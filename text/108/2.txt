In Palbaa to ba built up and remachinad.
This took a long time, and i n the meantime
someone with an eye to business had removed
a l l the Brasses, when these had been re-
placed sad the remachlned parte assembled
again the rebirth of 'Clementine1

Readers w i l l realise the aagaltud* of this task
by the fact that the crankshaft, which weighs
about one hundredweight, sad to be driven shout
a foot through the flywheel, which weighs twice
aa much. This Job was started before the Easter
Vac. and during the Vac. some very kind workmen
finished driving i t for us. I t i s unfortunate
to relate that i t was driven a tenth of an inch
too f a r . However, this difficulty was surmounted
I t was decided to try to get steam up on
Sunday 12th. May, and i n the ev*ning,after much
frustrating work on the pressure gauge, which
did not want to go on where i t had come off,
she slowly heaved herself round froa the yard
to the Hostel, and, after a short run, back to
her resting place. She was running again on
Wednesday, at 10 i n the morning this time, after
the driver and his mate had fired soon after
six. Th* following Saturday waa a momentous day,
"we want round Eros" the proud driver said.
Tea, indeed, 'Clementine1
had been driven along
Piccadilly and round Piccadilly Circus. Of
course, i t was too much to expect the Journey
to be uneventful. Coming back, one 'bus ran
into the back of another because i t s driver
was watching 'Clementine' i n his mirror; then
she did not have enough steam to climb to Hyde
Park Comer. After a short stop she built up
enough pressure, and, with whistle blasting,
she swept majestically xoaue the Comer.

KARAKORAM EXPEDITION
This summer will witness the culmination
of two years of industrious planning and organ-
isation by the Imperial College Exploration
Board and members of the Expedition. The Board
is to be congratulated on not having been de-
terred by such world events aa the Kashmir dia-
pute, which caused the Board to consider alter-
native areas for the Expedition, and the Suez
crisis which has entailed a change i n travelling
arrangements. The party of six, under the leader-l
ship of Mr. Eric Shipton, w i l l attempt the ascent
of Satoro Kangri (25,400frt) Topographical and
geological surveys w i l l be carried out. The
party has been fortunate in obtaining the serv-
ices of Mr. Eric Shipton, whose experience and
ability will be an immense asset. This expedition]
i s the f i r s t majorone since members of the Collegej
visited Jan Mayer Island i n 1938. The expedition
i s indebted to the Everest foundation for finan-
cial aid and advice. ,
GHANA (SOLD COAST) EXPEDITION
This expedition of seven people under the
leadership of N. D. Jago w i l l v i s i t the Gold
Coast area from July to October. This party of
entomologists, and botanists, veil study the
changes occurring when mature forest i s felled,
cultivated, and then allowed to return to sec-
ondary forest. This i s a matter of great impor-
tance i n tropical countries having a considerable
annual rainfall. This party i s to be congratulat-
ed oi. this industry and initiative, which has
enabled them to organise the expedition i n a
fairly abort time and obtain considerable finan-
c i a l support froa outside sources.

i s "What vent wrong this time ?" At present, i t
seams, something goes wrong every time; she has
had a long rest, and the present crew have hard-
l y handled her before. Th* crew feel sure that
i n these few runs they have found a l l her major
weaknesses, and that by the time she reaches the
rallies she i s destined to compete i n , she w i l l
be going 'like a bomb'.
LC.WA FISH-TANK
DEFINITE
At the last Union Council Meeting i t was
finally definitely decided to allow I.C.V.A.
to purchase a fish tank to put i n place of
the Trophy Cabinet i n their Lounge. This
decision was preceded by a great deal of fiery
discussion.
I t was pointed out that tha mortality rate
of f i s h waa very high and the question of th*
i r r i t a b i l i t y ' of fish towards beer was raised.
Who would look after them during the Vacation?
What would I.C.W.A. do with th* tank and i t s
contents i f , by any chance, they moved upstairs
to th* present email Lounge ?
In answer to this last question, Miss Wendy
Pipe said that I.C.W.A. would take i t with then
and mount i t on a stand, but anyway they had
not the slightest intention of moving froa
their present spacious and extra-lusuieu*
abode 1 The tentative proposition that the
Union Lounge should have a fish tank was re-
jected out of hand I I V \
It was decided that the Exploration Board

be restored after th* forthcoming darts match.
Aa a sequel to the Student Conference l a

The Chairman of the A.C.C. regretted that

that report. After presenting a few facts and
figures, be admitted that i t Bounded " some-
thing like a Market Report ".
In the S.C.C. report i t was stated that
