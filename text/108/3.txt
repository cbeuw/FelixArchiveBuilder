The University of London Lodgings Bureau
are now opening their next terrrfs application
l i s t in June. Each year, they say, the positior
becomes worse and worse. In our experience,
the Lodgings Bureau i s not very much help i n
finding digs within a mile radius of the col-
lege.
Undoubtedly i t i s advantageous to live
near the college: besides the obvious brnefit
of having no transport fares, less time wasted
and I P S S frustration incurred, there are the
additional benefits which may be obtained from
a fuller social l i f e - even eating at the Union
in the evening affects one's whole outlook (no
reflection on Mooney). Practically a l l digs
near I.e. are of the "room with no meals" type.
Most people coming to I.C. f i r s t take up their
abode at a "partial board" establishment, and
are placed by the Bureau even as far afield as
Ealing or Hounslow. A number of these move
nearer later in the year, and come to prefer
having just a room with no meals. I t i s sig-
nificant that those who do so seldom change
beck to partial board. The remark in the FELIX
lodgings Survey that 'the tyranny of Ealing land-
ladies i s ruining I.C." may have a grain of
truth running through its facetious surface.
The real Solution i s , of course, aaple
hostel accommodation. As this does not seem
to be forthcoming until the far, far distant
future, i t i s well worth paying the extr* to
take up residence in South Kensington - i t i s
not very difficult to find a suitable room i f
one i s prepared to take a l i t t l e trouble - and
besides having added social ^vantages, the more
serious side of college Life (which i s a l l too
imminent at present) i s -jade easier by having
the necessary libraries and laboratories oust
down the road.
In this, the final and Jubilee issue this
term, we reveal the identities of our regular
nonta-de-plume):
Our regular Nelson (so-called because of
the telescope he operates i n the FELIX room
overlooking Q.A.) i s none other than red-beard-
ed, Mephistoptiilian D i d Saunders, now notorious
as last issue's Slitor - which, incidentally,
was the best issue yours truly has seen for a
long time.
The Nelson of issue 106 well-deserves his
name now that I've blacked his eye for organising
the profile on page 7 - of which, by the way,
not a word i s true - and should know better be-
cause he i s our previous Editor, John Bramley.
He has also masqueraded under the pseudonym of
Daedalus for the past three issues.
Last week's Nelson i s happier with an Indian
ink pen than with a typewriter, and despite re-
peated attenps to frustrate his efforts, Pat
Billinghflm manages to slip a cartoon or something
into FELIX each Issue - usually "something".
FELIX i s no one man's paper, and i s published
by a team - the Edi o r i a l Board who i s led by the
Sditor. The Editor i s remmnsible to a Board
of Directors who are the Student Officers(sea
Blue Book), but these latter interfere as l i t t l e
as possible with the x\oming of the paper. Let
us hope i t remains so. FELIX mas always been the
t a t Who Walked by Himself" and has -rovided a
platform for independent -nvsarn* - no mere Union-
controlled paper as at other colleges. I t has
had a firm basis for doing this by being finan-
c i a l l y independent. It i s becoming very difficult
to maintain this this position, since ve mske a
total profit of 8/- on a complete sell-out of 1200
eopies - and tmta has to pay for pepmr. ink,
pencils etc. So, i f yam man* year cat te keep
em walking by himself, i t l a eamemtlal that eeoh
person buys hjj, 2S2L copy.

Dear S i r ,
I feel i t i s about tine that the true
nature of the "Fair Sex* was revealed. For
too long now, women have been deluding them-
selves (and the males of the human speoies
have been encouraging them) into thinking
they are the most beautiful creatures on
earth.
For this, i f i t were true, would be
truly remarkable, since i s i t not a general
rule i n the animal kingdom that i s i s the
male of a species which has the more attrac-
tive appearance and the more beautiful
colouring? One only needs t o look at the ducks
in the park to realise this, and i s i t not
the b u l l elephant that has the larger and
more beautiful tusks, the male robin whioh
has the flaming red torso, and the lion whioh
I has a mane to enhance his noble appearanoe?
It i s my b e l i e f 3ir, that the human
species i s not an exception to this general
rule, women are not the most attractive
creatures on earth;- the men are* However,
i t i s probably not f o r us to spoil the
illusions of these poor unfortunate woman.
After a l l we can afford to l e t them have this
small pleasure.
It i s with the knowledge that I belong
to that band of irresistable beings of the
male persuasion that I sign myself,
F. Psacook.
Dear S i r ,
In issue 106 you stated that Nelson's
Column had been penned by a new Kelson and
that lasus 107 would S M a reversion to the
original writer. I suggest that this was
not carried out. TMO last three issue* shew
three distinct styles under ths ens Son de
Plums. 106 i s sharp, v i t r i o l i c and to the
point; 105 (at preo) waffles round and be-
ooates rather long winded but he gets there
in the end; 107 i s very leag winded, hardly
v i t r i o l i c , and rather juvenile i n his wit
and I also suspect that he i s using his
space for private digs at personal aouain-
tanoes, whioh the writer of such a ooloan
should b. above.
May I muraiaeeiwl that 106 he given the
job permanently, 105 (*t preo) be thanks*
sad retired graewfully to stud and that 107
(not et aao. I trust) be sacked Ignoaunioas-
iy.
Slnosrely. •**•
