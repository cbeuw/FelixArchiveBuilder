great privilege and honour that Her Majesty

declare open the Roderio H i l l Building, and
to unveil an inscription to S i r Roderio.
In her reply, Her Majesty spoke of her
own contacts with tha College over a period
°f many years, and the great pleasure she
had In participating i n these Jubilee c e l -
ebrations. She reiterated the closeness of
the links of the College with the Royal Fam-
i l y , and emphasised the present day need f o r
Centres of Learning devoted to the Teohnol-

new building open.
In his reply, the Rector, i n a somewhat
lighter vein, mentioned that the two Sciences
of Chemical Engineering and Aeronautics were
in the forefront of modern developaenta.
