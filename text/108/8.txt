BOAT CLUB SWEEPS THE BOARD
DNHJKRSITI OF LONDON ALLOM CUP REGATTA
Imperial Collage Boat Club a l l But swept tha hoard at Chiswiok on Saturday
In tho U.L.U. Regatta, 1,0. won four of the events out of tha f i r e f o r whioh our orems
wore entered. The results below show tho extant of tho I.C. Tiotorjr.
Alloa Cup; Won by I*C. l a t . T i l l .
Roderick H i l l
Memorial Trophy: Wen by I.C. 2nd. VIII.
Clinker Eights Won by 1.0. 3rd. VIII.
Potter Cup f o r
single sculls: Won by Martin Gaylard
Imperial College.
A l l crews rowed well and the l s t . eight
were particularly inpressive being able to
win their races by clear margins. The second
eight showed that they have pace, and had
some good racing. The t h i r d sight seamed to
be losing their f i n a l but pulled up to win
by two lengths margin. Martin Gaylard had
l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t y i n retaining the trophy
which he won l a s t year. These results are
encouraging and we hops the upper Bights w i l l
be i n similar winning form i n the up-river
regattas to ooma.
The team has had a f a i r l y success-
ful year, coming t h i r d i n the U.L.. water
polo league, and t h i r d im the swimming
ohampoinship.
Harford, Loveman, and Clark have
swum for the University f i r s t team, and Robin-
son and Ccrrigan f o r the second team.
The heats of ths U.L. swimming champion-
ships were held ia Chelsea Baths on Friday
24th. May and a l l ths I.C. men entered,
went through to the finals. On our showing
i n the heats, i t looked as i f we would corns
second to King's, though with a l i t t l e luok
we might beat them.
In the finals on Saturday, however, we
did not l i v e up to this premiss (too much
beer?), and were reduced from seoond t o third
place by Battersea i n the f i n a l event.
Roger Harford i s to be congratulated on
breaking the championship Backstroke record
in 66.} sees.
SWIMMING
CRICKET
The l s t . Eleven continues to improve,
winning three out of the last four matches.
Against Royal Vets, I.C. totalled 117,
while Royal Vets were shot out for 37 due
mainly t o tho bowling of Bhatti (7-18).
Against Trinity Hall, I.C. were a l l
out f o r 79 on a nasty wioket and. Trinity Hall
were 54-5 when the weather put on end t o ths
prospect of a olose finish. On the following
Wednesday, Goldsmith were dismissed for 74
and I.C. passed t h e i r t o t a l with four wickets
to f a l l . due, mainly to a good knock by Kitoh
(34 n.o.)
Oh Saturday, R.N. College, Greenwich
rattled up 182-4 i n about two hours, but I.C.
were hot to be outdone and knocked off the
runs i n just under 2 hours for five wickets.
The main contributors were Kapur (63), Hearn
(50) - playing for the side f o r the first
Urns this season and showing more than
usual restraint, due we are t o l d to a shoulder
disability - and Bhatti (31).
The fielding has l e f t muoh to be desired
but the dropped catch k i t t y has gained as a
result. The heavy social programme especially
on Friday's prior to Saturday matches has
had considerable effect upon the mobility of
ths sids in the f i e l d .
Results: I.C. 117 ('Eapur 28 Bhatti 26)
Boyal Vets 37 (Bhatti 7-18)
I.C. 79 (Murdsn 26)
Trinity Hall 54-4 (Bhatti 3-39)
Goldsmith's 74 (Mettle 4-17.
Dytham 3-30)
I.C. 75-6 (Eitohenmr 34 n.o.)
R.H.C. Greenwich 182-4 doe.
I.C. 183-5 (Kapur 67, Beam 50,
Bhatti 31)
The 2nd. Eleven after drawing their first
five matches, beat Goldsmith!s by 20 runs and
on Saturday, Baling Dean by 8 wiokets.
Ths Sunday Eleven goes from strength to
strength, although recently operated on for
a splinter in his right hand, Dr. K» Wools
has shows his usual form. R. Dytham loudly
iroalalma his potential as a batsmen amd
oonseenently was presetted to open in a
reosnt match. The lunohtims soars of
178-1 (Dythem 0 (out), Oggi 78, Gnome 89)
did nothing to advance his elustariasp.

GUILDS MOTOR CLUB
Once again the City and Guilds Motor Club
disturbed the peace and quiet of 311wood Park
with the sounds of sliding tyres and bouncing
valves with the addition this year of soggy
curses by all concerned, for torrential rain
accompanied the entire rally.
The rally consisted of a regularity run
out to Silwood, driving tests in the park and
• high speed pub crawl round Burnhsa.
The wet conditions did sot appear to dam-
pen any enthusiasm and produced hairy perform-
ances ripe and plenty.
The highlight of the day was probably the
Flat-outblind round the parade ground and m
e
m
-
orable moments include the incredible perform-
ance of Jarria and his Austin Sevan, sad ths
near collection of a telegraph pole by a black
Anglia.
An oanswal coupsti tor was licks1
Saartin
taxi and its large crew of popsies who ate
sandwiches through ovary test.
All praise is due to the marshals whs re-
mained cheerful under appal ling conditions
sad slso to ths competitors who could not he
seduced by the warm rhsiij comforts of ths
Thatched Tavern, prsfariag to blind round ths
Farads Ground with not a cars for the Ministry
of Fuel sad Power sad their little coupons.
The winner was Sanderson (M.S.) from ths
Inter-Tarsity Clab and the first Cmlldsmsn
X. Wood (Austin Seven).
ATHLETICS
Support f o r the club has revived consider-
ably im the last few matohes. On the evening
cf Wed. 15th. of May, we l e f t the Union cram-
med into two oars heading for Parliament
H i l l Fields. Back Hick's Taxi got o f f to an
early start and won easily. Tony Smith's
J a l o p y , i n fast persuit, was delayed at
Lancaster Gate when, due to the proximity of
the brake and accelerator pedals, we h i t the
rear of a shooting-brake. However, tho occu-
pants clambered out, separated the ears, and
with loud cheering we ware on our way again.
Jockeying with other vehicles for position
in the centre of the road we hardly noticed
a polioeman who had tojump f o r his l i f e onto
the pavement.
Royal Vet' a C o l l . and Northern Poly-
technic were very weak and we won easily.
Apart from N. Poly's individual winner i n
ths sprints we took l s t . place i n every
event.
In the match against St. Mary's Training
College, the following Saturday, we had good
opposition and were narrowly beaten,. The
final result (65-73) was undecided u n t i l ths
last event (the relay) was run.
Two recent matches were cancelled because
out* opponents were unable to ralss teams.
There are only two more matches to be played
before ear successful season closes but i t
i s hoped that a l l athletes w i l l s t i l l compete
and we wish everyone good luck i n their
home-club fixtures, particularly i n ths
Bounty Champs, tomorrow.
The Athletic Club A.O.M. w i l l be held
today, F r i . May 31st. , and a l l members are
urged to attend.
SAILING
In a match against HamDton Sailing Club
held on May 25th. at Hampton the club did well
to win by 5f points taking revenge for i t s
defeat i n the winter.
The match was sailed i n 14ft. Merlin-
locket class dingies, a new experience for
most of the I.C. team. The strong and very
variable winds provided some interesting
sailing; crews being overpowered at times and
shifting water.
M. Collyer won the first race, although
handicapped by having the lightest crew-weight
in the race. C. French and J.D. Webb used
their length and weight effectively to go very
fast, but were forced to retire i n attempt-
ing to gain second place.
The second race provided even more interest
for crews and spectators alike. Soon after the
start one of the Hampton boats capaired after
a minor collision. On the down-wind sections
of the course M. Collyer successfully set a
spinnaker, although no-one had used than '
in the first race. Other crews followed suit -
with spectacular results - as boats only just
under control hurtled up the river. I.C. f i n i -
shed lst., 4th. and 5th., the points lead
obtained in the f i r s t race being augumented by
another 2\ points
I.C. Tesmx J.E. Smith - A-J. Danbury

J. Webb - C. French. i
