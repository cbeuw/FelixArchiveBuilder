If this profile i e rather diajoiated, i t i a
because our esteemed Editor keeps coming into
the Felix room to see how the make-up i s getting
on. After the last R.C.S. Carnival - at about
two i n the morning - peculiar moaning noises
were heard to be issuing from a Hostel bathroom.
Dave comes from Cardiff and i s at pres-
ent finishing the Chemistry Course after four
very active years. His outside interests include
The source of these groans proved to be
stark naked apart from his Felix t i e and was
slumped taking several roles i n I.C. Dram-
atic Society productions; rowing (Vice-Captain
of R.C.S.Boats and member of this year's Horphy
Crew); thyroid-deep i n a lukewarm soapy
solution, when after considerable fumbling he
was dressed by,. serious music, and, as a
member of I.C. Choir, strangely enough,
himself shivering i n a high-pitched voice, he
allowed himself to be led singing bass.
Of course, apart from these activities, he took
on the job of sales manager of Felix at the
beginning of this Session, taking over the
Editorship i n January. He may: retire
to Les Allen's room from which advantageous
position he proopded to fling coffee over his
Art Editor's trousers. Before dropping into a
coma, Dave remarked: " I t will be alright i n
the morning ? " - hence the origination of the
term "to Gryff" - to make a general nuisance of
himself.......for two year's holiday i n the
R.A.F. at the end of this term? His 'likes',
he says, are "the usual things, anything edible,
bed, people i n general and El^ep to get away
from i t a l l . " His dislikes are: "aherry(too much)
cliques and people who make others f^el small."
We think that he has been a jolly good Editor
and we wish him the best of luck in the future.
THE EDITORS FAREWELL.
A l a s ! 0 r e a d e r s , I b i d a d i e u ,
This i s the l a s t I w r i t e f o r you,
The time has come t o say goodbye
W i t h wishes best t o you f o r aye.
Two terms I have the E d i t o r been,
W i t h what r e s u l t ' c a n now be seen,
I've done ray b e s t , f o r good or i l l ,
But you inust judge me i f you w i l l .
To ray s u c c e s s o r l e t me w i s h
The best w i s h i n our FELIX d i s h ,
That he may serve t o r a i s e up h i g h
The f l a g o f t r u t h we always f l y .
And so t o end, t o r e a d e r s a l l ,
B e s t wishes f o r the J u b i l e e B a l l ,
And f o r exams, the best o f l u c k
That you may always pass the buck.
The E d i t o r makes no a p o l o g i e s f o r t h i s
v e r s e as he i s not the FELIX poet who
i s r e s p o n s i b l e f o r i t s Genesis and
o n l y p r i n t s i t so t h a t he can save
h i m s e l f some hard work.
I have heard i n the past many disparaging
reamarks about meals passed by those eating
regularly i n the refeotory at Silwood Park. On
the other hand, those who have attended Touch-
stone Weekends have praised the food there.
However, during the last three and a half
weeks, I have been l i v i n g at the F i e l d Station
and have studied the refectory carefully. F i r s t -
l y I shall tabulate some facts and observations:
1. "Charges for meetings Rebates on meals
i f 6 hours notice
given
Breakfast: 2/6 1/9
Lunch: 3/6 2/9
Supper: 3/- 2/3
2. Typioal meals during three weeks :
a) Breakfast ( i ) 5" dessert plate of cereal
(almost invariably com flakes)
( i i ) One rasher of bacon with a
tablespoonful of baked beans or two boiled eggs.
(Occasional variation: a boiled kipper; two
sausages and beans, or two sardines on toast).
( i i i ) urn tea, toast (grudgingly
given), marmalade.
b) Lunch ( i ) Soup - 5 ladleful.
( i i ) Roast beef or lamb (usually
well cooked), mashed potatoes and one other veg-
etable (usually cabbage, occasionally leaks or
peas).
( i i i ) Dessert - about 2d. worth of
ice-cream and one wafer, or a small portion of
f r u i t and custard or meringue.
o) Supper (t) 2 small sausages and mashed
potatoes, cr 2 poached eggs on toast, or 2 saus-
ages (small) chips and half a tomato.
( i i ) Dessert - an apple or an
orange or a piece of cake, or sweet as at lunch,
or cheap chaddar cheese and two biscuits, NO tea.
3. The meal times are often inconvenient and the
eaters are made to hurry by the Manager who has
been seen to put the refectory clock back before
a meal - perhaps i t was not ready - and then put
i t forward again during the meal. At weekends
students are expected to wash up their own crock-
ery.
4. A waitress service i s especially laid on for
Touchstone Weekends but the normal resident has
even to do his own washing up on Saturdays and
Sundays. The standard of food varies considerab-
ly from good food for Touchstone, reasonable
food for engineering field courses to a mere
subsistence for residents. The main bulk of
the food for the latter i a provided by bread
and jam.
5. The Refectory Committee i s composed of the
following:-
Hr. Savage - i n charge of Silwood Park - who
never eats i n the Refectory.
Two members of staff, one who goes home for
lunch and one who comes i n rarely to find a
temporary marked improvement.
Two student members, one who has never been
seen i n the Refectory, and the President of S i l -
wood Park Committee.
I would like to add to these facts some
suggestions and comments:
1. In the opinion of the majority of refectory
users, the present manager baa never been sat-
isfactory. He has now resigned and should have
been asked to do so long ago.
I suggest that at tha moment th* Refectory
is grossly overstaffed, and I further think
teat two cooks, instead of three, with an Ass-
istant and no Refectory Manager would be suff-
icient. Also, i f these could be recruited from
one of the colleges of domestic science, then
sot only would their wage* be less aa a result
of both being Inexperienced and also female
they could live in the hostel, or th* vacated
flat of tb* present manager - and would be ia
contact of the consumers. Perhaps they would
also be allowed to uae Onion facilities.
2. It appear* ridiculous that th* majority of
the members of the Refectory Committee do not
as* the Refectory. I would suggest that at
least three of the five ba elected from the
ooneuasrs.
Qantinued in time next oolnan.
The sun i s shining, the windows are
clean and on this oocasion of a second
v i s i t from our Royal V i s i t o r , Nelson i s
fed up with being nasty and niggling. To
-hell with the t r a d i t i o n of the job, the
column i s going to be NICE.
Three cheers f o r the landscape gar-
deners who have shown that a job oan be
done on time with impeccable workmanship.
Even those who regretted the passing of
the tennis oourts are impressed.
Congratulations to Jennifer Heywood
on her election as Queen of dis-May
long may the Icwamazons thrive under her
leadership. To aid her in the more
important aide of her work, I have a wide
mouthed k e t t l e , tawo canvas buckets and a
disâ€”used o i l drum which may well be useful.
And three cheers f o r the fact that
the dreaded Wendy Pipe has been l a i d low -
but, no - lets be nice. One cheer for
Wendy Pipe.
Since the I.C.W.A. common room i s
to have i t s fish-tank, one begins to see
the idea behind those who wish to form a
Sub-Aqua Club. Is there no length to
which the v i r i l e I.C. male w i l l not go i n
its hunt for the quarry ? Anyway, three
cheers.
A special cheer for a l l the ladies
who remove the traces of'sport'from
our1
surroundings in tha mornings after.
Long may they continue to sweep deftly
around the "incapables", restoring order
to what seems, in the moring at any rate,
to be a rather squalid chaos.
A very big hurray f o r tha Entertain-
ments committee. As their year comes to
a close, the column ie thankful for those
who spend a considerable amount of time and
energy on a job with l i t t l e kudos. Their
'piece de resistance', the Jubilee B a l l ,
is typioal of the large scale of their ent-
erprises. And tha loudest cheer in this
case i s a helping hand for Richard Garnett
and c
o . .
Being forced to a niggle by "the boss"
the column finds i t s e l f having to say -
'hurray'for those who came back from the
Touchstone week-end by coach. A p p a r e n t i y
a lot of those who went came back by other
means and wasted the coach - I suppose
we s h a l l have to have'a l i t t l e 'boo' f o r
them.
As a last glorious, generous gesture,
Hurray for the readers of F e l i x , for the
Editor and tha iJomeetlc Bursar.

3. Silwood Park grows a large quantity of veget-
ables, surely a little co-operation between the
cooks and Head Gardener would give a cheeper
source of food.
4. In the past, the Refectory Coaaittee, or at
least soma member* of it, have tried to change
things. One gate the impression that red tape
and inefficiency In tb* collage aoalaletzetlon
rather t i * * their hands.
