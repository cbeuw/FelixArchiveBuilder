INDEPENDENT COMMENT
THREE POINT LANDING
BY D a e d a l u s
So we have elected s i x new Council 'Heps'
and an Entertainments Committee. A significant
statement. "We" being 15)6 of the Onion member-
ship; "elected" i s perhaps the wrong word. Most
of those present did not know a l l the candidates
Of course, these were asked to show themselves
to the asaemby, but a student's appearance i s
no guide to whether he i s fittsd for a partic-
ular job. I t seems that a 'postal' ballot and
soma tasteful electioneering by the candidates
and their backers might produce a more effective
and representative Council and Entertainments
Committee. The present system, however, i s
bound to elect the few very good leaders who
would also be elected by any other method.
But i t i s the other 5>£ of the Council or Com-
mittee that must be queried. At present these
tend to be elected by virtue of the fact that
their names are known because of their foot-
balling or rowing records. I f a Onion Govern-
ment i s elected by a minority, i t i s not i n a
very strong position to negotiate with other
bodies - whatever i t may i t s e l f think.
The radio set i n the Onion Lounge stands
as a telling monument to the behaviour of
those who Dretend to set an example to the
rest of the College as to bow to behave In
the New Building. We have had no public
apology from those concerned, and one wonders
how Mr. Kitchener, as a Rugby Club man, could
have the nerve to admonish the few members
who have occasionally left a raincoat i n the
Lounge. At the next years A.G.M. the Presid-
ent of the Christmas Islanders may rise to de-
liver the following speech: " I am frightfully
sorry, you chaps, that after our Annual Coffee
Party this year, we went to Harlington with a
two-man saw and cut down a l l the rugby posts.
Tou really must forgive ue"(chuckles)" but we
were under the effects of our mescalin taking!"
Our worthy 8.C.C. Chairman and his friends
are noted for their oratory and charm. They are
also noted for their dubious judgement. In his
Annual Report, Mr. Allen t e l l s the Onion that
ths Conservative Society had not sent i n a re-
port to the S.C.C. and that perhaps this was
due to their having been overcome by ths effects
of Cyprus, forth Lewishea aad Sues. Of course
i t may be ridiculous to take umbrage at this
amusing l i t t l e remark, and Mr. Pretty mill
have been wise to ignore i t . Mr. Allen, however,
should be careful what he says. The College
M.I.5. agent (disguised as a well-known sport-
ing type) was seen to note his words with glee.
Should Mr. Allen want one day to entsr Pakistan
he nay well find his entry barredI
