We hare received the following letter:
Lest Issue of FELIX discussed on i t s front
page "the most sensational and Mysterious events
St I.C. for some years". Since the details of my
ease have been made public and have now been
partially settled i n so far as I am now allowed
to take part i n the expedition, I think i t only
f a i r that I should clear up several misunderstand-
ings and also say a public thank you _ i h FELIX
to those who helped me i n the week previous to
the case being discussed i n Parliament.
I was informed that approval for the Expedi-
dition to enter Pakistan was known in London
at the end of February. Was i t coincidence
that we informed the Foreign Office, when they a
asked us, what was the last possible date we
must know of Pakistan approval, not later than
April 24th. and on that date the Exploration
Board were informed that a l l could go except
myself? Was this because l i t t l e time would be
l e f t for us to create a fuss?
Staff members of the Board met and tried to
move heaven and earth at the Foreign Office,
but of no avail and I am not surprised since
received the same treatment myself as did
Barbara Castle with Lord Home, To those members
of the Board who tried, i n particular
Prof, Read and Asst. Prof, Stevenson I have
already given my sincere thanks.
On Sunday 28th. April I returned home from a
training Expedition and Pip Pairhurst had the
unpleasant job of telling me the bad news and i t
appeared to be an irrevocable decision,
but since a three year dream could not be broken
by communications of which I new nothing
I immediately travelled to London.
The Pakistan High Commissioner, His Excellency
Mohammad Ikramul lah proved to be sincere and
lpful but regretted that he could do nothing
at a l l . The trouble obviously lay i n the Foreign
Office but I alone could do nothing at a l l there
so I contacted my M.P. but not before I was
informed, as were many of my friends, that any
effort on my part would probably prejudice the
Expedition. Who had told the Board this strange
story? Was i t , as one newspaper put i t ,
"Security gone mad"?
At the Board meeting two members of the
expedition were told the facts, and I believe
they also were asked to keep i t quiet so that
the expedition should not suffer - this was
justifiable since the expedition comes f i r s t and
last - but i t left me almost fighting alone
except for the immediate inspiring support I
received from Geoff Bratt and•Peter Brazier.
Then came the news that the expedition was 'on'
under any circumstances, so Chris Gravine was
informed and I saw the Rector.
The rest you a l l know, the Onion rallied
around under the leadership of the President,
and i n two days they worked wonders. I w i l l
always be indebted to Kitch, Prank Irving, Prof.
Saunders, Dean of Guilds, Ken Weale, Mrs. Robb,
a l l of whom either gave or promised help. Their
efforts were successful.
Kov general comments.
1. I t i s my belief that government security
agents have access to reports on the activities
of a l l students at I.C. and i t Is therefore not
advisable to say "Dear old Adolf" or "Joe for
King".
2. I s t i l l do not know the reason for the ban
which would have stopped any Himalaya trek but
not an Alpine on*.
J. Joke: Pete Brazier, the reserve, had his
innoculations in case my plea failed. He sank
into unconsciousnsss and when he awoke i n great
agon; heard that I had, after a l l , won the day.
Peter's letter of congratulations was one I
shall keep for ever under my f i l e of "Friends".
4. Finally, to a l l tho** who helped, be they
students. Member* of Parliament, Members of the
aoveming Body and staff, I say a very sincere
you",
