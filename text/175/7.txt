Oarsmen and scullers of Imperial Col-
lege Boat Club competed in three major
open events last term. Their opposition was
drawn from the best in Great Britain, al-
though foreign crews were encountered this
year, yet they acquitted themselves well.
Three VIII's were entered for the
Reading University Head of the River Race
on 17th March, and these started in the pos-
itions attained by their equivalents last year.
Thus the first VIII started 4th, the second,
21st, and the third, 46th. They finshed 7th.
40th, and 76th out of a total entry of 145.
Tncidently. the race was won. in a tie, by
the University of London crew in a time just
31 seconds faster than the 16 min. 25 sec.
returned by the first VIII for the 3J mile
course.
Two weeks later, seven crews of I.C.B.C.
took to their VIII's* together with nearly
tihree hundred others, for the 4£ mile Head
of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney;
the hard facts are summarised in the table.
But for the gallants who started 294th, all
the College crews lost ground.
In their race on 14th April over the Same
A\ mile course, the scullers M . E . Gaylard,
J.H. Ainsley and J. King were 30th, 134th,
and 142nd respectively of 169 entries.
The term's results, although poorer than
last year's, are nevertheless praiseworthy. The
victory in the race for the Dixon Bowl has
been reported, and at Reading the Club crews
proved faster than not only all London col-
leges, but the fastest Oxford and Cambridge
colleges as well.
However, if there are no grounds for dis-
may, there are none for complecency either.
The club members are entering the summer
regatta season with a determination to win and
to enjoy themselves which is surely unmatched
in any other club. Finally, as the club is
smaller than usual this year, it is finding it
difficult to provide enough support and en-
couragement for competing crews. Consequ-
ently, if you have any interest in the sport,
come and add your yells — and thirst —
to many others; we hope that you will find
rowing so attractive that you will become a
"wet-bob" yourself!

Since last Monday, April 30th, there has
been an exhibition of paintings and draw-
ings by members of the I.C. Art Club on view
in the Physics building, levels 2 and 3. This
exhibition continues until next Thursday,
May 10th. Perhaps the Art Club needs some
explanation as some uninformed people claim
not to have heard of us. It is a club, sponsored
and subsidised by General Studies, whose
aim is quite simply to provide instruction
in painting and drawing for members of
Imperial College. The lessons are held every
Wednesday afternoon in the Royal College
of Art, during the first two terms of the year.
A l l this exhibits on show are of work
done during these classes, and it is best to re-
member this, for it explains and defines the
limitations of the exhibition. Firstly there is
the limitation of subject matter. We paint and
draw nudes almost all the time. To attempt
to draw the human figure is difficult but
once you have begun to realise what is in-
volved in trying to describe shapes in relat-
ion to surroundings and the light directed
upon them, then you have begun to under-
stand a little of what artists are trying to
do. Secondly there is the limitation of scope.
We do not paint finished masterpieces me-
asured by the square yard. There just isn't
time. Less than three hours per week is not
long enough to do anything near what we
would want, and much of the work we do
must of necessity be incomplete and some-
times sketchy.
We acknowlege these limitations but feel
that they enhance rather fihan detract from
the exhibition. Here are people like your-
selves attempting to put down on paper what
they have seen, not often succeding but al-
ways trying and gaining a great deal of
pleasure in the process. We hope that you
in turn may derive pleasure from looking :

t
these exhibits, comparing and contrasting, re-
alising the problems that are involved and
the very real excitement that is to be gained
from painting and drawing.
If you are at all interested in these classes,
please get in touch with me, Tony Musgrave.
the Art Club secretary, for full details of
times and places. From Wednesday. May
2nd, we are holding summer out door sket-
ching classes, and the usual classes at the
College of Art restart next October.
