FELIX
Ever had that guilty feeling about cars?
Y o u are torn between a passionate love
affair for buying, cleaning, owning and
running a car and that little bit of guilt
about the destructive consequences; the
pollution, w h i c h is slowly killing the
planet and people.
A s cars become easier to drive, the
concentration required to drive them
decreases. M o d e r n cars are stuffed with
home comforts: C D players and radios
with stereo, dolby N R quadraphonic all
round-sound telephones and even faxes! It
is easy to forget you are not at home as
you speed at over 120kph d o w n that
smooth, straight road, 'brain dead' and
numbed with boredom. With the
compulsory wearing of seat belts
becoming law, the number of minor
collisions increased. People instantly felt
safer and concentration lapsed even
more. During a journey a driver is
typically thinking about driving for only
7 5 % of the time. This means that every
fourth driver coming towards you o n the
road is not concentrating.
The human brain was not designed for
controlling a rapidly moving object. W h e n
walking, the average person looks less
than a metre ahead. Joggers look a little
further, and at thirty miles an hour w e
still only focus at a point about a cricket
pitch length i n front of the car.
Consequently, with stopping distances at
motorway speeds many times this
distance, accidents are only too common.
Thirty people are killed every two days
on British roads, yet if there are thirty
fatalities from a train crash, it is declared
a national disaster. In fact the single
death which resulted from the Cannon

Street rail crash at the beginning of this
year warranted it 'national disaster',
requiring inquiries, public outcry and
press hype.
Out of all the cars sold each year i n
Britian, 6 0 % are secondhand. Despite this,
a staggering 35 million n e w cars are
produced each year worldwide. That's
one car each second. Go to sleep at night
and 30,000 n e w cars have been created
before y o u wake in the morning. Sneeze
and five cars are born into the world.
Thankfully for us, at the moment, the
third world's reliance o n the internal
combustion engine is not as great as ours.
There are currently 500 million cars i n
the world. If China had cars to' the same
ratio as the U S A then they alone would
have 500 million cars. In eastern Europe
they are experiencing their first freedom
for many years and car manufacturers
are 'meeting the challenge'.
If the car density of north Europe is to
spread to the rest of the w o r l d it will
have serious environmental
consequences. Even unleaded petrol still
contains hundreds of potentially harmful
toxins. The world cannot support this
; level of growth i n air pollution. T h e
I predicament cannot be stressed more
clearly than this, but as with all these
environmental problems, the
consequences are not immediate.
Destruction and poisons accumulate, out
of sight, until it is too late. T h e hole i n
the ozone layer is invisible and the
greenhouse effect just means warmer
summers to a lot of people.
So what is the answer? This incurable
love affair that man has with his car is
more than just an extension to his
genitals, a statement of his sexual
prowess. T h e freedom of transport has
been a 'human right' since m a n climbed
on the back of a beast and rode it. T h e
car, simply an evolution of this beast, is a
political hot potato. A n y government who
bars this freedom of driving will be in
political isolation for a long while. T h e
right to travel where w e want, when w e
want is taken for granted, yet i n
congested Britain the 'freedom of the
open road' is a joke. Millions would
rather crawl in queues all day like sheep,
than use public transport. Why?
Using public transport is estimated to
be the equivalent of 130-200 mpg per
passenger, so it is preferable if it can
provide a reliable service, which is cheap,
clean and secure, particularly for women
at night.
The old excuse that 'public transport
isn't efficient' is outdated. It seems
doubtful that the improvements i n public
transport called for b y organisations such
as E T A (a mass membership transport
users organisation) would solve the
problems. Psychologists explain that
people can't relax o n public transport.
Y o u can't pick your nose, break wind or
have sex o n a bus or in a train! Y o u
haven't got complete freedom of
movement and behaviour that the
isolated capsule of a car gives you.
In whatever guise, the car is here to
stay. Its use is threatening to rise
83-142% i n the next 35 years. Despite
this, governments, vehicle manufacturers
and drivers all have a role to play i n
reducing the impact of the car o n the
environment. The first electric car was
released i n 1986. It instantly acquired the
status of a rusty Robin Reliant and was
shunned b y the public. Electric vehicles
still have the prestige of a milk float or a
sewing machine, associated with menial
work. No finely tuned growl from
beneath the bonnet, no chromed exhaust
pipe, no need for fuel injection, and no
place for Turbo lag! But are Britain's
motorists so blinkered? Electric motors
require less maintenance mile for mile.
No frozen diezel i n the winter, no anti-
freeze required, and no burst radiators.
To improve the appeal of the electric
vehicle you have to analyse what it is
that sells a car. Although cars are bought
primarily for getting from A to B, the
looks, performance and, of course, the
name are all important. A logo o n the
ignition key sitting o n the bar in the pub
speaks volumes! T h e 'GTi' badge or the
word 'Turbo' tattooed o n the boot are a
must. T h e image and profile of a car will
make or break it.
Each car has its label, w h i c h the person
behind the wheel automatically inherits.
Be it a welly-green Range Rover, a
Ferrari-red Porsche or a white 2 C V w e all
have a picture of the sort of person who
would drive it. This label is to a certain
extent controlled by the manufacturer.
Peugeot's advert for its 405 range
featuring the car driving through a
burning field to the song 'Take m y Breath
A w a y ' did more for sales of that car than
any other car advert in marketing
history. T h e n e w Lotus Carlton is
advertised by being capable of a top
speed of 176mph. But where and why?
Paul Tosch, Vauxhall's chairman admits
that it is an ego trip. 'We wanted to show
that w e could do it. It's an image car'.
Simon Dyer, Director General of the A A
criticises this as environmentally
irresponsible. Manufacturers should no
longer use speed and high performance
to advertise and sell cars. 'It is time to be
proud of cars because they are safe and
have a m i n i m u m impact o n the
enivronment.'
Battery technology is no longer the
limiting factor of a potential electric car.
What is needed is a well established
manufacturer to set the trend i n electric
vehicles. Something instantly desirable to
nurture man's incurable love affair with
the motor car, not turn him off; the
'Lotus Electron' or the 'Ford Sierra XR4e'.
Such machines must be sold at realistic
and competitive prices.
Unlike other 'green consumerism' the
public don't have the power to initialise
the change to the electric vehicle. Once a
realistic vehicle is available, government
action is needed to initiate the transfer to
the elctric motor-car. Only higher fuel
prices will be the spur, to ensure that
polluters pay.
Of course this converson to electric
vehicles is not going to solve congestion
problems o n the roads. N e w road building
just generates more traffic jams and is not
an answer to the problem either. A s long
as Britain's blinkered motorists want the
freedom to pick their noses in whichever
traffic jam they please, our roads will
always be clogged.
The first challenge is to cut the exhaust
emissions from the millions of stationary
cars. Until electric vehicles are freely
available, choosing a car w h i c h delivers
more miles per gallon and making sure it
is properly tuned will both help to lower
fuel consumptio+i. Alternatively a little
k n o w n device called the 'Petromizer'
could help. Currently marketed by
Marvelawn International at just under S50
it guarantees 10-16% lower fuel
consumption, more power and reduced
toxic emissions. Consequently companies
like Shell are keen to keep it a secret.
The Petromizer consists of a powerful bar
magnet which simply attaches to the
outside of the fuel line. Quite w h y it
works is not k n o w n , but the magnet
apparently reduces the surface tension of
the fuel, producing better atomisation and
increasing combustion efficiency. For
