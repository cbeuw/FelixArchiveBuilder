Dear Mr Felix Editor,
W h y , oh why, oh why?
W h y one: I thought that
correspondence 'battles' had been banned
from F E L I X (due to previous experiences),
so w h y the 'Athena vs El-Kholy'
exchange?
W h y two: W h y do you insist on writing
about the CNS broadcasting network?
W h o are they? I've heard of C N N and
CBS—or does F E L I X have some sort of
scoop regarding the merger of the two
aforementioned networks? (Same mistake
in Issue 889 stop press, w h i c h turned out
to be incorrect about the chemical
warhead statement anyway.)
W h y three: I read the article about the
recent refurbishment of the Union Cafe
and Games R o o m , with Shanley's
comment that 'it's going really well'.
What justification is there for this:
-the pinball machine (if it can be called
that) is really shite and there is only one
machine, pinball was quite popular last
year as I recall, and this 'new' machine is
nowhere near the same calibre as the
replaced machines;
-the removal of the table football
would, I imagine, annoy some people,
although the pool table replacement
would admittedly satisfy others...
-...but how can someone play pool in
that room when shots are limited due to
the fact that the video machines obstruct
play;
-these machines do not appear to be as
popular as the Gauntlet/OutRun/Hero
Turtle etc machines (although I suppose
only time will tell);
-the carpet is jolly nice though, and I'm
sure will be easy to clean w h e n people
spill their pints/guts, or drop fag ash etc
on it.
So, W H Y ! !
Yours,
C Maury (1SE II).
Why one: Sorry, they've never had a
blanket ban. Specific 'battles' have been
banned in the past, but only if it was felt
that they were becoming boring and/or
lapsing into personal insults. So tough.
(Besides, it's not just Ath vs El-Kholy...)
Why two: The mysterious 'CNS' is my
fault, caused by stress- related mental
regression (as well as just being thick).
And by the way, all the information
contained in the 'Stop Press' was taken
from the BBC world service, and the
quotes used were actual quotes from
reporters at the scene. It was pointed out
that the Pentagon denied any reports of
chemical weapons ten minutes after the
statement which was quoted in the article.
But why do you believe them?
Why three: You really should tell Ben
Turner this, not us. But the machines are
much more modern, I played pool the
other day with no problems from the
machines, and the pinball is being
changed.
A l i e n Sex Fiend
God's Right Hand
Dear Athena,
In the last edition of F E L I X you
expressed a desire for a reply from so-
called 'eternal life' religions (point 5).
As a 'born again' Christian (is there any
other kind?) I can pass on to you what
God has given to the world in the Bible
and pray that its truth cuts deep into the
hearts of people who really desire to
know how to fill the emptyness inside
them.
God's way to heaven and eternal life is
not by being a really nice person only. In
Ephesians 2vv8 & 9 we read:
'For it is by grace you have been
saved, through faith—and this not from
yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by
works, so that no one can boast.'
What's this guy on about, you ask?
Faith in what? Romans 3v22:
'This righteousness from G o d comes
through faith in Jesus Christ to all who
believe...for all have sinned and fall short
of the glory of God and are justified
freely by his grace through the
redemption that came by Christ Jesus.'
So w h y is this Jesus bloke anything
special? John 14v9:
'Anyone w h o has seen me has seen the
Father.' John 14v6: 'Jesus answered, T am
the way, the truth and the life. No one
comes to the Father except through me.'
In other words, we're guilty of
disobedience of God's instructions (sin)
and that separates us from H i m , however
had we tried to pull ourselves out of this
hole we've dug for ourselves. But then
He gives us a way out! He sends His only
son, Jesus Christ, into human existence
and being G o d and perfect in every way
He is the only way that the penalty for
our disobedience can be paid for us, by
sacrificing himself and being cut-off from
the Father, carrying the weight of our
sins. But, through this act, Jesus has
conquered death, rising on the third day
and showing that the kingdom of God
had arrived and Satan is fighting a lost
battle. Now that's what I call real love!
No longer separated but adopted into
His family forever. Then comes those
fantastic promises—'This righteousness...to
