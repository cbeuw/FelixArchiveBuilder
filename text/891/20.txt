Editorial
Another week, and I'm almost beginning
to get used to this. The hardest part (no,
I'm not going to use the same joke I've
used for the last two weeks) is deciding
how to start. Once that's over with, it's
easy. So, here we go...
VICTORY!!! (Provisionally)
Yes, it looks like we've done it! In an
uncharacteristic burst of sanity the
W o r k i n g Party on the College Day have
decided that the 'jolly sensible really'
proposals to alter the length of the day
weren't quite so sensible after all.
According to E l Presidente (Shan), the
decision was apparently made due to the
'...strength of student opinion...' and that
the departments of College (not just
academic ones) which had been keen on
the idea hadn't justified w h y they were.
(Interesting, eh?).
The W o r k i n g Party report to the Board
of Studies, and are thus drafting a paper
which contains their findings (apparently
there were some) and a list of the pros
and cons associated with the proposals.
Shan told me the list of cons would be,
well, rather long, to say the least, w h i c h I
must say comes as a huge surprise to
me...
Unfortunately, the next meeting of the
BoS is too soon for the paper to have
been completed, so a letter will be sent in
the interim, expressing the W o r k i n g
Parties view that 'We strongly
recommend that no changes are made to
the College day for the foreseeable
future.'. This will be followed by the
paper at the first meeting next term.
A l l is not sunshine and roses in happy
bunny land, however. The W o r k i n g
Party, being a committee, has no power
in itself: It acts as an advisor to the BoS.
The BoS, though, has no power either
(it's a committee), so it advises His
Rectorness. He then makes the decision,
as He's got power (He's the Rector, you
see).
Right, what this means is that at any
stage along the way the advice of the
W o r k i n g Party could be ignored. Aren't
bureaucracies a good idea. Of course, this
would be slightly more m a d than M a d
Jack M c M a d , winner of last years
Maddest M a n in Britain competition. But...
Also, the College's interpretation of the
phrase '...for the foreseeable future.' is
about three years, which as a pure
coincidence happens to be just enough
time for most of the current student
population to have left. The words
'sneaky', 'clever', and 'sly', while being on
m y m i n d at the moment, have no bearing
on m y opinion of this. Honest.
But, all that aside, it's still a victory for
us as students. It shows that if we can
rise above the rabid apathy that appears
to be an inherent part of IC, then we can
change things. It might also show College
that they can't do what the hell they like,
without considering what w e think about
it.
Who?
The 'Real M a n ' saga continues. I have
received the letter from Angus Fraser
that I mentioned last week, but
unfortunately he clearly m a r k e d the
envelope as 'confidential' and the letter
itself as 'Personal'. In English, this means
that it would be a bit off for me to print
it without his permission. Suffice it to say
that it expressed, quite strongly, a similar
view to that expressed in last week's
letters page. But tough, I still stand by m y
views as expressed last week.
This week's letters page has held these
views up, especially m y feeling that
contrary to the opinions expressed in last
week's letters page, ie that the 'real m a n '
letter could not 'enhance or enliven' Felix
in any way, i n fact it could. E.g. the two
letters from ' A Real Woman', w h i c h are
from two separate people, by the way.
However, this is not what I want to talk
about. It's just that these letters have
brought to light an interesting
phenomena (he says, sounding like a
scientist for the first time in his life): H o w
people assume the sex of a person from
their opinions. For example, most people
have assumed that the 'Real M a n ' letter
was written by a man. Most people who
have read the 'Real W o m a n ' letters have
assumed they were from a woman. A l a n
'my favourite person in the whole
universe, and I really do think his view
points are so sensible' Bailey assumed
that 'Pendragon' was a w o m a n (he's a
man - A d a m Tinworth, the Arts Editor, in
fact). Several people have held varying
opinions as to the gender of 'Athena'.
Religion, God, etc
What are these guys/gals on? While I try
hard to respect and understand the
opinions or beliefs of others, the amount
of letters we've had from various
Christians has taken it's toll.
A s far as I'm concerned, if someone
wants to accept that by believing in a
semi-mythical figure from the past of the
Middle East, then their souls will be
redeemed, that's fine by me. It gives
people strength and hope, and allows
them an external figure to turn to for
these. A l l well and good. But really, when
they act as if they're beyond criticism,
that they're always right, and that
everyone w h o doesn't believe is either
(a) W r o n g
(b) Mislead
(c) Immoral
(d) Evil
(e) In need of converting
Or any combination of the above, that
it really starts to get on m y nerves. A
belief is yours. No matter how many
people also share your belief, it doesn't
mean that everyone should. It also
A

F

doesn't mean it's 'right'. Specific moral
judgments of 'right' and 'wrong' only exist
within the framework of a specific set of
moral values. Each and every person has
their o w n set, dictated by a huge number
of factors. Each human society has its
o w n set, in the from of both laws and
'unwritten rules'. Each religion has its
o w n set.
This is all fine by me. Just don't start
assuming that everybody should live by
yours. A n d for whoevers sake, don't use
the Bible as if it were fact: It's just a
book! If you believe it's true, fine. But
you can't use it as the basis of an
argument with someone w h o doesn't
believe it's true, when you can't prove it
is. In the same situation, y o u can't judge
somebody by it. Some 'morals' have to be
accepted by everybody: Laws. This is
necessary for our society to function in
the manner w h i c h it does, and to
maintain it. If you don't agree with them,
fine, but you'll suffer the consequences.
Outside this, it's up to you.
Carrie Miller: If you want to see
abortion as w r o n g due to your religious
belief, that's up to you. However, the fact
is that some people will not share your
belief, and the practical fact is that
women will always have abortions. If
your religion leads you to think that
abortion should be banned, and thus that
women who wish one should have to go
to a potentially unqualified person and
risk the consequences, then maybe you
should rethink your concepts of mercy
and compassion (which Christians seem
fond to extol).
David Fernandez-Arias: If Athena
wishes to question your moral
framework, a n d you can't answer his/her
questions, then don't write in telling
Athena that all he/she has to do is
become a Christian and he/she won't
worry about it anymore. Please.
So if you don't have a constructive
point to make (ie not 'God is really cool'
or 'I'm right 'cos I believe' or 'This is
immoral because m y religion tells me so')
I really don't want to hear about it. Sorry.
