Not Again...
Dear Andy,
Okay, so I feel challenged (or
provoked?) to put pen to paper in
response to the second half of Athena's
letter (who is Athena anyway? Doesn't
(s)he have the courage to admit to
his/her own views?) and more specifically
to the rantings against the 'God Squad
Guys' who wrote against abortion. I
would like to put the record straight, and
' say that it isn't just 'guys' who are against
abortion, I am one of m a n y women who
also believe that abortion is murder and
hence very wrong.
'But what would you do if you got
pregnant?' I hear you ask. M y answer is
that you don't even have to run the
slightest risk of getting pregnant before
you are ready. A n d that's without using
contraceptives or being frigid. Society has
reduced the value of sex. It's fashionable
and almost expected of you to sleep with
someone (or even several people), in fact,
if you're still a virgin, people begin to
wonder what planet you've come from.
Sex has even been reduced to be used as
an abusive swear word. Where's the
respect gone for one of life's greatest
pleasures? It's too easy to 'get laid', and
then it's too easy to dispose of the
'evidence'. Y o u know the saying, 'easy
come, easy go'.
But I believe that God has created each
one of us and so, following through with
that argument, I believe that it is His will
if a tiny sperm impregnates a tiny egg,
Who? Part 3
Dear Andy,
Concerning 'A Real M a n ' article Issue
889.
Phoarr! Give him to me, the man of my
dreams: A Real Man! I mean come on
girlies, we'd all love a quick shag with an
IC pisshead, especially when he says he
loves you!
Y o u get the scenario; a generous five
seconds of foreplay and he's desperately
trying to get into your knickers. 'I love
you', he dribbles into your ear and of
course you would believe him!
Meanwhile, your previously immovable
501 buttons mysteriously come undone.
Y o u would have no hassle with me
when it comes to putting rubber socks on
your knob. I'd never consider
inconveniencing a Real M a n with the
burden of a condom, he must be hung
like a donkey if he splits condoms,
afterall they wouldn't split for any other
reason would they?
And it's okay, you wouldn't catch any
nasty diseases from me lovey, the last 23
guys I've bonked swore they were clean
(clean willies, hair...?) and of course I
believed them. (Well I am an easy, dopey
bitch after all and my sincere apologies,
liberated as well!).
starting up the reproductive course. This
means that every baby that is conceived,
God has created, so who are we to take
away their lives.
Then there's the argument of 'what if
you're raped?'. M y answer is that, if only
we ask H i m , G o d will give us the courage
to go through with the birth, and then, if
necessary, offer him/her up for adoption.
Two wrongs don't make a right. It is far
easier to live with nine months of shame,
and be able to hand over a beautiful
living baby, than to hand over a dead
one and live with years of guilt and
shame.
I know that many women don't have
the faith (and courage?) that I have, and
so I am not preaching cold heartedly at
them, to make them change their views.
But I am concerned that sometimes they
are offered no alternative to abortion. I
have heard of several incidences where
women have gone to the health centre
here in College and have been counselled
only for abortion with no offer of help or
advice to pursue the alternatives. Then
after their abortions, they have been
abandoned by the NHS. Leaving some
very desperate and emotionally
vulnerable w o m e n to search for help and
support from people like the Samaratans
or the church. So much for respecting
women and their rights, eh?
Yours,
Carrie Miller, Mech Eng 2.
I'm not very fashion conscious either,
so you're in luck because I'm on the pill,
but you'll have to excuse the fact I'm
three stone overweight, frequently
nauseous, jaundiced and tired all the time
because I haven't found a pill my body
can handle yet.
So what about it Real Man, why don't
you and me get together, you can use me
and reject me in the morning. That is if
you privilege me with a shag, well it's a
man's 'God given right' to shag and I
suppose I should be thankfull for anything
I can get (i.e. a considerate pisshead,
overendowed with tallywacker and a
wonderful sense of humour).
Yours,
A Real Woman.
P.S. It's strange how some people can't
seem to understand different people don't
find the same things amusing. Surprisingly
enough opinions differ and who's to say
who's wrong. Afterall some people found
the Real Man letter funny, some people
found it offensive and I found the man of
my dreams!!
Err... Deja vu?
