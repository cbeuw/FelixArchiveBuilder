Who? Pt.2
Dear Andy,
The men at IC think they've got it hard
but it all looks pretty limp to me. Y o u see
A n d y , when you've had a hard day at
college and y o u fancy a couple of bevvies
with the girls, you discover you've got no
money on you so you have to pick up
some poor ugly bastard (not a problem at
IC) to buy you enough drinks to put up
with the shag he expects in return.
So there he is, pissed as a newt (but not
half as good looking) and desperate to get
his end away so he can brag to his mates
the next day and prove that he's not a
closet homo after all (which is nothing
compared to the laugh us girls will have
when I tell them how crap he was in
bed). He's too fucking stupid to know
how to put a condom, so, to get it over
and done with a.s.a.p. you give him a
hand. If he can get it up and doesn't
Wind Up
Dear Sir,
Pendragon failed to answer m y question
in her reply last week.
W h y subsidise the arts and no other
leisure activity?
Another quite interesting point it raised
is from the quote '...the only reason that
big companies need subsidising is that too
many people are unwilling to try
something different.'
Quite clearly this means that people
don't want to go and watch this stuff.
cont.
all who believe'! A n d it's a free gift!
The beauty of it is that once we accept
this free gift, G o d gives us a bit of
Himself for good (as a kind of guarantee
of what is to come) and the Holy Spirit,
who regenerates our being and hence we
are 'born-again' in the Spirit.
What's more, the Holy Spirit is a
'counsellor' that teaches us, encourages us
and empowers us as we begin to become
more and more like the people God
intended us to be and then we do good
works anyway because of our life for God
and our lives start to make sense, with
new hope and joy.
I say to you A t h e n a that once that's
sorted out, then you should wonder about
what heaven and hell are like.
Proverbs 19v3 says: 'A man's o w n folly
ruins his life yet his heart rages against
the Lord.'â€”think about it!
With my love and prayers,
David Fernandez-Arias.
come before he's shoved it in you've got
to put up with 10 seconds of pumping
and grinding, huffing and puffing, before
he pulls out and asks you if you've come
and falls asleep before you even lie.
Then you look down at his limp prick
which looks like a slimey dwarf in a giant
dustbin liner and the fucking condom's
burst (not surprising where he was
shoving it - dozy bastard!). Three months
later you find yourself up the twig. Y o u
don't want to have the bastard's bastard
but you get some loony from the God
squad (male) telling you not to get it
sucked and he won't take ' F * * k O F F ! ' for
an answer.
Yes, I agree with you M r 'Real Man',
British standards really are dropping.
A real woman.
Mmmmm....

W h y not put plays and musicals on that
people want to watch, w h i c h are popular?
Lloyd-Webber doesn't get a subsidy yet
he has no problem in filling theatres. It is
simple supply and demand economics. I
have nothing against the arts, all I say is
if they are so good then they wouldn't
need a subsidy, would they?
Apart from the arts, public schoolboys
and Iraqis, the other thing that pisses me
off are Vegetarians and Antivivisectionists.
Firstly the veggies. These bunch of
weirdos are supposed to be healthier than
us meat eaters. Yet have you ever seen a
more miserable ill looking shower? These
people are so stupid that when they eat
vegetables they are probably committing
cannibalism. Well I couldn't survive
without a meat pie or hamburger at least
once a day.
As for the antivivisectionists this lot
don't give a toss about people. A l l they
care about is animals.
Well I won't use any shampoo unless I
have a guarantee that it has been
throroughly dripped into the eyes of
some bunny wunny. By the way
Pendragon used the word bigoted (again)
to attack me. This just goes to prove that
m y critics are to originality what Ethiopia
is to catering.
Yours,
Alan Bailey.
Alan, how would you feel about
participating in a public debate centering
on the issues you have raised in the
above and previous letters? Call us at
Felix (3515). Oh, and by the way, have a
look at the reply to Jonathan Barkers
