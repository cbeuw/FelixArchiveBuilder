F o o d , f o o d , glorious food!
IC is situated in the heart of London's entertainment world.
Within a mere ten pence bus ride of College exists every
possible form of entertainment; films, strip-shows, discos,
women's colleges, plays and food. The variety provided by the
latter is endless and a three year systematic attack on it is
well within the pocket of any student. This "tour de cuisine"
can and should turn the "fish fingers * • ' peas merchant" into
an "international" gastronome.
Genuine alternatives
Y o u have or w i l l at some stage tackle and suffer(?) the
delights (sic?) thrown up by the C o l l e g e refectories (ie Mooney's).
Y o u may be wondering if there are any genuine alternatives, to
Mooney, in price and distance from C o l l e g e . Well there are!!
And not a million miles from here either, to quote a past
president of the U n i o n .
The Stockpot (10 minutes w a l k from Southside) in B a s i l
Street (behind Knightsbridge tube), provides the competition.
A typical main course costs between 33p — 65p and includes
chips and one other vegetable. C h i c k e n c a s s e r o l e at 60p i s a
good value for money d i s h . F o r the " r e a l " student Curried
Eggs at 35p i s more reasonable and Spaghetti Bolognese at 33p
(without vegetables) knocks spots off Mooney. T h e quality at
the Stockpot can be judged by its executive c l i e n t e l e . There
is a wide range of deserts but unless you're pretty starved we
would suggest you lay off them since they are slightly o n the
expensive side (18p plus). T h e Stockpot is shut on Sundays,
but open on weekdays t i l l 10pm.
G
o
o
d 55p filler
A l s o in the same price 'bracket are the C h e l s e a K i t c h e n
(which serves huge helpings of salad); The New Hotpot (near
The B o l t o n s , a p u b frequented by gays); Hotpot (good for
moussaka), a good filler f o r 55p; T h e P o t with its quite,
unrushed atmosphere; and the G o l d e n P o t . Incidentally, a l l
the pots are o n or off E a r l ' s Court R o a d . One of the main
features of these places i s the q u i c k n e s s of s e r v i c e . F o r £1
you get a satisfying three course m e a l .
Distinctive Disaster
F o r about £1.50 y o u can get bloated o n a quarter pound
hamburger and c h i p s plus a tray of d e l i c i o u s relish and a milk
shake. G A D (the Great A m e r i c a n Disaster) the most d i s t i n c t i v e
of the group i n Beauchamp P l a c e i s the best. It serves a c o o l ,
thick and refreshing milkshake and w h i l s t waiting for your meal
you can peruse past front pages of The New York T i m e s recount-
ing such epic tales a s the Lindberg c r o s s i n g , the T i t a n i c and
World War two.
The Great American Success (GAS) (on H i g h Street K e n
opposite the tube station) with its hotpanted waitresses i s
open a l l night. Strikes (the nearest one i s i n Gloucester R o a d
near Waitrose) and the Great B r i t i s h S u c c e s s (GBS) are the
poor brother and expensive ripp-off relations of G A D respectively.
T h e nearest G B S i s a l s o i n Gloucester Road opposite the tuber
station. The latest taped A m e r i c a n imports (records you fools)
,are used as background music i n all these joints.
Hot V mild
Those with a robust constitution and a n adventurous taste
can sample a wide variety of A s i a n food at a modest price w i t h i n
the locality. Our favourite hideout i s a B a n g l e d i s h restaurant
c a l l e d the Curry P a l a c e i n Gloucester Road. The papadom, a
giant crsip to be sprinkled with paprika helps to while away the
time t i l l your meal arrives. Bhoonakeema is the best mild
meat d i s h whereas meat vindaloo is the best hot curry they
do. Don't miss one of their vegetable d i s h e s , i n particular,
mushrooms and a l s o the onion bhagee. Try and avoid the mango
chutney when the r e l i s h tray is brought round-you could be i n
for a loo-bound day! Get p a l l y with the waiters for big helpings!
The decor i s p l a i n , simple and reflects the country of origin. A
foreign speciality to this restaurant is the strong German
Dortmunder B i e r .
Other restaurants in the Curry P a l a c e league (£2—£3) are the
H u s s e i n in South K e n for A r a b d i s h e s ; the Soraya opposite T h e
Gloucester public house and a T u r k i s h kebab house opposite
John Menzies i n Old Brompton R o a d . Unfortunately, and to our
great regret, there are no C h i n e s e restaurants i n this price
price bracket; there is however, a Vietnamese restaurant at the
"north e n d of Gloucester Road. Most of these restaurants do
takeaways.
Franco-Italian artistry
At £2.50—£4.00, including house carafe wine, e x i s t s a n
extensive range of French and Italian restaurants ( B i s t r o s ,
B i s t i n g o s , etc) dotted a l l over South K e n and the surrounding
areas. T h e s e provide the artistry associated with F r a n c o -
Italian food and more often than not in a pleasant atmosphere.
There i s little between these; explore them and find the one
that suits your taste.
Luscious trout
The 13'/2 Cantina Marchigiana is at 13 Beauchamp P l a c e .
P r i c e - w i s e it is slotted between the Bristros and the up market
restaurants. A cosy little one-roomed family outfit, the 13l
/2 has
a distinctive character. T h e food cooked by the mother i s
served by the father, his son and a couple of waiters. A v o c a d o s
with prawns, l'escargot a u gratin, melon, cannelloni and other
pasta dishes are just a few choice selections from their extensive
entree l i s t . Sumptious, mouth-watering trout bathed i n a house
white wine, mushroom sauce and to be drunk with the same vino
is an unforgetable experience of e c s t a c y .
The Mediteranean flavour of the decor i s portrayed by both
the Italian wine bottles on a l l sides of the room and the Italian
family spirit. T h e quite background music is conducive to
stimulating conversation/This atmosphere is ideal for developing
an acquaintance.
T a k e your time over choosing a main course - the waiters
take delight in explaining the differences between the various
courses. T h e truly great dishes are those served under the
house name. T h i s i s a l s o true of the deserts e s p e c i a l l y crepe
marchigiana, which is a pancake f i l l e d with fresh cream and a
dash of liquer. If by this time your not w e l l and truly satiated,
then try one of their gateauxs from the trolley (De Tartare
says you're a better man than he). T h i s feast, not to be scorned
even by a king, w i l l only set you back £3.50 a head and includes
carafe wine.
Seduction
The expensive meal for those s p e c i a l o c c a s i o n s must have
the restaurant carefully c h o s e n . It must appeal to the character
of the people being entertained, particularly in the atmosphere
they provide. F o r a boisterous evening try the Bortchsh ' n ' T e a r s
in Beauchamp P l a c e . L e C h a l e t i n Campden H i l l Road off H i g h
Street K e n is the perfect setting for a n evening of seduction.
(Come equipped with a thick wallet and make sure you're o n to
a certainty before you set out.)
Unsavoury, but..,
B a c k to the basic requirements of a hungrey student, we
note but do not recommend the following unsavoury e s t a b l i s h -
ments, the P i z z a l a n d s , Wimpys and K e n t u c k y s . Takeaway
doner kebab are substantially better value for money and tastier.
During the coming year w e intend frequenting various eating
houses including several of those already mentioned and
commenting on each one i n F E L I X at regular intervals. We
welcome any suggestions a n d comments o n any restaurants
you may come a c r o s s . Here's to wine, women and song.
