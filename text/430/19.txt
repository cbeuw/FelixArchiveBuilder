IC help England scrape
a victory
England 2 v Imperial C o l l e g e 1
On Sunday Imperial C o l l e g e
once again served a s sparring
p a r t n e f s f o r D o n R e v i e ' s England
team, in preparation for their
match against F i n l a n d on
Wednesday. In a splendid
matchIC performed magnificently
and despite world c l a s s oppos-
ition were only defeated by a
single goal.
Injuries
Since the England squad
was severely hit by injuries,
they could field only nine men
for this match and in order to
complete the eleven I C ' s P a t
Frampton a n d Welshman (!)
Gareth Roberts made their
England debuts. K e v A l l e n
and Dave F i n n i s a l s o w o n their
first caps by sharing the
responsibility of keeping
goal for D o n R e v i e ' s team.
In goal for IC w a s a promising
youngster by the name of
Peter Shilton, w h o , despite
his obvious nerves i n the
early stages, settled down and
had a fine game.
Controversial
P l a y w a s very even through-
out the first half and despite
Frampton hitting the cross bar
IC prevented England from
getting any clear cut c h a n c e s .
However, mid-way through
the first half Mick M i l l s w a s
put through by a long pass and
shot past the advancing Shilton
to put England one up. Never-
t h e l e s s , IC came back into the
game and nearly equalized
when a Steve B a t e s drive w a s
well saved by K e v A l l e n . A
few minutes before half time
England scored their s e c o n d ,
somewhat controversial g o a l .
Gordon H i l l worked a beautiful
one-two with Charlie George
and, although looking sus-
p i c i o u s l y offside, slammed
the ball into the back of the
net.
IC determination pays off
So IC began the second half
two goals down but they
continued to play with great
determination, and by sheer
hard work refused to w i l t under
pressure. In fact, I C themselves
began to look dangerous with
some neat passing in midfield
which brought about some good
breakaway attacks. T h e n , in
the last minute, IC finally got
the goal they deserved. T h e
ball w a s centred from a corner
k i c k , P a u l Heidn shot and
F i n n i s parried it, he shot
again and the b a l l rebounded
off the post, eventually Heidn
shot for a third time and the
ball flew into the back of the
net, 2â€”1. The final whistle
went before England could
restart the game and s o ended
a pulsating match i n which IC
put up a splendid, all-round
team performance which is
fully reflected in the s c o r e - l i n e .
