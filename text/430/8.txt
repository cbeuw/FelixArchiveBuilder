W CAPITAL RADIO 95.8 KHz UHF
C a p i t a l Radio i s L o n d o n ' s twenty-four
hour Commercial radio station. Celebrating
its third birthday at 5am on Sunday,
C a p i t a l h a s , in this short time, grown
into a force surpassed by no other
commercial radio station i n B r i t a i n .
With a programme b a s i s of good m u s i c ,
competitions and phone-ins it might
seem to be just like the rest but the
quality of i t s presenters lift it to
greater heights. N o second-division
station could employ — a n d keep the
services of the l i k e s of Gerald Harper,
Michael A s p e l , Dave C a s h , or the loon
himself, " C u d d l y " Kenny Everett.
But these household names are only
part of the hard-working family of
presenters that make up C a p i t a L
The person who h a s the greatest
number of hours a week i s Roger Scott,
presenter of the ' D a i l y Slot' from three
in the afternoon through to seven in the
evening. He a l s o hosts the C a p i t a l
Countdown, C a p i t a l ' s own singles
chart, on Saturday mornings from nine t i l l
noon.
His twenty-three hours a week
cinema may seem e x c e s s i v e but there
have been no complaints from listeners
or from Roger. Certainly the variety
therein i s enough to keep the most
discerning listener happy. Despite h i s
mammoth s c h e d u l e , mammoth indeed by
B r i t i s h radio standards that i s , Roger
is s t i l l able to spare some time to
talk to F E L I X about C a p i t a l .
E s s e n t i a l l y Roger's own weekday
programme has to cater for most music
tastes because of its time span, and the
consequential mixture of listeners.
About a year ago C a p i t a l decided to
rearrange early evening programmes and
before this change Roger finished at
6pm. 'The basic change was just to
extend my programme from six to seven
o'clock. They used to have the news
package at six o'clock, but came to
realise that it was too early, and that

four months of this year, without mention-
ing a n alternative figure). They have
received support from Canadian radio
interests a n d are allowed considerable
flexibility by the I B A who are loath to
see the station fail due to its news
service forthe other stations. Unfortunately
'their programmes now show definite
signs of tight finances. T h i s v i c i o u s
circle could well be unbreakable.
LBC aloof, but needs support
Whilst 1 have visited the station in the
past, L B C d i d not seem to consider
F E L D C important enough to allow a
v i s i t and a n interview, which could have
allowed them to put their present position
forward. Maybe F E L D C i s not the D a i l y
Mirror (thank goodness! - E d ) but L B C
would seem to reel a l l the support that
they can get at present.
there were too many people driving
home at that time of evening who would
rather hear music for another hour. So,
basically, my bit of the shift was
stretched out a bit'.
So Roger inherited a n extra five
hours per week. However h i s timeslot i s
more like a number o f different shows
rather than one four-hour bundle.
Changing Emphasis
'It changes as you feel the audience
change. At three o'clock it's oldies
the Three O'clock Thrill — because the
kids are at school for a start; then at
four, four thirty you get into things that
are gonna interest them (the kids) like
the Top Ten and the People's Choice.'
(A chance for the listener to vote for
one of two brand new records that Roger
has c h o s e n , from Monday to Thursday,
with the four winners battling it out i n
the P e o p l e ' s C h o i c e final on F r i d a y .
The winning single i s the one that
gets the most phone-in votes, a n d it
becomes the P e o p l e ' s C h o i c e ; ie Record
of the Week — for the forthcoming week.)
'So it is just changing it (the program-
me) and adjusting it as your audience is
changing. Then at six o'clock, six to
seven it gets a bit loose and you can
have a little more freedom because the
mums and dads all sit goggling in front
of the box anyway.So you can practically
write them off; the people left listening
at the time are a little bit more involved-
in the music so you can lend to take a
few more liberties with the play list.'
Playlist
The play list is the magic word around
radio stations. It i s the list of records,
predominantly s i n g l e s , that make up the
station's standard music composition for
the week. A l l records on the playlist
should, in theory, have a n equal number
of p l a y s per week.
A record outside the p l a y l i s t i s
unlikely to receive much a i r time, i f a n y ,
on the 'pop' music programmes. C a p i t a l ' s
p l a y l i s t i s decided at weekly meetings
w h i c h are chaired by the music director,
A i d a n D a y , a n d which enable most of the
presenters to have their s a y in the
matter. With the playlist in operation
Roger Scott, for instance, would walk
into the studio a n d , depending on the
feel of the programme, would pick out a
record near the front of the various
sections — the ones at the back being
records just played — so that there i s no
set d i s c order or set times that a certain
record should be p l a y e d .
In fact he h a s virtually complete
freedom of choice within the p l a y l i s t ,
but 'even though there might be 'a
specific record on the playlist that you
hate you don't avoid that record because
you know that ther's gonna be hundreds
and thousands of people out there who
are gonna love it when you put it on.'
In point of fact Roger h a s 10 to 15 per
cent of the programme material left
entirely up to h i m .
On the subject of C a p i t a l ' s future
Roger had this to s a y : 'Capital wants to
consolidate and always change. I think
you must always keep changing. If you
stay the same then you get stale and
don't progress at all.It's a very dangerous
situation that we are in really; being as
successful as we have become in the
three years it is very easy to get com-
placent about it — sort of sit back and
say " w e l l aren't we g o o d ? " and " h a v e n ' t
we done w e l l ? " . If you do that then it's
the beginning of the end, se we don't do
that, we don't realty think about that. We
are always thinking about how we can
change it, how we can improve it and
things we can do, like the Helpline
thing that we started. Things like that
which aren't gimmicks and they aren't
things that are going to gain us an
enormous audience. They are not flashy
things to do, but things like that they
help us get more involved and more
into the community. It's things like that,
now that we apparently have this large
audience, that enable us to consolidate
the audience figures, so that they (the
listeners) are there just because they're
going to hear records they want to
hear but because there are other things
going on as well.'
The weekly review of C a p i t a l ' s
situation ensures that it provides a
service that y o u , the listener, require.
So much s o , that C a p i t a l could s t i l l be
around i n 2167 — think about it.
Radio London
The true
local'
station
" R a d i o London is L o n d o n ' s only l o c a l
radio s t a t i o n " — the confident words of
A l a n Holden i t s station manager. 1
recently went along to R a d i o London to
see how they put together nearly eighteen
hours cf programmes a d a y .
Radio London i s a comparatively new
B B C l o c a l station which opened, on V H F
in 1970. With the decision to put l o c a l
radio onto medium wave in 1972, Radio
L o n d o n a l s o went out on 206 metres, a
difficult wavelength to get a good
coverage but one which does at least
a l l o w R a d i o London to reach a far wider
audience than o n V H F . It i s B B C policy
that a l l their l o c a l stations are completely
independant from the B B C e d i t i o n a l l y .
