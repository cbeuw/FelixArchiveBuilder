Watte**:
It m
a
y now seem a long w a y behind
u s , but I'd like t o make a few comments
on the Freshers F a i r of last T u e s d a y .
Generally, I w a s very impressed by the
organisation of the s t a l l s and the
efficient way in which people cleared up
afterwards and returned the hired tables —
there were only a few exceptions.
It w a s inevitable that some s o c i e t i e s
(would turn up within the last 48 hours
and request a s t a l l , perhaps because
the previous year's committee had
forgotten to d o s o . A few s o c i e t i e s put
up posters and signs with ' s e l l o t a p e ' ,
but most were more considerate.
Publicity rules OK?
On the subject of publicity, the
publicity rules are a v a i l a b l e from
Chalky; and the House Committee may
have one of their periodic purges on
" i l l e g a l " (eg out of date) posters in the
near future (hint!).
Freshers F a i r w a s a very impressive
sight. I could not estimate the number of
students milling around. It w a s rather
unfortunate that the afternoon w a s wet
and windy, e s p e c i a l l y s i n c e this
prevented the hot a i r balloon being
inflated in the quadrangle. But I hope
that a good time was had by a l l .
I can't get into my office
A l l is going well in the Union at
present, despite the fact that I am
almost unable to get into or out of my
office due to the students laying siege to
Pam a n d J e n for discount cards a n d
room bookings respectively — not * to
mention Union cards being authorised!

Mike dinner.
Those of you who were at the Union
meeting last week (you were there,
weren't you?) w i l l remember, if (a) y o u
were awake and (b) y o u knew what w a s
going o n , (which I d i d not most of the
time), that I mentioned two items concern-
ing the U n i o n ' s mascot in my report.
The mascot, 'Mike', i s the totem or
rallying point, if you like, for the body
of students at I C . After d i s c u s s i o n s
with a number of people, including some
who have had Mike in their personal
care in previous years, I suggested that
Mike be secured to a wall in the Union
Bar where the mascot c a n be seen by
all IC students and their guests, but
not stolen by rival c o l l e g e s . I hope that
I shall receive suggestions from many
members of the Union regarding this
project.
Secondly, on November 3rd we are to
celebrate the 10th Birthday of our mascot,
and to this purpose I am arranging a
' s m a l l ' dinner in the Union Dining H a l l .
T h i s w i l l involve lightening your wallets
and purses by £5.00, (don't cringe too
much, some people have already paid!),
cheques made payable to Imperial
College U n i o n . T h e dinner is slightly
more expensive than the Freshers
Dinners s i n c e the Union does not s u b s i d i s e
dinners — Freshers Dinners are s u b s i d i s e d
by the department.
One last world - please ensure that
you are carrying your Union cards in the
Union building, and that guests w h o do
not have cards under r e c i p r o c a l agreements
are signed into the guest book in the
Union bar (another hint!).
After two weeks of IC y o u should a l l
now be in a fit state for certification of
insanity. P e r s o n a l l y , the clutch on my
brain is s l i p p i n g ; however, spare parts
and my headshinker permitting, back into
top gear and off w i t h —
Crash Pad
After having run for three weeks,
the Crash P a d is c l o s i n g after tonight's
' s e s s i o n ' . There a r e , at the time of
writing, about half a dozen second and
third years s t i l l using the scheme. How-
ever, it h a s been decided to c l o s e the
scheme s i n c e it appears that a l l first
year students now have somewhere to
live — the criterion being that second
and third year students a r e , generally,
better equipped to deal with finding
someones floor to crash upon than a
first year, who may not know a soul in
C o l l e g e . I would like to s a y a s p e c i a l
thankyou to John Mellors and R o s s
Darling w h o both gave up a great deal
in order to man the scheme s i n c e its
inception, a l s o to Dave Knights who
helped out in the transition period from
the Temporary Rooms Scheme over into
the Crash P a d Scheme.

IC Union Hon.Sec
I have organised further meetings outside
the usual I C U stomping ground for later
in the year; having removed one excuse
w i l l you please now try and come —
give it a chance! .
Other business w i l l include the
elections mentioned earlier and hopefully
a debate a s to whether I C U should
reaffiliate itself to the London Student
Organisation ( L S O ) — bearing in mind
that this affiliation costs the Union
about £500 of your money.

The Union Meeting of the Thursday
of the first week of term passed the
Changes to the Constitution nem con
(ie when put to the vote, without
contradiction or possition). On bringing
these changes to the next Union Meeting,
on approval of a two-thirds majority,
these changes w i l l be institued. A s I
explained at the Union Meeting, the
changes I put forward were putting to
paper what w a s generally accepted
verbally, however, I would s t i l l urge
you to come to the next Union Meeting
and consider the changes.
The next U G M •* Thursday 28th
October at 13.00 - w i l l be in Mech E n g
220, not in the Great H a l l a s u s u a l . T h e
venue for this meeting w a s chosen with
a certain maxum in mind, namely, 'if the
Mountain won't come to Mohamed, then
Mohamed must go to the Mountain'.
Parking
The Union Parking Committee h a s met
and made its s e l e c t i o n . If you were one

s u c c e s s f u l applicants on production of
an authorised Union Card and a log
