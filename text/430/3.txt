N the week, as opposed to the usual four.
A The production of F E L I X depends
:
" .."> fundamentally on two machines - an
:>?% offset-litho printing machine, and a
Vfc, varityper, which sets the text y o u are
: \ X now reading. If either of these machines
breaks down, the production of F E L I X i s
severely jeopardised, because, firstly,
*"•'•: both take at least a day to repair, and
jjjjfc. secondly, since the other college printing
units are normally unable to help us (they
are overworked and understaffed, too).
F E L I X i s similarly reliant on the good
health of Ian Morse and G i l l McConway,
our litho operator and varitypist. I h a d
intended that there should be a s p e c i a l
edition of F E L I X last F r i d a y , recording
Now we're back to our regular form and
our usual day of i s s u e - F r i d a y . T h i s
edition i s , i n fact, a little s p e c i a l a s
regards s i z e - don't expect too many
bumper i s s u e s i n the weeks to come.
T w e l v e to sixteen pages wjll probably
be the standard s i z e this year.
I w a s disappointed to hear of N U S ' s
move to force, effectively, I C U to s e l l
the discount cards and handbooks at £ 2 .
I C U were hurting no-one (except N U S
Services) by s e l l i n g the cards at £1.75. A t
£2 the scheme s t i l l represents a bargain.
We hope to give some details of how the
scheme affects yon next week.

Phillips calls for
immigration enquiry
In a speech to Overseas
Students at the C i t y U n i -
versity, Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
N U S V i c e - P r e s i d e n t , Sab-
batical Secretary of the
L S O and ex-President of
I C U , c a l l e d for a public
inquiry into the Immigration
Service as it w a s 'open to
abuse by racists'.
He cited the case of a
Ghanaian student and h i s
wife returning to a London
P o l y t e c h n i c who telephoned
him, informing him that he
had been refused entry at
G a t w i c k , because, according
to immigration, the L E A had
no right to give him a grant.,
T h i s was irrespective of
proof of examination results,
financial support and a letter
requesting registration., Mr
P h i l l i p s managed to s e e the
student after a 'short, sharp,
hostile interview' with the
C h i e f Immigration Officer.
Most of those held at the
" b e e h i v e " were black, and
they claimed they had been
"ordered about and b u l l i e d " .
The student w a s finally
granted entry due to f the
intervention of Judith Hart
M P , but the fate of h i s wife
is still undecided
Trevor P h i l l i p s feels there
' is a need to overhaul the
entire immigration policy' as
d e c i s i o n s left to the d i s c r e t i o n
of immigration officers leaves
'the service open to abuse by
racists'.
He added that ending
immigration is not the answer
as it only heightens tension
and i s really just a n attempt
to divert attention from
B r i t a i n ' s real problems.
BSA A TRUE RIVAL TO NUS?
The s m a l l , incestuous world
of Student politics saw another
outbreak of verbal aggro last
week, with the setting up of a
rival Student's Union to the
N U S . A t a dinner to launch
the founding of the new British
Student Association, Mr L e o
Martin-Brown, one of the
founders of the A s s o c i a t i o n ,
alleged that N U S services
were running at a huge l o s s .
N U S treasurer, C h r i s Morgan
later replied that this w a s
rubbish, a n d implied that Mr
Brown w a s merely starting h i s
organisation i n a fit of pique,
having himself failed three
times to be elected as N U S
treasurer. T h e finances of the
new ' U n i o n ' are however
clouded in mystery. A l l Mr
Brown w i l l say i s that he is
backed by 'private firms i n the
C i t y ' .
Admitting that, at first
sight the B S A appeared to be
offering cheaper travel and
lower subscriptions, Mr Morgan
said T have no doubt at a l l
that it w i l l be another of the
fly-by-night operations which
end up taking students money
and being unable to deliver the
goods'.

A L L U S E A B L E Q U O T E S T O
T H E F E L I X O F F I C E
Union Handbook
Dear S i r — With reference to
the article w h i c h appeared i n
the ' F r e s h e r s ' F E L I X c o n -
cerning the JJnion Handbook
may I make the following
comments.
I d o not w i s h to be drawn
into the argument about the
overtime which had to be
worked to meet the Registry
deadline of the middle of
August, except to say that the
U n i o n were given the same
deadline as everyone e l s e
for submission of their
' F r e s h e r s ' material, a n d to
point out that at least the
Handbook w a s ready to send
to F r e s h e r s this year!
My main concern, however,
is to correct the reason
for the Handbook s t i l l being
in Registry a month after the
completion. Y e s , I w a s on
holiday until the 13 September
and y e s , this does give P A R T
of the explanation, but it
implies that the Registry
goes to s l e e p when I am not
there and nothing could be
further from the truth. Indeed
I sometimes think that the
work o f the Registry goes on
in spite of me and not because
of me. There were many
reasons w h y the F r e s h e r s '
mailing w a s not attended to
in my absence. Not the
least of w h i c h w a s the
considerable amount of work
that w a s being handled i n
the office during this period.
T o my collegues and to
the best staff of any office
i n Imperial may I offer my
apologies if they thought
that the reason given i n
F E L I X implied that " w h i l e
the c a t ' s a w a y , the mice
w i l l p l a y " . p
Yours faithfully,

Covers
Dear Sir, — Congratulations on
a fine issue — I s i n c e r e l y hope
that the full-colour spread h a s
the desired effect on prospective
advertisers.
However, I should like to
draw your attention to the sect-
ion in your E d i t o r i a l which
c l a i m s that the F r e s h e r s D a y
issue i s " . . . t h e first lithoed
U G i s s u e to u s e a colour
c o v e r . " Colour covers for
F E L I X were used e x t e n s i v e l y
i n the s e s s i o n 1974/75. B u t
regardless of that, the first
lithoed colour cover used for
F E L I X w a s , I understand,
i s s u e no. 100 which i s dated
around December 1956.
Yours sincerely
