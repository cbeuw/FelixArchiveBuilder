Wimbledon magic flat
second time round
Rocket Cottage - Steeleye Span
(Chrysalis C H R 1123)
I was rather looking forward to this L P
s i n c e their last effort, (whose title I
can't mention because of the competition)
spanned the void between folk and rock
remarkably w e l l . Produced by Womble
Mike Batt the album w a s excellent and
won them many new friends, although
losing a few old traditionalists, who
felt they'd gone too far with their up-tempo
arrangements.
Now, with Rocket Cottage, Span have
gone too far for even me to rave about.
F o l k devotees have played it too have
been shocked. A t points good lyrics
have been s a c r i f i c e d to a inept commercial
arrangement, at others, such a s Orfeo/
Nathan's Reel the treatment is too
casual and flimsy that I got the feeling
Steeleye were getting insincere about
their music.
My main c r i t i c i s m s must be vented on
'The Twelve Witches' and 'Sir John The
Rose'. The former has a mellatron intro
and interludes that are just too bland for
this sort of music. The latter takes up a
major chunk of the second s i d e . It has
only a twinkling of folk, the rest is
punk rock and commerciality. T h e
excellent lyrics (traditional) .depict a
sad Scottish tale — I wonder if the
Rollers w i l l do a cover version? With a
different producer this may have come
off w e l l ; a s it is it smacks too much of
the. worse end of the hit parade,, the
chorus e s p e c i a l l y .
On the other" hand the vamped up
jig 'Sligo Maid' comes across well
but it won't please traditional folk fans.

However, for my part I felt the commanding
rhythm and enthralling v i o l i n intonnations
held the track together extremely w e l l .
Having got the bodies out the w a y , a
few words on the better s o n g s . My
favourite is 'Fighting for Strangers'
(chorus music 'To Be A Pilgrim') which
a s s e s s e s the motivation behind a
nineteenth century soldier, painting a
rueful picture of the limbless victims of
manmade strife. A very perceptive
treatment indeed. 'The Brown Girl' is
another good number. Its main point is
the strong, versatile and enigmatic vocal
treatment of Moddy Prior, who pounds
literally through this 'love tradgedy'.
Tight instrumental work l e t s you glide
through the s o n g ' s contrasting moods.
Above ordinary and quite enthralling — I
wish there were more tracks like it on the
L P .
Maddy's vocals come over w e l l again
jon the c l o s i n g song, 'The Drunkard', an
all-encompassing traditional folk tune.
I hope by this time their folk fans won't
have given up hope.
Not a d a z z l i n g L P , and certainly not
an appropriate follow-up to their last hit
album. I think that Mike Batt h a s overworn
his usefulness a s producer, although on
the last L P he gave the band some needed
new breath. _ . . _

Frantic funk adds moonshine
lustre to debut effort
Moon - T o o C l o s e For Comfort ( E P I C )
Straight into it then, with Noel
M c C a l l a ' s powerful vocals pumping out
'You better look out stranger...' and the
first Moon album begins to flood the
eardrums. T h e track in question is
'Lone Ranger' and it stomps along like
the proverbial clappers, an uptemp chunk
of funk that bodes well for the rest of the
platter. F o r a relatively new band, who've
been paying their dues in de pubs a n '
c l u b s , this is indeed a distinguished
first spin on the turntable. They work up
a healthy sweat here and there on the
A—side and the combined v e r s a t i l i t y /
imagination M c C a l l a ' s v o c a l s a l w a y s
make for an interesting listen.
The quicker numbers are written by
drummer Luigi Salvoni (now departed) and
Dave Dennis, while the melodic moments,
namely 'Cold Nights' and 'Makin' Love',
are normally supplied courtesy of lead
guitarist L o z Netto. After these charming
little interludes it's back to the raunch
with the title track, and probably the
best bit of butt-shaking on the album.
It builds up steam with a guitar/harmonica
intro reminiscent of war at their best and
chops i t ' s way through five minutes of
frantic frunk, finally bowing out on a
percussive flow.
The second side is a more low-key
affair but quality is in no way s a c r i f i c e d
and it would seem a safe bet to presume
that Moon have c o l l e c t i v e l y spent a lot of
time and thought making sure that their
first release is an effort to be proud of.
The slower the pace, the more
M c C a l l a gets into a song and smooths out
the l y r i c s . A singer with great talent,
h e ' s given plenty of room to experiment
on side two, there being no tracks with
the rush or immediacy of 'Lone Ranger'
o r ' Too Close For Comfort'.
There are few albums released these
d a y s , very few by a new band, of which
it c a n be said there are no duff tracks
present, but this is one. A n a l b u m M o o n
can be well proud of. HIC
