We owe the people w h o a r e new
around c o l l e g e an explanation. Y o u see,
we are the-people who gave you a little
c a r d at the beginning of term s a y i n g :
' N i g h t l i n e , someone to talk to.) and w e
put up posters around c o l l e g e carrying the
same Sort of message. Now it might not
be clear to everybody what there i s to
talk about to this " N i g h t l i n e ' . What is
Nightline anyway? •
Well, w e are a group of students who
think it i s important that there i s a
place around c o l l e g e with a friendly
atmosphere where y o u can come at any
time of the night and talk to another
student about anything, where y o u a r e
not being preached at, and" where every-
thing y o u s a y is kept completely c o n -
fidential.
Do not think that y o u have to be
s u i c i d a l to go to Nightline because that
is simply not true. Although Nightline
started a s a n emergency s e r v i c e , we find
now people in a l l sorts of moods and
with a l l sorts of problems come in or
phone up. Other people just want some
information or a c u p of c o f f e e .
The other thing you might want to know
IB"-what sort of person is a Nightline
volunteer. Well we a r e a l l students, but
that is about the only generalisation y o u
can give about Nightline volunteers.
Volunteers are s e l e c t e d for their ability
to listen and be friendly. The onTy other
thing they have in common i s that'they
w i l l a l l offer you a cup of coffee if you
drop in

Over the summer vacation Nightline
moved from no. 8 P r i n c e s Gardens to no.>
10 P r i n c e s Gardens-, s o when y o u drop
in you might find u s s t i l l in a bit of a
mess. B u t once everything i s ready it
should look very smart.
Volunteers
The last thing I forgot to tel.I you is?
that Nightline h a s got large information
f i l e s about anything y o u might possibly
want information on Doctors, Abortion
c l i n i c s , Accommodation, e t c . ,
I hope that cleared up the picture a
little but if y o u want to know now y o u
are a l w a y s welcome to drop in or phone

— • COLLEGE NOTICES —
The Orienteering Club is one of the
newest college clubs, but already it is
one of the most active. This term, we
will be taking part in Orienteering
Events nearly every Sunday in forests in
the South of England. We usually travel
by minibus, leaving fairly early on
Sunday morning, and getting back about
mid-afternoon.
Orienteering is a sport that should
appeal to anyone with a pair of legs and a
liking for the country-side. There are
always a variety of courses varying in
length between 2 and 8 miles, 'so you can
choose the course you prefer. Whether
you are strolling round, or running round,
it is best to try a short course the first
time and move up as you gain experience.
Navigation just as important as speed
For those who don't yet know what the
sport involves, the idea is to make one's
way round a set' of checkpoints in the
forest in the shortest time using map and
compass. The checkpoints consist of red
and white markers hung on some feature
eg a spur, a path junction^and one chooses
one's own route between them. To do well,
navigation i s just as important as speed.
T o find out more about the sport,
come along to our Friday lunchtime
meetings, held regularly in the Senior
Common Room ( Union First Floor).
At these meetings, a cheap bread and
cheese lunch is provided, and transport
for forthcoming events is arranged.

SECURITY NEWS
The attention of Students, particularly now arrivals to the
College, is drawn to the services provided by the security staff
and students should not hesitate to contact the Security Officer,
Room 763, Sherfield Building, internal telephone number 2741
regarding any security matter and in particular anything con-
cerning the following:-
Lost Property
Every year hundreds of items of personal property are found
and handed In at the Security Office — many such items are never
claimed by the losers and eventually are returned to the finders.
Students and Staff who lose property should promptly inform the
security staff and in many cases the items will be speedily
restored. Persons finding items of personal property should
hand them in to the Security Office or to one of the messengers
or security guards on any of the buildings.
Thefts
It Is an unfortunate fact of life that, on an open campus such
as this where a very large number of people are allowed
considerable freedom of access, periodical spates of stealing
occur. A good deal of this is due to the incursions of 'walk in'
thieves who prey on institutions such as this and on the museums,
several of which are in close proximity to the College. Both
Students and Staff are requested to co-operate with security
staff by promptly reporting to the Security Officer any suspicious
persons seen loitering in college buildings or entering offices or
laboratories with no apparent authority. Wallets, cash, Cheque
books, calculators, slide rules, watches are the things most
commonly stolen and they should never be left in jackets or
brief cases In unattended rooms, in particular, cheque books and
cheque cards should always be carried separately on the person
£S Instances have occurred where heavy withdrawals of cash
Irom banks have been made through thieves having obtained
possession of both card and cheque book.
Pedal cycles are currently very attractive to thieves and it
brought on to the campus they should be secured to the cycle
rack with a heavy chain and stout padlock. Plastic covered
cables of the kind purchased in cycle shops provide little
deterrent to thieves and should not be used. If you value your
cycle please insure it.
Car Parking
Unless you have been authorised to park your car on the
campus do not bring it into the College car park otherwise you
will inconvenience some person who has an authorised parking
place. Derelict vehicles are also'from time to time an embarrass-
ment to the College and any vehicle which ceases to be roao
worthy should be disposed of by the owner and not left on the
car park where it may quickly be cannibalised by persons who
are quick to recognise that it has been abandoned. Motor cycles
brought into the College must be registered with the Security
Officer and Students are requested to park only in the authorised
parking spaces. Parking in between motor vehicles can result in
damage to both cars and motor cycles.
Language classes
Weekly classes in French, German and Russian will be held
throughout the session 1976—77. They are open, free of charge,
to all members of Imperial College and provide for three levels
of attainment:
Elementary — for complete beginners. (Two periods of 1 hour
per week).
Intermediate —for students who have previously completed at
least a year's course in the language. (One period
1^ hours per week).
Advanced —for students who have already followed the
Intermediate course or who have reached a
standard corresponding to an ' O ' level pass.
(One period of IVi hours per week).

Campion in the Associated Studies office (53 Prince's Gate,
