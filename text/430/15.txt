Daydreaming,
in the fourth
conscious state
Transcendental Mediation (TM) was
brought to the West seventeen years ago
by Maharishi Mahesh Y o g i with the aim
of unfolding the full potential of the
individual through the development of a
fourth major state of c o n s c i o u s n e s s . The
three states of c o n s c i o u s n e s s regularly
available are w a k i n g , s l e e p i n g , ..nd
dreaming; each one characterized
objectively by different p h y s i o l o g i c a l
correlates.. Scientific research on T M
as w e l l as subjective experience shows
that a fourth major state of c o n s c i o u s n e s s
is inherent i n our neuro-physiology — a
state of restful alertness; restful because
within a few minutes after starting the
J j H H U H
technique, the body gains a state of
rest that is almost twice as deep as that
of deep sleep, (releasing deep s t r e s s e s
and tensions), while the mind, instead of
falling a s l e e p , actually increases in
alertness and w a k e f u l n e s s . E l e c t r i c
encephalographic research shows an
integration and synchrony of brain wave
activity between different parts of the
brain w h i c h does not occur to such an
extended coherence in the other states
of c o n s c i o u s n e s s . T h e integration gained
during T M , as the meditator experiences
refined l e v e l s of mental a c t i v i t y , carries
on into the day and accumulates over time
to benefit the i n d i v i d u a l . R e s u l t s are:
Increased energy and creative i n t e l l i g e n c e ,
more inner stability, h a p p i n e s s , improved
health, and the full development of the
mind and body in the state of E n l i g h t e n -
ment.
The T M technique is practiced 15/20
minutes twice a day sitting comfortably
in a chair with the eyes c l o s e d . Without
requiring any s pec ia 1 s e tting or preparation,
it is a purely mental technique which
does not necessitate any change in faith,
life s y t l e , or diet; it does not involve asy
concentration, or effort. It is completely
natural, and uses what is already inherent
within us.

Gliding Club
Cheap glide
to success
The club was founded in 1929 as the
gliding movement began to form in
E n g l a n d . During the early thirties the
club lived at Dunstable with the London
G l i d i n g C l u b . After the war the c l u b
reformed at R e d h i l l with the Surrey
G l i d i n g c l u b , and has remained with this
club to the present day. The clubs now
share the f a c i l i t i e s of the L a s h a m G l i d i n g
Society, at L a s h a m A i r f i e l d near B a s i n g -
stoke.
I C G C has 3 single-seat gliders, a K.a
^8 for early solo, a Skylark IV for early
cross-country flying and a new A s t i r C S
for advanced p i l o t s .
Training
The training of our pilots is done by
the L a s h a m Society, initially on motor
gliders moving on to two-seater gliders
when the b a s i c handling techniques have
been learnt.
The c o l l e g e club is a very cheap way
to learn to glide, and a l s o , a s it is a s m a l l
club, a very friendly c l u b . Most students
take about 2 terms to go solo, going
down to Lasham every other weekend.
We have pilots of a l l standards in the
c l u b , including ex-students. In fact the
third position in this year's world
championships standard c l a s s was taken
by George Burton, an ex-student.
If you are interested come a l o n g , t o
Aero Engineering room 254 on any
Thursday at 6 p m .
Judo Club
Ancient art is now fine all-round exercise
Much mystery and confusion surrounds
the sport of judo. The gentle art of
judo was devised in 1882 by Dr Jigoro
Kano, who founded the Kodokan School
In Tokyo. Kano's ideas incorporated
many of the ancient jiu-jitsu techniques,
but his wish was to create a relatively
safe and healthy pursuit for the youth of
Japan and the rest of the world.
Judo can be regarded from two different
view points — the first self defence and
the second, sport. The confusion between
these two in the west arose from its
being taught to army and police personnel
primarily tor self defence and the way it
is used in many films. This is not to say
that the exponents of soort iudo would not
be at an advantage should they need to
defend themselves.
Judo is a line all-round exercise tor
people of all ages, developing body-
mind coordination, patience, consideration,
strength and endurance: Sei Ryoko Z e n
Y o — the full and most beneficial use of
all the faculties (Jigoro Kano). It can
be divided into several groups of tech-
niques — Osaekomiwaza (holding), Newaza
(grappling), Tachniwaza (throwing),
Shimewaza (strangling) and Kansetsuwaza
(arm-locking). The art of striking (Atemi-
waza) is not included in sport judo.
The Club at IC
The IC Judo Club, for both men and
women, is one of the most active London
University clubs, having a large mat
(over 850 sq ft) and 1st Dan black belt
tuition. The club meets in the gym of the
Union in Prince Consort Road on Tuesdays
and Thursdays from 6.30 to 8.00. Gradings
are held regularly at the University of
London Union and at the Budokwai (one
of Europes leading clubs). The usual
evening consists ot a warm-up period,
falling practice (Ukemi), throwing
practice (Uchikomi) —where the techniques
are polished, a taught section with
related practice and finally Randori or
free practice. The evening ends with
loosening-up exercises, a warm shower
and some socialising in the downstairs
bar. Beginners are welcome at this club,
and tor those who are more experienced
there is also the opportunity to practise
at one of London's many non-university
establishments.
It is hoped this year that some inter-
college evenings can be arranged and
that the club will continue to be a lively
and friendly one.
There is also a black belt coach tor
Aikido. a very graceful and powerful
form of self defence; again it is for both
men and women.
