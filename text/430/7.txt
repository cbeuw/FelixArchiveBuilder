Sounds about town
Broadcast radio has now been in
London for 54 years, starting humbly
with 2LO broadcasting from the roof
of Selfridges by the British Broadcast-
ing Company. The BBC rapidly opened
other stations throughout the country
and was made a public corporation.
in 1927 (perhaps they'll be celebrating
another 50th aniversary next year?).
During the 30's the BBC changed
it's structure to the 'National' and
an alternative network of regional
stations. After the war the 'National'
became the 'Light Programme' and
the regionals the 'Home Service'.
These were joined by the 'Third
Programme' in the late 40's. Domestic
broadcasting until this time had been
on the long and medium wave but the
50's saw the introduction of the
lirst VHF transmitters.
Outside law, not illegal
During the 50's and early 60's it
was generally assumed that television
would virtually replace radio in the
future. This theory was proved not
necessarily correct by the pirates in
the mid 60's. The first of the pirates
was Radio Caroline, broadcasting
from a boat anchored off the Essex
coast. The pirates exploited the
advantages of radio over TV. Like
its low cost, its personel appeal and
its ability to form images in the mind
of the lieiener. These stations were
in international waters so they were
outside the law (rather than illegal).
The government attempted, fairly
successfully, to control these stations
in 1967 by making any link that they
had with the UK illegal (although
they do not have any control over the
broadcasting itself). This saw the
death of most of the pirates.
The pirates had clearly demon-
strated that radio was still very much
alive, so the BBC pushed ahead on
two fronts; it split the Light Programme

into the present Radio 1 and 2 and it
re-introduced local stations.
In October 1973 the first of .the
reconstituted IBA's commercial
stations, LBC, opened; this has been
followed by 18 other stations.
The two London local commercial
stations, LBC and Capital Radio do
command a fair audience but do not
seem to be paying well. Both have
had to be helped in the recent past
by Canadian interests (now 29% of
Capital Radio and 49.5% of LBC)
possible reasons for this are LBC's
original costing for it supplying news
for the projected 60 stations whilst
only 19 are on the air and Capital's
enormous staff (over 200) including
people on big star salaries.
Friendly Radio London
Of the London stations the one to
watch in the future is the BBC local
station, Radio London, the audience
figures are rising rapidly - a fact
that will not surprise anyone who has
met its manager, Alan Holden, who is
a major driving force. Anyone who has
been to several of the stations, as I
have, cannot have failed to notice
the very friendly atmosphere of the
station compared with some of the.
others.
Future depends on Annan report
The future of broadcasting is
currently held in the balance awaiting
the publication of the Annan
Committee report on its future. The
outcome of this is hard to predict but
they have already stated that they
are in favour of local radio so it
would seem that it is here to stay in
some form. There is some speculation
that local radio will be taken from
both the BBC and IBA and be controlled
by the same body-.
LBC Where news comes first
The first commercial radio station i n
Britain w a s L B C (the London Broad-
casting Company) which opened i n
October 1973 a week before its sister
station C a p i t a l Radio^ T h e format is very
different from that of a l l the other
commercial stations a s it is intended
to be a news and information station with
the image 'LBC — where news comes

s squeezed out
Initially their programmes were a
vaguely news — based — magazine
format; these have now been sharpened
up during the daytime, but unfortunately
(due to limited finances) the London news
has been squeezed.out and there are a
considerable number of information
spots, which only allow a few minutes
of news interviews before the next one
begins.
The heart of the station i s the
newroom, it i s here that the news
bulletins are compiled from correspondents
a l l over the world. Other stations either
relay these bulletins live (under the
name of Independant R a d i o News — I R N )
or use the reports to add to l o c a l news
