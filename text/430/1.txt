NUS acts to thwart IC
'Stop undercutting'
E L E C T I O N F E V E R gripped
the RCSli when fourteen, no
less, nominations were made
for the title 'Queen of Jez'.
Last date for nominations
was last Tuesday, and unfort-
unately (but as expected) the
the proposal of the RCSU V P ,
Steve Braund, was declared
invalid.
The successful candidate
this year is Paola Muszynska,
(hope I got that right) who is
a first year Life Scientist.
says NUS
The National Union of Students has this week warned IC
Union that it cannot expect any more student discount cards if
the Union continues to sell them at £1.75. IC Union had initially
bought a batch of 200 discount cards and associated handbooks.
The d e c i s i o n to s e l l the
cards at less than the recom-
mended £2 was taken at last
w e e k ' s Union General Meeting
following an I C Union
E x e c u t i v e recommendation.
Union officers argued that
if the cards were sold at £2
then the Union would receive
a 50p commission on each card
s o l d , a n amount inconsistent
with the extra administrative
work required.
The warning came from
discount scheme organiser
Pete A n w y l w h o v i s i t e d
Imperial shortly after an
executive meeting last Monday.
He told Honorary Secretary
John White that if the Union
anticipated s e l l i n g the next
batch of cards at less than
the recommended £2 then I C U
could forget the additional
supplies.

SSRC M I C R O S C O P E
The Social Science R e s e a r c h
C o u n c i l plans to make a n
annaul grant of £100,000 for
the creation of a P o l i c y
Studies Centre early next year,
according to a report in the
Times Higher Education
Supplement last F r i d a y . The
function of this centre w i l l be
fo analyse the making and
implementation of Government
p o l i c i e s .
The Centre would probably
be based on a n e x i s t i n g
university department or
research institute, and the
L S E has been offered a s a
p o s s i b l e home by i t s director,
Professor Ralf Dahrendorf.
The E x e c u t i v e had formerly
been advised by the U n i o n
Solicitor that the U n i o n would
be on firm ground provided it
was U n i o n policy to s e l l the
cards at £1.7 5, and provided
this offer w a s only open to
IC students.
Speaking to F E L I X Pete
A n w y l refuted this argument
stressing that a n e x p l i c i t
condition of buying the cards
from N U S was that they be
sold at £ 2 . He was particularly
concerned about the I C
d e c i s i o n since he c l a i m s the
U n i o n h a s been told many
times in the last 3 months
that it must s e l l the card at
its f u l l p r i c e . Furthermore this
condition is e x p l i c i t l y made in
the briefing manual issued to
Unions like I C U .
Mr A n w y l w a s a l s o worried
s i n c e I C U are presently
undercutting two N U S service
companies E n d s l e i g h Insurance
and N U S T r a v e l , both of
whom are s e l l i n g the card at
£2 a n d both of whom have
offices within half a mile of
I C .
No d e c i s i o n has been
made about the cards by I C
Union s i n c e Mr A n w y l ' s v i s i t .
The matter i s expected to be
d i s c u s s e d at this Monday's
Executive meeting and at the
next U G M on October 28th. So
far, i n a week of trading I C U
has sold just over 100 c a r d s .
A c c o r d i n g to Mr A n w y l the
scheme i s otherwise fairing
quite well and demand for the
card h a s so far exceeded
expectation. N U S h a s ordered
a reprint of the card and
handbook, 50,000 of each had
initially been printed.
