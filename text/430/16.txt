charm of BB , but CCC
still succeeds
IC novices take Tanners trophy
U n l i k e the large multi-
national toiletry companies we
cannot afford (although I'm
sure A C C would look sympath-
e t i c a l l y on our case if we
could,) the l i k e s of Brigette
Bardot, Margaux Hemingway
in order to s e l l what we have
to offer. Instead they've
found someone much better
(especially if y o u are a
female) me!
I C C C C (as it i s known)
was last season the most
s u c c e s s f u l college team i n the
London running scene. T h e
hardcore of that team is s t i l l
at c o l l e g e , s o we a i m to have
yet another good year. F o r
those who like facts last
season I C C C C w o n the London
colleges league, w a s best
college side i n the C o u r a g e ' s
league, runner's up i n the
St Edmund H a l l relay . . . How-
ever do not think that we only
cater for budding Brendan
F o s t e r ' s ; we cater for a l l
a b i l i t i e s and a l l are welcome
to join — great runner's are
born, good ones are trained.
The obvious question to
ask i s where do we run?
Training runs are held in
Hyde P a r k , Home fixtures i n
Richmond park, a n d there are
many other races a t various
venues around a n d away from
London. *
I C C C C organises the
Hyde Park relay. T h i s is the
largest event of its kind (well
in B r i t a i n at least). It i s a
6 x 3 miles relay around the
Serpentine. L a s t year over
100 teams entered, many from
the continent, and the athlete
with the fastest time w a s
Dave Moorcroft of Montreal
1 500m fame.
So if y o u think y o u are
another L a s s e V i r e n or want
to run just to keep f i t , we can
promise you good competition,
good company, and good beer
(only real a l e i s consumed).

club notice board to the right

During the Summer V a c ,
several people from I C took
part i n the 'Tanners Marathon'.
T h i s i s a n annual 30 mile
endurance walk over the foot-
paths of the North Downs.
Whilst it i s not officially a
race, most people go as fast
i a s they c a n , either walking
or jogging or a bit of each.
T h i s year w a s the first
time that IC had entered a
team, and f e w of the I C
participants had ever covered
such a distance before. T h e
course took i n a number of.
the highest Surrey h i l l s ,
including L e i t h H i l l and
Ranmore Common, and to a d d
to the toughness of the c o u r s e ,
the day w a s one of the hottest
of the summer.
F i r s t to finish'from IC were
those stalwarts of I C C r o s s -
j Country C l u b , Pete Johnson
i and Steve Webb, who achieved
I third place i n the •remarkable
I time of 5 hours 40 minutes.
Not far behind, i n 12th and
13th p l a c e s , were A l a n L e a k e y
and R o b A l l i n s o n , whilst last
years Cross-Country C a p t a i n ,
Ian E l l i s strolled round i n
7 hours 37 m i n u t i s . B r i n g i n g
the team home 9 hours 12
minutes (well within the 10
hour time limit) were Martin
K e s s l e r and Keith Sugden.
The team results are based
on the average time of the
first s i x finishers i n each
team. We were amazed to find
that we were the first team,
with an average of 6 hours
58 minutes, over half a n hour
better than the second team.
Whilst there were 485
people on the 30 mile event,
there w a s also a 50 mile event
on the same day w h i c h had
59 people. David R o s e n , the
IC Orienteering C l u b C a p t a i n
was first finisher of the 5 0 ,
breaking the record for the
Tanners 50 by nearly a n hour,
taking 8 hours 39 minutes.
