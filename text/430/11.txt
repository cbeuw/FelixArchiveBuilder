12 - FELIX, O C T O B E R 15th 1976
T H E S H O O T I S T ( P a r a m o u n t , A ) d i r e c t e d
by D o n Siegel; starring John Wayne
and Lauren Baca I i with James Stewart,
Richard Boone and Hugh O ' B r i a n .
Don S i e g e l ' s latest film, The Shoe-list,
is a simple one in that the storyline is
simple, the morality of it i s simple a n d , it
is simply and effectively done. And like
all simple things it is good; in fact very
good indeed. S i e g e l ' s treatment of the
film turns a potential weepy into an
entertaining and at times quite funny
film.
The film i s s e t at the turn of the
century. On the day everybody i s mourning
Queen V i c t o r i a ' s death, J B Brooks
(played with authority and presence by
John Wayne) rides into C a r s o n C i t y ,
Anyone remotely interested i n gym-
nastics, musical comedy or philosophy
should hasten to the Lyttelton Theatre to
see the revival of T o m Stoppard's
Jumpers. Even if none of these t i c k l e s
your fancy then I can guarantee that you
w i l l not be bored by this stupendous
production. Mr Stoppard's talent for
witty paradox and double entendre
succeeds a hundred times over.
Who, but Mr Stoppard could have
conceived the character of George
Moore, Professor of moral philosophy,
lovingly brought to life by Michael
Hordern? George, the only member of the
University Philosophy faculty who
doesn't take part in the acrobatics
organised by the V i c e - C h a n c e I lor, (Sir
Archibald Jumper M D , D P h i l , D L i t t , L D ,
D P M , D P T (Gym).)devotes h i s talents to
attempting practical demonstrations of
Z e n o ' s paradoxes, by shooting an arrow
at a target and by racing a tortoise
against a hare.
Meanwhile h i s wife, Dorothy, a
famous musical comedy star, played by
J u l i e Covington, remains enticingly in
her bedroom with the body of the Pro-
fessor of L o g i c . Dorothy has retired
from the stage s i n c e Man landed on the
Moon (yet another facet of Mr Stoppard's
lunar o b s e s s i o n and passes the day
creating elaborate charades and watching
a small television whose screen i s blown
up on the back wall for the audience's
benefit.)
Whilst the play contains numerous
moments of effective theatricality it
lacks any coherent thread; instead the
audience i s kept going by the expectation,
fully s a t i s f i e d , of the next coup d e
theatre. There i s stunning acrobatics from
a team of yellow suited Jumpers and
M i s s Covington's singing of the Moon
songs i s excellent.
A l s o at the Lyttelton are Howard
Brenton's Weapons of Happiness and
Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. In the first
Mr Brenton s u c c e s s f u l l y depicts the
takeover of a South London c r i s p
factory by a particularly inept group of
youths led by an idealistic girl hankering
after a Marxist s o c i e t y . T h e play is
firmly rooted to reality by flashbacks to
Eastern Europe in the fifties and by the
character of Josef Frank (Frank F i n l a y )
who h a s escapted from C z e c h o s l o v a k i a
where he was A s s i s t a n t Secretary of the
Communist Party, and come to ground at
mmm
Wayne legend fights on
Nevada. He goes to see h[s friend Doc
Hostetler (James Stewart) who confirms
his worst fears. He, Brooks, is suffering
from terminal cancer.
Determined to make the town h i s
last resting place he takes a room in
Mrs Rogers' (played by Laurne Bacall)
house by deceiving her that he is
William H i c k c o c k . When she d i s c o v e r s to
her chagrin and anger that he has duped
her she demands that he leaves but he
does not. H e does not even do s o when
the town's pompous and windbag of a
sherriff orders him t o .
However, the s n i v e l l i n g sherriff's
fears give way to cock-a-hoop delight
when Brooks tells him that he (Brooks) is
dying. Marshall Thibido is s o pleased
that when he v i s i t s Brooks the next day
following a shoot-out between Brooks and
his two would-be k i l l e r s , he is moved to
ask Brooks how poorly he i s .
He is not the only one. The undertaker,
spying Brooks in the barbershops drops
in to do business and finds himself
deprived of 50 dollars a s investment,
the barber too, i s not a bad businessman,
he sweeps up Brooks' hair and a bit more
besides in order to s e l l locks of it
when Brooks d i e s .
Brooks does not keep them waiting
long. Before he is shot in the back by
the bartender (his third eye finally
failed him) he eliminates three of the
town's more unsavoury characters. A s he
s a y s , he never shot a man who d i d not
deserve it.
A well tempoed film that never s l a c k s
in pace and is tanti Using to the last.
It is well worth a v i s i t .
Witty Stoppard has second
Jumpers succes
last in the crisp factory. What could
contrast more with Weapons of Happiness
than Blithe Spirit? Noel Coward's wartime
piece on death is given a spirited
performance by a cast that includes
E l i z a b e t h Spriggs a s Madame A r c a t i .
The play transfers to the O l i v i e r in the
autumn.
Donkeys' Years is a new Michael
Frayn comedy set at an Oxbridge C o l l e g e
reunion. Twenty years on the old students
return to renew acquaintance and refresh
their memories of the happiest days of
their l i v e s . Penelope Keith has earned
the soubriquet of " T h e funniest woman in
the West E n d " , for her performance which
didn't quite live up to the expectations
formed from the B B C ' s Good Life s e r i e s .
The reason that The Family Dance i s
proving s o popular is that its cast i s s o
terrific. A l e c McCowen and Michael
Bryant head a cast w h i c h , according to
one review, could make the London
telephone directory a smash h i t . The play
is the usual run of the mill piece about
middle-age envy of youth and is drawing
Americans like flies to fly-paper.
