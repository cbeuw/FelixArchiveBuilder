Many of y o u , second and third years
as well a s freshers, may be asking " w h a t
is external a f f a i r s . " ? T h e purpose of
this column over the coming weeks i s to
attempt to answer that question and a l s o
to inform and stimulate d i s c u s s i o n on
external affairs. External A f f a i r s i »
mainly concerned with other student
bodies in the U K — co-operating on
matters of common interest, taking part
in and influencing d e c i s i o n s taken by
corporate student organisations. A t
present, apart from individual student
unions, the main areas of activity are
within the National Union of Students,
the University of London Union and the
London Students Organisation (the last
subject to possibly change at the next
UGM). Over the next few weeks I intend
to explain the aims and organisation of
these three, together with a few notes on
the political groups within student p o l i t i c s .
One-of the most controversial bodies is
the N U S , a confederation of independent
student unions. N U S is the only national
students organisation, although there are a
significant number of unions not in
membership. T h e N U S aims to represent
student interests nationally and a l s o to
a s s i s t student unions. In some c a s e s it
a s s i s t s individual students with problems
they may have. T o this end it maintains
a large staff centered at E n s l e i g h St
London together with field officers
scattered throughout B r i t a i n .
NUS a l s o runs a large travel service
(currently running at a very big l o s s ) , an
insurance brokerage (Endsleigh), a
marketing s e r v i c e and a printing firm (all
making a slight profit).
NUS policy
The policy of the union is decided by
two conferences every year, one at the
end of this term and the other during the
easter vacation. The policy is carried out
External Affairs:
NUS-a brief
guide
under the direction of an executive of
seventeen, including four full time
officers (earning about £2500 pa) a l l
elected at t h e . E a s t e r conference. Every
union in membership h a s the right to
send delegates to the conferences but
less than half in fact do s o , despite
the introduction of a conference subsidy
fund. O n e delegate i s sent for every
thousand or part of a thousand full time
students in a union. I C U therefore send
five delegates a s w e l l a s three observers.
At the present day conferences reports
from the executive on the execution of
previous mandates are received and
policies on subjects ranging from the
next years grant claim to the Angolan
c i v i I war are d e c i d e d .
Broad Left dominate N
U
S
The problem with the N U S i s that it
is seen to be out of touch with the
ordinary student and dominated by the
ultra-left wing by conventional political
standards. A t the moment the N U S
executive c o n s i s t s of fifteen members of
the Broad Left - a mixture of Communists
and left wing labour " s t u d e n t s " , an
International Marxist (ultra-ultra-left
wing), and a member of the Federation of
Conservative Students - the first to
be elected for several years. T h e main
reason for this total domination of the
N U S by one particular group i s the
undemocrtrtic nature of the conference
F E L I X , October 15th 1976 - S
and the method of election of the
executive.
The delegates to conference emerge
from their unions by many methods; some,
like u s , e l e c t them by campus wide
ballot or from a U G M , others send
delegates ex-offcio (ie President,
External A f f a i r s V P ) , and at some
c o l l e g e s the delegates are appointed
by the union e x e c u t i v e .
Undemocratic elections
These delegates, who must be
a c t i v i s t s just to attend conference, then
e l e c t t h e e x e c u t i v e in a fairly undemocratic
election. Over the last year their have
been attempts to bring in direct e l e c t i o n s
of at least some members of the e x e c u t i v e .
Not suprisingly the Broad Left were,
and s t i l l a r e , unwilling to give up
control of the N U S to students.
A t present the policy of IC Union i s
that w e recognise that the N U S i s undem-
o c r a t i c , and that drastic steps are needed
to change i t s structure. I C U feels that
a working party should be set up to
investigate this more thoroughly.
T h i s year ICU w i l l pay a b o u t 5 5 0 0 8 to
N U S in affiliation fees.
On h
o
m
e ground
The External A f f a i r s committee has a
number of v a c a n c i e s for which nomination
papers are now up in the Lower L o u n g e .
If anyone feels the desire to get involved
in the union through external affairs
either contact me through the union
office or just s t i c k your name on a
nomination paper.
