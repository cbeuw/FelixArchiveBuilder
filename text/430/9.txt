F i r s t the bad news, Flamin Groovies won't be playing at
I C on November 6th after a l L T h e i r B r i t i s h tour has been
put back a week and now starts on November 11th at the
unlikely Redcar C o a l h a m B o w l , with the main London g i g at
C h a l k Farm Roundhouse on 14th November. However, the
1C E n t s committee have been offered the Groovies o n 11th
December, but no final contracts have yet been s i g n e d .
It looks very likely that Split Enz (reviewed i n the last
F e l i c i t y ) w i l l be headlining here on 27th November. So far the
band have only played a handful of gigs and the IC date w i l l
probably be the first time they've headlined i n L o n d o n . Not to
be m i s s e d . N e w s a l s o that Ralph McTell might be appearing
here on November 20th, if anyone is interested i n that sort
of thing... Further details of Saturday nights concert featuring
Graham Parker and the Rumour. Support band w i l l be Blue
Angel and tickets are priced at 80p i n advance for I C students.

advance and £2 on the njght.
