"We have with u.s in the studio today the celebrated
Mrs Florence Cruddy."
Radio O n e i s the newest B B C
network a n d a l s o the one with the
largest audience figures. It started at the
end of September 1976 soon after the
pirates were made illegal and was a n
obvious copy o f their s t y l e . It w a s
formed by splitting the Light Programme
which w a s o n long wave, medium wave
and V H F into Radio One and T w o ;
Radio One getting the medium wavelength
making it the only B B C network not o n
V H F , a situation which s t i l l e x i s t s .
Since then R a d i o One has come a long
way although it s t i l l has rather restricted
hours of separate programming
Personality station
Radio One i s e s s e n t i a l l y a personality
station a s opposed to most commercial
stations w h i c h concentrate o n the
m u s i c . One of the major personalities
is N o e l Edmonds who presents the
breakfast show every weekday morning
from 7 am until 9 a m . Noel reached
this top show v i a a highly s u c c e s s f u l
Sunday Morning show o n R a d i o One and
R a d i o Luxembourg. F E L I X asked him
how he saw h i s role as a breakfast time
D J ; ' / see my job as essentially being a
bright and breezy link between the
music, personality injections between the
music conveying information,but generally
just trying to smooth the whole thing
along'.
Choice and variety missing
N o e l ' s music i s chosen from a p l a y l i s t
by h i s producer, the only effect he has
on it i s through c h o o s i n g h i s record of
the week and influencing the producer.
R a d i o O n e music i s generally chart
m u s i c , which Noel described a s 'across
the board good music' although he does
have m i s g i v i n g s about this p o l i c y : 7
don't believe that any station should be
tied to a chart, because it almost
suggests you're following the public. I
reckon a really successful station ought
to lead the public. Give them the choice
and variety. If you are tied totally to
what a group of people is buying, I
don't think that is a good thing'. Indeed
since the advert of B r i t i s h commercial
radio, R a d i o One h a s been able to
answer c r i t i c i s m that it was not playing
a record that the producers d i d not
believe suited the station.
'Capital - a mess'
What d i d Noel think of commercial
radio and C a p i t a l i n particular'. 7 think
Capital is an awful mess although I
listen to it a lot. I think that Capital is
a bit of a contradiction in a way. It's
trying to be both a personality station
and a music station at the same time'.
He thought that there w a s room for
another commercial station i n London
which could have a highly selective
p o l i c y , perhaps like R a d i o C a r o l i n e .
Commercial radio has meant a drop in
the Radio One audience but not nearly
as great a s would be expected by the
commercial radio figures. T h i s indicates
that commercial radio has to a large
extent created i t ' s own audience and
promoted a new awareness i n B r i t i s h
radio; a situation that N o e l i s quite
pleased about (and he s t i l l has 8 m i l l i o n
listeners!) E v e n with the attraction of
commercial radio Noel i s very happy
where he i s a n d i s not interested in
moving, he sees Radio O n e as c l o s e to
his ideal statron.
F i n a l l y what changes would Noel
like to see? He would like t o see a
tighter station with i t s o w n charts and
more hours s o they c a n broadcast until
midnight, after a l l R a d i o O n e i s by
far the cheapest of the B B C networks
to run.
RADIO LONDON - TRUE LOCAL STATION
Continued from page 8
R a d i o L o n d o n h a s a l w a y s been a
problem station since it i s much larger
then any other l o c a l station (with a
potential audience of nearly 11 million)
but run w i t h i n the confines of l o c a l
radio.
T h i s problem became acutely obvious
when the commercial stations opened and
were able very convincingly to beat
R a d i o L o n d o n i n Audience ratings.
E i g h t e e n months ago A l a n Holden moved
to R a d i o L o n d o n from the highly s u c c e s s -
ful R a d i o Manchester a n d initiated a
major re orientation of the station w h i c h
has already resulted i n at least doubling,
if not trebling the audience figures — a
remarkable achievement. I a s k e d h i m
what he w a s aiming for with the station.
He explained that Radio London i s the
only mixed channel i n London and he
tries to attract a family audience,
although not a l l at the same time. He
tries to stress the local influence and
concentrates on l o c a l common denom-
ination like education or transport rather
than parochial affairs. A l l this i s covered
with a s much gloss a s p o s s i b l e as this i s
a l s o a part of the London scene. He
achieves this with a broadcast staff of
around 40 people — quite a task.
Rare breed .
T o see the station i s action I v i s i t e d
Susie B a r n e s ' ' R u s h Hour' programme one
morning and s a w their two new studios
in a c t i o n , (Alan Holden described the
difference between these and their o l d
studies a s 'like driving an Alfa Romeo
after driving a Ford Poplar'). Susie was
in one studio where s h e operated the
jingle machines and records w h i l s t
news, interviews and outside items
came from the other studio. T h i s arrange-
ment allowed Susie to have considerable
control over the 'sound' of her programme
without having to operate everything
herself.
Susie i s one of the rare breed of
broadcasters w h o started right a t the
bottom. She joined the B B C , at B r o a d -
c a s t i n g H o u s e , a s a secretary to a
secretary and came to R a d i o L o n d o n i n
1970 v i a the o l d L i g h t Programme a n d
R a d i o 1 and 2 wheee she was a production
a s s i s t a n t .
In her ' R u s h Hour' programme Susie
tries to present news and information i n
an entertaining w a y , providing a n
alternative to a l l other stations w h i c h
are either hard news or s o l i d m u s i c .
Another way that it provides a n alter-
native i s by having a woman presentor.
(In fact whilst I was there it was almost
a female takeover, with a woman panel
operator i n the other studio, a woman
traffic reporter, a weather woman and a
woman news reader) I wondered whether
Susie had found i t difficult to be i n
e s s e n c i a l l y a man's world but s h e
stressed that everyone o n the station
was employed o n their merits a s a
broadcaster; a s far a s the p u b l i c w a s
concerned s h e had had very little
adverse reaction to her presenting the
breakfast time s h o w .
A major feature o f l o c a l radio,
particularity i n L o n d o n , i s the phone-in
programmes, which are used o n this
station. T h e s e programmes have been
much c r i t i s e d but they do get some o f
the station's best audience figures
A l a n Holden l i k e s to structure these
programmes more than most other stations,
as he f e e l s that this i s when they are
most useful and constructive; he a l s o
thinks it e s s e n t i a l to have a 'major
a b i l i t y ' presenting the show.
'Radio London is the real local radio
in London' i s how A l a n Holden summed
up the whole station.
