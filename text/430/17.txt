WHITE LIES SPECIAL-
HALLS INSURANCE
by IC Union Hon. Sec. John White
personal pursuits and pastimes
- L i m i t o f Indemnity £100,000',
ie if a student does accidental
damage and/or accidental
injury to another student or
member of the public, he i s
covered wherever negligence is
legally proved.
T h i s policy:
(a) does not cover claims
a r i s i n g from noise, commotion
e t c .
(b) i s an individual cover,
not a group o n e . Therefore,
H a l l organised events are not
covered.
Cover is provided:
(a) in the c a s e where a
student is moved within the
h a l l s e g for decoration of
rooms e t c .
(b) in the service areas, e g
lifts, laundry, T V lounge, e t c .
The bars w i l l not be covered
by this policy s i n c e C o l l e g e
is the licensee.
A l l this information w a s
composited last year by Johns
Downs and was correct at that
time. I am pretty sure that the
current insurance situation is
identical but anyway if y o u
do have any queries about
insurance then drop in and
see me.
Just a final point. Y o u
may ask the question "Why the
hell should I have to pay for
insurance for my p o s s e s s i o n s ? "
Well, since term has started
I have had to issue 4 c l a i m s
forms for this policy already!
Will you need one tomorrow?
