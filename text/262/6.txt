ENTS FINISH
YEAR ON £850
Praise be to the Ents cohorts! Despite the threatened resigna-
tion last term of the chairman, secretary and treasurer, despite the
loss of £70 on Zoot Money, despite the speedy demise of the Plastic
Fairytale, Ents have raked in a total profit of £850. It's the first time
in several years that Ents have made a profit—last year they lost £200.
Furthermore, the entertainments provided this year must rank as the
best ever. For the May Ball, the Scaffold, Auger and Driscoll, and
Tyrannosauras Rex were featured; while over the past three terms the
Concert Hall has reverberated to the mighty amps of such groups as
The Honeybus, the Marmalade, the Moody Blues, Zoot Money,
Dantalion's Chariot and l.C's. very own time machine, 1984. Finally,
for the Carnival Hop, Ents featured, at £385 a snip, the biggest act of
the season in Traffic.
Traffic in action; on guitar, Stevfe Winwood; on organ, Chris
Woods; on drums, the muscular Jim Capaldi.
Unfortunately, Traffic were not
the universal knock-out one might
hope for on an end of season
fim'.e. Loosely categorized as a
"progressive" grewp, they elected
to play none of their hits, and
only two numbers of their " Mr.
Fantasy " LP, these being "Mr.
Fantasy" himself and a much
extended version of " Coloured
Rain " (" it's in two movements,
actually." said Chris Woods)
The rest of the act was a selection
of generally long, self-penned
numbers, these largely instru-
mental improvisation with lead
vocal (where necessary) by Steve
Winwood. Twelve minutes worth
of " A New Dawn" produced
little worthwhile. Chris Woods
on amplified sax played well
enough, but Winwood's organ-
work was a large-scale disappoint-
ment. In any case both were half
drowned by the crashing drums
of Jim Capaldi, who for sheer
power puts Keith Moon well in
the shade. Winwood played
guitar on the opening instrumen-
tal, also on "Who Knows What
Tomorrow Will Bring " the lyrics
of which were probably fairly
subtle if one could have heard
what they were, above the din.
Woods' flute was good on "20,000
Headmen" and Winwood's guitar
passable on " Mr. Fantasy." The
best number was the closer
" Blind Man " (original by Bobby
" B l u e " Bland), probably the
most polished piece of the act.
Audience reaction was varied,
from those who shouted "Rub-
bish! " to the twee dolly up at the
front who whispered " Gosh
Stevie, that was brilliant." My
impression was that Traffic have
still not got together as a group
and that if they are going to treat
audiences to an extended experi-
ment in free form pop they had
better think about it a bit more.
Also on the bill was Joe Cocker
—good voice, but lousy chore-
ography. £25 was lost on the
night, although about 200 non
Union card holders were turned
away.

If you were to draw a graph of
the greatest speed at which man
has travelled at any time in his-
tory to the present day you would
get a curve that starts to bend tip
at the beginning of the industrial
revolution. In an attempt to
straighten the curve so that an
equation can be fitted to it you
may well take logs of the speed
against date as abcissa. The curve
would still have much the same
shape. A log log would yield
the same result and you would
notice that they all tend asympto-
tically to the year 2000 approxi-
mately.
So what?
You would get a similar result
if you were to draw a graph of
total world power consumption
against time. I find the concept
of infinite speed or power in-
teresting.
So what?
About two years ago, New
York had a seventeen hour power
cut, the cause of which very few
people "Understand. The food to
feed New York is brought in by
truck. In a power cut traffic
lights and street lights do not
work. In winter it is cold in
New York, People in New
York in a power cut might get
cold and hungry. They might go
and look for wood in the streets
in great mobs. Have you ever
read " Day of the Triffids "? In
30 years time there is going to be
an urban district from Boston to
Washington. Food will largely
be brought in by electric train or
truck. In winter it is cold . . .
So what?
Homo Sapiens has cultivated
land for 600 generations. With
agriculture you can afford to for-
get the doctrine of survival of the
fittest because you don't have to
spend all your time finding food
just to feed yourself and your
family. You can afford to feel
sorry for the village idiot and give
him food or help. Unfit animals
usually die before puberty. If
they don't this upsets the genetic
method of improving the stock of
a species. IQ is subject to dis-
persion from the norm, as is
height, weight, etc. Survival of
the fittest chops either or both
ends of the scale off. This no
longer happens. The average IQ
drops—the norm stays the same.
The norm IQ of the Caucasian
peoples is 130.
So what?
The present Western society
(technology and economy etc.)
depends on the maxim : Expand
or collapse. An expansion of
technology requires more brains,
an expansion requires a void to
flow into.
So what?
I draw no conclusions—do
you

" FANTASTIC FOLK "
Electra EUK 259
This L.P., with its amazingly
garish cover and even more garish
title, is an anthology containing
many good things.
Each of the twelve singers on
the record has one track. The
album features, amongst others,
Tom Rush, Judy Collins, and the
Incredibles. There is also Tom
Paxton's original version of his
much-abused "Bottle of Wine."
Phil Ochs sings "Hills of West
Virginia," which is very pleasant,
and unbelievably enough for him,
is not a protest song.
With records at their present
high prices, anthologies like this
could be the answer for those
who want* variety in their listen-
ing; this record is a fairly good
one of the type. Alternatively,
like me, you may prefer to spend
your money on a record by one
artist. In this way the richness
and variety of the style of artists
of the calibre of those on " Fan-
tastic Folk " may fully be appre-
ciated. The choice is entirely
yours.

The Carnival Fete was some-
thing of a washout. Dismantled
during a downpour at 2 p.m.
while Southside cheered, it finally
got under way at 3. Such attrac-
tions as there were included a
malceshift tenpin bowling rink, a
coconut shy, and Chinese sweet-
meats. The big draw was how-
ever the traditional ritual of
dowsing the more prominent
among us with cold water—6d.
a go. Martin Lack in trans-
vestite bikini garb opened the
proceedings and sat out the first
15 minutes. He was followed by
courageous Jane Pearson, Pete
Ruhemann, Dermott Corr, Bob
Mackman, Chris O'Donnell and
others. Notable for their absence
were President Ray " Flip-Flop "
Phillips and his sidekick Dave
Harris.
The fete just about broke even. Martin Lack phis bftmi get soaked.
G O O D REVUE
POOR DRAW
Playing to small houses a fort-
night ago, the DramSoc Carnival
Revue failed to achieve its full
potential. This basically was due
to the number of subtle or " in "
jokes and sketches which really
require large audiences to be
sure of their being appreciated.
Temptation Sordid or Virtue
Rewarded was the title of the
melodrama. The Villains were a
certain Sir Jasper and a very nice
piece called Fanny. This closed
with the excellent moral, hard
learned by the best: " If you
want to stay a good clean boy,
don't go near a Fanny."
Of the songs, I very much en-
joyed " I f Ray ruled the world,"
which certainly contained some
novel suggestions such as "All the
Ducketts would be sent to the
moon" as to how to improve
the IC Union, though whether
these would be good ideas I very
much doubt.
The finale was also musical and
dedicated to portraying various
College dignitaries headed by
"Dear Rector, Lord Penney."
All in all, it was a most enjoyable
evening and probably the best
organised Carnival effort of the
year.
About £25 was made for Car-
nival.
