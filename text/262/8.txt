Underwater in the Med
(Or how to succeed in breathing
underwater without actually
drowning)
For two weeks every Easter
the citizens of the unspoilt, un-
hurried, enchanting fishing town
of La Ciotat, on the Mediter-
ranean coast of France, suffer
from a disease called the Im-
perial College Underwater Club.
It is at this time of year, when a
young diver's fancy turns to
thoughts of mermaids, that the
serious activity of the club is
practised—drinking. To this end,
eighteen souls pitched camp just
outside the town and made frivo-
lous merriment each evening, ac-
companied by guitar-twanging,
complaints in three languages,
and crate? of subsidised beer sup-
plied by the British Army.
It is worthy of record that not
only was it shown beyond all
reasonable doubt that an I.C. stu-
dent could consume more Carls-
berg ale per unit time than an
army private, but he could also
perform more incredible feats of
diving.
The liaison between I.C. and
B.A.O.R.—seconded to France
for " Adventure " training—blos-
somed day by day until the
Officer Commanding was person-
ally recharging the club's aqua-
lungs and chaufFeuring would-be
generals to diving sites in Army
launches.
For the benefit of readers who
are unfamiliar with the events in-
volved in a typical day's diving,
please pull on your swimming
trunks and read on. (Ladies need
not bother with their bikini tops
at this stage).
The day usually starts at the
ungodly hour of 9 a.m. when
gaggles of groaning mortals
emerge from their tents and try
to come to terms with their hang-
overs. Breakfast consists of the
following ingredients: insipid
brown fluid which purports to be
coffee; and hard-boiled egg
rolls. (As a sequel to these and
other meals, the female catering
officer has since been sold to a
lusty 25-stone Eskimo cannibal.)
After this delicacy everyone
travels to the chosen diving site,
unloads all the gear, and spends
the rest of day shivering.
The divers dive from an inflat-
able boat, always in pairs or
threes to double or treble the
danger as the case may be, and in
spite of overwhelming odds such
as huge waves and man-eating
sharks, some are known to have
actually reached the boat again
on re-surfacing. The log reveals
that they found a number of oc-
topus, starfish, and even a dog-
fish-like aquatic animal which is
reported to have survived the
thrust of a nine-inch diver's
knife. The sole (pun unintended)
eye-witness and operator of the
said knife insist that the weapon
bounced, yeah bounced, from the
head of this vast creature but a
good deal of speculation remains.
It is not untrue that the immen-
sity of the beast increases with
the number of times that the
story is recounted.
The experienced collectors re-
turned from the sea with coral,
Sponge, fern, sea-urchins and
other souvenirs, notably a sign
which read : "Interdit au public,"
borrowed from an underwater
public convenience. (Hmm !)
During the second week depths
of 180 feet were attained and
several people did manage to sur-
vive the " raptures of the deep,"
known scientifically as nitrogen
narcosis. At these depths, the
nitrogen content of the air
breathed from aqualung can give -
rise to hallucinations or an effect
not unlike that produced by over-
indulgence of alcoh6l. It goes
without saying that the achieve-
ment of great depth was a popu-
lar pastime.
For the sake of posterity,
underwater photographs were
taken, but the display of these
has proved unentertaining com-
pared with those taken on the
shore!
One member of the team was
even working! This work —
some would say research — re-
quired the participation of at
least two other divers and defi-
nitely pushed back the frontier
of the science of underwater
communication. The research
was a prelude to an expedition
which will take place in Malta
during the summer, but now the
intripid adventurers have re-
turned to this sceptred isle, com-
plete with Ambre-Solaire sun-
tans, to indulge in one of the
lesser activities of a university—
•studying.
P.S.—" Have you anything to
declare ?" said the Customs
officer.
" 200 Woodbines, a bottle of
red wine, and a 90 per cent proof
bladder," came the muffled reply
through the alcoholic haze at the
back of the Underwater Club
van.

Three months of agitation and demonstration by NUS have
made no difference at all to the Government's intention to halve the
recommended grants increase to students.
From October students in Oxford, Cambridge and London will
get an extra £25, while students elsewhere will get another £20. The
new maximum grants will be £395 and £360 respectively. Students
living at home will get an extra £15 and students resident at Colleges
of. Education £7.
Some concessions have been
been won. The means test level
has been raised from £700 to
£900, as reported in the last but
one issue. The full amount for
supplementary grants has been
paid, this will benefit those with
dependants, mature students,
those studying abroad (the
amount has been revised to keep
the real value the same taking
devaluation into account) and
those studying away,from home
during the vacations.
Commenting on the announce-
ments two weeks ago Trevoi
Fisk, President-elect of the NUS,
welcomed thejconcessions but cal-
led the increases "blatantly in-
adequate " and said : " Thou-
sands of students this autumn
may be faced with the daily choice
between buying a book or a meal.
Either their health or their educa-
tion is bound to suffer/' Fisk may
have been exaggerating but the
second half may well be true for
many students.
At present the grants bill is
about £130 m. and the increases
are likely to add another £5J n>.
to it. More than 300,000 students
receive grants.
MIKE
LOST?
The only clue the Wooden
Horse Club have had to the
whereabouts of Mike was re-
cently found to be a hoax. On
the strength of it WHO had in-
vestigated all the graves round
Clapham Common—without suc-
cess. Mike, stolen ten weeks
ago from under the noses of its
guards, is rumoured to be on
Clapham Common near Halliday
Hall—a likely story.
WHO is suffering from student
apathy at the moment. Its presi-
dent is non-student at present.
Many potential members are
active on the constituent colleges
scene. Meanwhile Mike remains
only a memory.

The most important event to date ins been the ULU cham-
pionships in which IC women came first and the men second, only
four points behind Guy's Hospital, in their respective sections. IC
had some excellent individual victories. Richard Beck, the IC cap-
tain, gained the trophy for the best track performance when he won
the 400 metre final after having recorded 48.5 sees in his heat, an
excellent early season time.
Barry Jones (Chem Eng PG), fully recovered from his heel injury
and in full 100 miles a week training, broke the U L championship
record in the 5000 metres. Barry, who won the New Zealand three-
mile title last year, is hoping to represent his country in the Mexico
Olympics next October.
Paul Jones (Physics III) started the season well with a fine win
in the triple jump and has recently improved his personal best to
45ft. 7£ins. Other victories were Derek Wade, long jump, and Ashley
Deans in the 3000 metre walk
The following Wednesday saw
the U L representatives competing
at Motspur Park against Middle-
sex and the RAF. The remaining
members of the club climbed into
the RCC minibus and headed for
Westminster College, Oxford.
Rather heavier traffic than usual
necessitated several members
having to change en route. Our
depleted team of seven track
athletes entered for a full track
and field programme with mixed
feelings and often put up their
best performances running from
one event's female supporters to
another's. Finally, conceding de-
feat in a surprisingly close match
81-61, the IC team showed their
versatility by giving a diving dis-
play in the heated swimming
pool.
The following Saturday in the
U L match against Cambridge
Norman Morrison (see photo)
beat John Rix, Britain's top
junior miler last year in a per-
sonal best time for the 1500 m.
of 3 mins. 49.1 sees. This is
equivalent to 4 mins. 7 sees, for
the mile and must rate Norman
as one of the brightest prospects
in British athletics.
Last Wednesday saw the begin-
ning of a new era in College ath-
letics, the Inter-College league.
This League is designed to give a
good competition to those people
not good enough to make the U L
team and the support which has
been given to it is most encourag-
ing.
Anybody interested in joining
the Athletics Club should contact
