The renting of houses and flats is a subject where the law has grown into
something «hich all tenants should know, to protect their o
w
n interests. It m

be assumed, in m
a
n
y parts of London, that landlords will k

o
w the relevant
Acts of parliament, in general, tne Rent Acts cover all letting of furnished
and unfurnished properties, except for lets which include meals as a substantial
part of the weekly rent.
UNFURNISHED ACCOMMODATION
Considering eacn case separately, let us first deal witn unfurnished
accomodation. This is defined as a let w

accomodation with his landlord. Tnus, if you share a bathroom with .your landlord,
the let is unfurnished, but if you share a kitcnen with him, the let c

under the relevant Acts for furnished let tings. The 1965 Kent Act applies to
property which on 23 March 19"b had (in London) a rateable value of less ttian
«:400. This i.400- figure relates to the flat w

not to the whole house. Therefore most student accomodation does c

scope of the 1^65 Act.

RENT TRIBUNAL
Another righc that the tena, t has, if his tenancy c

s under the lyb5
Kent Act, is the right to ask the Kent Officer of the local council to fix a
fair rent for his accommodation. If the rent is less than two-thirds of the
rateable value, the Act does not apply, but for this to be true, tne tenant
will be paying a very low rent inueed. Fair rents are assessed by the Rent Officer
on the basis of the age, character and locality of the aewlling, and its state
of repair. The scarcity velue of the property is not taken into eccount. However,
the phrae "fair rent" applies to lancLrords as well, and it s

Officers have applied tnis section in such & w

has been fixed, it is in force tor torm years. The only increases that are
