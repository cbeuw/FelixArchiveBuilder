The end of the year is fast arriving and the time has come when, if
one is not too busy thinking about exams, with the reduction, or to
be more precise, the almost total cessation of Union activities, to look
back over the year, to identify the successes and failures, to think of
how to consolidate the successes and to aVoid the failures next time.
Let us be optimistic and take the successes first. The things which
immediately spring to mind are Carnival, Ents and, of course, the
habitual success of all the clubs, both in terms of intercollcge compe-
tition and in their normal activities, too numerous to mention in a.
whole year's FELIX issues, let alone this short column.
Building on the foundations laid last year by Jerry Stockbridge,
Chris Palmer has significantly increased Carnival's contribution to the
£5,000 mark. The two big factors in this achievement have been the
Albert Hall concert with Donovan and the street collections by the
constituent colleges, notably* Guilds/ 1
The near-abolition of Carnival
week has removed a lot. of the dead wood, but at the same time
destroyed the focal point of the activities. This year the only Car-
nival function which most of the College has been able actually to
participate in has been the street collecting. Carnival, after all, does
belong to the whole College and the danger is that it will become a
small super-efficient organisation, out to extract as much money as
possible for the least effort.
Ents, despite frequent rows both internally and with the executive,
have succeeded in both lining the Union coffers to a considerable
extent and providing high class entertainment. Whether in the present
state of the Union finances Ents should aim to make a profit is
debatable. I hope that when the fee increase comes through the
Union will be able to subsidise their functions since Ents, like FELIX,
is one of the few organisations from which most members of the
Union can benefit.
What about the failures? There have; as is inevitable in any such
body as IC Union, been many of these, but few have been of more than
passing concern. There has, however, been a general feeling around
of impotence and irrelevance, a feeling that the people " at the top "
had lost touch with, to coin a phrase, the grass roots of the Union and
the Union was not capable of handling their interests anyway. . -
The problem, of course, goes much deeper than personalities/and
constitutional changes. Although these,may be part of it, I think that
the increasing difficulty of degree courses and disenchantment with
those who appear to seek posts for the status they afford are more
fundamental.
The remedy is neither simple nor obvious, but it seems to me
that the biggest problem to be tackled will be in that magic word
" communication "—the two-way flow of information and opinions
between those elected to serve and those who elected them.
As this is the last editorial this session, I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all members of the FELIX staff for the work
they have put in throughout the year as well as those who have sent in
contributions, even though they may not have been printed.

Dear Sir,
We assure Messrs. Wilkinson
and Washington that nowhere in
our Phoenix articles was there the
slightest mention of the Jewish
article. Nor did we claim to
speak on behalf of any section of
opinion within or without the
Church.
We remain.
For ever yours,
"ANGELICUS."
Sir,
I have been as much delighted
by "The Anatomy of the
Church" by Angelicus — pub-
lished in your late PHOENIX
number—as deeply shocked by
the preposterous and cheap an-
swer of Messrs. J. K . Wilkinson
and C. J. Washington (publicity
officers, Cathsoc) published in the
FELIX L A T E NEWS (Ed. D.
Reeves).
What the hell do these two
honourable gentlemen mean by
the " ghetto-like " mentality of
Angelicus ? I gather they do not
know it themselves. (I do! for
the simple sad reason that I have
been confined in a Nazi ghetto
in my quality of Jew, though
Roman Catholic by faith). Do
those two simpletons dare con-
test the very words of His Holi-
ness Pope Innocent III, Saint
Jerome, Saint Ambrose and Car-
dinal Newman—words that speak
for themselves and which have
no need to be interpreted, s0
clear and unmitigated are they!
Had the Holy Fathers of the
"Mater Ecclesiae" a "ghetto-
like " mentality too ? Woe to
him who dares insult them
through Angelicus, who con-
tended himself to humbly quote
them and remind those who have
forgotten them as J.K.W. and
C.J.W., the basic truths of the
Catholic religion! Or do J.K.W.
and C J.W. think, in their simple-
mindedness, that heaven and hell
are " ghsttos "! After all, why
not?
O Heaven, blessed ghetto I
Long live the witty Angelicus
For, as our master, G. K. Ches-
terton so wonderfully said:
" Angels fly because they take it
lightly."

Irreverent Utterances
Sir,
On behalf of all the Muslims at
IC, I protest very strongly against
the statement attributed to Miss,
Anita Furniss in the Election,Rfto-
file. (FELIX 8th May) that " i f
the mountain won't come to Mp*&
hamed. Mohamed niust go to thef"
mountain." Such a statement is
found very offensive by all Mus-
lims as it is devoid of facts and is
aimed at casting aspersions not
only at the Prophet Muhammad
(May Allah keep him safe and
grant him peace) but at the reli-
gion of Islam also. The same
statement recently quoted in The
Times led to widespread demon-
strations in parts of the Muslim
world and the newspaper had to
apologise.
The mediaeval Christians who
fabricated this story of an attempt
by the Prophet Muhammad (may
Allah preserve him and grant him
peace) at miracles knew full well
that the story was not true. Their
argument that untruth could
justifiably be used to protect
what they believed to be the
Truth, i.e. their faith, will not be .
contended here. .What is amaz-^|
i tag is that the same slOgan is sftlf)"
being repeated almost 1,000 years
after by those who are supposed
to be much more, enlightened; and
much better educat^. It gojis
without saying that students of a
higher institution of science like
IC should appraise scientifically
the veracity OT^Gh fi^UdicOT
statements. 1 f r j $ t a o u & i ^ ^
responsible in tBfeir utterances^Bfc
the least those » are coritesnhg

A.complete withdrawal of this
statement and an apology are
therefore requested from Miss
Furniss and FELIX.

ED.—Whilst being flattered.to
be bracketed with The Times it
has never been FELIX policy to
cause offence to any section of the
College needlessly. We therefore
apologise to any people who
found the phrase offensive.
However the expression is in
very general English usage and
we are informed that a Muslim
Vice-Presidential candidate, Adolf
Hastheroudian.was present widen
the'article was written.
SAINST GREEK
HttuSAYS
Dear Sir,
I was interested to see the ar-
ticle written by Chris Lewis on
" Greece, divs of future passed."
In which he advertises Greece as
an inviting place to spend the
summer vacation. Even though
it is as beautiful as he describes
does he not -also realise the ugli-
ness of the military dictatorship
at the moment robbing the Greek
people of their own freedom?
I have recently heard Mark
Dragoumis speak at a Greek
teach-in in which he specifically
made the point about thd dangers
of spending holidays in Greece.
The military dictatorship needs
all the money it can get including
foreign currency brought in by
tourists. The situation is not ours
to interfere with, and the best way
we can not contribute to it is. by
npt Spending any money there.
If I may end with a quote from
Mr. Dragoumis '" The Greek
people will be very happy not to
see us there this summer."

Dear Sir,
For many years a grave Jewish
problem has existed in in th£
U.S.S.R. The Tsars and the
Russian Church persecuted the^
Jews. To-day, over 50 years after /
the Communist revolution, the
position of the Jewish minority in
the U.S.S.R. has again become
a matter of great concern.
The disabilities from which the
Jews in Russia suffer today are
numerous,
In the communal sphere the
Jewish minority is the only one
today which is not allowed to
have any distinct collective orga-
nisation of its own, either cul-
tural or religious.
The possibility of maintaining
regular contact between, for in-
stance, the Jewish communities in
Moscow and Kiev is denied to
them. Even in Tsarist days regu-
lar meetings were allowed. How-
ever non-Jewish minorities and
religious, groups do not suffer
from similar restrictions.
In the cultural and religious
spheres the restrictions in exist-
ence are of a shattering nature.
There is not a single Jewish
school. Jews are denied ffie op-
portunity to serve in the Russian
diplomatic service. The hierarchy
of the Communist party too is
practically free from Jews.
Officially the number of Jews
in the Soviet Union is given as
about 2,268,000. Students of Rus-
sian statistics suggest that the
figure is well within the region of
3,000,000: About half a million
Jews have openly declared them-
selves as the element which per-
sists in using Yiddish as their
mother tongue. There, is no school
Ja Russia in which Yiddish is
tigight. Other minorrpS ha«e
schools which teach thefr natiBinal
language. ~w
The Jewish religion has been
singled out for special treatment;
The baking of Matzos—un-
leavened bread—was forbidden
for some years. Many antisemi-
tic books are published the most
crude being "Judaism Without
Embellishment" by T. K .
Kitchko, published under the
auspices of " The Ukranian
Academy For Sciences "; this was
eventually withdrawn after being
denounced by the Western Com-
munists, among others. Kitchko,
who at the time was dismissed
has recently been reinstated and
awarded the "Diploma of Honour
of the Supreme Soviet of the
Ukraine."
Synagogues have continually
been closed. In 1953 the official
number was 450, in 1963 it wajf
97 and the current unofficial esti"
mate is 62.
The Jewish community, unlike
other religious minorities, is not
allowed to maintain contacts with
world bodies. The Russian Or-
thodox Church, for instance, is a
member of the World Council of
Churches and has permanent
representatives in Geneva. Even
the small number of Buddists are
in a better position than the Jews.
To give one more example: —
some half million Baptists in the
U.S.S.R. have about 5,000
churches and chapels. This means
one church for every 100 wor-

shippers. In the case of the Jews
there is One synagogue for every
48,000 worshippers. There are
Jewish communities in, the
U.S.S.R. today numbering be-
tween thirty and forty thousand
people without a single synagogue
left open for worship.
There are still many Jewish
families split by the Second World
War. The Soviet government has
done little to help them be re-
united. During a visit to Park
(9th December 1966) Mr. Kosy",
gin said, " As far as concerns the
reunification of families, if certain
families desire to be reunited, or
to leave the Soviet Union, the
door is open to them, and in this
respect there is no problem." Mr.
Kosygin's statement,was reprinted
in "Izvestia." However this
statement was later played down;
after June f967 the Soviet au-
thorities stopped most Jewish
emigration.
Recently* the Soviet authorities
have substituted the word Zionist
for Jew in their antisemitic propa-
ganda thus trying to avoid
western criticism of antisemitism
in the U.S.S.R. "Komsomol-
skaya Pravda " states, quoting a
reliable foreign source, " The
Zionist lawyers comprise about
70 per cent of all the American
lawyers; the physicists, including
those engaged in secret work on
the preparation of weapons for
mass destruction, comprise 69 per
cent and the industrialists more
than 43 per cent." The actual
source, which turns out to have
been written in Cairo by a Naz4
fugitive states, " The proof of the
high position attained by Jews in
American Society is apparent
from the following list compiled
from data published in 1950::
Lawyers—70 per cent; Physicians
—69 per cent; Merchants—77
per cent; Industrialists—49 per
cent; Labourers—2 per cent;
Farmers—1 per cent." Looking
at these two versions we can see
that present day Russian anti-
semitic propaganda is worse than
Nazi propaganda.
This Soviet propaganda makes
Jews appear as the enemies of the;
world. It is designed to forcibly
eliminate the identity of the
Jewish community in the U.S.S.R.
The Jewish minority is being
denied its basic human rights and
is in danger of disappearing as a
national and religious entity.
A world-wide student campaign
; is being carried out on their be-
half. Anyone who is interested
or desires to help should contact
