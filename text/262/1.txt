RCS VOTING
ASHAMBLES
After one of the biggest electoral mix-ups for many years RCS
Union now finds itself without a President for next year, and. one
of tl._ candidates for Secretary, Maria Wallis, withdrawing the day
before the election because she would not have the support of a
President.
In a joint letter to the present President, Bob Mackman, the two
nominees, Roger Webb and Anita Furniss withdrew their candi-
dature because they were unhappy about the circumstances of the
first poll and did not think Monday's ballot would have been repre-
sentative since few people* would be about. 1
RCS Union has had to poll again for the posts of President and
Vice-President. As there were no nominations the fust time foe
Secretary, the nomination papers were put up again and Monday's
elections included this post.
The trouble erupted at the RCS AGM on Tuesday 14th with ac-
cusations of inconsistencies in the ballot held the day before for the
presidency and vice-presidency of the Union. After a marathon two
and a half-hour meeting, surely one of the longest and stormiest for
many years, it was decided that because of the accusation and the
closeness of the vote a new ballot would be taken (see the final result
in FELIX LATE NEWS),
The proceedings began, peaceably enough, with the hustings for
Secretary, Chris Yewlett being proposed by Tony Bailey and Maria
Wallis by Jon Shields (results again in L A T E NEWS). After this,
proposal speeches and a vote for Assistant Secretary in which Penny
Walters beat Paddy Sterndale, this year's Queen of Jez. Then tb4
elections for RCS Ents Committee.
Now, after the lull—the storm.
Pat Haxell accused the people run-
ning the Chemistry section of the
previous day's ballot of keeping
a record of the direction in which
the vote was going and of letting
people know who had voted
which way. Les Ebdon followed
this up with complaints of a
complete lack of privacy for the
voters when casting their votes,
and objections to candidates being
ever-present at the ballot tables.
There were also complaints that
Mackman had let slip the election
results in the bar the night before
the A G M , for which Mackman
later apologised.
Missing Votes
More serious were doubts
about whether the Botany De-
partment had been disenfran-
chised or not. It was established
that some Botanists had voted in
the Chemistry box, some had
(perhaps) voted in the Zoology
department and it was just pos-
sible that some even voted in
Botany itself. Add to this the fact"
that neither Bob Mackman nor
Mike Tait, who helped with the
count, could be certain whether
any or all of the Botany votes
were counted and it becomes ap-
parent just how much of a mess
the organization of the polling
was!
Frayed Tempers
During the bickering Martin
Lack had attempted to introduce
a procedural motion to move on
to other busines and Mackman
handed over chairmanship of the
meeting to Vice-President Mike
Tait and tried to answer Haxell's
and Ebdon's charges. In the end,
Andy Keenan, Chemistry rep, was
called to defend the organisation
of the Chemistry ballot which he
seemed unable to do. Mackman
interupted the discussion several
times, trying to say that the vote
should stand. Mike Tait did his
best to keep the heat down and
tempers from fraying. Then, at
last, some measure of sanity-
Malcolm Duckett proposing the
obvious course of a new ballot.
Following came a huddle of the
politicians, with Martin Lack still
trying to insist on his motion to
announce the results and move on
to the next business, and everyone
trying to work their way through
a mess of regulations and decide
what was to be done.
Finally the huddle, looking
now like an American Football
tactics discussion, broke up and
Chris Kent spoke the magic num-
bers : " I formally propose that a
new ballot be taken . . . " A l l
hell let loose againf Martin Bland
opposing the decision in front of
an unsympathetic Union, two
eminently sensible speeches in
favour of a new ballot from Frank
Fuchs and Mrs. Judy Poe and
Bob Mackman coming to the end
of his tether, saying that a new
ballot should be carried out. A
paper vote agreed, evidently by a
large majority. So democracy
won and the new ballot for Presi-
dent and Vice-President was held
on Monday along with the ballot
for Secretary (once again see
L A T E NEWS for results).
After all this excitement, the
rest of the meeting dissolved into
anticlimax. The usual farce of
finding people to fill all positions
not already filled and the presen-
tation of social colours and gene-
ral awards. The adjournment
(without a Kangela) until yester-
day.
At the time of going to press
it seems unlikely that a President
will be elected until next session.
Andy Keenan has since resigned
Finally, FELIX information on
the first ballot is that Rog Webb
beat Anita Furniss for President
by about 50 votes, with Peter
Dolwin scraping through by 7
votes from Adolf Hashteroudian
for the Vice-Presidency.

President's D & D
The President's Dinner and
Dance on Friday, 21st June, the
last day of term, will this year
have its benefits spread more
evenly over the participants. A
smaller dinner than last year's
marathon (which had to have a
break during the seven courses to
give people a chance to recover)
will be attended by less ex-officio
people {e.g. Council members)
and more invitations will go to
club chairmen.
For those getting dance only in-
vitations a buffet supper will be
included and about 70. of these
will be on sale soon at £l double,
to cover the cost of the food.
Dancing will be from 9 till 3 to
the Don Brewer Quintet (who
played at the May Ball) and a dis-
cotheque. There will also be a
cabaret, details of which have not
yet been released.
Dress will, of course, be for-
mal.

E X P L O S I O N
Keith Guy, Chairman of Ents, v is injured when part of his
apparatus in Chem Eng exploded last Wednesday afternoon.
He received fairly severe burns to his face and arms from hot
oil and mercury vapour, and was rushed to hospital where he is
making good progress. He will probably be in for another week.
Dr. G . Saville, and two other people from Chem Eng, who
helped the swarms of firemen who descended immediately after the
explosion, were also treated for inhaling mercury vapour and were
detained for a few days.
The cause of the accident is not yet known but an inquiry is
being conducted.
F E L I X wishes Keith, who was married only eight weeks ago, a
speedy recovery. .
r r v n n rts Dermott
L U K K for Guilds
At the Guilds AGM last
Thursday Dermott Corr was
elected next year's President %y
a substantial majority over Bob
Pine, the threat of a massive vote
for the latter from Civ Eng being
more than balanced bjf Dennott's
Chem Eng votes.
The fiew Vice-President is
Frank Ccldwell, Secretary Dave
Cox, Guilds rep on Council Helen
Rtiigs, C C rap Rog Guy, Hon
Jfun Tres Dave Foster and Publi-
city Officer JuMan Browaridge.
In his report of the year Chris
O'Donnell, retiring President, said
that this had been a most success-
ful year for Guilds. They had
won every sports cup there was
for them to win and had made
a contribution of £1,600 to Car-
nival, £600 of this coming from
Mech Eng 1.
An election for ICWA Girl of
the Year was contested by five,
nominees, four of them, amaz-
ingly enough, being women, and
three of these even being from
Guilds. The winner was the fifth
contestant, lovable, cuddly Dick
James.
Union General Awards were
conferred on Chris O'Donnell
(ex-oflcio), Paul Bradley, Secre-
tary, Dick James, Vice-President,
Ian Jarvis, Mech Eng 1 re.p, and?
Stuart Senior, Publicity Officer.
The meeting closed with Der-
mott Corr being installed as Presi-
dent, given his robe, chain and
sceptre.of office. He just about
managed to lift the 52-pound,
greased (for the occasion) Span-
Is- tad, narrowly avoiding burst-
ing h blood vessel, lived to utter
" J $tmt care if I lose that thing
fa; t, w^ole.feloody year."
