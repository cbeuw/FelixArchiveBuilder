Ray Phillips counts his lock.
UGM IN
BUSINESS
At last the massive publicity effort paid off. A quorum was
eventually reached for the twice adjourned IC Union Meeting and it
also got through some useful business.
When the meeting opened almost on time there could have been
few more than 30 people in the Concert Hall as President Phillips
proposed his constitutional motion for the second time to admit
" disguised students " into the Union, which was passed unopposed
and with no-one challenging the quorum. By now there were about
100 students present and Bob Mackman moved the second reading of
his motion to elect the External Affiairs and Welfare Officers and the
U L U agent from the Union floor at the A G M , and to make the first
two officers of the Union, sitting on Council and heading their own
sub-committees.
Quorum
With the audience reaching the
staggering number of 150 Mike
Edwards challenged the quorum
(need it be added successfully?)
and Phillips adjourned the meet-
ing for ten minutes while com-
mercials for the Silwood, Ball,
Carnival Fete, Sports Day and
Mines (for those who would like
to change from RCS or Guilds)
were given.
On reopening the meeting was
still without a quorum but no-
one challenged it, so Andy Jordan
could propose that we affiliate to
the Co-ordinating Committee for
Overseas Students which was
again not opposed. Still not quite
a quorum so Phillips asked for
questions and was asked by Pete
Dolwin about Mike. Phillips
replied that it was hoped that
Mike would shortly be restored
to his rightful place on his plinth,
although he has not yet been re-
covered from Kings.
Another adjournment, five
minutes this time, and at last the
magic figure of 300 was reached.
The real business could be done.
Rory Redmayne proposed his
well-publicised motion to abolish
UGM's (Union General Meet-
ings) which, after some lively
speeches was soundly defeated al-
though large numbers abstained
in the words of Mike Edwards
" to show the opposition the
idea of the motion, but to register
disapproval with Union meetings
this year."
Walkout
As Malcolm Duckett got up to
speak on Derek Boothman's mo-
tion more or less revising the
Union constitution he was faced
with a walk-out of about 50
people. As it was five to two it is
possible that this was due to lec-
tures, but more likely it was an
attempt to block the motion.
Duckett instead asked that a re-
quest by the assembled individuals
that Council be asked to set up
a sub-committee to revise the
constitution. This was passed
overwhelmingly.
The meeting closed with a
question about beer prices and
one on the newspapers in the
Lower Lounge.

COUNCIL CRACKS
DOWN ON STOATS
In yet another insipid Council
meeting last Monday week.
Council took three hours to
thrash out the following momen-
tous decisions.
Stoats Club
They decided that Stoats Club
are to be permitted to hold their
dinner this term }n spite of the
mess and numerous complaints
of revolting behaviour after last
term's dinner. However, after
the dinner they will have no extra
privileges and will have to leave
the Union by 11.30. No bartels
of beer will be sold to them and
the reading room and senior
common room, where they have
previously remained in a besotten
state until 2 a.m., are to be
locked.
Southside Bar
Southside bar is to be given
an overhaul. New chairs are to
be installed and a new carpet
will be laid over the vac, and
the marble underneath the bar
will be extended by 1^ ft. to pre-
vent the wear which has neces-
sitated the early replacement of
the present carpet. The old car-
pet will be used to cover ICWA's
new carpet when the ICWA
lounge is used for parties.
PG Lounge ?
Vinod Garga, the overseas
students rep proposed that there
should be a lounge in the Union
specifically for .use by P.G.s. It
was pointed out that this was
contrary to the policy of integra-
tion-of UGs and PCs at IC and
that PGs were honorary mem-
bers of the SCR during the vac
and could use this then.
Vinod suggested that an appli-
cation for block membership on
behalf of all overseas students
should be made to the Inter-
national Students House in Rus-
sell Square. Vinod is to investi-
gate the support this would have
from overseas students, and Ray
Phillips is to look into the possi-
bility of a block membership.
J U R G O
The Joint Union-Rector's Gov-
erning Committee which is to sit
for the first time this term—old
JUDCO + Rector=new JURGO
—was discussed. It decides the
representation of Council on var-
ious external committees such as
parking, medical health and
general studies committees.
Standing Orders
Council approved the standing
orders for Union meetings which
nad been drawn up using the
RCS standing orders as a guide.
It is to be hoped that after the
fiasco at the RCS meeting a week
ago that i C manages the practice
of their standing orders a little
better.
Welfare and
External Affairs
The constitutions for the Wel-
fare and External Affairs Com-
mittees were passed and the addi-
tion of these two officers to coun-
cil is to go before the next Gov-
ernor's meeting for approval on
June 12th. The Welfare and Ex-
ternal Affairs Officers are to be
elected at the Union A G M on
May 31st, subject to ratification
of the constitution. If the gov-
erning body will delegate this
ratification to a sub-committee
sitting before June 10th then
these offksrs will hold voting
positions at the Joint Council on
June 10th, when this year's and
next year's Council combine to
elect the next President and
Secretary of IC. If not, they will
not become voting members until
two days after the Joint Council
Meeting.
Robb
After the main business had
been concluded, with little of the
petty wrangling characteristic of
most council meetings, Peter
Jtuhemann started a discussion
m the work of the Union Secre-
tary. Much strong feeling was
aired about the way Mrs. Robin-
son carried out her highly com-
plex and responsible job. Per-
sonality clashes were blamed as
usual, and Council made no de-
cisions.
E M E R G E N C Y B L E E D
R E A C H E S C L I M A X
The College emergency blood
doning scheme will cease opera-
tion on June 1st, so that there
can be no possible interference
with examination performance.
By that time the vast majority of
the 150 hall residents on the
scheme will "have given blood for
use at the ,National Heart Hos-
pital. The National Heart Hos-
pital was the scene two, weeks
ago of Britains first heart trans-
plant. Some blood given by IC's
Emergency donors was used for
this operation.
The scheme will be set up at
the beginning of next session to
continue supplying the hospital
with fresh blood at short notice.
Dr. Patterson, the doctor-in
charge Of obtaining blood for the
operation performed at the hos-
pital, expresses his thanks to all
those who have turned out to give
blood on this scheme and hopes
that next session a similar num-
ber of students will volunteer to
help.
For those not on the Emer-
gency scheme it is still not too
late to sign up for the latest ses-
sion which continues to-day and
to-morrow. It only takes about
half an hour and there are free
biscuits and tea. Sign up in the
Union foyer.
True
Story
Dept.
Ever hot on the trail of news,
Felix ace reporter Scoop Ham-
features found himself in a dark
book-filled room near Beit Hall
last week. Suddenly a soft voice
at his shoulder startled him.
" Want to buy feeltEy Parade
magazine?"
" SMUT." said Scoop, adjust-
ing'his Lady Dartmouth mous-
tache.
"Smut, Shmut; whaddo I
care?"
" Put away your weapon " said
the mysterious V., "there is no
mystery. This magazine has been
delivered here by mistake instead
of to a bookstall on the embank-
ment."
Scoop shuffled out, a broken
man. No 2H pencils, either.
Sports
Day
This year's Sports Day should
ba the best one for many years.
It is being held at Motspur Park,
the University Sports Ground. A
laTge number of staff are expected
to attend, thanks to a joint letter
sent out by the Rector and Ray
Phillips. As well as all the usual
sort of races between the con-
stituent colleges there will be the
Presidents Race, in which your
hydrophobic President will act-
ually be seen taking part in Friv-
olous (and probably degrading)
Activity. " An ace occasion "
was how Ray Phillips described
the afternoon.
F R E E coaches will leave the
Union at 2 p.m. on Saturday and
teas will be provided. The prizes
will be presented by Lord Penney.
Pam Horrocks.
