IC won the following U L U
championships this season :
Soccer (2nd XI)
Cross Country
Swimming
Rugger Sevens (came
1st and 2nd)
Head of the River
Ladies Hockey
Mixed Hockey
Need I say more! This indeed
seems to be one area where the
Union's monies are effectively
spent.
With the coming of the new
sports centre by next session
there is likely to be a sudden
jump in the level of sporting
activity generally and in particu-
lar th-; ri-le, squash and swim-
ming clubs may well expand out
of all proportion as the new
centre will provide a swimming
pool, a 30 yd. small bore rifle
range, 4 squash courts, a weight-
lifting room and the necessary
changing rooms.

When we last inquired the
college was continuing to func-
tion, with the new principal be-
ing apparently pro-student, un-
like last year when he was pro-
Rector.
'6 8 WAS D E A D
L O N G LIVE '68
by R o r y R e d m a y n e
UBLIClTY—This has been perhaps the most
widely discussed and least widely effective item
in the Union conversation rota this year. Jointly
awarded the clich6 of the year prize with " Who is
Ray Phillips anyway" and " M J L to organise," it
has at least been realised that in a body as diffuse (or dilute?) as
ICU good publicity is essential. What has failed to strike home is
that, good publicity " is not posters; it is telling people. Posters
may be a means to an end, but they are certainly not the end. Much
more must be done in the field of internal communication. People
have been muttering " year reps," " Constituent colleges," " FELIX "
for just about the whole session and have almost unanimously failed
to properly use any of these media for communication purposes. If
interest in the affairs of the Union is to be revitalised (and some of
their affairs are both relevant and interesting, believe it or not), then
the most important concept is that people must not only be told that
" the affairs of the Union are interesting " but must also be precisely
told what these interesting affairs are and how they affect the Union.
Further this must be done on a personal level from the top down.
So please next year's Exec, whoever you may be Lowin, tell us what is
happening; tell us when and why it is happening—then perhaps
we will take a more active interest and offer less destructive criticism.
o
USES—that is Student 'Ouses! Of the few real ad-
vances this session the progress made with the
establishment of student houses has perhaps been the
most needed. Initiated last session by Pete Finch and
Rex Lowin this project has, through the work of Ray
Phillips and Bob Fryer, made fairly swift progress under the guidance
of the Governing Body; so that now we have not only established the
principle and system of this form of hall/lodging but have also
obtained two of " your actual" houses which will give almost 200
people cheap communal board next year.
L
IAISON: While all around us students are demanding
representation on the governing bodies, ICU
suggested it in its usual unreactionary way (or was it
well mannered and civilised) that perhaps a voice on
the,B.o.G. might be a good idea. The Rector, received
this in a manner that we are, I think, coming to recognise as charac-
teristic. Having made a thorough survey of the B.o.G. minutes, he
produced a report for Council showing just how little of their business
was directly relevant to students, and also pointed out that direct
representation would anyway be of no use to the Union as the affairs
of the Board of Governors meetings are confidential and so the student
representative could not report back to discuss the business within the
Union. However, by way of an alternative the Rector suggested
regular meetings of interested parties at which topics of mutual
interest could be discussed. From this has emerged JURGO (Joint
Union, Rector, Governors' committee). This committee, which is
composed of ICU Council, the Rector, Pro Rector, the Deans,
Registrar, College Secretary and three members of the B.o.G., will
meet termly and is expected to discuss such matters as college develop-
ment, courses and so on. As an instrument for liaison this should
prove invaluable and great credit should go to those involved in its
instigation.
On a more day to day level liaison has been one of the great
stumbling blocks this year. Although Ray Phillips has set a new high
in liaison upwards—Union-College Admin—he has also set a new low
downwards—President-rest of Union. That there should be the internal
situation of the President and the Union, instead of the President of
the Union, is sad; but if it does exist then the basic requirement of a
working arrangement is first class two-way liaison. There wasn't and
much of the " why?" of this brings me onto " I;"
I
NTOLERANCE : There has been an almost vicious
atmosphere of intolerance throughout the Exec,
Council and the Union administration generally for a
lot of this session; and there can be nothing less con-
ducive to good liaison than an intolerance of one's
colleagues. Perhaps new faces and new effort next session will cure
what appears to be essentially an internal problem.
T W O D D L E — I refer of course to the proceedings of
most of the business of this year's few quorate Union
meetings!
NS1PID—This is how I would describe this year's
Council. As a body they appear to have achieved
little because individuals have repeatedly drawn back
from carrying through in public views they express
in private. This seems to have lead to a great frus-
tration, which has been intensified by everyone's failure to recognise
until after the event the cunning P.D.C.T.P.—Phillips Disguised
Committee Trampling Ploy!
O N S T I T U T I O N : Making what use we could of the
few Union meetings that crawled into quoracy, we've
succeeded to constitutionally recognise the External
Affairs and Welfare committees and failed to elect
our future Presidents by a plebisite or to do away
With Union meetings.
S is either for the " S***iest S*** I've ever seen " as
Robb described this year's Council or on a less earthy
note for " stirring;" this continues to be the preroga-
tive of those of us whose main interests are the
Union's affairs and continues to be as ineffective as
usual.
