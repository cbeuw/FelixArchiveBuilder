IT'S THE FREE LEFT'
BLACK
DWARF
If you study the papers on the
news-stands there are papers like
the Telegraph which are labelled
" Right Wing " and those like the
Mirror which are generally con-
sidered to be " Left Wing." There
is a group of left-wingers who
consider this latter classification
to be false and so are about to
launch a " new " and " free "
paper of the Left.
To be quite accurate, this is
not a new paper but a revived
one, for its name—"The Black
Dwarf "—is the name of a paper
which died 140 years ago. This
paper was produced by a printer
called Tom Wooler whose edi-
torial policy was very close to the
declared policy of the board of
the revived: " Black Dwarf." He
wanted the paper to " lead a con-
sistent struggle for the day-to-day
interests of the working masses
and ward off all attacks on their
standard of living" and "to make
use of every partial demand to ex-
plain the necessity of revolution
and show the impossibility of
even a moderately serious and
lasting, let alone fundamental, im-
provement, so long as the powei
of capital is maintained."
Those aims seem so stringent
that it is a wonder that the paper
can appear at all. Furthermore,
when they say that they do not
want a readership for the adver-
tisers' benefit the financial
strength of the |paper must be
questionable. Much of the initial
money has come from donations
from the more prosperous capi-
talist-hating left-wingers and from
advance subscriptions. The Edi-
torial Board have possibly con-
tributed considerably.
The best known personality
connected with The Black Dwarf
is, as William Hardcastle puts it
" our friend from Grosvenor
Square, Tariq A l i " whose politi-
cal beliefs seem to be embodied
in this paper. It is published from
the office of a literary agent, Clive
Goodwin, who made a name for
himself by publicly admitting that
he -moked cannabis. He admits
thai the paper tends to be destruc-
tive rather than constructive but
feels that this is partially the pre-
rogative of a " free " newspaper.
He tends to despise what he
labels as " the un-free press," for
it dos not write about real poli-
tics and real news and only puts
forward one side of the argument
in a strike (and that, comrades, is
never the workers' side).
The " startling " revelations to
be made by the Black Dwarf will
possibly lead them into libel ac-
tion unless they follow the course
of Tom Wooler who, on being
charged with writing seditious
and libellous material, explained
that he had not written a word, he
had simply set it up in print.
The name "Black Dwarf" is
very ill-advised as almost inevit-
ably it will get associated with
the " Black Power " movement.
Many problems are almost non-
existent until they are put forward
and people start looking for them
and so while the paper, with a
hoped-for circulation of 25,000,
expressly denies any intention of
causing unrest it would be naive
to expect this aim to be achieved,
holding the radical views it does.
Anyone who believes " Axel
Springer today, Cecil King to-
morrow" will probably agree with
what the Black Dwarf has to say,
but you do not have to be as
virtuous as Lord Beeching thinks
IC students are to find the Black
Dwarf a little too much to
stomach. Several people do not
mind attending a Trafalgar
Square rally from time to time,
but one a fortnight is a little too
much.

WHAT HAPPENS IN 69?
At Guilds Open Day, last au-
tumn, people crowded into E E
101 to gaze at the computer. It
looked so sleek and modern that
they did not realise that they
were looking at a computer's
equivalent of a tank engine. It
works all right but it's just too
small.
The main problem is that the
amount of work it is required to
do is doubling each year, and
with an increasing number of re-
reach projects involving com-
puter work this rate is going to be
maintained for the foreseeable
future.
Some years ago I B M loaned
the college its then most power-
ful computer, the 7090, with an
aotfifional 1401. Very recently
this was made into an IBM 7094
Mk II and an IBM 1460 arrived
to help deal with the increasing
work load. Originally, IC could
only use the computer for a third
of the time, but now this has
been more than doubled. Even
so, this million pound mass of
wires is stretched to full capacity.
IC's agreement with IBM termi-
nates in 1969 and they will then
probably want it back.
Luckily there will not bft a
blank in computing facilities
after that for the University of
London is lashing out 1^ million
on a CDC 6600 with a direct link
to I.C. It will be available for
college use for about half the
time. Sadly the total capacity of
mis machine is only four times
ours so by 1970 it will already
be overloaded.
At present there seems to be
no plan for purchasing a new
computer—delivery time is about
two years—so what is going to
happen in 1970 is anyone's guess.
Somebody has been incredibly
short-sighted because nowadays
it is not high speed lifts and hot
and cold running water in every
room that attracts scientists; it
is computing facilities. With-
out rapid planning in the next
few months, Imperial College
with all its claims about being
at the forefront of scientific
learning is going to be lost far
behind in the technological race
it is supposed to be leading.
It's die new-look Albert Hall! Startling reveiatioas of a BrMf*
Railways takeover in the next amazing issue.
BEITER BIT OF
1E%t Albert Hall
To over 95 per cent of the
students at Imperial College, Sil-
wood will just be a name on the
notice board associated with
Touchstone activities. But the
converse is also true, that the
students at Silwood perhaps
know South Kensington better as
the home of the Albert Hall
than of the vast I.C. metropolis.
This lack of knowledge about
Silwood, only 30 miles away, is,
I suppose, not unnatural, due to
the minority of students working
there — at the moment approxi-
mately 80 in toto. Since the
resident students are all post-
graduates, involved in deep(?) re-
search work, they show little in-
terest in the affairs of South
Kensington, and the main part
of the Union and are conse-
quently out of touch.
The College Field Station
which was originally established
in Slough, in the buildings now
occupied by the Government Pest
Infestation Laboratory, moved
to its premises at Silwood Park
after the war, in 1947. Basically
it is the field station for the Zoo-
logy Department, with over half
the zoologists specialising in en-
tomology. .The'Botany Depart-
ment has also a large section at
the Field Station and this appears
to be gradually increasing. For
four years, the University of
London Reactor has been opera-
tional at Silwood, and this is the
scene of much activity at the mo-
ment, with an extension lab.
being built. Meteorology and
Geophysics have small units on
the Field Station, but with few
personnel. Annual invasions of
Civil and Mechanical Engineers
occur and various other courses
•bow up from time to time.
THIS IS SILWOOD
The Uaion at Silwood is repre-
sented by a small Silwood Park
Committee, the chairman of
which at:
present is that flam-
boyant figure, Mr. Terry Price.
This committee looks after the
day-to-day running of the sports,
social and other facilities and is
intimately bound up with the run-
ing of the Hostel. The Hostel at
Silwood is situated in the main
house and adjacent huts, there
being a unique situation where
some people actually live in
rooms above the laboratories in
which they work. Compared to
Mooney's, the food at Silwood is
of .a decidedly better quality, but
differs in that there is no choice
of mejal unless you have a par-
ticular dislike for a certain food-
stuff and tell Paddy, the chef, be-
forehand. Paddy on ftvo or three
occasions of the year really goes
to town and provides a tremen-
dous spread at Dinner-in-Hal!
and Summer Ball. Apart from
the students living in Hostel, a
large proportion live out—^either
by choice or of necessity. There
is no accommodation for married
students and since everyone is
postgraduate, approximately one-
third are married. They find
accommodation in the notorious
"Blue Star," or various abodes,
as far away as London.
Another outstanding feature of
the Field Station community is
its internationality. Overseas
students comprise over half the
population and 30 nationalities
are currently represented at Sil-
wood. The good harmony and
generally friendly relations be-
tween races are features that
would gladden the heart of any
U N official. Coupled with this
harmonious atmosphere is a very
good staff-student relationship,
which is seldom to be found at
South Kensington. Of course,
this is inevitable in such a small
community and is evidenced by
the many staff patronising Sil-
wood dances.
To conclude, though Silwood
is an isolated community which
superficially appears to shun
strangers, it will be found, on
further examination, that Sil-
woodians are no more different
from, and no less interesting than
South Kensingtonites, but, if
anything, are more friendly, due
to this very factor of isolation.
This year is the 21st Anniver-
sary of the Colleges' takeover of
Silwood. To celebrate, an anni-
versary Ball is being held there
on June 7th from 9—4.30 with
two Band, plus West Indian
Steel Band. Free champagne
toast. Appjyibefore Friday to
B. C. Folland, Silwood Park.

The Royal Albert Hall, th 1
monstrosity familiar to most ob-
servant people frequenting t!
area, was probably some old
roundhouse transported stone by
stone from America and rebuilt
as per London Bridge. There are
various opinions expressed on its
visual properties : " Gee tha
swell." (Let's hope it doesn't)
more usually "Eurugh!" Sor
people like it, notably Americ. •
and the resident BBC sound
gineers who like the acous c
properties which, with a bit of
diddling, can help produce st- -o
recordings second to none. Bat
most people say it sounds good;
that it, except for a few Beit
residents. Of course it has its
uses. There's boxing most nights
and the L.S.O. most other nights
with Jimi Hendrix or w h w "
thrown in for good measure, usu-
ally with John Peel.
Not only has South Ken got
" The Alb."; its got the museums
and they draw the crowds. That's
bad. But the crowds draw the
ice-cream vendors and that's
wicked. However, compared with
the coaches the mausoleum at-
tracts they're a godsend.
The other night the Queen gave
a live performance and as usual
the masses flocked to see her. The
Brownies, the Lifeboys, the old
women from Clacton, the cars
and worst 'of all the coaches-^-
coaches packed with senile dod-
dering pensioners out for a thrill;
coaches packed with disinterested
kids and their equally noisy
parents; luxury coaches packed
with stale air and rubbish.
They all turned up.
That night Liz drew over 35
charabancs into Prince Consort
Road. They triple parked, they
quadruple parked. Four huge'
glass bulls in line abreast thwart-
ing all traffic flow. They bonked,
the cars bonked, the people
wailed, screamed and cater-
wauled. Prince Consort Road
was packed so tight not another
vehicle could have entered. It
was like a mad fair-ground. Have
you ever tried writing lab reports
at a fair, lei alone a mad fair. I

sore back to the Yanks.
