iitoriA.R.Bray C i r c u l a t i o n : 1200.
A recent correspondent i n the L e t t e r s column
advocated a return to the use o f student academic
gowns, h i s idea being the c o n s t r u c t i o n o f an
atmosphere o f l e a r n i n g ; o f belonging; o f a
U n i v e r s i t y . He was j o k i n g , but there i s a
fundamental t r u t h behind the joke.
Our Post Graduates are notorious f o r t h e i r lack of
interest i n Union a f f a i r s . Kost of them know the
"well-bred club" atmosphere which exists at some older
u n i v e r s i t i e s . There are places which have professors no
better than ours, laboratories snd theatres no less a n t i -
quated, and yet which turn out men much more suited t o
taking top places i n industry. The answer? Atmosphere.
If the present scheme f o r adding two f l o o r s
to the Union i s c a r r i e d out, we s h a l l be s i t t i n g
p r e t t y . There w i l l be plenty o f room f o r a l l
a c t i v i t i e s ; room f o r calm r e f l e c t i o n , and room
for companionship. Long ago, i t was r e a l i s e d
that our Union, b u i l t f o r 6 0 0 , was f a r too small
for the present 1600; and i t was decided that i t
should be increased. And i t appears that those
long planned i n c r e a s e s are to occur now. How
lucky we are'.
But when we remember that we are t o double
our student p o p u l a t i o n , things look a l i t t l e
d i f f e r e n t . The scheme which w i l l add two f l o o r s
above the gym, cannot include much e x t r a h o s t e l
accommodation, and while i t might have s a t i s f i e d
1500, i t w i l l be hopeless f o r 3000.
Let us look ahead. I t i s w e l l known that
those who l i v e i n the H o s t e l have s o c i a l advanta-
ges denied to the rest o f us. I f our present
H o s t e l r e s i d e n t s were a l l t o disappear o v e r n i g h t ,
s o c i a l and a t h l e t i c l i f e i n the Union would d i e ;
for those people are the cream o f 1.0. Many o f
them are much the same as the r e s t o f us, but they
have developed and matured i n the s t i m u l a t i n g con-
d i t i o n s o f a l i f e which i n v o l v e s constant close
contact with other i n t e l l i g e n t and t a s t e f u l people,
The s o l u t i o n : the only s o l u t i o n which can be
s e r i o u s l y considered i n the l i g h t o f the Govern-
ment's heart-cry f o r e n l i g h t e n e d leaders o f Tech-
nology, i s that there should be a large h o s t e l i n
a s i n g l e u n i t , w i t h a s i n g l e compact Union c l o s e l y
interwoven i n t o i t . Every student should be able
to spend at l e a s t one, and p r e f e r a b l y two years
in that p l a c e : that place which may come to be a
r e a l U n i v e r s i t y .
Now i s the time f o r a c t i o n . I f we add our
two p a l t r y f l o o r s , spending a large sum on a
scheme which i s from the s t a r t obviously inade-
quate, then we severely .jeopardise our chance o f
being able t o b u i l d a new Union l a t e r .
The T e c h n o l o g i c a l U n i v e r s i t y i s not an i d l e
opium dream. I t has a greater chance now o f
coming i n t o being than i t ever had b e f o r e . B u t ,
at the h e a r t , i t does not l i e s o l e l y i n s p o t l e s s
and up-to-date l a b o r a t o r i e s . I t can only be
founded on a n u c l e u s , a c o l o s s a l n u c l e u s , o f
i n t e l l i g e n t , broad minded U n i v e r s i t y men; men
whose science degrees are not the o b j e c t s o f
scorn from veneered Oxford men. I t cannot r e s t
on t i n t r a y s , and a gabbling r e f e c t o r y , and over-
crowded lounges, and long tube r i d e s , and i s o l a t i o n
from f e l l o w students, and a l l the other t h i n g s
which combine t o make the average I.C. product
a narrow (though e f f i c i e n t , w i t h i n l i m i t s )
t e c h n i c a l sausage.
T h i s being the most important matter ever
t a c k l e d , or ever l i k e l y to be t a c k l e d by FELIX,
your views a r e , t o p * t i t m i l d l y , welcome.
A M A S C O T A T L A S T .
U.L. DEBATE
I s h a l l never understand why the f r i v o l o u s always has '
a greater a t t r a c t i o n f o r the undergraduate than the morally
or p o l i t i c a l l y important; especially when the l a t t e r d i r e c t l y
concerns h i s career.
On February 20th the motion - " I t i s better t o have
loved and l o s t - much better!" was c a r r i e d by 25 votes t o
22 with 8 abstensions, while the following week a flow of
only 20 debated "This house believes m i l i t a r y service i s not
a service t o the community." That i t was carried by 10
votes t o 2 must have been as much due t o the s i n c e r i t y and
experience the secretary of the non-conscript committee
brought t o i t s defence, as to the lack of l o g i c i n Commander
Ransorae's opposition. I t was also unfortunate f o r h i s cause,
and discourteous t o the house, f o r him t o leave during the
course of the debate, whatever the excuse-

"Herbert", our new mascot shook i t s gay plumage and
blinked i t s wicked eye f o r the f i r s t time at the I.C. Union
Meeting on the 24th February.
"Herbert", a Phoenix, named a f t e r H. G. Wells the
founder of FELIX'S contemporary i s at present 2' 6" of
v i v i d l y painted plaster. But a metamorphosis i s believed
to be imminent. "Herbert" w i l l then emerge i n h i s f i n a l
form of concrete or iluminium ; which i t w i l l be only the
Gods can t e l l (and the I.C. Rag Committee who anyway, since
the Union Meeting, must have moved t h e i r digs t o l i t . Olympus).
A l l those who have hot already seen "Herbert" are urged
to support I.C. at the U.L. Rugger Cup F i n a l on March 14th,
ihere i t i s rumoured He w i l l be g i v i n g a ceremonial " f l y
;ast", and (we hope) a Victory loop.
The other important news at the Union Meeting concern-
ed I.C.'s plans for the Coronation. The President, a f t e r
t e l l i n g us that I.C.'s a l l o c a t i o n of t i c k e t s f o r the U.L.
Coronation B a l l was only t h i r t y - f i v e , suggested that I.C.
should run t h e i r own B a l l on Coronation Day. This sugges-
tion was loudly approved. The p r o v i s i o n a l plans f o r t h i s
B a l l include dancing i n a l l four rooms, a buffet i n the
Snack Bar, and a Beer Garden i n the tennis courts.
Sports Day, on June 4th, i s t o be a general College
holiday sndit i s hoped that i t w i l l be a "Gs.la" a f f a i r ,
with Clubs and Societies running side-shows and everybody
encouraged t o "make a day o f i t " . The G l i d i n g Club hope t o
give a display. There was considerable discussion at the
meeting, on where the Sports Day Hop should be held.
Harlington, the Union and something " f l o a t i n g " between the
two, such as a boat on the River, were a l l suggested, but
f i n a l l y , as usual, the decision and arrangements were l e f t
with the Entertainments Committee. Another proposal which,
i n the words of the Minutes "was greeted with acclamation",
was that the Harlington transport on Sports Day, should be
used on the return journey f o r a Grand Tour of London.
P h i l l i p Allsopp, who i s a member of the Ayrton H a l l
Committee, announced that the serving rate there should
Improve shortly.
The President asked f o r the Union's opinion on a
strong recommendation which i s t o be sent by the President's
council of U.L., t o the University Grants Committee, asking
that college refectories are subsidized f o r meals served i n
the vacations. The Union gave t h e i r f u l l support to the
President t o vote f o r t h i s recommendation.
We are asked t o i n s e r t the following.;
