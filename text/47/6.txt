Wye College 3 pte I.e. 9 p i s .
I.C. survived t h e i r long journey into darkest Kent and
are now i n the F i n a l for the second successive year, with a
good prospect of r e t a i n i n g the Cup. Wye provided much ster-
ner opposition than that encountered i n e a r l i e r rounds, but
generally speaking IC.controlled the game and never seemed
l i k e l y t o lose. The team was not at f u l l strength because
of i n j u r i e s , but Palmer on the l e f t wing and B e l l , as hooker,
were able substitutes.
Beginning against a s l i g h t wind and a slope, I.C. soon
advanced t o t h e i r opponent's '25'. The f i r s t score came
a f t e r ten minutes when Hearn broke through and passed t o
Palmer who ran strongly t o touch down wide on the l e f t . I n
the m i d - f i e l d play which followed the b e t t e r - d r i l l e d I.C.
forwards were superior, and our backs, though not always
t a c k l i n g very f i r m l y , were able t o check the Wye threequarters.
and force them into too-frequent k i c k i n g . Just before h a l f -
time I.C. went furtherahead when Knox landed a good penalty
from about 40 yards.
The second h a l f began with a determined Wye attack, and
they sc"-ed a f t e r a high kick into our '25', which was very
poorly covered by the defence. Further attacks looked
dangerous, e s p e c i a l l y when another well-judged kick found
the full-back out of p o s i t i o n , but at t h i s c r u c i a l phase the
I.C. forwards rose t o the occassion and gradually worked play
down-field. The remaining 20 minutes were a long siege of
the Wye goal l i n e with several near-scores. At the very end
B e l l fastened on t o a strong pass from a defender and crossed
for a t r y .
On the evidence of t h i s match I.C.'s cup team i s a
strong and well-balanced side. The threequarters do not
lack penetration and the forwards are capable of putting
heavy pressure on opposing packs. The defence could w e l l
be tightened by s w i f t e r covering and heavier t a c k l i n g , but
the main thing i s t o see that an attacking p o s i t i o n ones
gained, i s f u l l y exploited by intensive and opportunist
backing-up. In the other semi-final Kings defeated Q.H.C.
and so w i l l be our opponents at "lotspur Park on March 14th.

In perfect conditions I.C. took 5th place i n the
annual Hyde Park I n v i t a t i o n Road Relay (6 x 2.75 miles)
for the Roderic H i l l Cup l a s t Saturday. A f t e r being no-
where in the f i r s t l a p , we recovered t o 12th, 10th, 8th
6th and 5th. Although we were improving our p o s i t i o n
each Hap, we were steadily losing time with respect to the
winners, L.S.E.
The lap record was lowered to 13m. 9s. by Dunkley o f
L.S.E., and both L.S.E. and B r i s t o l broke the team record.

STEPHENSON CUP
2 GUILDS
The Mines gave Guilds t h e i r worst surprise packet of the
season when they defeated Guilds on Wed. 25th February.
The score was not a true r e f l e c t i o n of the game as the
b a l l rarely l e f t the Guilds-
h a l f of the f i e l d . The shouts
and p r i c k s of t h e i r senior players f a i l e d t o rouse the
Guilds' team to any appreciable e f f o r t , while the Mines
demonstrated what a team with a w i l l can achieve against
heavy odds.

TECHNOLOGY CUP
R.C.S. GUILDS
R.C.S. made sure o f a place i n the f i n a l of the Tech. Cup
for the 4th year i n succession by defeating Guilds 1-0
on Wed. 18th February. The score suggests a close game
but i n fact R.C.S. were w e l l on top throughout and only
bad f i n i s h i n g by t h e i r forwards kept the score down. These
two teams are t o fight out the F i n a l on the 18th March when
another close struggle i s expected.
MINES GUILDS
A strong Guilds' team e a s i l y accounted for a depleted, Mines'
side on Sat. 28th February. Playing with only nine men for
a considerable time the Mines' team could make no impression
on the Guilds' defence. However, i n spite o f the odds the
Miners stuck t o t h e i r task manfully and a l l praise i s due to
those players who turned out for t h e i r College knowing that
t h e i r chances of succ-ss were small.
