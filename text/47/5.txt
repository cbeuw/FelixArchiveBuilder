V e r s i o n , American Commentary, E n g l i s h

The advertisements outside La Continentale
say something to the e f f e c t that t h i s f i l m i s
"The Greatest o f ALL Time". For myself I would
not speak o f i t with quite t h i s degree o f
enthusiasm, but i t c e r t a i n l y ranks among the
g r e a t e s t . I suppose that most people t h i n k o f
i t p r i m a r i l y as a comedy even a f t e r seeing i t ,
but from my scant knowledge of the country I
would consider i t to be a sincere c a r i c a t u r e o f
I t a l i a n v i l l a g e l i f e just a f t e r the l a t e war.
The f i l m , being a c a r i c a t u r e , the communists
do not escape c a r i c a t u r i s a t i o n . Parades, red
f l a g s , hammer and s i c k l e , and "Comrades": a l l
these f a m i l i a r symbols are s t r e s s e d , but behind
i t a l l we are shown the d i f f i c u l t i e s which they
are faced with are the good work o f improvement
that they do; so n i c e l y are a l l these aspects
balanced that the f i l m i s n e i t h e r a n t i - nor pro-
Communist i n outlook, and could not p o s s i b l y
o f f e n d anyone p o l i t i c a l l y .
And now what of the two main characters i n
the f i l m , the P r i e s t , Don C a m l l l o , and the Mayor
Reppooe? They both want to do a l l they can f o r
the improvement o f the v i l l a g e , "but i n t h e i r
own way" as the commentary says. T h i s i s not
r e a l l y so, however. As the story u n f o l d s , we
f i n d more and more that they a c t u a l l y do t h i n g s
in the same way. I f Reppone has b r i b e d some-
one to do something i t t r a n s p i r e s that Don
Camilla has b r i b e d him not t o , and the issue i s
more often than not s e t t l e d between the two with
f i s t s ; i n f a c t , we soon f i n d out that Don
Camillo i s the strongest man i n the v i l l a g e and
in communal f i g h t s u s u a l l y knock $ out "Comrades"
to a t o t a l o f a two-figures number.
I s a i d e a r l i e r that there was nothing
p o l i t i c a l l y o f f e n s i v e in the f i l m , but other points}
have been under debate on the occasions when Don
Camillo i s i n the church he seemingly discourses
with C h r i s t , u s u a l l y speaking to a c r u c i f i x ;
people of a r e l i g i o u s turn of mind may f e e l
strongly about t h i s but surely not a f t e r the pre-
face o f the f i l m which e x p l a i n s t h a t , i n r e a l i t y ,
i t i s the voice o f Don Camilla's conscience. The
f u n c t i o n o f t h i s voice i s so important, however,
that i t could hardly be dropped without the
n e c e s s i t y o f i n t r o d u c i n g another c h a r a c t e r , or
lengthening the a c t i o n . I t i s , i n e f f e c t , the
p o i n t o f i n f l u e n c e o f a t r e n d in' modern art f o r
economy of l i n e ; that i s , making one item o f your
m a t e r i a l do the work o f many.
The a c t u a l f u n c t i o n of the v o i c e i s to
e l u c i d a t e p a r t s o f the story which occur " o f f
stage" and to give us some i n s i g h t i n j o the
character of Don C a m i l l o . Another, l e s s u s e f u l ,
v o i c e , o f which the f u n c t i o n i s u n c e r t a i n , i s the
American commentary, which s l i p s i n at odd times
o f s i l e n c e to e x p l a i n p o i n t s to the audience.
Besides having an American accent, i t under-rates
one's I n t e l l i g e n c e and seemed to me unnecessary.
But we can hardly blame the producer f o r t h a t .
I advise t h i s f i l m f o r a r e a l l y amusing
evening, but also as one to be remembered

If you are honest, reliable, persistent with your
d i f f i c u l t i e s (but not such as to lose sight of your goal
by distorting the true perspective), conscious of time
(unless yon are on research), and are endowed with
commonsense, an appreciation of the virtues of simpli-
city, an orderly mind and tidy ways (which are far from
synonymous); then i f you are a proficient and i n c o r r i -
gible doodler (for thence comes much inspiration), and
habitually record on paper your mental processes i n work-
ing out problems, you may read the following paragraph.
An a b i l i t y to work with others, to pass the ball
and f o r f e i t a chance of scoring, combined with a l i t t l e
sympathy, tact, loyalty and generosity; take a l l these
Jind mix well, then what w i l l you be? You'll be an
Engineer, my son.
This was the substance of the Presidential Address
given to the Radio Society by C. E. Strong, O.B.E.,
B.A.I., M.I.E.E., a fortnight ago. The application of
engineering knowledge does not receive the attention
that i t deserves, said Mr. Strong. Then he went on to
describe, i n a speech which was never dull, the virtues
he would look for i n a man he was considering for employ-
ment. And the greatest of these i s honesty.
At the Dinner, also a success, your reporter was
struck by the high standard of the student speeches.
Altogether a good show.
O N E S M A L L S P H E R E .
This year's President of the 0. & G. Engineering Soc-
iety, Capt. Holbein, gave his Address on February 19th.
The Address was followed by the Society's Annual Dinner.
During his address on "The first few years of an
Engineer's Life", Capt. Holbein gave his advice on a career
which for him, he admitted (for the first time in public)
had" been his Life. Th& president started with a warning*
Don't be surprised i f the work you do i s not the work you
were trained for. Hany great men, Handley Page for example,
were trained for a branch of engineering different from the
one in which they gained their greatness. Anyway added
Capt. Holbein, you do not start learning to be an engineer
until you leave college. The President's main advice, which
he stressed greatly, was "Decide what you want to do"; "Hake
up your mind on your aim in l i f e , Is i t security or ad-
vantage?" Whichever you want another question should, be
answered early in your career, "Do you want to deal with
people or with things?" Capt. Holbeins other advice was more
particularly for construction engineers. Gain experience
with contractors and cultivate Accuracy. The worst crime
an engineer can commit i s . "To stumble overthe same stone
twice".
The Dinner was distinguished by some fine speeches,
not the least of which, by Student Orator Brian Walker,
had the audienoe curled up on the floor, helpless.
