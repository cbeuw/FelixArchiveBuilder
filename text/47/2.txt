P R O F I L E MR. JAMES
Mr. J?. .Â». Jaaea i s well laiown both to
students and s t a f f , e i t h e r i n h i s capacity as
L i b r a r i a n of Guilds or as Hon. Treasurer of
I.C. U.A.C.C.
In the f i r s t p o s i t i o n , t i l s helpfulness and
h i s equahle d i s p o s i t i o n , h i s astounding memory,
die Knowledge of chemistry and h i s amateur
i n t e r e s t i n w i r e l e s s and t e l e v i s i o n a i v e him
a general Knowledge i j engineering which i s
invaluable to the students, and combine to make
him an extremely popular l i b r a r i a n .
H i s s c i e n t i f i c leanings f i r s t became
apparent at a small grammar school i n Pembroke-
s h i r e , where the headmaster, a cracc shot aad an
e n t h u s i a s t i c d i s c i p l e of Isaac Walton, was very
generous i n the award of h a l f holidays on days
which promised him good sport. Unfortunately,
anyone acquainted with Pembrokeshire w i l l know
theee occur only too r a r e l y .
Having learned a l l that iVales could teach
him, e x c e p t how to become a N a t i o n a l i s t and to
master the language of the Land of the Leek, he
now came to ri.G.S. During his f i r s t year there
h i s p a t r i o t i s m received a serious shock, which
suppressed i t f o r ever, when on St. David's Day
he a r r i v e d s p o r t i n g a magnificent leek, and was
i n v i t e d by h i s f e l l o w students to eat i t i n i t s
e n t i r e t y or to s u f f e r degradation too h o r r i b l e
to r e l a t e . These and other i n c i d e n t s convince
him that student l i f e i n the l a t e 1930's was much
more e x c i t i n g than i t i s to-day. However, he
cams through a l l these t r i a l s , and only r e t a i n e d
h i s accent to bear witness to h i s Welsh o r i g i n s .
Having graduated, he tooji up research i n the
f i e l d of rubber-cement mixtures, and worked as
Research A s s i s t a n t to P r o f . &. (J. H. Clements i n
the G u i l d s . He was c a l l e d up i n the army and
served h i s country u n t i l 1946 when he returned
to the College as L i b r a r i a n . H i s experiences
i n the army, though uneventful, considerably
enriched h i s knowledge o f human nature, but the
s t o r i e s o f t h i s period of h i s l i f e are b e t t e r
l e f t to h i s own t e l l i n g .
On h i s return he found the L i b r a r y i n need
o f ^ c a t a l o g u i n g and s t a r t e d on the job with
great z e s t . " however, when "tLls was h a l f comp-
l e t e d he learned that the L i b r a r y would be
moved to i t s present p o s i t i o n to allow f o r
expansion. He then abandoned c a t a l o g u i n g and
s t a r t e d g e t t i n g ready f o r the b i g move. T h i s
took place just before the BU'omer vacation of
1951; during that time Mr. James could just he
seen emerging behind p i l e s of books, dust-covered
but ever c h e e r f u l . He s t i l l found time to deal
with ordinary e n q u i r i e s , but at f i r s t a h i t o f
luck was needed to f i n d a p a r t i c u l a r volume from
among the chaos r e i g n i n g on the shelves. O l d
and musty volumes came to light f o r the f i r B t time
in many years and have found space on the shelvets,
The Mines Entertainment Conmdttetare urgently seeking
a piece of canvas approximately 10' X 60'. Anyone who
knows i t s whereabouts i s requested to convey i t to the
Secretary, B.I..Fenhoulet.

A f t e r the Minutes of the meeting of Ist.Feb. 1907 had
been read, the chairman, Col.Mervyn O'Gorman,' introduced
the speaker Mr.T.G.Rose, at the Eng.Soc. and Motor Club
meeting ,Feb.26th. The lecture, a repeat of "The I n f l u -
ence of motor Racing on Car Design" was o r i g i n a l l y given
i n 1907 by the same speaker, with the same Chairman, and
p a r t l y the same audience.
Beginning with 1896, when the winner of the P a r i s to
Bordeaux and back averaged I5m.p.h. f o r 48 hours, solo
with only 20 minutes stop, Mr Rose traced automobile
design up t o '06. He mentioned the time when a Prefect of
Police put two columns of infantry and four heavy guns i n
tne path of a race; the time when Janassie on "Le Jamais
Content" d i d 65.3m.p.h. i n '97} the unforgettable occas-
ion when three m i l l i o n spectators covered the route of
the "03 Paris-Bordeaux, and twelve were k i l l e d . That put
the t i n hat on the French long distance races. The winner
averaged 65m.p.h. So shaken was the Government by the
t o l l of casualties that the cars had t o be taken home
by r a i l .
Mr. Rose showed 48 slides and was never dullshe knew
h i s stuff intimately. He described the Darracq cars,
which i n '04 reached I04m.p.h. They were rather heavy,
and after the lecture Col.O'Gorman described how, as a
judge, he once had t o weigh a Darracq t o make that i t was
inside the IOOCKg. l i m i t . Although the gearbox top had
been replaced by paper, the frame d r i l l e d , and everything
slingable slung,the car was s t i l l too heavy. Late that
night, C o l . O'Gorman was roused and asked t o reweigh the
ear. He found that i t was within the l i m i t . M y s t i f i e d , he
asked the mechanics how they had done i t . They said, "we
turned the oar upside down and shook i t " . This shook C o l .
O'Gorman, so he turned the starting handle ,just to make
sure. There was no resistance. The valve seatings were
gone. The ear did not qualify.
Slides of a '05 Guilds ear race were also shown.
Congratulations t o the societies concerned f o r organis-
ing such an interesting and entertaining event.
Mr. James's equanimity was never more
apparent than at t h i s p e r i o d and l a r g e l y c o n t r i -
buted to the smooth way i n which the change-over
took place. He has now s e t t l e d down to r e c a t a -
loguing, though h i s n a t u r a l pessimism makes him
f e a r that the expansion of the College w i l l
probably mean another change i n the f u t u r e , a
prospect he can hardly f a c e .
Despite the large amount of work to he done,
Mr. James, whenever he can a f f o r d the t i m e , i s
very w i l l i n g to t a l k on a large v a r i e t y o f subjects.
He w i l l discuss the c o n s t r u c t i o n o f w i r e l e s s s e t s ,
a m p l i f i e r s and t e l e v i s i o n sets with anybody
i n t e r e s t e d , but u s u a l l y i n the l a s t case h i s
advice i s don't". H i s own personal experience
ended in f a i l u r e , s i n c e , a f t e r s i x months o f
v i c i s s i t u d e s t r y i n g to remedy t e r r i b l e d i s t o r t i o n s
in his p i c t u r e , he went out, bought a s e t , and i s
now such an e n t h u s i a s t i c viewer that he has l o s t
a l l i n t e r e s t i n T.V.'s t e c h n i c a l d e l i g h t s .
He enjoys c l a s s i c a l music and h i s opinions
on modern a r t and music are s u r p r i s i n g l y strong
coming, from such a m i l d man. He also l i k e s
reading, but not detective s t o r i e s . He b e l i e v e s
i n the p o l i c y o f 'Live and l e t l i v e ' . He i s an
inveterate pipe-smoker. A long time ago he
decided to give up smoking hut a f t e r a few days
h i s temper became so e x c i t a h l e that h i s wife
presented him with a good supply of tobacco and
the advice to put that into h i s pipe and smoke i t .
He has never repeated the attempt, and encourages
students i n t h i s h a b i t , a l l o w i n g smoking i n the
L i b r a r y .
He i s a l s o a great l o v e r o f animals, and o f
cats i n p a r t i c u l a r .
As f a r as h i s post o f Hon. Treasurer" of
I.C. Lt.A.C.C. i s concerned he can only think of
one reason f o r h i s s e l e c t i o n . In one memorahle
s t a f f - r a c e he fought g a l l a n t l y f o r l a s t place
relinquishing i t , i n true sportsmanlike f a s h i o n ,
to h i s r i v a l , who r e c e i v e d a magnificent hoohy
p r i z e of a golliwog.
A l l these are just a few aspects o f h i s
character as those who know him w e l l w i l l proha-
b l y r e a l i z e . H i s sympathy and understanding f o r
others, h i s conscientiousness towards h i s work
are very n o t i c e a b l e , hut I think that i t i s b e t t e r
to f i n i s h on the story which he himself considers
h i s most embarrassing moment:
t\ former member o f the s t a f f asked him i f he
had seen v a r i o u s s c i e n t i f i c a r t i c l e s i n an
encyclopaedia published by a w e l l known d a i l y
newspaper. Mr. J a m e s , having a very poor
opinion o f t h i s p a r t i c u l a r paper, s a i d : "So, hut
i f they are comparable i n accuracy to the s c i e n -
t i f i c information published i n the paper, they
are, without doubt, unmitigated rubbish'." At
that the member of the s t a f f smiledi, paused and
s a i d : "I wrote that section of the encyclopaedia."
We apologise for the absence of a photogra.ph
of Mr. James.
This week's recommended 'eating houses' cater for two
types of lunch hour. The f i r s t i s prompted by the f e e l -
ing that sandwiches and coffee i n the Union are, while com-
manding the required sum, not of s u f f i c i e n t interest. Your
correspondent feels that the Pelham Snack Bar - not to be
confused with the Pelham G r i l l - i s worth a v i s i t when t h i s
i s the case. Here a lunch of soup, followed by beans,
spaghetti or welsh rp,rebit and so on, with a r o l l and coffee
can be had f o r just over two s h i l l i n g s . The girt behind
the counter i s very charming, as i s the clientele - I men-
t i o n t h i s because I f e e l that environment i s as important
during the lunch hour as the food we eat.
The second type of lunch you might require i s of sub-
s t a n t i a l p l a i n fare. I mean by t h i s such a meal as: soup,
"cut off, the j o i n t and 2 veg." rhubarb and custard and
perhaps coffee; f o r t h i s I recommend the "Bath Bun Shop"
i n Kensington High Street, i t i s on the l e f t , going west,
almost opposite Slater's Restaurant. The "Bath Bun Shop's"
c l i e n t e l e i s small and you can be sure of a table downstairs
at a l l times during the lunch hour. The price here i s ,
2/9 or 3/-, and as an added incentive s h a l l I add tha.t they
sometimes serve a delicious t r i p e !
THIS KEEK'S SPECIAL.
A longish walk along FuTham Road brings you to no. 208,
SAIAMIS, Restaurant, where you w i l l find t a s t e f u l impress-
i o n i s t water colours, uniformed waiters, serviettes, spot-
l e s s l y white cloths, and a very good meal f o r 2/8d. The
cost may mount a l i t t l e , as a r o l l and butter i s 4d,and
coffee 6d, and there i s a small surcharge; but i t i s an
excellent place t o take a guest. I f we used the star system
Salami's would get %ne maximum.

In a riot, very i n f o r m a t i v e a r t i c l e , the "Evening
Standard" p r o f i l e d P r o f e s s o r Levy, " B r i t a i n ' s Spot-
l i g h t S c i e n t i s t s . ( 4 ) . I t i s reported that he hedged
questions about h i s p o l i t i c a l a f f i l i a t i o n s , though he
a f f i r m e d h i s Marxian b e l i e f s . He made some of h i s ^
usual comments about the popular press, B r i t i s h and Czech
I t i s our o p i n i o n that he made more, which were not
p r i n t e d .
