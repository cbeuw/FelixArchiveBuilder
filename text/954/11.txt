On a bike and a prayer
Chris Riley tells the first part of his epic adventure traversing the Atlas
mountains in Morocco.
'So what do people who are going
camping do to take fuel for their
stoves?'
'They go by bus', said the cheery
British Airways voice at the end of
the customer enquiries line.
Stephane still packed his Calor
gas, although I refrained from
filling my stove with paraffin before
leaving. We wobbled through the
early morning London may-hem
that August morning and choked
and spluttered our way into Victoria
Station to check in. The desks were
deserted although smart buttoned
staff were milling around.
It was 7.05am when we started
to dismantle the bikes. Twenty
minutes later the job was complete
and we lugged everything round to
the other counter.
'I'm sorry,' said the cheery B A
voice, 'but luggage for that flight
has already left - we're not taking
any more - you'll have to hurry to
check in at Gatwick.'
I was stunned. How could ten
months of planning be foiled so
easily? In a frenzied, heart
pounding sweat we hurled bikes and
bags onto a waiting train. Our new
hope of still making the flight was
dashed when the guard spotted the
dismantled bikes in the corridor and
forcibly evicted us with threats of
calling the police to counteract my
furious protests.
'There's another train going in
fifteen minutes,' she smirked as she
flounced off down the platform.
The guard's van was bare and
second class crowded. It was a
horribly fraught journey down to
Gatwick - uncertainty mounting
with our frustration. The north
terminal lay a further monorail
journey away and by the time we
reached the check-in desk it was just
ten minutes before the flight was
due to leave.
'So there you are,' said the
cheery voice. 'We thought you
didn't want to go,' smiled a hostess
as we stumbled aboard. 'It's been
a bad day,' I replied as I slumped
into a seat over the wing. Andrea
and Stephane found window seats.
The child-like glee of flying for the
first time overwhelmed Andrea,
who sat fidgeting in her seat.
Stephane submerged himself in a
financial magazine and I in a guide
book.
Gibraltar was hot and bothered -
with tiny clogged streets - a mixture
of English seaside town and
Mediterranean holiday resort. The
oil fires burnt bright and sooty in
the bay and cranes bowed low about
the monstrous limestone hulk that
is Gibraltar. We shopped and
peddled around before heading out
towards Algiceras and our gateway
to Morocco. I dozed away the
voyage and woke numbed with
sleep and with the sun low in an
Atlantic sky.
Next week the intrepid team arrive
in Morocco and experience the
delights of the night life in Imilchil
