As much as you can drink
The sports centre is actually run by
the College, not the Union, but I
thought it would be informative to
provide some details on the new
pricing structure.
With the long awaited opening of
the sports centre imminent (we
hope) - It is now due to open in mid
February - the new prices have been
set. Believe it or not, entry prices
have gone down! A swim & gym
will cost you 75p compared with
80p before. The previous 80p
charge was a combination of a 30p
fee to get into the centre and 50p
for use of the facilities. Entry fees
to the sports centre itself have now
been dispensed with for staff and
students.
The idea behind the new pricing
structure is that people should pay
for what they use. Those wishing
to use the pool or the gym
exclusively will no longer have to
purchase a swim & gym ticket.
They will only pay 50p.
A further change is the
introduction of off-peak periods to
encourage students to make use of
gaps in their timetables and use the
sports centre when it is quiet.
During these periods, 9am to 12pm
and 2pm to 5pm, also 9pm onwards
and weekends, entrance to the pool
or gym will be 40p, with swim &
gym at 60p.
'Too good to be true' I hear you
say. Not quite. You will have to use
the sports centre more than once a
week to take advantage of the
season tickets. Last year the season
ticket price for swim & gym was
£25. Students were only charged
£18 as it was anticipated that the
centre would be closed for the latter
part of the year. As we all know the
refurbishment took place later than
planned, so this was not the case.
This year the proposed price for a
9 month (academic year) ticket for
swim & gym was £48. We thought
this was excessive and after a lot of
frantic negotiation on the part of
myself and other Union
representatives this has been
reduced to £33.75 peak and £27 off-
peak. The average at £30.38
reflects an increase of just over £5.
No increase is good, but in view of
the reduced single entry prices and
improved facilities, these charges
are not horrendously unfair. The
This Friday's event; the New Year
Carnival, is going to be the biggest,
cheapest, best night out in London.
For the giveaway price of £3.50,
you've got three top bands, bouncy
boxing, bar til 2am, disco til 3am
and a Happy Hour-and-a-Half from
8.30pm-10pm (all drinks down
20%).
The Headline band upstairs is
Jamiroquai. They're a ten piece
band (with didgerdoo), who are one
of the top dance bands in the
country at the minute. If you read
last week's article then you'll know
that they've been playing sell-out
shows all round the country and
have been getting much praise
wherever they go. They're of the
same ilk as The Brand New Heavies
and James Taylor Quartet and
they're loud and groovy.
Support band are The Friends of
Harry. They'll be playing their own
blend of raggle-taggle pop and
they'll have your body moving in
ways it never has before.
Downstairs in the Union Lounge
are 3 'A Minutes, who'll be playing
indie-rock gems. They've
supported the likes of Suede and
Kingmaker and they'll soon be huge
in their own right.
There'll be two discos running,
playing tunes til late. The usual NO
RE-ADMISSION policy applies.
R E M E M B E R , the last two Ents
events have sold out. If you don't
want to be disappointed, buy your
ticket now (£3.50 adv, £4 on the
door). If this event sells out, there
will only be admission with a ticket.
