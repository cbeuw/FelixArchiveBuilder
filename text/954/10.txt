The Lion, the Flower and the
evening out
Sam H offers us all the opportunity to let our hair down at the Malaysian
Society's Hibiscus night...
On the 6th February, the Malaysian
Society will bring to you an evening
enriched with the colours of the
fascinating Malaysian Culture: the
Hibiscus Evening. The programme
includes a variety of entertainment
and the guests will also be treated
to Malaysian delicacies, especially
prepared for the occasion. Of the
highlights of the evening are two
sketches of totally different themes
and background. To wet your
appetite, allow me to sneak a few
kittens out of the bag...
The first sketch evolves around
a young immigrant named Ah Chan
who flees from a crumbling and
poverty-stricken China in search of
a better life at the turn of the
century. A h Chan represents
millions of others like him who had
embarked in hordes on hazardous
journeys to foreign lands with only
hope and rigid faith to guide them.
The story proceeds to describe the
new life of Ah Chan in the British
Malaya and his struggle to
overcome numerous barriers in
carving out a living for himself with
his bare hands. Beneath this rags to
riches theme is a deeper and more
personal message which expresses
that many people don't seem to be
aware of: the ancestors of the
Malaysian Chinese (and of
American Chinese, Jamaican
Chinese, South African Chinese,
Indian Chinese, etc) went through
hell to establish themselves and to
be accepted into foreign societies.
In the beginning, immigrants and
natives led separate and segregated
lives. However, with the eruption
of World War 2 and Japanese
occupation, both sides began to
realise that unity was their only
strength against Japanese
Imperialism and that they had to
work together regardless of colour
and creed. This led to a new
appreciation and meaning to the
Malaysian identify.
Moving on to the second sketch,
we have a simple and romantic tale
about a group of young people who
fall in and out of love and then find
true happiness once again in the
arms of the person of their dreams.
Yes, this is a classic fairy tale with
a happy ending where the good
guys always win and the bad guys
turn out to be wimps. I won't tell
you more, the moral of the story?
Well, one shouldn't fool around
with one's own heart and mess with
other peoples'. In some games, we
simply have to play by the rules,
just like we cannot play snooker
with a tennis raquet— as there are
too many strings attached. And to
many hard-crusted lager louts
comrades out there, we all know
corny stuff ain't good for the
imgage, but hey, what the heck!
Just give the pub a miss for the
night. It's all for a laugh.
Eveyone on the production team
are working very hard to make the
sketches as well as the show a
success. Obviously, we cannot
promise you any seductive wench
oozing with sex appeal who could
always count on her basic instincts.
We do not have any cute eleven
year old kid who outsmarts bandits
when he is alone at home or in New
York. There isn't any tough muscle
man terminator who blows your
brains out with a lethal weapon after
greeting you with the famous words
'hasta la vista, baby'. What we have
is an invitation for you to come and
see the show. Our ambitious lot
intend to give you a good time.
Now that you have got a glimpse of
what lies in wait, do come along.
We really do have some goodies in
store for you, please don't hesitate
to join us. All are welcome.
with the unique chance to see the Northern Lion Dance.
The Northern Lion Dance is among
the most popular of what were
called 'Imitation Performances' in
ancient China in which acrobats in
costume imitate animals.
The Lion's head is made of
painted papiermache while its coat
is woven silk and hemp (or yak's
hair for stage performances). The
larger lion—which shakes its head,
wags its tail and rolls on the ground
is played by two acrobats, one
standing in front to control the head
and the other bending over to
control the body. This may seem no
big deal at first sight; in practice,
it has proved to be very physically
demanding, requiring skill and
stamina. The front acrobat, for
example, despite his poor vision
(due to structural hindrance) has to
brandish the lion head, which
weighs several kilograms, to the
correct sequence throughout the
show. It is an equally hard task for
the performer at the back, for he
may suffer from breathing
difficulties due to his prolonged
bent posture. Besides, some
movements could involve a high
degree of difficulty. For example,
the 'Shuang F e i ' , with the
assistance from the back, the front
acrobat has to jump to a height of
around two metres above the
ground before executing a flying
kick in the air. The back acrobat
then has to hold him in the position
and literally move him forward for
almost one metre before returning
him to the ground. In recent years,
acrobats have expanded the lion's
repertoire with feats which include
treading a ball across a seesaw and
standing on stacked benches—acts
which display the brave, lively and
playful character of the lion through
high acrobatic skill.
Lion dance skill, unlike other art
forms, could not be self-cultivated
(say by reading)—it can only be
passed on by a coach who is himself
an experienced acrobat. Indeed, it
is with such thought in mind that the
Northern Lion Dance Troupe of the
Malaysian Chinese Society U K was
approached. Being the first of its
kind in this country, it has been
invited to perform on many
occasions, including on Channel
Four two years ago.
After a significant period of
vigorous practice, the IC lads are
now ready to perform in the
'Hibiscus Evening', organised by
the Malaysian Society on the 6th
February. Don't miss it!
