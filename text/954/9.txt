A:Well I think they're very good.
There's a record being released on
February 8th by Eurobop which is
a rave version of the Rainbow
theme and it will be called Raynboe.
'The Save Rainbow Campaign' is
hoping people will go out and buy
it as a mark of respect.'
I look forward to hearing it,
though with trepidation. I had no
idea that Sesame's treat or Trip to
Trumpton where tributes. More
someone after an easy buck or two,
I thought.
Anyway despite all this there are
people on the 'other side' who have
been cruelly mocking the stars of
this'classic program': 'Doyou have
any qualifications Mr Bear? Well,
no... but I can read stories... and
I can cut out shapes...'
Shame on Steve Wright. He's
probably got a chip on his shoulder
because Rainbow attracted nearly 7
Felix 954
million viewers, when it was in the
'4 o'clock slot', who obviously
rated it higher than his afternoon
show for social, intellectual and
informative broadcasting. Well you
can see their point can't you?
It was the Daily Mirror, that
bastion of all things British, that
originally stood up for the doomed
program just before Christmas with
the message 'Rise up, mums!', but
I must confess I hold Bod most
Feature

closely to my heart when it comes
to the burning issue of Children's
TV. So why didn't that create such
a furore when it ended? Perhaps it
did, but a national campaign to save
it was steam-rollered by the bigwigs
at the Beeb at the time. If anyone
remembers I'd love to know.
Whatever happened to aunt Flo and
the frog with the really thin legs?
Or for that matter Bagpuss?
And talks to Geoffery Hayes about the end of an era.
To delve deeper into the Rainbow
legend, I spoke to Geoffrey Hayes,
known simply as Geoffrey to
millions of children, who has hosted
Rainbow, since it began in August
1973. Speaking from the
Hippodrome in Bristol where he is
in pantomime with the affable trio,
I attempted to find out why the
public response has been so strong.
Q:What do you think has made
Rainbow last for so long?
A:Well, I think the children liked
it because it was a bit different. The
show touched on social issues and
social manners etc...in a teaching
way but fun, which is not really
done very much in other
programmes. You had the regular
characters who were always up to
something that particular day. We
became part of a family in a way.
Q:Has there been swell in the
attendance at shows since the news
about Rainbow?
A:Well I don't know really, people
tend to book well in advance.. .but
it does seem to have stirred interest
around here. Someone has been
organising a petition which
everyone's been signing when they
come to do the show.
Q:How are the others, (Zippy and
co), taking to the idea that when the
pantomime finishes at the end of the
month there might be no Rainbow
to go back to?
A:Well they're not very happy
about it really... They're all a bit
bewildered by it all.
Q:How do you see Rainbow's
chances now?
A:Well, I haven't got any inside
information...nobody tells me
anything; but I'm a bit more
optimistic now it's all sunk in.
We're all just going along with
Thames. I think Children's TV just
has a bad relationship within
broadcasting. You see Thames has
managed to sell all their big
numbers because they make money.
With 'This is Your Life' and 'The
Bill' they can get a lot of money for
9m

bring in a lot of money.
Q:Have you got any alternative
arrangements for the future should
the campaign fail?
A:Well hopefully the plan is to get
back on the road as a stage show
although nothing definite has been
fixed up yet. Whatever comes along
really...or we might just split up
and do different things.. .maybe go
for straight acting jobs...I don't
know.'
It would seem quite a transition
from potato printing to the cut and
thrust of drama. Perhaps Eldorado
the advertising space, which just
isn't the case with children's
programmes.
Q:Do you think it's a case of the T V
bosses not caring about Children's
TV?
A:Well, I don't think they do care
as much...it's an accountants
world...it's money that talks these
days. It's probably a generalisation
and I'm sure there are people in the
business who are committed, but
there are others who'd happily see
them replaced by game shows
which cost very little to make but
would make a suitable stepping
stone for Bungle? No? Well if you
feel that Rainbow's demise would
be another nail in the coffin for
quality television then come to the
Felix office to find out how to get
in touch with Jacquie Doyle-Price
and Co. There must be somebody
out there who would like to be
remembered at this World famous
seat of learning for something. Why
not for establishing 'Rainbow
Soc.'? Sisters of Zippy, Brothers of
Bungle, The Save Rainbow
Campaign implores you!!
