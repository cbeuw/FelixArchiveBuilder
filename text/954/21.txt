Carmen
'If you love me you'd best watch
out.'
This arch temptress, animal,
child is petulant, powerful, sensual
and violent. Sally Burgess is
mesmerising. From the moment
that this brazenly barefoot hussy
slithers into her Habanera the
audience is bewitched. Carmen is
an earthy Hedda Gabler; bored to
abstraction, in this case by her
slovenly poverty, she toys with her
only weapon, seduction, in a
chilling dance with death.
Unfortunately, her prey lack
credibility. Edmund Barman's Don
Jose is not equal to the acting
demands of his role, the portrayal
of a confused bumkin is stilted and
banal. Carman's second conquest is
Donald Maxwell's smarmy star
matador, Escamillo. The
pantomime antics of the beer-gutted
bull fighter and his entourage
slackened and trivialised the dark
dramatic pace.
The main criticism of this
essentially good production is the
sets. In an attempt to evoke the
oppressive claustrophobia of
seediness, poverty and heat from
which the passion of the opera
errupts. Maria Bjornson gives us a
mess. Located in a South American
scrapyard every inch of the stage is
a neon assault course for the huge
cast. Though interestingly detailed
at first, the overall effect is wearing
and dissipates the dramatic impact
of the music as actors wade through
great wastes of rubbish on the
Coliseum's collossal stage. The
smuggling scene which begins Act
III far from being eerie and
haunting is reminiscent of Ealing
Broadway station on a Monday
morning.
I must however thank the
orchestra and conductor Justin
Brown for an exemplary, inspiring
reading, alive to every nuance of
Bizet's electric score. The man was
a genius of musical theatre his every
note is relevant and riveting. I wish
I could get it out of my head!

Where in the dictionary does it say
that 'accessible' is synonymous
with crass, vulgar or utter rubbish?
Can the general public really not
cope with Donizetti's whole score,
articulately translated into English?
Well Travelling Opera, think not.
Their mission is to 'bring opera to
the people', in this case; people will
be justified in giving it right back.
The audience is insulted with
appallingly pronounced Italian
accompanied by flash card
'surtitles' or pidgin English
translations, from the Rod, Jane and
Freddy school of Lyrics,
grotesquely amplified into a blur of
pain. In case this is not enough to
make 'difficult Donizetti' palatable,
singing is accompanied Benny Hill-
style running around a lot, falling
over and pretending to dance. When
it comes to updated, fun opera look
out for the iriimitable London Music
Festival Company who recently
brought their hilariously funny,
immaculately sung Rossini's
'Cinderella' to the Royalty Theatre.
But if a) you want to try Opera
out, you'd loathe it after this; b) you
want comedy—go to a comedy
club; c) you love Opera, you'll hate
this.
