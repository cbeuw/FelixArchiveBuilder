The dispute between Chris
Davidson, Imperial College Union
(ICU) President, and Jonty Beavan,
Felix Editor, has escalated this
week. In a letter published in this
morning's Felix, M r Davidson tells
Mr Beavan to 'keep up the good
work, Robert Maxwell would be
proud of you.'
The row centres on a front page
report in last week's Felix, which
said that M r Davidson invited
members of the University of
London General Union Council
(GUC) to join in a breakaway
council with himself as chairman.
The article also details allegations
made by two London University
sabbaticals, who said that M r
Davidson was drunk when he made
this 'breakaway' call. In the same
article, M r Davidson denied the
allegations, saying that he was
definitely not drunk.
The Felix article was raised at last
Monday's meeting of Imperial
College Union Council. M r
Davidson said that the Felix story
was inaccurate, and that Gareth
Light, Felix News Editor, had

Dr P Garrard, Department of

eye of trained staff until they gain
their own confidence and
experience in outdoor situations.

quoted him in 'poor context'. A
suggestion by M r Davidson that the
matter should be closed was
objected to by Rhian Picton,
Biochemistry Departmental
Representative. Ms Picton
suggested that M r Davidson write
a letter to Felix, recording the
article's alleged inaccuracies. The
letter is on page four.
Mr Davidson was also asked
about the article in his Presidential
New Year interview on IC Radio.
Mr Davidson said that the article
was not true, and pointed to the
other members of the Imperial
College Union GUC delegation, all
of whom, according to M r
Davidson, agree that the President
didn't call for a breakaway council.
Mr Davidson added that me article
was 'printed in a way that makes it
look inflammatory', and that it
didn't help his relationships with the
University of London Union
(ULU).

The Chief Executive of St.
Bartholomew's Hospital is urging
caution after press reports that the
hospital may have won a reprieve
from closure. Professor Michael
Besser said that the reports in three
Sunday newspapers were the result
of a leak 'high up' in the
Department of Health, but added
that he could not confirm or deny
the reports.

That's it. I didn't say we should set
up a breakaway council,' said M r
Davidson.
When told that Felix insisted their
story came from two London
University sabbaticals, M r
Davidson said, 'if they did or they
didn't, that's entirely up to them.'
He added that he 'got quite annoyed
on Friday (15 January)', and
continued, 'when I get a story like
that on the front page, I do question
the money we pay for this (Felix)'.
T think we should keep a free and
independent press at the College,'
said M r Davidson, though he
declined to say whether he thought
ICU should continue to pay for
Felix, as he said he didn't want to
preempt the work of the Working
Party on ICU structure.
On other subjects, M r Davidson
said that the job of ICU President
was not as he initially thought it
would be. He added that he thought
of himself more 'as a managing
director rather than a president'.

In an interview with Felix, M r

not feel that they are the only ones

concentrating solely on the
academic side of things.

Organisational Review, the
President said that there was no
forum to openly assess student
opinion. 'Our organisation doesn't
meet that,' he said. The purpose of
the review was to decide what
students want from a students'
union, and he had no skeletons in
the cupboard. 'I'm trying to avoid
the implication that I have
something to hide. I'm not out to
get anybody', M r Davidson said.
The President said that ICU 'is
having an input into how voluntary
membership is proceeding,' though
he added that he thought the
implementation of voluntary
membership had 'been stalled at the
moment'. 'I don't think it will go
much further this parliamentary
session,' he continued.
On a possible disaffiliation of
Imperial College from the
University of London, M r
Davidson said that students should
not lose out 'if everybody is mature
about it'. 'There are people who are
throwing their cards on the table too
early. If battle lines are drawn it
could be dangerous,' he warned.
