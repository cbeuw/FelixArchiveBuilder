Radiohead: only their mothers could love them.

Radiohead ULU 15.1.93
Definitely an ugly band in every
sense, but musically that's a good
thing. Springing up from Oxford
onto the circuit supporting
Kingmaker last autumn, they have
released two excellent EPs, with the
third coming out on Feb 1.
While not as impressive as the
Islington Powerhaus gig last term,
Radiohead here play to a bigger,
younger and drunker audience. The
style was different and definitely
looser with Thorn introducing the
songs and looking like he's enjoying
it for once.
What was most obvious was the
increase in the number of people
who knew the words to the songs,
which for them is a good sign,
because they're not just about noise,
and the self-depreciating emphasis
of the lyrics to 'Prove Yourself and
'Creep' demonstrating this
succinctly.
Radiohead are headed for
greatness if they can keep it
together. Luv em to death.

Alice in Chains—Dirt
Alice in Chains have produced the
ultimate record for the kind of
American teenager we have come
to hate.
It has all the elements required for
the genre; the over—dubbed vocal
harmonies, the token 'we're hard
but still sensitive' quiet acoustic
type track—and of course, the
band's portrait on the back cover.
If AOR rock had a good name,
Alice in Chains would give it a bad
one.
Predictably, and frankly, get a
life, but something else.

• Out on Columbia.
Rage Against the Machine
Rap metal from South central—
'Fuck the law, fight the war!'. It's
funky, it's hard and it's saying
something.
What it lacks in variety, it
compensates for in raw energy.
Admittedly there are some duff
tracks and wanky guitar solos, but
the album credits John Coltraine
and Chuck D, and elements of an
open style Led Zep are also
obvious.
Possibly inaccessible to some, but
definitely catch them live at U L U
in February for a loud night out.

Bowlfish — Powerhaus
2.2.93
Bowlfish certainly have pretentions
to great things in the arena of indie-
rock. Just listen to the overblown
opening, two minute instrumental to
'Mrs Frank'. Still after that is quite
good despite the skinny vocals.
'Stingy Nettle' is the best track,
with a nice fiery sprint to it and the
overtones of a Hiisker Dii
experience. 'Plead Song' switches
pace again into speed rock mode.
Expect good things in the future,
one and all.
