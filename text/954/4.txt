Feminism has gone too damn far.
It has become exactly that which it
was originally designed to oppose
i.e. sexism. It has, instead of
undermining male chauvinism,
established female chauvinism in an
attempt to counter it and this, rather
than reduce bigotry has only
augmented it.
Further, it has become a more
extreme form of bigotry than male
chauvinism is and maybe ever has
been. Do you think that a book
entitled 'All women are bitches'
would go unnoticed by the ever
increasing number of female
pressure groups? The air would be
thick with the screams of complaint,
perhaps even the claim that such a
book would encourage men to go
out and rape/maim/murder the first
women they encounter. Yet how
many men complain, en masse, of
the release of a book entitled 'All
men are bastards'? I find offensive,
not the book itself, but the fact that
a female chauvinist book is accepted
Felix 954
while even the mere hint of sexism
in a joke is enough to get it banned
from television.
Another example is a charge too
many feminists are heard to whine,
the accusation that all men are
potential rapists, a statement which
I find is comparable in its offensive
content and erroroneous nature to
the statement 'all women are
begging for it and secretly fantasise
of being raped anyway'. Not only
do the vast majority of men find the
very notion of rape repugnant but,
if the national statistics on male
impotence are true, a fair
percentage of men are incapable of
sexual intercourse of any kind
whatsoever.
Furthermore, few men are keen
on the idea of having sex and not
pleasing their partner; rather, it's
one of the most major blows to the
male ego. Sex which is not mutually
pleasurable is the domain of the
freak, the potential rapist, the
minority of men.
Not content with this extreme
thinking there is a strain of feminists
who believe that sex was a male
invention to be enjoyed by men and
that women have only been tricked
into believing that they enjoy it (I
am forced, loathed as I am to do so,
and resort to strong words; I do not

apologise for the statement: 'This
is a load of bollocks' and hope that
reader and editor alike will
appreciate it for what it is—a last
resort when polite words fail me.).
I know of as many women with,
shall we say, nymphomaniac
tendencies as their male
counterparts and, although I don't
claim that my personal knowledge
is representative of the nation as a
whole and although I concede that
statistics indicate that more women
are dissatisfied with sex than men,
to say women don't enjoy sex and
all men do is nonsense, the raving
of a sexually frustrated woman.
Which brings me (and with the
smoothness of a Radio 4 continuity
announcer, I thought) to my
explanation as to the thoughts held
by radical feminists.
Who's ever seen an attractive
feminist? This is not a dig at
feminists, though God knows they
deserve it; I am not being facetious
but I am offering a reasonable
explanation to the semi-insane
witterings of these bizarre women.
Is it purely coincidental that the
suppositions as to the existence of

attractive feminists is as tenuous as
those of humankind's evolutionary
missing link? This affords us a deep
insight to their psyche. I suggest
that these women, discontent with
their own sex life or indeed lack of
it, seek to discourage their sisters'
sexual activities by the use of
propoganda and so reduce them to
their own miserable condition in
addition to reducing the overall
competition for men.
I believe, however, that I have the
intelectual capacity to realise that
not all feminists are what they
appear. There are many pseudo-
feminists masquerading under the
feminist front in an attempt to be
high brow; Julie Birchall, Mail on
Sunday columnist, for example,
cleverly uses this technique of
berating men for the sake of
appearing controversial and
consequently selling her work and
her paper. This I find quite tolerable
and, quite frankly, enjoy reading.
I therefore recognise the necessity
to distinguish her 'views' and those
of her peers from the main body of
feminism. She's fairly attractive as
well.
An interesting
conversation
Dear Jonty,
In your front page article in last
weeks edition of Felix I think I
should point out that there were
some accuracies. Quite remarkable
I know, and indeed difficult to
believe, but I thought that, to be
fair, I should highlight this miracle
of reporting prowess arid skill, so
that all our members can be truly
proud of the astounding feat. Indeed
I am called Chris Davidson, I am
Imperial College Union's President
and I was at the General Union
Council at U L U for their last
meeting. In the interests of true
sarcasm I will not mention the rest
of the report, other than to say that
the additional people in the Imperial
delegation, did not recall the
meeting as in any way resembling
the manner it was reported in your
most reputable of mini-tabloids.
Keep up the good work, Robert
Maxwell would be proud.
With kindest regards,
Chris Davidson.
