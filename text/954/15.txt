Play it again
Next Thursday FilmSoc is proud to
present an all time classic—
Casablanca. Made in 1941, the
story concerns the brief revival of
a relationship between Humphrey
Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, due to
a brief encounter in Morocco during
the war.
The film is a regular feature on
many a critic's list of top ten films
of all time. Many of the scenes may
seem cliched until you appreciate
that this was the film all the others
copied.
With Sam playing 'As Time Goes
By', Bogey and Claude Rains
starting off a wonderful friendship
and Ingrid Bergman lighting up the
screen, there are a lot of magic
moments, so take the opportunity to
enjoy it all on the BIG screen.
The show starts at 6.30 on
January 28th in Mech Eng 220,
membership is now down to only
£3.50, with the first film free,
otherwise entry is 90p for members
and £1.90 for non-members.
Star Wars
This coming Monday, ICSF is
proud to present The Empire Strikes
Back and Return of the Jedi, both
of which will be shown in their full
widescreen glory.
The story hardly merits mention,
so I won't. Some of the greatest
special effects ever put on celluloid
may be seen, more importantly, in
one of the most epic cinematic
battles between good and evil. Turn
up and enjoy Ewoks getting
slaughtered, Atats, Boba-Fett, Pizza
the Hut, X - , Y - and even A-wing
fighters. The cast, meanwhile,
includes Harrison Ford, Carrie
Fisher, the Emperor of the Galaxy
and a Muppet extra by the name of
Yoda.
The first film starts at 6pm in
Chem Eng LT1 on Monday, the
second at 8.20pm. Membership is
just £3, whilst entry is free to both
filsm for new members and just 50p
for one and 70p for both for old, so
come along and relive the
excitement of your childhood!
