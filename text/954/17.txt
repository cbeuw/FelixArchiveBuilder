Spin D o c t o r s - U L U 18.3.93
and Borderline 15.2.93
The Spin Doctors have made it. In
the rock 'n' roll hall of fame is
anything higher than the cover of
'Rolling Stone' magazine? So what
you've never heard of them. Life
is full of discovery as you might
find out one day. Their US debut
LP 'Pocket Full of Kryptonite' has
finally reached million selling
status, and single 'Little Miss Can't
Be Wrong' is top 30 and the most
requested radio song on A O R
stations.
Firmly embedded in the roots-
orientated Deadhead touring scene,
the Spin Doctors took over a year
to build up popular momentum to
their eclectic homegrown groove.
Initital album sales were only
60,000, but the cross-over
explosion occurred, and it is being
released in Britain followed by a
tour.
Prior to that invest in 'Little
Miss'; get a taste. It kicks off with
an undulating blues background,
soon interwoven with the
infectiousness of the southern
boogie. The story is simple, Boy
and Girl an' all that jazz but add that
magic touch and even that's
paletable. Then experience the
spaced-out experience of 'forty or
fifty' and hunker down to the
pearljamming 'refrigerator car'.
Remember a million Americans
can't always be wrong.
As the Spin Doctors say 'Our
sound just kind of revealed itself to
us. Like some kind of crazy
sandwich that's exponential...'

Superchunk - The Question
is how Fast
A lively, enthusiastic piece of guitar
pop with an easily remembered
singalong chorus 'The Question is
how Fast' will be rapidly lapped up
by any competent indie bop kid.
However whether it recites the tale
of the tortoise racing and beating the
hare, or of the dilemmas of the
virgin contemplating the rapid
movements of the lover, I have no
idea. Whatever the lyrics are about,
the guitars and distorted vocal
harmonies combine for attractive
listening. On the flip appears the
more frantic, but of a similar
nature- 'Forged it' and '100000
fireflies', the latter telling of how
the Superchunkies wanted to kill
themselves on the front lawn after
troubled dreams of unrequited love.
Everything a pop song should be.

Madness, The Farm, 808
State Edinburgh 21st Dec
When I read who was supporting I
was even more bemused than on
discovering Morrissey was at the
original reunion gig in August
where his fans where outnumbered
100 to 1 and he was consequentalely
given a less than friendly
reception.Here there was a
generous spread of ravers and
pseudo indie-philes throughout the
barn of the Ingleston centre. We
missed 808 state on account of the
public transport to within a mile and
a half being non-existent but had
plenty of time to get near the stage
for The Farm, phewee. They
played a selection of their many
excellent songs including "Groovy
train", "Groovy train"
and..erm.."Groovy train (remix?)"
all of which played backwards
reveal the subliminal message
'' PARC, PARC, P A R C . . " . Appar-
ently Suggs is no longer managing
them but the Mads must owe them
something. How else do you
explain a band that gets mud thrown
at it at lunchtime at Reading being
supported by one that headlines the
last day on Glastonbury's N M E
stage? "Our guitarist seems to be
having some problems"...he can't
play? "Here's one for all you
naughty boys and naughty girls out
there".. .vomit. The realisation that
Hooton "dances" just like a
chemist I once went out with raised
a smile but for those who found no
redeaming features a fight was the
only outlet. The security was as
disorganised as the gangs were
organised and although, at least
around us, the "wave of fear" was
only of Madness not coming on nine
people did go to hospital and
' "hundreds", I read in the Scotsman
the next day, left early. Madness
may, to quote the Big Issue, be
making the greatest comeback in
rock history, (though I rather doubt
it), but the shit venue and lack of
impressive lightshow due to the
crowd lights being left on after the
fighting were making the chances
of this maintaining the standard set
at Finsbury Park slim. The audience
was relieved and ecstatic when they
did finally take the stage and as all
and one roared the intro to "One
step beyond" for many the moment
they'd waited all their lives for had
finally arrived...well it was jolly
exciting."This is the heavy,heavy
monster sound...the nuttiest sound
around.." bellowed Chas Smash
dressed in top hat and tails.Too
fuckin' right! Three minutes later
the frenzy subsides and Lord Suggs
smoothly utters the magic words
from their debut single "The
Prince" - "Buster,he sold the
heat...with a rock steady beat..."
Here we go again. They rapidly
plough through about 16 songs all
taken from Divine Madness.Clearly
this was aimed more at the new fans
than the hardcore following.
Between the songs from '79 to '86
was a casual but still fresh repartee.
" M y name is Suggs and I'm not
very funky" spake the oracle before
cavorting across the stage using his
umbrella as a third leg to help pull
Lee " K i x " Thompson out of the
crowd he's been swinging on a rope
over, with the same carefree ease
as when he climbed the lighting
gantry when the Nutty Boys played
here at the Freshers
ball.Particularly good were "It
must be love" and "Grey day"
with its eerie instrumental. There
was just the one encore of "House
of fun" and the culmination of the
set,"Baggy trousers" with K i x
doing the legendary flying
saxophonist bit over the stage. O.K.
the play list has been cut by half a
dozen songs since the original
comeback and the idea that "none
of them are in it for the money"
seems a bit hopeful but they still
play a damn good show and as the
masses trudged off through the
snow there was a feeling that what
they'd just witnessed was something
special and something that in years
to come they'd have kicked
themselves for not making the effort
to go and see.
