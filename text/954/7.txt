Rag Rundown
So, where have we got to? Last
week I gave you the lowdown on
a few of the bigger events coming
up in Rag Week, and now, with
only one six more days til the
official start of the craziest week of
the year, I think it's time to fill you
in on a few of the details. So take
a deep breath, give your lecturer a
smile, and join me for a whistlestop
guide to Rag Week.
Friday 29th, Rag Carnival,
organised by Guilds. Barfly
jumping and booze - the perfect way
to kick off the week. Also the
launch of the Limited Edition Rag
Week T-shirt. If you don't turn up
to Carnival you won't be able to
buy one, as simple as that! Read the
article elsewhere on this page for
details.
Saturday 30th, Rag Raid. A mass
orgy/collection which will probably
take place in Birmingham. Spend a
day holding a can whilst the public
pour money into it, and relax
afterwards with a huge party, with
Loughbrough Rag, at Birmingham
Union.
Sunday 31st, Rag Rugby & five-
legged pub crawl. Mines firsts play
the Ladies' rugby team - but with
a twist. The men are handicapped
by suspenders and wellies!
Cap it all with a
five-legged pub crawl in the
evening and you have a bonafide
excuse for not walking in a
particularly straight line, or even
staggering!
Monday 1st, Mines Dirty Disco.
You should know all about this
from last week's article, but if you
were too busy scribbling down
lecture notes to concentrate fully,
the principle is this: the less you
wear, the less you pay. Simple,
huh?
Tuesday 2nd, Slave Auction &
Film Evening. The Slave Auction
is where anyone who is silly enough
to take part auctions off twentyfour
hours of their time, with the
proceeds going to charity. This
event is a chance for anybody who
hasn't quite got round to tidying
their room for a while, or done the
washing up in the past six weeks,
or managed to find the time to
scrape that particularly nasty
growth off the mouldy bit of carpet
in the corner, to buy a slave to do
it for them. Imagine! All your meals
cooked, clothes washed, lab reports
written up... .unfortunately, sexual
favours by consent only! But still
worth considering - you could even
club together with a group of
friends to buy a really good-looking
slave! Mech Eng 220 at lunchtime.
Be there or miss the bargains. The
film evening is kindly organised for
Rag by FilmSoc, and will include
such delights as pre-film cartoons
and Monty Python. Hopefully with
a bar as well. Venue, time and films
to be announced - watch this space!
Wednesday 3rd, Beer Festival. If
you don't know about this yet then
you don't know the right people.
This annual event is the biggest non-
C A M R A beer festival in the
country, and basically involves lots
of people spending the whole
afternoon drinking lots of different
beers in the comfort and safety of
the JCR. Also your first chance to
purchase this year's version of IC's
notorious RagMag. Full list of beers
should be appearing in next week's
Rag Week pull-out in Felix.
Thursday 4th, Hypnosis. Martin
Taylor, hypnotist extraordinaire,
spends the evening putting people
into trances. Not quite in the same
way as a lecturer does, though!
Rather more entertaining and no
scrawled lecture notes to revise
afterwards.
Friday 5th, Rag Bash.
Approaching the end of Rag Week,
we take over the Union once again
for live bands, disco and a bit of a
party.
Saturday 6th, S N K P J , or
Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump, to give it its full
title. This is where you watch crazy
people streaking from Harrods back
to College, trying not to get arrested
on the way. Last year, Steve
Farrant and Paul Thomas got
'picked up' (in a manner of
speaking) by the Diplomatic Police,
who gave them a lift back to the
Union. Serves them right for
strolling back wearing nothing but
bowties! A prize is on offer for the
last person back, so who dares
wins.
OK, that's all the events covered.
But Rag Week is a lot more than
just these! For a start there are the
services, most of which were listed
last week. The Guilds Hit Squad,
those Masters of the Flan, will be
on the loose again, settling old
scores and starting feuds. The RCS
will be doing Handcuff-a- grams,
Pint-a-grams and Milkie-milkie-a-
grams plus gnoming and grim-
reaping. The contracts will be £5
each, but there are discounts for
bulk orders and a negiotiable rate
for 'notables'. So if you share a
grudge against someone with a
group of friends, then club together
and get your own back. Let them
guess who took the contract out!
Another service Rag will be
providing throughout the week is
breakfast for those people who
always wake up too late in the
morning to make their own! You
should be welcomed outside your
lecture theatre by cheap cereal and
a not-too-cheery smile (Raggies
don't like getting up early either!)
so there is no excuse for rumbling
tummies all the way through your
lectures.
Last but not least, just for you,
Rag have also organised for Queens
Tower to be open two lunchtimes
in Rag Week. Between the hours of
12-2pm on Monday 1st Feb and
Thursday 4th Feb, you will (for
only a nominal fee) be able to
partake of the breathtaking views of
London to be had fron the top of
QT. Remember your camera! The
W A N N A SLAUGHTER YOUR
FRIENDS? E L I M I N A T E
A B S O L U T E S T R A N G E R S ?
T E X A S C H A I N S A W
MASSACRE IN SOUTHSIDE?
YEAH?
Then play KILLER! The Rag
game of murder, mayhem and
serious fun. Arm yourself and hunt
down your target, "remove" them
and then on to their target, see that
body count rise.
To play, all you need are two
clear passport photos of yourself
tower is not open on many
occasions throughout the year, so
make the most of it.
Finally, if you haven't got
involved yet, either by offering
your services as a gnome or reaper,
or taking part in Killer, or giving
up a day in the Slave Auction
(which may not be as bad as it
sounds - my '24hrs' last year turned
out to be no more taxing than being
taken out for a Chinese meal by two
very charming Greek students!),
then you have only one week left
to reconsider. Take the chance to
do something really silly for a very
good cause before the exams get
even closer and you might - horror
of horrors!- actually have to start
working! Be Mad, Be Silly but
whatever else you do, make sure
you're a part of it.
and £2.50. Get yourself along to the
IC Union office at any lunchtime
before January 27th or come along
to today's Rag meeting, usual
place, usual time. Whichever you
go to, you'll get a copy of the rules,
your first target and a death
certificate. Alternatively, contact
Andy Wensley through the 3rd year
U G mailracks in the Maths
department. With cash prizes for
the winners, you don't want to miss
out on this. Remember, have fun
and be lethal!
MURDER!
