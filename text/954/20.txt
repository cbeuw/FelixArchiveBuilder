Marching For Fausa
This new play by Biyi Bandele, set
in the cruel dictatorship of Songhai,
contains everything that is expected
of a play set in Africa: vibrant
costumes, a cast of black people,
everyone talking loudly and various
chants/traditional songs that are
blurted out frequently and
unexpectedly. It would have been
easy to ignore these and concentrate
on the meaning of the play, but
since the focus of the play was
largely about freedom, these typical
ingredients were vital to help
convey the struggle for freedom that
was faced.
The cast are flawless, with each
thespian performing at least three
roles and some requiring the
addition of make-up or a total
change of clothes that was put on
with all speed. It is well structured
and exquisitely presented but the
subject matter drags the play so far
down into the pit of depression that
not even the hilarious jokes can pull
it back up for long.

Misery
This is the stage play based on the
novel by Stephen King. It is
essentially about the horrific,
tormeted ordeal of an author, Paul
Sheldon (Bill Paterson) when held
captive by Annie Wilks (Sharon
Gless), his psychopathic 'No. 1
Fan', after she rescues him from a
near fatal car crash.
The adaptation and interpretation
is unable to withhold the fear and
chilling feel which is unceasing in
both the book and the film. Unlike
the movie, the play tries to voice the
thoughts of the author, the dry
humour providing comic relief.
Unfortunately, the overall effect is
botched.
Go and see Misery if you will but
it is only worth the cheapest seats.

Twelfth Night—Dramsoc
For anyone not aquainted with this
play I will give you a brief synopsis.
This girl (Viola) fancies this bloke
(a count) so she pretends to be a boy
and goes to work for him. As a
result of this she is sent by her new
master to go and woo, on his behalf,
a lady and widow. Unfortunately
the widow falls for our heroine -
very complicated. Fortunately we
find out that there is a twin brother
to Viola who had previously been
lost at sea following a shipwreck.
This finally means that Viola gets
her man and the Lady gets hers.
As far as the performance goes,
I have to praise the members of
Dramsoc for a job well done. The
acting was, on most counts, superb
with star performances on the parts
of Lyanna (Viola) and (Malvolio).
The set was well thought out and
made full use of. A live band
providing musical accompaniment
and interludes really helped bring
the performance to life. I would
reccommend you to check out their
next performance.
