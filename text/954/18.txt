The Ultimate Step by Penny
Clarke.
Yes, it's yet another exercise book,
and it's all about the latest fitness
craze - STEP. For those of you who
have not encountered this new
craze, you basically have a step in
front of you and you step up and
down. Exciting, huh?
But it has caught on. And there
is a little bit more to it than just
stepping up and down, as the book
explains. The exercises involve arm
movements, walking along the step,
and even sitting on it!
The book begins with an
introduction to step exercising and
the standard exercise comments and
Exit Berlin
by Tim Sebastian
Last week was an appropriate one
in which to review Tim Sebastian's
new book, Exit Berlin. For one, the
trial of former East German
dictator, Eric Honecker, ended in
'frustration and farce', with the old
despot living to fight another day,
or even three months, despite the
fact that he is more likely to be
suffering from Chilean-wine-
induced tapeworm than liver
cancer. The second event, surely
more important, was the publication
of the transcript of that
conversation between one C .
Windsor (former heir to the throne)
and the happily married C. Parker-
Bowles, who I am sure does not
recline like her namesake. The
important element being, of course,
the theory that MI5, who do not
exist per se, recorded the
conversation in London and then
rebroadbast it in the sticks so many
times that so ham was bound to pick
it up. Well, they did attempt to
destabilise the Wilson government,
remember?
Of course, if you believe the
conspiracy theory, then you are
likely to enjoy Sebastian's tome, it
being this Guardian reader's
fantasy-in-print. Unfortunately, the
book is sad, regretful even, to the
point of being melancholy. Such is
the nature of intelligence. There is
also a powerful, if subtle, craving
for revenge, a desire to settle old
Felix 954
advice you find in any fitness book.
Then it explains the step itself.
Apparently there is a recommended
size and height, and if you can't
afford to buy one from a sports
shop, you are encouraged to get out
that Black and Decker and make
one yourself.
The book then takes you through
a series of warm-up routines.
Initially, explanations of each
routine are accompanied by very
clear line drawings, normally two
per exercise, but later on, in the
main routines, the diagrams
disappear and you're left with pages
full of text.
As you can probably tell by the
startling transformation to a sylph-
like figure, I rigorously tested this
exercise program. I feel so much
better for it, too.

scores. As I said, definitely one for
Guardian hacks.
It's also intelligently written,
without demanding full brain
cooperation, useful when reading it
at four in the morning. It does tend
to get a bit contorted, with the
flashbacks causing a bit of 'where-
are-we-now?' confusion. The text
flows well, though the book's
structure is fairly basic, slow to
start, building to a heady pace in the
middle, then a bit of stocktaking,
followed by the helicopter dash to
Moscow (where else?). I found it
useful to re-read the prologue after
finishing the book. It summarised
the plot, but only after reading the
book, as it gives nothing away on
first reading.
It's very much in the Spycatcher
mode, though eminently more
readable. I wonder how much is
true, and how much is based on
what Sebastian learned while he
was earning large peanuts as BBC
correspondent in Poland, Moscow
and Washington? The whole thing
may be complete, believable
fantasy, but then again, the string
of spy books from Sebastian could
be an airing all the skeletons he
learned of, strictly off the record,
comrade.
Menace in my own shadow?
Don't be ridiculous.

The Salamandra Glass
by A W Mykel
After the violent death of Christian
Gladieoux his son Michael a former
Vietnam vet. goes in search of
vengeance. Rather than being a
simple murder Michael slowly
discovers that his fathers killing was
a political assassination by the
international, tainted organisation
Salamandra. Fairly predictably,
Michael takes revenge on some of
it's leaders.
The plot straddles the line
between the feasible and the wholly
unbelievable rather precariously yet
despite this the book is actually
quite gripping and certainly
possesses the quality that makes you
want to keep on reading. Had there
been a book review just before
Christmas I would have told you
how it would have ben the perfect
Christmas television antidote in that
you can put it down and pick it up
at any given instant with no loss to
enjoyment.
An enjoyable read but quite
unmemorable; you'll have forgotten
it entirely by the following
Christmas.

Mulu—The Rain Forest
by Robin Hanbury-Tenison
An updated reissue of the world's
first popular book that highlighted
the significant depletion of the rain
forests is now available. Written by
its main organiser, Robin Hanbury-
Tenison, it details the expedition to
north Borneo where he and dozens
of other scientists set up the Mulii
National Park. Today the park is
still going but the surrounding area
has been destroyed.
You do NOT have to get an
Ecology degree to understand this
nor do you need to have been on an
expedition to relate to the
experiences that the team faced.
You do need to read one chapter per
sitting though to follow what is
happening; a few pages a day will
eventually get you confused.
To know what kind of work is
involved in saving your average
rainforest, then read this book.
Complicated terminology is kept to
a relative minimum although the
amount of thanks and praise that is
dished out to all who were involved
by the author can get a bit
nauseating.
