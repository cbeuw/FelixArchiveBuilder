Underage drinks March for votes
by Declan Curry
A 14 year old French girl was taken
to Charing Cross Hospital last
Saturday night after collapsing in
the Union building. Laura Pimentel
was attending a private party in the
Ents lounge. The party was
organised by students from the
Lycee Francais on the Cromwell
Road, who had booked the lounge
through the Union office.
Mile Pimentel became
unconscious after being violently
sick in the ground floor toilets of the
Union building. An ambulance was
called by College security after
attempts to revive the girl failed.
Imperial College Union (ICU)
members remained with the student
until medical help arrived.
Paramedics who arrived at the
scene said that the girl had
consumed large amounts of alcohol.
She was also believed to be mildly
concussed. Mile Pimentel was then
taken to the Accident and
Emergency department of Charing
Cross Hospital, accompanied by
two police officers. She was later
discharged.
The party in the Ents lounge was
stopped, and College and Union
security evacuated the room. Four
off-duty Union Stewards assisted in
the evacuation. After evacuation,
graffiti was noticed on the walls of
the Ents lounge, and Ents have
since reported a missing smoke
machine.
The organisers of the party were
French Lycee students who
arranged the event as a private
function. They stressed that there
was no connection between the
party and the Lycee Francais, and
that they invited some other non-
Lycee students as guests. The
organisers also insisted that entry
was refused to anyone who was
carrying alcoholic substances. A
search of the room afterwards
revealed large empty bottles of
'Merrydown' cider, and empty cans
of 'Strongbow Super' 8% dry cider.
Neither of these products are sold
in the two ICU bars.
The student's parents were
informed of the incident by
telephone, and arrived at the Union
building soon after the arrival of the
paramedic team. Students at the
party expressed shock at the
incident. College security reported
that some students attempted to
force re-entry to the Ents lounge
after the evacuation. A member of
College academic staff also
remarked on 'problems' caused by
ICU renting out rooms to other
colleges, including the Lycee
Francais and Richmond College.
French and German students
outside the Lycee Building on
Saturday were also reported to be
concerned at the incident. One
German student told Felix reporters
that the affair was 'typical of those
stupid Lycee students'.
As a result of the police
intervention on Saturday night, the
bar licensing officer telephoned
Mandy Hurford, Union Manager,
on Monday. A n internal Union
investigation was held at the start
of this week, and union stewards
were queried about the evening's
events. Felix understands that the
police accept the French student
party was a private affair, and that
there was no evidence that ICU bars
sold alcohol to any of the Lycee
students. The police further accept
that the party organisers attempted
to stop any consumption of alcohol
in the Ents lounge. Felix has been
told that the police and the licensing
officer will not be investigating the
matter further. ICU sabbaticals
have expressed their thanks to the
off duty Union stewards and other
students who assisted at the
incident.

Last week, up to three thousand people joined Teddy Taylor and Norris
Macwirter in a march on Hyde Park to callfor a Maastricht referendum.
Later Tony Benn spoke and a letter of support from Lady Thatcher was
read to the assembled crowd, (pic and story Lise Yates.)
Centre Prices
by J a c o b Andelin
Prices and dates for the refurbished
Imperial College Sports Centre
were finally confirmed this week.
Fees for 'one-off users have
actually decreased, although the
price of season tickets has
increased. M r Rick Bilby, ICU
Deputy President, who is part of the
Sports Centre Users Group, said
that,'it was the best deal we could
have got, and I think it's very fair'.
Mr Bilby himself had a hand in
reducing the price of the season
ticket to £27.00, which was
originally set at £48.00. Tha main
change remains the introduction of
streamed opening hours, in which
it becomes more expensive to use
the Sports Centre at busier times of
the day. Full details can be found
on the Sports page of this week's
Felix.
The Centre is set to open on the
15th of February, after having been
delayed for one and a half months.
Work on the new refurbishments
was originally due to start during
the third term of last year, ready for
opening at the start of this academic
year, but didn't actually start until
some time over the summer.
'Difficulties with the contractors'
was the official reason given for the
second delay, although it is
expected that there may be some
dispute with the contractors over
exactly who should shoulder the
blame for the delays.
Improvements to the centre
include an air-conditioned weights
gym, wet and dry changing rooms,
and a new health suite, comprising
of a sauna/steam room, needle
shower and Jacuzzi.
