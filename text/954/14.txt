Cairngorm here we come!
While all sane mortals were
sleeping off the excesses of
Christmas week, a dozen fearless
S&G-ers and some mountaineer
infiltrators were heading off to the
hinterland where even the Romans
dared not tread. To the home of the
original 'Real Man'—not afraid to
don a skirt and climb a mountain in
a lOOmph breeze. Yes! A wild and
windy week in the Cairngorm
mountains near to Aviemore was
the prospect.
It was a long journey, but light
relief was, as always, provided by
our glorious leader's driving and
navigational techique. Our home for
the coming week hove into view in
the late evening. A l l mod cons
including a wood burning air-
conditioning system (in case the
ambient Oc became stifling).
Dawn on Sunday saw all but the
most determined submarine
commanders amongst us dead to the
world. However periscopes soon
went up and a flurry of Gore-Tex,
fluffies, crampons and ice-axes later
we were being frog-marched to
battle fitness. Best laid plans...!
Winds that could have been fuelled
by Simon's Chili con Carne, beat
us back to the relative comfort of
the hut with not even a single
Munro in the bag. Epics had been
logged by the rest of the group who
went to investigate ski lifts at Cairn
Gorm. Cars were being rolled in the
car park with gusts of 150mph and
Auto Glass were rapidly filling the
pubs of Aviemore with their
customers, including ourselves.
Snow that evening gave some the
opportunity for moonlit Cross-
country skiing and skid pan
practise amongst the fallen trees.
An alpine start (5.30am) was
suggested to make best use of these
conditions. Pouring rain greeted
those who peered out at this time
and sent them scuttling back to the
warmth of their sleeping bags to
wait for a more godly hour—or at
least someone to bring them coffee
and porridge.
When at last the assembled
company fell in on the lower slopes
of Ciarn Gorm, a crack squad was
sent out to conquer the limited
quantities of vertical ice to be found
armed only with a pair of ice axes
and Boadicea style crampons. The
rest braved the spindrift for the
pleasure of throwing themselves
down the slopes of long snow fields
and building snowmen making sure
that they returned in good time
before the bar closed. The
honourable return of our intrepid
ice climbers came with but one
casuality—the dislocation of our
leader's shoulder from an 80ft fall
into snow.
An ambition to get our hands on
some ice, despite deteriorating
weather on Tuesday drove us onto
the huge Aviemore ice rink. A
certain prescience told us that
practise of crampon technique
would not be appreciated here.
Thus full body contact speed skating
races, that struck fear into the hearts
of the locals and terrorised the
toddlers, were organised as some
form of compensation. Hardier
members hired Mountain bikes and
tore up the highlands and byways
liberally scattering mud and
bimblers alike.
That evening was marked by the
discovery of that rarest of
species—a decent Scottish pub, with
more whiskys than can be imagined
and more than just a tap of Tartan
Special Brew. Despite our
indulgence a 5.30 start coincided
with a reasonable day the next
morning, so even the most
inexperienced of ice climbers set
out to give it a go. We were accused
of kitting up to climb Annapurna,
but this from people who had
forgotten how to tie onto a rope.
The day finished on a high with a
bright moon rising in clear skies for
an interesting final climb.
Buoyed by our success we were
up the next morning at 5.30...and
6.30...and 7.30 each time waiting
for a drop in the winds. None came.
A morning sat around the fire gave
plenty of time to put the world to
right from everyones' political point
of view (and always perfectly
gentlemanly—honest). A brighter
afternoon allowed the Rt Hon
Members for IC and Oxford Poly
out to cool off on a quick bimble
and a return to the ice rink. Further
casualties resulted from this foray,
as our treasurer received a broken
wrist in a rather ambitious
manoeuvre, which he treated with
his usual stoicism despite an
overnight stay in Inverness hospital.
His loss was our gain as that
evening we were to be treated to
whisky and haggis, neaps and tatties
followed by lashings of trifle,
tastefully served up in a washing-
up bowl.
On returning from the pub later
that night snow had set in with a
vengeance and the following morn
(at a reasonable hour) we went on
our way to the slopes with a spring
in our placcy booted step and a song
on our lips. It was soon wiped off
by the vicious wind that continued
to blow spindrift in our eyes, but
wonderful snow conditions on some
pistes more than made up for any
discomfort.
That final evening, discord set in
amongst the ranks as the 'let's
party' faction pitted their wits (or
rather volume) against the 'I'm
knackered, I want a quiet drink'
brigade. Fortunately not too much
was said in the heat of the moment
to spoil this most enjoyable of
weeks where some firm friendships
were made. Our thanks must go out
to Phil Wickens for making it such
a success and Simon Gubbins for
feeding the starving hordes so well
whilst retaining his customary good
humour.
