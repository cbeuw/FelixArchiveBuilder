Searching for the pot of gold
Alex Bell looks at the demise of one of Britain's longest running children's
TV programmes, Rainbow.
'A piece on Rainbow?! That band
with thefunny hair from the 70's ?'
'Erm, no... the children's
program. '
I'm even more bemused now.
Apparently unbeknown to me those
nasty people at Carlton, who won
Thames Television's franchise,
intend to let Zippy and George drift
off to puppet valhalla and Bungle
end up on somebody's hearth. But,
students at Heathrop College,
London have leapt to Rainbow's
defence and have launched 'The
Save Rainbow Campaign' in order
to attract someone to buy the
longest running children's program
in history, and restore it to
mainstream T V . At present, if a
buyer is not found, the nation's
under fives will have to ask mummy
and daddy for a satellite dish so they
can watch 20 year old repeats on
U K Gold at six in the morning.
I put it upon myself to find out
what the hell all the fuss was about.
Basically, when Carlton secured the
ITV franchise from Thames they
were free to pick and choose which
programs they wanted to buy and
those which they deemed
unsuitable, ie. that weren't good
money spinners, to be left out in the
cold.
In trying to get an official
comment, I got as far as a rather
bitter sounding lady at Thames who
told me that 'everybody here's been
made redundant because of
Carlton'. Carlton seemed to think
Thames were responsible and the
buck was passed on again. The plot
thickens perhaps? Has Rainbow met
its end as a result of the discovery
of disturbing and intimate details
regarding the private lives of the
shows stars? Has Zippy been
zipping up George 'Frank Bough'
style?
In your wildest dreams, readers,
or perhaps not, I suppose.
I spoke to Paul Shuttleworth who
alerted the masses to the plight of
the longest running children's
program in history with his piece in
The Daily Sport.
Q:Paul, how did it all start?
A:Well it was back in November at
Heathrop when somebody decided
to pass a motion to change the
names of common rooms 1, 2 and
3 to the Bungle, Zippy and George
common rooms. This was once
we'd gotten wind of Rainbow's
dilemma, but before it had actually
ended.
Q:Why is Rainbow in this situation?
A:When Thames lost its franchise
to Carlton it was no longer able to
show Rainbow. Although they do
still want to show it they can't until
somebody else buys it.
Q:And Carlton didn't?
A:Yeah, except come the Autumn
then what can happen is they can go
straight to the ITV network
controller and he can buy the
programme so the campaign is now
trying to make sure he does.
Q:Is it possible that they might
decide to replace Rainbow with a
more up to date format just as the
BBC did by replacing Play School
with Play Bus?
A:Well, Rainbow has been around
for almost twenty years now but it's
still a classic.
Q:Was there a big party at the end
of the last series?
A:No there was no party. I mean
that's it. Thames kept it very quiet,
in fact the only reason it got into the
press was that 'The Save Rainbow
Campaign' took it upon themselves
to tell them. Thames didn't want to
mention it at all.
Q:Is Jacquie Doyle-Price, the
leader of 'The Save Rainbow
Campaign', a mother herself?
A:No, she's a twenty two year old
student. Most of the people
involved in the campaign are in our
generation.
Q:So it's more to do with saving a
classic programme, than for the
sake of the children, the majority of
whose parents cannot afford to send
them to nursery school. Who would
be deprived of it?
A:Yeah, it's classic...also the way
Rainbow ended just pointed to the
fact that people don't care about
children's programmes in this
country. You know all the heavy
papers have loads of stuff about
current affairs and news and stuff
but nobody cares about children's
telly. There's a danger of any
quality that's left in children's
television diminishing as ITV
becomes more commercialised.
Q:Will the Rainbow team be
making any extra public
appearances to help promote the
cause?
A:Well they have been gutted and
they need time to compose
themselves, but they've been
getting rip roaring receptions at the
Bristol Hippodrome where they're
staring in Jack and the Beanstalk
and Geoffrey can't leave the theatre
without being mobbed by hundreds
of fans.
Q:As you see it now, what do you
think the programme's chances are?
