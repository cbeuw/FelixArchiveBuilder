Rugby firsts
Rugby seconds
The game started as a shambles
once again after a last minute rush
in the Union to try and gather
essential players. The Rugby club
notice board is next to the Union
bar!!!! Once we arrived at
Guildford we were pleased to find
that they had six substitutes and so
we were able to borrow a winger
- whom incidentally played better
than his opposite man. The rest of
our backs had a tremendous game
with an early, converted, try from
Stu Caterall. They didn't really
come back after that. A n early
penalty scored, as usual, by Lee
Jefferson, gave us a three point
buffer to work within. Dominance
was reconfirmed in the second half
with a try from Dave of Surrey Uni,
the only unconverted one, and later
with a try from Adam Wood
followed within seconds by another
storming run and try by Tim
Savigar.
The forwards flourishing back play
was probably due to the inspiration
of having a winger as second row.
Matt Good, John Cassidy and John
Roebuck were everywhere on the
pitch and Si Fuller and Mark
Jackson did a good job of
introducing Glenn Khoo to the
position of hooker. Captain Karl
Drage was 'Pissed off that his try
was disallowed, and that he had to
leave the field five minutes before
full time because he forgot how to
walk. Glenn also joined the touch
line after forgetting that giving fat
props lip gets you punched!
IC Rugby meet every Monday at 12
and Tuesday at 6 in the Union Gym.
Imperial went into the game at
Surrey knowing a good result was
crucial against the side who lost
124-3 to West London Institute,
IC's next opponents in the U A U .
IC started at a high tempo and,
still fresh, Fields scored after
Paynter's masterpiece of a kick.
The second try came soon after,
when Gillchrist crucified the
opposition defence after good work
from Ollie Dennison. Oliver twisted
his way through again, five minutes
after, to set up Bolton's wandering
run for the third.
Chris crossed for a telling try
after a Carr drive from a
breakdown, and George Habib
(who is good in bed) completed the
half s scoring.
In general, Montgomery
controlled the second half and after
Mark Baker's dozen attempts to
score, Carr went over for a try, set
up by Marquis (of Westminster) and
Corbett, who was harried into
passing.
IC relaxed after that and,
although Mark wished hearts were
bigger, IC scored their final try
after Steve (who was unhappy about
playing at the town's end) flung to
Flinn to score (and not with Karen
this time) his first IC try that left the
score 43-0 to IC.
