Easter
This week I received the first
complaint about the Easter Vacation
accommodation problem. For those
of you with short memories or who
were not here last year, a room in
Prince's Gardens is rented on a 34
or 39 week agreement. The shorter
one means, you have to move out
during the Easter vacation, but, also
that you pay less rent. Most first
years sign the 34 week contract to
save money. This is before they
realise they have exams straight
after Easter and have to watch their
possessions do a yoyo impression
in and out of their room, days
before important tests.
Easter is special because the
potential revenue from renting out
rooms for conference
accommodation is phenomenal.
Despite the fact that a week in
central London would not be my
favoured conference residence and
that Southside Halls are such a state,
few people would want to spend
more than a student rent to live in
them, still, the amount of money
raised by other Universities acts as
an irresistible bait to our
accommadation section.
Because the pressure to raise
money is so high, if you decided it
would be best to stay in London in
your own room before exams start,
it is very unlikely you will be
allowed .to do so. After all, you
have signed a contract which stated
you could only spend 34 weeks in
hall, so to change it would be
breaking a legal agreement.
Apparendy, each first year should
have had these conditions explained
to them before they arrived at
Imperial. Did you? I sincerely
doubt it and judging by the fact that
worries have begun to surface this
early in the spring term, I am not
alone. When will Residences start
to consider the students who live
most of the year in Halls, instead
of fly-by-night conference guests?
Could it be something to do with the
fact that it is in such debt that, the
cheapest and most aesthetic solution
would be to pull down all the
Prince's Gardens Halls?
Sex
According to a survey for Carlton's
good sex guide 56% of men have
orgasms each time they make love.
Ponder that one while you are in
your Friday morning lecture. I
thought the main problem with men
was, stopping them having the
bloody things.
Bow my Head
Since taking over as Felix Editor,
I have followed a policy of making
sure if any inaccuracies occur, they
are fully apologised for. Consistent
with that policy, there will be no
apology for the news story that
appeared in issue 953 entided 'Chris
slams G U C ' .
Professional Collating Machine
The shining star of my life, a
collating machine, that puts together
Felix every week had the audacity
to eat my hand earlier this week. As
divine retribution a lightning bolt
from the heavens struck it, causing
a vital component to break. As I
type, this replacement has yet to
arrive, so you may not be reading
this on Friday, or even Monday for
that matter! Sorry, but I'm sure
your lives will go on anyway. Don't
worry it's arrived, if you don't read
Felix on Friday it's all my fault.

Cat's Eyes
Madman
Two years after the Gulf War, the
allies finally decide to finish off
Saddam Hussein. Why did they
wait? Looking at the current state
of some of the allied countries, it
seems that they need, or rather their
leaders need, a spell of good
publicity. However fabulous and
exalted their images end up, I only
hope that they get him this time.
I'm not - hie - drunk
Was Chris Davidson blatantly
misleading the council at the last
College Council Meeting, when
denying the allegations that he was
rat-arsed and flying off at the jaw
at the last GUC meeting? Who do
you believe, several reliable sources
including some senior Sabbaticals,
who were all interviewed
independently, or Chris? If random
breath-testing at GUC meetings was
imposed on those who wished to
speak, it might help Chris to end his
problem.
Money, money, money
Patriot, Harrys' and Crying. What
word follows all three? Answer:
Game(s). This reflects film writers'
and directors' attitude to violence
making it a game with which they
amuse the public and line their
pockets. The Irish question, to most
of us is - quite literally - a deadly
affair, yet with a little gloss it can
be transformed into compulsive
viewing. It is a sad truth naturally
present in the entertainment
industry that the more violent the
death a particular character
undergoes, the more it boosts
viewing figures. It's about time the
industry showed violence as it truly
is: horrific, animalistic and
degrading.
Money, money, money
(again)
On the inauguration day of Bill
Clinton into the White House, a
celebration was held across
America (and no where else). The
figure allegedly spent was around
thirty million dollars. Do the
American populace expect a change
in their economy when the president
spends a fortune on a party? As the
saying goes, this could happen only
in America.
Fish - is this a title?
It seems that whenever surrealism
is mentioned/or .discussed, fish
always crop up. The two have
become inseparable since the
surreal movement in the 1920' s.
What are now regarded as classic
surreal paintings often contain
something resembling part of a fish,
if not a whole one. It must be a rule
among artists: To make something
surreal, add a fish. What would
otherwise be a good and possibly
interesting painting, becomes
foolish and absurd with the
introduction of a cod or a halibut.
Imagine what a famous painting
would look like if a surrealist
painter was let loose on it...
Normal version; the Mona Lisa
Surreal version; the Mona Lisa
clasping a fish
Very Surreal version; the Mona
Lisa wearing a fish patterned tunic
with matching headband, poised in
a room with a fish motif splattered
on the walls and floor, clasping a
fish in both hands.
Silly, isn't it.
Thanks
Thank you to Phillip H . and Chris
Davidson for being this weeks
inspiration.
