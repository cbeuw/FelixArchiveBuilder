IC vs Westfield 25-7
IC reached the final of the plate
competition with a resounding
victory over Westfield College.
IC totally dominated the first
seventy minutes, scoring twenty-
two points. Westfield then came
more into the game but never
looked like posing any problems
for a strong IC side.
Tries: A Ralph (2), S Philips
12 con, 3 pen\ M Thompson.
The final is on Sun Feb 27 at
Motspur Park, coaches leave at
12:30 and any support would be
welcomed.
IC vs Q M C 3-0
IC reversed their defeat by Q M C
earlier in the season in what
must have been one of our
hardest matchest to date. Some
rather weak refereeing resulted
in tempers being extremely
frayed and the forward battle
being just that. The half time
score was 0-0 but with IC having
had most of the territorial
advantage.
In the second half Steve
Philips redeemed himself after
missing a penalty in front of the
posts earier in the game by
knocking another one over for
the only score at a game in which
IC were deserved victors.
Best wishes to Phil and get a
better soon. (Phil left the game
in the first half with a pinched
nerve and suspect concussion).

IC vs Q M C 16-3
Wednesday was a rare day in IC
rugby history, as it marked the
welcome (?) return of 6ft, 17
stone 'man of i r o n ' J i m m y
H u t t o n , who, despite being
somewhat out o f practice,
immediately exerted a c o m -
manding authority over the
procedings. Naturally inspired
by such a god-like presence, the
team won 16-3. This score
included two tries, neither of
which was finished by diseased
Dave Magoo, though it was
noted that Q M C , forewarned of
Dave's afflication, wouldn't go
near him.
Notable performances came
from Mark 'the boot' Hudson,
who successfully put the ball
into orbit from various angles on
the pitch, and Mickey Winsor,
who, owing to an accident
involving a jar of vaseline before
the game dropped the ball every
time it came his way. (Except
when he scored the first try.)
Thanks are due to D o u g
Kelly, who refereed under very
difficult circumstances (he didn't
know the rules).
After the game, the team
retired to the bar for a pint of
orange squash before returning
home a m i d cires of 'more
horlicks', 'less beer' 'more
problem sheets', 'less curry' in
order to do a good evening's
work and thereby get better
degrees. This is true (honest).

IC vs Harlow
There was a mixed team from
IC,
A splendid group you'll agree,
We drew two-all,
And had a good maul,
(NB No B A this time, OK)
I'd better stop here before it gets
worse.

IC vs Royal Dental Hosp 1-1
IC Seconds put in a spirited if
patchy performance against an
enthusiastic opposition. This
followed a shaky opening twenty
minutes which culminated in a
goal from R D H . Inspired there-
after by the wrath of Burns and
the skills of Rickard IC began to
dominate, but nevertheless still
trailed at the interval. In the
second half R D H found them-
selvers under persistant pressure
and were powerless to prevent
Rickard from scoring casually
following a Rimmer miskick
FELIXI
Unable to score what would
have been a deserved winner,
due to squandered chances, the
side was nonetheless not too
disconsolate to make a 'Wim-
bledon by Night' sally. The
lingering reminiscence will be
Rimmer's rendenng of 'Hawaii
Five O' on the 8:55 to Upminster
inducing unsuppressible mirth in
all present.
Imperial College C C C though
pre-occupied with the organisa-
tion, were confident of i m -
proving last year's dismal 74th
position in the Hyde Park Road
Relay. Jon Lea, the man in form,
ran an excellent first leg in just
over five minute miling, putting
us well inside the top fifty.
Graham Harker and Rob Morri
son both ran respectable laps
considering the very cold wind
and numerous obstacles (dogs,
footballs, etc) to be avoided.
Next came Nigel Fenwick who
' overcame the potential problems
of running in the new IC vest
and without ideal race prepara-
tion, putting in another sixteen
minute lap. The last two laps
were completed speedily by the
stars of the team Andy Griffiths
and Hugh Dixon. Both had
already run a lap for U L and
Hugh kindly saved his fastest lap
for us giving us a pleasing 39th
position overall. Unfortunately,
there was not enough time for
race organiser Bruce Bricknell to
rustle up an improver's cup.
On arrival at IC many women
found themselves looking for a
demanding, undiscriminating
sport which would maintain
their feminity while not insulting
their intelligence. Many con-
sidered taking up wrestling but
rejected the idea due to the lack
of mud. The most obvious
choice of course, was rugby; this
gave them the opportunity to
develop stamina, agility and ball
handling techniques.
Under Jim's guidance we have
explored a whole new dimension
in rugby which has involved
extensive field study and the
CCUs rugby sevens tournaments
have given us ample opportunity
to try our new techniques.
Intense strudy has been placed
into scrummaging tactics and we
have concluded from our in- .
vestigations that earnibbling is
not appreciated by the opposi-
tion's girlfriends and nipple
tweaking is titilating fun.
Our greatest achievement to
date was when we came third in
the RCS Sevens. At one stage we
were accused of having too
many players on our side, but we
assure you that the seven roving
F E L I X reporters were just as
much a hinderence to us as they
were the other side. Throughout
the tournament a great sense of
achievement was gained by side
stepping 6ft by 6ft, gut-ridden
slobs (commonly known as
rugby players) and plunging
over the try line to the raptuous
applause of both members of the
crowd.
Hopefully this article has
given you some insight into the
delights of ladies rugby. Let me
stress that we are not at all
discriminatory, in fact anyone
with slightly feminine tendencies
can play. If you are interested in
joining our team come along to '
the practise on Thursday, we
meet at 12:50 in Beit Quad.
