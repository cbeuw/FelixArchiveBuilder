Hit Squad
Swing Vote
A Guilds Hit Squad invaded a
General Union Council meeting
on Tuesday night, and after
'hitting' members of the ULU
Exec, stayed to vote on a contro-
versial motion.
The G U C , which is the Coun-
cil of the University of London
Union, had been in session in the
U L U Building for some time
when the squad of three Guilds-
men, attired in white coats,
helmets and scarves, entered the
meeting. John Passmore, G U C
Chairman and an ex-President
of I C U , remained remarkably
calm and requested the members
of the squad to wait until the end
of the meeting, but they moved
through the delegates and hit
U L U President Chris Sale and
Vice-President Jim Bryce with
plates of shaving foam. Later,
they meted out the same treat-
ment to the other V P , Louise
Barnes.
The meeting then went on to
vote on a motion to dismiss the
Chairman of the International
Affairs Committee. The motion
was passed by four votes out of
the sixty-odd present; subse-

thus no longer be paid.

Reactions to the report have
so far ranged from the skeptical
to the \t\r- -"MIQUS. Nick Pyne, a

which will be considering the

March 23, claimed that full
implementation of the report
would result in a 100% increase

ity of three, then one. A Poll
Vote was called, and as only six
of the Imperial delegation of
eight were present, two members
of the hit squad were made
temporary delegates. The mo-
tion was then passed on the Poll
by three votes.
Guilds Union officers declined
to reveal who had hired the Hit
Squad, but the general feeling
among the delegates was that
John Passmore had remained
suspiciously calm throughout
the meeting. M r Passmore
refused to make any intelligble
comment on the subject.
Simon Rodan, the I C U Ex-
ternal Affairs Officer described
the meeting as 'boring'.
Water!
Cold water is now intermittently
available in Soutfiside Halls
once more as Estates are filling
up the tanks from Linstead
mains supply. This temporary
solution has been adopted by
College in order to restore the
water supply after the cut caused
by a burst pipe in Exhibiton
Road last Saturday. A l l South-
side Halls, Linstead extension,
52 and 53 Prince's Gate and
some student flats were affected
by the cut. John Smith, the
College Secretary, said at a

media meeting on Tuesday that
even in view of a settlement of
the dispute, the supply for
Southside would not be in full
w o r k i n g order for at least
another week, while repairs go
ahead. However, the connection
with Linstead, which had not
been envisaged by M r Smith on
Tuesday, has eased the situation
somewhat. It is hoped that the
k
h o t water supply should be
running by early today.
The main danger, according
! to M r Smith, is that of fire.
Extra fire extinguishers have
been supplied enabling residents
to use the kitchens which had to
be closed last Saturday. South-
side Refectory is due to open
again today, after being closed
for a week during which an
alternative was offered by
opening the Sherfield Refectory.
It seems that, unless Northside
supply is cut off before the
weekend, the situation should
return to normal soon provided
sufficient care is taken to
preserve water. M r Smith has
asked students to be particularly
on their guard against fire.
