Post mortem: an unfortunate
and uncharacteristic defeat for
the Firsts while the rest of the
teams suffered from selection
problems (bouts of influenza
and c o n t i n u i n g away match
syndrome). M y apologies to the
Fifths for incorrect date.
The: jumpers have now arrived
(hookah!); it would seen that
KaroPs botany wool affair has
been holding up delivery of the
whole order. However post-
match culinary delights (chick-
en, jacket spuds, and beans)
following ICX's shock victory
over a combined IC2/3 team (4-
2). This was not paid for out of
Squash Club funds, incidentally.
The Guilds' trip to Dundee
was cancelled as it turned out.
On F r i d a y evening however
R S M annihilated Camborne 5-0
w i t h H o w a r d B i l l s beating
CSM's no. 1 9-0, 9-0, 9-0. This
Sunday R S M take on other U K
Mining Colleges in Nottingham.
That R S M has the best mining
college squash team in the entire
universe is however no longer in
doubt.
Another date for the diary is
squash club's night out (Mk 2).

second in 10m 46s, just one
second behind the winners and
winning their status group with
ease. The senior B coxless four
came fourth overall and won
their section by a considerable,
20 second margin.
In the coxed fours event,
despite an attempt by Nick
Hartland to avoid racing by
leaving his oar in the boathouse
at Putney, and being late on the
start, the elite coxed four came
first with the fifth fastest time of
the day, just one second behind
the senior B coxless four. The
ladies also entered a couple of
crews who were disappointing
ly beaten.
This brings the total number
of wins for the club this year to
23 which is by far the highest
number at this stage for many
years with the main regatta
season still to come.
The B o a t C l u b once again
proved themselves to be one of
the top sports clubs in IC by
taking three of the top five
places at Henley Four's Head on
Saturday, and winning all the
categories that they had been
entered for.
The race was timed over a 2 ' / 4
mile course including the famous
Henley regatta course, and was
won by Leander Club's elite
coxless four with Imperial's
senior A coxless four coming
IC vs Avery Hill
A possible victory was thrown
away in the dying stages of the
match at Avery Hill on Monday
night. A two point lead with six
minutes to go was lost with
disorganised defensive play and
wasted offensives.
We were on top of half time
and with a more experienced
side we could have probably
held on. Some incredible referee
decisions, and a lost contact lens
contributed to our defeat.
A g a i n it was left to K e n
Jarrett to make a large percen-
tage of our score (22 points), but
as he said after the game: "no
satisfaction is obtained from
scoring points unless it helps
the team to a good perfor-
mance."
W i t h o n l y a h a n d f u l o f
matches left this season all we
can hope to do now is salvage a
bit of pride.
Team: Frank Rawlins, Tim

'Let's get back to the basics.
Maybe if we all learnt how to
pass and catch the ball we might
be able to play the game pro-
perly.' These were the words of
our 'distinguished' player-coach
Alan Smith after the match at
Kingston Poly on Wednesday
evening. He was also top scorer
W W — — February 25, 1983
Last week saw a resurgence of
the organisational competance
of our leader, Steve Harrison.
(Club Capt, contact via Elec Eng
letter-racks) with advances on
several fronts: notably transport
to Bisley for our annual C C U
event and other, unspecified,
activities. Steve is the latest R P C
'hack' to get knocked out of the
handicap competition, leaving
Andrew Hamilton to walk over
Tim HIggs in the semi-final.
Andrew's adversary in the final
is to be decided in a needle
match between Mark Bourke
and Gary Smith.
The m a r k s m a n frsts last
Wednesday proved to oe more
difficult than many had en-
visaged with both Mark and
Gordon making a total balls-up
of it. Also last week due to a
small administrative error, ie a
dyslexic match secretary, some
competition cards got mixed up
and the offending gentleman had
a lot of explaining to do.
A serious matter has come to
my attention this week. It seems
that one (or more) potential
marksmen are using the effect of
a well-known after shave (splash
it on all over, eh Tim?) to
produce nausea and double
vision amongst other, more
sensitive shooters. This very
dubious practise must stop
because, as a side effect, is is
causing members to eat and
drink more, resulting in the
growth of beer guts. The source
of the offending odour must be
attacked by everyone in order to
curb this problem.
Next Sunday sees the first trip
of the year to Bisley with the
practise session for the Court-
man Shield the highlight of the
day. W i l l all those selected
The Sailing Club forsook their
normal mode of transport in
favour of a quiche eater's Fiesta
1.1. This needed slight modific-
ation before it was willing to
transport the whole of the team
and the more u n d e s i r a b l e ,
unnecessary peices were aban-
doned in Biet.
The team arrived in Exeter on
Saturday night, and by the time
sailing started on Sunday looked
slightly the worse for ' O l d
Wallop' and much the worse for
being expected to reassemble the
boats in the fog and then
actually Sail given the tempera-
ture was only crawling above
freezing grudgingly.
The racing in fact turned out
to be some of the most interest-
ing this term. The wind filled
sufficiently to give good team
racing conditions, and the teams
were sufficiently evenly matched
to make a bit of a fight of it, even
if, as is almost i n e v i t a b l e ,
considering the style and mod-
esty of the team, we w o n !
However it should be said that
since they had offered us
hospitality we let them win the
first race and then ourselves won
the other two.
In a nail biting finish the
charabang was returned to 'Car
Drop' in the condition in which
it had been requested—devoid of
petrol. This despite the immense
number of the time the Christ-
mas like economy lights were
illuminated on the dashboard,
and the uncool ideas of occa-
sionally stalling the beast in the
middle of the Great Wester"
Road.
Team: Andy, Graham, Jim,
Pat, Richard.
There will be an A C C match
(exec verses the club captains) on
Tuesday evening at 6:30pm in
the U D H . A guest appearnce
will be made by a certain Shirley
Templar and, if lucky, members
exec will reveal bare flesh!!
Don't miss it.
