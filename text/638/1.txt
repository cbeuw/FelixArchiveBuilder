Morning Cloud
Sinks
The Conservative Society Review
has been banned by Council under
new publicity rules passed only
two weeks ago. ICU Honorary
Secretary, Andy Grimshaw,
imposed the ban because in his
opinion 'Morning Cloud' con-
tained material offensive to
several minorities in College.
On Monday February 14, M r
Grimshaw saw the magazine in
the F E L I X Office where it was
being prepared for circulation
around the College. A t that
evening's Council meeting, a
motion was passed extending the
p u b l i c i t y rules c o n c e r n i n g
posters to all forms of publicity,
including leaflet distribution,
and M r G r i m s h a w then in-
formed the Council that under
the new rules 'Morning Cloud'
would be banned. No objection
was made, despite the presence
of Paul S i m i o n , E d i t o r of
'Morning Cloud', on Council.
Martin S Taylor, manager of
the Union Print Unit, expressed
his tjrprise that he was not
informed of the decision since at
the time of th; Council meeting
the leaflets had not been printed.
Conservative Society could have
saved themselves about £15 in
printing costs if M r Simion had
stopped the order.
Mr Simion had expressed the
desire to go 'over the top' with
this year's publication, and
opinion throughout the Union
seems to be that he has done so,
especially in attacks on WIST
and the C N D .
Under the existing publicity
ruio, any material for publica-
tion has to meet with the
approval of the Union Publicity
Officer or Hon Sec, but blanket
approval is normally given
unless something is obviously
offensive. Consoc will not be
fined, M r Grimshaw said, but
they will only be allowed to
circulate the review to members
of their society.

HALL SAVINGS PLANNED
Cuts in the numbers of security
guards, wardens, sub-wardens and
messengers are all recommended
in the report on Student Resi-
dence at Imperial, published this
week. The report also urges
College to discontinue its subsidy
of residences, which, informed
sources say, could double rents
within two years.
Specific recommendations for
the Halls of Residence are that
Weeks H a l l be made post-
graduate only; that Linstead
should be made into a full
catering iiali where residents
would have to pay for two meals
a day and three at weekends, and
that guest rooms should be used
as regular student rooms where
possible. The number of security
guards in ?rince's Gardens (the
complex of Week., Li^stead,
Southside and Garden* Halls)
should be reduced from four to
two, whose salaries would come
from rents, and that there should
be no day-time messengers in
Weeks, Garden or Linstead
Ha:::. TJ«£ linen service should
be reinstated next year if
demand is high enough, and the
cost of Hall laundry facilities
would be increased in line with
the price of the Central Laund-
erette when it is installed.
Mr Lauwerys, who is a Senior
Assistant Secretary in Admini-
stration, was commissioned by
College Secretary John Smith to
produce the report, but nearly
half of the fifty-eight recom-
mendations in the ninety-page
report are for further enquiries
and investigations iru^, specific
points to be carried out. The
major policy recommendations
are that 125 new places in
College accommodation be
found by 1985 to ensure places
for all new undergraduate and
postgraduate students; alloca-
tions to re-applicant, welfare,
Union and medical places would
be cut.
The report also recommends
that (subject to a proposal from
the Estates Secretary) the
standard of accommodation at
the student houses in Evelyn
Gardens be raised. Beyond this,
the Houses receive little specific
attention in the report. What
does receive space, however, is
the Summer Letting Scheme and
the use of Linstead Hall as a
conference centre; conference
facilities should be extended,
with the prime object being
income rather than the conveni-
ence of College or students.
Students working on the Sum-
mer Letting Scheme would be
employed only if they were
willing to work overtime when
required.
Most controversial are M r
Lauwerys' plans for increased
centralisation of the system, with
a smaller number of Wardens
and Sub-Wardens responsible to
a Residential Services Manager,
who M r Lauwerys recommends
