FRIDAY 2100h VIEWPOINT This is IC Radio's new* magazine
programme. It is basically an extension of LIVE FROM SIX and
will usually contain a review of the week's news.
2200h A very different kind of show presented by Ajay
and whoever else happens to be around. Usually involves
an 'outside link' from somewhere in Southside with a roving
reporter on the end of a microphone.
SATURDAY 1800-2000h IC RADIO CHARTSHOW presented
by Ajay: A look at new and current music followed at
1845h by a rundown of the IC Radio Top 20, compiled from
the week's most-played singles.
SUNDAY 1300h ALICE'S RESTAURANT MASSACRE
SHOW presented by Bob; You've seen the film, heard the
album, now listen to the radio show.
1500h LINKS, presented by Dave Waik , T try rerorri is
linked with the one before, starting and finishing (aboui 25
records later) with the same group.
1900h VERY EASY LISTENING presented by Chris Martin.
Good music interspersed with intellectual humour.
2100h WALK BETWEEN THE RAIN DROPS presented by
Neil Sykes. A concept programme that's enough to put you
off conception for life.
220h Victoria Harley takes you gently out of a Sunday night.
