Mourning
Cloud
Dear FELIX Editor
As a mere ellitirat siense
student, I feel I must write to
congratulate the Conservative
Soc on their new concept in
political pamphlets. Until now I
have had great difficulty in
reading these sorts of leaflets,
with Jong words in them like
' m u n i t i v i s m ' , and 'nooklear
detterent'; and also their com-
plicated filiosofical arguments
full of political jargon and
teknical terms, which I don't see
how I could possibly be expected
to understand. That was, until
Monday morning when I had the
oppurtunity to pick up and read
the 'Norning Cloud'.
Now there are some who
would say that we siense and
teknology students are incabel of
creative and original writing, but
the editor of the ' M o r n i n g
C l o u d ' has certainly proved
them wrong. Did he let himself
be tied down to facts, or attempt
to express a logical argument for
his policies? Of course not, for
how tedious this would have
been.
I n s t e a d as an a r g u m e n t
against 'unilateralism', we got
suttle inuendo (well it wasn't
that suttle really, asotherwise it
would have been above my
head), that these silly women at
Greenham Common are a load
of lesbians.
And I'd never have realised
before that these nasty WIST
people (in collaboration with the
Christian Union etc) were out to
destroy my Freedom of Choice
to go and see pornographic
events. It's this sort of right that
makes one proud to be British. I
suppose that WIST must have
been put to it by the K G B .
I am shure that at this rate, the
editor of the pamfflet will be
able to l o o k f o r w a r d to a
promising career as a political
comentator on that respected
jernal 'the Daily Star'.

Copies of this letter have been
sent to: the wonderfully coura-
geous Mrs M Thatcher and the
Minister of State for Education
and Science.
Dear Martin
A rather cruel and sinister
joke has been played on our
most upright and honourable
Consoc. There is a foul plot
afoot to discredit its name.
There may even be Russian
agents holding committee posts.
For on Monday 21 Feb I
spotted a piece of propoganda
that tries to undermine, without
any hesitation to use knee to the
groin tactics, our most holy
Consoc.
These are honourable gentle-
men, fighters for our freedoms.
They deserve all the respect due
to them. We must stand behind
them in their hour of need, we
must defend them to the last, we
will fight on the beaches....
'Morning Cloud— A Conser-
vative Review' is a leaflet that
tries to give the impression, to
the unknowing readers, that
Consoc members are ignorant,
thoughtless, prejudiced bloody
twits with nothing better to do
than waste money, effort and
time in producing an insulting
and mindless piece of garbage.
Of course this is very, very far
from the truth. It is libellous and
indeed contemptible. The moral
and intellectual standards of
Consoc members are in direct
contrast with this discrediting
bog paper. These are honourable
gentlemen, following in the
footsteps of so many great
leaders.
We must defend this great
bastion of our Empire, we must
save this institution from the
Reds. We must stop this before
it is too late.
Long live our great leader! Up
Magaret Thatcher.
Yours sincerely

STOIC
Elections
Dear Sir
Can our Union afford up to
£400 to rerun a sabbatical
election that is inqourate?
That is what will happen
unless at least 25% of full union
members vote in each sabbatical
election.
Such a requirement has
n o t h i n g to do with either
democracy or common sense. I
urge all those who wish to avoid
this situation arising to support
my motion to amend the Voting
Schedule at the next U G M .
Yours faithfully
J.P.Stanley
Dear Martin
F E L I X really does scent to he
fulfilling its aim of bringing real
news to its readership these days.
It was certainly news to nie to
find that I am to be STOlC's
Hon Sec next year, as stated in
your 'Below The Belt' column
last week. I'll grant you the fact
that I was standing, uncontested,
for this post when the 'report'
was written but. since then,
another candidate (eoineSden-
tally, a regular visitor to the
F E L I X Office) has also been
proposed.
Another thing: that statement
about the S T O I C committee
posts having been settled last
Christmas—the words were
taken right out of my mouth...
before I had the chance to utter
them myself. Honestly, Martin,
do you always use smear cam-
paigners as informants? It would
have been an incredibly stupid
statement to make, as in an
electorate the size of STOIC's
membership, any form of vote
fiddling that this action could
entail would be easily detected.
The article went on to impli-
cate the r e t u r n i n g officer,
Lawrence Windley, in activities
likely to bias the election results.
Reference was made to the fact
that he has stipulated three
seconders for each candidate (as
in previous years) as opposed to
the constitutional two. Does this
really matter? If a candidate
can't find three people to second
him/her, I can't see that it's
really worth his/her time stand-
ing for a post.
Your error coefficient was
quite impressive in the other
STOIC article too, but I'm sure
that you'114iear more about that
from other sources.
Yours sincerely

The Need
For Religion
Dear Editor
Roger Kingdon's 'The Need
For Religion' presents religion
as a kind of moral drug which is
the only cure for the 'world's
problems'—be they personal •
(lack of self-confidence), polit-
ical (world government), econ-
omic or social. Moreover, the
drug comes in various forms
(pills, injections, ointments...).
You can make your choice in
The Drugstore of Religions
which is set up to solve the
problems of the future!
To choose our beliefs with the
aim to further our future seems
to me an obvious act of self-
d e c e p t i o n . T h i s n o t i o n o f
religion as a means to survival
and establishment of a future
Utopian world ignores the claim
of religion to represent objective
truth and a complete life trans-
action. It simply reduces religion
to a psychological strategy for
lacing life. Our beliefs can have a
valid foundation only if they are
motivated by a desire for truth
and understanding our relation-
ship with the Creator.

I Won't
Stand For It
Dear Martin
I am writing to explain my
decision not to stand for I C U
President this year. The decision,
let me assure you, has been very
difficult indeed. There are many
things I would have lilced to
have set in motion next year to
try and improve the service the
union provides and to improve
the often barren social life at IC.
As the editor of Guildshit put it,
I have students' interests at
heart.
The reasons for deciding
against standing I must confess
are purely selfish.I do not feel I
ought to waste another year (I
took one out between school and
IC) before embarking on a
career. The experience, I have
been assured, though useful,
would in my situation be largely
superfluous. On top of this is the
fact that it may even be detrimen-
tal to my career, for though IC
Union is very different from
most student unions many
people in industry do not draw
the distinction between student
and trade unions and I might
possibly be held up by this
labelling.
I would like to express my
thanks to all those who have
encouraged me to r u n for
president and apologise if I have
let anybody down through my
decision. Finally, to the success-
ful candidate I extend my best
wishes for what will without
doubt be a very difficult year
ahead, and wish him or her the
best of luck.
Yours sincerely
Simon Rodan
