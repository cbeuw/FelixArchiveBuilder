Hustings U G M
Next Thursday is the Hustings
U G M where the various candi-
dates for the four sabbatical
posts (Union President, Deputy
President, Honorary Secretary
and F E L I X Editor) each make a
speech and answer questions
from the floor in an effort to
convince you that they are the
ones who should run the Union
next year.
This U G M is the most impor-
tant of the year. Sabbaticals cost
the U n i o n something over
£20,000 a yeai. and if you want
to make sure this money is well
spent, it is essential that you get
informed on the aptitude of the
various candidates before you
EDITORIAL
vote. The best way of doing this
is by direct contact, either by
asking searching questions when
they come canvassing at your
door or by seeing how they face
up to interrogation during the
Hustings U G M .
Since the U G M is likely to go
on for quite a while, Peter Mee,
the College Registrar, has agreed
to cancel all lectures etc from
2:30 to 3:30 on Thursday to
enable you to attend. Don't
waste the opportunity to find
out about the candidates—but if
you do, don't complain about
next year's Exec.
Ballot Boxes
If anyone wants to earn £1.50 an
hour on Monday and Tuesday,
March 7 and 8, they can earn
this princely sum by guarding a
ballot box during the sabbatical
elections. Volunteers to the
Union Office, please.

I N O T E WITH much amuse-
ment that the Archangel Teller
has kept strictly to her word over
the forthcoming elections. Last
year, you may remember, she
was an obvious candidate for
Deputy President but astonished
the world by refusing to stand,
announcing that this was because
of the likelihood of having to
work under Stephen Goulder, a
burden she considered intoler-
able.
This year she publicly an-
nounced that she would not be
standing for a sabbatical post,
although no one believed her.
But she has kept her word and
has not stood for a sabbatical
post; she has stood for two.
Originally she put her name
down for President, out when
she discovered who the opposi-
tion was. she quickly withdrew
her nomination and stood for
Deputy President instead. Plus
ca change
O N E O F T H E M O R E carelessly
worded clauses in the Union
election rules demands thar

names of al! the candidates.
Since nominations have not yet
closed 1 have no way of knowing
who else will stand for Deputy
President; there's even time for
Christine to change her mind
again, and stand for Honorary
Secretary or F E L I X Editor.
Nevertheless in order to stay on
the right side of the Elections
Committee I feel bound to tell

are also standing in the Deputy
Presidential election.
M O R E A N D M O R E hacks are
becoming disillusioned with
F E L I X H B B M H H
B E L O W
Ifidfeb
Andy Grimwash as Honorary
Secretary; some have even
advanced the heretical notion
that had he been treated as badly
as Mary Freeman, he would
have made even more of a mess
of the job than she did. A recent
incident shows that even Andy
himself may be losing faith in his
credibility:
The F E L I X Editor is gene-
rally happy to allow U n i o n
Officers space in the Union
newspaper, and so when Andy
asked Martin for a half page, the
request was gladly granted.
Martin was rather surprised,
though, to see Andy filling the
allotted space not with a report,
as is customary, but with a
supposedly humorous quiz. And
he was decidedly put out to see it
signed pseudonymously and
entitled 'The F E L I X Q u i z ' .
Consequently he told Andy that
it would be changed to 'The Hon
See's Quiz'. Apparently he took
::.. ;. jnke, because on Friday
nieirning a white-faced Andy
Grimshaw burst into the F E L I X
Office brandishing a copy of the
quiz. 'How dare you put my
name to this?' he screamed.
'Now no one will read it!'
This week he has been getting
worked up over the other half of
his dual job, that of returning
officer. He has decided, with his
normal excess concern for trivia,
to stamp out with ruthless
de'ernination any possibility of
an "unfair advantage' for any
candidate, or even any potential

the 'unfair advantage' imparted
at the Dirty Disco last Tuesday
when a startlingly scant costume
revealed most of Gaynor Lewis'
figure (but showed nothing of
Chris Boyd, Julian Ranger, .'hii
Nathan or Jon Barnett, the other
presidential candidates.)
Nick Pyne is a marked man
for G r i m w a s h ' s p e t t i n e s s ,
probably because he has con-
sistently refused to tell Union
staff whether he is standing for
election or not. So when Nick
wrote a letter to F E L I X , Andy
was most concerned lest Nick
should accrue some advantage
over his opponents oy this; he
even suggested that we should
refuse to print the letter, or at
least append the names of the
others who are standing for any
post Nick might possiHy be
considering standins? for.
Nick seized on his change for
revenge on Tuesday afternoon.
As usual, Exec News had
arrived at the F E L I X Office too
late for the copy deadline (one of
the reasons Mary Freeman was
sacked, inc'dentallvl anH <
;
n it
fell to M r Grimwash to prepare
the artwork. Unfortunately he
was too busy, and so delegated
the job to a reluctant Nick Pyne
who, since he is a final year
student who sits on numerous
Union comrt'tte'** " i H r"ii« only
three job interviews this week, has
much more time than a sabba-
tical officer who is paid the
equivalent of £6,000 a year to
find time for such things. Nick
did the job and asked Andy to
proof-read it. Andy was too
busy even for this, and so it was
not until five thousand Exec
Newses had been printed ih.il he
saw to his horror the •
< V
'Vote Nick Pync for H..-,orary
February 25,19831
Secretary' taking up half of the
back page. His fury was gratify-
ing to behold, particularly since
it was aggravated when the
F E L I X staff refused to be
perturbed, and didn't even
consider this tactic unfair at all.
What Andy didn't realise (and
won't realise until he reads this)
is that four thousand nine
hundred and ninety four Exec
Newses have a totally innocuous
spacefiller on the back page, and
precisely six were specially
printed with the inflammatory
advertisement, just to annoy our
rather petty Honorary Secretary.
Nick Pyne told me* before the
start of term that he had decided
not to stand for a sabbatical
post. I wonder if the election
rules imply that I should name
all others who are also not
standing.
A N D W H Y do you suppose
Andy Grimwash was too busy to
produce Exec News? What vital
a p p o i n t m e n t kept h i m and
Stephen Goulder away from the
U n i o n Office all Wednesday
afternoon? U n i o n staff have
refused to tell, so I shall: They
were moonlighting, earning £18
each serving food to delegates at
a meeting in the Albert Hall.
Apparently the staff, knowing
that there are no lectures at IC
on Wednesday afternoons, had
asked the Union if any students
would be willing to supplement
their grants for an afternoon's
w o r k . Messrs G o u l d e r and
Grimshaw, always keen to pick
up some extra cash on the side,
generously volunteered their
own services for the job. M r
Gouder later spoke of how he
had enjoyed the experience.
This certainly pays better than
being a sabbatical,' he chortled.
