Socialist Society demonstra-
tion against University of
London's involvement with S
Africa. Many colleges in
London have also been invited
to participate in this event.
(Also other universities and
polytechnics in and outside
London.) This will hopefully
be a large demonstration with
the intention of drawing the
public attention to our univer-
sity's different involvements
with South Africa and therefore
its support for apartheid. One
reason for it being at IC is the
heavy involvement through
RSM.

Attention all Record Owners
If you have any records you
thought were lost due to layers
of garbage (eg microdust,
dried coffee, Blu Tack etc
accummulated over the vears.
think again. Audio Soc will be
hiring a NITTY GRITTY disc
cleaner so for just 15p (includ-
ing a new plastic-lined sleeve
without which cleaning would
be pointless), this professional
clean will reach the parts other
beers couldnt reach. This is a
chance to pay attention to
perhaps the most neglected
part of the Hi-Fi system: don't
miss it. March 3-5 Thursday
1300-1900h; Friday 1300-
1900h; and Saturday 1000-
1800h in the Union Senior
Common Room.

could be your chance to hear
the technology claimed to
make records obsolete. Is this
just more hype or is the
recording industry as we know
it about to be revolutionised?
