Sick Bay
Savings
Dear Martin
Before everyone rushes for
their medical insurance refund,
after being incited to do so by
Messrs. Nathan and Trevor-
Jones, 1 would like to put
forward a few points.
As I understand from the
lenghty discussions last year on
the compulsory insurance sch-
eme, it was found to be the best
way of saving the sick bay which
was having financial difficulties
due to withdrawal of College
funds. The voluntary insurance
c o u l d not p r o v i d e enough
money to finance the sick bay.
The sick bay is a vital part of
the services offered by the health
centre and is very necessary in
the University situation.
There are many reasons why
students use the sick bay. For
example those catching infect-
ious viruses e.g. chicken pox, can
be close to college (and lectures
tutors etc) instead of going
home. If this occurs during the
exam period, as happened in my
case last year, it is possible to
take exams in the sick bay. These
facilities are free for those with
the medical insurance (I think it
costs about £4-£6 per day to
keep someone in the sick bay).
During the Exam period last
year there was a high turnover of
people in the sick bay. So I don't
think the number of students
using it is very small.
The idea to just make the
scheme compulsory to Hall and
House residents was because it
was impossible to implement in
any other way and as college is
trying to let everyone have a year
in college, then there will be
very few who do not pay.
As it is impossible to predict
whether or not illness will strike
in the 3 years at college, it is
a d v a n t a g e o u s to have the
medical insurance. For the sick
bay to survive, the compulsory
medical insurance must also
survive. If not, then there will be
many students who will have
their studies seriously impaired
by illness.
Yours sincerely

Dear Martin,
• With elections approaching it
is somewhat of a tradition for
sabbatical candidates to do
everything possible to associate
themselves with the body of
student o p i n i o n . This year,
however, has seen a letter to
F E L I X full of such utter hog-
wash as we have never before
had to endure. I refer, of course,
to Phil Nathan's letter regarding
the £12 levy raised this year on
hall bills under the heading
'Health Centre'.
We see M r Nathan suggesting
that we are contributing to a
'private health scheme' which is
'doubtful in l a w ' , that this
should be the 'responsibility of
all students' etc etc.
May I now point out some of
the facts. The levy of £12 is to
cover the provision of a sick bay
— the health centre as a whole
has always been (and w i l l
continue to be) an N H S facility.
The scheme worked out is as fair
as possible — once set up (over a .
three year period) then only j
those who spend no time in ;
College accomodation (princip- ,
ally those who live at home and
consequently have no need for
the sick bay) will not be covered
so yes all students are (or will be)
paying for it.
What, though, is the alter-
native? The U G C has specific-
ally stated that such things
should not be funded by the
colleges. So perhaps only those
who use the sick bay should pay?
Tough luck — estimates run as
high as £20 per night even to get
near to breaking even, and very
soon, I ' m sure, M r Nathan
would complain about charges
on that scale!
Finally, a few closing ideas.
In M r Nathan's letter we see
(though it is well hidden) the
implicit point that the author
would rather see the sick bay
close than have a pitiful £12 levy
to keep it open. Surely this
smacks of hypocrisy — weren't
the very same people decrying
the removal of the linen service
so very recently? A n d for those
of you demanding your £12
back, I can only say I hope that
you have to spend a few days in
the sick bay at full cost.
The sick bay represents without
a doubt a valuable and necessary
facility. Surely it's worth (less
than) one pint every three weeks
to be covered for your whole
course?

Dear Martin
Aren't there some small-
minded people around?
The Gliding Club set up three
display-boards on Saturday for a
weeklong 'exhibition' on Level 2
in Sherfield. On Monday morn-
ing we came in to find:
a) the boards have been
moved downstairs to Level 1 (ho,
ho, very funny—yes even the
Gliding Club can take a prac-
tical joke).
b) two of the best photo-
graphs (poster-size) are missing,
presumably stolen.
Those photographs were
kindly lent to the club for the
exhibition by individuals—what
do we say to them now? A n d
what use are they? Gliding Club
members get their kick oui J»
flying, while presumably non-
members are not interested in
gliders or gliding (everyone is
welcome to have a go, if they are
interested). I understand there
are some very good poster shoos
around.
I trust those petty pilferers are
not members of College, but if
they are perhaps they could
return the photographs to where
they came from and we can
forget the whole matter
Yours sincerely

PS: What were the security
guards doing while all this was
going on?
Firearms
Sir
As a member of IC Rifle and
Pistol Club, I would like to make
it clear that the incident reported
last week, regarding the arrest of
several IC students on a firearms
charge, was in no way connected
with ICRPC. The three students
named are not members of the
club and will not be encouraged
to join, as their irrespor.:M
:Jc
actions can only be detrimental
to the club. We rely on good
relations with the Police for the
issue of Firearms Certificates,
etc and any such incident will
reflect badly on us.
Yours faithfully

Vandalism
Dear Sir
Last Saturday morning the
dialling mechanism was 'rem-
oved' from the switchboard of
the Sovereign Hotel. According
to witnesses, this was carried out
by the warden of the Fremantle
Hotel who is believed to hold a
similar sinecure in the Sovereign.
None of the Sovereign's res-
idents, i n c l u d i n g o u r sub-
warden, were consulted about
this. I was told, incidentally, that
the Fremantle's dialling mech-
anism was recently vandalised.
I s h o u l d p o i n t out that
although the dialling mechanism
was not in use at the Sovereign,
it is not wholly unlikely that
Sovereign residents will be
required to make good the loss
of tne mechanism from their
damage deposit. Furthermore,
lest it be uncommon knowledge
in some circles, I should mention
that removal or tampering with
telephone equipment by those
not authorised to do so const-
itutes a public offence. Under
the circumstances, I feel that
some explanation from M r .
Walker would not be amiss.

Rag a Drag?
Dear Sir
Speaking as the only couple to
attend the 'Rag and Drag' Disco
last Saturday actually in drag,
we are disgusted at the total
apathy of the students at this
College. Since 'Rag and Drag' is
the opening event of Rag Week,
it would have been reasonable to
expect more than 10 paying IC
students to attend.
It isa pity that we cannot
mirror the enthusiasm of Man-
chester University students,
(notably Rag Race Team no 18),
who, despite having hitched here
from Coventry earlier that day,
still managed to enter into the
spirit of the event by turning up
in drag.
If the remainder of Rag Week
is as poorly supported as this, it
is obvious that this College no
longer has any interest in Rag.
Perhaps we should abandon Rag
Week altogether?
Yours faithfully
