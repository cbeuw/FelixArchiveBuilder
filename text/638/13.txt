island of zombies, where questions are only
answered by 'BaP and 'Da', one of which
means yes, and one of which means no. Then
we take a trip into Transylvania, which is
peopled by humans and vampires, both of
which are split up into sane and insane, to find
out whether Dracula is alive. We then reach
the climax of the first section, as we visit
Dracula's castle where the Transylvanians
answer only with 'Bai' or 'Da'. Can you
construct a sentence which will find out if
Dracula is alive? What is the Unifying
Principle? All this, and much more, will
be answered in 'What Is The Name Of This
Book?'
Raymond Smullyan then takes us onto the
second section. He opens with dozens (far too
many in fact) of anecdotes more or less about
logic. I felt puzzled—what is the purpose of
these stories? Perhaps it was to introduce a bit
of light relief so that even if you didn't have the
stamina to attempt any of the questions, you
wouldn't look upon the book as a complete
waste of money. Or is it so that you will be
better fortified to face the rest of the book?
Whatever the reason, you need to be very
interested in logic to read most of the
remainder. From here on, as they say, the
going gets heavy.
After- showing how to prove anything,
Smullyan then shows why he believes
statements such as ' This statement is false'
are not logically admissable. His reasoning,
although well put, requires a clear mind to
understand, explain or anply. After clearing up
a few more paradoxes, he reaches the summit
of the book—a slightly simplified version of
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. This, in the
form he gives it, says that for a wide variety of
mathematical systems, under a certain
reasonable assumption about the system,
there must be a statement which is neither
provable nor disprovable in the system, no
matter how many axioms you assume.
In spite of the difficulty of this subject, the
author handles it very well and makes it
entertaining to read. Indeed, the first thing to
strike me about the book was its great
readability. I found myself reading the
problems without even trying them, simply to
find out whether Dracula was still alive and
why there is something instead of nothing! If
you are interested in logic, then I urge you
to buy this book. Me? I'm off to see if the
bookshop has any copies left just as soon as
I've saved up my £1.95!

Have you ever been to an event that you really
enjoyed and wanted to tell everyone about?
Well, now you can: just write a review, with a
picture if possible, and we'll do our best to put
it in the reviews pages. While the regular staff
handle a diversity of entertainments, we
obviously can't cover them all, and so whether
it's a yodelling spoon-player or a nifty night
spot then drop us a line. Do let me know
before you write it and try to make sure you
know when and where it's on and when it's on
till. Hand the article in to the FELIX Office on
Monday or Tuesday before it is to be
published.

Dear Sir
Hey man! Far out! You've
really got the joint sussed when it
comes to badminton, man! You
boys are just over the top. The
Guys must've had a really awful
trip, man! I mean, the hit your
star player, John (hello fans)
must have got when he saw 'fat
larry's band' in Kensington High
Street the other day, man! I
mean, no wonder he was playing
so well, man. But those guys
were just so boring weren't they,
man? It was like a really bad
scene, brother! I mean, all they
did, man, was just hit the shuttle
miles in the air, man. Martin fell
asleep twice in one point, and
that time he fell over, man, he
looked just like a beached whale.
I just cracked up, man! But, like,
man, I was really shocked when
the guys beat Guy and Pete in
one game man!
I grovel at your feet

is<>inely bad! One of
them anei wards apologised to
us for the standard of their play.
As well as this, we were on form.
Chris Mallaband, the official
holder of the 'worst haircut in
the Union' title, put two fore-
hand sliced drop:;::.,..- over the
net. The last time this happened
was 1972. Martin is on a fitness
craze at the moment, so his
returns of smashes with his> beer
belly were not up to his usual
standard. Pete 'I've got 77
members' G a d d and myself
(suffering from severe lacerations
and bite marks) won one set in
roughly three minutes and only
conceded 17 points in total.
Horrific sight of the week,

Yes folks, the Volleyball Club's
own-goal machine, also known
as 'pertuum immobile' is back
on the air after a lapse generated
by a recent total absence of
significant events involving the
game of our hearts. This is your
captain speaking. We will be
cruising at an altitude of 20cm,
barf bags are in the seat pocket
in front of you, and keep your
bloody hands off the net this
time Nada.
But now chaps (and chappes)
we need your support—seriously
(shorn mishtake, shurely?). On
Saturday Feb 26 (tomorrow) we
play at home to Bristol Poly
in the quarter final of the
E n g l i s h V o l l e y b a l l A s s o c .
National Students Cup. Bristol
were runners-up last year, and
since we have a pretty good
team, this is likely to be the best
game you'll ever see at Imperial.
How about giving yourself a
treat, an exciting spectacle
absolutely free! Even if you have
seen volleyball played before, it
may surprise you iat an
athletic gr- i. is. uuJ it's the
most popular game, at all levels,
in the w o r l d too. So give
Grandstand a miss, come to
the Volleyball Court at 2:00pm
t o m o r r o w . We really need
support badly ( G a d , this is
moving stuff!) it could mean the,
difference between j o y o u s
victory and communcal hara-
kiri! The court is on the second
floor of the old Chemistry
Building, behind Biochem. Enter
up the outdoor iron staircase.
Viva Imperial College, etc, etc.
Now for an up-to-date syn-
chronise watches folks! O n
Wednesday we played the Poly
of Central London, but as I am
writing this on Monday, God
only knows what the score
is/was. Our last two S E E T E C H
matches have had to be re-
scheduled because (a) G o l d -
smith's can't make Wednesday
afternoons and (b) Badminton
(what? who?) needed the hall
they day we had to play Middx
Poly but as the specimen that
edits this pearl is a big wheel is
badminton, I can't make too
much racket (geddit?!!) about
that, or he'll censor it painfully.
That about wraps it up for this
issue, hope you read this before
your chips get cold. The raving
writer having writ, moveth
on
