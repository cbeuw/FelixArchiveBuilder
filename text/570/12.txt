Twat of the Week
The prize this week must surely go to Mark
Clegg (President of Conservative Society) who
spoke out against a motion at Tuesday's U G M
calling for unilateral disarmament.
While disagreeing with the motion myself, I
thought that his amendment was too extreme.
His method of oratory was so ludicrous as to
g i v e u n i l a t e r a l d i s a r m a m e n t a c e r t a i n
credibility which O w e n Greene(proposer of
the motion) played o n well to his advantage.
Would the following romanticised type of
dialogue convince Y O U ?
"How would all you red-blooded males react
to a scantily-clad Aphrodite tripping through
the long grass . . . we must smash this Russian
Ripper!" After this, M r Clegg allowed "William
Cortazzi to speak against the motion which
was equally hilarious and earned a huge cheer
from the audience.
It's a b o u t time that M e s s r s C l e g g a n d
Cortazzi stopped trying to emulate men such
as Sir Winston Churchill - their audience is far
too intelligent to appreciate it.
Southside Security
It's nice to see that the bolts on the Southside
fire escapes have been r e m o v e d a n d the
proper locks installed.
However, the doors on gallery level are still
not being locked at night, allowing access to
anyone who climbs over the fire escape gates. I
know many people who have resorted to
climbing over the gates to see their friends in
Hall because they know there would be an
open door on gallery level. W e all know how
expensive and tricky to install automatic door
closers are, so surely the only course left open
to College is to imbed broken glass and barbed
wire at the top of the fire escape doors,
e x c a v a t e a moat a r o u n d S o u t h s i d e (plus
piranhas, of course) and erect a portcullis at
the m a i n e n t r a n c e . I l o o k f o r w a r d t o a
response to my suggestion.
Thanks to . . .
P a t r i c k , C o l i n , S t e v e , D a v e , M a r k , P h i l ,
Caroline, Shanne, Martin, Andy, Paul, and not
forgetting of course, Suzy Pek who didn't do
anything to help but wanted to see her name in
print. W h o a m I to object?
Next week's issue is the Christmas Bumper
Special — I guess that means about the same
as usual but with a bit of holly here and there.
Mind you, we will be having a superb Puzzle
Corner Extravaganza for you to do on the
train home. See you next week.

Puzzle Corner
Melanie (Black) By Scaramouche
Blanche (White)
"Bit one-sided, isn't it?"
Wodge had discovered his daughters deep
in thought over a game of chess, and was
making his usual unwanted observations. This
was the position, and it was White's move.
"Mate in two, it seems."
"Are you sure?" asked Melanie, suspiciously.
"Certainly," replied Wodge, "but I've no idea
how."
There was a long pause while this sank in.
The girls looked at each other, then at the
board, and then at their father.
"Do you seriously mean that if I play the
correct move, then whatever Melanie does I
will be able to checkmate her on my next
turn?" asked Blanche, incredulously.
"Right," answered Wodge, amused at her
bewilderment.
" A n d yet y o u don't know what that correct
move i s ? "
"Right a g a i n . "
"Impossible!" declared t h e girls together.
B u t Wodge's reasoning was as rigorous as
ever. C a n y o u demonstrate, from the given
position, that W h i t e h a s a m a t e i n two?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c,o
FELIX Office, b y Wednesday noon, please.
Last W e e k ' s Solution
B a c h a n d H a n d e l .
If the conductor tells t h e committee he has
adopted t w o suggestions, h e might have
chosen H a y d n a n d B a c h o r h e micht have
chosen just Bach. As the committee do not
know which, the game is not given away
completely.
Similarly if three suggestions are adopted,
the committee cannot distinguish just Mozart
from just Haydn.
Now if four suggestions are adopted, it
appears that Mozart, Haydn, Handel is the
only choice. But nowhere was it said that the
conductor is limited to the composers
mentioned, so Beethoven, Haydn, Handel is
equally valid.
So we are left to deduce that the conductor
refused to say that he had adopted only one
suggestion; and Bach, Handel is the only
possibility.
Was it excessively sneaky to make it look as
if I had set a problem without a unique solution
again? I don't think so. It fooled most of the
regular solvers, and the prize goes to David
Pashley, BE2, who was one of the two who got
it completely right.
This week's puzzle is rather hard, to get you
in training for the giant puzzle page in next
week's Christmas FELIX. So there is a prize of
£5 which will go to the first correct entry
opened on Wednesday noon, and if no entries
are absolutely correct, a reduced prize (down
to a minimum of £2) will go to the entry which,
in my opinion, is most nearly correct.
