Our beloved President celebrates the 10th anniversary of the
opening of his natural habitat at—the Union bar, Jan. '67.
THAT WAS
by Colin Hanson
It's over and we let it
roll
RCS Union meetings which became more sober, argumenta-
tive and inqiiorate than IC Union meetings. Nov. '66.
It is very tempting to make this
into an article which picks out all
the many faults in the methods
and people of the past year's
Union. Instead in this newspaper
let us look at what has been new
this year.
A situation which has been new
in its imminence if not in essence
centres on the Union fee increase.
With the Union's share of the Sport's
Centre pawned and investments
realised to an extent which arouses
considerable concern, this was a year
for economy wherever possible. At
the beginning of the Christmas vaca-
tion the propoied increase in the
Union fee was passed around the
Council table to give them courage
to approve estimates of Union expen-
diture which included np great measure
of economy. By Christmas it was be-
coming less certain that the fees in-
crease would be forthcoming and
nothing more had been heard of the
" loan" which had been discussed
with Sir Patrick Linstead—thank
goodness no one proposed that the
extra money be spent in advance.
Still the spending spree conrinues ; it
was discovered that Student Finance
had about £1,000 to*spare and instead
of deciding to save the money, a
scramble developed to see who could
get the most of it. At no time has
the need for ecdnomy been pushed
by Council, and although there is no
obvious waste of hundreds of pounds
there have been various stupidities
which have lost, altogether, a similar
sum. There was the unwanted Scru-
tiny which reached the proof stage
and was then allowed to die.
Even now there is no degree of cer-
tainty over the increased Union fee.
The Dept. of Education and Science
has been antagonistic to London
" students' luxury" and if it is not
increased this year it may be another
five years until it again becomes pos-
sible. Further, if the College is forced
to disclose its accounts, it may well be
reluctant to advance loans and var-
ious other fringe benefits.
LEST WE FORGET
New. to IC this year were Student
Houses ; the scheme for these grew,
from an idea hatched in the vicinity
of the Tizard sub-warden's flat, to
occupy hours of Council's valuable
time. Throughout last term new re-
ports (fashioned out of old ones) ap-
peared on the feasibility, desirability
and expense of these new mini-halls,
which occupied the Union chatter for
some time and even aroused a con-
troversy (albeit a mild one) over their
running. Pete Finch, who was already
in danger of being submerged by the
various odd-ends turned over to the
Welfare Officer, and Rex Lowin have
done some commendable work on this
possibility—let us hope that during
this academic term and the long (for-
getful) vacation the proposals are not
allowed to slip along the way on
which so many other projects have
disappeared.
