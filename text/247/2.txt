FELIX
Guildsmen obviously
not politically minded
The recent Guilds Hustings prior to the elections for next year's
C&G Excutive were poorly attended. All the posts with the excep-
tion of publicity officer, are being directly contested by at least two
candidates.
The sole heir to the publicity officer's position was also on view,
there being a possibility that candidates for other posts might stand
down for his, if defeated. The proposal speeches were all much like
one another—" I propose so and so because he has done this, that and
the other, and is a good Guildsman." To some members of the
audience this was not enough, and there was much cheering (and
booing) of Civil Engineering's candidates. Pete Casson and Phil
Marshall both delivered proposals for the post of president, their hopes
being respectively, Frank Morris and Chris O'Donnell.
Frank Morris is a second-year elec-
trical engineer. He has been his
year's representative on Guilds Union
Committee, organised this year's Car-
nival Football Pool and found time to
work on FELIX.
He says that his policies are based
on the greater involvement of the
Guildsmen—both Undergraduate and
Postgraduate, especially the latter
who a present show little interest in
the Union. After his year on Guilds
Committee he has formulated plans
for its streamlining so that less time
is wasted on trivialities.
Chris O'Donnell is also in his
second year, this time in the Mech.
Eng. Dept. He too has been a year
rep, and was Pubilicity Officer for the
Carnival Folk Concert besides being
on Selkirk Hall Committee.
He is worried by the average
Guildsman's lack of a sense of be-
longing to Guilds Union. He thinks
that a series of " Guilds Nights "—
similar in concept to the Mines
Nights at the Prospect—could bring a
feeling of identity with Guilds.
The proposal speeches on their
behalf were frequently drowned, by
uproar : Marshall's being unusual in
that it was (for "Marshall) serious.
The two vice-presidential candidates
were Dermot Corr and Dick James
and a good deal of questioning arose
over whether or not their proposers
were fingering the microphone.
As time went by the audience
dwindled, the speeches got shorter,
and by 2.30 when the hustings ended
Room 220 was less than half full—
no doubt due to exam fever.

Film Festival Flops
The Film Festival was the Flop of
Carnival week. Basing their estimates
on last year's audiences of 250 at the
evening showing, and 450 at the
midnight showing, the organisers took
elaborate precautions. Ten people
turned up to the first showing and
about seventy to the second. With
films not worth even the derision of
the audience, the evening fizzled out
in sleepy boredom.

ICSASAF
1CSASAF. the I.C. South African
Scholarship Appeal Fund, has begun
to grow and has reached an estimated
£65. Andy Jordan, in charge of the
fund, considers the amount so far
raised disappointing and hopes for a
rapid improvement. Applications to
industrial firms will be made but for
these to be productive a more size-
able proportion of the total must be
raised within I.C. Donations so far
have averaged around 10 shillings
each, though one envelope contained
" A tithe for a tenth of my mainten-
ance grant" which appeared to be
non-existent.
DramSoc
Revue
Success
The Dramatic Society's Carni-
val Revue was a great success.
The recipe was varied—an essen-
tia] in this sort of theatre—and
snappily presented.
The type of humour was fairly pre-
dictable but this did not make it any
the less funny. Sketches that stood
out particularly in my mind included
" A'1
" Crash "—where the pilot of the
aeroplane loses contact with all his
crew and his engines fail, begs
ground control to help, and is advised
as a last resort to " repeat after me :
Our Father, which art in Heaven . "
and " Cinderella," in which Lesley
Slater was a " mod" Cinderella,
complete with micro-skirt and Guilds
T-shirt. One of the funniest points
in this was, when asked by the fairy
Fully a thousand sweaty bodies,
packed the Union Concert Hall for
the Grand Finale Dance, to see the
Jimi Hendrix Experience. It was a
remarkable scene. Hendrix has pre-
viously been asked to change his
stage act and it was easy to see why.
During his performance at IC his
music tended towards the unusual
and erotic; his last guitar solo—in
" Wild Thing "—was particularly ex-
pressive. In fact it would be true to
say that the whole show was primarily
sex-oriented. This apart, it was
also forty-five minutes of very pro-
fessional music. The ten numbers
included a version of Dylan's " Rol-
ling Stone," a rocking version of
" Foxy Lady," and the Experience's
two hits.
Their drummer, Mitch Mitchell,
probably works harder tor nis money
than any other pop drummer. The
singing and guitar-work of Hendrix
with his now familiar dental solos,
proves he is a key talent. For a three-
piece group the Experience produce
a tremendous sound, and it was
suitably well received on Saturday.
godmother if her ugly sisters ill-
treated her, she said " Yes but I
quite en<oy it in a way !"
The second half of the evening was
even more enjoyable, possibly be-
cause of the excellent bar facilities
during the interval. The " Grip of
Iron" was a predictably amusing
Victorian melodrama—although one
did feel that devices such as banging
on the piano hard after each men-
tion of the villain's name are a little
overdone However, this sort of thing
is funny because the expected does
happen. The climbing sketch was
also very successful for the opposite
reason, and " Pete and John," the two
voyeurs were really excellent. (One
did think of " Dud and Pete " every
so often !)
