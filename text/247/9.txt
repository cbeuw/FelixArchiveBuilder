FELIX 9
£5 PAID
FOR A
CASTLE
This Castle, however, did not
have lour grey walls and a moat
but the Christian name Roy.
During Carnival week, some of
the more enterprising members of
Civil Eng, 1 captured Mr. Roy
Castle, the well-known comedian,
at the stage door of the Shaftes-
bury Theatre. They then per-
suaded him to come for a car
ride by using their vibrant Guilds
personalities.
His manager was approached for
a small donation to Carnival for
the return of his star. And in a short
while all concerned in the escapade,
including Mr. Castle, met up at St.
Giles Circus where Roy was hurried
out of the getaway car—by members
of his fan club ?
His manager, by now almost hys-
terical with delight at seeing his lost
property, asked for the key to the
handcuffs before parting with his
fiver. Unfortunately, the key seemed
to have been lost ! So the manager
paid up in a good humour and mirac-
ulously the key was found.
Roy attempted to unlock the hand-
cuffs anu succeeded in the ridicu-
lously short time of six minutes.
(Well, it is ridiculous, isn't it ?)
Castle in chains—looking unac-
countably happy. . . .
The kidnappers were men invited
into Mr. Castle's dressing room and
one hour after the handcuffing Roy
appeared in " Big Bad Mouse " at the
Shaftesbury.
What did the kidnappers and Mr.
Castle do before meeting his mana-
ger at St. Giles ? They all went to
a bar : where else ?
Ruhemann
romps in
At the joint meeting of the old and
the new committees, Peter Ruhemann
was elected Chairman of the S.C.C.
Although Ruhemann was unopposed,
the election took place as a proposal
speech was made by Chris Eriksson.
There was an interesting debate
about allegations of outside influence
in the Anglican Chaplaincy in connec-
tion with their insert in the Union
Blue Book. A motion was raised by
the Wells Society for permission to
hold " members only " meetings; after
discussion the motion was heavily
defeated.
The proposed Hellenic Society was
asked to. submit a constitution to the
next S.C.C. meeting.

What a
party!
The Tizard staircase party, of a
fortnight ago, which came under the
eagle eye of its Hall committtee, must
have become one of the most expen-
sive private parties at IC. Before the
fire alarm was set off, the party's cost
was about £40, for drinks. The total
has now been more than doubled, due
to a lavish series of fines. The four
hosts elected to pay £10 each rather
than spend a week out of hall, but this
was not the end of the financial
transactions. As a result of his
writing a letter to Dr. Cameron,
Tizard Warden, the man who first
pressed the alarm button, has now
been saddled with an even larger fine.
It all goes toward the Muscular Dys-
trophy fund.
PROTEST!
The fines were not paid without a
fight. Tony Duke and Rex Lowin were
asked to intervene, but despite a
heart-searching series of talks with
them the Hall committee stood un-
shaken on its decision. Three mem-
bers were recently given unofficial
cold baths. A flood of petitions is
being raised to register protest.
Council is being lobbied and money
is being collected to offset the £40.
But perhaps the Senior Warden, Dr.
Stevenson, had the final word—he
warned that if an appeal were made
he would investigate the party from
top to bottom. Understandably, no
appeal is being made.
