FELIX 3
The most haunted
house in England ?
C O L C U T T
" All (he stuff of sheer Vic-
forian melodrama is there, and
not a man, woman or dog for
miles around doubt these things."
So concluded a recent newspaper
article.
" We witnessed ostensibly
paranormal phenomena— never
before have I experienced any-
thing like this," testified a mem-
of the Society for Psychic Re-
search.
" . . . A maidservant rushed
out of the house screaming one
night at midnight and was never
seen again. . . . The body of a
dead woman was dragged by un-
seen hands across an oaken floor
. . . creaking stairs . . . bumps
and groans," reported an incred-
ulous journalist. " Is it the most
haunted house in England ?" he
asked.
Unfortunately the H. G. Wells So-
ciety "Ghost Group" that set out
over Easter failed to obtain positive
proof to back up these florrid
but unsubstantiated comments about
the happenings. Eleven members of
the group spent two nights in the Hall
surrounded by a vast array of elec-
tronic equipment.
Hannath Hall is a brick farmhouse
in the heart of the Fens near the vil-
lage of Tydd St. Mary. It is reputed
to be 400 years old but its associa-
tion with the supernatural only began
in 1870 when it was owned by a rich
landowner named Joseph Hannath.
He was very devoted to his wife and
when she died after forty years of
marriage he was so grief-stricken that
he refused to bury her. Only after
six weeks was the old man persuaded
to grant the mouldering corpse the
sanctuary of the earth. It is said
that no one has slept peacefully in
that bedroom since then. ~This
naturally became the target for the
Wells Soc. investigation.
Electronics
The plans for the expedition were
based on two assumptions :—
(1) The area was infested with prac-
tical jrk:rs and hoaxers.
(2) Members of the expedition
would endeavour to wreck ha-
voc by slipping off and creating
artificial phenomena.
Working on these premises, an
elaborate combination of human and
electronic vigil was devised so that at
no time in the night could anyone
enter the building without the team's
knowledge and that no member of the
team was ever left alone—a condition
to which the team readily agreed.
Within three hours of their arrival
at the house the team was ready for
action. Seven hyper-sensitive micro-
phones connected to four tape recor-
ders were placed at strategic points
around the house, and infra red
photography gave the audio and visual
records of events. Other equipment
used included trip wires to warn of
any entry into the building and a
complicated series of coloured light
signals devised to convey instructions
to other members of the team.
The first night saw no untoward
happenings. A persistent clanking
which caused initial alarm was finally
attributed to a loose pane in a green-
house window 50 yards away -this
was removed and the vigil continued.
However no further incidents were ,
reported.
The second day was devoted to dis-
cussions of the activities of the night
before and preparations for the
second and last night. Nick Clarke
meanwhile, besides taking numerous
photographs, had been measuring the
size ol bricks in the loft. This gave
rise to grave doubts about the an-
tiquity of the house.
Clatter !
The final night was more eventful.
By 8.30 all but three of the team had
disappeared to the local for fortifica-
tion against the elements ahead during
the long night. The three remaining in
the house, Moont, Haslinger and
Spence fell asleep in the warm control
room. But at 9.25 their sleep was in-
terrupted abruptly by an almighty
cla'ter over the loudspeaker. Nothing
more happened but later it was no-
ticed that the clock in the room—
that had been deliberately stopped
beforehand at 4.20—had been reset to
dead on 12 o'clock.
Thus the team returned home empty-
handed with no recording of " intelli-
gence-applied tapping." No poly-
thene bags full of " Genuine Ye Olde
England" ectoplasm, selling for 5s.
each, would dominate the Carnival
Fete !
However these negative results do
not provide sufficient ground to con-
clude that the supernatural is pure
fiction. This would be the same as
assuming that the population of
England was all-male on the basis of
of a census conducted in the Union
Bar
Endless
void . . . .
One investigator of psychic pheno-
mena puts it :
"Certain things happen which can-
not be explained. But they happen,
so how can they be explained?" We
in the "Ghosts Group" are trying to
answer that question and will con-
tinue to do so until we strike lucky.
But. come to think of it. the
chimneys were twisted and the moon
did project weird forms on the
darkened landscape and . yes
the trees did stretch their tortured
skeletal fingers into the black, endless
void . and the temperature certainly
was that of the tomb. In fact, it is
quite obvious that the poltergeist
simply had an innate fear of things
electronic.
WARREN MITCHELL
Folk Conce
The risk that this year's Carni-
val Committee took, in organis-
ing an event costing nearly as
much as last year's entire Carni-
val proceeds (give or take, a thou-
sand pounds) paid off hand-
somely, although not as hand-
somely as had been hoped.
The Folk Concert went off without
a hitch. Despite the uninviting pit
of empty, expensive seats separating
the 7/6's and the 10/ 's from the per-
forming artistes, the audience reacted
well, alihough it was slow to join vi
on sing-song choruses. Reducing the
price of the expensive seats might
cure this problem another year, with-
out reducing income.
Much of the success of the evening
was attributable to Warren Mitchell,
who had the actor's sense of exactly
when to hold the stage. No matter
whether he was being superbly comic
(His Hungarian Folk* Song went.
" ltsa longvar totip parare "). or mak-
ing a very sincere request for rhoney.
which should be tape-recorded and
used as an example, he held attention
the whole time, and formed the link
a show of this kind needs.
The first item was a performance
by Bob Davenport and the Rakes
who played some very lively folk-
songs, including some excellent fidd-
ling, and these were followed by
Anne Briggs and John Steele. Com-
pletely ditlerent in style, these two
complemented each other — Anne
Briggs with her wailing, expression-
less style, and John Steele with his
lightheaded humorous style of sing-
ing. The Young Tradition and the
Watersons were hardly worth a men-
tion, but Steve Grant, who opened the
second half, was excellent, and free.
He was received with such acclaim by
partisan and non-partisan alike that
he had to return and sing an encore
of " There once was a garden."
Finally, the Dubliners. who lived
up to their name as comics, singers
and above all. musicians. All their
numbers were entertaining, although
the last two Drunken Nights remained
disappointingly unsung. Perhaps their
best pieces were those two played on
guitar and mandolines.
The concert made a profit of £1,000
for Carnival Charity.
Elections come and elections go but
speculation goes on tor ever In a re-
cent S.A.M. poll a representative
sample of the refectory queue gave
the following answers to the question:
" How interested are you in the Com-
position of the Executive Committee
for next year?"
Interested 15%
Disinterested 15%
Which Executive
Committee? 20%
What is the Executive
Committee? 50%
Thus, allowing for the " don't
knows" etc.. and showing that you
can prove anything by statistics, 50
per cent of students are interested
in Union politics. I suppose therefore
some space should be devoted to a
few of the candidates for these top
posts. At the time of writing both
Mines and RCS have held their elec-
tions and neither has elected a poli-
tician as President. George Hulmc
defeated renowned bureaucrat Frank
Fuchs in a contest at which less than
one third of RCS bothered to vote.
Fortunately the RCS A.G.M. (also
less than one third of RCS presentl
was able to ratify the result before
thev were available.
PRESIDENT
This year so far we ve had no mo-
tions from the Union floor about the
Presidency and so it looks as though
once more he will be elected by joint
council. The two most likely candi-
dates are this year's Chairman of
'Debates. Chris Eriksson, and A.C.C.
Chairman Ray Phillips. Mr. Eriksson
is very efficient, backed by this year's
executive and therefore favourite, but
at the same time he is a bureaucrat
and tends to be rather humourless.
Ray Phillips is a bubbling extrovert,
with a mastery of repartee, and will
have to prove that he can act like a
responsible adult. It must be said
in his favour that he has a knack
of controlling committee meetings and
has run A.C.C. very well this yeai.
More interesting than the candidates
are their stable companions. Chris
Eriksson would almost certainly fa-
vour Mike Edwards as secretary.
When one considers that Council will
already have arch bureaucrat Peter
Ruhemann on it. it seems likely that
extremely long and entangled meet-
ings will ensue. On the other hand
Mr Edwards is also of the efficient
and humourles variety and will nicely
balance the more hearty elements of
the Exec. It is hard to say who will
get Mr Phillips backing but I think
that Rex Lowin. who is both amiable
and efficient, as shown by his part in
student housing, is the most likely
person. All in all. both pairs have
their good and bad points. If the
Union is to get any work done.
Messrs. Eriksson and Edwards will
have to swallow their books of stand-
ing orders and get used to having
their legs pulled. Or if the Union is
to be respected by the College the
other pair will have to show every-
body just how sensible they can be
when necessary.
Fuchs?
The last important post is that of
Deputy President which looks like
being contended for by Messrs. Lack
and Redmayne. Fortunately either
of these could do the job. In view of
his work this year as Publicity
Officer. I think Martin Lack is more
likely to be elected.
By the way, I don't think we've seen
the last of Mr. Fuchs: he could still
stand for floor-representative and even
President. He may be a bureaucrat
but he is one of the most enthusiastic
people in the Union. He is always
willing to listen to and consider other
people's points of view and although
the " hearties" don't like him his
presence on Council is often an asset.
