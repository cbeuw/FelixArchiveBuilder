Stockbridge suggests:

Now lhal tin's year's Carnival effort
is all over bar the shouting, one or
two factors in Carnival Charity col-
lecting became obvious.
The basic premise in the future
should be that the money is in the
public's hands, THAT'S WHERE TO
GET IT. Students haven't got much
money and won't part with it anyway,
'this leads to the conclusion that
MOST of the money must come from
"tin-shaking" in the first term of
the year. This must build up over the
years to produce immense amounts of
money in the future. I can see no
reason why next year's Carnival
should not raise £10,000, as the avail-
able sources have barely been tapped.
The extension of the participation
of year reps, and Vice-Presidenis is
a must for the continued success of
Carnival in future. Less effort must
be expended on time-wasting, low-
profit ventures such as the film-shows.
As for more concrete suggestions, I
would suggest dropping the Summer
Carnival week and having a Rave
International evening and Revue in
the second term of the year, when
people have not yet succumbed to the
horrendous spectre of the examiner
leering over the general mist of prob-
lem sheets and course work.
Acting on the experience gained at
the Albert Hall this year, Carnival
should hold at least one Giant Con-
cert each year and a collecting rag
week at the end of the Christmas
term.
This year's football pool showed a.
profit of over £50 and this has been
a very good effort for the first year
it has been attempted. It should,
next year, be enlarged to run from
Freshers' Day throughout the season.
M,ire effort should also be made to
se'; to members of staff.
[his year the raffle made an in-
creased profit relative to last year's,
but this could be improved further
by reducing 'the main raffle prize;
a £250 colour television set, for exam-
ple, should suffice. The summer term
should be spent planning an enormous
fete and a final dance similar to this
year's should be held.
More begging letters should bring
in more money.
The hot-dog stand was very popular
during Carnival week and next year, 1
think, it would be a good idea to sell
hot-dogs throughout the year
It will be several years before the
Carnival realises its full potentialities
but 1 hope we have succeeded in put-
ting it on the right lines.
