FELIX 7
THE YEAR THAT WAS
Following the disorganised, ill-
Supported Carnival last year with its
dismaying yield of £800, this year has
had a new commercial money-making
outlook. Instead of a doubtful ten
days' activity in the summer term in
which to collect the public's money, it
has changed to a year-round organisa-
tion with which many members have
identified themselves, jerry's energy
and his imaginative team have pro-
duced what is rumoured to be a
date by the " sportsman." At the
beginning of this academic year Tony
called for a strong Union but for a
long time he took a lenient hold on
its activities—leniency which he tried
to end at the chaotic Union meeting
last term. Certainly he has consis-
tently failed to take a firm stand
against the excesses of his " sport-
ing " colleagues, it would be easy
to go on and catalogue the failings of
this powerful character- a position
PHOENIX failed to get up to date
record year—the courage to risk a
large amount in booking the Albert
Hall paid, and will, I hope, become a
regular feature of the Union's activi-
ties. As the year progressed, the Car-
nival organisation became larger and
more diffuse with Jerry becoming less
aware of the fringe activities. This
is perhaps an excuse for the puerile
publication, Bog, and those pointless
and destructive evenings of fly-post-
ing.
Politicians
& Sportsman
Elsewhere in this issue, I am told,
Messrs. Duke and Fuchs are giving
their views on the Presidency. These
two represent the two major pressure
groups in IC : the " Sportsmen " and
the " politicians." I am puzzled to
know whether the existence of these
active groups (for no one could ac-
cuse them of apathy) has a good or
bad effect on the Union. Their
activity in the past has let to covert
conflicts, e.g., to prevent the unpopu-
lar " politician " Keith Guy from be-
ing elected President. Tony Duke
was apparently put up as a candi-
like the Presidency is too exposed and
hides no weaknesses. One- of the
main obstructions in the way of an
effective criticism of him is, as any of
his acquaintances knows, that he is
" such a good bloke"—an elitist
whose friendliness could have been
better applied to strong management
of the Union.
With the exception of the new pro-
jects listed above, I would describe
this as a year in which the Union
has been " allowed to run itself."
There has been too little direction ;
too often the attitude of people in
positions of responsibility has been
that problems are never too pressing
and can always be postponed until
next year. The would-be managers
of next year's Union should realise
that theirs should be a heavy respon-
sibility, particularly at the very top.
It is not enough to take a year of
power and leave the Union running
even more erratically to a halt.

IC up the Orinoco
This summer I.C. will be sending out three expeditions—to East
Greenland. Ethiopia and the River Orinoco. The College is one of
the very few who send, let alone finance, expeditions. The first one
was in 1957, and the target was Everest. For this trip, a grant of
£5,000 was raised by the College and Union. In the following ten
years, 34 expeditions were organised., in which 218 men and 12
women have taken part.
Of the first Exploration Board
Grant of £5.000 much was spent on
equipment, which was used by subse-
quent expeditions. The average grant
is now £1.300—-of which £1.000 comes
from the College Governors, and £300
from the Union. The personal contri-
bution, expected from each member
at the party, now stands at £60.
There are now three or four expe-
ditions a year, costing about £L200
each. This is derived, in equal pro-
portions, from three sources — the
Board, the Explorers and External
firms and foundations.
Each year 1 C. provides near to 10
per cent of the University expendi-
ture from this country. Its safety
record is good—no lives have been
lost, although many bones have been
broken."
