The spoils of the U.L. Regatta
THE BOAT CLUB had a successful day at the University
Summer Regatta. All the College Crews found little opposition in
their journey to each of the eight finals/. The Junior VIII won the
first finale comfortably, and after further exciting races, the Allum
Cup came to LC. This was achieved by a worthy win over U.C.
by 14 lengths—U.C. were the expected winners. In all 25 individual
trophies were gained by members.

Record
Breaking
Week
Over the last fortnight two
College records and one Univer-
sity of London record were
broken by athletes from IC.
On Wednesday. 10th May. Derek
Wade, competing for U.L. against
Cambridge University and Lough-
borough College, cleared 23 ft. 2} ins.
in the long jump to shatter the old
record of 22 ft. 3y ins. He had pre-
viously bettered this latter distance in
competition for his club, but club per-
formances are not recognised as Col-
lege records.
The other records were achieved in
the match between U.L. and AAA on
Wednesday 17th. In the 440 yards,
Richard Beck ran a very good race to
come in second, behind Olympic
finalist Tim Graham, in the time of
48.9 sees. (Graham did 47.6)—improv-
ing the record by a fifth of a second.
He is now only 0.4 sees, below the
U.L. record set up in 1951 by Olym-
pic and Empire medallist Arthur
Wint. In the mile Nick Barton fin-
ished third behind former All-Eng-
land Schools champion. Chris Stewart,
and guest. Bruce Tulloh. Barton cut
1.4 sees, off his own U.L. record to
set up a new time of 4 mins. 9.5 sees.
This was, however 1.3 sees, outside
the College record.
FIREFLIES ON THE WELSH HARP. One of the races during
the College sailing club annual Regatta, held at the Welsh Harp.
Sailing Club
finish with
Regatta and
Dinner
AFTER THE VERY successful
Easter cruises, the season was ended
with the Annual Regatta and Dinner.
The Regatta was held at tbe Welsb
Harp, on Wednesday, May 10th. Sail-
ing conditions were perfect and tbe
racing was both keen and close; this
was aided by an excellent turn-out.
Geoff Parker won the Novice's tro-
phy, Jim Brown the Double handed,
and Nigel Souster the Single handed.
As an experiment, the Dinner was
held at the Burford Bridge Hotel, near
Box Hill, a week after the Regatta.
Everyone had an hilarious evening,
thanks to a private bar and no
worries about driving. During the
dinner the prizes for the Regatta were
presented by Helen, the Commodore's
" bird," and speeches, of diverse
quality, were made.
On Wednesday, the 24th May, a
grand post-mortem, on the cruising,
is to be held (complete wi!h a never
before shown movie), in the MINING
lecture theatre. It is hoped that all
will attend, and the meeting begins at
1830 B.ST
