GFQQ! Remember, the quiz ends in March at the end of the Spring
Term, so keep sharp and send in your entries if you want to win the
super Grand Prize! The end-of-term prize ('Bad Motherfucker' wal-

To start the year we have a special Bond G F Q Q featuring famous
quips from both 007 himself and various villains/henchmen from
Bond films from across the years. I'm surprised we haven't touched
upon this subject before... where else can you find names like Holly
Goodhead, Fatima Blush, Plenty O'Toole and, of course, Pussy
Galore? Well, same rules as always (Film, Character/Actor) - good
luck, see you next week! Bobby Cyclops
