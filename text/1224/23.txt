Hey there good buddies. Fudge and Cyclops are back in business, bring-
ing you the latest in puzzledom and all-purpose lubricants for another
term of fun-filled madness. Our apologies for not making an appearance
last week but we were late in returning from our break in Thailand,
which was spent filming our upcoming masterpiece: "Bangkok Chick
Boys II - Cyclops sheds a tear." The winner of last week's collaboration
crossword is Michael Bye, Physics II. I don't know who those two idiots
were who served up that disgusting vomit in the guise of a x-word, but
rest assured they'll never be allowed to do it again. Until next time, be
excellent to each other. Dr. Hot Fudge
