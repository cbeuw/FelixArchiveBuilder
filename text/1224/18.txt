Join us for an informal presentation at our European Headquarters,
One Cabot Square, Canary Wharf at 6pm on 4 February. Meet ex interns,
junior and senior professionals and find out more about the opportunities we
can offer for Summer 2002. Places will be allocated on a first come first
served basis, so to attend please email hayley.pinnell@csfb.com
It might be a summer internship. It might last just eight to twelve weeks. But, for those prepared to work hard,
ask questions and show initiative, it's also a real job with real responsibility. We'll expect you to ask questions
when you join us. So why not get into the swing of it by asking a few at our presentation. Find out about an
investment bank that's on its way to becoming the world's number one. Discover whether there's a role that's
right for you in our Investment Banking, Fixed Income or Equity divisions. For more information and to apply,
