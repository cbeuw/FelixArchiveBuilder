Bag Bombs
Many U.S. experts fear a new
round of domestic flight delays
will begin today, as thousands
of business commuters and hol-
idaymakers flock back to the
planes.
This Friday was named by
Congress - w i t h President
Bush's support - as the date by
which all airlines and airport
security checkpoints must meet
new, tougher, standards for pre-
flight screening.
The new measures are aimed
at thwarting and restricting the
activities of terrorists; a major
priority for the American people
and their current (Republican)
administration.
They include mandatory bag
X-rays, sniffer dogs to search
plane cabins and holds just
prior to take-off and harsh
penalties for carrying suspect-
ed terrorist items.
However, many senior airline
executives have criticised the
schedule as "unworkable,"
grumbling that the laws,
passed just before Congress
recessed for Christmas, are "too
rushed to fully implement."
Security teams, they say, are
still understaffed. To check all
travelers could cause long
delays. Not to do so could be
fatal.

A scuffle between Russian
and American diplomats - over
civil liberties, to boot - shows
that while the Cold War is
over, the two former enemies
are still capable of behaving
pretty icily when they feel like
it.
The dispute, which started
with two junior delegates from
the U.S. Consulate in
Vladivostock, rapidly spun out
of all proportion this week, as
the right-wing administrations
of the two countries each
sought to blame the other.
A demonstration in
Vladivostock to free an impris-
oned Russian journalist, one
Grigory Pasko, set the stage.
He was convicted last year of
high treason for telling
Japanese media about naval
nuclear waste dumped at sea.
Eyebrows were raised in
Moscow, however, when it
was learned the two
Americans had attended the
demonstration - an "unwise
decision", according to one
uncredited Kremlin source.
The U.S. State Department
insisted their behaviour was
not unusual, and "perfectly
normal diplomatic practice."
Presidents Bush and Putin
are both said to be concerned.
