FIE Party
No idea what this is. No-
one tells me anything.
You're probably not
allowed to just turn up,
but if this means some-
thing to you, it's on now.
dBs, 5:00pm
Trivia
The capital of
Azerbaijahn? Who
knows? These people
do. How clever do they
need to be? Very, appar-
ently. More than me.

Sound Band Night
Experimental bands
experiment with experi-
mental instruments,
while possibly experi-
menting with experi-
mental drugs.
dBs, 6:00pm
Supersonic
Don't know. Again, I'm
meant to be doing pub-
licity, but since I'm not in
the main office, I never
find out anything. Indie,
I hear. So Pulp then.

The country all weekend
Amelie
Ah, ooh, oh, how sweet,
eee! yay! wow... gasp.
Very sweet film for girls,
I think. Or maybe boys
who are 'in touch with
their feminie side'. Take
your girlfriend, perhaps?
Spy Games
Brad Pitt. I'd have 'im, if
I were inclined, but I
suspect this is a weak
attempt at getting girls
to go to this obviously
boy-ish film. Take your
girlfriend?
Bandits
Billy Bob Thornton, who,
with a name like that,
must, allegedly, be
inbred, and Bruce Willis,
who, with a name like
that, must, allegedly, be
Australian. Girlfriends?
The Others
Rah rah rah. Pretty scary
stuff, where they are all
ghosts who think they
are alive. Maybe. I see
dead people? Probably
not, but you could take
your girlfriend.
Best In Show
Pret a Porter with dogs,
perhaps, so still got the
supermodels. Not that
I'm bitter or anything. I
could still have them,
you know. A n d your girl-
friend, so there.
