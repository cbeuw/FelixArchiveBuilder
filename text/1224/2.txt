Union Shake-Up?
All the discussion over the past
few months on the subject of
the new Union structure came
to a head last Tuesday.
There had been hopes that
the shakedown of the structure
would clear away some dead
wood from the system, but it
seems that the force of conser-
vatism has won, with very few
changes being made that will
affect the average student.
To understand the changes
made requires a strong under-
standing of Union policy, how-
ever the reasons for the change
are much easier to explain.
Since the rector, Sir Richard
Sykes, announced the n e w
move to a faculty system that
College is undertaking at the
moment, it has been obvious
that the Union must change in
some way so as to reflect this,
in order to have any chance of
representing the students with-
in the various departments. The
past few months have seen
many theories put forward, but
the final options were laid out
by Union President Sen Ganesh
on Tuesday, during a five hour
Council meeting that w a s
almost entirely on this subject.
Since these changes will
modify the Union constitution, a
two thirds majority is required
over two separate sessions to
affect the changes, and each
session is meant to have a 'quo-
rate' number of Union officers
present. The majority was easi-
ly reached, with David Francis
(Deputy President of Education
and Welfare), the only person
who voted against the n e w
changes being made. However,
while there were more than the
quorate amount of votes cast,
this was due to many votes
being proxied from non-present
members, a n d therefore if
someone had cared to say 'quo-
rum', the meeting would have
to have been declared invalid.
This practice, however, is usual-
ly considered a waste of time,
due to the low turnout that
Council generally has. It is
interesting, therefore, to note
that the new changes will add
around an extra 40 members to
Council, most of whom will be
Departmental representatives.
However, since the Union is a
part of College, all changes will
have to go through the
College's own governing bod-
ies, and it has been noted that
many of the members of these
bodies will not like the idea of
an eighty strong Union Council,
seeing as the College Council
only has 20 members. If the
changes that are being made
by this 'sovereign' student
body, therefore, are not liked by
College, they can return the
suggested amendments to the
Union, stating any of their own
changes that they feel should
be considered. While they can
not actually state what should
be in the Union Constitution,
they can make very strong sug-
gestions, and in the mean time
make life quite uncomfortable
for the Union, both financially
and politically. While this
reporter is certainly not sug-
gesting that these tactics
would be undertaken, it is
notable that if this were to
occur then any external
observers may see this as an
infringement of student rights,
and public knowledge of any-
thing along these lines occur-
ring could be heavily detrimen-
tal to both the image of
Imperial College as a whole, as
well as the view of the Union
that other political student
bodies may have. However, if
College feels the changes the
Union wants to make are fool-
ish, they will have no choice
but to step in, so it is a narrow
path that must be trodden.
On a less global level, how-

ever, the important changes
that have passed this first draft
of a new Constitution are main-
ly in name. No longer are there
Constituent College Unions
(CCUs), but are now Faculty
Student Associations (FSAs),
but these seem to have been
mapped from the old to the
new. In addition, there are now
three Dep Reps (Departmental
Representatives) for each
department, one for
Undergraduates, one for
taught post-graduates, a n d
one for Research students.
Each of these will have a space
on Council, giving much more
power to all FSAs (with about
20 extra members each), apart
from the Medics, who have
gained less than 5 members.
Obviously there are more
changes, but this reporter only
just understands these ones
(and has probably made sever-
al errors), and this is only the
first draft of a long process.
