What can w e say... too much
drinking at School Disco & too
much dacning - sore feet... well
if we can't play netball, we
have to say w e can play better
drinking games!
We started with scores draw-
ing all the way, until they start-
ed getting more, that is. Ruthy-
baby w a s superb & quick
around the court, and then
Claire kept that ball from going
out of the centre third. But even
Claire (our medic who plays for
the right team!!) couldn't
always stop the 6+ ft (we're
sure there should be a height
limit in netball - if you can reach
the ring without jumping you
shouldn't be allowed to play...
rainbow coloured socks are
always going to put people off.
too) shooter from getting the
ball. Kathryn kept the Goal
Attack (GA) completely out of
the shooting by blocking her
out of the 'D'. Beckie (out most
valuable player of the match)
scored many amazing goals
from all sorts of positions, and
Hannah, with her dancing
spins, got free of her Goal
Defence (GD) at every turn, fin-
ishing off with some beautiful
goals. Jess fought against
Hannah - a medic who had
decided to do trials with us, but
now plays for the medics... trai-
tor! Just a few grunts and gri-
maces for the first match,
though in the 3rd and 4th quar-
ters, the medics extended their
lead, despite all our efforts. We
played a good match, but
couldn't quite pull it off.
Jess
Nobody would have ever
believed it. Five-nil to the
ladies' seconds! It was more
than w e could ever dream of.
The match started with a
smooth move from Bex taking
the ball into their half, which
was where it stayed for the
Ladies
remainder of the game. Less
than five minutes in, our
supreme captain Nikki scored -
we were all astonished. A cou-
ple of minutes later the two
Jens combined light forces
resulting in Jenny D placing a
nifty one past their keeper.
Hockey
After some excellent defending
of the centre line by Anita and
Sally, Chloe grabbed the ball
and took he score to 3-0. Half
time came and passed, and our
magnificence w a s not sur-
pressed. One more each from
Nikki and Jenny, some fantastic
runs from Marianne, excellent
tackles from Mary Hafia, and
marvellous defending from
Karen H and the score stood 5-0
as the final whistle blew. A n d
where would w e have been
without the somewhat bored,
belly-shuffling Karen M in goal?
RSM Football
A cold January wind blew
over the desolate, waterlogged
pitch. Stobbs wandered aim-
lessly from the changing rooms
and by the time he reached the
pitch, the mighty RSM were 1-0
down, after only thirty sec-
onds. However, it was clear to
everyone that this early surge
was just a flash in the pan.
The pitch glowed, the crowd
silenced and SOAS quivered in
their feeble boots as the mighty
ex-skipper graced the field
with his presence. That was
the best it was ever going to
get for SOAS, and by the looks
on their faces, they knew it.
Rob Thomas (the defensive
prodigy) inspired the dynamic
movement of n e w left back,
bionic Gaz Northam as he
stormed up the pitch with the
debutant extraordinare Ludo
by his side.
Sweet interplay w a s the
theme in the presence of the
legend, Sir Andy Mason who
co-ordinated the rising stars' E l
Capitane Schluch-es-Menzies.
Lord Peter took the ball from
what seemed an uncompromis-
ing position. He played what
seemed an impossible ball
through to the deviant yet
explicitly talented James
Stewert who split the defence
like a grade 1 clipper through a
taliban's beard.
Dear Lord, Pete was great,
Ludo rolled a six, Bertie got
shirty and new keeper Johnnie
played the strikers like a cheap
German harmonica. Thanks to
Ken who scored four goals.
Final score: RSU 4-1 SOAS.
