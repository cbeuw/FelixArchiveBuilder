GKT I 5 - 29 IC I
Having trekked across London to
play the mighty GKT, only to find
they had made the slight oversight
of forgetting a referee, we had
doubts we would ever actually play
a rugby match this season.
However, with the calm interven-
tion of Brimah, our backs coach,
the game went ahead.
The game got to a "cracking"
start with an immense scrum being
led by Chris "You're not so lippy
with your legs in the air"
Protherough, and soon enough,
after some slick forwards moves,
the backs were released by an out-
standing kick by scrum half Rob to
score their first try.
Then GKT came back, worrying-
ly led by the ginger army to push IC
back to their own try line. The
Imperial Defence, led by Alex
"shiner" James rose to the chal-
lenge admirably and the half ended
with a blistering try by Dan "Mr
Casual" Darg to put the score at
12-0 to IC.
IC began dominating the second
half with monstrous tackles going
in from Mike "the Animal" Hicks
and Alex James to put GKT on the
back foot. Further outstanding play
from Chris "Are you clean or do I
need to go to the clinic"
Protherough again gave the backs
the space and opportunity they
needed to break through the
defence and set up Will "the
Raging Bull" Nicklin with a try in
the corner. To state that Will enjoys
picking on little wingers is as big an
understatement as saying our sup-
porter's hair was a little queer.
Basically, Imperial rose to a
huge challenge despite the obvious
cheating on the scoreboard by the
furry ginger. Special mentions to
Dave Evans, whom scored a fresh-
ers hatrick, Dan Darg and the
indisputable man of the match
Chris Protherough. Watch out
Virgins before it goes to his head.
Some of us are too impatient to
wait for snow to start racing, and
so the first race of the year took
place last Saturday at Wycombe
Summit.
The first two races for both
teams proved that racing with no
practice for 5 months is not a
good idea, with both teams com-
ing away empty handed.
An intermission in the racing
gave both teams a chance to
regroup. Ben and Ned headed
straight for the bar at this point -
something about dutch courage
and fear of pain - whilst the rest
of us hit the slopes to try and pre-
vent more embarrassment.
Both methods seemed to work,
however, and IC1 and IC2 both
racked up 2 deserved wins.
Confidence was high and IC2
stepped up to take a tough chal-
lenge against Southampton. All 5
racers went down and IC2 cele-
brated a deserved victory - until
they were disqualified.
DID V O U KNOUU ?
-
No matter, IC1 v IC2 was up
next, and more importantly Ned
against Hideaki - last years race
captain against the all conquering
Japanese newcomer. Hideaki
matched Ned all of the way, and
it would have been a photo finish
but Hideaki fell at the last and
crossed the line on his arse. The
rest of the race was a formality,
the lsts recording a victory that
was so easy that the last racer
crossed the line backwards.
IC clearly won the final race,
but it was given the other way.
Time for Ned to have a tantrum -
a pre-requisite of any race meet-
ing - but throwing the toys out of
the pram had no effect and the
teams finished 12th and 15th.
Special mentions must go to
Katie, who flew the flag for the
imperial ladies in the absence of
the rest of her team, and to
James who came out of retire-
ment to help with our lack of
team members.
