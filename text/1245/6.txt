A wandering we shall go
South of Snowdonia, only one
mountain range approaches
915m in Britain: the Brecon
Beacons. The Brecon Beacons
National Park consists of the
Black Mountains to the East, the
Beacons in the centre and, con-
fusingly, the Black Mountain in
the West. On Friday night, 11 of
us met up at the union with this
national park as our destination.
Despite the inadequacies of the
union bus, we set off in good
time for the hills. The traffic was
heavy and Wales felt very far
away, even further due to the
lack of radio in the bus, but we
kept spirits high, and were soon
at the chippy in Caerleon. A small
hop further and we arrived at our
luxury accommodation in Brecon.
We said hello to the other resi-
dents in the bunkhouse and a few
bevvies ensued, after which we
were all pretty tired and retired to
our beds.
We were all woken by a beau-
tiful sunrise in the morning, apart
from some of the girls who were
woken by Chris in his boxers mis-
taking their room for his.
Apparently this was not such a
beautiful sight! Our walk started
from Llantony in the Black
Mountains. This is a picturesque
village with a very impressive
ruined priory - the stuff of picture
postcards. We climbed up a
steep path to the top of the ridge
and on to the famous Offa's Dyke
path - built to keep the
Welshmen out of England. The
views into England were lovely,
and as we walked along in the
sunshine it really couldn't have
been more pleasant. Before too
long we arrived at the first trig
esting, giving us nice views over
the vale and surrounding hills.
The pub beckoned and we
dropped back into the valley for a
pint, and a chat with the less
than sober locals. The country
roads on the drive back to the
barn proved to be too much of a
challenge for the bus, resulting in
it getting stuck in the mud. With
a bit of brute strength, the men
point - Hay Bluff - just in time for
dinner. Revived and full of energy,
we climbed up to the next trig
point after lunch. This one was
the highest point of the day, and
was named 'The Lord of
Hereford's Knob'. I kid you not.
The ridge on the way back was
sharper and therefore more inter-
managed to push us out and
thankfully we could carry on
home. Thanks guys! On our
return to the barn we all ate too
much curry and Rich and Chris
had a chilli eating competition. It
really is amusing to see grown
men cry!
Waking on the Sunday we
could hear the rain bashing on
the window. High winds were
forecasted - not a day to go up on
the tops then. Instead we drove
to Pontneddfechan and walked
along the valley to the potholes at
Ystradfelte, which made a perfect
lunch stop. The walk back in the
afternoon included the main
attraction of the day, where the
path passes behind a waterfall.
Seeing as we were all already
soaked from the rain, no one
minded getting wetter and it took
sometime before the novelty of
this waterfall wore off.
Unfortunately, all good things
come to an end, and it was time
to head back. The lack of radio
on the way back got too much
and everyone decided to make
their own entertainment by
singing a variety of classic songs
from the Beatles and Queen. It
didn't sound good, and the driv-
ers contemplated the various dif-
ferent methods of suicide. We
stopped off at the Crown and
Horns for dinner, where we, by
pure fluke, bumped into ex-presi-
dent Sam, before we headed for
home and our much-needed
beds.

And Alex Said...
Being a student is all about coping
with a small budget, and if you're
especially thrifty, you can usually
stretch out a year's student loan to
cover your expenses in London for
about three weeks.
As a very old man once mum-
bled to me when I asked him for
financial advice, "look after the
penis, and the pandas will look
after themselves". I don't know
what he meant either, and it cost
me my job at the local zoo, but
perhaps he was telling me it was a
good idea to save money wherever
I can (and not, as I thought, to
expose myself in the penguin
enclosure).
So, how to stem the flow of cash
from your wallet into the outside
world? First, get your food expen-
diture down to a minimum.
Vegetables are cheap. I bought an
onion the other day. I got home
and looked at the receipt, and it
cost 8p. Now, on its own, that
wasn't a very nice meal at all, and
I probably should
have bought some
indigestion tablets to
go with it, but at
least it hardly cost
me anything.
Second, scrimp on
rent by living in a rat-
infested cesspool. Being London,
this means you could have had a
fifty-bedroom palace in Leeds for
the same amount, but try not to
worry. You can blow all that hard-
saved cash by drowning the sor-
rows of your miserable existence
down the pub. Excellent.
Of course, poverty breeds crime,
which is probably why I was
plagued by theft when I was in
halls. I was particularly distressed
by the loss of four Cornish Pasties.
When I noticed my milk was going
missing, I devised a
cunning plan.
No doubt several
of you are also expe-
riencing milk loss, so
do what I did: wait
until you've only got
a few centimetres of
milk left and dilute it with water
until you've got half a bottle full.
This way you don't end up wasting
much real milk, and it looks pretty
much the same. Next, take your
lkg tub of table salt and pour as
much in as you can be bothered
to. Shake it up, and voila. If you've
put enough salt in, even a splash
in some tea will be heartily dis-
gusting. The only thing left to do is
tempt your milk thief, and there is
nothing more tempting to some-
body who is looking to steal some
milk than a big sign attached to
some milk, saying "PLEASE DO
NOT STEAL MY MILK". So, try
that. No need to wait around - you
should be able to hear the retching
from your bedroom.
Of course it's not just students
who face financial hardship - the
recent announcement of the plan
for top-up fees shows Imperial is
on a diet of Tesco Value Beans too.
The rector thinks the answer is
charging students more, but here's
a crazy idea - why doesn't College
spend less? If it means cutting out
a few lectures, so be it. It's a sac-
rifice I'm willing to make. Alex
Cash!
