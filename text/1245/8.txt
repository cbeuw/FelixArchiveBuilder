Gourami... a holiday it's not!
Gourami, a fictional island in the East Indian Ocean, is the setting for Shell's interactive business
challenge. As part of an international project team you will be tasked with developing and present-
ing a 5-year business strategy to senior Shell leaders. The issues are complex and the deadlines
demanding. You'll learn a lot, and you'll learn fast.
Welcome to Gourami.
This is your chance to discover first hand what the energy business is all about and to see how you
would cope at the sharp end of an international organisation. It's no holiday, but it could be the
break of a lifetime.
