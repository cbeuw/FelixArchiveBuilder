In 1961, two Portuguese stu-
dents were sentenced to prison
for seven years. Not a month, not
a year but seven years. And the
reason? For raising their glasses
in a toast to freedom. In 1961, a
British lawyer, Peter Benenson,
read about these students and on
the 28th of May he wrote an arti-
cle for the Observer newspaper
entitled 'The Forgotten Prisoners'
which was an appeal for amnesty
for men and women held in jail
for their political or religious
views. The appeal was also print-
ed in other papers across the
world, and Amnesty International
was bom.
What is Amnesty about?
Amnesty International has
grown into the largest voluntary
human rights organisation in the
world with an organised presence
in 72 countries. Today, Al has
more than a million members
worldwide and students play a
crucial role in its organisation. In
fact it relies a lot on the commit-
ment, motivation and energy of
students to achieve success in the
coming years.
Often people take part by writ-
ing letters to governments in cases
where people have been wrongful-
ly detained. Sometimes there is a
good end result and sometimes
unfortunately it doesn't turn out
the way we hope. But people
don't give up because for every
letter written, every bit of aware-
ness raised, Al members provide
hope for victims of human rights
abuses around the world. One
recent example was General
Gallardo. On 7 February 2002,
General Gallardo, a prisoner of
conscience detained for over eight

years, was released after
President Fox ordered that his sen-
tence be reduced to time served.
He was detained in 1993 after
criticising human rights violations
by the Mexican armed forces and
for proposing the creation of a mil-
itary human rights ombudsman to
investigate such abuses.
In 1994 Amnesty International
adopted General Gallardo as a
prisoner of conscience. Amnesty
members have campaigned for
his release over many years and it
is this on going pressure on the
authorities that has contributed to
secure his release. General
Gallardo's family have expressed
their gratitude for all our help:
"We are all very happy that our
father has been released and we
are profoundly grateful to
Amnesty International. Without
your support my father's release
would not have been possible."
We have an Amnesty
International group at Imperial
where we meet up every
Thursday to write letters for par-
ticular cases like General
Gallardo. We have stands around
college, and arrange speakers to
visit. We also work with other
London university groups as well
as more 'active' awareness raising
such as demonstrations outside
parliament. This term Amnesty
International are focusing on the
poor regulation of the arms trade,
which is fuelling violent conflict
and human rights abuses.
