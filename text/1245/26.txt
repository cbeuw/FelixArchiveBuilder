Goldsmiths 0 - 6 IC I
This was our first official game of
the season. A bit of trip to get to
their grounds, but we were there
nice and early and got ready for
the game. We started off a bit
rusty, but after the first 5 minutes,
we came back to take complete
control of the game.Everyone was
working hard and putting in the
effort, and we started looking real-
ly dangerous going forward and
created a pile of chances, but just
couldn't finish them. Finally,
about 35 minutes into the game,
Alan cleverly took a free kick while
they were sorting out their wall,
curling the ball over it, making it
1-0.
We didn't manage to score
again that half, but knew we could
do better than that, so we came
out having decided to win this
one. Our second goal didn't take
long, with Mark delivering a free
kick to the far post, Alan linking
up to finish it with a power head-
er. 2-0! We kept our foot down,
scoring again within a couple of
minutes. Some great movement in
the middle and down the right, a
good ball in from Mark, a set up
by Oli and 3-0 it was by Joss. We
were all over them and knew we
could score more. Jeff, who'd
come on for Anis, got the ball
inside their box, smashing past
the keeper...4-0. There was still
some time left in the game, and
we had to make something of it.
Mark, going past everyone down
the right, put a great ball in the
box for Mathan to put the 5th one
away, bottom right corner. A cou-
ple of minutes before the end we
got another one, Mark's brilliant
through ball to Jeff, who brought it
down nicely and finished it easily,
to end it 6-0.
Good performance all round,
but they weren't the best side
we've played against, so no need
to get carried away...
Kent II 0 - 1 IC III
The team had to leave an hour
early to travel to Canterbury via
tube, train and bus, and at the
end we were still left with a long
walk to find the club house and
pitch.
The team were immediately put
into a state of shock by Gary
deciding to prance around the
changing rooms wearing only his
newly bought black man thong -
not a pretty sight I assure you. On
the pitch IC started slowly, unable
to keep possession and for long
periods of time and we spent most
of the first half chasing the ball.
Chris Jermyn strained his thigh at
the beginning of the first half and
with Henry being our only substi-
tute, a straight swap was made
and we had our midfield captain
playing up front, or at least
attempting to as I often found
myself further up the field. Our
defence held strong and for all
their possession Kent made very
few chances and were unable to
score. This took us into half time
at nil nil. We were tired and knew
that we had to get more of the ball
in the second half and keep pos-
session, however we still felt con-
fident that we could go out there
and win the match. We started
the second half brightly and we
scored early on with Henry toe
poking the ball through the keep-
ers legs. This lead to another spell
of very little possession, however
our fitness didn't seem too bad
and we were able to chase back
and defend well. Towards the end
we had another decent chance,
this time Henry was unfortunate
and the keeper made a good save.
Towards the end the match was
tense and we just managed to
hold on for a well deserved away
win, which was a good reward for
all our efforts.
Reading I 1 - 2 IC I
BUSA has always proved to be a
tough competition, and our first
game in it this year proved to be
no exception.
We had to make our way to
Reading. Got there a bit a late, as
they gave us no instructions to get
to their pitch, which we thought
was very nice of them! Got out
really fired up for the game but
didn't start as well as we might
have done. They started better
than us and took control of the
game for the first 15 minutes. It
was about then we decided to
start playing a bit of football. We
evened up the game and looked
dangerous when going forward. It
was clear this was going to be a
tough one and we had to fight to
win it. We threatened them a cou-
ple of times, but they managed to
score first, a good move and finish
to be fair. But we weren't gonna
give up just like that. We fought,
and managed to pull one back. A
well deserved goal, quick pass
from Tim to Left Back Ant,
Straight to Joss, switching play to
the right to Mark, who combined
with Anis beautifully, to score.
That was how the first half ended.
In the second half we came on
really determined to fight harder,
as winning the game was what we
were there for. We were now look-
ing a lot better than them and
much more likely to score. And so
it was! A sweet chip ball by Oli
behind the defence to Nathan,
who took it on and finished easily
and confidently past the keeper.
After this we didn't let our per-
formance drop although they did
put pressure on us. They had one
or two chances, but so did we.
Neither of us managed to score,
so 2-1 it was!
First BUSA game, a convincing
win against a very good side.
Keep this up boys and lots more
will come!
