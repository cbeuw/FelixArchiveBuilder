attracts. Let us not lose sight of this
fact, otherwise I fear that Sir
Richard's latest, corporate experi-
ment, will be a disaster for the UK,
signalling the end of the right to a
top-class university education for all,
and a slippery slope towards a two-
tiered, segregated society such as
the United States, where ethics are
second to the dollar.
For a man whose CV professes
"humble beginnings", it appears
that Sir Richard suffers from severe
amnesia. Someone as clearly talent-
ed as himself would probably never
have had the chance to achieve his
full potential if our education system
was self-funding and socially exclu-
sive, like it is in the USA. Hence it is
very worrying indeed that most peo-
ple, except for Sir Richard himself,
know that intelligence has no
respect for money and social-class.
Yet it is what has made Imperial
College great. So why may we ask
are we allowing such a man to con-
duct his get-rich-quick experiment
on Imperial, and be at the helm of
this ill-planned voyage to certain dis-
aster?

Dear Felix,
What is going on at Imperial?
Don't let them introduce top up fees
of up to £10,500!!! I most certainly
would not have come to study at
Imperial if I had to pay that much.
Most people would not be able to
afford it!
What's this about a merger with
UCL? In the news I read that the
merger was for academic reasons
and not economic. They also
claimed that they not 'anticipate'
any staff reductions. Do you believe
them?
When I was at Imperial, the
majority of students didn't care
much about College politics and I
assume it's still pretty much the
same. I am as guilty of this as most.
But I think that this is the time for IC
students (past and present) to come
out of the woodwork (and the bar)
and really let their opinions be
known! Don't just let the senior
management just walk all over you!
I say NO to top up fees and NO to
the merger!

Hello World.
Did anyone else notice how
Imperial politics become more and
more alike to real-world politics?
Take this current development for
example: IC plans to merge with
UCL (something strongly against our
interest and therefore potentially
unpopular), and to divert our atten-
tion from this major issue, someone
spreads rumours about top-up fees
that are consequently denied.
It's like a president starting a war
to hide that his economy is going
down the drain.
We should be protesting against
the merger today, not against top-up
fees that won't materialise. The real
threat has been successfully swiped
from our minds with this cunning
trickery.
What kind of pompous ass is it
that says "whoever wants to drag
the university of london tag can go
to brunel"??? I very much hope that
this university is not going to fall into
this kind of elitist "we don't give a
fuck about anyone else cause
they're not a s good as us", which is
why many people dislike Oxford and
Cambridge..
I hope that was coming indeed
from the 70's , and that this idiot
was an aberration even in his own
age.
Yours, Physics
Dear Felix,
This is an open letter to say an
enormous thank you to all the stu-
dents and staff who turned out for
the silent protest last friday morning.
Despite the early hour, cold wind
and persistent rain there were at
least 700 people lining the route all
the way from Sherfield to the
Rector's residence at 170 Queen's
Gate.
Those present at the meeting of
College Council say that the
Governors and academic staff were
impressed by the large numbers
present and the good behaviour
throughout the protest.
Although the decision on tuition
fees still went through, it did so with
a significant amendment in our
favour and an acknowledgement
from the Rector that the views of
students can't just be brushed aside.
We're not going to let this end
here - if you want to get involved
with the second phase of the cam-
paign against increased tuition fees,
visit http://union.ic.ac.uk/no2fees/
for more information.
In summary, the protest made a
positive difference to the outcome of
the meeting, so well done and thank
you for coming along!
Etienne, Katherine, Oliver,
Mustafa, Jude and the rest of the
Protest Co-ordinators.

Dear Will,
I've worked it out, and you're in
big trouble this time... did you really
think no-one would notice? This
whole UCL, top-up fees, blame the
rector nonsense is all your doing
isn't it! Just a big scam to kick the
media group into gear! STOIC *and*
ICRadio live at the same time?
People actually *reading* Felix?
Obviously this is all just a big lie to
get people to start paying attention
to your newspaper and your little
friends in the Media Centre.
Yours aggravatingly, Jess
And Another Thing
Hi Guys,
As a break from all the talk of the
merger, I'm wondering if anyone out
there has managed to claim their
10% discount + student VAT
exemption (-17.5%) from food pur-
chased from IC catering.
I've had several furious rows with
till staff in the MDH and SCR but
since the amazing 10% discount for
IC people was introduced I haven't
been able to get the VAT taken off
my food.
It all seems a bit naughty because
there is a notice beside all the tills
telling me that I can have a (10% +
17.5% =) 27.5% discount but they
won't give it to me. I'd also like to
know what happens to the VAT I
have paid since my purchases have
been put through the till as VAT
exempt (they swipe my student card
after all)...
Hmmm. Has anyone had more
luck than me?
