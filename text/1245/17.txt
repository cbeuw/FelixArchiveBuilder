Various 3/5
Big Beach Boutique
This compilation has music from
the massive free gig on Brighton
beach during the summer by
Norman Cook. It's not the com-
plete set, and he used Midfield
General to mix this album as
well. The album contains songs
which are eclectic but still have
some of his house roots.
The album kicks off with
Midfield General's Reach Out, a
nice chilling song which has a
rasping chorus with Linda Lewis
who sounds similar to Macy
Gray. It mixes to the only Fatboy
Slim track Talkin 'bout my Baby
(not including his involvement
with the Might Dub Katz). It's
not his strongest track but it
does mix well.
The track selection is filled
with songs which I've heard but
didn't know the name of, for
example Tim Deluxe's It Just
Won't Do. Other notable tracks
are the classic Groove Armada's
Superstylin' and the mind
numbingly overplayed X Press
2's Lazy. The compilation seems
to dip at the end with songs
which aren't up to the same
quality as the beginning.
However, it does pick up, with
the surprise inclusion of the All
Saints' Pure Shores, which is an
excellent song to finish a set
right next to the beach..
If you went to this gig, you
might want to buy this album for
nostalgic reasons. Otherwise it's
a tidy compilation which really
depends if you're a fan of
Norman Cook's taste in music.

Cabaret Voltaire
Nag Nag Nag - Mixes Nova mute
4/5
At first I used to hate that kind of
recycled albums; using old stuff,
asking several DJs to collaborate
in order to make them squelch
that little bit out of the anonymity,
making shiny new money. With
this album, I can drop a very little
piece of my prejudice. For those
who don't know, Cabaret
Voltaire's NagNagNag, released in
79, is a real punk song with
Bontempi beats instead of drums,
additive voice samples and elec-
tronic guitar-like layer. The vocals
are also industrially modified; we
can say that it's a Kraut-rock
song. As the term 'innovators' has
recently been applied to Cabaret
Voltaire, it would have been
regressive to ask some existing so-
called punk bands to cover
NagNagNag.
What makes that song (and the
band, I suppose) so fascinating is
that it is located at a limit, a bor-
der. In the course of the album,
the DJs try to recreate that enjoy-
able feeling of transition (the first
two versions are remixes by Tiga
& Zyntherius) or use elements set
down by Cabaret Voltaire to cre-
ate a new current electronic piece
and finally go across the border
(like the last version).
The third (remix by Akufen) is
really pleasant. They use the gui-
tar-like part as a noisy, dull under
layer for sketches of the original
voice. The beat is a kind of bossa
rhythm, very sweet and she (or
he) inserts fly's farts and other
very appreciable crummy sounds.
The piece is pretty cool and
makes this album rather not bad,
above all for the C.V. fiends.

The Vines - Outtatheway
The Vines are still riding high
with this, their third single
from the highly acclaimed
album Highly Evolved. There is
a lot of hype behind this band
with many critics drawing par-
allels between them and
Nirvana, but not to worry too
much, a lot of the praise they
have received is justified. This
single isn't as catchy as Get
Free but it is not a problem. It's
still something good to shout
along to. These guys will be
playing in London at the begin-
ing of next month, so go get
yourself a ticket and see what
ail the hype is about.
4/5
Sean the dude
British Sea Power - Childhood
Memories
This is a very pretty song, and
somewhat reminiscent of
Fleetwood Mac. They keep it
quite chilled and pull it off
nicely, even saving some mad
noises for the end of the song.
Simple lyrics and pleasant
sounds await you. An original
and unique band. Check them
out.
4/5
Little Hell - Everybody's Cursed
There doesn't really seem to be
anything new here - it's a bit
glam, with a nice clangy
bassline and cutting guitars
but that is where it ends. I
wish it was toned down a bit.
It's very hard to take seriously.
I'm sure this must be a spoof
band because the lyrics are so
ridiculous: "I've been saving to
fill your grave in, so here's a
bag of dirt".
About 20 years too late...
Sorry guys.
