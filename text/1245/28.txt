Miners Virgins
ICSM 0 - 5 RSM
Tears were brought to the eyes of
many on Wednesday when the
Royal School of Mines football
team beat the medics by the most
convincing of margins. Though for
the RSM it was a normal
Wednesday at work, having won
their fourth game in a row, now
topping the ULU 2nd Division.
It all started beautifully with the
cheap return fare to the football
ground and it then went from
good to brilliant when RSM scored
three quick goals in succession.
The first, from the legendary mid-
fielder James Dean, the second
from Paul Talbot, our own bulldog
who never gives up the chase,
who with his back to goal, some-
how pulled it out the bag to spin
and shoot. Before the end of the
first half another one of our leg-
endary players - James Stewart -
ran on to a long ball, and flicked it
over the goalie. To be fair, a Medic
would have cleared it, had he not
fallen on his arse.
Second half, storming Gareth
Northam ran through the entire
medic team and when he ran out
of pitch decided to pull one back
to a Mr. Kan Niwho who slotted
home a beautiful side foot volley.
The fifth and final goal was scored
by Rob "Shampoo Officer"
Thomas, when after a handball in
the box, he stepped up to place
the ball in the bottom right hand
corner off the penalty spot, amaz-
ingly. This team effort would not
have happened if it weren't for the
fantastic duo Dougal Tyrie and
Russel Tailing, who provide the
spinal cord of the whole team.
Benoit "Bartez" incidentally had
an interesting trip to the surburbs
of London, by being introduced to
the specialty of "Fish & Chips".
Big shout out to Bitchin' Becky
from ULU for not promoting us out
of this league, 0-5, thanks.

Surrey 10 - 5 IC Virgins
We won but we lost... Cryptic?
Not really, we arrived at Surrey
gagging for some action to find
that their referee didn't turn up, so
they conceded and we got the
BUSA points, yeah baby yeah!
So we scored out first try of the
season, beautifully executed by
Aoife - and if you don't know hot
to pronounce her name, you
should've read last weeks match
report! The try originated from the
back of a ruck, the ball travelling
down the line with stunning preci-
sion, getting to Aoife who ran
through at least three attempted
tackles at high speed, side
stepped the most beautiful side-
step and followed up with a sprint
to score under the posts.
They scored two lucky trys, but
our tackling left a little to be
desired and they did manage to
break our line.
Comedy moments have to be
Muttley finding her doppleganger,
standing in the scrum was jut like
looking in the mirror, freaky!
This week we pay homage to
Curly Claire and our new spangly
shirts now have pink collars. We
love you Claire and your Ref...
Forward and Back of the match
go to Kitty and Aoife (again) for
being good, really, supporting us
and all that good rugby type style
stuff. So for their efforts they
downed a pint each with Fresher
Jess, for being a match virgin.
Oh, and kids, we have two new
romances for you following last
weeks drunken Wednesday night.
I'll keep you updated, of course.
Congratulations to the IC
Ultimate beginners team who
recently beat everyone from
UCL, Royal Holloway, University
of Surrey, LSE and Brunei.
