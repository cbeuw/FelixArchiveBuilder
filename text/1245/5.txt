Wye Freshers Week 2002
Hello! Welcome to the first arti-
cle from Wye by someone at
Wye! Like it or not, we are here
and it'll take a while before we
go away again. Let's start with
Freshers Week.
Well, another year begins and,
yes, I know this is a bit late. So
what? We all like a bit of variety.
Freshers Week for us country
bumpkins down in Wye is still a
big thing, even though student
numbers are low. This year, with
a first year intake of only 55 (8
of which are blokes (Help us!)),
it has been a challenge. But, we
gave it a go.
Monday saw the infamous JSF
disco. For those of you who don't
know, the JSF (or Jock Strap
Farmers) is one of our drinking
clubs, described as a group of
guys who "work on being com-
plete yobs, don't know the mean-
ing of a quiet drink and take
pleasure in drinking anything
which resurfaces". Their
Freshers Night is always a bit of
a mess and this year wasn't a big
exception. Our poor Union Bar
found itself covered in trees,
shavings and beer cans aplenty,
but once the ... er ... civilised
act of... well ... let's class it as
anatomy chundering for the sake
of the press (I'm sure you know
what I mean) got going and the
Yard was brought out, it turned
into a bit of mess.
Tuesday, Scottish Reeling,
awarded Adam Trehane with the
Best Drunken Injury Award for
managing to injure himself in
classic style and still being able
to dance on.
Wednesday was a pub crawl in
Canterbury, as usual, with no
major occurrences, except for the
Freshers slowly getting used to
being out of the recesses they
call their rooms.
Thursday night, a night spent
in a local pub, The Compasses,
was a bit of a milestone, wasn't
it Andy? Yes, that's right. Some
of you know him, others don't,
but Andy Shore, our respectable
Union President, did a classic.
Armed with two friends, a
Fresher and no mobile with a sig-
nal, Andy decided to walk the
good 5 miles across the Kent
Countryside over barbed wire
and through someone's conser-
vatory. About 2.30am, after
falling asleep in the middle of the
road, our Welfare Officer (Maria)
got a phone call. When asked,
"Where are you?" Andy replies,
"at a T-junction". Nice one.
Friday, the Freshers Ball with a
theme of Lord Of The Rings,
was, I am told, a good night.
Unfortunately, I was kidnapped
by a bottle of wine and plenty of
vodka beforehand and, well, I
wish someone would tell me the
rest. All I know was I fell up the
stairs and woke up in pain.
Oops. Apparently, everyone loved
the ball and it was nice to see all
the Freshers finally in the open,
even if Ross was in a clown suit
as the Garter's mascot. Bless.
Nevertheless, it was a good
week. We'll get those little peo-
ple out eventually, but, oh, how
we suffer.
I was planning to put sports
results etc. in this as well, but
since no one's actually written
anything you'll have to make do
with this. Hopefully it'll be more
substantial next time. Hint hint.
