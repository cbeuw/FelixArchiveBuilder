Supergrass
Life On Other Planets
5/5
If in ten years time Supergrass
are still making music, then
surely all of us will have a bright
future to look forward to. Their
distinctive blend of pop-lyrics
and retro sounds have made
them last a lot longer than their
contemporaries of the Brit-band
explosion of the mid-nineties.
And if this album is any indica-
tion of things to come, we can
expect to see them around for
some time.
As with a lot of their music,
Life On Other Planets seems to
be music from a different era. It
is as if it was originally recorded
in the mid-seventies and then
sealed in the Blue Peter time
capsule along with a copy of The
Daily Mirror and a signed pic-
ture of John Craven. When I say
this, I mean that like a lot of
music of that era, Supergrass
have no fear of putting tasty
electric riffs and catchy pop
lyrics together, resulting in
something that is decidedly
bouncy and optimistic yet with a
suggestion of maturity.
Life On Other Planets is an
album that flows like lemonade
from a glass bottle: cleanly,
quickly and with a lot of effer-
vescence. Grace, the first single
taken from the album, sets the
tone for the album with the line
'we jumped all night on your
trampoline'.
Supergrass: keeping the
nation pogoing.

FABRICLIVE. 06
Grooverider
This is the sixth release from the
FABRICLIVE series. The idea is
that Fabric releases mixes from
their resident DJs and punters
can subscribe online to receive
(at a discount from the real
retail price) their latest dose of
breakbeat through the post.
Grooverider is the latest to
receive the FABRICLIVE treat-
ment, and this CD does make
for interesting listening.
Compared to some of the drum
and bass dross that is churned
out on a regular basis,
Grooverider's choice of tracks
and mixing style (jigsaw mixes,
VIP dubbing and quick cuts)
harks back to his early days as
an acid house impresario.
This set starts with some
blinding tracks {Got Me Burning
by Peshay and Alien Girl, by Ed
Rush, Optical and Fierce), but
the tempo worked up at the start
seems to almost lose control
mid-way through, and seriously
heavy bass beat takes over. The
tracks get dark and dirty, the
crowd - you would imagine - are
going wild, and it is only
towards the last third of the set
that you get a sense of
Grooverider's range as a DJ,
when the tracks seem to take on
an almost schizophrenic quality,
dodging from laid back, almost
chilled drum and bass, to men-
talism on a grand scale!
Stand-out tracks on this CD
would have to include Optimus
Prime's Amen Slag and
Grooverider's VIP mixes of
Deadline by Digital and Back
for More by Influx Datum -
tracks that offer both a chill out
and a party at the same time.
Perhaps it is the fact that
Grooverider has been around
since the early days - when
house turned into jungle, which
then turned into drum and bass.
Perhaps it's because he's not
afraid to throw all these styles
together, mix them up and see
what happens. Whatever it is, if
you love drum and bass you will
not be disappointed. If you can
only afford one CD in the FAB-
RICLIVE series, this is the one to
get!

Singles
Moby - In This World
Another Moby single, another
soulful blues sample, sung by
another unknown artist.
Anyone who's heard Natural
Blues (and let's face it, who
hasn't?) will know what to
expect. It seems the skin-head-
ed songster has discovered a
simple formula for chillout tune
success - gospel tinged vocals,
simple piano refrain, dreamy
backing strings and relaxed
house beat - and is churning
out single after single of the
stuff. Now, don't get me wrong;
I liked Play as much as the
next man, but I just hope he
runs out of old bluegrass
recordings soon, so he can
start making something a little
different.
3/5
Parva - Hessels
Tom Bell
This was good, but not dirty
and innovative enough for me -
like a good power-rock song
should. The bass is particularly
attractively tight, the guitars
are sharp, totally high-fidelity.
The whole song sounds nice
and nostalgically, like one of
those on the debut album of
Snuff. It seems as though the
lead singer of Parva wanted to
make his song edgier like those
of Snuff, and in trying to
achieve that aim, he decided,
at regular points, to shout gen-
tly. And that's the problem
because his gentle shouts are
like flat tyres; the song is work-
ing but there is also something
bothersome. The band act with
kitsch effect because the anger
that the singer tries to express
is the kind of anger that hits
you when you realize that there
aren't any cereals left for your
breakfast.
