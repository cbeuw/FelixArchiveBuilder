Greetings one and all from me, Boris the Inquisitive Goat. I'll be
your crossword compiler for the forseeable future and here is the
first attempt - be gentle with me. Last week's winner was Neil
Yorke-Smith, IC-PARC, so congratulations - another entry for the
extravagant extravaganza commonly known as the crossword
tombola, the winner of which wil receive an unspecified prize of
immense proportions. Keep your answers coming in to the Felix
office or send them to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk - you know the drill.
What with my new-found fame expanding faster than a hamster in
a microwave, I've decided to launch a campaign to have the new
college formed by merging IC and UCL named after me! Boris the
Inquisitive Goat College, London (which helpfully abbreviates to
BIG) will be a name that strikes fear into the hearts of other aca-
demics across the world! I'm off to e-mail the Rector about it...
