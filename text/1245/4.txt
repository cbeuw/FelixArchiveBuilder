Editorial
Even as we speak, I am being
reminded of a time when I was,
and I quote, "deeply pissed off and
angry" during the last summer
term. I don't remember why, but so
it must be, and apparently in that
time I wrote a suitably offensive
editorial that totally failed to raise
any sort of controversy at all. Last
week I feel I did a similar thing, but
politically instead of personally, and
again not one letter of abuse.
You're all either very open minded,
very polite, or lazy. I know which
my money is on.
So in an attempt to make my life
more interesting (I'm going to do a
PhD one day to study what the
maximum amount of interest one
life can take is) I'm going to be very
normal this week. Or so I intend.
To start with, I'm going to tell you
about a website. I very rarely do
this, and were it not for the fact
that I'm positively avoiding talking
about anything political, I would
probably put it somewhere else,
but, as it is, here it shall be in my
very own editorial. It's called
www.gonumber.net, and I really
haven't been paid to talk about it: I
just think it's a really good idea.
It's basically like having your own
business card on the web, where
you can put all sorts of bits of infor-
mation about yourself (mostly for
keeping in contact at the moment),
different bits of which can be
viewed by the whole world, or just
by your mates. They've started by
trying to sell this to students,
because your details change the
whole time, but with this, you keep
the same ID on the website for life
(and you only pay once), and then
you can change all the info in there
as often as you want.
I'm not usually easily taken in,
but I liked the idea, and the web-
site is nice too, so go and have a
look at it, is my advice. There are
posters all around college you can
look at too, if you're so inclined.
Incidentally if any company is
now reading this and asks me to
'boost' their product, I won't.
So now onto something else (I
wonder if I've offended anyone yet,
except Al, of course.) Female eroti-
ca. I've been thinking about this
recently, and have discovered that
there is no erotica (what men call
porn) for girls to look at. I have
found (but not in the way you're
thinking) that most women don't
like the same stuff that men do,
and prefer something with slightly
more story line and romance. So
researching this (for purely intellec-
tual reasons, of course), I turned to
the friend in an hour of need, the
internet, which furnished me with
exactly nothing. Now I know girls
have sex drives. And I suspect that
visual stimulus can be... well...
stimulating. So why is there noth-
ing for the discerning female ero-
tophile?
To counter this, I have decided to
start a revolution, or perhaps my
own company, to provide for this
hole in the market, and am asking
you, mostly the girls, admittedly, to
get involved in the largest female
erotica based survey the college
has ever seen! Although I'm not
really sure how.
Talk about anticlimax. This has
all just come to me as I've been
writing this, so I'm not really organ-
ised in my head with respect to
how this would work, but I'm get-
ting pretty psyched about it, I can
tell you.
So, if you (male or female) have
any ideas about the sort of ques-
tions I should ask, or if you just give
the smallest most remote flying fig
about the idea, then e-mail me at
Felix on felix@ic.ac.uk where I will
be waiting to see if a single person
replies.
Then I will create the survey, and
there will be a huge prize as an
incentive for bearing your deepest
darkest fantasies to me, a physics
graduate: but I met a girl once,
honest, guv'nor.
While I am serious, it's worth
noting that I seem to be much bet-
ter at being offensive when I'm not
really trying...
Come and find
your future!
