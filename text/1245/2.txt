Crash!
One of the minibuses provided by
the Union to clubs and societies was
severely damaged in a crash last
week, sending the Union's transport
arrangements into chaos.
Nobody was hurt in the accident,
which left the unfortunate bus over-
turned on a grass verge. The bus,
affectionately known as 'Fleb' may
be written-off after the accident dur-
ing a tour by the Mountaineering
Club. Unfortunately, the bus' MOT,
declaring the vehicle roadworthy,
had recently expired leaving uncer-
tainty over whether insurance will
cover the damage.
Other clubs booked to use the bus
have had either to cancel their trips
or to hire private transport for their
excursions. Private hire requires a
driver aged over twenty-five, further
limiting the number of qualified driv-
ers available to those clubs with can-
celled Union bookings.
An official responsible for transport
in the Union said that clubs would
not be refunded for money spent on
private hire due to concern that there
would be a "landslide" of claims for
compensation - even if refunds were

limited to those clubs with existing
bookings.
The loss of 'Fleb' brings the total of
available minibuses down to five out
of the Union's fleet of eleven, though
one of those is apparently "dodgy"
while the other "has no oil", leaving
only three that are genuinely usable.
The rest are awaiting the MOT cer-
tificates that the crashed bus lacks.
Felix could not establish any kind
of repair and certification schedule
for the buses, nor had any decision
been made about whether 'Fleb'
would be written-off as the issue
went to press.
In a new development, Imperial
College Mountaineering Club may
now change their name to Minibus
Crashers. AW

Award for IC Radio
IC Radio's science-based talk
show Mission Impossible was
nominated for a national Student
Radio Award at a ceremony held
in London last week.
The show, put together by
Imperial's Science
Communication stu-
dents, was one of six
nominees in the cate-
gory of Best Speech-
Based Programme
(Factual).
To quote one of the
presenters, "Mission
Impossible is to sci-
ence what napalm is
to a bale of hay,
choosing to ignite the subject
with a refreshing brand of
humour and intrigue." The show
blends together a variety of wide-
ranging ingredients, from topical
science news to the radio soap
opera Empirical College.
The Student Radio Awards
began in 1996 and are strongly
supported by the industry, with
sponsors including BBC Radio 1,
BBC Radio Five Live and the
Radio Academy. Many past win-
ners and nominees have
launched successful careers in
professional radio thanks to the
Awards. In 2000, IC Radio's web
site www.icradio.com
won the award for the
Best New Media
J Innovation.
The nominations
were announced at
several regional parties
across Britain, with
the London event held
at LSE Students'
Union. Up-and-coming
bands Careless and Bushbaby
provided the music for a packed
student audience. Also present
were Radio l's Emma B, XFM's
Kevin Greening and the contro-
versial presenter Jon Holmes.
The main ceremony, hosted by
Emma B, will take place at
Goldsmiths College on Thursday
November 14. Dave Edwards
