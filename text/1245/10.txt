Your Letters
Take One UCL Merger
Dear Felix,
I have an indecent tendency to
ramble so before the off, as it were,
I'd like to set a few things straight.
Firstly, I am definitely in favour of a
possible merger with UCL - I think
that beyond the immediate obvious
problems everyone has to admit that
the subject range here at Imperial is
pretty narrow and in some senses
crippling. Secondly, I have much
respect for the union 'hacks' and
sabbaticals that do a fantastic job
against multiple committee odds,
and provide pretty good support to
our active (?) student population
(and I'm not just trying to score
brownie points here). With that out
the way, the point I would like to
address is that, however desirable,
the actual likelihood of such a merg-
er with UCL seems to me pretty
damned slim. This view has been
prompted from recent events within,
of all places, the IC Canoe Club.
Bear with me on this one, and let
me explain: I have been a canoe
obsessional for a far few years now,
and over the past three years I've
slowly earned canoe club guru sta-
tus. This IC club is a bit of an oddi-
ty in the fact that if you're a student
in that strange amalgamation that is
University of London, and fancy a
spot of Whitewater canoeing, we're
pretty much the only place that you
can come (ULU run a canoe club
but as far as I know they're yet to
leave the swimming pool - no
offense intended). With this in mind,
at the start of the year we tend to
recruit not only the usual crop of IC
freshers, but also a significant num-
ber of dedicated paddlers from UCL,
LSE, etc. The beginning of this year
has proved slightly different howev-
er, due in no small way to a union
official watching someone in a UCL
rugby top filling out one of our mem-
bership forms.
In a very understandable way, IC
Union want the money they put in to
the IC club to benefit IC students. To
this end IC students receive sub-
sidised travel, accommodation, and
so on while students from other
London universities do not and have
to pay up the full whack. This is all
fairly standard, but a point that I
think is not yet widely realised, and
must apply to many other clubs
than our own, is that being in a
London university belonging to ULU
does not necessarily allow you to
join an IC club as an unsubsidised
member. Imperial and the university
involved has also to sign a 'recipro-
cal agreement' first. Following the
aforementioned UCL rugby top inci-
dent, an amiable chat and rather
incriminating piece of A4 paper from
the union ensued. Although Imperial
seems to have 'reciprocal agree-
ments' with every London universi-
ty/college under the sun (the list
filled a double columned A4 page),
UCL is nowhere to be found.
Apparently the two universities
could not come to an agreement in
what is surely a fairly simple issue.
I'm not an insurance policy leg-
end, and I certainly don't know all
the ins and outs of this case (in fact,
I don't even know what the 'recipro-
cal agreement' is), but this omission
raises a few interesting questions.
Considering UCL members would
be unsubsidised (and thus 'steal' no
IC money), what really is the prob-
lem with them joining our club? Our
members from UCL don't just see
our stand at freshers fair and fancy a
crack, they have been
referred/searched us out and thus
tend to be fairly experienced pad-
dlers. In a sport with a by necessity
high experienced to inexperienced
ratio needed, do the union really
want us to expel our experienced
UCL members and effectively be
less safe on the river? Don't get me
wrong - this club exists to introduce
and cultivate the skills of IC students
in the back art that is travelling
down vicious rivers in a small plas-
tic thing, but quality, safe paddlers
come far and few between, and I
honestly think it is wrong to ignore
what UCL students have to offer.
But I'm already off on a tangent -
the main point is that although this
is obviously an Imperial and UCL
union related matter rather than an
academic institutional concern, I
can't help feeling it has implications
for a possible merger. If IC and UCL
cannot agree to something as simple
as a clubs and societies 'reciprocal
agreement', surely this doesn't bode
too well for agreement on no doubt
exceedingly complicated issues that
would arise in relation to full UCL/IC
integration. UCL and IC merger? It'll
be a full five to ten years before even
the basic framework is sorted out, if
you ask me, and by then I'll be long
gone.
Cynically,

It is clear from reading our new
Rector's prose, that he intends to
manage it like a huge business cor-
poration ("need to change our
brand", "international market",
"merger"...). While there's nothing
inherently wrong with this, and
sometimes a little dynamism is
good, I hope we all recognise that IC
is very different from a car or
(indeed) a pharmaceutical company.
In all this talk of "opening up" and
being "competitive" there is a big
danger that research (like pure
mathematics or physics etc.) that
does not bring in immediate divi-
dends, or grants from the US
Defence department or GSK, will be
axed. The independence of Science
from commercial interests is also a
fundamental issue.
We should keep in mind the func-
tions of a university, and keep our
priorities well in check.
Well, I could also rant on the dan-
gers of the GATS agreement on lib-
eralisation of educational services
but...

Add Some Top Up Fees
I am absolutely appaled by the
events of the last few days and the
hastiness with which the rector of
my alma mater, Imperial College, is
trying to push through his own
agenda. I hope sincerely that the
entire college shows their disgust at
the proposals and the way in which
both staff and students are being
totally walked-over.
Imperial College is an outstanding
place to study but I fear that if we do
not speak out, it will soon turn into
Sir Richard's dream - a mega- insti-
tution for the elite, where money
and not intelligence dictate who gets
in. Imperial is a top institution,
respected the world over, for its aca-
demic excellence. It is not a blue-
chip company; it is an institution
which has built its reputation thanks
to the abilities of the people it
"On behalf of Imperial
College Union, I would
like to thank all the stu-
dents who attended the
protest, and all those who
helped co-ordinate the
event"
