The Coral
Shepherd's Bush Empire - Thursday 10th October
mmm &
Thursday evening, and the
Shepherd's Bush Empire is sold
out for a band which was totally
unknown a few months ago.
Following the release of their
debut album, this band from
Liverpool is doing its first UK
tour. Their music is "psychedelic
rock", a genre ideal for radio
play but can songs like
Dreaming of You, their most
recent single, have the same
effect live? That was the big
question before the gig.
Opening with Spanish Man, a
very short but intense song, they
invited the London audience into
their imagination-filled world.
And it worked! The six members
gave an excellent live perform-
ance. They displayed no fear on
stage and showed a maturity
seldom seen in such young peo-
ple (the members are aged
between 18 and 21). I don't say
it was the most entertaining
concert I've been to but they
played their album and that was
enough. The strength and diver-
sity of their songs made it work.
From the beginning of the
year, England has been intro-
duced to new bands such as The
Electric Soft Parade and The
Music; new guys who give a
breath of fresh air to the Brit
pop-rock scene after the
Oasis/Blur era. But our boys fol-
low the new fashion of short
gigs; only 50 minutes from
beginning to end. A little too
short, perhaps?
I don't judge an album or a
performance instantly, but I
believe that a band has to give
more on stage than in the stu-
dio. The Coral did their show
and you had to "take it or leave
it". Why no encore? I'm sure
that they had other songs to
play; there were two new tracks
on their last single! Perhaps
because it was 50 intense min-
utes full of happiness without
intermission, I was begging for
more. It's too late to see them in
London now. So get the album
immediately! Or you will miss
out on one of the best albums of
the year 2002!

The Coral's self-titled debut
album is out in the shops now.
Richard Ashcroft 3/5
Human Conditions
The bright summery feeling of
the first single, Check The
Meaning, from his latest album
is guaranteed to make you
smile. The perfect autumn song,
reminiscent of summer and yet
cozy enough to make you want
to dive back under the duvet and
just listen
And that is exactly what this
album is, 'cozy'. While it doesn't
represent a massive departure
from the style Richard Ashcroft
had cultivated whilst in The
Verve and in his previous solo
releases, it does offer exactly
what any die-hard fan of north-
ern soul will want - songs with
strong melodies and strong sen-
timents.
At times Ashcroft is in danger
of sounding a bit like a new-age
hippie, singing 'Nature is the
law, baby' to a chilled-out, hazy
chorus line.
However, the range exhibited
in this album, from love-ballads
to songs describing the harsh
realities of life, is impressive. It
acts as an indication of him
achieving a new level of accom-
plishment in his craft as a song-
writer.
Richard Ashcroft sings to you
in this album from the enviable
vantage point of knowing that
what he has crafted will not only
be popular with his loyal fans,
but also accessible to the rest of
the record-buying public, con-
taining - as it does here - a
noticeable polish compared to
some of his previous releases,
which had more 'rough and
readiness' about them.
The combination of guitar
band music with orchestral
accompaniment still works well
and one of the tracks, Bright
Lights, offers a hint of some-
thing different - experimentation
with new percussion styles
resulting in an altogether more
interesting, complex brand of
music.
In this latest album, there is
an overriding feeling of darkness
which is, unexpectedly, almost
comforting. Listening to this is
like the return of an old
friend....and as the man himself
says 'It sure feels like I've been
here before'.

Albums
All Systems Go - Mon Chi Chi
All Systems Go sound exactly
like an American high school
TV show. Normally, this is no
reason for complaint, but
they're Swedish and while
you can hear (if you listen
really carefully) bits of The
Soundtrack of Our Lives and
maybe even The Hives, they
still sound like they belong in
California. Sounding like you
belong in California typically
means you are a big, dumb,
vacuous, pop-punk for school
girls, which coincidentally is
pretty much how ASG sound.
They take the tried and
tested route of picking three
chords, playing them in
slightly differing orders
around catchy three minute
pop songs without taking
themselves seriously at all,
and it pays off. Instead of the
usual dirge about girls,
school and how things are so
like, totally unfair man, they
sing about big dumb things
like motorbikes, robots, girls,
revenge and the temporary
loss of sanity. All of which
makes it far less tiresome and
a great deal more enjoyable
than the rest of the punk-boy-
bands around at the moment.
It may not be clever, but it
certainly is big.
3/5
