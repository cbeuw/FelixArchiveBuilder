FELIX, NOVEMBER 12th 1976 - 9
Exiled boys a
Croydon hit
Wishbone A s h at Fairfield
At 10.11pm on Sunday
evening Laurie Wisefield
raised his hands in the air,
looked aloft at the large
crowd rapidly festooning itself
around the stage, and asked
everyone to c l a p along to the
first of two encores 'Bad
Weather Blues'.
He had no need to worry,
Croydon had proved a good
gig for Wishbone A s h , whose
year of e x i l e ' in America has
produced a tighter and more
hard hitting ' A s h than I had
hitherto seen.
The lads play with more
vehemence now than when I
last saw them, at Reading
F e s t i v a l in 1975. They c a n
turn on the tender tones when
needed but somehow managed
to lose the e s s e n c e of ' T i m e
Was'. The menacing moments
of this crowd warmer were
certainly there, but the
delicacy was done s a c r i f i c i e d
to a rough rock ' n ' roll treat-
ment.
The rest of the evening was
a different story. The more
earthy and s i m p l i s t i c approach
the band now take to their
music certainly adds fire and
excitement, although I remained
unimpressed with the new
numbers in the set (from the
'New England' L P due for
release soon). The first song
I managed to recognise was
'The King Will Come' from the
Argus album, Here the heavier,
more involved guitar work has
reinforced the introduction,
whilst more collaboration
within the band on v o c a l s has
produced a harsh, gutsy,
sound that somehow remains
penetrating and strangely
melodic.
A torrrent of guitar riffs
from the bands guitarists
introduced 'The Warrior',
another crowd-pleaser. The
track does have some tender
vocal work, and Martin Turner
H a l l s , Croydon (October 31st)
proved more than adequate
treatment here.
It was not until half-way
through a new number 'Laura
Live', when I was becoming
disinterest in their new work,
that I realised how well
drummer Steve Upton had been
playing. Trouble was he'd been
so on top of the songs from
the start, that I'd almost
forgotten him!
'Persephone' from the
There's the Pub L P was
Andy P o w e l l ' s first chance of
the evening to e x c e l . Andy
and Laurie play musical
jesting, each one vieing for
a better guitar riff. In this
song Andy had the better
themes, managing to straddle
the song well with a mixture
of interwoven guitar l i c k s and
bland up front guitar Work.
Laurie, in a thick ' p i n -
stripe demin' trouser and
waistcoat combination is
equally talented as he showed
on 'The King Will Come' and
'It Started In Heaven, But
Finished With Rock 'n' Roll'.
Despite the r ' n ' r nature of
the latter, it does possess
enough variation to let Laurie
put the band's indelible stamp
on it. A s its sounds bounced
around the h a l l , adding an
enthralling echo to the band,
the mirror ball started spinning
at it looked like the end of the
evening.
Not s o ; 'Time Was' was fol-
lowed by a d a z z l i n g version of
the ever-popular 'Blowing
Free'. And then came the
encores as the crowd spawned
around their heroes, and
Martin Turner started to
undress between numbers.
Just think, another encore and
he'd have been down to h i s
pants!

'II Campiello' by Carlo Goldoni
In presenting '// Campiello'
the enormously talented, and
heavily s u b s i d i s e d , National
Theatre have attempted to
make entertainment from what
can only be described as
T r i v i a . They almost s u c c e e d .
Venetian-born Goldoni wrote
more than 200 plays, most of
them between about 1750 and
1770, and if ' / / ' Campiello'
is a typical example, it is
easy to understand why his
work is almost never performed
nowadays. Although in his
time he was responsible for
transforming the Italian theatre
by changing the Commedia
dell'are from improvisation to
written plays, his writing is
now so far removed from us
in s p a c e , time and culture,
that '// Campiello' is of little
more than passing historical
interest to a modern audience.
Very little actually happens
in the Vetetian square of the
title: lovers quarrel but soon
kiss and make up, neighbours
argue but eventually apologise
and w i c k e d guardians relent.
There is a magnificent
opening to the play, with cast,
musicians and sundries con-
verging towards the stage
from all corners of the auditor-
(Olivier Theatre)
ium, complete with gigantic
puppets and live a n i m a l s .
Beryl R e i d and Peggy Mount
do much to raise the production
(Miss R e i d ' s frequent 'ad-libb-
ing' was one of the best
aspects of the evening) and I
a l s o enjoyed Stephen R e a ' s
wi Id Irish pedlar.
Choreography and costumes
must a l s o be mentioned, since
they contributed well to the
Italian carnival atmosphere:
there, was a gay natural
abandonment about the scenes
in which anything actually
happens.
Unfortunately it's a l l . a
bit like the music of Wagner:
there are some beautiful
moments, but dreadful quarter-
hours. The dialogue is general ly
uninspired and rather boring
(except when the translator
permits one or two Anglo-
Saxon phrases), and the ending
of the play was sentimental to
the point of embarrassment.
I think the director intended
(as did Goldoni) to present a
realistic portrait of the Italian
working c l a s s , but with such
poor material the result is
hollow and inconsequential.
