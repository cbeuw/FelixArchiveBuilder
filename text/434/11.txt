STUDENT WORLD
Hunger Strike
When Central London
' P o l l y ' put the kettle on last
Thursday at the Regent
Street a n d N e w C a v e n d i s h
Street canteens, she soon had
to take it off again — they'd
a l l gone away! T h e canteen
boycott, organised by the
Union a s a protest against
an 18% price-rise a n d the
abolition of the cheaper
'meal of the day', cost the
canteens between £100 a n d
£200, according to the
catering manager. A similar
boycott w a s staged at the
Wells Street canteen the
previous Thursday ( s e e last

Fees Foe
L a n c a s t e r University Senate
last Thursday declared i t s
opposition to the Government's
proposals to increase tuition
fees next September to £650
pa for undergraduates a n d
£750 pa for postgraduates.
T h e Senate a l s o expressed
d i s l i k e of any quota on
Overseas students studying

opposition has been declared
by I C ' s Governing Body

Teaching Lessens
Up lo 30 more c o l l e g e s of
education are threatened with
c l o s u r e , according to a
confidential D . E . S . document,
that has been leaked to the
national press. T h e cuts in
the number of teacher training
places w i l l reduce the entire
system to a mere 45,000
places by 1981, compared
with 114,000 three years ago.
The document, ' T e a c h e r
Training i n the 1980's', which
mentions no colleges by name,
blames public expenditure
cuts and a falling birth rate.
There are a l s o plans for
phasing out the Certificate
of E d u c a t i o n .
