NEWSPAPEH OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Overseas Students
I was disheartened that no member
of the Union Executive attended the
Overseas Students meeting on
Wednesday (see front page).- It was
doubly sad, since over the summer
vacation, I had heard many ideas
from the Exec, aimed at increasing
overseas student participation in
IC Union. Overseas students form
25% of Union membership. They now
face special problems which threaten
their community at IC. The situation
deserves closer attention from ICU.
It is hardly encouraging to active
overseas students to see no lead
given by the Executive, three of
whom sit on the ailing Overseas
Students Committee.
Refectories
In October 1975 a 40% refectory
price increase dramatically cut
Mooney's custom. The Refectory
Committee has seen its error and
proposes no increases for next term.
Its new found policy of finding out
what students want from the catering
system is welcome, but long overdue.
There seems to be no problem at the
Union refectory, where every lunchtime
the queue trails out of the refec. door
and across the foyer. Congratulations
to Mr Mooney on this one, at least.
By the way, if you don't like the
queues, the Union Bar serves sand-
wiches in the Lower Lounge at
lunchtimes. Hot meals at weekends
are also on the cards.
Returning the Compliment
The RCS Union General Committee
decided on Monday that the ICU,
ICWA, C&GU and RSMU Presidents
would only get a single complimentary
ticket to the R C S Silwood Ball.
Formerly they had received a double
ticket. At, say, £15 a double ticket
for this year's formal balls, double
complimentaries add £60 to the
event's bill ie: £1 to each double
bought for Silwood, the ICWA Ball &
Mines Ball, and at least 50p a double
for Guilds Dinner and Dance. Including
F E L I X , N O V E M B E R 12th 1976 - 3
Freshers' Dinners complimentaries,
£350 is 'spent' on free tickets; most
of the tickets are used by the five
Presidents. Numbers at formal balls
are dropping because of the ticket
price ... the solution seems obvious.
Apoligies
Sorry about the state of last week's
editorial, the rush to get F E L I X to
you prevented accurate proof reading
here. Apologies too to Mr Davey,
whose name got spelt three different
ways.
Due to a slight cock-up by myself
the Rag edition of F E L I X will now
be sold on 3rd December. Next week's
edition will photo - preview Rag Week.
Thanks to Omega, the Herriot-Watt
University paper, for allowing us to
use the dalek cartoon last week.
Many thanks to Gill McConway, Ian
Morse, Jen Hardy-Smith, Mark Kuse,
Howard Cheetham, Chris Palmer,
Duncan Suss, Trevor Poole, Terry
Westoby, Andrew Evans, Dave Crabb,
Alison, Mike Slone-Murphy, Jon Lor—,
Tony. Jones and John O'Leary. T a too
anyone else I've forgotten.

L plates for lunacy
Dear S i r , — With reference to
your article headed " M a s c o t
W r a n g l e s " , i n F E L I X N o .
432, we would like to make
several points.
John E l k i n , guildsheet
editor, d i d drive h i s vehicle
at the R C S freshers, and
continued to drive backwards
and forwards, hitting numerous
people. A s Mr E l k i n w a s
reversing, presumably for
another attempt at the crowd,
a wine waiter removed h i s
ignition keys for the safety
of a l l persons present. Theta
then entered the dinner across
the bonnet of the guilds car
as it w a s now blocking the
doors.
Immediately after the
incident, guilds maintained
that Mr E l k i n had not rammed
the freshers and that he
always drove at speed around
this area at that time of night
anyway. However i n the light
of overwhelming evidence to
the contrary, he later told
R C S that he 'DELIBERATELY
RAMMED THE FRESHERS
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT HiS FRIENDS WERE
IN TROUBLE.'
The whole incident w a s
viewed by a least two
members of the guilds e x e c ,
V i c e - P r e s i d e n t , ' Dave Lord
and Hon Sec, Mike Wheatley,
who were both w a i t i n g , along
with a number o f f g u i l d s m a n ,
in the L y o n - P lay fair library.
On noticing that minimal
damage had occured to Mr
E l k i n ' s c a r , Mr Wheatley
said 'RCS are going to pay
for this'. We would like to
point out that damage to
cars c a n be paid for (although
we have no intention of doing
so i n this instance) damage
to people cannot.
Things may have been
different had an attitude,
similar to Mr E l k i n ' s , been
taken by R C S U , and the J 4
van been used to prevent
Mr E l k i n from ramming R C S
freshers escorting T h e t a .
Mr E l k i n may not have been
quite s o happy had the' J 4
(a somewhat larger vehicle)
rammed h i m when the driver
'saw that h i s buddies were
in trouble'!
The R o y a l C o l l e g e of
Science Union feel that the
whole point o f Mascots
attending F r e s h e r s Dinners
has been put in jeopardy by
continued aggravation during
this year's events. During
the first dinner, road blocks
comprising 50gal o i l drums,
breeze b l o c k s , milk-crates,
road signs and scaffolding
poles were placed across
college roads in a n attempt
to prevent Theta from leaving
c o l l e g e , they would have
worked had they not been
noticed during the dinner, a s
they were placed in such
positions as to be likely to
cause v e h i c l e s to c r a s h .
Members of guilds, who have
driven spanner to a n d from
dinners i n the past, agreed
that this ' w a s blatently
dangerous and could have
caused serious injury and
possible loss of life.
At the third dinner ( L i f e
Sciences), Mr E l k i n was seen
on more than one o c c a s i o n
to be driving past the window
of the dinner at speed,
s p o i l i n g the atmoshpere of
the dinner for many people.
Although we do not
object, i n principle, to
v a l i d efforts by guilds to
steal T h e t a , we feel that
by definition, mascotry
should be good-humoured
activity, with no real violence
and definately no actions
which could endanger life
or limb. R C S w i l l continue
to follow these g u i d e l i n e s ,
may we hope that guilds come
to their senses before the
whole thing gets out of
proportion.
We would like to c l o s e
with a 'warning' quote from
a guildsman heavily involved
with spanner at a subsequent
guilds dinner: 'We'd better
/ E d i t o r - C l i v e Dewey>
not have any trouble tonight
or we'11 call the police'.
Y o u r s i n anticipation of
many rumblings from Mr L o r d
and crew.

Dear S i r , — H o w glad I w a s t o
read your expose i n the October
21st i s s u e . It was refreshing to
see reality i n print. T h e
popular music scene i s
definitely, sadly anti-truth,
pro-illusionist and a continuing
negative i n a progressive world.
L e t us see a more detailed
expose o f where i t ' s really at
with the music industry — how
s a l e s of advertising space i n
music papers is linked with
reviews of g i g s , concerts,
singles and albums r e l e a s e s ,
and how double-page spread
" e d i t o r i a l s " are sold at a
price.
And let us have a n expose
of the singles market hype —
where chart material is manu-
factured with certainty of
s u c c e s s , with full awareness of
bad content disregarded i n
favour of the knowledge of
financial profit to be gained
along the routes of planned
marketing c o n s . N o t forgetting
the vulnerability of childrens'
minds, nor that they have no
choice i n what they b u y , for
links e x i s t s between d i s c o s ,
retail shops a n d the charts.
The recording companies have
got it a l l in their control.
I would be glad to s e e y o u
reveal the existence of the
multitude of good, professional
m u s i c i a n s in L o n d o n and around,
and the true artist who struggles
against a l l odds, of whom the
public are hardly l i k e l y to hear
of because of the company-
policy-directed, r e s t r i c t e d ,
hype-minded, frustrated, psuedo-
m u s i c a l dreamers w h o front the
recording companies, w h o w i l l
not l a y then s e l v e s o n the line
for fear of losing the j o b .

Inconsiderate
Dear S i r , — Everyday I come
into C o l l e g e by c a r , a n d to
date have h a d no problems in
parking (I do have a C o l l e g e
P a r k i n g permit). I w a s rather
amazed to find a car d i s p l a y i n g
a d i s a b l e d person's sticker
fetter with an orange day glow
'Thou Shalt N o t . P a r k ' label
stuck on i t s windscreen.
The nature of the (car)
owner's disability made it
impossible for h i m to remove
the sticker without a great
d e a l of help from the C o l l e g e
road sweeper. I realise that
car parking i s limited, but
surely compassion should be
shown in certain c a s e s .
Yours sincerely,
