'Mutter
Refectories-Are you
being served?
Imagine ... sometime i n the
future when the refectory and
bar empire is working smoothly,
N o great losses are ever
incurred, prices a r e s t a b l e ,
and most importantly, the
empire i s catering for your
neetls, ie the service is tailored
to f i t the consumer and not
vice-versa (as i s the present
position). F o r those w h o
haven't yet managed to explore
the whole of the empire, a l l
trading outlets are l i s t e d at
the end of this a r t i c l e .
y o u are 'free to sample the
wares at your l e i s u r e . B u t
w h i l s t you a r e tucking into
your meal or your drink, spare
a thought and c o n s i d e r exactly
what it i s your want from the
empire. F o r instance, do y o u
want hot s n a c k s i n the bars,
real a l e , coffee bar i n the
evening, pizza/hamburger bar,
five-course s e t lunch with
waitresses? What the U n i o n
intends to do is to conduct a
survey within the outlets to
Outlets

try to find out i f there i s a
common requirement-
for a n y
particular f a c i l i t y , or e v e n
whether the present f a c i l i t i e s
are fine but are open at the
wrong times!!
Whatever your personal
l i k e s or d i s l i k e s , have a think
about it and then l e t ' s try and
get some constructive di s-
c-ussion going a s to what i s
e x a l t required from the
exactly required from the
refecs and bars.

Another quick reminder
that the ICWA lounge is now

that the lounge is no longer
