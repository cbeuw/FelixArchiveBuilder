Guilds Union's Boanerges, a 1902 James
and Brown car, has competed in all but three
of the anual 'London to Brighton runs' for
vintage motor vehicles. On Sunday Bo' again
successfully completed the trip, but had an
unusual number of problems, resulting in a late
arrival for lunch at the Nevill House Hotel.
Bo' left Hyde Park at 8.20am amidst a deafen-
ing Boomalaka from hordes of Guilds &
L'Institut Francais supporters. Two coach-
loads of supporters later saw Bo' arrive i n
Brighton.
Despite the initially warm and sunny weather,
trouble was soon at hand. Engine overheating
caused Bo' to stop at Streatham for more water.
His (Bo's) passage was further hampered by a
surfeit of spectators who caused long delays
and traffic queues.
A mysterious lack of engine power, which
restricted the use of the two top gears, also
slowed the party down.
Our next misfortune was the weather; by
Redhill heavy rain showers (and hail) had
soaked and frozen the bedraggled crew, which
included the Rector. The latter had thought of
such eventualities, and lessened our sorrows
with a bottle of 'purified water',which looked &
tasted suspiciously like whisky. Another
helping hand came from an umbrella passed
delicately by Dave Willey's wife from her
Austin Seven to Bo'.
Another stop to check the water-level and
Bo' managed to crawl into Brighton. At this
point the engine started behaving itself and
top gear was used to take B o ' triumphantly
across the finishing line at 30mph.
The Bo' crew collected their medal, went
for lunch and met three previous Bo' drivers,
who'd arrived three hours earlier. Then came
the traditional team outing on the dodgems,
the return journey — with Bo' safely on its
trailer — and the traditional drink in the Union
Bar. We're now looking to next vear.
Bo's crew comprised of Paul Bentley (Bo'
Driver) and Dave Willey (guest co-driver).
Passengers were The Rector, Sir Brian Flowers;
Bo' Belle, Sue Winterburn and Guilds President
Steve Dearing. „ , _ ., „
