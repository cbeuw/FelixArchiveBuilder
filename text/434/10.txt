Andy's Dazzlers make
most of variety
On Wednesday the I C C C C
team led by their c a p t a i n , the
self-styled n e w Andy Davey
now wearing kit by A d i d a z z l e r
completed i n a race against
U C and L S E over U C ' s home
course at Shenly. The. two lap
course across a farm featured
a ploughed field up a steep
h i l l , which slowed/utterly
destroyed some of the runners-
A n d y , resplendant i n

T'shirt and shorts, lead" the
team of T i m , I a n , P h i l , A l a n
and Martin to the f i n i s h . T w o
nameless individuals failed tc
complete the c o u r s e . In future
non-finishers have promised to
buy the team a jug.'
Saturday's fixture — the
Priory R e l a y s at Reigate w a s
run over a long 2!4 mile c l a s s i c
course. It had plenty of variety,
Most of the course w a s over
mud/grass with a sprinkling of
h i l l . Martin Cooper, running
(he first l e g for the ' A ' team,
got over enthusiastic with i s
warming up a n d mjssed tb,e
start by some 2 minutes. H e
ran round bravely, and fortun-
ately reached the changeover
before the ' B ' team runner.
The other legs followed
smoothly; Mark S y k e s , running
in h i s usual ventilated shorts,
did well under the threat o f
'The Jug', and ran a very f a s i
4th leg for the ' B ' team.
Martin Cooper, taking h i s
second time around, then ran
the 5th l e g for the B team. H e
made up for h i s earlier mistake
by running the fastest I C C C C
time of the d a y . Unfortunately
both teams were lapped by the
eventual w i n n e r s , we a r e not
amused by nor accustomed to
such treatment.
One f i n a l s point, we hold
training s e s s i o n s on T u e s d a y s
and Thursdays at 12.30 for any
interested people. Meet at the
bottom of the union stairs by
the I C C C C noticeboard.

French fight back
The I C Water-polo team
got their first taste of
international competition this
year when they played host to
a team from M a r s e i l l e s . T h e
final score w a s M a r s e i l l e s 4
IC 2 — a creditable performance
by I C against the F r e n c h
Champions. Indeed • I C took
the early initiative and were
at one stage 2—0 i n the l e a d .
Under Pressure
The scoring was opened by
Rory L e w i s with a fine long-
range shot a n d he h a d a
second goal d i s a l l o w e d shortly
afterwards. U n f o r t u n a t e l y ,
however, I C d i d not c a p i t a l i s e
on a temporary two-man
advantage a n d towards the
end of the quarter it w a s the
IC goalkeeper, Ian B a l e s , who
was at the receiving end of the
attacks.
Quick Reply
A quick team shuffle i n the
interval brought K o s t a R i b a r
in goal to replace I a n . T h e
vacant outfield position w a s
then occupied by Dave Lowther
— Rory, C l i f f Spooner, P a u l
T h i s time it w a s C l i f f ' s turn
to penetrate the opposition's
defence. However M a r s e i l l e s
q u i c k l y replied wit h their first
goal. Then some loose marking
left a F r e n c h player free with
the ball and s o the teams
entered the second half level
at 2 - 2 .
Equaliser?
For the final two quarters
Dave Lowther was replaced by-
Ian Forrest. M a r s e
' ^ e s
took
the lead i n the third quarter
and I C again failed to take
advantage of a 'man-up'
situation. However I C came
close to scoring at the end of
the quarter — unfortunately,
the whistle went to change
sides as the ball was travelling
towards the g o a l . F i n a l l y
Marseilles rounded off .the
score from the penalty spot.
Hindle and the two McCartneys
p l a y i n g for the whole of the
game. Deapite M a r s e i l l e s
continuing to apply the
pressure, I C again produced
the first goal of the quarter.

E a r l y i n the m a t c h , Cotter
put over a penalty. A few
minutes later, Cotter, w h o
created a personal record i n
this match by actually passing
the b a l l , beat several opponents
to score a fine try, which he
then converted. Middlesex
scored a try near the end o f '
the half to make the score
9 - 4 .
Just after the restart
Williams- was carried off after
injuring h i s knee. Turley
» o v e d t o the wing, l e a v i n g
the pack w i t h 7 p l a y e r s .
Nevertheless the forwards
began t o dominate their
opposition, a n d from a s e t
scrum, scrum-half P r i c e -
Stevens made a break on the
blind side to put Gresory
through for a try.
Meanwhile, Gilbert w a s
crash tackling anything that
moved, even his own s i d e .
Heath, in h i s first match
back after injury, scored a
good try by running 50 y a r d s ,
jumping on their fullback and

Middlesex then hit back w i t h
another try. F o l l o w i n g some
great p o s s e s s i o n from the
pack, Devaney chipped ahead,
and Gregory gathered the b a l l
for h i s • second try. Cotter

With a n unbeaten run of
s i x w i n s to their credit I C
E x t r a s hoped to make it
seven. I C started strongly and
it w a s not long before R a y
P a r k i n s o n scored a try after
deft handling by b a c k s .
The second \ry came when
A l a n Armstrong gathered a
stray p a s s o n the burst and
dashed over the line, leaving
the Middlesex backs flat-footed
Soon it w a s the forwards' turn
and after c l o s e support from
the break- John F i s h b u r n

R o c k y Hobbs created and
scored the next try with a
dummy w h i c h left, the Middle-

simple try by G i b s o n (converted
by Dunleavy) brought the
half-time scored t o 24—0.
Once, over their customary
l u l l after half-time I C were
once again on the score sheet.
A perfectly judged k i c k into
space by P a t Dunleavy, left

Middlesex backs totally off
guard.
Useful scrum errors
5—yard scrums produced the
iddlesex Hospital 2nd's 0.
next two t r i e s , the first coming
when Ronnie Howard forced
the opposing sctum-half to
drop the b a l l which he then
touched down for a w e l l -
deserved try. R i c h Jenner
scored a similar try.
A penetrating run by R o d
Porter, folbpw^d by a smart
pass to J o e F o l e y , pushed the
final score to 42—0.
Repeated harassment .
Although I C lost a lot of
the set scrums, Ronnie Howard
at scrum-half continually
deprived M i d d l e s e x of p o s s e s -
s i o n by repeated harassment of
his opposite number. I C
forwards, however, dominated
the loose-rucks and mauls and
set up good s e c o n d phase
balls for the backs to use with
flair and determination (!!—ED)
These produced many break-
throughs.
I C ' s points' tally now
stand at 287 for and 39 against:
hence 42—0 i s only average.
Team:- Armstrong, Parkinson,
Block, Hobbs, Rust, Dunleavy,

Orienteering
D A M P B U T
The 'November C l a s s i c ' i n
the N e w Forest w a s a rather
damp, but nevertheless eijjoy-
able experience for those I C
Orienteers who competed. A s it
was a 'Badge E v e n t ' , most
people attempted slightly
longer courses than usual and
E N J O Y A B L E
this l e d to one or two taking
rather more than two hours to
complete their c o u r s e s .
Ian Isherwood had a good
r a c e ' a n d completed the M 2 1 B
course In 93—26, to put him
in 19th p o s i t i o n , w e l l inside
silver standard (badge) time.
On the 11 kilometre ' A ' course,
D a v i d R o s e n made s e v e r a l
small errors a n d could only
manage 5th p l a c e , three
minutes down o n the winner.
Saturday showed some
promising performances from
newcomers to the sport, and
it should not be long before
freshers start climbing into
higher echelons of the results
table.
If y o u would T i k e to try
Orienteering, come along next
Sunday (14th November). T o
reserve a p(ace i n the minibus,
come along at 12.40pm to our
F r i d a y lunchtime meeting in
the Union S C R and put your
