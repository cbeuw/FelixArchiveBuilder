letters to the editor
Dear Editor, — May I make a
few comments on the proposed
L i n s t e a d E x t e n s i o n . F i r s t l y ,
on reading last w e e k s a r t i c l e ,
the most elegant and appealing
scheme w a s c l e a r l y that of the
Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n . B e -
sides providing accommodation
which normal human beings
would enjoy l i v i n g i n , a s
opposed to the 'rabbit warrens'
which students are expected
to live i n , the scheme a l s o •
provides for extending the
present sports f a c i l i t i e s a n d
maintaining the space a v a i l a b l e
for parking.
Unfortunately the scheme
has many equally clear d i s -
advantages. T h e c o s t would
probably be prohibitive, a n d
the low r i s e aspect does not
meet with the D A P W C C ' s idea
of boxing the Gardens into
another of London's typicalf?)
squares.
Although c l e a r l y aimed at
keeping within the budget, the
C o l l e g e proposals seem t o
show a complete absence of
any new thoughts i n d e s i g n .
It appears to mirror the present
L i n s t e a d d e s i g n — with the
top chopped off to save the
expense, a n d the exterior
tarted up a bit to give i t a
newer look — and add to the
expense.
The final scheme, proposed
by Wiggins a n d Gardiner, I
feel i s totally l u d i c r o u s . H a v i n g
been privileged enough to see
their plans — w h i c h appear
to be newly incomprehensible
— I s h a l l point out my main
points o f objection.
a) T h e tennis courts a n d c a r
park are used indiscriminately
without any thought of r e p l a c -
ing these f a c i l i t i e s .
b) T h e space available
would limit the s i z e of the
courtyards, making them into
unsocial wastages of space
and only useful for accumulating
litter.
c) T h e courtyards c o u l d only
be centres o f s o c i a l activity if
warm and w e l l l i t — impossible
in the population density
suggested.
I have been unable t o see
any advantages i n their
scheme whatsoever.
One final point on the
present, and proposed density
of population: whilst high
density i s obviously, favoured
financially ( e s p e c i a l l y when
space i s limited), a density
even as high a s at present c a n
only lead to a f e e l i n g of
impersonality a n d a lack of
respect for the property. T h i s
leads directly t o v a n d a l i s m , or
at least misuse o f the available
f a c i l i t i e s , and a corresponding
reduction i n useful lifetime.
P l e a s e M e s s r s Wiggins a n d
Gardiner and whoever i s
responsible for the college
p l a n s , rethink a n d consider
the quality of life of all
Students a n d Mews residents
a l i k e .

Dear Sir, — Y o u report that
I have " e x t e n s i v e l y lobbied...
against the height of the new
building and the density o f
student n u m b e r s " .
The truth i s that I have
made argued representations
in writing, a l l of them a c c e s -
sible to Imperial C o l l e g e ,
and not against numbers —
the right number i n my opinion
i s the largest number compatible
with good environment a n d
good architecture — but
s o l e l y against the suitability
of the proposal to a l l human
inhabitants of the neighbour-
hood, whether student or
non-student. E v i d e n t l y every
councillor * w a s persuaded
that the building would
aggravate a n d reinforce the
harsh and overpowering
quality of what i s already i n
the square; destroy the light
and a i r which demolition on
Dear S i r , — There has been
much debate over the attempt
by Imperial C o l l e g e Students'
U n i o n to s e l l the N a t i o n a l
Student Discount Scheme below
the N U S recommended price
of £2.00.
We are just one o f many
small c o l l e g e s who have
invested a considerable
proportion of our total income
into the NSDS scheme. We
are attempting to increase
the income of our union by
s e l l i n g these cards and
receiving commission from
N U S for the cards that w e
s e l l . If Imperial C o l l e g e
Students' Union begin s e l l i n g
their cards cheaper than we
c a n , (If w e s e l l them at that
price it i s not worth us
s e l l i n g them), then we w i l l be
unable to s e l l our cards to
the east h a s fortuitously
created i n a potentially
dark p'.ace; a n d result in a
massive infringement of
daylighting regulations at
P h a s e Three (not given i n
your pretty picture), a n
infringement from w h i c h I C
students would p r i n c i p a l l y
suffer. My low-rise (3'/2 storey)
alternative could house more
students for your £350,000,
and could house more students
more cheaply and more q u i c k l y
in subsequent p h a s e s .
If the C o l l e g e had heeded
properly the summer meeting
of the Town P l a n n i n g
Committee, i t could have
predicted the refusal it h a s
suffered.

the students from our college
because they w i l l just go to
Imperial.
Our total investment i n the
NSDS scheme i s £500 and
we cannot afford to have un-
sold cards and handbooks,
I sincerely hope that Imperial
Union decide to forget about
this idea because it w i l l
cause severe f i n a n c i a l
difficulties to small unions
such as ours, and that they
accept that N U S h a d their
reasons, (this is only one),
in fixing the price of the
NSDS C a r d s at £2.00,

Your paper?
Dear S i r , — A s the three
students who share the
writing of F E L I X Theatre
r e v i e w s , may w e reply " to
Mr D a v e y ' s extraordinary
attack in last w e e k ' s issue?
We would not seek t o
disagree with h i s contention
that better qualified c r i t i c s
can be read i n the national
press. What we a i m to d o is to
give a students' eye view o f
productions; if we sometimes
sound pretentious then w e
apologise, it i s unintentional.
It i s unfortunate that Mr
Davey should draw comparisons
between our aspirations a n d
his Olympic q u a l i f i c a t i o n s .
We do not pretent to be
world c l a s s c r i t i c s . We are
solely reporting events a s w e
see them just a s he d o e s ,
with the difference that w e
do not digress into praise of
the beer consumed a n d t h e
public houses visited,I'm sure
you would be p l e a s e d t o
receive a report of any public
sporting o c c a s i o n w h i c h Mr
Davey has v i s i t e d , w h i c h
would be of interest to
readers, «
In conclusion may we
applaud the sentiments,
expressed in your e d i t o r i a l ,
that the tastes of F E L I X
readers cover a wide "range,
and thanks a l l those w h o
contribute to F E L I X i n any
way, particularly those w h o
cover I C events, which must
on any > >>nsideration be the
prime concern of the Newspaper
of Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n ,
