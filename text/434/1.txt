No. 434 F r i d a y , 12 November, 1976 F R E E !
Action taken on overseas
students
Measures are to be taken to create a new Union major
sub-committee (of Union Council) to cover overseas
student affairs. The move came at an informal meeting on
Wednesday evening, designed to revamp interest in the
Union's ailing Overseas Students Committee (OSC);
The meeting was convened
by A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer
P a u l Ekpenyong and E x t e r n a l
Affairs Officer Hugh Barrett,
both of whom had become
deeply concerned that the
O S C ' s nine e l e c t e d posts
were a l l vacant. T h e s e should
have been filled in M a r c h .
Low level of activity
The two were a l s o perturbed
about the absence of an
Overseas Students F r e s h e r s
reception and the low level
of activity among overseas
students o n the i s s u e s
affecting them. T h i s they
found disturbing in the wake
of increasing constraints on
overseas students studying
in the U K . 'IC is one of the
few colleges not openly
involved in fighting these
constraints and supporting
the NIJS campaign on overseas
students' said P a u l Ekpenyong.
The unanimous d e c i s i o n
to scrap the existing committee
was taken by a n invited group
of foreign students comprising
leaders of I C U ' s national
s o c i e t i e s and others interested
in promoting overseas student
a c t i v i t y . Under the plan
devised on Wednesday, these
societies would come under
the jurisdiction of the new
sub-committee,,
N
e
w proposals
The plan would e l t e c t i v e l y
fuse the aims and organisation
of the S C C national s o c i e t i e s
with those of the e x i s t i n g
Students Committee, to
produce a cohesive voice for
overseas students. The
meeting acknowledged that
the present system failed to
bind individual acnive
national societies together
on the i s s u e s common to a l l
overseas students.
The sub-committee would
be represented on C o u n c i l by
its chairman. Its composition
would be the chairmen of the
national s o c i e t i e s and e l e c t e d
representatives of overseas
students.
Executive backing
The proposals have yet to
be f i n a l i s e d and w i l l have to
be approved by U n i o n C o u n c i l
and General Meetings. Initial
Union reaction has been
favourable and i n f o r m e d
sources believe the idea w i l l
receive ascent, in p r i n c i p l e ,
at next w e e k ' s E x e c u t i v e
meeting. President N i c k
Brayshaw and S C C Chairman
A l a n Lodge have already
welcomed the p r o p o s a l s .
Action committee
An a d h o c ' O v e r s e a s
Students A c t i v i s t s Committee'
was set up at the meeting.
T h i s body w i l l decide the
exact formal structure of the
new sub-committee and present
its proposals to C o u n c i l . It i s
hoped the A c t i v i s t s Committee
w i l l a l s o instigate new
enthusiasm in o v e r s e a s
student affairs, p u b l i c i s e the
main i s s u e s affecting these
students and devise prelimin-
ary arrangements for next
year's freshers' reception.
Food prices to
stay constant
The C o l l e g e Refectory
Committee decided last week
to recommend to the Governing
Body that refectory p r i c e s
remain at their present l e v e l
after C h r i s t m a s . Suggestions
that the Committee look
deeply into what the customer
wants from the catering
s e r v i c e were welcomed by
chairman, Professor E i l o n . H e
has asked the Union to conduct
a survey to determine t h i s .

Brunei reject Izzy
I z z y , the s i x foot high fibreglass dinosaur captured by I C
students over the summer, w i l l not be returning to i t s o r i g i n a l
owners, Brunei University Students U n i o n . T h e E x e c u t i v e of
Brunei Union h a s told I z z y ' s captors that h i s U n i o n does not
intend to meet the conditions laid down for the mascot's return.
These included the payment
of £50 to the IC R a g charities
and the donation of 150 pints
of blood by Brunei students,
a l l by November 1st. T h e
mascot's captors had been
prepared to extend the dead-
l i n e , but this suggestion w a s
rejected by the Brunei
E x e c u t i v e .
Another C o l l e g e has shown
interest i n borrowing the
dinasour for their R a g pro-
c e s s i o n and negotiations are
now underway to sort out the
d e t a i l s .
T h e s e developments weren't
the only mascotry a c t i v i t i e s
in the last week. R C S Union
tried u n s u c c e s s f u l l y to steal
Spanner and B o l t , the G u i l d s
mascots, at last T h u r s d a y ' s
E l e c t r i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g
F r e s h e r s ' Dinner. R C S U
sealed a l l the entrances to
the C o l l e g e forcing G u i l d s to
keep their mascots o n the
campus until the R C S U groups
groups had d i s p e r s e d . Spanner
and Bolt finally left C o l l e g e
via the C h e m i c a l Engineering
building at about 10.20pm.
No trouble was reported.
Another mascot, P h i n e a s ,
