In suffering the first
league defeat this season,
IC played their best hockey
this term, although two
defensive errors cost them
the match. E t t e s s a , who
have scored on average five
goals per game in the League,
started the match as this
form suggests, showing
sharpness in attack. After
ten minutes they were given
a penalty which was e a s i l y
converted. At this point IC
woke up and started
contensting the control of
midfield and beginning to
put pressure on the E t t e s s a
defence. Towards the end
of the half, IC were awarded
a penalty from which Kim
Houlden scored. After the
break IC played some very
impressive hockey, taking
the lead through an excellent
goal by Mike Isles. At this
by Jim Marshall
point IC were w e l l on top
and had complete control
of the game. Unfortunately
two 'gift' goals In the space
of two minutes completely
destroyed IC's superiority
and rhythm, putting E t t e s s a
in comand of the game
though not by any great
s k i l l on their part. To rub
salt into the wounds, the
umpire allowed a fourth
goal to count, after the
whistle had been blown for
an offence. T h i s completed
the unrepresentive score
line In a game which IC
at least deserved a draw,
having two goals d i s s a l l o w e d
by their umpire.

The A ' s turned out full
of confidence and looking
forward to a good game. That
kick-off was arranged for
11 o ' c l o c k (with Twickenham
in mind) but by that time
B e l s i z e Park had ten men
only on the field and were
expected no more than
another two. A s the referee
for the E x t r a ' s game had
failed to turn up it was
decided that the remaining
fourteen should take on the
twelve from B e l s i z e Park.
A s soon as that was settled
interest in the game waned.
There was no real
concentration at any time
during the game and the
play was very scrappy. IC
were winning so much ball
that people were falling
over each other in an attempt
to score. When half-time
arrived IC were only 12 — 6
in the lead, having let
B e l s i z e Park in for a try
which they converted.
The second half was a
bit better. AI Harery ran
in the second o f his usual
two tries, and Hugh Duncan
scored his second try of the
season and that was con-
verted. Jon Pitcher, preserving
his energy for this week's
game, ran in the last try to
complete his hat-trick — the
highlight of the afternoon.
(He thought differently about
it later when he was pushed
up the stairs to the bar to buy
a jug.).
In the end IC ran out easy
winners by seven tries and
one conversion (30 points)
to one converted try (6
points). It was a game best
forgotten. And how long are
we going to persevere with
fixtures against B e l s i z e
Park (II) who have no failed
to turn up with anything
like a full team on three
occasions during the last
two years?
Next week the A ' s w i l l
have to play a lot better,
as of course they are capable,
if they are going to put
the same score past
University C o l l e g e (III).

Belsize Park (II): 6
After an uneventful
journey, four separate groups
of runners met at Wye
C o l l e g e , to form a running
team of nine, plus a wide
range of assorted a c c e s s o r i e s ,
who had come " u n d e r the
thumb" or just for something
to do. We ran against three
16ths of the Wye team,
including the latest anti-
E l l i s weapon.
The race progressed up
and down the
slope of the Wye College
mountain (1600ft, 900ft,
400ft, 150ft ?), for about four
miles or five and a half
miles depending on who was
asked. While certain members
slogged up and down these
virtical slopes, the a c c e s s o r i e s
were having a guided tour
of the C o l l e g e , and arrived
back just in time to see
Ian E l l i s sprinting in,
against virtually non-existant
opposition from the anti-
E l l i s weapon ( " w e l l , Iran
6 miles last night, and
6 miles this morning, so
I didn't bother").
After these two, there
were six consecutive IC
runners, including an excellent
run by " I ' m only here for
the t r a i n i n g " "Isherwood,
who has apparently been
off the beer recently. Then
followed a four minute gap
before the final four runners
arrived — during this time
Mr Davy seemed to reacquire
his taste for beer, which he
lost on that fateful Monday
night a couple of weeks
ago. The final result was
that only the third team
was beaten by Wye, thanks
to a fine run by one of the
imports, who came in during
a short period after the
race was thought to have
finished.
The race was followed
by the annual procession
of masochists from the
village to a point miles up
in the dark, w h e r e a big fire
was burning. There were
added hazards to this
excursion, due to various
undersized juvenile fire-
rishs who seemed to enjoy
waving flaming
around the procession.
The previous Wednesday,
again, with a much depleted
team, we visted the non-
event of the University
College, 150th Aniversary
Celebrations. We came
second in the relay which
was organised, but s i n c e so
few people went, there seems
to be little or no information
on what happened. In fact,
did an IC team really enter
this race?
Football
On Saturday 25th October,
Oxford resounded to Welsh
accents and cries of " N i c e ,
i n n i t ? " as J i m I ley's Red
Army descended upon the
unsuspecting c i t y . We were
there to play our annual
fixtures against three privileged
colleges. The second XI
played St J o h n ' s College and
lost 6 - 1 . The third XI beat
Hertford C o l l e g e 3 — 2 and
were our only s u c c e s s , as the
F i r s t s lost to St Edmund's
H a l l , 4 - 2. T h i s was a
rather ill-tempered 'friendly'
(not our " fault, of course),
the first half of which was
conducted under police
s u r v e i l l a n c e . After the
game the F i r s t s went back to
St Edmund's to make friends
with the opposition, and
watched " D o c t o r W h o " on the
College television (high spot
of the day for some, wasn't
it Terry?).
The three teams met up
again in Oxford that evening
to commence the serious
business of drinking. H a v i n g
tried two pubs we eventually
settled in the Red L i o n ,
where we commandeered about
fifty per cent of the saloon,
and ignoring requests to
" t u r n it d o w n " etc, sat
round drinking and s i n g i n g .
Somehow we a l l got back to
coach; thirty-odd steaming
shapes in good voice and
looking forward to the
Cambridge trip next term.

Imperial Mixed 1st 2
Bedford 1st 7
In this the toughest
fixture of the year, Imperial
did well to take even in two
games. Helped by Bedford
who had to play a normal
substitute man but hindered
by the absence of their
captain R Hopton, many games
were c l o s e enough to almost
make a difference to the
score. S t i l l the games were
played in a friendly, and
jovial atmosphere even when
the Stackridge roadies began
moving their equipment
into the Great H a l l .
Bedford, having 5 or 6
players in the U L U team
were deserved winners and
will undoubtedly remain
unbeaten t h r o u g h t the
remainder of the s e a s o n .
