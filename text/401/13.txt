Lord Mayor's
Show 75

The Lord Mayor's Show
1975 w a s quite s u c c e s s f u l
despite a few mishaps during
the d a y . However, these d i d
not mar a throughly enjoyable
occasion in which one of
the major land marks was
Boanerges' survival throughout
the day with absolutely no
need for attention. She even
achieved 'fame' by appearing
on television!
Unfortunately G u i l d s , who
usually manage to shine on
this occasion, were unable to
enter a float this year. They did
not have any materials to build
a float and being unable
to beg or borrow a lorry, d i d
without one.
On the other hand, they
nearly put a spanner in the
works with a fourteen feet
long wooden replica of the
real 'spanner'. A l s o present
were the hordes that represented
Kings C o l l e g e and the C i t y
University both of whom
together with G u i l d s are
invited to join the procession
each year because of their
c l o s e ties with the City of
London.
There were many bands in
the procession including the
Drums and P i p e s of London
Irish rifles!
If singing and marching
were not enough to keep people
warm, then whisky certainly
was — at least a bottle of
this burning liquid w a s reported
doing the ranks of the B l u e s
and Royals - the horse even
got a s i p ! ? !
Although the flatfoots
were out In force, many
souvenirs were collected
en route and everyone retired
at the end of the procession
for a well earned rest.
