Bee Gees: Main Course (RSO)
The album includes the hit single
'Jive Talkin' which has proved to be
just about the best thing the group has
done. However, the album kick-offs with
their latest single 'Nights on Broadway'
which has not yet Droken into MM's
singles Chart but is climbing through the
US singles chart. I would say that this
track was far superior to the former
although not quite In the same d i s c o
c l a s s i c c l a s s .
S t i l l , on with the album, 'Wind of
Chance' is a very pleasant track s t i l l
carrying the overtones of funk which
underlay most of the album with the
exception of Songbird' which is a
typical top of the pops average smoochy.
The most beautiful, pleasant and
contemporary song on the album is
'Fanny (be tender with my love)'. It
is m u s i c a l l y the most developed. It
employs an exhilarating mixture of
vocals from within the group which is
well executed.
After d i s m i s s i n g the first track on
side two — It probably went to their
heads with a title like 'All This Making
L o v e ' ! - the rest of this side can be
FELIX
described as quite good. 'Country
L a n e s ' takes one back to when they
had 'Massuchusetts' as a hit single
and It Is surprising that with variation
in arrangement the fundamental sound
has not aged very much.
In fact after the first sidethey
completely shake off the funky side
previously prevalent and s l i d e into
their more conventional style although
they have Improved tremendously In this
sphere. Certainly if I had to recommend
any of the above three albums, I
would reccommend this one as the
best value overall. Indeed, it is quite
different experience of the Bee Gees
at possibly their best.
Faith Hope & Charity: Faith Hope &
Charity (RCA)
'Let's Go to the Disco' where the
music is out of sight sing this trio of
two females and one male and by some
strange coincidence he is Hope. Well,
I only got as far as my room to listen
to this album which is produced, arranged
and conducted by Van ' H u s t l e ' M c C o y .
It's certainly full of good things but
suffers from chronic superficiality and
commercialism. The tracks worthy of
note are the first two on side one v i z ;
'Let's Go to the Disco' 'Just One Look'
'Disco Dan and 'To Each His Own' are
a l s o quite good e s p e c i a l l y the latter
which is currently making it at the
number one spot in the US soul top 20.
However, this is not surprising since
McCoy uses a re-hasfted version of
the ' H u s t l e ' arrangement in it. Certainly
the Hustle rythms are most noticeable
throughout but on ' T o Each His Own'
the temptation proves to be too much.
This album is unlikely to make it in
Britain although some of the tracks
if released as singles stand a very
good chance and in this category one
would include 'Mellow Me' an exciting
song with good use of the vocal t a l e n t
of the group — they definitely do not
lack in this field. Definitely an easy
listening album but useful at parties to
give the D J a rest!
