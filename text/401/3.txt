The Girl Next Door
P R O F I L E : Cynthia Rogers,
C y n t h i a Rogers
C Y N T H I A R O G E R S is the
kind of girl we a l l w i s h lived
next door during our c h i l d -
hood: v i v a c i o u s , fun to be
with, always with a w i l l i n g
ear and an almost t i t i l l a t i n g
sparkle in her eyes. She is
this year's Coordinator of
Nightline, the confidential
organisation which is run by
students from a l l over London
for students who are in
trouble, lonely, board, fed up
or just finding it difficult to
cope with things. Running
Nightline ;s a full-time job
and the post therefore carries
r a sabbatical year. The work is
not easy, but she enjoys the
immense satisfaction which
the job gives her because she
gets to meet " . . . l o t s of
interesting people: not only
the c a l l e r s , but the Nightliners
whom I work with and the
Student Unions in the London
area which I have to approach
to get them involved in
N i g h t l i n e " . •
Cynthia i s twenty-two,
unattached, c o m e s from
Boreham Wood in Hertfordshire,
got her B S c in Nutrition from
Queen E l i z a b e t h C o l l e g e ,
London, in June 1974 and
instinctively jumps at the
sound of a telephone. Before
becoming the Nightline C o -
ordinator she spent a year at
Garnett Teacher Training
C o l l e g e .
She speaks genuinely and
sincerely and avoids using
tones more suited to either
a confessional or a passionate
crusade. There is no feeling
of exaggerated friendliness
run amok to the point of
gullibility or dogmatic fervour
ranting up its own orifice. But
so much e a s i l y recognisable
than definable and definitely
warrants more • than, a quick

honesty, dedication, patience,
understanding and mischievous
gorgeousness.
The origins of N i g h t l l n e g o
back to 1971 when it was felt
that the C o l l e g e ' s student
suicide rate was becoming a
major cause for concern.
Stories of students jumping
out of Southside, leaping off
Queen's Tower and taking
poison were fast becoming a
a moribund folklore. A s i m i l a r
scheme w a s * being run by
students at E s s e x University,
so Imperial College was quick
to realise the potential behind
the idea of providing premises
in P r i n c e ' s Gardens with an
external telephone. Whilst I C ' s
was only the second Nightline
to be set up, today s i m i l a r
. schemes are run by students
at nearly a l l the colleges,
universities and polytechnics
throughout the country; but it
is only in the London area that
a sabbatical is provided by a l l
the c o l l e g e s actually sub-
scribing to the scheme. T h i s
was considered necessary
because s o many previous
Coordinators had failed their
exams due to their Nightline
committment.
H o w many N i g h t l i n e
volunteers do you have helping
you? " A b o u t sixty-five
students drawn from a l l over
L o n d o n . "
How many calls do you get per
night? " O n average, about
three a n i g h t . "
Do you ever get any abusive
callers? " R a r e l y . "
Do you ever have any hoaz
callers? " N e v e r . "
How much money do you
receive to cover the costs of
running Nightline? " I t is run
on a shoe-string budget."
found ourselves last Tuesday
evening during ICWA's second
debate, a Balloon debate.
The first round of the
debate Involved slandering
everyone e l s e on the platform
and projecting one's own role
as vital to IC.
R i z saw himself a s being
most essential to Union
members because — well let's
face It — h e ' s got the keys to
the Union B u i l d i n g . Very few
people were impressed by that
line of argument, hence R i z
was first to be ejected from the
balloon.
Ian saw h i s job as one of
helping people whether in
How does one become a Night-
line volunteer? " F i r s t off they
have to contact u s . We then
have a chat to them to try and
determine whether the person's
motive for becoming a Nlght-
llner seems reasonable. T h e
person then has to be trained
to cope with the multitude of
different situations which can
arise during an evening at
N i g h t l i n e . "
What qualities do you look tor
in a potential Nlghtliner? "They
have to be easy to talk to.
Generally they are people who
are not preoccupied with
taking soup to the vagrants of
Charing C r o s s or supervising
adventure playgrounds. Y e s ,
we thought, very nice too -
but what about helping IC
students? Thus Ian q u i c k l y
followed R i z to an untimely
'death'.
That left N i c k and myself,
both of us having convinced
those present during the first
two rounds of our worthwhile
contribution to the quality of
life. In the final round I was
called on to speak first and
warmeo to my task by numerous
glasses of sherry, I portrayed
my job of being one which had
massive Implication for the
whole of humanity. It was a
pity nobody e l s e thought so as
I too went tumbling out of the
balloon leaving Nick Brayshaw
as the balloon's affable and
deserving captain.
The debate was lively, good
humoured and witty (even If,
thanks to John Downs, most of

I understand.

Nightline, for whatever reason,
should go along to 8 Prince's
Gardens, or phone Int. 2468 or
GPO 581 2468 between 6pm
and 9am.''
