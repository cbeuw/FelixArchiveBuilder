Heroine foils City raid
Last Friday five 'heavies'
from the City University made
an unsuccessful bid to relieve
the Royal School of Mines
of their mascot Davy. How-
ever, the unlucky raiders
were not only thwarted in
their attempt, but were in
fact trying to make-off with
the defnnct mascot which had
been left in the window
of the Mines Union office.
It was this exhibitionism
which the City raiders thought
to tame. t
Tbe saga began at about
5.00pm in the evening when
a non descript student
arrived in the RSMU office
to enquire if there were any
Rag Mags for sale.
Martyn 'Norma' Levy who
was holding the fort, the
Mines brain cell and a
Flash Gordon comic at the
time, then sold a Rag Mag
to the student. Having
the transaction, the student
asked if the Davy on display
was heavy and was
rewarded with a positve
reply (after all, it is full
of concrete!)
The student left only to
return five minutes later,
this time accompanied by
four others and asked for
more Rag Mags. As Norma
turned to find the Rag Mags,
he was pounced on by two
of the group whilst the
other three made off with
Davy.
Norma being an experienced
voyeur reacted quickly to
the situation. He smacked
one of the raiders in the
teeth and broke free from
his boundage. He then
rushed out of the office
and immediately came face
to face with another one of
the five raiders. Without
batting an eyelid, he sank
the raider with a 17% degree
Arkwright â€” the raider didn't
bat an eyelid either.
In two bounds he had
caught up with the self-
appointed Davy bearers,
deftly throttled one and
checked the others' bags
with his mining boot. Thus
the attempt to steal the
Mines ex-mascot was foiled.
