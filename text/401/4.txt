4 FELIX
NUS Women's Conference
Political diatribe and lesbianism
At s i x o'clock on Saturday
morning, before the rest of IC
had recovered from Friday
night, two brave delegates
set off for Bristol to attend
the N U S Women's Conference.
T h i s was part of the N U S
women's campaign which was
set up In 1972 to promote
both the awareness of women's
issues amongst the student
body, and hopefully provide
some solutions to problems
raised by these Issues.
The conference, which was
packed, was opened by Maria
Loftus, the guest speaker
from Islington Trades' C o u n c i l ,
speaking on how the Trades
Unions and the N U S could
further the women's campaign.
This speech was largely
irrelevant since it considered
only the case of the T U C and
women workers. It seemed
far removed from any aspects
of student life, and the speaker
did little to tie In the experience
of the T U C with that of the
NUS. In common with many
politicians she also spoke for
longer than was necessary.
These ideas d i d not really
come into the conference
again. In fact the rest of the
time revolved around two
themes: the problems that '
women had setting up closed
groups, because under the N U S ,
a financed group is not allowed
to be c l o s e d , and the foundation
of the Network. T h i s was
started in order to combine
all the women's groups in
colleges t h r o u g h o u t the
country so that they work towards
a common ideal.
The first of these ideas was
brought out very strongly
in one of the workshops
we attended on 'Setting up a
women's campaign in a small
college'. Many women felt
that they could not run . an
effective women's group with
men present. T h i s was a
rationale that we did not
really understand s i n c e Ideas
cannot be changed unless
everybody is educated. B e s i d e s
which very few men I know
would enjoy sitting listening
to 20 women d i s c u s s their
problems for 2 hours. A
common e x p e r i e n c e was
that women's groups were most
effective when tied to s o c i a l
a c t i v i t i e s , which made me
think that perhaps ICWA is
the perfect solution; an
established body bringing
wornens issues to the fore!
After lunch, the session
began with a talk on N A C ,
which raised the same points
as the conference held in
college a few weeks ago.
These have already been
fully reported In F E L I X .
There was then an attempt
by the lesbians present, to
throw the men out, which
resulted in uproar (a common
state during the conference)
and 9 0 % of the people there
voting against them. The
resolutions were then debated.
These brought out vividly the
two themes of the conference
and In fact veiws were split
almost in half. The motions
covered the network, the issues
women face and the d i v i s i v e
nature of autonomous women's
groups.

everyone adjourned to the

later to finish off what was

The response to the Idea
was very encouraging and we

who helped make the evening
a s u c c e s s .

M E D I T A T I O N (TM) was
brought to the West 16 years
ago by Maharishi Mehesh Y o g i .
It is a simple technique
of deep meditation which is
practiced for 15/20 minutes
twice a day sitting comfortably
with the eyes c l o s e d .
A s opposed to other
methods of meditation or
self development, it does
not require any concentration
or contemplation, belief,
faith, changes of diet,
standing on the head or
any change in one's life
style.
â€¢ Over the last 5 years, there
has been a great deal of
interest in the technique
among research s c i e n t i s t s .
Over 300 experiments have
been published to date,
which indicate that during
TM a deep state of integrated
rest is achieved. A t the
same time, brainwave activity,
as measured by E E G (electro-
encephalograph), become more
orderly. Research findings
after mediation show a
greater coordination between
body and mind, improved
health, improved s o c i a l
relations and an increase
in learning ability and
academic performance.
The t r a n s c e n d e n t a l
Meditation technique can be
learnt in seven easy steps,
the first of which is coming
to an Introductory T a l k
held by Soc every Thursday
at 1.15pm in Room 407A
in the E l e c E n g department.
There are a l s o regular
meetings for members o f T M
Soc every Tuesday at 5.45pm.
Any enquiries should be

Here beginneth another
advice-laden missive from
W E L L S O C , this time reporting
on our meeting on Monday
10th November. We would
have liked to have printed
a full transcription of Dr
Shaw's informative lecture,
but they wouldn't let u s .
(And the editor of this
learned journal wouldn't
approve either.) But to help
you, I w i l l tell you a s much
as I think I can get away
with.
If you want to go into
crime, you have a reason.
(If you don't, you're a
psychopath.) These reasons
are either fame or fortune.
If you want fame, not getting
found out is a bit awkward,
as AI Capone could teli
you. But In truth, most of
us want the fortune side
of crime, and with this Dr
Shaw, professional scientist
and amateur criminal, w i l l
be able to help u s . Dr
Shaw gave us some definitions.
A professional is a person
who professes to doing a
job (in the literal sense),
while an amateur is someone
who loves doing something,
if you define the word from
the Latin root. Thus, a l l
criminals in the fortune
group are amateurs. Q . E . D .
Now what branch of
crime do you want to go into?
According to the Home
Office list (they're very
obliging, are the Home Office)
there are 107 to chose from,
but there are only really
three main popular types,
namely Loot, Sex and drugs,
and Sudden death. E v e n
these three are subjects to
occupy a lifetime of study,
so only the first subject,
Loot, was covered in any

with many small colleges we
felt that areas should have
delegate status. T h i s w a s
narrowly defeated (after 3
recounts!) when It came to a
vote. We a l s o voted against
autonomous women's groups
feeling that it was an
impractical and patronising
view, e s p e c i a l l y in this
College!
The business got through
in the afternoon w a s con-
tinually being Interupted
by the militant lesbians who
challenged everything that
was said and sung loudly
through many peoples speeches.
Feelings at the conference
were very > strongly against
them, and for u s , at least,
their a c t i v i t i e s proved s o
boring we were on the point
of walking out. Our overall
impressions on leaving the
conference were ones of
dlsatlsfaction at the rudeness
of many people present and
the Irrelevance of much that
was s a i d .
The main argument concerning
the network was whether
people sent from area groups
should have delegate or
observer status. T h i s may
seem a petty point, _but In
fact Involves the question
of small colleges who cannot
afford to send delegates to
a conference, and therefore
must be represented by their
areas. The points against
this were that areas are not
working effectively at present
and that areas should pay for
small col leges to send delegates.
Coming from a part of London
depth. We are very lucky
at IC if we are interested
in this section, as not a
hundred yards from here is
a rather superb national
art c o l l e c t i o n , the V & A .
According to Dr Shaw, the
thing to go for are the
Chinese brass items, of
which he considerately
showed us photographs. He
declined to be more specific
about things like security
guard rounds, which was a
pity. Now If any of you have
shares in Nat West, s e l l
them. Although I didn't quite
understand the d e t a i l s , but
our speaker has a very good
method for extracting money
from the bank's computer.
I w i s h I could tell you
more, but I have to go now.
Don't forget the film next
week: Phase 4 is coming!
A l l right, officer, I'll come
quietly.
