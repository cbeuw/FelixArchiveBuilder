Essay C o m p e t i t i o n o n F r u i t Juices
The Eighth International Fruit Juice Congress will take
place in Merano, Northern Italy, from May 17 to 22, 1976.
In order to stimulate interest in the Congress and in the
field of fruit juices, the organising committee of the
International Fruit Congress invites students of departments
of food science or similar departments of universities,
technical colleges and polytechnics to participate in an
essay competition. Papers submitted must deal with one or
more aspects of fruit juices (eg chemistry, technology,
economics, nutrition, legal aspects etc), may not be longer
than 6,000 words and must be typed in one of the Congress
languages (English, French, Italian or German) on one side
of the page only, using double spacing and having a wide
margin at the sides. The jury is composed of members
of the Scientific-Technical Commission of th e International
international Federation of Fruit Juice Producers and Its
decisions are final. The six best papers will be published
in the Congress Proceedings. The authors of the three best
papers will be invited to attend the Congress.
Participants resident in Great Britain, who must be
younger than 25 on May 1, 1976. are invited to send their
papers to Dr I- Vi Heech, Research Station, Long Ashton,
Bristol, BS18 9 A F , before January 15, 1976. Successful
candidates will be notified individually before March 1, 1976.

Refectories
"Speciality of the house: vast piles of grey, mushy
chips". That is the opinion of the Sennet reporter, John
Ryan, when he visited the refectories at IC." In fact, in
the survey which covered four other colleges and U L U ,
we come out bottom of the list.
It is for this very reason that the refectories are suffering
from a decrease in turnover thus making it almost certain
that there will be a further increase in refectory prices at
Christmas. Or will the College take the drastic step of
closing one of the refectories? If so which one? The Union
Lower Refectory?
There has been a lot of talk, most of it sensible, if
somewhat impracticable, on the ways we might try to
solve the refectories problem. One snch idea, was put
forward by Mr Williams (see F E L I X no. 399). I agree that
if there existed an air of mutual co-operation between the
opposing factions then we would have a basis for progress.
I. further agree that the Union, in the person of Mr Teague
appears to be defeatist in its attitude to the problem.
However, I would contend that Mr Teague and other leaders
of this Union enjoy grass-roots support. Where were the
grass-roots at the first UGM of this session when the
refectories problem was being discussed?
I feel that a solution to this problem would be for the
Union to take over the running of the Union refectory.
It could then employ an outside catering concern to run it
and charge prices that would compete with Mr Mooney's
prices. This would thus break the monopoly that Mr Mooney
has on the catering in this College.
I look forward to seeing some reaction to this idea.
Halls of Residence
Mr Te.ague in his 'Peter Patter' last week asked for
some reaction to bis comments on refectories and halls of
residence cleaning. I am glad to see that there has been
some response (see latters to the editor, page 6), albeit
only a meagre one. Although I would lend my support to
the suggestions put forward by our two correspondants
this week, the matter is not so easily resolved. The
suggestion that we cut down on cleaning would mean' a
reduction in cleaning staff and as far as I am aware the
other Union involved, N U P E , has not been consulted as
yet regarding this. But this does not detract from the fact
that students in halls of residence get it too damn good.
