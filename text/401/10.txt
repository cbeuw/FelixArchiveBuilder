Reviews Concerts
Stackridge and Sparrow in the Great
Hall
After the Lord Mayor's Show comes
...Stackridge.
Bid adieu to the Stackridge of old.
Last Saturday's gig in the Great H a l l
saw a mish-mash of the old and the new.
The saying " Y o u can't teach an old dog
new t r i c k s " sprang to my mind halfway
through their set — it seemed appropriate
at the time. A l l this was a pity, as the
support band, a chirpy little outfit called
" S p a r r o w " , had done enough to set the
scene for a really astral (one up on
cosmic) concert.
Sparrow are a useful five man band
who are obviously never going to make it
big, but w i l l aiways go down well in
clubs or as support a c t s . Their act is a
little too polished, and they had an
annoying habit of a l l going " d o o - w a h "
at the end of a number-ugh! M u s i c a l l y
they showed tremendous versatility —
the lead guitarist can " r e a l l y lay down
some mean tracks, m a n " (from the row
behind me).
They sound like an up-dated Barron
Knights - what do you mean, who's
Barron Knights? They did sing some of
their own compositions a n d one c a l l e d
" O D o c t o r " , which is out now and
" b u d d l i n g in the 2 0 0 ' s " , was very
enjoyable.
One of the highlights of the evening
was their rendition of some Beach Boys
melodies which they did with marvelous
harmonisation. They ended the set with a
medley of " o l d i e s but g o o d i e s " which
had a stomping f i n i s h . T n i s had the
audience clamouring for more and so we
had an encore! " G r e a t " , I thought.
Obviously the band were either under
orders to get off quick and stop hogging
the limelight, or they only new one other
song, either way it was unfortunate that
we were subjected to a truly nauseating
piece dating from those sugary days of
the all-American kid c a l l e d " G r a d u a t i o n
D a y " . T h i s is definitely not one for
listening to - to quote the lady(?) on my
right, " I t ' s the Mike Summers S i n g e r s " .
Nonetheless, a good set from Sparrow.
And so the S t a c k r i d g e " . Having done
my best to get high on Swan lager
(Australian goats piddle), I sat back,
girdled my loins, and waited to be
zonked out.
The Band, overall, were too loud,
and seemed to fall into the trap w h i c h
so many " b i g " bands do. The assumption
that everyone in the audience knows the
words to the songs and that, therefore,
we do not have to hear them at the
concert. T h i s is i n v a l i d , e s p e c i a l l y
in a time of high inflation — that Is,
when records are bloody expensive. We
could hear everyword of Sparrow's set.
Not so with Stackridge.
Beyond this general comment, their
old songs, light-hearted " s o f t " rock,
were great. " F i s h in a G l a s s " featured
some lovely sax playing while " G o o d
L o o k i n g " had most people tapping
their feet lightly on the floor. Their
musical pieces were interesting —
not being v o c a l , one did not have to
try and pick up the words.
" S l a t e r ' s W a l t z " began with a quiet
piano solo, then gradually in came sax,
guitar and mellotron. A l l in a l l , quite
breathtaking. On the other hand,
" C o n i s t o n Water", in which we were
asked to v i s u a l i s e " t h e waves lapping
on the s h o r e " , the trees in the w i n d " ,
and a tramp having * * • * , was a failure.
Pink F l o y d play this sort of stuff
some what better, and borrowing some
of t h e - r i f t s from C r i m s o n ' s " " L i z a r d "
did not 'exactly endear itself- to yours
truly. The encore was- a rousiifg version
of " Y o u r Mother Should K n o w " . More
like it would have been appreciated.
On the whole then, Sparrow played
well — Stackridge were also present.
Records
Bruce Springsteen - "Born to Run" (C
Before putting record to turntable,
Bruce Springsteen was just an American
songsmith to me who, by a l l accounts, had
the prospect of a big future as the re-
v i t a l i s e d s u c c e s s o r to D y l a n . He was
signed to C B S by John Hammond who
introduced such artists as B i l l i e Holiday
Bob D y l a n , and Aretha Franklin to the
music public, so if past experience and
present expenditure on the promotion of
Springsteen is anything to go by, great
things are expected in the next few years.
Once, in the grooves, the initial impact
are the raspy vocals - a mixture of Roger
Chapman, Joe Cocker and at times Lee
Marvin; if a sufficiently-efficient groin-
squeezer could be produced. The opening
track, " Thunder road" resembles the
early ' L i t t l e Feat' product — simple
trucking music with primitive beat and
.light, Tonky piano - No f r i l l s . It's
quickly apparent that whatever strength
the songs have lies in the lyrics rather
than the music, which remains relatively
pedestrian throughout the album apart
from the occasional sax or piano filler.
The lyrics on the other hand, much in the
Dylan mould, are strong and well-balanced
to carry across the intended punk/street
life ambience with maximum clarity and
force.
At first there seems strong evidence
to suggest that Roy Bittan is the first fully
programmable keyboards player, so
monotonous is his contribution for the
bulk of the record, but life seems evident
when he very o c c a s s i o n a l ly steps outside
the beat. Indeed the best moments are
consistently the first few bars of each
track, where some scope is provided for
invention before the all-consuming beat
moves in to render inactive any possible
finesse that might germinate.
"Blackstreets" already V» into side
1, provides the first punch of the album,
with lines spat rather than sung, and a
pianist who finally starts to play. T h i s is
followed, on side 2, by the title-track and
current single but remains the same old
story - good l y r i c s , mediocre m u s i c . The
first taste to appear does so painfully late
on "Meeting across the river", where a
softer, more complete song, filled with
imaginative musicianship emerges,
carried along on a wave of piano and
guitar. For superior quality than the
rantings of previous numbers ."Jungle-
land", the closer, is also impressive —
fine lyrics wejdad to a substantial rocker
providing the best sax solo of the set.
"Born to run" is an album of evocative,
pungent lyrics set to unexceptional music
by an artist tipped to be one of C B S ' s
major moneyspinners. For those who
want to crown a new D y l a n , be it on their
own heads, because e s s e n t i a l l y Bruce
Springsteen is a product of their making.
Climax Blues Band: Stamp Album (BTM)
There is always a difference between
groups who play and sing their own
songs and those who are just vocal
groups like F a i t h Hope and C h a r i t y .
The Climax B l u e s Band have blended
together a good and e x c i t i n g new
sound which can only be described
as soul-rock.
The guitar work on the first track,
'Using the power', on side one of this
album is as good as some I've heard
on what is usually described as hard-
rock records.
The album is full of good s o l i d
rythms and this is more than reflected
in the second track, 'Mr Goodtime'.
T h i s track shows the group at
their most innovative — a completely
new sound In soul which extends and
amplifies the use of instrumentation
and the basic vocals/rythm combination
of this genre. Their music seems to
be drawn from a l l the best s c h o o l s of
jazz, rock, blues, sould and r o c k ' n ' r o l l
The jazzy type rock is expressed In
'/ am Constant' which t a i l s off
beautifully in a kind of ragtime blues
sound.
For sheer delightful funk, however,
one has to listen to 'Running out of
time'.
The second track on side two 'Rusty
Nail/The Devil Knows' is aptly named -
being toned down with an introduction
of soul rythms. The next track, ' L o o s e n -
up', bears absolutely no resemblance to
the other songs on the album. It sounds
more like a rag-time blues number
that's been stripped of its b a s i c soul
o r i g i n s .
'Spirit Returning' is more reminiscent
of the recent soft soul era that seems to
have faded for the moment. T h i s track
has somewhat more depth and should
catch on In d i s c o s If anyone ever
cares to play It.
On the whole the second s i d e is
a disappointment after the first side
In which the group really e x c e l l e d . The
noticeable thing about the album is
the way In which the music revolves
round the instruments which are w e l l
played. It is almost as If they are
speaking out the music.
