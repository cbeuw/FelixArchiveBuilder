T h e F u t u r e
Sir, — Friday evening should
have been restful, but then I
read L o r d R o t h s c h i l d ' s
speech in F E L I X 4 0 0 !
The kindest descriptions
of it would be " s i l l y " , or
" c h i l d i s h " , or perhaps
" n a i v e " . But c a n one apply
such terms, without censure,
to the public pronouncements
of s o important a figure in our
establishment? I think not.
For it Is troubling to suspect
such limited awareness in a
man Of influence. L e t me
summarise my reactions.
" T h e F u t u r e " (title of
the speech) i s a matter not
just of interest, a s it has
always been, but of profound
and fundamental concern on
the part of a great many
people. T h e prospects for
humanity, or indeed the
biosphere, seem bleak indeed,
and a speech which failed to
inject humour or compassion
into the subject might at
least have afforded it a more
s e r i o u s a n d m a t u r e
consideration. A s it was we
were presented with various
technocratic oddments, real
imagined, such as " e x t a s i n " ,
a pleasure drug, or (another
travesty of a serious matter)
a dabble J n the implications
of genetic engineering.
The major " f o c u s " seemed
to be population growth. While
I am no great expert on this
subject, I d i d participate In the
World Population Conference
in Bucharest last year, and
i n s e v e r a l p r e c e d i n g
conferences on population,
and I would at least c l a i m to
be familiar with the works of
experts in this field, as w e l l
as with the feelings of
a c t i v i s t s in organisations
concerned with population
phenomena in Britain and
abroad. From this viewpoint,
Lord R o t h s c h i l d ' s words
seem nothing short of c r a s s .
Producing and caring for
children i s a most intimate
and precious part of human
life, and the problems of
growth and distribution of the
total population is not helped
or clarified by dehumanising
it through absurd and emotive
extrapolations of growth rates.

In fact I would assert that the
" n u m b e r s " approach is
bankrupt, both morally and as
a . help in defining what Is
meant by a population problem,
or even " t h e " population
problem.
The rest of my reactions
form a rag-bag of a set that
seems finite but unbounded:
the specious beginning —
"The most important members
of this audience have only
recently started their adult
lives"; the pompous vacuity
— eg "...the H-bomb, which,
incidentally, I predict will
not intentionally be used in
your lifetime" - w h e w ! ,
thanks Lord R, and to think
S'd been worrying about it a l l
this time!; and so it goes on —
these extracts are just from
the first two paragraphs.
May I finish on the good
L o r d ' s level, by speculating
that h e ' d taken a drug which
he forgot to mention: " N o n s i n " ,
the effects of which are
revealed by the speech. The
question Is, should it be
banned?
Yours sincerely,
J O H N S H A D E ,

Sir, — A number of people
seem to entertain the idea
that a solution to the wo-id's
population problem lies in the
export of people to somewhere
off this planet.
I w a s very glad t o see
that Lord R o t h s c h i l d in h i s
Commemoration day speech,
The Future, printed in F E L I X
i s s u e . no. 400'., strongly
indicated the absurdity of this
notion, at least for a long
time to come. I would like
to drive the point home with
some simple c a l c u l a t i o n s .
Let us be very optimistic
and suppose that the. growth
of the present world's
population of around 4000
million is reduced to 1%
per year. That means 40
million, y e s forty mi i I ion,
new people. In one year.
That means 110 thousand a
day or about 4600 chaps
and chapettes born every
hour.
Try getting rid of that
lot; i t ' s some logistical
problem!!
Yours faithfully,

Sir, — Since Peter Teague is
awaiting a reaction to h i s
column of the 7th of November:
here it i s . r
Having collected a s many
opinions as possible on the
hall of residence matter,
I feel that most students
would be quite happy having
their rooms cleaned only
once a week and making
their own beds, pr<«.'iding
this would cut the cost of
residence. The prices paid
in our h a l l s are not high
by London standards; but
it seems a pity to waste money
on a function w h i c h is largely
unnecessary, instead of
leaving it in the students'
pocket.
Yours faithfully,
1st year,
D i v i s i o n of Life Science
Sir, — I am writing in response
to Peter Teague's article in
F E L I X N o . 400 regarding the
effect the cleaning staff's
wages have on hall b i l l s .
It. seems to me that one
cleaner per landing is a
luxury most students cannot
afford. I would suggest one
cleaner per staircase per h a l l ,
thus cutting the cleaners and
their wage bill to a third at a
stroke. T h e cleaners duties
should be reduced to polishing
or^hoovering the floor of each
of the three landings once a
week. T h e three sets of
toilets, shower and bath
would s t i l l be cleaned d a i l y
as at present. The cleaners
could a l s o collect up dirty
linen and distribute the clean
ones.
Students would then dust
their rooms, clean their
s i n k s , and make their own
beds. Once a week, dirty
linen should be left folded on
the corners of the bed ready
for c o l l e c t i o n by the cleaners.
The students would then
remake their beds with the
clean linen.
I do not think t h a ' anv of
the above suggestions would
either take mu6h effort or take
up much of the students' time,
nor would the workload of the
staircase cleaner by any
greater than that of either of
the present landing cleaners.
Yours sincerely,

B a r prices
Sir, — It is with some concern
that I note that the bar prices
are about to be Increased
once again.
Over the past two years
we have seen a steady erosion
in the price differential
between the C o l l e g e Bars and
local P u b l i c H o u s e s . T h i s
latest price rise has produced
the situation whereby this
differential has become
negligible or even in some
c a s e s , non-existent. In an
effort to maximise profits
and thus offset any refectory
deficit, the B a r Committee
have opted for the I ay mans
way out, m i s s i n g the point
that prices and turnover are
inter-related. It is by no
means certain that higher
prices w i l l produce a higher
profit. Indeed s a l e s are
a I r e a d y d o w n o n t h e
corresponding period last
s e s s i o n . Students w i l l no
longer travel Into C o l l e g e for
a drink on the basis of price
alone.
It is a l s o time to point out
that the large -number of
outside bookings going through
the C o l l e g e enjoy the privilege
of drinking at 'the normal IC
rates. Surely if the profits are
to be Increased then the non-
College persons u t i l i s i n g the
bars should be c a l l e d upon to
pay a r e a l i s t i c price after
dinner s e r v i c e s .
I would urge the B a r
Committee, and e s p e c i a l l y
the student representatives to
reconsjder the pricing p o l i c i e s
By looking for Increased
profits from the students they
are In danger of k i l l i n g the
bars and turning last year's
small profit Into a loss.
I remain S i r , your obedient
servant,
K E I T H N A H L E R S
President C & G U .
