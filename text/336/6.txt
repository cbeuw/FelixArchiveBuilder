Letters
Sir,
I would like to take
this opportunity to ex-
press my thanks to those
who supported me in the
recent elections. Firstly,
my thanks go to Trev
Phillips for proposing
me and also for helping
with the campaign.
Secondly, but by no
means any the less im-
portant, my thanks go to
all those who voted for
me. I sympathise with
Gordon and Pete and
hope to be able to work
with them towards the
betterment of I.C. Union
next year.
Thank you,
PAUL WADWORTH
P.S. Starting my job
early don't forget the
Annual General Imperial
College Union meeting
to be held at 1.00 p.m.

Dear O H ,
O n d i s c u s s i o n w i t h
P a u l J o w i t t I have d e c i d -
ed this term there is no
point i n m y c o m i n g to
R o o m at the T o p at m y
usual time (Tuesdays
a n d Fridays 1.30-2.30)
as this no longer c o i n -
c i d e s w i t h students'
hjnchtime. I have there-
fore arranged that I c a n
be present between
|12.30 a n d 1.30 o n both
those days a n d w o u l d
tike you to m a k e a c o m -
ment to this effect i n
Felix as soon as possible.
Perhaps if y o u w o u l d
just put a little blurb
w h i c h says: " . . . Bonney
Hartnett, the Student
Counsellor, w i l l be avail-
able in the Welfare Cor-
ner of R o o m at the T o p
between 1 2 . 3 0 a n d 1.30
p . m . on Tuesdays a n d
Fridays. T h i s is a slight
change in time from last
term in order to coin-
c i d e with students' lunch
hour. A s it has been very
quiet up till n o w she will
w e l c o m e students to

mation/just for a c h a t " .
Please feel free to
play around with this as
you want however, so
long as the basic infor-
m a t i o n is there.

Sir,
I'm pleased to read
that Martin Doughty has
had the sense to start
reading the word of
GOD. Perhaps he will
come to know GOD in a
personal way through
the person of Jesus
Christ. Or perhaps it's
suposed to be funny, in
which case he must
think Christianity is a lot
of superstitious non-
sense. Well. I put this
question to him, to Jock
Veall, and any other
non - Christian: Jesus
Christ made some fan-
tastic claims. He said
he was GOD and that if
people believed in Him,
they could have eternal
life. He proved His
claims by doing miracles
and most important, by
being raised from the
dead as He had predict-
ed.
If people really need
to be convinced of the
deity of Jesus, all they
need to do is to look at
the evidence for the
resurrection (try "Who
Moved the Stone'' by
Frank Morison, who was
an atheist until he tried
to write a book disprov-
ing the resurrection j
and they will have all the
proof that they require.
If they then continue TO
deny Christ, fine, I hope
you enjoy it in Hell (but
of course you can't be-
lieve in that).
But if you do believe
Christ's claims to be
true, the way to claim
your eternal life is to in-
vite Jesus into your life
(Revelation 3:20) to for-
give your sins (which
would otherwise etern-
ally separate you from
GOD) and to take con-
trol of your life. If you
do this, I'll see you in
Heaven, I know you'll
enjoy it. GOD will reveal
His plan for your life
and fill you with the
Holy Spirit to enable you
to do all the things He
wants you to (the most
important of which is tell
others about Christ).
The third possibility
is that you will continue
to deny Christ without
looking at the evidence.
This college is supposed
to be made up of scien-
tists, who work on facts.
I could say that the
world is square and flat,
but we all know that
isn't true because of the
facts, to which I reply.
"But I haven't looked at
the facts!" Similarly it is
foolish to deny Christ
without investigating the
facts.
I hope everyone who
reads this looks at the
facts and makes a deci-
sion one way or the
other. If you have any
questions, I'm sure any
Christian will be only too
pleased to answer them,
or come and see me per-
sonally.
Remember John 3:16,
Romans 6:23 and 3:23,
John 14:6 and Ephes-
ians 2:8, 9.
I and my brothers and
sisters in Christ are
praying for you all.

P.S. This letter refers
to you too, Oily.
Sir,
Interesting to see the
letter in last week's
Felix about the POPU-
LATION DAY demon-
strations held on Satur-
day, May 12. The Daily
Express editorial on the
following Monday said
the first thing we should
do is to ban immigra-
tion. Well, why didn't
we think of that? The
obvious solution to sta-
bilise the World popu-
lation. The Express, pre-
sumably, would want to
keep the Africans in
Africa to work for Bri-
tish industry below the
poverty line. The Guard-
ian, bless it, in its
leader the following day,
equated the Africans'
starvation wages with
Duncan Sandys £50,000
from Lohnro for his con-
sultancy on African
affairs.
The Guardian's head-
line when the Lohnro
story broke:— "Lohnro
paid Duncan Sandys
£130,000" (in compen-
sation tax-free by way of
the Cayman Islands)
was matched by the
Telegraph's the same
day "Duncan Sandys
paid back £44,000"
(They're really into ex-
colonial secretaries) and
Private Eye's:—"Gnom-
hro paid Mr. Sunken
Glandys £2 million."
Incidentally the Ex-
press's sister paper, the
Evening Standard, was
at it again. Their head-
line of: "Handcuffed
Hell's Angel found in
Thames" turned out to
be a 30 year old meat
porter with a tattoo on
his arm wearing a lea-
ther jacket and a decora-
tive bracelet.
Yours in Christ-knows
where,

Martin Doughty goes
ON SAFARI
. . . to Norfolk
I'm currently staying b e d a n d
breakfast in a little village pub o n
the North Norfolk coast courtesy of
an M S c project. T h e bed very satis-
fying; the breakfast gargantuan a n d
completely disrupting m y nutritional
habits.
I must be on one of the only M S c
projects w h e n y o u send postcards
home. " W e a t h e r g r e a t " , " W i s h y o u
were here", " B e t y o u w i s h y o u w e r e
h e r e . " A l l is not roses, though. T h e
s a m p l i n g equipment, having previous-
ly functioned better than the w i l d e s t
dreams h a d anticipated, emerged
from 5 0 metres d o w n a 6 inch bore-'
hole (note the clever use of units)
minus its a l l too important excretory
appendage. F o l l o w i n g close on the
purchaoing of £3 worth of clothes-
line a n d "<ts subsequent measuring off
in metre lengths, a n d its subsequent
gross entanglement, this w a s no
morale booster.
But the local environment does not
let the spirits s a g . I dashed back from
N o r w i c h last night thinking I might
be locked out to arrive at half past
midnight w i t h the pub still full of
rosy faces a n d thundering out early
sixties-Irish ballads (which is a dis-
advantage admitted). Not, alas, that
every village pub here is such a hive
of activity into the early hours or, i n -
deed, at a l l . O l d acquaintances, W a t -
neys, w h o seem to have an almost
total monopoly of the houses, have
been closing them d o w n in the
smaller villages where the profits
were a little too modest to avoid the
accountant's pruning shears. (What
was that about Watney M a n n ' s trading
figures for last year?) A n d more than
just pulling out, they let the licence
lapse so the village ceases to have a
pub at a l l . It increases the account-
ant's viability for the one in the next
village.
Rural public transport suffers a
concurrent a n d m i s g u i d e d decline
when it ought to be augmented to
function as a social service. T h e o l d
folk, bewildered, are left stranded in
their o w n homes to finish their days.
(Remember the M a n A l i v e documen-
tary " W h a t ' s happening d o w n at the
l o c a l " a while back with the o l d men
in tears?) T h e young leave. T h e com-
munity is destroyed.
Even so, the predominance of regu-
lars in the remaining pubs has re-
tained fairly modest prices w i t h
" N o r w i c h " bitter at 1 3 p a pint in
deference to London W a t n e y s at
2 0 p + a n d the N o r w i c h brewer c o u l d
well teach the head brewer something
about tastebuds.
This area is encouraging in an-;
other, more important w a y . It has
been just a little bit too inaccessible
to the capital to c o m e under very
close scrutiny from the property
speculators. There are, though, dis-
mal signs that second h o m e s are
creeping in w h i c h w i l l inevitably des-
troy its unique character if they be-
c o m e a n established feature. A l l of
w h i c h is a salutary reminder that the
modern social vandal, the m a n of
property, i s a l s o still a m a n of action,
albeit destruction. The cities, w i t h
the recent Netting Hill siege, the
C h a r i n g Cross R o a d flats w i t h W e s t -
minster's ridiculous reference to " d e -
c a n t i n g " the residents (as opposed
to evicting, whatever is the differ-
ence) a n d the general concern for
city centre c o m m u n i t i e s being cur-
rently expressed in the media, need
no reminder. T h e villages of North
Norfolk probably d o .
Social irresponsibility of specula-
tors, Watneys, Traffic engineers a n d
the like in such circumstances u n -
doubtedly leads to the destruction of
communities a n d local character a n d
personality. W h a t must be remem-
bered, however, is that there is no
c o m m o n , conscious conspiracy to
propagate this destruction. M a n y
socially retrograde policies carried
out at national a n d local level are(
often heralded as part of some giant
conspiracy. M o s t are not a n d for that
very reason are more difficult to
counter since they do not have a
c o m m o n purpose although usually a
c o m m o n m o t i v a t i o n — g r e e d a n d selt
f i s h n e s s — a n d a c o m m o n , a n d de-
pressing, result.
W e l l , I hope the journey back to
big L is as g o o d a s the one out. A s
anyone w h o k n o w s m e w i l l tell, I'm
really into trains a n d the company
was excellent on this one, too. It's
nice to meet up w i t h people you've
only ever k n o w n at a curious distance.
A n d as those w h o k n o w m e w i l l also
tell, I have this disconcerting habit of
meeting up w i t h some very strange
people on trains (cont. page 9 4 ) .
