IMPERIAL COLLEGE INVESTMENTS
IN SOUTH AFRICA
F E L I X r e v e a l s a l l
Some weeks ago a FELIX reporter asked the College for
a list of their investments in connection with a joint article
with other student newspapers on University of London
investments in South Africa. They refused to co-operate.
Now FELIX has unearthed the 1971 data. We wonder how
much it has changed..
O w i n g to a certain
degree of reticence on
behalf of the College
Authorities to reveal
their investments, FELIX
has unearthed the i n -
vestments that IC h a d
in August 1971 in vari-
ous firms a n d compan-
ies. FELIX does not know
h o w m u c h money w a s
involved with each firm
nor does it k n o w whe-
ther the stocks a n d
shares a r e still h e l d in
any of these companies:
these, FELIX feels are
questions w h i c h t h e C o l -
lege s h o u l d answer, a s
it involves the lives a n d
welfare of many work-
ers, black a n d white, as
well a s the consciences
of students, staff a n d all
those employed at IC.
Out of the list of 5 9
companies, w e have
chosen the ones w h i c h
have figured in the news
lately, for o n e brand of
infamy or another, par-
ticularly those in S o u t h
A f r i c a .
Top of the list of the
Anti Apartheid 'slave
labour' list employers
c o m e s British Leyland
w h i c h pays its semi-
skilled a n d unskilled
African employees an
average wage of £7 per
week. This firm has also
created redundancies in
its British factories over
the last twelve months.
Despite the self-evident
profit making opportuni-
ties of operating in
South A f r i c a , British
Leyland failed to make
the fat profits w h i c h the
other firms have made
there.
Barclays B a n k w h o
pay their A f r i c a n work-
ers £47 per month c o m -
pared to £210 for
whites, sparked off a
student drive to change
their accounts to other
banks, owing to their
extremely l o w A f r i c a n /
w h i t e employee ratio. A
spokesman for Barclays
speaking on a television
programme said that
this low ratio w a s ex-
plained by the apartheid
laws of the Vorster Gov-
ernment. T h o u g h Bar-
c l a y s ' ratio is unusually
low, even for banks,
there is no doubt that it
is only the repressive
measures of the Vorster
regime, f o r example that
the Africans are not
allowed to form unions,
that enable firms like
Barclays to operate
there under a 'clear'
conscience.
Distillers Ltd. need
no introduction for their
outstanding work in
m a i m i n g children with
thalidomide in the name
of profits, a n d it is/was
these profits that enable
this college to w a x fat.
Delta Metal Co. pay
starvation wages in
South A f r i c a , have re-
cently s a c k e d workers
in this country a n d have
just paid £125,000 for
the J o b u r g factory of
D o r m a n n Electrical
Sales, a n d the profits
roll back to IC I
Guest, Keen a n d Net-
tlefold, w h o created a
stir during the W i l s o n
wage freeze b y slipping
a 3 0 per cent wage rise
for their chairman
through the board of
directors, pay their South
African workers £5.50
p.w., a n d have recently
sacked workers in this
country.
ICI pay their African
workers £8.30 p.w.,
have recently sacked
workers in this country
and have just built a
new plant in South

last year through the
purveyance of carcino-
gens a n d hope to m a k e
m o r e this year. W h a t ' s
good for them is g o o d
for us remember! IC also
had investments in
British American Tobac-
co L t d . in 1 9 7 1 .
Unilever, infamous
exploiter of W e s t a n d
East African labour are
well-known to the M o n o -
polies C o m m i s s i o n In
this country. Although
they don't have quite a
monopoly on margarine
here, they d o produce
8 0 per cent of what is
sold, though under six
different brand names,
and the profits all g o
back to Unilever, of
course!
FELIX doesn't have a
copy of the Anti-Apar-
theid blacklist, it has
had to rely on its collec-
tive memory a n d back
copies of the Guardian
for an analysis of what
the firms IC invested i n ,
in 1 9 7 1 , are doing today
in South A f r i c a a n d else-
where. People are w e l -
come to see the full list
in the FELIX office a n d
ponder on the morality
of using equipment paid
for out of starving Afri-
cans. W e w o n d e r what
investments IC h a s to-
day a n d out of what
dubious practices the

"The Broadsheet they
wouldn't let
Yes, there W A S a
Broadsheet o u t last
Thursday, it w a s what
you might call a limited
edition, since 2 0 copies
only is pretty limited.
W h e n I left the R S C U
office W e d n e s d a y night
(at 1 1 . 3 0 p.m.) there
were 4 0 0 copies of this
term's bumper 2 0 page
edition neatly sorted out
into piles for e a c h year
and department, I took
20 h o m e w i t h ime. B u t
when I returned at 9 . 0 0
a.m. the following morn-
ing there they w e r e —
gone! " W h o c o u l d have
done this foul d e e d ? "
you're probably asking
yourself, w e l l let's con-
sider the possibilities.
Perhaps the m o s t ob-
vious initial answer is to
say they must have been
stolen by mines or
guilds as part of the
'mascotry' raids that
have b e c o m e quite fre-
quent this past (aca-
d e m i c ) year. Question
— b u t c a n guilds or
mines get into the R S C U
office without a key?
A n s w e r — P e r h a p s . How-
ever h a d a raiding party
from either of these 2
colleges removed the
Broadsheets then w h y
weren't they tempted to
help themselves to any
of the N U M E R O U S
signs currently in the
office? A n d w h y haven't
we heard A N Y T H I N G
since?
This leads us onto
the second inevitable
conclusion, that some-
one w i t h a key (there are
about a dozen) stole
them either late W e d -
nesday night, or early
Thursday morning. What
possible motive c o u l d
such a person have?
W e l l perhaps this c a n
be answered if I explain
the general format a n d
contents that this e d i -
tion of Broadsheet h a d .
you see
S o m e time ago I 'dis-
g u i s e d ' the cover to look
like a Rag M a g a n d this
idea w a s very popular
with most people a n d
that particular edition
sold w e l l . S o w h e n plan-
ning what to d o in m y
L A S T Broadsheet I
thought I'd re-employ
the same basic idea b u t
take it a stage further. S o
I designed the front page
to look like a typical
" M e n ' s i M a g a z i n e " a n d
called it " P e n t s h e e t , "
this w a s coupled with a
full frontal pin-up a n d
" s p o t the n i p p l e " con-
test on pages 1 0 - 1 1 .
There w a s a lot of pro-
test at first to this idea.
Which resulted in one
photo being censored,
but over 9 0 per cent
was finally passed. A t
the beginning of this
term I w a s given a series
of profiles on the R C S U
officers, written b y
someone w h o w i s h e s to
remain a n o n y m o u s a n d
who called himself
" S c a r a m a n g a . " These
profiles w e r e non-com-
plimentary i n the m a i n
but quite factual a n d in
fact I offered informa-
mation about people a n d
events to the author in
order to get h i m to alter
parts of the profiles I
thought were unneces-
sarily nasty. This he d i d
and w i t h further editing
of some profiles they
went into Broadsheet
(Pentsheet) last week.
However it seems s o m e
people took severe per-
sonal offence at either
their nick-name (which
nearly everyone w a s
blessed with) or des-
cription a n d this just
M A Y have provided the
motive for someone to
prevent this edition be-
ing sold b y stealing it
all. If persons in the
position of " a n officer of
the u n i o n " cannot take
criticism of themselves
then- they are in a
rather poor state. It
was the belief that such
comments w o u l d be ig-
nored, or laughed off
etc. that persuaded m e
to include the " S c a r a -
m a n g a " columns in this
Broadsheet. A l s o inside
it w e r e full reports on
how R . C . S . w o n the
Sparke's c u p , our Great

grated b y parts . . . e t c . "
So there y o u have it, 2 0
pages of perhaps the
m o s t controversial
Broadsheet ever, 2 0
pages w h i c h has been
well received, l i k e d a n d
talked about by the few
to have seen them. B u t
because of the actions
of an exceedingly c h i l d -
ish individual or group,
all the time, effort a n d
money put into this
b u m p e r edition w i l l be
wasted, unless w e c a n
retrieve the m i s s i n g
4 0 0 V E R Y soon. T o
those w h o spent a lot o f
time writing, typing a n d
helping out in many
w a y s I c a n only say I
a m very sorry a n d dis-
appointed that your
work has been sabo-
taged.
Naturally I w o u l d like
there to be a Broadsheet
out this term a n d so
anyone with information
about the possible
whereabouts of the 4 0 0
copies is asked to con-
tact m e personally or
via P h y s i c s letter rack.
It w o u l d be a shame to
let the actions of a few
spoil the enjoyment of
the many w h o looked
forward to getting their
copy last week, especi-
ally after w e even went
to the trouble of produc-
ing 5 0 copies devoid of
nudes, at the w i s h e s of
M a u r i c e M a l o n e y , for
sale to Chemistry II. It
w o u l d seem that free-
d o m of the press a n d
free speech are being
physically attacked at
I.C., w e l l in R . C . S . at
least.
