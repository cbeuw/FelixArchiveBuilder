UNION SECRETARY
THREATENS TO
CASTRATE EDITOR
Election result "leak" results
in change of regulations
Our front page article last week, "leaking" the elec-
tion results, caused a major row between Union Sec-
retary Martin C . Black and F E L I X editor Oliver
Dowson.
M r . Black claimed that A P O L O G Y
letting the result out ren-
dered the ratification of
election procedure at a
Obviously this point is
correct. , F E L I X would
thus like to apologise to
M r . Black for any incon-
union meeting, necessary venience caused to h i m
under the constitution, and for omitting his ' C i n
pointless. H e argued that l a s t

However, o u r article
seems to have h a d some
considerable results of its
own! A s announced by
Martin C . Black during his
Returning Officer's R e -
port, changes to election
procedure are going to
be made which will mean
that the result c a n be
announced immediately
the count has finished. It
should also mean that
future generations of
F E L I X editors will not
have to risk their virility
in order to spread the
news.

The result was, of
course, exactly that prin-

ures were almost exactly as
reported—in fact, we just
rounded them off to the

A P A T H y Cm K I L L . '
by noted apathologist. Dr. L. Y. Knott (author of
"Apathy—Who Cares?")
Apathy is on the increase. T o talk of a n e p i d e m i c
is. no exaggeration; the disease is n o w nearly a s
c o m m o n a s measles. It is a n unpleasant subject, I
agree, but the facts w i l l not go away if w e ignore
them. T h o u s a n d s of people w e r e treated last year
in Britain alone; probably m i l l i o n s of others went
untreated a n d even undiagnosed. For that is one of
the tragedies of apathy: many sufferers d o not even
realise they are i l l — u n t i l too late.
The first s y m p t o m s — b o r e d o m a n d irritation
w i t h the surroundings — are s e l d o m recognised a s
danger signs a n d m a y even go unnoticed. Then
comes the s e c o n d , or latent, phase Where, although
dissatisfaction has increased, the v i c t i m has lost the
persist for months of years, w i t h the sufferer c o m -
pletely unaware that he is in any w a y unhealthy.
(Typical s y m p t o m s at this stage include eating fish
fingers, s u b s c r i b i n g to " R e a d e r ' s D i g e s t " , a n d
many others w h i c h only a specialist w o u l d recog-
nise). M o d e r n treatment is s i m p l e , but without it he
endangers not only himself but also risks infecting
anyone w i t h w h o m he h a s contact. A n d without
treatment, the final collapse is tragic, swift a n d in
e v i t a b l e — p a r a l y s i s of varying degree, loss of touch
with surroundings, mental decay and in many cases,
death. For this m e d i c a l science has no cure.
Apathy is not restricted to the young. It can strike
anyone: the respected m a n in a high position, or
even, tragically, the faithful wife w h o h a s never
once broken her marriage vows. But statistics s h o w
that young people, a n d particularly students, run
desire t o d o anything about it. This condition m a y
the highest risk of a l l . A r e you one of them?
The test below has been scientifically designed
to measure your apathy rating. It is intended only as
a guide; if the results suggest y o u are apathetic y o u
should see a specialist for further tests. ( A l l treat-
ment is strictly confidential). D o not delay: remem-
ber, tomorrow may b e too late.

you w o r k e d u p the interest to read a s far a s this,
your condition is average-—you have the m i l d i r
