The Government has at length reacted to
the INUS demand for higher grants, and has
awarded a £20 increase in addition to the £20
increase already allowed for in the 1971 re-
view for the coming year. The undergraduate
grant will thus be £520 in London, Oxford
and Cambridge, £485 elsewhere. (£480 and
£445 respectively this year). The cost to the
Exchequer will be £10 million.
This is the first time
that a government has
awarded an increase
in grant other than at
the triennial review
(the next is next year).
I n s t a n t reaction
from N U S and IC
Union was unfavour-
able. The increases
were called paltry by
comparison with the
£100 increase de-
manded. It w a s
pointed out that 65p
a week would go no-
where near matching
the price rises caused
by this year's infla-
tion, let alone next
year's.
The N U S was es-
pecially angry that
the increases were
only for students on
mandatory grants, i.e.
those at universities
a n d polytechnics.
S t u d e n t s on dis-
cretionary awards —
those at universities
Further Education,
Techs., etc.—received
no satisfaction- The
N U S had demanded
abolition of these
lower discretionary
awards, and Easter
Conference at Exeter
pledged the Executive
to refuse any increase
in mandatory grants
u n t i l discretionary
awards are abolished.
The N U S thus finds
itself in a difficult
position over this
grants increase, and
the position will have
to be worked out at
t h e Extraordinary
Conference to be held
here at Imperial Col-
lege on June 8th or
9th. Felix will bring
you the first — and
possibly only — stu-
dent press report in
our last issue of term,
on June 12th. (Most
student papers have
already finished pub-
lishing for the year).

Mr. Mooney asked the Refectory Committee to approve a 1\ per
cent increase in meal prices at its meeting on Thursday morning.
This was one of several
possibilities discussed by
the committee in order to
avoid an e s t i m a t e d
£35,100 deficit in catering
over the next academic
year. The Universities
Grants Committee, which
administers all the funds
for universities and col-
leges in the United K i n g -
dom requires college re-
fectories to break even,
and will not give Sibsi-
dies.
A 1\ per cent increase
in price given that con-
sumption remains con-
stant and using bar and
cellar profits to reduce
the loss, should let the re-
fectories scrape home next
June with a slight surplus.
One alternative that
was put by the U n i o n re-
presentatives on the com-
mitteee was that students
should accept a 2\ per
cent increase (equivalent
to the rise just given in
the grant) and asked the
Governing B o d y for a
subsidy to cover the rest
of the deficit, or, alterna-
tively that the Governing
Body should make good
the entire deficit.
\
These suggestions were
put to last Thursday's
Union Meeting by the
Union representatives on
the committee, John Lane,
Gordon Jackson and R o b
Armitage. The meeting
decided to opt for the
latter preference, i.e. no
increases.
This was put to the ad-
journed* Refectory C o m -
mittee meeting on Friday
morning, and other mem-
bers " s e e m e d sym-
pathetic to our views,"
John Lane told Felix.
The Committee has
now put in a submission
to the Governing B o d y
on the matter. They have
to approve any price i n -
creases, and in usual prac-
tice they "rubber-stamp"
the Refectory Committee
decisions.
This time five alterna-
tive courses have been
put to them, ranging from
the no increase/100 per
cent subsidy demanded
by the Union, through
the compromise ''A per
cent to the full 71 per
cent increase. Develop-
ments are awaited, and
U n i o n representatives
seem reasonably hopeful
of their demand being
given a fair reception.
