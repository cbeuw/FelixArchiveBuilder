bookable, and I should, unless y o u

Lindsay Anderson doesn't make
films very often, he has only made
" T h e Sporting L i f e " a n d "If" i n the
last 10 years or so. B u t even so he is
one of the best known British direc-
tors, because however much you
may resent his attitude, his tech-
nique is both very slick and very dir-
ect. Unfortunately, since his films
have on average four years between
them, he tends to go i n and out of
vogue quite quickly; and since we
film critics are fickle things, some of
us couldn't remember if he was com-
ing into or out of vogue. Hence his
new film. " 6 L u c k y M a n ! " G o t very
mixed reviews. ,
It is a traumatic film of real ex-
tremes, like i n a way, M o n t y Python,
which is "brilliant" unless y o u find
yourself on the receiving end of
the humour, when it becomes "rub-
bish." This film take a d i g at every-
one; one gets the impression that
Lindsay Anderson has been quietly
festering somewhere for a few years
and has suddenly come out to come
and tell us. what he thinks of us, the
establishment, the rich, the poor, the
intellectual—everyone i n fact. So
don't see the film i f , you're easily
offended., j -
The film is supposedly based on
M a l c o l m MacDowell's experiences
as a coffee salesman and social clim-
ber brimming over with confidence.
Straight out of school. H e is M i c k
Travis (of 'If) again—not so origin-
al, but more ambitious, he wants to
be successful, rich and famous. I
think we are meant to regard it as a
fofiow-on from "If" — his old head-
master re-appears re-personified as
the director of the coffee factory, and
again as a prison governor. This is
possibly what I found so killing
about this film. It is implied that a l l
people can be classified into types—
hence a l l the actors play 3 or 4 diff-
erent parts, and it's fun trying to
play "Spot the Celebrity." A r t h u r
Lowe, for example, turns up as the
training officer i n the coffee factory,
a dishonest hotelier, and a n African
head of state. I must admit I found
it difficult to imagine Arthur L o w e
in black make-up saying "hello
there," that is, until I saw the film.
M i c k Travis bounces from situa-
tion to situation—it would spoil it to
let on exactly what he does do, since
half the fun of the film is the confu-
sion. B u t the direction is faultless
and biting; he even keeps the pseuds
at bay by opening the film with a
shot of A l a n Price and band doing
the sessions for the Musical Score i n
a studio. Lindsay Anderson himself
sitting beside h i m , stop watch i n •
hand. Very Brechtian. It continues
to be Brechtian as the other songs
are not superimposed on soundtrack
but more shots i n studio; and finally
it becomes uncontrollably Brechtian
by having M i c k Travis' last exper-
ience being picked out of a crowd of
hopefuls, by Lindsay Anderson him-
self, to star i n a Lindsay Anderson
film. H e is told to pose and smile, as
an " O L u c k y M a n . " Clapperboard
is thrust i n front of him. T h e rest of
the film is not very Brectian at a l l ,
however.
But there's n o point i n getting a l l
poofy and intellectual about this
film. I hope you saw " F i l m 7 3 " last
week when some film critic tried to
get a l l poofy and intellectual (bad) i n
front of Lindsay Anderson (fatal)
and being told to poof off. This is
an escapist, enjoyable film—lots of
sex, violence, humour and pathos. So
do see it, if only for the experience.
Besides, it may be the 'in' film of the
year, and y o u can impress your
friends b y talking about it (like I have
been attempting to d o a l l week).

J u d g e R o y B e a n
'The Life and Times of Judge R o y
Bean.' Directed b y John Huston.
'Judge R o y Bean' i n the latest i n
the long line of 'realistically mythical'
western which starred with " T h e man
who shot Liberty V a l a n c e " and rea-
ched a peak with " B u t c h Cassidy and
the Sundance K i d . " L i k e these other
films ' R o y Bean' takes a nostalgic
look at the taming of the W i l d West
at the turn of the century, the story
being amusingly fantastic but given
a scrupulous attention to period de-
tail.
It is about a crook (Paul Newman)
who, after being robbed i n a bandit's
bordelo, decides to bring his o w n vio-
lent brand of law to the area.
Under his lynch l a w the town ex-
pands and changes and he settles
down to life with a local girl Marie
Elena (Vicky Privizal) who is second
only to his idol L i l y Langtry i n his
affections. However his unorthodox
methods and refusal to become 'res-
pectable' with the town makes h i m
enemies w h o bring about his down-
fall as a sly lawyer whom he once
humiliated takes over, this and the
death of M a r i e Elena i n childbirth
induce h i m to ride into the sunset i n
best tradition.
Unlike K i n g Arthur he returns 20
years later when the lawyer tries to
evict his daughter from what is now
an o i l town. In a spectacular blazing
shoot up R o y Bean gets his revenge
and goes into history. T h e final scene
shows L i l y Langtry ( A v a Gardner)
visting what is now a ghost town re-
turned to its hick origin the cycle
completed, the myth established.
The film is constructed episodically
which accounts for its unevenness,
black humour needs to be very care-
fully done, and the director (John
Huston, one of the old Hollywood
school) sometimes miscalculates, I
don't for instance, think someone
having his toes blown off is funny. H e
also has a tendency to be oversenti-
mental and derivative, often i n the
same scenes, remember Paul New-
man and Katherine Ross with bicycle
and Sacha Distel i n 'Butch Cassidy"?
W e l l here we have Paul Newman and
V i c k y Privizal with see-saw a n d
would y o u believe A n d y Williams
singing something called " m a r m a -
lade, molasses and honey"? Needless
to say the song is as sickly as the
title suggests.
These mistakes and more elemen-
tary ones of continuity and timing
stop the film realising its full poten-
tial which is shown especially when
he returns, to defend his daughter's
rights; the ensuing shoot a n d burn-
up is one of the most enjoyable pieces
of cinema for a long time, scenes
such as this and the 'cameo' scenes
with Anthony 'Psycho' Perkins, H u s :
ton himself and others, make this
film in spite of its faults one of the
more enjoyable ones going the
rounds.

F a m i l y
Family always have h a d a reputa-
tion as being musically, a very fine
band, and Thursday night d i d little
but enhance just that. Their set be-
gan with some tromping music, i n
which I suppose I should remember
but don't, to which they appeared
and started into what was quite a
freaky number for Family, complete
with staffe effects—a smokebomb.
lasting well throughout the first ten
minutes or so, and their own lights,
blending and changing well with the
mood of the music. Rather unfortun-
ate for the people at the front though
who soon rose, spluttering, to their
feet as it spewed over from the stage.
O n the whole they played quite a
versatile set with times when they did
the more acoustic numbers from their
album "Fearless," and times when
they fairly rocked, especially with
"Burlesque" and "Weaver's Answer"
the latter being slightly adapted to
suit the new line-up rather for the
worse I thought, as it was a little
sloppy i n the middle.
The only black mark to the even-
ing was that Roger C h a p m a n ap-
peared the worse for drink, a n d
threw a phenomenal amount of mic-
rophone stands a n d tambourines
about, often into the front row of
the audience, w h o remained, fortun-
ately very docile about it.
Phillip Goodhand Tait, the sup-
port act, I liked very much, singing
rather soulfully and sincerely his own
compositions (apart from the, two
Buddy H o l l y classics he slipped in),
>elf-accompanied on the piano,
hough there were times when he
milled out some Cocker power. T h e
only thing he d i d wrong for me was
to stop so early.
