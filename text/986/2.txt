Blighted Beit Bites Back!
The Jazz and Rock room is located beneath the New Hostel of Beit Hall
BY LYNN BRAVEY
The future of the Jazz and Rock
Club is in doubt following
complaints by residents of Beit
Hall. The society, where Brian May
started his musical career, will
probably have to relocate due to
"intolerable noise levels".
Charles Leary, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) and
ex-president of the Jazz and Rock
Club outlined the situation: "The
practise rooms are currently located
in the basement of Beit Hall's New
Hostel, and the sound consequently
travels upwards making walls
vibrate. One solution would be if
the practise rooms were on the top
floor of the building, though we're
still unsure where they're going to
end up."
Five years ago the problem did
not exist as the Jazz and Rock Club
practised in what is now the Rag

Brian Lloyd Davies, the Secretary
to the Delegacy at St. Mary's

resigned. In a farewell speech, he
cited an old-fashioned attitude as
one of the reasons for his departure.
After an education including the
University of Wales and Glamorgan

Andrew Wensley, the Union
President, has apologised following
allegations of deceit and
incompetence made against him. He
expressed his regret at his past
inadequacies when dealing with
College matters at a meeting of the
Union Executive Committee on
Monday.
A letter leaked to Felix last week
confirmed fears that M r Wensley
had misled students at Imperial. An
outline of the letter from the
College Registrar, Peter Mee, was

tional Bar. The club was moved to
make way for a welfare office.
Following complaints in
previous years, an agreement was
drawn up whereby the practise
rooms were only to be used when
the library was open, enabling
residents to study there. This year's
residents, however, are unhappy
with the situation. Dr John Finley,
the Warden of Beit Hall, told Felix:
"People renting a room want to be
able use it. The current
arrangements haven't worked and
the practise rooms are being
moved."
Further grievances have been
brought up by residents of the hall.
It appears that after many years, the
stairways in the hall have now had
carpets fitted. The rooms
themselves, however, remain
uncarpeted and students are still

joined Imperial College in 1968 as
an Administrative Officer. In 1988,
after 13 years experience as Deputy
College Secretary, he became
Secretary to the Delegacy at St
Mary's (the senior member of
Imperial College's administration at
St Mary's).
In a speech given at his farewell
reception, Mr Lloyd Davies made
several satirical comments about the
running of the College. These
remarks were said to be likely to
printed in last week's issue of Felix.
The full document was presented to
the Executive Committee at the
meeting on Monday.
They suggested that a working
party be formed to meet and discuss
the development of the constitution,
taking into account the comments
contained within the letter.
Charles Leary, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), told Felix:
"Andrew feels now that he held
information away from the students
for too long. It has to be appreciated
that he had a lot going on at the
time and was trying to be sure that
in preference to the rooms.
One resident commented: "It's
been rumoured that the rooms are
going to be carpeted but we're still
not sure when. We think it would
also have been better if they had
cause embarrassment to members of
the administration.
Amongst other things, he
mentioned the importance of the
history of an institution in its
contemporary running. He is said to
have criticised the current link
between Imperial and St Mary's.
Mr Lloyd Davies offered several
pieces of advice to his successor
and ended by expressing a hope that
Imperial's administration would
improve in the future.
all information was correct before it
was presented to the students."
The Executive Committee
meeting also highlighted the need
for more in-house training. M r
Leary stated: "There is a problem
with the current training methods.
All Executive members are invited
to a course over the summer
vacation but many are unable to
attend."
Mr Wensley stressed the "need
for improved training for all union
posts". It is now being suggested
that ideas for training next year's
Executive be put forward by this

when most students were away.
Many people cannot see the point of
carpeting the stairway and think it's
a waste of money that could have
been better spent."
Fines Up
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Students in London are in uproar
over excessive library fines. Penal-
ties of up to £5 per day at the
School of Oriental and African
Studies (SOAS) have caused
complaints from Student Unions.
The school introduced fines of
50 pence per hour on short loan
books, including essential
textbooks. This system mirrors the
one used in Imperial College's
libraries, which has been
successfully in place for some time.
A S O A S library official
commented: "Many students were
failing to return books on time,
denying other students access to
them. This new system will provide
an incentive to return them on
time."
According to the SOAS library,
over £12,000 of its £300,000
budget will be spent on additional
copies of books. However, the
Students' Union have predicted this
will not be sufficient. They say
students could find themselves with
fines topping £100.
Co-president William Bell said
"What we need is more books, not
fines. A l l this system will do is
penalise students for an inability to
conform to an outdated and
inadequate system."
