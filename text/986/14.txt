Cop Shoot Cop
The Garage
Imagine a carcrash between Nirvana and Nine
Inch Nails; the twisted metal wreckage careen-
ing onto a sidewalk where the ghost of John Lee
Hooker plays the blues. Imagine what this
sounds like over the white noise of the city, the
backbeat of human despair...Imagine all this and
it still doesn't describe the sheer vitriolic inten-
sity of Cop Shoot Cop live.
They open hostilities with 'Surprise,
Surprise', a no nonsense shotgun blast of guitar
noise and adrenalin overlaid with industrial
strength drums. Tod A radiates a sour cynicism,
lacing every line with poisonous ire, but then
this guy could make a shopping list sound
threatening.
More bodyblows follow: 'Room 429' does
its best to turn off the night; 'Cause and Effect'
is spat out with nonchalent venom; 'Ten Dollar
Bill' sounds impossibly good and the single,
'Ambulance Song', serves up a sleazy slice of
the Big Apple. Just in case we're unconvinced
they blast us in the head with three encores, then
saunter off stage without looking back.

Mudhoney
Five Dollar Bob's...
When Mark Arm first wheeled his daddy's '69
Mustang onto the lawn, called his mates and
invented Garage, Mudhoney were like nothing
else. His mates called up their mates, Garage
became Grunge and Mudhoney were still like
nothing else, sadly not even their former glory.
The atrocious 'Piece of Cake' summed them
up - it's a cinch, they said, and the result was as
insubstantial as a cream puff. Luckily they
drowned their tears to a backdrop of 'Superfuzz,
Bigmuff, the dazzling first EP, coming back
with...well, a dazzling EP in the Superfuzz vein.
Not original and thank god for that. (8)
Owain
Bettie Serveert regret those pickled onions.
Killer Shrews
Killer Shrews
It's interesting that while the collaboration
between Adams, Sting and Stewart is not as
execrable as the sum of its parts, the Killer
Shrews' album, featuring former members of
the Mekons, Pere Ubu and Captain Beefheart's
Magic Band, is nowhere near as exciting as any
of its constituents. For, despite the quirky and,
let's face it, downright obscure origins of the
band members, this is a tedious pop-rock
album. In fact, they use every trick in the book:
the choruses go "nah-nah-nah-nah" and every
song has a guitar solo. One or two veer a bit
more in the direction of hardcore, but the feel-
ing is that this MUST be a joke. There are parts
startling reminiscent of Spinal Tap and past
efforts tell you that these people know better.
But why? If it's a parody, it's a devilishly clever
one and if not then it's a stultifying waste of
time. (2)
Guy
Welcome back to never-never-land. There's
more than one way of not growing up, you know.
First on our list of favourite things is the deli-
cious smile of Kristin Hersh with her new sin-
gle, 'Your Ghost' (4AD). "This is entrancing.
Her raw emotive voice weaves a spell of regret
and lost love, while Michael Stipe duets on a
crossed line, unable to connect. In a darkly
beautiful song, Hersh seems finally to have laid
her many ghosts to rest," sayeth Joe.
And so we slip quietly away, in fact slip into
the restrained couch possessed by Therapy?
Coming in low with 'Nowhere' (A&M), Freddy
Cheeseworth explains in words understandable
to the average Kerrang! reader: "With standard
Heavy Metal riffs and catchy Pop refrain, this is
ultimately pleasing but, aptly-named, goes...
Maybe they're desperate to return to the Top Of
the Pops studio."
But onwards and upwards. Bettie Serveert
release 'Palomine' (Beggars Banquet), before
going to work on a new album for release later
this year. Carol Van Dijk gets to raise her most
excellent voice with alarming speed and the lead
guitarist acts like the punk leftover which he
does oh so well. Certainly a band to watch.
Hitting the lower reaches of hellish names is
tricky, but Rancho Diablo do what they can.
Glyph waxes about 'Plan B ' (Mute): " A very
clinical-sounding studio single with interesting
noises and squashed basslines. Oppressive, hor-
rid and rather good. In the words of Pete Murray
'I'll give it a hit, but I wouldn't buy it'."
In the true style of continuity announcers the
world over, Glyph swiftly transfers his attention
to Passion Fruit and Holy Bread who have an
EP out on Splendid. "The sad name comes from
the very unsad 'She Bangs The Drums' by the
Stone Roses and they seem to have gleaned all
the crap elements of that era. Having said that,
PFAHB have musical potential and the b-side
is a sable bristled number."
Drugstore, pictured above and once of the
Union Lounge, are presently in the capable
hands of Owain. "We expected Horse and got
it, cut through with tarnished snow, the result
an anti-climax. 'Modern Pleasure' lifts, but it
doesn't soar like the 'Store when live. Maybe
only a junkie would've expected more..."
A big Felix kiss and clinch to our newest kid
off his block, BEA. Here's 'SOS' by Ecstasy of
Saint Theresa (free). " A great ambient track
and the excellent Bandulu remix will leave
ravers wondering when it will speed up and
start."
Love you all. Maybe. Tintin
.. And everything I'll ever be I've been . . .
