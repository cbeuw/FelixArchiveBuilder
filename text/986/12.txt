"ALIF L A M RAA. These are the
Verses of a Qur'an that makes
things clear.
"Again and again will those who
disbelieve wish that they had
bowed (to Allah's will) in Islam.
"Leave them alone,to enjoy (the
good things of this life) and to
please themselves: Let false Hope
amuse them; soon will knowledge
(undeceive them)."
