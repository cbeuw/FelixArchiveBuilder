Many congratulations to the lucky winners! We
had an enormous number of entrants to the com-
petition for which we are exceedingly grateful.
All were of an amazingly high standard, with
over 27 of the entrants getting less than 5 out of
the 216 clues wrong !
Could the winners please turn up in the Felix
Office at 1.15pm on Monday (25th) to receive
their prizes (please phone the office on ext 3515
if you cannot attend).
Many of the entrants slipped up on the same
clues (especially those that copied their
boyfriends). So for the benefit of the many we
decided to go through the two most common:
The first common error was on Day 12, 26
across:
26. Present an American soldier with a paper (4)
Many of you wrote 'GIVE'. The American
soldier being 'G.I.', and present meaning 'Give'.
For the actual answer this needed to be taken a
step further 'with a paper' referring to the
Financial Times, 'F.T.' so the 'present' took the
meaning 'GIFT' and this was the intended
answer.
Another whoopsie was on Day 10, 14 down:
14. Tense, but sounds successful (4)
The common mistake here was ' T A U T ' .
Tense meaning taut. The actual answer was
'PAST' since it sounds like 'passed' and hence
'sounds successful'. 'Tense', therefore, referred
to the past tense.
Another point that was hardly spotted, even
by some of the winners, was the appearance of
the 12 Days of Christmas in the relevant days of
the crossword. Hence on Day 7 were the words
'Swans' and 'Swimming'. We didn't inform you
of this beforehand because we thought that
doing so would make it too easy, but we at least
expected people to notice...ah well. We even had
some people comment that it was strange that
we had the words 'Drummers' and 'Drumming'
on the same level when they were so similar, but
for their own credibility these people shall
remain nameless.
Footnote: Look out for the crash-course in
how to solve cryptic crossword clues. It will be
starting next Friday and will lead up to the
Easter 3D (yes, 15x15x15) crossword in the last
issue of term.
