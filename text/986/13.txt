The Unknown Modigliani
The art gallery must be the quietest place on
earth. Strange really, we're all grown, sane
adults here, concentrating on carbon daubed
paper. It's like someone has died. Modigliani
did die of course, and in the best possible taste,
too. B y 1920 the great lover of 1884 was
wrecked with tuberculosis and he did other
things which did him no good: opium, alcohol
and hashish. His only lifetime exhibition was
closed down for indecency in 1917 and it didn't
sell anything anyway. The man had little going
for him. Even today his characteristic elongated,
stylised faces are only regarded as second rate.
If Modigliani could have attended his exhibi-
tion himself, a scene springs to my mind In
strides the drunken artist, joint in hand and dis-
reputable girlfriend struggling in behind on
twelve inch white stilettoes. There is a gasp
from the assembled serious art journalists as
Modig. clatters across to Brian Sewell, promptly
throws on the famous critic's shoes and then
laughes long and loud, haaahaaahaaa. The point
is he was not a serious artist in the way we
analyse him to be and we lose something by
that.
The exhibition itself is over long, consisting
of 240 sketches but, alas, only one oil and one
sculpture. The sketches themselves are there for
the delights of Modigliani PhD scholars but for
dull. I suppose the historical point of the work is
the developing maturing of his style and there is
some of this on show. A linkage to primitive art,
especially African and Cambodian, is one exam-
ple. Of more artistic interest is a room dedicated
to Caryatids, which are sculptural figures used
as columns. Here, at last, full bodies with a cer-
tain grace can be seen, over and above the two-
view mugshots which predom-inate elsewhere.
The exhibition was all collected by Dr Paul
Alexandre, who was Modigliani's patron during
the period 1906-1914. He saved most of the
sketches from the bin, as Modigliani generally
threw away everything he didn't consider good
enough. And the question remains, assuming
that Alexandre did the world a service, have the
Royal Academy done us a service putting on an
exhibition so heavily angled towards the histori-
an?

p.s. I think Brian Sewell is an astute art critic,
whatever that means. He only became my exam-
ple as presently he is (in)famous and was the
only person I recognised as being present during
the press showing.
