Mercury Tribute
BY JOE MCFADDEN
It was announced at a Union Exec-
utive Committee Meeting earlier
this week that the planned memorial
to the rock legend Freddie Mercury,
may now take the form of a plaque.
It was originally thought that a
statue of Freddie would be erected
in Beit Quad.
The idea for the memorial came
from Queen Productions, the
company representing the interests
of Queen, the group fronted by
Freddie until his death in November
1991 from AIDS.
Drinks
A new hot drinks machine has been
placed in the Union building foyer.
As well as offering tea and coffee
of varying strengths, there is hot
chocolate, vegetable soup and a
range of cold drinks all, at 20 pence.
One student was heard to
comment: "It may seem imposing,
but feel free to call it Eddie if it will
help you relax!"
Queen's guitarist Brian May
studied at Imperial College and the
band's first performance (without
Freddie Mercury) was in the Union
building. The company made an
informal application to Imperial
College for permission to place a
memorial on College land. They
were then asked to make a formal
approach to the College Estates
Manager, Ian Caldwell (Felix 982).
It is felt by some that a statue
may be inappropriate and an
alternative suggestion is that the
memorial may take the form of a
plaque instead.
Fears have been expressed that,
since no grave exists (Freddie was
cremated), fans will turn the
memorial into a shrine. Since the
anniversary of Freddie's death is
during the Autumn term, the fans
wishing to pay their respects may
cause disruption to College life;
there could be as many as a
thousand people. (Last year over a
thousand fans from all over Europe
gathered at a Queen fan club
convention).
Negotiations are continuing
between the College Estates
division and Queen Productions.
Bradford Revolt
Students at the University of
Bradford are expected to clash with
university security this week.
This results from student plans
to occupy the office of the
university Vice-Chancellor in
protest at government reforms. The
plan was passed as a motion by the
Student Union on Monday in
opposition to government policy on
Student Union reforms and grant
cuts.
The President of the Union is
said to have described the Vice-
Chancellor as "a scumbag, a
complete Thatcherite".
Officials at the university have
responded by attempting to seal off
offices. Senior officials, including
the Vice-Chancellor, are said to be
Crime
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Crime at Imperial College has
bucked the national trend by
decreasing.
Figures released by College
security this week show a
downward trend in incidences of
reported crime. The figures concern
the period up to the end of 1993.
In particular, thefts concerning
bicycles dropped to a total of 58.
This compares to the soaring
national crime rate figures
published by the government.
The vast majority of thefts
occurred during office hours on
weekdays, when the college is
'wide open'. Despite the figures,
College security are urging people
to protect their personal belongings.
Bicycles should be secured with
d-locks and coats, bags and
valuables should not be left lying
around. If you see anyone acting
suspiciously in the College, report
it to Security in the department or
telephone ext 4444.
There will be a full length
article on crime prevention in Felix
later this term.
