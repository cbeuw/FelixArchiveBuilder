Tae Kwondo Self Defence
Lessons For Women
A six week course in self defence for women
starts at the end of this month. The six week
course will be instructed by Theresa Thomas, a
qualified self defence teacher. She is fully
experienced in Tae Kwondo techniques, with a
3rd Dan Black Belt.
During the six week period, highly effective
methods of self defence will be taught. No
previous knowledge of martial arts or self
defence is needed and the course will be very
easy to master.
A l l lessons will be held in The Studio
(located in the Imperial College Sports Centre).
It is fully equipped with air conditioning and a
spring loaded floor so it is an ideal environment
in which to learn self defence.
To book this course, go along to the Sports
Centre with the enrolment fee. All bookings are
confirmed once payment has been received and
refunds will not be given, except at the
discretion of the manager. There are only fifteen
places available, so if you are interested it is
imperative that you book early to avoid
disappointment.
