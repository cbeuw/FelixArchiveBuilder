students charter Imperial in the
proposals year 2000
Due to the current governments
wish to formalise the position of
Student Unions, a Student's
Charter is being drafted. Several
versions are being suggested, but
as yet, the only available is that
produced by the Adam Smith
Institute, a well known right wing
organisation. The report states that
the powers of Trade Unions have
been severely curtailed in the past
ten years and, assuming that this
was 'no bad thing', uses this
assumption to suggest the same
thing occur with respect to student
unions.
Commenting that although the
document was only one of many
possible drafts, Chris Davidson,
ICU President, said 'A lot of
things I found interesting and a lot
of things made my blood boil'. He
highlighted two possibilities
The name of the Union Snack Bar
may be changed to Leonardo's.
The proposals were put forward as
part of the refurbishment of the
Bar taking place over the summer.
Chris Davidson ICU President
mentioned in the document, and
how they affected Imperial College
Union. Firstly he feared that the
Union's Outlets; the bookstore, bar
and snack bar would be taken
from Union control, and given
over to college. This, he said,
would be a bad financial move for
all concerned, declaring his belief
that the Union could run the bar
and snack bar far better.
The second question of a
possible voluntary membership,
the President dismissed,
commenting that, given the three
years he estimated it would take
the government to prepare the
charter would be sufficient time to
prepare. He ended saying, 'I think
that with college's help and with
the help of industry... we could
survive it'
said that the new-look Bar needed
a name and that Leonardo's was
one of the suggestions. Any further
suggestions should be submitted to
Rick Bilby, ICU Deputy President.
In August 1991. Sir Norman
Foster and Partners were appointed
as consultant architects to Imperial
College. They were asked to
prepare a plan which would serve
as a basis for a College Estates
D e v e l o p m e n t Plan. T h i s
Masterplan concentrates on three
areas of the College: the academic
site (bounded by Queensgate.
Exhibition Road. Prince Consort
Road and the Science Museum).
Beit Quadrangle and Princes

The summer redevelopment of the
Concert Hall to include raked
seating has been put in doubt,
following concerns about the
strength of the sprung floor.
The floor in the Concert Hall is
supported by steel beams that run
across the building. Following
uncertainty over their strength and
size, another survey will have to
be taken to establish whether the
floor can support the raked
seating. Consulting engineers,
recommended by College, are at
present not satisfied that the beams
puts forward a number of
proposals which can be built on, to
provide a physical environment
suitable for Imperial College's
needs. The main aims are to give
a more pleasing appearance, with
more open spaces and lower
effective building heights; to
improve the pedestrian access by
relocating cars below constructed
pedestrian walkways and to utilise
the facilities and space available to
its maximum potential, allowing
for expansion of the College in
future years.
are strong enough.
The more detailed survey will
result in the Union Concert Hall
being closed for at least a week,
and will establish whether the
Concert Hall will be able to hold
the seating and the cost of any
restructuring that may be needed.
Chris Davidson ICU President
said that there was 'no way that
the Concert Hall would be ready
for the beginning of term". Mr
Davidson hoped that the seating
could be installed during the first
few weeks of term.

Sabbaticals asked to leave
Three Imperial College Union
elected representatives were
banned from the University of
London Union (ULU) training
course at Wye College on
Saturday 18th of July. The ban
was enforced because the three,
Chris Davidson (ICU President),
Rick Bilby (ICU Deputy President)
and Marc Swan (St Mary's
President) failed to evacuate the
building they were staying in
during a fire alarm.
The U L U training course is
organised annually for all new
senior officers of U L U constituent
colleges. Two other ICU officers
also attended the course: Dominic
Wilkinson (Honorary Secretary)
and Jonty Beavan (Felix Editor)
who decided to leave with their
colleagues.
At 4 am on the Saturday morning
the fire alarm was activated and
the building evacuated. Following
a roll call, it was found that Chris
Davidson. Rick Bilby, Marc Swan
and Tarn Lamb (last year's U L U
Vice President, finance and
Welfare), were still in the building.
When the Fire Brigade arrived to
search the building, they found the
missing sabbaticals asleep in their
rooms.
The following morning, Kate
Steele, U L U Research and
Training Manager, told Chris
Davidson, Rick Bilby and Marc
Swan, that they had to leave the
Wye College accommodation. The
Warden of the accommodation,
Mrs Simmons, later stated that
'anyone who failed to leave the
building for a fire alarm was asked
to leave.' The four sabbaticals had
agreed earlier that morning that if
one of them were banned they
would all leave. This they
promptly did.
During the night damage had also
occurred in the Hall of residence.
Mrs Simmons, commented that
during the evening a condom
machine and a table had been
broken. Also a toilet roll had been
forced into a tampon incinerator
which had subsequently triggered
the fire alarms.
Mrs Simmons continued that 'ULU
courses would not be held at Wye
College again'. Mark Samuals
(ULU President) did not comment
on this but emphasised that 'IC
sabbaticals have not been banned
from future courses' and that he
personally found the course
'excellent'.
Commenting earlier this week,
Chris Davidson said that he was a
very 'heavy sleeper'. However,
other course delegates reported
that the alarm was 'bloody loud'.
The course cost IC Union £ 9 0 tor
each sabbatical. Last year all of
the Union office sabbaticals went
on the course. Zoe Hellinger,
outgoing ICU President who went
on the course last year, said that 'it
was very useful for networking'.
Kate Steele and Mrs Simmons
could not be reached yesterday to
explain why Tarn Lamb, who also
failed to leave the building during
the fire alarm, was not asked to
leave the course.
