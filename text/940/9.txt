M y C o u s i n Vinny
If you've just been arrested for
murder in Alabama, you want a top
attorney to save you from a hair
raising shock. Bill and Stan, two
students on a tour of America, get
Vinny. Vinny (Joe Pesci) hasn't
actually taken a case to court
before. In fact he's only been in the
business for six weeks, but he's
Bill's cousin and will take the case
for free.
The case against Bill and Stan is
frighteningly secure. After a
shooting in a grocery store, two
boys who match Bill and Stan's
description are seen racing off in a
car that matches theirs perfectly.
Only the murder weapon is missing,
but that won't stop Trotter (Lane
Smith), the prosecuting attorney
from sending the two boys to the
chair.
Vinny's struggle with courtroom
procedures and his quest to get a
decent night's sleep is very funny
and captivating. Good fun.

Beauty a n d the Beast
One does not expect depth in an
animated Disney film, and
following the tenet that to be
forewarned is to be forearmed, I
managed to expect nothing but
schmaltzy tears and predictable
morals, and thus I did enjoy it. The
film conforms to all the Disney
formulae - facile and effective
characteristion, immediately
placing the Goodies, the Baddies,
the Amusing Incidental Characters
and the Tragic Figure. All set in an
over-the-top rustic Bavarian
countryside. The expected and
appealingly slapdash visual humour
is there as well as the subtler jokes
for the grownups like, for instance,
the rather bittersweet advice given
to the wooing Beast of the title on
how to win a woman; 'give her
things like flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to
keep....'
A truly stunning piece of
animation is a computer-generated
swoop around a circular ballroom
during a particularly smoochy bit of
romanticism. If you want a
superficially amusing and attractive
way to spend some time, this is for
you. We all know what Disney
films are like - don't convince
yourself of anything different and
you will enjoy this film. It's one of
Disney's better and it's great fun.

Catwoman: they shall have nought
B a t m a n Returns
So finally, The Bat Returns, and
with him he brings The Cat and The
Penguin. Michael Keaton, Michelle
Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito star, as
if you didn't know. I got what I
expected with this movie: Moody
Blue gothic sets, atmospheric
music, action filled scenes
containing a modicum of violence
and cartoon characters in the flesh;
Batman and his gadgetry,
Catwoman and her 'charisma' and
Penguin with his villainy,- mind
you, I didn't expect such vileness
to go along with it. So why do I
but these my work clothes..
think it's crap? Well, here goes.
Somehow, though I didn't think
it such a hard task, the makers of
this film did not manage to
characterize, explore or give any
emotive impact to the three lead
characters. The token storyline jolts
along with dodgy motivations for all
three. Batman seemed rather
insignificant against Catwoman's
'S + M ' - style retribution for her
past life of plainness, drudgery and
oppression. Why, I ask myself, do
they bother getting an actor for the
part of Penguin, let alone a 'name'?
Danny DeVito was so plasticised
and distorted in his part that it
would be near impossible for you
to get a taste of his talent. The script
was tacky and banal, The Cat;-
'Life's a bitch, now so am I'. Pass
the sick bag says I. How can so
much money be spent on a film with
the final cut having such bad sound
quality? All these questions remain.
Any answers welcomed, on the

Still, if I were you reading this,
I'd go to see it anyway, cos I love
the hype, I love the look and I fancy
Batman and Pfeiffer.
