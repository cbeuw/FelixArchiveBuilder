Rick's Bit A Sober Thought
Well, since we four incoming
sabbaticals began the handover
period, I think I speak for us all
when I say that we have been made
to feel very much at home by the
friendliness—and patience!—of the
Union staff, and outgoing
sabbaticals. I personally have spent
most of my time during the last
three weeks familiarising myself
with as many aspects of the job as
possible. This has included meeting
most of the college staff I will be
liaising with, as well as some of the
governors. We have also had some
formal training sessions involving
team-building exercises and the
like.
I have already begun negotiations
with regard to the issue of Union
cards next term. Initially, it was
proposed to combine Union and
library cards with the new college
security pass. After discussions
with Keith Reynolds, Head of
Security, Peter Mee, the Registrar
and other interested parties this was
deemed unfeasible. I shall
endeavour to explain the reason.
The current Union card includes a
grid of punchable spaces numbered
l to 6 so Union officials may punch
a given number and thereby know
whether the holder has voted in an
election or received a particular
freebie. The security pass lasts the
duration of the student's stay at
College. The proposed combined
card would therefore require up to
twenty-four holes. This would leave
the final year student with a card
resembling something like a
colander! To resolve this problem,
I shall be liaising with Keith
Reynolds throughout the year and
I hope to have an electronic
'punching' system ready for the
1993 intake.
Remember—the Union office is
open throughout the summer, so
don't hesitate to pop in if you think
we can help you with anything!
See you next time.
Rick.

As you read this I will be enjoying
the last day of training I will get
before the buck stops with me rather
than with Zoe. This said, I would
like to thank Zoe for training me to
become the type of mental wreck
that the job demands. In all
seriousness, I am inheriting a very
healthy ship which I look forward
to steering through the minefield of
the year ahead, I only hope that I
can do as good a job as my
predecessor has. • .'•
To the business in hand. Hello to
the postgrads reading this—I just
want to assure you that I have been
devoting a bit of time to finding a
Postgraduate Affairs Officer who
will be able to inject some drive and
conscientiousness into what is a
very difficult job, no names yet, but
watch this space.
Finally I would like to remind
you that my door is always open
and that you are my boss, so please
come in and see me with any
suggestions, criticisms or problems
that you might have.
Cheers,
Chris.
T h e N e w - l o o k Union S n a c k Bar
By the beginning of next term the facelift of the Union Snack Bar and Ents lounge will be complete. Pictured
above are the plans for the new Snack Bar. The Ents. Lxjunge is being redesigned to look 'more like a night
club' in the words of incoming Deputy President Rick Bilby.
Dominic's Fairytale
Once upon a time there was a bar.
Now not many people seemed to
know about it and it didn't have
many friends but nonetheless it was
quite a happy little thing, in its own
shoe-boxy sort of a way.
But even so the bar couldn't help
feeling a little bit sad and left out
and lonely in its little leafy corner.
You see, the bar was funny looking.
This wasn't the bar's fault, oh no,
it just seemed to have grown up that
way.
Cruel, nasty, unkind boys and
girls who didn't understand about
Bars would come up to it and laugh
and say wicked things.
'You've only got a widgy little
serving area', they would say.
'You're a real rectangle'.
'Eurgh, just look at the state of
your yucky blue tables and chairs'.
You can imagine how unwanted
and dejected the bar felt. People
only seemed to be interested in it
when they could bump into its
furniture or dance around in its
friend the disco until two o'clock in
the morning.
Then one day some kind, special
people who could see beyond the
bar's ugly exterior into its warm
and loving heart said to it,' Here's
lots of money, go and get yourself
a serious face-lift, because all the
clever bars know that if you're not
attractive, curvaceous and desirable
then no-one will want to use you'.
Now the bar knew that deep
down it was special anyway but
could see from reading its bar
magazines that if it didn't look good
it would never be really popular.
Sad, but that's a consumerist society
for you.
So in the end, after several weeks
work with a chisel and a
screwdriver when nobody was
looking, the Bar transformed itself
from a dull stone into a shining
jewel and was really popular and
everything else...
This isn't a complete fairytale
because over the next few weeks the
Union Lounge Bar is about to be
transformed with the installation of
a new 70 foot bar, a raised dais, an
extended serving area etc that will
make the bar as it is,
unrecognisable.
In conjunction with a full weekly
Union events programme and a
general publicity campaign to
increase its awareness, the Students'
Union will hopefully become the
centre of student social life within
Imperial as it rightfully should be.
If anyone has any comments or
suggestions about the bar, events or
anything else then please come and
see me. You will be made all the
more welcome if you also have
some cigarettes with you.
Tatty bye.
Dominic.
