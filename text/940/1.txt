Stanhope in trouble
as Furse bid fails
One of the companies connected
with members of the Imperial
College Board of Governors is
reported to be in severe financial
difficulties as a result of the crash
of Olympia and York, (O&Y), the
Canary Wharf developers.
Stuart Lipton, a member of the
Board of Governors, Chairman of
the Estates Committee, and a
member of the Board of Directors,
is also the Chief Executive of
Stanhope Properties. Mr Lipton
refused to comment to iCNN on
the reports that shares in Stanhope
were used as security by O & Y to
guarantee the repayment of O&Y's
loans.
The share dealing was first
reported in the Independent on
Sunday on the 5th July. According
to business correspondent, Gail
Counsel, Olympia and York
purchased 32.6% of Stanhope's
shares in 1988, at a cost of £137
million. When Olympia & York
filed for bankruptcy in May of this
year, these shares only had a
projected value of £9.2 million.
The Independent also reported that
Stanhope's bankers are looking at
possible ways of restructuring the
company's finances and that
Stanhope may face 'concerted
action' from the banks.
Mr Lipton was also one of several
governors considering the purchase
of Furse House, on Queen's Gate
Terrace, a property owned by
Stanhope Properties. /CNN has
learned that the College has
decided not to purchase the former
Ministry of Defense Hostel, which
could have housed up to 200
students. The plan to purchase
Furse House has been seen to be
closely linked to the soon to be
retiring Rector, Sir Eric Ash.
Speaking to iCNN in June, Sir
Eric said that he 'would give his
Party. The first draft of the report,
published last term, was roundly
criticised, with several pages of
corrections and errata submitted in
response. In particular the response
of wardens to the report angered
the Rector, who said that he was
'cold with fury'. The rector has
himself caused consternation with
his letter to Felix in issue 939,
denying that he used that particular
phrase. Sir Eric's denial has been
flatly contradicted by three
independent sources, who told
iCNN that they heard the Rector
use this phrase when referring to
the warden's response to the
Working Party report. The Rector
is now believed to be restoring
relations with College Managing
Director, Angus Fraser, and
Estates Director, Gordon Marshall.
The relationship between these
three senior College administrators
was damaged by the recent
management rows over the
Working Party report, and the
plans to buy Furse House,
right arm' to buy the hostel,
though he did add that the deficit
on the Estates account could not
be extended beyond its current two
million pound level. Sir Eric
recently hosted a reception for
college alumni, who were being
targeted for donations towards the
cost of the property. Estates
sources said that the College
would have had to have raised
three million pounds to pay for the
hostel.
The decision not to buy Furse
House has given the Estates
Division time to further
contemplate the report from the
Residences Strategy Working
Fire in Clayponds
The Creda washing machine that caught fire in Clayponds.
Every house in the estate has the benefit of one.
A fire broke out in a washing
machine in Imperial College's
Clayponds estate at the end of
term. The Creda washing machine
is the second on the Estate to have
burst into flames this summer.
The occupants of the house woke
to find the house filled with 'thick
black smoke'. As there are no
internal phones in Clayponds the
fire brigade had to be called from
a nearby phone box. A neighbour,
Richard Eyers put the electrical
fire out with the water fire
extinguisher that was present in
the house as there were no foam
fire extinguishers present in the
building.
