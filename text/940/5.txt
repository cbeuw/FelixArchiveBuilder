Southern Ireland is again in turmoil, after the rapist of a 17 year old
girl escapes punishment. Declan Curry reports on the victims story.
Does Rape really pay?
In the early hours of 1st January,
1992, Lavinia Kerwick was raped.
Her rapist was her boyfriend,
William Conry. Both were 17 years
old. and Conry was walking
Lavinia home after a New Year's
Eve disco. In July, Conry pleaded
guilty to rape at Dublin's Central
Criminal Court. He was released by
the judge, who imposed a one year
suspended sentence.
Lavinia Kerwick had been
described as a 'happy go lucky'
teenager. In employment since
leaving school, she was interested
in sport, and excelled in martial
arts. A judo certificate hangs from
a wall in her house. T was right up
to one level below the black belt,'
she says. She also had a 'steady'
boyfriend. She and William Conry
had been going out together for five
months before he raped her.
She met Conry at the disco, and
he insisted on walking her home
afterwards. At the trial, defense
counsel said that Conry, who had
been drinking, took Kerwick past a
disused mill beside the River Nore
in County Kilkenny. Conry then
placed his jacket on the ground for
what counsel called a 'good court',
that is physical intercourse. Conry
then went on to rape Kerwick,
disregarding her screams.
After the crime, Lavinia went to
visit a doctor. 'When she examined
me, she found bruises everywhere,
on my back, on my face, on my
private parts,' Lavinia says. She
also says that Conry tried to
dissuade her from reporting the
crime. Conry beat her, and said he
wanted rights to see the baby if she
became pregnant as a result of the
rape. Conry then changed his mind,
and said he wanted Lavinia to go to
England for an abortion.
'My life was totally turned upside
down.' Lavinia says. 'On New
Year's Eve, I lost my virginity and
everything else that I valued.'
Since she was raped, Lavinia
Kerwick lost three and a half stone
in weight. She has difficulty
sleeping, and when she does sleep
she has recurring nightmares about
her experiences. 'My life was
shattered to pieces,' she said. T am
still a prisoner in my own house
She has not gone outside the door
of her home since January. 'When
I had to go to the doctor the other
day, a ban garda (Irish woman
police constable) had to come and
collect me and bring me home
afterwards.'
T took an overdose at the end of
January. I just felt that nothing was
going to be done and I just felt so
dirty and so guilty that I just
couldn't go on with life anymore.
He (Conry) said that if I brought the
case to court, he would walk free.'
Local gardai (Irish police)
predicted that Conry 'would be put
away for 10 to 15 years.' A police
superintendent, shocked by the
case, visited Lavinia at home and
said Conry would be jailed for at
least 15 years, possibly 20. 'The
thing that kept me going during the
last seven months was the
knowledge that he would be
sentenced to jail', she said.
The case came to court on 15th
July. Conry was represented by
defense counsel Michael
McDowell. Lavinia Kerwick was
represented by the state, with
Michael Feehan prosecuting.
Sergeant John Tuohy, of
Kilkenny Gardai, told M r Feehan
that Lavinia Kerwick's mother
complained to the Gardai about the
rape. Sergeant Tuohy then visited
Conry, who readily admitted the
rape and made a statement.
The sergeant described Conry, an
apprentice carpenter, as a member
of a very respectable farming
family. He added that Conry's 'only
fault was that he had been drinking
too much at times.'
The rapist's father told the court
that he and his family were
'shocked and horrified' by what had
happened. The defense counsel, Mr
McDowell, pleaded for 'as much
mercy as the law allows,' and
apologised on Conry's behalf, for
an 'atrocious, inexcusible and
unjustified attack.' M r McDowell
said that Conry had 'given in to his
strong sexual impulse without any
forethought. He knew almost
immediately he had done her a very
grave wrong.'
Ironically, M r McDowell
described the rapist in the same
terms as Lavinia Kerwick had
earlier been described, as a 'happy
go lucky' teenager. M r McDowell
said that Conry was an immature 17
year old at the time of the offence.
'He had been scarsely more than a
boy'.
In summing up, the judge, M r
Feargus Flood, told Conry that he
was giving him a chance as 'a
human being', and was adjourning
sentence for one year. The judge
warned Conry that if he
transgressed in any way, even by
'simple drunkenness' or disorderly
behaviour, Conry would be jailed
for 10 years.
Conry was also ordered to report
regularly to the probation service
and to abide by the directions of his
psychiatrist. Conry was warned to
keep away from Lavinia Kerwick,
and then walked free from court.
Lavinia Kerwick was in court
throughout the hearing, flanked by
her mother and a police officer.
During the judge's summing up,
she broked down and wept bitterly.
She was assisted from the court, and
repeatedly screamed, 'he got away
with it, he got away with it.' The
following day, she revealed her
identity and told the Irish nation of
her story on a radio phone-in
programme.
T went public to try and get some
justice for myself and to make sure
that something like this never
happens again,' she said after the
programme. T felt that after coming
so far and being let down by the
whole justice system that I should
never have reported it in the first
place. If one of my friends was
raped, I would say she would be
wasting her time reporting it. The
man who raped her could easily get
away.'
