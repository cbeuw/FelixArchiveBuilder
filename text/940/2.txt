A New Rector for Imperial College
Professor Sir Ronald Oxburgh was
appointed Rector of Imperial
College on 17th July 1992:'The
appointment was formally accepted
at a meeting of the Governing Body
held on the same day.
An announcement on the
appointment of the new Rector had
been expected on 26th June, but
was delayed without explanation
until during the Summer vacation.
It has been generally rumoured that
the delay was caused by the
reluctance of Sir Ronald to take up
the position.
The post of Rector officially
becomes vacant on lst September
1993. when Sir Eric Ash, the
present Rector, retires. This allows
Sir Ronald time to prepare for the
responsibilities of the Rectorship of
Imperial College.
Born on 2nd November 1934,
Professor Sir Ronald Oxburgh is
married with three children. He has
distinguished himself on both the
academic and administrative sides
of science and education, being a
Geology graduate from University
College, Oxford, and elected to the
Fellowship of the Royal Society in
1978.
In 1978 Professor Oxburgh was
awarded the Professorship of
Mineralogy and Petrology at
Cambridge University and went on
to become Head of the Department
of Earth Sciences in 1980. During
the 1980s, Ronald'Oxburgh became
President of Queens College,
Cambridge, and received a visiting
Professorship of Cornell University
in 1986.
A major change in direction of
Professor Oxburgh's career took
place in 1988, when he was
appointed Chief Scientific Advisor
to the Ministry of Defence. Since
then, he has held numerous
administrative posts including
membership of the Science and
Engineering Research Council and
Assessor to the Advisory Board for
the Research Councils and the
Advisory Council for Science and
Technology.
The Chairman of the Governors
Sir Frank Cooper, retired Defence
Chief of Staff, said 'Imperial
College is delighted that Sir Ronald
Oxburgh will become the new
Rector'. This view is reflected by
members of the college's academic
staff who are optimistic that Sir
Ronald will provide the balance
between academic and financial
concerns.

Loan rates Down
Europe
Mr Nigel Forman, the Further
and Higher Education Minister,
speaking at the annual conference
of the U K Council for Overseas
Student Affairs, said that Higher
Education should become more
international. He continued by
saying that he expected the number
of students coming to the U K to
study to continue to increase,
particularly European Community
students. Mr Forman hoped to see
more students travelling abroad to
study. He also expressed his desire
that student mobility schemes
within the European Community
would continue to prosper.
The UK is highly involved in the
Erasmus scheme, the EC's
foremost student mobility
programme, Imperial College itself
has participants in the scheme in
almost every department. In
1990-1991, movement into and out
of the UK accounted for 40% of all
the Erasmus budget.
The indexation rate or interest rate
charged on student loans for the
coming year has been set at 3.9 per
cent. This is the lowest rate since
student loans began, and represents
a charge of £32 a year on repayment
any full student loan taken out in
1992/93.
In 1991 when the student loan
scheme started the Indexation rate
has been as high as 9.8%. Because
the rate is linked to inflation the
Indexation rate has been fallen to its
lowest point this year.
On 9th July, a quarter of a million
students had taken out student
loans, with a total of over £132
million. This compares with around
180,000 students who took out
loans worth £70 million during the
1992/93.
The maximum value of student
loans taken out this year has also
been announced. For students
studying in London next year, they
are as follows:
Students away from home:
Full Year £830
Final Year £605
Students at Home:
Full Year £570
Final Year £415
