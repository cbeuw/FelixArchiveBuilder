As Felix Editor, it is traditional to
spend most of my time criticising
others. In particular, the antics of
my fellow sabbaticals come under
the most severe criticism.
Unfortunately this issue of Felix
will come to you with the help of
the Union office laser printer, so it
would be a little hypocritical to be
too unpleasant.
Even so, this rather delayed copy
of Felix contains some information
that the Union Office would rather
it didn't. Here, I believe lies the
traditional antagonism between
Felix and the Union. We both
represent students, but in such a
way that'our goals often collide.
I really believe that this year is
different. Having been on more
management and training courses
with the Union sabbs, than it is
right for a human to endure, my
attitude to the Union Office has
changed. I now regard 'them
upstairs' as comrades in arms in a
harsh world were the future of
student union is under threat. In
return, those high up in the Union
also have a respect for, what I do
and the right 1 have to do it,
without any interference.
Unfortunately this newfound spirit
of cooperation has a down side.
The events at Wye College during
the U L U training, put me in the
position of reporting events, that
criticised people, I had been trying
to build a working relationship
with. Upon showing reluctance to
spread these revelations in 6ft high
letters across the front page of
Felix, my position was put under
extreme pressure and I haven't
even started the job yet!
Today, Adam Harrington last years
Felix Editor will be leaving for the
rest of the world. All the Office
wish him the best of luck for the
however much of his life he has
left. He warned me about this job,
but I didn't listen, may he be left
in a corner to cackle in peace.
This issue of Felix was brought to
Stream of Consciousness
Lard. What does lard suggest to
you? As one half of the half-fat to
flour relationship of Shortcrust
Pastry, lard is at the hub of the
U.K.'s pie construction activities,
but to such figures as Harry
Enfield, Vic Reeves and large
female funster, Jo Brand, lard is
the last cornerstone of the great
british comedy icon.
It's been a long time since Ben
Elton's humour was funny,
depending as it did on a tongue-in-
cheek appraisal of the 70's sitcom,
with lots of 'whoops! Mrs
Scatology, my underpants have
fallen in the vicar's tea', and other
such gems. Besides, he'd always
cloak his humour with some
'serious message', which, for a
comedian, is an entirely stupid
thing to do. Great idea, Ben, poke
fun at the human condition, say
'our expectations are too high; let's
be honest', and make yourself
redundant in the process. What a
star. Even his great student
Anarcho-Icons 'the Young Ones',
and the rubbery, histrionic
histories of 'Blackadder' relied too
much on the 'spoof, you see. No-
one laughs at the toilet anymore,
the fart has wafted away with a
whimper, and bottoms have lost
their cheekiness. There's still much
mirth in the willy, but this won't

sincerely thank all of them for

But for lard, the future looks
bleak; in five years' time, humour

There will always be those people
who will suggest that it's humour
exists in the fact that it is
completely unfunny, but they're
wankers, and not worth the time of
day, which on our New Lard
Clock is accurate at least twice a
day. However, the day will come
when lard is a mere substance to
be utilised for great big fry-ups
and general food preparation, and
I for one will mourn it's passing;
while it's still with us, let's
celebrate lard!

Another Union year comes to an
end. another starts. This year's
sabbaticals have spent July winding
down. Supposedly they have been
training up their successors in how
to do their jobs. Potentially a
difficult task, when some of them
only found out quite recently what
they were supposed to be doing.
Zoe, one of this year's more
visible sabbaticals is on her new
white bike and off to find a job.
Adam, leaves the Felix Office for
the last time and heads off around
the world. Meanwhile Steve and
Jonathan return to the real world
where they carry on with their
degrees.
So what of next years sabbaticals?
They have already got off to an
impressive start. Their U L U
training at Wye college lasted less
than 24 hours before they were
kicked out. Why? Well, after a free
bar all Friday evening the drinking
and singing continued late into the
night. The high spirits continued,
with doors being kicked and people
woken up until 2am when the
shinanigans finally ended.
By 4am a smouldering toilet roll
in the tampon incinerator had set off
the fire alarms, which in their
alcohol induced sleep, several of
our sabbaticals slept through. The
warden decided that she didn't want
people who slept through fire
alarms in the hall, and they were
asked to leave.
The ensuing cover up was quite
impressive. The basic skills of team
building, networking and media
communication interfacing, that the
course was going to teach, seemed
to have already been learnt by all
the sabbaticals. When they next
appeared in the Union Bar, the
general 'no comment' that might be
used to cover these situations was
replaced with 'sorry its a personnel
matter and I can't talk about it'. It
took over a week before the wall
started to crumble, and even then
it remained an obstacle.
Have the incoming sabbaticals
learnt anything from this
unfortunate incident? Hopefully
yes. ICU needs a year of strong
leadership coupled with all the
student officers and staff working
as a team. At the moment they seem
to be providing a lot of the former,
and only a little of the latter, but
admittedly this is hard to build over
the summer. The fact that there are
fresh ideas coming out of the Union
Office is good, but these ideas
should be discussed, rather than
being implemented over the
summer. But at least there are new
ideas.
It seems as though the four
sabbaticals are working well
together, although they have very
different responsibilities and duties.
Hopefully this will continue and we
will have a storming year.
