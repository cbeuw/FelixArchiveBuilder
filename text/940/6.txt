I stepped out from the gaudy auto
rickshaw onto the steps of Delhi
Inter State Bus Terminal. The
midday sun filtered down through
the dusty sky and played rather
gingerly over the abrupt grey angles
of the station building. It towered
above me, an enthusiastically huge
piece of concrete cubism, around
which people, rickshaws and cows
swirled in an endless tumbling sea
of colour and noise.
The rickshaw driver thoughtfully
kicked my bags out onto the floor
where they landed with a
satisfyingly dusty 'wumph'. He
then proceeded to ask for twice the
fare that we had agreed back at my
hotel. When I protested he
explained that this was an extra
charge because we had stopped
along the way. I was taken aback.
The only reason we had stopped
was because he ran somebody over.
The driver seemed convinced that
I should pay more for this extra
service despite the fact that, through
no fault of his own, an old man
somewhere between Connaught
Place and New Delhi now bore an
indelible impression of the front of
our auto rickshaw on his buttocks.
I gave him the original fare and
walked off with my bags, leaving
him yelling on the steps.
The inside of the bus terminal
was much less crowded than
outside. Despite the cavernous
interior there was something about
it that suggested people were an
unwelcome intrusion.
The walls were lined with little
ticket booths where bored ticket
sellers sat drinking tea. A few blue
plastic chairs were scattered over
the dusty concrete floor as a kind
of absent minded concession to the
fact that this building was actually
meant to be used by human beings.
I followed the signs down a
curling concrete ramp to the buses
themselves. The main concourse
was crowded with food stalls. I

bought some samosas in a little
disposable bowl made from pressed
leaves and elbowed my way
towards the buses.
My bus was waiting with the
engine running. It was a relaxing
sky blue colour with several deep
silver wheals running down the left
hand side. The word 'luxury' had
been painted in red above the
windscreen.

The driver's mate painstakingly
stowed my luggage in the boot and
gave me a little red tab so that I
could reclaim it at the end of my
journey.
I walked around the side of the
bus to board and had just reached
up to turn the door handle when the
door whipped open by itself. A thin
man in a tight brown suit fell
heavily out of the bus and landed
on his back in front of me. For a
second we looked at each other but
before I could say or do anything
he leapt up, brushed himself down
and climbed back onto the bus.
I hesitated momentarily then
followed him up the steps. Once
inside I found myself in almost
complete darkness. The only
illumination came from the
fractionally open door. The drivers
compartment at the front was
partitioned off and all of the
windows were heavily curtained.
When I had eventually groped my
way to my seat I realised that the
curtains had also been securely
screwed to the window frames.
I sat in the dark and felt the gentle
throb of the engine under my feet.
Gradually the bus filled up and I
counted at least seven people walk
down the aisle and disappear into
the driver's compartment. Another
five minutes passed and I heard the
drivers door slam shut. He revved
the engine and we reversed out
from our parking bay and nosed
into the Delhi afternoon traffic.
By the time we had eventually
escaped the grasping clutches of
Delhi's road system and were in
open country I had begun to nod off
in the darkness and was looking
forward to a peaceful sleep for the
next four hours. Sadly it was not to
be.
The drivers compartment door
flapped open intermittently and
inside I could see compact mass of
people engaged in what appeared to
be a party. A crate of beer was
partially visible behind the door
which the little fat man abruptly
disappeared through when he had
finished his fiddling. It slammed
and locked behind him and the
strange bacchanalian world which
seemed to have developed in the
driver's cab disappeared from view.
With a flash it dawned on me
what he had been doing. The
realisation ran through me
accompanied by a wave of cold
sweat. I considered hurling myself
out into the traffic to forestall the
inevitable torture. I was on a video
bus.
The two words 'video bus' are
enough to instil at least a sense of
foreboding into even the most
hardened traveller on the sub
continent. The main reason for this
is that all Indian stereos and videos
can seemingly only be played at
maximum volume and maximum

treble. The result of this is the aural
equivalent fo having kitting needles
pushed into your ears. Prolonged
exposure can cause deafness,
bleeding from the ears and, on very
long journeys, I am sure death is a
possibility, if not a merciful release.
I searched frantically through my
day pack for my ear plugs until I
remembered wrapping them up in
my socks which were neatly packed
away in the boot. I sat back and
resigned myself to my fate.
The screen blinked alive and the
film began. I thanked the powers
above that the speaker over my seat
wasn't working but my attention
was drawn irresistably towards the
screen.
The film was in Hindi but despite
my total lack of knowledge of the
language it was pretty obvious that
the story was set somewhere deep
in the 1970s.
A handsome Indian college
student (whose name could only
have been the Hindi equivalent of
Kevin) sporting a wonderful
polyester safari suit falls in love
with a beautiful Indian girl in blue
hot pants. They begin the perfect
romance. There follows much
running about in the snow, walking
hand in hand through delightful
forest glades and disappearing into
golden sunsets in a fluster of Cuban
heels and cheesecloth shirts.
They get married and appear to
have the perfect marriage as well
and still have plenty of time to run
about in the snow etc. Eventually
though for some reason things turn
sour and the wife returns to her
parents and tries to shoot herself.
Her father grabs the gun and she
collapses into a faint.
The next scene shows her parents
sitting facing a doctor in his
surgery. He is wearing a white coat
and has a stethoscope in his ears for
no apparent reason. He removes it
for dramatic effect and the music
moves up a gear. He gives them
some apparently shocking news and
there follows several minutes of
rapid close ups of the parents
shocked faces. I think their daughter
was pregnant.
A little later Kevin pays them a
visit to apologise and ask for his
wife back as he has no one to iron
his flared trousers. He is told that
she is dead. Extremely dramatic
music fills the bus and we are
treated to a bonanza of close ups of
shocked faces, some of which don't
appear to have anything to do with
the film.
Kevin goes mad and runs away.
Time passes and we see him
wandering about with a dirty beard
and wearing tattered flares and a
grubby old trench coat.
More passing years are signified
by all of the actors, even the
children, having grey streaks in
their hair and eventually Kevin goes

back home. He gets severely beaten
up by the new owner of his house
who is understandably distressed at
finding a tramp in his living room.
After a fashion he is recognised
and told that his wife didn't really
die. The ensuing flood of dramatic
music was too much. The man
sitting next to me threw up quite
matter of factly into a paper bag and

carried on watching.
The camera goes mad and
dramatically zooms in on
everything, anguished faces, old
black and white wedding photos,
bookshelves, tables and the doctor
taking the stethoscope out of his
ears.
It transpires that his wife had a
daughter by him and this daughter
is coincidentally getting married
that very night.
We cut to an Indian wedding
scene of bright lights and dancing
people. Kevin is hiding in the
bushes and catches a glimpse of his
wife. The music by now had got so
dramatic that the woman across the
aisle from me was crying.
Suddenly fire breaks out in the
wedding tents and people run
around in panic. Kevin sees his wife
about to be flattened by a falling
beam and makes the supreme
sacrifice of pushing her out of the
way and getting flattened himself.
The fires are extinguished and the
wedding guests gather in a hushed
circle around the motionless Kevin.
His eyes half open and it is clear that
he is on his last legs. In that instant
his wife recognises him and gasps
in astonishment. Kevin reaches
towards her with imploring fingers
and with his dying breath says
something so moving that the
accompanying music transcends the
human capacity for drama. As
Kevin's limp arm falls to the
ground, the film ends.
The man sitting next to me looked
across.
'You liked the film?'
Uncertain of what to say I said
'Yes. it was very good."
He didn't have time to reply
before he was forced to turn back
to his sick bag and throw up again.
The rest of the journey was rather
an anticlimax. In fact, the rest of my
life probably will be.
