Patriot G a m e s
Whilst on a holiday in England, ex
CIA agent Jack Ryan (Harrison
Ford) witnesses an assassination
attempt on the Royal Family. His
quick actions thwart the terrorists
but his family becomes the next
target for the breakaway sect of the
IRA.
What follows is a mixture of
violence, suspence and a web of
shifting alliances that held m
e
enthralled. There have been some
reviewers that have derided this
film for its portrayal of the IRA and
its stereotyping of the Irish, but I
feel that the use of a breakaway
section distances thefilmfrom such
criticism.

What am I doing watching a film
about a boxer, by the director of
Rocky and the Karate Kid? I'm the
sort offilmbuff that goes out to see
art films that will never get
anywhere; beautifulfilmsthat few
will ever see. Most importantly,
I'm a pacifist whose stomach turns
every time he sees a blow land in
a fight.
The press release said that The
Power of One was 'An exhilarating
epic of a triumph of the heart' and
concerned itself with the struggle
against apartheid at its inception.
The Power of One; the one on the left is the boxer.
This it did, and did so beautifully.
PK (a white boy, and the hero of
the piece) is seen as a messiah by
the blacks, and it is this influence
over the populus that enables this
particular one to have so much
power. His torment over whether
his life belongs to himself, or those
who need him is explored in great
depth.
Unfortunately, the film is also
about boxing. PK is a talented
boxer, and the film found it difficult
the reconcile the facts that he lived
his life by violence yet was a
peaceful man. Perhaps this is a
quandary that the film is attempting
to explore. If this is so then I feel
that it has failed. The Power of One
is a film that stands between two
stools. It concentrates too much on
the drama and emotion to grip as an
action film and too much on action
and violence to make it as a drama.
None the less, a near miss.
Stef.

In an unorthodox bid tofillsome
space, and to gain some free tickets,
an unscrupulous and panicking hack
gets worked up over this week's
wonderful world of cinema. Me, in
fact. If you were to wendle your
way down Portobello Rd this
monday, I prithee, imbibe two
greats from the genius that is Peter
Greenaway, namely, The Cook,
The Thief. His Wife and Her
Lover, and Prospero's Books, his
marvellous vision of The Tempest.
That's monday and tuesday for you.
On the same days (how can you
stand it?) Diva (which speaks for
itself) and Luc Besson's Subway
with pre-Highlander Christophe
Lambert and Isabelle Adjani. How
many more lines have I to fill?
Ha! Start a new paragraph, that's
always a good way to kill a line or
two... Wednesday/thursday sees
once more the fake nose of Gerard
Depardieu, worn like a natural in
Cyrano De Bergerac, and Annette
Bening in Milos Forman's
adaptation of Les Liaisons
Dangereuses, Valmont. The
Mambo Kings plays on the same
days, but don't be put off; I'm not.
Especially as I haven't seen the
Mambo Kings, and am keen to
avoid making rash predictions. It
might be good. Conceivably. New
York, New York is also on, with
the classic double act, De Niro and
Scorsese, oh, and a Minelli thrown
in for good measure. Life, I'm told,
is a cabaret, ol' chum. Kick yo'
heels and put on a happy face.
friday, or Frigga's Day, as us
Northerners call it, plays host to
Daniel Day Lewis, son of Cecil and
quite a 'damn fine actor, not as
good as your Ironses, but better
than your Branaghs', in The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,
quite literally, a lovely film of a
beautiful book. Same day is Last
Tango in Paris, a vicious, orgiastic
film by Bertolucci, and starring
Marlon Brando and a few tarty
types for Brando to sleep with.
Lads! Lads! it's a porn film! If that
was not enough, Saturday features
Pedro Almodovar's debut, Pepi,
Luci, Bom and all the other girls,
which basically exists to explore the
prejudices and taboos of Spain, and
another Almodovar flick, Dark
Habits, about a junkie. Curiously
enough, the same day runs a
promotion on a certain Spanish beer
- free samples!! - whose name I will
not promote, but if there's another
Spanish beer aside from this one,
then I don't know about it. 'Byeee.
(Fanfares) (Curtains close) (FIN)
Husband, to wife: Dahling! What
