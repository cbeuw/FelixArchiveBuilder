G u y s & Dolls
'Guys and Dolls' is the latest
musical production by The Young
Vic Youth Theatre. Being partial to
musicals I found the entertainment
most enjoyable.
An age old play, portraying the
gamblers and their molls of the
I930's Broadway as light-hearted
and good-natured, underneath their
rough, streetwise exterior. This is
convenient for the story who's
underlying theme tries to prove that
the forces of good, in the guise of
the Salvation Army, can lead these
guys and dolls back to the straight
and narrow. All this hinges on a
bet.
The characters Nathan Detroit
(Gary Moynihan), the gambling
racketeer and his doll, Miss
Adelaide (Juliet Aghion), were
played with verve and both
managed extremely good Brooklyn
accents. On the other hand, the two
other leads, Ben Caplan, (a
moralising gambler), and Nicole
Kingston, (the Salvation Army
Sergeant), did not seem at ease with
their roles to the same degree.
The effort put in by the cast as a
whole paid off tremendously, with
the ensemble pieces being the high-
point of most scenes. The singing
and dancing were executed with
professionalism and looked a great
deal of fun.
Don't miss out on this version of
this classic musical.

If you want to see a 'wickedly
funny' musical parody of American
history, don't go and see
Christopher Street Columbus. Let
me explain.
The story centres around a
carnival celebrating the
quincentenary of Columbus'
voyage. But the Mayor hasn't found
Jack to a King'
a suitable Columbus. Cue
Christopher, a narcotics-chewing,
Harlem-drawling black out-of-work
•actor, who just happens to have had
a gay affair with the Mayor. This
skeletal storyline rapidly becomes
an excuse for in-jokes ('Oops, I
dropped the gerbil'), innuendoes
and musical quips about the trials
and traumas of being anything other
than white, middle class and hetero
in America. Oh dear.
The result is a despairingly bad
exercise in social awareness which
makes you feel more like a voyeur
at a freak show than a theatregoer.
The first half was dragged back
from the brink of crassness by
Regina. the red-sequinned drag
queen. But the whole production
would have been much more
palatable crammed into a five-

From a Jack to a King is written and
performed by the team that brought
Return to the Forbidden Planet to
the world. It is a raucous, loud,
musical about the rise and fall of
musician Eric Glamis (Stage name
Thane Cawdor) whose ambition
o'erieaps itself and soon leads to the
murder of the lead singer by
sabotage of his motorbike. He is
brought to justice by the police
who, as we all know are not of
woman born.
The musical is very fast and
smooth, and the performers all
proficient in a wide variety of
instruments and musical styles. The
one line jokes, mostly
Shakespearean and always fast,
keep the audience laughing and the
visual gags are hilarious. It is a tale
full of sound and fury, and it most
definitely does signify nothing, but
those telling it are certainly not
idiots. From a Jack to a King is a
fairground ride. It is most enjoyable
at the time, too shallow to have any
lasting impact, but leave you
wanting to return and re-experience
it.

thing about the cast was their
