IC Chart 90
Well if you have just crawled out of your
shell after finishing all your exams, and
still don't know that IC has it's own radio
station, then you are in need of a
psychiatrist. However, those of you who
listen to IC radio will know that it
broadcasts on 999 AM, 24 hours a day.
IC radio is the country's only student
radio station broadcasting in a built up
area.They have a variety of music
programmes daily to suit the tastes of
everybody, together with an excellent
news service with regular bulletins. You
lot out there are even given the chance
to phone in with your own requests so
that they may be played on the airwaves,
and make the rest of us suffer in torment.
With this in mind, IC Radio together with
FELIX, are going to try to find out what
are the most popular songs among the IC
students. All we ask of you is to fill out
the form below (simply tell us what your
favourite 3 singles are) and hand it in to
either the FELIX office or directly to IC
Radio.Hopefully, the DJ's at IC Radio will
try to play as many of the entries as
possible, with the compiled chart being
played on IC Radio as well as being
published in the end-of-year summer issue
of FELIX. And a draw will be made from
all the entries allowing one lucky person
a chance to win a CD/LP/Tape of
his/her own choice.
