The imminence of exams has finally
begun to take it's toll on the peace of
mind of this fair Editor, and so this and
the next issue of Felix are largely under
the control of my ever vigilant
Production Manager Chris. In the mean
time I'm going to be working at passing
this year (!), and doing as much as I can
for the extra-special-super-dooper-and-
very-large SUMMER SPECIAL!!!! (the
crowd goes wild...)
The extra-special, etc, SUMMER
SPECIAL!!!
Yes, it's getting close to that time of year
when every Felix Editor since time began
goes a little bit more crazy than usual,
and decides to go out in a blaze of glory.
I'm a little different to the usual Editor, in
the sense that I'll still be here next year,
and thus will have to live with the
results!
So, Chris and I have, in our eminent
and joint insanity, decided to attempt the
largest ever issue of Felix, complete with
a special type of binding, and lots of
essential summer stuff. However, it's all
top secret, so I'm not going to say any
more. Unless you want to help by writing
something for it, or otherwise giving us a
hand, in which case you too could
become one of the select group of people
who are 'in the know'. What an
incentive...
Moving swiftly along, but not much
further, if you lazy slobs are going to
miss out on the end of term and all the
parties by leaving early, you're going to
miss the Extra Special Summer Issue. So,
if you don't want to miss out you better
drop us a line together with a cheque or
postal order for Â£1 made payable to the
ICU Print Unit to cover postage (yes it's
very heavy!).
