Friendly Accommodation
Flat Segregation
Accomodation in London can be a real bind
sometimes. Even if you find a place, it is
not always very welcoming. Consequently,
one of our aims as Chaplains is to
encourage community. We run several
student houses where students don't just
have four walls to go home to, but a
community to live in. This is forged by a
weekly meeting to discuss relationships and
any day to day matters, like shopping and
rent payment. Houses agree to eat their
main evening meal together each day (more
or less). Each house goes away on a
weekend early in the new term to forge
better relationships.
There are two ways in which this might
interest you. Firstly, we have one or two
places left, and you may wish to apply.
Secondly, you may already be in a flat with
friends and want to explore the idea of
community for yourselves, but want advice.
Either way, we hope that your student days
will be enhanced. The opportunity is there
for the taking.

Dear FELIX,
In the debate about changes in
administering the residences one aspect
seems in danger of being lost amongst
the more immediate issue of increased
rent. I refer to the matter of re-grouping
room allocations according to length of
stay, thus effectively splitting student
population groups up even more. In the
long term I suspect that this will have a
broader impact on college life as a whole
than any other of the proposals.
This seems a very peculiar approach to
take when so many staff at the college do
their utmost to try and integrate the
community, from the tutorial group at an
academic level, through to HUB and
Union activities at a social level. This,
too, at the very time in life that it is
beneficial for students to broaden their
experience and contact with a wide
variety of people, so fitting them better
for employment. Also, hearing so much
talk about Europe and how the college is
rightly adapting to it's challenge, how can
it at the same time be doing the opposite

and narrowing cross-cultural contact,
simply out of administrative convenience.
I'm sure that it would be administratively
more convenient if students and staff
stayed in bed and didn't clutter up so
many labs, canteens and other facilities.
Imperial College does not have a good
name for its community feel and balanced
social mix and, as I've already pointed
out, many staff and students go beyond
the call of duty to counteract this.
However, to have such positive attempts
sabotaged at such a fundamental level as
in residence administration, which is the
one social aspect the college does have
control over, raises real questions about
the overall integration of college policies.
I would urge everyone to reconsider
what social conditions we already have,
how we can enhance them within the
constraints we are given, and not to let
this matter rest.
