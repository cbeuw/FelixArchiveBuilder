The latest films by Jim Clayden.
Jewel of the Nile
(practically everywhere)
continues the story where
Romancing the Stone left
off, you didn't see it?
Well...romantic novelist,
Joan Wilder, and
adventurer, Jack Colton,
have met in South America
and fallen madely in love.
Jewel of the Nile finds
them six months later in
the South of France and
some of the tensions of
sharing a yacht for such a
long time are beginnig to
show. Joan, Kathleen
Turner, is required to go
ashore to a publishers
party and there she meets a
romantic Arab leader who
wishes to whisk her off to
write his story, just like a
plot of a novel she could
have written. Unfortunately
the Arab is a baddy (gasp)
and soon Jack Michael
Douglas, and the good
Arabs are pitted against the
bad Arabs.
Like Romancing the
Stone it doesn't take itself
too seriously and there are
plenty of jokes, often from
Danny De Vito, the tiny
tyrant from 'Taxi', whose
sole motivation in this film
appears to be greed. The
script however lacks the
sparkle of the original and
over all the film doesn't
come across as quite as
engaging. There is however
plenty of action as one of
the problems of filming in
the desert is that you need
a lot of activity to fill the
wide open spaces.
(Amongst the props
required were serveral guns
and mortars and a mock F-
16 aircraft which apparently
caused some consternation
in customs as the country
where it was filmed was at
war the time.)
Kathleen Turner is one of
the better and more
attractive actresses around
at the moment, capable of
doing the comedy with
superb timing The Man
with Two Brains and
manipulation seduction
Body Heat and all
characters inbetween. Her
roles are always very
capable and independent
people, and inspite of
playing a writer of romantic
fiction Joan Wilder is far
from the stereotypes of that
genre.
Michael Douglas is not
quite as talented, although
cute and quite fun, he
doesn't really possess the
ability to convey a great
range of emotions very
deeply, but this part doesn't
call for too much effort so
he copes well enough.
The director, Lewis
Teague, not only directed
two major films previously
both of them Stephen King
adaptations, Cujo and Cats
Eyes, but he proves himself
to be very capable of
handling both comedy and
action, and he provides
some of the most intelligent
use of the widescreen
format I've seen for a long
time.
Williams is a name given to
a cop who has been
kidnapped and given a new
face in order that he can
work for a secret
organisation whose
purpose is to eliminate
undesirables and whose
only responsibility is to the
President. (Appropriately
his name comes from a
device used to collect
excrement). The
undesirable.in this case is
an arms manufacturer who
is turning out cheap and
shoddy weapons in order
to maximise his profit.
Admittedly as a result of
the poor quality of one of
his rifles a soldier is killed,
but the film emphasises his
financial crimes, such as
taking money for a satellite
weapon that he has no
intention of completing.
In order to carry out the
elimination of this man,
Remo is trained in the
ancient martial arts by the
racist and sexist, Chiun, in
order that he make the
directors death seem
accidental. Why a marital
Remo sorts out the rats in his kitchen.
The good photography
and lively soundtrack make
it a pleasant, but none too
special film though it is
good to see juggling taking
it's proper place in cinema.
Remo, Unarmed and
Dangerous, provides me
with another excuse for a
tirade about American
morality as depicted in
their movies, particular
ones that have names in
the title that begin in 'R'
and end in 'O'. It would
seem that an appraisal of
American Society's
priorities were made on the
basis of the film (highly
unrepresentative and
unfair, I know) then
embezzlement and fraud
are considered greater
transgressions than murder
and the punishment are a
little Draconican.
Anyway, the plot: Remo
arts expert is better able to
do this than anyone else is
one of the many mysteries
of this film, as is why the
Major is allowed to wear
red stillettos on duty.
However it does provide
the film with some amusing
lines from Chiun's offhand
remarks. Chuin is played
by Joel Grey who played
the M C In Cabaret but you
probably wouldn't
recognise him unless
someone told you.
Someone told me.
It is directed by a veteran
from Bad movies, Guy
Hamilton, so it has some
style and humour but it
doesn't really succeed on
any level, particularly the
relationship between Chiun
and Remo, inspite of, and
maybe because of, trying
several different ideas at
once.
