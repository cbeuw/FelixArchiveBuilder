College Secretary John
Smith and one of the
incoming sabbaticals are
said to have been among
the guests at a riotous
wedding at 170 Queensgate
during Easter. According to
sources, Mr Smith was
seen 'struting his funky
stuff' on the dance floor
while the new sabbatical
was playing piano.
Dave Kingston spent the
first week of the Easter
holidays lounging around
at the National Student
Services Organisation
freebie in Newcastle. While
he was away, though,
certain 'friends' thought
that his absence would be
an ideal opportunity to
redecorate his office.
Unfortunately for Mr
Kingston, his friends had
rather unusual ideas about
office design. They
removed all the furniture
and replaced it with a
paddling pool full of home
brew, urine nad stale water.
Perhaps with friends like
that you'll understand why
enormous amounts of
money were raised for Mr
Kingston to be thrown in
the mud.
Students at College Hall,
the exclusively female
inter-collegiate hall, are
said to have organised last
term a strip show for the
edification and
entertainment of its
occupiers and presumably,
their guests too. The
organisers suggested that it
would comprise of a single
male stripper.
The warden of the hall,
who was described by one
of the residents as being
senile, gave her consent for
this project. In addition,
there were no calls, or
hints, from any group to
organise a protest against
or a picket at the event.
The latter tactic was
succesfully employed, just
over a year ago, against the
Mine's Hon Porn Night; the
show was forced to be
abandoned, although
another has since been
held.
One of the organisers of
the event at College Hall
was also apparently a
leader of the picket at
Imperial College.
College Hall denied
organising the event but
admitted that any of their
students could have held
such a party at the Hall
privately.
The College Masonic
Lodge were most upset at-
the recent issue of Feelsick
that described Dave
Kingston as a mason.
Apparently they held an
inquiry into who leaked the
story. Well boys we're not
saying who it was who told
us but it's not who you
think it is.
Finally, Carl Burgess has
been making his merry way
round College pissing on
people's beds. This week
the lucky recipients of a
'sample' from Carl are Pete
Hartley and Eleanor
Malcolm. FELIX will give a
small prize to anyone who
guesses correctly which
beds Carl will piss in next

Money's Too
Tight To
Mention
In late 1984 one of the hundreds of odd little committees
in the University of London set up a working party to
consider student accommodation needs. One of the first
decisions taken by this working party was to commission
a survey into the difficulties and problems of student
accommodation in London, covering topics such as what
kinds of halls of residence are preferred, how much
people are willing and able to pay, travelling times etc.
External Affairs Officer Gren Manuel has looked through
the result.
This document is now
lying on my desk. It's big:
there's no need for a survey
to discover that. It has 84
accommodation'. However
much of the information
which can be distilled from
the report is suprising, and
Gren Manuel: alarmed that low incomes are getting lower
and high rents are getting higher
pages of complex
numberspeak, and is
probably the most
comprehensive work on
this subject ever. Some of
the data is irrelevant to
students at our particular
hallowed institution, and
the occasional figure seems
to have been included more
out of interest than
importance. (Did you know
that on average
postgraduates spent 27p
more on lunch than
undergraduates?)
Nevertheless this pile of
paper represents a
significant commitment by
the University to tailoring
it's accommodation policy
to the needs and
preferences of those who it
is supposed to serve.
Many of the points made
are intuitive, Jout still it is
useful to have this intuition
backed by the certainty of
statistics. For example the
report says that 'living in
privately rented
accomodation is associated
with a high expenditure on
some of it may come as
uncomfortable news to
some.
Income: One of the tables
shows total yearly income
broken down by faculty,
showing how income is
related to the subject of
study. Interestingly there is
a lot of difference between
faculties, with engineers
averaging £3414 for the
entire year 1984/5 and
scientists only £2743, with
the difference presumably
being accounted for by
sponsorships and better-
paid summer jobs. 30% of
those in receipt of an L E A
grant received the full
amount, and of those who
were assessed for a
parental contribution 80%
received it in full. Of those
who didn't more than half
were £200 short, and one in
five more than £600 short.
25% of those eligable for
grant reported delays or
difficulties in getting it.
Some form of state
benefit is claimed by 25%
of students, mostly housing
