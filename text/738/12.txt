INCOST 86
by Luke Walker
Carl Burgess and I spent
last term in Ghent,
Belguim, as the English
delegation to the annual
International Conference of
Students in Technology. I
hope in this article to give
some details about this
event, and some of my
reactions to it. I am not
setting out to justify the
money that ICU spent on
sending us to it, other than
that I have it on good
authority that the sum
involved in sending both of
us to Belgium is very
similar to what it costs the
Union to send one delegate
to the NUS/National
Students Services
Organisation confernce in
Newcastle earlier this year.
Also, I should perhaps
remind students that the
work the Union does in
representating their
interests, ie Academic
Affairs, is a very low budget
area of the Union's activity
(in C & G I receive no
specific allocation of
funding.)
INCOST was attended by
delegations from most
northern European
countries; Scotland,
Northern Ireland, England,
Sweden, Norway, Finland,
Holland, Belguim, Poland,
and also students from
Yugoslavia and the United
States. There was a total of
about 40 students, in
addition to other local
Ghent students who
organised the conference.
We spent five days going
through a very full and
heavy schedule of lectures
by senior Belgian
industrialists and other
workshops, discussion
session, visits to local
factories, and visits to other
sites of interest around
Ghent. One of the most
interesting visits was a tour
of the new harbour
construction site at
Zeebrugge.
The theme of the
conference was
management and
engineering, so many of
the lectures were given by
engineers who had been
succesful in managment
and commerce-including a
venture capitalist. He
claimed that there is plenty
of money available to
engineers who wish to set
up their own company-the
problems is having a good
idea to develop. We were
also given lectures about
the other end of the
spectrum; multinational
companies such as Volvo
and the Royal Dutch Shell
Group.
Having attended
INCOST, I would strongly
recommend that ICU
continues to send
delegates to it. Obviously, it
is not easy to point to
specific ways in which this
will be of direct and
immediate benefit to IC
students. However it is a
very useful forum for the
exchange of views between
students of different
nations, and I learnt a lot

about the students
organisations and
engineering education
system of other countries. I
think that many English
people tend to neglect the
importance of the countries
(particularly where English
is not the first language) to
what we do here. We can
and should take
opportunities to learn from
each other. A specialist
conference for technology
students is a very useful
forum, since co-operation
between nations in
industrial, economic and
technological development
is becoming more common.
I enjoyed my time at
Incost, and am grateful to
Council for agreeing to
send Carl and myself. I feel
that both Carl and I made
good use of the
opportunity presented to us
to make friends with
students from other
countries (this was assisted
by them speaking English!),
and I hope to visit some of
the contacts I made in the
future.
If any students wish to
find out more in detail of
what Carl and I did and
learned and discussed at
the conference, you are, of
course, welcome to ask.
And in case anyone
thought that we went to the
conference to drink
excessive volumes of
alcohol, I didn't drink any
(being the token non-
alcoholic on the C & G Exec,
as many people already
know!) and in my view, Carl
behaved himself very well.
It was commented several
times by other delegates
that Carl and I are very
different people-so we
could try to give the
impression that IC students
aren't all the same-but the
way in which we both
approached INCOST, ie
seriously, was one
similarity.

by Carl Burgess
Topic:
Entrepreneurship in
Engineeing, Industrial
Management
Although the conference
was primarily about these
matters we gained a lot of
information gained about
how Universities are set up
in other countries; in
particular and workings of
the grants systems in the
European countries, how
long their courses are, what
options are available to
them, what they are
actually taught and how
their courses compare to
ours.
1 The Loan System
Even though most
countries used the loan
system many of them
approximated to grants
because if you could not
pay the loan back you did
not have to. In other
countries they had a
system where by the loan
had to paid off by your
50th birthday at a standard
4% interest rate per year
which would not change
with inflation. Others had
partial loan/grant system
but none had the system
that made their parents pay
for their childrens' higher
eduation if they earned
more than a certain figure.
2 Course Length Most
courses weer four years
long but here"wasa a
general trend ot increasing
the lengths fo the courses
to four and half years or
even five years.
The reasons for this can
be seen from the fact that
they all do two years of
general scientific study
with a emphasis on
mathemetics and then they
branch out at the point to
specialise in the fields that
interest them, such as
Energy Technology or
Engineering Physics (as
they like to call it. This
points to a high degree of
specialisation in a
particular field at the actual
University which is not
available here (even if it
were desirable)
There seems to be
greater flexibility within the
other European systems to
enable students to find out
what they are suited for.
3 Non Technical Options
Another factor ;
n the
lengths of the courses are
the number of non-
technical options available
for the students to study. A
high emphasis is placed on
the planing of mangerial
skills, economic theory,
foreign language study,
and the social aspects of
technology.
I have decided not to
include a detailed report of
what the actual program of
events were organised as
Luke has already written
one of his long and verbose
recitations.
