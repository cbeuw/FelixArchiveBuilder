Capital Ideas
The international scene',
we media types say,
been looking sonMwiii
dodgy hist lately, and so it
was with possible future use
in mind Skat f recently want
to see the film
ReanJmator. A gothic gore
shocker in the the classic
vein, this is a film which
manages to preserve amid
its black humour the moralist
sub-plots that occur in the
best of the original horror
genre such as Frankenstein.
It's based on a Lovecraft
book so you can guess the
level of taste. I saw the film
at the local Scala which is a
place that I am happy to plug
regularly for its imaginative
programmes. Last month the
Scala attempted to show the
film 'A Clockwork Orange'
which has long been
prohibited in this country on
rather anomalous grounds.
Alas the print was seized by
HM plods on this occasion
but they have advised that
they wil try to show it again
at a later date, so watch the
listings for titles such as
'Alex's Adventures'.
Steve Martin's the Man
With Two Brains and now
showing at the ICA in the
.Mall. Martin's work has
tended to vary in standard
but he remains a much
rated comedian and this
of his better efforts,
ring at the ICA next
and Tuesday is Don
ta Punk Rock
Movie, perhaps one of the
better records of the
beginning of punk. Forget
the pretentious Jubilee or
tile Great Reck V Ron
As usual Spitting Image
remains one of the few
programmes worth watching
on the zombie box. This
week's offering brought to
mind the words of Roosevelt
on the eve of Hiroshima "OK
you can bomb the little
bastards." Just shows that
cataclysmic horror is nothing
new to the world. To
reinforce this, there is a
great twist in the end of The
Return of the Living
Dead now showing at the
ABC cinemas all over the
show. This is probably, along
with Reanlmator, one of
the few shockers worth
seeing at the moment so
give the likes of
Frlghtnlght and
Crimewave a miss. On the
lighter front I cant argue
with our "best' ever writer
from last week when he talks
about Alan Bleasdale's No
Surrender. Having heard
Bleasdale interviewed on the
radio I would afc|i^i|§
him the benefit of the <

to be a man with a
