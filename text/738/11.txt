Angry Digits
In an attempt to get back at
Mobius, my puzzle fanatical
friend, who had been
distracting me with his
annoying puzzles, I
designed this cross-number
to keep him quiet for a
while. T o my
embarrassment Mobius
appeared the next day
saying that I had made a
mistake and one of my
clues must be wrong. He
was right, of course, but in
checking I noticed
something interesting.
'Ah, but if you take the
incorrect clue to mean the
exact opposite of what it
says, then there is a unique
solution', I said . With this
new information in hand he
went away to solve the
problem.
So what is the solution,
and which clue is incorrect
(NB I consider 1 to be a
prime number)? Solutions,
comments etc, to the FELIX
office by Wednesday
lunchtime for the £5 prize,
please.

Shagar's sheep-solution
There can only be 19
sheep.It's possible to
arrange 18 and 20 sheep so
that there are 5 or 9 on
each side, but it requires
having either all or none of
the sheep in overlapping
areas, which wasn't
allowed. Lots of anwsers to
this one, so you obviously
found it quite easy. Two
possible arrangments are
shown below.

A cable of cables
Several people entered
correct solutions to this (or
solutions that were so
nearly correct that I
counted them). There were
two basic solutions both of
which I've explained. The
anwser is that all the cables
can be correctly labelled in
one journey to the end and
back (unless there are only
two cables, in which case
the problem is impossible).
I'm sure those of your who
had him travelling
log(x)/log(2) etc times
along the cable will
appreciate the anwser.
The first solution varies
depending on whether the
cable contains an odd or
even number of wires. The
version for an odd number
is described, with varations
for an even number in
brackets afterwards.
Starting at the site we shall
call the 'Home' site join the
wires together in pairs but
leave one (two) wires
unconnected. This (These)
will be referred to as the
alpha wire (the alpha and
beta wires, though we don't
yet know which is which).
Now travel to the other site,
which we shall refer to as
the 'field'. Using the battery
and bulb it is easy to find
the alpha wire (the alpha
and beta wires) because it
is (they are) the only ones
not connected to anything.
Label this wire as the alpha
wire (Label either wire
alpha, the other beta).
We can also pair off the
other wires, labelling them
arbitrarily as 1a and 1b, 2a
and 2b,3a and 3b,...na and
nb. Each a is connected to
the corresponding b at the
home site, of course.
Now disconect 1a. Connect
1 b to 2a, 2b to 3a 3b to
4a,...(n-1)b to na, and nb to
alpha. Leave 1a (and beta)
disconected.
Back to the home site,
where the alpha wire is
already labelled (where the
alpha beta wires are
labelled, and we can soon
find which is which since
alpha is conected to
something while beta isn't).
Disconnect all the wires at
the home site (but
remember how they were
connected). Using the
battery and bulb, find
which wire is connected to
alpha at the field site. This
is nb. The wire which was
connected to nb (at the
home site) is na. The wire
connected to na (at the
field site) is (n-1)B. The
wire which was conencted
to (n-1)b (at the home site)
is (n-1)a. Hence, by
chaining the wires in this
way, all of them can be
labelled in only two
journeys between the ends
of the cable.
The second solution is as
follows. At the 'home' site
connect together the wires
in groups with ascending
numbers of wires, starting
at one, until the remaining
no of wires is not enough
to form the next group (ie
groups of 1,2,3,4,...n wires).
Call the largest group in
the ascending series n, and
the number of remaining
wires m. Form these
remaining wires into a
group unless m is equal to
n, in which case leave one
wire unconnected (call this
the 'free' wire) and form a
group of m-1 wires.
Now travel to the far site.
Use the battery to identify
the groups. Lable the wires
in the ascending groups 1a,
2a,2b,3a,3b,3c,...etc. Label
the m (or m-1) group m a * ,
mb*...etc so as to
differentiate it from the
ascending group of the
same size. Now connect
wire 1a to all the other 'a'
wires. Then connect 2b to
all the other 'b' wires, 3c to
all the other 'c' wires, etc.
Continue like this, except
leave one wire of the m (or
m-1) group unconnected.
There will also be one wire
of the n group
unconnected.
Now go back to the 'home'
site. Disconnect the wires
but remember what groups
they were in. If there was a
'free' wire it can easily be
found since it is the only
unconnected wire in a
group of 1. Now find which
wires are connected to the
first wire in the ascending
series, these will be the
2a,3a,4a,...etc. The wire left
unlabled in the group of 2
will be 2b, and the wires
connected to this will be
3b, 4b,...etc. Carry on until
all the wires are labelled.
The m (or m-1) group can
be differentiated by the fact
that it's last wire is
unconnected.
Well done to all of you who
attempted a solution and
congratulations if you got it
right. The winner was M
Turnbull, Physics 3. You
can pick up your £5 prize
after 1pm Monday.
