Laurie Anderson is
pretentious. But not too
pretentious. From the
opening 'standby' through
to the last 'listen to my
heartbeat' she keeps her
balance, just never quite
reminiscent of 'Big

Laurie Anderson returns to
the low-key ambience of

Simon Lewis looks at the latest from the Donmar.
Swim Visit by Wesley Moore,
(The Donmar Warehouse
until May 17th)
Swim Visit is set in a small
Illinois town in the mid-
West of the USA. It deals
with the relationships and
interrelationships of four
people on what at first
appears to be a lazy
afternoon around the pool
in early Summer. Swim
Visit is well worth seeing.
Throughout the play the
cast maintained an
oppressive intensity.
Initially this appeared to be
due entirely to Izz, a manic
depressive who switched
from anger and tears to
laughter, often during the
course of a sentence.
Patricia Elliott gave a fine
performance, and at times,
the way she conveyed inner
pain felt too real, as she
tried continuously to fill her
'silences'. However her well
devised larger-than-life
traumas did not blot out
the other characters and it
became increasingly
apparent that her husband
Ted, was also plagued with
life's problems. Whether the
roots of Izz and Ted's
suffering was ultimately
due to their relationship, or
to more external factors,
was one of the questions
left to the audience to
decide.
The other two characters,
Beth and Clay, seemed
relatively unscathed. Beth,
a younger friend of Izz's
was recently widowed,
while Clay, a 'College boy',
was employed as a foremen
at the fibreglass tray
factory owned by Ted. Clay
betrayed very little of his
inner feelings and
maintained a certain
distance as he tried, in
vain, to explain the
imminent collapse of the
factory and the likely action
of the employees to Ted,
who appeared withdrawn
and unable to care. Clay's
relationship with the two
women was very sexual,
appropriately illustrated
when Beth commented: 'Oh
Clay...what beautiful
vegetables!', while staring
at his genitals!
The play's involvement
and strong allusion to
water, traditionally a life
giving force, which occured
as a recurring theme,
seemed to suggest that Izz
and Ted's relationship was
in some way incomplete
and fruitless. This imagery
was a particularly
compelling feature of the
play as a whole. Ted spoke
of the factory he had set
up, his lifes achievement
as: '...my baby...' but later
shouted that: 'This
company has ruined my
life'; while Izz told Ted:
'You are a dried up piece of
skin...' They both seemed
to yearn for some kind of
'real' child, or life giving
force, and the lack of this
may have been the reason
why they appeared to be
drowning in their own
separate obsessions. As
Clay commented to Beth:
'They are both off in their
own little world'. The
inevitable destruction of
Ted's factory coupled with
the lack of achievement of
Izz's life, smacked of their
desire, unattained, for
immortality.
Increasingly, Beth and
Clay became sucked into
Izz and Ted's scheme of
things, and in the end it
seemed that what had
started as an afternoon
around the pool, might
continue endlessly, for all
time.
A simple non-naturalistic
'pool-side' area, bathed in
light, jutting out into the
surrouonding audience
created a feeling of
lethargy and warmth which
was in stark contrast to the
action taking place,
enhacing it. Two
deckchairs formed the
core, around which were
large oddly shaped green
objects. These were later
revealed to be an attempt
at topiary. Changes in the
mood and time of day were
achieved by a number of
lighting effects.
Swim Visit was
technically simple. This did
not interfere with the words
and actions which spoke
for themselves, admirably.
I was left feeling excited
and stumulated.
John Sessions at the
Eleventh Hour
The Donmar Warehouse,
11pm Fridays and
Saturdays only, to the 17th
May (Bar until 1.30pm)
John Sessions one person
show is extremely funny.
The humour ranged from
the obscure to the
ridiculous and yet managed
to entertain throughout.
The energy generated by
this man, coupled with his
sharp dialogue, which
ranged from the plight of
oral bacteria to impressions
of Tina Turner, kept the
packed house on the edge
of their seats.
The only fault was one of
judging where the line
between humour and
prejudice should lie, and
there were a few occasions
when the line was crossed,
but that is a matter for the
individual to decide.
