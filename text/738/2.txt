J Rag Fete
i As you will probably read
\ elsewhere, Carl was
j extremely drunk on
\ Saturday at Rag Fete. Not
i only did he embarass
I himself but he was a
\ disgrace to the people who
| he's meant to represent.
I j Many of the guests,
| including Ann Diamond,
| must have decided that
j Carl was a drunken idiot.
\ God knows what they
thought of the people who
had elected Carl as their
representative.
Carl has had a long hard
year during which he has
little time to relax. Rag Fete
was an ideal opportunity to
relax. If he wanted to he
could have got drunk and
i avoided all the official
i receptions. Most people
wouldn't have complained.
Instead he insisted on
II making an idiot of himself.
j Carl this year has lost the
confidence of many
ordinary students because
he has shown himself to be
irresponsible. Union
members think that he is a
drunken fool incapable of
organising a piss-up in a
brewery. As a result
students have also lost
confidence in Union. Carl's
public displays of
drunkeness have damaged
the little public support the
Union had before he took
office.
Carl's displays of of
drunkeness have also
allienated many of the
people who have to work
with him. How can one not
be embarassed to have
such a fool for a colleague?
Several very talented
people have considered
stopping work for the
Union after Carl's most
recent display.
It's difficult to be a good
President but Carl has
done worse than anyone in
living memory. I hope
Christine learns from Carl's
mistakes.
On a lighter note I'd like
to praise the work of John
Ingham, Man Tai, Christian
Union and everyone else
who made the day a
success. Christian Union
were particularly impressive
doing all the menial jobs
necessary for the Fete to
be a success.

Congratulations
Rag Fete: An amazing success
the good behaviour of all
who attended the party
afterwards. It was one of
the most enjoyable days I
have had in ages and I
hope in future years more
people get involved to
make it even more
successful. It was a shame
our union does not usually
Dear Hugh, shine like this in its
I was impressed by the activities but hopefully the
success of Rag Fete and by unions other activities will
follow the example of Rag
Fete and hence enhance
the Unions image within
College. But
congratulations to Man Tai,
John Ingham and all the
other organisers and to the
Rector for being a good
sport and buying a bad
taste tie from our jumble
sale.

Dear Sir/Madam,
As regular customers of
Waitrose, we note that you
stock a considerable
amount of South African
produce. This is against the
wishes of the people of
South Africa'who want to
see an end to apartheid.
We beleive that to
support their wishes you
should cease to sell South
African goods.
If you feel unable to or
unwilling to adopt this
course of action, we shall
be obliged to shop
elsewhere,

Pissed
Dear Hugh
I do not usually like to
write critical letters to
FELIX but the actions of
our Union President at this
year's Rag Fete had
incensed not only myself
but many others involved in
the organisation and
running of the event.
Members of the Rag
Committee arranged for TV
AM's Anne Diamond to
open the fete in between a
heavy broadcasting
schedule and she kindly
agreed to give up her time
for us. That morning Carl
Burgess arrived, clearly
drunk and being obnoxious
to everyone. He had
previously declined the
offer to escort Miss
Diamond around the fete
and to attend a specially
arranged reception but now
insisted on joining the
party. The whole time he
was rude, incoherent,
agressive and a total
embrassment to the rest of
the reception. He was dirty,
stank of drink and treated
everyone as his menials.
Miss Diamond was
obviously annoyed by his
behaviour but remained
calm and polite throughout
the ordeal. When she left,
Carl made sure that she got
more than just a kiss.
