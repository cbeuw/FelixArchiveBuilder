i Libyan Squat
The Libyan Consulate near
College has been occupied
by squatters for nearly two
weeks. Around forty people
including at least one IC
student are believed to be
living in the Consulate
which is in Watts Way, the
road leading to the
Southside halls. The house
has been unused for
around 18 months, and the
squatters believe that such
a large building should not
be left empty while people
need somewhere to live.
They hope that the
Consulate will provide
1
accommodation for some
time, following the example
of the Cambodian
Embasssy, which has been
the home of squatters for
five years. The Consulate
building is thought to be
the property of the Crown,
\ on a long lease to the
i Libyan Government.
i The Consulate,
i predictably quite grand in
style, is in great disarray
inside; most of the offices
have been thoroughly and
roughly searched, perhaps
by British agencies after
the Consulate closed, and
some of the doors have
been broken down.
Furniture, office equipment
including several
photocopiers and a telex
machine are scattered
about offices, and
thousands of copies of
Colonnel Qadhafi's 'Green
Book' and bundles of
papers are stacked around
the floor of many of the
rooms.
The squatters are keen to
emphasise that none of the
damage is their work, and
that they mean to act
within the law. The police,
who have visited several
times, seem to have no
intention to try to remove
them, since they have
committed no offence.
They have barricaded the
doors, however, and most
of the windows are barred
and curtained.
A FELIX reporter was
allowed into the Consulate
on Wednesday. The
residents were starting to
move the quantities of
papers into just a few
rooms, so that work could
begin on making the rest
habitable. The utility
supplies were then intact,
and the sqatters had
applied to be supplied with
electricity. While the
reporter was there, though,
four men from the L E B
arrived, asking to read the
meter. Having done so they
looked around the house,
ostensibly searching for the
cause of unsually high
power consumption. On
leaving , they were
questioned by police, some
number of whom had
arrived, as to how many
people were inside and on
other matters. The
electricians later returned
to disconnect the supply,
so that the squatters now
have no heating or light.
Later that day the LEB dug
up the pavement outside
the building to cut the
supply there too. The first
of the squatters to move in
were a group from
Islington; very few of the
people living in the
Consulate are students.
Later on Wednesday the
LEB lifted a cover in the
pavement to cut the supply
there too, but it appears
that they are prepared to
reconnect the Consulate if
the resident reapply, since
the outstanding
consumption is not due to
the squatters.

'Fundamental Threat1
The British Pugwash group,
an association of scientists
concerned with the threat
of nuclear war has issued a
statement in opposition to
the starwars program. They
are worried that 'SDI may
represent a fundamental
threat to academic
freedom' and will draw
resources away from the
Civil programme. The
group feels that SDI will be
unlikely to be able to
defend populations and
they are concerned that
certain areas of SDI will not
work.
The move follows a
conference held on April
14th entitled 'the
acceptability of SDI
research contracts' The
conference was attended
by several academics from
Imperial and a
memorandum on SDI
circulated by Imperial
Research contracts office
was included amongst the
items for discussion.
During the meeting four
speakers spoke both in
favour and against SDI
contracts. The Ministry of
Defence was represented
by Mr Gallagher Daggitt, an
Assistant Director with
responsibility for
universities. He told the
conference that the Anglo
American Memorandum of
understanding was a
'business contract' which
had been classified for
economic reasons. After
making contradictory
statements on the financial
returns for universities, Mr
Gallagher Daggitt revealed
that $100 million was
available to be shared
between participating
countries and not $2.7
billion as had previously
been reported.
Athletes

Imperial College won the
overall London Colleges'
Athletics championships
and the men's
championships on Tuesday
and Wednesday. In the
overall championship
Imperial came first with 143

and Guys with 92 points.
Full details will follow.
Sayers
Gets
Extension
Revised plans for the
Department of Computing
extension have been
released. Contrary to
rumours that the Holland
Club site would be used,
the building will actually be
a free-standing two storey
structure on the east side
of the IC Bookshop. The
plans also show an addition
to the first floor, in the
event that DoC gets an
increased grant for the
project.
FELIX contacted Head of
Department Professor
Sayers on Wednesday
afternoon, following a DoC
Staff meeting to discuss the
proposals. He said that
members of staff were
concerned about the
position of the new
building, halfway along the
Walkway from the main
Department in the Huxley
Building. The Professor
was grateful to be given the
chance to expand the
Department, but felt that it
would not fully remove the
need for space
Kibble
Enthuses
Physics students seem
likely to get a proper
common room to replace
the 'Waveguide'. Head of
Department Professor Tom
Kibble is said to be
enthusiastic about the
scheme proposed by Dep
Rep Simon Singh. Mr Singh
has proposed that the level
2 corridor be carpeted and
decorated At present the
only objection to the
scheme**seems to be the
cost which has been
estimated to be Â£1500.
