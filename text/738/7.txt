benefit. The average yearly
amount paid to those in
receipt of housing benefit
is £234. The small number
of PGs who claimed it
received a relatively high
amount, an average of
£525. Only one in four of
those claiming benefits said
that they had experienced
no problems in getting it.
One of the most
depressing parts of the
report was the table which
indicated whether people
thought they would be in
debt by the end of their
studies. Almost half said
that they would be, and
over a half of these said
that they would owe more
than £200. Half of the
money borrowed by
students is from banks, and
a third by parents. The
large amount of borrowing
from parents plus the large
proportion of people
dependent upon their
parents to make up the
shortfall in their grant
indicate quite clearly that
the dismal student support
system in this country is
preventing students from
getting real independance,
and thus hindering their
complete education.
A particularly startling
statistic is that 59 of the
2005 people in the sample
anticipated being more
than £2000 in debt by the
time they left college. I
wish that the report gave a
more detailed breakdown
on these particular cases,
because they are evidence
of something quite serious.
What infromation is given

halls were very popular
with their residents: about
half of them regard them as
the best place to live.
Only 4% ticked 'I do not
mind sharing a room'.
About 80% of all types of
students did have their own
room, except for those in
college flats/houses, where
more than 50% had to
share. In fact, college flats
and houses seemed rather
unpopular in general, with
a third of their residents
complaining that they
didn't have adequate
facilities for study, and they
were also heavily criticised
for lack of space and poor
heating. The only way in
which they scored was in
their relative freedom from
rules and restrictions.
There was no appreciable
difference between home
and overseas students
when 4 came to expressing
satisfaction in general with
accommodation standards,
neither was there much
difference in this respect
between students with
different levels of
income—luckily
expectations and reality
seem to coincide.
Students at Imperial
stood out as more willing
than most to pay more than
at present to get better
accommodation; nearly
25% would like to do this,
against a University
average of 16%. Only 36%
claimed to be unable to pay
more rent than at present,
against a University figure
of nearly half. This at first
seems to contradict the
widely held view that
students here have to pay
more than average for their
accommodation. The
reason may be that IC has
a relatively large proportion
of students in college
flats/houses, which have
been shown above to be
cheap but relatively
unpopular. A good
proportion of the students
wanting to pay for better
accomodation may be in
these.
Finding somewhere: The
survey contained questions
on how accommodation
was found. The procedure
for getting into a collge
accomodation is well
defined, but hopefully the
following should help to
provide those who will be
looking for somewhere in
the private sector which
strategy is most effective.
These figures are for all
London University
students, but I can't think
of any reason why IC
should be atypical. One
point in which we differ
from the average is that our
own college
accommodation service is
much more popular than
the one run by the
University in Malet St,
Bloomsbury. This may be
because the existence of
the University service is not
widely known here, but
compounding this is the
way that the University
service emerges as badly
run, and I feel that most of
those who do know about it
don't feel that it's worth the
travel.
Conclusion: Sometimes we
at Imperial forget that in
some respects we are
better off than those at
other colleges, despite
some of the problems of
being in central London
and an area of high rents
and high land costs. IC has
a relative abundance of
college accommodation,
even if a proportion of it is
flats and houses.
Unfortuantely the overall
picture is gloomy, with low
incomes getting lower and
high rents getting higher.
At least in commissioning
this report, which must
have cost quite a lot, the
University has shown that it
is not inflexible and is
prepared to listen to what
stduents want and need,
and to find the true nature
of the problems faced. I, for
one, hope that what
problems can be solved are
tackled, and the good
intentions are carried
turned into effective
policies.
