Stonehenge
This Monday saw the
launch at a press
conference in Fleet Street
of an organised campaign
'Stonehenge 86' aimed at
promoting a compromise
solution to the problems of
the annual Stonehenge
Festival via the national
media. It is just over a
month until the first of a
multitude of groups that
constitute the festival are
expected to being heading
for the Wiltshire site and as
; yet there is still little sign of
1
agreement about the
staging of a prolonged
festival. Thus it wasr fears of
' a repeat of last years
I controversial police action
| which seemed to dominate
:
debate.
The meeting was chaired
by Alex Rosenberger, a
j journalist, who, it appeared,
I was acting as spokesman
for a number of diverse
I organsations representing
the various aspects of the
festival. Looking the
epitomy of a young
i Thatcherite executive
rather than a hippy, Mr
I Rosenberger introduced in
; turn Brig Outbridge of
| Green C N D ; Don Aitken of
Festival Welfare Services;
Sid Rawle much reported in
the media as a leading
festival goer; George Smith
a resident of Shrewton
which is near Stonehenge
and Willy X of the
Polytantric Cirle who have
long been involved in the
organisation of free
festivals all over Britain. It
was pointed out that those
present were acting as a
voice for large numbers of
small groups and that it
was these large numbers
acting individually who
would congregate at the
ancient stones during the
June solstice. All present
were careful to emphasis
that they were not
organisers in the normal
sense and that they would
be unable to prevent a
considerable number of
people from trying to
celebrate this year's
solstice.
A campaign of pickets,
marches and lobbying was
outlined culminating in an
advance on the festival site
from several directions
before the solstice. A mass
lobby of MPs is planned for
Thursday May 29th. Those
actually involved in
organising actions were at
pains to emphasise the
non-violent nature of their
planned action. One tactic
specificaly mentioned was
the holding of
demonstrations in Salisbury
town centre (including a
'naked protest') where it
was believed the police
were less likely to employ
agressive control methods.
In addition it is hoped
coordinated action at the
Greenham Common USAF
base will divert police from
the Stonehenge area.
One item of considerable
contention was the
accusation by the National
Trust that the festival has
resulted in considerable
archealogical damage.
Independant archeaologists
were cited as saying that
the festival is insignificant
in comparison to both the
millions of tourists who
visit the popular monument
and the activities of the
army on Salisbury Plain. It
was also pointed out that
incompetent use of
bulldozers by the police
during last years actions
did irrepairable damage to
ancient mounds.
Warren Davis a
spokesman for the National
Trust said that they hoped
to reduce damage to their
land from all possible
causes but was unable to
elaborate exactly what that
would entail. He also
admitted that the
employment last year of a
Mr Les Vaughan to provide
private security on behalf
of the local landowners had
been a serious mistake and
that the National Trust had
issued instructions that no
such measures were to be
taken this year. Les
Vaughan is a figure known
to organisations monitoring
the activities of radical
rightwing groups and has a
number of convictions for
serious crimes.
A spokesman from the
English Heritage Trust
stated that they would be
prepared to allow limited
access to the site of the
stones as long as the
question of a campsite
could be resolved. English
Heritage control the actual
monument area only and
seemed to be talking in
terms of limiting numbers
at the stones to a couple of
thousand on the basis that
this is all that the area
could reasonably hold.
However the problem of
a site on which people
could camp and on which
the customary rock
concerts could occur
seems as far from solution
as ever. The parties
concerned have indicated
their willingness to accept
as a site almost anywhere
in the general region,
however those controling
the land remain
intransigent about the
likelihood of a large
number of people arriving
in June. Don Aitken of
Festival Welfare Services
who are a charitable trust
concerned with the welfare
of participants at all types
of outdoor festivals,
expressed dismay at the
lack of compromise so far.
He stated that the majority
of festival goers would be
classified by most people
as quite normal and not the
small bunch of freaks they
are portrayed as in the
media. He went on to state
that no matter what
happened he believed a
large number of people
would try to reach the
stones in June.
A major part of the
campaign announced by
Alex Rosenberger is the
launch of a magazine
called Festival Eye which
will sell for 70p and is
aimed at promoting a more
coordinated image than
previous years. It is hoped
that the campaign, which
lists amoung its supporters
the Greenpeace
organisation, will pressurise
the authories via the media
into resuming negotiations
for a compromise festival.
From the legal point of
view it is intended to
contest injunctions being
sought against a list of
about 50 people which will
prohibit them from the
Stonehenge area. The
cases will be heard on May
13th at the High Court in
the Strand. Festivalgoers
are also investigating the
possibility of taking legal
action against the chief
constable of Wiltshire to
safeguard their right of
lawful passage on the
public highways as they
now believe that the police
overstepped the bounds of
their powers in stopping
people outside last years
injunction area.
Furthermore it was noted
that the new wide ranging
public order act will not
become law until well after
the proposed festival.
Festival Eye will be
available from The
Polytantric Circle, 99
Torriano Avenue, Camden.
Among the events leading
up to Stonehenge will be a
festival at East Wyke Farm,
Oxford on the 3rd May (this
weekend) featuring
psychadelic bands
including Dr and the
Medics and Zodiac
Mindwarp.
