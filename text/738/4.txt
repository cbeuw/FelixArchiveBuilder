New Anti-Cancer
Therapies By
The 1990's?
British biotechnology
company Celltech has
announced an agreement with
the Cyanamid Chemical .group
to develop new anti-cancer
therapies.
The problem with chemical
therapies for cancer is that the
drugs used are often
extremely toxic. The dose
required to kill the cancer
cells would also be sufficient
to kill the patient-rather
counterproductive.
What is required is some
way of getting large quantities
of cytotoxic agents (drugs to
suppress cell reproduction) to
the tumour, without circulating
throughout the body.
This is where monoclonal
antibodies (mabs) come in.
Antibodies are part of the
body's defence system. They
bind selectively to organisms
that 'invade' the body. To
exploit the specificity of
antibodies, large quantities of
single, pure antibodies,
directed against a single
invader, are required. This is
what mabs are.
The Celltech cancer therapy
is based on selection mabs
that are specific for cancer
cells, and then using the mabs
to carry drugs to the tumour.
In theory you could then
administer large dose of quite
toxic drugs, without serious
side effects. Already,
radioisotopes are being
directed into tumours using
mabs, to image the tumour,
and show it size and shape.
But a limitation of mabs so
far has been their load-
carrying capacity. When they
are load with enough drug to
kill the cancer cells , they have
tended to breakup before
reaching the target-depositing
their toxic load where it isn't
wanted
Celltech's approach will be
to identify and isolate the
smallest part of the mab that
still retains specificity for
cancer cells and then
genetically engineer these
fragments with strong bonds
to the drug.
The initial application is
likely to be in cancer of the
colon, breast and stomach;
areas that are dfficult to treat
using conventional therapy.
Celltech expects its mabs to
be able to carry imaging
agents to cancer cells by the
early 1990s, and therapeutic
agents soon after.
The Eye Research Insititue
Baltimore, US has developed
an alternative to controversial
irritancy tests on live animals.
For 40 years, the household
products and cosmetics
industries have used the
Oraize test, an eye irritancy
assay performed on albino
rabbits. The new test differs in
that it is done on living cells in
vitro. Corneal epithelial cells
are wounded mechanically,
stained, and then time-lapse
photography monitors the rate
of wound closure. If toxic
chemicals are introduced, the
rate of healing slows down,
providing a measure of the
degree of toxicity. This is not
only more socially acceptable
than the Draize test, it is also
more reliable, says the
Institute. Changes on surface
of the eye in vivo are difficult
to measure quantitiatively.

Galactic Recession
A survey designed to improve
the way astronomers calculate
the distance to elliptical
galaxies has shown large-
scale bulk motions among the
galaxies.
The survey, conducted by
seven astronomers from
all,over the world, covered 390
elliptical galaxies. It was
successful in establishing a
new distance scale for
ellipticals, accurate to 23
percent which is quite good
for cosmologists who are quite
pleased if they get the right
sign, never mind the
magnitude.
Having found out the
distance, they then used the
Hubble law to determine how
fast the galaxies were
receding from the Earth by
cosmic expansion. They then
subtracted that quantity from
the observed recession
velocity determined by the
galaxy's redshift. The
remainder is purely local
motion that indicates how the
galaxy is behaving to its
neighbours.
But these local velocities are
still relative to the velocity of
the Earth. To see how galaxies
are moving relative to the
Universe, the group next
subtracted the Earth's velocity
relative to the 3K cosmic
background radiation, 600
km/s.
The result was a bit
surprising. Clusters and
superclusters of galaxies are
streaming though the universe
at about 700 km/s. The
streaming movement appears
to be in the direction of the
Hydra Centaurus supercluster
which is moving itself. Is there
some huge undiscovered mass
on the other side? We'll have
to wait and see.
