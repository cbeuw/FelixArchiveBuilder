Our president is meant to
be a leader who can
maintain the respect of the
students, college and
outsiders alike. He is the
public face of the Imperial
College student. Miss
Diamond has carried away
with her the impression
that IC students are rude,
never sober and don't know
how to treat guests. This
my be true of Carl but it's
certainly not representative
of the rest of us.
This sort of thing has
happened before over
Southside Security and
important college
ocmmittees . When will
Carl Burgess start doing
his job, act like a President,
represent us to the best of
his ability and treat the
post as full time job and
not just an occassional
committee meeting with a
few freebies thrown in here
and there?

Dear Hugh,
Another demonstration of
positive hate for
moderation was presented
in FELIX last week. Amidst
misquotes and half-quotes
the author mentioned my
name with total contempt
five times. This
unprecedented attack was
truly the work of an
extremist. To scoff at such
'far reaching, though
insufficient reforms' (which
were my actual words Mr
Dunlop) as the abolition of
the Pass Laws and the
Immorality Act is typical of
an extremist dedicated to
the violent overthrow of the
SA Government by the
Marxist, Soviet-backed
ANC. In fact, these reforms
struck the whole heart out
of the apartheid system.
But why didn't you
answer the real questions
in my letter Mr Dunlop?
What about the effect on
other Southern African
countries? Should we
preserve the highest black
standard of living in Africa?
And should we cease
economic cooperation with
a developing country?
And the ultimate
absurdity was, Mr Dunlop,
YOU telling ME about
democracy. Well, quite
frankly I don't believe you
give a damn about
democracy. Perhaps this is
because democracy and
capitalism work too well
together to accommodate
your support for violent
Marxist terrorism.
It is time to take an
uninhibited look at
apartheid. The traditional
image of it as an extreme
right wing philosophy is
false. More accurately it
can be described as ethnic
socialism, a system
involving state control
down to every last detail.
Implementation of the
correspondingly policies
have traditionally drawn
many parallels with other
extreme socialist states.
This is totally incompatible
with liberation capitalist
values of multinationals
such as Barclays. It is in
their best interests, and
their inherent nature to
destroy apartheid. They
canot exist in a system of
inherited racial division
which inhibits freedom of
movement and labour and
requires them to be
subservient to the state.
The aim of the A N C
which is no longer
interested in negotiated
settlement is to seek a
solution by force. They, like
you Mr Dunlop, wish to
force SA blacks to
revolution, and are
correspondingly terrorising
the black SA population to
militancy with a campaign
of muggings and murder of
their own people. If this
terror campaign succeeds,
helped along by
disinvestment, extremists
will have won the race and
the attempts to get rid of
apartheid will be
abandoned. Don't vote for
more extremism in SA
they've had enough
already.
Finally Mr Dunlop,
answer me this which bank
in SA.
1 Donates 5% of its
earnings to a social
responsibility programme
for the benefit of the black
community?
2 Opened the first branch
in Soweto-against the law?
3 Appointed the fist black
cashier in SA-against the
Law?
4 Appointed the first black
manager-against the law?
5 Established multi-racial
training-against the law.
6 Was the first bank in SA
to introduce equal pay for
equal work?
7 Represents 25% of SA
banking system but
employs 43% of the total
number of non-whites in
banking?
(PS its not the 'volsikas'
bank which employs 1%)
Yes Mr Dunlop, its the one
you love to hate,
B A R C L A Y S National
Yours sincerely
John Martin
