Burgess Offends At Record Rap Fete
'Smashed Out
Of His Brain'
EH
Union President, Carl Burgess
has described reports that he
was offensive to guests at Rag
Fete as 'absolutely ridiculous'.
Many of the guests at the
Rector's reception for guests
and organisers of the Fete
described his performance as
disgusting.
RCS VP elect Judith Hackney
has described in a letter to
FELIX how Mr Burgess was
'rude, incoherent, agressive and
a total embarassment to the rest
of the reception'. Other guests
at the reception have also told
FELIX that Ms Hackney's
description was accurate.
RCS Union Broadsheet's Ultra
Viscous Rumours and Dirty Lies
column also describes Carl as
being 'smashed out of his
brain'. Carl dismissed the report
as gossip.
Mr Burgess told FELIX
yesterday that he was only
'slightly innebriated' and that he
had received no complaints
about his conduct.
Rag Record
Rag Fete on Saturday raised a
record amount of money. The
total raised came to £1804.51 at
the first count, though Rag
Chairman elect Man Tai said
that money was still coming in.
This was double what was
raised last year.
The Fete was opened at 2pm
in brilliant sunlight by TV-AM's
Ann Diamond. Ms Diamond and
the Rector, Prof Ash toured the
Fete.
Man Tai wishes to thank
everyone who made the day
such a success especially the
Christian Union members who
helped ail day and Duo and the
Beat Bandits who gave their
services for free.
Guilds Stunt
A Guilds shield was placed at
the top of the Queen's Tower by
some of the Guilds students
who were helping to organise
trips up the Tower. It was finally
removed on Tuesday.

IC Tops Tables
Imperial College is rated tops
for Physics and Mechanical
Engineering by employers,
according to a survey carried
out by the Sunday Times. But
the survey also shows that
graduates often lack the
communication and business
skills that employers are looking
for.
In the survey of 450
employers of graduates
previewed in the Sunday Times
on April 27, Imperial is placed
first for Physics ahead of
Cambridge and Oxford, and for
Mechanical Engineering ahead
of Loughborough and Brunei.
The College does not make the
top ten for Computing,
however, with the honours
going to Manchester and
UMIST. The accompanying
article concentrates on new
innovations in engineering
courses at Loughborough and
Brunei, such as thin sandwich
courses and the involvement of
industrialists, without
mentioning IC. The full results
will published in The Sunday
Times Good University Guide in
July.
Most employers feel that
graduates lack both knowledge
of and interest in the world of
business and commerce, the
survey shows. They are
described as inarticulate,
tongue-tied and even illiterate,
with complaints that they lack
initiative and the 'real go-getter
killer instinct' that industry
needs. The employers call for
graduates to be trained to
communicate better, to take
decisions and provide
leadership so called
'transferable skills'—applicable
to all areas of industry.
Concern over the
Government's education policy
is widely voiced in the survey.
Employers feel that they need
an increasing supply of
graduates and are alarmed at
the threat of cuts in student
numbers. The new innovations
in courses needed to answer
the criticisms of employers will
also require resources, which
are not being made available.
The clear message is that
industry needs an increase in
both the quality and quantity of
graduates if it is to become
more competitive.
