In some respects it seems a
little odd that University
Students, of all people,
should be thought to need
a range of support services
which are more
comprehensive, better
staffed and more accessible
than those available to their
peer group outside.
Virtually all universities
have an extensive medical
service, staffed by doctors
and nurses who put a high
value on talking to their
patients-hardly an image of
general practice which
would be recognisable to
the consumers of National
Health Service medicine in
the country at large. Most
universities have well
staffed student services
unit where practical advise
and help are available on
demand, and where
students can expect
assistance and sometimes
advocacy in their dealings
with bureaucracy. Most
universities, including this
one, have appointed
Counsellors whose brief, in
essence, is an open-ended
committment to helping
students with personal
problems. Again the
contrast with the world
outside academia is very
great. How can we justify
this inequitble allocation of
scarce resources in favour
of most articulate,
intelligent, and able sector
of the school leaving
population.
Another way of phrasing
the question perhaps, is
this—What is so special
about University students?
There are two sorts of
answers I believe. The
j more tendentious and value
| laden one involes the
j economic argument that
University entrants are
themselves a scarce
resources and that as an
advanced thechnology
based society we are fully
justified, even obliged, to
afford them extra support
and protection. This view,
(of higher educational
provision generally) is
enthusiastically embraced
by the middle classes, and
is compliantly tolerated by
the working classes. The
other sort of answer, and
the one I am most
interested in, concerns the
peculiar nature of a
students occupation, that is
sustained, systematic and
high level learning, and the
interaction, between the
learning process and
anxiety, distress and other
emotional disturbances. I
do not believe that on the
whole the contingent life '
problems that student have
to cope with are
significantly different to
those of the rest of their
age group-indeed it can
reasonably be supposed
that they will not, on
average, be as bad. To be
sure there are some
occupational hazards which
are associated with the
intellectual high flyer, for
Other common, but less
obvious sources of distress
and anxiety may also
undermine the capacity to
study in a highly insidious
way.
For example, the student
who finds it difficult to
make friends, or who feels
Student Counsellor
example academic
excellence may have to be
attained partly at the cost
of the neglect of other sorts
of skills, particularly social
skills, and it may be true
also that some kinds of
stress, inseperable from
university study are not
risks to which non students
are exposed.
The residual, but solid,
justification for professional
helping services in
universites is the degree to
which the students central
activity-study-is impaired
by factors which would be
far less disabling in terms
of efficency for another
persons whose occupation
was serving in a shop,
digging holes in the road or
working behind a bank
counter, A bereavement, a
broken love relationship, or
a parental divorce, is
equally traumatic for
eveyrone, and the
immediate emotional
impact is precisely the
same. For the university
student however, and
particularly perhaps for
students at Colleges like
this, where the work is
cumulative and sequential,
even a relativeley short
period of distress related
inefficiency can have a
quite disproportionate
effect.
in other ways out of step
with what he perceives as
normal, may find some of
the more mechanical tasks
associated with his work
quite easy to cope with, but
find it virtually impossible
to sit and concentrate on
work that requires abstract
thinking. 'I can't
concentrate', 'my mind
wanders off onto other
things'; 'I spend hours just
looking at my notes, taking
nothing in'; are phrases
which are very familiar to
those whose job it is to
help students.
The individual colouring
of this sort of study
problem can be infinitely
varied, but in practise there
are some well recognised
patterns into which most
people fit quite easily.
Besides the sort of
problems already
mentioned—the fracture or
threat to key relationships,
and the difficulties
engendered by isolation
and the fears associated
with it-l have in mind such
problems as anxieties
about one's choice of
course, and possibly about
the next move in life, now
that all the more or less
prescribed ones are at an
end. Coping with the
competitiveness in
academic work and
learning to recognise their
appropriateness or
otherwise of level of degree
one hopes to achieve.
Coping with the emotional
demands of other students
and friends and finding
some sort of forumla for
dealing with the more
negative aspects of human
behaviour. There are also
the mundane worries about
money and
accommodation, about the
planning of one's time and
the need to recognise the
time and energy are finite
resources and that
invidious choices have to
be made.
There is no doubt that for
all these sorts of difficulty,
and many others, there is
much to be said for talking
to someone about them.
People generally, but
scientists and technologists
particularly perhaps, tend
to underestimate the simple
value of talking. Many of
us, at times of difficulty
almost automatically turn in
on ourselves-particulary
out of pride (the powerful
impulse to keep up an
appearance of
competence), and partly
out of the inappropriate
rational arguement that
talking cannot change hard
reality, cannot alter the
substantive roots of our
unhappiness, cannot alter
'the facts'.
Talking is important and
effective however in a
number of ways. Firstly it
enables people to express,
and therefore to ventilate
their (often angry) feelings.
Providing this is done in
the right sort of setting,
and with the right sort of
response, it helps to
liberate the energy required
to tackle real life difficulties
constructively. Secondly it
is often only by taking
about things that we are
able to sort out one strand
from another and make
some sort of coherent
picture of the situation.
Thirdly, this more or less
conscious sharing of
feelings may very well lead
to new ideas, new
information, new initiatives
for tackling problems.
There are many people in
College to whom students
can talk-colleagues and
friends of course, but also
college staff-tutors,
doctors, student services
staff. You can also talk to
me. I am not paid to do
anything else, and my work
is entirely confidential. If
you would like to see me,
my office is in the
basement of 15, Princes
Gardens, and my telephone
no is 3041.
