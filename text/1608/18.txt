So how happy are Imperial
students with their sex lives?
Cecily Johnson summarises your sexual satisfaction
Overall, 62% of us are ‘happy’
or ‘very happy’ with our sex
lives at Imperial. Only 21%
reported that they were ‘unhappy’
or ‘very unhappy’ (sorry folks), while
15% didn’t feel one way or the other.
The remaining 2% did not wish to
say how they felt – so it’s anyone’s
guess why they’re filling out a student
sex survey.
Breaking the figures down by the
sexuality of respondents revealed
some interesting trends in our levels
of sexual satisfaction.
72% of those identifying as asexual
said they were ‘happy’ or ‘very happy’
with their sex lives, with only 14%
‘unhappy’ or ‘very unhappy’.
Bisexuals were the second happiest,
with 71% reportedly ‘happy’ or ‘very
happy’ and only 21% ‘unhappy’ or
‘very unhappy’.
Next most satisfied were the
heterosexuals, 64% of whom were on
the happy end of the spectrum, while
21% again were ‘unhappy’ or ‘very
unhappy’.
Meanwhile, only 54% of Imperial’s
homosexuals were ‘happy’ or ‘very
happy’ with their sex lives, and this
time 23% not happy – perhaps due to
the relatively low number of gay and
lesbian students at Imperial (only 8%
of us according to this year’s survey).
Looking at gender, 73% of Imperial
women were ‘happy’ or ‘very happy’
with their sex life at the moment,
compared to just 58% of the men.
Similarly the ‘unhappy’ and ‘very
unhappy’ students accounted for 17%
of the girls and 24% of guys. So nearly
1 in 4 blokes aren’t being satisfied at
Imperial – sorry lads.
Comparing the happiness figures
by department with the total
number of respondents from that
department, it looks like Medicine
are overrepresented in the ‘very
unhappy’ category with a whopping
23% of them identifying as such when
just 15% of total respondents were
Medics.
Life Sciences were also less than
satisfied, making up 23% of the
‘unhappy’ category yet only 17% of
total respondents.
Meanwhile Physics were
underrepresented here, with only
10% ‘very unhappy’, and the rest
slightly more likely than average to
be in the happy categories. Physicists
made up 17% of total survey
respondents. You go, Physicists.
Maths were doing well too, as just

6% of total respondents with 9% of all
those students self-reporting as ‘very
happy’ with their sex lives.
But is Imperial affecting your
chances of sexual satisfaction? Or
vice versa, is your sex life impacting
on your studies? Well, a significant
proportion of you – 44% – don’t
really think coming to Imperial has
affected your sex life at all.
30% of students felt that Imperial
has had a positive effect on their sex
life, whilst 24% of you felt that there
was an overall negative effect on your
sexual satisfaction. Not enough time
spent in Metric, or too much perhaps?
Speaking of Metric, do Imperial
students feel like they have enough
time to meet people whilst keeping
up with their studies? 69% of you said
yes, with 24% responding no and 7%
opting not to answer this one.
On the other hand, it seems like
most of you aren’t blaming Imperial
entirely for any dissatisfaction – 58%
don’t think their sex life (or lack
thereof) has impacted on their level of
student satisfaction.
23% of students felt positively
about Imperial’s influence on their
satisfaction, whilst only 16% thought
that their sex life at Imperial had a
negative impact.
Finally we wondered whether
anything else is affecting your sex
lives here, so we asked “do cultural
and/or religious reasons affect
your sex life?”. A huge 83% of you
responded ‘no’, and 8% ‘no, but my
family would be mad if they found
out’.
However 3% of you don’t believe
in any sort of sexual activity before
marriage, while 1% only want to
engage in certain types of sexual
activity before marriage and 4% only
want to have sexual activity in a long-
term relationship.
