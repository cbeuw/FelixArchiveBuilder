This week at Imperial Cinema
it’s a double bill of high-octane,
critically acclaimed action films,
as Fast&Furious7 roars onto the
screen alongside Keanu Reeves
in JohnWick.
Following directly on
from 2013’sFast&Furious6
(surprisingly,this is how sequels
work),Fast&Furious7 deals with
the fallout from the crew’s offing
of terrorist Owen Shaw (Luke
Evans).After separating and
returning to calmer lives,the
crew are forced back together
after Shaw’s older brother
Deckard (Jason Statham)
crashes onto the scene.Intent on
revenge,Deckard hunts the crew
to the ends of the earth,with
lethal consequences if he catches
them.
The Fast&Furiouscrew aren’t
the only ones being forced out of
retirement this week.Legendary
assassin John Wick (Keanu
Reeves) left behind his life of
paid murder after falling in love,
only to lose his wife suddenly.
Her last gift to him,a beagle
puppy,and his precious car are
the only things he has left to care
for in the world.When a sadistic
thug (Alfie Allen) takes a liking
to the car,and kills the puppy in
the process of stealing it,John
unleashes a wave of terrifying
vengeance.

Mockingjay Part 2 poster
finally arrives
The final, final entry in the
Hunger Games series has
quietly started its marketing
campaign, with a new poster for
Mockingjay – Part 2 making an
appearance.
It’s nothing excessively exciting,
featuring a decapitated statue of
Donald Sutherland’s evil President
Coriolanus Snow, alongside a huge,
graffiti mural of the Mockingjay logo.
Following on, perhaps
unsurprisingly, from the events
of Part 1, with Katniss Everdeen
(Jennifer Lawrence) leading the
charge on the Capitol, Part 2 promises
to be the big, action-heavy climax
to the series, but still boasting the
vicious political commentary that
helped elevate the other films.
With the likes of Josh Hutcherson,
Liam Hemsworth, Julianne Moore,
Sam Claflin and Elizabeth Banks
all making appearances in Francis
Lawrence’s (no relation to the
star) third adaptation of Suzanne
Collins’ novels, Part 2 shows little
sign of being the weak link in one of
cinema’s strongest franchises.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -
Part 2 explodes into cinemas on 20th
November.

Man finishes first draft of
script
James Gunn, the man
(predominantly) responsible for last
year’s official Greatest Marvel Film
Known to Mankind (Until Age of
Ultron)™ has completed his first draft
of the script for the sequel.
He took to Twitter to let the
world know, adding a casual
#NotEventheTitle to the photo.
Considering the visible title is
Guardians of the Galax, who knows
what the rest of the title could hold
in store.
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (or
whatever it’s eventually called, there’s
bound to be a subtitle if Marvel get
their way) is due to hit cinemas on
28th
April, 2017. UK cinemas, anyway.
The Americans don’t get it until 5th
May.
Oh, and yes, the Awesome Mix
#2 songs are already picked. Gunn
confirmed he’s written them into the
screenplay.
Yes, this is a news story. Stop
judging. Go away.
Sony is weirdly indifferent to
losing Bond
The rights to the James Bond
franchise are up in the air after the
next film, SPECTRE, and that means
one thing: a bidding war for one of
the most profitable (and longest
running) film series in existence.
Sony are currently responsible for
distributing the franchise, which
is controlled by MGM (and Eon
Productions), but that’s not always
been the case. Paramount have
previously held talks with MGM over
taking control of the franchise, while
there are now rumours of Warner
Bros making moves on Mr Bond.
With that whole profitable/famous/
long-running thing in contention,
you’d expect current rights holders
Sony to care a little more about losing
their biggest horse in the stable (not
least with their Spider-Man franchise
now being shared with Marvel).
Not so, if chief Sony man Tom
Rothman (who replaced former boss
Amy Pascal following that Sony
hacking scandal) is to be believed.
Speaking to Variety, Rothman
said: “The reality is that Sony’s
had a fantastic run with the Bonds.
Sure, we’re going to compete for
[the rights], but let’s be honest, so is
everybody in the business.”
Well, he’s not wrong.
Tangled gets its own TV
series in 2017
That’s right, the 2010 re-telling of the
story of Rapunzel is heading on over
to TV.
The 50th
feature-length film to come
out of Disney’s studios, bringing
with it the original leads, Mandy
Moore and Zachary Levi, as well as
the real stars of the film: Pascal the
chameleon and Maximus the horse.
The show is set to take place
between events of the film and its
follow-up short (Tangled Ever After).
It’ll also feature music from Alan
Menken and lyrics from Glenn Slater,
the pair that handled musical duties
first time around.
Tangled: The TV Series (or whatever
Disney elect to call it) will be
dropping onto the Disney Channel
sometime in 2017.
Disney greenlights Fantasia,
but cans Tron 3
Disney’s had a pretty decent run
with its live-action adaptations of its
classic properties. Maleficent, while
being a fairly mediocre film, managed
a fairly hefty box office draw, while
this year’s Cinderella managed a
double victory of receiving rave
reviews and making decent money.
Disney have plenty more
adaptations on their slate, including
Dumbo (oh God) and The Jungle Book
(one of two films essentially based on
that book in the works).
They’ve now added another one, in
the form of Fantasia.
Specifically, one sequence from
Fantasia, a film well-known for
its lack of overarching story, plot,
recurring characters, or in fact any
noticeable features beyond some
delightful animated sequences set to
various classical music.
The sequence in question is Night
on Bald Mountain, the part with the
winged demon and the dancing
dead things and such like. It’s also 11
minutes long.
Fantasia is in the hands of Matt
Sazama and Burk Sharpless, the guys
behind Dracula Untold. Answers as
to how on earth they’re going to a)
manage this and b) not do it terribly
on a postcard, if you please.
