32 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

know why you had to draw that
distinction.
Methods of contraception
This section almost made Hangman
break down and cry. Even we know
you should use protection (we’re
tying contraception and protection
together here, for reasons).
Consider that Hangman’s one
legitimate tip from this whole
enterprise. Use protection.
Once we’ve scaled the mountain
of people pointing out that their
homosexuality renders contraception
pointless (yes, thank you, we get
the point, it was a badly designed
question), there was the odd case
of people who Hangman is slightly
concerned about.
So, naturally, Hangman is going to
reproduce their comments verbatim
and be sarcastic about them, because
that’s just how we roll.
Someone’s method of contraception
is “thinking of Margaret Thatcher
when [they] ejaculate.” Hangman
hates to break it to you: that’s not
what contraception is. That’s what a
turn-off is. These are different things.
Hangman congratulates you on
the impending birth of your many
children.
Several people claimed abstinence
as their contraceptive of choice.
Congrats. This feels like stating the
obvious.
Several others made the obvious
joke of “being at Imperial” (one was
more specific, targeting the Electronic
Engineering department for some
virgin banter).
Look. Read the damn sex survey.
Normally, Hangman wouldn’t
care about the sex survey.
Most of Imperial are a bunch
of virgins, some of Imperial aren’t,
the world keeps turning. Hangman
remains, unfazed, eternal.
But this year’s sex survey was so
full of utter depravity, wild sexual
abandon and frankly horrifying
admissions that Hangman felt
compelled to speak out.
Hangman even felt compelled to
write this article.
And let Hangman just say: you’re
all disgusting. Hangman loves it.
Quite a few of you sickening sex
addicts had comments for Felix.
Some of you wanted to let us know
what other disturbing things you get
up to.
Others took the chance to tell us
what sort of contraception they use
when getting their freak on. Others
tried to proposition Felix.
Others were just downright
perverts.
Let’s take a closer look, as Hangman
puts on our Agony Aunt hat (we
knitted it ourselves), and introduces
you to - for one issue only - ‘Sex Tips’
(but just the tips).
Types of porn
You people watch some horrifying
crap. Anyway.
When it came to porn, Felix asked
you what sort of thing you enjoyed
watching (you sick bastards).
Then they made the mistake of
giving you a free text answer box for
you to add in anything they’d missed,
knowing full well you’d fill the box
with all sorts of sick nonsense.
Which you promptly did, because
you’re nothing if not predictable.
Said one commentator: “anything is
porn if you try hard enough.”
This is stunning life advice, truth
be told.
It feels like the sort of thing you’d
see on an inspirational cat poster, if
inspirational cat posters were written
by filthy porn addicts.
Hangman suggests you all take this
advice to heart. Hey, nobody said this
was going to be useful sex tips.
Another commentator took a
different approach to life, asking
“how the fuck could you fap to
animated hentai with the fucking
voice acting?”
Hangman would like to refer this
individual to the comment above.
Anything is porn if you try hard
enough.
There was also some extremely
useful feedback on the survey, with
someone pointing out that “you
should have separated MILF from
Mature.”
Hangman doesn’t even want to
Sex Tips (but just the tips)

News in Brief: Hangman filled out the sex survey. We’re
the one with 999 sexual partners.
Remember that Agony Aunt column? This isn’t that.
It very clearly shows that people
at Imperial have sex, so the people
making a general “Imperial” joke are
all wrong.
It also clearly shows that Aero, not
EE, are the biggest virgins, so at least
get your departmental-percentage-of-
virgins-based jokes right. Honestly.
One person made a terrible joke
that’s so unacceptable even Hangman
refuses to print it. You know who you
are.
And finally on the subject of
contraception, Hangman would like
to give a shout out to whoever wrote
“I will use a condom in future.”
Hangman feels this belies a
rudimentary failure of your reading
comprehension abilities.
This isn’t a survey about the sex
you’re hoping to have, it’s about the
sex you’ve already had.
Of course, saying that, Hangman
is pleased to hear you’re making the
sensible decision with regards to
costuming your genitals in protective
latex during consensual copulation,
and wishes you the very best of sex in
the future.
Funky fornication habits
Oh dear. Hangman thought the
Margaret Thatcher reference in the
previous section was bad enough,
but no, you had to go and surpass
yourselves, didn’t you?
The additional comments for
‘anything else you like doing [in
sex, not in general]?’ proved to be a
treasure trove of debauchery.
“Sheep,” said one person. No
context, just “sheep.” They like doing
sheep.
If you’re suspecting this is going
to turn out to be a Welsh joke, well
done, because that’s exactly what it
was. “#welshlad,” went the rest of the
comment. Wonderful. Never saw
that one coming (and neither did the
sheep).
Someone else felt the overwhelming
urge to query Felix’s knowledge of sex,
pointing out that they indulge in the
odd spot of autofellatio, and asking
“how could you forget!” Quite easily,
it seems.
“People don’t hugely appreciate it
when you ask them if you can sanitise
their ass” might actually qualify as
legitimate advice? Hangman’s not
sure anymore.
The line between acceptable and not
becomes blurred very, very quickly
when you’re dealing with the level of
wanton licentiousness we’re talking
about here.
Other helpful tidbits include “rusty
pirate is not as fun as it sounds”
(Hangman’s not convinced it sounded
fun to start with) and “wanking while
blazed” being given as a fun activity
to try.
Hangman would appreciate the
advice, were it not plain weird.
And finally: this.
Many, many, many people expressed
their determination to Get It On
Down Under™ (sorry not sorry,
Australia) following the sex survey
querying whether anyone had
actually managed to enjoy some
cheeky coitus in the tunnels running
underneath the South Kensington
campus.
You are, it seems, all obsessed with
these tunnels. Hangman has a few
responses to this, so let’s break it
down.
Firstly, Hangman is delighted to
be able to offer the Get It On Down
Under™ Experience, for a mere £9000
(per year), where you too can get it on
(down under).
Email hangman@imperial.ac.uk to
express your interest, with “I’ll let
you service my tunnels” as the subject
line.
Secondly, sex in the tunnels is a
terrible idea.
Half of them have caved in, and
most of the rest have burning hot
pipes running through them that’ll
melt your face off if you even go near.
Sex in the tunnels will end badly.
Hangman’s honour.
There was plenty of solicitations
to the Felix staff, with a vast array of
spelling and grammar abilities.
The winner of the
‘straightwhiteboystexting.tumblr.
com’ award for Worst Proposition
Ever is whoever sent in ‘ay bb u wan
sum fuk’. No, no we don’t. Not with
spelling like that.
One bellend also suggested Felix
should hold a “rear of the year
contest.” We’re not The Tab, mate.
Jog on.
As for “this survey was a lot filthier
than anticipated,” you were a lot
filthier than anticipated. So now you
know how we feel.
And finally: to whoever’s love for
circular confecitonary was so great
they had to tell Felix: Hangman has
some brief advice for you.
You “like donuts,” okay. That’s
great. Just don’t stick your dick in
them.
