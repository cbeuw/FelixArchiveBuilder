you choose one because it feels right
at one point in time, it is perfectly
okay (and relatively common) to
change it if it doesn’t seem to fit later.
A person’s traits can change over
time. In recognition of this, some
“genderfluid” people exist, meaning
that these aspects of their identity are
in more constant flux.
Labels
The most important thing about
labels is that they’re descriptive,
not prescriptive (and certainly not
proscriptive). The fact that someone
decides that a label applies to them at
one point in time doesn’t place a limit
on what they can be, but it can be a
useful way to convey a set of traits.
The second-most-important thing
is that because these things are core
aspects of someone’s identity, they
have the final say on whether a
given label applies. If someone says
a sexuality- or gender-related label
doesn’t apply to them, it doesn’t apply
to them. They know their identity
better than you do, after all. Policing
someone else’s identity is the height
of rudeness.
This is by no means an exhaustive
list of concepts or terms, but it is a
good place to start. If you’re curious
about these concepts, about part of
someone’s identity, or are exploring
your own, that’s okay, but you
need to be respectful in how you
ask questions. People don’t have
an obligation to tell you things,
especially when those things are very
complex and intensely personal.
Try to think carefully about your
questions and wording, so that you
do not offend or upset someone
unintentionally. Bear in mind that
the people whom you are questioning
are first and foremost emotional
human beings who have a right to
privacy and respect.
