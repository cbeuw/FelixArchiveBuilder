According to students’newspaper
TheHarvardCrimson,which recently
conducted a survey of the Harvard
University graduating class,25%
of students didn’t have sex whilst
studying at their University.
In comparison,at Imperial only
16% of our Felix survey respondents
remain virgins.
At Harvard 21% of students lost
their virginity in their first year,
whilst here at Imperial 23% of
people lost their virginity aged 18,
and a further 13% lost it aged 19–
the typical ages of those students in
first year.
Last year TheStudentBeans
reported that Imperial students
had an average of 5.8 partners and
The Tab reported an average of 8.6.
We found that on average,
Imperial students had 3.8 sexual
partners.
Harvard reports that 19% of
male students and 7% of female
students had more than 10
partners,whilst here at Imperial
11% of students had 11 or more
partners.
At Harvard,45% of men watch
porn multiple times each week,
whilst 80% of male Imperial
respondents confessed to watching
porn.
Women,it seems,are more
consistent across the pond–with
Harvard reporting that 56% of
women have never watched porn,
whilst at Imperial 61% of female
students said they don’t watch
porn.
At Imperial only 31% of
respondents rely on condoms for
protection,whilst at Harvard this
rises to 43%.
31% of Harvard students confess
to only sometimes,rarely,or never
using a condom–compared to our
own 65% of students who have had
unprotected sex.

How does Imperial compare to elsewhere?
Cecily Johnson on the stories behind your statuses
According to this year’s survey
data, just 41% of Imperial
students are single or “not
seeing anyone” exclusively. A
surprisingly high 46% of you are
in an exclusive relationship at the
moment, and 8% are seeing someone
but “non-exclusively”.
4% are seeing multiple people (get
you), while 1% did not wish to say.
So as a group we seem to like our
monogamy, but do we love it?
We asked all of you “would you
say you are in love?” and 37% of
respondents said yes. Most of you
haven’t been hit by cupid’s arrow
though, with 46% saying no. 3% did
not wish to answer this question.
The final 13% of students did not
wish to say whether they are in love at
the moment, which is fair enough –
these figures do include both those in
relationships and singletons.
Interestingly, just 69% of those of
you in exclusive relationships feel
that you are in love. 12% answered
“no” (ouch), and 14% said “maybe”.
This time 5% did not wish to say.
Maybe distance is getting in the way
of things? Of those in relationships,
30% of you are in long-distance
relationships, which we all know can
be hard.
Looking closer to home though,
we asked “are you currently in
a relationship with an Imperial
student” and 47% of those who
answered the question said yes. 50%
of you said no, and the remaining 3%
did not wish to say.
Out of the total respondents,
not just those in relationships, we
wondered whether you have ever been
in a relationship with an Imperial
student in the past – and only 32%
said yes.
66% of you have not dated within
Imperial (something wrong with us?
Not good enough for you?) and 2%
did not wish to say (come on guys,
it was a pretty straight question this
time!).
So where are those of you with an
Imperial boyfriend or girlfriend
meeting them? The most common
place was “in halls”, with 34% of
you picking up a partner on your
doorstep.
We were glad to see the next most
popular was “at a club/society/
project” – apparently 22% of you are
finding time to reap the benefits of
those extracurricular activities.
Your courses are also providing
opportunities to meet people, with
17% of respondents pairing up with
someone from among their degree
coursemates.
12% of you are meeting people
“via friends” (kudos to the wingmen/
ladies) and 4% at parties outside the
Union. Another 4% met their partner
at the Union or a Union-hosted event.
Just 2% of you found your
girlfriend or boyfriend on a dating
or hookup service such as Tinder or
OKCupid. Maybe they’re just more
suited to one night stands?
We also asked which of these dating
apps and websites you’re using. 53%
of you claim to have never tried any
of these kinds of services, but of those
who have given them a shot Tinder
was the clear favourite with 43% of
respondents having tried out the app.
Despite only 8% of total
respondents identifying as
homosexual and 9% as bisexual, a
whopping 39% of you claim to have
had a play with Grindr.
10% of students are on OKCupid
and 6% have given Happn a go.
Another 8% of you have tried out
other apps and sites that we did not
manage to list.
One thing Felix always likes to
ask you about is your relationships
with Hall Seniors. Out of all survey
respondents, 4% claim to have had a
relationship during first year with a
Senior in their own hall and 1% dated
a Hall Senior from another hall.
Finally, we asked you all about
cheating. 74% of you say you’ve never
cheated on a partner (yay!) while 23%
are admitting to it (boo!). As usual the
last 3% did not wish to say.
On the other side of the coin, 74%
again say that to their knowledge they
have not been cheated on themselves.
Just 18% say they’ve definitely been
cheated on and a further 6% think it
may have happened but they aren’t
sure.
So there you have it, folks – seems
like plenty of you are doing pretty
well for yourselves. Thanks to all of
you for filling out the survey and do
come back next year with even more
stories for our stats!
