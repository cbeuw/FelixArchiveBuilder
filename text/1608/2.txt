This week we’ve finally released
the findings of the fifth annual
sex survey. The survey was
first launched back in 2011, with
the findings released as part of the
coverage to coincide with Valentine’s
day. Nowadays the survey has taken
on a role of its own as part of Felix and
this year is no exception.
We ran the survey over the course
of last term, and collected data about
your preferences, your kinks, your
concerns and, for the adventurous
few, wherabouts on campus you’ve
done the deed.
We had a great response this year
with nearly 600 students sharing all
their sex secrets. This year we have
also investigated the romantic lives
of those at Imperial, along with the
usual questions concerning your bits
and bobs and everything inbetween.
It was most interesting to note, as
it is every year, that in general most
people seem to be pretty happy with
their sex lives, regardless of how
much they may or may not be getting.
After the doom and gloom of the
Mentality survey last week, this data
was a lot more pleasant to analyse,
discuss and dissect.
The coverage would not have been
possible without the hours put in by
Cecily Johnson, Jack Steadman, Nick
Farmer and Ben Howitt poring over
your responses and finding out just
what makes you tick (or not as the
case may be for certain acts). Thanks
to Diba Esbati for collecting content
from the LGBT+ community, and
other members of the team who have
lent a hand when putting together
ideas for the coverage on the whole.
The survey itself would not be
possible if it not were for Philip Kent
who ran the technical side of the
operation, alongside the rest of the
Felix team who contributed to the
brainstorming session beforehand
discussing what we wanted to find
out this year. Also thanks to everyone
who shared the survey online.
But finally this data was only
possible due to you, the readers,
taking the time out to fill our long
and sometimes scary survey in. We
hope you enjoy our eight page pull-
out [insert sex pun here]. Apologies,
it has been a long week staring at
bar graphs, pie charts, and drawing
coloured vectors of condoms.
