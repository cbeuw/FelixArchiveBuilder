With a referendum on the horizon, James Bezer looks at what effect
‘Brexit’ could have on research in Britain
What has the EU ever done for science?
Everyone hates the EU.
According to many
commentators, it’s a bloated,
money-grabbing gravy-train full
of unelected ‘Eurocrats’ whose sole
desire is to impose their evil will
on Britain’s hardworking citizens
through ludicrous laws demanding
our shops sell unsettlingly
straight bananas and feed useless
homeopathic medicine to Britain’s
hardworking farm animals.
No wonder David Cameron wants a
referendum.
But as the possibility of a British
exit (or ‘Brexit’) becomes more likely,
more and more voices are calling for
us to stay in. Despite its flaws and the
need for reform, arguments favouring
the economic benefits have come
from major organisations such as the
Confederation of British Industry .
The opposition to ‘Brexit’ has also
come from key figures in British
science, who have argued against
cutting our ties with the research
powerhouses on the continent.
Whatever you might think about
the EU, it remains undeniable
that ‘Brexit’ would have profound
consequences across almost every
aspect of life in our country, and that
includes science and technology.
To us at Imperial at least, probably
the most obvious effect the EU has
is in encouraging large numbers of
European students and researchers
to work and study in other countries
through programmes like Erasmus.
Last year 25,000 Erasmus students
studied in the UK, and more than
15,000 British students studied in
other European countries. According
to HESA, there were 125,000 EU
students in the UK in 2013/14
compared to nearly 300,000 from
outside the EU. It seems the tougher
immigration rules for non-EU
migrants don’t act as a deterrent.
Mike Galsworthy, a visiting
researcher at LSHTM, has started
‘Scientists4EU’, a campaign to
promote the role the EU plays
in British science. It has already
attracted support from key names
including Nobel Laureate Sir Paul
Nurse, and Astronomer Royal Lord
Rees, former President of the Royal
Society.
Galsworthy expects that, in the
event of ‘Brexit’, key benefits from
membership could be put at risk by
changes to immigration policy.
“This is where the Swiss are now,”
he says. “They used to buy into the
EU science programmes and do
extremely well from them. But then
by a slim margin they decided on
tougher anti-immigration rules.
“Without free flow of people, they
could not participate in Erasmus
and major parts of Horizon 2020
funding because allowing Swiss free
movement anywhere in the EU, but
EU students and researchers limited
entry into Switzerland, clashes with
the whole ethos of those programmes.
This has caused Swiss science huge
headaches that they are scrambling to
deal with now.”
Science is one of the few areas in
which the UK gets a disproportionate
share of EU funding, amounting to
over a billion euros between 2007 and
2014. This is because it is allocated
on excellence, and science is an area
Britain truly excels at. It remains
the case, however, that in total, the
UK pays more money into the EU
than it receives in direct subsidies.
UKIP argue that this money could be
redistributed, giving more funding to
many areas, including research.
“That money would have a lot less
value when UK is not at the centre of
the world’s largest scientific engine,”
says Galsworthy. “The EU’s scientific
output is 20% higher than the US and
Europe is becoming a global brand
in how you do multi-national ‘big’
science. Leaving the EU would reduce
the power of our institutions to set
global agendas. UK science reputation
and power would start to wane.”
One of the major arguments in
favour of an EU exit made by UKIP
has been that it would lift stifling
regulations imposed on British
industry by people in Brussels. UKIP
doesn’t have a science spokesperson,
but when asked about its science
policy by the Campaign for Science
and Engineering, they argued
that ‘Brexit’ would benefit British
science by cutting these unnecessary
regulations.
“In our opinion, [regulations] have
been unnecessarily restrictive when it
comes to research and have hampered
smaller-scale research projects which
cannot get off the ground because of
the cost of the weight of regulation
they will have to comply with. I
give by way of example the Clinical
Trials Directive. This was intended
to simplify and harmonise clinical
trials across the EU, but has in fact
decimated the number of clinical
trials in Britain.”
Galsworthy, however, disagrees
with the notion that EU bureaucracy
is stifling progress in science.
“I can actually think of more UK
government science policy aspects
that need reforming than European
Commission ones! The relationship
between UK scientists and the
Commission is very good. When
Junker booted out the position of the
Chief Scientific Adviser (a Brit, Anne
Glover) with little warning, there
was outcry from our community.
Negotiations were had and we now
have a seven-member scientific
advisory panel that actually looks like
a much more sensible structure.”
This is an extremely complex
debate that requires an informed,
detailed understanding of a huge
range of issues. The effect of a ‘Brexit’
would extend far beyond people’s
most common gripe, immigration,
through to areas including healthcare,
foreign affairs and education.
Science will not be the most
important topic in the referendum
campaign. But the importance of
large-scale, international research
is much greater than many people
realise, enhancing medicine and
the energy industry, on top of the
economic benefits that trickle down
from academia.
Could we still lead the world with
well funded and effective research
from outside the EU?
