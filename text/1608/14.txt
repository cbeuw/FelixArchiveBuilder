announcement that they would
start implementing a system where
creators of mods for Elder Scrolls:
Skyrim would be able to start charging
for their products. The mod makers
will start making money once their
mod makes more than $100 and only
actually make 25% of the profits with
the rest going to Valve and Bethesda.
While this amount seems quite
measly, this percentage was set by
the publisher of the game, and could
have varied with different games. I
say, “could have” here, because the
moment this news broke, an uproar
of gargantuan proportions permeated
the gaming community, including
one of the biggest Reddit circle-jerks
this writer has ever seen. As a result
of this backlash, Valve swiftly decided
to recall the proposed system (among
statements by Bethesda who said they
still supported the motion) and mods
were free once more.
Within the space of 3-4 days, all that
we knew and hoped about the modding
community had been tarnished, and
a new apocalyptic world of where you
would have to pay for that awesome
new quest or community-made nudity
mode was starting to appear. A month
later, and the grass has grown over
the matter, but the innocence that the
gaming community once regarded
mods with has been blemished.
But why are mods so great, you say?
Well, in our day and age of greedy
game studios, who are aiming to suck
as much money out of you as possible
by making you pay for parts of the
games in the form of DLC or leaving
awesome parts out just because you
The Financial Future of Mods
About a month ago, the news
broke that Valve, along with
Bethesda, was going to start
charging for mods for the best-seller
Skyrim. I had originally meant to write
an article then, but was so engrossed
in the death throes that were my
exams, that I was unable to form a
coherent thought that was not study
related. However now exams are over,
and all my fears, hopes and thoughts
have surfaced yet again, so I thought
it might be a good time to put them
down on paper.
Quick heads-up: A mod (or
modification) of a game, is a user
made/community made modification
to a game. They range all the way from
slight updates, like having new skins
or better graphics all the way to full
rewrites like new missions, characters
and areas. They allow for a game to be
extended beyond the scope of what the
developers originally intended and are
the last good bastion of this horrible
world of Downloadable Content
(DLC), preorder bonuses and console-
exclusives. A good rule of thumb is;
the better the modding community
for your game, the longer shelf-life it
will have.
If you don’t know what the hell I
am talking about here is a little recap.
On the 26th
April, Valve put out an
didn’t preorder, it is really refreshing
to be able to change your game in a
meaningful way and get new content
without having to empty your wallet.
Also, it allows you to have several
different gaming experiences, from
the weird and wacky to the most
serious, all in the same game. A great
example of this is Skyrim. This is a
game that was released in 2011 (yes,
you feel very old now, as do I), but is
still being played by a huge number
of people. This is direct result of the
myriad of different mods that have
kept this game alive and thriving.
So we have set the scene, now to
the actual discussion, what are the
pros and cons of a paid mod system?
Let’s start with the pro first (please
hear me out there are some pros!).
Well basically, all those mod-makers,
who currently need a day job to pay
the bills, would be able to turn their
hobbies into their day jobs! This means
that if they could make money of
their creations, they could potentially
focus their entire time on the making
of mods, coming out with more
regularity, quality and creativity.
On the other hand the only real
con seems to be that it won’t be free
anymore, and that we gamers now
have to pay for stuff that we used to
get for nothing! I mean, there were
several cons associated with the way
Steam had set up the system, including
things such as copyright issues, quality
control and the share that the modders
would get, among many others. But
in its purest form and implemented
correctly, the only thing that gamers
can find as a negative is that we don’t
"I think
paying for
mods is
probably
the way
the future
is going to
be..."
"The
better the
modding
community
for your
game, the
longer
shelf-life it
will have."
want to be forced to pay for something
if we haven’t done so in the past.
I currently very much enjoy the
model that we employ, and it has
definitely made the gaming industry
acknowledge that a good modding
community is what makes your game
sell those extra couple million copies.
However, with current copyright laws
no modder can make money off their
mods without being sued to death by
the studios. Therefore the only way
this paid thing is going to work is
either, the studios become slightly less
greedy, or they and the mod-maker
come to an agreement that allows
them to split the profits (hopefully
more fairly next time). If you give it
more thought, having paid mods may
actually allow these features to be
implemented fully in a game (and/or
future iterations of the game), because
the studio can see directly what is
popular with the user base and act
upon that information.
In my personal opinion, while I
don’t like it but I can see is necessary, I
think paying for mods is probably the
way the future is going to be, as long
as the prices and quality of the goods
offered are reasonable. It is the only
real sustainable way to keep talent
and creativity in the gaming industry
without them having to form their
own indie studios (whose games we
would then have to pay for anyway).
Sometimes, we as gamers have to not
do what is easy or cheaper, but what is
right, and in this case I think showing
appreciation to those guys who have
given us so much joy and fun is the
right thing to do.
