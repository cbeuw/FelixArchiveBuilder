Sometimes,as Arts Editor,the
stars align,and fate drops some
serendipity in your lap.Those
who have been reading this
section for a while will know
that we try to theme each issue;
sometimes this is easy (several
exhibitions about textiles,plus a
comment piece on fashion,can
easily come under the heading
‘style’),and sometimes it is
hard (you try to link together
a Wagner opera,a Javanese
puppet show,and an exhibition
of Constructivist art).However,
this week’s issue is simple: a
show of Japanese artists,and a
piece of Japanese theatre,based
on a work by East Asia’s best
known author–therefore,The
Japan Issue makes perfect sense.
Bish,bash,bosh.
We start off with a preview
of TwoTruths,a show that
displays the best artistic talents
of Japan,whether they are
based in London or elsewhere.
Taking its name from the
Buddhist principle that there
are two different levels of
truth,the Griffin Gallery show
explores the impact traditional
Japanese culture can have on
contemporary art.Elizaveta
Tchebaniouk is impressed by
what’s on offer,calling it a
“juxtaposition of traditional
culture and contemporary
modernism”.
We then move on to the
Barbican,who play host to
the Ninagawa Company’s
adaptation of the much-
loved novel Kafkaonthe
Shore.The company,headed
by legendary director Yukio
Ninagawa,manages to handle
the complexity of Haruki
Murakami’s source material
with delicacy and tact,creating a
marvellously sensual production
that bewitches the audience.
Over the past week,I keep
coming back to the Yoko Ono
quote above; as her long-
overdue retrospective opens at
the Museom of Modern Arts,and
her work is rediscovered,I feel
we can all learn from Ono.One
cannot simply dabble in culture;
one must dive straight in,and
breathe in.
In the Western world it is
believed that truth is singular; all
other versions of truth are lies.
However, a key Buddhist doctrine,
and the basis of the title of this
exhibition, states that there are two
levels of truth – conventional and
ultimate. This is a key concept to
meditate upon and have in mind as
you view this exhibition of the works
of six Japanese artists (three of whom
are established and London-based,
while the others are recent graduates
and based in Japan).
What is surprising in Two Truths is
that the works of both the established
Japanese born but London-based
artists, and the artists still living and
working in Japan reflect a similar
concept of ‘truth’. The purpose and
vision of each artist is unique, and
is conveyed through a most diverse
array of media and subject matter.
However, there is a profound link
– almost a common energy – that
unifies the works as one exhibition.
At first glance, the works appear
simply modern and contemporary.
However, behind each work is a
meaningful message and purpose
of the artist. Each work reinterprets
the world in a modern and
unconventional way, while a deep
sense of tradition lends a subtle, but
nonetheless influential echo of the
past.
For example, for her work Secret
Garland, ICHASU reinvents two
traditional Japanese screens through
the process of painting them with
bright manga-inspired imagery. An
initially unnoticed contrast in this
piece is that the back is left unpainted,
and bears remnants of old untouched
writing. Keisuke Katsuki makes
his Pixel Painting pieces through a
methodical process which is almost
a modern meditative practice,
reflecting the patience and rhythm of
traditional ceremonies; his works are
paintings of the pixels which are seen
when zooming into a digital image of
a painting. Yuka Kurita works echo
the tradition of sushi – they show
packed salmon slices painted in an
unfamiliar and unrealistic way.
The direct and indirect aspects of
Japanese traditions that also echo
in the contemporary works of the
London based artists is even more
surprising. For example, Miho Sato
used old photographs of Japanese
children as subject for her paintings
School Ground and School Ground
2. The works of Yukako Shibata
are abstract, but philosophical and
meditative in their exploration of
a paradox, reflecting neon colors
against white. The Reciprocal trio
of works by Kazuya Tsuji is also
highly meditative in the way the
colour tissue sways with any slight
breeze of movement through the
gallery; these works, in addition to
his other featured works which are
reinventions of found pieces, give
new forms and a fresh dimension to
old familiar materials.
Two Truths demonstrates the
juxtapositions of traditional culture
and contemporary modernism, of
what is present and what is actually
perceived, as well as exploring the
influence of cultural displacement
on the artist’s ‘truth’. The exhibition
itself is a metaphysical projection of
that Buddhist concept conveyed in
each shown artwork – the idea of two
omnipresent dualities working not
in opposition, but in unison, in an
attempt to discover true meaning and
purpose.
Two Truths is on at the Griffin
Gallery, W11, until 11th
July. Admittance
free.
