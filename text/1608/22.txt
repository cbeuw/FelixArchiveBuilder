Let’s talk about sex...ual health
“Never Have I Ever”: The sexual
adventures of Imperial students
The perennially popular
drinking game gets easier with
the arrival of the sex survey. If
you’re looking for an easy way to get
people to drink, look no further than
the old classics: fuck buddies, and one
night stands.
53% of students have had a one
night stand, with the males proving
more likely to love ‘em and leave
‘em (or at least claim they had). 55%
of males said they’d had a one night
stand, while 50% of females said the
same.
Fuck buddies (or ‘friends with
benefits’, for those of you who
prefer your no strings attached
sex to come with a dash of the ol’
coyness) are almost as popular, with
44% admitting they’d been in an
arrangement. It’s an exactly equal
divide across the genders, with the
same percentage of males and females
‘fessing up to getting all of the fun
with none of the consequences. You
sex-loving commitment-phobes, you.
There’s also plenty on just how
people wanted their sex to play out,
with students giving opinions on
a veritable smorgasbord of sexual
acts. Oral sex ranked at the top of
everyone’s list of favourite acts,
with 70% liking giving it (and 11%
wanting to try giving), and 77% liking
receiving (and another 10% wanting
to try that). Pretty much all of you
like oral sex, it seems, so bear that
one in mind next time you indulge
in pleasures of the flesh. Felix: giving
you sex tips since whenever we started
doing this survey.
Nothing else quite matched up:
55% liked receiving hand jobs (but
only 40% liked giving them, so
someone’s going to be disappointed).
38% liked being fingered, but only
18% liked doing the fingering (pull
your finger out and get over yourself,
it’s what the lady likes). Anal sex
proved even less popular: 25% liked
giving (and another 21% want to
try), but only 12% like receiving it.
Lot of discrepancies in this giving/
receiving business. Sex: it’s all about
compromise.
It’s also about more than the
usual, for some of you at least. 11%
of students enjoy a good threesome,
while 5% like going one step further
into a full-blown orgy. 44% want to
try a threesome, while 23% want to
try an orgy. We’d suggest you all just
hook up, but the survey’s anonymous.
We have no idea who you are.
Beyond that, 28% like using
restraints in sex, while 30% like
using sex toys. Role play is approved
of by 18%, while sexting makes an
appearance with a 46% like-rate.
Sending explicit images is liked by
32%. Meaning two-thirds of you don’t
like dick pics. Stop. Stop the dick pics.
As to where that sex, regardless
of the relationship status of the
participants, might be happening,
turns out several students have been
getting busy on campus (halls not
included). 16% said they’d had sex
somewhere on an Imperial campus,
including Silwood Park, with 7% of
those who’d done the dirty on campus
doing said dirty there.
15% of campus sexy-times
happened in SAF (medics!), and yet
none happened in the Reynolds
Building over at Charing Cross
Hospital (try harder, medics). 23%
of campus sexers threw down in
Beit Quad, while 28% got it on in
the Union Offices. It’s an open-plan
office, guys. You’re disgusting. Not as
disgusting as the 1% who indulged in
carnal embrace in Eastside Bar, but
still pretty disgusting.
Ranking at the other end of the
scale, 1% claimed to have done
it in the underground tunnels (a
question which has spurred a host of
wannabes, clamouring to copulate
below the surface). No-one (claimed
to have) sexed it up in the Ethos
pool (thank God), or in the Bessemer
building. The prize for biggest
disappointment goes to the Bone
building, which despite having an
obvious innuendo for a name hosted
precisely zero fun-loving couples. To
all Imperial students: please bone in
the Bone building. Then tell Felix. It’s
important. Do it for science.

SURVEY ANALYST
This year 65% of sexually active
students admitted to having
had unprotected sex in the past.
31% of you have apparently been
well behaved, while the remaining
4% chose not to say whether they had
done it or not.
Remember you can pick up
condoms for free at a number of
places on campus, including the
Student Activities Centre on Floor
2M of the Union Building in Beit
(which also hands out dental dams
and pregnancy tests) and Imperial
College Health Centre.
Also don’t forget that at least once
a term Imperial College Union runs
sexual health clinics in conjunction
with the Terrence Higgins Trust,
where you can get advice and free STI
tests.
Speaking of STIs, a whopping 88%
of you claim to have never had an STI.
3% think it’s possible they’ve had one
but aren’t sure, 4% did not wish to
say, and just 5% said they have had an
STI at some point in the past.
Perhaps the apparent low rate of
STIs is down to us simply not getting
tested often enough – 45% of the
sexually active students say they’ve
never had an STI test.
For 13% of you, your last test was
more than 12 months ago; 31% of you
have been tested in the last year and
5% as recently as the last month. This
time 6% of you did not wish to say
when you were last tested.
We also asked you all where you’re
getting sex and masturbation tips
from. The biggest information source
this year was the internet, with 61% of
you getting tips “online”.
49% of respondents say they take
advice from their partner and 37%
from friends. Porn was the next
biggest category, with 29% of you
admitting to sourcing your ideas
from the stuff.
Just 11% of students get sex tips
from books (maybe we should’ve
asked you about 50 Shades Of Gray
separately), 9% from movies and
magazines and 2% from “other
sources”.
14% of you apparently “still don’t
know anything lol”. Maybe you can
get some tips from the sex survey?
We gave you a chance to tell us
what those “other sources” were
in a text box. Most of you just said
“experimentation” or “my own
imagination”, and at least one
claimed to have “learnt on the job”.
Two of you said you’re getting sex
tips from “your mum” – very original
guys – and one claims to get them
from “the Rector”.
So whatever you’re doing and
wherever you’re getting the idea
from, do us a favour and get tested
once in a while, yeah?
