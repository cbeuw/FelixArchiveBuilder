to help spinal injuries
Aleading fitness equipment
company has agreed a deal
with Imperial College London
to design and kit-out a new state of
the art gym in the new Woodward
halls in Acton. Pulse Fitness, who
have also created gyms at 500 further
and higher education institutions
in the country, including King’s
College London, London South Bank
University, and Goldsmiths, aim to
start the project in June 2015. The
gym is estimated to take ten weeks to
complete and is timed to open before
the first year of students take up
residence in the first week of October.
The gym will be run by Pulse
themselves for the next ten years as a
branch of its Club Pulse division, with
continued support from stakeholders
at Imperial. The gym will be a two-
storey state of the art fitness facility
with as many as 85 machines. It will
also include a multifunctional studio
space. Each piece of cardio equipment
at the gym will be equipped with a
Cirrus Console, an 18.5 inch android
tablet with touch screen that will
allow users to personalise their
workouts, while watching digital
television or browsing the internet.
In addition to the Cirrus Console,
Pulse will also be including
SmartCentre, an interactive
technology that provides motivation
and stores personalised gym
workouts. It also gives user feedback
and aids retention by connecting
members with equipment, staff, and
management.
Warren Ormerod, who is Director
of Club Operations at Pulse, said of
the deal “This is a landmark contract
for Pulse and a testament to our
first rate services, equipment and
previous operational work within the
education sector. As a UK company
we’re excited to be working with
one of the top ranked universities
in the UK and indeed the world, and
will strive to create a facility which
reflects these high wstandards. With
extensive experience operating dual
use facilities in higher education
institutions, as well as providing
equipment and delivering design and
build services, we really understand
what works for private members
and students alike. We are confident
we’ll not only meet but exceed the
objectives and targets set in terms of
usage, retention and revenue.”
The gym will be open to private
members and staff, and will be
available for students to use free of
charge.
Researchers from the Imperial
College Department of
Medicine have discovered that
a group of drugs used to treat cancer
could also have an effect on treating
spinal cord injuries.
Led by Professor Simone di
Giovanni, the team conducted a study
where they treated a group of mice
with cancer drugs called nutlins. They
discovered that the mice that received
said treatment recovered far more
movement than those left untreated.
At present, there are no methods of
treatment that are effective on spinal
cord injuries, which cause various
degrees of paralysis in patients
depending on the location of the
injury, with patients typically ending
up being confined to wheelchairs. Due
to the fact that stimulating regrowth
in damaged spinal cord nerves is
extremely difficult, these injuries are
permanent.
The study in adult mice utilized
drugs that were meant to halt the
growth of cancerous tumours, but
said drugs had the side effect of
preventing a particular series of
proteins from interacting to restrict
nerve growth. In some mice with
partially severed spinal cords, the
researchers were able to stimulate
nerve regrowth, meaning 75% of
the test subjects went from being
paralyzed to being able to scale a
ladder. Mice not treated with the
drugs only made a slight recovery in
their mobility.
Prof di Giovanni however
emphasised the need for further
testing, saying that although the
results shown by the mice were
“very encouraging”, rats have more
similarities in their spinal cord
structures with that of humans,
so studies with the latter would be
required first. The research team
believes that human clinical trials
could take place within ten years.

will be
