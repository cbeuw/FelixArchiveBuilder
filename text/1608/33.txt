CANCER
VIRGO
This week, you decide that
enough is enough and you
don’t want Felix printing any
more jokes about you that
make you sound like someone
who wants to have sex with
goats.
Unfortunately, you are a
fresher so no one cares when
you complain.
HOROSCOPES
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
CAPRICORN
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week, you start a fight
in the Union. Fortunately,
it’s with the guy who wrote
last week’s shit horoscopes
so the crowd is behind you.
Unfortunately, you can’t
remember whether you won
or not.
This week, you decide to help
analyse the sex survey results.
The sheer number of strange
places people have wanked on
campus shocks you, until you
remember that awkward patch
you had in second year.
At least you never resorted to
the Faculty Building.
This week, you are a devoted
reader of the horoscopes. Once
again, you find the highlight of
your week has been ruined by
Hangman.
Convinced you can do better
than this shit, you email your
own horoscopes to hangman@
imperial.ac.uk demanding they
be printed in the next issue.
This week, you are the Felix
editor. The sex survey results
are driving you insane, and
you spend 48 hours making
infographics.
Unfortunately all you have
done is draw a giant penis on
your screen over and over
again.
This week, you are Benedict
Cumberbatch. Relaxing on a
rare day off, you find yourself
perusing an issue of Felix. You
notice a small box containing
a picture of your face in the
Puzzles section. Confused, you
look through other issues, only
to find more boxes with your
face in. You worry about the
people making this paper.
This week, you finish your
exams, and get royally
plastered to celebrate. You
wake up the morning after,
face-down on the floor of the
Felix office.
After a moment of confused
recollection, you pick yourself
up, dust yourself off, and go to
work in the Union Offices.
This week, you anxiously
await the publication of the
sex survey. It’s your final
year, and you’ve managed
the impossible: you’ve had
sex in every possible place on
campus. You can’t wait to see
the reponse.
Felix thinks you’re a troll and
ignores your data. You cry.
This week, you decide to take a
break from revision and go to
Starbucks.
There’s not a punchline to
this one, I just really want to go
to Starbucks right now.
This week, you finally notice
that ‘Virgo’ looks a bit like
‘Virgin’. You giggle to yourself
in the corner. Everyone thinks
you’re a bit weird.
This week, you are Hangman.
Your horoscopes writer is too
busy to do the horoscopes this
week, but they don’t tell you
until a few hours before your
print deadline.
Enraged, drunk, and mildly
fuming, you have to write
them all yourself.
This week, you are an
anonymous ex-President of a
global football organisation.
After being forced to step
down following most of your
employees being arrested, you
sit at home catching up on the
news.
You see that Felix has printed
a picture of you with a mean
caption. You cry.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 1/4
Sunday 30th May
Well, diary, the good news is that the exams are over.
The bad news is that I didn’t go to any of them, and I think that in at least one of the ones I went to I just
wrote the words Kris Kraye over and over. I can’t really remember, it’s all a bit of a fog.
Monday 1st June
I’m worried that I might have messed my degree up, and that I’ll drop out and have to start again at a university
somewhere shit where there are more Greggs’ than Range Rovers. I tried to find Kris Kraye because I thought
that as DPW he might be able to help me, but it was his birthday and I saw him in the bar with the Dorothies
getting shots and grinding in Metric. Fuck my life.
Tuesday 2rd June
My parents phoned to ask about how the exams went. I told them that I had norovirus and couldn’t do them. Yeah,
norovirus. I don’t know if the college will believe me though.
Wednesday 3rd June
I did the Felix sex survey. I felt that I had to embellish a bit, so I told them that I had a wank in triple-E. It was
actually Skempton, but you know, got to have a bit of glamour.
Thursday 4th June
I overheard the Felix editor in the bar telling people that someone had said that they had a threesome involving a
goat in the sex survey. Damn you Kris Kraye, why must you shit all over my dreams.
