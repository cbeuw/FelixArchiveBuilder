Madeline and Vin present a guide
to the terminology of sexual and
gender identity
Concepts at a glance:
Gender and Sexuality
When discussing gender,
sexuality, and similar
topics, there are a lot of
terms and concepts that you might
come across. This article will provide
a brief introduction to these concepts,
what they mean, and how to use
the words correctly. Let’s start with
concepts.
Sexuality
This is an intrinsic part of who we
are. Sexuality is very complicated;
generally it is considered to be binary,
but it is actually infinitely more
complex. The next-most-simplified
model is a spectrum, but this is also
a simplification, as sexuality is more
like the combination of several
independent spectra. In this article we
will focus on two components.
The most obvious component of
sexuality is the one that expresses
which gender or genders you
are attracted to; heterosexual
(traditionally meaning “attracted to
the opposite gender [from oneself]”,
though as we’ll explore later the
concept of “the opposite gender”
is not as well-defined as you might
think) and homosexual (attracted to
the same gender) are not the only two
orientations or identities.
As you may know, there are many
more, including but not limited to
bisexual (attracted to both men and
women), pansexual (attracted to all
genders), polysexual (attracted to
lots of different genders) and asexual
(attracted to no genders; doesn’t
experience sexual attraction at all –
see below).
The other biggest part of sexuality
is the one that expresses the level of
attraction, and how you are attracted
to someone. This can be defined by
how frequently you feel sexually
attracted to someone. It’s not the
same thing as your sex drive; this
is about how frequently there is a
person you find attractive, rather
than how often you want to engage in
sexual activity with a given person.
This includes people who
experience ‘normal’ or average levels
of sexual attraction to others, often
termed verisexual, allosexual or
just plain sexual (there’s not yet a
consensus on the appropriate term),
demisexuals (who only experience
sexual attraction to people with
whom they already have a close bond),
and asexuals (who do not experience
sexual attraction at all).
Romantic attraction
These same components can also
apply to romantic attraction. This
is frequently explained as desire
for all the loving, couple-y parts
of a relationship, just without the
actual sex. All the elements of sexual
orientation have corresponding, but
independent romantic components.
While it is most common for
a person’s romantic and sexual
orientations to align, it is entirely
possible for them to differ – one
common manifestation of this is
to be either asexual or aromantic,
but there is no reason one couldn’t
be, for example, heterosexual and
homoromantic (though it would
probably suck).
Gender
Gender is a nebulous concept which
society tends to push as a binary
of masculine and feminine, and
associated with your sex. However,
gender is, to bastardise a quote from
the Doctor, more like a great big ball
of wibbly-wobbly gendery-bendery...
stuff. Gender is expressed in many
ways, including hair, clothing and
make-up. Gender identity and the
gender you are assigned at birth
according to your body’s sex do not
necessarily match up.
You may be cisgender (you identify
with the gender that your body
indicates to society), transgender
(you identify with a gender other
than the one you were assigned at
birth), agender (where, similarly
to asexuality or aromanticism,
gender is a concept to which you
feel ambivalence), or any shade
inbetween (androgyny is one popular
term for the exact middle-ground of
the male-female gender spectrum).
This is entirely separate from being
‘transexual’ or ‘transgender’ (related
but distinct terms; the latter is the
more-usually applicable).
‘Transgender’ (always an adjective;
please do not use ‘transgender’ as a
noun) refers to the situation where
the sex and/or gender a person was
assigned when they were born doesn’t
match their identity. A related term
with rather narrower applicability
is ‘transexual’ (and while that word
has a history as a noun, that history
means you should probably avoid
using it that way too unless you know
exactly what you’re doing), and both
are commonly abbreviated to ‘trans’.
These things get more complicated
when you consider that intersex
people exist. Being “intersex” means
their body and reproductive systems
do not entirely match either the male
or female systems. Up to 1.7% of
babies exhibit some degree of sexual
ambiguity at birth, and as they grow
up these people may end up having
any of the above gender identities.
Fluidity
While all these labels are great, if
"Generally
it is
considered
to be
binary, but
[sexuality]
is actually
infinitely
more
complex"
"Gender is
a nebulous
concept
which
society
tends to
push as a
binary of
masculine
and
feminine"
