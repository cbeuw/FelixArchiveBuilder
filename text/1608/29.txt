Kafka, but not as you know him
The work of Japanese author
Haruki Murakami could
perhaps best be described as
“dense”. Possibly Japan’s greatest
living novelist – or at least, the best
known internationally – Murakami’s
feather-light, delicate prose belies the
complex themes that lie at the core of
his novels. Their plots are like riddles,
which, without solutions, are cast
adrift on a sea of surreality. As such,
it takes a brave director to tackle his
work, especially since he has said he
won’t watch adaptations of his work;
there are few better qualified to tackle
this, therefore, than Japanese director
Yukio Ninagawa who, as he stands
on the cusp of his ninth decade of
life, brings his accomplished version
of Kafka on the Shore to London’s
Barbican Centre.
The plot of Kafka on the Shore is
one of time and memory, of loss
and longing, of providence and
serendipity. On the one hand we have
Kafka Tamura, a teen runaway who
makes it to a private library managed
by the mysterious Miss Saeki, only
for his literary idyll to be destroyed
by the news of his father’s murder;
on the other is Satoru Nakata, an eel-
loving elderly man, who was knocked
unconscious in a mysterious accident,
and awoke without his memory but
with the ability to talk to cats. As
their stories begin to weave together,
the nature of reality begins to
unwind, as the audience are left with
more questions than answers.
With such a convoluted plot, a
sceptical approach to the play is to
be understood. However, Ninagawa
manages to tread a course through
the text with ease: his version of Kafka
on the Shore retains the mystery and
intrigue of the original book, but still
manages to come in at just under
three hours long, a remarkable feat
considering the chunky nature of the
source material.
The staging of the play retains the
sensuality of the source material.
Kafka on the Shore is a book of soft
edges, of glimmering light, and this
effect is recreated through Tsukasa
Nakagoshi’s set design, which sees the
cast and props swirl around the stage
in a number of gigantic cubes. The
effect is like that of a living museum,
the action of the play contained
within a series of beautiful vitrines.
Of course, this could not be achieved
without the superhuman efforts of
the crew, who drag and shove these
cubes into their respective position;
at the end of the play they appear,
dressed all in black, to a rapturous
round of applause from the audience.
The lighting design, courtesy of
Motoi Hattori, who has worked with
Ninagawa on numerous occasions,
is also superb, transporting us from
the bright lights of a neon-charged
Tokyo, through into the tranquil
confines of Takamatsu, and finally
to a mystical second-world, one of
undead WWII soldiers, unrequited
loves, and rain that comes down like
mist. The overall effect is to transport
us a million miles away from the
70s-brown interior of the Barbican
Hall, into a land of dreams and
beauty.
The cast, which includes a number
of regular Ninagawa collaborators, is
more than prepared for the gauntlet
thrown down by Murakami. In
particular, Katsumi Kiba’s Nakata
is excellent, with Kiba adding a
completely believable childishness to
his character; despite Nakata’s bizarre
oddities and his predilection for his
less-than-charming habit of referring
to himself in the third person, Kiba
makes sure that he is irresistibly
likable, and we have no choice but
to enjoy his presence. Similarly,
Rie Miyazawa – who appeared in
the 2004 film Tony Takitani, based
on Murakami’s short story – is
exceptional as Miss Saeki, a character
whose brittleness is only rivalled

Fred Fyles is enchanted by Ninagawa Company’s newest play
"The
staging of
the play
retains
all the
sensuality
of the
novel"
"Ninagawa
manages to
bring the
prose to
life, lifting
it off the
page"
by her sadness; Miyazawa imbues
her character with a sense of innate
melancholy, reflecting her tragic past.
In contrast, Nino Furuhata’s Kafka
seems to somewhat lack confidence –
it is no surprise to see that this is his
first acting credit.
If Ninagawa had merely attempted
to bring Murakami’s work to the
stage, that would have been enough.
But instead, he manages to bring
the Japanese author’s prose to life,
seemingly lifting words straight off
the page and, breathing energy into
them, letting them loose on the stage.
The fantastical characters of Kafka on
the Shore, thanks to the superb efforts
of the stage crew, step out onto the
stage, landing on firm feet – helped
of course by the superb staging and
lighting. With its heavy themes
of reality and artifice, its knowing
name-dropping of Yeats and Hegel,
and its powerful statement about the
modern world, Kafka should sink like
a stone. Instead, thanks to Ninagawa’s
masterful direction, it soars above the
audience, as delicate and beautiful as
a soap bubble.
The Ninagawa Company’s Kafka on
the Shore was on at the Barbican Centre
from 28th
- 30th
May. Performance was in
Japanese with English subtitles.
