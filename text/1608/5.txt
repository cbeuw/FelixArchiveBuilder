Universities and science minister
Jo Johnson speaks about migration
In his first speech as Minister
for Universities and Science,
Jo Johnson stated that the
government has “an ambition to
grow” its activity in international
education. Highlighting the economic
and social value of international
students, he affirmed his
commitment to addressing the drop
in numbers of students coming to the
UK from India.
Mr Johnson also spoke of his
concern that the UK “does not
welcome students as warmly as we
once did” and promised to “engage
and explain”, making clear that he
does not intend to introduce a cap
on the number of students who can
travel to the UK to study.
Speaking at the Going Global
conference for international
education, hosted by the British
Council this week in London, Mr
Johnson cited the contribution of
international students to the UK’s
research output and the £3.9 billion
in tuition fees they provide annually
as significant benefits to the UK.
“The UK of course values
international students who come
to this country,” said Mr Johnson.
“We recognise that competition
for the brightest and best students
from other countries is intensifying.
We will continue to ensure that our
excellent education system remains a
magnet for brilliant minds”.
However, his comments came with
a warning that this warm welcome
applied only to “genuine students”,
in line with the Conservative party
manifesto which pledges to “reform
the student visa system with new
measures to tackle abuse”.
Mr Johnson also announced that
the international education sector’s
careers advice organisation Graduate
Prospects has been enlisted by the
government to “help us expose
unscrupulous organisations and
Mr Johnson affirmed his commitment to addressing the drop in students coming from India.

students
Despite Mr Johnson’s
enthusiasm for the international
education sector,“more than
19,700”international students
were barred from or asked to
leave the UK in the last year.
The government has been
investigating alleged
fraud involving language
qualifications.Around 900 of
the students who are being
held in a detention centre are
being served with notice of their
removal from the country.
Overseas recruitment was
suspended at three Universities
and 84 private colleges last
year,resulting in an increase
in the number of Home
Office decisions to refuse visa
applications.
While the Universities have
now been permitted to begin
recruiting again,five of the
colleges have not yet regained
their visa sponsorship rights.
A number of students were
found to have cheated on their
English language qualifications,
with a total of 33,725 results
declared invalid and a further
22,694 judged as“questionable”.
Some of the students asked to
leave the UK will have been able
to remain after finding places
at other colleges that still held
licenses to organise their visas.
However,the National Union
of Students (NUS) believed this
number to be small.
NUS International Students’
Officer Shreya Paudel stated
that there was“little evidence”to
support the action against many
of the affected students.
“These statistics expose a
shocking example of the
government scapegoating
international students”.

Reducing migration into the UK is
one of the Conservative party’s main
ambitions. The current goal is to slash
the net annual number of migrants to
the tens of thousands, though this has
been reclassified as an “ambition” as
opposed to a target.
Universities in the UK have
previously expressed concerns about
the potential negative impacts of this
drive to reduce migration, warning
that the government attitude may
impact the number of international
students interested in studying in
the UK. There have been calls for
students to be removed from the net
migration figures.
Recognising the importance
of international students to the
future of the UK, Mr Johnson stated
“Today’s international students are
tomorrow’s world leaders. They take
friendships and loyalties home with
them that later become trade links,
cultural bonds and diplomatic ties”.
He also noted that students
from outside the European Union
“stimulate demand for courses
where domestic demand alone can
be insufficient to sustain them”, in
particular helping to “maintain our
first-class STEM provision”.
Mr Johnson mentioned that it
is a “personal aim” to overcome
misconceptions about the UK in
important countries such as India,
where numbers of international
students have fallen in recent
years. He concluded by reaffirming
that “across all our international
education activity, we have an
ambition to grow”.
