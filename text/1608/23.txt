The transgender community at Imperial:

The Felix Sex Survey found
that 9 of the respondents do
not identify with the gender
they were assigned at birth. A third
of those respondents said they were
unhappy with their sex life, and a few
commented about the issues they face
as transgender individuals.
Some cited difficulty in finding
partners, being in transition between
genders and generally struggling with
being assigned a different gender at
birth that they don’t identify with.
One respondent worryingly said that
they were suicidal, and said that they
hated the life they were living.
Said another respondent: “Since
splitting with my last partner, I’ve
come to think having any sort of sex
life is probably unrealistic until I’ve
had surgery.
“I can live with this, but the matter
of sex being so intertwined with
the broader topic of relationships,
means inevitably my situation is an
impediment to dating, which I think
bothers me more.”
Said another: “I hate being
transgender. My sex drive confuses
me. All I want is to live as a girl, have
breasts and a vagina and fall in love
with someone that I’m comfortable
being intimate with. I can’t though.
“I have to live as a boy and it hurts
every day. I try to tune out thoughts
related to falling in love because who
wants to be with a transgender girl
who doesn’t have a vagina or a female
voice?
“I hear stories of people falling in
love and being intimate with one
another. This just feels like something
I can never have.”
We decided to talk to some of the
members of Imperial’s wider LGBT+
community. Felix’s own Welfare
editor, Diba Esbati, spoke to two
students who shared their experiences
about being transgender or dating
those that identify as transgender too.
One student told us about the
transgender woman who they are
currently dating: “I am happily in
a relationship with a wonderful
woman. She is incredibly clever, has
gorgeous eyes and is possibly the most
amazing person I have ever met.”
They explained that their partner
may not decide to come out as
transgender or even transition
completely, but they are committed
to supporting her regardless. They
also explained that just like any other
relationship, communication is key.
“We must discuss and be aware of
each others’ boundaries, and adjust
our activities according to the various
levels of dysphoria my partner is
experiencing.
“My partner sometimes has a
complex response to her own arousal
or her body and while this definitely
changes the way our relationship
dynamic functions, it does not make
it inherently more difficult.
“It simply requires an increased
level of awareness of how comfortable
my partner is with any one thing we
are doing together.”
They added: “And another, final
thing that I feel is important; while
my partner is not out, she is still very
much a woman to me. She is beautiful
and kind.
“When she is feeling particularly
conflicted or experiencing very bad
dysphoria all I can do is try and love
her through it and help prevent her
and myself from breaking because of
the pain.”
Skye, an Imperial student who
is openly transgender, spoke to
Felix about how difficult it can be
to identify as such, but how others
should embrace their uniqueness: “No
two people are identical and people
being different to each other makes
humanity as a larger entity all the
better for it.
“So don’t hate yourself for being
transgender. Be happy that you found
something that helps to define who
you are, thus you know yourself
better and are stronger for having
found that aspect of yourself.
“It isn’t a life-ender and there are
ways to help you become who you
view yourself to be, and who you want
to be.”
Skye advised that anyone struggling
should seek advice as soon as
possible, either from the Imperial
counselling service in the short term,
and potentially visiting a dedicated
specialist at a Gender Identity Clinic
(GIC) in the long term.
Skye concluded: “There is no real
reason why anyone can’t have love
and meet the right person at some
point in their life, regardless of who
they are or what gender they identify
as.”
Both students we spoke to had
comments for those who responded
to the sex survey, and both stressed
that those out there are not alone.
The anonymous student who
is dating a transgender woman
explained the importance of
supporting those who may be
struggling to come to terms with
their gender identity: “Acceptance,
communication and reassurance of
their validity cannot be given too
much.
“Your support – even in something
as little as remembering to use their
preferred pronouns or as large as
standing by them as they decide
to come out –is invaluable and
appreciated.”
Said Skye: “Being trans is not
exactly a gift at first glance, but
matters are getting better – trans
visibility is so, so much better than it
has been even recently and there are
actual wonderful trans people making
their way into the public eye.
“Love and sex are hard. Really
hard. And yup, dysphoria makes
the practicality tricky at times. But
I promise that people exist who will
care about that in the right way.
I promise you that these people
exist, regardless of your personal
orientation with respect to partners.
“The voice and other parts are nice,
but you’re a girl, not a number on the
Prader scale. You can still have the
potential for love, just like anyone.
“You’re a wonderful human.”
For those who want to seek help or
guidance in relation to any of the above
issues, there are many support networks
you can access.
For example, the Beaumont Society
(01582412220) offers 24h support and
advice for transgender people and their
loved. Also, Mind OUT (lgbtmind.com)
has plenty of resources for all LGBT+
community who may be struggling with
mental health concerns.
