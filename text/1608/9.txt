Josh Emden investigates the results of Califronia’s 1.3GW energy storage target
California’s Bullseye
Unlike coal, oil and gas,
electricity is very easy to
transport but very difficult
to store. In most modern power
systems, most electricity actually
comes from coal or gas power stations
so this isn’t a problem. In other
words, you combine the storability of
coal and gas with the transportability
of electricity.
But what happens when you have to
stop using these fuels because of CO2
constraints and replace them with
renewables that generate electricity
intermittently, depending on whether
the sun is shining or the wind is
blowing? In steps energy storage.
At a fundamental level, energy
storage absorbs excess electricity
when there’s too much on the grid
and releases it when demand from
consumers outstrips supply. In
essence, it’s a very useful way to
‘firm up’ renewables and make them
behave more like power stations that
can produce electricity all the time.
As the world begins to wake up to
the need to decarbonise their power
systems, energy storage is beginning
to play an ever bigger role.
California Dreaming
One of the most important regions
that has started to recognise this value
is California. The State has proven
to be a hub of innovation for the
technology, with companies like Tesla
recently moving into the domestic
energy storage industry with their
shiny new Powerwall.
Largely though, this recognition
of energy storage is about
accommodating intermittent
renewables onto the grid, driven by a
‘Renewable Portfolio Standard’ that
requires 33% of electricity sales to
come from renewables by 2020.
As a result, in October 2013, the
State set utilities a target of installing
enough energy storage to provide
1.3GW of power by 2020, enough to
power 1 million homes.
Target Acquired
As we’ve already mentioned,
energy storage is incredibly useful
at making renewable generation
more reliable. At the same time,
some storage technologies like
battery storage have traditionally
been seen as too expensive. Indeed,
many organisations, including the
International Energy Agency (IEA),
have acknowledged that costs must
be reduced for these technologies to
become commercially attractive.
In 2013 however, the California
Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) challenged this position by
performing a series of cost-benefit
analyses finding that, ‘the majority of
cases returned benefit-to-cost ratios
of greater than one, and the majority
of cases returned breakeven capital
cost of energy storage’.
These evaluations were key in
leading to California’s target, with
wider implications that ‘energy
storage’ and ‘cost-effectiveness’
were now being mentioned in the
same breath beyond discussions in
academic circles.
So Far so Good?
Happier still, according to one
source from the California Energy
Commission, the target will almost
certainly be met on time. Indeed,
recent studies have shown that the
US energy storage industry was worth
around $2 billion last year, with much
of this coming from California.
Going even further, as part of the
1.3GW target, utility companies have
a series of mini-targets that require
them to procure a certain amount
of storage year. For example, one
utility, Southern California Edison
(SCE), was required to procure
50MW worth of storage for 2014.
However, when SCE began tendering
for projects, it received over 500
proposals and instead decided to
procure over 250MWworth of energy
storage.
Such examples are not uncommon,
with California’s Independent System
Operator (CAISO) reporting last
year that the number of proposals
for energy storage in fact amounted
to around 2.1GW, well above the
original target. While these projects
ultimately still have to be built,
and not all may be approved, the
indications from the market certainly
sounds overwhelmingly positive.
This is perhaps embodied most
recently by the boundless enthusiasm
and innovation shown by Tesla, who
recently revealed their new Lithium-
ion battery storage for domestic and
commercial properties. Combine this
with the construction of their new
‘Gigafactory’ – purpose-built to drive
down the cost of battery technology –
and the prospects for energy storage
look very good indeed.
Fortune Favours the Cheap
There are of course some small
caveats. For one thing, the term
energy storage is actually rather
broad, encompassing a range of
different technologies suitable to
different types of applications beyond
just accommodating renewables.
Necessarily, these different
technologies also have a range of
different costs associated with them.
Whilst this is not inherently a bad
thing, there is perhaps a risk that
those more innovative technologies
whose capital costs are higher (and
don’t have companies like Tesla
driving them downwards) will get
edged out of the market by a target
which demands cost-effectiveness.
An often cited example is that of
‘metal-air’ batteries that use a solid,
rather than aqueous, membrane to
offer a higher energy density. Though
the technology is more innovative,
it is commercially immature. A
target with a deadline for project
completion by 2024 simply may not
have the patience required to see if
such a technology could grow up.
More than an Experiment
With that said, the storage target in
California still seems to be a fairly
unqualified success. So much so in
fact, that a Texan utility, Oncor, has
recently been considering investing
a whopping $5.2 billion into 5GW
of energy storage. Whilst policy
enthusiasm in the UK might be more
sluggish, industry groups like the
Electricity Storage Network (ESN)
are now campaigning for a target of
2GW by 2020, based on California’s
experience.
The term ‘emerging’ market is
often used pejoratively to describe
interesting technologies that are
unlikely to reach any meaningful
level of commercialisation. For many
years, energy storage has been given
such a label. In light of California’s
sustained success, one might now say
it has well and truly emerged.
