Much has been said and writ-
ten about the cost of a decent
sandwich around campus,
in particular the over-priced
bread-based offerings in
the JCR. However, a few
moments’ research shows
that buying your lunch on the
walkway might not just be
damaging your pocket, but
your health as well.
Salt is a chemical that we
are all familiar with, and
there can’t be many people
at Imperial who aren’t aware
that it is composed of sodi-
um and chlorine, two rather
nasty elements.
If your sodium levels are too
high, your body retains too
much water, causing blood
pressure to rise and putting
strain on the heart. As the
CASH (Consensus Action
on Salt and Health) website
claims, “it is also widely rec-
ognised that a high salt diet
has other adverse effects,
such as osteoporosis, asth-
ma, and is closely linked to
cancer of the stomach. There
is also evidence that a high
salt intake in childhood may
predispose us to getting high
blood pressure later in life.
All in all, it seems that too
much salt isn’t good for you.
Government recommenda-
tions for daily intake tell us
that we should consume less
than 6g of salt per day.
The Institute of Medicine
suggests that “healthy 19- to
50-year-old adults should con-
sume 3.8 grams of salt a day,
to replace the amount lost
daily on average” and places
an upper limit “that people
should not exceed” at 5.8g.
However, it isn’t always
obvious exactly how much
salt a product contains, as
usually only the sodium level
is quoted on the packaging.
Fear not, Imperial students,
for a moment alone with a
periodic table reassures you
that to convert sodium weight
into salt weight you just have
to multiply by about 2.5.
Back in the JCR, I’m
munching on a fairly tasty
(but overpriced) lunchtime
meal of Café Life’s ‘Breakfast
Wrapped Up’, along with
a packet of salt and vin-
egar McCoy’s. Which one
has more salt? The crisps?
Wrong. A few scrawlings on
a piece of paper (calculators
are for wimps) reveals that
the sandwich contains 4.25g
of salt and the crisps 2.75g.
That’s a total of 7g of salt, and
so assuming I had a sensible
breakfast I’m well over my
daily allowance already. By
the way, 7g is roughly equiv-
alent to drinking 700ml of
Atlantic seawater. Tasty.
Is this surprising? Few peo-
ple would look at ‘Breakfast
Wrapped Up’ and assume
that this sausage, egg and
bacon wrap is healthy, but
most would put that down
to fat content. However, the
fact that this sandwich has
55% more salt than the crisps
shocked me.
This sandwich is by no
means the only one in the
JCR that might cause health
problems if you ate there
every day. Most sandwiches I
saw contained between 1 and
1.3 grams of sodium (or 2.5 to
4 grams of salt): around half
of your daily allowance, even
without the crisps.
In practice, it may be dif-
ficult to reduce the amount
of salt in your diet, simply
because there is so much of it
in processed food. According
to dietician Rosie Taylor, “it
can be difficult to ensure a
low salt diet. This is because
65-75% of the salt we con-
sume is from hidden sources
– processed foods or natu-
rally occuring in foods. Only
about 15% of the salt we eat
is added during cooking or at
the table.”
However, this is an issue
that the Government is taking
seriously. Taylor continues:
“The Government are now in
discussions with food manu-
facturers to decide ways of
reducing the salt content of
foods over time, so that this
target of 6g can be reached”
The levels of salt in some
JCR sandwiches are very
worrying, and there are
clearly health risks involved.
The least they could do is
lower the price – then we
could save up for the nursing
we might need in later life.

The importance of good nutri-
tion is nothing new. Back in
400BC, Hippocrates said:
“Let food be your medicine
and medicine be your food.”
As a population, our life-
styles and eating habits have
changed drastically over the
past couple of decades. The
environment we live in has
also changed, with the ever-
increasing availability of food
at all hours of the day, from
takeaways and home deliv-
eries to supermarket ready
meals, we have become a
population of fast food lov-
ers. And it’s impacting on our
health.
Links between diet and dis-
ease are better understood
than ever before, and there
is a large body of evidence
showing that what you eat
has an enormous impact on
your health. Today, at least
four of the ten leading causes
of death in the UK – heart
disease, cancer, stroke and
diabetes – are directly related
to the way we eat, and diet is
also implicated in scores of
other conditions. We mustn’t
underestimate the influence
on our health of how and what
we eat.
Yet, whilst awareness is
increasing about the role diet
can play in promoting good
health and reducing the risk
of certain diseases, it seems
that healthy intentions are
often hampered as a result of
the food available to people at
their places of work, or, in the
cases of students at Imperial,
their places of study.
As the Felix survey has
shown, there is demand for
healthy food at Imperial. So
are we being let down by
those who supply the food?
Do universities need a ‘school
dinners’ style visit from Jamie
Oliver to banish the chips and
bring in the salads?
I think not. There are
unhealthy foods available on
campus – take the salt-rid-
den meaty sandwich from the
JCR or the rows of chocolate
bars and sugar-laden drinks
in the walkway newsagent,
and of course you’ll end up
with a pretty dire lunch, lack-
ing in vitamins and fibre, and
riddled with sugar and fat.
On the other hand, buying a
couple of pieces of fresh fruit
and a bottle of water from
the JCR before taking a short
walk across Prince Consort
Road to buy a hot jacket pota-
to and baked beans would
give you an altogether differ-
ent kind of meal. As the man-
tra of my fellow dieticians
across the country goes, “no
foods should be banned from
a healthy diet, it’s about vari-
ety and moderation”.
So, I would like to argue
the case for – along with a
reduction in salt added to
processed foods by manufac-
turers – improved nutritional
labelling on foods: something
the Food Standards Agency
(FSA) are currently develop-
ing a ‘signposting’ system
for. I believe that the College
should continue to provide
a wide selection of foods, so
that the individual can make
their own informed choice
about the way they eat, but
perhaps they could do more
to highlight to us busy and
preoccupied students just
which options are the healthi-
est.
This problem will be par-
tially solved when the FSA’s
new signposting system
is launched. This will not,
however, apply to foods that
are freshly prepared and so
come unpackaged. It is here
that I think the university
could have a big impact on
informing its students about
healthy options. Who knows
what effect it could have
– improved exam results as
a consequence of improved
concentration, perhaps?
Food counts towards whether you pass or fail exams. Dietician
Rosie Taylor explains why you should care about what you eat
