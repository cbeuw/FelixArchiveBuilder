ALBUM REVIEWS
Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet guise
has slyly converted many guitar-
worshipping indie kids to his slinky
and beguiling mixture of folk and
electronica (I know, I am one), with
2003’s Rounds providing laid-back
jams, dancefloor-humping beats
and the nine-minute epic Unspoken
earning him seemingly endless criti-
cal acclaim.
Expectations are riding high on
this, his fourth album on Domino. In
the intervening years, Hebden has
professed an intense dislike for the
term ‘folktronica’ that was foisted
upon him by general critical opin-
ion, while producing his friend Dan
Snaith’s band, Manitoba (now known
as Caribou due to a ridiculous con-
flict with a punk singer, Handsome
Dick Manitoba). In short, anyone
expecting a straight-out repeat of
Rounds’ mostly acoustic fare will
be sorely disappointed. Hebden has
made it clear time and time again
that he falls in the class of art-
ists that believe only progression
is worthwhile – witness his earli-
er incarnation in the band Fridge,
formed at the tender age of fifteen,
who veered from Krautrock to post-
rock to you-name-it on their two
vastly unappreciated records.
The single, Smile Around The
Face, is constructed around a
Chipmunk-sounding soul vocal and
crashing live drums that clearly owe
a lot to his work with Caribou. Pretty
toy xylophones jump from speaker
to speaker, as the sample is cut
in/out against splashy cymbals and
tight snares. The cohesive moments
provide a hook that’s almost pop in
it’s simplicity and child-like glee.
And Then Patterns’ opening laid-
back and deceptively complex beat
harks back to the downtempo sound
of Rounds. A pretty piano figure
winds around phasing synth lines
and slowly draws you into the warm
soundscape of crackling sounds and
faraway-sounding vocal samples.
Hebden has professed a love for
last year’s MF Doom and Madlib
collaboration, Madvilliany, and
recently worked on an EP of remixes
due for release soon. Hearing them
brings it home how much Four Tet’s
snappy beats and cymbals owe to
hiphop production – High Fives has
a punchy, tense drum pattern that’s
vaguely reminiscent of Prefuse 73’s
instru-hop. Again, the sheer inven-
tiveness of the production is enough
to keep the listener’s attention,
rephrasing the warped xylophone
sounds of Rounds opener, Hands,
into a hummable melody.
The undisputed high point of this
album is Sun Drums And Soil. It
starts with Boards Of Canada-esque
synth washes and gentle bleeps,
before Hebden loses his restraint
and brings in a huge cymbal-break-
ing beat that’s straight out of the
Caribou rulebook. Jazz saxophones
loop and dance on the massive beat,
while warm rhodes piano builds an
ascending melody that’s almost sin-
ister. Nothing he’s ever done sounds
like this. It instantly calls to mind
Boom Bip, who tend to merge post-
rock’s love of severe volume chang-
es with downbeat electronica. Boom
Bip never had the utterly sublime
production that this record does,
each beat perfect, each component
of the mix melding seamlessly with
its neighbours.
Sleep, Eat Food, Have Visions is
interesting in that it spends three
minutes being a laidback bleep-fest,
while the remaining five minutes
– a hammering drill’n’bass – work
out with roughly a billion drum
sounds all crushed into one beat.
In that way, it’s akin to the opener,
Joy, which mauls listeners with its
huge, evil bassline. It’s almost as if
Hebden wants to refute the possible
coffee-tableness of Rounds.
This is probably the best IDM
record that’ll be released this year;
a thoughtful mix of charming melo-
dies, sophisticated production, and
sheer ingenuity. Stick it on repeat.

present alternatives to the big festivals (since they’ve all sold out, boo hoo)
