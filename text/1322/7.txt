Redeveloping your Union building
We hope that last week’s centre
page spread will have whetted
your appetites with the informa-
tion about the redevelopment of
the Union Building in Beit Quad,
despite the project still being in its
early stages.
As mentioned last week, your
views were first gathered during
the surveys and focus groups held
in the autumn term for the Strategic
Review. Then in the spring term the
tendering process for choosing the
architects was undertaken, where
three architectural companies were
given the opportunity to compete
for the job of developing a master-
plan for the Union Building. Having
given their presentations to show
why they should be selected, the
company Swanke Hayden Connell
were chosen, as they understood
best the issues facing our students
and the Union building and were
keen to interact with the students
throughout the process.
Following on from this, during the
Easter holidays a working group
(made up of Sabbatical Officers,
Executive Committee members
and House Committee members)
have been meeting regularly with
the Architects about this project,
discussing the current uses of the
building, the problems facing users
and oversight of the process. The
architects have also been looking at
the structural issues that affect the
building to determine what can and
can’t be done.
Last week’s pullout showed
sketched design. The pictures did
not show what will happen to the
Union building but are the initial
drawings from the architects which
they used in the tendering process.
They were given to show their ideas,
spark discussions and generate
thoughts in preparation to receiving
student feedback and development
of the actual brief for the building.
Focus groups will be held with stu-
dents to discuss the building and
how best it can be redeveloped to
reach its potential in serving the
Union’s students.
In June, with all the information
that the architects have gathered,
they will propose a brief for the
building to the Union Council, which
suggests what different areas of the
building will be used for. Once this
is done the process will then be to
expand on these ideas, with the help
of user groups for each of the differ-
ent areas. In October the architects
will give more detailed proposals
of how each of the different areas
of the building will be used. These
will be publicised and you will be
consulted again for feedback. From
then until January, the designs for
the building will be worked into the
final masterplan.
Do have a look at the Union
website; it is intended as an ongo-
ing source of information about the
project so that you can keep up
to date. You can reach it via www.
union.ic.ac.uk and give your feed-
back (yoursay@ic.ac.uk).

The joy of... 24-hour libraries
As most of you have probably real-
ised, the dreaded exam season has
hit Imperial College once again. To
many, that will mean lack of sleep,
too much caffeine, and a growing
realisation that it might have been
a good idea to work a little harder
throughout the year. When they
told you in October that this year
was going to be hard, they actually
meant it!
This year and last, the summer
term has also meant round-the-
clock access to the central library,
thanks to the Union lobbying the
library service on behalf of the stu-
dent body.
Whilst the extended service has
been highly praised, and appreci-
ated by students who value the
added flexibility of being able to use
the library at any point during the
revision period, there have been a
number of consistent complaints.
There has been call for better
ventilation, as a continuous stream
of hard-working students takes its
toll on air quality. The library has
acknowledged this and is currently
asking the College for more money
to enable it to address the problem
properly over the next couple of
years.
Secondly, there is a lack of
refreshments. The library pro-
vides some vending machines in
the Haldane Collection on level 1
(where consuming some food and
drink allowed), but this is limited
by space. There are also vending
machines in the Junior Common
Room, and the Union’s catering
service in Beit Quad is still the only
place on campus to get decent hot
meals until 8.30pm (and later on
Wednesday and Friday evenings).
One of the worst complaints is
regarding the lack of space, par-
ticularly when other users are
“reserving’ desks with their bags
and books. At some points, only two
thirds of spaces are being actively
used, but there are none available,
since the others are being reserved.
The library has tried to combat this
problem by asking users to remove
their belongings when they are
going to be absent for extended
periods, but this has had limited
success and there is not sufficient
staff to ‘police’ the library over-
night.
On behalf of other library users,
I would like to ask you to be con-
siderate and sensible – of course,
it is reasonable to leave your desk
for an hour to get lunch, but if you
are going be gone all night, please
do the decent thing and let oth-
ers use the space. Apart from the
issue of basic courtesy, some people
appear to be quite careless with
valuable belongings. The library is
not your home, and it’s not a good
idea to leave your laptop or iPod
unattended.
I’m sorry if this sounds like a rant
– I suppose it is – but some people
are getting quite fed up. I quote the
comments of one library user on
a feedback form: “I arrive in the
library at 8-9am and leave at 11pm
and I can never get an individual
table by the window... because they
leave their stuff overnight.”
If you do have any feedback
about the library, please contact
library@imperial.ac.uk or fill in a
feedback form in the library.
Best of luck with your exams!

Judgment day for Babar Ahmad
On Tuesday 17 May, the case of
Babar Ahmad looks set to reach its
close, 18 months after events start-
ed to unfold. The case is not only
a terrifying and tragic experience
for Babar, his family and friends,
but also represents a fundamental
attack on all our rights and civil lib-
erties and is an example of so-called
British ‘justice’.
The ordeal started with Babar’s
arrest in December 2003, an arrest
for which there was so little evi-
dence to back up the outrageous
claims of Babar being ‘Osama Bin
Laden’s London General’ that he
was released without charge after
a week of interrogation.
There is, however, extremely
strong evidence pointing to quite
serious abuse (including life threat-
ening injuries) inflicted on Babar
by the arresting officers whilst held
in his cell. However, the only police
officer charged with use of exces-
sive force was recently acquitted by
the supposedly ‘Independent’ Police
Complaints Commission, who ludi-
crously claimed that the officer
concerned acted “professionally
with great bravery. We support his
actions: he should be commended
and not castigated.”
Following his re-arrest on 5 August
2004, Babar has now been impris-
oned for 6668 hours. He is awaiting
a decision on whether he will be
extradited to the US. The extra-
dition request is based on weak
evidence similar to that which led
to his release after his first arrest,
except now the new extradition law
means that Babar’s defence cannot
challenge this. They are merely able
to argue that Babar should be tried
in Britain as he would’t face a fair
trial in the US.
With talk of torture, execution,
Guantanamo Bay and a highly
islamophobic post-September 11
US legal system, his defence cer-
tainly have a strong case. But I
think we have to question, given
the way Babar’s case has unfolded,
whether he is likely to get fair treat-
ment from the British legal system.
If there is indeed no new evidence
obtained since December 2003,
then we should be demanding not ‘a
fair British trial’ but his immediate
release if the extradition request is
not granted.
This is the prospect that we face
on 17 May. Of course, Babar is just
one man against the US and British
governments’ political agendas and
their ‘war of terror’. Of course, all
persons making decisions (like the
one made to recently shut down
Babar’s HSBC bank account with-
out justification or warning, from
which he was paying his elderly
parents’ bills through direct debit)
are connected to the establishment.
But this is also an establishment
that is now on the retreat. We saw
in the general election how Tony
Blair’s New Labour was punished,
largely for the war on terror, both
abroad in Iraq and at home over
civil liberties. This was most notably
exemplified by the victory of George
Galloway for the Respect Party in
Bethnal Green and Bow. Labour’s
majority was slashed across the
board. Babar himself stood from
behind bars in Brent North and
received a very respectable 685
votes. The campaign to free Babar
is gathering momentum – each
demonstration is bigger and better
than the last.
We have to remember that the
judge, however much tied to the
establishment, is just one individual
who does not want to make the
wrong decision. If Babar gets extra-
dited, and in years to come the
absurdity of that decision is high-
lighted, his career will be ruined.
The mass demonstrations outside
court and continued high profile
campaign can tip the balance here.
With this in mind, once again (and
possibly for the last time) Babar’s
friends, family and supporters have
called for everyone to be outside
Bow Magistrates Court, Covent
Garden, at 10am on Thursday 17
May.
If the decision goes against us
and judge agrees to the extradition,
then we need to be there in our
hundreds to let the world know he is
not going without a fight. But if the
judge rules against the extradition
request, then there is a very real
possibility that Babar will walk free
into crowds of his supporters. And
what a glorious sight that would be.
Make Poverty History
The Make Poverty History (MPH)
campaign, mentioned in the first
issue of Felix this term, was suc-
cessfully launched on Monday at a
very well attended meeting. Those
in attendance heard speakers
from Christian Aid, The Guardian,
Globalise Resistance and the NUS
talk about the importance of dem-
onstrating at the G8 and putting
pressure on the leaders of the eight
richest nations of the world, whose
political agendas result in the status
quo of global poverty.
The next stage of this campaign
is to take a motion supporting MPH
to Union Council. That will be done
this evening. Anyone in support of
this motion (which can be viewed
at www.union.ic.ac.uk/meetings/
council/2005/5/12) is requested to
join us at Council. We are meeting
beforehand, at 6pm in the JCR, to
discuss it.
