Discrimination can
lead to illness
A recent survey published by
Imperial College researchers
has found that lesbian, gay
and bisexual people are 10%
more likely to have mental
health problems than het-
erosexuals. The researchers
believe that this is caused by
discrimination and bullying.

Campus food unhealthy and
overpriced, say students
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Mark Field, of the Conser-
vative party, has been re-
elected as MP for the Cities
of London and Westminster,
the constituency containing
Imperial’s South Kensington
campus.
The Conservatives also
comfortably won Kensington
and Chelsea and reclaimed
two nearby seats, in which
a considerable number of
Imperial students live, from
Labour.
Mr Field, who was inter-
viewed in Felix two weeks
ago, took 47.3% of the vote,
compared to 25.1% for Hywel
Lloyd of Labour.
Malcolm Rifkind was elect-
ed in Kensington and Chelsea
with 57.9%. Jenny Kingsley, of
the Liberal Democrats, fin-
ished second on 18.3%.
In Hammersmith and
Fulham, which contains
Charing Cross Hospital, Greg
Hands of the Conservatives
was elected with 45.4% of
votes. The result in neigh-
bouring Putney was one of
the first to be declared on
election night, and Justine
Greening’s victory was the
first strong suggestion that
the Tories were set to make
gains nationwide.
Damian Green and
Adam Afriyie, both of the
Conservative party, were
elected in the constituen-
cies containing the Wye and
Silwood Park campuses
respectively.
Overall, Labour’s major-
ity was slashed to 66. They
now have 356 MPs, the
Conservatives 197 and the
Liberal Democrats 62.
Tony Blair is the only
Labour leader in history to
have won three consecutive
general elections, but his
party was backed by only
around 22% of those eligible
to vote, the lowest figure in
modern times.
Conservatives capture local seats
By Dave Edwards
and Darius Nikbin
Students believe that the
food available on Imperial
College’s main campus is
unhealthy and overpriced,
according to a Felix poll con-
ducted this week.
Of the students interviewed,
only 26% felt that food on cam-
pus was ‘healthy’ and just 32%
believed it was ‘good value for
money’. The poll also shows
that caterers would be wise
to reconsider the nutritional
content of their food, with 67%
of students saying they would
be interested in healthier
options than already exist.
Edward Lilley, Imperial’s
Catering Manager, told Felix
that the College serves food
that is popular with students.
“We provide customers with
what they want,” he said.
Many of the sandwiches
sold in the JCR contain wor-
ryingly high levels of salt and
are significantly more expen-
sive than similar products
offered by local stores such
as Boots, Marks & Spencer
and The Sandwich Shop [see
page 3 for further details].
According to Mr Lilley, the
College has considered ways
of reducing salt levels and
promoting healthy eating:
“We’ve already started ini-
tiatives to reduce salt, such
as lo-salt sachets, [and] we
ran a trial of the Options pro-
gramme on Mondays in the
JCR.”
He also said that students
are given the opportunity to
express their views via annual
surveys and comment cards.
Neither Mr Lilley nor the
Union’s caterers could pro-
vide us with any written nutri-
tional information or healthy
eating policy.
Sam Rorke, Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare) of Imperial College
Union, said: “Obviously it’s
important that students can
get food that’s healthy and
reasonably priced. I think
Union catering has improved
enormously over the last six
months.”
The Union said that it would
always listen to feedback from
students about its catering
and other services.
The survey also brought
up a few unforeseen sugges-
tions. Some students in the
central library, which is open
24 hours a day during the
summer term, asked for food
to be made available later
into the night. One respond-
ent suggested that eating at
the nearby Royal College of
Art was a better option, while
others called for a radical
boycott of College catering.
“Chips with everything?” Meals served on campus, like this fast food in the Main Dining Hall, have received criticism
from students in a Felix poll
