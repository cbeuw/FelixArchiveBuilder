Universities in this country love
to give their students the opportuni-
ty to divert their attention from their
work (in your case) or from club-
bing and girls (in mine). In order to
prevent students from passing the
year, students’ unions create sports
teams.
People join a sports team because:
a) they like playing sports; b) it’s
cool and they think they’re going
to pull more chicks (instead of the
usual 0 girls per year, their aver-
age raises to an astonishing 0.43);
c) they provide the opportunity to
get drunk every Wednesday at the
Union (unless you join the Keraaazy
Archery Club or the Table Tennis
Gangstas).
Sports clubs provide a great envi-
ronment in which to analyse the dif-
ferent personalities within Imperial
College, of which I highlight the
following:
• The arseholes – they were born
for sports. Football flows in their
veins (unfortunately, I can’t say the
same about intelligence), rugby all
over their skin and hockey on their
wrists. They are professional scor-
ing/tackling/dribbling machines, but
it’s a shame that they can’t tie their
own shoe laces or go shopping to
Sainsbury’s without confusing £13.50
with £13,500.
• The geeks – they are nerds and
they know it, but they try to dis-
guise it by joining a cool sports
team, crowded with hardcore party
animals. They love to spend their
pocket money on cranberry juice
to do sick mixes like ‘stroking the
salami on the beach’ (cranberry and
orange juice) or ‘bubbly fizzle’ (coke
and fanta) and down them with
their badminton, ultimate frisbee or
squash mates.
• The losers – they love their sport,
even though they suck and their
team languishes at the bottom of
the league.
• The drunks – members of all
clubs (except table tennis, archery
and badminton), their main objec-
tive is to destroy their livers before
they graduate, so that they won’t
have to worry about finding a job.
They usually spend their after-
noons/evenings/mornings drinking
pitchers and playing drinking games
(such as the famous ‘drinking a shot
every time someone in the room
breathes’).
• The stoners – they love nature
and feeling all the sensations
of the world (and spending their
food budget on drugs). So they join
clubs where they can either be in
altered states of mind (kendo, tai-
chi, karate, yoga or origami) or in
direct contact with God’s touch and
write poetry about what they see
while rock climbing, canoeing or
surfing.
• The teen movie girls – I can’t
imagine a changing room crowded
with naked women without at least
one lesbian fantasy coming to mind.
Come on! If I were female and next
to all these fit and athletic ladies,
I wouldn’t even think twice! I don’t
know if that’s the result of all the
porn I’ve seen since the age of 12
but, please don’t take this dream
away from me!
• The fat smoking bastards – they
know they are fat and lazy, but in
order to feel less guilty, they play
one of those not-having-to-move-
their-arse ‘sports’, such as darts,
snooker or table football.
• The useless wannabes – like
fungi, they are everywhere and you
can’t get rid of them! Usually they
end up in the fifth team licking the
coach’s arse.
• The rich boys – they are crap
at everything they do, but as they
were born with a golden spoon in
their mouth they can afford the best
kit. They usually play really exclu-
sive and expensive sports that no-
one knows how to play or that they
even exist, such as golf, fencing or
cricket.
Personalities apart, there is anoth-
er parallel universe in sports teams
at Imperial: the medics.
I could write a whole column
bitching about them! They think they
are so much better than the mere
mortals like engineers or scientists
that they have to have their own
teams: no mixing allowed! Maybe
it’s the fact that they can’t stand the
idea of getting the shit kicked out
of them (like I will, after the sports
teams read this article) by lousy
non-divine people. Whatever floats
their boat...
My point this week: joining a sports
team is always good because, even if
you suck, it improves your social
skills and maybe your biceps and
abs too. It’s always better spend-
ing a Wednesday afternoon rubbing
your face in a puddle of mud or
someone’s sweaty, smelly or sexy
armpit, than laying in front of the TV
and bloating your belly.
Let’s get physical.
Analyse them
So Channel 4 has finally given up
the fight. They know they’ll never
beat Five for sheer cultural value
any more, and so have swapped
place with them. Now Channel 4 is
the place to scour for poor quality
porn, and Five is the place to go for
interesting documentaries on things
like the ‘the boy whose skin fell off
and was eaten by naughty teenag-
ers’. Which is always a draw. And
bloody FilmFour nicked all the good
movies whilst no-one was watching.
Bastards.
What have Channel 4 replaced the
hard-hittingdramasanddocumenta-
ries with? Will & Grace, Everybody
Loves Raymond and The Top 100
Best Shows That Cause Internal
Haemorrhage. All of these are crap,
especially Raymond, as no-one
loves Raymond. At least no-one with
a modicum of self-respect.
The only good Top 100... show was
in fact the last one, which was all
about cartoons. This is because you
don’t get to watch your favourite
cartoons all that often – when was
the last time you watched Dungeons
and Dragons? All 100 were much-
loved classics, and it was nice to see
them again. The rubbish ‘celebri-
ties’ that intone on them could have
been lost, or preferably shot. But
other than this one ‘gem’, the rest
are bollocks. Why do I care whether
or not Jimmy Carr is the number
one most hated comedian in the
south of Wales? Does it matter?
Obviously the national hatred of a
smug bastard is always good, but
we’ve got Damien Rice for that.
And who votes for these things
anyway? I bet it’s the same bored
housewives that appear on Trisha
for guidance from the Morality
Queen, and therefore these polls
are truly representative. Is this lack
of good TV just because the produc-
ers have become so damn lazy that
repeating the same four-hour show
every week for eternity seems a
good idea? Or is it an edgy social
experiment? Maybe they’re trying
to up the national birth rate – noth-
ing good on TV leads to more sex
through sheer boredom.
Hang on... that’s a bloody good
reason to watch Channel 4... I’ll get
so bored that even I will have sex.
The plan can’t fail. And you say they
just have loads of random porn on it?
Why haven’t I seen this before? Real
boobs, you say? Be right back...
Bloody hell. That was pretty good,
until I had to vote for my favourite
breast moment. £1 for a one second
clip of Jodie Marsh doesn’t make
my bank manager happy. Besides,
I voted for Britney – how was I to
know she wasn’t on the poll?
One hundred reasons

Why is the government so
keen on the arbitrary target
of getting 50% of school leav-
ers to attend University?
Blair et al state that more people
need to be educated to university
level so that the UK can maintain
its position as the world’s fourth big-
gest economy. Obviously, it is impor-
tant to maintain our economy in its
present happy state and university
educated people generally contrib-
ute more to it. But how many highly
educated people does the country
actually need?
The arbitrary target is just that
– arbitrary. There are no targets for
individual subjects. There is a differ-
ence between chemical engineer-
ing or economics and surf science
or tennis. How do these so-called
‘Mickey Mouse’ courses contribute
to the economy? Also, I know the
media is playing an ever-increasing
role in our society, but how many
media studies graduates does the
country really need?
Currently over 40% of people go to
university, many of whom can’t find
a graduate level job. So after years
of toil, they are in the same position
they were in before they went to
university, the only difference being
that they are also saddled with a
massive debts. I wonder how many
of these people agree with the 50%
target.
If a university education were
restricted to those undertaking rele-
vant and useful degrees, there would
not be the need for the introduction
of top-up fees.
It is my opinion that the govern-
ment is only keen on increasing uni-
versity intakes because it reduces
unemployment figures.
I am not arguing that people
should be prevented from going to
university – it is a fantastic opportu-
nity and we are privileged to be here.
It is marvellous that more people
have the chance to go to university,
and the door should remain open to
everyone.
But university is not the only
option. If you have ever had to call
out a plumber, carpenter or electri-
cian, you’ll know that these guys
(there are virtually no women) are
in intense demand. There is a great
shortage of key skilled workers in
the UK, but in schools pupils are
generally not informed of the other
options, such as apprenticeships.
The shortage of tradesmen has
lead to an influx of highly skilled
Eastern European labourers. In line
with the rules of supply and demand,
getting a leaky boiler fixed is now a
serious financial outlay. The earning
potential of the trades has led numer-
ous professionally trained people to
make the switch, notably the doctor
who retrained as a plumber.
If it is common knowledge that
there is money to made being a
tradesman, and the job prospects of
university graduates are continuing
to decline, why aren’t more school-
leavers starting apprenticeships?
The main attractions of university
are the opportunity to move out of
home and live with your friends,
and the ‘debaucherous lifestyle’ it
brings. Conversely, apprentices gen-
erally stay at home, splitting their
time between formal learning and
on-the-job training with people many
years their senior.
This may lead to apprentices
believing they are missing out on the
social benefits provided by univer-
sity. To solve this problem, I propose
residential trade-skill ‘universities’,
where students can learn useful
profitable skills and enjoy the ben-
efits of living away from home.
