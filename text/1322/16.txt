Since it is directed by Ridley Scott
(Gladiator), one would expect
Kingdom of Heaven to impress and
amaze just as much as its predeces-
sor. In this respect, the film does
not fail to please – sweeping battle
scenes, opulent sets and on location
shooting certainly make for astound-
ing pieces of cinematography, which
is the main reason for the three star
rating. Visually, you can expect all
the brilliance of Gladiator, only fit-
ted in with a different genre – one
of the Christian and Muslim armies
against the backdrop of Jerusalem.
The film follows the story of Balian
(Orlando Bloom), a French black-
smith in mourning after the suicide
of his wife, who one day decides
to ride to Jerusalem after being
approached by the father he never
knew (Liam Neeson) and urged to
join the Crusades.
Unfortunately en route to
Jerusalem, Bailan’s father Godfrey
is killed, leaving Balian the sole
beneficiary and heir of his men and
lands in the holy city. While the
father lies dying, he knights his son
and charges him with safeguarding
the fragile peace in the city, protect-
ing the helpless and serving the
leprosy-afflicted king with loyalty.
This he does, speedily evolving
from simple mourning blacksmith
to skilled swordsman, irrigation
expert, surveyor, builder, military
strategist and politician, whilst also
finding time to bed the beautiful
(and married) Princess Sibylla.
What a multitalented blacksmith.
There are two major failings of
the film that prevented it from truly
reaching ‘epic’ status. Number one
was the fact that the plot was rid-
dled with more holes than Swiss
cheese. Balian’s knowledge of irri-
gation and military expertise seem
to appear from nowhere. A possible
(and likely) explanation is that pro-
gression took a long time; however,
the film does not give this impres-
sion.
Problem number two is Balian
himself. Ridley Scott appears to give
Bloom as much screen time as pos-
sible, and this proves to be a huge
failing, mainly because of his lack
of screen presence. The camera is
little more than a terrier trailing
Balian. True, the film is about one
man’s journey and his rude awak-
ening into the world of intertwined
religion, politics and war; but the
film’s scope seems to omit anything
that has no immediate impact on
the central character, whose impas-
sive attitude that he put to good use
as a detached and well-spoken elf
has been used throughout the film.
In fact, he has no other attitude, his
face is always a picture of constant
consternation and grim determina-
tion. His lines are kept to a bare
minimum to save him from embar-
rassing himself, yet he does just
that. His delivery is invariably terse
and over-dramatic.
Whilst some scenes were histori-
cally inaccurate and some battle
scenes were a bit too drawn out for
my liking, this film was certainly
not offensive to watch and provid-
ed plenty of conversation material
afterwards. The dialogue was poign-
ant, with the supporting cast deliv-
ering strong performances on all
fronts. Scott dealt with the issue of
the Crusades sensitively and in such
a manner that neither Christians
nor Muslims were demonised. The
film also raises interesting parallels
between the struggle in the holy
land back in 1180 and events in the
Middle East today.
