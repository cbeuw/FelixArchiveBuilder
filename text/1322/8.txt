The Union building
A letter to the Editor;
I hope that the ICU rebranding
pullout was some kind of sick joke.
Such horrendous marketoid drivel
– “Tertiary Vertical Circulation” –
should have no place in a student
run union, and I feel is indicative of
its descent into institutionalised CV-
priming self-service.
If the union truly want to consult
the student populace, they should
start by declaring how much has
already been spent on architect’s
briefs, and explaining exactly where
the funding for such future develop-
ments will be coming from.
For the union to prosper, I feel
what is required is a greater degree
of student involvement, rather than
a ‘rebranding’ exercise & contin-
ued decay into a business-consumer
relationship. By the students & for
the students, not by a consultant to
screw as much money out of the stu-
dents to pay for more consultants!
The idea of somehow squeezing
the gym into the clearly diminutive
east basement is obscene, and no
extent of buying colour coded chairs
& glass topped wine bars will make
up for it.
Yours,

Dear Felix,
Your double page spread in last edi-
tion 1321 on the future of the Union
building included plans (which were
difficult to read) for each floor in the
Union building.
What surprised me about the
plans was the indication that the
Union Gym, which is currently
used by many and diverse Clubs
and Societies looks as though it will
be replaced with Union offices. So
where will all the Clubs that cur-
rently use the Gym go when the
Union Gym is used to house all the
computers Mr Arif needs for his
electronic ballots?
Into the newly built Sports Centre
at commercial rates? I understand
that the Sports Centre has a strict
mandate to make money out of pro-
viding services to the wider com-
munity, as well as the students at
Imperial, and needs to allocate time
during the week to be able to do this,
penalising student usage.
But why do we need Union offices
moved from their present location
on level 1 to occupy twice the floor
space on levels 2 and 3? The answer
in the plans is that there will be
another bar built on level 1. So four
food/drink outlets in one building,
instead of three, to displace a sport-
ing asset, the Gym.
Unusually, the President is reti-
cent about how this could have
happened, after a motion passed
in December by the Union Council
expressly ruled out the loss of the
Union Gym as a facility for students.
With the Southside Gym about to
shut, and ever increasing numbers
of indebted students turning to hob-
bies and sport instead of drinking
to enjoy themselves outside of lec-
tures, it strikes me that this course
of action in the Union building is
highly risky. He insisted to me that
the Union would be able to pay for
extra space in the new Sports Centre
for Clubs – but I’m not sure how. The
subsidy that the Union gives Clubs
fell last year.
If you need facilities in the Union
that are under threat of demolition,
write to them and tell them! If you’re
in the Fencing club, unsheath your
pens and let them know! If you play
snooker, leave your balls on the table
and break theirs for once! If you
practice any sort of martial art (and
I hear a lot of it going on these days!)
it’s time to apply self-defence to the
venue you use, not just your own
bodies!

Richard Walker, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), responds:
The Union building redevelop-
ment project is one of the most
exciting projects that I have been
involved in during my time as
Deputy President. Following the
development of the Union strategy
that cemented the core objectives
of what our Union should strive to
achieve, it is an important step to
look at redeveloping the inside of
the Union building, one of the finest
on campus, into one that can facili-
tate those objectives.
It was students that decided
how much should be spent on this
design project, it was students that
decided its scope and it is students
that are managing the project and
students that are constructing the
brief and prioritising what is best
for students.
What I, we, the Union are about
to create is a Union building that
has at its heart clubs and societies
and social space that will become a
place where students can balance
their academic work life with their
outside life.
When there are huge demands
on space in area such as South
Kensington I, we, the Union must
use what we have with great care.
We have a responsibility to each
other not to be wasteful. Relocating
office space and student service
space to work next to each other
allows us not only to share space,
but to work together and involve
more students. Relocating gym
hall activity to a single height area
which allows the same activity to
continue without detriment allows
us to extend mezzanine levels to
create added floor space for more
student activity.
I am proud of the passion that
Imperial students have for their
Union and I am humbled to be a
part of it. I have listened to your
comments and I urge you to keep
them coming and I hope that then
I, we, the Union will create a better
place for us all.
Kicking up a Stormy
Dear Ed,
I was slightly disturbed by Stormy
Woods’ article this week. While I
appreciate that she might not be
short of attention in recent times,
is there any particular reason why
she goes out of her way to type-
cast the gentleman accosting her on
the bus as a ‘geriatric arab illegal
immigrant’? And no less on voting
day! While she herself might not
care much for the political parties’
attitudes towards immigration, her
insta-judgement of the average mid-
dle-eastern man in the street being
past their 50’s and possessing no
right of abode in the UK leaves me
questioning why so many foreign-
ers would want to come here in the
first place, at least in their home
countries they aren’t lambasted and
stereotyped in such a dismissive
way!
There are more appealing ways
to try and emulate the Sex and
the City-esque columns that she is
undoubtedly aiming for and from
what I gather Stormy’s plans are
to venture into the medical profes-
sion. She would do well to learn
some manners and tact to go with
her ‘perfectly tanned hairless pins’
(I’ll have to take her word on this
as I haven’t had the opportunity to
see for myself) before being allowed
to see patients, or is she going to
pick and choose who she sees and
treats and see that as acceptable
practice??
I’ve enjoyed some of Stormy’s col-
umns, and I’ve disagreed with some;
but this one I feel has pushed the
boat too far. It’s not big, it’s not cool
and to be honest it’s not right to
judge people the way she has. As for
the cat getting the cream, perhaps
it was the only way to stop her from
making another self-centred, tact-
less comment.

Dear Editor,
In reply to this week’s issue of Felix,
I’d like to express my disappoint-
ment at Ms Woods’ lack of tact in a
time where immigration and racial
prejudice are sensitive topics.
First of all unless a document was
presented by the man in question
during Ms Woods’ 30 seconds of
fame – and i doubt it – stating he was
and i quote “an illegal immigrant” i
believe it’s a borderline-racist and
tactless comment to make particu-
larly when it coincides with election
time.
I would expect better from a future
doctor studying at a respected uni-
versity. Having a foreign accent
doesn’t mean you are an illegal
immigrant and cannot afford a plane
ticket to visit London or any other
city in the world for that matter.
From a woman’s point of view, it’s
true that some men (regardless
of their nationality) have a rather
unsubtle and unattractive way of
showing interest, i have had my
share! However, advertising perfect-
ly tanned legs in a skirt and three
inch heels calls out for attention
but a woman cannot choose where
it comes from; it would be selfish
and unfair to the opposite sex, i am
afraid these are the rules. Being
attractive is not an achievement,
curing cancer is.

Stormy Woods replies:
Thank you for taking the time
to write in. My column is apoliti-
cal, with much irreverence thrown
in for entertainment’s sake. Hence,
election day did not spring to mind
when I wrote the piece. I’m confi-
dent that most Imperial students
would have the intelligence to vote
on policies from the parties them-
selves, not the politically incorrect
rantings of an enfant terrible!
First thing’s first: my perfectly-
tanned hairless pins, and the preju-
dice displayed by the pair of you
when reading about them. It is
perfectly possible to display one’s
assets without appearing slattern-
ly. I should know, being the owner
of several knee-length Prada skirts,
as worn on the day of the presenta-
tion. I’d like to point out that three-
inch heeled fifties pumps – more
specifically, worn with tights and
said skirt – aren’t automatically
becoming of unwanted attention
either. Especially when worn with
a high neckline, tasteful jewellery,
no cleavage and a natural sun-
kissed glow, courtesy of MAC. Do
the words pot, kettle and stereotype
have any relevance to you?
I’m perfectly aware of the per-
ils and pitfalls of typecasting and
ethnicity. Believe me, I’ve had my
share. However, numerous women
at College have had problems with
gentlemen similar to the chap I
rejected on the bus, most notably
those who reside in North Fulham
and Edgware Road, on an almost
daily basis. To put it bluntly, these
men are relatively uncouth and of
Middle Eastern or North African
origin. I wouldn’t have an aver-
sion their existence if they kept
themselves to themselves, like simi-
lar men of different ethnic origins
tend to do. Being of foreign origin
myself, it’s evident I’d have seen
the diverse social strata within my
ethnic group and others – living in
London means that I would have
seen affluent Arabs with their beau-
tiful wives aplenty, so insta-judge-
ment of those from other cultures
with foreign accents is a non-issue.
I agree that the illegal immigrant
assertion is unfair – I got carried
away with the public perception
that the nastier element amongst
foreginers in the UK must auto-
matically be illegally present, and
apologise for castigating them so
hastily.
I would like to conclude by telling
you that doctors aren’t infallible.
We are human first, medics second.
The same goes for the unwashed
gentleman on the bus – should he
pay me a visit as a patient, where
I am confident, he would take a
different tack. There isn’t a single
person who doesn’t harbour preju-
dices; what separates bigots from
the rest is their failure to suppress
theirs.
Alternative exam rules
Dear Editor,
Fortunately, my finals were early
this exam season, but while I’m
sitting here slowly trying to reha-
bilitate myself off caffeine, it has
occurred to me how many things
pissed me off during the exam ses-
sions. In an effort to ensure anyone
with exams left to go do not have to
face these annoyances, I have made
a list of rules people should have
to read and abide to and preferably
should be put at the back of every
course book.
Invigilators:
• DON’T walk up and down the
stairs un-necessarily: The stairs to
the stage in the Great Hall are an
inadequate metal arrangement that
squeaks hideously. You know this,
I know this, so think twice when
deciding if it’s truly necessary to
use them.
• DON’T wear tap shoes: If you
have to pace up and down the hall in
boredom, at least wear trainers or
soft soled shoes. This is not a time
for your highly individual wooden
sandals/leather flat shoes that your
research group find so amusing
(sigh).
• DO make sure you’re paying atten-
tion: It is not difficult to see a hand in
a group of hunched students. When
you see one, at least try to make
some semblance of haste in your
efforts. In addition, I’d like to point
out another fact, ignoring bathroom
breaks, if students put their hands
up, they generally want one of three
things: To know the time, more
paper, paper fasteners (and possibly
doughnuts), can invigilators please
make sure they are in possession of
these things when they go to inves-
tigate hands.
• DO put up seat allocations sen-
sibly:
When revising, it is not possible to
remember your candidate number
or seat location, fact. May I suggest
therefore, that putting the list direct-
ly beside the door to the hall is a bad
idea? Just a few meters further back
would save many crushed feet.
• DO ensure tables don’t wob-
ble: Why is this sooooo difficult,
WWHHHYYY???? The function of
a table is to create a stable level
surface, and none of them do this. I
can only assume table sellers have
a powerful union and are headed
by a very evil sadistic man, maybe
Michael Howard.
Students:
• DON’T stop to talk in a stupid
place: Why do certain people have
a compulsion to stop and talk the
very second they leave the exam
hall? THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE BEHIND YOU trying to
get out of the tiny doors. You are no
better to me than the idiot mothers
with prams that stop to talk in the
middle of busy pavements. Pah.
• DON’T sigh contentently when
you have finished: I haven’t, and it
makes me want to throw things.
• DO dress sensibly: Girls for exam-
ple, you are rubbish and your blad-
ders are weak, accept this and wear
trainers not heels, this will signifi-
cantly reduce walking noise during
your toilet breaks. Guys, this may
be a personal annoyance, but don’t
cover yourself in lynx deodorant the
morning before. You are not 13 and
apart from trying to ignore the smell,
I worry that if my table rocks again a
spark may cause an explosion.
Right, rant over and good luck
everyone,
Sebwin
