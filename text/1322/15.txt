ALBUM REVIEWS
So here comes summer, bringing
wasps, bikinis and Hot Hot Heat,
one of the most criminally undera-
chieving bands to have graced our
shores (via Canada).
Whilst everyone is desperately
running around emulating bands
like Television or Right Said Fred
(I’m onto you, Kapranos), HHH have
been sounding like XTC for ages
already. Their debut album, Make
Up The Breakdown, faded away to
nothing despite its brilliance. The
indie dancefloor slaying Bandages,
from that very album, should
have been number one for a gazil-
lion weeks, but the ‘Great’ British
Government decided that singing
the word ‘bandages’ during the Iraq
War was insensitive and took it off
the air, further adding to our war
crimes.
But look! It’s now 2005 and you’ve
got quirky indie popsters like Franz
Ferdinand and Kaiser Chiefs scaling
the charts: HHH are perfect for this
musical climate. Check out forth-
comingsingleGoodnightGoodnight,
all off-beat drums, bright guitar and
bouncy Hammond organ, instantly
accessible and just clever enough.
It’s bound to sit comfortably on the
play lists of Radio1, XFM, local radio
and, um, even IC Radio.
Let’s take a moment to observe
front man Steven Bays. Originally
he was only the keyboardist, but they
booted the singer and he took over.
He has an ace yelpy Canadian sing-
ing voice, melodic and effortlessly
up-beat.Morenoticeablesomehowis
his incredible man-‘fro: it makes the
hairy one out of Hundred Reasons
look like a billiard ball. Lyrically,
HHH aren’t going to win an Ivor
Novello, relying more on bitchy one-
liners or witty turns of phrase, my
personal favourite being: “Running
with scissors wasn’t smart, I tripped
and cut open your heart!”
Bays’ delivery is the important
thing. I challenge you not to smile
when he starts and ends Island Of
The Honest Man with a frantic a
capella: “I was picked up and then
dropped off in a culture counter-
clockwise turned around.”
There are so many gems here that
it’s hard to pick any out specifically.
Shame On You has a nice latino beat,
and piano-led album track Elevator
is reminiscent of wonderful album
closer In Cairo from their previous
album.
Barring another war, HHH should
be assaulting your eyes and ears for
the foreseeable future. So there you
go, better than wasps and at least as
good as bikinis. James Millen
The name that he records under
may sound awful, but it is honestly
his name. According to his website,
Mr Lindy Vopnfjord (something I
can’t personally pronounce), hails
from Icelandic shores, where he
began to play guitar from the age of
two and toured with his folk-singing
family. His online home also hints
this may all be a lie, so I choose to
believe he was raised by a polar
bear or something. But some people
will say anything. It’s what he sings
that counts.
Lindy certainly has a beautiful
voice. In places it has a raw, gruff,
Scandinavian edge, a bit like a Kelly
Jones you don’t want to kick. In
others it effortlessly soars into the
higher octaves, with a satisfying
vibrato, more like a Matt Bellamy
with the volume turned down. His
folk roots are evident in his songs,
his style of finger picking punctu-
ated by heavy strumming is com-
mon throughout. The ace in Lindy’s
pack is that, unlike his folk con-
temporaries, he hasn’t descended
into beard-stroking quirkiness (à
la Devendra Banhart), but instead
manages a more northern English
indie sound. Rather fittingly, he has
recently signed to new Mancunian
record label My Dad Recordings,
and labelmates such as Jack Cooper
provide a good reference point.
Lead track Beautifully Undone
consists of a delicately plucked
melody with light strings, clearly
highlighting his voice. In The Air
enlists a full band to produce a fuller,
more upbeat sound. It reminds me
of Oxford boys Goldrush at their
most pop, with a jangling backing
overlaid with slide guitar. After All
The Rain Falls is in a similar vein
to the title track. It is more ethereal,
with extremely light synth and piano
underneathgentleguitar.Towardsits
close, strings and drums are brought
in as the song builds, culminating in
cymbal crashes aplenty before dying
back down again. Most interesting is
Look At The Way. Though from the
surface it appears to be a standard
guitar/bass/drums-type track, Lindy
executes some tricky counter melo-
dies to the instrument line. At times
he cautiously borders on being out of
tune, but the closeness of dischord is
skilfully mastered.
While I don’t see him crashing the
charts any time soon, Lindy is the
kind of artist who will build a solid
fan base. And who knows where
that kind of momentum can lead? I
mean, who saw Damien Rice com-
ing? This four track single is worth
eighteen minutes of anyone’s time.

LIVE REVIEWS
Support slots can be tricky things.
On the one hand, you get to play to
audiences larger than you would
probably get if you were headlin-
ing, but on the other hand you have
to win over people who have paid
to see someone else and are prob-
ably getting impatient for the main
event.
Fortunately for Hal, their particu-
lar brand of sunny west coast pop
is very difficult to dislike. Taking to
the Electric Ballroom’s rather small
stage, front man Dave Allen intro-
duces the band in an interminable
Irish drawl, a stark contrast to his
clear and well pitched singing voice.
There’s quite a loud hum of conver-
sation from the disinterested audi-
ence as the band begin their set, but
by the time they’ve played first single
What A Lovely Dance a few songs
in, the crowd are suitably impressed.
Hal may be playing a dingy club
somewhere in north London, but
throughout the half hour-long set
you could swear you were enjoying a
Californian summer.
By the time headline act and
Detroit native Brendan Benson
stepped onto the stage, the Electric
Ballroom was living up to its name
in terms of the atmosphere. The set
started off with the pop tunes that
have earned him his following, lifted
mainly from his two earlier albums.
Midway through, he declared it time
for the “singer-songwriter part of
the show,” so with acoustic guitar
in tow he strummed out the songs
and the crowd sang along with every
heartfelt word. It is a truly amazing
experience when such a large group
of people all connect with the music;
you can only imagine what Benson
was feeling as the crowd became
one big backing vocal. The rest of
the set mainly comprised of songs
from his latest album, Alternative
To Love, which were performed bril-
liantly, sung with a verve and energy
that is so often missing from solo
singer-songwriters.
An alternative to love? I’m not
too sure about that, but listening to
Brendan Benson is a good place to
start. Dom Wong
