Thursday 24 March –
the journey
The journey to Corsica was
far from straightforward. As
a cost-saving exercise we
flew the boats and ourselves
to Alghero in Sardinia using
very cheap Ryanair tickets.
We hired a far-too-small Ford
Focus and stuffed it with kit,
loading the boats onto an
inflatable roofrack. We then
bombed across the top of
Sardinia and caught a ferry
over to Bonifacio in Corsica.
We decided our warm-up
river would be the Taravo. We
got near to the put-in around
dusk and followed the road
until we eventually found a
decent camping spot to set
up. After failing to get one
of the cookers working, we
cooked our pasta dish on a
single ring. We settled down
fairly early after a few mugs
of cheap red plonk with
thoughts of tomorrow’s pad-
dling strong in our minds.
Friday 25 March –
Taravo (by Jim)
I awoke first, got up and
started to sort stuff out.
Eventually the others arose
and we breakfasted on
French bread and cheese
before loading the car back
up and heading to the put-in.
The warm-up rapid was
fine for Patrick and me, only
to be followed by an upside-
down, pretty miffed looking
Chad. Ralph bobbed round
the corner wondering what
was going on as we reunited
Chad with his kit – oh well.
We paddled on down the
river and were beginning to
wonder whether it would get
any more interesting when
we rounded a corner to
see something that needed
inspecting. The river diverged
into three channels, with only
the right being inspectable
from the bank. The extreme
left looked pretty evil and you
couldn’t really see the middle
channel.
Both the middle and right
slots were hardly more than
a boat width across, about
10m long and ended in a 1.5m
drop. We decided to give it a
go with Patrick being used as
the probe while we acted as
bank support/film crew. He
ran it without hassle and eve-
ryone else then went in turn
with no problems. The fun
had started in earnest!
Our next obstacle was a
sweeping turn that looked
pretty nasty. We chose to por-
tage on river right. The rest
of the river proved great fun.
A river-wide stopper greeted
us at one point. We sent the
probe through it and watched
him being forced to roll, so
the rest of us opted to walk
round.
Chad managed to ‘swim’ a
couple more times, and I was
just thinking I’d got away with
it when the river-gods decid-
ed to punish me. Upon fol-
lowing Patrick down a series
of rapids, he decided to wave
me past for the final “innocu-
ous-looking” little drop. I got
cocky and launched over the
top of a rock to be welcomed
by a munchy little hole that
decided to play with me. After
several sessions of sky/river-
bed antics and about five rolls,
I ended up against a rockface
and decided this play-boating
gubbins wasn’t for the likes of
me and made a technical exit.
Very annoying.
After being reunited with
my kit, we headed on down the
remainder of the river. The
road bridge soon appeared
and I removed my wet kit,
left the others and headed
up the road for the shuttle.
Eventually some local farm-
er-types picked me up in their
standard issue Toyota pick-up
and were kind enough to run
me to the car after pretend-
ing to understand my pidgin
French.
After picking up the oth-
ers and the kit, we decided
to head back south towards
the put-in for the Rizzanese.
Unfortunately, it was dark by
the time we got there, and
much faff was had trying
to find a suitable camping
venue. Tents were eventually
set up and more pasta and
cheap wine consumed before
we dozed off to dreams of 10m
waterfalls...
Saturday 26 March –
Rizzanese (by Ralph)
After our pleasant day on the
Taravo, we were looking for-
ward to something more on
the Rizzanese – more excite-
ment, bigger drops, steeper
creeking. We found it.
Everyone successfully tack-
led the first rapid, following
the overeager probe. After an
exciting kilometre, we got to a
nasty 6m fall with rocks in the
bottom. Everyone instantly
decided to walk around it.
Patrick ran a 2m fall sideways
having mucked up the entry
rapid, and surfaced partly in
the cave behind the fall. A
good‘Duracell bunny’ impres-
sion got him clear. More
pool-drop madness followed
– Chad proved that throwing
people in at the deep end gets
results. We portaged another
6m fall, then found ourselves
at the main event, a 2m, 10m,
3m combination of falls.
Patrick and I had talked a
lot about how high 10m actu-
ally was, including scaring
Jim’s missus and my mum by
likening it to a second floor
window in Beit. Well, 10m is
very big. We might have con-
sidered it, had the levels not
been high. As it was, no one
felt brave/stupid enough for
this, and we began a mas-
sive portage. It took nearly
an hour.
Just when we thought noth-
ing more interesting would
happen, Chad provided some
action. One section had a cou-
ple of trees two-thirds of the
way across. Everyone else
made it around them, but
Chad managed to capsize on
the rapid, rolling up just in
time to fight his way through
the branches of the first tree,
only to be hit in the chest by
the trunk of the second. I’d
eddied out just downstream,
and lost no time in getting
onto the bank with a throw-
line. Luckily Chad was simply
wedged on the surface, not
stuck against the bottom, so
was able to pull his deck and
let his boat depart without
him. I roped him to the side
and sent him off to find his
boat, considering bringing a
chainsaw on our next creek-
ing mission.
We continued for what
felt like many miles, every
so often shouting “Ou est la
f**king pont?!” Eventually,
to much rejoicing, “la pont”
appeared. We sent Jim off to
run/hitch the 14km shuttle,
and stood around feeling cold
and sorry for ourselves until
he returned.
As it was already very late
and dark, we opted for the
same camping spot as the
previous night. Something
easier tomorrow please.
Sunday 27 March –
Fium Orbo (by Jim)
After a couple of hours’ driv-
ing whilst getting severely
dripped on, we reached the
Fium Orbo, where the weath-
er chose to brighten up con-
siderably. After checking the
gauge about 0.5km up and
deciding the level was decent,
we pulled up at the closed
café halfway up the river to
be met by a minibus full of
French paddlers in full face
helmets. Chad decided he
was having a rest and would
meet us at the bottom.
We got on to discover a love-
ly continuous pool-drop river
and soon caught up with the
French group. They seemed
to want to inspect everything
and after about a kilometre
of using them as probes, we
got bored and overtook them.
About halfway down we came
across a 2m drop that had
a dodgy looking siphon, so
went for the portage river
left. This required an excel-
lent 3m seal-launch back into
the river.
Another interesting rapid
followed, requiring a seal-
launch past the start on river
right. Patrick managed this
fine, but upon landing I decid-
ed my helmet hadn’t been suf-
ficiently tested yet, so opted
to do the rapid upside down,
rolling up at the bottom – oh
well.
We carried on down to just
before the gauge, where the
leaky boat and nasty look-
ing rapid made me decide
it was time to exit. Patrick
opted to run this one, which
consisted of a double drop
that flushed into a cliff-face.
For some reason he thought
that the second drop was best
attempted upside-down, and
literally ended up climbing
the wall to get out of an awk-
ward situation!
Chad had found us by this
time, and we hauled the
boats back up to the road and
then went to recover the car.
Once we were back on the
road again, we headed south
towards the Travo. After get-
ting the tents up with much
bending of pegs, we cooked
dinner, made a dent in the
whisky and attempted boat
repair – Blue Peter style!
Eventually we went to sleep
knowing that the following
day we would be paddling the
most famous (or infamous)
river in Corsica – the Travo.
Monday 28 March –
Travo (by Patrick)
I had seen this river from the
road the day before and got
quite excited. We parked the
car at the get-in where a sign
told us that we could only be
on the river between 10am
and 6pm. It’s not going to take
that long, I told myself... how
wrong I was.
The river was full of loads
of amazing pool drops that
were either run or portaged
fairly easily. This, however,
was the exception to the rule.
A set of rapids were decided
to be “not worth it”, but I
wished I had paddled them
now. The portage consisted
of trying to drag the boats
over 45 degree smooth rocks,
which was a nightmare task.
However, after much effort,
we got back in and carried on
down. We then came to the
crux of the river, the reason I
was so excited about Corsica
– the amphitheatre falls.
The photographs were of
picture perfect smooth falls
over smooth bedrock in a
breathtaking rock amphithea-
tre-like gorge. The inspection
was difficult and the water
was higher than I had seen
in the photos. The first drop
looked easy enough, but the
larger second one could not
be seen easily. We all ran the
first drop and managed to get
out to look more carefully at
the second drop. At that point,
another group of paddlers
arrived. Their big creek boats
and full-faced helmets meant
they had to be German. I was
proved correct and the leader
ran the second drop without
even getting out of his boat
to have a look. This was all
the convincing I needed, and
I quickly jumped in my boat
and copied exactly what he
did. The others opted for the
portage.
At this point we realised the
time and exactly how much
river we had left to do. After
discussion, we decided to
keep on going. Another ardu-
ous portage around the killer
rapid followed. We were all
very tired but no end was in
sight and we had to keep on
going. What happened next is
probably one of the most odd
situations I have had in my
kayaking career
An easy boulder garden led
into a chunkier rapid around
a bend. I, for some reason,
decided to go upside down in
the easy bit and my paddles
were ripped from my hands.
I hand-rolled up and man-
aged to get myself into the
smallest of eddies which I
could only stay in by holding
onto the rocks. My paddles
floated down the rapid but
were luckily caught by our
good friends the Germans.
There was, however, no pos-
sible way of getting them to
me. In the end I had to try
to cross the river with just
my hands as paddles. This
proved unsuccessful and I
was washed quickly towards
the oncoming chunky rapid.
Desperation led to Ralph
throwing my paddles, using
the best javelin technique I
have ever seen, straight into
my open hands. I then man-
