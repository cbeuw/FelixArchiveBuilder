Nicole Kidman stars as UN inter-
preter Silvia Broome, a cosmo-
politan linguist who accidentally
overhears a whispered conspiracy
that might be an assassination. She
never sees them, but they spot her,
yet she doesn’t report the incident
until the next day, after she learns
that Matobo’s dictator, Zuwanie
(who has been accused of ethnic
cleansing and brought up on charg-
es of genocide in the World Court),
is coming to the UN to make a
speech.
Coincidence? That’s what Secret
Service agent Tobin Keller (Sean
Penn), a professional cynic, wants
to know. Silvia is uncommunicative
about her past and secretive about
her present.
The Interpreter is touted as the
first commercial movie to shoot
inside the United Nations, which
means that this thriller is blessed
with a truly incredible set-piece.
The movie also boasts two of the
best actors around – Kidman and
Penn, along with director Pollack,
are all Oscar winners. By all meas-
ures, The Interpreter should be one
of the sharpest movies around, but
it is not. It is intelligent, intriguing
and topical, but too often it gets
bogged down in its own good inten-
tions.
The United Nations serve as little
more than an inspired backdrop for
what turns out to be political thriller
that, while often gripping, is neither
as clever as it tries to be or as politi-
cally savvy as it pretends to be.
The writers take care to make mis-
interpretation itself a bit of a motif
by playing with it in small ways, with
smaller discussions throughout the
movie – very clever. The dialogue
between Penn and Kidman is sharp,
interesting and at times rich. Their
acting is powerful and compelling.
The screenwriters enjoy painting
her as the word-lover, the linguist;
she listens. And they paint Penn
as the face man – he peers into the
eyes of his subjects and tosses them
some line to see if they choke them-
selves. He doesn’t seem to trust
their words as much as his gut feel-
ing regarding their sincerity.
If there was ever a romantic sug-
gestion between the two damaged
loners, removed from the social
world because of the pain of loss,
Kidman and Penn do away with
it completely. The heat of danger
may break down the fence between
them momentarily, but back in the
calm they retreat into their shells.
Unfortunately, the script gives them
nothing beyond their dramatic trag-
ic pasts and Pollack doesn’t seem
interested in filling in the blanks.
Instead it’s another one of the film’s
corny storylines – it just seems as
though they’ve ripped off ideas from
other films with the intention of
making them look a bit tacky.
If you start to think, you might
ponder why an emotionally frac-
tured agent would be in charge of
such a powder-keg situation. Or why
Kidman’s character isn’t taken into
protective custody immediately. Or
why the US intelligence agencies
are so, well, damn stupid.
That’s not to say the film doesn’t
have any fascinating or surprisingly
funny scenes. At one point, with the
Secret Service shadowing three dif-
ferent figures, the characters and
their American shadows all con-
verge on the same city bus. The
editing (by William Steinkamp) is
something to behold. He juggles
multiple stories, characters and
perspectives, keeping the narrative
line impossibly clean while building
an old-fashioned sense of tension
and suspense by slowly building the
tempo, paced by Penn’s perform-
ance as the Secret Service point
man choreographing his agents
while pondering the real meaning
of the “coincidence”.
But apart from the film’s climactic
bus sequence and another nicely
crafted sequence towards the mov-
ie’s end, this thriller never visually
builds much tension or suspense.
Catherine Keener (Being John
Malkovich) is sadly underused in
the role of Keller’s wise-cracking
partner. This is probably due to poor
script development. Had this been
expanded a bit more, the film could
have been more than just average.
The Interpreter is ultimately flu-
ent in many things, but an out-and-
out thriller it is not. Haj Alttahir
