America puts Darwin on trial
Last week, authorities in Kansas took steps to reintroduce religious teaching into the school science
curriculum. Darius Nikbin looks at the trial of Charles Darwin’s work and the spread of ‘intelligent design’
On trial: is it right for ‘intelligent design’ to be taught alongside evolution?

Is it you or I who should be in the asylum?
People with severe personality disorders, such as schizophrenia, are often perceived
to be a danger to the public. But most are a danger to no-one, and some abnormali-
ties in behaviour can lead to highly creative phases. So why do we lock them up?
AMERICA ON EVOLUTION
“Evolution is as well-documented as any
phenomenon in science, as strongly as the
Earth’s revolution around the Sun rather than
vice versa. In this sense, we can call
evolution a fact”
Stephen Jay Gould, Harvard paleontologist
“All the ills from which America suffers can be
traced back to the teaching of evolution”
Three time democratic candidate for the presidency,
William Jennings, 1925
“The monkey mythology of Darwin is the
cause of permissiveness, promiscuity, pills,
prophylactics, perversions, abortion,
pornotherapy, pollution, poisoning and
proliferation of crimes of all types”
Judge Braswell Dean of the Georgia State Court
of Appeals, 1981
“I’d make it a goal to make sure that local folks
got to make the decision as to whether or not
they said creationism has been a part of our
history”
George W Bush, Associated Press
“He doesn’t really care about that kind of thing”

Charles Darwin has finally
been brought face to face
with the religious authorities.
Despite never being tried in
his own lifetime, last week the
Kansas Board of Education
began making their case
against the father of modern
evolutionary theory.
The courtroom took evi-
dence from six anti-evolu-
tion scientists arguing that
Darwin was guilty of prolif-
erating a theory that fails
to explain gaps in the fos-
sil record, the complexity of
DNA, or the origin of life.
Outside,boycottingthetrial,
irate mainstream scientists
demonstrated against the
proceedings – but in vain. The
State Board of Education’s
conservative majority is set
to push through legislation
ensuring that pupils are
taught to challenge the basic
precepts of evolution.
One of the witnesses at trial,
Jonathan Wells, explains his
motivation: “Father’s words,
my studies and my prayers
convinced me that I should
devote my life to destroying
Darwinism.” Dr Wells is an
embryologist and senior fel-
low at the Discovery Institute
in Seattle.
The witnesses for the pros-
ecution in the Kansas trial
include William Harris, a pro-
fessor of medicine, who said
that Darwinism clashed with
the biblical teaching that life
was created by God. “Part of
our overall goal is to remove
the bias against religion that
is currently in schools,” he
said. “This is a scientific con-
troversy that has powerful
religious implications.”
Up until now, ‘creation sci-
ence’ has lost every legal
challenge associated with
the creationism-evolution
debate.
In 1982, a federal judge
ruled that ‘creation science’
has no scientific significance
and is merely an attempt to
promote religion. In 1987 the
supreme court ruled that bib-
lical creationism must not be
taught in tandem with evo-
lution in the US. Even so,
creationism continues to be
taught in many schools.
Creationists have, there-
fore, been forced to adapt
their tactics. Theories of
‘intelligent design’ are
becoming more popular as
a substitute for the banned
literal interpretation of the
Bible. ‘Intelligent design’
posits that life’s complexity
cannot be explained without
a supernatural creator or
architect. Earlier this year, a
high school in Pennsylvania
made history by becoming
the first in the country to
discuss teaching ‘intelligent
design’. Critics suggested
that this is simply a back-
door to allowing non-empiri-
cal creationist theories to be
taught.
With legislators in Alabama
and Georgia also consider-
ing Bills to allow teachers to
challenge Darwin in class,
millions of schoolchildren
in the United States will be
taught to question Darwin’s
theory of evolution by natu-
ral selection. Christian fun-
damentalist activists have
ensured that non-empirical
‘guiding-hand’ teleological
explanations will be taught
alongside established scien-
tific theories of evolution.
In parts of the US, it
appears that religious and
scientific education are now
overlapping. After all these
years, the ideas propound-
ed in Darwin 1859 book The
Origin Of The Species have
failed to gain the accept-
ance of the moral majority.
To many Americans, it seems
that nothing could be more
subversive than suggesting
that humans are apes.
“...my prayers
convinced me that I
should devote my life
to destroying
Darwinism”
