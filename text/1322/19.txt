Imperial’s second XI moved
a step closer to a place in the
semi-finals of the ULU Cup
after beating UCL
’s second XI
by a whopping margin of 142
runs at Harlington.
The day began on a good
note for Imperial seconds
when skipper Karthik won
the toss and elected to bat
on a pitch that had a tinge of
green to it.
Vaibhav and Karthik
began well for Imperial, with
Vaibhav pouncing on anything
short and cracking a few early
boundaries to get the innings
moving. Karthik compli-
mented Vaibhav’s attacking
stroke play with a mixture of
tight defence and some wristy
shots square of the wicket.
The 50 partnership came
up in the tenth over but just
when the batsmen looked set
for more, they were dismissed
against the run of play.
54 for no wicket soon
became 56 for 4 as Imperial
suffered a mini-collapse with
Karthik, Vaibhav, Al and Peter
succumbing to a mixture of
poor judgement and careless
stroke play. UCL had fought
back strongly but Imperial
had enough batting depth to
weather the storm. Jacob set
about rebuilding the innings
with some good sensible
batting and built partner-
ships with Avi, Khurram and
Devesh.
Soon defence turned into
single-hunting, gliding and
efficiently flicking in the gaps,
and gradually Imperial accel-
erated, with ones turning
into twos and the odd bound-
ary being poached. When he
finally fell in the 36th over,
Jacob’s fantastic knock of 60
had taken Imperial from a
perilous position to a very
competitive total. Jibran then
used the long handle to good
effect and Imperial finished
on 193-9 after 40 overs.
Imperial’s fast bowlers,
led by Jibran, then pro-
duced inspired spells in the
afternoon as UCL found
themselves in deep trouble.
Jibran’s terrific spell of fast
bowling with his late swing-
ing deliveries left the UCL
batsmen looking as confused
as a child in a topless bar. A
good piece of fielding resulted
in the first wicket when Asif
found himself inches short of
the batting crease.
Subby then picked up a
couple of wickets, with Jacob
pulling off a tremendous
catch at backward point. Avi
and Pete continued the good
work with some accurate and
disciplined bowling as the
UCL batsmen crumbled, una-
ble to handle the pressure.
Although Imperial’s fielding
was quite good overall, Jibran
was unlucky to have a cou-
ple of catches dropped off his
bowling. Pete Munro then put
an end to UCL
’s misery with
a perfect yorker to bowl them
out for a mere 51.
On the whole it was a clini-
cal and proficient team per-
formance from the Imperial
second XI, which has almost
secured its place in the semi-
finals. The exceptional talent,
commitment, dedication and
spirit should ensure that the
team goes the entire distance
in this tournament.

Imperial’s second men’s cricket team, who comfortably overcame the challenge of their
UCL counterparts
to score any points.
The fast pace of the first
half did not slow in the sec-
ond. The pack were brilliant
to watch in the scrum, and if
LSE did manage to win the
ball, Liz’s quick breaking off
made sure that their number
8 didn’t get very far.
Early in the second half
Suzie, after moaning in the
minibus about how she knew
she was going to get hurt, dis-
located her knee after a heavy
tackle and had to be whisked
to hospital. As a result, Jess
was drafted in to replace the
injured flanker. New to this
position, Jess played with
strength and determination
adding to Wye’s tackling abil-
ity.
Suzie’s injury provoked a
major attack. It was payback:
no-one injures a Wye player
and gets away with it. The
tackles consequently got
harder and more aggressive.
For most of the half there
were bodies from both teams
all over the pitch, indicat-
ing the high intensity of the
game. Emily scored Wye’s
third try 20 minutes before
the end with an inventive run
which ultimately, along with
her tackles, earnt her the
most valuable player award.
Andrea kicked the conversion
to put Wye 17-0 infront.
Andrea’s performance
throughout the game was
excellent, all the time mak-
ing crucial tackles and kick-
ing down field as much as
possible.
Lil made some terrific
breaks on the left wing and
was very unlucky to score a
try, as she certainly deserved
one. Towards the end of the
game, Wye’s determination
not to concede was immense.
Gemma battled to the end
with an ongoing injury dis-
playing awesome courage,
while Lou was propelled into
the air at every lineout, steal-
ing many LSE throw-ins. Kate
had a great game as full-back,
adding a sense of calm to the
team.
Overall, it was a truly inspi-
rational performance by the
whole team. It was great to
see the utter determination
and superb teamwork dis-
played by everyone on the
pitch. The match was a once
in a lifetime opportunity to
achieve something for Wye
ladies’ rugby and for Wye
College and I’m delighted
that the team’s hard work
throughout the life of the club
was finally fulfilled.
The cup final marked the
end of the Wye rugby sea-
son and was the last game
for many of the older play-
ers. This win was a perfect
way to end the year and left
the team on an eight match
winning streak. No-one ever
thought with the founding of
the team, three years ago,
that we would ever achieve
the success that we have this
season.
Special thanks must go to
Andrea for founding the Wye
ladies’ rugby team, to all our
supporters over the season,
and of course to our amazing
coach, Hugh, who has shared
his knowledge, time and
experience of the game with
us. Personally, I would also
like to congratulate the team
and thank them for their com-
mitment, support and enthu-
siasm throughtout the entire
season.
The year’s success will
never be forgotton, espe-
cially by those leaving this
year. Wye will not be the
same without them and I
hope they’ll always remem-
ber the overwhelming feeling
when the final whistle blew
at the end of the cup final.
I wish all the leaving play-
ers – Andrea, Annie, Hetty,
Emily, Lou, Suzy, Liz, Lynette
and Gemma – all the best
in the future, in particular
with their rugby. You will be
missed.
The team will carry on and
play next season, with this
year’s freshers hopefully
continuing to play rugby. Our
success will be hard to beat,
but in true Wye spirit we’ll
always battle on and tackle
anything, any shape or size,
on the pitch.
Even though Wye College
is sadly losing its agricultural
and science students, ladies’
rugby will still continue at the
forefront of sport at Wye for
as long as possible.
Wye has a crown, now the
ladies’ rugby team have a
cup. What a fantastic achieve-
ment.
