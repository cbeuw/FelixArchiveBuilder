Detectives were alerted to
Alan Turing’s ‘crime’ when he
and his gay lover reported a
burglary in 1952. The father
of the modern computer and
Enigma code breaker was
later charged with ‘gross inde-
cency’ and given the choice of
prison or a year of oestrogen
injections to neutralise his
libido. He chose the therapy,
and committed suicide a year
later.
Yet although homosexual-
ity is no longer considered
a crime or mental illness,
bullying and harassment of
lesbians, gay men and bisex-
ual (LGB) men and women
continues, and we have little
understanding of its effect on
mental health. Now scientists
have discovered that physical
and verbal abuse may be driv-
ing some gays and lesbians to
suicide.
A recent survey published
by Imperial researchers into
the mental health of LGB peo-
ple found that gay men and
lesbians in the UK were 10%
more likely to have mental
health problems than het-
erosexuals. Most crucially,
the link between abuse and
attempted suicide shows that
homophobic attacks really
can damage people.
Imperial psychiatrist Dr
James Warner discussed his
findings in his office at St
Mary’s Hospital. He told Felix:
“Gays, lesbians and bisexuals
are at a greater risk of mental
disorder and deliberate self-
harm than heterosexuals. We
think this may be caused by
discrimination and having
been bullied at school.”
This is the first study to
show the potential effect of
discrimination on mental
health and the biggest clinical
survey of its kind in the UK.
It involved over 2000 people,
just over half of whom were
lesbian, gay or bisexual.
Warner and his colleagues
needed to find a sampling
technique that would avoid
biasing the study, a particular-
ly difficult issue when you are
surveying a dispersed popula-
tion group. He explained the
recruitment techniques they
used: “It’s easy to recruit
LGB men and women in gay
venues, but these people are
more comfortable with their
sexuality than those who
don’t go out. So to avoid bias
we used a snowball sampling
method that works friendship
networks.”
It works like this. The first
wave of people (group A) is
recruited via posters in health
clubs and public libraries,
adverts in the national, local
and gay press, etc. Group A
do the questionnaire and are
given five postcards to pass
on to friends who would be
prepared to take part: group
B. No sexuality requirement
is made. Group B then nomi-
nates group C, and so on up
to group G.
Participants completed a
computer questionnaire with
questions about the mental
health symptoms they had
experienced in the previ-
ous week, such as fatigue,
memory problems, sleep dis-
turbance, irritability, worry
about physical health, depres-
sive thoughts, general anxie-
ty, compulsive behaviour and
obsessive thoughts. This is a
standard procedure to assess
mental health, termed the
Clinical Interview Schedule
(CIS). They were also asked
to describe their sexual ori-
entation, indicating sexual
attraction on a scale of 1 to
5, with 1 indicating attraction
only to the opposite sex; 2,
mostly to the opposite sex; 3,
both sexes equally, etc.
The survey found that 42%
of the gay men, 43% of lesbi-
ans and 49% of bisexual men
and women had a clinically
recognised mental health
problem, and nearly one third
had attempted suicide.
Damage to property, per-
sonal attacks or verbal insults
in the last five years or insults
and bullying at school were
reported by 83%, two thirds
of whom attributed this dis-
crimination to their sexual-
ity. Mental health problems
(high CIS scores) were linked
to unemployment, conflict
between religious belief and
sexuality, being under 40,
being attacked in the last five
years, being verbally assault-
ed in the last five years and
having been bullied at school.
Out of the whole sample, 31%
had attempted suicide. This
was linked to discrimination
and school bullying, but not
higher CIS scores.
Warner said: “The results
of this research show that
there is a likely link between
levels of discrimination and
an increased risk of mental
health problems. Of course
it cannot be proven to be a
causality, but many respond-
ents linked attacks with their
sexuality.”
NoneoftheLGBcounselling
groups that I contacted found
the link between discrimina-
tion and mental illness sur-
prising. Allan Wardell, press
officerforStonewall,toldFelix:
“Physical attacks on LGB
people and damage to prop-
erty have severe implications
for mental health. The study
highlights the need for the
police and Crown Prosecution
Service to be aware of these
issues and to take them seri-
ously. Lesbians, gay men and
bisexual men and women
need to be assured that the
police can be trusted to treat
them fairly.”
He also spoke of the impor-
tance that health profession-
als be fully aware of the spe-
cific needs of LGB people.
He says: “We’ve seen a high
incidence of mental health
problems in LGB people for
many years. The fact that
only half of gay men are not
out to their GPs has implica-
tions on the health treatment
that they are given.” Training
for mental health profession-
als should include increased
awareness of the potential for
substance misuse and self-
harm in this group, he says.
The Imperial study finds rel-
evance beyond the police and
NHS: it has implications for
how all of society deals with
gay people. This is a group
of people, one in 20 Brits,
who have been oppressed for
many years.
The Right Rev Richard
Harries, Bishop of Oxford,
commented on the study’s
findings, saying that the
high levels of discrimination
reported are “disgraceful”.
He says the study “reveals
that there is a residue of
extremely unpleasant homo-
phobia around. We are, unfor-
tunately, still a long way from
being a society that is truly
inclusive and is sensitive and
respectful to those who are
different from the majority.’
So can we accept people
for who they are or not? Alan
Turing was very open about
his sexuality, and was perse-
cuted for it. As young gays are
increasingly open about their
sexuality, we need a society
that can respect and accept
them. This study is a stark
reminder of what can happen
if we do not.

Discrimination can lead to suicide
A study at Imperial has suggested gays and lesbians suffer a higher risk of mental disorder due to
discrimination. Sophie Hebden talked to the lead researcher and reports on the findings

It takes an average of 20 min-
utes of concentrated effort
to attain, but normally only
lasts 30 seconds. It has been
baffling inexperienced teen-
age boys since the dawn of
time, but the female orgasm
has also puzzled evolutionary
biologists.
The male orgasm is a brief
feeling of intense pleasure,
coupled with ejaculation of
semen containing sperm with
the male’s DNA. It’s essential
when it comes to passing on
those highly desirable genes.
The female orgasm, however,
seems unnecessary for mak-
ing babies, but according to
some new theories it may be
a clever way of ensuring a girl
gets what she wants out of
her man.
If the male partner is capa-
ble of making her reach a cli-
max, he must be physically fit,
so the female can be assured
that any offspring will be
healthy. However, there are
no guarantees of healthy off-
spring, since we can all pass
on faulty genes we’re not
aware we have.
A more likely reason for
female orgasms is incentive:
she will be more likely to have
sex with her man again if she
enjoys the experience, and so
the chances of conception are
increased.
There are also more practi-
cal explanations for this ener-
getically costly experience.
During orgasm, a woman’s
pelvic muscles, vaginal walls
and uterus contract, and the
position of the uterus tilts
slightly.Thesemovementsare
thought to direct the semen
towards the uterus. This may
be the reason why women can
experience multiple orgasms.
Interestingly, the after-
effects of an orgasm may
be just as important as the
climax itself. The feeling of
exhaustion that follows such a
peak of pleasure encourages
the female to stay lying still
after sex, helping to retain the
sperm inside her.
These reasons all refer back
to when we had caves, not
beds, and making babies was
our top priority. Now, how-
ever, it is not necessarily so.
There is another theory more
in keeping with our times:
being able to make your part-
ner feel amazing will make
them less likely to stray, and
more likely to want to return
the favour.

bisexuals are at a

disorder and deliberate
self-harm than
