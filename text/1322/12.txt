CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk
By Jarvist Frost
We left the villa by 10am and
were soon wiggling our way
up the fantastic bends of the
C710, then down towards Sa
Compana, flying over the
beautiful Scalextric-inspired
270 degree bridge bend.
We were faffing with ruck-
sacks when an enormous
mountain police 4x4 roared
up and three men in oh-so-
tight lycra dived out clutch-
ing gleaming tackle bags
of prepacked kit. Gerardo
applied his language skills
and discovered that the men
in tights were three eighths
of the entire Cave Rescue
Organisation for the Balearic
Islands, doing a light spot of
training for the day.
They shot up the mountain-
side and we waddled slow-
ly after them, following the
many cairns along the ridge
walk, then the vast quantities
of red spray paint around to
the entrance. The limestone
was sharp but grippy, though
if you stumbled on the scree it
was an awful long way to the
valley floor!
As we caught up with
the Cave Rescuers at the
entrance, we eyed up each
other with equal bemuse-
ment – us with disbelief at
their shiny scratch-free Pretzl
metalwork, them at the sight
of the finest Yorkshire mud
that we had imported into
the country. I really wonder
whether UK cavers have an
entirely inverted view of cav-
ing equipment compared to
the rest of the world. We view
new, shiny kit with suspicion
and an assumption of inex-
perience, whereas the conti-
nent sees inexperience in not
keeping every item gleaming
and serviced.
Entrance pitch was a pleas-
ant daylight 10m abseil down
a steep slope into what would
be a very large chamber
indeed for the UK – some-
thing you could easily squeeze
Beit into. Once everyone was
safely down, we wandered
around the corner into the
cave itself.
Big doesn’t even start to
describe it. There were enor-
mous formations, stalagmites
and flow stone (a smooth
calcite deposit) larger than
houses, curtains (lines of
moulded together stalactites)
larger than a façade on Oxford
Street, and gour pools (crystal
pools formed by water drop-
ping onto flow stone) that
would have seemed more
at home on Brighton beach.
Amazing stuff.
We orbited the little tea-
lights showing our path back
out of the chamber, calling to
each other across the many-
second echo and generally
exploring this wholly out-of-
this-world landscape. The
chamber is the size of four
football pitches side by side,
and tall enough to consume
the Blackett Laboratory.
We continued down on
rope, along a 60m long piece
of smooth flow stone that
started out horizontal, then
got steadily steeper until
almost vertical – not a place
for the unwary! Just beyond,
there is a little muddy cham-
ber, absolutely filled with
candles from previous cave
trips. We cracked open our
Darren drum of baguettes, a
very pleasant lunch by can-
dlelight!
The rest of the extensive
cave is reached by crawl-
ing through a gap not much
larger than a television, and
here you can notice the very
strange ‘breathing’ of the
cave. Three seconds breathe
in, two seconds hold, three
seconds breathe out. The
very bottom is just three
metres above sea level, and
it is believed that there is a
submarine tunnel too small
for a human (or merely as yet
undiscovered) connecting the
cave with the sea, resulting
in the Mediterranean waves
causing air to be sucked
in and out. Truly a freak of
nature!
The speedy Spaniards soon
overtook us coming the other
way, and after sorting out the
inevitable cat’s cradle of rig-
ging when two groups do the
same cave, we decided it was
getting late and so began our
ascent. It was Gerardo and
Pella’s first SRT [rope] trip,
so progress was fairly sedate
but very pleasant.
The sunshine was glorious
as we exited, gobbling banan-
as and Haribo before ambling
along the 90 minutes of steep
mountain back to our cars.
We drove on to the seaside
resort, sitting outside for a
coffee in the gathering twi-
light. While having a hopping
race from the beachfront back
to the cars, we bumped into
the Rescuers staying in the
resort overnight, managing
a stilted conversation about
the size and impressiveness
of the cave while pretending
not to huff and puff from our
wacky race.
ICCC is planing to run one
last weekend trip this year
suitable for first-timers.
Exact date TBA, but some
time in June – see our web-
