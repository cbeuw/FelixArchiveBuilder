When you thought about coming
into higher education, you had to
take the following factors into con-
sideration:
• Where will I be living?
• Can I afford it?
• Have I made the right choice of
course?
If you are now a student with chil-
dren, you have even more to think
about:
• Does the university have childcare
facilities?
• Do they offer financial help for
childcare?
• Are there any benefits accessible
to single parents?
Being a student while you have
children can be a real challenge, but
your ambitions should not be held
back just because you have started
a family.
Some institutions do not offer
childcare facilities at all. This is
often an issue upon which students’
unions campaign.
At Imperial, a childcare facility is
provided at Princes Gardens for the
children of both staff and students.
It caters for babies and children
aged from six months to five years,
and can accommodate around 54
children. However, there is a long
waiting list.
Students with children may be eli-
gible for some benefits. If you meet
the criteria, you may well be eligible
for the following:
• Parents Learning Allowance
– This is intended to help cover your
course related costs. How much you
get depends on your income and
that of your partner or spouse if you
have one. The maximum entitle-
ment is £1,300.
• Childcare Grant – If you have
responsibility for a child under the
age of 15 (or 17 if (s)he has special
educational needs) and you use reg-
istered or approved childcare, you
may be able to apply for the child-
care grant.
• Lone Parents Grant – This is
only available to students who
started their course before
September 2001. It is not income
assessed but if you are eligible for
this grant then you cannot claim the
childcare grant.
This is just a snapshot of the sup-
port that is available and, as men-
tioned before, not everyone will eli-
gible for this help.
If you are a student parent and
would like more information on both
the Early Years Education Centre
and student parent benefits, please
do not hesitate to contact The
Information And Advice Centre on
020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.
Pop in and see us in the east wing
basement of Beit Quad, and you may
even get a cup of tea!
Don’t let your concern turn into
a crisis. Make the Information and
Advice Centre your first choice for
all your welfare needs.

Union Colours 2005
Is there someone you want to recog-
nise for their contribution to student
life at Imperial? Perhaps someone
who has been a powerful advocate
for representing student views in
your department? Or perhaps some-
one who has played an outstanding
role in helping to run your club or
society?
The Union’s Colours and other
awards are made annually to indi-
viduals who have supported the
aims and objectives of the Union:
representation, student welfare,
clubs and societies and provision of
services. Any person (including staff
or someone from outside College)
may be nominated. Any full member
of the Union (ie any student) may
send in a nomination. Nominations
open today and close on 25 May.
Details are available on the web at
www.union.ic.ac.uk/colours.
Governance changes… and
more elections!
There has been consensus this
year in the Union Executive that we
need to elect the bulk of our offic-
ers, Council and Executive, before
the summer holiday, so that they
may be trained and in post for the
start of the new academic year.
(Historically, we have elected many
positions at the start of the year.)
Together with the creation of the
post of Deputy President (Graduate
Students), this has necessitat-
ed a look at our Constitution and
Regulations.
In line with the Union Strategy
agreed by Council, the Executive
have been developing proposals
that should make the Union more
accountable. At the heart of this
are two symbiotic proposals. The
first is to make the Union’s man-
agement committees (especially the
Executive and the Student Activities
Committee) more effective by giving
them appropriate responsibilities
and reforming their memberships.
The second is to remove all Officers,
except the Executive, from Council.
The remaining places on Council
would be filled by elected represent-
atives from each faculty or depart-
ment – so that there is a majority
of non-Officers who are able to hold
the Officers to account.
The proposals should be discussed
at Union Council tonight and then
hopefully passed at an ‘adjournment
meeting’ on Monday. Assuming all
is agreed, elections for a plethora
of positions will start taking place
shortly.
Linstead Hall and Southside
closure
Much of my time has been occupied
with the future of Linstead Hall.
The position agreed by the Union
Executive has been that we should
aim to retain a catered hall on cam-
pus. We are now negotiating with
College over the position of evening
meals in Sherfield, which is looking
positive. The College is determined
to open the café/shop on the ground
floor of Linstead, which will now
serve breakfast and weekend meals
(currently unavailable in Princes
Gardens).
As previously reported in Felix,
the Linstead first floor area will
remain the private communal area
of the hall – consistent with all other
Imperial College halls. I have been
somewhat surprised to receive rep-
resentations from Southside aficio-
nados that a new bar could equally
have provided a social space for
the residents. This is simply not
true. Look around you. How many
students are there on the South
Kensington campus? Do they all
use the bars? Of course not – we
only have capacity for about 10% of
students.
There is a proportion of our stu-
dent population who do not like or
feel comfortable socialising in bars.
Moreover, most people don’t want to
spend every night in a bar for lack
of any other communal space. The
College needs to provide alternative
social provision, of which we cur-
rently have none in the evenings.
It also needs to be sensitive to the
needs of an increasingly cosmopoli-
tan student body, and telling stu-
dents in a hall of residence that
their only social space is a general
College bar just won’t cut it.
When friends from other universi-
ties visit, they often make the obser-
vation that Southside is more of a
‘traditional university bar’ than the
Union’s. When I ask them what they
mean, they talk of white, middle
class students, many of whom are
winter team sports players. The fact
is that in an ever-changing student
demographic it becomes increas-
ingly difficult to provide social space
that appeals to everyone.
That’s not to say that the Union
social facilities do much better –
hence the motivation behind creat-
ing a redevelopment masterplan for
Beit.
The Southside bar has a long and
cherished history and will be sorely
missed. The College does needs to
provide alternative social space,
as well as improve what is left.
However, it must be for the benefit
of today’s student body as a whole,
not yesterday’s.
