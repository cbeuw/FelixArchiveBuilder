Issue 1321 solution
Thanks to everyone who entered.
The winner is biology student
Katie Abranson.
Hello again! If you’ve got exams at the moment, or if you’ve
got them coming up soon, this puzzle will stave off the
tedium of revision for a while; if you’ve had your exams, or
if you’ve not got any this year at all, it will give you some-
thing to do with all that spare time, you lucky son of a bitch.
Not much to say about it, really, except that there are a few
clues here that I’m extremely proud of. I hope that little
toot on my own kazoo entices you to give the puzzle your
best shot. Good luck! Snufkin
