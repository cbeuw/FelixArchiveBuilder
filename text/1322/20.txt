Wye ladies win ULU Cup
ULU Cup Final
Wye Women’s 1st 17
LSE Women’s 1st 0
By Suzanne Horn
The Wye girls have been
anticipating this match for
months, and they weren’t
going to lose without a fight.
Eighty minutes was all it was
going to take to come away
with the cup. And what an 80
minutes it turned out to be.
Wye kicked off the match
and immediately put pres-
sure on LSE in the form of
an aggressive wall of maroon
and white shirts. The awe-
some attack from the Wye
girls prompted panic within
the attacking LSE line, forc-

and suffer many turnover
balls.
The first try came from a
blindside set piece move off

communication between the
half-backs and the amazing
strength of the pack.
Possession was difficult for
Wye to come by. LSE were

Wye’s performance. Annie’s
tackling was especiallystrik-

fabulous display on the pitch.
LSE came close to scor-
ing, taking the ball across our
try line but being unable to
ground it with Liz and Andrea
under the ball. This outstand-
ing defensive effort provoked
increased determination
in the forwards. A massive
tackle by Mary turned the
ball over. In a blink of an
eye, the ball was efficiently
passed down our back line
to the winger, Lucy, who ran
in between the sticks for our
second try of the game.
Towards the end of the first
half, Wye took charge and
dominated the game within
LSE’s 22 yard line. Hetty
was on fine form, streaming
through their defence at any
opportunity adding to Wye’s
dangerous attack, but unable
