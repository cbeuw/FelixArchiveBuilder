aged to battle down the rapid.
I wish we had got it on video.
It was at this point that we
were seriously running out
of time, so we decided to try
to walk out. Jim and I did a
scout up the hillside to find
the road. After much effort
and scratched legs, we found
it. We went back down for our
kit and we all headed back up.
Emerging onto the road, we
heard dodgy electronic tech-
no music coming from down
the road. A van with kayaks
came round the corner. It was
the Germans again! They
gave Jim a lift to the top and
the sense of relief could be
felt by all. It was eight o’clock.
We had taken eight and a half
hours to do four and a half
kilometres of water.
The evening consisted
of eating pizza in a nearby
town and then a long drive to
the put-in for the Tavignano,
where we were due to meet
up with some guys from the
Glaxo paddling club. We all
fell asleep, absolutely knack-
ered!
Tuesday 29 March –
Tavignano and disaster!
(by Jim)
The guys from Glaxo arrived
in the morning and after a
quick change we hopped into
our respective cars and drove
down to the bottom of the
river. We arrived at the take-
out and myself and a guy from
Glaxo got into the third car to
be driven back up to the top.
My memory of the events
that followed is somewhat
hazy. I can remember pulling
off and talking to the guy in
the seat in front. I can also
remember seeing a white van
hurtling towards us and both
cars skidding in the same
direction. The fraction of a
second before impact will
remain with me for the rest of
my life – knowing that you’re
about to hit and there’s sod
all you can do isn’t a particu-
larly nice feeling!
Fortunately, all three of
us got out of the wreckage
without much damage. The
French bloke we hit wasn’t so
fortunate. Whilst the Laguna
had excellent crumple zones,
seat belt tensioners and
front airbags, his little van
benefited from none of these.
Eventually the emergency
services arrived. Their prior-
ity was obviously the French
guy, but our driver was also
treated for a suspected bro-
ken foot and I had some seat-
belt cuts treated by the para-
medics. By this time there
were three police cars, three
different ambulances, a fire
crew and a helicopter.
The French bloke got air-
evacuated after being cut out
through the back of the van.
Our driver was also taken to
hospital. We were asked to
follow the gendarmes to their
station. We were interviewed
separately by a policewom-
an who spoke reasonable
English, and were also asked
to sign statements.
The others had a more
enjoyable day, according to
Chad:
“We started sombrely at the
Tavignano, given that there
had just been a car crash
that had put all but two of the
Glaxo group either in hospital
orthepolicestationalongwith
Jim. We decided to set off, as
we would have to wait four
to six hours anyway before
the police were finished. It
started relatively easily with
a few kilometres of flat water
paddling, the only feature of
note being a hydroelectric
dam that required portaging.
The only exit was through the
inlets, but presumably there
must be some kind of warn-
ing before they open them,
otherwise things could get
quite interesting!
“Then came the bit we were
all waiting for – the gorge sec-
tion. This was fun, however
due to my over-optimistic
interpretation of the temper-
ature I just wore a cag-deck
and shorts and since little
sunlight enters the gorge (at
one point it narrowed to less
than paddle width), it gets
cold. However, this had an
unusual benefit in that the
one time I did capsize, after
three roll attempts, it seemed
about time for my daily swim
but given the lack of insula-
tion on my nether regions I
remained in the boat and on
the sixth attempt I was in
calm enough water. However,
one of the Glaxo crew did
have a brief swim there after
no roll attempts.
“After2kmofthiswereached
the get-out and awaited the
return of a Laguna to trans-
port us back to Jim at the
police station. Whilst waiting,
we had a look at the road
markings at the accident site
to keep warm.”
The others turned up at the
station and got changed into
their dry things. Eventually
we all headed back to the
other guy’s gite. Once there
we made use of the cook-
ing facilities and hot show-
ers. When I removed my boot,
my foot was pretty black and
nicely swollen – a definite end
to my paddling on this trip.
Food was consumed in vast
portions and beers, whisky
and some strange local brew
were drunk. Eventually we
all settled down for a good
night’s kip, with me being
very glad to have survived
relatively unharmed.
Wednesday 30 March –
Lower Asco (by Chad)
After some tea and breakfast
at the gite, we parted compa-
ny with the Glaxo posse and
headed off to do a warm down
river. After a brief trip to find
a bakery, we found our way to
the Lower Asco. Jim followed
the progress from the road
above with the camera and
we set off in what must have
been the clearest river I’ve
ever paddled in.
It proved a rather leisurely
run with no horizons for me
to get out and inspect so, just
to show willing, I got out to
“inspect” the bottom of an
eddy. My initial fear was that
Jim had recorded this ultra-
lame swim but to my relief
he was round the corner.
Unfortunately Patrick did see
it (how did he get the camera
out so fast?)
We finished the river by
2pm, and so had plenty of
time to drive to Bastia and
polish out the scratches on
the car roof left by the rack.
After four hours of searching,
we found what we were look-
ing for and drove back toward
Bonifacio to await the ferry
the next day.
After fixing the car roof we
set up camp in a nice park
and chilled out on the beach
watching the sun go down
whilst reflecting on a day that
was in stark (and welcome)
contrast to the previous day’s
vehicular carnage.
Thursday 31 March/
Friday 1 April – the fools
fly home (by Jim)
We spent Thursday leisurely
waiting for the ferry and then
driving back across Sardinia.
That night we set up camp
right next to the airport, but
the sound of the planes didn’t
disturb us too much – we
were far too tired!
An early start saw us
returning the abused hire
car and checking into the
airport before flying back to
Stansted.
So that was the end of our
Corsican adventure – an
incredibly tiring, but very
enjoyable 9 days!
