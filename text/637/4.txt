Passing the Buck
' Dear Martin
In reply to Olivo Miotto's
letter (FELIX 636), I will now
give a short lesson in 'passing the
buck'. He, and others, may or
may not be aware that both the
faulty films he mentions (Psycho
and The Tin Drum) are distri-
buted by the same company:
R*nk Audio Visual Ltd. Need-
less to say, both faults were
present 'at source'. The first was
due to incorrect splicing leading
to the film being out of sync with
the shutter, and the second
having incorrect labelling on the
leader tapes.
Any other mistakes in the
showing of films will be due to
the projectors, which are the
concern of Film Soc. Therefore
by simple argument if anything
goes wrong, it is not my fault, I
only book the films and collect
the money.
Why not come to an Ents film
(ME220, 6:30pm, Thursdays)
and see how it should be done.
Yours sincerely

Dear Martin
Stephen Goulder has told
F E L I X that he would be in
favour of a system of student
loans en lieu of grants 'if one
could be devised that would
increase the number of working
class students at university'. Was
thfs just an attempt to be non-
cornmital, or does our Prole-
tarian President really believe
that an education mortgage of
three thousand pounds will
encourage low-income families
to send their o f f s p r i n g to
University?

Insulting
Correspondence
Dear Sir
In your last week's editorial
you accused me of sending you a
'rather insulting letter'. Having
since consulted various members
of y o u r staff, the general
consensus seems to be that you
were t a l k i n g through y o u r
backside.
Yours in anger

Dear Martin
In response to the Forward
which IC Liberals distributed
around College last week, we
have received a number of
queries about the £12 levy which
the College is imposing on
residents of College admini-
stered property; nominally a
payment for the services of the
Health Centre. We have in-
vestigated the ramifications/
legality of this scheme and have
discovered that those in head
tenancies had no mention of the
payment in their agreements
and, it appears, are entitled to a
refund. The scheme is supposed
to be compulsory for all those
students in halls of residence but
even this is doubtful in law. How
can students be forced to make a
c o m p u l s o r y payment for a
private health scheme?
This new payment of £12 has
been introduced because College
has withdrawn its financial
backing. We believe that regard-
less of any other argument it
should be (a) the choice of the
individual student whether s/he
opts into what amounts to a
private health scheme, and (b)
the responsibility of all students,
and c e r t a i n l y not the sole
responsibility of those occupying
the few halls of residence rooms
available, to finance a common
service. These however are
minor points compared with the
principle that College seems to
have adopted; that health
provision should be paid for by
the student body, especially in a
city in which N H S facilities are
so inadequate.
Yet again it seems that our
Union has let students down; it
has failed to explain what is
going on; it has allowed College
to save money at our expense
and colluded in a scheme which
could be illegal. We feel that all
those students who have been
obliged to pay the levy, espe-
cially those in hall who at
present have no option but to
pay, should get an immediate
refund: this compulsory scheme
should be withdrawn right away
• H r M M N M B M I February
and the College should fulfil its
responsibility to the whole
student body by financing an
essential service.

Dear Martin
I find in your letters column
yet another letter concerning the
Islamic Society poster crisis.
This crisis is so major that I
suspect that few of your readers
have ever heard of it.
I have yet to see any reason in
the constitution why the Execu-
tive action relating to the
Human Rights Fair display was
wrong. In this case, and in the
case of Mines Review, a petition
of twenty signatures was received
by the Union. Both cases were
investigated and the appropriate
action taken.
Mindless fanaticism will not
prevail at Imperial College.
Yours sincerely

Anti-Gravity
Dear Sir
We. the residents of 37
Hamlet Gardens, feel we can no
longer remain silent concerning
the abnormal terrestrial condi-
tions in. and around, our flat.
We refer specifically to the
ludicrous gravitational fluctu-
ations that occur here. The most
disturbing aspect of this pheno-
menon is the ridiculously high
force of gravity that exists in the
ante-meridian period. It is our
personal experience that on
some occasions the gravitational
forces have been so intense that
the victim had been rendered
helpless, pinned to his bed and
unable to rise. Only yesterday,
having crawled from his own
resting place, M r P Donnelly
found another resident, M r C
B o y d , flattened against his
mattress, his face contorted in
his struggle to overcome the
earths attraction.
As conscientious students who
strive to make the most of our
university years, we find it
particularly distressing that this
problem is beginning to have an
adverse effect on our attendance
records. We acknowledge that
Michael Arthur and his student
services are powerless in com-
batting this quirk of nature.
However, we feel that the lack
of research into this subject is
puzzling, especially since IC
has amongst its ranks a leading
world authority on localised
heavy gravity anomalies, Dr I
Grist. Dr Grist informs us 'these
18, 1983
phenomena are common, but
have in the past been wrongly
e x p l a i n e d away as due to
alcoholic overindulgence'.
To sum up our concern is
heightened by today's prolonged
'gravity surge' which has ex-
tended well into the post-
meridean period. If this state of
affairs remains unchanged we
will be forced to complete our
university courses from our
beds.
Yours prostrately

Pornography
or Art?
Sir
Life is curious—isn't it? For
instance last weekend I was
discussing with another student
a play written by a lesbian
academic with a cast composed
entirely of women. Mention was
made of a love scene in which
the heroine is seduced by a man
and the opinion was passed that
instead of merely hugging one
another the women involved
should have given a rather more
convincing performance—even
to the point of nudity and
beyond.
Strong stuff, eh? And yet the
person with whom I was having
the conversation was none other
than a member of the faculty of
politics at Sussex University—
and yes she was true to form, ie
she made WIST and the late-
I C W A look mild.
Strong, eh? When the Royal
School of Mines watches women
cavorting naked on stage, it's
pornography, and yet when the
trendy intellectuals of Sussex
watch it then it's art

Sir
I must protest in the strongest
possible manner at your ridi-
culous E T lookalike competition
in last week's F E L I X , in which I
feel that I have been particularly
shabbily insulted. Y o u have,
while thoughtlessly looking for a
little harmless fun, caused
i r r e p a r a b l e damage to one
whose reputation stretches far
beyond the boundaries of IC.
I demand an apology.
Yours
