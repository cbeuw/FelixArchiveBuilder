IC STUDENTS ON FIREARMS CHARGE
The Union Finance Committee's
decision to cut Constituent Col-
lege Union grants next year was
reversed at Monday's Council
meeting after several Union
officials attempted to block the
reversal by making the meeting
inquorate.
The original motion, pre-
sented to U F C last Friday, was
proposed by the Recreational
Clubs Committee and seconded
by Atheletics Clubs, Social
Clubs, Publications Board and
SCAB. It suggested that C C U
estimates for 1983/4 were
exaggerated and represented an
unrealistic position and thus
could justifiably be cut. Items to
undergo cuts included entertain-
ments and exec h o n o r a r i a .
According to the motion, the
ICU President was to ensure that
Major Sub-committee's de-
mands are met more readily thus
channelling money into IC
Union clubs rather than C C U
clubs.
This motion was passed by
U F C , where Major Subcom-
mittee representatives out-
number C C U representatives.
But at the U n i o n C o u n c i l
meeting on M o n d a y night,
President Stephen G o u l d e r
included an item on C C U
expenditure in his report, which
concluded that the CCUs' cash
limits would have to depend on a
priority determined by U F C .
At this point the meeting,
chaired by John Passmore,
became heated as the C C U
presidents presented an emer-
gency motion which would
reverse the U F C decision which
they described as "unrepresen-
tative and undemocratic". Due
to the strong presence of Depart-
No. 6 3 7 H H H H H
mental Representatives and
delegates, the M a j o r Sub-
committee officers estimated
that they would be defeated and
therefore attempted to close the
meeting before the vote. In order
to do so, Jonathan Miller, Ian
Bull, Mike Prosser and Matthew
Tonks, the SCC, A C C , Publica-
tions Board and SCAB Chair-
men respectively, walked out of
the meeting leaving John Mc-
Callion, I C U DP, to call quo-
rum. However, the challenge
was unsuccessful and an attempt
by a non-voting person to call
quorum after John McCallion
and Hugh Southey had left was
defeated by J o n Barnett's
oratory ability. The motion was
then passed by an overwhelming
majority in the absence of the
opposing officials.
Four students were arrested for
possession of a toy pistol in
Cumbria last Saturday. Carl
Fairhurst, Tony Collier and Julian
Barber, all undergraduates at
Imperial, and Martin White from
Cambridge have been released on
bail.
The four were on their way to
the Lake District for a weekend
of climbing. They had with them
a cap-pistol which one of the
four had been given for Christ-
mas, and when a lorry pulled out
in front of them on the M6, M r
Collier wound down the car
window and 'shot' the driver
on the way past. Some time
afterwards, they noticed a Police
Range Rover behind them, and
'shot' it through the back
window. The police car followed
them for some twenty miles, and
when they turned off the motor-
way they were intercepted by
more cars. In all, ten policemen
—two of them armed—and five
police cars were used.
The four students were
searched, the gun was confis-
cated and they were driven,
handcuffed, to Kendal Police
Station, about five miles distant.
There they had their shoes and
belts removed and were kept for
one and a half hours in a cell
while individual statements
were taken from all four. Their
fingerprints and photographs
were taken before they were
released on bail, although they
claim that they were never
formally charged—in fact, this
was the first indication that they
had been arrested. They were
told that the lorry driver had
reported a shooting incident,
and that because the students
had been stopped by Lancashire
Police they could not be charged
at Kendal, which is in Cumbria.
They are expected to attend
Lancaster Police Station on
March 12, where formal charges
may be made—probably for
Breach of the Peace, according
to a police spokesman. He said
that th" charges would not be
seriou„, out that it was 'a stupid
thing to do in this day and age'.
