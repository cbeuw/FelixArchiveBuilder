OPINION
More interested in booze, porn and
academic work than South Africa?
You could be neglecting your
responsibilities to mankind. Socialist
Society Chairperson Mike Mallick
warns of the dangers of political
ignorance.
When you leave (his College the
chances are yon will work lor
military defence (directly or
indirectly) or for a company
involved in South Africa (again
it may he directly or indirectly).
As scientists we show few
emotions; we are cold, insensi-
tive and ruthless.

Changes are Needed
South Africa may be a country a
long way away, but what hap-
pens there does affect us a lot in
this country. Our continued
support for the apartheid regime
reflects the racial tensions here,
our attitude towards life and
Dangers of Work?
Some of us have had just about
enough of this College. Most of
the students here seem more
interested in porn, drink and for
many exclusively their academic
course than what their responsi-
bility to this World is. Surely
you realise you have a duty to
care for the present and future of
mankind—to make the world a
better place to live in.
The dangers of porn and drink
have all too clearly been pointed
out in previous issues of F E L I X .
But work, especially scientific,
can fall into this category if no
other interests are involved. The
m a i n r e a s o n y o u come to
university is to study your
courses, granted, but you also
have a unique opportunity to
broaden your minds in other
areas. Many of you come here
and spend three years working
solidly with the expectation of
going into a highly paid job
without considering the implica-
tions to society. Someone at the
last U G M said that it should not
be for the College to meddle
with politics—the answer I have
come to expect to hear at this
College. Unfortunately, the lives
of people have all too often been
put in jeopardy by the apathy
of scientists to politics, and
politicians to science. What is
more it seems as though you
wish to remain naive so that you
will have no qualms about your
conscience dictating your life.
Mike Mallick
other people, and our own self-
interest at this present time. It
can only be for the present time
as the political climate in South
Africa is hardly stable with
threats of terrorist action which
will not ruin just their own
economy but ours and any other
country with interests there. It is
far better that we convince the
South African Government their
system is wrong: that it is
undemocratic and unrepre-
sentative, and make the changes
through legislation, rather than
through violence. The only way
this can be achieved is by
showing we do not support them
whether that be financially or
whatever.
So far we have looked at the
matter from a self-interest point
of view but what about other
people. Imagine you are a black
in South Africa. You are re-
quired to have a pass which you
must carry around with you at
all times; you may be expected to
produce it at any time whether
you are in the street or asleep at
home one night; you can be
searched for no reason; you do
not have the right to marry
anyone you wish; if you wish to
work in a white town you must
be male and often be preapred to
separated from your family
for years, and then you must
find work within 72 hours; even
if a white man is subordinate to
you in qualifications at work
you will earn between six to
twelve times less than him.
Would you like to lead this sort
of life under a racist regime?
