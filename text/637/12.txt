•case you would be very wrong. The problem
which Terry and Cheryl have is that of bringing
up a family. Despite Cheryl's wish to have a
baby the couple lack the level of responsibility
necessary for parenthood. Still I am revealing
little about the play. The important points are
that I consider this work to be excellent and
yet it is horrific. I strongly recommend the play
but don't think you'll enjoy it. These are not
contradictions. Care is not comfortable
theatre.
Peter Hugo-Daly and Gwyneth Strong
performed brilliantly. As Roy Mitchell's first
full-length stage play this is piece worthy of a
theatre award. Don't take my word for it. Go
down to Sloane Square for this world premiere
and judge for yourself. Tickets are cheaper on
Monday (£2) than weekdays (£3) or weekend
(£3.50).

The follow-up to last week's romantic evening
meal 'is a romantic champagne breakfast for
two". The night before this meal is to take
place, make chip salad as follows. Fry enough
chips sor two. Drain and divide between two
plates. Pour a generous helping of mint sauce
over each helping. Cover thickly with grated
cheese and grill until it melts down between

1 Pelham Street, SW7
589 3511
Open 9am every day. Last orders 11:45pm
(Mon to Sat) and 11:30pm (Sun).
Apart from its proximity to College (just round
the corner from the entrance to South
Kensington tube), this place does not have
much to recommend it.
The decor is as tasteless as the food and
the chips. Scatter a few caraway seeds on top
of the cheese. Chill in fridge overnight.
The next morning, make sausage eclairs.
You will need long frankfurther rolls, a gill of
sour cream, a tin of anchovies and the
sausages of your choice. While the sausages
are frying, mash the anchovies thoroughly and
stir into the sour cream. Slit open the rolls,
drop a sausage into each and then pipe the
cream over the sausages in a zigzag.
Serve these two delicacies with Buck's Fizz
Egg-nog. Put four raw eggs, measure of
brandy, half a pint of fresh orange juice and a
half a pint of champagne (or equivalent) into
a blender and blend thoroughly. Serve in long
glasses, garnished with black olives.
To finish off, serve black coffee with slices of
toast and marmalade fried in batter.
although it is clean and the service is
reasonable the atmosphere is purely
functional.
Most of the menu is not expensive but then
neither is it good value for money. For
example, the starters vary from 30p to £1.35
but although Prawn Cocktail at £1.10 was
adjudged good with lots of prawns, the
Avocado with Prawns was remarkably free of
flavour.
Of the pastas, Spaghetti alia Carbonara
(£1.70) which purported to be spaghetti with a
sauce of bacon, cream and eggs, looked the
most appetising. It turned out to be greasy
spaghetti with bacon scraps. Now it may well
be that Spaghetti alia Carbonara is meant to
turn out as greasy spaghetti with bacon scraps
but this observation is no consolation
whatsoever to the hapless diner who may feel
that grease and bacon scraps is a far cry from
a sauce of bacon, cream and eggs.
Cordon Bleugh must have had a hand in this
menu. Curried scampi with rice (£3.95) for
example seems to cry out for a large dollop ot
raspberry and guava marmalade.
Main courses range from £1.70 to £4.70.
Maybe the more expensive dishes represent
the epitome of culinary excellence, but I doubt
it and who wants to spend £4 70 in a dump like
this anyway.
The Fegato alia Veneziana (£2.40) was
described as lambs liver fried in butter with
onions and parsley, which may well have been
what it was—I was far too overwhelmed by the
awfulness of the accompanying anaemic peas
to notice.
The puddings were better. A good sized bit
of gateau for 75p was best buy.
The bill for two with half a litre of wine came
to £10.25 plus tip, but it was hardly money well
spent.

On Monday February 7, IC beat
London Hospital 4-1. The score
should have been about 10-0,
but Python, Richard and Jim
were'still recovering from ULU's
polo tour to Paris that weekend,
and from the traumas of spend-
ing the nights in various com-
binations with Mary and Fran
(tic Lay).
Tuesday night saw us getting
things together a bit better when
we beat St Thomas' Hospital 6-2
although John didn't help much
by trying to bounce the ball off
the ceiling on his first shot. Paul
got two brilliant goals.
On Thursday morning, Martin
remembered that his passes at \
ULU's bisexual lingratory had
come to no avail (Fran didn't
like snakes) on Saturday night,
and promptly got a severe dose
of thfe shits which meant that we
were w i t h o u t our r e p t i l i a n
goalkeeper for Friday's friendly
j against Woodside. Consequently
we thrashed them by an un-
rememberable amount, with
everyone getting lots of goals
except Paul and Martin who
weren't there.
We've got another dozen or so
matches between now and the
end of term, so if Richard
(Rogers) and Stuart's girlfriends
can do without them for an hour
or two, it would be nice to see
them at training again sometime.

Thirds
IC vs BA
IC Thirds took off in great style
with four quick goals in the first
half. Three of them came from
Charles Eldridge who spent
most of the match trying to
rearrange the features on the
opposition's faces. After several
near misses Paul D u b e m s k i
scored (a goal). We were brought
down to earth again in the
second half as the ref reckoned
the ball went past Tim Stocking
(goalie) twice...the audacity of
the bloke.
Just to rub in our crushing
victory, Dave Morris (defender)
smuggled the ball past seven B A
personnel but he got caught in
a net. What twit left that there?
Which all goes to prove that
B A really lived up t» their nan:..
members may only play other
members during club court time.
Germany: Dates (April 6-13
incl) and barracks accommoda-
tion are both confirmed. Max no

members of any playing stan-
dard are invited.

Annual Dinner!
Apologies to Thirds re non-
appearance of U C H Seconds.
Tonight is the Camborne squash
match for which a capacity
c r o w d is a n t i c i p a t e d . Next
Sunday R S M go to Nottingham
for a sporting tournament and
five squash players are included.
Then on March 5 and 6 IC 1/2
go to Oxford to take on Oxford
University Seconds ('Squirrels')
plus Oriel College, St John's and
St Edmunds. This in fact will be
the club's first venture outside
London for several years.

The sailing team trave1
' d down
to the Hamble River to take on
Southampton University last
Saturday. In the first race
Graham and Graham got off to
a good start but were quickly
overtaken by two Southampton
boats; the rest of the team were
sailing even slower. Dave and
Kate were occasionally seen to
be going sideways faster than
they were going forwards. In the
second race Phil and Richard
capsized to leave Southampton
with an easy win. Thanks must
go to Jack for his much appre-
ciated body heat.
