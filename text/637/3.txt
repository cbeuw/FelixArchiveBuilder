No Report
for Weeks
The College's long awaited
residence report will come too
late to have any influence on this
year's accommodation policy,
according to Union President
Stephen Goulder. It cannot, he
said, be seen by both Residence
and House Committees in time
for its recommendations to be
carefully considered.
The seventy-five page report
was commissioned by College
Secretary John Smith last year,
and was to have been ready for
the beginning of this term. But
John Lauwerys was unable to
produce the report in time, and
although the first draft has been
seen it is not yet ready for
p r i n t i n g . This means that
important decisions based on the
report's recommendations may
not be made until the summer
vacation, and so if, as expected
Weeks Hall is to become purely
for the use of postgraduates, it
may have to wait until next year.
Mr Smith explained to F E L I X
that he had commissioned the
report because decisions over the
past year have been made with
no firm policy in mind, leading
to anomalies in the system. But
he did not feel that the timing of
the report was critical, as in his
o p i n i o n House C o m m i t t e e
would not be considering it—it
was just the concern of Resi-
dence Committee.
The report is expected to
suggest changes in the head
tenancy system—when property
prices rise, landlords may sell
their properties. As the College
is committing itself to housing
all first year students, a more
permanent agreement with the
owners of the Fiemantle and
Sovereign Hotels may be neces-
sary.
The traditional British Lion looks on with interest as IC Chinese Society perform a lion dance on the
Queens Lawn. Last Friday was the eve of the year of the pig, and despite the inclement weather and a
late start, the dancers were well pleased with the result.
Dancing
Success
T w o teams from I m p e r i a l
College Ballroom Dancing Club
came third after University
College London and Oxford
University in the St Ives compe-
tition last Saturday. This should
stand them in good stead for the
national inter-varsity compe-
tition on March 4.
The entire first team, well
supported by a good turnout of
spectators, reached the finals,
with the quickstep and chacha
couples coming second, the
waltz third and jive fifth. On
their way the team defeated
teams from Cambridge, Bristol,
Birmingham and Southampton.

Mailing
The cost of mailing copies of the
Imperial College Union Alterna-
tive Prospectus will not be met
by College this year. Instead, the
Union will have to find about
£1,500 to send copies to 9,000
schools in Britain and abroad.
Last year, the A P was sent out
with the College's Official
Prospectus at the College's
expense, but this year the official
publication will be printed in a
less extravagant form in Bristol,
and from there it will be sent
direct to the schools on the
FELIX m m m m m m m m m
U C C A list. As arrangements
have already made to have
the A P printed in London, it
seems that the Union will have
to pay this year's postage from
its own pocket, as well as
employing collators to put the
books in envelopes and address
them. Hugh Southey, this year's
Alternative Prospectus Editor, is
looking into several schemes to
save money by sending the APs
out w publk -tions from other
colleges. He stressed the impor-
tance of the A P in presenting a
critical students' eye view of
Imperial and pointing out faults
which official prospectuses tend
to gloss over.
Mascots: 'Mines is Ours'
The Royal College of Science Union has re-captured Davey, the
RSMU's violate mascot. On Tuesday several members of the RCSU
found Davey in a pink bin liner behind the Messenger's desk in the
Royal School of Mines. It is two years since the RCSU last captured
Davey, and RCSU officials have refused to name their members
involved in the abduction for fear of reprisals from the Miners.
