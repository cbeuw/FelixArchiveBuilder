Here's another extremely lengthy
report to exclude Chess Club.
(This report does constitute a
challenge to Chess Club at any
neutral 'sport' they care to
mention.)
D Demento and the Motor-
bike K i d spilt the first blood
although Dominic was inspired
by a certain Miss E. Zombie
Steve and Huf Chrisslet made a
sparkling return.
Anyway, Honest John and
Steve Ching rubbed in IC's
superiority whilst at the back of
their minds they could not
believe 'Scotty's' account of the
pub crawl.
As u s u a l T o n y d r o p p e d
himself to help things along—
he did get some nice biscuits
though!
Well that just about sums it
up. See you at the Reading Jaffa
Cake Festival and bring your
own blow up Llama.

Christian Union Meeting This
week's meeting promises to be
very interesting for Christians
and non-Christians alike. They
will be attempting to find out
how it feels to be part of the
Third World, and what better
way than to play a game!—
Intrigued? Then go along and
find out!

IC vs LSE 9-0
As we had already won our
league by a mile, we decided to
play them at chess instead:
W B
P-K4 P-K3
Q-KN5 P-KN3
QxPch
We then read 'War and Peace'
three times whilst LSE thought.
B-K2
QxR Resigns, gets
pissed
The 'Scott Ooening' combined
with i n e 'swahili bulldozer
defence' never fails! After our
hard physical exertions we all
retired for a steaming hot cup of
Horlicks and mummy let us all
stay up especially late to watch
'Magic Roundabout'.
No, I was only kidding. (Had
you all fooled, didn't I?) We did
play them at badminton. Several
team members were A W O L and
some A W L , so we tried out
some prospective team members
for next year. The team missed
my creative genius (joke!),
Martin's ebullience, and Nick's
tactical a b i l i t y . The team,
however, still trampled all over

LSE, clearly demonstrating our

Thirds are now unbeaten since
October 1981. Who can stop us?!
Thanks to Jane for dancing on
the table in the Cromwellian the
other week. Now, what the club
needs is a full-scale, drink to the
death, pub-crawl. This shall
come to pass on Friday March
4 in the Royal Borough of
Kensington. Meet Southside.
The rabble will leave at 7:30pm
precisely. Guaranteed Watneys-

IC vs QEC 4-0
Although we were playing in a
covered walkway come dining
room, we managed to ignore the
thundering masses and nauseous
aroma of lunch and win in our
usual splendiforous style! The
opposing team took desperate
measures in the final game to
steal a win over Andree and
Janet by trying to 'lose' all the
shuttlecocks by means of hitting
them onto the balcony over-
hang. But our two heroines
persevered and won the game
even though there was a distinct
lack of feathers on the last
shuttlecock.

Ardent readers of this column
are no doubt on the verge of
suicidal depression, after reading
of defeat after defeat. W e l l
there's no need to leave the
Queen's Tower the quick w: y,
you can use the stairs, because
we actually won a match. Yes!!
Southampton 2, Imperial 8.
Don't cheer too loud, you'll
wake the lecturer. This victory
was achieved without the great
Dave Gee. Dave had cut his
finger-nails the night before and
so didn't feel up to the rigours of
bowling. Superb performances
by Kevin Short, Helen Bonker
(sorry, Bowker) and Sarah Best
compensated for the loss of Mr
Gee and inspired the geriatrics
section (of Chris Wells, Ray
Cook and Brian MacGowan—
contact via Chem Eng letter-
racks) to get out of their
wheelchairs and turn in match
winning performances.
