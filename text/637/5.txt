Exec Torture
One of the least savoury aspects
of Rag Week is Exec Torture.
For those of you new to this
quaint ritual, on the Tuesday of
Rag Week the U n i o n Exec
(technically Messrs Goulder,
McCallion, Grimshaw, Schmidt,
Walls and Bishop, but others
generally get coopted) gather in
Beit Quad and passers-by are
invited to contribute to Rag
funds f o r the privilege o f
watching the Exec get covered in
'the mix' which is a mixture
whose main constituents are
fresh blood and contaminated
offal.
As entertainment it rivals pig-
sticking and bear-baiting, being
little more than delight in
deliberate cruelty. As a means of
ra^!..g money it is ineffective:
John McCallion, formerly Rag
Treasurer, has said that the
money raised barely covers the
cost of the entrails. As a means
of becoming infected it is second
to none.
T h i s last p o i n t is often
(deliberately) ignored. It was not
widely reported, for instance,
when last year's RCS President
was very ill as a direct result of
Exec Torture. I sent a reporter
along to chat with Dr McManus
of Life Sciences, an authority on
parasitology, and some of the
diseases he described are, to put
it mildly, unpleasant.
For starters there's tubercu-
losis and hepatitis, particularly if
the victim has any sort of cut,
scratch or spot on their skin. The
tapeworm Taenia sagginata is
often found in cow offal, and
would have no hesitation in
embedding itself into a human
intestine. But the most specta-
cular by far is Echinococcus.
granulosus, found in sheep and
horse offal. The larva of this bug
enters the human body via the
eyelid. It then travels round to
the back of the eye where it
encysts, forming a fluid filled
bag which has the potential of
growing as big as a football. This
cyst contains thousands of other
larvae each capable of producing
another cyst. There is no chemical
therapy for this parasite-it can
only be removed by surgery.
Normally there is no possibi-
lity of parasites, since offal (and,
indeed, all meat) has to meet a
strict standard before it is passed
for human consumption. But the
offal used in Exec Torture is
available cheaply because it has
not passed the test.
Does the message need to be
spelt out further? If this ritual of
raising money by deliberately
humiliating members of the Exec
through mob rule and mass
hysteria is to continue (and
knowing the mentality of most
IC students, it will) at least

restrict it to ingredients which
won't do any permanent damage.
FELIX Staff
The position on the staff which
is currently vacant is that of
book reviewer; I've received all
kinds o f different books to
review, ranging from romantic
novels to thrillers to travel
guides; anyone interested in
reading any or all of these and
writing about them afterwards,
please see me in the F E L I X
Office. You get to keep the book
afterwards!
Next week is Rag Week with a
thousand and one different
events in and around IC—far
too m a n y f o r o u r r e g u l a r
photographers to cover. So if
you've ever had an inclination
towards photo-journalism, turn
up at the F E L I X Office at
12:45pm today, or see me any
time.
Finally, I have been feeling
lately that F E L I X is a bit thin on
humour; I don't want to decry
the regular humour features we
do publish, but if there are any
aspiring Alan Corens out there
who can write a regular satirical
column, I'd be only too happy to
hear from you.
Elections
Herewith the F E L I X Editor's
arbitrary and dictatorial rules
for p r i n t i n g o f s a b b a t i c a l
election publicity.
Manifestos will appear in
F E L I X on Friday March 4.
They will be limited to three
hundred words and may be
accompanied by a black and
white photograph or drawing.
They must be presented to me by
1:00pm on Monday February
28.
Anyone wishing to prepare
artwork may use F E L I X facili-
ties from Friday to Monday (of
any week) but must get my
permission first. Artwork ready
for printing by Tuesday morning
will be done by the following
Friday.
Publicity for other elections
can be printed in the F E L I X
Office (subject to the same
deadlines) but there is no room
to allow preparation of artwork
except dot-screening photo-
graphs.
Bits and Pieces
Hay Fever sufferers can earn £5
for half an hour's form filling in
the Health Centre: turn up there
at 1:15pm on Tuesday.
Sketchley's, the cleaners, have
asked me to tell you they are
testing a student d i s c o u n t
scheme; present your Unioncard

when collecting it) before the
Sales Assistant has rung the
order into the till and you will be
allowed a 15% discbunt. The
offer is open until March 31 at
their branches at 28/30 Glouces-
ter Road and at 99 Gloucester
Road.

TO T H E C A S U A L OBSERVER
the political wranglings within
STOIC may seem intense but
according to next year's secre-
tary Dunal Quigley all the
committee p-osto '.vcre settled ac:
long ago as last Christmas some
two months before papers even
went-up.
If true, these allegations may
explain certain discrepancies in
the electoral procedure as
interpreted by returning officer
Lawrence Windley. The consti-
tution clearly states that only
two seconders are needed for
each candidate whereas M r
Windley has stipulated three, in
an effort, it is said, to discourage
opposition to his chosen candi-
dates.
One of the most interesting
things is that the constitution
was written in March 1982 under
the chairmanship of M r Windley
himself. What is his modve for
ignoring his own rules?
W h i l e o n the subject o f
STOIC, I can reveal the signifi-
BELOW
cances of vaiious references in
the Small Ads and elsewhere to
the STOIC toad.
Back in the dark days of 1970
S i w I C was formed by Sinclair
Goodlad who has since fallen
out of favour. However moves
have been made recently to ask
D r G o o d l a d to be S T O I C
President.
Now STOIC have just had a
drastic reduction in studio time
making it difficult to complete
their usual programmes. D o
STOIC want to get their hands
on D r G o o d l a d ' s Elec E n g
Studio? O r is it a plot i n
collusion with the Studio Mana-
ger Colin Grimshaw to incor-
porate the Elec Eng Studio into
the IC T V Studio empire?
College has recently refused to
give the Elec Eng Studio to M r
Grimshaw as they say he doesn't
need it.
It makes Dallas look realistic.

IT'S P R O B A B L Y B E C A U S E it
was re-formed by a former
F E L I X Editor, but the H G
W e l l s S o c i e t y has a l w a y s
attracted more than its share of
U n i o n hacks. Witness last
Wednesday's formal dinner
attended by Messrs Goulder,
McCallion, Grimwash, Schmidt,
Rodan...Not content with over-
whelming the occasion by sheer
force of numbers, they insisted
on monopolising the conversa-
tion topics all evening, which
resulted in dreadful tedium to
those uninterested in who will
stand for which election next
week.
Eventually it became t o o
much for the Chairman Mike
MacClancy, who had hecome
increasingly irritated by Stephen
Goulder (who was only one of
the guests) trying to organise the
f u n c t i o n , a n d by assorted
politicos each trying to outguess
the others' prediction for next
year's sabbaticals. So during his
speech, Mike mentioned that he
was going to stand for a sabba-
tica l post. A p p a r e n t l y the
resulting confusion at the bar
afterwards was most gratifying.
A N U M B E R O F Y O U felt (see
Letters, page 4) that we had not
done E T justice in printing a
picture of such a-youthful Henry
Sawistowski. So to make amends
here is a more recent picture
which, we feel, portrays the
similarity more vividly.
