Did you know that:
Since 1978/9 average earnings
have risen by 57%; the Retail
Price index has risen by 50%;
student grants have risen by only
39%.
Most people who have been
'ordinarily resident' in the U K
for three years prior to the
commencement of their course
are entitled to a mandatory
award for a first degree course.
This means the relevant Local
Education Authority will pay
the student's tuition fees and
make a contribution towards
their maintenance. How much
they pay depends on a number
of factors, the most important
being:
Parental Contribution
Unless you are over 25 or have
worked for at least three years,
your grant will be assessed on
your parents' i n c o m e . F o r
1982/3 the starting point for
parental contributions remains
at £ 6 , 6 0 0 leaving the vast
majority of students reliant on
their parents to make up their
grants. Although it is virtually
impossible to avoid having your
grant assessed on your parents'
income, there is no way that you
can force them to pay their
contribution if they refuse.
THE GRANT GAME
Minimum Grant
The minimum grant for 1982/3
remains at £410. This is the
amount you will receive if:
a) your parents' combined
income exceeds £21,000 (approx).
b) your parents refuse to sign
the grant forms.
c) your parents' income for
the relevant year cannot at
present be confirmed, eg if
they're abroad or self-employed.
Basic Rates of Grants
Most of you probably realise
that the basic full grant for
undergraduates studying in
London for 1982/3 is £1,900 but
do you know what that figure is
supposed to cover?

Vacation Element
The student grant includes ;in
element to cover eight weeks
vacation at C h r i s t m a s and
Easter. For 1982/3 this amounts
to £23.62 a week which is slightly
more than the single person's
rate of supplementary benefit.
This is why students arc not
eligible to claim supplementary
benefit during the short vaca-
tions. However, because there is
no element for rent included in
the grant for the vacations,
students can claim their rent
back from the DHSS but only if
they're living at the address for
which they're claiming. For
DHSS purposes your income in
the short vacations, will be
calculated as £23.62 irrespective
of whether your parents pay
their contribution.
Travel
The grant includes £50 for your
'travel costs. Any travelling costs
necessarily incurred above that
amount should be claimed back
from your L o c a l Education
Authority on an excess travel
form. Theoretically, you can
claim for d a i l y travel into
C o l l e g e p l u s three r e t u r n
journeys to your parental home
per year by the cheapest means
of travel. This usually means
buying a student railcard in
which case you can claim the
cost of that back too. However,
in practice, authorities only have
to pay what they consider to bke
'reasonable' and many authori-
ties do set conditions such as
reimbursement ceilings. The
Student Services Office may be
able to give you some guidelines
to the particular conditions set
by your authority but it is
essential that you check with
your authority before running up
a huge trave bill.
In addition to the above there
are a number of extra allowances
which the authority may award
eg extra money for dependents,
mature students, or vacations.
The Student Services Office has
details of these and a list of
addresses and telephone num-
bers of education authorities. If
you have any queries or diffi-
culties with your grant then call
into the Student Services Office
and we should be able to help.
