A b o r t i o n i n Ireland
This week was 'Week of Action' in
Ireland for freedom of information and
women's right to abortion. Imperial
College Union has been asked to set up a
solidarity campaign with the Irish
universities and colleges in their fight
against this issue.
Ireland is the only EC country where it
is illegal for a person to 'perform, attempt
or assist in an abortion'. In Ireland
abortion is still an offence punishable by
'penal servitude for life'. A n d now, since
1985, it is illegal even to give information
on abortion.
However, the student unions in Ireland
have continued to openly give
information about abortion in England for
Irish women. In 1988 4,000 w o m e n
registered with British abortion clinics as
Irish nationals but it is believed that the
same number again refused to reveal
their Irish addresses. A t present, student
unions in Ireland believe that there is a
need to provide abortion information but
they are facing increasing pressure from
all sides.
In 1988 S P U C (The Society for the
Protection of the Unborn Child) took legal
action against the four elected student
union officers of University College
Dublin. SPUC got an injunction
preventing them from giving information
about abortion in England. T h e university
officers also became liable for nearly
£50,000 court costs and, since under Irish
law, student unions have no legal status
the officers are personally liable for this
money. In 1989 the same thing happened
when SPUC took fourteen new student
leaders to court and as a result they are
again personally liable for further costs of
£22,000.
If you believe that the Irish student
unions should be helped and supported
by British student unions in their efforts
to provide abortion information then you
can personally support the campaign by
going to a fundraising benefit gig
organised by LSE on Wednesday
December 5. Posters will be up around
College at a later stage. Also, if you have
any ideas on how Imperial College Union
can become personally motivated in this
campaign please contact the Union Office
with your ideas.
