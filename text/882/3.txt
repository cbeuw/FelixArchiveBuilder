Print Unit Sell Off
Cuts to the College Print Unit will leave it
with only two rooms and a reduced set of
equipment. The lost space will be filled
by Continuing Education, a section which
runs outside courses to raise money for
Imperial.
The move of Continuing Education from
level three of Sherfield leaves space for
an International Office and a Schools
Liaison Office. These offices are designed
to increase the student intake into
Imperial.
The equipment lost from the Print Unit,
except for an offset printing press that

G r a n d Larceny Continues
Imperial College Security Officer Terry
Briley has asked college members to
'show a little responsibility in shutting
doors and using locks' following the
recent spate of thefts.
A thief stole articles including a
personal stereo from the Union G y m area
this week, three bicycles were stolen, and
a car was broken into at the rear of the
Chemistry building. A microwave has
been stolen from Fisher hall, following
the theft last week of a video recorder.
Mr Briley said that as the hall had a good
key system the thief or thieves 'could be
one of our own'.
'Unsocial behaviour' on the part of a
number of individuals caused some toilets
in the Mechanical Engineering building to
be covered in excrement. Mr Briley said
that this could be considered to be
criminal damage.
He added that the theft of the Union
Building sign from the front of Beit A r c h
had been noted and that the culprit was
'probably too embarassed' to rectify the
theft.
