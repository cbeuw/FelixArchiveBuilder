Mountain bike enthusiasts Colin and Liz discover the delights
Lake District Bik
Mountain biking is an activity fast
growing in popularity in this country.
Certainly a quick survey of bikes chained
up around IC will show that increasing
numbers of people are rejecting thin slick
tyres and drop handlebars in favour of
chunky tyres, straight handlebars and
numerous gears—the hallmarks of a M T B .
But how many of these city dwellers
actually jump on their mountain machines
and head for the high hills for some real
off-the-road terrain?
Colin and I decided to do just that.
Colin was already a keen mountain biker
with quite a bit of off-road experience as
well as being an experienced walker and
climber. I, on the other hand, a m (or was)
a complete novice w h o hadn't ridden a
bike for years a n d I a m also incredibly
unfit. Gullibility is another of m y traits,
and with only a little a r m twisting 1 was
persuaded to purchase m y very o w n M T B
and to spend ten days pushing it up hills
in the Lake District.
Despite being only a very recent
addition to the vast range of outdoor
activities, mountain biking's rise in
popularity has been very noticeable a n d
it has earned as many enemies as it has
fans. Because of this, restrictions have
quickly been introduced, only allowing
mountain bikes on roads and bridleways
(which prevents them from being used on
some of the best off-road terrain and
from reaching a lot of peaks). These
restrictions include open land as well as
footpaths as w e discovered on a one in a
million meeting with a National Park
ranger close to the top of Kinder Scot on
our practice weekend in the Peak District.
Because bridleways are few and far
between, and vary considerably in
condition with an uncanny habit of
ending in the middle of nowhere, w e
purchased The Mountain Bike Guide—by
Jeremy Ashcroft which was to become
our Bible during our holiday. This handy
little book describes routes a n d rates
them according to their difficulty (very
similar to climbing guides).
From this w e selected five routes
ranging from easy to difficult, all fairly
close to Hawkeshead, w h i c h we made our
base.
It was raining when w e set off from our
respective homes on the first morning
with our heavily overloaded bikes; it had
stopped raining when w e arrived, by
some freak of nature, on the same train
and almost on time. A l l was well. Colin
said that it was only four miles to
Hawkeshead if w e went across the lake
on the ferry, an ugly cable-driven
platform that trundles to a n d fro across
Lake Windermere all day. It was more
like seven miles, and the hill up to Far
Sawrey nearly killed me. It started to rain
again: all was not so well. O n arriving in
Hawkeshead w e pitched our tent and
went to check the next day's weather
forecast—rain.
Our enthusiasm was unabated and the
next morning w e set off o n our first ride:
Claife Heights, the small hill which
separates the valley containing
Hawkeshead and Esthwaite Water from
Windermere. This was the easy route,
however the bridleway w e chose to get
onto the route was anything but. A
humungous log-towing machine had been
through and churned up the steep and
uneven track, leaving huge puddles of
that wonderful substance w h i c h attracts
mountain bikers like flies to a
cowpat—MUD.
If we were keen, full blooded fearless
MTB'ers we w o u l d have ploughed on
through and got completely plastered
with the stuff, but w e weren't; w e got off
and walked round. W h e n w e d i d reach
the proper route, easy seemed too hard a
description—a smooth wide forest track
which meant a very fast downhill run to
the shores of Lake Windermere where w e
stopped for lunch and laughed at the
people trying to waterski. T h e n w e were
off along the side of the lake to the road
from the ferry and up the hill (which
nearly killed me the previous day) to Far
Sawry. There w e continued onto a
bridleway w h i c h led up to open land on
the top of the hill where it became quite
rocky which made the riding more
challenging.
To be successful at off-road cycling
several techniques are needed to
overcome obstacles such as large stones,
logs, holes and ruts, while still going
forward. Quite a mean feat when your
legs feel like jelly, you're gasping for
breath and sweat is pouring off every
square inch of your body. A l l it took was
one extremely fit looking w o m a n on the
same model of bike as me to go
hammering past at top speed to totally
of mud, mist and more.
ers
destroy m y confidence. Nevertheless w e
finished the route in two hours (only half
an hour more than the book said) and it
was back to the camp site for a Pasta
Choice and an evening drying out in the
pub.
The next day w e moved up a grade to
a moderate ride in Grizedale forest. This
is an area popular with hire bikers as
there are clearly marked cycle routes
along smooth forest tracks. O u r route,
however, avoided these a n d went along a
less-than-smooth bridleway w h i c h took us
out of the forest, across the top of the hill
and down to Coniston Water.
Today's speciality as far as the weather
was concerned was wind, very strong
wind. A l l attempts to ride along the
grassy track on the top ended with bike
and rider sprawled on the ground.
Despite being our longest actual route it
was fairly fast due to an eight mile blast
along the road beside the lake before a
steep boggy bridleway back up through
the forest and then back d o w n the road
to Hawkeshead.
The next day the weather took a
definite turn for the worse: it rained
heavily. So w e stayed in our little tent
only venturing out to visit the Beatrix
Potter gallery a n d to cook our Vesta
Sweet and Sour chicken. Y u m m y .
Now that our aching muscles had been
rested for a d a y w e were bright and
breezy, ready 'for an eight a n d a half mile
ride to the start of our route, this being
the Garburn Pass over the other side of
Windermere to Hawkeshead. This
month's issue of MBUK describes the
Garburn Pass as totally rideable if you're
good. W e weren't good enough a n d a fair
bit of pushing was required up the pass
which was quite steep and rocky. T h e
rest of the route was rideable if
somewhat boggy. W e were still full of life
when w e started on the eight and a half
miles back to the campsite. W e w « r e
totally dead when w e got there; twenty-
five miles had definitely taken their toll,
but w e were soon down at the pub
planning the next day's adventure.
This was the W a l n a Scar Road (short
version), and it provided us with our first
encounter with 'real' mountainbikers. Six
of them appeared from nowhere as w e
were pushing our bikes ungracefully over
some rocks. Within seconds they were
upon us all rippling muscles, expensive
bikes and shades. 'Team Lemming' they
were called, a n d with a brief hello as
they passed they vanished over the
horizon leaving us feeling a mite
inadequate.
The next two days were uneventful
because one was Sunday which is, as
everyone knows, a day of rest, so w e
only did ten miles—to a n d from
Ambleside for lunch. O n the other day
my brakes failed, so w e h a d to cycle to
Windermere to the nearest bike shop to
get a replacement. After that we made an
abortive attempt to re-do Claife Heights
but the rain poured down and half-way
round w e gave up a n d tottered back to
the campsite much to m y relief and
Colin's disgust.

By this time the bad weather had got
to Colin a n d he was not quite his usual
bright and sparkling self. I said 'don't
worry it'll be lovely tomorrow: the sun
will shine and the birds will sing and all
will be hunky-dory'. A n d so it was.
The W a l n a Scar Road is an old pack-
horse road w h i c h leads up from Coniston
past the O l d M a n and over a ridge south
of D o w Crag, Buck Pike and B r o w n Pike.
At the top of the pass our route left the
road, going steeply d o w n over boggy
ground, along a bridleway through to a
road with a steep downhill section to the
main road back to Coniston. This was
definitely the best route w e did, no doubt
helped b y the perfect weather, but it w a s
challenging for m y n e w found skills. T h e
terrain varied from the r o c k y W a l n a Scar
Road, to boggy grassland which is
a w k w a r d to ride on but makes a soft
landing, to a narrow path in the forest
interspersed with slippery tree roots. T h e
scenery was beautiful and m y joyous
mood could not even be broken by the
first fall to draw blood. O n arriving back
in Hawkeshead w e felt w e thoroughly
deserved our meal in the pub.
The fact that the next d a y was just as
nice made leaving and getting back to
the city all the harder.
Although I m o a n of the hell at the time
it was a great holiday; rain, scars, bruises,
Pasta Choices, tiny tent, smelly socks and
all. Mountain biking is hard work but the
effort pays off; m y fitness a n d skill
improved a lot over the holiday a n d I'm
ready for more.
Between us w e spent £200 o n the
holiday, most of this on food (and drink).
Camping made it cheaper than staying in
a youth hostel or B & B but ten nights i n a
tiny tent was certainly m y limit. Colin of
course, coped magnificently; his riding
was brilliant, he never complained and he
waited for me all the time. Enough to put
mere mortals like m e to shame, but he
does have a more expensive bike!
