Manager's Bit

Dismissal
The sacking of T o m Stevens, in a
sudden move by College, has been one of
the most interesting things to have
happened this term. Not that it ranks as
life or death o n the scale of even student
life at this place but just because of the
monumental back stabbing that has gone
into his expulsion. This being backed up
by the best bit of secret keeping that w e
have seen to date.
As the headline suggests, it is not just
the wish of an individual that has led to
this action, but the culmination of many
knives. It is well k n o w n that the feelings
of certain people has not helped in the
salvation of M r Stevens a n d it is
unfortunate to say the least that he failed
in the conquest of his job. It is after all
necessary for the establishment to guard
against f o u l - u p s , a n d important for us to
note that it is also in our interest.
The big question is will Rob Northey
stretch further his employement with
College after his July deferment in a new
position within the hierachy.
Rumours
During the whole business above 1 was
telephoned at the office to confirm the
rumour that Rob was infact staying on.
The gentleman concerned was most
hesitant i n giving his name a n d wished to
remain 'an interested student'.
Rumours are best kept to those y o u
k n o w or least can see. T h e y are certainly
not for people who utter the w o r d
'wanker' to there friend/s as they are
putting down the phone. If you want to
k n o w the inside story come along a n d
help collate o n Thursday evenings.
Challenge
After talking to Benjamin a n d Shan i n the
office it came to light that Benj had been
talking to the Editor of London Student.
Oh yes I said...the girl y o u were with in
the U L U bar last night. H e looked
impressed that I knew this a n d I simply
said that I have spies everywhere. Shan
then laid d o w n the challenge to find out
what he had got upto in Leeds over the
last few days at a conference that he
attended.
The forfits were exchanged a n d m y
search began. So far I a m quite happy to
report that things are going quite nicely
on m y side of things. I have located his
room mate a n d obtained a run d o w n o n
half the story, a n d have m a n y more leads
to chase up. 1 will therefore be publishing
a report o n his antics next week a n d it
looks like he will be sweeping and
hoovering m y offices in the near future.
