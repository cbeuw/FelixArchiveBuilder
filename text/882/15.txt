Introducing
Nigel the Biro
Nigel the Biro was one of life's footnotes,
always neglected and forgotten, his
friends called h i m N B . Once upon a time
he was a humble Felix biro, but he
became bored with his tiresome mundane
existence. Being used to proof reviews
and features was no life for an aspiring
young biro. So, one day he decided to
make a run for it. Leaping ball first into
the office black hole, he was transported
far away, never to return....

Dear Chris,
Sorry about m y sudden disappearance
last week, but being used on the Edwina
Curry article was too m u c h for a self
respecting biro. 1 have to say that m y
new life is m u c h more interesting with
my new owner.
He's very well off and lives in a big
house not far from y o u . He prefers to
spend other people's money even though
he's got lots of his o w n . For a knight
bachelor, his sartorial taste leaves a lot to
be desired, 1 mean really, strip and spot
lighting in a panelled room? His residence
is very large, so maybe I've only seen the
tacky bits.
He took me along to a meeting this
week, and w h e n he left me on the table I
had a chance to overhear a conversation
he was having with somebody from the
local council. I a m so pleased to have
such a generous owner w h o wants to
build lots of rooms for y o u n g people he
knows. H e must like them a lot, because
he's trying to keep them a l l together, in
fact he's even giving up a nice garden
(something to do with a prince 1 believe)
for them.
The nice m a n from the council said that
there would not be a problem with
planning permission, and m y owner says
he can get the money from Harlington
(the banks here have posh names, don't
they?). I do find it difficult to believe that
there won't be any interest o n a £2
million loan, though. Lots of the young
people eventually become accountants, so
maybe they arrange it.
He wants it to be a nice surprise so he's
not telling anyone about it. So keep it
under your hat Chris.
A n y w a y , I have some nice contracts to
sign, so I'll write again soon,
Lots of love,
NB.
