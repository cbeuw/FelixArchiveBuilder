The Nominated Rag Charities 1990st
FELIX
1. The British Institute for Brain
Injured Children (BIBIC) is based in
Somerset and is an old favourite with IC
Rag. They are a small charity with a
turnover of less than £200,000. They give
remedial help to mentally handicapped
children, attempting to give them back
control of their bodies, teaching them
how to use their muscles and limbs. They
also give help and advice to their families
so that they can lead a more normal life.
2. The W o r l d Wildlife Fund (WWF)
was established as a channel for popular
concern about conservation to create
effective action. This covers conservation
of the global environment alongside that
of endangered species.
3. Ele-Drive was set up recently as a
charity and is concerned with the
protection of wild elephants in Africa.
The protection is mainly against the
slaughtering of elephants in a most
horrific way for an unnecessary
commodity—their ivory. Expeditions take
place which carry out important
information gathering and research on
behalf of this charity.
4. Quest Cancer Test (formerly Quest
for a Test for Cancer) research into early
cancer detection including w o r k at the
Galton Laboratory which is part of
University College here in London.
Research is currently being conducted
into screening methods to detect genetic
predisposition to cancer. T h e cancers
being studied include colon, thyroid and
testcular, some of which can also affect
children.
5. Leukaemia Research Fund are
committed to the research of Leukaemia
and related blood disorders and to the
treatment and care of patients throughout
the United Kingdom. Progress is such that
up to 60% of children who develop the
disease have every possibility of a cure
and advances in the treatment of adults
have also been made. However, a cure in
many cases remains elusive.
