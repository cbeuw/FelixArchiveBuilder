Dear FELIX,
It's time for a whinge at the expense of
Southside Bar; for today I was nearly
physically expelled from the upper lounge
for merely closing a window.
A group from the Orienteering Club
were sitting beside the windows in the
upper lounge, enjoying some food from
Belushi's after a hard training session.
This was until a man with a painted face
came and opened them all. (Without even
asking us if we minded getting cold.) As
you would expect the outside air was
cold and came straight in to attack us.
Very shortly we all began to feel cold. I
think it would have been warmer to have
sat outside! Due to this I decided to close
some of the windows and stop the draft,
and the waste of energy.
W h e n I was doing this the same
strangely painted man (?) approached me
to leave them open. To this I explained
that it was cold and we wanted to stay
warm. Besides there was no one in the
disco yet getting incredibly hot due to
gyrating their bodies to Bros. So I closed
some more windows, the chill air was
now staying where it should be, outside
and away from me! I did however say
that I would re-open them when I left, or
when the disco got going. Strangely I was
told that this was impractical. (I closed
some more windows.) Once he'd noticed I
was informed that I'd be forcibly removed
from Southside if 1 closed any more.
I tried explaining in very simple words
that I was cold and the disco was empty,
but all to no avail. It was the House Rules
that decreed that the windows must be
open. H e also told me that he 'didn't give
a shit how many people were downstairs'.
Is this really the way in which to run
Southside with stuck-up dictators who
can't listen to reason? I don't think so. It
is however a very Imperial College way
of working.
Yours sincerely,
Shaun West, Orienteering Club
Secretary.

Dear Chris,
I would like to express my complete
disgust at the insult directed at the Arab
people and at Athena's racist conclusion
that because a person's fiame is not Joe
Bloggs (or any other 'traditional' English
sounding name) that he must be foreign.
For his information:
—I am English, born and bred
—I have not invaded any of HIS allies
—British universities are as much mine
as HIS.
If all Athena could find w r o n g with my
letter was my careless use of vocabulary,
then I hope he has learnt something from
the rest of it.
In future, I hope xenophobic bigots who
write in stick to something they know a
little bit about.
