Dear Sir,
In reply to Athena's letter of 2.11.90.
I must question the motives of one w h o
is prepared to take pot-shots at both
candidates for the RCSU Presidential
election, but is not prepared to provide
his/her real name.
The election could have been better
publicised, but both candidates ran
extensive publicity campaigns, every
aspect of w h i c h carried the dates of
hustings and results. A s usual, the hacks
were the only ones w h o volunteered to
man ballot boxes and one cannot expect
them to stand a l l day. For these reasons,
the voting stations consisted of a hack, a
chair and a black box, the latter being
the usual receptacle for voting slips. If the
aforementioned Athena wishes to
question the honesty of the people w h o
counted the votes, particularly the staff
member w h o was present, m a y I remind
h i m / h e r that this is a very serious
allegation a n d should be taken up with
the returning officer.
The letter did have some very valid
points; the RCSU had many problems last
year. T o o few people tried to do too
many jobs, hence the academic failure,
which was rife amongst last year's
officers. This had led to a poor academic
image, which w e are seeking to remedy.
O n to the last aspect of the letter. If a
non-hack standing for election and
winning means 'fucking the hacks', then
do it! James Briant, a non-hack, received
much support from the officers during his
Presidential campaign. H e was shown
Pear Sir
LETTERS
how the Union runs and personally
invited to events and meetings. In fact,
nothing would please us more than to see
him getting involved with the Union,
especially if he wishes to consider
standing again.
W e are always looking for suggestions
on improving the Union. W e ' v e made a
lot of changes in the last couple of
months and this has been reflected i n the
large number of first years w h o have
expressed interest in all aspects of the
RCSU. If y o u have any input o r want to
get involved, come along to the office at
any time—you're always welcome.

P.S. Got any spot cream?

Dear Chris,
Upon reading the article b y Athena, I
feel obliged to answer in support of M r S
Choudhery. Athena's sole purpose i n his
insolent article is to slag Saleem and Arab
culture off. M a y b e he should be reminded
that parts of our culture actually originate
from the Far and Middle East. Is his
article the 'Last Resort' seen as the
arguments are too weak to withstand a n y
form of debate.
Yours,
B Muratori.

Dear Chris
I was most shocked to find a
horrendous slur o n m y character i n Felix
881. In the letter 'Spotty Hacks' that
slagged off the R C S U it was incorrectly
stated that I w a s i n the top 12 of the
year. This is a lie and I demand an
immediate apology from the letter writer
(I did pass fairly well though!)
Perhaps the letter writer was confused
since the H o n . Sec. of Guilds was the
person i n the top twelve.
Yours,
Joe Fernley
C&GU Vice-President
