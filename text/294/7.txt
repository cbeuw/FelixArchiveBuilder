S P O R T S F E L I X
st X V beat Kings away
On Wednesday 28th the
1st X V beat Kings College
1st X V by 8 pts to 3 pts in
a rather scrappy and unin-
spiring game. The game was
marred by the student ref-
eree (deputising for the ab-
sent society ref) and num-
erous "incidents" arose —
especially between members
of both back rows!
After their tremendous
wins previously, I.C. looked
for a good points tally, but
this was foiled by some
strong forward play by
Kings. Superb in the line-out
for I.C. was fresher Roy
Morris who won plenty of
good ball and must be well
placed with his performance
The scoring was opened by
full back Pudney who kicked
a 35 yd penalty goal. After
a good handling movement
Kip Conolly went over for
a good try which Pudney
converted. Kings cut the
lead with a penalty goal but
could not crack a resistant
I.C. defence in the fast-
paced second half.
T E A M : Pudney, Ander-
son, Conolly (capt), Brown-
lee, Devaney, Roberts, Hill,
Darling, Earl, Widelski,
Owens, Morris, Hunt, Icely,
Adams.
The 1st X V ' s record now
reads: played 5, won 4, lost
1, pts for 106, pts against
28.
This is a very good start
•to the season, some good
victories having been regis-
tered. Royal Free Hospital
I st X I unbeaten
On Saturday, 24 October
I.C. entertained Q.E.C. in
the first round of the U.L.U.
Cup. Q.E.C. turned out to
be a much tougher proposi-
tion to the team beaten in
a pre-season friendly, they
tackled harder and faster,
unsettling a weakened I.C.
side fjor much of the first
half. I.C. however took com-
mand in the second half
when their fitness proved
fatal for Q.E.C. Geoff Bar-
nard, playing with real vig-
our and enthusiasm ran on
to an R. Dixon pass to slot
home No. 1, this brought
Q.E.C. out of steam and
Tony Holland took advan-
tage, breaking away to score
twice. This was how it fin-
ished, 3 nil. I.C.. were tired
but fully in command.
On Wednesday 28 again
at Harlington, the 1st X I
entertained the professional
looking Lanchester, a Teach-
ers Training College in Cov-
entry. Lanchester ran hard
for the first half but once
again I.C. came through in
the second half. Goals came
from Byron Smith and T.
McArdle. B . Smith playing
his first game for the lsts
showed that he is going to
be a great asset. I.C.'s de-
fence covered brilliantly dur-
ing this game, Lanchester's
goal coming from a silly
mistake which should never
have occurred.
I.C.'s goal tally now reads
19 for — 2 against after 5
games.

well, P. Maslin, S. Boyce,
C. Willcock, J. Darley, R .

Special mention in the 2nd
X I also unbeaten goes to
Bill Milne who has slam-
med 15 goals in 5 games.
R. Dixon
were beaten by 49 pts to 6
pts on Wednesday 21st in
a match where the team
really "clicked" for the first
time. On the following Sat-
urday a very good strong
Old Guildfordians side was
beaten 15 pts to 8 pts at
Guildford. A n excellent
game, marred only by a ser-
ious injury to prop Dave
Amos, who broke his collar
bone and cracked a should-
er bone too. His strength
Vvill be surely missed in the
matches to come against the
the big club sides.
The Extra lsts under the
captaincy of Tony Williams
remain unbeaten and the
Rugby Club seem to have a
rare spirit kindling in the
lower sides.

I.C. 1st XI 2
Our first match of the
season played on 14 October
produced a well-earned vic-
tory against Guys. Although
the pitch was described as a
'cabbage patch' we managed
to produce some construc-
tive hockey.
Both our goals were
scored by Dave Wilson, one
of the two freshers in the
side, who hammered two
short corners in with consid-
erable ease.
i.C. 1st XI 1
West Essex 1st XI 1
Although we scored first
through Dave Wilson we
were unable to contain the
attack of the opponents who
equalised after a long cor-
ner shortly before half-time.
Lack of fitness was dis-
tinctly evident in the second
half and despite good per-
formances by Alistair
Forbes and Tim Watson, as
full backs, West Essex scor-
ed again. In the dying sec-
onds, our equaliser was dis-
allowed lor obstruction.
Turning to the lower
elevens, the 2nd X I drew 1-1
and 3rd X I and 4th X I won
2-1 and 5-3 respectively.
St. John's Cambridge 0
I.C. 1st XI 1
This fixture was reduced
to 8 men against 9 for most
of the game due to injuries
E D I T O R I A L
In a page packed with good results for I.C. one notices
a disconcerting trend of dominance by the three big clubs
of soccer, rugby, and hockey. As mentioned last week, the
college possess some twenty clubs, half of which we never
hear of. This does not mean they are not having successes
in their own sport but are not involved with the University
sport, many of them face disheartening problems of fixtures,
finance, facilities, etc. but instead of being depleted in num-
bers they seem to increase each year! The volleyball club,
as an example, are negotiating with Brunei University to
combine members and facilities so that the club can enjoy
a national standard of fixtures — best of luck!
Constituent college propaganda is already building up
Morphy Day as an exercise in battle strategies and acquisi-
tion of the best "ammo''! Let us not forget what it means to
the Boat Club, if to none else, at least! This is the annual
inter-collegiate boat race for the Morphy Cup. Some inten-
sive early season training has been endured for this race so
good luck to the three crews, if anyone takes any notice of
them. Guilds, with an international class of boat, must start
firm favourites.
To reiterate the first paragraph, we must have more
news of the smaller clubs for this to be a comprehensive
sports page for the whole of I.C. Surely the table tennis club
have smashed someone lately?
caused by our new forward
Ian Tasney (now Mech Eng
II), and the subsequent trip
to the hospital.
However we managed to
score from one of our many
chances through Pete (Mas-
ter?) Bates.
Last Saturday saw <
t fine
win for the 1 si X I against
Dulwich II by 2 goals to 1.
We fielded four teams, much
to everybody's surprise, con-
sisting of 36 plajers! The
second *eam first played for
4th X I and then as the 2nd
X I (in an attempt to get
fit!)

If anybody who is still in-
terested in playing hockey
and who has not vet seen
a member of the commit-
tee, I would be grateful if
he would contact me as
soon as possible.

Skiing on the cheap
IC Ski Club offers you a
chalet party in Europe at
Easter which will cost a cer-
tain amount of money, but
it also offers more local acti-
vities which are partly spon-
sored by the union, resulting
in much cheaper skiing. For
instance, beginners and less
experienced skiers can gain
enormous benefit from a
course at the dry ski centre
at Crystal Palace, for a
paltry sum. More advanced
skiers might like to try their
legs at grass skiing, using
caterpillar or tank-like
tracks rather than normal
skis. Hopefully, enough good
skiers will train on the near-
est hills to form an IC team
to compete in the ever-grow-
ing grass-skiing race circuit.
Furthermore as a member
of IC ski club, you are auto-
matically in U L Ski Club,
which skis regularly on the
waters of Ruislip Water Ski
Club in the Summer.
The equipment you will
need for these variations of
skiing is minimal: jeans, old
sweater and gloves, or
a swimsuit. Skis, sticks etc.
can be rented for a very
small fee.
Racing on snow occurs in
Switzerland (UL are British
Alpine Ski Champions 1970)
— where certain racers will
race in the British and Com-
monwealth Winter Games—
and also in Scotland in Feb-
ruary, March and April.
Last year IC came second
in the intercollegiate races
and disappointingly U L were
only placed fourth in the
Universities races, behind
Oxford and two Scottish uni-
versities (whose team mem-
bers were almost exclusively
Norwegian).
All results and articles for next
issue's Sports pages should be
given to Mike Adams (Falmouth
248) before midnight on Wednes -
day 11th November
Thus IC Ski Club can
offer a great deal. If you are
interested in any activity of
the club (or would like to
buy Fischer skis of any var-
iety at half-price) please con-
tact George Hamer via
chemistry or the union let-
ter rack.

airlines
