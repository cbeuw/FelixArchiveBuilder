COLCUTT
I will never cease to be amazed by the number of people
who have the nerve to call themselves workers. The latest to
claim the title (or so C.E.F.E. says) are students, Arab
terrorists, and judging by the disgusting display outside
the Canadian High Commission on October 25, Kidnappers!
How any of these groups qualify as workers is very puzzling.
The student claim is based on the fact that the N.U.S. is a
trade union and not on any actual work performed. This
argument cannot be very convincing as other trade unionists
and real workers have definite views about students, but
none of them mention the word worker! In fact no trade
union has asked for student support in industrial action and
are not very interested in the hypothetical views of people
who do not actually work for their living.
It is probably this rejection by the real workers that has
caused the student workers to give their support to causes
so outrageous that they have little other support in civilized
societies. The title worker has been conferred upon the Arab
terrorists and hijackers who are seeking to overthrow Israel.
If they were the workers they claim to be, why was a great
influx of Jewish immigrants needed to turn a piece of desert
into a now desirable piece of real estate? Here is obviously
a case where real workers have built a society they want
and pseudo-workers want to destroy it!
The latest moves over South Africa have now reached
ridiculous proportions: rather than take any action to batter
the position of coloured people in South Africa or enlighten
the white South Africans even to the extent of letting them
play against our mixed cricket teams, the action taken is to
boycott British firms who may or may not have connections
in S.A. This presumably shows that they are concerned at
the situations but do not wish to do anything of a construc-
tive nature. Still if the proposers of this action boycott all
the firms mentioned they will soon have nothing to wear,
very little to eat and absolutely no luxury goods.

The Westminster Theatre gives the impression that the
Moral Re-Armament is rolling in money, and it certainly is.
A n organization of this sort is not usually expected to possess
exessive funds and one immediately gets the suspicion that
all may not be as it seems. With whom does its sympathies
lie? "Up lazy worker and do thy job" — could this be what
this play really wanted to say? If so, the hint was very
subtle. The play and the M R A is intended for all types of
people but unfortunately the audience was as usual pseudo-
upper middle class.
Honesty, purity, love and unselfishness are impressed upon
as valuable virtues; also "self-improvement is the only viable
solution to the world's ills" was the main theme of the play.
The fact, that part of a system cannot view objectively the
system of which it is a part, was hinted upon.
The actors performed well, despite the limitations of the
script; especially Katherine Page who excellently portrayed
the doting mother of an erring son. Innocence and sensitivity
were rather well conveyed by Carolyn Courage, a K E N S I N G -
T O N girl. The doctor, played by Michael Malnick, seemed
to be the only real character in this rather simple allegory.

Last week International Times or IT as it has become
known, celebrated their fourth anniversary with a four
page spread of news, photos and guff dating from 1966. In
fact, the paper started in October of that year as a joke
but now in 1970 (after various busts and rinds) has never
looked stronger.
IT'S way of reporting news items is callous, blatant and
brutal and consequently quite likeable. It often helps to
tell bad (and good) news in the worst possible way. Note
the only comment on the conclusion of the space race in
June 1969—'Pigs dump garbage on moon'. The paper is
one of those few 'underground' newspapers which actually
does take the trouble to report underground news. Where in
the nationals could you find the headline 'DOPE CRISIS',

This I.C. Zoological Ex-
pedition was unusual in non
bona fide zoologists among
its number, and in fact that
two of the four members
were drawn from L.S.E. In
spite of this our aims were
not to spread political sub-
version, but to study the
bird life, (feathered of
course), small mammals and
insects in the north-eastern
part of Iran.
We left England in mid
July in a new, shining white,
somewhat overloaded V W
Microbus, and returned in
late September in a dirty
brown somewhat dented
V W Microbus (1 careful
owner, as new? 6 months old,
only 19,000 miles!) The
journey across Europe took
three days, and was notable
for the bad weather, (we did
not discard our pullovers
until 60 miles from the Tur-
kish border), and the num-
ber of Mars bars' we con-
sumed. After resting in
Istanbul, we drove across
Turkey, stopping overnight
at Ankara, Samsun, Trabzon
and Ercurum. We reached
the Iranian border on a
Friday evening, and were in
Tehran late the following
day. We spent five rather
frustrating days in Tehran,
which in summer is unbear-
ably hot and dusty, while the
van was serviced, and we
obtained our collecting per-
mits from the Ministry of
Game and Fish.
Gladly leaving the capital
we crossed the Elbwz Moun-
tains to the green and humid
region bordering the Caspian
Sea, a complete contrast to
the endless descent on the
other side. Our first camp
was by the Forest Park of
Sissangan. Unfortunately
only three nights after we
arrived we awoke to find all
our cases, which had been
in the outer compartment of
our tent, had been stolen
while we were sleeping. How-
ever with a little help from
the army, including a
Colonel, a Major and a Cap-
tain directing operations,
most of our gear was dug up
from a beach about a half
a mile from our camp. The
only things that were missing
were a watch a wallet and a
pair of gold pyjamas
(kinky)!
We also acquired a mas-
cot, an Edible Dormouse
which was brought to us
dangling by one leg from the
handle bars of a forester's
bicycle. Horace, as he was
named, became quite tame,
but alas after several weeks
we decided to move him to
a more spacious cage which
proved to be rather less than
'dormouse proof. So Horace
returned to the wild, instead
of a pickling jar.
After leaving Sissangan
we visited the Mohammed
Rezar Shah Memorial Park,
some 80 miles east of the
Caspian. This is a wild moun-
tainous region, with magnifi-
cent natural oak forests,
which are the haunt of bear,
deer and leopard. On the
and read how the Mafia snubbed the British dope scene
because it was too loose to be worth taking over. How much
of the news stories are based on truth is difficult to ascer-
tain. But it's also relatively unimportant. IT serves the
purpose of shocking people but not, I'm certain, those who
read it with any regularity. Yet some people must buy the
paper for the underground news cum propaganda that it
contains. Other people must also read IT because it's quite
a laugh—and doesn't even take its own ideals seriously—
here's one of last week's cartoons—
'All right kid! We know vou take drugs'.
'What do you take?'
'A little acid . . . some hash . . . a bit of grass, some
speed . . . a few mandies now an' again, a few beers, a . . .'
'What were you doing yesterday at 12?'
'Yesterday? When was yesterday'?
rocky ledges wild goat, Ibex,
can be seen. We also were
told that the Caspian Tiger
still exists in small numbers
in this region, although the
Game Dept. in Tehran are
sceptical about this.
We returned to the Caspian
coast, where we spent the
last four weeks collecting,
and studying the bird migra-
tion along the Caspian plain,
in the Goryon Lagoon re-
gion. By the time we finished
we had caught nearly 500
birds, and had observed
several species which were
unusual in Iran. We had also
amassed a collection of about
1.000 insects, 100 pickled
bats (which we collected
using a butterfly net in the
lofts of the local houses),
and about 50 assorted mice
and rats, which were also
pickled. (AH of which were
allowed through Customs
duty free!)
The local people were ex-
tremely hospitable and on
our last evening we were in-
vited to a Moslem engage-
ment party in the local
village, and acted as 'official'
photographers. We had an
extremely happy evening and
left well charged with
Vodka.
The homeward journey
was uneventful, and com-
pleted in 10 days, after an
extremely worthwhile ex-
pedition.
