IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 5th NOVEMBER, 1970 No. 294
BO SETS OFF
Sunday morning saw the
start of this year's R A C Vet-
eran car rally from Hyde
Park Corner to Brighton.
Taking part as usual was
Guild's Boanerges, in yet an-
other bid for disqualification
on grounds of excess speed !
On ithe crack of 7.20 a.m.
Southside were stirred into
life by Guilds' President Rog
Wiltshire blowing the dawn
chorus on a megaphone.
Standing a discreet distance
away from the building to
avoid the occasional shower
of water he succeeded in
arousing a number of
staunch Guildsmen clad in
the odd bathrobe, pair of
pyjamas, tin hat or flying
jacket.
Across to Weeks hall
where the same happened.
An unexpected early riser
was one of the local ladies
who pleaded with Ieuan
Thomas to stop the noise.
Pleadings turned to insults
on the reply "Why don't you
go to bed earlier then? un-
til Weeks having vomited its
share of Guildsmen, the as-
sembly moved on to Hyde
Park.
And so to the rally itself:
PREPARATION FOR T H E S T A R T
Serpentine Road was crawl-
ing with fuzz and R A C of-
ficials moving onlookers off
the roal itself with the use of
megaphones similar to
Guilds' . . . But the oppor-
tunity was not seized and
disturbances were limited to
the odd Boomalaka.
Around 8.20 Bo set off: a
good clean start rendering
unnecessary any assistance.
The last view we had was of
Bo disappearing in the gen-
eral direction of the south
coast, surrounded by a dozen
or so Guildsmen, their
shoulders to Bo's posterior.

RCS will take place on Saturday the 7th November A D

en route, and is entitled to hold the " Maxiwink " award for

W I N K E R Y .
N e w s In B r i e f
After a recent concert in
the Great Hall, Domesticated
Beast CCS was seen examin-
ing cigarette butts found on
the floor. Was it fire regula-
tions that worried him, or
were there more sinister im-
plications in his researches?
Nobody could blame M r . S.
for feeling agitated — there
are many clearly visible "No
Smoking" signs.
However, reports say that
after re-lighting one of the
butts to examine its sub-
stance, his mood radically
improved.

Southside Residents will
have noticed a somewhat
"out of the ordinary" bumph
sheet slipped under their
doors last week.
F E L I X was asked to re-
print the sheet, but in view of
its appearance in Guildsheet
and a comment thereon in
Broadsheet, there seems little
point in doing so. The sub-
ject of the circular is the
threat to slam an injunction
against the whole of South-
side by the residents of the
Mews. Oddly enough, the
sheet doesn't exactly say
what S/S residents are expec-
ted to do.
T H I N K S . . . perhaps it
was produced by residents of
the mews anyway . . .
THINKS.

Southside residents might
also have noticed that their
Halls are (once again) fall-
ing to bits. It hardly seems
more than a year since the
concrete facing blocks on the
building were fixed back in
place. But already several of
these blocks are in a very
dangerous state, and F E L I X
knows of at least one room
where the resident can see
through to the outer air un-
derneath his windowledge.

The number of glasses
The Scunthorpe inflatable knees champion, Steve Rad-
cliffe, due to an unfortunate refusal to inflate, was placed
only third in the Mr. ICWA stakes last Thursday. Proposed
by Rick Weightman, his jointed appendages, though admit-
tedly projecting in scintillatingly obscene protruberances, lost
the title to those of Pete Earl. Pete's masculine yet tender
charms have at last, after many years of career-mongering,
won for him this most sought-after of accolades — this man
is more than just knees.
Narrowly beaten into 2nd place was Andy Jackson, whose
knees were a mated pair, rarely found in ithis climate, and
whose proposer (Chris Hedley), read to us some of the more
salient points of knee history, which he had discovered on a
scroll (a bag-scroll!) in ithe lower Union loo.
The serious candidate, Dave Devlin, was placed equal third
when his boomerang, nuclear fission knees, (purported to be
able to alter, with their " get-up-and-go," ICWA'S attitude
of " lie-down-and come) revealed surface screw-faults under
microscopic examintion.
missing from the Union Bar
due to breakages has now
risen to such an extent that
the barman, Brendan, has
had to station one of his stu-
dent barmen at the entrance
to stop people walking out
with glasses. Customers Who
wish to drink outside are re-
quested to use paper cups.
However, while customers
are waiting for their mates
to find them pint pots, they
can now partake of a quick
snack in the form of a pork
pie or a hot steak and kidney
pic. Since Brendan started
selling the pies, custom has
boomed at lunch time, and
the bar now sells 12 dozen
each day.
Ft does seem a pity
though, that this increased
turnover due to Brendan
(£18 profit per week on pies)
is not reflected by an in-
crease in his wages. A t pre-
sent, despite his added res-
ponsibility and attempts to
improve the Union Bar,
Brendan is paid the same
wage as the ordinary bar-
men.
And now, a Carnival Short
Story.
On Tuesday, 20th October,
four minesmen out on a
foraging expedition for Car-
nival in the darkest West End
were gently led to West End
Central, where they were
closely interrogated for an
hour.
It transpired that these
" hooligans " did not have a
valid licence for street col-
lecting, due to a clerical er-
ror !!!). The outcome was
that £6 was impounded and
a report sent to Scotland
Yard about this heinous
crime.
In statements to the police,
the minesmen of course
thrust full blame onto their
dubious boss, a certain D.T.
Pending the police report,
the licences should come
through this week, when we
can at last start on proper
illegal collections.
