Commemoration day I.G.U.
That hardy perennial of
IC, Commemoration Day.
has now passed by for
another year; barely acknow-
ledged by most of the
College, except as a reason
for a free afternoon. Yet
even through the mists of
tradition, one can see a basic
need for the occasion. It is
simply a logical extension of
a school's speech day or
founder's day — awards and
fellowships are distributed
with all the generosity of
Christmas. However it's diffi-
cult to see a reason for the
strange middle-aged garb
since IC is less than 150
years old — a youngster as
some universities go.
GUEST
Special visitor was Mr.
Andrew Schonfield, who, be-
sides becoming a Fellow,
gave a speech entitled 'Social
Science: Its uses and limita-
tions'. In concluding, Mr.
Schonfield made an interest-
ing and relevant social com-
ment — quote —
"It may be felt by some
that it is clear proof of in-
adequacy that social scien-
tists can only supply aid to
others who make decisions,
and not themselves take
over the process of decision-
making as the technologist
is able to do. I would sug-
gest that one might go fur-
ther than this and point to
the fact that the application
of technology within a given
system is in principle capable
of being programmed
through a computer, whereas
social decisions are not. And
that leads me to my favourite
quote of this year, which
comes from a member of
this College, Mr. H . Fair-
brother. In a letter to the
Times, explaining why it is
that computers will in cer-
tain circumstances produce
consistently inferior answers
to those supplied by a human
being using the same logic,
he concluded: 'The reason:
the computer is an idiot
when it comes
pitfalls!'"
TRAVEL
to avoiding
1 hope, this year, more
people will know about the
above institution before I
start writing about it.
Started two years ago, its
growth rate has been rapid
—last year's turnover rose by
over 200% on the previous
year, '.o stand at approxi-
mately £1,100. It is now a
legally registered travel
bureau and one that offers
the cheapest fares available,
to anywhere in the world —
last year by returning our
commission to our clients wc
even undercut N.U.S. Travel!
Direct booking is em-
ployed for flights and trains
to Europe, N . Africa and the
Near East, while information
is given about travel to the
U.S.A.. Canada, Japan, Aus-
tralia, S. Africa, India. Hong
BUREAU
Kong etc. For those latter
destinations, especially Aus-
tralia, it is advisable to ap-
proach us as soon as pos-
sible. Information about Ski-
ing holidays and vacation
employment overseas is aLo
available.

Stephenson Asked To Resign
At Elections Union Meeting
No one supports South
Africa's apartheid policy but
how prepared are we to
demonstrate opposition? to
put ourselves out so that
others can benefit?
We have already con-
demned tours by racial se-
lected South African sports
teams and the maintenance
of any cultural and sporting
links between colleges and
South Africa Where these up-
hold the apartheid system.
It was also agreed to support
the Boycott Barclays cam-
paign — and Barclays are
worried — witness their
counter campaign. Student
custom is important to banks
for small students graduate
to become big savers. The
aim is to put pressure (boy-
cots mean publicity) on Bar-
clays Bank to withdraw their
financial backing of the Ca-
bora Bassa.
We must be willing to act
in support of those who have
to fight and die for their be-
liefs, i.e. in Mozambique
Frelimo; in Rhodesia the
Zimbabwe movements, in
South Africa the ANC. In
terms of our moral commit-
ment against apartheid, our
overriding aims should be to
help black action, for it has
to be recognised that white
liberalism has failed in South
Africa, so that freedom can
probably only be achieved
through the liberation move-
ments. These movements re-
quire moral and financial
backing.
The Student Councils of
the black colleges of South
Africa are deliberately
starved of funds by the gov-
ernment — they are also
afraid to organise openly —
ways could be investigated
of assisting these non-white
university student SRC's, to
improve their educational
facilities and organisation.
Could I.C. award scholar-
ships to those students who
are the victims of oppression
— instead of offering schol-
arships to Europeans only?
Anti - Apartheid is cam-
paigning to persuade aca-
demics against taking up
posts in South Africa. The
T.U.C. already has a policy
(not exactly effective!) of
disuading British labour
from emigrating to South
Africa. Skilled labour, grad-
uates, are required to main-
tain a large white work
force. We could try to dis-
courage people from taking
jobs in South Africa. Adver-
tisements for employment in
South Africa could be pro-
hibited in the Appointments
Board. South African pro-
ducts could be banned from
the refectories.
Furthermore, are we to
expose the links which exist
between I.C. and South
Africa, particularly through
investments, governors who
hold directorships of South
African companies, educa-
tional and business connec-
tions? The historical respon-
sibility for the creation and
continuation of apartheid
rests with Britain. If the
Africans can give their lives,
surely we can make sacri-
fices? The question is not
should we do anything —
but what we C A N do, as
students, to actively oppose
apartheid.
There will be a discussion
on Southern Africa today
(Thursday) in Mech Eng
220, where people who know
the situation will speak,
thereby allowing us to dis-
cuss what action we can
take. This directly involves
us!
The l.C. Union meeting
of October 27th was reason-
ably well attended despite
minimal advertising and a
little known agenda.
The main business, apart
from the elections, was a
motion from George Ou-
bridgc concerning the lack
of activity of the refectory
committee and calling for the
resignation of M r . Stevenson
as chairman. The motion was
opposed formally and carried
with very little opposition. It
was also decided to picket
the ante-room of the buttery
in college block, but this was
not carried with such a large
majority. Pete Gillet, ner-
vous but determined in the
face of a hostile audience,
proposed a motion to send a
letter to the home secretary
deploring the expulsion of
Rudi Dutchke, the German
student leader who has
been refused permission to
study in England after be-
ing accepted by a University
here. The motion was in
danger of not being discussed
by the meeting, due to some-
one proposing that the mo-
tion be not put, but the
resulting vote was unclear
and the motion was saved
by Geoff Needham speaking
up in Mr. Gillcts favour, and
so the motion was discussed
and finally partly carried.
The elections followed, and
after a list of unopposed
candidates was read to the
meeting, the candidates for
the publication board stood
for election. Stuart Jackson
failed to appear, so Piers
Corbyn had to propose him
in his absence, and in the
final ballot Roger Lindsay
and Ian Carr were elected.
The candidates for the post
of floor rep. on I.C. council
were John Darley, Jack
Kalzberg and Pete Lambert,
all standing for the place
made vacant by Andy Os-
mond who headed the pre-
vious year's poll but was un-
able to take up the post this
year. A l l three candidates
were ably proposed, and
John Darley was elected after
reallocation of Mr. Lambert's
vote.
Piers Corbyn was elected
as the NUS representative for
the External Affairs Com-
mittee. The resignation of
Brian Hains from the posi-
tion of Acedemic Affairs
Officer was then read out,
who stated that he could not
hold this position without a
place in hall (it would be his
fourth). This position is still
vacant.
