a
n thwarts thief
At 4:00p.m. yesterday M r . John Smith, the College Secretary
a n d f o r m e r G o v e r n e r o f the G i l b e r t & E l l i c e I s l a n d s ,
arrested a thief i n his office.
The Thief, whose name is uncertain at the time of going to press,
was described earlier as 'Malaysian-looking with dark hair' when he
was reported to College Security at 2:00p.m. as a suspicious
character.
Mr. Smith observed the thief leaving his office at 3:45p.m. His
suspicions aroused, he discovered that his wallet had been stolen.
Upon challenging the thief he noticed his wallet sticking out of the
gentleman's trousers—a struggle ensued, a window was broken and
the thief overpowered.
The police arrived shortly afterwards but did not allow a full
search of the thief in the College which means a delay in compiling
a full list of the other items stolen from Sherfield.
London Student to fold ?
London Student ( f o r m e r l y Sennet) a p p e a r s to b e r u n n i n g i n t o f i n a n c i a l
difficulties. T h e i r usual p r i n t e r , Baileys of D u r s l e y , G l o s , has been d r o p p e d
a n d a n e w p r i n t e r sought. T h i s looks likely to be Febedge's o f H a c k e n e y — a
test p r i n t r u n will take place at the e n d o f A u g u s t to see if the n e w p r i n t e r
c a n b o t h c o p e w i t h t h e h e c t i c s c h e d u l e i n h e r e n t in p r i n t i n g a w e e k l y
n e w s p a p e r a n d c o m e u p to the q u a l i t y previously o b t a i n e d b y Baileys. W i t h
the c h a n g e of printers comes a c h a n g e i n process; f r o m letterpress to offset
litho. W e at F E L I X look f o r w a r d to seeing the n e w - l o o k n e w s p a p e r as we
c h a n g e d f r o m Bailey's letterpress to offset-litho o n U n i o n premises i n 1974.
W h e n it appears the n e w s p a p e r will be slightly smaller t h a n usual with a
freshly designed header. (Incidentally, hope you like our new header - Ed.)
H o w e v e r , a c h a n g e o f printers will not relieve London Student's financial
difficulties. N e x t year o n l y 22 issues w i t h a n eight page m a x i m u m will be
p r o d u c e d . A l s o , student unions h a v e for the first time been asked to p a y a
subscription for the n e w s p a p e r o f 2 1
/ 2 p p e r c o p y . I C will be t a k i n g 300
c o p i e s . S u b s c r i p t i o n s at present s t a n d at 6,700. A b o u t seven t h o u s a n d
subscriptions are needed at present to break even (in 1974, Sennet boasted
100,000 c i r c u l a t i o n ) . If sufficient subscriptions o r a d v e r t i s i n g revenue is n o t
f o r t h c o m i n g , it seems likely that London Student will fold after C h r i s t m a s thus
g i v i n g F E L I X the largest c i r c u l a t i o n o f a n y L o n d o n student newspaper.
A day at Buck House
On Thursday, 17th July, a few College notables were invited to
attend a garden party to honour the Queen Mother, who is the
patron of the University of London.
The mode of transport was the College motorised mascots to add
authenticity to the occasion. With Miss Jo Armitage dressed in pink
hat and hastily made summer frock in Bo and Messrs Fox and
O'Boyle, dressed in Moss Bros morning attire, accompanied by the
Wheales in Jez, they set ofF in a light summer rain to the palace
With the passengers dropped ofi" at the door, the transportation
took up their allotted positions in the Mall, ready to collect their
charges.
The participants, however, felt rather out of their depth, and, with
the exception of Miss Armitage, who engaged two old ladies in brief
converstion no-one did very much, though, I understand, M r .
O'Boyle was very much on the look-out for any 'spare' aristocracy.
A venture to see the Queen and assorted Royals was foiled by the
huge queues of people with the same purpose in mind and the
ambition to do something, in the Beatles mode, in the Royal loos
did not materialise.
As one can guess, the party, if that's what it was, dragged on a
bit, and all were quite ready to leave at the appointed time; I think
the weather had a hand in this, though.
The motors were summoned over the loudspeaker system, "the
car for Miss Jo Armitage", etc, from the Mall and the 'party goers'
were duly picked up. Alas, Jez was not allowed to pass through the
Inner Gates by a Palace Official, so her charges had to walk.
It is understood from the few participants that I spoke to that the
best piece of the afternoon was coming and going, with the hawks
trying to guess who these strangely attired people, with as many as
three chauffers each, were. A good time was had by all!
