Sir
I w o u l d like to b e the first to
c o m p l a i n about y o u r first attempt at
p r o d u c i n g a P H A L L I X . E v e n
t h o u g h I haven't seen a n y o f it yet,
I ' m sure it will b e p a c k e d w i t h the
same w e a l t h of d e g r a d i n g m a t e r i a l
w h i c h f o r m e d o n e of y o u r previous
p u b l i c a t i o n s (you k n o w , that one).
Besides inflicting y o u r o w n insidious
r a m b l i n g s o n a n innocent postgrad
c o m m u n i t y y o u will, n o d o u b t , be
i n c l u d i n g l e t t e r s * f u l l of u s e l e s s
r u b b i s h , like this one. I think it's
pitiful. W e all k n o w that fees are too
h i g h , grants a r e too low, L i b e r a l
C l u b shouldn't b e a l l o w e d to d o
what they d o a n d J u s t i n N e w l a n d

I also think this is a lousy w a y o f

D e a r Sweetie,
T o m y h o r r o r , I have recently

' r i p p i n g o i F t h e 'filthy r i c h ' , I see
this as a gross injustice.

I a m not o n e to write reams o f
meaningless d r i v e l just to get m y
n a m e in F E L I X b u t , this time I feel
I really must m a k e a n exception
a n d p u t p e n to paper. Seriously, i n
all m y time at I C I have never been
so s h o c k e d , n o r so a n n o y e d by what
is g o i n g o n .
I thought that there must be some
integrity left i n the students o f today
but a p p a r e n t l y there is not so m u c h
as o n e g r a i n of c o m m o n sense o r
d e c e n c y i n a n y o n e o f t h e m .
It is a far c r y f r o m m y first days
at university w h e n students were

s t a n d i n g citizens w h o , i f at times a
l i t t l e b o i s t e r o u s , w e r e a t l e a s t ,

N o t so t o d a y ! It was o n l y recently
that the true d e p r a v i t y to w h i c h

I must say that I w h o l e h e a r t e d l y

H o w e v e r , y o u a l r e a d y k n o w this. I
write this m o r e as a p l e a d i n g letter
to those people out there w h o have
m a t e r i a l for F E L I X . Please get it i n

w o r l d m o r e irritating t h a n t r y i n g to

W e l l , here it is, the first highly exciting " P G T i p s " c o l u m n o f the
new regime, packed lull of exciting facts a n d useful hints towards
l e a d i n g a full a n d active life.
First though, the committee:

T h i s year I intend to continue the scheme, started last year,
encouraging departmental groups to set u p a n d get busy organising
events, both with their o w n departments a n d o n a wider scale, as in
inter-departmental football matches — the carrot being the offer o f
cash or equipment.
Last year there was a m i n o r hassle, as a n open oiler was made to
all departments a n d we h a d no idea what was h a p p e n i n g until the
bills arrived, some o f w h i c h h a d to be settled out o f this year's cash,
w h i c h sent G r a h a m into a right tizzy. T h i s year then, tell us
what y o u i n t e n d d o i n g first a n d things s h o u l d r u n a lot m o r e
smoothly. T h e best way to get your share is to coopt some m e m b e r
of your department as a rep a n d send them a l o n g to o u r meetings.
Also if np one comes u p with a n y exciting ideas, we'll be stuck with
the usual forty-five b a r nights a n d the o d d ploughmans.
A n o t h e r a m b i t i o n o f m i n e is to actually hold a quorate general
meeting at least once d u r i n g the year.

r a v i n g about the inadequate a n d expensive refectory service over
summer, the fact that Stan's B a r prices are also u p , the cricket
pitches at H a r i i n g t o n were ripped u p at the b e g i n n i n g o f s u m m e r ,
P h D students average four a n d a half years to finish a n d are lucky if
they see their supervisors more than twice a year, but il n o one
other than myself has voiced a n y o p i n i o n o n these matters, I ' m
not g o i n g to be able to fight with m u c h conviction. Last year's
questionnaire, for instance, received about 10% response, a n d most
of them P h D s . It has been suggested that this year's reps should go
r o u n d physically visiting as m a n y as possible, w o u l d you reply then?
A n o t h e r thing that bugs me is that P G G r o u p receives only £ 5 6 0
f r o m t h e U n i o n , t h o u g h a d m i t t e d l y , i n t h e past t h e y ' v e h a d
difficulty spending this m u c h , but 30p return from the £ 3 9 you're
putting in doesn't strike m e as very generous. O f course a lew P G s
d o take advantage o f the full range o f U n i o n facilities, especially
sports, but d o y o u think you're getting a fair share? Please let me
know.
