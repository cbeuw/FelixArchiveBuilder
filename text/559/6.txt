Boys Don't Cry
(Fiction Records)
This album is an imported compila-
tion of early Cure. It features all
the pre "17-seconds" singles and
the s m o o t h e r parts of " T h r e e
Imaginary Boys".
It opens with the anti-fashion
song 'Jumping Someone Else's
Train', follows with 'Boys Don't
Cry' the tragically u n d e r r a t e d
debut single (I'll never understand
why this song wasn't a hit), then
the slightly uncomfortable 'Plastic
Passion'. The rest of the first side
is off "Three Imaginary Boys", and
includes '10.15 Saturday Night' and
'Subway Song', the latter being an
amazing track in which a walking
bass line, an echoing guitar and
isolated harmonica wails combine
to produce a superb atmosphere of
tension.
Side two features two tracks not
from "Three Imaginary Boys", to
wit 'Killing An Arab' and 'World
War'.
This makes an excellent intro-
duction to the music of the Cure, a
sort of e d i t e d h i g h l i g h t s , a n d
though it omits ' S o What' my
favourite Cure song, all the other
obvious tracks are featured.
The Return Of
The Durutti Column
(Factory Records)
I got hold of this album " o n the off
chance", and I've totally fallen head
over heels for it. T h e D u r u t t i
C o l u m n is basically Vini Reilly,
guitarist, writer, recluse and classic
ailing artist stereotype. H e has
p r o d u c e d a n a l b u m of m o o d y
evocative instrumental pieces
ranging from the infectious bubblie-
n e s s of 'Jazz' to the w i s t f u l ,
somehow unsatisfying 'Requiem
For A Dead Father'. He plays with-
out recourse to cheap tricks, or
massed batteries of effects, and the
music gains from this, achieving an
intimacy that puts most solo guitar
work to shame. Martin Hannet's
production is clear and sympathetic
and the bass and percussion fit easily
into the background.
It's the ideal album for playing
while sitting ona balcony soaking
up the sun, for going to sleep to,
for waking up to, or for holding a
conversation over. I love it.
Lenny Bruce At
Carnegie Hall
(3 record set)
This is not a new release, but it's
currently selling at Virgin for only
£3, making it the best buy of the
moment. It appears to be a straight
end to end recording of his act.
T h e e s s e n c e of L e n n y B r u c e
comedy is in the timing; he slows,
sets the b a c k g r o u n d , spots his
target and races suddenly in to the
p u n c h l i n e . T h e laughter is not
d i s p e r s e d i m m e d i a t e l y , for he
nearly always jumps straight back
in building up a wall of comedy
(sometimes reaching almost lunacy)
before smashing the whole to with
the punchline and usually leaving
y o u t h i n k i n g at the e n d . T h e
subject matter leaps from place to
place: r a c i s m , sex, a h e c k l e r ,
always sparked off from chance
remarks.
O n e of the most interesting
features of the album is the way
B r u c e d e a l s with h e c k l e r s by
setting them up as a target for the
laughter of the rest of the audience.
This almost ruthlessness being a
m a r k e d o p p o s i t e to his n o r m a l
selfless p h i l o s o p h y . T h e album
gives at least a hint of the enigmas
involved in the life of this remarkable
comedian. In additon to which it's a
damn good laugh.

Although in the States, so my
American friends tell me, books by
Edward Gorey are just "falling off
the shelves", they tend to be
extremely rare and hard to get
hold of in this country. It's nice,
therefore, to find a Gorey double
feature easily available in most
bookshops, at a reasonable price.
The only real way to find out
what Gorey does is to find a copy
of the book somewhere and flick
through it, but perhaps a word or
two of explanation might be useful.
Gorey draws in a very full, detailed
way, giving his drawings a strong
'Victorian' look. His subject matter
manages to attain the same kind of
period flavour. Dancing Cats is a
series of drawings, as the title page
says: "in which cats are shown
engaged, for reasons known only
to themselves, in a wide variety of
unlikely pursuits, many of them
being of a rather mysterious
nature." That just about sums it
up. The pictures are quite sweet,
which is rather unusual for Gorey;
his stories are usually either bleak
and tragic or display a really evil
sense of humour.
The second collection, Neglected
Murderesses, is more typically
Goreyesque, and consists of a
series of drawings with a caption to
each. Typical is: "Nurse J. Rose-
beetle tilted her employer out of a
wheelchair and over a cliff at
Sludgemouth in 1898." The accom-
panying illustration shows the
nurse standing at the top of the
cliff with an empty wheelchair.
Both sequences in the book are
worth looking at, although Neglected
Murderesses appeal more to my
macabre sense of humour (some of
them will be in this year's Rag
Mag, so watch out!). The book
makes a nice addition to any
collection, being the sort of thing
you can keep for years without it
losing its appeal, and is worth £1.50
of anybody's money.
