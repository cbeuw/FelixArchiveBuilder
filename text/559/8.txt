U n d e r N e w M a n a g e m e n t
W e l c o m e to issue 559 and m y first attempt at producing F E L I X .
Y o u will certainly find this issue full of news as it is the first one for
two months and is somewhat of a review of those months for
those of y o u that don't keep your ear to the ground. This is m y
first a n d last P G issue due to the fact that the ownership
of the Print Unit has just been transferred to the
U n i o n from the College, and we were forced to buy our o w n
materials. A s College generally pay through the nose for most
things, this necessitated the search for ne w suppliers. This took
four weeks negotiation, together with viewing numerous folding
machines (we n o w have a Faltex folder, a n absolute masterpiece
of engineering!)
Y o u will see that I have introduced o n e o r two new features; I
have launched 'Fishy Tales & Tasty M o r s e l s ' — an article which
gathers together little snippets of news, gossip, together with a little
subjective cynicism has been lacking for some time.
SAC
T h e less said the better. Captain Lindley (Domestic Secretary) and
the people w h o work in the S A C office are making complete and
utter dongos of themselves by the w a y they are overreacting to
our perfectly straightforward investigation of rumoured malpractice
within S A C (we have printed only fact, n o rumours). T h e sooner
Lindley a n d S A C stop acting as if they were the cast of a disaster
movie, the sooner this whole ridiculous affair will be sorted out.
I must apologise to any P G ' s w h o are mystified by o u r lead
story — w h y don't y o u phone u p C a p t a i n Lindley (int. 2216) a n d
ask him what it's all about. Best of British luck!
N e x t Issue
T h e next issue will be o n M O N D A Y , S e p t e m b e r 29 — the
freshers' issue. A l l clubs and societies should get their copy in by
September 7 ( same for Freshers' Fair posters) otherwise insertion
cannot be guaranteed — I want a brief holiday as well, y o u sods!
T h e normal copy deadline for Friday F E L I C E S will be 5:30p.m.
on the M o n d a y before. This deadline will be strictly enforced.
I bid y o u farewell for n o w ,
