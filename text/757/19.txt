Imperial College has recently
become part of LIVE-NET, one
of the world's first academic
interactive video networks.
British Telecom approached
the University of London with
a partly developed network
system, which they offered to
the University free of charge
(temporarily) in return for its
further development.
The University became
formally involved with the
project in March of this year.
In October the hardware
started arriving, and IC,
University College and Senate
House were connected up in
time for the 'Science for
Industry' Exhibition. Kings
College came on line more
recently, and it is hoped that
Queen Mary College, Royal
Holloway and Bedford New
College, and the University of
London Computer Centre will
be connected in the new year.
"the real question Is
going to be whether the
University gets enough
real use out of the system
to make Its development
worthwhile"
Those who attended the
exhibition were amongst the
first in the country to use the
'video telephone', and they
seemed to enjoy doing so.
There is no doubt that the
system works. The real
question is going to be
whether the University gets
enough real use out of the
system to make its
development worthwhile, or
whether British Telecom is
simply presented with a
marketable product at the end
of the day, with the
University's only reward being
the prospect of royalties and
the knowledge of a 'job well
done'.

"It will allow more and
better communication...
but only If users spend
time learning how to use
It effectively"
The main hope for the
system is that it will allow
more and better
communication between
people who are doing similar
work in different parts of the
University, and that it will
allow intercollegiate teaching.
There is no doubt that this is a
realistic objective, but only if
those who use the system are
prepared to spend time
learning how to use it
effectively.
At the moment the system
can give four pictures to any
college simultaneously. By
switching one can get as
many signals as are
transmitting, four at a time. At
the moment, all switching is
done manually, however,
designing software to make
the technician's job obsolete
(e.g., to keep one channel
always switching to whoever is
speaking for a more-than-four-
way conversation) is part of
the development which the
University has undertaken.
The LIVE-NET system is
state of the art technology:
this does not necessarily
mean, however, that it will
automatically benefit its users.
A bad or mediocre lecture will
not be improved by putting it
on LIVE-NET, indeed, some of
the restrictions of the medium
(such as having a lecturer who
is forced to stay seated, rather
than being able to run around
gesticulating) could make
lectures worse. Bad teaching
will be emphasised by the
medium, not hidden. So far,
the system has not always
been used to its user's best
advantage, simply through
insufficient thought about its
strengths and weaknesses.
A good example of this was
the first formal transmission
from IC, a postgraduate
Physics lecture. Students who
attended were from both
Imperial College and
University College, the UCL
students usually having to
travel across London for the
course. Instead, the students
simply made their way to the
TV studios in their respective
colleges. The lecture was
conducted in exactly the same
way as usual, except that
instead of seeing a lecturer
and a blackboard they saw
alternate pictures of the
lecturer's head and his
prewritten* notes. The lecturer
simply went through the notes
on the screen and the
students dutifully copied them
down. There was almost no
interaction between the
students and the lecturer
except for the occasional
query about a subscript and
one correction. Afterwards,
the students said that they
appreciated not having to
travel, but expressed doubts
about the legibility of the
writing on the screen and the
pace of the lecturer. They felt
that because he didn't have to
write anything down himself,
he didn't leave enough time
for them to take down notes.
It may be that this type of
lecture is more suited to video
tape than the video network.
Had the lecture been recorded
at IC in the morning and sent
to UCL in the afternoon, then
the UCL students would have
been able to stop the tape
when necessary. Any other
problems could have been
sorted out in a twenty minute
LIVE-NET tutorial or, better
still, a face-to-face tutorial
which probably would have to
take place anyway.

"the LIVE-NET system
should not be wasted on
things for which suitable
technology already
exists"
The LIVE-NET system
should not be wasted on things
for which suitable technology
already exists. It should be
used, as far as possible, for
truly interactive situations:
seminars; short committee
meetings; more discursive
lectures; intercollegiate
discussion groups for people in
the same discipline; etc. If
LIVE-NET must be used for
formal lectures, then
academics are going to have to

rethink their teaching style:
abandon their old practices for
some which are more
compatible with television (and
less compatible with sleep?).
Unfortunately many academics
are extremely reluctant to
change their styles c" teaching.
We can only hope that the
prospect of looking foolish on
TV will give them the impetus
to think harder about how to
give lectures in the studio.
The LIVE-NET system is
restricted by the fact that only
one group of people can use it
at once, i.e. there are only as
many hours available in the
'intercollegiate lecture theatre'
as there are in any other room
in the University. The LIVE-
NET theatre is also
considerably more expensive
to maintain. While it is, of
course, necessary to get
people to use the system, it is
more important in many ways
to make sure they use it
effectively right from the
beginning.
Those involved with the
LIVE-NET project are aware of
the problems related to the
system. Indeed, they have a
consultant whose job is to
deal with the basic problem of
making a man and machine
compatible. Perhaps their
biggest problem will come in
trying to make people want to
interact. One can only wish
the project the best of luck
and hope that LIVE-NET can
help to pull the University
together - and not die trying.
Opinion: A View To
Pacifism At Christmas
Industry' Exhibition in October.
It should not be taken from this
article that all Christians are
opposed to weapons, the MoT), or
whatever, but all Christians desire
peace in the world by some means,
and in this sense are pacifists, this
desire being firmly based on
biblical teaching.
It seems self-evident to many
people that there exists things
worth defending, worth dying for,
even killing for. Most people would
also agree that war, killing,
violence constitute maybe the
worst nightmare humans can
suffer, and that they should be
avoided as much as possible.
Contrary to most of us, who
rarely think where the line must be
drawn, Augustine of Hippo was a
thinker who asked when war can be
justified. For him, a war was
acceptable if non-combatants were
respected, if it were waged by a
legitimate authority for a good
cause against unjust aggression,
and if the benefit from fighting it
outweighed the destruction caused
by it. A war shouldn't be fought if
there was no chance of winning it.
St. Augustine's thinking, based on
4th Century Christianity still
reflects what we would call
reasonable requirements.
On the other a few people
throughout history have rejected
war, mainly on religious grounds.
Christians followed the 'turn the
other cheek' way of life until people
stopped burning them and feeding
them to the lions (around 300AD).
Love for enemies, forgiveness,
turning the other cheek: Is it just a
display of weakness and passivity,
like Nietzsche thought? Is it just a
bunch of good principles,
unapplicable and impractical in
this violent and dangerous world?
As a matter of fact, in the last
4000 years war has failed to
eliminate war from the Earth. The
next major war will probably
eliminate the human race as well as
wars. In the light of modern
warfare and of history as a whole
one can't dismiss non-violence as
naive or simply defeatist. Couldn't
it be precisely because of the use of
violence that after every war new
divisions immediately form, new
hatred and new interests drive
people to worse conflicts? Couldn't
there be something fundamentally
wrong with the idea that we can
make peace by endlessly preparing
more destructive weapons? Can we
really go on forever, shall they
never be used? More than a matter
of specific policies and politics, we
seem to be immersed in a society
which 'religiously' believes
violence is a reasonable, necessary
evil.
The answers are not easy. We all
feel we must protect our families,
friends, even our civilization; but
the way to do it becomes (as it
should) less and less obvious.
As a Christmas wish, may we
start searching for the way to
Peace: we who are responsible for
it.
