In a distant corner of Cheapskate
Ian Whygate sat planning his latest
publicity stunt with his two dumb
helpers, G M T (who was so stupid
that he was still in the first class at
Cheapskate infant school) and
Custard Johnson. Whygate had a
very clever plan. He and GMT and
Custard were going to creep around
all of the citizens dormitories in the
middle of the night and leave
cardboard cut-outs of Whygate
inside all the rooms which were
unlocked. Whygate giggled and
thought how clever he was. He
wanted to be next year's head citizen
in Cheapskate, and was carefully
planning how he would takeover
from the current head citizen, Ms
Plague. Whygate was easily the best
person to be the citizen's leader as he
had been to more committee
meetings than anyone else, and was
very good at running out crying in
order to get a lot of attention. In
particular, he was much better at
talking a lot than Alan Ego, the,
other candidate for the post of next
year's head citizen
Custard, meanwhile, was getting
bored with Ian Whygate's plans. He
did not like the idea of following
Whygate around with several
hundred cardboard cut-outs, and
decided to go and find his friend,
Kettle, to go for a drink in Northend
Bar. As usual when he wanted to
find Kettle, Custard rang the
FALLIX Office. "Is Kettle there",
said Custard when FALLIX Editor
Rabid Bones picked up the phone.
"Piss Off, Custard!", said Rabid
and slammed the phone down.
Rabid was not in a good mood. He
was in disgrace after falling asleep
whilst having tea with Mr and Mrs
TSB, the chancellor of Cheapskate
and his wife, at the Baron's Castle.
He did not like people using his
brand new office, including his staff,
and as usual was having an
argument with his Fairy Stories
Editor, Willhebe Goodforacolum-
ninch. Willhebe was drunk, after
going to the Belgium Club to find
some fairy stories. He had been
speaking to John Verycamp, the
leader of one of Cheapskate's bands
of elves, who always seemed to tell
Willhebe a lot of fairy stories about
himself. Willhebe was confused. He
did not undertand why Rabid did
not want him to write a story about
how good John Verycamp was at
gardening. Rabid sighed and
disappeared into the Print Room for
half a hour to clean the Printing
Press with Judith Largeamounts.
Meanwhile in the Citizens' office,
Bigbum, the Citizens' Chairman,
was sitting on Mummylonglegs'
knee. Mummylonglegs was the
Deputy leader of the citizens and
was in charge of the office while Ms
Plague was busy playing with
Hamster. Bigbum was sucking his
thumb and wailing "me want
cuddle" at regular intervals.
Mummylonglegs was trying to talk
to McNorthey, the Chief cook in
Cheapskate. She explained that she
wanted him to give her his new
"Quite Tasty" burger factory which
was making lots of money for the
Baron's coffers, but McNorthey just
laughed and gave Mummylonglegs
a sixpence for the citizens' Rug
collection. "But it's my room",
shrieked Mummylonglegs, banging
her fist on the table, and spilling a
cup of coffee all over Bigbum who
started to cry.
At that moment Ms Plague
rushed back into the Office, pushing
aside Gutters, the Citizens' Head
Bouncer, on her way in. She ran to
the phone and dialled the number.
for Dong, Fergie & Son, the
Cheapskate Rent Collector. "Hello,
can I help you?" said Dong sleepily
when he answered the phone,
waking from his afternoon nap.
"You idiot", screamed Ms Plague,
"you've given the citizens a house
with no roof!"
"Does it have four walls and a
floor, though?" replied Dong,
always on the defensive whenever
Ms Plague rang him.
"Don't argue, fix it immedi-
ately!" ordered Ms Plague. "I'm
going to ring the Baron's wife".
With that she slammed the phone
down.
Dong was worried. He went
downstairs to see Hardlyworthit,
the Cheapskate House Builder.
Hardlyworthit was very busy. He
had had lots of complaints about his
houses but couldn't get any of his
staff to mend anything. "I know",
said Hardlyworthit, "we can get
Whygate to mend all the houses.
Just give him a hammer and some
nails."
"Super", said Dong and went
back to finish his afternoon nap. His
peace was shortlived, though. No
sooner had he got back to his
comfortable office than the phone
rang again. Dong leapt to attention
when he heard the Baron's voice
over the phone. We'd like to come
and have a look around your office,
Dong", said Derek Dash, the new
Baron. Dong shuddered. The Baron
Himself was bad enough, but this
time Derek was bringing his
eccentric wife, Mad Dash. Dong
began to clear up his office but
before he could collect all the coffee
cups his phone rang yet again. This
time it was Arthur Michael, the
good but not very useful fairy. "The
Baron's coming to see you now",
chuckled Arthur Michael, gleefully.
Dong looked about him and
groaned. He could tell it was a
Tuesday
Will Dong get a dressing down
from the Baron
Will Willhebe Goodforacolumninch
ever sober up?
Will CustardfindKettle?
Will John Secretary appear in the
next instalment?
