STA - Service
To Students
STA is the most widely used travel organisation for students and
young people. Imperial College has one of the two offices in the
South West London area, which is used by 40 students every day.
FELIX interviewed Mark Fletcher, assistant sales manager for
South West London, who described the service STA is able to
offer.
In an effort to provide the type of
travel service students need, STA try
to employ staff who have travelled
extensively " i n the student
manner". Prior to taking up his
current job, Mr Fletcher spent a
year in South America after
working on land surveying projects
in Iraq. The office staff can always
find information about travelling
abroad—if they haven't visited your
destination themselves they can
easily phone up someone who has.
STA are offer significant
discounts on fares for students, and
can be up to 50% cheaper than their
competitors. The service is flexible,
allowing you to alter your timetable
where necessary, and unlike bucket
shops, S T A is government
backed—should the organisation
collapse, your ticket would still be
honoured. Discounts are available
on, for example, general airline
tickets, National Express coach
services in the UK, fen" crossings
and as a greyhound tickets. There
are also special offers, such as a trip
around the world for £800.
Because STA has offices all over
the world it is easy to change routes
and it is also feasible to use the
offices abroad as mail boxes. For
some trips it is necessary to book
well in advance, and fares are in
general very seasonal.
The office at IC attracts business
from other colleges in the area, such
as the RCA. Earlier this year the
office was moved from its old
position on the JCR to a new site
with a direct entrance from the
Sherfield walkway. As a result trade
has increased and academic staff are
now beginning to use the office. IC
Union benefits directly from STA-it
receives a rent payment of 1% of the
office turnover, with a minimum of
£2,500. In addition STA sponsor
some Union events, such as the offer
of a holiday for two in Paris at last
year's Rag Fete (won by ex-FELIX
Editor Hugh Southey). There are
also regular adverts in FELIX and
the Union Handbook.
The IC office has two permanent
members of staff; Suzie Roberts
(Manager) and Lesley Hing. The
office is open throughout the
summer period and can now be
phoned internally on 3906. For
group trips students should contact
the main branch in Old Brompton
Road, telephone 581 4751.
Tales from
the Holland
Club
by Nigel Hamster
When Union plaything Hugh
Southey decided to stand for a
sabbatical post at the end of the
third year of his four year Chemical
Engineering Course, several people
suggested he would have difficulty
getting used to academic work
again. Heroic Hugh appears to have
proved everyone wrong, however,
and has rediscovered his enthusiasm
for the subject. At the same time he
has been unable to fade gracefully
away from the Union scene. At the
Union Planning Group two weeks
ago, Hugh proudly presented his
master plan to save IC Union; with
twelve people around the table he
suggested that three working parties
be set up to look into different
aspects of Union affairs. Each group
should have, he explained, three or
four members so that they would be
able to "meet regularly" and "act
swiftly" (three timed four equals
twelve—brilliant, Hugh!). Hugh has
not fully recovered from eight weeks
with ICI over the summer, where he
discovered what a working party
was and decided that IC Union
needed one or two. Stunned by
Huge's mind-blowing plan, the rest
of the assembled cross section of the
Union office spent the next half an
hour deciding who should sit on
what working party and what
exactly each party should be
responsible for. At the end of
January, each working party (after a
lot of "acting swiftly") is going to
report back to the omnipotent UPG
which will then report to Council,
where all the people who sat on the
working parties will decide if they
want to do anything. A bureaucrats'
paradise—fantastic!
Ever-popular Refectory Manager
Rob Northey rarely misses an
opportunity to boost his profits.
Earlier this term honest Rob
persuaded the shift engineers to turn
up the heating in Southside, in order
to drag more custom down to the
bar. Since then Rob has been doing
his best to gain a reputation as a
College nice guy. After the RCS beer
festival he approached one of the
organisers and handed over £60—a
share of the enormous profit he had
made from the "QT" snack bar
during the day. Being such a
benevolent character, he added a
condition that this act of altruism
should be mentioned in the pages of
FELIX—I hope he's satisfied.
FELIX has not said very much
about the College's new accounting
system, which was introduced at the
beginning of August. Though
Sherfield was in chaos for several
weeks, it was impossible to find
anyone who would admit that
anything was amiss. "Problems with
the finance system? Don't know
what you mean. Everything's okay
here-just a few teething troubles in
the first few days, but you expect
that when you make as major a
change- as this." The teething
troubles included one member of
staff resigning in despair a few days
after the system was introduced, but
otherwise, no problems. Yes,
Terry—tell it to the Marines!
