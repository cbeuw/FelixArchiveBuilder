Yes! The
latest in a
long line of
exciting
journalistic
firsts in this
year's super
soaraway
"Felix" comes
the very latest
in total
designer
teabag
technology
It's True. Stapled somewhere within
this issue of "Felix" you will find,
absolutely free and without
obligation, your very own designer
teabag containing a mix of
prescision brewed and hand tooled
leaves fresh from the cutting edge of
tea technology; the famous
Honeypot Wholefoods Laborat-
ories.
Yes, you too can become a part of
the new craze that is tacking the
country by storm by owning what
will surely become the cult object of
the decadeâ€”and don't forget where
you saw it first!
Yes, here at "Felix" we have,
thanks to the kind generosity of Mr.
Honeypot of Honeypot Whole-
foods, been able to obtain these
teabags for no more than their
normal price! Such is the awesome
power of student journalism. Mr.
Honeypot is now recovering a major
trauma brought on by the thought,
although it was never suggested,
that he might be asked to supply the
teabags for free. We wish him well
and hope that all this free publicity
helps and comforts him through his
convalescence.
Chuck "Norman' Jardine,
notorious ex-teahead, snack bar
manager, chef, private detective,
psychiatrist and one time member of
wild regressive "rock" combo
"Norman and the Nutburgers",
found it hard to contain his
enthusiasm when intervieved early
today: "All the best. . . It was a
laugh. . . Steamboat. . . Scroggs...
What's the crack. . . Hey," he
exclaimed in a rare moment of
candour at which this reporter feels
priviliged to have been present.
"Yeah," he continued, "I used to do
a lot of tea... and biscuits." Nobody
laughed except snack bar
employees, fearful of future
employment prospects.
There are two things you can do
with your absolutely free and
without obligation teabag (an
exciting option for the analy
retentive amongst you) : Simply
take it to the Union Snack Bar and
hand it over to the staff member of
your choice. You may then claim
your complementary Xmas insult
by rejoicing in the salutation, "Ho
bloody ho," mispronounced with a
regionally disordered Tyne Teas
overbite. On no account should you
attempt to make tea with it
