Anthem For
Doomed
Youth
Dear Dave
Three years ago I was a young,
keen geophysicist with a four-year
degree and three year's industrial
experience behind me. As I wanted
to work in research, and had an
interesting project I wished to work
on, I came to Imperial College to do
a PhD.
In the three years I have been
here, I have come to know a lot of
people—undergraduates and
postgraduates, spread across most
departments of the College. Like
me, they were mostly young, and
mostly keen to become geologists or
physicists or mechanical engineers.
Now I find that I have a friend
with a first in physics who is
working as an accountant; two
friends with degrees in mechanical
engineering who have no intention
of ever working as mechanical
engineers; a number of friends
trying to complete PhDs in geology
for which they have totally lost
interest; and the list could continue.
I myself am on the verge of giving up
my PhD, only six months from
completion, because I am tired of
the constant struggle to get anything
done, of the barriers that constandy
appear before me. I have no
intention of working as a
geophysicist again.
What has happened to the young,
keen people?
Is Imperial College really doing
the best possible job for Science and
Technology?
Yours sincerely,

Of Today
Dear Dave,
I am writing in reply to Steven
Mercer's letter ( F E L I X 756)
concerning Hamlet Gardens. Mr.
Mercer seems to have been
misinformed.
I have contacted the landlords'
agents, through whom all the flats at
Hamlet Gardens are let. They tell
me that the flat to which Mr. Mercer
refers, which is in the basement, is in
fact a flat for only five. Space in
what used to be a double room has
been blocked off in order to create a
corridor to the cellar, thus making it
a single. Mr. Mercers' is a normal
six-person flat.
Furthermore, I am told that the
rent being charged for the basement
flat is in fact £150 per week—rather
more, per person, than we are
charging Mr. Mercer and his
flatmates.
It is true that the flaacross from
Mr. Mercer's is being let at a lower
rate. This is because it is unfurnished
and has been let to the same person
for a number of years on a protected
tenancy, which prevents the rent
being raised by more than a little
each year.
We asked the landlord to improve
the security arrangements as soon as
we heard there was a problem. They
reacted quickly in installing locks
and spring returns. New
entryphones, though, are expensive
and need to be costed before
installation. This takes time.
Pending installation of the
entryphones, the new locks were put
on the latch. On discovering the
locks, though, some of the
occupants of the flats activated
them and some others kicked down
the now-locked door. To prevent
further vandalism, we temporarily
suspended the locking of the doors
and Mr. Mercer complained. It
seems we can't win!
As far as keys are concerned, I can
only apologise on behalf of the
landlords if there has been any mix-
up concerning their issue. I will
pursue the matter with them. I
understand that the situation has
been fully remedied.
I am confident that Mr. Mercer,
now in full possession of the facts of
the matter, is in a better position to
appreciate the College's rent
structure and policies. If not, I
would be more than happy to meet
him and explain them to him. I hope
this clears up any misunderstan-
ding.
Yours ever,

When I Were
A Lad....
Dear David,
After last week's issue and its
article about my Dad's garage I
thought it time that I wrote in and
explained generally how that story
was born.
Whilst I was sitting on my first
Undergraduate Studies Committee
one of the first items to get through
was that of paying departments a
sum' of money from the fund
controlled by the committee to
allow them to send lecturers away
on courses. These courses would be
aimed at improving their knowledge
of their courses or improving their
lecture technique, or hopefully both.
Now silly little me thought that the
money the Undergraduate Studies
Committee was paying departments
would go to bringing in a
replacement; apparently this is not
so (quoted from the aforementioned
committee meeting). So I then asked
that if the money was just going to a
Department as an incentive
payment, why should we need to do
this at all. Surely it is in every
Department's best interest to keep
its lecturing staff up-to-date as
possible.
This is where the lesson according
to my Dad's garage comes in: My
Dad used to work for a garage
which employed fitters, sales staff
and receptionists. As was the
tradition in those days, each Works
trained some apprentices in
combination with lectures from the
local Tech. Also, before each new
range of cars came out garages who
sold the cars of this make were
invited to send staff on a
familiarisation course, for a small
sum of course. This meant that the
fitters could mend the new cars
before they came out, a bonus in a
competitive world such as ours.
However, the recession hit and
garages were no freer from its effects
than any other industry, the first
things to be cut were those that
required outlay before profit, i.e. the
continuing education process.
As I said, my Dad used to work in
a garage.
Applying the moral of this story
to Imperial College, Departments
shouldn't be saying "what's in it for
me", they should be insisting that all
lecturers be continually trained and
educated because in the long run
that is what people will notice, and
in the long run that is what will save
this College from the acts of any
government and perhaps the staff
here will never have to say I used to
work in a University.
I hope this dispells any thoughts
of premature senility that the author
of last week's third hand story was
toying with.

The One We
Had To Print
Dear David,
I am about to leave the College
after nearly thirty years looking
after the College archives, and
would like to express my
appreciation of the help that
students of the College have given to
the archives office. It would not
have been possible to undertake so
many exhibitions, displays, and the
organisation of professional and
private functions without this
assistance. FELIX editors and staff
have been particularly helpful, first
of all yourself, for doing so much
artwork for the Great Queen's
Tower project, and among previous
editors Pallab Ghosh, Mark Smith,
Hugh Southey and especially David
Rowe who also has this marvelous
talent for appearing at exactly the
right moment with a bottle of
champagne. I shall never forget also
how Steve Marshall's farewell issue
cheered me at a very black moment
in life. Two former chairmen of the
Social Clubs Committee, Dr. Frank
James and Robin Graham were of
immense help to me. Last but not
least I am most grateful to that well
known FELIX contributor and ex
Union President, SD Goulder, the
perfect major-domo. As a member
of the FELIX Club I hope I will see
something of you all in the future.
VIVAT ET FLOREAT FELIX!

NUS Debate:
No Case For
Reaffiliation
Dear Dave,
What could IC possibly gain from
joining the NUS? What would we
get in exchange for the valuable
clubs which we would have to
sacrifice to join that organisation?
If, as you say, ICU has an opinion to
express (and the question here is not
whether it does or not), does it need
to a member of the NUS to express
it? Surely not. Has the NUS not
proven itself to be the most
inefficient student organization in
Great Britain? Any organisation
that spends 90% of its budget on its
annual conference (leaving only
10% for possible worthwhile
activities which may have a slightly
higher chance improving our lot as
University students) cannot
honestly claim to be doing its best
for the students it supposedly
represents. What are the NUS's
most outstanding achievements so
far? The only one I can think of is
one that has lasted 7 years—since
1979 they have sat idly by, watching
students' grants as they are reduced
more and more in real terms. What
have they done to try to prevent
this? Nothing. Not only has the NUS
done nothing for Joe (or Jane)
student, it has actually done more to
damage the public image of students
than any other organisation. It is
they who have given the public the
idea that a university student is
automatically some kind of ultra-
left wing dirty hippy who spends all
his time going on protest marches
instead of staying at home and
studying, and who spends all his
grant money (which was provided
by the tax-payers) on nose-rings and
hair dye. This is the image we
University students have, and we
have the NUS to thank for it. Let us
ask ourselves again, what would we
possibly gain by joining the NUS?
Yours sincerely,
llastair Seymour
