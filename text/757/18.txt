Feature FELIX, Wednesday December 10th 1986 1 9
Those Who Would
Be President
Briefcases and Filofaxes will be
producing ugly bulges in Christmas
stockings for many, but budding
Presidential candidates will be
getting highlights put in their hair,
contact lenses and a new pair of
flares. It's only December and the
race is on us once again as to who
can gain credibility as quickly as
possible without actually achieving
anything.
Whose are the faces that will be
adorning the walkway, and pushed
under every hall door in February?
Spotting the Presidential candidate
is an easy task. The subject will first
express an irrepressible need to
speak at UGMs, no matter how little
they know about a topic. The next
step is to try to get on as many
committees as possible, even if it
means crashing them in the first
place. The final, fatal stage is to
write long articles in various College
magazines on their current
province, be it as Internal
Lavatories Officer or C C U Vomit
Monitor. When this stage is reached
there is no turning back, and usually
leads to permanent emotional scars,
such as actually becoming
President.
FELIX presents its own dossier
on who has developed this
frightening syndrome around
college this year.
Ian Howgate's
cardboard cutout was
not too keen on being
photographed.
Diagnosed as suffering from an
acute form of committee
attendance, Ian 'Showroom Dummy'
Howgate has shown such keenness
to be elected that he has even sent
apologies for his absence to Exec
meetings. His need to speak on any
matter as long as it is about student
residence or security has led to him
making up totally fictitious stories
about Weeks Hall and then
apologising for the situation in
public.
However this ability to keep quiet
has meant that his soon-to-be-
created cardboard cut-out replica is
currently one of the favourites for
the Presidency. Its combination of
silence and inability to write makes
it incapable of embarrassing itself
and has been shown to be more
popular as it has been invited to all
committee meetings in the Union.
In a last ditch bid to
save last year's RCS
Dinner, Tom Melliar-
Smith does a hopeless
impression of Willie
Rushton.
Another approach to the
Presidential campaign is to take as
many first years as possible in order
to gain fame and votes—often using
false registration slips to prove they
are really students (one of the little
rules that stops people like Ronald
Reagan and Papa Doc Duvalier
from ever becoming President).
The current exponent of this
technique is Tom 'Fallguy' Meliar-
Smith who has managed to spend
his time in Life Science I, Pretending
To Be Life Sci I Again Though Not
Really A Student At All, and now
Geology I. However during his
'enforced holiday' he held down the
post of RCS Hon Sec is spite of a few
rules banning that sort of thing—so
formalites like 'good academic
standing' in order to be a sabbatical
shouldn't bother him too much.
Due to a mix-up at the
chemists we are unable
to bring you Hugh
Southey's bum, but we
think you'll find the
palm trees we were sent
instead far more
attractive.
There are certain advantages with
already having been a sabbatical, a
la Hugh 'Bigbum' Southey one-time
FELIX Editor and now holder of
the maximum number of legitimate
committee posts himself. Bigbum
seems to believe that the art of being
a good Presidential candidate is to
sit on any committee he can,
without actually achieving
anything. Only two things stand in
his way: his constant gyratory
motion makes it impossible to take
clear photographs of him for his
election publicity, and secondly
Jackie might not let him stand.
Incorrigible rubber
fetishist, Chas Jackson
tries on his latest outfit.
A no less senior compatriot in Chem
Eng is Chas 'Grandpa' Jackson,
• whose extraordinary keenness to be
Publicity Officer—hot favourite as
the naffest job in the Union together
with Ordinary Member of Reactor
Safety Committee—is curious to say
the least. However, his interest in
posters may extend just as long as
February when his own face starts
appearing on the Walkway. He can
cite as previous experience his less
than friendly attitude to people
caught borrowing stools from the
Snack Bar.
Simon Singh in his
famous impersonation
of Dame Edna Everage.
Backing the CCU corner is Simon
'Short Skirt' Singh, so named
because of his habit of getting
various Rocky Horror events
organised just so that he can show of
his legs at them, or it might be due to
Christine extolling the virtues of
dressing up in drag that has brought
this on. We may have seen the birth
of a new form of sabbatical
credibility.t His other qualification
for the job is his political
ambivalence, otherwise known as
hypocrisy. Whilst backing the thrice
failed student, Tony Spencer as
Broadsheet Editor, he was
somewhat less at home with the idea
of having Tom Meliar-Smith as
Hon Sec last year despite his similar
situation.
