The Shadow Syndicate: Blood Of
Angels: The Ideal Christmas Party?
It is hard to know how to start
reviewing Blood of Angels by the
Shadow Syndicate. There is no
single thing one can say that gets to
the bottom of this strange play.
Anyone who is unsure just how
innovative and powerful fringe
theatre can be should try to catch
this play before Christmas. It is
breathtaking.
On the outside it sounds a little
preposterous: Oscar Wilde's
Salome; light 50's music, prophecy,
intrigue. It sounds like a vague
melee of unconnected ideas but it is
nothing of the sort.
Instead we are treated to a play
that has been constructed with great
intelligence and the utmost in
imagination. Wilde's risky 'Salome'
(too hot for the English stage to
handle in its time) is the key or
interior. The exterior is a setting of
the 1950's complete with the band
evocative music of that period.
There is a similar duality in these
two as the plot unfolds,
investigating the characters and
their relationships in a bizarre
probing ritual manner that involves
the acting of Salome. The
e l
7
programme notes describe this as a
surreal therapy session.
Everything is provocatively
shrouded in vagueness and
'unclarity' where strong currents of
portentous prophesy flow
underneath. The high drama is
arresting, heightened by ingeneous
techniques all serving to extend the
frontiers of what is taking place in
the small room.
To single out actors would be
pointless, the production is very
much a 'syndicate' production.
Each of them communicates a
haunting scene of what they are
doing. Whether the audience
understands or not they seem to
totally understand the esoteric
nature of their play. Credit for its
conception goes to Jon Pope and
Peter Granger Taylor, the latter also
writing recent Syncicate hit 'Between
the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea'.
You would not be disappointed in
this play. From the moment you are
ushered into the small theatre until
the moment you leave you will be
witness to a production of total
theatricality. The adjective 'camp'
could be applied if you wished but
not in any derogatory sense—more
in envy of the brilliantly devious
minds who created this stage flight
of the imagination.

Records
Having proved what a successful
style Spandau Ballet have, their
record label would obviously be
requesting more of the same, but the
material needs to slightly different
from previous albums, which I
believe that on 'Through the
Barricades' is, for the most part.
Little has changed in the musical
arrangement; we still hear the crisp
and always-in-tune lead vocals,
interspersed with the ubiquitous
sax, but the guitar on 'Cross the
Line' is that little bit heavier, and on
several tracks, the melody is much
more adventurous, and less
'formula'. The songs are all pretty
long, and most have one of those
quiet 'take-a-rest' bits half way
through, which is particularly
effective on 'Man in Chains', with
the bongos in the background.
Possibly the strongest tracks other
than the title are 'How Many Lies',
X
with an OMD-like vocal hum intro
leading into a slow, but powerful
sounding track, and 'Swept', which
is a quieter ballad-type number,
with plenty of acoustic piano.
Frankie Goes to Hollywood on
the other hand, have been so
incredibly successful that they stand
little chance of maintaining the
fantastic success they so quickly
found. The songs on their
'Liverpool' album are in general a
lot better thought out before they
reach the Trevor Horn big sound
department than was the case on the
last LP, but somehow have lost that
cult appeal. With one exception,
'Watching the Wildlife', the tracks
are the same combination of driving
beat/bass and big-sound synth
Chorus that go down well on radio
and in discos, although you can't
easily dance to 'For Heaven's Sake',
leaving little else to recommend it.
However, the acoustic piano on
'Watching the Wildlife' does a lot to
soften the sound, and is a real
example of rhythmic music, rather
than musical rhythym.
Bucks Fizz have spent five years
trying live down the fact that they
won Eurovision, and would have
succeeded with their current album,
'Writing on the Wall', if it wasn't for
the 'two men, two women, all sing
together' format of their chorusses
which is a dead giveaway of their
kinship with the unspeakable
Swedish quartet. Their current
sound is characterised by modern
sounding digital percussion, and
quite strong solo vocals during the
verses, and a few new ideas, such as
the harmonica on 'The Company
you Keep', which also includes the
soul-type bass that Paul Young
record's always used to feature.
'Love in a World gone Mad'
actually sounds quite 5-star like in
parts, but despite their efforts, I
don't think they're sufficiently
detached from 'Making your mind
up' to appeal to a wider audience.
My favourite track was 'Magical'
which is rhythmically very strong, in
fact several tracks could stand up in
a disco well if it weren't for peoples
pre-conceptions.
F i n a l l y , check-out that
indescribable Christmas record
from the Baron-Knights.
