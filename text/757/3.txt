QT Revisited
The Students' Union is pressing the
College for control of the QT snack
bar in the Sherfield building, in
compensation for an expected
£12000 loss in conference revenue
should the College's plans go ahead.
Meanwhile, the academic staff are
protesting about the College's
intention to convert the Senior
Common Room into a refectory,
and are particularly concerned that
they had not been properly
informed of the proposals.
In a document presented to the
College last week, the Union
pointed out that the loss of space in
the Junior Common Room will
substantially reduce their takings
when the JCR is let,to conferences
during vacations. They estimate
that further losses would be
incurred by reduced sales of books
to conferences.
The matter was raised at a public
meeting called by the Rector,
Professor Eric Ash, on Tuesday
lunchtime, during which College
Secretary John Smith explained the
need for more refectory facilities. He
pointed out that the number of
students using the refectories had
shown an unexpected increase this
year of 1400 above the predicted
figure.
Hence, said Mr. Smith, the
College's original plan to swap the
JCR with the Sherfield buttery
could no longer take place. "We can
go back to the old proposal if
College demands, but I won't be
responsible if it goes wrong," he
said. He added that the congestion
in the JCR was the result of the
Balls
Pocketed
Fourteen coloured balls were stolen
from the Snooker Club in the Union
Building last Tuesday. The theft
follows an incident on November
14th after the Guilds' Carnival when
two red and two black balls were
stolen and two windows broken.
Club President David Rhodes has
appealed for the return of the balls
with the promise that 'no questions
will be asked'. The Club Junior
Treasurer, Richard Wiles, said that
the Club would be looking at the
possibility of buying a new set of
balls, however,- in the meantime it
may be forced to close down one of
'he tables. The Club is also
considering closing an hour earlier
to avoid bar closing time.
College not forseeing that users of
QT would use the seating space in
the JCR.
The issues were again discussed at
a meeting of the Refectory Users'
Committee later on Tuesday
afternoon. F E L I X reporters
approached Mr. Chalmers, the
Senior Assistant Secretary, for
permission to observe the
procedures, but were denied access
to the meeting.
The Academic Staff Assembly
meanwhile has written to the Rector
complaining that they had only
found out about the moves
accidentally and expressing the need
for staff to be able to entertain
visitors and hold confidential
conversations.
Going For A Singh
The Royal College of Science Union
will be holding an "Extraordinary
General Meeting" today. The
meeting has been called at the
request of more than 50 members of
RCSU, who have signed a petition
criticising President Simon Singh's
leadership of the Union.
The petition was delivered to
RSCU Hon. Secretary Guy Perry
last week. The students are
concerned that Mr Singh has made a
series of decisions without the
proper backing of the Union. In
particular he has been attacked for
not calling enough Union General
Meetings or General Commitee
Meetings. Mr Singh has also
dismissed Broadsheet Editor Tony
Spencer, who is not a current
student, without consulting either
the rest of the executive or the
General Committee. This was a
decision which Mr Singh does nol
strictly have the authority to make
Several senior RCS students have
signed the petition, including Sunnv
Bains of Physics 2, who proposed
Mr Singh for the post of President in
last years election.
The petition was organised by
Paul Bailey who told FELIX why he
was protesting against Mr Singh. He
said that Mr Singh had made a lot of
decisions that were relevent to
RCSU, but was failing to tell the
Union about them. He added that
Mr Singh had tried to take over the
role of Entertainments Chairman in
the last few weeks, instead of letting
others get on with their jobs.
RCSU Vice President Judith
Hackney said later that she and Guy
Perry felt that Mr Singh has acted
very hastily in making a decision
.about Tony Spencer.
Silent
Nightline
West London Nightline suffered an
unexpected financial setback this
year, due to an oversight by last
year's ICU Deputy President Dave
Kingston. This could cost Nightline
£675, which would threaten training
weekends and factilites for
operation. Imperial College
normally pays £3,000 directly to
Nightline, which is in addition to
£675 provided by ICU. This year,
the sum paid by College was paid
through the Union as a trial
arrangement, so increasing the
Union subvention, on paper. Mr
Kingston did not fully understand
where his nose was and so set the
Union contribution at £3,000, so
effectively cutting Nightline's
funding by £675. The error was not
noticed until recently, and as this
year's budget has already been
fixed, the Union will either have to
make a contingency claim or rewite
the budget if they wish to rectify the
mistake.
Holbein
House
Banned From
Dinner
Students from Holbein House have
been banned from the College
Christmas Dinner on Thursday
because of alleged bad behaviour
during last year's event. The ban
was imposed in an attempt to
prevent the recurrance of excessive
drinking and food fights by some of
the residents. Ten students who
were not from Holbein have also
been banned for disruptive
behaviour.
One Holbein resident had to be
escorted home during last year's
dinner, and another vomited on the
table.
Commenting on the ban, House
Warden Barry Saunders said that
although he wasn't completely
surprised by the move, he had not
received any official College
notification beforehand. He also
pointed out that a number of
students had only been told that
they had been banned after buying
tickets, and that last year's problem
could have been prevented if alcohol
had been sufficently controlled.
The Holbein Students Residence
Committee will be holding their
own function as an alternative to the
dinner.
