ICCAG - the Soup Run
The Imperial College Community
Action Group (ICCAG) organises a
soup run which takes place every
Thursday. The soup run takes
bread, soup, biscuits and tea to
homeless people in London.
Society's social conscience
manifests itself as numerous 'hand
outs' of food, drink, clothing etc.
made available to London's
homeless. These are often provided
by 'professional' soup runners who
call at unsocial hours and are
usually abrupt. Probably the most
important thing about our soup run
is not therefore the food we bring,
but that we bring a group of
students willing to listen and talk.
We leave Weeks Hall every
Thursday evening at about 9.15 pm,
taking a union van full of people and
food to Lincoln's Inn Fields and
Embankment.
We return to College by 11.30pm.
This term support for the soup run
from students has not been as good
as it could have been, so I hope that
people reading this will consider
joining us next term. I don't know
anyone who has ever regretted
coming, neither is it a regular
commitment.
I would especially ask that
anyone in London over the
Christmas holiday would come on
the soup run on the 18th of
December which will be our last run
before next term.
Thousands of people in London
are homeless. These vary from
teenagers who have run away from
home, to ex 'professionals' who
have dropped out of the rat race. A
lot have had nervous breakdowns
and are thus unable to cope with
'normal' society. All these people,
having no fixed address, are stuck in
a trap from which it is almost
impossible to escape. You can't get a
job without an address etc. Last
week, one of the homeless people I
was talking to gave me a copy of this
poem, which he had adapted from a
song 'The streets of London':
You've heard the song
- Maybe taken in each word
Yet I've seen beneath the surface
And every note Tve heard.
For on the streets of London
Where the lonely tread each day
I have slept upon the flagstones
And tried to will my cares away.
I have met the old lady
With a carrier bag her home
I have followed the old man
Now so lost and so alone.
So I can tell you of the loneliness
And of the sun that doesn't shine
Yet I've seen you in the street,
Could a song ever change your mind?

Christian Union: A discourse on Death
Death. Not a very nice word really.
It's not the sort of thing that you
want to talk about in polite -
c o m p a n y . Tends to stop
conversations and cause awkward
silences. Death has no respect for
age, colour, religion or sex; it comes
to us all, no matter who we are. It is
not sexist or racist, nor does it hold
any political views, and it is truly
cosmopolitan. (Wot?-Ed). Problem
is that we want to avoid it. Everyone
who has ever lived and, dare I say it,
anyone who ever will, is going to
meet death. (Td never have worked
that one out-Typesetter)
All pretty morbid so far, isn't it?
Well, there is some more cheering
news. No, I haven't found an elixir
of life! Well, not exactly. However,
there is one man who is greater even
than death. Just before you start to
switch off at the sound of another
funny farm case, take a fresh look at
Jesus. Well, the last time you took a
look, you were probably an angel in
the church nativity play or half
asleep in the school chapel. Jesus
was the one who said "I am the
resurrection and the life" and then
raised a man from the dead. Most
incredible of all, he himself rose
from the dead. Fairy stories! It's
probably the best attested fact in
history if you will bother to look.
Apathy won't do here; if Jesus rose
from the dead, then isn't it about
time that you started listening to
what he actually had to say, rather
than what you think he said. How
do you find out? Pick up any of the
gospels in the New Testament of the
Bible—Matthew, Mark, Luke or
John—and read an historical
biography about the man around
whom history pivots!
Cookery
Jasmine
Smith
Shock, horror, gasp, faint! There
was a response to this column's first
appearance. Thanks for pointing
out the misdirected arrow on one of
the diagrams. My correspondent
has sent in a recipe for boiled eggs
with bread soldiers made using a
non-automatic kettle, a cup and
teaspoon. I shall not go into the
procedural details of how to achieve
the best results, but shall leave it to
you, the reader, to rush out and in a
truly scientific manner attempt to
discover the fastest and easiest way
of obtaining the desired end
product.
Let us move on to a different
problem. One which has dogged the
human community for hundreds, if
not thousands of years. A problem
close to many people's hearts. It is a
subject which causes severe anguish,
arouses deep sympathy, is not
spoken lightly of but treated with
great respect and if someone can
think of a way to solve it, they'd be
stinky-poo rich overnight. Yes, it's
the dreaded HANGOVER!
Take a breather while you recover
from the shudders this word
produces. Those of you who have
no experience in this matter can
obtain blow by blow accounts from
your friends. Instead we shall turn
our beady eyes to an aspect which
has exercised even the most able
brains: THE CURE
No, not the rockband, but the
release from the hangover. This
topic is surrounded by an air of
mystery and mystique. The
imagination throws up images of
toad's spittle, bat's urine and other
such delicacies. People gawp in awe
at whoever has the audacity to
suggest that they know the answer
to this ailment. I say poppycock,
balderdash and fiddlesticks! We all
kYiow the answer—don't drink. But
to most of us this would make social
intercourse a trial instead of a
pleasure.
This is the time of year when
many will be suffering from the
excesses of the night before. In order
that we can continue the scientific
moulding of our brains, I have
compiled a list of the "cures" which
frequently are suggested as dead (!?)
certs:
—drinking something alcoholic
first thing next morning (surely this
just makes you legless again ?)
—drinking lots and lots of water
before collapsing in a pathetic heap
on one's bed.
—drinking lots of orange juice
because it's liquid and contains
sugar (then why doesn't hot, sweet
tea work?)
They all seem to involve drinking!
Is this significant? I think we should
be told. Happy experimenting and I
look forward to your reports next
term!

Two Medals
On Sunday 30th November, the
Orienteering Club went to Epping
Forest to compete in the London
championships. Despite the bitterly
cold weather and muddy condition,
.two members won medals. Mr.
Bruce Ainsworth (Geology 3) won
the M19A silver medal and Miss
Clare Caulfield (French Institute 2)
won the W19 bronze medal. This
upheld the excellent record of the
club, in the London championships.
The other members all completed
their courses, whether running,
walking or even swimming(!) with
the incentive of liquid refreshment
at the end (ie the orange juice!)
Amnesty
Vigil
Today (December 10th) is United
Nations Human Rights Day. To
mark the occasion IC Amnesty
along with LSE Amnesty are
holding a vigil outside the Soviet
Embassy in support of IC's adopted
Prisoner of Conscience, Ivan
Starovoit. Starovoit was imprisoned
in the USSR for peacefully
practising his religion as a Jehovah's
Witness. The vigil will be from 2pm
to 5pm. Please come along with us
and show your concern for human
rights. We will be leaving the Royal
Albert Hall steps (on Prince
Consort Road) at 1.30. If you want
to get involved in Amnesty's
campaigns we meet every Tuesday
evening at 5.30 in the Brown
Committee Room on the top floor
of the Union Building.
Film Soc
Premiere
Last Thursday night, Imperial
College Film Society had its first
film evening. One hundred and sixty
students packed Physics LT1 to see
' C l o c k w i s e ' starring John
Cleese—an uproarious tale of one
day in a school headmaster's life,
when his whole world falls apart
around him.
The film was brilliant—
absolutely hilarious, and with the
audience joining in, clapping and
cheering towards the end, a good
evening was had by all.
Next term, Film Society hopes to
hold more evenings of the same sort,
on a regular basis. Next time
refreshments may be provided, and
the second projector will be
working, to bring a more
professional air to the show.
If you would like to know more
about Film Society, or would like to
become a member, please come
along to the Union Lounge at
.^..30pm this lunchtime.
