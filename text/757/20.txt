UL Win
Tournament
FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 22
Tough Opposition
On Saturday 29th November, the
University of London Korfball team
travelled to Nottingham for the last
tournament before Christmas as
reigning champions.
The U L second team led the way
with three victories to win their
group fairly comfortably. However,
due to the rules of the competition,
they were unable to compete further
and this prevented a possible all-
London final.
Five teams were in the second
group including the three strongest
in the country. UL started well with
emphatic victories over the weaker
teams of Nottingham, 4—0, and
Sheffield, 4—1. After this, the
games became a lot more tense, and
with strong defences, scoring
became a lot harder.
The next game, against Oxford,
was very tight but U L eventually
struggled to victory, 3—2, mainly
due to better long range shooting.
This led to a group-deciding match
against arch-rivals Brighton which
was won 2—1 after an all-out effort
for revenge following last week's
defeat.
A joint Lancaster and York team
were the opponents in the semi final,
and after taking an early 1—0 lead,
they seemed capable of holding U L
to this score until two well worked
plays in the last three minutes both
produced goals and hence gave
victory to UL, 2—1.
The final was a rematch against
Oxford who had thrashed their
semi-final opponents. Both defences
played tight, controlled korfball and
neither side seemed capable of
scoring. With only five minutes left,
the referee awarded a very dubious
penalty to Oxford, and when scored
it seemed to have settled the match.
But after an excellent long range
equaliser from UL, the Oxford
defence seemed to fall apart and UL
scored again to win the match, and
tournament, 2—1.
In the three tournaments entered
this term, U L have won two and
been losing finalists in the other.

Badminton
Successes
In UAU
In the last two weeks badminton
players from IC have achieved two
remarkable victories in ladies and
mixed doubles.
The most notable victory came
last weekend when the badminton
club sent a team to represent the
College at the U A U Individuals
Championships. Robin Martin and
Julie Goodeve stormed through to
the Ladies Doubles Final by
crushing anything that stood in their
way. In the quarter finals they easily
beat Loughborough's first pair, who
boasted half of last years winners,
15:6 15:2, and in the semi-final they
annihilated the number two seeds
from Sheffield 15:2, 15:1.
The final, against another
unseeded pair from Birmingham,
was a closer and tougher match but
the IC pair were never in any real
trouble. They won the title 15:12,
15:10.
There were other good
performances that weekend, again
featuring Robin and Julie. In the
mixed doubles Robin reached the
quarter finals with Sean Mulshaw,
and Julie reached the last 16 with
Graham Scott. In the Ladies singles
Sue Yates played extremely well to
reach the last 16 and only narrowly
lost 11:8 11:6 to miss out on the
quarter final.
It was a memorable weekend.
The other success took place the
week before in the Hammersmith
and District Badminton Tourna-
ments. Four pairs from IC took
part—two in both the mens and
mixed doubles. The standard of
badminton was pretty good and
although three pairs did not qualify
for the semi finals, it was Robin
Martin and Sean Mulshaw that
found themselves in the semi finals
of the mixed.
That match proved to be the most
testing game all day. Having built
up a commanding lead the
opposition then began a comeback,
and little by little the lead was
reduced. However, the IC pair kept
their composure and won the game
21:16.
In the final it was a similar story.
Having easily won the first game
15:4 (the best of three match) the
second game was conceded 15:10.
The deciding game was consider-
ably closer but Robin and Sean
managed to clinch the title 15:12.
At the second meeting of the
London Colleges ski league, we
enjoyed some good racing against
tough opposition. The Imperial first
team, Victor Misawa, Kate Finch,
Ivor Gillbe, Mark Schmidt and
Mike Johnston, reached the final
only to be narrowly beaten by UCL.
Our other two teams had a good
evening's racing coming slightly
lower down the results.
The team played in the South East
U A U tournament at Essex
University on Saturday 15th of
November in Colchester. Despite
this being the first time the team had
played together we performed well
and, with some luck, could have
qualified for the knock out stage of
the tournament.
We played 3 games and won 1.
The first two games, against Kent
and the home team Essex, we lost
narrowly by 55—59 and 56—60. In
In the past few weeks we've had
three matches and not surprisingly
we didn't win one. However, in the
two against Southhampton we had
moral victories. That is we scored
points for the first time this season.
This first match was a 5—5 draw
that we should have won whilst the
second was lost 8—2 after we looked
like getting a draw. The worst
performance of the week was by
Capital Coaches on Wednesday
when they turned up seventy
minutes late. This meant that when
Despite the racing debut of our
Club Treasurer, Clare Murphy, we
still need female skiers to complete
the teams.' So if there are any good
female skiers who wish to race,
contact us through the union pigeon
holes or come to one of our
meetings.
Next race is in the Spring Term on
Saturday 17th January at Hemel
Hempstead.
our final game we beat Surrey by
44—33.
It was a good performance and
we were unfortunate to lose two
games by such a small margin.
Our first league game was played
against UCL on Thursday 27th. the
game was very competitive but we
always had the edge over UCL and
after we weathered a period of
intense UCL pressure in the second
half, we were comfortable winners
by 76—74.
we arrived at Tolworth we had
already lost the match 10—0.
Special mentions go to Paul
Gaines, Andy Rayner and Nicky
Fletcher for service beyond the call
of duty.
There is no bowling for the rest of
the year but next term bowling will
start again on the second
Wednesday. If you've never come
bowling before then now is the time
to start because you'll have your
grant cheque waiting to be spent.
