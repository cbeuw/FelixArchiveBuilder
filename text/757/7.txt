Featura FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986
through with it, filling in ribs,
making right arm-bones to match
the original left-arm bones, and
enabling the structure to stand up,
about eighty percent of the
dinosaur's frame may eventually go
on show—in another year or so.
There are still three large blocks
out of fifty-five to be opened, and
the remnants of the rock matrix to
be cleared in a stop-start process
when at any moment the sand-
blaster might find i t s e l f
d i s i n t e g r a t i n g new b o n e .
Apparently one can tell when bone
is reached by changes in colour and
hardness—the fossil consists of the
actual bone with certain minerals
dissolved out and replaced by
for fish in the swamps of a river
flood-plain (sandstones and shales
in the area show ripple marks) or,
less romantically, rootled in the rib-
cages of carcasses for the odd
delicacy. The fish teeth in the region
of her stomach aren't conclusive
evidence, but the acid-etched fish
scales found with them are. She has
twice as many teeth in her lower jaw
(sixty-four) as most dinosaurs, and
each is so finely serrated that the
jaggedness only shows under a
microscope—both features of a fish-
eater.
'Claws' also had very strong arms
for a dinosaur of her type,
suggesting that she could quite
easily have strolled along on four
legs. The extra-large claws, three
times as large as the rest of her
fingers, may have been on either
hands or feet, and were probably
used both to attack and defend.
Milner points out that grizzly bears
use their claws to side-swipe passing
fish.
So picture, if you will, a fifteen-
foot, one-and-a-half ton reptilian
with a crocodile smile, ambling
leisurely on her hind legs along a
river bank. Now and then she drops
bear-like to all fours, waits a while,
then suddenly darts a heavily-
clawed hand into the water to come
up with a fish which she proceeds to
swallow with enjoyment, her
armoury of teeth making short work
of its struggles. Also on the scene are
a couple of plant-chewing
iguanodons. Swarms of insects,
among them the recently discovered
giant dragonfly, haunt the air. Add
the appropriate vegetation,
horsetails and cycads, and there you
have it—the world of 'Claws'.
Baryonyx walkerei:
'Baryonyx" comes from the Greek
words meaning 'heavy claw';
'walkerei' honours its discoverer,
W Walker.
others. More often it seems that
what is needed is a little imagination
and a lot of anatomy.
The biggest lack in this skeleton is
the tail, which probably parted
company with 'Claws' when after
she died her body was washed
d o w n s t r e a m in a f l o o d .
Unfortunately there are no signs of
how she died, or even whether she is
a 'she' or a 'he'. But the remains
already studied have told a great
deal about the lifestyle of 'Claws'.
Indeed, they've shown such vast
differences from anything so far
seen that Charig was prepared to
'stick my neck out and say that this
is probably the most exciting find in
Europe this century'. Stirring stuff,
for an old fossil— in this case all of
240 million years old; it's the only
relatively complete dinosaur find in
the world from the rocks of the
lower Cretaceous.
People whose imagination was
caught by the nickname 'Claws'
may be in for a disappointment.
True, she was one of the
therapods—bipedal, carnivorous,
Tyrannosaurus rex-type dinosaurs.
But her skull was definitely not that
of a hunter and killer. Her slender
snout, swelling at the end like that of
a crocodile and loosely jointed so
that she could probably waggle its
tip, means that she probably hunted
