Featura FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 6
On Wednesday November 27th Alan Charig and
Angela Milner of the Natural History Museum finally
announced details of a new type of dinosaur. The
FELIX Geology division, headed by Kamala Sen,
went to investigate.
Claws
'Claws' has at last been offically
christened. Her (or his) real name is
now Baryonyx walkeri, say the
experts, and she's the founding
member of a new dinosaur family,
Baryonychidae.
Three years, you might think, is a
long time to take deciding what to
call a set of old bones. For it was in
1983 that a plumber and eager
amateur fossil hunter, William
Walker, stumbled over the first
traces in a clay pit in Surrey. The
foot-long claw he found hinted at
drama and fury in the prehistoric
world, and at further dramatic
revelations to come. It's been a long
wait for more news.
But to me it's a miracle that the
creature has been classified in less
than a decade. Think it's hard
putting together the sky on a jigsaw
puzzle? You should have a go at this
jigsaw. The palaeontology lab at the
Natural History Museum looks like
a busy town centre—just after it's
been hit by a rather large bomb.
Fragments of bone and mud
everywhere. Tangles of wire and
pipes at strange angles, glaring lights
and mechanical noises...
To get back to the point—
'Claws'. She (or he) is lying in what
must be hundreds of thousands of
pieces over this disaster area. A
closer look, however, shows that the
chaos is organised. A few larger
bones stand out—notably the
humerus and a couple of pieces of
jawbone which add up to a metre-
long snout (almost as long as that of
the notorious Tyrannosaurus rex).
A few lumps of rock stand about
with half-revealed ribs or shin-bones
slanting out like modem sculpture.
The rest of 'Claws' consists of
fragments of jagged, dull grey-
brown stone that even a highly
trained geology student would walk
by without a second glance, and
handfuls of sand at the bottom of
cardboard boxes.
Somehow, over the three years
since she was dug out, patient hands
have put the myriad pieces of the
puzzle together into individual ribs,
toes, and other small bones. Even
the tiniest of these are cobwebbed
with the lines of plaster showing that
at least six shards fit together to
form an inch of bone, paper thin as
it is. Among the success stories
stand the boxes for which nothing
can be done, those pieces which are
too badly distorted to be teased
gently back into shape.
Even before the fitting-together
enormous amounts of care, skill and
planning have gone into the project.
Palaeontologists may be strange
creatures, but they're not
completely crazy: they didn't work
in the cold and wet, under the tracks
of the encroaching bulldozers, for
three years, digging out bone by
bone. Fossil hunting has gone high-
tech—expanding polyurethane
foam (which, incidentally, gives off
toxic fumes when made) was used
with plaster to encase the 'semi-
continuous series of irregular stone
blocks'—two vanloads full of
them—found in the vicinity of the
claw. Hardly any bone could be seen
in these except where the bulldozers
had scraped by, but their positions
were mapped before they were
transported back to the lab. Only
there c o u l d the s i d e r i t i c
siltstone—that is, muds cemented
together with iron carbonate—be
broken away to reveal the secrets of
the animal. Pneumatic engraving
tools, diamond-toothed saws, and
thyoglycolic acid; all were used to
remove the tough rock casing.
Just to illustrate the uncertainties
of the job: Alan Charig and Angela
Milner, the senior staff in charge of
the project, found it necessary to say
that the bones were found 'closely
associated...We are confident that
they come from the same animal.'
Joking apart, people have in the
past mistakenly fitted the leaves of
one plant type to the bark and roots
of another. Amazingly, 'Claws' has
remained almost intact through the
millions of years. Almost sixty
percent of the skeleton—well over
hundred bones—has been found; by
the time the model makers are
