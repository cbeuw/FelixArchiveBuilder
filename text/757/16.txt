"Billy Boy" by W. Mason, Methuen
£2.95.
This first novel by author William
Mason chronicles the life and times
of Billy Jenkins, a working class
teacher struggling to make a living
in Jamaica. Billy flees Jamaica after
getting into trouble with the local
gang who put out a death contract
on him. Returning to England he
meets Caroline and falls in love with
her. Caroline has, however, only got
eyes for Callum, her childhood
sweetheart, and ignores Billy totally.
During an intensely erotic
chapter set in Callum's flat,
Caroline realises that Callum's love
is merely a sham and runs to be with
Billy. Billy, thinking that his love is
unrequited, and after a particularly
long and moving account of his
difficult childhood, has meanwhile
hung himself.
The book ends with Caroline
weeping over Billy's body in his flat
in the East End of London.
The prose captures the frailties of
the human condition with startling
precision and is well worth the
struggle through some of the
lengthier chapters, just for Billy's
monologue premature to his
untimely death.

SINCLAIR
H A N D THE M B
SUNRISE'
TECHNOLOGY
Yo ho ho! Christmas is a-coming
and the EEC turkeys, fattened with
oestrogens are getting fat. Those
nice people, the penguin press office,
have sent me four books to review
for your delectation and delight,
and here they are; starring (in
alphabetical order) Ian Adamson
and Richard Kennedy's debagging
of the Sinclair myth "Sinclair and
tne Sunrise Technology", Robert
Bolt's "The Mission", Bengt and
Marie-Therese D a n i e l s o n ' s
"Poisoned Reign" and Margot
Livesey's "Learning By Heart".
The Sinclair book is a bit turgid
for holiday reading, but would come
in handy as a case study for an
economics essay. In this type of
book two flaws are open to the
biographer/journalist; either to
concentrate on personalities at
expense of fact or on fact at the
expense of personality. Unfortun-
ately the latter course was taken,
and when I wanted to know what Sir
Clive is like—does he beat his kids
(or even does he have any), what was
the result of his forceful mother on
his life, does he eat boiled eggs for
breakfast?—I was left with a couple
of pages at the beginning and a few
references to his "forcefulness and
determination". A very masculine
biography, dare I say, with the one
noticeable feature being the way
that all these little-boys-playing-at-
electronics monumentally failed to
answer the question; "what good is
i t ? " . M i n i a t u r i s a t i o n and
innovation were ends in themselves.
Costs £3.95.
"The Mission" book of the film is
several orders of magnitude more
interesting than Sinclair, and a good
read whether you've seen the film or
not. In many places it fills out the
characters and eliminates the
devious politics of the court of
Portugal that cost the Missions their
existance. Some new personalities
are introduced, such as the
ambitious Carvalho, Portugal's
Minister for Foreign Affairs. The
span of the film is better at
transmitting the clash between the
Kingdom of God and the Kingdom
of men, and the'emotional content is
more charged; the book is more
calm and detached: it stands back
and gives a factual account. Costs
£2.95 and definitely worth it.
"Poisoned Reign" by Bengt and
Marie-Therese Danielson is
subtitled, " F r e n c h nuclear
colonialism in the Pacific". It details
the way the French Government has
pettily resisted all moves to
Polynesian independence so that
they can explode a few atom
bombs...Dare one draw parallels
with "The Mission"—one of the
most outspoken proponants of
independence was Pouvanaa, a
Christian pastor who was arrested
on a trumped-up charge of arson at
the age of 64 and sentenced to 8
years solitary confinement plus 15
years banishment from Polynesia. A
very well-written book, it would
make you a confirmed Franco-
phobe, if the authors (who are
goodies) weren't French as well.
Costs £3.95.
The last and best book "Learning
By Heart" is the first collection of
Margot Livesey's short stories. They
are all subtle, with a faintly mystical
air; details are distilled. Many of the
stories are about rocky and
embittered human relationships—
an elder sister who would not let her
younger sister marry until she had, a
man obsessed by death, breaking up
marriages, purely horrible children
and a man who for 'a small price'
seduces a shop-girl in a petty way.
The longest story, 'Learning By
Heart' traces the mirrored lives of a
young woman and her stepmother;
the knock-on effect of unloving—
from her stepmother's unhappy
childhood comes the daughter's
own misery. To quote W.H. Auden,
my pretentious bit for the week;
"Those to whom evil is done/Do
evil in return". But that was about
Hitler. The book nevertheless
manages to steer clear of depression,
and is full of the "warp and woof of
human experience", costs £3.95 and
though it sounds naff to say it,
would make an ideal Christmas
present.
Happy Christmas and a Merry
New Year,
Sarah Kirk.
