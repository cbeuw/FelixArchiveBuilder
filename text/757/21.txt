Sailing
Sailors
Adrift
Ten members of IC Sailing Club
filled two cars on Saturday and set
off for Oxford with some foggy idea
of the whereabouts of Farmoor
reservoir. The first arrived safely,
the other three quarters of an hour
later. Our Captain and Commodore
lost themselves in Abingdon and
asked for directions. Fortunately,
the hapless individual they picked
on was a member of last years team
and knew where the reservoir was!
Back at the pond there was no
wind and the water lay shrouded in
mist. A decision on whether to race
was postponed until the afternoon,
and Oxford sternly got on with some
boat repairs, both teams thinking of
all the far more interesting things
they could be doing.
After lunch it was left to your
intrepid reporter to lead the way. He
sailed off alone into the mist in
search of the windward mark. This
forced the others to get changed and
go in search of him. Miraculously
the mist began to lift and some wind
appeared enabling racing to begin,
your reporter having maneouvered
both teams onto the water.
In the testing light-air conditions
IC lacked boatspeed in the
unfamiliar Laser 2's. Added to this
our Commodore's delight in sailing
into things (like the opposition) and
his quick test of his dry suit neck-
seal (it leaks!) meant that the first
few races all went Oxford's way.
Eventually the team pulled itself
together and began to show what it
was capable of, but by this time it
was too late on in the curtailed series
of races. The result was a narrow
defeat by a team not tactically
superior just slightly faster, the re-
match in the Spring promises to be
even more closely fought. Many
thanks must go to our two drivers
Sam and Adam and to our
Commodore Richard for getting us
there, (via Abingdon?)

Rugby
Rugby Firsts Flatter
The scoreline in this match was
extremely flattering towards
Goldsmiths, who were definitely the
weaker team. Goldsmiths scored
first, after a very lucky kick on in the
IC half, but after that did not really
get a look into the match. The
Goldsmiths pack was comprehen-
sively outplayed in every
department of the game, especially
in the scrummage, where their heavy
pack was destroyed by IC's
organisation and drive. IC's second
run combination of Rob Hogrove
and Louis Christopher drove the
Goldsmiths pack off the park and
were rewarded by a pushover try in
the first half. After half time Andy
Watson, the IC scrum-half, stormed
over for the final try of the match,
after which Goldsmiths tried to
make up for their lack of both brains
and skill by the use of dirty
play—needless to say, it did not
work. IC were now through into the
next round of the Gutteridge Plate
Competition, which will carry on
after Christmas.
Football
Firsts Lose On Penalties
IC's best performance of the season
ended in heartache as Essex moved
into the next round of the UAU on
the lottery of penalty kicks. Essex
were the villains of the piece,
according to the IC camp, after the
reply was forced to be played again
at Colchester. Also, preparations
did not go according to plan—IC
suffered their first defeat this season
at the 13th hurdle to a very strong
London Hospital Side.
Uncharacteristically, IC made a
superb start, completely
overrunning the opposition, and
taking the lead after 10 minutes
when Paul Olden's powerful
downward header bounced into the
top corner. Shortly after, Byron
Wood almost made it 2—0 when his
shot at the far post was miraculously
kicked away by the Essex keeper.
Essex began to find their attacking
movements, and they nearly scored
twice, once hitting the underside of
the crossbar. Essex's equaliser, was
fortuitious, however, as an Essex
player's overhead kick found the
top corner, the half-time score
stayed at 1—1.
In the first meeting, Essex's all
round fitness told in the second half,
but this time round, to their
immense credit, IC dominated
proceedings while not creating
many chances. Essex made even
less. But the pressure of not
conceding anything meant that the
midfields were packed and defences
solid. The full-time score remained
1

Extra time came and went in a
flash and hence to penalties. Essex
scored all of their five kicks, and no
one can argue with that.

From The Sublime
After losing last time out, Selkirk
Hall football team introduced some
new faces on Sunday. With a groin-
strain causing skipper M .
Birmingham to fail a late fitness test,
the scene was set for the return ofthe
elegant skills of R. Tonge. This was
to prove a decisive factor.
Due to security considerations,
the team were told that they were to
play Norman and the Nutburgers,
however this week's opposition
were the experienced Egyptian
Embassy F.C.
Selkirk quickly went 1—Oup with
a tap in by P. Cardwell, but the
diplomats were not to be thwarted.
A well built move resulted in a
crashing shot to equalise.
It was late in the first half that the
ever-threatening Tonge struck.
With a breathtaking run beating
four men, he proceeded to walk the
ball around former Egyptian
national team goalkeeper A.
Lydabylls'it to put the IC team
ahead.
In the second half Tonge
combined well with Cardwell to
present the latter with the first hat-
trick of his international career.
The final result was 4—2 win for
Selkirk.
Football
To The Ridiculous
This was the big one: crashes of
thunder and sheets of lightning
rained down on the blessed turf as
the Gods jostled for a good view of
the game. Commander Galloway
led his faithful into the arena and in
no time play had commenced
Even before the IC war machine
had engaged first gear. The
opposition dealt it a glancing blow
with a headed glance. But their
excessive excitement ended
extremely quickly. Psycho
Galloway, fired up and eyes blazing,
put Jet-Pack Johnson thro-
igh, who
unleashed a ground to air
thundercracker from his own six
yard line.
Even the Gods exclaimed: "Naff
That For a Net Nobbier"
But the Vths take no prisoners
and set to work laying siege on
QMC's isolated penalty area.
Rewards came swiftly—Neville
Neville amazed everyone with a
curling back-heel from the half-way
line. Adrian (the Irish farmer's mad
son) scored a hat-trick in 24
seconds, Charlie slipped in a quickie
to add to the mounting mountain of
goals and then Rapier Radley scored
twice in a mad 4 minutes frenzy.
C o w a r d l y Q M C quietly
capitulated and congratulated our
cast-iron comrades. "Great stuff!"
said the Priest.
