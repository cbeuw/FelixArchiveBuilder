Slinging The Shit
The Geology Department is
carrying out a major review of safety
in an effort to reduce the risks from
hazardous biological and mineral
substances analysed by researchers.
The move follows a scare when two
boxes alleged to contain
Rhinocerous droppings and blood
samples were delivered to the
department three weeks ago. The
samples had not been referred to the
Biological sub-committe on safety,
as is usual when biological samples
are brought into the university,
raising fears that they may present a
safety hazard. Further concern was
raised when a post graduate
working with the samples
contracted Tic Typhus, Protocols
are now being drawn up by the
Geological Safety Department and
future projects will be referred to the
College Head of safety, Dr Gordon
Heardgreaves, for assesment of
biological and toxic hazards.
Guidelines for collecting minerals in
the field will also be draughted in an
attempt to prevent the recuurence of
recent incidents in which students
have collected radioactive and toxic
materials, including blue asbestos,
for polishing and grinding.
Investigations following the
convening of an Emergency Safety
meeting, at the request of trade
union officials, revealed that soil
and vegetation from Nahuru
National Park in Kenya had been
sent to Imperial for trace element
analysis in a project by Dr Ian
Thornton and post graduate John
Maskall designed to make the park
suitable for Rhinocerous habitation.
Samples of Impala blood were
delayed at Imperial, on the way for
analysis at the Mardun Institute of
Education, for three weeks when Mr
Maskall was hospitalised with Tic
Typhus. The soil, which had been
sun-baked prior to shipment before
heat-treatment at Imperial to
remove moisture, was examined by
H e a d of Safety, G o r d o n
Heardgreaves and Ian French ofthe
Biology Department and found to
be non-hazardous. The blood, it was
revealed, has been heat treated to 56
degrees celcius before shipping and
was stored in adaquate containers.
Commenting on the incidents, a
safety official in Geology told
FELIX that he was suprised that the
samples had not been reported to
the Biological Subcommittee and
pointed out that there may have
been a potential danger. He added
"the events have illustrated a
weakness in the College safety
procedure and the whole College
will have to be informed of the
existance of the Biological and
Hazardous Substances Commit-
tees".
Head of Safety in the Geology
Department, Bob Kinghorn, was
interviewed by FELIX last Tuesday
evening. After discussing the issue
for twenty minutes, he then decided
to retract everything he had said,
saying that he did not trust FELIX
to quote him accurately.
Faked Burglaries
Forty one students living in College
halls and houses had their rooms
"burgled" by a special IC Union
security team on Thursday 27th
November. In each case the doors to
the rooms had been left open or
unlocked whilst the rooms were
unattended.
The action was part of a Security
Awareness Campaign carried out by
the ICU Welfare Committee. The
burgling team were briefed to look
for the sort of situations that are
allowing walk-in thieves to remove
considerable amounts of property
from student accommodation. In
each case where a room was vacant
the "burglers" left stickers that
proclaimed that the room had been
burgled and warned residents to
"lock it or lose it".
The action was carried out with
the full approval and cooperation of
the College Chief Security Officer,
Geoffrey Reeves, and the wardens
of the halls and houses concerned.
The team carried badges bearing
Mr. Reeves signature to avoid
confusion with genuine intruders.
Welfare Officer, Tom Melliar-
Smith has warned that residents
should never assume that anyone
wandering around the halls is there
for a legitimate reason and that
anyone who is engaged on College
or Union business should always be
able to prove it if challenged. He
said he though the campaign had
been quite successful in its aim of
Third
Degree
suprising people into being more
aware of the security problem.
The worst residences in terms of
open rooms were Southside and Beit
halls and Southwell house. The only
hitch in the whole operation was
when one of the Southside Assistant
Subwardens tried to stop the team
on his staircase because he was not
in favour of the security campaign.
He finally insisted upon contacting
the warden, Mr. Paul Jowitt,
whereupon Mr. Jowitt instructed
him to stop hindering the team.
Students who started on a four-year
course leading to a BEng in October
1983 (or later) will be awarded a
MEng on graduation if a change to
the University of London
regulations is approved.
The regulations are currently
being considered by the Privy
Council, and a one-year period for
objections to be lodged expires in
four months time, with none so far
received. The same set of changes
will mean that most who started
three year course leading to the
BSC(Eng) after the summer of 1984
will receive a BEng. The only
courses not to be upgraded in this
way are those of Computing and
Metallurgy, which do not at present
include the necessary economics
and humanties courses in the
syllabus.
However, the Academic Council
of the University of London, which
makes decisions on the awarding of
degrees, has not accepted the
principle of backdating the changes.
This leads to the unusual situation
where students who have missed a
year, for example through illness or
failing exams, will graduate at the
same time and from the same course
as others who will receive a more
advanced qualification, putting
them at a possible disadvantage for
life. It is understood that College is
campaigning within the University
of London to have the decision on
backdating changed.
Grant Not
Enough
"Student grants aren't high enough
to live on", according to the
Department of Education and
Science. This admission has come
out of a Government enquiry into
student finances. The Science and
Arts Select Committee are also
investigating funding for students.
The National Union of Students
have recommended that grants be
raised by 21% to bring them up to
the same level, in real terms, as in
1978/79. Other NUS proposals are
to lower the age at which students
are considered 'independent' when
considering awards, and to
introduce an allowance of £35pw for
all students over 16.
Broken Lift
The hydraulic lift used by the CCU
Motor Clubs has been repeatedly
broken, during the past term. The
lift, situated by the Jez garage, near
the Old Chemisty building, is
secured by an electromagnetic lock
to prevent accidents. Keys to the lift
are available from both RCS and
Guilds Motor Clubs but the lock has
been forced at least twice this term,
at a cost of £130 a time.
Ruddy
Enormous
The Natural History Museum has
identified a record-breaking 41b 2oz
rudd, breaking a record which has
stood unchallenged since 1933.
Alwyne Wheeler, the Museum's
Ichythyologist and scientific advisor
to the British Record (Rod Caught)
Committee identified the specimen
by the number and shape of the
pharyngeal teeth, and the relative
positions of the fins.
The specimen rudd will be on
display to the public in the Museum
from the end of December.
The rudd is particularly tasty if
lightly fried in butter, and served
with a white wine sauce.
Open Day
An open day organised by the staff
and students of the RSM last
Thursday attracted over 250
schoolchildren. The cost of the
event was £1300, of which £800 was
donated by industry. Dr Harry
Shaw of the Geology Department,
one of the organisers, said that the
event was great success, and
expressed his thanks to the staff and
students for their help.
