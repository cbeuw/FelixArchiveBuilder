THE GOOD FOOD GUIDE
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
Chemical Engineers
certainly cannot be classed
as 'foodies'.
Not when it comes to
choosing a career, that is.
Yet the food industry does
offer new graduates some
really tempting fare.
Particularly General Foods
where Chemical Engineers
have always found exciting
opportunities to utilise
their skills and develop
rewarding careers - either
in operations or technical
research.
General Foods is one of
Britain's top producers of
high quality convenience
foods and our range of top
brands include famous
names like Maxwell House,
Bird's Custard, Angel
Delight and Cafe Hag.
Our products are all best
sellers and sales continue to
rise.
To maintain our success we
are committed to
substantial investment in
research and product
development at our
sophisticated manufacturing
plant in Banbury.
Which is why we have an
insatiable appetite for
talented Chemical
Engineers brimming with
fresh ideas.
So why starve yourself of
success?
We're visiting your
University on Friday 16th
January 1987. Please
contact your Careers
Service for further details.
