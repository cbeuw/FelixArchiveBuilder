Feature FELIX, Wednesday December 10th 1986 8
One For The Road
FELIX Chief of Staff Pippa Salmon presents a review
of the news which has made most of the headlines since
the beginning of term.
A serious shortage of accom-
modation dominated the news at the
beginning of the term, when it was
disclosed that the Student Services
Office was having difficulty
allocating rooms to all those who
had been guaranteed places. A
Union spokesperson described the
situation as "bloody ridiculous".
Fortunately, most students have
eventually been able to find suitable
places to live, but security in College
residences was put under question
following the rape of a nurse in
Hamlet Gardens. Locking doors
were fitted but the lack of working
entryphones and keys presented
more problems for residents.
There was more trouble for Mr
Peter Hallworth, the Managing
Surveyor of Residences, regarding
the inadequate cooking facilities in
Tizard and Selkirk Halls. The
problems have been going on since
last year, when staircase kitchens
were built in Falmouth Keough Hall
but not in Tizard or Selkirk. Not
only are the present kitchens too
small, but the positioning of fridges
on staircases contravenes fire
regulations. No decision has yet
been made on how or when the
improvements will be made.

Major changes in College life
have been under consideration this
term. The proposed merger with St.
Mary's Medical College has brought
favourable reactions from most of
the Union and College represen-
tatives and discussions are
continuing. Meanwhile, a working
party is investigating the possibility
of setting up another Union
Sabbatical post, to cope with the
increasing workload created by the
expansion of the Union services.
The Union finally took over full
control of the Union Bar in
September and the new Holland
Club was opened last week. A move
less popular with the Union has
been the opening of the QT snack
bar in the JCR. It appears that the
planned JCR-Main Dining Hall
switch will not go ahead, which
means that the Union will effectively
lose its one large function room. A
large section ofthe JCR will be used
as refectory space during the
daytime, if the current plans are
carried out.
More Union anger was caused by
the notorious 'Drinking Clubs'
motion, with officers divided on
whether the three CCU clubs should
be banned from using Union rooms.
The motion was defeated, as was an
anti-Barclays motion, but the issues
raised caused heated debates
throughout College. Motions to
support U L U and Amnesty's Ivan
Starovoit, on the other hand, were
passed with little dissent.
The centenary edition of the
Phoenix was published this term,
amidst some disruption in the
FELIX office caused by the office
move. Copies of what has been
described as "the best produced
Phoenix" are still available from the
bookshop, Union Office and
FELIX office, price 50p.
