Felix FELIX, Wednesday December 10th 1986 10
Christine's
Christmas Bit
Well, amazingly enough it appears
to be "write something festive" time
already. Difficult one, this; having
guarded my image closely for a
whole six months-the cantankerous
idiot who threatens people at UGMs
while secretly furthering her own
raving pinko ambitions (not to
mention making life hard for the
fun-loving CCUs, just for the hell of
it) it seems a shame to lose it all in
one go. (I don't think that was a
sentence-Ed). However I suppose I'll
just have to face the facts and own
up to being a lovable human being
after all.
Of course that's' not the only
problem about writing bits for the
Christms FELIX—anything I write
now will be out of date by the time it
gets to you; because of the
Christmas break there's little chance
of generating response to any
serious comments; and more to the
point, my brain appears to have
gone into hibernation leaving me
devoid of inspiration. So forget the
serious bit and accept a Happy
Christmas instead.
So what do raving lefties do at this
time of year? Don't ask me...I'm
going home for a week, looking
forward to twelve hours sleep a
night, nut roast, and teddy bears
wrapped in recycled paper...Well,
whatever you do this holiday, I hope
it's fun. And a special Happy
Christmas to all the Union office,
Jen, Pat, Kathy, Jackie and
Gutman, and thanks for putting up
with me so far.
Have a good holiday, see you in
January.

Who is
Average?
During the first two weeks of next
term IC Union will be conducting
the largest survey of Imperial
students ever attempted. This article
attempts to explain the reasons for
this project and how it hopes to
achieve useful results.
The Union has in the last few
years acquired control of its own bar
and catering facilities which it plans
to develop. Eventually plans will
have to be drawn up for the future
development of the entire Union. To
do this we need accurate
information about the lifestyle and
social habits of students. For the
union to develop the right facilities it
has to know what students do with
their leisure time, what their eating
habits are and how much they have
to spend.
There is also an increasing
amount of debate about changing
financial circumstances of students.
However there seems to be little
reliable data about the current
position of IC students. Imperial is
not an average university, if such a
thing exists, and so we need to
survey our own population rather
than rely purely on nationally
produced statistics.
Finally there are perennial
questions about what exactly is an
average IC student. Most people
have their own ideas about this
mythical being but there are few
figures to prove these opinions. We
hope to be able to confirm or deny
the traditional view of IC students.
The survey will be conducted by
the Welfare Committee in
association with Student Services by
sending out c o n f i d e n t i a l
questionaires to a representative
cross-section of students. Names of
recipients will be selected by a
r a n d o m process and the
questionaire forms will not carry
any means of identifying those
people. Envelopes for the return of
completed forms will be provided
and secure boxes for posting the
envelopes will be situated at
strategic places in College. In
addition, arrangements will be
made for questionnaires to be
returned via the internal mail service
Associated with the questionnaire
to encourage your enthusiastic
participation will be a raffle for a
variety of goodies. So remember, if
your name is picked out you will be
helping both yourself and your
Union while expending very little
effort indeed.
Forms will be sent out on the first
day of next term to allow you plenty
of time to complete them. The
results will be published in FELIX
once they have been processed and
hopefully they will provide the basis
of discussions for a while to come.
Lastly I must point out that this
questionnaire is purely voluntary
but the importance of the
information it will provide cannot
be underestimated. I must re-
emphasise that replies will be
completely confidential in all
repects and that you can only
benefit by taking part.

Rag Week '86
Rag Week has come and gone and
as Rag Weeks go this has been one
of the most successful.
It started on Wednesday 12th
November with a new (clean?)
version of Morphy Day. And so it
was that the three CCU presidents
set off down Putney High Street
with the aim of chatting up a non-IC
girl and taking her for tea in
Harrods. Small but perfectly
formed Duncan Royle was
resplendent with posh suit,
carnation, champagne and bow tie
whilst all but perfectly-formed
Simon Singh tried to tempt the
ladies with a kit kat and those yellow
shorts. Rob Perry was last seen in a
bar with others of the RSM Exec. In
the end Simon was the first
president past the post after picking
up the amazing Tracey from
Roehampton Institute although he
was narrowly beaten by Guildsman
Simon Childs who reached Harrods
five minutes earlier.
Due to indecision on Man Tai's
part, some drinkers didn't turn up to
The Norfolk—the pub chosen for
"Drink-a-pub-Dry" that night—
but to a completely different
establishment. All the same we
managed to reduce them to half a
barrel of lager before the landlord
realised what was happening and
stopped serving us, at 10.30 pm.
The hypnosis lecture brought the
largest attendance since it started
seven years ago. One hundred and
fifty of the audience volunteered to
be hypnotised and of these, eight
were kept back for further
embarrasment. They were made to
do silly things like see a
hippopotamus walking across the
stage, when with perfect timing,
Man Tai walked through a side door
(hippo-potato-mus?).
Friday was the G u i l d ' s
carnival—a brilliant event, that
would have been even better had
more of you turned up.
I can't remember much of
Saturday but I am told I enjoyed
Southside's cocktails...
Yes, I did get up for the Raft Race
the next morning, and it was won
most convincingly by Guilds.
Sunday evening was Chaps Curry
and Barnite which was very poorly
attended—perhaps everyone was
still recovering from the Raft Race?
(or cocktails?)
A lot of dirty people
turned out
for the RSM Dirty Disco on
Monday, but the highlight of the
night was definitely Julian's streak
round the Queen's Tower.
Wednesday's Beer Festival, as
usual, was the most successful Rag
event; in fact, some people enjoyed
it so much that they didn't want to
leave. In the end we carried them out
and cleaned up—thanks folks, the
JCR never looked cleaner than it did
the next morning.
The Smoking Concert on
Thursday was a chance for various
people who should have known
better to show what talent (or lack
of it) they possessed. The most
notable of these were Fiona's poem
(which won the "Best Act"), the
Chaps Sketch, the Guilds Exec, and
the the inevitable Guilds Rugby.
Chas Brereton also resurfaced
having completed his 48 hour piano
marathon a week before, and played
at the Carnival and the Beer
Festival. (Is there no limit to this
man's enthusiasm?)
Friday, and the R S M actually
won an event:-true, it was the Boat
Race, but it's better than nothing. In
the evening we had Rag and Drag-
the most colourful party of the
week. Imagination had run riot, and
some men had really gone to town
on their dresses. Someone who shall
remain nameless (called Nigel) liked
his dress so much he wore it to
lectures on Monday.
SCAB night was a very cultured
way to end Rag week, and showed
how much talent there really is in IC
The magnificent Trombone Trio
received the most thunderous
applause, and a close second was
Debsoc's debate—"This house
proposes that Wombles are the
zenith of creation." Both sides
spoke convincingly but the motion
was almost unanimously carried.
Rag Week officially finished with
SCAB Night but the dedicated
"1,000,001 darts" players kept
going until Monday to score
1,000,001.
So there it was—Rag Week 1986.
I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I
did, and many, many thanks to
everyone who helped in every way.
A special thanks though to the Rag
publicity team, the Rag Committee
and the organisers of the Beer
Festival and Carnival. See y o U j
next year!
