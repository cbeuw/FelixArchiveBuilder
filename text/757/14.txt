Bored with gutting buffalo and
spearing innocent travellers on the
plains? We present a game of modern
living for every s a v a g e n o u v e a u .
You axe Boris the Barbarian, fearless fighter and blatant card
cheat, in search of fulfillment and mindless violence. However,
you found yourself engaged in an argument with a mighty wizard
about whether a pair is worth more than a flush, in which you still
maintain that cutting off his left arm was an accident. But if
people will insist on muttering to you in arcane languages and
making rude gestures this sort of thing is going to happen. The
wizard amazed, at the amount of information you can pack into
the single word "urgh", decides to transport you into another
world — totally different from your own. A world where wizards
don't exist and Barbarian means a rugby player from New
Zealand. Boris has become part of the 20th century.
Playing the game
This part is dead simple, unlike our more expensive counterpart.
Boris has the nasty habit of winning fights , mainly because the
average 20th Century citizen doesn't own a broadsword. This
means that combat rules are dead simple, as there aren't any.
All you have to do is calculate Boris' intelligence by rolling
three dice and adding up the total. Not very clever is he?
Occasionally you will be called upon to make a saving roll.
This involves rolling two dice, adding Boris' Intelligence score to
it and seeing if the total is more than 20. If it is then you have
made the roll, if it isn't then you have failed.
All that remains is to say that you start at paragraph 1 and
carry on according to which decisions you make or are told to go.
In terms of equipment, Boris may be considered to have a
broadsword, full plate armour, a backpack, a small knife for
taking stones out of hobbits' feet, and a pair of Doctor Marten's
Air Wair Seven League Boots. He also has a bag of two hundred
golden Grogs, taken from the pocket of a certain wizard prior to
transportation. Now go to paragraph 1.
1 Dazed and somewhat confused
you wake up in a vast hall containing
giant hexagonal structures and
glowing glass plates. People are
milling around in lightweight cotton
clothing. You can just about make
out two words in the distance — FT
Index. Being a barbarian you tell
yourself that Fourier Transforms are
wizard's business and not to be
tampered with.
Suddenly, as your ears clear from
the shock of being sent spiralling
through the dimensions by a powerful
spell — something, which along with
smoking the Gilda weed, the Council
of Alchemists has put an official
health warning on — you realise that
someone is trying to talk to you.
His language is difficult to
understand, but you can just about
work out that he is asking if you are a
Barbanogram and who is it that you
are looking for.
You tell him that you are Boris the
Barbarian, and have been sent here by
a mighty wizard who was pissed off at
losing at Poker. The man says he
understands and starts to explaining
about the place he calls the 'Stock
Exchange'. It is only when he gets to
the bit about Milton Friedman and
Monetarism that you realise you are
falling into a deep sleep.
Make a saving roll on Intelligence.
If you make it go to 30. If you fail go
to 15.
2 Don't you find this mindless
violence boring after a while? Very
well, you kill her. Now, do you kill the
man (31) or run away (20)?
3 You go over to the window,
where you tell the receptionist all your
details. She tells you that there isn't
much demand for barbarians these
days, especially without any 'O'-
levels.
She gives you a piece of card with
the name of a regf up on it, and
tells you tc . on every other
Monday. Puzzled as to why a reggae
group should appear there, you
wander down to the Jobcentre. Go to
22.
4 At that point the Managing
Director comes in and tells you that
he likes your style. He says he hasjust
had a visit from the Alliance leader,
who says that Roy Jenkins just isn't
the man he was, and would you like to
stand at the next election for the
Alliance. Go to 23.
5 While walking (kSwnVaj
you see a 'room to let' signet do
seem too bad/{jjon^fh^
perhaps a little respectable
image-conscious barbarian, -
you ring the doorbettr^
An elderly woman app
door, cigarette irj her moutfC?3
Although slightly perturbed at youl
mode of dress, she decides that you^
seem wholesome enough and leads
you in. On the way in you ask her
where she gets the disposable Gilda
Weed pipes from, and how long does
the fix last.
All she says is: "Bloody kids, all
they ever think about." and carries on
up the stairs.
Eventually you come to the room,
and you have a look inside.
Remembering your home world, you
tell her about the Caves of Bogg
where you get hot dripping water
through the roof as an optional extra.
She demands a month's rent in
advance. Do you pay her (13) or get a
job instead (20)?
6 Roll a die. If it comes up
1—3, go to 17, if it comes up 4—6, go
to 12.
7 Not doing very well today,
are we Boris? As a result of your
inability to get the dice to do the right
thing, you are now in a room of
glowing glass screens. Next time try
nudging the table, or use loaded dice
or something. Anyway, Geoffrey has
brought you to this roo:
jobber.
As far as you can makf'out, this
involves bashing lots of kw so that
numbers appear on the screen, and
head-butting the screen if this doesn't
work. You think that you can really
get to grips withjMe head-butting
part, even if the ^jr-bashing part
doesn't turn you on.
Go to 29.
not half as respectful as he should be
to a barabarian, you break his neck.
Chaos suddenly breaks out in the
room, as people demand that you
stop pushing in as they havce been
waiting for the last two days to get an
interview, and could be bothered to
bring their sleeping bags.
Do you decide on a quiet life and
queue instead (14) or slay therestof
these upstarts (25)?
12 You find a job going at the
local creche, and dutifully trot down
there for an interview. The
interviewer doesn't seem to be too
keen on your style of dress, and that
your sword is somewhat aggressive,
and she didn't know what the ILEA
would have to say about it.
Roll a die, if it comes up 1—3, go to
26, if it comes up 4—6, go to 33.
13 You give her a Grog — a
large piece of nearly solid gold with a
small admixture of lead depending on
the honesty of the local mint — and
settle into your room.
Feeling tired after the day's
exertions, you go to sleep. Several
hours later you are awakened by the
sound of moaning and a hideous
slapping, cracking sound. Thinking
that someone is being killed next
door, vrm ysLllfli enlist your sword

woman standing over him, holding a
whip aloft.
"Aha, a houri!" you cry.
"Old fashioned aren't you, love?"
she replies.

19 It gets to Monday, and you
go to sign on. After a few weeks they
get rather pissed off at you killing all
the people before you in the queue,
and agree to send a cheque through
the post every two weeks if you stay
away and go down the Jobcentre
instead. Go to 22.
20 You find yourself in a
dingy room full of people either
sitting at windows, or waiting to sit at
the windows. A sign on the wall says
'Unemployment Benefit Office'. You
come to the conclusion that the name
of this game is to sit at a window and
try to communicate with the person
on the other side.
Do you wait your turn (14) or pull
someone out of the way to get in
quick (11)?
21 The interviewer asks if you
have any qualifications, to which you
reply that you won the Conan Award
for skinning rabbits.
He tells you that you are not quite
the sort of person hisfirmare looking
for, but he wishes you the best of luck
in your search for a job.
Do you look for anotherjob (22) or
kill the interviewer (16).
22 You arrive at the Jobcentre
and look on the board set aside for
barbarians. Make a saving roll on
your luck, if you fail go to 19, if you
succeed go to 6.

He asks you how you feel about
this, and while you would honestly
like to tell him all about the angst of
being an everyday teenage frog, it
only seems to come out as "Rivit."
The game is over. If you want to
play again, simply go to paragraph
one again.
24 With a mighty blow from
your sword, you cleave thefigureof
the Stockbroker in two. Disturbed at
his lack of resistance you wonder if
you have done therightthing, but this
is the sort of action barbarians are
famous for and you tell yourself how
proud your father would berightnow
at killing yourfirstStockbroker.
You notice that a lot of people all
seem to be looking at you now, with a
few screaming and shouting quite a
lot. Do you run away (18) or wait
around (28)?
25 Now let's face it, chaos is
your favourite atmosphere, and you
hack into the assembled crowds until
there is just you and a lot of dead
bodies in the room. Go to 3.
26 You casually mention that
you are a hereditary peer, and that
your father is a big noise in the meat
business. She turns an odd purple
colour, calms down, and tells you that
you are not quite the sort of person
they are looking for. Go to 22.

' fatter ofthe men asks you if

called Pig.
"Yes, Sir Pig," you reply proudly,
trying not to notice the annoyance on
his face.
"Got a right fruitcake 'ere,"
mutters his accomplice. You gather
from this that barbarians are known
as fruitcakes in this neck of the
woods.
The one you think is called Fuzz
asks you if you would like to
accompany them to the station. You
reply that you haven't been
introduced properly yet, and that
your mother warned you about men
like them, leading young warriors
astray.
They produce short black clubs.
Do you surrender (32) orfight(10)?
29 It is after you've head-
butted your 20th terminal that you
are summoned to see the Big Jobber.
He is rather disturbed at your habit of
destroying the computers whenever
there is a 2 point drop in the FT
Index, and that he must ask you to
leave. But he does point out that the
Prime Minister came round recently
and said that she was in need of a
replacement for Norman Tebbitt as
his "batteries were beginning to go
flat."
Do you go to the Dole Office 20,
find somewhere to live 5 or become a
Conservative MP 23?
30 You realise you are being
hypnotised by a Level thirteen
Stockbroker. Do you run away (18)
orfight(24)?
31 You weren't too keen on
the way that the man enjoyed being
killed — but these things happen.
Now, do you run away (20) or hang
around for the hell of it (27)?
32 Wimp! You are taken to a
place known as a Police Station,
where lots of people called Bobby,
Fuzz and Pig hang out, so to speak.
You are introduced to the Station

trickjyou learned in the Nicotine

involves holding one of your
assailants off with your left foot,
while you rip the arms off the other
one. However, Fuzz (the one who
hasn't just undergone major surgery)
doesn't seem to be too impressed with
your trick and starts blowing on a
whistle.
You decide that the best policy is to
run away, following the advice of the
great prophet, Glenoddle: 'He who
runs away doesn't get trodden on by a
dirty great giant'.
Do you go East 20 or West 5?

sells you to mind your step.
He begins to fill out a form, and

qualifications like 'O'-levels. You
reply that you don't, but you say that
you love small children, and that you
know several good recipes. She is
delighted and offers you a job
immediately.
After making several barbecues
with a few of the more well-off
children, a person who claims to be a
militant introduces himself to you.
You say that he would never make a
soldier, but he doesn't seem to
understand this, and carries on to say
that Dennis Skinner isn't quite as
vociferous as he used to be, and how
would you like to be known as Boris
the Beast of Bolsover. You think this
is areallyneat idea, and go instantly
to 23.
