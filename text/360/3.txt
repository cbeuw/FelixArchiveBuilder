Agricultural Society Trophy, the Jack

NUS Conference
Motions and debate
Most of the morning session was spent
ini procedural wangling amongst the
fragmented left. The only significant
result of this was that the order paper
was changed so that the G-ants Motion
was in the morning and the Free Speech
was in the afternoon.
The Grants Motion was the subject of
numerous arnmendmsnts, the exact
texts of which are too long to include
here. The net result of the debate was
that the NUS President was censured
for his conduct in issuing statements
prejudicial to ths interests of the NJS
grants campaign, and that ths present
NUS policy is now very close to that of
this Union (UGM June 13, 1974). The
g-ants campaign fo* next term is to be
considered during ths summer by the
National Executive.
The Free Speech debate was held in the
afternoon session (after a 15 minute
lunch break). In the opinion of the
delegation the substantive and ammend-
ments 2 and 3 were in line with IOJ
Policy (UGM June 13 1974). W
e accord-
ingly voted against amendment 1, which
would have permitted violence and
disreuption to bs used in opposition to
fascists and racists. W
e voted for
amnendment 2, wh'ch was passed b/ a
large majority. Ammendments 3 and 4
fell at this point because they would
have produced the same question as
aminendment 2 which had already been
passed. Ammendntint 5 (Much sought
to leave NUS without a policy on racism
was withdrawn and the ammended
substantive was passed.
The new NUS policy is to allow CO's
to decide at UGM's whsther or not to
allow a racist or fascist speaker a plat-
form, and to oppose racism and fascism
by non-violent methods.
Conduct at th; Conference
1/ Th3 delegation asks council to note
that Independent Television News
filmed only those speeches which ware
in favour of violent anti-racist tactics ,
except fo* a brief shot of the delegate
who asked that they bs excluded bscause
of ths.
2/ M' East was not present between
1.3Dpm and the close of conference
(6 15pm). As a result ths students of
this college were not fully represenyed
at the conference fa- this period.
3/ All delegates voted in accord with
Union policy where this existed (this
excludss Mr East who, if he was in the
hall at all may have voted in an/ manner)
4/ Whilst any delegate (except Mr
East) was out the hall his/her voting
card was passed to Mr Lane in order
that the Union might still excerciseits
full voting r
ignts.

Dslegation Leader
All IC students not living in IC halls or
houses or Union Flats should have
received a copy of the accomodation
questionnaire, via their letter racks,
by now. This is to provide a list of
addresses that IC students can go to at
the beginning of next term (if you're still
here then) in the hope that they may find
accomodation for the next academic
tear. It will also help in giving an
indication of the types of accomodation
that IC students live in, the sort that
they would like to live in, how long they
have to spend travelling eye.
Please ignore the instruction on the
front asking you to return the question-
naire to the Union office by the 1st May,
but it would be appreciated if you could
return it before the end of term ie this
weel if possible. As much relevent
information as you can supply would
be a great help as this will enable me
to give students more information about
where they ought to try.
I shall be resident in Beit Hall (examiners
permitting) for the three weeks before
the beginning of term to sort out the
questionnaires and give out the addresses
to people who wish to take advantage
of this service. I shall probably be
operating from the Union Office which
should by then be where the present
television room is. The service, however
will be much better if I get all the
questionnaires back, not just 10% or
20%, so even if the answers to yours
and your flat-mates are nearly the same
return them nevertheless to Paul
Wadsworth or any of the Union Officers
c/o the Union Office.
