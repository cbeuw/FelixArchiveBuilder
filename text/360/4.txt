DEPUTY
As not many of you could come to your
AGM I thought I had better report in
FELIX.
M R S
Mike is the Imperial College Union's
mascot. It is a three foot long working
screw gauge micreometer which I brought
back to college this year. Ad the mascot
club Wooden Horse Organisation is
somewhat defunct it was neccessary to
elect from the AGM a new coordinator.
FURNITURE
The situation as regards furniture in the
Union areas when I took office was
atrocious and worse still was that nothing
was on order. Having fought for the
neccessary money at Council before
Christmas I placed the order. The tables
for the lower refectory have arrived and
the chairs are due next week. The furn-
iture for the lower lounge should arrive
next month as should the concert hall
chairs.
TV
The best colour TV in the world is now
in the Union building and a bloody good
monochrome in Southside.
SOUTHSIDE
All the furniture in Southside has been or
is being renovated with a firm which
Mr Daniels (who received social colours)
and I found off our own backs.
Southside bar has been completely
renovated because I pushed the plans
through a committee which had been
talking about it for years. People like
Mr Seaford (who received social colours)
were keen to help but their hands are
tied unti I someone does the donkey work
on drafting and presenting concrete
proposals, not ideas. W

My final PAWNO simply takes the form
of the Annual Report that I gave at the
Annual General Meeting last week.
"Presenting Annual Reports at the AGM
is more difficult than at Council because
it has to be read aloud whereas Council
members can be expected to read a
longer one.
"Elections, on the whole have run •
smoothly. There are disappointments,
however, in that there are still unfilled
posts on Accomodation Committee,
and on Welfare Committee. Hopefully
people w'll stand naxt term.
My main concern since Xmas has been
relix. I have tried m
y best and I hope
you wore satisfied with it. The new
printing unit that has been arranged
should, with the help of the new editor,
ensure that once again Felix really does
become the "Newspaper of Imperial
College"
PRESIDENTS
finished stage 1 and stage 2 has been
sent to contract. This will provide new
adequate recreation facilities such as
darts and bar-billiards in Southside.
IISdPUNE
I have tried to be as ibformal as possible
and this attitude is proved right in
asmuch as the amount of outright
violence has been very small, only half
a dozen occaisions in the year. Duty
Officers have been a flop for many
reasons but now a new proceedure is to
to be put to Council by me. This will
an enforceable one and I know that m
y
successor will be able to use this
procedure to cut down the amount of his
time that is wasted.
EXTERNAL
I attended two NUS conferences and three
LSO meetings.
GENERAL

maintenence side. Every bopper in
London phones me at weekends and

GENERAL
Day to day, I run the Union on the

in London phones me at weekends and
evenings only to ask me about ENTS
concerts.
RESIGNATION
I feel that I've done a fair sized job
which was quite beyond me. As an under-
graduate (Physics 2) it was very hard
to fit in the dozens of meetings and time-
consuming business such as chasing
Mr Mooney and Mr Seaford simultan-
eously.
In my Council report I made some
conments that are relevent here.
Firstly, I am still of the opinion that
thare are too many hangers-on on
Council, there purely for their own
interests (normally political) and with
no interest in representing the actual
views of the mass of students that they
are supposed to represent. Also, too
many people, both on Council and in the
Union as a whole are willing to crit-
icise and complain, but will offer
neither constructive comroants or any
actual physical help.
I should point out that thase commants
apply just as much to the piss-artists
wv
»o spend most of thair time disrupt-
ing meetings by their useless comments
stubborness and downright rudeness as
it does to so-called "lefties".
I was therefore shocked to hear that
the President did not consider my
efforts sufficient to merit the Union
General Award which is the traditional
mark of thanks from the Union. To add
insult to injury, rather than tell me
straight out the President sent me a
letter.
I had intended to get a job in London
for the summer so that I could continue
as Deputy President until July 31 as I
should and so that I could build a plinth
for MIKE and order next year's furn-
iture with my successor.
Tffis was quite a sacrifice to make as I
have had only three weeks out of col lege
since the end of August when I came up.
After receiving what I consider a kiqk
in the face from the President I am
feeling a bit pissed off and therefore
asked the Annual General Meeting to
accept my resignation at Joint Council J
on Monday 13 June. The purpose of
hanging on till then is to give Ron Kill
who has most kindly agreed, with the
AGM's approval, to take office from
then, some chance. As it is even though
he will have my Council reports to help
he will be being thrown in at the deep
end and I would ask that you bear with
him if he takes a little time to work
into the job.
Finally I should like to thank all the
people, both students and college staff,
who have helped me throughout the year
and I would like them to know that it has
been much appreciated.
David Sinclair
This year has shown just what can be
done with reasoned discussion and
negotiation. W
e live in a world where
the ability to "meet in the middle" is a
neccessity to good relations batwaen
the Union and College.
I leave the Union soon with few reg-ets.
I have enjoyed my time here, had a good
tima, made a lot of friends. Howaver,
I'm glad that it'll soon be over. The
Union has still not got over its problems
of lacke of active participation and is, I
feel, unlikely to do so in the immediate
future.
It is in your hands to change this.
Your esteamad executive-elect
can't do it, however high their
aspirations may be. Only you,
the Union's members, can inc-
rease the participation'.'
