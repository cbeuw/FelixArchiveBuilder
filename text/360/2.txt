Dear P resident.
Executive members and members of the
Students' Union.
I would like this read out to you at your
meeting, in case I am unable to attend.
I am very proud of the high honour you
have conferred on me. You have made
the messenger department and me very
proud indeed. The messengers are always
willing to help and co-operate with
Students at all times.
It may be debatable as to whether I
Realty earned this high honour. Perhaps
you are leaned a little towards me as I
retiring to pension and a life of ease
(wife permitting), on the 21st June,
Nearly five years I have worked in the
Beit Complex. Receiving and despatch-
ing trunk cases. Showing mums and dads
where to go when visiting. Opening doors
when locked out of rooms. Re-directing
maile and a host of small things, done
willingly to help your stay at the
College perhaps a little more pleasent.
I admire yoyr campaigns for Charity.
Particularly the Cancer Research of
which I am particularly interested as I
was once, like John Wayne the actor.
I beat the "Big C".
During m
y 28 years service in the army
I was the recipient of 2 honours, but I
class your Social Honour grandest of all.
When visiting the College, which I shall
do, I will proudly wear your tie.
Bless you all
Yours faithfully
G.Stroker
Dear Sir.
I read with great interest your letter
to Mr Wilson concerning fish and chip
shops which appeared in Felix no.359.
The nearest chippie known to me is at
the top of Elystan Street SW3(see
accompanying map) which is only four
minutes walk from South Kensington
Station. The chippie itself is actually
in Elystan Street and is not to be con-
fused with the attached fish restaurant
whose entrance is in the Fulham Road.
Prices have risen somewhat in the last
twenty years since I first patronised the
establishment, and I suspect the quality
of the product has not been maintained
under its new management - things have
never been the same since they stopped
using newspapers - but the shop is open
late on most nights of the week except
for Sundays.
Yours sincerely
R.Halle

I make no excuses for printing the folow-
ing article in full from the Sun newspaper.
Student teacher Keri Hughes "drowned"
in drink after a college initiation
ceremony. i.-
He drank a bottle of vodka to celebrate
his 21st birthday with 17 members of a
group. And he choked to death as he
slept off the effects.
An inquest at Barry, Glamorgan, was
told yesterday that Keri was presented
with a silver tankard by the group and
was expected, by tradition, to drink a
bottle of spirits.
Before drinking the vodka he had eight
pints of beer at several pubs. Coroner,
Mr Williams Adams said:"This was a
sadistic, stupid, and uncivilised practice,
It is extraordinary how easily and
foolishly a life can be lost.
The coroner was told the tankard club
at Glamorgan College of Education had
been banned by the authorities after
Keri's death.
A report showed Keri's blood alcohol
count was three or four times above the
breathalyser level.
