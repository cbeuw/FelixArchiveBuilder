Wing
Chun
The Imperial College W i n g Chun K u n g Fu
Club has had an excellent A u t u m n term
with standards of achievement and
training maintained at a high level by the
expert knowledge of Master Sid Sofos.
Events included gradings, charity events
(raising over £1,000 for deaf children) and
our annual Christmas dinner.
A demonstration of the principles of
Wing Chun will be held on Wednesday 23
January at 1.30pm in the Union G y m . A
new beginners class will start on
Wednesday 30 January. By training in
Wing Chun y o u develop a means of self-
defence w h i c h increases self-confidence
increasing self-respect, but K u n g Fu is
much more than fighting.
It is a way of disciplining the mind to
achieve higher mental concentration and
a fascinating insight into your o w n
personal emotions and behaviour.
So m u c h for the martial, W i n g Chun is
also an art hence the term martial art.
The art is revealed in the beauty of the
physical movements and the philosophies
opening up a world many overlook.
Come along to the demonstration you
have nothing to lose and everything to
gain.
Conservative
After last week's article in F E L I X on the
Labour Club, it is only fair that the
ConSoc has its say.
The ConSoc is still by far the largest,
most active and most enjoyable political
society in College. Just in the last term
we have two very successful speaker
meetings with Cecil Parkinson and
Edwina Currie, a couple of parties—one
of which was at the House of Commons.
Some of our members were able to meet
the new Prime Minister, M r John Major
and congratulate him personally.
This term, w e have even more events
to come of both political natures. For
example, members may come to our
prestigious A n n u a l Dinner, with special
guest Enoch Powell.
Despite what you may believe, our
members' views reflect the entire
spectrum of opinion within the
Conservative Party.
To find out more about our activities,
do come to our lunchtime meetings every
Friday at 12.30pm in Physics 737.
Scout &
Guide
For all you gruesome turtle dudes who
missed out, here's a taster of what
happened last term. For starters we had
spaghetti bolognese up in the Peak
District. The weather was good, as
always, except for the cloud and rain
which lasted all weekend. A good laugh
was had as we convinced freshers that
throwing yourself off rock faces in the
freezing cold is T H E thing to do. During
dinner Phil 'I know how to prussok'
Wickens found himself stuck, and had to
eat suspended (rather painfully) from the
ceiling. A search for sanity led us to the
local pub and then the silly games
began...
The next weekend we .all piled into the
back of a minibus with our gear and
headed up to the Midlands. Okay, so
there are no mountains in the Midlands,
but there are canals. Equipped with two
barges we managed to wreak havoc on
the British waterways through non-stop
waterfights, bridgehopping and extremely
bad driving.
After a couple of weeks drying out we
packed our bags once more and headed
off to South Wales this time. Destination
the Black Mountains staying in a village
hall for the weekend. Most people went
off walking in extremely strong winds,
although the hard-core rock climbers
managed to make it to the local cafe. The
highlight of the weekend was a visit to
Abergavenny's trendiest pub packed with
Sharons, Tracys, and Kev the Lads.
Thanks go to Nick and J i m for nearly
getting us kicked out.
By the end of term most people were
worn out, and so only fourteen of us set
off to Yorkshire. This turned out to be
the laziest and most luxurious weekend
ever. The hut had thirty beds, showers,
baths, a TV, a pool table and a
microwave oven. After crawling out of
bed at 11 o'clock a couple of us lept on
to our bikes and cycled over the
Whernside plateau and up Ingleborough
Hill. Reaching the top at 4 o'clock we
rode back d o w n in the pitch black,
thankfully without falling off. Whilst some
managed to go out walking, others
preferred to stay in watching Wac-a-Day
and visiting the pub opposite.
Over the Christmas holiday the winter
tour went up to Fort William in Scotland
for a week, but that's a long story. If this
sounds like your Pot Noodle look on the
noticeboard under Beit A r c h for further
details. Dib, Dib, Dib. Be prepared.
Canoeing
The trip to the Upper Dart at the end of
last term was eventful to say the least.
A r r i v i n g at the campsite on Dartmoor at
two in the morning and pitching tents in
inches of snow ended of course in a
snowball fight. The journey down to the
river on Saturday was a bit hair raising,
with one in five slopes covered in snow.
'Where's the road?', was a good question,
but Eric the driver could handle anything.
O n to the canoeing and the five mile
stretch of river we tackled was supposed
to be a challenge for this year's
beginners, the larger rapids, aptly named
the Washing Machine and the like, I'm
afraid I can't comment on except to say I
was fished, spluttering out of most of
them.
The next morning, we decided against
frozen wetsuits and took the smal canoes
sledging, racing six year-olds down hills,
canoes against plastic trays. That was the
perfect end to a fun weekend, one of the
best so far.
Snooker
The more observant a m o n g you will have
noticed that the long awaited token
meters are in operation. This effectively
means that only members can use the
club facilities.
To get your tokens come to the Club
with your membership card any
lunchtime.
The quota is three tokens per member,
per week, four if you pay an extra £1.00
(one-off).
