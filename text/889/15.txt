College Day
Following Monday night's Council:
An Extraordinary General Meeting of the
Union will be called to discuss (hopefully
for the last time) any proposed changes
to the College day. This will be the only
item of business. I hope to invite several
members of College staff to participate in
the debate. The meeting will be held on
Tuesday 22 January, 1.00pm in the JCR.
At its next scheduled meeting on
Monday 28 January, 1 anticipate the
working party will make its final report—
this is thus potentially your last chance to
voice your opinion on the matter.
Also, I recommend that all'students
who either agree or disagree with
working 9-6, write an appropriate letter
to their head of department, copying it to
the Rector, Sir Eric A s h and myself. This
gives me more information to bring to
the working party.
