Well, just to b e totally radical I'm going
to take the immortal advice of Basil
Fawlty and not mention the war. I'm
going to talk about something m u c h
closer to our hearts. No, not the nerve
gas in the Iraqi Embassy, but:
Things that suck, no. 1: Extending
the College Day
Right, let's get a few things straight
(don't even think it). T h e whole thing (I
was going to say idea, but that gives it
much more credit than it deserves)
started with t w o goals i n m i n d . By, the
way, when I say 'started' I mean that it
has now. Whether or not the Rector had
gone as far as to think up a justification
for screwing us all before setting up the
'Working' Party is not certain. A n y w a y ,
the excuses they're giving n o w are:
(i) T o ease the pressures on such places
as the QT, refectories, a n d the Union
Snack Bar that are caused by a uniform
lunch hour.
(ii) To provide more lecture a n d lab
space by giving more hours in the
time-table.
In order to ease these problems they
proposed to have different lunch hours
for different groups within the College,
and to start earlier and/or finish later. In
case y o u haven't realised, the first would
screw clubs that meet at lunch time, the
second, well, think of a problem (hint:
There's loads: Cleaners unable to finish
work before college starts, w o m e n
travelling home later, staff having trouble
getting to and from home, not to mention
the stress of longer hours at work for
students and staff, etc.etc.)
So, what have they done? Well,
typically enough for a committee, very
little. A s yet none of the staff, cleaners,
security or students have been formally
consulted, a n d neither have any of the
unions concerned. ICU itself is a little
better off, mainly because even His
Rectorness couldn't stop Paul Shanley
(ICU President) from sitting on the
W o r k i n g Party.
Consequently some of the CCUs have
organised surveys, and I C U (under the
steady hand of E l Presidente) has
organised both U G M s a n d a referendum,
in order to present the opinion of the
students to the W o r k i n g (?) Party. Guess
what? In all of them there was a
resounding 'fuck off (about 9 0 % against).
A n d guess what else? They've ignored
them. Totally. Apparently the C C U survey
was carried out i n a manner that was
'weighted against the proposals', and as
there were only just over 500 papers
completed in the referendum it was
'unrepresentative of the general feeling of
the students'. B y the way, a U G M only
needs 300 to be quorate, and therefore
pass a motion w h i c h could have a huge
affect o n college. A s to the U G M result:
who knows?
They are n o w proposing a College day
of 9-6, with a one hour lunch from 1-2.
That's really going to help point (i), isn't
it? A s to point (ii), staff that I've spoken
too think that the problem is more one of
organisation and co-operation between
departments. To this end College, in a
totally uncharacteristic fit of clear-headed
sensibleness, have decided to have a
space audit (kind of like a financial audit,
but with rulers instead of the Fraud
Squad). W e live in hope as to its results.
Our last chance to do something comes
next Tuesday (the 22nd) lunchtime, at 1
p m , in the JCR when the U n i o n is holding
an Extraordinary (read E M E R G E N C Y )
General Meeting, or E G M for those of y o u
that like initials. For God's sake, for O U R
sake, for anybody that y o u care about's
sake, B E T H E R E ! It's only an hour of
your time, a n d without it, we're at the
mercy of whatever the fuck they want to
do. Pretty please.
Things that suck, no. 2: War
Okay, so I lied; I a m going to mention
it. A quick review of the situation up until
midnight our time on Wednesday the 9th.
(Bear with m e for a sec, there is a point.
Honest).
Saddam Hussein claws a n d back-stabs
his w a y to power. Time passes. H e goes
to w a r with Iran, with Western (not just
American) backing. T h e w a r lasts eight
years. In this time his economy takes a
dive (surprise), so he borrows lots of
dosh, mainly from other A r a b states,
including the very rich Kuwait (remember
that - it's important). The w a r ends
inconclusively. Saddam has b i g debts, a n d
an economy that makes A m e r i c a look
healthy. H e also has an overwhelming
A
S
F
Bit
ambition (publicly stated m a n y times) to
see a combined A r a b nation (guess w h o
he'd like to see in charge. Remember this
- it's important). Kuwait starts to call in its
loans. Spurred o n by this example
(remember the word 'example' - it's
important) several other A r a b nations do
the same. Saddam can't p a y (surprise).
His o w n solution to this problem is, as
they say, history. B y invading Kuwait he
kills three birds with one stone (clever
move. O r so he thought): H e makes an
example (told y o u it was important) of
Kuwait, thus discouraging the other Arabs
from trying to get their money. H e also
planned to loot the rather overladen
coffers of Kuwait, easing his economy
(not to mention the oil). Lastly he takes
step numero uno towards domination of
the Middle East. What a clever chap (I'm
actually being sincere).
Unfortunately for him... Well, y o u know
the rough story. I don't think anyone
would deny that Saddam Hussein (notice
that I refer to h i m , not Iraq. H e is to
blame for the actions of his country) had
no right to invade Kuwait (arguments that
revolve around events that occurred
nearly a century ago are idiotic). There is
no moral justification for w h y he has
done it, a n d whathe's been doing since.
He cannot be allowed to stay. Kuwait,
even all the other A r a b nations couldn't
and can't stop him.
But, as I've said, war sucks. However,
for negotiations to be effective there have
to be two willing participants. M e n like
Hussein cannot be allowed to do as they
wish. They must be stopped, just as Hitler
had to be stopped. Thus w e come to the
crux of the problem: W a r sucks, but
negotiation won't work. T h e U N have
decided o n their course. Before w e
condone or condemn, w e must think
what w e would do, a n d be honest in our
appraisal of h o w realistic our suggestions
are.
