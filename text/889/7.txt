Frankenstein Unbound
Here Felix presents a new technique in
film reviews: The in-fiim dialogue!
Alien Sex Fiend: Er.. Chris, can you lend
me six quid? (grovel, grovel)
Christ: SIX QUID !!!
Inside the theatre...
Pendragon: W h o wants some popcorn?
All: Munch, m u n c h , munch...
There follows various comments,
including, but not limited to: 'Cor!
Wouldn't mind seeing that!', 'Adam, get
me a ticket to that. Now!', 'Hah! I've
already got the press release!', and
'Double Hah! I've already seen it!' etc,
etc.
The film starts...
Pendragon: Cor! It's just like the book!
A S F : I've never read it. What happens?
Pendragon: Heathen!
Christ: M y god! Look at those suits!
A S F : Yep, it appears that silver is 'in' in
2031! Sexy car! It's some concept thing
that some Italian company made
sometime ago. I think...'
There follows a stunned silence at the
level of tackiness contained within the
time travel sequence...
A S F : Mmm... I didn't realise that the
monster could talk...
Pendragon: That's 'cos y o u haven't read
the book, heathen!
Christ: This is crap... m u n c h , munch.
A S F : H a n g on. Does this mean that they
expect us to believe that 'ole Franky-stein
was a real guy, or that he's gone back to
an alternate reality, or just that the film's
crap...?
Pendragon: ..and what's Mary Shelly
doing in her o w n book?
Christ: This is crap... m u n c h , munch.
A short time and several dodgy scenes
later...
All: Urghhh...That was a bit yukky!
Christ: ...and crap... pass the popcorn.
Another pause...
A S F : Here! That's the guy from Lost
Boys, you know, the older brother?
Pendragon: No it's not, it's L o r d Byron!
A S F : Who's that?
Pendragon: Heathen! Here! That's Kylie's
boyfriend! Y o u k n o w , the guy from INXS!
A S F: No it's not, it's that poet Shelley!
Hah!
Pendragon: Heathen!
Some time (and film) passes, then Mary
Shelley says 'Percy and Byron preach
free love. I practice it...'
A S F: Is this ridiculous or what? No-one's
ever said that to me!
Pendragon: Well, maybe you haven't met
another cave-women yet...
Christ: Crap acting...
Pause...
Christ: W H A D D Y A M E A N , T H E R E ' S NO
P O P C O R N LEFT!!! Well, that's it, I'm
leaving!
(He doesn't go)
Pendragon: T o u c h of the Back to the
Futures about this...
Christ: This is really sad (and crap).
Another tacky and equally crap time
travel sequence follows...
Pendragon: O h dear.
A S F: I don't believe it!
Christ: This is crap.
The film ends...
Christ: I need a drink...Pub?
All: O h , if y o u force us...!
In the Pub...
All: Yes, that really was crap!
Pendragon: How's your beer, Chris?
Christ: That's crap too.
And so it goes...
Alien Sex Fiend, Pendragon, and
Christ.
