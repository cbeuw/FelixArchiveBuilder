POP GOES
COMSAT ROCK
With four albums to their credit
and a near-top billing at the
recent Futurama in Leeds the
Comsat Angels are still waiting
for their big breakthrough.
Tonight (Friday) they play the
Union Concert Hall. Support is
The Group and admission is
£2.50.
The industrial sound recently associated with music
from the north of England is gradually d i s a p p e a r i n g ^
many of the serious young men who created it move o n
to pastures new. New Order have discovered extended
discomixes and chart hits, E c h o & the Bunneymen,
Stratford-upon-Avon, the Albert Hall and T O T P a n d
now the Comsat Angels have been converted (or
coerced) to the religion of pure pop.
Coming from Sheffield they are keenly aware of its
possibilities following the success of close neighbours
the Human League and A B C . Mind it hasn't always
been like that.
Their first album WAITING FOR A MIRACLE was a
spartanly produced and bleak if strangely satisfying
effort, although never essential like several of its
contemporaries. However memorable tracks included
opener Missing In Action, an uptempo number
dominated by siren guitar playing and the 'lost in blast
attack' refrain and Independence Day.
Follow-up SLEEP NO MORE suffered what now
would be called delusions of Bunneymen-syndrome. All
very serious, the consistent first side contained some
fine songs, notably Eye Dance and Dark Parade but the
second side descended into a morass of drum heavy
songs.
Third album FICTION was a critical success and the
live shows at the time received similar acclaim.
However lack of success caused Polydor to drop the
band so they joined C B S subsidiary Jive—primarily a
dance orientated label—and trusted the production of
their fourth album LAND to Mike Howlett (responsible
for the chart success C h i n a Crisis, O M D and Flock of
Seagulls).
Again the album vacillated between g o o d and bad.
Ironically the new producer seemed to wake up the
band on several tracks—Will You Stay Tonight and
Alicia (Can you hear me) are positively uplifted by the
cleaner more professional production and the drums
bite whereas before they only sounded. Independence
Day from the first album is re-recorded for this album
and it is indicitive of the songs quality that it sounds
good under both regimes. Likewise A World Away
would be a terrible song performed in any style whilst
Nature Trails and / Know That Feeling are typical, of
Howlett's worst: raindrop keyboards, gently rippling
rhythms and abysmal lyrics.
A notable change of direction is Mister Memory a
vicious chunk of thunder-funk and new single Island
Heart which is reminiscent of Teardrop Explodes at
their best. Elsewhere the shadow of the Human League
(Phil Oakey's vocals in particular) is apparent but how
all of this—past punks experimenting with p o p
.sensibilities—will transfer to the live stage is not so
obvious.
