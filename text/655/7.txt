CAREERS
After the milk round?
'What happens now that I've failed to get a job on the
milk round?' This is the worrying question that many
students face after the round of second interviews. However
there are other ways of finding a job. A recent survey showed
that the majority of graduates find jobs by other means. So
just what are the alternatives?
Through Advertisements
According to the survey the
number of people finding jobs
through advertisements was
almost as large as those finding a
job on the milk round. This
shouldn't really be a surprise
considering the number of publi-
cations crammed with job ads
that are issued by the profes-
sional institutions. So make sure
you join your relevant institution
and subscribe to their journal.
National publications may
also be used to find jobs. Despite
the fact many adverts require
experience, companies may
sometimes take new graduates if
they apply. If a job seems
interesting, apply.
Personnel Contacts
Believe it or not 14% of all
graduates gain jobs through
friends or relatives. Presumably
this is mainly because relatives
might say that a certain company
is taking on graduates rather than
people being employed in their
father's firm, so keep your ears
open. Your parents may actually
know more than you think.
Speculative Applications
Many people find jobs by writing
.to firms who they know employ
graduates in the areas they are
interested in. Sources of informa-
tion about firms who are likely to
employ graduates include the

careers advisory service and
directories like GO (Graduate
Opportunities) and DOG (Direc-
tory of Opportunities for Gradu-
ates). However these directories
can at times concentrate on
technological jobs and account-
ancy.
If you decide to make some
speculative applications make
sure they are well written. The
letter should say what areas of
work you are interested in and
should be accompanied by a CV
(which should be brief and
preferably typed).
Vacancies Advertised by the
Careers Service
As with all large colleges and
universities Imperial has an ex-
tensive careers service. Make sure
that you actually use it as it will
probably have much better con-
tacts, resources, etc than you.
Don't forget that your depart-
ment may well be able to provide
you with some form of careers
advice. This is especially useful in
engineering departments where
staff will have an extensive
knowledge of industry.
Sponsorship
As this is a technological college,
many students are sponsored. If
you are sponsored, why not try
and persuade your sponsors to
employ you? After all they have
invested a lot of money in
training you and they do know
more about you than any other
company does.
Summer Recruitment Fair
Although Imperial does not host
one of these, many universities
hold fairs for firms who have
vacancies in the summer. The
career's service will be able to tell
you where these are being held as
you will certainly be able to
attend fairs at other universities.
While you may not actually get
a job at the fair it will certainly
give you some more ideas.
Hopefully this article has been
of use in that it has suggested
some sources of jobs that you had
not thought about. However this
list is not definitive, so use any
possible source and you will
probably find a job. Good luck.
