JOB APPLICATIONS AND INTERVIEWS
Many people, although they are excellently qualified for a
job fail to get it because they sell themselves short in the
initial stages. Application forms, CVs and interviews are not
the best way of telling whether someone is suitable for a job.
They are however the only realistic way for employers to
select from the hundreds of applicants for a job. If you are to
get the sort of job you really want it is essential for you to be
able to do well in these areas.
The Application
Employers may have to sift
through up to 10,000 application
forms and so something about
your form has got to make them
want to meet you, rather than the
other 9,999 people. Before you
start, you've got to believe in
yourself. You've got to identify
why you're better than average.
So you're ordinary are you? You
can't be. No two 'ordinary'
people are the same, so which
one's ordinary and anyway,
nobody ordinary gets into
Imperial!
The application form is usually
the only guide that prospective
employers have as to who you
are. Before they read the form,
they won't know that you're an
absolute whizz at Quantum
Mechanics but a real bore at
parties or, on the other hand, that
you're destined for a third but are
loved by students and tutors alike
for your sunny personality and
sparkling wit. There are careers
for both.
Your first hurdle then, is to
make the employers read the
form. If it's illegible, grubby,
crumpled, covered in blotches or
if it's uneasy on the eye for any
reason, the chances are they
won't bother to read it and they'll
never find out what a nice person
you are.
After reading the form, the
employers still won't have found
out unless you've told them. So
answer all the questions as fully
but as succinctly as possible and
don't be too afraid of letting your
character show through.
So you don't play sport and
you don't have any hobbies, you
just like mooching about with
your mates in the bar. Rather
than writing 'none' or 'drinking'
in the hobbies gap, you could put
'After a full day studying, I enjoy
relaxing in the company of good
friends discussing anything from
the Waldorf case to the meaning
of life', well something like that.
Be positive. Don't tell lies, but
bear in mind the 'half empty, half
full' example.
It's a good idea to tailor your
form to the particular job you're
applying for by emphasising the
more relevant aspects of your life
to date. When you are applying
to a high technology company do
stress your most relevant courses
and experiences. If you're apply-
ing to a department store for a
management traineeship, expand
on your Saturday morning shelf-
filling at Tescos but merely
mention briefly the summer
packing sweets. However, if
you're applying to a confec-
tionery manufacturer, it's vice
versa.
As for the ghastly questions
like 'Why do you want to work
for us?, avoid the temptation to
put T don't particularly' or 'for
the money'. Think about the
company, about the job and
about why you chose to apply.
The Curriculum Vitae
The CV is your opportunity to
answer questions you wish you
were asked on the application
form. You should use the oppor-
tunity to really sell yourself. As
' well as vital statistics and previ-
ous education you should
emphasise positions of
responsibility and authority you
have held.
CVs tend to be even more
boring to read in quantity than
application forms, so your C V
should be clear, concise and free
of all spelling and grammatical
errors.
The Interview
But my hope is all gone,
Got the fears comin' on
And III die
Cause I'm crippled with nerves.
I Dury
Everybody gets nervous how-
ever coolthey may seem. A friend
of mine always takes out her
contact lenses when she's going
to a nerve-racking event and it's
true, she always looks calm, cool
and aloof, until she walks into the
piano! So don't panic. Most
interviewers will allow for your
nerves and it may help if you
remember that the interviewers
are quite likely to be just as
nervous as you.
It helps if you've done your
homework. Read through your
application form (you did keep a
copy didn't you) and think of
questions you might be asked.
Find out about the company
and make sure you let the
interviewer know that you've
taken the trouble to find out.
Relax and enjoy yourself. Tell
the interviewer about yourself,
about why you're unique, about
why you want the job a'ld win
you're just right for it. If he
appears to ask you a question in
Russian which you don't under-
stand, say so. Most interviewers
are not out to trick you, they're,
there to find out about you and
see if you'd be right for the post
so, go on, sell yourself!
