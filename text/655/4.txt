CAREERS FAIR
The Industrial Society and the Careers Adyisory Service are once again presenting a 'Careers Information Fair' on
Wednesday 2 November. Sixty employers will be here for you to approach in the JCR or the Great Hall.
The nationalised concerns will be here in force this year: British Telecom, Steel, Gas and Rail suggesting that they may
have more vacancies to talk about in 1984. Oil companies whose recruitment was slight in 1983 appear to be entering the
market again. The financial concerns, particularly the banks and accountants, have already notified us of large numbers of
vacancies for 1984 graduates and so have Her Majesty's Forces.
Below is given a list of employers who will be attending the Careers Fair. After the title, a brief description of the
organisations main activities is provided and, in brackets, the main departments from which they will be hoping to recruit
graduates. This is not absolutely binding in every case and it may well be worth making an enquiry even if the letter
corresponding to your department (as indicated in the key below) does not appear next to the employer's name.
