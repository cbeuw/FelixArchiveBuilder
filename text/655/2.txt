THE CAREERS ADVISORY SERVICE
A wide range of services are available to undergraduate
and postgraduate students of the College and to those who
have graduated from IC through the Careers Advisory
Service. Careers Advisers are able to give advice at several
stages. These include an analysis of your aptitude for various
occupations; the search for information about specific
careers or suitable employers, job applications and selection
interviews and the pros and cons of offers of employment or
postgraduate study.
Information is available in the
Careers Library (Rooms 310 and
311 Sherfield) about a wide range
of careers. This includes Inform-
ation Booklets on 70 career areas
and details of the membership
requirements of professional
bodies, prospectuses of post-
graduate courses and reference
books on a wide range of
subjects. Local lists of graduate
employers are available for those
wishing to work in specific areas
of the country.
A considerable quantity of
information is readily available
on a large number of employers
which usually includes their
annual report and graduate re-
cruitment literature. Copies of
the directories of employers:
Register of Graduate Employ-
ment and Training (ROGET),
Graduate Employment and
Training (GET), Graduate Op-
portunities (GO) and Directory
of Opportunities for Graduates
(DOG) are freely available on a
'take away' basis.
Employers send us details of
the vacancies they expect to have
and these can be seen in a
document called 'Forward
Vacancies', in our 'Employers'
Requirements' files and com-
puter print-out in which they are
analysed by degree discipline,
type of work and employer.
The Careers Advisory Service
arranges or participates in many
events at which students and
employers can meet. The 'Grad-
uate Recruitment Programme' is
perhaps the most important of
these when around 250 industrial
and commercial employers and
some parts of the scientific civil
service visit the College to
conduct selection interviews.
Fifty .of these employers give
evening presentations at 6:00pm
at which they indicate the oppor-
tunities they are offering and
discuss matters informally over a
beer. Some employers are invited
to take part in our series of lunch-
time careers talks. This year talks
relevant to particular courses are
being held in departments at
1:30pm on Thursdays and those
of more general interest at the
same time on Tuesdays.
We strongly recommend final
year students to attend the
careers evenings organised by the
Old Boys' Association. Many IC
graduates with a few years'
experience in a wide variety of
careers attend these functions
and they present a unique oppor-
tunity to discuss career areas with
people engaged in those activities
themselves.
This year we are holding the
second Careers Information Fair
organised jointly by the Indus-
trial Society and the Careers
Advisory Service. Some 60 em-
ployers will be present and again
the opportunity to talk to a large
variety of employers should not
be missed.
For those who leave job
seeking until after finals there are
a range of facilities to assist their
job search. Employers visit the
University again in June for the
Summer Fair at which they aim
to. fill some of their remaining
vacancies. Lists of job vacancies
are published in 'Current Vacan-
cies' and 'Job Opportunities
Bulletin'. Vacancies notified di-
rect to the College are displayed
in the Careers Advisory Service
and on relevant departmental
noticeboards.
On Wednesday afternoons a
series of in-depth two and a half
hour workshops are held on
Career Choice and the graduate
job market, job applications and
selection interview techniques.
Students who experience diffi-
culty in these areas can benefit a
great deal from these.
If indecision persists College
careers advisers have a range of
questionnaires which can be
useful. Commerical vocational
guidance consultants nearly
always start off the process with
these and finish by directing you
to a specific job function. We, on
the other hand, tend to use them
only when there is need and our
judgement indicates that they will
be of value. They range from
computer aptitude tests to inter-
est guides and a computer
assisted job matching process
called Gradscope. The results of
these may not be spectacularly
significant but an analysis i
factors which lead
extremely valuable.

Vacation Work
The Careers Advisory Service
also tries to assist those of you
interested in undertaking vacar
tion work relevant to your
degree. This is done through the
. Vacation Training Scheme and a
pamphlet outlining the scheme is
available. Each year we write to a
large number of companies who
send us details of the kind of
summer employment they can
offer. The Vacation Training
Representatives in your depart-
ment will be pleased to tell you
more. If you cannot locate him or
her please contact the Careers
Office, Rom 309, Sherfield Build-
ing. Vacation jobs abroad are
also on offer through a related
scheme called the International
Association for the Exchange of
Students for Technical Experi-
ence (IAESTE). These are quite
competitive to obtain—just 22
vacancies last year—and they are
not all in the USA or Europe.
Last summer students visited
Libya, South Africa, Australia,
Japan and a wide range of other
countries under the auspices of
IAESTE.
