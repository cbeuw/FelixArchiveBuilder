CAREER DECISIONS
Career decisions are not the easiest we have to make. Some
would have you believe that making a career choice is simply
a matter of facts and figures. Students of science and
engineering—so the senario goes— need only the names and
addresses of suitable employers plus other suitable informa-
tion and a career will automatically follow.
Others find career decisions hard because they have
difficulty in visualising what life outside education can be
like and hesitate to take this 'jump into the dark'.
All of these are, in my view,
misconceptions. It is worth re-
membering what the important
factors in your last major career
decision were—the move from
school to university. Some may
have been facts to do with the A
Level grades required, the size of
the department or the content of
the course. Others will have been
feelings including considerable
interest in certain subjects and a
satisfaction gained from studying
them. Being more at home in
certain environments than other:
city versus green field universities
may have been significant, or
sheer prejudice that certain
courses are unsuitable based on
hearsay rather than evidence.
Choosing a career after gradu-
ation is not so different but by
then you have had more experi-
ence to help you in making your
decisions. Some of the subjects
studied within your degree course
may have fired your enthusiasm
much more than others and an
interest in persuing a career
concerned with these may grow.
You may decide that your future
career should not be related in
any way to your degree subject.
Certain activities within the
course may have been much more
enjoyable than others.
Many of you have had experi-
ence of employment already
whether it is working in a shop or
fruit picking, laboratory work or
on a construction site. Did you
learn anything about your adapt-
ability to various situations and
environments or the ways in
which the activities of others can
impinge on your work?
Spare time interests and hob-
bies often reinforce the clues we
find elsewhere. Those who enjoy
experimental work may be in-
volved in other activities of a
practical nature. Problem solvers
may enjoy puzzles or crosswords,
chess and bridge are often of
interest to those who gain satis-
faction from the analysis of
situations.
These are just some of the
facets of your life so far which are
worth considering before making
a career choice. Writing lists of
these factors which are important
for you and which you do not
enjoy or at which you cannot
excel can be a useful exercise.
Having considered these care-
fully and added other important
points which occur to you the
time arrives when you are ready
to consider what employment is
available which allows the ex-
pression of your main interest
and talents.
Unless you have a wide em-
ployment experience it is best to
consult a careers adviser at this
stage because you may have
overlooked an occupation which
allows you to combine most of
your strengths and which you
could find satisfying. If an
MCAREERS
occupation suggests itself about
which you know very little it will
be necessary to do some research.
Read some of the literature
available in the Careers Advisory
Service. There are some seventy
information booklets available
covering most of the careers you
could think of. The Register of
Graduate Employment and
Graduate Opportunities includes
some job information. Take the
opportunities which present
themselves to meet employers
with an interest in the kind of
work you have in mind. If
possible arrange to talk to
someone who is doing the job.
It is possible to analyse work
and its content in order to decide
the kind of qualifications, skills
and qualities of character which
are required. This is of course an
extremely difficult task if you
have a limited knowledge of the
job area but by asking others for
their views you can look at
employment in this way and
begin the process of matching
your talents to those required by
employers for specific posts. For
some of you this will be a
straightforward exercise; but do
not be dissillusioned if it proves
to be quite a tough problem. This
is an area in which the Careers
Advisory Service is particularly
geared to assist you.
