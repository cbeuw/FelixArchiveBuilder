FURTHER EDUCATION
IS IT REALLY THE THING FOR YOU?
Over recent years the number of graduates applying for
postgraduate courses has continued to rise. It would be nice
to think this is due to better teaching and greater interest at
undergraduate level. The realistic view must be, that with
jobs for graduates becoming harder to obtain many people
are turning to postgraduate study as an alternative. With
typical government logic, as the demand for places increases,
so the number of financially supported places decreases.
Gone are the days when a 2(i) was the passport to post-
graduation acceptance.
There are three main options
open to graduates seeking post-
graduate education. A PhD
entails three years of original
research which is written up as a
thesis and presented to a panel of
external examiners. A number of
departments also insist on the
attendance at a number of
lectures a year, some make the
passing of exams at the end of the
first year a requirement for
continuing further.
The MSc is a one year course,
usually a mixture of lectures,
exams and a project of about
three months duration.
For those wishing to go into
teaching there is the Postgradu-
ate Certificate of Education
(PGCE). This is a one year course
combining lectures, exams,
essays and fieldwork in the
classroom.
These then are the options,
why do people apply for them?
i) An interest in a certain
aspect of their undergraduate
education has stimulated a
desire to investigate the subject
further.
ii) To pursue a certain
career further qualifications
are necessary (particularly for
teaching).
Hi) As an alternative to join-
ing the job hunt or to cover a
period of indecision.
The best and most successful
postgraduate candidate will be
motivated by a mix of reasons
one and two. A postgraduate
degree doesn't guarantee jobs
(10% of last year's PGCE stu-
dents are still unemployed). To
study a subject because "1 enjoy
it", still leaves a problem with
what to do when you finish and
those who do postgraduate study
as an easy option are invariably
doomed to fail. Don't be mis-
taken, postgraduate work isn't
easy. It often involves long hours,
working weekends and the basic
financial reward is poor. The
grant for a single postgraduate in
London is £2,995 for a 50 week
year.
Supposing you're still inter-
ested how do you go about
getting a place? For MSC and
PGCE courses, apply directly to
the college or department that
offers the course you wish to
follow. They may well accept you
but won't gurantee financial
support, a very important con-
sideration!! For a PhD there are
two options. One is to write to a
department that is currently
working on your field of interest
and see if they have money
available for a postgraduate
student. The alternative is to wait
until March/April when the
grant awarding bodies produce
their grant awards for the coming
year, and then write to the
departments/supervisors receiv-
ing them. A word of warning, do
not rely on the promise of getting
money at a later date. Invariably
the 'promised' money won't
materialise and you'll be left with
an unfinanced place and it being
too late to apply elsewhere (per-
sonal experience).
In January I intend to run an
informal meeting/seminar, for
all final year undergraduates
interested in postgraduate study,
so your questions can be
answered by people who have
been through, are in, or supervise
postgraduate work. If before
then, you require any
information or advice please do
not hesitate to contact me via the
Union Office.
