Moonie-rakers!
Members of the Unification
Church, the Moonies, have been
canvassing in the College area this
week. Several posters have been
spotted announcing that the
'Collegiate Association for the
Research of Principles (CARP)'
will be meeting students between
15th and 21st February.
Following this, members of the
cult were seen trying to recruit
students coming into College
along Exhibition Road and
yesterday they had set up a
recruitment base outside the
Mechanical Engineering
Department.
Followers of the cult have been
banned from College premises by
College Security. Security Officer Mr
Terry Briley told FELIX that he was
only able to escort members of CARP
off College premises and that he could
do little if they set up a base on the
pavement outside College. It was only
in the power of the police to move
them on if they were causing an
obstruction or nuisance. He also said
that Moonies regularly try to recruit
students in South Kensington at this
time of year.
The Unification Church is an
umbrella organisation funded by the
Korean millionaire Sun Myung Moon
and operates under at least sixty
different names throughout the world.
The movement has been widely
criticised for using brainwashing
indoctrination techniques and
' A CARPie trying to persuade an IC student outside the Mech Eng Dept
exploiting young people. They are
giving out pamphlets to passing
students which make no mention that
CARP is linked with the Moonies.
CARP say that they 'are trying to
demonstrate that is realistic to be
idealistic' and that its members
'passionately believe that the world
can change for the better.' The
invitations to 'come and join us for
an evening of international songs,
entertainmentâ€”and snacks' all seem
innocent enough but students are
warned that CARP is a sinister
organisation which feeds on the
loneliness and unhappiness of people.
Honorary Secretary Chas Jackson
said yesterday T don't like the idea
of religious fanatics running around
my campus without revealing their
true identity'. He has added his
backing to College Security and
believes that they are completely right
in denying access to the cult.
STOP PRESS
St Mary's students have voted
that their student union should
become the fourth Constituent
College Union of Imperial College
Union when the two colleges
merge in August this year. The
votes cast were 223 for the move
and 61 against.
