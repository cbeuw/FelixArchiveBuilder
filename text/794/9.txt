Hellraiser
The British equivalent to 'The Evil
Dead', but much better. This film is
gory - very gory - but the ideas
within it are excellent. It's the most
original horror film to come out in
years. Hire it if you can!
The Fly
Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, a
scientist whose matter transporter
splices his genes with those of a
common house fly, initiating a slow,
terrifying metamorphosis, still loved
by his faithful girlfriend. The video
release of "The Fly' is reputedly going
to contain some scenes that were
edited from the cinema version of the
film. But it's not the gore that's
important - it's the tragic love story
that makes this film so haunting and
sad.
Bulletproof
Gary Busey, so good as the principle
bad guy M r Joshua in 'Lethal
Weapon', stars in this pretty
ridiculous set-piece action mayhem
movie. It really stretches the
imagination, requiring you to believe
that the PLO, a Soviet commando unit
and a helicopter gunship are moving
freely in a large wilderness slice of
the Mexican countryside. The plot is
bare to say the least, and wholly
implausible, existing simply to
support various badly executed action
scenes. Give 'Bulletproof a miss. See
'Robocop' instead for action and
adventure.
Crime Story
From the director of couple of
episodes of 'Miami Vice' and the
recendy released 'West Side Story'
rip off 'China Girl' comes a two hour
saga of slickly put together violence
and 'Godfather' —like wheeling and
dealing and sub—plot. This work
attempts to do what most American
crime series don't: have violence, but
try to actually incorporate some
characterisation and plot
development. It isn't as good as "The
Godfather', but is alright
nevertheless, and is good
entertainment if you're really hard up
for soemthing to hire.
SINGLES STILL
'Suede Head'-Morrisey
If you are still in a state of despair
after the demise of 'The Smiths',
grieve no more.
Radio One DJ and general good egg
John Peel has been previewing
Morrissey's new single, and what an
absolute gem it is.
The A side, 'Suede Head', and one
of the B side tracks, curiously titled
'Hairdresser on Fire', are not a
million miles away from 'Queen is
Dead' from 'The Smiths'. The other
B side track, T Know Very Well How
I Got My Name' is the most charming
track on the disc, and bears more than
a passing resemblance to 'I Won't
Share You' off the last 'Smiths' album
'Strangeways Here We Come'.
The combination of Steven Street,
• Vini Reilly and Morrissey promises
to be equally good as "The Smiths'.
Fingers crossed, the album should
follow soon. Watch this space!
'Cold Sweat'-The
Sugarcubes
Iceland? Iceland! Well, 'ABBA' were
from Sweden, afterall, so is this a
revival in the fortunes of the
Scandinavian rock industry? (Has
Scandinavia got a rock industry?)
Anyway, that apart, the winners of
the prestigious Number One spot in
John Peel's Festive Fifty follow up
the brilliant 'Birthday' with the
equally brilliant 'Coldsweat'.
Not as Cocteaus—esque (What!? —
Charlie) as 'Birthday', 'Cold Sweat'
is more direct, with a guitar sound
layered over a firm bass/drum beat,
and that voice, so frail and yet so
powerful.
With Gary Davis giving it a good
airing on the National Number One
radio station, this could be a
chart—bound—sound soon.
So you see, there's more to Iceland
than Magnus Magnusson and
volcanoes!

PLAYING
'Predator' (Cert. 18)
The blurb says something about 'it'
hunting for sport and killing for
pleasure. What's the problem?
Doesn't man do exactly the same
thing?
'Robocop' (Cert.18)
If you haven't seen this, you're
missing out on a hundred minutes of
sheer great entertainment. GO AND
SEE IT!
'Cry Freedom' (Cert.PG)
Richard Attenborough's film on
Stephen Biko, set in South Africa.
Good, admirably-intentioned, but
ends up by being more about whites
than blacks.
'The Dead' (Cert.U)
John Huston's last film, based on the
short story by James Joyce.
•Maurice' (Cert. 15)
Based on E M Forster's suppressed
novel about a homosexual affair. Well
directed and acted.
'Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'
(Cert.18)
A film about the disintegration of
Britain under the current
Government, with a lot of internal
anger, yet doesn't quite make it.

i Hamburger Hill
The film that rivalled with 'Platoon'
and 'Full Metal Jacket' to be THE
movie about Vietnam. It's a shocker,
all about a completely insignificant
hill that became the site of one of the
biggest blood baths in Vietnam,
simply because the kill ratio of
American to Vietnamese soldiers was
good.
