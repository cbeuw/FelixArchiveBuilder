Happy New Year to all our Chinese
students at Imperial. May the Year of
the Dragon be as good as the last.
I hear that the weather's been good
all this week. Could the Union please
put a sunlamp in my basement?
Rag—who gives the money?
Something has been concerning me
recently. Imperial's Rag Committee
has been the strongest and keenest for
several years and is going to raise the
largest amount for charity ever this
year. This is excellent and deserves
the highest praise in the world.
Charity work gives students a good
name, yes, but should we be
collecting amongst ourselves or out
in the community? There have been
an abundance of sponsored events this
year: the Piano Marathon, the Firkin
Runs, the Bed Push, etc, etc. All the
money raised from such sponsored
events comes from Imperial students,
who can ill-afford it and are probably
getting a little sick of being accosted
by their friends who want their
signatures and, eventually, their
money. I think, as an ex-Vice
President of the Rag Committee, that
it is time to put aside sponsored events
in favour of events which raise money
whilst entertaining. Alternatively,
arranging more public collections. Of
course, this would require much more
work than organising sponsored
events, but with the new Honorary
Secretary (Events) this shouldn't be
a problem, should it?
Letters
Why did the MOPSOC and AstroSoc
committees demand that their letter be
printed in this week's FELLX and why
did I print it? Normally I wouldn't
print a letter like theirs as I feel that
such letters should only be written if
all verbal reasoning has failed. I
printed it because I would have been
open to all sorts of criticisms about
censorship of embarrassing letters if
I hadn't. I don't invite criticism. I
invite constructive debate. I would
prefer any clubs who do have gripes
against the Print Unit to come and talk
to me, in my capacity as Print Unit
Manager, and if you don't feel happy
with my explanations, then write to
FELIX.
On the other hand, if you have
criticisms about the content of
FELIX, please write in straight away.
Don't write articles for C C U
magazines, especially if you're going
to get your facts wrong.
Is FELIX the SUN of student
newspapers?
Try comparing the news story we ran
on Ian Howgate's name change last
week to the one in The Sun on
Monday. Nuff said.
CARP
CARP is a branch of the Moonies and
they have been approaching Imperial
College students once more this year.
It happens every year. If you are
approached by CARP on College
premises, please inform security so
that they can throw them off.
Who cares
I find the Union Council's I attend
more and more disheartening. I think
that most of the members are more
like those nodding dogs that you see
in the back of cars rather than Union
officers. The only people who ask
questions at these meetings are,
coincidentally (?), those who are
standing in this year's sabbatical
elections, and even these people ask
drivilly questions.
The Council on Monday was a
prime example of this phenomenon. x
One person asked the recurring
question: 'When is Ian Howgate
going to write a report for FELIX?'
Ian replied 'I'm not' and not a single
person asked him to justify why he
wasn't, given that all past presidents
have written a regular report. Is no
one concerned? Does anybody want
to know what Mr Howgate does with
his 8 hours Monday to Friday? If you
do then I would urge you to ask him
at Tuesday extraordinary Union
General Meeting in the JCR.
GERBILL
What is GERBILL and why should
every IC student be concerned about
it. GERBILL is the Great Educational
Reform Bill proposed by Kenneth
Baker but that's about all most of us
know about it. There are some pretty
scary implications to it, though, if all
the proposals go through. For
instance, the Government want to
completely restructure the way
universities receive their funding.
They want to fund departments
individually. But who will fund the
Union? There are so many other
points to be considered, and possibly,
opposed. Please read page 4 to find
out more and turn up to the UGM
next Tuesday to discuss the Bill and
its implications.
Finally...
We still have a few sweatshirts and
t-shirts left!
