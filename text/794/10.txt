MUSIC
by Phil Young
This looks like a big week for the
indie/thrash/shambling/garage/call-it-
what-you-like scene. Kicking off are
the Bodeans, proving that the
Americans can do it just as well as us
(thrash and shamble, that is), at ULU
tonight, plugging their album Outside
Looking In and their debut UK single
Dreams. Along the same line are the
Wedding Present, playing London for
the firt time since their album George
Best hit the big time. Supporting them
at the Town and Country Club,
tonight, are the Close Lobsters and the
Flatmates—yes, more of the same,
but the Close Lobsters are about the
best of their ilk, and manage to keep
their musical influences hidden, with
more variety than most. Finally
tonight Alien Sex Fiend provide a
welcome break with punky rock
sounds, at the Astoria's Apocalypse
Club, which opens at 11pm
On Sunday the Woodentops play
Brixton Academy. Emerging from yet
more shambling indie thrash, they
now inject much more variety into
their sound, incorporating some
pleasant surprises. Adding to the
variety are the support— Yargo
playing hard, jazzy soul, and African
Headcharge with hip-hoppish reggae.:
Album Review
The Godfathers: Birth, School,
Work, Death
Hit by Hit, the compilation of their
first four singles on Corporate Image,
took the indie charts by storm this
time last year. This album, released
on Epic, promises to do the same to
the mainstream charts. The opening
number—the title track—is the good
old no-nonsense rock we expect from
the Godfathers with bitter lyrics
which encompass politics, drugs, sex
and the futility of it all. Then there
come some surprises; the next songs
sound more like the harder Rolling
Stones with twenty years' worth of
evolution. The music and lyrics are
abrupt, with such tried and tested rock
themes as drugs and love, with a
humourous arrogance. Totally out of
character is When am I corning down,
which is purely psychedelic and
brilliant. The second side resorts to
what the Godfathers are best at, pure,
arrogant, protesting hard rock, with
vocalist Peter Coyne asserting his
personal rebellion. A possible
reference to the arms race is followed
by more good old rock lyrics about
love. This album is a masterpiece of
uncompromising Clash-style hard
rock with none of the pretentious
machismo of heavy metal. Undiluted,
earthy and with a damn good rhythm.
RACING
by Paul Shanley
The observant amongst you will have
noticed racing tips appearing in this
august journal in the past few weeks.
The only problem with this is that
FELIX deadlines are such that the
weekend selections have to be made
on a Thursday morning. Inevitably,
this means that some non-runners are
bound to slip through the net.
Last week's batch produced three
non-runners. However, the other
selection came up trumps with
Playschool beating the odds-on
favourite Forgive 'n' Forget by a
commanding eight lengths to win the
Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown on
Saturday.
Joe Coral now makes Playschool
4-1 favourite to take the Cheltenham
Gold Cup on St Patrick's Day. An
interesting showdown with Cavvies
Clown is promised here subject to
clearance by the Jockey Club on
doping allegations. Watch this space
nearer the Cheltenham Festival for
more news.
Looking further ahead, the weights
are now available for the Grand
National on April 9th. The
handicapper has been a bit tough on
last year's third placed Lean Ar
Aghaidh who starts a stone heavier
than his '87 trip.
Last year's runner-up The
Tsarevich looks to be the best bet at
the weights. The 12-year old is 91b
better than Lean Ar Aghaidh and will
take some beating. 25-1 is being
offered ante-post at Corals and
Mecca.
It doesn't look like there will be any
major upsets this year but the best
outsider seems to be The Tsarevich's
stable-mate Galway Blaze—Hennesy
winner of '85. Latest word from Nick
Henderson's yard is that he has a
50-50 chance of making it to Aintree.
One to watch.
This week's tips appear in the news
pages.
JF00TBALL
by Adrian Grainger
Arsenal vs Manchester Utd.
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
This is billed as the game of the day
and along with the all Merseyside
clash, the Cup will lose two of its
favourites. The equivalent league
meeting produced a victory for the
Reds of Old Trafford, so the Gunners
will be eager for revenge. The two
clubs have good Cup records (6 final
appearances in the last 10 years
between them) and 11 Cup victories
in their histories. (33 semi-finals as.
well!) If a football fan is asked which
final he remembers most, then the
mind flashes back to 1979. Arsenal
at 2-0 looked invincible with five
minutes to go, but United pulled it
back to 2-2 only for Sunderland to
poke the ball home for an Arsenal
victory, real Roy of the Rovers stuff.
Those days are gone but Rocastle,
Groves, Adams et al should repeat the
'79 triumph over Fergie's men to give
London a strong chance of another
Cup victory. Arsenal to win in a
thriller.
QPR vs Luton Town
Loftus Road (White City tube)
This is a pseudo derby game, putting
two of the top sides of Division One
in a Cup game, with a place in the last
8 to fight for. Rangers disposed of
West Ham in the previous round and
are feeling confident that this will be
their year again to reach the final.
They were defeated at Everton last
week with my tip for the top Paul
Parker putting through his own net.
The Hatters are used to playing on
plastic fantastic (I really mean that it's,
crap) and they must fancy their
chances with Mark Stein playing so
well, this will be a close game but
QPR should sneak it by the odd goal
in three.
Charlton vs Sheffield Wed.
Selhurst Park (Norwood Jtn tube)
Charlton still hold up Division One
and I wouldn't bet against them from
doing this come May-time.
Wednesday have been playing well
lately but were surprisingly
hammered 3-0 at Coventry last week.
This league meeting is more
important for the home team but
Wednesday will be eager to maintain
a top half placing. Charlton led
Wimbledon last week but had to settle
for a point. Sheffield have a good side
with Martin Hodge, Mark
Chamberlain and Lee Chapman
coming to mind. A draw is the most
probable result but look out for a
home win with a little bit of luck.
Millwall vs Oldham
The Den (New Cross tube)
The Lions are pushing for promotion
in a league where any of the top 11
must fancy their chances with a good
run in at the end of the season. A
good, close win from behind at
Reading last week kept Millwall in the
hunt with Sheringham notching up a
couple of goals. Joe Royle and his
Oldham side were never out of the top
3 in the league last year and were a
victim of the play-offs. This season
they have languished near the bottom
of the table, but a respectable mid-
table position looks likely. They lost
5-3 at Bradford last week with Andy
Ritchie grabbing two. Millwall to take
maximum points.
Fulham vs Walsall
Craven Cottage (Putney Bridge tube)
Fulham entertain a top side in this
Third Division game, who already
have 7 away victories and are looking
for 8. Fulham have a poor home
record and look on thin ice with this
one. Walsall are 3rd in the 3rd
(confused?) and have a poetical
midfielder in Craig Shakespeare and
ex-Man City striker Trevor Christie
upfront. Walsall have been pushing
for promotion for years and have
never quite made it. I hope that this
will be their year. Walsall to win and
gain promotion later on!
Leyton Orient vs Cardiff City
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
This is a real top of the table clash for
Division Four fans. Orient have fallen
a little recently with a close defeat at
Scunthorpe last week not helping
Frank Clark and his men at all.
Cardiff, a recent 4-1 away winner at
top of the table Wolves, are having
a great season and lie second at the
moment. The Welshmen have ex-
Southampton star Alan Curtis and ex-
Brummie Nicky Platnaver in their
squad and should prove strong
opposition. Cardiff to take at least a
point.
Game of the day: Arsenal vs Man
Utd.
My Cup last 8: Birmingham,
Wimbledon, QPR, Arsenal, Man
City, Port Vale, Portsmouth and
Liverpool.
A special mention for my hero Eddie
Edwards, jumping in the 90m ski-
jump at Calgary on Saturday. What
a star, what a competitor, what a prat!
