TENNIS
IC 2nds V I - 1
Queen's Club 2nds VI—5
The first 'friendly' tennis match for
the IC 2nds took place on Sunday
against Queen's Club. Conditions
were perfect, mild, a little sun and
most importantly no rain.
Unfortunately the scores show the
standard of play was far from perfect
with out first pair, Mark Lavelle and
Ken Cheung, winning the only rubber
against Queen's third pair. Queen's
first pair was strong but our lack of
match practice prevented more
success against the other two pairs.
Next weekend sees the match of IC
lsts VI against Queen's 1st VI. So,
with favourable weather, sweet
revenge is called for.
RUGBY
RCS A Team—16
Queen Mary College 2nds—14
Due to recent problems in raising a
second side, RCS Rugby has now
formed a temporary A side which
draws from the full RCS squad.
Once the visitors had arrived the A
team began to get in the mood, helped
by a rousing display by captain
Pertbucks. Such was the enthusiasm
that Bardiver-Dobson taped back his
vulcan ears. The game started off at
a fast pace and it took a while for RCS
to settle. Playing with the wind, much
ground was made with Bryn's boot
which spurred on the forwards who
dominated the loose ball.
Ten minutes into the game, out of
the blue, Queen Mary's scored and
converted a try. Not deterred by this
RCS put the pressure on and halfway
through the half their hard work paid
off when Spike Boyce went over. This
try was magnificently converted by
Stickman Magee.
The second half began badly—the
half-time lead of 12-6 was soon
whittled down to a 12-14 deficit after
two quick tries by Mary's. To add
injury to insult, halfway into the
second period, O'Donut had to leave
the field with a cream cake problem.
Luckily we had super-sub J Clayton
to come on.
As the match entered the closing
stages blood began to boil. Under the
influence of debut boy Bob Coutes in
tandem with Mouth Manning the pack
went from strength to strength and
were repeatedly within a few feet of
the line. The game climaxed 7
minutes into injury time when M
Fanshawe collected a poorly cleared
ball and touched down in the corner.
Seconds later the whistle went and
RCS recorded a memorable victory.
The racing season is here at last.
Serious training runs will set off from
Beit Arch at 2pm on Wednesday
afternoons starting this week; note
however that the Sunday morning
runs shall remain largely
touringorientated as usual. Riders of
all abilities are welcome to come
along and try their'hand.
A busy season of BSSF
Championships begins on March 10
TEN-PIN BOWLING
Last Wednesday, IC set out in
confident mood to tackle the mighty
Kent in their last UCTBA match.
Knowing that a good result could put
the team into contention for the
national finals, captain Paul Gaines
whipped his side into a bowling
frenzy.
Unfortunately by the time we had
arrived, after a 1x
k hour 'bum-
numbing' journey, much of this
fervour had disappeared. The match
started and soon the A, B and Ladies
squads were in deep trouble,
dramatically losing their first games
with only the C squad maintaining
some pride by destroying their Kent
counterparts (fine performances from
Ben Surtees, Cott Waye, Simon
Phillips and Martin Morris).
Although the B team shaded their
second game and the C squad carried
on with their impressive form, the A
and Ladies teams continued to
flounder and by the start of the third
games, IC faced the devastating
prospect of a humiliating defeat.
It was at this point that the true
with the ten-mile time trial in
Nottingham. It is hoped that we will
be able to field a stong team not only
in this event, but also in the
subsequent trial. Full details of all
events will follow shortly. In the
meantime, anyone interested should
contact me (Andy Major) through the
Physics pigeonholes, or come and see
me in B501, the Bessemer Building.

spirit of IC shone through. Instead of
heads dropping, the squad captains
spurred their team-mates on for one
last super-human effort. The C squad
finished their campaign the way they
had started by white-washing their
opponents and, with the 'B Boys'
rallying superbly to clinch their
contest (excellent scores from Paul
Young, Chi Chan and Steve
Russell—whose 197 contained eight
strikes!), four match points were in
the bag for IC.
Unfortunately, the A and Ladies
squads were by now in so much
trouble that four points were
guaranteed for Kent. This left the
remaining two match points resting on
the result of the A squad's final game.
Rising to the challenge Garman
Wong, Roger Hollamby and new boy
Bruce Nichols all fired in scores of
150+, leaving the skipper to
heroically secure the game (and a 5-5
match result) in a nail-biting last
frame 'bowl off with his opposite
number. A fine IC Performance.
HOCKEY
Eric's
difficult
balls
IC 3rds X I - 0
Old Creightonians 3rds XI—0
The first half was a very exciting 45
minutes with everyone slipping over
in the mud. Steve Burton got very
close to scoring. He was directly in
front of the goal and missed. He
blamed it on the ball dropping into a
divit. Spencer stood about on the
wing, hitting the ball about, and
occasionally giving the ball away.
Eric stopped some difficult balls. The
end of the second half was marked by
Shaun saving the ball with his box—
Ow! The second half was just as
eventful, Vish played with himself
most of the time, dribbling only a
short distance before losing the ball.
NB. The 2nds also drew 0-0.
IC Ladies—1
Kings—1
This is the first ladies hockey match;
to be played for three weeks due to
the weather. Both teams attacked, I
defended and stick tackled well. The I
breakthrough came twenty minutes
into the first half when Kings struck
a short corner well, good reflex action j
was however seen by Emma Pownall j
as she got out of the way of the ball1
before it hit the backboard. Not to be j
out-done IC replied when Sarah j
Hodgson took advantage of the free |
hit to put the ball across the goal
mouth, Penny Otway stopped the ball,!
drew the goalkeeper towards her
before deftly flicking the ball left
where Suzanne Astington made no
mistake as she scored the equalising
goal. After this the game returned to
mediocracy.
Many thanks to Mark Rayfield for
umpiring.
IC Ladies—1
Wye College—0
This was a quarter-final match of the j
University of London Colleges plate j
competition. IC with an understrength
side again had a very positive attitude.
The game again saw play at both ends
of the pitch. However good defensive j
play by Emma Pownall and midfield
may by Mary Faldon ensured Wyei
did not score. A flash of brilliance by I
Sandra Rofe produced the only goal
of the match.
Thanks to Deb's friend Sarah, for
playing.
