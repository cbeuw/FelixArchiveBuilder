Martin Cole reviews the new-look Guardian
Hailed in the publicity literature as the
latest in a long history of Guardian
newspaper innovations, the new-look
Guardian was launched on Friday,
12th February. The aim behind such
a radical change was to produce a
'clean, organised and thoroughly
user-friendly' newspaper, predictably
the letters page reveals a mixed
reaction.
With readership currently at 1.5
million and an increase of 65%
recorded in the last ten years, the
question of why was the new design
necessary must be asked. Editor,
Peter Preston, reasons that since both

the writers and readers change so
should the paper change to
accommodate this. New technology
offers the possibility of reducing those
'endearing typographical garbles' and
'grey mists of pictures', even at the
cost of upsetting readers for whom
such idiosyncrocies all go to form a
'flawed and fudgy friend'. More
cynically, however, the redesign is
seen by some as a rearguard action
against the loss of student readers to
the Independent. Though the
Guardian still boasts more readers
aged under 35 than any other quality
daily newspaper and perhaps,
conceitedly, the best educated
readership in the national press.
Before discussing the changes
perhaps I should, at this point, confess
that I am not infact a Guardian
reader. More by an accident of history
than choice it was always, whisper it
low, the Telegraph that lay in the
range of my young inquisitive ev
es.
At school in general studies, the
Guardian was branded as slightly left
of centre and thus to be read with
some degree of care. As a result it
received only the occasional curious
glance, at the risk of facing some
imagined ideological assault/
indoctrination. To this background of
pre-conceived thoughts, I was very
disappointed to finally read the
newspaper in earnest.
Visually the Guardian has all the
appearance of a Sunday newspaper.

doubt this has some aesthetic appeal
but it looks out of place. In the articles
the use of dropped capitals and lines
underneath stories 'give the reader a
clear indication of where to start and
finish a story'—a fact a reader would
hopefully realise without such clues!
Nonetheless these methods make the
page much more organised and
uncluttered than previously, giving
the overall effect of a European
newspaper. The lines, however, have
not had a favourable representation in
the trial-by-letters page currently in
progress.
Also under attack is the tendency
of the layout design to incorporate
white spaces rather than the more
common practice of packing every
page full of print. Though a deliberate
attempt to promote clarity, this does
sometimes give the impression that
the headline does not fit. As a similar
measure, the number of stories on the
front page has been reduced.
Other changes include the
introduction of a second section which
in contrast to the Times' equivalent is
not of a set format, having a daily
topic such as Review, Education and
Computing. While increasingly
cumbersome to read on the train, this
move may well serve to alleviate
those breakfast table squabbles for the
paper. The TV page finds a more
accessible location on the back page
of this section, though the sports
pages are still uniquely concealed in
the depths of the main section. While
the crossword is again given pride of
place on the back page.
Although the letters page reveals a
fairly mixed response, there would
seem to be a general feeling of
acceptance (provided those letters
printed can be considered to be a
representation of those received). By
introducing such varied changes there
is bound to be something to irritate
and impress everyone. And, finally
having the leader page at the back is
a real innovation!
