Domination
IC lst-4
Goldsmiths 1st—4
IC started well and began to dominate
the game. IC were unlucky not to
score twice early on in the game.
Simon Cole made a run to the edge
of the box, beating two or three
players, and then shot, the ball hit the
underside of the crossbar and bounced
out. The other chance was a
goalmouth scramble but the goalie
managed to smother the ball.
IC's first goal came when Nigel
Collier tried to put a pass through to
Adam Thomas, but a Goldsmith's
defender intercepted it and
inadvertently passed it back to Collier
who struck it with his left foot into
the back of the net. The second goal
came from new boy Pip Peel who ran
on to a long cross field pass from M
Bradley and put the ball wide of the
goalie to make it 2-0.
The lead was strengthened when N
Collier received the ball and skillfully
beat the defender but before shooting
he waited for the beaten defender to
recover and then beat him again. Still
not feeling ready to shoot he gave the
same defender yet another chance to
reprieve himself, but Collier turned
himself once more and mustered up
the confidence to shoot.
The second half did not have so
much to offer from IC's point of
view. Goldsmiths started to re-capture
some of their form which has put
them at the top of the league. It was
not long before the score was 3-2.
Goldsmiths were going from strength
to strength but IC hit back with a far
post leader from Collier. But
unfortunately this did not turn the
game around. With IC looking
increasingly more tired Goldsmiths
made the final score 4-4.
IC 3rd X I - 2
LSE 2nd X I - 1
This game saw IC 3rds needing a
result, both for their own league
ambitions and to help the 2nds who
were worried about second placed
LSE's challenge to their
championship hopes. The game began
in the worse possible way for IC,
playing into a strong wind they
conceded a goal from LSE's very first
attack. Most teams would have
believed that it wasn't going to be
their day, but the IC team gritted their
teeth and began to play their best
football of the season. Paul Olden and
Darren Bolland were superb in
midfield and IC really began to attack.
The equaliser came after twenty
minutes—a great ball out to the right
wing from Paul Olden saw Darren
Bolland cross perfectly to Chris
Morris who rifled home a powerful
left foot shot. IC carried on playing
well, but were downhearted to see
Mark Radley carried off ten minutes
before half-time after a nasty
challenge. With no sub IC were down
to 10 men and LSE fancied their
chances, even though IC hung on until
half-time with the scores level. The
second half started with the wind
against IC's backs and for the first
twenty minutes keeper Dave Martin
hardley had a touch as IC mounted
attack after attack. Eventually the
pressure had to pay, Paul Neville
worked the ball across the LSE box
to Neil Leonnard, who's first time
pass put Darren Bolland through and
a perfect finish put IC 2-1 up. IC
relaxed a bit after gaining the lead and
LSE mounted some pressure, Ivan
Parkin was superb (marking 2 men
most of the time due to Mark Radley's
injury), and Chris Budgen, Kevin
Graves and Mark Woodgate all
defended so well that LSE never
really caused any problems. The final
whistle gave IC the win they deserved
and an invaluable 2 points.
FENCING
Drowning
_sorrows
Saturday and Sunday saw the mens
epee championship and the fencing
club had a team entered as well as
individuals. Having decided to have
an early night and not drink on Friday
night, I did not manage to find form
on Saturday and went out in the mens
first round.
Sorrows were drowned in
preparation for the team event. We
had a four person team which lost
narrowly to the combined services
despite a good performance from our
recruit Richard Jarvin. We also lost
to the home team but managed to beat
the Polytechnic B team quite
convincingly. Part of this may have
been due to us using Grolsch bottles
for water and our opponents' giving
us very dubious looks before each
bout. Credit should go to Pete
Cripwell since he managed to keep an
off form team together well. We hope
to do better in our next outing in the
Birmingham International.
