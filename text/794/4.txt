The Great Education
Reform Bill (GERBill-geddit?)
GERBill is a huge piece of legislation
the Government have put forward for
consultation to be revised then passed
and implemented by 1990. It's aim is
a large scale reform and re-
organisation of the entire education
system in this country. It is being
opposed by the opposition parties, the
NUS, ULU, and Imperial College
Union Council on several grounds.
The Bill generally removes the
independence of the universities and
institutions and places control over
funding and policy into the hands of
central government and industry.
Whilst not specifically mentioning
student unions, there are grave
implications in the way universities
will be funded as to our survival.
The Bill abolishes the University
Grants Committee (UGC) which
presently distributes all funding to the
university sector, and replaces it with
a body consisting of half industrialists
and half academics called the
University Funding Council (UFC).
The Government will have the power
to appoint members of the UFC thus
making such positions political. The
UFC will only have the power to
advise the Secretary of State on
funding.
Polytechnics will be taken out of the
control of local education authorities
and placed under the UFC and central
government. Each department in the
universities will, each year, have to
submit a bid for the limited funds
available based on student numbers,
useful research done, and success rate
in the department.
The implications of this are
frightening. Universities will be
forced to push their 'best'
departments and courses forward in
the bid for funding. The role of
industry in the decision-making
process could lead to a neglect of the
arts and humanities and also the less
applied side of science and
mathematics. The bill takes away
nearly all the autonomy previously
enjoyed by the universities, placing
control over courses in the hands of
central government.
Student unions are not mentioned
anywhere in the entire document. It
is assumed that SU funding will be
placed by the colleges into their
central administration budget in the
bid for resources. Colleges are more
likely to cut spending on student
unions than their own administration.
After all, student unions produce no
useful research, no industry contracts,
and attract no foreign students.
The NUS are opposing this bill with
petitions, postcards, a one day strike
and a large rally in Hyde Park on
February 27. U L U have voted to
support this campaign so we are
invited to attend the rally under the
ULU banner (12 noon, assemble
Embankment). IC Union is planning
an independent action in conjunction
with the Association of University
Teachers (AUT) and will be
discussing this at an Extraordinary
General Meeting next Tuesday.

Basil who?
Well I guess you're all wondering
why there are loads of bright pink
posters all over the place, so I'm
going to tell you straight. On Friday
19th February we have a rather
spectacular line-up in the Lounge. At
9.15pm Loves Young Nightmare take
the stage, they are a new pop band
who just signed a mega deal with IRS
records. Then at 10.15pm John
Shuttleworth will be on stage, some
of you might remember his earlier
stage name of Jilted John ('Gordon
is a Moron' etc.). Finally at about
11pm we have the amazing Bass
Dance performing, they are an
excellent reggae band featuring Basil
Gabbidon, the ex-Steel Pulse lead
guitarist. All this will be interspersed
with a disco and drinks, so at £1 a
ticket (£1.50 on the door) you can't
go wrong. The doors open at 9pm and
please be prompt or you'll miss the
fun. See you there.
Free
holiday!
No joke.. .A week in Grenoble, with
a party every night.
'Eh! Where's the catch?'
Well there isn't one, except that of
the thousands of applications
expected, only two can go.
'What do they do in the daytime?'
Meet students from other countries,
look at industry and meet some of the
people who run the industries
individually.
'What—every day?'
Well, no. Wednesday is skiing and
Saturday is free for sports or
sightseeing...or recovering ready for
the all night party on Saturday
evening...about 2000 people will be
there!
The 1988 International Week is being
held at the INPG in Grenoble very
soon! All it will cost you is getting
to Paris and a bottle of Scotch to thank
your host; INPG will pay for
everything else!
If you are interested in representing
IC, contact Mark Taylor DoC2 as
soon as possible for more details. \
Letter from
St Mary's
On Saturday 13th February the
Medical School let its hair down for
the first ball of the calendar year. Run
by the Football Club and billed
inevitably as the Valentines Ball, the
event offering value for money.
A main element of any ball is the
live entertainment. This year the
clientel were spoilt for choice.
Opening the ball were Just 4 Kicks,
a Mary's band singing Smiths'
numbers and the like. With a good
following in the establishment, this
proved a popular group. Followed by
a burst of Psychotherapy in the form
of the Viva Beavers, the main band
were on stage by about half past
twelve.
Heavens Above are a rising band
with many London club gigs and a
strong following in the Medical
School. This stems from the fact that
their old bass player left the group to
commence a course in Medicine at
Mary's, thus a group of people have
been exposed to the band and its
popularity has spread.
Mr Ian Howgate and Chas Brereton
made guest appearances at the Ball.
Apparently, Chas had to be taxied
back to IC completely out of his skull.
A little bird tells me that on his four
visits here, each time he has been
incapacitated and had to be escorted
home. Ian had swapped his pink bow
tie for a pre-made black leather bow
tie which I suppose is an
improvement. They did seem to enjoy
the Ball which can only bode well for
the future, as the future must lie
through integration to remove all the
malicious rumours.
A wine bar with a large range of
wines and waiter service appeared at
this ball and was a most welcome
addition to the usual Pimms, cocktail
and standard bars. The disco was full
until 3.30am with revellers dancing
the night away, and by 4.30am the
final party-goers had left leaving the
mammoth task of clearing up all the
glasses, bottles and, not least,
removing all the decorations that
transform the building quite
magnificently.
