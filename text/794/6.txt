Scientists neither read enough books
nor write enough books; they will
have to start doing both if they want
British science to survive, in a healthy
state, into the next century.
Why write books?
Scientists need to write books
because, unless they do, people will
think that their time is spent simply
enjoying themselves at tax payers'
expense. Scientists can no longer
afford the luxury of assuming that the
value of their work is self-evident to
the general public. They have to
justify their existence; nobody else
will do it for them.
The public's interest in science is
difficult to measure, but appears to be
declining. Fewer people seem to want
to study sciences at school. Some
subjects are much worse than others.
Take Chemistry, for example. ICI
reckon they will run out of qualified
chemists some time in the nineties (if
present trends continue).
There are two or three interlocking
reasons for this. The supply of
properly qualified teachers is drying
up. This is exacerbated by a chronic
shortage of the money needed to fund
proper practical chemistry teaching
(chemistry is uniquely demanding of
experimental equipment). Also,
chemistry has a terribly bad image
problem with the general public.
Seveso, Bhopal and food additives
have done a lot of damage to the
industry's image. But it is ignorance
that is the biggest enemy. Call a food
additive Citric Acid or E321 and the
public will worry about its effects,
call it natural fruit extract (which is
what it is) and they will rush to buy
your product.
The situation would not be so bad
if chemists had explained their work
to the public. But they have rushed
headlong into not doing that, with
only one or two recent exceptions.
Compared with the screaming hordes
of books on particle physics and
astronomy, chemistry might as well
not exist as far as the general public
is concerned. Without some drastic
action chemistry will soon pay the
price.
It is strange that the most
economically useless sciences get the
most publicity. The chemical industry
6
is the most successful manufacturing
industry this country has (and it
achieved this without government
support through tariff barriers,
defence contracts or subsidies), but
university chemistry gets much less
money than either astronomy or
particle physics, neither of which add
anything to the nation's well being.
I am not saying that it is never right
to do expensive but useless research,
but such research is always a luxury.
The economy (whose taxes pay for
CERN and the Isaac Newton
telescope) needs trained chemists; but
it can do without astronomers (though
it would be a poorer country
intellectually if it didn't have any).
The point I am trying to make is
this: scientists have to tell people what
the point of their work is. They have
to publicise how exciting research is,
and what difference it makes to the
man in the street. Chemistry is just
one example of where this has not
been done, and the long term decline
of the subject is now starting to
become evident as a result. And that
is not the worse thing; many people
now make completely irrational
decisions about chemistry (eg the food
additives scare) that are based on
nothing more than a complete and
utter ignorance of the subject. It could
happen to your subject, too, unless
somebody starts doing something
about it.
Why read books?
How can you write books, if you
never read them? Many scientists
have a bad habit of not being
interested in books. This is probably
because of the way our school system
works. We encourage people to
specialise in either science or arts at
A-level, thereby doing our best to
stop any interest in literature or
language among our future scientists.
This tends to prevent them becoming
even adequately literate. This is a
significant barrier when they need to
tell other people about their work.
However, all is not lost. Those of
you who gave up reading because you
thought Charles Dickens was a boring
old fart when you were forced to read
his books for English Literature O-
level, have still got a whole world of
interesting modern fiction to discover.
But good books about the real world
are more fun. Unfortunately, most of
them are about that small portion of
the world dealt with by particle
physics, astronomy or David
Attenborough.
Nevertheless, they are good books
and they do demonstrate how best to
get your message across to the general
public. You have to use lots of pretty
pictures and you have to avoid tedious
basic theory and use simple easy-to-
visualise illustrations instead.
But scientists must keep up with
their reading for another important
reason: they need to know what is
going on in the world. The time has
long since passed when we could
afford to climb our ivory towers and
pursue programmes of research that
were of no earthly use to anyone.
Pure research has its place, but all
scientists have a social duty to keep
an eye out for practical applications
of their work. They must be aware of
where it might prove useful. And they
have to be able to justify to the public
all the money that the government
spends on them. If their work is
doomed to perpetual uselessness, then
why not spend the money on the
health service instead?
The future
A good science book (or article) is
witty, has brilliant pictures and deals
with the sort of things that everyone
can appreciate. There has been
probably only one book of such a
calibre in chemistry during the last
two decades. As a result of this,
nobody understands chemistry and
few want to be chemists.
The public have a right to know
what scientists are up to. Scientists
have a duty to tell them. Chemistry
is just one example of a subject whose
cause has not been argued; many
other subjects will also fall by the
wayside if no one cares to tell the
people how interesting they are.
Next week I'm going to review some
of the best popular science books as
a demonstration of what there isn't
enough of.
