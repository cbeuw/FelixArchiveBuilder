GRAFFITTI CLUB
More colour
Do you want an especially eye-
catching poster for your club's big
event? Would you like a special club
t-shirt? How about snazzier than
average membership cards? All this
will soon be available from Graffitti
Society.
Screen printing is the process of
using a squeegee to force ink through
a masked mesh to form a pattern onto
almost any surface; paper, card,
fabric, plaster (!). Hand-drawn or
photographic designs can be used.
Those of you who saw the
PICOCON posters will have seen
what screen printing can do for your
club's publicity. Soon we hope to be
able to offer t-shirt and sweatshirt
printing at very competitive rates.
Graffitti Soc is currently being re-
formed. We need members, and our
suggestion is that publicity officers of
clubs that want to use our facilities
should join. We can then train you up
(it takes just a couple of afternoons).
Membership will be £1-2; if you're
interested contact one of the
temporary committee:
Chairman: Ian Thomas, Civ Eng 1
Secretary: Nancy Reading,
Chemistry 1
Treasurer: Simon Bradshaw,
Elec Eng 2.
Join up now—and spread your
word!
PHOTOSOC
Competition
The primary aim of the Society is to
promote all aspects of photography
within the College and to help its
members to achieve their full potential
as photographers. One way of
achieving this has been to organise a
competition entitled 'Exploring
London' (running from Feb 12 to
April 25). In addition to a number of
prizes on offer it is intended that all
entries of sufficiently high standard
will form the basis of a prestigious
exhibition to be held towards the end
of the summer term. (Students and
staff are encouraged to enter).
Over the next few months we will
also be holding a series of workshops
ranging from how to develop and
print your own films, through to more
specialised subjects such as
photography in science, landscape
and architectural photography, etc.
Details of these activities can be
obtained at the next general meeting
(Feb 18, 6pm, Union Dining Hall).
Anyone unable to attend can contact
Phil Turner (int 7488) or Sophie
Jackson (int 4541).
Finally we would be indebted to
any of the photographic staff within
the College prepared to donate some
of their time, to give an informal
seminar/workship on one or more of
the specialities. Anyone who can
help, please ring one of the above
members.
METHSOC
I believe...
'Students have been brainwashed into
accepting evolution'. So says
Malcolm Bowden of the Creation
Science Movement, and the guest
speaker at MethSoc on Thursday
February 25.
Mr Bowden will be talking on "The
Evidence Against Evolution for
Genesis' and everyone will be most
welcome to the talk and discussion
afterwards.
The venue is the Union Concert
Hall and lunch will be provided for
50p, starting at 12.30pm.
FILMSOC
Platoon
IC Filmsoc presents Platoon on
Thursday 25th February. 7pm, Mech
Eng 220, 50p members, £1 non-

ALLIANCESQC
Why not?
Anyone interested in helping to form
a society to promote the newly
merged Social and Liberal
Democratic Party should contact
Andrew Waller (Physics 1).
JOBBER SQUAD
Volunteers?
After at least a year in hibernation
we're back! If anyone interested in
any form of voluntary work either as
part of our group or individually then
we could put you in touch with the
local volunteer bureau.
It need not be a regular
commitment as many of the jobs are
'one offs' taking up an afternoon. So
if you want to earn some brownie
points then please get in touch with
me as soon as possible.

Department of Computing (1st year)
We are now half-way through our
programme of weekend trips for this
term, having visited Snowdonia three
weeks ago and the Lakes last
weekend.
The North London Mountaineers
Hut in Capel Curig proved a very
comfortable base for the former. The
Saturday saw an onslaught on
Snowdon by four different groups—a
successful attempt on Great Gulley,
a not so successful attempt on Central
Trinity Gulley and two plods up the
Pyg track, one returning round half
of the Snowdon horseshoe. A superb
ice-axe braking practise session was
also enjoyed by two of the groups (ie
sliding down a snow gulley head first
backwards!). On Sunday die weather
and snow conditions were extremely
good, and views were actually
obtained from the top of Tryfan and
the Glyders.
Unfortunately conditions were not
as good for our Lakes weekend based
in Santon Bridge near Wasdale. Rain
and very high winds made sure
everyone got well and truly soaked
the first day, although despite the
weather, Great Gable was conquered
via Great Hell Gate. Conditions did
not look much better the following
day, so although a very keen few did
battle on the hills again, a visit to
Sellafield appealled more to the rest
of us.
Other events so far this term have
included an excellent talk on winter
mountaineering techniques and a wine
tasting session. Lots more is planned
up to the end of term (see our
noticeboard in Beit Arch) leading up
to the Easter Tour to Skye, which
should be very interesting.
