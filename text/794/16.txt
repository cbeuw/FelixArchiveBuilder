Record IC computer thefts
There has been a recent spate of
computer thefts throughout the
College. Since the third week of
January more than ten pieces of
computer equipment have
disappeared, most of the thefts
occuring in the Departments of
Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The latest was an Amstrad
computer and keyboard from
Chemical Engineering, which was
stolen sometime between 7.30pm and
10.15pm on Wednesday. The
computer is believed to be holding
about six months' of a student's
thesis, which is not stored elsewhere.
Terry Briley of College Security
said that this rate of theft is not usual
and appealed for anyone who has any
information to contact Security on int
Baker backs down
3370 during offices hours or 3372 out
of hours. He urged computer users to
'insist that stuff is clamped down' and
always to lock computer room doors
when the computers are unattended.
All but one of the computers were
carried out through doors which were
left unlocked.
The largest theft was worth about
£7500 and was carried out between
8pm and 9pm one evening last week
in Chemistry. When asked whether he
thought it likely that the equipment
would be recovered, Mr Briley was
not optimistic. The computers are
'highly marketable', he explained.
The Scenes of Crimes Officer has
inspected the relevant rooms but was
unable to find any identifiable marks.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the Government's
Education Secretary, has reiterated
that the Government would never
interfere in the detailed work of the
new Universities Funding Council
(UFC). This follows a demand made
by university vice-chancellors to the
standing Commons Committee which
is considering the Education Reform
Bill in detail. Originally Mr Baker
proposed that the UFC would have
control over money raised from non-
government sources. He has now
backed down, telling MPs that the
UFC would just control government
funding.
Mr Baker denied that sinister
government motives lay behind his
proposals. He wants the new UFC to
make its own decisions on allocation
of funds and advise him on the
funding needs of higher education,
but without acting as a lobby for more
money.
Many Vice Chancellors have
expressed their fear that the Great
Education Reform Bill could lead to
Government abuse of their new
powers. The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals (CVCP)
believe that ministers could demand
certain courses to be taught or not
taught at universities. Mr Baker said
that amendments would be tabled at
the report stage which would make
clear that the Secretary of State had
no powers to impose specific
conditions over flow of money.
The CVCP said later that they were
reassured by Mr Baker's statement
but would wait until they saw the
amendments.before they were willing
to make a judgement.
Herriot-Watt
sayNo
Herriot-Watt University students have
voted against reaffiliation to the
National Union of Students (NUS) by
more than 55% in a 53% poll. The
University voted by 53 % to leave the
NUS in 1981, when the student
association was dominated by the
Federation of Conservative Students,
however, it is now under the control
of independents.
Only three of Scotland's eight
universities are in the NUS.
Manager at
Easter now
The new Union Manager is to be
appointed to start at Easter following
a meeting of the Imperial College
Union Council at Silwood Park on
Monday.
The Union Manager is to be a
permanent member of the Union staff
and will oversee the running of the
Union Snack Bar, Bar, transport and,
possibly, Southside Shop when he/she
is appointed.
Wrist twist
Guild's President Dave Tyler broke
his wrist in a rugby match against
Birmingham. The game was played
at Teeside Polytechnic and the
competition involved Chemical
Engineering departments all around
the country. Dave Tyler was not the
only member of the team to suffer,
in the space of ten minutes one IC
player had his head cut open, and
another received a black eye. Mr
Tyler was taken to Middlesborough
General Hospital to have a cast put
on, which should be taken off in about
a week.
Pot plot
The Royal College of Science Union's
Three Handled Pot went missing from
the Union Bar over the weekend.
Several clubs were suspected but it
was returned on Wednesday
afternoon with a can of beans inside
it. No further action is to be taken.
Papers up
Papers went up at 9.30am on Monday
morning for the sabbatical posts.
Nigel D Baker (Chem Eng) and Paul
Shanley (Maths) have both been
nominated for President. The position
of Deputy President has so far
resulted in Steven Mercer (Physics)
and Charles Brereton (Biochem)
standing. So far only Ian Morris (Civ
Eng) has put himself forward for
Honorary Secretary. Three people so
far have signed up for FELIX Editor
Chris Martin (Computing), Bill
Goodwin (Mech Eng), Martyn Peck
(Chemistry).
Papers will remain up until 5.30pm
on Friday 26th February. By
Thursday lunchtime only Nigel D
Baker, Ian Morris and Chris Martin
had been fully proposed and
seconded.
ICR survey
Imperial College Radio is carrying
out a survey of Princes Gardens'
residents to find out if anybody is
taking advantage of their service.
They are keen to discover whether
they are playing the right sort of
music, if people can pick up their
signal well in their rooms and if
students would listen to IC Radio if
it were allowed to broadcast on F M .
