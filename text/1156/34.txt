Having been told that we didn't
have any opponents, the girls
boarded the coach eagerly to
head for their walkover. But
when we got to the pitch, we
found not only a full team but
one with plenty of subs. As
there were only 8 of us (since
Underdown had a rather too
good night at Scandies the
night before and was deemed
to ill to play, plus a few others
who missed the coach), Chun-
derbird kidnapped 3 football
players, Marie, Vasso and
Sarah whilst the team battled
on. Despite the fact that the
opponents had a full team and
we only had 8, we were storm-
ing and whilst the football girls
were having a quick lesson at
hockey on the sidelines , Katie
sneaked a crafty one past the
goalie and we were 1 - 0 up.
The football girls were at times
a little confused by the rules of
hockey, but they were great.
Half time came and went
quickly and we continued in
style. Patsy's classy goal swiftly
followed and we were on a roll.
George's had a shot at goal but
that was easily dismissed by our
fabulous goalie Louise. That
was the only attempt they had
on goal. After this slight shock,
the girls were back to work and
just before full time, Tinky-
Winky cunningly defected the
ball into the net making our vic-
tory complete. Just as well we
turned up, otherwise it would
have been a 6-0 defeat for us.
Once again we are grateful to
the football girls Marie, Vasso
and Sarah and we'll return the
favour soon.

LSE 1
The witches of LSE tried their best
to cast their spell on IC this
Halloween but failed. Ex-IC
striker Juliet was up to her
usual tricks, hacking our
defence down and LSE hadn't
changed a bit since we beat
them last year 1 -0.
IC went ahead after about
15 mins thanks to Marie's div-
ing header off a flicked on cor-
ner. From then on it was an
evenly matched game of offside
ping-pong mostly due to great
defensive tactical manoeuvres
from both sides. Jasmine slid
one away after a cross/shot
skidded across the goal face
and Juliet put one past our
stand in keeper Mel to leave it
2-1 to IC at full time.

QMW
QMW beat us 9-0 the previous
week, mainly because only 9 peo-
ple turned up for the match. This
week, with a full team and three
subs, we felt we were in with a
chance. The game was almost
evenly matched in the first half
hour. IC had a few chances but
lacked finishing touches. QMW
finally pierced through the IC
defence, but we were back in the
game with an excellent individual
effort from Becky. With the score
1 - 1 30 seconds from half time, we
still felt we were in with a chance to
get three points from the game, but
a lack of chances in the second
half didn't yield any more goals.
QMW were luckier, winning the
game with a shot going in off the
post from outside the area.

Our winning ways continue its now
3 out of 3. A period of intense
pressure straight from kick off led
to a penalty that Romy duly con-
verted. We were then straight back
at them again and after a long
period of pressure Romy crashed
through to score, and then convert-
ed her try. Despite excellent play by
their fly half, our forwards were
stunning and no. 8 Claire powered
through 5 players to score. An
excellent break by Clare allowed
Joe to score her 1 st try. Then Betsy
scored a runaway try to complete
the half. The good play continued
into the second half and we were
starting to look impressive. After
spending much of the half in
scrums. We ended up on their line
and Kate went over in the comer
for her debut try. The game finished
with another try from Betsy. Well
done to Jessamy Miriam and
Emma for their 1 st matches.
Rs. You're not supposed to
laugh at Kryzi's conversion attempt
when you were all too chicken to
try.

From the start, I.C. lsts controlled
the play. Slick passing throughout
the team left the defence a little
bored, so bored in fact that the
medics managed to take the lead
with their first, and last chance of
the half. Finishing proved to be a
slight problem for most of this
game with numerous chances
going begging. The score was
finally levelled just before half-time
when Marcos found out he could
kick again!
The second half followed the
same pattern as the first: loads of
chances, loads of misses. Nak
finally gave the 1 sts a well-earned
lead finishing from close range
after a slapstick goalmouth scram-
ble. The third came from Private
Waight, scoring with his head from
Steve's corner. The best goal of all
came next with Marcos scoring
again after a controlled build up,
to wrap up the game.
At the end of the day, a com-
fortable win for the lsts, and the
margin of victory could easily have
been more.
During the summer, three mem-
bers of the Imperial College
Union Rifle and Pistol club
entered the National Rifle Associ-
ation's 130th Imperial Meeting.
This event attracted over a thou-
sand competitors from all over
the world for two weeks of indi-
vidual team matches.
In the individual competitions
Philip Golds scored an excellent
49.7 (ex 50.10) in the 900 yard
Conan Doyle competition to fin-
ish 59th and was placed in the
Clementi Smith and Elkington
aggregates. Gareth Hillier shot
well in his first proper Bisley
meeting, being placed on five
prized lists including 14th in the
Admiral Hutton Tyro Trophy.
Andrew Eldridge made the top
fifty in six competitions, including
6th place in the final of the St
Georges Prize.
All three IC shooters shot for
University of London in the BUSA
team matches. Against opposi-
tion from Bath, Bristol, Cam-
bridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham,
Oxford, Reading and Southamp-
ton universities, London came
fourth in the musketeers (short
and middle distances), 2nd in the
university's long range and 1 st in
the universities aggregate match-
es. Andrew also shot for the win-
ning England team in the Univer-
sities National Match.
The social side of the meeting
proved equally enjoyable with
events such as the annual Univer-
sity of London Hog Roast, which
catered for over 120 people and
involved the cooking of a whole
lamb and a pig on the barbecue.
Phil and Gareth narrowly avoided
being put on the barbecue them-
selves, having arrived wearing
polo shirts bearing the legend
"Smallbore: for men who don't
need big guns"
Al! in all, the meeting proved
very successful for the shooters
representing IC. Our thanks to
ICU for their support of entry.
