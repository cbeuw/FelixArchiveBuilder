The Science
So, a r e w e really a l l d o o m e d ? W e l l , the w o r l d is
u n d o u b t e d l y getting hotter, with figures released by
the US G o v e r n m e n t s E n v i r o n m e n t a l Protection A g e n c y
showing that g l o b a l m e a n surface t e m p e r a t u r e h a s
increased by 0 . 5 - 0 . 6 ° C in the last h u n d r e d years, with
the ten hottest years in this p e r i o d falling in the eight-
ies a n d nineties a n d 1 9 9 8 officially d e c l a r e d the
warmest year o n r e c o r d . H o w e v e r , in g l o b a l terms the
picture is m u c h m o r e c o m p l e x : night-time lows a r e ris-
ing a b o u t twice as fast as day-time h i g h s ; similarly w i n -
ter temperatures a r e w a r m i n g fast whilst s u m m e r t e m -
peratures s e e m to s h o w little trend. M o r e o v e r , a large
section of l e a d i n g experts a r e u n c o n v i n c e d that the
atmosphere is w a r m i n g in c o n j u n c t i o n with the sur-
face, as satellite d a t a d o e s not s h o w a n y w a r m i n g
trends, a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y insist that we still have m u c h
to learn a b o u t the physics b e h i n d g l o b a l climate
change.
At the s a m e time, the s n o w c o v e r in the N o r t h e r n
Hemisphere a n d floating ice in the Arctic O c e a n have
decreased (as a n y s e a s o n e d skier will tell y o u ) , l e a d i n g
to a g l o b a l s e a level rise of b e t w e e n 1 0 c m a n d 2 5 c m
(depending o n w h i c h set o f research findings y o u
believe) o v e r the c o u r s e of the last century. A s i m i l a r
time-scale is a l s o b e l i e v e d to have seen a o n e percent
increase in g l o b a l precipitation (although rainfall pat-
terns w o u l d s e e m to h a v e b e c o m e a lot less pre-
dictable a l o n g the way).
So f a r so g o o d - it all s o u n d s suspiciously like the
figures I h e a r d at s c h o o l - but w h a t d o e s it all m e a n ?
Well, the latest predictions suggest that a v e r a g e g l o b -
al temperatures c o u l d rise 1-4°C by 2 1 0 0 (with m a j o r
regional variations). A s a result, soil moisture (ie a r e a s
of fertile soil) will d i m i n i s h whilst rainfall increases, a n d
sea level will rise anything u p t o t w o feet o n a g l o b a l
scale (local values a r e m u c h h a r d e r to quantify).
Thus, whilst the latest figures a r e s o m e w h a t less
dramatic t h a n those originally projected (don't expect
London to b e c o m e s u b m e r g e d o r the h o m e counties to
b e c o m e a desert in o u r lifetimes) the news certainly
isn't g o o d . W h i l s t t h e scientists a n d g e o g r a p h e r s w o u l d
certainly s e e m to h a v e b e e n guilty of a d e g r e e of
s c a r e m o n g e r i n g a n d over-statement a n d s i m p l i f i c a -
tion, the g e n e r a l thrust of the a r g u m e n t still holds true
- left u n c h e c k e d the G r e e n h o u s e Effect will have a
very serious i m p a c t o n the s h a p e of h u m a n civilisation.
So the q u e s t i o n r e m a i n s , w h y d o e s n o - o n e c a r e a n y
more?
The Solution
Once the W e s t e r n W o r l d finally c o t t o n e d o n t o the
fact that g l o b a l w a r m i n g w a s real (a feat that
took a n impressively l o n g time a n d a massive a m o u n t
of scientific e v i d e n c e to a c c o m p l i s h ) the m i s s i o n b e g a n
to pass the b u c k o n t o s o m e o n e else. T h e first task w a s
to explain that it wasn't actually the W e s t ' s p r o b l e m ,
and the nineties b e g a n with b l a m e b e i n g firmly shifted
onto ailing Russian p o w e r plants a n d fossil fuel b u r n -
ing Third W o r l d countries (who h a d usually built their
power stations with o u r m o n e y . . . ) . I n d e e d , o n e of the
most c o m i c a l e x a m p l e s of a c o m p l e t e lack of f o r e -
thought remains the A s w a n D a m project - over the
c o u r s e of it's thirty year (or so) life-span the rotting
vegetation left b e n e a t h the lake will release a b o u t as
m u c h c a r b o n d i o x i d e as b u r n i n g d o w n most of the
w o o d l a n d in Western E u r o p e .
However, whilst it's e a sier to shunt responsibility
o n t o s o m e o n e w h o can't afford to rectify the p r o b l e m ,
eventually a share in the b l a m e has to be t a k e n (after
all the Industrial Revolution w a s hardly the most e n v i -
ronmentally c o n s c i o u s p e r i o d in British history). Thus
the Rio S u m m i t in 1 9 9 2 w a s c a l l e d to bring the w o r l d ' s
leaders together to attempt to sort out this mess.
A l t h o u g h m a n y of those present used it as a blatant
opportunity to present their environmentally friendly
i m a g e , it d i d p r o d u c e a very important basis f o r further
c h a n g e in the s h a p e of the F r a m e w o r k C o n v e n t i o n o n
C l i m a t e C h a n g e ( F C C C ) . T h e signatories of the treaty
all p r o m i s e d to push f o r a n t h r o p o g e n i c ( h u m a n
induced) g r e e n h o u s e g a s emissions to reach "levels
that w o u l d prevent d a n g e r o u s a n t h r o p o g e n i c interfer-
e n c e with the climate system". T h e F C C C a l s o r e q u i r e d
that all signatories d e v e l o p a n d u p d a t e n a t i o n a l i n v e n -
tories of g r e e n h o u s e g a s emissions, so that further out-
put c o u l d b e closely m o n i t o r e d . This f r a m e w o r k has
since b e e n m o d i f i e d a n d further e n d o r s e d by c o n t i n -
u e d meetings such as the Kyoto S u m m i t in 1 9 9 7 . H o w -
ever, at the s a m e time research into c a r b o n d i o x i d e
sinks (ie m a j o r a r e a s of forest a n d vegetation w h i c h
s o a k up h u m a n b a s e d emissions) have created divi-
sions in the scientific c o m m u n i t y , with l e a d i n g figures
suggesting that the sheer v o l u m e of forestry in the U S
m e a n s that their g r e e n h o u s e g a s emissions c a n p r a c -
tically g o u n c h e c k e d - leaving the rest of the w o r l d t o
sort o u t the mess.
In total, therefore, whilst international leaders have
m a d e m a n y pretty s p e e c h e s o n the subject, there's a n
u n d e r s t a n d a b l e lack of desire to g o b a c k to their c o u n -
try a n d actually force factories to close a n d p r o d u c t i o n
m e t h o d s to alter. Whilst moves have b e g u n to b e m a d e
in s l o w i n g the e m i s s i o n of g r e e n h o u s e gasses, the total
p r o d u c t i o n rate has thus not altered substantially since
the late eighties.
The News
So w h a t a r e we left saying? That yes, this crisis is
real, a n d that yes, n o g o v e r n m e n t o n the planet has
so f a r d o n e anything substantial t o m a k e a difference.
A n d , O K , that yes, we certainly d o n ' t k n o w e n o u g h
a b o u t the m e c h a n i s m s of climate c h a n g e to fully
explain o r analyse w h a t ' s g o i n g o n - but nonetheless
w e ' r e certainly a w a r e that without s o m e significant
m o v e m e n t o n the behalf of the w o r l d ' s m a j o r powers,
w e ' r e g o i n g to b e u p a certain creek without a certain
instrument...
S o , to finally get b a c k to the original point, why
isn't any of this news any m o r e ? H a v i n g a c c e p t e d that
points t w o a n d three a r e only partly the c a u s e , we have
t o a c c e p t that, in a bizarre f o r m of c o m p a s s i o n f a t i g u e ,
we simply don't c a r e a n y m o r e . W e simply forget a b o u t
a p r o b l e m o n c e it's stared us in the face o n c e t o o
often, a n d , in a strange way, we eventually give up a n d
a c c e p t o u r fates simply b e c a u s e w e ' v e b e c o m e b o r e d
with the issue in h a n d . Until everything starts to g o
w r o n g - o r a r a n d o m scientist starts to spout off r a n -
d o m theories a b o u t a n a p p r o a c h i n g a r m a g e d d o n -
this is o n e story that will, quite happily, g o away.
