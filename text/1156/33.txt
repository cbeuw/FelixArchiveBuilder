Unfortunately Q M W p r o d u c e d
a very competitive t e a m this year
a n d m a n y o f o u r regular fencers
were hit by t h e d r e a d e d flu b u g .
The t e a m consisted of " L e g a l " C a p -

G r o v e a n d Ursula "Titi's" M a r c i n i o -
mi w h o f e n c e d a d m i r a b l y against a
t e a m o f regular international play-
ers (they're b l o o d y g o o d at f e n c i n g
tool). M a n y of the fights were close
providing excitement for the men's
t e a m , but alas victory was not ours
for the taking. Hopefully the ( c o m -

Kings next week.

ICSM Mountaineering Society
A
mountaineering venture out-
side Britain was long overdue
but it needed the incentive to
take o n the organising a n d sorting
out that such a n undertaking requires
- Caroline did a first class job.
O n the 19th of July w e w e a r
ready. G o t across the C h a n n e l with-
out throwing up but m a d e up for it o n
several roundabouts o n the w a y to
Switzerland. Eighteen hours after
leaving Wilson house, w e arrived at
o u r destination o n t h e c a m p s i t e
"Shoenblich" in Saas G r u n d .
If action was the key w o r d , there
was e n o u g h in the next three days to
satisfy the biggest of appetites, start-
ing off with a lesson o n how to a n d
how not to behave o n a glacier. Kevin
(Batman) o u r other guide took the
more experienced group, while Robin
(friend of Batman) took the rest. W e
practiced step cutting, front pointing,
moving u p a n d d o w n steep i c e ,
jumping across crevasses, burying ice
axes a n d the more awkward j o b of
locating them a g a i n . Crevasse rescu-
ing (as we had practiced in the Lake
District) was put to the test, only this
time in a more authentic setting. I still
remember vividly hearing agonising
cries for help as Kate rapidly disap-
peared d o w n a n icy crack, o u t of
view. O h , did we laugh!
W h e n the Sun a p p e a r e d we were
already well o n our way. " C l i m b slow-
ly, conserve energy, keep going but
don't stop" w a s the instruction from
the front. U p a n d u p digging o u r
c r a m p o n s into steep ice, put one foot
in front of the other, watch out for the
crevasses next to you, spike in, step
up - the ridge looks miles u p o n the
sky. After a n hour w e can still meas-
ure the distance behind us but look-
ing a h e a d it still feels as endless as
before. Black dots o n the white back-
g r o u n d show that there a r e other
people around but all that is audible
are thumps in the snow, occasional
click from a n ice axe a n d heavy
breathing - plenty of that.
C r o s s i n g frail l o o k i n g s n o w
bridges, passing sheets of ice with ici-
cles like giant lances dangling from its
side, scaling steep walls o r just follow
a narrow path that is steeply carved
into the mountainside laced with the
ice. W h a t a m I doing? Reason goes
out of the w i n d o w - best just accept
whatever comes your way - just put
o n e foot in front of the other. N o t
even time for photographs.
Four a n d a half hours after start-
ing off, both groups reached the top
at 4 , 0 2 7 metres, the highest point for
s o m e of us. S o m e sweated b l o o d to
get there, while others w o n d e r e d
what all the fuss w a s about. Yet all
agreed upon one thing, a n incredibly
g o o d feeling standing o n top o f the
world with breathtaking views all
a r o u n d us. The Sun is out in full force
a n d w e a r e at peace with o u r sur-
roundings. " H e a v e n " (even the heavy
breathing has seized a n d the only
sounds a r e a faint breeze a n d the
clicking of our cameras).
After a bite to eat, we were ready
to g o d o w n , this time o n the south
side to get to the "Almagellerhut", our
a b o d e f o r the following night. T h e
route is mixed snow, ice a n d rock a n d
we learnt to move down (in pairs) effi-
ciently with " n a t u r a l " protection,
weaving the rope between fixed boul-
ders to keep safety to the forefront
without sacrificing speed. O n l y o n the
harder sections o n e climbs while the
other belays in the conventional way.
All too s o o n w e reached the hut a n d
spent the rest of the afternoon partic-
ipating in local customs (drinking
schnapps while b a n g i n g o n a c o w
bell).
A big breakfast with extra help-
ings of coffee, bread, butter, cheese
a n d the jam put us o n the right frame
of mind for a day of rock climbing.
O u r route possesses everything any-
one could wish for. Steep walls, airy
traverses, s o m e tricky mantelshelves,
a slight overhang a n d as a bonus a
"Tyrolean traverse" (a rope set up
between two rocky spikes, some dis-
tance apart, where you clip yourself in
a n d pull h a n d over hand across the
void). That completed our three-day
course. Robin a n d Kevin were o n the
whole pretty satisfied with o u r per-
formances, wished us luck a n d stay
safe.
