As for the rest of my rant, I'd
like to pick up o n letter o n
the lack of drugs articles in
Felix that a p p e a r e d o n these

W e all k n o w that Ed's d o p e

Westtife
Westiife
(RCA)
N o w , there are many reasons to dislike Westiife: they describe themselves as
a 'Boy B a n d ' (a collective noun more abhorred than the Tory Party), they don't
write their own music, they can't play instruments a n d they wear those m a t c h -
ing puffer waistcoat things.
O f course, they've been hugely successful (another thing we hate in this
country), having recently perched quite happily at the top of the charts with
their third n u m b e r one single Flying Without Wings. A n d this their self-titled
debut a l b u m will, no doubt, take up residence at the same spot in the a l b u m
chart, as they relentlessly recruit the nation's youth into their fan base.
These five Irish blokes d o have an advantage over their 'Smash Hits' peers,
however,, inasmuch as they have been favourably touched by the hand of
Saint Ronan. A n d if you're going to be m a n a g e d by anyone then how about,
u m , o h yes, the lead singer of the b a n d w h o practically wrote the Boy B a n d
H a n d b o o k . Pretty g o o d start really, and it does avoid all those usual tabloid
headaches of headlines screaming about infighting a n d the despotic m a n -
agement versus a bunch of naive young scamps. They're Irish. They're all
nice guys.
O k , so it's easy to be cynical but I'm afraid I actually quite enjoyed Westiife.
Obviously, they're not breaking any musical frontiers but then are we expect-
ing them to? It begins with the debut a n d number one single Swear It Again.
This is a cute ballad that will have you tapping your foot by the end no mat-
ter how hard you resist.
With seventeen tracks a n d over an hour of music they are being ambitious -
even the most devoted will be waning by the end. There's a b a d choice of
cover version half way through in the form of the ultra naff Seasons in the
Sun (why?) a n d Extreme's More than Words. I'd be hard pushed to predict
another n u m b e r one but I would guess it would be from amongst the first
half, possibly M o m e n t s which stands out from s o m e of the other more
mediocre tracks.
This is not a brilliant a l b u m and what they d o is not original, but at least they
are doing it better than most. I need only to direct you to track two - also a
number one - If I Let You Go. This song is fantastic. O k a y , lyrically it's not
C h a u c e r but it has one of the most infectiously singalong choruses since /
Will Survive. This is true sing your heart out in front of the mirror, classic p o p .
It's fun. A n d what is p o p music for if not for that?

Ian Brown
Golden Greats
(Parlophone)
The years since the a c r i m o n i o u s and
undignified collapse of the Stone Roses
have seen the former b a n d members try
a n d fail to recreate past glories. John
Squire gave us the cynical, market-led dis-
aster that was the Seahorses. G a r y 'Mani'
Mountfield fell o n his feet a n d joined Pri-
mal Scream. Ian Brown's first a l b u m ,
Unfinished Monkey Business was a pas-
tiche of only half realised ideas and
unused Roses outtakes, d o m i n a t e d by his
bitterness towards Squire, a n d particularly
the guitarist's cocaine use.
In this context Golden Greats comes
across as a small, but not insignificant, tri-
u m p h . The inauspicious opener Getting
High is c o m p o u n d e d by the diabolical
electro-funk of current single Love Like A
Fountain. However from here o n in the
M o n k e y King finds his rhythm. 'Jingle jan-
gle, here's the jailer' snarls Brown on Free
My Way, as Her Majesty's prison sen/ice
feels the full force of his bile. Somewhat
unsurprisingly, given our hero's recent
detainment following an air rage incident,
f r e e d o m is a recurrent lyrical theme.
A l b u m highlight So Many Soldiers' master-
fully weaves a desolate, absorbing path.
Late in the day things start to get strange
with Dolphins Were Monkeys emerging
from portentous origins to reveal one of
the albums rare tunes. Finally we c o m e to
the stunning Sabasonicos, the languid and
fragile result of a collaboration between
Ian a n d s o m e South A m e r i c a n chums. A
fitting finale to a record which is intermit-
tently wonderful, but seldom less than
interesting a n d intense.
