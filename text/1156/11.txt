The State of the Union
Council
Tomorrow night, the sovereign
body of ICU will meet to discuss the
important and interesting stuff from
the last month. We'll also have a
star appearance from the ULU Pres-
ident Matt Butt who will be talking
on ULU services for ICU and
answering your questions. Council
is open to all members of ICU and
if you get bored half way through
you can wander down to the bar
and come back! Union Dining Hall,
6.30pm, Tuesday.
Meningitis
As most of you will know and pre-
sumably read in this issue, IC has
had a meningitis case in one of the
Halls. It's a very sad thing to hap-
pen and there will lots of people
who feel personally affected by
someone they know being seriously
ill. It's hard to miss the posters
telling you the symptoms but I
would like to reiterate that those of
you who have had the jab are only
protected against type C bacterial
meningitis, not type B (twice as
common) or viral (less serious, but
still nasty). For a while now, we will
By Tasha Newton, Imperial College Union President
all be feeling paranoid about hang-
overs, headaches and drunk
friends, but that is no bad thing.
Quick action is essential in menin-
gitis cases, having worked the
'other side' of A&E, I can promise
that nobody will criticise you for
bringing someone in who turns out
not to have meningitis.
Access Funds
For those of you who are feeling
broke, a little ray of sunlight. If you
have already taken out a loan for
this academic session then you are
eligible to apply for an Access loan.
but you must do it before 19th
November. There are some finer
rules and priorities, the details of
which are going up on posters or
you can email me, Kevin Butcher or
Martin, the Union Adviser (presi-
dent®^, dpew@ic or m.m.thom-
son@ic.) First and second years will
also need to apply for hardship
loans, but that's not a problem as
both funds just need a form filling in
initially. This is probably a good
time to remind the Freshers that you
need to apply for support from the
Student Loan Company, even if it's
for £0 now, if in the rest of your
academic career, you ever want to
apply again. It's not an easy deci-
sion to go into debt, but it's one
that the best part of 7,000 current
IC students have made!
