Gilles Peterson
INCredible Sound of
(INCredible)
In a series that has previously f e a -
tured the likes of Trevor N e l s o n a n d
Jo Whiley, the Incredible Sound of
Cities Peterson is the first of these
compilations that really deserves
the Incredible b a d g e . W h i l e M r
Peterson m a y c o m e from the s a m e
Radio 1 stable as M r N e l s o n a n d
M s Whiley, he is the only o n e of the
three whose sound has not been
diluted by the experience of work-
ing o n the biggest radio station
around
The operating level of Gilles Peter-
son is therefore quite different to his
colleagues. With more influences in
his sound than there are b o o k s in
the library, his sound is m a t c h e d by
no other. Indeed this c o m p i l a t i o n
provides the buyer with a n item that
is quite a rarity, as the a l b u m c a p -
tures the best of both Gilles Peter-
son's radio a n d club DJ sets. There's
all the funk, vibe a n d eclecticism
that you could imagine as the tunes
range from all-time classics to just-
off-the-press fresh flavas.
Giles Peterson is thus m a n a g i n g to
maintain his s o u n d a n d culture in a
minefield of blandness that brings
so m a n y d o w n . W h i l e the s o u n d of
his radio-and-label mates b e c o m e s
more a n d m o r e mainstream every
week, the s o u n d of G i l e s Peterson
goes from strength t o strength. Put
simply, the s o u n d of G i l e s Peterson
can be s u m m e d u p in o n e w o r d -
incredible.

Barry White
Staying Power
(BMG)
This a l b u m is the greatest piece of
shite ever to be played o n my stereo.
I d o n ' t even know why we bother
reviewing it. Barry White h a d his
moment. At s o m e point or other he
was in s o m e way at least a little bit
cool. Yes, he does have the most
increcibly d e e p a n d sensuous voice,
the voice of sex. O n this a l b u m
though, he just sounds old a n d per-
verted. H e a r i n g h i m say "baby"
makes m e think of a paedophile try-
ing to get his way with a child. Dis-
gusting.
The music is so incredibly minimalis-
tic you hardly notice it. The lyrics are
so diluted they m a k e noodle soup
sound poetic.
The a l b u m never takes off, it just
flows, forever churning out m o n o t o -
nous synthesised keyboard cack, o n
top of which Barry White rambles o n
about getting up, laying d o w n , a n d
all the other perverted activities
going o n in his old-man head.
D o n ' t bother with this, even if it
c o m e s free through your letterbox.

James & Ben say:
Sorry Disa, we can't agree. After lis-
tening to M r White's latest offering
extensively in the office w e ' d give it at
least a three. O k a y it's cheese, but
it's perfect for b a c k g r o u n d music
while we work. But w h o are we to
c o m m e n t ?

JoeStrummer
Rock Art and
the X-Ray style
(Mercury)
For those whose rock histories only
g o back as far as when Take That
split, Joe Strummer was frontman for
The C l a s h . London Calling, Rock
The C a s b a h a n d I Fought The Law
were chief a m o n g a succession of
classic tracks starting f r o m the
Q u e e n ' s Silver Jubilee year. This is
only his second solo effort in the thir-
teen years since The C l a s h d i s b a n d -
ed.
The a l b u m is generally mellow, with
reggae style guitar a n d a world
music feel to several of the tracks
such as Sandpaper Blues with its
African chanting. Strummer's voice
would at times still have difficulty giv-
ing B o b Dylan a run for his money
on tracks like The R o a d to Rock 'n'
Roll a n d Yalla Yalta. So don't be put
off singing a l o n g . Nitcomb is a laid-
back jam about the minutiae of city
life, optimism tempered with resigna-
tion: 'Love buys a six pack a n d gives
it to the bums'. H e started from the
Westway, so Willesden to Crickle-
wood, fhe melodious final track,
may be a c o m i n g h o m e song. N o
social climbing d o n e there then.
A n honest, a n d often uplifting
a l b u m . It deserves to get s o m e air-
time even o n A O R stations. Less c o n -
frontational than The C l a s h were,
fans will still want to buy it. If you
weren't into The C l a s h (or were too
young then), it's worth a punt now.
