Tunes f r o m this lot may
err towards the cheesey
e n d of the d a n c e music
s p e c t r u m , but it's easy
to f o r g i v e w h e n y o u
c o n s i d e r the way they
m a k e y o u w a n t to
d a n c e . There's s o m e
m a s t e r f u l mixes f r o m

Basement Jaxx
Jump and Shout
(XL Recordings)
B a s e m e n t Jaxx s e e m to have a way
with beats. J u m p a n d Shout kicks in
with a style that almost s o u n d s like a
b a d DJ crashing rhythms, but like
their other tunes a few m o r e listens
are e n o u g h to win you over. The lyri-
cal delivery c o m e s f r o m an A f r i c a n
t r i b e s m a n , a n d all in all this is Base-
ment Jaxx classic. Don't be surprised
if these lads feature highly in Felix's
e n d of year charts.

H o w the Primals d o it is
q u i t e b e y o n d m e .
S w a s t i k a Eyes is a n o t h -
er a b s o l u t e l y b a r n -
s t o r m i n g track. They've

the C h e m i c a l Brothers,
but the way they turn

Another Level
Bomb Diggy
(Arista)
Apparently the "theme
tune f r o m the T4 p r o -
g r a m m e N o r t h H o l l y -
w o o d H i g h " which the
c o v e r - m o u n t e d sticker
helpfully informs us c a n
be seen S u n d a y s o n
C h a n n e l 4. The b o y
b a n d with R 'n' B per-
s u a s i o n s p r o v i d e us
with a n o t h e r silky soul
tune. The title is rhymed
with a lot of silly p h r a s -
es s u c h as " g o o d y
g o o d y " a n d "chocolate
puddy". This s o n g is
neither.
Supergrass
Mary
(Pariophone)
Supergrass a l b u m s keep getting bet-
ter a n d better yet conversely their
sales get lower a n d lower. This is
o n e of their current album's w e a k e r
tracks but offers a contrast to previ-
ous releases, the breathtaking Mov-
ing a n d the fun but hardly innovative
Pumping On Your Stereo. M a r y
(where G a z sings a b o u t s h o c k i n g his
e p o n y m o u s girlfriend) still retains
e n o u g h quirky brilliance a n d c h a r m
to s o o n b e c o m e infectious.

Say You Love Me
(Mercury)
Slightly m o r e r e g u l a r t h a n the
O l y m p i c s , D i n a C a r r o l l turns up
every three years - but e a c h time
with only o n e decent s o n g . In 1 9 9 0
it was a cover of It's Too Late with
Q u a r t z . In 1 9 9 3 it was the w o n d e r -
ful Don't Be A Stranger. 1 9 9 6
b r o u g h t her a N o . 3 single with
E s c a p i n g . A n d this year it was that
s o n g out a c o u p l e of months a g o -
a n d not this o n e .
Dillinger
Cocaine In My Brain
(Mercury)
S o m e relaxed r a p p i n g
skips over this r a g g a
tune, filled to the brim
with the sort of funky
beats usually h e a r d o n
Sly Stone r e c o r d s . In
fact, the original ver-
sion of this s o n g was
a r o u n d in 1 9 7 6 . The
c h o r u s g o e s : "A knife, a
fork, a bottle a n d a
cork - that's the way we
spell N e w York." W e l l , it
is if you've got c o c a i n e
in your brain.
