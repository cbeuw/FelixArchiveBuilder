Cocktail of Chaos Major Mines Makeover
JAMES HOLIAN
The annual fresher's c h e m i c a l e n g i -
neering cocktail party w a s a night
most of the revellers w o u l d like to
forget. T h e C h e m i c a l Engineering
Society h a d p l a n n e d a lightly a l c o -
hol fuelled evening of N o v e m b e r 2 ,
fun for students a n d lecturers alike.
However, they d i d n o t expect the
night of tumult that e n s u e d .
The engineers, usually k n o w n
for their H e r c u l e a n c a p a c i t y f o r
alcohol, b e g a n d r o p p i n g like flies
suspiciously early in t h e evening.
The event s o o n b e c a m e a wild affair
with rows breaking out all over a n d
it was not long before college s e c u -
rity arrived o n the scene. Tuesday
evenings a r e not generally k n o w n
for their excitement a n d the required
security presence at the event pulled
college security t o full stretch. O n e
security officer c o m m e n t e d that d e d -
icated security staff s h o u l d b e
employed f o r these events in future.
The evenings mess r e a c h e d its

ing d e p a r t m e n t w a s f o u n d face
d o w n o n the concrete just off the
m a i n walkway. H a v i n g c o n s u m e d a
plentiful a m o u n t of a l c o h o l i c c o c k -
tails it w a s thought that the delin-
quent m a y b e suffering f r o m toxic
shock. A n a m b u l a n c e w a s duly
called a n d took the casualty to the
nearby C h e l s e a & Westminster h o s -
pital. It is u n d e r s t o o d that a n
overnight stay in t h e w a r d w a s
required with a drip to clea n out the
victims system, b u t a s t o m a c h
p u m p i n g p r o c e d u r e w a s n o t
required. S o m e victims o f the night
held those serving the drinks r e s p o n -
sible f o r plying the traditional mix-
tures with c o p i o u s v o d k a .
M e m b e r s of the C h e m i c a l Engi-
neering Society, the organisation
w h o o r g a n i s e d the event, declined
to c o m m e n t as Felix went t o press.
However, it is understood that n o
further action will b e taken against
any of the guilty parties.
