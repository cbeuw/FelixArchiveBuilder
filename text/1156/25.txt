Jesus Christ, what a dreadful play! Half a n hour into it a n d I w a s praying for
the crucifixion, just to e n d the whole terrible charade. The play was billed as a
controversial take o n the Jesus Christ Bible stop/ a n d was hot from the Edin-
burgh Festival Fringe. With that sort of hype, it was off to a b a d start... a n d it
got worse a n d worse. The story cast Jesus as a homosexual southern Baptist
preacher, the Disciples as his gay lovers a n d G o d as W o o d y Allen.
I should confess that I a m not religious a n d certainly not h o m o p h o b i c a n d
therefore went in suffering f r o m controversy fatigue. Sure, it might offend s o m e
right-wing vicars a n d those blue-rinse Surbiton wives w h o hold coffee-morn-
ings. Actually, the more vocal of G o d ' s people were protesting outside in the
street, guarded by a few fed-up police. They were singing G o s p e l songs a n d
telling us the error of o u r wicked ways. This was the most exciting event of the
evening, by far. I almost went over to thank them for it.
But what of the play? I must admit that there were a few amusing moments,
like the self-conscious tableau of the Last Supper. There was still t o o m u c h reli-
gious singing, though. A n d the 'controversy bits' when the m e n French kissed
weren't all that controversial. T h e plot structure w a s oh-so-confused. The play-
wright (Terrence McNally) h a d updated s o m e aspects of the story, with Jesus'
early life set circa 1 9 5 0 in C o r p u s Christi, Texas. (Why, you m a y well ask. I cer-
tainly did.) Then M c N a l l y must have got lazy a n d everything went back to the
usual setting in Israel with Pontius Pilotte a n d his chums. Slavishly following the
story without any trace of irony m a d e the whole thing seem like a N e w A g e
Christian conversion session.
M y G o d , c a n I think of anything g o o d to say about this play? I find it hard to
criticise the actors; in fact, I feel deeply sorry for them. They all worked hard
and were o n stage f o r the full two hours, which is no m e a n feat even for pro-
fessionals. They certainly d i d the best they could with the dire material given to
them. O h , a n d the crucifixion w a s quite grisly, a n d mercifully short. (I was
dreading the fact that they might d o the resurrection a n d drag the thing out
further.)
I can't think of any reason why anyone in the world (gay, straight, religious,
atheist) w o u l d ever g o to see this dreadfully boring play. G o d only knows why
the theatre was p a c k e d o n my visit. But maybe this b a d play is a g o o d sign of
the increasing equality between gay a n d straight: gay people c a n make
appalling plays, just like all us straight people have been d o i n g for millennial
reMix, Jon Courtenay Grim-
wood
reMix is the third b o o k from Jon Courtenay G r i m w o o d , whose previous cyber-
punk works neoAddix a n d Lucifer's D r a g o n , met with favourable reviews.
reMix is your standard cyber-punk blend of corporate e s p i o n a g e , sex, vio-
lence, technology, sex a n d more violence, with various intertwined narratives.
Taking place in what is essentially the William G i b s o n universe (complete with
the razor fingered Molly of N e u r o m a n c e r a n d M o n a Lisa Overdrive fame)
reMix m a n a g e s to g o o n e better than the established f o r m u l a . The b o o k has
a somewhat wider scope than s o m e of Gibson's b o o k s a n d certainly m a n -
ages to satisfy the requirements for violence a n d sexy A s i a n assassins.
The sub-plots themselves are t o o involved to summarise in any meaningful
way, but the books has a little bit for everyone, from the Christian cult in space
(very novel prayer techniques between the leader a n d his h a n d maidens) to
the steel eating virus sweeping across Europe a n d the Akira-type powers that
o n e character discovers that she possesses. A l t h o u g h not written with quite
Gibson's attention to atmospheric details, a n d somewhat less literary in its'
a p p r o a c h , reMix succeeds because of its blend of black-humour, stunning
technologies a n d sheer energy.
It rocks, enjoy.

The most successful b o o k by Brazilian a u t h o r Paulo C o e l h o , the

The m o r e cynical a m o n g the Imperial C o l l e g e student p o p u l a t i o n might
have s o m e t h i n g of a hard time with notions like, " W h e n y o u want s o m e -
thing, all the universe conspires in helping y o u a c h i e v e it." o r "...the prin-
ciple of favorability, beginner's luck. B e c a u s e life wants y o u to achieve
your destiny.", but taken o n a less analytical level, there m a y be s o m e
truth that y o u c a n take a w a y f r o m the b o o k .
Certainly this is a b o o k that I w o u l d r e c o m m e n d to all final year students
thinking a b o u t w h a t t o d o after g r a d u a t i o n , w h o might be t e m p t e d to for-
