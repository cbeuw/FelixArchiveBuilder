8 Interview Felix • 8 November 1999
2500 students. £120 million. Five campuses. One School of Medicine.
One Principle. So Chris Edwards, Principle of iCSM, what do you do?
How would you describe your job?
In o n e way o r another, the
M e d i c a l S c h o o l represents a r o u n d
half of the C o l l e g e ; it brings in 51 %
of the research i n c o m e , represents
a r o u n d 5 0 % of the C o l l e g e payroll
a n d has 2 5 % of the students.
In essence, my role is to fulfil
the M e d i c a l School's mission: to
b e c o m e a centre of international
research a n d to p r o v i d e world-class
t e a c h i n g . I'm a l s o responsible to the
G e n e r a l M e d i c a l C o u n c i l for the
quality of o u r c o u r s e s . . .when the
G M C p r o d u c e d their p a p e r c a l l e d
"Tomorrows Doctors" it precipitated
a major restructuring in m e d i c a l
t e a c h i n g . It r e c o m m e n d e d a
decrease in t e a c h i n g a stream of
facts a n d a n increase in self-learn-
ing. C o n s e q u e n t l y we've i n t r o d u c e d
a n e w course that is u n i q u e in the
U K in the w a y that the m o d u l a r BSc
elements are taught, which I think
will b e c o m e critical as the rele-
v a n c e of s c i e n c e t o m e d i c i n e
b e c o m e s increasingly important in
the 21 st Century.
How would you describe the merger?
We've d o n e w h a t you'd never
want to d o - m e r g e t w o u n d e r g r a d -
uate t e a c h i n g s c h o o l s , t w o post-
graduate s c h o o l s , several different
courses, a variety of c a m p u s e s a n d
a b r a n d n e w b u i l d i n g . Naturally, it's
a very stressful process, but my j o b
is to h o l d the w h o l e thing together
a n d s h o w everyone the a d v a n t a g e s
of the m e r g e r ; the b i g g e r picture
that we're all w o r k i n g t o w a r d s . C r i t -
ically, we n e e d to i n c o r p o r a t e the
ethos a n d traditions of all the o l d e r
schools a n d then build in o u r o w n
new ideas, a n d thus create s o m e -
thing that's greater than the s u m of
it's parts.
How does that effect teaching?
The structure of a typical o l d -
style L o n d o n m e d i c a l s c h o o l simply
wasn't c o m p a t i b l e with 2 1 s t C e n t u -
ry m e d i c a l t e a c h i n g . T h e situation
was a n a l o g o u s with N o a h ' s A r k ,
with the consultants g o i n g in two-
by-two, so that if o n e w a s absent
there w o u l d always be p r o p e r c o v e r
- which w a s a very g o o d system
w h e n there w a s less e m p h a s i s o n
research. N o w , however, there is a
n e e d to translate research into clin-
ical practice, which in turn requires
mergers to generate far greater crit-
ical masses, b e c a u s e world-class
r e s e a r c h n e e d s a n e n o r m o u s
b a s e . . . T h i s a l s o m e a n s that stu-
dents are b e i n g taught by p e o p l e
w h o are at the cutting e d g e of their
field a n d c a n thus excite a n d inform
as they t e a c h , p r o v i d i n g a m u c h
m o r e beneficial e n v i r o n m e n t for
o u r students. M o r e o v e r , the shift
f r o m b a s i n g t e a c h i n g entirely
a r o u n d learning by rote to a m u c h
m o r e practical a p p r o a c h m e a n s
that students are far m o r e likely to
r e m e m b e r what they've b e e n taught
a n d learn in a m o r e m e a n i n g f u l
way.
N o n e t h e l e s s , there's still a big
factual b a s e , a n d consequently the
G M C have f o r c e d us to identify o u r
c o r e c o u r s e s a n d focus o n t h e m -
which is a really t o u g h process,
b e c a u s e every professor o r lecturer
w o u l d like to think that what they
are t e a c h i n g is essential. However,
we've b e e n really ruthless a n d c o n -
sequently we've m a n a g e d to free u p
far m o r e time f o r practical l e a r n i n g .
We're always g o i n g to be faced
by the p r o b l e m of g e o g r a p h y . C o n -
sequently, we've set u p the interac-
tive v i d e o link system, which is just
c o m i n g o n line, which is a very
important part of o u r plans for the
future.
How important is research?
Unlike the other rest of Imperi-
a l , research in the M e d i c a l S c h o o l
doesn't m a p directly o n t o c o n v e n -
tional departments. C o n s e q u e n t l y
we've d e v e l o p e d a structure consist-
ing of a series of c o g n a t e research
g r o u p s w h i c h act h o r i z o n t a l l y
a c r o s s the vertical lines o f o u r
departments a n d divisions to inte-
grate research in a m e a n i n g f u l way.
T h e other critical e l e m e n t of
ensuring quality research is recruit-
ing a n d retaining the best p e o p l e .
S o , I s p e n d a lot of my time meet-
ing p e o p l e a n d trying t o sell t h e m
the vision. I'm a l s o w o r k i n g to build
bridges with other departments - it
w o u l d be idiotic to have a n isolated
M e d i c a l S c h o o l , c o m p l e t e l y s e p a -
rate f r o m the rest of the C o l l e g e , so
we have n u m e r o u s i n t e r d e p a r t m e n -
tal projects currently in o p e r a t i o n .
Indeed the first thing I d i d w h e n I
visited Imperial b a c k in 1 9 9 5 w a s
to set u p six audit g r o u p s to l o o k at
the work of the separate M e d i c a l
S c h o o l s , a n d o n e of these w a s d e s -
ignated to specifically l o o k at w h a t
m e d i c a l r e s e a r c h w a s a l r e a d y
g o i n g o n in the O l d C o l l e g e . . .
What's your relationship with the
National Health Service?
W e are critically d e p e n d e n t o n
the N H S for the delivery of o u r cur-
riculum a n d for access to patients
for clinical research. In return, the
N H S gains a great d e a l of expertise
a n d access to cutting-edge t e c h -
niques. The f o r m a t i o n of I C S M has
h a d a n extraordinary effect o n the
pattern a n d delivery of health c a r e
in L o n d o n , a n d we r e m a i n at the
forefront of this process as a l e a d -
ing partner in the West L o n d o n Part-
nership F o r u m (which consists of
I C S M , representatives f r o m N H S
West L o n d o n a n d the C h i e f E x e c u -
tives of all the local trusts).
The F o r u m helps to highlight
special a r e a s a n d bring services
together, l e a d i n g to the d e v e l o p -
ment of the Strategic O u t l i n e C a s e
(currently u n d e r c o n s i d e r a t i o n by
the Secretary of State) w h i c h s u g -
gests a series of m a j o r relocations
for o u r research divisions.
Will what you're doing here set an
example that other medical schools
will be following?
Aspects of what we're d o i n g are
certainly u n d e r very close scrutiny
f r o m other M e d i c a l S c h o o l s - there
is a great d e a l o f interest in o u r new
c o u r s e structure, a n d G K T are l o o k -
ing at the possibility of introducing
a A u d i o V i s u a l link-up system very
similar to o u r o w n . M o r e o v e r , the
C o u n c i l of H e a d s o f M e d i c a l
S c h o o l s (which I h a p p e n to be the
c h a i r o f at present) meets regularly
a n d provides a m e a n s to bring all
the s c h o o l s together.
In terms of student numbers, is big-
ger always better?
T h e results o f the Research
A s s e s s m e n t Exercise s e e m to show
that there is a m i n i m a l size (some-
thing in the r e g i o n of forty people
per group) b e n e a t h w h i c h research
s e e m s to suffer, s o size clearly is a n
a d v a n t a g e . O n the other h a n d ,
there is always the d a n g e r that stu-
dents will feel lost in a n a n o n y -
m o u s , a m o r p h o u s M e d i c a l S c h o o l ,
a n d s o we're l o o k i n g at ways of cre-
ating s m a l l e r g r o u p s within the stu-
dent b o d y w h i c h will ensure that
every individual feels noticed a n d
c a r e d for.
Finally, when will the merger
process finally be complete?
With s o m a n y courses currently
r u n n i n g , it's critical that w e move
the e n d s of all o u r current courses
t o w a r d s the style of o u r n e w course,
so that n o - o n e feels that they're
b e i n g sold yesterday's g o o d s .
Ultimately, mergers are never
c o m p l e t e . . . t h e r e will always be the
tension of l o c a l g e o g r a p h y . W h a t
we've d o n e is to a v o i d b a s i n g divi-
sions o r courses at individual sites,
so that g r o u p s meet u p o n a cross-
c a m p u s basis a n d p r o v i d e the glue
that h o l d s the system together.
N o n e t h e l e s s , they'll a l w a y s be
a l u m n i with their o w n visions of
their o l d m e d i c a l s c h o o l s - which is
fine, but w e must p e r s u a d e them
that their o l d traditions a n d ethos
have not b e e n lost, a n d will all be
i n c o r p o r a t e d into the n e w M e d i c a l
S c h o o l w h i c h we're b u i l d i n g .
