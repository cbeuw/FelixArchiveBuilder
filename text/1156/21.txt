Beth Orton @ Shepherds Bush Empire
.. sweet lips, sweeter songs...
After selling out her Friday night show, Beth O r t o n m a n a g e d to fill the
Empire for this extra night t o o ; p e o p l e have r e a d so m u c h a b o u t this 2 8
year-old that they are c u r i o u s to k n o w w h a t sort of a n artist c a n get both
of her a l b u m s o n the M e r c u r y prize shortlist a n d yet be twice o v e r l o o k e d
for the a w a r d . Non-lyrical insights into her character, however, were not
a b u n d a n t since she was not in a very conversive m o o d . Instead, she let
her singing d o the talking (if y o u see w h a t I mean) a n d impressed the
entire a u d i e n c e with her incredible voice. It is in a live context that singers
c a n really prove t h e m s e l v e s ; the m e d i o c r e c a n splice together the best stu-
d i o takes o n r e c o r d , but there is n o r o o m for error o n stage. O r t o n justi-
fied her enviable reputation d u r i n g her 1 V2 h o u r set last Saturday, which
included a new, a p p a r e n t l y untitled s o n g (although I'd h a z a r d a guess at
So Long) a n d a c o v e r version of The Ronette's / Wish I Never Saw The Sun-
shine.
For most of that time she r e m a i n e d unspectacularly rooted to the centre
of a sizeable stage in a d a p p l e d , pure white spotlight. She was joined by
an 8-piece b a n d (including a m a n d o l i n player a n d string section) w h o
filled out the s o u n d effectively a n d permitted her to ditch the guitar for a
few s o n g s , d u r i n g w h i c h time she s e e m e d to l o o s e n her u p a little. Lack
of energy afflicted the c r o w d t o o , a l t h o u g h this p r o b a b l y h a d less to d o
with the better-than-average support b a n d , D o v e s , than the a g e d e m o -
g r a p h i c of the a u d i e n c e (i.e. there were a lot of o l d fogies about).
Things c h a n g e d w h e n Beth r e v e a l e d that she was to be joined for a duet
by o n e of the c o l l a b o r a t o r s o n her Central Reservation a l b u m , Terry C o l -
lier, w h o h a d himself p l a y e d a c o u p l e of gigs at the Empire d u r i n g O c t o -
ber. Half the c r o w d was ecstatic; the other half were left a s k i n g their mates
w h o the hell he is. Visibly, Beth was o n e of those excited by his presence.
They p e r f o r m e d s o m e of his s o n g s , a n d the pair's voices w o r k e d well
together. It's just a s h a m e that the last s o n g of a l o n g e n c o r e was spoilt by
m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g s b e t w e e n t h e m a n d technical difficulties - it was a rare
slip. Clearly, the d a n c e a b l e beats f r o m the records were absent in this live
set, but this was n o great loss, it just m e a n t that n o b o d y c o u l d hide b e h i n d
expensive p r o d u c e r s . I shall refrain, however, f r o m saying that we were
treated to folk m u s i c , since 'folk' is o n e of those w o r d s (like 'country &
western' a n d 'Belgium') w h i c h just m a k e s m e turn off. That w o u l d be u n r e a -
s o n a b l e : Beth O r t o n deserves a g o o d listen.

Fear Factory @ Brixton Academy
.. heavy metal rocks!...
Say what you will about metal - "It's just a load of old noise... That bloke's just
shouting... They have silly shorts, etc" - but for sheer emotional impact, this
stuff works better than any O a s i s ballad or Italian o p e r a . Tonight's incredible
show was both draining a n d cathartic. First up: Will H a v e n .
It starts with feedback. The band c o m e on in suits a n d promptly explode, fol-
lowed quickly by the moshpit. The music simply shreds the air to pieces. The
b a n d sway, jerk and thrash about, caught in the maelstrom of noise they're
unleashing. With something this intense, this primal, you b e c o m e enveloped
and suffocated by it, until there's no option other than to scream a l o n g and
p u m p your fist in the air. The sense of fear a n d anger expressed onstage is ail-
too h u m a n . It ends with feedback. Totally inspirational.
Next: Fear Factory. For nine years, they've been honing their brand of industri-
al metal to a brutal art. The music seems so inhumanly precise, what with the
players stabbing out riffs like machines, a n d the machine-gun drummer. H o w -
ever, it's prevented from being a clinical exercise by frontman Burton. He d o e s -
n't play guitar, so he's free to connect with the audience, providing that h u m a n
link the music needs. His c r o o n e d choruses a n d rallying cries to jump higher
and sing louder make the vital difference.
A n d then G a r y N u m a n comes o n , a n d I'm suddenly reminded why Fear Fac-
tory are able to fill such a large venue to breaking point. Their cover of C a r s '
is very big stateside. Thematically, it's the correct song for them to d o , c o n -
cerned as it is with their favourite subjects of technology a n d machines, but
tonight it just sounds like the original played at twenty times the volume. O n e
glitch in an otherwise routinely excellent show. Face facts: Metal is great.
