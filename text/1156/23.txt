A gallery of vast tapestries, abstract w o o d e n
sculptures a n d paving slabs. Before experiencing
them in the flesh, you might be forgiven for think-
ing that these are just the hackneyed hallmarks
of a conceptual artist. If you still think this after
having seen this major retrospective of the artist
Alighiero e Boetti, I have doubts about your san-
ity.
While being mostly unknown in the U K , the dis-
tinctive style of Boetti has a cult following across
the Atlantic a n d over the C h a n n e l . H e started in
the mid-sixties with P o p Art (Ping Pong, Stiff
Upper Lip) before b e c o m i n g a leading force in
the Arte Povera movement, producing a few for-
givable duds (Scala, Tavelle) a l o n g the way. In
the late 6 0 s he renounced all this a n d started
afresh with a pared-down a n d more sophisticat-
ed conceptual style.
His interest in world affairs a n d extensive travels
prompted him to c o m m i s s i o n a series of giant
tapestries depicting the world m a p (Mappa),
updated every so often for political changes until
his premature death in 1 9 9 4 . In another vast
tapestry, Tutte (Everything), he presents a startling
chaotic weave of people a n d objects, reflecting
his other long-term interest in order a n d chaos.
By employing a n o n y m o u s volunteers to d o the
painting, sculpting o r tapestry weaving, he m a n -
aged to subvert the traditional role of the artist as
sole author of her o r his work. But is he also s u b -
verting o u r interpretation? After all, many of the
works a r e gently m o c k i n g , even silly (Senza
numero l-VI), as if to say 'I m e a n all this to be a
joke.' If it is a joke, it certainly is a g o o d o n e .
S p e n d Spend Spend, which has b e e n hailed as " T h e Best
N e w British M u s i c a l in Years" by s o m e critics, o p e n e d at the
Piccadilly Theatre a c o u p l e of weeks a g o . A s the house-
lights f a d e a n d the overture starts y o u feel a s t h o u g h y o u
are in f o r a treat. T h e orchestration is a happy m e d i u m
between p o p a n d jazz, the set is slick a n d y o u get the feel-
ing that the p r o d u c e r s certainly have Spent, Spent a n d
Spent b u c k e t l o a d s in putting the s h o w o n stage.
The s h o w is b a s e d o n t h e story of V i v N i c h o l s o n : the
w o m a n w h o went f r o m rags t o riches a n d then b a c k t o
rags, by virtue o f football p o o l s , g o i n g t h r o u g h five hus-
b a n d s a l o n g the way. In a similar vein t o shows such as
B l o o d Brothers, it m a k e s f o r a m o v i n g a n d worthy tale that
s h o u l d really work, especially in a West E n d m u s i c a l .

The characterisation is s o w e a k that w h e n V i v looses h e r

Higher Than Bab/e was directed a n d pro-
d u c e d by ex-IC engineers; Clive Pagent
a n d Tim Sawers, both of w h o were in
D r a m s o c .
Clive Swift - the husband from "Keeping
U p A p p e a r a n c e s " - w h o played Cardinal
a n d Matthaus, showed h o w g o o d actors
we see in general crap o n TV often are; a
superb performance.
The plot w a s a little jerky in its jump
between o n e time a n d a n o t h e r a n d
throughout the play there is n o edge-of-
the-seat stuff. It is not a n action play but a
thoughtful o n e dealing well with a complex
subject.
The central issue w a s the relationship
between society a n d science. T h e play
explores this by c o m p a r i n g a scientist
a h e a d of the field (in fifteenth century Italy)
persecuted for his " u n G o d like" ideas of
making a flying machine, with a G e r m a n
(in Nazi G e r m a n y ) w h o , dropping his orig-
inal moral objections, used his genius to
help work o n the nuclear b o m b .
Difficult issues were raised if a little obvi-
ously To what extent does society define
what individuals find acceptable in the sci-
entific world? For example I a m against
G M foods but if people were originally
against flying (a view I n o w find ridiculous)
does this not show that I a m just unwilling
to c h a n g e ? This play is a real springboard
for philosophical discussion, o n e for the
theatre lovers.
