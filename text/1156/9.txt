Where have
we been UNIX
all your life?
Just about everywhere.
Helping to develop all kinds of
life-changing technologies. From
the world's first comms satellite to
touch-tone phones, from high
definition TV to UNIX and C++.
And you still haven't heard of us?
Well that's not surprising, because
our work tends to occupy the
more rarefied and blue-sky areas
that are one step removed from
everyday life.
As we like to put it, we make the
things that make communications
work. By doing so, we've not only
broken new ground for the best
part of a century, but we've built

on the innovative strengths of
the world famous Bell Labs to
establish ourselves as a global
leader in telecoms.
Today, as Lucent Technologies,
we're one of the most successful
three year olds ever. A $30 billion
organisation that's poised to
define the next decade and,
perhaps, the next millennium.
If you're looking to be part of a
rollercoaster ride into the future
then come and visit us.
We'll be at your University
Careers Fair on Wednesday
17th November.
