McRON'S OPEN FOR BUSINESS
There is a need for decent names for the redevel-
o p e d areas that will result from the S C R project. -
" C o m m o n R o o m " is just so O x b r i d g e , a n d entirely
inappropriate for the wonderful spaces that a r e
about to be created. Kevin suggests ideas are e-
mailed to mishmash@ic.ac.uk a n d they will be
passed o n . Please be inventive, Kevin would rather
the areas be innominate, than find himself eating in
the " O x b u r g h L o u n g e " o r patronising " R o n a l d ' s " .
DISTANCE LEARNING SUCCESS?
Kevin has been hearing a plethora o f complaints
from medical students about the abject failure of
the School of M e d i c i n e ' s new distance teaching
video network. The team responsible has been
rewarded with the prestigious: "Rector's a w a r d for
excellence". The baloney excuse for this bizarre act
currently circulating I C S M has been that the a w a r d
was, not for the new network, but for a p r o m o t i o n -
al video production: "Training Tomorrow's D o c -
tors", which features the system. Kevin suggests that
if the fiasco is not over, a n d the system is not work-
ing perfectly, students should ensure their views are
heard at the presentation o n 2 5 November.
JOURNALISTS DESCEND
Why is C o l l e g e spending millions o n the Beit rede-
velopment? Better rooms for students a n d more
space for the U n i o n hardly seem like the sort of
causes likely to receive major funding from IC. The
s u m m e r of 2 0 0 0 sees Imperial hosting a one-off
event billed as a showcase of British science for the
Millennium. It is planned that Beit will house the
world's journalists, w h o will have use of the Union's
new ' m e d i a suite'. Kevin hopes that I C U ensures
this situation is fully exploited to o u r advantage.

LEAPING UP THE LEAGUE TABLE
The Rector, will be retiring from IC shortly after the
start of the next a c a d e m i c year. Beit, a n d the exhi-
bition are just examples of the many efforts that are
being m a d e to ensure that he leaves in a blaze of
glory. Kevin w o u l d not be at all surprised if efforts
are being m a d e t o ensure the current trend of
increasing the proportion of First a n d U p p e r Sec-
o n d Class degrees is accelerated. This c o u l d pro-
pel I C to the top spot in the league tables, the ulti-
mate high note o n which the Rector could leave.
This w o u l d obviously also b e g o o d for students,
perhaps giving e n c o u r a g e m e n t to some of those
w h o have b e c o m e disenchanted o n realising that if
they h a d attended almost any other university in the
country, they w o u l d earn a better classification of
degree. There never has been a convincing expla-
nation answer to the question: why when IC takes
in such well-qualified students does it have such a
relatively low proportion of Firsts being a w a r d e d ?
CONNECTIVITY.CONUNDRUM
The portacabins, which are presently the h o m e of
Felix are still not connected to the C o l l e g e network.
This is a ridiculous situation for the student newspa-
per at the MIT of Europe. Kevin recalls that when
The Estates Division o c c u p i e d the premises they
were connected to the Net. A cursory inspection by
Kevin's untrained eye reveals that the network
cabling was not disturbed when estates moved out.
The solution that Felix have b e e n waiting eight
weeks for can't be as simple as s o m e o n e from the
C C S flicking a switch, ould it?

P o i n t
For the vast majority of y o u , the next
big milestone will b e the advent of
the new Millennium at the e n d of next
year (a pint f o r anyone w h o c a n
prove it happens sooner). However, a
much bigger celestial event will b e
u p o n us even s o o n e r than that - o n
August 1, a new Rector will take the
helm of the great ship IC.
The incumbent, Professor Lord
O x b u r g h of Liverpool (yes, that's
right, Liverpool - c a l m d o w n , c a l m
down!), is d u e to pass o n . Before the
medics get excited at the prospect of
taking out their anger o n the remains
of the great I C S M architect, 1 m e a n of
course, passing o n to the ultimate o l d
folks h o m e , o u r noble H o u s e of
Lords. Keen political watchers will
know that while hereditary i n c u m -
bents of the H o u s e have only 7 5
words in which to justify their seats,
Sir Ron h a d the luxury of many more
(in the form of the Dearing Report) to
make himself Tony's favourite scien-
tific scouser, a n d guarantee his retire-
ment.
The C o l l e g e Senate has appoint-
e d a selection committee to find his
successor. O b v i o u s candidates f o r
the j o b include Lord Winston (the
noted T V presenter a n d fertility spe-
cialist, based at IC's Hammersmith
Hospital), Professor Susan G r e e n -
field, currently h e a d of the Royal Insti-
tution, a n d D r A r p a d Pusztai, recently
thrust into the public eye with his oh-
so-accurate research into G M foods.
G i v e n your £ 1 0 0 0 per a n n u m share
in Imperial C o l l e g e pic, Breakpoint
feels it right that you know w h o is in
the running, a n d has, at considerable
personal risk, broken into the Rec-
tor's Suite a n d discovered the follow-
ing shortlist.
Sir Alexander Fleming
Already canonised a s the n e w
"St. M a r y " by at least one-twenty-fifth
of the C o l l e g e , has a n impressive CV,
claiming to have discovered peni-
cillin, a n d already h a s a C o l l e g e
building n a m e d after h i m . Worrying
application form states will only take
up the job if his lab technician c a n
c o m e with him to d o all the work, s o
Fleming c a n take the credit.
Michael Portillo
Originally thought to b e more
interested in A l a n C l a r k ' s seat, Por-
tillo stepped out as a surprise c a n d i -
date when h e heard that IC h a d a
200ft tall Q u e e n ' s Tower.
Andy Heeps
Former President J a b b a the Gutt
was last seen marching round the
Sherfield Building quoting the U n i o n
Constitution at all w h o cross his path.
His C V states that he has " d o n e the
bloody job already". N o t favoured by
C o l l e g e Administration a s catering
budget limited. I C U ' s o w n M a r g a r e t
Thatcher (he just won't piss off a n d
annoy s o m e b o d y else), suffers from
delusions o f grandeur, a n d will prob-
ably resign at the first sign of trouble.
Anakin Skywalker
Born a long time a g o , in a galaxy
far, far away, this candidate has a
forceful application form, but worry-
ing early signs of a respiratory prob-
lem m a y be off-putting. N o t thought
to b e the Senate's first choice - yet.
Stated intention t o rebuild Imperial
forces a n d bring us A N e w H o p e .
C a n provide o w n black robes f o r
G r a d u a t i o n C e r e m o n i e s .
Breakpoint, however, has decided to
back the dark horse candidate, a M r
M Al-Fayed f r o m Knightsbridge,
because he is without doubt the best
m a n for the job. M u s t d a s h now,
have to g o a n d spend the contents of
my brown envelope at Harrods, a

experience.
