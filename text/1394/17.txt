Musical Theatre Weekly –
West Side Story
History
I
n 1949, Jerome Robbins (a fa-
mous director) went to Arthur
Laurents (a writer) with the
idea of a ballet/musical about
the gang warfare in East Side,
New York.
In fact, the original East Side Story
was a battle between Catholics and
Jews. This being post WWII the lo-
cation was moved to the West Side
and gangs became the Americans
and Puerto Ricans... yeah, cos that’s
less racist.
The idea became West Side Story.
Leonard Bernstein wrote the music
and a new kid on the block, Stephen
Sondheim, wrote the lyrics.
The show premiered in 1957 to
rave reviews despite the creators
being scared shitless as this type of
show had never been done before.
This is what makes it such a pivotal
show in the history of theatre.
West Side Story was almost an op-
eratic ballet: the first to put so much
dancing with music and to use the
dance to move the story along. It was
also one of the first musicals to deal
with a realistic storyline rather than
the usual “look at us, we’re all happy
as we’re singing and dancing”.
The first act ended with two dead
bodies and the second with another-
nothing was resolved at the end of
the play. The show went on to be a ma-
jor hit, having many revivals and being
shown all around the world.
A film was made in 1961 starring Ri-
chard Beymer (innit, I don’t know who
he is either) and Natalie Wood, whose
songs were actually sung by Marni Nix-
on, the woman behind the singing of
Deborah Kerr in “The King And I” and
Audrey Hepburn in “My Fair Lady”.
Plot
Generally if you know anything about
Romeo and Juliet you’ll get the plot. If
you don’t, what have you been doing
with your life? *Sigh of despair*
It’s about a guy and a girl who love
each other but their love can never be
as they are from rival gangs, so they
have to carry out their relationship in
secret.
When everyone starts to realise what
is happening they have to find a way of
stopping everyone from killing each
other, they’re obviously not very good
at that as Tybalt kills Mercutio and
then Romeo kills Tybalt in revenge.
Romeo then runs away to avoid get-
ting jailed for murder making Juliet
think he’s dead so she takes a sleep-
ing draft that makes her seem dead.
Romeo returns to find a dead Juliet and
kills himself, she wakes up to find him
dead and kills herself.
Unfortunatey this was a musical
in the 1950s so although the original
out of town tryout was faithful to the
Shakespeare story, but by the time it
came to Broadway Maria did not die
because those damn stiff upperlip
1950s Americans found death on stage
too upsetting.
Songs to look out for:
Tonight: Personally I prefer the end
of act one quartet version. Either that
or the Tony/Maria duet. Both are
amazing
Officer Krupke: Two words: Funny As.
America: I got to dance this in the
MTSoc tour last summer so I’m a bit
biased. . It’s still a very memorable
tune - who doesn’t know bababa
bababa ba ba ba….?
Main Characters:
Tony: The lovestruck Romeo character
and ex-leader of the Jets. He fancies
Maria.
Maria: The younger sister of Bernardo,
the leader of the Sharks, and she fan-
cies Tony. Anyone just worked out the
problem? Shit.
Riff (or Mercutio): Leader of the Jets
and Tony’s best friend.
Anita (or Shakespeare’s Nurse): Girl-
friend of Bernardo and confidante of
Maria.
Bernardo (or Tybalt) : Leader of the
Jets. He gets a bit moody if you touch
his sister.
Jets: The “pure Americans”, they think
they own the streets because they got
there first.
Sharks: The Puerto Rican newcomers,
who also think they own the streets
Where can I get it?
The DVD is still readily available, as
are many different recordings.
It is rumoured that a fiftieth an-
niversary production is in the
pipeline.
If you liked this, try:
Billy Elliot: This also utilises bal-
let within its storytelling and if you
know the movie then you’ll know
there’s a lot of male angst here too.
Romeo+Juliet: If you don’t think you
can stomach a full blown musical,
try Baz Luhrmann’s modernisation
of the classic tale. But I won’t be too
downhearted if you favour this over
the musicals, it’s well made and has a
kick-ass soundtrack!

T
he father of Romantic
poetry had nothing but
praise for Mathematics,
and could be said to be
very far removed from po-
etry. There is much novel punctuation
and line breaks which makes the poem
all the more mathematical thus mir-
roring the theme perfectly and mak-
ing an original contrast with literature.
Enough of the spiel, enjoy it my fellow
scientists. I give you Mr Samuel T. Take
it away Sam:
I
On a given finite Line
Which must no way incline;
To describe an equi--
--lateral Tri--
--A, N, G, L, E.
Now let A. B.
Be the given line
Which must no way incline;
The great Mathematician
Makes this Requisition,
That we describe an Equi--
--lateral Tri--
--angle on it:
Aid us, Reason--aid us, Wit!
II
From the centre A. at the distance
A. B.
Describe the circle B. C. D.
At the distance B. A. from B. the
centre
The round A. C. E. to describe
boldly venture.
(Third Postulate see.)
And from the point C.
In which the circles make a
pother
Cutting and slashing one
another,
Bid the straight lines a journeying
go,
C. A., C. B. those lines will show.
To the points, which by A. B. are
reckon’d,
And postulate the second
For Authority ye know.
A. B. C.
Triumphant shall be
An Equilateral Triangle,
Not Peter Pindar carp, not Zoilus
can wrangle.
III
Because the point A. is the
centre
Of the circular B. C. D.
And because the point B. is the
centre
Of the circular A. C. E.
A. C. to A. B. and B. C. to B. A.
Harmoniously equal for ever
must stay;
Then C. A. and B. C.
Both extend the kind hand
To the basis, A. B.
Unambitiously join’d in Equality’s
Band.
But to the same powers, when
two powers are equal,
My mind forbodes the sequel;
My mind does some celestial im-
pulse teach,
And equalises each to each.
Thus C. A. with B. C. strikes the
same sure alliance,
That C. A. and B. C. had with A.
B. before;
And in mutual affiance,
None attempting to soar
Above another,
The unanimous three
C. A. and B. C. and A. B.
All are equal, each to his brother,
Preserving the balance of power
so true:
Ah! the like would the proud Au-
tocratorix do!
At taxes impending not Britain
would tremble,
Nor Prussia struggle her fear to
dissemble;
Nor the Mah’met-sprung Wight,
The great Mussulman
Would stain his Divan
With Urine the soft-flowing
daughter of Fright.

But rein your stallion in, too dar-
ing Nine!
Should Empires bloat the scien-
tific line?
