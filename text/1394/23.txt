once removed from himself.
Andy was representative of a gen-
eration, using fashion as one of their
means, to create a public image, their
own persona. It inspires a fashion phi-
losophy embracing the superficial yet
rejecting nihilism. In taking the mean-
ing away from fashion you can either
be shackled by image, or free to create
what you wish.

The Superficial Superstar
A
ndy Warhol reflected the
consumerist, celebrity
nature of modern society.
Some argued that his art
was all surface, easily rec-
ognisable images that were essentially
meaningless. I believe Andy Warhol
delighted in taking the superficial, and
showing that while it’s meaningless in
itself, it has personal meaning as an el-
ement of popular culture.
In a way, the 20th century was a crys-
tallisation of the increasing individual-
ism of society. In the past people lived
and worked together and the group
meant more than the individual. Now
people live in wider communities and
more autonomously and individual-
ised. Mass production and mass media
increasingly tie society together. This
new mass age also allows you to create
and proliferate images and ideas. It’s an
environment that makes it possible to
construct a public persona, it gives a
means to propagating your image.
Warhol’s celebrity paintings weren’t
about the person behind the star they
were entirely about the surface. For
all we really know about celebrities is
the persona they project to the media.
They are people turned into a brand
for public consumption. It’s the myth
that launches them to stardom, with-
out it they’re just any other person.
As a child, Warhol fell in love with ce-
lebrity, the world of films and stars. He
was a veritable movie junkie, collecting
the free publicity stills in a box. It was
early on in his life he began construct-
ing a persona about himself, picking up
affectations from film stars, emulating
his idols’ gestures and personal tics.
Warhol found his persona useful in
career, it gave him notoriety but also
anonymity. When starting out as a
commercial artist he took to wearing
the same khaki trousers and beat up
t-shirt everyday. Even when he started
making enough money to dress well,
he’d put on his ‘Raggedy Andy cos-
tume’ when going out to meet clients.
He found they liked the idea of hiring a
poor starving artist.
He also, of course, famously wore a
white wig, drawing a veil over his real
age. He took pains to appear as blank as
possible, to not give any part of himself
away. In public he talked monosyllabi-
cally, using simply yes, no and ‘I hadn’t
really thought about it’. He peppered
his speech with ums and uhs, manag-
ing to talk without saying much at all.
Any criticisms of his art he publicly
agreed with, giving nothing of his true
feelings away. As Warhol once said,
it’s fascinating when a person puts up
a blank front, “because you absolutely
[can’t] tell if [he’s] a genius or a retard”.
Like Kate Moss (prior to breaking
her public silence) below the surface
he seemed to be a void. People could
interpret him as they wanted. He re-
mained meaningless so that people
could only guess about the man behind
the mask. He seemed to put everything
a step away from himself. Even the way
he painted, using silk screening, was
Andy Warhol, the superficial surface of the enigmatic Andy Warhola by Sarah Skeete

Neat Hair
I think we’re all getting
fairly tired of the drug-addled
scoundrel look Pete Doherty
has epitomised for years.
Boys, get out the hair pomade
and thin-toothed combs, we’re
all going to look like we did on
our first day of school!
Vans Shoes
Vans success in the footwear
market means there’s finally
some sort of Indie-cult rival
to Chuck Taylors. The now
ever-familiar slip-on style
is being mimicked by other
brands. Does anyone else find
them really impractical in the
winter? I think I’ve got frostbite
on my little toes, and due to
their absolute intolerance to
even the smallest amount of
liquid, never mind rainfall, you
constantly have stupidly cold
and wet feet?
Online Sales
What is the point in online
sales? The initial shock of see-
ing that coat you’ve admired,
for like, oh my Gawwwwd
soooo long, at a fraction of its
price is always counteracted
by the fact the only available
sizes are XXXL. If I was look-
ing for something to keep my
pet whale warm in, I’d buy it.
Alas, unless you’re one of the
sad people on this planet that
sit at their computers click-
ing ‘refresh’ at 6AM when the
website’s sale starts, you’re
never going to get anything.
What tops it all off is the fact
the coat you’ve been drooling
over is now out of season, and
has been taken off the web-
site. Bastards.
