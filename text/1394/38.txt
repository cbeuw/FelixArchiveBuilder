In today’s society many people con-
sider bigger to be better and this is
true of the vast majority of gym users
(predominantly the guys) who exercise
merely to get bigger muscles. These
people can be seen in the gym day af-
ter day pushing out rep after rep in the
search for bulging biceps, perfect pecs,
and amazing abs. Sadly all this time
and hard work often fails them in their
quest to look good as they forget about
the importance nutrition plays in the
grand scheme of things.
Being big is not just about pumping
iron; you need to have the building
blocks available to enlarge the mus-
cle mass that you already have. Dan
Benardot, author of Nutrition for Se-
rious Athletes, puts it nicely when he
says “the nutritional key to building
muscle mass is to consume enough
energy to support the larger mass.” In
other words, if you are 80kg and want
to move up to 85kg you need to eat
as if you are 85kg. As you lift weights
you break your muscle fibres down, so
if you only eat enough food for your
80kg frame all you will do is rebuild
what you have broken down and not
increase in size.
It is recommended that you con-
sume 1.5g of protein per kilogram of
body weight per day if you are looking
to increase muscle mass. Many gym
users will take in much more protein
than this in their daily diets and unfor-
tunately more protein does not mean
more muscle. Any excess protein in-
take will either be used as energy or
worse, stored as fat. Most of the extra
food that you need to consume to in-
crease in size is for the energy needed
to support this increase. This means
that your calorie intake needs to be
higher and it is better if you increase
calories through carbohydrates than
by the extra protein that you consume.
As mentioned in my previous article
on carbohydrates it is recommended
that you consume about 65% of your
daily calories from carbohydrates.
Along with adequate protein and
calorie intake, the variables of your
gym programme also play a big part
in increased muscle mass. Research
shows that training within a range of
8-12 repetitions over 3-4 sets with a
rest period of one minute will opti-
mally increase muscle mass. It is also
suggested to perform 2-3 exercises per
muscle group to encourage muscle tis-
sue break down.
The final component to increased
muscle mass is of course plenty of rest.
It is during our periods of rest that the
body rebuilds itself. Aim to allow at
least 48 hours rest between exercising
the same muscle groups and try to be

in bed by 10.30pm at the latest each
night. The body’s optimal time to re-
pair itself physically is between 1-3am
and to do this effectively you need to
be in a deep sleep which takes around
2 ½ to 3 hours to achieve.
It is therefore advisable to avoid hav-
ing a heavy workout prior to a big night
out in the Student Union as you will

from your workout and develop a love-

defence. Dmitry Pestov made a
string of impressive saves to main-
tain a level score. Unphased by the
score, Imperial regrouped and com-
pletely shut out UCL’s attack, the
home team were clearly rattled and
had no answer to IC’s aggressive
tactics. With the score at 4-2 at half
time Imperial were in the driving
seat, putting the opposition under
considerable pressure.
The second half saw IC run away,
scoring nearly a goal a minute. The
defence was faultless leading to a
series of break away goals, with
Imperial’s superior fitness clearly
showing. The final score was 10-3,
an impressive score from a game of
only two periods. With another vic-
tory under their belts the team will
go into the next game on Sunday
expecting nothing less than a win,
holding high hopes of further BUSA
success.

Do you want to be the man in the mirror or the one looking at it?
As our strongest London rivals the
UCL men’s team presented the first
true challenge in the BUSA tourna-
ment so far. After a string of close
previous meetings the men’s water
polo team had a score to settle and
wanted to make an impact in their
debut season.
Imperial showed their intentions
from the start with Jack Ellis open-
ing the scoring from the first attack.
However, a string of errors resulted
in UCL taking the lead within three
minutes, showing holes in the team’s
