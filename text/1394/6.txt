ALISTAIR
COTT
DEPUTY
PRESIDENT
(CLUBS
&
SOCIETIES)
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed most this year?
How varied everyday is. Being able to
solve people’s problems.
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed least this year?
N/A
Which qualities would you say
are needed to carry out your job?
Willing to give up all your time, need
to lead and project manage yourself,
be a fountain of knowledge, and work
hard on extra projects you need to go
and find yourself.
How was being a Sabbatical dif-
ferent to what you expected?
The amount of varied occurrences that
I have to deal with.
How would you like students to
remember your term?
Helpful, making club officers lives
easier.
Do you think you’ve achieved
your aims this year? If so, what
were they?
Yes, the starting of a more up-to-date
finance system and sorting out the
space in Beit before phase II.
What has been the most
important thing you
have achieved
so far?
At the start of my year club of-
ficers had many complaints
about the finance sys-
tem for clubs, by the
end I hope to have
solved all those
complaints.
If there was
one thing
you could
change
instantly
about how
the Union
is run, what
would it be?
Try and make it
less imposing to
students who re-
quire its services.
How do you see the
Union developing over
the next few years?
Getting more efficient in looking after
clubs, welfare and the trading aspects.
Do you think there is a problem
with low turnout in the Union?
Yes, students do not see how electing
someone will help them.
If you are not leaving Imperial
at the end of this year, will you
be involved with the Union next
year?
Leaving, graduated.
Do you honestly think Sabbaticals
make a difference at all?
Yes, if they remember they are there for
the student aims and not their own.
Do you feel an urge to get into
mainstream politics?
No
TOM
ROBERTS
FELIX
EDITOR
How was being a Sabbatical dif-
ferent to what you expected?
The main thing I was unaware of be-
fore beginning the job was quite how
much involvement I would have with
the financing of Felix. I anticipated that
it would take care of itself but in real-
ity invoice issuing and chasing takes
up a considerable amount of time. In
fact, probably the most significant dif-
ference is the amount of time I don’t
have. I believed my manifesto was real-
istic when I wrote it this time last year
but maintaining the website along with
everything else whilst retaining my
sanity (or what’s left of it) has turned
out to be too tall an order.
Do you think you’ve achieved
your aims with Felix this year? If
so, what were they?
Yes. I aimed to strike a balance be-
tween the styles adopted by the two
previous editors whilst improving the
newspaper on the whole and I believe
I’ve achieved that. I wanted to bring
back some of the more light-hearted
content from Rupert Neate’s term two
years ago and to combine it with the
less sensational and more professional
news style of Andy Sykes’ newspaper.
What has been the most impor-
tant thing you have achieved so
far?
I’ve turned the finances from a roughly
£4k debt to a projected profit of £5k
and counting. This is despite budget-
ing for three issues of I,Science and
two issues of Phoenix, as well as the
weekly Felices. In case anyone anyone
was counting, every single issue of Fe-
lix this year has been longer than 36
pages – the largest page count we’ve
achieved in the previous two years. I’m
also pretty pleased with the number
of contributors we have onboard now
too; Freshers’ Fair was really successful
in October and Felix should stand in
good stead for the years to come with
the crop of young talented writers we
have. My head isn’t going to fit out of
the office door now is it?
If there was one thing you could
change instantly about Felix,
what would it be?
I would call it “Tomo” and re-
place the cat logo with a pic-
ture of myself. No, I jest.
I would call it Live! and
write credible journal-
ism. Ha. Er, ok, I’d
love to change the
backend of the web-
site so that uploading
articles didn’t take
forever, that way
we could finally
get round to go-
ing through the old
issues of Felix and
build up an archive everyone
can look through.
How do you feel Felix makes a
difference at Imperial?
Felix informs, entertains, provides a
mouthpiece for students at Imperial
and holds people in positions of re-
sponsibility to account. If students or
staff feel they’ve been treated unfairly
of if they want to make their point
known we can be their voice. Felix en-
courages debate and democracy, and
I hope students think the review sec-
tions are a bloody good read too. Most
importantly though, I think Felix brings
a sense of community to the College;
without it, campus would definitely be
a drearier place.
Were there any distinct low or
high points as Editor?
“Distinct low point” is a bit dramatic,
but the Wednesday all-nighters are
a real drain. I knew what I was get-
ting myself into but it doesn’t stop the
bleeding sensation in my eyes every
Thursday afternoon after a 30+ hour
shift.
Invoicing and dealing with the fi-
nances is an annoyance almost on a
par with pushing the rick-
ety, smelly Union trolley
around on Fridays to
deliver the newspaper.
However, the latter is
also one of the high
points of being editor.
The warm feeling
that occurs in my
tummy when
someone yelps
“Friday! Felix!
Woohoo!”
and snatches
a copy of the
latest issue is
very, er, heart-
warming. Or some-
thing equally profound.
What is the best
part of being
Editor?
The hookers and blow,
definitely. The back
room is literally caked in
white dust waiting for me to literally
nosedive into once I finish this inter-
view. Literally.
Right: one of the best parts is seeing
each glorious issue in print on a Friday
morning. Each issue is a challenge in
itself: finding news, investigating sto-
ries, following leads, all in time for the
Thursday deadline.
The other main reward is working
with your friends everyday. The Felix
staff are eager, likeminded people and
it’s my job to give them an opportu-
nity to flex their literary muscles. I love
them and want at least three babies
with each of them.
What is the most tedious part of
being Editor?
I highlighted a few issues before, but
one that really grinds my gears is the
constant games the Felix network en-
joys playing with me. Just hours ago
before I scribed these words the entire
issue almost got deleted by my Science
editor because of a network quirk. That
was a seriously uncool moment.
If you are not leaving Imperial at
the end of this year, will you be
involved with Felix next year?
I’ve grown rather attached to Felix over
the years so I’ll definitely be returning
next year. I’ve spent most of the last
year and a half designing and editing
the newspaper rather than writing as
much as I’d like to, so next year I’m
planning to write more.
Do you see a career in journalism
ahead of you?
Yeah, I would like to go into journal-
ism. I haven’t pinned down which area
yet but I’m thinking along the lines of
science, technology or games journal-
ism. Anything to save myself from be-
ing sucked into the corporate banking
conduit which claims so many of Im-
perial’s best and brightest.
Are you Angry Geek?
At this moment in time, whilst I write
this at 2:26am, I might be. If you ask
me tomorrow, I might not be. It de-
pends on which day of the week you
ask me this question, which way the
wind is blowing, which way the world
is spinning and which way the water in
your toilet bowl is draining.
Can you tell us who is Angry
Geek?
Never. If I divulge this information,
the Angry Geek will kill me/I will kill
myself.
