wanderers style. Chris, Nath-
aniel and I felt bad about not
eating cake and so did – end
of story. Hijacking the juke-
box was fun until Martin put
on Ronan Keating (Martin
is German and so entitled to
bad taste).
The Sunday, which was cold,
wet and very windy, saw eve-
ryone wake up to Now 65 and
Gareth wake up to a hangover.
Amid fears that the possessed
snowman of yesterday would
follow us (he became radioac-
tive and is alive, as if you need-
ed reminding) we cleaned up
the hall and, like true outdoor
enthusiasts, sat in the café in
the village for an hour before
finally heading off for the Sun-
day walk. Most of the group
set off in the mini-bus for Al-
ston for what was meant to be
a short walk along the river
but my initial aversion to do-
ing a ‘flat’ walk the night be-
fore had led to the decision to
be dropped off several miles
from Alston and to do a long
ridge walk. Chris and Nath-
aniel joined me as we left the
bus and again walked up into
the cloud. The first words out
of Chris’ mouth were “oh bug-
ger, I forgot to the leave the 1
kilo rock in the bus” – he is a
geologist and so collects these
things.
Nevertheless our walk was
good, navigation through the
featureless bog-cloud scenery
made easier by the fact that
we only had to follow walls for
most of the way. All three of
us fell into the marsh at some
point and had the pride of
standing in Cumbria and ‘spraying wa-
ter’ into Northumberland. There was
also some very interesting moss (okay
that’s my sad bit). We had guessed it
would take us around four hours to get
down into Alston and soon after the
cloud was cleared by the biting wind
we could see it, a small town nestled in
the Pennines. A few barbed-wire fenc-
es, me getting an electric shock and
some gate-vaulting later, we arrived in
Alston to find the mini-bus, but no one
else. Like good students we went to the
pub. We did the walk in three hours.
It turned out, an hour later when the
others on the ‘shorter’ walk arrived
that they had got lost (on one of the
most well-marked long distance paths
in Britain) and had headed up into the
moor in the rain. Needless to say eve-
ryone had fun and thanked us for not
leaving them a compass, the medical
kit or any biscuits. The drive back and
the pub food were great and went with-
out incident, except that now the bus
smells like mud, wet, fish and chips,
kebab and cow-dung. Can you get ris-
ing damp in a minibus? No wonder
they normally give us the old ones.
