Airports and queues
O
f all the witty com-
ments I’ve stolen over
the years and passed
off as my own, one of
my favourite has to be
the one about national pastimes. After
laughing at the Labour Party, queuing
seems to come a close second to laugh-
ing at the Conservative party as the
English national sport. The French, on
the other hand, seem to prefer whiling
away the lazy summer days by going
on strike. Granted, the two activities
do tend to go hand in hand; especially
at airports, where one can get as much
experience of both as one could possi-
bly want.
I’ve done a fair bit of travelling, and
have spent more than my share of time
at airports around the world. In fact,

Why is free education unrealistic?
T
his week, Angry Geek
comes to you in a slightly
different form. Due to a
sequence of events that I
can only describe as “not
hilarious”, I have injured my right arm
and as a result am using one of these
quite dubious speech-to-text pieces
of software. Nevertheless, despite
the fact that I’m having to speak this
week’s rant into a microphone, thereby
irritating the unfortunate sod living
next to me, I’m going to do my best to
maintain the usual level of hatred and
bile that I’ve kept up quite well so far.
This should be quite an easy task this
week, though, given that this week is
the week that the Union staff chose to
bring out the ridiculous debate that I
commented on last term.
Yes, it’s that old chestnut: Should
we be getting our education for free
or not? Should we instead pay for the
privilege of being treated like children
over a further four years and then
dumped into an industry that no doubt
doesn’t want us due to impending re-
cession that comes thanks at least in
part, ironically, to the fact that the gen-
erations before us had their education
paid for.
I should probably point out before
we go any further that there is a slight
bias in this week’s column. You may
find the sensation familiar.

“
I might be a
cynical bastard
and the Union
President might
be an over-
politicised loon
but all that really
matters is that
your opinion is
heard
”
It’s not that I don’t think that free
education is “unrealistic”. Of course I
do. I think many things are unrealis-
tic; for example, a contestant on Deal
or No Deal that doesn’t feel the urge to
gamble at every opportunity she has,
a Green policy that has actually been
thought through past the point where
we tear down nuclear reactors, or a
politician that thinks that “Labour”
and “Conservative” are not the only
two ways of assessing a problem.
Similarly, I believe in many “realistic”
things are completely not-allowable.
For instance – and I do promise you
that I genuinely believe this – I do be-
lieve a government should be able to
hold a terrorist suspect for as long as
they like. However, the idea of allowing
any real government to do such a thing
is verging on madness.
So maybe “realism” doesn’t matter
when it comes to actually fighting for
something. If free education is unre-
alistic, then why is it unrealistic? Do
we want it to be unrealistic? It seems
to me that the whole point of politi-
cal debate is not that we decide what
is possible and not possible now, but
that we decide how we want society
to be in the future. I’m not saying our
Union President is wrong to call free
education unrealistic, but I do think is
wrong to disregard the idea solely on
that basis. Of course it’s unrealistic. So
was the Spice Girls comeback.
I also disagree with the way in which
the free education argument is being
dressed up as completely unreason-
able. As students our initial bargaining
position should be exactly that – why
should we want free education? We
may feel that we have a debt to pay to
society, or that we in some way owe
someone something for what we have
gained.
However, I admit that considering
the Union, or indeed the NUS, as an
evil, manipulative, or malicious body is
somewhat over the top. The truth is
that of course we owe someone some-
thing. But just as it is reasonable for the
public to suspect students of stealing
four years of free grants and bursaries,
it is also reasonable for us to assume
that universities or the government
may exploit us if they are allowed to
charge us what they wish.
Perhaps that makes my position on
the free education debate – that the
system that we currently have performs
well enough – slightly untenable, if you
frame it in the context of me just op-
posing it for opposition’s sake. Maybe I
just don’t understand why change is al-
ways the first thing we look for. If uni-
versities are low on money, not receiv-
ing enough funding for the number of
students studying, or the government
feels we aren’t paying enough, maybe
there are other causes and, more im-
portantly, other solutions. Maybe we
should reconsider whether it was such
a good idea to lure as many students
as we could to university in the first
place? Maybe we should ask ourselves
if postmodern art on the walkway
walls and ridiculously-branded “cente-
nary coffee” are a better way of spend-
ing the University’s money than, say,
something that actually benefited the
students.
The point is that we can split hairs all
day, and poke holes here and there like
a production line worker at a condom
factory. All that matters, at the end of
the day, is what the majority believes.
And so all I can say is this – I bloody
well hope that you filled in the Higher
Education survey. Because I might be a
cynical bastard with nonsensical opin-
ions, the Union President might be an
over-politicised loon, the NUS might
be so far up their own arse that they’re
beginning to resemble one of Esher’s
impossible shapes; none of that actu-
ally matters. All that matters is that you
voice your opinion, and a majority get
represented at the conference.
Whichever side of the debate wins
out, at least this time the student body
can show itself to be vaguely involved.
I know that may sound a little unreal-
istic, but I’m sure you configured me to
believing in it anyway.

Some
people dislike
queues. Others
get impatient
at them. There
also exists a rare
breed whose
hatred for them
extends to a
simple refusal
to acknowledge
their existence
Luton Airport: If we call it a line
instead of a queue, that reduces
the wait in queue time, right?
I’ve probably spent more time at air-
ports than I have on airplanes. Most
of it waiting around in queues. Now,
some people dislike queues. Others
get impatient at them. There also ex-
ists a rare breed whose hatred for them
extends to a simple refusal to acknowl-
edge their existence. One of the more
obvious traits that I inherited from my
father is this last quality; an indescrib-
able gut-wrenching loathing for wait-
ing in line.
This was one of the many reasons
I had trouble understanding the dis-
tinction between hell and purgatory. I
mean to say, what could be worse than
an eternal waiting room full of inter-
national passengers wondering about
their final destinations? The only dif-
ference between that and the Business
Class lounge at Heathrow is that the
seats are probably less excruciatingly
uncomfortable. Still, as I say, my out-
look has changed. Over time, I think
I’ve mellowed.
My consolation is that I haven’t yet
turned into the blissfully apathetic
drone that seems to fill queues in this
country from shopping centres to bus
stops. The reason I don’t mind queuing
so much anymore has nothing to do
with the English blood politely cours-
ing through a quarter of my circulation
system. The simple truth is that wait-
ing in line gives me a chance to observe
people in all their glorious insanity.
Let’s face it: one queue is pretty
much like another. With the exception
of where you are, who or what you’re
waiting for, and what the temperature
is, all the other annoyance factors
remain pretty much constant. For a
queue to really rank as a queue, for in-
stance, rather than just a line, the pres-
ence of a large, balding businessman in
a buttoned-up shirt open at the neck
and far too much jewellery is required.
In most cases he will be American; in
more exotic climes he may well be Ital-
ian or Greek. Whichever racist stere-
otype you care to indulge in, however,
he and his brothers will always behave
in exactly the same way. Mobile phone
in one hand, remnants of a gelling hair-
line being gently smoothed by the oth-
er, he will make it very clear to anyone
within bellowing distance that he can
pass a basic profanity test in a handful
of languages.
Dr. Murphy, whose laws apply so well
to these particular situations, accurate-
ly predicted that should you have one
such man on your right, you will have
another oilier and more impatient man
on your left. Inevitably, each will notice
the presence of the other, and unless
you particularly want a spittle shower
and a front seat at a sumo event, it is a
wise move to silently melt away.
Another of the archetypical queue-
mates is the single mother. Tired and
hassled, in airport scenarios she is in-
evitably accompanied by a small child
who is either golden-haired and hyper-
active or hugely depressed and eager
to share his emotions with the world.
In either case, the little angel will prob-
ably spend most of the waiting time
cleaning the floor with various parts of
their anatomy ill-suited to the task.
And then, of course, there’s me. Con-
descendingly looking around me as
I mentally prepare my next column;
discreetly wiping the spittle off my face
emanating from the large man on my
right and smiling vaguely at the hyster-
ical cherub running circles around my
shoes with his head. God, I love peo-
ple; we’re so inherently comical.
