T
he omens were good
– we had at least been
given a new minibus
which might not break
down… more than
twice. After the usual bout of guess-
es as to how long the drive will take,
which always ends up being ‘about
6 hours’ regardless of where we’re
going, the 13 of us finally left Lon-
don for the North Pennines. I know
that whoever is reading this wants
a really detailed description of the
journey but I’m going to deny you,
and just say that it rained when we
stopped for food - in the Midlands,
that no-man’s land of Britain. We
arrived in the tiny village of Melm-
erby at about 1am and were greet-
ed by a massive town hall which
had central heating, a carpet and
a shower! Compared to the usual
Fellwanderers accommodation of a
barn with some chickens and a few
rabid dogs prowling the fence this
was sheer luxury. The place even
had a stereo system and - unfortu-
nately - Now 65 - ‘Shakira Shakira’!
Saturday dawned and as we start-
ed the walk up into the Pennines
we could look across the Eden
Valley at the morning light hitting
the snow on the top of the Lake
District hills. We hoped that we
would get some snow on our walk
and Chris “El Presidente” teased
us with ‘maybe a little, right on the
top’. The tops of our hills were ob-
scured from about 400m by cloud
and we slowly made our way up,
past several sheep carcasses and
a large gully which Nathaniel and
I wanted to slide down just before
seeing a sign that told us to keep
to marked paths; apparently there
were Badgers nearby, or Cougars,
or a Griffin, anything was possible.
Soon after Gareth sank in a stream
and we had tried and failed to play
baseball with a crow-bar and a sat-
suma, we hit the cloud line and as-
cended into the mist. At about the
same time we began to notice small
pockets of snow, prevented from
melting by the cold; there was even
a light white dusting on the scree
we passed on the way up. ‘So this
is the snow’ we thought as I tried
and failed to throw tiny snow-balls
at everyone.
Basically about 15 minutes later
we were in a blizzard; not only was
the snow deep enough to fall into
but it was coming from the sky.
This beautiful effect when inside a
cloud is called a ‘white-out’. It was
in these conditions we explored
an abandoned silver-mine which
could have easily turned into a hor-
ror movie. For once Chris had to
crank out the compass, as we had
to take bearings up the hill, passing
abandoned mining winches and
frozen ponds. One of the ponds in
particular looked ‘solid enough to
stand on’ and so I did, and fell in -
well my leg did anyway. So that was
me cold. At the top of our first peak
A Winter's Tale
by Alexander Kendall
- Great Dun Fell - we came across the
expected radar station which loomed
out of the mist like something from
Doom. This was our lunch break and
we sheltered behind one of the build-
ings to get out of the wind. Most of
us ate except for Gareth, who doesn’t
get hungry or cold … ever … and de-
cided to build a snowman. Although it
wasn’t really a snow man but more of a
snow possessed child and it scared us
so much that lunch ended and we set
off again. The snow only got deeper as
we made our way over the next hill and
then finally a short scramble took us
on top of the highest peak of the North
Pennines - Cross Fell at 893m. We
‘sheltered’ for a few minutes behind a
stone wall, built on many mountains by
people who have nothing else to do. By
this point it was too cold to even throw
snowballs and the lack of descriptive
scenery in this report is simply due to
the fact that we couldn’t see anything.
The compass was used again to
find our way off the mountain where
we hoped to join up with the Pennine
Way which snaked back into the Eden
Valley. Since everything was snowed
or iced over this was nearly impossi-
ble but we headed in the right direc-
tion and eventually found a path, after
having to climb down the English ver-
sion of the Hillary Step in a blinding
snow storm. It wasn’t long before we
were free of the snow and then finally
the cloud as we again dropped below
400m on our return to the minibus, via
a river crossing, and again saw the Lake
District opposite bathed in sunlight.
That night we cried because the lo-
cal pub was closed but luckily Nathan-
Told you it wasn’t solid enough to walk on
iel, who doesn’t drink in January
(WHAT!) drove the minibus to
the next tiny village where there
was a pub, with a healthy selec-
tion of cake. Everyone had a pret-
ty good, chilled-out time except
for Gareth who beat everyone at
pool and got drunk in true Fell-
