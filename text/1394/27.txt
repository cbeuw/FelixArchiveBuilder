A
s everyone knows, when
it comes to camera
phones the Sony Erics-
son Cybershot range has
always had the last word.
Their latest addition, the K850i is still
pushing the technology forwards.
With a 5 Megapixel camera it is the
highest resolution camera phone avail-
able on the market and with the Cyber-
shot camera background from Sony, it
has a high quality lens, allowing it to
take outstanding pictures.
When it comes to other media ca-
pacity it still manages to hold its own
as far as music. With a mini SD slot
you can load it up with 2GB of you
favourite music and videos, not a lot I
know but it'll make those bus or tube
journeys in and out of Uni fly by with-
out getting bored. However, internet
access is where it begins to fall down.
Unlike it's main Nokia competitors,
it does not have Wifi built in. This is
not a major issue for most people but
as wireless internet hotspots expand,
more people want to be able to get
free internet on their phones. On the
up side, if you get this phone on Voda-
fone you can use Vodafone Live to read
all the latest news headlines and keep
track of sports results for free.
My main niggle with this phone is
the time delay which almost seems to
have been put in on purpose. Many a
time I have to wait for the phone's un-
derpowered processor to get around to
working out what button I just pressed
and then finally show the menu I was
expecting. I'm really hoping that a fu-
ture firmware update will speed things
up. Other people have told me of con-
cerns about the soft touch buttons on
the screen being too sensitive, so you
can press them by accident. All I can
say is that I have found no problem
with them and if you get one of these
phones, you will soon be joyfully ham-
mering the screens of every other
phone wondering why nothing is hap-
pening (yes I have done this).
Overall, once you get used to this
phone, I would say it's one of the best
on the market as long as mobile in-
ternet access isn't an issue. The new
button layout allows for a significantly
larger screen and the lack of moving
parts makes it highly durable, coupled
with a new, more protective camera
lens design.
More camera than phone

Nokia N95 - Anything you can do, I can do better
This an expensive specialised Home Theatre PC (HTPC), but you can use any old PC for the job
video and so keeps the PC stable and
ensures the recording doesn’t skip. You
could upgrade the graphics card and
have a monumental gaming PC setup
or just shove a load of hard-drives in
and keep your entire media collection
on the single PC. There’s plenty of cas-
es to choose from, so you might want
to pick a slimline system for sitting by
your TV. These systems can be found
pre-built on the high street for around
£500 and upwards, but as mentioned,
it can be fairly easy to upgrade your
own system up to scratch.
So, does your box already have what
it takes? You need to look out for a
graphics card with a DVI output. These
can be picked up for around £30 and
are a simple upgrade for any PC, you
may already have one! Then a simple
DVI->HDMI cable will connect your
PC to your TV, these are a few quid
online or £15+ on the high street. Now
your PC and TV are hooked up there’s
one final stage, the TV resolution. If
you have a 720p / 1080i TV you want
to set your resolution to 1360x768, if
you have managed to get a 1080p TV
then crank it all the way to 1920x1080.
The only thing that this setup lacks is
the inclusion of an HD media drive,
which currently aren’t at the most
student-friendly price point. There are
HD-DVD, Blu-ray and combination
drives available, starting at £100 and
the purchase of one of these will allow
you to buy all those HD movies on the
high street.
Once your hardware is chosen, pur-
chased and loosely assembled with a
hot glue-gun it’s time to choose the
software. There are loads of choices for
media centre software, ranging from
those that cost you money, to those
that are absolutely free. Microsoft
created Windows XP Media Centre
Edition for exactly this purpose, with
built in TV-tuner management and
media library functions that can eas-
ily be controlled by a remote. This is a
great choice if your PC already has it
pre-loaded, if not then Windows Vista
(Home Premium & Ultimate) comes
with the Media Centre as well. Then
there’s MythTV, a customized Linux
distribution that comes with TV-tuner
support and media centre software ri-
valling Microsoft’s system. This does
turn your box into a Linux box how-
ever, so take note that although free,
you may lose gaming functionality or
general software compatibility.
The alternative setup is to use one
of the current generations of console.
Both the Xbox 360 and the Playsta-
tion 3 have media-centre functionality.
Simply pick up the console, purchase
an HD connection for it (this will be
component or HDMI, costing around
£15) and plug it in. The Xbox 360 com-
municates with any XP or Vista ma-
chines on the network and functions as
a “media extender”. Simply put, it will
connect to the media library on any PC
and stream content over the network,
allowing you to watch DVDs and game
on the console and any other media
(such as DivX video) from your desk-
top PC. The addition of an HD-DVD
drive (approx. £100) or the possible
Blu-ray player for the 360 will get you
fully prepared for the high-def age.
A PS3 will give you a fully featured
Blu-ray player by default as well as pro-
viding some amazing quality high-def-
inition games to get started on the new
setup. Sony are improving the media
functionality for the PS3 as time pass-
es. At the moment it can play a decent
percentage of non-high-definition me-
dia files from both the audio and video
sides of the spectrum. Another nifty
feature is the PS3’s ability to browse
the internet. This is something it has
in common with its Japanese brother,
the Wii. So if you prefer to browse the
Net from the luxury of your sofa you
can. Using the same feature set the PS3
can also play media which has been at-
tached to it in the form of an external
USB hard disk, so you can duplicate
your media and watch them on the PS3
in a much more social setting.
In the end all this equipment starts
to mount up, but we think that you can
put together a very versatile and im-
pressive home-theatre setup for under
a grand. So if you split this between a
few flatmates, you may not be as far
out of pocket as you had thought.
