Varying alpha and the speed of light
Physics met anarchy at João Magueijo's inaugural lecture, with inconstant constants and laws aplenty
Brett Cherry
The title, “Anarchy and Physical Laws”
,certainly pulled them in: Blackett Lec-
ture Theatre was packed last week,
as the crowds turned up to hear João
Magueijo, Professor of Theoretical
Physics at Imperial College London
and former Royal Society Research
Fellow, give his inaugural lecture.
Magueijo was talking about the ‘an-
archistic’ idea that physical laws or
constants could vary over time, and
spent much of the lecture discussing
the constant known as alpha. In phys-
ics, alpha (α) symbolises the fine-struc-
ture constant, a name which arose as it
originally referred to the structure of
atomic spectra – the set of electromag-
netic frequencies emitted by atoms of a
particular element.
However, alpha is much more than
this: it’s also one of the primary physi-
cal constants that determines the na-
ture of the universe. Alpha is essen-
tially a 'pure' or dimensionless number,
meaning it does not have units, but
rather is a ratio of the square of the
electron charge e with the product of
the speed of light c and Planck's con-
stant ħ. Magueijo explained how alpha
is analogous to the well-known con-
stant pi (π). Like alpha, pi itself does
not consist of units, but is also a ratio
of two different lengths: the circumfer-
ence of a circle and its diameter. What
Magueijo and other physicists have
discovered is that alpha might vary
over time.
Experimental evidence mentioned by
Magueijo comes from the University
of New South Wales, where scientists
observing light from distant quasars
passing through clouds of interstel-
lar gas, reported a variation in alpha,
originating from billions of years ago.
However, Magueijo doesn’t feel these
recent astronomical observations
in themselves will lead the scientific
community to accept a varying alpha.
“No one is ever going to believe those
observations until they have a table
top experiment.”
Further experimental
observations are need-
ed to determine if al-
pha varies, rather
than remaining
constant. If it
is found that
alpha does
indeed vary
that means
one of its
constants
(which in-
clude the
speed of
light) must
give way. A
“table-top”
experimen-
tal test of
varying al-
pha might be
possible using
using atomic
clocks – if alpha
doesvaryovertime
small changes could
potentially be detected
over year-long experimental
time periods.
Since his inaugural lecture, Mague-
ijo has moved into his new office in
the theoretical physics department
in the Huxley building and is tackling
some of the biggest problems in phys-
ics, such as how to reconcile quantum
theory and gravity to get a theory of
quantum gravity. How does he plan
to do it? With new theories that have
a varying speed of light, a sacred con-
stant for most physicists. Having a var-
ying speed of light doesn't necessarily
undermine the foundations of modern
physics as we know them today, but it
does have fascinating consequences
for how we understand fundamental
physical laws.
The Varying Speed of Light (VSL)
theory which Magueijo is working on
has recently has gained a greater level
of acceptance within the scientific
community than at its inception. It re-
fers in fact to not one, but many similar
theories that claim the speed of light in
a vacuum is not always constant, but
Magueijo doesn't discriminate – “I
work on them all. I think it's too early
to become attached to one, because we
really don't know. I mean all of them
could be completely wrong.” While
VSL, like inflation, has still yet to be
confirmed experimentally, it does pro-
vide fascinating new cosmological
interpretations that simply cannot be
ignored.
VSL theory was conceived partially
in reaction to the dominant cosmolog-
ical theory of cosmic inflation which
claims that the universe underwent a
phase of great expansion following the
Big Bang. Today, astronomers cannot
see any further than 15 billion light
years – the cosmological horizon. But
the question remains – how did the
universe expand to its massive present
extent? Inflation provides no direct
answer to this question other than as-
suming that when the big bang 'banged'
the universe we live in today instantly
expanded from a singularity of infinite
density. VSL provides an alternative
explanation of how the universe de-
veloped after the Big Bang. According
to VSL theory, the speed of light was
initially up to 60 times faster than it is
today. This means
that infla-
tion is no
longer
need-
ed be-
cause, if the
speed of light
at the beginning
was much faster, it would
bring all regions of the universe to-
gether. As the universe expanded and
cooled over time, the speed of light
slowed down.
When Magueijo first published his
papers on VSL theory and varying al-
pha the response from the scientific
community was one of “bewilderment.”
Many scientists simply did not know
what to think – modifying the speed of
light seemed like heresy if not lunacy.
When the media first caught wind of
how Magueijo's VSL theory violated
Einstein's special theory of relativity,
they called him the 'punk rocker' of
physics. Who would come up with
such a crazy idea? Well... for starters
Einstein himself did back in 1911 by
claiming gravity would slow down the
speed of light. Paul Dirac in 1937 found
that the force of gravity might also vary
over time and was inter-
ested in developing a new
theory of quantum gravity
from this observation. If these
great scientific geniuses were
interested in modifying physi-
cal constants underlying modern
physics, why do scientists cringe at
the thought to- day? The an-
swer is not a
convenient
one, for it has as
much to
do with
sociology
as physics.
Magueijo
does not
see VSL as
frightening or ‘anti-
establishment’ as television and news-
papers originally portrayed it to be –
“This aura of throwing away Einstein
was complete nonsense, but people
took it that way, the interest now is
a bit more genuine, more
scientific than what it
used to be.”
Like many brilliant
scientists, Magueijo is con-
tinuing where Einstein left off.
Ironically, that includes contradicting
his theories. “Most of the things we do
in theoretical physics is question Ein-
stein, there's nothing special there, it's
basically the evolution of science, it's
No future for the 'punk-rocker' of physics? Hardly - Magueijo's got tenure now. But is he establishment then?
just the way things work.” Einstein of
course died while attempting to recon-
cile his theories of relativity with quan-
tum mechanics. He also left behind
some strange theoretical artifacts, in-
cluding lambda (Λ), the infamous cos-
mological constant. Magueijo's VSL
theory actually lays to rest many prob-
lematic issues surrounding the cosmo-
logical constant. “All these threatening
aspects of the cosmological constant,
that have created all of these problems
in cosmology, just disappear. It's not
so much as you get rid of it, it's just
that you tame it.” According to VSL
theory, the vacuum energy increases
if the speed of light increases as well,
but once the speed of light decreases,
this vacuum energy drops drastically.
Once this takes place energy from the
vacuum then discharges into all mat-
ter and radiation in the universe. This
allows the universe to continue to ex-
pand without the need for an 'all per-
vasive nothing' or cosmological con-
stant in the equation. While this may
seem subversive, it shows that in order
for science to progress it may require a
bit of anarchy.
Anarchy – order without govern-
ment or law – is the last thing one
would associate with science. Science
as an institution seems anything but
anarchistic. However, science as a
process may be more 'anything goes'
than what is conventionally under-
stood. Magueijo was influenced by the
anarchist philosopher of science Paul
K. Feyerabend, a former professor at
University of London (and friend and
colleague of philosopher Sir Karl Pop-
per) who was portrayed by academia
and the media alike as the 'arch-enemy
of science.' Yet Feyerabend may have
actually been a pioneer in developing
a radical understanding of scientific
method itself. “There is a certain ele-
ment of anarchy in the scientific proc-
ess, which people don't like to admit to
and some of it is very irrational in fact,
it’s something we should admit more
than what we do as scientists.”
Science is often depicted as an ab-
solutely certain and formal process of
obtaining knowledge that is rational
from the start. History books and the
media alike portray scientists as gradu-
ally coming to truth by reading directly
from the 'book of nature.' Magueijo
discourages any absolute theoretical
interpretation of the physical universe,
but advocates an openness that has
allowed science to progress since the
beginning. “We shouldn't be so seri-
ous about it, as if we know what the
final answer is. We don't know what
the final answer is. I have no problem
whatsoever in working on two contra-
dictory theories at the same time.”
Absolute allegiance to any particular
theory sounds like something out of
the Catholic Church, not science, yet is
it too heretical to ask if the institution
of science is taking itself too serious-
ly? In developing theories of VSL and
varying alpha, Magueijo is journeying
down a path of scientific exploration
that appears to be getting narrower
and narrower: “That kind of beautiful
openness of 'anything going' is kind
of disappearing more and more.” Al-
though he considers it a “sociological
misrepresentation,” Magueijo has been
breaking down the knowledge barriers
of theoretical physics, perhaps similar
to the way Sex Pistols or other punk
rock bands stretched the boundaries of
music as an art form.
As well as work on both VSL theory
and varying alpha at Imperial Mague-
ijo also remains focused on quantum
gravity and using VSL to explain the
fluctuations in cosmic microwave
background radiation left from the
Big Bang. “We're trying to use vary-
ing speed of light theories to generate
the fluctuations in the universe, that's
something we never did before. I also
think there is a role for varying speed
of light theories of quantum gravity.”
In the mean time, questioning physical
laws, at the very least, exercises one of
the prime movers of science – human
intelligence.
