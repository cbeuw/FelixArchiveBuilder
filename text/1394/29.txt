On A Rainy Day is an odd one.
Another game from the guys
at the Experimental Gaming
Project – it’s a game that we
can’t forget for reasons that
would worry any psychoana-
lyst worth his salt. Just wait a
second while we explain: Rainy
Day is a game in which you
build a tree. A tree of hands.
Hands that are holding umbrel-
las. Why are they holding um-
brellas, you ask? Because it’s
rainy, and otherwise the paper
boats that are floating by on
the river beneath would sink.
It’s bizarre, but charming
enough to keep you interested.
It’s worth playing just to get a
single red boat through and
witness the rain of umbrellas
and hands that follows in one
of the most Dali-esque mo-
ments in any game, ever. A
wonderfully surreal experience
that really brings out the best
in indie gaming.

OK guys, stop me when this
game concept starts to sound
familiar: you control a monkey.
Who throws darts. At balloons.
No one? Ah well, no matter.
Suffice to say that it works, in
that cartoony Flash game style
that we all know and love.
The goal of the game is sim-
ple enough: pop all the bal-
loons using a limited number
of darts, but the execution is
splendid – challenging, but
rarely frustrating and always
equally rewarding. And with
250+ levels of balloon carnage
to go through and multiple
powerups and special balloons
to keep it interesting, it can
become a lifelong addiction.
Much like heroin or World of
Warcraft (neither of which Felix
endorses, fyi.). Bloons is proof
positive that monkeys and
darts are meant to be together.
Biologists, get on it.

T
icket to Ride is an abso-
lutely top-notch game
with broad appeal, play-
ing in less than an hour
and providing much
depth without being over-complicated.
One of the most popular board games
designed in recent times, Ticket to Ride
is a simple yet strategic game of con-
necting cities with trains.
Ticket to Ride is so simple to learn
that it’s hard to write a summary with-
out giving away all the goodies. The
rulebook is just 4 pages long (including
the illustrations)! As a result, the game-
play elements behind Ticket to Ride
can be understood in 3 minutes, yet
players face strategic and tactical deci-
sions that vary with every turn. Play-
ers collect cards of various types that
are then used to claim railway routes
connecting various cities across a map
of Europe. The routes are of differing
lengths (requiring varying numbers of
matching coloured cards), and each
discrete route marked on the board can
be claimed by only a single player.The
longer the routes, the more points they
earn. Additional points come to those
who can fulfill Destination Tickets –
secret goal cards that connect two dis-
tant cities; and also to the player who
builds the longest continuous route.
The game has a nice risk-taking ele-
ment, as players must be cautious not
to take too many Destination Ticket
cards, for fear of heavy penalizations at
the game’s conclusion. There are plen-
ty of things to watch, no dice to roll
and you are mostly in control of how
well you succeed; of course, there are
plenty of ways to try to hinder others’
progress. Although unique in format,
it draws on the set-collecting aspect of
the classic card game Rummy and thus
feels familiar to many players.
Both experienced players and new-
comers alike find tension grows with
each succeeding turn with winning
strategies seemingly endless: no won-
der Ticket to Ride is one of the most
honoured board games in the world;
winning the game of the year in Ja-
pan, France, Finland, Sweden, Spain
and Spiel de Jahres (Germany’s Family
Game of the Year) – the most coveted
prize in the board games industry .
Within eight months of being released
in March 2004, Ticket to Ride sold more
than 250,000 packs. It has spawned
four editions – USA, Europe (the ver-
sion we played), Marklin/Germany
and Switzerland – with a fifth (Nordic
Countries) on the way.
As play continues the board begins
to fill with routes, pressure builds as
each player becomes increasingly con-
cerned about completing their destina-
tion tickets. Will they succeed before
another player blocks their cities? Can
they take over the long-haul routes to
get bonus points? Will they gamble on
cutting through the tunnels? With each
turn, the decision to claim a train route
now or draw more cards becomes ever
more crucial.
Unlike a lot of new board games,
Ticket to Ride succeeds in its approach-
ability, making it as appealing as classic
titles like Monopoly or Cluedo, while
still being as compelling and robust
as Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.
In other words, it’s a “gateway game”:
fantastic for new players, and equally
brilliant for hardened veterans of non-
digital fare.
The game itself is hard to criticise as
there are very few weaknesses in this
format – the only slight issue is the
board orientation which means that
depending on what side of the game
you are playing it is difficult to read the
city names upside-down. Also a basic
knowledge of geography does help in
locating the cities on your tickets as
prolonged scanning of the board or
asking a fellow player can give away
your planned route.
Really, unless you’re just totally un-
able to appreciate any board game,
Ticket to Ride is a must have for your
gaming closet. The fun, ease of play
and replayability all make Ticket to Ride
great value for your gaming pound.
First Europe, then the World Nooooo, you bastard, not there!
