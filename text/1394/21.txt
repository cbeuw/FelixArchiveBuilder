Teen pregnancy is, like, cool
There’s something about Juno, it’s
true. This small indie flick, which
first popped up on the festival circuit
in the middle of last year, has smas-
sively snowballed in influence. It is set
to become the surprise sleeper hit at
the Oscars later this month, snagging
nominations for the coveted Best Pic-
ture, Best Director and Best Actress
categories amongst others, a consid-
erable feat considering the three driv-
ing forces behind it are all 30 or under.
And so, Felix are bringing you every-
thing you need to know about the film
everyone’s talking about a week prior
to release (8th Feb) so that you can stay
top of the pile.
The appeal of Juno no doubt rests
on the shoulders of lead actress Ellen
Page who seems to have transcended
Academy perceptions of a Best Actress
candidate, beating out the hotly-tipped
Angelina Jolie and Keira Knightley. Not
bad for a young woman only featuring
in her second high profile feature. Al-
though only two years younger than
Knightley, her nod has raised eyebrows
because she is playing a child, not the
young women that Keira’s face lends it-
self to, a role that would normally only
elicit voting sympathy in supporting
categories.
Then again, it would be impos-
sible to relegate Page to a support-
ing consideration given she plays the
eponymous protagonist. Her effort-
less humour is endearing although her
stunning eloquence of speech (albeit
the voice of screenwriter Diablo Cody,
see later) allows the audience to iden-
tify with Juno on an adult level despite
the story squarely identifying her
as a child. What use is a story
of teenage pregnancy if the
central character appears
adult enough to effortlessly
breeze through it all?
Page’s downfall, however,
could be her childlike im-
age. Whilst Keira is not as
consummate an actress,
she has adult roles and
a beauty that will always
find her work, no matter
how wooden she may be.
Page has a very young
appearance that has

With more buzz than a swarm of killer bees, Juno seems to be delighting audiences of
all ages as Felix asks why a pregnant 16-year old girl has managed to cause such a fuss

A
nd so now I bring you a
small discussion of the
Oscars nods, a week late,
perhaps, but with that
time well-spent to say
something about the sad passing of
Heath Ledger. Still, you don’t know the
winners yet, so perhaps you can find
something in here to have a small flut-
ter down the bookies with.
The semi-finals are over. If your
name’s not on any of the ballots, you
better book fast to get the cheapest
ticket home. Hollywood, and BAFTA,
gave you your chance, and you blew it.
Although you may be wondering why.
Once the Golden Globes are an-
nounced, the road to the Oscars is
more a question of rearranging the
melee of names already mentioned
than picking up brand new hopes. Per-
haps a Best Picture candidate falls out
of favour but gets the consolation of a
Best Cinematography nod by the end.
Maybe you had a performance that be-
mused you by its absence from the lists
(especially with the Globes’ split cate-
gories), but unless your film happened
to make the Best Picture list, everyone
will have forgotten it ever existed until
March. The Globes set the table, you
choose where you sit, but you can’t
bring friends to dinner.
The rare thing that the 2008 cer-
emony seems to have brought so far
is following various shuffles by guild
awards, Globes and BAFTAs, the
Academy have managed to optimise
the list of nominees with real talent
being rewarded and the fluff being
bumped to technical categories. Not
that there haven’t been a few mistakes,
of course.
I’m past caring that No Country for
Old Men is the clear favourite. The
winners will no doubt be pretty disap-
pointing, but the nominations them-
selves are good consolation. Atone-
ment seems to have clung on after
being shut out by each of the main US
guild shows, and rightly so. Whilst not
a massive fan of the film, it was better
than Michael Clayton (bonus points
for anyone who saw this coming) and
No Country, and for proof that voting
members cared about the different cat-
egories out there, the limp Keira and
strangely off-form McAvoy have been
evicted. Please leave the Big Bother
house.
Acting nominations have actually
had a bit of a boost. The talents of Lau-
ra Linney (woohoo) have edged out
Knightley, but sadly Cate Blanchett’s
Elizabeth shut out Angelina. For the
men, Viggo Mortenson usurps McA-
voy and Johnny Depp got chucked in
for comedy value. Not that it matters
when Daniel Day-Lewis is still on the
guest list.
With There Will Be Blood the only
main contender as yet unseen by Felix,
it’s hard to know what to make of the
race. Joint leader in total nods, it has
generated surprisingly little coverage
for anything other than Lewis himself.
Can it be that underwhelming?
Support from this corner would go to
Juno as the best of a mediocre bunch.
However, for a bet, outside odds on
Atonement pipping No Country. Un-
likely, but more chance than Clayton.
dict the intelligence that her roles in
Juno and the 2005 thriller Hard Candy
bestow upon her. In Hard Candy es-
pecially, the shocking nature of her
scenes pushed her character beyond
the realms of realism into the ridicu-
lous, even it it was enjoyable, thought-
provoking ridiculousness. At least the
coupling of such promise with some
early Academy recognition will give
her the momentum she can hope for to
get over the notoriously difficult teen-
age barrier.
Someone who
doesn’t have
such diffi-
culty with
typecast-
ing will
be Diab-
lo Cody,
writer
of Juno
and crea-
tor of the
cool indie
edge it dis-
plays. During
the London Film
Festival, Cody and
director Jason Reit-
man brought a small
film that had a little bit of hype
around it, although with Alison Jan-
ney and Jennifer Garner the only
recognisable names attached
to the project, it was quickly
lost amongst the bigger name
projects by David Cronenberg,
Wes Anderson, Sean Penn, etc.
In the basement of the Soho
Hotel, Felix listened to the
creative powers discussing
their project with an affec-
tion that is rare among the
bigger names who churn
out hit after hit.
Cody came to screenwrit-
ing from blogging, origi-
nally, and described how
her treatment of a real-life
problem such as teenage
pregnancy could only
be handled through hu-
mour. “You can get away
with saying a lot more in a comedy
that you can in a drama” trills Cody,
delightfully oblivious to the stress that
the situation could cause in reality.
Reitman is similarly playful, taking
time out of the conference to photo-
graph the mountain of dictaphones un-
der his nose with his new iPhone. His
nomination as Best Director is prob-
ably the biggest shock of Juno’s hoard
(his only previous feature was the hit-
and-miss Thank You For Smoking) and
unprecedented in the rest of the awards
season. It was all the more surprising
given that, for all the comparisons that
have been drawn with last year’s Little
Miss Sunshine, that film failed to swing
a directing nod, so Reitman must be
pretty pleased with himself.
Indeed, I imagine the three of them
aren’t that phased by the attention at
all. These are just three young kids,
surfing the crest of a wave of praise.
New talent is always a bonus on the in-
die film scene, and that’s the one thing
that Juno brings into the world.

Juno ★★★★✫
Director: Jason Reitman
Writer: Diablo Cody
Cast: Ellen Page
Michael Cera
Jennifer Garner
This film is not quite the holy grail of
indie filmmaking the Academy may
have you believe, but it’s a good try.
Amongst the somewhat dreary and de-
pressing list of nominations, Juno pro-
vides a fun factor that would definitely
be worth going to see if you fancy a
light-hearted Sunday afternoon romp.
Indeed, it’s the very pursuit of such a
distraction that leads to the subject
matter involved, although not by tak-
ing the cinema route.
Juno (Page) is a 16 year old girl who
finds herself pregnant after a tryst with
a school friend (Cera) and follows the
course of her pregnancy. Cue the tears
and tantrums, family betrayal and poor
little girl with baby out on the streets.
Or not. Juno sees a much funnier side
to the whole thing, treating the idea of
pregnancy more as something along
the lines of a zit the week before prom.
And Juno ain’t no prom queen either,
she’s cooler than that. Instead, Juno
treats the funny aspects of pregnancy
and even the process of adoption with
a refreshing light-hearted touch that it
has used to endear itself to the world.
Ellen Page is great as Juno, albeit
with a ludicrously large lexicon, and
is matched by Michael Cera as the
would-be love interest.
Alison Janney manages to dispel the
image of the West Wing’s CJ as the dog-
loving stepmother of Juno, balancing
the frustration of Juno’s attitude to-
wards her with a real affection for
the girl to avoid any straight-forward
caricatures. Jennifer Garner is also im-
pressive, if still annoying, as the highly
strung Stepford Wife looking to adopt
Juno’s baby into her seemingly perfect-
but-childless family.
The script is the real sparkle here,
and Diablo Cody has professed many
times that the language children use is
a lot more sophisticated than you give
them credit for to account for Juno
having an intellect that has wits much
sharper than her aptitude for com-
mon sense. There are a few really good
laughs to be had here, and the scene
in which Juno goes for her ultrasound
stands out in particular for its strength,
humour and emotional resonance.
With the screenplay as the star, it’s
hard to understand why Reitman is
now an Oscar hopeful for Best Direc-
tor. Perhaps people were just happy to
see the film and grateful for the man
who envisaged it and presented it so
simplistically. Juno, in the event of a
win, will not go down in history as a
classic picture. Charm it has in spades,
but longevity is not exactly guaranteed.
As we said before, Juno is simply a clas-
sic weekend afternoon romp.
Nope, it’s not a baby, just wind
