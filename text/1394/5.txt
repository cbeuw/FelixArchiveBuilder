CHRIS
LARVIN
DEPUTY
PRESIDENT
(FINANCE
&
SERVICES)
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed most this year?
I get to meet a huge number of stu-
dents and work with some great peo-
ple who are a lot of fun. Also, it’s great
to be part of large events such as the
Union’s Freshers’ Week and seeing eve-
ryone having a great time.
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed least this year?
Juggling tasks and time management.
In my role there are a huge number
of different things to get done. It’s not
helped by people who will come to you
and expect something to be done in an
instant, but in those situations you just
need to be able to keep your head.
A difficult aspect to deal with is that
there are some people out there who
will go out of their way to make life dif-
ficult for you. It’s (usually) nothing per-
sonal, you’re in a position of responsi-
bility; an easy target.
Which qualities would you say
are needed to carry out your job?
Tolerance is useful when dealing with
Clubs and Societies; often you will
want to rip your hair out. Also, a sense
of humour is very important; you can’t
be too serious.
How was being a Sabbatical dif-
ferent to what you expected?
I was entering into it with an open
mind, and did not have real expec-
tations. Perhaps I didn’t realise how
much work there would be to do,
which means it is difficult to make the
changes you want to see.
How would you like students to
remember your term?
This is a difficult one;
obviously I’d like
see Clubs and
Societies much
better off at the
end of my year
as they are the
Union’s greatest as-
set. Also, I think every-
one would be happy with
a profitable and amazing
Summer Ball.
Do you think you’ve
achieved your aims
this year? If so, what
were they?
Yes and no. I’ve spent so much time
having to focus on the day-to-day jobs
that I have not really had a chance to
move forward with the tasks I’d like to
get done.
What has been the most impor-
tant thing you have achieved so
far?
I don’t think I could pin down one
thing, though I think relations between
the DPFS and the Clubs and Societies
are closer than they have been in the
past.
If there was one thing you could
change instantly about how the
Union is run, what would it be?
Get rid of Guilds. Only kidding, the
Faculty Unions serve an important
purpose. Probably give the DPFS the
ability to fire people out of a large
cannon. That would be fun, and I bet
people would stick to the Financial
Regulations.
How do you see the Union devel-
oping over the next few years?
Part of the Union’s mission state-
ment is to the advance the
education of our members,
and is being achieved
through our Clubs
and Societies. I would
like to see a reduction
in bureaucracy which
would more time for
personal development
and club officers come
away with better skills.
The commercial serv-
ices of the Union are go-
ing from strength to strength
and we’ve seen the Ents program
invigorated with a regular Radio 1 DJ
session twice a term which is going
to get bigger. I’d love to see successful
events running on a Saturday night; we
really should be competing with other
London SUs.
Oh, and we should have a fleet of
inflatable minibuses so when a club
crashes/rolls the minibus, only the oc-
cupants are damaged and not the love-
ly paint jobs. Lols.
Do you think there is a problem
with low turnout in the Union?
Not at all, our turnouts are above the
national average even though our stu-
dents are typically very apathetic. How-
ever it would be good to see a larger
mandate for Council officers who have
relatively important roles.
If you are not leaving Imperial
at the end of this year, will you
be involved with the Union next
year?
I will be heading back to finish my
final year of my M.Sci Geology, and I
won’t be getting involved in the Un-
ion as I think I’ve neglected my degree
enough over for the first three years.
If I were to become involved with the
Union, I think I’d only make life diffi-
cult for the new Sabbs; they wouldn’t
want me there sticking my oar in.
Do you honestly think Sabbaticals
make a difference at all?
Yes. It is important to make sure that
any organisation continues to adapt
and evolve and each year the Sabbati-
cals bring new ideas, direction and the
motivation to make changes happen.
However, they wouldn’t get much done
without the staff and volunteers.
Do you feel an urge to get into
mainstream politics?
Even before I stood for election I knew
I didn’t have an interest in politics, and
I still don’t. It’s not for me; I’m happy
with my rocks and colouring-in maps.
How much money have you
embezzled?
What? Me? Don’t know what you’re
talking about. Don’t even know what
emfrazzle means.
KIRSTY
PATTERSON
DEPUTY
PRESIDENT
(EDUCATION
&
WELFARE)
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed most this year?
I’ve really enjoyed ranting at the right
people. We all know the feeling when
you spend a few hours complaining
to anyone who will listen about un-
fair regulations or inadequate facilities
(probably over a pint in the Union bar).
It’s a calming feeling but lacks the sat-
isfaction of knowing you’ll influence
someone with the power to change it.
DPEW allows you to do both!
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed least this year?
High expectations from others on what
you can achieve by ranting at the right
people. Taking on board what some-
one tells you and saying you will try to
sort it out can give them a real sense
of hope. However, it is difficult to en-
act real change quickly or noticeably
which can be quite depressing. You
have to have a lot of stamina to keep on
top of the issues.
Which qualities would you say
are needed to carry out your job?
Argumentative, opinionated, self-
righteous. Not necessarily all good
things! You need to be able to stand
your ground and forget about it if you
think you will be shy in meetings or in-
front of people getting paid a lot more
than you. Of course you also have to be
ready to listen and proactively encour-
age people to come to you with prob-
lems. Negotiation skills are essential!
How was being a Sabbatical dif-
ferent to what you expected?
The attitude of College Staff is very
different from what you would expect.
They are usually really pleased if you
spend a bit of effort finding out what
people think or presenting a strong
opinion coherently. Despite people
constantly complaining about College
they don’t often get to hear about it so
are pleased when someone is honest.
How would you like
students to remem-
ber your term?
Like a goldfish after a
night on the tiles.
Do you think you’ve
achieved your aims
this year? If so,
what were they?
I started
out with
the first set
of training
for aca-
demic and
welfare reps
and have been
drafting a Guide for representatives
throughout the year. A lot of things
that you include in your manifesto are
working projects throughout the year
and hopefully people will begin to feel
the benefit of them next year. So far I
think I’m on track.
What has been the most impor-
tant thing you have achieved so
far?
We have been awarded Fairtrade
University Status. This was quite big
on my agenda when running for sab-
batical. Also discounts for students in
Southside who were affected by build-
ing works and portacabins outside
their windows was a big achievement.
There are still a lot more battles to be
won though.
If there was one thing you could
change instantly about how the
Union is run, what would it be?
No comment. I feel this may breach
some sort of protocol.
How do you see the
Union developing over
the next few years?
This could be any-
one’s guess. With
sabbatical turnover
being so frequent (in
terms of other posts
in the College) it is
great to see the
Union constantly
changing. Ob-
viously the re-
development
will see a lot of
physical chang-
es in the building
and will improve
our space. I hope to
see academic rep-
resentation getting a
boost in the next few years too!
Do you think there is a problem
with low turnout in the Union?
Yes but this is reflected across the
Country in other Unions and in Gen-
eral Elections too. Apathy is very much
in vogue right now. I think, with some
strong candidates, the elections will get
a lot more exciting and increase turn-
out. Myself and the rest of the team are
actively encouraging anyone to stand
and get more involved in the Union.
If you are not leaving Imperial
at the end of this year, will you
be involved with the Union next
year?
I hope so. I’m involved in the union
because I enjoy it and because I think
I have something to offer. I wouldn’t
want to step on anyone’s toes so any
position I take will be in consultation
with my successor. I imagine I might
take a more active grass roots role or
may drop back down to Faculty Union
level. I’ll try to be neutral as much as
possible.
Do you honestly think Sabbaticals
make a difference at all?
Not as much as you might think. Or
certainly not within the Union. Any
grand plans to dig up the quad and in-
stall a Fish Pond will just be put by the
wayside. There is simply not enough
time to change the world because you
are deeply involved in the day to day
tasks that the world would fall apart
without. So yes and no really.
Do you feel an urge to get into
mainstream politics?
A bit. But given that I feel an urge to
get into law, teaching, climate research,
management in the charity sector, vol-
unteer/foreign aid work, renewable
energy and planetary Geoscience I
wouldn’t put that down to a Sabbatical
year. It’s part of me keeping my options
open or being indecisive.
