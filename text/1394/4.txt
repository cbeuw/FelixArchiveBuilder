Union Elections 2008
Current Sabbatical Interviews
Passing on the mantle
STEPHEN
BROWN
UNION
PRESIDENT
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed most this year?
I have really enjoyed meeting and
working with such a diverse range of
people. It was a bit bizarre being elect-
ed to work along side other sabbaticals
that I didn’t really know that well but it
has been good fun.
I’ve also enjoyed meeting a lot more
of the student body than I did as an
undergrad. One of the most reward-
ing parts of this job is seeing the sheer
number of students currently engaging
in Union activity and I think it is fan-
tastic that this is still the case given the
high workload that students at Impe-
rial have.
What aspect of your work have
you enjoyed least this year?
All of the sabbatical officers came in
to post with a great deal of enthusiasm
and a lot of really good ideas. What has
been frustrating is that you realise that
the implementation of something new
does not happen overnight and that it
takes a lot of time and effort to see any-
thing substantial come to fruition.
Which qualities would you say
are needed to carry out your job?
You definitely need a sense of humour
for this job combined with an ability to
step back from it all. With the number
of hours you put in it can be dishearten-
ing when some things don’t go accord-
ing to plan so you do need to be able
to put things into their proper context.
You can at times feel bogged down and
feel like the job has consumed you but
when this happens you need to be able
to try and focus on the successes.
How was being a Sabbatical dif-
ferent to what you expected?
Not radically different. I was involved
with the Union and Felix before I stood
for this position so I did have a good
idea about
how the place
operates.
However,
I did under-
estimate how
much my first
few months in
office would be
dictated by issues
that were rolling
over from my pred-
ecessor’s time. This
wasn’t necessarily a
bad thing but it did take
me aback slightly.
How would you like students to
remember your term?
I don’t – that would be terribly
narcissistic.
Do you think you’ve achieved
your aims this year? If so, what
were they?
I do keep reading my manifesto on a
monthly basis but it is very difficult to
find the time to focus on the things I
still have left to do. My manifesto con-
sisted of a lot of little things, a lot of
The infamous Sabbatical 2007/08 photo. Look at them. So happy, weren’t they?
O
n Monday nominations
for the 2008 Imperial
College Union (ICU)
Elections opened. Since
then, more than ten
people have already put themselves for-
ward for the various Sabbatical Officer
positions and many more are expected
to follow over the coming week as the
deadline for nominees approaches.
This time last year the five people
featured on the next three pages en-
tered the 2007 election race and suc-
cessfully managed to convince the vot-
ing student body that they were worthy
of their respective positions.
Felix interviewed each of the current
ICU Sabbatical Officers to find out how
their terms have been, whether they
have enjoyed their time in office and
what the future holds. Don’t worry, the
Felix Editor didn’t interview himself;
Politics Editor Kadhim Shubber posed
the questions in this feature.
If you’ve already put yourself up for
nomination or you’re dilberating about
whether to do it, read these interviews
and hopefully you’ll get a better idea
of what it’s like to take a year out from
your studies and to work in the Union.
The Union is run with students at the
helm, for students. If you feel up to the
task, log on to www.imperialcollege-
union.org/vote and stand for election.
You will need to get twenty of your
friends to login and second you too.
Nominations close on Monday 11th
February! Good luck.
which have been delivered and I still
have 5 months left. This year has seen
increased support for Faculty Unions,
a more diverse catering offer intro-
duced and I even stuck to my promise
of constructive engagement with the
National Union of Students despite my
own personal misgivings.
What has been the most impor-
tant thing you have achieved so
far?
Securing the funding for the Union
Building redevelopment was a mas-
sive step forward. We have use of a
great building over in Beit Quad and it
is good that the College has acknowl-
edged that if the student body is to get
the full benefit from it then it needs
modernisation.
If there was
one thing you
could change
instantly
about how the
Union is run,
what would it
be?
Personally I would like to see
the profile of our student wel-
fare and our capacity for academic
representation given a bit more promi-
nence. I know these issues are a lot
duller than clubs, societies and social
events but they are the Union’s reason
for being and in my view it is impor-
tant that this ethos is not lost. Being a
Students’ Union makes us sound a lot
more authoritative than if we were a
Students’ Social Club and I would like
to take this
How do you see the Union devel-
oping over the next few years?
The Union is currently going through
a process of significant internal change
which is not immediately obvious to
the student body. We have got very
good participation in student activities
but we would like to increase partici-
pation on the welfare and representa-
tion side of things.
Do you think there is a problem
with low turnout in the Union?
Compared to other institutions our
election turnout is actually quite good.
There is always room for improvement
but it is the elections candidates who
drive up turnout so in order for turn-
out to increase we need a lot of people
running for positions and doing some
good old-fashioned campaigning.
If you are not leaving Imperial
at the end of this year, will you
be involved with the Union next
year?
Not applicable – I am out of here!
Do you honestly think Sabbaticals
make a difference at all?
Yes I do. Decisions taken by the man-
agement of College affect us all and in
my view the most important role that
sabbatical officers play is giving stu-
dent input whilst decisions are being
taken. If there were no sabbatical offic-
ers then students would find it consid-
erably more difficult if they had a prob-
lem with their course, accommodation
or even the food in the JCR if they had
to do the work from scratch.
Do you feel an urge to get into
mainstream politics?
Not at all. I want to get a proper job
when I leave the College in a few
months. Personally I think that a law
should be passed putting a lower age
limit on our politicians. That would
then save us the ridiculous spectacle of
sabbaticals leaving the Students’ Union
bubble and thinking that their opinions
on war, peace and the health service
are of any remote use to society.
