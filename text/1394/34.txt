Chuck likes big butts and he cannot lie
When a chick walks in with an itty-bitty waist, Chuck thinks “What the fuck is she doing at Imperial?”

A
fter last week’s article,
Chuck Norris’ email has
been inundated with
emails from fangirls. But
Chuck Norris has little
use for women. To Chuck Norris, the
word wife is an acronym that explains
what women are for: washing, ironing,
fucking, etc.
Statistics speak for themselves: 50%
of women have lower than average IQ.
That’s pretty amazing when you com-
pare it to guys, of whom 50% have a
higher than average IQ.
Girls usually played a very small role
in Chuck Norris’ life, but the years have
not been kind to Chuck, and recently
he’s been longing for some lovin’ from
the weaker sex. That’s not to say that
any males are the stronger sex. at least
not compared to Chuck.
Chuck Norris likes girls of all kinds,
and all kinds of girls like Chuck Norris.
Lesbians do not exist for Chuck Nor-
ris, as lesbians are women who have
not yet met Chuck.
All of last week, Chuck Norris was
busy checking out the union. Unfortu-

The lack of girls in Imperial has been
taking a toll on poor Chuck Norris.
The girls are all either indistinguish-
able from guys, weigh as much as five
guys, act like guys, or are guys.
Just drop into the Sci-fi library. Eve-
ryone has long black hair and a long
black trenchcoat, regardless of gen-
der. Chuck Norris approves of this
equality!
For this week’s sweet CNUT, you
have to guess whether the person in
the photos on the right is engaging in
sexual activity (of any kind) or they are
just extremely happy (or scared) to see
Chuck Norris.
This way, Chuck Norris kills two
stones with one bird — the quiz is done,
and his sexual appetite is satiated.
Once again, send your answers to
coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk for the
chance to win a prize at the end of
term, which may or may not include
alcohol and a Chuck Norris mug.
Chuck Norris promises to get the
league table ready by next week, so
good luck and remember, if at first
you do not succeed, you’re not Chuck
Norris.

Wally was on page 18 in Arts!
Some fans have emailed in suggestive photos as a sign of admiration
nately it was filled with Americans on
joke courses such as “Golf-ball Clean-
ing Studies” and “Midget Workforce
Management”.
Not only do they come to London for
joke courses, but they can’t take their
alcohol either. Unlike Chuck Norris,
who has never had an alcohol prob-
lem (although alcohol has had a Chuck
Norris problem), they always seem to
end up outside on the ground, cry-
ing, like last Friday. They even had the
cheek to argue that Ringo Starr is the
worst Beatle, and that the New York
Giants are the best team. Chuck Norris
promptly gave them a roundhouse kick
in the face.
Do note, though, that Chuck Norris
has nothing against Americans. In fact,
some of his best friends are Americans!
Anyway, back to the topic of girls.
Chuck Norris sleeps with every woman
in the world once a month. That’s the
reason they bleed every month. Un-
fortunately, it also causes them to get
pretty irritable. Chuck Norris knows a
lot of things, even where Wally is hid-
ing, but one thing Chuck does not un-
derstand is women.
Women are both fascinating and
scary. Of course, Chuck Norris isn’t
afraid of anything – he does sleep at
night with his light on, but that’s only
because the dark is afraid of Chuck
Norris. But women, they are incompre-
hensible. One minute they love Chuck
and send him love letters, like the hot-
tie fangirl on the left, and the next day
they act as cold as the dead thetans
Chuck has scattered all over the world,
as if Chuck had roundhouse kicked the
girl in the face and then impregnated
her. That is impossible because Chuck
Norris’ bearded little legion of swim-
mers only do what Chuck Norris tells
them to do!
So next week Chuck Norris will
be out on the prowl in dBs; although
Chuck Norris does not dance, he
roundhouse kicks to the sexy beat!
Ladies should be aware that Chuck
Norris is always on top when he has
sex, because he never fucks up.
In closing I’d like to say: there are two
fish in a tank. One shouts to the other:
“You man the guns, I’ll drive!”
