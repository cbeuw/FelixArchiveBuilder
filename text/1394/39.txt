Zone 70 – 80% will help develop
your cardiovascular system. This is
the body’s ability to transport oxygen
to the working muscles and transport
carbon dioxide away from the working
muscles. As you get fitter you will im-
prove your aerobic capacity.
Zone 80 – 90% will help to develop
your lactic acid system and find out
your anaerobic threshold. During this
zone the amount of fat being used as
energy is greatly reduced and the gly-
cogen stored in your muscles is used.
One of the waste products of burning
glycogen is lactic acid which builds up
in the working muscles. Your anaero-
bic threshold is the point where your
body cannot remove lactic acid from
the working muscles quickly enough.
There is only a certain amount of lac-
tic acid which the muscles can tolerate
before fatigue and soreness sets in and
the exercise must be stopped. You can
delay the onset of fatigue through cor-
rect training of the lactic acid system
and you may be able to increase your
tolerance to lactic acid build-up.
Zone 90 – 100% is only possible for
short periods of time and can help to
develop speed by training your fast
twitch muscle fibres. Only the very fit
are able to train effectively within this
zone. It is recommended you seek ad-
vice about the correct way to train in
this zone due to the risks associated
with high heart rates.
Hopefully now you can find out if
your current exercise sessions have
actually been making a difference to
you. If they haven’t then you should
now have an idea of what intensity you
should be training at for certain re-
sults. If you can’t get hold of your own
heart rate monitor then fear not… our
range of cardio machines in the gym
have heart rate monitors built in which
you can use whilst your exercising and
we can help you work out your THR
so you can get the most out of your
workouts.

Monitoring your heart rate
Holly Plumley

Did you know your heart rate can be
used as an accurate way of measuring
your aerobic exercise intensity and is
an extremely useful tool in monitoring
your progress to reach your training
goals?
There are many types of heart rate
monitoring devices available. The most
popular and with the latest technology
are watches combined with a transmit-
ter belt. They work by strapping the
belt containing electrodes across your
chest and as you start exercising the
electromagnetic signal is sent to the
watch receiver where the heart rate is
displayed on the face.
Buying and using a heart rate moni-
tor can only be beneficial to you if
you understand the heart rate read-
ings you get when you’re exercising
and also knowing what the limits are.
Firstly you will need to find out what
your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is.
This is the heart rate reading that you
can achieve during maximal physical
exertion. It is not the maximum read-
ing you should obtain often during ex-
ercise and if you are starting out with
an exercise regime you should perform
this test in the presence of qualified
staff due to the risks associated with
high heart rates. Your MHR is used as
a base number to calculate your Target
Heart Rate (THR) for exercising. If you
can’t get round to doing a MHR test
on a cardiovascular machine there are
many different formulas you can use
to estimate your MHR, the most com-
mon being HR max = 220 – age. This
is only to be used as an estimate as it
can very significantly depending on
the individual.
Your THR is a desired range of heart
rate reached during aerobic exercise to
make your heart and lungs receive the
most benefit from a work out session.
THR can be calculated by using an in-
tensity range of 50% - 80% (see chart
below.) One way to calculate your THR
is the Karvonen method, this uses your
Resting Heart Rate (RHR). The average
adult male’s heart beats at 70 bpm and
the average adult female’s heart beats
at 75 bpm although again this can vary
depending on the individual. To find
your RHR count your pulse for one
minute as soon as you wake up whist
still in bed. You can average your heart
rate over three mornings to obtain
your average resting heart rate. When
you have both your MHR and RHR you
can use the Karvonen formula THR =
((HR max – HR rest) x %Intensity) +
HR rest
Making sure you are exercising in the
correct THR zone will improve your
progression at that particular intensity
and enable you to achieve maximal re-
sults. It is also a good way of keeping
you on track and maintaining motiva-
tion to keep up your aerobic exercise
sessions. The different exercise zones
help specify the best THR for you to
train in and therefore enhance your
fitness.
Zone 60 – 70% helps develop basic
endurance and aerobic capacity. It can
also help you lose weight by fat burning
which is when your fat provides some
of the total energy you need to keep
going. This is most beneficial when
exercising for a duration of 40 minutes
plus. The longer you exercise at this
intensity the more fat you will use up
for energy. If the intensity of exercise
is increased then the fat contribution
will decrease.
