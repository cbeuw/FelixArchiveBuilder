Fun & Games
Virgo
Your depression
at lacking feet has
forced you into a
depressive cycle
where every night
you question your
own existence. Your pain and anguish have
pushed you to the extreme that you plan on
stealing feet from your housemates whilst
they are asleep. Terry wakes up at 3am to find
you with local anaesthetic in one hand and a
hacksaw in the other. What will you do?
Scorpio
You find Terry’s
talk so fascinating
that you decide
to become a
lumberjack. You
realise that your
lack of feet might hinder your entry into the
world of all things arbourial. You decide to
fashion prosthetic feet out of a lovely oak tree
in your garden. The skill with which you carve
out some feet out of timber will demonstrate
your skill with trees you think.
Libra
In the heat of the
moment you explain
to him that you are
learning woodwork
and want to practice
on his chest-of-
drawers. The reason you have the anaesthetic
you tell him is because you believe that wood
feels pain. Terry then spends 4 hours explain-
ing to you how trees grow and you find his talk
immensely interesting.
Sagittarius
On Wednesday you
climb to the top of
the oak tree finding
a branch that you
will claim for your
prosthetic feet.
However, due to your lack of traction on the
end of your legs, you slip and in your footlust
fall to your death into a rosebush. The moral
of the story is if you have no feet, then just
learn to walk on your hands. Or go round in a
wheelchair I guess.
Capricorn
The toilet has been
looking very dirty
recently so today
you decide to clean
it. In your zeal you
drop your wallet
down the toilet. However, your knowledge
of the sewer systems is questionable and you
flush the toilet thinking it’ll turn up in the
sink. I guess that Aeronautical Engineering
degree amounted to nothing, Jov.
Cancer
Upon hearing about
Jeremy Beadle’s
death you make a
witty comment that
goes like this, “Well
I guess Beadle’s
about... six feet under ground!” Your friends all
laugh, but Jeremy’s bearded daughter, Jeremia
overhears your comment. She takes you to
court, the jury are horrified and reinstate the
death penalty just for you. So shut up.
Gemini
You give a little love
and it all comes
back to you, laa
laa la la-la-la-laa,
you’re gonna be
remembered for the
things that you say and do, laa laa la la-la-la-
laa. Well, when I say you, I don’t mean you
personally because you’re a dick. Don’t take
this personally but people have been talking
about you, and it is firstly, fucking disgusting
and secondly, all true.
Leo
Tomorrow,
tomorrow never
comes. What kind
of fool, do they take
you for? Tomorrow,
a resting place for
bums. A trap set in the slums, but you know
the score. You won’t take no for an answer, you
were born to be a dancer now. It is a tragedy
then that you have no feet, just stumps. They
call you Stumpy Rick and it depresses you
intensely despite laughing it off in public.
Taurus
Just this week you
get some time to
yourself and you
think, “I know, I’ll
take a bath and
read that book I’ve
been meaning to read for weeks.” But shock
and horror, at that instant your eyes fall out
and your skin somehow converts to Caesium,
highly volatile upon contact with water. This
all puts a downer on your week, but don’t
worry, eventually you’ll die.
Aries
You could’ve been
anything that you
wanted to be. But
don’t it make your
heart glad that you
decided, a fact you
take pride in, that you became the best at
being bad? You could’ve been anything that
you wanted to be but instead you ended up at
Imperial studying Joint Maths and Computing,
depressed and alone. Oh and ugly.
Pisces
So you wanna
be a boxer in the
golden ring? Can
you punch like a
southbound freight
train? Tell me
just one thing. Can you move in whirl like a
humming bird’s wings if you need to? Can you
bob, can you weave, can you fake and deceive
when you need to? Well, you might as well
quit because you are so depressingly ugly I just
coughed up a child.

H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week it is the
dawning of your age.
Come on, you must
get that reference
from the Sixties?
Ah, I’m wasted
on you. I am going to write you a horrible
horoscope this week now. You are fucking
ugly, I mean seriously, horribly, terribly painful
to observe. You inflict glaucoma on people by
your mere presence. I threw up ten times just
from talking about you.

How to rate yourself:
Under 8 words: Ordinary people live and
learn. You just seem to live. Now go away
or I shall taunt you a second time.
8 - 13 words: Calling you stupid would be
an insult to stupid people. Don’t feel bad,
a lot of people have no talent.
14 - 19 words: Careful now, don’t let your
brains go to your head. Must try harder!
20 plus words: You’ve been straining
your brain. Nice one!
Last week’s solution:
The seven letter word was:
DYNAMIC
Congratulations if you got dynamic...
ahem!
Other words included:
acid, acidy, amid, amin, amnic, ayin, cadi,
caid, cain, candy, canid, cnida, cyan, cya-
nid, cyma, damn, maid, main, manic, ma-
nym mica, mina, myna and nicad.
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter.
Capitalised words, conjugated verbs
(past tense etc), adverbs ending in
“-ly”, comparatives and superlatives are
disallowed.
Clearly a word that is not allowed this
week is: sudoku, because you are clearly
missing an s, u, d, o, k and u from the
polygon.
