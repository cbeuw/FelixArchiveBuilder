Bell tolls for Reynolds Bar:
Last orders at 10:30pm

ICSM Union President requests students to improve behaviour
after complaints, damages and verbal abuse to security staff
Complaints have forced the Reynolds
Bar on the ICSM (Imperial College
School of Medicine) Charing Cross
campus to bring forward its closure
time for an indefinite amount of time.
The Reynolds Bar, run by the ICSM
Union, is the social centre and forms
the hub of most their social activities.
The bar will now shut at 10:30pm
every night of the week, half an hour
earlier than its usual closing time and
two and a half hours earlier than its
Wednesday and Friday night licensing
time of 1:00am. The decision to change
the opening hours was announced last
Friday by the ICSM Union President
Tim Wills following a spate of inci-
dents over the last two weeks and a
complaint from a local resident.
Recently the Reynolds Bar has seen
widespread damage to its facilities by
drunken students including a toilet
being ripped from a wall, light fix-
tures being broken and door fittings
being destroyed by students leaving
the premises. There has also been a
complaint by a security team mem-
ber of verbal abuse from an unknown
student (currently under investigation
by the ICSM Union). The decision to
alter practices was taken following this
litany of incidents and was further in-
fluenced by a local resident’s allegation
of a student vomiting in their garden.
Mr Wills issued a statement to all
medics announcing the change in bar
practices drawing reference to these
incidents and urging them to “treat the
local residents with respect and leave
the premises quickly and quietly” in the
future. He also pledged to increase the
number of stewards on busy nights and
require the presentation of students’
swipe cards for entry on Fridays.
“This kind of behaviour, although
perpetrated by a small minority of
students, is unacceptable and I am
committed to improving the situation
for both local residents and students,”
stated Mr Wills when questioned.
Felix canvassed medics at the Sir
Alexander Fleming (SAF) building fol-
lowing the announcement. Medical
students questioned the wisdom of the
decision, fearing that an earlier closing
time would trigger a “spiralling decline”
of the Reynolds bar, which already
has a troubled financial history. They
also voiced concern that the measures
would damage many medics’ clubs and
societies which on many Fridays hold
themed “bops” and other events to
raise funds for their activities.
“No-one can be asked to pay £5 entry
for only two and a half hours,” said one
student, “we don’t want to go some-
where only to have to leave at 10:30.”
Another criticised the ICSM Union
response, calling it “over the top,” “ri-
diculous and counterproductive.”
Our sources suggest that the Rey-
nolds brings in under £100 of turnover
on most nights, but on Wednesdays
and Fridays this increases to £1.5k.
How the bar will fare with a greatly
reduced trading period on its most
profitable evenings is sure to concern
the management and ICSMU over the
coming weeks.
Out of order: one of the toilets which was damaged by students
I’ll have a jumper, two pairs
of socks and a scarf please
If you went down to the Union on Monday night you were sure
to find a surprise. Newly formed Knit Sock piled into The Union
Bar for their Inaugural Meeting. Around 30 Knit Sock members
brought out their needles and yarn for an evening or knitting and
crocheting prompting mystified looks from others entering the bar
