THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Caught 'blue-handed'
A m e m b e r of I m p e r i a l ' s
Conservative Society may face the
Union Disciplinary Committee after
tearing d o w n posters put up by the
Students Against Loans (SAL)
Campaign.
The student concerned, Dylan
James, a Maths first year, was
discovered removing posters from
the Physics C o m m o n Room o n
T u e s d a y night b y t w o S A L
supporters. When challenged, M r
James claimed that the posters
contravened Union Publicity rules
because they lacked the name of a
Club or Society a n d said that
'Student Loans would benefit every
one.'
Mr James had attended the S A L
meeting earlier that day when he
made suggestions on the way loans
should be tackled and had taken a
number of anti loans posters to pin
up.
A Spokesman from the S A L
group told FELIX that the posters
contained the logo i C Union S C C
Students Against Loans Month' and
were therefore in line .with Union
Publicity requirements. He went on
to say that ninety S A L posters had
disappeared over the past t w o
w e e k s .
Julian Moore, acting chairman of
the S A L Campaign commented ' M r
James is playing G o d with student
politics. People not only have the
right to freedom of speech; they
have the right to advertise issues
and meetings.'
FELIX received a letter from M r
James earlier in the week in which
he condemned Socialist Worker
Students' Society for allegedly
removing Conservative Society's
publicity. Later i n the week he
approached a member of the FELIX
staff asking for the letter to be
discreetly removed from the office.
The letter is reproduced here.
M r James w a s u n w i l l i n g to
comment on the incident, but I C U
Honorary Secretary Ian Morris said
that he was taking the matter
'seriously'.
Dear Bill,
There have been complaints in recent issues erf
FELIXabouttheUnion tearing down SWSSposters.
I wish to complain about SWSS tearing down
ConSoc posters.
Last Monday (13.2.89) about 50 of our ConSoc
posters were put up at 9am. By 10.30am almost all
of them had been torn down, and many of them
werereplacedby SWSSposters. Surely itistoo much
of a coincidence that so many SWSS posters were
put up where Consoc posters were.
The tearingdownof ConSocpostersbySWSS has
I beenwitnessedby non-Conservativefriendsofmine.
Ihope thoseinvolvedwillrealisethe futilityof their
I actions, and that this will stop.
I Yours sincerely,
Dylan James, Maths 1.
Bristol bomb blast
Animal Liberation Societies have
claimed responsibility for a bomb
explosion at Bristol University
yesterday morning. The incident
has led to speculation that further
attacks may be levelled at other
Universities in the country.
The bomb, which exploded at 1
minute past midnight, wrecked the
f o u r t h floor of the m a i n
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n b u i l d i n g a n d
'severely damaged' the third and
fifth floors. The building was empty
at the time of explosion.
The U n i v e r s i t y received a n
anonymous phone call at 11.40 am
warning of the bomb threat. The
b u i l d i n g w a s evacuated a n d
searched with sniffer dogs but no
signs of explosives were found and
the building was reopened at 3 pm.
Bristol University Students Union
(BUSU) Vice President Russel Payne
told FELIX that although a Union
Society which was a branch of the
'Western Animal Alliance' existed
last year, he is 'about as certain as
possible' that the bombing had
'nothing to do with the students'.
He c o m m e n t e d that Bristol
University has had a 'bad reputation
for animal experimentation' in the
past, but claimed that strong
feelings against the medical and
veterinary faculties have now 'died
d o w n ' . Professor Pearson of the
faculty of Veterinary Surgery
stressed that 'at present' h i s
department undertakes ' n o
experiments that would give rise to
any anger of any sort'.
In response to fears that the police
failed to discover the bomb on their
original search, a press conference
was told yesterday that police are
considering the possibilty that the
explosives were planted after the
reopening of the building.
A major investigation involving
200 officers has been initiated and
B U S U who described the event as
'fruitless and futile and a set-back to
the issue of animal rights' are
helping police with their enquiries.
The national Union of Students
(NUS) will be marching tomorrow
from Victoria Embankment to
Kennington Park via Whitehall in
protest at the introduction of
student loans. The march is being
supported by Imperial College
Union. Over three hundred porters
and several thousand of leaflets
have been produced to advertise the
event.
The NUS is taking steps to defend
those arrested in the November
demonstration, and are considering
pressing charges against some
members of the police.
They are working in conjunction
with Bindman and Partners
solicitors, gathering evidence from
several videos of the incident on
Westminster Bridge.
