Henry VI
The Wars o f the Ros
The Wars o f the Roses—the saga
continues.
House of Lancaster
We are thrust into turbulent times.
Henry V is dead; leaving to a baby
the crown of England. The Duke of
Gloucester is Lord Protector, and he
has not the divine authority to meld
the court together. The French have
revolted and into their ranks rises
Joan of Arc to drive England back.
Valiant Lord Talbot battles away to
save English pride, but loses the
day.
The stormy seas of strife breed
breezes of dissension. Feuding
Richard Plantagenet and the Earl of
Somerset divide the nobles of
England in two. They pluck roses as
symbols in Temple Gardens; white
for York and red for Lancaster.
While Englishmen quarrel, the
French Dauphin still fights. But Joan
loses Rouen and in a blaze of light
she dies.
The young King grows to be a
reluctant ruler. H e needs to be
strong, but his heart flounders. Into
his court comes the Earl of Sussex,
whose weasle-like words twist
closer to power. Who knows what
riches he has gleaned, for he has a
mistress w h o is also a Queen. But
he overstretches the line one day,
when he orders the murder of
Gloucester, O l d Protector.
Gloucester is strangled in his bed,
and for this pusillanimous Suffolk
loses his head.
A n d so ends part one of the reign
of King Henry. Read on for part
two, for the trouble's just started.
House of York
Henry now is an old wise man, yet
strength of will eludes him still.
Richard of York now plots against
him; stirring up revolt to unsettle
the King. A n d so in earnest begin
the Wars, between Lancaster and
York—to the victor the crown.
W h o ' s good, w h o ' s b a d w e
cannot fathom. Who's right, who's
wrong is a nebulous question. A l l
seem worthy, proud and valiant, yet
in unsettled times ambition is
rampant. Confusion holds fast with
loyalties uncertain. Fate seems
twisted as fortunes change often.
Richard's four sons fight bravely
beside him, the most cunning of all
being his namesake, the hunchback.
Battles are fought and many are
slain. Amongst them poor York who
dies in shame. But his-sons rise up
and avenge his death, and Edward,
the eldest, put the crown on his
head.
The crooked, warped figure of
Richard plans on, for it is power he
cares regardless of wrongs. H e
strikes down old Henry, locked up
in the Tower, and then plots the
downfall of his very o w n brothers.
With Henry's death, an evil mind
now plots for Yorks descent, but a
son is born to Edward much to
Richard's discontent.
E n o u g h of this verse. This
Shakespeare stuff is going to my
head! Shakespeare wrote Henry VI
in three parts. These works are
considered unwieldy by many, and
so the ESC have condensed them
into two plays—House of Lancaster
Pennington, who plays Sussex in
Part 1, and in Part 2 a punk thug,
l o o k i n g like Johnny Rotten,
spreading rebellion and preaching
anarchy.
It is a joy to see such a high level
of acting coupled with a supremely
eccentric production that never loses
its head in the maelstrom of activity,
but rather clarifies the proceeding
and makes it a t h r o r o u g h l y
engrossing, if extremely violent,
journey through history a n d I
would recommend it to anyone.
In the essence of continuity, Part
2 ends with Richard's chilling
speech ' N o w is the winter of our
and House of York. They also
attempt (successfully) to transpose
the settings to more familiar ones of
this century to emphasis the divisive
tenets held in more modern times.
Continuity of the elctric style of
presentation with the previous plays
in the scenes is maintained, but the
substance of the plays lack the usual
Shakespearian storytelling
subtleties, giving away the fact that
these were Shakespeare's first
historical plays and not, as the
production suggests, part of a long
series of chronological plays.
Both parts are serious a n d
dramatic, narrating the struggle for
the throne between the two Houses.
The productions are solid and clear
in their intentions. However, there
is a sense of being swamped in all
that is going on.
The performances are absorbing;
Paul Brennan exhibits just the right
level of insecurity as Henry VI, but
lesser roles are given greater
treatment, especially by Michael
discontent...' to usher in the next
play. So read on for the rousing and
triumphant conclusion of this
incredible saga.
Cue Richard III.

Richard III
A n d so the curtain rises to a scene
of N o e l Cowardesque figures
milling around a coffin, drinking
champagne, engaging i n garden
party n'ceties and some necessary
mourning for dead King Henry VI,
while the dulcet tones of jazz wash
over them, played by a band so laid
back they are almost falling over.
The sturdy figure of Barry
Stanton, (earlier Falstaff, Richard of
York and Chorus) cuts through this,
impeccably attired and brandishing
a clipboard, and proceeds to explain
every detail of plot and character
inter-relations of all present. The
prologue is perfectly executed (a
taste of things to come) a n d
provides a merriment and cheer
which sadly is never equalled in the
following three and a half hours.
The disfigured flautist hobbles to
the front and, sweeping a curtain
across the scene, begins the play
proper. ' N o w is the winter of our
discontent...'. The hunchback is
Richard, D u k e of Gloucester,
brother to King Edward IV, and a
man with a hefty chip o n his
shoulder. A s we have just been
warned he is about to embark o n a
dastardly plan to secure the crown
for himself.
The p l a n is so f i e n d i s h l y
contrived, and administered with
such mind blowing subtlety that it
could well be a Black Adder script.
The death count is so great that, had
it not been for the small detail of
historical fact, one could almost say
Shakespeare had dreamed this up
during his Friday the Thirteenth
phase.
As in the six previous plays, there
is strong acting by all concerned,
with a couple (John Dougall and
Sion Probert) even trying to steal a
little limelight from the true star,
Andrew Jarvis. The overpowering
combination of his natural acting
ability a n d h i s melodramatic
eccentricity gives Jarvis a
resounding victory o n that front
though. This man has real talent. He
ought to be on stage.
But back to the story: with a string
of deaths behind him, a crown on
his head, and a vengeful peerage
around him, King Richard faces a
revolt f r o m H e n r y , E a r l of
Richmond. In battle on Bos worth
field, the K i n g dies, after a rather
well choreographed and terribly
exciting swordfight. R i c h m o n d
becomes Henry VII, and gives a
television broadcast to the nation i n
the hope of uniting everybody
under the new Tudor dynasty:
' N o w civil wounds are stopped,
peace lives again; that she may long
live here, G o d say. A m e n ! ' .
Richard HI is pretty good stuff. I
found it overly long though, and as
a result remember it best for one or
two images—the dreams before the
battle in Act V Scene III, Queen
Margaret wandering forlornly,
shabby, resembling a w a n t o n
creature more recognisable i n a
corner of Leicester Square station-
rather than the performance as a
whole. It is worth seeing for
Andrew Jarvis alone however, and
I recommend it, therefore, to all.
This ambitious project, The War of
the Roses, is showing at the O l d Vic,
Waterloo Road, until March 11.
Group bookings for ten or more
students are available, as are
standby tickets, both at just £6. You
would be hard pressed to find a
more entertaining or more refined
production anywhere in London.
