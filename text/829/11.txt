violence to a level where society
could function, but were also the
catalysts for that violence. Probably
because of this, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) was formed,
semi-military police w h o were
supposed to act as a peace keeping
force. Since its members were
almost exclusively Protestant, it did
not act to ease the situation. Given
the state of other parts of the world,
the United Nations (UN) does not
seem to have Northern Ireland high
on its priority list for providing a U N
peace keeping force.
A good model to see what would
happen if the army was removed is
Sri L a n k a . T h e scenario is
depressingly familiar—the British
transferred many Tamils from the
mainland to help with tea picking.
Since independence these Tamils
removed because the original act of
colonisation was immoral. The
problem is a human one.
Some Americans who value their
Irish ancestry, a n d know their
ancestors fled Ireland because of
gross British mismanagement, still
cherish a romantic image of a
colonial Britain c r u s h i n g the
unfortunate Irish under the weight
of colonels and drill parades. This
is a view born of 3000 miles of ocean
and would be laughable if it wasn't
that they support the IRA through
' N o r a i d " . Britain is far from
perfect—that's what democracy is
for—but most Americans are only
too painfully aware that British
Imperialism was well and truly
strangled in the last war, and that

have clamoured for their own state,
a n d d u e to the complete
ineffectiveness of the law keeping
forces in that country the situation
of terrorism and guerilla warfare
between the Sinhalese and the
Tamils has slid into such a pit of
depravity that it bears well to think
of it when considering Northern
Ireland. W e are dealing w i t h
humans here, w h o are much the
same en masse whether they live in
the Indian or Atlantic seaboard.
The overwhelming fact in today's
problems is that the Protestants of
Northern Ireland are Northern Irish,
they have the right to remain and
stay British as long as they are in the
majority—they have no right to
steamroller minorities, indulge i n
persecution or rampant jingoism
simply to provoke. They cannot be
removed back to Scotland: that
would be an act worthy of Stalin's
Russia. America was colonised by
E u r o p e a n s earlier than the
plantation of the Protestants. It
w o u l d be silly to suggest that all
n o n - i n d i g e n o u s Americans be
disproportionately powerful nation.
I've not yet given my opinion on
the antics of the IRA. In my rough
draft for this my description of them
was a long string of derogatory
adjectives unfit for publication. A
different string of derogatory
adjectives could be applied to the
antics of the British Government,
but mostly retrospectively, which is
useless. I am totally uncomp-
romising in my denunciation of
murder, no matter who commits it.
The IRA would argue that the
crimes of the British Government
are greater than theirs. I would not
disagree, but I would point out that
punishing the citizens of today for
the crimes of yesterday is a
perverted and indiscriminate form
of justice. If all republicanism was
limited to Sinn Fein, I would be
pleased to accept them and watch
democracy in action. A s it is, Sinn
Fein w h o l l y condones the
murderous activities of the IRA and
makes the occasional pathetic
apology when people get killed. If
I could give some advice to them
British bombardment, 1916.
here—if you don't plant bombs, you
don't kill people; it's quite easy.
Most people manage it. In my view
they are also being phenomenally
stupid by hiding their issue—which
is legitimate—by the far greater one
of mass murder—which is not. N o
British propaganda could do more
to hurt their cause. If the
Conservative Party went round
killing people so it could pass its
legislation it would very quickly
become unacceptably unpopular!
They have virtually avowed their
intention to destroy democracy in
Northern Ireland by pressing for
what they want despite being a
minority political party. When the
vast majority of seats in Northern
Ireland go to a republican party, that
is the time for Northern Ireland to
go to Eire. I am realistic enough to
see that the likelihood of this
happening is practically zero. I
understand the origins of the IRA,
and that many Catholics feel bound
to support it as it's the loudest voice
they have. By doing so they are
approving murder, and I have yet
to work out why the Vatican hasn't
condemned them more strongly
since the IRA say they do what they
do with the backing of Roman
Catholicism, and as far as I know
this form of Roman Catholicism
died out with the Borgias.
What solutions are there? N o n e -
just stick it out—which is what the
IRA wants to get the British public
sick of. The problem is one only the
Irish can solve themselves—it is so
deep and involved, no imposed
solution w o u l d ever work. If, for
instance, Northern Ireland was
given to Eire tomorrow, what then?
A protestant guerilla army ram-
paging over the island and blowing
up the traitors in the 'Dail' at
Westminster? T h e present
Government is panicking—as can be
seen by the shooting of the terrorists
in Gibraltar. I can't truly say I grieve
much for those shot, but the outcry
was justifiable because governments
cannot be allowed to kill those who
it considers troublemakers. Also
there is this totally useless act
banning direct quotation from Sinn
Fein and the IRA. This is a superb
example of the politicians syllogism
as e x p a n d e d i n ' Y e s , P r i m e
Minister': 'We must do something,
This is something, therefore we
must do this.'
Only time will solve this one, and
that inevitably means more tragedy.
Things fall apart; the centre
cannot hold,
mere anarch}/ is loosed upon
the world'.
- W . B . Yeats.
