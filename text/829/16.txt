Doctor speaks
A number of students from the
educational 'Pimlico Connection'
group met on Thursday to hear Dr.
Anthony Michaelis, the editor of the
journal 'Interdisciplinary Science
Reviews', speak about careers i n
scientific journalism. Dr. Michaelis
was formerly science correspondant
for the Daily Telegraph.
Dr. Michaelis said that a good
scientific journalist must have both
a scientific background and a good
journalistic technique. His or her job
is to 'translate' science into the
language of the typical reader,
asking questions until the subject is
'crystal clear'.

Stingy-wingy
The top-up loan scheme access fund
will be too small, claims a report
from the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals (CVCP).
The C V C P say that the scheme
takes no account of the forthcoming
loss of social securiryHbenefits or the
introduction of the poll tax. They
also believe that it will not cater for
students on postgraduate or longer
undergraduate courses.
The committee has submitted
their o w n alternative scheme i n
which the loan would be repayable
through the tax system.

caught in
diplomatic
number plate
theft
Four students were arrested on
Tuesday night whilst attempting to
steal diplomatic number plates as
part of City and Guilds Field C u p
Treasure Hunt. After spending the
night in Chelsea police station the
students were given a formal
caution and released.
Police have asked City and Guilds
Union to remove diplomatic number
plates, bus stops and wheel clamps
from the list of items to be collected,
although they did not object to the
inclusion of policeman's helmets on
the list.
Guilds Union President, Ralph
Greenwell described the event,
entered by six teams, as 'very
successful'. He told FELIX that he
was concerned by the arrests:
'I was primary to the crime and
rendered myself liable for up to ten
years' he said.
