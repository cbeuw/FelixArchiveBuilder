Goldsmiths II—0
IC III—1
O n a day when conditions weren't
conducive to good football, IC
elected to shoot u p the slope with
a slight advantage from the strong
swirling wind. It was a blow to the
already weakened IC side when
Mike VVilks was injured early on and
IC were indeed fortunate to go in at
the interval o n level teams, helped
o n l y b y poor f i n i s h i n g b y
Goldsmiths.
In the second half Goldsmiths
threw everything into attack and
some resolute defending by Jason
Eldred and Sean Carey helped keep
IC i n the game.
With ten minutes to go, one of the
rare IC attacks led to a goalmouth
scramble and Gary Mahoney turned
up to poke the ball through a mass
of legs and into the net to score the
only goal of the game and give IC
an undeserved victory.
Saint Mary's I—0
IC III—4
Saint Mary's took the game to IC
straight from the kick off but could
not penetrate the extremely solid
looking IC defence.
Slowly but «urely, IC began to
dominate with Brazilian midfield
maestro, Toni De Leon causing all
kinds of problems for Saints. The IC
forwards could not capitalise on the
service from midfield and it took a
tremendous, looping volley by
defender Mike Wilks to put i C
ahead on the half hour mark. I C
started the second half as they
finished the first; dominating the
game completely and it wasn't long
before Derek Robinson put IC two
up. Adam,Thomas scored the third
with a scorching 25 yard drive. By
now it was all one-way traffic and
the IC forwards were queueing up
for a cross by Toni De Leon which
was eventually slotted home by
Chris Hargreaves to make it 4 for IC.
SQUASH
Onourway
The third IC Squash team is on its
way to promotion, following a
convincing 5-0 victory over Queen
Mary College on Monday.
With four matches left, the IC
team is n o w o n top of London's
Third Division. It is not only the
most successful IC squash team at
present, b u t also the most
interntional one. Colin Wraight, the
team's number 1, is a visiting
professor of Biophysics from the
United States. Joachim 'Joe' Mueller
(Physics 3) came f r o m West
G e r m a n y a n d Jonny Bell
(Management Science) travelled all
the way from New Zealand to join
this international squash 'equipe'.
Two English players, M i k e
Condon (Material Science 3) and
A n d y Webb (Civil Engineering)
complete the team which has so far
indeed proved to be 'unsquashable'.
SAILING
Gusts and
guts
Saturday's heavy, gusty winds
made the going tricky as helms
fought to keep boats under control.
In the heats the IC lsts started well,
and were soon through. The 2nds
also scraped through from their
heats—a maze of close races and
protests—with a semi-final place.
The pace now hotted up, as the lsts
win over U C L coupled with the
ORIENTEERING
Day after
O n the morning after the Hyde Park
Relays (at which the Orienteering
Club finished in under two hours
for the first time, despite a couple
of our best runners competing for
Cross-Country) the orienteers set off
bright and early for Pippingford
Park in Sussex. The courses were
laid out on hilly and barren army
land and were navigationally fairly
easy, but treacherous river crossings
and slippery banks led to criticisms
of it being an 'assault course'. With
plenty of practise on similar areas
the Club expected to do well and
most people did. Matthew Lynas
was the fastest Club member on the
day, and William Power led the
under-21 course by a large margin.
Slower orienteers were given an
extra inducement to hurry up when
it started to tip with rain while they
were still looking for the last
controls.
—— *' ' ' • - ' * * '' '
2nds victory over St Thomas'
Hospital put both IC teams into the
final. The seconds now took the lead .
as Richard and Charles, assisted by
Verity and Rob, streaked ahead,
leaving Liam languishing at the tail
of the fleet with his crew Paul, to
win. Everything now hinged on the
last race: Sarah's exhortations to her
crew were now easily audible ashore
whilst Rocky rolled as IC 1 struggled
to keep ahead and soon the efforts
of Bill, with Rory, payed off as IC
1 narrowly took the last race; but in
the end the Castaway's C u p went
to IC 2 on points.
AERONAUTICAL
Bird-like
Imagine a bird flying three times
faster than any other aircraft.
Imagine flying higher than any
other bird, so high you reach the
boundaries of outer space. Then
imagine you are that bird—the
SR-71A Blackbird.
Science can transform imagination
into reality, a n d the SR-71A
Blackbird, b y the L o c k h e e d
Corporation, is truly a thing of
beauty. Famed for being the first U S
Department of Defence 'Black'
project, the Blackbird was spawned
in the X-Series research
programmes, nurtured in the A - l l
fighter project and matured at the
L o c k h e e d ' S k u n k ' W o r k s i n
Burbank, California.
AeroSoc in conjunction with the
Royal Aeronautical Society are lucky
to have two aircrew from the U S A F
9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing,
who will be giving a presentation on
the Blackbird o n Saturday 25th
February in Mech Eng 342 at 5pm.
Please note that this event may be
cancelled at short notice due to
operational requirements. Anyone
who is interested in this amazing
aircraft really should take the time
to come along.
