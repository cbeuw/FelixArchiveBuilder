Ourselves alone
The 'Irish Problem' has a long and convoluted history, stretching back
to before the Norman Conquest. The events and politics that have shaped
Ireland are explained by A d a m Harrington, who also offers his own views
on this troubled country.
In this article, I do not propose a
solution. In fact, I propose that there
is no solution. A n y answer to the
Irish problem lies with the Irish
people themselves, although I
believe that as Northern Ireland is
a part of the United Kingdom,
mainland Britain cannot wash its
hands of the problem.
Ireland, along with Wales and
Scotland, was the lost retreat
westwards of the Celts from the
Anglo-Saxon invaders. There was
always a certain hostility towards
the English. By 1500, only a small
area around Dublin, comprising
four counties called 'the Pale', could
be considered to be under secure
English control. The phrase 'beyond
the pale' comes from this.
Ulster, an area extending beyond
the limits of modern Northern
Ireland, had always been the most
fractious part of the island. In order
to subdue the native Irish, ensure a
British presence in Ireland and to
make sure the official State Church
of Ireland, which was Anglican, had
congregations, many hundreds of
Scottish Protestants were
encouraged to settle in the North of
Ireland. They were given land and
the accompanying landowner's
rights. Those who already owned
the land were removed in an
astonishingly nifty legal move.
Native Irish Roman Catholics were
displaced and became merely
tenants. It is ironic that the Scottish
settlers were of the same ancestry as
the Irish they displaced. Also
around this time, the early part of
the seventeenth century, the town
of Derry was granted to the City of
London.
This Protestant plantation was so
successful at subduing the native
population that it was repeated
elsewhere in the world. Though
Roman Catholics were increasingly
excluded from positions of power
within the state and judiciary, there
followed a period of prosperity and
stability, if indiscriminate massacres
to break Irish resistance can be
considered stable.
The 'glorious re olution' of 1688
ousted James E of England, a
Catholic, and replaced him with the
Dutch Protestants William and Mary
of Orange. To this reallocation of the
monarchy was tied a contract which
required all future British monarchs
to be Protestants, and gave more
power to Parliament. James II
eventually went to Ireland and tried
to f o u n d a R o m a n Catholic
parliament in Dublin. Supported by
the Irish Roman Catholics, he
polarised Irish society, as the
Protestants immediately gravitated
towards William. Ultimately the
Catholics were defeated, James
retreated to the Continent and the
This, together with the wave of
revolutionary thought sweeping
Europe because of the momentous
events in Russia, brought about a
general resurgence of Irish
nationalism, verging on civil war.
There were accusations of
collusion with Germany. This
speculation was fuelled by various
shady dealings. Roger Casement,
for instance, brought German guns
to supply the insurgents and was
hanged for it. Dublin became a
centre for riots and street fighting,
out of which the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) was born. The U S A also
brought pressure to bear on Britain,

Protestants deified W i l l i a m ,
becoming k n o w n as 'Orangemen'
or 'Billy Boys'. William, to his credit,
did try to establish better relations
between the two factions. This
initiative was easily crushed by the
new, more powerful Parliament,
who intended to keep a strong
British presence in Ireland, enforced
by the Protestants, for a long time.
Over the next two centuries, there
were repeated famines leading to
mass emigrations. Bills to enact
Home Rule were introduced to
Parliament and crushed by the
House of Lords and in 1900, a
national republican party was
founded: Sinn Fein, which means
'Ourselves Alone'. The next ten
years saw more unsuccessful
attempts to introduce Home rule. At
about this time it became clear that
Ulster was demanding different
treatment from the rest of Ireland.
With the outbreak of the First
World War, British troops were
withdrawn from Ireland to be
massacred in Gallipoli and Ypres.
and in 1921 those counties which
wanted independence got it.
It is interesting to compare this
very messy path to independence
with that of India, which achieved
its independence under similar
circumstances after the Second
World War. Both affairs, with
h i n d s i g h t , were h o r r i b l y
mismanaged, mainly by the British
Government.
The six counties that wished to
remain part of the United Kingdom
occupied approximately the area
called Ulster. They stayed with the
U K because Eire was R o m a n
Catholic (Northern Ireland was still
predominantly Protestant) and also
much poorer economically than the
UK.
Eire objected to this political
division of a geographic and cultural
unit and has never reallv accepted
that Northern Ireland is part of a
different country. D u r i n g the
Second World War Eire, which was
neutral, protested to Berlin about
the bombing of U S bases in
Northern Ireland, and to London
about the presence of a foreign army
(the US) on 'neutral' soil and the
i n t r o d u c t i o n of c o n s c r i p t i o n .
Northern Ireland was, of course, not
neutral as far as the U n i t e d
K i n g d o m and G e r m a n y were
concerned.
In N o r t h e r n Ireland, the
authorities sought to encourage the
division between Protestants and
Roman Catholics and the Catholic
minority became the underclass,
experiencing persecution a n d
occupational discrimination. The
Catholics reciprocated this
animosity: the IRA became a form
of anti-Protestant harrassment. The
IRA were also irritating Eire and the
Dail (the Dublin Parliament) began
a programme of internment of
terrorist suspects in 1940 which was
adopted in Northern Ireland thirty
years later.
By 1969 the Catholics were so
intimidated by their Protestant
neighbours that they invited the
British Army in to avoid what Ed
K o c h , M a y o r of N e w Y o r k ,
described as 'the possibility of what
would, against a Jewish minority, be
called a pogrom.'
Subsequently the Catholics saw
the A r m y presence, in itself,
intimidating. Possibly adopting it as
a symbol of British (Protestant)
supremacy.
The Army started to bear the
brunt of civilian violence. Armies
are not noted for diplomacy when
attacked and they, quite
unforgivably, responded in kind.
They could manage to maintain the
British troops. Dublin, 1920.
