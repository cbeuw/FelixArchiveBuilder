Making a pinhole camera out of a
shoe box is a standard experiment
done in science classes all over the
world. Scientists i n the Optics
Section of the Physics Department
have extended this simple device
and made pinhole holograms:
h o l o g r a m s w h i c h m a y have
applications i n optical computing
and information processing.
A n ordinary hologram is recorded
using a laser beam which is split into
two. One half, the 'object beam', is
reflected off the object and onto a
photo-sensitive plate. The rest of the
beam is directed onto the plate
unaltered. This is k n o w n as the
'reference beam'.
The object and reference beams
interfere as they h i t the
photographic plate to produce a
pattern. W h e n light is shone on the
developed plate, it is unevenly
reflected i n such a way that it
appears to have been reflected off
the original object. In effect, it seems
that the object is there.
The Imperial scientists have
placed a pinhole between the object
and the recording plate. This
effectively becomes part of the
object and when the hologram is
reconstructed, all the light from it
passes through this point, as if the
real pinhole were still there. Other
devices can be placed at this point
to manipulate the image.
One of the experiments carried
out by Shenchu X u , Geraldo
, Mendes, Stephen Hart and Chris
Dainty was to make two holograms
of different objects o n the same
holographic plate, moving the
pinhole slightly each time. They
could then block out one of the
images by putting a small object
(they used a knife edge) at the
position of the appropriate pinhole,
l e a v i n g the other image to
reconstruct normally.
In this way it is possible to make
a h o l o g r a m c o n t a i n i n g m a n y
different images, each with its o w n
pinhole in an array. Shutters placed
in front of the pinholes can be open
and closed to give any combination
of these images.
It would also be possible to
replace the shutters with a liquid
crystal device which, instead of
simply allowing an image to be 'off
or 'on', could give gradual changes
in intensity. In either case, it would
allow the image, and hence the way
the light is reflected, to be changed.
It would be programmable.
Another experiment carried out at
Imperial College involved putting a
diffraction grating in the way of the
pinhole. This gives many images
side by side. Other optical elements
could be used in a similar way to
manipulate the image.

Recording and reconstructing a pinhole hologram
activates its o w n detector, then a
device consisting of a pinhole
hologram and a shutter or optical
system could act as an optical
'interconnect' or switch and so
could be used in optical computing.
So far, researchers have used
arrays of 273 points, each 50 microns
in diameter and separated by 250
microns, in their experiments giving
an image only a few millimetres
across. This is only slightly larger
than would be needed for an optical
computer, and the researchers
believe this work can be scaled
down.
