Les Parents
Terribles
by Jean Cocteau at the Orange Tree
Theatre, Richmond.
'Lies, lies, lies. Nothing but lies!'
shrieks Yvonne, over-possessive
mother and eager invalid, and i n
that freakish moment of hysterical
lucidity diagnoses the central cause
of the chaos in Cocteau's explosive
tale of domino deception.
Yvonne is lying to herself that her
cloying embrace upon darling son
Michael is a mother's natural
concern and not a blinding jealousy
of other women. Michael feels
forced by this into lying with his
silence about an ongoing affair. He
vows to let his dearest diabetic
m u m m y 'Sophie' (as he calls her in
an overly intimate game of theirs)
know the truth as soon as the
unpalatable complications are put
right: knowing that her emotional
diet is at least as critical as the sugar
level in her blood. Michael's lover
Madelaine is no less untrue in her
divided affections. Favouring the
young innocent she is dithering in
her dismissal of an older and
p r e v i o u s lover w h o , b y
uncomfortable coincidence, is
Michael's adulterous father George.
Distanced from his ailing wife,
George becomes bitter when he
discovers he is cast as the wronged
fool in a tragedy cum farce. So the
company stands cowering from
d e c e p t i o n ' s hastily t h r o w n
b o o m e r a n g as it whistles
menacingly back towards them.
Enter Aunty Leo (cooly played by
Caroline Blakiston), a model of
celibate sanity and self-declared as
the only adult amongst three
children. She constantly strives for
a semblance of order in the family's
messy 'caravan' and so seems the
ideal arbiter to help restore some
order to their chaotic lives. Leo has
long ago buried an undeclared love
and seems h a r d e n e d to the
'children's' emotional grappling
hooks. Thus qualified she is eagerly
recruited to undo deception's work
with a more sophisticated lie. Leo's
loyalties are not so certain though,
and neither are her murky motives,
until the final tragic twist.
None of the adult players can
claim a moral superiority i n this
game, though self-justification
abounds. The only true innocent,
Michael, makes naivety seem almost
a crime, but undoubtedly he is the
most wronged and it is with him
that w e are s u p p o s e d to
sympathise. Depending on one's
sympathies, mood and disposition
the whole may be read as the tragic
frustration of love, or as the
inevitable emotional melee i n the
clash of wills that is life. For this is
life with the temperature turned up
full, and the Orange Tree is just the
place to cook up such a superheated
animation. The players put in brave
and confident performances as they
flit manicly past the audience in the
aisles, often close enough to touch
and always close enough to feel the
heat.
Two minutes from Richmond
Station a n d only twenty o d d
minutes from central London the
Orange Tree is one of the most
consistently praised fringe venues in
town. This current season of three
French plays promises to be a good
time to find out why.

OPERA
La Gran Siera
era Co.
O h dear. 1 wondered • 'hat to make
of it when five db' 'ding very
large spears marchi. 'ie stage
to a tune out of 1, de of the
Valkyries (Richard Wagi.cr). I looked
again and realised that they were all
men. Why would five men, dressed
as divas, c l u m s i l y attempt
slapstick—lousy at the best of
times—singing badly. What was I
doing here anyway?
A n d that was the best part. I kept
awake, not only because of their
splendid booming operatic voices,
but because I was still wandering
what the point of it all was. It
certainly wasn't humour; however,
all around me people were snorting
and whooping. I told myself that it
was cheaper for me to sit and watch
rather than go to the pub, so I
settled down attentively.
The format consisted of parodies
of six operas. Between each parody
a transvestite i n a pink ballgown
would attract attention to himself
and crack very weak jokes.
Apparently, La Gran Siera has
appeared in N e w York, Canada,
Munich, Venice, Zurich and Berlin.
Maybe I just missed something.
Well, I know y o u have as the
performances ran from February 7th
to 18th at the Bloomsbury Theatre.
Oh, what a shame.
PREVIEW
Tequila
Sunrise
Written a n d directed by Robert
Towne (Chinatown), Tequila Sunrise
deals with the relationship between
two former high school friends,
whose lives have taken divergent
paths since graduation. Dale
McKussic (Mel Gibson) is a drug
dealer looking for a way out while
Nick Frescia (Kurt Ruseell) is a cop
assigned to put his friend behind
bars.
Caught between the two, both
physically and emotionally is Jo A n n
Vallenan (Michelle Pfeiffer).
Mel Gibson stars in his first film
since Lethal Weapon. His next film
will be Lethal Weapon II. This action
thriller pits him against Kurt Russell
(Big Trouble in Little China), forming
a combination that will have the
female population swooning. U s
blokes aren't left out either, with
Michelle Pfeiffer providing a lot of
sexual sizzle. Pfeiffer has proved
herself to be an impressive leading
lady, as we shall see in a series of
her films i n the next couple of
months—Dangerous Liaisons a n d
Mamed to the Mob will soon be
released.
This film marks another spate of
love triangle stories with The
Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
In America the film did reasonable
business, b u t w a s generally
accepted as routine d r a m a
heightened by its sexual element,
star cast and exotic look. I suspect
the same factors will make it a
success here.
Release Date: March 31st
