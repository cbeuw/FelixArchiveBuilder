theory behind this move is to
encourage the letting of more living
a c c o m m o d a t i o n b y a l l o w i n g
landlords to charge even higher
rents. Its immediate effect is
probably going to be an increase in
the present rents. According to
some sources rents in certain parts
of London are predicted to rise
dramatically. When one considers
what has happened to house prices
in centra1
London over recent years,
similar rises i n rents can only be
expected n o w that regulation no
longer controls rent increases. The
rights of the tenant to appeal against
rises, which might be unfair, has
also been reduced. The law has
swung from protecting the tenant to
favouring the landlord.
If rents in central London do rise
dramatically many people will move
outwards and rely o n commuting
long distances. Apart from the time
and inconvenience this involves, the
cost of commuting is also rising. The
latest tube fare increases at the
beginning of this year were u p to
16% more o n some tickets. A
journey involving night buses that
previously cost £2, using a one-day
travel card, more than doubled due
to the changes in ticket conditions.
London Transport has indicated its
willingness to increase its ticket
prices even further i n the future.
The Government has said that any
of the improvements needed to
relieve present overcrowding on the
public transport system will also
have to be partly funded by fare
increases.
The future may look bleak...but
what can be done?
It is essential for students to become
more aware of the changes which
are threatening their own and future
students chances of education.
Already, prospective applicants for
London colleges are reconsidering
whether the cost is worth it. Many
parents will not be able to afford the
increased cost of subsidising their
children through higher education.
The time of political apathy should
be over. The threatened changes are
imminent and if students do not
respond n o w by demonstrating
their opposition then very soon it is
likely to be too late.
Whilst the Government could be
persuaded to reconsider some of its
proposals by mass lobbying and
demonstrations it is extremely likely
that at least some of the proposed
changes will come to pass. London
students must start planning now to
face the harsher economic
environment, especially when it
comes to accommodation. A very
large proportion of the average
student's budget goes directly into
paying accommodation expenses.
Rented accommodation is little more
than living in a long stay hotel. A t
the end of your stay y o u have
nothing to show for the rent paid.
The financial benefits of finding
low cost accommodation at the
present are large and, as has been
pointed out, will probably become
much larger in the future. If you
can; start buying your own home.
If you can't; read on!
There are really two main options
w h e n c o n s i d e r i n g l o w cost
accommodation. They are short-life
housing usually through housing
cooperatives and squatting. Rents
for short-life housing can be as low
as £10 per week. The cost of
squatting can vary tremendously
depending on a variety of factors but
the financial incentive is obvious. At
its best, squatting can provide an
extended p e r i o d of rent-free
accommodation. So what are the
drawbacks? We shall consider each
of the options i n turn.
Short-Life Housing
The term 'short-life housing' is used
to describe property which is being
b o r r o w e d for temporary
a c c o m m o d a t i o n . U s u a l l y the
properties involved are owned by
the local authority or another public
body. Often the local authority is in
the process of applying for planning
permission and it is either waiting
for this to be granted or it is waiting
for money to become available to
allow development to start. In the
meantime the property is lent to a
local h o u s i n g association or
cooperative to manage. These
IC Halls - amongst the most expensive in London
groups may also own permanent
housing stock that may be any size
from 1-2 houses to a few hundred
spread over several boroughs.
As its name suggests, short-life
housing is only available for a short
period, from as little as six months
to five years. However some short-
life properties do get extensions for
even longer. The conditions of lease
state that at the end of the agreed
life the property must be handed
back vacant, to the original owners.
In some cases, the owner can take
back the property earlier by giving
a months notice to the occupiers to
vacate. Fortunately most short-life
groups will do their best to re-house
you, should your house be taken
back.
Short-life h o u s i n g varies i n
standard but d o n ' t expect
conditions to be too good initially.
Depending on the short-life group
managing the property, repairs will
be made to make the house
adequate. Y o u will usually be
expected to decorate and furnish the
property yourself. O n the other
hand the rent is extremely l o w
varying between £10-£20 per week.
Westminster, one of the most
expensive boroughs, has short-life
property available between £15-25
per week.
' A Guide to Short-Life Housing in
London' is published by the E P U
(the Empty Property Unit, a national
advisory service for short-life
groups), price £1. It lists all major
short-life groups in London, and
gives a brief account of the present
situation in each London borough.
It is an essential aid to anyone
l o o k i n g for short-life
accommodation.
Several of the London colleges
have accommodation offices dealing
with short-life housing groups, but
as is the case at Imperial College,
spaces are l i m i t e d a n d so
applications are often restricted to
families, overseas students and
postgraduates, all of w h o m face
particular financial problems over
accommodation. A n exception is
Chelsea College, now part of Kings,
which has about 70 short-life
properties i n Kensington a n d
Chelsea and elsewhere, housing
about 200 students. They are in fact
the only short-life group in the
borough able to obtain property
from the local council. It is unlikely
that non-Kings College students
would be allowed to apply.
The main difficulty in short-life
housing is actually getting onto a
waiting list. Due to the housing
shortage and the many homeless
people in London, local authorities
are no longer releasing so many
properties to short-life housing
groups. Instead they are using them
for temporary accommodation to
fulfill their statutory requirements to
house the homeless, especially
homeless families. Consequently
many groups are running out of
new properties and have closed
their waiting lists. Instead they are
trying to re-house their existing
members. Those with waiting lists
still open are taking much smaller
numbers with the lists re-opening
irregularly.
When applying to get on a short-
life waiting list check that there are
no restrictions that will affect your
application. Many groups will only
deal with the homeless. Often you
will be given priority if you apply in
a b o r o u g h w h e r e y o u have
previously been resident. It is
sometimes a good idea to get onto
the local council waiting list for a
council house, before applying for
a short-life house. If possible put
your name on the local electoral
register. A connection with the area
which you apply for, such as a job,
relatives or the college where you
study can also help a successful
applicant.
Single people are easier to house
than groups. In general, if you apply
as a group then the best size is from
4-6, preferably mixed. Persistence
counts....
