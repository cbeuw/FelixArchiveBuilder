Poisoned planet?
Suddenly, everyone seems to be worried about the environment. The
perennial sixties worry about a nuclear holocaust has been replaced by
concerns about the slow poisioning of the planet. We face the certain
destruction of life on Earth within a century unless action is taken NOW.
Where once ecology meant saving little patches of picturesque countryside,
we now face a global problem rapidly advancing on several fronts.
Decades of disregard for the effects
of our civilisation upon the planet
have led to an accumulation of
pollution, now accelerating the
greenhouse effect, causing ozone
holes, acid rain, the poisoning of
rivers and seas, and the progressive
loss of fertile land. A s if this weren't
enough, our constant desire for
more living space means that
forests, a n d i n particular the
valuable tropical rainforests, are still
being destroyed at an alarming rate,
l e a d i n g to soil e r o s i o n ,
desertification, river silting, and
flooding. We are using u p the
Earth's natural resources as if there
were no tomorrow, burying the
waste, or dumping it at sea, hoping
it will go away.
A n y one of these factors, taken by
itself will radically alter the face of
the Earth within our litetimes. The
vast increase in Carbon Dioxide in
the atmosphere caused by burning
fossil fuels and abetted by the
destruction of the rain forests
prevents heat absorbed by the
atmosphere being reflected back
into space.
E v e n the most conservative
models of this 'Greenhouse' process
predict a global warming of around
three degrees within 50 years. That
may sound pleasant until y o u
consider what effect this will have.
The polar caps will recede and the
seas expand causing flooding of
most low land areas (that's all of
East Anglia, London and Holland).
At the same time the equatorial
regions will become uninhabitable
causing such a massive migration of
populations that war w i l l be
inevitable. (Imagine the entire
No wonder 'green' issues are set
to become the hottest political topic
of the next decade. A l l over the
world people are talking urgently
about protecting the environment.
However, global problems need
global solutions, and international
co-operation is vital. To restrict
further damage to the ozone layer,
every country must drastically cut
its production of chloro-fluoro-
carbons (CFCs) for use in aerosol
propellents.
What goes up must come down.
p o p u l a t i o n of Africa p o u r i n g
northwards into Europe). All within
our lifetimes.
So, this is all only conjecture, eh?
Wrong. It is happening now. The
recurring famines in Ethiopia are
man-made. So are the floods in
India. A l l these areas were once
covered in forest which regulated
the weather.
There is a widespread feeling that
the environment is someone else's
problem, but what is really needed
is for everyone to stop demanding
ever more comfortable lifestyles and
to start living in harmony with the
planet.
Our culture needs nothing short
of a r e v o l u t i o n i n attitudes.
Everyone must understand exactly
what irreplaceable resources they
are using up, how exactly things are
produced, and how pollution is
c a u s e d .
Every time y o u buy or use
something, ask yourself is it
necessary? Is it made f r o m
irreplaceable materials? Will you
make full use of it? When you
discard something, ask yourself if it
could be reused. Or, failing that,
recycled. C o u l d y o u use less
energy? After all, it's far easier to
conserve than to try and find clean
ways to produce ever more
e l e c t r i c i t y .
Once you have grasped these
basic changes in attitude, it's time
to inform those in power about how
you feel. In our democratic system,
politicians are only interested in
popularity and votes. Whilst they
believe that everyone wants a more
affluent society, and that everyone
wants to consume more, they will
continue to ignore long term
problems in favour of saving public
money and improving the economy.
A n y M P will tell you that there is
not enough money to do all that the
environmentalists d e m a n d as
necessary to safeguard the planet.
However, this is definately not true.
What they mean is that there is not
enough money left over after they
have satisfied other priorities, such
as stimulating economic growth,
and winning votes by reducing
taxes. Economic growth is only
necessary to continue improving the
standard of living if you assume that
the only way to improve your
standard of living is to have more
money to spend. This extra money
w i l l o n l y be spent o n more
consumer goods, accelerating the
