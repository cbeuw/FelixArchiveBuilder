use of non-renewable resources,
and the production of pollution.
I could cite that this government's
record o n pollution is the worst of
any i n Europe. 1 could go on about
how it is dragging its heels on every
E E C directive concerning the
environment. 1 could even point out
that the only reason the
Government has accepted that coal
fired power stations contribute to
acid rain is to further its war with
the mine workers n o w that the
economic arguments for nuclear
power have failed.
Instead 1 want to explode the
myth that market forces can regulate
pollution levels. I recently read a
note from a US colleague saying 'In
free society people will choose the
level of pollution they desire, and
regulate it, and the efficiency of the
free market will ensure the fastest
and most cost effective solution to
achieve those pollution levels'.
Unfortunately, this o p i n i o n ,
shared by the British government,
is dangerously complacent. A 'free'
society may try to choose the level
of pollution it desires, but several
factors make control impossible in
practice.
There is a delay between the use
of something and the evidence of
the pollution it causes. It takes time
for the p o l l u t i o n to cause
environmental damage. It takes
something like twenty years for the
CFCs produced at any point in time
to fully filter up to the ozone layer.
This means that even if we stop all
use of CFCs immediately, it may be
too late to prevent serious effects
over the next few decades.
Research into the environmental
effects of substances always lags
behind their exploitation. This is
exacerbated in society by the desire
to fully exploit the benefits (usually
financial) of use as fast as possible.
Occasionally this has even led to
falsification of laboratory reports,
w h i c h further delays proper
research into the effects.
Finally, there's the NIMBY (not in

quite happily control pollution of
their o w n areas, whilst exporting
pollution elsewhere.
In North America and Northern
Europe, acid rain is damaging
forests i n countries other than the
ones i n which the chemicals which
cause it originate. T h e usual
response of the government of the
producer country is to deny the
causal link, a n d delay proper
investigation, simply because it is
not under pressure from its o w n
citizens to do something about it.
Whilst a piecemeal approach can
tackle the most urgent problems
facing the planet, the key to long
term change is individual action
based o n a revolution i n attitudes.
Every person must understand his
or her impact o n the environment,
and adapt to reduce the detrimental
effects. Every one of us should think
about our lifestyles and consider
how to become less wasteful, less
polluting and less materialistic.

Scientists have spent a great deal of
time trying to understand exactly
why the great dinosaurs became
extinct a hundred-million years ago
but they are ignoring a problem of
even greater magnitude which is
occuring today.
Under the ice of Antactica is a
diversity of oil and minerals that
many countries are squabbling over.
In their greed, they are not willing
to spend money o n the
sophisticated research vital to
predict the results of such
exploitation o n the continent's
complex and fragile environment.
We know that about 90% of the
world's fresh water is contained in
the ice cap and that this ice plays an
important role i n global climates.
Dust from mining or an oil spill
(which in Antarctica is impossible to
clear up) lowers ice reflectance of the
sun a n d this imbalance could
change weather patterns and alter
sea levels to an extent that would
threaten global cities worldwide.
It has been estimated that an
accident in which one tanker cargo
spilt in the Ross Sea would affect
one million square kilometres of
ocean.
A large oil leakage would have
disasterous effects on the declining
whale population of the Antartic. In
1981 scientists from the International
Whaling Commission reported that
whaling had reduced Bluw Whales
to less than 5 % of their original
population and humpback whales
to 3%; the few remaining great
whales would easily be killed by the
interference of an oil slick with their
feeding, breathing, migration and
communication methods.
There would also be drastic
consequences for shore breeding
birds and seals. They inhabit scarce
ice-free coastal regions and already
many breeding sites have been lost
to scientific research stations.
Not only d o these stations
encroach on important habitats but
they pollute the sea by pumping
waste directly into it. Indeed at one
site many tonnes of earth had to be
excavated after a nuclear reactor
leakage. This conflict between
science and the ecosystem will only
increase if oil companies are allowed
use of the shoreline.
Unless immediate steps are taken
to control actions i n Antartica we
will not only destroy a beautiful and
isolated continent but we will
jeopardize the whole of human
civilisation.
