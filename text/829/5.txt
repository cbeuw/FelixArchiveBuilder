Opinion
bring 200 students across the park
in a concerted attempt to change
ICU policy. I salute the 300 IC
students who, perhaps foreseeing
this or merely concerened about the
danger of the proposed changes,
turned up en masse, stayed through
tedious debate over affairs in which
they had little interest, and put a
stop to the attempt to restrict their
right of democracy.
I fear this is not the end. The
U n i v e r s i t y Grants C o m m i t t e e
(UGC) have set a deadline of four
years from now for the new Imperial
College to become completely
integrated at every level financially.
The 'informal working group'
which proposed the abolition of
U G M s are working under pressure
to get the two Unions merged
quickly and this, I fear, is bringing
far too many concessions from the
IC side.
St Mary's have a definite fixed
identity, a strong and deliberately
maintained independence which
they will not wish to part with.
Imperial College Union is a much
larger body. We have 5000 students
to represent, most of which are
scientists or engineers. We have a
solid identity a n d a fierce
independence.
Should we really be giving so
many concessions to S M H M S S U
during the merger negotiations?
They may be determined that their
independence should not be lost,
fair enough. But the body that
represents 5000 students should not
be falling over to give everything we
prize about the Union away (a free
media, a democratically elected,
accountable a n d dismissable
leadership, the right of any member
of the Union to have their say in an
open regular meeting about the
direction i n which we should be
heading) just for the sake of 500
students.
Let S M H M S S U merge with us if
they want to, but under our terms.
South Kensington, with ten times
the population, has to dominate.
Demands for a third of the seats on
Council, the restriction of FELIX,
half the U G M s to be held i n
P a d d i n g t o n ; these s h o u l d be
laughed at. If they don't want to join
us then let them come begging for
a grant to U F C every year, give
them two (at the most) delegates to
U L U , then send them packing
across the park. This is democracy,
we are the majority and we will not
be dictated to.
Palestine strikes back!

Dear Bill,
I've just managed to find a safe
hide-out, so I thought I'd write a
note to tell you what I've been up
to for the past few weeks. Someone
called in the rat-catchers, so a low
profile has been essential. The safest
place to hide is STOIC, especially
now that their camera has been
stolen leaving them with a Kodak
Brownie. This does not mean that
they have been idle; on the contrary,
they seem to have found a brand
new image for STOIC as can be seen
from the following events (which
never happened).
Two shadowy figures i n dirty
raincoats and dark glasses sneak up
the stairs to the STOIC studio and,
looking over their shoulders, knock
on the door. The first figure stands
like a man that screws a lot of
nurses, and the second looks like
Chas Brereton, U n i o n Deputy
President. Both look very nervous.
"I want to see the Boss," said the
nurse-molester. " W h o is it?" asked
a gruff voice from within. "It's the
Blue Movie Brothers."
A random menial opens the door
and leads the Blue Movie Brothers
to a room overflowing with wires
and uselessly expensive equipment.
In the middle of the room sits an
amorphous figure with a pimp's hat
and crocodile boots - it's Johnny D.,
the Boss. " H a v e you got the stuff?"
"Yeah, six hours of sizzling, sticky
s t i m u l a t i o n . S l i p p e r y S u s a n
simpering slurpily..." " W e ' l l take
it!" snaps the figure who looked like
Chas Brereton, U n i o n Deputy
President. The Dynamic Duo grab
the goods and hurry off to a grimy
room in Beit Hall to study Slippery
Susan.
C h a s seems to be a little
disoriented by the things he's been
seeing o n the television. A n
enterprising student h a d the
misfortune to fling himself from the
Aero building and came up against
the age-old enemy of flight, the
ground, and was i n need of an
ambulance. Chas, stirred by the
commotion from his devotions i n
his "bedroom", rushed to the scene
and started putting change in the
meter next to the ambulance. A l l the
time he muttered under his breath
"Susan, o h S u s a n . . . " People like
Chas need to go to places like the
Medical Centre where doctors
understand their problems. EEEK!
The rat-catchers have found me.
Must scuttle.
All my Love,
Norman (The Ex-Union Rat)

No Thanks
by Neil Motteram
One of the most telling things said
at the Union General Meeting on
January 31 was by Phil Drew,
President of St Mary's Union,
during the count of the U G M
abolition vote. U G M Chairman
Dave Burns asked if M r Drew would
like to make a report '...because
you're part of us now'. The reply
was 'Mary's don't like IC U G M s ' .
Mary's don't like IC U G M s . They
object to our method of self-
government so much that when
they had the opportunity to get it
removed and power shifted up the
ladder to a C o u n c i l w i t h a
disproportionate weighting i n
favour of Mary's, they were willing
to cancel afternoon lectures and
In the land of Palestine, a new state
was created i n 1948. Most of the
original inhabitants were expelled.
Their country and their lands had
been usurped by an alien people. It
is these facts which have created the
Palestine question.
The unique nature of the Arab-
Israeli conflict, its aggravation by
five wars and its complication by the
interests and ambitions of the great
powers, have made the Palestine
question one of the most explosive
in the world today. Five wars have
already occurred between the Arabs
and the Israelis a n d hostilities
continue despite the Armistice
agreements of 1949 and the Security
Council's cease-fire orders of 1967,
with no end or peace yet in sight.
The first step towards peace is to
remove the smoke-screen that has
been laid by Zionist propoganda,
and to lay bare the injustice to the
people of Palestine which is at the
root of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Without an understanding of the
essence of the conflict, world public
opinion will remain i n ignorance
and will continue to extend its
sympathy and support to Israel
which has caused so much havoc
and destruction in the Middle Eas..
Contrary to Israel's expectations,
the war which it launched on June
5th 1967 did not solve the problems
they created nor did it enable it to
impose its ' d i k t a t ' u p o n the
Palestinians b y o c c u p y i n g
approximately 20% of Palestine they
had not yet seized. In fact, the
n u m e r o u s Israeli oppressions
released the Palestinian forces of
resistance w h i c h h a d been
contained by illusions in the U N and
its resolutions. The power of the
Israeli army (very heavily funded by
the US) ruled in all conflicts and the
Palestinians come to realise that
even in our era of civilisation what
is lost by force can be regained only
by force. But the force that the
Palestinians want to exert upon
Israel is not that of sophisticated
aircraft, missiles, chemical a n d
nuclear weapons (which Israel
possesses, unlike the Palestinians),
but that of negotiation. That is the
one w e a p o n that the Israeli
government is the most frightened
of, because it is concerned with talk
of 'human rights' and 'international
l a w s ' , w h i c h Israel o p e n l y
contravened and still contravenes.
The sole a n d legitimate
representative of the Palestinians,
the P L O , wants the Palestinians to
have their human rights back,
including self-determination, and
the right of expelled refugees to
return to their motherland. Such an
initiative is possible i n t h e
framework of a n international
conference on Middle East peace in
order for the outcome to be
i m p l e m e n t e d u n d e r U N
supervision.
AH who care for peace, justice and
human rights, and also the future of
the Jewish people, must hope that
Zionism, with its connotations to
racism, gives way to a wiser and
more human view of the indigenous
inhabitants of Palestine: the
Palestinian people.
