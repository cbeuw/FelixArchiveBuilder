A life in the city
The alternative guide
to finding somewhere
to live in London.
Students in London already face a
severe accommodation problem,
and it's going to get worse. This
article is intended to inform and
motivate anyone currently looking
for accommodation, when faced
with high rents and poor conditions,
to think about the alternatives. It
provides a guide to the main options
available, short-life housing i n
housing cooperatives and squatting,
and attempts to assess their relative
advantages and disadvantages over
normal rented accommodation.

London is still available, it's just a
matter of getting informed and
organised. The financial savings
possible should provide enough
m o t i v a t i o n to overcome the
difficulties involved. *
Rented a c c o m m o d a t i o n i n
London is, as everyone knows,
expensive in comparison to the rest
of the country. M o s t L o n d o n
students are i n rented
accommodation. A typical rent for
a single room will be £45 per week.
Whilst rented accommodation for
£30 per week is still available, this
is generally for shared rooms or
accommodation in the outer London
boroughs where money saved in
rent is lost again due to high
commuting costs. A look at the
present a c c o m m o d a t i o n lists
(January 1989) from the Imperial
College Accommodation Office
confirms this price range.
At the moment students are
entitled to H o u s i n g Benefit.
However, the system is notoriously
unreliable and complicated. The
recent amendments alone amount
to thirty pages of A 4 size diagrams.
Payments are often delayed and the
final sum given appears to be
decided more on how generous the
local authority is rather than any
actual financial considerations. The
Housing Benefit system can also
create a poverty trap, where the
student is unable to earn money as
this might lead to a reduction of the
benefit given. There have even been
cases where not only has the benefit
been stopped but the student has
been asked to pay back that already
received.

You can find shared accommodation for £30 per week
despite all its faults, does provide an
essential subsidy to the cost of
rented accommodation. In some
cases this can amount to £20 per
week or more. With Housing
Benefit considered, rented
accommodation is still cheaper than
the limited College and inter-
collegiate hall accommodation
available in London. (Incidentally
Imperial College halls are some of
the most expensive in London, rents
being set near the maximum that the
students will tolerate.)
Although the financial cost of
being a student in London is high
already, very soon it may get a lot
worse. In the near future several
factors may come together to make
studying in L o n d o n extremely
difficult financially. These factors
include the introduction of the Poll
Tax, the changes in the grant system
in the Government's white paper
'Top-up loans for students' and
changes in the Housing Benefit
system.
Briefly these proposals are still in
the planning stage so it is possible
that they will never be put into
action or if they are, then in a
diluted form. However, at the
moment it is proposed that students
will have to pay 20% of the Poll Tax
w h e n it is i n t r o d u c e d .
Simultaneously the White Paper
proposes that the level of grant and
parental contribution be frozen from
1990 onwards whilst at the same
time removing students from the
benefit system so that they are no
longer able to claim H o u s i n g
Benefit, Income S u p p o r t or
Unemployment Benefit during the
Summer Vacation.
The changes to Housing Benefit,
in itself, are a serious threat. They
are contained in a separate White
Paper from 1985. It is now very
likely Housing Benefit will be
stopped for students in 1990. What
will replace it, if anything, remains
to be- seen but it is hardly likely to
be an improvement.
Other important changes have
already taken place, although their
effects have not yet been felt fully.
U n t i l recently most students
received their parental contribution
in the form of a covenant for which
they could claim tax back. N o w this
is no longer possible following
changes in the law.
A n extremely important change
affecting rented accommodation has
come into effect just last month
(January 1989), with very little
publicity. The Government has de-
regulated rent, thus relaxing its
controls on rent increases. The
Imperial's Fremantle Hotel is rumoured to have been
burned down for insurance reasons.
