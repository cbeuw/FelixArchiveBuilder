Felix
Editorial
The mysterious disappearance of the Students Against Loans (SAL)
publicity from around College over the past two weeks has aroused
a good deal of speculation within the FELIX office. After much
deliberation, deduction and elimination, we were able to attribute
the following explanations...
1. SAL were using a cheap brand of blu-tak.
2. The posters were printed on rapidly bio-degradable paper.
3. They were printed in invisible ink.
4. The Physics department suffers from powerful and unexpected gusts
of wind.
Imagine our surprise when we discovered that the posters had been
deliberately taken down by a member of that fine and upstanding group
of individuals, the IC Conservative Society.
Sabbatical Elections
The Hustings UGM will take place next Thursday in the Great Hall. There
you will have a chance to listen to and ask questions of this year's
Sabbatical candidates.
Do not underestimate the importance of electing the right candidates
for the posts. In the past the College has shown no reluctance to walk
all over weak sabbatical officers, as those who remember the College's
manoevrings to build the QT burger bar in the Union's JCR, will testify.
Boring but true
Next week's FELIX is the manifestos issue. Manifestos should be submitted
by Monday at 10.00am accompanied by a photograph if required. Late
manifestos will not be accepted. Manifestos should be a maximum of 300
words including names and titles; overlong manifestos will be cut at the
300th word. Candidates will not be allowed to proof read their own
manifestos but members of FELIX staff will ensure they are printed exactly
as written.
Broken nose
If any more rude, arrogant, obnoxious prats from Dramsoc call into the
office on a weekend and insist that I drop everything immediately to
photocopy a script for them I will probably fly off the handle and give them
a broken nose. The same can be said for those people who come into the
office insisting that I print their small ads, letters, or complain when when
their badly written articles are edited.
Let me point out - for the last time - that the job of an editor is to edit.
Writing a letter into FELIX does not guarantee that it will be printed or
edited to fit the space on the letters page. Similarly, given that we can
only print a finite number of pages each week, although I try my best,
I cannot guarantee that articles or clubs advertisments will appear in a
given issue. Frequently lack of space means that articles have to be cut
or carried over to another issue.
In this respect, FELIX policy is no different from any national newspaper.
