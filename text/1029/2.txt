AGM Angst and Antics
B Y T H E NEWS T E A M
The success of today's Annual
General M e e t i n g ( A G M ) of
Imperial College Union, which
will be held this lunchtime in the
Ents Lounge, is in doubt.
A candidate for one of the
U n i o n posts has forged a
seconder's signature. F E L I X has
learnt that the supposed seconder
has not even heard of the pro-
posed candidate. The impers-
onated engineering student has
suggested that the candidate
must have been "smoking too
much dope, maybe off his head."
He further added that this sort of
activity "makes a mockery of the
whole election."
R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of
Imperial College, has predicted
that IC w i l l soon be forced to
charge undergraduates.
Speaking at a lecture last
Monday on the role of Imperial
in the future of H i g h e r
Education, the Rector refused to
give an exact time-scale, but
suggested that top-up fees could
be introduced by the turn of the
century. "It will not be in the
immediate future, and we will
not be alone," he said. As a
member of the Russell Group of
top universities, which includes
Oxford, Cambridge and the L S E ,
Sir Ronald is believed to have
previously considered the intro-
duction of top-up fees to boost
their falling budgets.
He emphasised the import-
ance of College developing a
more flexible approach to
teaching, as well as finding a way
to be more economical. H i g h -
lighting the need for the College
to vigorously defend its approach
to undergraduate teaching, he
said that " i f we plan without
recognising that our position in
the world has changed, we could
make some very bad decisions."
Sir Ronald expressed
concern that the older, elite
universities, will lose out in the
It is not clear whether in fact
the nominee is a 'joke candidate',
as by Wednesday night he had
only managed to find four
seconders. The validity of the
whole meeting is being ques-
tioned as two hundred people are
needed for the A G M elections to
be legitimate.
The meeting, which is
scheduled for today at 1pm in the
U n i o n Lounge, has further
suffered from a lack of publicity.
Last week's advertisement in
F E L I X gave neither a date nor a
time and posters did not appear
around college until yesterday
morning. T h i s has been cont-
rasted with the wide publicity
given by the Union to encourage
'dramatic changes' which are
happening to higher education.
He was critical of much of the
present university environment,
describing the highly influential
H i g h e r Education F u n d i n g
Council for England as being 'at
times hostile and threatening'.
The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principles
( C V C P ) , which attempts to
represent all higher education
heads, had 'shifted away from the
k i n d of things we do and the
kind of values we cherish'.
The wide ranging talk
discussed the changing relation-
ships between teaching, research
and industry in the light of the
students to vote in the recent
NUS referendum.
Today's gathering is to elect
eight new Union officers and to
ratify the election of next year's
sabbaticals. In addition, this
year's officers are likely to be
questioned over their annual
reports.
The only contest in the
elections is likely to be that for
the powerful job of C o u n c i l
Chair. As F E L I X went to press
the only declared candidate was
Vinnie Fernandez, Royal School
of Mines Union President, but
sources insist that Charlie Bell,
Royal College of Science Union
President, had previously
planned to stand.

recent expansion i n student
numbers. He was particularly
enthusiastic about the idea of
continuing education. T h i s
would encourage graduates to
return to university during their
working careers for retraining
increasing interaction between
higher education and industry.
The Rector highlighted the
striking changes seen in the level
of student finance, showing
figures which indicate that by the
end of the century funding per
student will have halved from
1980 levels. Sir R o n a l d is
believed to personally prefer the
option of graduate tax over top-
up fees.

the Asia Pacific region." World
Scientific Publishing is the only
sizeable publishing group based
in that area of the world.
ICP's Editorial Advisory
Board is chaired by Lord George
Porter, N o b e l Laureate and
Professor at Imperial College's
Department of Chemistry. It is
suggested that they w i l l
approach past students and
academics first, but will also look
to publish works from outside
the College. World Scientific
w i l l lend sales, marking and
distribution skills, as well as
actually producing the books and
journals.
Speaking to F E L I X , Tony
Moore of ICP suggested that the
extra impetus to launch a
publishing concern might be due
to Imperial's emerging status as
a medical institution. It is
thought that Imperial College
Press will publish extensively in
this field, as well as in science
and technology.
M r M o o r e stressed the
importance the emergence of
electronic formats, saying: "it is
recognised that is the way
science publishing will move - it
is a matter of sooner or later."
Loweth
to Go
B Y T H E N E W S T E A M
The main Imperial College
repair and maintenance contrac-
tors, Loweth and Company, look
set to lose their IC work. Their
agreement comes up for review
this July. Last year the company
was reappointed after an annual
assessment, but with their
quality of work being questio-
ned, the contract is once again
going out to tender.
Ron Jeeves, College's
Operations Manager, has said
that it is 'likely that we will not
employ them' after the current
tendering procedure. W h i l e
emphasising that the re-
tendering is 'part of the natural
process' he later admitted that 'it
is almost certain' that another
company w i l l take over the
contract.
