Voices out of the air: the radio centenary
UNWIRED FOR SOUND
RADIO BAUDCAST
2
0 YEARS OF IC RADIO
One hundred years ago this year, a twenty-one year old Italian
invented the first practical wireless telegraph set. The following year
Guglielmo Marconi patented his invention i n England - the Italian
authorities having rejected his proposal - and radio was born.
Ten years elapsed before the first transmission of speech, and i n
the same month that the B B C began broadcasting, K i n g George V
delivered his Christmas Day message by radio, addressing "men and women so cut
off by the snows and the deserts that only voices out of the air can reach them".
Today, the B B C W o r l d Service reaches 130 million listeners world wide.
Radio saturates the airwaves: what's the next step? This week i n the S-files, we
ponder two developments. In last Monday's Guardian newspaper, Kevin Kelly
(Editor of Wired magazine and acclaimed, yet not over-exposed, guru) compared
society's resistance to early radio with current resistance to the Internet: "Early
radio was too hard to use, and there was nothing to listen to, just radio enthusiasts
talking to each other. In the beginning it wasn't thought of as a communications
device at a l l . These things
aren't always obvious."
But the Internet is leading
radio i n a different area. The
huge amount of information on
the Internet means that an
automatic scanning programme
which selects items of interest
and ignores the rest has already
been developed. N i c h o l a s
Negroponte of M I T saw the
Same development ahead for Happy to be the only student radio station in London
radio when interviewed on The Network, a B B C Radio 4 programme: "The big
difference is that information can now be processed at the receiving end. I think
that radio in fact will be where most of the innovation takes place. It can listen to 5
- 10,000 hours or radio on your behalf and record little chunks for you. It's already
much more digital than the video world; eventually I think that car radios and
home radios won't have an on-off switch any more."
On the right, hear what Dave Cohen, former IC Radio Station manager has to
say about our very own 20-year-old station. A n d below, check out the emerging
overlap between Radio and the Net. Bizarre! S-files

j S-files spoke to Dave Cohen,
| IC Radio Station manager 1992-93:
"The Radio station was set up in about
|1975, but it didn't get its first broadcast
\ licence until March of 1976. It's still the
| only broadcasting student radio station in London.
i.
I One of the first songs they played was Elton John's
I Crocodile Rock and so the crocodile became the station's
i mascot. I think the actual crocodile got thrown away, but
Uohn Allen, the first Station manager (who is now
j controller of LBC) returns every year for the Croc Club
I dinner when old members get together.
It's true that we're still broadcasting on leaky coaxial
cable, 19 years after opening. To go FM would mean we
would have to contend with other local stations like
Capital FM, though. We might be able to get a temporary
FM licence, but they cost a lot of money, and we'd need a
transmitter which would also be expensive.
If IC Radio was run by a sabbatical, more time could
be spent on broadening the listenership by increasing
fundraising efforts to pay for things like transmitters, and
devoting more time to organising shows and training
people.
I The problem is that the listenership is restricted to |
Southside and so advertisers aren't interested. But until
j funds are raised, we can't increase the audience. If one
| year the distribution was increased, by laying landlines
\ over to the Union bars, the college common rooms and all
I the halls of residence, or better still by obtaining a wide
[area broadcast licence, a large part of the problem would
|be solved. After that the Station Manager could
I concentrate on programming.
At the moment IC Radio is very important because it
provides a unique opportunity for students to have a go at
| radio broadcasting, not to mention being excellent fun. Its
f significance would further increase as a college-wide
1 source of information and entertainment if its profile was
raised and these changes took place."
