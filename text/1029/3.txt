News In Brief
Exam Traumas
Second and T h i r d Year
Mathematics students were
disrupted during their exams last
Tuesday as a fire broke out in the
basement of the Huxley building.
D r D a v i d Herbert, the
department's Senior Tutor, has
insisted that students were only
out of the exam rooms for 'two
or three minutes.' The small fire
was put out by Maths' Safety
Officer, Geoff Reason, and
students were given an extra 15
minutes at the end of the exam to
make up for the distraction.
Vernon M c L u r e , the
Academic Registrar, has sug-
gested that the Board of
Examiners w i l l be advised to
make allowance for students
losing train of thought during
the interruption. He discounted
suggestions that the examination
would have to be rerun saying
that unless there had been a
major breach of rules the
majority would "rather get on
and get over with it".
Pub Watching!
The rising number of drunken
incidents ( F E L I X 1005-1028)
affecting Imperial College is
being tackled by local police and
college drinking establishments
with a new scheme called 'Pub
Watch'. At present an anomaly
exists whereby students banned
from one establishment, for
instance the Union Bar, can still
drink in either the Holland Club
or Southside.
Security Control in Sherfield
w i l l coordinate a programme
whereby descriptions of banned
students will be posted in each
bar. P C Clive Coleman suggests
that as offensive activity in any of
the campus bars would force
students to drink outside college
(and hence pay higher prices)
student behaviour should
improve. The 'Queens Arms' is
involved in the scheme and Clive
hopes that other local hostelries
could soon also be included in
the initiative.
Even people who look
suspicious could be included, as
P C Coleman points out that
licensees do not actually need a
reason to bar prospective
drinkers. The police hope to have
the scheme 'up and running
pretty soon'.
Pimlico Safe
Questions over the future of the
P i m l i c o Connection tutoring
scheme, raised i n the Times
Higher Educational Supplement
earlier this month, have been
quashed by D r Sinclair Goodlad.
The Head of the Humanities
Department dismissed the
paper's announcement that 'the
Imperial scheme may be for the
chop'. Financing for the prog-
ramme has been guaranteed for
the next five years.
Top Gear Stalled
Last Friday's Top Gear feature -
due to show Imperial engineers
in a kit car building race - was
cancelled at the last minute. The
presenter booked to do the
voiceover wasn't available. B B C
sources have suggested that the
event's screening has been post-
poned until next autumn's series
of the popular programme.
Briley's Rogues Gallery
Terry Briley, Deputy Head of
Security, is planning to set up a
'rogue's gallery' of Imperial
criminals. Armed with a new
Polaroid camera, he intends to
record suspicious incidents and
college intruders so that repeat
offenders can be easily identified.
Mr Briley also intends to extend
the plan to include cooperation
with other L o n d o n Colleges.
"People make a l i v i n g out of
doing over Universities," he said.
The plan is part of the
continuing security clampdown
on the ever-growing college
crime problem. Speaking to
F E L I X , P C Clive Coleman said
that over 50% of crimes in the
Belgravia sector, which includes
Knightsbridge, occurred at
Imperial. Recent incidents
include a break i n at D r
Learner's flat in Princes Gardens,
after which a man was chased by
College Security but lost i n
Exhibition Road.
Input Rejected
Imperial College Estates look set
to go ahead with their Strategy
Review without encouraging
students to comment upon the
proposals. L e a d i n g up to the
publication of a final strategy in
June, the review was issued to
college staff i n M a r c h . It
discusses the development of
student accommodation and the
future of the whole of IC's estate.
Whilst the College claims to
have a policy of openness, M r Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates, has
declined to give F E L I X a copy
of the report. It is suggested that
he would prefer that students
commented on the final strategy
rather than misinterpreted the
initial document. In the light of
this decision, college staff will be
able to influence the plans but
students w i l l not be able to
discuss the proposals, only
merely reflect upon the final con-
clusions.
A friend returned from a jealousy
provoking trip to South, and
then North, America earlier this
week. W h i l s t she portrays
rainforests i n the 'get there
before they're gone' manner I'd
have expected, her reaction to the
States is more of a surprise. She
describes dead suburban towns
crawling with Beavis and
Butthead stereotypes and of the
fear of walking at night - and
these were college towns!
Although this is an almost
cliched view of America, for me
it gained an added poignancy
thanks to her delivery. She is
usually unbearably optimistic
about places and people, and in
America only the madness of
New York seemed to her real.
I mention it because I find it
fascinating that there is a country
behind the gore-bytes we read
and hear. The first three things
that spring to my mind if I think
of the U S are the OJ Simpson
trial, the recent Oklahoma
bombing and a trashy story about
a chat show involving a woman
who slept with 251 men i n ten
hours - filmed, the video is
available for purchase. One's
initial thought is that this is just
tabloid sensationalism but with
years of repeated doses, hypo-
chondria gives way to disease.
Recently there has been
much debate over arming the
police. Too often America is
brought up as an example of a
tough police force - even though
everybody knows about the
murder counts and gun law.
Maybe we're subconsciously
motivated by the comforting
thought of Cagney and Lacey
pulling a gun on the streets of
L o n d o n , maybe scared of
seemingly increasing crime we'd
like to feel safer. The problem is
that it is so difficult to determine
whether crime is actually on the
increase. Detection rates, changes
in the definition of laws, changes
in those you consider covered by
the law (it's only i n the last
hundred years that people have
really expected the poor to be
anything other than criminal:
witness the illegality of poverty
in centuries past). A l l can
confuse the picture.
The growing power of the
media as the only voice of
'authority' has also, I'm sure,
contributed to this perspect-
iveless 'bloodbath'. Even here we
suffer Crimewatch U K and a
barrage of lurid news reports. So
it surprises people that the most
gruesome k i l l i n g of Police
Officers happened in the sixties.
The media has a fundamental
desire to show the world as a bad
place, in order to sell product.
The scary t h i n g about
America is it seems to be true!
