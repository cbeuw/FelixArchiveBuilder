Wot no Frater?... Questionnaire Plug... The Sex War on Wheels Edited this week by Owain
Prater's Fan
Dear Felix,
I am distressed to see that our
good Frater, no doubt lost in
meditation and removed from
concerns of the temporal realms
has ceased to offer words of
Wisdom and Comfort to his
followers.
Thus I am bidding him
continue, for a slightly deranged
PG student is finding it increasingly
difficult to find solace from
meetings with the Supervisor,
without Frater Fiam's weekly poetic
discourse.
Yours etc.

My recollection of the Frater's last
article was that it was very much a
farewell piece. He has hung up his
hat in recognition of the futility of
his original question, not to
mention the infinite and reflexive
nature of the answer he sought. Or
maybe he died, suffering horribly in
a car crash. Something like that.
Sort out ICTJ
Dear Owain,
I know most of our students must
be sick of answering questions at
the moment, but this is a quick
reminder about the ICU
questionnaire.
As a Student Union, it is
important for us to know what
students think of us now, and what
they'd like us to do in the future.
Basically, if we know what you
want, we might be able to do
something about it.
So, if you've got an opinion,
pick up a questionnaire from: The
Union Office, Bookstore, STA
Student Travel or Da Vinci's and
then return it to us. Oh, and to
encourage you, STA travel have
given us Â£150 work of travel
vouchers to give to the person who
fills in the first questionnaire we
pull out of the hat on June 16th.
Your opinion matters, so tell us
what you think.
Best wishes,

Sex Change
Dear Felix,
I decided to write this piece as a
result of a culmination of thoughts
over a series of events. For a start,
I am female. I state this because
for 2 hours of sitting next to a
Frenchman on a bus I was
mistaken for a male despite
conversation being continuous
though maybe a little one sided-
he did most of it. Various gestures
forced me to this conclusion. Firstly
he nudge- nudge wink winked at
two girls sitting next to Us, who
tittered and glanced slyly sideways.
"Strangely" enough I failed to
respond I Secondly since it
emerged during the course of the
conversation that I had just been
to visit my female French
exchange, he asked whether she
was my girlfriend. I thought this
just a little bit forward. I think that
unless you feel very comfortable
with the idea of homosexuality it is
not a question generally asked.
However you never can tell, so I
decided not to comment. Further
mild astonishment ensued when
he asked whether I thought my
French exchange was pretty!!
Thirdly he explained the meanings
of some less than polite French
words, which in my opinion would
not have happened had he known
the truth! Other gestures followed!
Accustomed as I was (and am) to
being a girl it was not until
journey's end that I realised what
must have occurred. I decided not
to embarrass the poor man with
enlightenment and grabbed my
back pack off the front seat with
what I thought was a manly show
of strengthl So that's how one guy
behaves when he meets another.
Interesting! (or was the whole
thing done on purpose and really I
was the one who was fooled?)
This brings me to the second
event, the much publicised
Southside Incident and the even
more publicised Oxford University
bridge jumper and the difference
in attitude to males and female
exposure. Many people regarded
the former as a good laugh though
there was outrage and pity as well.
Would the reaction have been the
same had the three participants
been girls. From the reaction to the
Oxford girl, I doubt it. When
women expose their natural
endowments they are more often
than not regarded as cheapening
themselves- which is what the
Oxford girl has done particularly
by posing for the Sun. It's hard
enough for women to get taken
seriously in higher education
establishments and professions as
it is and unfair as it is. After all we
don't see a male page three! Nor
have the three Southside
participants jeopardised
themselves.
Finally, perhaps the difference
in reactions is slightly related to
the two terms macho and girlie.
The former though intellectually
rejected (it is after all not in
harmony with the new man
image!) is still I suspect secretly
thought complimentary. Being
called a "girlie" by anyone, male
or female is never complimentary.
Yours Sincerely,
Ida Lister
