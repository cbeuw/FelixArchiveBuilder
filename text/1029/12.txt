"There is no art in these songs, they
drive themselves, become exacty
thier limits and possibilities" scrawl
pavement (sans dictionary) inside
their new album, wowee zowee.
Which is what we've come to
expect from the kings of diy
american music; something that
initially seems so throwaway and
stupid, that on reflection actually
encapsulates some deep seated
truth. Remember 'cut your hair'
from their last album, crooked rain,
crooked rain'?; "music scene's
crazy, bands start up each and every
day. I saw another one just the
other day, a special new band". It's
all there; the inane, the vain and
the glorious sides of life. And in the
same way, Pavement are probably
the only band in the world who
could label an album 'wowee
zowee, whilst keeping their smiles
akimbo and turning out songs as
great and meaningful as 'rattled by
the rush' and 'fight this generation'.
"Teenage angst has paid off
well and now I'm bored and old"
were the first words growled by Kurt
on his last studio album. "There is
no castration feai" chimes back
Stephen J. MalkmujrWrf^H||Br 'we
dance'. Maybe it's supposed to be
significant but more probably
Pavement are just out baiting the
open mouths of the press legions
again. After the fun they've had
bad-breathing the Smashing
Pumpkins and Stc|JBT||riple Pilots
in the past, wh i them the
opportunity. Still it would be more
than a shame if tWOBw of rumpus
overshadowed iiance of
'wowee zowee'.
Whereas, 'crooked roin, crook-
ed rain', was to I for some,

Their trick is that although
songs like 'best friends arm' and
'brinx job' veer close together, they
remain distinct. Partly it's because
Pavement ignore the traditional
niceties of verse-chorus-verse and
so they can crash out, kick in
overdrive guitars or even the odd
harmonica to redirect the melody
wherever they change their mind.
Partly it's the simple fact that
Pavement are one of the best bands
playing around today But whatever
the reasoning behind it, all you
need are the ears to hear it.
Pavement ore inane, vain, glorious,

There's a bit of run on Mr Depp this week folks. Magpie

'Summertime, and the living is easy' so the song goes. But
it's not the case for dedicated followers of fashion says
Fiona. Attention to detail is the order of the season.

Overall this isn't a terrible
album but I d only buy it if I was a
big fan. It would probably be better
- their last two singles. (6)
So kingmaker are back with
in the best possible taste, their fourth
album, and they've even had a hit
single to boot. This, despite being at
the end of more than one waspish
tongue from the hack pack. And
this overpraised F E L I X
whilst it's easy to pick on their 'A'
level politics (some of Loz's lyrics
still fall wide of the mark), on the
whole 'in the best possible taste' is
an accomplished album, with more
good than average.
Produced by Stephen Street (of
Morrissey fame) the end result is a
fuller and not so 'much in your face'

iHCordings. Whilst the single, 'you

emotive songs ore hard to come by
in these days of floppy fringes and
vacuous, pseudo-intellectual
proverbs. All of these are necessary
components of the live acoustic Ip,

"Robert Plant said to me, 'Frankie,
you'll never do anything new in rock
'n'roll'. Well I ain't ever seen Planty
make a cup of tea on stage."

Sunset Boulevard stone drunk

Then one day I woke up and
realised that I was one of them."

previous stuff I could bandy about
words like 'indie', 'rock,, goth' and
'punk' but none would even come
close - influences merge and come
together with no hint of pretention
sound effects and slightly twisted
vocals merge to form the most
original thing I've heard since the
last Wildhearts' album. Song titles
like 'ode to drink' and sicky vomit
don't do justice to the delicacy of
the introspective, often sexual,
lyrics. And for onco I totally forgot
that they're an all-girl band I am
impressed, way above average (9)©
