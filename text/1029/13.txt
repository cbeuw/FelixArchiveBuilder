There he stands claiming to be Don
Juan and only forty feet from death,
d o n juan de m a r c o (Johnny
Depp), the world's greatest lover
and seducer of more than one
thousand women, looks over the
window ledge, suicidal with the loss
of his only one true love. Dr Mickler
(Mar/on Brando) is called by the
police to talk the jumper down and
there he finds the young man
dressed in a cape, a Zorro mask
and wielding a sword.
Don Juan, now in a mental
institution, starts to retell his life's
story of love and romance. With
each session Dr Mickler becomes
more engrossed by the young
man's stories and slowly begins to
believe he really is Don Juan De
Marco. Don Juan's influence is
evident and his love of love rubs off
on the doctor who starts to rekindle
the flame with his own wife Marilyn
(Faye Dunaway). However with only
ten days to decide whether or not
Don Juan should be institutionalised
permanently, Dr Mickler has to
persuade him to 'drop this facade'.
Don Juan's tales are certainly
tall, like hiding in an arabian harem
with 1,500 women, but as the film
progresses you end up wanting to
believe in this fantasy world to
escape from the dreariness of the
everyday life. It's becomes a
question Dr Mickler has to face; is
the reality of his life more desirable
than this fantasy world?
The film's passion is addictive
and this is what makes it so
enjoyable. It's feelings of love,
passion and romance will linger
long after the tale is ended.
Having passed up directing
Batman Forever, Tim Burton
concentrates his unique macabre
visual and directing styles on the
story of Edward D. Wood Jnr. This
infamous cross-dressing director
was recently voted 'worst director of
all time' thanks to such Z-grade
movies as Bride of the Atom and
Plan 9 from Outer Space.
ed wood focuses on Wood's
(Johnny Depp) struggle in
Hollywood to make his films whilst
juggling his personal life and in
particular his secret passion for
dressing in women's clothing. The
film also deals with Wood's
friendship with the washed-up,
morphine addicted former movie
star Bela Lugosi (brilliantly played
by Oscar winner, Martin Landau).
Opening with one of the most
innovative and original opening
sequences for a long time, the film
is shot in black and white which
allows Tim Burton to recreate his
typical gothic, brooding visual style.
With an often very amusing script,
the film moves along at a fairly
sedate pace and although it runs
slightly longer than needed,
nevertheless it never ceases to be
engaging.
Perhaps it's true to say that it
does tend to concentrate more on
Ed Wood's film making, treating the
transvestism as a side-line which is
never really explored. And it is the
films that Wood 'makes' which are
the driving force of the movie.
Always struggling to raise the
money and sometimes shooting as
many as thirty scenes a day, what
Wood lacked in talent he made up
for in drive. He wasn't bothered
about the quality of the films so
long as his vision wasn't
compromised. In a particularly
effective scene Orson Welles tells
him to shoot his vision and nobody
else's.
As winter approaches in 18th
Century Scotland, highlands' clan
chief Rob Roy MacGregor (L/am
Neeson) enters a business venture
with the Marquis of Montrose (John
Hurt). The Marquis' tax collector
and English social parasite,
Cunningham (Tim Roth), however
conspire to steal the clan's money
and thus they risk losing their land
to the Marquis.
Whenever Hollywood gets its
hands on a historical icon, it hashes
out a story involving a great deal
more passion, drama and action
than what really happened. There's
nothing wrong with that but when
the casting is mismatched (Robin
Hood aka Kevin Costner) it is hard
to trust the story.
rob roy follows a similar
pattern; Liam Neeson being Irish
fails to convince the audience he a
Scot and so Rob Roy fails to hit the
all important culture button. The
film throws you between Rob Roy's
love of his wife, Mary, and the theft
of the money. Rob Roy tries to mix
the two stories but in the end the
film just becomes a big mess.0

This season's key idea is
refreshing simplicity, with extreme
attention to detail. So, whilst the
sleeveless shift remains an
essential it's becomes slightly
more structured than before; team
it up with chic headgear, sophis-
ticated sunglasses, well cut hair,
perfect nails and pedicured feet in
startlingly high stilettoes.
Underwear has to uphold the
unhindered line and create the
50's ultimate hourglass form. To
do this, M&S have new seamless
satin underwear and Gossard
have produced a waist clinching,
cleavage producing basque.
Before we 90's women frown,
remember that as Jill Tweedie
says, "You don't have to signal a
social conscience by looking like a
frump - lace knickers won't hasten
the Holocaust".
According to Vogue, the
essential basic wardrobe for this
season comprises of the dress, the
twinset (buy one size too small), a
waisted linen suit, a pencil skirt
and skinny top. Pencil knee-length
skirts can't really be carried by
anything other than heels - as
high and thin as you can stand up
in. The hottest, indeed the only,
footwear of the year comes in
white patent; whether 3" tall or
loafers. For those with a life to
lead that involves walking more
than three paces in a day, the fun
alternative is those childhood
favourites - jelly shoes (Ware-
house £9.99).
Warehouse is also currently
stocking a fabulous range of
skinny, lycra based tops - in the
very best of 50s' styles, and even
better, 90's prices. Sticking with
the childhood-revisited theme, for
those who like to have a startling
effect on passers-by, the new
palette influence is citrus, with
tangerine sheen, lime and glowing
yellow. Best buys in this range are
from Kangol, Oasis and Jeffrey
Rogers. The latter also stock an
excellent pair of three quarter-
length gingham capri pants for
only £16.99.
Returning to attention to
detail, the latest acclaimed
accessory is the perfectly groomed
man. Personally I prefer the old
idea of a lap dog - as Ms Carelli
so elegantly expresses it "I never
married because there was no
need. I have three pets at home
which answer the same purpose
as a man. I have a dog which
growls every morning, a parrot
which swears all the afternoon
and a cat which comes home late
at night."©
