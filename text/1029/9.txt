For hundreds of years the game of
chess has been thought of as one
of the defining marks of human
intelligence. Its grandmasters
may not have been viewed as very
useful by the general public, but
in some abstract sense we were
always glad they existed. N o w
however, the shadow of the
computer looms large over the
world of chess.
O n one level sit the big
number crunching mainframes,
with names like Deep Thought
and Deep Blue; these are the
dedicated chess machines which
play the 'full' game. Scurrying
below such behemoths are the
micro-computer based pro-
grammes; the rapidly developing
kings of'speed chess'. Perhaps the
most famous of these are the Chess
Genius series of Richard Lang.
In a similar way to many of
of those who have since come to
prominence i n the computing
field, Richard just started off
messing around at home. He also
studied Physics at Imperial. "I
worked a bit too hard and didn't
play hard enough" he joked when
I spoke to h i m over the phone
from his home on Dorset. After
graduating i n 1977, he got his
first job doing safety research for
British Gas.
"It was about the same time
that I got a home micro and just
played around with it, as a
hobby", Richard explained. A t
first he toyed with simple
programmes for noughts and
crosses and the odd video game,
but 'the first proper game pro-
gramme' he wrote was a chess
playing programme. "I started off
playing chess at school", he said
"and I did play at the college club,
but only for a term". This hobby
grew u n t i l one of this pro-
grammes won a European micro-
computer chess competition.
After that he was offered a job
with a small software house,
before going freelance a few years
later.
Chess Genius 2 burst onto
the scene last year during the
Intel Chess Grand Prix. T h i s
tournament, sponsored by the
makers of the ill-fated Pentium
chip, pitted the best micro-chess
programmes against some of the
world's top grandmasters.
"When we heard that we
were drawn against Kasparov [the
world chess champion] i n the
very first round, we thought we'd
be knocked out and go straight
home", recalled Lang. "It would
have been no disgrace to lose. I
was absolutely amazed when we
won."
O f course for the purist,
speed chess competitions are
viewed as artificial events with
each player only having a total of
twenty five minutes to make their
moves. However, the fact that it
was Kasparov that had lost,
resulted in a media explosion.
"As soon as we'd won, I
knew it was a really big event, a
mile stone i n computer chess",
Lang told me. "Kasparov looked
absolutely devastated when the
game was over and he went
backstage and disappeared from
the tournament." As another
grandmaster commented at the
time, "he [Kasparov] wanted to
crush the computer, not just beat
it".
O f course the inexorable
rise of computers i n chess has
been on the cards for a long time.
It is said that Napoleon was
fooled into believing that he had
been beaten by a mechanical
chess playing machine. In actual
fact there was a midget secreted
inside the mechanism, or so the
story goes.
By the late eighties only the
top thousand chess players were
capable of beating the best
computers. T h e n i n 1989 the
mainframe, Deep Thought, beat a
Danish Grandmaster. Kasparov
losing to a micro was seen as a
different matter.
Kasparov's hostility to
computers beating him at chess is
not merely an intellectual
reaction, though. As the top
player i n the world he makes
around £1 m i l l i o n a year. As
many have commented, who'll
want to watch people play chess
when they can buy superior
software for £100?
It's not something that
particularly concerns Richard. "I
think computers add to the game"
he said, " A car can 'run' faster
than a human and it doesn't stop
people running. Y o u can play
against a computer to improve
your game too".
With Chess Genius 3 selling
around 10,000 copies a year,
Richard says "it's an on-going
work". There are about four
similar programmes on the
market, and they're highly
competitive. Next week Richard
takes his latest development to
H o n g K o n g for the W o r l d
Computer Chess Championships.
There's also a revenge match
against Kasparov in Germany. "I
think he'll take computers much
more seriously in the future", said
Lang.
A n d the in future? "Well
maybe in ten years I'll get round
to the Chinese game of Go! I've
heard it's quite interesting". Q
