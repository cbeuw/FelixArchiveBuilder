Dear S i r .
Even i f spaoe permitted we would
not here t r y to convince you and your
readers of the horrors and inhumanities
of Apartheid as practised i n the Union of
South A f r i c a . Any of them who bother to
read t h i s l e t t e r must by now have t h e i r
opinions one way or the other.
But we f i n d i t impossible to
understand those who claim to be a n t i -
apartheid and yet seem t o be emphatically
anti-boycott. With one breath they say
that the non-European3 should be given
more rights and r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s , and with
the next that they are too irresponsible
to know what i s good f o r themselves. The
boycott these people say w i l l only harm
the non-Europeans. But surely they them-
selves are the best judges of any harm that
they may suffer and i n fact every South
African non-European organisation of any
appreciable size has asked us to support
the boycott. I f you support the underdog
i n h i s struggle f o r freedom then when the
time comes to show your support i n the
way he asks, so not hide behind excuses.
And one must admit that some of
the excuses put forward are somewhat
ludicrous!' "We cannot boycott South
African goods because we have not boycotted
those from Hungary and China." Even i f
the cases were s t r i c t l y comparable t h i s
i s s t i l l a negative approach. In the
South African case the suppressed them-
selves have asked f o r a boycott, a r e f u s a l
i s a sign of support of the Apartheid and
Baaskap p o l i c i e s .
We therefore echo Hr. Bust's
words; there i s too much apathy, too
much c r i t i c i s m with action. Here i s a
chance to sfcow your feelings against
Apartheid. Support the Boycott.
We would l i k e t o take this opp-
ortunity of asking those who are organ-
i s i n g the proposed South African Society
when t h i s Society w i l l be holding a meet-
ing to decide p o l i c y . We f e e l sure that
there are many more tbki,t&e75 signatures
r e f e r r e d to by Mr. Buet who are a c t u a l l y
pro-boycott. After a l l the aim3 of the
Society were stated t o be, simply, to
bring together those students who have
an interest i n South A f r i c a - Here was
no reference to the boycott. L a s t l y we
understand that the notice was not stolen,
as Mr. Buet accuses, but removed by the
S.C.C. Chairman a f t e r the time proscribed
which i t was h i s duty to do.

or
To Be or Not To Be
Students aspiring to the Presidenoy
may care to read the following hints
picked up from long eaperience at I.C.
There are three main methods of
action, the sportive, the s o c i a l , and,
the most succe3ful i n recent years, a
weighted combination of both.
Let us take the l a s t one f i r s t .
The point t o remember i s that you mustn't
be too good at your chosen sp^rt, or i f
you can't help being good at i t , have an
argument with the management. This w i l l
always help by getting the sympathy of
the mob. Next, don't be too obvious:
i.e. never be captain or secretary,
because y o u ' l l tread on a l o t of peoples*
toes and probably f i n i s h up by not wanting
to be President anyway. L a s t l y , don't
drink too much beer, your ojm or anyone
else^a. This leads t o exclusion from
I.C.W.A*, the surest way t o s o c i a l success
i n t h i s College.
On Thursday, 4th. Feb., i t i s
supposed that the newly-formed Beer and
Song Society had an emergency general
meeting i n order to amass forces against
the motion devised to poke into t h e i r
paunchy sanctuary. The I.C. Debating
Society, under the d e l i g h t f u l c h a i r -
womanship of Miss Tompsett, had the
motion that 'this house believes that a l l
members of the union and t h e i r guests
should be allowed into the I.C. bar,'
before i t , and sparks were expected.
John Cox, proposing, gave a f i n e
display of brinkmanship, i n e f f e c t i v e l y
reviewing everything from apartheid to
to-morrows 'Worker' e d i t o r i a l .
J.Carter,(Jim, i n case you don't know)
opposing, tossed out a selection of h i s
more contained jokes, resorting to his well
worn technique of never t a l k i n g to the
point. "You come here w i t h a pre-determine<
mind, i n any case, not r e a l l y t o l i s t e n
to mej" Perhaps some p r i n c i p a l speakers
at I.C. w i l l some day r e a l i s e that most
people attend debates i n order to hear
the p r i n c i p a l speakers speak tei the motion,
In the s o c i a l sphere, you must always
be ready to accept offers of coffee,
especially from I.C.W.A. This i s most
important. I t i s not necessary to give
coffee yourself, or even to drink the
f i l t h y s t u f f i n your own room, but never,
never, refuse an i n v i t a t i o n . I.C.W.A.,
r e a l i s i n g t h e i r p o s i t i o n as a r b i t e r s of
s o c i a l success, and having the casting
vote, as i t were, i n the P r e s i d e n t i a l
elections, w i l l damn you out of hand i f
you. refuse to be bored over coffee, or
try to be independent. So, make a l o t
of rather s u p e r f i c i a l friends among our
women, but don't on any account f a l l i n
love with one. This gives r i s e to,
what might be p o l i t e l y termed, d i f f e r e n -
ces of opinion, on the t h i r d f l o o r .
Now f o r the sporting method.
There i s only one way to make a success^
f u l attempt i n t h i s manner, and that i s
to be a Rugby Club character, par e x c e l l -
ance. In t h i s way, you make hundreds .
of enemies, but also hundreds of drunkeji
buddies who w i l l say " I t ' s about time
we had a decent bloke as President, i n -
stead of t h i s lousy shower of - ". The
- indicates some suitable epithet. A
f e e l i n g then arises among the sportsmen
that something mu3t be done, and abusive
attacks are made on Council, from which
you of course, stand aloof. You then
become accepted as a natural candidate
by the boozers, and the only reasonable
boozer by the h o i - p o l l o i . This could
work w e l l , but has not, I believe, been
successful.
Lastly we come to the s o c i a l tech-
nique, t h i s i s the most d i f f i c u l t of
them a l l , and requires a l o t of nerves,
guts, and the a b i l i t y to speak i n
debates. I would not suggest t h i s
method to anyone except an obvious
candidate.
Now you know how to become Presi*>
dent, and i f you succeed, you can look
forward t o a year of absolute h e l l ,
beoause those who wanted to be President
in your year, those who want to be
President ilext year, a motley c o l l e c t i o n
of s t i r r e r s , and your Supervisor, w i l l
all-combine to make you look an i d i o t .
Coed luck friends, you need i t .
The second speakers wen. .

than usual standard and thoughtsreturned
to/ the gay b i t of f l u f f d e l i c a t e l y skipping
over the body-strewn f l o o r f o r d a i l y
Guinness , The f l o o r speeches were
spasmodic, faoes tending t o the - "Whose
rouhd next?" - expression. The ex-
Bresident of Debates, r e j o i c i n g i n h i s
newly found plebian freedom, shed h i s
apathy, and twice attempted t o add a touch
of class to the proceedings, with some
success i t must be added. In the f i n a l
speech, John Cox returned to h i s more
usual form, and added a touch of serious-
ness, which might have caused one or two
people, t o think c a r e f u l l y of t h e i r own
p o s i t i o n , i f not of the motion. A l l i n
a l l , a disappointing debate, r a r e l y
reaching the standards that one should
expect from t h i s College of Science and
Technology. The motion, by the way, was
defeated, with more,abstentions than votes
for.
