For the seorid year in succession
I.C. have reaohed the Final round of the
Q.L. Soccer Challenge Cup tournament.
As cup-holders and with a well-balanoed
distribution of University and Sidomian
footballers in the side they must now
be favourites to retain the sup against
Goldsmiths College on February 27th.
However, as thooe who nacohed the
2nd round match against L.S.E, and the
amusing semi-final game against M ,
10 days ago are aware, the path to the
final has not seen easy- The tremend-
ous excitement of the first semi-final
game with U.C. in which I.C. took a
4-1 lead and then allowed their oppo-
nents to level at 4-4 was not repeated
in the game at Motspur on Feb. 6th,
when I.C. demonstrated their super-
iority by winning 5-0.
I.C. with Austin and Payne ret-
urning to the side and U.C. with a
new left-winger were well-matohed
for the f i r s t 20 minutes although
I.C. already had a territorial advan-
tage. The very strong U.C. forward
line was well held during t h i s period
by quick tackling and good covering.
The two Steves, (Fisher and Pick) at
full-backs and James our Welsh
international at centre-half played
coolly and intelligently using the
long ball well so as to cut the TJ.C.
forwards out of the game as much as
possible.
Our f i r 3 t goal came mid-wa,,
through the f i r s t half following a
corner-Kick and this turned out to
be the oruoial point in the whole
match, U.C. up to thia goal were
well i n the fight but having made
suoh a tremendous recovery in the pre-
vious game i t seemed that they had not
the physical and mental aeserves to do
i t again. I.C. now had the adge a l l
the time and although U.C., true cup-
fighters that they are, never cracked or
save up trying goals were bound to acta®
Towards the end of the f i r s t half Colin
Harris made i t 2-0 the sides changed ends
at this soore.

A f i r s t meeting of the Rugby Fives
Club has been arranged f o r 5.15 «i Monday
15th Feb. i n Committee Room A i n the Unioj
to elect o f f i c e r s and arrange a c t i v i t i e s
for the r e s t of the year. I t i 3 t o be
hoped that all.those who have signed the
l i s t i n the union w i l l t r y to attend and.
anyone else interested. A supplementary
grant has been put into the A.C.C., and
a few pairs of gloves and b a l l s w i l l be
purchased when the courts are ready.
The I.C. Forwards by this time were
playing extremely w e l l and to them chief
ionours must go f o r t h i s great viotory.
The three inside-forwards worked
f u r i o u s l y tackling back w e l l and
oarrying danger into the U.C. pen-
a l t y area every time they'moved
forward. The wingers who had
excellent service made good use of i t ,
George Wenk on the l e f t giving Jim
Whetton the University full-baok the
most worring game he must have had f o r
a long time.
The t h i r d anu best goal of the
match was scored by Harris with an
excellent 20 yard shot. The chance being
given to him by a piece of very quick
thinking by Mousset-Jones. The fourth
goal was scored direct from a corner by
Wenk,.and the f i f t h a t y p i c a l opportunist
goal by Finney.
I t was at this stage of the game
that captain Faulkner made the biggest
faux-pas the I.C. team made a l l a f t e r -
noon, when, hearing the referee's whistle
and thinking i t was a l l over he began to
give the oheers f o r U.C. The r e f .
however decided that he had whistled f o r
a f o u l and that there waa a further 10
minutes to play....such was the tension
In the gaiue, and suoh was the r e l i e f
of na/ihg won through to the f i n a l
when the f i n a l whistle blew.
We thank our supporters who travelled
to Motspur and hope they w i l l come
together with many more to cheer us t o
viotory i n the f i n a l on Sat. Feb. 27th,
We wish the Rugby Olub success i n t h e i r
semi-final so that I.C. w i l l be repress
ented i n a l l the three U.L. Cup F i n a l s .

By scoring 15 goals to 3 goals ag-
ainst i n 3 matches Imperial College have
reaohed the final of the U.L.Cup
The matches were: -
1st round v Wye College 5 - 0
2nd round v L.S.E. 7 - 2
Semi final v St.George's Hosp. 3 - 1
The final i s to be played against
Battersea who we defeated in the cup last
year. However, those with lo»g memories
will remember the only other occasion
when I.C. reaohed the final, they were
defeated by Battersea. Thus this match
K i l l undoubtedly, be keenly fought with
good hockey on both sides.
St. George's Hospital, gave a good
account of themselves iTi the semi final
and certainly at one stage of the game
I.C. didn't laok like scoring. Thegame
opened with a direct attack from St.
George's, in whioh they were unlucky not
to soore. However, I.C. settled down and
the game developed into a battle between
the I.C. forwards and the St. George's
defence. At half time the score was 0-0
mainly due to the inability of the I.C,
forwards to make proper use of the chances
offered. St. George's sprang back to the
offensive in the 2nd half with a superb
goal from their left wing. This was in-
deed a slap in the face for I.C.+who rep-
lied by forcing a succession of corners,
from one of these Mick Miller scored and
then the I.C. team started to play the
class of hookey expected from them, 2
more goals being scored before the finish
Final soore; I.C. 3 - St. George's 1.
The lesson learned from this match
is 'Never to underestimate your opponents

I.C. Swimiiing Club oontinues t o be
very good a t water polo, and t e r r i b l e a t
everything else. The f i r s t team, l i k e l y
candidates f o r the U.L.U. championship,
defeated St. Barta Hospital i n a league
match 7 - 2, a good viotory. The 2nd.
and 3rd. teams are a l s o i n a winning
mood so f a r this term, and a l l in a l l ,
some reasonable polo has been played.
Last Friday B r i s t o l came t o play us
and although the I.C. team had three res-
erves .playing, won comfortably 7 - 2.
However, the men3' swimming match was
l o s t , and l.C.W.A. , combining with
U.C. l a d i e s , also l o s t , despite some
v a l i a n t U.C. e f f o r t s .

The I.C. Basket-ball Club has
continued i t s run o f success and since
the l a s t report the 1st team have played
8 matches, winning 7 of them. The only
defeat was t o a strong Polytechnic team
onaie f i r s t day of term when the effects
of a well-spent vacation became apparent.
4'e remain second to Battersea i n the
University League, having beaten Goldsmiths
45-34 and Woolwich 56-46. The match
against Goldsmiths was harder than the
score 3. ggests since we were t r a i l i n g
17-24 at half-time. Up t o t h i s point we
were playing a^zciie defenoe against a f a s t
moving attack with a free-scoring pivot
who had scored 14 points i n the half. On
the resumption I.C. ohanged t o a man»to-man
defenoe - played f o r the f i r s t time t h i s
season - and had considerable success,
winning that h a l f 25-10 and cona'equently
tljg_match. Mike Barron'3 set shots were
as ever and he scored 24 points - 18 i n
the second half. Don Parker (10 points)
also played well i n attack and Jack ttr^fjr
and Tony Hind gave safe performances i n
defence.
In the London League - D i v i s i o n II,
I.C. are unbeaten a f t e r playing 11 o f
the soheduled 16 matches. We completed
the f i r s t h a l f of the season l a s t term
by defeating Holloway (80-43) and. House
United (42-29). The l a t t e r match was
more reminiscent of Twickenham rather than
a Basket-ball Court and the least said
about i t the better. So f a r t h i s term we
have played Borough Road, Huntingfield
and Kingston Y.M.C.A. defeating them
59-36, 57-27, 67-27 r e s p e c t i v e l y . The
Kingston match eaw some excellent defensive
play by Fryer and Wickenden as the half-time
scare of 30-5 suggests. Our main scaring
shots were the set ones of Barron (27 pts)
and Mathews (20 pt3) with Alex Termanis
(13 p t s ) waiting f o r the loose ones under
the basket.
The 2nd team have had tw- matches t h i s
year. They drew 31-31 with Battersea II
i n a f r i e n d l y matoh and defeated Woolwich
I I 92-42. i n the U.L.U. League - Division II.
In t h i s match the main scorers were Sam
Borenstein with a remarkable 42 points,
Bob Ralph with 28 and Dave Masson with
18 points.
