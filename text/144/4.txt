"Not a bad issue,""a better F e l i x than
usual". Comments l i k e these f l o a t e d around
our ears when the l a s t issue appeared. WE
We are to blame,of course. That you, the
Union, d i d p r a c t i c a l l y nothing worth p r i n -
t i n g ; that you WROTE p r a o t i o a l l y nothing
worth p r i n t i n g ; that you presumably had
nothing worth w r i t i n g ; a l l these are minor"
points compared with our dreadful error i n
producing a F e l i x , whioh i n your estim -
ation,"wasn't up t o standard."
But while you crumbled, even then you
did not bother to ;>ick up a pen and say,
"I think that such and such an a r t i c l e i s
stnpid. Why not ?" We can only pre-
sume that you are f a r busier than i s good
for you, or that you are s c i e n t i s t s of the
type referred t o by the eminent S i r Bruce
White. " S c i e n t i s t s should be on tap, not
on top."
F e l i x i s the pulse of student opinion.
We would only be too pleased to p r i n t your
views, and you ought to be able to read
others. As i t i s , the only views you ever
read are those of the F e l i x board, togethei
with the handful of outside (Hostel) s t a l -
warts; because these are the only people
who ever write to F e l i x .
The decline of the power to write
among s c i e n t i s t s i s a grave i l l . The pro-
fession has never been noted f o r i t s orat-
ors; thus l i t e r a t u r e i s i t s best way of
s e l f expression. Now, when the s c i e n t i s t
i s of more importance to the world than
ever before, he i s becoming i n a r t i c u l a t e ,
apart from the l i m i t e d perfection he can
achieve i n h i s so c a l l e d s p e c i a l i s e d tech-
n i c a l papers and reports. The reasoning
voioe of the s c i e n t i s t , the man who knows,
i s seldom heard i n the c l a t t e r and babble
of p o l i t i c a l fury which sweeps over the
world; but a t I.C. i t i s d i f f e r e n t . The
a u t h o r i t i e s , i f they are wise, pay attent-
ion to the w i l l of the students. The
WILL of the students oould be expressed
through F e l i x . That i s why i t e x i s t s .
I f you pay your fourpenoe every
f o r t n i g h t , that helps to keep F e l i x
independent. We are not subsidised,
•md we are not obliged t o print auv
thing we don't want t o p r i n t . NeKSter
are we subject to censorship. But
these advantages whioh your fourpence
manages to hold secure, are not much
use i f you do not supply us with some-
thing t o proclaim our independence
and TOURS.
Important news comes r a r e l y ; and
we f i l l a good deal of our space with
features, some u s e f u l , some f a i n t l y
humorous. Here we r e l y on you. I f
the material i s there, we w i l l present
i t . I f the enthusiasm i s there, we
w i l l r e f l e c t and amplify i t . I f
apathy,is there, we can only weep.

Dear S i r ,
I am usually prevented from w r i t i n g
to your newspaper by the one fact that SC
muoh has aroused my i r e that I wouldn't
know where t o s t a r t .
Today however I was roused by one
thing above a l l else and so w i l l con-
centrate on t h i s . I r e f e r to the l e t t e r
by your C r i t i c " R i c c i . " Having nothing
whatsoever to do with the dramatic society
as d i d your previous correspondent, Mr.
Shipley, preface my c r i t i c i s m with an
apology.
R i c c i appears from h i s l e t t e r , both
through i t s form and the views expressed
therein, t o be an I n t e l l e c t u a l , Long
Haired, n i t . I am aware that my descrip-
t i o n i s r e p e t i t i v e . A man who cannot sort
his ideas out better than R i c c i does should
not be allowed to c r i t i c i s e , f o r the essence
of. c r i t i c i s m i s surely a balance of pros
and cons. I f the pros are greater than
the cons then the c r i t i c i s m i s favourable
and vice versa. How does R i c c i attempt
to separate " t e l l i ig a story'1
from
"investigating a s i t u a t i o n . " Without a
s i t u a t i o n there can be no story and i n
t e l l i n g the story the s i t u a t i o n must
be c l a r i f i e d , which presumably involves
the investigation of factors influencing
the s i t u a t i o n . Sometimes the investigation
i s deeper than oth.rs but to separate and
divide as R i c c i does brings us back to
the old argument of which came f i r s t , the
Chicken or the Egg. (Can any expert on
evolution help?)
B a s i c a l l y I believe that plays,
s t o r i e s and poems were written o r i g i n a l l y
f o r entertainment on the one side and
p r o f i t on the other. The expression of
a writer's feelings whilst doing t h i s i s
usually subconscious i f the play i s to
become a r t at a l l , and i t w i l l only be-
come great a r t i f these feelings touch
on the fundamental experiences of l i f e .
Let us be entertained f o r then we w i l l
l i s t e n and l e t us c r i t i c i s e accordingly.
I t i s an o l d p l a t i t u d e that Secrets w i l l
out, but I am happy to say that so w i l l
art without your pet (mon)goose R i o o i
delving i n and looking f o r i t .

Dear S i r ,
I should l i k e to take t h i s opport-
unity of bringing t o your notice the fox-
l i k e behaviour of a c e r t a i n person who,
i t would appear, i s against foxhunting.
The I.C. Riding Club decided t o give a
t a l k on foxhunting t h i s term and was very
kindly given a lecturer from the B r i t i s h
F i e l d Sports Society panel. A poster
was put up of the Internal Union Board,
advertising t h i s meeting but within a
few days i t had been torn down.
This l e t t e r was held back i n the
hope that the persons who were against
foxhunting would aopear at the meeting
but t h e i r t a c t i c s seemed t o exclude
honourable methods of approach.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Tony Gillham,
Pres. Riding Club.

Dear S i r or Man,
Like t h i s Rimshot i s a
juvenile i n size 10 boats. In h i s (?)
f i r s t a r t i c l e he gave a l u c i d , i n t e r -
esting aocount of the h i s t o r y of jazz
i n 1959 from temporary v i s i t s t o perm-
anent e x i t s . Then i n h i s l a s t ( I hope)
a r t i c l e a sad contrast; that John
Staccato i s the greatest i s not f o r me
to judge but one can hope that he w i l l
not l a s t .
A normal c h i l d when introduoed t o
swinging musik w i l l often express h i s
enjoyment by piping i n a high pitched
tenor " I l i k e i t , Daddy." Now imag-
ine a beatnik juvenile i n a s i m i l a r
p o s i t i o n , i f you can f i r s t imagine
suoh a person enjoying anything, and
you w i l l get something so - "Like i t
swings, Daddy-o,"growled i n a grav-
e l l y bass.
Is t h i s what Rimshot i s antio -
i p a t i n g : i s he a worn out D.J. from
some f a r o f f island whose eight dlsos
have ceased to e n t h r a l l him, or i s he
a reincarnation giving us a taste of
the future.
Like I'm hoping the seoond a r t -
i c l e was a lapse i n s t y l e .
Bagshot.
With apologies to no one.

Dear S i r ,
For how much longer .will Imperial
College, the most important science
college i n B r i t a i n , labour under the
ridiculous burden of possessing no
separately constituted department f o r
teaching mathematical physics. Those
of us who i n our Third Year attempt to
become the theoreticians of the future
have the extremely irksome arrangement
of taking our lectures commonly with
the mathematics second or t h i r d year.
Excellent- though these lecturers are,
t h e i r i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the materials
i s l i a b l e to be defined more from the
point of view of the rigorous mathe-
matician than from the standpoint of the
p h y s i c i s t , who i s more interested i n the
use of mathematical tools than i n the
a n a l y t i c a l discussion of these tools.
For my part, I f i n d that l i v i n g this
"double l i f e " between the maths, and
physics buildings has created innum-
erable Freudian complexes which can
only be resolved by the ultimate fate
of us a l l - madness!
Yours i n Bedlam,
Fred iloberts.
