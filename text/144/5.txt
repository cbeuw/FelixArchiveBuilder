F E M X ,
Last week, Mr, Oheeney's excellent
posters t o l d us, was Exploration Week at
Imperial College. Now i t ' s a l l over we
can look back and ask ourselves why. Why
hold an exhibition? Why publish a review?
The reastoi3 are several. F i r s t and per-
haps foremost, i s that we've had a large
number of expeditions i n reoent years,
some of them bad, some mediocre but most
of them good. Not many people r e a l i s e d
what had been done on these expeditions
and so the Exploration Week gave them a
chance t o learn. In addition t o t h i s
many firms and sections of industry had
supported these expeditions, both f i n -
a n o i a l l y and i n kind, and thds was t h e i r
chance too, to see the r e s u l t s of t h e i r
support. A t h i r d , and equally good reas-
on, i s that i f the present high standard
of exploration at Imperial College i s to
continue, new blood and ideas must enter
the f i e l d from outside, and new people
become interested.
The e x h i b i t i o n was opened by the
Rector on Monday and, despite the railway
s t r i k e , about twenty representatives from
firms attended the opening. At the open-
ing the Rector announced that he had rec-
eived a telegram of best wishes for the
Exploration Week from the present contin-
gent of f i v e I.C. men at present with
F.I.D.S. i n the Antarctic. A very
thoughtful and timely gesture.
To coincide with the e x h i b i t i o n , a
p u b l i c a t i o n , "The I.C. Exploitation Review"
was brought out. The editor, N i g e l Clark,
and h i s s t a f f are to be congratulated on
the high standard of thi3 review, espec-
i a l l y as none of them had had any previous
experience of publication.
On Tuesday and Thursday at lunchtime
Or, Cott and Mr. iXincan Carse lectured on
A f r i c a anfl the Antarctic respectively.
Both lectures were b e a u t i f u l l y i l l u s t r a t e d
and were generally enjoyed.
The ''IxplOBation Society Dinner was
held on Wednesday, and i t was pleasing t o
see that quite a number of people brought
guests.
F i n a l l y , what was the general impr-
ession of the week? Host people seemed
pleased with the e x h i b i t i o n , and many
people from outside seemed t o have a t t -
ended. Five hundred copies of the review
have been sold, and the lectures wers
quite w e l l attended. In a l l , the reaction
has been encouraging.

T H E S P E C I A L I S T
The I n s t i t u t e of Advanced Motorists
was formed three years ago, w i t h Govern-
ment help. I t s aim was to improve the
standard of driving i n t h i s country by
means of tests and lectures. At present
i t tests about 8.000 people a year, of
whom about 50 per cent pass. The I n s t i -
tute also organizes s o c i a l and sporting
rvents f o r i t s members.
During the three years, the Inst-
i t u t e ' s tests have received much p u b l i c i t y
and the standard i s generally accepted to
be very high. I t i s not considered a d i s -
grace to f a i l . Application f o r a test
i s iade on a form provided by the I n s t i -
tute, which includes questions on d r i v i n g
experience, age, occupation and type of
car, etc. The fee i s £2 but a further £1
has to be sent with t h i s as a year's sub-
s c r i p t i o n f o r membership. A test i s
usually arranged about 6 t o 8 weeks a f t e r
the form i3 received.
I arrived f o r my test rather
nervously because not only had a l o t
of people taken an interest i n my
being tested, but my car was 3 years older
than T and lacked many of the improvements
a modern car has. The examiner met me
and introduced himself, lie wnrned me that
the test would cover a l l types of road
but that there would be no "catches." He
expected a very high standard of d r i v i n g
but said he would not ask questions on
the Highway Code, although I must not
break any of i t s r u l e s .
After t h i s b r i e f introduction we
moved o f f . Immediately he gave me a
very steep h i l l 3tart. I managed t o
do t h i s quite w e l l and.acquired some
confidence. The route was over about
35 miles of mixed roads, i n heavy and
l i g h t t r a f f i c . The examiner gave very
clear instructions as to the route and
we started to discus s the r e l a t i v e merits
of different makes of cars. He d i d not
once mention my d r i v i n g although he often
c r i t i c i z e d the d r i v i n g of other road users
we saw. He commented on the good condition
of my car, saying that i f a l l cars had as
much attention paid to them as mine, there
would be fewer accidents.
Later he asked me to give a running
co:,ment6xy on my thouc;ht3, whioh was rather
d i f f i c u l t . L u c k i l y I had expected t h i s
and practised a l i t t l e before. I remem-
bered to mention the t r a f f i c conditions
behind and w e l l i n front and to canment
on pedestrians. A f t e r about two minutes
he said I could stop. This was the hardest
point of the test as I tended t o think at
the same rate as I was t a l k i n g .

e finished back at the s t a r t i n g point
a f t e r about an hour and a h a l f , and he
then c r i t i c i z e d my driving. I had been
over cautious., but t h i s was probably
because I was under t e s t . I had t o
r e a l i z e that the I n s t i t u t e required a
very high standard and i t was no disgrace
to f a i l . However, I had passedi! He went
on to compliment seme points of my d r i v i n g
and said that my techni-jue on roundabouts
was the best he had seen f o r a long time.
I was very surprised to have passed be-
cause I made mistakes on the test that I
do not normally make, but he must have
put these down to nerves.
This summer my father took the test
and passed. He then suggested that I
should take i t and volunteered t o pay
for me. He wished to show, by my pass-
ing, how low the standard r e a l l y was. I
had been d r i v i n g f o r only 3 years, and,
he claimed, could not have reached a
very high standard. Because I wis free
to accept a test at any time of day
duri ,g the next month, I was able t o
f i x an appointment w i t h i n three weeks
of malting an application.
At one point he asked me to describe
the la3t roadsign passed, obviously to
check on my observation. I r e p l i e d that
I was not sure, but expected that i t w.as
a "Road Harrows" sign, because the road
had just reduced i n width and T was taking
care to give room t o vehicles coming the
other way. He seemed quite s a t i s f i e d .
With t h i s r e p l y . Later he asked me to
do two special tests. The f i r s t was to
turn the car round i n a very harrow road;
he t o l d me afterwards t h r t he wished to
see i f I knew the s i z e of my car and d i d
not l e t i t h i t the kerbs. The other was
to reverse round a small triangular island
which was on a steep slope, and to keep
as close i n as possible the whole way rand .
I had. to f i n i s h w i t h the oar parked by the
kerb facing up the h i l l .
The t e s t has had no r e a l effect on my
d r i v i n g . Immediately a f t e r passing I
drove very cautiously as I f e l t the
"Hesponsibllity" of being an "Advanced
Motorist." However, this phase 300n wore
off and I drove nor lally again, I now
no longer t r y to prove myself a good
driver, but Jet my friends look at the
badge on the front of my car instead.
The fact that I passed, not only proves
my father's point that the standard of
the test i s not so high, but as half
the candidates that take the test f a i l ,
the general standard of d r i v i n g on the
roads to-day must be very low.
