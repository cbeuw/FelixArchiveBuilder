by Dr. Hugh B. Cott aa part of the I.C.
Exploration Week.
It i s refreshingly rare to f i n d an
sxplorer, who does not t a l k about h i s
Last, or l a s t but one expedition, but
3an put over to an audience some of the
looumulated experience which he has gained
hiring a l i f e t i m e of exploration. Br.
high B. Cott, the direotor of the Univ-
i r s i t y Museum of Zoology, Cambridge has
this a b i l i t y , and as a r e s u l t the l e c t u r e
rhich he gave as part of the general
studies programme on Tuesday was one of
the best lectures on exploration we have
yet heard at I.C.
Dr. Cott started by saying he was
lot an explorer, but merely a t r a v e l l e r
and a n a t u r a l i s t . As h i s lecture pro-
oeeded i t beoame obvious that t h i s was
not quite the truth. Many of the close
up shots of w i l d animals which he
showed revealed not only a standard of
photography of the highest technioal
excellence but a l s o a very obvious
disregard of personal danger. His
comment that. .. "when photographing
w i l d animals, i n order to get a good
photograph, one shouldn't j u s t point
the camera at i t , but get close enough
so that i t f i l l s the r e f l e x screen"...
surely puts him into the c l a s s of an
explorer, i n t h i s p a r t i c u l a r f i e l d
at l e a s t .
In the f i r s t part of his lecture,
Dr. Cott compared t r o p i c a l with other
types of exploration. He pointed out
that the amount of equipment needed
in the tropias i s small by comparison
with, say, a polar or a high mountain
expedition, and that a t r o p i o a l ex -
pedition can very e a s i l y l i v e o f f the
land. Further that polar exploration
is more l i k e l y to be concerned with
geophysical or geographical explorat-
ion, and that i n the, tropics attention
Is n a t u r a l l y fooussed more on the imm-
ense v a r i e t y of both animal and plant
l i f e whioh exists there.
Dr. Cott moved next t o photo-
graphy, a subject evidently close t o
his. heart, and pointed out that bas-
i c a l l y there were two techniques.
One could e i t h e r be prepared and try
to get photographs as the opportunity
arose, or one oould wait f o r the sub-
j e c t and plan any given photograph.
F i n a l l y , to end h i s t a l k , Dr. Cott
s a i d that even an explorer oould not
be on the move and working a l l the time,
and that a hobby was e s s e n t i a l . He
then showed a s e r i e s of s l i d e s of pen
and ink sketches done during his
spare moments i n A f r i a a . At t h i s
juncture Dr, Cott showed himself
to be not only a first rate photographer,
but an a r t i s t of quite exoeptianal t a l -
ent. Indeed, these f i n a l sketches left
the audienoe with suoh a v i v i d impression
of their eubjeot, that photograph, even
of Br. Cott's high standard, oould no
where near equal them.

The second team was unlucky to lose
by only half a point to U n i v e r s i t y College
i n a league f i x t u r e held at Mitcham on Wed.
27th. In the same matoh KiJig's College
and L.S.B. were e a s i l y defeated. The I.C
runners were w e l l spread out a f t e r the
s i x mile run: Huntley (3), Hammonds (5)
and B u t l e r (8) were the f i r s t three home.
On the same day another second team
heavily defeated Brentwood School by 29
pts. t o 49 at Petersham. Bernard was
f i r s t with Berber (2) and Yi'arren (3) f o l l -
owing some way behind.
A f i r s t team t r a v e l l e d to Aylesbury
on the f o l l o w i n g Saturday to run against
the Vale of Aylesbury A t h l e t i c Club. The
match was very close and resulted, i n a
narrow v i c t o r y f o r I.C. by 27 pts. to
28. The course was heavy and times were
correspondingly slow. C o l l i n s (2) finished
f i r s t f o r I.C. with Bernard (3) not f a r
behind. At the same time a second team
e a s i l y defeated Bancroft's School i n Essex.
With 6 runners i n the f i r s t seven positions
the f i n a l score was I.C. 2nd, 13 pts.
Benoroft's School 29 pts. Notable perform-
ances were those of George Turner, vrtio won,
and Hoger Hedge, our new up and coming star
who was f i f t h .
The University College Annual I n v i t -
a t i o n Race was held at Parliament H i l l
F i e l d s on Saturday 6th Feb, A strong
Oxford Tortoises team won with 88 pts.
followed by I.C. f i r s t team with 90 pts.
and Southampton U n i v e r s i t y 121 pts. The
second team were 8th being the fourth Lon-
don College team t o f i n i s h . John C o l l i n s
was 2nd while Larkum (10), Bernard (12)
Barber (16) and Warren (21) put up very
good performances. Roger Hedge was the
t h i r d 2nd team runner t o cross the l i n e .

Lands End - John 0'Groats Relay.
This i s a r e l a y race on a point to
point basis i n which a team of 8 runners
(and two reserves) t r y to cover the d i s -
tance i n as short a time as possible. The
usual method i s to run the distance i n ten
mile stages but other v a r i a t i o n s have been
used.
At present Birmingham U n i v e r s i t y
hold the record, w i t h a time of under 93
hours; other U n i v e r s i t i e s t o have com-,
pleted are Oxford (the o r i g i n a t o r s ) ,
Cambridge and Exeter while an attempt by
B r i s t o l was defeated by l a s t summer's
hot weather.
I t had been hoped that an I.C.
team should make an attempt but instead
the team w i l l now be drawn from the whole
University. Even so i t i s l i k e l y that the
major support w i l l be from t h i s College.
The two reserves are taken so that
i f one of the team breaks down the whole
attempt can continue using a replacement.
These two a l s o act as oooks, drivers, etc.
but even so several others w i l l be needed
to complete the Escort Party, and anyone
interested i n taking part i s asked t o
contact J . H. C o l l i n s through the Union
Rack - I t should be pointed out that the
actual running i s one of the lesser prob-
lems compared with arranging Escort
vehicles and meals and sleeping of the
Runners.

The 1st team have continued i n
t h e i r winning vein over the l a s t fortnight,
beatirir Keble College. Oxford (3-2), ".Vest-
minster Hospital ( 4 - l ) , Leicester Univer-
s i t y (4-1), St. Catharine's College, Cam-
bridge (3-2), but unfortunately they went
down t o London Hospital, with a much
weakened team (3-2): we hope to reverse
t h i s d e c i s i v e l y on the 16th l?
eb. when they
oome to play at I.C. The viotory against
Leicester was very pleasing, since they
were one of the three sides to beat us
l a s t term.
Unfortunately everyone was elim-
inated from the U.L. Cup i n the 1 st and
2nd rounds. B r i a n Avient went out t o
Mike Kingston, the University Captain,
finding i t d i f f i c u l t to^get used to the
f a s t casts at St. Mary's. Peter Odell
l o s t t o Tim Goodwin, U.L. Secretary.
Hans Espig to Gazadar, ex-U.L. Captain
and P a k i s t a n i international; they could
hardly have picked b e t t e r opponents S
B r i a n Haywood l o s t t o Tony C h i g n e l l i n a
very good match, but he found to his oost
that the effects of too much Christmas
"pud" were s t i l l with him. No news has
been heard from U.C. concerning the i n t e r -
college 3-a-side competition, so i t looks
as though we may have a w.o. into the
3rd round.
The 2nd Team's record i s not quite
SO good and they have had to put up with
a. number of cancellations, but we hope they
w i l l manage t o make a b e t t e r f i n i s h to
the season.
Next week the 1 s t Team has a busy
time with four matches on hand. The
Escorts (H) on Monday, King's College (H)
on Tuesday, Ashstead (A) on Thursday, and
Yiueen' s'College, Cambridge (H) on Saturday.
Escorts and Ashstead were two of the three
clubs which beat u3 l a s t year, out of
about 30 played, and Quern's beat us (0-5)'
l a s t term; we s h a l l have a hard task on
hand i f we are to beat a l l three.
The run i s planned f o r the week
a f t e r Easter ( A p r i l 19th - 26th) when i t
i3 hoped that weather conditions w i l l hot
be too unfavourable
