The history of the B r i t i s h "musical"
has so far. been one of a series of unin-
spired "tonio" productions oonsisting of
a thick s l i o e of one aspect of B r i t i s h
l i f e oovered with a layer of clotted sen-
timentality. Except f o r Osborne's
"World of a Paul Sliokey" whioh oould not
i n any way be oalled a success, t h i s has
always been the case. The current pro-
duction at the Royal Court "The L i l y
White Boys" may, I hope, be the f i r s t of
many to break away from this t r a d i t i o n .
Tart, Cosh k i d and Wide boy decide
that crime does not pay, that i t i s the
respectable that are comfortable and they
set about seeing how they might j o i n t h i s ,
to them, e l i t e group. Psychologically
improbable, maybe, but this i s of no
importance to Harry Cookson, the playwright
who develops the s i t u a t i o n with a b i t i n g
s a t i r e whioh i s continually present (perhaps
too much so). The l y r i c s , which are only
used when necessary, are by Christopher
Logue and are set to music by Tony Kinsey
and B i l l Le Sage. The whole thing i s
b r i l l i a n t l y produoed by Linsay Anderson.
Also recently opened, i n the West End
i s another very f i n e play - John Mortimer's
"The Wrong Side of the Park". I t i s
extremely d i f f i c u l t to say something
b r i e f l y about t h i s production, the basic
complexity of whioh i s added to by the
presence of several i m p l a u s i b i l i t i e s .
The situation i s to begin with this:
the Lee family, including parents and
sister-in-law l i v e i n a large house
f u l l of Viotorian gloom and typioally
over ornate. Into the house comes a
lodger, who evokes i n Mis. Elaine Lee
memories of he f i r s t husband. Elaine,
played with beautiful oontrol by
Margaret Leighton, i s a neurotic, ner-
vously overwrought and drawn between
the aoutal r e a l i t y of her present hus-
band and the i d e a l i s a t i o n of her former
husband i n the lodger, both of whom she
i s inevitably comparing. Richard
Johnson taokles very successfully the
d i f f i c u l t part of Elaine's husband with
f i n e suppnfct from Robert Stephens and
Wendy Craig. Peter H a l l d i r e c t s .

The evening of Friday, January 30th
saw a remarkable display of dinner jack-
ets, white shirts and pretty g i r l s .
The occasion was, of course, the Engineers'
B a l l , claimed by C. & G. to be the l a s t
word i n I.C. s o c i a l functions. Certain
i t i s that the dinner was excellent, but
not more so than the speeches. Jolyon
Nove, C. <
j
b G. President, opened the
a f t e r dinner a c t i v i t i e s when he paid
tribute to Mr. Manton's long service to
Guilds Union as Honorary Treasurer. He
presented Mr. Manton with an inscribed
tankard and salver. Mr. Manton replied
by saying that he had enjoyed doing the
job and that i t involved very l i t t l e
work. I t i s very d i f f i c u l t to believe
this last remark f o r Mr. Manton has put
in an immense amount of work and the
Union r e a l l y i s very grateful to him.
The Dean, Professor Saunders, then
proposed the health of tb» Union and
Jolyon Nove replied. Tim Wadsworth
proposed the health of the guests i n a
very witty manner with references to
the past of the guest of honour, Monty
Holbein, these caused a great deal of
laughter, especially from Mr. Holbein.
The other guests, including the Chief
Percolator of the Instant Coffee Warming
Amalgamation, the Presidents of t.C. and
Mines, and stepping i n f o r a s l i g h t l y
jaundiced John Forster, the Secretary of
R.C.S., were also w i t t i l y welcomed.
Monty Holbein then rose,and gave oodles
of advice to a l l the young ladies pre-
sent on how to marry an engineer and a l l
that. This was r e a l l y uproarious and
was well received by a l l .
The b a l l was very good, the bar and
coffee p i t w e l l patronised, and a good
time so to speak was had by a l l . I
think congratulations are due to the
Guilds Entertainments' Committee, and
especially to Tim Wadsworth, who
organised the whole a f f a i r very
competently.

G A R D E N E R S
As many readers w i l l probably know,
jazz at Imperial College i s i n a very
healthy state. At t h i s time of year the
usual spate of jazz competitions appears
on the scene, and t h i s year I.C. w i l l
probably be better represented than ever.
Jazz competitions generally tend to be
rather poor a f f a i r s f o r the musicians
taking part. They are usually organised
by people who' know very l i t t l e about
musia and musicians and are often judged
by people who know even l e s s l The usual
state of a f f a i r s i s with about ten bands
and one stand - that means ten drum k i t s ,
ten basses and about f i f t y musicians,
and one stand. About f i v e minutes play-
ing time i s allowed f o r each band (how
can a band possibly show i t s c a p a b i l i t i e s
in two Bhort numbers?),and probably
twice as raich i s allowed f o r changing
bands over. The time spent by the judges
in the bar constitutes a large proportion
of the evening. Needless to say condit-
ions are somewhat shambolic - one might
even say chaotic.
Then why do we enter - you might say
Obviously the thought of winning complet-
ely overshadows any thoughts concerning
the administration. Then there i s pres-
tige; a l l the other b i g oollegea are go-
ing to enter. We have bands whioh can
outplay a l l of them put together.
So .we enter.
Ken Gibson's t r a d i t i o n a l band has
received w e l l deserved praise from a l l
sides. Formed only a few weeks ago,
they have now b u i l t up a large reper-
t o i r e and are playing a b e a u t i f u l l y
relaxed style of t r a d i t i o n a l jazz.This
group has been entered f o r the WUS
Competition organised by N.E.C. and
they received favourable comment from
the judges of the preliminary round.
They are also entered f o r the Inter -
U n i v e r s i t i e s Jazz Competition at
Reading on Feb. 17th. May I wish them
the very best of luck - they deserve i t .
The Jazz Gardeners comprising
Messrs. Rushton, Farnsworth and P r i t -
chard oontinue to reoeive high praise
from a l l quarters. Their playing at
hops i s always attended by an appreo -
i a t i v e audience and congratulatory
remarks just f l o o d i n . Their progress
seems continuous - a wonderful record-
ing session i n the Pye - Nixa studios
and the prospects of a commercial record
are among their latest achievments. Many
high hopes are pinned on the Jazz Garden-
ers f o r the Inter - U n i v e r s i t i e s Compet-
i t i o n at Reading. Incidentally, a coaoh
i s being run to Reading on Wednesday 17th.
Feb., and a quick application to Mr.
Rushton may secure you a place.
