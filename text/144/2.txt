Aa Amerioa i s the apparent "leader"
of the western world, i t s sociological
problems are obwiously of interest and
importance t o i t s "followers."
Vance Paokard has just recently
brought out another book on American
sooiology. His f i r s t book, "The Hidden
Persuaders" dealt with his country's
methods of motivational advertising while
his second "THE STATUS SEEKERS," 21/-,
investigates American class behaviour.
There are, as sociologists have
discovered over the whole world, f i v e
d i s t i n c t i v e olasses i n Amerioa.
These are the Real Upper, Semi-Uppen
Limited Success, Working and Real Lower
olasses, with a notable cleavage between
the top two and the remaining three. This
cleavage, we are t o l d , i s almost e n t i r e l y
to do with eduoation. This, only
oollege graduates can hope to aohieve the
success required to p i t them i n the top
two olasses. Without the help of advanced
eduoation one i s l e f t struggling against
an insurmountable b a r r i e r .
American society i s also s t r a t i f i e d
on r a c i a l l i n e s . For instance, a torn
American Jew or Negro i s of much lower
status than a top B r i t i s h American.
So Amerioa, whioh i s thought t o be
the most olassless sooiety i n existenoe
i s , i t appears, as c l a s s conscious as
Great B r i t a i n was f i f t y years ago.
This country has been gradually
l o s i n g i t s c l a s s r i g i d i t y i n the present
century but i t i s s t i l l evident. I f
America influenoes B r i t a i n i n i t s attitude
to status as much as i n many other things
we s h a l l return to our o l d ways.
Paradoxioally, the upper classes i n
the United States tend to oopy old world
B r i t a i n . This stems from the faot that
the early B r i t i s h s e t t l e r s were of higher
class than the other s e t t l i n g nationals.
Thus, an upper olass Amerioan s t r i v i n g f o r
status w i l l buy a faded family p o r t r a i t
from an antique dealer and show i t to
guests aa "one of my B r i t i s h ancestors."
Coach lanterns on the gate-posts and o l d
f a u l t y window panes also give the r i g h t
impression to v i s i t o r s .
A q u i s i t i o n of antiques i s not the only
symbol of status. Another one, equally
as potent, i s wealth. This has been r e c -
ognised for Sissi time and i s shown by com-
p l e t e l y unnecessary gadgets, 3uoh as a i r
conditioning, 30 foot t e l e v i s i o n masts
and l a r g e r cars.
This olass s t r i v i n g has become so
apparent recently that advertisers are
spending a considerable amount of money
on research to f i n d out 'how to advertise
a produot to make i t desirable as a high
status symbol.
The main point, however, seems tu oe
that the author considers that lower olass
children do not have s u f f i c i e n t opportunity
for higher education and so the natural
talent of clever ohildren i n the lower
strata.goes to waste due t o the r i g i d i t y
of the class system. He considers that
a modern society cannot afford to tolerate
3uch waste.

Tn these stories he captures the
weaknesses and e c c e n t r i c i t i e s of his
characters displaying them with great
s k i l l i n scenes ranging from pathos i n
one extreme t o high comedy i n the other.
The themes are r e a l l y a pleasure to
f i n d : one, of a poor l i t t l e weakling of
a man whose l i f e i s disrupted by the
murder of a p r o s t i t u t e i n an adjacent
f l a t ; another of the b u l l f i g h t organised
to r a i s e money f o r the Spanish R.S.P.C.A.;
and yet another of the unhappy Czech
Amerioan wife, who t r i e s to solve her
problem of a f r i g i d husband with the
assistance of a T.V. p s y c h i a t r i s t .
Each story i n i t s e l f i s highly enter-
t a i n i n g and the complete product i s one
of the best books of short stories pub-
l i s h e d reoently.
The author i s a rraduate of Pennsyl-
vania State University and has a Masters
Degree from Columbia. He has worked
for a Boston newspaper, the Associated
Press and s everal magazines. He became
interested i n human behaviour early i n h i s
career and has published the two books
mentioned with great success. (The f i r s t
has already been translated i n t o nine
languages). He has been on several lecture
tours around Kurope and the U.S.A. and i s
an associate member of The Amerioan S o c i o l -
ogical Society.
Mr. Packard attacks the present
olass system i n Amerioa throughout) the book
and f i l l s i t f u l l of i n t r i g u i n g s o c i o l -
ogical d e t a i l s ranging from class attitudes
in sex behaviour to choosing a house. One,
however, i s constantly aware of the f a c t
that the author i s only t e l l i n g you about
the things whioh help h i s case. He e i t h e r
has t r i e d to colour his book with s l i g h t
sensatiosialism, always quoting the extremes
from his references, or he has tended to
discover only what he wants to disoover.
In either case, one oould go to Amerioa,
and not be able to f i n d a trace of those
things which he abhors .
The book i s w r i t t e n i n an easy s t y l e ,
far b e t t e r than his f i r s t book which was
a t r i f l e ponderous, and i f read with r e s -
ervation i s highly entertaining, inform-
a t i v e , and w e l l worth reading.

Up to the time of going to press
only three issues of the Evening Stan -
dard "University of London Special" have
been printed,, yet these and other columns
have been f i l l e d with tales of cabals,
Intrigues and the type of p o l i t i c a l man-
oeuvering that one gets used to i n Union
a f f a i r s . So f a r I have been disappointed
that the c r i t i c i s m s expressed by I.C.
students have missed the main point.
They are concerned with the faot that
l i t t l e mention has been made of I.C. A
glance at the issues w i l l show that
sooner or l a t e r we w i l l take our turn i n
the "College Close - ups" on the f i r s t
page. But to me the whole matter hinges
on whether the supplement i s directed to-
wards students or towards the public.
If the l a t t e r were the oase then
â€¢one of us oould have any serious
objection. But the course of events
seems to point to the former. In-
formation on the c i r c u l a t i o n and d i s t r -
ibution of the supplement seems to be
confused whioh does not surprise me i n
view ofthe nebulous and evasive answers
I received from a man who purported to
be i n charge of the d i s t r i b u t i o n depart-
ment. When I asked him whether the i s s -
ues were on sale i n places other than
the College Unions he r e p l i e d that some
were s o l d i n the West End. He refused
to give the proportions sold to students

Onoe again Felix has broken new
ground. As our f i r s t photograph shows,
our renowned Editor has reached the
bottom at last,accompanied by a l l the
Felix staff. Illuminated by a soft ned
light,Mike Barron worked late into the
night and with each, word the hole he has
dug for Felix sank deeper. At last,it
was ao deep that, only by climbing up a
lampost oould the bottom be seen. The
bottom has now disappeared along with s i i
members of the Felix staff and one dis-
gusted lampost. What Gad Brough is doing
no-one seems to know but hopes ran high
that he might be, joining the Foreign Leg-
ion; but unfortunately this was not so.
Tou,too,can come and work in the Felix
hole. Contact our renowned Editor,Mr. Trog-
lodyte Barron,Hole 123,Prinoe Consort Rd.

and to the p u b l i c Being already some-
what embarrassed by my questions he re-
erred, me to Berwick, the Assistant Ma
aging Director of the newspaper, wnof
brain c h i l d the supplement i s . He t.a
out and unobtainable.
It seems i n view of the reticence
of the Evening Standard that the schema
i s intended primarily to get more stud-
ents to buy copies, and not to provide ,
'
an informative and mature comment on the';!
U n i v e r s i t y f o r the general public. In jjf
t h i s case we must disagree with the ven-
ture. The premature decision already f
taken by The King's College Union i n
support of the supplement and of S p e l l -
man was motivated p r i m a r i l y no doubt by
the uninspired a r t i o l e i n the second
issue which featured them. I fear that
the spotlight directed suddenly upon
them has so dazzled them that they can-
not see the audience before whom they
stand - not a credulous public but t h e i r
own u n i v e r s i t y colleagues.
The Supplement i s soaroely a threat
to the college newspapers f o r I f e e l
that students w i l l quickly r e a l i z e i t s
worth. I t cannot hope to perform the
function of Sennet and i t adds nothing
to the University. Let's keep i t
outside the gates.
