ou know when you’ve said
a word so much it sounds
like gobbledegook? I’ve
said free speech so much
this week it’s lost all meaning.
When you all share that Guardian
‘Sorry we can’t ban everything that
offends you’ video on Facebook, all
your comments just read “FREEZE
PEACH” to me now.
Not that it’s not important. It’s
just other stuff is important. For
example, all of you thinking of
running for FELIX Editor: come
and see me! I can help you.Yes, you!
You can probably do it. I’ve been
thinking you could, and secretly
hoping you’d run. Anyway, I really
am the best person to ask. I can give
you advice and warnings, such as:
don’t bare your upper arms on Meet
the Candidates and then regret it
forever, and be prepared for people
to make GIFs of your less cute facial
expressions.
You don’t need to be a sabb
to invoke change. Fuck that!
Something that really interested me
this week was our feature into rent
strikes. Partly because I wrote it, but
I also spoke to some thoroughly rad

and proactive people at the UCL
rent strike who really had faith that
this kind of organised direct action
can work for others, because for
them it has. Last year, every student
in one halls of residence got a grand
back for their shitty housing. For
a university like ours, that, let’s
face it, can definitely afford to
run accommodation at a loss, and
to whom money is obviously so
important, an effective rent strike
isn’t as inconceivable as you might
think.If you think that college aren’t
listening to students through the
official channels, and to be honest,
they don’t have to, this is one thing
they would have to listen to. They
can’t pull academic sanctions on
you (illegal) and as a landlord with
some stake in the students’ welfare,
eviction seems unlikely. As long as
you have enough students unhappy
with prices who agree not to pay,
the rent strike will do itself. You
also need a phenomenally well-
organised campaign. UCL Cut the
Rent write their own press releases.
That’s one professional gang of
rebels.
You don’t necessarily have to go
to union council for weeks on end
to start something. Rise up! Listen
to me, sounding like a shit Les Mis.
It’s ‘love your union’ week, public
opinion in favour of the junior
doctors’ strike is at an all time high
and a lot of London universities are
looking into protesting against their
astronomically expensive halls.
The time is now, the place is
Imperial, and this Editorial is over
so the Editor can go for a little lie
down.
