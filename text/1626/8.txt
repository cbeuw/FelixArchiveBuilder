G
uerilla Science held
their V-Day event last
Monday at The Book
Club. The night titled
‘An Evening of Lust,Sex and Brains’
aimed at demonstrating how senses
and brains react when people meet
that special someone. Guests were
to undertake several challenges
based on scientific findings,all while
advertising their arousal, holding up
a ‘Turned off’or ‘Turned on’card,oh
and while blindfolded
The evening provided guests with
a range of challenges centred around
different sensory experiences.
Challenges such as the hearing and
smelling challenges, demonstrated
the effect of our senses on mate
selection, playing on the effect of a
complementary immune system on
our smell, or the appeal of a deeper
voice to women.
Overall a fun night, but some
googling could have saved guests
£20.
N
ature documentaries
often show the animal
kingdom to be a weird
and wonderful place,
but animal genitalia don’t usually
get the attention they rightfully
deserve. To right this wrong here’s
a list of five of the most bizarre bits
on offer out there.
Let’s start our titillating
exploration of the icky world of
animal sex in the exotic Down
Under, with nothing less than Oz’s
national animal: the Kangaroo.
Females have three vaginas. The
left and right vaginas carry sperm
to the two uteri at the top, whilst
the middle vagina delivers the
jellybean-sized joey from one of the
uteri to the mother’s pouch. This
arrangement also allows the female
kangaroo to be perpetually pregnant:
whilst one joey is developing inside
her pouch, another embryo can be
held in stasis, waiting for its sibling
to grow up and move out.
Vaginas, naturally, require penises
to perform their reproductive
function. And although some might
reassuringly claim that size doesn’t
matter, it’s clear that some species
have missed the memo. If you’re
smiling, though thinking of the
sperm whale when envisioning the
biggest penis out there, wipe that
smile off your face. It is in fact the
banal beach barnacle that has the
biggest willy (relative to body size)
of the animal kingdom. Somewhere
between eight and 40 times the
length of their body.
Of course you don’t strictly have to
be male to sport a penis; take hyenas
for example. Being aggressive is
useful within the hyena community
and the feistier the mother is, the
more androgen, a male sex hormone
linked to aggression, she passes to
her young. Female hyenas with a
lot of androgen develop clitorises
that can be up to 7 inches long,
so lengthy it’s often mistaken for
a penis. During birth the clitoris
becomes the birth canal for a cub to
squeeze its way through. Yikes.
Speaking of willies, male
ducks have one that’s long and
anticlockwise spiralling. When
it’s flaccid it’s tightly coiled, but as
soon as it enters a vagina it becomes
erect within a third of a second with
ejaculationhappeningjustasquickly.
Males often force themselves upon
females and reports of duck gang
rape are quite common so female
ducks have evolved vaginas that
trick the males. Their vaginas are
filled with trick openings so if she
doesn’t want to have sex she can
direct the male to ejaculate in a
dead-end but when she does, she
can relax internal muscles to make
sex easier.
But most likely, the prize for
weirdest penis goes to the Echidna,
known also as the spiny anteater.
This strange looking member of the
monotremi, has an even stranger
looking member consisting of one
shaft with four heads. Each time
it has sex, two of these heads shut
down and release sperm into the
female’s two-branched vagina and
alternates heads the next time it
copulates.

Forests as carbon source, not carbon sink
A
key component in the
fight against climate
change has been the
idea of controlled
and regulated reforestation in
regions destroyed by human
actions. However, a recent study
suggests that forests regrowing in
Europe after mass deforestation
between the 18th
and 19th
century
are actually contributing to global
warming rather than helping to
reverse it; despite the fact they are
10% larger than the pre-industrial
revolution woodlands. This poses
a real problem for those hoping to
reverse the effects of climate change
via reforestation, with over 85% of
modern European forests regulated
by human management.
Researchers from the Laboratory
of Climate Science and
Environment in France, recreated
the last 260 years of human forest
management through computer
modelling; taking into account,
biodiversity, harvesting methods,
and background temperature
fluctuations. The results suggested
that in the 260 years, up to 2010,
the addition of 200,000 km2
to
woodland in Europe led to a

temperature increase of 0.12°C.This
number on its own may not seem
that significant, but the researchers
have said that the increase in
temperature equates to about 6% of
the global warming attributed to the
burning of fossil fuels. According to
the study’s leader Dr Kim Naudts,
“Even well managed forests today
store less carbon than their natural
counterparts in 1750”. Hence, this
study calls into question how well
we understand our ability to combat
climate change as a global issue.
The paper argues that the key
issue with the forests under
human management is the change
in species composition, relative
to a composition which would
otherwise naturally occur. More and
more forest managers have chosen
to replant trees that are proven to be
fast growing and highly profitable
to make any projects sustainable.
However, trees that fit such specific
criteria, such as Pine and Spruce,
absorb more heat than native and
previously abundant deciduous
species, such as Oak or Birch;
meaning more energy is retained in
our atmosphere,warming the planet.
Additionally, these conifer species
release less cooling water into the
atmosphere, which affects both the
localecosystemandthewiderregion.
These two factors caused a 0.08%

increase in temperature, along with
other contributing factors such as
commercial harvesting.
The idea that reforestation and,
more generally,creating mass carbon
sinks is the most effective way to
combat climate change has been
challenged before. A 1992 study
in Nature presented data showing
that expanded forest regions in the
upper northern hemisphere could
be detrimental as those regions
tended to be snow covered for large
sections of the year. It was found
that snow, even if present only
seasonally, reflected more energy
than the conifer trees could.These
findings may be only strictly related
to European reforestation projects,
since the results are so closely linked
to the history of the continent. On
the other hand, this process of
mass deforestation and managed
replanting isn’t exclusive to these
regions alone, so conservation
groups worldwide will need
understand this situation in order
not to make the same mistakes.
