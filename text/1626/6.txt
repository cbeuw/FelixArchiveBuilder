COMMENT
The union lost the plot and free speech suffered
If FemSoc say it wasn’t sexist, were the union’s actions justified?

ere’s a picture of
Malaysian PM Najib
Razak. Malaysian
police responded to
this image by warning the author
that the image was ‘offensive’. They
then threatened that if he didn’t
‘act within the law’, he would be
arrested.
This, of course, had nothing to do
with the fact that someone rich and
powerful decided they didn’t like
looking the clown.
Of course, no such autocratic
response to criticism would
cross the minds of our very own
democratically elected leaders here
at Imperial.
Instead, when one is the Union
President and faced with a critical
article, the union merely “strongly
advises” that it be removed from
print. Then, oddly enough, one’s
subjects (or, students?) are told that
continuing to distribute the article
is “elevated harassment”. Right.
There’s a lot more at stake here
than Lucinda’s blushes.
This ‘ban’ is yet another example
of college and the union interfering
with the right of students and staff to
comment and criticise. Freedom of
expression isn’t without restrictions.
But I doubt that anyone who reads
Private Eye (never mind Hangman)
would be in the least surprised at
I doubt that

who reads
Private Eye
would be
in the least
surprised
at the style
of RAG’s
publication
Protecting
this right of
expression
is a legal
obligation
the style of RAG’s publication.
In fact, it seems much more likely
that the Union’s treatment of RAG
broke its own policy in its treatment
of RAG than in anything RAG
wrote about the union.
For the body charged with
safeguarding and protecting us
as students, this is shameful.
For starters, there’s the legal
gobbledygook coming out of
Beit. To quote their own policy:
“Harassment is always linked to
anti discrimination legislation,
and thus will focus on sex, gender
reassignment, marriage”.
These are known as protected
characteristics. Unless the union
can prove that the President was
specifically targeted for abuse due
to one of these, the accusation of
harassment is completely baseless.
i.e. apparently the union thinks
the RAG article sexist. Was it?
Having read said article, and given
the treatment handed out to a ‘Fen
Bernando’, this claim is utter trash.
To quote IC FemSoc in full:
“Though we can’t comment on other
aspects of the article, the committee
of ICFemSoc (which does not
necessarily represent the opinions
of all it’s members, or all feminists)
does not believe the article in itself
is sexist”.
In short, the case for the union
behaving as it did is shot. As a
source close to RAG commented:
“They just didn’t follow their own
rules”. Truly, Ms. Sandon-Allum,
I find it ‘unacceptably insulting’
that someone within your union’s
management thought they could
get away with it.
Thebasicquestionisthis.Ifthecase
for the article being harassing is so
flimsy, on what basis exactly did the
union go around hauling students
into meetings, demanding apologies
and generally applying pressure?
These underhand, opaque tactics of
‘banning-but-not-banning’reek of a
culture of political face-saving over
democratic principle.
Perhaps Ms. Sandon-Allum and
team simply haven’t read their own
policy.
“Bullying: The exercise of power
over another person through
persistent,negative acts or behaviour
that undermines an individual
personally and/or professionally.”
Despite this wacko logic,President
A. Gast went so far as to call the
article in question ‘disgusting’ and
warmly welcomed the above ‘strong’
response.
By apple pie and eagles, it
staggers me that anyone can be
paid £421,000 a year, and yet be
seemingly so unaware of her own
obligations. To quote the Imperial
College Constitution:
“So far as is reasonably practical,
freedom of speech within the law
will be secured for students and staff
of the college.”
This isn’t a luxury. Protecting
this right of expression is a legal
obligation on the college and it’s
leaders (have a read of the Education
Reform Act 1988 or Education Act
No. 2, 1986).
Professor, since when has it
been ‘strong’ to be so blasé about
academic freedom?
The problem with constitutions is
that they are only as good as their
defenders. Take the Malaysian
example. Article 10 of the
constitution begins: “Every citizen
has the right to freedom of speech
and expression”. Despite this, PM
Razak has used the Sedition Act
over 91 times this year. This is a
1948 act, designed with the express
purpose of preventing revolt against
British rule. Article 3a) reads: “It is
an offence to bring into hatred or
contempt or to excite disaffection
against any Ruler or against any
Government”.
Is it seditious of me to wonder
exactly what the difference is
between our dear old Imperial
Union’s position and the colonialists
of yesteryear?
The biggest ‘discredit to the
college’s legacy’ from this farce is
that the words of President Gast
and the behaviour of ICU sets
a precedent that fundamentally
threatens the scientific integrity of
the college.
Scientific integrity does not
just stop at the lab door. It is the
fundamental principle that there
is no topic too hard or painful that
we don’t have a right to discuss and
examine. If we lose that as a college,
we’re dead.
Truth is, the union has not had
it too tough, but too easy. As one
student commented on a recent
FELIX article: “the Sabbs are so
unaccountable for their (lack of)
actions.”
That’s got to change.
