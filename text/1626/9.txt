A fantastic display of failed potential

The cast of Battlefield at the Young Vic Photo: Simon Annand
I
really wanted to like Battlefield.
Usually, a statement like
this foreshadows ruthless
panning and heartless
criticism, especially when it makes
an appearance at the beginning
of a review. But I shall try and be
objective.
Battlefield is essentially a retelling
The Young Vic presents an inspiring but shallow take on a Hindu classic
comparable to the Bible, Qur’an,
or the works of Shakespeare and
Homer.
Let me get it out of the way:
Battlefield is a great production. The
Young Vic itself is a remarkable
venue, “bustling and unorthodox”
and “South London’s glorious
temple of leftfield theatre”. It ticks
all the boxes – fancy bar (nutritious
spring water on tap), a simple,
minimalistic black box layout.
It’s is worth a visit; few places are
as brimming with energy. Their
productions are top-notch,and great
credit has to be given to whoever it
is who oils the cogs and wheels in
this machine. Seats are worth their
price, things start and end on time,
and there are no backstage brawls
between stage-hands and makeup
artists.
Secondly, Battlefield is superbly
acted. McNeill makes a great,
relatable everyman of the demigod-
like protagonist, Yudishtira.
Karemera was great as the female
lead,Yudishtira’s mother,an absolute
paragon of all that is motherly and
matronly, equal parts nurturing
and authoritative. I cannot leave
out her poise, her grace, and how
superlatively she conveys a sense
of quiet fortitude with her sheer
body language. O’Callaghan is the
real stand out though; his primary
role as the blind king, the father of
a hundred dead men, is deliciously
realised with almost Grecian pathos.
Finally, Nzaramba plays Krishna,
one of the most revered characters
in the mythology, whose very
essence is his virtuosity, authority
and godlike status. Nzaramba is a
very,very good actor – with a superb
command of expression, intonation,
and subtle inflections that he
uses to his advantage to create an
entertaining performance. But as to
how far he embodies the properties
of his character, I am not sure.
Well, this is the entire cast – sparse,
nuclear, four-person. And at the
helm of it is Marie-Hélène Estienne
and the legendary Peter Brook
himself (whose first production of
the play ran for a bladder-boggling
nine hours).
However, I was less than
impressed with Battlefield. I’d
definitely say that it falls short of its
lofty ambitions, or even cast doubts
on the loftiness of those ambitions.
The biggest disappointment was the
writing – how much more this play
could be! The script barely addressed
the central plot or, indeed, the most
pervasive theme in the source
material – namely, war. It was as
though one had adapted Sun Tzu’s
The Art of War and focused entirely
on terrain analysis and taxation.
It’s not that I demand blood and
violence on stage. It’s that one of
the central efforts of the source text
is a meditation on conflict and the
moral philosophy of justice, killing,
and warfare. And instead of this, we
are treated to a bunch of fables about
snakes, pigeons, falcons, worms,
and mongooses. One gets the
feeling that the makers of this play
abandoned the deeper points made
by the work to focus on throwing
together a bunch of colourful, exotic
parables that would conjure up the
peculiar allure of the ‘mysterious
East’. What of the interesting
character dynamics, the incredibly
potent plot, the ruminations on
duty, responsibility, and ethics?
Instead, we get a funny story about
a worm that doesn’t want to die. It
is as though a Homerian plot were
condensed into a series of Aesop’s
fables.
In this way I felt as though
the source material was terribly
underused. As W.J. Johnson says,
this is a text with equivalent literary
value and emotive force as the
Greek tragedies,or of Shakespeare’s.
How it would have benefited from a
similar treatment! If only the writers
and directors had the courage to
delve into the deep melancholy of
it all, the heightened drama, the
nuances of plot and language – the
beautiful writing is all there! But
the effect of a potent scene is too
often quelled by a visual gag in the
following moments.
And this was the other thing –
only too frequently a decidedly
somber moment in the story
would incite uproarious laughter –
something that would be entirely
jarring and out-of-place in a serious
Shakespearean tragedy, which is
essentially what the source material

A retelling

of the epic poem, Mahabharata,
something of a cornerstone of
Hindu mythology. The poem is one
of the oldest works of literature in
recorded history; bits of it date to
before the origins of London some
two-and-a-half millennia ago. It
is by far the longest literary work,
a whole order of magnitude above
the Illiad and Odyssey combined.
It is also a text of considerable
importance – historians (notably,
W.J. Johnson et al.) argue that it is

is, at least much more than it is a
comedy sketch. Maybe my only
fault is that I have read it.
But let us not dwell on what could
be. What is, is a delightful, comical,
entertaining play, to anyone who
sees it with fresh eyes. If you have
read the source material, however,
then you might be disappointed at
how poorly-realised its potential is.
The visual legacy of space exploration

T
he latest offering
from the Natural
History Museum is a
photography exhibition
titled Otherworlds. Like all great
collections of art, it aims to
intrigue the intellect as well as stir
the emotions. In its own words,
Otherworlds aims no less than to
“embod[y] the symbiosis between
even the chance image by an ancient
camera can be possibly the most
beautiful photograph ever taken.
We start off our journey on Earth,
which, as you would imagine, is the
most natural place for lift-off. The
viewer is encouraged to meditate
on terrestrial vistas – the gorgeous
specular reflection off the Caribbean
sea, the vast spread of Mexico’s
Yucatan peninsula. Across the
latter a fire rages – a result of slash-
and-burn deforestation. “Signs of
human intervention can be seen
even from very high orbits,” the
label describes. On one hand, it is a
grossly embarrassing realisation. On
the other, it is a relief – one has to
only travel a little bit further before
the views are no longer marred by
mankind’s folly.
We are then treated to the
moon, paired against the Earth,
photographed in 1967. A year later,
humans would witness earthrise for
the first time, during the Apollo 8
mission. Only a few years later, we
made our last trip – since 1972, no
human being has ever left low Earth
orbit.
And the Sun is next! A seething,
pulsing, billowing, boiling ball of
red, white and orange, against a
featureless black backdrop. On its
quietest days, the panel describes,
the Sun is “sobering”; when in a
more volatile mood, it is “downright
terrifying”. There is a great macabre
beauty to the ball of fire, almost
Lovecraftian – it’s no surprise that
those of creative persuasion are
drawn to it. There are at least three
young artists sitting and sketching,
and one child has been fixated by it
ever since I walked in.
Mercury, Venus and Mars are
their usual hostile selves. However,
beauty rears its unexpected head
in all the starkness – the way
sunlight bounces around Mercury’s
tumultuous topography creates a
softer day-night divide that we see
on Earth, and Mars’s global dust
storms shroud its giant canyons in a
veil of red. Speaking of Mars, there
is a picture of Curiosity looking
back on its tracks, and it is poignant
because it’s almost a metaphor
for humans looking back at their
footprints – which one wishes we
did half as often as rovers do.
Leaving human footprints
behind, we arrive at the gas giants
– Jupiter, its stormy self, and Saturn
profoundly affecting with its
graceful, almost perfectly geometric
form. If Jupiter is the roman God of
sky and thunder, Saturn is a ballet
dancer with hula hoops. The rings
reflect so much light onto Saturn’s
night side that there “a perpetual
twilight lingers”. Ultimately, the gas
giants are outshined by their moons
– particularly beautiful is a picture
of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons
(and not a Mexican appetiser)
which erupts a vast spray of water
into space that immediately freezes
into a column of ice.
The photos of the outer planets are
among the most remote views ever
witnessed by Man.They appear cold
and distant, but even they too have
an unexpected side to them. Last
year, we flew by Pluto for the first
time – and what we discovered was
that the dwarf planet’s atmosphere,
backlit by the sun, was as blue as
earthly skies. One wonders if the
grass, too, is greener, on the far
side of the solar system. It is a lot
to take in. One gets a sense that the
planets are dynamic,graceful things,
rather than featureless hunks of
rock. Often, heavenly bodies are just
specks in the sky,but in Otherworlds,
these dots in the firmament become
living, breathing entities, colourful,
commanding, awesome, awe-
inspiring – they are, almost literally,
the biggest and most pristine
spectacles that could ever be viewed.
And here they’ve captured them on
camera.

And reveal this it does. Unlike
with most photographic exhibitions,
the puppeteer of our heartstrings
is, in this case, not human beings
but machines – machines named
Rosetta, Lunar Orbiter, Magellan,
Viking Orbiter, and Curiosity,
among others. They are the probes
and robotic spacecraft that wind
their weary path around the cosmos,
ceaseless, untrammelled by friction
and resistance in ways that most
human photographers can never be.
They are the farthest manifestations
of our eyes, and indeed, most
remote incarnations of the human
observer. The images they obtain
are random, largely unguided, and
yet those are the images that most
move us. It’s funny – we are so
used to the terrestrial terrain that it
takes a skilled eye and an artist of
great creativity to inspire us with
the everyday sights around us; not
everyone can be a photographer on
Earth. But these cosmic subjects,
so perfect are they in their form,
movement, and composition that
