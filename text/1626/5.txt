Your President speaks on RAG mag ‘sexism’
RAG has gone too far, and should take responsibility for putting women off taking on
positions of responsibility

W
ho’s to blame for the
gender imbalance
at Imperial, and
in science and
leadership in general? “Not me”,
you’re thinking. For the vast
majority of you, that’s correct. But
a tiny proportion of our community
fails to recognise their role in
creating that awful reality.
The institutional culture
surrounding gender at Imperial is
not an inevitable fact of life. It is
created, and sustained, by people
around you, right here, right now. In
the same way that no one raindrop
considers itself responsible for the
flood, no one person considers
themselves responsible for the fact
that Imperial can be, on occasion, a
hostile environment for women.
No one
raindrop
considers
itself
responsible
for the
flood
But sometimes, it becomes
possible to pinpoint a single action
or incident that perpetuates this
reality. I can say with complete
confidence that the actions of the
RAG committee in publishing the
RAG mag with offensive content,
based on tired stereotypes about
women and drawing upon aspects
of my personal life, has directly
led to women deciding against
taking up leadership roles in our
student community. I know this
because students that have been
considering a future as Union
President or one of our Deputy
Presidents have now seen how a
tiny minority of our students act.
It’s clear that some individuals think
that tradition justifies bullying, or
that it’s somehow acceptable not
to challenge your peers about what
they say or do, or to refuse to take
personal responsibility.
These actions have led to a female
student withdrawing their run for
a position of leadership, for fear of
being subjected to the same abuse.If
this is the way a few loud voices treat
a woman in leadership, via trollish
stereotyping and personal attacks, it
is not a surprise that other female
students have been discouraged
from aiming for a leadership
position. And so, Imperial’s gender
imbalance lives on for another year.
Being an adult is about taking
responsibility for the consequences
of your actions, and the individuals
involved in writing that piece need
to accept what they have done
and the impact they have had.
As students we all have a duty of
responsibility and mutual respect.
If these values are not upheld and
boundaries are crossed, the people
accountable must confront their
unacceptable behaviour.
Every student is entitled to speak
freely, but the RAG mag is an
attack on this. Freedom of speech
does not equate to freedom from
consequences. This is an issue the
FELIX editor tackled herself in her
editorial on the 29th
of January.
By condemning the article,
Imperial College Union is in
no way preventing RAG from
raising money. As a previous RAG
committee member and a huge
supporter of the society I want them
to be as successful as possible.
However, we want RAG week
to be a success, not a scandal. It is
perverse to argue that raising money
can only be successful by being cruel
and ‘joking’ about natural tragedies.
RAG week charities support victims
of ill health, war and poverty. One
charity, Porridge and Rice, works to
empower Kenyan women to break
free from the cycle of poverty – a
worthy goal, undermined by using
sexist stereotypes as publicity for
fundraising.
The RAG mag writers must take
full responsibility for the reduced
publicity they have caused for
this week of fundraising. They
have potentially discouraged
participation, donations and
sponsorship by tarnishing RAG as
a group that permits and enables
bullying.
We must stop this culture that
accepts bullying, accepts fewer
women leaders, and dresses up
personal attacks as ‘tradition’ or
‘satire’. It is not acceptable for
an article to be written to target
an individual’s personal life, and
even more so depicting someone’s
murder.
I know that the majority of
Imperial students have no time for
bullying, tasteless personal attacks,
and gendered stereotypes masked
as ‘banter’. I am and will always
be proud of the work I’ve done
as Union President to encourage
young women to study science and
to take the challenge of leadership.
I would love to say that equality
can solely be achieved through
outreach projects and publicity, but
they are only half the battle. The
deeper challenge is to confront and
uproot prejudices and structures
that support and enable gendered
attacks on women - even, or
especially, when disguised as ‘banter’
or ‘tradition’. It is just cold, hard
reality that the path to equality
is blocked by damaging habits,
ingrained prejudices, corrosive
behaviours and plain old bullying
and harassment.
I am grateful for the support I
have received - from President Alice
Gast to student groups,societies and
staff,all appalled by the behaviour of
these few individuals. Together, we
will stand up to sexism and bullying
wherever we see it.
The RAG
mag writers
must
take full
responsibility
for the
reduced
publicity
