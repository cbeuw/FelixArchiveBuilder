I
n this week’s FELIX, the
Union President has spoken
out on last week’s RAG mag
controversy. Contents of the
magazine, although technically
not banned, caused the union to
strongly advise RAG to dispose of
the 1600 undistributed copies after
the union had seen the contents.
One page in particular was said to
be “beyond the acceptable bounds of
satire or mockery” and that further
distribution would be considered
“elevated harassment”.
In her comment piece, Lucinda
accuses the writers of “unacceptable
behaviour”, “bullying” and “personal
attacks”. Stating that she believed
the piece to be sexist in outcome, if
not in motivation.
However, Imperial College
Union’s own feminist society have
said that they do not believe the
piece was sexist. In a statement
to FELIX a representative said:
“Though we can’t comment on other
aspects of the article, the committee
of ICFemSoc (which does not
necessarily represent the opinions
of all its members, or all feminists)
does not believe the article in itself
is sexist”.
Last week, the union promised
RAG a reprinted magazine for
free, providing the offending page
was replaced with a Leadership
Elections advert. On Saturday,
RAG’s Facebook page was
promising a new digital version of
the magazine, but by Tuesday, there
was still no new flyer, either printed
or digital. On Wednesday, the union
paid for the print of double-sided
A5 cards advertising RAG’s few
remaining events, rather than a
reprinted magazine as promised.
Despite being near the end of RAG
week, volunteers distributed the
new ‘magazines’ around campus.
The non-ban has ironically given
the RAG mag more attention than
they could’ve hoped for and the
comment section under FELIX’s
online news piece on the matter is
full of people asking where they can
get their hands on the contraband
reading material. Several
commenters lament what they call
the union’s “attack on free speech”,
with one only saddened at the fact
that the mag was “really unfunny
and gives satire a bad name”.
This wasn’t the only problem RAG
faced this week. As Storm Imogen
battered the UK on Tuesday, it
was deemed too windy for their
fundraising bungee jump to take
place.
Despite harsh words from
Imperial President, Alice Gast, on
the contents of the controversial
magazine, senior college
management still aided with
pancake making on Monday, as is
tradition. Other RAG events have
continued this week without a
hitch: the RAG ball at Cafe de Paris
on Tuesday, a 24-hour broadcast
on IC Radio that raised £165, and
Queen’s Tower and underground
tunnel tours.

...led to “a situation which has
been unprecedented in my lifetime”.
On Wednesday, junior doctors
took part in a 24 hour strike, with
junior doctors only providing
emergency care. Up to 3000
operations were cancelled but
public opinion of the junior doctors
remains mostly favourable.
On Saturday hundreds of junior
doctors, medical students and
supporters joined a ‘silent’ march.
The protesters sat down in the road
outside Downing Street, many
wearing surgical masks.
Fashion designer Vivien
Westwood and actress Vanessa
Redgrave spoke passionately about
their experiences with NHS staff at
the event.
The next day, Health Secretary,
Jeremy Hunt, appeared on the
BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show and
blamed the media and the BMA for
the anger amongst junior doctors at
the potential contract changes.
He also specifically accused the
BMA of distorting his words,which
he called “one of the cleverest trade
unions in the book”.
A
PhD student from
Imperial has led a
team from the Aerial
Robotics Lab to victory
in a competition to find ‘Drones for
Good’ in Dubai.
Talib Alhinai’s winning entry is a
prototype that can detect faults in
pipelines and then deposit a liquid
polyurethane foam to seal them.The
foam is lightweight and can expand
up to 25 times its original size after
being applied to damaged pipes.
Leaks from pipelines cause all sorts
of problems throughout the world,
with as much of 25% of drinking
water being lost due to leaks. Dubai
loses about 10% of its water in this
way, so the judges took a particular
interest in this entry.
The competition involved national
and international awards, with
Imperial’s ‘Buildrone’ taking the
national prize.The Imperial winners
were personally congratulated by the
ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed
Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
The prize was a million Arab
Emirates Dirhams, or about
£190,000. They say they’ll be
channeling this money back into
the project, in an effort to make it
more user friendly.
