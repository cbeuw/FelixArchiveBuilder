FILM
I
can remember learning about
the Hollywood blacklist in
my GCSE history class; a
paranoid electorate, whipped
into a state of frenzy by senator
Joseph McCarthy, pilloried a group
of film actors, directors, and writers
for their left-leaning tendencies.
And that was all it was for us: a note
on the past, sandwiched between
the Truman Doctrine and the
sultry summer of the Rosenbergs’
execution. But of course, for those
involved, for their family and
friends, for the whole industry,
that was far from it; director Jay
Roach seeks to rectify this in his
film Trumbo – focusing on a single
individual (in this case Dalton
Trumbo, the screenwriter of Roman
Holiday, Exodus, and Spartacus),
the film invites us to observe the
catastrophic effects the blacklist had
on an entire generation of creatives.
Bryan Cranston is the titular
Trumbo, and while – fresh from his
stratospheric success in Breaking
Bad – he provides the film with
a certain amount of gravitas, his
character really seems to amount
to little more than a collection of
mannerisms. Cranston’s Trumbo
clutches his trademark cigarette
holder, spends hours in the bath
scribbling, and responds to every
change in situation with the same
pained/confused face; he delivers
his lines in a tone that reminds me
most of Daniel Day-Lewis’oil baron
in There Will Be Blood – strained,
dignified, charismatic.
The overall effect is that everything
Cranston says seems to take on an
air of gravitas, making his Trumbo
seem less like a human being and
more like rhetoric given a human
form. It is perhaps unsurprising that
Cranston’s performance is so broad,
given Roach’s most famous work is
the Austin Powers trilogy. At one
point, his friend and fellow writer
Arlen Hird (a composite character,
played very well by Louis C.K.)
snaps at him: ‘Jesus, do you ever
say anything that isn’t gonna get
chiseled on a rock?’– a fair question.
But then perhaps the fault
lies – ironically enough – with
screenwriter John McNamara. The
script is solid,but not anything really
special. It hits all the points along
the story arc, giving us the requisite
initial setbacks, betrayal from a
friend, an emotional crisis (where
Trumbo’s guilt seems to be absolved
by him spending his cash), and an
eventual, inevitable conclusion. Cue
credits and archival footage.
Cranston has a fair amount of
backup power in the supporting
cast: Diane Lane delivers the most
nuanced performance of the film
as Trumbo’s long-suffering wife;
Elle Fanning puts in a great turn
as Trumbo’s fiery teenage daughter,
who is more concerned with the
passing of the Voting Rights Act
than her father’s scriptwriting;
and Michael Stuhlbarg does an
adequate impression of actor
Helen Mirren in full-on mad hat mode, opposite the strained Bryan Cranston in Trumbo. Photo Credit: YouTube/Entertainment One

Perfunctory historical piece without pizzazz
Turgid Trumbo fails to shine, despite the best efforts of Bryan Cranston
Edward G. Robinson (although,
after his exceptional performance
in A Serious Man, all I really want
is for Stuhlbarg to get more film
time in any role). Helen Mirren,
placed front and center in all the
advertising campaigns for the film,
has little more than a bit role in
gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper;
it’s all mad hats, panto-dame style
barbs, and rampant anti-semitism,
and – ultimately – she really isn’t
that good.
The film is stolen, however, by
John Goodman, who puts in a
barnstorming performance as Frank
King,a B-list producer who takes on
scripts written by Trumbo in secret;
Goodman has some of the best
scenes of the film, and runs with
them, culminating in one where
he is threatened with shutdown
if he doesn’t fire Trumbo. ‘I make
garbage!’ he screams, smashing a
baseball bat into the space that
seconds before was filled with a
man’s head; ‘wanna call me a pinko
in the papers? Do it! Nobody who
goes to my movies can fucking read.’
But it turns out Goodman’s
performance is the high spot of
an otherwise flaccid piece of work.
While overall the cast put in a
solid (if uneven) effort into their
roles, there is a sense in which the
film doesn’t really come together.
Perhaps it’s the script, which flies
through 15 years of tumultuous
history at a speed which would
give you whiplash; or maybe
it’s the direction, which is done
perfunctorily and without panache;
or perhaps it’s the cinematography,
and the bizarre lighting style
which sees everyone brightly
illuminated from the front. In some
respects, this film reminded me of
Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies, another
film about one man facing down
rabid, commie-fearing America; but
that film was produced with oodles
of style, making it a masterful
oil painting in comparison with
Trumbo’s colour-by-number.
A
beautifully shot movie,
enhanced by the location
of a secluded valley in
Iceland, Rams is a story
about family – which here includes
sheep.
The story revolves around two
estranged brothers Gudmundur
(Gummi) and Kristinn (Kiddi)
Bodvarsson, who have not spoken
a word to each other for 40 years.
All their correspondences are
conveyed through a messenger
sheep-dog; it helps that they are,
in fact, neighbours. After narrowly
losing to his brother at the yearly
ram competition, fueled by jealousy,
Gummi becomes convinced his
brother’s sheep is infected with
scrapie, a degenerative disease
affecting goats and sheep. After
his thoughts are confirmed, the
implications sink in: a death
sentence for all the valley’s sheep,
including his own. Slaughtering
their ancestral prize winning flock
and allowing the Bostatur breed
to become extinct is not on either
brother’s agenda, and they go about
trying fight the inevitable in their
own way.
Winner of the Un Certain
Regard Prize at Cannes in 2015,
Rams was Iceland’s entry for the
2016 Oscars for the Best Foreign
Film category. Shot in a secluded
Icelandic valley, the film has no
shortages of scenic vistas.The use of
long still shots frames the isolation

of the characters both physically
and mentally, and conveys to the
audience the impact losing their
sheep would have. A haunting
score by Atli Örvarsson perfectly
complements these shots to create
a sense of extreme loneliness. The
relationship between the men and
their flock is shown to be one of
family – if not more than family – as
it is only at the possibility of losing
their sheep that the brothers even
decide to communicate. As the film
progresses, we see the relationship
between the two brothers change
and evolve, as they are faced with
a common goal of securing their
ancestral flock.
With strong and subdued
performances from both the leads
Sigurður Sigurjónsson (who was
in the music video for ‘Crystals’ by
Icelandic band Of Monsters and
Men) and Theódór Júlíusson, you
feel as attached to the sheep as the
brothers, especially in the lead up to
the final shot. As they movie ends
L
egally Blonde is a decent
enough film, and I
appreciate the effort of
the filmmakers to create
a stereotype-defying and intelligent
female lead. However, the fact
remains that Woods only gets into
law school because the admissions
officer fancies her, and her big
show of intelligence at the end of
the film has nothing to do with
any knowledge of complex law. I’ll
take any of these badasses over Ms.
Woods:
Ripley - Alien
Academics are absolutely obsessed
with Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic.
Full books have been written about
its themes, which range from the
fears of modern society,to Marxism,
to representations of pregnancy
(phallic imagery guys, phallic
imagery everywhere). Sigourney
Weaver plays Ripley who the
author Judith Newton perfectly says
‘appropriates qualities traditionally
identified with male, but not
masculinist, heroes.’
Éowyn – Lord of the Rings
The nature of Tolkien’s insanely
intricate world of Middle Earth
makes my argument here rather
difficult. Fortunately I only need
one quote to make my case. During
the Battle of Pelennor Fields,
Éowyn confronts the Witch King
of Angmar who boasts “You fool!
No man can kill me! Die now.”
Éowyn retorts, “I am no man.”, and
deals a killing blow. Ouch.
Chihiro – Spirited Away
The Bechdel test describes
whether a film contains at least two
named women who talk to each
other about something other than
a man. Despite a worrying number
of films today failing this test I
cannot think of a single Miyazaki
film which could be included
amongst them: Chihiro is only one
of his many inspiring and maturely-
written female characters. She may
not be perfect, but her realism
makes her relatable and wonderful.

we are left wondering what the
brothers were really looking for:
to save the sheep? or to save each
other?
MERYL ANIL
the US director/actor, serves as a
good companion piece to Hopper’s
films, showing him when he was
at his most well-known, following
the runaway success of Easy Rider.
Fans of Hopper, however, may have
to look away, lest they dislike what
they see on screen.
Hopper is an abrasive personality,
the American counter-culture
personified. Talking about why
he wanted to make Easy Rider, he
talks about turning a mirror on the
‘society of criminals’ that make up
the powerful of America; however,
for each interesting aphorism
offered by Hopper there are two
more that grate, such as his take on
literacy: ‘I don’t believe in reading.’
Watching this 1971 piece back
now, it is perhaps unfair to judge
Hopper in the cold light of modern
standards. Still, he comes across as
irritating,half-crazed,and lecherous
– not a good combination.
We catch Hopper in the middle
of making The Last Movie; following
on from the success of Easy Rider,
Hopper was given carte-blanche
to make whatever he wanted, and
the result was – unsurprisingly
– a jarring piece of work, wholly
experimental in tone. He would not
direct again for another ten years.
The American Dreamer is somewhat
similar, making use of sharp jump
cuts and experimental interludes
in a way unassociated with most
documentary features. The result is
a beguiling, engrossing work that,
although showing Hopper in an
unflattering light, seems completely
honest about the director’s inner
life.
