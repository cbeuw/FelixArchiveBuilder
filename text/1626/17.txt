W
hen it was
announced that
the BBC would be
producing another
adaptation of Tolstoy’s epic tome,
I, like many others, was intrigued.
Then came the news that veteran
showrunner Andrew Davies, who
has written or produced for the likes
of everything from Bridget Jones to
Pride and Prejudice, would be the
guiding hand. This split people into
mainly two camps; those who, like
me, were reassured, and others who
felt this was an affront to Tolstoy’s
spirit. These purists believed that
Davies would use this as nothing
but an excuse to give us a sexed-
up traipse through the 19th
century
glitterati. They weren’t entirely
wrong. But, in his defence, the show
runner only does this by showing us
directly some of the subtext of the
novel; subtext that Tolstoy did not
elucidate himself only because the
social trappings of his era did not
let him.
If you’re not familiar with this
behemoth of fiction, War and
Peace follows five families from the
aristocracy of 19th
century Russia.
We follow the lives and struggles of
these people on the eve of Russia’s
war with Napoleon and through the
following years.
Another area of concern,one more
justified, was the compact length
of the adaptation. Six episodes is
dangerously thin space to cover the
monolithic text.As such,the success
of this adaptation depended greatly
on the calibre of the actors within
it, and their capability to impart
Tolstoy’s complexities to us through
their emotion. I’m pleased to say
that, in this regard, the production
succeeds admirably.
Whoever did the casting deserves
a bonus. Paul Dano is pitch-perfect
as the hapless Pierre Bezhukhov,
doing that typical Paul Dano
thing of looking and acting like a
lost puppy. Lily James also shines
here, surprising with her range
and evocativeness as the innocent
Natasha Rostova. I liked her just
fine in Downton, but she really
didn’t get this kind of opportunity
to flex her acting muscles there.This
performance has got me hyped for
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
The real revelation,however,is Jessie
Buckley as the ever beleaguered
Marya Bolkonkaya. She manages to
convey immaculately the character’s
tight-rope walk between reserved
strength and deep sadness. If there’s
any weak link here it’s Jack Lowden
as Nikolai Rostov. It’s not so much
that the acting is bad, but rather
that the character is just played, or
possibly written, incorrectly. Instead
of being fraught by his divided
loyalties, Nikolai just comes across
as a fickle asshole with no real
regard for anyone else.
The previously mentioned
short length does create some
pacing issues, however. The series
practically ignores Helene towards
the end, although the few scenes in
which she features are poignantly
performed. Additionally, there are
a few moments here and there that
don’t quite have the impact they
should because we just haven’t spent
as much time with the characters
as would have been appropriate.
Perhaps the worst case of this is
Petya Rostov’s death where, to be
completely honest, I barely gave a
shit.
The first half of the series, at first
glance, seems to be more focused
on the romance and court intrigue
aspects of the plot. This isn’t
necessarily a criticism per se, as it is
a good way to pull in more casual
audiences, and eases the viewer
into the story without immediately
bombarding them with Tolstoy’s
heavy philosophising. Additionally,
the reasoning for this structure
becomes beautifully apparent in one
moment in episode 5, with Andrei
Bolkonsky’s and Anatole Kuragin’s
meeting on the battlefield. It serves
to make us experience the full force
of Andrei’s realisation by making
us undergo it at the same time. Just
as he realises how trivial the small
transgressions and struggles of egos
back home are in the face of the
great human tragedy of war, so too
does the audience.
I also have some final stray
observations on the series. Firstly, I
love the use of lighting in this series.
In particular, for Natasha and its
relation to her development. Also,
the memorial montage for Andrei,
and its format are downright absurd.
It feels like someone accidentally
cut in a wedding video from the
80s and actually caused me to laugh
when I first watched it.
Some of the self-proclaimed
guardians of high literature may take
issue with Davies’ initial approach
to the series. Thing is, at the end of
the day, War & Peace is a love story.
Okay, that’s a little disingenuous.
Rather, it’s about the great cruelty
of the world and the secret, fragile,
yet immensely powerful weapons
against it; love and compassion.
Everyone behind this adaptation
clearly seems to understand this,
certainly better than its detractors.
Ultimately, I think Tolstoy himself
would be quite pleased with this
distillation of his tonic against
doom & gloom, and all it tries to
accomplish.

T
his anime is one which
is a stark departure from
how typical anime, or
indeed superhero stories,
usually are and that is a completely
good thing. The biggest quality of
this show is that it feels fresh and
new. It was originally a webcomic
which was so popular it got its own
animated adaption, and it is not
hard to see why. The show features
Saitama, our protagonist, who is so
strong he can defeat all his enemies
with, as the title suggests, one
punch. What follows are episodes
filled with intense action,outlandish
hilarity, and just some plain, crazy
fun.
The standard trope we see or
experience is usually that of a chosen
or gifted hero, who must learn all
the skills necessary to defeat the
villain.This show flips that trope on
its head in an awesome parody kind
of way. Our hero is so strong that
all his battles end with one punch,
and because of this, he is literally
bored and just wants to find a
worthy opponent (along with some
fans). The reason he got that way?
He trained on his own so hard he
went bald (I’m not making this up).
Despite all his immense power, the
best you can describe his personality
as is stoic, humble and a little
unremarkable.
The mostly standalone episodes
feature our hero meeting, and
defeating, different villains and
monsters as well as meeting other
heroes along the way. Everyone
reacts in differing and amusing ways
when seeing Saitama’s attitude as
well as his strength. There is also a
simple ongoing plot thread about
Saitama trying to become a more
professional hero and wanting
to be treated with more respect
from everyone else. The succession
of battles all pile up, ultimately
culminating in the final showdown
towards the last few episodes.
The plot, although simple and
minimalist, has made this anime
one of the best to ever hit the world.
One Punch Man has shown that
you do not need an over-the-top
protagonist, someone hell bent on
taking over the world or a grand
adventure to be entertaining.
This show doesn’t try to be funny
yet it is a large bundle of laughs.
A lot of hilarity comes from
seeing the villains and monsters
(and sometimes heroes) scoff at
Saitama’s appearance and brag
about their own strength, only to
be promptly dealt with in one hit.
It also helps that Saitama almost
always has a bored expression and
is completely non-plussed about
anything happening around him
and everyone he confronts. For
example, in one awesome encounter,
a monster states he’s going to go on
a rampage for one week, all the way
to Saturday, and Saitama is shocked
because it means he missed the
Saturday supermarket sale, leading
him to punch out the monster’s guts
in frustration.
Obviously just seeing countless
monsters get defeated would get old
rather quickly, so to add something
different, other heroes show up as
the show progresses with some of
them having recurring or supporting
roles. A plot point is that all the
heroes are divided into different
ranks, set by the Hero Association,
and their power set and attitudes
usually reflects their status. It’s
refreshing to see new players enter
the playing field and see what they
bring to the table. They approach
problems and other characters in
unique ways and it’s entertaining to
see the interplay between them.
One of the problems of the show,
however, is that some of these
heroes aren’t developed enough and
come off as one dimensional. In
particular, the S-rank hero Tornado
suffers the most as she comes off as
a bratty girl with a lot of power and
an unlikable personality. The same
problem could be extended to the
villains and monsters, but as they
are usually taken out in the episode
they appear in, it’s not so much
an issue with them. Honestly, this
is a relatively small issue and I’m
basically nitpicking here.
The animation quality of the
show is top-notch. All the monsters
are animated with great detail and
each episode is a visual delight. The
fight scenes are also all wonderfully
rendered; you can see and feel every
impact and force behind all the
punches and attacks. There are also
subtle touches in the animation
which are much appreciated. For
example, seeing Saitama’s eyes
changing expression depending on
the intensity of the situation as well
as the monsters’ faces going from
deadly and full of rage to glassy eyed
and dead.
One Punch Man deserves
all the popularity and praise
it has considering what it has
accomplished. It might not be a
great battle series with an original
story but it is an excellent parody
and action series. This anime is
entertaining,unique and definitely a
fun watch and with only 12 episodes
out so far, there is little reason for
you not to watch. It is with eager
anticipation, that we all wait for
season two.
