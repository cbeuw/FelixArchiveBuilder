O
ver the past few
months, my team and
I have been organising
an event called Pwc
Presents: Volunteer Dinner; an
event to celebrate the hard-work
of Imperial’s volunteers, to help
promote volunteering societies and
to build new relationships between
societies.There’s been a huge wealth
of support for this new event and I
hope that this dinner will help other
volunteers as I hope it will help me.
As chair of a relatively new
society (ICSM Connect) it’s been,
at times, difficult to build up a new
community. Volunteer Dinner was
dreamt up as an answer to my own
problems. Like many volunteering
groups, the strength of our society
is built on the strength of our
teams and every term we’re faced
with new challenges, from finding
sponsorship to training. It’s easy to
see other similar volunteer societies
tackling the same problems yet
there are very few opportunities to
find out how they overcome their
challenges.
Unlike sports or arts, there are
no drunken Wednesday nights at
the Reynolds/Metric for alcohol-
induced bonding. And as much
I enjoy getting drunk and could
imagine myself chanting “Volunteer
for old people! Volunteer for old
people!” grabbing onto unfortunate
nearby strangers, there’s something
that just doesn’t seem right about
that image. It’s not what normally
springs to mind when thinking
about the galas and balls usually
associated with volunteering.
Volunteer Dinner is all about
finding out more about each other
and how we can help one another.
Volunteers are a similar breed and
the truth is, if you’re a student
willing to give up copious hours
of your time to help out others,
without the need for recognition or
glorification then you have a unique
characteristic or virtue.
One of the promotional ideas for
the Volunteer Dinner was to release
a ‘Humans of New York’ style
video series to Facebook entitled
‘Volunteers of Imperial’ where we’d
ask two or three questions to get
volunteers to chat with the camera.
Out of this we found almost every
volunteer had very similar answers:
I do it because I love helping people
and being there to listen to their
stories and their hardships. I do it
for my team, working together to
face worthwhile challenges. I just
enjoy volunteering, there’s nothing
more to it.
So,if you’re a volunteer,or if you’re
interested in finding out more about
various volunteering societies and
meeting the committee of these
societies, then this a dinner for

you. We’ve got a really nice venue
(Double Tree by Hilton hotel),
some great musical entertainment,
some prizes to give out and a really
awesome menu. Plus, support from
PwC’s sponsorship is letting us keep
it cheap. So please consider coming
and I hope to see you there!
Picocon 33: Origins - 20th
February
P
icocon is a small
convention run by Imperial
College Science Fiction
and Fantasy Society
(ICSF). It is one of the only entirely
student-run conventions, and it has
been held in late February each year
for 33 years – this February 20th
marking Picocon 33.
Picocon has a long history of
having Guests of Honour, who are
famous or up and coming authors
in the Sci-Fi or Fantasy genres,
including Cory Doctorow, Jaine
Fenn, Alastair Reynolds, Frances
Hardinge and many more. These
Guests of Honour (GoH) give talks
about their books and the theme of
the year.
This year’s GoH are Michelle
Paver, Author of The Chronicles of
Ancient Darkness, Paul Cornell,
previous screen-writer for Doctor
Who, and author of several comics
and the novels Shadow Police series,
and Carrie Hope Fletcher who
played Beth in the War of the Worlds
musical. Her debut fantasy novel,
On the Other Side, is coming out this
summer. She is currently playing
Eponine in the West End in Les
Miserables.
There is an author’s panel where
the authors can be asked questions
by the attendees, and Turkey
Readings in collaboration with
RAG, where examples of books
so badly written are read out so
that people will pay to prevent the
reading from continuing (or to
make it keep going!).
Silly Games is an event where we
imitate various gameshows, and we
also have Destruction of Dodgy
Merchandise, where examples of
terribly misguided merchandise are
bid on to be saved or dunked in
liquid nitrogen and smashed by the
highest bidder. The proceeds from
all go to charity.This year,as last year,
Stuart Ashens is coming to Imperial
from the Youtube domain to chair
the auctioning of the merchandise.
Alongside the games and panels
there will be a variety of stalls selling
everything from our own Picocon
merchandise to jewellery and even
professionally illustrated prints by
Autun Purser.
The Pub Quiz will be in Metric,
with teams captained by our GoH!
Finally,we also have an event known
simply as Harmless Fun.
The theme of this year’s
Picocon event is ‘Origins’. Upon
investigation, there were two origin
stories for the convention – one
being that it was a gathering of
ICSF members to play board-
games at another’s house which they
decided to simply escalate; the other
being that the first ever Picocon was
actually an organised ICSF trip to
a different convention in Glasgow,
whereupon the group decided that
they should make a convention like
that themselves! Picocon’s name
was reportedly coined by Steven
Barnett, when it was observed that
it was a very small convention –
earning it the prefix ‘pico’!
Picocon has come far over the
years, from a trip to a different
convention entirely (or board games
in a flat!) to a well known London
Sci-Fi convention. This year, it will
be held on Saturday 20th
of February.
Registration beings at 9am on the
day in Beit Quad. Tickets can be
bought from the union website
or on the day at registration, with
concession prices for students
and further reductions for ICSF
members.

L
ast weekend, Imperial
played host to the
largest ever student-led
Neuroscience conference,
organised under the banner of the
London Students’ Neuroscience
Network (LSNeuroN). For the
first time, neuroscience societies of
the five London medical schools
– Imperial, UCL, King’s College
London, Bart’s and St George’s
– collaborated to put together
the weekend affair, consisting of
keynote speeches and a wide variety
of symposia organised by each
neuroscience society, as well as a
poster prize session.
Keynote speakers included Nobel
Laureate in Physiology or Medicine
2014 Professor John O’Keefe,
who spoke to an overflowing SAF
lecture theatre about his discovery
of “place cells” that form a kind
of “inner GPS” of the brain, for
which he was awarded the Nobel
Prize. Professor John Donoghue,
who hails all the way from Brown
University in the states, was here to
talk about his work which allows
paralysed people to control artificial
limbs with their thoughts. Professor
Maria Spillantini travelled from
Cambridge to talk about her work
on neurodegenerative disease, while
Sir Colin Blakemore spoke about
the workings of perception.
In addition to the impressive line-
up of big names in neuroscience,the
selection of symposia showcased
the latest research in all aspects
of neuroscience, from a panel
discussing artificial intelligence to
a neuroscience ethics workshop to
an exploration of the interactions
between neuroscience and art.
Imperial’s Neuroscience Society
organised the wildly popular brain
dissection workshop by Professor
Steve Gentleman, where delegates
got to see first-hand the dissection
(but who is now a developing
normally as a toddler) was filmed
at the conference, as delegates were
inspired by the family’s story and a
short presentation on the science
behind it. The conference was also
a fantastic networking opportunity
for students in the field,as they were
introduced to the most exciting
research and the people involved.
Delegates had a chance to mingle
with top researchers in the field
during the wine reception (which
featured a live band!) as well as learn
from each other during the poster
presentation session.
Over the two days, the conference
attracted almost 400 delegates
from all over the country and even
a significant number from abroad.
They were a mix of undergraduate
medical students, masters and PhD
students, as well as post-doctoral
researchers and professionals
working in related fields such as
music therapy.
This would not have been
possible without the contributions
and hard work from all the
universities, fulfilling LSNeuroN’s
aim to foster collaboration among
the neuroscience community in
London. This is its biggest event
to date, and a promising testament
to the variety and quality that can
result from such a collaboration.

followed by a heated debate about
the risks and benefits of recreational
drugs.
