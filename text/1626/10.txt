here are very few games
that have provided the
same joy and awe as
Super Mario Galaxy. I
remember fondly the moment when
I, as Mario, was able to run around
a small spherical planet for the first
time. I wasn’t defying gravity; I was
adhering to it, in a way no game had
ever done before. It didn’t allow the
player to control gravity, instead it
ability that the player must use
to navigate the environment and
defeat enemies. It’s an idea that, if
implemented badly,could have been
awful. Luckily, the developers have
perfected the controls: hold down
a trigger to float and then use the
joystick or gyroscope to aim where
you want to ‘fall.’
The expansive open world, unlike
in Super Mario Galaxy, is flat (in
the sense that no part of the world
is curved). There are times when
levels are formed in the same way as
Galaxy – spherical and cylindrical –
but,these are not what make Gravity
Rush so great. The incremental
cityscape, from your beginnings in
an undesirable part of town to the
city centre which adorns the cover,
gives the player an increasing sense
of wonderment. The initial thrill of
floating around, and walking on the
side of, small buildings is eclipsed
again and again. By the time you’re
finally towering above the city,
there’s a real rush (pardon the pun).
The game isn’t just a platformer;
it incorporates many role-playing
elements. You can upgrade your
powers, do optional side quests, and
unlock extra costumes. These don’t
detract from the core gameplay
in anyway, but they often feel like
unnecessary extras. Personally, I
would have preferred a pure action-
platformer. Super Mario Galaxy, like
many other Nintendo games, gets it
right in the way that your character’s
abilities don’t get better over time,
but expand through new power-ups
and level mechanics.
Gravity Rush is very obviously a
game by Japanese developers for a
Japanese audience. It’s story begins
with the tired trope of amnesia. You
play as a girl called Kat, who meets
a cat, Dusty, with gravitational
powers. You’re thrown into a
world where gravitational storms
and creatures known as Nevi are
ravaging the local populace. And it’s
your job to save the day. At first, the
plot does feel uninspired,but it soon
grows into one of fantastical intrigue
which even manages to incorporate
themes of class and corruption.
changing environment, and districts
of town, the sky changes colour
as you move between each: the
orange of Auldnoir, the purple of
Pleajeune, the yellow of Endestria,
and the iconic green of Vendecentre.
Each reflects certain characteristics
of these areas, making them feel
distinct.
Gravity Rush is the first game since
Super Mario Galaxy that has evoked
the same childish excitement inside
me. I have a huge amount of respect
for developers Project Siren (and
Bluepoint Games who handled
the remaster). It might not be as
polished or as revolutionary, but it’s
just as fun. There’s something about
playing with gravity that is just
awesome.
Gravity Rush Remastered is out
now on PS4
offered up new environments where
the concept of up and down was
constantly in flux.
Five years later, Project Siren
released Gravity Rush for the
Playstation Vita. Critics at the
time noted its innovative controls
and mechanics, but it never quite
achieved the success it deserved
(mostly as a result of being on a
platform that no one bought). At
the core of Gravity Rush is the
ability to manipulate gravity, an
Comic style cutscenes playfully add
character, and motive, to the world’s
inhabitants. If you enjoy the themes
and styles often found in anime,this
might be the game for you.
For a game that has been ported
from the Vita to the PS4, Gravity
Rush Remastered looks and performs
marvellously. It’s a great remaster.
With the extra power of the PS4,
the gritty, almost steam-punk,
environments are given the respect
they deserve. To exaggerate the
