T
here have been very few
games released in recent
years that have had more
to live up to than The
Witness. Unlike the recent Fallout
4, there was no multi-million dollar
marketing campaign, no tube ads,
no merchandising – in other words,
no ‘hype’. Instead, The Witness has
been quietly on our radar for close
to six years.
Braid designer Jonathan Blow’s
sophomore effort was originally
announced – and demoed – in
2010, having already been in
development for a year. Blow has
spent the last half-decade polishing,
tweaking, and vastly overshooting
the planned 2013 release date –
as well as the original $800,000
budget. The finished game released
just a couple of a weeks ago, with a
final development cost of close to
$6 million. I picked it up on PS4 a
couple of days after release, to see if
it’s been worth the wait. It has.
The Witness is,at its heart,a game
about mazes. Dotted around its
idyllic island setting are some 650
puzzles, in the form of mazes on
panels. The player draws a line from
the start to end of the maze, and
solving a panel lights up the next
one. Solving some puzzles will open
doors, move platforms, or affect the
game’s world in other ways. Taken
at face value, this sounds pretty
dull – how, then, have I sunk over
20 hours into these mazes without
getting bored?
The reason is that Blow, as in
Braid, has followed the Nintendo
school of game design: introduce a
new, simple concept to the player,
and then explore all possible
permutations of that concept. In
The Witness, different mazes will
have different rules, signified by
markings on the maze itself. These
rules are taught to the player without
any words or explicit explanation –
instead, a simple maze with a new
rule has to be solved, followed by
a more complex one, and so on.
The island is split up into different
areas – there’s a swamp, a desert, a
beach, and more – and in each area
the puzzles have different rules.
It’s when these rules start to be
combined with each other that the
game gets really tricky.
The Witness is not an easy game.
Quite often I’ve come up against a
puzzles whose rules I simply don’t
know,or ones whose rules I do know,
but haven’t fully understood. This is
intentional – in some cases, the only
solution is to walk away and come
back later. There’s a certain delight
in realising that a rule you’ve just
learned means you can now solve
a puzzle on the other side of the
island. Similarly, the feeling that
comes with solving a puzzle you’ve
been stuck on for ages is comparable
to beating a boss in Dark Souls. It’s
you against Jonathan Blow, and
occasionally you come out on top,
and feel like a king – then the next
panel lights up.
Many players will be tempted to
look up the solutions online, but I’d
advise against this. It not only ruins
the fun,but in The Witness it makes
learning the rules more difficult,and
you’ll need to look up solutions for
the next panel too; cheating will
snowball, and is best avoided.
The Witness is easily the best-
looking game I’ve played on the
PS4, pinching that crown from
the excellent Grow Home. The
island looks gorgeous; the colours
are vibrant, the water gloriously
reflective, and the chunky-polygons
art style is one of the best I’ve
seen. There’s no music – the game
is almost silent, the only sounds
being the lapping of waves, the
player’s footsteps, or the low hum of
the maze panels. Anyone who has
played the Myst series will feel right
at home. The rare few melodies feel
significant, and actually slightly
creepy – play with headphones if
you can.
The island is also absolutely
packed with secrets and things for
the player to discover – the level of
attention to detail is astounding. I
don’t want to give too much away,
but as an example, there are some
pieces of what can only be described
as artwork which are only visible
from a certain perspective, and one
kind of puzzle I wasn’t even aware
of, which, when discovered, totally
blew me away. What plot that exists
is largely left up to the player’s own
interpretation, with various audio
recordings and sculptures scattered
around the island.
In this way, the game is like an art
gallery of sorts – what you get from
it, other than the puzzles, depends
on what you bring with you.
The Witness is not a game I’d
necessarily recommend to everyone
– it can be punishingly difficult, and
the lack of a concrete story may turn
some away – but, for me and likely
for many others, it’s a masterpiece,
and I use that word without a hint
of hyperbole.I can’t wait to see what
Jonathan Blow does next.
