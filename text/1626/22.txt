L
ast weekend saw the
return of the prestigious
Roehampton Club
University Cup, with 16
mixed teams across the country
playing in a tournament renowned
for its high standard of squash.
Since winning the inaugural
tournament Imperial had sat on
the sidelines as team after team had
lifted the glorious Roehampton
Cup. The first team from Imperial,
made up of Ian Jubb, Jez Carter,
James McCouat, Tom Readshaw
(captain), and Ann Babtie, had their
confidence smashed in the very first
match of the tournament when
they were drawn against the mighty
Leicester in the group stages.
Leicester, now taking after their
local football team, were a force to
be reckoned with as they took the
win from Imperial 3-2.
Meanwhile, the second Imperial
team, made up of Kharthik
Chakravarthy, Sam Horne, Nick
Dunn (captain), Ujjval Jaipuria,
and Uttara Raju, had their work
cut out for them in a tough group
containing LSE, Kings and Bristol.
They gave the other teams a good
run for their money but ultimately
came up short.The first team picked
themselves up, remembered their
training, and went on to batter
eternal rivals UCL and Bristol 2nd’s

Incredible performance from squash to nick title from favourites
to secure their place in the quarter-
finals against Leicester 2nds.
After destroying Leicester’s 2nd
team in an attempt to intimidate
their 1st
s (who were now blazing
towards the final from the other half
of the draw) Imperial 1st
s were set
to take on Bristol in the semi-final.
Meanwhile, Imperial 2nd
s managed
to beat Kings 2nd
s 3-2 before finally
succumbing to UCL 3-2 to finish in
a commendable 14th
place. Tensions
were high at semi-final time as
Imperial and Bristol were drawn at
2-2.
The hopes of playing in the final
fell on Ian Jubb to win the deciding
match. With almost unnatural
composure he secured the win and
Imperial’s place in the final against
the big dogs, Leicester. Fuelled by
revenge (and the club’s excellent
Sunday roast dinner), Imperial were
ready for the final. With fantastic
performances from all of the team,
and victories in some extremely
tight matches, Imperial overcame
unlikely odds to reclaim their place
as champions of the Roehampton
squash tournament.
The prize giving followed, with a
memorable and witty speech from
team captain turned comedian
Tom Readshaw being a particular
highlight. As reward for an
outstanding performance each
player received a Bohemian crystal
trophy, VIP tickets to Canary
Wharf squash classic and a year’s
squash membership at Roehampton
Club, valued at around £500.

I
n our last home game of the
regular season, the Immortals
faced the Kingston Cougars.
After an amazing performance
against the Lions last Sunday, the
team was confident coming into
the game. However, after a long and
hard-fought game, the final score
was 12-20 to the Cougars.
Early on in the game, the
defensive team were moving
around, causing a lot of havoc
on Kingston’s offense. Multiple
penalties were called, particularly
false starts from the Cougar’s
offensive side. As a result, the line
of scrimmage was continuously
moved up field, closer and closer to
the end zone. Finally, the defense
were able to force a punt, opening
up the flood-gates for the offensive
team. With an extremely impressive
drive, Quarterback, Kevin Kimono,
rushed into the end zone getting the
first touchdown of the day (2-point
conversion was unsuccessful). With
a tiring and injury-filled defense,
multiple offensive linemen filled in
on defense and held the Cougars
into the half with a score of 6-7.
In the second half, a frustrated
Cougars side adapted to our vocal
defense by introducing clap snaps
in the hopes of reducing penalties
going against them. This failed to
stop Sam ‘No Chill’ Hill laying a
filthy sack on the quarterback and
Alex ‘heads down’Brockhurst laying
him out in another play. Well done
Alex!
On the other hand, running back
Papa Noach Ben-Haim made
some very impressive runs gaining
a lot of yards, however, a fumble
resulted in a turnover and ultimately
a touchdown by the Cougar’s
quarterback(kickwasgood),making
the score 6-14. The offense came
back strong however, with multiple
impressive run plays and the famous
rolling maul, ending the third
quarter deep inside Cougar territory.
After a few plays, Josemi Idigoras
completed his first reception and
touchdown for the Immortals (two
point conversion was unsuccessful),
hopefully with many more to come
for him! After a late touchdown
from the Cougars, the game ended
with a score of 12-20, unfortunately
meaning that the Immortals are
now officially relegated from the
Premiership league, however, this
also gives the team a chance to
rebuild and come back strong. This
game’s MVPs were: Sam Hill –
for performing tremendously both
ways, laying down tackles left,
right, and centre; Markus Mohr –
again for performing very well both
ways; Harry Lawrence – covering
well, making essential plays to stop
passes; Race Koidan – for being a
good laugh, a good lad, and an even
more impressive versatile player;
and David Rovick – for playing in
a position he’s never been in before
and performing well.
