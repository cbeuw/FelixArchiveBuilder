FILM
Documentary corner: The Imposter
Ben Collier

O
n the 13th
of June,
1994, thirteen-year-
old Nicolas Barcley
went to play a game
of basketball with his friends in
San Antonio, Texas. This was the
last time he was seen. Missing for
three years and presumed dead, he
was suddenly discovered in Linares,
Spain. Or was he? Well, his family
said it was him. In fact, they were
entirely sure. This confirmation was
apparently enough for US embassy
officials and the FBI,who celebrated
the return of Nicolas with the
family. The issue is that the Nicolas
that went missing 3 years prior had
blue eyes and a thick Texan accent.
The person who turned up had
brown eyes and a French accent...
It seems unbelievable but it’s all
completely true. With a real world
set-up this good how could the film
not succeed?
There are a lot of unanswered
questions in this film but one thing
is certain: there was an imposter.
This pretender was 22 year-old
French-Algerian Frederic Bourdin:
an obsessive-yet-talented con man,
who turned out to have a long
history of impersonating various
children. The misidentification by
the family was predicted by Bourdin,
who is interviewed in the film; all
he had to do was capitalise on a
grieving and desperate mother and
sister, who we realise were probably
willing to believe anything. In the
end Bourdin was exposed by largely
one man – private investigator
Charles Parker.
The whole film gorgeously
unfolds in the style of a classic
thriller. Re-enactments are used
extensively to set the tone and
allow the documentary to take a
more narrative form. Normally,
when someone says the phrase ‘re-
enactments’ to me, images of cheap
and cheesily shot scenes come to
mind, but this is definitely not the
case here – the realism and style is
superb.
Director Bart Layton really
succeeds in maintaining tension
and mystery throughout.We are not
given all the information we need
right away,and my opinions changed
several times throughout the film.
Several questions are raised and
never answered: Did the Gibson’s
really think Bourdin was their son?
Did they convince themselves out
of desperation? Perhaps they had an
ulterior motive? If so, what motive
would explain allowing a stranger
into your house? I won’t spoil the
‘oh my God!’ moment of this film
– a moment which honestly makes
you question everything you’ve
begun to think up until that point –
I’ll just say that it gives you a good
central point when you debate the
question of “how the hell did he get
away with it?!”
Overall, The Imposter is a
masterfully assembled documentary.
Takeing the form of a documentary/
mockumentary fusion with the
best aspects of both genres being
extracted, The Imposter is uniquely
accomplished for a documentary
film, in terms of both tension and
edge-of-your-seat filmmaking.
