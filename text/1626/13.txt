The Student Academic Choice Awards are Imperial College Union’s
flagship event for empowering students to recognise, reward and
celebrate excellence among College staff. There are just two weeks
left to make your nomination for this year as they close on Friday
26 February.
The SACAs empower Imperial students to recognise, reward and
celebrate excellence among College staff. Since 2013, over 2000
nominations and 250,000 words of testimonials for almost 1000
members of staff have been sent in by students like you. All-
student panels then select 48 shortlistees, and the eight winners
are revealed each year in the SACAs ceremony.
You can nominate as many people in as many categories as you
like. Send in your nominations now and help recognise great
teaching and support at Imperial.
