Beyoncé wins the Super Bowl, again
Indira Mallik

B
eyoncé has never been
one to shy away from
making a statement; the
surprise release of her
self-titled album in 2013 proved
that. The release of ‘Formation’ 24
hours before upstaging Coldplay
at their headline gig at the Super
Bowl could be a new high. Not only
the manner of its release, but the
message it sends, at once politically
charged and gloriously celebratory,
makes ‘Formation’ one of Beyoncé’s
most powerful songs yet.
Released together with the
video, the song is so reliant on the
imagery to put forward its message,
it seems impossible to discuss
the song without referencing the
video as well. Directed by Melina
Matsoukas, who also directed
‘Pretty Hurts’ and Rihanna’s ‘We
Found Love’, the video feels more
art-house than those that usually
accompany Beyoncé’s songs. An
ad lib from the murdered Youtube
star and bounce artist Messy Mya
introduces a montage of post-
Hurricane Katrina New Orleans;
clapboard houses into floodwaters
act as a visual shorthand for the
chronic underinvestment by the
government of black communities.
Footage from Abteen Bagheri’s
2014 documentary That B.E.A.T.
cuts to reveal Beyoncé, squatting on
top of a sinking New Orleans police
cruiser with raw buccaneer swagger.
Her voice when she starts to sing
is hoarse, gravelly; closer to Nina
Simone or Ella Fitzgerald than
In its rap-adjacent, repetitive
lyrical pattern ‘Formation’ has
some stylistic themes common
with ‘7/11’. However, whilst ‘7/11’
is a carefree dance anthem about
youth and hedonism that as a result
of its hotel setting is somewhat
generic, ‘Formation’ is grounded
in a particular experience, deeply
entwined with the imagery of the
black South.
The video weaves through the past
and present, from the antebellum
South to Southern gothic, from the
churches that serve as the nucleus
of the Southern communities, to
take-away crayfish, Red Lobster,
and hot sauce. This is a celebration
and affirmation of identity from
Beyoncé who has sometimes been
accused of acting ‘too white’. “My
daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana
/ mix that negro and the creole make
a Texas bama” Beyoncé declares,
rooting herself in her Southern
ancestry, reclaiming racial slurs,
Perhaps she is reminding herself
too: “earned all this money / but
they’ll take the country from me”.
It must be difficult to reconcile her
present ‘Givenchy dress’level wealth
with her less affluent childhood, so
it is particularly sweet when she
declares “swag”to be a bottle of “hot
sauce in [her] bag”.
This is about more than
reclaiming a personal identity, it is
also a reclamation of the narrative
surrounding black Southern
communities, and black women.
It is joyous and celebratory in the
face of discrimination, violence, and
oppression. It tells us: don’t believe
what you see on the TV, this isn’t
gangland, these communities are
more than acts of police brutality
and grief. By inhabiting black
women from the past, Beyoncé
is holding up a picture of black
ancestry that opposes the imagery
that the mainstream media
propagates, indicting a media that
rewards showing black suffering
(Twelve Years a Slave) but refuses
to acknowledge the stories black
communities write for themselves
(Straight Outta Compton).
This is not about what other
people think or want, this is a
celebration of the beauty of black
women by a black woman, about
pride and self-love. Beyoncé sings
about all the features that society
tells black women they should
find unattractive in themselves. “I
love my negro nose with Jackson
Five nostrils” she says, “I like my
baby hair, baby hair and afro” she
tells us, as we see her four year old
daughter Blue Ivy playing, her afro
bouncing. Later Beyoncé, her own
hair in a big, blown-out afro joins a
lineup of black women with afros to
dance. There’s no mention of butts
or curves or plump lips, the features
that the white media fetishise in
black women whilst condemning
their noses and their kinky hair.
The power of black women
coming together was underscored
during Beyoncé’s half time
performance at the Super Bowl.
Wearing gold bandoliers, looking
like a glam guerrilla leader crossed
with Michael Jackson circa 1993,
flanked by dozens of black female
dancers, wearing black berets
in homage to the radical Black
Panthers Party, Beyoncé and the
dancers joined together to give the
‘black power’ salute made famous
by Olympic athletes Tommie Smith
and John Carlos in 1968.
Throughout, ‘Formation’ is far
more radical and outspoken than
we might’ve expected, there is no
question of looking at the subtext or
reading between the lines.In a video
filled with iconic images, one of the
most striking is towards the end. A

young black boy in a hoodie dances
in front of a line up of (white)
policemen in riot gear. He ends his
moves by orchestrating the police to
put up their hands in the ‘hands up
don’t shoot’ gesture made famous in
the Black Lives Matter protests.The
scene cuts away to graffiti on a wall
that reads “stop shooting us”.
Beyoncé, and husband Jay Z have
been low profile but passionate
supporters of the Black Lives Matter
movement,with Jay Z donating $1.5
million in profits from his streaming
website Tidal to Black Lives Matter
and other similar organisations
on the day that Trayvon Martin,
another victim of police brutality
would’ve turned 21. ‘Formation’ is
Beyoncé’s acknowledgement that
it is no longer enough to condemn
quietly, nor support quietly; this
is her finally, not exactly finding
her voice on the issue, but raising
it, and it is anything but quiet. In
‘Formation’, Beyoncé embodies
the much maligned role of the
angry black woman, and does so
unapologetically, claims her black
femaleness with pride, and says yes,
I am angry, with good reason.
The “I slay” in ‘Formation’ could
easily be substituted with Maya
Angelou’s “I rise”; the track at
times feels like ‘Still I Rise’ or Nina
Simone’s ‘Young, Gifted and Black’
“Hands up, don’t shoot.” Photo Credit: Beyoncé Foundation Video
starting from ‘Independent Women’
with Destiny’s Child, all the way
to ‘Flawless’ which used sections
from Nigerian feminist writer
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s
TED talk as a refrain. She has
been less outspoken on racial
matters however, sometimes in
sharp contrast to other black female
artists, perhaps most notably her
younger sister Solange. ‘Formation’
in its call to arms to black women,
however, acts as a brilliant example
of what intersectional feminism
should be. Trans women, and
queer issues aren’t ignored either,
the video uses footage from That
B.E.A.T, a documentary on bounce
music and queer culture in New
Orleans, and features Big Freedia,
a queer bounce artist.This inclusion
and celebration of Southern culture
cements Beyoncé’s reputation as an
artist with something important to
say, aside from being a phenomenal
entertainer.
“I slay” sings Beyoncé repeatedly
in ‘Formation’, and no one in good
conscience can argue otherwise.

rap (no surprise that the track was
co-written by Swae Lee of rap duo
Rae Sremmurd) set to bounce

provides punctuation to Beyoncé’s
unapologetic, punchy lyrics.

she is a black, Southern artist.

For many
years now,
she has had
nothing left
to prove
set to bounce music. Some will still
be disappointed that Beyoncé waited
so long.For many years now,she has
had nothing left to prove,and having
won every commercial and critical
accolade possible (twice),nothing to
lose. She has leant her voice to the
feminist movement in particular,

#HotTakes
of the week
W
hat is a hot take?
Elspeth Reeve, for
The New Republic
last year, described
it as a “piece of deliberately
provocative commentary that is
based almost entirely on shallow
moralizing” which is “usually
written on tight deadlines with
little research or reporting, and even
less thought.” Using that definition,
I guess we could define everything
we write in FELIX as a ‘hot take.’
In an age where most opinions are
expressed in less than 140 characters,
hot takes are now the norm.
Kanye randomly spurted out this
turd on Twitter on Tuesday. Kim,
please take his phone away. I’m a
fan of Kanye’s work but he really
needs someone to help him filter his
thoughts (especially after his praise
of Ben Carson last year). I have now
thrown away my favourite Kanye
t-shirt. I don’t want to be seen as
promoting someone problematic in
any way.
So Help Me God
Not even once?
In a tweet that would probably
enrage most Imperial students,
Allen’s response to the Education
Minister asked the same question
school children have been asking for
years. She’s right that a lot of people
are unlikely to ever use the maths
or science they learnt at school in
real life, but the same could be said
for P.E. I haven’t got off my fat arse
and done any real physical exercise
for years.
