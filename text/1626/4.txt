Could Imperial ever have a rent strike?
UCL have had a successful history of striking over housing but could the students of
Imperial ever rise up and do the same?

Editor-in-Chief
W
e’ve had our fair
share of housing
disputes at
Imperial.
If you think people don’t care,
check out the ICTV’s ‘Imperial
Questions Live’ debate on the
subject of Weeks hall from last year.
Think union council but with ironed
shirts and better behaviour since it’s
on YouTube for eternity and there
were grown-ups present.
150 students at UCL have been
striking since late January, refusing
to pay their second term’s rent,
which was due at the start of the
year. Altogether, this amounts to
£250,000’s worth of rent. They are
demanding a 40% cut in prices and
a rent cap for future students. The
students are split between two halls,
but most are in one in Camden.
Although the halls are well-known
for having cockroaches and mice,
they aren’t nearly as bad as the
halls involved in UCL’s previous
successful rent strike. In these halls,
loud building work was audible all
day every day in bedrooms during
Imperial accommodation – a history of dissidence

the exam period, despite promises
that renovations would be over in
months.
Perhaps the most interesting
thing to come of UCL’s previous
rent strike is that it actually worked.
Last year, students withheld rent
and held protests at several halls
and were eventually reimbursed for
one term’s rent. UCL had initially
warned the students that they could
face academic sanctions if they
didn’t pay, but these threats were
swiftly removed after legal warnings
from the government. Consumer
rights bodies also reminded UCL
and its students that you cannot
be academically penalised for
outstanding non-tuition fee debts.
Even without the threat of no
graduation, is such a display of
financial dissidence realistic here at
Imperial? Students often complain
about the high rents in first year,
but after that, we tend to disappear
into the private housing system. If
first year students were effectively
mobilised as they were at UCL, it
would be possible.
Organisers of UCL’s Cut the Rent
campaign told FELIX that the
rent strike had been organised by
simply knocking door to door in the
halls concerned. At the suggestion
that some campuses are more up
for direct action than others, the
representative told us something
along the lines of: if you can do it
here, you can do it anywhere.
Cut the Rent told us that a critical
mass of students involved was
needed, not only for the plan to
work, but for other students to join
in and the campaign to snowball.
Their successful rent strike had
between a third and half of the
residents striking.
It’s easy to complain that students
at Imperial aren’t interested in the
political, or social justice issues,
but over the years when it comes
accommodation, students have
proved that they do care.
In 2014, the college conducted
a Residential Experience Review,
with one of the outcomes being a
dedication to transparency, but little
evidence of this has been seen.
Last year, Weeks halls was shut
down. The hall wardening team at
the time had no idea that this was
even on the cards, and only found
out that union council had voted
to support the college’s closure
decision after having seen FELIX’s
Twitter feed the next day. After an
emergency council meeting, and
two re-votes, council once again
chose to support the closure of the
halls. Although Woodward rents
were reduced from college’s original
plans, the union’s ‘Against Acton’
campaign arguably came far too late
to succeed.
Garden hall is still empty, and
has been for three years now.
Protests and change.org petitions
were bandied about back in 2013
but to no avail. Imperial’s most
oversubscribed hall was shut down
at the end of that academic year. As
urgent as the space was needed by
college,reportedly for offices,it took
a further two years for the furniture
inside the halls to be removed.
Fees rebates at Imperial are
not unheard of. Several first-year
students at halls across Eastside and
Xenia have complained that the size
of their rooms are not consistent
with others in their rent band and
have received sizable amounts of
cash back. There is obviously a
jump from this to not paying any
rent at all, but it’s not an unfamiliar
concept to private landlords like
those running Xenia or university-
run halls.
Essentially, it’s a case of university
profit over student experience,
but with the government’s higher
education green paper likely to go
through, student satisfaction will
soon affect how much universities
can charge in tuition fees. For
this reason, top universities like
ours will be more eager than ever
to improve National Student
Satisfaction survey scores, and as
accommodation is such an implicit
part of your experience, it should
be high up on Imperial’s list of
priorities.
