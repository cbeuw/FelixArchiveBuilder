t’s amazing how science can be
so fiercely intertwined with a
topic as contentious as dieting.
The relationship between the
two became evident when I attended
the past weekend’s most anticipated
brainy event – the London
Students’ Neuroscience Conference
2016. It heralded a most intriguing
symposium on mechanisms of
psychiatric disorders, with a special
focus on Anorexia Nervosa.
Anorexia is predisposed by
certain character traits such as
perfectionism and obsessive habit
rigidity. Thinness is heralded as the
essence of substance – the sad but
true irony ingrained in the mindsets
of those affected. It is indeed true
that these traits may be labelled
as inherent, but not many of us
are aware of the danger of their
development following what would
initially seem to be a perfectly
innocent,healthy approach to losing
weight.
We’ve all experienced the
common scenario of having a friend
(or yourself) wanting to be healthy.
You start exercising more and eating
healthier,understandingthenuances
of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
It’s all well and good, until the very
thing you use for self-betterment
– Google’s myriad of resources
detailing every nutritional aspect of
each food that touches your lips –
turns around to stab you in the gut.
The sheer volume of information
we have at our fingertips is also our
biggest enemy when it comes to
treatment of psychiatric disorders.
The neurobiological changes
initiating anorexic behaviour in
patients are enhanced by apps, such
as myfitnesspal; apps which many
dieters rim with halos. So what is
the problem with logging every
calorie ingested and every gram of
fat tallied? Focus is transferred from
maintaining health to counting
calories. Everything essentially
becomes a vicious numbers game.
One ends up choosing a small piece
of candy over an avocado just to
fit into an appropriate intake. That
piece of toast with butter and jam
goes from being breakfast to half
a day’s intake, to toast without any
butter and jam, to simply an item
with an invisible, paltry calorie
count plastered on its surface.
Only numbers rule. The anorexic is
trapped in a formidable, monstrous
world of counting. Nutritional
balance is impaired; restriction takes
its place as the norm.
This rigidity knocks kinks into
All about the numbers – waist measurements and calorie counts.

The neurobiology of Anorexia
A glimpse into the calorie counting culture promoted by fitness apps
stimuli. Hence, we are better off
without the constant stressing over
numbers. After all, the human brain
has evolved to preserve space for so
many other more important things.
the typical human reward circuitry
systems.These are mainly located in
the ventral striatum – a major part
of the basal ganglia, controlling the
reward system – and orbitofrontal
cortex –0 a prefrontal cortex region
involved in decision-making. The
more one loses weight, the thinner
one gets, and it is this thinness
that activates higher ventral striatal
activity in acute anorexic control
patients. This invokes an increased
ventral striatum response. Over
time, neural connections are
further disrupted, compulsivity and
obsession over intake and outtake
are expatiated. Whilst people of
normal weight gratefully succumb
to the occasional chocolate-studded
muffin, in anorexic patients, food
reward is perverted towards low
energy dense foods, with fMRI
scans showing increased frontal pole
activity when shown high-calorie
food pictures, displaying greater
aversion to them. This impaired
balance interrupts interoceptive
pathways, and guess what serves
only to trigger this inappropriate
lusting after ‘safe’ foods all the time,
instead of giving in to the occasional
cupcake? Yes,that dieting app which
helped you drop the pounds in the
first place, convincing you that the
lower the number, the better.
It is important to note here that
recent studies have confirmed that
even calorie counts are simply
mere guesses at best; hindered by
individual differences in gut flora,
food intolerances and environmental
Iron supplement safety questioned

n investigation of the
genetic mechanisms
activated in reaction
to the elevated iron
concentration, and a subsequent
examination of the cells in higher
detail, revealed that just within ten
minutes, cells treated with the iron
solution had activated DNA repair
systems, which were still activated
six hours later.
Of course, the idea that excessive
iron can cause serious damage to
the human body isn’t a new one.
Iron overload and iron related
toxicity can cause mitochondrial
damage, cytotoxicity and apoptosis
and promote problematic growth of
fibrous and cancerous tissues.
However an insufficient amount
of iron in the body can also be
unhealthy. Iron deficiency can cause
anaemia, in turn causing a range
of symptoms, such as tiredness,
lethargy, a shortness of breath, and
headaches.
Iron deficiency is in fact so
widespread that six million
prescriptions are issued each year
for iron tablets in England and
Wales alone, and it is estimated
that it affects over 3.5 billion people
worldwide.
With the consumption of such
great quantities of iron supplements,
it is crucial to further investigate
potential health risks.
As put by Dr Shovlin, ‘’This study
helps to open the conversation
about how much iron people take.
At the moment, each standard
iron tablet contains almost 10
times the amount of iron men are
recommended to eat each day – and
these dosages haven't changed for
more than 50 years. This research
suggests we may need to think more
carefully about how much iron we
give to people, and try and tailor the
dose to the patient."
So maybe have a chat with your
GP before throwing out your iron
tablets.
