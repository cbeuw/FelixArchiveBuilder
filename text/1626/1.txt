Junior doctor contracts to
be imposed by government
Hours after the announcement
a protest was held outside the
Department of Health
Rowers forced to pay hotel
two grand in fines
The boat club had their annual party there last
month
T
he rowing club have
been forced to pay £2050
in reparations to the
Ambassadors Hotel in
Bloomsbury, where they held their
annual dinner three weeks ago.
The payment came straight from
the club’s own account of Self
Generated Income, which will
include money the club have raised
from sponsorship and membership
costs. In other words, this is about
a third of their income from this
year’s member subscriptions.
The club's social activities remain
banned until further notice,
however, they are still allowed to
train and last week did so with a
British Rowing coach.They are also
set to compete this weekend.
Union officials met with boat club
trainers and the hotel this week
as part of their now completed
investigation. The findings are
not yet public, as they will have to
approved by the Union's governance
committee before any further action
is taken.
The £2050 fine was paid in full
by the boat club last week, and
will presumably go towards what
the hotel claimed were substantial
cleaning costs and a smashed toilet
door.
Allegations about the boat club's
behaviour surfaced two weeks
ago, after the hotel made a series
allegations regarding students'
behaviour at the event. These
included one student reportedly
“vomiting all over [the] manager
A
fter further talks and
a 24 hour strike this
week, Jeremy Hunt
has announced that
controversial new junior doctor
contracts will be imposed on medics.
During talks between the
government and the BMA that
continued during Wednesday’s
strike, a “final deal” was rejected
by the doctors’ union. The BMA
have called it a “total failure on the
government’s part”.
On Thursday evening, junior
doctors, supportive members of
the public and medical students,
including the ICSMSU President
and the Deputy President of
Welfare attended at impromptu
protest outside the Department of
Health on Whitehall. They held
placards and reiterated that the
BMA would not stop fighting.
It is unclear where junior doctors
can go from here, but in a press
release, the chair of the junior
doctors committee for the BMA
said: “Junior doctors cannot and
will not accept a contract that is bad
while he was explaining to you
that the function was going to be
stopped due to the behaviour”.
The hotel also said there had been
damage to equipment, vomit found
in “corridors and staircases around
the hotel” and food thrown at staff.
Payment
came
straight from
the club’s
own account
for the future of patient care, the
profession and the NHS as a whole,
and we will consider all options
open to us.”
Assuming the government’s latest
offer was enforced on junior doctors,
the new system would be phased in
from August of this year. In his last
letter to the BMA,the government’s
contract negotiator, Sir David
Dalton, said this would be likely to
take 12 months to roll out across
all NHS Employers in England.
This means any medical students
graduating at the end of this year
would likely be immediately under
the new contract.
On Wednesday Sir Dalton advised
Jeremy Hunt to do “whatever
necessary” to conclude the dispute
after the BMA refused what he had
called an“improved offer”.Yesterday
the shadow health secretary, Heidi
Alexander, said Hunt’s “desire to
make these contract negotiations
into a symbolic fight for delivery
of seven-day services” had led to “a
situation which has been..."
