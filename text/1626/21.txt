This week you are still
struggling with your porn
addiction; however, you run
into some trouble as it has
started to slow down the
entire college wi-fi. IT send
you an email to please stop.

This week you gorge yourself
on pancakes to the extent
that you put on about 50
kilograms. After some
emergency liposuction, you
take this extra piece of fat
away and keep it as a pet.You
call it Cuthbert.
This week you hear debates
all over campus about a new
food craze so you decide
to have a go yourself. You
take some fuzzy-skinned
orange fruit and chill them
right down to a low low
temperature. Mmmmm,
freeze peach. Oh wait.
This week RAG have
wronged you so you summon
the all-powerful Storm
Imogen. However, the
meagre winds only serve
to delay the bungee jump
organised to collect money
for the children of Great
Ormond Street Hospital,and
RAG’s activities continue.
This week you discover that
your new fetish is putting
vegetables on top of your
boyfriend whilst having sex.
It starts with an innocent bell
pepper but by about week
four you just start just fucking
him with a butternut squash.
This week you complain
about college censorship.That
in itself leads to you being
censored, thus cancelling
out the original censorship
allowing free speech to reign.
Everybody wins!
This week you see your old
roommate from first year;
however, they are particularly
frosty towards you and you
have no idea why.Your friend
then reminds you that you
had a threesome in your
room whilst she was sleeping.
That’ll be it.
This week, under the stress of
the coursework that’s due in
on Monday, you start to have
vivid sex dreams about your
tutor. The next day in labs
you find it difficult to look
her in the eye as she passes
you a long, hard pipette and
tells you not to put the tip in.
This week after yelling out
your girlfriend’s mums name
during sex and then putting
it in the horoscopes, she is
not particularly happy. She
tells all her friends that it was
just a joke and it didn’t really
happen. But it did.
This week you try to infect
yourself with a tropical virus
in order to get out of doing
an exam; however, instead
of infecting yourself with
diphtheria you contract dick-
offtheria and your penis falls
off. Okay it’s a bit weak but
go with it.
This week you manage to
acquire a copy of the banned
RAG mag from a guy who
knows a guy. College officials
hunt you down and you finish
the remainder of the term in
Guantanamo Bay. Hey, at
least it's a shorter commute
than Woodward.
This week, you ban yourself.
You're banned. No more you.
But now everyone wants
you. You can't deal with all
this attention, so you try and
become less controversial.
But now you're just a boring
A5 leaflet of a man. Sad.
HOROSCOPES
Monday 8th February
Dear Diary,
My uncle once said that “With great power comes
great responsibility.” I've been in this position for
more than half a year and only now am I beginning
to feel the power surge through me. It's like ecstasy
flowing through my veins. I thought I was the chosen
one; that I would destroy the union and its endless
bureaucracy, not join them. During those sleepless
nights, I always ask myself the same question: am I
truly transparent?
Have I broken the sacred promise of my manifesto?
In the history books will they remember me as the
translucent one?
Thursday 11th February
Dear Diary,
Today I realised (again) that I'm not ready for
a world outside of university. My delusions of
grandeur earlier in the week have finally subsided.
Mum and dad said I can't come and live at home
with them after that last incident so I guess I have
no other choice but to run for a sabbatical position
again. What shall I be Deputy President of this
time? The DP of Love? The sad, lonely faces I see
when I walk to the Library to pick up a copy of the
university “newspaper” weigh heavy on my heart.
I wish I could help. Maybe, I’ve finally found my
cause.
