Medics Combine for Freshers' Week Frolics
My dear readers, how are? Survived fresh-
ers' week did we. I hope that you are
feeling better than I am because this
intrepid observer of the perfect micro-
cosm of the world that is IC has a severe
case of freshers flu brought on by a truly
hectic social calendar.
The last week has been rather fun
with starting for me with the debauchery
that was the Mary's campus road show.
The night started well when I was
expelled from DB's where I was attend-
ing a friend's birthday. The second most
upsetting thing about that was that I was
not even close to being under the influ-
ence, even by IC stewards' puritanical
standards. After deciding that I was too
out numbered to fight the point I headed
with some of the other expellees to
Mary's to witness the aftermath of the
road show. At this point I have to con-
gratulate the so far anonymous freshers
who participated in the
nightmare that was the
egg race. In the end the
night ended prema-
turely due to a slight miss calculation as
to the amount that I had to drink. Inci-
dentally, I would like to say to any of the
people that I spoke to on Tuesday and
have subsequently seen that it was nice
talking to you.
Wednesday saw the start of the Char-
ing Cross hosted events that kicked off
with the pub-crawl. I was co-opted to lead
some of the brave souls who had taken
their life into their hands and headed out
to enjoy the delights of the OSP, Distillers,
Finnegan's and the William Morris. The
ended well at the Rutland and Anchor
and here I witnessed a classic example
of how confusing the union between
CXW and SMI I can be. The night was
ending on a boisterous note (the best
Nick Newton
sort) with two groups
of would-be buskers
politely explaining to
the other group in
voices that would make patrons of the
Royal Opera I louse weep that Mary's
was better than The Cross and vice-versa.
Seasoned observers will at this point be
clearing their collective throats in prepa-
ration to say something along the lines
of "Well, what else is new" but the con-
fusing thing was that the while the songs
were partisan the groups were notl
Thursday saw the bop at Charing
Cross, an event with the theme of togas
and Tequila. Perhaps not the most obvi-
ous combination but an entertaining
one if only for the boring people, among
whom I include myself, who did not
wear togas who got to have a laugh at
the expense of those who did. Once
again alcohol was consumed and the
less said the better.
Finally my attention was drawn to the
delightful/sickening letter of praise to
Andy I leeps that was published in the
last issue of Felix. Opinions ranged from
"what a lovely thought" to "what does this
want off Andy?" I myself have mixed
views. Admittedly the letter was perhaps
a little too fawning in its praises but the
thought appeared genuine. National
papers have turned the art of knocking
politicians into a full time occupation
and on the occasions that people do a
good job their achievements are often
played down due to other factors.
Regardless of whether or not you think
that Andy did a good job overall it is
pleasing to see that someone had the
manners to say thank you and to show
their appreciation. Perhaps, this will set
a precedent for the future, one can only
hope.
How to Make Americana
For the benefit of all those of you living
out there in post Basics food hell or
those of you who started the year with
a crate of baked beans, I am here. Come
forth from those dark corners of mouldy
cheese and half eaten pies. Do not hes-
itate. Step into the kitchen and bond
with your cooker.
Since it is nearly impossible to find a
student who doesn't own a truckload of
pasta and a tin of tomatoes, a good
place to start our journey through cook-
ery land is Italy (a country who's chefs
seem to have students in mind). Ameri-
cana is a popular pasta sauce (tomatoes
and bacon) which with a little skill and
inspiration is pure magic. My own per-
sonal additions to the dish are red pep-
per and tuna but this is not essential. For
two people you will require:
1 red onion
*" 1 red pepper
*• Vi lb. Tomatoes
*• some garlic
*• a red chilli
»• lots of bacon
fresh herbs; parsley, chervil....
A tin of tuna
juice of half a lemon
«• 6 or 7 capers (If you Include tuna)
Start by finely chopping all the ingre-
dients. The easiest way to do this with the
pepper is to chop off the top and bottom
and slice open the cylinder. Once this has
been done you can run a knife along the
inside and remove the seeds and white
gunk in one go.
Now to cook. On a moderate flame,
heat a good amount of olive oil in a pan rather than dominates the end result so
and saute off the red pepper, onion and don't go overboard. After a minute add
bacon. Be generous
with the oil because it
will take on all the
flavours you add to the
pan and then coat the
pasta.
When the bacon
is beginning to crisp
up add the garlic and
Burning
Water
the chopped tomato
(minus the seeds),
capers and some
black pepper. You may
not need much salt
because of the bacon,
so it's best to add that
at the end.
Cook on for just a
chilli. Don't be too liberal, as the chilli is minute, to avoid loosing the fresh taste
designed to act as a seasoning in this of the tomato and add the flakes of tuna
dish. It pulls together the other flavours and lemon juice. The lemon will lighten
the dish and clean the palette. Once the
tuna is hot serve with the pasta of your
choice.
In a restaurant I worked in over the
summer we'd use fresh tuna steaks and
set them on top of the pasta with a little
tapenade (black olive puree). I lowever,
if that sounds a little too Masterchef for
you, don't worry - either way it Is delicious
so enjoy eating like people in the real
world for once.
