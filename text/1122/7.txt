Reform the CCUs or
lose them
Dear Felix
By now I am sure that many will have
heard how the RCSU has lost yet another
officer. I refer to myself for I have just
resigned from the post of VP(Education
& Welfare).
My reasons for this are as follows;
1) I am fed up with the way in which
my CCU was run - with no offence
intended to the VPs but Will and Bob arc
two ICSF members with very little outside
contact.
2) I need to get a good degree (as
a disabled person it is harder for me to
get work) and the Union takes too much
of my time.
Now I am not saying that the CCUs
should be abolished, just reformed a bit.
All that CCUs should do is provide ents
for students. All people 'care' about
today is IC as a whole and their depart-
ments. I have had discussions with many
people about this and have the follow-
ing plans.
All the leaders of the departmental
societies should group together to pro-
vide events for students, such as nights
out - paintball, etc. Welfare should be left
to ICU and the new fifth sabbatical -
under this should be a set of dep-reps
and welfare officers who have had some
welfare training and advice.
I leave the floor open to debate...

Dear Ed,
Do my tired old eyes deceive me? Can
it be true that that leviathan of student
journalism, Simon Baker, is recycling tired
old columns? I refer, of course, to said
corespondent's dreadful cut-and-paste
job in his first essay under your blos-
soming command. There are those of us
with longer memories, filled not with tri-
fles such as chemistry, who can place at
least two paragraphs from the freshers'
piece that appeared verbatim in its equiv-
alent last year. Perhaps it was not the
work of the real Simon Baker? An
inspired computer programme generat-
ing reams of self-indulgent dross without
the worry of a decent PhD to distract it
from its deadlines? Why of course not,
no "AI-SB" could be perfect. But where
is the real Simon Baker? I feel that we
ought to be told.
Yours with genuine concern,
Simon Baker's Number One Fan,
No Fixed Abode
The real Simon Baker has been spotted
on several occasions this term, mostly In
Southside Bar. As for the use of a com-
puter, don't you think If I had written an
'Al-SB' program it would have cut and
pasted with more subtlety? - Ed

Freedom at last!
My friends, I have been saved. No
longer must I fill a half-page editorial
with my complaints and gripes about
the world - a mere three columns is all
that stands between me and a finished
third issue! My thanks go out to all the
Felix team who have made this week so
much easier than the last few, especially
David Roberts (for being editor of all-
things-no-onc-clse-wants-to-touch), and
Joel Lewis (for allowing me to get a quick
pint or two in on Wednesday evening).
Not only does this state of affairs allow
mc lo grab back some of my limited
social life, it also means that you hear less
from me and more from normal (i.e. not
graduated - ha ha!) students. Still, it's
5am and there's space to fill, so...
Does anyone care?
The answer is almost certainly no but,
never one to be cynical, I'll persevere
anyway. As Felix went to print, there
were still no candidates for DP(C&S), and
from what I hear some of the Council
positions weren't exactly over subscribed
either. I would be hypocritical if I said I
was any different from most IC students
- two years ago I didn't care about Union
politics, and hardly noticed when elec-
tions came around. The biggest effect
it had on me was the lack of Lnts on hus-
tings night in dB's. But surely some
more mature (i.e. less socially active
and/or CV developing) students want to
get involved? I did, and now I get paid
to sit here in the early morning... okay, I
can see your point.
Sex sex sex!
Now I've got your attention... I honestly
do want to talk about sex. It seems to
be about this time, when the term set-
tles down, that first years (no longer
freshers) have to accept that Imperial is
not a good place to find a partner. I say
partner because I feel that this is just as
true for women as men at IC, although
I'm sure plenty of guys out there would
disagree. There's not a lot of point sit-
ting in your room/bar/ctc complaining
about il, though - Cameron Diaz is hardly
likely to turn up in Linstead Hall one
evening. My patronising bit of advice this
week is for all those 'single and not lik-
ing it' people - get out and enjoy life or
stop whining. As for me? Oh dear, I
seem to have run out of space... Ed
