No Score Given
A poor start by IC saw Brunei score an
extremely lucky try within three min-
utes. Imperial came back with two tries
due to the skill of Jamie "Superman"
Duggin. While Jamie waited for his well
deserved hat-trick, Telfor "the French
Welshman" Beynon squeezed in
another try.
Imperial should have capitalised on
the favourable slope in the second half,
but instead Brunei closed the gap. This
only fired up the IC machine and helped
Telfor run in his second try while Dan
'Pharaoh' I ligazi used his hydraulic rams
to push a couple over. There was some
great bashing from Chucko, which was
extremely entertaining and deserves a
mention.
Overall, open play and tackling was
good, whilst set plays need working
on. IC played skilful rugby, especially
considering it was the beginning of the
season, although some scrappy play let
Brunei keep the scorelinc respectable.
2nd XV
IC34 -14 BRUNEL
After an aggressive start which sawjohn
Stevenson crash over the line for his first
big try for IC within five minutes, the
scene was set. Constant forward dom-
ination saw the scrum half, Yuen Lewis,
sneak In under the defence for the sec-
ond try. Before the completion of
twenty minutes, J.tenner displayed
superior pace down the line to score.
Committed defending frustrated
the early Brunei attacks, and the first half
was wrapped up with Jimbo speeding
down the line to score and then con-
verting.
[he second half saw a poor start for
IC with Brunei scoring an easy try straight
after kick off. Imperial soon woke up
and came straight back with Jimbo scor-
ing just as easily. Poor discipline let
Brunei score again, and they converted
it easily. Strong forward play and pace
sawjohn Stevenson score his second,
finishing off as he had begun. The final
whistle gave IC their first victory and a
promising start to the BUSA season.
Imperial athlete
goes to World
Championships
Tarik Djeddour of the cycling and run-
ning clubs represented Great Britain this
summer on the World Short Course
Duathlon Championships, in St. Wendel,
South Germany. The event attracted a
thousand athletes from as far afield as
Australia and the USA. The event com-
prised a 10km run followed by a 40km
bike ride and finished with a further
5km run. The course was very hilly and
wet, and Tarik's time of 2hrs11 minutes
saw him finishing 21st out of 60 in his
age group of 20-24 (3rd placed Briton).
Both Tarik and Hadlcy Skelton (19)
competed in the National Duathlon
Championships in June and finished 4th
and 2nd respectively in their age groups.
This gave them automatic selection for
the World Championships. Unfortu-
nately Hedley could not compete at the
Worlds due to lack of finances.
Tarik has already been pre-selected
to compete in the World Middle Dis-
tance Duathlon Championships in
Switzerland in 1999 and is aiming to
get a top 5 position. Hedley is looking
forward to qualifying again and com-
peting in his first World Championships
in 1999.
Boat Club
T'was the crack of dawn and all through
the land not a creature was stirring.... but
for a megaphone, some launches and
a few IC top squad boats fighting up the
river. 6.30am and those hardy men and
women of the college were on the first
morning session of the year. Last year's
season was capped off in true ICBC
style, with three boats qualifying for the
Henley Royal Regatta. IC won the Tem-
ple Challenge cup (the international stu-
dent Vllls event), were finalists in the
Visitors' Cup (the top international stu-
dent IVs event), narrowly losing to
Oxford's top IV, while the "bottom" IC
crew pushed the University of London's
top boat all the way to the line, also in
the Visitors' Cup. Ihe Henley perfor-
mances reflected IC's yearlong domi-
nance, in both the men's and women's
squads heading the University league
tables and becoming BUSA champions.
The current £1.7 million redecoration of
the boat house will be completed in
several months time and should house
the huge intake in novice and experi-
enced oarsmen and women who have
recently started this season's training.
The new boathousc has been desig-
nated a "centre of excellence" by the
amateur rowing association - one of
only three in Britain and the only one in
London, which should help maintain
the club's results.
2nd XI
LSE 3 - 5 IC
tor many 1st years this was a debut for
IC and for the rest it was a long awaited
return to the new football season.
The match started in the worst pos-
sible fashion with LSE scoring twice in
the first 10 minutes. The first goal came
from the penally spot, from a decision
that seemed to confuse even the LSt
team. After that setback, IC fought back
well. G.I.Joules took a free kick from just
outside the box, which he blasted past
the wall and into the top corner. LSE
dominated the rest of the half, but only
led 2-1 at half time.
The second half started In the best
possible fashion, with another awful rcf-
ereeing decision giving us a penalty for
a foul outside the box (who's com-
plaining?). Once again G.I.Joules was
there to put away the spot kick, but the
best was still to come. The superb
G.I.Joules (guess who's the captain?)
picked up the ball 25 yards out and with
his weaker left foot, he drove the ball
into the top corner, hitting the bar on its
way in. IC was now well in control and
from a giant kick from IC's very impres-
sive keeper, Dave headed a "Wimble-
don style" goal past the opposition
keeper. The next goal came from a
flowing move down the right and
ended with a superb header from" liny"
Martin - the smallest man on the pitch.
LSE got a goal back, but a convinc-
ing win to start the season should give
us confidence for a very successful sea-
son. Report by C.Batley
Hockey
IC I 4 - 2 ROYAL FREE I
The tentative start was put down to the
day being a big day for England. IC were
also in need of a good win to get the
season off in style. IC were 1-0 down at
half time. Noddy's storming run and
swan dive led to a penalty, which was
duly buried by Big Titties for the first goal
of season. A fantastic second half per-
formance followed, with the whole
team firing on all cylinders, most having
played together last season.
IC's second goal was crucial as it
broke the will of Royal Free. A good final
result was achieved after Fluffy Cherub
managed to bundle two flukey balls
over the line. Many thanks to the
umpires, a sterling job, well done.
