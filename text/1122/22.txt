The Future's Bright, the Future's Pink?
No-one at Imperial will need the stats
from a college census to work out that
Imperial isn't exactly brimming with girls.
And why should it be - it's a college of sci-
ence, technology and medicine - the
solid territory of gangly beardy types who
wear rock T-shirts to interviews. But
before the more touchy of Imperial's
males start moaning, spare a thought for
the rarer sex. With the obstacles that
exist, it's no wonder there are so few
women in science and engineering.
Next week, on Imperial College Radio, I'll
be looking at what is being done to
redress the balance. That's in the News
Show, from 7-8pm on 999kHz AM.
When it comes to working in acad-
emia, success is all about papers pub-
lished and funding won. Yet according
to research published last year in top
science journal, Nature, women have to
be far more productive than men to
stand any chance of reaching the top.
The study, which looked at the success
of grant applications to the Swedish Med-
ical Research Council, found that women
had to be 2.5 times better, in terms of
citations and numbers of papers pub-
lished, to have the same chance of win-
ning a grant as their male colleagues.
The reasons for such a horrendous
disparity are open to speculation, but
undoubtedly plain sexism plays a role.
Professor Susan Greefleld, who holds a
Chair at Oxford University and has
recently been appointed as the first
woman Director of the Royal Institution,
was championing the cause of women
in science at the recent Labour Party
conference. "What I found perhaps
encapsulated the mood of the limes,"
she said, " was not only the enthusiasm
the people on the floor had for women
in science, but afterwards I was sitting
next to a delegate, who'll remain name-
less, over dinner and he said, 'The prob-
lem with you clever women is you scare
me.' And I think that, more than anything
sums up the nebulous problem."
Sexism aside, there are inherent
aspects of academic life that have tradi-
tionally hindered women in their careers.
Anyone who takes time off to start a
family will find themselves severely dis-
advantaged when they return, says Pro-
fessor Greenfield. "Science research is
one of the very few careers, unlike med-
icine or spot-welding or whatever, where
if you don't work for two years it's very
hard to return at a senior level because
if you don't publish you're dead." The
result is that more and more young
women are leaving science altogether as
soon as they finish their degrees, and
more end up in teaching than in any
other single profession.
The huge imbalance of sexes in sci-
ence and engineering has been ringing
alarm bells for some time and earlier
this month, AWiSL, the Association for
Women in Science and Lngineering,
launched a website to provide informa-
tion for women interested in academic
or industrial careers in science and
related fields. President of the London
branch of AWiSL is Imperial's own Pro-
fessor Julia Higgins. "There's an AWiSL
branch at Imperial and it's a friendly way
of getting to know other people in the
college, other women at various levels
and it works as a good network. I would
suggest, at the very least, getting in
touch on email."
The AWiSL website can be found at
www.awise.org and at Imperial, Dr Alison
Payne, Chair of the London branch can
be contacted at a.j.payne@ic.ac.uk. To
