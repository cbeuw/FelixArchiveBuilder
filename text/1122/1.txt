Death Knell for the NUS?
U
MIST and Imperial College Stu-
dents' Unions are to hold a con-
ference on surviving outside the
NUS later this month. It is thought that
the event will be attended by Union offi-
cers from many of Britain's top universi-
ties.
The conference will take place on 30
October at UMIST, and has been unoffi-
cially titled 'CHESA: The Way of the
Future', CHESA being the 'Coalition of
Higher Education Student Associations'.
It will take place in the afternoon and will
be an informal affair, consisting of
speeches and discussion. Speakers
include David Hellard (ICU President),
Sabih Behzad (UMIST Union President)
and Nick Bibby (St Andrew's Student
Association President).
UMIST is currently in the process of
disaffiliating from the NUS, although
by Ed Sexton
technically it is still a
member. The decision
to disaffiliate this academic year was
made some months ago but, accodring
to Sabih Behzad, the formal announce-
ment will not be made until 4 November.
The NUS has asked UMIST to hold a uni-
versity-wide referendum on the issue
before disaffiliating, which would be sim-
ilar to the procedure followed when
Imperial voted to leave the NUS almost
twenty years ago.
The conference was initially a joint
venture between UMIST's Students'
Union and ICU. Help has since been
received from Northern Services, a buy-
ing consortium which many non-NUS
affiliated Scottish Universities use. Nick
Bibby, who is a member of the Northern
Services Executive, explained that the
group could match the NUS on most
prices, and sometimes
improve on them. I le also
claimed that Northern Services offers
"more flexibility", as universities can use
other service providers as well (a scheme
prohibited to NUS members). "One of
the advantages is it I Northern Services]
is quite small" explained Mr Bibby. I le
denied he was going to the conference
simply to promote Northern Services. "I
am keen lo allow impartial decisions... I
am not going down there to slag off
another organisation" he responded.
Sabih Behzad was also quick to deny
the conference was an attempt lo break
up the NUS. "We are not forcing people
to leave", he explained, "we are there lo
discuss what the benefits arc of staying,
and what the benefits are of leaving". He
thoughtfully added "Universities have
left... and not suffered. I Leaving] can
save an awful lot of money".
David I lellard, while still insisting that
Ihe conference was a forum for exchang-
ing ideas, was more forceful in his criti-
cism of the NUS. "UMIST leaving has got
people thinking" he commented; "there
is a growing discontent with the service
Ihey [the NUS] arc providing". Dave Hel-
lard explained that his role at the con-
ference would be informing other
universities of "how well we do outside
the NUS". When asked which other uni-
versities would be attending the confer-
ence Dave I lellard was unwilling to
specify names, but did say that a lot of
people were going, and that all the insti-
tutions involved were "very, very good".
A representative from the NUS thought
ii "strange lhat Imperial is talking to
UMIST". Nick Bibby's final comment was
"it's all looking quite fun".
Where Did
Those
Buses Go?
by Duncan Hill
A
fter a successful freshers' fair,
Wednesday afternoon arrived, and
everyone involved with the clubs
began to arrive at their various meeting
points to commence with their first ses-
sions of the year. Events like team trials
were arranged in far and distant parts of
London, and as befits any new year at
Imperial college, the buses didn't arrive.
In total five clubs were affected by this
unfortunate oversight on the part of the
bus company; Tenpin Bowling, IC Rugby,
IC Football (Mens and Womens), IC
Hockey, RSM Football and RSM Rugby.
Of course none of them were pleased
with the situation they faced, having to
take public transport to Harlington, as
well as the obvious losses in attendance;
Men's Hockey lost up to fifty percent of
the turnout for the team trials.
While it was loo late to arrange
buses by the time the clubs had started,
even though the Union were not at fault,
it was the Clubs and Societies Adminis-
trator who remedied the situation with
the swift organisation of return buses.
The bus company was apologetic and
sliced £50 of the bill for hiring buses in
future (which have risen from £105 to
£180) but this will not stop them losing
:
another company over the hiring of
buses for these clubs. II is hoped this
unfortunate incident has not set a prece-
denl for the future.
A witty young man visibly demonstrates the lack of buses on Prince Consort Rd.
