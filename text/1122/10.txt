Jacob Stringer investigates the US bombing of Sudan and
asks: Do the ends really justify the means?
In August of this year the US, with the full
support of Mr Tony Blair and various
other Western governments, launched
air strikes against supposed terrorist tar-
gets in Afghanistan and Sudan. It appears
that the attacks In Afghanistan may have
been justified but the attack on Khartoum
needs to be looked at more closely. At
the time the only really vocal pro-
testers against this attack were
Sudan and Pakistan, who were
summarily dismissed by the
press as being too prejudiced for
their opinions to be
of any value. JÂ£
Six weeks ,
have passed
since the bomt
ings, and the sit
uation can
looked at more <
tivcly. The US launched an
unprovoked attack on a
weaker country, without
even talking to the country
first, without discussing it
in the UN, without having any solid evi-
dence to show that the supposed offend-
ers were guilty of any crime. The attack
was on a civilian target, where it was
known that the majority of people were
innocent and had no way of defending
themselves. There is still no evidence to
justify the attack.
I believe we gener-
ally call such an attack T h e CHITieS OF the g
sad news for you. America does not
have the good of the world at heart; the
American government has only re-elec-
tion concerns at heart (Yes, even in
Northern Ireland, though they m,
have done some good) and it
is time to stop pretending
otherwise.
The
main rea-
sons the US is
so hated in the
idle East are the
ued military pres-
ence in Saudi Arabia and
the political, financial and mil-
itary support of Israel. About the
former I know little, but this sum-
mer I visited Israel and the West Bank. I
was there for a matter of weeks only, but
had time to reach some pretty strong
conclusions. The Israeli governmental
policies condone and allow human rights
abuses to an extent which would be
condemned universally if it were not for
the support provided by the US. The
institutionalised discrimination against
Palestinians has been described by Rev.
Desmond Tutu as 'worse than apartheid'.
The crimes of the Israeli
overnmcnt include
Israeli _
include theft of
either a declaration of
war or terrorism. It wasn't
the first. Thank you Tony
for showing your strength
by supporting such
heroes. Well done, we land and hOITieS
salute your noble stand
against terrorism, rule Britannia and kiss
Clintons butt.
Now, these air strikes were in retal-
iation for the bombing of US embassies.
Why would anyone want to do that?
Surely America is the moral pillar of the
western world, is our mentor and guide
and wishes us no harm? Why would any-
one want to bomb them? I have some
theft of land and homes,
OVemment demolition of inhabited
houses, torture of pris-
oners, imprisonments
without trial, settling of
occupied territories, for-
bidding people to travel
freely within their own country and,
recently, lack of real interest in the peace
process. These policies arc not new and
arc not secret. The Israeli government,
despite repeated condemnation by the
UN and human rights organisations,
have even intensified policies such as
home demolition since the so-called
peace process began. They have no
intention in the near future of being any
more accommodating to the land's
indigenous population. Israel is a coun-
try that should not be sup-
ported by any country that
purports to protect freedom,
democracy and human rights,
nstead it deserves the same treat-
ment meted out to South Africa during
the Apartheid years. There is no excuse
for the US, Britain or anyone else to
maintain friendships with it.
So the alternative to air strikes for the
US? The condemnation of the state of
Israel for its appaling and continuing
record of human rights abuses. At this
point the best thing for the US to do
would be to end all its activities in the
Middle East and go home to try and sort
out who they should be supporting and
who they should not be. Britain too
needs to take a very serious look at its
policies in the Middle East, and think
very carefully about what history will say
about it, before it makes any further
moves.
Just for the record, I do not support
the activities of Palestinian terrorists, but
after spending time with Palestinians in
the West Bank I began to sympathise
with them and began to understand why
the terrorists do what they do.
