ADDRESSING THE CENTURY: 100 YEARS OF ART AND FASHION
Hayward Gallery, South Bank
H
ot on the heels of London Fash-
Ion Week comes this exhibition
exploring
the relationship
between the inter-
mingling worlds of
art and fashion dur-
ing the course of
the twentieth cen-
tury. Including over
250 works ranging
from actual cos-
tumes to films, pho-
tographs and
illustrations, the col-
lection emphasises
the aesthetic com-
ponent of fashion.
The five gal-
leries are arranged
in chronological
order: 1/ Decoration
- The New Century,- \
21 Function - The 1
Post-war Years; 3/ 1
Fantasy - Dreams in
I lard Times; 4/ Per-
formance - The
Years of Re-inven-
tion and 5/ Convergence - Post-modern
Times. As with most social phenomena,
the milestones of fashion often coin-
cide with cultural movements and surges
of political upheaval. During the feminist
explosion at the
turn of the century
for instance, the
French couturier
Paul Poiret revolu-
tionised the style of
emancipated
females by discard-
ing the dreaded
corset.
Over the years,
the accent in fash-
ion has shifted dra-
matically from the
elegant and deco-
rative to the func-
tional, from the
practical to the orig-
inal yet blatantly
unwearable. Nowa-
days, modern artists
relish the "shock
factor" their clothes
inspire. In order to
stand out from the
crowd, designers
are continually
searching for innovative materials from
which to mould their obscure and extrav-
agant creations. Honeycomb shoes,

human hair neck-
laces are just the tip
of the iceberg
when it comes to
the weird and won-
derful objects on
display.
In an effort to
encourage visitor
participation, the
organisers have set
up an interactive
Dressing Room. The
public is given a
rare opportunity to
try on specially com-
missioned gar-
ments and
accessories con-
ceived by talented
students on the
fashion scene.
Signs proudly
announcing
"Touching allowed!"
certainly make fot a welcome and
refreshing alternative to the traditional
attitude of museums.
The exhibition does not pretend or
even attempt to portray an exhaustive
[tTwiJillii1
history of these
. " _ twin industries,
•
' focussing instead
on the highlights of
the collaboration
between artists and
designers. So, if you
secretly consider
yourself a budding
John Galliano, feel
like following in the
footsteps of Vivi-
enne Westwood or
simply show an
interest in fashion,
then the I layward
Gallery is well-worth
a visit.

AUBREY BEARDSLEY
Victoria and Albert Museum
T
he first few prints and caricatutes
featured in this exhibition reveal
that Aubrey Eieardsley was an ele-
gant man with a definitively artistic hair-
style. I lis brief period of creative
precedence began in 1892 when Beard-
sley was just 20 years old. Over five years.
he generated an urbane style which was
so inspirational that it was re-awakened
as 1960's chic. The exhibition charters the
life of Beardsley following the progres-
sion of his work and relating the influ-
ence imposed on him by current affairs.
As a newcomer to London, Beards-
ley had to balance an office job along-
side his real passion and as a result
worked late into the night, sketching
and hatching by the light of a candle. The
absence of colourful stimulus is reflected
in his pieces that are generally neutral;
black ink on white paper. However, the
intricacy of the fine lines which assemble
many of the exhibits are far from bland.
The vibrancy of the flowers in Siegfried
Act 2 and his ability to fill a scene with tiny
details allow you to absorb more than the
depicted situation from his work. It is
likely that it was this capacity which
induced many publishers such as L.J.M.
Dent to call on him to illustrate their
magazines, books and posters.
Beardsley, on the other hand, liked
to view situations from an unusual per-
spective. One of his earlier works, The
Entombment, depicts the body of Christ
being taken down from the cross, an
event that is rarely considered by other
modern artists. I lis appreciation of tra-
ditional Japanese art is also shown and
the flowing lines of oriental elegance
appear as a natural evolution for his
style.
Beardsley became restless with his
mythical subjects and in an attempt to
pacify him, Dent brought out the Bon-
Mot series, small books of illustrations
and anecdotes. Yet this only served to
fuel Beardsley's desire to unravel the
society of his time, I le found similar aspi-
rations in the intellect of Oscar Wilde
and they struck up a friendship when
Beardsley illustrated Wilde's book
Salome Later, by means of a more dar-
ing publisher, they worked together on
a magazine called The Yellow Book
whose contents sparked outrage
amongst the upper classes due to their
suggestions of society's decadence, this
satire seems quite harmless now, in the
present climate of free expression and,
in fact, protests were not heard when, in
one issue, Beardsley submitted work
under an assumed name. Perhaps some
of the scandal surrounding these designs
was caused by reputation rather than
content.
When Wilde was sent to prison,
Beardsley experienced a time of extreme
hardship, amplified by the progression of
the consumption, which finally ended his
life. After several other projects Beards-
ley began a period in which his work took
on a gentlet tone, using washes to off-
set the harsh ink lines, lie also com-
pleted some ornate baroque studies.
These are remarkably detailed consider-
ing the state of his health at the time. The
final exhibits prove that right up until his
very last days, Beardsley was generating
fresh ideas and this makes his premature
death at 25 years of age such a tragedy.
