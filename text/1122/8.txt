Flowers and a Federal Europe
Cowboys and Cabbages
Dahlias and pasonies. You can't beat
'em. Classic English look. A liberal sprin-
kling of potash in the spring and dead
head carefully. I'm sorry, wrong column.
It is a little known fact that I am the gar-
dening correspondent for The Cleethor-
pes Evening Argus, and all this talk of
flowerbeds is getting me confused. I
shall say little more of it, since it has
mostly been said by others. I lowever,
there is some scope for recouping the
disgracefully large cost when I ler Majesty
has departed. The traffic in South Ken is,
of course, dreadful, and it seems fair
that the College should do its bit to alle-
viate the congestion. Season ticket loans
are an excellent idea, but other forms of
transport should be encouraged. I doubt
I am the first to suggest it, but the
flowerbed could be grassed, thus afford-
ing the perfect venue for tethering
horses. It has already been suggested
that IC employs a lot of cowboys, so the
take up for such a scheme should be
high. Environmentally sound - the Rec-
tor's roses would come on a treat - and
forward thinking. The best traditions of
Imperial. Alternatively, we could address
another problem, while still maintaining
a splash of colour. A vegetable patch. Car-
rots, cauliflowers and runner beans
would look superb against the backdrop
of the library, and the produce upon har-
vest could be used by Catering in order
that their catastrophically bad losses be
mitigated. A lovely idea, I hear you cry,
but on quiet reflection it has a weakness.
To make headway on the parlous state
of Catering's finances would probably
require the conversion of the I larlington
sportsground into a market garden cum
cattle ranch. Never mind.
Eurotrash
We, or rather the rest of Europe, have less
than 90 days until the birth of EMU.
Some may greet this with wide-eyed
anticipation, miffed that the UK won't be
at the christening. As regular readers will
know, I am probably not in that group.
From the days of the ill-fated ERM, which
led to this country's severest recession
since the 30s, the whole idea of a Euro-
pean dream founded on a single cur-
rency has filled me with unease. The
two previous attempts to unify Europe, by
Napoleon and I litler, were not without
their problems, but some feel that hav-
ing a crack at the old idea by peaceful
means may be more successful. The two
obvious questions are: why do it and
will it work? The first seems to have been
dodged by many involved, which is wor-

Voice of
rying since it is clearly linked to the sec-
ond.
France and Germany do have an
answer to the
first point. The
problem is
that they are
not so much
different as
totally unre-
lated. The
French have,
since the
1960s, had a
powerful
desire to cre-
ate a currency
to rival the
dollar, which
would give
them a
greater say in
world affairs
while reduc-
ing the rote of
Uncle Sam.
The proposal
was never sul-
lied with anything so base as economic
arguments as is the norm in Gallic poli-
tics. The Germans' motives are more
altruistic. They believe that surrendering
some of the sovereignty inherent in hav-
ing the principal currency of Europe will
further reinforce their desire to co-exist
peacefully with their neighbours. While
highly laudable, it is still predominantly
political. So we have the two senior part-
ners suggesting a complete overhaul of
the European economy for reasons that
have little to do with national economic
wellbeing. Then we have the Italians. To
the Bundesbank's credit, they have made
no secret of their desire to admit Italy
when, and only when, I lei! freezes over.
Only last week the Italian Prime Minister
was forced to resign in a confidence
debate after the Communists refused to
accept an adherence to tight fiscal con-
trol post-1999. Once they're in the Euro
club, they plan to get straight back to
their old ways, which have been so thor-
oughly discredited.
The whole project has become politi-
cised. The French want a say in how the
Central Bank operates, which makes a
mockery of it, and bodes very ill for the
stability of the currency. But even if the
French don't upset the apple-cart, will it
work? This is where we get to the heart
of the matter. Barely a day goes by with-
out a plea from Britain's manufacturers'
to cut interest rates, yet the Bank of Eng-
land have been reluctant to act until
recently because of rising wages and
strong consumer demand in the South.
If we cannot set an interest rate that
meets the needs of London and Man-
chester, how on earth can it work across
the whole of continental Europe? I he
Irish, for example, will have to take 2.5%
off their rate,
at a time
when they
should be rais-
ing rates to
stop inflation.
If they are not
careful, the
Irish economy
will implode.
Not only will
governments
lose the abil-
ity to set their
interest rates,
but their free-
dom to set
taxes and
expenditure
will diminish.
This is already
happening.
When Gordon
Brown wished
to repeal VAT
on fuel, he was told that this was illegal
under European law. The French have
been getting twitchy for some years
about so-called 'fiscal dumping.' Some
might prefer the term 'fiscal prudence',
since they are terrified that their exces-
sive tax regime will persuade French
companies to move to lower tax coun-
tries in Euroland. Rather than put their
house in order, they would prefer that
this is banned. The problem in Britain is
that the arguments have concentrated
on political issues such as losing the
pound. While extremely valid, there are
more important factors. Taken together,
we are best out of it.
A Good Word for Estates?
Newer, and some older, readers may
thinkthat my opinion of the Estates Divi-
sion is not terribly high. While their capac-
ity for mucking it up makes my life as a
columnist far easier than it should be,
ihey do occasionally get it right. I haven't
seen the dB's extension yet, but I did
stroll pass the JCR yesterday. I must say
it is amazing what they have done with
the shed that used to be the focal point
for undergraduates on campus. Con-
gratulations to all involved. If only this
happened more often...
