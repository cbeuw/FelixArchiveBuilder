So how did the elections go guys? Was gona
watch results on da nets, but I realised I’m 2 eps
behind on Glee!
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
FFS! Dey’ve made it so u can’t watch me teabag-
ging ur dead corpse. I spose dat’s a good thing
for you Gor :p
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Elections? Who gives a shit about the elections?
Halo Reach beta is out! I’m gona get sum skunk
and jet-pack everywher with my sniper
SUPERACEGORTHEROAR87
stfu Osie :p just coz I teabagged ur Shelly at Co-
penhagen. Her face looks gud with my balls on
em lol! And Cammy - splits on the skunk?
A rant, a door, a panini and definitely no conclusion whatsoever
I
t’s safe to say that people piss me
off. You’re probably pissing me
off right now. I don’t know what
you’ve done, but you’re probably
one of those people who just has
a really annoying face. Or you have an
annoying laugh. Or an annoying face
twitch. Or you say ‘lmao’ like it’s a real
word. Or you like that fucking nauseat-
ing ‘Gap Yahh’ video and intermittent-
ly quote it hoping to get a cheap laugh.
What’s this? A sketch that exaggerates
an archetypal member of British soci-
ety, complete with an identifiable ver-
nacular and memorable catchphrase?
No-one has ever done this before! Bet-
ter make it my facebook status. Yeah
but, No but, yeah but this is never go-
ing to get stale!
Sorry, this is beginning to sound like
a rant. I’ve been slowly turning insane
from the surrounding horde of drool-
ing zombies who occasionaly gurgle,
‘I hate revision’ or ‘Who you going to
vote for?’. I resorted to talking to my
bedroom door, just for a change of
conversation. No, seriously, I actually
talked to my bedroom door. He likes
to read trashy horror novels and thinks
Family Guy is very mehh. He wishes he
had more time to see the kids.
The Election is like the Ashes – sud-
denly everybody knows everything
about cricket and won’t stop talking
about it. You can’t go anywhere with-
out people judging your every move. I
notice you have tomato in your panini,
so I guess you’re voting Labour. You
don’t have to shove your political sand-
wich in everybody’s face you know!
ALRIGHT! I’ll take the tomato out!
Oh I see, so now you don’t believe in
democracy. Are you a hippie? Are you
anti-capitalism? Don’t you care about
the future of our economy? Alright
fine, I’ll add some mustard! See, now
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Nah I’ll giv u sum on the house coz u let me use
ur face on my billboards lol. Me and Cleggman
r goin to Bestival this year. Ne1 else up 4 it?
I’m voting Lib Dem and this is my Lib
Dem panini. And I suppose you paid
for it with your 1% levy on my Dad’s
house. You know what, fuck it I’m
moving to North Korea.
On a lighter note, at least I no long-
er have to listen to celebrities singing
for Haiti. In fact, I’m pretty sure that
no-one talks about Haiti anymore. It’s
like it’s suddenly become a really un-
fashionable charity. I heard that Haiti
are releasing their own charity single
for the poor souls that were exposed to
the vile slaughter of REM’s ‘Everybody
Hurts’.
They would have made a lot more
money if they just gave us the ultima-
tum of money or charity single. OK!
Please take my money, take my house,
for God’s sakes just don’t make a ten-
minute-long cringe-worthy video of
Cheryl Cole, Susan Boyle and Rod
Stewart crying over news footage.
Procrastination Olympics
ULTIMATE FACEBOOK STALKING
Yeah, we all like to stalk random people we don’t know, but what about
the person sitting next to us in the library or computer room? Here’s
the game: Do whatever you can to find out the name of the person sit-
ting next to you. (You can’t sit next to your friends) Now open their
facebook page and just stare at it, or perhaps laugh at their status. Tilt
the screen slightly to esnure you ensure that your stalkee has clear view.
You get 1 point if they move away and double points if they file a re-
straining order.
DAWN OF THE ASIANS
That’s right, you’re trapped in a mall full of brain-
dead zombies, only this time, the mall is the Library
and the zombies are Asians. If you touch or make eye
contact with an Asian, you become infected and lose.
You’ll need a medikit, food supply and a shotgun.
Don’t forget to use your melee attack. I’ve lost too
many friends to Asians because they forgot their me-
lee attack. You can respawn at the cafe coke machine.
SAVING PRIVATE RYMAN
This is a great game for you and your
friends. The idea is to re-enact the
Ohama Beach landing with your sta-
tionary. Choose your teams (Gener-
ally your worst friends are nominated
as the Germans) and then find your
Tom Hanks HB pencil. Using pencil
cases as the landing boats and comput-
ers as German casemates (those turret
things) try to get your Tom Hanks HB
to your French Nemesis, who will be
launching every item of stationary they
have at you. For extra realism, bring
tomato ketchup for blood and perhaps
torch one of the computers if you have
time. You’ll need to use a mirror on a
stick like Tom Hank does. Just do eve-
rything Tom Hank does. Don’t let your
Tom Hanks HB die.
ULTIMATE REVISION
Wait a second! This doesn’t sound like a game that comes un-
der procrastination! That is unless you’re revising for a subject
that you’re not even taking! This game is so insanely badass
it practically seems stupid. Ultimate Revision has been cited
as the next base jumping and the new rush for thrill-seekers.
Get your mobile phone camera out, run up to someone and
then slap yourself in the face.
Send videos to hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
HAPPY ‘WTF?’ SLAPPING!
Every point you earn will be sent to Haiti. Not
translated to cash form or anything...just points
