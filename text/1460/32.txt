Ankit Patel Cricket
1st XI continue fine form
with another victory
I
C Cricket 1st XI travelled to
Harlington on Wednesday for
their BUCS fixture against Uni-
versity of Sussex 1st XI. With IC
losing the toss once again, Uni-
versity of Sussex elected to bat first.
The Sussex openers made a steady
start by accumulating 61 runs in 12
overs before Ankit Patel got one to
seam back in to get the Sussex captain
LBW. Navin Surtani made a break-
through with a slower ball which was
caught at mid off, sending the second
opener back to the pavilion. Soon after
IC brought on the first of three spin-
ners they employed during their time
in the field. Hasit Mehta bowled with
supreme accuracy; hitting the right
areas to make it incredibly difficult
to score. Coupled with tight fielding,
pressure began to build on the Sussex
middle order, which turned out to be
their downfall. Hasit picked up 4 wick-
ets for just 20runs in his 10 overs.
Tight bowling at the other end from
Rehan Ali and Pawan Patel didn’t let
Sussex get away. Rahul Pai continued
were Hasit left off, keeping the Pavilion
end tight, while at the M4 end Anirudh
Sompalli kept getting the odd wicket
as the end of the innings approached.
University of Sussex ended on 199-9
from their 50 overs.
In reply IC’s new and incredibly at-
tacking opener, Sompalli, dispatched
the second ball for four over extra cov-
er. In fact, he smacked it so hard that
despite 15 players looking for the it in
the sidelines, the brand new Readers
ball was not found. To Sompalli’s dis-

Imperial lost by 86 runs
gust, the umpire’s only option was to
use the old innings ball. Not concen-
trating, he skied the next ball high over
mid-off, who completed an impressive
catch over his shoulder. Matt attacked
in similar style to reach a quickfire 45,
taking 20 runs off one over which in-
cluded a huge six over midwicket. The
rest of the chase was fairly uneventful
with the IC batsman all contributing
but then getting out. Yasir Bin Riaz
(26), Ankit Patel (24) and Mehta (34)
all chipped in, until keeper and pre-
mier finisher Adam Hugill (50 not out)
calmly finished the chase in 37.5 overs.
****
After the 1 and a half hour minibus ride
to Brighton and arriving in time for
a novel pre-match warm up, Captain
Pete Swallow won the toss and decided
to bowl. President Andy Payne was
given the first over and had obviously
been watching the 2006/7 Ashes as
preparation, immitating Steve Harmi-
son and opening with a wide ball, be-
fore rectifying his shocking start with
six dot balls in a row. Shouldering re-
sponsibility, Swallow (2-15) took the
second over and things started to im-
prove as he soon bowled both openers
with firstly a cunning slower ball and
then a faster yorker. Things got even
better as Payne got in on the act with a
vicious lifter to hit the gloves and have
the batsman caught behind. To keep
the pressure high, Ian Woolf and Rajiv
Bhar were brought on and the wickets
continued to fall with Bhar eventually
taking 4-29.
Woolfy somehow managed to not
take a single wicket despite having the
slip cordon salivating for his entire 10
over spell. Sussex managed to steady
the ship near the end and progressed
to a large total. Fortunately, Payne (3-
39) and fresher Jonny Cooper man-
aged to take the remaining 3 wickets to
leave Imperial needing 169 to win.
With a second pair of openers in as
many matches, Imperial got off to a
slow start that turned sour with the
loss of the opening pair for single fig-
ures. In came Payne and Rohan Babla,
who managed to get the innings going
with a 50 partnership.
The stand was dominated by Payne,
with an innings of 41 which was typi-
cally brutal to both sides, as when he
wasn’t smashing the ball to all parts of
the leg side boundary he was watching
the ball whistle past his off stump. A
massive DFL maximum over long-on
was the highlight, closely followed by
an impressive argument with the Sus-
sex team about fielding restrictions.
Unfortunately, the journey to the sea-
side had wiped all notion of the pur-
pose of a cricket bat from the other
Imperial players and their serene pro-
gress was spectacularly halted when
Babla (with the second-highest score
of 10) and Payne both got out in the
space of two balls. Babla took a rash
swipe and skied the ball before Payne,
still angry at how Babla had given his
wicket away, lofted an easy catch to
mid-off; this triggered the mother of
all collapses where Imperial fell from
75-2 to 81 all out.
A dejected Imperial team made their
way back to London, where Andy
showed his prowess at driving the min-
ibus by stalling twice in two minutes,
which cheered up everyone no-end.
The team performance was excellent
given the available players and there
was an impressive improvement in
fielding from the match on the previ-
ous Sunday. If improvements are made
in the batting order and with more
players hitting the ball, IC 2nd XI will
be a force to be reckoned with.
