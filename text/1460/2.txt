DPE nominations open
You may have thought you’d finished
with elections after yesterday, but ac-
tually you have yet another chance to
exercise your democratic right and
guide the direction of Union life. Yes,
after the excitement of the Union sab-
batical elections, we have entered an-
other set, the aptly named ‘Summer
elections’. Nominations have opened
for nine official positions which will
involve their elected nominee in the
running of Union in a gamut of ways
for next year.
As well as four positions regularly
elected in the Summer elections, chairs
of RAG, CAG and the Council as well
as Equal Opportunities officer, nomi-
nations are open for three students to
inaugurate the brand spanking new
Ents Committee, which will convene
throughout the year to review and im-
prove Union Entertainment.
RAG and CAG chairs are respon-
sible for leading two of the Union’s
leading charitable societies, Raising
and Giving, which organises fundrais-
ing events throughout the year, and
Community Action Group, which or-
ganises charitable events and services
in London. The Council chair has
an important role in hosting Union
committee meetings which formulate
council policy. The Equal Opportuni-
ties Officer is responsible for promot-
ing equal opportunities within Impe-
rial by working closely with sabbatical
officers, particularly Deputy Presi-
dent (Welfare) the incumbent Vicki
Masding.
Nominations will also be re-opened
for one more Student trustee to stand
alongside the three elected last term,
and finally Deputy President (Edu-
cation) a paid, sabbatical position
which was left empty by Meera Gane-
shadevan’s recent resignation. This is

urope is at a crossroads. This is about no more and no less
than the future of Europe and about Germany’s future in
Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel pronounced on
Wednesday regarding the Greek financial crisis.
Merkel and the architects of the bailout package due to be put in place
next week are facing doubts from investors over whether the 110 billion
Euro bailout will work. Meanwhile, questions are being raised over the
consequences if the Greek government does not meet austerity measures
demanded as a condition of the loans. European leaders insist that the
loan package will be revoked if the agreed conditions are not met; how-
ever, the EU’s willingness to enforce such rules is unclear because no Euro
member has, to date, incurred penalties as should have happened under
the 1996 Stability Pact, an agreement that specifies rules and fines for
Euro member government spending. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the cri-
sis took a human toll on as rioters in Athens set fire to a bank building.
Three employees were killed.

leanup efforts progressed in the oil spill which has been re-
leasing 5,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico.
The safety record of Transocean, the Swiss-based firm con-
tracted by BP to drill has been brought into question: last year, the com-
pany’s board did not award bonuses to its executives because of safety
concerns. As the owner of the oil in question, BP stands to be liable
for what is estimated to be a $10 billion cleanup effort; its market capi-
talisation has dropped by over $30 billion in trading. The company has
procured one third of the world’s available dispersants and has already
deployed over 600,000 litres into the Gulf and on Wednesday announced
that it closed one of the three leak points, which is a significant milestone
but does not affect the rate of oil spillage. Komsomoloskaya Pravda,
Russia’s best-selling daily newspaper, published an article recommend-
ing that BP employ a Soviet-era tactic of closing the wells through the
detonation of atomic weapons. Significant concern has been raised by
environmentalists about the impact of the presence of oil and dispersants
on the ecosystem of the gulf.

uba has announced plans to lure more investment into its
tourism industry by allowing foreign firms to build attrac-
tions there.
The Cuban government generally doesn’t allow foreigners to own
property, but is willing to provide long term leases to firms will-
ing to build golf courses and other attractions. Cuba currently has
one golf course, but the government hopes to build ten more with
foreign investment. Previous attempts by the Cuban government
to raise funds through real estate sales in the 1990s led to lacklus-
ter results. At the same time of announcing the new real estate
plan, the Cuban government announced its worst sugar harvest in
a century.
