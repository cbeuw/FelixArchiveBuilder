Well done to last week’s winner Sh-
eryl. Make sure you get those answers
in as soon as you pick the paper up. To
be honest they needn’t even be correct,
it’s unlikely that I’d notice. Well, back
to revision.

Horo-mopes: Horoscopes but a hella broody too
It’s exam season, no one’s reading. Who cares anyway? F*ck this. I’ve only had seven coffees today. Woe me!
Cancer
Election fever dies
down, and the exams
loom. All excitement
in life has gone, and
even the elections
aren’t exciting.
You retreat to the library, and spend the next
few weeks subsisting off the library café’s
produce. Subsisting would imply nourishment
however. In fact you nearly die of a surfeit of
melted cheese. Or cheese fumes. It’s hard to tell.
Virgo
Your cat has
AIDS. It’s official.
Tinkerbell just didn’t
know how to break
it to you, so he left
a note on the kettle.
Tinkerbell’s no where to be seen, but the note
says that you should definitely get yourself
checked out. The scratches around your groin
are beginning to tell a different story to the
one you initially had in your head. Oh dear.
Gemini
Somone’s whispering in
your ear. You have no
idea who it is. It’s a fe-
male voice and it’s been
going on all day. You’re
trying to get on with
your day but the voice isn’t letting you. You turn
around wrap your shovel around whoever’s head is
making those noises. Turns out its your mum and
she’s asking you what you want for your birthday.
You ungrateful son of a bitch.
Pisces
You celebrate your
5th birthday as
your song ‘Baby’
hits #1 on every
bloody chart.
Unfortuntaely the
backwards Icelandic people think your corpse
will appease Eyjafjallajökull and the rest of the
world think you’re a fucking git. The cries you
let out as they remove your skin sound kind
of like the chorus to your hit single but better.
Leo
You rock up to the
library for your
millionth night in a
row to find the cafe
has run out of Juiced
Energy. You harrass the
bitch of cashier but she refuses to help; you skin
her alive, drain her of all fluids, make your own
energy drink and leave her corpse for the other
employees on Queen’s Lawn as a reminder to
fucking stock up on Relentless for fuck’s sake!
Aries
You discover the won-
der that is Imperial
Fitfinder and stumble
upon a description of
a girl that sounds just
like your mum. Un-
bearably aroused, you go to her alleged location
on 5th. Some minger is waiting with chloroform;
you awake to find she has cut off your right hand
and injected you with cat aids. Serves you right for
wasting your time on that website, you sad twat.
Scorpio
You’ve found yourself
asleep in the park. It’s
dark, wet and you have
no idea what time it is.
There’s some old timers
making noises behind
those trees. Maybe the world’s ended and they’re
survivors of the apocolypse too. You groggily head
over to see they need and help. Turns out you’re
on Hampstead Heath and they’re having their ‘mid-
night snack’
. Well, if in doubt.....
Libra
Libra, libra – oh, to be
free, and not chained
to this library desk,
revising. The chain’s
the least of your
problems, however –
you wait till you see what the librarian’s going to
do with that stamp. You naughty girl – all those
overdue books… Oh, three overdue notices.
What you gonna do about them with your
frumpy yet SEXY mullet.
Taurus
Because you’re an id-
iot, you skipped your
Business for Engi-
neers lectures. To try
and score some extra
marks on your exam
you seduce your lecturer. Sadly he is actually
the ugliest, fattest man ever (may actually be a
Vogon) and crushes your lungs whilst thrusting.
He finishes up and leaves your corpse in Prince’s
Gardens for the pigeons to fight over.
Capricorn
Celebrating after the
exams, you act like a
complete twat in the
Union, unleashing a
torrent of abuse on
the bar staff. You then order a Guinness, and feel
bad when you see they’ve drawn a shamrock in it,
bless. How do they do it?
You feel even worse when you see the barman
drying his knob off. Pint?
Aquarius
You meet a horrible
old lady who insists
that your views on
immigration are
wrong. She makes
you look silly so
you go home and cry to mummy. Whilst
unbuttoning your trousers mummy tells you
that the bigoted old woman was wrong; you
feel much better and put on your robe and
wizard hat.

Sagittarius
You hear that it’s much
easier to remember facts
if you make a story out
of them, and use this
to aid your revision. It
works. Unfortunately,
you’re a pervert, and murmuring your filth to
yourself in the exam, you get a giant erection,
which raises your table slightly. Your lecturer gives
you a knowing smile, calmly walks over to your
table and gives the two-knock-two-minute signal.
