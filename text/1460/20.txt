Metric
Our new nightclub Metric will inherit much of
it’s look and feel from the features we have
uncovered during the demolition process.
The club will feature a main section with a
warehouse feel. The floor and bar will be
polished concrete which is not only hard
wearing, but also provides an edgy, modern
urbanity feel. The walls and ceiling will have
exposed brick work and beams making the
most of the space we have available. The
main area also features booth seating which
faces towards the dancefloor and stage.
The dancefloor in Metric will be wooden to
distinguish the area from the rest of the club.
The stage will be raised with a permanent
DJ booth behind it. The DJ booth will be a
centrepiece of Metric complete with an LED
acrylic wall which can change colour and
design.
Since Metric needs to be an inviting venue
on non-club nights too, the bar also faces
onto a lounge area which has a lower ceiling
and more comfortable seating. This area is
intended to be more chilled out offering an
ideal area for a drink during the day or a break
from the bustle of the dancefloor.
The Bar/Cafe
The still-to-be-named bar and cafe will have
a very bright and fresh feel so that it serves
as an ideal destination to go for a drink or
meal.
The existing booth seating will be replaced
with more space-efficient booths that link
the walled seating with the rest of the room.
The room will feature exposed brickwork
behind the bar and polished wooden
flooring.
The bar itself will be considerably longer
than it currently is in da Vinci’s allowing for
faster service. Again, the bar will be made
of concrete and above the bar will also
be concrete. We hope to project onto the
concrete above the bar to show sports and
television programmes.
Behind the bar will be new offices for the bar
team as well as a new large cellar which will
service all the bars across the entire venue.
There will also be a new kitchen designed for
quicker service both at lunchtimes and in the
evenings.

The Bar/Cafe
As work continues in what was dB’s our architect has been working on the designs for the
new bar and Metric. These designs are based on the feedback from our working group as
well as from staff and sabbaticals.
We are really excited to show them to you now and get your feedback. These are the first of
many detailed designs that we will have over the coming months as building work ramps up
on both the nightclub and the bar.
