Sheryl submitted the first complete shading bit, but Matthew Colvin did the first proper
complete solution. So meah. Points all round. You won’t catch me being this nice again!
Well done on the massive number of entries for this puzzle last week- it has to be exam time.

How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.

Ok. So the real answer was three
women, but incest needed to be allowed
for that to happen. I overruled the
Puzzles Commodore, and sent him to
get his head looked at. So answers of
five were accepted.
Below is the answer from Martin
Hague.
‘Look, I am an artist, I drew a pretty
family tree! Horizontal lines are
sisters, vertical mother - daughters; so
1 is 5’s great-great-aunt, 2 is 5’s great-
grandmother, 4 is 5’s grandmother, 5 is
3’s grandniece, 1 is 4’s aunt, 1 and 2 are
sisters, so are 3 and 4, 3 is 2’s daughter,
and so is 4, and that should be all boxes
ticked - with five girls.’

Bridges 1,460
How to play:
Connect all the
‘islands’ together
by bridges
running in direct
lines, North,
West, East and
South only, with
no more than
two bridges
connecting any
two distinct
islands. Every
island must have
a total number
of bridges from
it equal to the
number on
the island and
bridges must not
cross islands,
one another or
lead to nowhere!

Well done to team GLT another win for this puzzle
last week.
This puzzle seems to be one you like with lots of
entries this week, but please keep them coming,
remember those iPods we promised. Well we may
start thinking about them soon. Possibly.
Anyways, the deal is you keep on sending shit in
and we keep on making up more nice new puzzles
for you. That’s a dealbreaker.

Saw you fighting outside
the union last friday. It
made me wet to see your
chinese muscles ripple
in the moonlight and the
beads of sweat drip from
your forehead. Can you
take me home and throw
me about like that bloke
was doing with you paper?
Don’t worry I’m not as
loose as the pages. I also
like a bit of rough S&M”
