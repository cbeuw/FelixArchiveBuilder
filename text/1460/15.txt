The events in Agora take place in 391
A.D. as the sun starts to set on the
Roman Empire. Christianity is gain-
ing more and more power from the
public and the number of believers is
growing exponentially every day. This
means trouble for the pagans and the
atheists. As the Christians are growing
in momentum and power, their hatred
towards other religions also grows. It
appears the city of Alexandria will not
be a safe place unless the place is domi-
nated by a single religion.
All of this sounds incredibly religion-
heavy – a major downer. But fear not,
for Agora is not just about the religious
conflicts. Director Amenábar amaz-
ingly manages to include astronomy,
philosophy, geometry, mathematics
and romance in the midst of the city’s
turmoil. The film’s protagonist, Hypa-
tia (Rachel Weisz), is an atheist phi-
losopher and teacher who is forever
fascinated by and is trying to figure out
how Earth fits into the solar system.
She has some rough ideas, but nothing
is definite for sure. She has love inter-
ests, Orestes (Oscar Isaac), her student
and Davus (Max Minghella), her slave,
but she is far too busy to address them.
She does notice them but her love to-
wards them is strictly platonic: a true

philosopher, she is focused solely on
her research and her academia.
The hefty number of Goyas (Span-
ish equivalent of the Oscars) won by
the technical departments of the film
goes to show that one of the biggest
accomplishments of Agora lies in the
special effects, cinematography, cos-
tume, make-up, and production de-
sign crews. They have all been justly
awarded and it’s easy to marvel at the
endless technical achievements. Agora
immediately turns into a visual treat,
with the flawless, epic recreation of Al-
exandria, recapturing the city in all its
glory initially, but later, in its decline.
The details are hard to ignore and the
grandness of it all is a dazzling view.
Crucial events occur in the biggest
places, the library of Alexandria, the
town square etc, and they are sights to
behold. The sacking of the Alexandria
library carried out by the Christians
who drive out the pagans from the
library is handled with perfectly con-
trolled pace. There is enough speed to
build up plenty of tension and a strong
sense of urgency but it’s never rushed
past, the camera does linger in certain
places to give the audience the maxi-
mum amount of detailed, vivid drama,
and a chance for the excellent musical
score to thrive.
Amenábar is a big fan of using aerial
shots and he uses them in all the right
moments. And with these shots, he
can show the spectacularly rebuilt city
of Alexandria in one big sweep, as well
as the large crowds of people flowing
in and out of the city that closely re-
semble little bugs swarming the place,
which is a truly exhilarating visual ex-
perience. The struggles surrounding

Emerging from Liverpool after the
city’s stint as European Capital of Cul-
ture, Kicks is a dark slow drama delv-
ing into the world of celebrity obses-
sion. And I mean slow, the snailpace of
this film drags out its bare plot to the
point of exasperation.
Nichola Burley, last seen viciously
seeking revenge in Donkey Punch,
slips easily into the role of Jasmine,
desperate to fulfil her dream of mar-
rying a footballer and getting her ‘tits’
done. After meeting Nicole (newcom-
er Kerrie Hayes), the two girls bond
over their love for Liverpool United
superstar Lee Cassidy (Jamie Doyle).
Cue endless shots of the mottled con-
crete that infests Merseyside as the
girls stalk their idol at his home and
club.
Lee is deliberately played with all
the arrogant unpleasantness you’d
expect of a Premiereship footballer
who finds himself on the wrong side
of the girls affections, when a transfer
to Madrid is approved. At the heart of
the film lies the relationship between
the girls, whose worship of the celeb-
rity footballer arises due to broken
families. The shy Nicole is portrayed
rather brilliantly by Hayes, whose del-
icate innocence is caused by the ab-
sence of her parents whereas Jasmine
is showered with money and clothes
but finds comfort with Nicole that her
crass parents can never offer.
Unfortunately the performances are
let down by the story which never re-
ally amounts to anything. It is at times
painful to watch the plot meander to-
wards the predictable climax which is
where the film breaks down, the writ-
ers apparently not sure what to do.
The soundtrack is provided by the
Scouse electro pop outfit Ladytron
which makes up for some of the origi-
nality lacking in the film. Kicks has it’s
faults but it has many strong points
too, especially in the rising stars of
Nichola Burley and Kerrie Hayes. Es-
sentially it’s a flawed fable about the
dangers of celebrity culture.
the different religions are given the ex-
tra dramatic push with the wonderful
camerawork and music. Massacres are
never easy to watch but they’re even
more disturbing to watch when they
happen repeatedly; Amenába doesn’t
go overboard though, so they never
get boring.
The action is handled well by much
technical flourish, but the rest is up
to the actors. Weisz is on fine form as
usual as the intelligent, independent
woman who craves knowledge more
than anything else in the world. She
is an atheist, and this does inevitably
land her into trouble, but she is not
a weak-spirited person. She is head-
strong and brave, qualities Weisz por-
trays beautifully. Minghella, the slave,
therefore creating the forbidden love
subplot, is also hugely effective. The
frustration and confusion his char-
acter experiences as he finds himself
torn between religion and his eternal
love for a woman he never will be
able to have for himself are well es-
tablished by the young actor’s
exceptional performance.
He doesn’t have a lot
of dialogue and relies
on his body move-
ments to do the
acting, a method
that pays off im-
mensely due to his
talent. Yet another
stand-out here is
Isaac, playing the
character that com-
pletes the love trian-
gle. He’s a slimy, arro-
gant student to start with
but his character changes: his af-
fection towards Hypatia remains but
as he gets older he turns into a man of
slightly more insight and intelligence,
a change that is convincingly showed
throughout by Isaac.
Agora is a stirring, epic journey that
takes us to unique places and explores
fascinating characters who get caught
up in extraordinary events. It certain-
ly is a welcome return from the always
masterful Amenábar who can bring
out all sorts of heart-
wrenching emo-
tions with the

The explosive trailer for Machete has just gone up on
the internet. A bit ironic when you consider that the
film is based on a fake trailer itself. Oh well, feast your
eyes on this impressive cast - Dany Trejo, Michelle
Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal
and Robert de Niro! Robert Rodriguez has promised
this film is going to be pure Mexploitation. Watch the
trailer now at http://bit.ly/bfBG0n
