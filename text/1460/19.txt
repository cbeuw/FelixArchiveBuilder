How do each of you contribute to
each song you make? And how do
you tell the other if they have a rub-
bish idea that you don’t want to use?
Or do you politely accept it and cry
yourselves to sleep?
We say it very directly. “C’est de la
merde”. But I think we need to find
another technique, because when Ben
says that to me I can disappear from
the studio for two or three days to be
angry on my own like a kid, thinking
that I’m a genius and how much I don’t
need him... But I’m always back, and...
hmm... yes it was shit!
How important are the visual as-
pects (artwork, videos, or even the
way you present yourselves)? Do
you see the whole thing as one or are
they all vehicles to carry your music?
I think it’s a whole project. I am very
bored with Graphic design, and graph-
ic designers (I think 90% of the hipsters
think they are graphic designers). We
prefer photography, something sim-
ple. Not too many colours. That’s why
we worked with Gavin Watsons (He
did the famous picture books called
“Skins” and “Rave 89”)
You’ve done a lot of remixes for oth-
er bands, is it simply a case of trans-
French band the Shoes on remixes and casual racism
forming a song into an alternative
version when you do this? Do you
put a “The Shoes” twist on it, or per-
haps polish it into a version of what
you think it should sound like?
We love doing remixes. It a funny
game. We only keep Vocals. Always.
Because it’s really cool to create a new
harmony with the vocal line. With the
same vocals melody you can create
so many different atmospheres. Our
favourite remixes are the “pop” ones.
Not club. We love to do something soft
and very pop. Unexpected. For exam-
ple, check our remix of Telepathe or
our remix of Adam Kesher. Sometimes
we’re a bit bored with dance remixes.
We never dance by the way.

If you’re staying in
London over the
Summer or you’re
just visiting for
a few days, keep
things simple by
staying with us.
We’ve got rooms
available in
Wilson House,
Paddington and
Fisher Hall, South
Kensington, which
are both ideal for
getting around
London.
This was a full length picture but we don’t have space for it. bet you’re
wondering what their shoes are like, aren’t you?
And how do you feel when other
people have re-worked your songs,
does it take a while to get used to
the fact that they have completely
messed with it?
It’s always the same. At the first lis-
ten, we always hate it! It’s always very
strange. And we listen to it again and
again. And sometimes it’s very good,
even better than the original. For our
next EP we did a song with Esser called
“Stay The Same”, we’ve got a lot of
great remixes! From Etienne de Crecy,
IsolŽe, Harvard Bass and Siriusmo.
Classy remixers, we are very proud.
You’re taking part in the Oui Love
Exchange Tour which will make peo-
ple more aware of some of the latest
French acts. Apart from Daft Punk
and Air, what other artists would
you recommend in order to rid our
ignorance of French music? Why do
you think that there is such a lack of
French musicians in the mainstream
charts in the UK?
Because you’re Racist! Hahaha, seri-
ously, I think (I hope) that it’s chang-
ing step by step. Before, the famous
French artists were only in electronic
music, like Daft Punk. But since the
success of Phoenix, we’ve begun to
be good at pop music and rock’n’roll.
The Shoes are playing in
London at the Mac Beth
on the 14th of May, get
your shoes on and go see
them!
And there are a lot of good bands right
now. If before the French weren’t in the
UK it was because they were not good
enough I guess.
As an artist, what do you think
makes a good gig? How do you
try to distinguish yourselves from
other bands in the live scene in or-
der to make sure that the audience
walk away knowing they have had a
unique “The Shoes” experience?
The Oui Love tour will be the first time
we’ll play our new live show. Before, we
were in a kind of “electronic DJ” per-
formance. A dance music act. Now we
want to show what our record is. So we
play a lot of crazy keyboard, we sing,
there are even soft songs. It’s gonna be
the “pop” side of The Shoes. The side
we prefer at the moment.
So we are very excited!
