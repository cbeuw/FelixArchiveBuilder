id you know that hip-
hop was invented in
Feudal Japan? No? Well
neither did I until I
watched Tajomaru, a
2009 Japanese movie about an out-
lawed Royal who leaves his kingdom
to become a badass with an over-
sized sword. Besides being a decent
hack’n’slash 16th Century Japanese
epic, there was one scene which com-
pletely destroyed the po-faced tone of
the movie: when the exiled swords-
man meets a group of bandits pillag-
ing a village, they stop and present
themselves and their wonderful lives
of rape and murder in rap format,
complete with breakdancing and all.
It’s a hilarious moment which seems
weird at first but is actually quite fit-
ting in the context.
This got me thinking about how in-
tertwined hip-hop and oriental culture
have become over the years. These
two seemingly opposing worlds have
collided in numerous media formats
leading me to the conclusion that there
must be some sort of link between the
two.
Indeed, since starting out in 1992,
the Wu-Tang Clan – arguably the
greatest hip-hop crew ever – have
based their entire mythology and lyri-
cal content on Chinese culture, Tao-
Virus Syndicate ally the murky beats
of dubstep, courtesy of DJ MRK1,
with the grime vocals of emcees
Goldfinger, JSD and Nika D. But
this ain’t Kode9 & Spaceape. The
tracks here have lost the grittiness of
both aforementioned genres by be-
ing completely overproduced. They
differ from the growing number of
generic dubstep “tunes” by the vo-
cals, but these range from menacing
(Anything) to comedic (Crazy) to
melodramatic and plain laughable
(Believe). The only genuine tune is
Talk to Frank, an ode to the drugs
industry with a genius chorus. In the
end, though, they’re just flogging a
stillborn horse with “pop-step’ writ-
ten all over it.

Hip-hop and oriental philosophy...?
If you’re lucky enough not to be revis-
ing (and you must be if you’re read-
ing this) how about heading down to
Brighton for a weekend festival this
month? Over 350 bands are playing at
various clubs and venues around the
town and if it’s sunny you might even
enjoy the beaches too.
The Great Escape
Where do I even begin? If you’re fond of
sand dunes and salty air there’s Groove
Armada, punk-reggae legends The
Slits, indie cool kids like The Big Pink
and Wild Beasts. Here’s a very short-
ened list: The Sunshine Underground,
Crystal Fighters, Chase & Status, Tinie
Tempah, Broken Social Scene, Japan-
droids, I Blame Coco, These New Puri-
tans, The Walkmen, Cornershop, Slow
Club, Tuung, Ellie Goulding, Marina &

Motorpsycho are an institution in their
native Norway, described as “one of
music’s best kept secrets”. This state-
ment does not seem far-fetched upon
listening to their fourteenth full-length
album (and 50th-something release
counting EPs and live albums since the
band’s inception in 1989) Heavy Metal
Fruit.
Equal parts prog-rock, psychedelic
jams and stoner-metal, Motorpsycho
produce songs fusing the raw heavi-
ness and dynamic range of Kyuss with
the structural complexity of Tool,
throwing in some incredible jazz licks
and rock n’ roll riffs. Six tracks of glori-
ous sing-a-long vocals and far-out lyr-
ics make for an exhilarating and trippy
hour-long space odyssey.

The Breakout Trilogy
ism and kung-fu movies adapted to
their experiences of life on the streets
of New York City. They incorporate
comic book imagery of kung fu fight-
ing into the hardships of being gangsta,
mixing Chinese words with their own
slang (for example they refer to their
native Staten Island as “Shaolin”). The
Clan’s spiritual leader and producer
RZA has written two philosophical
books titled “The Wu-Tang Manual”
and “The Tao of Wu” which describe
in depth the beliefs and founding prin-
ciples of the group.
This is where the link is: self-pro-
claimed “gangstas” may rap about mur-
der, prison, misogyny and arson but
they all stick to a certain code among
their individual circles. Honour thine
Homie, rob from the rich and give to
the poor, live by the sword and die by
the sword and so on. There is a certain
morality to their lyrics which can only
be related back to things like the Bush-
ido, the Samurai code by which retain-
ers were taught to obey and defend
their feudal lord above all else. These
warriors were ready to sacrifice their
lives in the name of a cause which may
seem ridiculous in our day and age, but
back then meant everything. It is all
about honour, much like rap battles are
all about coming out victorious having
crushed your enemy on the lyrical bat-
tlefield. In Kobayashi’s 1962 classic Ha-
rakiri the hero defeats an entire band
of samurai and proceeds to cut their
topknots off, the sign of their samurai
status, knowing they will have to kill
themselves because of the disgrace of
this loss. In the same way one deci-
sive verbal jab about how overweight
an opponent’s mother is results in his
utter humiliation, loss of honour and
subsequent stutter of death.
These analogies are best exempli-
fied in Jim Jarmusch’s incredible Ghost
Dog: Way of The Samurai, the story of
a ghetto hit man who lives by the codes
of the Hagakure, an 18th-century Japa-
nese warrior text. The soundtrack is
hip-hop in all its glory (scored by the
RZA) and Forest Whitaker is spot-on
as the gangster-turned-modern samu-
rai who carries the film to its final
massacre. Another tribute to kung fu
movies and Japanese anime was Taran-
tino’s Kill Bill, again scored by the RZA
and featuring some tasty beats over a
blood-splattered bride killing every-
one in her way. These Western movies
both associate tales of revenge carried
out by honour-bound warriors with a
hip-hop soundtrack.
It would seem that it is also a two-
way street then, since hip-hop is now
becoming a typical soundtrack for
samurai warriors to bop their heads to
as they slice and dice. Shinichiro Wa-
tanabe’s anime series Samurai Cham-
ploo which aired in Japan in
2005 frequently inserted
elements of hip hop culture
in every episode; rap, break
dancing, turntablism, hip
hop slang, and graffiti are
aplenty. The crossover is
complete.
The ultimate fusion of both
cultures arrived in 2007
when Takashi Okazaki’s
love of hip-hop music
and American media
were combined in his
avant-garde manga Afro
Samurai, featuring an
African-American samurai
who travels the land kill-
ing hundreds of enemies in
a quest to avenge his father’s
death. This was later adapted
into an award-winning anime se-
ries scored by (you guessed it) the
RZA and voiced by Samuel L. Jack-
son. It is now being developed as a
Hollywood movie, which just goes
to show how the two seemingly
opposite worlds have become
almost synonymous in some
people’s minds. And with
good reason: they’re both
hella badass.

Hush...! Don’t tell everyone but
there’s a show combining all sorts of
fun happenings a mere stone’s throw
from Imperial at the Royal Albert
Hall. Hush combines indie-folk and
classical music, beatboxing, stand-
up comedy and flamenco dancing.
What’s not to like? It’s a night of
folky bliss and enchantment. It’s al-
ways good to see bands playing out
here in often music-barren South
London, so you don’t have to trek
half way down Oxford Street or all the
way to Shoreditch. On top of that, it’s
only £7.50!
Hush - 12th May
Headlining is the indie-folk fantastic
Peggy Sue, one of Kadhim’s favourite
artists. Joining them is pop singer-
songwriter Anna Calvi and the earthy
orchestral rock of Canada’s the Rural
Alberta Advantage.

Who:
Elgar Room @ The Royal Albert Hall
