‘re-mployment’iswhenapreviously
used mployment is repeated and
is generally bad as it didn’t win
the party enough votes the first
time and/or the other parties are
aware of those strategies that were
used in previous elections. For this
reason the parties hire individuals
to de-remployment their campaign
strategy. Other parties will in turn
attempt to reverse those efforts and
this is the ‘un-de-re-mployment’
problem that every party has to
address. It’s a bit like tennis.

S
o, we’ve a fighter on our hands.
If any of you’ve ever had the
pleasure of meeting our ‘fewix
editorr’ Dan Wan, you wouldn’t
think of him as a fighter. Well, my
friends, he is. He managed to get into
a brawl last friday over this paper. Hats
off for sticking up for all this hard work
that someone was throwing about the
place; plus, the guy was massive. Even
comparing it to David and Goliath
would be a favourable comparison for
Wan. On the other hand, the Union
‘s already a Deputy President (Educa-
tion) short for next year, and if Dan
keeps on trying to start fights that he’s
always going to lose we’re going to be a
felix Editor short too!
So the next time you come to the of-
fice to complain about a spelling error,
keep a stiff eye on Dan as he’s more
likely than not to, upon his own voli-
tion, belt you. Enough of him.
My week has been a little different to
normal, been in quite high spirits to be
honest. However, last Monday morn-
ing I was coming in to College on my
motorbike for an early morning revi-
sion session. Being a bank holiday, sun-
ny and about 8.30am I was gunning it,
Valentino Rossi stylie. This was to be
the main downfall, as Rossi has a bike
designed to be ridden fast. Me, not so
much. Coming up to my favourite turn
I decide to nail it. First mistake. The
foot peg dug into the road, lifted up the
back wheel and spat me down the road.
Using all my sense, I decided to hang
onto the bike to stop it getting too
damaged. However all I really succeed-
ed in doing was damaging myself more
as I slid down the road, face down, still
holding the handlebars. At this point
I was pretty sure I looked spectacular.
Once the bike (with me still attached)
came to a halt, I picked it up, forget-
ting to pull the clutch in. Second mis-
take. The bike lurched forward, and
I, right in front of my newly founded
stunt fan club, once again preceded to
fall over with the bike on top of me. At
this point I was just embarrassed. It’s
one thing to practise a fast dismount,
because it can be useful in situations
where you are being chased by a gang
of hoodies, maybe. But falling over like
a toddler who’s just learning to walk is
more embarrassing that watching Dan
Wan fight. [Ed - events described are
only half-true...]
Wordpath 1,460
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WORDS -> SWORD
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 5 letter
word from any 6+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. WORDS-> CROSS (via CROSSWORDS)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS (by LS) -> WARES (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

Again, last week’s
winner was Team
Dirty Medics. Please
can we stop those
horrible scummy
c-nuts beating us.
Come on guys do it
for yourselves at least.
Yesterday the country and I voted for
our favourite party. They all want to
hold their party at the same venue at
the same time so they ask us to vote
for them based on how many balloons
and the size of the cake they promise.
They are almost always lying and it will
be another five years before we get the
option to attend a different party!
So now the stress of it is all over, here
is an explanation of an overused term
from the election period, the so-called
‘underemployment’ all the parties
are combating (do not mistake with
unemployment, this is worse because a
party is at stake, and cake is involved).
UNDEREMPLOYMENT (adj.)
The root of this word is ploy,
meaning a maneuver or trick made
to gain advantage in a situation.
Political parties often use multiple
ploys in each election i.e. an
m-ploy election strategy. A political
party using this strategy is said to
be in a state of ‘mployment’.
Arrow Maze 1,460
How to play:
Fill all the squares with numbers to form a path from 1 to 49, such that the arrow
under each number points to the square containing the number one greater
(except for 49 obviously, which has no arrow, being the end of the path).
Hints:
26 is pointed to by three arrows but only one of them is pointing only at 26, so
this square must be 25. The square immediately right of 4 is only pointing to one
square so can temporarily be labelled ‘A’ and the square it’s pointing to can be
labelled ‘A+1’. Now we no longer consider ‘A+1’ as a destination for other arrows.
T
ehnical term meaning:
‘word origin/ history’.
