This week you decide to stop
drinking – less embarrass-
ment, less expense, no hango-
vers – a win-win situation. You
realise that you’re a horribly dull
person and are incapable of
holding a conversation without
the lubrication of alcohol. You
might be sober, but you don’t
have any friends any more…
Look, even your liver is lonely…
This week you go to a house
party and won’t stop asking
the DJ to play a totally hot new
underground tech house track
you found on Soundcloud to
look cooler. They reluctantly
play it to humour you but you
get so into your techno two-
step you trip over and show
everyone your floral M&S gran-
ny knickers. You look cool now.
This week your new year’s
resolution is to finish your
coursework more than 10
minutes before the deadline
for once. With 11 minutes to
go, you smugly push it into
the box, but you get so excit-
ed about handing it in early
that you cum through the slot
and ruin yours and everyone
else’s coursework.
This week you venture to the
gym in a desperate bid to get
fit. You turn up intending to
break yourself in gently with
15 mins on the treadmill but
the receptionist advises you
try a free circuits class. You
give it a try – how bad can it
be? Half way through though,
you collapse and die of ex-
haustion. Pint?
This week, you decide to
go on a tomato diet. You eat
20 tomatoes a day: nothing
more, nothing less. After a
few days you cut yourself and
tomato juice leaks out of the
wound. You feverishly lick it
up and notice your skin is red
too. You gulp down your own
tomatoey flesh until only your
eyeballs are left - so tasty.
This week you decide to inac-
tivate your Facebook account
in a bid to be more productive.
You are so reclusive that eve-
ryone assumes this means you
have died. Your friends sell all
your clothes, your old Game-
boy and even your fleshlight.
Your textbooks are the only
friends you have now… isn’t
this what you wanted?
This week you decide get
more sunlight as the many
hours spent revising in the Li-
brary have given you rickets.
Upon venturing outside you
are so unused to the sun that
you are immediately blinded
and turn to stone. Your statue
is left as a warning to anyone
who ever tries to leave the Li-
brary before 11pm.
This week you decide you re-
ally have to get a girlfriend.
As the ratio at Imperial is not
in your favour, you try online
dating. You create a profile
but are so ugly and socially
awkward that no one replies
to your messages. The rings
of Saturn indicate that maybe
your destiny is to die a virgin:
accept your fate.
This week you decide to try
and get to all your lectures on
time. But instead of getting up
5 minutes earlier you decide
to just cycle faster. You trium-
phantly arrive at College in
time but have such a sweaty
bum that it looks like you are
trailing a stream of wee. You
are so mortified you miss all
your lectures anyway.
This week you fall down a
drain and become trapped
there. You try to befriend the
rats but they are not fooled
by your attempts to grow a
tail. Before long you catch
the plague; as you lie shak-
ing in a sewer they begin to
close in and nibble at your
fingers. You cannot deny
them fresh meat…
This week you are so fat that
you begin to lose things in
your folds of flesh. You lift up
one of the folds in the hope
you might have stored your
problem sheet there, but the
cheesy congealed sweaty
rotting skin smell that greets
you knocks you out and you
fall into a coma. Pint (when
you’ve woken up)?
This week, you must choose be-
tween having daggers for finger-
nails or 3kg iron nipples. You’d
neverhavetoworryaboutwalking
home alone with the dagger nails
but self-injury would be a grave
risk. The nipples could be hidden
by baggy jumpers, getting naked
would be weird and you could
never go swimming in public
again.What’sitgoingtobe?

TWATOFTHEWEEK
Airing your dirty laundry in public. What would your mother say? Wait, she’s right
here. She says don’t come home again, ever. Don’t believe me. It’s on film, you’ll just
have to fast forward through some of the more dodgy stuff to see it.
