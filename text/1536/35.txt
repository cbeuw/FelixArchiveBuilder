Slitherlink
2. Can you see a pattern?
To solve a Slitherlink puzzle is easy: you
need to draw a single closed loop by joining
the dots (not diagonally!) so that the num-
bered squares are surrounded by the corre-
sponding number of lines.
The numbers show you how
many groups of black squares
are in a row or column, as well
as how many black squares
each group consists of. Filling
in the grid produces a pretty
picture.

Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to
any other one. There
are restrictions,
though: the bridges
have to be either
vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You
can have up to two
bridges between any
two islands and, last
but not least, each
island must have ex-
actly as many bridg-
es stemming from it
as the number on it.
Fill the cells with a
continuous line (the
“snake”) that does
not pass through a
cell twice, doesn’t
intersect with itself,
and passes through
all white boxes. The
numbers show you
how many times the
snake turns in the
corresponding row
or column. The snake
enters and exits the
grid at the shown
points (and only
those points). There
are some hints to get
you started.

Say goodbye to FUCWIT, and say
hello to FUCWIT 2: Electric Boo-
galoo. As promised, FUCWIT has
reset and now is your chance to
see yourself at the top of the lead-
erboard, so send your answers to
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
As a reminder of how points
work, it’s 1 point per correct so-
lution, plus 1 point if you’re the
first one to send it (with double
points for the cryptic crossword
when we have one, because I hear
it’s a pain to crack).
