Study claims LOLCATs cause climate change

A
landmark new study
published next month
claims to have discov-
ered an inextricable
link between the recent
proliferation of LOLCATs and the
rise in the mean global temperature.
he conservative, libertarian and
wholly unbiased think-tank (ahem)
he Heartland Institute swear they’ve
found a compelling correlation be-
tween the explosion of cute kitten
pictures accompanied by short hu-
morous phrases on the internet, and
the rise in mean global temperature.
his came in an announcement made
late Wednesday.
A section of the statement reads:
“We still don’t quite know how the
crafty LOLCATs are doing it, but
there’s no arguing with a Spear-
man’s Rank Correlation Coeﬃcient
of 0.894±0.05. he real take home
message here is that the everyman
no longer needs to install hippy so-
lar panels or buy a communist wagon
[electric car]. A UN lead initiative to
instigate felinicide worldwide by 2020
is enough to avert the dreaded 2.0ºC
global temperature rise and ensure
a stable climate planet wide for the
foreseeable future. hey aren’t even
that cute. he one with the cheese-
burger just looks stupid.”
Internet groups have responded
with a measure of courtesy propor-
tional to the scientiﬁc rigour dem-
onstrated by the study. At the time of
going to print, he Heartland Insti-
tute was still in ﬂames. he local au-
thorities suspect arson, but agree that
a smouldering wreck is probably best
for the advancement of humankind
all round.
One of the more literate and sweary
bloggers who contests Heartland’s
ﬁndings wrote that “the study does
not provide any testable predictions
for how LOLCATs could actually af-
fect the climate... anyway rule zero of
the internet says don’t fuck with cats
so shut the fuck up”.
he Heartland Institute boasts an
impressive history of painfully biased
researching, claiming for a while that
second hand smoking isn’t all that bad
for you and “contributes to social dis-
course as an excellent conversation
starter” while insisting throughout
the noughties that the planet wasn’t
heating up at all and that most peer
reviewed science to the contrary was
“frequently conducted too close to ra-
diators, thus skewing the results”.
In spite of this troubled past, the
scientiﬁc community has seen ﬁt
to welcome the new research with
open arms. One scientist we spoke to
phrased it thus:
“Yeah they fucked about a bit with
all that denialist crap for a while, but
it’s like your mate from school who
smoked too much dope, dropped out
and is only now on the straight and
narrow doing a BTEC in Horticul-
ture or some shit. Sure it’s no Maths
degree, but we’ve all agreed to be re-
ally nice while they ﬁnd their feet. I’ve
never seen the appeal of LOLCATs
One of the offending
Lolcats, in a more
reflective mood
anyway. hey aren’t even that cute.
he one with the cheeseburger just
looks stupid.”
Regardless of their stance on this
divisive theory, scientists continue to
advise that even though it’s currently
fucking chilly, that’s just January and
the planet is actually getting quite
hot. It’s all too easy to fein confusing
Poll: Americans Think World Would be
Safer With More Nuclear Weapons
A
fter watching Alex
Jones wave statistics
in the face of Piers
Morgan on CNN last
week the majority of
United States citizens are petrified
by the fact that not all countries
have nuclear weapons.
American Carl Noles, leader
of the recently put together Arm
The World organisation, has said
“Think of all the war and violence
which would not have happened
if every country in the world were
in possession of nuclear weapons.
Would the atrocities of Vietnam
have happened... No. Would there
still be trouble between Israel and
Palestine... No. Would we have in-
vaded Iraq knowing they were in
custody of nuclear weapons... Al-
most certainly not.”
On his own show Piers Morgan
argued that the UK’s 35 gun mur-
ders last year could be seen in some
way as preferable to the US’s 11,458.
Jones’ agreed but quick as a flash
pulled up a London Telegraph
headline which read “UK – The
violent crime capital of Europe”
saying the british people, without
guns to protect themselves, were
subject to “hoards of people burn-
ing down cities and beating old
women’s brains out everyday.”
So although we may have a slight
increase in nuclear warfare the de-
cline in non-nuclear warfare should
be substantial, being almost elimi-
nated. Plus nuclear winter means
snow days, and so most students
are supportive.
A cost-benefit analysis that
weighs up for most Americans.
Iran’s president Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad has said it is a “wonder-
ful idea” adding “I can’t believe I
didn’t think of it myself.”
Tyrannical Syrian president
Bashar al-Assad would also sup-
port repealing the UN’s Treaty on
Nuclear Weapons saying “Not only
would this be wonderful for global
diplomatic relations but it could
have tremendous domestic impacts
too.”
The idea is gaining momentum in
the wider international community
after Piers Morgan vehemently op-
posed it.
local variations in weather with the
overall trend in global warming to
make faux-witty comments to your
mates about how shit climate science
is. hey’ve politely asked you to stop.
You aren’t funny and your grandkids
are going to wonder what the fuck you
were laughing at when their houses
get ﬂooded.
