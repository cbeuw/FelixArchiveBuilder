Le Misérable
A story of tax increases, strong words, national identity and Russian passports. Not up for nominations at the Oscars
“GéGé” is the aﬀectionate nickname
of famous French actor Gérard
Depardieu; but lately he hasn’t been
the recipient of much aﬀection.
Instead, Depardieu has found himself
at the centre of a debate that has
taken place in countless nations since
the ﬁnancial crisis began; how great
should the tax burden be, and how
should it be shared? In practice, the
question is narrowed down further,
so that the narrative focuses on the
highest earners in society and the
disparity of the “1%” versus the 99.
In France, current centre-left
President Francois Hollande brought
the debate into the political sphere
during his election campaign; his
Parti Socialiste ran on a platform of
equally split budget cuts, tax cuts and
tax rises that included a so called 75%
“Super Tax” on individuals earning
over €1m. hough largely taken as
a symbolic gesture for its expected
revenue of €200m, the tax made
Hollande’s political stance resolutely
clear, but immediately attracted
controversy.
he 75% rate constitutes the highest
income tax of any nation in the world,
followed up by Sweden’s 57% upper
limit. Despite an overwhelming
public support of 60%, however, many
business groups accuse Hollande
of driving away entrepreneurs and
threatening the French recovery; if
these arguments sound familiar, it’s
because they’re almost identical to the
debate over the 50% tax instigated at
the end of the last Labour government,
and now cut to 45% by the Coalition.
Shortly after Hollande’s
announcement, many prominent
wealthy citizens such as Jean Michel
Jarre, Brigitte Bardot, and CEO of the
luxury LVMH group Bernard Arnault
admitted to considering or even
taking steps towards expatriating.
And, of course, Depardieu.
Why, then, does Gérard’s case make
the headlines, even here in the United
Kingdom? Because it has far greater
symbolism than any of the others;
Dépardieu was born the son of a poor
metal worker, and left school at age 15;
given his own upbringing, shouldn’t
the issue of taxation and provision of
public services be close to his heart?
hus, when it emerged Dépardieu
had purchased a mansion in the
Belgian village of Néchin, it provoked
outrage; Néchin is notorious for
its community of wealthy French
“frontalières”, who proﬁt from the
region’s lower taxation.
France’s Prime Minister, Jean-
Jacques Ayrault, weighed in, declaring
Dépardieu’s actions “pathetic”, and
culture minister Audrey Filippetti
accused the actor of “deserting the
battleﬁeld” in the country’s war
against economic crisis. he story
then took an amazingly bizarre turn,
with Dépardieu writing an open
letter to the Prime Minister declaring
that he was “returning his passport”,
and accepting an oﬀer of Russian
citizenship from Vladimir Putin
himself.
hough for the moment it seems
the story is on pause; the 75% tax
is presently unworkable as it was
rejected by the French constitutional
courts on a technicality. However, the
analysis of Dépardieu’s letter rumbles
on. In it, he rejects accusations of
shirking responsibility, claiming
to have paid €145M in tax over his
lifetime, and that he paid a total of 85%
tax on his income last year. It seems
that, in arriving at this 85% ﬁgure,
Dépardieu is taking into account all
the charges levied on incomes from
his various business interests and
the 75% rate; that this hasn’t yet been
imposed, and indeed ignores other
vast contributions to his fortune such
as the recent sale of his Parisian hotel.
As Hollande has sworn to rework
and pursue his 75% tax rate, the
debate over tax in France looks set
to continue, and indeed similar ﬁghts
are playing out the world over. From
America’s ﬁscal cliﬀ negotiations to
Britain’s recent debate over welfare
reform, the crisis is forcing many
nations to reassess the conditions
that prevailed in the years of boom
and lax regulation, and the political
establishment will have to grind away
at this issue for years to come.
France steps up intervention in Mali
Alexander Soloviev Writer
Mali is in the middle of a crisis.
Since the start of 2012, a war of
independence has been fought
in its northern provinces, known
collectively as Azawad. he conﬂict
ended abruptly in April with the
ousting of the then President Amadou
Toumani Touré, by rebelling soldiers
over his handling of the war. he
loose alliance of Tuaregs and Islamists
(Ansar Dine, a group linked to Al-
Qaeda) then declared Azawad an
independent state.
he short war led to a dire
humanitarian crisis: some 200,000
people are currently displaced, with
millions more expected to be aﬀected
by drought. Amnesty International,
a human rights group, reported
instances of gang rape, executions
without trial and the use of child
soldiers in Azawad.
Besides the human suﬀering,
cultural casualties are also amassing:
Islamists seem to be keen on wiping
out the UNESCO-recognized
Islamic shrines, considered sacred
by Suﬁ muslims. Ansar Dine views
these shrines as idolatrous and,
thus, inconsistent with their aim
of spreading and ruling Azawad by
Sharia law.
With such a large humanitarian
crisis at hand and the potential for
the birth of a Sharia-ruled Al-Qaeda
linked state in Saharan Africa, the
costs of containing the crisis could
never be higher. he government
in Mali formally requested for
international support, following an
Islamist push into southern Mali.
It is reassuring to see that the call
for help answered so expediently,
with both the African Union and the
European Union oﬀering military
support to Mali. he French are at
the forefront of intervention, already
deploying 800 soldiers with hundreds
more arriving in the coming days. Air
strikes are a daily occurrence. he
British and Belgians are providing the
French intervention with equipment
or technical support.
In addition to the French boots on
the ground, thousands of African
Union troops are being deployed
as well. Neighbouring nations are
particularly interested in preventing
a terrorist haven from entrenching in
their backyards.
Curiously absent from the scene
is the United States. As the State
Department stated, no direct
military aid to Mali can be allocated
until leaders are appointed through
elections. hough troop deployment
does not seem like a possibility, the
Pentagon has been collaborating
with the French military, providing
intelligence from satellite images, as
well as intercepted signals.
he foreign involvement in Mali
represents an intriguing change in
global politics. America no longer
views itself as the global police force
to every conﬂict, wisely choosing the
cheaper and politically safer option of
supporting regional powers to solve
their issues. he debt crisis, as well
as the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan,
weighs in heavily.
he French, on the other hand, are
experiencing a renewed involvement
in world aﬀairs as a vocal leader.
Qaddaﬁ was toppled with the help
of French-led air support, a victory
for France and Sarkozy, even if it
didn’t keep him in office. French
involvement does pose some acute
problems, with Islamists threatening
attacks upon France itself. President
Hollande seems willing to risk the
possibility of a terrorist attack and
even entertains the possibility of
prolonged involvement in Mali, so
long as it means the end of a lawless
and unstable region so close to home.
For the most part, Malians have
welcomed the foreign troops happily.
Stabilizing the situation in Azawad
would allow closing refugee camps
that taxed the south of the country,
as well as its neighbours. For the
thousands of displaced, it means they
can return home.
