For the first match this year it was
definitely thermal weather as the
Ladies’ 1s went out to play RUMS in
the arctic conditions found at Har-
lington, on a pitch that was nearly
frozen, although this didn’t put a
damper on our spirits. We were out
to get them, as earlier in the season
they had beaten us by a fair few goals
to very few in return.
RUMS pressed hard from the start
and soon after the match began were
awarded a penalty corner, but solid
defending from Celia, Maria, Emma
and Kirsty meant we cleared the ball
easily. Play continued with some
good linking passes up the right
wing to Hazman, resulting in short
corners for us, although we were
unable to convert. Sorcha was on
a roll as she continuously took the
ball and dribbled past their defend-
ers, and great play from Kathryn and
Anna up front meant we had lots of
shots and a few near misses on goal.
We worked hard to keep the ball in
our possession and in our half of the
pitch.
The goal came just before half
time, when an unmarked Bryony saw
a space in the D and ran in. The ball
was passed back to Celia who sent it
in and a deflection from Bryony put
the ball through the keepers’ legs
and into the back of the goal. Text-
book finish. We were 1-0 up.
After half time, we knew RUMS
would be out to attack, but man
marking of their key player meant
they got more and more frustrated
and the ball didn’t get through. De-
fenders Kirsty and Emma kept strong
to prevent their forwards from hav-
ing chances to score, and beauti-
ful distribution from Celia at the
back meant we had more and more
chances at their end of the pitch.
Breakaways in the second half
meant that Kathryn had some one-
on-one situations with the goalie
and close chances on goal. We had
our captain Gigi back for the last 15
minutes of the game, who worked
well linking passes down the right
with Maria and Hazman, but strong
defending from the RUMS side
meant our chances were saved.
With great play from the whole
team, the final score was 1-0. Hope-
fully our winning streak will contin-
ue this term, and more goals will be
scored. Good luck ladies!

What is Wing Chun?
Wing Chun is a close quarters hand
to hand combat system developed in
Southern China which has recently
gained popularity due to the mar-
tial arts ﬁlm Ip Man released in 2008
which is loosely based on the life of
the late grand master Ip Man. Wing
Chun has also been made famous by
Bruce lee, who studied Wing Chun as
a direct disciple of Ip Man, Lee took
many of the principles and concepts
behind the martial art into developing
his own combat system Jeet Kune Do
(JKD).
