FRIDAY 18 JANUARY

Wandering the Lake District
Day 1: The Journey
At the usual time of 17:30hrs, ten
Fellwanderers met at the Union to
embark upon the annual Winter
Tour, this year to the Lake District.
After introductions, Matt and Ping
on their ﬁrst trip, discussion im-
mediately turned to the anticipated
freezing conditions — photos from
the 2010 tour had been circulating
and did not inspire conﬁdence. An
eﬃcient packing of the minibus (in-
cluding walking axes) meant we were
soon heading north through Hyde
Park.
Fortunately, the London traﬃc
didn’t prove too tortuous so we made
good time along the M1. A super-
market stop near Birmingham al-
lowed one vital aspect of the trip to
be sourced — food! An ambitious 20
minute target to be back in the bus
was not met but soon enough we
were motoring north again. Approxi-
mately ﬁve hours later, the minibus
arrived at hirlmere Recreation Hall,
complete with Christmas tree, where
we would be staying for the trip.
he hall was reassuringly — not to
mention surprisingly — warm so af-
ter unpacking the bus and sorting out
the food, roll mats and sleeping bags
were out and everyone bedded down
for the night.
Day 2: Rain
To all those who have been on many
Fellwanderers trips and suﬀered at
the hands of the spreadless cheese
and pickle sandwich, Saturday was
a dream come true. In the lunch-
preparation room, we found Claire
cutting into a large joint of ham and
butter on the table along with thick,
seeded white bread.
Sandwiches made and fully water-
proofed, we headed out into the rain
surprised by the relative warmth of
the morning. he walk started from
the hall bearing due east through
the Stair Wood and onto the ridge
containing Wainwright’s High Tove
(515m), Ambroth Fell (479m), High
Seat (608m), and Bleaberry Fell
(590m).
he going was fairly easy without
much steep ascent but due to the re-
cent heavy rain we feared spending
the whole day walking through deep
bogs. Fortunately, and to the intrigue
of many, the bogs were mostly frozen
giving the strange sensation of walk-
ing on something that should be soft
but is actually solid. Despite having
two large lakes on either side of the
ridge (Derwent Water and hirlmere
to the east and west, respectively)
good views were few and far between
as visibility was severely limited by
low cloud cover and mist in the val-
leys.
he circular(ish) walk ended back
at the hall just at the sun was go-
ing down. Dinner preparations were
quickly underway for James’ goulash
with dumplings. he recipe had been
attempted on a previous trip and
turned out partically sucessful — the
pitfall being the lack of scone-baking
experience in the group. his time,
there was no such trouble with Sa-
rah in charge of dumping-making so,
needless to say we ate heartily leav-
ing just enough room for a bread and
butter pudding.
Day 3: Wainwrights
Sunday promised a long walk, navi-
gated by Tom, to include ten Wain-
wrights in the North Western Fells —
we knew this was going to be tough so
started with a cooked English break-
fast. After a short drive from the hall
to Braithwaite we found ourselves
ascending steeply onto a horseshoe-
ridge, with eight of the peaks to be
climbed during the day. Before too
long the ascent was complete to take
us onto Grisedale Pike (791m) and
great views of the adjacent Whinlat-
ter Forrest Park as well as the rest of
Mark Bruggemann Sports Writer
the, mostly snow-topped, route.
We then continued along the ﬁrst
stretch of the ridge to bag Hopegill
Head (770m) and Whiteside (707m),
the latter providing an excellent view
of Crummock Water. We then lost
a lot height moving along the toe of
the ridgeline followed by another
steep ascent up to Grasmoor (852m).
Unfortunately, at this height we were
well and truly within the clouds,
again restricting visibility but not
dampening spirits. Continuing along
this branch of the horseshoe we as-
cended Crag Hill (837m) and, with
the sun low in the sky, Sail (773m).
While coming down from Sail the
path forked — one prong going down
into the valley and the other continu-
ing along the ridge. It was beginning
to get dark (entre chien et loup we
were told the French say) so this was
the decision point: head back to the
bus or carry on to two more Wain-
wrights? We agreed we had enough
light to safely bag Scar Crags (672m)
and Causey Pike (637m) so quickly
made tracks. Many of the surround-
ing villages were illuminated by their
street lights which made for a pretty
landscape despite the low light levels.
he walk between Causey Pike into
the valley felt very peaceful and we
had just enough daylight to ascend
our ﬁnal Wainwright of the day, Out-
side (568m). Unfortunately it was
too dark to attempt Barrow (455m)
so we proceeded, now in complete
darkness, with our headtorches on
towards the lights of Braithwaite to
collect the minibus.
We arrived back at the hall at about
six o’clock shattered, having ascend-
ed 1600m during the course of the
day.
Day 4: Rest or Run
Monday morning oﬀered a simple
choice — a gentle walk to recover
from the previous day or to run
23miles over 11 Wainwrights. Sen-
sibly the vast majority of the group
chose the former and headed oﬀ to-
wards Conniston Water, dropping oﬀ
the runners along the way. his is the
last we would see of them until the
evening.
After the walk we drove into Kes-
wick where the group further split
into those who fancied an afternoon
shopping and tea drinking, and those
who fancied a quick lap of Derwent
Water. After stocking up with addi-
tional supplies the two groups made
their way back to the hall to prepare
the much anticipated roast dinner.
At about six thirty Jack and Char-
lie returned from their run cover-
ing Glaramara (783m), Allen Crags
(785m), Great End (910m), Esk Pike
(885m), Bowfell (902m), Rossett
Pike (651m), Pike of Stickle (709m),
Loft Crag (680m), hunacar Knott
(723m), and High Raise, (802m) so
were unusually quiet for the rest of
the evening! he roast beef with all
the trimmings, including chestnuts,
was served soon after and certainly
lived up to expectation and left us all
immobile once the Christmas pud-
ding had also been demolished.
Day 5: Views and Singing
Tuesday morning started with a
drive to a car park near Conniston
to tackle another ﬁve Wainwrights in
the Southern Fells. he walk started
with a steep ascent with scrambling
sections — the pinnacle set the tone
for the rest the day. he sky was near
cloudless providing stunning views
of Morecambe bay in one direction
and snow capped peaks in the other.
Strangely, the snow on the fells made
them seem much larger and more
dramatic, more akin to an Alpine en-
vironment, than they actually are.
he route followed another ridge
around Levers Water and Low Water.
he going was mostly good though
very undulating meaning the day
was characterised by lots of ascent.
First, and after many false summits,
we were up Weatherlam (763m) and
stopped for lunch in the sun — a rar-
ity this year and made all the sweeter
by roast beef sandwiches! Taking
every opportunity to skate on the
frozen lakes, we made our way to-
wards Swirl How (802m) followed by
Brim Fell (796m) and he Old Man of
Conniston (803m). Here, it was pos-
sible to see both Snowdon, despite
it being over 100miles away, and the
Isle Of Man.
On the way to the ﬁnal Wainwright
of the day, Dow Crag (778m), the
sun started to go down. he reddish-
orange sky across the sea was mag-
niﬁcent with the lights on the Isle of
Man looking as though the sea were
on ﬁre. he oﬀshore windfarm only
added to the picture. We descended
down an old quarry road looking
into this scenery which, I think, had
a calming eﬀect on us all.
Taa was in charge of the evening’s
dinner: a delicious hai Green Cur-
ry. Just after dinner the village carol
singers knocked on the hall door. We,
of course, let them in and requested
“Oh Come All Ye Faithful” followed
by “Good King Wenceslas” and sang
along with zest! It seemed a ﬁtting
event for our last night in the Lakes
and left those from cities and abroad
slightly bemused.
She’ll be coming round the
mountain when she comes...
It looks cold. Apart from Pink
Hat Man; he looks snuggly.
Sorry, what about wandering fells is fun?
Bleak, wet, cold... only one smile among them!
