FRIDAY 18 JANUARY
“
Holocaust Memorial Day at IC
Listen to an account. Step into his shoes, walk around in them.
Don’t forget.
On the evening of this coming
Thursday 24th of January we, at Im-
perial College, will have the honour
and the privilege to hear the account
of Mr Yisrael Abelesz, a survivor of
the Aushwitz-Birkenau concentra-
tion camp, to tell us his experiences
on the occasion of Holocaust Me-
morial Day and answer our ques-
tions.
Auschwitz, “has become a symbol
of the Holocaust, representing man’s
inhumanity to man”, as described by
the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
It was the largest of the Nazi kill-
ing camps, where approximately 1.1
million men, women and children,
including Jews, gypsies, the handi-
capped, homosexuals, Soviet pris-
oners of war and political dissidents,
were killed, out of a total estimate of
11 million assassinations through-
out the Holocaust across Europe at
the hands of the Nazis, from 1933 to
1945.
Holocaust Memorial Day is a day
of remembrance held annually on
the anniversary of the liberation of
Auschwitz, by Soviet soldiers. Mr
Yisrael Abelesz was interned as a
teenager in Auschwitz-Birkenau and
after the war, he came to England to
work and bring up his family. His
grandson is a current student at Im-
perial College.
Over six decades after the end of
World War II, two generations have
passed and the generation that lived
through the Holocaust is dwindling
in numbers. Why must we listen to
them and tell our children about the
atrocities they faced? By listening to
a personal account, behind mere fig-
ures, we can be led to empathy and
therefore to action, in a world that
is too often infected by epidemic
apathy. Indeed, as Lithuanian re-
searcher Vladimir Orlov, involved
with investigations into the Nazi
killing camps in his country recently
pointed out, it is “insane” that his-
torians remember the names of the
murderers, allowing them to live on
in history, while the victims remain
anonymous.
Hearing an account first-hand is
not the same as reading history that
has been watered down. As Profes-
sor Dinur, famously said “If we wish
to live and bequeath life to our off-
spring, if we believe that we are to
pave the way to the future, then we
must first of all not forget”. He sug-
gests that witnesses that survived
ensure a certain moral strength and
we cannot allow their decreasing
numbers to create a moral, cultural
and educational vacuum, particu-
larly when genocidal ideologies and
Holocaust denial persist.
The theme of this year’s Holocaust
Memorial Day is “Communities To-
gether: Build a Bridge”, to remind
us that the strongest communities
are those that respect difference
and create connections, to stop the
spread of hate in our own time.
Come and hear an account of a
survivor of the Holocaust, while you
can.
