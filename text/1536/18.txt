FRIDAY 18 JANUARY

Failed your exams, huh?
ast year, a friend of mine
failed his PhD. He turned
to me for advice.
I reviewed the case, and
discovered that he had not
been oﬀered a second viva, contrary
to the university’s regulations. With-
out a second viva, he had no oppor-
tunity to defend his thesis orally. he
examiners had little experience of
examining PhDs and there was evi-
dence of bias in the assessment of the
thesis. When the examiners told my
friend the bad news, they barely gave
any reasons.
A few weeks after receiving my
friend’s appeal letter, the university’s
appeal board held that the regula-
tions had been breached. My friend
was allowed to resubmit his thesis
with new examiners. his experience
inspired me to set up Alpha Academ-
ic Appeals, which advises and assists
students in their appeals.
When I was a lecturer, I marked
hundreds of exam scripts. Few aca-
demics will deny that marking is, on
the whole, a soul-sapping task. On
one occasion, a student contacted me
to say there was an error in his script.
My office partner at the time, a more
senior academic, advised me to say
that the result is ﬁnal and to refuse
to revisit the script. I thought it fair
to double check. To my surprise, the
marks were added incorrectly. Exam-
iners, however experienced, will oc-
casionally make mistakes, and those
will not always be picked up by a sec-
ond examiner.
So what if you fail an exam and want
to appeal? here are two grounds for
appealing against a decision of the
Board of Examiners, and you will
note that disagreeing with the aca-
demic judgment of the examiners is
not one of them. hey are:
1. hat the exam(s) was not con-
ducted in accordance with the rel-
evant instructions, regulations or
requirements.
L
Daniel Sokol gives his advice on writing appeals for those with
legitimate grounds
2. Where new evidence is provided
of circumstances which might have
adversely aﬀected your performance
in the exams.
Whatever your reasons, they must
ﬁt within at least one of the above.
You must therefore ﬁnd out what the
relevant “instructions, regulations or
requirements” are. hey can be found
on the Imperial website (http://
www3.imperial.ac.uk/registry/pro-
ceduresandregulations).
Illness and bereavement are often
invoked as reasons for appealing an
exam result. he ‘Guidance to Stu-
dents’ is clear on this issue:
“You are reminded that if you be-
lieve your performance in exams may
be aﬀected by illness (or by other
personal circumstances) you should
report the matter to your tutor be-
fore sitting the exams, or as soon as
possible thereafter. You should not
wait for your results before deciding
to notify the College of the situation.
“Information regarding extenuat-
ing circumstances received after the
exams will not be considered as the
grounds for an appeal, unless there
are exceptional reasons why this in-
formation could not be provided at
the time.”
If you have been withdrawn from
your course, there are diﬀerent
grounds of appeal, which can be
found in Appendix 1 of the Regula-
tions. Whatever the appeal, the key
point is to refer to the appropriate
grounds of appeal and to the rules
and regulations which were allegedly
breached.
Finally, Imperial College is a uni-
versity, and universities, like NHS
trusts and local authorities, are pub-
lic bodies. his means that, in making
decisions, Imperial must adhere to
recognised principles of public law. It
must, for example, follow a fair pro-
cedure and avoid bias. In short, its
decisions must be fair.
All this can be daunting, espe-
cially after receiving the bad news
of a failed exam or withdrawal from
the course. You may wish to con-
tact a College Tutor or the Imperial
College Student Adviser for help. It
costs nothing, but remember to act
promptly. You generally only have
four weeks from the date of receiving
official notiﬁcation of your results to
submit your appeal, along with sup-
porting evidence.
You want to give yourself plenty
of time to read the rules and regula-
tions, write a persuasive appeal letter,
and gather any evidence to support
your claims. Ask others to read your
appeal letter and make suggestions
on how to improve it.
One ﬁnal point. Statistically, the
chances of a successful appeal are
low. Most appeals are weak and right-
ly dismissed. here is no entitlement
to passing exams, however high the
tuition fees. Yet, some appeals have
strong grounds and good prospects
of success. In such cases, students
should be encouraged to appeal.

Write a per-
suassive ap-
peal letter,
and gather
evidence to
support your
claims.

Letters
In Felix 11/01, an article attempted to
compare workloads at Imperial and
Oxbridge. Was the writer aware that
Oxford only has 20 teaching weeks per
year? Was he aware of the importance
of the Supervision/tutorial system at
Oxbridge?
Very poor research leading to mislead-
ing conclusions!!
