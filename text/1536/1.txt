Business school set exams
in breach of College rules
Imperial College fails to provide suf-
ﬁcient clarity on international student
tariﬀs, as perceived by students. Impe-
rial College Union intends to lobby the
University amidst growing apprehen-
sion among overseas students.
Imperial College Union will lobby
College to say how much the entire
degree will cost when students are ap-
plying, and give current students infor-
mation on the cost of the rest of their
degree. As currently students are some-
times in the dark about how much they
will have to pay as tuition fees for the
next year.
he current average annual cost
incurred by an overseas student of
£25,000, a mere £47 short of equivalent
rate in place at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology ($40,372/ £25,047).
he latest fee rises come as no surprise,
being synonymous with the trend of
previous academic years, with year-on-
year increases. he objection is also to
students not having clear information
on how their fees will rise while still
doing their degree. his came to light
in a paper at Union Council by Wasim
Khouri. He said to Felix: “Overseas
tuition fees have risen to an average of
£24,000 after another unexpected in-
crease this year. With a struggling econ-
omy, more and more students are facing
problems with payments and budget-
ing. We are now working very

Imperial College Business School
has recently been conducting their
examinations in a manner that has
been deemed unfair by students and
is potentially a violation of the Col-
lege’s own policy. The breach of the
regulations has been revealed by a
student who wished to remain anon-
ymous.
On Thursday 10 January, final year
students on the management course
were required to sit a two hour exam
in the evening and then, seemingly
against College rules, another the
next morning. The first exam in it-
self may also not have meet the re-
quired standards and expectations.
A student has also told us that
there were no sample/specimen
questions and no past papers given
to the students, all of whom were left
in as state of uncertainty.
Speaking of the exam, Felix were
told: “I didn’t even know how many
marks or how many questions or
what it was on!”
The exams were held for the
School’s Joint Honours Programme,
a course where students do the fi-
nal year of their degrees full time in
business. These difficulties therefore
have a great effect on people’s entire
degree and have the potential to
gravely affect the relevant students.
Felix requested the relevant policy
from Imperial and received a “Col-
lege Notice” from last year for Man-
agement Board implementations.
