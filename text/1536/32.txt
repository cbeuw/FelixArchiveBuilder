A timely reminder from the best

POSTGRAD NEARLY
SLIPS ON ICE
NOTHING.
IT’S FREEZING.
SNOW MARQUEE
SET TO WARM
HEARTS OF NATION
Exhibition Road played host to
a dramatic incident on Tues-
day when a postgraduate stu-
dent nearly slipped on a patch of
ice, before steadying himself and
continuing on with his journey.
Chaos engulfed the exterior of the
Science Museum for a brief few sec-
ondswhenthestudent placedhisright
footonanewlyfrozenpuddleofwater.
Nearly-slipper Jerome Ross,
who is currently writing a thesis en-
titled ‘Gravitational stability problems
and their relationship with the dis-
cography of Duran Duran’, opined
on the treachery of the weather:
“It was pretty treacherous,” he said.
“My foot kind of gave way and
I thought I was going to slip, but
then I didn’t, which was great.”
Despite his close brush with the
remorseless ice, Jerome isn’t hop-
ing for mass thawing anytime soon:
“Looking back, I’d say this is
the most exciting thing that’s
happened to me this week.”
After ruminating on the affair, he
concluded: “I have no regrets.”
Following the huge festive success
of animated short The Snowman and
The Snowdog, the Entirely Fictional
Queen’s Lawn Assocation (EFQLA)
announced on Wednesday that it
had been inspired to commission
a new 20-minute animated feature
for transmission next Christmas.
Entitled The Snowman, The Snow-
dog and The Snow Marquee, the
plot will revolve around a young boy
whose ambitions stretch beyond
mere snow-based creature sculpture:
“In the spirit of entrepreneurship,
our main character - eight-year-old
Kenny - will quickly move on from
sculpting people and animals to fully-
fledged architecture in the hope of
mapping out his future career,” said
EFQLA spokesman Dennis Lardon.
“At the end, everyone flies to the
North Pole for the annual Snowman
Careers Fair and they all have a
great time before everything melts.”
Executives are seeking a mu-
sical artist for a heartwarming
Christmas anthem. Lardon di-
vudged that EFQLA are “trying to
talk with Keane at the moment. Ap-
parently they’re really interested!”
Pedant’s’ Corner
The grand return of a section no-one was asking for
hat’s right. We’re celebrating ped-
antry in all of its forms once again.
Why? Just check out this absolute
clunker (left) delivered by our very
own esteemed Editor-in-Chief last
week. With one inappropriate con-
traction this well-meaning Facebook
update undid all it set out to do.
Causing a rightful ﬂurry of contro-
versy, the debacle opened up a thrill-
ing debate about the usage of gram-
mar. Poor show.
Make sure you ‘like’ Felix on Face-
book (facebook.com/feliximperial)
for regular updates from the Editor,
including dubious musical recom-
mendations.
Could this be the worst headline ever?
