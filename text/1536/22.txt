Maciej Matuszeski reviews Ray Monk’s Oppenheimer biography
ay Monk has long been
highly regarded as a
skilled biographer. A
philosopher himself, his
1991 biography of Witt-
genstein won him the John Llewellyn
Rhys Prize. In his latest work, howev-
er, Monk has chosen to explore the life
of one of America’s most controversial
scientists – Robert Oppenheimer.
While currently best remembered
for his work on the Manhattan Pro-
ject, he was a fascinating and complex
man. At ﬁrst sight, indeed, he appears
to be a man of great inconsistencies.
He was always academically brilliant
yet, while studying at Cambridge, he
become so depressed with feelings
about his inadequacies that he alleg-
edly attempted to murder PMS Black-
ett with a poisoned apple. In the early
1930s he was so out of touch with
current aﬀairs that he was unaware of
the Wall Street Crash yet twenty years
later his left wing political sympathies
cost him his security clearance.
Monk, however, argues that
throughout his life, Oppenheimer was
deeply driven by a goal to achieve his
full potential. In other words, to be the
centre of everything he could.
his is a convincingly argued theory
and the book shows the decade of re-
search that Monk has devoted to it.
his is a truly insightful work and is
surely set to become the deﬁnitive text
on Oppenheimer.
R
“he story is a poem disguised in
prose”, says the introduction to the
2007 edition of this novel.
It is exactly that.
he story has no order or structure;
arguably a mere progression in the
lives of our four characters. he book
is a true exhibition of the author’s ad-
mirable ability to narrate: a gripping
story where nothing happens.
Four people: a middle aged man, a
burnt body of an explorer, a twenty
year old nurse and a sapper from
Punjab; all in a lonely landscape of
rural Italy with nothing to do but
wait, breathe, observe and let the
emotions of the terrible war ﬂow back
to the place where they will stay for
the rest of their lives.
hings can happen at 2am in the
morning as well as at midday or dawn:
there is no time or obligation, just the
sun, the sky, a library and candles.
What is the story about?
Objectively about nothing.
Just like life.
What have you done during your
weekend?
Nothing.
Ask me again and I’ll tell you what
made me laugh or cry.
Sentences are not precise.
No, not necessarily, not always.
“White sound” – …? Yes, a sound
that makes you blind, oh yes, you just
realise three sentences later that the
expression was actually a metaphor.
Michael Ondaatje takes you
through their experiences as paint-
brush strokes across an empty can-
vas. Images, scenes… an impression, a
thought… the narrators vary, the four
characters remember the past that
brought them here. It establishes the
tone: memories, ﬂashes – you might
hear the same story twice, the second
time with another hint of emotion.
You are taken to the desert of Lib-
ya across the golden sands and into
the sweaty rooms of Cairo and then
back to the valley in Tuscany, mined,
shelled and abandoned. You are im-
mersed in the war, crossing muddy
ﬁelds at night under the light of bomb-
ing ﬁre. You experience the horror of
hospitals, nurses expected to act like
priests accompanying – constantly –
the souls imprisoned in their broken
bodies to their death.
here are paragraphs that make you
stop.
Again?
It was just absolutely beautiful and
exact. How did he manage to say that
so well?
…sentences you could rip oﬀ the
book and put on the wall.
