Engineers left frustrated over exchange
South Hall in Berkeley,
although it looks like the
setting for Downton Abbey
(Division of Ecology and Evolution),
and Dr Irene Miguel-Aliaga and
Dr Rill Bartke (Institute of Clinical
Science) were all awarded Starting
Grants of over €1m for research
projects spanning the next five.
Additionally, Professor Ed Hinds
(Department of Physics), Christos
Vasillicos (Department of Aero-
nautics) and Peter Kohl (National
Heart and Lung Institute) were all
awarded grants of over €2m each
from the ERC’s Advanced Grants
fund.
Professor Donal Bradley, Pro-Rec-
tor for Research at Imperial College
London, said: “This latest outstand-
ing success in securing multiple
awards from the ERC’s highly com-
petitive funding schemes provides
further recognition of the strength
of research being undertaken across
the College. Our involvement in two
of the first round of ERC Synergy
projects is a testament to the mul-
ti-disciplinary research ethos that
pervades the College and, in both
cases, also emphasises the College’s
focus on the translation of research
into practical solutions that address
some of society’s most pressing is-
sues.”
A foreign exchange scheme that, in
previous years, had often allowed
a student from each department in
the Faculty of Engineering to study
for a year at the University of Cali-
fornia has this year drastically re-
duced its places. As a result of a
decrease in the number of students
at the University of California who
wish to participate in the project
only two places were available this
year for Imperial students.
The programme is open to stu-
dents in their final year – who apply
in autumn of the preceding year. The
University of California curriculum
involves to those studied at Imperial
and students must also complete an
“independent research project”.
A third year mechanical engi-
neering student, told Felix that he
“applied for the program and went
through a motivational letter stage
and then an interview stage in front
of three lecturers from the mechani-
cal engineering department and was
selected mid-November”. He was
told that he “might have another in-
terview at faculty level” but that on
the last day of term was told that he
“won’t be going”. He added that he
was “deeply upset about this” and
that, so far, he has “been unsuc-
cessful in trying to gather reasons
for why the faculty has chosen the
other departments’ members and
not mechanical engineering (espe-
cially since it is the biggest in terms
of size) without further interviews
or selection procedures”.
Dr Pat Leevers, Mechanical En-
gineering Director of Courses, re-
sponded that the Department was
“to say the least, disappointed in
the outcome of this year’s U Cal ex-
change scheme”. He praised the can-
didates who “had put time and effort
into preparing strong applications”
and expressed “bitter disappoint-
ment” at how the student who was
selected by the department was “un-
successful at the Faculty level, where
the odds of success seem to dimin-
ish each year”. He added that the
Department would “certainly now
be looking at alternative options to
the present Faculty-wide scheme”.
Doug Hunt, Imperial College Un-
ion Deputy President (Education),
commented on the exchange pro-
gramme saying: “It is quite hard
to get more than 2 [places] as we
need students from UC wishing to
come here to be able to send more
there. Currently that isn’t happening
though. Only way of creating more
places at US universities is having
more US partners but this is more
admin for the College and depart-
ments.”
American students have offered
insight into the possible reason for
the decrease in incoming applicants.
It may be due to Imperial offering
only year long exchanges. Other uni-
versities offer single terms. As the
system in the USA works on credits,
it could mean that students from the
USA are less prepared to leave for an
entire year as it would require hard-
er work when they returned. This
would be because year away could
harm their credit choices more than
just a term abroad. At the time of
going to print Adrian Hawksworth,
College Assistant Registrar (Place-
ments), who until recently had been
in charge of the programme, was
unavailable for comment.
The European Research Council
(ERC) has awarded over €25m to
Imperial College in the latest fund-
ing round. These grants are for 11
projects, and these include two pres-
tigious synergy grants that promote
partnerships in academic research.
The Synergy grant scheme was
piloted this year, it allocates up to
€15m over six years for projects that
aim to enhance collaborations be-
tween researchers that can produce
results that would not be possible
to produce working alone. Conse-
quently, the collaborations enhance
the complementary skills, knowl-
edge and resources available to re-
searchers.
The ERC received over 700 ap-
plications for Synergy grants, but
only 11 projects were funded across
the EU. The first Synergy project
at Imperial is the “Intelligent im-
plantable modulator of Vagus nerve
function for treatment of obesity”
(i2MOVE). This received a grant of
over €7m and was awarded to Pro-
fessor Christopher Toumazou and
Professor Sir Stephen Bloom, from
the Departments of Electrical Engi-
neering and Medicine respectively.
This team will create a device that
mimics the response of the vagus
nerve after eating, suppressing the
appetite of a patient; achieved by
combining their expertise in bioen-
gineering and endocrinology. The
second project grant was awarded
to Professor Daniel Rueckert, from
the Department of Computing, in
partnership with colleagues at Kings
College and Oxford. The project
is entitled “The Developing Hu-
man Connectome Project” (dHCP),
which aims to provide an insight
into neuropsychiatry conditions
such as autism; achieved by using
MRI to track brain connectivity in
foetuses and newborn children. The
project has received a grant of over
€14m, of which €3.250m will go to
Professor Rueckert.
Although the synergy grants are
the most high profile, the College
has also received another €15m in
grants by the ERC in Starting and
Advanced Grants. Dr Michelle Mo-

A recent study by High Flier Re-
search claims that the top 100
graduate employers focussing on
finding graduate recruits on a small
number of universities. A list of
twenty universities targeted found
Warwick University at the top and
Imperial at 12th place.
The majority of graduate employ-
ers including BP, Civil Service, IBM,
Goldman Sachs, PwC, Google and
HSBC concentrate on this small
handful of universities with some
highly rated institutions such as St
Andrews not appearing in the list.
Cambridge came a respectable 4th
behind Nottingham and Manches-
ter and Oxford is considered the
7th most targeted university. Impe-
rial comes behind Bristol, Durham,
Birmingham, Bath, Leeds and Shef-
field University, but thankfully not
UCL – so we can all celebrate a bit.
The report showed a fall in the
number of graduate jobs available
with a drop of 0.8 per cent in en-
try-level graduate jobs over the last
year. It was revealed that one-in-
five firms are scaling back funding
for their graduate recruitment pro-
grammes compared with last year.
Firms are more likely to use social
media to promote their graduate
schemes with 71% of firms planning
to increase the use of this approach
and one-in-four saying they would
be putting fewer resources into uni-
versity career fairs.
The Graduate Market in 2013 re-
port indicates that students are be-
ing approached earlier, with 42 of
the top 100 firms saying they were
more likely to promote graduate
roles to first years than in previous
years. 28 of the top firms claimed to
be targeting penultimate year stu-
dents more than they have done in
the past. So get ready to be tweeted
at.

they want Warwick – says
