A long term strategist
Tim Arbabzadah interviews the new Pro-Rector (Education)
Debra Humphris
Tim Arbabzadah: Does your back-
ground help you in your current
role? Did you gain – I hate this word
– transferrable skills?
Debra Humphris: It keeps me fairly
grounded in what we’re trying to
achieve. Universities are extraordinary
institutions and Imperial is deﬁnitely
one of the best. Not just in terms of
the amazing research that we do that
transforms peoples lives, but the edu-
cation and the whole experience that
equally transforms the lives of our stu-
dents. here’s nothing more satisfying
for me than seeing students ﬂourish.
We should give them an outstanding
experience, and just set them oﬀ to do
amazing things in life and society.
TA: You’ve only just come in, so I
guess is one of your aims to start
meeting student reps so they know
that right up at the top there is
someone that they know?
DH: Of course, I met with Doug
[Hunt, Deputy President (Educa-
tion] Becky [Lane, Deputy President
(Welfare)] and Paul [Beaumont, Un-
ion President] before I took up post.
For me the Student Union is a really
important part of the wider student
experience, and how we work in part-
nership is really matters. As part of my
background research on the College I
read the 2011 NSS Response, it was a
really helpful insight on the issues that
matter to our students. Recently I’ve
worked with Paul and Doug on the
2012 report. We had some interest-
ing conversations to make sure it’s ab-
solutely accurate, because it wouldn’t
help anybody if it wasn’t accurate. It’s
a really helpful way to focus on the key
areas where we can enhance the edu-
cation and student experience, but we
won’t be able to do it all at once. he
outgoing graduates who complete the
NSS in 2013 might have very diﬀerent
views from the previous cohorts, but
there will always be improvements we
can make. My normal modus operan-
di is that my job is education and stu-
dent experience, and therefore I need
to be close to the student body, listen-
ing to their views, being accessible to
students for me is really important.
TA: Some students may feel a bit
intimidated talking to a higher up
person and attempt to act in a dif-
ferent way around you. Would you
rather a warts and all portrayal of
modern student life?
DH: I remember at my interview when
asked about what my style was I said
“what you see is what you get”. I would
rather students felt able to have a very
straightforward conversation with me,
because I can’t see the point of doing
anything otherwise, it’s far better that
we’re frank and open with each other.
TA: What do you think the inter-
net’s role is? Is there a big challenge
in using the internet eﬀectively
rather than just because you can?
DH: here are a number of universi-
ties around the world who have taken
signiﬁcant steps to open up online re-
sources. Most notable is Edx started
by Harvard and MIT with others now
joining. What I have been exploring
with colleagues is that we have’digital
natives’ coming through in terms of
students for whom technology is nor-
mal. he question now is how then do
we combine that in the most eﬀective
way to enhance the educational ex-
perience. I’m also very interested in
where we as Imperial want to position
ourselves in terms of that online com-
munity. In February I’m bringing a
group of people together internally as
part of a strategy development process
to consider why and what we want to
do about this. here’s no doubt we
could do more and but ﬁrst we need to
be clear about our strategy for that? I’d
be quite keen to explore how we might
use some of our online resources to
better encourage young people in
secondary schools to engage with
science, technology and maths.
TA: A lot of universities get
lambasted for not doing
enough for outreach to get
people into university? What
is the universities place in this?
Or would you say that the Govern-
ment unfairly point the blame at
the universities for a school sys-
tem that is their jurisdic-
tion?
DH: With the change
to tuition fees for
Home/EU under-
graduate students
the Oﬃce of Fair
Access (OFFA)
has required us in
our access agree-
ment to make
clear how we
make addi-
tional invest-
ment in stu-
dent support
and outreach
activities. As
tuition fee
income in-
creases so the
grant from the
Higher Education Funding Council
for England (HEFCE ) is reducing, So
we’re using investing more in out-
reach, we can’t do everything so we
have to be really quite strategic and
focused on what makes a diﬀerence.
here’s one thing about encourag-
ing young people to consider higher
education, but it’s another thing to
encourage them to apply to Imperial.
Our outreach team does great work;
we’ve got some great developments
such as Reach Out Lab and the num-
ber of schools that they engage with.
We’re at a point where we probably
need to take stock and review where
we can most eﬀectively focus our ef-
forts.
TA: At Imperial, Departments are
quite autonomous. Would you say
the way forward is making things
uniform across all Departments?
Or is it a better approach to look at
departments individually?
DH: Well in terms of education we
also have to operate within the frame-
work of the Quality Assurance Agen-
cy Quality Code, and one of the issues
this raises is how we ensure parity of
experience. here will be disciplinary
diﬀerences: chemistry
is not the same
as mechanical
engineering.
Where we’ve
made a com-
mitment to
students in
our quality
framework and
in our regula-
tions we need to
ensure we de-
liver
our commitments.
Feedback has always been the one
that people highlight, not just at Im-
perial. In terms of assessment and
feedback I think there’s a bigger is-
sue around what’s feedback, how do
you know you’re getting feedback?
What does feedback look like? Help-
ing students understand what that
really means. And in terms of assess-
ment, I suspect that we need to think
about and really understand the pur-
pose of assessment. What does the as-
sessment look like? I would hazard a
guess that there are areas in which we
might be over assessing students for
whatever reason. If we really want to
focus on assessment and feedback we
need to think about what constitutes
assessment. When do we need to as-
sess? What are we assessing in terms
of the learning outcomes for particu-
lar courses?
TA: he diﬃculty, in my view, with
making everything standardised
involves chasing up and ensuring
every lecturer does something to a
perfect standard?
DH: In reality there is variation in all
things, we are all somewhere in a range
in a distribution curve. But I go back
to the point that it’s about being clear
about what feedback is and signalling
that very clearly to students. If we’ve
made a promise about when we’ll give
you feedback then we need to keep
our promises. Still there’s a bigger is-
sue about what is assessment, how are
we assessing, what assessment do we
actually need to do. here’s a bigger
piece of work to do on this.
TA: Are these sorts of issues that
you’re taking a back to square one
approach, rather than building on
current framework? Maybe think-
ing: perhaps let’s dismantle and put
the framework back together again?
DH: With the support of the Manage-
ment Board in the next 6 months I’ll
be taking forward a process to re-
fresh and reﬁne an education and
student experience strategy. here
will be a range of provocations
that will invite students and staﬀ
to contribute going to a whole set
of elements that should shape our
strategy. his has to build upon the
great education and experience we
oﬀer and to take it further. As part
of the process I’ll be encouraging us
all to look up and out to consider
best practice from across the globe.
Once we’ve decided what we want to
do it strikes me that Imperial will do
it with gusto!
My strategy is to take forward a
conversation across the College to
develop a strategy that engages the
genius of the staﬀ and students in the
College. he focus is the education
and wider student experience and
everybody should have a voice in this
process.
TA: Last question. So would you say
that the educational experience of
a student can improve a student’s
satisfaction and welfare as a whole?
Do you think the educational expe-
rience is a stem to their general en-
joyment of university?
DH: Well, students fundamentally
come to the university to take part in
an educational experience to receive
an award from the institution. hat’s
not just the educational experience; it
included the wider support that is in
place: the accommodation, the cater-
ing, the sports and recreation, vol-
unteering, careers advice, disability
service etc. here are a whole range
of elements that are there to support
and help students to not just on their
programme but in the wider experi-
ence as a student. I’m interested in
the rounded genius of our students,
because it’s more than just their pro-
gramme. It’s the students that take
part in volunteering, get involved in
outreach in schools, sports, fund rais-
ing and the other elements. hat’s the
rounded genius of our students and I
really like to work with the Union and
students to ﬁnd a way to further en-
hance such opportunities.
