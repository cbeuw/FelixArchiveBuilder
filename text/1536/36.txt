Union Survey - last chance to win an iPad Mini!
At the end of last academic year we ran
the ﬁrst ever Union Survey and we have
already made positive changes as a result
of your feedback. Our ‘You said, we did’
campaign highlights the changes we have
made.
One of the most visible changes we
made was in launching this new website!
You said that the old site was slow and
hard to navigate, so when we were
thinking about our new site these were
the two most important elements for us.
Other changes include the reintroduction
of a wide-range of real ales in the Union
bars, anEveryday Value range in the Union
Shop and a comprehnsive Rep Finder that
helps you ﬁnd out how represents you in
College and the Union.
Don’t forget, the Union Survey closes
this Sunday! This really does help us
to improve everything we do, so help
us keep improving for you. We will be
selecting winners at random for the prize
draw and announcing them online.

The National Student Survey started
today, which gives ﬁnal years the chance
to show their satisfaction to the general
public on the education they have
received here at Imperial.
The results of the NSS are used in
national league table rankings, so be
honest when you are ﬁlling it in, as
prospective students and other interested
parties will be using this data to compare
the quality of education each university
and course offers.
The NSS also raises important issues
that College and the Union can respond
to. Every year the Union publishes a
response to the NSS with the aim of
improving the student experience across
the whole College.
Last year, 71% of ﬁnal years ﬁlled in
the NSS and we are hoping to beat
this percentage to give a more fully
representative view of how satisﬁed
Imperial’s students are. To help make
the survey as useful as possible we
have a few tips to those who have yet to
complete it:
1. Rate your entire degree, not your final
year.
The NSS is very different to SOLE.
Use SOLE to discuss the positives and

Keep up-to-date with your Sabbaticals at:
negatives of your year and NSS for the
positives and negatives of your whole
degree.
2. Don’t be neutral.
On many questions you will these
options: strongly agree, slightly agree,
neutral, slightly disagree, strongly
disagree. Neutral responses give us no
indication as to whether things need
improving or are going very well. Make
your voice count.
3. Give detailed comments on open text
boxes.
There are free-text boxes on the survey.
Be as detailed as possible if you want to
make an impact.
So if you are a ﬁnal year, ﬁll in the survey
now at www.thestudentsurvey.com.
You can also win a £20 Union Shop
voucher or a Summer Ball ticket for
completing the survey!
Also, you don’t need to wait until a survey
to make changes in your Department.
