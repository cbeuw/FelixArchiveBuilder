A Single Man Who is
Tom Ford?
Born in Austin
Texas, 1961, Tom
Ford started his
career acting
in television
commercials.
Although getting
a degree in
architecture
he eventually
settled into the
fashion world
rising to the top
of the business. A
Single Man is his
directorial debut
after leaving the
fashion house
Gucci.
Tom Ford, the world-renowned fash-
ion designer most famous for fishing
Gucci out of bankruptcy, steps behind
the camera for the first time to create
a work of art, beauty and nostalgia.
Pre-conceptions that can usually arise
about a first-time director who used to
be a fashion designer – beautiful cos-
tumes, sumptuous music, overdone
visuals, good-looking actors – do make
their standard appearances but with A
Single Man, Ford goes a step further,
exploring social division, prejudice and
solitude.
Told from our leading protagonist’s
point of view, George (Colin Firth),
an English professor in Los Angeles,
is planning to commit suicide after re-
alising that with the death of his lover
Jim (Matthew Goode), his life is not
worth living anymore. He has a gun
prepared, has written all the goodbye
letters, and has sorted out his finances.
All he needs to do is to get through
the day, teach his class, have dinner
with his close and possibly only friend
Charley, (Julianne Moore) and then it’s
goodbye cruel world.
But not everything goes quite ac-
cording to George’s perfectly laid-out
plan. An intrigued student Kenny (Ni-
cholas Hoult) takes peculiar interest
in George, an attraction that seems to
involve fascination for both academia
and sex, and this leads to several,
lengthy discussions about life and its
surrounding moralities. He has curi-
ous encounters with a male prostitute,
Carlos (model Jon Kortajarena), and
Colin Firth takes a look back at his life in a Single Man
his neighbours that make him question
his decision to end his life.
George is alone, living as an outcast
and Ford makes sure that we see this in
as many different ways as possible. He’s
an English man living in America, he’s
all alone in an empty glass house and
he’s a gay man living in the 60’s. Firth,
in the role of his lifetime, gives a mag-
netic performance and does not falter
for one minute. He is quiet, yet subtly
powerful, perfectly reflecting the char-
acter’s on-going grief and frustration
towards his empty life that seems to
have no hopeful future. The awards
buzz is certainly well-deserved.
The supporting cast also does an
equally phenomenal job. Moore is
on faultless form as the sad, alcoholic
loner who is so miserable that she con-
siders having a fling with George who
she knows is gay. She tries to mask her
fear and worry with endless booze, a
perfectly decorated house and heavy
make-up but in the end nothing lasts
forever and she’s back to her depressed
self. Moore captures the struggles
and weaknesses of her character and
keeps up flawless chemistry with Firth.
Goode finally lands a role where he
can put his good looks to fine use as
George’s young dead lover. George’s
flashbacks including Jim show how
happy and content our protagonist
was as a result of this one man and we
can all understand why. Their scenes
are intimate, sweet and at times, quite
comical. Hoult, a dedicated student full
of talking points, intelligent views and
a genuine interest towards George, has
a young, fresh charm that sets a clear
contrast between Hoult’s and Firth’s
characters.
Ford dazzles us with his confidence
in using various visual techniques. His
bold use of colours showing sharp con-
trast shows both the grim, grey 60’s, as
well as the more detailed, fashionable
interiors and atmosphere of the more
flamboyant, fun-loving characters. His
frequent use of zoom-ins skilfully adds
something more erotic and intimate
to the narrative. Combine that with
some slow-motion filming and the ef-
fect is doubled. Does he rely on this too
much? Perhaps. But this certainly isn’t
all style and no substance.
A Single Man may sound like a com-
plete downer, but under Ford’s steady,
beautiful direction and anchored by
strong performances from the cast,
this goes beyond the sad, tear-jerking
message of loss and tragedy into some-
thing more meaningful, exploring life
and its worth. An emotionally alive
picture from an ensemble of artistic
talent, this moving experience should
not be missed.
The
Oscars
Breakdown
You might recog-
nise this man, it’s
Neil Patrick Harris!
I admit I had to go
on IMDB.com
to find out he
is. Apparently
he starred
in Starship
Troopers,
remember?
His song
and dance
routine was
an enjoyable start
to the ceremony.

Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin literally de-
scended to host the Oscars. Their partnership
was a bit hit and miss but some well aimed
Jewish jokes about Inglourious Basterds had
the audience in stitches. ‘The Motherload!’
Steve Martin exclaimed to the audience.
Penelope Cruz, look-
ing as gorgeous as
ever, presented the
first major award of
the ceremony - Best
Supporting Actor -
to Christoph Waltz
for his brilliant
performance in In-
glourious Basterds.
Unfortunately, Tar-
rantino’s WWII set
revenge fantasy
failed to pick up
any other accolades
it might have justly
deserved.
The incredibly adorable Zoe Saldana
came on stage with Bafta winning and
Oscar nominated British actress Carey
Mulligan to present an award. Best Origi-
nal Screenplay went to The Hurt Locker
and Best Foreign Film to The Secret in
Their Eyes.
Mo’Nique took the second
Best Supporting Acting
statuette for her intense per-
formance in Precious. Pre-
cious also took home the
Adapted Screenplay
award as well. We
then witnessed
a bizarre dance
sequence set
against the mu-
sic of the five
films nominated for
best score which
eventually went to
Up.
Before the important awards were re-
vealed we had the annual ‘in memoriam
‘ slideshow. Fariah Fawcett, one of the
original Charlie’s Angels was contro-
versially left out whereas Michael
Jackson was unusually included
as he is a musician and not an
actor. Long overdue an Oscar, Jeff
Bridges was ecstatic in receiving his
Best Actor award for his tender por-
trayal of a down and out singer in
Crazy Heart. Sandra Bullock then took
to the stage to receive her statuette for
her first Oscar nomination and win for
Best Actress. She also received a Razzie
Award for worst actress.
What was
fashionable
in 1961?
Smoking
J.F.K
Elvis
As the ceremony drew
to a close and the clock
ticked towards 5am in
England, the anticipa-
tion for the last two
awards - Best Direc-
tor and Best Picture
- rose to a climax. This
was not James Cam-
eron’s night and Kath-
ryn Bigelow took two
Oscars home for her
intense Iraq set war
drama The Hurt Locker
which won 6 awards in
total.
