While this season has been frustating, there
have been many positives for this ever
expanding club. With intentions to develop
further and enter into BUCS next season
we have much to look forward to. Varsity is
always an occasion that we look forward to,
with ICSM getting closer to that elusive ‘W’.
Hopefully this is the year. Nevertheless we
will go out, play hard and enjoy the game.

This year has been very successful so far,
and I am very pleased with both the new
players who have joined the team, and the
improved sense of team and club spirit. We
are near the top of both our BUCS and ULU
leagues, as well as finishing runners up in the
ULU Challenge Cup. As one of the youngest
teams in either league, these results are very
promising, and we are returning nearly all
of our players next year, when we aim to
become the first Imperial basketball team
to win both our BUCS and ULU leagues.
In terms of Varsity, I would like to encourage
as many Imperial students to come and
watch what are undoubtedly the best
athletes currently enrolled at Imperial. The
Medics do not have a very strong team, and
so we hope to use the game as a showcase
for our athleticism, solid team-play and
enthusiasm for the game.

Last year we entered Varsity unsure about
how the game would fare following the
previous year’s embarrassment of a three-
fold defeat. However a smaller deficit last
year gives us hope for this year’s game. The
historically uneven game turned out to be
a well contested and more importantly
boosted the team’s confidence. The team
has welcomed many new recruits who have
become critical players thanks to coach
Hannah Barrett. The team has worked hard
all year with determination and a constant
level of enthusiasm which has reflected well
this season. Although league performances
were tough due to the amalgamation of the
two divisions, semi-finalists in the ULU cup
is an achievement all players are extremely
proud of. We are rapidly becoming
contenders and hope that Varsity this year
will allow us to showcase our new talent and
hopefully take the win!
Anita Ponnuthurai ICSM 1st Team Captain
After a realtively poor 08/09 season,
ICUAFC 1st XI have built a new squad which
has achieved a lot this season. It took a
while for the squad to settle and find its feet
but it is now widely suggested amongst its
opposition that at this stage of the season
the 1st XI have developed to be amongst the
best university football teams in London.
After ruining the unbeaten records of
SOAS and UCL, two of ULU’s top three
teams, Imperial have in hindsight rued their
lackluster performances against the weaker
teams in the league. With consistency
the major area to work on for next year,
Imperial will be looking to improve on their
satisfactory 3rd place in BUCS 3A.
The major success this year has been in the
ULU Challenge Cup. A mouthwatering tie
against League leaders LSE on 21 March will
be the final game for Imperial to achieve
some silverware this season.
This year’s Varsity is predicted to be a close
affair after a marked improvement in the
Medicals squad. Hopefully, Imperial will use
their strength, speed & skill to overcome a
disciplined and physical Medicals squad.

This season has seen the ICSMFC 1st team
battle to the very end. Throughout the
entire season the 1st team have shown that
having enough heart and desire can earn
you due respect on the football pitch. The
season started slowly when many of the
team’s more experienced players were
away on their elective periods. However, a
young and boisterous team came away with
some commendable wins against tough
opposition, improving with very game. The
second half of the season was when the
team really got into its stride with a well
earnt 6 game unbeaten run. Courageous
performances against teams in higher
leagues showed we could compete at that
level and spurred the team on further. With
a previous game against IC 1st team narrowly
ending in defeat on penalties Varsity is set to
be a close contest this year.

Overall we’ve had a successful season
this year. Despite struggling with a few
tough ULU league matches, we won all our
matches in our division of the BUCS league.
We hope to continue with a win in the
upcoming Varsity match.
