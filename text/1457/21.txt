Drunken-Mate Photo Of The Week
Drunks are famous for the double-standard. Take this guy, for example.
Haagen Dazs for a snack-cum-hat and tea-towels and kitchen chairs for a bed.
Got a picture
of your mate
being an
absolute waste
of oxygen?
Well, get your
camera out
and email your
drunken mates
to catnip.

Your Craziest RAG
Moments
Last year, I swam in the Serpentine. Was in bed later that week
with Typhoid. Maybe the two were connected?
Second Year
We chased after Boris Johnson. He shook my hand!
First Year Chemist
I was flash-mobbed by 6am underground commuters laden
with loose change. I saw Death!!
Third Year Medic
What is that mysterious staind? Red wine? Ketchup? Blood?! All are possible at
black-tie event. Less easily explainable is the shopping trolley from Sainsburys.
Aunty McPickle loves a morning coffee, but it’s got to be fresh... real fresh.
Dear Aunty Mcpickle,
I recently caught my mum making a
tasty frappe for breakfast. The only
thing is we have no milk and she’s
been nipple dribbling lately. Am I to
think the worst?
Katherine Thompson
Dear Katherine,
All I can suggest is that you sample
the beverage before you speculate it’s
source. If it is mammary derived, it
should be distantly familiar and have
that tangy discharge after taste. I sug-
gest you recommend your mum sees a
doctor if does turn out to be her own
produce.

Dear Aunty Mcpickle,
I seem to have contracted several
STD’s from a certain physics lab
bench I dry humped last week. I
have thus received several drugs to
clear it up. On the day of collection,
I stashed them away in a “man” bag
and headed for the union. A medic
bartender then found the bag and
announced by Chlamydia shame.
Everyone knows and the worst thing
is I didn’t even get them back. Will
my shame ever die?
Seamus Siddy
Dear Seamus,
You have to start getting your life
sorted out. Why would you carry such
potential embarrassment to the union?
Learn your lesson and go back to the
doctors and consider adding physciat-
ric medication this time.

Dear Aunty Mcpickle,
I was on a recent night out with a lot
of friends and a couple of boys I was
trying to impress. I ended up drink-
ing a lot and squatting in the corner
of the club. A nearby friend helped
me up, but on this sudden elevation I
was sick all over my naked boob. The
photos are on facebook. How do I
ever feel attractive again?
Much love,
Pip Slutens
Dear Pip,
Well…. Pretend it didn’t happen and
ease off the booze for a bit. Also take
loads of drunken photos of your friends
to balance things out for a while.
