Heaven
L
ady Madonna, children at
your feet. For me, Abbey
Road Studios is the Lady
Madonna of the music in-
dustry, not only because,
grown from it, was the immortal piano
riff that The Beatles recorded there,
but also because it’s the house piano
available, for the fortunate enough
to venture inside, to let their musical
minds race on the same black and white
keys that graced the touch of Lennon
and McCartney some 40 years earlier.
This phenomenon is both historically
significant, and in current use, blessing
every pianist with its stories, which is
exactly the way things should be.
There is a case to be made for pre-
serving this marvellous creation be-
hind glass frames and velvet rope so
that what has occurred within those
four walls is remembered forever.
However, it is not a marvellous build-
ing, it’s a relatively average building for
its surroundings in St. John’s Wood.
What has made it the beautiful land-
mark that it is are the things that have
happened within. As I see it, there is
the potential for far more incredible
music to come out of what has become
known as Abbey Road, and surely, the
best way to have its history remem-
bered forever would be to have history
continually being made there.
Although it’s best known for much of
The Beatles’ work, it should be known,
as of the date that EMI was formed and
the studios became the centre of rock
music in 1958, musicians such as: Cliff
Richard, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Stevie
Wonder as well as everyone involved
in the recordings ‘Live From Abbey
Road Studios’, have been key in making
Abbey Road the legend that still turns
its cogs.
As a nation, it has to be said that
there is poor effort put in to cherish-
ing our musical heritage, if any at all.
The Hacienda in Manchester - gone,
the Astoria in London - gone. Cavern
Club in Liverpool - a carpark, the Mar-
quee Club in London, once the musi-
cal home of The Who - cleared for
restaurants and apartments. What has
this world come to? It may not be as
old as the Colosseum or as grand as the
Houses of Parliament, but in terms of
having a direct influence over a large
amount of people across the UK and
the world alike, Abbey Road wins.
Abbey Road was recently cast under
this shadow of uncertainty for its fu-
ture, like many before it. February of
2010 brought us the news that EMI had
placed the studios up for sale due to in-
creasing financial issues, causing huge
controversy over the protection of Ab-
bey Road Studios. When news of luxury
apartments and a chance that Andrew
Lloyd Webber might buy in surfaced,
there sprouted a sudden change of heart
by EMI. Deciding to keep the studios,
with a little help from its friends, Abbey
Road Studios will live on as an active
recording venue, waiting to pass on the
gifts that it has shared so many times
before, held within its four walls, to the
future of music.

AGE OF DENIAL
HUNGRY AUDIO
SINGLE
Now this I might actually listen to
again! In an age where apparently
everything needs to be shocking to
be worth listening to, this will ap-
pear plain and boring but I like it. No
surprises, no auditory pain just easy-
listening dreamy pop-rock. With you
is the track of the album!

SILENCE
ALBUM
With 20 members, at times this al-
bum is a little disjointed with so many
styles attempting to find an outlet.
Some amusing song titles, ‘As in Uffish
Thought’, compliment the very strange
sounds perfectly. QOTSA but much
weirder is my diagnosis, slightly folky
spaced out feel. - Emily Beech
BEACH HOUSE
TEEN DREAM
SUBPOP
ALBUM
It’s not often that you find a band who,
on their second album released a bet-
ter record than their first and who
then with their third album, blow all
their previous efforts out of the water.
But then it’s not often that you find a
band like Beach House who have so
rigorously defined their own sound
and then worked tirelessly to bring it
to perfection. Which is what ‘Teen
Dream’ is: perfection. It transports you
to a dreamy world of past loves and lost
childhood friends. Every song seam-
lessly plays as part of the whole record
but are simultaneously complete struc-
tures of their own. I could write col-
umns and columns about this album,
it’s the best record that I’ve heard in a
long, long time. - Kadhim Shubber
Whiney indie drawl is a fair descrip-
tion. An introduction by Mr Churchill
does not improve my opinion of them.
Despite this lots of people will like
them; Zane Lowe named it the ‘Hot-
test Record in the World Today’. My
love for Zane Lowe is not enough to
convince me....Next!

ALBUM
Popular with MTV and previously at
number 1 in the chart, Jason Derülo is
producing music for the masses who
apparently like it! It is catchy as sh*t and
will have the club singing along to every
track. In fairness he is talented enough
to create songs that will have half the
population pinning him to their walls
while the other half wish they had never
heard the f*cking song. - Emily Beech
E
xams are only about 6
weeks away and so I was
seriously considering stay-
ing at home on the night
the Local Natives wowed
Heaven nightclub. Instead, I grabbed
my coat and leapt out of my front
door and forgot revision in a flourish
of academic irresponsibility. My ser-
endipitous reward? The musical joy
of Peggy who happened to be sup-
porting that evening.
I felt vaguely uncomfortable be-
cause it’s probably about time that
Peggy Sue’s musical career finally
took flight and moved firmly out of
the realm of lowly support acts. If
you didn’t already know, Peggy Sue
are 2 girls and a chap who play drum-
heavy, accordion-infused folk music
and they play it damn well.
But they were only the tantalizing
appetizer so let’s zoom quickly on to
the main dish. The Local Natives are
an L.A. band with a fantastic debut
album called “Gorilla Manor”, who
have been compared with Fleet Fox-
es; which is about right; take Fleet
Foxes out of the woods and throw
them on to a sunny drive down to

the beach, and add in a load of toe-
tapping and hey presto, it’s The Lo-
cal Natives. But to be more serious,
the comparison with Fleet Foxes re-
ally comes from their use of multi-
layered vocals to create beautiful, en-
thralling harmonies. Fleet Foxes do
it with a very folk and country angle
whereas The Local Natives aim in an
indie direction.
Ultimately, the prevalence of these
combined vocals mean that the band
stand at the front of the stage four-
abreast (with the drummer languish-
ing unseen at the back) and belt out
their lyrics as one, with no one band
member taking the traditional role of
frontman; which isn’t so bad in my
opinion. The set-up gives the band
a very strong presence that comple-
ments their powerful sound well;
they physically fill your vision and
their sound envelopes your ears.
But I’m not describing some loud
hardcore metal band or a DJ with the
bass turned up too high; the intrica-
cies and deft little turns that litter
their songs aren’t overwhelmed. In
addition, they move well between
their few upbeat tunes and their
moody, chilled out songs where they
excel. So in summary, they were
damn good, so good in fact that
even the stony-faced Hugh Crail
was compelled to whoop and cheer;
which is saying something very pow-
erful indeed.
