E-Ink not ready for prime time
Feroz Salam talks eReaders and how they’re a couple of years ahead of their time
O
ne thing that has been a
staple feature of science
fiction stories since the
late 50’s is the death of
printed books. If SF authors are to be
believed, books are eventually going to
be phased out in favour of eBooks, and
in the 21st century, major publishers
and content distributors seem to agree.
Both Barnes and Noble and Amazon
have been aggressively selling their
eBook readers, and even Apple’s iPad
was announced alongside a New York
Times Reader app to make the online
version of the paper resemble the real
thing much more closely. Yet apart
from relatively strong sales of Ama-
zon’s Kindle, the response to the con-
cept of eBooks has been lukewarm at
best. On one hand authors are deterred
by the thought of piracy eating away
at profit margins, while on the other,
readers don’t seem to be attracted to
the prospect of buying an expensive
device that has only one real function.
The price of your average eBook
reader in it’s current incarnation is
one reason why I don’t consider them
to be any more than a shiny toy for
early adopters. With the 6-inch Kindle
priced at a hefty £170, it’s not the sort
of thing you would pick up on a whim,
especially on a student budget. Even at
£170 you get little other than a reader.
Most books are priced at upwards of
£5, which means that a 20-book col-
lection on a reader would cost as much
as £270, a price which would probably
buy you upwards of 75 used books in
good condition, much more reading
than I do in an average year. Some
reader manufacturers have suggested
that the devices could also replace
printed textbooks, with the ability to
annotate text making for interactive
textbooks that hold all your notes. Yet
e-textbooks can cost as much as £50
each; more than already overpriced
paper textbooks. With the ability to
only open one book at once, you can’t
exactly spread your books out over a
table either.
The problem with true eBook read-
ers is that they are a few years ahead of
their time. Although the cost of buying
and using the Kindle or some similar
device is high, the fundamental prob-
lem doesn’t lie with pricing, but with
screen technology. The Kindle and its
brethren use a particular type of dis-
play, E-Ink, that’s not in use on many
other devices. The display technology
is designed to mimic the look of actual
print with high contrast and density,
reduced eye strain created by the need
for backlights and allowing for longer
reading sessions. The catch? The re-
fresh rate and lack of colour of current
generation E-Ink severely limits the
graphical capabilities of these devices,
making them useless for much more
than reading and light web browsing.
Amazon’s claim of ‘16 shades of grey’
sounds like something out of a tel-
evision advertisement from the 1940s.
Therefore, current eBook readers will
never be able to play a YouTube video
or render game graphics, making them
oddities at a time when most devices
are capable of handling a variety of me-
dia simultaneously.
Apple seem to think they have solved
this problem with the iPad. The LCD
screen can serve up any media you
require, while the screen is just the
right size for reading. Seeing potential
to own the market, Apple has made
a serious push into the eBook space,
launching an iBookstore similar to
iTunes, with works from most ma-
jor publishing houses featuring on its
shelves. Yet whether this gamble will
pay off is quite questionable. I’ve tried
reading eBooks on laptops for many
years now and I can’t stand reading
more than a few pages of text at a time.
I wouldn’t mind glancing through a
newspaper, but reading the entire Lord
of the Rings trilogy on an LCD screen
would probably blow my eyes out,
if my Computing degree doesn’t get
Look at you, peasant. With all your books and a laptop, oh how you live in the last century.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week in Tech has
flown by, but what have we got
to show for it?
Well, have you ever wished
you could fly? Not in a plane I
mean, fly like Superman? Yeah,
I have too. Well I’m afraid
it’s impossi-
ble, but
you can
have
the
next
best
thing, the
Martin jet-
pack. The
jetpack in
question is
destined to be the first com-
mercially available later this
year, and at $86000 it’s not
even as much as a fully spec-
ced Lambo. This personal fly-
ing marvel is powered by a 2L
V4 two-stroke engine spinning
two carbon-kevlar composite
rotors, running on bog stand-
ard petrol with a flight time of
30 minutes. Now if that doesn’t
beat the pants off your mate’s
crappy sports car, I don’t know
what will.
You could be forgiven for
thinking the OO HD wireless
projector, crappy name I
know, was some
sort of
spaceship,
perhaps
even something
out of War of the Worlds.
Packing 1080p projection, an
SSD, WiFi, Li-ion battery and
internal decoders, this con-
cept could be the all-in-one
media sensation that you’ve
been looking for. Mind you, if
it ever materialises into the real
world, don’t expect it to come
cheap. Guess it’s the price you
pay for function and beauty.
Sony’s been busy this week
building up the HD content
on its Playstation Network
with the announcement of all
six major movie studios com-
ing on board. 20th Century
Fox, Walt Disney,
Paramount,
Universal,
Warner Bros.
and Sony’s own Sony
Pictures Entertain-
ment have clubbed
together to make
a massive 19 HD
movies available
for rent or to buy.
OK, I might be
exaggerating a bit,
but it’s a step in the
right direction for all those
wielding a PS3 right? Currently
only available in the US, Sony’s
pushing for a UK, France, Ger-
many and Spain release soon.
More car news this week
from the Geneva Motor Show.
Are you an Aston Martin DBS
owner, who just wishes he had a
smaller Aston for the city run-
around? Well for the princely
sum of around £30,000 you can
have the Aston Martin Cyg-
net. Packed with
features like a
fancy iPod
dock, leath-
er interior
and lots
of chrome
throughout,
the Toyota IQ
based Cygnet is your way of
giving the finger to all those
Mini drivers who think they’re
the dogs. Think I’ll just stick to
the DBS thanks.
Having shown the world the
incredible faster-than-a-Car-
rera-GT 918 Spyder
Hybrid concept,
which we saw last
week, Porsche
also rolled out
the insane look-
ing 911 GT3-R Hybrid con-
cept. Porsche has ditched the
battery for a flywheel, which is
spun up to 40,000 rpm by the
car decelerating. A generator
turned by the flywheel then
powers a pair of 60kW electric
motors attached to the front
wheels. The system incorpo-
rates a boost button like that
found in the F1 KERS system,
adding 160bhp for up to 8
seconds. Finally, a real turbo
boost!

A
nother week’s flown by and
bam, we’re into the middle
of March. This week saw
a lot of car tech attention
due to the Geneva Motor Show that’s
been going on. Most of the technol-
ogy on show has been based around
traditional hybrid cars, admittedly not
from traditional hybrid manufactur-
ers. Who’d have thought when Toyota
first launched the Prius that the likes of
Porsche and Ferrari would follow suit
with high performance hybrids? Of
course those in the know realise that
having an electric motor is far from a
disadvantage for potential sports cars,
with maximum torque right from the
get-go and carried through the entire
range of acceleration. The problem lies
in supplying the electric motor with
enough power for any decent range.
This is why most hybrids currently
run a conventional combustion engine
with an electric motor tacked on for
low speed, short range driving. Cars
like the new plugin Prius drive with
the electric motor up to about 23km
with a maximum electric-only speed of
100kph. Once the battery is depleted,
or the speed you’re demanding from
the car is greater than 100kph, then the
petrol motor kicks in to power the car
and recharge the battery.
This means that you haven’t removed
the petrol problem. Of course you can
use biofuel or some ethanol based fu-
els, but it’s still a carbon emitting fuel
you have to use. Hybrids are going
to be forced into the mainstream for
larger engine cars in the next couple of
years once the EU’s emissions regula-
tions kick in. But hybrid cars are hold-
ing back development of true, non-fuel
dependent solutions. A poor stop gap
in the progression of the humble car.
there first.
Will eBook readers eventually catch
on? Almost certainly, as they should.
The concept of a centralised book-
store that can distribute books over
the Internet 24/7 without running
out of stock is great. eBooks will last
for longer and, as Project Gutenberg
has proved, could well turn out to be
a great way of preserving books for fu-
ture generations. Yet before they can
achieve ubiquity, the technologies they
are based on have to improve drasti-
cally. E-Ink needs to become more
versatile or be replaced with another
technology, and varying book formats
shouldn’t mean that you are locked to
a manufacturer for life, just because
you started collecting books on one of
their devices. Realistically, it will take
at least a few more years before you see
them on the bus home. If you hold off
buying them now you’ll probably get a
much more mature and versatile de-
vice with a much smaller price tag.
