The mixed team (actually a mix of IC and
Medic players) has had yet another storming
season so far. An undefeated season so far
with only a draw to blemish the record, the
team won the ULU Challenge Cup for the 4th
year in a row at the weekend. With only two
league matches remaining we’re aiming to
finish on top of the ULU league for the second
year running. Varsity creates a slight paradox
of ‘playing ourselves’, which typically means
a more relaxed/beer filled match than other
sports may face. Medics
will be hoping that a much
smaller IC team doesn’t
once again walk all over
them.

Over the last season we have acquired a
lot of new player’s, which has been vital in
enabling us to carry on producing a full team.
Many of these player’s have never picked up
a rugby ball before in their life and this meant
that we have been unable to produce many
wins this season. However, with the end of
the season drawing in there are a few more
seven’s matches coming up. This gives us the
opportunity to make up for the losses, as
we have the advantage in this field with the
majority of our team being on the small side
but faster as a result.
Varsity for us as a team will be different
to many other sports as we normally play
alongside one another, medics and non-
medics, making it difficult to play aggressively
against players whom we consider to be both
friends and team mates. However, I hope that
this first experience of sevens for the season
will set most of the newbie’s up with the
experience for future matches.

This season has been very successful for IC
squash. Having been promoted into the top
tier of BUCS competition last year, we’ve
beaten the likes of Bristol, Loughborough,
Leeds Met. and Birmingham 1st teams.
We ended up finishing 3rd in the league
and therefore seeded 3rd for the cup. We
eased through the first round of the cup
with a 5-0 victory over UCL. Next up was
Loughborough in the quarters who were
hungry for revenge after our narrow victory
in the league. We managed to win the best-
of-5 match with Peter Marshall winning the
decider. This resulted in qualification the
semi finals, with both the semi final and final
to be played on the weekend of the 13/14th
March.
I predict IC will be too strong for ICSM if they
put out a full team. This said, I think ICSM will
be competitive in the 1st team match with
two players from the regular IC 1st team.

The season started off with high hopes (a
bit too high on my part) and a lot of positive
attitude! My aim was to get promoted.
Wishful thinking. We finished 4th in the
table.
Apart from several bruises and aching
legs, the season left with us some great
memories: amazing coaching sessions
from our coach Harry Beeston; lessons in
sportsmanship and most of all team spirit at
its highest.
This 2010, we aim to put up a great fight
against the strong IC team. Luckily for us,
we have pinched a few of their players.
These are the medics at heart and have
decided to back the ICSM team (to
victory?). With home turf advantage
however, it’s anyone’s game. But we hope
it’s ours!

This year has been a pretty successful one
for the IC Men’s 2nd team. In the ULU cup
competition we made it to the semi-final,
losing out in a close match with the Royal
Holloway 1st team. In the ULU league we are
currently sitting in 2nd place, with only our
1st team ahead. With only one game to go
hopefully we can make it an IC one/two. In
BUCS we were promoted last year up to the
South East division 1 putting us in a tough
league up against a number of 1st teams from
other universities. However, we have finished
in 3rd place which is an excellent result for us.
In Varsity this year we’ll be hoping to beat
the medics in style… without loosing a single
game!?

Unlike the long standing 1st team, The ICSM
squash 2nd team is a newly created and
well oiled machine dedicated to a single
goal - Varsity. The team has been gathered
from accross ICSMSC and lead by Will
Bermingham. Our reason d’etre is simple - a
respectable and hopefully entertaining
Varsity performance, adding a little je ne
sais quoi to the term “underdog”
