Imperial field trip to grand final
The fifteen teams which made it
through to the regional semi-finals of
the BP Ultimate Field Trip challenge
(reported in felix earlier) have been re-
duced to five for the Grand Final, two
of which are comprised of Imperial
students.
Hot Carbon (Tom Wesby, Carmen
Pinto-Ward, Miriam Wright) and
Meltdown (Lizzie Riley, Chris Hunter,
Ben Said) are the two teams of second
year IC students in the Grand Final.
Upon learning they were through, Hot
Carbon commented they “feel a real
sense of achievement and fulfilment’’
and that “it’ll be exciting to see the re-

Meltdown remarked that as second
years, they were ‘’honoured to have
been taken seriously by experts in the
field and would love to see [their] idea
take off’’.
They were thrilled to have got so far
and to have “gained valuable research
and presentation skills’’ by undertak-
ing the project.
The grand final, to be held on the
12th of April in South Kensington and
hosted by John Humphrys, will see the
teams presenting their solutions, dem-
onstrating their videos and being sub-
jected to a live Q&A session.
The panel will include BP and in-
dustry carbon reduction experts. felix
wishes the IC teams the best of luck!

Are we saying ‘bye bye Wye’?
Dr Terence Kealey, Vice Chancellor
of the University of Buckingham, ap-
proached Imperial with a proposal to
reactivate the Wye Campus, which has
been inactive since teaching ceased in
2009.
Live! (live.cgcu.net) reported that Dr
Kealey was interested in setting up a
new private University and has since
mentioned using the Wye Campus as
a potential site. Should plans move
ahead, the resulting University would
be an extension of the University of
Buckingham, which is currently the
only privately funded University in the
UK. The Headmasters’ and Headmis-
tresses’ Conference and schools such
as St Paul’s and Eton are deliberating
over the plans for development.
The plan was described by High
Master of St Paul’s, Martin Stephen, as
an “embryonic version of Harvard and
Yale’’, stating his enthusiasm to sup-
port the project should it be financially
suitable. Live! reporters approached
Dr Kealey, who explained: “a group of
Wye alumni have approached me to
ask if Buckingham would be interested
in helping develop the Wye campus. I
therefore wrote to Sir Keith asking if
we could discuss this. He has agreed to
meet me shortly, and his correspond-
ence has been unfailingly courteous
which, in the face of the press cover-
age, I very much appreciated.’’
Statistics from The Independent
show that the general cost of setting
up a University is £200 million, but
the plans to extend the University of
Buckingham with the Wye Campus
suggest a cost of only £25 million.
The tuition fees are proposed to be
around £10,000, £2000 higher than
Buckingham’s annual fees, suggesting
that the Wye Campus will be an ‘’elite’’
extension.
Plans, however, are not yet final, and
Dr Kealey was reported to have told
Live! that “the Wye campus belongs
to Imperial and until I have spoken to
Sir Keith and ascertained Imperial’s
plans for developing its own property
it would be impertinent of me to say
anything more.’’
