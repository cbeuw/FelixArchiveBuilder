I
’ve just taken a table in my local
Starbucks to find a half-eaten
shortbread and a mostly-full
mug of brown slop left on the
table like an offering to the god
of feckless, uncaring shits. There’s
about four pounds worth of food and
drink on the table, and I’m going to
throw it away. The couple who were
sitting here before me were planning
some grand trip out to Vietnam, talk-
ing about how badly they needed the
break and how it would do them good.
I’m feeling quite tired of people today.
Moreso than usual, I mean.
It’s no secret – insofar as a man who
writes behind a pen name every week
can have things that aren’t secrets –
that I dislike people with more money
than sense. I find it hard to relate to
people who come to one of the finest
scientific institutions on the planet
merely because they want a pent-
house flat and a Mercedes one day. I
can relate to people wanting more of
things, or a good life for themselves,
but over time it becomes more and
more obvious to me that most people
are here for one thing and one thing
only – themselves.
I read the superb and entertaining
Logicomix a few months back - it’s a
comic book charting the life of Ber-
trand Russell, his forays into math-
ematics and logic, as well as provid-
ing a discussion about scientists and
the passion that drives them. Almost
every academic that I’ve met at Impe-
rial, at PhD level or higher, has some
equivalent of that drive within them.
I can’t say I do all the time. That’s
just not true. Only the other day I was
carving “NEWTON IS A BASTARD”
on my arm with a rusty biro, and I can
frequently be seen outside the Science
Museum holding a plank of wood with
a nail in it. I don’t like science all the
time.
But I can’t imagine coming here and
not really caring for it at all. I can’t
imagine waking up every day, walking
through the corridors of Imperial and
not feeling like you’re part of some-
thing that’s more than a payroll system.
Yet I’m amazed at how many people
do just that – how many people who,
upon graduating, will go straight into
a job in consultancy, or finance, or trot
over to a business school somewhere
else in the city. I know people who
will graduate and enter a job earning
three times what a PhD student earns.
They’ll walk into Starbucks, order a
load of food even though they don’t
feel hungry, and plan ways to excrete
all the money that pads out their body
instead of a soul.
Long-term readers might remember
the death of my grandfather a while
back. In the time since then, my father
has followed suit into the grave. The
old man was an interesting guy. He
had one GCSE, and did the same job
for all forty years of his working life.
He drove me through my time at Im-
perial with constant encouragement,
inquisitiveness and passion. Despite
having no contact with any form of
science since he was a teenager, he felt
a sense of pride when I spoke to him
about what I did. He saw Imperial as
I do – as a place where people go to
do something more than nine-to-five.
Whilst writing this, a few of the
more cretinous students from my
course have staggered in, ordered the
manliest coffees they could think of,
and are sitting loudly sharing stories
about interviews and contacts and
their glorious futures. I can think of
at least four or five passionate, intel-
ligent students who have been thrown
out on the street in the last twelve
months because they couldn’t find the
money to continue their studies. The
testosterone party being thrown just
a few tables away from me will col-
lectively earn more money in the first
few years of their working lives than
those students will throughout their
entire existence.
This column is supposed to enter-
tain you. I try to summon up as much
bile and venom as I can every week
in the hope that I’ll make my analo-
gies offensive enough to raise a smile
when you’re sitting in the JCR. But
some weeks the bile rises up a bit too
far and I catch myself in it too. When
they got the blues in the fifties, they’d
crack out a harmonica or something
twee like that. I think I might visit
Skempton and knock up a few smoke-
bombs for next week’s Goldman talks
instead.

S
o we save £69 a month by not
taking the tube. We’re always
five minutes late, our hair is
always poking in strange di-
rections, and we wear neon
jackets when there isn’t a Klaxon in
sight. The rain doesn’t scare us; we just
carry a plastic bag and a spare pair of
socks. And, oh, don’t sit there; I need
that seat for my helmet. Half term is
no longer a crush in South Kensington
tube but a clear road, we get excited
by gears and merino wool and the
boys can wear leggings without being
laughed at.
As I exited Hyde Park last week,
laughing at the queue of four-by-fours
trying to do the same thing but with
infinitely less style and a huge carbon
footprint, I felt pretty good. I wasn’t
burning fossil fuels, I hadn’t had to sit
next to someone eating an Egg Mc-
Muffin, and in minutes I was going
to be safely inside Imperial. My poor
bicycle was going to be left to face the
elements whilst I dried off and carried
on with the day, terrified of the win-
dow and the clouds outside.
I saw the police car before I ran the
‘red’. Sure, it was a traffic signal, one
that I chose to fail to comply with. But
I made it! I was on Exhibition Road,
singing ‘You Got The Love’ (this is the
only line I know) and I was going to
be early for labs. Oh no, the car be-
hind me is next to me. What a … “Errr,
could you just pull over miss”. Are..
you..joking? It was raining badly now,
and although I was only a road away
from essentially a sauna (to my runny
nosed imagination at least) I felt like I
was miles away. Actually, I thought we
were going to go down to the station.
Terrified, I explained my case. I
was trying to avoid the cars. I was
trying to keep everyone safe, me, the
drivers, the dog walkers, the horse
riders. No, I didn’t see the other cy-
clists waiting. No, I didn’t catch the
BBC expose that morning on the
lycra louts ruining our capital. I was
putting on an anorak and tucking my
thermals into my waterproof trou-
sers, sorry.
What a fine error that was. He took
my Imperial ID card out of my ruck-
sack cover for me, my skiing gloves
having the dual features of making me
look like a hit man and radically re-
ducing the use of my fingers. He took
my address (every single respectable
adult I’ve told since has said I should
have lied) and left me in the gutter, to
get covered with the grime of SW7
and a nice pair of waterlogged socks. I
watched him pull away, £30 better off,
staring at his sat nav, on the look out
for his next prey. He probably has us
all tagged.
It was a very slow journey home.
