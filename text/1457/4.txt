Allegations of candidate misconduct raised
Rumours have been circulating this
week about one of the candidates in
the Union elections, Andrew Brom-
field, after an anonymous email was
sent to editors of Imperial student
media, supposedly from a member
of the Union’s casual staff. The self-
styled ‘mole’ claimed to represent the
majority of Union casual staff when
they said they felt it “would be an
outrage if Andrew Bromfield were to
win the election”. Bromfield is one of
two candidates running for the role of
Deputy President – Finance & Serv-
ices which entails responsibility for
day to day financial administration,
budgetary queries, collating student
feedback and coordinating the Sum-
mer Ball.
Although the message was entirely
anonymous and the claims that Bro-
mfield was “continually... abusive and
aggressive” were entirely unsubstan-
tiated, a report was also leaked of an
incident in which Andrew Bromfield
was ejected from the Union premis-
es last term, for being verbally and
physically abusive. The incident oc-
curred in November last year just
after midnight, when Bromfield was
seen to strike another man in Da
Vinci’s. When asked to leave, Brom-
field refused several times and was
eventually physically removed. While

pewter tankard in order to retrieve his

Casual staff at the Union are integral to running events nearly every night
ID card, he ran back inside and was
once more carried out while he tried
to punch and kick the staff.
Two Senior Union stewards provid-
ed statements on the case but these
were later simultaneously withdrawn,
although they did confirm that Bro-
mfield had been involved in an ‘inci-
dent’. Bromfield has responded to the
email and the leaking of the report
and claims that parts of the report are
fictitious and written vaguely so as to
imply the worst about his behaviour.
He concedes that the bar staff “were
angry with [his] lack of cooperation
that evening” but denies that the in-
cident was as portrayed. He points
out that although he struggled against
being carried ‘unceremoniously’ out
of the Quad, at no point did he try to
cause physical harm to staff, and the
verbal abuse cited was limited to call-
ing one steward ‘idiot’, for which he
has since apologised. Bromfield also
pointed out that one member of staff
that night was opposing candidate
Ravi Pall, although he did not accuse
his fellow candidate of underhand
tactics. (For the record, this report
has not been influenced by Pall’s in-
volvement with felix.)
Further rumours have been spread-
ing about two other candidates run-
ning separately who, it is alleged, stole
wine from a Cheese & Wine evening
organised by Imperial College Cheese
Society on March 5th last year. Live!
(live.cgcu.net) reported this week
that each of the two walked into the

Barely anyone turns up to new format Hustings
Hustings were largely unsuccessful
this week as the Union tried to ramp
up election-fever. Voting opened this
past Tuesday and this coincided with
the poorly attended second round of
Hustings held at the Southside Social
Space.
The first round of Hustings took
place at 6.30pm Thursday 5th of
March in da Vinci’s bar; this venue
has traditionally been host to the sec-
ond round of the election’s Hustings in
previous years. Hustings are public fo-
rums where all the candidates running
in the election have the opportunity to
present themselves and their campaign
to the adoring public.
The newly-formatted second round
of Hustings took place this past Tues-
day (9th March) to an audience largely
made-up of campaign teams and not
the Freshers which the Union had tar-
geted. It is particularly embarrassing
for the Union as they had told candi-
dates to remove Hustings details, such
as time and date, from their campaign
material because they feared attend-
ance at Southside Social Space would
go beyond a recommended 120 capac-
ity. This was aptly pointed out, albeit
with a hint of sarcasm, by Presidential
hopeful Alex Kendall after the ques-
tion: ‘What would you do to improve
Hustings?’

Opposing candidate Chris Darby
refused to point the blame at the stu-
dents for the poor turn-out.
“People have been asking me all week
when they can come to hustings so I
don’t think they really are apathetic. I
don’t think there is that much apathy,
people did genuinely want to be here,”
he reckoned in response to a ques-
tion that enquired into the candidate’s
thoughts on general student apathy at
Imperial.
The event was restricted to residents
of Southside, Eastside, Garden and
Weeks halls but failed to attract num-
bers into double figures.
The Returning Officers’ red faces
started to complement the lucidly
bright pink T-shirts the current sabbat-
ical team were wearing on the evening.
Even though the proceedings were de-
layed and the Southside Social Space
seemed relatively occupied first year
audience numbers peaked at around
five midway through the evening.
Another Presidential candidate,
Serge Vasylechko, saw the lack of ad-
vertising and the esoteric nature of the
Union as the main problems, and sug-
gested further reformatting of the elec-
tion process as the solution.
“All this year’s candidates know each
other so not enough people are getting
involved. We need better advertise-
ment,” he said. “I’d hold a proper de-
bate in the Great Hall [for Hustings].”
Hustings in da Vinci’s last week was
Dan Wan
Dan Wan Editor-in-Chief the usual rowdy affair with heckling
throughout. However, Presidential
candidate Stan Tarasov described the
experience as “underwhelming” and
expected “banners and chanting”.
RON, Re-open Nominations can-
didate, stood strong throughout the
proceedings and poked plenty of holes
in candidates speeches and answers to
the audience’s questions.
It has been a tough week for those
involved in the Imperial College Un-
ion Elections with allegations of mis-
conduct by several candidates flying
around College.
felix also decided to retract state-
ments from last week’s issue after the
suggestion by Returning Officer John
James, though it is now the Union’s
turn to face the flak after something
went very wrong with their ‘fresh’ ap-
proach to election hustings this year.
Voting is still open, but closes at
23:59 Saturday the 13th of March.
Returning

event on the
night, but
attendance
at Southside
was extremely
overestimated
Fairtrade Fortnight event on separate
occasions during the evening without
paying and were seen to take bottles
of wine. These bottles were apparent-
ly later found in a Physics lecture the-
atre. It is claimed that both candidates
returned again later in the evening
and were verbally abusive, one was
also allegedly physically violent. Af-
ter security was called, the pair were
removed from the Huxley building.
If true, these allegations bring into
question the suitability of the candi-
dates for sabbatical positions.
Cheesesoc was unable to comment
on any rumours about the event ac-
cording to Union election rules, and
comments on the Live! website all
suggest that the story’s bias is the re-
sult of mudslinging by friends of op-
posing candidates.
Voting is still taking place online
for sabbatical positions until 11.59pm
Saturday, via the Union website (www.
imperialcollegeunion/elections).
