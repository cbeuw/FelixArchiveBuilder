Get your horoscopes while they’re still hot and tasty!
Unfortunately due to a shortage in funds this week the horoscopes were written by street urchins. Oh dear
Cancer
Perhaps if I make
another inappropriate
joke about having
cancer there will
wind up being a
really bad shot at my
footwear here. You know, on second thoughts
that was such a poor effort I should really make
a deliberate effort to avoid the whole subject
of cancer. Mmmm, I like unicorns, they’re sooo
pretty. And rainbows!
Virgo
Fridays are never
very good. Especially
when you’re broke
and hungry. But at
this point, having
not eaten for a
week, you reach breaking point. You begin
hallucinating that your lecturer is a chicken
drumstick. You run to the front of the lecture
hall, skewer him, and barbecue roast him.
Yummy.
Gemini
You are running
for DPFS but
accidently leave
your computer
on. You get fa-
cebook raped by
someone saying you embezzle money. You
wind up losing the election and the top it off
you are now under investigation by the CIA.
Well, you hope so. Otherwise there is just a
creepy man following you around...
Pisces
You go for
chlamydia testing at
the Southside Social
Space to get free
boxers where they
ask you to pee into
a cup; the twats from the health centre give
you a used cup and you contract cat aids and
die. Worse than that? They’ve run out of free
boxers and you get one of those crap yellow
t-shirts instead.
Leo
You’re looking for
accomodation for the
next academic year;
you happen to find
a place on Cromwell
road for a reasonable
price as the landlords say they’ll partition the shit
out of the flat for any number of people. Mass
orgies ensue; you contract cat aids and die. Worse
than that? You fail to pay your rent on time and
Mr. Razin cuts your hand off.
Aries
You have now
contracted such a
plethora of venereal
diseases that you can-
not physically have
sex any more because
your penis is so swollen. You go to the doctor and
they say they’re going to have to take it off. NO!
NO! Everything goes black. You wake up and
look down. They took off your penis and put on a
vagina instead. What the hell!?
Scorpio
Wow, you’re lucky!
Especially as you have
the same horoscope
as me, the mysteri-
ous horoscope writer.
This week you will find
yourself unexpectedly richer, you will also meet a
handsome man and pass all your exams. Honestly,
this will all happen. I consulted the stars you know,
they never lie. What you read here is the absolute
truth.
Libra
This week is looking
good for you. You find
£50 in a cash machine
in Koko. Unfortunately
the money belongs to a
Thai ladyboy who
hunts you down and rapes you. You contract
both Chlamydia and a rare breed of Thai cat
aids. Due to a recent death at the Health Centre
they no longer offer free testing, you never find
out and die.
Taurus
Perhaps prostitu-
tion is a good way
of earning a living.
Your sister’s friend
paid her way through
university that way.
You adorn yourself in your most slutty attire and
walk the streets in hope of earning a few bucks.
A man takes you back to his place, but promptly
kicks you out. “Thought you were a transexual
prostitute, but you’re clearly post-op..”
Capricorn
You consult a voodoo
man about a pimple
on your back. He tells
you it is the spirit of
someone whom you
have wronged and
you must go and make amends for what you
have done. The only person you wronged was
your ex-boyfriend, you cheated on him. You
explain the situation. He beats you with rotten
vegetables until you’re paralysed... ...Pint?
Aquarius
YAY! You’re broke.
Isn’t this lovely? Well
it was, until you
couldn’t afford food
anymore. Begging
is probably the best
solution. You sit on a street in Whitechapel
with your cap out. Unfortunately you drift off
whilst still sitting on the street. You realise
someone has run off with your money. You
commit suicide, you miserable twat!

Sagittarius
Her eyes are like
glistening diamonds in
her moon-like visage.
A curtain of lustrous
auburn hair cascades
down her shoulders.
How beautiful this perfect girl is, how you wish
that she could be yours. But alas, it is not to
be. For this beautiful girl you talk about is not
just any girl. This girl whom you love above all
others is your sister. Ew.
