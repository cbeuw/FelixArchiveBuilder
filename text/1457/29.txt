Nonolink 1,457
Winner: Nonogram - Flavia Tang. The astute among you also recognised this was the same
nonogram as last week and hence the slitherlink numbers were incorrect. This one’s been triple
verified! Please remember that solving and submitting the Nonogram half of this puzzle only is
acceptable: points are awarded separately.
How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.

Bridges 1,457
No Cryptic Crossword this week so here’s something different. (An idea borrowed from a ‘Guest
Puzzle’ we printed several issues ago. If you would like to have your puzzles printed in felix send
them to us at sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and if we like them we’ll print them!
How to play:
Connect all the ‘islands’ together by bridges running in direct lines, North, West, East and South only,
with no more than two bridges connecting any two distinct islands. Every island must have a total
number of bridges from it equal to the number on the island and bridges must not cross islands, one
another or lead to nowhere!

Late night footie tournament!
L
ast Saturday Ethos turned
into a battleground. A total
of 14 highly motivated teams
consisting of 5-8 players each
competed to become the first ever
RAG Late Night Footie Tournament
winner. Teams ranged from Futsal,
ERASUS and “The Playboys” to Sym-
phony Orchestra to name a few. The
tournament started with some strong
performances by The Playboys and
Airborne Rangers, a team consisting
of Imperial football players. The RAG
All-Stars managed to scrape together
a team consisting of 6 unfit, out-of-
shape committee members. Irrespec-
tive of this, RAG managed to progress
to the quarter finals by winning its only
two matches (we were quite lucky with
the draw to be honest)! A highlight
of the night definitely was Symphony
Orchestra’s respectable defeat of Air-
borne Rangers by 5-1.
Once the winners and runner-ups
were determined, the quarter finals
could be battled out. Some strong per-
formances saw The Playboys, ERAS-
MUS, Futsal and Airborne Rangers II
progress to the semis. A rather weak
performance by the ref, yours truly,
played a large role in ERASMUS’s win
against Symphony Orchestra. Irre-
spective of this, the semi-finals were
played and the final was determined:
ERASMUS vs. Futsal.
Even though ERASMUS had beaten
some strong opponents to get that
far, Futsal was definitely considered
the favourite. A very emotional final
ended in favour of ERASMUS by 2-1.
All the profits made will go to our four
main chosen charities (Broadway, Bar-
nardos, KCA and Children’s Trust).
Thanks to everyone for taking part
and let’s see if ERASMUS can defend
their title next year!
