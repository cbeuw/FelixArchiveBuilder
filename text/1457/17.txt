Tubelord get cosy at The Borderline
This is Tubelord fever as Katie Clemence tells us of their Borderline
gig and cracks Joe Prendergast like an egg in her refreshing interview
KC: I’m going to start the interview
on a serious note- what is your favour-
ite dinosaur?
JP: Um… got to be triceratops.
KC: Good choice. Right, so before
you decided to wanted to be a musician
and in a band, what was your ambition
in life?
JP: I never decided that, or I don’t
think it’s happening… my ambi-
tion is, um (long pause) to not… be a
bricklayer?
KC: That should be fairly easy then?
JP: You say that, but it seems to be the
easiest route to go down
KC: Well, I’ll be a civil engineer, so I’ll
know whether or not you achieve that!
JP: I’m fine with you bossing me
around and telling me how to lay
bricks!
KC: Okay. So what would you say is
your role in the band aside from the in-
strument you play?
JP: Well, Dave (drummer) has this
thing of being really regimental about
everything, and he says we’re ‘directors
of the company’- the band company,
that is. So he says I’m artistic director
and I just go with that. Oh, and I’m the
abrasive person, I suppose. With Dave.
KC: Two abrasive people- that’s a
hell of a lot of abrasion! For the folk at
Imperial who maybe haven’t heard you
I
t was a blustery Monday evening
when I went to see Tubelord.
You may not have heard their
music, but murmurs about this
band are spreading, and the ru-
mours are all good. Needless to say,
the gig had a lot to prove.
It turned out we weren’t on the
guestlist- a good start to any night.
Fortunately, a combination of good
looks and charisma allowed us to blag
our way in for free. The venue, the
Borderline, felt like a good place to
be even as we entered. The room was
buzzing with excited energy, and one
of the support bands, Tall Ships, were
already playing. Grabbing a drink, we
were treated to the second half of their
set. Due to the shape of the room, the
gig felt very intimate, and Tall Ships
played on this by talking directly to the
audience, interacting and making eve-
ryone feel involved. Their music was
dreamy and synthy (admittedly like a
lot of new bands) but the set was also
good to watch, with the instrumental-
ists frequently swapping- playing each
others’ instruments and surprising us.
I think the nicest thing about watching
this band was that everybody seemed
to know the words to the songs, many
of which were chantlike and easy to
sing along to. The music encouraged
an intimacy within the audience, who
were a lot friendlier than your stand-
ard gig attendees.
So Many Dynamos were the next
support band, all the way from St
Louis, Missouri. I didn’t warm to them
as much as to Tall Ships, partly be-
cause their cyclic, thrumming, dance
style music and the singer’s accent re-
minded me of when I used to listen to
We Are Scientists, who used the same
kind of repetitive song formats in their
music. On the plus side, the songs
sounded very polished, even as a live
performance- also I was very, very
pleased when I realised this band’s
name was a palindrome. I hope you
are too, after you read this and look
back at their name to check I’m telling
the truth.
So, on to the main event. Tubelord
opened the set with the first track
from their album, starting with a mes-
merising chant which then explodes
into a frenzy of post-hardcore guitar.
It was a good start because everybody
knew the breakdown was coming and
the excitement was tangible- I’m pret-
ty sure some of the more bulky males
were drooling with the thirst for mosh.
This song was a good opener- it
prepared the audience for the nature
of Tubelord’s music, which is quick-
changing and unpredictable, keeping
us on our toes and anticipating what
was to come next. Tubelord built on
the intimacy created by the support
bands- I was particularly captivated
by a chant-like sequence during the
song, which had me wishing I knew
the words. The set continued in this
whirlwind fashion and pretty much
everyone was enjoying themselves,
especially the band. Particularly no-
table was lead guitar/singer Joe Pren-
dergrast’s dancing. I’ll call it a cross
between squat thrusts and doing the
twist- he got really into it during the
more impassioned guitar solos.
One thing that was a bit of a shame
about Tubelord’s gig was that it was
impossible to dance along to un-
less you knew the songs really well.
You can tell that they have obtained
large amounts of joy from the sheer
obscurity of the time signatures in
their songs- you can’t simply dance
in a 1,2,3,4 fashion and, to the ear of
a dance music fan, the songs might
sound slightly awkward. That’s per-
fectly okay though, because this music
is made to be listened to and appreci-
ated for its musical value, and for me
that overshadowed the fact that I was
bobbing around erratically in an at-
tempt to dance.
The standout moments from the
gig were when they played Night of
Pencils (check it out), and the song
Cows to the east, Cities to the West, a
quiet ballad amongst their many fast-
paced songs, with brilliant use of the
glockenspiel.
Overall the gig was really enjoyable-
The support bands were above aver-
age, I got to go backstage, and I got to
see Tubelord, who are now one of my
favourite new bands.
Katie Clemence catches Joe Prendergast, lead guitar and vocalist from post-hardcore math rock band
Tubelord, for a sneaky interview one fine Monday evening in a dim alleyway
before, how would you describe the
sound of your band?
JP: Ah… Not very dubstep-ey- we
have bumslaps on the album! We have
bumslaps! Yeah, we do!
KC: Is that your description of the
sound then? Bumslaps?
JP: It literally is! Bumslaps! When we
were recording it we thought, ah man,
if anybody comes in right now, they’re
gonna be faced with me and Dave bend-
ing over with a microphone. It’s in the
song ‘Your bed is kind of frightening’.
Yeah, you can’t quite get it, you sit there
trying to clap it with your hands, trying
to figure it out, but you can’t quite get
that clap going. <claps>
KC: So, you have to spend a lot of
time together as a band- has anyone
got any odd habits?
JP: Yeah, Jamie complains about every-
thing. Dave constantly talks about need-
ingtohaveawank.OhandSamhaswheat
intolerance!Hejustgetsreallysleepy.And
he’s always eating sandwiches!
KC: Anyway, so the band uses a lot of
different time signatures so you must
have had quite a musical upbringing.
Did anyone play any hilariously embar-
rassing instruments when they were
younger? Like the piccolo?
JP: Dave plays viola- he’s been play-
ing it since he was about 4. He should
be really awesome- he was playing it
regimentally for a while. I didn’t have
a musical upbringing. The way it goes
is, I write a song, Dave goes ‘you’re a
bastard, that’s 5 and it should go into 7
and it doesn’t work’ and I say ‘I have no
idea what you’re talking about’.
KC:So will you tell us why you named
the band Tubelord?
JP: No.
KC: Is it to do with Youtube?
JP: Definitely, probably… no. You
were so close!
KC: Another quick question- do you
like pokemon?
JP: Ahhhh. Yes. I got them into our
new song! Join the Abra Kadabra
<starts singing>
I like your questions, they’re refreshing!
KC: What are most questions like?
Interview me in the style of a generic
interview!
JP: Ok I have a normal question to
start with: Noodles or sauce? What are
they on about noodles or sauce?!
KC: Finally, in a battle between Char-
izard, Venusaur and Blastoise, who
would you be backing?
JP: At first, Blastoise because it begins
with a B. Then maybe Venusaur, but
then I’d think Charizard’s quite good,
but then I wouldn’t want the one that
Ash has, so probably Venusaur. But
yeah. Blastoise is good. But who’s to
say I told the truth in any part of this
interview?
