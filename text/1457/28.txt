Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,457
Solution 1456
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word. And worth double.

eh. This week has been
up and down. After a
pretty amazing Friday af-
ternoon/evening taking
some pretty sexy pictures of my solder
(lead-free I’d have you know), I hit the
bar. And what did I find in the bar?
Only a RAG/CGCU slave auction with
free Sambuka on offer. Yes your eyes
do not deceive you, free ‘buca for shits
sake! They were talking my language.
After deliberation with my gang (not
the gun wielding hoodlum type gang,
we’re too pussy for that) we decided
that ‘buca time was now. And now.
And now... I’m sure you see where
that went. Anyhoo, I was auctioned
off for the lofty price of £30 to spend
an hour with a female I’d decided to
avoid. Dealbreaker. Turned out to be
a very enjoyable evening and consider-
ably better than having to wear a Bikini
at this Wednesday’s ACC barnight,
although I probably would have done
that anyway if asked in the right way.
If anyone else is interested in my com-
pany for and hour, mail to the usual ad-
dress please.
But from there things started to go
wrong. I contracted the worst of all
flu-type virus known man... that’ll be
the dreaded ‘man flu.’ Now this is an ill-
ness that the fairer sex have a very poor
grasp of. Just because I am still up and
walking does not mean that I just have
a little sniffle and I’m acting like a big
baby about it. Oh no. I am literally, as
Bob Dylan so eloquently put it ‘knock
knock knocking on heaven’s door’. I
feel like death, got a temperature of
38.2, banging headache, sore throat,
rasping cough and I’m knackered by
10am. Plus haven’t had a beer for a
f*cking week. But do I get any sympa-
thy? No I just get told to man up, and
that I’m not even ill. Man up? Man up?
Surly the fact that I’m not lying in my
bed watching so much daytime TV
that I’m bored to the point of shitting
myself just to liven things up proves
manning up is well underway.
Whilst sometimes us men can, pos-
sibly exaggerate our trials and tribula-
tions in order to get a bit of cheap sym-
pathy, in reality we just want a cuddle,
unless you are a hyper-man-man in
which case the steroids are probably
addling your mind. What you should
do is spend a little less time popping
willy shrinking pills. Just a thought.
Wordpath 1,457
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
