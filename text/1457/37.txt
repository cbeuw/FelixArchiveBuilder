I Overall it has been a great season for the
ladies 2s. After an initial slow start to the
season we got into our stride and went on
to enjoy a 10 match winning streak (which
coincidently started by beating the medics
9-2). It has also been a high-scoring season
for us with 58 goals to date. We did well in
BUCS finishing joint third, but our biggest
achievement of the season is finishing top of
our ULU league.
Being in the same BUCS and ULU leagues as
the medics, we have faced each other three
times already this season and have won once
and drawn twice. This makes for an exciting
Varsity match and we will be looking for
another win against the medics to end our
season in style.

We’ve had a massive influx of new players into
the first team this season, which has really
helped to mix things up. It’s taken a while for
everyone to find their niche but with hard
work and dedication we are capable of playing
some first class hockey. Our new coach this
year has helped us to focus on core skills
and through his feedback and guidance we
have been able to up our game, which should
leave us in a strong position in our BUCS
league. Varsity is such a highly anticipated
game and year on year we have a tough
match against Imperial. We relish the
challenge of playing a team that is a league
above us in BUCS and although we may
enter this game as the underdogs, we
will not stop fighting for the title until
the final whistle blows.

The Medics Ladies 2nd hockey team have had
a good season. We’re the first to admit that
we’re not yet (and never really will be!) hockey
pros, so having fun is a big priority. Competing
in the BUCS South Eastern League 5A and
ULU division 3, there have been some fantastic
wins and some losses. Whatever the outcome
though, team spirit has been high and we’ve
had plenty of laughs! We’ve also welcomed
quite a few new players to our squad who have
been valuable assets to both the team and the
club. I’d like to say a big thanks to everyone in
the squad, including this year’s Varsity team.
Following a very recent 2-2 draw against IC,
we’re as eager as ever and ready to fight for this
year’s Varsity.

The IC Ladies 1s have been working hard,
accomplishing a very successful season. In the
ULU league, the team has won all matches
played so far and stands with a record of 16
goals in 3 matches. More importantly, after
comfortable beating the strongest teams
in BUCS, the team has made the league so
exciting that promotion will be decided on the
last fixture of the season. Ladies 1s have good
chances of getting promoted to the South
Eastern Conference 1A, as we are facing
Chichester 2s (team we’ve already
trashed with a boring 12-0 victory).
The IC Ladies 1s will be facing the
medics at Varsity after having played
them in the ULU cup final this Sunday.
Playing a league above them in both
ULU and BUCS, we will be looking to
enforce our game from the beginning
on both the final and Varsity. So
watch out during Varsity, cause
Sunday’s results will still be in
everyone’s minds...
