This season has been an encouraging one
for IC 3s, having been promoted in our ULU
league last year, we have managed to take
to the new league, remaining high up in the
tables. The most reliable team - turning up to
every training, match and social, Netball 3s set
an example to the rest of the club. The team
have gotten to know each other well, both on
and off court, enabling match performance
to improve week after week. With more
determination than ever, the girls are surprising
themselves with their fighting spirit. Beware
medics, this is our year!

Our season so far has been amazingly fun!
We started off the year with a brand spanking
new team who had never played together
before, so while at the start of the year we
tried desperately to remember how to play
netball after having the summer off, we’ve all
developed together as a team and now form
a strong side who are getting stronger all the
time. Last year our 4s were the only team to
beat the medics so this year we’re aiming to
really wipe the floor with them, so watch out
medics, we’re coming to get you!

Last season we were relegated from our
BUCS league and finished in the bottom
half of our ULU league. The first half on the
season was unlucky. Although we very much
had the talent within the team, a lack of
training and experience of playing together
meant we lost a lot of matches. The second
half of the season has been more successful.
We have improved as a team and are now
comfortably beating teams that we had
lost to at the start of the season. We are
currently 3rd from top in our BUCS league
and about half way up in our ULU league. As
far as Varsity goes we have played and lost
to the Medics twice this season. They have
an advantage over us in terms of height and
they have been playing together as a team
for far longer. However, if we play our best
netball, we are capable of making the match
extremely close. At Varsity anything can
happen, and we won’t go down without a
fight.

Having such hard working and committed
players makes my job as captain far easier,
which is why we as a team have had such
great success in netball this year.
Considering the very high standard of
netball this year, we’ve done really well in
both leagues. Currently ranked 2nd place
in ULU after only having lost 1 game, and
coming 3rd in the BUCS league. We’ve also
managed to get through to the ULU cup
final after several challenging games which
will be played on March 20th against Kings
College.
The highlight of the netball year as always
will be Varsity which I’m very excited for.
Having been triumphant twice this year
against IC, I am confident we can continue
our success and come away victorious.

I am incredibly proud of what the team
has achieved this year. We expected a
tough time in BUCS following promotion
last year, but victory against St. George’s
ensured we will stay up and are on track
for a 3rd or 4th place finish. In the ULU
cup we reached the quarter-finals, losing
narrowly to a team in the Premiership. We
aimed for promotion in our ULU league,
although we haven’t achieved this, we
should finish high in the table. Our record
against IC remains impeccable. We knocked
the 3s out of the cup with a decisive 20 goal
thrashing, and aim to better this at Varsity.
One of my favourite moments of the season
was beating IC 2s in the ULU league. It’s
very amusing when a team demands at the
end ‘how could you POSSIBLY beat us?’ –
although we didn’t understand the surprise
as we are a BUCS league above them and
haven’t lost the fixture since 2007!

Having been promoted into a higher division
in ULU at the end of last season we were all
apprehensive about whether we could adapt
to a much tougher standard of netball this
year. Luckily, we have not been disappointed
and will be finishing this season well within
the top half of our new division . The season
started with victories over LSE, Queen
Mary’s 3s and 4s, Royal Holloway and RUMS.
To increase our number of fixtures, we have
played a number of friendly matches against
other teams. This included a nail biting 28-27
victory over GKT as well as wins against
RUMS and St Georges.
Our hope for Varsity this year, besides
winning, is to play the best we have ever
played and enjoy what will definitetly be a
highly competetive match.

ICU Netball 2nds has had an outstanding
season, a compliment to both the new
players who have joined the team and the last
year’s remaining team members. Team spirit
together with great banter and truly talented
members has been the key to success with
a promotion in BUCS and what should have
been a promotion in ULU. Only underhand
tactics from some dirty medics hailing from
another university, they all blend into one
after a while, denied us what should have
been rightfully ours.
Bitter? Yes, just a bit. An earlier game in the
season against the medics saw us fall by
the way side in the 3rd quarter due to bit of
mismanagement. Nonetheless, we are back
on top form, pumped from the gym and a
few heavy nights at the union, ready to take
on the students from the polytechnic down
the road.

Having been promoted in both our ULU
and BUCS leagues after our 2008/2009
season; ICSM 2s netball had high hopes
for making a dent in our new leagues.
Nearing the end of the season; we are
currently winning both of our new leagues,
hoping for another double promotion and
exceeding all my expectations as captain.
We are also in the ULU Reserve Cup final
for the first time; hoping for a win against
GKT 2s.
Of my 3 years on the team; this has been
our most successful and ambitious season.
With my team playing the best I have ever
seen and with a win over IC 2s already
this year, I am expecting another Varsity
victory. I could not be more proud of my
players and hope we continue our success!
Bring on IC!
