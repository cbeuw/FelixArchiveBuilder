ICHC Men’s 1st XI have endured a tough
season in the BUCS competition. After gaining
promotion to the South East 1A league last
year, they have come up against some tough
opposition and have lost several extremely
close games by very narrow margins.
Progress in the ULU league and cup
competitions has, by contrast, been much
better, with the team through to the finals of
the ULU Cup and in a strong position
to retain their ULU Premier
League title at the end of
March. With only a small
number of players departing
this season, the Men’s 1sts will be
hoping for a swift return to the top of
the South East structure in 2011.
The Men’s 1st XI will be expecting to retain
their Varsity crown for the fourth year in a
row, having already beaten the Medics on two
separate occasions this season.

Last year’s Varsity was an embarrassment;
loosing 5-0 was not the way we wanted to
see out the season. The humiliation of not
even scoring a goal was too much and this
year we aim to set the record straight. So
far we have played IC 3 times in the regular
season. We really tested them in our first
encounter narrowly loosing 2-1. In the
second fixture we lost badly, 5-1 on a night
reminiscent of Varsity 2009 where the
medics were torn apart by an impressive IC
team. Our final encounter was in the semi-
final of the ULU cup where we matched
IC over seventy minutes and into the final
minute of extra time where we were beaten
by an unstoppable goal. The last encounter
especially shows that we really have what
it takes to compete with IC and this Varsity
will be no drubbing, not if the medic hockey
boys can help it.

The season started well with a number of good
wins which put us in a strong position in the
BUCS league. Post Christmas our performance
has not been as strong due to a number of
player being absent for various reasons.
However, we plan to remedy this with a strong
performance at Varsity.

The ICHC 2nd XI are on the way to winning
the ULU Cup and looking to finish in the top
two positions of the BUCS league. The team
will face the Medics for the fourth time this
season at Varsity. IC won all three previous
encounters - the last match finishing 4-3.
Varsity promises a tasty display of intense
Hockey. Men to look out for are: JD
practising his golf swing at short corners,
Maximuscle Bill pumped up in attack,
Blackman Briggs pacing down the right side
and Lazy Fresher Hunt throwing aerials in
midfield.
