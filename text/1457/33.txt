I would like to take this opportunity
to thank all players who have played
in the BUCS 1A Badminton League.
We did remarkably well this year,
we came top of the league! We are
now participating in the playoff and
hopefully we will get promoted to
the Premier League next year!
tWe still have one match left, come
on Imperial, we can do it!

First of all, I would like to say that
we finished 3rd in Division 1A
which is a very respectable result.
After a long series of draws and
losses, we finally pulled ourselves
together and won the last two
matches of the season convincingly.
Varsity should be exciting this
year as we have three freshers
playing and for the first time there
is also a Badminton Mixed match.
Having just won the Premier ULU
Mixed league, we are hungry for
more matches, and hopeful and
confident of continuing with our
winning streak.

up ahead of the game; evaluating the benefits of
sports drinks and identifying if they can really help
improve performance, plus lots more!
What you do just before a game can have a big
impact on what you’re able to do during it. Many
athletes prepare for a training session by carry-
ing out some routine stretching exercises, but
it’s important to remember that stretching helps
to improve your static flexibility and may not do
such a good job at preparing your body to move
quickly and efficiently. Therefore, dynamic mobil-
ity exercises during your pre-workout warm up
will prepare your body for vigorous movements.
Most sports involve forceful, strenuous activity
and mobility exercises stimulate your nervous sys-
tem, muscles, tendons & joints in a very dynamic
manner. Examples of these would be; half squats,
side bends, ankle bounces & leg swings. A well pre-
pared warm up session not only prepares the body
physically, but also physiologically.
The warm up also plays a major part at preparing
you psychologically. A well organised team, feeling
confident knowing that you have had the time to
physically & psychologically prepare, focusing on
your individual role, will play a major part in the
outcome of the game. From the perspective of the
opposition a well organised looking warm-up ses-
sion can have already placed negative thoughts and
energy, leaving them feeling defeated before the
game has even begun.
A pre-competition meal is an important part
of your preparation, however so is what you eat
a week before! You should fill up your Glycogen
stores, so you begin your competition with a full
fuel supply! On the morning of your competition,
you should focus on a meal high in Carbohydrate,
low in fat, protein and fibre. Complex carbohy-
drates release energy slowly. Examples of these
would be: wholegrain breakfast cereals, boiled rice,
sweet potatoes & boiled pasta. Avoid simple carbs
as these release energy quicker, but produce insulin,
so therefore making you feel tired slowly. Examples
of these would be; muesli bars, cakes & biscuits, ce-
reals, puddings and soft drinks.
Make sure you are well hydrated before the com-
petition having your last drink around 15-20 min-
utes before you start, drinking at regular intervals
throughout the game.
Depletion of the body’s carbohydrate stores and
dehydration are two factors that will limit pro-
longed exercise. The recommendation of sports
drinks is based on a number of factors like the type
of sport the person is engaged in, its intensity and
duration, athlete’s nutritional status and many
more. Commercial sports drinks that are hitting the
market primarily consist of water, carbohydrate,
and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, and potassium).
The need for sports drink nutrition also depends
upon the athlete’s dehydration status. There are
sports that cause heavy loss of fluids and it is there
where these sports drinks play a major role, pre-
venting your body from getting dehydrated. Per-
formance levels also tend to get adversely affected,
owing to the depletion of the body’s carbohydrate
stores and dehydration, which takes place while
carrying out sporting activities.
When sweating takes place during the perform-
ance of sports, it tends to cause loss of fluids and
electrolytes (minerals such as chloride, calcium,
phosphate, magnesium, sodium and potassium),
therefore making the body dehydrated.
Dehydration if not taken care of, can take an
ugly shape by causing circulatory collapse and heat
stroke. This is where the benefits of a sports drink
can be very well applied. When the fluid loss takes
place in the body, it leads to impaired performance
and the capacity for performing muscular work also
deteriorates. Therefore, these sports drinks defi-
nitely aid in improving the performance level of an
athlete, by acting as energy booster.
To make your Varsity day a winning one, make
sure you prepare yourself not just on the day, but
ahead of time. As mentioned, it is important to fo-
cus on what you eat, not just on the day, but a week
before too! Start mentally preparing yourself dur-
ing warm-up sessions & focusing on your individual
role.
A well organised team is a winning one!
