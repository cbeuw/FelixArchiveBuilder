Alexander McQueen’s final presentation migrated from its original venue of La Conciergerie - Lee’s favourite place -
to Hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre, an estate owned by the brand’s parent company PPR. The fashion show has been
reduced to an intimate presentation for selected members of the press and buyers. The 16 designs were penned by Lee
McQueen, and were about 80% finished at the time of his untimely death. The collection was inspired by the angels and
demons in the dark ages. The jacquard patterns were plated with gold; the fabrics were heavy to acheive a ‘statue feel’.
This collection will only be available bespoke for private clients. As the final model marched down the hall, she murmured
‘There’s no more.’ And indeed, the presentation became the last chance for fans to mourn the tragic loss of a true talent.

S
uffice it to say excitement isn’t
an element in the Parisenne
look book this season.
Designers head for the safe
options en masse, sticking to minimal-
ism, hour-glass silhouettes and pretty
accessories. Chloe, Celine and Stella
McCartney may well be condensed
into one house, after all, these three
have a closely woven history. Stella
used to be head of Chloe, succeeded
by her then assistant Phoebe Philo.
Phoebe Philo then took over Celine a
season ago. Louis Vuitton has shown
the most unimaginative collection to
date. The 50s look - Grace Kelly style
- no more, no less.
John Galliano has run out of juice,
the new show is a compilation of all
the good old shows - Dior re-ran the
equestrian theme from its Haute Cou-
ture collection. Galliano’s own brand is
a mish-mash of his old flame of Czar
glamour and clown-like brilliance.
The exhausting week culminated in
Chanel going nuts, putting Yetis on an
iceberg. A real iceberg shipped all the
way from Sweden to Paris. How do the
Chanel people solve the logistics prob-
lem involved in negotiating a melty
mountain through the notorious Pa-
risian traffic? But then it’s hard to take
them serious with a fur bodysuit that
makes you look like a mountain bear...
The real question is, can we blame
the designers? The designs were
penned at the height of a global re-
cession. Champagne is less frequently
swigged; a night-out becomes a night-
in. Sellability becomes directly propor-
tional to wearability. While a full-on
grasshopper inspired dress dazzles at a
party, carrying on with daily activities
is a completely different story.
Fashion is like restaurants, one
of the hardest hit industries when
the economy goes south. Whenever
money can be saved, why spend an
extra penny? People automatically go
for safer options, for example, versa-
tile skirts that can be worn Monday
through to Friday, and a £30 saving
from the dry cleaners.
Coats that are good quality and
can be passed down from genera-
tion to generation will prove a good
investment too. So look at Burberry,
Hermes, Chloe - millions of different
styles of jackets and coats.
If you can count all the peacoats you
have seen this season, the drinks are
on me!
Ok, so we’ve all heard of primers. Do
they really enhance your looks, or are
they just a useless waste of money? All
major cosmetics brands now produce
a range of primers, from Mac to No.7,
and you can pay as much or as little as
you like, but is it worth it?
What are Primers?
Primers are usually silicon-based gels
or creams. You put them on before you
apply your foundation. Many of them
are SPF15, so they protect against the
harmful UVA and UVB rays that age
skin.
Why do you need them?
The first reason you’ll need them is
that they help your foundation to stay
on for longer. Secondly, they smooth
out the skin, so that the skin has an
even-texture. Finally, they even out
the skin tone, neutralising red areas or
dark circles under the eyes.
They are especially good for people
with oily and combination skin, as they
tend to reduce the shiny, oily appear-
ance of those problematic areas, like
chins and foreheads.
How do you use them?
Primers can be applied in a similar way
to liquid foundation. Smooth a thin
layer on your face with your finger,
motion downwards, going in the direc-
tion of growth of your facial hair.
Which one should you go for?
Although the idea of primers is a fairly
new of concept in the world of make-
up and beauty, there are a fair few on
the market, so which one is right for
you? The award-winning Smashbox
Photo Finish Primer (£30/27.5ml,
Strawberry NET Cosmetics) is oil-free
and suitable for all skin types. It sinks
in easily on the skin and feels gorgeous.
A more accessible, middle-priced op-
tion is bareMinerals Prime Time
foundation primer (£18/30ml, House
of Fraser). It is made by the people
who advocate ‘natural’ make-up. It’s
fragrance-free, with no preservatives
or fillers and contains extra vitamins
to enhance your skin’s natural health.
This is the perfect option for those
who have blemishes or sensitive skin.
And if you’re counting your pennies
this term, like me, you can go for No.7
Colour Calming Primer (£10.25/40ml,
Boots). This primer is available in lav-
ender or green colours, and is designed
to counter any colour imbalances in
your skin tone. The lavender colour
works against yellow, sallow colour
tones, and the green is made to coun-
teract red pigments in the skin, and
each are aimed to brighten the skin,
and also work excellently as primers.
The product is white
but as you apply it
on your skin it goes
clear and it gets
absorbed quickly.
It leaves a thin
layer of satin-feel
base. The skin
looks healthy and
make-up stays on
all-night. 2 pumps
are enough to cover
your whole face.
This is slightly harder to apply
compared to many other primers. Its
texture is thicker and gooier, but when
a sponge is used, the primer actually
goes on fine. This primer is drier
compared to others, but this is due
to its oil absorbent property, so it’s
Keeps foundation
smooth and in
place all day. Prime
Time definitely
helps make-up look
better. This primer
helps get rid of
the look that the
powder is simply
sitting on the skin.
It is non-greasy so it
feels comfortable to
boot.

perfect for oily skin
and make-up can
stay for hours.
However, if your
skin tends to get
dehydrated easily,
this may not be the
perfect solution for
you. The dry texture
of the primer can
cause make up to
crumble and crease.
So, know your skin
type!
