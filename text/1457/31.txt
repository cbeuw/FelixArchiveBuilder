Varsity - “Lets do sport and get poon*”
*You won’t get poon and even if you do, it will be Sainsbury’s Basics poon: cheap with a funny after-taste

Yeh he took off his mask and da marshall caught
him with powder all ova his nose. He’s been
banned for life now lol
S
o next week yet another
Imperial event to not give a
shit about - That’s right, it’s
Varsity! The bitter rivalry be-
tween scientists and Medics
is ignited as teams of hot-headed de-
generates line up to take battle in a va-
riety of sports. Yeah, it’s easy to make
something sound exciting, like ‘the
ULTIMATE BIRO’ or ‘THE UNFOR-
GIVING WHISK’. I can tell you right
now that I have and will forever have
more fun with my ultimate biro than I
would watching a bunch of rowdy apes
fumble about with a ball. This forced
medieval antagonism is laughable. It’s
comparable to Romeo and Juliet - two
sides hating each other, but not really
sure why. At least Romeo and Juliet
has a plot-line and duels to the death.
Duelling is the sport of men. DO NOT
MISCONSTRUE THIS WITH FENC-
ING! I mean proper swords, with
proper blood and proper screams of
agony, not two guys in silly white suits
poking each other with bendy sticks.
Pouring a pint down someone’s shirt
and then punching them in the face
is hardly comparable to a well placed
rapier-thrust to the abdomen. There
are lots of people at Imperial I would
love to see disembowelled. What,
that shocks you? Nothing annoys me
more than people telling me it’s wrong
to wish people dead. 1.8 people die a
second worldwide, a couple more is
barely going to make a statistical dif-
ference and if it’s the only permanent
solution to having to listen to egotistic
stories about pounding that slutty fat
girl from DB’s, I really couldn’t give a
shit. Now if people have read previous
Hangman articles I’m sure they will
have noticed a distinct intolerence of
the Imperial rugby team. In all fairness,
you are cunts and that’s not going to
change, but we admire you for taking
it light-heartedly. If truth be told, you
are unanimously out-cunted by the
football team. The reason Hangman
has strayed from mentioning them
previously is largely due to the fact
that the moniker ‘The Rugby Team’
has just become a collective term for
anyone we find acting like a twat in the
union. As Hangman strives for fair-
ness and equailty, it is only right that
we conduct an unbiased investigation
into who exactly thought it would be a
great idea to strip down to their waist
in dB’s and proceed to slide, Klinsmann
style, across a table covered in cider
and vomit. Ohhh, it’s the football team.
What a hilarious stunt! It certianly im-
pressed the surrounding crowd, well
the surrounding football team. Every-
one else just thought you looked like
a twat. You know what would be fun-
nier? how about you smash a few bot-
tles across the table before you glide
across gleefully like a retarded child on
the back of a dolphin? Then, fingers
crossed, you’ll die and you won’t get
beer on my coat again. Like I say, 1.8 a
second, I really don’t give a shit!
