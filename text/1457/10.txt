Clegg offers £2.5bn to improve schools
Leader of the Liberal Democrats,
Nick Clegg, has asked head teachers
to “raise their game” in exchange for a
proposed £2.5bn funding. Nick Clegg
has called on schools to reinvent the
curriculum, raise results and close the
attainment gap between rich and poor,
an important step towards equality.
In a speech at the Association of
School and College Leaders confer-
ence, Nick Clegg promised to find
“extra funding, even while elsewhere
there are cuts”. However, in return the
“greatest expectations” will be placed
on schools and head teachers. The Lib-
Clegg’s education

Economic storm not
over, warns Brown
Gordon Brown said the
worst of the recession is
over, but our economy re-
mains “fragile” and could
be undermined if the Con-
servatives’ spending cuts
are introduced too quickly.
The Liberal Democrats say

spending and government
support for business and
jobs must continue. The
Tories have said the biggest risk to an economic recovery was
Mr Brown staying in power and that the key is to act to cut the
deficit to begin straight after the election. Gordon Brown also
announced a pay freeze for all senior public servants.
Hague vows to return
UK to world stage
Voters in Switzerland
have rejected a recent
proposal to introduce
a national system of
state-funded lawyers
to represent labradors
(pictured), amongst
other animals, in
court. Animal rights
groups proposed the
move, but the pro-
posal was rejected by
around 70% of voters
in a referendum. Opponents, including the Swiss govern-
ment, had argued that Switzerland did not need more legis-
lation. Switzerland already has some of the strictest animal
welfare legislation in the world.

Shadow foreign sec-
retary William Hague
said the UK’s eco-
nomic and diplomatic
power has steadily
reduced under Labour
and the UK risked “re-
treating into its shell”.
Mr Hague argued the
UK’s international
economic status was
“diminishing” under
Labour and the UK
risked dropping out of the list of the world’s top ten econo-
mies by 2015. With regard to Europe, William Hague said the
Tories would seek to play a constructive role on issues such
as trade, the environment and energy security.
eral Democrats are proposing a pupil
premium system where an average of
£2,500 would be attached to each pu-
pil from a disadvantaged background
and go directly to the school they are
attending. This money would be on
top of the existing education budg-
et, leading to an overall increase in
education spending. In contrast, the
Conservatives have proposed a simi-
lar system but using money already
in the education budget to fund it,
effectively only redistributing exist-
ing funds.
A report by the Institute of Fiscal
Studies suggested that pupil premium
schemes would lead to budget cuts in
a significant minority of schools un-
less extra money was attached. In the
Liberal Democrats’ plans, the premi-
um is funded from outside the budget.
This may lead to increased cuts in oth-
er areas as set out in the party’s current
plans.
Under the current system, schools
get money for the deprivation levels
in the local authority area rather than
within the schools themselves. Under
this system, state schools in affluent
areas get a small amount of money. In
these areas, people can afford to send
their children to private schools, leav-
ing the less well-off constituents of the
area to go to the underfunded local
state school.
Mr Clegg told the conference he
wanted Britain to be a place “where
it is no longer possible, on a pupil’s
first day of school, to predict how well
they’ll do simply by asking them how
much their parents earn”.
“So, a deal between government and
schools: Money and freedom in re-
turn for high expectations and more
ambition.
“We will give a level of freedom you
haven’t known for decades. But, in re-
turn, we will place the greatest expec-
tations on you any government ever
has.
“One - we will expect you to trans-
form the curriculum, so that it is rich,
relevant and stretches the brightest pu-
pils while elevating those who struggle.
“Two - we will be much more ambi-
tious about the number of young men
and women leaving school with good
results.
“Three - we will expect you to close
the gap between poorer children and
their wealthier classmates, a gap which
entrenches inequality in Britain today.”
“Extra funding [for
education], even
while elsewhere
there are cuts”
