FELIX FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 14
Boat Club; Fours Head of the River 1986
I C F o u r s I m p r e s s
On Saturday a total of 12 crews
from Imperial competed in the
Fours Head. This race, which is the
climax of the Autumn races for
Fours, attracted a total of over 520
crews from all over Britain. All
events were hotly contested with
many Commonwealth and World
Championship medalists entered in
the top events.
The top Imperial crew racing in
the Open coxless fours finished in
5th place, a mere 13 seconds behind
the winners and several places in
front of the U L crew! In both the
Senior A coxed and Senior A coxless
fours, IC crews were unlucky
finishing a close second to the
Cambridge University Crews. The.
IC crews entered in the womens
fours, mens Novice and mens Senior
C events showed promise finishing
well up in their respective divisions.
The stars of the day, however,
were the Senior B four who,
following up their impressive
victory last week, again showed
what talent there is throughout the
whole club. They convincingly won
the coxless fours event, overcoming
all of V B A Roper's steering
difficulties, and then, having
changed boats' and taken a cox
onboard, rowed straight back up to
the start and raced again over the
three and a half mile course to win
the Senior B coxed fours event—a
very impressive result!
FOOTBALL; IC III 3, St Marys 13
Thirds Force Draw
Last Wednesday a somewhat below
par performance from IC 3rds still
forced a draw to put them above the
2nds in the league. The 3rds,
perhaps suffering from comp-
lacency after their emphatic cup
win, failed to take the early initiative
and seize control of a fairly dour
first half. The visitors took the lead
when a flicked-on free kick was
stabbed in through a crowd of
players. With a little more urgency a
set piece almost saw the equalizer; a
short Paul Thompson free kick was
crossed by Paul Savage and Mark
Woodgate headed just over. Hideo
Takano speculatively curled the
equalizer and a few minutes later a
Paul Thompson free kick was
headed home by an unmarked Paul
Savage 'not quite' ghosting in at the
far post.
Perhaps somewhat fortunate to
be leading at the interval, the 3rds
began the second half with more
aggression. St Mary's equalised
through a 40 yard free kick; keeper
Ferggus Batstone deciding to let the
net stop the ball instead of catching
it. Sloppy defending against a
throw-in let the opposition steal the
lead. Still not playing their best
football, the 3rds probed for the
equalizer. The visitors became
nervy; crude challenges and dissent
resulted in three of them being
booked and one sent off for
attacking Martin Lake. In the dying
minutes Paul Thompson circum-
navigated the penalty area and
unleashed a tremendous left-footer
just inside the post.
A mediocre performance by the
3rds really deserved no more than a
draw, but the unbeaten run
continues.
Team: F. Batstone, C. Gordon, M.
Lake, M. Woodgate (C), K. Graves,
C. Budgen, P. Thompson, H. Jakano,
P. Savage, D. Semeria, W. Charles.
Ten Pins Toppled
For once IC managed to put a full
team out. This didn't necessarily
mean they would all get there in one
piece. Thanks to the driver's
attraction to a red 2CV the C team
arrived in a state of shock.
This spread rapidly through the
whole team as we were given a
lesson in how to bowl properly.
There was a glimmer of hope when
the A team held Portsmouth's away
team to a tied first game, C.
Wheeldon being the star with the
highest score of the day, 196.
However the other teams were taken
to the cleaners, and the only other
game in which we scored was the
final B team one, when the
opposition was one man short.
Birmingham
Dominate
On Saturday 15th, IC hosted the
South East Region U A U fencing
competition. Unfortunately, we
were not able to repeat last years'
success in this event, and lost
narrowly to Kings College.
We started the competition with
two of our team members
missing—foilist Adam Andreski
was injured and one of our sabreurs
failed to turn up. A team was
assembled, however, and we started
off with the sabre match.
The sabre was hard-fought and
we ended up losing narrowly (5-4).
Unfortunately, the IC foil team
were not at their best, and lost 7-2:
this meant that we could only afford
to lose 1 bout at epee.
Full marks must go to the
epeeists, who fought hard to level
the overall score at 13-13. In a tense
finish, however, we just failed to pull
off what would have been an
amazing comeback.
The overall winners of the
competition were UCL, who now go
forward to the next round.
Team: Jon Davy (Captain), Rick
Jarvis, Simon Holden, Simon
Chenery and Kim Ming Looi.
We meet in the Union gym at
12.30 on Thursday for tuition, and
more informally on Friday evenings
from about 6.00-8.00. Anyone is
most welcome to come along to
watch or participate—just bring a
pair of trainers, loose trousers and a
t-shirt.

Stalemate
This was bound to be a hard-fought
and close match, as St. Thomas',
last year's losing finalists, would
obviously want to take out IC, who
won the cup. Both teams went out
onto Harlington field determined to
win, and in the end had to settle for a
draw. St. Thomas' won the toss and
elected to kick-off, which suited
Imperial as they wanted to play
against the wind in the first half. St.
Thomas' put the kick-off over IC's
dead ball line, and a scrum was
given in the centre ofthe pitch. This
first scrum was a shock for the
medics, as IC's loose-head prop,
Josh Somhon, and hooker Andy
Martin combined to wreck a strong
St. Thomas' front run. The first
quarter of the was all IC, as they
piled on the pressure. St. Thomas'
were saved by the excellent boot of
their fly-half, who was greatly
helped by the wind in the first half.
Half-time came with IC having won
the lion's share of possession in the
scrums, and, thanks to eighth man
Steve Parker, a fair amount of line-
out ball too; St Thomas' were quick
around the field, however, and the
loose ball quite often went their
way. The second half was as hard
fought as the first, and the last 45
seconds saw some frantic defence by
the hospital side as IC pressed
forward. The replay will be on
Saturday 22nd November, and IC
are confident of going through!
Sailing
Kings Win
Last Saturday the IC Sailing Team
travelled to Birmingham University.
During a series of races that lasted
all day the Birmingham team
triumphed, despite a valiant effort
by the IC team. Although consistent
results were achieved, the tactical
advantage held by the Birmingham
team due to the light and variable
nature of the wind ensured their
success. Helms Richard Brimelow,
Apostolos Leonidhopoulos and
Gareth David sailed well, and
Fresher helm Richard Jarman sailed
consistently, but all lacked the fine
edge needed.
In a second series of races the
ladies team had their first match of
the season. Helms Jenny Bingham,
Sam Page and Helen Morgan all
sailed well, showing great promise
for the rest of the season and future
years, but were also unable to pull
off a victory.
