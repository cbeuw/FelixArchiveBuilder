Courtney
at Kings
When Courtney Pine appeared
on stage at Kings College on
November 14th he was greeted by a
packed hall consisting of devoted
followers and other curious to see
what was so great about this British
saxophonist who, if the press is to
believed, is destined to become one
of the all-time greats of jazz.
As soon as he started playing it
became clear. Pine is a brilliant
musician and he was backed by
talented piano, bass and drum
players. The set consisted of modern
and traditional jazz as well as re-
arrangements of traditional African
music, and a selection of music from
his recently released debut album
'Journey to the Urge Within'. The
sheer variety and energy of Pine's
playing kept the audience swaying
for two hours and he was met with
continually estatic applause.
Jazz is more conducive to a seedy
night-club than King's Nelson
Mandella Hall, but the atmosphere
was electric. Courtney Pine has an
almost naive approach to
performing, he was genuinally
surprised that anyone present had
ever heard of his album, and then
explained that 'this piece had to be
the last' because he had to get the
night-bus home! However he
showed no sign of nerves and clearly
enjoyed every second of the show.
Pine is a talented player and
writer (he penned much of 'Journey
to the Urge Within') and this,
together with his down to earth
approach leads me to believe the
critics. Although he has played in
London alot recentiy, for example
at the Camden and Soho jazz
festivals, time may be running out
for you to see him as, apparently, a
move to New York is likely soon.
It is often easy to appreciate
recorded jazz as it is to appreciate
live, but Courtney Pine does have
that extra dimension that makes it
well worth scouring the listings for
details of any of his future live dates.

Black Venus by Angela Carter
Published by Picador £2.95
This is an exciting set of eight
stories, original, witty and daring,
by the woman who helped write the
script for 'A Company of Wolves'.
These tales are all very innovative
and different-there is the one about
the runaway girl from the
transportation colony in America
who lives with the Red Indians, or
the son of a Yorkshire chef,
conceived during the cooking of a
lobster souffle. Another strange
story concerns a girl who, as a baby,
was taken by the wolves who ate her
father, and reared by them. When
her human relatives find her again,
eight years later, her wolf-like howls
rouse the wolves to rescue her.
The whole book is full of interest,
action, odd characters and
imagination-ordinary surroundings
witness exotic happenings. This
would make an ideal Chirstmas
present for anyone under 45, or with
a certain flexibility of mind.
