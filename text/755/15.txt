SHAGAR RETURNS
Farmer Shagar, as you may
remember, keeps his sheep in the
garden surrounding his house. The
garden is divided into 8 sections, but
the sheep are free to roam as they
please.
Shagar has both white and black
sheep in the garden, the number of
white sheep being twice the number
of black. His bizarre method of
counting them is to go to each
window of his house and count all
the sheep that he can see (ie.all the
sheep in the 3 sections visible from
that side of the house.) He did this
one day and counted 11 sheep at
every window.
After buying two white sheep and
one black he counted again and
found exactly the same thing, ie.
there were 11 on each side. On both
occasions there was at least one
white and one black sheep in every
section, and there were no more
than 3 of each colour in any section.
How many sheep were there, and
how were they arranged before and
after the purchase?

University is a stage where we, as
talented individuals, learn to make
our ambitions, dreams, come true.
Dreams that were our ideal, our
final place to be. These dreams
formed part of our childhood, our
personality, and what we are today.
Human beings as we are, we
struggle through life, through
decades of school life, in search of
this 'dream'. University provides
such an ultimate step in making this
dream a reality. Years of hard work
in university we plough, but what we
found to be the reality was a rate of
pay after graduation, an initial
salary difference! Like bees
attracted to honey most people fled,
from searching for a dream to
becoming slaves of money
What has happened to our
dreams? What happened to the
enthusiasm we possessed so much of
three years ago? What has happened
to us?
