Clubs FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 15

Health Warning—these articles
have been known to make people
violently sick. This is nauseating,
ignore all. So what has your
Entertainment's Committee got
lined up for the rest of this
seemingly endless Autumn term?
Friday November 21st
The annual all-American Beach
party in that most Riviera-like of
venues—the Lounge. This late
night soiree features our first and
hopefully last repeat perfor-
mance—Three Colors, back by
popular demand from Boston,
Massachusetts, followed by a disco
and the surfing film ' B i g
Wednesday'. It's £1.50 on the night
(50p LSS Ents card) or £ 1 if you
turn up with frost bite and dressed
for the occasion (beachwear?)
Friday November 28th
IC Ents bring you the best of the
new bunch of British bands—The
Bible! The Bible are signed to
Chrysalis records and gained
critical acclaim (and even a little
radio play) with their first single
'Graceland'. This was followed by
their debut album of the same
name.
Saturday December/6th
To celebrate Imperial College
Students' Union's 75th anniversary
we have moved over to the
Sherfield Building for the first
Christmas Carnival in ten years.
The event will be the biggest staged
in College for a long time and if it
goes well, we will be able to get
bigger and better bands—so turn
up please!
Christmas CarnivaLFree mince
pies, late bar until 2am, disco in the
JCR, comedians, Zeke Manyika
(ex-Orange Juice partner and guest
player in The The, Style Council,

and Sandie Shaw (she of Morrisey

fame) in the Great Hall—and it's
only £4.50 in advance (£3.50 with
LSS Ents cards) from the Ents
office. Have fun and see you there.
Consoc Trips
In the light of the wider share
ownership resulting from the
Government's privatisation
programme, the Conservative
Society organised a visit to the Stock
Exchange on Wednesday
November 12th. After spending
some time on the gallery
overlooking the trading floor, a film
was shown detailing the workings of
the Exchange.
Peter Clark
QT Plans
A land of milk and marmalade was
discovered amongst the toast, tea
and cereal at the great annual QT
breakfast on Thursday 13th.
Protected from the lashing rain by a
shield of insanity, the many
members who turned up were
wearing only pyjamas and dressing
gowns.
The previous Tuesday was the QT
Porn Night. Over 15 short films
were shown at 9.00pm, timed so that
anyone who might be offended had
gone to bed by then. It was one of
the most popular events this term
with over thirty members turning
up.
For the following Tuesday,
November 18th, QT booked the
Guilds Hit Squad to hit...the Guilds
Hit Squad. Finally yesterday we
appeared in the RCS Smoking
Concert where we revealed the
secret life of Mr. Benn. He may look
like a calm business man on the
outside, but we revealed him to be
rather dodgy dressing up in other
peoples' clothing and having
adventures!
Coming this Friday, November
28th, is the Wogan Trip followed in
early December by a practice run for
the Tube World Record Attempt.
Next meeting Tuesday November
25th, Southside Bar Upper Lounge
to discuss The Tube World Record
Attempt.
Balloon Ride
Early last Saturday morning the
Balloon Club drove down to
Newbury for a days flying. By the
time re-fueling was completed the
early morning mist had burned off,
so after the pilot, Colin Butter, had
borrowed some matches he was
ready to fly.
Despite a high wind speed the
retrieve van initially had no trouble
keeping up with the balloon as it
followed the A4 east. An hour and a
half later and over twenty miles
further east the retrieve lost the
balloon near Reading when it was
forced to make a detour due to a
closed bridge. Having fruitlessly
searched the area north-east of
Reading, the retrieve followed
standard procedure and retired to a
pub to ring the pilot's house. A
message was passed via the pilot's
wife, giving the location of the
landing and the balloon was quickly
recovered.
There then followed a fast drive
back to Newbury for an evening
flight. Colin wanted to leave early,
so a local pilot, Tony Byrne, was
intercepted on the way to
Sainsburys and persuaded to fly.
While Tony rushed home to get
changed Colin inflated the balloon.
Tony arrived back and took off
immediately with Ed Houlihan and
Barry Sanders for a 'short hop'
before sunset.
Cheap Trips
The Youth Hostelling Club is one of
the most active clubs at IC. We
regularly travel all over the country,
both during term time and in the
vacations.
During term trips are held every
two weeks, departing on Friday
evening and arriving back on
Sunday in time for the last tubes &
buses. So far this year we have
sampled the delights of the Brecon
beacons, Shropshire and the Peak
District. Future events include trips
to Snowdonia, the Lake District,
Northumbria and the Pembroke-
shire coast—making use of bank-
holiday weekends where possible.
The club holds its meeting every
Thursday at 12.30 pm. above
Southside Bar—where details of
weekend excursions are announced.
Being a member of a group such as
ours has great advantages, not just
the cheap cost of travelling as part of
a group. We visit some of the most
beautiful and remote parts of
Britain throughout the year—not
just during the tourist season. The
Welsh mountains covered in snow
on a February morning can be
exceptionally stunning. As a
member of a group, you can gain
access to otherwise closed hostels.
Concert Band
Free
Music
Yes, you've guessed it (you
have?—already?); IC Concert Band
is due to play another free lunch-
time concert in the Mech Eng foyer
on Tuesday November 25th. The

itself. The programme consists of:
William Tell Overture

While your attention has been
grabbed, make a note in your diaries
of the annual "Freeze Your Bells"
Christmas Concert on Tuesday 9th
December at 1.00pm by the Queen's
Lawn. Look out for posters for
details.
