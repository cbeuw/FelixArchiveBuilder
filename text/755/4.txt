Letters. FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 4
Small
Hall
Dear Sir,
We would like to reply to Ian
Hogate's so-called justification of
the rents (issue 753) through your
columns, as we feel that his views are
misguided.
If Weeks is really the most
popular Hall why did 28% of this
year's fresher residents opt for other
College accommodation in
preference to Weeks? (without
knowledge of the new rent
structures incidentally). A survey
conducted amongst residents
showed that by far the main reason
for choosing 'the best-equipped
Hall' was its small size.
On the facilities front, the
kitchens have yet to be properly
upgraded to self-catering standard
and are inferior to those in Linstead
where meals are provided. The
heating is also inadequate as the
repairs promised over the summer
have not been completed.
Peter Hallworth has been
deservedly praised for the remedial
work to bring Southside and Evelyn
Gardens in line with Local
Authority regulations. It is our firm
belief that the lack of ventilation in
the kitchens, showers and toilets is
just one of the ways in which Weeks
contravenes these regulations. The
structural instability of the Hall
means that conference guests only
stay here as a last resort.
On a wider note we feel that the
high rents charged in some
residences will deter more
prospective students than the lower
rents in the Houses will attract and
suggest that it would be in the
College's interest to reconsider the
issue.
Yours sincerely,
Weeks Hall Committee

Martin
Dear Felix,,
I would like to comment
concerning a letter from Ms.
Christine Taig in last week's FELIX
in which the allegation was made
that M r . John Martin has
'Homosexual Tendencies'.
Having known John for well over
two years, I am at a loss to
comprehend this complete
falsehood, and I do not blame him
for the legal action which I
understand him now to be taking as
a result.
Furthermore, the realisation of
Ms. Taig that she should be
perfectly sure of what she puts her
name to should also be clear to the
Editor, Mr. Jones.
If he were doing his job properly
he would have taken appropriate
steps to ensure that allegations are
not unsubstantiated lies. In which
case last week's scurrilous letter
from Ms. Taig would not have been
printed.
A copy of this letter has been sent
to the Rector, and in view of all rules
of decency and fairplay I expect it to
be published in the next copy of
FELIX.
Yours sincerely,,
Jonathan Davies

Trouble in
Chelsea
Dear Dave,
Last Monday night, the manager
of the Cadogan Arms opposite the
Chelsea cinema escorted my two
friends and I, three seemingly
innocent girls waiting for our film to
begin, out of his premises, accusing
us of using it as a youth club and
telling us that we had better not
come back as we would not get
served.
Our only crime was to show our
student faces at his bar, and have a
quiet grumble after he had been
rude to us serving our drinks, and
charged us £2.32 for half a beer, half
a cider and an orange juice and
lemonade. When we got fed up of
being pushed past by the
aforementioned gentleman, who
was piling up the glasses in front of
our noses, we moved to the only
available space—a step in front of a
half empty food cabinet. A couple of
us sat on the step, as others were
doing in the pub, and it was then
that the ever pleasant-manager
reappeared to help us to our feet and
then the door.
I was wondering whether any
other students have experienced the
same treatment and, if so, I would
like to draw their attention to the
awards framed on the wall opposite
the bar for friendly customer service
and the welcoming atmosphere of
the pub.
To save others money and the
indignity of being treated in such a
way, I would like to suggest that
they walk a little further down the
King's Road to a different pub for
their pre-film drinks.
Yours sincerely,
Vivienne Watson

Rules OK
Dear Dave,
Can we use your letters column to
congratulate Dave Pugh on the
excellent way he organised
Carnival. We have been at this
College for several years and this
Carnival was the best organised.
Enough said.

Sweet
Freedom
Dear Dave
In reply to Chris Martin's letter
about 'Freedom of Speech' I would
like to set the record straight.
Freedom of speech in this country
means that you can say anything
you wish to, and even the various
laws which restrict those who
defame or incite are only a minute
and tiny dent on what can be said.
The NUS, he says, have a 'no-
platform' policy for 'the like of the
National Front'. The National
Front, however, are allowed public
meetings, candidatures for
parliament and even television party
political broadcasts, this clearly
demonstrates that the National
Front are not breaking any laws, so
it is perfectly possible to have
'Freedom of Speech' given to those
who would act (as they see it)
against various unwanted sections
of the British Society.
It is only by hearing their
repulsive policies that we can put
ourselves in a viable position to
attack and negate their arguments.
Equally, there is no restriction (at
least in public.although it of course
doesn't apply to the NUS) on public
sexism—just look at the Church of
England. I hope people have seen
through the weak link in Chris
Martin's letter between the terms
racist and sexist, and the reference at
the beginning to freedom of speech.
It is perfectly legal therefore to be
racist and sexist in public and
society has decided that it is better to
hear and destroy, rather than
'certain views should not be
expressed in public!'
Freedom of speech does not
belong to the oppressed, or the
oppressors, but to all.

Chairman IC ConSoc
Mr John
Martin
Dear FELIX,
I seem to have stirred up a
hornet's nest with a comment that I
was not aware that I had made. My
first inkling was when Dave Jones
showed me a letter from Jonathon
Davies implying that John Martin is
considering legal action against me
for calling him a homosexual.
I certainly did not do so; I have no
idea whether Mr Martin is gay or
not and, what is more, I could not
care less. Making comments about
someone else's sexuality is a childish
and offensive ploy to which I hope I
shall never stoop. What I
meant—and I thought I said—was
the Mr Martin has never been
harassed for being gay, regardless of
whether he is or not. If my wording
was misleading I apologise; I still
believe that my meaning was quite
clear. The sweet irony of this
overwhealming over reaction is that
my comment arose from Mr
Martin's objections to an article in
which I bemoaned the existence of
homophobia in Imperial College, a
place where the term "homosexual"
is considered to be an insult.
Yours,
Christine Taig
Jones
vs Jones
I am writing to ask whether you
are willing to confirm or deny that
you allowed Mr. Don Ferguson,
Student Services Officer, to censor
the last edition of FELIX, which
contained two articles of direct
concern to him (Hamlet Havoc and
Bringing The House Down). If the
reply is to be in the affirmative,
could I further ask if there is to be a
general policy for FELIX to allow
College officials to censor stories
and if so if there is any point
whatsoever in passing news items to
the FELIX office if they contain
anything which may be of the
slightest embarrassment to any
College employee.
Yours faithfully,
Ray Jones
Editor's Note,
No member of College is ever
allowed to censor FELIX articles. I
will occassionally permit people to
read the proofs before FELIXgoes to
press, but any changes they advise
may be rejected. Don Ferguson did
not read either of the stories
mentioned above before FELIX was
printed. If the tone or content of
either article seems biased in his
favour, it is because we are only able
to print as news information which we
have been given "on the record'. All
such information is gratefully
received.
