Guilds Float Home
The annual inter-CCU raft race,
Imperial's version of the Americas
Cup,took place on Sunday amid
claims that Guilds Union had used a
raft almost identical to that used by
RCS last year, with some form of
espionage being used to obtain
details of the innovative 'winged
keel' design. The competition
began in Prince's Gardens, with the
teams having to carry their rafts to
the Serpentine and then racing
across it. Guilds and RCS arrived at
the water together, although the
shocking pink of the Guilds raft
caused a number of horses to bolt on
the way. The aquatic section was
then begun, with the Guilds raft
arriving at the opposite shore a clear
first, followed by the RCS.
Also held on Sunday was another
competion between the CCUs, a
three-way tug-of-war. Initially the
RSM team pulled with RCS, and the
Guilds team looked obviously
outclassed. However, in a dramatic
change in allegiences the miners
switched sides, and pulled with
Guilds. The match became a
stalemate, with the RCS holding
firm against the other two teams,
until everyone lost interest and went
for a drink in Southside bar.
Physics Firsts Hit Graduate
Competition
A first-year lecture in Physics was
subject to a mass 'hit' on Tuesday
morning. The flanning took place
during the course of the lecture and
because of a large amount of
shaving foam left on the desks and
seats the following class was very
poorly attended.
The hit has been condemned by
all College authorities and students
have been warned that hit squads
may be refused entry to lecture
theatres. Entry to lectures is not
allowed without special dispen-
sation, although in the past this rule
has not been enforced. Guilds
Presdident Duncan Royle has taken
a firm stand on the flanning of the
first year physics lecture :'The
contract (raising £50 for rag) was
taken out by the mining first year
Christine Taig, President of IC
Union, has written to senior College
and Government officials to protest
at a move by the Iraqi Embassy to
obtain detailed information on Iraqi
students studying in the UK.
The embassy has written to many
college registries in the U K
demanding information about all
Iraqi privately-funded students, and
detailing the embassy's plan to
control the transfer of funds to those
students from families and other
sponsors.
The latest move by the Iraqi
and some of them were allowed to
take part in the hit. The Hit Squad
should not enter lecture theatres
without special permission and to
ensure adherance to this the Hit
Squad organiser, Chris Simpson of
Chem Eng II was present. Due to
circumstances beyond his control
(namely mining first year) the
lecture was actually interrupted. We
totally condemn this action.'
To prevent similar occurances the
hit squad have said they will only
accept contracts on individuals, not
whole departments. A spokesflan
stressed that the Squad disapproved
of unofficial hits, victimisation, use
of substances other than shaving
foam, and squads who fail to clear
up.
Embassy comes after a history of
heavy-handed surveillance of Iraqi
students studying in the U K ,
especially those who are thought to
be opposed to the ruling Ba'ath
Party, and members of the Iraqi
Student Society.
It is alleged that Iraqi students
have been subjected to physical
attacks by the National Union of
Iraqi Students and Youth (NUISY),
which has been banned by most
student unions in the UK and by the
National Union of Students.
IC students graduating in July next
year will be competing for higher
salaries than ever before, especially
those who are planning to go into
accountancy.
Accountancy firm Arthur Young
will be offering graduates starting
salaries of £11,000 a year for its
September 1987 intake, and the 80
candidates accepted will be able to
apply to do a masters degree in
business administration (MBA) at
the firm's expense.
This compares with the £9,000
expected to be on offer from the
other accountancy firms, such as
Coopers and Lybrand and Ernst
and Whinney. And these firms are
not expected to offer the
inducement of an MBA.
The move by Arthur Young
comes in the face of increasing
difficulty in attracting high-calibre
graduates to accountancy.
According to the firm, accountancy
is often seen as a fall-back career, if
all else fails. But their salary hike
looks set to put an end to that.
But for the real high flyers,
potential salaries are even higher.
Since deregulation in the City, the
'Big Bang', stockbrokers are
offering as much as £20,000 to new
graduates, big bucks by any
standards.
It is estimated that at least 10% of
IC graduates end up as accountancy
trainees. But fall-out rates are
notoriously high, with many
trainees failing the Institute of
Chartered Accountants' tough
exams.
Broken Glass
A cleaner in the Physics Department
has been seriously injured by broken
glass while disposing of waste paper.
As he was pushing the paper down
into the rubbish skip a broken glass
photographic plate severed an
artery in his wrist.
Terence Parker, Administrator in
the department, has circulated a
letter in the Department asking
people to ensure that glass and
sharp waste is separately disposed-
of.
IC Arrests
Three students were arrested when
they used replica machine guns to
stage a water fight in front of the
Iraqi Embassy on Wednesday.
A diplomatic policeman saw the
students, guns in hand, leap into a
car, performing a U-turn in Prince
Consort Road, and speeding down
Exhibition Road.
The car was flagged down by a
police motorbike and surrounded
by ten armed diplomatic police. The
students were frisked at gunpoint,
handcuffed, and taken to Chelsea
police station where they were
detained for an hour.
One of the students, a Mehanical
Engineering second year, says, 'We
all kept very calm but if someone in
the car had panicked I would hate to
think what might have happened.'
New Busses
An experimental minibus service
which can be used to travel between
South Kensington underground
Station and the Huxley Building has
been started by London Regional
Transport. The service, route CI,
runs from High Street Kensington
to Westminster passing Imperial on
the way. Underground Travelcards
give free travel on this service which
runs at intervals of 6 minutes.
Mary Returns
Mary, the mascot of Queen Mary
College, was returned to its owners
yesterday after three years in the
custody of RCSU.
The handover was made by
RCSU in return for the bell from
Jezebel, the RCS fire engine, which
was stolen on Sunday 9 November.
The exchange took place near
Liverpool Street Station.
A set of minibus wheels, which
were removed from an ICU van by
QMC students two years ago, were
also returned to RCSU.
