FELIX FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 12
Christine's Piece
What Junior Common Room?
Elsewhere in this FELIX you will
read about College's change of
plans for the JCR in the Sherfield
building. This is a controversial
move on the part of College. The
JCR, which is currently controlled
by the Union for the benefit of
students, will effectively become a
dining area for most of the time,
thereby reducing its potential as a
meetings and events room, and as a
money spinner during conferences
and exhibitions. This comes at a
time when the Botany-Zoology
common room has been lost, the
FELIX Office has been moved into
the only piece of available space in
the Union Building, and Union
Rooms are heavily oversubscribed
by clubs and societies. All this to
produce more refectory space even
though the Southside refectory is
undergoing massive refurbishment
this year in order to attract several
hundred students. On the other
hand perhaps more and more
refectory areas are what is wanted,
but should the Union be prepared to
lose effective control of its one large
function room? Do look at these
plans; come to the Union Office if
you've any questions or ideas—the
more comments we get, the better.
Probably the Best Carnival in the
World
Yet more effusive thanks to
everyone who organised the Guilds
Carnival. It's the first time I've ever
seen the floors mopped before all the
P.A. gear had been taken
out...seriously, it was a wonderful
night, smooth-running and great
fun. The only problem was the poor
turn-out—where were you??? The
time has now come to re-think the
whole concept of the Guilds
Carnival. If a high quality, good
value charity event like this can't
attract the numbers, it's a great
shame; maybe Guilds shouldn't
waste all the effort next year.
Dragging on...
I was going to write this entire article
about the merits of dressing up in
drag, but they told me it would ruin
my image. I wouldn't have thought
it could get much worse, but
however...
Assuming you're still in one piece
after the excesses of the Beer
Festival and the Smoking Concert,
see you at the 'Rag & Drag' disco
tonight. But will we recognise each
other? I shall continue my tradition
of going along with the prettiest
man there—and this year we're
going for the prize. Yes, this is a
challenge, a l l you closet
transvestites. (Well I always thought
being wild and wacky was what
going to college was all about..)
And Finally
I ought to apologise for the rapidly
deteriorating quality of these
FELIX bits. How Dave goes on
producing deep and meaningful
editorials every week is a mystery to
me. Ah well, only five weeks until
Christmas. I bet you're not looking
forward to it as much as I am.

Women's day at 170
'To talk to. anyone at Imperial
College, you need an appointment.
But people are too busy to seeyou. So
I haven't talked to anyone... not since
I arrived in August.'
"This is the first real conversation
Tve had in London... I didn't know
there were so many women at
Imperial'
Eighty two women and one man
arrived at 170 Queensgate last
Wednesdayfor the all day workshop
designedfor new arrivals throughout
the College.
In the morning 'talk-shop' groups.
dispersed all over the Rector'sflat to
discuss Tm bored Mum! Where can
we go?', '999 casualty! What happens
when you get there', 'Citizen's Advice
Bureau: When do you need one?' and
'London Black Tie and other
invitation rituals'. Clare Ash
investigated what PG students and
visiting academics were paying for
accommodation and what action was
needed. Dot Griffiths gave an inside
view about shopping in Oxford
Street; Shirley Sargent and Audrey
Grant did a run down on 'How to get
the best out of Sainsburys'. Marion

Anderson, Gerry Levitt and Sally
Grootenhuis told everyone in the
dining room about 'How to Help
London' by volunteering to run stalls
and hospital shops, supporting
Cancer research and the National
Trust.
At 2.30 there were a seies of
workshops led by PG students geared
to survival on a shoestring.
An invited guest, Connie Parker
from International Student House,
briefed us on what was on offerfor all
London students and Christine Taig
led an animated discussion on 'How
to Stay Safe Although Out Alone at
Night'.
The day's organizers were elated
We made a small leapforward in the
communication game. Yet there were
a lot of new arrivals we didn't reach.
Next year we'll have a better
invitation list! If you missed the day
and would like to have the handouts,
write to the Women's Club at 170
Queensgate and we'll send you our
combined wisdom. We're also
recruiting talent who will help turn it
into a handbook. Offers to the same
address.

Dear People,
From now on (ie. 18th Nov.)
Union Cards will only be made in
the Union Office on Tuesdays,
between the hours of 2pm. and 4pm.
The still large numbers of you who
haven't got cards, have less chance
of getting them now. Perhaps you
should have come when we were
paying people to do them, and not
just when it suits you.
