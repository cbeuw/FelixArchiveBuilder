Phoenix Centenary. .1886198a
Next week
marks the
centenary of
the oldest
publication at
Imperial
College, the
Phoenix. To
mark the
occasion a
programme of
events has
been
organised,
with lectures,
parties,
dinners, and,
perhaps most
importantly, a
careers
seminarfor
students who
wish to
become
journalists. By

Edwards and

H G Wells and
the early history
In December 1886, Herbert
George Wells founded the
Science Schools Journal. In
1890 it became the Royal
College of Science Magazine
and in 1904, the Phoenix. This
fateful decision, to call it the
Phoenix, has set the character
of the magazine's history ever
since. It has been destined to
die occasionally during its 100
years, only to rise again,
gloriously, from the ashes.
H G Wells was editor for
the first four issues. He
contributed regularly until
1893, and made his final
contribution, an appreciation
of Huxley, in 1901.
Time Machine
Wells is best remembered
today for his works of science
fiction. Among his novels,
'The Time Machine' is one of
the best known. It was
published by Heinemann at
the end of May 1895, but this
classic story has a very
interesting history behind it.
Three different drafts were
p u b l i s h e d before the
Heinemann edition, and the
first of these appeared in 1888
in the Science Schools Journal
under the title 'The Chronic
Argonauts'.
Wells later came to regret
the publication of this early
draft, which appeared in three
installments: some years later
he bought copies of the
journal containing his work
and destroyed them.
"Fortunately he did not lay
his hands on the copies which
are now in the possession of
Imperial College Archives
and contain all of his nine
contributions," says Steve
Marshall, editor oi Phoenix in
1980.
Marshall published 'The
Chronic Argonauts' in its
entirety for the first time in
1980, together with new
illustrations by Paul Williams.
Strike threat
On the occasion of the
Phoenix's Diamond Jubilee in
1946, some wag looked to the
future and contributed a
'report', taken from the Times
of 10 November 1986:
The students of the Imperial
College of Science and
Technology were concerned
yesterday in a scene
reminiscent of the days of
"ragging" of the violent 1940s.
They claimed that their
working hours did not leave
time for attendance at the
Lectures of the Professional
Institutions and at Scientific
Discussions, these activities
being, of course, the main
relaxation of the college.
Consequently, it has been
decided to strike for the 80-
hour week.
The author was clearly
confident that the Times
would still be going in 1986:1
wonder if they were as
confident that the Phoenix
would also have survived.
But the author in 1946
could have known nothing of
FELIX: that didn't appear
until December 1949. Its
appearance was to change the
nature of the Phoenix
profoundly. From being a
magazine containing college
news as well as literary works,
it has gradually shed the
former role as FELIX has
matured. Originally published
several times a term, Phoenix
now appears only once a year.
But Phoenix and FELIX,
originally in competition, now
complement one another. •

Scientists
can't write
Despite the efforts of Phoenix
editors throughout the 100
years of its history, people still
criticise scientists for their
inability to write. Someone
who knows more about this
problem than most is John
Maddox, editor of Nature
magazine. Every week he
handles hundreds of papers
submitted by scientists who
hope to have their papers
included in the prestigious
journal. And although the
science may be good, the
English is often difficult to
read, unclear and ambiguous.
"What is the problem?"
you may ask. Scientists are
employed to "do" science not
to write about it. But a
brilliant idea or discovery is
useless unless it can be
communicated to others, both
fellow scientists and lay
people.
John Maddox feels strongly
about the subject, and so his
lecture on Tuesday, provoc-
atively entitled 'Scientists
cannot write to save their
lives', promises to be
entertaining and thought
provoking.
The lecture takes place on
Tuesday 25 November at
12.45pm in the Read lecture
theatre, Sherfield. To get to
the Read theatre, take the lift
to the level five of the
Sherfield Building. Admission
is free.
This lecture has been
organised jointly by Phoenix
and the Imperial College
Department of Humanit-
ies. •
Free
careers
seminar
for
budding
writers
Inspired by John Maddox's
lecture on Tuesday, thous-
ands of IC students will
doubtless be eager to become
journalists. The careers
seminar on journalism on
Wednesday 26 November is
conveniently timed for these
budding writers.
The seminar, which is free,
will take place in Mech Eng
220 at 1.00pm.
Among those taking part
will be ex-IC students who
have made their career in
journalism. Also present will
be:
•Shiona Llewellyn, an IC
careers adviser who used to be
managing editor of Radio
Times and Time Out — she
will talk about the business of
journalism, and career
prospects;
•Wynford Hicks, a freelance
journalist who also lectures in
journalism at the London
College of Printing;
•Nina Hall, science corres-
pondent of the Times Higher
Education Supplement, soon
to become science editor of
New Scientist — she will deal
with science journalism in
particular.
But the emphasis of the
seminar will be on the
audience — so feel free to
come prepared with a long list
of questions if you wish.
Remember that there are
l i t e r a l l y thousands of
magazines and newspapers in
the U K , and many of them
carry scientific material: they
need science graduates who
can write. But there is no need
to feel constrained to science
journalism: one IC graduate
works for Socialist Worker,
another is Belfast corres-
pondent for Hot Press, the
Irish music paper; and
another works for an occult
magazine.
Coming to the careers
seminar doesn't guarantee
you a job in journalism — but
it will explain some of the
pitfalls to avoid, and may give
leads that you can follow
up. •

Back to the
future: the next
100 years
This time next week, the
Centenary Phoenix will be on
sale, but already preparations
will have to begin for the next
issue. The magazine has
changed a long way from its
original format envisaged by
H G Wells in 1886. Originally
intended for treatises and
diatribes on scientific matters,
bearing the banner of 'no
articles of a light-hearted
nature to be submitted', it
soon became transformed
into a form more creative than
logical.
R e c e n t l y , after its
ressurection in 1980, Phoenix
has become an annual
occurence, but now we are
hoping to make it more
frequent — at least one each
term. But this can only be
achieved if you write articles
or submit artwork. Articles
need not be short stories or
poetry; there is always scope
for satire and comedy,-
features and critiques. Also,
just because we are at a science
college there is no need to
avoid talking about science
'out of hours' in Phoenix —
but having said that, don't
write up your latest problem
sheet. The stranger a subject
is, the more likely it is to be
interesting.
Submissions should be sent
to the Phoenix editor, at the
FELIX Office, as soon as
possible.
