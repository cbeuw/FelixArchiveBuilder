College Sit Tight On
JCR Changeover
IC Union is unlikely to be able to
persuade College administration to
go ahead with the switch of the Main
Dining Hall and the JCR.
Union representatives met senior
College officials on Monday to
discuss the reorganistion of the
refurbishment plans. The new
proposals are that the SCR should
be partitioned, and used in part as
an eating area for the 'QT' snack bar
which was opened just before the
start of term. This section of the
room will be retained for Union use
after 5.00pm.
College Deputy Secretary Brian
Lloyd Davies said that the refectory
system was a 'victim of its own
Trolleys To Be
Banned From
College
John Smith, the College Secretary,
has sent our a noice warning that
departments using supermarket
trolleys to transport goods within
College will be disciplined.
Following complaints from
neighbours annoyed at the clutter of
trolleys as well as from local
supermarket managers, Heads of
Departments and Administrative
Sections are asked to assess their
transport needs and buy suitable
trolleys from their equipment grant.
The policy comes into effect from
January lst and action will be taken
against the supervisor of any staff-
member using a supermarket trolley
on College premises after this date.
Assistant Secretary Michael
Arthur pointed out that not ony is
the practice of taking supermarket
trolleys illegal, but it is important to
keep on good terms with the
neighbours so that they do not block
further expansion.
success' explaining that there were
not enough seats to accommodate
demand. He said that there was a
severe bottleneck in all catering
areas between 1pm and 2pm, when
the majority of people took lunch.
He quoted several significant
increases in numbers using
refectories since 1984, including a
figure of 117% for the JCR services.
This is largely because of the
introduction of the 'QT' snack bar
in the JCR, though trading at other
outlets has also increased
substantially.
Mr Lloyd Davies went on to say
that the 'QT' snack bar had
originally been envisaged as a take-

away service, and that its turnover
had exceeded all expectations. In
acting now, he said, the College was
trying to cope with the problem at
the outset.
ICU Hon Sec David Colley
questioned whether the use of the
JCR as an eating area could not
have been foreseen, and described
the College's new scheme as 'sneaky
and underhand'. He thought that
the College seemed to have gained
some of the Union's space by going
ahead with the development of the
snack bar and then shelving the
changeover plans.
Mr Lloyd Davies said that the
refectory issue ought to be treated as
a 'community problem', and
accepted that the Union Snack Bar
was also suffering from space
shortage because of high demand at
lunch times.
According to the University
Grants Committee (UGC), Imperial
College has sufficient space set aside
for refectory and student service
uses for a college of 6,500. The
current student population of IC is
just under 5,000. The U G C also
considers Imperial to be over-
provided with lecture theatre space.
Internal Services Officer Alan Rose
commented that this had not
prevented the Biology Department
from taking over Union rooms.

prevented them from buying other

brisk bidding from others with

of the slaves themselves. About 300
