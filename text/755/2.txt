Letters FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 2
Great
Expectations
Dear Sir,
I find the attitude of certain
student bodies towards the new
Education Act (which requires each
Institution of Higher Education to
ensure Freedom of Speech) quite
incredible. If you believe that the
presence of speakers will influence
peoples' views then you must also
believe that a highly active Union
Executive can influence peoples'
views. Now since many unions up
and down the country are affiliated
to the NUS, which is run by the
National Organisation of Labour
Students (NOLS) then you see this
has very interesting consequences.
Who then finally decides the range
of speakers allowed into a College?
Ultimately NUS and NOLS.
Now the NUS has in the past
managed to gain credibility by
ostensively supporting minority
viewpoints, while systematically
disabling the democratic apparatus
to oppose such views. Remember
Lots of
Bickering
I would like to complain about
some of the semi-intelligent tripe
that has appeared in your pages
recently. Obviously some of your
correspondents are so obsessed with
promoting their causes that they
have no time to think about their
arguments.
Firstly the puerile bickering
between the rabid right (John
Martin, Colin Trotman etc.) and the
trendy left (Christine Taig, Chris
Martin etc.) over the freedom of
sneech/no platform argument. Do
these fools not realise that the
Education and Public Order Bills
are merely legitimate political tools
employed by the government to
impose their views on sections of the
public? It is not a question of the
rights and wrongs, it is a question of
who has the power to implement
their schemes. Frankly it looks like
we're going to have to accept that we
will have loans instead of grants, we
will be obliged to adjust our views
on the acceptability of speakers and
on the acceptability of social
practices to fit those of the elected
powers. You cannot just expect
democracy or automatic rights, any
examination of the British political
system will show you that the
accepted practice in this country is
that a party has to win one argument
(eg. an election) and is then given the
right to automatically decide all the
others. Then again perhaps that is
the way these people are arguing.
Furthermore I am appalled by the
hipocrisy of RCS. Of course when a
bunch of mindless vandals from
though, the NUS is run by NOLS
and the executive of socialist
principles is the prime objective.
Of course this is a gradual process
and as Chris Martin (DoC) pointed
out in the last FELIX—"The NUS
are well aware of the dangers of
extending the definitions more
widely, which would result in the
(no platform) policy having no
credibility at all." However, in the
short term there is a solution—
'debating' principles.
The NUS are rightly scared that
the new Education Act will halt
their long term plans by removing
their veto on opposition views.
Since you cannot possibly oppose
"Freedom of Speech" without being
exposed, the recent G U C as
Christine Taig pointed out, actually
discussed "the principle of the govt,
interfering directly with student
unions...". Very emotive language
and I suppose it keeps interest
ticking over.
Maybe next time they will discuss
"the right of men to have babies" to
galvanise the gay vote.

QMC nick the bell from Jez it is
theft. But what is it when RCS hacks
nick street signs and hang them in
their office? Why is it that RCS get
to decide the laws pertaining to
theft, and why is it that their rules of
mascotry are automatically
extended to QMC without anyone
consulting QMC. It's a bit like
throwing a ball at someone in the
street and complaining its not
cricket when they don't bat it back.
For three years QMC have been a
pain in the backside nicking stuff to
ransom back Mary, its about time
someone gave the thing back and
stamped on all this idiocy.

Peace in
our time
Dear Sir,
How the worms crawl out of the
woodwork! Cannot Messrs.
Wooding and Wells (FELIX 754)
fathom the intellectual argument
that they can only trade personal
insults for informed comment?
For the benefit of new readers,
David Wooding's tactic of repeating
my name exactly five times in a letter
is an old one, used by his cronies last
year, and reinforced with a pseudo-
quotation. A phrase which the
'honourable' David Wooding finds
funny, is attributed implicitly and
dishonestly to myself. The idea of
the whole ploy is to anger the victim.
Try growing up Mr. Wooding,
your style, along with the dregs of an
argument are pathetic and
laughable.

Rant
Dear Sir,
In last week's FELIX, Stephen
Blanchard asks why students should
be penalised for entering higher
education by having to pay for
themselves in the form of student
loans. If all the students in all the
universities & polytechnics around
the country were totally committed
to their courses I would agree with
him entirely. However, a large
number of students, even at
Imperial, seem to come into higher
education as a way of putting off
career decisions. This is not in itself
a bad thing, but some obviously
would have been better served by
looking more carefully at the
options available to them, which is
what student loans would force
people to do.
If this causes a drop in numbers of
students by causing them to take
more suitable options at 6th form
level, then some departments and
maybe universities may have to
close, but this would merely serve to
weed out the less productive ones.
Just to set the record straight Mr.
Wooding and Mr. Weller, let me
reiterate the sentiments of my first
letter: It is, in my opinion, cowardly
and dishonest to distribute leaflets
with no name on, however, I can
understand that if you have so few
principles you may not want to
stand by them. Perhaps more
important is the fact that nobody
could question the authors of the
literature, and nobody could
question the authors of the
literature, and nobody could assess
their bias. Moreover, I was given a
leaflet whilst talking to the REME
recruitment officer. He said that the
thing which narked him most, was
that they were not allowed to reply
to them: I appreciate that the right
of reply is something you guys
would like to see the back of as well.
Since you both seem keen to
diversify into peace politics rather
than the real issue of my letter, let
me put my bit in. Peace won't come
as you seem to suggest if you throw
down your arms, wave a bit of paper
and shout 'Peace in our Time'. Your
peace seems to be precariously
balanced somewhere between
instability and downright disaster.
Also deserving comment is the
contemptuous insolence of Andrew
Weller who seems to have made an
estimation of my 'literary
appreciation' from reading my'
letter. Keep taking the pills
sunshine. I assure you that I am
quite cool enough without that ice
and water to make an unprejudiced
decision on Barclays involvement in
South Africa. So was the attendance
of the last IC U G M . The lies of your,
letter have been forwarded to
Barclays PLC for their inspection.
The final absurdity of last week's
FELIX: how the hell does Ms Taig
No department or university has a
divine right to exist, and there are
people who regard universities and
polytechnics as being full of people
who don't pull their weight (for
instance there was a letter in my
local paper, just before the
beginning of term, which talked
about "gross overspending" in
universities and "dross in the
university system"—purely, so it
seemed, because the letter-writer's
son had been accepted by a
university having only achieved
"mediocre" grades).
It is to be hoped that this
increased pressure on departments
would cause the courses to be more
industrially orientated, since the
outside world seems to be crying out
for graduates who are actually of
some use. This is not to say that all
courses that do not have a practical
use should be abolished (perhaps
not even the one run by the
Professor at Cambridge who
specialises in 10 dead Iranian
languages), just that those that aim
to be practical should be more
aware of the needs of industry.
Yours sincerely,
Dave Hamilton

translate 'some people like to
explore their own sexuality' into
'supposed or actual homo-
sexuality'? I am not a gay. And how
exactly can students take a
democratic decision to exclude
other students from the democratic
process? It sounds like you have
more empathy with Joe Stalin than
Joe Student, Christine. How about
starting to use a little 'supposed or
actual' intelligence?
Yours sincerely,
John Martin
Sincerest
Gratitude
Dear Sir,
May I make use of the letters page
of FELIX to thank all those people
who helped run the Guilds Carnival
last Friday. Their enthusiasm and
sheer hard work were of an order
seldom encountered at an IC event
and so to the many Guildsmen and
women whom I was unable to thank
in person on the evening, may I say
that all your hard work into the
small hours did not go unnoticed. In
particular I would like to thank all
the exec who took over much of the
work when the timetable had to be
adjusted, leaving me in a blind panic
suffering from a total loss of
organisation, and all the Links men
who put in such a sterling effort on
the Cocktail bar. Whilst the event
was not as well attended as I had
hoped, all the helpers made it what I
hope was a good night for those who
did attend. My sincerest gratitude to
you all,
David Pugh
