Felix FELIX, Friday November 21st 1986 3
Residences
Since the rape in Hamlet Gardens
earlier this term, IC's accommod-
ation and security problems have
attracted public attention fairly
consistently. Few of the issues raised
are new, however. Security in student
residences is lax, and some rooms are
poorly maintained This is not
because College in unconcerned, but
because it is not a sufficiently high
priority when it comes to tha
allocation of funds. Until a serious
criminal incident occurs, together
with all the bad publicity this entails,
Sherfield is happy to let students cope
with shabby accommodation, because
it is not seen as an importantfactor in
dissuading students from coming to
College. The collapse of a roof in
Holbein House, which quite
conceiveably could have resulted in a
fatality, was met with a pitiful lack of
concern. If IC Union can achieve
anything this year, it should hammer
home that the state and number of
student residences are unacceptable.
I understand that measures may be
taken to divide the role of the Student
Services office, so that the ambigious
position of welfare organisation and
rent collector are resolved If so, I
applaud the changes; one can only
wonder why such a scheme was not
adopted a year ago.
Rag
Rag Week is now in its closing stages,
and, from what I have heard, thisyear
has been very successful financially.
It is a little sad that the party-type
events, such as the Beer Festival
receive most support from students,
whereas the number of "direct
collecting" events are gettingfewer. I
would urge all those who have
attended and enjoyed any of the Rag
Week events so far this week to
attend the VSO collection tomorrow,
and persuade the general public to
support the Rag charities.
Letters Page
I am very please that so many
people shouldfeel moved to write to
FELIX(we have not been able toprint
all the letters this week). At the same
time, I have been quite amazed by
some the correspondance. If infuture
we receive as large a postbag as this
week's I am going to be considerably
more selective in choosing which
letters should be printed This may
upset a number ofpeople who seem to
take thattitude that FELIX shoudl
guarantee topublish their scribblings.
Some of the letters I have received
have no purpose other than to
introduce the authors name. These
will not be included; if
correspondence is nothing more than
apersonal attack and a repeatition of
some stale argument then I shall
simply forward it to the person or
persons for whom it is intended.
FELIX
I am still very pleased to meet
anyone who is vaguely interested in
contributing to FELIX. I appreciate
comments that the paper has been a
little dull recently, and this issue is
particulalry thin. I can best improve
FELIX is there is a wider input of
ideas to the paper and I shall be
delighted to receive new ideas for
articles.
