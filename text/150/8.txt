The Sailing Club had enquiries-from a
bout 100 freshers at the reception, and
hopes to have about 50 f u l l y paid up me
mbers_ this year.
The term has started well,with helm-
smans tests, instruction f o r beginners, and
some keen racing i n the f i r s t University
A aridB points races, i n which we gained
1st,2nd Vth,and 2nd and 3rd places res-
pectively.
In answer to the unhappy article r e l -
ating the bedevilled sailing experiences
of the Editor' of Felix,a committee has
persuaded him to give the art one more
try i n the near future. We are convinced
that the experience w i l l make a deep imp-
ression on him,and we hope to publish a
f u l l report with photographs i n a later
Felix.
We have also challenged the B 5 ruggei
team to a rugger match, to demonstrate
our superior fitness or otherwise.
It ha3 been suggested that the S a i l -
ing Club should form a swimming sub-
section,as so many members Seem keen to
make closer contact with the Harp. While
saling i n a promising position i n the
ivelsh Harp open meeting on Sunday, the
vice-Commodore suddenly performed a neat
backward r o l l into the water. He was
later seen swimming after his notorious
orange boat and popsy crew. (The popsy
crew i s not yet notorious or orange.)
