A purely scientific college tends>t»
the production of graduates with seme
scientific knowledge, an over- develop
ed faculty for destructive oritioism,
and often a narrow, ignorant state of
mind as regards non-scientific matters.
One of the purposes of the Union ii.
to t r y to turn destructive critioism i n
to constructive and to endeavor to educ-i
ate the student, i n matters ither than
s c i e n t i f i c . Unfortunately the tendenoy
to destructive c r i t i c i s m i n this
•college i s , i f anything, gaining. One
may hear, i n the style of Bernard Levin
destructive c r i t i c i s m of, aay,"FelixJ
"Phoenix", a club ctffiolaj.!or:a, Unjoa

i a t i o n of the amount of work l^volvedu
You oan r e l l s e the situation more
fully i f you oheok your reaotions to
this artiole. They w i l l probably be,
something of"the nature of 'The Stupid
Idiot'; instead- of forgetting; the* person
involved and considering seriously
the points the artiole raises.
.The Debating Society i s very much
affected by this attitude. At Orfprff
and Cambridge, these two provincial
universities, the Debating Society i s
the Union, whereas here the scientists
relegate i t to the level of a society
for those who l i k e talking. Yfhen a
motion i s announced for debate, they, ,
say, 'What-a ridiouloua motion'; instead
of' .considering the.-arguia*ri>s;thoy
cKsraiss i t without serious -thought.
When I.C. students come to a debate
they l i s t e n to the main ar>a%':ars and
when the debate iB open to,s$he house
they refuse to speak, due to t h e i r fear
of being devoured by howls of derision
from the"Bectroyera".
The Debating Society at I.C. i s open t o
a l l members of the Union; anybody may
suggest, i n writing, a motion. I f I . C ,
is to beoome a better balanced community,
xt i s going t o produce scientists
who are not just boffins, then suoh soc-
ieties as the Debating iiooiety oust be
supported. Students must come along,
l i s t e n oareful^yt? arguments and then
speak forth on t h e i r opinions froa the •
floor. If this starts to happen, a more
oonstruotiye society ' i l l b?gin to em-
erge and the College w i l l flourish as V

November 6th;. and the Brighton Run
are fast approaching and Bo' w i l l , as
usual, be amongst the Veteran cars lee.v
ing Hyde Park i n the early hours of the
morning.
Boanerges, the o f f i c i a l carriage of
the President of City and Guilds, i s a
1902 James and Brown 5-seater Phaeton.
Last year Bo suffered a crack in one of
h i s cylinders and reached Brighton only
with the-eid of the several strong
Guildsmen'who made up h i s crew and jump
ed out a t every slight upgrade to add
their power to h i s . During the past six
months , however, Bo has undergone an
extensive overhaul and i t i s expected
that he w i l l reach Brighton with no mis
haps.
I hope that as many Guildsmen as poss-
ible w i l l be i n Hyde Park to give him a
good send off and those who d i s l i k e
r i s i n g early on Sunday mornings w i l l be
on Brighton promenade to cheer him on
h i s a r r i v a l there. After the run a luno
heon w i l l be held at Olarges Hotel,
Brighton, organised by ths'C- & G otor
Club.
Amongst Bo's other outings thiL*.terra
he w i l l v i s i t Putney on I.Iorphy Day and
w i l l lead Guildsmen to cheer the n
