Suddenly, i t ' s The Jazz Consortii-n!
This cosmic group went into orbit i n tht
top chophouse of Imperial College last
Saturday. Man, they blew l i k e they were
in the Galaxy K81 i n Ursa Major. (Like,
dig the extended astronomical metaphor,

several light years before the squares dig
this sort of 3olid noise. Components of
the Consortium are: Dick iadraore(tpt.),
Walter Skinner(alto), Kichard Bushton(piano)-,
Frenetic Farnsworth(bass), Mike Smith(drums),

so funky. I mean,he has certainly gotten

A student i n London has one big ad-
vantage over his provincial counterpart,
and that is' that London offers a large
number of theatres,two opera hou3es,two
resident ballet companies and two large
concert h a l l s with nightly concerts of
both classical and more modern music
However i t i s am«?i1ng how many students
f a i l to make use of these almost u n r i v a l l -
ed opportunities;so to encourage- them the
following notes have been compiled. This
week's a r t i c l e i s devoted to opera,but i t
i s hoped i n later numbers to mention the
theatre,ballet and forthcoming concerts.
The opera season opened on Oct.19th
.fith a gala performance of "La Somnabula?
This seldom heard I t a l i a n opera i s sdde-
l i g h t f u l work and the veteran I t a l i a n con-
ductor Serafin contrived,with Miss. Joan
Sutherland and the rest of the cast,to
make this performance a great success.

two very well known operas are really

company did the music f u l l justice.

The published programme includes
future performances of these three pp*-
eras,as well as revivals of "Peter Grimes"
"Carmen" (in EnijLish)Il Barbiere d i Sivig-
lia"and "Macbeth" (both i n Italian)and "Der
Rosenkavalier'(in German}
Among other revivals to date,probably
one of the most successful i s "La Cener-
entolla";Rossini's gay,fairytale opera
being well-suited to the intimate at-
mosphere at Sadler's Wells.Once again the
English translation helps to put aoross
the inherent wit and charm of this piece
i n which Denis Dowling i s particularly
successful as "Dandini",repeating the
performance he gave at Glyndebournethis
year.
At Sadler's Weils,the season started
somewhat earlier with a new production of
"La Traviata".As with a l l performances at
this theatre,it i s sung i n English and so
provides an excellent opportunity f o r the
newoomer to opera to familiarize himself
with the music.- and plot without having
to contend with Italian dialogue.
