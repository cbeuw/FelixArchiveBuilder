RUGBY
For the f i r s t time i n the Club we had
eight teams out for the f i r s t matches at
the season, unfortunately a l l these had
to be cancelled because of Folio. The
matches w i l l start again on October 29th
when the club has a very strong fixture
with Hosslyn Park. We hope that the spirit
and interest i n the olub w i l l not die
down because of the break. By the time
this i s published two films w i l l have
been shown to members. One i s the Offio
i a l Rugby Union Instructional film whioh
has how to be brought up to date. The
second i s one of the A l l Blacks' tours.
With beer and sausage r o l l s to follow
this cannot f a i l as a successful evening.

Dear S i r ,
In view of the di3cus3ions now
under way as to what sports f a c i l i t i e s
there should be i n Prince'3 Gardens,
I thought that your eea«tpra-"might be
interested i n the following report I
received from Mike Barber(ex RCS) now
doing research at Yale.
"Perhaps the olub would be interested
in knowing a l i t t l e about the f a c i l i t i e s
at Yale. In Newhaven i t s e l f there i s a
huge gymnasium that houses just about
everything,three swinging pools,one an
Olympic pool,the other two seperated
by a moveable barrier so that the sizes
can be altered at w i l l ! >
Around these pools i s a board run-
ning track. The temperature of this room
i s maintained at 70 Degrees F. and the
humidity at JO^.There are 15 squash oourts
gyms,and boxing f a c i l i t i e s and a tank
for the oarsmen with a pump to simulate
f a s t and slow-moving rivera'in either d i r -
ection,wave-maker3,wind-makers and sun
lamps.
Out at the sport f i e l d two miles from
the camrus i s an American football 3tadium
seating 77,000 and a baseball stadium
(seats 15,006). There i s a f i r s t class
running track with two 220 yds. straights.
This i s connected by a tunnel under the
main road to the locker house and an
indoor 220 yds. cinder track. Air-condit-
ioned f a c i l i t i e s exist for a l l f i e l d events.
There are also soccer,rugby, hockey crick-
et(?)pitches,basketball courts and an i c e -
rink.
'The college has i t s wn golf oourso,
where the cross-country races are also
held;the l a t t e r over three laps of a h i l l y
one and a half miles,the record being 2}:17
Free transport and medical f a c i l i t i e s are
also provided."
Unfortunately,as a post-doctoral stud-
ent,Mike cannot represent his collage
and make f u l l use of a l l the f a c i l i t i e s
provided.
Yours Faithfully,
J.L. Collins.
