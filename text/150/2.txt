The New Physios blooK was opened on
October 20th. by S i r John .Cookroft. A
large crowd of distinguished people gat
hered i n the main Physios lecture theat
re to hear S i r John, introduced by the
Viscount Falmouth, and the Rector, give
the opening address. His description of
the electrical apparatus which producei
a large current, poking through a hole
i n the wall, f o r one of Professor Black
ett's expf^imenisj • was very well reoeiv
ea .

_ replir,. Processor 'SSeokett paid
tribute to S i r John, and saying that.
S i r John was the'best s c i e n t i f i c admin
istrator i n England today.
Sir John then oalled'upon modern
technology to aid him. in unveiling the
large block of stone above the entrance
In spite of the rain, a large number orS
people watched the ceremony from across
the road. After the opening, the assemb
led company wandered around the block,
examining laboratories and apparatus.
A l l agreed that everything was well app
ointed, and, so far, no major grumbles
have been heard. It seems as though
Professor Blaokett's praise of the arch
iteots and contractors is well deserved

Historians or f i l m producers, wish-
ing to recapture the atmosphere of We^l
ington's tent en the eve of Waterloo,
cr Montgomery' s\>aravan before^ Alatnein
would have been well advised to eaven;
drop on a military conference held ill
an upper room of Beit H a l l i l a t e on the
eve'of the opening of the JJbysios block
For this was the f i n a l bwtefing before
Operation Toadstoo 1.
The reason for the Operation was
simple. Several users of the new Physic
block had noted i n horror that a number
of iron toadstools had been planted
just outside the building, i n Queen's
Gate, but had been painted as mushrooms
They could only be toadstools, however,
being obviously unfit for human con-
sumption. So i t mas decided to restore
them to their proper species by paint-
ing a variety of colour ed spots a l l
over them.
The atmosphere was tense i n tne
briefing room as the reconnaisance
patrol l a i d down their cups of coffee
and set forth. While they were taking
up their positions to guard against
the blue-uniformed enemy, a F i f t h Col-
um, consisting of twfc of the prettiest
g i r l s available (both- alas- engaged),
entered the building i t s e l f and engaged
the night watchman i n charming convers-
ation. Meanwhile, the Operation proper
got under way. Armed with brushes, pots
and "stencils" (pieces of card-board
with round holes i n them), a commando
group gained access to the mushrooms
by a secret route and completed the mux
ation into to-tdstools at lightning
speed. Having retired, they deoidecrw
paint the'concrete pots as well, just
to match. Withdrawal of a l l parties was
eompjaKed without any casualties, excep
t a few paint covered hands and clothes
and i n fact, without any slrn . f enery
activity. Kopping-up operations we e un
dertaken with a mugful of petrol.
Obsessed by the Scientist's love of
symmetry, sone of the raiding party tho
ught i t intolerable that the other end
of Prince Consort Road should remain m
decorated. Their a r t i s t i r talents
turned to the statues outside the Royal
School of Mines. Theseweatherworn f i g -
ures now blossom forth i n resplendent •
masculinity or languorous seductiveness
I t i s rumoured that a stony smile has at
last sprecd across the l i p s of Beit and
Wernher, and that the belles of the R.C
M., pranoir-g primly down the street i n
the morning with their music cases, are
,half-oonsoious of a roving yellow-
painted eye that appears to follow them
as they go*
Nor did Guilds escape. Artistry,
was somewhat exhausted by than-ther e
are not any statues outside Guilds anyw
ay- but theredid at least appear seme
indication that R.C,S. painters had
been there.
The raiders' one regret i s that
they were not able to correct some of
the equations on the since unveiled
slab, toj bring them into l i n e with the
information given on certain of their
own,exam, papers . However, i t w i l l a l l
be out of date before long.
The toadstools, incidently, rever
ted to mushrooms shortly before the
buildiflgrwas opened. Pity
