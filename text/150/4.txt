Vffl NEED TOTTERS. Every Editor .01
"Felix" has made this appeal. This Edit-
or i s no exception. Regular fortnightly
articles, occasional articles, any art
icles irilldo. A s i x page "Felix" i s not
a good reflection on the l i f e of the Un-
ion, and i f % of the College wrote one
artiole per fortnight, we should get 28
articles, enough to f i l l about' 9 pages.
I f you feel the need to burst into
print about lectures, the Union, women
or anything else, do so. Immediately.

Dear S i r ,
I t has been my misfortune to
eat another meal in. Ayrton Hall. Of the
food,the- catering staff and the general
setting I have no complaints,but the an-
imals that were.also eating have provided
yet another example of why the youth of
the country i s ao widely condemned today.
Provision of cloakroom f a c i l i t i e s has
been made i n the building, together with
a h a l l porter to take oars of articles
deposited therein. Either i t i s the hab-
i t of the I.C. animals to throw brown
bags, duffle-ooats,and other garments a l l
over the tables from whieh they eat at
home,or dare I suggest that the I.C.anim-
als do not possess tables at their homes,
to say f a r less of hooks and cloakrooms.
This i s by no means the f i r s t occasion oh
whioh suoh squalor has been endured, to '
make i t possible to eat an early meal at
I.C.;in f a c t i t occurs in. Ayrton H a l l
every evening.
May I therefore suggest an addition to
the "oulturs" programmes-that of a course
entitled "Elementary Etiquette"or "Manners
Maketh Man",so that these 1.0. animals may
have the opportunity of becoming gentlemen,

We have recieved the following l e t t e r
from George Bacynski,who l e f t last year
with a degree i n Chemical Engineering and
i s now doing a postgraduate course at Per-
due University.
Dear Jim,
Since I've only been here about
tbr«e weeks,I shouldn't i n a l l fairness,
try and draw any conclusion from what I've
experienced of University l i f e on this
side of the Atlantic.
What I s h a l l do f i r s t of all,then,is
to describe Purdue University to you,and
then give you my f i r s t impressions of the
place.(I warn you,though,that I disclaim,
any responsibility f o r any legal proceed*,
ings r i s i n g out of the contents, of these
letters,and that i n the event of ay being
subpoenal by the Senate Investigation Sub-
Committee,I expect Felix to pay for the
best lawyer I oan get.)Well,here goes!
Purdue University i s located i n the
township of West Lafayette,across, the
Wabash r i v e r from the parent town of l e f -
ayette,and about 120 miles south of Chic-
ago. The University i s situated ekcaocam-
juiA^approximately 360 acres i n area,but
the 70 or so main (educational) buildings
are concentrated i n a s t r i p l A m i l e wide
and! mile long. The remaining 200 acres
are devoted principally to halls of res-
idence f o r students, and recreational.' fac-
i l i t i e s ,
Perdue i s a large University by English
standards, although i t i s ranked only 15th
i n size i n the States.It has about 20,000
students of whioh^abbut 1/j are post grad-
uates. The main f i e l d s of specialisation,
roughly i n order of importance,'are:-
Science and Engineering, Agriculture,
Education and the Humanities,and Home Ec-
onomics.
Now that I've set the soene,I'd. better
give some idea of what i t ' s l i k e to be at
Perdue. In the f i r s t place,I was struck by
the. size, London University i s so spread
out that i t i s very d i f f i c u l t to vsualise
i t as a whole. Here everything i s concent-
rated i n a small area, and as you look •
around a l l you can see(or so i t seetasj i s
row after row of very large four or f i v e
ajtory red-brick .buildings. Perdue bss,o6.
course,ope important advantage over Lon-
don i n that,being compact,there i s no
wasteful duplication of f a c i l i t i e s , a n d
one large building about the size of the
Hoderic H i l l building,is usually sufficient
to hold a complete department.
The second thing I noticed was the inf-
ormality of the relationship between staff
and students. For example,a few days ago
the s t a f f of the Chemical Engineering dep-
artment invited new graduate students to
a p i c n i c ( I should say, i n passing,that pio-
nioing(?)is every popular weekend pastime
i n the 3tates,but i t has been so oommerot-
aliaed that i t bears l i t t l e resemblance to
pieniolrig i n England,apart frEm the fact
that one eats out of doors.) After the
meal,the staff challenged the students to
a game of softball(a cross between base-
b a l l and rounders.)That they got soundly
fceateh i n the end was due mostly to the
shortness of breath rather than a saakt-
o#3skillband they were on l e v e l terms,
for most of the game thanks to some fine
pitching by the head of the department,
whose curving deliveries were very hard to
h i t . I oouldn't imagine this sort of thins,
happening'at Imperial College^or any other
English Bniversity and i n many;ways I
think i t ' s a pity because everyone enjoyed
themselves,and i t broke the ice i n no un-
certain manner.
F i n a l l y I suppose I'd better say someth-
ing about Perdue traditions. These are
many and varied,and are always-being thrust
down our throats(when I say "ours" I'm inc-
luding myself among the Freshmen.). I had
heard i t said quite often that Americans
were ooncioua of Itheir lack of traditions,
but i t wasn't u n t i l I got here thet I r e a l -
ised f u l l y what was meant. They have many
traditions over here,but,although everyone
goes through the motions,one gets the im-
pression that their-traditions are slight-
l y ridiculous,and that they are slightly
ashamed of themselves f o r going through
the motions but that they are taking cour-
age i n numoers.Now I'm not a rabid nation-
alist,and I'm w i l l i n g to admit that many
English traditions are now s l i g h t l y r i d i c -
ulous. The b i g difference i s that very few
English traditions started out by being
ridiculous from the very moment of their
inception.
Well,I've opened my mouth,and I.'.ve put
ary foot i n i t up to the knee, so I think
t h i s would be a good point to f i n i s h .
A l l the best!
George Bacynski.
Dear S i r ,
May I, through the colu/ms of your
paper, enquire i f anyaejjhers of I.C.
would be interested in forming an Qrni>
thologioal Society within the college.
Many universities i n the countrv have
made valuable contributions to the un-
derstanding of bird behaviour. I feel
that Imperial College oould well pro-
vide s u f f i c i e n t people of energetic and
s c i e n t i f i c disposition to do the same.
The w t i v i t i e s of such a society
would involve lectures, films and demon
strations, with a considerable amount
of outdoor f i e l d work. Such f i e l d work
could include surveys, trapping and r i r
ging and the study of specialised top-
ics. Such a c t i v i t i e s could even be arr-
anged on an expedition scale.
Contact would be established with
other societies i n this oountry and ab-
road, and the publication of reports
jphuld-further- our interests, and one
w^-uld hope, reputation.
I f anyone i s interested i n such a
.aociety would they contact me v i a the
Union Rack, i n order to co-ordinate e f f
orts and henoe resort to the usual off
i o i a l channels.
lours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r ,
there must surely come a time
when a man having passed his prime and the
inevitable quiet shadows of the l u l l after
the storm appear,looks at the mirror and
says to himself " I have had my say,done
my b i t , l e t the young new members take
over."This man would remember the pathetic
pioture of an elder statesman jeeringly
rejected by the youngsters who grew tired
of that interference that so annoyed him
earlier. Some suoh are amongst us,having
served u . p o l i t i c a l and sporting court
jesters "for many years ana last year" very
ably as chairmen of the various committees.
One oan only hope that the discrimination
that comes with the years w i l l allay the
likelihood of an unnecessarily distaste-
f u l experience. Please Sirs,thank you" we
say,but please put your pens i n your poe-
i-ets and leave i t to us.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
A.Hall.
Dear S i r ,
I am writing to correct an error
i n the article on the SCO,which appeared
i n your last edition. The Christian Union
does not require i t s members to accept' ten
points of doctrine. One beoocies a member
on agreeing to a three point declaration
of belief,which i s acceptable to members
of a l l Christian denominations. Although
we have a membership,non-members are
warmly weloomed at any of our meetings.
We should be glad i f you would be so
kind as to publish this letter i n order
to correct any false impression that may
have been given.
Yours Faithfully,
Martin Atkins
President.I.C.C.U.
