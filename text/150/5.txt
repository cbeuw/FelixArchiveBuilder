The f i r s t meeting of the SCO was held
onOotober 17th.and at this meeting Mr,
Brian Ford was elected Hon.Sec.
A report was given of the SCC Executive
ooamxttee meeting which covered four main
points. F i r s t , i t was noted that Council
had requested the student officers of the
SCC to investigate the problems of ove»-
seas students. Second, the question of the
obscuring of notice boards by the cloak-
room doors was referred to the Bouse
Committee. Third,olubs were asked to make
more intelligent use of the internal not—
iceboard. Lastly, i t was agreed that orders
for engraving pots 'should go v i a the Chair-
man of the SCC to the trophy officer.
jar.KaoHierson.representing the Debating
Society,stated that Council had placed the
society i n the ECC. He thought that the
major a c t i v i t i e s of the society were dis-
cussing,arguing and debating of religious,
philosophical and p o l i t i c a l issues and
that,therefore,the Debating society was
more «Hn to the SCC clubs than the ECC
club3.lt was also more convenient i f the
Efcaaidentoof dBebaees could attend the SCC
meetings In order to contact speakers for'
debates,The fact that i f the Dab.Soo. were
in the SCC i t would be the only one award-
ing colours was dismissed as t r i v i a l . A
request that the Chairman at. the SCC ask
Council to reverse i t s previous deoision
was carried,neirucon.
The date of the next SCC meeting was
fixed as Nov.21st,junior treasurers were,
reminded to collect their account books
from Dr.Owen,and volunteers were obtained
to decorate the pavilion at Harlington
on Nov.5th.
Clubs were reminded of the Onion rule
against distributing literature i n the
refeotories.
CluBs-were -aske4 not to arranmt meet-
ings on Nov. 15 tli as there would os, a
Union Meeting oh that day. Some dlsaatis£
faction waa expressed that t h i s date had
not been announced earlier..
A suggestion was made that olubs be
allowed the use of the oollege internal
postal system.
Overseas Students.
On Thursday,Oct,20th,the SCC officers
met Mr.Taylor of the registry and the
Presidents of the International Relations
Club,the Indian,Pakistani and Arab societ-
ies to discuss the problems of overseas
students. Mr. and Mrs. Cox and Mr.Ng Wing
Kong were also present i n advisory capac-
i t i e s . The discussion lasted several hours
and the main points are summarised below.
* 1) The Hector's Sunve-jia showed that a
large proportion of overseas students f e l t
that the Union was not diving enough f o r
them.
2) British students,though rarely pred-
judioed against coloured students,are too
reserved or elae too patronising i n their
relations with them,and overseas students
want,above a l l else,normal genuine friend-
ship.
3) Some overseas students are al30 at
fault i n that they are looking f o r colour
prejudioe and ascribe too many- of" the
vicissitudes of everyday l i f e to this
cause and rebuff attempts at friendliness
on the part of B r i t i s h students.
if) There i s nothing the Union oan do
to combat colour, prejudice outside c o l l
ege where the coloured student i s most
l i k e l y to f i n d i t .
5) -Admitting a l l .eolelBwsd tAsfienta ,%a:
hostel or running a •l&Ssri&)^'\WXjt& am
their behalf .although aWVmwjmwxTae,
presents great practical di«Tlaultiesi
6) The organisation of" fresners'reo-
eptions and dinners for overseas studentr
would accentuate their uneasiness rather
than relieve i t .
71 The President of the International
VIEWPOINT
Despite well-meant attempts to damp
down controversy,it appears that dis-
cussion of important Union matters has
continued unabated. The Rover orew have
recently voted 12-11 against wearing tro-
users «t one of the most heated meetings
yet helm a t I.C. Soon, the Socialist Soc-
iety w i l l be the government at an I.C,
mock Parliament, and w i l l be led as Prime
Minister by the. only pro-Saitakellite i n
the society. The Debating Society,placed
against i t s w i l l i n the Recreational Clubs
Committee,have received unexpected support
from the Social Club-* Committee whioh.
decided unan-uaously to ask for the returs
of the Debating Society to the S.C.C.
The publication of the deliberations
of Council i n F e l i x was a welcome improve
ement on previous practice but may I go a
step further by mentioning issues not yet
decided?Cbuncil have rightly'' l e f t the
decision o
n
.
-
. • the destination, of this year*
carnival proceeds to the I. C.Executive Co-
mi t tee. We certainly should try to avoid
an annual controversy on this matter.
Might X suggest,however,that any member
of the Union with strong views on this
subject, see members of the Executive Xu
advance? This should ensure that the
decision this year i s not completely at
variance with the wishes of Union memb-
ers,even i f unsatisfied customers s t i l l
exist.
Anotner issue to be decided soon,this
time by Counoil, i s whether ttev-^£>n-aeab-
ers should have to pay f o r casual use of
the tennis courts. The present practice
in a l l other sports la' that a membership
Tee Is charged by a l l oluDs and t h i s
fee e n t i t l e s the member to the use of
the appropiate f a c i l i t i e s . The situate
ion i s a l i t t l e different f o r the tennis
courts(and squash presumably)where a very
high proportion of the users of the courts
may only play one or two games per year.
It has been suggested that the tennis
courts should be considered as a rec-
reational f a c i l i t y of the Union just like
the television room o r the Union lounge
and that no charge should be made for tne
hire of the courts. The regular users of
the courts would become members of the
tennis club in the usual manner.
The contrary viewpoint,expressed i n
the preliminary discussion on Council,
i s that the tennis courts,like the boat-
house etc.,may be useful sources of
income to the Union and should be ignored.
The point was also made that casual users
of the o-siujts might act.-, more responsibly
i f they had had to pay for the priyilegi
and that., i n axr/ case She sum i n question
(tOs max.per annum)was not excessive by
any standard. The issue i s due to be dec-
ided at the next meeting of Council.
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.
.Relations Club said he did not think
his club had organised enough meetings
for overseas atudents recently,and pro-
mised to r e c t i f y the situation.
8) Formal club meetings However,did
not really meet the desire of overseas
students f o r personal contact with B r i t i s h
students, and the idea was ccnoeived of
appointing sympathetic and enthusiastic
Unionmembers to be "contactera"ie. to
arrange small informal gatherings of B r i t -
ish and overseas students at intervals
I throughout the year .This scheme' s t i l l
requires more attention to d e t a i l but
seems to present some chance of meeting
I the current dissatisfaction of. overseas
students.

T H E * W O R L D O F A R T
Practically everyone i n the English
book reading society i s awaiting with
baited breath the result of the Crown vs
Penguin Books case. The most used word i n
the language at the moment appears to be
unexpurgated. LADY CHATTEBLEY'S LOVER,
always a sensation,has now reaohed over-
whelming heights of notoriety. Lawrence
w i l l soon be as famous as Shakespeare,ar<l
yet we may never be able to read this
famous(infamous?) book.
There i s a big weakness somewhere when
a legal system c a l l s upon twelve ordinary
people with absolutely no l i t e r a r y qual-
ifications whatsoever to judge whether or
not a book by a very able writer should,t
or should not be placed on the bookstalls
for everyone to buy and read.
Surely a much more r e a l i s t i c approach
would be to appoint a committee of, say,
qualified writers, o r i t i o s and readers to
judge suoh a work.
Let us hope,anyway,that the case goes
to Penguin Books giving us the opportunity
to judge f o r ourselves.
Muriel Sparke has just produced another
book c a l l e d "The Baohelors."(price 16/-)
Dissapointingly,it f a l l s sadly short of
her previous book,that very successful and
amusing novel,"The Ballad of Peckham Eye."
In her latest attempt,she again chooses to
highlight a particular section of the Com-
munity; this time the bachelor society of
Kensington,Chelsea and Hampstead.
She never quite finds or keeps the
osphere of these d i s t r i c t s and this gives
the story rather a hollow ring, the per-
sonalities of a couple of the main char-
acters have been b u i l t up quite satisfac-
t o r i l y , but the secondary characters are
rather weak, due to only, one short descrip-
tion of each at the time of entry into the
action.
The plot of the novel centres round a
group of s p i r i t u a l i s t s and,particularly,
their medium,who i s on a charge of forgery
and fraudulent conversion. Intrigue sprouts
everywhere,even interupting the bachelors'
search f o r free love and meals.
The story i s s u f f i c i e n t l y involved to
hold the readers interest,but never quite
reaches the point where the reader cannot
put the book down. Miss Sparks l i v e l y s t y l -
r e l i e s mainly on dialogue,which i s both
witty and amusing,and never boring.However,
in this book she has not managed, to bring
the reader into the story and make him
really care what i s going to hflrpen. One
more or leas feels like a disinterested
outsider being told about friends of
friends.
On the whole,a rather dissapointing
follower to her previous book,but one well
worth reading,at least to the keen reader.
To finish,there are three interesting
Penguins published this month that are
worth buying.Two are by William Faulkner;
"INTEUDEE IN THE DUST."and "LIGHT IN AUGUST"
The f i r s t i s about the colour problem
in the southern states of America,and the
story i s treated as a t h r i l l e r with murder
and a lynch mob included. Intelligent and
exciting.
The second,a truly great novel,aaais
with the pride,lust,hatred and b r u t a l i t y
of a Calvinist society.
As a oontrast, "FUETHEB FABLES FOR OUR
TIME."by James Thurber,for Thurberites
only.
