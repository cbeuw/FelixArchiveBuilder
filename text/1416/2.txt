Imperial Bioscientist
students win gold in
worldwide competition
An Imperial College team of nine un-
dergraduate bioscientists are celebrat-
ing this week after returning from the
International Genetically Engineered
Machines (iGEM) competition with
a gold medal and two additional top
prizes.
As reported last week, the team had
spent a week at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology competing
against the 84 other universities from
21 different counties, in the renown
undergraduate research synthetic biol-
ogy competition. They triumphantly
came home with the gold prize for
technical excellence, top prize for best
manufacturing-themed project, and
another for best new ‘part’; which re-
fers to Bacillus subtillis bacteria used
in the project.)
Professor Richard Kitney, a Professor
of the Imperial team gauged the inter-
national achievement they attained,
saying “Our team has performed bril-
liantly and it’s fantastic that we did so
well when faced with competition from
other leading university teams from
the UK and around the world.”
The four-month project involved
a team of nine undergraduates from
Life Sciences and Bioengineering, four
advisors and two professors with the
concept of turning harmless bacteria,
Bacillus subtilis into efficient biofab-
ricators. The hope is that the bacteria
will be able to produce self-assembling
organic compounds, such as cellulose,
on demand, and in a pre-meditated
pattern.
The application behind the team’s
winning concept will go onto aid many
industrial procedures, from recon-
structive surgery to the manufacture
of eco-clothing. Professor Paul Free-
mont, another of the team’s advis-
ing Professors had great hope for the
future of the biofabricator, saying the
team’s hard work “sets up other engi-
neers and life scientists from around
the world to use this harmless bacteria
as a chassis for other synthetic biology
applications.”
Undergraduates Erika Cule (Bio-
chemistry 3rd Year), James Chappell
(Biochemistry 3rd Year), Tom Adie
(Biology 3rd Year) and Chris Hirst (Bi-
otechnology 3rd Year), Krupa Hirani,
Yanis Djinnit, Clinton Goh, Qin Qi,
and Prudence Wing-Yan Wong (all
Bioengineering Various Years) will all
now return back to the day-to-day pro-
ceedings of College life.

New laws introduced by the govern-
ment as part of the Climate Change Bill
shortly to receive Royal Assent, allow
the Government to charge for bin col-
lections. This charge, called a stealth
tax by critics will increase further the
cost of living for students.
Groups that are exempt from council
tax, students the most prominent ex-
ample, will not be exempt from the so
called “bin taxes”. Government guid-
ance documents state that “a particular
example might be households of stu-
dents” as a group which is exempt from
council tax but not the bin tax.
However there is also significant
leeway for local authorities to exempt
groups who do not pay council tax
from the new bin tax, stating “authori-
ties must take account of those groups
who might be unduly disadvantaged as
a result of the introduction of an incen-
tive scheme”.
Eric Pickles MP, Shadow Secretary of
State for Communities & Local Gov-
New stealth tax
increases cost of
living for students

ernment, said:
“This is a second hit on students, just
days after the Government’s decision
to cut student grants. Gordon Brown’s
bin taxes will punish not just family
homes, but any household with a large
group of people. Labour Ministers
are so obsessed with picking people’s
pockets that they now want to raid stu-
dents’ wallets. These new stealth taxes
will increase the cost of living for cash-
strapped students and student nurses,
who are already struggling to pay their
way.”
If the proposals were unpalatable as
they stand, Labour Deputy Leader of
the House of Commons has said that
MPs will be exempt, with taxpayers’
picking up their tab.
The cross-party Communities & Lo-
cal Government Select Committee has
slammed the Government’s plans for
new bin taxes:
“We repeat what we said six months
ago: it is hard to see why any council
will want to set up a complicated charg-
ing scheme that earns it no money and
risks widespread public disapproval”
Remember those happy days when bins were free?

New postgraduate and
international positions to
be created in Council
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
Union Council Chair, Afonso Campos
came under the spotlight after certain
accusations on Live! that he was not
acting appropriately. After clarifying
the previous meeting’s minutes on
Council and on Live! the situation was
resolved without a hitch.
After Council Chair made his points,
there were three main agendas to be
resolved firstly there was the bi-elec-
tion to elect ordinary members for the
faculty unions, which, rather unsur-
prisingly were all filled, apart for the
Royal College of Science Union seat.
The other two agendas covered the
creation of two new seats on Council.
The first of the two papers to be dis-
cussed was the creation of a new Inter-
national Student Officer. Council had
to vote on amendments to the paper
first, and decide whether or not all stu-
dents could stand for the positions, or
whether it would only be international
students. Before any of this could be
decided, Council first had to agree
upon the definition of international
students. It was decided that interna-
tional students would be all those stu-
dents outside of the United Kingdom.
This included the Channel Islands,
who College consider as International
students and thus pay the full fee.
The second amendment to the paper
was deciding whether or not all stu-
dents should be allowed to vote. Alex
Grisman, who is the Academic Affairs
Officer (Taught) for City and Guilds
College Union, made the point that
the role would only effect international
students and that therefore only inter-
national students should be eligible to
vote. This turned out to be the case
and the motion was passed.
The second paper presented by Dep-
uty President (Education & Welfare)
Hannah Theodorou, looked for a re-
shuffle of postgraduate positions. Miss
Theodorou felt that the current rep-
resentation of postgraduate students
was ineffective. The paper suggested
removing the current postgraduate po-
sitions from the faculties and placing it
into the Graduate School Association
(GSA), which would cover both taught
and untaught postgraduates.
Again the question of representa-
tion came into question as it was dis-
covered that any postgraduate could
stand for the various positions. Other
Council members commented on the
fact that this method is the best solu-
tion in the current situation, although
some disagreed.
Both of these two new roles will be
effective immediately.

Conservatives see 50% target
as unrealistic

The government’s approach to univer-
sity expansion is like “trying to drive a
car with the accelerator and brake both
pressed to the floor”, says Tory univer-
sities secretary, David Willetts.
Willett’sremarkwasmadeinaspeech
at the University of Kent last week,
at a time when the Higher Education
Funding Council for England (Hefce)
wrote to all universities asking them
to ‘review their planned recruitment
for 2009/10,’ warning there will be no
funding for extra university places in
2010/11. Although 10,000 additional
student places were to be financed for
2009/10, those numbers have already
been allocated to universities since
January 2008. This means that univer-
sity places will be capped for the next
two academic years.
Willett’s went on to say: “In 1999,
the government promised to get 50%
of young people to university by 2010.
It is a scandal that the figure remains
below 40% and, for men, the chances
of reaching university are actually go-
ing downwards.”
“It is absurd to have a target for 50
per cent participation and specifically
to prohibit universities from meeting
it.”
Although Labour committed itself
long ago to sending half of all young
people to university by 2010, the uni-
versity participation rate for young
people has only risen by 0.6% since
1999-2000 and stands at 39.8%.
The Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s (OECD)
annual evaluation of different educa-
tion systems shows that the UK has
slipped from 4th to 12th in the interna-
tional league table for the proportion
of young people going to university.
One of the countries overtaking the
UK is Poland. In 1990, Poland sent one
in eight of its young people to univer-
sity, however, today it sends one in two.
So while the UK will undershoot the
50% target, Poland has already hit it.
Government’s aim of widening uni-
versity participation may also be ham-
pered by its recently discovered £200m
funding shortfall. This prompted the
universities secretary, John Denham,
to announce Labour’s u-turn on pro-
posals to offer grants to students with a
household income of less than £60,000.
This has now been reduced to £50,020.
This decrease in the limit is expected
to affect some 40,000 students starting
university next year.
Last week university think tank Mil-
lion warned that restricting student
numbers risked damaging widen-
ing participation, particularly among
under-represented groups. A wide-
ranging review of the higher education
funding system is being called for, in
particular costs and benefits of univer-
sity expansion.
