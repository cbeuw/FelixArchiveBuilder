Virgo
Whilst the relaxed
status between you
and your supervisor/
housemate/bit of
stuff has suited you
well up to now,
things are about to change. You need to sit
down and address both of you expectations
of the relationship now, because if unresolved
differences in your desires will go on to
become a major source of anguish between
you. Stop it before it advances like Hitler.
Scorpio
Well, well, well.
Things are certainly
looking up for you
on the old romance
front this week. It
seems holding out
for that special person is paying off, so take it
slow and enjoy the ‘getting to know each other’
stage, safe in the knowledge the ‘can’t keep
your hands off each other’ stage is just around
the corner.
Libra
You may think your
friends are interfer-
ing busybodies and
that is because they
are. However it’s
nice to know that at
least they are interfering busybodies with your
best interests at heart. So when a close friend
this week sets you up with someone unex-
pected, go with it. Some words that may come
in handy; Może kupuję wam napój?
Sagittarius
This week you need
to address your
work life balance. If
you’ve been slacking
off now is the time
for some productive
study, but if you’re part of the majority of Im-
perial students and working far too hard then
you need to take some much needed me time.
So go on, cancel tonight’s intensive study ses-
sion and get out on the town with your mates.
Vomit everywhere- it’ll be fun.
Capricorn
Variety may be the
spice of life, but it is
also a known cause
of Chlamydia. You
are super attractive
to the opposite
sex just now, so enjoy it while it lasts –
responsibly. Things will settle down soon and
when they do you may be surprised to find
a relationship that started as a bit of fun has
further to go than you imagined. Pint?
Cancer
Whilst your mate
thinks this week’s
antics are just more
harmless fun, you
think this time
they’ve overstepped
the mark. You may not like conflict but things
won’t be the same between you until you
say something. So bite the bullet, fight it out
and make up over a couple of drinks or be
prepared to loose a great friend.
Gemini
You may feel like
you’re snowed
under and have
no time for social
activities this
week but a friend
is counting on you to support them at an
important event. Do not let them down unless
you are prepared to spend the rest of the
term earning their forgiveness. If all else fails,
you’ll have to buy it, but last time I checked
forgiveness couldn’t be bought in Morrisons.
Leo
Things for you
have been going
swimmingly of late,
so why not pass
the good fortune
on to someone
else? You’re full of ideas and inspiration at the
moment which could really benefit someone
close to you, so ask around and find out who is
looking for a new muse. They may deny your
help, but don’t let up.
Taurus
So you did some-
thing stupid, but
don’t worry, the
stars indicate now
is an ideal time
for all Taureans to
learn from previous mistakes. Thankfully, this
week’s embarrassment will only last until next
Wednesday when the collective social memory
of the sports teams is eradicated by copious
amounts of Snaky B.
Aries
New discoveries
last week forced you
to reconsider your
plans. The change
was unexpected and
unwelcome, but the
good news is that a new direction will bring
surprising benefits. Remember your friends
that got you through the bad week with cake
and tea/beer, they may need your help with
their own problems soon.
Pisces
Caution is advised
this week, as what
seems like a good
idea at the time
could have dire
repercussions (think
Phil Collins on drums) especially if copious
amounts of beer are involved. If you attract the
attention of shady men in pubs, a swift exit is
probably necessary. Remember guys: “women
and alcohol can be a lot of fun, but if you mix
them, it can turn you into a dumbass.”
Harrowscopes. Or Horoscopes if you prefer.
Aquarius
Wise words for
you this week; Nil
Sine Labore (for
non latin speakers,
nothing without
effort). You know
what you want but sitting around is not going
to get it for you. However if you’re prepared to
put in the groundwork you could be reaping
rewards as early as next Tuesday. (Only whilst
stocks last though).
Apparently Horoscopes need to be more helpful and less... ‘made up bollocks’. Here goes:
FUCWIT
League Table
Right then, the Felix University/College-Wide Invitational Tourna-
ment League is officially back, and it’s about time we explain what
the hell is going on.

lenges, and at the end of the year, the winning team will win an iPod

toshop Competition, Caption Competition and Quick Crossword. 4
points for second, 3 points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point
for fifth.

Solution 1,415
Winners of last weeks Quickie were
Top of the Table, they were straight
in there... bang, not bothered, next
please. These guys are quickly getting
a monopoly on the puzzles section,
we must break this. I suggest getting
your felix, having a Quickie and
sending it in. Laters.

The winner of Slitherlink 1,415 was
Top of the Table. Again. Seriously you
are becoming repeat offenders. I’m
getting bored of you... a pint may make
me less bored though...
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
WHA...DA...FUH? Competition
is stiffer than when ‘a mate’ sees
Polish girl. The first answer took
less than 15 minutes to bounce
onto my screen cutting my ____
short! Anyways winners were
Top of the Table who found
“SHORTDICK” hidden there.
W
ednesday evening
was unseasonably
warm, so I decided
to make use of the
pleasure cruiser
my second husband bought for me
while we were courting. A little moon-
bathing went down a treat, I was relax-
ing with a glass of champagne, when a
number of young men from the Kings
College Hockey Club came by on one
of their community integration eve-
nings. This year they were putting on
a travelling performance to entertain
the locals.
Not to be out-done by some kids
putting on a show, I decided to put on
a show of my own, thrashing my best
pole-dancing moves out around the
mast.
Clearly things were getting a little
out of hand, so we laughed it off and I
offered them some of my champagne.
Unfortunately, I had run out of glasses
and so they threw their’s over for me to
fill. Have you ever seen those guys try-
ing to aim (might explain why they’re
doing rather badly this year)? Anyway,
their aim is about as bad as an RSM girl
and they ended up giving their glasses
to some of my neighbours instead.
Initially this caused some confusion,
but thankfully it was laughed off by
everyone and no one was offended.
In other news, I’ve recently discov-
ered the wonderful Boujis for the first
time! I was glad to see so many young
things following my advice on finding
themselves a rich husband, the compe-
tition was a little unnerving though. I
was reminded that I’m not getting any
younger and really must get a move
on if I want to find that illusive fourth
husband!
Apparently it’s been a very good
week for all of you too, as only one per-
son has sent me their problems:
Dear Tamara,
I recently cooked a delicious meal for
my boyfriend and his parents, the only
trouble is, the duck I cooked was one of
my favourites from his farm, we called
him Donald and everything! As deli-
cious as the meal was, I now can’t face
the thought of meat and am considering
becoming vegetarian in memory of my
beloved Donald.
I’m worried my boyfriend won’t un-
derstand as he says my cooking has been
getting better, he’s even stopped going to
McDonalds for a top-up afterwards!
What should I do?
Quacked off
Dear Quacked off,
I can’t believe you’re considering
subjecting your boyfriend to a life of
no meat! It would be one thing if you
stopped eating meat and just ate the
veg you cooked to go with his main
meal (meat is very calorific anyway),
but to deprive a man of his meat is ask-
ing for trouble! You need to be a good
woman and ignore your own feelings
in order to make him happy.
If you have similar feelings in the
future, I suggest you counteract the
negative karma by cooking a big roast
dinner. Shame on you!

Caption time! -1
To help you waste time in lectures (if
you want to that is, we’re not going to
come after you with a machine gun)
we now have a caption competition. I
can literally hear the exclamations of
joy from here. However had to get the
editor so drunk that he went home
with a man to allow this; so use it
wisely- he knocked a hole in £50.
To the rules: 1) You make me laugh
you get five points in the FUCWIT
league. 2) Send captions to sudoku.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, bonus laughs
for placement of caption (so scan it if
possible).
3) Make them funny.
This week we have unlucky Brit James Toseland bailing if from his Tech3
Yamaha M1 MotoGp bike.... Epic Fail!! Now you get captionating.
