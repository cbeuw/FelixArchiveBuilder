After your promotion last year to
BUCS South Premiership B, what
are your aims for the 1st team
this year?
Aim number 1, get massive; aim
number 2 beat some teams at rugby,
aim number 3 beat some teams at any
other sports going around.
Elaborating on aim 1, you said
get bigger, did you see this being
a problem before in the months
after you gained promoted?
We did, which is why we went and got
some gingsters pasties, sandwich shop
and piled on the tuna baguettes.
That definitely helped. One
of our guys put on 10kg
of pure fat during this
time.
After speak-
ing to some
members
of the
1st team
squad, it
became
apparent
that the
team
was
miss-
ing some players in
key positions, one
of them being prop
forwards. I’ve also
heard that the
Editor in Chief of
felix has decided
not to play this
year. What can
you say about
that?
Firstly I’d like
to say some-
thing about
the editor,
he’s obvious-
ly got com-
mitments
to the paper
which makes
sense. As far
as the 1st team
forwards and
props, you
don’t get many
smart people
that are mas-
sive. Normally
massive peo-
ple just sit in
front of the
telly eating
chips, they’re
not really ac-
tive or sporty.
Any props we
do get, we hold
onto and get
them straight
into the gym.
We tell them
stuff like maybe don’t eat two pasties,
maybe eat just the one and then a pro-
tein shake, and maybe go to the gym in
between.
Moving on to the club as a whole,
if I’m not mistaken, your 2nd
XV also got promoted last year.
Where do you see them going
this year?
I think they’ll be well established in
their league, but I don’t see them get-
ting promoted just yet. They’ve been
winning their home games and get-
ting good results away. But as far as the
league goes, they probably won’t go up
this season.
What are you realistic targets this
season then?
We need to secure ourselves in the
league first. Our aim at the start of the
season was to come 4th, and we believe
it is still attainable, but the work has
to be done and it has to be done now.
We’d also like to retain the Gutteridge
Cup, it’s a massive thing and can hold
20 pints, so that’s always a fun night
when you win that. Obviously Varsity
is a target as well, and we hope we can
give another spectacle this year.
Talking about Varsity, how did
you feel after last year’s result?
Devastated. But you have to realise
that if the medics had lost that game,
they would have felt worse. It was just
one of those 50/50 games and we came
out on bottom. It’s a problem we’ve
been having this season and something
we will have to turn around. It won’t
just happen over night, but we are get-
ting better and better every game and
it is just a matter of time before we get
it right.
Seeing as you are now one of the
‘elite’ teams at Imperial as you
are now in the premiership, what
support have you received from
Sport Imperial and/or the Union
to help maintain this level?
Sport Imperial have been great help,
they try their hardest to give us every-
thing we need as well as some of the
stuff we ask for. There have been times
where they haven’t been able to help,
probably because we asked for too
much, but they do try and meet us in
the middle. But yeah, they have gener-
ally been very good.
You’ve given us your predictions
for the 2nd team, let’s see what
you think about some of the other
teams. Firstly netball 1st team?
I hear they are having a hard time,
but those babes will sort it out in the
end. They’ve got those cute little pink
hoodies, they can’t lose with that can
they?
Hockey 1sts?
Men’s hockey 1sts, they’re doing
quite well aren’t they? They always
seem to be winning with a small mar-
gin though, 1-0, 2-1. I think they’ll be
fine this year.
Football 1sts?
Ask the captain - James Pettit
The run-up to Varsity begins. This week, Mustapher Botchway
interviews the Imperial College Rugby 1st XV Captain on their
current performance and about sport in general
Name: James ‘The Bear’ Pettit
Team: ICU 1st XV Rugby
Position: Flanker
Date of Birth: 16/10/1987
Hometown: Wisbech
Course: 3rd Year Physics
Height: 6ft
Weight: 93kg
Half Man, Half Bear. Some say that there is a legend
that James once missed a tackle, but we all know it’s
just a myth. James likes most things but there are a
few things he doesnt like, such as Portsmouth, Small
Pizzas and Medics, he especially dislikes Portsmouth
Medics.

Football are a mixed bag, they have
quite a lot of teams. They’re good at
drinking though, so socially they are
up there with the best. As far as BUCS,
I think they’ll end up staying where
they are.
Some of the less obvious sports
now. What about fencing?
They’ll go up, I remember that last
year they were quite good and they
seem to be doing the same again this
year.
What about squash?
They were really good last year.
Didn’t they win some BUCS thing too?
Yeah. I think they’ll do well again this
year.
What about Orienteering?
What is that?
It’s a sport where you have to
find targets in various environ-
ments in the quickest time.
So you’ve just got to be a normal hu-
man to do it. Good luck to them. Why
aren’t they playing rugby?
Just before we round up the
interview, we just like to ask you
about the social side of things.
As Jack and myself have pointed
out in the paper, it’s not just
always about the sport. With
that in mind, how do you balance
playing for the 1st XV, competing
week in week out and taking part
in the social side of the rugby
club?
We don’t stop anyone doing anything,
in fact we encourage the social side of
rugby. It is so important to bond with
your team mates, dress up as girls and
the ‘lash’. But we do say that if you miss
training because your out the night be-
fore, then we will come down on you.
It’s not just me on the case, the whole
team has got the same mentality as no
one wants to affect the training session
by not being there. But nobody really
does that as every is pretty committed
and everyone wants the same result.
Also this Saturday night there is a
cocktail event hosted by the club in
dB’s, cheap drinks and a good time.
All you got to do is bring those little
umbrellas.

Yes there is a snowboard team at IC, and it finally warrants a mention in felix!
There is a massive university
snowsports community in the UK,
of which Imperial is a relatively tiny
part of. Typically, clubs from Lough-
borough, Birmingham, Reading,
Manchester and even Dublin attend
national events with upwards of 30
members (the majority of which attend
purely for the rowdy social aspect of it
all) whereas Imperial are lucky to send
15 competitors. However, this number
is growing year by year along with the
team’s successes, prompting funding
from Sport Imperial enabling more
frequent coaching and more consistent
participation in events.
Last weekend saw Imperial’s snow-
board race team come 3rd overall
in the British University Dry slope
Championships (BUDS) Dual Slalom
event - a huge achievement amidst the
64 participating teams especially in the
first year that the competition has been
sanctioned by British Universities and
Colleges Sport. IC Snowsports race
team won 10 BUCS points for Imperial
in the sports league tables which is the
best success they have achieved yet.
In the individual competitions, Al-
lan Bouwstra and myself, Ruskin Con-
stant, were 37th and 41st fastest down
the boarders Grand Slalom course with
times of 16.80 secs and 16.93 secs re-
spectively - a formidable result against
182 total competitors that qualified us
for the Boarder X race competition the
following day.
Boarder X involves a much more dif-
ficult racecourse including jumps and
sharp turns against another rider at
the same time, similar to the Olympic
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
Ruskin Constant &
Michael Parkes
event that has 4 riders. It is stupidly
difficult even without having to worry
about another rider who is well within
the rules to ‘nudge’ you down. This led
to a number of casualties of which for-
tunately there was no one from Impe-
rial, but at least 3 hospitalities occurred
over the weekend on the slopes.
Last year, the snowboarding team
were knocked out in the first few
rounds due to an unfair mishap where
a race official was late in signalling for
our team to start. This year we were
out to prove that Imperial has got
some major riding talent despite hail-
ing from central London. The event
is often dominated by students from
Unis further north that have access
to more of the country’s dryslopes
for training or have a much bigger in-
vestment in sport (e.g. Loughborough
or Bath Uni.) Beating Newcastle rid-
ers was particularly satisfying for this
reason, especially considering we did
not even have enough people for a full
team (only 3 of the 5 that were needed)
in my first year.
BUDS freestyle competition plays
host to some major figures on the UK
snowboard scene; the likes of which
provoke other amateur snowriders to
attempt the craziest of stunts in order
to gain respect on the slopes. Despite
not being recognised by BUCS as an
official competition, freestyle still at-
tracts at least a 100 competitors each
time and this year was no exception.
There’s a Big Air contest (massive
jump with massive tricks) and a Slope-
style contest (big air plus rails.)
Tim Burton (freestyle captain) and
Tom Britton represented Imperial on
skis – notably throwing down a switch
180 and a dodgy somersault respec-
tively in the slopestyle.
On snowboard, Jamie Perrelet made
it through to the final round of the big
air contest on the strength of a solid
360 landed with style and panache.
It’s also worth mentioning here that
Imperial College is still host to the
BUISC female freestyle champion Ces
O’Hanlon from last year.
BUDS takes place at the Midlothian
ski centre in Hillend just outside of
Edinburgh and is always a memora-
ble/terrifying experience. The ski race
is held over 2 days on the biggest dry
slope in Europe, which winds its way
down a mountain on the outskirts of
Edinburgh. Not only do the competi-
tors have to brace themselves for the
cold windy weather of Scotland, they
also have to ski down a very steep
Dendex slope riddled with bumps and
patches of grass. You may ask yourself
the question “why do this?” but every
year thousands of university students
turn up to try and prove who is the
fastest or craziest skier in the land and,
Imperial is no exception.
2008 saw the largest BUDS ever,
with 1350 people attending, including
450 male and 250 female competitors
entered in both individual slalom and
giant slalom events. This made this
year’s races very competitive. However
the ski team rose to the challenge with
individual members setting some ex-
cellent times. Charles Hudson, Alexan-
der Davenport and Michael Parkes all
finished within the top 90 fastest men
in both slalom and GS events.
In true Imperial style the team took
only one girl to compete, however
Marianne Rolph did very well nar-
rowly missing out on making the top
30 girls.
One skier on the Grand Slalom
needed airlifting out with a helicopter
after over an hour of treatment on the
slope itself. The incident had a mas-
sive knock-on effect to the remainder
of the ski competitions, which cul-
minated in the ski team dual slaloms
being effectively cancelled. Instead,
the top 16 universities were picked to
battle it out based on the individual
results from the previous day, leaving
out our ski team. (BUCS regulations
stipulate that a Champion University
had to be decided that weekend, which
is why the competition was not simply
rescheduled.)
On the whole, the snowsports team
has already improved a lot this year
with all of the newest members show-
ing massive improvements having at-
tended regular training and, now with
solid performances at BUDS, the team
hopes to improve and build on the
progress it has made.
The next tournament is the Brit-
ish Universities Indoors Snowsports
Championships (or BUISC) that starts
in the New Year at indoor snow domes
across the country. Imperial will be
competing in the southern qualifiers
and hopefully the finals further north
if all goes well.
It’s not too late to get involved with
the race team, so if you’re up for hurling
yourself down steep slopes at break-
neck speeds, dodging objects, pulling
tricks, getting hyper on adrenaline and
merry with a myriad of other Universi-
ties at the some of the country’s hugest
student social events then let us know
via ski@imperial.ac.uk. Failing that,
book yourself onto the Imperial ski trip
to Val Thorens in the Christmas holi-
days for a more concentrated dose.
The Women’s 1st volleyball team ce-
mented their position at the top of the
BUCS South Eastern Conference 1A
after a flawless performance at the sec-
ond round of tournaments at Reading
University.Theymaintainedtheir100%
record, recording three more wins to
add to the two convincing victories the
previous Sunday at the University of
Kent. The women are yet to drop a set
and have already secured their place in
the BUCS last sixteen playoffs.
Imperial volleyball reaching new heights
Emanuel Balsamo They faced Reading, Sussex and
Kent and won each encounter 2-0. The
score lines made for impressive read-
ing. 25-8 was the first set score against
a Sussex side that could not handle an
Imperial side firing on all cylinders.
Reading and Kent could not do much
better as opponents struggled to reach
double figures.
There is no question that the Impe-
rial ladies have been training harder
than any other opponents and this was
visible as the team played as a cohesive
unit.
Alana played a captain’s role as she
scored point after a point from the
outside hitting position as well as
some spectacular backcourt middle
hits. Playmaker Ashly Black put on a
master class of setting, distributing the
ball deceptively to keep the opposition
blockers always guessing. Brazilian
defensive specialist Regina was in-
credibly accurate in service reception,
freeing Black up to execute Imperial’s
fast and exciting brand of volleyball.
Middle hitters Linda and Ascha were
dominant and fast at the net, slamming
down Black’s quick sets with immense
power. Dynamic French phD student
Amelie showed some deft touches as
well as unstoppable cross court spikes.
First year Jen also impressed, particu-
larly with a huge block in the Kent
game as the whole squad showed great
focus and team spirit to dominate all
three games from the beginning.
Left-handed and elegant attacker
Emily Boyd was in scintillating form
the whole day, with Black stretching
the opposition blockers by setting up
Boyd frontcourt and backcourt, and
time and time again her strong hits
found the opponents floor to keep the
scoreboard ticking over.
The team are improving each game
and so far this season have played 13
games in all competitions and won all
of them, including a prestigious pre-
season tournament and qualification
for the English Volleyball Association
Student Cup Finals, beating South-
ampton University and top 8 BUCS
ranked Cambridge University along
the way.
IC swimming
take on nation
Last weekend IC swim club travelled
up to Ponds Forge swimming pool
in Sheffield to take part in the BUCS
championships. It is one of the biggest
galas of the year, with several team GB
and Olympic swimmers taking part.
The IC team did not disappoint, with
several great performances, including
their coach who managed to miss the
train. Andrew Hagues finished 16th
and 21st in the 50m and 100m back-
stroke respectively, finishing just a sec-
ond outside the final in the 50m. Kent
Zheng smashed his long-standing
PB in the 100m breaststroke, show-
ing promise for the rest of the season.
Matt Steere finished a brilliant 12th
in the gruelling 1500m freestyle, with
Erika Cule and Thomas Whitehead-
Clarke both taking chunks out of per-
sonal best times. Performance of the
weekend goes to the men’s medley
relay team who despite being put to-
gether that morning took seconds off
past times. With such good perform-
ances this early in the season, and the
extremely young squad the club have,
things are looking promising for the
months to come.

Caffeine overdose!!
Who is that lucky chap in the middle?
On 7th November, 29 excitable la-
crosse players set off for the club’s 2nd
annual tour to Oxford. The promise
of booze, boogying, bonding, a fair
amount of fancy dress and a cheeky la-
crosse match awaited us in this beauti-
ful city. Friday saw us hitting the town
in our uber-sexy red tour shirts. After
a round of rather lethal fish bowls to
break the ice at a local cocktail bar, we
made our way to the student night at
Bar Risa which was in the ideal loca-
tion- next door to our hostel! A great
night was had by all, which was evident
judging by the horrific hangovers ex-
perienced the morning after!
After a morning spent blearily ex-
ploring Oxford (seeking out coffee to
wake us up!), we arrived at University
Parks, psyched for a highly competitive
match against the Oxford University
mixed team.
Despite a great effort from all our
players (and enough people to field
3 teams!) we lost fairly comfortably.
However, we looked upon this as a
great opportunity for everyone, par-
ticularly the new players, to compete
against one of the best mixed lacrosse
teams in the country. Following a few
friendly pints at a local pub with our
rivals, we returned to don our jungle
themed fancy dress in preparation for
the second evening of debauchery.
Outfits ranged from leopards to trees
with varying success and levels of na-
kedness. We even had our very own
‘snow leopard’ made from a children’s
furry dalmation outfit?!
After a cosy team curry we made our
way to Clementine’s for more drink-
ing and more dancing. Unfortunately
getting caught in a huge rain storm
on the way was a bit of a disaster for
those wearing face paint! The rain did
not dampen our spirits however as we
danced the night away to such cheesy
classics as the ‘Macarena’.
Sunday saw the club drag itself out
into Oxford once more for tour fines
and a pub lunch before we headed
back to London broken but satisfied.
A weekend of drunken carnage was
over…until next year..!
