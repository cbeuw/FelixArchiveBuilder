Hearts on Fire at Alexandra Palace
O
ow! My eyes!” Those
were the ecstatic
screams of a grown
man, gazing with awe
at the spectacular Ally
Pally firework display on Saturday
night.
North London came out in force,
from families to chavvy youths,
perched on the slopes of Alexandra
Park. Reputably the most spectacular
firework display in London, the ben-
efits were obvious; unimpeded views
for all.
The display more than lived up to
expectation, essentially ‘it was better
than last year’. Set to a medley of clas-
sical music from film soundtracks, the
fireworks kept to the style, with rhyth-
mical bursts and interesting composi-
tions lighting up the sky. At an intense
pace, the fireworks detonated thick
and fast.
The glittery clouds and sparkly foun-
tains (apologies for the flaky, nontech-
nical description) were my personal
favourites. My heart goes out to the
poor animals traumatised by the deaf-
eningly loud rockets. They were very,
very loud.
So far a perfect night, thoroughly
deserving of five stars. Such a shame
when things took a turn for the worse
post-fireworks. Like an episode of ‘The
Simpsons’, the people of North London
stampeded up the hill in search of al-
cohol. The mob took down all security
fences in their path, racing to reach the
Bier Festival.
Suddenly the evening became ex-
tremely tedious, I lost all patience
with being herded around by security.
The whole experience became uncan-
nily like a music festival. The crowd
grew restless. The muddy slippery
hillside ruined my footwear. The toilet
queues grew exponentially longer. The
bar, if you could get near, ran out of
beer. Generally it showed all the hall-
mark symptoms of large-scale event
disorganisation.
It’s a shame these factors inevitably
spoilt the experience. The organisers
clearly put a lot of thought into making
a pleasant, family-friendly night, with
a choice of ice-skating, fun-fairs, live
music and the Bier Festival within the
massive Victorian venue.
The kids clearly had the most fun
on the night, running rampage on
the trampolines, bungy-swings and
rock-climbing wall. ‘Queen on Fire’, a
fairly convincing Queen tribute band
performed indoors in the main hall.
However they disappointed many
by cutting to playback on ‘Bohemian
Rhapsody’. The Bier Festival had a very
poor selection of two German beers,
which promptly ran dry at that. Secu-
rity cracked down on revellers dancing
on top of the long tables. It was ‘alright’
but many chose to drink elsewhere.

I’m gonna hazard a guess and say that this is Alexandra Palace. Just a thought!

SHIT
Jorge Costa
Movies and popcorn, hot chocolate
and wintry days, Tim Burton and John-
ny Depp, Amy Winehouse and a crate
of JD; all, for one reason or another, are
perfect combinations. Sure, you can
have one without the other, but it’s not
the same. You could even try toying
with the formula, but the results more
often than not end up dubious: hot
chocolate in summer? Sacrilege!
After experiencing Valgeir Sigurðs-
son and Sam Amidon in St Barnabas’
Chapel earlier this year, I’d like to add
“lovely, creaky folk music and Icelandic
electronic neo-classical in chapels” to
that list. It’s a match made in heaven,
one where the delicate musical ar-
rangements and quietly emotive vocal
deliveries perfectly complement the
intimate setting, hushed reverence and
dense atmospheres of these places of
worship. This is why I jumped at the
chance of seeing Ólafur Arnalds at the
Union Chapel.
Hailing from the small Icelandic
town of Mosfellsbær, the 21 year old
has spent 2008 supporting Sigur Rós
on their latest tour while promoting
his acclaimed debut album. ‘Eulogy For
Evolution’ is a promising start for this
talented musician with its assured and
beautiful string-and-piano composi-
tions punctuated by sudden outbursts
of post-rock chaos.
Opening for Arnalds on the night
was German folk singer, Finn. Walk-
ing on stage with white tape under his
eyes, what looked like a baggy white
shirt with a giant collar worn back-
wards, and black socks pulled up to his
knees and over his mud-brown trou-
sers, I was left with the impression that
this is probably what an Amish space-
man would look like. His plaintive gui-
tar-and-violin melodies earthed his set
however, and his mournful vocals laid
the mood for the rest of the evening
despite a rather distant performance,
overall.
Finn did make something obvious:
his playing about with effects pedals
to create ‘extra’ guitarists and echo-y
backing vocalists was an indicator that
Arnalds’ set would
unfortunately
summon simi-
lar, ghostly
musi-
cians playing out of a Mac. Given the
budgets of these relatively unknown
acts it’s probably unfair to complain,
but it’s still ever so slightly disappoint-
ing to discover that the live show you’re
about to experience isn’t completely,
well, live.
So I didn’t particularly mind (or hon-
estly, notice), when a few songs into his
set, Arnalds forgets to press a button
that would have conjured his frantic
post-rock guitar and drum noise on
‘3704 3837’. His live piano and string
quartet proved sufficient enough to fill
that gap and despite some sound issues
that prevented one of the instruments
from delivering that extra ‘oomph’, the
sound was general absorbing and hyp-
notic. The quartet was particularly
entrancing, their Philip Glass-inspired
strokes washing over the pews, rever-
berating around the cold building and
enveloping the audience with a bit-
tersweet haziness. Sitting in front of a
grand piano, Arnalds’ melodies were
just as affecting.
Throughout, Arnalds was perfectly
inviting as he honestly and humor-
ously mentioned any gaffs and as well
as the terrors of having to come back
for an encore: “You go back stage and
talk about the horrors of the show, but
then you realise that people are still
clapping!” It was then that he offered
to replay ‘3704 3837’, this time with the
button pressed.
A few weeks ago, I was having a
conversation with a friend who had
“This is probably
what Amish
spacemen look
like.”
Olafur Arnalds
live at the
Union Chapel
become bored with live music. Hav-
ing recently attended various gigs full
of obnoxious, Red Stripe drinking piss
heads who insist on speaking through-
out an entire performance, I could un-
derstand where he was coming from.
But when the crowd is perfect and the
setting is right, there isn’t a better ex-
perience. For this gig, that experience
came with the main set’s closing song,
‘Himininn er ad Hrynju’. What sound-
ed like the bleeps of a heart monitor
was soon joined by a spooky and heav-
ily distorted robotic voice as eerie pro-
jections of spirit-white bird silhouettes
floated up from the chapel’s altar and
across the stain-glass windows.
It was an incredibly chilling, goose-
bump-inducing effect and while Ar-
nalds did little to
stray from the
sound of the
record, it’s
surprises
like this
which
make live
music
worth-
while.
And the
venue
couldn’t
be
more
ap-
pro-
priate.
