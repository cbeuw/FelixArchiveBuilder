Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition -8
Whadafuh happened last week? I’ll tell
you what! An EPIC FAIL of gargantuan
proportions. Why you ask? Well it all
started with a loving text from Jovan,
the felix editor in chief. Within this all
so loving SMS message were the words
“felix down.” Now I have just implied
that this text message was more in
depth than it really was. “felix down”
were the ONLY words included in the
all so friendly communication medium.
Seriously, whatdafuh? So as the storey
goes, I aimlessly wandered down to the
depths of the Beit west basement, to
(in a not so aimlessly manner) discover
the truth behind the looming words
“felix down.” When I eventually found
out, it wasn’t the worst news that could
have come our way. The words “felix
down” in fact meant the network had
fucked up, and there was no way to ac-
cess Dreamserve. Just to clue you in,
Dreamserve is the central server felix
runs on. What does that mean? well to
put it bluntly, it mean no one could log
onto the computers, no one could edit
their pages for the weeks issue, and it
also meant that last weeks issue was
8. Sex:
There are 2 types of people at Impeial
College. Those who have sex, and
those that don’t. Either way, everyone
loves sex, just some aren’t getting any.
For those that arn’t don’t worry, just
don’t start sleeping with hookers. For
those that are, well done. With the
reputation IC sudents have it’s good
that your rebelling. Also for those that
are, don’t forget S.H.A.G. week starts
monday 24th
November. it is the per-
fect place to pick up FREE condoms,
lube and learn about the STI’s your
more likely to pick up because your
sexually active.

This weeks winner. Team Rubbish Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Rubbish. It was starting
to become a bit repetitive, but we
were short on entries this week, and
we love hello kitty. You get the points
this week, but other budding photo
shop artists please join in. These guys
are good, but i’m sure someone will
stop their reign of terror victory.
Keep up the good work, and please en-
ter again next week.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as Kylie.
G
ood day mate. I’m Snaky
B dressed as Kylie. That’s
right, the really old aus-
sie bird who everyone
thinks is so hot. Not as
hot a Pamela Anderson, but still HOT.
Unfortunately i’m not way near as hot
as my younger sister Danni, but she’s
way hot, even I would. Australia is hot,
not a beautiful way, but in the, ‘we’ve
fucked up the ozone and now all us
convicts have skin cancer’ kind of way.
Oh wait, I shouldn’t talk about cancer,
however I did do well to overcome it.
Other problem with us fucking the
ozone is the issues we now have with
our Foster’s.... well you wouldn’t want
a warm beer would you? Mate. Well I
don’t care, I’m Kylie and I’m the Prin-
cess of pop, waiting in the wings for that
scrawney bitch Madonna to die. Why
is she the Queen? I got over cancer...
she didn’t even get over Guy Ritchie
and make multiple babies. She was too
busy spazing out over her imaginary
(show me the evidence) religion. Plus
I’m a much better actor, I did Neigh-
bours for fucks sake- Madonna did
‘Swept Away’ I don’t see that winning
any awards. She needs to die. Mate.

This week’s image is of a certain 2nd
year physicist. I was staring to think
physics students were beginning to
break the trend of the nerdy video
game players. Obviously not as one
was caught playing a Nintendo DS.

going to be a total shambles.
Howevertherewasonesolution.This
involved everyone writing their pages
on their respective computers, then
transfering all the files and pictures via
a USB memory stick. A painfully slow
process that has a risk factor greater
than going down on a girl with herpes.
In the end, a 40 page issue was whittled
down to 32. All because the confusion
created caused files to be corrupted, of
pictures to go missing. At one point a
whole folder with a complete section
of felix in it just disappeared. Again,
whadafuh! The effect on the timing
resulted in the issue not being copy
edited. A point made by one irate felix
reader who came into the office on the
friday demanding an explanation.
I would like to apologies to you all
on behalf of the felix team. We know
it was a failed issue and a discredit to
our loyal readers, but we will definitely
endeavour to prevent this happening
again. At the current time of writing,
Dreamserve is up and working fine. No
tearing up this weeks issue every time
you see it Kadhim.
