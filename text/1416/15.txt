ood day, everyone! Apol-
ogies about last week’s
absence - an update
patch killed the connec-
tion between our Mac
Tiger servers and Leopard iMacs, so
our article submissions were flying all
over the room and mine just got lost!
Like the folks on this week’s Engadget
podcast put it: “it’s a great time to be
alive”, with two of my most-anticipated
devices - HTC Touch HD and Sony
Ericsson Xperia X1 - being launched, as
well as the INQ1 Facebook phone from
3, and a new iPhone firmware expected
to come out soon. I’m actually very
surprised to hear that the Blackberry
Storm does not have wifi, probably to
milk more money from unlimited-data
plans. If you’re lucky enough to be an
owner of the Touch HD, Storm, Xperia
X1 or even the T-Mobile G1, we’d like
to hear from you.
Whilst on the topic, I’ve recently
picked up the unreleased (abandoned?)
Sony Ericsson M610i smartphone from
eBay. I don’t know why but every now
and then I do search for prototype mo-
bile phones or even laptops. I’ve never
used a Symbian phone properly before
- the last one (and my first ever) I had
was the Sendo X, which I sold just two
weeks after I bought it, simply because
of my dissatisfaction with its sync
speed with Windows. The hardware
was well-built though, but that didn’t
save the company from liquidisation.
However, the M610i was overshad-
A
pple’s anti-Windows
campaign has been quite
successful with get-
ting PC users’ attention,
boosting their compu-
ter sales figure to an all-time-high 2.6
million in Q4 2008; likewise for their
iPhone figure, jumping from Q3’s 717k
units to Q4’s staggering 6.9 million
units. If you’re wondering whether it’s
time for you to join the Mac party, then
you might find this article useful.
I had been waiting for the right Mac-
Book for a long time, the previous gen-
erations being impractical with their
scratch-magnetic polycarbonate cases.
So when the aluminium MacBooks
came out four weeks ago, I was so fas-
cinated by its manufacturing process
that I immediately bought my first ever
Mac (the 2.0GHz MacBook) at the Re-
gent Street Store the next day. It was
about time as well: I’ve been through
five or six Windows laptops and have
suffered from the lack of built-in, pro-
fessional-looking multimedia editors.
Yes, Windows Movie Maker is very
easy to use, but its boring templates
mean your videos will all look the
same; not the best choice if you want
your video to stand out.
Back in the Windows days I was stuck
with Adobe Premiere Pro and Nero Vi-
sion, both being very time-consuming
to edit with and the latter provided
only a few DVD menu templates of ac-
ceptable presentation. In the contrary,
when I came across Apple’s impressive
iMovie app at the Regent Street store,
I couldn’t stop thinking how much bet-
ter my DVDs could have been, and
how much time I could have saved
back then with a Mac.
Now my dream of owning the per-
fect machine has come true. Or has it?
Here are my thoughts of my first-Mac
experience so far:
Build quality / Service
Let’s talk about the hardware first. I
am probably the world’s unluckiest guy
to have gone through two MacBooks
within four days after my purchase:
the first one had a dead pixel (and ap-
parently I was the first in the country
to have reported a problem with the
new MacBook), but fortunately Ap-
ple did a direct
swap followed by
an overnight mi-
gration service. I
thought that was
a smooth process,
until on my way
home on the bus
I noticed that the
replacement had
a chipped hinge,
which brought
me back to the
store. Hope-
fully my third
one (which
I’m typing on
right now)
will be less
trouble-
some. Hav-
ing said that,
I must praise Apple’s efficient service
but do be careful with where you serv-
ice your Mac: some Hong Kong users
told me that they were refused replace-
ments for having just one dead pixel
instead of three or more.
The actual body itself is very well-
built: London-born Jony Ive CBE, Ap-
ple’s Senior Vice-President of Industri-
al Design, calls it “precision aluminium
unibody enclosure” (kudos for not
saying “aluminum”) which provides a
very strong structure with fewer parts.
Like my old ThinkPad, I would hap-
pily pick up my MacBook on just one
corner, with the lid open, knowing that
it wouldn’t flex. I originally feared that
the metallic edges were going to be a
problem, but they are actually nicely
sanded for your wrists’ pleasure, unlike
the plastic MacBooks.
Input Interface
The new glass trackpad now supports
multi-touch gestures, making life a lot
easier: scrolling is the same as before
with two fingers, three-fingers for for-
ward and backward, four-fingers for
Exposé (similar purpose to Vista’s “Flip
3D”), the obvious rotation and zoom
gestures etc. It really didn’t take long to
get used to these. Also, the click but-
ton is gone! Steve Jobs is known to hate
buttons (although we have yet to see
a touchscreen Mac) so now the entire
trackpad has cleverly become the but-
ton. Again I found it very easy to use,
as your thumb can still click on where
the button used to be. Right-click is
made easier as well by just clicking
down with two fingers.
Ports and Guts
Now this is where Apple has let every-
one down: the MacBook no longer has
a Firewire port (a high speed connec-
tion for camcorders and hard drives).
As mentioned before, one of my main
intentions of getting a Mac was for
video editing, so Cupertino has broken
my heart a little here. To make up for
it though, Apple
teamed up with
NVIDIA and
gave birth to the
9400M chipset,
which churns
out much more
graphics power
than the old
MacBook.
The sweeties
from previous
models are still
here: the Mag-
Safe power
cord connec-
tor is prob-
ably still the
best inven-
tion to date
in the lap-
top world,
followed by Apple’s compact power
adapter which has two retractable
hooks for cable management. The
slide-in optical drive and the screen’s
gradual ambient light sensor alone are
enough to force Oxford redefine the
word “cool”.
All the ports are neatly located on
the left hand side of the laptop, which
can be both a good thing and a bad
thing: the good is obviously the neat-
ness and clean look, but the downside
is that you may have to relocate your
various peripherals to reach the ports,
and then you’ll worry about the lack of
extra USB ports: I personally find that
five should be the standard for anyone
(mouse, pen drive, iPod/iPhone, print-
er and camera), so MacBook users will
have to invest on a USB hub (powered
ones are recommended).
Stability
Now onto the software front: Mac us-
ers have always been proud of their
system’s stability, but over the last few
weeks I had already had several crash-
es. For instance, I bought an HP all-in-
one printer with the new MacBook,
but when I attempted to do some scan-
ning the entire system just crashed,
forcing me to hard-reboot; and literally
just now it crashed again when I was
simply browsing my documents, and
took at least five reboots to get back to
the normal state. At neither events did
Ravi’s advice of using “cmd+alt+esc”
(Mac’s “Ctrl+Alt+Del”) work. Perhaps
it’s just early days.
My other problem is iPhoto: it’s sim-
ply stupid. I tried to burn an album
onto a CD using iPhoto, but rather
than having a disc full of JPEG files I
got three versions of iPhoto library
files instead, forcing you to use iPhoto
to load the photos. Lame.
Ignoring all the above though OS X
really is quite nice: even for a first-tim-
er like myself it’s very easy to use, and it
takes literally only a few seconds from
lid closed to fully awake, search is light-
ning-fast, awesome “iLife ‘08” suite bar
iPhoto, expandable workspace using
Spaces, powerful self-repair tools etc.
Verdict
Overall, the experience so far is quite
nice and I have only the few regrets
mentioned above plus a dented bank
account. OS X is very easy to pick up,
but if you think otherwise then I’m
sure the free Apple seminars at Regent
Street will be of great help. Many say
that once you go Mac, you never go
back (like felix has done), but I doubt
I’ll become one of those – Mac is ob-
viously not as perfect as many fanboys
claim, plus Windows machines love my
wallet. If you insist on getting the new
MacBook/MacBook Pro, I suggest that
you hold on for a few more weeks to let
Apple rid the bugs in the new systems.
“For a first-timer
like myself it’s
very easy to use”
owed by the arrival of my Touch HD
and Xperia X1. Both Windows Mo-
bile phones are probably HTC’s best
phones to date, even though the lat-
ter is released under a different brand.
Build quality is superb, probably only
let down by the less-than-ideal OS
(many wish for Android on them). The
graphical interface is great but still far
from perfect (laggy, lacking few practi-
cal functions, etc.). If I were to choose
my favourite out of the two, I think the
Xperia’s keyboard has won my heart.
Moving on to cameras: have you
seen the sample movies recorded on
the Canon EOS 5D Mark II? This 21.1-
megapixel DSLR does some real good
HD video capture, and the quality
beats the Nikon D90’s jelly-like, 720p
video recording (and I am admitting
that fault as a Nikon fanboy). Although
quite pricey, as with most prosumer
cameras, I like the fact that you don’t
have to carry both a DSLR and an HD
camcorder, as the former alone is pain-
ful enough to carry around, especially
through airports where they still limit
you to one hand-carry only. Well, I bet-
ter start looking for a sponsor!
This week I decided to share my
thoughts on my Mac virgin-experi-
ence, as it would probably appeal to
most current Windows users (but not
so much with stubborn Linux users).

As one of many who have bought Ap-
ple’s new iPhone 3G, I too know the
drawbacks of email on a mobile de-
vice. The mobile distractions when out
with friends (or even when, perhaps,
in lectures) used to extend to receiving
the occasional text message or phone
call. This has since been upgraded to
being able to instantly acquire the lat-
est pointless news from some society’s
mailing list that you now regret signing
up for in freshers’ fair.
Unfortunately, having used a GMail
account for the past 4 years (has GMail
been in beta for FOUR YEARS!?), I was
rather unhappy to find out that Goog-
le do not offer a push email service.
Simply speaking, instead of having an
email arrive on my iPhone soon after
it is sent, my phone simply checks my
GMail account for new emails every x
minutes, where x is a minimum of 15.
Apple originally came up with a so-
lution by teaming up with Yahoo for
their “YMail” service, which would
give “free push email to all iPhone us-
ers.” However, recently, some users
including myself have noticed that
the push email service seems to have
silently stopped. Although there are
many other push email solutions avail-
able online, I decided to try Apple’s
new MobileMe.
Despite being an avid mac user for
the last few years, I have never tried us-
ing Apple’s now obsolete .Mac service.
Apple have since thoroughly improved
this, renaming it to MobileMe, and
giving great support for iPhone users.
Even though MobileMe publicly didn’t
have a smooth start, I decided to sign
up for a free trial account. MobileMe
offers much more than push email,
including an address book contact list
which keeps in sync over-the-air (great
for getting someone’s number whilst
out on your phone, and finding it on
your PC or Mac seconds later, without
any need to sync), a calendar service,
highly comparable to Google calendar,
adecentphotostorage/sharingwebapp,
tightly integrated with the iPhone and
iPhoto, and finally iDisk, which is very
useful for having synchronized folders
between your computers.
AfterusingMobileMeforafewweeks
and experiencing the tight integration
service offered, MobileMe feels like a
product which really bridges the small
gaps. Even if I didn’t own an iPhone, or
even a Mac, MobileMe is highly use-
ful for sharing files and photos with
friends, and even having synchronized
bookmarks and folders between my
other computers. Setup is quick and
painless, and the settings sync between
all your devices. Back to my mac screen
sharing is something hard to live with-
out, and feels very responsive.
Overall, I would highly recommend
MobileMe for most Mac users. Even if
you just sign up for the free trial for a
short time, I think most will agree that
it is a smooth and seamless service that
keeps those important things in sync.
“MobileMe is a new Internet service
from Apple that syncs email, contacts,
and calendars from a secure Internet
server, or "cloud," to all the devices you
use: your iPhone, iPod touch, as well as
Mac and PC computers. This data is
accessible anywhere and automatically
ensures that you get identical email,
contacts, and calendars, no matter
which device you use. MobileMe also
provides a suite of ad-free web appli-
cations that deliver a desktop-like ex-
perience through any modern browser.
Me.com is the place where it all comes
together. MobileMe applications at
me.com include Mail, Contacts, and
Calendar, as well as Gallery for viewing
and sharing photos, 20GB of storage,
and iDisk for online file sharing”

Mobile Me + iPhone = Nice?
Backup your work
A review of the Western Digital My Book
Ravi Pall
Technology Editor
With a previous article about the
online backup service provided by
Mozzy, it may be thought it would be
worth while investing in your very own
backup solution. We are all hard work-
ing students living in the age of the in-
ternet, but it simply isn’t worth while
backing up all your data on an online
service. The downfalls including band-
width limitations, transfer speed and
the knowledge that your data is with
a 3rd
party. It would seem for the aver-
age user at home, the simplest answer
to this problem is to buy an external
HDD (Hard Disk Drive). Thefore the
first thing I did was to trawl though the

internet, looking for the best solution I
could find at a reasonable price.
Along came the Western Digital My
Book. The model I chose was latest
version of the My Book comes in a very
sleek matt black finish. Asthetics aside,
let me engross you with the all so geeky
details. My personal My Book has a
1TB storage capacity. A bit excessive I
know, but some people need this stor-
age now, and I’m sure there will come
a day I will too. One of the first things
I did was to transfer my 65GB iTunes
library across, which bearly dented the
capacity of this drive. At this point I’d
like to mention how quick this was. Us-
ing Firewire 400 the whole library was
transferred in less than 20 minutes. As
I have just mention the Firewire 400,
now is the time to mention the
connectivit. All the ports are on
the back, which include the power
input, 2 Firewire ports, a USB 2.0
port and 1 eSATA port. Thats alot
of flexibility from a drive with the
form factor of a small dictionary.
It wasn’t particularly cheep
though. The 1TB My Book with
eSATA cost about £120, but this is
still very competitively priced with
similar products available. WD is
also a big name in HDD’s so the
2 year included warranty, like the
unit, is reliable. There is no noise,
and it runs cool even though there
is no fan. The top feature is the au-
tomatic on sevice which only turn
the HDD on when connected. WD My Book
