Mustapher Botchway
Sports Editors
Too many teams? Superclubs
still the best solution
T
he league table is here!
Start getting excited about
the prospect of the ulti-
mate prize (to be decided
in due course)!
In other news, we have a big debate
about the vandalism in Hammersmith
Celebrations are fine, but let us cel-
ebrate without causing a fuss.
Mustapher has managed to track
down a captain to express his opinions
about the Rugby Club. Hopefully this
will now be weekly feature. Want to be
interviewed? Drop us a line.
Last week’s editorial prompted mass
debate from the Miners. Medical
School students, what are your views?
Dear Editors,
Do we need “tea society” or a “cheese
society”? The answer is clear, yes we
do, because the students want one and
surely the purpose of the Union is to
give the students what they want. There
would be no faculty teams if no-one
wanted them, nobody would show up to
play and they would vanish.
The whole point of a faculty team
is for people to play sports who don’t
have the time to attend the sometimes
demanding schedule of IC teams. For
example, I believe IC Rugby have over 3
training sessions a week. They are also
for people who want to take up a new
sport in a no-pressure environment or
for people that cannot commit to every
training and match session. Although
it’s great that some people are good
enough to play in a first team (it obvi-
ously makes then fell like a big man) it’s
not for everyone. Merging all teams into
one “superteam” wont change the strain
clubs have on the IC purse strings either,
if people where to join IC teams instead
of faculty teams then surely the club
would need more money to support the
new members? In fact, having players
join the IC teams as well as their fac-
ulty team (as many do) means they pay
membership to two clubs and so pro-
vide the college with more income!!
The point about playing for a social
team, which the Sports Editor referred
to as “bollocks” is more about the re-
laxed social atmosphere on the pitch
as opposed to at the pub (where it also
exists of course). Faculty teams, due to
their general lower league ranking don’t
take games as seriously as games in the
premiership division so people (espe-
cially beginners) are not pressured or
shouted at if they don’t play well which
is a big factor for people who are start-
ing out and for anyone else who just
wants to do some exercise, spend time
with their mates and get some fresh air.
The Editors belittling of the RSM Foot-
ball team is exactly the kind of attitude
we want to avoid and is exactly why we
like our faculty teams, so thank you for
proving our point for us.
Charlotte Atteck
Dear Editors,
I personally play hockey for RSM and
IC 1st team, so can appreciate the ar-
gument that if every hockey player at
Imperial played for the same club, then
that club would be superior and more

successful. However, it must be under-
stood that not every hockey player at
Imperial would want to play for such
a club. Such a mergence would mean
that the banter that comes with Varsity
day and inter-faculty matches would
be lost.
RSM are a more relaxed team, with
abilities ranging from novice to county-
standard players. We attract those who
cannot commit to training each week
but like to play their chosen sport on
a regular (or not so regular) basis. We
also offer mixed hockey every Sunday,
something which IC does not. I find it
appealing that RSM sports are less of
a financial drain too. I was shocked to
hear the cost of IC Rugby subs is £70
this year, plus £2 per training session
and the average match costing ~£4-£5.
RSM rugby on the other hand is a mere
£10 a year.
The highlight of the RSM calendar
is the Bottle Match; the second oldest
varsity match in the world. This fixture
has taken place for 107 years and is at-
tended by over 300 people, making it a
very attractive event for Geology and
Material related companies. This is
why such companies are interested in
sponsoring our teams, and this, along
with the RSMU, is where we get the
majority of our funding, NOT from the
ACC.
Abolishing RSM teams would mean
losing traditions that are older than
Imperial College itself. There is also the
issue that certain Imperial clubs (cough
Football cough) have reputations that
their RSM counterparts would not like
to be associated with.
Kingston thrashed by ladies
Hockey
Imperial Women’s 1st XI 2
Kingston Women’s 1st XI 1
We arrived at the Kingston pitch to
find it covered in thick brown sludge.
We were grumbling about getting our
beautiful new kit splattered with mud,
to our surprise Preying Mantis was
the most annoyed by the situation (we
soon realised that it was only because
it meant that she might actually have to
wash her kit before the end of term!).
We got started with the match in the
first half there were a couple of near
misses from us, some good runs from
Malvinas and Slippery Nipple, a few at-
tacks into our D from Kingston which
were cleared neatly by Leper and some
good saves from keeper Fresher Jess.
We kept our game up and a very well
taken long corner from Preying Mantis
and Malvinas resulted in the ball being
crossed to the far post where Stripper
slotted it into the goal. At half time
we were still 1-0 up and keen to score
more goals.
The second half was filled with
many more attacking opportunities
with some good drives through the
midfield from Token Lezza and a few
runs up the wing by Preying Mantis
where she was fouled all the way. The
defence continued to block any King-
ston attacks with Kebab making some
strong tackles and passing it to Domi-
nator on the right who flicked it up the
line to Malvinas. Sloppy Seconds held
the centre defence picking up any stray
balls and making some nice switches
to both Fresher Sam and Wide Open.
We had a few short corners which un-
fortunately did not result in any goals,
however, Prince Charles soon put that
right when she dribbled past the de-
fence and took a hard strike from the
top of the circle which cleanly hit the
top of the back board making the score
2-0.
We kept working throughout the last
ten minutes but unfortunately with five
minutes still to go they managed to in-
vade our circle and after a few unlucky
tackles somehow a ball rolled over the
line and they had scored a rather messy
goal. We kept the pressure on after
that and there were no more attacks
into our circle which meant that we
finished with a victory. We went out to
celebrate that evening to the same ‘Half
Price Curry House’ that we went to the
previous week but this time with two
different men’s hockey teams accom-
panying us, after all we are at Imperial
and so have to spread ourselves out
evenly between the four men’s teams,
although the men’s 1sts are hottest.
Prince Charles
What a bunch of talented ladies. They aren’t half bad at hockey either!
With all of this in mind I think it is
healthy to have a choice of clubs for
sports within our University that cater
for the needs of their players differently.
After all we pride ourselves with having
the largest number of clubs and socie-
ties out of all UK institutions.
Sammy Jones
Firstly thank you for your responses.
Do we need a tea Soc? If I want to
drink tea with some friends then yes
Charlotte I would join such a society.
However, I can categorically say that
an RSM tea society is not needed,
hence why to my knowledge there isn’t
one. Same with cheese. Moving on,
Rugby may hold multiple sessions a
week but they are compulsory for the
1st XV only. The 4th XV hardly to train
in the first place anyway! In regards
to football, training is recommended
though again the 7th XI don’t train as
much. This nullifies your point regard-
ing time constraints. I actually believe
clubs that state that all standards are
welcome because though, like Jack, I
represent ICUAFC 1st XI, the 7th XI
is a team of people who want to give
football a try or have very little experi-
ence playing.
Furthermore, no, the lower teams
are not shouted at if they are losing.
Sorry to dispel such preconceptions of
the bigger clubs. Further play nintendo
wii in your garden, multiplayer, if you
want some exercise with your mates in
the fresh air. Alternatively join a bigger
club where you can get all of that, plus
more.
Sammy, I find it preposterous that
people would want to play for RSM
hockey, but not ICHC. I just don’t see
the logic, especially if RSM hockey
have county standard players. I am yet
to meet someone who has played to a
high-ish standard that doesn’t want to
play with players of a similar ability.
Again, my main argument is not to
abolish these clubs in it’s entirety. Of
course keep them for the Bottle match,
and maybe stretch the definition of the
inter-faculty competitions and allow
you to play. I feel that all this could be
done if said teams were actually part of
their larger counterparts.
Example: The Shankman & Hard-
wick trophies took place last year be-
tween the RCS and CGC football and
hockey teams respectively. I can for a
fact say that I didn’t have to raise any
amount of sponsorship or union funds
to put together an RCS XI.
Point taken about the reputation of
certain clubs. However, that implies
that everyone in the football club con-
dones what happened last Wednesday,
which is certainly false.
The solution is to abolish such teams
to the extent that they receive no fund-
ing and are prohibited from taking part
in ULU/BUCS competitions, leaving
the bigger clubs to receive more fund-
ing (ICU still fund you, no matter how
much you hide/deny it) to subside the
sometimes costly membership fees
and more players of any standard who
want to play their respective sport.

Felix sports league
finally graces us
with it’s presence!
I
t’s back! Let the inter-sport ri-
valry commence. It seems like
Squash have started where they
have left off and are currently
riding high in the table. Rug-
bby men’s 1st on the other hand have
started poorly in BUCS, leaving them
rooted to the bottom. However, it is
early days yet. There are approximately
another 10 games to go so there is all
to play for. There are slight changes to
this year’s league table. Firstly the felix
index (FI) has been formulated in a
very complex manner to reflect the av-
erage points won per game. The points
system is exactly the same as last year:
5 points for a win, -4 points for a loss
and 2 points for a draw. Again BUCS
teams will only be considered for ease.
A ULU counterpart may be devised in
future weeks to reflect the majority of
sports played at Imperial.
When more games are played the
club standings will appear. Further-
more, the team(s) of the week/month
may grace these pages.
One thing that is vital for this to work
is if you send in your results to Alissa
Ayling as soon as possible so we can
keep the league up to date. Good luck!
