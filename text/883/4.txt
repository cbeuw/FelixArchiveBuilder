m Mary's
Toilets
Rag Beer Festival
Last Wednesday night the toilets in the
St.Mary's student union bar were
vandalised, causing damage of
approximately SI50. O n the same
evening, an attempt was made to remove
a sports team photograph from the wall
of the bar, w h i c h resulted in the
smashing of the glass and frame. It was
suspected at the time that Imperial
College Union (ICU) members were those
responsible a n d one of them was traced
from the description given by one of the
barman.
Later, six more offenders came forward
and admitted taken part in the act. They
were ordered to pay the cost of repairs
and fined by I C U . The m o n e y from the
fines will go towards Rag.
It was thought at the time that the
incident had occured because of inflamed
feelings over mascotry. A treasure hunt,
organised by St.Mary's students earlier
this term, had lead to the loss of a
number of signs from Imperial, together
with a Shield from City and Guilds Union.
In light of this the items have and are
being returned.
This year's beer festival raised almost
£4100. According to the Royal College of
Science (RCS), w h o orgainise the festival,
not all the beer was sold, partly due to
the lights in the JCR being turned off at
10.00pm. These lights are computer
controlled a n d could have been turned
back on by security, if they had found
the right key.
The lights finally came back on at 10.30
when the price of a pint was reduced.
Later, the RCS gave away free beer in an
attempt to clear the remaining stock.
Chas Randies, the RCS Vice President last
year, said that everybody had left by
11.30 and that there was no trouble.
The rag stall sold £952 w o r t h of rag
mags and T-shirts during the festival and
will be selling the remaining 'Elephants
Come 91' glasses for £ 1 . 5 0 each in the
Union lounge during lunchtime today.
Also available are 'Dragon Divine 89' T-
shirts and past rag mags.
Poor Uptake for Student Loans
A t the last Finance and Executive
Committee meeting, on the 2nd
November, it was disclosed that only 150
students from Imperial had taken up a
Student Loan. Yesterday, the figure stood
at 200, indicating that just 10 students
were applying each day that the office
was open.
Peter Mee, the College Registrar,
suggested that a 'sensible thing to do'
would be to invest in the forthcoming
electricity share offer. Past records
suggest that a n investment of £460 in
TSB, British Gas, Rolls Royce, British
Telecom, British Steel and other similar
floatations w o u l d profit the investor by
£ 8 0 within the first few weeks.
Unlike some banks' limited overdrafts, a
Student Loan is not interest free but is
linked to the rate of inflation. The
m a x i m u m loan is £ 4 6 0 in London,
rent better accommodation. W h e n
questioned further as to h o w investing in
a mountain bike would help them to pay
off the loan after three years, many
responded by saying that they would be
leaving the country after their course.
There have been rumours that there
could be restrictions on foreign travel
amongst British graduates to prevent this
happening. It has been suggested that the
loan repayment should be w a i v e d if the
repayed a year later. If £ 4 6 0 is borrowed
each year for a three year course, £ 1 4 9 0
would have to be repayed, based o n the
present inflation rate of about 8%.
W h e n a few students were asked what
they would use the loaned money for, a
minority said they would invest the
money in a high interest account. T h e
rest said that they would b u y n e w
cameras, mountain bikes, computers, or
meaning that £ 4 9 5 would have to be
student w o r k s in this country for three
years after graduation.
A n y b o d y interested i n applying for a
loan should visit r o o m 345 o n level 3 of
the Sherfield Building on a Monday,
Wednesday o r Friday between 11.45am
and 3.15pm. Bring with y o u your birth
certificate, a letter confirming a grant and
details of your bank account.
