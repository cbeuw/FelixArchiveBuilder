Manager's Bit n
I W i n
Following the challenge by our glorious
President I have indeed found out the
truth and substance of his actions at the
U K C O S A Conference (FELIX 882). M y
spies have been hard at w o r k and
donemy research.
Appropriately placed on the Union page
overleaf, I have written an informal
appraisal of his deeds. A l t h o u g h not a
gloating exposee of sex and drug orgies 1
do feel that it acts as a very nice
character profile.
There is one bit that 1 missed out due
to late arrival of information, so 1 shall
add it here. A t the end of the story 1
finish with Shan's slip of leaving behind
his U G M report etc in Leeds. O n
Wednesday night he w o r k e d long and
hard to reproduce what he had
previously prepared, for the Thursday
meeting. Only after the meeting had
taken place did poor old Shan find the
missing report in the back pocket of his
jeans! I must just say that it will nice to
have someone vacuuming the office floors
for once, aye Shan.
More Spies
Talking of spies, the interest in Athena's
true identity seems to be hotting up. This
is at least so in the office as 1 have been
continually bombarded with questions
asking w h o they really are. Unfortunately
for the curious I am not about to reveal
their identity.
However, this hasn't stopped those with
lust for knowledge. They have already
deciphered the fact that the writer owns
oroperates an Archimedes computer, likes
the font Homerton Medium, and printed
out his draft copy on Wednesday
lunchtime. The text was transferred onto
a 5.25" disc v i a a 1.2 Megabyte machine
and probably printed on a post script
printer. He is a dedicated typist and
although A t h e n a has not written in by
hand as yet he labeled his disc by hand
and the graphologists are at work. B y the

Photocopier Troubles
A s ever we are plagued b y a cursed
photocopier machine. A n engineer
arrives, the current problem disappears
and as soon as he goes, a new, more
deadly problem arises.
A d d to this the hassle of the rental
company going bust and you have a
wonderfully tangled mess. It's more like a
ramble through the jungle than a nice
day in the office dear. It w o u l d be nice to
think that the beast will be up and
running later today, but w h o knows.
Disturbing
W e received a letter at the office a
couple of days ago concerning the 24
hour collection for Mencap. This event
happened a couple of weeks ago and
featured some of the more experienced
rag teams from around the country.
Cardiff Rag, w h o wrote the letter, in
particular had an impressive turn out and
collected for the whole of the 24 hour
period in m a n y successful places.
The letter describes various problems
that occured while w o r k i n g with the ICU
Rag team w h o hosted the event. A t this
point in time we have not yet had time
to properly analyse the facts from all
sides and without this any speculation is
pointless. H o w e v e r , if stories of missing
collecting cans are valid then somebody,
somewhere has got to start worrying.
Even if the missing money simply turns
up on another student union's charity
total it still allows suspicion and doubt to
rear its ugly head. Not a situation that
reflects a whiter than white image.
Deadlines
Unless you lot out there keep to the
deadlines y o u won't get anything in Felix.

PS The bike shop which is
advertised is r u n by a great
chap who has recently restarted the
business. A few years back he used to
operate just off the Fulham Road near
to Evelyn Gardens. Due to sky high
rents he was forced out of his
premises but has now started anew.
For IC students he is offering a 2 0 %
discount on repairs and accessories
and for now a 5 % discount on new
bikes. He hopes to up this to 10% if
business goes well. So treat him
nicely!
