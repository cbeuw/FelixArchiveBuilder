Pet Shop Boys
—Behaviour LP
Behaviour is the fifth album from the
Shoppies, comprising their first new
material for almost three years. Somehow
it comes as no surprise to find that they
haven't chosen to divert from their o w n
eccentric path through rock 'n' roll.
For this record the duo are reputed to
have gone in search of the oldest synths
they could find (Casio VL-Tone owners of
the world unite) for those elusive
spaceship landing noises. Whether this is
true or not, certainly the record sounds
simpler than their previous denser work;
production by Harold ' A x e l F'
Faltermeyer highlights this with decidedly
low-key mixing.
The album opens with Being Boring
which is either autobiographical
or...something else. This track is so gentle
it's almost offensive, but simultaneously
carries the usual hideously addictive vocal
hook (all the more so for the triteness of
the lyrics). The second track is burdened
with an intolerably long name which I
cannot be bothered to repeat here; a neat
mid-pace sweep with an arc of guitar
from Johnny Marr and possibly the most
familiar make-up of any track on the
record. To Face The Truth follows and
the Shoppies make the mistake of falling
into standard dance/soul patterns with
the result that the song is appalling. Next
up is How Can You Expect To Be Taken
Seriously?, a quick and witty snipe at
rock monsters and their fans.
The flip opens with My October
Symphony, w o r t h a mention for a guest
appearance by the Balanescu String
Quartet (who supported, for want of a
better word, o n the tour). So Hard
follows, oddly out of place, then
Nervously, a relative non-entity; The End
Of The World is another bittersweet
breakup song. Jealousy closes the L P
quietly.
Behaviour is not the Pet Shop Boys'
finest moment but fans won't be
disappointed and they may gain a few
converts. The next single Being Boring is
due for release on November 12th and a
tour is in the works.

If you're a regular club goer and an
indie/dance crossover lovechild, you'll
love this EP. It is made up of the 7" and
12" versions of The Storm and covers of
the Rolling Stones' She's Like a Rainbow.
However, it is very m u c h a studio sound,
and we doubt they would be able to
reproduce it live.
The Storm (7") is fairly poppy, but
lyrically sound (Tve tried a thousand
times to make the sun shine in m y mind.
But the mind will not be warmed, I can't
release it from the storm'). The 12" is
completely different (is this the same
song?) heavily featuring wah-wah guitar
and a typical dance drum beat, along
with lots of spacey, twirly noises. A n d
just as you are beginning to think this is
an instrumental and definitely not the
same song—in comes a few muffled,
Twist
—The Storm EP
subdued words and then a burst of the
chorus. She's Like a Rainbow (7") could
almost be mistaken for the original if it
wasn't for the added drum beat, whereas
the 12" adds numerous extra
instrumental bits. Considering the recent
popularity of the remixed Sympathy for
the Devil, this is sure to be at least
moderately successful.
So our verdict: all in all, really quite
good.
Pinky and Perky.
The Real
People
—Window Pane 12"
Loaded with dancy rhythms, loaded with
guitar driven melodies, loaded
with...loaded (Primal Scream).
Another dose of indie dance, but this
tastes surprisingly good. Using a proving
formula and doing it as good as anyone,
The Real People may have a winner
here.
I was hoping for something new, a
progression from the now year-old dance
crossover (perhaps an experiment in
superposition of drum tracks) but this will
do for now.
