IC II-2 QMW II-O
Four players and the kit decided to visit
the Lord Mayor's parade o n the w a y to
the game. T h e remainder, the Magnificent
Seven, arrived on time a n d waited for the
others...,and waited...,and waited.
Eventually with only the m i n i m u m time
allowed to play left, and the referee
refusing to referee the Magnificent Seven
in their underpants and boots, the cavalry
arrived. Q M W rather sportingly agreed to
play and then rather sportingly lost. A t a
hectic pace IC fitted 90 minutes into 70
and dominated. Goals from A Jolan and
D Cook earned IC the points. The only
questions remaining were ' h o w quickly
would the captain recover from his
nervous breakdown?' and 'how much
would the league fine IC?'.

OSC
Vandalism
A serious and distressing act of vandalism
was carried out last week in College
targetted at posters of the Friends of
Palestine Society. In total 31 posters were
willfully and discriminately removed, ten
from the JCR and 21 from the walkway.
The posters publicised a lecture that was
to take place on Thursday November 1.
The posters were put up o n Monday
November 29 between 1.00 and 2.00pm.
The Chief Security Officer (Mr Reeves),
and his assistant (Mr Briley), reported that
nothing was missing at around 5.00pm.
The next morning, the posters were gone.
The matter was taken up by the Union,
and the incident was reported to the
Rector, Sir Eric A s h . T h e U n i o n explained
that if the perpetrator was caught, severe
disciplinary action could be taken against
him, ranging from a fine, up to referring
him to the College disciplinary committee,
who have the power to suspend or expel.
The Overseas Student Committee
Chairman, Andreas Massourous, has stood
up in condemnation of the vandalism and
will pursue the matter personally.
Discriminate acts of vandalism on this
scale are extremely rare at Imperial, but
it is still w o r r y i n g that they should
happen at all. If y o u see anyone
suspiciously removing posters, or writing
comments on them, y o u must
immediately report it to the security
office in the Sherfield Building.
