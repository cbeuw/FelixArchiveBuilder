Dear Chris,
In Ireland, the belief is still widely held
that the most fundamental human right is
the right to life, whether the human i n
question be born or unborn, unlike in
mainland Britain where the monetarist
philosophy is so deeply entrenched that
an unplanned child is seen as nothing
more than an impediment to one's career
or quality of life and for w h i c h there is a

convenient and final solution freely
available.
If the situation i n Ireland is oppressive
now, it won't be for much longer. The
election of Mary Robinson as President
will mean big improvements in Irish
Women's rights in the next few years. If
any campaigning is required, it must be
to help remove the need for abortion, by
improved family planning services and
better welfare provision for the family.
Abortion is a n easy way of masking
inadequacies i n these areas, hence the
support given to this option by successive
governments and the ever compliant
media, which has succeeded in dictating
public opinion into acceptance of this
method of brushing these problems under
the carpet. Women's rights must be
improved, but this can be achieved
without abandoning the most fundamental
human right.
I would urge anyone intending to
support the Irish students to first seriously
consider their motives for doing so, and
above all I hope that IC Union remains
detached from both sides of the debate.
This should be a matter for individuals to
decide their o w n position, if IC Union
adopts a stance it will be guilty of the
excesses that disaffiliation from the NUS
was to avoid.
Yours,
Rob Crompton, Elec Eng 2.

Dear Sir,
First, m y replies. Communication i n
writing assumes the correct use of
vocabulary, Saleem Choudhery. If I were
to say that bananas are blue, it might be
due to a careless vocabulary, or it might
be because I honestly believed it to be
true. Mr A m i n El-Choly stated that the
idea of punishing Iraq (I assume this is
the political statement he refers to) would
offend the hostages and Kuwaitis. A s a
Briton, I sympathise with the hostages
held i n Kuwait and their relatives. But I
can honestly say that if I o r m y family
were held hostage, 1 would not give into
such terrorism because it grants a licence
to anyone to try it. Surely it's obvious
that one cannot give i n to terrorism? N o w
let's turn to those other hostages; the
Kuwaitis. W e hear o n the news of the
daily killing of Kuwaitis w h i c h has been
going on now for almost three months.
At a rate of o n e per day, that's 84 dead,
and I bet one per day is sublimely
optimistic. A s long as the rest of the
world allows Iraq to stay i n Kuwait,
Kuwaitis will die. Lots of them. What
A m i n El-Choly and Saleem Choudhery are
perhaps suggesting, is that w e should
allow the Kuwaitis to die i n order to free
the Britons. Perhaps you are white racists
yourselves.
As to the trivial discussion of 'Athena'
as a pseudonym (Amin El-Choly, issue
882). Athena was the daughter of Zeus
