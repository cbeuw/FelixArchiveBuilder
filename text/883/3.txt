Queensgate Alert N i l 4kkM\
A I M u W
Scores of people unwittingly risked
their lives last Friday by trying to watch
the Police deal with a suspected car
bomb in Queensgate.
After the car's alarm was set off, the
front of the Huxley building was
evacuated, but people in the higher floors
looked out of the windows. 'Car bombs
can create a phenomenal amount of
damage - people sticking their heads out
of windows could have had them blown
off, said Geoff Reeves, College Security
Officer. He added that-as the Kuwaiti and
Iraqi embassies are situated nearby, there
was cause for extra care.
Twenty metres of 2.5 inch copper
piping was stolen from the hydrant
supply of the Sherfield Building over the
week. 'This was dangerous and
irresponsible, it would have put
everybody at risk had there been a fire',
said College Security. Terry Briley of
security said that if the Fire Brigade had
been called to deal with a fire, they
would have had no water to fight it with.
Another car has been broken into at
the back of the Chemistry building. T w o
camera cases and test meters were stolen,
and the cases were recovered nearby.
•
More bicycles have been stolen, and the
Metroploitan Police have leafletted bicycle
owners around college warning them of
the dangers of theft. M r Briley added that
D-locks were still available from security
(ground floor of Sherfield) at £20.50.
A n y b o d y seeing anything suspicious,
whether possible theft or something more
sinister, should phone 3372 (security)
immediately.

There was a capacity audience and the
lecture lasted for well over an hour.
