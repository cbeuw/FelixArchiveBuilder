Dear Chris,
Since you refuse to publish m y response
to Konrad Pagenstert's personal and
vicious attack o n me, I a m writing to
inform m y fellow students of another
important issue.
I, like many of m y fellow patriotic
countrymen went to the Cenotaph last
Sunday, in order to honour our brave
war heroes and pay respect to those w h o
never returned. It was an extremely
moving and glorious occassion.
There was however one thing missing,
or should I say person. Prince Charles
that is. A n d where was he? In Japan, for
the enthronement of the n e w Emperor.
M y opinion of the Royal Family was
damaged, w h e n Prince Phillip went to
Hirohito's funeral to pay respect. Respect?
That nasty little Nip deserved N O respect.
He was the head of a country that
slaughtered, starved and butchered allied
soldiers. Prince Phillip should have said
'Good Riddance', instead of b o w i n g his
head.
N o w w e have Charles—like father like
son 1 suppose. Charles, w h o refused to go
to the Battle of Britain ceremony earlier
this year because of his b a d arm. I hope
he felt guilty w h e n he saw brave war
heroes marching o n ceremony, one of
w h o m had lost a n arm. T h e y didn't
bugger off w h e n their country needed
them at 'Our finest hour'.
By Charles' actions at the weekend, he

has for me, recognised m y worst fears.
He obviously prefers the company of
plants and trees to British people. H e will
give up his time to make a video in order
to stop a few acres of rain forest from
being felled, but when it comes to
honouring British war heroes he refuses.
Prince Charles' actions are at the very
least insensitive and insulting, and at the
worst close to treachery. I cannot express
m y disgust at his actions so I will quote
from the chairman of the war vets
association. H e said 'Let's hope that
Charles and D i don't get the same
welcome as w e and m y colleagues did.
That is starvation, beatings and
beheadings'.
Charlie boy prefers to spend
remembrance day in a country that
butchered our lads and was (some might
say still is) our enemy. A country w h o
just last week slaughtered a few 1,000
dolphins and then said that they just
happened to commit mass suicide o n a
handy Nippon beach, where they were
hacked to pieces of profit. Yes, of course
they did. Just as the war heroes of our
great country volunteered to build
bridges and had a wonderful time i n their
brutal P o W camps.
A n d if you believe that, you'll believe
that Konrad Pagenstern talks a lot of
sense.
Yours,
Alan Bailey, Chem 2.

Dear FELIX,
The nationalist government of China
never attempted to introduce democracy.
It was responsible for several bloody
massacres. Before W o r l d W a r II it openly
modelled itself o n Fascism, people who
oppose the current regime o n libertarian
grounds need have no sympathy with the
nationalists.
The cultural revolution was supposed to
move power away from the bureaucrats
and party elite, to ordinary people where
it belonged. Unfortunately M a o was afraid
to let it get 'out of control'. H e thought
that democracy had to be balanced b y
strong leadership. H e suppressed people's
grievances against those elements of the
party and the state that were the real
enemies of the people, because of the
supposed need for 'unity'.
There is no reason to believe that
workers' and peasants' self-organisation
could not have dispensed with the state
altogether, and prevented the
transformation into capitalism that has
been brutally forced o n the Chinese
people since Mao's death.
By giving some people power over
others, the state creates the opportunity
for personal corruption. T h e state, low
wages and high prices are necessary to
create the profits that capitalism (the
exploitation of people b y a parasitic
ruling elite) demands. But capitalism is
not necessary.
Yours sincerely,
Jason Pike.
