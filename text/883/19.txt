Bift!
Last week over three days saw the
proceedings of the United Kingdom
Conference on Overseas Students
Association. Paul Shanley, your president,
attended as the representative of Imperial
College Union a n d we give a brief run
d o w n on his actions. This report being in
response to his challenge last week for
me to find out as m u c h as possible
through m y spy network.
W e start with the train journey to
Leeds o n Monday. Here Paul managed to
find a Turrettes Syndrome case to sit
opposite. His vocal emanations were not
as bad as some. Instead of uttering
obscenities in abstract manner he would
instead whelp, growl and bark. So put off
by this outrageous display, Paul had to
make a move and decided to mask the
action by pretending to leave the train at
the next station. N o w seated in the other
carriage he could still hear his previous
seat-mates calls and waited in anticipation
for the ticket collector...
For the rest of the journey Paul w o r k e d
upon his U G M report and the induction
notes for the n e w Union Manager, Mandy
Hurford.
A r r i v i n g at Leeds he settled in at the
hotel but didn't meet his r o o m mate.
Being a good b o y he attended all his
seminars before going out in the evening
to get pissed. This he did without any
problem, as y o u might imagine.
His enjoyment of the evening drink was
obviously far too m u c h for h i m to take
and he soon had to retire to bed. A t this
point he still had not met his r o o m mate.
Mark Crawley concludes from his
observations that M r Shanley has no
stamina. Upon each night w h e n returning
to their r o o m he found h i m already fast
asleep. A n d , when Mark a w o k e and got
up Shan was still virtually asleep. His
mumblings unintelligible a n d his eyes
looking knackered. A t this point he still
had not managed to introduce himself to
his room-mate.
Part w a y through the second day Mark
approached M r Shanley and enquired
whether he had been disturbed when he
got in last night or earlier o n this
morning. Shan looked perplexed. W h o
was this person. Suddenly, at last, it all
became apparent. This was his room-mate
that he had tried to communicate with
earlier. Unfortunately y o u see, Shan
wears contact lenses and without them is
bat-like, as it were. Finally Mark pointed
out to me that 'he's got a hell of a
snore.'.
O n the second day the business came
and went m u c h as it had the day before.
The evening itself started in pretty m u c h
the same w a y until the pool games
began. This apparently innocuous game
had the effect of speeding the alcohol
through his system. During one phase he
lined up a shot which took him about ten
minutes. After this intense bout of
concentration he stood up, as best he
could, and asked the question ' A m 1 spots
or stripes'. F r o m n o w o n our very o w n
pool hall hustler would be k n o w n as
'Stripes'.
The evening wore on and the stomachs
wore out. Midnight came around and the
munchies paid a visit. It was agreed that
sometime soon a curry w o u l d have to be
sought. Later, not wishing to strain
himself b y venturing outside, Shan had a
'bizarre idea'. Fridges were to be raided,
as in the tradition of Evelyn Gardens and,
1 suppose, all other college residences. H e
wandered off and didn't return, despite
the fact that the others continued with
their game until 3 o'clock. T h e next
morning he had no better explanation
than just having a walk to freshen up. His
colleagues believe that a w a l k to the
toilet was more in order considering his
pale face.
Chris Hayes, one of his social
colleagues, said that he was 'not a great
socialiser' and that he was 'a bit of let
down' for the ICU side. H e added that he
had been promised a copy of a couple of
videos Rainbow and Playschool but had
not heard from h i m .
Finally, after his hard w o r k on the
train, he managed to leave his U G M
report and Mandy's induction notes in
Leeds, probably due to his excessive
drinking. 1 would also just like to thank
Mr Shanley in advance for cleaning the
floors of m y offices, as agreed as his
forfeit.
