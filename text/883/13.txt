Ladies Hockey
The ladies 1st X I had a successful week
winning all three of their matches.
Wednesday's game against Sussex was to
be the make or break of the U A U for the
team. It was vital that they w o n to stand
a chance of reaching the next round. T h e
game was v e r y equal and produced the
best hockey played this term. Lisa Preedy
scored the w i n n i n g goal within the first
ten minutes of the match by taking it
from before the halfway line. IC defence
was strong while the forwards had
several more shots at goal a n d were
unlucky not to score again.
T h e match o n Saturday was a
Middlesex league match against O l d
Kingstonians I. Imperial were slow to get
into the game and did not play to their
true ability. However, after the first 15
minutes, IC began to control the match
and this was secured by K a r e n Young's
goal. T h e second goal was scored from a
short corner with an excellent strike by
Jane Bunch. Final score.: 2-0 to Imperial.
Finally o n Sunday, IC played the first
round of the U L Cup. Without the usual
1st X I team, IC managed to w i n by 3-0.
The score does not reflect the game as
Royal Free I were strong opposition and
had numerous shots at goal.
Congratulations must go to the IC goalie,
Alison Franklin, for not letting in a goal
all week.
Football
IC IV-3 Goldsmith's III - 1
As the match got underway, the cocky
opposition were stunned into silence. IC
immediately gained the initiative, and
deservedly took the lead 5 minutes later
w h e n John Mottashed scored with a
cracking 30 y a r d shot. IC piled on the
pressure and, with probably the best
passing move of the day, K e v M c C a n n set
up a simple tap in for John's second.
After the teams changed ends, K e v
should have wrapped things up. Instead
he performed one of rugby's better
converted kicks from which the
opposition pulled back a scrappy goal and
pushed for the equaliser. Things began to
look ominous a n d with ten minutes
remaining, their centre-forward broke
through squeezing the ball, past IC's
stranded keeper, towards the goal. T h e
worst seemed inevitable until D a m o n
Thomas accomplished an astonishing slide
to scoop the ball off the line.
Encouraged by this, IC pressed forward
and Gary M a h o n e y curled i n a beautiful
free kick to finish off a brilliant all-round
team performance.

Wu-Shu-Kwan
Mark Howser Maths III became the W u -
Shu-Kwan British Kickboxing Champion
on Sunday October 28, competing in the
six monthly Wu-Shu-Kwan tournament in
Surbiton Surrey.
His first fight proved his toughest, being
knocked d o w n in the first round. A l l o w e d
to continue M a r k recovered superbly and
half-way through the second round his
opponent drained and, unable to
continue, surrendered to a technical
knockout.
Next came the semi-final and a draw
against the reigning champion Dave
Finch. The fight was fast a n d furious
resulting with Finch flat on the canvas
inside the first round and M a r k a place in
the final.
At the end of the long tournament it
was time for the finals and M a r k entered
the ring full of confidence. After only 90
seconds of the first round, a n d following
a ruthlessly powerful assault by Mark, his
opponent was flat on his face.
This left Mark the first ever champion,
in any weight division, to come from
Imperial College and all of the club looks
forward to seeing him defend his title in
six months time.
Swimming
On Friday November 2 a sponsored swim,
in aid of the National A s t h m a Campaign,
took place at Imperial College S w i m m i n g
Pool. A l t h o u g h the turn-out was a little
disappointing, especially amongst club
members, the event was a success with
over £750 being raised.
Many thanks to those w h o pledged
money, and to those w h o eventually took
part. W e hope to have the money
collected, and passed on, soon so if
everyone 'pays up' quickly it would be a
great help.
Cross Country
It was with some trepidation that the
normally confident, blase, x-country team
arrived at Guildford, scene of the second
installment of the soap opera that is the
London Colleges League. Not only did the
course have a reputation of severely cold
death, but some splendidly erratic
minibus driving had reduced several of
the team into nervous wrecks well before
the starting gun had been fired. With
several first-team stalwarts mysteriously
missing, the opposition m a y have sensed
a whiff of a possible upset. However,
within the first mile, Paul Northrop had
posed a question no one in the 130
strong field could answer. Despite
claiming to have had a b a d run, he was
never headed and charged away to his
second win. Frank Dudbridge and A l e x
Gaskell enjoyed a ding-dong encounter
behind him, their personal battle
eventually taking its toll as they were
passed in the later stages. League veteran
Frank staggered in 7th, with the younger
A l e x plodding home 8th. Bill Skailes,
wearing a suspiciously new t-shirt,
managed 29th, and Laurence Fowkes,
minus his appendix, 38th; a good
performance since racing is all about
guts. T h e combined points enabled IC to
head the League at this race, and thus
extend its savage overall lead.
The women's team were placed fourth
overall, after Edwige Pitel, in an
inexplicable fit of keenness, overshot the
finish by 200 metres and lost 12 places
before collecting her disc. This enabled
Helen Macintosh to nip in and claim 13th,
Edwige winding up i "th, Keri Warden-
O w e n 28th and Sonya Legg 31st. A death
of attitude restricted the second men's
team to just three runners and thus the
early floundering of their promotion
campaign; however Dave Budgett's 64th
place gave h i m enough points to
encroach onto the individual's leader
board.
