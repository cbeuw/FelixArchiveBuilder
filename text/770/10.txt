Orson
Welles
at IC
This Thursday (14th) IC FilmSoc
presents Citizen Kane, in Mech Eng
220 (doors at 7.30pm. admission free
to members).
Shortly after the success of his vivid
radio dramatisation of The War ofthe
Worlds, which panicked the whole of
America, Orson Welles. America's
boy wonder, launched himself into
cinema.
In Citizen Kane. Welles' first film,
he directed, produced, co-wrote and
starred. Although not a commercial
success at first (1941), even though
it won two Oscars and received 5
nominations, the film was soon re-
released and became a smash hit. By
1962 the British Film Institute poll of
international critics had voted it the
greatest film of all time and every poll
since it has led the second place film
(La Regie du Jeu) by a larger and
larger margin.
"Then last week, as it must to all
men, death came to Charles Foster
Kane."
The film revolves round a magazine
reporter who interviews the friends of
the dead newspaper tycoon, Kane, in
an effort to discover the meaning of
his last words. The film mirrors the
life of William Randolf Hurst who,
in the first third of this century, was
one of the most powerful men in
America. Hurst spent a fortune trying
to make a star out of his actress-lover
Marion Davies, and their high profile
affair was hot news for many years.
Kane is a brilliant piece of
Hollywood cinema, using all the
resources of the studio, and despite
lapses of characterisation almost
every shot and every line are utterly
absorbing.
Here are what some more
respectable critics thought:
"On seeing it for the first time, one
got the conviction that if cinema could
do that, it could do anything"—
Penelope Huston
"Probably the most exciting film
that has come out of Hollywood for
twenty-five years. I am not sure it
isn't the most exciting film that has
ever come out of anywhere"—C A
Lejeune
"More fun than any great movie I
can think of"—Pauline Kad
All members (and non-members)
should not miss this opportunity to see
one of the greatest films ever.

Price £1.00 for non-members.
Abba and G O'Sullivan
Tonight, Friday May 8th, Ents are
presenting the 7-piece band Hookline
& Silverfish in the Lounge. The band
have been described as a cross
between Elvis Costello and Aztec
Camera and their history includes a
gig at the 100 Club which was
attended by a selection of record
company representatives; which
means they are as hot as a cross
between the Smiths and a blowtorch.
Moving further into the term, Ents,
in conjunction with IC Rag, will be
running a Comedy Cabaret Night on
Saturday May 16th, again in the
Lounge, with a very cheap bar. Acts
appearing include Scottish satirical
singer-songwriter Tom McEwan,
juggler and funny man Steve Rowlings
(whose appearances include Saturday
Live) and the Music Hall Cabaret,
who describe themselves as a bawdy
trip back to the good old days. All
this, coupled with intermittent jazz
should ensure a jolly wild jape (and
some hints of wheeze).
On a more general note, the sad
demise of Ents activity this year
increases the importance of having a
good committee next year to revive
involvement in Union events. Whilst
the Ents chairman has been elected,
a number of posts are available and
anyone can stand for them (Ents is not
a clique of hardy students—we think
Abba and G O'Sullivan have really
injected life into the music business).
The posts are as follows:
a) Secretary
b) Junior Treasurer
c) Disco Officer
d) Publicity Officer
e) 8 Ordinary Members (four
freshers)
All C C U Ents officers are
automatically members of the
committee. It is important that they
attend meetings to prevent events
clashing unnecessarily.
Election papers will be going up in
the next few days. Anyone interested
should contact J Noble (Chem Eng
IV) via the Ents pigeon hole in the
Union Office.
Ladies Rugby Tour Report
Ladies overpower Oysters
At the end of last term the Ladies
Rugby Team went on tour to Holland.
There were two matches played, of
which IC lost the first, but came back
to win in the second.
In retrospect it is not surprising that
we lost the first match to the
Eindhoven 'Elephants', after ten
hours travelling and only two hours
sleep. Seven tries were conceeded in
the first half, but we woke up in the
second half, only conceeded a further
twelve points and came close to
scoring a number of times ourselves.
The next day the snow disappeared
and it became warm and sunny.
Despite the fact that a number of
players had great difficulty in holding
down their breakfast (and one didn't
suceed) on the journey to the pitch
after the previous nights activities, we
were a much improved side when we
played the Oisterwijk 'Oysters'. The
teams were quite evenly matched, but
the speed of wing Sabrina Demello
proved to be our strength and IC
scored two tries in the first half, one
oeing converted by Abygail Samuels.
This'made the half-time score 10—0.
The Oysters scored a breakaway try
near the beginning of the second half
as we relaxed slightly, But this proved
to be their only score and after
consistent pressure we scored a try
from a penalty move close to the line:
final score, a 14—4 win.
Easter
rowing
THE EIGHTS HEAD
After watching Oxford win the Boat
Race, the 5 College crews then raced
on the falling tide to again
demonstrate their dominance in
university rowing, against 500
international, club and university
crews.
The first eight improved on last
year's position and came 9th overall,
winning the Ortner Shield for the
fastest UAU crew, and coming in the
top three of the British club crews.
The second eight also excelled
winning the UAU Trophy for the
fastest second UAU crew. Possibly
the best result w as the winning of the
Novice Pennant by the 'beginners' of
the club who have only been rowing
for 6 months.
SCULLERS HEAD
11th April
This is the top long distance sculling
race in the country and was attended
by over 500 scullers including many
British and foreign World
Championship medalists. It was here
that the boat club had its best ever
result by a sculler when Nick Barfitt
won the whole event, much to his
surprise, after having a very good
scull over the 4 'A mile course.
BEDFORD SMALL
BOATS HEAD
12th April
Here the stars of the day were, yet
again, the novices, who won the
novice coxed fours and coxed pairs.
The coxed pair's win was most
remarkable as they were coxed by our
coach Bill Mason who was larger than
either of the two crew members. He
then went on to win in a veteran
coxless four with his old friends. The
other wins at Bedford were in Senior
B coxless pairs and Senior C sculls.
DAF and CHANNEL 4
POWER SPRINTS
4th May
This event is the first rowing event
specially organised for television. It
is to be shown on Channel 4 on
Sunday evenings during the summer.
The race is a 500m timed trial with
the fastest four crews from the heats
going through to the semi-finals.
After the heats the first eight had the
third fastest time which put them into
the semi-finals. Here they raced the
Tideway Scullers School, supposedly
the top club in the country, but after
a hard fought race beat Tideway by
% of a length, giving IC the fastest
time of the day (also beating the
University of London crew) and
winning themselves a place in the
grand final at Bristol on the May Bank
Holiday.
