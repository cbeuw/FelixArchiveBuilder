Silwood: Spot the Ball!
Young, gifted and unemployed
The Commission for Racial Equality
has published a report which shows
that students who are black or from
other ethnic minorities find it more
difficult to get jobs after graduation
than those who are white. In addition
they receive lower wages, and are less
likely to be offered a job suitable for
their qualifications.
The report was based on a sample
of 2,640 recent polytechnic graduates,
and shows that, whereas only 30% of
the white students were unemployed
a year after graduation, this rose to
over a half for non-whites.
Students of Asian descent were
particularly badly hit, with an
unemployment rate double that for
whites, and average salaries £30 per
week less even though they tended to
study in fields such as engineering and
pharmacy which are more
vocationally orientated. Even Asian
electronics graduates "seemed to be
experiencing considerable difficulty
in finding any form of suitable
employment'', with only half finding
jobs in a year, compared to 14 out of
15 whites. The report says that these
differences could not be explained by
differences in degree class.
Dr Russ Clark is the head of the
careers service at Imperial College.
He said that he was surprised by the
report's findings, and that the
differences could be caused by other
factors—interview techniques for
instance. If there was discrimination
then he believed it happened at
individual interviews. He said that if
any student felt that they were being
discriminated against then he would
be ready to help. Careers services
could refuse to handle the literature
of employers if necessary.
In two years he had received only
one complaint about racially
prejudiced recruitment, from a Jewish
student who had decided not to take
the matter further.
The standard application forms
used for graduate recruitment include
a question on ethnic background
which is designed to allow employers
to monitor their recruitment to see if
it is racially unfair. However this
section could also be used tofilterout
non-white students early in the
recruitment in a way that would make
discrimination almost impossible to
prove. This section is voluntary, and
some students refuse to complete it.
"It is up to each student to make their
own decision about this", Dr Clark
said, "It is a rather grey area".
Although the careers service
handles these forms and could do its
own monitoring of recruitment of
ethnic minorities, this is not done
because it is felt that the requirements
of absolute confidentiality must be
respected, and some students from
ethnic backgrounds might not want
such monitoring. For these reasons a
decision has been made recently that
the recruitment of disabled students
would not be checked.
Another
ceiling
collapses
A section of ceiling collapsed in one
of the resident's rooms in Southwell
House last week. At about 11.15pm
last Thursday a 3' x 2' section of
plaster crashed from the ceiling of one
of the ground floor rooms and landed
on a bed. Fortunately both the
occupants of the room were out at the
time.
Warden Ken Young said that.the
resident whose bed it was had had a
lucky escape, as the section that fell
had been 'substantial'. He said that
the room had been in such a state that
the two occupants had been put up in
temporary rooms while the damage
was cleared. Mr Young went on to
say that Southwell residents were
particularly concerned about the
safety of the ceilings in view of a
similar incident in Holbein in the
autumn term. He was unhappy with
the extent to which the ceilings had
been checked and went on to say it
was important for the safety of
students that a full survey be carried
out. Southwell and Holbein are both
among the Evelyn Gardens houses
which were upgraded during the
summer, although this did not involve
structural work.
Peter Hallworth, Managing
Surveyor of Residences said, when
asked for comment, that he had
examined the damage personally but
had no idea why the collapse had
occured. He said that with the age of
the Evelyn Gardens houses this sort
of thing was to be expected. In the
case of the Holbein incident the
plaster had been weakened by leaking
water but this was not the case in
Southwell. Mr Hallworth said that he
did not believe any further survey was
necessary and that anyway it would
be impractical to move students out
of their rooms en masse.
