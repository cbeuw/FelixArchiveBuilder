A service of
STAI
TheWorldbeaters
• This is it! It's the last one—this
is YOUR chance to win a holiday
for two. And not only that, but
with the sponsorship of STA we
are able to give you a choice of
a weekend in either Paris or
Amsterdam.
• This is the final week of the competition and, as usual, there is a
£10 travel voucher prize for the first correct entry (drawn from a hat)
to the two questions below. We have also reprinted all the previous
questions and photographs—you can still enter for the main prize if
you submit answers to the complete set of ten questions by 5.30pm
today (Friday). Don't worry if you can't answer all the questions or
identify all the photos—submit an entry anyway because probably no-
one else will either.
The draw for the winner will take place at 4.00pm tomorrow at the
Rag Fete and the result printed in next week's FELIX, along with all
the answers.
• Don't miss this chance of a lifetime!
• Previous questions and photos are:
Week 1 Who was the Rector of Imperial College before Lord Flowers?
Mystery photo 1
Week 2 Who was the first President of IC Union?
Mystery photo 2
• This week's questions are;
1) What part of College is this?
2) Where is the Colcutt Tower?
t The fourth amazingly lucky winner was Mark Ball of Chemistry
III (again).
• All entries to be addressed to the FELIX Office and marked "STA
Competition". For further information, contact either FELIX or Mark
Fletcher in the STA Office on level 2 of the Sherfield Building.
Week 3 When was the Union Building extended?
