FELIX FELIX, Friday May 8th 1987 14
Who is
Tony
Neal?
Anthony Neal (pictured) is in his first
year studying Electrical Engineering
at Imperial. He is also one of the most
gifted young trombonists around, and
on Friday he is performing
Grondahl's Trombone Concerto with
Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra.
Tony began learning the trombone
at the age of 12. In 1981 he won a
Junior Music Exhibition Award from
Essex County Council to study at the
Royal College of Music Junior
Department. As well as playing in the
Essex Youth Orchestra and the Royal
College of Music Junior Orchestra he
has been principal trombone of the
National Children's Orchestra and is
now principal of the National Youth
Orchestra. His most recent concert
with the NYO was at the end of April
in the Royal Albert Hall when their
programme included Eine
Alpensinfonie by Richard Strauss.
Tony shot to national fame last year
when he won first prize in the brass
section of the BBC's Young Musician
of the Year competition, beating
hundreds of other musicians of over
Grade 8 standard to become the best
brass player under 19 in the country.
In the final he played the Grondahl
Trombone Concerto on national
television with the BBC Philharmonic
Orchestra conducted by Bryden
Thompson.
Although he is studying Electrical
Engineering, Tony still finds time to
take a very active part in music at IC.
He is a member of ICSO and Imperial
Brass, and is often seen performing
Here's the answer to the last problem
of last term. Plenty of correct
solutions although there seemed to be
a bit of confusion about some of the
clues: 1-across was 'A multiple of
11-across' many answers did not
satisfy this condition, and 1-down
read 'Odd. Each digit is greater than
the preceding one.'—this was meant
to indicate that the digits should
increase as you read down the page.
The £5 prize winner was Nick
Blatchley, Maths II, well done! The
summer term is a pretty lean one for
Megabrain, with exams taking up
most people's spare thinking time, so
there won't be a new problem this
week. Look out for one later this term
with IC's Trombone Trio which plays
almost anything (from The Queen of
Sheba by Handel to Those
Magnificent Men in Their Flying
Machines) almost anywhere.
Tony considers the little-known
concerto by Grondahl to be the best
one written. It was composed in 1924
and demands a high level of technical
and musical competence from both
soloist and orchestra. Your chance to
though, and the special problems page
in the end-of-year issue.
hear it is on Friday May 15th in the
Great Hall at 8.00pm and it will only
cost you £1. Not only can you hear
the Concerto for Trombone, but we
are also performing Mozart's Magic
Flute Overture, a brass Fanfare from
La Peri by Dukas, and the Symphony
Number 8 by Dvorak, which he wrote
shortly before his New World
Symphony.

This term saw what might (very
arguably) be described as the
highlight of the IC social calendar—
Silwood Ball. Though those who
attended may have looked charming
and elegant, their doings were on the
whole, far from respectable.
Perhaps the most shocking tale
concerned a young Aeronautical
Engineer, called Sasha, who threw
herself, ballgown and all, into a pond.
After wandering around for some
time in a sodden dress decorated with
algae, she was persuaded to change
into her coat, but in doing so noticed
she had lost a shoe, probably in the
pond. A nameless female friend,
when asked to retrieve it, decided not
to do to her ballgown what the
unfortunate Sasha had done. For this
reason she took off her dress, much
to the delight of Dramsoc who viewed
her braless form with admiration from
a first floor window. David
Isherwood, not content with a balcony
seat, rushed down to 'assist' the
young woman with her quest. It is
rumoured that he will formally
reinstate 'Ogle Soc' some time this
term.
An only slightly less embarassing
event which occurred at Silwood was
the engagement of former ladies' man
Mark Ball to Stephanie Snell after
they had been going out for little more
than a term. Undisclosed sources
would lay 5:1 against a marriage ever
taking place.
By the way, it anyone from
'Alchemica Acta' is reading, they're
welcome to it, but they're not
welcome!
