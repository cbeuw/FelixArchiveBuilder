ULU saved
from UGC
hatchet men
The University of London Union has
been saved from the massive cuts
which were threatened by the UGC.
Though the figures still have to be
finally approved by the Senate next
year, ULU will receive an increase
of 3.6% in funding.
This news is being heralded as a
major success for the campaign to
defend central services which was
organised by ULU last term. The
"biggest campaign ever run by
U L U " included collecting a petition
of 13,000 signatures and a Day of
Action, which was held in January.
The future of all of the University's
central services now seems more
secure. The Careers Advisory Service
will also receive an increase of 3.6%.
The Accommodation Office and the
Central Institution Health Centre will
receive increases of 3.5% and 3.7%
respectively. The Library and the
Department of Extra-Mural Studies
will be granted smaller increases.
The Universities Grants Committee
have sent officers at ULU an apology
for the original statement about cuts
in central funding. The Senate of the
University of London have passed
policy backing the maintenance of
student amenities.
ULU have published a report on
"The Future of Student Amenities in
the Federal University" based on
information gathered in the campaign,
which points out that student facilities
in London are still underfunded.
Postal strike havoc
90,000 addresses were without mail
earlier this week as almost all Post
Office sorting staff in south west
London went on strike.
The unofficial dispute started in
Brixton postal district (SW2) where,
because of a high sickness rate
amongst staff, a backlog of mail had
built up. Staff were either unable, or
not unwilling, to work the overtime
necessary to clear the backlog. The
district post master tried to get
trainees in from a neighbouring
district to do the deliveries. This
course of action had previously been
agreed with the Union of
Communication Workers (UCW), but
as soon as the idea was put forward,
the postal workers walked out. Other
postal districts' workers also walked
out throughout the week in a show of
sympathy for the Brixton district.
these districts being Clapham (SW4),
Stockwell (SW9) and Earl's Court
(SW5) and South Lambeth (SW8).
A Post Office spokesman said that
they ' 'deeply regret the inconvenience
caused to the public as a result of this
unofficial strike action." He also told
FELIX that there are many standard
procedures by which the UCW can
communicate with management to
sort out any dispute without causing
inconvenience to the public.
"Obviously the postal workers in
Brixton have ignored these
procedures" FELIX was told.
As a result of negotiations on
Tuesday and Wednesday, normal
services were resumed throughout
south west London on Thursday
morning, although FELIX was told
that it would take up to a week to clear
all the backlog of mail.
First for the Scarlet Woman
The RCS Motor Club admitted to
having a fun-packed bank holiday
weekend. The burly bunch of fire-
persons were out every day,
exhibiting Jezebel the fire engine.
On Saturday the team took Jez to
Battersea Park to be filmed for the
BBC TV programme Top Gear. The
show was running a feature on the
Historic Commercial Vehicles
Society annual outing to Brighton in
which Jez took part. The interviewer,
Mr William Woolard, admitted to the
crew that he had once used the ladies
toilets at Imperial and to having been
suitably impressed by the low
standard of grafitti.
Sunday saw Jez successfully
'completing the trip with only a minor
mechanical problem when a fan blade
sheared off. However, she made it to
Brighton and back again without any
further problems.
The highlight of the weekend was
on Monday at the "Wheels of
Yesterday Rally' in Battersea Park.
Here Jez was awarded first prize in
the class of Fire and Rescue Vehicles,
and was presented with a nifty silver
trophy.
