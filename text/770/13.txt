DROOD
THE SOLVE IT YOURSELF MUSICAL
SAVOY THEATRE
Stagefright are excellent live around
College I'm told, with a live set
consisting of "well known kick-ass
rock covers surrounding the bands
own material played with energy,
power and enthusiasm". Well they
have recently visited a 24-track
recording studio and recorded a
demo-tape.
You can't fault their enthusiasm—
this lot enjoy playing. The two tracks
on the tape are the bands own
material, resisting the temptation to
record a cover on their first tape. All
the usual you would expect from a
'rock' band is there, incessant guitar
and drums, but what really lifts it for
me are the lead vocals; they really are
quite special.
The overall style, despite the rock
style, can't help but remind me of
Jools Holland's band, Squeeze—the
vocals are very similar. Where it does
fall down a bit is with the drums. I'm
told they used a drum sampler, and
they didn't quite get it right. Especially
during the first track on the demo it's

not clear whether the drums are even
accompanying the right track.
OK, it's a little rough around the
edges, but that's what demo tapes are
about. It's worth a listen, definitely, or
even better get to see them live—
you'll enjoy it!

Last Saturday I went to see a rather
dreary performance of The Mystery of
Edwin Drood at the Savoy Theatre,
The Strand. The plot is based on
Charles Dickens' unfinished novel,
where young ED disappears and
various inhabitants of the local town
fall under suspicion. The audience are
called upon to give their (rigged) vote
on the ending, which is then acted out
The company pretended to be a
fifth-rate musical company, a pretence
that did not stretch the imagination.
The experienced performers were
obvious—you could hear them. It was
sad to see Ernie Wise, Lulu and the
other passable actors prostituting their
talents to a bit of West End musical
that was neither highly amusing, nor
musical, nor well-acted, nor with any
sign of a credible script. This is the
kind of thing we send American
tourists to (poor things) to earn our
foreign exchange.

FILM
Crimes of the heart
Crimes ofthe Heart is a hilarious black
comedy which gives three of the best
screen actresses of the decade a
chance to go wonderfully over the top,
playing eccentric (if not insane) sisters,
who refuse to conform to the rules of
their community.
Babe (Sissy Spacek) has just shot her
husband because she "didn't like his
stinking looks", Meg (Jessica Lange) is
a failed singer who drinks too much
and admits freely to having had far
more men that is good for her. Lenny
(Diane Keaton) nurses their
grandfather and avoids men as she
believes that they will reject her
because she has a shrunken ovary.
The film concentrates almost
entirely on the three central
performances. It quickly rushes past
the more serious points that the
original play raised, such as hypocrisy
and racism in the American South
(Babe has an adulterous affair with a
young black boy who is quickly sent
away by the authorities when it
becomes public). Bruce Bresford's
direction sometimes wavers
somewhere between the drama and
the humour of situations such as
Babe's string of failed attempts at
suicide.
However all of the film's faults are
more than compensated for by Lange,
Spacek and Keaton's performances as
the sisters who love, laugh, scream
and cry together when nobody else
will accept them.

FILM
Platoon
One of the most publicised films of the
year, mainly, one suspects, due to its
unexpected financial success in the
US, is Oliver Stone's Platoon. Yet
another film about Vietnam, you ask?
Well, to a certain extent it is just
another film about Vietnam, although
admittedly a very well made one.
The plot is quite simple: the
experiences of one U.S. recruit,
starting from his first day in the battle
zone. Charlie Sheen (looking
incredibly like his father in Apocalypse
Now) plays Chris, a college drop-out
who naively decides to 'fight for his
country' and becomes one of the few
Vietnam volunteers. The platoon of
the title is that to which Sheen is
assigned, a hardened, unfriendly
bunch who, although believably
played, seem a bit cliched: the wimpy
Lieutenant, battle weary Sergeant,
resident wierdo...etc. Sheen soon
realises his mistake, as a new recruit
he is not only given the worst jobs, but
his life is worth less since he has no
experience. As the film continues he
is exposed to some of the other
horrors of the war: night ambushes,
booby traps, napalm, VC (Viet-Cong)
villages levelled and girls raped.
The comparisons with Apocalypse
Now are inevitable. The films both
have a similar atmosphere and both
portray the war in a black and
unglorified way. They differ in that
Platoon tells the story of the standard
infantrymen ( who were usually the
poor and uneducated men of the
U.S.—one of the original points the
film makes) in their day-to-day
activities, although there is plenty of
'action' of course.
Platoon is professionaly made and
is certainly exciting enough if a war
adventure is what you're looking for,
but in the end I felt that I had learnt
little new about the Vietnam conflict,
or the suffering of the people involved.
Platoon is presently playing at the
Odeon Leicester Square and around
London.
