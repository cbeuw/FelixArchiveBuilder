Or " a
Miner's
guide to
voting in
ICU
elections''
by Dave
Colley
For the forthcoming election for
President of ICU there are five
candidates in the running. There
could be an election held whereby the
candidate with the most votes wins on
the first count ie majority win on the
first past the post candidate. This,
however, is not the case in ICU
elections. In ICU elections a form of
proportional representation known as
the single transferable vote (STV) is
employed to elect a majority winner.
The process starts with you, the
voter...
There are five candidates running
for the election. On the days leading
up to the election you will
undoubtedly read their publicity and
ask them questions. The forum for
asking questions is the hustings ie
yesterday, however there is nothing
to stop you approaching a candidate
to ask more detailed questions
yourselves.
On the polling days there will be
a ballot box positioned in all
departments. On production of your
Union Card you will be given one
ballot paper with the five candidates'
names on it in alphabetical order.
Next to each candidate is a shortened
down form of voting instructions.
When voting put the figures 1,-2,
3, 4 & 5 in the boxes in order of your
preference ie:
Candidate 1 3
Candidate 2 $
Candidate 3 %
Candidate 4 i
Candidate 5 4-
If in your opinion Candidate 2 is the
best for the job put' 1' in the box next
to Candidate 2 (see above). Then put
'2' next to your next best candidate
and so on until you get to '5', or you
don't want to vote for any of the
remaining candidates (leave the
remaining boxes blank).
If, in your opinion, none of the
candidates are worthy of the post of
Union President next year, then you
may register a vote against all the
candidates by writing 'ABSTAIN'
across the ballot paper.
This is all you have to do to vote,
and here is a short summary:
1. Get off your backside on either
the 12th or 13th of May ie this coming
Tuesday or Wednesday and wander
into College, any department will do,
or if you live in Princes Gardens use
the box in the Southside Upper
Lounge.
2. Take your Union Card with you
to show you are a registered IC
student.
3. Vote for as many of the
candidates as you want, using the
numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 to indicate
order of preference, or abstain by
writing 'ABSTAIN' on the ballot
paper (if any other mark is made on
the paper ie scribbling out and starting
again the vote is spoiled).
DO NOT VOTE WITH A CROSS.
