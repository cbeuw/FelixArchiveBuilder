News FELIX, Friday May 8th 1987 3
Appalling prospectus
The Imperial College Alternative
Prospectus for entry in 1988 and 1989
arrived in the FELIX Office on
Wednesday night. When examined by
the AP Editor, Sunny Bains, it was
found that the printers of Preston, had
used the wrong kind of paper for the
covers and had not allowed the ink to
dry before stacking. In addition they
had not cropped the booklets,
allowing holes in the edges of the
paper, produced during the printing
process, to show on the finished
articles, and had generally produced
a very low standard of finish.
After Ms Bains complained, a
representative of Hamilton Press
agreed to take £200 from a total bill
of £1885 to compensate for the error
in the covers, but was non-committal
as to whether further reductions could
be made for the other printing faults.
The total number of booklets
delivered was 200 less than it should
have been, and at the time of writing
it appears likely that ten percent of the
remaining will be unusable due to an
error in folding.
The usable copies are to be included
in the Sherfield mailing next Monday
or Tuesday; it is expected that this
will be about six thousand.
Ms Bains said that reprinting was
out of the question, as the Sherfield
deadline had to be met if the AP were
to be distributed by College, and the
cost of separate distribution by ICU
would be prohibitively expensive.
New Welfare
Adviser
College has recently appointed Mr
Iain More as Director of Public
Relations. The main responsibility of
this new post is to provide an effective
fund-raising programme for College.
It is envisaged that such a programme
will involve new contacts outside
College, as well as further fund-
raising from College alumni. The
appointment is on a five year contract
starting on June 1st.
Mr More's most recent position
was at INSEAD, a management
training college in Paris. Previously
he was Development Officer at
Edinburgh University.
On Thursday April 20th over 100
demonstrators from N A L G O ,
including a number from Imperial
College, lobbied the meeting of the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals in support of the 1987
University Clerical and
Administrative staff pay claim. The
demonstration handed to the
committee a graph showing relative
earnings in the clerical sector.
The protesters were addressed by
the Labour Deputy Spokesman on
Health and Social Security, Frank
Dobson MP, whose constituency
covers Bloomsbury and the
University buildings.
The pay claim is for an 8% increase
or £600, whichever is greater, and
improvements in hours. It was
recommended by a Ruskin College
report commissioned jointly by
NALGO and NUPE. There is
presently a large turnover in College
secretarial staff.
ICU President Christine Taig said:
"They deserve every penny. They're
grossly underpaid and undervalued."
Fund raiser
appointed
A major reorganisation of 15 Princes
Gardens has put all Councelling,
Welfare and Accommodation Offices
on one floor. A new Welfare Advisor,
Linda Simmonds, will be starting next
month. The Welfare Centre should re-
open on Monday.
