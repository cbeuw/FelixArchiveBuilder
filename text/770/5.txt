On the eve
of the last
major Rag
event of the
year, FELIX
takes a look
at the
charities
which IC
Rag is sup-
porting this
year
Be it mud wrestling with women's
rugby, fire eating with 22 Club or
gazing at London from the Queen's
Tower, Rag Fete tomorrow promises
to be a day of fun and entertainment.
But what is it really about?
Each year Imperial College Charity
Rag raises about £11,000—£15,000
for various charities. The charities
this year are Imperial Cancer
Research, Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation
(RADAR), National Deaf Children's
Society (NDCS), British Institute for
Brain Injured Children (BIBIC) and
the Rectory Paddock School.
Rag this year is donating £3000 to
Imperial Cancer Research for the
purchase of an incubator. ICR are the
largest independent cancer research
charity and plan to give £500M to
research projects over the next ten
years.
RADAR are an information-giving
and campaigning charity for disabled
people. They run an education and
training bureau which provides home
tutors for disabled people in the
London area and correspondence
courses outside. As well as providing
custom-made devices, usually at no
cost for people with special needs,
their campaigning side monitors the
implementation of such laws as the
Tom Clarke Act which provides
special facilities for the disabled.
The National Deaf Children's
Society provides money for research
televisions) for individuals and
schools and sponsor a festival for
performing arts at the Unicorn
Theatre. NDCS are also pressing for
a change in the law over the
unsuitability of the new GCSEs for
deaf children (the NDCS Chairman,
John Butler, will be attending Rag
Fete).
BIBIC teach the parents of brain
injured children program stimulation
therapy which can improve the
children in all areas. Their main
residential centre, Knowle Hall near
Bridgewater, is being extended and
Rag is contributing a considerable
amount for this project.
The Rectory Paddock School for
Metally Handicapped Children are
buying a new minibus to replace their
old one. Most of the money is coming
from the Variety Club but Rag are
donating £3000. The new minibus
will be at Rag Fete tomorrow.
Rag Fete starts at 2.00pm
tomorrow. There is a bar extension
until 4.30pm. There will be stalls
from nearly all the societies, Bo and
Jez will be out, the Exec will be in
the stocks and the Queen's Tower will
be open. The Rag Raffle will be
drawn, possibly by Ava Gardner. In
the evening there will be a Children's
programme party in the JCR with a
1.00am extension.
So enjoy tomorrow, spend lots of
money, and remember what it's all
for.
