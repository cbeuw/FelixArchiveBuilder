Big Knockover
The Big Knockover and other stories
(Dashiell Hammett—Penguin £3.95)
With Dashiell Hammett you get more
murders per page than any other
author. In The Big Knockover, the title
story of this collection, there are forty-
six murders and at least fifty
woundings when a gang of one
hundred and fifty gunmen take over
a San Francisco bank. Hammett deals
in superlatives; his 'tec is the
archetype, whiskey-and-poker,
raincoat, dis-gusted with life and
invariably shouldering his way into
the most seedy dives. Indeed
Hammett did work for the Pinkerton
detective agency before and after the
First World War. His dust jacket reads
like a fantasy;
messenger boy, newsboy, clerk,
timekeeper, yardman, stevedore."
Who needs a degree? He died of the
effects of TB accentuated by his
imprisonment ten years previously as
a civil rights campaigner. His stories
are wacky and varied—there are ten
in this book; murders in Chinatown,
on a millionaires' island, a wild west
hick town that deals in illegal Mexican
immigrants. The backgrounds and
characters are casually sketched in
with a few accurate colours of the pen,
the stories are enthralling and you
don't feel impelled to solve them
before he does. This is a great book
and nine out of ten cats said their
editors preferred it.
FILM
Working Girls
Working Girls and Personal Services
are two films currently doing the
rounds that deal with the subject of
prostitution. On the surface they seem
different, but their cores are very
similar.
Lizzie Borden's Working Girls is a
documentary style 'day in the life'
story of a well run New York Brothel.
It is filmed almost entirely within the
claustrophobic apartment where no
'kinky stuff is allowed (or, at least,
costs more). It is seen through the eyes
of Hooker and Yale graduate Louise
(Louise Page) who talks philosophy
with clients.
Terry Jones' Personal Services tells
how Christine (Julie Walters) takes
over from her prostitute tennant when
she moves out, owing 8 weeks' rent,
and leaving a string of potential
clients. Eventually Christine opens a
brothel to cater for 'really kinky stuff;
its clients are mainly diplomats, judges
etc. The film, as well as being
consistently and hilariously funny, cuts
deep into the hypocrisy of the British
sex laws and our whole attitude to the
subject. As one of her clients said,
when he admitted to his perversion he
was coming out of a "very crowded
closet".
Both Working Girls and Personal
Services are firmly on the side of the
women, who see sex as a commodity,
in great demand, to be bought and
sold. All are in total control of their
own lives, minds and bodies and
consider themselves well above the
men to whom they sell their services,
if not the whole of the male sex.
Christine's bitternessfinallybreaks out
following her arrest; "Men can't talk
a bit of sense 'til they're despunked"
she screams" When their balls are full
their brains are empty". Louise makes
her emotional separation from the
male sex more obvious—her lover is
female.
Although both films are humourous
and (dare I say it?) entertaining, the
ultimate merrage of each is desolate,
depressing and empty, just as is the
whole subject of prostitution; it is
ignored or brushed to one side as
'somebody else's problem'.

FILM
Prick Up
Your
Ears
Prick up your Ears is a film about a
tragic love affair. Written by Alan
Bennett and based on John Lahr's
biography of Joe Orton, the film
centres on the relationship between
Orton and his homosexual lover,
Kenneth Halliwell, who was
eventually to brutally murder Orton.
The very fact that Halliwell's name is
remembered today is ironic, since it
was jealousy of Orton's fame as a
young 60's playwrite that undoubtedly
played the largest part in driving
Halliwell to kill his lover.
In recognisable Bennett style the
film cuts unchronologically between
two narratives, that of the Biographer
collecting information for his book and
that of the Biography itself, but
concentrates on the story of Orton and
his lover.
They meet in London while trying
to become actors and Halliwell, an
aspiring writer, takes the younger,
uneducated Orton under his wing. In
the early years the relationship goes
well while together they struggle to
write, and amuse themselves by
taking side swipes at authority. But
Halliwell becomes increasingly upset
both at Orton's sexual rejection of him
in favour of frequent encounters with
pick-ups, and at his increasing success
as a writer. It becomes clear that
Halliwell is the real innocent of the
two as his frustration and jealousy
bring him to the verge of insanity, just
as Orton is becoming a national
celebrity.
The film is ably directed by Stephen
Frears, following on admirably from
his success with My Beautifull
Launderette and, like that film,
presents its subject matter in a
straightforward, no nonsense way.
Orton and Halliwell are both
excellently played, Gary Oldman as
the irreverent and unsympathetic
Orton, Alfred Molina as the sad,
neurotic Halliwell. Bennett's clever
and funny script offsets the depressing
nature of the story and deals with the
seedy side of 60's homosexuality
sympathetically. All in all an enjoyable
and revealling film. Presently playing
at the Curzon, Shaftesbury Avenue
and the Screen on the Green,
Islington.
