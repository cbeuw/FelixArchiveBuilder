Dear Ed,
We feel it is our duty to warn fellow
unsuspecting students of the dangers
which lurk within Kensington
Gardens. At 8 o'clock this evening six
of us ventured out for a walk. While
'8-wheel Jack' was razzing on her
roller skates the rest of us engaged in
a highly energetic ball game!! During
the course of which, our ball (or
rather, the tennis ball Natalie found
in Linstead Bar!) was devoured by a
ravenous flower bed, into which it
was thrown by 'Clutzy Charlotte'. As
if this wasn't distressing enough, on
reaching the gate outside Kensington
Palace (with the intention of going to
MacDonalds) we found them locked.
Not wishing to forego the pleasures
of a MacDonald's milkshake we
decided to scale the heights. This,
however, is not as easy as it may
appear.
At the sight of six worried looking
females (due to the spikes at the top
of the fence) a gallant drunken
Londoner rushed over to help, leaping
over the fence to demonstrate how
easy it was. His over-enthusiastic
efforts nearly caused a serious injury
for Jackie on the top of the fence, who
was posing for the tourists, keen to
capture quaint London customs on
film. On noticing Jackie's precarious
position a handsome young man
appeared, catching her, much to the
disgust of his girlfriend! With Jackie
safely over, the others were
committed to following her. After
surveying the fence, Natalie (a life
scientist and therefore able to find an
easy way out of everything)
discovered the simplest route,
utilising the handle of the gate
(no...the gate was locked). With an
extra foothold it was now possible to
negotiate the obstacle with care (due
to the spikes). Natalie, Helen,
Charlotte and Jackie (now skateless)
then joined the other Jackie on the far
side, leaving Kate, wearing a skirt and
scared of heights, not happy about the
situation. By this time the handsome
young man had left (dragged off by
his girlfriend, who instantly
recognised Natalie's man-eating
instincts) and not even the offer, from
the drunken Londoner, of his back as
an extra foothold was enough to tempt
her over the gate. But, after a little
more encouragement, and one false
start, we were all on our way to
MacDonalds.
So you have been warned.

ULU Saved
The fate of ULU probably seems
entirely insignificant to the majority
of IC students, who consider even
their own students union an
irrelevance. Large colleges which
have good facilities, such as IC,
function perfectly adequately on a day
to day basis without the aid of the
centralised London Union. This is one
of the reasons why ULU was open to
attack when the need for drastic cuts
arose. Though the heat may be off for
the moment, there can be little doubt
that students unions will be in danger
in future when more cuts are
threatened. Unless there is a major
upset at the next general election the
government will continue to trim the
education budget for as long as they
are allowed to get away with it. As
UGC funding contracts, universities
will have to supplement their incomes
more and more with sponsorship from
industry and private research
contracts. Imperial already receives
a substantial amount of money in this
way and the administration are keen
to see this increase. More and more
emphasis is going to be on
'economically viable' research,
means-tested grants will eventually
give way to student loans, and tertiary
education will move further towards
being privately funded instead of
state-maintained. Science institutions
will no doubt do relatively well, but
students unions will be squeezed out
as government money dwindles, and,
as usual, students will suffer.
Rag Fete
Tomorrow is IC's Rag Fete—the
main Rag event of the summer and the
last chance to collect for this year's
charities. On page 5 there is a short
article about the organisations which
benefit from money raised by IC.
This is the side of Rag which really
counts—if you can take time off from
exams, for Rag events try to get out
and support this event and the people
who have spent the year organising
fund raising events for your
entertainment.
Print Unit
This is my 26th issue of FELIX and
the novelty is beginning to wear a bit
thin. More and more, I have found,
the job is concerned with running the
Print Unit rather than editing FELIX.
I do not have time to look after
personally everyone who wishes to
make use of the facilities, but I do not
like having the FELIX Office treated
as a service which exists only to meet
the needs of club publicity
requirements. I will go out of my way
to help anyone, but I do not like the
implication that people are entitled to
my attention, or, more importantly,
to the attention of volunteer staff. If
anybody is dissatisfied, Kall-Kwik is
on Old Brompton Road.
