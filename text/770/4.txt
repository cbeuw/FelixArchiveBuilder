The Good News
It appears that the University of
London Union is safe, at least for
another couple of years. The UGC
funds allocated to the Central
University over the next three years
are to be higher than originally
predicted, and rather than facing a
50% cut in income ULU is in fact
receiving a 3.6% increase, as is the UL
Careers Advisory Service. The Central
Accommodation Office and Health
Centre are to receive similar increases,
while the library and department of
Extra-Mural Studies are to receive
increases of 0.86% and 0.35%
respectively.
This is extremely good news,
especially when you consider that the
University of London as a whole
spends far less on student facilities and
amenities than the national average
(1.5% of recurrent expenditure
compared to a national average of
2.3%, according to the recently
published ULU document 'The Future
of Student Amenities in the Federal
University').
ULU extends its thanks to everyone
who helped and supported them in
their campaign against funding cuts.
Meanwhile, make the most of the
Central University facilities while you
can; although things look rosy at
present there is no doubt that ULU will
be under scrutiny again in the next
round of cuts.
More about ULU:
Three ULU posts are up for election
at the next General Union Council
meeting on June 2nd.
The posts are:
GUC Chair
Women's Officer
International Officer
The GUC Chair is responsible for the
smooth running of ULU General
Council meetings. The International
and Women's Officers are non-voting
posts on the ULU executive,
responsible for advising on all matters
relating to their respective student
groups.
All three posts are open to any full
member of Imperial College;
nominations close on Monday 18th
May at noon. If anyone's interested in
standing for one of the posts, come
and see me for more information and
a nomination form.
More Good News
At last the Imperial College Welfare
system appears to be getting into
shape. The whole service will be based
on the first floor of 15 Princes
Gardens; the Accommodation Office
at the front, dealing with all matters
relating to College and private
residences (apart from residence bills
which are paid in the Sherfield
Building); the Welfare Centre and
Welfare Advisor's Office in the middle
and the Student Counsellor's Office at
the back.
A new Welfare Advisor, Linda
Simmons, has just been appointed and
been re-decorated and leaflets on a
range of subjects are available there.
If you have urgent problems Lesley
Gillingham, the Accommodation
Officer, can probably help you in the
interim before Linda starts work.
A Request
There are plans to organise a big party
for children of students and staff of the
College, probably on June 21st. The
party will be held on the Queen's
should be starting work at the end of
May. She will complete what should
be a good, comprehensive service,
offering advice and help on a range
of matters from financial and
accommodation to work and personal
problems. This is not before time; the
welfare service has been in a state of
disarray for most of the year with too
few people trying to do too many jobs.
Linda will have a lot of re-building to
do but having met her, I'm sure she's
more than capable of it!
Meanwhile the Welfare Centre has
Lawn and will be a "mini-fair" with
various stalls, games and activities for
up to 300 kids. The party is being
organised by Clare Ash, but energetic
as she is she won't manage single-
handed! If any groups or individuals
would like to help out, or have bright
ideas for activities and stalls, let me
know within the next couple of weeks
and we can then offer some support
for this idea—which sounds like a good
one and should be a lot of fun.
That's it for now, take care.

Gay News
I'd like to start this week by thanking
all the people who screwed up their
courage and turned up at our meeting
on Wednesday. I don't think any of
them regretted it one bit, and I hope
to see them all again, hopefully with
several more new faces, next
Wednesday, same time, same place
(Green Committee Room, 12.30pm).
Some concern has been
expressed—usually behind my back-
about what such a meeting is for. Well,
to start with, we are not in the
business of organising rampant
bonking sessions. Anyone who has
thought this should start questioning
their attitudes to sexuality rather
deeply.
The purpose of this group is simple:
We aim to provide somewhere for the
gay students and staff of Imperial
College, where just for a while they
can be completely themselves without
fear of ridicule or attack—fears that for
many are very real indeed. I don't say
that these fears are always justified,
but given the atmosphere here they
are understandable.
I would also like to restate my
invitation to anyone who isn't gay or
lesbian, but still thinks they might like
to come along—you're welcome.
I'm sorry to see that there has still
been very little reaction to all this in
the FELIX letters page. I had hoped
to see an exchange of ideas and
constructive criticism, and surely some
of you must have something to say?
See you on Wednesday,
Andrew Bannister
