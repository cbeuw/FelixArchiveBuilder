How far to go with
hedgehog love
/ 7 v _ _ „ / 7 \ I F E E L w o r r i e d a b o u t my
recent emotions. You s e e ,
I've been very lonely these past few long summer
nights and have taken rather a shining to one of my
hedgehogs. I know it can be dangerous, but the way
her spines glisten under the lab spots and her little
nose twitches from side to side when I insert my nee-
dle into her is just too much for me to bear.
I know it is unethical to get too attached to one's
experiments, but I can't help myself. Sometimes we
go for walks by the road side, or see who can cross
slowest. I experience this exhilarating sense of pres-
sure every time a car drives past. It's just something
else! We haven't spoken about sex yet, but I can tell
that it's on Harriet's mind. I am not very experienced
and was wondering if you could advise me on how to
proceed.

• DAVINA SAYS: Well, why not? It'll certainly be a prickly poke!
You could try the old man's tummy tickler (otherwise known as
no. 88 in the Kama Sutra) - it's always been a pleasant eye opener
for me. Do watch out when you roll over though!!!

because of all the power I thought it'd give me with
those nubile young scholar-esses. Instead I have
tutorials with dysfunctional square-eyed geeks. How
am I ever going to release my sexual emotions?
• OAVINASAYS: Those nubile
young scholar-esses, as you :S

R E A D I N G y o u r a d v i c e
last week, I decided to
try my luck with the
F r i d a y FELIX l o n e l y -
hearts column. I hit jack-
pot s t r a i g h t a w a y , as
someone with wide inter-
ests and a PhD asked me
for a c h i c k e n curry in
L i n s t e a d . T r a g i c a l l y ,
w h e n I a r r i v e d I just
c o u l d n ' t pick out my
poulet "dish" from all the
" m i d d l i n g - h e i g h t , n o n -
descript, rather desper-
ate-looking" cocks. So, if
y o u ' r e r e a d i n g this,
G r a h a m , get d o w n to
Basics and show me your
swipe card!
Gertie
• DAVINA SAYS: Raise your
sights! Just because he has a
PhD and "wide interests" does-
n't mean you should endure
Linstead's fodder. Hit the high
life! Surely if you meet at the
Ritz there will be NO confu-
sion!
I'VE become passionately
involved with my a e r o -
nautics tutor. It's really
convenient, as she lets
me off all the c o u r s e -
work. Trouble is, I've got
an embarrassing fetish I
haven't r e v e a l e d . Ever
since I saw M a r i l y n
Monroe with her skirt bil-
lowing around her waist
I've w a n t e d to do the
same in our wind tunnel,
with my tutor in the
n u d e , r e c o r d i n g it on
v i d e o . How c a n I p e r -
suade her?
Andrew
• DAVINA SAYS: I'm not sure
that if she catches wind of your
ideas she'll be around for the
final take. My advice is to keep
your gusty goings-on F I R M L Y
UNDER WRAPS!
I RECENTLY p a s s e d my
Link's initiation and was
hence looking forward to
greater success with the
babes. Karl told me that
d r i n k i n g a n d r u n n i n g
KELLY'S CACTUS-LOVE BREAKUP - BAV mWTV TWO
LAST term I met a true
s t u n n a in the JCR.
Unfortunately he left me
panting for more, as he
m o v e d on to my best
friend. She has suggest-
ed we share him, but I
don't think so! There are
lots m o r e g o r g e o u s
hunks out there, and she
should bloody well go off
and get her own!

• DAVINA SAYS: What's your
problem, girlie? Eyesight?
around Beit Quad naked
m a k e s you irresistible.
Bizarrely, every chick I
meet now kicks me in the
balls and tells me to " G o
get a l i f e " . What does
this mean?
Tim
• DAVINA SAYS: Who can say?
Chicks should be so lucky, eh?

CONTINUES TOMORROW UNFORTUNATELY
R E C E N T L Y on a Geology
field trip we were having a
right old laff down the pub
after a good days' digging
when a chubby lad waddled
over. I have to admit I'd had
a few, and I felt sorry for the
poor bloke. So, to cut a very
short story short, I gave him a
good time in the ladies.
Unfortunately he's been play-
ing poodle ever since. I can't
shake him off!!!! What am I
to do?
Kate
• DAVINA SAYS: In these kind of
situations dear, you have to be
cruel to be kind. Swallow your
pride and jump on the next
bloke you see, hopefully while
poodle is watching. This should
put him off. Do try and pick a
better one this time, though.
HELP! There's a man in
my lab who thinks I'm a
hedgehog! He keeps on
insisting I go for walks
with him down country
lanes a n d jump in front
of oncoming cars! I don't
know what to do. I think
he m i g h t be p l a n n i n g
s o m e a d v a n c e s on m e
and I really couldn't bear
any more violence ... and
oh those needles...
Harriet H. Hog
• DAVINA SAYS: I have a sneak-
ing feeling you might be
cohorting with a highly suspect
individual! M y advice is stay
away girl! Y o u don't know
WHAT he might think of doing
next.
