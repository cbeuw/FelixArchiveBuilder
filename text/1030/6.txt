Record Breakers... Imperial Apathy... Calling all Clubs and Societies
Felix 'Breaks'
Record
Dear Felix,
After writing an article entitled
"Student breaks 2 UK records",
only to have Felix lose it, we were
pleased to learn that it would
eventually be printed in the issue
on Friday 19th May. We were
however extremely disappointed to
find the article, which we consid-
ered extremely newsworthy, to be
tucked away in the middle of Felix.
I draw your attention to an item
which appeared on the front page
of the issue of 5th May. This is a
story about a girl who devised a
recycling scheme for cans at
Imperial. I am amazed that a story
such as this is deemed newsworthy
enough to go on the front page
but that a student who breaks 2
UK records while flying an Imperial
College glider is not considered
important. I would have thought
that a student breaking 2 UK
records was news enough in itself.
How many other students can
claim this feat? That the records
were broken in an Imperial
College glider recently purchased
for the club surely only adds
weight to the argument.

Being a glider pilot myself, I can
really appreciate the feat that Pete
Masson has achieved. Getting the
right conditions is a rare opportuni-
ty and in using them to such an
end, I can only take my hat off to
Pete.
I am, however, also disappoint-
ed that Pete's record did not recieve
more acclaim and can only apolo-
gise for this mis-appreciation. It is
also worth considering the impact a
gliding record will have on Joe
average. "Records are broken all
the time why should gliding be so
special?" Well, true I suppose. The
answer is in finding the balance.
Unfortunately, in your case, the bal-
ance fell towards the wrong end!
Preponderance
of Grey-
Scientists
Dear Felix,
I have been doing my best to sup-
press my outrage for some time
but I can no longer hold these
opinions to myself. What is hap-
pening to this place - a university -
a London, England university? It
should be a balstillion of free
thought, uninhibited expression, a
place where the worlds future
leaders form their values and
make the choice of which path
they will take and which principles
they will embrace! Not hanging
around in dingy common rooms
reading the Daily Mail, drinking
watery hot chocolate and dis-
cussing the merits of various bank
accounts!
What's happening to this place?
Last week's pathetic election
turnout is symptomatic of the
dreadful dull greyness of our stu-
dents' politics. Apathy is too good
a word! Implying a deliberate gen-
eral protest by non conformity, an
honourable idleness. This is noth-
ing but brain death. A collection of
over seven thousand 18-24 year
olds and Felix struggles to fill its
pages with even the most pious of
offerings. You are a member of the
group traditionally considered the
most politically active and radical
of the country. You are expected to
fill an essential role in society - to
challenge, to question and to
make opinions be heard. This is
the time when your beliefs and
principles are gained and built
upon to try however vainly to
relieve the man on the street from
the power hungry and to do your
lot to improve the world. And judg-
ing by the current feeling it looks
as if we're destined to plunge fur-
ther into control, regime, destruc-
tion, unhappiness and ugliness.
There. I just needed to get that
off my chest.

It sounds like the bottle has burst on
yet another victim of the Imperial
apathy spell. It only takes a while to
realise that there's more to life than
Imperial. If you don't like Imperial
then there's London, if you don't
like London then what are you
doing here?
I do agree, however, with your
point about students not taking
College politics seriously. Is this a
problem with the students or a
problem with the system? I would
suggest the latter. Maybe the times
of student politics are changing and
students no longer feel the need to
press their political views. Students
poor turnout at meetings and elec-
tions is evidence to suggest this. My
opinion is that you can't change the
students but you can change the

Handbook
Blues
Dear Felix,
Thank you to everyone who sent
me their club and society informa-
tion for the iCU Handbook. Those
who included lots of information
can expect to be inundated with
new members as new first years
drool at their potential for events...
To those of you who forgot impor-
tant information like email address
of chairbeing, regular meeting
place and time etc, tough, as all
entries are going in as I have
received them, and you will be for-
ever tormented by the words "I
would have joined, but I didn't
know how to contact them...".
You all have until the Union
Office open on Tuesday 30th May
to get extra information to me. This
includes the 60+ clubs who didn't
send me anything in the first place.
I will clear my pigeonhole some-
time on that Tuesday... anything
received afterwards will not be
accepted. You have been warned!
From,
Helen-Louise Windsor

because they cheered me up)

Even More Revision Killers
Keys: Music, Dancing, Cocktails, Carnival
To avoid Felix's editing scissors,
I'll be unusually brief and to the
point this week. So hang on to
your bits for a whistle stop tour of
pleasure...
Friday - Shaft

Cocktail Night. 5pm - 11pm.
Friday, 5 June - Pop Tarts
And now for something at least a
little bit different. I C U puts it's
toe cautiously into the waters of
'Indie-dom' (for want of a better
word), and has a break from too
many 'Repetitive Beats'. So, if you
t h i n k we've been too Dance-
Centric in the past, and you want
to hear guitars and stomp around
a bit, then prepare yourself for
'Pop Tarts' - from Retro-Indie to
90's pop for tonight at least, the
world is your oyster!

Friday, 9 June - Live Music
Live dance music from our own
