Union Moves to Halt Harassment
BY T E D W S H I R M A N
The increasing number of
harassment cases being brought
to the attention of Imperial
College Union (ICU) has led to
the drawing up of an official
Union policy on the matter. With
the previous U n i o n sexual
harassment policy due to expire
this June, it was decided that
I C U needed a comprehensive
strategy.
The new paper describes the
procedure which students can
follow if they feel intimidated, by
either other students or staff
members. It sets out examples of
behaviour w h i c h could be
deemed offensive. While encom-
passing both racial and sexual
abuse, the policy suggests that
'public or persistent unwarranted
criticism of performance' is also a
form of harassment which needs
to be addressed.
The new document was
drawn up by a number of Union
officials with the cooperation of
College, who w i l l shortly be
publishing their own policy. The
I C U harassment regulations are
clearly only enforceable in Union
controlled areas, but students are
expected to adhere to it at all
times.
L u c y Chothia, I C U
President, has described the
exercise as an attempt at
'formalising' the idea that
harassment is offensive and that
students must not misbehave in
this way.
Ms Chothia suggested that
students could be brought before
College disciplinaries i f they
offend outside Union premises. It
is anticipated that the policy will
be advertised around College,
possibly with concise forms
being posted i n the U n i o n
building.
T h e policy was formally
approved by the I C U Council
meeting last Tuesday, where the
paper was only briefly considered
before being passed. The single
amendment was by Charlie Bell,
Royal College of Science Union
President, who wished to include
mention of the fact that the
CCU's have welfare officers.
M s Chothia admitted that
she was surprised that no other
alterations were proposed, adding
that she was somewhat sorry
there was no further con-
sideration of the policy.
Annual Meeting
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Last Friday's Imperial College
Union Annual General Meeting
passed off i n a record twenty
minutes with the now standard
small turnout.
Although the attendance of
about sixty students was less than
one third of that officially
required, nobody formally
complained that the meeting was
inquorate and so the decisions
will still be valid.
Items on the agenda
included the election of next
years' U n i o n officers and the
approval of the present officers'
annual reports. The seven
candidates who stood unopposed
for officer positions were ratified
without complaint, with current
Royal School of Mines President
V i n o d Fernandez gaining the
position of Council Chairman.
The new position of Equal
Opportunities Officer was filled
at the Union Council meeting on
Tuesday, but there are still no
takers for the job of Women's
Officer.
The reports from the current
batch of U n i o n officials were
passed, and the meeting closed.
As the assembled crowd were
leaving the room the chairman
was reminded that next years'
sabbatical election results had to
be approved at the meeting. This
was achieved without objection.
(Leagues continuesfrom page one)
adding "we are very strongly
enthused by it."
This year's simplified league
is based on assessment of eleven
different criteria, including the
quality of university teaching,
student facilities and
employment prospects. T h e
analysis of the top-rated
universities gives results that
show no dramatic changes from
last year.
Overall, the league shows
that the continuing expansion of
higher education is leading to a
marked pressure on the lower and
middle ranked establishments. In
particular, the availability of
student accommodation and good
staff/student ratios are becoming
increasingly difficult to achieve.
Student housing continues to
be one of Imperial's weaknesses,
with rooms available for only
40% of undergraduates. IC comes
well down the league, although it
does fare better than any other
central London college.
New procedures to grade the
quality of university teaching,
from the H i g h e r Education
F u n d i n g C o u n c i l for England
( H E F C E ) , form the basis of the
academic component of the
Times league. A l t h o u g h the
H E F C E analysis is yet to be
completed, Imperial has come out
strongly so far.
M o r e w o r r y i n g is the
employment prospects for
graduates: according to the
league tables only 46% of
Imperial's students had found
permanent jobs a year after they
had left college, though a further
35% had taken up positions i n
research.

Those of you who are reading
this newspaper i n the logical
numerical order - I suggest you
keep going and return here later.
Do not collect Â£200.
If you're Chinese, or else you
previously skipped ahead then
what can I say? We learnt a lot
putting together our ' F r i d a y
Felix'. Our principal lesson is
that tabloids are more fun!
A common complaint
amongst F F staff was that what
seemed easy when read in The
Mirror (and the office has been
strewn with tabloids this week) is
actually very difficult to pull off.
(Fnawr, fnawr. Ahem)
For instance, everyone
thinks they can write the page
three blurbs, "bouncy Brenda,
21, etc". But not everyone is
called Brenda (and people always
say bouncy). Brenda never
bounces, read the Sun and see.
You're w o r k i n g with around
three unchanging physical
attributes everyday. It's harder
then it looks. (Fnawr fnawr..)
Somebody from the real
media told me earlier this week
that you can always tell whether
a journalist is from the tabloids
or the qualities by their clothes.
Scruffy individuals are broad-
sheet chatterers whilst imma-
culate suited hawks are almost
always from the gutter.
Hmmm. I need a shave.
