Red Faces
BY T H E NEWS T E A M
F E L I X has learnt that a new
Passive Infra-Red (IR) security
system is causing more than a
few problems for the Department
of Computing. Following a spate
of high profile thefts ( F E L I X
1020-1028) the department chose
an IR system to cover their 'high
risk' areas. All of Level 4's rooms
have been fitted with a system
which can be manually activated
when staff leave their offices. The
problem seems to be that staff
return while the system is still
activated. Sources i n security
have revealed that the alarms
were triggered seven times
during a single evening last
week.
D r Jeff Magee, Assistant
Director of the C o m p u t i n g
Department, discounted sugges-
tions that the system was run-
ning into difficulties. W h i l e
admitting that there had been
two or three false alarms, he
insisted that the system is now
fully debugged and that he is
'fairly happy' with it. D r Magee
declined, for reasons of security,
to specify which other parts of
the department, in addition to
Level 4, are covered by the IR
system.
Locked Away
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Two men were jailed last week
for crimes committed at
Imperial. C y r i l D ' S o u z a was
given a five year jail sentence for
the theft of £600,000 during his
career as a St Mary's hospital
cashier. Michael Noble escaped
more lightly, being put away for
60 days having caught burgling
the college in February.
M r D'Souza was arrested in
February after 12 years of em-
bezzlement, which apparently fed
his gambling habit ( F E L I X
1006). O n admitting a theft
amounting to £652,840.58 he was
quoted as saying, "I suppose you
could say I was gambling crazy."
The massive fraud was only
uncovered when St Mary's
completed an internal financial
audit and found the irregul-
arities. D'Souza managed to
spend the majority of the
embezzled funds, leaving college
looking to their employee
insurance to make up the lost
money.
M r . Noble, who was
sentenced at Horseferry Road
magistrates court last Friday, has
a record of offenses for burglary
and theft. He is reported to have
cased Imperial College twice to
establish what he could steal
before actually being spotted
acting suspiciously by a security
guard.

dealt with by the police in recent
years. But, stressing the 'good
liaison' IC security have with the
local constabulary, M r Reynolds
insisted that students found with
'traffickable amounts' would 'go
straight to the police'.
Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security, echoed M r Reynold's
comments, insisting that he was
primarily concerned with the
welfare of the students involved.
He worried that students who
left Imperial with a c r i m i n a l
record might find it difficult to
get jobs. He acknowledged that
use of cannabis was no more
harmful then the excessive use of
alcohol often seen on campus,
F E L I X
but expressed his fear that entry
into 'the whole drugs subculture'
was damaging and dangerous.
A n ex-Southside resident
who was caught smoking can-
nabis last year said that the res-
ponse to the problem was un-
realistic. "Revision of IC policies
isn't going to change anything,"
he insisted. "As soon as you get
rid of the small time dealers,
they'll be replaced, and the
epidemic will go on." According
to the student, Imperial's tense
atmosphere partly explains the
widespread use of cannabis. He
said that his former l/8th ounce
daily habit 'was escapism in the
sense that academic IC life is so
full of pressures.'
"She's Got Seoul!" writes Rachel Walters. Lucy Chothia, Imperial College
Union President, jetted off to South Korea yesterday to attend the 1995
World Youth Leaders' Conference. She has taken a pictorial history of IC, as
well as an Imperial lager glass and key rings, to add to a collection ofstudent
memorabilia that is being assembled for the event's posterity. The massi
gathering, to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, will see 190
universities from 57 countries represented. The United Kingdom delegati
has 11 student leaders from around the country, although Gemma William
University of London Union President declined her invitation in favour ofth
National Union of Students conference this weekend.
Mary's Turnout
BY T H E NEWS T E A M
St Mary's Hospital Medical
School Students' Union turned
out in force this week to elect
their team of Union represen-
tatives. In contrast to the
Constituent College U n i o n s
based in South Kensington, there
were a number of contested
posts, with three students vying
for the job of Mary's President.
With over three hundred votes
cast, Sarah Edwards easily over-
whelmed her two opponents to
decisively become next year's
President, taking exactly 200
ballots.
The other position which
deals directly with Imperial
College Union, Vice-President
(External Affairs), saw a closer
race. Wayne Miles was still
clearly ahead of Davina Hansen
though - 206 votes to 108. The
second Vice-Presidential contest,
this time for Internal Affairs, was
even tighter with Samantha
Antony managing to defeat Re-
Open Nominations ( R O N ) by
just under 50 votes - 182 to 134.
Information and Educ-
ational Representative posts were
filled by Katie Armstrong and
Louise Moran respectively. The
Social Secretary and her
Assistant are Suzie Barnes and
Ptash Patel, and Wendy King is
next year's senior bar manager.
Four posts are unfilled, including
the important job of Treasurer,
with by-elections expected to be
held in a month's time.
Commenting on the results
Claire Moloney, the current
Mary's President, expressed her
hope that those elected would
collaborate with Imperial College
U n i o n officials. "I have every
confidence in the new Exec-
utive," she said, adding,
"Hopefully they'll work well with
their counterparts on the South
Kensington site."
