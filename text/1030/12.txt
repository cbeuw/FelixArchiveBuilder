Just hitch-hike to Dover, then follow a ferry by
swimming and you're there. Buy a boiled sweet
with the 5p and eat it for energy.
YOU'RE SACKED

FELIX SUPREMO 'stabbed in
back' by lifelong trusted pals
BY CHE CUEVERA
(our Man In Charge)
Felix Editor Owain Benn-
allack, 22, has been ousted
from his position as an
overpaid media mogul.
The revolution came last
Tuesday, as Bennallack settled
down to fabricate another issue
of fairy-tale stories about the
NUS and the Gliding Club.
"He used make up all these
lies on Tuesday and then take
the rest of the week off to play,
golf," said a jubilant Jon
Jordan, a key man in the
takeover. "We knew that the
people of IC deserved better
then his porkies. I've been
lying for years and I can do it a
lot better then him."
Kicking
Not everyone is pleased
with the good kicking this
overpraised egotist has
received. Sir Ronald Mac-
Donald, 63, said: "The best
thing about Bennallack was
that he came cheap. A tenner
and a bottle of whiskey and he
was anyone's. I can't imagine
how we're going to explain
away our radical plan to phase
out students and phase in
German tourists now he's gone."
Tarts
Plans for the new look
F E L I X include loads of top
totty, tickets to Calais and
competitions to win crates of
beer. "We looked at what lC
students suffered compared to
the rest of the world and we
knew we could do better," said
Jon Jordan jubilantly. "IC men
like tarts not arts!"
Broken
It is not known what
Bennallack will do next. It is
thought he may attempt to
regain control of his news-
paper. To prevent this, Friday
Felix staff have employed a
huge geezer named Kev, 19, to
beat the living daylights out of
anyone who comes near.
Bennallack's mother, Mrs
Bennallack, hit out at reports
that her son was finished. "It'll
take more than Summer Bingo,
Photo Casebooks and turnips
to get rid of my son!" She went
on to say that the first thing he
had done after being fired was
to return home to his mother.
"And if anyone does find out
how to get rid of him, will they
please give me a ring."
Stihversive Pervert
The first challenge for the
Friday Felix will be to steal the
old F E L I X ' s readership. Early
plans to flog it in the I C U
bookstore floundered when it
was found that F E L I X ' s loyal
reader has moved to Silwood
to finish his Biology project.
In the light of this, it has
been decided to attempt to gain
a new audience by disguising
the publication within an issue
of the old F E L I X . "No-one is
around in the summer term so
no-one's going to notice
anyway", said Jordan.
FELIX is 47.

Q U E E N S T O W E R O N M O O N
BY PATRICK MOORE
There was uproar in
astronomy circles last night
when it was revealed that a
famous Imperial College
landmark, the Queen's
Tower, was on the moon.
Telescopes in Swansea
were the first to pick out the
anomaly. "We were looking
for Hitler's World War Two
bomber on the moon's
surface," said Ivan Evans, 45,
"when we noticed a huge
structure. It looked like an
ancient civilisation. But then a
wheelchair bound ex-Imperial
researcher, Steve Hawkswing,
recognised the tower he'd
jumped off as a student."
A radical feminist group,
the 1C Bearded Babes, has
claimed responsibility for the
illicit transfer. "We did it last
night when no-one was
looking," said leader, Miss
Lucy Look-here. "For too long
this phallic symbol has
hampered our progress at IC."
The moon is eighty million
years old.
N U S B I D T O
J O I N I C U
BY H. ACKMAN and S. POD,
(Our boredroom writers)
Imperial College Union
(ICU) has been approached
by top members of the
National Union of Students
(NUS) with a view to them
joining the Imperial body.
The N U S split from I C U
seventeen years ago and is the
only major group of students
who've not joined. The RCS,
C i t y & G u i l d s , R S M and
approximately twenty-six
medical institutions all belong
to the South Kensington
operation. But now the NUS is
being woed by the promise of
cheap beer and extra cash.
"And we wanna be
allowed to get our kit off in
crowded bars too," said
Jimbo, N U S President. "Why
should we suffer political
correctness when Imperial
students live it up vomiting
and playing macho sports?"
It is not clear how I C U
would absorb the extra four
hundred thousand students
that the N U S would bring.
Contingency plans include
extending Da Vinci's out into
the quad and hiring extra
stewards on Friday nights.
Mr Marc Horny-Monster,
I C U Events Manager, 41,
said: "It will be difficult to
cater for all those students but
not impossible. At least we
will be able to justify building
a bigger venue, which will
allow us to stage several Marc
Almond concerts a year".
The Rector, 108, said it
was far too silly to comment.
