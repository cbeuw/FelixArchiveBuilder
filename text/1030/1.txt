Smokers Smoked Out
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Following a spate of successful
raids on Imperial College Halls
of Residence, security are to over-
haul College's anti-drugs policy.
Fifteen students have been
caught smoking cannabis in the
past week alone.
Undergraduates were dis-
covered using marijuana in three
separate incidents at halls in both
Southside and Evelyn Gardens.
They are now being dealt with by
internal College disciplinary
procedures. The unprecedented
outbreak has led senior aca-
demics and college tutors to call
for a clampdown on the problem.
At present unofficial college
protocol means that students
found in possession of small
amounts of cannabis are dealt
with internally. Increased
pressure to clean up Imperial
could lead to students, guilty of
only minor offenses, being taken
to the police.
K e i t h Reynolds, Head of
Security, is now in discussion
with both senior college tutors
and the Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, in an attempt to define
Imperial's policy more clearly.
They plan to produce a statement
on the issue with the aim of
raising student awareness. Speak-
ing to F E L I X , M r Reynolds
stressed the wider issues at stake,
in particular how college should
best handle i n d i v i d u a l cases.
Many of the students caught in
the past week had said that their
main fear was of their parents
finding out, and M r Reynold's
questioned whether college had
any right to 'run and tell
M u m m y that their 18 year-old
was caught.'
M r Reynolds expressed
concern over the scale of
marijuana use in college. "If we
threw everyone we found smok-
ing cannabis to the wolves, we
would have no one left," he
joked. The extent of usage in
halls of residence has become
more apparent w i t h the
installation of the new fire alarm
system. Whilst the new detectors
will not react to cigarette use,
they are triggered by the ionising
smoke of cannabis. Speculating
that 80% of IC students use soft
drugs at some stage of their
undergraduate careers, M r
Reynolds emphasised that "they
are still committing a criminal
offense."

drug use at Imperial has been

Leagues
Ahead
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Imperial College has held onto
t h i r d place i n The Times
University league. The national
ranking of Higher Education
institutions saw Imperial beaten
only by Oxford and Cambridge.
The College's performance
is rather more variable where
i n d i v i d u a l departments are
considered: whilst Civil Engin-
eering was rated first, and
Chemistry came third, geology
did not even make the top ten.
Professor W o r t h i n g t o n ,
Head of Geology, expressed dis-
belief at his department's ran-
king. W i t h a recent teaching
assessment, which graded the
department as excellent, not
taken into account Prof
Worthington suggested that the
table was drawn up on non-
existent information. He was also
unhappy at the coverage league
tables are given saying: "What's
unfortunate is that they seem to
get a lot of publicity."
The D i r e c t o r of Under-
graduate Studies in Chemistry,
Dr Lloyd-Smith, had different
feelings about the tables. "We are
absolutely t h r i l l e d at the
department's status", he said.
Whilst insisting that Chemistry
should not become complacent
Dr Lloyd-Smith pointed to the
recent change to a four year
course and very low failure rates
to explain his department's joint
t h i r d place. He said he was
grateful of the good publicity
that the league tables give,
