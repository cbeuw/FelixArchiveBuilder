Where do old rockers go to die? Well if the wildhearts are a
reasonable example, it's a grave marked NY. Vik plots their
departure as on an inbound flight, bush arrive. Mark camps
out with astralasia and fan questions a state of grace.,.
At least he's certainly not some petty minded reductionist.
Dave Cohen, when asked for his favourite bit of London,
refused the question. 'I love it all' was his embracing reply.
Fiona brings a call to arms - all hands to club side while the
going's cheap. She checks out what's hot and what's rot.
Magpie enters the regressive experience of Disney and wakes
up screaming. The film that put him there; angels.
This week rotation takes a shallow dive as we enter the
realm of that underwater purveyor of music, catfish.

I have to admit that I've never really
had much time for the wildhearts.
Having seen them three times,
they've always come across as a
merely more scuzzy version of the
now sadly defunct Senseless Things
and yet they seemed to rake in all
the plaudits. The irony of it is that
they've now got ex-Things singer,
Mark Keds, playing with them.
Bitterness aside, their second
Ip, the cunningly and subtly titled
p.h.u.g., still doesn't manage to rub
me up the right way. It's another
raucous melange of punk and
drunk, quirky pop metal, veering
from the off-beat but curiously
memorable ('v-day'), through
testosterone-fuelled anthems like
'just in lust' to epic guitar workouts
like 'caprice'. All above average
stuff but it left me feeling more
apathetic than empathetic.
Nevertheless, as the newly
inaugurated Master of the Obvious
Statement I have to say that if
you're a Wildhearts' fan, you'll
probably love it. (6)
From the Amersham Arms to
the apex of America - not exactly
what you'd call an orthodox route
to success. And yet, that's what
Shepherds Bush band, erm, bush
have done with US sales of their
debut album, sixteen stone,
standing at 800,000 and counting.
So do the first British band since Def
Leppard to make it big over there
before coming back over here,
stand up under scrutiny?
In my book, yes. Okay, so
there's no denying that they sound
like Nirvana and Soundgarden in
equal measure, and cheekbone-
pin-up Gavin Rossdale could not
have sounded more like Kurt
Cobain (rip) if he'd had a voice
transplant. But, hey. Oasis can get
away with sounding like Status
Quo, so who am I to complain?
Recent single, 'everything zen',
is a great song in its own right and
the surprise is that the great songs
keep on coming. 'Little things' is a
case in point and the likes of
'glycerine', with its orchestral
accompaniment, show that they can
come over all atmospheric in a
convincingly uncontrived manner
too.
A truly accomplished debut
then. They may have started like
Def Leppard but let's hope that they
don't end up like them. (8)
Another album from,
astralasia, the techno offshoot of
old time festival favourites, the
Magic Mushroom Band. Repetitive
beats, some far eastern sounds and
floaty female vocals all mix together
on the album, axis mundi.
These days though there are so
many bands making this type of
music that you really have to excel
to stand out from the crowd. Just
occasionally I found myself getting
bored with this one, but there are
also some fine moments which
more than compensate. Astralasia
need to progress if they're ever
going to sell a million but they
sound like they're enjoying
themselves and probably don't
care. (6)
There's a surreal intro to most
of state of g r a c e ' s songs, as
witnessed on their new album,
/amboreepop, which grabs your
attention. Things start to go
downhill when the vocals kick in
though, and it rapidly wipes away
any initial impressions you had.
It's a shame because their music is
good, sounds fresh and leaves you
craving for more stuff like the
closing part of 'bitter sun'. But the
album left me disappointed because
they seem to be capable of better
tracks. Too bad. (5) 0

"Choose your favourite piece of
London" they told me. Bah!
Humbug! And what? Tear this
marvellous city apart and offer up
the components as microcosms of
its true glory? Sabre-toothed
sacrilege! The very act of such
favouritism dismisses the essence
of a city which prides itself on
being such a cultural imbroglio. To
be precise: I can't!
From the tip of Canary Wharf
to the sleazy bowels of Soho, up to
the trendy-treadmill of Camden
Town and over the ugliness of
Oxford Street to Notting Hill with
its myriad exchanges. Down to the
river, home to many amateur
thespians, and then onward to the
plush greenery of Kew gardens I,
for one, won't choose! Each spot
holds some devilish charm, or
some melancholy memory (yet to
be had?). I mean, when you can
jump in a car (if you are lucky
enough to live with well-off flat
mates) at 2:00am and bomb
across to Brick Lone's legendary
Bagel Bake for a late night snack
and find the restaurant next door
still alive in true Eastend style; or
nose around Portobello market on
a Saturday afternoon, picking your
way through the funky clothes
stalls, cool cafes (perchance to
hang-out with Nick Cave?) and
outlandish buskers, why say 'THIS
is my London?' Madame Jo Jo's is
just waiting to invite you in for a
night to remember and a wander
around China Town, with a bit of
imagination, could turn into a
sordid affair worthy of a Miller
novel. No, I'm not being flippant,
and I'm trying not to sound like an
A-Z guide either. My point is that I
can't do without any of it. Which
by extension implies that I can't
favour any over another, lest it
overrun my cherished diversity.
So I take pride in being a
citizen of this metropolis and, as
my mood dictates, I choose an
appropriate place for my musings.
Confining yourself to some part or
other is hopelessly romantic, and
quite frankly down-right foolish.
So there. I'm greedy. I want it all. I
can't and I won't, choose. Why
should I? London simply, and
quite obviously, wouldn't be
London otherwise. Ask me which
city in England I'd choose and
that's different. Well, the answer
would still be the same. 0
