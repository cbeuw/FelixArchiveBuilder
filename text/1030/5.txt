MORTAL KOMEBACK?
E N I A C was a monster. The first digital computer, it filled a room and yet had less
computational power than a modern pocket calculator. But this was 1943, and a
machine to compute artillery trajectories was higher on the agenda than a tennis
game you could play from your armchair.
Computers have come a long way since the days of vacuum tubes and copper
wire: from the exclusive realms of big businesses and government agencies, computers have
entered the homes of ordinary people.
As the power and availability of silicon chips increases exponentially, the brains of
computers and games consoles have become
capable of more and more profound thoughts.
How is the software — without w h i c h a
computer thinks nothing — keeping up?
In this week's S-files, we explore the
phenomenon that is computer games. 40% of
American households and 30% of B r i t i s h
households include a computer games system
on their home insurance. Games accounted
for over 15 b i l l i o n pounds of world-wide
revenue i n 1994. T h e huge success of
Computer games has been the driving force Computer games have come a long way in 20 years — haven't they?
behind this spread of computer hardware. A b o v e : P o n a

Below, track the evolution of games from
Pong to the present. Machines are over 500
times faster now: are the games any different?
And on the right, we look to the future
and examine what the most recent trends say
about the games to come. W h a t w o u l d
E N I A C , with its miles of leaky plumbing,
have thought of the Mario Brothers?

\ If the last twenty years is
anything to go by, the future
\ promises only cosmetic
advances in computer games.
There will be more and more
\ realistic graphics as processors
; and massive data storage (e.g. CD-ROM) fall I
| in price and rise in power.
The current hot ticket is the so-called j
j interactive movie which is little more than a
d r e s s e d - u p a d v e n t u r e g a m e ( a l r e a d y !
I perfected in 1990). The ability to store such!
jlarge a m o u n t s of data has given rise to
[ g r a p h i c a l l y s t u n n i n g b u t g e n e r a l l y :
iuninvolving computer g a m e s such as 7th

{technology. Titles such as D o o m , SimCityl
I 2000 and Magic Carpet are prime examples
I of how to do it right. !
Unless a greater emphasis is placed on \
j originality by software houses, the public will \
j continue to be plagued by hordes of look-:
i alike products. Originality is difficult but j
I necessary because in the long run, formulaic
: creations only serve to disillusion existing :
j game players and win no new converts,
j The true spirit of software is innovation \
i and a bright and exciting future awaits all
