L A R G E , A N X I O U S C R O W D S gathered today in Central
Tokyo following the worst British Music invasion in living
memory. "It was absolute hell," one passerby explained to our on
the spot PECULIAR news-team. "We were expecting it to be bad,
perhaps another outbreak of Blur or even Oasis, but it was far more
terrible than that." Scared Japanese teenagers, 13 to 19, huddled
together in groups and relived their most terrifying moment, when
top British pop superstars, Shampoo, climbed onto the stage and
started to sing. "I thought that my heart was going to stop and my
ears were going to explode," one frightened youth confessed to me
later. "I really thought that I was going to die."
Later on that day the official explanation emerged from a top
Japanese Anti-Music aide. The ashen faced supremo read a terse
statement which said: "At midday Tokyo time there was a noxious
outbreak of British popular music. This outbreak was halted by the
speedy intervention of the Japanese Self Defence Orchestra which
restored calm with some rousing traditional marches."
MYSTERIOUS
As PECULIAR can exclusively reveal, this is not the first time the
plucky Japanese capital has experienced such a racket. Sources told
us that the problem started in the sixties with a mysterious cult group
called Be-Atl Es. "They had long
hair and people worshiped them,"
said a ex-member who feared to
be named. Ringer Star, 98, went
on, "People kissed them, they
thought they were fab."
Be-Atl E's creepy head guru,
Lindand Paul, refused to com-
ment. Paul, 64 (and we don't
need you), is said to be a
vegetarian who eats his toe-nails.

SEXY HEART THROBS
Take That got out of bed
today, PECULIAR can
officially reveal. After a
good eight and a half
hours kip in their luxury
penthouse pads, the
boys climbed out of their
separate beds and then
had a good, clean cut,
drug free breakfast.

BENDERS
WHEN Bristol youngsters, Supergrass decided to go
out on the town, the only celeb friend they invited to go
with them was yours (un)truely, as I like to call myself.
"You're a real mate," chorused the young stars. "We
don't know what we've have done without your support
in the fabulous Friday Felix."
BIG M A T E S
After playing to an audience full of screaming fans,
the lads decided to have real night on the tiles. "But you
have to come too," they demanded.
Rock Star teenagers Supergrass, quaffed back
gallons of sparkling champers as they cruised from
exclusive venues to expensive clubs. "We hope you can
keep up with us," joked the young whipper-snappers, as
they downed pints of strong continental beer and spirits.
The evening nearly ended when the top pop combo
realised that they'd run out of money. "Now we're
really glad you're with us," they laughed.
