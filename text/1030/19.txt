THE QUEEN'S LAWN is to be converted into an Olympic-size swimming pool,
it was revealed today in a leaked document from the Estates Division. In the
document, it is proposed that the Queen's Lawn be dug up and moved to the
roof of the new Basic Medical Sciences building. The Queen's Tower would
then be put to use as changing rooms, a water slide and diving boards.
"What a great idea," gushed Sarah Snow-White, president-in-waiting, "This
should have been done a long time ago."
Some authority figures have been quick to comment. "What a load of lies,"
said Ian Ciadwalls, Director of Estates. "It's completely made up!" he claimed.
But others have expressed their desire for such a project - "It's the next step in
improving sporting facilities at Imperial," a source 'close to' the Rector said. I

FAT BOY
QUIZ FOR MANSELL
E X C L U S I V E
By ZOOM ZOOM MCCILL
FAILING Formula 1 maestro Nigel
Mansell is facing a surprise inquiry by
International Race Bosses because of his
weight, it has been announced today.
'Porker' Mansell, as he is affectionately
known to his mates, was shocked when he
was told of the official investigation by
Zoom Zoom McGill of the Friday Felix.
"I'm shocked," said an ashen faced
Mansell, 17 stone, when confronted outside
his luxury five star restaurant. "I'm just an
ordinary bloke," he continued through
mouthfuls of spotted dick and custard.
"Sometimes 1 know I lose control a bit
over how much I eat, but this sort of
behaviour sickens me."
Fast fellow drivers had complained to
racing's top bosses that 'mouthy' Mansell
had been gaining an increasing advantage
thanks to his ballooning body. Brainy
boffin Dr. Skid from Imperial College,
Cleverland, agreed. "Fat boys like Nigel
can drive faster thanks to all the chocs and
cream cakes they stuff away," he said.
"We've carried out tests using our high-
tech Morris Mariner and extra large
members of the IC Motor Club and more
flab means more speed. I think it's
something to do with gravity and hills," he
added.
In his defence Mansell, whilst steadily
chewing through half a roast chicken,
remarked: "What do these guys know?
They're all thin and ride bicycles" .
Sir Rontontum, 78, says he can with a
Nissan.
Bruno's
KQ
Top heavyweight panto
star, Frank 'tights'
Bruno cruised to
victory in last night's
bonecrushing boxing
bout. Bruno, 27 (31
expanded), can now
look forward to his
biggest challenge yet,
when he plays the part of
'the forest' in the ICU
dramsoc production of
Babes In The Wood.
After the brawl, held
in the new Sherfield
Boxing and Dramatic
Arts Venue, frantic
Frank fans ringed the
star of scar and stage.
One of the ringside
revellers was spinster
Dani Look-Duck-Arrgh!,
16. "Frank was much
better than his 2 year old
opponent" she screamed.
