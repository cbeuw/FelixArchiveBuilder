WE'RE giving you yet another
chance to win lots of lovely lolly
this week! And we do mean chance!
We're talking super-statislically pos-
sible here, rather than actually at all
likely!! Il COULD be you, but you
have about the same chance as a
tricky tribesman in sunny Africa!!!!
So, how do you play? It's so
easy!! We've secreted a special
lucky lotto card into ten Friday
Felices. Six of these we immediately
sent out to our close relations and
partners, leaving four chirpy chances
in circulation! If you should happen
to have one of these cards then
you've already practically possibly
won!
Now look at the front of your
lotto dolly lolly card. See the bird in
the swimsuit? Scrape the silver biki-
ni of the dollies' breasts. Then match
the symbols on her twin rolundidi-
lies. If the lucky lotto's lookalike,
then you are into the next stage! And
we are off to sue the printers!!
Hang on whilst we read the
lucky lotto rulebook lo Find out what
theoretically should happen next!!
Here we are!!!!
Okay, if the breasts are a perfect
pair of Pamela's, then simply phone
our hotline number printed on this
page. IF the old bird with hard hear-
ing we employed to man the lines
four hours a day hasn't kicked the
bucket, then she may answer and
take your call! Note that lucky lotto
losers are those that haven't the
patience see it through! You have
untold millions at your fingertips so
what's a little phone bill!
Suppose, hypothetically, that
Doreen answers your call! How can
you lose now!! Watch!
Doreen will take down your
name and your improbably lucky
number, written on the back of the
lotto card. She will then post the two
to an address in Tibet. A yak train
will carry all the entries on an ardu-
ous trip across the Himalayas. Some
will get lost, some will drown in icy
water, and we'll gun down any that
get through!! Should your lucky
number carrying yak somehow make
it lo the small hovel they're aiming
for (which was napalmed by the
Chinese in 1987) then tough cheese!
It doesn't mean a thing! Get out your
electron scanning microscope and
read the small print!
In fact, I WILL WIN! The win-
ner, ME, will be wined and dined in
top London restaurants, and will be
presented with a cheque for
£ 1,000,000 at an awards ceremony
hosted by Pamela Anderson.
Stunning Pamela will have the lucky
lotto numbers painted on her chest in
edible ink! Licking them olTon-
stage may reveal a special big Friday
