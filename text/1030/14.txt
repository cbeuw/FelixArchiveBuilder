Elizabeth Hurley, 23,
wearer of 'that' dress, is
to open Imperial's new
Superconducting Centre.
Voluptuous L i z , girl-
friend of Hugh Grant, 25,
the star of the hit film Four
Weddings, said she was
delighted at the invitation.
"I'm not just a stupid
actress, you know", she told
the Friday Felix. "I've seen
IQ and know all about
Einstein."
Researchers at the
Centre are excited at the
prospect of seeing scrump-
tious Lizzy in the flesh.
"She's really a scorcher,"
one scientist said. "It'll cer-
tainly turn my heat up."
Miss Hurley's ceremony
follows Princess Anne's
opening of the Imperial
Fujitsu Centre last year.
"But this is more than just a
Royal occasion," said the
Rector, Sir Ron, yesterday.
"1 am personally planning
to take Miss Hurley out to
dinner." Sir Ron is 65, but
looks years younger.

Ex IC stunner, Mr Empire
State Building, 1785, is to
C H A N G E his name, the
Friday Felix can reveal.
After years of suffering
C R U E L jibes and N A S T Y
taunts, the sad old hack is
planning to become plain
Mr. Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Mr Building said, "I'm sick
and tired jokes about keep-
ing it up. Pisa is a far more
cultured place." An opinion
poll of Europe found that
the most popular new name
for Mr Building would be
Twat!

* Pasty Papal Priest, Father Mayii, 57,
can't believe he is Holy See-ing correct-

steeple and down the aisle with rejoicing,
so pleased is he about his new Friday Felix.
^ n d we're just happy he's so eccl-ecstatic.
PRIEST
FIAM ... Dangerous
By MARCUS ALEXANDER
E V I L self-styled 'guru'
Frater F i a m , 23, has
escaped from his prison
cell in a shockingly vio-
lent jail-break.
Mr Fiam, who liked to call
himself 'your Frater', man-
aged singlehandedly to over-
come FIVE armed guards and
evade the S Q U A D R O N S of
police who were immediately
called to the scene.
A n eyewitness who hap-
pened to be walking his dog
past the high-security Worm-
wood Scrubs prison talked
E X C L U S I V E L Y to the Friday
Felix: "I dunno what was
going on," he said.
The so-called 'Frater
Fiam' was admitted to prison
three weeks ago after being
found guilty of a series of
bizarre and horrific charges.
The Friday Felix can now
reveal the SHOCKING facts
about this lunatic cult leader.
He adopted the title 'Frater'
-which means 'brother'-when
trying to join a secret band of
SATAN-Worshippers. Since
then Mr Fiam has terrified the
public with his disturbing and
ritualistic behaviour.
In the past, Frater Fiam
has claimed: to be able to
PREDICT the future, that his
HAT allows him to talk to
SATAN, that CIGARETTES
are good for you, that he eats
BABIES and that he likes
SELF MUTILATION.
Mr Alastair Crowley, 58,
who refused to be named for
fear of being attacked by Mr
Fiam, recently talked to us
about his experiences of the
guru: "He took me to this
junkyard and started doing
this weird chanting and stuff.
It was all really sad."
