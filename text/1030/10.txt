totally harsh, fierce creas-

insanity rule the images.
No where to hide, the
portraits are cartcatures
of weakness, fault, fear.

Although my attentions to
academic studies have been
wanting, I do still take an
interest in my subject, and,
as f have this small space, I
wish to impart to you some
thoughts on e subject I have
been considering.
The subject is set theory.
Set theory examines the
characteristics and proper-
ties of mathematical sets,
end ane of its aims is to
assess their size. Consider
the set of positive integers
(1,2,3....). Set theory stafes
that this set, altbeugh infi-
nite has the same size as the
set of even integers
(2,4,6...). The reasoning is
thus • it is possible to write a
list where by each integer is
paired off with and even
integer (1-2, 2-4, 3-6 ...).
No matter how long you
continue this task, you will
always have as many inte-
gers as evens. Hence the
sets are the same size even
though the set of integers
contains the set of evens.
This is the difficult point.
Surely, I reasoned, because
both sets are infinitely long
it is not possible to reach a
stote where one can assess
their sizes or compare them.
Infinity means too large for
numbers hence mathemati-
cal operations. In no way is
one larger than the other.
1 would be interested to
hear other peoples' views
on the subject (ie we're low
on letters).
