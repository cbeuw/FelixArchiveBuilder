Next time them on the door sneer
at you for requesting a student
discount on entering a club, stand
your ground & remind them that,
without you, they wouldn't exist.
All around the West End in
the last few weeks, promoters
have been gazing glumly at
shrinking takings & uttering one
strangled word - 'exams'. Althro'
the rest of the year they hate you
(because, and believe it, you don't
spend enough at the bar), come
early summer & they'll kiss you on
entry. Without you the atmosphere
is dull, the dance floor half empty
& the promoters out of pocket. So,
go out on mass, demand group
discounts and laugh your way
through May - yours is the World
and everything that's in it.
Great stirrings are afoot at
that King of Venues, raw, at the
moment. Hall of Fame have been
removed from Saturdays creating,
great shock to all, only to be given
- within a month - Fridays.
Meanwhile, the monthly night
moves up from Friday to Saturday;
Jus' Dancin'. These guys rely on
their names for publicity and,
sickeningly, it works. However the
night lives up to its name too
because the music is so superb
that this really is all you want to
be' doin'. Tunes are dropped by
such names as Chris Phillips,
Tulley & the Soul II Soul boys -
and believe me you need to be
there for Aitch B's set. When they
had Fridays, girlies were free b4
12, but with all the current
shenanigans nothing is certain
anymore. Dress up.
s t a r s k y a n d hutch have
expanded their empire (which i
know you love because you do
keep on coming back to it) and
are now not only to be found at
the regular Weds & Thurs at
Ronnie Scotts, but also at The
Arches, Southwark St - with all the
usual perks. Big Concession guest
list to anyone who leaves their
name for me in the F E L I X office
b4 midday Fridays for the next
month.
p.s. I'm under absolute orders
to recommend v e l v e t
underground to you so, go to
Velvet Underground - it's reely
reely good. ©
Disney has always had that rare
talent for making family films; the
sort that entertain the kids and
have the parents happily snoozing
away.
So it is appears to be with
angels, the remake of the 1952
film, Angels In The Outfield. Yet
this updating does throw up some
new social aspects for the film
makers to grapple with. The basic
theme, baseball, remains same but
modern day additives such as one
parent families, foster children and
mixed-race families are introduced.
If politically correctness immed-
iately comes to mind, you'd be
right.
Roger is a foster child who
believes the only chance for his
family to get back together is if
their local baseball team, the
Angels, win the pennant. However,
as in all sports based films, the
team are a bunch of no hopers
heading for bottom of the league.
What they need is some divine
intervention, so when Roger prays
to the stars, help comes in the form
of real angels who give the team a
helping hand. (Ahhh, how sweet
and pretty!) Also, as with all proper
angels, Roger is the only person
who can see them.
When the team start winning,
their bad tempered, bad mouthed
coach, George Knox (Danny
Glover), starts to believe the kid's
visions. Roger becomes their
essential mascot, while Knox sees
his team perform miracles in the
outfield.
Angels also stars Christopher
Lloyd as an angel called Al, wild
and wacky as ever, and Tony Danza
almost unrecognisable as the burnt
out pitcher whose talent was
abused by Knox in a previous
baseball team.
But Angels is sentimental and
bland; Disney production at its
peak. With $50 million taken at the
US box office, it just goes to show
that family films can still profitably
exist even with those happy
endings.
So there's really only one
reason for seeing this film and
that's keeping young ones occupied
for about an hour and a half. ©
