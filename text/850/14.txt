Guilds Carnival—tonight!
Tonight is the Guilds Carnival which is probably the
best event in Rag Week. There will be two bands
playing. The Man From Delmonte are from
Manchester and played at College last year, and were
extremely popular. The music is great to dance to but
listen to the lyrics as well. Howling Wilf & The Vee-
jays are a favourite band at IC and are guaranteed
to get the party going.
Apart from the bands there is a disco from 8pm until
3am, videos all evening and 2 films-The F/y and The
Secret Policeman's Other Ball. There is a bar extension
until 2am, and the infamous Rugby Club Cocktails will
again be making an appearance. Burgers will be on
sale outside the Union Building in Beit Quad.
For anyone who didn't get tickets to the Freshers'
Ball here's your chance to experience an IC party at
its best. Entrance is only £4.50 and doors open at
8pm, so come along and have a great night.

The first meeting of the ICU Postgraduate Group
(ICUPGG) was held on the 7th of this month. The main
conclusion to come out of this meeting was that the
Department Postgraduate Groups needed to be firmly
established. The Department PG Groups are of great
importance, and it's very unfortunate that at the
present they are virtually non-existent. These groups
serve two main purposes. Firstly, to organise and help
in PG activities within the departments; and secondly,
they are vital organs of the ICUPGG and without them
there exists virtually no interdepartmental
communication between PGs.
If you are interested in forming a Department PG
Group or just getting involved, write to me through
the Union Office.
