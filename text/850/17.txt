Pornography
This has been an odd week. I have never worked on
an issue during which so much discussion ensued on
one subject. Pornography is a taboo area, often
sniggered about by 15 year old school boys but rarely
mentioned publicly. It raises strong feelings in women
especially, since they are so often the losers in this
degrading pastime. During this week I became more
and more aware of what I really wanted to do with
this feature. The idea started out as a take-off of this
month's Cosmopolitan and ended, I hope, as a serious
article on something which affects us all, whether we
use it or not.
I came to the conclusion that, at all costs, I must
avoid anything which would become pornography
itself. I wanted something which would offend the
people who buy pornography. I felt that an image of
two men was the only source for this purpose; the
majority of the market is aimed at heterosexual men,
after all. I hope I have succeeded in not only raising
people's awareness but in disgusting the very people
who continue to fund this multi-million pound
industry.
My own views on the subject, did change as I
realised how synonomous the industry was with the
world of drugs. If you buy a copy of Sunday Sport or
Brain Damage, you are helping to fund and continue
one of the more perverse areas of our society. If you
organise an Ann Summers party for women, you are
supporting their abuse in magazines such as
Whitehouse. This is frightening. What is more
worrying is the way in which you can rapidly gain
contacts in the illegal 'hard-core' areas through
advertisements in 'soft' magazines.
I believe that Clare Short, MP is now organising a
petition against pornography. Maybe the heightened
media attention which the issue is now receiving will
promote her cause; I hope it will. It would be nice to
see exactly who flings insults this time if the matter
is discussed during a televised period of the House of
Commons, but I doubt this will happen. If the problem
is as prevalent as our feature would indicate, the
television companies involved must be riddled with
opponents to Ms Short's point.
I am sure that this issue will have upset some
women. I am very sorry if it has upset anybody other
than momentarily, apart from the people who it was
meant to offend. Think about what you are doing, is
the only comment I can pass to these people. If you
want to live your life on paper, then I hope you die
alone and unhappy in some festering slum that
reminds you of the sordidness of the whole affair.
For those interested, the research material has been
destroyed.
Discussion groups
The discussion group which talked about Pornography
was interesting and informative. I would like to
arrange another meeting to discuss other 'taboo'
topics. If anyone is interested in being a part of such
a group, they should contact me via the internal mail.
Everything will be handled with strict confidentiality.
Be warned, however, that the subjects under debate
may be embarassing to talk about; you may wish to
join in as a group of friends.
Comic
I hope to feature a comic in this year's Christmas
issue. If anybody fancies submitting anything from a
full page cartoon to a single boxed drawing, I would
be most grateful to hear from them. This is your
newspaper, put something into it!
Photographers
FELIX needs photographers to cover events in and
around College. If you are a budding David Bailey or
don't know what a lens cap is, please pop in if you
fancy helping.
