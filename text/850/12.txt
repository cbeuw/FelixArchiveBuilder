MacPlaymaie. A computerprogramfor titilation or amusement? The graphics have areas programmedfor arms, legs, torso
and head, which mow independently in a very unnatural manner. Other examples of computer pornography include 'Maxi
Headboom' and 'Squirt', in which a woman is shown reclining, withfluidsquirting from her breast occasionally.
found videos contained scenes in which 'women were
'fist-fucked', buggered, used as animals, enjoyed
humiliation, urinated in each other's mouths and were
shown shaven, with labia rings and chains (pierced
labia with rings inserted and chained together)'. They
claim that R and 18 rated films show the same
messages with some of the more explicit scenes
edited out. Pornographic videos can now be obtained
in petrol stations as well as video shops and many
large chains of hotels have 'adult' channels available
as part of room service, without the need for a licence.
Where is the dividing line between a 'porn' film such
as Erotic Eva (advertised in Fiesta) in which we are
promised 'Eva, a snake dancer-beautiful, erotic and
loves all warm long slithery things. Explicit and candid
photography shows some amazing sexual tricks';
Scandal in which an orgy is shown where the butler
wears a sign saying 'beat me if I fail to please' and
an 'Art' film such as The Cook, the Thief, his Wife
and her Lover where Helen Mirren and Alan Howard
make love in various bizarre situations such as a
lavatory and a restaurant pantry without even having
exchanged names? The only answer can be in terms
of the 'message' of the films. The plot of Erotic Eva
presumably revolves around sex. Scandal aims to
titillate but has a plot line which is not solely
concerned with displaying sex but which purports to
make a statement about the way in which society
viewed Christine Keiller and her male friends. The
Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover used sex to
explore the liberation of the Wife from domination by
the Thief, showed her emerging as a strong and
dominant figure in control of her own destiny. But
does this existence of a storyline still qualify such a
use of sex? Films such as this are frequently 'sold' on
the basis of their sexual content. A stance no better
than that of 'Erotic Eva,' in some eyes.
This brings us to the fundamental question of: what
is pornography? The dictionary definition is clearly
incomplete. Many of the people looking at the material
described here were not sexually stimulated, but
definitely considered it pornographic. Many of the
themes that were commented upon again and again
concerned the images of the women portrayed. 'John'
said 'they lead men into thinking '
I can dominate
women and I can have them because they are
submissive'. 'Richard' said 'magazines like
Whitehouse and Rodox ate showing women to be
objects for sex with no redeeming features and that
is possibly dangerous.'
There are no strong links between pornography and
crimes of violence against women such as rape, but
pornography has been shown to make 'ordinary' men
see themselves as more likely to commit rape, less
likely to respond sympathetically to rape victims and
more likely to be lenient to rapists. [Pornography and
Sexual Violence: Evidence of the Links, published by
Everywoman.) 'Richard' said 'magazines, particularly
those which involve men dominating women, will
quite likely nurture in a dangerous way the existing
psychoses of people who buy them'.
The stronger magazines showed the general themes
of women thrusting their crotches to the camera,
begging for sex, domination and violence. They
showed them wanting to be used and abused sexually
as they go about their daily business. The material we
had was mostly at the 'soft' end of the market, but
nevertheless disturbed some of the people who looked
at it, in particular the subliminal messages in the
magazines. Some areas were felt to be amusing or
faintly ridiculous. In the final analysis, erotic pictures
and writing are not in themselves damaging, and may
be aesthetically pleasing. They may help both
individuals and couples in their sex lives, but such
material ought to be sensitive, thoughtful and give
equal status to all its participants and readers. With
the exception of some parts of Playgirl, none of the
material discussed had these qualities.
Yes, pornography may stop a potential rapist going
out and raping someone. But that is only because it
has replaced rape with porn: rape and other sexual
crimes are not about sex but about power.
Pornography is also not about sex but about power.
A new definition of pornography should be
established: pornographic material is anything which
portrays human beings taking part in humiliating,
fantastical or degrading activities, whether sexual or
not.
There is a law against distributing literature which
'incites racial hatred'. It is called the Race Relations
Act of 1976. Material showing coloured or Jewish
people being beaten, humiliated or sexually degraded
would cause an uproar if sold. Why is there no law
to protect fifty per cent of the population from the
same thing?
A word of
warning
The humorous side of the soft porn trade displays
an easy path to the hard core extremes. The
Sunday Sport displays advertisements for
telephone numbers as well as sex shops. Buying
a 'soft' magazine such as Whitehouse from one
of these stores, including Ann Summers opens up
a world of hard core degradation to the eager
customer. Under Construction was purchased
from a shop advertised in Whitehouse. The
bookshop was housed in a bare room with
portable shelves, easily transportable in the case
of a police raid. Extreme hard-core pornography
is just like any other illegal trade it seems: there
is an easy way in for anybody who wants to join,
and it may be sitting on your breakfast table this
Sunday.
