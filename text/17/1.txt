produced EVIDENCE - 1) The book (of the f i l m - of
the p l a y - of the book which *was banned) and 2-
the p l a y - of the book which was Banned) and 2) M i s s
B l a n d i s h , i n a 2-dimensional p r o j e c t i o n - selected-
from 200 o f f e r e d from a n o t a b l e c o l l e c t i o n .
