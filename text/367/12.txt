For sheer variety and interest, engineering in ICI takes
some beating. Nationally and internationally, we're
expanding and diversifying - in the UK alone £200
million worth of new plant is being put in hand this year.
Engineers (particularly mechanical) are at the heart of
this effort, and can expect opportunities and pro-
motion in relation to its size. Before ICI interviewers
visit in the Spring, ask your appointments service for
more information, including a copy of our booklet
'Careers for graduates'- it will give you some idea of
ICI's scope, management style and attitudes to social
and environmental issues.

This advertisement was
brought to our notice by Martin
Turner and appeared in The
Daily Telegraph of Wednesday,
23rd October, 1974. Here is
in fact a Miss Georgina
Greene, and a Mr. J.S. Oakley,
in the Chem. Eng. department,
the former being secretary to
the Head of Department,
Prof. A.R. Ubbelohde and
the latter the Departmental
Superintendent. Does anyone
in Chem. Eng. claim any
responsibility for this?
ICWA JULIA DUNNING
TO THE MEN OF I.C. - TAKE HEED OF OUR FEMALE CHAUVINISM!
DO YOU have the qualities women look for? Can you keep an
audience of impressipnabieyoung females riveted to your KNEES?!
For at least five minutes? If so, then you could be the next
Mr. ICWA, 1974-75 (there's the added incentive of a pot in the
Union Bar!). You would, of course, be the only male member of
this noble organisation, as
well as having"the most soft
after knees in London! Seriously
and the job IS intact to be
seriously contested, we
welcome A L L gentlemen to
consider entering and to come
along and pit their wits, or,
in actuality, their knees, in
the Annual MR. ICWA
KNOBBLY KNEES competition
to be held on Tuesday, 5th
November at 12.30p.m. in the
ICWA Lounge. Refreshments
in the form of Cheese and
Wine will be available.
This infact, will be a
General Meeting of IGWA and
as such I hope as many of our
members as possible will
come along and take part in
the voting of MR. ICWA. A
Freshers Rep. for the Com-
mittee has also to be elected.
We are also in need of ideas
for a Rag stunt. If anyone has
any ideas could they please
let me know.
If any of you are interested,
the IC Darts team is trying
to get together a Ladies Darts
team. If you are, they can be
contacted most lunch-times
in the Union Bar through
Malcolm Ransom, or you can
get in touch through me (I'm
in my room most lunch-times
i.e. 98 Beit).
I should also like to draw
your attention to the fact that
the Rugby Club are holding a
Bonfire party at H'arlington on
Sunday. I have been asked to
extend a cordial invitation to
all ICWA members to attend.
Apart from that I think it
should be good fun — they're
certainly making an effort to
make the evening a success.
So if you can go, do so.
Well, that's all folks, I hope
you all enjoyed the Hallowe'en
do last night. See you on
Monday.
