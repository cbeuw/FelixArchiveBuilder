L A S T YEAR postgraduates all over the country campaigned
for £2 per hour for demonstrating in practicals because that was
considered to be a fair rate for the job. At IC the campaign was
strong and a satisfactory agreement with the College was reached.
Basically that agreement was that we be paid £2 per hour for
session 74/75, with that rate tied to the lower end of the lecturers
pay scale, subject to any national agreement. (If we had had this
agreement in 73/74, the rate for 74/75 would have been £2.27
by the way). However there was one unsatisfactory aspect,being
that of tutorials which too are to be paid at £2.00 per hour —
which we considered to be ridiculous.
However, now all that
now all that is
passed. There has not been a
national agreement, but a
national dictate from the
C V C P . A C V C P committee
consisting of our own Sir
Brian, the Secretary of
Edinburgh University (where
they have had demonstrating
rate campaigns culminating
in a strike) and two other
vice-chancellors have made
a report. In fact, it is a very
good report, it recommends the
rate be tied to the lecturers
pay scale and several other
things we've been asking for.
?lut it does recommend an
ourly rate including pre-
paration time for demonstrating
at a minimum of £1.50 and for
tutorial a minimum of £2.70.
In itself this is fine, it is a
question ' of interpretation.
The report has been
interpreted by the,University
of London Collegiate Council
which has made the following
recommendations:
1) Demonstrating rate including
preparation time shall be
£1.50 per hour;
2) Tutorial rate including
preparation time shall be
£2.70 per hour.
3) These rates shall be
reviewed annually.
The Collegiate Council's
report has in turn been
interpreted by the College.
Sir Brian Flowers verbally
told us of the College's
position when asked at Union
Council about the tutorial rate.
1) No postgraduates may give
tutorials at IC, therefore
£ 5 0 , 0 0 0
THE RENT STRIKE FUND at Birmingham University now
stands at a total of jnst over £50,000.
Sources there say the size of this sum is obviously worrying
the University, who are reported to be trying all the tricks in the
book to entice people to pay their rent to them and not into the
Rent Fund.
One reaction has been for a
hall manager to instruct the
cleaning staff to tighten
enforcement of the hall rules.
This means people with 'illegal
guests' 'will be reported,
students must ' be out by
9.30p.m., and no extra items of
furniture will be allowed. This
is rumoured to include stereo
systems.
As yet the only real con-
cession from the University
has been that the late payment
fee of £2 will not be levied
until the November review has
taken place. This is no
concession to the demands of
the Birmingham Students
Union.
It is hoped that the Rent
Strike Fund total will soon
reach the target of £70,000.

no-one need be paid for them.
2) Qur £2 per hour for de-
monstrating will not be cut
(big deal!) but it will not go up
either, until the £1.50 we
would have had, increasing
annually, reaches £2. In other
words, over the next few years
the value of our demonstrating
earnings will be cut by 25%
due to inflation.
It will be remembered that
most postgraduates were
earning £1.50 in session
72/73. We have had at least
30% inflation since then.
You may be thinking that
well, at least the College has
kept the Postgraduate Group
in the picture. But that is not
true. We have only heard about
the report of the CVCP and
the Collegiate Council through
the Students' Union of another
London College. That is not
good enough. It makes student
representation a farce when
they are not told of the final
decisions. I have no doubt we
would not have heard to this
day if we had not had the
information from elsewhere.
Now it is quite true that the
actual number of hours
demonstrating is likely to be
cut quite drastically in the
near future due to economies
in the College. Although that
is to be opposed, the actual
rate should not be allowed to
fall as a consequence. If that
were to happen when the money
supply improved, the whole
campaign would have to start
again.
I will end with some
questions which must be
answered:-
1) Why have the 'minima' of the
CVCP report become the
'maxima' of the Collegiate
Council report and the targets
for this College?
2) Why is there not at least a
London Weightingonthe minima?
3) Is not the £1.50 as arbitrary
a figure, if not more so, than
the £2.00 the students and the
AUT consider to be fair?
4) Perhaps this is the most
important question. If the
College believes in student
representation, in return is it
not fair that we be kept
informed of decisions made at
College level which affect us?
Is not the present system of
representation a farce?
