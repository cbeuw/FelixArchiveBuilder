FEUX
cAUDIO TAIR
THIS year's Audio Fair opened
at Olympia on Monday. The current
trend in the Hi-Fi trade is towards
the top end of the market with
individual units costing many
hundreds of pounds. This trend
was certainly reflected at the
fair. The advent of Quadraphonics
has brought in a glut of new
Japanese electronics from Sony,
Sanyo etc. The Marantz 4240 four
channel tuner-amp is fairly
typical, priced at £335.70.
Despite the increase in
average prices due to the in-
troduction of new and exotic
equipment, prices have been
remarkably stable in the Audio
industry. This price stability
coupled with the increased choice
of cheap and good Hi-fi equipment
has led to the under appeal of the
Fair. Not only are hi-fi units
being demonstrated and shown,
there are competitions, models,
lectures, and now inevitable
appearances by disc jockeys from
Capitol and tne BBC.

Interest in audio/visual
displays seems to be on the
increase with several films
showing light display units which
supposedly react to the sounds
being played. Their efforts were
both disappointing and expensive
but the idea is an interesting one.
Undoubtedly, the emphasis of
the Fair is on Quadraphonics and
cassette units. Caution has been
abandoned on both fronts. All the
foreign manufacturers are backing
at least one of the three most
popular Quadraphonic systems
without waiting for any one to
become accepted as 'standard'.
Judging from the demonstrations
which I heard on Monday none of
the systems is a significant
improvement over a good stereo.
Perhaps, it is profits and not
sound quality which has brought
in quadraphonics so rapidly.
Cassettes have obviously come
to stay although certainly not
taking over from records yet.
The quality obtainable from
cassettes can now be as good as
that from expensive open-reel
tape machines. A top quality
cassette machine such as the .
Nikamichi costs over £400 but
many models from the Akai range
were more realistically priced at
under £100. Of the many new
cassette units on display at the
Fair, perhaps the most interesting
was the Uher CFS210, a pocket
size portable stereo cassette
recorder, a unique machine at the
unique price of £280 (plus VAT)!

IT is not often that something completely new appears
on the Hi-Fi scene but Gale Electronics have achieved this
with their GT 2101 turntable.
The designer of the turntable, Dennis Arnall, is a former
gyroscope designer and has incorporated a great deal of
advanced technology to
make this turntable unique.
The turntable platter is
directly coupled to the
DC servo motor.and the
speed is measured by a
pulse counter coupled to
the motor shaft. To
provide a reference time
base for speed measure-
ment and control a crystal
oscillator operating at
5.0 Megahertz is used,
thus ensuring that the
speed selected is entirely
independent of mains
voltage or frequency. The
speed is contihously
adjustable from 10 rpm to
99 rpm and is indicated
by a digital readout.
The other feature of
the turntable which was
emphasised by the designer
is the suspension and
bearing system, the main
body of the tgrntable is
supported on three min-
iature shock absorbers
while the-main bearing Of
the GT 210T uses a new
magnetic material and
allocs the platter to
'float' in a magnetic field.
This system essentially
isolates the turntable
from external shocks and
eliminates low frequency
bearing noise.
The price of this
beautiful toy is expected
to be around £450, so
start saving now! The
prototype model seen
at the Audio Fair is made
out of perspex but Mr.
Arnali informs me that
production models will be
made of glass.
It is unfortunate that
this superbly designed
turntable should be priced
beyond nearly everyone's
reach. Why should anyone
pay £450 when the only
way of distinguishing
between the Gale and a
turntable costing around
£100 is by using sophis-
ticated test equipment?
On the other hand if you
demand perfection
