ONCE UPON a time there was a little girl who grew up into a
big girl. Came the day to leave school and our big girl didn't
know what to do so she stood in her shoes and she wonder'd,
she wonder'd, she stood in her shoes and she wonder'd, and then
ended up at the French Institute. Which just goes to show that
big girls don'tthink very much.
Who would willingly submit
herself to two years of mind-
bending in order to become a
SECRETARY or, glory of
glories, a PERSONAL ASS-
ISTANT, a mere dogsbody, a
50/120 word a minute machine,
a fool, a carbon copied, paper
spewing, coffee making; finger
chewing, form filing, phone
dialling, letter sealing, ribbon
reeling, stamp lickingmachine?
Oh, I've seen it happen.
Hundreds of them setting out
answering advertisements for
secretaries, planning to become
managing directors, working
hard, climbing the ladder, row-
towing, boot flcking, and after
ten years what are they?
Secretaries. Because strangely
enough when someone ad-
vertises for a secretary that
is exactly what he wants, and
if he was to suspect you of
coveting his job you'd be out
on your ear.
The most frightening part
of it is the almost imperceptible
transition from student to
secretary, so imperceptible
that the poor girl herself
doesn't even realise it. She
arrives one bright September
morning at IF, wide-eyed,
lively, imaginative, ambitious,
full of hope. But little does
she know. The brain-washing
The charming young lady
in the picture is Fiona George.
She is this year's 'Queen of
Jez' and a real asset to
Physics I. This windswept
beauty from Portsmouth will
be even more windswept on
the Brighton run. Fortunately,
she is being lent a great coat
by someone. She is a keen
sailor and since coming to IC
has been involved with the
RCSU.

begins. She is haunted by the
vision of a monster: her future
boss. Who knows who it might
be? Perhaps a graduate from
IC. Oh, yes the very ones who
had been so friendly in her
student days — transformed
info monsters. There he sits
behind his desk, surrounded by
papers and telephones and
reports and figure sheets and
trying to look important,
plumped,up on his two cushions,
mentally undressing his
secretary and dictating at a
speed of 150 words a minute,
the brute! The one whose
pencils she must sharpen,
Whose diary she must keep,
whose girlfriend' she must buy
for, whose'wife she'must lie
to,: whose temper must be
soothed arid whose martini
must be shaken but not stirred.
Well girls this is why we
are at IF — to learn how to
boost the male ego. There are
just four things to remember:
al Your boss is always right,
therefore b) You are always
wrong, therefore c) You are
inferior, therefore d) You will
always be inferior.
But all hope is not lost —
the day of the female boss, and
the male secretary will soon
be upon us. Sp do not despair,
exert yourself and remember
that we at IF were meant for
tiner things!
Meanwhile, on the home
front, we have set a date for
bur 'Vicars and Tarts' party.
Barring hell and high water,
we will be having it on the
29th of November, and the
proceeds will be going to the
rag charities. For those of you
who are .a little thick, I will
explain that you have to come
dressed as either a vicar or a
tart, the choice is yours (this
is where members of Gaysoc
have a chance to shine).
Anyway what the hell, it's all
in a good cause so off with
your inhibitions and on With
your dog collar!

THE UNION building is not looking too good at the present
time. There are too many old posters, signs, bottles etc. and far
too much litter in general. The Executive has therefore, begun
to take action against those who cause this mess. If your club
or society has any old posters up in the building, be warned.
Someone will take them down, and if it is a member of the
Executive, the owners of the posters will probably be the
subject of a discipline meeting. One group has already been
fined for not removing old signs.
On the other side of the coin, the House Committee is
looking for ways to improve the general appearance of the
rooms. A coat of paint, a new curtain, a quick polish, anything
to make the building a little more attractive. If you have any
ideas, drop me a line through the internal post and I'm sure
something can be done about it.('Spitoons for the Union Office'
is probably the only idea which we will not be seriously
considering).
On a more general note, if anything in the Union building,
or the JCR or the Southside lounges is not working, or is
broken then please tell me — 'cos that's the quickest way to
get it fixed.
