THE WEEKEND before last was
taken up by the now-notorious Executive
weekend. We spent two days discussing
the major areas of the Union's work in
broad terms and trying to work out the
best courses for the Union to take,
which areas needed special attention
and so on. It is, perhaps, worthwhile
to make the point that the four non-
sabbatical members of the Executive
were prepared to spend these two days
in this way, and to take a full part in
the discussion and to contribute as
much as the full-timers. I am particularly
pleased that the CCU Presidents are
determined to play a positive role
within the Executive, rather than leaving
everything to thetwosabbatical officers,
and without neglecting their CCU duties.
One of the major areas that we hope
to pay special attention to is that of
Academic Affairs; it is surprising that
such a central issue to students, that
is, the actual mechanics of education
and training, the kind of courses
provided, and the kind and standard of
teaching, has been so totally neglected
by the central bodies and figures in the
Union, over the past few years. The
drive to diversify courses, and to give
the opportunity for more non-technical
studies has stopped, at least from
within the Union.
It is now time to change that state
of affairs, as I indicated in my PreciPice
in the Freshers' issue of FELIX.
Clearly, given the Rector's comments
in respect of University finance, the
College will be constrained by the
lack of money. However, the Planning
Committee is now trying to work out
the College's submission to the
University Grants Committee, for the
next 'five-year plan'. I think that it is
right for us to start now, generating
discussion and deciding the way that
students wish to see the College going.
In terms of academic development, I
believe that many students would like
to see major emphasis placed on
expanding Associated and Interdis-
ciplinary Studies (AIDS). The last
meeting of the AIDS Committee did
review the history and discuss the
future of AIDS. It seems that Associated
Studies, that is, courses involving
disciplines not taught in the College,
(Economics, for example) are being
taken up by more and more students.
I am glad to see that an expansion in
the field of languages is envisaged.
I hope that this will encompass the
customs and culture of other countries;
what use is a mere mechanical know-
ledge of a language for true con:
munication?
In the interdisciplinary field, however,
when one disregards the 'service'
courses, for example Maths tor Biologists,
one is left with almost no courses that
'illustrate the unity and inter-relation
of knowledge'. The one example that
immediately springs to mind is 'En-
viroment and Man', and perhaps, the
projected 'Energy Studies'. What I hope
to see developing is more courses, like
these, which tackle a specific scientific
and/or technological topic, in an
intellectually stimulating way, drawing
upon two or more disciplines for their
course material. Perhaps in this way,
we can provide alternatives to a few of
the narrow, uninspiring courses which
exist in all departments.
As important to every student as
what he learns, is how he learns. I
understand that there are now efforts
afoot to do something about the stand-
ards of teaching by making a require-
ment for a lecturer's appointment that
he undergo an approved course in
teaching methods. About time, I reckon.
However, the length and standards
suggested seem woefully inadequate to
me. In the week or two, which appears
to be the norm, only the most superficial
aspects of delivery and technique can
be covered. What is really needed is a
course extending over a term or a year,
covering the theory of education,
teaching methods, use of audio-visual
aids, and university administration.
The dual function of the College as
both an institution of instruction and
discovery, of teaching and research
must always be kept in mind; whilst I
do not subscribe to the view that all
members of staff must necessarily teach
T r e v o r P h i l l i p s
as well as do research, I believe that
we must work to make Imperial College
fulfil both its educational roles to the
full.
The Rector, on Commemoration Day,
made several comments in respect of
student grants, which I welcome. I am
pleased, not so much by what he said,
as by the fact that, unlike many Vice-
Chancellors, he has not been afraid to
speak out in favour of students'
interests.
In his speech the Rector recognised
one of the crucial problems that we
continue to fight through the Grants
Campaign — that the new levels of
grants have 'been considerably eroded
already by inflation', and that one effect
of this erosion has been that 'universities
themselves have been forced to raise
substantially those rents and refectory
charges on which Government funded
subsidies are not permitted'.
These words, I think, contradict the
Rector's hope, expressed earlier, that
the question of grants would not prove
to be a 'significant factor' this year.
They rather point to ah intensified and
stronger campaign, which will con-
centrate on the effects of the cuts in
the education budget, and the aspects
of the grants system about which we,
like the Rector 'are not satisfied'.
And I think immediately of the triple
injustices of the means test (both
parental and spouses'), the discri-
mination against married women, and
discretionary awards.
The Rector identified a target of
£100 rise in the next grants award; this
is too low to keep pace with 20%
inflation. However, we applaud the
fact, that he has put a real figure on
his words of support for the second
year running.
The Grants Campaign Week of Action
is-November 1lth-15th, with a Day of
Cross-Binary Action of the 13th, and a
National Day of Action, includinq a
demo on Friday the 15th. Look out for
more news, as we have a UGM decision
to support the Week of Action
