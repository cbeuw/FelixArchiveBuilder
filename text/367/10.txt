FOLK CLUB claims yet
another success. Everyone
was unanimous that the Swan
Arcade concert was an un-
qualified success.
We were happy — No, this
is not the Queen writing — to
welcome back Tim Brookes —
a previous Folk Club Sec-
retary — and Mike Peale —
an erstwhile Publicity Officer
of the aforementioned wonderful
society. Both of these did
regular floor spots last year.
Tim sang several of his own
compositions. Mike sang songs
from his native Geordieland,
so I couldn't understand a
word — which on some occ-
asions was a good thing —
I'm too young to hear such
lurid lyrics. However, the
tunes were good but they
didn't help us breathe more
easily — it was stifling in
there. (Sorry about that pun
but what can you expect after
N Guinnesses? Guinni??).
Back to the subject, Mikes's
ghost song 'If only my mummy
had told me, but she was too
wrapped up to care — think
about it', was a very amusing
spectrecle. Sorry — I'm good
at bad puns.
Swan Arcade - a Yorkshire
band — described themselves:
'We used to be a folk group,
but now we're a bit different
from what we were'. They
play electric traditional folk-
if such a thing exists. On the
whole, they were very popular-
even if a certain lady did
plunge them into darkness for
the duration of one song.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
dig — but it was a stupid thing
to do. The group did one
encore and despite cries of
'encore de encore' - cringe -
finished at 11.00 prompt.
Hurray! Folk club finished on
time for once. On a more
serious note (B flat for
example) would our members
please note that NO glasses
are allowed in the refectory.
Thank You.
I think it's about time I
finished burbling on aim-
lessly and went to the bar -
No, I didn't say that, I really
meant go and do some work —
(that's my story and I'm
sticking to it, until I can
think up a better one).
JAZZ CLUB
N.V.Morrison
SUNDAY nights can be the
most boring and depressing
time of the week, with nothing
to look forward to and precious
little on television. That's
why, under the auspics of IC
Jazz Club, Sunday sessions
were introduced to provide a
wide range of music at a price
we can all afford, i.e. it's free!
These not to be missed
events, are held in the Union
lower lounge and usually start
about 8.30p.m. The music
ranges from rock through blues
to ragtime and even Jazz and
is mostly provided by amateur
or semi-pro' bands with the
odd big name amongst them.
Next Sunday we will feature
an entertaining little Trad,
group called 'Tyger' band, so
pull up a pint and pop in.
Last Sunday (20th October),
'Inspector Lloyd', a highly
proficient Blues-rock band,
who featured Paul Goose on
drums, were our guests. They
played a mixture of blues
classics, such as John Mayall's
'The Bear' and their own
material. The musicianship,
particularly of the bassist and
tenor sax player, was of a very
high order and was well
appreciated by an almost
capacity audience.
This space
is empty.

LAST SATURDAY an intercollegiate chess competition was
held at ULU. It went off not too badly considering that the
tournament organiser was still- recovering from the Materials
Science freshers dinner the night before.
IC entered two teams which were much weaker than they
could have been (due to the
great enthusiasm engendered
by Messrs Heppell and Delnon)
but nevertheless did very well.
University College won the
competition quite convincingly
but the two IC teams finished
second and fourth (out of eight).
Special mention must go to
Bob Wren, who scored two out
of three on top board for IC 1st;
Silvio 2

; Warwick Grigg 3;
and Dave Edwards who scored

make up a team).

who helped clearupafterwards.
