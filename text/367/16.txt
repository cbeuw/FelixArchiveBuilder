IC 1st X V arrived at Harlington only 90 minutes late due to
another WAFU with Garners coaches much to the disgust of
oerselves and the opposition. The match eventually got underway
and the first encounters suggested that IC were in for a hard time.
The Rosslyn Park back row dominated the loose ball and
although at this stage fair
ball was being supplied by
the IC front five this proved
insufficient to hold the rampart
Park team. Within twenty
minutes IC were 10 points
behind from a goal and a try.
This deficit was cut by a,
Finney penalty after a late|
tackle on Cresswell and from
this stage until half time IC
dominated the match. After
initial work by Robbins, Fearn
pushed his way over for a
good try giving a half time
score of 14-7.
At this stage things were
in ICs favour as they turned
around with the slight slope
and wind in their favour. The
IC front five had begun to get
on top and had executed one
tremendous scrum shove
sending the Park pack back
ten yards. Lineout ball was
also going their way.
It was not to be, however.
The Park continued to win the
vast majority of the loose ball
,and threw the ball around in
seven a side fashion. They
dominated the half completely
showing IC the way with their
speed and skill. More to the
point they showed a brand of
confidence and fitness which
IC could not even contemplate
matching. To their credit the
IC team never gave up even
in the face of a tremendous
barrage of tries. The Park in
fact, ran in six tries in the
second half without reply from
IC, giving a final score of
44-7. IC were well beaten but
not disgraced.

Once again the intrepid International X V , with their new
overseas player, set out to do battle last Saturday against the
less known KCS Old Boys. For the first time in our history we
managed to arrive at the oppositions ground before the home
team, which left us some time to workout some 'plays' (Courtesy

Wednesday the 23rd, saw
IC Football Club hosts to their
old rivals University College
at Harlington with the first
3 teams participating.
The first team, inspite of
windy conditions, played some
inspired football with the
midfield taking control early
on and moving the ball about
speedily and precisely. Glen
Swaby put in an excellent
performance on the day and
so to did veteran Colin
Highan who netted two of the
goals with fierce first time
shots. Up front, persistent
running by ageless Bob Day
and newcomer Steve Gee
always had the UC defence on
edge. Bob, in one sortie,
proved much too fast for the
opposing centrebacks when
he ran through to push the
ball past the goalkeeper with
consummate ease.
The second team, in a very
disappointing performance went
down 3-0, while the thirds
after a brave fight in an
evenly balanced game lost
2-1; Phil Singleton outstanding
for the home side.
On Saturday the annual
outing to Oxford came to pass.
The firsts in an exciting, if
not the most entertaining of
games, scraped a 2-1 victory
over a useful St Edmund's
Hall side. After scoring the
equaliser, Ian Hyslop, in a
neat interchange, laid on the
second for our Dreaded
Russian, centreforward with
only minutes remaining.
The depleted second team
were predictably defeated by
New College 6-3. Several of
our players, however, turned
on some good football, in
particular, Gerry Lindon who
showed some nice touches up
front. The other game played
was that between Hertford
College and our third team,
also without many of their
stars, and this ended in a
3-3 draw. The highlight of the
match was the reappearance
in an 1C shirt of Rob 'The
General' Carty, a club com-
mittee member of some years
ago and now an old boy, who
celebrated his comeback by
scoring all three goals for IC.
Evening entertainment was
provided by Rog Hunter, who
once more demonstrated his
phenomenal drinking powers.

seemed designed for mice
rather than men but by working
out a shift system we all
managed to change in time for
kick off.
The game started evenly
with both sides trying hard to
obtain the initial advantages.
In one of the many periods of
pressure from IC, we were
awarded a penalty, which Neil
Hicking only narrowly failed
with. However, not losing
heart at this IC kept going
forwards and after a long spell
of pressure a try finally came.
A good run by Ned ended with
a loose nick, the ball came
back quickly to Graham
Battenshaw, who sent a pass
to Gwyn Davies. Gwyn made a
clean break and sent Jon
(I've scored in every game)
Pitcher over in the corner.
Needless to say Rob Jones
failed with the conversion.
Thus at half time IC were
leading 4-0.
The second half saw IC
doing all the pressurising and
frequently Chris Whiteley
made crashing breaks through
the middle only to be tackled
short on most occasions. By
now the forwards had complete
dominance and outstanding
performances were made by Ian
Eleanor and Flourisch
Schocking, our new No. 8.
The continual attacking caused
our downfall and KCS made a
break from bad handing in our
backs and a lucky try was
scored. The score now being
4-4, IC put all they had into
the last five or so minutes but
once again, we were stopped
short every time, so the score
remained the same, although
it was a moral victory to IC.
Well played lads!
