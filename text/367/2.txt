2 FELIX
e d i t o r i a l
M i k e W i l l i a m s
ON FRIDAY, 29th November, there
will not be a FELIX on the newstands.
No, we will not be skiving off, giving
up or messing around in the slightest.
FELIX will appear the week before
(November 22nd) and the week after
(December 6th); but the latter issue
will be a very special issue indeed, so
special that the FELIX staff will need
a fortnight to prepare for it as opposed
the usual week. Why is it sx> special?
Just think a moment. Then look at the
front page of this issue. What does it
say under the Cat? 'FOUNDED IN 1949'.
FELIX No. I actually appeared on
December 9th, 1949; so the special
issue on December 6th, 1974 will be
the 25th Anniversary Issue.
It is hoped to include some colour
photographs on the cover.
In addition, we are organising a
25th Anniversary Dinner to which we
hope to get as many past Editors along
as possible. That will be on Monday
December 2nd, and it is hoped that one
of the colour photographs which will be
taken at the dinner will be ready to go
into the 25th Anniversary Issue, so if
you wish to be recorded in the annals
of FELIX history (in living colour,
no less), book your ticket for the
dinner now.
It appears that the Treasure Hunt
devised by C & GU for RCSU so that
they might retrieve their lost •mascot
Theta is going very well indeed. FELIX
will be running a feature when it has
finished — there is too great a risk of
the news becoming incredibly stale
were we to attempt a running feature.
The latest news that we have is that
Martin Kessler, the RCSU V.P., went
almost to the extremities of the Central
Line, attempting to purchase a £5 postal
order from Ongar Post Office. It is
understood that he arrived at 12.30
'just as the Post Office was closing for
lunch!'. Tough scheiss, Martin.
It is sincerely hoped, at the time of
writing, that all promises of insertions
for small ads will be honoured this week.
To make doubly sure that we have room
a 16-page issue has been produced. A
16-pager is a very, very painful
experience, let me tell you.

Dear Sir,
It appears that on Monday
30th September, 1974, the
Principal of a west London
college sent a memo to all its
Heads of Department. It must
have read as follows:
'To all Heads of Department:
As of Ist October 1974 all
postgraduate students of this
college forfeit their civil rights
and should be treated as
second-class citizens.
This adjustment should be
carried out as follows:
1) A l the discretion of all
academic and non-academic
members of staff, postgraduates
can be refused the use of all
facilities in your Department.
You are therefore urged to
inhibit their progress as much
as possible.
2) No further maintenance
should be carried out in rooms
used solely by postgraduates.
3) Demonstrating done by
postgraduates should be
phased out as quickly as
possible. Their places are to
be taken by members of staff
and postdoctoral fellows.
Signed,
The Principal'
Reports from PG's of this
college suggest that these
measures are already being
enforced to an extent that their
lives are becoming intolerable.
An NUS spokesman when
informed of the above memo
replied 'Postgraduates
what are they?'.
A PG student from the
college, when asked to
comment, said 'We're sick and
tired of this! I wish I'd never
come here and anyway,
soon, no student will want to
come here to do research!'.
Yours faithfully,
'A PG by any
Other Name'.
The Reply
Imperial College Union.
28th October, 1974.
Dear Sir,
I feel I should reply to
Miss Jones' letter printed in
Felix last week.
It concerns me that Miss
Jones seems to think that CCU
business is 'petty'. I also
wonder how she can claim that
I am "an 'active' member of
RCS'' when I have done nothing
actively for RCSU other than
duties that my job demands,
which I have done for the
CCU's also.
There is very little else
that I feel needs to be said in
reply to the totally unfounded
letter.
Yours faithfully,
J.A. Gerrard,
ICU Hon. Sec.
