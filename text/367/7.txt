THURSDAY 24th October, saw the annual indulgent
spectacle of Imperial College's Commemoration Day per-
functorily characterised by its intimate mixture of solemnity,
grandeur, gaudy colour and questionable rhetoric.
Imagine hordes of in-
dividuals performing
Brownian motion in their
graduation robes, aping
Batman, outside the Royal
Albert Hall; the incumbent
families, cameras clicking,
in awe of their freshly
groomed offspring, 'Ooh,
don't 'e look nice?'; the
inter-graduate nostalgia,
back-slapping, 'How goes
it?', plus the nauseating
'Did your hair have an
argument with a lawn-
mower, Mike?'. (Originality
indeed).
The activities for the
afternoon started punctually
at 2.30p.m. with the pro-
cession of student officers,
college and Governing body
personalities' including the
new Honorary Associates
and Fellows with Lord
Sherfield making his final
appearance as Chairman of
the Board of Governors.
The presentation of the
graduates took place very
smoothly. The ritual is that
the Student Orator announces
"The Associates of . . . (the
appropriate constituent col-
lege)"; then the Dean of
the particular college steps
forward, makes a prelimin-
ary introduction with refere-
nce to the number of
Associates to have passed
their finals; he then proceeds
to present each Associate to
the Chairman of the Govern-
ing Body. After the
Associates came the DIC's
(Diploma of membership of
the Imperial College) who
were presented by the Pro-
Rector.
The actual presentation
ceremony itself is a very
simple matter: After one's
name has been called, one
walks out onto the stage,

turns, nods to the Chairman
(who reciprocates) and re-
tires stage right. It is all
over with quite painlessly
in a matter of seconds.
In addition to the
Associates and DIC's being
presented, there were, after
the Rector's speech, two
Honorary Associates (both
retiring members of the
College's technical staff)
presented also and five new
Fellows including the re-
tiring Principal of the
University of London, Sir
Douglas Logan; the newly-
appointed Chairman of the
Governing Body, Sir Henry
Fisher; and this year's
Special Visitor Dr. Ralf
Dahrendorf, the newly-
appointed Director of that
"dangerous left-wing estab-
lishment' ' the London School
of Economics.
The Rector's speech this
year was typically factual
and to the point. He produced
a record of his experiences
during the year, broached the
subject of how the difficul-
ties facing students in
London may be partly
responsible for the falling
intake of numbers, outlined
the College's serious
financial troubles and then,
after a brief nostalgic sortie,
expressed his optimism for
the future of the academic
activities which have recen-
ly been initiated including
the new department of Life
Sciences.
The Rector finished off
by paying tribute to the
retiring Chairman, Lord
Sherfield, who has held the
post for twelve years (having
succeeded Vis count Falmouth
who died in office).
The highlight of the
proceedings came with this
year's special visitor, arch-
European Dr. Ralf Dahren-
dorf, whose recent app-
ointment as Director of LSE
caused a major stir in the
Students' Union of that
establishment for it was
asserted that whilst on the
one hand, the authorities
were telling the students
that their Union grant would
remain at its painfully

inadequate level of approx-
imately £5 per capita (ICU's
grant is nearly three times
that amount), on the other
hand they appeared to be
lashing out money on their
new director for major
structural improvements on
his new-acquired flat.
Dr. Dahrendorf gave a
typically pro-Europe speech
outlining the major problems
facing this country. It was
never in doubt as to what
his solution to these diff-
iculties would be: 'We need,
in order to solve our survival
problems, rules and
procedures, organisations
and institutions which
transcend our national
boundaries'.
Although mentioning that
he did not wish to make any
'irresponsibly partisan'
statements as regards
Europe, one can only feel
that he must have exper-
ienced great difficulty in
adhering to such a premise.
Remarks made concerning
the student body in general
may be significant: '..there
is a sense in which student
power is not power,
community politics is not
politics, and national
revolutions do not change
one iota of the problems
determining our lives', and
finally, on the subject of
our problems, '...we are not
going to solve them if we
despair and embrace
extremist solutions. What
we need ....is nerves and
good sense. I cannot help
adding that I sometimes
wonder whether our univ-
ersities ...do enough to
instil this attitude in their
students'.
With all the speeches,
presentations and nodding
over, Commemoration Day
drew to a close barring the
after-ceremony tea.
The last minute comment
heard repeatedly was
'Where was Sir Brian's
collar and tie?'.
