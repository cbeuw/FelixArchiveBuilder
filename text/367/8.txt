AFFAIRS
CORNER
Tom Abraham
THE RESPONSE to the last
PiG Affairs Corner has been
pathetic, partly because the
article itself was rather insipid,
and partly because post-
graduates are too busy working
for that degree which is their
passport to the academic
elite. The singlemindedness
with which research work is
pursued means that other
related issues are totally
ignored.
Too many students are
working on projects which are
of little intrinsic value or
social benefit. Since elitism
is the prime motivation, to
question the value of the
project would be unthinkable.
To place all the blame on the
students would be unfair,
since they seem to be caught
up in a conspiracy of silence,
which militates against
honesty with regard to the true
nature of projects. On too
many occasions students have
soldiered on with such projects
spurred on by the vision of a
doctoral paradise.
In the face of a deepening
national economic crisis, one
must ask whether the research
work being carried out is
justifiable. More important,
whether the unrestricted
expansion of postgraduate
numbers is really warranted.
The main effect of the latter
is to produce a pool of highly
qualified but unemployable
graduates. This is especially
true at a time of rising un-
employment. A side effect of
the increase in numbers, is
that the facilities offered at
this college are insufficient,
and in some departments the
situation has reached crisis
point.
I feel that it is essential
for students to discuss among
themselves the philosophy
underling research work. As
well as this, the system of
research on which postgraduate
work is structured is in need
of drastic reform. Any i ni tiati ve
for change, will have to come
from us. To discuss this and
other issues a special meeting
of the Postgraduate Group will
be held sometime in November—
we hope to publicise it as
widely as possible (anybody
who disagrees violently with
•what has been written is free
to come along and propose a
censure motion).
To my darling Rose, I am
sorry about the lack of social
events for postgraduates. The
solution to this lies at the
departmental or sectional level.
The Postgraduate Group will
be organising social events on
a college wide basis, but these
will mainly be held when the
undergraduates are away.
However, if in the meantime,
if any departmental or sectional
group wishes to organise a
social, then ICPGG will
subsidise it. If it is money
you want, then get in touch
with either John Porter
(ext 4052) or me (ext 3103).
The Management Science
section have managed to get a
group together and are
organising socials with money
from the Group. I hope others
wili follow this shining
example.
ICWA General Meeting.

judging of the Mr. ICWA
competition and election

come for the voting.

On seeing Kevin Gately dead,
I think George Orwell would have said:
"If Nineteen Eighty-Four extends
To start the decade like it ends,
Are 'accidents' of such distress
More equal than an honest guess?"
On seeing Kevin Gately dead,
I think George Orwell would have said:
"What force was used within the square
To cause a student's dying there?
Can Britain proudly say 'GB'
Without the echo 'KGB'?"

FEW PEOPLE are better qualified to speak on crime, and
punishment than Lord Longford. He is not only a theorist on the
subject, about which he has written several books, but also
someone who has tried to do something practical. He was chair-
man of the Labour Party Committee on Penal Reform before the
1964 election, and it was
this committee that re-
commended the introduction
of parole. He is further
qualified in that for many
years he has visited people
in prison, and has seen the
effect prison has had on
them.
He introduced the subject
by outlining the reasons
for prisons. Firstly there is
the aspect of deterrent,
which is necessary to
maintain law and order.
Secondly there is reform,
but although 75% of ex-
prisoners do not return to
gaol, he thought prison
ineffective in this respect.
Then there, is the protection
of society from dangerous
criminals, and retribution
for the crime. There is also,
in some places, an idea of
reparation to society, but
this is rare in England.
Lord Longford said that
many people in gaol should
not be there, but are only
there because of lack of
alternatives, and hesuggested
that highly supervised work
for the community as one
alternative. The reduction in
the number of prisoners
would reduce the over-
crowding in prisons, relieving
the burden on the staff, and
so relaxing the atmosphere
in prison, which would
greatly facilitate the reform
of the inmates.
He said that ten years in
prison is enough to expiate
any crime, and that life
imprisonment was a hangover
from the days of capitol
punishment. Those who
needed confinement for longer
periods should be treated as
mental cases.
One great improvement
in the prison system, is
parole, which prisoners can
apply for after a third of
their sentence. At the moment
this is being somewhat abused,
for if there is no reform
after ten years, another year
or two inside does not do
any good.
For the future he hopes
to see the expansion of the
probation service to help
released prisoners. Many
of those released can only
§et manual work, and it is
ifficult to get any work of
a higher grade.
