FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION F R E E !
No. 367 FRIDAY, 1st NOVEMBER, 1974.
WRANGLE!
LAST MONDAY night at the ICU Council, a technical wrangle
was initiated by a member of the ICU Executive in an attempt
to delay the sending of a letter by the President to the Rector
on behalf of Council.
The original motion which
started it all was proposed by
the President to the effect
that he should D R A F T a letter
to the Rector expressing
concern and protest about the
fact that Imperial College
appear to be about to buy a
computer from ICL, a company
who apparently have business
connections with the South
African Government. The
spirit of the council was that
the letter should be sent, but
the motion had said merely
'draft'. John Mortimer, Pres-
ident of RSMU, later asked for
an assurance that the letter
would simply be drafted and
not sent. This caused uproar
and no such assurance was
given after the President had
realised he had incorrectly
drafted his motion.
Footnote: The letter was
drafted and sent to the Rector.
The recommendations went
through the College Board of
Studies and it appears that the
Rector has, indeed, taken
notice of the Union's protest.
ACCUSATION AT
LEEDS POLY.
THE FORMER Union Treasurer of Leeds Polytechnic, Robert
'Buzz' Windley, has been charged with stealing £28, £27 and
£48 belonging to the Poly Union on July 16th and 30th, dis-
honestly obtaining a pecuniary advantage in relation to a debt for
which he was liable by tendering two worthless cheques, one for
£3,346 and the other for £94, and taking a minibus without the
owner's consent.
Windley was arrested at
Ramsgate on October 10th on
his return from the Continent,
where he had been touring in
the minibus in the case. An
examination of the Union's
accounts on July 11th revealed
a large number of cheques
marked 'Return to Drawer'
were outstanding in his name.
He was told no more would be
cashed but between then and
STUDENTS AT SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY are holding
refectory boycotts and a partial rent strike after increases of
between 20% and 37% in refectory prices together with increases
in hall fees.
A well attended Union
meeting on Thursday 17th,
October, voted almost un-
animously for a campaign of
Refectory boycotts and a Rent
Strike. This follows the
aformentioned refectory price
increases and increases in
fees of certain halls. These
are the halls which supply
meals 'all in'. However, it is
expected that the fees of other
halls will be raised at the
start of next term.
The original motion before
the meeting, proposed by the
International Socialists, called
for a Rent Strike, selective
refectory boycotts, an oc-
cupation of University premises
(being progressively stepped
up until demands were met by
the University), and a with-
drawal from all negotiations
and all University committees
on which the Union is
represented. The meeting,
however, passed a much less
strongly worded amendment
which called for refectory
boycotts and a Rent Strike.
The Rent Strike Fund's
constitution was amended to
provide for students to pay to
the Union the total of the hall
fees bill received from the
University and for the Union
to then transfer to the
University the proportion
equivalent to hall fees for the
1973/74 session, retaining the
difference in the Strike Fund.
A refusal to allow any decline
in hall standards, support for
hall JCRs in attempts to
improve standards and a
guarantee that no college
staff would be made redundant
were also called for.
A successful refectory
boycott was carried out on
Tuesday — alternative meals
being provided by the Union.
The Hon. Sec. of Southampton
Union said: 'Although thje Rent
Strike has not started yet,
preliminary reactions are
favourable, in one of our most
conservative halls over 25%
of residents have stated they
will definately support the
Rent Strike'.
July 31st, cashed cheques
for the amounts in the charges.
He then left for France and
did not return to his post of
Vice-President for Admin-
istration when the Poly term
started on October 2nd. He
was then reported to the police.
Windley was released on
£1,500 bail on October 11th.
He later said that he would
return to his post of Vice-
President for Administration,
but was immediately banned
from the Poly Union. The
President of the Union also
threatened to resign if Windley
came back. Several people
were alarmed by the sympathy
which had been shown towards
Windley since his return to
Leeds. Deputy President of
the Union Ted Boyce said:
'It would be a disaster if he
did not resign even if he was
innocent.' Besides the criminal
charges against him he has not
acted as a union official
should do. I think he should
resign because of his actions
last year'.
Windley claims he left for
the Continent believing his
debts had been cleared
(the £3,346 cheque bounced).
7 would have returned to
Britain sooner and sorted
things out had I known what
was going on', he added.
At an SGM on Thursday
October 24th, Windley was
given a fair hearing to try and
clear his name. However, the
meeting went against him and
voted for his resignation —
which he is now bound by the
constitution to give.
No further comment was
available from Leeds today,
where the matter is considered
subjudice.
