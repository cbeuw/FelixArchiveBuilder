CONCERTS R i c h a r d W a r i n g
Wishbone Ash 4- Upp, at the Rainbow.
WHEN Ted Turner left Wishbone Ash
a couple of months ago, he said it was
because 'we had gone about as far as we
could go'. I agree with him.
The support band at the Rainbow
was Upp: a bass player, a drummer and
a vocalist/keyboards player. They were
quite 'different' but the first two were
unexciting, and as for the third! The
vocals grated horribly and some very
odd noises came out of the organ and
synthesisers (I'm not sure how many
were deliberate). To cap it all the guy
seemed to think he was a sweet singing
Keith Emerson.
There was a long delay between acts,
nothing seemed to happen after the
stage had been rearranged. Eventually
Wishbone Ash came on stage to a rousing
welcome (part sarcastic?) and launched
straight into the first number: a track
from their forthcoming album 'There's
the Rub'. Andy Powell then introduced
the new member of the group: Laurie
Wisefield ex of Home. Two more new
numbers followed.
The next announcement of '/ think its
time to play some old songs' was greeted
by wild enthusiasm. The band then
launched into 'The King Will Come',
'Warrior', and 'Throw Down the Sword':
all from their award winning third album
'Argus'. These came off quite well
despite the fact that the group has lost
a lot of its coherency of playing (a
certain lack of clarity in the instrumental
sections was evident). After another new
number, Steve Upton (the band's drummer)
wandered around on the front of the
stage and introduced the long instrumental
from the new album which was called,
believe it or not, 'FUBB'. This, he
informed us, stood for 'F*"*d Up
Beyonjd Belief — I can quite believe it.
'Blowin' Free' and 'Time Was' from
Argus closed the show. For the first
encore the band played 'Home Town' and
'No Easy Road'. The last number of the
night was 'Where Were You Tommorrow?'
from their second album 'Pilgrimage'.
To sum up, time and changes have
made it impossible for Wishbone Ash to
maintain the standards of tightness of
playing and excellence of tunes they
once had. They now, while stiM above
average, are a much more ordinary band
than of old. I personally dislike the
change of direction towards rock 'n roll,
and miss what I see as a continuity
of theme in parts of their first three
albums.

First let's mention the
support. A group called
ORANGE not yet peeled it
would seem. A fair amount of
talent and did the job that they
were there for and that was to
warm the audience to music.
But who needs warming to
OSIBISA!
Just as their name suggests
they come especially to make
music. Coming on stage in
what is now a traditional
parade, drums beating in
rhythmic eloquence, they went
straight into a warm up from
which developed a musical
interpretation of the African
Jungle called 'Deep in Africa'.
This included much intricate
keyboard work from KIKI GYAN.
Next the group decided to hit
the audience and launched
into what is probably the best
Osibisa single ever; 'Music
from a Gong Gong' (1st Album).
This track highlights the
versatility of each individual
with the group each con-
tributing to the whole sound.
The congas of Kofi AYIVOR
being prominent and filling the
audience with basic primitive
rhythmn. Featuring prominently
throughout the proceedings
are the leader TEDDY OSEI
on sax and his brother MAC
TONTOM on trumpet. A medley
of tracks starting with their
new single 'Whose got the
Paper, I've got the Mouse?'
followed. This particular track
was probably the worst music
played all night but presumably
they have to plug sales.
Following that were two
tracks from Superfly. The
first being 'Superfly Man'
featuring some excellent
rhythms with up to six of the
group playing percussion.
A sad lament called 'Why'
with some brilliant guitar from
PAUL GOLLY broke suddenly
into a climax causing many
people to leave their seats
with fits of movement. By now
the audience were well into
the music and great cries of
accompaniment could be
heard from every point.
From a very unusual lead-
in on bass by JEAN MANDEGUE
the next track kept many
people on their feet. Called
'Osibirock' from their new
album, it included the whole
group producing an incredible
beat from four sets of per-
cussion, keyboards, and
guitar. The percussion being
blended around SOL AMORFIO
who skips between the drum-
kit and his beloved congas.
As always Osibisa enjoy
audience participation and thus
included 'Kileli' receiving the
appropriate yells in reply from
the crowded hall. Not wasting
time TEDDY took the group
straight into a number called
'Fire' which has an except-
ionally beaty sound containing
a groovy bass guitar solo. With
the usual yelps and shouts
TEDDY did the Osibisa chant
and they were into 'Aiko Bee
Ai Ay' (1st Album).
To tumultuous applause and
the chanting of OSI - BISA
the group reappeared to give
yet another 30 minutes of
continuous encore. The spec-
tacle of seeing thrs group
perform was not to be missed
and if further performances are
as good as this one, you'll
have had your money's worth.
Highly entertaining to the
point of brilliance.

David Watson: My God is Real
(Falcon).
THE TITLE of this book sums up
fairly well what it is all about; in it
David Watson expands on the theme that
his God is real. In the first half of the
book he presents the truth of Christianity
mainly in an apologetic manner, first
examining the historical Jesus and
arguing in a compelling way for the
Christian exploration of this unique
person. He 'then spends three chapters
talking about traditional Christian ideas
like sin, hell and the cross in a way
that is easy to understand — you won't
need to be referring constantly to a
dictionary of theological jargan as you
read it.
The hinge of the whole book is the
chapter on the resurrection in which the
author argues forcefully for the Christian
explanation of what happened, i.e. that
Christ did rise physically from the dead.
This leads on naturally to the second
half of the book in which he does an
extraordinary thing: he starts being
practical about Christianity (What next
I ask?) He talks about what it really
costs and means to commit yourself to
living a real christian life, following a
real Christ.
This book, besides being very
readable, presents Jesus Christ and his
truth in a clear and no nonsense manner,
and I would recommend it to anyone who
wants to examine the Christian point of
view.
'My God is Real' will be on saleon
Christian Union bookstalls around
college from 28th October until 1st
November.
