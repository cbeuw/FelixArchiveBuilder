IC V UC
After chasing around the
tubes and streets of London,
IC 1st XI just managed to
catch the UC coach that was
to take them out to the wilds
of Hertfordshire. From the
start IC were on the attack but
unfortunately did not have the
ability (or luck) to add that
final touch to many well worked
moves. The inevitable goal
came from a Bob Middleton
short corner shot. UC, although
somewhat subdued and muddled
in defence, looked dangerous
on the break and it was from
one of these that their equaliser
came.
In the second half more
pressure was mounted by IC
and what proved to be the
winning goal came from a
cunning short corner deflection
by Trevor 'Superstar' Tutu.
Soon after Mr. Clarke missed a
penalty kick leaving the final
score 2-1, although a certain
left winger who shall remain
nameless, although his real
name is Jay Bashar, thought
we had drawn 1-1 (zzzzz!).
Team: R.Hulson, J.Marshall,
C. Hodge, K. Arrowsmith,
T.Clarke, T.Hanson (Capt.),
D. Lord, T.Tutu, R.Middleton,
J.Andrews, J.Bashar.

On Wednesday 23rd October,
the IC Ladies Hockey Team
sallied forth for their first
league match, vs King's
College. The nine members
fjjtaying tried hard against the
fierce opposition. We seemed
evenly matched until half-way
through the first half, when a
hard ball, destined to miss the
goal, was unfortunately
deflected by an IC stick into
her home goal. The question
of her resignation is not under
review.
Havin g chomped our oranges,
we began the second half bent
on revenge. Consequently,
King's scored on their own
within a few minutes. Webegan
to redress the balance with a
goal scored by Janet, but
after a series of corners, an
accurate shot from King's sped
through our defence. (Fluke).
IC broke free several times,
but never succeeded in scoring
again.
The result, 3-1 to King's
was disappointing, buthopefully
they are our strongest opp-
osition in the ULU League.
We are desperately short of
players — especially a goal-
keeper (who could have saved
all those goals). Many thanks
to all who played and remember
'If atfirstyoudon'tsucceed....'.
Team: Sarah Horn, Diana
Mounsey, Janet Coxage, Aviole
Timpson, Maureen King,
Jane Purvis, Jane Gwynne,
Lynne McLardie, Shirley
Fairweather and umpire
Jan Mellors.

IC V SURBITON
With an immaculate team of eight men, three veterans and five
novices, IC's 3rd team were already set to go at 1.15 p.m. At
3 o'clock the coach turned up — yawn! After this encouraging
start we commenced battle with the opposition, nine men against
eight, with one of their men as referee. Surbiton were working
well, and were soon '1-0' up -
gloom! But this was not to
last long as the 'intrepid
footballer*', one of our five
novices, scored a beautiful
goal to equalise. This was
followed by another good goal
by Andy Hall, from a short
corner. '2-1* up — hooray!
The second half saw a bit
of team rearrangement, due
to the appearance of three
members of the IC 2nd XI.
Most of the second half was
hence played with ten
'Surbitons' to our nine, and
two umpires courtesy of IC.
After a bad patch, we found
ourselves '3-2' down — gloom
again! But never fear, yours
truly, alias 'cuddly Captain
Ken', scored from a short
comer to give the final result,
'3-3'.

come again. Give up football
(football? What's that? - must
be a cissy game) and see the
world with IC Hockey!
MIXED
floaty
On Sunday the IC 'Mixed'
Hockey side played the Royal
School of Pharmacy at
Harlington. The sides were
balanced (even though we.
were missing two players)
the result fair and the match
enjoved by all. The score -*
one 'all (1-1).
The initial foulweather did
nor put off ferocious Shirley
Fairweather whose excellent
and solid defensive play was
ably supported by cool, calm
and collected John Huckle
and the panoplied Nigel
Harrison. Chris Hodge, playing
in a vague mid-field position
was not on peak form but
played capably. The perennial
John Andrews 'budded' on
several occasions with good
ruris through the opposition
defence and 'flowered' once
with an excellent reverse-
stick goal. The verbacious
Dave Lord on the right wing,
the photogenic Janet Coxage
and the extra-lemniscal Sarah
Horn all played well. The
confrontation was arranged,
produced and directed by
Mr. David Balderson and this
pseudo-prosaic report written
by Mr. A. Obscure.
B O A T C 1 U B
The Boat Club entered six
crews in the annual Head of
the River Race For Fours last
Saturday amongst a total entry
of about 250 boats. The race
was from Chiswick Steps to
Putney Pier — a distance of
2
% miles.
Apart from the Lubrication
Lab Four, doing well and
approaching the event with
slight contempt and non-
chalance, everybody had a poor
race — dropping below starting
positions. The race was
fairly uneventful although
crew IV, while taking the
IBIS second crew ('The men
from the Pru'), were treated
to the spectacle of them
driving their coseless four
under a string of anchored
barges at full bore. (Mike Hill
denies all responsibility).
Lub. Lab All Stars: Neil
James, Pete Summers, Andy
Bayles and Tim Crookes, came
equal fourth with UL Firsts
with a time of 12.06. IC Boat
Club best crew finished 36th,
times were as follows: —
II Bill Swift, John Bland,
Nigel _Gillet, Simon Barker:
12.49.
III Steve Maw, John Ludwig,
John Fitzgerald, R. Wilson:
13.44.
IV Mike Hill, Rich Tomlins,
Nigel Philpott, John Holding:
13.32.
V Cox-Andy Dyson, Martin
Jones, Willy White, Tony
Lancaster, Francis Ellis:

Walker, Gordon Bale, Stuart
