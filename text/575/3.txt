at 12:30pm for 1:15pm start, for a
bible study on Romans. W e meet
at 16K Petersham Place, and you
are welcome to come. Every man
has the right to know the way
G o d has prepared for man, i.e.
Salvation through H i s Son Jesus
Christ — who Himself said " I a m
the way, the truth and the life, no
man comes to the Father, but by
me."
O n a purely practical note —
who in their right m i n d would
make a joke out of a condemned
man, which is what Jesus was
w h e n w e a r i n g his c r o w n of
thorns.
God so loved the world that He
gave his one and only Son that
whosoever believes in Him should
not perish but have eternal life.

Affiliation
Bombshell
T H E I C U E X E C U T I V E may
be liable to be sued if the U n i o n
becomes affiliated to the C a m -
paign for Nuclear Disarmament.
A motion was passed at the
end of the last term advocating
such affiliation, but M r Passmore
was advised by a student that by
paying money to such an organ-
i s a t i o n , he w o u l d be a c t i n g
beyond his legal powers. If that is
so, both himself, and the Execu-
tive, would be acting illegally,
and liable in court, if the matter
was taken that far. It is thought
that a precedent was set in this
matter in a 1972 court case when
a student successfully sued his
U n i o n .
M r Passmore has spoken to
M i c h a e l Arthur, U n i o n Welfare
Advisor, and is currently pursu-
ing the matter with the U n i o n
S o l i c i t o r . H e hopes that the
Solicitor's advice will be accepted
by U n i o n members.
U n t i l s u c h t i m e as he is
advised that such affiliation does
not constitute a breach of his
powers, M r Passmore will not
pay monies to any organisation.
M r Passmore pointed out that
U n i o n societies such as political
groups, c o u l d not use U n i o n
money to affilate to other poli-
tical parties or national groups.
A n y money for this would have
to be raised through subscrip-
tions.
Brewers
Droop
A R E A L A L E promotional night
w a s h e l d i n S t a n ' s B a r i n
Southside on Tuesday evening.
O n e thousand pints of T a y l o r
Walker Real Ale were on sale,
priced at 30p per pint. A large
number of people attended the
event, and Stan's was crowded
for most of the evening.
Some people have since criti-
cised the cheap beer, complain-
ing that it was very weak; " A s
weak as gnats' piddle," was how
one unhappy punter described it.
Rao Snee. Deputy President,
told F E L I X that she thought the
event had been worthwhile, as
those people (here had enjoyed it.
It meant that there were more
people in S t a n ' s t h a n u s u a l .
There was a barrel left at the end
of the evening, but she did not
agree this meant the real ale to be
umpopttlar even at the low price.
The Bar Committee would be
looking into having more eve-
nings, and contacting brewers to
I that end, she said.
College Wide Ballots
Imperial accused of "destroying ULU"
I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E U N I O N received a derogatory report in
London Student last week. T h e report, entitled " N o to C a m p u s W i d e
Ballot", was one of a debate at the University of L o n d o n U n i o n
Student Representative C o u n c i l , (although the article does not
mention this location). A motion to elect U L U ' s three sabbatical
officers by campus-wide ballot was rejected.
J o h n Passmore, I C U President, and proposer of the motion, d i d not
feel that the ninety person S R C could properly represent a university
of 48,000. H e thought the University-wide ballot would b ; more
democratic.
R i c h M c M a h o n of the Institute of Education is reported in London
Student as arguing that " I m p e r i a l [College U n i o n ] was not concerned
about democracy at all, but simply wanted a system which would
collapse, destroying U L U and helping to destoy all student unions".
T h e motion was defeated by fifty-four votes to thirty-seven.
M r Passmore told F E L I X that R i c h M c M a h o n , w h o m hi regarded
as a "Trotskyist" and a " r a v i n g politico" was laughed at by the S R C
meeting when he accused I C U of wanting to "destroy all student
unions". H e flatly denied that either he, or the U n i o n had such a wish.
A n n a Clarke, U L U President and opposer of the motion, told
F E L I X she realised having a cross-campus ballot would give larger
colleges, such as I C , a larger share of the vote, instead of one vote per
College as at present. This would favour a candidate from a larger
college who would be likely to be able to sway his own college to vote
for him.
FirstThe Last Waltz
T H E C & G U N I O N D i n n e r and Dance, held at the R o y a l G a r d e n
H o t e l , K e n s i n g t o n , last F r i d a y n i g h t , f i n i s h e d e a r l y , to the
disappointment of many people at the Dinner.
This was the first year that the event was held outside College. M a n y
of the guests assembled in Sloane's C o c k t a i l Bar in Knightsbridge
before going on to the H o t e l . T h e evening's procedings passed
p e a c e f u l l y , u n t i l S i m o n S h a w , G u i l d s E n t e r t a i n m e n t s O f f i c e r ,
announced at 1:00pm that the D a n c i n g would be cut short. After only
two records, the disco was stopped and the evening ended at 1:30am
on Saturday morning. The bar had closed an hour earlier than
expected, and the whole event was over one and a half hours sooner
than had been originally planned. T h e executive had known about the
early closure since the day before the event. They had been informed
that the police had withdrawn the Hotel's licence for holding late
funcitons, but they did not officially publicise this until near the end of
the evening. This caused some dissatisfaction amongst a number of
people, mainly because they were told of the early finish just two
dances before it occurred.
Dave Gayor, Guilds President, told F E L I X that he thought the
evening was better than could have been provided in College, but that
Guilds should think twice about so many people in Sloane's again,
which only served to cause confusion and delay (see letters' page).
The Navy Lark
L A S T T U E S D A Y evening an invited audience of two hundred
students and staff gathered in M e c h E n g 220 to hear a lecture by the
R o y a l N a v y Presentation T e a m , led by C a p t D a v i d Morse, on
Britain's maritime interests and the role and future of the R o y a l N a v y .
T h e purpose of the lecture, which is repeated round the country, was
to inform people why it is considered necessary to spend £3,050m a
year on the N a v y .
Capt Morse, backed up by films and slides, began by explaining that
Britain was dependent on the sea for economic and trading reasons,
since we are not self-sufficient, especially in food supplies.
Britain, currently spends jfl0.5billion a year on defence, but even
spending this huge amount, we could not defend ourselves alone
against attack, which is why we belong to the fifteen-member N A T O ,
contributing 55,000 troops to the defence of West G e r m a n y in any
war. T h e N a v y would in wartime come under N A T O command.
Industry benefited to the tune of £1,000m this year in N a v a l
business; this includes development of missiles, 'unjammable' radar,
and torpedoes.
S u m m i n g up, C a p t Morse said we face a continuing threat from the
Soviet U n i o n , who appear unwilling as yet to disarm, and this is one
reason for maintaining the N a v y .
