IC s t a r t e d w e l l a n d s o o n s h o w e d t h e i r
d o m i n a n c e , e s p e c i a l l y in the f o r w a r d s .
Continued pressure led to a fine try by fly-
half, H u g h e s - N a r b o r o u g h after a s c r u m
inside Roehampton's twenty-two metre line.
The try was converted.
IC then began to relax a little and allowed
Roehampton to get back into the game with a
penalty given away in front of the posts.
However, the driving play of the pack soon
led to a further score by O'Docherty on the
right wing after third phase possession had
been won. This was also well converted.
The second half showed the IC forwards to
be well in command in all phases of play. The
rolling maul was particularly effective against
an o p p o s i t i o n w h o t e n d e d to s t a n d off,
usually offside, and wait for the ball to be fed
to the IC backline. However, invariably any
moves would break down just before the
Roehampton try-line.
Roehampton scored a break-away try from
t h e i r o w n l i n e f o l l o w i n g a s p e c u l a t i v e
clearance into open space and very lucky
bounce of the ball.
IC countered with some very tight forward
play to ensure a 12-10 victory; something that
was worked hard for, but was never really in
any doubt from the kick-off.
T E A M : Chirpy Thrale, o'Docherty, Davies,
Wall, Spring, Hughes-Narborough, Slug, Bell,
Ball, Kirby, Bradley, Tool, Davies, Stear,
Chulkin.
Football Fourths
WITH a couple of changes the Fourths faced
up to Holloway who they had previously
beaten 7-2 earlier in the season. After a
scrappy start to the game by both sides IC fell
behind after ten minutes. This goal resulted in
a more positive approach from the Fourths
and they soon levelled the score when a
Burns shot found the corner of the net.
A second goal quickly followed when after
a good run Marlon rounded the opposing
goalkeeper and pushed the ball into the net.
Dolan increased the lead when after a good
through ball he hit a first time shot past the
advancing keeper.
Following a good save from Holloway's
keeper Burns scored again when his shot was
deflected into the net. Just before half-time
IC scored their fifth when, following a Marlon
shot, the ball seemed to be on the line, but
Graves tapped it into the net.
In the second half Holloway were under
constant pressure but a twenty yard shot
from Dolan was the only addition to the
score. IC were unlucky to see good attempts
saved on the line. At the back Hampton
playing on goal looked competant on the odd
occasion he touched the ball, and fullbacks
Maddy and Milner defended well and had
good runs up their wings.
T E A M : Hampton, Maddy, Milner, Chown,
Veats, Buckley, Graves, Dolan, McNicholas,
Burns, Marlon.
Hockey Firsts
I M P E R I A L ' S start to p r o b a b l y the most
important game of the season was disastrous.
K o d a k , m o v i n g the ball a r o u n d fluently,
applied all the pressure in the opening ten
minutes and gained a well deserved goal.
They continued to create problems for the rest
of the first half for Imperial who lacked any
sort of rhythm and it was only sure fire saves
by k e e p e r B u t l e r a n d c l e a r a n c e s f r o m
Coatsworth and Hughes that prevented a
worse half-time scoreline. Imperial fought
back in the second half 'and soon after a
missed penalty flick by Clarke Bell slotted
home a neat cross. With only two minutes to
go Cope netted the ball after a scramble at
the top of the 'D' to place Imperial firmly at
the the top of the league.
T E A M : Butler, Coatsworth, Davey, Gatley,
Rich, Bell, Franklin, Hughes, Riley, Clarke

THIS was our first league game this term, and
a good result was necessary to keep our
league position respectable, and to restore
team m o r a l e after several d i s a p p o i n t i n g
results.
From the start it was clear that IC were a
much better side than E T E S S A and it was
only an effective off-side trap w h i c h our
attack repeatedly fell for, that prevented us
scoring early in the match. IC controlled the
midfield, and it was only a matter of time
before Chew, fresh from his 'short' Christmas
break in Malaya, opened the scoring. This
was f o l l o w e d s o o n after by a very g o o d
opportunist goal by Whittaker, which took
us to half-time with a 2-0 lead. One of the
umpires however had other ideas. The boots
of some of our players were deemed illegal
since they had metal studs, and to avoid
p l a y i n g the s e c o n d half with a g r o u p of
b a r e f o o t e d p l a y e r s , the s i d e fiad to be
reshuffled so that the 'culprits' played on the
opposite side of the field to this umpire. A s a
result the second half became scrappy and
despite this IC held on to win their first match
this term, and thus earn two valuable points.

L A S T S A T U R D A Y the Bowling Club sent
three teams to the Brunei Handicap Tourna-
ment.
Knight and Ng finished their six games with
a score of 1966.
Lau and M a c G o w a n started excellently
when M a c G o w a n bowled a 234 to take high
handicap game. With a 203 from Lau and a
2165 score over six games, they came third in
the scratch tournament.

defeating all opposition at Brent on Saturday.
In a v e r y l i g h t w i n d t h e y s h o w e d t h e i r
versatility by winning, in two races, their
fourth successive match. This time against
City University.
In the first race although the members of
the team sailed well, the team as a whole
sailed badly. Kennedy Gate started the race
and the situation then dictated that each
boat search for wind where it would. So
a l t h o u g h there were fights for i n d i v i d u a l
p l a c e s , most n o t a b l y by C h a d w i c k w h o
eventually finished first, little of the teams
new-found racing skill was displayed. The
result was IC first, third and fifth.
In the second race however the teams h i d a
better measure of the conditions and f i e i r
enthusiasm grew. The first heat resuifad in
one IC boat and all the City boats colliding at
the first mark and although the IC team could
possibly have held first, second and sixth, to
win, they returned to help Kennedy the sixth
man and after a nice peice of sailing just
before the finish by Mills finally finished
second, third and fourth to gain more useful
league points.
T E A M : Allport, Chadwick, Kennedy, Mills,

L A S T W E E K E N D the IC Swimming Team
went to Bristol University for the annual IC v
Bristol Gala.
The Women's Team was stronger than
previous years, Wilton (Captain) swimming
well to win the ladies breast stroke. The ladies
a l s o w o n both the m e d l e y a n d freestyle
relays.
The Men's Team did not do very well, even
though Heffeman won the backstroke, and
Boucher the individual medley, Nicholas Last
giving a good fight for second place.
Maybe the men were beaten in the relays as
they were s a v i n g their strength for the
following waterpolo match.

I would like to say thank you to David
Roberts who drove us to Bristol and back
again (in the fog) and put up with the noise

L A S T S U N D A Y saw the last Inter-University
League match of this academic year. The
match was played against Brunei, at the Airport
Bowl near Heathrow. Brunei have a strong
side and showing good form on the day beat
the Imperial side which showed good spirits
and although the A team did not bowl as well
as was expected the B, C and Ladies teams
fought well agianst superior opposition. The
Imperial stars were Knight and Quinn, from
the A and B teams respectively, who bowled
very respectable series. Thanks must also go
to Marker and Ellis who made up the C team
numbers, fortunately.
