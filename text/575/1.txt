Thursday's Union General Meeting was stopped after less
than half an hour, when the quorum was successfully
challenged by Stephen Goulder. As a result of the repeated
inquoracy of UGMs, Liz Lindsay is setting up a new working
party, which she hoped would contain Owen Greene, Steve
Goulder, William Cortazzi, and Mark Clegg, to investigate
methods of promoting the attendance at such meetings.
These pecple had complained about the Executive's
performance, and the running of the UGM at the meeting.
The meeting opened at 1:05pm to a less than half full Great H a l l .
After the minutes of the last meeting were accepted, O w e n Greene
moved that the order of business be changed to place the motion on
nuclear disarmament immediately after the President's report, so as he
and others could go to a nuclear lecutre that was also given last term.
T h i s was voted on, but as the result was close, a hand count was taken.
T h e results was 46-50 against the motion. The most controversial part
of the President's report concerned the U l t r a Vires issue (see page
three). M r Passmore explained that he would not affiliate I C U to any
organisation until he was informed by the U n i o n Solicitor that such
action was definitely not illegal. O w e n Greene said he should have
taken more action on the motions that were passed. H e argued that
there was hardly a students' union in the country that wasn't affiliated
to something or other.

L O R D F L O W E R S , Rector of Imperial College since 1973, has declared
his support for the Social Democratic faction in the current internal
wrangle in the L a b o u r Party. T h e " C o u n c i l for Social Democracy", in
a half-page advertisement in yesterday's Guardian, listed a selection of
one hundred people who had pledge their support to the C o u n c i l —
L o r d Flowers described merely as a "physicist", was included in the
list. A l t h o u g h L o r d Flowers hasn't studied any physics for some years
now, this is more accurate than that of the Guardian, which togged him
as a "sociologist".
T h e C o u n c i l for Social Democracy was founded with the L a b o u r
Party lay four right wing L a b o u r politicians (Dr D a v i d O w e n , M P ,
W i l l i a m Rogers, M P , Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins) following the
recent change in the way the L a b o u r party is elected. The changes,
which give trade unions and local L a b o u r party organisations a much
larger part in the vote, represent a strong swing to the left in the party
organisation. The announcement of this list of supporters comes amidst
growing speculation o n the possibility of a break by the Social
Democrats from the L a b o u r party and the setting up of a new party.
As well as L o r d Flowers, the list includes a variety of people, among
the trade union leaders, University lecturers, and the President o f
C a m b r i d g e Students' U n i o n .
meeting. L i z Lindsay said that they had publicised the meeting to the
same extent as previous meetings. W i l l i a m C o r t a z z i said the Exec were
elected to office to do a job, and he did not think they were doing it
properly if so few people turned out. M a r k Clegg suggested that posters
should be stuck in student houses in E v e l y n Gardens. L i z Lindsay
took this as a n offer to d o this, but M a r k C l e g g said she h a d
misunderstood him. After a proposal to move to next business, the
President's report was accepted.
Dare Afolabi then moved that the order of business should be
changed to have the motion on the Brandt Report (advocating greater
awareness of the findings) considered next. This was rejected on a vote.
The Deputy President, in her report, emphasised that the Beit T V
Lounge was not for use by the whole U n i o n . There was a U n i o n T V
Lounge in Southside next to Stan's Bar.
After her report was accepted, W i l l i a m C o r t a z z i moved that the E l
Salvador motion should be considered next, as it would be more
interesting. This proposal was defeated on a vote.
In the H o n See's report L i z Lindsay emphasised that she wanted
people to contact her with a view to writing a paper on 'Preparation
for Scientific or Technical Degrees'. Those interested should contact
her as soon as possible, she said.
W h e n the meeting moved to the returning officers report, Steve
Goulder said that he could not let an inquorate meeting elect a U n i o n
Officer. Therefore, he called quorum. It was obvious that not even 150
people were there, well less than the requisite 300 for a quorate
meeting, so the meeting was stopped.
Caroline Waitt, from Nightline had come tq_speak to the meeting,
so most of those at the meeting waited to hear what she had to say.
She said that Nightline would be moving to number nine Princes
Gardens from number ten over the Easter vacation. She emphasised
that Nightline was not a political, religious, or counselling service, but
was always willing to listen to those who wanted to talk to them —
about a n y t h i n g . N i g h t l i n e had an extensive i n f o r m a t i o n service
covering entertainment, in L o n d o n and other colleges, medical services
and most other things. She hoped people would buy tickets for the
Guilds Special Benefit concert, including bands and a disco to be held
on February 20.
After this, those still in the Great H a l l left, having been told to take
their rubbish with them.
L i z Lindsay issue a statement to F E L I X later. She said: " I a m
setting up a W o r k i n g Party to discuss the promotion of attendance at
U G M s . Those especially invited to attend are O w e n Greene, Steve
Goulder, W i l l i a m Cortazzi, and M a r k Clegg, as these people expressed
paricular concern about the poor attendance at today's meeting.
Anyone else is also more than welcome to attend. It is proposed to hold
the meeting at 12:45pm on M o n d a y , February 23 in my office."
She blamed the low attendance on exams and milk round interviews
going on at the time. She said last week's F E L I X had not helped, as it
suggested the meeting w o u l d be inquorate. A l t h o u g h she had asked
Steve M a r s h a l l to include an advertisement for the meeting he had not
done so. M r Marshall claimed it was he who pointed out to L i z
Lindsay that the date of the meeting should be changed.
He thought last week's article was good publicity for the meeting
and he'd make sure all F E L I X readers were aware that the next
U G M would be the Sabbatical Election Hustings M e e t i n g on M a r c h 5
in the Great H a l l at 1:00pm
