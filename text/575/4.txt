WIST
O N T H U R D A Y , F E B R U A R Y 12 CISSY, the
Campaign to Impede Sex Stereotyping in the
Young, will be speaking at a meeting of WIST and
anyone is welcome to attend.
Many childrens books and comics reinforce the
traditional roles society has expected males and
females to play and thus children are brainwashed
from a very early age into accepting these roles
without question.
Girls usually feature in lesser roles in stories
where boys take the main roles, usually as sisters
or inferior gang members. They often have
unpleasant traits such as crying a lot, fussing or
being very physically weak. Often they are
expected to do jobs such as cooking, washing and
cleaning. When a girl does play the main role in a
story they often have to overcome dreadful
obstacles such as blindness, illness, before they
get some reward such as fame or popularity.
These clearly put over the message that girls are
inferior.
The meeting on Thursday will be at 6:30pm in
the Green Committee Room. It will be in the form
of an informal discussion, and the speakers will be
bringing some examples of children's books along
with them.
BUN AC
M A N Y P E O P L E have been going on holiday in
America in the past couple of years, but did you
know that it is possible to work there as well, to
pay for it all? Unfortunately, the necessary
temporary work permits are not generally
available. However, one way to obtain one is
through the British Universities North America
Club.
B U N A C is a non-profit making national club
which organises an exchange program enabling
students at British universities — including,
overseas students — to work in the U S A and
Canada. B U N A C arranges members' work
permits, flights, insurance and the first night's
board in America. They also run an office in New
York to provide help to the participants, should
they need it.
Members have the choice of working of a kids'
summer camp, or of finding their own job
anywhere they like. Those who choose to work at
a camp have the further choice of whether to look
after the children (it helps if you are the outgoing
type), or working in the kitchen and maintenance
side. Those who choose to work on a camp have
everything arranged for them. However, those
members on the second scheme have to arrange
their own jobs themselves, although B U N A C
does publish its own exclusive job-directory to
help them. The idea of all the schemes is that
members should be able to break even overall if
they wish.
Interested? Then come and find out more
about the B U N A C work programs at one of our
w e e k l y i n f o r m a t i o n meetings on F r i d a y
lunchtimes in the Green Committee Room on the
third floor of the Union Building.
