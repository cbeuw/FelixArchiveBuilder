Dear Sir
T h e Phantom T y r e Slasher of
Southside is not the only person
disgruntled about the number of
non-permit holding cars around
S o u t h s i d e . D e s p i t e h a v i n g a
Southside permit, I a m often
unable to find a place at a l l , and
have to leave my car in 'illegal'
places on the m a i n campus, so
annoying the legal users there
too.
A quick survey today showed
over a dozen permit-less cars plus
two a b a n d o n e d vehicles that
have been there over six months.
W h y have these not been removed,
and where are the people with
the big stickers?

Dear Sir
W i t h reference to the recent
London Student cover story I feel
prompted to speak up for firms
recruiting graduates to work in
South Africa. W h i l e not neces-

" A n t i - A p a r t h e i d " since return-
i n g f r o m ten m o n t h s i n the
South African m i n i n g industry
a n d starting at I C . Let me say
that I do not pretend to be well
informed about South Africa's
internal affairs and I'm not so
naive that I believe there are no
injustices within the Republic,
i but is it fair to d i s c r i m i n a t e
against these f i r m s , especially
when some of them — certainly
those i n m i n i n g (e.g. U n i o n
Corporation) — are probably
leading the way in narrowing the
gaps between blacks' and whites'
s t a n d a r d s of l i v i n g . M y stay
abroad gave me an insight into
some South African policies in
t h e f i e l d o f r a c e r e l a t i o n s
Consequently it angers me and
d e s t r o y s m y f a i t h i n h u m a n

students, on reading such reports
in the media, will accept them on
face value. I ask that the editorial
board of lj>ndon Student restrict
their reporting to what actually
happened and leave out what I
see as propaganda. As for L S E
A n t i - A p a r t h e i d , I wish them
success in the good work they do,
but that they do not attempt to
interfere with students' bias. I
would like to believe that the
only reason most I C students
bank with Nat West is because
they have the most convenient
branch.
I think some of my colleagues
in R S M would agree with my
views. M a n y of them will work in
South Africa after graduating,

which I suggest is more than can
be said for members of the A n t i -

Dear Mr FELIX Editor
After an exhaustive feasibility
study over a period of four years,
we have finally discovered the
hidden meanings of the R o y a l
College of Science chant ' K a n -
gela'.
T h e translation of their loud
but nevertheless dischordant (sic)
and unrhymical (sic?) shouts, is
embedded in the history of the
old language of Fanakalo.
Fanakalo is a Southern African
(South Africa, +Zambia +Zim-
babwe) linqua franca which is a
bastardization of Z u l u , Xhosa,
Basotho, and English in order to
aid widespread communication
between numerous tribes.
' K a n g e l a A r m a d o l a ' i n
Fanakalo means ' E x a m i n e your
knee (or elbow) pads'. Therefore
we now understand the hidden
meanings which belie the R C S
U n i o n . T h e y o f c o u r s e f u l l y
realise their inferiority to the
other C C U ' s , namely R S M . and
thus the R C S executive need to
remind their students and most
i m p o r t a n t l y the new freshers,
that they must constantly inspect
their knee and elbow pads. This
w o u l d u n d o u b t e d l y p r e v e n t
callouses forming when bowing
down on their knees to the more
superior C C U s .
Thus, M r Editor, we rest our
case on the f o u n d a t i o n a n d
subsequent tradition of the R C S
U n i o n .
Yours sincerely

PS: F o r a n y d o u b t i n g R C S
student, the translation can be
proved by looking in an E n g -
lish/Fanakalo Dictionary.
Dear Steve
I would like to say a few words
about D & D . Firstly, I would like
to thank all those who worked so
hard to make the evening such a
success. Secondly I would like to
thank the R o y a l G a r d e n Hotel
for providing such an excellent
venue, and Barkers, Waitrose.
the O l d Centralians, Alans Bar.
The U n i o n Bar, Links, Chaps
and Elec E n g 4 for providing
raffle prizes.
I would also like to explain
why we had to finish early. The
day before the event we were
i n f o r m e d that the police h a d
withdrawn the late licence. Alter
lengthy negotiations, involving
solicitors, by three o'clock on
Friday we knew that w.e could
not legally remain in the Building
after 1:00am. We were not the
only victims: the R o y a l G a r d e n
H o t e l s t a f f p a r t y was a l s o
r e s t r i c t e d to a n 1 1 : 3 0 b a r
extension. N o one could have
been more disappointed about
this than us. but we did not
mention it publicly during the
dinner, in order to give the R o y a l
Garden a chance to give us some
leeway. This they did, letting us
continue the music until 1:30am
and leave by 2:00am.
W e are sorry if this in anyway
spoilt anyone's enjoyment ol the
evening. It was not as we would
have wanted, but everything that
could have been done was done.

Dear Sir
Last Friday was Guilds D & D .
In previous years this function
has c o n t i n u e d u n t i l a r o u n d
5:00am. W i t h the event being
held outside College there was
m u c h speculation as to what time
it would finish. T h e consenus of
o p i n i o n ( i n c l u d i n g the E x e c )
seemed to be that the bar would
close at 2:00am and we would
leave the hotel by 3:00am. A s it
t r a n s p i r e d the b a r c l o s e d at
1:00am and we were informed
that we had to be out by 1:30am.
W e feel that an announcement
should have been made before
the dinner or during the speeches,
to this effect, since Simon Shaw
knew about this on Thursday.
T h o s e w h o e x p r e s s e d t h e i r
discontent were harangued and
insulted by G u i l d s / L i n k s hacks,
as though Guilds were beyond
reproach. W e would also like to
point out that the cabaret seemed
more appropriate to C a r n i v a l
than D & D , and we don't con-
sider two records a disco, how
about a refund?
In conclusion we would like to
record that the " D i n n e r " and
service were excellent (Mooney
take note!!) but the evening was
tarnished by lack of insight in not
reorganising the entertainment.

Sir
I w r i t e i n response to the
p h o t o g r a p h a n d i n s c r i p t i o n
written in association for F E L I X ,
J a n u a r y 30, 1981. N o t only was
it a foolish display on the part of
the person who addressed himself
as J Christ, but it was utterly-
abhorrent to anyone who has
come to realise the sheer futility
of life apart from knowing Jesus
Christ as Saviour and L o r d . N o ,
there is no s e n t i m e n t a l i t y at-
tached to the fact that we are all
sinners in God's sight, and that
all of m a n k i n d desparately needs
s a v i n g f r o m t h e s i n w h i c h
readily, and consistently perverts
a m a n (or woman's) life.
Religious nonsense you may
say, but the fact is that m a n is not
as his Creator intended h i m , and
is now rotten to the core, full of
a l l those t h i n g s r e c o r d e d i n
Romans C h a p t e r 1 v 18-32. T h e
p i c t u r e g i v e n by this passage
f r o m t h e B i b l e r i n g s t r u e ,
especially today. H o w amazing
that you and your readers —
intellectual people, can look for
fulfillment in so many ways, and
miss the one p a t h w a y w h i c h
leads to abundant life, and all other
roads lead to death. Indeed, man
is already dead, and will only
find life in Jesus Christ. It is
conceivable that this does not
interest you — fair enough, you
have made your choice, but I feel
bound to warn you that if you
blaspheme the name of Jesus
Christ, you are likely to receive
punishment both i n this life and
the next. If you choose to shut
your eyes to the facts, you have
made your decision — but don't
complain that you did not have
any idea of what you were doing.
