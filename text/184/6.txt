If you divide the population into two groups—those
who take T H E TIMES and those who don't—you find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are in the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top in their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority in experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you
place yourself?

will be very welcome.
P R O G R A M M E

May Ball.
Crowning of the Carnival
Queen.

Princes Gardens.
Help will be needed to organise
all these activities—YOUR help.
More details from the Carnival
Office.
CAROL SINGING
Carnival activities have in fact
already begun, with Carol singing
at the end of last term. The
weather was unfortunately all too
seasonable, with the result that
only £180 was raised, a con-
siderable drop on last year's
figure. Despite this disappointing
start, however, we are determined
to improve on last year's Carnival
total. This we can certainly do
—WITH YOUR HELP. S o -
come along to the Carnival
Office. You'll be very welcome.
Stynx
No, it's not a comment on
world affairs, nor is it a subject
studies by white-coated denizens
of the R.C.S. Building ; it's the
name of the I.C. Carnival Maga-
zine. The Editor would be pleased
to receive jokes, cartoons and
humorous stories of almost all
kinds. Last year's Stynx, if you
can get hold of a Copy, will give
you some idea of the kind of
thing required, but in any case
remember—IF IT M A K E S YOU
L A U G H , T E L L IT TO STYNX!
Carnival Queen
WE WANT GIRLS ! ! !
Yes, we know that there's a
shortage at I.C., but all we want
are PHOTOGRAPHS, and a
200-word profile of the girl YOU
think ought to be this year's-
C A R N I V A L QUEEN. So, gen.
tlemen, it's up to you ! send yonr
nominations to Graham B. White
(Mr. I.C.W.A.), at the CAR-
N I V A L OFFICE. We hope to
introduce to you a couple of
contending beauties in each edi-
tion of FELIX.

H O G M A N Y IN T H E
HIGHLANDS
It was the crack of noon as we
left Fort William on December
31st, 1962. We fought our way
through the teeth of the blizzard
up the final snow field. Intrepid
and undaunted, we emerged vic-
torious on the plateau of Ben
Nevis. The moon was rising high
over the distant lights of the
Clachaig Hotel. Only two hours
to opening time, an incentive to
drive on even the most exhausted.
We rushed headlong (literally)
down the snow slopes to the tan-
talising lights. It was about two-
thirds of the way down, where
the gradient began to ease, that
one' memDer of the party decided
to take a faster route to the inn.
He disappeared down a stream
of ice and was found—muttering
quietly—some hundreds of feet
below. As the delirium was wear-
ing off, he realised that time was
running out. Leaping to his feet
he promptly fell another fifty
yards and, unruffled, set off in
pursuit of the rest of the party.
It was nine o'clock when we
reached the car. Tensed for
the approaching festivities, we
eagerly pulled the starter.
Nothing.
" Did you turn the ignition
key ?"
" Yes!"
" Have a look under the bon-
net !"
Silence.
" M y God, we forgot to hang
the Davy lamp in the engine !"
The dread truth dawned, the
engine frozen and there we were
twenty-five miles from the Cla-
chaig.
As the old year ended we sat,
huddled, shivering in the gloom,
sipping vodka from a thimble. A
quarter of a bottle of vodka for
four people ! The worst part of
the holiday was yet to come.
Later we heard of the free whis-
key which flowed in the Clachaig
that night.
Hogmany in the Highlands ?
Never again!
