valuable contribution to their re-
spective problems. But it must
be remembered that these were
student opinions and were pre-
sented as such without any pre-
tensions. Also it may be noted
that the authors of these docu-
ments, members of N.U.S. execu-
tive committee, went to almost
inordinate lengths to obtain the
"Opinions of constituent organisa-
tions. These were not the state-
ments of one or two people but
inasmuch as this was possible,
the combined expressions of more
than one hundred and sixty
thousand students.
In the field of student welfare
N.U.S. holds an enviable inter-
national reputation for its work.
This work, generated by a con-
stitutional obligation to represent
students as such, has been and is
being successfully developed. Its
recent evidence to the Standing
Advisory Committee on Grants
to Students was described to me
quite voluntarily by a member of
the Committee as a most reason-
able and accurate document.
How many of the students at l.C.
had increases in their grants this
year ? Other than money it is
concerned with student health and
the experiences of Colleges with
medical arrangements is valuable
in assessing fust what kind of
health service is required in many
places where such provision is
rudimentary or non-existent. Its
recent pamphlet on the Students'
Guide to Insurance Stamp Col-
lecting lucidly expounds the pit-
falls of National Insurance and
ways of overcoming them. Case
work too finds its place. Often
the pressure that N.U.S. has been
able to bear on Local Education
Authorities to reconsider their
attitudes to individuals has meant
that many students have been able
to finish their studies when illness
had interrupted a final yeaz. In
conjunction with other bodies it
supports a Tuberculosis Hospital
where students are visited by
tutors from the nearest university
and thus whilst isolated in body
they are not isolated in spirit.
Provision is even made for stu-
dents to take examinations in the
hospital providing that their medi-
cal condition is suitable.
All this and much else too de-
tailed and involved to describe
here. Prior to joining l.C. as a
P.G. I came into contact with
nearly every branch of N.U.S. I
have attended four of its Council
meetings, various specialist meet-
ings and regional conferences and
even with the scepticism with
which I viewed many of the
speeches I have always been im-
pressed with the fundamental
soundness and character of the
National Union.
When will Imperial College
accept its responsibilities and add
its considerable weight and intelli-
gence to the councils of its fellow
students ?

INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
