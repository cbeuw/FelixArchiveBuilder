STAN
THE
MAN
" The President, secretary, or any member of the Theospofficial
Society wanted in the main hall, please." The familiar voice intones
the time honoured formula over the Tannoy in the Union every
lunchtime ; it belongs, of course, to the amiable Union porter, " Stan
the Man." Stanley Branker was born in Barbados in 1918, and
after many travels to the four corners of the globe, finally ended up
at IC, where he has become a familiar figure to all who use the
Union Buildings.
At school he studied classics,
and eventually started his work-
ing life as a school teacher. Two
years of this, however, convinced
him that teaching was not the
career for him, being neither
lucrative nor sufficiently inter-
esting to one who yearned for a
more adventurous life. Far hori-
zons were beckoning, and it was
natural that he should try his
hand at a life afloat. His mother
had been a concert pianist, and
Stan himself had played the piano
from an early age, so that he
joined the Canadian National
Steamship Line as a pianist on
their luxury cruises. He sailed
with this line for some time and
managed to see a great deal of
the world before his ship was tor-
pedoed off Bermuda at the be-
ginning of the war.
This seemed like a good cue for
a change of profession, and he
wentto Curasol in the Dutch
went to Curasol in the Dutch
West Indies where he trained as a
cracking unit operator with the
Shell Oil Company. After the war
Stan re-joined the Merchant
Navy for a short time, but was
soon off again on his wanderings,
this time roaming about North
America, trying his hand at a
variety of jobs, working for part
of the time at his old trade, play-
ing the piano in a night club.
Finally, in 1955, he decided to
come to England. During his
tailing days, Stan had visited
most of the world, and had come
tp the conclusion that England
was the only place to live,
weather notwithstanding. In fact,
he even admits to liking the wea-
ther here, especially the amount
of variety. It seems fantastic,
particularly at this time of the
year, that anyone could possibly
like our weather, but I suppose
that it is possible to get tired of
anything, even continual sun-
shine.
Before coming to IC in 1959,
Stan worked for the Decca Radio
and T V Company, and also
managed to put in three years
part time service with the Terri-
torial Army. He has now:been
our Union porter for three years,
which for him is quite a long
time to stay anywhere, but says he
quite likes it here. Even more
surprising is that he has quite a
good opinion of students as a
whole, though sometimes they
can be rather trying. He recalls
•the typical example of a young
female voice trying to contact a
young man named John via the
Union phone: " Oh, is that Im-
perial College ? I want to speak
to John.'"
" Which John ?"
" I don't know his name, but
I think he is either a chemist or
a physicist, or something, average
height, medium build, and speaks
with a slight Welsh accent."
A tall order, it must be agreed,
yet somehow or other John is
found (sometimes) and other
problems like this one also
manage to get themselves solved
with the assistance of the man at
the Union door. Thanks Stan.
THEATRE
T H E PHYSICISTS
At the Aldwych.
Reviewed by D. Farrell.
" The Physicists," a new play by the Swiss dramatist Friedrich
Durrenmatt, had its British premier on January 9th, put on by the
Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych. Under the guise of a
comedy, Durre'nmatt has written a stylish, spiky parody of our times.
The form of the play is an example of " compressionism," in which
violence and tension is produced by physically confining the charac-
ters and insulating them from society. This form, developed by
Strindberg, Chekov and O'Neille, seemed to be in danger of running
to seed in Pinter and Becket (the latter's " Happy Days " is a very
unhappy evening at the " Royal Court").
We are presented with three — — -
physicists confined in a Swiss
sanatorium, who display palpable
symptoms of madness, one think-
ing he is Newton, another Ein-
stein. They kill their three Judo-
trained nurses in rapid succes-
sion, and male boxing champions
are substituted at great cost. We
then learn from Newton and Ein-
stein that they are not mad, but
in fact agents of rival govern-
ments, and that the third man is
the greatest genius in the field of
physics. This fellow has to admit
that he has been knocking off the
Theory of Gravitation as a side-
line, but badgering by the other
two produces a reaction of high
moral dismay, in which he claims
to prefer a madhouse to either of
their prisons : he has burned his
little trifle on gravitation and
wouldnt' think of jeopardising the
very existence of humanity by
publishing it. Meanwhile, the
woman doctor in charge of the
sanatorium reveals that she is
mad, but has managed to make a
photo-copy of the Gravitation
Theory, and is going into mass
production. (We are not told
whether this is of bombs or anti-
gravity boots).
At this fait accompli, the phy-
sicists relapse into their palpable
symptoms of madness, and leave
the world in charge of the mad
woman psychiatrist.
On the comedy level, the play
is quite successful: the first night
audience chortled away happily
at the droll effect of madness
turned on and off Tike a Russ
Conway smile. However, unlike
" The Fireraisers " by Durren-
matt's compatriot Max Frisch,
this play, for me, became rather
too strongly polarised into farce
and moralising—one had to re-
adjust one's frame of mind from
scene to scene, and this seemed to
weaken the dramatic impulse.
On the moral level, however,
the play is really alive, and actu-
ally frames one or two judg-
ments. The Gravity man who
has feigned madness to save the
world from his thoughts realizes
his stupidity—-thought by its
nature cannot remain the pro-
perty of one man ; he can only
delay the proeress of science by
opting out. The woman doctor
who oozes compassion for hu-
manity earlier on is self con-
demned (" I couldn't love any-
body in particular, so I decided
to love humanity ").
This is decidedly a play worth
seeing, and it brings the total of
Durrenmatt plays presented in
London to three (out of his eight
stage plays); this is the man who
is considered by many to be the
leading dramatist of the German
speaking theatre.
FILM
M U T I N Y O N T H E B O U N T Y
A costume-piece epic starring
Marlon Brando as an Englisn
dandy, made oy a previously-con-
sidered mediorcre director, is
hardly going to raise much
hopeful expectations in many
people's minds, but fortunately
"" Mutiny on the Bounty " proves
to be one of the finest films made
for a long time.
The film's finest moments oc-
cur in the first part of the pic-
ture. The meeting of Captain
Bligh (Trevor Howard) and
Christian (Brando), his second
in command, the preparation for
the voyage, the journey to Tahiti,
build up a magnificent atmos-
phere. The dialogue in places is
extremely funny, and the scenery
is magnificent.
Once at Tahiti, the pace slows
down a bit, but the entertainment
value remains. The scene where
Christian is sent on a diplomatic
mission (to make love to the
chief's daughter), accompanied
by the strains of " Rule Britan-
nia," is unforgettable, as is the
scene where Bligh does a " Knees
up " with some Tahitan vahines.
Here again, the film scores once
again with breathtaking photo-
graphy of the island.
With the setting sail of the
" Bounty " the film loses some of
its impact, and the actual mutiny
scene, while convicing enough,
leaves one wondering if full use
had been made of the dramatic
potential of two actors like
Brando and Howard. The end-
ing lacks finesse, with Christian
as the big hero, without ever con-
vincing us of the villany of Bligh.
This is in fact the main fault, an
unconvincing villain. Unfor-
tunately for Bounty, this prob-
lem of cruelty—^rieht or wrong,
was far more forcibly discussed
in Billy Budd, but for sheer spec-
tacle alone, the film is first class
entertainment.
