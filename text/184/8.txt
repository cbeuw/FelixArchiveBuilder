•PLUM PUDDING RACES
The Boat Club this year entered four crews for the Thames
Plum Pudding Races, a lighthearted handicap race over one mile.
The conditions were amongst the worst seen by many of the com-
petitors, with a strong wind blowing against a high flood tide.
All four crews were eventually boated despite the efforts of
several members to hide within the warmth of the lounge, and within
a matter of minutes, everyone was wet through, and looking forward
to nursing a cold for the whole of the vacation.
The race was started in the
traditional manner (i.e., half an
hour late) with the slower crews
first, the faster crews up to a
minute behind. The second VIII
retired after one stroke, "Her-
cules " Dean having broken his
blade. Rumour has it that the
captain was heartily thanked by
the whole crew, who as a result
were able to spend the remainder
of the time in the bar.
Of the remaining IC crews, the
4th VIII stopped half way over
the course, as further progress
would have resulted in total im-
mersion. It being still eight hours
to Sunday, this was decided to be
uncalled for. The first eight de-
cided on a similar plan of cam-
paign, but left the decision to
abandon the race till 100 yards
from the finish.
The 3rd eight alone carried the
flag through to the finish, but
were unable to win the barrel of
beer which went to the Thames
first eight.
After a considerable time spent
drying and warming the exterior,
the crews proceeded to moisten
their interiors at the bar, prior to
an excellent dinner, at which the
members of Thames attempted to
show IC how to enjoy a Boat
Club Dinner. The general opinion
was that in this field IC is un-
beatable.
G.P.
Mountaineering Club
Last year, though small in numbers, the club was very active,
as witnessed by the very successful Alpine meet held over the summer
vacation. In October there was a large intake of freshers, including
many with ability or enthusiasm, and if these new members can be
encouraged to take an active part in running the club, the future
looks very promising.
Meets started well at Ogiveri, with a lot of climbing. Llanberis
and Stanage gave us all they had to offer in the way of bad weather,
and some solid drinking. Back at Llanberis again (somewhat de-
pleted in numbers) several members had notable successes in kinder
circumstances.
Over the New Year a party
of ten climbed and skiid in Glen-
coe. Conditions could have been
better, but the snow experience
was valuable. It must be ad-
mitted, however, that on 1st
January several members of the
party displayed a marked lack of
keenness!
This term we have another full
programme of meets and lectures,
and are also embarking on sev-
eral new ventures. Pete Scott is
producing a printed journal for
the first time, and Pete Gregory
is organising a mountain rescue
course for club members with
the help of the R.A.F.

r e a p a rich reward with
The ever-increasiiig demand for
power constitutes a major chal-
lenge to the Central Electricity
Generating Board and to the men
and women who work within it. A n
industry with an assured future,
the Board offers an exciting career
to young scientists and engineers
with ability and vision.
If you welcome the chance to do J
some original thinking, and you
relish the prospect of technical
adventure, you will find ample
scope in Research and Develop-
ment with the Board. Physicists,
Metallurgists, Mathematicians,
C h e m i s t s and Engineers are
needed for work which involves
fundamental and applied research
into conventional, nuclearand novel
methods of generation. There are
also openings in operational work
for engineers, where a two-year
training scheme is available.

Looking further ahead the
summer vacation promises well.
Mike Key is leading an expedi-
tion to East Greenland, with
mountaineering as a main objec-
tive. Three first year members
are going to Jan Mayen Island.
A month long course in Alpine
climbing is being arranged.
We hope to encourage in the
Club all aspect of mountain craft,
from walking to tension climbing,
icework to map reading, and
camping, for mountaineering im-
plies all these and much more.
Interested ? Drop us a note, or
join us some Tuesday evening
(club night) in the bar.
U.L. Hockey Cup mtsmwmmmm
On the last Wednesday of last
term C.E.M. knocked the I.C.
Hockey side out of the U.L. Cup.
It was a bleak afternoon, indeed
a preview of the worse weather to
come. The already saggy C.E.M.
pitch was covered with snow. Ex-
perience told us where the side-
lines were. The captains, to most
people's amazement, decided to
play . . . " it's the same for both
sides." Luckily a red cricket ball
Was available, a hockey ball
Would soon have been lost.'1
The T C . defence played well
Hp, relying on their speed to get
•back to defend the circle. This
they usually did, but C.E.M. had
several dangerous breakthroughs
before they scored. Left Back
Rao pulled a muscle in his back
while trying to make a quick
turn, and might have stopped the
attack on the half-way line, but
as it was the ball was in the net
with the defence still that crucial
yard behind the man with ithe
ball.

I.C. fought hard to the end, and
often came close to scoring. The
C.E.M. goalkeeper made two
good saves from short corner
shots, and several other shots just
missed. Territorially I.C. had
most of the game, they had about
three times as many shots at goal,
and if they had adapted them-
selves a little better to atrocious
conditions and had some luck
they may havewon.
So C.E.M. have now beaten us
in both the Rugby and Hockey
Cups. They must be a big col-
lege.
