SLOW PROGRESS
SOUTH-SIDE
NEARING
COMPLETION
(ASYMPTOTICALLY)
At the end of last term, an
official notice appeared on the
College notice boards, stating
what had been suspected all
along, that the Halls of Residence
on South Side will not be open in
the Easter Term, and that it was
hoped that some of the accom-
modation will be available in the
Summer Term. As a comparison
of the accompanying photographs
with those printed in our second
issue last term will show, there
does not appear to have been
much progress made since that
time, and it is hard to believe
that the refectories in South Side
which were to be opening
" shortly " will be ready this term
either.
The only consoling thought
about all this is that " better late
than never "'—South Side will
still be a boon to the College
whenever it finally opens (Oct.
1963 ?)

LECTURE —
It has come to the attention of
F E L I X that Bob Finch, one of
the leading lights behind the
NUS movement, and regular con-
tributor to " Scrutiny " is not
only contemplating matrimony,
but is actually getting married in
the near future and in a
church at that. What is even
more surprising is that his best
man will be Don Pearson, the Stu-
dent Orator who wasn't, because
he objected to various phrases of
a semi-religious nature in t'ie de-
claration that he was to read out
on the occasion of last Com-
memoration Day. When asked
about his decision to participate,
Don Pearson replied that he had
been won over by the prospec-
tive bride.
One wonders if there would be
any form of Humanist Society here
if there was more than a sprinkling
of the fair sex. Joking apart, all
best wishes to Bob and his bride
from F E L I X ; if he divulges
where the ceremony is to take
place, there might even be a
photo in the next issue.
Mr. Peter Runge, Thursday,
10th January.
At a General Studies Lecture
last Thursday, Mr. Peter Runge,
Deputy President of the Federa-
tion of British Industries and
Chairman of Tate & Lyle Ltd.,
gave a spirited defence of those
much maligned people, the ty-
coons.
Beginning with a description of
Britain's importance as a com-
mercial power, he said that, with
lation we produce 17 per cent.
1.8 per cent, of "the world's popu-
of the world's manufactured
goods. He then described the
Empire over which the tycoons
rule; 11 million workers in the
manufacturing industries alone,
with an annual gross product of
£10,000 m.; and went on to ex-
amine more closely some charac-
teristics of tycoonery. The genus
" tycoon " is peculiar in that it
exhibits strong suicidal tenden-
cies ; more precisely it tends to
drown itself in a sea of paper.
He made a plea for restraint
among scientists, " who," he said,
"are particularly prone to using
ten long words where one short
one will do."
Discussing profits and wages he
said that, despite many opinions
to the contrary, there was no real
difference between a worker
wanting more wages and a share-
holder wanting an increased pro-
fit. It would be far more sen-
sible if both sides would work to
increase the total earnings of the
company ; the way the cake was
shared out afterwards would be
an entirely separate matter.
Tycoons, he concluded, are
really necessary. They work ex-
tremely hard, and cheerfully
accept enormous responsibilities.
They are more willing to accept
innovations than a committee,
and are less prone to " collective
dishonesty " which often charac-
terises committee decisions.
Answering questions, he agreed
that the Unions were in a mess
largely due to their having too
much power. The Common
Market will help to solve this
problem by diluting their power :
the Market will also be a won-
derful thing for our country's
economy. He expressed com-
nlete confidence that British In-
dustry "will run rings round the
frogeies."
