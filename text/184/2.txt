EDITORIAL
A new term, a new year, and a welcome back to all our readers
from the Felix staff. It was hoped that we would have some new
refectories as well, but apparently for reasons best known to them-
selves, the contractors have still not finished the South Side building.
Apparently, the architects' new year resolution is to " wait and see."
1 fiat is all that we can do unfortunately.
A new feature of F E L I X this term is the Carnival Page. The
1963 Charity Carnival is on the way, and from now until May, there
will be a regular space reserved for Carnival news, progress of various
work done, and last but not least, profiles of prospective Carnival
Queens. All the best carnivals have queens, and this is no exception,
so that if there is a pretty girl in your year, here is a perfect oppor-
tunity to find out what her hobbies are—" it's all right, I'm writing
a profile of you for Felix." Profiles should not be longer than 200
words, and photographs should be 2Jin. x 4in. If necessary, photos
can be taken by the Felix photographers.
Finally, F E L I X would like to apologise to Don Pearson for a
gaffe in the last issue of last term. The article on NUS, replying to
John Preece's article was written by Don Pearson, whose name was
unfortunately omitted due to a printer's error. It was certainly not
his intention that the article should appear anonymously.
COLCUTT
The completion date of South
Side seems to be further away
than ever. The Hostel accom-
modation, which was originally
supposed to be ready for last
October, will not be ready until
next term, and it now seems likely
that the refectories will not be
ready till Easter. Many people
will not be prepared to move into
Hall for the last crucial examin-
ation term, so the Halls may have
a dismal half-full first term. The
refectory situation now seems to
be desperate ; judging by the
number of bitter complaints in
the Suggestions book, a large
number of people are fed up with
the meals being dished up. Of
course, the kitchens are hope-
lessly overloaded, so we cannot
expect Mr. Mooney to maintain
a high standard, but the Sugges-
tions Book seems to be the only
way that the consumer can regis-
ter protest. It is to be hoped that
these are being passed on to who-
ever is responsible for the de-
plorable hold-up on South Side.
The South Side hold-up is by
no means unique in the College.
The same thing is happening at
Harlington, where the contractors
are now almost four months be-
hind, with the changing room ex-
tension. The new hot water sys-
tem which was to have been put
in over the Christmas vacation is
Itill not ready. Perhaps it is for-
tunate that the pitches are unfit
for "play, otherwise games would
have been cancelled for lack of
washing facilities.
Yet another date to be put
back is the next Union Meeting.
This will now be held on January
29th in the Royal Geographical
Society's Hall, the extra accom-
modation being made available
for the NUS Debate. Bob Finch,
who is proposing the motion that
we should join will officially be
on his honeymoon, but intends to
be present at the meeting. Such
devotion to the welfare (?) of the
Union is indeed surprising.
Phoenix arrived in time for the
end of the last term after all. It
did not sell as well as expected,
and made a loss of some £30.
The most disappointing feature of
this magazine is the lack of con-
tributions from the members of
the Unio.i. If the President had
not mislaid his diary, the only
contributions from the present
student body would have been
the Social and Athletics reviews
and the Editor's contributions.
Incidentally, these three writers
all work in the same research
group. Surely there are other
people in the College who are
capable and interested enough to
wri+
e articles for Phoenix. The
next issue will be out later this
term and it is still not too late
for contributions—so get a pen
out and writs.

Dear Sir,
It is unfortunate that the
article: "N.U.S.—YES OR NO,"
was published in the final issue
of last term's paper since most
people will be unable to remember
the substance and form of this
disgusting piece of literature. The
article inadequately attempted to
answer some of the criticisms of
N.U.S. put forward by John
Preece in the prevous issue of
Felix. The writer argued that be-
cause we give £5,000 out of the
reserves towards the new sports
centre and send teams occasion-
ally on tour, we can therefore
afford to join N.U.S. I would
merely ask which would benefit
the students of this College more :
spending our limited resources on
the above, or sending seven dele-
gates to N.U.S. Conferences and
our -membership thereof (about
£300-^ 100 per annum). He then
goes on to say that he realises
our financial situation is difficult
and that the solution lies in rais-
ing Union fees. Until then an
" interim solution will have to be
found."
It is about time the writer re-
cognised the fact that we are
powerless to raise Union fees, and
long before he suggested doing so,
urgent approaches were being
made to the proper authorities
with such a goal in mind. The
Union has been told that its fees
cannot be raised for at least three,
and probably five, years. I should
be interested to learn the writer's
" interim soluton."
My main objection to the
article, however, is that it is no-
thing more than "a protracted
personal attack on John Preece.
If we are to be regaled with more
of these pro-N.U.S. (or, for that
matter, anti-N.U.S.) epistles, then
I suggest that personalities be
omitted. In conclusion, it suffices
to say that John Preece put his
name to his own article, whilst
the reply appears to be anony-
mous—(though we can guess its
origin).
Yours,
CHRIS LIDDLE.
EDITOR'S NOTE.
The article became " anony-
mous " due to a printers' error.
As mentioned elsewhere, it was
submitted by Don Pearson, to
whom the Ed. has already ex-
presed apologies.
Dear Sir,
I have been greatly surprised
to find that IC students do not
wear academic gowns to lectures
and important ceremonies such as
Commemoration Day.
In my country, Nigeria, it is
the custom for College and Unt-
verstiy Students to wear gowns.,
and these are worn in some
Colleges here, notably in Kings
College. Why should not IC join
in the practise. As " Britain's
leading University College" (a
newspaper description of IC) we
should show the light for other
Colleges to follow.
An undergraduate gown is
cheap, about £3, so that there is
no question of some students not
being able to afford it. Apart
from the cost, it is reasonable to
regard the gown as a symbol of
University or College studentship;
clad in a gown, students would
tend to behave in a more respon-
sible fashion.
Could this matter not bejooked
into by the College and Union
officers ?
Yours faithfully,
M.A.A.

N.U.S., Education and Student
Welfare.
There have been several inter-
esting articles on the virtue of
I.C.U. affiliating itself to the Nat-
ional Union of Students. They
have discussed some of the as-
pects of N.U.S. and its services
to students and one of the most
important of these is the depart-
ment of N.U.S. which deals with
Education and Welfare.
Many students regard the com-
ments of their fellows on Edu-
cation as immature and governed
by a desire to be heard rather than
a desire to state reasoned opinions.
There is some truth in this atti-
tude but the reasoned student
opinion on the education being
provided in the Universities and
Colleges of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland does fill a void
and which some educationalists
admit is an important contribu-
tion to the development of..Edu-
cation'"' The customers are com-
menting on the goods offered, a
not uncommon practice in the
commercial world.
The National Union of Students
has over the last few years pre-
sented the opinion of ts members
to several Government Commit-
tees specifically detailed to ex-
amine the British Higher Educa-
tional System and allied problems.
The evidence of N.U.S. presented
to the Robbins Committee was a
well balanced account of student
opinion on prevailing conditions
and what it considered to be
future needs. In this evidence
were inter alia, statements reques-
ting a better preparation of sixth
formers for University life, less
emphasis on total knowledge ac-
quired in the University under-
graduate courses and more on real
education, the provision of more
Halls of Residence, to be com-
munities not simply an agglomer-
ation of bed-sitters and the funda-
mental statement that all people
qualified and able to benefit from
a course of higher education
should be able to do so. Mem-
oranda on Teaching methods in
Universities and on Safety Pro-
visions in Institutions of Higher
Education were also accepted as a
