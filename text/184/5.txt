T H E LONGEST D A Y *k
or "How We Helped John Wayne
Win the War."
Closely following the book of
the same title, this film is an ac-
curate-as-possible reconstruction
of D-Day. Despite the obvious
attempts at authenticity, a cer-
tain amount of corn creeps in,
which tends to lower the enter-
tainment value. German and
French forces speak in their re-
spective languages, with subtitles,
and this slows the action to some
extent. The initial build up of
forces on both sides of the Chan-
nel is excellently done, with a
good representation of the per-
sonalities involved, the bicker-
ings, the patriotic ambitions of
the parties, but when the actual
landings take place and the fight-
ing begins, the film lacks con-
tinuity.
We see Robert Mitchum casu-
ally strolling up and down a body
strewn beach chewing a cigar,
Henry Fonda limping around,
pretending to be Roosevelt Jnr.,
Kenneth More hoping the shell-
ing will stop " as it is making his
bulldog nervous." By a hay-
stack we have Richard Burton
soliloquising, and one half ex-
pects to see Liz poke her head
through the straw. There is
Jerry Lewis type sequence with
squads of German soldiers pass-
ing squads of Americans, neither
recognising the " enemy." To top
it all. we have Sean " James
Bond" Connery, as an Irish
private. Well, I ask you !
As entertainment, the "Longest
Day " is one big bans, and one
big laugh from beginning to end.
As a serious motion picture, how-
ever, it does not quite make the
grade.

NEW RCS SOCIETY
— PROPOSED
ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
F O R M E D
Some time last term, several
members of the Royal College
of Science came up with the idea
of forming a society to further in-
terest in Astronomy. The first
meeting was held at the end of
last term, and some fifty people
attended. As a result, a com-
mittee is now in existence, and
the Society has applied for
official recognition as an RCS
Society.
Arrangements are being made
to acquire certain observational
facilities for members. It is hoped
to have occasional use of the 20
inch reflecting telescope housed
on top of the Science Museum
extension, as well as one of the
several smaller instruments.
The first lecture on the subject
is being arranged for some time
this term, and anyone interested
in joining should get in Jouch
with the Society via the Union
Rack.
T H A T WAS T H E NIGHT
T H A T WAS
Once again, the more sober
characters of I.C., i.e., the Mines-
men, were able to let their hair
down in an affair which brought
the term to a fitting conclusion.
The night began for many in var-
ious hostelries in and around the
precincts of the R.S.M., which no
doubt laid the foundations for a
great deal of " bon hommie."
To the accompaniment of a
versatile band, a large flock of
penguins partnered by scintillat-
ing birds mastered the intricacies
of a tricky surface.
Floral decoration, and a Keg
variety of " flowers " helped to
promote a congenial atmosphere
which persisted throughout the
night. A n excellent buffet was
followed by a cabaret which was
subtle in its manner and pleas-
ingly free from vulgarity (Note,
Mr. Harris!). The jazz band
took over at 3 a.m. and the fact
that activities continued until 5.30
was a measure of the success of
a thoroughly enjoyable night.
Thanks are due to the Ents. Com-
mittee and the cabaret artistes(?)
for the able way in which they
effected the arrangements.
It was very pleasing to have
several members of staff present,
and their lively participation was
appreciated. It is to be hoped
that next year the Mines Ball as a
formal function will become an
informal association for more
staff and students.

In this second article about high spots for the more discerning,
it is intended to give a brief review of some dining and drinking clubs
which are within the means of the average student.
Probably one of the least expensive places for a drink in the
West End is " Bev's Blenheim," situated off New Bond Street. Drinks
here are half price between 8 and 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
and refreshments, in the form of continental snacks, are available.
Bev's is essentially the sort of place at which one soon gets to know
the " mates," and then anything may happen—from members' bar
competitions to trips abroad. Although dress not have to be very
formal, shirt and tie are advisable.
A small and intimate club
where one can wine, dine and
dance, is the "Living Room,"
situated in the Notting Hill re-
development area. The food is
good and inexpensive, and al-
though the kitchen is under the
supervision of a French chef,
steaks and chicken-in-the-basket
" Southern Fried " are the spec
ialities of the house. There is an
excellent three-piece band, and, a
definite atmosphere. Finally
there is a grand piano bar off
which you can eat and drink.
Dress?—Eounge suits.
For the more artistic, there is
the Rennaissance. in Harrington
Road. Kensington. Here one
can dine (steaks a speciality—
good meal for about 15/-) and
dance in an atmosphere of art
and culture. A visit here should
provide an entertaining evening,
and dress—Kensington set arty
get-up.
For students living south of
the river, a visit to the Toby
Gym, off the Old Kent Road,
Bermondsey, should provide
some interest on that spare even-
ing. Both a club and a training
gym, the Toby provides training
quarters for many famous visiting
boxers from overseas, and except
on Tuesdays, is very much alive
with a band and local star vocal-
ists. Dress is very informal.
Turning to the West End again,
there is just room to mention two
places. One of the oldest clubs
in Soho is the Mandrake, "almost
a night club without the host-
esses." The atmosphere is cos-
mopolitan and there are three
bars, a dance room with a verv
good band, and even a small
chemmy room; chess is also
played here. The Mandrake
seems to be a meeting place for
all the world, dress is informal,
and the bar claims to stock over
500 different drinks.
Finally, a more salubrious es-
tablishment on Foley Street, the
Paint Box (Club Tokyo). " You
may sketch our models," says
Jimmy Mclure at the Paint Box.
Everything is provided here—
food, wine, women and music.
The haunt of rich, tired business-
men wanting to forget their wor-
ries (at the office and at home)
in the exotic atmosphere. The
