MOTOR CLUB
In spite of the weather and
Christmas spirit discouraging
motoring, the motor club has not
been inactive over the vacation.
Notably " Bo " was reuphols-
tered with genuine leather, com-
pleting the programme of restor-
ation begun last Easter. Since
then he has been painted all over,
fitted with new wings and had an
engine rebuild, so that he is now,
according to his maker, Lt.-Col.
Browne, in better condition than
when built 61 years ago.
The project of acquiring two
" Go-Karts" also went ahead
during the vacation and it is
hoped to get these before the end
of the term, providing the club
with the opportunity to enjoy this
highly exciting though miniature
form of motor sport.
For the meetings this term
quite an interesting programme
has been arranged. Apart from
some newly released films there
are two talks, one of which is by
Raymond Baxter, the B.B.C.
motoring commentator and rally
driver. The highlight is, of
course, the annual dinner to
which five motor racing drivers
have been invited including the
top lady driver, Christabel Car-
lisle.
So far only one factorv visit has
been confirmed and that is to
Aston Martins at the beginning
of February.
SWIMMING
D E L F T SWIMMING T E A M
VISIT IC
In the last match of term,
again the strong Delft University
Team, IC drew in the swimming,
30-30, and lost the Polo 3-0. The
few spectators present were re-
warded with perhaps the best
Polo match played for some time.
The passing of both teams was
quick and play see-sawed from
end to end as attacking moves
tested the agility of both goal-
keepers.
From the first encounter, it was
obvious that Delft were shooting
far more strongly than IC, how-
ever, tight defensive play mini-
mised this advantage. Towards
the end of the second quarter,
Delft opened the scoring with a
fine backhand shot from the right
wing, and although IC pressed
hard, they were unable to make
much impression on the Delft
goalkeeper. Delft then went on
to score two more goals, more by
good attacking than by defensive
mistakes, and finished worthy
winners.
U L U Water Polo League
IC 1st against N C L won 4-3 (last
year's leaders).
IC 2nd against Battersea, won
5-1.
HARDLY HANSARD
COUNCIL MEETING
It was with great pleasure that Felix received an invitation from
the President, Mr. Chandmal, to send an observer to the last Council
meeting of last term. The following report is submitted as a precis
of a meeting which started at 5.45 p.m. and ended three hours later
with a toast in champagne, purchased privately by the executive,
treasurer and the three old student reps., to the one hundredth anni-
versary of the committee. It is an oft repeated cry that Council
" says much, and accomplishes little," possibly because a committee
of Over twenty members must needs have difficulty in reaching agree-
ment. Yet the impression received was that of this score, only a
small proportion spoke needlessly, and at this particular meeting even
that was limited. they be swimmers, footballers, or
The meeting opened with some debaters. Mr. Chandmal re-
ported that I.C.W.S.C. had been
allowed a grant since they played
every known game—" cheap at
£10 a head." What game, or
where they intended to play it
was amongst the classified infor-
mation not yet released. Several
reports in fact suffered from their
confidential nature, and the Presi-
dent expressed his wish that this
should not become general prac-
tice. The Athletic Committee
was one report which came under
this category. After extensive
muttering about hilarious meet-
ings and with many etcs. Mr.
Phillips told of the acquisition of
a new all-weather golf net to be
erected in one of the fives courts
in Princes Gardens ; also a pavi-
lion for the cross country club,
site not disclosed.
The General Studies Commit-
tee expressed themselves dissatis-
fied with the Exec's choice of
date for the next Union Meeting.
The day chosen was the same as
that on which Mr. Holroyd, an
important speaker from I.C.I,
had been invited to speak. This
had been achieved With some
difficulty and it was feared that
the N.U.S. debate at the Union
meeting would detract from his
audience. Messrs. Phillips and
Gardiner were soon going in fine
form with biting sarcasm and
pedantic quibbling ; the President
and secretary were clearly not
happy about this attack, and as
the temperature rose, further
members of council joined the
redoubtable Phillips and Gardi-
ner, perhaps feeling that the exec-
utive were not being as co-opera-
tive as they might. It was left to
Dr. Weale to pour the oil and
suggest the motion " that the
Executive reconsider its deci-
sion." This was passed, and in
view of the fact that many would
wish to attend both factions it is
hoped that the date of the Union
meeting will be changed.
Of the fiasco of the New Halls
of Residence, there is no need to
write more—-it is sincerely hoped
that members of the college are
not taking further FINAL dates
too seriously. The refectories
make an annual loss of £1,400,
but a move to raise prices was
fought by Mr. Chandmal who
considered this unjustified unless
further facilities were provided.
Meanwhile presumably the Col-
lege must foot the bill.
Under A O.B. came perhaps
discussion concerning Union fees;
these it appears will not be raised
till the College can provide added
facilities ; only the sports centre
in the foreseeable future could
justify this move. The secretary
then gave the report of the exe-
cutive committee and mentioned
the Boat Club fiasco when
damage was done to Union pro-
perty ; he suggested a motion im-
posing penalties on the authors
of any further damage of this
nature. He was rapidly taken up
on his wording of the motion by
the watchful Mr. Phillips who
had many things to say on the
subject (" these Dinners are
always drunken occasions "). The
main complaint by the executive
was that damage was frequently
paid for by the clubs, and not
the individuals concerned; the
treasurer Dr. Weale then tactfully
intervened as he was wont to do
on several occasions, and the
motion " that members of the
club will pay for the damage
caused, and then may not be al-
lowed to hold the dinner the fol-
lowing year at the discretion of
the executive," was passed. Also
mentioned was a proposed film of
life at I.C. costing approximately
£300 to produce—'the President
hurriedly explained that it was
intended to raise this money from
" old student bodies and other
sources."
For the R.C.C. Mr. Had in
made the plea that the whole
question of storage space in the
Union be looked into ; upon Mr.
Chandmal promising that it
would. Mr. Phillips made the
first of several complaints about
the use of his gymnasium as a
general dump. Mr. Pearson de-
divered the S.C.C. report with a
well-practised and efficient com-
mittee manner; at time pompous
but always accurate and concise :
Scrutiny, C.N.D. and their forma-
tion of a " Christian sub-group,"
S.C.C. tours for students to over-
seas conventions, all well covered
despite interruptions. After con-
siderable discussion into the
whereabouts of money for tours
it was decided unanimously that a
prospective visit abroad must be
supported by the tours sub-
committee, but may obtain finan-
cial support from its respective
club committee. This is un-
doubtedly a good thing since
students representing the College
should have its support whether
the most interesting single item
of the evening ; a request through
Mr. Morden, by some students at
the Royal College of Art for per-
mission to use our athletic facili-
ties, i.e., gym and changing
rooms. Mr. Gardiner correctly
pointed out that conditions are
inadequate for our own students,
let alone those of the R.C.A.
However, neither they, nor
R.C.M. have anything like the
social or athletic facilities which
we have, and they would benefit
substantially by being allowed
their use. Since we already draw
on several of their facilities (e.g.
art director Phoenix) it seems
hard to refuse. Informal co-
operation between members of
the three Colleges was encour-
aged, especially over things such
as Carnivals, Concerts and Social
occasions ; a portent perhaps for
a future University of South Ken-
sington.
Finally, Mr. Phillips, speaking
forcefully and heatedly, proposed
that the Union pay £20 towards
the loss of coats (stolen outside
the Union lavatories) from two
Dutch students then swimming
against the College. Messrs.
Chandmal and Preece opposed
the idea claiming that the Union
could not be held responsible (as
of course it cannot, according to
notices prominently displayed ;
nor I think would anyone expect
it to be). But undeterred Phillips
foueht back : the notice had been
pinched—pees were provided, in-
viting the innocent Dutch to hang
their coats—the pegs have now
been removed, a sure admission
of guilt (said with fee'ihg) " the
situation is deplorable " . . . and
when the vote was taken, the
motion was carried quite con-
vincingly, and just as surprisingly.
Thus the meeting concluded, a
fair amount accomplished, some
stimulating discussion, some not
so stimulating, but all were
aareed that Council had not met
so amicably for a lona time. Mav
Felix ever be invited to future
meetings of Council.
EXPLORATION WEEK A T IC
February 11th—16th is " E x -
ploration Week" at Imperial
College. The Exploration Society
is holding an exhibition in the
Upper Lounge of the Union to
publicise the activities and
achievements of the IC expedi-
tions over the last three years.
The exhibition will be similar to
the highly successful one held
three years ago. It will be an op-
portunity for members of the Col-
lege to see the sort of work that
the College expeditions have been
doing, and to see at first hand
what has been achieved.
The Society's journal, " Ex-
ploration Review " will also be on
sale that week, containing ac-
counts of all last year's expedi-
tions, and some guest articles on
certain topical aspects of explora-
tion.
So remember, February 11th—
16th is Exploration Week.
