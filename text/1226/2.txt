Imperial to Remain Cool
A company headed by the for-
mer Tory cabinet minister John
Selwyn Gummer has offered to
upgrade the College's air condi-
tioning system to help combat
its energy shortage problem.
Earthcare Products promotes
absorption cooling, a system
which makes use of heat rather
than electrical energy, and
would therefore put less pres-
sure on the College's already
stretched energy resources.
Felix understands that Mr.
Gummer, M P for the Suffolk
Coastal constituency, contact-
ed the Rector personally to dis-
cuss the proposal.
The company is believed to
have offered to provide an inte-
grated cooling service - costing
£700,000 per year more than the
College is currently paying - for
the next forty years. Benedict
Gummer, son of the chairman
and spokesman for Earthcare,
told Felix that the company
aims to "ensure that the
College's energy spend goes
down so that it spends less on
its non-core business, leaving it
more money for what it does
best." Where efficiencies would
be made in College budgets in
order to find the money is not
known, however.
The College's demand for
electricity reaches a peak dur-
ing the summer months with
the widespread use of air con-
ditioning equipment. The prob-
lem is exacerbated by the
growth that the College has
undergone in recent years, and
the fact that people are also
working longer hours.
Laboratory equipment also
continues to be modernized
and miniaturized, meaning that
a larger amount of electrical
power is now consumed by
equipment occupying the same

£ 6 per hour?
The Emergency Night Bus Service
is looking for Stewards,
particularly women,
to work from the beginning
of the October term.
Ability to drive a Union minibus
is desirable, but not essential.
Shifts are available on Wednesday
and Friday evenings from midnight.

volume of space.
Speaking to Felix, Assistant
Director of Estates, Nigel Buck,
confirmed that an offer had
been received from Earthcare
but that the College was going
through the proper channels in
trying to find a contractor to
provide an integrated cooling
service for the College. A 'Pre-
Information Notice' for the work
was issued recently and the
procedure for awarding the
contract is anticipated to begin
in July.
The Estates Department has
had to conduct a process of
'load shedding' in recent sum-
mers in order to ensure that the
demand for electrical power
remains within the level of sup-
ply. The problem is expected to
recur once again this summer,
when further reduction of
demand is likely to be required.
