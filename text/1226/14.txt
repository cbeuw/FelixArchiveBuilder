NATALIE I M B R U G L I A - Wrong Impression
This is a wonderful piece of pop music from the not unattrac-
tive M s Imbruglia (see pic above). Wrong Impression is the sec-
ond single from her n e w album White Lilies Island, and it lays to
rest any doubts raised by the rather average-sounding That
Day. A beautifully laid-back verse leads effortlessly into a cho-
rus so catchy that it's been stuck in my head for the best part of
three days. Remember Torn? Well, this is just as good.

C H E M I C A L B R O T H E R S - Star Guitar
This twinkly gem from the Chemicals drifts dreamily along,
and is strangely optimistic without being joyous. A gorgeous
track that is sure to be heard continually in room threes every-
where for the next few months.

A C T U A L SIZE - Weights & Measures E P
At the beginning, this Bristol band's EP sounds like "indie-by-
numbers", with only the quirky Westcountry country and west-
ern vocals (see what I've done there?) keeping its head above
the turbulent waters of mediocrity. But then along comes a fan-
tastic Swan Lake sample, and the whol.e thing jumps out and
says "hey you, I am much more than another shit Trav-play-
sailor clone" i n a big distorted bass type voice. Weird, but unde-
niably good.

LO-FIDELITY A L L S T A R S - Sleeping Faster
Displaying their trademark eclectic influences and general
aversion to being pigeon-holed, the Lo-Fis new single is here.
Whilst not as strong as their previous offering, this is a single
that is proud to be unlike any other.

NO DOUBT - Hey Baby
What's going on? This is an interesting turn from No Doubt,
moving away from their sound of five years ago, or at least mix-
ing it with something like R&B. They're not the kind of band that
would get stuck in a rut though, and after listening a few more
times, Hey Baby seems to make more sense. I still cant say I'm
sure about the somewhat interesting rap by Bounty Killer, but
the song has grown on me.

C U S T O M BLUE - E P One
This downbeat mix of ethereal, icy electronica and more
homely acoustic leanings is a bit like a musical version of nou-
velle cuisine: impeccably tasteful, yet strangely unsatisfying.
A n d there's only so much you can put up with before you long
for a steak (or some AC/DC in this case). It's hard to actually
fault it while listening, but it's difficult to remember about two
minutes afterwards.

R O U N D SOUND feat O N Y X STONE & M C M A L I B U -
Whadda We Like?
UK garage with a nice underground feel - a million miles from
Dane Bowers and the like. Up-tempo and bouncy, this is a well
produced track, and the vocals are delivered with slick confi-
dence. I love the way they sing in their o w n London accents
rather than trying to sound American. It has a nice dirty beat
too, but lacks the substance to make it stand out from the crowd
or earn a place as anything more than an intro track.

90 DAY M E N - To Everybody
Bad wailing vocals over standard Lo-Fi tunes start this one off
on the wrong foot, but then wailing boy gives up and every-
thing gets better quickly. Once the brilliant piano kicks in and
proceeds to dominate the rest of the EP, it becomes very easy to
explain the sound of Chicago-based 90 Day Men: just think Ben
Folds fronting Fugazi. Nice.
