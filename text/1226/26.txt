More Caving? Goodness!
Gales and Rain. Three
masochists perforin contor-
tions in Pippikin Pot, and a
new 'Sunday' cave is found.
With the forecast for gales
and heavy rain, IC3 decided
to go pot-holing i n Yorkshire,
to see if w e could catch a bit
of snow too.
Soon after leaving college at
8pm w e were stuck in traffic
on Notting Hill Gate, a little bit
later w e arrived at Bull Pot
Farm, Lancashire. The drivers
raced us North through atro-
cious rain, spurred on by some
good tunes, they must have
been on something stronger
than tea, everyone else w a s
asleep. Arriving at Bull Pot
(home of the Red Rose Cave
and Pothole Club) at l a m ,
without a key w e were
relieved to find other people
there, lots of people, in fact
Oxford and Cambridge C C s
plus a few Manchester. A
quiet nights sleep on a mat-
tress was only broken by talk
of vomiting and mystery ill-
nesses in the night.
Saturday, three masochists
decided to do Pippikin Pot to
Link Pot, in the 80km Ease Gill
system. While two more sensi-
ble people d i d C o w Pot, aim-
ing to have a look at the
impressive Ease Gill main
streamway i n flood. The C o w
Pot Team were held up an hour
for some suspiciously
Southampton looking cavers
to do some SRT (Single Rope
technique) training on the 25m
entrance pitch to Cow. While
at the other end of the system
Team 'Whip M e For Pleasure'
were rigging the involved
Pippikin entrance series.
Finally 'Team Cow' got down
the triple rigged entrance
pitch and made headway, on
the roof traverse Clewin w a s
unstoppable, starting the rig-
ging about halfway along
before, undaunted, descend-
ing the b i g 50m pitch into the
abyss which is known as Fall
Pot, but the final rebelay a 'free
hanging' Y-hang w a s to prove
his undoing and plenty of time
was spent swinging i n the
black emptiness trying to get
the correct rope length for a
double bowline.
"You might want to check
rigging!" Were the reassuring
words shouted up the shaft,
before he continued to the bot-
tom. I w a s able to complete
my repertoire of singing and
whistling perched on a ledge
at the top of the pitch, when
he finally shouted 'rope free'.
At this point, somewhere far
off, Team W M F P w a s probably
gurgling in the Wet Wallows or
getting lost around Dusty
Junction looking for the way to
Link Pot. But Team Cow where
on the move again, descend-
ing out the roof into the cav-
ernous Fall Pot is always a
stunning experience, and with
waterfalls pouring i n from
every nook and cranny this
time w a s no exception.
Climbing down through the
massive boulders below Fall
Pot, w e looked down into the
main Ease Gill streamway,
over the roar of the river I
pointed to the ceiling above
us, there w a s plenty of fresh
foam on the roof indicating
where the water had probably
been the day before. Team
C o w then beat the retreat, tak-
ing a few photos on the way.
Saturday evening at the
farm w a s up to its usual stan-
dards, lots of drinking and
loud music. Tales were told by
the S & M team of crawls i n
water w i t h 2inches of air-
space.
Sunday, when most cavers
were returning and thinking of
getting home, a three m a n
team ventured down Aygill
Caverns, a compulsory late
morning visit to Bernie's Cafe
in Ingleton having delayed us.
Missing out on this normal
Sunday faffing process w a s
Andy, he had decided once
down Pippikin i n t w o days
didn't satisfy h i m a n d a
bounce trip to derig w a s in
order, the two Oxford lasses
he went with may have been
another reason. Aygill w a s an
unexpected pleasure, a good
'Sunday cave', the list of caves
fulfiling this criteria are few,
Sunday caving presents many
psychological barriers (ie wet
caving kit) and conflicting pri-
orities (ie sitting in a cafe
drinking tea/going caving).
But Aygill was near to the hut,
with a couple of nice ladder
pitches, done with some old
skool rigging and an impres-
sive streamway w h i c h
stopped us progressing any
further, but definitely good
enough for a revisit in dryer
weather.
The return journey to
London was, again, swift leav-
ing at 5.30pm from the farm
arriving back at 11pm. A small
oil leak was noticed, but it
was nothing much really.
Next caving trips:
8-10 February - Yorkshire
2-14th April - Romania
