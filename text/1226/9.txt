Horny

Cheese on toast w i t h
extra cheese and a side
helping of gorgonzola. If
you like brie, you'll like
this, is my advice.
iCU, 8pm-2am
Beats 4 Geeks!
I'm not sure whether
this is a nerd-bashing
festival or a festival of
music for Imperial stu-
dents. Not that they're
geeks, of course. Humf.

Bad Company
Unlikely is an under-
statement in this partic-
ular case. CIA agent is
killed, twin brother must
complete case. He's
trained by some veteran.
Anthony Hopkins. Right.
O
God, perhaps. Othello,
set in high school bas-
ket-ball community. Baz
Luhrmann, anyone?
Well, maybe it'll be
good. If you like musi-
cals. Hmmm.

Does one break out in
these when one hears
them? I know not, hav-
ing not done so. But
they're Swedish, so
might have cool names.

Well, they covered a
Michael Jackson song,
and frankly I don't know

they're Nu-Metal, or
