From Soho To The Caves Of Boho
It all began with a quick email
on Tuesday afternoon; "I'm
going to Fermanagh this
weekend. Do you want to
come?", asked Hugh Penney,
an IC3 member currently
studying in Glasgow. I quickly
checked all flight options, and
booked myself onto the 17:30
to Dublin, where Jerry, an ex-
IC student now working in
Dublin, would pick me up en
route to Fermanagh. I packed
my helmet, light, wetsuit, and
45m of rope; and off I went.
Jerry was waiting outside the
airport when I arrived, and we
were soon zooming north
through the Meath country-
side - the slight delay in leav-
ing Heathrow making sure we
missed the Friday evening
rush.
We arrived in the village of
Boho, roughly ten miles out-
side Enniskillen at around
22:00, just as Hugh and his
flatmate Dave pulled up in
their hire-car. Our contact,
Sean was already in the local,
McKenzie's, so we joined him
for some of the best Guinness
you're likely to taste. It wasn't
until many hours later that we
managed the five minute stroll
to our accommodation in the
luxurious Boho community
centre. Caving huts are rarely
plush, some are barely habit-
able, in contrast, this place
was a veritable mansion.
Next morning, we woke to
an overcast sky - good weath-
er in these parts. After a big
greasy cavers breakfast we
set off to our first cave -
Marble Arch. Marble A r c h
caves are tourist show-caves
on the edge of Cuilcagh
Mountain. Our plan was to
explore beyond the show
cave, and hopefully make it to
a beautiful passage called
Legnabrocky Way. It took us a
few attempts to locate the cor-
rect entrance, Sean then led us
through an easy squeeze to
the gated cavers route to the
tourist section of the cave. The
show cave is only open to the
public during the summer
months, so we were free to
explore it ourselves, however,
our only light came from our
head-torches. At the end of
the show-cave, a tall, wide
passage filled with ever deep-
ening water leads to a sump
that is only passable by
divers. We waded across the
stream to enter the sump
bypass -1 was glad of my wet-
suit at this point, but as soon
as we started squeezing uphill
into the bypass passage I
slowly started to steam. The
tight passage involved much
scrambling over and under
rocks until we eventually
broke back into the main
streamway, this time
upstream of the sump. I was
glad of the opportunity to cool
down, wallowing around in
deep water again, while the
others marvelled at the amaz-
ing marble passage wall. This
massive stream passage
ended in another sump, this
time without a dry bypass. We
turned off into a smaller tribu-
tary passage containing a
trickle of water. This section of
cave, Legnabrocky Way, is
well known for containing
beautiful stalactites and mud
formations. The passage is big
enough to walk along easily,
even Jerry, at six foot six inch-
es, didn't have to stoop. We
soon came across an area of
mud formations taped off by
the Speleological Union of
Ireland as a conservation
measure. Unfortunately, some-
one had trampled over the
area and destroyed much of
the passage. However, there
were still pristine white straw
stalactites in the roof, and a
small amazing chamber cov-
ered in flowstone and stalag-
mites W e proceeded onwards
through the wet wriggle, a
flat-out crawl in a bit of water
- wetsuit territory. Luckily,
this wriggle was only one
metre long, and we were back
tramping up the passage in no
time. We ended up in a small
chamber where a climb leads
to a dig - local cavers trying to
extend the system. Bands of
deposited mud on the wall
map the climate going back
thousands of years, a black
band of carbon showing when
the land had been cleared for
farming by prehistoric man
burning trees.
At this point we were about
two hours from the entrance
and it was time to turn
around. The journey back
seemed quicker, even the wet
wriggle appeared easier. Back
at the main tourist cave again,
I wasn't quite ready to leave.
Those of you who have been to
Marble Arch caves will know
that the entrance involves a
boat ride along a canal before
dry land is reached. I couldn't
resist the opportunity to have
a nice long swim in this canal,
with only Hugh in his surfing
wetsuit daring to come with
me.
On the surface, we changed
into our dry clothes quickly as
a light drizzle began to fall.
Although the cave and the hut
were in the North, the quick-
est route between them
involved a brief visit to the
South. We' took advantage of
this to stock up on petrol and
cigarettes, followed by a quick
visit to Frank Eddie's pub
before heading home for a
massive chilli. Needless to
say, another night was spent
sampling Ireland's finest in
McKenzie's.
Sunday morning brought
much better weather - the sun
actually shone! After a rather
lazy breakfast, we quickly
changed into our gear for a
visit to Boho caves - just
across the road from the hut.
Boho caves are a complex
labyrinth of passages in a thin
bedding of limestone. We fol-
lowing the Main Drain, a large
dry passage that quickly fills
to the roof in flood. Our intend-
ed route went north to the
smaller Formation Chamber,
but we found that the connect-
ing passage had been filled to
the roof with mud by a previ-
ous flood. Instead we explored
the short Virgin Circuit, before
heading over to Coolarkin
Cave in the back of Sean's van.
Coolarkin Cave enters the
hillside at the bottom of a fif-
teen metre shakehole. A small
stream enters the shakehole
via a waterfall, and then flows
through the cave. The
entrance is a massive train-
tunnel sized passage - proper
Sunday caving. We followed
this for about two hundred
metres to where an impassa-
ble collapse had occurred.
Various people had tried to dig
their way through, but failed.
The water from the cave
emerges after two kilometres -
a potentially huge system. We
suggested to Sean that he
bring a JCB down to clear the
choke - the cave is certainly
big enough!
After these two brief trips, it
was back to the hut to tidy up,
then up to Sean's house where
his wife had prepared soup for
us. We were on the road by
4:30, reaching Dublin in time
for my 7:30 flight to London.
With great caving, and even
better hospitality, I'm sure
we'll be back in Fermanagh
soon.
