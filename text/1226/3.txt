Student Pugwash
Young people call for a rethink on nation-
al missile defence, tackling the root caus-
es of terrorism, and including ethics i n
education.
Thirty four young people from Britain
and several other countries met for the first
UK Student Pugwash conference at
Wadham College in Oxford on the 15th-
17th of December last year. In the spirit of
Pugwash Conferences on Science and
World Affairs, we discussed issues of glob-
al importance, particularly where science
has an impact on society. These are most-
ly interrelated problems, or otherwise
known as problematiques, caused by
inequities of various sorts (not just materi-
al), as Prof. John Ziman explained in his
talk. Some aspects of World Affairs were
elucidated by General Sir Hugh Beach talk-
ing about the declining role of NATO as a
defence organisation, while becoming
rather more important politically, and the
prospect of eventual Russian membership.
This was contrasted with the weaker and
much less visible OSCE. Sir Timothy
Garden gave a fascinating overview of the
hotspots around the world and the rather
bleak prospects for the coming year; only
the European Union seems to give some
hope to the situation.
Three working groups tackled the issues
of missile defence, terrorism and genetics;
and more details about the conference,
such as the working group reports as well
as the talks, can be found on the website
(see end of article.)
One of the working groups discussed
the potential negative consequences of US
national missile defence. If some sort of
missile defence system is inevitable, a
multilateral (as opposed to US national)
theatre missile defence system was rec-
ommended as an alternative. This issue
will be pursued further and will be taken
up with relevant decision makers.
The working group on terrorism came to
the conclusion that the root causes need to
be tackled. These are usually related to
inequities (part of a problematique), and
often preceeded by an arbitrary division of
people. For the short term, several sugges-
tions were made trying to strike a balance
between security and freedom.
The working group on genetics dis-
cussed genetic discrimination, cloning,
designer babies, xenotransplantations and
GMO. It was agreed that ethics should be
included in education, for example by
introducing courses to teach the tools nec-
essary for ethical analysis and debate.
On the last day the Student conference
joined the British Pugwash meeting at the
Royal Society in London to discuss "The
Answer to Global Warming: A Plague of
Windmills or Nuclear Proliferation?" (very
timely with the government energy review
being due.) Dr. John Hassard pointed out
the threats of global warming and empha-
sized that we should consider the worst
case scenario, as we did in the Cold War,
making a case for putting in just as much
effort and resources. Prof. Jack Harris
explained that nuclear power could 'para-
doxically' help to reduce the threat of pro-
liferation, as stockpiles of highly enriched
uranium can be reduced by using them as
fuel in civil reactors. Prof. Dennis
Anderson, on the other hand, asked the
question 'What's wrong with the alterna-
tives?' and made a strong case for
increased investment in renewable ener-
gies.
This first UK conference was organised
by the Student Pugwash groups at
Imperial College, Oxford and Cambridge,
and generated interest to establish groups
elsewhere as well. If you are interested to
get involved, please feel free to contact us
