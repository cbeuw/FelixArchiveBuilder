GFQQ - The Great Felix Quote Quiz
by Bobby Cyclops & Dr. Hot Fudge
Greetings Fudglings! No of players: 62
I knew this would happen - the Bond quote from issue 1224 has The Leader Board - top 20
caused uproar of the magnitude we first saw when we suggested that Name Score
Uncle Owen was Obi Wan's brother. Two points - firstly The Spy Who Daniel Sauder 85
Loved Me came before Moonraker, and Bond is quoted as saying Anthony Rodriques 79.5
(when discussing Jaw's role as a professional killer to Anya) "His Andrew Ince 78.5
name's Jaws....he kills people". Looking from a chronological point of Simon North 78.5
view, this should be your answer - traditionally in GFQQ if a quote John Anderson 78
appears in more than one film, we take the earlier film as the correct Christopher Dent 74.5
answer. However, as so many of you got it wrong, I will definitely look Chris Ince 74
into the matter and award points only if I am satisfied that the identi- Rebekah Hymas 62.5
cal quote appears in Moonraker. Michael Simonds 62.5
Thanks to Anthony J. Rodrigues for pointing out that Jaws wasn't Arosha Bandara 61
the only henchman not to be killed - Nick Nack (the Man with the Gregory Mann 59.5
Golden Gun) survived his encounter with Bond; at the end of the film, Fred Marquis 58.5
Bond leaves turn suspended within a wicker basket. Baron Samedi, Geoff Lay 58
from Live and Let Die, also isn't killed by Bond. At the end of the film he Kim Randell 58
is seen sitting on the back of the train. Vuk Cerovic 55
Continuing the Specials theme, this week we have a special bumper Chris Toffis 51
edition of Simpson's quotes. This time we want the name of the char- Anthony Meisner 46
acter and the episode the quote is from (a brief description will suffice Rhys & Flo 44
if you don't know the actual name). Hopefully they shouldn't be too Jennifer Williams 43.5
ambiguous this week!! Bobby Cyclops Somsuddin A l i 42.5
