Football VII Triumph
Kings 5ths 4 - 4 IC 7ths
(4-2 to IC 7ths on penalties)
It w a s the game of the season
for IC 7ths - a second round
away cup tie against Kings
5ths, a team i n the league
above us. We knew we had our
work cut out, but we'd been
psyching ourselves up and eat-
ing bananas all week.
We were up against it right
from the start, Kings with a
huge prevailing wind behind
them had us pinned in our own
half for most of the first half.
However, after they scored a
lucky looping lob which Matin
lost in the sun, our spirits were
buoyed when Matt created an
opening for himself on the right
of the box to smash home a
stunning finish into the top-left
corner. Our back line was deal-
ing with their incessant
attacks effectively, but just
before the break they got
another, scrappy goal. 2-1 to
Kings at half time, but IC by no
means out of the fixture with
the wind behind them in the
second half.
Then, to our dismay, Kings
scored 5 minutes into the sec-
ond after Alex gave away a
penalty and Matin w a s unable
save the spot kick. To make
matters worse, Gopal was then
booked for hinting the referee
was either visually challenged
or mentally inadequate.
However, IC's resolve never fal-
tered and after Major Tom put a
free kick into the far comer of
the net to make the score 3-2,
we felt w e could go all the way.
But with 10 minutes to go - dis-
aster! Kings went 4-2 up from a
headed goal. Surely IC couldn't
redress a 2 goal deficit with 10
minutes to go against a team in
a league above them... or could
they....
The fresh legs of Panu were
worrying the edgy Kings
defence. After Matt made a
Netball
IC I 33 - 16 LSE
The netball 1st team is off to a
great start i n the U L U
Challenge Cup, producing a
convincing w i n against LSE.
We were without our usual
keeper Clare, who has a poor-
ly foot as a result of a Reef or 2
mixed with the crazy combi-
nation of a dance floor. Our
other Claire, who can usually
be found flying down the
wing, was our tallest option to
take her place a n d d i d a
valiant job.
We got to off to a great start,
winning the first 2 quarters
easily. Nice dodging in the
centre court between Jess
and Ruth, and fantastic
defence gave the shooters
plenty of opportunities and
they potted most. Defence
was looking particularly great
in this game. Sooz, Kathryn
and Jess made many intercep-
tions and if not, got fingers to
the ball to knock it to one of
the team to get control back.
Stux came on at half time,
whilst LSE made a change in
tactics for the better. Simple
lobs into the shooter and a
better flow through centre
court meant the 3rd quarter
drew at 6 goals each.
Strong attacking i n the 4th
quarter and a final burst of
goals from the IC shooters,
Beckie and Hannah, meant a
good victory to the IC girls on
the 1st stop to winning the
cup final.
superb turn on the edge of the
box to loop the ball across the
face of goal, Panu ran in to head
home from a nigh-on impossi-
ble angle. 4-3 - there was still
hope. Then with 5 minutes to
go IC w o n a corner. Major Tbm
stepped up to take it and pon-
dered the wind blowing into
the goal-mouth. Everyone then
went apoplectic as he hit a
wickedly in-swinging dipping
corner which sailed over the
keeper and straight into the
top right corner of the net to
equalise. 4-4 at full time. Thus,
extra time reared its ugly, lactic
acid-filled head.
For the next half hour, both
teams went all out to fight
against fatigue and get the
vital decider. Some stalwart
defending by Chris and Andy,
throwing themselves at every-
thing spherical i n sight,
ensured we didn't concede.
After 120 minutes of football,
the tie had gone to penalties.
Five plucky lads put them-
selves forward to take the
kicks with IC kicking first. Panu
stepped up and put his penalty
over the bar but was relieved
when his Kings counterpart
did likewise moments later.
Andy then coolly put his kick
into the top right corner and IC
cheered when the next Kings
taker put his wide. Gopal and
Andrea nonchalantly put there
penalties away like it w a s
almost a chore but their Kings
counterparts were also suc-
cessful. 3-2 to IC with one
round to go, if w e scored the
next one w e h a d won. The
Major calmly placed the ball on
the spot and stroked it home
into the top left corner.
Victory for IC 7ths, merriment
ensued and bodily fluids were
exchanged to celebrate the
greatest giant-killing since
Younis Huthhart kicked
Nightshade's arse on
Gladiators.
