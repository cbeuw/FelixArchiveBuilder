Howdly-doodly fudgerinos. I've taken the week off from the crossword
this week as my brain has been drained due to spending the weekend
ogling at the yellow figures in the magical box in my bedroom, and I'm
not talking about my collection of bikini-clad, pygme, custard-wrestlers.
I'm of course referring to our mammoth selection of quotes from the fam-
ily Simpson. A s Bobby C will explain in due course, we want the name
of the character and the name/decription of the episode to collect the
points this week. We feel the Simpson's deserved a special edition all to
themselves as we've spent so much quality time with them over the
years and they manage to deftly take the piss out of almost all the films
we've used so far. I've received no crossword entries this week despite
my threatening words seven days ago, what's the matter with you
freaks? It can't be that hard because I'm not that bloody clever. I mean
it, you punks better start filling in the crossword otherwise when I get
a hold of you, I'm going to use your head for a bucket and paint my house
with your brains!
