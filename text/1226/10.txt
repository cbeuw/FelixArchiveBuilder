Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Alt Mus Soc
Seems a slightly severe
abbreviation for the
Alternating Musketeer
Social-worker, but then
it's not the kind of thing
you normally advertise.
dBs, 5pm-7pm
R 'n' B Night
This can only be an
improvement on its
namesakes, such as
Fish 'n' Chips and
Cannon 'n' Ball. Grease
and no jokes, then?
dBs, 7:30pm
Cheesy Wotsits
1 shot beer, 2 shots
sportsmen, a squeeze of
netball players, 2 plays
of 'It's Raining Men'.
Shake, strain, swallow,
pass out.
dBs, 8pm-lam
D 'n' B Night
This can only be an
improvement on its
namesakes, like Cannon
'n' Ball and R 'n' B. Lots
of jokes about Craig
David, then?
dBs, 7:30pm
Kandy
The sheet I have here
seems to think 'Kandy'
should be capitalised.
Ibiza tunes with a capi-
tal K. A n d progressive
house. Electric curtains?
lCU, 8pm-2am

L a i r y Pooter a n d the

Surreal comedy w i t h a
biology instrument and
Bar-Brady from South
Park. One gets horny,
while the other whim-
pers in the corner.
Rock Star
Erk. Even more unlikely
story about tribute band
singer fronting the real
band for some, I sus-
pect, incredibly con-
trived reason. Maybe it's
his twin?
Domestic Disturbance
No, not your neighbours
shagging of a Sunday
afternoon, but instead
good old John Travolta
singing You're The One
That I Want' on a
karaoke machine.
Monsoon Wedding
Marriage ceremony that
turns into hilarious com-
edy when it starts rain-
ing, and the bride wins a
'wet bridal gown' com-
petition, much to her
future husband's delight.
Rat Race
Oh dear. Zuckers, etc, of
Airplane fame, teaming
up w i t h Mr. Bean to fur-
ther melt the brains of
anyone foolish enough
to w a t c h this tripe.
That'll be me, then.

Faster Pussycat
Well, I assume some
kind of 'homage' to M r
Russ Meyer, and some of
his friends. Perhaps they
play topless, covered in
blood, while screaming.

Hahahahaha. If you like
this lot, you must be
even less cool than me,
and (I can assure you),
that is quite some feat.
Don't do it.
Astoria
Aphex Twin
Beeeeeep. Blip-Wibble.
Squeal. Scary scary
scary. A n d other such. If
you like this music, then
you're a sick little mon-
key. Go on you!
Astoria
A n d You Will Know...
...us by the trail of dead.
Another 'homage' title,
but buggered if I can
remember what it is.
Maybe quite good
music. I don't know.
