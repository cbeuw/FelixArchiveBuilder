Review
"Lively Haynes babbies her way
through her ridiculous neuroses in
an entertaining and uniquely-
skewed routine. Her particularly
peculiar set of phobias (opticians,
deaf rapists, etc) proves a great
source for her offbeat, cynical and
politically incorrect material.
Occassionally the quality dips and
more familiar turf is ploughed, but
overall hers is a class act."
