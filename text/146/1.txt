On March 2nd the I.C. Hockey Club
beat Battersea 1-0 i n the .final of the
U.L. Hockey Cup, thus f u l f i l x i n g the
dream of a Triple Crown f o r I.C.
The previous records of the f i n a l i s t s
suggested an exciting game as indeed i t
was. Battersea had won through the most
d i f f i c u l t half of the draw ana furthermore
had won this championships 5 times i n the
previous 7 years. However I.C. defeated
Battersea 2 - 0 i n the cup l a s t season
and also they .ad scored 15 goal3 i n rea-
ching t h i s ' f i n a l with only 3 goals scored
against.
Thus with many enthusiastic supporters
including a few who knew the rules and a
fine p i t c h the stage was set f o r what
turned out to be the most exciting match
of the major sport f i n a l s .
'. 1 1
From the start I.C. attacked strongly
forcing a short corner which Battersea man-
aged to scramble away. The play swung
down to the other end of the f i e l d where
Battersea were prevented from scoring by
a f i n e clearance by Lenssen i n goal.
I.C. attacked again ana were un-
lucky to score when a fine shot from
DeBroeicert had the goalkeeper beaten
but was stopped by the leg of a
Battersea full-back on the goal l i n e . A
penalty bully was awarded but I.C
to convert.
f a i l e d
Battersea returned to the attack, but
the I.C. defence remained firm, with Jowit
at centre half outstanding. The b a l l con-
tinued to swing from end to end with
defenoes dominating.
I t became apparent that the Battersea
defence were concentrating on the I.C.
l e f t wing which included walker the
University l e f t winger, and consequently
the attack switched to the right and were
able to make more headway. However before
advantage could be ta<ven of this the
whistle blew f o r half-time' with honours
even.
On the resumption Battarsea attacked
and forced a short corner from which the
b a l l was cleared to the I.C. r i g h t wing
where Biiatnagar was master of the s i t u a -
tion and with i n t e l l i g n e t passes put
I.C. back on the offensive. From a
free h i t Bhatnagar took the b a l l along
the Battersea goal line and f l i c k e d i t
into the net from a very acute angle
behind the Battersea goalkeeper who was
expecting a centre.
I.C. then proceeded to tajie control
ana twice had the b a l l i n the net but
each time from an offside position.
Battersea renewed attack with great
vigour forcing several short corners,
however, the I.C. defense held firm* and
with sporadic attacks from the always
dnagerous I.C. forwards the one goal lead
was maintained to the end.
The club wishes to thank the Southern
Counties Umpires f o r their handling of
the match the U.L. groundsman f o r : r o v -
i d i n g such a fine p i t c h and above a l l
the many I.C. supporters without whom the
game might w e l l have been lost.

TRIPLE CROWN.
By winning the U.L.U. Hockey Cup,I.C.
have won the T r i p l e Crown. But that i s
not a l l . The sporting triumphs of t h i s
session have 'been phenomenal, and i t i s
d i f f i c u l t to see any other college ever
emulating t h i s f e a t . Apart from the three
major trophies,the Swimming Club has won.
U.L.U. Water Polo League f i r s t , d i v i s i o n

i s a formidable l i s t of wins. Never
before has one college wen. a l l three
major competitions.
The reasons f o r t h i s s e r i e s of
•victories: are not f a r t o 3eek. The

keenness and a b i l i t y i n the f i r s t ' teams
and club s p i r i t i n the l a s t teams a l l
played t h * i r part. The triumphs o f any.
college f i r s t team belong t o the B 3 XV

in fact the whole club contributes to
any f i r s t team victory. I t gives me
great pleasure to say:
