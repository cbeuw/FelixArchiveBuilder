During the past fornight, the West
End has seen the opening of two musicals.
"Aatch I t Sailor" at the Aldwyoh theatre
and also "Pings Ain't Wot they Used T1
be"
which has been transferred from Stratford
to the Garrick.
If the audience reception i s anything
to go by, then "watch I t S a i l o r " i s going
to have a very profitable run indeed.
P h i l i p King ana Falkland Cary have written
this new show to act as a direct sequel
to their last p r o l i f i c success " S a i l o r
Beware".
Perhaps a certain amount of the
interest i n the production l i e s i n i t s
surprise value. Those contented v i s i t o r s
to " S a i l o r Beware" who went home and slept
easily with the knowledge that Albert and
Shirley got safely married as the curtain
dropped have now been rudely awakened.
Even at the end of Part I I they have s t i l l
not entered into the sacred state of wed-
lock, but maybe a t h i r d instalment w i l l
change a l l t h i s . As f a r as one can see,
the cast of "Watch I t Sailor" i s almost
identical to the one used by i t s predecessor,
The only major change i s the substitution
of Kathleen Harrison f o r Peggy Mount i n
the a l l important part of the f r a n t i c a l l y
impossible Emma. Because of obvious phy-
s i c a l difference, the character of Emma
is greatly changed by this, but i t i s
nevertheless quite a f i n e w e l l balanced
performance.
"Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'be" has
received a muoh rougher reception than
might have been expected by many people.
The truth i s though that the play i s rather
badly'thrown together' and i t i s only i t s
rather endearing charm and easy good nat-
ure that makes i t at a l l acceptable. I t
i3 also helped very much by L i o n e l Barts
l i v e l y l y r i c s anu songs which w i l l cert-
ainly stand a second hearing. Surely
the t i t l e song must have d i f f u s e d into
a l l lovers of peace by now. Glynn
Edwards, James Booth, Wallas Eaton,
Barbara Windsor and Edward Caddick as
members of the Soho gambling den, a l l
help the show along with a good deal of
verve and gusto. Joan Littlewood pro-
duces.

This was one of the usual Grantz
package shows, presenting E l l a F i t z -
gerald backed by Paul Smith, the Jimmy
Guiffre t r i o , Roy Eldridge and the Paul
Smith ulaartet, and Shelly Manne and h i s
The programme commenced with Paul
Smith piano, Roy Eldridge trumpet, W i l f r e d
Middlebrooks bass, and Gus Johnson drums.
This group swung right from the s t a r t ,
with a moody interpretation of 'Bernies
Tune', with some superb muted trumpet
from Eldridge. However, they didn't
r e a l l y warm up u n t i l the second number,
a 12-bar up-tempo blues, with Johnson
completely relaxed and combining w e l l
with Smith, (at times there seemed to be
a complete understanding) and Eldridge
seemingly trying t o reach the roof with
a f i n e aerobatic open trumpet.
Paul Smith on piano was the most
exciting sound I have heard since Garner,
his technique was fantastic. I n one
phrase he would be playing an immaculate
c l a s s i c a l chordal progression, and i n the
next few bars would switch to a swinging
jazz-3tyle phrase, interspersed with an
unbelievable number of quotes. The
group finished with an unannounced o r i g -
i n a l .
The Jimmy Guiffre T r i o appeared
next consisting of Guiffe on c l a r i n e t
and tenor sax;., Jim H a l l g u i t a r and
Middlebrooks bass. Guiffre's tone on
both instruments was very breathy, while
the balance of the whole group was
excellent. However, the t o t a l volume o f
the group was more suited f o r a night-
club, and the sound of the group was
rather lost i n the h a l l . The t r i o
commenced with 'Mac the Knife', went i n t o
'My Funny Valentine', and finished up .
with a Guiffre o r i g i n a l , 'Two for Tim-
bucktoo' rather reminiscent of h i s ,
'Train and the River'.
Shelly Manne and his Men featured
Marine on drums, Russ Freeman on piano
Monty Budwig bass, Joe Gordon trumpet,
Richie Kamuca tenor saxophone. The
group commenced with 'Taboo', and i t was
immediately evident that Manne takes a
long time to warm up to where he swings
as much as he does on his records.
'I've grown accustomed to her Face',
was featured by 'The Friends' i n which
Freeman struck me as being much l e s s
impressive than on record. 'Vamps
Blues', an o r i g i n a l by Charlie Mariano,
finished the set.
Did Manne's showmanship
detract from an appreciation of his
drumming? Personally speaking we don't
think so, although you may disagree w i t h
us. A= f a r as inherent swing was

concerned he was rather over-shadcr.vsd
by Gus Johnson, who was*serenely relaxed.
Manne, however, was the other extreme,
his technique to me was b r i l l i a n t (as
denotes the world's top d r u m e r l ) and
his musical taste supreme. I was
rather surprised, however, by the legion
of faces with which he accompanied him-
s e l f . He seemed over-tensed t o the
extreme of neurosis.
INTERVAL
The second h a l f of the show was
devoted e n t i r e l y t o a succession of tunes
by the one and only E l l a Fitzgerald,
y u i e t l y confident, she star-ted with a
moving version of 'S'wonderful',
immaculately backed by the Pe.ul Smith
T r i o , with Jim H.all on guitar, Her
other songs included a mournful 'Misty',
aihumorous ' I t ' s Too Darn Hot', and 'I've
Got the World on a S t r i n g ' . She sang
superbly and swung s o l i d l y ( l ) f o r
f o r t y minutes. The ovation was tremend-
ous, and for her encore she sang an up-
tempo 12-bar v/ith fabulous s c a t t i n g
with quotes which had her audience roar-
ing with delight and approval. A f t e r
she had taken her l a s t c a l l the crowd
s t i l l roared on, only to be silenced by
Grantz' quiet annoiirioement, that he hoped
we had enjoyed the show, and hoped t o see
us again a t the next show.
