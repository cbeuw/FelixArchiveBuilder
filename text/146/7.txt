The Rector1
3 Cup Competition was
contested with the usual enthusiam and
energy on Friday February 26th,, and
after twenty three bouts U.S.M. emerged
the sinners. However i t should be re-
corded, by a f a i r l y impartial C. i G,
observer, that R.C.S. with the smallest
number of Boxers, were unlucky to be
beaten by the Mines masses, several of
whom gained valuable points without
entering the ring.
The best boxer of the evening was
judged t o be Heinrioh Linde, a postgrad-
uate from R.C.S. who gained his exper-
ience boxing f o r 3asle University
Switaerland. heinrioh c l e v e r l y oeat
three tough apponents to win the litrht-
middleweight class, whereas another
postgraduate boxer from R.C.3., Pierre
Sribbribadah, found no one i n the f l y -
weight d i v i s i o n against whom to demon-
strate the s k i l l he has shown when box-
ing f o r U.L.
Tim Burns, of R. S.M., was awarded
the Cup f o r the Best Loser f o r his bout
against A.vJiegington ^G.&G.), a very
tough heavy-weight from the wrestling
world. This Cup was very generously
presented by C.C. oeaford Esq. the
President of I.C. Boxing Club. I t was
unfortunate that the heavyweight f i n a l ,
which promised to be an excellent Oout
between two very strong men, did not take
place as Wiggington had to scratch a f t e r
Tim Burns ( t a c t i c a l l y ; presented him with
a badly bruised eye i n the semi-final.
Thus John "'airfield (ii.S.K.) won on a
walk-over.
Another very good oout was between
the s t i l i s h Lionel ..iiliams" i.G'-^.G.; and
G. Booth of S.i.K., the l a t t e r ~oin;< on
to beat LicK Lance (C. :.G.) i n the f i n a l ,
It was unfortunate that Dave ^aulkener
was not able to demonstrate his h.0.
l e f t hook i n this d i v i s i o n on b e h i l f of
Guilds, as he has done to l.otable effect
in previous years, but the U.L. ooccer
F i n a l was to be held the following day.
The middle and li«ht-heavywei s
»
h
t
f i n a l s were ;..onopolised .by C.s.L-.and
R.C.'S. respectively, ana the two college
captains f i t t i n g l y became winners, though
Vernon larker was ungentlei.anxy enough
to fv.0. his fellow s c i e n t i s t .
For a successful evening's boxing
the thanks of the club are due to
J. Henry Esq., Vice-iresieent, f o r his
liason with the A.3.4., and to she four
seconds who iaboureu unceasinrly i n the
comers.

12th Annual Hyde Park Road Relay.
On the 27th of February, 402 runners
representing 67 teams congregated a t I.C.
to compete i n the Hyde Park road relay,
the fine day promised a^ f a s t , exciting
race and a chance that one or both r e c -
ords might be broken. The many spectat-
ors were not disappointed.
Lap 1.
At the start a l l the teams were
together. This arrangement was unpop-
ular and there was an u n o f f i c i a l
movement by the competitors t o change
the situation, the the s t a r t e r Mr K.W.
Ludlam armed with a .33 single action
p i s t o l and a whistle soon had them under
control. The race sta ted at 3-l i
5 p.m.
By Hyde Park Corner Tony Larkum of
IC was i n the lead closely followed by
the rest of the f i e l d . At Marble Arch
J.Blythe (Pembroke Cambridge) had taken
over and he was being t r a i l e d by
D.Davies (Birmingham) and S.Ducksworth
(Leeds).
The l a p ended with Pembroke i n the
lead followed by Leeds, Durham ..nd RUA
Sandhurst with IC 19th.
Fastest time T.Blythe 13m 24secs. A
fast l a p but confused. Many of the
smaller colleges, with fewer good runn-
ers had obviously raced t h e i r best men
f i r s t .
Lap 2.
By Hyde Park Corner Shirley had put
Durham into 1st place, which position
they held f o r the rest of the race. A
f i n e run by Leake p u l l e d Loughboro from
11th t o 2nd and an equally f i n e run by
M.Barber pulled IC from 19th t o 9th.
Positions at the end of the l a p were
1st Durham, 2ud Lougiiboro, 3rd1
L eds, 4 t h
Birmingham, 5th H u l l , ''th Manchester, °th
IC.
Fastest time P. Leake (l.ou;jii>oro' 13m 20
sees. Durham knew where they were going
and Loughboro thought they d i d .
Lap 3«
L i t t l e change, a fine run by A.
Fruin brought Pembroke into sight again
i n 3rd position but they soon faded
away.
Positions a t the end of the lap were
Durham, Loughboro, Pembroke, Leeds,
Birmingham, Manchester and J.Bernard had
brought IC into 8th position.
Fastest time D.Turner „ueens (Cambridge)
13m 01 sees. This man should never miss
a bus.
Lap 4.
Consistent running began
to t e l l and P.Livesley (Manchester) and
J.Conway (IC) began t o climb up amongst
the leaders. But wait, panting hotly
down IC's neck were H.Kinshall (Selwyn)
having fought up from 21st t o 7th and A.
Wood (St Catherines Oxon) having moved
from 27th t o 8th.
Fastest time A.Wood 12m 32secs (record)
H.Minshall 12m 44secs.
These boys would not need a bus.
Lap 5«
Among the leaders the f i e l d remained
constant except for- J.Cleator IC moving
into 5th place. Lap positions were
Durham, Loughboro, Birmingham, Manchester
IC and LeedSo
Fastest time J.Lee (Manchester) 13m 1
32secs. An uneventful l a p t h i s one,
teams obviously preparing f o r a f i n a l
e f f o r t , gave the spectators a choice t o
. recover.
Lap 6.
A.Jordan (Durham) waltzed round t o
f i n i s h comfortably ahead of A.HH1 who
had brought Manchester through t o 2nd
place. Thus Durham won the S i r Roderic
H i l l Cup i n a record time of 8lm32secs.
J.Collins running as i f the d e v i l were
a f t e r him ( i n fact i t was only B. Tulloh
brought IC i n 4th. Tulloh out f o r an
afternoon s t r o l l gained two plaoes t o
bring Selwyn (Cambridge) i n 5th to win
the IC Union Cup.
F i n a l P o s i t i o n s : -
1.Durham
2. Manchester
3. Loughboro
4.IC
5.Selwyn College, Cambridge
6 »B irmingham.
Fastest time f o r the f i n a l l a p B. Tulloh
12m 39secs equalling;... liymari's 1958
reoord. For the f i r s t time two teams
had a l l t h e i r runners lap i n tinder 14mins
They were Durham, who a f t e r the f i r s t lap
never looked as though they would be
beaten, and Manchester. The nearest
that anyone had approached t h i s feat
previously was i n 1958 when Liverpool had
a l l but one man under 14 mins and IC had
two men on 14mins.
The winners of the wooden spoon were
Westminster College, Oxford. While l a s t
year's winners NCL were 41 St. Borough
Road 17th ( l a s t year 49th) were the 2nd
London College home, and' Keble College
(Oxon) were 29th after loosing G»Kales
(2nd fastest time 1959) an improvement of
26 positions over l a s t year.
The f i e l d , o f 66 teams was not as
large as f i r s t expected but of the 75
teams expressing a desire t o race, 8 d i d
not return t h e i r applications o r inform
the organisers that they would not comp-
ete. This example of bad manners pre-
cluded the sending of applications t o
teams who desired to run but were not
invited because i t was f e l t the f i e l d had
reached the optimum number. I n the
future the organisers f e e l that i t would
be good p o l i c y t o accept a l l applications
to run as i t seens l i k e l y from t h i s year's
experience that the race has reached i t 3
maximum size.
Apart from t h i s , the afternoon's
entertainment was very successful and our
thanks should go t o the organisers D.Feam
and h i s assistant C. James who with t h e i r
team o f helpers from the cross country
club a.nd the UL 0TC, succeeded i n making
this event one that IC should be pro. id
of. We should also express our regards
to La. iy H i l l vmo each year graces the
meeting with her presence and the Rector
who, with his interest i n student
a c t i v i t i e s , I f e e l sure would be
d i f f i c u l t t o prevent from attending.
This r"ce i s as much a s o c i a l event
for the competitors as an a t h l e t i c one
and a most successful hop was organised
i n the evening by the cross country and
a t h l e t i c clubs.
