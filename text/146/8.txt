For the 3eoond year i n succession
the U.L. Association Football Challenge
Cup has returned to i t s r i g h t f u l home at
I.C. On Saturday, Feb. 27th. at Hotspur
lark the I.C. XI retained the Cup with
a very close 2 - 1 win over Goldsmiths
College. The path to the f i n a l , easy at
f i r s t but very d i f f i c u l t later has a l -
ready been l a v i s h l y described i n e a r l i e r
F e l i c i but having disposed of L.S.E.
and U.C. the I.C. team went into the
f i n a l firm favourites to win the Cup.
Goldsmiths, possibly as a r e s u l t of sound
advice by Jimmy Clarkson, were determined
not to l e t us get away with i t so easily
and were out to knock us off our game by
f i e r c e tackling and tight marking.
However, l i k e a l l good story t e l l e r s
we w i l l start at the beginning with the
rash of h o r r i f i o a l l y coloured posters
and loudspeaker announcements which
heralded the f i n a l match. The attract -
ions of an afternoon l i s t e n i n g to the
I.C. Traditional Jazz Band plus an unint-
errupted view of Jezebel plus an hour
and a half of s c i n t i l l a t i n g f o o t b a l l
played by technicolour teams, plus the
opportunity to get themselves filmed by
the I.C. Soccer Club cine camera was
obviously too much f o r about four score
and ten vociferous supporters who trav-
e l l e d to the wilds of Motspur t e r r i t o r y
to witness the great battle and cheer on
their own champions. The Goldsmiths army
was even stroneer numerically but having
fewer bass voices and many more contral-
tos a new 1st law of sound became
apparent i.e.-:volume i s inversely pro-
portional to numbers.
The teams changed with the music
of that pleasant old English f o l k song
"Why are we waiting" ringing i n their
ears and eventually marched out to a thun-
derous ovation. Both sides were then ^
presented to the Warden of the U.L. Union
Mr. D.J.Warden M.C.,M.A. and the Officers
of the U.L.A.F.C.
Soon after the Rational Anthem Gold-
smiths kicked off with what l i t t l e wind
there was and the sun against them. The
game was swinging rapidly from end to end
i n the f i r s t ten minutes but with the I.C.
attacks having more penetration. Max
Finney went close with a couple of runs
only to put his shots into the side net-
ting while Dave iowell was a constant
danger on the Goldsmith1
s right wing.
However, 3as>.James was playing his usual
s o l i d game i n the middle, and a l t ough
Goldsmiths told their big centre forward
to bustle him into mistakes, no danger
came from this quarter. She I.C. team
generally were a l i t t l e on edge and not
playing with the smooth rhythm of former
game3. Goldsmiths took advantage of
this i n t h e i r pj.an of campaign and tack-
led very quickly so as to prevent us from
playing the match-winning f o o t b a l l v<hich
brought I.C. into the f i n a l . After
several I.C. attacks, a long b a l l down
the middle l e f t the Goldsmith's forward
with a clear run i n and shot, but he
veered away to the right and gave Steve
Pick the chance to cover and make a good
tackle to save the situation. Just
after this came the f i r s t b i g t h r i l l of
the match, when a Finney header with
'goal' written a l l over i t was handled
over the bar by a Goldsmith defender
James came up to take the penalty kick,
and amidst a great hush h i t the b a l l hard
and f a s t two feet outside the past.
After t h i s l e t - o f f Goldsmiths played
harder than ever, cheered on by their
enthusiastic supporters, who were
inevitably drowned by the organised
cheering of the I.C.contingent. So the
game continued at ding-dong pace u n t i l
half time, when I.C. went into the
dressing-room a much chastened team to
f i n d the score s t i l l 0-0, instead of the
3-0 lead which had been expected.
The half time pep-talk perhaps had
some effect, because not long a f t e r the
restart Dave Coups banged i n a good old-
fashioned shot that r e a l l y made the net
bulge.
More pressure by I.C. l e d to another
goal from Dave Coups at centre-forward,
following some good grafting by the
forward l i n e , and Colin Harris was very
unlucky with a c a r e f u l l y aimed f u l l -
blooded volley, which went just outside
the post.
Soon a f t e r this I.C. was awarded yet
another penalty, and penalty-king Max
Finney trotted up to take the kick.
With a deceptive run-up he sent the goal
keeper and a i l the photographers going
the wrong way, and cunningly slipped the
b a l l just outside the other goalpost,
l e t another penalty miss, but now I.C.
was two goals up, and ready to score some
more.
However, Goldsmiths was not finished
and fought back f i e r c e l y with Dave
Newin bringing the b a l l through from
right-half and Dave l o w e l l their right-
winger turning up on the l e f t wing and
at centre-forward and anywhere else
where the b a l l happened to be.
This perseverance paid off soon when
l o w e l l from the centre-forward
position lofted the b a l l over the
crowded I.C. defence into the back of
the net. I.C. at this time were over-
confident and held the b a l l too long
instead of beating the quick tackling
Goldsmith's defence, by push-and-run
f:.otball.
After forcing a corner which was
quickly cleared the Goldsmith side seemed
to have shot their bolts, and I.C. pounded
on to a hard earned and s o l i d , i f not very
b r i l l i a n t win. having collected the Cup
and medals from Mr Warden, the jubilant
team rushed o f f to crack a bottle of
champagne i n the dressing room before
proceeding to the r e a l celebration of the
evening. The bar, the concert h a l l , the
hostel, and a certain place i n Hammersmith
W.6. noticed a certain joyfulness among
the soccer club during the evening and
the new German boot and the Cup circulated
f u r i o u s l y i n the bar. Several people
actually went to bed, but at least two
persons managed to l a s t out u n t i l 11.30
the following morning. So the celebrat-
ions f i n i s h f o r this year, and now we look
forward to equal efforts and equal
success next year.

Friday, February 27th. saw the
f i r s t and second VTII's setting off on
a high tide f o r Staines although their
immediate destination was only the
Lensbury Club, 11 miles 'upstream. At
t h i s stage the 2nd. VXII, who had been
very unsettled by changes i n the crew,
were very unsure of themselves and were
completely unable to compete with the
1st. VIII i n speed. Consequently they
made their own way to Lensbury staying
w e l l up i n front of the other crew who
were receiiiing a l o t of coaching from
the launch.
Meeting on Saturday again at Lensbury
the crews set off into a s t i f f headwind
and a very fast stream running down making
progress very hard work. The two VTIIs
did not see much of each other before
lunch at Walton but the lower boat was
improving even then. After lunch the
two crews met on l e v e l terms f o r the
f i r s t t i m e and the 2nd VIII were able
to hold the f i r s t VIII over a stretoh
of half a mile t r a v e l l i n g at the same
rate, something which seemed impossible
even two days e a r l i e r . Late that
afternoon great fun was had by this crew
for they were swept onto the bank three
times while negotiating the sharp up-
r i v e r bends, h i t several overhanging trees
and eventually s l i d t o a gentle stop on a
submerged grassy bank, afterwards f l o a t i n g
off leaving bowman, Mike Craig, standing
f o r l c l y up to his knees i n water. How-
ever, these things over, the crew got to-
gether muchbetter and just before Staines
was paddling n i c e l y ahead of the 1st VIII
and two Staines crews without too much
effort.
Coming back on ounday both crews were
paddling b e t t e r and rowing with the stream
made l i f e very much easier. Lunch at
Walton and tea at Richmond l e f t the crews
in fine form f o r the Head course. The
1st VTII paddling at 25-26 did the fast
time of 19 mins. 30 sees, but the 2nd V I I I
who had a s tart of 30 seconds rowed over
in 19 mins. 15 sec3. much to t h e i r s a t i s -
f a c t i o n .
Both crews are rowing i n the Reading
Head of the River this Saturday togetner
with the 3rd VTII over a two and a half
mile course and hopes of a good performance
are running high.
Congratulations to the „ockey Club
on completing the Triple f o r us. Now
we have the Dinner to look forward to,
assuming that Union finances can take i t .
