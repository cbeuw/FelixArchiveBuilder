Shrove Tuesday dawned bright and
f a i r , but the promise of that b r i g h t
morning was not, alas, to be f u l f i l l e d .
As i s the case so often, 'the best l a i d
pland of mioe and men, gang a f t a
pancake'. >md so i t was that Les iOLlen
led his men forth under threatening skies,
while i n the d i s t nee an obligato on a
muted eccles cake was heard, and taken
as an i l l omen by the augurs.
The recently engaged Preside it of
ICWA, engaging her gears i n an engaging
fashion, engaged to do b a t t l e . This
engagement was made before the engagement
so to speak. In fact they enga-ed to
run fiorster"
At the gun, Les ran f i r s t just as
Jolyon Nove came fourth i n a f i f t h rate
square fashion. Round the obloig they
c i r c l e d and then the sides were onened
and the rains came v e r t i c a l l y . A
horizontal sprint i n a counter clockwise
direction produced a lead.
I t was at t h i s point that .Tolyon1
s
towel was shown i n i t s true colours.
The executive never l o s t t h e i r lead,
and the dog i s reported to have rabies.
But as Les A l l e n was not heard to remark,
" I f you wish to win i n the Olympic Games,
become a Russian."

On the l a s t day of February a new
series of japerbacxc books was introduced
Onto the B r i t i s h market.
This series has long been popular
in America among students and i n t e l l i -
gent laymen d^e to i t s choice of sub-
jects aimed at the more discriminating
reader.
Galaxy BOOKS have opened tneir
series i n this country with such admir-
able "vvorKS a3 Bertrand Russell's "Irob-
lems of 1hilosophy*', Max Weber' 3 "ftssays
on Sociology" and C,_S. Lewis's "Allesrory
of Love".
however, dae to the fact that they
are printed i n America they are rather
ni.'h priced. jiut the almost prohibi-
tive vrice f o r r
. aperbaevs i s overcome
by their subject matter.
As the problems ana struggles of
integration seen to be i n the forefront
of the news at the present time and
appear to be of general interest to most
people, 'The Strange Career of Jim Grow'
by C. Vann Woodward ^price has been
chosen from this new series.
Segregation i s only the latest phrase
in the long hi tory of the white man's
ways of f i x i n g the Negroe's status or 'his
T lace i n s o c i e t y 1
. In e a r l i e r h.-.rsher
times bondage ana limited servitude have
been used. Slavery* peonage and abortive
types of apprenticeship have also had
t h e i r day. Exploitation of the Negro
by the white man goes bacK to the
beginning of relations between the races
and so do race c o n f l i c t b r u t a l i t y and
i n j u s t i c e .
Along with these practices, the
assumptions of Kegro i n f e r i o r i t y and
white superiority have also developed
and prospered. These assumptions
are the basis of segregation as we
know i t and so i t can be concluded that
the whole of this p a r t i c u l a r modern race
hatred i.as i t s origins i n the remote per-
iod of negro slavery.
This book is a concise ana revealing
account of the development of segregation
following the withdrawal of trie :<\dera-
tion troops from the Southern States of
America in 1377 up to the present day.
This period of history which i s s t i l l ,
covered by a f a i r l y thick cloak of
obscurity, during which the 'Jim Crow1
system ofsegregation came about i s
dealt with quite f u l l y i n an easily
understandable way, giving one a com-
plete view of the problems involved.
The booK has been made up from a
series of iectures given at the Univ-
e r s i t y of V i r g i n i a i n 1934 and has since
been brought up to date. The lectures
were given to an u«*e#F>ated audience
and were received with acclaim from
both 'sides'.
l.r. Vann Woodward was born i n
Arkansas and i s now Ixofessor of
History at the John Hopkins Jniversity.
He has l i v e d i n the South a l l his l i f e
and i s p a r t i c u l a r l y interested i n the
problems of segregation.
he is also the author of three
other booKS on the same subject; Tom
Viatoon, Reunion and Reaction, and
Origins of -he hew South.
This book should be read by any-
one who is at a l l interested i n the
subject of segregation. I t i s a well-
balanced survey bringing f o r t h each
r.hase of the race relations of the
southern states with c l a r i t y , emphasising
the importance of the p o l i t i c a l , econ-
omic and s o c i a l conditions of the time,
by a well Known authority who has had
a wide experience of i t s exploitation
and effect.

the general American ne^ro, s i m i l a r to
Uncle Sam. ' Derivation unknown).
