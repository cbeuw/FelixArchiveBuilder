How does one Judge success? In a
m a t e r i a l i s t i c world i t i s inevitable
that success i s primarily.based on
m a t e r i a l i s t i c standards. And^et inside
each of us there i s an inner 3et of
s p i r i t u a l values whioh contributes an
important part of that i n t e g r a l we o a l l
success. We therefore impose c e r t a i n
oonditions angTprTnciples .in pur minds.
We s e t a l i m i t . We choose a l i m i t , the
height" of whioh depends on our individu-
a l personality, but below which our
integral sense of values and proportion
w i l l not permit us to go however great
the material sense of success that
awaits us there. L i f e i s tolerable only
i f we f i r s t achieve success w i t h i n
ourselves. M a t e r i a l i s t i c success, then
elevates l i f e from being usually t o l e -
rable to varying degrees of pleasantness;
So says Mr. C l i f f o r d Odets whose
play "The B i g Knife" i s based on t h i s
theme.
Charlis.Castle i s a renowned
Hollywood movie s t a r and Hoff Federa-
ted' s biggest box o f f i c e draw. He i s
r i c h , handsome, charming and i n t e l l i -
gent. But he has reached the height of
his career by s a c r i f i c i n g his i n t e g r i t y ,
stooping beneath the ' l i n e ' , and'sinning
against h i s own nature', h i s conscience
does not allow him to compromise the
person that he was with the person that
he i s . Nor can he reconcile both h i s
wife, whom he loves, and the whole of
the movie industry, with i t s producers,
tycoons and businessmen, who a l l bring
pressure to bear on him- to move him i n
the opposite direction.
What i s the solution? C l i f f o r d
Odets suggests that i t needs a materi-
a l i s t i c act of tragedy to wrest success
from f a i l u r e and to redeem that dignity
and s e l f respect necessary to l i v e with
oneself.
The Play i t s e l f i s set against a
Hollywood background i n a t y p i c a l
Beverley H i l l House - large, luxurious
and modern, f u l l y equiped with swimming
pool and tennis courts. The people,
again are those that can be found only
i n Hollywood, colourful, larger than
l i f e , unscrupulous and immoral.
Although the topic of the play i s
a serious one, the dialogue, handled by
C l i f f o r d Odets with h i s usual s k i l l ,
i s always f a s t moving i n the smart,
wise-cracking, American jargony way.

The IC art club held i t s annual ex-
h i b i t i o n l a s t week, and the technical
quality of the paintings and drawings
was high.
Some of the exhibits were extremely
clever and some I couldn't understand at
a l l . To single out any one outstanding
painting would be d i f f i c u l t and not
r e a l l y significant,since any such choice
i n necessarily personal. But a few re
remarks are i n order I think, since some
members of the union seem to regard
people who paint or draw as strange
people who wear long woolen underwear
and eat nut cutlets f o r breakfast.
I t would appear that anyone who
t r i e s to express themselves by pan or
brush i s l i k e l y to be held i n contempt
as a 'pseudo-intellectual', or a 'nut-
case' • I would l i k e to make a plea f o r
a more l i b e r a l a t t i t u d e to the college
a r t i s t s and a r e a l i s a t i o n that a rugby
player may possibly be able to paint.

I t was a Friday morning, I remem-
ber, cold and wet. The 4-9 bus was full
to capacity, and I sat amid a smell of
tobacco smoKe ana drying raincoats, my
brief case on my knees and my umbrella
looking rather g u i l t y i n i t s small pool
of water. There was nothing extra-
ordinary about the journey that morning.
A smart blonde coiffure i n the seat i n
front proved superior to i t s wearer
when she went downstairs. The conduc-
tor muttered something when I tendered
a pound note f o r a 7d. fare. No, I
hadn't got the penny.
At South Kensington, I jumped off
the bus at the zebra crossing as usual
and hurried through the d r i z ; l e into
the station arcade. There, pausing to
f o l d my umbrella, I saw him. He was
at the bookstall. I don't know why
he should have caught my attention,
but something i n his manner prompted me
to study him f u r t h e r .
Somehow he didn't f i t into any of
the standard groups one sees at such
s t a l l s . His was not the pimpled
schoolboy approach with the so obvious
attempted casualnness while f u r t i v e l y
"reading" the semipornographic " a r t "
publications. Nor yet was he the
fellow who stands f o r hours with the
one magazine, apparently undecided
but i n actual fact reading i t from
cover to cover. And he was d e f i n i t e l y
not the about-to-go-on-a-long-journey-
oan-you-suggest-a-book-kind.
Yes, here was something new. I
paused to observe.
As f a r as I could see, he was
undecided as to which of two publica-
tions he should buy. Intrigued, I
went neater. S t i l l he looked from
one to the other, hesitating. By
now I was so fascinated that I had
to discover the cause of his quandary
I edged nearer, looking over h i s
shoulder. As I did so, he made his
decision, paid his money and picked up
the "Weekend Mail" i n preference to
the "Times Literary Supplement".

RUGBY FIVES
The Rugby Fives Club waa formed on
Monday Heb. 15th. as a subsidiary of the
Squash Club. Elected to o f f i c e were :
Secretary ; John Carter; Captain : John
Galley. The courts, as yet unfinished,
are situated opposite Weekea H a l l bet -
ween the tennis courts and the road.
The game f o r the u n i n i t i a t e d can be
played by two or four persons, the b a l l ,
hard and leather covered with a bounce
almost on a par with a golf b a l l , i s h i t
with the gloved hand - w e l l paddedl
Basically, the rules are s i m i l a r to oth-
er court games, a player being conceded
a point only when he wins his service.
To serve, the 3erver stands i n the right
hand front corner (or the l e f t one i f he
i s l e f t handed) and throws the b a l l ,
generally underarm, against the front
w a l l i n such a way that i t w i l l then h i t
the side w a l l and bounce where i t can
be h i t back to the side w a l l , front w a l l
and over to the receiver i n the other ,
half of the court. Battle then commenc-
es u n t i l the b a l l goes out of play ( un-
der the bar on the front w a l l or out of
court).
Fives i s rather a polymorphic game,
due mainly to the r e l a t i v e l y few people
who play the game. Rugby f i v e s i s the
commoner with Eton f i v e s (ho back wall)
and Winchester fives (with a number of
buttresses scattered about just to make
things awkward) also played i n 3ome
parts of t he country, mainly i n the
schools. For those who would l i k e to
have a bash the club w i l l be purchasing
a number of gloves and b a l l s which w i l l
be available.

Unfortunately the club lias been h i t
by a high percentage of injury Jhese l a s t
few weeks, which has caused one or two
games to b,; cancelled. Such noteabxe
characters as Tom Banks (broxe:. nose)
and Tom King, our secretary, (broken
wrist) are our most recent casualties.
However t . i s lias not prevented the
other teams -from continuing their
winning way.
Since the Cup F i n a l , the f i r s t XV
has played two games. On 2/th Feb. i t
travelled to Cambridge and won by 8 pts.
to 3 with a weakened side over a St.
Cats. team. Last Saturday the convin-
cingly beat a University Vandals side
by if t r i e s to a penalty goal. The
forwards? played excellently winning most
of the set scrums and they were ably
supported by a bac^ a i v i s i o n which had
been promoted from the Ex 1st.
Jeff Connor's Ex 1st last Saturday'
ousted Tom King's A XV from the position
of being the highest scoring team i n a
single game. This feat was accomplished
with a 58 pts. to 3 win over University
Vandals. I r o n i c a l l y the Vandals scored
f i r s t , but i t was not long before Froggett
at outside half oad c o l l e c t e d a hat-trick
of t r i e s and J . Connor had kicked a double
hat-trick of goals f o r the I.C. team. This
win means that they are the third I.C. team
to top the 50 pts. mark i n one game.
Previously the Ex A XV i n t h e i r f i r s t match
6£ the season won 30 pts. to 0, and the
A XV has beaten the l o r t of London Author-
i t y 'A' by 53 pts. to 0.
Another of I.C. teams l i v e l y to run
up such a score before the end of the sea-
son i s the B I I I XV. This team goes
from strength to strength with a win from
their last meeting against U.C.H. l e l i c a n s
by 25 pts. to 6. This i s a team of a l l
talents having people i n i t who have c o l -
ours f o r hockey (2), rowing, fencing, golf,
judo and swimming. Their proud boast i s
- ''">' 11 play anyone at anything - and
lose".
On c l o s i n g these short notes the Club
would l i k e to thank a l l these people who
crave their time and energy to ma*.e the
I.C. Rugger Lance sacn a success.
