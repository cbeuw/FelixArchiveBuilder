I 8im back to front. That i s t o
say, I am hack to front anything with a
front worth backing. Now I am back at
the 'front'. 'I must, without affront,
get back i s front - not being taken
abaok by being confronted with a look
back at the GoLDEN (or yellow) front
AGE.
I have not wasted my month i n
bed. This meditated mumble w i l l be
the flashback frontispiece to my newly
launched series of Back-to-Eront
paper-backs, the OSTRICH series. The
b i r d of the same name also uses i t s
back to front. Fly-paper w i l l not be
used because i t cannot be stressed enough
that both the series and the b i r d of
the same name are as sensitive as the
aeronautical engineers to their i n -
a b i l i t y t o f l y . Note that the axiom,
(long believed to be associated with
engineers, the new series, and the b i r d
of the same name) "Birds of an
Ostrich feather flock together."
(often found abbreviated or not at a l l )
was earnt by the birds alone and net
the engineers or the series, of the
same name. Apparently, exploited
odtriches do t h i s to keep their bottoms
warm. Have yoo b. chance any hats
decorated with feathers of the same name?
Hats that you have not sent to S i r
John Wolfendon's refugee appeal of the
same name or do not intend to wear
to the ICWA Formal - remember that
miner's helmets are i n the vogue,
although t h e i r wearers have recently
progessed to be f r i g i d . I f you have,
then I can f i n d , i n private, a one-
feathered friend amongst a flock of
cold plucked-bottom birds whose
'bot' i s oolder than ours. The Norweg-
ians have set a wonderful example i n
their providing of four feathers
per 'bot' of the population. Please
send such help as you can, to( J- The
Base of Moat Ostrichs 'Trouble Headin-
fear-in-sand, South End. Forward soon
and I w i l l backward immediately.
Books i n the OSTRICH series
Include such classics as:-
'Come back to Sorfrontto' l a t e r made
into a song by an IRAte horse slaughterer
' I was a Fellow Yolk of De Yellow
Folk' or 'I was De G i l l ' s Bladder*.
And i t s sequel, 'Or i s he just Green?'
Quoting from a be3t s e l l e r ,
'Back to Back'; "May we be serious,
just f o r one moment please, i f you
don't min?" (This quotation was recor-
ded).
Ah! the background music i s r i g h t
up i n front and down from Birdland - the
ostrich's paradise. What poignacy,
what beauty, what royalty comes from
that a r i a , i n the Fourpenny Opera,
"'My Paper back i s Frozen!" The opera
i s by PUCCINI-BRECHT, otherwise
affectionately known as The PUNCH-BACK
of La Boheme.
Upside-down editorship was not my
only new venture. I am now President
of The Friends and Fellow Sufferers.
'We aim to sneeze and sprad disease;
I f you want a virus wire-us.'
The Union may have i t s ups and
downs but i t has me back to front and
I only mean to be downright upright,
never taking sides l e t alon-; fronts and
backs.

We welcome the return of John Forster

Maintaining the n a i v i t y of a peasant
his philosophy i s s t i l l incoherent
and bubbling. He oontinues h i s cease-

world to express himself and communicate
with his fellow sufferers. Failure
i s lovable.

We .ave the usual problem at I.C.
of the majority of students complaining
about the services that other students
are providing f o r them. Let us not
forget that i t i s easy to c r i t i c i s e .
There i s one form of c r i t i c i s m
which i s welcomed by any body of work-
ers, and t h a t i s . of course.-'construc-
tive c r i t i c i s m . The Editor of F e l i x
and his staff spend the whole of each
second Sunday i n the P e l i x Room typing
and setting out the following Friday's
paper. This i s not small s a c r i f i c e
by such a small body of undergraduates
- l e t us remember that fact. However,
the Editor and members of his s t a f f are
continually being jibed at by the rem-
aining 'unproductive' students. These
people want to know '"When are we going
to get a F e l i x worth reading?"
They are promptly told to write
something which they themselves think
is of l i t e r a r y merit, and i t w i l l be
published. I know from personal ex-
perience that the a r t i c l e s i n P e l i x
are written by a select few, who are
often members of i t s s t a f f , and why?
The answer i s simple; and i t i s t h i s .
Not nearly enough material i s received
each week to ensure a f u l l edition of
eight pages so those people whom I
have mentioned above spend t h e i r
alternate Sundays i n F e l i x room,
have to s i t down and write something
themselves. Of course i t i3 not a
good method of f i l l i n g a newspaper
but what else i s there to do? I
put i t to you a l l - i s i t asking too
muoh that about twenty people on the
average each fortnight out of nearly
three thousand should s i t down and
compose a contribution f o r t h e i r own
peper? By rights the Editor should
have so much material p i l e d up i n
F e l i x room that he can pick and choose
a r t i c l e s from one week to the next,
but i n fact every l i t t l e l e t t e r whioh
happens to be contributed i s snatched
up f o r want of anything better and i n -
serted i n F e l i x . I f e e l (as a non-
member of F e l i x staff) that the dedi-
cated Editor and h i s Staff are h i t t i n g
their heads against a brick w a l l , and
that they should receive every encour-
agement i n their work instead of
unproductive c r i t i c i s m s . Look at
the next issue of F e l i x , and i f you
don't l i k e i t please do not run to
Mike Barron and say so, but do some-
thing about i t . To three thousand
science students I say F e l i x i s
TOUR newspaper, so f o r goodness sake
feed him with succulent a r t i c l e s .

The l a s t C&G Union .,ueting held i n
the IC Concert H a l l was opened by Guilds
president ( now known as Skip). After
the minutes had been read, i t was a.^reed
that the damage done to the chairs- i n 04
during past Union meetings was due to
improper i n i t i a l stressing.
The next item on the agenda was the
motion proposed by John (not to be con-
fused with" Jim-Jam) Garter, "That i n Order
to Relieve Congestion i n the Bar, the
Guilds Library should be open after s i x
p.m." His maiden speech l e f t the-,
impression of s t i l l s and hammocks, swig-
gina and swinging i n the Library.
Then the stage was cleared f o r
action. Jim Carter compered 'Les
G i r l s ' (Les i s not short f o r anything)
in a competition.of-undress suitable for
the Carnival, "Malice i n Undieland", thf
proceeds to be donated t o WRY,
Each contestant brought pennies from
heaven, and o u t f i t s ranged from hockey-
s h i r t s ' to umbrellas. We hope that they
w i l l a l l come along tonight to j o i n i n
the f r o l i c s .
The perfume p r i z e and Ered the b a l -
loonatic went to Miss Ann P o i l l i p s
(believe i t or not of RCS) f o r her
seductive rendering of Love for Sale.
The next Guilds Union meeting i s at
2.30 a.m. on Saturday March 12th, where
