E d i t t m a i Comment
As soon as t h i s issue of F e l i x has
been read, the most obvious comment w i l l
be, "Too much sport, not enough news".
I agree. There _is too much sport - but
remember what sporting a c t i v i t i e s have
taken place over the period of time since
the l a s t F e l i x was issued. We have
completed an a t h l e t i c feat never before
achieved i n the h i s t o r y of the University,
to mention i t i n passing, IC sports teams
have completed the treble, and won the
T r i p l e Crown.
So there wasn't enough news. Well,
to report news, news has to be made.
We can scarcely report that which doesn't
happen.
•This week we've done our best t o
give you a good newspaper, to end the
Spring Term. I f you don't l i k e what
you see (and I expect there w i l l be a few
grousers'.), write to us. I f we haven't
reported something which should have been
reported, write to us. Above a l l , don't
Say, " I t doesn't matter". IT DOES?

I do not know whether or not any
of you have tested your s^rengtn recently
by trying to l i f t that barrel which i s
placed i n the Union Entrance H a l l , but i f
you have you w i l l Know that i t requires
very l i t t l e e f f o r t to l i f t i t . And i t
requires just as l i t t l e deductive a b i l i t y
to r e a l i s e that that means there i s only
a small amount of money i n there, so start
giving your pennies to World Refugee Year.
Next time you t r y to phone her up and you
can not contact her, don't nang on t o
your pennies, put them i n the barrel; or
i f the casaier i n the refectory gives
you a handful of pennies i n your change,
don't r i s k wearing a hole i n your pocket,
put the pennies i n that b a r r e l .
GIVE YOUR PENNIES!!!

read F e l i x and I l i s t e n to Radio Luxem-
bourg" someone w i l l then give you a

Dear S i r ,
May I use your column to ask mem-
bers of the Union who, l i k e myself, are
v i r t u a l l y destitute ana consequently i n -
capable of purchasing their own Sunday
Newspapers, to r e f r a i n from removing
the newspapers, provided ay the Union,
from the lower lounge? A meticulous
search of the Union at 3.30 p.m. on
this ounday afternoon, March 6th, r e -
vealed the grand t o t a l of four ana a
half papers (The News of the ;<orld,
The People, Reynolds News, Sunday
Dispatch and half a copy of the Sunday
Times.)
This state of a f f a i r s has t o t a l l y
ruined my week-end; such a nondescript
array of the f r u i t s of B r i t i s h Journalism
leaves me with but one course of action;
I s h a l l have to go bacK to bed.
lours desponaently,
Alan Logan.
Dear S i r ,
Can the protagonists of the Grammar
School boys a t I.C. prove that more than
two thirds of their number have " l i v e d "
between leaving school and entering. I.C?
If they cannot they have defeated t a e i r
argument put forward by the Harris's i n
a recent issue of F e l i x ,
From 20 i u b l i c School Freshers i n a
c e r t a i n departmenty less than one t h i r d
have come straight from school.
It i s seldom realised that parents
of Public School boys have usually had
to make considerable s a c r i f i c e s i n order
that t h e i r may be sent to the schools of
their choice; so that i t i s the
exception rather than the rule f o r such
a boy to 'retire to his father's country
residence'.
ive have never seen a fancy waistcoat
at I.C. - waistcoats certainly, but
neither fancy nor flamboyant, '
.
'
e would
suggest that luminous socks are much more
obvious at I.C. and are worn f o r the sole
purpose of a t t r a c t i n g attention to t h e i r
otherwise inconspicuous wearers. A
l i t t l e eccentric perhaps?
Andj perhapsj l e t _ts a l l t r y to
speak the QUEEN'S ENGLISH.

Monsieur l e Baron,
"Brown-baggers are Brown-baggers
and ever more shalt be-oh!" No amount
.of cajoling, bribing, o r threatening w i l l
have the slightest effect. Imperial
College, at present, offers the be3t
s o c i a l ana recreational f a c i l i t i e s poss-
i b l e , yet the 3rown-baggers are as numer-
ous as ever.
Personally, I cannot see why the
Brown-bagger i s so sought a f t e r Dy the
Union. Is he a Kind of c o l l e c t o r ' s
r a r i t y ? I f he i s as d u l l as he appears
to be, why t r y to persuade him to take
part i n the Union a c t i v i t i e s , since his
brown-bagginess would surely not be an
asset to any society.
As f o r Sleeping Log threatening to
boycott F e l i x , see F e l i x bankrupt, and
overthrow the 'ruling e l i t e of this
college' he should by now r e a l i s e he i s
incapabae of such an action. A Coup »
d'Etat i s outside the scope of brown-
baggery; a night attack would have to
be made, which f o r him i s impossible,
since by 5.15 p.m. the " l i t t l e brown mug"
i s safely being carried home to suburbia
on the j.13 from Waterloo.
So snore i n your sleep - Sleeping
Dog - by a l l means; f o r my part, I s h a l l
let sleeping dogs l i e , as they d i d i n the

Might I make a special plea f o r more
taste-discrimination i n selecting period-
i c a l s f o r we to read i n the uoper lounge.
Presently there exists a goodly mish-mish
of polico-li,™htsome reading there,
consisting of a majority of l e f t and
right wing propoganda, together v.'ith an
assortment of "popular* oa-asines.
However, where does I look 'for a r t i c l e s

Surelylike the paper-overlordy could
occasionally arovide read-co i e s of "The
Architect", "Design", and/or " A l i c e i n

Dear S i r ,
••hile i n no way supporting 'oleeping
Dog" I f i n d i t hard to agree with the
ravings of (the nearly as anonymous) " J .
C." ".J.C." accuses the former of
w r i t i n g a "sneering l i t t l e l e t t e r " i n a
f i t of unaccustomed intoxication. ^uite
possible; but his own l e t t e r i s hyster-
i c a l l y sarcastic and shows the influence
of at least s i x very accustomed Worthing-
tons.
But, your correspondents apart,
"brown-baggers" miss a j.ot, and are not
a good avertisement f o r I.C. F e l i x
has a duty to remedy this. Much emphas-
i s i s l a i d on beer and student irrespon-
s i b i l i t y , giving the newcomer the' im-_
pression that these are the Union's main
a c t i v i t i e s . When by some chance a sober,
responsible and l i t e r a t e person ( l i k e my-
s e l f ) gets t.ast the interviews they are
n a t u r a l l y repulsed. I f the content of
F e l i x were always as constructive as i n
the l a s t issue i t would help a lot, and
might even wake your somnolent hound
from his manger of self-righteousness to
maKe the e f f o r t neesessary ( I repeat
effort nmmwgary) to enjoy his student
l i f e f u l l y and u s e f u l l y .
If anonymity were not a stigma I
should sign myself "Waking Wolf", but
must admit myself to be
