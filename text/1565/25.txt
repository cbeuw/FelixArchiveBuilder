A very long walk indeed
Mandela: Long Walk
to Freedom
Director: Justin Chadwick
Writers: William Nicholson, Nelson
Mandela (autobiography)
Starring: Idris Elba, Naomie Harris
Runtime: 141 minutes
Certification: 12A
In putting such an iconic, widely be-
loved figure to the screen, the pres-
sure is most definitely on. The film
shouldn’t offend, nor should it be an
unbiasedly kind portrayal, as even the
most celebrated people have flaws to
speak of. And Mandela: Long Walk
to Freedom does get that balance to a
certain extent, putting the long years
of Nelson Mandela’s struggle against
oppression to the screen.
The film benefits enormously from
the presence of Idris Elba who plays
the title role with impressive restraint
and although at appropriate times,
great force. His natural assets, the tall,
towering frame and deep voice work
tremendously to his advantage in set-
ting him up to take the role of a strong
leader. Elba takes his role even further,
putting a very much relatable human
face to the extraordinary man.
It moves at a remarkable pace,

Frozen and Thor: The Dark World
In recent years, many have said
that Disney animation has been on
the down and outs but hopefully
the arrival of Frozen will spell a
comeback! After a falling out with
her sister Anna, Elsa-Princess of
Arendelle runs away, plunging her
kingdom into an eternal winter
because of her ability to create ice
and snow. Anna sets out on a mission
to find her sister to reverse the deep
freeze along with a host of random
m8s she meets along the way.
Frozen marks the long-awaited
return of the classic Disney musical
format but unlike our old childhood
favourites , Frozen uses a mixture of
CGI and hand-drawn animation for a
sleeker, more realistic feel whilst still
retaining the trademark Disney look
that we all know and love.
Thor: The Dark World sees the
return of the eponymous well-
muscled Norse god and his wayward
brother Loki. Thor has to save
dubious astrophysicist Jane (Natalie
Portman) after she is kidnapped so
he enlists the help of imprisoned
murderer brother Loki who is
consequently freed in order to save
damsel in distress Natalie. Thor 2 is
blatantly silly but if you’re looking
for fun escapism, superhero sibling
banter, wonky Hollywood science
and jam-packed special effects, look
no further!

sprinting through the early years of
Mandela as an active revolutionary,
plus the infamous trial where he was
imprisoned for life, then his subse-
quent release after 27 years and his
political actions from then on until
he reaches the Presidency. Just getting
him elected takes 141 minutes.
The idea of a 27-year imprison-
ment is remarkably diminished and
trivialised and its harsh conditions
are barely looked at, during which
time we focus on Winnie Mandela,
Nelson’s second wife, and her more
aggressive, no-nonsense stance to
resist inequality. Winnie Mandela is
played by Naomie Harris, the newest
Miss Moneypenny, who goes through
a startling change from being Nelson’s
female companion, to a fearless leader
who frequently clashes with Nelson’s
more peaceful approach to diplomacy.
And it’s a flawless transition Harris
shows with compelling charisma.
For anyone unfamiliar with any part
of the history it is enormously in-
formative too, highlighting the most
important, intense events surround-
ing the character’s complex life (a lot
of senseless shooting, a lot of riot-
ing, plenty of deaths, cue news chan-
nel clips), but for experts, errors and
missed out details will be glaringly
obvious.
Could this have served better as a
mini-series? Yes. Even at 141 minutes
(an off-putting length for sure) not
everything is squeezed in. With a cast
this good they could have been put to
even more use, and there are of course
such productions planned, although it
will be difficult to find actors as good
as the aforementioned pair.
T
he Secret life of Walter Mitty
is a Ben Stiller film based on
the short of the same name
written by James Thurber
for the New Yorker in 1942.
In the film Stiller plays the titular
character, Walter Mitty, a simple man
in a niche job, born into a grey suit.
The story follows Mitty as he falls
for a new co-worker, Cheryl (played
by Kristen Wiig) and evolves from
a man who daydreams about doing
things to a man who actually steps out
of his shell and taking a grip on the
handlebars of life.
Mitty works as a low-level employee
at a magazine before adapting to
the changes brought in by the new,
modern management team.
As the film progresses, Walter
leaves the comfort of his home to
travel further afield, learning more
about himself while trying to find an
elusive character that he’s never met
in person.
The cinematography in the film
provides a rather stark surreal
experience that adds to the overall
feeling of the film. As the character
develops the scenery reflects changes
the terrain.
The film explores themes of
romance, corporate life and online
dating (via gratuitous mentions of
OK Cupid) over the course of the
film, with Walter becoming more of
an explorer and less of a basement
dweller (something I can sympathise
with - Ed.).
The film also explores the
relationship Walter has with
his mother and his sister; two
characters that provide useful plot
devices in unexpected parts of
the script. The audience also sees
Walter’s inexplicably spry skills on
a skateboard, while showing tricks
to Cheryl’s son in a park (or a stunt
man – if you believe in those kind of
things).
Overall, Stiller has produced a
warm, feel-good, philosophical film
with some amazing cinematography,
a healthy dose of good guys and bad
guys.
However, for people who are
looking for an intellectual, action-
packed movie, it might be time to
look somewhere else...
