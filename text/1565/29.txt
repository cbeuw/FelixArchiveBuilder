1973 - The US Supreme Court legalises
elective abortion in all 50 states which is
probably the last anyone has heard of the
issue.
1957 - A momentous day for the toy
industry and weird niche sports as Walter
Morrison sells the rights to his mysterious

“Strongest” Winter Olympics Team Ready To
Disappoint
F

fter the news this week
that the script of a new
Tarantino film was
leaked to agents, our
sources have confirmed
that Quentin Tarantino suspects
you, yes you, to be perpetrator.
He also wishes you to know that he
will brutally and very, very personally
utilise all the resources at his disposal
to hunt you down and force you to
make amends.
The multi-award wining director
stated that he “always knew you’d do
something like this” and that he was
an “idiot” for even letting you near the
script in the first place.
At press time, Hangman understands
that the violence in Tarantino’s films
will be nothing compared to what
he and his henchmen - Tim Roth,
Christopher Waltz, Uma Thurman
and Samuel L. Jackson - will do once
they find you.
sessions.
“The sessions are a sort of in-depth
analysis of how best to disappoint the
country both in the short and long
term” one squad member stated.
“They vary from how to deliver a one-
off terrible performance all the way
through to how to maintain sustained
under performance over multiple
Olympics”
It has been rumoured that this will
be the most disappointing Winter

n Trouble - Following Lord
Rennard’s refusal to apologise
in the face of sexual harassment
allegations, this editor believes
we should all refuse to atone
for our many misdemeanours.
Instead of admitting to one’s mistakes,
the world would be a better place if we
all just pretended to give less of a shit
about other people’s feelings.
Frankly, if we all went around
apologising for any deed or comment
that has offended, annoyed or
otherwise inconvenienced someone
we’d never get anything done.
Spilt your coffee on someone?
Apologising would be crazy.
Remember, you’re the one who’s
tragically lost their paid-for drink.
Let a friend down recently? So what?
more fool them for trusting you in the
first place.
Hypothetically, it would be acceptable
to apologise if your life depended
upon it. However, given the average
value of the life of a Felix reader, the
reality is that it wouldn’t be worth the
effort.
Rennard should be held aloft as a
paragon of pragmatism and logic
for his refusal to apologise for any
unwittingly inappropriate actions or
vacuous remarks.
So, barge past strangers let down your
friends and write terrible Felix articles
all without guilt as saying “sorry”
would only make you look worse.

Olympics yet. However, this has
been tempered by the fact that many
pundits believe that such low levels
of success in the past has kept the
bar of expectation so low that simply
seeing a British athelete at the Winter
Olympics will exceed most of the
publics expectations.

Erm... sorry kids, Hangman bailed. I’m not sure
what this picture is, but it does remind me of a
facebook profile picture I saw last week, only more
colourful...
