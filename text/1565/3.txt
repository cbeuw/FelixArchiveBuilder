Imperial Debating
comes in top
16 at the World
University Debating
Championships
P
lans have been
announced for a major
refurbishment of
the Imperial College
Union Concert Hall, to
be funded by a grant
from the Harlington Trust. The
space is currently used by a number
of different groups, including the
Drama, Musical Theatre and Cinema
societies. The refurbishment is aimed
at improving the technical capabilities
of the Concert Hall.
The Harlington Trust was created
in 1989 to manage the profit from
the selloff of gravel excavated during
the redevelopment of the College’s
playing fields in Harlington. Each year
the Trust awards up to £50,000 to
Union clubs and societies to improve
their facilities or equipment. The
£220,000 redevelopment grant comes
after the Trust’s Committee decided
on a one off increase to the funding
available, to assist with the ongoing
redevelopment of the Union building.
A number of other improvements,
including a full scale redevelopment
of the Union’s media facilities in the
Beit West Basement, are being funded
directly the College and Union.
Union President David Goldsmith,
praised the awarding of the grant,
adding: “The Union Concert Hall
is a space used by student groups
throughout the year and this
refurbishment is going to make a
real difference to so many students.
The Harlington Grants Fund is an
important source of funding for many
of our student groups and seeing it
being used on a larger project like this
is really exciting.”
The Trust also provided £30,000
to buy new equipment for the gym
at the College’s Silwood Campus
and a number of smaller grants were
made to individual student groups.
Professor Debra Humphris, Vice
Provost (Education) and Chair of
the Harlington Committee, said:
“It’s fantastic to be able to award this
funding to two extremely worthwhile
projects. I’m really proud that all the
money we are able to give through the
Harlington Grants Fund goes straight
to student groups to improve the
student experience here at Imperial.
The Union Concert Hall in particular
is a really important facility on campus
and I can’t wait to visit and see how
students are using the refurbished
space!”
Applications for Harlington Trust
Grants from Union societies continue
to be accepted throughout the year.
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) Yas Edwards, said “The
Harlington Trust agreed the funding
of £215,000 for the project. We are
working with the principle authors of
the original bid to develop the plans
at present. Our intention is that the
space will be improved, allowing more
drama and music groups to make
regular use of the space”

mperial College was visited last
week by US Energy Secretary
Ernest Moniz. In a talk on Friday,
January 17, at the Grantham
Institute for Climate Change Dr
Moniz outlined the US government’s
current energy policy and its plans for
achieving a low carbon future.
He was keen to stress that his
Department understood very well
that we live in a “carbon constrained
world”, and that lowering emissions
was a major priority. His talk focused
on his belief that governments must
use all the tools at their disposal to
help us achieve a low-carbon world,
saying that “we need to prepare the
way for multiple solutions and that
is why we are walking the talk in
making substantial investment across
the spectrum of energy sources”. He
explained the Obama administration’s
new $33 billion loan scheme for new
green technologies and emphasised
the need for a wide range of ideas
in the fight against climate change,
saying that “there is no one low-
carbon solution, but many low-
carbon solutions”. He also spoke of the
problems involved with dealing with
the already existing consequences of
climate change.
Dr Moniz has a highly respected
scientific background – having
attained a PhD in from Stanford
University and held the position of
Head of the Department of Physics
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. While he was only
appointed to his current position
last May he had previously served as
Associate Director of the Office of
Science and Technology Policy and as
President Clinton’s Under Secretary of
Energy.
In a statement given after the
speech the Director of the Gratham
Institute, Professor Brian Hoskins,
said: “We are really pleased that

US Energy Secretary visits
Imperial
Secretary Moritz chose to come to the
Grantham Institute to give a lecture
on US energy policy. His message of
progress on all fronts gives hope that
US technology and enterprise may
give a powerful lead in the effort to
limit global warming.”
The Institute was formed in 2007
as a result of a £12 million donation
from the Grantham Foundation for
the Protection of the Environment.
It brings together scientists from all
over Imperial to carry out research
in the field of climate science. It also
aims to provide policy guidance
to governments and international
organisations, as well as stimulating
general discussion on the topic
through events such as Dr Moritz’s
talk. The Institute has been praised by
Grantham Foundation patrons Jeremy
and Hannelore Grantham, with the
pair saying that it and similar groups
“are vitally important to understand
and respond to the scale, pace and
potential implications of climate
change”.

mperial Debating saw success at
the World University Debating
Championships. Tensions
and temperatures were high
at Rajalakshmi College of
Engineering in Chennai, the host
venue of the competition. During
the second year of attending the
international competition, students
of Imperial College argued their way
through almost 350 teams into the top
sixteen of the tournament.
The team of quarter-finalists
consisted of Ed Middleton, a final
year medic, and former president of
the debating society, James Clough.
Through their smooth speaking skills
and practised persuasive tactics the
pair were respectively ranked 38th
and 41st in the competition which
was comprised of almost 700 speakers
from universities such as Cambridge,
Harvard, Auckland and Sydney.
The competition has nine rounds
of intense mental stimulation. From
the rise of the ‘hook up culture’ to
the private governance of bankrupt
cities, the topics are designed to push
and challenge all those involved.
Clough and Middleton overcame
the competition to fight for a place
in the semi-finals against Victoria
Wellington, Yale and Sydney, who
later went on to compete in the
finals. Despite narrowly missing out
to Sydney, Imperial’s Clough and
Middleton paved the way for the most
impressive result in Imperial College
Debating Society’s history.
With such inspiring results from
their seniors, current members of
the society are fired up to compete
at the World Championships in
Malaysia next year. The tournament,
held from late December into early
January, has a competitive selection
process, with debaters vying to be
selected by an external adjudicator.
The open trials, held internally, are an
excellent training opportunity which
allow people of all standards to try for
success. However, it’s not all about the
World Championships. Opportunities
for international competitions range
from Budapest to Vienna, Slovakia
to Paris, with plenty of tournaments
held at home in the UK. The debating
society urges people to come along
and try it with James Clough, one
of the two successful speakers at
the WUDC this year, never having
debated before beginning university.
However, it’s not all about
developing analytical abilities and
learning to charm crowds into
believing what you are saying. The
social side of debating brings people
together from across the world to
celebrate the New Year in style, with
cultural flair from the host nation. The
links our college makes with schools
from all over the U.K. and farther
afield are ones that will last for a long
time to come. The parties are vibrant,
exciting and filled with students from
a variety of backgrounds, all enjoying
the festivities in the way students do.
Well, with a hint of banter, of course.

debating, e-mail debate@imperial.
