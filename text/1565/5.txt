mperial has opened a new centre
for ICT innovation at Imperial
West.
This new centre is called
London Node and it hopes to
bridge the gap between the research
that is taken and the delivery of the
products commercially.
Paul Jenkins, the director of Node
said: “This new Node will allow us to
establish a focus for ICT innovation
in the UK with a European scope. I
look forward to working alongside
the Node partners, EIT ICT Labs and
our European partners, as well as the
existing innovation ecosystem, as part
of this important project”
London Node will help nurture in
research, innovation and excellence
in education. This will be achieved
through facilitating contact between
businesses and academic research as
well as providing links to funding.
The founding partners of London
Node are Imperial, UCL, University of
Edinburgh, Institute of Sustainability,
Vodafone, BT, IBM and Intel. There
are six other Nodes located within
Europe, these being in Berlin, Paris,
Trento, Eindhoven, Stockholm and
Helsinki; they bring together top
universities within Europe, research
centres and ICT companies.

mperial College and Imperial
College India Foundation
will be increasing the size of
their scholarship programme.
The scholarship is for Indian
postgraduate students who have an
outstanding academic background
and reside in India. The programme
initially begun in September 2013, this
year two full Master’s scholarships
and one full PhD scholarship will be
available. The foundation is supported
by alumni and Imperial College.
Sir Keith O’Nions, President &
Rector of Imperial College said:
“The expansion of these scholarships
builds on the historic and flourishing
relationship between Imperial and its
Indian alumni and supporters. Their
support is central to this scheme and
we’re grateful that their generosity has
enabled it to grow further still.”
The first person to attain the
Imperial College India Foundation
PhD scholarship, Mr Singh,
commented that:
“I am thrilled to have been awarded
this scholarship. Studying in such
an international environment,
alongside world-leaders in their field
is a precious opportunity. I’m very
grateful to everyone whose generosity
made it possible.” Mr Singh wil begin
his PhD in 2014 in the Mechanical
Engineering department at Imperial.
The scholarship launch happened
at the same time as Sir Keith’s visit
to India this January. The visit lasts
11 days and Mumbai, New Delhi,
Chennai and Kolkata will be visited
during his 11 day trip; each city will
have an alumni event where he will
meet with a variety of representatives.

mperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust is currently consulting
on proposals to become a
foundation trust. If successful, a
foundation trust status will allow
Imperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust to become a not for profit entity
that works independently from the
government. The third public meeting
was held on Thursday (Jan 16).
The public meeting discussed the
practicalities on how Imperial College
Healthcare NHS trust can become
a not-for-profit organisation that
provides free NHS care using powers
devolved from government. A new
term – the ‘public interest company’-
has been coined to describe these
bodies. Imperial College Healthcare
NHStrusthopestoachievefoundation
trust status to allow hospitals to be
more democratically controlled.
On their website, they said “We see
achieving foundation trust status as
a means towards bringing our Trust
closer to our patients, the people who
work for us, our local communities
and partner organisations.”
In 2003 the government introduced
legislationtoallowthebestperforming
hospitals to become foundation trusts.
The foundation hospitals will be part
of the NHS but outside the control
of the Department of Health and the
Secretary of State for Health. The
bulk of foundation hospitals funding
will come from the government, and
these hospitals will be legally obliged
to follow the nationally set NHS
standards, regulation and inspection.
However, the Secretary of State will
be losing its power as these hospitals
will run by boards of governors that
are elected and appointed locally.
With these changes, Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust hopes for
greater community involvement on
how local healthcare is ran.
Nick Cheshire, chief executive at
the trust, said: “We see achieving
foundation trust status as a means
towards bringing our Trust closer to
our patients and local communities,
further strengthening engagement
with our people and providing greater
freedom to innovate and develop our
services.”
There are, however, some key vocal
opposition to foundation trusts.
Unison has continued to oppose
foundation trusts stating “NHS
hospitals were already owned by
and run for the benefit of the whole
public. The governance framework
for foundation trusts does not lead to
greater local accountability or social
ownership. For example, foundation
trusts are able to run with only a
very small number of members in
relation to the population that uses
them. UNISON is concerned that
foundation trusts do not represent the
communities they serve.”
Imperial manages Charing Cross,
Hammersmith, St Mary’s, Queen
Charlotte’s and Chelsea and the
Western Eye hospitals, providing
care for around two million people
in north-west London. The public
consultation into the proposals ends
on February 10.

Later this term, Yoyo will also
be available to use at the Union

h-bar as well as all tasteImperial food
outlets around college.
The company are also promising 10%
extra on all top-ups in January and
there are hints of rewards to come.
T
he Victoria line on Thursday
23 January was partly
suspended with severe
delays for several hours due
to fast-setting concrete.
Trains were not running between
Warren Street and Brixton.
Nigel Holness, the director of
London Underground said: "This
afternoon our contractors were
working on the new station in an area
next to the Victoria line signal control
room. These works involved the use
of water and cement which leaked
into the room, damaging equipment.
This has meant there are no signals
working on the southern section of
the line. Our engineers are working
hard to resolve the situation as soon
as possible to get services back up and
running, but the line is expected to be
affected for the remainder of the day
while repairs are carried out."

stage, which will be held on the 3rd-

trip with BP. The Ultimate Field Trip is
now in its fifth year. This year winners
from the UK, US, Canada, Angola,

consumption and be implemented by
2025, with the potential to scale across
the energy industry.”
