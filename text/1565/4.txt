Residential Experience Review
As part of the College’s Education and Student Strategy, a
Residential Experience Review has been commissioned to direct
the future residential experience for students living in Imperial
College accommodation. There is a particular focus on the first
year experience of undergraduates. More information can be found
at http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/education-and-student-strategy/
actionplan/globalcommunity/futureresidentialexperience.
The review panel want to hear about your experiences of living in
Halls so all responses to the survey will be submitted as evidence
to the panel for consideration.

After a successful launch last year, the Student Academic Choice
Awards are back!
the Student Academic Choice Awards – or SACAs – enable
students to celebrate and reward excellence and innovation
amongst Imperial’s academic and professional staff. We believe
teaching and supervision are skills of equal worth and value to
research, and we aim to build a community in which academics,
staff and students all feel empowered to bring forth new ideas.
Nominations are open now until 28 February. For more details visit
imperialcollegeunion.org/sacas.
