Liverpool vs. Everton
(BT Sport 1, Tuesday 8pm)
The Reds suffered an unexpected set-
back against Aston Villa last weekend,
taking until the second half to find
their rhythm, but Brendan Rodgers
will be delighted to have Daniel Stur-
ridge back. Liverpool’s front two are
perhaps the most envied in the Pre-
mier League, and both could easily be
on the scoresheet in this Merseyside
derby. Everton, meanwhile, continue
to look the real deal under Roberto
Martinez. They are making a habit of
holding top teams and their strong
defensive backline means they do
not lose many. Both these sides play
a high-tempo passing game and I’m
expecting them to serve up an enter-
taining draw under the Anfield flood-
lights.
2-2
Tottenham vs. Man City
(Wednesday 7:45pm)
Tim Sherwood has injected some
much-needed attacking energy into
Spurs’ play since taking over at the
end of last year. It is unfortunate for
them that the sides above them keep
winning, as their performances have
unquestionably matched those of the
top 4 contenders again of late. Mean-
while, the Manchester City juggernaut
rolls on and having seemingly re-
solved their away day hoodoo, Manuel
Pellegrini’s side are now hard to back
against. While this will not be any-
thing like the 6-0 rollicking the Citi-
zens dished out in the reverse fixture,
with Sergio Aguero back in conten-
tion, they should have enough to claim
all 3 points.
1-2
Southampton vs. Arsenal
(Tuesday 7:45pm)
Saints could easily have been thrown
into turmoil after the departure of
chairman Nicolas Cortese left Mau-
ricio Pochettino with a decision to
make over his future. But fans will
be relieved to learn it looks like he is
staying put, and the players showed no
signs of being affected by the off-field
uncertainty in their 2-2 draw at Sun-
derland last weekend. They will face
few tougher tests at St Mary’s than
that posed by table-toppers Arsenal
on Tuesday, though. Arsene Wenger’s
men have not thrashed anyone yet this
season, but with a rock-solid defence
they have not needed to. With Aaron
Ramsey potentially back, they ought
to win comfortably enough.
0-2
Man United vs. Cardiff
(Tuesday 7:45pm)
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Bluebirds
showed signs of promise at Man City
and will doubtless go all out for the 3
points again at Old Trafford. But the
Red Devils desperately need to win
and with Wayne Rooney likely to be
back, they should prevail.
2-1
Norwich vs. Newcastle
(Tuesday 7:45pm)
Chris Hughton has a knack of grind-
ing out a result when he needs it, as
the Canaries showed against Hull last
weekend. But Newcastle are a real
handful on their day and are definitely
European contenders. As they showed
at West Ham, they also know how to
win away.
1-2
Swansea vs. Fulham
(Tuesday 7:45pm)
Fulham’s hapless defence should get a
bit of a respite against the underper-
forming Swans. Michael Laudrup’s
side’s home record has been atrocious
of late and there are precious few flair
players capable of lighting up this
game.
0-0
Crystal Palace vs. Hull
(Tuesday 8pm)
Palace finally find themselves out of
the bottom three and Tony Pulis will
be hell-bent on keeping up the win-
ning mentality after they overcame
Stoke last weekend. Hull are no push-
overs but I just think Palace will want
this one more.
1-0
Aston Villa vs. West Brom
(Wednesday 7:45pm)
This Midlands derby is full of intrigue,
as while Villa cannot win for toffee at
home, West Brom are a shadow of the
side that was lighting up the Premier
League last season. Given their recent
woes, both sides would probably take
a point.
1-1
Chelsea vs. West Ham
(Wednesday 7:45pm)
The gulf in class between these sides
is immense, and it is hard to look past
the Blues, who are ruthlessly efficient
under Jose Mourinho. Both these
sides are arguably better defensively
than in attack, however, so don’t ex-
pect a goal fest.
2-0
Sunderland vs. Stoke
(Wednesday 7:45pm)
The Potters have an abysmal away re-
cord and without question the Black
Cats have more to play for. Win here
and they would skyrocket up the table.
With Adam Johnson bang in form,
I expect Mark Hughes’ side to leave
empty-handed.
2-1
