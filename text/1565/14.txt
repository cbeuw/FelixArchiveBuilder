Dear Sir,
Every week I struggle with
the Puzzles page and I feel so
disheartened. Please, please,
please could you make me
somepuzzles that I can
complete?
Kind regards,
E.
Dear E.,
But of course, I don’t always
get every single solution
myself!
I’ll make a few puzzles, just
for you!
Enjoy,
Ed.
Clues:
Down:
1. An animal beginning
with the letter ‘C’ (3)
3. An animal beginning
with the letter ‘D’ (3)
Across:
2. A project shot from a bow
(5).
The sciences move
and Yoyo arrives!
Felix
T
his week has seen the
announcement of the
departurew of the Science
Museum library and the
launch of Yoyo, a new
mobile payments app rolled out at
Imperial over the last week.
There are certainly many sad souls
who will miss the SM library, it’s dusty
old books full of historical facts and
figures, and it’s journals on the history
of sewage (no, not swag), in London.
Fortunately there is still ample
oportunity to loan books form the
British Library, which only a short
no. 10 bus ride away, as well as other
university libraries within London.
What will be exciting is seeing
what will happen to the space the
library vacates, will it be filled with
more books, iPads or a lush cinema
suite for the times when you really
need to compare the contents of your
microfiche to that episode of CSI on
that DVD you bought from Amazon.
On the other hand, as they say, out
with the old and in with the new!
While we see the imminent departure
of the Science Museum library we also
have some fun Yoyo activity to look
forward to.
Well, fine, paying for items is
never fun, but some of our staff have
certainly seen some speedy payments
using the app, despite it’s lovely pink
background. Even the Editor admits
that it’s much faster to use than
fumbling for cash at the checkout,
let alone counting all his pennies and
five pence coins to purchase that sushi
snack from the JCR!
Fear not, this is not recless
promotion, mearly a slighly over-
excitied newspaper that likes having
a cashless lunch. All they have to do
next is amend the app to be compatible
with buying rounds at the Union and
Yoyo and Felix will get on just fine.
Aside form that, and the
embarassing Civil Engineering muck
up that happened on the Victoria line,
we hope you have a nice week!
