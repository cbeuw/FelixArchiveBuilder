FRIDAY 24 JAN
MUSIC
ollowing the release of their
latest effort, Forever
Becoming (the rather
excellent, if a little
mystifying artwork is
shown on the right) , an album that
is instantly distinguishable as
Pelican, while still breaking new
ground, I had the chance to talk to
Pelican’s two guitarists, founder
member Trevor de Brauw and
Dallas Thomas, who joined the
band in 2012 to replace Laurent
Schroeder-Lebec, about the new
album, and a variety of other
Pelican related topics.
Riaz Agahi: Dallas, how did
you end up joining Pelican? Did
you guys know each other well
beforehand?
Dallas Thomas: Well it started
F
The Pelican Brief
with just filling in for a few shows,
then a tour, then another tour...
Two years later it just seemed to
make since Laurent decided he
didnt want to do the band anymore
and focus on family and career.
The Swan King practices next door
to Pelican in Chicago, so we pretty
much met through the walls... Yeah
we all travel in the same social
circles so it all kind of just naturally
clicked.
Has the band’s sound changed
since the change in personnel,
and do you feel that was an
influence on Forever Becoming?
DT- The bulk of the material
was written by Trevor and Bryan
sending files back and forth to Larry
in LA. There was focused attempt
to not be a extreme departure from
what had gone before
and still embrace it a
fresh progression of the
band.
TD- There was
going to be a change in
sound no matter what
since the album lacks
Laurent’s contribution.
Pelican has always
been the sound of
four distinct musical
personalities bringing
their influences and
perspectives to the
table. There was a sense
that removing one of
those voices from the
mix would change
things, but if we kept
our heads and wrote
that the remaining 75%
would come up with
something that was
recognizably Pelican.
I think the new record
bears our stamp, maybe
it’s a bit streamlined in
some regards.
Were you guys on
the same wavelength
or was there a totally new set of
influences?
DT- I felt everything just sort
of clicked right before recording
Forever Becoming. We all have
such vast influences both similar
and different that it wasn’t some
sort conscious effort. We just all
followed what was sounding best.
TD- The writing process in this
band is really intuitive and not
thought out. The influences that are
brought to the table are not overt;
it’s more just a subliminal effect of
all being voracious music listeners.
I think Dallas is right that things
really seemed to click right before
recording - the session was booked
before we finished writing to kind
of give us a deadline, which I think
helped ramp up the momentum last
minute and bring everything into
focus.
How close was the band to
splitting up around the time of
Ataraxia/Taraxis? Certain music
media sources seemed to think
Pelican was nearing an end...
TD- That’s more or less when
we got momentum going again,
although that’s also when Laurent
started distancing himself more.
For me there was never a question
that we’d get back into it post-
hiatus.
How do you feel Pelican’s sound
or way of writing and recording
has evolved since you first started
making music?
Trevor de Brauw: It seems
like we’ve just grown to know
each other better and better as
musicians over time and we have a
clearer sense of how to compliment
each other musically in the space
of a composition. I wouldn’t say
we were necessarily over-thinking
anything in the past, but there was
definitely a sense of laboring over
details in the past that seems to
have been replaced with intuition.
Conversely, in terms of actual song
structure we used to just throw
everything at a wall to see what
would stick, whereas now we’re
ruthless editors. Even though some
of the song lengths tend to be
pretty long, they’re often cut down
or adjusted because we’re very wary
of how the song flows.
I said in my recent review (Issue
1558) that I felt like the rhythm
section was a lot more prominent
and I was wondering if you
thought that was the case?
DT- Yeah I would say that is a
good observation, besides the point
that Larry and Bryan are the bro
rhythm section.
To what extent is there a kind
of context or deeper message that
goes beyond being simply well
arranges music? I read once that
the title city of echoes related to
globalisation...
TD- Our records will always be a
reflection of what’s going on in our
lives between albums, manifested
musically. So context, yes, but I
don’t know that we’d qualify it as
a message. With regards to City
of Echoes- we wrote that record
during a time when our career as
touring musicians was taking off
and we were constantly traveling.
Globalization was definitely on our
minds at that time because we were
witnessing it firsthand on a daily
basis; rolling into towns all over that
bore uncomfortable similarities.
But the album also carried this
sense that music was this unifying
power that had brought us all over
the world and put us in touch with
so many people and cultures that we
did not previously have immediate
contact with.
Forever Becoming was released
October 15th
2013 on Southern Lord
records.
