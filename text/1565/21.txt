Scorsese has created such a variety of
films from religious epics (The Last
Temptation of Christ and Kundun)
to kids’ movies (Hugo) however he is
really known for his depictions gang-
sters and vigilantes on the streets of
New York.
Taxi Driver (1976)
The most iconic film of Scorsese’s fil-
mography tells the story of a vigilante
who decides he wants to clean up the
streets and after deciding he can’t kill a
politician, he goes after a pimp to res-
cue a twelve-year-old girl from a life of
prostitution. The reason this movie is
such a classic is because it masters the
feeling of isolation that Travis Bickle
(Robert De Niro) feels.
The atmospheric music with its jazz
refrains, the slow motion close-ups
of De Niro that let us ponder what
Bickle is feeling and truly appreciate
how brilliant an actor he is. The film
sweeps you along and by the end you
find yourself siding with this sad and
lonely vigilante. The character, Bickle,
is such a wonderful case study I’m sure
it’d be worth doing a psychology de-
gree just to try and figure him out.
The seediness of the whole piece is
really boiled down in the scene where
Scorsese himself plays a near crazy
Goodfellas (1990)
“As far back as I can remember, I al-
ways wanted to be a gangster,” This is
the ultimate gangster movie, and the
first of triptych of films about organ-
ised crime including Casino and The
Departed. The story shows how a kid
becomes a Mafioso, then his treacher-
ous career and in the end how he hates
himself for leaving the life of crime via
a witness protection program. A true
epic.
As with all his previous films we get
fantastic camera moves and probably
an era defining steady-cam shot fol-
lowing Henry Hill through the back
entrance of the Copacobana Club,
through the kitchens meeting and
greeting everyone and into the club
where a table is bought out and put
right at the front for him. It really led
the way for directors like Paul Thomas
Anderson to use such complicated
tracking shots.
The Wolf of Wall Street (2014)
The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese
looking through the eyes of Jason Bel-
fort played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a
corrupt and opulent man travelling
from rags to obscene riches. One of
the first scenes shows Belfort using a
straw to blow cocaine into the ass of a
prostitute and really this sets the tone
for the rest of the movie.
The first thing to say is that DiCap-
rio puts in an absolutely rock solid
performance filled with comedy and
nuance. Alongside him the drug ad-
dled tag along Jonah Hill adds a hi-
larious extra dimension whilst taking
another step away from his teenage
knob-gag-filled past.
However, whether you enjoy this
film will hang on one central tenant: Is
showing a morally neutral take on an
amoral person the same as condoning
what they do?
His life is shown in first person and
style of the film doesn’t stop to let you
reflect on consequences of his actions,
but maybe this IS how Jason Belfort
sees the world. Is this an exploita-
tion film showing egregious sex, drug
taking and violence? Yes. Is that bad
thing? Certainly not.
Most films that have a three-hour
from early career to highlife to decline
movies usually stutter in the decline,
the plot slows down and the character
stops to reflect, the trajectory of this
film is in fact very similar to Good-
Fellas. This character disgusted me
and usually when you don’t like the
main character of a movie you don’t
care what happens at the end. In this,
I was vying for his decline and I was
gripped.
One strange thing to note was in
the screening I saw that the room felt
split between those who were reveling
in his immorality (and laughing in in-
appropriate places) and those who’d
decided he was awful. That being said
lots of the film is played for laughs and
there is one brilliant bit of physical
comedy played by DiCaprio after tak-
ing to many drugs making the 2-meter
walk to his car look like a mile.
Critics of this film will say it is just
exploitation, however the last scene
may give us an insight into what the
director really wants to say, much like
in Taxi Driver.
(Continued after the break with
spoilers)
Belfort, having left prison, is giving
a sales seminar (much like Warren
Buffet does) and the final shot is of an
adoring crowd leaning into listen to a
multiple felon. This is a reflection of
the audience in the cinema peering
into the exciting but depraved world
and makes you stop to think that we
are all happy to forget the people who
Belfort has scammed on the condition
we can get in on the action too.
husband who has followed his wife
to a another mans house where she is
having an affair and then talks about
how he is going to kill her and what
her mutilated corpse will look like.
You follow Bickle in his decision to
become a rouge go on some sort of
spree. The denouement of the film
clashes with the rest of the movie as it
is just SO violent, and this is where we
find catharsis.
BUT…
The final scene shows a selection of
newspaper articles telling the story of
what he has done and a letter from the
parents of the rescued girl. Though he
is praised as a hero we know he was
moments away from killing a senator
before deciding to a kill the pimps. We
are reminded that, although we went
along with him for the ride, now it is
time to reflect on how a racist, fas-
cist who has pretend-arguments with
himself in the mirror accidently be-
came a hero.
