amount of radioactive waste
from the Blackett laboratory
into the atmosphere. The re-
sulting wave of super-intelligent
nuclear pigeons begin a quest
to steal every cherry pie in the
world. As if this wasn’t enough,
they beat you in all your exams
and the marks are scaled so
that you fail everything.
This week, you eat a pie.
Yum. You eat another pie.
Mmm... You eat anoth- whoa!
Slow down, buddy, that’s
enough! No! That’s the criti-
cal mass of pies! You eat so
many pies that your stomach
collapses into ultra-dense
degenerate matter. A bunch
of physicists offer you a PhD
opportunity if you let them
study you. Win!
This week you (incorrectly)
decide it’s not too late for
Movember. You try to grow a
fantastic ‘tache but it comes
to life and begins an evil con-
quest of the universe. You
manage to stop it by eating
an apple pie and getting it
covered in filling, but appley
mostaches aren’t fashionable
right now and so nobody
wants to be seen with you.
You write a lab report on pie-
aerodynamics. Many wonder
why you’re throwing pies off
the roof, but hungry students
below seem to appreciate your
experiment. When you run out
of pies, they start climbing the
walls to eat you unless you
throw them more food. They
eat your toes and you hand in
your lab report late. Zero marks
for you.
This week, fivesixeight adds
vegetarian sausages to their
menu. The fact that the Union
is now kidnapping vegetarians
and turning them into sausag-
es shows just how much busi-
ness they’re losing to the new
h-bar. A rather sadistic looking
sabbatical informs you of the
‘Imperial Pies’ they’ll soon be
selling. You flee for your life.
You buy a pie, only to find that
it’s empty! You decide it would
make a swell hat. Everyone
is amazed at your unique
style and you win a fashion
contract. You become world
famous and spend the next
few months on a global tour.
When it ends you realize that
you forgot to revise for any of
your exams and you fail your
degree. Pint?
This week, you buy a pie only
to find it’s filled with live rats.
You keep them as pets. In a
sudden stroke of genius, you
realize you could get them to sit
all your tests for you! ...But they
are sadly unable to write. Luck-
ily everyone else is too busy
stroking your cute lil’ friends to
do the tests and so you get a
first. Yay!
This week you get a cat for
some reason. No idea why
though, as you discover you’re
allergic to cats. Maybe you’ve
gone insane. Yep, seems legit.
No, wait - what are you doing?
Why are you putting the cat
in a pastry lined tin? Wha- cat
pie!? Are you serious!!? Well,
you’ve definitely gone insane.
Or you’re just a horrible person.
Suddenly, a hole in your wall
starts ejecting pies. Where did
this hole come from? What lies
on the other side? One of your
housemates crawls through to
investigate. They send you a
text informing you they will now
be living in the pie dimension.
You’re annoyed that they’ve
abandoned you just before
your joint lab report is due.
This horoscope is deadly serious.
This week you bring a pie to the
guy in FiveSixEight writing the
horoscopes. Seriously. You’ll buy
him a pint, too. What? You’re go-
ing to h-bar instead!? HOW DARE
YOU DEFY ME! DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM!? THE IMMENSE
POWER THAT HANGMAN
WIELDS!!? You asked for it: This
week, a meteorite falls on you.
This week you must choose be-
tween eating an apple pie and a
cherry pie. What a choice! How
will you ever decide between
the two!!? AAARGH!!! WHY!!!?
The decision drives you into a
catatonic state. You eventually
awaken, only to find the year has
passed and you have missed all
your exams and been kicked out
of Imperial. Pint?

Bustling
Slave Trade
Continues
January Transfer
Window Very Active
DATA IN FOR IT
NOW
“China Corrupt”
F
ollowing the opening of the
first of the biannual transfer
window two weeks ago, the
trading of football-playing
slaves is booming this week.
Whilst it is widely believed the best
slaves are rarely available until the
summer window, many slave owning
clubs decide that investment in
new, fresher slaves is necessary for
increasing crucial points output.
Atpresstime,Hangmancanrevealthat
Manchester-based slave owners were
interested in purchasing a spanish
slave from some west-London based
owners. However the deal is in doubt
due to the well-known disreputable
nature of the west-London owners.
Guardian Revelations Growing Less
Impressive
D
espite recent journalistic
success in playing a
major role in revealing
some of the contents of
the Snowden leaks, the
standardoftheGuardian’s‘revelations’
appears to be dropping. This week
the tired and overworked newspaper
could only muster a “China pretty
corrupt” headline which surprised
basically nobody.
TheexposeofChina’srulingfamilies,
whilst adding a little detail, came with
essentially little, if any, surprise. When
reached for comment, a spokesperson
for the Guardian stated “listen guys,
we can’t always have some dirt on
western governments – I mean,
there’s only so much disgraceful stuff
they can do”
“Ultimately, you’re just going to
have to settle for the old ‘corrupt
government still corrupt’ headline
every now and then” the spokesperson
continued before adding “it’s been a
slow revelations day, OK?”
However,manybelievethistobesign
of a terminal decline in the newspaper.
One respected Felix journalist said
“if they’re not revealing the darkest
secrets of our governments to us, then
what are they doing?”
“Reporting old normal news about
things that weren’t top secret?”
“How’s that interesting?”
The Guardian was quick to move to
reassure readers that more high-level
documents would be on their way in
soon including a hard-hitting piece on
just how much state money Tony Blair
spent on cat food.
This week, you sit on your
friend’s pie. Aw jeez, he’ll be re-
ally mad at you AND it looks like
you missed the toilet. You try to
bake a new pie with your aw-
3sum c00kin 5kil1z, but words
cannot describe the monstrosi-
ty that you create. You run away,
but the union hears of your ef-
forts and gives you a job as
head chef at FiveSixEight.
