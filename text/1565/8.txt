MDMA - a new high in research?
Philippa Skett discusses the benefits of ecstasy, and the laws limiting science
M
DMA seems to be
keeping clubbers and
scientists alike on their
toesatthemoment,with
research into the recreational drug
on the rise. Despite the law heavily
restricting drug experimentation even
within the laboratory, there still seems
to be an unrelenting interest into the
potential medical benefits of many of
the illegal substances out there. With
new research published this week, it
may only be a matter of time before
drugs such as ecstasy are no longer
restricted to the dives and dens of
those partying past dawn.
MDMA, or more widely known
as ecstasy, induces the release
of serotonin, dopamine and
noradrenalineinthebrain,anddelivers
feelings of euphoria, diminishes
anxiety and causes mild psychedelia.
Often the drug will be taken with
other neuroactive substances like LSD
or magic mushrooms, but when taken
alone its effects are usually felt around
an hour after consumption and last
for a further three to six hours.
A recent study carried out here
at Imperial College has revealed
the first images of brain activity
experienced when taking MDMA.
The images, published from a project
led by Professor Nutt, show just how
the drug affects various areas of the
brain and provide a new basis to
support how MDMA could be used
therapeutically.
The images were produced by
functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), and show where
and when blood oxygenation levels
altered throughout the brain under
the influence of MDMA. An increase
in bloody oxygenation is indirectly
indicative of an increase in neural
activity; when an area of the brain
is activated, its metabolic demand
increases, requiring an increase in
oxygenated blood flow to provide
glucose to the neurons that need more
energy.
25 healthy volunteers, all with at
least one experience of MDMA, took
the drug under controlled conditions
and were simply left to enjoy the ride.
Subjects experienced a reduction
in blood flow across the right
hippocampus, thought to be
responsible for navigation, and the
right amygdala that control emotion.
The reduction in blood flow across the
cerebral cortex in general positively
correlated with the intensity of the
drug effects felt by the volunteers.
So what does this mean? A
reduction in neuronal activity by
the amygdala may be related to the
sense of euphoria felt when high on
MDMA; the ability of the amygdala
to harness emotions diminishes and
therefore the feeling of elation occurs.
Not only that, a reduction in activity
of the hippocampus could result in
memory impairment; often removal
of the hippocampus altogether results
in amnesia.
Both the hippocampus and the
amygdala are part of a wider brain
system, the limbic system, which links
emotion and memory together. The
research found that MDMA increases
the functional connections between
the amygdala and the hippocampus,
shown by the results of the volunteers
being asked to recall their least and
most favourite memories while on
MDMA.
Those on the drug recalled their
favourite memories to be more vivid
and emotionally
intense, and
experienced their
worse memories
less negatively.
MDMA may
therefore be
useful in treating
those with Post-
Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD);
if it can make
users’ traumatic
memories less
distressful, it
could be used
as a therapeutic
agent for when
PTSD episodes
occur. It has
been previously
found that the
c o n n e c t i o n s
between the
hippocampus and
the amygdala are
actually weaker in
PTSD sufferers,
so MDMA may
aid to restore
f u n c t i o n a l i t y
between the two
and alleviate
the symptoms
associated with
the disorder,
even if it is just temporarily.
However, in the UK, research
surrounding the drug still remains
constricted, politically motivated
and indeed controversial. Despite the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of
Drugs stating in February 2009 that
it would recommend downgrading
MDMA from a Class A to a Class B
drug, the UK Home Office rejected
the notion. They did this on the basis
that such a reclassification would send
the wrong message to young people,
and so it remained in the highest Class
tier alongside cocaine, heroin, LSD
and magic mushrooms.
Aside from the usual class
classifications in the UK, drugs are
also sorted into ‘Schedules’, numbered
from 1 to 5. These outline the way
drugs can be used as controlled
substances in a pharmaceutical
capacity. MDMA falls into the top
Schedule, Schedule I, meaning it faces
the highest restrictions in scientific
experimentation too. These Schedules
were set by the UK Home Office, again
shoehorning a political framework
into the legislation surrounding
research and making it exceedingly
difficult to access funds and licencing
for projects based on high ranking
substances.
This new research could hardly be
considered as a definitive landmark
in neuroscience in that it does have
several weaknesses; with a sample size
of volunteers that is disappointingly
small alongside a high-level of
variability in the drug backgrounds
of said volunteers, it may raise more
questions than it answers.
However, with previous research
hinting at the possibility of MDMA
being used to treat Parkinson’s disease,
various anxiety disorders and even
possiblypaininotherpartsofthebody,
more research is certainly needed. It
may be that softening the legalisation
surrounding drug experimentation
needs to be done to allow MDMA to
reach its full medicinal potential.
