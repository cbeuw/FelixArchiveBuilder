will probably agree
that the smell of
cigarette smoke is
fairly repulsive -
there’s little worse than being stuck
in a bus shelter with someone who
doesn’t appreciate the finer points of
the smoking ban. But scientists from
the Max Planck Institute for Chemical
Ecology in Germany have found that
the tobacco hornworm (Manduca
sexta) makes use of a similar effect
to defend itself against predators - by
exhaling nicotine at them.
Nicotine is toxic (it blocks the
signalling between nerves and
muscles) and so is used by some plants
as a deterrant against herbivores.
Manduca sexta feeds on wild tobacco
plants which contain nicotine, but can
tolerate the compound at levels lethal
to other insects.
The team identified a gene
responsible for directing a small
amount of nicotine from the
insect’s gut into its hemolymph (the
circulatory fluid - insects don’t have
blood). The scientists found that this
gene allows the hornworm to exhale
some of this nicotine through its
spiracles (tiny holes which allow air in
and out of the respiratory system) and
into its headspace in order to deter
predators.
By gluing tiny sensors over the
spiracles of hornworm larvae, they
were able to measure nicotine
emissions in larvae which had this
gene knocked out. Not only did they
find that that these larvae had lower
nicotine emissions, but also that they
were preyed on more often by the
insects’ natural predator, the wolf
spider.
They say you swallow up to four
spiders in your lifetime while you
sleep. That’s almost certainly a myth,
as it’s not very likely that anyone even
swallows one. But in light of this new
reserarch, perhaps it’s even less likely
if you’re a smoker.

18
years after the
famous Deep
Field image,
a series of
p h o t o g r a p h s
from the Hubble space telescope are
giving us a new insight into extremely
distant galaxies that formed soon after
the big bang.
This new deep image is centred on a
large galaxy cluster, Abell 2744, which
acts as a gravitational lens, focussing

light from extremely distant galaxies
towards the earth. Some of these
galaxies could be up to 12 billion light
years away, making them amongst the
most distant ever seen. An exposure
time of 50 hours was needed to collect
enough light for around 3000 of these
incredibly faint galaxies to become
visible.
A series of images (the Frontier
Fields) are being taken in areas of
the sky known to contain a large
number of gravitational lenses. This
first image will be taken again in May,
using a different set of equipment,
and another five locations will be
investigated over the next three years.
