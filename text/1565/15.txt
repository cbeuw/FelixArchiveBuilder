FRIDAY 24 JAN
ARTS
The Secret Photographers
Fred Fyles gets a glimpse of the works of Warhol, Burroughs and Lynch
T
he Photographer’s Gallery,
nestled in the heart of the
West End, is playing host to
a triumvirate of titans of 20th
century American culture:
Andy Warhol, William Burroughs, and
David Lynch. Or maybe that should
be: Andy Warhol. William Burroughs.
David Lynch. The gallery has decided
to stage this exhibition not as a single
collection, but rather as a trio of
separate exhibitions, each exploring
the seldom seen photographs of these
masters. The result is an experience
that is rich in scope, but perhaps
somewhat underwhelming.
Out of the three, it is Andy
Warhol who has the most obvious
link to photography; the pop-art
polymath’s work was often based
upon photographs, and the idea of
celebrity culture – along with the
media exposure that accompanies it
– is a running theme throughout his
career. Warhol saw the advent of the
‘point and shoot’ camera as a means to
expand his obsessive documentation
of his daily life. The selection of black
and white prints on display act as a
time capsule from 1970s Manhattan,
but the themes that underlie much
of Warhol’s more formal work shines
through: there are shots of the inside
of pantries, documentations of
consumerism, and an obsession with
signage. Celebrity spotting gets an
obligatory mention, best documented
by his candid shot of Jean-Michel
Basquiat looking up mid-bite, a forkful
of pastry on its way to his lips, which
is reproduced and stitched together.
However, since Warhol would often
shoot an entire roll of film a day, it
seems like an arduous task to cut such
an extensive collection down to just 50
shots, and one wonders how much we
are missing out on.
While Burroughs found fame as
an author and essayist, the rarely-
seen photos on display here reveal
his skill as a photographer. Perhaps
appropriate for such a leading light of
the Postmodernists, Burroughs takes
a much more analytical approach
to photography than Warhol, often
cutting and splicing his frames
together into dense and rich collages.
His series What Was, What Isn’t, in
which he photographed his bed before
and after having sex with his lover
John Brady, forms a mediation on the
power of photography to conjure up
ghosts from the past, and places it in a
similar role to the unreliable narrator
in his literary work. He applies his
‘Cut-Up’ technique to portraiture,
creating freakish, unnerving splices
that precede the work of John
Stezaker by 20-odd years. While the
pieces manage to be both candid and
analytical, the lack of context provided
can make them seem – especially
to someone like me, who isn’t overly
familiar with Burroughs’ work –
somewhat heartless.
Any disappointments I may have felt
with the first two sections however
were instantly erased when presented
with the Factory Photographs of
David Lynch. Around 80 shots of
disused factories in Poland, Britain,
and the US line the walls of the gallery,
while an atonal soundtrack, created by
Lynch himself, serves to reinforce the
ominous mood. Given his illustrious
career as an auteur of American
cinema, it is perhaps unsurprising
that his work is the most consistent,
featuring tightly framed shots of
urban decay in shades of black and
white which border on aggressive. The
shots recall Bernd and Hilla Becher’s
exploration of industrialisation, but
while the Bechers’ work is ordered
and playful, Lynch’s is painted in
much darker tones. Grimy close-ups
of pipes and puddles create a setting
that wouldn’t look out of place in his
1977 masterpiece Eraserhead; one
almost expects the shots to feature the
Girl in the Radiator, or any other of his
twisted creations, but instead they are
desolate and barren, and perhaps all
the better for it.
While the exhibition may have
its highs and lows, it is extremely
interesting to see how these three
artists fit photography into their
oeuvres, and explore the themes
that permeate the rest of their work.
The Warhol and Burroughs give us a
candid, and seldom seen, look at their
lives, but it is Lynch who stands out
head and shoulders above the others,
with work that is both eerily beautiful,
and horrifically unsettling.
Corruption of a convent girl

Writer
What: Manon
Where: Royal Opera House, WC1
When: Until 6th February
Price: Various
M
anon premiered in
1884, at the height
of the Belle Époque.
French imperialism
was at its peak,
and a spirit of optimism flowed on
the streets of wealthy Paris. Twenty
years earlier, Richard Wagner had
brought his opera Tannhäuser to
the Opéra de Paris and begun his
cultural revolution. French poets,
musicians and painters had fallen
under his spell, but now was the time
for France to reclaim its place at the
head of the cultural world. Manon was
commissioned from the celebrated
composer Jules Massenet and quickly
conquered the world’s stages.
The protagonist and title character,
Manon Lescaut, is a beautiful young
girl of 16 when she arrives in the city,
destined for the convent. She is quickly
pursued by suitors and decides to run
off with a handsome chevalier – Des
Grieux. Soon, however, she is tempted
by the life of luxury and comfort
offered by her wealthier suitors. The
story explores the struggle between
the passions of love and of greed set
against the backdrop of decadent,
bourgeois Paris.
In this Royal Opera House
production, Laurent Pelly accentuates
this decadence and makes Manon’s
corruption by wealth a symptom of
society as a whole. Rather cynically,
the men, all dressed alike in black
suits, are driven by animalistic sexual
urges and act as a mob, while the
women, by contrast all in white, are
all too happy to oblige in return for
jewels and other goods. The sets
look grey and concrete, but play with
perspective cleverly. As a whole the
affair is rather bleak and Des Grieux’s
piety and good-heartedness stands
out greatly. Manon, although foolish
and naïve for breaking such a man’s
heart, is portrayed as a victim with
whom we feel great sympathy.
The Royal Opera House has touted
Manon as one of opera’s great tragic
heroines, on a par with the likes of
Verdi’s Violetta. Unfortunately, I feel
that despite Pelly’s best efforts, the
work as conceived by Massenet simply
lacks the cohesion, concision and
unity of such dramatic masterpieces.
Manon is evidently a work of its
time; created with one eye on its
audience and one on the competition.
The entire first half of act three, for
example, appears to be an excuse for
Massenet to show off his ballet music
while very little happens to advance
the narrative.
Despitethesehistoricalpeculiarities,
the musical performances were
compelling, and indeed Massenet’s
score has exquisite moments of
sensitivity and beauty. Ermonela
Jaho, in the role of Manon, is a
force of nature whose dynamic
control is absolutely remarkable.
The transformation of Manon from
innocent girl to corrupted socialite
was entirely convincing. On par was
Matthew Polenzani as Des Grieux,
and hearing their duets together was
an absolute thrill. As always with the
Royal Opera the cast and chorus were
uniformly excellent and the orchestra
under Emmanuel Villaume played
passionately, if a little rough around
the edges.
This production is highly
accomplished and the lead
performances phenomenal, but
although Manon is an engaging and
affecting drama, it doesn’t quite
accomplish what it was originally
intended to.
