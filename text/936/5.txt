not consider the production to be a
worthwhile risk. All this for the
lowest subvention per student of
any union at Imperial. Bearing in
mind the facts before you, it is hard
to imagine that so many successful
events could take place in the
shadow of alleged financial
irresponsibility' and recklessness
(Felix 934, 15th May 1992). Indeed
the number and magnitude of the
financial transactions that take place
throughout the year would suggest
that the finances are being dealt with
in an very responsible and diligent
manner.
Yet another area in which CCUs
make a vital contribution is in
student representation, both to ICU
and to College. This is particularly
true in academic affairs. The CCUs
co-ordinate and support a network
of 15 departmental representatives
(Dep Reps) and over 100 academic
representatives (Acc Reps). Here
are some examples of areas in
which the members of this network
have represented students over the
last year: development of staff
student relations, involvement in
student welfare issues, introduction
of the extension to the College day,
student loans and financial
hardship, dealing with problems
arising from lecturers and lecturing,
student union deregulation and
voluntary membership, the lecture
evaluation questionnaire, library
opening hours in the future,
monitoring of teaching standards,
development of study skills,
provision of computing facilities,
design and review of undergraduate
courses, dealing with timetabling
problems, academic staff training
and development, credit transfer
between different U K institutions,
provision of remedial mathematics
courses, discussion of quality issues
within higher education,
representation of women at IC,
provision of humanities and
management courses, discussion of
IC undergraduate admissions
policy, the role of IC in the
European exchange and integration

of students, adherence of IC to
equal opportunities policies, the
viability of running modular
courses at IC, provision of language
courses, and monitoring of student
workloads.
These are just a few examples of
where student representatives have
helped to form ICU and college
policy, by the voicing of 'grass
roots' opinion.
It would be a fair question to ask
how much of the C C U funding goes
into the maintenance of such a large
network of student representatives.
The answer is that it costs
considerably less than a round at
Southside. This is only possible due
to the hard work and commitment
of all those involved. It would be
hard to find such value for money
in any other area of ICU funding -
think about that when you next go
for a pint.
As has been said the CCUs
provide and run a vital academic
affairs network. If the CCUs ceased
to exist, student representation at IC
would be seriously crippled (if it
continued to function at all). No
other system would be able to reach
students and voice their opinions as
effectively. This is because the
CCUs have much closer ties to their
relative departments, all the officers
are current students (unlike
sabbatical officers) and have
relatively small catchment areas.
The importance of academic affairs
alone justifies the existence of
C C U s . However, without the
community spirit that is a direct
result of the close communication
between the union, the students and
the departments that is unique to
C C U s , IC would regrettably
degenerate into the business like
attitude already emanating from
Sherfield.
