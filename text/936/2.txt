Roger Bannister Elected to IC Fellowship
Sir Roger Bannister, C B E , D M ,
FRCP, whose election to the
Fellowship of Imperial College was
announced this week, was at a
dinner in the Sir Leon Bagrit Centre
last night. Sir Roger is one of four
names announced for election to the
Fellowship, along with Sir John
Cadogan, Dr Alexander King, and
John Smith who will be admitted to
the fellowship at the
Commemoration Day ceremony on
22 October 1992. Robert Wilkins
will be admitted to the associateship
on the same day.
Sir Roger Bannister is best
remembered for his world record
for running one mile in 1954. Sir
Roger qualified as a doctor at St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
and was a consultant neurologist at
the Western Ophthalmic Hospital
from 1963-1985. He was chairman
of St. Mary's Hospital Medical
Committee from 1983-5", and has
been vice president of St. Mary's
Hospital Medical School since
1985.
As former chairman of the Sports
Council and former president of the
International Council for Sport and
Physical Recreation, Sir Roger has
been elected to the fellowship as a
'distinguished medic internationally
recognised for his blood pressure
research', and for his 'outstanding
sporting achievements and
provision of sporting facilities for
young people.'
Sir John Cadogan, C B E , PhD,
CChem, FRSE, FRSC, FRS, has
been director of research at BP
since 1981 and is also director of
BP Chemicals Ltd., and BP
Venezuela. Educated at King's
College, he has been a Visiting
Professor of Imperial since 1979.
He was chairman of the Science and
Research Engineering Council
(SERC) from 1981-5, and has been
president of the Royal Society of
Chemistry since 1989.
Sir John was described by
Imperial College Rector, Sir Eric
Ash, as 'a very active member' of
the Chemistry department. Apart
from Sir John's role as visiting
Professor, BP have also paid
£250,000 to sponsor a chair of
inorganic chemistry in the
department. Sir John has been
elected to the fellowship 'in
recognition of his scientific
eminence and ... his extensive
service to the college through his
links with the Chemistry
Department'.
Glasgow born Dr Alexander
King was a demonstrator in
Physical Chemistry at Imperial in
1932, and was later a senior lecturer
until 1941. He led the Imperial
College expedition to Jan Mayen in
1938. A former head of the Cabinet
Scientific Secretariat and Science
Advisor to the Lord President, he
has been a visiting professor at the
University of Montreal and an
Associate Fellow at the Centre for
the Study of Democratic Institutions
in California. Dr King has also been
a director for scientific affairs at the
Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and
Development ( O E C D ) , and
between 1974 and 1984 was
Chairman of International
Federation of Institutes of
Advanced Study in Stockholm.
Dr King was the founder member
of the Club of Rome, and has been
honorary president since 1991. The
Club of Rome is regarded as the
first major environmental pressure
group, and its membership is
currently confined to captains of
industry. Though some of its earlier
research work, such as 'The Limits
of Growth', is reported to have been
discredited academically, it served
to place the issues of environmental
protection on the public agenda. Dr
King was admitted to the fellowship
'in recognition of his remarkable
contribution at an international level
to our understanding of the effects
of science and technology on the
environment'.
The election of John Smith, CBE,
BA, to the fellowship of Imperial
College has reawakened memories
of his departure from the college in
1989. Mr Smith was College
Secretary and Clerk to the
Governors from 1979 to 1989, and
was immortalised by some as 'John
Secretary.' On his retirement, the
post of College Secretary was
abolished and replaced by the title
of Managing Director, currently
Angus Fraser. The current Clerk to
the Governors is Peter Mee.
At the time, M r Smith was
reported to be unhappy about the
appointment of his successor, and
it was suggested that Mr Smith may
have feared the appointment of a
yes man. This has been strongly
rejected by senior management
sources, who insist that the college
and Mr Smith parted 'amicably'.
The appointment of Mr Smith's
successor was handled through an
agency rather than the College
Personnel Department as the
college reportedly felt that the
agency would be better at
'headhunting a suitable candidate'.
At the time, the Rector, Sir Eric
Ash, commented that the title of
College Secretary was 'archaic' and
that the new title of Managing
Director was chosen to reflect the
overall managerial responsibility of
the post. It is understood that the
new title and subsequent job
description were devised only
during and after the interview
process.
Mr Smith, who was fondly
spoken of in IC Union circles, was
Financial Secretary to the British
Solomon Islands in 1970, Governor
of Gilbert and Ellice Islands in
1973-6 and Governor of the Gilbert
Islands in 1976-8. He has been
elected to the fellowship 'in
recognition of his dedication and
tremendous contribution to all
aspects of college life during his
ten-year tenure ... at a time
(1979-89) when Imperial College
was undergoing a period of rapid
and acute change in its fortunes'.
The Associateship of Imperial
College will be awarded to Robert
Wilkins, a technician in the
Department of Physics from
1953-85. His citation 'recommends
the conferment of the Associateship
.. in recognition of his contribution
to the Department of Physics over
a period of 32 years.' The citation
also praises his '(remarkable)
expertise and originality in the
design and construction of
mechanical apparatus.' Mr Wilkins
described the Associateship as 'an
honour which I will be proud to
receive.' This has been a sentiment
echoed by the new Fellows-elect.
