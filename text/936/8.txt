Feature Felix 936 29 May 1992
He was one of those talkative
barbers: I could see it by the size
and shape of his mouth. I felt out
of temper that day, owing to the fact
that, in spite of my morning dose
of Kruschen salts, I had missed my
train to town.
'It's a rotten day today sir!'
'Yes, it is. And it was a lively day
on the 1st, 3rd and 7th of this
month, but the 2nd and 13th were
particularly rotten. And if the
weather doesn't change it will be
rotten....'
He blanched a little, clutched his
scissors more firmly and started
again.
'It's quite unusual weather for...
'Yes, that's so. In 1894, this time
of the year it was positively putrid.
So it was in 1066, 1776 and 1803.
have done for years. So did my
poor father, too!' Clip, clip, clip,
for quite a minute. Then came a
most dramatic discovery.
T say, Sir, I am sorry to see this.
Would you believe it, Sir, you have
quite a bald patch coming; in fact
the hairs are disappearing as the
patch becomes balder.'
'Is that so! I must have caught it
off the cat. They always moult in
the summer. I daresay I shall be
alright in the winter.'
'Perhaps you are right, Sir. But
I have a fine thing here, Sir, Cox's
Concentrated Concoction of Coffee
Grounds, as used by the Chick a
Chuk Indians. Only 10/- for a
bottle, and it makes the follicles
expand and the capsular....'
'What! Do you keep old Cox's

and I beleive, although I'm not
sure, in 1887. I remember reading
what a fine crop of weather they had
in 1733...or was it 1735?'
He said I had little to learn about
the weather, and it must have been
quite a space of time occupied in
removing six hairs before he
commenced again.
'Dear, dear, remarkably dry your
scalp is. Sir.'
'Yes, I always wear a hat when
it's raining. My grandmother used
to say to me: 'A damp scalp leads
to water on the brain...'
'Now, Sir, there's a remarkable
thing here. If you wet the scalp with
it, it gets quite moist and so makes
the follicles to expand and the
capsular glands to contract and
expand with rhythmic pulsations,
and this promotes a luxuriant
growth of hair...'
This was all said in one breath,
but I did him when his wind gave
out.'
'That, good heavens! Why I rub
some in everyday before dinner-
stuff? I thought I was one of the few
old-fashioned people left who used
it. I rub some in every day before
tea, while the kettle's boiling.'
This silenced him for some time,
but I could see his eye roaming over
his bottles, but he remained silent
till the hair arranging stage.
'Now, Sir, how do you like your
hair done? And what do you like on
it? Can I rub some of this cream on
it—it enables the follicular glands
to capsulate and opens the pores...'
'Yes, yes, that bald patch; we
must keep the pores shut or else the
hair will fall out. Can you split that
group of six into, twelve, roll them
out flat and spread them out like a
star? Or is it too late in the season
to transplant a few from the back?
I know it's a bit late for
lettuces...but hairs?'
He looked fierce, and retorted:
'We used to do that, Sir, but the
man who did it was a German, and
now he's gone. But I can paint a few
there if you like.'
This was getting interesting, for
he was entering into the fun of the
thing.
'A little honey and flowers?' And
'hen before I could answer—
'Ah, yes, you of course use that.'
'Yes,' I answered feebly.
'Don't you find it attracts the
bees, Sir? Bay rum?...'
'What nothing, Sir? Let me press
you. Something has just come in
today, Sir, splendid new pomade,
called 'Linolia'. I'm positive you
haven't used it...What, you have?
Impossible, Sir.'
Before I could protest he was
rubbing it in hard with a fierce joy,
and was soon brushing my hair
back. Being in a hurry, I hardly
glanced in the glass, but jammed
my hat on and rushed home. When
I got home everybody stared.
'Well, what's the matter?'
'Been having your hair cut,'
asked the wife.
'No dear,' I answered sweetly,
'I've only had it stretched, marcel
waved and the fringe trimmed.'
'Oh, I see,' she retorted, T
thought perhaps you'd been to the
french polishers, your hair looks so
beautifully shiny and smooth—in
fact we can hardly see the individual
hairs.'
'Is that so?' I quoted. 'New
stuff—barber put it on—just in that
day—splendid, isn't it?—Linolia is
the name.'
'Lin.... what?'
'Linolia, L-I-N-O-L-I-A.'
'Linolia!—that's the stuff we use
to polish the oilcloth.'
'Nonsense, my dear; he couldn't
have used that. Yellow stuff in a
blue tin - pleasant smell of of
turpentine, I think.'
'That's it. Mary, fetch me the
tin.'
The tin was brought, and
everything pointed to that being the
stuff he had rubbed in. At any rate
it took me hours to get it off - nasty
chap that barber - he must have had
one of those nasty, spiteful,
revengeful natures.
