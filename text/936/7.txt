Magritte at the Haywood EuroVision
The celebration of surrealists has
always struck me as being faintly
ridiculous; profound though it may
be, my sensation has tended
towards a gleeful iconoclasm, in the
cartoon colours of Dali, the
eroticism of Bunuel and Man Ray,
and the extremities of Eluard, Satie,
Breton. When I refer to extremities,
I remain in the boundaries of
realism, not surrealism. A 1936
exhibition rejected Francis Bacon's
work as 'not sufficiently surreal'.
I ask you. It's not what you know...
...Am I a hero, for deriding
nepotism? No. Heroes have
character, not trendy God-killing
pretensions that cover up paranoia.
Magritte seems to me to have an
uncomfortable understanding of the
human condition and is able to
depict this with a poignancy and
wryness not befitting his affiliate
cliche. Surrealism isn't big enough
for him. Sorry, I'm a stranger here
myself, and I don't have enough
time; I know hardly any of these,
want to, but would hate them if I
did. It is exquisite, lonely and
romantic. They lack the vague
passions of others, the effete anger
and indulgent smirks. If you believe
this 'less than amazing attempt to
adequately appraise Dear Rene',
don't waste your time going to this
exhibition; you're irredeemable.

A Slip of the Tongue
John Malkovich has returned to the
West End in Dusty Hughes' new
play, A Slip of the Toungue. Set
around the Velvet Revolution
(around 1988) it is an examination
of the mechanism of revolution
through sexual and political power.
Dominic Tantra (J.M.) is a
dissident writer outcast by both the
state and his peers. Through a series
of sexual encounters with informers
sent by the state to trick him into
revealing his anti-state views, we
build up a picture of Tantra, as a
man persecuted and lonely.
The second act is post-revolution:
Tantra has become a folk-hero and
the focus of new-found optimism.
This is where the play stumbles,
after a taut and straightforward first
act, Hughes strives to bring too
many disparate themes together,
creating a contrived framwork on
which to base the play. It works
well on a simple level—the limits
of 'man'—but to read anything
deeper into the play would be giving
Hughes too much credit. Malkovich
is superb, as is Ingeborga
Dapkunaite, but no matter how
good the acting, they fail to rise
above the poor plot. A Slip of the
Pen perhaps?
John.
• A Slip of the Tongue is running
until 8th June at the Shaftesbury
Theatre. Tickets from the Box
Office (071-379 5399) are £13-£20
and £9.50 for student standbys.
Since childhood, Gary has been a
great fan of the Eurovision Song
contest. He is now writing a novel
about the love story between the
Roman Emperor Hadrian and the
Greek youth Antinous. When he
convinces his promiscuous friend
Kevin to accompany him to the
1992 Eurovision Song Contest in
Rome, all the ingredients in his life
are bound to break loose, jumble
up, and lead through the chaos to
a happy ending.
Tim Luscombe's Eurovision, put
on by the London Gay Theatre
Company at the Drill Hall Arts
Centre, just about manages to
contain the resulting mixture by
shifting at breakneck speed through
a good many scene changes. This
is made possible by ingenious use
of props and stage movement. The
parodies of Eurovision songs and
their choreography are hilarious.
Some of the scenes (ghosts who can
only be seen by certain characters,
a possessed woman speaking in two
voices) require serious acting, and
they are well achieved. The play
manages to present homosexual
love as just another instance of
human love, subject to the same
eternal problems. I found it highly
entertaining. Anybody who ever
watched the Eurovision song
context is bound to enjoy it.
