ICSO - Promenade h ^ ^ ^ ^
Friday saw the promenade concert
of the Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra (ICSO). It was good to
see a programme of well known
works interspersed by lesser known
pieces such as Butterworth's 'A
Shropshire L a d ' and
Rachmaninov's second Piano
Concerto.
They opened with the overture to
'The Thieving Magpie' by Rossini.
It was great to see so many
members of the orchestra enjoying
themselves, and Richard Dickins's
conducting showed real Joie de
Vivre. It is a shame that the French
Horns were a little weak in the
solos. I think it was nerves.
Andrew Zolinsky performed on
the piano. Rachmaninov is an
acquired taste, some might say, but
you can't fault Zolinsky's
performance. The Carmen Suite
was made by the beautiful oboe solo
in the Entr'acte which led nicely
into the Toreador Song. The
Butterworth was a competent
example of English orchestral
music and demonstrated the
excellent dynamic control of the
Orchestra. They gave a rousing,
lively performance of Wood's
'Fantasia of British Sea Songs'.
With a little encouragement from
Dickens, the audience joined in with
'the traditional merriment
associated with the last night of the
proms.' Though lack of Union
Jacks and, I imagine, knowledge of
the words, meant that they got
through 'Land of Hope and Glory'
without the audience wailing away.
I'm sure we were all relieved.
Finally, we were treated to
Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture,
complete with simulated cannon
shots (indoor fireworks and loud
bangs) and church bells (tubular
bells).

The Library
/ looked into the library. For my eyes, huge oaks pummelled into
eminent, elegant folds and deep, nutty walls. There sits anger in
these strewn books, mistrust in untidy texts, decay in nonsense notes;
someone's pious, indulgent retreat.
and a meerschaum smouldered thoughtfully, a mind smoking behind
it's unyielding facade and glowing with fresh invention. It's for Me!
to smile at, to guard against, to issue sensibilities, adore and
bastardize as I conceive, unto me, a like mind.
I marvelled at the painstaking chaos and compared it to my own
clutter, three and more year-old thoughts tossed carelessly aside to
warp and age. The leaves brown'd and layered with deadness: It was
too ideal, and in my projection I dismissed it as design
The motive, coy to my mistaking, but silently laughing with all
others, was to share. Still with absent occupant, a prison of wisdom
with none confined! How Hateful! Why be elsewhere? In disgust, I
slammed it shut and tossed it to the floor; the dust rose like the
loathing in my head.
D A Spooner 1992
'So you're back.'
The lepton was inhaling smoke
from a strange contraption strapped
to his side. He looked almost
catatonically laid back. It was
sending Stress in high and higher
levels of frustration and anger.
'Yes, I'm back.'
Stress was gritting his teeth so
hard he thought they would break.
'And you found the information?'
'Yes, the mechanism is set into
the statue in the inner system
stadium.'
'Thought as much."
Y O U KNEW!'
The lepton lifted is lips and shone
his teeth.
'The purpose of the mission
wasn't in the target of your search
but what it would do to you.'
'You've been playing G A M E S
with me??'
'No, I've been giving you the
chance to work things out for
yourself. How do you feel now?'
'I don't care about ridding myself
of the military chemicals.
I just want to activate the
mechanism.'
Another splitting of the mouth.
T thought you wanted clear
perception?'
i know enough.'
'You can never know enough to
make a decision.'
T do, Will you let me activate the
mechanism?'
The Inner System
Chapter 18:
Decision by
Troy Tempest.
'Sure. But to do it you have two
choices. You must either shoot
yourself with the truth gun set to
positive, the setting you've used so
far. It will give you the clear
perception to judge rightly what to
do. Or you can set the gun to
negative and shoot yourself, giving
yurself the anger drive to force
yourself to carry it out.'
Stress hesitated before his
reflection in the mirror lenses.
T can't have both?'
. '.Not possible. Well, which one?'
Stress looked at the weapon in his
hand and thought of the effects. He
paused, clenched his teeth and
turned the switch to negative. He
put it to his head and pulled the
trigger.
'The only way to get at the
pedestal is by playing in the
thunderball game taking place in an
hour. We're disguising you as a
player in one of the teams.'
The rebel assistant fed him the
information as he covered Stress in
a wolf suit. Stress took the data in
without comment, he was beyond
thought, his mind swelled only for
action.
'The thurnderball players have all
taken chemicals to regress their
gene structure back to primitive
animals, your team is the sector one
werewolves. We'll plant you in the
team on the way to the stadium.
Good luck!'
The animal mask went over
Stress's head.
