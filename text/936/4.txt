Opinion Felix 936 29 May 1992
By college rules, the Constituent
College Unions (CCUs) are
financially autonomous, ie we can
go bankrupt, be sued, and held
liable for ultra vires (illegal)
payments, just as any other student
union or small company. This
means that we could, if we desired,
get our subvention direct from
college (as St Mary's do) and also
have complete budgetary freedom
(we can spend our subvention as we
see fit, with no reference to
Imperial College Union, unlike
Major Sub Committees). The result
of this is that, in the case of financial
discrepancies, the C C U President
and Honorary Junior Treasurer
(HJT) would be held responsible.
subsidies. In our end of year
accounts it is not specified what ball
subsidies are allocated to, so they
could be considered to be a subsidy
for the band and ticket excesses
paying for the complementary
tickets issued. In any case a £660
subsidy for our events which have
a turnover approaching £20,000
(less than 5% subsidy) making it
incredibly good value for ICU and
the student's money which they
handle. The main thrust of the
Attorney General's ruling in 1983
was to prevent the payment of
monies to political funds. On no
occasion has City and Guilds made
any payments to any political
organisation.
The City and Guilds Union
What does the
C&G Union do?
Is it redundant
or is it an
indispensable
part of IC
life? The C&G
Executive
Committee
propound their
views
Because of the level of importance
attached to the job of running a
CCU's finances we are overseen by
our own Honorary Senior Treasurer
(HST) who is a senior member of
staff.
Ultra Vires Payments
The payments for free ball tickets
had been a long standing tradition
with the unions of Imperial College,
and at no point since 1983 when the
Attorney General made the ruling
was the legality of these questioned.
The question of the legality of such
payments has now come to light
and, as a responsible union, we
have not claimed any more of these
Financial Responsibility
As many people may be aware,
ICU has attempted this year to
introduce credit control for all union
activities, which is undoubtedly a
good idea bearing in mind previous
bitter experiences. As part of the
credit control system, ICU have
introduced forms attributing
financial responsibility to the
chairman and treasurer of each of
the clubs and societies. This means
that all payments above a certain
limit must be authorised by ICU.
However, the CCUs have not
reached an agreement with ICU
regarding their forms for financial
responsibility although there is a
discussion document in circulation.
It is then clear that ICU currently
has no control over the CCUs'
expenditure. It is also unlikely that
any such agreement, even between
ICU and the clubs, would hold any
water in a court of law. In industry,
the perpetrators of a substantial
financial 'cock-up' cannot be held
personally liable for any of the
money. The only retribution
available to the company is to
dismiss the person in question.
Within a union, unfortunately, in
order to dismiss the Chairman or
Treasurer, its is necessary to pass
a motion of 'no confidence' at a
union meeting.
Value for Money
CCUs offer excellent value for
money, in the case of City and
Guilds for this year's subvention of
£15,707 we offered Guildsheet and
a full colour Fresher's Handbook,
6 departmental societies, a 1902
veteran car and a 1926 Neracar
motorbike (used for charity
collections), 2 hovercrafts, 2 active
Rugby teams (who go on
international tour each year), the
best student Motor Club in the
country (with over 200 active
members, holding over 50 events so
far this year), motor-karting (more
than 80 people have been on visits
this year), 6 freshers' buffets
attended by over 700 students,
dinner for the Heads of Department
(where student views are discussed
on an informal basis), the Great Egg
ICU currently
has no control
over the CCUs'
expenditure
race (where students from 5
departments competed in heats to
get to the final, judged by Bob
Symes), A dinner and dance at a top
London Hotel attended by over 400
students, a May Ball attended by
over 80 students, a Cocktail party
attended by captains of industry
promoting the college, a Float at the
Lord Mayor of London's show (the
only college to do so), bar nights
with live entertainment, a Ladies'
lunch, a Hallowe'en Boat party,
Carnival (for rag), Casinos
(throughout the year), and a 'Funky
Chicken' party.
On top of all this, there are
activities such as the backing of
Grease, which would not have been
possible without the financial
autonomy of the CCUs as ICU did
