Pub Board Chair Resigns Biology Restructured
David Henderson-Begg resigned as
ICU Publications Board Chairman
on Wednesday saying that 'recent
events make it impossible to
continue in my capacity as
chairman.' Imperial College Union
President, Zoe Hellinger, reacted
with regret to the letter, saying that
it was a 'shame' that the resignation
had occurred.
Mr Henderson-Begg cited
'immature behaviour' on the part of
'union officers' as a reason for the
resignation. He later named
Jonathan Griffiths, ICU Deputy
Prsident. and Steve Farrant, ICU
Honorary Secretary, as these union
officers. He also accused union staff
of being 'unprofessional.' Union-
president Hellinger said that she did
not think that 'these are the real
reasons' for the resignation. She
also added, 'I'd like to talk to him
about it.'
Ms Hellinger also pointed out that
there is a procedure for dealing with
staff complaints. 'If anyone has
problems with staff, they should
come and talk to me or Mandy
(Mandy Hurford, Union Manager).
If a student afterwards thinks that
the procedures are unsatisfactory,
then action can be taken against the
relevant sabbatical.' Jonathan
driffitljs, (31), recently returned
from study leave, was shocked by
the resignation. 'We all stood by
him.' he said.
In the event of the resignation of
the Publications Board chairman,
the secretary becomes acting chair.
This year's secretary, Philippa
Love, has already been acting chair
this year. The previous Pub Board
chair, Richard Eyers, resigned in
February, following the 'Felix
theft' scandal. Ms Love is reported
to be upset at this current
resignation and Felix has learned
that she may resign as Pub Board
secretary.
Speaking to (CNN in the Felix
office, M r Henderson-Begg was
adamant that 'the real reasons for
the resignation were contained in
the letter.'
The concerns over recent changes
in Biology course structure have
prompted Dr John Brady, of the
Biology Department, to explain that
the removal of courses from next
year's second year is because much
of the material has been covered in
this year's first year. Dr Brady told
first year biologists that they would
now have a choice from three
fields, Microbiology, Plant Science
and Animal Science. He added that
some courses will be common to all
fields because 'regardless of their
final degree, everybody coming out
of the Biology course must have a
proper background in molecular
biology and population biology.'
Commenting on the lack of
consultation with students, Dr
St Mary's Election Results
St Mary's Hospital Medical School
Students' Union (SMHMSSU)

an electorate of about 590. Mark
Swan was elected president, Michel
Erlewyn-Lajeunesse was elected
vice president with responsibility
for external affairs, Chris Sweeting
was elected treasurer and Catherine
Ashworth was elected as secretary
unopposed. The new executive
takes office on 1 July.
Those St Mary's election results in
full: President: Farhad Islam, 98;
Mark Swan, 193. Vice President:
David Caldicott, 111; Michel
Erlewyn-Lajeunesse, 169.
Treasurer: Chris Carey, 75; Maria
Robson, 80; Chris Sweeting, 130.
Secretary: Catherine Ashworth,

Squatting Criminalised
The Home Office has announced
that it has received over 200 replies
to its consultation paper on
unauthorised occupation, or
squatting. The paper was published
in November 1991 and invited
views on whether squatting should
be criminalised.
The current legal position is that
squatting is a civil offence, as it is
regarded as a dispute between
individuals. In England and Wales,
squatters can be prosecuted with
trespassing. Owners can reclaim
their property by obtaining a
possession order from the courts, a
process which can take several
months.
The consultation period ended
during the General Election
campaign, on 31 March. The
Conservative Party manifesto
pledged to criminalise squatting -
'we will create a new criminal
offence of squatting, to give greater
protection to the owners and
occupants of shops, commercial
premises, houses and flats.' The
manifesto read 'squatting is nothing
less than the seizure of another's
property without consent. Having
consulted widely on the subject, we
have decided to extend the criminal
law dealing with squatting.'
This suggests that the
government, or at the very least the
Conservative Party, had already
come to a decision before the end
of consultation. Julian Woolfson, a
spokesman for Conservative
Central Office said yesterday that
there was a difference between the
view of the Government and the
view of the Party. 'Now that the
election is over, the Government
will consider the consultations.'
The National Union of Students
has condemned the consultation
document as 'staggeringly
inaccurate' and 'insulting'. Imperial
College Union President, Zoe
Hellinger, said that squatting was
not a problem at Imperial, but could
become one. The University of
London Union (ULU) recently held
a workshop on squatting.
Brady told Felix that 'unfortunately
this is inevitable. Do we ask A-level
students to design their
curriculum?' but added that there
would be 'choices at every level.'
Questioned on the new course
structure, Georgina Mennim, the
Biology Departmental
Representative said 'in a way
having less apparent choices is bad.
However, there will be more
resources available, for example, in
practicals.' She also said that
although the changes might seem
unfair 'compare this with the
current second year and you shall
see the course has been changed but
the content hasn't.' Student reaction
has been reported as 'varied.'
'Gardens' to close?
The College Catering Manager,
Simon Westerman, was last night
unable to comment on rumours that
the Gardens restaurant in Southside
is to close. M r Westerman is
reported to have proposed the idea
in a discussion document submitted
to Imperial College Bar and
Catering Committee. M r
Westerman is also reported to have
proposed the moving of Belushis
Pizza Bar and Southside Bar to the
Money-go-round
Imperial College Union Finance
Committee (UFC) last night
approved the funding of three
computers for the Union Office of
the contingency fund. This is the
first phase of a plan to completely
computerise the finance office and
provide a computing facility for
societies. This would allow
Imperial College Union to offer the
same facilities as the Constituent
College Unions who provide
computer facilities for their union
officers and societies.
One Union computer will be
dedicated to the use of societies,
with the second being used to run
an accounts package for the Major
Sub-Committees (MSCs), thus
allowing the computerisation of
their accounts. The final computer
will be used by Stefano Ruis, ICU
Welfare Advisor, to aid him in the
preparation of welfare advice and
the creation of a welfare database.
Steven Newhouse, S C C (Social
Clubs Committee) Chair, said 'it is
about time that Imperial College
Union (ICU) offered these facilities
for their societies'. He further
added, 'it will make the job of the
MSC Treasurer much easier as less
time will be spent on niff-naff
paperwork.'
Sherfield Building.
Plans for the reform of Linstead
catering are also reported to be in
existence. It has been suggested that
these involve moving Gardens to
Linstead, or moving Linstead
Catering into Gardens. Dr Jan
Bradley, speaking to / C N N last
night, said that she had read
documents and that she had made
it clear that Linstead residents
would be opposed to such a move.
In other business, the Film
Society presented a claim for a pair
of 35mm Projectors. The claim had
been on last year's Social Cultural
and Amusements Board (SCAB) 5
year plan, but had been delayed by
last year's Deputy President,
Benjamin Turner. Half of the
money for the original claim of
£6013 was provided earlier this
year by the Imperial College Trust.
At the time U F C was unsure if it
could fund the other half of the
claim and postponed the decision
until later in the year. In the interim
it had increased to £6750. All
money to fund the claim is now
available.
Controversy still surrounds the
eventual location of the projectors.
/ C N N understands that FilmSoc is
planning to put the projectors in
MechEng 220 where they show
films at present. They are under
considerable pressure to move to
the Union Building if raked seating
is to be placed in the Concert Hall
over the summer. This would give
the Union its own stereo cinema
complex. The decision on the
summer refurbishment: will take
place at the next House Committee
meeting on June 8th.
