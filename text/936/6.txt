The Mambo Kings
1952, the Mambo craze sweeps
America. The Castillo, Brothers,
Cesar and Nestor, come fresh from
Havana with their dreams of fame
and love and their exciting, vibrant
music.
The Castillo brothers struggle
with America, attempting to make
it whilst struggling also with the
deep passions inside them. Cesar,
(Armand Assante), has a lust for life
and dreams of bigtime and this is
surpassed only by the deep fraternal
love for Nestor (Antonio Banderas).
Nestor is sensitive and introverted.
He is consumed and tortured by his
unrequited love for a woman in
Cuba. This comes to symbolise all
he has left behind and is the basis
for for 'Beautiful Mario of my
soul', the song which brings them
to the fame that Nestor does not
really desire. He would prefer a
little club where he could play his
music as he meets his wife
(Maruschka Detmers) for the first
time.
The images of the film are
colourfully intense, from the
splendour of the clubs to the harsh
reality of the brothers's daytime
work. It portrays the passion of the
brothers really well.
In the end, the film is an
alternative version of 'The
American Dream': To start from
nothing, to get there, and then to see
it all go up in flames. Then to start
again, having to bear the pain. It is
a tragic, love story.

Daughters of
England
Ruby
The plot of Daughters of England
is based on the short story A Society
written by Virginia Woolf. Four
young women start questioning the
value of books and their enquiries
soon expand to question the entire
body of knowledge and human
achievements. This leads them to
ask themselves 'Have men
produced anything that is
worthwhile?. 'Is it worth giving
birth to men?'. The women vow not
to have any relationship with men
until their questions are answered.
They begin a voyage of discovery
visiting art galleries and theatres,
questioning sailors, noblemen and
scholars, until one of them meets a
fascinating handsome Oxford
fellow and breaks the promise. The
break out of a war puts a sudden end
to their search.
Although the idea is interesting,
most of the dialogues sound slightly
artificial and the play does not
succeed in involving the audience.
The acting was generally good and
a few scenes stand out due to the
very good performance of the only
male actor David Schonman.

Ruby is about Jack Ruby. Jack
Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. Lee
Harvey Oswald shot John F.
Kennedy, in November 1963.1 was
under the impression that almost
everyone knew that. I was wrong.
This film is based on his story.
Jack Ruby (Danny Aiello) is a
small-time club owner in Dallas.
Fact. He has mafia connections.
Possible. Sheryl Ann Dujean, stage
name Candy Cane, (Sherilyn Fenn,
Twin Peaks) is a waif, a stray, and
a stripper. Fiction. Candy Cane
never existed. Therefore all of her
actions never existed. And none of
the consequences of those actions
ever happened. Candy Cane never
met the mafia, never went to Las
Vegas, which meant that Ruby also
never went to Vegas, never found
out about the plot to kill Castro,
which led to him killing Lee Harvey
Oswald. So the entire structure of
the film falls apart.
Why take a fictional story, base
it on a real life character, who
played a vital part in 20th century
history, but still include fictional
characters to link the story together,
in a way that the past never did?
The film is also not very
compelling. The first 75 minutes of
the film drag. I thought six years
had passed only 30 minutes into the
film. The last twenty minutes pass
in a rush, with the shooting of JFK,
and the last four years of Ruby's
life, which he spent in a Texas jail,
were covered in two minutes. This
is where the film should have
started. Not where it should have
ended.
