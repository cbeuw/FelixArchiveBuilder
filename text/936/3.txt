29 May 1992 Felix 936 Letters
Presidents Hockey
'It was that time of year again when
the challenge went out from the old
boys and girls of IC Hockey Club.
For the first time in as long as
anyone can remember the College
men's teams had a successful day.
Unfortunately the College ladies
only managed a good tan. With the
old girls in full charge of the pitch.
The hockey was fast and furious
with the teams taking advantage of
rolling substitutions. Fortunately for
College they managed to stop the
old boys settling down and from
controlling the game with their
short corner routine. College played
impressively as a team, something
&e old boys possibly lacked. Yet
with a little more prior organising
the old boys (Windy Millers) will
be back in full strength for next
year's game.
Thanks go tc the present club
executive and all the members, we
wish them all the luck in the coming
season. Special thanks go to Dr
Hardwick and his wife for battling
through the traffic, to umpire the
games and provide a wonderful
meal.
Any queries about the Windy
Millers touring sides should be
directed to Duncan Fitter on
081-692 5423.
Chemical Jubilee
Dear Adam,
Re: Chemical Engineering
Jubilee Appeal.
I was pleased to see the note
about the success of our Jubilee
Appeal in last week's edition of
Felix. Unfortunately, the jubilation
expressed is still a bit premature!
We have, indeed raised some
£100,000 from alumni and close to
£200,000 from industry. However,
we are still in the midst of
negotiating with other
representatives from industry with
a view to raising the balance and
reaching our ultimate goal of half-
a-million pounds. We hope to reach
this goal by the end of 1992.
As you stated in the article, all the
funds raised will be used to improve
teaching facilities in the Department
and to provide scholarships to a
large fraction of our
undergraduates.
Yours sincerely,
Lester Kershenbaum,
Professor of
Chemical Engineering.
Accounting Exam
Dear Adam.
In your 8 May edition (Felix 933)
you published a letter about the
conduct of the Accounting and
Finance examinations sat on
Tuesday 28 April 1992.
The examination comprised two
elements: coursework and an 'open
book' written paper taken on 28
April. Regrettably there have been
serious shortcomings in the setting
of the question paper and in the
requirements for course work. The
examiners are fully aware of these.
No student has committed any
examination offence, but
understandably students who have
been candiates for the examination
will be concerned to know what
action is being taken and how it
affects them individually.
Although there was an
irregularity in setting the question
paper for 28 April, students will nor
be required to resit a revised paper.
Only a small number of students,
and most certainly from only one
department, were likely to have
been advantaged by the irregularity,
so it would put unnecessary
pressure on students to require them
all to sit a revised paper.
Furthermore any students
advantaged by the irregularity have
done nothing wrong, so again it
would not be equitable to require
them to resit on their own.
The Board of Examiners will take
fully into account the extent and
nature of the irregularities in the
conduct of both elements of this
examination. To ensure that no
individual student or departmental
group of students is disadvantaged,
the Board of Examiners will
carefully assess the examination
scripts and coursework in separate
departmental cohorts. Students will
be assessed against absolute
standards and not in comparison
with other examination candidates,
and especial attention will be paid
to those candidates whose
performance is at or near the
pass/fail borderline.
Steps are being taken to prevent
any recurrence.
Yours sincerely.
F V McClure. Academic
Registrar.
It is well known that heat and
humidity adversely affect the
hypothalamus - this being a
contributory factor to the occurence
of so many riots and revolutions
occur during hot summery days.
Add to this that everybody in
College is either suffering or knows
somebody who is suffering exams
at the moment the atmosphere
in this office has been very stressful
this week. Hence the lack of pages
and bittiness of the entries. Many
apologies.
I visited the Q T snackbar recently.
In my defence, I have to say that I
was very hungry and I happened to
be on the Sherfield walkway. I'm
sure you understand - these things
happen to the best of us. They have
a good selection of sandwiches
there, at a reasonable price (95
pence -reasonable in London). Yet
you would not know that they were
95 pence unless you asked. In fact,
after a brief scurry around, a
number of items were observed to
be unpriced. I asked a shop assistant
what prices the sandwiches were -
which she told me - and then I asked
why they weren't visibly priced.
'Students keep stealing the prices,'
she said. Well, that's convinced me.
'Have you been here before?' she
asked. I nodded. 'Well then, you
should know what the prices are.
Sandwiches are always 95 pence.'
Yup. Until such time as the price
goes up and nobody is notified of
it until they reach the cash register.
Hence it being illegal not to display
prices. A letter was written to Felix
earlier this year on this very subject
and nothing has been done about it.
The behaviour of the till staff at Q T
is not illegal, but very rude. The
only communication made is an
outstretched palm accompanying
editorial
the beep-beep-beepity-beep of the
cash till. You have to study the till's
readout whilst fumbling for change,
only to receive a 'tut' when the
exercise takes longer than five
seconds. I would like to point out
to the staff of QT that the clientele
of that establishment are responsible
for the continuance of their jobs,
and to the managers that customers
deserve a certain respect. My
money is not the QT's by right and
if it is an unpleasant place to go to
then I won't bother.
The Last Issue.
The last issue of the year will come
out on the 24th June. If you want
anything in that issue, please submit
it to the Felix Office by Friday June
I2th. It would be a great idea if
clubs and societies could get a short
(200-500) word report of their year
in by that time. It would be
appreciated if these were in English,
but this is not mandatory. Any
features (with photographs, if
possible) would be gratefully
received. I hope that it will be a
BIG one. There is the possibility
that some Felix staff will be
approaching individuals around
college to put together a 'study of
the human form' feature. They
should ask permission to
photograph, they should be able to
prove that they are working for
Felix, and they are not involved in
a spoof.

The Beit Memorial, which is to be
placed in the new archway leading
into the Union Quadrangle, is, I
understand, very near completion.
It is fitting that such a memorial
should be erected as soon as
possible after the death of such a
great man in order that the memory
of the College's greatest friend and
benefactor may be preserved. For
the benefit of those who are not
acquainted with the facts. Sir Otto
Beit assisted substantially in the
building of the Royal School of
Mines building and built the Old
Hostel entirely, besides founding
the Beit fellowship and assisting in
many other scholarships. His last
gift to the college was announced
when his will was proved just over
a year ago, it was a gift of £25,000.
Phoenix. June 1932.
