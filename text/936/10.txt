Felix Felix 936 29 May 1992
So what's been happening this week
then? Tuesday afternoon saw
another fine example of Zoe
Hellinger being under the beck and
call of DramSoc. Moose (Ms for
short) Hellinger clearly
demonstrated that she really is their
very own 'puppet on a string' by
abseiling down the side of the
Marge's Column
Union building. It's a shame that the
regular type students do not have
such control over our illustrious
presidential type person. Her other
comrades seem rather thin on the
ground though. On the same
afternoon she was seen sitting'
basking, most un-shark like, in the
last of the evening haze. This act of
lethargic horizontal exercise was
singularly occupying her precious
time on the otherwise empty plains
of Beit Quad. Is this her severe lack
of character or the bad choice of
underarm deodorant in these days
of sweltering heat? Our readers
must be told.
The summer orgy of '92 seems
to have been done and over, or leg
over which is far more appropriate.
Coming in as the clear winner by
all accounts was your very own
Marge. A result to fill you with
confidence, knowing now that your
columnist is fully qualified. Yes, I
am completely and utterly depraved
rather than deprived. The
participants of this particular
'session' have gone back to their
regular lives as boring first year
Physicists and such like. But, while
we rest, others have taken up on the
idea of a total week of deprivation
and debauchery, not to mention the
whipped cream and cornflakes!
Perhaps, for those of you requiring
inspiration and a push start, you
would like to pick up a copy of your
very own purity test. Four hundred
questions to tickle your taste buds
which you can pick up by popping
into the Felix office at anytime and
pay for a photocopy themselves -
it's the safest bit.
Rachel 'I'm Rag Chair Soon'
Mountford seems to have been a
very naughty young girlie recently,
and the betting stakes have changed
drastically:
Alex Taverner, who requested to
be removed from this list for the
sake of his beloved wife to be (and
his beloved genitals) - 2:1 (fav);
Vinay Rai, obnoxious RCS/Guilds/
person/thing - depending on who
wants him - 100:1 (I have just been
informed that he 'has absolutely
nothing to do with us, we're trying
to get rid of him' by a spokesperson
for the RCS. We are awaiting a
comment from Guilds); Daniel 'my
name is not Polish it's German'
Katzenellenbogen, non horizontal
jogger - 4:1; Marge T don't do it
lying down I only do it on my head'
- 3:1; Stuart 'Oh my God I don't
believe she's doing this' Rison -
5:1.
I think that's about it for this
week as Declan 'reporting live from
outside Westminter' Curry has
informed me that the rest of this
page is needed for an advert, so
now...
