ABORTION-the issues
involved
The abortion issue has been much debated in and around IC
recently with the Life lecture, the N A C conference and the
ICWA debate. These debates whilst serving to clarify the views
and aims of each of the camps involved has not involved a wide
audience. Thus, F E L I X presents on these pages the various
aspects of the abortion debate.
The passing of the 1967
Act helped to focus attention
on the need for better con-
traception, for more and
improved sex education, and
for safer abortion techniques.
The A c t also exposed many of
the problems faced by con-
temporary women, and the
services provided under the
A c t helped to alleviate these
problems. B y legal Using
abortion, much jndi vidua I
suffering w a s relieved.
Unfortunately, sufficient
provision was not allowed for
the A c t — with the result that
considerable strain was imposed
on the N H S . T h i s has lead to
marked inequalities over the
country in the provision of
services for legal abortion a s
illustrated by our own Health
Centre.
Due to the fact that the services
provided by the N H S have been
inadequate, profit-making
practices have flourished,
w h i c h for sufficient money w i l l
provide abortion on demand.
However, the report from
the committee on the Abortion
A c t shows that abuse of the
act h a s been limited.
The James White (Amend-
ment) B i l l (which lapses at the
end of this parliamentary
session) i s an attempt to limit
abuse of the 1967 A c t , but it
seems to have failed to do s o .
The present law allows a
woman an abortion if two
doctors agree that
(a) continuing the pregnancy
involves greater risk to her
life; or
(b) continuing the pregancy
involves greater risk to injury
to her physical or mental health
of than an abortion; or
(c) continuing the pregnancy
involves a greater risk of
injury to the physical or
mental health of the existing
children in the family than an
abortion; or
(d) there i s a substantial
risk that the c h i l d w i l l be

C l a u s e (b) i s known a s the
" s o c i a l c l a u s e " .
The amendment bill would
alter (a), (b) and (c) so that
abortion would be justified if —
(i) continuing the pregnancy
meant Grave Risk to the
woman's life; or
(ii) continuing the pregnancy
meant a risk of serious injury
to the woman's mental or
physical health; or
(iii) continuing the pregnancy
meant a risk of serious injury
to the mental or physical health
of the existing children.
These restrictions w i l l
seriously reduce the legal
grounds for abortion. Experts
from both the pro and anti-
abortion lobbies have estimated
that legal abortions would be
reduced by nearly 80,000 a
year. Among thse 80,000 unable
to get abortions under the new
law would be rape v i c t i m s ,
unmarried or unsupported
mothers, women who have to
give up their careers to have
babies and women whose
marriages are threatened by
pregnancy. The bill a l s o
contains several retrogressive
c l a u s e s — for instance, girls
under 16 years of age cannot
be advised on abortion unless
in the presence of their parents
— information pamphlets on
abortion would become i l l e g a l .
The b i l l , which lapses at
the end of this parliamentary
s e s s i o n , w i l l probably be re-
introduced in the next s e s s i o n .
It is expected that it w i l l be
more refined than the crude
bill presented by James White.
In the meantime the
Government has accepted, in
principle, the nine recom-
mendations of the Select
Committee on the Abortion
(Amendment) B i l l . Mrs C a s t l e ,
Secretary of State for Social
Services, has a l s o promised
that a motion to reestablish
the select committee w i l l be
tabled early in the next
parliamentary s e s s i o n .

Life - A fate
worse
than death?
A rather melodramatic title I w i l l admit, but i s this not the
question we drum ourselves fit to answer for the unwanted c h i l d ?
It i s considered better to k i l l a foetus rather than allow him or
her to become a possibly disadvantaged c h i l d . We, in our s o -
c a l l e d ' c i v i l i z e d ' society, have assumed the right to dispose of
'unwanted' fellow human beings, because they have not yet passed
through the incident In their life known a s birth.
For example, we could try to
Of course, opponents of this
point of view would maintain
that the foetus i s not a fellow
human, but i s , rather, some
c o l l e c t i o n of c e l l s , to be
removed, like a cancerous
growth, for the benefit of a
severely distressed mother.
However, for a foetus whose
heart beats at 25 days and
whose brain waves can be
detected at 6 weeks after
conception, I can see no point
at which the continuous process
of its develpment can be
considered to make the
transition between non-life and
the human life so demonstrably
v i s i b l e after birth. Therefore,
as the fertilized ovum is already
living and genetically unique,
I feel it is only reasonable to
consider this conception a s
having human life. Moreover I
deem it a gross assumption to
continue removing foetuses from
the womb until such time as it
has been proved that what i s
k i l l e d i s definitely nof a human
being, which proof has yet to be
produced.
However, we must a l s o show
compassion for the terrible
position of the mother in the
case of an unwanted pregnancy.
Indeed, any society which sees
abortion a s the,only way out of
her:predicament must be a very
c a l l o u s and lazy one. Would it
not be better to give the woman
the 'right to choose' by provid-
ing a viable alternative; put a s
much finance and effort into
providing more effective and
readily available forms of
contraception and, also, help
for the term of the pregnancy
and if necessary, thereafter.
remedy the situation whereby
40% of our homeless are one
parent families. One reason for
saying this i s that abortion,
although a fairly swift operation,
is by no m e a n s o n a par with a
tonsilectomy, and c a n result in
various physical after-effects
including sterility, future
miscarriages, severe period
pains and s o o n . Most of these
are caused by the basic nature
of abortion in truncating
gestation; during pregnancy a
woman's body i s geared to
camping the c h i l d , both
p h y s i c a l l y and metabolically
and, thus, any premature
termination of the pregnancy i s
likely to cause these physical
difficulties as w e l l as many
severe and long-lasting
psychological guilt problems.
T h e s e factors lead me to the
conclusion that abortion — far
from being the only way out of
an 'unwanted' pregnancy, i s
not even one of thebetter ones,
even from the mother's point of
view.
Moreover, returning to the
foetus, it c a n readily be seen
that abortion i s not the best
solution for him or her, a s it
leaves him (her) with no
opportunity for any choice but
rather imposes a most barbaric
form of capital punishment on a
vulnerable, innocent human
being whose only crime i s
that of being s o c i a l l y incon-
venient. What price a society
which makes social inconven-.
ience a capital offence within
its c i v i l law?
