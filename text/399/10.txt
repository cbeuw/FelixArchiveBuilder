Ten Years After Ivan Denisovich
by Zhores Medvedev (Penguin Books)
If Alexander Solzhenitsyn had not
suddenly become extremely fashionable
to read,such a book would never have
been published. It is a symptom of the
publishers desire to cash in on the boom.
Anything vaguely related to the great man
(and I am not denying the fact that
Solzhenitsyn is a great novellist) w i l l s e l l ,
so publish and con the public. I wonder
how many people having bought this
introverted book w i l l have managed to
plough through the minutae of detail of
Soviet literary life. It reads like one long
whimpering cry that the world is not a
fair place, which is hardly a dramatic
revelation. It also tends to reinforce the
preconceived nations;of the USSR w h i c h
we in the West p o s s e s s . T h i s is a bad
thing to stem from the book in itself
s i n c e like a l l preconceived notions they
are nothing like the truth. The idea tends
to be implied that nothing like that could
ever happen in the West but that in itself
is demonstrably untrue.
Some words must be said about the
style and content of the book. The book
chronicles the progress of soviet
literature from 1962 onwards. It is written
from the viewpoint of the author with an
e x c e s s i v e use of phrases such as, 'I did
t h i s ' , 'Imet him' and continuous references
to obscure journals.
If you are taking a degree in R u s s i a n
literature then by a l l means buy this book
but if you just happen to be vaguely
interested in the literature and have been
moved by the novels of Solzhenitsyn such
as 'Cancer Ward', 'The First Circle' and
'A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich' do
not get conned.
The Private Future by Martin Pawley
(Pan Books)
Martin P a w l e y ' s first book not related
to architecture c o n s i s t s of a closely
reasoned a n a l y s i s of the trends in consumer
society. It hits home as he argues that
community in the West is gone leaving
only a linear pattern of supply and
consumption. He demonstrates how people
are withdrawing into their private heavens,
buttressed by consumer durables and
mesmerised by the media. The book shows
how this withdrawal is v i s i b l y reflected
in P o l i t i c s sport and entertainment.
Further, ne argues that such life has led
to the acceptance of a preferred m e d i a -
induced reality as apposed to the primary
reality. A s the logic proceeds one feels
that not only may such a situation exist
for the faceless public, but a l s o for one-
s e l f . At this point it becomes a profoundly
disturbing book and one looks, in vain for
a solution to be offered.
It is written in a readable manner
despite the sprinkling of s o c i a l o g i c a l
jargon. The book is full of phrases that
are compelling, for example, "alone in a
centrally heated, air conditioned capsule,
drugged, fed with music and erotic
imagery, the private cHizen of the future
will have become one with the end of
effort and the triumph oi sensation". The
index seems both u s e l e s s and pointless,
but this is only a small point and overall
I would recommend it as a compelling, if
disturbing book. DBH
Concerts Ian Morse
Horslips/
Jonathan Kelly
Saturday night's concert in the Great
H a l l was really the story of an audience
(or at least a manic section of it) taking
over a gig as far as sheer spectacle goes,
the band on stage merely providing the
necessary spark to set off their fanatical
followers on the road to what seemed,
must eventually lead to their ultimate
self-destruction.
A contingent of particulary volatile
Horslips fans had made the journey from
Manchester e s p e c i a l l y to see their heroes
perform. It was quite clear after the
first few bars of the band's set that these
people were out to make the gig into an
event. Spurred on by obvious intoxication,
the scene was more reminiscent of say,
the Eton Wall game — bodies falling
everywhere, groups of fans forming
themselves into rugby scrums and
charging into each other with all the
ferocity of an A l l B l a c k pack - a l l
amazingly carried out in the greatest
of humour. It came as no surprise that
the bass-player of the band appealed for
a little calm, stating that the life-
expectancy up front was about one
minute! A l l this and we were only into
the third number. So it went on, by the
fifth song most of the audience were up
on their feet, caught up with H o r s l i p ' s
particular brand of jig-rock, the Mancunians
in front of the stage seeming to have
some sort of lemming complex, relentless
in their quest to self-destruct.
The overall atmosphere of the event
was further enhanced by the fellow who
thoughtfully chundered by the exit door-
so providing an ideal skid-trap for the
unfortunates who took that particular
path, and there were many. It must have
accounted for at least a dozen people.
Although their music is capable of
much subtlety which they tried to expound
with a few slower numbers, H o r s l i p s '
attempt to vary what was always going
to be a breakneck pace, was an abortive
one. So they gave the punters what they
wanted — the well proven formular of j i g s /
reels and rock equal s u c c e s s , the
musicians being brought back for two
encores.
Earlier, Jonathan K e l l y was given a
generally warm reception. Having
dispensed with his backing band Outside,
which on the one o c c a s s i o n I saw them
perform together, seemed to get in each
others way K e l l y is fully capable of
holding an audience by himself, with
his slightly w h i m s i c a l offerings. F a m i l i a r
K e l l y songs like 'Madalaine', 'The
Curse of Anna Store' and 'Stoned Junkies'
were very w e l l received, K e l l y ' s perform-
ance enhancing his reputation as one of
the countries most underrated folk
singers.
Van Der Graaf Generator - Great Hall
There have been, o c c a s s i o n s in the
past when I found the Stark solemnity of
Van Der Graaf Generator's music little
short of overpowering. The relentless
violent force portrayed in their music was
previously countered by tongue-in-cheek
renditions of, for instance, 'Dambusters'
March' or 'Theme One', the signature tune
of Radio One .Judging by the performance
given by the new M K I I Generator last
Tuesday night, it would seem that they
have forsaken this sometimes releaving
part of their personia, instead treating
the audience to two and a quarter hours
of some of the most incessant musical
violence heared s i n c e Magma last invaded
these i s l e s .
P l a y i n g mostly new songs from the
'Godblutf album [Undercover Man,
Scorched Earth, Larrossa), plus some
vintage violence courtesy of 'Angels
Savours, Refugees', 'Lemmings' and
'Black Room', the band interpreted them-
with great c o n v i c t i o n . Peter H a m m i l l ' s
d i s t i n c t i v e v o i c e piercing the melee of
Mahler — inspired signatures laid down by
Hugh Banton on keyboards and drummer
Guy E v a n s , whilst Dave J a c k s o n with his
array of electric reeds (looking for a l l .
the world like a battery-powered A c t i o n
Man) adding a much needed top to the
arrangements.
Throughout the set, Generator's
intensity level was not allowed to
s l a c k e n for a moment, each number as
vehement as the last, showing all the
subtleties of a d i v i s i o n of Panzer tanks.
Although at their best hypnotically
stimulating, this complete lack of musical
dynamics w i l l , in my opinion be the main
reason why the group w i l l always fail to
win'mass acceptence like others of their
genre.
At the end of the performance Generator
were brought back for an 'encore by a
generally ecstatic audience, although for "
me, two and a quarter hours of walking
the same high voltage tension wire can
lead to positive o v e r k i l l . ,
