Health Centre
unhelpful over
abortion cases
It has come to light recently
that two women students who
became pregnant unsympathet-
ically dealt with at the
Health Centre. In the first case
the stndent had become
pregnant only two weeks before
her examinations. Having
decided to have an abortion,
she approached the Health
Centre and had a pregnancy
test which proved positive.
She consulted one of the
doctors at the Health Centre
regarding obtaining an abortion.
A sympathetic doctor was
unable to help because of the
time factor involved, but
suggested she try a private
clinic. This, the student didi
and finally had her operation
five days before her examin-
ations were due to start —
despite this setback she
successfully completed them.
In the second case the
student, who is still at IC,
was given an appointment with
a doctor who was working at
the Health Centre temporarily.
The doctor was most unco-
operative and reprimanded her
for being irresponsible and
promiscuous. The student left
in tears.
She subsequently had an
abortion arranged for her by
the Pregnancy Advisory Service.
Both cases were brought to
the attention of the Health
Centre who admit that in both
occasions these events did in
fact take place. However, it is
pointed that abortions take a
long time and it was not
possible to arrange the
operations for the student, as
qnickly as they desired.
It seems also that the policy
pursued by the Health Centre
on abortions will not be altered
in the light of these two cases.

Less cash but more certainty-
Government
policy
perverse-Rector
THE RECTOR, in his Commemoration Day address, attacked critics of the higher
education system and government policy on higher education. Although it was important
to raise the educational standards of the mass of people, there would always be a need
for highly selective education for those of exceptional merit. |t was for this purpose that
universities had been created. The quality of students entering Imperial College remained
consistently high and there was no reason for any immediate change in our admission
policy.
One point of concern at IC
however, was the proportion of
women students which stood at
less than 11% of the student
body. "This is far fewer
women students than we —
and no doubt the men students!
— would like, and we are
making strenuous efforts to
remedy it" . T h e attempts to
attract more women to the
C o l l e g e would be a slow and
laborious task. T o help this
and the C o l l e g e a s a whole,
Sir D a v i d Huddie h a d been
asked to consider what
subjects should be developed
at the C o l l e g e i n order to
broaden and enrich i t s
intellectual spectrum.
However, this planning for
the future suffered due to a
lack of certainty over the
financial out lookof u n i v e r s i t i e s .
"In common with everyone
else the College has experienced
severe financial difficulties
during the course of the year,
with inflation almost making
havoc of our budgetory
planning. What has been
particularly dispiriting is the
uncertainty in which univer-
sities have lived".
"There Is a desparate need
to return to some element of
certainty in our planning, even
if in doing so we have to lose
some money," he c o n t i n u e d .
"Less cash but more certainty;
this might be a good bargain
for the Government and for the
universities", he d e c l a r e d .
Referring to the self-
balancing rules for student
residences and refectories he
described government policy
a s "deliberately calculated to
be perverse". T h e C o l l e g e had
endeavoured to make improve-
ments and economise where
possible, but were inevitably
bound by strict government
regulations insisting that h a l l s
and refectories must pay their
way without s u b s i d y .
"That would be perfectly
acceptable if the student
maintenance grant was adequate
to meet the proper costs; but
it is not adequate... These two
elements of Government policy
are mutually inconsistent; they
are also socially divisive
because they penalise the
poorer student; and they
provide a constant source of
potential antagonism between
the student body and its
institution". T h e universities
were " c l o s e to breaking
p o i n t " and urgent action by
the Government was necessary.
He poured scorn oh Lord
Crowther-Hunt's belief that
manpower planning would
result in economies. Manpower
planning w a s a notoriously
inexact s c i e n c e a n d in
anycase it was more Important
to train people s o that ..they
could exercise the intellectual
powers to the f u l l . "Criticism
can be helpful to the criticised,
but if thought to be vindictive
can do more harm than good;
and we must take comfort to
recall with George Moore that
'the lot of critics is to be
remembered by what they
failed to understand'. On that
score alone Lord Crowther-
Hunt was already formed
immortality".
The Rector a l s o expressed
grave concern over the steady
erosion, in recent years, in the
capacity of universities to
undertake research. B a s i c
research w a s v i t a l l y important
and belonged e s p e c i a l l y in the
universities and this should be
maintained a n d not be
arbitrarily sacrificed in order
to maintain a pre-ordained
level of student numbers.
Inflation and Government
financial p o l i c i e s had weakened
the ' dual support' system on
which university research w a s
based.
