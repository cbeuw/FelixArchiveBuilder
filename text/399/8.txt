Abortion Campaign
The National Abortion Campaign was set up in March 1975,
s p e c i f i c a l l y aimed at defeating the James White Abortion
(Amendment) B i l l , legislation which was then going through
Parliament, seeking to restrict the 1967 Abortion A c t .

SPUC-an extremist
group An opinion by Karen Gadd,
Sue Tanner and J Sweet
In these times of economic unrest repressive, extremists
groups are emerging such a s the National Front, S P U C (Society
for the Protection of the Unborn Child) and L i f e . A l l are intent
on the repression of individual rights, which they c l a i m i s for
the good of our society. T o a certain extent these groups are
interconnected. The National Front is proud to affiliate itself
with S P U C , but a s yet S P U C has'given no official encouragement-
to its members to join the National Front.
In spite of their denial of basic human rights to women, a l l
these groups have women members. A t the head of these " a n t i -
w o m e n " movements i s S P U C , a powerful and dangerous
organisation. It has the backing and financial support of many
respected members of our society. It a l s o has the support of many
religious organisations including the Roman C a t h o l i c Church, the
Church of England and the Methodist Church.
Many, influential people sit on the S P U C executive and their
chairman i s the bachelor Viscount Barring ton, an ex—Eton, Royal
Artillery and Diplomatic Service lord in h i s s i x t i e s . They receive
extensive publicity and are frequently quoted, but this has not
always been t g their advantage a s they have an apparent disregard
for accuracy.
Their s t a t i s t i c s are s o wildly, inaccurate that only the extremely
ignorant or g u l l i b l e could possibly believe them. T w o S P U C
supporters have c l a i m that the birth rate has fallen by 99% since
the 1967 A c t ! O r Margaret White, vice-president of S P U C and an
ardent supporter of S P U C , i s quoted a s saying, "Unborn babies
have no votes and they are to be sacrificed to placate extreme
left-wing members of the Party who are restive about the slaughter
in Vietnam and the wage freeze". Prof Hugh M c C l a r e n , who is a
member of the S P U C executive claims that "Most woen seeking
abortions are blondes, quite healthy, with cars. . " .
S P U C pursue a purely emotive and sentimental line of
argument against abortion and accompany t a l k s and seminars with
explicit (and in our opinion obscene) s l i d e s showing the gory
details of a simple operation. They s p e c i a l i s e in blown-up
photographs of foetuses showing their human characteristics.
These foetuses are invariably thought of a s males.
It i s thus that they seek to protect the unborn c h i l d even at
the expense of the mother.

Abortions -

Abortion i s an emotive issue, it involves basic human rights.
The operation c a n be one of the most unpleasant: it has long
term p h y s i c a l and psychological effects. It i s important, therefore,
that the practical aims of interested bodies and the real effects
of legislation are fully understood.

on the phone or in the flat. T h i s involves finding information
from our files on legal advice, emergency accommodation,
local hospitals, late night shops e t c . Often people just want
a chance to put their ideas in perspective. It c a n help to
talk confidentially with someone outside their immediate
c i r c l e of friends about a problem they have with any kind
of relationship.
How do they do it? .
About once a fortnight they spend the whole evening
and night in the flat in South Kensington. They have a
comfortable flat with beds, kitchen unit, bathroom and at
least three volunteers.
