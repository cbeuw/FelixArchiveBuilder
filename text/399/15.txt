Imperial College A's: 4
Chelsea College 1st XV: 0
The A ' s boarded their coach on Saturday emanating an air of
confidence. They had won the previous week (44 - 0) against
Middlesex H o s p i t a l , R C S had thrashed C h e l s e a C o l l e g e the previous]
year.
A l a s , any thought of an easy victory was swept away by
C h e l s e a ' s trick of fielding fifteen fit men, totally unlike those who
confronted R C S last year.
Every IC player threw himself desperately into the fray. Hugh
Duncan abandoned the newspaper he had brought to read in the
anticipated quieter moments. Lynne D a v i e s , on the wing, thought
it wiser to remove his bassoon to the s i d e l i n e s .
The first half was uneventful
but energetic, and at half time
IC were unlucky not to be in
the lead. Slowly things started
to swing in IC's favour in the
second half. Jon Pitcher came
c l o s e to scoring, and afterwards
gave many reasons for not
doing so, each of them totally
c o n v i n c i n g . IC were under
pressure a few times but the
forwards held their own, the
line being cleared by Hugh
Duncan after the inevitable
penalty.
During the whole of the
second half the backs tackled
extremely well prevented
C h e l s e a getting into their
stride. Rod Edney — out:of
position — played well and
gave no anxious moments. It
was the last ten minutes and
then I C ' s fitness began to tell
as John
Fishburn had predicted. A good
pass from a C h e l s e a line-out
found the IC backs ready and
w a i t i n g . Bob Leeson broke
through feeding the ball to Chris
Becque who gave a simple
scoring pass to Jon Pitcher,
and Jon was so close to the
line that even he couldn't
fumble it. John Fishburn narrowly^
missed with the conversion (the
fourth best kick of the game)
but IC had won anyway.
It was a fine victory and
everybody played their part
w e l l , but a special word of
thanks must go to Tony
F i t z g e r a l d who was dragged,
literally, out of bed to fill a
gap in the team.
Many thanks to a l l who turned
out.

Rugby Extras 1st XV by Paul Jeffs
The day started unusually for the extra's with fifteen players
turning up as planned. E v e n t s continued to go well throughout
the afternoon with beneficial factors ranging from a slightly
weakened Q M C 2nd X V to the sunny w e a t h e r . T h e Q M C captains
c a l l of " e d g e " proved correct at the coin tossing and they played
with the wind for the first half. T h i s restricted the score to 12 — 0
at half time, with the IC pack
s k i l l f u l l y demonstrating how to
be twice as heavy as the
opposition, but s t i l l lose
p o s s e s s i o n .
Matters improved slightly In
the second half but there were
s t i l l some Identification pro-
blems within the new team;
Keith Lipscombe was seen
s t i l l pushing IC players off the
ball 5 minutes after the Q M C
forwards had been removed
from the maul.
The final score after an
Impressive last 20 minutes was
46 n i l , with Steve Sharpe, Dave
B u c k l e y and Andy Whiteside
running in one try each, Steve
J e n k i n s and (surprisingly) Rob
Doyle falling over the line
twice each, and N i g e l G l b b s
sidestepping over for a hat-trick
Dave Turner capped a s o l i d
display at full back by kicking
over five conversions from
seven attempts.
The team, every member of
which deserves mention

IC 1st 22 LSE 14 by Chris Cuthberson
IC played their second game of the season on Wednesday,
15th October against their great rivals L S E . The game started
with IC playing with the wind and without anything resembling
rugby. Within a few minutes L S E had scored a try after the ball
somehow slipped out of X ' s hands into the hands of an L S E
player.
However, IC at last began
to wake-up and play rugby as
a t e a m . T h e forwards, e s p e c i a l l y
were much improved and rucked
and mauled w e l l , with John
Smith outstanding in this
respect. After two well taken
tries by M West and A Gregory,
and a try by L S E , Steve A s p d e n
finished off a forward move in
which lain M a c l a i n , P h i l Turley
and Paul Robins were a l l
involved, with a fine try . A t
half-time the score was 16 — 8 .
After the break, despite fine
team play from IC, with N i g e l
Gibbs making a most impressive
debut in the centre, L S E used
the wind advantage to reduce
the leeway to two points.
However, IC came right back
at them, and from a scrum on
the L S E line, Any Devaney
picked up a fine try to restore
the 8 point lead. Despite a
strong late challenge by L S E ,
IC held out well to chalk up a
good win; 22 — 14.
Team:- IC 1st XV - A Williams,
A Gregory, N Gibbs, J Gilbert,
M West, A Devaney, M Calter,

Kenton 'A' v Imperial (or If Six Was Nine We'd S t i l l be o n e s h o r
On Saturday 11th October The Imperial C o l l e g e Men's L a c r o s s e
C l u b played it's first match of the season. The match was against
Kenton, at Kenton and should have been a league fixture. However
due to lack of support on the part of the members of Imperial
College, we only managed to collect a grand total of s i x players
(It should have been ten), so we borrowed two of Kenton's players
and played a friendly match.
A s the weather was fairly
warm, an enjoyable 80 minutes
ensued. It was an end to end
game, in which even the goal-
keepers managed to get into
the opposition's half and much
running about was enjoyed by
a l l . In the middle of a l l this
phrenetic activity one or two
goals were scored, even some
by Imperial, so by half time
the score was 6 — 4 in Kenton's
favour.
The second half was s i m i l a r
to the first, but by now some of
the cobwebs had been removed
from the coordinating centres
of the Imperial C o l l e g e players.
For example, Mike Burke
ofemonstrated his ability to run
about a l l over the place (and
very well he did it too.), and
should be a permanent fixture
in the midfield. Tony, T h e
Happy Hacker, gave an object
lesson in how to miss a barn
door from five feet, but did
make up for it with his five
jammy goals. Our new recruit,
P h i l Varght, played very w e l l
seeing as he hadn't played
before Saturday. With a bit of
practice and encouragement he
should make a useful player.
Our defense, P a u l Jepson and
B i l l J a c k s o n both worked very
bard and did a good job of trying
to make themselves look like
four people whenever Kenton
attacked, for which our goal-
keeper and C a p t a i n (me) was
duly grateful. Modesty of course
forbids me to mention a l l the
incredible saves our goalkeeper
made, or what a good job our
captain did giving much
encouragement and moral
support; so I won't.
In c l o s i n g I would like to
thank Kenton for lending us
two players, one of whom
scored two of our goals, and
for giving us an enjoyable start
to the season. The final score
was 9 — 7 in Kenton's favour

A single goal from a short
corner decided on otherwise
very level and enjoyable game.
Our ladies " d i d us p r o u d " ,
penetrating c r o s s e s from Sarah,
mesmeric dribbling from Janet,
devastating runs from T i n a and
magical tackling from C h r i s .
E x c e l l e n t umpiring from C h r i s
Parker and hard work from a l l
the men made this a superb a l l
round performance.
Our troubles on the return
journey were few, but a
suggestion that we might get
caught in a tube train, miles
from anywhere, brought the
comment, "At least it's mixed!"
