Imperial C o l l e g e 2 Brunei 2
On Wednesday IC 1sts
entertained Branel University
at Harlington and after a hard
fought match, the honours ended
even at 2 - 2 . IC started well
and looked like taking control
of the middle, until a poor
clearance from defence set up
the Brunei forwards who
promptly scored. IC pulled
back :.nd although generally
on top, the Brunei forwards
looked very sharp on the break.
Just before half-time IC
equalised when Trev Futu
latched onto a through b a l l ,
beat two defenders and pushed
the ball through the advancing
goalkeepers legs . In the second
half the play was very even,
IC with more of the ball but
Brunei dangerous and more
mobile. John Latter put IC into
the lead with a goal from c l o s e
in midway through the half and
it looked as though the 1st XI
was on the way to its first w i n .
However s l a c k marking at the
back allowed Branel to equalise
towards the end of the game.
St Marys C o l l e g e 0 IC 3
Saturday saw the start of the
league programme, with an
away match against St Marys
C o l l e g e on an a l l weather
pitch. After waiting for the
opposition to arrive, the game
finally got under way and after
15 minutes IC were 3 goals up,
Trev Futu scoring two and
Nigel Woodhouse c o l l e c t i n g
his first goal-of the season. A t
this point it looked a s though a
masecre w a s imminent but St
Marys changed their style to
stopping the man at any c o s t .
U s i n g these t a c t i c s , the game
degenerated tempers were lost
and the standard of hockey f e l l .
No more goals were scored in
either half although Boodie
Middleton did hit the post with
a glancing shot. T h i s was a
satisfactory result, a s it was
the first win and the first
league match of the s e a s o n .
Special mention should be made
of C h a r l i e Brown, whose k i c k i n g
was a definite improvement on
the previous Wednesday. (Anyone
finding John Andrew's pension
book should return it to him a s
soon a s possible.)

Saturday 18 October: IC 4 Goldsmiths 7
The fact that IC could only muster 6 females mad enough to
play hockey on this sunny autumn afternoon did not deter them
from facing up to a full team of 11 daunting Goldsmiths play,ers.
However a s the match was only a 'frierldly' (and a friendly one at
that) Goldsmiths agreed to loan 2 players to help s w e l l the ranks
of the brave IC team. Another player dropped out to umpire, and so
the teams bullied off at 8 — a-side.
to take the lead. Some fast
moving play followed but a s
tie match drew to a c l o s e IC
Goldsmiths immediately
launched i.nto attack, but our
gallant ' I ' l l try anything once'
goalie played w e l l to prevent
any stray b a l l s gettjng into the
back of the net. B u t , a l a s , after
about 20 mins Goldsmiths
got 2 rapid goals, and w h i l e IC
recovered from the shock, one
of our borrowed players made
it 2 — 1 and spurred on by this
it was soon 2 — 2 , although by
half time Goldsmiths had
snatched another to make it
3 - 2 .
Refreshed by dainty marsels
of orange, goals came in q u i c k
s e c e s s i o n to both teams,
although IC never quite managed
were struggling again and a
final flourish by Goldsmiths
(while IC stood and watched!)
gave them yet another goal
leaving the score 7 — 4 at the
final w h i s t l e . On the whole
however it was not a bad
performance from IC and shows
promise for the future.
T e a m : - Eileen Sproates,
Jacqueline Hawson, Chris
Forsyth, Ruth White, Sarah
Horn, Diana Mounsey (capt),
and two borrowed from Goldsmiths.
G o a l s : - D Mounsey (2), and

IC 2 Guinness 0 by KP Houlden
The IC team arrived early at the G u i n n e s s ground — a change
from the previous week when the team " g o t l o s t " on the way to
Harlington and did not arrive until after 3 o ' c l o c k ! Anyhow the
game started promptly w i t h , it was noticed, the Guinness team
having the unfair advantage of 7 blokes i n the side Instead of the
normal maximum of 6. The game turned out to be c l o s e in fact,
with IC perhaps having the upper hand and although there were
several scoring chances at both ends of the pitch the score was
0 - 0 at half-time:
The second half started
similarly but a s time went on
IC began to co-ordinate better
a s a team. IC in fact had more
and more of the play, and C h r i s
Parker in goal spent a large
proportion of the second half
sitting down admiring the view.
About half-way through the
second half IC took a short
corner and the resulting shot
by J i m Marshall was saved by
a defender's foot and s o a
penalty flick was awarded. T h e
ball was put in the back of the
net by Kim Houlden and a goal
was duly awarded.
The second goal came from
a fine individual display by
D i a n a on the right wing, beating
two defenders and then leaving
the goalkeeper wrong-footed
with a superb shot.
The score remained at 2 — 0
until the final w h i s t l e and
congratulations must go to a l l
members of the side for such a
fine performance. Thanks must
a'lso go to Dave Balderstone
for such capable umpiring
which kept the game well under
control from beginning to end.

Down in the forest, something stirred. Was it a deer? No — it
was a member of the newiy formed Imperial C o l l e g e Orienteering
C l u b !
Last weekend, four members
travelled to Lower Bourne •
Forest, near Farnham, to take
part in a National Badge E v e n t .
A l a n Leaky did w e l l to achieve
a Silver standard on the 6 mile
course, and Tony Warwick a l s o
ran well on the shorter Under-
21 course.
For those of you who s t i l l
think orienteering is something
to do with the F a r E a s t , let me

Sundays and normally take place
in forests. It i s suitable for
people of all ages and a b i l i t i e s
as there is always a range of
courses to choose from, varying
from 2 miles to 8 miles in
length. One can treat it a s a
stroll, or a s a highly competitive
race, and of course it is not
usually the fastest runner that
wins — navigational s k i l l is
just as important as speed.
