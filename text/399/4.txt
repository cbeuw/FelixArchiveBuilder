W E L L S O C
Contrary to expectations, W E L L S O C ' s lecture on Monday,
October 20th w a s not " T h e Future of C o m m u n i c a t i o n " , to have
been delivered by Pearce Wright. T h i s w a s mainly to do with a
certain lack of communication. T h i s lecture w i l l probably-be
given later in the term, eg Nov 17th .
Instead, S i r David Huddie
from Mech E n g stepped into
the breach at the last moment
and delivered a fascinating
lecture on a survey conducted
in IC a few years ago. T h i s
was concerned with what
s u c c e s s IC graduates felt they
met in their jobs. T h i s opinion
of s u c c e s s w a s split into three
main parts: F i r s t l y salary, then
responsibility, and the amount
they enjoyed their jobs. A table
showed how little difference it
meant to your salary and
responsibility prospects if you
had a first c l a s s d e g r e e . A l s o ,
interestingly, an anomaly
appeared at the lower end of
the degree s c a l e : If you are a
person in the 3rd c l a s s Honours
bracket who w i l l probably not
make a 2nd, it appears to be
worthwile to do a little worse,
and get a pass degree instead
of an Honours. But please, if
you must experiment, don't
blame me, or Sir D a v i d , if it
goes wrong on y o u .
One section of the question-
naire sent round asked what
subject the graduates felt should
have been included in the
course, or enlarged upon. T h e
highest scorer? Mathematics,
all the way a c r o s s the board.
The other main area was
management and economics.
MIT conducted a similar
survey of their graduates
recently. T h e survey boiled
down to one basic question:
Are you happy? In answer, 70%
felt that they were s u c c e s s f u l ,
50% enjoyed their job, and 4 0 %
felt that MIT gave them a n
advantage.
I could go o n . Sir David
produced any number of
fascinating s t a t i s t i c s w h i c h
I could reproduce. If you're
interested and want to hear
more, there is a rather rare
report on the IC survey
" a r o u n d " . But in an ostensibly
literary publication, any more
s t a t i s t i c s might not go down
very w e l l .
Opsoc
summer tour report
On Saturday July 19th seven
year's tour company set out on
a l l parts of the country.
On Saturday July 19th
seventy people who made up
this year's tour company set
out on the annual pilgrimage
from a l l parts of the country
to Budliegh Salterton in Devon .
It w a s the eighth visit time
time and we were pleased that
the Devonians were not fed up
with us yet.
We thought that the choice
of production — " P a t i e n c e "
by Gilbert and Sullivan, would
c a u s e a marked drop in our
ticket sales over the' 1974 tour,
s i n c e it was relatively less-
known than the all-time
favourites " T r i a l by J u r y " &
" H M S P i n a f o r e " . Fortunately
over 2000 people came to see
us - a 91% sellout!
The production was not
traditional but set in the
1920's. A n interesting re-
arrangement in the final act
brought the curtain down with a
show-stopping Charleston! -
the audience loved it.
We had booked our weather
for the fortnight and the sun
ty people who made up this
the annual pilgrimage from
shone almost continually
(during the day) which helped
the usual tennis tournament to
actually be completed even
though the beach put in a strong
challenge this year.
On our one whole day off
most people deserted Budleigh
for the charms of Dartmoor and
other beauty spots — ensuring
that they got back to the local
in time for the Opsoc Sing-song.
Our concert .in Budleigh
Church went very well and
made over £80 for charity. The
programme included the Bach
Cantata no 141 (Wachet auf)
the Beethoven Symphony No 1,
the Brandenburg Concerto No 4
and some madrigals with voices
from the cast, orchestra, stage-
crew and front of house staff
taking part. We followed the
concert with the Tour Dinner
at the Grand Hotel, Exmouth.
A l l in a l l everyone really
enjoyed this year's tour and
we hope that 1967 will be as
successful and enjoyable.

The Bar Committee regrets to Inform that due to
increased costs in the college bars, it is necessary
to increase prices, to take effect on Wednesday 29th
October.
This will mean an increase of approximately 1p on
most drinks in Southside, College block and Union
bars.
'Cocktail'
Alter nearly a year of graphic silence we return with "Cocktail",
A d e c i s i o n is being made this week about our workshop but we
hope we w i l l be publishing many more prints this s e s s i o n .

ICWA
debate on abortion
The s a d lack of an IC Debating Society is being compensated
for by a series of debates organised by ICWA. The first of these
took place on Tuesday in the ICWA lounge. The subject of the
debate w a s " A b o r t i o n is every woman's r i g h t " .
The first speaker for the
motion was Karen Gadd. Ms
Gadd, inspite of wallowing in
her own brand of bigotry about
women, produced a very
convincing case.
The first speaker for the
opposition w a s J a n u c s z F i e d l e r .
Mr F i e d l e r ' s argument rested on
the belief that abortion would
automatically lead to euthanasia
and men could treat women badly
and irresponsibly if they be-
lieved that these women could
obtain abortions.
The next speaker for the
proposition, N i c k Payne,
considered abortion within
the framework of our society,
d i s m i s s i n g the idea that
abortion could not exist. He
talked about the horrors of back
street abortion and the good
sense of legalised abortion. He
refuted the opposition's c l a i m
that abortion was murder by
citing the case of test-tube
babies.
The final speaker was Ms
C h r i s t i n e Hands who used the
biological argument by con-
sidering the structure of the
fertilised egg. Ms Hands'
speech w a s well thought out
and thoroughly researched.
The chairperson, Ms Dot
Griffiths, then opened the debate
to the floor. A n amicable and
surprisingly calm d i s c u s s i o n
ensued but unfortunately few
people d i s c u s s e d the points
raised in the debate and used
it as an opportunity to air their
own particular prejudices on
abortion.
The motion w a s overwhelm-
ingly carried.
It seems a pity that more
occasions of this kind are not
organised at this college. The
people who attended Tuesday's
debate a l l asked when the
next would be. There certainly
seems to be a strong case for
setting up an IC Debating
Society. The series of debates
organised by ICWA this term
should establish this point
beyond doubt. It would certainly
be pleasant to see more events
of this kind.
