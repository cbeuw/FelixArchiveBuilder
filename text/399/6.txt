, as
the Super Guildsmen competed in trie Annual S i l l y Sports, outside
Harrods." Here is a run down of the meeting: 09.30: The athletes
met in the G u i l d s Union Office, and started their pre-event warm
ups, name doing press ups, some touching toes, some smoking
and some sleeping.

race down to the wrme, sending a Boomalaha outside southside
on the way.
10.15: The athletes arrive outside Harrods, to find the place
deserted, which i s good for the rag c o l l e c t i n g .
11.00: The events are well under way, however some
competitions have succumbed to the easy life, preferring to hold
c o l l e c t i n g c a n s , rather than exert themselves in the events.
C o l l e c t i n g i s going a little better, a profitable sideline being
charging people to take photo's of B o .

The marathon set out, with shoppers stopping to stare at the
rippling muscles of the Super Guildsmen.
11.35: T h e rippling muscles giving way to ragging flab, and with
several shoppers picking themselves up off the floor, the marathon
came to an end. 4

meeting on 7 October 1975 passed the following
resolution:
The committee of the IC Hellenic Society sees with
abhorrence the spasmodic reactions of the falling
Spanish fascist regime, which are manifested in the
increase of repression in Spain, culminating in the
recent executions.
* Condemns the barbaric methods of the tyrannical
Franco regime.
* Expresses its solidarity with the just struggle of
the Spanish people for the overthrow of the fascist
regime and the victory of democracy.
* Calls for the immediate ending of executions of
Spanish democrats.
