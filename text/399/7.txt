What is wrong
with abortion?
T h i s was the title of a lecture given at Imperial College
recently, by J J Scarlsbrlck, Professor of History, and Pro V i c e
Chancellor of the University of Warwick.
Professor ScaHsbrlck
commenced his talk with a
series of very emotive s l i d e s ,
showing foetuses aborted in a
number of different ways. One
of the most shocking of these
was the Vacuum aspiration'
method, in which the foetus is
sucked down a tube into a
disposable jar. In the process
the body'isshredded by a set
of blades in the tube.
The talk continued with a
number of very persuasively
couched arguements, the broad
theme of these being, 7 s
murder morally acceptable?
Professor Scarlsbrook argued
that a just society was one that
secures equality before the
law, for a l l its members,
regardless of race, creed, and
s i z e . However he omitted to
point out that a just society
should a l s o look to the plight
of the pregnant mother and
c h i l d once It is born, and that
abortion facilitates t h i s .
Merely because an unborn
child Is uneducated, and
u n s o c l a l l s e d this was no
reason to treat him or her as a
second c l a s s c i t i z e n . In fact
it could be argued that an
apartheid system operates
between the born and unborn,
as a result of the total vulner-
ability of-the foetus.
If carried to its logical
conclusion this criterion
formed a very dangerous threat
to our society, since we would
then be bounded to consider
children, and handicapped
people as similar, second c l a s s
c i t i z e n s .
The talk, which was
arranged by IC Catholic
society, ended with a question
s e s s i o n , which lamentably
produced no real d i s c u s s i o n
between the pro and anti
abortion factions. Pro: But
despite this the occasion was
undoubtedly very stimulating to
those considering abortion for
the first time, as well as being
very searching to those who
already had opinions on the
matter. b y N j c k p a y n e

Letter
Knock all extremism
Sir - Having just read the
circular of the combined group
of the S o c i a l i s t Worker and
Hammersmith Hospital shop
Stewards, we were appalled at
the lack of insight and totally
bigotted views put forward by
the said organisations. We are
not p o l i t i c a l l y motivated, how-
ever, we abhor the twisted and
distorted ideas of these
uncelebrated gentlemen.
Why do we not see them
campaigning against other
extremist organisations such
as those who support the IRA
(eg the communists)? It is a l s o
a well publicised fact that,
rather than the National Front,
it is the marxists and communists
who are the main causes of
industrial strife today.
Why point to one group of
extremists when there is an
equally great if not worse
rireat from other political
wing.
Yours faithfully,

Refectory campaign
Sir — Congratulations for your
campaign "tor a better refectory
service. I have one suggestion
about these services, which I
think ought to be aired. On
Tuesday (Oct 8th), I had a meal
in Sputhside, of cod and chips,
followed by apple pie. The cod
was marked-up as 35p and the
piece-of apple pie as 11p. The
chips had no price marked, but
let us estimate their value at a
nominal 4p. Now, my mathematics
states that this should total 50p,
but the lady on the till reckoned
it to be 41p. Being particularly
short on cash that evening, I was
very grateful, but the refectory
made a loss of 18% on that meal.
Perhaps this might be their
" s l i g h t mismanagement problem"
that leads to the £78,000 deficit,
and that because of this, the
40% increase was more than
necessary.
With regards to prices, I have
sampled a reasonable meal at a
Teacher Training College in
South London, for 30p. T h i s
consisted of soup (with roll and
butter), fish and c h i p s and a
piece of cake. T h i s is perhaps
not exactly very nutritional, but
was good value for 30p. Perhaps,
if our refectories were more
efficient, then we might have a
meal for a comparable price.
Best of luck for the future.
Yours faithfully,
Anon (1st year Aero).

CORNER
Tom Abraham
T h i s is the first P G affairs corner of the term. A r t i c l e s from
P G students on any aspect of postgraduate life at IC would be
welcome. Although there were a number of contributions from rank
and file P G ' s last year, we could do with quite a few more since
there are supposed to be some 1500 P G ' s at this College.
Pete Teague and I went to
see the Registrar, Peter Mee,
to d i s c u s s the position of
postgraduate students who
over-run their three year
research period. A s far as
those who are registered as
'writing-up' are concerned, they
are allowed to do a certain
amount of experimental research
work which is related to the
wrlting-up of the thesis . The
sort of work involved would be
either calibrating a system or
checking out experimental
results or even doing minor
experiments to verify theories
formulated to explain certain
observations. While this is
satisfactory, we a l s o raised the
question of the exemption from
tuition fees, of students who
over-run their research period •
due to circumstances beyond
their control. The students who
would come under this category
are:
The rector's comment that
he did not feel that the union
was catering for the post-
graduates at IC is most welcome.
Most of the P G ' s would agree
with the rector wholeheartedly.
The IC postgraduate group was
set up s p e c i f i c a l l y to cater for
postgraduates. It was meant to
function within the Union
structure. However the Union
has not tried to integrate the
group into the Union structure.
T h i s can only be done if I C P G G
is given full representational
rights with regard to P G ' s . It
could only operate if there was
specific postgraduate represent-
ation both on college and union
committess. In addition certain
1. .those who have experienced minimal f a c i l i t i e s should be
ong delays in the delivery of
materials and/or equipment.
2. those who have had to
change their project because
the original one was non-
viable and
3. those who have been
subject to bad supervision.
The college is quite aware
of these sort of problems, and
would if the individual students
department so recommended,
react favourably to any
application for exemption from
tuition fees. However it is not
possible to lay down any
definitive guidelines and each
case would be looked at on its
own merits.
We welcome the open-minded
attitude adopted by the college
on this matter, s i n c e we
believe that it is impossible to
I imit research work to a
predetermined rigid time period.
If any postgraduates are
experiencing difficulties
because they have to stay on,
please get in touch with either.
Pete Teague or my and we wifl
see what can be done.
accorded to the group and its
officers. I would reject c r i t i c i s m
that we are being e l i t i s t in
making these demands and state
that it is time the union
recognised the very different
nature of P G work.
Karl Ibribian? resigned as
P G A O because he felt that he
could not cater for the needs of
the postgraduate students under
circumstances which made it
very difficult to carry out that
job. It would be pointless for
him to spend a l l his time
fighting for the basic demands
detailed above. I sympathise
with him and I would find it
difficult to recommend the job
to anyone unless the union is
prepared to d i s c u s s our demands.
I would however add that P e t e
Teague's efforts on behalf of
the P G ' s is very much appre-
c i a t e d . But Pete Teague
although being president, is not
the IC U n i o n . It is the union
which w i l l have to make
fundemental changes if it
actually wants to represent the
postgraduates at IC.
Council meetings
Sir, — Surely your information
about the 'Shortest Council
meeting ever held at IC is
incorrect. There was a meeting
last s e s s i o n which is recorded
as opening at 6.00pm and
c l o s i n g at 8.40pm — which
appears to equal the time of
last weeks C o u n c i l . Indeed it
was not unusual in the 1950's
for C o u n c i l Meetings to last
less than 2 hours. I suggest
before you make such a c l a i m
in the future you consult past
C o u n c i l Minute Books, w h i c h
are kept in the Union Office.
Yours faithfully,
Jacqui Gerrard
