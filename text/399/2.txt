Reflections until the end of October.
ARIES (22Mar-21Apr): Material gains are under good aspect
and you may find yourself in a financially better position than you
probably expected. Affairs of the heart may cause some strain on the
20th and 26th but y o u ' l l really feel like a ram around the 29th!
TAURUS (21Apr-21May): A s i n the early part of the month,
you w i l l s t i l l be attracting the opposite s e x and enjoying the
affections of others. The main theme changes around the 24th from
work to partnerships th ough the work w i l l s t i l l go o n .
GEMINI (22May-22Jun): Your charming and witty nature i s apt
to spark off an affair (or two) before the end of the month. One of
the most likely dates i s the 28th when you may a l s o find yourself
winning more admirers.
CANCER (23Jun-23Jul); There i s a p o s s i b i l i t y of changes in
your personal affairs if they have not yet occured. It may be that
your attitude towards personal relationships i s changing. Your
prestige, fame and profession continues to grow e s p e c i a l l y around
the 19th and 28th.
LEO (24Jul-23Aug): Mental a c t i v i t i e s and a l l sorts of communi-
cation continue to play an important role. Jupiter brings s u c c e s s in
educational areas especially around the 19th and 22nd and 28th.
These dates are also fortunate for romantic pleasures.
VIRGO (24Aug-23Sep): T h i s i s really your month. Personal
relationships and affairs of the heart should a l l make you more than
content e s p e c i a l l y around the 21st and 3 1 s t F i n a n c i a l l y , owing to
y>ur prudent nature you're s t i l l s m i l i n g and may even have a good
laugh around the 28th.
LIBRA (24Sep-230ct): Y o u may find yourself more interested
in career considerations a s well a s your prestige among friends or
a s s o c i a t e s . Partnerships (cooperation with others) may prove
exceptionally harmonious on the 19th, 22nd and 28th but could go
against you around the 26th.
SCORPIO (240ct-22Nov): Your work and health are both
protected by Jupiter and they thrive on the 19th and 28th Romance
from s o c i a l gatherings and group a c t i v i t i e s is highly probable
particularly on the 21st. Around the 26th your ironic tongue may
d r o p loose and cause some unwanted damage to hearts.
SAGITTARIUS (23Nov-22Dec): A c t i v i t i e s are s t i l l centred
around s o c i a l gatherings, friendships and partnerships. Your
prestige continues to grow e s p e c i a l l y on the 21st and 31st. Many
opportunities exist for romance particularly around the 28th. How-
ever, the 29th may prove trying but don't despair there's s o much
tin in November.
CAPRICORN (23Dec-20Jan): A c t i v i t i e s involving education
could be the source of a romance. E s p e c i a l l y fortunate days are
the 21st and 31st. There may also be extra communication (some of
it behind the curtain) regarding your present or future career. Y o u
really have to wait until the end of November if you are looking for
a b a l l .
AQUARIUS (21Jan-19Feb): E d u c a t i o n and travel is the main
interest. After the 24th you may. become concerned about your
career or prestige particularly on the 26th and 27th. Y o u may also
feel more impulsive on those days. There may be some sudden
fortunate changes around the 15th and 25th. Romantically, nothing
unusual.
PISCES (20Feb-21Mar): Your personal relationships and
affairs of the heart a l l flourish. Y o u may find yourself attracting
many members of the opposite sex and having romantic involvements
but emotions may run a bit w i l d ! If you try to keep things on a
relatively descent level you should be able to find time for work a s
w e l l .
