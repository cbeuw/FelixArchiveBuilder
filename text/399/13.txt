CROSS C O U N T R Y
Last Wednesday, 15 October, we ran against the L S E on our
home course at Petersham and totally annihilated them. Owing to
R A l l i n s o n ' s F . . . t i n g about during the race, ( as w e l l as before it)
The suprise winner w a s the " n e w " ( i e fit) Ian E l l i s , who just
failed to complete the course in under 30 mins (a cherished club
honour.) T h i s w a s mainly due to the ignorance of some sheep who
did not seem to realise that we wanted tb organise a race, and
were busily feeding themselves on our starting line. Consequently
the course w a s extended, Ian w a s robbed, and the sheep became
the target of much abuse. A c l o s e second w a s D Rosen with S
Webb third. C Dale in h i s first race for the club ran well to finish
fourteenth.
On the following Saturday,
the club had to honour two
fixtures, one at Brightonjhe
other at B r i s t o l . T h e tatter w a s
a league race and s o we had to
send most of our star members,
who did the club proud in
finishing as one of the top
c l u b s . R A l l i n s o n ran a great
race and came a very commend-
able fifth. The remaining
members — a l l proven superstars.
P A ' s — travelled to Brighton
to race against Sussex and
Hasting's A C .
For the race IC was forced
to merge with the L S E , whose
shares were suffering from
lack of support. However the
merger turned out to be an
unprofitable one and the team
finished a good third. T h e
highlight of the day was when
M 'Wilf' Welford whose over-
whelming enthusiasm, (which
is an example to us a l l ) had
caused him to run an extra
three-quarters of a mile, finally
finished. A l l the modest lad
could say was "I got L o s t " .

T h i s 6 x VA mile relay was run on an unusually dry Parliament
H i l l course, the monsoons being delayed for another o c c a s i o n . The
first lap hurtled off at breakneck speed and even Andy Davey could
not avoid breaking ten minutes. The first earn finished a creditable
14th, thanks to fine runs from Rob, Ian and Granny, and with a fully
fit team we might well have finished in the first ten.
The progress of the second
team was abruptly slowed by
Pad Donnelly, whose temporary
return from E s s a m ' s (esorted by
his wife) produced very little
glory in breaking 13 minutes.
Owing to the unsporting action
of a couple of teams at the
back, who dropped out halfway
through the race, Mike Welford
was left with the unwelcome
task of preserving I C ' s honour
and not finishing last. Even
more unwelcome w a s the uphill
sprint which enabled us to
finish last but one. It w a s
learnt afterwards, from the
official U C results, that Mike
had been credited with a time of
9.13, which was surprisingly
looked on with much humour
and hilarity. The evening w a s
spent sampling real ale at the
C i t y University Beer F e s t i v a l .

C L U B
The final " B e m s e e " club
meeting was held two Saturdays
a g o at Brands H a t c h . Unfortun-
ately the C o l l e g e racer
developed a bent right front
fork, s o we had to cancel our
two entries. Nevertheless a
hardy group of members left
Southside at 10.30am to brave
cold winds and heavy showers
to spectate and/or marshall.
The marshal Is were kept busy
by a more than average number
of accidents due to the wet
weather and deteriorating
light; none of the riders
however, received Injuries
more serious than bruises. A s
regards the racer, we s h a l l try
and let as many new members
as possible'have a ride during
the winter in readiness for next
season. . ......

W A T E R POLO
IC Water P o l o C l u b took a great step towards winning their
first major honour of the year when, on Monday 6th October they
won the first leg of the Winter Handicap K O C u p R n a l . F o r those
of you who haven't been following this competition avidly (OK
hands up) this is last year's winter, which has been somewhat
delayed. T h e match w a s the home leg against Hatfield and we
started 0 — 5 down on handicap. However for once we roared off
to a great start with C l i f f Spooner scoring three early goals, only
to recapture our more accustomed
style and concede two soft g o a l s
before the end of the first
quarter. In the second quarter
we made further inroads into
the Hatfield lead with a goal
each from Pete McCartney and
Cliff, however it was the third
quarter which proved d e c i s i v e .
With Hatfield tiring five goals
were banged i n , C l i f f and Pete
each scoring another and Mike
McCartney and N i c k with two
goals putting themselves on
the score sheet. Thus at the
start of the last quarter we
held a commanding 10 — 7 lead.
T h i s w a s stretched further by
yet another goal from C l i f f and
one from Rory L e w i s before
we conceded a late penalty to
make the final score 12 — 8.
Thus we go into the second
game at Hatfield on 24 October
confident of a c h i e v i n g our first
ever win in the competition,
though we are again under the
handicap of a five goal deficit.
Meanwhile back in the
Middlesex League D i v i s i o n 2,
a weakened IC s i d e met a
weakened Isleworth side on
Friday 10 October. The match
proved to be a very tight affair
up to half time when we were
actually losing 1 — 2 but from
then on our superior fitness
took i t ' s toll and w e strolled
in for an astonishing 9 — 2
victory. G o a l s came from Rory
'Ignor' L e w i s 4, Pete McCartney
2, Andy Smith, P a u l F r i e z e and
N i c k .
So don't forget if you think
you c a n put up with at least
one of the following (a) water,
(b) yellow b a l l s , (c) Stan's bar,
(d) friendly Irishman, (e) friendly
Welshman, then please come
along to the pool on a Monday
or Friday at 7pm and w e ' l l get
the other four points sorted out.

BOAT C L U B
Dodging the pleasure
cruisers on the river at Putney
can often be seen members of
the Boat Club and here is a
report of them from MR J o n e s .
So far this term we have been
concerned mainly with sorting
crews into eights and trying to
negotiate some fixtures. A t
present we have L a d i e s eight,
three Novice crews and three
Senior crews (The difference
between the last two catagories
is based upon the number of
regattas won).
The novices have been put
into ' c l i c k e r ' boats and are
beginning to understand basic
points such as w h i c h end of the
Ear to hold. Although they are
lighter than last years N o v i c e
eight, this should not affect
their performance and many
good races are anticipated.
The women are running at
least one eight t h i s year and
already have one w i n to their
c r e d i t . A week last Saturday
Gerry T a p l i n in a four won a
pint pot at the Thames Scratch
regatta.
A smaller number of people
than usual turned up for the
first trial. However we are
running three eights of a
general quality above average
for this time of year (some
eights of
members have confessed to
having run during the summer
v a c . ) . The first eight h a s been
split into fours and is training
for a fours competition on
November 1st w h i c h is steered
c o x l e s s and results in an
erratic course down the river.
The training has taken its t o l l ,
with people w a l k i n g round like
robots for a week or s o
afterwards.
T h i s term is used mainly
for technique training s o we
compete in no regattas other
than the U L Winter E i g h t s ,
the V e s t a Eights and of course
Morphy Day. So watch this
space for d e t a i l s .
