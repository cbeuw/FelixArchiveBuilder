UGM Report
A Union General Meeting w a s held last Tuesday lunchtime,
prior to the demonstration organised by the S E region of the T U C ,
although the question of cuts in public spending were not
s p e c i f i c a l l y d i s c u s s e d . No matters arose from the minutes of the
last U G M , and the only correspondence received was that
mentioned in the Council Report printed in F E L I C I T Y on Friday
171th October.
President's report
Formal dinner prices have
been revised downwards after
consultation with Mr Mooney.
Ms C o w e l l , from the D E S and
U G C , will, be approached with
the idea that she comes to
investigate the refectory set-up
at I C . However, due to her
performance at L S E , the
president expressed doubt about
the outcome of such a v i s i t
from her. She apparently fell
down a set of stairs and broke
her leg after only two hours
going round the refectory at
L S E and produced a report
based on her two hour stay I
The president a l s o informed
the meeting of a developing
situation at Q E C (Queen
E l i z a b e t h College) where the
Union there had hired catering
equipment and were paying
students to produce lunches
being sold to students at only
20p per main course. (A full
report w i l l appear in the next
issue of F E L I X . ) Peter Teague,
ICU president, and John Downs
w i l l be investigating the
practicabilities of this system
for IC.
It is almost certain that
S R C finance w i l l recommend
that hall rents be increased
after C h r i s t m a s . The halls
made a heavy financial loss
last year.
T h i s led to a recommendaion
that the meeting reaffirm the
U n i o n ' s opposition to mid-
s e s s i o n a l price increases in
view of the fact that grants
are reviewed annually.
A recommendation from the
president that only one observer
be sent to the next N U S national
conference w a s rejected in
favour of a recommendation
that the delegation leader
reports on the possible effects
a decrease in observers h a s on
a delegation's performance.
Honorary Secretary's business
There was little of general
interest except that an IC s l o p -
shirt may soon be available.
Suggestions a s to what should
go on it are welcomed.
A suggestion, to combat
illegal car-parkers in Southside,
was put forward. T h i s involves
putting 10 inch square stickers
on the offender's windscreen.
These are extremely difficult
to remove and the culprit would
hopefully be caught whilst in
the process of so doing.
Deputy President's business
The theme of the D P ' s
b u s i n e s s , for the second
s u c c e s s i v e U G M , was d i s c i p l i n e
People leaving posters up in
the Union B u i l d i n g for more
than two days after an event
w i l l be liable to a fine and
may suffer more severe
d i s c i p l i n a r y measures if they
continue flouting this rule. Mr
Shakir w a s not pleased to see
that sellotape w a s s t i l l being
used to put up posters — blue
tack is supplied for this
purpose. He w i l l a l s o be
challenging people in the
Union to produce their
registration cards without
which they could be evicted.
Refusal to leave would be a
d i s c i p l i n a r y offence. However,
this part of the D P ' s report
proved contentious and w a s
referred back.
Elections
E l e c t i o n s for foor rep and
one ordinary member of U F C
were h e l d . T h e candidates and
their proposers were c a l l e d on
to speak. Mr M K e s s l e r
(proposed by Mr K Ahlers), Mr
R M i l l s (proposed by Mr J
White) and Mr T Shanks
(proposed by Mr P Ekpenyong)
were the candidates for floor
rep. Mr A Potter (proposed by
Mr D Everett) and Mr R Genner
(proposed by Mr M Wright)
contesteed the post for U F C .
The results of these elections
w i l l be announced in the next
issue of F E L I X . Several
uncontested posts were a l s o
ratified.
There being no A O B the
meeting closed at2-».pm.

N A C Conference
It was decided by IC council last year to show support
for the National Abortion Campaign by offering free use of
facilities for a two day conference, in place of money. The
offer was accepted and an open, national conference took
place the weekend before last.
During the summer, the N A C
and its supporting groups h a d •
found the campaign at a low
ebb. There was no definite
p o l i c y i n view, and different
factions had become isolated.
The conference w a s held i n
order to unify support; to define,

structure, aims and future
actions of the N A C .
Until now, the administration
has been dealt with by an ad
hoc committee of about fifteen
women, c a l l e d the Steering
Committee, who were prepared
to organise p u b l i c i t y , meetings,
advice and i n general to build
the kind of
the Kernel o f the N A C . T h i s
committee had produced a
series of resolutions regarding
p o l i c y , w h i c h were put before
the conference as a basis for
d i s c u s s i o n , to be amended and
finally adopted by a majority
vote.
Saturday morning was used
to put forward new resolutions
amendments submitted by the
various groups. In the afternoon,
d i s c u s s i o n groups were organ-
i s e d , of about 30 people each,
in order to debate the i s s u e s s o
that individuals c o u l d clarify
their i d e a s .
Sunday was designated
decision day. Votes were taken
on a l l the resolutions and
important amendments put
forward by the various sections
and the steering committee.
Most urgent w a s a motion
c a l l i n g for a mass walk out of
the conference to picket the
simultaneous S P U C demon-
stration. It was defeated, being
deemed bad p o l i c y to present a
puny, impromptu N A C handful
in comparison with the organis-
ation of the S P U C demonstration.
Unfortunately, supporters o f
the motion decided to attend
the demonstration regardless.
Other d e c i s i o n s taken
referred to the organisation
of the N A C and its future actions
It was generally agreed to keep
to a single issue campaign and
not therefore to affiliate to any
other groups. T h e slogan 'Free
Abortion on Demand, A Woman's
Right to Choose' was adopted.
It was decided that it was too
short notice to arrange a mass
demonstration by D e c 6th but
that a date w i l l be agreed o n
