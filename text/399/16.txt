Treble overseas students'
fees says M P
DR K E I T H H A M P S O N , Conservative M P for Ripon and secretary
of the Conservative backbench Education Committee, told a
meeting at L e i c e s t e r Polytechnic last Friday that there was no
case for s u b s i d i s i n g foreign students at the present rate and we
should worktowards doubling or tripling overseas students' fees.

by the Steering Committee.
Some k i n d of demonstration
w i l l be organised for Inter-
national Women's D a y on
March 6th. National planning
meetings w i l l take place at
least every two months, and
the Steering Committee w i l l
meet twice a month, both being
open to any interested persons.
N A C aims were established a s
being to make it a woman's
d e c i s i o n to have an abortion,
in practice a s w e l l as i n l a w .
T o that end, to make abortion
free of charge and to set up
centres w h i c h would provide
counselling on a l l aspects of
abortion and contraceptives,
through the N H S .
The conference made i t
clear that many p o l i t i c a l and
s o c i a l groups were trying to use
the N A C as a spring board
towards their own e n d s . In
particular, the Women's V o i c e
group, who see the campaign
as a c l a s s i s s u e . Without
solidarity the campaign seems
unlikely to have the con-
sistency required to achieve
its own r e a l i s t i c aims. It i s to
be hoped that a l l factions w i l l
now work i n support of the
Steering Committee, towards
the aims of the N A C . B:^u..

"The economic situation is
currently not one which can
allow us to be over-romantic.
Harsh reality necessitates the
raising of more money if our
prized standards are to be
maintained", he told the
meeting. A realistic scale of
fees had to be established.
Certain groups of overseas
students could then be
s u b s i d i z e d , either by the
Ministry of Overseas Develop-
ment or by various forms of
Government scholarship, a i d ,
or help.
The increase in numbers of
overseas students, especially

students, together with a
R O N E O D E M O S
Roneo demonstrations are
being held today and on
Thursday, 30th October
commencing at 1.00pm. All
clubs and societies should
decline in British post-
graduate numbers w a s a terrible
indictment. In 1971 two thirds
of the post-graduate c i v i l
engineers were British but
today one quarter were.
T h i s c a l l for the increasing
of overseas students' fees
follows the C V C P ' s suggestion
that overseas students should
pay more.
At Imperial College over
35% of a l l students are
overseas students and they
form nearly 50% of the post-
graduates in the C o l l e g e , tf
overseas students' fees were
trebled immediately IC
ensure that at least one
person from their organisation
knows how to use the Roneo
duplicators. Apologies to
those people who attended
the last demonstration which
unfortunately did not take
place.
would receive a sum in excess
of £750,000.
Trevor P h i l l i p s , U L U
president and N U S E x e c
member responsible for
Overseas Students, commented
yesterday: "We oppose dis-
crimination in the provision of
education. The increasing
discrimination in fees and
other ways has meant that
overseas students who are not
independently wealthy, or
backed by business or govern-
ment are being denied the
opportunity forhigher education.
Three quarters of all overseas
students are self-financed
either by family support or by
personal savings. Exclusion of
those people would make a
mockery of the Government's
position that education for
overseas students is a form
of overseas aid".
