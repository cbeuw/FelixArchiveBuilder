T h i s year's IF/RSM D i s c o was a great s u c c e s s with a turn-out
of nearly two hundred people, Everyone I have talked to enjoyed
it and it was very gratifying to know that a l l our work had not
been in vainl
A l l too often it is a problem
at IF to get in touch with
everyone and tell them what is
going on. However, this time
the Union made a special effort
and spent half the week dashing
from c l a s s to c l a s s in an effort
to let everyone know. They got
s i c k of the sight of us after a
while, but we were very pleased
with theeupport shown by IF.
The food was provided by
us, and if it was not exactly
in the Cordon B l u c l a s s (du
pain et du fromage — it sounds
better in French!), there can
be no comparison to the way
we slaved, not over the
traditional hot stove, but
over what seemed like tons of
cheese and endless French
loaves with only two knives
between us! I think w e ' l l have
to admit to a slight mismanage-
ment there. S t i l l , it was rapidly
consumed by a l l and sundry, so
it must have been quite good.
Three barrels of beer a l s o
disappeared down the hatch
which proves (as I have always
said) that dancing is thirsty
work!
The music began at 8.30pm
and after the initial shyness,
the lust of F a n n y ' s " a m a z i n g "
D i s c o soon proved to be
irresistible. More and more
people arrived, the backs of
their stamped with R S M U , for
all the world like a flock of
prize sheep. Still what better
way of proving that you've
paid?
Anyway, it was getting so
crowded and hot that it became
of paramount importance to
cool off and so, as I cannot
stomach beer, I thought it
prudent to retire to the bar. T h i s
a l s o seemed to be a popular
idea'with quite a few other
people and it began to get
uncomfortably hot in there as
w e l l .
A l l the same, an enjoyable
evening was had by a l l , and
we hope that in the future a l l
such events w i l l be as well
attended.

Overseas Students' Fees
Yet another MP has jumped on the 'charge overseas
students more' bandwagon. Dr Hampson has suggested we
repeat Mr Crosland's 1966 move and treble overseas
students' fees. This will NOT drive overseas students
away especially since our courses are highly prized.
NONSENSE!
If their fees were trebled, these students would be
paying fees of up to £1000 a year. On top of this would be
their hall fees which in some universities and polytechnics
are as much as three times those for British students. In
one polytechnic overseas students are being charged £61
a week to live in halls of residence. However, the poly-
technic is not reaping in any money from this because these
students have refused to live in hall. The average halls of
residence fees for overseas students is at least as high as
the weekly rate of the student maintenance grant paid at
the full rate.
The consequences of such a measure would be far reach-
ing, especially for Imperial College. With a large percentage
of our students coming from overseas the move could prove
disastrous if a large enouch drop occurred in their numbers.
Abortion
This week F E L I X present in the centre pages the various
views of both factions of the abortion debate viz the pro
and anti-abortionists. The aim of the 1967 Abortion Act was
essentially to curtail the number of deaths by backstreet
abortions by legalising it.
The act has been liberally abused and it is for this
reason that further legislation has been put forward to
curtail these abuses. However, the James White Abortion
(Amendment) Bill, which was designed to do this has been
the subject of much controversy and rightly so. It would
have been (it lapses at the end of this session) a restrictive
piece of legislation.
There are valid sociological reasons in many cases for
abortion, but this does not detract from the fact that it is
murder in the strictest meaning of the word.

During the coming s e s s i o n at least one member of ICWA w i l l
become pregnant. Consider her situation; there w i l l be three
courses of action she could take.
college, ?iave the child and
then put the child up for
adoption. (This presupposes
that her parents w i l l support
her during her confinement.)
Hopefully, she could then
resume her studies a year later.
Secondly she could leave
college, have the child and
then attempt to keep it,
resuming her studies this time
with the added responsibility
of trying to rear a young c h i l d .
I shall not go into the problems
of accommodation and finance
that this would a l s o involve.
Thirdly, she could have an
abortion. That i s , at present
she could have an abortion. It
seems abundantly clear to me
which step she would choose
to take, James White permitting.
James White, for those to
whom the name is not familiar,
is a man who would force this
as yet hypothetical ICWA
member into adoping one of the
first two courses of action I
have outlined or into placing
herself at the far from tender
mercies of the " b a c k - s t r e e t "
abortionist.
In 1967 an enormous step
forward was made towards
giving women a real opportunity
to plan their lives as they chose,
to govern their Own bodies and
to be free from the fear of
unwanted pregnancies; abortion
was legalised.
Eight years later the James
White Abortion (Amendment)
B i l l is before Parliament. If
this B i l l becomes law it w i l l
effectively make it impossible
for any woman not in the
following categories to have a
legal abortion. Under the B i l l ,
to qualify for a legal abortion,
a woman would have to be in a
position of risking grave
physical or mental harm by
continuing the pregnancy or
she would have to establish
that the child if born would
seriously threaten the stability
of her existing family unit. T h i s
neatly excludes the large
majority of women who at
present obtain legal abortions.
Once again we would hear 01
girls dying at the hands of
glorified butchers; of girls
being rendered permanently
infertile by the inexpertise of
the illegal abortionist. A
return to the Middle Ages —
with a vengeance!
Consistently every opinion
is given preference to over
that of women themselves. A s
women, we demand the right to
control our own bodies; the
right to a tension-free sex-life
(no contraceptive is 100%
effective); the right to a
career; the right not to say '/
didn't plan for this child, I
don't want this child' but to
say '/ shall not have this
child'.
During the coming s e s s i o n
at least one member of ICWA
w i l l become pregnant; you may
be her, you may know her, you
may be going out with her -
demand her right to choose,
oppose the Abortion (Amend--
ment) B i l l .

Squash Courts
The South Kensington Sports Committee has decided
that the playing sessions on the squash courts will be
reduced from 45 to 30 minutes for a trial period from 27th
October 1975 to 31st January 1967 to enable more students
to use the courts. The charges per session will remain as
at present.
