Many thanks to Scapino, who submitted
this week's puzzle; any member of the choir
who wishes to complain will be ignored. '
Rehearsal Requirement-The Saga
Continues
As you must have noticed (unless, like me, you
had developed an immunity to day-glow
posters) the Choir Committee is organising its
centenary concert next Friday, and because
the Treasurer has lost his, Casio Random
Number Generator, a Working Party is
meeting to decide the Rehearsal Requirement:
that is, the minimum number of rehearsals that
each singer needs to attend. Because the choir
has a slight balance problem at present, there
are separate Rehearsal Requirements for each
of the four parts: soprano, basses, altos and
tenors, and their respective Rehearsal
Requirements come in that order (though I'm
not telling whether that's ascending or
descending order).
A word of warning about singers. Tenors
have extended the practise of lying about their
ability to sing top notes, and now invariably lie
about everything. Altos, however, only sing
every other note in rehearsals; consequently,
any number mentioned by an Alto is only a half
of what it should be. (Isn't this contrived?)
Sopranos and Basses are always truthful
(although this does not necessarily reflect on
their singing).
The working party consists of four singers,
one of each type, and the following five
statements are made at The meeting:
1. The sum of the Altos a*nd Bass
requirements equals twice the Tenor
requirement plus that for the Sopranos.
2. As Sopranos sing three times as many
wrong notes as Tenors, they need to turn up
to three times as many rehearsals.
3. The Altos need to attend one rehearsal
fewer than the Basses.
4. The product of the Alto and Soprano
requirements is twice that of the Bass and
Tenor requirements.
5. The product of the Alto and Tenor
requirements is twice the Soprano require-
ment.
Given that each member of the Working
Party has made at least one statement, the
Alto has made only one statement, and that it is
possible from this information to calculate all
four rehearsal requirements—calculate them.
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday. £5
from Mend-a-Bike for a randomly selected
correct entry.
Last Week's Solution
Of Bars and Bars
This was another one of those puzzles in
which I set the problem, without knowing the
answer, and wait for solutions to come in. The
best solution sent in was for nine string players
to be removed. Three people saw this, and the
winning entry was (oh no, not again) from R
Tan of Chem Eng 2, who can collect his £5
cheque from the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on
Monday.
The first two diagrams show two possible
ways. The third diagram shows one of the
common errors (a lot of people sent in seven or
eight as a solution); can you find the square
(there is one!)?
Another of Perola's puzzles for the Footnotes
this week; it's not as difficult as I would like for
the Footnotes to be, but the difficult one
comes next week
The cyclists and the fly^
I expect most of you know the puzzle of the
cyclists and the fly (or the bulldozers and the
bee) but to refresh your memories.
Two cyclists start twenty miles apart-and
ride towards each other at a steady speed at
lOmph. A fly flies to and fro between one set of
handlebars and the other, until the cyclists
meet, at a speed of 15mph. How far does the
fly travel?
Since each cyclist goes 10 miles at lOmph
before meeting the other, the fly is in flight for 1
hour. So he travels 15 miles. So far so good.
Now let us suppose that the insect in
question has had a hard day. He still flies at
15mph, but each time he reaches a cyclist, he
rests for two minutes on the handlebars. How
far does this fly travel?
