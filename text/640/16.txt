Semi Final
for FELIX
The F E L I X football team
lumbered into action again last
week, playing in the Guilds
soccer sixes at Harlington.
Unlike other appearances this
season, the team lacked sparkle
and were lucky to scrape into a
semi-final, only scoring two
goals in their three qualifying
matches.
The class showed, though, in
their quarter final when three
goals were hammered home in
devastating style. In the semi-
final final F E L I X Met the
Holbein Bulldogs (??) and were,
quite frankly, outclassed. How-
ever, an astonishing goal was
scored by Peter 'Pele' Rodgers
from a long range free kick.
Perhaps the internal conflict
in the side (three prospective
sabbaticals) let FELIX down.
However, to get into a semi-final
was no mean achievement and
I'll stick my neck out predicting
great things for this talented
side.
The Boat Club, disputably one
of the top sports clubs at IC, met
both Oxford and Cambridge
Universities in races over the
weekend. The obvious conclu-
sion was that Oxford are certain
to win the Boat Race, provided it
takes place, with or without
Boris Rankov.
At Reaching Head of River
Race on Saturday over a 2V4
mile course, Imperial took 13
min 46 some 40 seconds slower
than Oxford who won the event.
IC's time gave them fourth place
in what is Britain's second
largest head race.
On Sunday, the eight took on
Cambridge in two private races
over 8 minutes on our home
water on the Thames Tideway.
In the first race Imperial started
well gaining three quarters of a
length lead before being swamped
by a police launch. By the sixth
minute Imperial had drawn back
to half a length down (approx 1
second) when the Cambridge
cox decided to end the race by a
deliberate crash.
In the second race Cambridge
started with a one length lead
and eventually won by three
lengths, going six seconds in the
eight minutes. This was an
excellent performance by the
College 1st VIII, especially as
Cambridge had three stone per
man weight advantage.
The crew is: Box: Jerry 'FT
Index' Thorp; 2: Greg ' Who needs
a full Hack' Harding; 3: Andrew
'Skier' Spa/dick; 4: Bin 'Gozzer'
Bradbury; 5: John 'Heavyweight'
O'Brien; 6: Bollock Brother Nick
Hartland; 7: Bollock Brother Tom
Anderson; Stroke: Bill 'full body
condom' Dowing. Cox: Mastoid.
If the Rifle Club insist on
putting forward their ridiculous
claim to being even average,
then the Boat Club wishes to
challenge them to a two-way
match at shooting and sculling.
Which all leaves the question:
Why can't the Boat Club women
tell the difference between coxed
and coxless four?

Firsts
IC vs RHC 4-1
Capt Andy Page resumed his
personal vendetta against RHC I
with his own version of the 'one-
liner' and in doing so sent the
opposing team captain for an
early bath.
In a mixed game IC 1st XI
fought hard to control the game,
and soon took the lead through
the 'opportunist' Dave Stephen-
son. R H C never looked like
threatening Harlow's Wednes-
day afternoon workout, until
Chamberlain momentarily
forgot that the team had changed
ends at half-time, allowed the
RHC centreforward to run-on
and equalise!
Resolute work in defence by
Dumbo and ex-Bee Gee, Martin
Curran kept the midfield in
possession and allowed the IC
forwards to exploit the labour-
ring R H C defence. A low
diagonal ball from Stephenson
across the RHC penalty area cut
the defence in two, and Flanagan
drove home at close range.
Minutes later, Flanagan again
latched onto a brilliant through
pass to send the ball screaming
into the back of the net. Mean-
while, the referee got his money-
worth, and sent the R H C
â€¢captain off, as he and Page
discussed the 'meaning of life'.
Shortly before full-time
Chamberlain made it 4-1 with a
well placed shot totally out of
character!
This was a good team per-
formance so close to the UL cup
final.
ULU Cup Final
IC vs UC 1-1
Last Saturday saw IC First XI
set out on another intrepid
expedition to Motspur Park, this
year defending the ULU Cup for
.the first time. The pitch inspec-
tion gave all the vital inform-
ation: the pitch was there, it was
enormous, bumpy and we'd
have to finish early before the
tide came in!
They said after last year's final
that the drama then couldn't be
surpassed. They were wrong.
After only a few minutes the ball
was sliding across UC's goal-
mouth, and if only Reeve could
have decided which part of his
anatomy to put it in with, we
would have been one up. How-
ever the first half continued with
the Flying Harlow performing
minor miracles to stop us going
behind. Meanwhile Dumbo
decided that the centre backs
needed a hand and proceeded to
take most of the long through
balls. Half-time came and still 0-
0.
The second half saw us begin
to establish a grip on the game
and if spoon foot Griffiths could
have kept his shot down we
would have gone one up.
Eventually it fell to Rickard to
put us in front and with only
fifteen minutes left it seemed
quite possible that we could hold
out to win. Wrong! A few
minutes later it was 1-1 and then
extra time again.
In the first half of extra time,
we looked like scoring while in
the second half they did. During
that second half Page decided to
have a rest, sitting down com-
plaining of cramp. John Mc-
Guckin decided to pass to him
and we all had heart failure as
the forward took it off the
floundering Page. Fortunately
we survived and in the end it was
1-1 and a replay on Sunday.
