OK boys, the party's over. I
mean what's the big idea?
Congratulations to the Captain
incidentally for his brave first
and last appearance for IC
Firsts. The flu epidemic con-
tinues and has now reached the
upper levels of Southside. I hope
we've given it to every other
London college.
Oxford was cancelled due to
unfortunate genuine late with-
drawals, plus Rupert forgetting
to mention that he was going
sunbathing in Zimbabwe. Re-
garding Germany, everything's
going fine except I'd now like
some money.
Don't forget next Thursday is
the A G M at 12:45pm above
Harry's (NB: elections). Mean-
while, this Sunday evening, ie
two day's time, is the ice-hockey
trip, meet 5:15pm in the Union
Lower Lounge. If you're not
sure, then rest assured—it's an
excellent spectator sport! All
welcome, all sizes of party
catered for.
Friday was the day when nine
mens teams and four womens
teams converged on Malet Street
The reason for this strange
occurence was the annual inter-
collegiate team competition—
this year there was a slight
difference in that the women
actually had a trophy to fight
for, but more of the trophies
later.
The men's B team ended up in
the worst side of the draw, and,
with the aid of their apricot
physicist, they put up a good
fight especially against Brunei
and LSE. Despite their valiant
attempts IC B were unable to get
out of their pool.
The women's team put up a
very good fight and were only
beaten in the fight for the gold
FELIXillllllil ilWIIIllllllllilllllll II
medal and the trophy by a very
small margin, all three women
held their own against more
experienced opponents.
The men's A team sailed
through the pools, and, despite a
nagging injury, managed to put
Brunei in their place during the
semi-finals, and once more
asserted their superiority over
the whole of the opposition by
carrying away the gold medal
and the trophy.
As a summary the result of the
competition was IC one, the
Rest of London Nil.
This leaves only one thing to
say, let's make it the double next
year.
Men's A team: Tim, Graham,
Keith, Terry and Mark S.
Men's B team: Mark, T
Martin, Andy P, Andy B and
Richard.
Women's team: Kathryn,
Caroline and Gabby.
Finally, congratulations to
Keith, who has now got enough
points for his 1st Dan, and to
me, for getting my 4th Kyu (blue
belt).
A warning note: the bit about
us in the IC Radio report just
isn't true, Martin's been working
very hard on his vocabulary.
Basketball
This defeat at the hands of
Paddington College could prove
to be the most significant of our
many defeats, since this game
was basically a play off for last
place in the league. The pressure
is now on us to do well in our
home match against them on
Monday night.
The teams were fairly evenly
matched, and we led for three-
quarters of the game losing out
in the last ten minutes.
A switch to man-to-man
marking in the first half lost us
an eight point lead before we
returned to a zone defence. In
the closing stages of the game,
when we were only two points
behind, poor shooting and
rebounding sealed our fate.
Even twenty-eight points from
our 'leader' Alan Smith didn't
manage to tip the scales in our
favour, and a lot of work will
need to be done to take us from
the unhappysituation of coming
last in the league.
Team: Richard Jones, Thalis
Karagounis, Alan Smith, Andy
Muddle, Ken Jarrett and Tim
Vink.
IC vs QMC 52-82
The game at Queen Mary
College was closer than the
scoreline suggests. A six minute
period at the end of the first half
when Queen Mary scored 24
unanswered points, mainly on
the fast break, destroyed any
hopes of a victory, and in the
end decided the game.
It was to our credit that we
kept playing hard throughout
the second half, but it was only
for the sake of keeping the
scoreline respectable.
Top scorer was player-coach
Alan Smith with fifteen points.
Team: Frank Rawlins, Alan
Smith, Thalis Karagounis, Andy
Muddle, Tammam Hamza, Tim
Vink and Richard Jones.
In the past this illustrious
column has likened shooting 100
to sex. Hence I am please to
report that Gary Smith has
enjoyed his first carnal experi-
ence, climaxing his ton admir-
ably with no sign of the nerves
that have previously plagued his
performance. Declining to
comment we are forced to
assume that it comes naturally to
Gary. Meanwhile our glorious
leader proposed that the secret
of success lies in sexual abstin-
ence. Unfortunately since I fail
to observe any success in the
latter but have noted several
instances of blindness, such as
an inability to distinguish match
cards and a tendency to walk
into trees, I am forced to
assume
Last Sunday saw the practice
trip for the annual inter-CCU
fullbore competition at Bisley.
Despite the late appearance of
Gordon, looking not a little
strained, a full quota arrived at
Bisley about 11:00am. Tragedy
almost ensued before a shot was
fired as a certain person who
shall remain nameless (but can
be contacted via Elec Eng letter-
racks) attempted to lead his
flock across a rapid fire SLR
range. This would have un-
doubtedly decimated the pride
and joy of ICRPC, though might
have put Gordon out of his
misery. As for the shooting
honourable mentions to Jim and
Little Gary for fine scores. This
leaves the competition finely
balanced, for arrangements,
teams, etc, see notices in range.
Last week also saw the final of
the handicap competition be-
tween Mark Bourke and Andrew
Hamilton. After the first card
produced an equal score a two
way vicious smear and innuendo
campaign resulted in Andrews
victory by a single point.
Congratulations then to Andrew
whose consistently good shoot-
ing saw him through.
Following our recent expose on
the activities of certain female
rugby afficionados at IC we are
now able to bring you the story
of their first match.
The international notoriety
and fame of this squad enabled
them to arrange a fixture with a
ladies team of equal standing
and skill—Rugby Club Wag—
another of the top European
Ladies teams.
The match kicked off at
11:30am, and in a closely fought
first half, the 'fiery' IC girls
showed their Dutch counter-
parts, that sheer enthusiasm
cannot hope to make up for a
lack of technique and ignorance
of the rules.
Half-time, and with the score
at 22-0 the visitors had a hurried
and worried team talk—mean-
while Maribel Anderson, the
ever ardent IC captain, sug-
gested that having changed ends
they would be able to see what
. the other 25-yard line looked
like.
The second half followed as
the first, despite the weariness of
our home team. The Dutch
finally struggled to a 54-0
victory, just clinched with a last
minute try by their captain.
The spectacle was nearly as
enthralling as the performance
put on by like minded ladies at
Twickenham the same after-
noon.
Celebrations continued into
the night in the Union. Our
erstwhile captain accepted a gift
of RCW knickers in the Zulu
style
The evening drew to a close to
the muted strains of Glenn
Miller.
Special thanks to Jim Boucher
and John Symes for training us.
Also to all who played, or
supported. And to looney-man
for his help and wit. Finally to
Warwick for his instructive but
unbiased refereeing.
