I'm all right, Jack
Dear Sir
Over the past two years or so I
have recognised a sad fact about
this College; and that is that the
majority of people here don't
give a damn about anyone else.
Take U G M motions about
South African involvement, for
instance. Large numbers of
people turn out to make sure
that they're alright; and whether
or not the South African regime
oppress and kills innocent,
people doesn't seem to matter,
they just don't want anyone
interfering with their education.
As for the education cuts;
mainly the attitude is that we
won't be here much longer
anyway, so it won't affect us.
The fact that it will affect other
people doesn't enter into it. Not
only that, but we're quite happy
to let the NUS do our dirty work
for us, and reap the benefits.
'But the NUS is too political,' I
hear the cry; and my reply is that
the reason this place is so
apolitical is that the students
simply don't care. Those who do
care and act on it are seen as
harmless cranks, happily toler-
ated as long as they don't
threaten our prospective five-
figure incomes.
This is a good College,
academically at least. We haye a
tremendous potential which we
could use to alleviate suffering in
other parts of the world. It seems
lamentable that a lot of us would
rather use it to line our own
pockets, and leave the cranks to
care for the suffering and dying.
Yours in despair

Union Hacks
Threatened
Species
Dear Martin
Peter Burt's threats to kill any
union hack found in the Bot-
' Zoo Common Room must be
viewed with concern.
This harmless, lovable crea-
ture, noted for its colourful
plumage, peculiar habits and
distinctive mating call ('quorum,
quorum'), was once a common
sight around College. However,
exams, the need to get good
degrees and the increasing taxes
on beer have already reduced the
numbers of this species.
The Bot/Zoo Common Room
is one of the hack's few remain-
ing habitats, where it can often
be seen foraging for tea and
biscuits. Any attempt to exter-
minate the hacks there could
ultimately lead to the extinction
of the species; something that
should concern us all.
Yours

confesses all
Dear Reader
I have written this letter to
clear up a few misunderstand-
ings generated by my electoral
campaign. The campaign was
run on a totally joke basis
initially to bring a bit of humour
into an otherwise stuffy atmos-
phere but during the campaign,
having spoken to a great many
disillisuioned students, we
realised that something had to
be done about the running of the
Union. Many ideas were dis-
cussed including the running of
the bars being turned over to the
Union and hence the profits
returned to the students and
other matters concerning the
lives of the general student body.
We decided not to make any
serious policies as they would
have detracted from the overall
effect of the campaign. The
campaign was not to make any
points about the failings of
democracy but to enliven the
dull lives of IC students.
Yous sincerely

Dear Sir
Roger Kingdon writes (FELIX
March 4) as if we were free to
choose a religion for its desirable
social effects. Surely the only
• H H M H M M H H N H March 11,1983
criterion for accepting a religion
is that you think it's true, that it
describes objective reality. Mr
Kingdon also expects his religion
to produce a morally good
society. He expects too much, if
only because it would require the
conversion of all people who act
from selfish or sectional interest.
Otherwise (as with every religion
so far) they will ignore it,
persecute its adherents or
pervert it to their own ends.
Jesus claimed that what he
taught was the truth, and that
the truth would set us free if we
accepted it and acted on it. Only
a minority of any society would
accept it honestly. It would bring
them a personal peace and unity,
but in society it would bring
division and hatred. The ideal
society is coming, but not
because people practise Chris-
tianity—that only affects the
population. God will perfect
it...in his own time.

Walpurgis Night
Dear Sir
We wish to complain about
the total lack of publicity,
concerning St Walpurgis Night;
especially as the Christian
festival of Easter is a well known
event and even has a bank
holiday associated with it. The
problem is compounded by the
total lack of virgins at Imperial
College, thus making our task as
the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse extremely difficult.
Thus, in the same way as 'ICU
instructs' at UGMs, the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse
'instruct':
a) FELIX covers in depth St
Walpurgis Night.
b) All virgins congregate on
the Queens Tower on the said
night.
c) The Archbishop of West-
minster celebrates Mass on the
north side of the Round Pond.
d) Fosters is cheap in the
Union Bar all night, otherwise
The Great Frog shall be called
upon to claim retribution (and
all the Fosters he can drink).
Yours in slight annoyance
The Four Horsemen of the.
Apocalypse
PS: All mail concerning St
Walpurgis night should be
directed to 215 Hamlet Gardens,
where it will be dealt with on the
astral plane.
Sean Davis
Sir
Your comments in Wednes-
day's results FELIX editorial
(March 9) about the election of
Sean Davis as Hon Sec can at
best be described as irrespon-
sible and at worst as back-
stabbing. The electorate, like
myself consider Sean the best
candidate for the post. He is not
a complete unknown, as you
seem to think; or a hack, which
you think is an essential quali-
fication (Quote...complete
unknown has (again) been
elected...for this reason he
should not have been elected...
unquote) and he will certainly do
his best for students and the
Union, given a little encourage-
ment. The last thing he, and
anyone else needs is to be
slagged off before even starting
the job. And to be compared
with Mary Freeman and a
lottery is laughable.
Your attitude is even more
damning when one considers
that you only become FELIX
Editor by being the only candi-
date; and so when someone like
Sean Davies wins an election
fairly you condemn them out of
spite.
Yours aggrievedly

Poster Protest
Dear Martin
I wish to protest about the
defacement of a CND poster,
found scribbled with 'commu-
nists' and 'traitors'. These are
hardly well thought out argu-
ments, rather more negative and
mindless. The communist label
is not true as anyone who
bothered to find out about CND
membership would very well
know. Even some conservative
MPs have been known to have
CND leanings. Perhaps they
come under the 'traitors' label.
Traitor to what? The safety of
the nation perhaps? In CND we
believe the safety of all people is
only possible by the reduction
and final elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
People who disagree with the
principles of CND are welcome
to come along to the organised
meetings and discuss points in a
civilised way. Scribbling on
posters is childish, mindless and
totally lacking in thought for the
dedicated people who give up
time every week to put them up.
Yours in disgust
J E Cox (Ms)
(on behalf of ICCND)
I FELIX
