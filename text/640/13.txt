TO Soc
Lo! A voice said unto me, 'Are you doing the
column?' 'What? Are you joking!' was my
amazed reply. 'No, I am not, you see I have got
this dreadful disease which is...Aargh!'
So dearly beloved, I have been released
from the wordly preoccupations of practical
reports to follow my true vocation as a writer
of the SF column. What is going on at SF
Club? I might hear you ask if I was in the
vicinity. Well, Dr Strangelove was a
phenomenal success (it had better be as it
hasn't happened yet!), plans are afoot or
onhand, well certainly in my head, to hold the
annual, first ever, SF Soc Dinner at the Hotel
Lexham, 7:30pm, March 22, 1983, tickets only
£5.00 (postdated cheques are accepted).
Finally, I asked Dave Langford to come and
give us a talk about writing his first novel, if he
recovers from his hangover.
Lien the brusque
MOPSOC
'Stretch him another inch,' said the Second
Assistant Inquisitor. 'Now,' he shouted as the
order was carried out, 'scum of the galaxy,
decaying remnant of a porcupine's gallbladder,
leprous scab from the underside of a Goanese
lizard, divergent series, talk!!!'
'No,' replied the divergent series.
'I suppose you'd like to become a MOPSOC
committee member,' continued the Inquisitor
in an unconsciuos parody of Ronan Atkinson.
The divergent seris gave no reply. The Inquis-
itor, driven to apoplectic fury, began to stretch
the series more and more. Quite low order
terms began to tend to infinity.
'Will you talk now!' shouted the Inquisitor. In
absence of any reply, he continued. 'Either you
talk now, serve on the committee, or...' he
paused for effect, 'I'll take you to Professor
Chisolm on Tuesday!'
The divergent series realised that he would
never survive this. He felt a strong desire tojoin
the committee.
Chess
Three weeks ago we hosted the ULU
individual championships. In an amazing
display of generosity, our own Brett Lund
allowed our good friend Manky Li of LSE to
win the tournament.
We have accepted Badminton Club's
challenge to a match at a neutral sport. As
you may have seen in their report last we have
chosen darts, as it can be played in a bar.
Darts players, or anyone else for that matter,
are welcome to join any time
Chess Club can now reveal that Carl 'I've no
chance' Burgess financed his campaign hy
winning a tournament held at City University:
And finally, congratulations to Steve
Brocklesby and Jeremy Fraser-Mitchell on
sharing first prize in our gruelling and
enjoyable Random Openings tournament last
weekend.
