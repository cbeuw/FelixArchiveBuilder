Simon Rodan, realising his hack credibility is
slipping, is determined to go down fighting. To
this end he is squeezing the last life-blood out
of a wearied and wearisome issue and has
reached some surprising conclusions
NUS Grovel
On February 10 I went to Endsleigh Street to the offices of NUS to find
out some facts about the organisation, how it functions, what it does
and how much it costs. Most important of all I went to find out how
much it would cost us and how badly NUS wanted us back in by the
level of concessions they were prepared to offer on planned re-entry
terms.
Firstly let me put the record
straight regarding allegations
people make abut inefficency,
bureaucracy and waste. NUS has
a job to do and it approaches that
job in a most professional way.
Their offices are cramped and
austere. By comparison, our
Union Office is the epitome of
luxury. In a room the size of
Stephen Goulder's office you
will find four or more people
working at desks separated only
by temporary partitions.
Is this the sort of affluence
and waste one hears about so
often?
Some of you who read London
Student may recall that the NUS
staff went on strike a little while
ago. Ah, I hear-you say, look at
the incompetent buffoons, they
can't even administer their own
permanent staff. The reality is
very different. In an attempt to'
increase efficiency of working
practices and thus reduce costs,
the executive were cracking the
whip with ever more force until,
in November, a breaking point
was reached. Perhaps they
wanted just that shade too much
from their staff, but believe me,
that is the sign of a healthy
organisation not a sick one. I
would suggest that a parallel
could be drawn between NUS
and BL in that each are emerging
from a period of decline through
the efforts of their respective
leadership to instil a sense of
purpose and streamline the
efficient running of the organisa-
tion. According to its President,
Neil Stewart, NUS is now in a
better position both politically in
terms of stability and in financial
terms than it has ever been
before.
What would NUS cost us? The
figures being bandied about by
the anti camp hover around the
£20,000 or more mark, while the
pro faction will suggest the
£10,000 is the most we would be
liable for.
In fact the figure NUS gave us
is £13,300 including conference
feel. I will state that again: our
total subvention to NUS will not
exceed £13,300, including con-
ference fees. If anyone tells you
otherwise they've got their facts
wrong. The expense, therefore is
not excessive and should not
figure in the NUS debate. If
there is a will to re-join NUS as a
matter of principle—which is
really what the issue is all
about—we must be prepared to
make some small sacrifices to
cover the cost.
Incidentally, Alan Watson,
NUS financial officer is confi-
dent that by looking through the
union finances, we can find ways
of saving £13,000 from our
budget without in any way
lowering the standards of
amenities IC Union provides for
our students.
What about phasing our
entry? Certainly this would be
desirable; it would also give
Alan Watson some time to
tighten up more areas of dupli-
cation and come up with at least
some of the subvention.
NUS are prepared to offer a
three year phased entry whereby
we pay nothing the first year,
should we rejoin in the summer
term, one third the next, and two
thirds the year after, rising to the
full whack in the fourth year.
This perhaps gives a measure of
how much NUS would like a
college with Imperial's prestige
back in the fold, since they
would be offering this scheme
despite strong objection from a
large number of colleges already
in the NUS.
So there you have it, the facts
in black and white. I would
suggest that it is now high time
the issues were discussed; it is
now over four years since NUS
was last debated on a College-
wide basis. If anyone has any
further queries regarding NUS I
would be glad to try and answer
them.
