Wanted:
Virgins!
Ian Bull, the Athletics Clubs
Committee chairman, has been
attempting to set up an official
Devil Worship society at Imper-
ial College. He has already
drafted a constitution and
obtained the requisite number of
signatures for official acceptance
by the Social Clubs Committee.
The society will have as its
officers such posts as High
Priest, Altar Minder, and Virgin
Procurer, and will devote itself
to 'worship of the Devil, Lucifer,
the Prince of Darkness.'
Mr Bull is not being taken
completely seriously in his
attempt, and the new society is
widely regarded as a means of
poking fun at the Social Clubs
Committee and its chairman,
Jonathan Miller. SCC has many
member societies devoted to
fringe religions, and the Devil
Worship Society is seen as an
attempt by Mr Bull to mock
what he considers an easy way of
forcing the Union to grant
concessions.

Only 23% of engineers can speak
and write persuasively, accord-
ing to a report by researchers of
the School of Electronics and
Electrical Engineering of Leices-
ter Polytechnic. The report,
investigating the appropriate-
ness of British engineering
education, is based on a sample
of 250 graduate engineers and
goes on to say that besides
lacking skills in communication,
engineers are not given enough
financial and managerial train-
ing and should be more prac-
tically oriented to avoid a rude
shock when entering industry.

Peter Burt, the current Life Sciences Dep Rep, was elected to the post
of External Affairs Officer and Barry Franklin to that of Welfare
Officer at the Results Union General Meeting yesterday afternoon.
Mr Burt was returned with a comfortably large majority, but after a
recount in the other election Mr Franklin defeated his only opponent by
less than ten votes.
The meeting accepted the
Elections Committee's ratifica-
tion of the sabbatical elections
and the results, provisionally
announced on Tuesday evening,
are now official. Gaynor Lewis
will be next year's President,
Christine Teller the Deputy
President and Sean Davis the
Honorary Secretary. Pallab
Ghosh won the election for
FELIX Editor.
Mr Ghosh has promised to
make plenty of enemies in his
term of office and, in a short
address to the UGM, declared
his intention to start imme-
diately. No sooner had he said
this than members of the Guilds
hit squad entered the hall and
pressed shaving foam pies into
the faces of the new Exec and
also (to his admitted surprise)
delivered one to Mr Ghosh
himself.

who carried out the raid but they
were beaten off by John Mc-
Callion, Nick Pyne, and others.
