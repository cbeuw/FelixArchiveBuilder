Sabbatical Elections
Apart from congratulations and
commiserations to the various
candidates as appropriate there
isn't very much more to be said
about the elections, except for
one rather disturbing promise in
one of the handouts.
Pallab Ghosh in his leaflet
headed 'Truth, Justice and the
Student Way' says that a contro-
versial newspaper can easily lead
to the 'oft quoted "us and them"
situation'. He says this in tones
of enthusiasm and it is obviously
his intention to do all he can to
encourage such a split.
Quite rightly he sees FELIX
as a valuable medium for
campaigning for the student
cause, but he seems to think this
is necessarily best achieved by
deliberately antagonising Col-
lege. As Steve Marshall's
FELICES showed, all this tactic
achieves is that College fail to
take F E L I X seriously and,
ultimately, begin to wonder
whether a Union which holds
EDITORIAL
such an extremely aggressive
attitude is worth so much
money.
There are times when, as
Pallab said, the editor should be
prepared to be outspoken. Of
course College should be critic-
ised when it's appropriate, but it
isn't the most subtle of attitudes
to set out to annoy them from
the start. He said in the cam-
paign that an editor should not
adopt a middle-of-the-road
approach simply to avoid
making enemies. True, but
conversely an editor shouldn't
make enemies just to avoid
adopting a middle-of-the-road
approach.
Social Colours
Any full member of the Union
may nominate any other mem-
ber for Social Colours which are
awarded for 'significant contri-
bution to College social life'.
Nominations, together with
seventy-odd words of justifica-
tion must reach Andy Grimshaw
by the end of term.
End of Term
Doesn't time fly when you're
enjoying yourself! We've nearly
"reached the end of term and, as
usual, there will be no FELIX on
the penultimate Friday; the next
F E L I X , the last before the
holiday, will be on Wednesday
March 23 and the copy deadline
for this will be Friday March 18
at 1:00pm. Sorry I forgot to
warn you of this last week.
Rhyno
At last someone has volunteered
to write a regular humorous
column. Rhyno's first offering is
on page 7. Let me know what
you think.
Impossible without
Adrian James and Olivo Miotto
for news, Peter Hobbis for
photographs, Pinocchio and
Walkabout-Looksee for their
respected columns, Tim Noyce
for cartoons (including the
birthday cake), Chris Mallaband
for sport, Diane Love, Melanie
Steel and Shweta Otiv for
What's On, Nick Bedding, Nick
Hill, Mark Smith, and Lee
Paddon for reviews, the ultra-
reliable Caroline Foers for
•clubs and societies, Tony Atkins
for his page, Gastropod and
Cordon Bleugh, Rhyno, all the
pasters-up, but especially Lynne
James and Lawrence whose
surname I have forgotten; and
Maz and Pete the Print.

TALES OF Nick Gardner last
week didn't leave Stephen
Goulder unprepared, and so
when a phone call from a
distinguished-sounding male
voice caught Stephen alone in
his office one morning, he was
immediately on his guard.
'Could I speak to Mr Goulder,
please?' the voice intoned, as
Stephen, with mounting despair,
looked round vainly for one of
his minions to take the call.
'What was it you wanted to
speak to Mr Goulder about?'
parried Stephen, preparing
himself for anything from
combine harvesters to love-
affairs with Union Officers.
'It's a matter of private
business, I'm afraid. Is Mr
Goulder not available?'
'Well, who shall I say wants to
speak with him?'
'This is John Smith, the
College Secretary...'
And happily, Stephen being a
master at blustering his way out
of embarrassment, was able to
muster sufficient heartiness to
cover his confusion.
I WAS MOST grateful for the
implied compliment paid me by
F E L I X Editor-elect Pallab
Ghosh two weeks ago. You may
remember that in FELIX 638 I
wrote a paragraph lampooning
the performance of our Honor-
ary Secretary. On the day of its
publication I received no less
B E L O W
than three visits from Guilds hit
squad. Then, at 5:30 that
evening, Pallab plastered Col-
lege with the message 'A Good
FELIX Editor Makes Plenty of
Enemies'. Nice to know who
your friends are.
THEY DO SAY you shouldn't
kick someone when they're
down, but I don't see why you
shouldn't, especially when the
someone makes himself such an
easy target as Andy Grimshaw.
As Honorary Secretary he has
been harmless enough, locked
away in his office where he can't
do too much damage; this week,
though, he has donned his
Returning Officer's hat which
requires of its wearer a large
quantity of initiative and
common sense, two qualities for
which Grimwash is not re-
nowned. In consequence he has
been scuttling about College
with all the relaxed confidence of
a mother hen trying to eliminate
any trace of bias in the elections.
STOIC were the first to be
moaned at. For their election
special, some of their technicians
made a large 'Hustometer' to
register the applause for the
various candidates' speeches at
the Hustings UGM. The Husto-
meter was never used, since

~i~i~i~ri~i~i~i~i L rri~i~i~i~i~i i i i i i i
Grimwash felt it might prejudice
the voting; he was only prepared
to tolerate its use if it registered
exactly the same reading for all
the candidates. One might
understand his attitude if anyone
watched STOIC anyway
But on to the elections them-
selves. Doubtless you noticed
that the ballot boxes are all
sealed up with red tape and
sealing wax. The purpose of
sealing wax is, of course, that
before it sets it will take the
impression of a signet ring so
that if anyone should break and
re-attach the seal it is immedi-
ately obvious that the wax has
been tampered with. Grimwash
didn't bother with an impression
in the wax: He said that no one
would bother to take the trouble
to break and remake the seal
anyway. Since at least one of the
ballot boxes was returned with
the seal broken, it seems he was
right.
Still, the boxes were all
locked, each with its individual
padlock through its individual
hasp, and...each with its indivi-
dual-key tied to the ballot box by
another length of red tape.
When Welfare Officer Jon
Barnett queried this Grimwash
was ready with razor-sharp
logic.
'If we removed the keys,' he
explained 'they would all get
mixed up, and it would take ages
to sort out which key opened
which box'. Nevertheless in the
face of more incredulous queries
our gallant hero undertook this
daunting task, and on Tuesday
morning all the keys had been
removed from the boxes.
But the incident which caused
most alarm was the total loss of
an entire voting station—ballot
box, papers, lists and all—early
on Monday afternoon. An alarm-
ed and totally bewildered
Returning Officer dashed into
the FELIX Office and frantically
asked if anyone had seen the
ballot box which should have
been in the Bot-Zoo tea room,
All the FELIX staff denied any
knowledge of its disappearance,
whereupon Andy fled the office,
more panicky than ever, and,
returning only to make his
customary cry of 'Don't publish
this!' dashed into the middle of
the quad and started running
round in small circles when he
realised he didn't know where to
start looking.
Eventually the FELIX Editor
decided to make some discreet
enquiries and asked one of the
candidates who happened to be
passing. Christine Teller ex-
plained that of course the ballot
box had been taken from Bot-
Zoo, and didn't Andy know that
that box is moved to the Union
Lower Refectory from 11:30 to
2 o'clock? Apparently not.
