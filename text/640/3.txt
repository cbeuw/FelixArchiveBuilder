Improper Suggestions
A lecturer in the Department of
Computing came in for strong
criticism after he canvassed for
one of the Union's election
candidates during a lecture on
Monday.
Mr Roger Bailey was showing
slides to a hundred first year
computing students when he
included a slide advising them to
vote for Colin Cooper, one of
the candidates in the election for
Deputy President. He then went
on to tell his students that if they
had not already made up their
minds about the subject, they
should vote for Mr Cooper. He
also referred to the other
candidates as a 'bunch of
wankers'—a remark which the
class took in good humour.
When questioned later, Mr
Bailey told FELIX his impres-
sion of ICU was that Union
Officers spent most of their time
stabbing each other in the back,
and that in his opinion Mr
Cooper was not the sort of
person to do that. He denied
having referred to the other
candidates as 'wankers'.
ICU President Stephen Goul-
der has sent a letter of complaint
to Professor Lehman, head of
the computing department,
describing Mr Bailey's be-
haviour as offensive and consti-
tutionally unacceptable inter-
ference. He also requested an
apology to the other candidates.
In the event, the result of the
election was not affected, as Mr
Cooper, who was not aware of
Mr Bailey's intentions, lost to
Christine Teller.
Election
Rules OK
The Elections Committee last
week rejected Lee Paddon's
complaint about advertising in
sabbatical elections.
Mr Paddon had lodged a
complaint that Pallab Ghosh,
his opponent in the election for
FELIX Editor and now next
year's Editor-elect, had exceeded
the £45 limit on advertising. Mr
Ghosh submitted a signed
receipt from Mistral Print, the
firm that had printed his posters
and hand-outs, and as the
Committee could find no breach
of election rules, Mr Paddon's
complaint was turned down.
New Dean
Professor E T Brown of Mineral
Resources Engineering is to
become the new Dean of the
Royal School of Mines. The
Rector announced the appoint-
ment on March 3. Professor
Brown will take up his post on
September 1 for a period of three
years.
Bot-Zoo
The sale of tea and coffee in the
Biology Common Room was
indefinitely discontinued last
week. Mrs Shirley Veary, the
regular tea-lady, is not well and
is not expected to be able to
resume her work. Students and
staff had been running the shop
themselves for three weeks, but
it was decided last week that
they would be unable to con-
tinue.
Hockey
Club Win
UL Cup
Against enormous odds IC
Hockey Club triumphed over St
Thomas's Hospital in the final of
the UL Cup at Motspur Park on
Wednesday.
A ruling by UL Hockey Club
on Monday night meant that IC
had to play the semi-final on
Wednesday morning followed
by the final the same afternoon.
St Thomas's had already played
their semi-final the week before.
The semi, played at 10:30
against Guys Hospital, was an
extremely hard-fought game. At
full time the score was 2-2. and
after half an hour of extra time
IC ran out 4-2 winners.
The final commenced at
3:00pm.
Again at full time the scores
were level at 1-1, and after
another 30 minutes of extra time
the score remained the same.
The game was then decided on
penalty flicks, five taken by each
side, and College converted 4 to
St Thomas's 2.
