Last week the College Flag flew
in honour of Dr. Jon Stephenson, an
ex-R.C.S. Geologist who had just
reaohed the South Pole with Dr. Vivian
Fuohs and the Commonwealth Trans-
Antarctic Expedition, thus making yet
another contribution to the great
pioneering record of Imperial College.
Jon, or "Steve" as he i s known here,
was born i n Brisbane, Australia, i n
1930 and educated at Queensland Univer-
sity where he won the medal for Geology
two years running before graduating i n
1952.
During his course of study he spent
a great deal of time out i n the open.
He beomae President of a seleot society
known as "The Queensland Bush Walking
Club" whose activities ranged from
rambling through unknown bush country
to "knocking off" virgin peaks.
The award of the 1851 Exhibition
Scholarship brought Steve to I.C. i n
1954, and he made an immediate impact.
While studying Petrology here he
devoted much time in organizing and
taking a leading part in the Mountain-
eering Club's activities, which
included a successful meet in the
Alps in the summer of '55- He later
became Vioe-President of the club.
He also rowed for the Boat Club and
won the I.C. Novioes and Junior
Sculling Championships, at the same
time being President of the Overseas
Students Association and a member of
the Library Committee. In addition
he was one of the primary movers in
the formation of the Exploration
Board.
Although he had had no previous
experience of Arctic conditions, he
was selected in 1955 to go on the
Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedi-
tion, and he left London in November
1956 on board the Magga Dan.
He spent the winter at South Ice
In a temperature of minus 100°F., and
carried out geological surveys by
sledge. On one occasion he was loot
in a "white-out" for llf days before
being located by aircraft Just before
his food supplies ran out.
During the main expedition with
Fuohs this summer, from Shackleton
Base to the Pole, Steve and another
member of the party travelled with
dog teams up to 40 miles i n advance
of the mechanised party in order to

survey the route. I.C. can be justly
proud of Jon Stephensor.' s achievement
in the same arduous conditions that
provoked his illustrious predecessor,
Captain Scott,to write: "0 God. What
a hell this plaoe i s ! "

Did you go to the Dancing Club
hop last Saturday? What did you think
of the girls? Three FELIX staff re-
porters went along to find out what
the girls thought of you. Twenty-seven
members of the gentle sex were asked
their honest opinions of the men. How
interesting are they? What do they
talk about? Can they dance? Will you
corns here again?
To the everlasting credit of I.C.
no distressed damsel aotually came
out with "Hot at a l l , nothing, no and
never" hut most had their doubts on
at least one score.
Perhaps the frankest and certainly
the least complimentary were voiced by
a not unattractive girl who had been
to I.C. hops before. "Most of the men
can't dance. Only one in seven is at
all interesting — most are quite
young mentally and their conversation
is very t r i v i a l . " "Will you come
again?" "I suppose so. They don't
drink as much here as at other places.*
In oontrast were some self-posses-
sed dramatic students who had come up
from Sldoup for the evening. Oh yes,
the men were quite interesting, thank
you, and the dancing above average.
Usst were very young, though. They
Just stood around most of the time,
and their conversational repertoire,
when brought into action, did not
extend beyond "Do you come here often?
Which oollege are you at? where do
you come from?"
One very charming girl thought
that the men were "pretty awful —
very dead." Her equally charming friend
was more sympathetic: "I think they're
just shy." They both wanted older men.
Oh, and did we have any taller ones
about? (Entertainments Committee please
note.)
So much for the men's ineptitude.
Why on earth did women come at all?
many liked the friendly atmosphere,
although one or two thought i t a bit
strained at first, and the numbers
were about right for comfortable
dancing. "Tour hops are better than
the average college hop, I think."
Anyway, there were usually one or two
interesting men around.
