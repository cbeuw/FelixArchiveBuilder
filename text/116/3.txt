The City and Guilds Motor Club
bald a driving test meeting at Hasten
Aerodrome on Sunday 19th January.
About 20 cars turned up, varying from
a T.R.3 to an Austin 7 some 3° years
older. Conditions on the airfield
were fairiy good, although a cold wind
made a saloon car the most enviable
prospect.
Some light entertainment was provi-
ded before the start by John Thurston,
who decided to try out his brakes
without realizing that he was on a
patch of gravel. The result was some
very interesting circular motion
culminating in a tyre burst. The start
then had to be delayed while he put his
spare wheel on, which appeared to have
the a i r showing through i n several
places.
The f i r s t test was a forward and
reverse wiggle woggle, i n which the
smaller cars found that they had a
definite advantage. It was followed

At the f i r s t Mock Parliament
which sat i n Ayrton Hall on Thursday
a government provided by the Conserva-
tive Society was assailed and supported
by about forty allegedly independent
M.P.s.
After a statement of policy by
the Prime Minister and a reply by the
leader of the opposition, the house
debated a motion of confidence in the
government's financial policy. The
government was itself oozing confidence
but could not spread any of i t to the
opposition.
A b i l l to restriot the oapital of
Trade Unions failed to get i t s seoond
reading after a violent debate whioh
served principally to expose the main
differences between government and
opposition.
ihe last item on the order paper
was a debate on foreign affairs, with
particular reference to the hydrogen
bomb. A l l the ourrent topios received
mention, some i n great detail. Perhaps
however, the suggestion of replacing
the Suez Canal by bicycle-borne water-
ing-oans was intended to be frivolous.
The debate was prolonged by many inter-
jections on points of order and inform-
ation of varied nature.
The opposition pressed for a divi-
sion i n whioh the government suffered
a major defeat. Ho more business

session ended.
by a width judging test, where the
competitors had to estimate from a
distance of 25 yards the least gap
through whioh they could get their
In the third test, competitors
were timed from passing one line to
stopping astride the next. Here
spectators were treated to the sight
of a T.R.3 disappearing into the dis-
tance with locked wheels. Next came
a garaging test, in which John
Thurston put up the fastest time,
bald tyres notwithstanding.
The wheel changing test which
followed really separated the sheep
from the goats; T. Wadsworth took
63 seconds with his Austin Nippy,
while G. Rothman i n a T.R.2, having
never changed a wheel before, relied
on the s k i l l of his lady passenger!
After tightening remaining wheel
nuts, oompetitors proceeded to a "Le
Mans" start and 100 yard sprint. The
best time was put up by G. Howard i n
a Volkswagen.
The simplest, and most entertaining
test followed immediately after lunch.
Competitors had to describe the smallest
possible circle, starting and finishing
in a garage as shown. The best time
was put up by J. White, i n a Morris
special, at the expense of a good deal
of rubber.
The next test defies description,
involving a l i t t l e b i t of everything.
The final one was a sprint including
a figure of eight, in which W. Wilt-
shier managed to l i f t one wheel of his
Vauxhall 10 saloon at least 12 inches
in the air.
H. Panton, despite a leg in plaster,
in an Austin Ruby, and the opposition of
several modern sports cars, was the
outright and handicap winner, G. Howard
obtained the seoond prise on handicap.

On 21st January the Society debate*!
the Motion "That this House believes
that Man made God i n his own Image."
Dr. Allan, who proposed the motion,
made out the case for the application
of the scientific method to religious
questions. He did not think that man1
s
concept of God could withstand such a
rigorous examination.
The Rev.
Cleverley Ford thought Dr. Allan was
off the point, and that when he had
been on the point, his explanation of
l i f e had been far too small. Mr. J.D.
Cole spent his time i n demonstrating
items of illogicality i n Mr. Ford's
speech, while Mr. David New said that
the law of discovering the truth of
things also applied outside the labora-
tory.
Speeches from the floor had to be
curtailed, unfortunately, owing to lack
of time, but the Chairman, Mr. Peter
Jarman.had a distinctly realistic
approach to this problem. The Rev.
Cleverley Ford i n his summary pointed
out that some Christians work as well
as pray, while Dr. Allan, in suraiing
up, said that the number of ears deaf
to religion was increasing. At this
point a frightful bearded gentleman
entered the Geology Lecture Theatre
and said: "Time,gentlemen,please"
so loudly that not even the deafest
ears could f a i l to hear. The motion
was defeated by 16 votes to 10 with
a large number of abstentions.
The remainder of this term's
debates will, i t is hoped, be held in
the Concert Hall. On February 11th
the College is being visited by a
touring American team, who are said to
be first class. It i s also hoped to
have a joint debate with Westfield
College at some time.
