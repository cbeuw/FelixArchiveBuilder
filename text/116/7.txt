When sight members of the society
caught the 1.48 p.m. slow train to
Redhill on Wednesday, the 22nd January,
they were luoky to have a snowy day.
This caused certain delays to traffio
and mads the v i s i t more interesting
than i f everything had been going to
plan. Arriving there, we went to
Traffic "mtrol Offices where we
were met by the District Operating
Superintendent and an assistant who
acted as our guides for the visit.
The control room i s staffed by
about a dosen men at a time through-
out the twenty-four hours of the day.
Redhill supervises the operation of
the Victoria and London Bridge to
Brighton, Eastbourne and Portsmouth
main lines. In addition, i t controls
the coastal line from Hastings to
Portsmouth, the cross-country route
from Tonbridge through Redhill and
partway to Reading,and connected
branch lines.
Each controller has a specific
job. Some of them handle passenger
i ^ C O U N T RR Y
The past fortnight has been very
successful. The Club successively
defeated London Hospital, Westminster
College, and Marjons, and provided the
f i r s t man home in the Q.M.C. 7
-
J
r mile
race.
London Hospital was defeated on
Wed. 15th January. The Individual
winner was J. Collins with A. Brown
and G. T i l l y together third. The
Club easily beat Westminster on Sat.
18th with a triple t i e for first
position between J. Jaeger, K. Wall,
and A. Brown. The return match with
Marjons was held over the old univer-
sity course at Roehampton and a very
close struggle resulted in victory for
I.C. with J. Collins winning, A. Brown
3rd, and G. T i l l y 4th.
On Sat. January 25th, I.C. were
third in the important Q.M.C. 7^- mile
fixture, which was won by U.C. However
John Collins did magnificently to win,
defeating Jackson of Bristol and
Gilligan of U.C. in a time only 1 sec
more than J. Evans' 1956 time, i n
spite of the heavy conditions which
have made this course notorious.
The team was unlucky when J. Conway
and R. Landbeck went off course
whilst positioned 2nd and 3rd; never-
theless they did well to finish 5th and
6th respectively.
The second team, competing away
at Romford met strong opposition from
Woodford, Plessy, and Romford Athletic
Clubs. To cut a long story short, I.C.
4th.

trains in a particular area, others
freight trains. One man regulates
the locomotives and their crews.
Together they act as a team to ensure
that the working timetable i s adhered
to as far as possible. They must
ensure that every steam train has i t s
locomotive, carriages and crew, that
every electric train has a motorman
and a guard. The controllers are
also responsible for initiating fog
services and other emergency proce-
dure.
It is in time of emergency that
the control room i s needed most. We
saw this on our v i s i t . It was a day
of heavy snowstorms in Kent resulting
in the late running of trains from
Tonbridge, in particular the Margate
and Brighton to Birkenhead express.
The Margate portion was badly delayed
by snow-drifts and arrived at Redhill
more than three hours late. The
Brighton section was only slightly
behind time. As a result a freight
train had to be cancelled to provide
an engine far the latter part between
Redhill and Reading as i t was sent
ahead of the more badly delayed portion.
These hitches,together with more
minor ones resulting from frozen
points,among other causes,made the
v i s i t one of exceptional interest. On
a normal day, the average lateness of
passenger trains at their terminal
points i s less than half a minutes.
This i s in a district where the traf-
f i c i s very heavy a l l the year round.
One late train can delay many others
behind i t .
Another hold-up on this day was
caused by a bent conductor r a i l near
Arundel. This meant that only one
line could be used between two stations,
causing delays of up to half an hour
to the Victoria-Bognor service. Here
the control had to try to minimise the
delay as far as possible and to provide
extra stock and train-crews at Victoria
so that outgoing trains could leave
punctually.

Rumour has i t that the proposed

S.C.C. for a grant to purchase
