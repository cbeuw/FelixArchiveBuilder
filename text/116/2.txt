Cat*ahead, an inconspicuous Tyneeide
town waa wakened to l i f e on the morning
of Maroh 9th 1937, - a violent explos-
ion, otherwise known as George Martin,
took place. The tremors are s t i l l being
f e l t in such far-flung districts as
France, Switzerland and Kensington.
Gateshead Grammar School, a co-educ-
ational establishment, was the first
victim of this seismic oatastruphe. It
was here that George made hia mark In
â€¢port. He swam, played rugby for one
1st XV for 3 years, and, was reserve
for Durham Schoolboys. Towards the
end of this school career he was
thrown out of the girls' Prefects'
Boom seventeen times and finally left
school with a State Scholarship, a
eollsction of rugby songs and a sigh
of relief from the staff. Soon after,
and in the light of previous experience,
the aohool reverted to the segregation
of the sexes.
On coming to I.C. he played for the
'A' team, ?nde and lsts. He is now
captain of I.C. seconds and Guild's
f i r s t teams, playing prop, and took
part in the I.C. Bogby Club tour to
Frames last Christmas.
However, George's interests are not
limited to the rugby field. Ho has
been known to drink a pint standing
on his head, and is the resident
"Blaydon Races" singer of the College.
He enjoys "muekin' about in foreign
parts". He a s hitch-hiked through
Switierland and Italy, being arrested
by the oariblnieri on one oooasion.
His hostel room is adorned by 71 beer
mats, 6 sherry labels, a mirror kindly
donated by Messrs, Tollemaohe, a Keep
Left sign and a Belisha beacon ( a
present from the Metropolitan Police),
and a l i f e siie photograph of Miss
Brigltte Bardot.
His likes are a quiet pint of beer,
teddy bears and Ursula. His dislikes
include mild, teddy boys, women who
smoke and "Goons who try to Interview
yon". His plana for the future include
research and rugby. Wo wish him luck.

The loo Skating Club held a
meeting at the Arosa Rink, Richmondt
on January 17th. In retrospect,
over a pint in the local tavern, i t
was considered by those present,
some twenty members of the Club,
that i t had been one of the most
enjoyable and successful meetings
over held there.
Several vigorous sessions of
loo Hockey were interspersed with
general skating. Two teams of
ladies were formed by military per-
suasion and the resulting game,
though bloodless, would have put
St. Trinians to 3harae. The referee
was ignored and one of the goalies,
having let the puck through early
in the game prevented a recurrence
by removing the goal with the assis-
tance of a group of male supporters.
Altogether about 55 were present,
including skaters from some of the
women's Colleges; the next meeting
is i n March. The membership of the
olub i s increasing rapidly, apparently
as a result of the recent cold weather.
M O U R N I N G I N
There was great lamentation and
gnashing of teeth in R.C.S. on the
afternoon of Thursday January 16th.
The object of their sorrow was the
untimely exposure of their president
to the prying eyes of the public.
Responsible, of course, were the man
of C. and G., s t i l l enraged by the
removal of their pride and joy. But
let us recapitulate the sequence of
events leading to this startling
revelation.
Near 1 o'clock on the aforesaid
day Mr. Stevens invited Mr. Butters
to his room, so that they might attend
the C. and G. Union Meeting together,
the latter to oolleot a pair of his
trousers recently acquired by the
former. However, on entering the
R.C.S. president was bound and gagged
by a selection of the be3t C. and G.
brawn.
Hence, wrapped in a shroud, not
unlike a hostel curtain, and tied
with a large red ribbon, he was
transported into Guilds. With the
solemnity befitting the ooassion
he was borne Into the Union Meeting
and lay In state while the official
business began at 1.15 p.m.
The meeting was dominated by
talk of the Spanner and the advisability
of mounting i t ; another committee was
formed to consider the matter more fully.
Mr. Stevens gave details of the
loss of the Spanner. He had re-
ceived a somewhat Juvenile
letter last term that R.C.S. had the
Spanner, but was given no clue as to
its whereabouts, which are s t i l l unknown,
even to R.C.S. He found the whole
business "distasteful."
Indicating the shroud, Mr. Stevens
remarked: "We have here a great friend
of mine who kindly volunteered to attend
this meeting." He added that an u l t i -
matum had been isued to R.C.S. to the
effect that they had until 2.05 p.m. to
produce the Spanner in return for their
president. "Non-oompliance with this
w i l l lead to our Guest being released
in less than his usual attire in a
prominent locality."
There being no sign of the Spanner
at 2.05 p.m., the meeting was asked
for suggestions of places where Mr.
Butters might be unshrouded. Harroda,
Buckingham Palace, Downing Street were
among those suggested,but i t was felt
that the Albert Memorial would suffioe
due to i t s proximity.
T H E A F T E R N O O N
The Corpse was borne to Bo' and
the *moumi-ng"procession meandered to
the Memorial via R.C.S. causing complete
cessation of vehicular traffic. The
doors of R.C.S. were bolted and secured,
deathly white faces peered at the
multitudinous procession. As a
"Booraalaka" thundered to a caterwauling
crescendo, the very walls reverberated
with fear.
Triumphantly the procession moved
to the Albert Hall, whence the "Corpse"
was borne into the hallowed precincts
of the Albert Memorial. Here he waa
enshrouded, deprived of his dignity
and made to walk between two lines of
Guildsmen to the Albert Hall, where he
escaped into a taxi.
A band of expectant girls, held
in pregnant suspense by the spectacle
were unfortunately unable to catch
more than a fleeting glimpse of the
detrousered president.
A bouquet for Derek Butters for
being such a sport.
A raspberry far the Chelsea Polioe
who arrived too late to join in the
fun.
Quote of the day:
"We know R.C.S. are effem-
inate, but this is the first
time one has become a
