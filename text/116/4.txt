The control of the hydrogen-bomb
reaction i n Zeta, the zero-energy
thermonuclear appliance,is a tremen-
dous scientific accomplishment. It
•sill be recalled that a group in the
Physios Department here was working
on this project under Professor S i r
George Thomson until 1950, when i t
became too hot to handle, and then
removed to Aldermaston, where
Soeptre, a gadget similar to Zeta,
i s now In operation.
In contrast to the sputnik, this
achievement i s tremendously important
in that i t signposts the way directly
to a rise i n the standard of living
of millions of Asians and Africans
who now dwell i n mud huts and exist
on next to nothing. However, the
applications of technology to the
betterment of man are very muoh
neglected nowadays, and our own
society has fully demonstrated i t s
inability to cope with automation,
for example. The moral i s that
while scientists and technologists
may produce these marvellous things,
i t i s v i t a l that we concern ourselves
with their application as well. Other-
wise the benefits of Zeta may easily
be lost.
The third of the model study bedrooms
for the Prlnoo's Gardens Hostel is at
present under construction by the
architects, Richard Sheppard and
Partners, and w i l l probably be used
as the prototype for the Hostel. It
is due to be completed shortly. We
hope to have a complete description
in our next issue.

The I.C. Boat Club light olinker
eight, which was severely damaged on
Morphy Day by a Wandsworth Borough
Council lorry, i s now being repaired,
but w i l l be of no use as a racing eight
in future; the boat builders cannot
guarantee that the boat will be f i t for
use at a l l . The loss of the club's
be3t eight clinker at a time when our
expansion scheme i s in operation, is
a severe blow.
Wandsworth Borough Council has
been approached over the matter but
denies any l i a b i l i t y . At an Extra-
ordinary General Meeting the Club
Captain and Vioe-Captain were unani-
mously elected the plaintiffs for
the club, in the event of a court
oase. A writ has been issued on the
Cotaaoil.
Although the behaviour of the
Council employees i s not condoned
i t i s to be hoped that in future a
l i t t l e more sense may be uaed i n the
throwing of flour on such occasions.
Recent visitors to Touchstone
weekends may have noticed that i t has
become part of the Policy of the
General Studies Committee to invite
a small proportion of outsiders, from
neighbouring colleges, to take part
in our discussions.
This has proved very successful,
our visitors have shown themselves
very able and interesting people,
bringing with them new ideas and view-
pointS'Which are unlikely to be en-
countered in a purely scientific
gathering.
We are, without doubt, rather a
biassed College from the point of
view of education, yet our neighbours
with different backgrounds and
traditions might just as well come
from outer space, so l i t t l e do we see
of them.
I feel that this i s a sad reflec-
tion on our organization, and I hope
there are none among us who are so
narrow minded as to think i t an advan-
tage.
The Union and the College spend
considerable amounts of money on ways
and means of broadening our outlook,
but the ugly fact remains that I.C. i s
a specialist's paradise, with few
outside interests apart from sex and
beer.
One of the causes of this, the
9 to 5 student i s being tackled
energetically, by both Union and
College authorities by the provision
of New Hostels and Union facilities,
but another, our complete subservience
to the disciplines of science and i t s
applications, has not been touched.
That we should remain the Imperial
College of Science and Technology i s
an economic and administrative neces-
sity and therefore i s not feasible
for the College authorities to assist
our education here.
It i s true that Union fees might
prove a stumbling block, but one
would hope i t is hot beyond the i n -
genuity of Union Council, i f so direc-
ted, to formulate a change i n con-
stitution covering this.
Education has be. n said to consist
mainly of oontact between students -
the older provincial universities are
typical examples.
Our degrees may be on a par with
those of these institutions, but I
beg to suggest we are not educated.
Even when we reach the promised
land of a residential College, the
prospect of 2,000 half-fledged scien-
tists i n their cubby—holes can hardly
be said to be alluring.
It has been suggested that to
leaven this somewhat doughy mass some
hostel rooms be reserved for members
of, say, the Royal College of Art.
This seems an excellent idea but at
present of l i t t l e use, because our
Societies are closed shops, and
cliques would be inevitable. It is
time that the student body gave a lead
in this matter. Our neighbours would
provide a welcome shot in the arm for
most of our societies; no one genu-
inely interested would mind competi-
tion and the difference in viewpoint
would prove most stimulating. Per-
haps until such time as a new concept
of our Union can evolve we could
invite our neighbours as Guest Members
to our societies.
As I see i t , the only losers would
be our narrow minded friends disturbed
from their rut of self sufficiency.

FOREIGN COMPETITION
Dear Sir,
I cannot agree with your remark
in the issue of 17th January, in which
you state "This seems unfortunate since
many I.C. men were turned away later"
in referenoe to the entry of L.S.E.
and King's men to the first hop of term.
If I.C. men wish to attend the hops
they have ample opportunity to purchase
tickets i n the preceding week. Do you
suggest that "foreigners* should be
turned away In case some I.C. men
haven't made up their minds?
We are frequently urged in your
columns to mix more with non-scientists,
and quite rightly so. However, unless
men are prepared to go to the trouble
of seeking out fresh minds outside the
College - by attending U.L.U. functions,
or by joining a University Society - they
are left with the Saturday hop as the
only alternative. I would suggest that
men who attend only I.C. functions are
precisely those who need to meet out-
siders, and who stand to gain most from
the conflict.
By a l l means let's hare I.C. hops
for I.C. men, but don't discourage out-
siders just honanso some I.C. men are
too idle to think two days ahead.
Tours faithfully,
Ted Bates.
VITAL STATISTICS
Dear Sir,
According to a bank statement I
have recently received, I have had
transactions with the following:-
"City Guilds College"
... That typist can't type ...
"City College"
... must be the one "Felix"
employs . . .
and "In peril a College*
... 3he has a sense of humour
anyway.
She also has a very nice figure.
Yours etc.,
F. Peacock.
