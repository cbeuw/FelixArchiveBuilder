The let. XI continued in a winning
Tein when heating Epsom Gypsies 2 - 0
on Sunday Jan. 12th. From the moment
when Solway put I ,C. ahead with a
cracking shot from the edge of the
cirole they held the initiative
throughout and might well have won
by more than two goals.
The following day was a totally
different story. In the U.L. Cup
match ( Znd. round replay ) U.C. beat
I.C. 5 - 1 . Kewaon, an ex-U.L. hookey
captain, was on top form for U.C. and
opened the scoring with a hard shot
from the right Just inside the post,
when a l l the I.C. defence were expect-
ing him to centre. I.C. drew level
almost immediately from a goal by
Holmes after a goal-mouth scramble,
but before half-time U.C. scored two
more goals in quick succession. In
the second half U.C. rubbed in their
lead in no uncertain fashion, and
scored another two goals. One of
these was an amazing shot from Newson
reverse-stiok, on the run, into the
roof of the net. It should be said
that at no time did I.C. give up the
struggle. It Just wasn't our day and
we were beaten by a superior team.
Incidentally this is the f i r s t game in
which the 1st, XI has had more than
two goals scored against i t .
On Jan. 15th. I.C. entertained two
teams from Beading University. The
1st. XI lost 2 - 0 , in unfortunate
eiroumetanoes; the coach from the
Union being very late, I.C. started
without Jim Carter in goal, and both
Beading goals were scored before he
arrived. From then on, I.C. had far
more of the play, but Just could not
soore, although Holmes hit the post
with a good shot. The 2nd. team
beat Beading 2nd. 4 - 1 .
I.C. 1st. XI beat Old Creightonlans
4 - 1 at Harlington on Jan. ISth.
The result never seemed in doubt, even
though the team did not show quite the
form they had been showing earlier in
the season. It was particularly
pleasing to have the captain, Graham
King, back in the team, and on good
form, after his enforced lay-off; he
soored two goals. The 2nd. XI beat
Old Creightonlans 4 - 1 , and have
won a l l their three games this term.
The 3rd. XI, drew 3 - 3 against the
Club.

During the past two weeks the Club
has struck a bad patoh as far as the
results of the 1st. and 2nd. XI's are
oonoerned. The 1st. team has suffered
two successive defeats, to St. Mary's
College and Southampton University.
Some readers may be interested to
learn that good relationships with
Hook were well maintained at the
Dorohester Arms, on the way down to
Southampton. At Southampton, I ,C.
played much below standard and pro-
vided no answer to the home team' •
continuous attacks. I.C. were f i n -
ally defeated 7 - 0 .
The 2nd. XI, at Christmas well placed
in the League, have since lost two
important League games, but improved
at Southampton to hold the University
2nd. to a draw.
The several defeats mentioned should
have provided some lessons to the
players oonoerned, and i t is to be
hoped that I.C.'a- performance in the
coming matches will show the reoent
lapses to be only temporary.
The third team are s t i l l continuing
their successful run, and in spite of
dropping a point against Woolrlch,
s t i l l have a contending lead in their
division.
On Saturday 25th. Jan., the long un-
beaten run of the 4th. XI ended when
they were beaten by School of Pharmacy
by 3 - 2, after a close gene. Prior
to this match, the 4th. team had
scored 24 goals in three games.

I.C. Ploughing Steadily Towards the Cup
Westminster College -
I.C.
Westminster having wangled their
way out of playing the 2nd Round of
the U.L. Rubgy Football Cup when
unable to field their f u l l 1st XV,
due to injury, last term, i t was
left to I.C. to f i x the date of this
match. The 15th January was decided
upon. It was for this reason that
the match was played in conditions
where a postponement would normally
have been made for fog reduced v i s i -
b i l i t y to 15 yards at times, and the
pitch was waterlogged.
Having successfully appraised the
conditions, I.C. decided that i t would
be suicide to throw the ball around in
the backs and so left i t to the for-
wards to slog i t out, and i t was from
forward play that I.C.'s two scores
came. Right from the start the I.C.
pack hammered away at i t s Westminster
counterpart and successfully held
the game in the Westminster half,
only long touch-kicking on the part
of the opposing full-back bringing
the play into the I.C. half.whilst
the ball was reasonably dry, and
visibility allowed, the backs had
one or two runs, with Mil ward rnaking
one excellent break in the centre
before being pulled down. It was,
however, from a scrum infringement
near the Westminster posts that I.C.
were able to open the scoring, with
a good penalty from He am, who played
an excellent defensive game at fly-half.
The score remained 3 - 0 until half-
time.

Physical fitness is a great asset,
as a Cross Country Club member
has reoently discovered. He had to
out down his training because of a
bad cold, then on visiting the Doctor
he was told that he was recovering
from pneumonia. Obviously TOU eaa
benefit from keeping f i t .
In the seoond half the Westminster
pack decided to rough the game up a
bit, but found the I.C. pack more than
able to deal with their fistio efforts.
The I.C. front row, in the persons of
Evans, Gibbons and Wronksi, played a
tremendously powerful game, so much so
that their opposite numbers literally
cracked, and the I.C. pack as a whole
played so well together as to administer
a lesson in forward play to Westminster.
Our second try was scored by Lanz, then
from a difficult angle, and with the
posts invisible in the fog, He am only
just failed with the conversion, and
after a further period of forward battle
the final whistle went with I.C. the
winners by the convincing margin of
6 points to n i l .
I.C. meet C.E.M. in the semi-final
to be played away on February 12th.

The Annual Hyde Park Road Relay
w i l l take place on March 1st. at
3 pra. The Organiser, Kike Barber,
(Chem.P.G.) would be glad to hear
from anyone - especially Cross Country
or Athletio Club members - who is
willing to help with the work whioh
is involved.
This year the Relay promises to be
the largest yet; we are expecting
about 45 Universities and Colleges to
enter teams.
Last year we had a large "START &
FINISH" banner, which was erected at
the start of the Relay course. It is
now missing, but is presumably some-
where in the Union, so will anyone
who knows anything about i t please
contact Mike Barber.
