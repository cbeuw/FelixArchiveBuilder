BLOODY RUBBISH?
Dear Sir,
Phoenix has received an abundance
of vague censure of the "bloody rub-
bish" variety, and since the primary
object of any magazine i s to satisfy
those who buy i t we must admit that
there i s something wrong. However,
the only really constructive comments
were thoso in p. 4 of FELIX, and even
this rookfc. was ineffective through
lack of guidance. The fifteen hundred
agreed with every word as i f i t was
someone else's can. Let us be quite
olear as to where the blame l i e s or
we shall make no progress.
There seems to be a widespread
impression that the mag. has been
corrupted by a perverted editor or
editors selecting only the worst for
publication. In fact,'the activities
and interests of the college' have
been reflected only too well, and
they apparently do not include writing.
Without wishing to deny a hearing to
any aritio who i s not also a contribu-
tor, I would estimate that i f one per
cent of our connoisseurs of literature
would demonstrate their perfect taste
by producing a few items as good as
•Short History of Space", our troubles
would be over. If we want Phoenix to
rise again we must f i r s t identify the
ashes.
Yours sincerely,
Fred Wheeler.
LIGHTEN OUR DARKNESS
Dear Sir,
If The Phoenix should get the bird
then the students' magazines I have
Just road, The Isis of Oxford University
and Lucifer of Kings College London,
should get the brontosaurus 1
. Neither
had even a single page about the socie-
ties and sport of their readers; indeed,
The Isis, whioh i s a smaller magazine
than our own, had twice as many words
about Albert Camus than Ian H i l l wrote
for The Phoenix. Who, in Imperial
College, had heard about this writer
who had Just won the Nobel prize for
literature? Hardly anyone except Ian
H i l l who wrote a brilliant readable
biography of him.
No, no, no Mr. P.H.L., The Phoenix
is not another FELIX, i t la not another
Rector's Bulletin, i t i s a platform
where any students can express themselves
in any way. And i f Mr. P.H.L. oared to
read the last edition of The Phoenix,
and I sincerely doubt whether he has
read even a quarter of the words, he
would then see what a variety of
expression there was. Yes, here was
original thought reflecting the l i f e
and interests of a wide set of live
and interesting students. The Phoenix
had for onoe ceased to grovel at the
bottom of the Imperial College test
tube; i t had tried to breathe the
fresh a i r of the university outside.
The last issue was the Autumn
edition which i s inevitably short of
society and sports news as so l i t t l e
happens in the Summer term. Add to
this the extreme difficulties of
producing The- Phoenix last term be-
oause of the late indisposition of i t s
Editor and the lack of 00-operation from
sports writers, and you will realise
how i t came about that The Phoenix had
less of tiiis kind of material than I
had wanted. I am looking forward to
receiving contributions from a l l
those like Mr. P.E.L. who were disap-
pointed .
L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R SCRAP IT
I am glad to learn that there was
a spark of originality about Clotty.
For me i t was a great pleasure to have
encouraged a valiant band at writers
whose versatility and Originality was
a veritable beacon of light in our
darkness.
Yours sincerely,
Peter Jarman.
Mr. Jarman appears to be reading
into my review things that I just did
not say. However, I fully comprehend
his inability to understand 3imple
English, and will therefore try to
clarify matters.
First of a l l , in maintaining that
THE PHOENIX should reflect the acti-
vities and interests of the College,
and citing "Light Metallurgy" and the
Guineas advertisement as examples, I
was NOT proposing that i t should
contain accounts of social and sporting
events.
Secondly I emphasised originality.
THE PHOENIX should certainly be a
platform for originality but not for
Ian H i l l to stand up and recite quo-
tations in praise of Albert Camus.
(The profile in THE ISIS — twice the
length: ten quotations? — i s obviously
more suited to an University in which
the Faculty of Arts predominates. How
about a profile of Professor Blackett
or S i r Alexander Fleck for THE PHOENIX?)
Mr. Jarman makes the usual taunt
that those who criticise should contri-
bute. I would glady submit an editorial
saying exactly what his said and using
one f i f t h of his words to do so, did I
think that i t merited any words at a l l .
We have the clue to Jarman's
attitude in his letter. "Who, in
Imperial College, had heard about
this writer who had just won the
Nobel prize for literature? Hardly
anyone...." Here is Jarman in a
nutshell. Here i s Jarman's opinion
of his fellow men. HERE IS JARMAN
THE INTELLECTUAL SNOB, the i n s t i l l e r
of culture into the grovelling masses.
I would surmise that i t was the aura of
intellectual snobbishness enveloping
the last PHOENIX that has irritated so
many readers. A beacon of light in
our darkness? Hsj-dly a glow wonul

Dear Sir,
We wish to report that "City and
Guilds" was successfully disinfected
on the 20th January. It was also
noted that Guildamen were seen stag-
gering about with tears in their
eyes, probably weeping over a "Lost
Spanner."
It. CHE. MISTS.
Dear Sirs,
It seems reasoi, *Me to assume
that the Imperial Institute tower w i l l
have to remain in the new Imperial
College, so as to satisfy the Vic-
torian lovers of the Kensington Soc-
iety. I wish, there-fore, to pu%
forward the following suggestions for
making the eyesore as un-noticeable
as possible.
1. Dig a pit 280 f t . deep and sink
the folly completely, providing
hydraulic l i f t i n g gear for ceremon-
i a l occasions.
2. Build a high parapet wall round
the top of the highest building to
be built on the island site, and re-
erect the top part of the tower,
including the bells, for sentimental
and ceremonial occasions.
3. Dig a long trench and bury the
whole thing in a horizontal position;
then convert the inside into a r i f l e
range, so we can have shooting
practice on the persons who want i t
retained.
4. Sell the whole of Imperial
Institute to an American o i l king
for £250,000, and then we could
have a new income for cultural pur-
poses in the College.
Yours faithfully,
K. G. Reader.
HIGH FINANCE
Dear Sir,
In the last issue Nelson reports
that a cross-country runner suggests
running behind a taxi to save the
maximum fares. This joke i s , of
course, well known, and as old as
some of the taxis. It may interest
Nelson to know that a similar amusing
illogicality i s often put forward
seriously, as an attempt at conversa-
tion. As a non-smoker, I often meet
the remark:"How luckyI Think of the
money you s ivel"
However, Nelson and I know that
the amount is chicken-feed, compared
with what I save by not investing in
dud gold-mines, and by not keeping
two villas in the South of France.
Yours sincerely,
R.F. Streater.
WOT NO LIBRARY
Dear Sir,
In the October issue of the
"Rector's Bulletin," I read that
there is now a College General
Library. Apparently this has been
formed on the basis of the old Union
Library whioh no longer exists.
This change has, to my knowledge,
never baen announced to a Union Meeting,
although i t is a matter of considerable
importance to a l l concerned.
It may well be that the Union will
benefit by the change, but should i t not
have been discussed at a General Meeting,
instead of being presented as a fait
accompli?
Yours faithfully,
John K. Taylor.
