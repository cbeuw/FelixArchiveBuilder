Death and angry young men: not a good mix?
DramSoc’s two upcoming plays provide something that is sure to suit everyone’s dramatic disposition
The cast of Mort. They don’t look dead to me, although some of them look rather disturbing
Gasp! An ironing board! Or per-
haps not: the famous shock initial
audiences felt at John Osborne’s
play-within-the-prosaic will not be
felt today in an age used to ‘social
realism’ and Real Life Drama!
Yet the themes of disaffection, of
“lacking a crusade worth fighting
for” and of a messy, grudging love
are ones that still strike a chord, ar-
guably more so, with a generation
who live with the luxury of apathy.
Osborne infuses the main protag-
onist Jimmy, an archetypal exam-
ple of the Angry Young Men of the
1950s, with a searing personality of
frustrated power. As he cascades
through the play in a fury of an-
tagonism, he still yearns for a ‘hu-
man passion’ and ‘conviction’, while
maintaining sensitivity to love and
human companionship in an almost
childish dependence.
Jimmy’s long-suffering wife Ali-
son and his best friend Cliff suffer
his intellectual ranting and shock-
ing attempts at drawing reaction
in a loving relationship that seems
at once bizarre yet understandable.
Alison’s colonel father provides an
odd reflection of Jimmy – polar op-
posite in character yet similarly de-
prived of a concrete place, a role in
the world. It is only when Alison’s
friend Helena enters the scene, un-
fazed and grudgingly drawn to Jim-
my’s offensiveness, that he is chal-
lenged, though not yet contented.
Essentially it is Jimmy’s effect on
his surroundings that proves the
greatest draw to the audience. His
ripples of anger and their contact
with loved ones make up only the
immediate, visceral excitement of
the piece, making the overarching
themes all the more powerful in the
contrast with the domestic setting
they transcend. The play works
on us, the audience, by presenting
both the unrestrained voice of frus-
tration within us all and the figures
of sensibility we use to hide behind.
Ultimately it is us who prove most
shocking as, in those scenes of re-
vealed humanity, we start to sym-
pathise with this angry young man.
Some people ask: what is the hard-
est thing about being in a play?
Awkward rehearsal times? The
multitude of lines to memorise?
Stage fright? Well, the answer is
simple. It is getting us all out of the
I have a confession to make. Before
going to this production, I had never
seen Porgy and Bess. I hadn’t even
seen the 1959 movie with Sydney
Poitier. I do, however, own many of
the songs on CD as sung by Louis
Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, and
like everyone else I know, hearing
Summertime always brings a smile
to my face.
The new production at the Sa-
voy Theatre seems to be billed as
Gershwin for beginners. Rather
confusingly, Nunn has adapted it
from an opera to a musical, which
mostly seems to only have had the
effect of cutting its length and the
size of its accompanying orchestra.
As a lover of Gershwin and opera,
I approached the production with
trepidation; after all, why meddle
with perfection?
The first thing that struck me was
the quality of voice that had been
chosen. Though clearly not oper-
atic, the casting has been done so
carefully as to preserve the spirit of
Gershwinianoperaandthusjumped
the first hurdle of my prejudice.
In other ways the production has
clearly tried to be as faithful to the
original as possible. With the ex-
ception of a couple of minor roles,
all parts are played by black actors
(as Gershwin stipulated in his will),
and the set and costumes are true
to the backdrop of the work.
But I soon forgot about all these
things. I forgot to look for parts that
didn’t work, for dialogue that wasn’t
right, because this is a magical
production and I was completely
transfixed.
Every part, however small, was
performed exquisitely. During the
crowd scenes the cast moved as
one entity, flawlessly expressing
the community spirit which pro-
Even though I can’t imagine ador-
ing this as much as the full opera,
there is nothing I could criticise
about the performance. It is quite
simply the most moving perform-

whilst still not over-dignifying the

pub. When I say ‘all’, I am, in fact,
referring to a pretty diverse bunch.
Among others, there is a king, his
daughter, a couple of wizards, a
doorknocker, a cesspit cleaner and
a young boy emperor complete with
his murderous evil vizier. Oh, and
of course, there is Death. Two of
them in fact. I am obviously refer-
ring to the Drama Society’s latest,
and one of its largest, productions:
Mort. Based on the novel by Terry
Pratchett and adapted by Stephen
Briggs, this uproariously funny play
tells the story of young Mort, who
starts his first job as an apprentice.
To Death.
Of course, Death has more in
mind for Mort than just teaching
him the business. You see, Death
has an (adopted) daughter. Mort’s
eye, however, is caught by the beau-
tiful Princess Keli, who is unfortu-
nately about to die.
How will it all turn out? You’ll
just have to come and find out for
yourself!
