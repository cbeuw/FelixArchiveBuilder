Islam outrage, new clubs, and NUS
It seems you’re an angry little lot when you’re all riled up about something; here are your spleens, vented
In response to
Samuel Lynas’
article about
Islam
Dear Andy,
It was quite depressing to read the
article “Islam, Violence and the
Empires” (Felix 1364), which terri-
bly misrepresents the ICU Islamic
Society. I’m sure you would have
received e-mails about this, but I
would just like to make it known that
Samuel Lynas did not approach the
Islamic Society at all when writing
his article.
As we were not even given the
opportunity of answering his ques-
tions it would seem that Mr Lynas
set out to write an unbalanced arti-
cle from the start.
This may be standard practice
for certain types of newspaper, but
I would like to think that the stu-
dent newspaper of one of the best
universities in the world could do
slightly better. Indeed, there are
plenty of opportunities on campus
to talk to your average Muslim and
find out what we believe, and what
our views and opinions are on cur-
rent affairs as well as history. The
Islamic Society and all its events
are open to everyone.
We have our Friday prayer and
sermon in the Union Building at
lunchtime. Our prayer room is at
the basement of 9 Prince’s Gar-
dens. Just before the prayer room
we have a ‘doss room’ where we sit,
chill and discuss things.
If Samuel Lynas really wants to
“ask questions”, perhaps he should
actually talk to the Islamic Society,
or even e-mail us, and ask those
questions. That would enable him to
write a balanced article. To write an
article insinuating that the Islamic
Society is extremist seems a very
Dear Andy,
I have read the article on the Islam-
ic website. I read it for what it was:
a piece of historical information
concerning the life of a competent
leader and general.
I would like to thank Samuel
Lynas for making me go to the
website and read the article under
contention. While I was doing so, I
read a few other articles on Islamic
history and was amazed to find a
totally alien aspect to Islam and its
development throughout history.
It made me realize how far it is
from being the “psychotic death-
cult” that the modern media has
convinced people like Mr Lynas to
believe.
Thank you, Islamic Society, for
putting such articles of history on
your website. They may be biased
but that’s better than having hun-
dreds of clubs and societies with no
place to find such historical infor-
mation coming from a voice within
Imperial College students.
While you’re at it, Mr Lynas, next
time you go to Trafalgar Square to
visit all the statues of British gener-
als, please write an article on how
some people (like you) can be fool-
ish enough to think that the statues
are a celebration of violence and
mass slaughter.

Guildsheet, the
NUS campaigns
and fools
Dear Andy,
In the article titled “NUS farce con-
tinues” (Felix 1364), it is stated that
the Returning Officer for the NUS
Referendum, Jon Matthews, was
“approached by the ‘Yes’ campaign
with concerns over conspiracy in
the ranks of the ‘No’ campaign”. It
is mentioned that the leader of the
‘No’ campaign is the President of
the same faculty union that pub-
lished the offending paper, pre-
sumably implying that the CGCU
President could have influenced
Guildsheet editor’s behaviour. Is
this the same ‘Yes’ campaign who
can name amongst their ranks a
person who was not only, as your
newspaper reminds us, Guildsheet
editor, but also a former CGCU
President and Chairman himself?
In fact, it almost seems to me that
the only position that this former
CGCU barbershop quartet singer
has never achieved within said un-
ion is that of Welfare Officer, having
been defeated way back when.
It must be pretty galling for the
pro-NUS group not to have thought
of advertising in Guildsheet despite
having such an illustrious veteran
of CGCU and Union politics. It all
just sounds like sour grapes from
the joiN-US group.

PS In case it’s assumed this is an
attack on the ‘Yes’ campaign by a
fervent ‘No’ man, I’d hasten to add
that it must be equally degrading
for a political movement to resort
to naming themselves after the
opening at the lower end of the ali-
mentary canal in a vain attempt to
disturb the student body out of their
political apathy and vote.
Why is the
library incredibly
hot in winter?
Dear Andy,
Can you please explain to me why,
whilst sitting at a computer on the
second floor of the Central Library
in a t-shirt on a cold winter’s day,
I am dripping with sweat? It’s not
because of an essay deadline, I can
assure you! Am I really the only
person at Imperial who finds the
temperature of the Library faintly
ridiculous?
It’s certainly not conducive to
work! As a leading scientific insti-
tution shouldn’t we be setting an
example by saving energy? Is there
no environmental policy that we
should be abiding by? More perti-
nently, can’t we design buildings
with windows?
Why is it so f**king hot? I’d carry
on with the rage but this heat is
sending me to sleep; a potential
reason for the apathy around cam-
pus, perhaps?
Yours, clammy and ‘orrible,
Darryl Croft
Andy Sykes replies,
The library has been a roasting
oven for a number of years; as
long as I can remember, anyway.
A quick straw poll of the Felix of-
fice seems to suggest that Level 5
of the library is so hot because a)
the College is conducting secret
experiments on xenomorphs and
requires tropical conditions to en-
sure the creatures’ wellbeing, b)
that there’s a gateway to hell in the
far cubicle of the gent’s toilets, and
despite the librarians’ best efforts
to counter the ancient evil, it still
heats the surrounding air to sev-
eral hundred degrees, or c) the li-
brary is built on an Indian… sorry,
Native American burial ground.
strange way of asking questions,
especially considering the fact that
the Islamic Society is within such
easy reach.
Lynas says, “I admit that it is un-
settling to ask these questions.” No,
Samuel, we’re used to them. “But it
is suicidal not to ask them.” So why
didn’t he ask us?
Yours faithfully,
Mohammed Marikar
ICU Islamic Society
Millions of pilgrims descend on Mecca; every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to travel to Mecca once
Samuel Lynas replies,
Mr. Afridi’s guess about the prov-
enance of my low opinion of Islam
is sadly mistaken. Does he really
believe that the only reason Islam
generates more antipathy and
fear than Buddhism is some unex-
plained media bias? Would that it
were!
As for Mr. Marikar’s puzzlement
that I failed to pose these questions
directly to the Islamic Society, I
must inform him that they were
not addressed to the Islamic Soci-
ety. Rather, they were addressed to
those non-Muslims who are start-
ing to wake up to the danger that
Islam represents to this country
but have, as yet, an unclear grasp
of the magnitude of the problem.
I flattered myself that the Mus-
lim response to my article was
something I could predict, and Mr
Raja’s article in last week’s Felix
did nothing to disabuse me of this
notion. It is a perfect example of
Muslim apologism, and makes my
point for me quite succinctly. Per-
haps next week Mr. Raja could ex-
plain away the millenia of slaugh-
ter, enslavement, rape, pillage, and
genocide committed by Muslims in
the Indian sub-continent, Africa,
Spain, the Balkans, the Middle
East, Turkey, Central Asia, and the
Mediterranean Basin. The more
people like him write, the less peo-
ple like me need to.
In closing, let me say how en-
couraging it is that the stigma
previously attached to criticism
of Islam, the religion of peace, tol-
erance, and fluffy animals, has
disappeared so completely. As
the Muslim population of the UK
grows, it will become bolder still in
its insistence that we must adopt
the dictates of a mentally ill 7th-
century Arabian merchant. Point-
ed criticisms of this totalitarian
political system masquerading as
a religion are more necessary than
ever. Long may they continue.
Any excuse to print this picture again; the impounding of Guildsheet
