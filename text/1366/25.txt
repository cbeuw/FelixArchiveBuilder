Sex, lies and radioactive sushi
Wait, hold up, hold on just a second.
The Russian government and the
KGB, being the geniuses they are,
passed a law about a month ago
that allows the KGB (oh come on,
they can call it what they want, it’s
always going to be the KGB) to kill
people in foreign countries, as if
the rest of the world have to auto-
matically usher people out of their
assassin’s way so they can do their
job. Pretty conveniently, a couple of
weeks later, some Russian former-
spy who defected to England of all
places (I could have given you a list
of healthier options, mate!) starts
losing his hair and subsequently
dies of radiation poisoning. Coinci-
dence? Must be…
Now, normally I’m the first to
jump up and down and scream at
people about the dangers of eating
sushi at Itsu, especially the branch
in Piccadilly - who coincidently hap-
pen to be proudly sponsored by IC
Catering - quite clearly the Rus-
sians have yet to spy on the general
student consensus of where to eat
in London, and as can obviously be
seen, and it’s their loss, frankly. If
you absolutely have to eat at Itsu,
ever, though, my advice is to avoid
the tuna, they tend to leave it out for
a few weeks before it gets plonked
on a bit of rice – don’t say you
haven’t been warned.
Let’s think about it logically,
though. The KGB has been going
about its business of destroying life
wherever it sees fit for yonks now,
and it was not really any big sur-
prise to see this dude dead, to be
honest - journo, big critic of presi-
dent, shot dead. Ex-spy, investigat-
ing her murder? Surely somebody
somewhere saw it coming.
No, here’s what I would have
done. I would have taken two rook-
ie agents who had no fucking clue
what they were doing, dressed
them up in hoodies and given them
readily available (on the black mar-
ket, or frankly in Camden market)
pistols, and sent them barging into
the restaurant to drill three into the
poor guy’s chest. Not only would the
powers that be not have the faintest
idea it was KGB, but such an ingen-
ious idea would completely throw
them off the trail by making them
start their manhunt in Brixton.
People are getting into a big fuss
overtheentirespectacle,evenmore
so than when Bliar sent fourteen
troops to Iraq to play crash-dummy
into each other in spanking new
helicopters solely for the amuse-
ment of Curious George (and also

Maximum of 13 + 1 points
The Sarge is a big fan of Bond
because that new guy would
be welcome in his bunk bed
any day of the week. Name the
actor playing Bond and (except
questions 5 and 6) the name of
the film the snapshot is from.

The Sarge is very eagerly looking forward to the new cold war, where sushi is a weapon of mass destruction

Bond gets frisky with an old friend - which
film is this from and who’s playing Bond?
Sarge believes this is possibly the most camp
Bond ever. Who is he and what film is it?
RAWR! If you don’t know who this is, don’t
consider a career in the army.
Sexy bird with a pistol. Bond had better shoot
or he’ll get the daylights scared out of him...
No movie required here, so only one normal
point (nudge wink). Who’s this shexy man?
No movie required here either, but who is
this man and what is his significance to 007?
Oooh, a bonus question, goody goody. You’ve got two points for this one. Who was the first Bond to record the famous ‘Gun Barrel’ scene,
and in which film was it first shown?

A photo taken from a top-secret KGB handbook, showing two agents
with evil grins eating sushi off the back of their latest dead victim
because not enough of them were
croaking to make it a worthwhile ef-
fort, frankly). Who cares?
Anyway, this week’s Coffee Break
stars the new, gadgetless, extreme-
ly metrosexual James Bond. Gone
are the days when he would leave
a woman gasping for breath in bed
before getting her to lick his dick
clean and proceeding to rip the
heads off fifty bad guys with his
bare hands before firng a bazooka
up the arse of the big bad guy. No,
the only naked we got to see was
him in short shorts. Sarge gives Ca-
sino Royale two thumbs up...
