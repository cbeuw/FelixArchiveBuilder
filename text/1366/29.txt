The day began well with a member
of the men’s hockey team, who will
remain anonymous, chasing after
the coach as it set off to Harlington,
displaying impressive dedication.
(No, this was not due to the mag-
netic allure of the Ladies hockey
team; the men were also playing at
home.)
Upon arriving in Harlington, the
IC girls, defied the elements; pro-
ceeding to warm up in a torrential
downpour. Having beaten the op-
position, St Barts 3rds, 12-0 in our
previous encounter IC were in a
confident mood. So confident that
Bella decided we didn’t really need
our (fabulous new) keeper, Trish,
and promptly belted a ball into one
of the few parts of her body not pro-
tected by padding.
St Barts, adopted a clever ploy of
arriving late in the vain hope that
we’d be so tired and wet by the
time the game commenced; giv-
ing themselves an outside chance.
They overdid the tardiness and ar-
rived over 30 minutes late giving
IC the opportunity to be granted a
walkover. IC’s generous captain, Fi,
allowed them the dignity of getting
their butts kicked in a fair match.
The game commenced with a
very intimidated opposition trying
desperately to work out how many
they had on the pitch and why they
were surrounded by a threaten-
ing sea of blue and red shirts (we
had lots of subs and some fabulous
cheerleaders a.k.a the mens 3rd
and 4th teams). IC were lacklus-
tre compared to usual; with a lack
of passing and communication be-
tween defence and attack.
As the first half progressed IC
picked their form up and produced

some awesome opportunities; Mala
closely missing a wonderful shot
from the post and Dasha missing a
beautiful backhand flick. In a match
where IC were too lazy to pull back
and defend, the defence did well to
keep a vicious resistance and the
ball in the attacking half for most of
the half.
As the teams formed their half
time huddles IC had only 1 goal
under their belts. The half time
talk suggested IC would have to in-
crease their energy, if captain, Fi,
were to be kept happy; “We need
more players in their ‘D’”. “We
need to get back and defend more
quickly”, “Stick to your marker like
glue”, “We need more movement;
look for spaces”.
IC emerged for the second half
enraged by the low score and ready
for a slice of goal pie. The defence,
again, repelling all of St Bart’s
movements towards IC’s goal, with
Bella taking some incredible hit
outs, one of which found its way
onto one of the opposition’s knees;
a swift request for ICE followed.
Mala worked hard in midfield, pro-
viding a much-needed link between
attack and defence, even managing
to hold posotion whilst falling into
a ‘splits’ position! Trish, in goal,
intimidated St Bart’s attackers be-
fore they even passed the half way
line- it wasn’t until the last couple
of minutes that she even touched
the ball! Fi, as sweeper, cleared
every threatening or wayward ball;
allowing IC another opportunity to
attack. The 2nd half was far more
rewarding for IC with 2 graceful
goals from the posts from Mala
and Melissa. St Bart’s began to
play rather viciously in desperation
which led to several minor injuries.
Amanda scored a 4th with a clever
manoeuvre which confused the
goalie. The match ended with cel-
ebratory brownies in the changing
rooms courtesy of Mala which lifted
IC spirits which were otherwise
disheartened by the lack goals.

Anyone passing the river at Putney
last Saturday may have seen more
activity than usual. The 27th, head
of the river, fours race was taking
place, with over 500 crews and 2000
rowers competing. Sponsored and
run by Fuller’s, the prize for win-
ning your category is a literal piss
up at the Fuller’s stag brewery;
there was a lot more at stake than
just pride.
Imperial entered 7 crews, in vari-
ouscategories. Thefirstboat;Adam
Freeman-Pask, Will Laughton, Mar-
tin Rogulja and George Whittaker,
entered in senior 2 quads, won by a
clear 6 seconds. They beat over 60
boats including an Oxford Brookes
boat containing an Olympian and
3 U23 GB International athletes.
This result was a good send off for
George, who is going to Thailand for
3 months in the interest of ‘work’.
The second boat entered in the
senior 1 coxless fours didn’t fare
so well; the wrong side of a 6 sec-
ond deficit. A disappointing row
combined with injuries placed Ole
Tietz, Jonty McNuff, Simon Hislop
and Ben Smith in third.
ICs third boat; Scott Rennie, Dan
Cadoux-Hudson, Rob Manton and
Mark Mearing-Smith, finished 9th
in senior 2 coxed fours. A respect-
able result for a line up with a swap
of sides for Rob and a change of role
for Rhino Rennie. IC IV, entered in
senior 2 coxless fours was not al-
lowed to race competitively having
substituted out every individual
from the original entered crew- a
fairly harsh ruling.
The women’s top boat was Helen
Ellison, Carlyn Greenhalgh, Kay
Jacks and Cynthia Mynhardt also
coming 9th in senior 2 quads, a rea-
sonable result for a tough event.
The women’s squad also secured
4th and 14th place in senior 3 coxed
fours.
The crews decided on a quiet
drink in the local pub. This soon
went out of the window and the
squad descended, en masse, to
the London Rowing Club ‘Jungle
themed’ party. Being greeted by
fake tan smothered men wearing
thongs is always a good start to a
night. Responsible drinking was ob-
served during the unimaginatively
named Strongbow and Bottle of
Rum challenge. Imperial are very
thankful to London for their ‘pour
your own drink’ policy at the bar.
The only casualty of the night being
Olly Moore, who was outfoxed by a
loose floorboard, suffering the big-
gest swollen ankle I’ve ever seen.
