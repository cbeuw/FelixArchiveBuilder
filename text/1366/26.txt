Greetings, crossword fans!
This week’s crossword has
something of a mathematical
theme. Well, more of a hint really
rather than a theme - I got bored
and forgot to keep putting maths
terms in.
Apparently I’ve been criticised
for having too many anagrams in
my crosswords. In response to
this, I’ve added even more for your
further enjoyment. However, with
any luck they’re slightly more well
hidden than normal. Well, probably
not, but that was the intention.
Anyway, it’s probably best if you
stop reading this twaddle and do
the crossword! Enjoy!

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
Waves. That’s what
that is a picture of. Or
is it streaky bacon?
I can’t quite decide
now I think about it.
Perhaps it’s in fact a
pair of twiglets. Nik Naks anyone?
Worms racing head to head in
some “fashionable” Guiness Extra
Cold advert. You decide.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Unfortunately, your
dentist informs you
he is relocating to
Buenos Aires, Mexico.
You have no choice
but to fly out to get
your pegs cleaned. Upon leaving
the plane, a collection of gringos
point and laugh. Buenos Aires is in
Brazil – Mongoloid.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
This week you meet
Hugh The Man Stuck
In A Muddy Field. You
tell him you appreciat-
ed his crossword help
last week, especially
since the the Xword Cru got one
over on the SudoKru. Someone
knees you in the bojangles – I
mean, who the hell talks like that?
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
“Something kinda
‘Ooooooo’, jumping on
my ‘toooot toot’. The
ramblings of a can-
nibalistic Felix writer,
Matthew Ho-Bag
as he teddybear rolls around the
blue and navy speckled office floor
celebrating life, God, table fussball
and Turkish delight.
This Week’s Oscilloscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
You hear someone
knocking at door at
7:28 pm. You go to
open it and there he
is, dripping wet, shirt
half-open and foppish
hair framing his gorgeous visage.
Yes, you’ve been expecting him for
so long. It’s your dad! You need to
see a therapist you sex-mad freak.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
This week you will
convince yourself that
all your friends are
called Juan-Fernando.
In reaction to their
bemusement of your
new found label for them, you chop
off both your arms. You can no
longer hug the world and all of its
little children. You suck. Eggs.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
You star sign looks like
a pair of tightly com-
pressed butt cheeks.
Upon realising this,
you loosen your sup-
posed buttocks. Little
do you know that a small homosex-
ual goblin-like creature called Toby
has been waiting his whole life for
this moment. You feel pain.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Anton J, I can see you,
you dirty, dirty man.
You enjoy fellating
farm animals and
have been known to
pick pickled peppers
with your penis, you pervert. The
Horoscope Team will hunt you
down and make you taste their
“angry sticks”. LOL COCKS!!!11
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
This week you discov-
er the joys of granary
bread. The grains feel
like an angel from
heaven tickling your
tongue. You deck out
your new Kensington spread with a
granary loaf bed. It’s so soft! Mould
begins to grow and your skin turns
a fluffy dull green texture.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
There’s a fly in the
dungeon, dear Andy,
dear Andy. Well swat
it dear Tomo, dear
Tomo. With what shall
I swat it dear Andy,
dear Andy? A copy of Felix dear
Tomo, dear Tomo. Sacrilege. If I
catch ANY of you fuckers mistreat-
ing this newspaper, you’re dead.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
The Bearded Intruder
is absent this week,
after his beard and
his very lineage were
insulted by some cock
with an attitude prob-
lem and, more offensively, stupid
hair. In response, he has taken the
only mature approach available
and stormed off in a hissy fit.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Hi, my name is Mike
Cook. My favourite
past times include
peeling potatoes,
trimming my navel
hair and scraping
finger poo from keyboards. I have
a plethora of talents, especially
rimming. Call me now for fun times
and I fix you up good. Ciao ciao.
