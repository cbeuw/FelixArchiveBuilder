Iraq’s diplomatic disaster
Since the recent American mid-
term elections, the debate on Iraq’s
future has been attracting progres-
sively more attention. Every op-
tion for the future of foreign troops
in the war torn country has been
considered. From immediate with-
drawal, to “phased redeployment”,
be it phased withdrawal or increase
of troops, as well as approaches to
regional diplomatic initiatives to
secure the non-interference of re-
gional powers, is being touted as
the wise and prescient course.
Last week, Iran’s supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during
talks with the Iraqi president that
UStroopsmustleaveIraqifsecurity
is to be restored. In an efffort to re-
establish local diplomatic ties, Iraqi
President Jalal Talabani, visited
the neighbouring power as the first
Iraqi head of state to visit Tehran
in almost four decades. This came
after a recent summit meeting be-
tween Iraqi President Jalal Talaba-
ni and Syrian President Bashar Al
Assad. In an ironic twist of events,
it seems that the US is consider-
ing to pursue regional security in
exchange for co-operation from the
previous main “axis of evil” powers.
This may involve ceasing the threat
of UN sanctions due to objections
to Uranium refinement for Iran, as
well as losing some heat from the
investigation behind the murder of
former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
of Lebanon, as well as allegations
off funding terror.
In his recent visit to Pakistan,
the Prime Minister Tony Blair was
dogged by continuing criticism of
British policy in Iraq. His admis-
sion that the violence since the fall
of Saddam Hussein was “a disas-
ter” confirms what many have been
arguing for nearly two years.
The claim was made in an inter-
view with the Arabic television sta-
tion Al-Jazeera in a programme
hosted by Sir David Frost where
he questioned Tony Blair about
the West’s intervention in Iraq had
“so far been pretty much of a dis-
aster”. The Prime Minister replied:
“It has, but you see, what I say to
people is why is it difficult in Iraq?...
It’s not difficult because of some
accident in planning, it’s difficult
because there’s a deliberate strat-
egy - al-Qaeda with Sunni insur-
gents on one hand, Iranian-backed
elements with Shia militias on the
other - to create a situation in which
the will of the majority for peace is
Trident update
What is the big deal about Trident?
As the United Kingdoms sole nu-
clear deterrent, we have a right to
maintain it; to keep it running and
ready to strike. Security is at the
top of Britain’s agenda; supporting
America in a war crumbling at its
foundations and seeping into the
glue that binds together Labour
has attracted the worlds ‘terror-
ists’, with Bush and Blair the pro-
tagonists. And that doesn’t look like
its going to stop. Blair has already
initiated plans for a successor, al-
though information is sparse.
In all, the British trident com-
prises four vanguard class sub-
marines, each carrying approxi-
mately 48 trident missiles, topped
off with nuclear warheads. These
cold war relics occupy the oceans
in undisclosed locations; a symbol
of the United Kingdom lurking in
the corner of any protagonist’s eye.
Official numbers remain confiden-
tial, but conservative estimates
put Britain’s nuclear arsenal at
around 200 missiles. Compare that
to the US arsenal of approximately
5000 warheads. But then again, the
Americans are there to defend the
world against derivations of Marx’s
ideology; protecting freedom and
liberating nations. They need effec-
tive weapons and deterrents.
This is from a country that has
signed the Nuclear Non-Prolifera-
tion Treaty. America is taking steps
displaced by the will of the minority
for war.”
Opposition MPs, and relatives
of British soldiers killed since the
2003 invasion, seized on the com-
ment as evidence that the Prime
Minister had finally accepted that
his strategy in the Middle Eastern
state had failed. Such comments fly
in the face of the many statements
and remarks, which have been ex-
pressed, by both Downing Street
and the Whitehouse that democra-
cy is working and Iraq will soon be
in place to take over its security.
But a Downing Street spokes-
woman insisted Mr Blair did not be-
lieve the violence in Iraq had been
a disaster. “He was simply acknowl-
edging the question in a polite way
before going on to explain his view,”
she said. “To portray it as some
kind of admission is completely
disingenuous.”
Liberal Democrat leader Sir
Menzies Campbell said the Prime
Minister should now apologise for
his actions. He added: “At long last
the enormity of the decision to take
military action against Iraq is be-
ing accepted by the Prime Minis-
ter. It could hardly be otherwise as
the failure of strategy becomes so
clear.”
Rose Gentle, 42, from Glasgow,
whose 19-year-old soldier son Gor-
don was killed by a roadside bomb
while on patrol in Basra in 2004,
echoed these criticisms. The moth-
er-of-three, a member of Military
Families Against the Iraq War, said:
“He’s made a fool of himself and he
may have admitted the war was a
disaster, but he is still too arrogant
to take any blame. This war should
never have happened anyway.”
Across the Atlantic the recent
seizure of power by the democrats
of both chambers in the mid-term
elections is widely seen as a refer-
endum on Bush’s policy of Iraq. In
a post-election news conference,
George Bush accepted that the vot-
ers “registered their displeasure”
at the way Iraq had gone wrong.
The President mentioned the Iraq
Study Group, under his father’s
Secretary of State James Baker,
several times. He is to meet it soon
and perhaps was hinting that he
will take the Group’s recommen-
dations seriously. Prior to the elec-
tion defeat the neo-con policy of full
spectrum domination hollowed out
the sound of alternatives, however,
the realists have gained promi-
nence with the mid-term victory
and a new set of policies well may
be on the horizon.
I opened up BBC News today with
some interest to discover that
– praise be! – the Creationism lob-
by are starting a fresh attack on
this nation’s education. A group
going along the name of “Truth in
Science” have been sending out
teaching packs including a manual
and two DVD’s (although I bet that
they’re nowhere near as good as
‘Casino Royale’) to all secondary
schools in the country, which con-
tain material promoting intelligent
design as an alternative theory to
evolution. Worryingly enough, 59
schools have written back saying
that they will teach the material in
class.
If you have a gander at their web-
site (www.truthinscience.org.uk)
anyone with any awareness can
sense that something fishy is going
on. We are told first that Truth in
Science aims to “promote good sci-
ence education in the UK”, with “in-
itial focus…on the origin of life and
its diversity”; despite this rationale
this phrasing nestles alongside a
quote calling Darwinism “nihilis-
tic’. (Isn’t this choice of words ironic
considering Darwinism concerns
the study of life? Just me then.)
Moving on to the board of gover-
nors, great lengths are undertaken
to show off the academic back-
ground of the governor board; how-
ever this board is also host to Willis
B. Metcalfe (“A businessman with
a long career in agriculture and
publishing evangelical Christian
literature in several languages”),
Maurice Roberts (“Minister of the
Inverness congregation of the Free
Church of Scotland”) and Gerard A.
Chrispin (“directs Daylight Chris-
tian Prison Trust”). I’ll leave you to
make your own punch-line here.
But it is scientific, really! The
website also contains “Evidence for
Evolution” (Nurse! The screens!),
analysing such famous cases as
“Darwin’s Finches”, which offered
the following conclusion: “They
are a good example of micro-evo-
lution…This study does not give
evidence for macro-evolution” and
how animals came about from “sim-
ple single-celled ancestors”. (Read:
“We are not monkeys!”) Notice
however they do not link to Dar-
win’s ideas on how complex organs,
such as eyes, evolved via small
mutations from simple skin-based
receptors barely able to distinguish
colours to the massive machine we
use to see with today. (Isn’t that’s
why it’s called evolution?)
How could the situation have got
so dire? Surely major politicians
Attack of the creationists
to halve its arsenal, but 2500 war-
heads overshadows that of North
Korea’s and China’s, countries that
pose threats to America and Amer-
ican allies. The American nuclear
weapons are a negotiation tool that
cannot be neglected, arguably used
to suppress the nuclear ambitions
of countries like Iran.
Why have nuclear weapons in the
first place? For a developing coun-
try, they represent a stab at rising
to the global stage political stage, a
chance to prove brilliant scientists,
and an effective internal propagan-
da tool. The irony is that, in Britain,
the nuclear weapons program is
one that is looked on with disdain.
So do we actually really need
Trident? As a symbol that is turn-
ing from one of power into one of
tyranny amid fears of a global ‘nu-
clear meltdown’, maybe it is time
to reassess our nuclear arsenal.
Do we need a replacement nuclear
deterrent once trident, a historical
relic, has lived its life? Or is it time
we grew out of nuclear weaponry
altogether?
I
am somewhat concerned
this week why politics has
descended into nothing but
nukes, religion and war! How
interesting it is that after
the years of bloodshed in Iraq, the
Bush administration is being diplo-
matically forced into being helped
by powers it would rather not deal
with. To what extent are leaders of
different nations to trust each oth-
er? In the case of Iraq it seems that
if it is left on its own, it will either
tear itself apart from the inside or
be torn from an external source.
It would be worth the political
ease for the US to give Iran some
slack and allow monitored urani-
um processing. No power is more
responsible than the next when
it comes to the power of total glo-
bal destruction. However, many
still view Iran as an untrustworthy
power, whose views may be neo-
expansionist in the immediate re-
gion that it can affect. Also, it is not
known how destabilised the region
will be if any regional power starts
to abuse its obligations.
My hunch is that Iran and Syria
could do a damn good job of stop-
ping the immediate blood shed as
well as maintaining some regional
stability. Political tricks, betray-
als and assassinations aside, it is
(unfortunately) better to have all
the bickering tyrannical powers in-
volved rather than just one.
Chen Jimeng
would have stood up to this sort of
baseless meddling? Erm, not quite.
Boris Johnson (he of floppy-haired
fame) in responding to a creation-
ist video sent to him called the de-
bate ‘quite right’ and derided the
“wider agenda, which seeks to re-
place the Judeo-Christian beliefs
that underpin society with secular-
ism” and is, apparently, a product
of “political correctness”. Indeed,
Darwin himself was famous for
reading the Independent and eat-
ing Muesli for breakfast. Even our
dear leader, Tony Blair, has no beef
with the teaching of creationism; in
an interview he praised a ‘diverse
school system’, which will “deliver
better results for our children”.
My faith (oh, the pun) in the
system is still present mind; as I
was wrapping this piece up news
emerged that Richard Dawkins,
every Imperial student’s pin-up, is
to launch a counter-think tank to
“Prevent pseudo-science taking
over in schools” and to subsidise
buying of scientific material to be
used in schools. Hallelujah!
