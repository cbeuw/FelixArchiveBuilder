On the 10th of November, 2006
ICSM saw its first charity talent
show held in aid of Médecins Sans
Frontières. The event at the Rey-
nolds bar at Charing Cross Hospital
included a broad and colourful vari-
ety of acts ranging from the 6 piece
band, Dirtbag and the Empire, to
the dancers of The Ok Go! Team, to
the hip-shaking Shakira-esque bel-
lydancer, Canan.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)
is an independent humanitarian
medical aid agency committed to
two objectives: providing medical
aid wherever needed, regardless
of race, religion, politics or sex and
raising awareness of the plight of
the people they help www.msf.org.
Understandably opportunities for
involvement in MSF’s international
projects require that doctors have
completed at least two years at
SHO level, therefore eager medical
students wanting to get involved
have to wait patiently to apply. In
Riding Club has recently become
Riding and Polo Club, and to cel-
ebrate we had a weekend of polo
related activities – panto-polo on
Saturday and a couple of polo taster
sessions on Sunday.
Saturday started out pretty wet,
and I think this put some people
off, but there were still enough very
keen (or slightly mad) participants
for us to make our way over to Hyde
Park and play some foot-polo. This
was great fun, much more difficult
than most of us were expecting, and
resulted in almost everyone end-
ing up on the floor at some point!
Once we’d mastered the ability to
actually hit the ball rather than the
leaves, we played a couple of “seri-
ous” chukkas and the score was re-
ally close at 7-5. Then, when we’d
had enough of being “serious” we
brought out the panto-ponies!! This
certainly got us plenty of atten-
tion, lots of photos, including ones
taken with a woman out for her hen
party and a random American tour-
ist, presumably to prove to their
friends that they didn’t hallucinate
a group of students wearing inflata-
ble horse-costumes playing polo in
Hyde Park! There are some amaz-
ing photos of this (especially of Jon
Matthews for some reason…) and
they’ll be going up on our website,
www.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/riding, over
the weekend so go and have a look!
Sunday also started out pretty
wet, which delayed our minibus,
but in the end we made it to FHM
Polo Club in West Sussex, where
we met Francis Matthews, our
new polo instructor. We split into
two groups for our taster sessions
and learned how to deal with our
ponies, which are just about as dif-
ferent from riding school ponies as
you could imagine, as well as how
to hit the ball…although I think my
pony kicked it for me more than I
hit it! We also learned a bit about
the rules and then played a mini-
chukka. It was great fun and I’m
pretty sure everyone that went en-
joyed themselves, with several say-
ing they were already addicted and
would be coming back for more. I
highly recommend the sport to any
speed-freak, played properly it real-
ly is fast! To make things easier it’s
best if you can ride a horse in walk
and trot without assistance before
playing polo, just so you’re not wor-
rying about what the horse is up to
too much. This usually only takes
a few riding lessons to achieve so
don’t be put off by it.
If you have any questions about
either riding or polo, or if you’d like
to have a go at either, please get in
touch with us on riding@imperial.
ac.uk. We ride every Wednesday af-
ternoon and our next polo session
will be on Sunday 10th December.
Riders or polo players of any abil-
ity can be catered for. Also anyone
interested in borrowing/buying the
horses costumes for bar nights, fan-
cy dress parties etc. get in touch.
Pantomime polo in Hyde park!
Panto-ponies ready for action, plus random American who couldn’t quite believe she wasn’t hallucinating
the meantime, areas in which med-
ical students can get involved are
ample and include raising aware-
ness about MSF and its projects
and raising funds for MSF as it is
a non-governmental organization
and relies on donations from the
public.
With this in mind, a group of 5th
year IC medics came up with the
idea of holding a talent competition
in aid of MSF. Since an event of this
type had never been held at ICSM
we hoped it would attract a lot of
interest.
After months of planning, the
night was finally upon us. With the
sense of excitement and anticipa-
tion in the air, the audience started
arriving and before we knew it the
student bar was heaving. The event
proved to be very popular indeed. It
was inevitable that with a £100 cash
prize up for grabs for the first-place
winner the standard of the perform-
ing acts was going to be very high.
And they didn’t disappoint; our two
judges on the night were (Dr) Adam
Kay, who we all know and love for
the crude medical spin he puts on
well known pop songs, and Jenni-
fer Van Griethuysen of the Medsin
Imperial committee. Between the
judges and the show presenters,
Richard Moss and Martin Bailey,
the humorous banter and cheeky
comments between acts added to
the entertainment of the night.
With an audience of about 350
people, it wasn’t difficult to gage
the response to the various acts;
this was especially so for Rashad
Zafarulla’sperformance as a hu-
man beatbox who won the compe-
tition hands-down by replicating
various songs using ‘the art of vocal
percussion’. He was even brought
back on stage by Martin Bailey for
an encore in which the two of them
wowed us with an impromptu ren-
dition of The White Stripes’ ‘Seven
Nation Army’. Rashad was ex-
tremely generous in donating his
£100 prize to the evening’s cause.
In second place came the four-
some making up The Ok Go! Team
whose awesome synchronised
dance won them £50 off a meal at
Café Lazeez in South Kensington.
They were closely followed by the
exotic bellydancer Canan, who won
the third place prize of £30.
As the judges deliberated over
who the winners would be, there
was another entertainment slot in
store in the form of the Bachelor/
Bachelorette Auction in which in-
dividuals were auctioned off to the
highest bidder who then got the
pleasure of their company for an
evening along with two free cin-
ema passes which had been kindly
donated by Vue and Cineworld cin-
emas. The winning bids ranged be-
tween £12 and £35 and helped raise
even more money for the event’s
cause.
In a final effort to maximise the
amount of money raised by the
event, a raffle was held, in which a
number of donated prizes were up
for grabs. These included a number
of Toni and Guy haircuts, a meal at
Nandos and a pair of tickets for the
London Eye among other things.
All attendees were extremely gen-
erous in taking part in the raffle,
many people buying several tickets
at a time.
All in all, the first Charity Tal-
ent Show at ICSM proved to be an
extremely popular and successful
event. It would not have been pos-
sible without the hard work of the
organising committee who were
headed up by Meryem Kaya and
Samina Zaman, nor would it have
been as successful without the
volunteers who helped out on the
night, of whom we must mention
Phil Stennet who handled all the
stage and sound equipment on the
night and IC’s Jazz and Rock So-
ciety who provided the equipment
completely free of charge.
A number of companies were also
very generous in donating prizes
for our raffle, as well as donating
cash amounts to help cover costs;
the latter consisted of the British
Medical Association, the Medical
Defence Union, the Medical Protec-
tion Society and Wesleyan Medical
Sickness. Their extreme kindness
allowed all profits from the event to
go directly to MSF and enabled us
to reach a grand total of £2008.
