Party and Family Games – Buzz! Sports, Wii Sports, Singstar Legends and more
If you ever wanted to get your sis-
ter, grandad or boyfriend hooked on
gaming, now’s definitely the time to
do it, with a whole host of peripheral
silliness available this Christmas.
There’s bound to be plenty of
times during the vacuum between
greeting Santa and greeting the
new year when everyone gathers
around the warmth of the television
and turns on the usual tripe.
But this year more than ever
there’s a better option – get them
playing something genuinely fun.
You’ve got the simple and relaxed
Buzz Sports to begin with, where
every player has their own four-
button controller which they use to
answer multiple-choice questions,
TV-Quiz style.
For a bit more noise – and a bit
more embarassment – Singstar
Legends has a variety of songs that
at least someone is bound to know.
So if you find you’re not in the mood

Wii Sports – A perfect excuse to smack your annoying little brother
You know how it works – there’s
always been far too many games
to cover in such a short space, so
it’s likely you’ve missed some fan-
tastic games in 2006. Now’s the
time to catch up.
New Super Mario Bros. debut-
ed on the DS this year, giving Nin-
tendo a good excuse to return to
their 2D roots with the usual array
of bright colours, memorable level
design and soundtrack. If you’ve
had enough of playing Mario Kart
DS with businessmen on the Tube
in the morning, NSMB is a good
Christmas alternative.
There’s a lot of RTS to come in
2007, and if you need something
to tide you over, then Company
of Heroes (with Dawn of War
bundled) can be picked up for
less than £20 – a solid World War 2
strategy and a great Warhammer
40K multiplayer RTS.
If, for some reason, you didn’t
buy Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,
then the Christmas season is
sufficiently quiet to give yourself
enough time to immmerse your-
self in Tamriel. Prices vary from
platform to platform, but a PC ver-
sion is around £20. Don’t expect
sublime reality, but do expect an
immersive RPG and a hell of a lot
of dungeons.
PSP must-buys Grand Theft
Auto : Vice City Stories and Loco
Roco are still great buys, and with
the PSP charts not looking too
electifying at the moment, the lat-
ter might be one to dig around for
online – simple, obscure and great
fun, something which the DS usu-
ally does far better than the PSP
in.
But if you’d rather save up for
2007, we can’t blame you. 2006 had
a lot to show off, but as the year
winds down Felix Games looks to
the future when we’ll be bringing
you Quake: Enemy Territory,
Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Halo 3,
Assassin’s Creed, Final Fanta-
sy XII, Metal Gear Solid 4, and
many more.

line, “No, Luke. I am your winner.” The winner will get an email by
Monday 11th.
Pure Fun – Lego Star Wars II
We covered it last week, and we’re
covering it again for one simple
reason – Christmas is license sea-
son, and there’s no bigger license
than Star Wars itself.
But this isn’t a cash-in on the films,
or the children’s building blocks, or
even the original Lego Star Wars –
it’s pure fun, with more open levels,
more things to go “vwumm” and
“pishhhh” at, and more importantly
than anything else – some of the
most famous movie scenes from
history in glorious brick form.
The cast of characters is huge,
and the scope of what’s there to
unlock is similarly impressive – it’s
definitely a game to keep you busy
over the holiday. But it never gets
dull; leave the console set up with
another controller plugged in as
you play and anyone passing can
hop in, swish up a ‘saber and start
swinging away at droids and Sith
alongside you.
Let’s face it – the holiday season
is likely to make you watch the en-
tire six movies at least once. This
way, you get the joy of slashing and
force-pushing your way through the
adventure yourself.
The designers know what you
want. They’ve put in the Battle of
Hoth, because – for want of a better
description–it’sabsolutelybitching.
They’ve put in the duels with Darth
Vader because it wouldn’t be a Star
Wars game without it. This is Star
Wars with all the pretentiousness
and romance and cutscenes swept
away – and all you have left is pure,
unadulterated style.
The force is strong in this one.
And yes, that was an obvious gag.
But it feels so right.

for howling out a rendition of Rock-
et Man, you can always scream a
bit of Smells Like Teen Spirit.
No-one’s going to blame you if
you feel like doing something nor-
mal though – what about bowling?
Or boxing? Or tennis? Welcome to
Wii Sports.
If you’re going to splash out on a
Wii this Christmas, then you’ll al-
ready have this genius piece of soft-
ware bundled with it. And if you’re
still undecided over Nintendo’s
new platform, then it should be this
game that wins you over.
The equivalent of Eyetoy: Play in
the way that it shows off the Wiim-
ote, Wii Sports is a medley of great
multiplayer games that anyone can
play. They don’t require you to leap
around the room like Muhammad
Ali – though naturally, that makes it
a lot more fun.

Strategy – Medieval 2 : Total War
What better way to get into the
spirit of Christmas than to crush
all enemies of your chosen religion
before you with a crusade/jihad/
door-to-door newsletter [delete as
appropriate]? Medieval 2 gives you
the opportunity to do that without
getting chucked in prison as a re-
sult, and it’s all the better for it.
Massive, complex, deep, and yet
easy to pick up, the latest in the To-
tal War series doesn’t skimp on the
features. Religion, trade, diploma-
cy, city management, and of course
big bloody brawls far from home. It
all sounds suspiciously close to the
modern day, but Medieval 2’s peri-
od detail is so thick and delicious it
could pass for maple syrup.
Of course, if you’ve played Rome:
Total War then you may be wonder-
ing just what’s there to draw you
to this latest installment. This isn’t
the revolution that Rome was over
its predecessor, Medieval; instead,
it’s evolutionary, tweaking and add-
ing features rather than revamp-
ing. Creative Assembly’s expan-
sion packs are almost games in
themselves, and Medieval 2 is more
than enough of a difference from its
predecessor to justify splashing out
on it.
Don’t resist it. Pay homage to the
king of strategy games.

Yes, you got it. It’s-a-him. Mario
Santa’s not coming to this town
Spoof, Lego, and big furry things. It’s a recipe for good Star Wars
