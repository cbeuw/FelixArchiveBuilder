I, Gamer
T
here are a lot of
things I can’t stand
about Christmas.
Remakes of old
Christmas songs
is one. Old Christmas songs
themselves is another. Rein-
deer-oriented cartoons. Noel
sodding Edmunds. But I guess
what really gets to me are the
people who say it’s so commer-
cialised that Christmas doesn’t
mean anything any more, and
that somehow we’ve become
monkey wrenches of The Man.
See, the thing is that every-
thing is commercialised now.
Music. Noel Edmunds. Even
gaming – hell, especially gam-
ing – is a commercial entity.
Commercialism is good, it gives
drive to people – and when
it works it works very well.
We get Half-Life 2, the Total
War series, and Tomb Raider.
Granted, it churns out a lot of
crap, not unlike Noel Edmunds,
but that’s a fact of life.
But why we’re worried about
commercialism when it’s bring-
ing us some of the best technol-
ogy and experiences yet – from
the scale of Battlefield 2142 to
the innovative design of Wii
Play – I can’t work out. What-
ever happens on the stock mar-
ket, money’s made by selling
what’s good, and what people
want. And generally – gener-
ally mind, Crazy Frog Racer
still managed to spawn a se-
quel – people want originality,
fun, clever design, and so that’s
what they get.
So yes, the motivation be-
hind a lot of good things could
be selfishness at its heart. But
that doesn’t make its outcome
any less special. Which is why
this week we’re not only happy
to bring you the lowdown on
the best games of the festive
season, but also offer you to the
chance to win some tasty, nut-
meg-flavoured freebies from
the good people out there in
gaming land.
Despite it being the Christ-
mas coverage this issue,
there’s still one more event to
cover this year. Next week we
see the final piece of the next-
gen puzzle fall into place with
the release of the Nintendo Wii,
as well as asking you for your
help with our plans for next
term. But until then, enjoy the
absence of snow and the omni-
presence of green spikey trees
both on TV and off, and start
budgeting for the most gam-
ing-heavy month of the year.
Peace and Noel Edmunds to
you all.

All we want for Christmas
Felix Games lets you know the best of the games vying for your wallet this year
A
nd so this is Christmas.
Now, we don’t want to
alarm you, but as you
read this there are less
than twenty-five shop-
ping days until Christmas day, and
a mere two weeks (or less, if you’ve
lazily picked this up mid-week) un-
til you kiss goodbye to Imperial un-
til 2007. And that can only mean one
thing.
It’s time to get spending and
buy the love and affection of those
around you in the name of capital-
Massively Multiplayer – Battlefield 2142
There’s something about playing
against humans that can’t be beat-
en. Sure, you can ace Unreal Tour-
nament on Godlike AI levels, but
when you lead a squad of five real
people into a battle and outwit your
fellow man – even if he is a twelve
year-old Dane – it’s an entirely oth-
er experience.
Building on the success of Battle-
field 2, a game which rejuvenated
the MMOFPS genre with a revised
squad system and better online con-
nectivity, Battlefield 2142 takes the
franchise into the future, where glo-
bal warming has racked the Earth’s
surface and there is only war!
Okay, so no-one’s dishing out
points for plot here. The important
thing is that 2142’s technical side is
a huge improvement on its rather
shaky predecessor, which eventu-
ally became a shining example of
everything that was wrong about
Electronic Art’s attitude to game
publishing.
Servers are more stable, the lev-
els are more fluidly designed, and
the game rewards teamwork even
more than before, with upgrades
for squads that consistently co-op-
erate to achieve objectives.
With Quake:Enemy Territory still
a few months off, and Planetside
slowly sliding into the abyss, 2142 is
the MMO to get this season if you
want large-scale combat without
paying a monthly fee.
Don’t make a purchase expect-
ing this to be Unreal Tournament,
though – you won’t get the most out
of it unless you’re willing to work to-
gether as a team. Give it a chance,
however, and DICE’s multiplayer
vision begins to shine through.
Chart Prediction – 7

BF2142 – Fight on the ground, or take apart a ship from the inside
First-Person Shooter – Gears Of War
Gears Of War – when explosive devices and testosterone collide
Christmas is a time when you sit
down with friends and family and
engage in some bonding activi-
ties like Uno, ignoring the Queen’s
speech, or – if you’re an XBox 360
owner – dismembering large num-
bers of alien invaders.
Gears of War might have the kind
of character lineup that makes the
WWF look well-cast and realistic,
but it’s not as dumb or as trigger-
happy as it looks.
Well, alright, it is as trigger-happy
as it looks. But it’s also very so-
phisticated – a stellar first-person
shooter that’s not based around a
one-man army. Oh no. It’s based on
a four-man army.
Co-operation is the name of the
game here, and playing this game
through with a friend or two is not
only great fun but also surprisingly
tense – you begin to sink into the
war against the hostile alien force
known as The Locust Horde, and
despite it’s frenetic action and lib-
eral use of gore, it still manages to
be a scary experience – helped in
part to an incredibly smooth look
that still has the next-gen “I can’t
believe it’s so detailed” sheen.
Multiplayer doesn’t accurately
describe playing Gears of War
– if you’ve got a friend and a spare
controller, you can’t be without
this game this Christmas. A fresh
change from the same old death-
match encounters – until someone
‘accidentally’ shoots you...
Chart Prediction – 2

Freeware/Indie Gaming – N
Although we pretend to want free-
roaming, non-linear masterpieces
with eye-aching graphics and an
epic narrative, most gamers are
not averse to the simple things in
life. From ‘Avoid Missing Ball For
High Score’ to Quake III we’re just
as happy with something genuine-
ly refined and polished as we are
with a game that offers depth and
complexity.
N is simple. A quick glance at
a screenshot – a quick glance at
the name – and you can tell this.
N’s clean, crisp yet fondly retro
graphics and simple, yet strangely
stressful, gameplay provide a blend
smoother than Master Chief’s
freshly polished visor.
N combines the Fun ethics of
classic arcade games development
with the ‘What If?’ mentality of
the underground/bedroom coding
scene. The ‘real life’ physics engine
combines with the classic platform-
ing recipe to create a fast-paced
against-the-clock gaming experi-
ence which is absolutely, blissfully,
free of charge.
Small enough for 56k users yet
enduring enough for even the most
adept platform gamer, N succeeds
in every way great games of its type
should.
Chart prediction – It’s too good
for that.

ism! And we don’t have much time!
But in amidst all the generosity,
love, compassion and peace to all
men, you may find yourself forget-
ting one thing: buying stuff for your-
self is awesome. And we’re defi-
nitely under the impression that, as
stuff goes, games are the best kind
of stuff available.
Christmas, as you also might have
gathered, means new games. And
not just any new games – sizzlingly
brilliant games that have been in
development and below the radar
N – We’ll be seeing more from N after Christmas – get practicing!
of the press for the best part of the
year. In the last few weeks and the
few still to come, 2006’s most antici-
pated releases hit the shops and the
online stores – not to mention a host
of price drops and bundles for the
consoles. But what’s worth taking a
look at this season, and what should
be left until the January sales of
2009? You can find our genre-by-
genre run down of the best games
for Christmas 2006 right here.
And for the three of you in the au-
dience that feel there’s something
missing from this line-up – well,
there is. But fear not, because next
week Felix Games will endeavour
to give you a rundown of the best
Wii games available.
Right now, though, it’s not their
turn. It’s time to take a sneak peek
into Santa’s sack and see what the
good boys and girls are getting. And
if that’s still not enough for you,
check over the page to see an allur-
ing selection of gaming tat just ask-
ing to have money wasted on it.
See you on Oxford Street.
