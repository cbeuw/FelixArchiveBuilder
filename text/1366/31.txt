Cyclists fly on downhill track
No matter how hard you look there are no nakedness or subtle arse shots this week, I promise. I know you’re still looking - stop it!

For a change, the sun was shining
as we set out to on our way to Aston
Hill. After a quick one hour drive
and supermarket stop we arrived at
our local downhill and cross coun-
try spot ready for a full day’s riding.
Luckily the heavens hadn’t opened
up the day before like the weather
man said they would, so most of the
tracks were dry and ready for some
mud-free riding.
There are a multitude of downhill
tracks at Aston hill as well as a fair-
ly good cross country course and
we set out doing all of them except
the cross country.
My favourite was the 4X track
with big burrs and smooth ramps
which then leads into the bottom
half of DH3, another very good run.
There were no major injures ex-
cept to our egos, with Kofi “the fly-
ing man” Danso doing as his nick-
name suggests and leaving his bike
behind, landing on his knees at the
bottom of the same drop twice, and
James “topple over” Atteck not be-
ing able to get his feet out of the
clip pedals fast enough and keeling
over at the starting blocks of the 4X
track in front of a group of 12 year
olds. Oh, how they laughed.
Eventually though the day drew
to a close. With rain beginning to
fall and a group of very tired cyclist,
we loaded up the van and set off
back taking a “scenic detour” north
on the M1 back to London.
The Ladies 1sts faced Brunel, away,
last Wednesday. Yes, the team who
beat us 9-1 only a few weeks ago!
Thankfully, spirits were high as we
knew we had improved in leaps &
bounds since that black day.
We only lost, more narrowly than
the score suggests, 3-1; Partly due
to the fact that two of their goals
should have been disallowed. The
first was at the very end of half
time. Roxy was off due to a ball be-
ing smacked into her hand, so IC
were a man down as we have no
subs, according to our coach the
halftime should have gone when
they managed to sneak one past
us. The 2nd was stopped by Debs
on the line & the umpire called it
over even though three IC players
clearly saw it didn’t.
Despite this controversy and yet
another defeat our team left the
pitch smiling. It was our best match
to date; we all clicked as a team
with great improvement all round.
The team play on the pitch has
been a bit of a struggle this season
withoverhalfoursquadbeingfresh-
er’s. After a lot of hard work & en-
thusiasm we seem to have our team
in order; the inter-play between
Kate, as centre-mid, and Roxy, on
the left wing, was exemplary. Vicky
& Pru created a whirlwind upfront
leaving the Brunel defenders op-
tion less at every free hit. Both Shiv
& Anna’s, left and right-mid respec-
tively, work rate was exceptional
high; as always. Lil’ Han managed
to push more than her fair weight
around the pitch and Deborah was
always where she was needed.
Flustered Brunel never managed
to score from their countless short
corners due to Hannah’s aggres-
sive running and courageous dives
from our goalie Sam, once she had
put her shoulder back in place!
There was 100% commitment
shown by the whole team and Alex,
our coach, was very proud; an en-
joyable afternoon of hockey.
