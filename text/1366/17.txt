Celia Birtwell scarves
Designing for Topshop,
her scarfs are a cute ad-
dition to any casual outfit.
Less cute are her various
tops and dresses which
look like something the
villager's in Borat would
wear. They have more
than an undertone of
boho about them.

Britney Spears
And she was doing so
well. She cut off the ex-
tensions wore a margin-
ally less slutty dress, I
thought she's make out of
it with a decent come-
back. Then came Paris
Hilton. Back to the ratty
extensions and crotch
flashing papprazzi. Classy.
I'll spare you the picture.

Yuletide party dresses, y'all

The Christmas season is of-
ficially upon us. Which means
buying a pretty dress going out
and getting drunk in celebration
of the birth of Jesus Christ. In
homage to Jesus, I've picked out
a few party dresses, selected for
their skill in straddling the line
between slutty and pretty.
If you want to look on trend,
then definitely go for gold. Every
high-street chain will have a
version of that shimmering gold
dress. Just make sure you tone
down the accessories. Add more
glitz and people won't be able to
look directly at you, lest they be
blinded. This look is best acces-
sorized in black. Also a fashiona-
ble look is goth-romantic, to wear
with plenty of black eyeliner.
To cut down on time spent in
the changing room, there are
some basic rules to find a flatter-
ing dress for your body shape.
If you're curvy (Read: political-
ly correct version of fat) then a
plunging neckline is best to draw
attention to your best feature.
If you're more hourglass, then a
belted A-line dress will look great
on your curves.
For lean figures, a strapless
dress looks best, drawing atten-
tion to your delicate shoulders.
Ruffles on your bust, despite
what fashion magazines tell you,
does not add curves. It's just a
bunch of ruffles stuck to a flat
chest. If people actually mistake
this for voluptuousness then they
are retarded.
Petite figures look best in
a high waisted design whose
hemline hits just below the knee.
Most of the work is really done
by very high heels; there's only
so much a dress can do.
If you're tall then short dresses
look best with long legs. Avoid
long dresses, they will make you
look like a giant. You can also
get away with bold prints. Wear
heels at your peril.
Athletic figures look balanced
out with a flowing feminine
silhouette. If you' have the calves
of a Hungarian shot-putter, then
a hemline hitting at mid-calf is
most flattering.
Alternatively eschew all fash-
ion advice and spend eternity in
a changing room cursing the 6
item changing-room rule, even-
tually ending buying a T-shirt. If
you follow one piece of advice let
it be this, avoid Oxford Street at
all costs. You're less likely to be
crushed to death by tourists on
High Street Kensington. Happy
shopping.
