Night of A-Muse-ment at Wembley
Those crazy classic-rock-raping, nu-prog-rocking West Country bumpkins play at the Wembley Arena
“When the conspiracies unwind,
will you slam shut or free your
mind?” Lead vocalist Matthew
Bellamy soars above the collective
shouts of the many thousands in
Wembley Arena during the mind-
melting track that is Exo-Politics;
simultaneously bursting the ultra-
sound barrier with his incredible
voice range and cryptic lyrics and
breaking down the walls with his
ambitious, sumptuous guitar riffs.
Muse are back in London, and
are certainly nothing but the super-
massive band millions have regard-
ed them as ever since their modern
classic, Origin of Symmetry, burst
onto the music scene back in 2001.
After a strangely poor opening act
named The Noisettes, involving a
lead vocalist that insisted on do-
ing canine impressions (and at one
point actually squealing so loudly
most of the audience covered their
ears in distress), thousands were
even more desperate for what they
came for. The wait was intense; all
eyes were on the stage. Suddenly,
the lights dimmed, and the back-
ground music faded into nothing.
They had arrived.
Take A Bow opened, and instantly
the crowd surged forwards, crush-
ing everyone and everything within
reach: the screams, the shouts, the
cries of joy and pain all culminated
when the three progressive rockers
(Ugh, prog-rock, I feel dirty – Ed)
were illuminated by eerie light-
ing originating from all manner
of strange, almost hallucinogenic
large contrivances.
Initially playing the entirety of
their latest album, Black Holes and
Revelations, in the track order, you
might have thought that nothing
would have come as a surprise to
the dedicated progressive rock fan
in the audience.
Muse, consisting of lead vocal-
ist and guitarist Matthew Bellamy,
bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and
drummer Dominic Howard, are
well known for their energetic live
performances, but this is surely the
understatement of the millennium:
energetic does not do this live per-
formance justice in the slightest.
Personally, I was astonished at
the astounding quality of each and
every song I had the pleasure of
cascading around the arena to. Eve-
ry single track was far superior to
the album version equivalent, and
being an award-winning album of
symphonic, melodious excellence,
this is certainly saying something.
Supermassive Black Hole was,
simply, the zenith of contempo-
rary guitar rock music; a brilliantly
catchy riff and a guitar solo second-
to-none. The vast amount of violent
head-banging, passionate air-guitar
playing and the animated, synchro-
nized escalations of members of the
audience proved so overwhelming-
ly mind-bending that the bizarre,
hypnotic lighting effects made little
live review

difference to the state of thousands
of psyches.
Time is Running Out, perhaps
one of Muse’s most famous tracks
from their Absolution album, again
superseded the album version con-
siderably. The eclectic drum-work
of Dominic Howard launched this
piece of apocalyptic-themed mu-
sic into orbit; complete strangers,
separated from their own compan-
ions, suddenly put arms around
shoulders and cried into the night:
“We can’t push it underground/we
can’t stop it screaming out/how did
it come to this?”
Sure enough, nothing was stop-
ping the enthusiastic, elated Muse
fans from transforming Wembley
Arena into the most vibrant mosh-
pit environment I have ever experi-
enced. When the metallic Assassin
made its debut, several large rings
were formed on the arena floor, and
as the guitar riffs suddenly hit home
tens of people leapt into each other,
resulting in numerous concussions
and multiple injuries; I was quite
stunned to see a body fly past me
and impact the floor moments later,
only to rapidly recover and rejoin
the melee.
Perhaps the greatest highlight of
the night was the spaghetti-west-
ern styled album closer Knights
of Cydonia. Following on from the
emotional, piano-driven perform-
ance of Hoodoo, this burst into life
along with thousands of members of
the audience; even those in the so-
called seating areas – all of whom
had long begun to attempt to be as
preposterously insane as those in
the standing area – could not resist
leaping over chairs and copying my
outstandingly good air guitar skills.
The guitar solo at the end of the
track, which has become some-
thing of a legend among Muse fans,
was so perfectly played by Mat-
thew Bellamy, and backed up by the
heavy-duty bass-lines of Chris Wol-
stenholme, that no-one, and I mean
no-one, could control themselves.
During the two-minute closing se-
quence, I accosted two complete
strangers and demonstrated my
immaculate yet imaginary guitar
skills whilst blaring the lyrics in
their general direction; within sec-
onds they accepted this strange,
overexcited entry into their lives
and did exactly the same thing, only
to realize they had been doing this
already for quite a long time.
Drenched in various liquids of
unknown origin, Muse continued
to fulfil the audience’s hopes and
dreams by playing a host of older
Muse tracks, including Plug In
Baby, their cover of Feeling Good,
Hysteria, Sunburn, New Born and
Bliss, the latter of which was ac-
companied by large, suspiciously
gelatinous balloons which, in com-
parison to the mysterious concen-
tration of “Happy 18th Birthday”
balloons and inflated contracep-
tives drifting around the arena floor
prior to Muse’s entry, proved far
more appeasing.
Stockholm Syndrome was cho-
sen as the closer; the antithesis to
exit music chosen for most gigs of
this magnitude, which tend to opt
for more slowly-paced, emotive
tracks. Muse’s closing number was
a monstrously virulent track, with
its pounding bass-lines, sonorant
drumming and absolutely electrify-
ing guitar riffs propelling the crowd
into a different musical dimension.
This was pure, explosive guitar-
flavoured energy; there was noth-
ing moving about this track, unless
of course one refers to the physical
displacement we all experienced;
even more so than that of Super-
massive Black Hole. I found out
first hand just how successfully
a few of us in unison could propel
ourselves towards the ceiling whilst
blaring out the memorable chorus
time and time again.
Leaving this gig just barely intact
and positively buzzing with energy,
I was unexpectedly hit by the tinge
of disappointment. There were
so many tracks Muse could have
played, but opted not to, including
the 1984-esque Citizen Erased, ar-
guably their most epic track. I could
not help pondering on why this, and
other Muse ‘classics’, including
Butterflies & Hurricanes, Falling
Down, Apocalypse Please, Fall-
ing Away With You, Megalomania
were not played.
However, shortly afterwards, the
answer dawned on me: almost eve-
ry Muse track is deemed a classic
by the millions of fans spread across
the world, and there simply isn’t
enough time to showcase them all
in a two-hour slot. The ideal Muse
fan’s gig would simply be for the
band to play every single song they
have composed, no matter how long
it took to perform. Megalomania,
the closer to Origin of Symmetry,
replaces religion with music, and
could easily be compared to reality.
Many bands have a large following,
but I can say without the slightest
doubt that the following of Muse
borders on the religious.
Despite whatever bias may arise
from being this obsessive with the
progressive rockers’ (So, so dirty -
Ed) musical talents, I can think of
no better way of putting this: Muse
are undeniably the best of their
kind, and their live performance
not only demonstrates this, but sets
the standard for hundreds of bands
around the world today.
