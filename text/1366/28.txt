Following morale boosting per-
formances with 4 wins out of 4 in
the first one-day event of London
Winter League, dD Mixed set off
to Sussex University and South-
East Mixed Indoor Regionals with
high hopes, a great set of costumes
for the Medieval themed party and
even a choreographed routine.
Southern Trains did their best to
make us miss our first game, but a
small scheduling tweak and some
good hustle at Lewes station, saw
the bulk of the team reinforce the 4
girls and one guy who had the fore-
sight to drive. With only 5 minutes
to change, the first game, against
newcomers Chichester, was going
to be tough. Chichester boasted
some experience female GB play-
ers and one mature PhD student
of long experience. The game was
very tight, with both teams playing
high tempo man-on-man defense.
dD relied on the experience of Dirk
and Stylish to sneak a small lead
and eventually take the game 5-4.
The post match activities saw us
introduce the first of our medieval
games, Chicken Shoot, where we
forced one member of the opposi-
tion to be the target for one their
teammates armed with a rubber
bow and arrow.
Our next match was against the
host university’s second team, Mo-
hawks II, and was another stumble
onto the pitch affair. The game be-
gan with the dD’s taking a comfort-
able lead; forcing Mohawks to play
their only 3 women whenever pos-
sible. Mohawks scored a few points
late on, but the game ended 7-3 in
Imperial’s favour.
Our second medieval game con-
sistedofbum-slapfencingwiththree
players picked from each team.
Mohawks managed a moral victory
with one of their girls promptly dis-
patching all our players!

our pool of 4 teams and guarantee
a top 8 finish; in the way stood our
bitter rivals (and friends), Thrown,
of Kings College London. The dD’s
have never beaten Thrown indoors,
whilst Thrown have never beaten
the dD’s in outdoor Ultimate.
Our confidence was high, as
Thrown had just lost to Chichester.
Unfortunately, whilst our commit-
ment was there, we lacked a tac-
tical plan for dealing with Kings’
zonal defense. We turned over pos-
session too often and were pun-
ished over and over again, the final
result being our heaviest loss of the
weekend at 3-8.
A three-way tie at the top of our
pool saw us relegated to third and
a lowly seeding of 12th. We still had
a chance of top 8 in the shape of a
crossover game against 5th seeds
UCL. Our fellow Londoners were
also fans of the zone defence; this
time we were better prepared. The
opening four points were traded
evenly, but disaster struck; a couple
of cheap mistakes gifted UCL a 4-
2 lead. This was too much for one
of players, resulting in a dropped
kicked bottle and an enforced “cool-
down” by our captain who refused
to be flustered.
Despite the pressure, dD rallied,
scoring two quick points and tak-
ing possession of the disc in the
sudden-death overtime point. UCL
threw up a wall of 4 players on their
endzone line, forcing us to patiently
swing disc from sideline to sideline
looking for an opening. Nervous
minutes past, but Dirk, Mary and
MadK handled calmly and finally
forced the opening to take the game
5-4, securing a place in the top 8
for Sunday. The toughness of our
pool was revealed when it turned
out that Chichester, Thrown and
ourselves secured 4th, 5th and 6th
seeds respectively, out of 16 teams.
With our games complete, we re-
turned to our host’s house for pizza,
a quick round of ring of fire and
most importantly our Men in Tights
costumes. We had a blast at the
party and danced the night away.
There were several candidates for
the sharking prize, but I’ll mention
no names, they know who they are.
Sunday morning saw us back in
Sussex, on the pitch for the first
game of the day against Royal
Holloway.
With the success of our costumes
at the party, it was decided to play
the day’s game wearing our tights
(in the case of one player, only his
tights). A mixture of hangovers,
tiredness, and their 6’7’’ monster
of a player left us feeling a little
apprehensive at the start of this
game. The dD’s used a zone to re-
strict their star player’s options.
Our girls all played chase, running
after the disc in defense, whilst the
boys took zonal places further up
the field, marking out the area in
which to throw. The tactic worked,
producing many turnovers, which
we punished ruthlessly, ending the
game 15-4.
Holloway were the first team to
see our fully choreographed rou-
tine; singing of the main theme
of Men in Tights, complete with
can-can.
With a top 6 place secure, we
went into our next game, a rematch
against Chichester, with high hopes
of making the top 4 and qualifying
for Mixed Nationals.
Hoping to replicate the success of
our zonal defense in our last game,
we threw it again, hoping to pressu-
rise Chichester from the start. The
first point was very long, Chiches-
ter held possession, with surprising
confidence, eventually finding a gap
through our lines to score.
Our offence struggled and we
soon found ourselves on the wrong
end of an 8-3 score line. A mini-re-
surgence in the last few minutes
wasn’t enough and we went down
7-10. The highlight of the game was,
fresher, Emma scoring; ensuring
the whole team had scored over the
weekend. Chichester went on to fin-
ish 3rd.
We still had a shot for 4th place,
via the 4-5 qualification final, but
we needed to beat our bogey team,
Thrown, whom we were to play
again. This time, we were better
prepared, matching their zone with
our own. The first point was difficult
with Thrown going close on two oc-
casions, but we turned them over
and scored.
The next three points were trad-
ed evenly then Thrown scored two
quick points, we responded bring-
ing the score back to 4-4. Nerves
struck during this point, with both
teams going close- it was Kings
who scored. With just over a minute
left, we fought hard and came very
close, conceding only in the dying
seconds with Thrown taking the
game 4-6.
The weekend ended with dD lying
in 6th place, representing the best
indoor finish for Imperial in the last
3 years.
