to be given by Peter Sutherland, the
Chairman of BP
, Chairman of Gold-
man Sachs and UN Special Repre-
sentative for Migration.
Mr. Sutherland was due to deliver
a lecture on “Europe’s Place in the
World in the 21st Century”. Just
as the event was about to begin 15
students from LSE entered the hall
and sat on the stage. They carried
banners drawing attention to al-
leged environmental and human
rights abuses of Mr. Sutherland.
The students obstructed Mr.
Sutherland on his way to the po-
dium and declared that they would
stay until LSE held a student-wide
referendum. Both LSE and Mr.
Sutherland declined, and the event
was promptly moved to a different
venue. Student press and protes-
tors were prevented from entering
the new venue by LSE security,
whilst Police and Community Sup-
port Officers removed protestors.
The anti-Sutherland camp claims
that in his position as Chairman of
BP
, Mr. Sutherland has been respon-
sible for environmental and human
rights abuses. These are said to in-
clude the Prudhoe Bay Alaskan Oil
Spill, where BP spilled 265,000 oil
barrels after being fined in 2002 for
illegally failing to install a leak de-
tection system promptly; the Baku-
Tbilisi-Cehyan (BTC) Oil Pipeline,
where BP’s contracts have over-
ridden social and environmental
legislation and undermined human
rights and similar infractions con-
cerning pipelines in West Papua,
Colombia and the North Sea.
The LSE Council comprises of lay,
academic and student members,
all of whom are elected to their
positions. Its task is described as
‘overall determination of strategy’
at LSE. The role of the Court of
Governors is to receive reports
from the Council and the Director,
to appoint Directors of the School
and discuss major issues on the de-
velopment of the school.
The student campaign against
Mr. Sutherlands appointment be-
gan after student governors raised
objections at the Court of Gover-
nors meeting that ratified the ap-
pointment. Despite the objections
raised a unanimous vote, in which
student governors were allowed to
vote, ushered Mr. Sutherland into
the Court in March 2006. A state-
ment from LSE said: “The Court of
Governors approved Peter Suther-
land’s appointment as chair in 2008
by acclamation. Student represent-
atives were on the Selection Com-
mittee, the Council and the Court,
and consulted throughout.
“Many LSE governors or Council
members are involved with other
private and public businesses or
organisations, and would often
declare an interest to colleagues,
but are still, of course, able to of-
fer their views on whatever subject
might arise.”
Mr. Sutherland is expected to take
over as Chairman in January 2008.
A term as Chairman lasts three
years after which a second term is
possible. The current Chair, Lord
Grabiner, has been exceptional in
the position and has therefore been
granted three terms. His third
term is due to end in December
2007 when Peter Sutherland shall
succeed him.
Howard Davies, Director of LSE,
said:“MyacademiccolleaguesandI
are delighted that Peter Sutherland
has agreed to join us and, in time,
to take on the Chairmanship of the
School. His background in public
policy and his business and inter-
national interests match the LSE’s
profile remarkably well. We look
forward to the School continuing to
prosper under his leadership.”
A petition was started immediate-
ly after the appointment was made
public and prominent student rep-
resentatives voiced concerns. The
protestors aim to force Mr. Suther-
land to decline the Chair.
A spokesperson for the students
said: “Many students are dismayed
at this appointment and there is a
broad coalition that want to make it
clear that we do not want someone
with Sutherland’s abysmal track
record of human rights and envi-
ronmental abuses to be the figure-
head of our university.
LSE is famed for it’s commitment
to social justice and human rights
and this appointment contradicts
our founding aims and ethos. LSE
students protested over the ap-
pointment of a director associated
with racial segregation in the 1960’s
so similarly we are now protesting
against someone associated with
environmental degradation and hu-
man rights abuses.”
Mr. Sutherland also has a formi-
dable reputation in business; he
has previously held the positions
of Competition Commissioner for
the EU and Director General of the
World Trade Organisation. Some
students fear this will adopt a pro-
business stance including meas-
ures such as raising the cap on tui-
tion fees.
A student spokesperson said:
“We also see it as another clear in-
dication that the School is embrac-
ing an increasingly marketised per-
spective and increase tuition fees
even more. Our aim was to make it
clear to Sutherland and the School
that students oppose his appoint-
ment and the way it was made, giv-
en that LSE has not listened to us.
The appointment was railroaded
through without any acknowledge-
ment of our concerns. Tonight we
forced them to listen to us and we
hope they will take notice.”
James Caspell, a student rep-
resentative on LSE Council said:
“LSE used to be the home of social
democracy, whereas now its busi-
ness links are getting stronger and
this sends a negative message to
students who have not yet applied
but are put off by LSE’s increas-
ingly marketised approach to social
sciences.”

Babar Ahmed loses fight to avoid extradiction
Former IC staff member loses final appeal against his extradiction to the US for “running terrorist websites”

A former employee of the College
has lost his legal fight to avoid be-
ing extradicted to the US on terror
charges.
Babar Ahmed, who worked in Me-
chanical Engineering, was arrested
in August 2004 on charges of setting
up and administering websites that
were allegedly used to raise mon-
ey to train Taleban fighters and
Chechen rebels, as well as printing
material that praised ‘holy war’ and
incited murder.
Mr Ahmed’s supporters claim
that after being arrested, he was
“brutally assaulted” by officers
from the Metropolitan Police, and
was later released without charge.
They also criticise the current ex-
tradiction treaty between the UK
and the US that allows the US to
request extradiction of a person in
UK custody without the need to pre-
vent the available evidence to a UK
court for consideration. A number
of British civil rights groups have
also attacked the treaty for similar
reasons.
Mr Ahmed’s appeal was rejected
on the grounds that it could not be
proved that he would be treated un-
fairly should he be extradicted to
the US. There has been widespread
outcry at the US government’s
use of “extraordinary rendition”
and allegations of torture author-
ised by officials within Bush’s
administration.
His case was ruled on at the same
time as that of Haroon Aswat, who
has been accused of setting up a
camp to train terrorists to fight
in Afghanistan. He has also been
linked by US authorities to the in-
famous radical cleric, Abu Hamza.
US officials claim that the two plot-
ted to set up what they call a “ji-
had training camp” in the state of
Oregon.
The only legal route left for Mr
Ahmed, Mr Aswat and their sup-
porters is to appeal to the House
of Lords. The judges ruling on the
case are currently sitting to dis-
cuss whether this appeal will be
allowed.
The Union currently has a policy
of supporting Mr Ahmed, passed
at Council in December 2004 under
controversial circumstances and
allegations of intimidation.
