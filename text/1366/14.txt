album review
Born Warren Anderson Mathis in
the small mill-town of LaGrange,
Georgia, Bubba Sparxxx burst onto
the scene in 2001 wearing overall
and driving a tractor in the video
Ugly, the Timbaland-produced fre-
netic hit single from Bubba’s gold-
selling debut Dark Days, Bright
Nights. The Charm is an unim-
pressive attempt at repeating the
success of his first album. But give
credit it’s due; Bubba has certainly
worked hard on this album, even
with the soulful The Otherside, a
copy-cat of Deliverance; Bubba
did try to outwit us with his genius
and urban farm-boy tales, but it all
sounds like a plea to embrace hip

I
didn’t get much of a reaction
about my insensitivity over
the death of Feeder’s old
drummer. So I can assume
several things: pretty much
no-one cares about music; pretty
much no-one cares about Feeder;
pretty much no-one reads this
column and communicating with
another human being in any form
is beyond you. In this case, here
comes the lengthiest tirade of
racism, homophobia and misogy-
ny you’ll ever choose not to read.
So if you’re a black, feminist les-
bian who is easily shocked, then
please scratch out your eyeballs
now!
Only kidding, I love/hate all
God’screaturesinequalamounts.
What to talk about this week I
wonder. Well, maybe I should talk
about myself! You should get to
know me, so that if I’m walking
along you won’t hesitate to have a
chat with me. I often walk around
waiting for an amazing conversa-
tion to eclipse the purpose of my
walk in the first place.
I am from a place in the Mid-
lands called Nottingham, or more
specifically a suburb of the city
(on the southerly edge) called
West Bridgford. Nottingham is
often associated with gun crime,
but in my experience of the city
late at night, this isn’t completely
true; I have never been shot at,
just punched a few times. My
star-sign is Aries and I would
say I am quite passionate about
things (including your mother).
My favourite music can be de-
scribed as alternative. This broad
genreencompassesmanysounds,
chords and keys. I like guitars, in-
teresting sounds, crazy and loud
drumming. I also like noise; when
it is used efficiently and with
precision it can make more of a
statement than anything. I be-
lieve that punk is not dead and it
is not defined as the music made
by Green Day et al.. Punk is an
idea of rejection and so much mu-
sic around now is only a show of
rejection. I guess politically, I am
liberal; even though punk ethics
and ideals inspire me, I am very
pragmatic.
I enjoy a good book. This does
not mean Robert Jordan fantasy
novels or Dan Brown; it means
literature which challenges your
perception of the role of litera-
ture itself. I am not elitist or a
snob, I just hate complacency;
one should not establish one’s
identity to be storm-proof, to be
enlightened by different ideas is
what made humanity progress.
I am constantly interested in
new ideas: superficially in music
and overall. This may sound like
a lonely hearts column but I gen-
uinely like talking to people about
interesting stuff. GSOH. Call me.
Two suited and booted Parisian
DJs glide into their all-too-familiar
throne set high above an authentic
Buenos Aires 10 piece band. Inter-
esting. So what exactly do you get
when you mix the two most sexed
nations on earth? Intercourse of
course.
The first notes from the accor-
dion wash over the crowd like the
familiar first tender kiss of a lover.
Everyone sighs. It has begun. Cool
Latino beats and fresh female vo-
cals follow, filling the air with a dirty
static I can only find in a heated
bedroom.
For those who like to close their
eyes from this point in I would say
this: you would surely be missing
out. Buenos Aires skylines, broken
Gauchos and strutting tango danc-
er visuals glide across the back of
the stage in time with an almost
dub-like step.
Teasing can only last so long.
After what seems an eternity the
DJs suddenly make their musical
entrance. Billie Jean’s bass-line
filters through the speakers and
finally takes over as musical cen-
tre. What follows is a succession of
short, sharp, swinging tunes mixing
the best of fast-paced Latin dance
with warming electronic rock.
Post-climatic, airy tango brings
you down to earth for a breather. As
usual, the pair then just disappear

Brixton Academy
live review but only to bring (MOBO award
winner) Akala back with them. How
often does round two happen that
quickly?
However, this time it seemed like
they were just going through the
motions. Akala got everyone bounc-
ing but left just that little bit too
soon. How frustrating.
Even the best have their limits
but Gotan Project seemed a little
under par this time, but everyone is
different, and this may just be me.
George Refsum
hop barn music.
Fair enough, this album does
have one or two club-friendly jams
such as Ms New Booty feat. Ying
Yang Twins: an up-tempo, bass-
heavy track, produced by Mr Col-
lipark, and a certified stripper
anthem throughout the nation; or
Heat It Up, which would truly give
an extra spring to your butt. This
album seems to have less Timbal-
and influence than FutureLoveSex
Sounds by ‘Justin Timberland’. We
also have the random Timbaland
production, Hey, an amped-up tune
built around a sparse marching
band beat complete with horns and
chants.

Fergie
Fergalicious
(Polydor)
★★★★✩
single review
Fergalicious is the second single
taken from the debut album The
Duchess. Former member of Kids
Incorporated, Wild Orchid, co-host
of the TV show Great Pretenders
and current vocalist of The Black
Eyed Peas. Fergie is to BEP as wa-
ter is to the Sahara desert.
Fergalicious is an addictive, choc-
oholic and sizzling single from Miss
Stacy Ferguson. This is definitely a
girl and club banging track and it
grows on you; before long one be-
gins to mime to the track.
“All the time I turn around
brotha's gather round always look-
ing at me up and down looking at
my (uuhh)!” This are interesting
attempts at rapping, but who can
blame her. Definitely a must have
on your iPod. Another work-out
track, at least at the end of the day
you would be as tasty as Fergie.

The Feeling
Love It When You Call
(Island)
★★★★★
single review
Taken from their debut album
Twelve Stops and Home, The Feel-
ing’s previous three singles Sewn,
Fill My Little World and Never Be
Lonely have all been top ten hits.
This five-piece English band from
Sussex and London have taken it
upon themselves to reinvent the
genre of ‘pop’ and I’ll be darned if
they haven’t done a fantastic job
at it. With instruments in sync and
harmonised, and the beautiful vo-
cals from lead singer, Dan Gillespie
Sells, can this band do any wrong
in our eyes? I think not! With lyr-
ics like “I love it when you call, but
what’s the complication, its only
conversation, he loves it when you
call.” The Feeling does not have a
female fan-base for nothing. With
lyrics like these any girl would be
able to relate it too – you’ll definitely
be singing along in no time. But the
skillfully engineered track is also
provides a little something for the
boys, with notable solos from the
keyboards and guitarist.

Some extra pickings for you my friend
Ed Harcourt and friends
Everythingmustgo
live review
Some gigs are thoroughly crippled
by their own marketing and just
can't live up to their hype. On the
other hand, some cannot fail to live
up to their promise – with little pre-
publicity and the name 'An Evening
with Ed Harcourt and Friends',
there isn't an awful lot left to the
imagination. Unsurprisingly, the
evening fulfilled its promises with
ease – a great many of his friends
performed brief sets, every one of
them including a duet with the man
himself.
It was a very informal affair, es-
pecially since about half the crowd
were performing at various points
throughout the evening, perform-
ing to a surprisingly small crowd
thanks to a combination of short
notice and an understandable reti-
cence to go out on a Monday night
(despite the gig being free - Ed).
Although some of the earlier acts
were not the most impressive, none
were anything less than enjoyable,
especially when it camw to Har-
court's duets with each. However, it
was after an hour or so of good but
unmemorable sets that the evening
really hit its stride – Danny Gof-
fey of Supergrass fame performed
a single song from his new solo
project, Van Goffey, as his first solo
gig; David Viner played a stunning
blues set; and continuing in the
Americana vein, Michael J Sheehy
then covered The Passenger in a
masterful rasping country style.
Then Sam Herlihy of the much-
missed Hope of the States debuted
his first new material in months
– a fast, rock-oriented number and
a quieter, whimsical piece which
was sadly marred by chatter from
the bar, before concluding with a
majestic duet with Harcourt on a
cover of Bill Fay's haunting Be Not
So Fearful.
Changing the tone completely,
Josh T Pearson's set was loud and
unintelligible, but no less enjoyable,
bringing down the volume for the
compulsory duet at the end. After
two such astounding sets, no-one
but Harcourt himself could follow,
ending the evening with a beautiful
rendering of Until Tomorrow Then
to a sadly depleted but extremely
appreciative audience.
