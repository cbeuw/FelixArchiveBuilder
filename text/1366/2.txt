NUS says lads’ mags
should be covered up
The National Union of Students has
attacked so-called “lads’ mags”,
calling them “overtly sexual” and
that the content is “demeaning and
degrading to women”. It has called
on outlets on NUS-affiliated univer-
sity campuses to restrict the maga-
zines to take titles like Nuts and
Zoo off the shelves and place them
behind the counter.
The magazines have also faced
calls from MPs for them to be con-
signed to the top shelves of newsa-
gents, alongside more pornograph-
ic publications such as Readers’
Wives, and a number of supermar-
kets have placed the magazines
within ‘modesty covers’ to obscure
them from casual browsers. Sains-
bury’s is the most high-profile su-
permarket to have adopted these
covers, saying it acted after com-
plaints from costumers.
The NUS National Women’s Of-
ficer, Kat Stark, said that the Na-
tional Union of Students fully sup-
ported the moves by supermarkets
to reduce the visibility of the maga-
zines to consumers, adding: “Most
of their content is demeaning and
degrading to women. NUS is there-
fore keen to see them relegated
from the top shelf to behind the
shelf throughout university outlets
as well.” The policy is voluntary, she
insisted, though some unions had
taken it up: “NUS is pleased to re-
port that a few unions have already
made the move to keep particular
‘lad mags’ behind the counter, and
we are supporting women’s officers
all over the country to lobby their
unions into following suit.”
The policy has faced criticism
and ridicule from some. At Leices-
ter University, where the union has
introduced the ban, the editor of
the student newspaper, Tom Good-
wyn, has expressed dismay that the
NUS has dictated what magazines
the outlets can stock. “Nuts and

Nuts and Zoo should be placed behind the counter, says NUS
Zoo target readers who are aged 18
to 26, a good proportion of who are
at university,” said Mr Goodwyn,
adding: “Having to buy them from
behind the counter is a bit dirty old
man-ish.” An online petition against
the ban has already gathered more
than 200 signatures.
With the recent referendum
meaning that ICU will affiliate to the
NUS, it is up to the pro-NUS group
to decide if this is a worthwhile use
of the affiliation fee, and whether
the ban should be introduced here.

Union governance changes
approved by College Council
The Governance Review being read for the first time at Union Council
The recommendations made by
the Union Governance Review is
now part of the the Union’s con-
stitution, having been approved
by the highest body in College, the
College Council.
The proposals have been a pet
project of John Collins, Union
President, who set up a number of
working groups consisting of ex-
hacks, current hacks and sabbs to
review the way the Union is run.
The most notable of the changes
enacted is the introduction of an-
other committee at the top level
of Union governance, called the
Court. The Court’s role is to rule
on disciplinary matters, including
election complaints. This should
hopefully eliminate the partisan-
ship normally involved when Coun-
cil discusses election complaints.
The Court will be staffed by life
members of the Union, along with
current members of the Union.
No current officers will be eligible
to sit on the Court. The Court will
also be the ultimate body ruling
on complaints against the student
media.
The other key change is the split-
ting of the Student Activities Com-
mittee, the body that deals with all
clubs and activities, into two halves:
the Representation and Welfare
Board, and the Clubs and Societies
Board. The aim of this seems to be
to make welfare a more important
issue than it had previously been
under the SAC.
A number of other committees
have been amalgamated, disband-
ed or renamed, including the re-
placement of the unpopular Trad-
ing and Retail Committee being
replaced with a number of ‘forums’
that interested parties may attend
to discuss the issues directly with
the staff involved.
Lastly, the Permanent Secretary,
head of the Union staff, will be re-
named Union General Manager,
reversing the change made by ex-
President Mustafa Arif.
