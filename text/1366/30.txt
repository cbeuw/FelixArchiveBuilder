Our first match of the season came
relatively late; with two different op-
positions cancelling and postponing
on us. As a result we turned up for
our first BUSA encounter greener
than we would have liked, with a
team where all, but three, had nev-
er started for the Virgins before!
Despite this, and arriving with only
14 players, we were still fired-up for
the challenge ahead.
Kent were a well drilled side; with
a squad of 19, it was a case of sink
or swim for our 11 Rugby Freshers!
Thankfully they all swam very well.
Three of our pack were equal to
the weight of one of theirs, but IC
held thier own in the first half. We
had an impeccable defence, tack-
ling furiously, pushing them back
and making the odd break. IC were
only 7-0 down at half time, despite
being a player down, and by no
means out of the game.
In the second half their superior
numbers and experience showed.
Until 60 minutes the score re-
mained 7-0, but as we tired, they
brought on all their subs; fresh legs
gave them the upper hand. Kent
scored 4 break away tries in quick
succession, IC did not have the legs
to chase them.
The weather deteriorated and
the pitch turned into a mud bath,
their forwards weight came into its
own and they held us in our own 22,
pushing over the try line a further
two further times, both of which
which were converted.
The Virgins did not give up, when
Kent thought they had complete
control, Sam Pemberton, ran in a
fantastic, team effort, try which was
the last play of the match.
Althouth IC lost, our freshers
were fantastic; managing to hold
off a much more experienced and
weighty side for 60 minutes with a
We arrived at George’s ground on
a sunny autumn day, expecting to
be the less experienced underdogs
again; we could not have been more
wrong!
It was their first match of the sea-
son and they had barely any tack-
ling practice. Again we were largely
a fresher team and only had 13,
luckily Georges did too. With two
inexperienced incomplete sides it
promised to be a far more evenly
matched contest than our previous
encounter.
Unfortunately, the referee made
the mistake of telling both sides, be-
fore the match, that this was his first
time refereeing- and it showed.
We dominated in the first half; our
backs, particularly Sam Pemberton
and Jess Alcena, took advantage of
the holes in their defence and ran in
3 and 2 tries respectively in the first
half; Sam converting one. When
the half time whistle went we had a
comfortable lead of 0-25.
However, after the break, they re-
grouped and scored a quick, break
away try. IC steadied their nerves
and a fantastic team effort lead to
a try; involving nearly everyone
and showing we can support with
the best of them. The try was exqui-
sitely finished off by fresher, There-
sa Wright, who crossed the line to
score her Virgin Try!
George’s then managed to score
3 tries, in, what seemed to be, the
blink of an eye and possibly with the
help of the referee. Fortunately IC
did not give up and both Jess and
Sam got another try each before
the full time whistle was blown.
The best part of the day was yet
to come, the George’s girls were ex-
cellent; providing us with free pizza
and booze for as long as we could
eat and drink. George’s are by far
the nicest bunch of people the Vir-
gins ever had the pleasure to play
against.
Before this glorious day which was
to be the setting for our first home
match I had never heard of Writtle
College.
When they arrived, to our amaze-
ment we discovered they were an
agricultural college from Essex,
chav farmers I hear you say, but
there was no Burberry in sight!
For the first time this season we
had a full team, as many from the
older years came to join our fantas-
tic crew of freshers.
Being our first home match of the
season we were determined to win
and we had the perfect start with
Sam Pemberton running in a quick
try against the team that size wise it
was difficult to distinguish between
them and the animals they care for.
They did however hit back and bull-
dozer a try over several members
of us, and to their credit they used
what they had well.
The score did not stay even for
long Roxanne Crossley got her Vir-
gin try after a heroic effort by our
forwards and a break away try each
from Jess Alcena and Sam.
In the second half their steamroll-
er technique awarded them three
further tries but our superior speed
and skill showed and both Jess
and Sam ran in two further tries a
piece.
I very much doubt we will meet
larger teams than this for the rest
of the season and in all honesty
this match showed just how much
potential the Virgins have and how
formidable we can and will be when
our freshers have a season under
their belt.
GKT aka Kings College School of
Medicine, Dentistry, Physiotherapy,
Biomedical Sciences, Nursing, Life
Sciences etc, etc, at the campuses
of Kings, Guys and St Thomas’ Hos-
pitals may have the longest official
name for, well, anything in history,
but bless them since they arrived
with only 11 players after being bro-
ken the previous Wednesday and
even before kick off their attitude
gave us a hint as to why. We had 16
players but they would not concede
and play a friendly so we played
under protest knowing full well we
would get the 3 points and it gave us
a chance to play some of our least
experienced freshers with the pres-
sure slightly off.
Saying this, we had no intention
of losing and once again a quick try
from Sam Pemberton showed we
meant business. We did however
not bargain for the well quite frank-
ly viciousness and dirty tactics from
many of the GKT players.
With punching, kicking and biting
they managed to even the score at
22-22 at half time, there was a great
Virgin try from Kasey as well as 3
more tries and a conversion from
Sam.
The second half was slightly less
like a one sided boxing match than
the first and as much as much as it
pains me to admit they rucked very
well and the teams were only sepa-
rated by a conversion.
GKT went 22-29 up and were still
celebrating their conversion when
Sam ran in a quick try which soon
shut them up. Unfortunately we did
not manage to kick to following con-
version and they emerged eventual
‘winners’.
I have never played in such an
ill tempered unsportsmanlike like
match and I’m very proud to say
we did not sink to their level and
despite the score we can hold our
heads up high.
