Oddoscopes
Dear Andy,
I’m a fresher and I couldn’t resist
writing, because every time I read
your horoscopes they make me
crack up so much (in the privacy
of my room of course!) Please do
more! Double horoscopes! My com-
pliments to the chef(s)!
Regards,

Andy Sykes replies,
I’m glad you like them so much; I
shall pass your compliments on to
the horoscope team the next time I
feed them their dripping, raw ani-
mal flesh through the grate in the
floor of the office.
Freedom of the
press? What’s
the point?
Dear Andy,
Love Felix ‘n’ all, but I have just one
or two gripes.
This tiresome and cliquey current
obsession with ‘freedom of speech’
in the universities’ media may
seem interesting to you, but to the
Andy Sykes replies,
How much were you willing to
bet? Damn, I should have agreed it
before.
Anyway, I don’t know where
you’re getting ‘every sodding
week’ from, unless you’re exagger-
ating for comic effect (I laughed). It
was a couple of issues at the start
of term, and to be honest, there was
absolutely no news. I was fresh
rest of us, I mean – does anybody
really care? I haven’t got a clue who
any of these people are in these
articles, besides being your fellow
‘medjia’ cohorts / lovies, and I really
don’t care. OK, perhaps this issue is
of some importance to other mere
mortal students like myself, but
- front page headlines? Every sod-
ding week? A single paragraph on
page 12 would do. We all know that
the Student Union – by definition
– is run by a clique of self-interest-
ed, power-hungry, autocratic idiots
– this is not news! Perhaps it would
be more relevant to give more focus
to articles with a broader relevance
and greater gravitas, such as your
excellent “UK universities invest
£1.5m in arms firms” article. Issues
such as this are actually relevant to
a great number of the university’s
students, not just the few belonging
to a supposed elite clique.
Betch’a don’t print this though.
Best wishes,

Dear Andy,
I am an Aeronautics postgrad who
works in office 151 of the Roderic
Hill Building. Our office’s windows
happen to open out onto the court-
yard where the chemical spill hap-
pened a few weeks ago. I take is-
sue with the fact that the Head of
Security believes everything was
handled well.
On the day of the incident, there
were three of us sitting in our office,
when a fourth colleague walked in.
He had been told to evacuate his
office (3rd floor of the Aeronautics
Department ACE extension) and
was told that “around the corner”
was safe.
So, he came to our office. After
2pm (the spill happened at 12.30),
one of our department’s techni-
cians came by and advised us that
“it may be wise to close our win-
dows.” It was at this point that we
found out that the spill was literally
directly outside and was creating
fumes. We decided of our own ac-
cord to leave the building. At no
point were we told to evacuate. We
left our office quite a long time after
the Chem Eng building had been
evacuated.
The following are the experiences
of colleagues:

Dear Andy,
I’m writing regarding the article on
the clubs’ approval delays. As my
proposed club, the IC Backgammon
Society, has been left in the limbo
state for the past month and a half,
I would be extremely disappointed
if the delay is based on some politi-
cal motives. I personally prefer the
new NCC (New Clubs Committee)
format compared with the old sys-
tem with the CSC chairs. But there
is a flaw in the system in which
there is not a mandatory period of
which the approval meeting is held
and such discretion has not been
exercised with appropriate thought
to the clubs in waiting. Surely, clubs
and societies are an integral part of
the union and higher priority shall
be given to them. I greatly appreci-
ate the work being done by the Un-
ion and I hope this can be resolved
as soon as possible.

windows opening onto the same
courtyard, one PhD student was
told at 16.30 by two Aero students to
leave the building. He never knew
about the incident.
- One staff member was told by
one security officer to leave, and
then by his partner to not evacuate.
Later, Aero staff members were
unable to leave the building due to
locked doors, which did not lead to
the courtyard.
- Security staff were seen helping
themselves to food the Chem Eng
department lays on for their under-
grads in the foyer of the ACEX.
- Four of my colleagues were in
an office on the second floor of the
ACEX and were not told to evacu-
ate. They only left once a colleague
called them saying that he could
not get into the building.
- The Aeronautics Department’s
lecture theatres overlook the court-
yard, and were still occupied by un-
dergraduates at 15.00.
I do not understand why two de-
partments located around the same
courtyard can be evacuated in such
different manners. Lessons should
be learned from situations such
as this one, such that, if there is a
more serious next time, students
and staff are not at risk due to inept
evacuation.
I am not one for frivolous health
and safety rules. If anything, they
have appeared only to create an
illusion of safety, when actually im-
portant situations such as this one
are handled so badly.
Sincerely,
Aki Pakarinen
into the job, confused, and unable
to dredge up anything more inter-
esting. Such is the life of a student
newspaper editor.
Luvvies? I barely have to time to
eat, never mind network. I’m glad
you liked my article on arms firms;
at least someone’s reading the pa-
per. You’re right about students’
unions, though, and you said it bet-
ter than I could. Fancy a job?
