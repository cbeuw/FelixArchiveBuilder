Extremism vs moderation?
I
am shaken by the article of
Saad Raja in last week’s is-
sue of Felix, celebrating the
conquest of Constantinople.
According to him, with the
consent of the European nations
(who despised the brutal dictator-
ship of Constantine XI), the di-
vinely inspired Muslim troops freed
the city from the tyrannical grip of
the Byzantine Emperor and estab-
lished a fair and just regime. This
interpretation of history is by my
understanding; clearly ridiculous,
completely biased and according
to most of the world’s historians,
wrong. I suggest to all the readers
to get informed by reading any ver-
sion of the facts that is neither bias
from the point of view of the con-
queror nor the conquered.
When I read Saad’s article I was
outraged. In my opinion, confirms
the worst stereotypes of the war-
mongering, completely biased
Muslims. I feel it is my duty, in
light of today’s conflicts, to stand
up against this view type. I believe
views like that of Saad Raja are a
perfect microcosm of the frictions
between the western and Muslim
people.
And I quote: “This is why ‘Isoc’
must be encouraged in their efforts
to highlight humanity’s struggle
against tyranny and not bow down
tothepressuresofunqualifiedpseu-
do historians”. It should be clear to
EVERYBODY that especially in
the Middle Ages, troops from every
part of the world committed massa-
cres when conquering cities. From
historical records it is shown that
the Ottoman armies established
dictatorship in the city of Constan-
tinople; other conquests included
Pierluigi Frison continues the debate on interpretations of historical events in reply
to Saad Raja’s piece in last week’s Felix (Issue 1365)
modern Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece,
Romania, Ex-Yugoslavia, Hungary
and so on…. The Orthodox Chris-
tian church of the Holy Wisdom
(the symbol of Istanbul) was turned
into a Mosque, parts of the popu-
lation were enslaved, raped, and
murdered (it is true however that
normally invading armies did much
worse, Mehmet II however, did not
want to destroy his new capital).
Mr. Raja states that the Byzan-
tine Empire helped the crusaders
in conquering parts of the Middle
East. But I would like to stress that
the Muslim armies commanded by
Mohammed himself and his suc-
cessors conquered and completely
colonised the Christian Kingdoms
of today’s North Africa (e.g. the
Arab Republic of Egypt) and Mid-
dle East. ‘How could a prophesized
Muslim army behave in such a
manner?’
In reference to the passage about
the influx of people to the newly
conquered Constantinople, it is
common belief that many important
groups of people fled the new re-
gime, especially the educated peo-
ple. The scientists for example fled
the country to pass on their teach-
ings to the west. Many immigrated
to Italy, and with their knowledge
helped to cause the Renaissance.
The west has condemned the
Crusades, in fact the Pope has apol-
ogised for it, but not because it was
an act of unjustified imperialism,
but because it is unjust to kill peo-
ple for religious causes. We need to
be peaceful and respect each other.
Educated Muslims today have a
duty to be careful and to TEACH
respect.
European countries and espe-
To ban the veil or not to ban the
veil? That is the question that many
European nations (and British uni-
versities!) have unfortunately got
themselves bogged down tackling.
Last week I attended a much need-
ed open debate in my area of resi-
dency (East London) with regards
to this issue. Whilst there were
no famous figures in attendance,
what the discussion did have was
common folk representing a wide
spectrum of the community sharing
basic concerns. It was an event that
any multi-cultured society would be
envious of; a discussion in which
many misunderstandings, fears
and prejudices came to light to be
dispelled for good.
One old lady, for example, stood
up, faced a veiled woman and made
an honest remark that epitomised
the feelings of many in the room, “I
have lived in this area for seventy
years and the day your types turned
up I was terribly shocked... You
must really frighten kids that pass
you. How they do not turn and run a
mile I do not understand.”
However, the reality of it, as cov-
ered in the discussion, is far simpler
to understand than our fears will
have us believe. Why would an inno-
cent child, not yet subjected to the
prejudices and ill-founded beliefs
of those around it, turn and flee at
the sight of a simple black cloth? A
young child knows that underneath
the cloth is a person and people are
understood through interaction.
As the discussion of fear contin-
ued, the issue of hoodies was raised,
“Is it fair to differentiate between a
veiled woman and a hooded bandan-
naed teen?” Who better to answer
this than the local priest conven-
iently sporting a hoodie in anticipa-
tion of this topic, “If I was coming to-
wards you on the street dressed as
I am today, would fear cause you to
cross over? Not likely. What if it were
a group of veiled women? Again, not
likely.Whatifitwereagangofteens?
The reality is, unlike hooded teens,
hooded priests and veiled women
do not have a history or reputation
of street-crime and theft.” Towards
the end, a consensus began to take
shape: A society forcefully dictating
that women should not wear the veil
cannot rightfully claim to be better
than a society forcefully dictating
that woman should wear the veil.
And at this point, a comment was
thrown out, “What about that man
who has been held in prison for the
last two years because he wants to
walk around Britain naked?”
Funnily, the room silently agreed
to let the comment go without
response.
Should we fear the veil or tolerate it?
cially Britain (with the largest
Empire in the world) now con-
demn Imperialism because they
supplanted undemocratic regimes
in weaker countries and replaced
them with other undemocratic re-
gimes, leeching the raw materials
of the conquered lands. We do how-
ever; celebrate historical events
like the victory of WWII by the al-
lies. On that occasion, democratic
countries such as the US and the
UK freed Europe and Asia from the
grip of military dictatorships such
as Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan
and Fascist Italy. Those battles
brought democracy back to people
like me; and are just to celebrate. I
don’t think I would have been able
to come and study here if Italy was
still a Fascist country. Mr. Raja, do
you really think that the Ottoman
Sultanate brought freedom and
democracy to the people of Con-
stantinople? Perhaps you should
choose medieval history as a hu-
manities course here at Imperial.
I agree with Samuel Lynas, what
the Islamic society has done could
be the same as celebrating the con-
quest of India by a British Empire
society. It can be argued that this
event was a good thing; schools and
infrastructure were built and Hin-
dus and Muslims weren’t forced to
convert to Christianity. Yet we con-
demn what happened.
Last week’s article demonstrates
that aggressive Muslims are eve-
rywhere, even at the institute of
excellence that is Imperial. That
article shows that there are people
around us who don’t believe in gen-
eral morality. It is people like you,
Mr. Raja, who perhaps unknowingly
encourage terrorism worldwide.

I’m the Warden at Holbein and
Willis Jackson Halls – but rather
than just tell you about my Hall, I
thought I’d use my column space
to talk about how Halls have
changed during my time here.
I’m lucky enough to have seen
Halls from all sides: as a student,
Hall Senior (aka re-app), sub-
warden, asst. warden and finally
subwarden. Obviously Halls has
changed a great deal since I
came to university twelve years
ago, subsisting solely on Fray
Bentos pies and Stella Artois for
my first year.
Certainly the accommodation
needs of students have changed
– I started Uni at a time when
grants were still available, and
cheap accommodation was an
important factor. However, as
a warden I’m now often asked
about the availability of single
and ensuite rooms in Hall. The
focus seems to have shifted from
affordability to comfort.
Also, Hall events often used
to be ‘bargain basement’ affairs.
Hall parties were very popular,
with a vat of flat pink liquid
optimistically called punch being
served, whilst we satisfied the
requirement for fancy dress by
wrapping ourselves head-to-toe
in toilet paper. Of course it’s a
given that these events still take
place, but the diversity of our
events has increased dramati-
cally. We’re more likely now to
be organising events like a trip
to a London superclub, a day
out to Bruges or a Halal meal to
celebrate Eid. Halls culture has
benefited immensely from the
increased diversity of residents
– it’s an excellent chance to
experience other cultures.
Given that students’ needs
are always changing, wardening
teams rely on our Hall Seniors
to steer us towards what our
residents want. If your hall isn’t
organising events that appeal
to you, or you want different
facilities, make sure that you’re
letting the wardening team know
by raising it with us. We rely on
you to get things right. Better
still, get involved! The wardening
team can help you organise an
event and may even be able to
help with a subsidy….
Although Halls have changed
considerably since my arrival,
I’m pleased to say that the funda-
mentals are still the same. Halls
provide a unique community
atmosphere which I still very
much enjoy being a part of.
