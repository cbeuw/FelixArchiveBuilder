Sir Richard:
I’ll give £10k
At the first Rector’s Forum meet-
ing with the Union’s Executive, Sir
Richard revealed that he would
give £10,000 to a Centenary project
(likely to be student hardship funds
or the Beit redevelopment) at the
College if a student would run the
London marathon with the official
blessing of the College.
This surprise declaration comes
after Sir Richard snubbed Trevor
Philips, the head of the Commission
for Racial Equality (CRE) and a
former IC student, who had offered
to run for the College and donate
all money he made through spon-
sorship to the Centenary funds, on
the condition that he could run for
another charity at the same time.

The Union approached the Rector
to discuss this possibility, which
was met with a flat refusal by Sir Ri-
chard’s office. John Collins, Union
President, told Felix that the Rec-
tor believed that this would “dilute
the College’s brand”.
At the Rector’s forum on Wednes-
day, the issue was raised by the
members of the Executive. Sir Ri-
chard, appearing to be somewhat
frustrated with the matter, made
the generous offer when it pointed
out that a lone student running for
the College would never be able
to make the same amount of mon-
ey from sponsorship that Trevor
Philips could, simply saying: “I’ll
give them £10,000, then.”
There are three Centenary
projects currently under consid-
eration for receiving money during
IC’s funding drive to celebrate the
100th anniversary of the founding of
the College. These are the Central
Library redevelopment, student
hardship funds, and the Beit mas-
terplan (for redeveloping the Un-
ion buildings). It seems likely that
the money from the Rector will be
funneled into the student hardship
funds.
The Rector’s first forum with the
Executive also led Sir Richard to
make one of his trademark outspo-
ken statements; in this case, it con-
cerned the possibility of removing
the cap on top-up fees. Sir Richard
spoke strongly against it, saying:
“You can’t take the cap off, that’s an
absolute nonsense. You can’t allow
145 institutions to charge what they
like, that would be a disaster.”
Sir Richard proposed a different
funding model, arguing as he has
done many times in the past that
the most able students should have
a chance to attend well-funded
‘elite’ universities, saying that a
student achieving good grades and
gaining a place at a top university
should trigger full funding for that
student’s education – he called this
“a damn good investment”. Sir Ri-
chard focussed on the funding situ-
ation for the top universities, imply-
ing the development of a multi-tier
system of higher education that al-
ready exists in some countries.
With the debate about top-up
fees due to be reignited, and with
the recent affiliation referendum
meaning the Union will be joining
the NUS whose policy on top-up
fees has moved to being against
removal of the cap rather than the
abolition of fees, students may find
it reassuring that Sir Richard ap-
pears to be on their side.
Discussing police
tactics post-7/7
The Union’s Chaplaincy arranged a meeting between members of
the Metropolitan Police, the Police Authority and representatives
from the Muslim community. The police were interested in being
able to hear the views of students on the policing of London in
the wake of the Tube bombings last July. Also present was Musa
Admani, Imam of London Metropolitan University, who revealed
on Newsnight last month that he had been threatened with death
by an ‘Islamic death squad’ from Imperial College.
