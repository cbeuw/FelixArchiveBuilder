Imperial College could soon
develop a green tinge to its fin-
gers, as it has been revealed that
it is contemplating merging with
Wye College. The agricultural col-
lege, incorporating 8 5 0 students, is
currently a m e m b e r of the
University of London but can no
longer maintain its a u t o n o m o u s
status, and might have to affiliate
with a larger institute.
W y e College consists of a 350
hectare area of farmland near
Ashford in Kent, and concentrates
its research in the fields of live-
stock, horticulture and crop cultiva-
tion. In recent years it has collabo-
rated with IC and other research
centres on environmental projects.
Canterbury University has been
considering a merger with W y e
College, leading to the IC governing
board submitting a preliminary 'no
prejudice' offer that will be pro-
posed to Wye's Governors on 20
M a r c h . A positive response to the
offer will initiate a period of consul-
tation to discuss the terms and
conditions of the merger, it is
thought that a merger with W y e
College w o u l d work in a similar
fashion to the current set-up with
Silwood Park, a research station in
Berkshire that is part of Imperial
College, but runs its o w n adminis-
tration.
The ICU President, A n d y
Heeps, and his two deputies are
already making plans for a visit to
the W y e Union in order to acquaint
themselves with the institute.
Although proceedings are at an
early stage Andy Heeps is already
constructing a strict format for his
role in the merger, which he is
determined to abide by. He stated
"1 hope very m u c h to have firm
details before I leave office" and is
adamant that "the pantomime that
w a s the medical school merge
won't happen again." M r Heeps
saw the possible merger as
"ground-breaking for agriculture"
but went o n to say that from a cyn-
ical v i e w p o i n t the real reason
behind IC's offer could be that
"environmental and agriculture is an
area of growth and likely to bring in
a lot of research."
M i c k Selby, Union President at
W y e College, has a favourable out-
look o n the opportunities a merger
could provide, predicting that "the
student body w o u l d grow", and
that there w o u l d be "more life for
the students having a connection
with Imperial." H o w e v e r , he
claimed that as yet the college had
"kept the union in the dark".
Currently talks between the col-
leges are informal, and any affilia-
tion could not be installed before
2 0 0 0 . As Imperial attempts to
increase its influence, Andy Heeps
flippantly c o m m e n t e d "it seems IC
want to take over the world."
IC Medics' Win Pitch Battle
ANDY KING
This year St Mary's and Charing
Cross rugby clubs have combined
to form a joint team; Imperial
Medics RFC. Results throughout
the season have been excellent
and so expectations were high for
a victory in the United Hospitals
Cup Final against United
Medical and Dental
Schools.
The match was held at
O l d Deer Park in
Richmond with 1500
spectators in attendance.
Tension between the
opposing fans was high,
with s o m e particularly
impressive banners and
cheerleaders o n display
from the Imperial Medics'
supporters.
The first half saw
U M D S applying sustained
pressure on the Imperial
Medics, winning the terri-
torial advantage. A combination of
poor use of possession and excellent
counter attacking from the Imperial
backs, however, meant that the first
half finished with Imperial M e d i c s
leading by fourteen points to nil, the
result of a penalty try and a try from
back row forward Oli Waters, both
converted by Louis Grandjean.
Confidence was high amongst
the IMRFC supporters as the second
half began. Through better use of the
ball, however, U M D S were winning

in the forwards, managing to score
two trys and equal at seventeen all.
Their fly half then kicked an excellent
drop goal to take them into the lead.
It looked as if Imperial Medics were
going to miss out, but then a superb
breakaway resulted in us being
awarded a penalty in the last min-
utes of the match. M a n y supporters
could not watch as Louis again
stepped up to take the kick, and with
a cool head hit it over the bar and
the match was tied at twenty points
all.

ers seemed to suffer
