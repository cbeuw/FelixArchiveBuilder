L
ast Friday gave us yet anoth-
er chance to see some of the
best bands that IC has to
offer. In fact this was the best gig
so far this year, the event really
benefiting from being o n a Friday,
instead of the usual Thursday, with
more people watching and a m u c h
better atmosphere, resulting in all
of the bands giving excellent per-
formances.
First up were 'Snapdragon' w h o
started off the evening with a bang
playing a very tight and polished
set consisting of an eclectic choice
of covers by bands such as Pearl
Jam, Metallica and Blur. The tight
rhythm section, especially John's
rock solid bass playing, allowed the
guitarists to play at their best. This
is a band rapidly gaining a reputa-
tion at college, and rightly so
though it would be nice to hear
some original songs at their next
gig. Anyway, this got the ever
increasing crowd into the m o o d as
we w e l c o m e d the next band and 1
w e l c o m e d another 3 pints of
Guinness....
You've probably never heard of
'Canvas', but they are actually what
was formerly known as 'Funk and
Disorderly', one of the most well
known and impressive bands in
college. Their excellently per-
formed set of acid jazz songs went
d o w n very well with the now rather
large m o b gathered in Db's and
provided a nice contrast to the pre-
vious band. The playing was top-
class with some inspired solos, in
particular from the alluringly attired
A m y Barnes (nice dress!) on saxo-
phone. Anyway, another band and
another few beers. W e now had the
tantalising prospect of ' P . O . G . ' and
their unique brand of funk-rock. A
sort of drugged up, bastardised
hybrid of the last 2 bands (in the
nicest possible sense, of course),
' P . O . G . ' rocked the socks off of the
now scarily large crowd whilst giv-
ing them sleepless nights wonder-
ing why the bassist, Mark, kept
changing hats for every song. This
was an excellent set with some sur-
prisingly g o o d original songs mixed
in with covers like Foxy Lady.
With a final
stumble to the
bar for beers 10
- 12, I made it
back in time to
sample the
delights of
'Cereal Killer'
w h o are n o w
regarded as
(probably) the
best band in
college at th§
m o m e n t . They
rose to the
challenge with a
rocking, near
flawless set of covers and original
songs, living up to their acclaimed
reputation with the practiced ease
we've come to expect. In fact they
were so g o o d 1 nearly d r o p p e d my
beer - only nearly, mind... M y only
gripe is that they need a little more
diversity in their songs to show off
their talents even more. However,
their excellent performance was
certainly appreciated by the c r o w d
and brought a very enjoyable
evening to an end.
I'd certainly recommend these
band nights to anyone as the stan-
dard of the bands is always very
high and it doesn't cost anything to
see them. It was a shame the
bands didn't have time to play
longer sets and I got the impres-
sion that the bands had only really
just warmed up by the end of their
set. Congratulations to everyone
involved for an excellent evening.
As for the rest of y o u , c o m e along
next time and be pleasantly sur-
prised - y o u don't k n o w what
you're missing! EJ

Cereal Killer - as good as a bowl

I
talian 70's p o m movie sound-
tracks... heard it all before, eh?
Erm, actually, no. As themed
albums go, it would be hard to pin-
point the original concept for this
record from its content unless you
pick up on occasional background
m o a n i n g . Individual tracks are
more reminiscent of Westerns
(Space Devils) or c o m e d y cartoon
capers (Sequence Six) than tight
trousers and dodgy 'tashes. The
confusion is not even due to my
misunderstanding the lyrics; only a
couple of the tunes feature any
vocals and I dare say that that
orchestral numbers with names
like No Parting and Klu Klux Clan
Sequence will probably not drive
listeners into any kind of sexual
frenzy. Loosely, the record is jazz.
The range, however, is vast: from
sleepy, chilled panpipes to crazed,
energetic sitar and H a m m o n d
solos. The accent is certainly on
slower, slinky tunes that are inter-
esting enough without ever being
totally gripping. They may induce a
vague tapping of the foot, which I
suppose (as a soundtrack), is their
purpose. O n reflection, the record
would probably work well under a
film, although the genre is certain-
ly surprising, although it does not
work so well at home on a stereo.
Surely there are more original
and interesting easy listening
tracks out there. Soundtracks gen-
erally feature music made for the
sake of a film, not for music's sake:
in my book this is definitely a bad
thing. Lyrics along the lines of 'Laa-
la-la' may entertain Eurovision and
classic erotica fans, but they are
unlikely to ever change your life.
