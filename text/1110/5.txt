READ THIS N O W
The Summer Ball, So What's it all
about then ?
Hopefully you will have noticed
that the Imperial College Summer
Ball is happening this year, but
where did it c o m e from and what
does it actually mean?
The whole thing came about
because we wanted to celebrate
the end of the year with style but,
unlike just about every other
University, Imperial didn't have a
Summer Ball. Imperial is a presti-
gious University and yet there is no
prestigious event to reflect our sta-
tus. W e thought we'd do some-
thing about it.
A lot of people have said that
the event seems very expensive,
and w e admit that £ 4 5 isn't cheap,
but we would like to explain what
people will be getting for their
money. The cost per head to run
the event is around £ 8 0 (without
making any profit), the difference
being met through subsidy and
sponsorship. It may help to bear in
mind that a typical Oxford M a y Ball
this year will cost around £ 7 5 per
ticket. The ticket price will include a
three-course meal, drinks, a live
band, a casino, travel to and from
the event all t o p p e d off with a styl-
ish range of high-calibre entertain-
ment.
Another misconception is the
scale of the event. Alexandra
Palace is a huge venue - we have a
capacity of two thousand people
(although w e are expecting nearer
a thousand). This will be unlike any
other event you will have seen at
Imperial.
It's also worth noting that the
event is open to everyone - stu-
dents (undergrads and postgrads),
staff and Alumni of Imperial as well
as their guests. W e want it to be
representative of all members of
Imperial and we would really like to
see people from all corners of the
globe turning up in their countries
formal dress.
You may wonder why we have
gone to the trouble of organising
the event. M o s t of us on the team
already have jobs, so we're not just
doing it for CV points. W e are
doing it because we want to go to
a ball - a night we will remember
for the rest of our lives.
This is the first event of it's kind
and you have an opportunity to be
part of it. If it's a success then it will
b e c o m e part of Imperial's heritage
and it will be thanks to you that it
happened. Tickets will be available
soon from the Union Office, we
hope to see you there.

SETHI RULES
Dear Felix,
just to let you know I found a
r o o m at the toilet end of the
southside bar (literally the toilet
end for those of y o u w h o think this
is a vague indication of it's location)
last Thursday. Anyhow, it turned
out to be the imaginativley named
Southside Disco and through what
1 gathered was mostly the efforts of
DJ AI;ck Sethi it was transformed in
to the coolest , most laid back
atmosplace in the college for chill-
ing after spending a hard portion
of the week being a student. If your
idea of relaxing involves cool tunes
and space then y o u could d o a lot
worse than checking this venue
out. IC radio can only be encour-
aged to promote this venue and
maybe spend some cash on decor.
Respect to Al;cks' Electric Cafe
for showing what can be achieved
with the college facillities if you're
prepared to get of your arse and
do something and for giving us a
real treat. Hopefully the Electric
Cafe will b e c o m e a fortnightly
event and if you can spin some
vinyl get in touch with IC radio to
get a slot

'Sup Felix!
First up, N O - O N E disses my
shorty, Milen, and Dave, if 1 ever

l i s t e n i n ' - s o r r y - l o o k i n ' - t i r e d - a s s -
narrow BEHIND, I'ma blow your
brains out muthafucka and y o u
best believe it, brutha, w o r d is
bond!
Now, if y o u actually believed a
word of what I just said, you're an
even bigger twat than I thought you
were and for thinking that all the -
isms in Tha Bomb are for real.
SAO BUSINESS
Dear Editor
I refer to two recent letters
(Felix 1 106 and 1109) from stu-
dents complaining about treatment
received in the a c c o m m o d a t i o n
office. Imperial College tries very
hard to d o a g o o d job in accom-
modation and, in my experience,
usually succeeds. Inevitably, how-
ever, things sometimes go wrong
and there perhaps remain ways
their operation can improve.
The college Residences
M a n a g e m e n t is very keen to get to
the bottom of this business. If the
students w h o wrote are in a Hall of
Residence, they should go to their
Warden and discuss the complaint.
If not, I'd invite them to contact
me and allow me (in confidence if
necessary) to see if we can sort the
problem out.
I'm contactable on
j .hassard@ic .ac.uk.
regards
John Hassard
Warden Selkirk and Tizard Hall
WHY O H WHY?
Dear Sir,
W e are indeed deeply hon-
oured to become aligned with such
luminaries as College Catering, the
Labour Party and the European
C o m m i s s i o n by having been
moaned at by Simon Baker in his
column for you esteemed organ.
Yours faithfully,
Martin Frost (RCSU Publicity

James S Farrer (RCSU Publicity

Congratulations, publicity offi-
cers. You have suceeded in publi-
cising the fact that you are a pair
of petty, sarcastic, self-impor-
tant, sad little men. If you spent
a little more time doing your job
instead of fluffing up your own
feathers, perhaps you wouldn't
have been criticised in the first
place. Frankly, if I was writing the
column, I would have written the
same thing. Now go away.
Deadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for
length, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.
Letters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe
card when submitting them.
