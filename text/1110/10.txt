Schadenfreude is in abun-
dance in ICU at the
moment. Not unsurprisingly, the
Union must have collectively
smiled w h e n they heard of
Waterstone's p r e d i c a m e n t . It
would seem that not enough peo-
ple are buying their b o o k s .
Naturally, Waterstone's are not too
pleased about missing their targets
by, if the rumours are true, 30%.
This must be dealt with, but
expanding into stationery is a non-
starter on two fronts. Firstly, as
suggested in Felix last week,
College should put a stop to this.
The lease, in a departure from
usual College procedure, is water-
tight- section 5.9.1 says that they
may sell books, tapes, journals and
suchlike and 'no other merchan-
dise.' Interestingly, they are per-
mitted to sell 'academic software',
so my advice is to screw over the
College C o m p u t e r S h o p , rather
than the Union. It goes on to say,
in section 5.9.3, that the shop may
not be used 'for any illegal or
immoral act, nor as a club, betting
shop [or] sex shop.' So despite the
enormous potential market, an IC
knocking shop is not on the cards.
Secondly, diversifying the product
range could merely exacerbate the
problem. Though we all know that
Waterstone's are here, few of us
know exactly what's going on at
any particular time. Special offers
are not promoted beyond a sign in
the w i n d o w . They should be
advertising offers and new editions
every week in Felix, for instance.
Their current problems d o not
need the likes
of Sir John
Harvey-Jones to
solve. This is
easy to fix, and
does not
require 'nui-
sance or annoy-
ance' to the
Union, which as
part of Imperial,
is banned under
section 5.9.2.
Stop w h i n g i n g
and start man-
aging, ladies and gentlemen.
O n e story that seems to rum-
ble on in the background is the
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office incident
with C. Chan. Despite one intem-
perate letter from a warden- not
terribly effective to bemoan 'public
slanging' in a letter where you label
the complainant a racist, Clive-

official support for the Office has
been conspicuous by its absence.
Like Clive Wells, I d o not know the
details, but I must say my treat-
ment there has always been pass-
able, though not worthy of any
customer service awards. The
whole saga does raise one point
that really annoys me, namely the
you don't hear
the abuse that
our staff have to
endure' excuse,
tendered every
time anyone
moans about
poor service or
truculent staff.
This s e e m s
predicated o n
the belief that IC
students are all
n e a n d e r t h a l
thugs, whereas
everyone else in the country
behaves impeccably. The fact is
that the world is full of rude cus-
tomers, w h o must be treated cour-
teously by staff, however difficult
that may be. Staff in shops or
restaurants have to deal with peo-
ple w h o are far more unpleasant
than the inmates here, and must
do so without resorting to fighting
fire with fire. This is called profes-
sionalism. The problem here is not
so m u c h the staff, many of w h o m
are very g o o d , but the system. The
system does not acknowledge that
w e are customers. C o m m e r c i a l
activities at Imperial need to be
more customer-focussed, to use
that horrible Americanism. If man-
agement instil this belief into their
staff, things will change. Being nice
to people is not something that
most of us d o automatically, as
you realise from reading this col-
umn, and if we can avoid it, we
will. If w e are told that we must be
nice, we generally are. In fact, a lit-
tle more professionalism through-
out this place would go a long
way.
Finally, a cautionary note for
mobile p h o n e users. Cloning,
which can be very expensive and
inconvenient, may be something
you think only happens to other
people fare more careless than
you. N o t so, for even our watchful
Head of Security, Keith Reynolds,
has fallen victim to this crime,
c o s t i n g the College Â£ 5 0 0 last
Sunday. If it can happen to him,
can the world sleep easily at night?
"All political careers end in failure,"
the recently deceased Enoch Powell
once said bitterly, when he was fired
from the Shadow Cabinet by Edward
Heath after his infamous speech
warning of rivers of blood if more
immigrants were permitted into
Britain. In the Conservative Party
right now, certain recently trampled
on careers are beginning to rehabili-
tate themselves despite accrued
political w i s d o m , and for the right
reasons. During the Conservative
leadership election, A n n
W i d d e c o m b e t o r p e d o e d M i c h a e l
Howard's chances of gaining the
leadership with an attack on his per-
formance as H o m e Secretary. At
issue was Howard's handling of the
sacking of the Prisons Service
Director-General, Derek Lewis. This
fracas had been ignited with the
escape of three convicted murder-
ers from a maximum security prison
on the Isle of Wight (which was then
downgraded to Category B). The
governor of the prison was fired,
with Michael Howard announcing it
to backbench Tory cheers. Later the
Director-General himself was sacked
by Howard and then immediately
took action against the H o m e Office
for unfair dismissal. His argument
was that Howard had interfered with
the Director-General's job of actual-
ly running the prisons rather than
keep to his proper role of legislating
and setting policy. There was a
famous Newsnight interview in the
wake of the sacking where Jeremy
Paxman repeatedly asked "did you
threaten to overrule him?" to
Howard w h o repeatedly dodged the
question, making it painfully obvious
what the truth was and a spectacle
for anyone not to keen on Howard.
Under Howard at the time was
M i c h a e l H o w a r d ' s chances. Her
phrase that "there is something of
the night about him" sparked a c o m -
ical row, with Howard retaliating
that she had deep affection for
Derek Lewis, and that flowers had
been exchanged. This precipitated
her public assertion of her o w n vir-
ginity. The whole episode had infuri-
ated Widdecombe, w h o had never
liked the fact that Howard fired the
Director-General of the service for
Hamish Common
Westminster
Eye
Ann Widdecombe, who as Prisons
Minister, earned the hatred of the
Left for insisting that expectant
mothers should be handcuffed to
the bed right up until the birth
process started. Ann is also against
sex before marriage, and quite pub-
lic about her virginity - she said "if
anyone says I am not a virgin, I'll
sue." When one considers her forth-
rightness over such sensitive issues,
perhaps it was not so surprising that
she was happy to publicly finish off
which she had responsibility.
The plot thickened in the last
few days, when it became clear that
Widdecombe was being considered
for a Shadow Cabinet post. Michael
Howard, now the Shadow Foreign
Secretary, announced that he had
forgiven her for destroying his lead-
ership chances, further infuriating
Widdecombe, w h o said that just the
previous week he had cut her dead
"in front of witnesses", and a source
close to her saying "this is ridiculous.
She has never exchanged two words
with Michael since last year. There
has been no make-up, no apology.
He is re-writing history. He is trying
to make it look as though Ann is
admitting she got it wrong and she
had apologised." Publicly, though,
they are best of friends: "Ann is
being particularly effective in oppos-
ing this Government", Howard said
recently. This is true: she makes reg-
ular appearances on television, is
close to finishing her novel, and her
attacks on Blairism earned her the
(probably complimentary) nickname
of "U-boat Widdecombe". This has
won her the approval of Tory M P s
and ironically many on the Labour
benches w h o like her directness and
independence, reminding them of
the days before Labour's Millbank
mind machine.
It is refreshing to see that direct-
ness and bravery are still cherished
values in politics, and that Howard's
sliminess in office was eventually
punished. M i s s W i d d e c o m b e is
making a remarkable political come-
back if does achieve Shadow
Cabinet status, and this will be
undoubtedly despite of, rather than
because of Michael Howard. It
would be nice to see the honest
defeat the deceitful in politics once
in a while.
