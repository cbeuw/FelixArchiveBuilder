CCUs - Nobody
Cares: It's Official
DAVID ROBERTS
This week's executive elections
for both the City & Guilds Union
and the Royal College of Science
Union were marred by extremely
low turnouts. Although a full c o m -
pliment of officers for 1998-9 have
n o w been elected for b o t h
Constituent College U n i o n s , a
turnout of below 5% in each elec-
tion - just half of last year's figures
- raises questions concerning both
the election procedure and the
perceived relevance of the C C U s to
IC students.
In the RCSU elections, Katy
Nolan was returned as President,
with a comfortable 9 8 to 4 5 victo-
ry over N e w Election. Bob Walker
and Douglas Graham also secured
easy wins over N e w Election, as
Vice Presidents for Clubs & Events
and Education £v Welfare respec-
tively. In the only contested elec-
tion, that for Vice President
(Finance), Simon Torn squeezed
through by a tiny margin of just 3
votes over William Bently on the
second reallocation of votes.
In C&.GU, H a m i s h C o m m o n
w o n through by 127 to 17 over the
ever-present N e w Election chal-
lenge. A s a result of the recent res-
ignation of the sitting Guilds
President, M r C o m m o n will take
over i m m e d i a t e l y as C & G
President, picking up the reigns
from Acting-President Alex Tylee
Birdsall. Elsewhere Jeevan Manala,
Selina Vinayaga-Pavan and John
Quantrell all emerged victorious, as
Vice President, Honorary Secretary
a n d H o n o r a r y junior Treasurer
respectively. The Guilds Executive
for 1998-9 is completed by Pete
Burge, returned as C&.G
A s s o c i a t i o n Representative. All
posts were contested by just one
candidate.
The low turnout is a source of
deep concern within both Unions,
although no-one is prepared to
point the finger of blame. A n analy-
sis of the figures shows just h o w
deeply the problem runs; for exam-
ple, a meagre three voters turned
out in Civil Engineering (out of 500
students), and just nineteen votes
were required to secure victory in
the Physics Department Represen-
tative election f r o m over 8 0 0
potential pollers.
Student Mugged near
Science Museum
ED SEXTON & JON TROUT
A student of Imperial College
was mugged last Sunday night.
The student w a s w a l k i n g u p
Exhibition Road at around m i d -
night, on his way to Southside
Halls, w h e n he was s t o p p e d by
three m e n near the Science
M u s e u m . The m e n threatened the
student with violence a n d pro-
duced a knife, forcing him to hand
over ten pounds, his credit and
switch cards. They then squirted
some liquid of unknown c o m p o s i -
tion into his face, before running
off.
The student immediately went
to college security, w h o informed
the police of the incident. Security
and the police searched for the
men, using dogs to help in the
tracking process. They were unsuc-
cessful however, and the men are
still at large. The student was taken
to hospital, but fortunately is
believed to have suffered no per-
manent damage.
Ken Weir, Chief Security
Officer, did not think that the men
were targeting students in particu-
lar. H e believed that the attack
was a random incident, based on
o p p o r t u n i s m . H e d i d however
warn students to stay alert when
out at night, and not to display
cash or valuables w h e n in the
street. H e also advised students
not to travel ak>ne at night. Any
students wanting further advice
can contact security, w h o have
produced a leaflet concerning the
issue.
News in Brief...
DERMOT
MORGAN R.I.P
The sudden death of c o m i c actor
Dermot M o r g a n , made famous in
Britain by Channel Four's Father
Ted, came only one day after he
finished filming the third series of
the highly popular show. Whilst
holding a dinner party at his
London h o m e last Saturday night,
M o r g a n collapsed to the floor
with a suspected heart attack and
was rushed to a nearby hospital,
where he died shortly afterwards.
Friends have c o m m e n t e d that the
star burned himself out, ironically
just w h e n he w a s starting to
receive the critical acclaim for
which he had striven so hard. His
early career was more than tinged
with controversy; his highly satiri-
cal radio series Scrap Saturday
(1990-92) was a p h e n o m e n o n
which became required listening
for the Irish public, with the s h o w
even being quoted into the record
of the Irish Parliament. RTE, the
Irish Broadcaster, pulled the show
at the height of its popularity after
political arm twisting; they
refused also to show Father Ted, a
surreal yet insightful journey into
religion, citing the show's anti-
Irishness a n d its m o c k e r y of
Catholicism as reasons. Rapidly
gaining a cult following o n both
sides of the Irish Sea, Father Ted
will bow out permanently at the
end of the new series. Dermot
M o r g a n was a great comedian; in
the m o u l d of Bill H i c k s he
e s c h e w e d the establishment,
clawed it d o w n and rose above it.
An irreplaceable talent, be sure to
see him in his final work at his
dazzling best.
ULU ELECTIONS
Unbeknownst to most Imperial
students, elections for the sabbat-
ical positions in the University of
London Union are taking place
this month. Unlike the recent sab-
batical elections at IC, voting is
not open to all U L U students, as
this w o u l d involve the unfeasible
processing of around 100,000
votes. Instead the positions will
be elected by approximately sev-
enty delegates to U L U Council on
the evening of 16 M a r c h .
Rob Clark, currently Deputy
President (Finance and Services)
for I C U , is standing for Vice
President (Finance and Societies)
at the elections. H e is the only
candidate running for the posi-
tion, and as U L U Council tradi-
tionally avoids voting for N e w
Election, his chances are felt to be
g o o d .
Nick Dunnett, a Royal
Holloway student, is running for
Vice President (Sports). His candi-
dature has caused controversy:
Charlie Joynt, currently ICU
D e p u t y President (Clubs and
Societies), w a s particularly
scathing in his assessment of M r
Dunnett's chances, denouncing
him as "shit" and asking "where
did this guy c o m e from?"
The other posts being con-
tested are President, Vice
President (Welfare and Student
Affairs), a n d L o n d o n Student
Editor.
LORDS DELAY
FEES
The Secretary of State for
Education, David Blunkett M P ,
v o w e d this week to overturn the
G o v e r n m e n t ' s defeat in the
H o u s e of Lords over its Teaching
and Higher Education bill. The bill,
based o n the Dearing Report,
would require students to pay
tuition fees of around £ 1 0 0 0 a
year. The Conservative a m e n d -
ment to freeze grants at current
levels was passed by 143 votes to
102. A second amendment, also
proposed by the Conservatives,
which w o u l d guarantee U K stu-
dents at Scottish universities their
funding for the full term of their
degrees was also passed. Blunkett
c o n d e m n e d the Lords' decision,
announcing that Labour w o u l d
overturn it in the H o u s e of
C o m m o n s in time for the next
academic year. Andy Heeps, ICU
President, d e n o u n c e d the bill as
"the thin end of the wedge -
where will it stop?". Citing the
example of the student loans sys-
tem he a d d e d ; "What is really sad
that people will act like sheep and
pay up without a fuss."
