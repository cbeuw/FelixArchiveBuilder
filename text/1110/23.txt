No 1110: Cleaning Windows
Recent puzzles have been a bit
fiendish. Apologies to anyone
who got into a fight / broke u p
with their best friend / c o m m i t t e d
murder while arguing about the
solutions. In the interests of san-
ity, here's a nice simple o n e for
you all this week:
A w i n d o w cleaner, let's call
him Roy, is trying to clean the
first-floor panes at the back of
ones of those o l d Victorian ter-
races with the coal bunkers. The
bunker is built straight onto the
back of the house and has a sim-
ple square section, measuring
2 m high by 1.5m deep. Roy's
ladder is six metres long, a n d for
security he wants it to touch the
corner of the bunker as well as
the floor and the wall. The ques-
tion is:
How far up the wall will the
ladder reach?
Easy, eh?
The solution to puzzle 1 107 (Game Show Puzzler) is always
change your selection as it doubles your chances of winning.
Correct answers were received from Aveesh Acharya, David
French, Nathan Borgeaud, Darren Hubbard, Vaskor Basak, and
of course Barry Gale. They all receive an imaginary lolly-pop.
Mail or e-mail your answers to the Felix office (felix@ic.ac.uk). If you
are correct, your name will be printed in a blaze of glory next week.
