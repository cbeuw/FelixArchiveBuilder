CLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW
QUANTUM MECHANICS ALBUM LAUNCH PARTY
THE END, WEST CENTRAL STREET, WC1
R
enegade Hardware are one
of the labels you just c o u l d -
n't ignore last year, a sub-
sidiary of t h e well established
Trouble-on-Vinyl label. Quantum
Mechanics is a compilation featur-
ing some of the rising stars in D & B
and will get a full album review in
weeks to c o m e (when I finally get a
copy).
The End was chosen to host the
launch party and I can see w h y as it
has to be one of the best venues in
the city. I have been here before
about a year ago and was blown
away by the A I sound-system (I
doubt you'll find a better sounding
system in London for clarity and
power) and the clean ' n ' new feel-
ing this club still has even though
it's been open a few years now.
Respect to M r . C (of Shamen fame)
and crew for making this one of the
T H E A L B U M I A U N C H
Q U A N T U M
? 77;; ,
most happening clubs in town.
W e arrived at about 1 1.00pm.
and the guest list queue was longer
than the paying, everyone wanted
to be at this one and after a little
wait w e
were in.

full and Future Forces were giving
the crowd a g o o d work-out. After
battling to the one and only bar in
the place, (the only grumble I have)
we headed for the dance floor. It
looked packed but we easily found
space to stand back and take in the
phat beats and surprisingly friendly
'n' relaxed atmosphere, with t h e
sweet smell of skunk thick in t h e
air.
The main r o o m was obviously
«S»T C I N T R A I ar WC1
dropping the freshest slabs of D & B
you'll hear anywhere, m u c h o f
which 1 should imagine taken from
the forthcoming album. The second
room I only went into t o buy the

h o w ruff it
was in the
m a i n
room) was playing house /garage
/disco sort of thing going on.
Next u p o n t h e decks w a s
Bailey, w h o total rinsed out t h e
place. I hardly stopped jacking and
busting for the whole two hours or
so that he was on. A n d y o u should
have seen t h e c r o w d w h e n he
dropped Warhead, a little old but
already a classic. Easily the DJ of
the night for us and everyone else
from where I was standing, playing
a diverse mix of D&B as did all the
DJs. A broad spectrum of styles
were covered which made for a
nice change.
At this point 1 must give props
to the lighting engineer w h o nor-
mally don't get a mention, but at
least I appreciated the thought that
planning that went into the lighting.
A n d with respect to the sound sys-
tem; it hasn't lost any of it's edge
since last time I was here and it just
kept getting louder and louder, t o
the point where the speakers we
were standing next t o were nearly
jumping up ' n ' d o w n . Speakers that
big don't normal move but these
were vibrating s o much that beer
bottles were flying off 'em.
So I can highly r e c o m m e n d this
club to y o u all and I sign off giving
full respect t o DJ Bailey w h o made
my night at least. Jo Public

WAX DOCTOR
SELECTED WORKS (R&S Recordings)
T
he latest album from Paul
Sanders (The W a x Doctor) is
imaginatively titled Selected
Works. Yes, you've guessed it, a n
hour-long c o m p i l a t i o n o f Paul's
intelligent style of d ' n ' b releases
from t h e past g o d - k n o w s - h o w -
many years.
For those of you w h o don't
know of the man, it's safe t o say
that he has been one of the leading
figures in m a k i n g t o d a y ' s D & B
music what it is, and this album
highlights some of his most influen-
tial pieces of work.
CLUBSCENE - SINGLES
Eight tracks have been selected,
and are aimed t o give a 'journey
like' feel, also having the aura of a
chill out C D . However, the album
still manages t o deliver more than
most in this genre can, and it's hard
to believe how old some of these
tracks are as you could play them
out today 'n' most wouldn't notice.
The first tune, Atmospheric
Funk (which originally appeared on
Talkin' Loud label) is one of the
funkiest tracks of all time, and is
probably the best example of how
the d ' n ' b scene emerged from the
sounds of the early nineties. A fast,
gliding beat t o very intelligent
breakdowns make for an intriguing
10 minutes.
Although t h e a l b u m is n o t
mixed, All I Need caries on in the
same vein with a very laid back
funky style. The third track. Step,
takes on the darker side of things,
and could have been p r o d u c e d
straight out of either the O l d Skool
era, or from the 'Reprazent' style
nowadays.
Spectrum is one of the earliest
produced tracks o n the compila-
tion. It's vocals, produced superbly
alongside the bassline, is a typical
e x a m p l e o f t h e techno/ jungle
fusion often found in early tracks.
Kid Caprice, a Metalheadz release,
along with Heaf a n d Offshore Drift
following in the same blueprint as
the earlier tracks.
All in all, the eight tracks c o m -
bine to make this more of a d ' n ' b
listening album. Although o f it's
type, it's probably one of the best -
but things have m o v e d on
E E Chris.
Just a little note about the singles featured in the clubscene section, firstly they are mainly vinyl only release, and secondly you will not
find most of these tracks in the large record shops e.g. HMV etc, but small independent record shops such as Blackmarket Rec. or Section 5.
GARAGE
Chris Mack. Feel Good/Alright.
(Main Ingredient) Out Now.
For some reason the sleeve of this
record with "Spicing up the under-
ground" written o n it made m e
think it would be cheesy as y o u
like. But that preconception was
quickly dismissed and appearances
can be deceiving. It gets straight
down t o business with a broken
beat style, looped vocal and stabs
of acid sounds. Then rolls in a deep
sub-bass s o ya can wind ya waist.
Powerful female title vocal a n d
clever cut ' n ' spliced beats keep
you interested. O n e for the dance-
floor massive.
2 Deep EP. Get Away/ Loving You.
(Ripe 'n' Ready) Out Now.
O f the three mixes of Get Away,
the original does it for me, with it's
jiggerly beats, building keys and
looped male vocal. Then the phat
sub-bass c o m e s into play mixing it
up and alternating with the key-
board stabs 'n' beats and looped
title vocal. This all fits together very
well with a variety of combinations
of t h e above mentioned beats.
Also a nice Loving you is easy remix
on here as well, it's been given the
two step sort of treatment, with an
extended vocal from the original,
not a floor burner but works well.
TECH/HOUSE
Freaky Charka. Year 2000 EP.
(Astralworks) Mid March.
This c o m e s from San Francisco's
Daum Bentley and introduces us,
well me anyway, to the tech-house
styles bubbling u p from S a n
Francisco's underground. This EP is
geared more towards the dance-
floor and I can see why, with it's
body-rocking slow stepping beats
working hand in hand with a simple
b-line, eerie atmosphericals and
intelligent programing which make
for four very useable tracks.
Showing me yet another dimension
of house music.
Egoiste. Wind It Up.
(Truelove) 2nd March.
In that banging house style, fast
stomping beats, tight percussion,
nice trippy atmosphericals. All bro-
ken up nicely with little breaks of
this & that, and when you think it's
broken d o w n t o c o m e back
stronger for the last time, it goes
and does it again and again!
Jon's mix is darker and more mini-
mal, but retains a certain depth.
With clever use of horns all filtered
and fucked with, and a very large
breakdown in the middle.
E E Jo Pubilc.
