DREDGE
Years of Violation No Stars
T
ake some mindless, repeti-
tive lyrics, and mix well with
overpowering, head-banging
drum beats. A d d a pinch of Pain,
preferably from the House of, and
a well g r o u n d Red H o t Chilli
Pepper. Leave to stew for approxi-
mately four minutes in a Metallica
bowl. Serve with generous helpings
of anything that clashes, grates or
disturbs - et voila, y o u have
Dredge.
Heavy metal is really not m y
scene at the best of times, and this
definitely is not the best of times.
What satisfaction anyone c o u l d
possibly draw from this is beyond
my comprehension. Every track is
the same, just with a different mes-
sage to shout about. I say 'mes-
sage' but do not for one second
think that I a m crediting them with
having created an album to make a
difference. The only difference I felt
was my vocal cords straining out of
sympathy for theirs. During the rare
breaks in the yelling, the realisation
of this talentless group is blatant.
The endless bellowing and the
drowning-out by drums is simply a
cover for the fact that they couldn't
hit a correct note were it a barn
door.
The comparisons made above
with Red Hot Chilli Peppers, House
of Pain and Metallica are not in any
way recognition for Dredge, they
are simply examples of w h o they
have tried to rip off. In fact, they
are more akin to a dire Rage
Against The Machine.
1 had not heard of Dredge
before now, and 1 hope never to
hear of them again. This would get
minus stars were they available to
give.
However, one g o o d thing did
c o m e from this; the thickness of a
C D is the perfect size to stabilise
my wobbling desk - no more w o b -
ble, bliss. ESI

SIZZLA
Praise ye jah
S
izzla's second album is like a
stick of rock, cut it though the
middle and it reads reggae
right through it. But don't try this
one at home, ladies and gentle-
men, since it may seriously impair
your C D ' s performance. H e is one
of the new breed of Rasta youths
who have re-found their religion
and gone right back to their roots.
His message is not concerned with
pop trivialities; instead his sweet
vocals are laced with religious
overtones, cultural issues and
ancient w i s d o m from the West
Indies. Described as a 'sing-jay',
(no, not some kind of well-plumed
night bird), he produces a blend of
singing and DJing that is certainly
interesting in sound, and he impro-
vises all the time. Sizzla certainly
has a smooth, pleasant vocal style.
Not that dissimilar from that of
Finley Quaye's or Jay Kay's, from
Jamiroquai.
Don't be fooled though, Sizzla
is no Bob Marley. Whilst the beats
and rhythm of the music Sizzla pro-
duces may sound similar in nature
there is little to get excited about or
get hooked on. You will not find
yourself with that "catchy little
Sizzla tune" playing over and over
in your head all day. The problem is
the lyrics are too concerned with
serious issues of race, culture and
religion to make them enjoyable or
fun. There are some g o o d tracks o n
Praise ye jah though. The title track
and Haile Selassie both have a
more upbeat feel to them which
c o m e s as a pleasant relief from the
monotony of the rest of the tracks.
Overall the album is pleasant
enough, g o o d as background
music with the tracks tending to
blend together. This certainly is not
a must, even for reggae fans, I dare
say. But for anyone that wants to
be immersed in typical Caribbean
rhythms and tunes I suppose this is
as g o o d as it gets.

Shed 7 - She Left Me On A Friday
The Sheds have gone more funky with this new
track, probably the first release from their forth-
coming third album. It is an excellent ctachy mix
of funky shout-along lyrics and nearly as bouncy
as Supergrass' Alright.
Catherine Wheel - Ma Solituda
The appeal of this record is in the expressive-
ness and expansiveness presented to the listen-
er. It is along the same lines as the epic Drugs
Don't Work by heroes of the hour the Verve.
lames - Destiny Calling
Here, James attack the music industry, dis-
cussing how they and dozens of other bands
that make up the industry are a bunch of freaks.
Perhaps it is a little ironic that they're about to
release a 'Greatest Hits' album. So they're not
selling their fans out in any way then.
Breaker - Carousel
Yet another band from Sweden, along with cur-
rent ones like the Wannadies, the Cardigans,
Grass Show, and we must not forget golden
oldies like Abba and Roxette. Not so p o p p y here
, but a mix of Smashing Pumpkins and Hole.
Jason
Snow Patrol - Little Hide
Initially pleasingly reminiscent of ' M y Bloody
Valentine' but they don't build on this. Thin
vocals and a lack of imagination make for a
worthless pile of poo.
Nick Heyward - Stars In Her Eyes
This is g o o d for a whole five seconds before
descending into a type of poncey pap compris-
ing dull vocals and the requisite piano. Let's just
say that this song wouldn't be out of place in an
elevator....
Ultrasound - Best Wishes
Really rather pleasant and very atmospheric with
an o d d but likeable singer. Not truly outstanding
but certainly worth looking into: Ultrasound
could well be one to watch.
James Iha - Be Strong Now
Anyone expecting Smashing Pumpkins-esque
guitar workouts are going to be majorly disap-
pointed with this lifeless, light, country-type
song. It could have been written and played by
anyone, and although lha's voice is fairly good,
I expected much better from such a talented
guitarist.
Daytona - American Disco Dancer
Straightforward puerile and radio friendly indie
which uses too many cliches for its o w n g o o d .
Not terrible enough to slate with my normal glee
but hardly the best thing since that 98p Burger
offer.
Novocaine - Million Miles
Unremarkable and conventional processed rock
with 'en vogue' distorted vocals make up an
acceptable attempt to be dark and menacing.
Vaguely catchy for some reason but this really
isn't very g o o d aCJH-
