October, Phase-2 renovations will be complete and we will have around
200 students.

responsible for the pastoral care and discipline of the students. Along with
the day-to-day running o f the hall, there are a wide range of social events

You will need to be a caring and mature individual who has the energy to
work hard for the hall and who is comfortable with responsibility and
willing to take the initative. In return, you will receive rent-free accommo-

Easter-98.
