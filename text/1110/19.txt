Good? It's absolutely brilliant!
GOOD WILL HUNTING
Starring: Robin Williams, Matt D a m o n
Director:Gus Van Sant
A
film about a tough but
charismatic genius with
problems, trying to fit in at
one of the best technical colleges
in the country might seem a famil-
iar t h e m e to readers of Felix.
Fortunately, it is set in the more
picturesque Boston, a n d the
people in the film are far prettier,
too.
N e w c o m e r Matt D a m o n (who
co-wrote the screenplay with best
friend and co-star Ben Affleck) is
Will Hunting, an angry young man,
but one w h o is blessed with a pho-
tographic memory and the ability
to instantly solve complex mathe-
matics problems. However, Will
prefers menial jobs, drinking with
his best mate Chuckie (Affleck) and
getting into trouble. W h e n he is
staring at a jail sentence, his only
way out is offered by a maths
professor, providing he hones his
talent and visit a college academic
/ therapist (Robin Williams). It is the
sessions with the therapist, and the
flourishing of a relationship with a
student at MIT (Minnie Driver), that
hold the key to Will's survival.
This is a quite superb movie.
The screenplay, although written by
youngsters, is warm, funny, intelli-
gent and poignant. The acting is
excellent, from the young talent to
the s e a s o n e d veterans, with
Williams reminding the audience
why he has been previously n o m i -
nated three times for an Oscar. Van
Sant keeps the film personal with-
out getting overly sentimental, let-
ting the actors d o their work and
the script weave its magic. If you
are not m o v e d by this film then you
had better check your pulse. D

As you'll see from above, the film
of the m o m e n t is Cood Will
Hunting, starring M a t t D a m o n and
Robin Williams in Oscar-winning
form. Films as character-driven as
this are usually laden with senti-
ment, but in Gus Van Sant's movie
the cliches are kept firmly in their
place. All in all, it's the perfect
antidote to the stress of those
impending exams.

B
e afraid, this is a Virginia
Woolf story. Okay, I confess,
1 haven't actually read the
book myself but by all accounts the
film is true to the novel. The time is
1923; the place is London; M r s
Dalloway (Redgrave) is m i d d l e -
aged, married to a man of excellent
social standing and about to throw
a party. The events all take place
from morning to evening, in a
single day. As she prepares for the
party, M r s Dalloway reminisces
about her past, more specifically
thirty years previously w h e n she
was young, beautiful (McElhone)
and undecided over her affections
for an exuberant and adventure-
seeking suitor. By a strange coinci-
dence that same man is back from
India and will be paying her a visit.
Also at the party will be her best
friend of thirty years ago. This is a
g o o d prompt to ponder about the
"What if?"s of life and to see h o w
everybody has turned out.
If the film were just about m i d -
life crisis it w o u l d be rather average
but interwoven w i t h M r s
D o l l o w a y ' s meanderings is the
plight of Septimus Warren Smith
(Graves), a shell-shocked veteran
of W o r l d War I. His angst and his
treatment by the establishment,
the medics in particular, makes for
disturbing viewing. Septimus and
M r s Dalloway never actually meet
each other but his despair touches
her through indirect means. The
conclusion of the film is an insight-
ful contemplation. The novel is in
fact an introspective of Virginia
W o o l f w h o was middle-aged when
she wrote the book. There is the
juxtapositioning of sanity and
insanity, her distaste for the m e d -
ical profession, a hint of lesbianism
and tragically also a suicide.
This film will not appeal to the
action-philes amongst y o u (just the
one explosion) but it w o u l d be
doltish to dismiss it as a mere
period adaptation. The style of the
original narrative w a s ironically
influenced by that new exciting
arts-medium called Cinema. Alan
Cox gives the only mediocre per-
formance from the excellent cast.
The only question w e are left with
is why Redgrave is wearing the
Q u e e n M o t h e r ' s outfit in the open-
ing scenes? O Stef
