YOU'RE READING IC RADIO (?!)
THE IC RADIO PAGE
Hello groovy Felix read-
ers, a n d w e l c o m e to
another installment of the quite
new Radio Page™ in your favourite
(only) college newspaper. This
page is still but an unblossomed
flower, so please make excuses for
it as it blooms into fullness. This
week's piece of minor experimenta-
tion is another DJ profile; this time
it's Nelson Frisbee with Spencer
Wriggly. Playing mostly playlist
stuff, they include regular features
such as Crap Names in Pop, And
This Just In, The Funky Favourite
Disco Diamond, Spencer's Gig
Guide, and The Aural Sandwich.
M m m m m , tasty.
Sum up your show in no more
than three words.
SW: Weekly M o n d a y lunchtimes.
You obviously do a lot of talking
on your show. What do you think
of each others oral technique?
NF: Sorry but I don't understand
the question.
SW: Are y o u referring to our vocal
or sexual abilities? It's too ambigu-
ous a question to
answer properly.
What's your
Crap Names in
Pop section
about?
NF: W e d o an expose of those with
crap names in p o p . Y o u know that
Fat Boy Slim's real name is Norman
Cook, Photek's called Rupert and
Marylin Manson's really Brian.
How many people listen to your
show?
NF: The latest RAJAR figures have
been put around 6.7 million.
SW: That doesn't take into account
group listening, though.
What's your favourite song at the
moment?
SW: Finley Quaye: Your Love Gets
Sweeter
NF: Freestylers: B-boy Stance
How did you get into music?
NF: Climbed in through the window
SW: I used the door
NF: Smart arse
What are your favourite clubs in
London?
NF: The orange, mint and fruity
ones.
SW: Penguins are
better though.
With Crufts just
around the cor-
ner, if you could
train a bitch to do anything, what
would you make her do?
NF: The d o .
SW: Like Betty Boo.
What interests you the most?
NF: Horticulture, I grow my o w n
vegetables. I'm very g o o d at mar-
row's...
How big is your biggest marrow?
NF: 3 stone 25. W o n second prize
in the lllingworth and District annu-
al show 1996.
SW: Nelson's sister entered one as
well but it came last. Still, I think it's
always worthwhile to have a crack.
How much would you get your kit
off for?
SW: £23.81
NF: N o , I'd say higher. £ 2 3 . 8 3
Burger King or MacDonalds?
NF: Whimpeys (sic)
What do you think of the Union?
6 March 1998
SW: I normally don't bother with
them. They're only g o o d with pasta
dishes- just thinking about them
with anything else makes me cry.
I said 'Union', not 'onion'
Both: O h .
How long do you last?
NF: W e d o it between the news.
What's the most funny thing
you've done pissed?
NF: Saw Alan Parker at the Comedy
Store.
If Crapital FM gave you a contract,
would you take it?
NF: N o t up the Crapital, no.
SW: Sounds painful, doesn't it?
If your life was a pilot TV show,
would you get a series?
NF: I'd get a fucking channel.
