ACTUA GOLF 2 ACTUA HOCKEY ACTUA SOCCER 2
PC review * * *
I'll admit that trudging around a
golf course in the pouring rain isn't
really m y cup of tea. However, the
aforementioned h o t beverage
sums up the style of Coif 2 pretty
well... a sedate pace, enjoyable
flavour, and probably more likely
to be enjoyed by the older genera-
tion.
It's worth mentioning that the
accelerated graphics of this g a m e
are really very g o o d indeed. In fact,
it is hard t o see h o w a golf g a m e
could look any better.
There is a choice of control
methods, but the basic 3-clicks of
the mouse is both intuitive a n d
skillful.
I'm not a much of a lover of
golf games, but if y o u are then this
is bound t o be a hit.
PS review * * V i
C o m p a r e d to Soccer 2, Hockey
appears slow a n d lumbering.
Admittedly the graphics are nicely
detailed, with impressive lighting
and reflections from the icy sur-
face. However, they are rather
jerky and fail to recreate the fluid-
ity of play that normally
accompanies a real ice hockey
game.
Sound is quite amusing, with
h a m m o n d - o r g a n style tunes
throughout play. Sound effects are
appropriate a n d nicely used, but
the whole experience s o m e h o w
fails to gel into a cohesive whole.
The control system is ade-
quate, but 1 just couldn't get the
hang of it really. Perhaps hockey is
simply t o o unusual a subject for a
sports sim.
PERIPHERALS OF A DODGY NATURE
= = What is it?
This is a n example of a
Playstation ' m o d chip'.
What does it do?
A sneaky bundle of transistors,
it allows y o u to play imported
and ' C D backup copies' (ahem)
of games.
Why would I want to do that?
Imported games from USA and
Japan run a bit faster, as their
TVs have a 6 0 H z refresh rate
(as o p p o s e d to 5 0 H z for EU).
Also, games tend to c o m e out

An update to the successful origi-
nal, Soccer 2 builds u p o n its
predecessor's strengths of a fluid
control system, g o o d graphics a n d
'real' commentary.
The most outstanding feature
of this game are the graphics.
Wonderfully smooth a n d detailed,
you're sure to scream "Yesss! You
beauty!" upon witnessing your first
action replay. A w o r d about the
replay system - it is simply excel-
lent, with ball tracking (as seen o n
Sky Sports), more viewpoints than
you can shake a stick at a n d vari-
able speed. You can have a replay
at any time, t o o . The only thing
that's missing is an ability to save
them to memory card.
The commentary is reasonable,
although as ever it does tend to
grate after a while. A s this is fairly
inevitable, this is really only a
minor failing.
Gameplay is both fluid a n d
realistic, although I w o u l d advise
new players to practice against a
friend before challenging the c o m -
puter opponents - but then I could
never play football anyway.
The only real fault is that it is
quite hard to defend your goal. I
found that control switched from
player to player unpredictably.

European release. S o m e
Japanese g a m e s are never
released in the UK.
What's the drawback?
For import games y o u will need
an RGB lead (£ 1 5) and a decent
S C A R T - s o c k e t e d TV t o v i e w
them, as they output a different
signal...
How much does it cost?
The chip itself is £ 7 or it can be
fitted for £ 2 0 + postage.

N 2 0 could easily find its way into
my collection w h e n released.
L o o k i n g like a cross between
T e m p e s t 2 0 0 0 a n d s o m e very
g o o d drugs, it promises fast-paced
tunnel thrills.
If y o u like your racing games dis-
tinctly from the Mariokart school
of design, then Buggy should
appeal. Bonuses galore await, a n d
a splitscreen 2 player m o d e looks
interesting too.
Hardwar is a futuristic Elite-style
g a m e set o n Titan. M o o d y , foggy
graphics lend the g a m e a
Bladerunner feel. G r o o v y spot
lighting effects a n d a strong flight
simulation feel could easily make
this g a m e a winner.
Motorhead is yet another driving
game. Quite whether it will lift
itself from the pack remains to be
seen, but initial impressions are
g o o d .
Tamagotchi has broken free from
your keyrings and has made its
way onto the P C at last. Yes, y o u
can n o w be kept up at night and
pestered by alien pets in full colour
and with more games and options
than ever before!
Premier Manager 98 should
appeal t o budding Alex Fergersons.
Sharing a graphics engine with
Actua Soccer 2 seems to have
done it no harm at all.
