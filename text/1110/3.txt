Attack of the Green Rag in Drag
Wellingtons
DAVID ROBERTS
An estimated quarter of a million
demonstrators d e s c e n d e d o n
London last Sunday for t h e
'Countryside M a r c h ' , the biggest
o r g a n i s e d
protest in t h e
UK since t h e
C N D rallies of
the early eight-
ies. They had
congregated t o
voice their fears
that t h e gov-
ernment are
m a r g i n a l i s i n g
rural issues, cit-
ing government
backed m o v e s
to b a n fox-
hunting a n d
introduce t h e
'right t o roam'.
M o r e than t w o t h o u s a n d
coaches a n d twenty-nine special
trains were laid o n , delivering the
marchers to the Embankment for
the 10.20am start. Kitted-out t o a
man in green wellies a n d anoraks,
they carried a bizarre mix of plac-
ards; "We Support Blair Coursing",
"Scottish Terrier M e n Say N o Way",
"For Fox Sake, Listen", "Let The
C o w s M o o " a n d " B u y British
Cheese" were just some of the slo-
gans o n offer. Over the next few
hours, the organisers c l a i m
2 8 4 , 5 0 0 people c o m p l e t e d t h e
march, from the north bank o f the
Thames, through Trafalgar Square
and d o w n Piccadilly, to the finish in
Hyde Park, where they p a s s e d
under a huge banner saying "Finish",
as if it w a s the London Marathon.
Along the way, the marchers were
joined by the sounds of M a r c h F M ,
a one-day London-wide radio sta-
tion backed by the Duke of
Westminster's millions.
The marchers' main protest was
against the government's attempts
to ban fox hunting. Although opin-
ion polls
reflect a vast
majority i n
favour of ban-
ning the hunts,
many of the
protestors felt
that a b a n
would destroy
a w a y of life,
both for the
landed aris-
tocracy w h o
enjoy the
'sport', a n d
their employ-

livelihood is
dependant o n the industry which
surrounds the hunts. A s a result of
the march, the government have
now backed down, and are sug-
gesting that legitimate hunts will be
"certified", and allowed to continue.
Although widely regarded as a
success, there were notes of dis-
sent along the way. A small group
of anti-hunting demonstrators hud-
dled together in a corner of the park
in o p p o s i t i o n , but without any
speeches from the organisers of the
march, they seemed completely
purposeless. T h e only serious
opposition came from a group of
protesters w h o hijacked the March
F M frequency, drowning o u t the
official programming with their own
'Hunt Saboteurs Broadcasting
Corporation', which, in the best
countryside tradition, told t h e
marchers to "Fuck off our land".

After rumours of baked bean
attacks and the infamous hit
squad, you might have been for-
given for hibernating for the
duration of rag week, but there
was no escape.
Rag 9 8 kicked off with the
Foreskins; four brave souls raised
m o n e y by having their heads
shaved, as the hair w a s ceremoni-
ously auctioned off to the cheering
supporters in the Reynolds Bar. A
variety o f events were planned
throughout t h e w e e k : M o n d a y
evening started off with a barn
d a n c i n g session, f o l l o w e d o n
Tuesday by a c o m e d y night with
Charlie Cheese - M a n o f t h e
Seventies - met which some inter-
esting reviews from spectators.
O n W e d n e s d a y night t h e
Reynolds Bar was transformed into
the h o m e of the celebrities as Stars
in their Eyes boasted the likes o f
Tom Jones, Lionel Richie, Abba a n d
The Village People. The night w a s
won by M i k e (the Bar Manager) as
Marvin Gaye. The celebrations c o n -
tinued with a bar extension a n d
m o r e strikes from t h e C h a r i n g
Cross hit squad. The fearless hit
squad, d o n n e d in surgical greens,
marked their entrance with t h e
opening bars of Carmina Burana,
music that will for evermore strike
fear into the hearts o f first years.
A n y o n e unfortunate enough t o
have a price o n their heads w a s
shown n o mercy a n d copiously
covered with shaving foam.
Rag W e e k reached its peak o n
Thursday with the last ever Charing
Cross rag review, a hilarious combi-
nation o f sketches from
Trainspotting t o a n Indian restau-
rant. The hit squad carried out their
annual a b d u c t i o n s : Unfortunate
victims were subject t o interroga-
tion a n d packed off t o Wales,
returning the next day with missing
eyebrows. The traditional L o n d o n
invasion involved persuading
unsuspecting tube passengers and
tourists t o part with their cash. The
grand finale was the joint I C S M Rag
Ball at Lloyds of L o n d o n . Amazing
outfits were plentiful, ranging from
the Spice girls (after a sex change),
Cleopatra, Elvis, a n d Titanic, to
name but a few.
The money is still being count-
ed a n d the final amount will be
revealed shortly - all proceeds g o
to Cancer Research.
