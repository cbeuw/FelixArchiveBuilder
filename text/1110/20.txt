KISS THE GIRLS
Starring: M o r g a n Freeman
Ashley Judd
Director:Gary Fleder
S
exy, y o u n g , talented girls
have been abducted, a n d a
few have turned up as cadav-
ers in the w o o d s . They have been
tied-up to a tree and left to die.
One of the abducted girls is the
niece of Washington D C police
detective and forensic psychologist
Alex Cross (Freeman). H e heads to
Durham, North Carolina, out of his
jurisdiction t o conduct his o w n
investigation. His presence rattles
the local law enforcement, but he is
aided by feisty Kate M c t i e t m a n
(Judd) - the one w h o got away. She
knows about the kidnapper w h o
calls himself Casanova, though her
memories are fogged by the drugs
given to her whilst she was abduct-
ed. Together they unravel a trail
which leads from coast t o coast, in
a race against time t o save the
remaining victims.
The suspense builds up well but
then too many twists and turns are
introduced in an attempt t o create
more mystery. Unfortunately this
has the opposite effect and it all
becomes contrived a n d hammy.
What starts as a gripping story by
the end becomes more a question
of curiosity rather than the cliff-
hanger it might have been. Trying
too hard to mix the elements of the
sublime "Chianti-with-liver" with
the successful Seven has resulted
in an infetior work. This is a pity
since the cast is excellent and the
film has many g o o d points. A
near-miss. D

The latest film from those masters
of film noir, the C o e n brothers, is
The Big Lebowskl. T h e m e n
responsible for Far^o have brought
together Jeff Bridges, John
G o o d m a n and Julianne M o o r e for
this critically acclaimed film cen-
tring o n a mistaken identity.
Bridges plays Lebowski, a shame-
lessly lazy and retro guy w h o calls
himself The Dude. H e is mistaken
for an identically n a m e d Pasadena
millionaire by thugs w h o break into
his apartment, leading to a bizarre
tale of extortion, double-crossing,
embezzlement, sex and d o p e .

LESBIAN AND CAY FILM FESTIVAL
O
ne of the benefits of study-
ing in London is the wealth
of films s h o w n throughout
the capital. The annual programme
of 2 0 0 0 or s o films at the National
Film Theatre is part of this eclecti-
cism. N e s t l e d under W a t e r l o o
Bridge o n the South Bank, the NFT
is responsible for the L o n d o n Film
Festival, retrospectives, post-film
discussions and features as well as
being behind the London Lesbian
and Cay Film Festival. T h e usual
p r o g r a m m e o f recent re-runs,
reviews, cult tuns a n d archive
footage shows across three screens
throughout the year. For example
the current shows include a season
of Rogers and Hammerstein musi-
cals and soon the NFT will screen a
special preview o f Cattaca, the
near-future Nature vs. Nurture tale
followed by a debate o n genetic
engineering which promises t o be
well-informed and lively.
The twelfth London Lesbian and
Gay Film Festival runs from 12 to
26 M a r c h . Over 180 films will be
screened, including Asian a n d
African films as well as the usual
plethora of North . American a n d
European cinema. This year "cross
appeal" is the buzz-phrase. The
collection of shorts, general films
and the galas have been selected t o
interest lesbian a n d gay viewers
and film audiences in general.
This year's highlights feature
w e l l - k n o w n actors, singers a n d

two dykons - K.D. Lang and Sophie
B. Hawkins - have been filmed and
form part of the Festival. C a m e o
appearances include Lilly Tomlin
and M a r y Tyler M o o r e in Reno
Finds Her Mom. Barbarella with
Jane Fonda has a late night slot as
well as The Score - a story of 70's
swingers with which Boogie Nights
and The Ice Storm just cannot c o m -
pete.
Rising stars to watch out fot in
the future include Danny Nucci and
Steve Bell. O f note are Dakan. the
first gay film made in Africa and The
Brandon Teena Story which reviews
the life and murder of male imper-
sonator a n d " S m a l l - T o w n U S A
