MUSIC 6 March 1998
It's all good in the hood. Last week saw two big music awards ceremonies in the Grammy's and the Soul Train Awards
as well as worrying rumours of Choice FM selling up and moving on.
W e l c o m e back to your regular
dose o n the happenings in the
R&B world. Last week w e had the
G r a m m y s a n d the Soul Train
awards. The highlight of t h e
Grammys was the W u Tang Clan's
O l ' Dirty Bastard, he bum-rushed
the s h o w to make the announce-
ment that 'Wu-Tang is for the chil-
dren'. What the fuck? The awards
for rap s e e m e d t o be watered
d o w n , with Will Smith a n d Puffy
picking u p awards for A l e n In
Black and No Way Out, t w o huge-
ly successful products c o m m e r -
cially, but the best in their category? Erykah
Badu cleaned up at both winning best album,
single, new artist, best performance by a female,
about time they got something right. For a third
year in a row Babyface picked u p best producer,
setting a n e w record for this award, he then
went o n stage with Stevie W o n d e r and they per-
formed their hit single How Come, How Long.
The 12th annual installment of the Soul Train
awards, based o n a survey of radio program-
mers a n d record retailers, were dished out in
LA's Shrine Auditorium. The hosts for the event
were soul legend Patti LaBelle a n d the big man
Heavy D . Whitney H o u s t o n received the Quincy
Jones Award for career achievement, a n d then
watched Erykah win all four awards she w a s u p
for. The best rap album went to Biggie for his
double Life After Death, although deserved,
can't help thinking he wouldn't have g o t this if
he w a s alive. Puffy a d d e d yet another award to
his collection in the form of the S a m m y Davis Jr
entertainer of the year award.
Rumour has it that, once again, after failing
to secure a London wide broadcasting licence
the Choice F M management wants to sell u p .
They have been trying in vain to get a London
wide licence but have been blocked at every
turn, a n d have decided enough is enough a n d
they want out. The thought of London losing the
only real black music station is worrying, Kiss
(who by the way have recently signed Dani Behr
to d o a show) seems to be turning into a more
and more of a garage and dance station, but as
I said it's just rumour a n d hopefully won't be
happening. Peace out. Here c o m e s some album
news from Roni. Milen

T

The soundtrack itself is

top artists recording average t o
middling tracks... what is D O E S
have is the return of Schoolly
D , orchestral m o o d y m u s i c
from Joe Delia, U 2 , Brew,
Heather Redd, Gretchen M o l ,
Jill Wolfe a n d Harper Simon.
This eclectic m i x results in a
diversified album. Schoolly D ,
the gangsta rap pioneer,
returns with more of the same
but with all the usual piaya
stylings that is the n o r m n o w a -
days. H i s collaborations with
Joe Delia provide pianos, gui-
tars a n d hip h o p beats mixed
together a n d s o u n d s g o o d .
Elsewhere, Grethen M o l p r o -
vides tracks combining Spanish
guitars, hard beats and monot-
one lyrics that work well. 112
provide a slow s o n g that crash-
es with guitars m i d w a y
through, a n d Heather R e d d
utilises her voice to g o o d
effect.
This album pretty m u c h has
something for everyone with
quite a few tracks mixed up
with styles from different gen-
res in o n e song! The album
actually D O E S sound like it is
probably played in the movie
unlike most releases! Another
g o o d point to note is that it
gives the listener the chance to
listen to other types of music
which is n o bad thing. Puff
Daddy a n d the Foo Fighters.
Texas a n d the W u Tang Clan.
Way back in the day, Public
Enemy a n d Anthrax. Prodigy's
remix of M e t h o d M a n ' s
