ALAN SILLITOE
A Haldane Collection Cultural Event
I
've always been a prodigious
reader. In m y second year at
senior school, m y teacher, tired
of my finishing books weeks before
the rest of the class, gave m e Alan
Sillitoe's, The Loneliness of a Long-
Distance Runner, probably to con-
fuse my thirteen year o l d brain.
Unluckily for her, it didn't put m e off
reading, and luckily for me, it got m e
interested in Alan Sillitoe, so when I
heard that he was going to c o m e to
Imperial to read from his new book.
Alligator Playground, I jumped at the
chance to g o and listen.
Alan Sillitoe started his writing
career properly in 1958, with
Saturday Night, Sunday Morning,
and b e c a m e famous with The
Loneliness of a Long Distance
Runner, a book of short stories
which w o n the Hawthorne Prize.
Since then, he has written numer-
ous volumes of poetry, many plays,
for both screen a n d stage, as well
as novels and short stories. H e
believes firmly that a writer is in the
business of communication, a belief
that probably originates from h i m
having been an RAF telegraph oper-
ator after leaving school. H e had
wanted to write a novel about this
peculiar breed of people for a long
time, a n d eventually wrote The
Flying Boat in 1983.
The second extract was from
The Loneliness, called On Saturday
Afternoon. It's about a young boy,
w h o misses out on a cinema trip,
and instead watches a man attempt
to commit suicide. Written from the
point of view of the child, it is real-
ly about the differences in types of
depression. The child's father has
terribly black m o o d s , where he
shouts at his wife and children,
throws things about and kills flies by
throwing them in the fire. The sui-
cidal m a n has that bleak depres-
sion, where y o u stare into space,
and can never see any positivity at
all, a n d don't even want to. The
attempt fails; the light bulb he has
strung the rope from breaks. The
man is arrested and taken to hospi-
tal. Here, he's put into a ward o n
the sixth floor, and kills himself by
jumping out of a pane of glass onto
the road. The irony of this isn't lost
on the boy, young as he is.
His penultimate reading w a s
about a one-night stand. This story
was extremely beautiful a n d
poignant, with the couple both
clearly feeling the same confusion
and the same tenderness for each
other. Set in France, a n d featuring
two English people on the way back
to their normal lives after their holi-
days, this story really showed the
frailty of humans a n d the fragility of
human relationships. I don't want
to give too much away here as that
would spoil it, but it really is a w o n -
derful story. Alan Sillitoe manages
to write extremely convincing char-
acters; the m a n even leaves her his
business card with "Thanks for
everything" written on it. O f course,
he leaves without saying goodbye.
After this he answered ques-
tions on his work, describing h o w
he c a m e to write Her Victory, his
longest novel, from a chance
encounter o n a street, and the dif-
ference between his novels and his
poetry. Novels c o m e from deep
within you, short stories from even
deeper, and that poetry c o m e s
from the deepest level yet' To
demonstrate, he read us a p o e m
called Shadows, which deals with
the fear of death. Alan Sillitoe is one
of the finest writers in England at
the moment, long may he continue.
