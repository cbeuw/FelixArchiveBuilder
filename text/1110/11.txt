THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:
I don't feel very well.
"...To-night thou shalt have
cramps..."
-Shakespeare
M
ost of the memories of the
dramatic climax of the i C U
Sabbatical elections have
faded now, but the plague of illness
that infested my system o n that
fateful night is still sadly conspicu-
ous by its presence. Christ. Reading
out the ballot box figures while
hacking, wheezing and generally
suffering from the thousand natural
coughs that flesh is heir to was a
task more tricky than the most
fiendish of differential equations or
control theory.
The worst things in life are free,
and it has to be said that bacteria
and viruses d o not charge very
much for their services. Illness ulti-
mately comes in two varieties; the
type which y o u don't mind having,
and the type which y o u d o . The for-
mer variety w a s often joyously
prevalent during m y schooldays,
where a quick thermometer on the
radiator would occasionally prevent
an unwanted test, field day, or
sports trial... I thoroughly used to
enjoy sitting and watching the con-
tinuing and enthralling adventures
of Postman Pat while lying on the
sofa and drinking hot chocolate.
That's clever; they've used clingfilm
for the water under the bridge. O h ,
no... his van won't start. A h , this is
the life. I wonder how they are get-
ting on in Games?
Unfortunately for me (cough)
real illnesses are the real enemy;
battles waged in the nervous sys-
tems, bowels and a u t o - i m m u n e
systems of unlucky punters world-
wide, causing inestimable grief and
illness. Tragically, these always
c o m e along w h e n w e don't want
t h e m to, and Postman Pat loses his
appeal w h e n you're supposed to
be somewhere interesting instead.
Isn't there a pub called Greendale?
Isn't there a beer called Jess?
M a y b e I'll get high if I drink enough
B e e c h a m s ' C o l d P o w d e r s .
Headaches, the staple diet of the
ailing, p o u n d away inside the
invalid's skull like an insane navvy
with a pneumatic drill and a pen-
chant fot drum ' n ' bass; a highly
effective but unwanted personal
stereo. Sleep, usually the most
seductive of dark-haired damsels,
becomes a dull, boring minger with
a beard. Then, inevitably, everyone
comes in at four o'clock; drunk,
noisy, irritating and insatiable in
their attempts to tell y o u what a
great time they have had. O h ,
sorry, did I just cough in your face?
Never mind, it only means three
weeks in bed. Heh heh heh.
The worst illnesses of all are
ones that kill people. There is much
concern about diseases w h i c h
infect monkeys, as mutations of
the organisms responsible might
spread the disease to h o m o sapi-
ens. Some of these are incredibly
contagious, and culminate in a
death more painful and undignified
than that of anthrax, where the
unlucky sufferer bleeds from every
orifice, including the eyes. Yuck.
Historically, one of the most vora-
cious slayers has not been AIDS or
CJD, or even one of these scary
potential super-killers, but g o o d old
influenza. Yes, twice since the turn
of the century, flu has claimed mil-
lions of lives in irrepressible epi-
demics. In fact, scientists are so
worried about another outbreak
that they are e x h u m i n g bodies
buried in the permafrost of the icy
northern wastes, believed to have
had their cards punched by the
1919 outbreak, in an effort to
examine the deadly strain of the
virus. Let's just hope they are more
competent than my friend Nick at
school with his Biology agar dishes,
w h o managed to infect half the
year with some terrible and uniden-
tified plague grown from his o w n
sputum.
Despite these terrible mass-
murderers, the micro-organisms
with which w e conduct our every-
day business tend to d o little more
than annoy, so next time y o u
notice the beginnings of the c o m -
m o n cold, be thankful that y o u are
not drowning in your o w n mucus
instead.
