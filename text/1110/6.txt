LETTERS 6 M a r c h 1998
THEIR PETTY
ARGUMENTS
Dear Felix,
I a m writing t o clear up the sea of
inaccuracies regarding G e r m a n
Society which have appeared in the
last few editions of Felix (issues
1105, 1106 &. I 107). Shin Yi Jeng
wrote in his letter (1 105) that it
took three months for O S C to clear
German Society but by my calcula-
tions it w a s just over a month.
Anglo-German Society approached
the Overseas Students Committee
in mid October 1997 for a decision
regarding their n e w society. They
had submitted a constitution and a
list of seconders late the previous
year but this had been lost by the
Union over the summer. To speed
things up for them w e waived the
need to see a new seconders list
and, as with all n e w societies,
reviewed their constitution. W e
found several points to be i n c o m -
patible with the aims of the O S C ,
including their name and several of
their objectives. I explained that in
order t o be accepted by the O S C
they would have t o change these
points because their aims e m p h a -
sised British-German relations
rather than promotion of German
culture, but Anglo-German Society
themselves d e c i d e d that they
would prefer to keep their constitu-
tion as it was.
I then suggested S C C as the
next avenue to explore since soci-
eties such as Irish, Welsh, Sikh and
Tamil Societies, which d o not read-
ily fall under the O S C banner,
belong to SCC. However, S C C were
unwilling t o take them on. Contrary
to M a r k Baker's information
(1107), the matter w a s then
referred t o Rob Clark, the DP (F&S)
(there w a s no D P (C&S) at the
time), w h o thought it best that they
join O S C . Anglo-German Society
duly changed their n a m e (to
German Society) and t w o of their
objectives and joined O S C by late
November. They were not 'kindly'
taken o n by O S C but rather
because they revised their constitu-
tion. G e r m a n Society perhaps
unknowingly prolonged the process
by initially declining to change their
constitution.
1 believe the decisions 1 made
with and o n behalf of the O S C can
only be described as accountable,
necessary and fair

The inefficiency and general poor
treatment received by Shin Yi Jeng
and friends may be no surprise,
but there is something here I
don't understand: If they wanted
an Anglo-German society, then
why the hell couldn't they have
one? It is ludicrous to say that
their aims were "incompatible
with the aims of the O S C " and
outrageous that they were
excluded and forced to change
their constitution. The CSCs are
there to support students' clubs
whatever they are, and certainly
not there to dictate what they can
and cannot do. Ed
Dear Felix,
W e are writing to clear up a
number of points that have been
raised in recent weeks with regard
to the Anglo-German Society (now
German society) and the confusion
that surrounds the acceptance of
the club.
The A n g l o - G e r m a n society
came to a meeting of the Social
Clubs C o m m i t t e e (11/11/97),
where the matter of them joining
SCC was debated by the attending
chairs of S C C clubs. It w a s noted
that the aims of the proposed club
d u p l i c a t e d another ( E R A S M U S ) ,
and that the coexistence of the
clubs would be detrimental to both.
They were advised to reapply to
the O S C , who accepted them as
the German society less than t w o
weeks later.
In total, the S C C was involved
in this process for less than one
month. CSCs d o not meet more
regularly than once a month (to
save bureaucracy). The C S C system
works, and succeeds in being what
it is designed t o be — a facility t o
run clubs and societies by students
for students.
Yours,
Caroline Gibbons, SCC Chair
Karen Yates, SCC HJT
Dear Felix
It was very encouraging indeed
to have received so many support-
ive responses in the last two weeks
regarding the trouble I went
through in setting up the Anglo-
German Society. N o w I want t o
clear up one last problem: I am not
a he; I a m a she!
Sincerely
MISS Shin Yi Jeng
WATERSTONE'S
WARNING
Dear Felix,
Whilst 1 would love to believe
that Waterstones are "just firing a
warning shot", I remember wanting
to think a similar thing about the
bookshop a couple of years ago. 1
hope that Felix continues to cover
this issue well (and that IC students
read it!) so that a Bookstore Mark II
cannot occur.
Thanks,
Karen Yates (Physics 4)
OFF!
Dear Jeremy,
Re R e d Card for Football
Fourths
I a m writing o n behalf of the
football club committee as it is felt
there are several issues that need
to be addressed. The incident at
Bath was regrettable and does not
bring credit to the club, union or
college - this is not in question.
However, the article in question
was one-sided and unfair. As far as
1 a m aware, no-one from the foot-
ball club was contacted before the
article was written and s o the arti-
cle w a s inevitably prejudiced.
M e m b e r s of the fourth team have
described their behaviour as loud
and boisterous, as the bar evenings
of sports teams tend t o be, but
hardly abusive until they were dealt
with in a confrontational and inap-
propriate manner.
The tone of the article is also
unfortunate - it seems to be advo-
cating severity to the disciplinary
committee, which is hardly Felix's
role in college - as is the reference
to c o m m e n t s attributed t o the
club's captain, Donal Keane (please
note the spelling), which he cannot
remember making a n d especially
not in the context that they were
presented i n . The club's players
often play twice and train once a
week, and the teams' performances
this year have reflected their efforts
- a U L U cup final this Saturday for
the firsts and the best results of any
London college in BUSA - and find
it disheartening when they seem to
be under attack from the very organ
that should be lauding their efforts.
While w e realise that students
can only spend so long o n their
Felix investigations, articles that are
a little more considered would be
appreciated.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Dunsby (deceased)
