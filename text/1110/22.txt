THE WEIR
The Royal Court
S
t o r i e s toid in a bar are
rarely of this quality.
Instead of the usual style of
bar reminiscence. The Weir deals
with haunting stories about ghosts
and the supernatural. The set, a
bar in various shades of brown,
enhanced the feeling of small-
town life. Here is where the story
takes place, and judging from the
first half hour, the play would be
ttivial; cleverly written, a n d in
some places extremely funny, but
ultimately trivial. It s e e m e d as if it
was going to drift along, with the
audience merely required to
absorb the gloomy atmosphere.
The atmosphere shifts subtly
when Valerie arrives. A stranger
from Dublin, she is a very pretty
woman, w h o has, for her o w n pri-
vate reasons, chosen to c o m e to
this deserted place for peace and
quiet. From being a purely male
environment, the arena b e c o m e s
almost erotically charged, with the
men telling their ghost stories in
order to impress her. The men are
all heavily superstitious, and s e e m
to want to believe in ghosts,
despite laughing at themselves. I
couldn't help thinking that all the
stories were either embroidered or
brought on by alcohol. This was
justified by one of the characters
describing how he had drunk vast
quantities of potein, the potato
spirit, on top of a dose of the 'flu',
a combination which w o u l d induce
ghosts even in the least imagina-
tive of us. Valerie, well-educated
and unsuperstititious, is the only
one w h o ' s truly p o s s e s s e d by
ghosts, and her story brought a
lump the size of a tennis ball to my
throat. M c P h e r s o n , with spine-tin-
gling ease, makes use of confes-
sional monologues to build dra-
matic tension. H e persuasively
suggests old Ireland, possessed by
hallucinations; by an eerie sense of
the supernatural.
Eavesdropping in a rural Irish
bar turned out to be a wonderful
experience, full of tragedy and
comedy, and a deep persuasive
sense of humanity. The Weir unites
the Irish love of fable with the
Chekovian sense of waste, with
every character either having lost
something precious, or never hav-
i n
S gained anything. This is a w o n -
derful play, beautifully set, and
well-acted, go and see it, it will
stay with y o u for weeks.

THOMAS SCHUTTE
Whitechapel Art Gallery
T
his is the first major exhibi-
tion of the German artist
Thomas Schutte. It offers a
retrospective of over twenty years
of diverse work, including water-
colours, sculptures and architectur-
al models.
The exhibition begins with a
collection of small figures in bell
jars. They are s u p p o r t e d on
c o l u m n s at head height, but
instead of just one figure per bell
jar, there are two, bound together
in masking tape. People stare at
them, the figures grotesque plas-
tacine faces showing their embar-
rassment of the situation. A few
make the best of it - one in partic-
ular seems to be offering sexual
benediction to his smiling friend.
But these figures are telling a story.
Like t w o enemies united in an
uneasy alliance, the variety of ges-
tured poses show the many faces
of politics. Everywhere, high on the
walls are photographs of these
pathetic faces - a gallery of the
d a m n e d - each one sneering at
us,asking if we are any different.
M o v i n g on, the floor becomes
alive with curious humanoid stat-
ues: looking disturbingly similar to
aluminium versions of the marsh-
mallow man from Ghostbusters,
these nine foot giants litter the
gallery floor like bemused Doctor
W h o aliens. They look lost and
confused, gesturing and milling
around in small groups as though in
conversation. O n e statue sticks his
tongue out, but his friend seems
more interested in the nearby
watercolours. Another looks like
he's m o w i n g the lawn: he bites his
lower lip in earnest concentration.
Light plays off their shiny w h i p p e d
cream features, constantly chang-
ing as you move around them. It
brings them to life and y o u can't
help feeling sympathetic and
involved with these poor child-like
aliens.
It was the watercolour portraits
that I was most impressed with.
Schutte paints very quickly, captur-
ing fleeting moments of time in
e c o n o m i c a l lines and often
abstract areas of dark w a s h .
Although sketchy, they are power-
fully drawn: there is w i d e eyed
innocence and brooding sensuous-
ness.
Overall, Schutte's work repre-
sents a departure from 'modem'art
- it does not require a title for the
work to have any meaning. Rather
the viewer is encouraged to make
up their o w n mind about it. It's free
and if y o u find yourself near
Whitechapel, it's well worth a visit.

ANTIGONE
Riverside Studio
I
s Greek drama still relevant?
Our regard for our rich literary
past is practically non-existent.
These days, w h e n the bloody
Teletubbies are a more popular
attraction in Stratford-upon-Avon
than Shakespeare's birth-place,
and less and less people are taught
Classics at school, one would be
tempted to say no. So, when you
hear that a theatre company is
putting o n a p r o d u c t i o n of
S o p h o c l e s ' Antigone, your first
thought is "Just what is the point of
that?" Well, mine wasn't, because
I've read the play, I've seen it as
part of the O e d i p u s trilogy, and I
know that stories about human
relationships are always relevant,
whether they were written in
4 4 2 B C , I 5 7 0 A D or this morning.
Antigone is a play about hon-
our, betrayal, love, fear and duty.
The story is ultimately tragic, and
contains ideas that have disturbed
p e o p l e for over t w o thousand
years.
Antigone is O e d i p u s ' youngest
daughter. After his disgrace and
downfall, she went with him to
Colonus, where he died, at the
shrine of the Furies. Before he
died, both his two sons wanted his
support against their brother, and
he cursed them. With the results of
this curse, Antigone begins.
Both brothers are dead, and
one cannot be buried, he must lie
outside the city walls as a mark of
his disgrace. Antigone wants to
bury her brother, but due to her
uncle's decree, she would be killed
if she d i d . To further complicate
things, she is in love with her
cousin, and he is in love with her.
She dies in the end; this is Greek
tradegy after all.
H u m a n e m o t i o n s haven't
changed, it's just our situations
that are different. Civil war still
exists, as d o hate, incest, love and,
for all our cynicism, fragility. So, d o
y o u still think Greek d r a m a is
irrelevant?

Antigone is showing at the
Riverside Studios, Hammersmith
next week. See diary pages for
more detail, or email me at Felix
for more details
Just enough room this week to say: c o m e along to Salad Days, it's great,
and also U L O G are performing Fidler on the Roof next week, which is
also worth going to see. Plugging your o w n show makes this job worth-
while. (Heaves deep sigh, audience reach for Kleenex)
