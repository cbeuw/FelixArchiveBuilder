We are also encouraging people to create their own money raising events - this
is how you win the special prizes at the bottom of the page. Simply, come to the
RAG Week meeting, and let us know what you are up to.
The observant of you may have noticed posters advertising SPONSORED
PARACHUTE JUMPING, on behalf of Shelter. If you're idea of fun is falling
thousands of feet from a plane towards a very solid earth, then get in touch.
