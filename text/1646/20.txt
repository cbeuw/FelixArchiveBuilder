The Wii U was, to be frank, not that successful
and probably dented Nintendo’s position. Now
they’ve introduced the Switch with a load of new
features. Question is, will it be enough?

Mario game was shown,
along with NBA 2K17 and
possibly updated versions of
Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon.
Surprisingly, one of the games
that received the most screen
time was The Elder Scrolls V:
Skyrim. A large chunk of the

T
he year is 2016,
and the Wii U
has been doing
incredibly badly
worldwide for
a number of
years. In March, Nintendo
announced a partnership with
a Japanese mobile provider,
DeNA, to provide some of
their intellectual properties
on mobile platforms. While
this came as a big surprise,
it was the news we received
shortly afterwards that really
set imaginations alight. In a
press conference only a few
days later, they confirmed
that a new hardware platform
was in development, simply
codenamed the “NX”.
Last month, Nintendo
the release date being March
2017.
The Nintendo Switch was
revealed to be a tablet-like
console, with two control-
lers called Joy-Cons that
can attach to both sides of
the console. These can be
detached and used wirelessly,
in a similar fashion to a Wii-
mote and Nunchuk, all while
playing on the tablet. How-
ever, no official information is
available on whether the Joy-
Cons are motion-enabled or if
the tablet has a touchscreen.
The Joy-Cons can also act as
individual controllers when
turned sideways, though they
seem rather small. An acces-
sory called a Joy-Con Grip
is also available, which acts
as a holder for both Joy-Con
controllers (termed L and R
respectively), and a more tra-
ditional Switch Pro Controller
will also be released.
The console itself can be
placed into a dock which
can be connected to a TV for
playing on the big screen.
However, the tablet cannot
be used while docked, so
it seems that Nintendo has
abandoned multi-screen func-
tionality, available on both
the 3DS and the Wii U. By
simply lifting the tablet out of
the dock, you can transition
from TV to handheld, and
to transition from handheld
to TV, you simply place the
tablet back into the dock. It is
extremely simple and seems
to work instantly, with the
game continuing exactly as it
was before the transition.
Nintendo has shown a
number of games being
played on the system, likely
not actual gameplay footage
with him on a plane before
returning home, playing
Skyrim the entire time. They
also showed arguably their
most anticipated upcoming
game, The Legend of Zelda:
Breath of the Wild, which will
also release simultaneously
on the Wii U.
Nvidia announced that
they have been working with
Nintendo to create a custom
Tegra processor to power
the Switch; they currently
use the Tegra in the Nvidia
Shield, their own portable
gaming console. While no
numbers or benchmarks have
been revealed, the fact that
The Legend of Zelda: Breath
of the Wild will release
simultaneously on the Wii U
and Switch means the Switch
should at least rival the Wii U
in terms of performance.
The Switch will play games
using game cards instead
of discs, which is a clever
move as flash media is now
faster, smaller, cheaper and
able to hold more data than
Blu-Rays. Unfortunately, this
implies it won’t be backwards
compatible with the Wii U
or the 3DS. Ports, emulators
or even accessories haven’t
been ruled out to play games
from older systems, though
the latter is more likely a
pipedream.
A number of third-party
game developers and publish-
ers have been confirmed by
Nintendo to be supporting the
Switch. The list is extremely

promising and includes all
the major players as well as
some smaller companies. Of
note are FromSoftware, the
creators of the Souls series
and Bloodborne; Telltale
Games, who are famous for
their point-and-click games;
Bethesda, the minds behind
both The Elder Scrolls and
Fallout; and Platinum Games,
the creators of Metal Gear
Rising: Revengeance and
Bayonetta.
The Switch seems like a
major step in the right direc-
tion from Nintendo; they seem
to be guaranteeing strong
third-party support and are
also trying to appeal to both
casual and core gamers. And
right now, I think it’s definitely
working.
