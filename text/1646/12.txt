Arrival presents us with an
alien invasion scenario where
communication, not confrontation,
is the order of the day. The result
is an intelligent, nuanced science
fiction film, the blockbuster debut of
Canadian director Denis Villeneuve
A
t some point
during their
time at school,
children will
inevitably
be asked to
describe something in simple
enough terms that even an
alien, having just arrived on
Earth, would understand.
Like much of what is taught
at school, this exercise is
completely detached from
reality. It assumes that
another intelligent life form
would speak, that it would
communicate in a language
structured similarly to ours,
and that it would understand
the concepts we use to
express ourselves. Language
is essentially meaningless
without shared experience
or points of reference,
and as humans we are
only able to communicate
across languages (and
translate them) because we
all experience and interact
with the world in a relatively
similar way.
Noam Chomsky, “the father
of modern linguistics”, even
theorised that the structure of
human language is biologi-
cally determined in our mind
and a ‘universal grammar’ (a
sort of inborn understanding
of how to form sentences)
exists. So while we might be
able to communicate on first
contact with a community
living in an unexplored part
of our own planet, trying to
understand and deliver a
message to an alien life form
would be a monumental task.
In Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival,
the extra-terrestrials that
visit Earth communicate in a
way completely unfamiliar
to humans. Faced with the
unknown, humanity attempts
to understand the motivation
of their visitors, who touch
down across twelve landing
sites around the globe. The
story is far removed from
the typical alien invasion
blockbuster; it focuses on the
complex process of translat-
ing a foreign language that
no other human on Earth
understands. We follow this
translation process from the
perspective of linguist Dr.
Louise Banks (Amy Adams),
an academic who quickly
adapts to life on a military
camp stationed close to one
of the alien spacecrafts.
Banks works closely with Ian
Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a
mathematician, as they piece
together the alien language
during the small windows of
contact that the spacecraft
permits them.
The visual spectacle of
modern science-fiction can be
tiresome at times but Arrival
manages to surprise viewers
visually in the most unlikely
of places – language. The
ink-like substance of the aliens
flows satisfyingly each time it
‘spells’ out calligraphic-style
messages, with a circular
structure and grammar that
mirrors the films circular
narrative. Sweeping shots of
massive spacecrafts against
the backdrop of various
familiar (and unfamiliar)
landscapes create the sense
that the whole world is relying
on the exchanges between
Dr. Banks, Donnelly, and
the two alien creatures.
otherworldly as the creatures
that inhabit Arrival’s fictional
universe.
Eric Heisserer’s excellent
script explains the compli-
cated subjects of linguistics
and translation without con-
fusing or condescending
viewers. It’s difficult not to
be awestruck when the team
of experts piece together
another part of the puzzle,
even if these moments are
contrived and implausible.
Beyond these complex
themes, the film focuses on
Dr. Louise Banks’ internal
struggle, and it is ultimately
her emotions – and the
strange visions that she
experiences – that move the
film towards its revelatory
finale. Amy Adams delivers
another fine performance,
outshining Jeremy Renner’s
emotionally flat portrayal of a
rather lonely mathematician.
While Donnelly is never really
explored beyond his role
as a mathematician, we see
the human side of Banks as
she experiences loss and the
struggles of motherhood.
Yet for a film that attempts
to challenge its viewers, the
geopolitics of Arrival fall too
easily into familiar tropes.
When faced with a potentially
existential threat, America is
humanity’s saviour while the
militaristic powers China and
Russia threaten to use force
against Earth’s visitors. This
simplification of our world’s
problems detracts from the
attempted realism of Heisser-
er’s script. If there is any
message to be taken from
Arrival, it is that communica-
tion rather than conflict is the
solution to difficult and unnerv-
ing situations; the film is explicit

Complementing this, Jóhann

It’s rare to leave the cinema
with an optimistic view of how
humanity would react to an
alien invasion. Arrival might
resolve in an unbelievable
way but overall the film feels
far more rooted in reality
than its contemporaries. The
film manages to condense a
long and complex process
into under two hours and as
a result, it simplifies in places
but Villeneuve and Heisserer
complete this task deftly. It is
an ‘intelligent’ blockbuster
that teaches the viewer the
basics of linguistics without
ever feeling like a lecture, and
it sits alongside Ex Machina
and Upstream Colour as one
of the most thought-provoking
science-fiction films of the past
few years.

Girls Lost
T
he subject of gender
transformation has
proved a rich seam
of inspiration at
which artists and
writers have mined
for centuries. From the ancient
Greek myth of Tiresias to
Virginia Woolf’s immortal
gender-swapping count in
Orlando, the question of
‘what would you do if you
woke up as the opposite
gender?’ has captivated
many around the world. It’s
this question that Swedish
director Alexandra-Therese
Keining attempts to answer
in her latest film Girls Lost,
which centres around three
young girls drawn together
by their shared creativity and
kept together through social
isolation. Kim (Tuva Jagell),
Bella (Wilma Holmén), and
Momo (Louise Nyvall) are
all misfits, facing regular
misogynistic and homophobic
abuse at school. With little
support from their families,
they turn to each other for
solace. However, when
they grow a strange plant
whose fruit allows them to
experience life as boys, their
group begins to fragment.
On the surface, the divi-
sions that crop up are related
to the increasingly danger-
ous activities of Kim, who
falls in love with local rebel
Tony (Mandus Berg), and his
group of delinquents. Seen in
this way, it’s a classic tale of
peer-pressure and adolescent
aspiration to conform (albeit
through nonconformity), and
doesn’t seem to add much
to the genre. Indeed, Girls
Lost ticks every box that is
required today of a Euro-
pean coming-of-age drama:
squat parties in abandoned
industrial complexes; a shot
of someone silently screaming
underwater; there’s even a
couple of daybreak rooftop
scenes thrown in for good
measure.
However, what sets this
film apart from others is the
decision to tackle transgender
issues, particularly how trans
adolescents feel at a period By Fred Fyles
T
om Kingsley and
Will Sharpe follow
up their delightfully-
dark 2011 debut
Black Pond with The
Darkest Universe,
a film that serves as both a
subtle reminder about the
intimacy of family relations
and a stunning advertisement
for the UK’s canal network.
Sharpe stars as Zac, a city
banker whose already-diffi-
cult life is turned upside-down
by the disappearance of his
sister Alice (Tiani Ghosh),
refusing to find herself a job
or do any of the washing-up.
Zac and his long-term
girlfriend Eva (Sophia di
Martino) attempt to change
things, first moving her into
the houseboat, and then
getting her to look after Eva’s
grandma. But once Alice actu-
ally gets up and goes, a hole
opens up in Zac’s existence,
and he is driven to the brink
in an attempt to find her.
With this set-up, it seems like
The Darkest Universe would
be a depressingly bleak,
Mike Leigh-esque exploration
of London life, but the film is
surprisingly upbeat. As Zac
begins to crack up, he pours
all his energy into creating
a campaign to find Alice,
focusing on fancy websites
and a regular video-blog in
which he obsessively attempts
to remain upbeat. These sec-
tions, his ‘postcards from the
canal’, are the most effective
in the film, allowing humour
to cut through all of Zac’s
nervous desperation.
While I loathe to use this
word – which, in the run

has become more and more
toxic – there’s something
unmistakably ‘British’ about
The Darkest Universe. Not
in a Carry On, kitsch kind of
way, but rather how it reflects
the subtle nuances of the
emotional and cultural life of
the UK. For me, the closest
resemblance to The Darkest
Universe was Ben Wheatley’s
Sightseers, which also took
a sideways look at modern
British life through the guise of
a tour of the countryside, with
all its subtle menace.
With The Darkest Universe,
Sharpe and Kingsley have
created a delicate, fine film,
one that floats along with
a zephyr-like lightness. Its
strong cast, led by Sharpe,
help communicate the
strength of family ties and
the crushing impact of loss in
a way that is insightful, but
never too heavy. The Darkest
Universe is a hidden gem, one
that deserves to be uncovered
and shared.

of immense physical and
psychological change. Kim
is immediately more seduced
by the idea of acting out her
fantasies of being a boy,
simply because for her they
are more than mere fantasies.
While Momo and Bella are
playing a social role, Kim
is discovering an explana-
tion for why they’ve felt so
trapped.
In this way, Girls Lost reads
like a combination between
the heartfelt exploration of
true Swedish life found in
Lukas Moodyson’s work and
the searing exploration of
gender politics undertaken
by Céline Sciamma. Girls
Lost doesn’t meet the heights
of either director’s work, but
Keining’s ability to capture
the fleeting magic of adoles-
cence, all twilight revelations
and shimmery electronica,
combined with the bold deci-
sion to take on gender issues
make Girls Lost one to watch.
