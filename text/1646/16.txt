The National
Theatre gets
its groove back
with Amadeus
T
he National’s
new revival of its
1979 triumph is
one tinged with
sadness, doubly
so on the evening
of its opening. The play-
wright behind Amadeus,
Peter Shaffer, sadly passed
away earlier this year, and
on the day of the opening
the director Howard Davies,
responsible for 30 shows at
the National over the past
few decades, also left us.
There is a pre-show appear-
ance by Rufus Norris and
Nick Hytner (present and
previous artistic directors of
the National) to pay tribute to
the two men, and there is an
undeniable air of melancholy
hanging over the building.
It’s an air that lends itself
well to Amadeus. This is the
story of Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart told through the eyes
of composer Antoni Salieri,
Mozart’s self-proclaimed
assassin. From his death-
bed, Salieri gives a warped
recollection, crying out to
the dead Amadeus, begging
for forgiveness, pleading for
mercy.
Adam Gillen, playing
Mozart, occasionally threat-
ens to overegg it early on.
The part as written is an infuri-
ating, childish brat of a young
man, so it’s an inherently
fine line to walk between
hitting the right notes,and just
putting everyone off. Early
on the performance threatens
to become overwhelm-
ing; Gillen is a ball
of frenetic energy,
limbs flying every-
where, his body
contorting itself
throughout his
hyperactive vocal delivery. If
maintained for the entire run
time, it’s a performance that
would rapidly get tiresome.
However, as the play goes
on, and Mozart crumbles
before us, Gillen emphatically
lands the pathos of a broken
man. It’s heartbreaking to
watch; the pain manages
Jack Steadman
to fill the enormous Olivier
Theatre – a feat of no small
amount of showmanship.
By contrast, Lucian Msa-
mati as Salieri is a model
of restraint. The role is less
overtly theatrical but none-
theless grabs the audience’s
attention. Msamati gives
a towering performance.
Salieri’s fear of mediocrity,
and the intolerable torment
he feels as he hears the music
of God coming from the pen
of a petulant child is made vis-
ceral in Msamati’s work. He
effortlessly nails Shaffer’s mix-
ture of comedy and tragedy;

by turns attracting, and
repulsing the audiences, he
subtly steals the show without
anyone noticing. It’s only in
the play’s final moments, with
Mozart out of the way, that
you realise what’s been in
front of you all along. Gillen
makes a valiant attempt, but
this is Msamati’s show.
The performances are
aided wonderfully by Chloe
Lamford’s stage design, and
Jon Clark’s unobtrusive light-
ing which mesh beautifully
with the play’s themes. It’s all
inescapably theatrical; the
lighting rigs over stage are
clearly visible, many of the
sets are simply frameworks
for what they represent;
curtains attached to bars are
neatly tucked away just so to
frame the action behind them.
The staging underscores the
show’s discussion of art and
artifice, while also neatly
complementing this retelling
of events by an unreliable
narrator; the dying Salieri.
Vast, and bombastic in
every conceivable way (it
has a full orchestra in it!),
Amadeus still manages to
be deeply connecting, and
painfully human. It is at once
a celebration and a revitalis-
ing of Shaffer’s masterpiece;
by turning to a past success,
the National seems to have
re-discovered just what they
can achieve. Critically, It’s
been a rocky road for Rufus
Norris’ tenure thus far (per-
haps undeservedly so), but
any memories of the under-
whelming wonder.land or the
lifeless The Plough and the
Stars are wiped away by
Amadeus. Mediocre no
more, the National is
back.

We Need to
Talk About
Kevin I seated
myself in the
packed Young
Vic theatre with considerable
foreboding. All I knew of The
Nest, Franz Xaver Kroetz’
parable with an ecological
warning, was that it involved
a great tragedy becoming
two young parents. I quickly
realised that my assumptions
had been partly wrong,
unlike Lionel Shirver’s portrait
of a psychopath, there is no
evil child here, or at least not
an ostensible one, instead the
demon lurks in poverty and
the exploitation of labour.
Conor McPherson’s new
translation from the original
German transports the trag-
edy to Ireland. The characters
remain the same, the optimis-
tic father, a long haul trucker;
the beleaguered mother
reluctantly off on maternity
leave, earning a desperate
pittance cold-calling for
a bank. Obsession with
money permeates their
lives and their relation-
ship. “Having a baby
isn’t going to be
cheap you know!”,
the truism echoes
through the thin
walls of their home.
The set design
was the aspect I
liked most about this
piece. The flat in which
the play is set feels like an
abandoned IKEA warehouse,
deplete of all but the basic
necessities. It’s sparse, and
frugal; the sofa is also the
bed. As the audience, we
watch through the roof, as if
we are voyeurs in a new dark
expansion to The Sims. The
outside world is no less omi-
nous, shaded in the greys of
a David Firth cartoon: rusty
iron foundations jut outward
over a polluted lake.
This sinister atmosphere
is compounded by the
electronic music of P J
Harvey which at times was
reminiscent of the elec-
tro-funk in the Midnight Run
soundtrack, and at times was
distorted and aggressive and
could have belonged on a
Nine Inch Nails album. The
incongruence is effective. It
generates a surreal tone, the
kind we get in a dream where
things don’t fit together prop-
erly and we know something
must go wrong.
Go wrong it does, but not
in the way the director Ian
Rickinson perhaps intended.
In the second half, the play
collapses in a paroxysm of
physical theatre and shouting
that is almost unwatchable.
The main issue, to regurgi-
tate my previous analogy,
is that the relationship
between the parents is
about as believable as the
affairs of two Sims, arguing

The Nest
overeggs
performances to
give an uneven
show
about showerheads, empty
fridges and puddles on the
floor. Caricatures don’t make
interesting characters. The
only impression I got about
the parents was that the
father worked too much and
the mother was too worried
about money. Their dialogue
was accordingly dull and
although there were rare
moments of black comedy -
the father’s defiant “there is
a lot more to life than mental
health” received the biggest
laugh – even the jokes felt
trite. Here lies the crux of the
problem with The Nest. If you
don’t believe the characters
then the play’s climactic trag-
edy, in which the newborn is
unknowingly bathed by his
mother in a lake full of toxic
waste, becomes unbeara-
ble to watch. The mother’s
hysteria feels contrived. The
father’s mea culpa descends
into a tedious ten minute pan-
tomime of wailing and hand
wringing. There is nothing
more boring for an audience
than to feel apathy while
actors on stage enjoy having
emotions. Paring down the
manufactured drama might
have served the The Nest
better; less is more. Like the
stricken child of The Nest,
this performance might have
been resuscitated if only the
director had understood this.
Yet the play is not a com-
plete failure, and however
histrionic The Nest may be,
the moral lesson is not lost.
Poverty is a rough beast, it
drives us to danger-
ous and irrational
decisions. It drives
us to exploit the
world around
us, and make
no mistake,
whatever harm
we do to the
environment in
our lives will be
reciprocated
tenfold against
generations to
come.
