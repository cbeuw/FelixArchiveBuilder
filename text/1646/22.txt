How you use it
Ketamine comes in the form of a crys-
talline powder. When doing research
for this article, it was also suggested
to me it is possible to inject, however
I have never seen nor heard of this
happening in real life. When sniffing
any form of drug, the effects are almost
instantaneous.
When sniffing, please ensure all crystals
are crushed. This will not only ensure
that your nose doesn’t encounter sear-
ing pain this Friday, but will also relieve
you of the torment of pissing out crys-
tals. The pain which is only comparable
to that feeling encountered when you
realise Trump has won the election.
Legality
“On June 10th
2014, Ketamine changed from a class C to a class B controlled
drug. This means that possession of Ketamine could now get you up to five years
in jail and an unlimited fine, while supplying Ketamine to someone else could get
you up to 14 years in jail and an unlimited fine.” This is official government policy.
However, in real life, if caught with Ketamine for the first time you are more likely
to simply receive a caution (or a reprimand if you’re under 18). Something akin to
a slap on the wrist from the police.
Things to do when you’re high
Do
• Chill out with your friends
and watch a film, although
no horrors if you’re tripping!
• Embrace the effects – don’t
worry, you’ll be fine in an
hour.
• Make sure you’re in an envi-
ronment you’re comfortable
with.
Don’t
• Feel peer pressured – if you
don’t want it, DON’T DO IT!
• Take with an upper (Cocaine,
MDMA etc.) unless you know
what you’re doing. Speed-
balling anyone?
• Take before any important
task. I shit you not, I knew
someone who went to an
interview after taking keta-
mine. Needless to say they
didn’t get the job.
What it does
Ketamine, put simply, is a general
anaesthetic. Whilst infrequently admin-
istered to humans, it is more commonly
used when operating on animals, pre-
dominantly horses. That’s right boys and
girls, sniffing Ketamine is not dissimilar
to taking the drugs required to sedate a
horse.
The effects don’t last long, normally 30
to 50 minutes depending on the strength
and quality of the drug. Effects include; a
reduction in senses likened to drunken-
ness, a change in perception of your
sight and hearing (more commonly called
‘tripping’) and the loss of the ability to
speak in a manner which others humans
can understand.
Some statistics
According to Home Office’s “Drug Misuse: Findings from the 2014/15
Crime Survey for England and Wales – Second edition” (doesn’t it
have a fancy name for something so dull?), Ketamine use amongst 16
to 24 years olds is decreasing. With “Proportion of adults (16 – 24)
reporting use” standing at 1.6%. Whilst that may appear paltry I’d
wager there’s a substantial number out there not reporting use – I
mean why would you?

Glossary
Tripping / Trips – When your perceptions alter, allowing
you to experience hallucinations.
Ket Hole / K Hole – A state encountered when you take
large amounts of (good quality) Ketamine. To people
around you, you will appear unresponsive, however you
will be experiencing some shit hot trips.
Racking up / Cutting up – To form your Ketamine in to
lines. Normally lines are formed on CD/DVD cases, if
anyone still owns those anymore.
Line – Quite literally a line of Ketamine. Lines come in
various sizes, from 0.1 gram (small) to gram lines if you’re
a professional.
Key – Quite literally Ketamine on a key (for example a
house key). Prepared by simply inserting a key in to your
trusty bag of Ketamine, keys are naturally smaller than
lines. Keys are often used instead of lines due to a reduced
amount of preparation required, it is not exactly conven-
ient to start racking up your Ketamine in 568 is it?
The politics of pubes – how much is too much?
Although being completely
devoid of pubic hair runs the
risk of making you look like
a prepubescent, the way that
we consume porn has often
make it the expectation, par-
ticularly for women. For girls
these days, this is something
that starts as soon as the
little curlies start sprouting,
a contrast to a decade ago
where removal of public hair
beyond a bikini line trim was
an alien concept to teenagers
and seen only in Sex and the
City.
But the times seem to be
changing, with various fash-
ion magazines declaring this
H
ave you ever felt
like someone
was judging
your pubes?
Most of us have
felt under some
pressure to neaten up, groom,
or man-scape our bits, but is
this a social expectation that
we place on ourselves, or do
other people actually care
about how well maintained
we are down there?
When it comes to having
sex, no one likes hair in their
teeth, but it kind of comes
with the territory. I think most
people with a regular partner
feel that some level of hair
is certainly worth putting up
with if it means getting to
drop the hair removal routine.
But while just about everyone
agrees that it’s “polite” and
“considerate” to trim, many
people feel an extraordinary
amount of pressure to remove
all traces of these tufty curls.
year that the “freedom bush”
is back in fashion. Actually,
when people say “the bush
is back”, what they mean is
that now people want all hair
removed from a woman’s
genitals, apart from a patch
at the top that makes your
minge look somewhat akin
to Donald Trump’s toupee,
which is supposed to be
artfully groomed so that it
doesn’t look groomed at all.
Of course, women naturally
have a lot more hair than
that, and this is actually even
more effort than asking us to
go completely bare.
But it’s more cleaner, right?
Aside from wanting to feel
sexier, the main reason that
people give for wanting to,
and expecting their partners
to be clean shaven, or at least
neat and tidy, is hygiene. But
even that is a misconception
– pubic hair is there to protect
the delicate skin of genitals
from friction, and the micro-
scopic wounds created by
all methods of hair removal
create a breeding ground
for all sorts of bacteria and
assists transmission of STIs.
Really, are the stubble and
ingrown hairs worth it? A
pubic mound that strongly
resembles a recently-plucked
chicken is not a happy
mound. It’s entirely your busi-
ness what you do with your
pubic hair; if it makes you
feel sexy to know that no one
will see the hairs in your butt
crack when they’re ploughing
you from behind, then more
power to you.
But one thing that I’ve learnt
is that everyone has pubic
hair, and as long as it’s not
matted and smelly, it’s not
going to be a deal breaker.
If you’re spending time every
day in the shower twisting
awkwardly trying to keep
your undercarriage stubble
free because you think that
is what is expected of you,
maybe try giving it a break
for a while and see what
happens.
Yes, there is unfortunately
some social expectation, and
maybe some people will be
surprised – for all the 19 year
olds I’ve slept with who’ve
never seen pubes before –
but when it comes to getting
down, they probably won’t
mind, and they might even
like it. And so might you.
If you’re experimenting with sporting a hairy muff, here are some hairstyles you might like to try.
Minimal attention required. A
good style choice when you
have coursework deadlines
coming up.
Or the Boyzilian. A solid
choice if you think that
anyone heading down there
needs directions.
THE BUSH THE LANDING STRIP
Good if you want an excuse
for that cheesey smell. A
surprisingly high-maintenance
version of the original.
THE DORITO THE MOUSTACHE THE DONALD TRUMP
Best worn during Movember
or when on Erasmus in
France. Perfect if you fondly
call your junk Hercule.
Ideal for blondes. You can
comb this so that it covers up
your carefully constructed
bald bits.
