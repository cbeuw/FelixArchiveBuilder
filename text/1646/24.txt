I
have now been married
for three wonderful
months, and even though
I may be the man of
the house I can happily
say my wife has a more
proficient history in sport
than I. Do note the lack of
shame. I have no beef with
such a statement. I am proud
to talk about her previous
achievements and will
continue to be, even when
our future children ask why
I always lose during games
night. Again, not in a ‘this is
unusual’ way, in a perfectly
normal, proud-husband
manner.
We are here to talk about
Imperial Girls Can. Last week,
Sport Imperial hosted a
successful five days of events
with the aim of getting women
more involved in sport.
Sessions included tag rugby,
tennis and Halloween-themed
exercise classes; sessions
aimed at the right target
audience and reportedly
enjoyed by all that attended.
There did seem to be a limited
amount you could choose to
do, some even suggesting an
element of sexism in those
advertised. I can emphasise
to a certain extent, with a
much heavier emphasis on
fitness classes than sport. But
let’s explore this more.
Does that opinion not seem
a tad extreme? Bringing
sexism into this suggests an
insulting selection of classes
whose sole aim is to pander
to women, condescendingly
making them feel ‘involved’ in
club who said:
“We were not given the
opportunity to input on
when the event was, 1-2
on a Monday was largely
unsuitable as most people
have lectures, as such there
wasn’t an amazing turnout …
the way they publicize and
choose event times needs
re-thinking “
Very telling from two clubs
whose sports were among
the few included. The tennis
ladies inform me that most
of the ACC clubs had events
organised, but these simply
weren’t advertised to the level
of that seen for Imperial Girls
Can. On whose head this
lies is not for me to say, but it
should be addressed in future
events.
Time to deliver on the
pleasant surprise I promised.
The organisation may have
been questionable, however I
get the impression the events
were enjoyable. In fact, I’m
told the tennis women who
attended other events had
a great time and even got
in touch with Sport Imperial
suggesting some be added to
the regular timetable. Again,
the rugby club agree with this
and enjoyed their session,
reporting that those who did
attend had a great time. If
these events were truly sexist
surely the atmosphere would
have been one of anger
and protest, not enjoyment?
The simple fact is that these
sports and classes are things
that women enjoy, just not
exclusively. Sport Imperial
only have limited resources
but it appears they delivered.
Both clubs actually expressed
disappointment that more
didn’t attend, and the two I’m
speaking to even inform me a
boy turned up (shock horror!).
But only the one, guess he
must have been lost …
In fact, he may well have
been. As a member of the
opposite sex, I did get the
impression the week was
for women only. At no point
was it made clear that men
were welcome to attend,
but as mentioned at the start
of this piece, shouldn’t it be
obvious? Equality means
your issue too”.
My interview with the tennis
duo moves onto their sport in
general, in order to try and
address this. I’m pleased to
hear the Lawn Tennis Club
has very commendable
female participation, but at
the social level there’s a hint
of masculinity that means they
actually organised a women’s
only event. Are men really
that intimidating? I certainly
don’t feel it when doing the
dishes in a fetching apron.
There is also an obvious
frustration that women’s tennis
is seen as a lower form of
sports quality compared to
that of men, a thought which
fans of hockey (Rio anyone?)
and football (sorry boys, the
female team have a much
better track record) should
know is simply not true.
I thank my guests for taking
the time to talk to me and I
thank you for reading this, but
I know nothing can be solved
with regards to sport equality
in an 800 word article. I want
to hear from all the clubs who
feel there is a lack of gender
equality, I want more events
based around addressing
male participation in female-
based sports (and vice versa)
and above all, I want my wife
to let me win for once.
a masculine world of sport as
if pleasing a temperamental
child. I disagree, but don’t
take my word for it, listen
to the opinions of those that
matter. This reporter decided
to go out and actually ask
those who took part, and you
may be surprised.
I had the pleasure of
speaking to the President and
Vice-President of the Lawn
Tennis club (both women I
hasten to add), who were
kind enough to spare a few
minutes before heading off
to one of the aforementioned
events. I began by enquiring
as to how Imperial Girls Can
was set up, organised and
advertised. It became clear
there was minimal, if any,
communication between
Sport Imperial and the ACC
clubs of Imperial College,
