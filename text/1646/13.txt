This week sees the release of
Arrival, a hot-ticket sci-fi film
with a female protagonist, which
follows quickly on the heels of
2013’s Gravity. But do these films
mark a breakthrough of the sci-fi
glass ceiling, asks Fred Fyles? Or
do they play into the tropes well
established in the genre?
A
round the
halfway point
of Denis
Villeneuve’s
latest sci-
fi thriller
Arrival, which touches down
this week, I found myself
questioning the circular
nature of time. But while the
film itself – with its focus on
language, neurology, and
chronology – does try and
upset our conventionally-
held notions of time (to say
any more would risk spoiling
it), my confusion was more
simply explained as a regular
case of déjà vu: haven’t we
already seen this before?
You see, what was brought
to my mind most of all while
watching Arrival was Alfonso
Cuarón’s 2013 film Gravity.
Like Arrival, Gravity was a
big-budget production – both
films were visually resplend-
ent, and I imagine Arrival
will pick up almost as many
award nominations as Gravity
did – but what struck me the
most was how in both films
a decision was made that is
rare in science fiction: both
had a woman as the central
protagonist. In Arrival, it’s
Amy Adams’ Dr. Louise Banks
who saves the day, a linguistic
expert who is tasked with
communicating with aliens
who land across the planet.
In Gravity, the stakes are a bit
lower – globally speaking –
as Sandra Bullock’s Dr. Ryan
Stone needs only to save her
own skin after a chain reac-
tion of debris peppers her
space-craft mid-flight.
The comparisons extend fur-
ther beyond gender politics
– Gravity and Arrival share a
sweeping soundtrack, a sense
of wonderment at human pro-
gress, and an overt distrust of
the Russians – but something
about the choice to cast
women in the centre of both
films seemed bold, daring
almost. It shouldn’t really,
and yet, even today, women
are rarely seen in cinematic
leading roles, particularly in
science fiction.
A study released earlier this
year from the Center for the
Study of Women in Television
and Film, a unit at San
Diego State University,
found that women
made up only 22%
of protagonists in
the top-grossing
films of 2015,
meaning male
protagonists out-
numbered them
by more than
3:1. Furthermore,
this represented
a recent historical
high: in 2014, only
12% of protagonists
were women, indicating
that – despite the wide-
spread calls of gender
equality in some sections of
the industry – Hollywood
lags far behind in terms of
critically scrutinised before
we claim it as a feminist
victory.
Firstly, it’s telling that
while both protagonists are
highly-trained academics,
neither work in what are
classically called the ‘hard
sciences’ – Banks is a world
expert in linguistics, which
is not counted among the
STEM subjects; Stone is
a biomedical engineer, a
field associated with the
life sciences, which are
disproportionately studied
by women. This might seem
like a small niggle, but it
highlights how rare it is to see
women occupy the roles tradi-
tionally associated with men,
such as physicists and math-
ematicians. Furthermore, in
Gravity, Stone’s character
is marked by her lack of
experience, and spends
much of the film flailing
around in space. It’s
a stark contrast to
George Clooney’s
character, a smooth
operator who easily
excels at space-walk-
ing, and has to help
Stone through the
more ‘difficult’ aspects
of space-travel.
However, the key prob-
lem is that neither Stone nor
Banks are allowed to have
a narrative that stands up
on its own two feet – they
both need a ‘hook’, as it
were, to elicit sympathy from
Women in sci-fi | A space oddity?
representation.
And thus, the huge success
of Gravity (which made close
to three quarters of a billion
dollars), and the presumed
success of Arrival, should
be more than welcome. But
things aren’t really all they
seem: to me, both Adams’
and Bullock’s characters
mark not a breakout surge
for the woman-led sci-fi film,
but instead a return to the
classical tropes surrounding
women in media. Rather than
something that should be
unquestionably lauded, the
portrayal of women in both
Gravity and Arrival should be
the viewer. While this is a
common occurrence in sci-
ence fiction (despite the huge
success of the Half-Life video
game series, studio execs
still need to be persuaded
that we can empathise with
‘normal’ scientist-cum-ci-
phers), in both Arrival and
Gravity the female leads
are cast in wholly maternal
roles. In Gravity, Stone has
lost her young daughter in an
accident; in Arrival, much the
same happens, with cancer
taking away Banks’ daughter
before her time. In both films,
this is about as far as it goes
in giving each character a
back-story, forcing both of
them into the role of the griev-
ing mother, who pours herself
into her work to make up for
their personal losses – in the
case of Arrival, this happens
in, quite literally, the first five
minutes. Neither character
is allowed to be simply a
scientist who is good at her
job; presumably the studio
executives believed that this
would be such an unengaging
character, so unnerving, that
a large dose of displaced
maternal instinct needs to
be injected in order to gain
the audience’s trust. At least
Cuarón had the good sense
to resist throwing in a love
story, which is more than can
be said for Arrival.
While this might strike some
as me looking for problems
where there aren’t any, I think

an instructive comparison
can be made between these
two films and The Martian,
Ridley Scott’s 2015 science
fiction comedy-cum-action
film. The Martian, like Gravity
and Arrival, focuses largely
on a single scientist (Matt
Damon), who needs to use all
his knowledge to overcome a
major issue. In the case of The
Martian, the problem is that
Damon’s character, Dr. Mark
Watney, has been stranded
on Mars when a mission
goes wrong. His solution? To
‘science the shit out of this’.
In many ways, these films are
quite similar, with the lone (or
near-lone) scientist going up
against insurmountable obsta-
cles, and triumphing thanks to
the ingenuity of humankind.
However, there is an
important difference, and
that is that Damon’s character
in The Martian is allowed
to stand alone, without his
narrative being bolstered
by the perceived need for
an emotional back-story.
Damon is free to blow stuff
up, dance around the space
module, and generally be a
free agent; there is no dying
child left behind on Earth,
no poignant moment of
communication with a spouse,
nothing – in essence – acting
as emotional baggage. In this
way, Damon’s character fulfils
the typical archetype of the
man alone in the wilderness,
a trope that dates all the way
back to Henry David Tho-
reau’s mid-19th
Century work
Walden, which espouses
independence from others
and a life of self-sufficiency.
In a controversial piece
written for the New Yorker
magazine, Kathryn Schulz
argues that Walden was ‘the
original cabin porn’, which
espouses ‘a fantasy about
escaping the entangle-
ments and responsibilities
of living among other
people’. While Watney is
able to eschew the duties
that accompany living with
others, Stone and Banks are
never afforded this luxury; as
women, they are bound by
a heavily-networked web of
interpersonal relationships
from which they cannot
escape. The fact that
producers of sci-
ence-fiction films
feel they cannot
divorce their
female protag-
onists from this
emotional mesh
speaks to the
deeply-ingrained
social roles that
women are expected
to fulfil: mothers; sisters;
daughters.
But hasn’t this always been
the case in science fiction?
Haven’t women always been
relegated to the side-lines?
Surely, with these films,
even if women are put in
reductive roles, at least
they are protagonists?
Well, the earliest history of
science fiction film is indeed
marked by a pronounced
lack of women characters.
Where they did feature, such
as in Le Voyage Dans La Lune
(1902) and Aelita: Queen of
Mars (1924), they were cast
as aliens – the most literal
representation of the ‘Other’
that you can get. Similarly, in
Metropolis, Fritz Lang’s 1927
master work, which set the
conventions for science fiction
cinema for the next century,
Brigitte Helm plays both the
socialist siren Maria and her
evil robot double. Neither
roles are particularly liber-
ating: Maria is the perfect
fräulein, a flawless mediator
between the workers (the
hands) and the ruling classes
(the head), while her robot
double is, naturally, com-
pletely dehumanised.
As we enter the swinging
sixties, things don’t get much
better. Stanley Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey, the
most important film in the
genre, is remarkably free of
pathogen whilst navigating
the male-dominated world
of hard-nosed science. We
then ended the decade with
Alien, that classic landmark
in both feminist film and
the science-fiction canon.
With the focus on the
alien itself, in all it’s H. R.
Giger-designed phallic
glory, Sigourney Weaver
was able to carve out the
role of Ripley, the warrant
officer on-board the attacked
ship. Not only does the
film, with its visuals of
grubs popping out
of chests, toy very
knowingly with
the male fear of
femininity and
pregnancy,
but the role of
Ripley punched
a hole in the
traditional por-
trayal of women
in science fiction.
Here was a female
protagonist who was tough,
hard-headed, and didn’t need
any man to save her. The
script initially had all the char-
acters down as male, but the
writers explicitly stated that
“the crew is unisex and
all parts are interchange-
able for men or women”.
Weaver embodied the role
in a way that didn’t draw
attention to her gender, and
director Ridley Scott didn’t
attempt to play up any mater-
nal instincts – the result was
a character that is inherently
feminist, an icon of power
and independence.
The next two decades after
Alien saw a number of sci-fi
films that toyed with the idea
of a female protagonist:
1986’s Aliens, which saw
Weaver return to the screen
to kick some alien butt yet
again; 1991’s Terminator
2, whose Sarah Connor
character can be seen as the
archetype of Mad Max: Fury
Road’s Furiosa; and 1997’s
Contact, in which Jodie
Foster plays a SETI scientist
whose discovery of an alien
message drives the film. Since
then, things seem to have
taken a step back, with films
like Ex Machina and Under
the Skin pushing women back
in the alien/android box, and
Spike Jonze’s Her relegating
the main female character to
an off-screen voice.
Looked at against this histor-
ical context, we can see that
the female characters at the
front of Arrival and Gravity
do not mark a new golden
age of women in sci-fi. While
it is welcome to see women
in front of the camera, they
are forced into roles that live
up to the old stereotypes of
women: they are mothers or
daughters first, and scientists
second. What science fiction
needs – indeed, what cinema
needs in general – are female
characters who are simply
allowed to be. Ones that we
are allowed to simply relate
to, as themselves, in all their
power and glory.
\\ In sci-fi, women
are still expected to
fulfill the social roles
of mothers, sisters,
and daughters \\
women characters, and in the
science fiction films that do
offer key roles for women,
they are often cast as mere
eye-candy, and little else.
Think back to the 1968 camp
classic Barbarella, which saw
Jane Fonda as the title role,
proudly holding up the image
of the female adventurer
who must wear impractical-
ly-skimpy outfits – a tradition
that continues to this very
day. Director Roger Vadim
spoke of his reluctance to
‘intellectualise’ the character,
and this shows: Barbarella
regularly adopts the role of
damsel in distress, and when
rescued offers to repay the
men who come to her aid
with athletic sex. For context,
this was a film released half a
decade after Betty Friedan’s
The Feminine Mystique.
It wasn’t really until the
1970s when women really
made their mark on sci-fi. The
decade kicked off with The
Andromeda Strain, which
saw Dr. Ruth Leavitt save the
world from an extraterrestrial
