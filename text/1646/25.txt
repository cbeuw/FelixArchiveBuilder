A
fter finishing
0-8 last year,
the Immortals
took to the
field against
the Kent
Falcons with a hunger to win.
The first half was sluggish
with the offence unable to
move the ball and a host
of conceded penalties. A
similar scene was seen across
the Falcons’ offence. The
Immortals were able to force
two turnovers: an interception
by Immortals’ rookie Aaron
‘The Geordie’ Wilson
(Offensive MVP) and a forced
fumble recovered by Harry ‘I
don’t like being called beefy
in felix’ Lawrence. A lapse
in concentration from the
Immortals allowed the Falcons
a touchdown and two-point
conversion. The score was 8-0
at half-time.
The Immortal’s offense took
to the field with renewed
vitality. Jason Patrick ‘Kill’em’
Kuilian (Overall MVP) led the
offense to a touchdown and
two-point conversion with
powerful runs and accurate
passes, bring the score to
8-8. The Immortals shut down
the Falcons’ offense with
strong tackling from William
‘Gonzo’ Ginzo (Defen-
sive MVP) and a beautiful
interception from breakout
rookie Henry ‘no-fly-zone’
Alston (Rookie Defensive
MVP). Unfortunately the Fal-
cons’ defense stayed strong,
and after a few drives it was

world cup. Sabre didn’t want
to miss out on this magnificent
performance and after +14
indicators for Will Moore
and Chris Erickson, stormed
to a 45-16 victory, giving an
overall score of 135-55.
Topping off a great week
for IC Fencing was Ailsa
Morrison who, at the week-
end, represented Scotland in
the women’s foil event of the
five Nations in Manchester.
Scotland finished 3rd
in the
event and 2nd
overall. Well
done everyone and keep up
the good work. Do or do not,
there is no try!
L
ast week the men’s 2s
descended on King’s
College for their third
match of the season.
The importance of
this match cannot be
underestimated: Imperial’s
pride was at stake after
the 1s narrowly lost to their
counterparts at King’s the
week before. Foil kicked
things off for the 2s, showing
our superiority by smashing
King’s with a score of 45-10.
Confident going into epee
(one fencer forced to use their
non-dominant hand), Imperial
won 45-38 after our final
fencer was subbed off until he
could find a weapon to fence
with. Victory was completed
with a 45-35 win in sabre,
putting the final score at 135-
83, keeping up the winning
margins for the men’s 2s
for yet another week and
propelling the team to the top
of their league. A mention
must go to Cosmin Badea,
who normally only fences foil
for the team and who was
called upon to fence all three
weapons. He stormed his way
through all his opponents and
was vital in our victory. What
a trooper!
The men’s 1s were fencing
that day against Kent,
looking for their second win
of the season after a close
win against Queen Mary 1s
130-125 and the aforemen-
tioned loss to King’s. After
relegation last year the team
were looking to bounce right
back up to the Premiership,
so every win is vital. Epee to
begin, and with the possibility
of double hits, getting a large
lead is challenging. However
Imperial fencers James
Odgers and Charles Morot
got +12 and +13 indicators
each (the best you can get
when constantly winning is
+15), leading to an epee
score of 45-16. Second up
was foil and after a win of
45-23 Imperial had already
won the match in similar
fashion to Germany against
Brazil in the 2014 football
the Falcons who managed to
get a touchdown with a lofty
throw and catch also gaining
the two-point conversion.
Changes to offense found
Aaron Wilson playing both
safety and wide receiver. The
duo Jason (QB) and Aaron
(WR) linked up for a long
passing touchdown, and with
a successful conversion the
game was again tied. The
Falcons’ defense held strong
even against strong running
from Jorge ‘HHHOOORR-
REEE-HHHEEEYYYY’ Ales
(Rookie Offensive MVP).
In the final two minutes
a fumble was recovered
by Imraj ‘no groin’ Singh,
putting the Immortals in
Falcons’ territory. Immortals
were unable to convert, and
the game was forced into
overtime.
The Immortals started with
the ball in overtime. With
strong running swallowed
up by the Falcons’ defense,
they went to the air in an
attempt to score, but to no
avail. The ball was turned
over to the Falcons’ offense,
with their powerful running
back and twin tight-end for-
mation against the fatigued
Immortals defense the
touchdown was conceded.
Final score 16-22.
A special mention is needed
for Henry Turner (Line
MVP), a player that proved
dependable even when
playing both ways, and out
of position – a testament to
the Immortal’s spirit. This may
not be the desired result,
but we strive ever forward.

The 1s came in 2nd
at this
event last year and were
looking to improve. The
pool games started well,
with convincing wins over
Essex, Cambridge and St
Mary’s and only one loss
to Herts 1s placing them 2nd
in their pool. dD struggled
going into the power pool
against UEA but found their
mojo, convincingly beating
UCL 9-3. An easy cross
against UCL 2s left the team
playing 3rd
placed Brunel – a
dangerous opponent. After a
convincing 9-5 win, Imperial
faced Herts 1s for a place in
the final. At the second time
of asking, dD didn’t quite
have enough to win, losing
8-6 and leaving the team
with a game for 3rd
against
old rivals Cambridge. This
was an intense game (as
expected), but Cambridge
are not the all-powerful side
they once were. Although
nerve-racking at times, the
team were able to pull out
a win, giving us one last
chance to claim a spot in
division one nationals.
This game was once again
against Herts 1s. dD were
determined not to make
it three losses in a row
and came out firing. With
unwavering sideline support
from dD2 and dD3, the
team put in six unanswered
points to take the lead. This
energy ultimately secured the
9-2 win at the third time of
asking and gave the team 2nd
overall, placing them in the
division one nationals next
month.
The 2s had a difficult
pool, with two first teams,
however they overcame
KCL 2s to finish 3rd. They
also performed well in
their power pool, defeating
Essex 2s and Cambridge 2s
on universe point well into
overtime. This meant that the
team held seed throughout
both pool and power-
pool stages – a fantastic
achievement.
The Sunday games started

T
his Sunday, IC tennis
sent forth social
players into the
world of competitive
tennis for the
first time. Our six
hopeful challengers ventured
to Roehampton, where they
would take on counterparts
from across West London
in a series of singles and
doubles matches. The
fledgling players showed no
fear in this new environment,
coming out on top in seven
of the ten games, winning
the tournament and proving
our dominance of the social
tennis scene. This competition,
the first of its kind, was an
incredible success, with
players enjoying music and
free food throughout the day.
Twice as many social tennis
players will compete again in
December at the University of
Brunel to defend their title.
quality of the higher placed
teams. Whilst they didn’t gain
a position, they hadn’t lost a
position either, giving them
a final game against UCL for
11th
overall. This was a very
close game, coming down to
a single score with the team
losing out 4-3 to finish 12th
.
Coming into the tournament
as a third team means there
is no pressure to perform and
is a great way for many of
our beginners to see what
good ultimate frisbee looks
like. The initial pool stages of
the tournament were always
going to be a steep learning
curve playing first teams with
more experienced players.
Despite this, the team kept on
improving and put in several
points each game. The round
robin bracket for 13th
-19th
was similar, but the team
really connected and played
commendably, eventually
finishing a respectable 18th
.
The team can look forward
to continual improvement
with both men’s and women’s
regionals on the horizon.
