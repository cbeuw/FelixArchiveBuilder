many politicians and

Senate.
But even as I try to rationalise
and predict what will happen
in the next couple of months,
I can’t help but feel guilty
that I’m typing this in Rome,
a city more than 4300 miles
away from my hometown of
Doylestown, Pennsylvania.
Minorities have historically
been dealt a worse hand
in my country’s history. The
most recent example of this
is the Dakota Access Pipeline
proposal through Native
American lands.
That’s why when I started
joking about deporting myself
if Trump wins, I eventually
realized how selfish that
R
ight before I
boarded my flight
from London
Stansted Airport
to travel to Rome
for a short trip, I
refreshed a Google search on
my iPhone. My screen read
the following: Hilary Clinton
with 215 electoral votes, and
Donald Trump with 244.
Hours later, as I was chatting
with two Londoners who were
taking the same train I was
to central Rome, one of them
said, “Donald Trump won the
election.” And here we are:
the day millions of Americans
have been fearing since the
Donald declared his run for
the White House on the 15th
June last year. Many of my
friends are shocked by the
news. And I am too. But let me
be clear: Trump is not the main
reason I am sickened by my
country. It’s the people who
voted him in.
by that idea for him to reach
the magic number of 270.
I could spend the rest
of this piece criticising
Trump for all the repulsive
actions he’s committed and
words he’s spoken since his
but lost where it counts — in
the Electoral College. This
election has been anything
but predictable, and Trump’s
victory fits that narrative
almost perfectly.
Clinton’s loss must be one of
the most mentally devastating
moments in her life. Many
polls showed she was the
favourite to win, and some
even suggested she would do
so comfortably. But did the
recent news about her email
scandal cost her? The FBI letter
that was released was short,
and answered few to none of
my questions about the new
developments.
Multiple reports indicate
that the Clinton Foundation
has been suspicious with
how it hands out money to
charities. Clinton also has
given speeches for Goldman
Sachs and other corporations
for hundreds of thousands of
dollars. Even if we didn’t see
the transcripts, how much is she
influenced by big business? It’s
a fair question to debate.
I write about Clinton’s faults
understanding that if someone
put a gun to my head, I would
pick her. But these are the
reasons that Trump supporters
couldn’t cross party lines and
vote for her — including one
of my best friends from back
home in the Philadelphia area.
There’s an old saying that
“The White House makes the
man.” I’m clinging to this idea,
that once Trump is sworn in
this January, Congress will
check him when he proposes
something infeasibly radical,
even though Republicans hold
a majority in the House and
The main sentiment Trump
appeared to display during
the past year and a half was
that he was not a politician, but
that he was anti-establishment,
and considerably self-financed
his own campaign. And
enough people were captured
300 million people?
This isn’t to say I would ever
want to be a politician. First
off, I’m simply not a strong
enough public speaker to fit
the bill. And more importantly,
I am certainly not smart
enough to be handling a lot of
the policy issues that drive the
future of this country.
But then again, I realize
politics should be about policy,
not mud slinging.
I’ll return to the United States
in December, and I won’t be
certain what the atmosphere
will be like. But I will come
back with the same mentality
of treating people with
respect, like my mother raised
me.
At the end of the day, I
do believe this country will
continue to be united, even
as divided as it currently
appears. Because despite
political differences with many
friends and colleagues, I —
and countless others — have
been able to step back and
re-evaluate what ideas and
policies we should implement
for those around us.
I just wish that so many
politicians and voters wouldn’t
treat the future of our country
like it’s a fucking game.
Northern
Ireland’s abortion
laws are outdated
and inhumane
\\ The current legislation

and I am not speaking

Michael Purdy discusses the archaic
abortion laws of Northern Ireland and
the obstacles in getting them changed
F
or generations the
gears of the political
systems in Northern
Ireland have been
oiled by religion.
Northern Irish
politicians have interweaved
their self-perceived concepts
of morality (determined
by their personal religious
beliefs) into the politics of the
country. The religious beliefs
of the country’s politicians
have profoundly affected the
passage of many pieces of
legislation through parliament,
which has lead to the isolation,
discrimination and, at times,
social persecution of those
who do not conform to these
beliefs. Laws surrounding
abortion are a prime example
of this.
from obtaining an abortion
if she is raped or, in the case
of fatal foetal abnormalities,
under punishment of a
maximum sentence of LIFE
imprisonment. Thus, the law
still exists from a time when
it was common for twelve-
year-old children to work 14-
hour days in cholera-infested
factories, and men were
legally allowed to beat their
wives with a stick (but only if it
was thinner than their thumb).
The act is by no means a
dormant piece of legislature.
This April a 21-year-old
woman from Belfast was given
a three month suspended
sentence for carrying out
a self-induced miscarriage
using pills she bought online.
This woman’s decision to
abort the pregnancy would
have been one of the most
emotionally and physically
tasking moments she had ever
experienced. For the rest of
her life, every time she applies
for an international visa, a
job, adoption application etc.
she must detail this conviction,
meaning it will plague her
indefinitely. Many women
in Northern Ireland who
decide to have an abortion
travel to England where it
is currently legal. This trip
costs on average £900, a
sum of money that is not light
heartedly expended in an
economically underdeveloped
country. Thus, the law actively
discriminates against working
class women who do not
have the money to travel to
England for an abortion and
are forced to have the child or
terminate the pregnancy by
illegal means. In November
2015 Belfast’s High court ruled
that Northern Ireland’s current
abortion law is incompatible
with international human
rights. Furthermore, an
to prevent a change in
legislation. This is not the first
time the party has opposed
a change in law that would
facilitate social equality. The
party’s founder Ian Paisley
led his party on a campaign
to ‘Save Ulster from Sodomy’,
claiming homosexual acts
were “a crime against God
and man and its practice is
a terrible step to the total
demoralisationofanycountry.”
This campaign intended to
prevent the decriminalisation
of homosexuality in Northern
Ireland.
The DUP, however, are
not solely to blame. The
Catholic dominated pro-life
group Precious life frequently
protest outside Belfast’s family
planning clinic. Typically
these protests revolve around
harassing and showing
extremely graphic images of
aborted foetuses to women
who are seeking advice about
undergoing a pregnancy
termination. The leader of
the group, Bernadette Smith,

has there been no
change in the last
155 years? \\
Amnesty International survey
stated that 3/5 people in
Northern Ireland agree that
the law should be changed
to include cases of foetal
abnormalities, incest and
rape. So why then has there
been no change in the last 155
years?
The largest political
party in Northern Ireland
is the Democratic Unionist
Party (DUP). The party is
and has historically been
controlled by evangelical and
fundamentalist Christians. The
party opposes any change to
the current laws surrounding
abortion and has a large
enough majority in parliament

The current legislation
surrounding abortion in
place in Northern Ireland is
anachronistic, and I am not
speaking figuratively. The
1861 Offences Against the
Person Act prevents a woman
class a movie called The Silent
Scream. This involved being
forced to watch grotesque
images of abortions from the
1980s obviously in an attempt
by the Catholic school to
ensure students associated
the procedure with feelings
of repulsion. Statistically
speaking there was a very
high chance that a girl in my
class at the time might have
had an abortion or might have
known someone very close to
them who would had one.
Nearly 5000 women in the
pastfiveyearshavetravelledto
Britain from Northern Ireland
to obtain an abortion. The
opposition believes that legal
changes will lead to a spike in
abortions, yet inevitably if a
woman desperately wants an
abortion in Northern Ireland
she will have one. All a
change in the current laws will
do is help protect the mental
and physical health of women
in crisis and prevent them from
being stigmatised by society
as a murderer for making an
incomprehensibly difficult
decision. Fundamentally,
the archaic legislation in
place inhibits one of the most
significant human rights.

currently has a restraining
order in place against her
which was filled by a former
Belfast MP (Dawn Purvis)
who supported a change in
the current laws surrounding
abortion. This was a result of
continuous and belligerent
harassment from the pro-life
campaigner.
The education system in
Northern Ireland is also
inseparably associated with
religion. The teachers actively
project their religious views
on the students. Whilst at
school I remember being
shown in religious education

days ago. I could also blame
his supporters for failing to
consider the dangers of those
actions and rhetoric.
But that ultimately doesn’t
matter. Our system decided he
will be the next leader of one
of the most powerful countries
in the world. Perhaps it’s fitting
that Clinton actually won the
popular vote in our country,

I didn’t fill out a ballot and
send it in, and that deserves
a fair amount of criticism. But
why were many Trump and
Clinton supporters so against
hearing criticism about their
candidates for the past year
and a half? Again, how are
voters acting like sports fans
when the issues at stake will
shape the future of more than
