CANCER
VIRGO
This week you’re the
two escapees from
Pentonville Prison. You
decide to go back
inside once you see how
fucked it all is in the
outside world.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you’re
the new Toblerone
and you’re a fucking
disgrace. End of.
This we – fuck it, we’re
not gonna live past this
week anyway so what
does it fucking matter?
This week you’re the
dog in the John Lewis
advert. The foxes
and badger are your
friends at ‘normal’
universities. Look at
how much fun they’re
having.
This week you get called
a gutter journalist. Pat
yourself on the back
cause gurl, you’re doing
your job right.
This week the US
Election is finally over
but you don’t want to
know who won. Like
everyone, you skip
the rest of the paper
and just read the
horoscopes. Spoiler:
Nobody won, we all
lost.
This week you rush
your Italian coursework
because it’s for horizons
and nobody really cares
about your grade. You
hit up Google Translate
for your essay and
accidentally proposition
your 55 year old Italian
teacher. That essay got
you an A+.
This week you get
upset because someone
took your quotes out of
context and put them
into the wider context
that is reality.
This week you pull
out into traffic. You
should probably
choose a better place
to have sex.
This week the library
opens both doors in the
same day but refuses
to have both open at
the same time. SORT IT
OUT LIBRARY. MY NINE
GRAND DESERVES TO
HAVE BOTH DOORS
OPEN. STOP YOUR
FICKLE GAMES.
This week you watch
Planet Earth 2. There
haven’t been that many
snakes in one place since
Freshers Ball.
This week you find
Imperial’s secret hat
room. Find it and you
can join the inner
sanctum. Join us. Join
us. Join us.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I need your help! My bank balance is suffering! I can’t
stop online shopping. There is nothing more soothing
than looking at pretty clothes all day, it has become my
safety blanket. Nothing compares to the thrill of the parcel
coming through the door – it’s like Christmas when I was
seven but Father Christmas gets it right! Nothing gets my
adrenaline running like ripping through the patterned
plastic and watching it pile up in the doorway. It’s a beau-
tiful sight, until I realise I can’t recycle any of it and I’m left
with hoards of poor-quality clothing and a chasm where
my student loan used to be. What do I do? How do I stop
myself?
Yours,
Zara
Hey Zara!
Oh Boohoo, can’t you see that things could
be so much worse? If you enjoy what you’re
doing Just Do It! You aren’t doing anything
massively wrong or Missguided. If it helps you
to be Glamourous and get a New Look, you
should go for it! We all need something to help
us get through the day in the Office. Think of
it like this: The Gap in your wallet is fuelling
the wonderful system our society is based on.
As for recycling, just forget it, the world is no
Oasis and you’d be naïve to treat it so. We dig
up the ground for Diesel and shove the waste
back in.
HOROSCOPES
This is just how the world works; the wheels
keep spinning and Vans keep on driving.
Everywhere is like this – from the Midlands
to the Coast. Trying to act like the Converse
is true will only harm yourself. Sure, it isn’t
exactly sustainable, but it’s not like you won’t
be able to get an Apple because you made an
order. Any supposed effects are just conjecture
anyway, it’s not like, proved or anything, more
just a Guess. If you want to Accessorize, then
go for it. There’s no point trying to stop yourself
just Cos. We aren’t Allsaints.
Much love
Chris xxxxx
