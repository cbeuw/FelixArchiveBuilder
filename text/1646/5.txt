I was in the
Bataclan \\ This past year has been
emotional and at times very
difficult \\
Ollie Kemsley talks about the day of
the Paris attack last November, and his
experiences in the year following
I
was inside Bataclan when the attack
happened. At around 9:45pm there
was the sound of something like
firecrackers coming from the back of
the hall. The band stopped, all of the
lights came on suddenly, I looked over
my shoulder and, to my horror, I could see
three figures with machine guns blocking
the exits. Immediately the three terrorists
began shooting indiscriminately with their
kalashnikovs, and people fell to the floor
in a domino effect. After several seconds
of sustained shooting, there was an eerie
silence and I took the opportunity to
scramble towards a door in the distance
next to the stage. In those few seconds
of silence following the shooting, as the
terrorists reloaded their machine guns,
many people remained laying on the
floor and elsewhere there was panicked
shuffling. When the shooting began again,
I dropped flat to the floor and waited for
them to finish their round before attempting
to make an escape. This happened several
times.
Reaching the door, it turned out to be
locked (with a keycode adjacent to it).
There was a security guard standing
next to it. I was shouting at him to open
the door as we piled towards it and the
gunman continued shooting from behind,
and I remember he looked at me totally
blankly and then looked back towards
the shooters. He seemed frozen by
fear. Falling back on the floor, when the
shooting subsided again, I looked up and
the door was now open. It led into an
internal stairwell.
I was knocked to the floor in the doorway
by people pushing me from behind. I was
getting trampled on by people trying to
escape, literally stamping on me in blind
panic, and I really thought I was going to
get trampled to death. I desperately pulled
my legs from under the weight of bodies
by sliding myself along the floor, managed
to slip out of one of my trainers where my
foot was trapped, and somehow managed
to get up.
I ran a couple of flights of stairs, and
then came to a stationary group of people
on the 3rd
floor, one flight from the top.
People continued to flood up behind me,
and for a moment there was some horrible
crushing in the very narrow stairwell. With
no fire exit at the top of the stairs, my heart
sank. Suddenly, there was a really loud
explosion from below which literally shook
the building, and some smoke appeared
from below. I could not see any way out at
this point and was accepting that we may
all die.
There was, however, a skylight window
in the ceiling of the stairwell that we
managed to get the bars off, and started
filling out up through the window onto the
roof. It took some time, but everyone was
incredibly calm, and waited their turn. I let
a couple of women go in front of me, and
helped another person who was struggling
to get up. Shooting continued from below.
Once on the roof, there was a man
pulling survivors through a window of his
apartment on the 3rd
floor. Around 70 of
us stayed there in his living room, trapped
and hidden in near complete darkness.
We were up there for around three hours,
with no idea what was happening below.
There were multiple loud explosions which
made the room vibrate, and further bursts
of gunfire. We remained in almost total
silence, only the occasional whisper. It was
frightening, not knowing if the terrorists
would find us at any moment.
At around 1am there was loud banging
on the window of the apartment. There
was a collective groan from within, and
we all sunk even lower onto the floor and
under chairs, as we dreaded the
possibility that we had finally been
discovered by the terrorists. My
heartbeat increased back to levels
similar to when I was being shot at
three hours earlier. The door burst
open and it turned out, to our relief,
to be the special forces rescue
team. We were made to stand up
with our hands behind our heads,
lift our tops to show we didn’t have
suicide belts on, and then filter out
slowly in single file to street level.
Negative symptoms kicked in
several weeks after the attack. My
sleep became heavily disrupted,
and I’d wake up suddenly at 3am
unable to get back to sleep night
after night. Simple day to day
activities became a total slog under
these conditions, and my mood and
energy hit rock bottom. Over time,
this turned into a feeling of total
and utter hopelessness about ever
regaining any sort of normality in
my life, and a palpable sense of
isolation. This was compounded by
an overarching sense that I wasn’t
doing the right things to recover,
and the myriad of well-intentioned
but widely differing advice from
others on what I should or shouldn’t
be doing to aid recovery only
intensified the feeling of uncertainty.
On one of those sleepless nights
back in January, I suddenly felt
an urgent compulsion to properly
meet my father for the first time. I
had spent a significant amount of
time tracing him when I was 19,
met him very briefly when I was 23
and had been in email contact with
him since then over the following
seven years. Until that meeting, he
had not even known I existed. So
I emailed him and told him I was
coming to the States to visit. Less
than a week later, I was on a plane
to Arizona, and ended up spending
the majority of ten days with him.
It was a wholly surreal experience,
but a positive one and a crucial one
to have at that time. The decision to
go was led from compulsion rather
than prolonged reason, and that
felt good.
On my father’s side, I managed
to find out that my ancestors came
from Santander, northern Spain.
This was uncanny as I had elected
to study there on Erasmus in 3rd
year
of university, not knowing that many
generations of my ancestors had
lived in the same streets all those
years ago.
Later in the year, I decided
to find where my maternal
grandfather was buried and see
if my grandmother was still alive,
having no recollection of meeting
them. Several days of investigation
informed me that my grandfather
had been cremated but not yet
interred, and my grandmother
had passed away, too. I traced the
address of my maternal aunt, who I
had also never met, and since then
I have met one of my two cousins.
I didn’t even know I had cousins
previously.
In May, I had to go back to Paris
to attend the investigation hearing
put on for all victims of the attacks.
With some free time before the
hearing, I decided to go for an
impromptu jog. Running through
Eastern Paris, along the canal of
Saint Martin, I continued through
the edges of the city and just kept
running. When I got back to the

apartment, I had done 22km – well
over double anything I had ever
run before. That was the seed of the
idea for running my first marathon
in the months to come.
After a meal with friends on my
second evening in Paris, I went
back to the Bataclan. Arriving just
after midnight, the building was
half covered in scaffolding and so
quite hard to recognise from the
same side of the street. I crossed the
street to get a better look. Scanning
the front of the building, I looked
up to locate the apartment I had
been hiding in that night. And to my
surprise, there was one set of lights
on the building – that apartment. I
had been told that everyone had
vacated the apartments above the
concert hall after the attack, but
this bolstered my hopes to find the
person who had let me into his
apartment and truly thank him.
Returning at a more acceptable
hour the following day, I pressed
the buzzer to his apartment several
times, but no one answered. Yet I
had a sense that someone might be
up there, and had no other options,
so hung about by the building’s
door. After about 15 minutes a
woman came to the door from the
street, and I snuck in behind her.
I got to the door I guessed would
belong to the apartment from that
night, knocked and a man in his
20s answered. I explained who
I was, and he welcomed me in.
He, his girlfriend and I ended up
chatting for several hours about
that night and our experiences
since. The apartment was just as
I remembered it, which surprised
me. I thought that perhaps the
heightened emotions of that night
might have warped my sense of
space, especially in near darkness.
Since meeting the person who
saved around 60 lives, including
my own, through his selfless act, I
have nominated him for a bravery
award and attempted to get him the
compensation he deserves.
I went to my first concert since
being at the Bataclan in May in
Hamburg. It felt flat. Apart from
scanning the room for exits, and
being more aware and watchful
of what was going on around me
rather than what was on the stage,
my behaviour had not changed
\\ After a meal with my

significantly from before the attacks. But
the feeling and response to something I
had previously enjoyed – live music – had
changed.
I started to think that nothing would ever
match the adrenaline, the sheer intense,
animalistic, nature of those hours during
and after the attack. Looking back, those
few minutes in direct line of fire were the
only truly instinctive moments of my life.
I sometimes wonder whether I was just
sleepwalking through life before then,
and whether anything in my life will
ever measure anywhere near the level of
emotion and intensity of that experience.
I flew to Nice on Wednesday 14th
July, and the horrific truck attack on the
Promenade des Anglais happened the
next day. Flying back to the UK the day
after that, and over the following weeks
in which there seemed to be a spate of
terrorist attacks in France and Germany,
I wondered whether this was becoming
the new norm. Whether the frequency,
and perhaps scale, of these attacks was
to become regular and severe. Whether
society might just become accustomed,
perhaps even desensitised, to such attacks.
I wondered whether we needed to start
training people in what to do in a terrorist
attack situation and what that would
involve. What struck me on the night
was that our theories about life or death
situations,our‘fightorflight’instinctkicking
in, just didn’t seem to hold up. The majority
of people appeared to neither fight (near
impossible given the situation) nor attempt
to escape, but rather froze with fear. And
why wouldn’t they? The situation was so
far removed, so detached, from anything
that the vast majority of people attending
the concert would have ever experienced
or could have been prepared for.
Locating and contacting estranged
family, solving answers to long-unknown
family mysteries, finding the owner of
the apartment to thank him and get him
the recognition and support he deserves,
taking up new pastimes, writing; these
conscious acts have all been an attempt
to make positive changes after the horror
of that experience last November, and I
suppose to an extent a way of healing.
The culmination of these positive acts is
the idea of running the original marathon
on the one year anniversary of the attacks
in memory of the people who were killed
that night.
So this Sunday, on the one year
anniversary of the attacks, I will be taking
on the Athens Marathon in memory of
those who lost their lives. I am raising
money for RedR, an international disaster
relief charity.
Completing the marathon is my way of
doing something positive out of something
so awful. This past year has been emotional
and at times very difficult, and taking up
long-distance running has been a massive
help to me in terms of recovering and
keeping active and positive.

hugely appreciated not only by me but
by my charity as well. To donate towards
