he IC third XV
faced the medics
at the fortress of
Harlington, hoping
to follow in the
footsteps of the
varsity whitewash last year.
Falling on the same day as the
much-anticipated RVC night,
this game could very well
go down as one of the most
important of the season for
the 3s.
A win was imperative. The
pre-game team run-through
was cohesive and the pre-
match speech electrifying,
thanks to ex-boy scout and
rapid eyebrow-grower
captain Morgan Ball. The
game got underway with Ball
sending his namesake up high
deep into the Medic’s half.
A strong performance from
IC’s forwards turned the ball
over in a ruck. After stringing
together several phases the
ball was shipped out to the
backs where an overlap
saw fresher, and recently-
turned animal enthusiast,
Tom Berrige score his first try
for IC. With no space on the
preseason kicking program
due to there not being one,
Giustinuainaiai’s (spelling
confirmed) kick went amiss.
IC dominated the minutes
following the first try.
Impressive forward rotation
and steaming runs from
Harry ‘Payne Train’ Payne
saw momentum build in
IC’s favor. With the Medics
on their heels, scrum half
Takemasu kicked to gain
ground. Spanish Jean, keen
on spreading his culture
overseas, chased down
the ball and proceeded to
ram his horn-like shoulders
into the skinny matador
that was the Medics’ full
back. A penalty followed
by a lineout maul saw the
forward pack march over
the try line for the second try
of the game. Once again,
due to the aforementioned
circumstances, the kick
simply couldn’t be converted.
Now into the double digits,
IC’s minds drifted from the
field and complacency
crept in. Soon the Medics
were awarded a penalty
five metres from IC’s yet-
to-be-grazed try line. A
quick pick-and-go saw their
number eight cut through the
line to score the wettest try
of the game. The confidence
built up over the first half was
now gone. The score stood
10-7 to IC at the break.
The second half saw both
teams make several unforced
errors, resulting in a scrappy

are the university’s
cheerleading team. The
club is entering its 6th
year
of competition, with silver
medals under our belt
from last year’s nationals, and
we need your support to go
for gold.
Cheerleading is one of the
fastest growing sports in the
UK, combining stunts, gym-
nastics and, of course, dance.
Our team of boys and girls
work tirelessly throughout the
year to put on flawless rou-
tines, which are performed at
competitions against univer-
sity and semi-professionals
from across the country. The
Titans have seen a revolution
over the past two years, with
the appointment of an all-star
coach who has previously
represented England at the
World Championships. Ever
since, we have consistently
placed in the top three at
nationals, bringing home
bronze at Level two and
silver at Level one. This year
we hope to compete at a
larger event and improve our
standing amongst Level two
teams. This involves greater
gymnastics skills and more
advanced stunts, such as
having the flyer on one foot
and held at extension (over
the bases’ heads).
Our annual fundraiser, Save
The Cheerleader, provides
vital financial support for
the team. Members can
then take part in elite level
events without breaking
the bank. Cheer is all about
showmanship, which comes at
a cost. Tailor-made uniforms
and kit, as well as entry fees,
are well beyond the average
students financial capabilities
and so we are appealing
to you for help. Save The
Cheerleader is a great night
to show your support and
have a fantastic time with the
team, who have been work-
ing hard to kickstart the new
season and would love to see
a massive turnout! So head
over to Embargos on Wednes-
day 16th
after sports night,
to support the cheerleaders
while enjoying fantastic
drinks deals (2-4-1 cocktails
and £2.50 beers!) and the
company of our lovely team!

initial ten minutes. It was
within this scrappiness that
inside centre, Giustinuainaiai,
thrived. Eyeing down the
pass from a plump Medic
prop, he managed to
intercept the ball and run it
down the middle. There was
unfortunately no report of a
dab following the try. After
this third try the Medics’
heads hung lower than a
zebra’s fifth leg.
The Medics were now easy
pickings with darting runs
from both the forwards and
backs easily tearing them
apart. The fourth and bonus
point try came in the form
of a forward pod offload to
the backline. Winger, and
overwhelmingly French,
Papa Roach received the
aforementioned pass and
managed to bash through the
Medics defense to score. The
final score stood 22-7.
