Abigail de Bruin discusses the Union’s spend on consent training
in light of rising sexual crime statistics
C
onsent is a
pretty hot topic
at the moment.
It’s been in this
newspaper a
lot and in fact
in the national news a lot too.
So why is it that consent is such
a matter of importance in the
public minds at the moment?
Well, to put bluntly, if sex
doesn’t involve it then it’s not
sex – it’s rape. And rape and
related sex crimes (or at least
reported ones) have massively
increased over the last year.
According to the Met Police
crime figures, rape crimes
have increased 10.8% in the
last year to 5939 and Other
Sexual Crime has increased
by 10.7% in the last year to
An anonymous student shares
their story of the damage done by
misconceptions about consent
to me so it must be fine. This is an issue
that hits about as close to home as it can
get. The number of rapes in Kensington
and Chelsea increased 26.3% this year
and the number of other sexual crimes
increased 21.5% this year in Hammersmith
and Fulham. So, in a time where sexual
violence is increasing this much in a single
year, can we really afford to take a stance
against any action that may work towards
decreasing these figures?
I can understand the reluctance to
engage on issues relating to consent.
Without careful consideration of the
discussion it can feel a little similar to one
of those awful sex ed lessons from school
that always ended up more awkward
than informative. That doesn’t mean it’s
not important or worth tackling though.
Society needs to be talking about consent
to start tackling this huge sexual assault
issue and we need to be doing it now.
The £5000 consent training bought
by the Union with College funding has
received such a bashing lately, but I have
to express my support for it.
Sure, maybe it’ll only reach a small
handful of people if not used effectively
but even if it makes just one person think
I
don’t know if this is the place to share
my story, but with so many sexual
assault happenings being opened up
and spoken about, I feel like I should
say something.
They go to Imperial. They were a
friend, someone who provided comfort
and companionship. I never wanted
anything sexual to occur between us, and
I had told them on multiple occasions,
and every time the subject arose I would
refuse.
As with many of these stories, my sexual
assault happened when I was drunk. I was
drunk, and as I often did, I went over to
theirs because it was a safe place, or so
I believed, and I didn’t want to wake my
roommate at the time. I was drunk enough
that I drifted in and out of the realisation
that my trousers were no longer on me,
they were inside me, and then it was over. I
woke up, half naked with them beside me.
Unlike other stories, I didn’t leave straight
away. I asked them what happened, my
heart in my mouth, shaking. They told me
we had sex. Then I left. I was so scared.
My friend, my companion – were they
entitled to these things of me? People I
turned to and asked all told me things that
didn’t help: “You were drunk and went
over, what did you expect?”, “You’ve been
seeing them for a while, it was bound to
happen at some point”, “Just...don’t go
over again”, “They did nothing wrong”, “It
wasn’t rape”, “It’s a grey area.”
No one helped. No one understood.
Even now, six months down the line, my
heart races and my head pounds when
they’re bought up in conversation.
It’s hard to forgive your closest friends
for not understanding. I still don’t think I
have. What’s even harder is how I now see
that others feel they can treat my body as
just that – a body. Now it’s been violated
and used, I can see just how out of control
of it I am. Even to the point where a friend
of mine held me too close for too long and
didn’t stop when I told him to let go. It’s MY
body. It’s MY choice. Not anyone else’s.
Never anyone else’s.
11209 crimes just over the last
12 months. That’s nearly 50
reported sex-related crimes
a day in London alone. If
we consider the statistic, as
reported by Rape Crisis,
that only 15% of those who
experience sexual violence
choose to report to the police,
we’re looking at a figure of
114320 incidents. That’s 13 an
hour.
We can’t just close our eyes
and say it’s not happening

twice about whether or not
they’re pushing a boundary,
if it makes just one person
less aggressive, if it makes my
friends half a percent less likely
to be assaulted on their way
home then I’d say the cost, that
really is only 30p per student,
is absolutely worth it.
