he dreaded day has come and gone. The
world has changed. Donald Trump is a
democratically elected world leader. I don’t
think I’ve processed the tangible reality of
the above sentence quite yet (and what
a sentence: four years, eight years or
life?). The man who inflamed an already polarised
American society, demonised his rivals, maddened his
supporters – the businessman, the tycoon, the clown,
the misogynist, the politician, the actual red terror – is
now a victor.
It’s been particularly intense in the office. What are
the members of a student paper meant to feel when
a man who has threatened to change the laws that
protect press and ensure freedom of speech wins the
popular vote (but not really)? The man whose followers
have insinuated assassination of political rivals and
public lynching of journalists? And all this has been
taking place in ‘The land of the free’.
Dread, disappointment and hopelessness is what I’m
feeling at the moment. Perhaps a dash of anger, but
mostly the numbness that comes with hopelessness.
The result of this election, like numerous others in
recent years, suggests a social split between groups so
disconnected they completely fail to understand each
other. This is the scariest conclusion of all this political
turmoil. We have lost our ability to communicate, to
exchange and discuss ideas that are so different (but
are they different at all?) they seem irreconcilable.
The fact that different ideas scare us so much, in fact,
terrify us to the point of despair, is a problem.
So how do we proceed? We wait and see. And we
listen. We remove ourselves from our echo chambers
and engage with opinions we don’t like, at least until
we understand them.
As for the press, we stay strong. As many have said
in the aftermath of the election, we must face our
responsibilty so that we don’t have to face the music.
Today, the need for truthful, responsible journalism is
greater than ever.
