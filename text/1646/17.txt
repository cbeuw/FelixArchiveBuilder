Cymbeline
C
ymbeline is one
ofShakespeare’s
lesser known
plays. On
reading it before
going for the
production at the Barbican, I
could understand why. There
is a tangle of plot lines: star-
crossed lovers, kidnapped
royal babes, attempted
seduction, attempted
assassination, and topping it
all off, a war between Rome
and Britain. The inevitable
deus ex machina is almost
necessary to bring all of them
to the happy conclusion.
With this background to
work on, it is quite impres-
sive that director, Melly Still,
manages to make Cymbe-
line flow coherently. In the
original, Innogen, the only
remaining heir of King Cym-
beline, marries Posthumus in
secret against the wishes of
her father, who wants her to
marry her stepbrother Cloten.
Posthumus is banished to Italy,
where he is deceived into
believing Innogen has been
unfaithful, and orders her
murdered. As Innogen flees
Britain, a remorseful Posthu-
mus seeks death in the battle
against Rome.
Melly Still takes several
liberties with the setting, char-
acters and even the lines of
the play. She is supported in
this by the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which certainly
lives up to its reputation. I
didn’t know Shakespeare
had such a sense of humour
until I heard the lines brought
to life on stage! Bethan Cull-
inane was especially good
as Innogen – her delivery
was so natural, it was easy
to forget that the lines of
dialogue were written in the
17th
century.
Much has been made of
Cymbeline’s relevance to
Brexit and Britain’s slide
towards insularity, but for me
it wasn’t the major theme of
the evening. There certainly
was an undercurrent of
‘Britain against the world’ –
memorably Cloten’s brash
claim; “Britain is / A world
by itself; and we will nothing
pay / For wearing our own
noses.” Meanwhile, Italy
is portrayed as a luxurious
casino compared to the
barren, resource-poor Britain.
Just under the surface there
is the not-so-subtle question
about Britain’s fate; should it
decide to cut itself off from
the rest of the world?
For me, the more interesting
facet of the production was
its exploration of gender
roles; gender-bending is a
major feature of Melly Still’s
production. This is intriguing
in Cymbeline, a play that

women; “Be it lying, note it, /
The woman’s; flattering, hers;
deceiving, hers; / Lust and
rank thoughts, hers, hers…”
In this production, King
Cymbeline and his conniving
second wife become Queen
Cymbeline and a power-hun-
gry duke. Because of our
current social norms, a female
Cymbeline is perhaps better
at portraying the character’s
inherent vulnerability as well
as Cymbeline’s deep love for
her children. Gillian Bevan
does an excellent job at
balancing this with Cymbe-
line’s strong side as ruler of
a chaotic and divided coun-
try. It also made for some
amusing lines; in Act III when
Cymbeline speaks of Caesar,
she declares with a wink: “My
youth I spent / Much under
him”.
Ultimately though, Cymbe-
line is a love story, and Melly
Still’s production is very much
about Innogen and Posthumus
rather than the titular char-
acter. Bethan Cullinane and
Hiran Abeysekera pull off a
moving performance of two
young people in the first flush
of love. When Abeysekera
as Posthumus orders Innogen
killed in a fit of jealousy, it is
the understandable decision
of a young man driven mad
by passion; the crushing
regret and torment he later
experiences is palpable.
One does feel at times that
the play is trying to do too
many things at once, some
of which don’t quite work.
The Soothsayer, a minor
character in the original play,
wanders rather gratuitously
(and confusingly) in and out
of the scenes. Act V provoked
a giggling fit in the audience
member sitting next to me
when little paper men floated
down from the ceiling to rep-
resent the spirits of Posthumus’
dead family.
This is a playful treatment
of Shakespeare’s Cymbeline;
an enjoyable production
that despite its light-heart-
edness manages to discuss
serious themes of gender and
nationalism.

makes much of the impor-

Shakespeare implies that
some qualities are intrinsic –
the noble instincts of the long
lost Arviragus and Guideria
shine through despite their
decidedly un-royal upbring-
ing. “How hard it is to hide
the sparks of nature!”
What does it mean to be
female? Shakespeare is
intrigued by this question in
the original play. Innogen,
though an object of desire
for Posthumus, Cloten and
Iachimo, must “forget to
be a woman” when she
cross-dresses as a page boy.
In Posthumus’ rant against
Innogen, he attributes “all
faults that man may name” to
