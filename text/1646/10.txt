to planet hop and live
elsewhere? Efforts are
currently underway for a
manned mission to Mars,
and research is ongoing
with regards to how we
would populate the red
planet. If we can move out
of our planet and mine
resources from other plan-
ets, then the universe is
our oyster. Then not only
is overpopulation solved,
but we could potentially
expand beyond any limits.
But this is a race against
time. Elon Musk with his
SpaceX program and
desire to die on Mars just
“not on landing” may take
us one more step closer
to colonising it. He hopes
to have astronauts on
Mars by 2025. NASA has
more humble predictions
of sending astronauts into
orbit by 2030. Having an
actual civilisation on Mars
therefore seems to be dec-
ades off.
There are those who
would preach for us to
stop having children or
to just have one child. In
their self-induced panic,
they may even set an
example for the world.
Fair play to them. But
beyond the sudden pang
of morality you might feel
from hearing them preach
and beyond the panic that
ensues from watching a
film such as Inferno as
you tentatively put on
your intellectual’s glasses
and begin to consider if a
population cull is what is
really needed, we should
actually sit down and con-
sult the figures.
The idea that population
growth is exponential is
one that is thrown around
quite a lot. And quite
callously might I add.
From the comparisons of
humanity as a virus and
the images in your mind
of cells dividing uncon-
trollably, exponential
population growth – the
increasing growth rate of
something proportional
to its total quantity – is
not supported by the
statistics. Starting at 1800
in the space of a hundred
years we doubled, then
in the next hundred years
we multiplied by around
six and in the following
15 have increased from
around six billion to seven
billion.
Hold on you say. Things
look like they’re increas-
ing crazily. However,
contrary to the panic
the internet will leave
you in, Hans Rosling, a
Swedish medical doctor
and statistician, believes
overpopulation is a myth
and will not surpass
eleven billion. He claims
that since the 60’s, popu-
lation has been growing
steadily, not exponen-
tially. He explains that
the population will grow
some more, but as access
to medical care, contra-
ceptives, empowerment of
women, better education
for women and men, later
births, family planning
and rising living stand-
ards all kick in, the birth
rate will sustain itself.
The death rate and the
birth rate will be roughly
equal. As living standards
rise, people will have
less children and focus
on giving them a better
standard of living. The
population is predicted to
reach 9.5 bn by 2050 and
10.9 bn by 2100. So the
value of 32bn within this
century quoted in Inferno
seems to be nonsense.
The idea that population
will stabilise therefore
makes sense. Add to that
the projected betterment
of technology, the fact
that – as Ester Boserup,
eminent Danish econo-
mist put it – the threat of
starvation and increased
demand motivates people
to modify and research
into agriculture, pro-
duce new technology
and modify methods to
increase food production
and better understanding
of the world in general,
the future may not look
so bleak. Overpopulation
may not even be some-
thing to fear. What we
should probably fear is
us messing things up by
destroying ourselves in a
war that we can’t come
back from. And destroy-
ing the animal and plant
kingdom because of our
activities and global
warming.
Overpopulation may not
be the problem the film
suggests it is, but if one
thing is for sure, while we
may be producing enough
food for everyone, we
certainly don’t know how
to distribute it. Instead of
films like Inferno scare-
mongering about the
threat of more humans,
maybe we should focus
on how to get the food we
have to those who need
it and educate people to
feast responsibly and sus-
tainably for the betterment
of all. It’s a crazy world,
but we have the tools to
manage it.
