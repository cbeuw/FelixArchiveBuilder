he Night Tsar’
is not a period
thriller starring Tom
Hiddleston, but
rather something
far more ambitious.
The night tsar is going to
save London’s nightlife
single-handedly and raise
an industry from its knees,
away from the clutches of the
London property machine. It’s
a big task, but thankfully the
woman appointed to the job
seems to have a glowing CV:
Amy Láme is a 45-year-old
comedian.
To be fair to her, she
did found a club night in
Vauxhall back in 1995,
and recently campaigned
successfully against the Royal
Vauxhall Tavern’s closure,
but she’s hardly a stalwart
of the industry. The whole
appointment screams of a
publicity stunt to me, and
the effectiveness of a tsar to
manage and communicate
with such a wide range of
stakeholders is ambitious at
best. London’s nightclubs are
declining rapidly, by 40% in
the last 5 years alone. Recent
closures include Plastic People
in 2015, Dance Tunnel in
June of this year and, most
infamously of all, Fabric this
September. So why is the
industry declining so rapidly?
Gentrification of London’s
poorer areas, the traditional
Tinder, and a healthy 8 hours
of sleep followed by a kale
smoothie is the on-trend way
to live. How a tsar can entice
the risk-averse, telly-and-du-
vet generation to spend £7
on a watery vodka cranberry
every weekend is going
to be the real challenge,
even if the London property
behemoth can be successfully
restrained.

haunting ground for London’s
best clubs, is largely to
blame, with new property
developers building flats right
next to venues. The residents
move into the property, and
immediately complain about
the noise, meaning the council
forces the club to install noise
insulation it can’t afford.
Inevitably the club goes out
of business. Sadiq Khan says
he intends to introduce a
law to force developers to
pay for this instead of the
clubs, but I think the presence
of older, wealthier families
will always produce friction
when rubbing shoulders with
nightlife; it’s only a matter
of time before issues other
than noise arise, and councils
inevitably side with the middle
class nuclear family. Another
reason clubs are failing is
that millennials simply don’t
like them that much. Netflix
is cheaper, sex is found on

So Long
Forever –
Palace
S
o Long Forever is
Palace’s eagerly
anticipated
debut album. The
group have been
releasing singles
and EPs from 2012, turning
heads and building up a
loyal fan base. Wah-wah
guitars compliment frontman
Wyndam’s distinctive woozy
voice, delivering emotionally
charged, repetitive lyrics.
Track one, Breaking the
Silence sets the scene of the
subdued frustration to follow.
Only one out of eleven of the
seamlessly into the album.
It’s Over is a clear highlight,
with rhythmic guitars and
percussion building to
a cathartic, somewhat
optimistic crescendo; riffs and
high-pitched lyrics give an
impression of the collective’s
range, while maintaining
the theme that has been
so artfully created. Some
tracks, like Family, are more
bluesy, with reverb and echo
creating an almost folky feel.
The chilled sound is perhaps
a reflection of Palace’s work
space. The Arch is a casual
studio with local bands
and Horus Records coming
together to keep rent low and
workspace available at all
times. “The future is bright if
we can ebb with the flow”
Wyndham sings on Live Well,
a philosophy that seems to be
serving the group just fine.

Corsica Studios
Ranked an impressive 2nd
on Resident Advisor’s list of top London
clubs, it boasts impressive soundsystems and a friendly vibe,
conveniently situated only a couple of minutes walk from Elephant
and Castle station. Run as a not-for-profit, it is an enterprise in
sustaining arts and culture in London. With its wide range of acts
including live music in one studio and top-billing DJs in the other,
you’ll find you just keep coming back for more.

After fabric’s tragic closure at the end of October, many of us are left frantically searching for a
substitute to tide us over until the appeal on 28th
November. Fear not, felix has you covered! Take
a look at these great venues...
This behemoth of everything dance music has been a flagship
of London nightlife since way back in 1991. Also very close to
Elephant and Castle station, it has been the cause of drunken
night bus journeys home for generations of Imperial freshers.
Make sure to return for one of its many incredible listings!
Ministry of Sound
Phonox CLF Art Cafe
Taking us further South of the river - it’s worth it, trust me - Phonox
occupies the space previously held by Brixton favourite Plan B. This
relatively new addition to the scene pulls in the crowds. Recently
launching their Sunday night sessions with the likes of Gilles Peterson
and Daniel Avery, they keep the format refreshing. Fridays see a
regular lineup of heavyweights, this venue more than makes up for the
journey.
Our last entry in South London, this multi-purpose arts
venue is located in the imposing industrial architecture of
the former warehouse Bussey Building, Peckham. It never
fails to deliver. Three stories, each with its own dance floor
and unique selectors. The vibes vary greatly on each floor
and each day of the weekend, blasting disco, soul, house
and techno.
XOYO
Student favourite XOYO has earned its reputation through
consistently putting on fantastic nights. Situated in Shoreditch, this
reknowned nightclub provides for more than just hipsters. Its large
floors normally play contrasting music on club nights, giving some-
thing for everyone to enjoy.

Oval Space \\
Stark photographic studio by day, when the sun goes down this
space becomes a go to destination for a series of frequently sold
out events. A bespoke Function soundsystem fully satisfies in this
large warehouse space. A few minutes from Shadwell station, this
furthers our exploration of East London’s nightlife.
Studio Spaces
Oval Space
The Nest
Stunningly beautiful, a wall of windows gives venue-goers a view
of the decomissioned gasworks of Bethnal Green. You’ll never
forget your nights out here, with listings ranging from live music
to giants of electronic dance music. Everyone should visit at least
once.
Opened in 2010, this Dalston club is now a stalwart of the
London nightlife scene. A capacity of 350 still draws in big-hitters
from across the underground electronic scene. A favourite with
locals, the focus is always firmly on the music. The long, narrow
format of the club means you can really find a spot to dance and
lose yourself in the moment.
