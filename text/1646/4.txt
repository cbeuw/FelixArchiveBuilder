Union report highlights
C&S underfunding
L
ast Tuesday at council,
Clubs and Societies
Deputy President,
James Cox, presented
his report in which he
addressed the issue of
Clubs, Societies and Projects
(CSP) underfunding. An
investigation looking at figures
from 2009 onwards showed
a marked increase in student
led activity and its associated
cost. This increase in cost was
not paired with a proportional
increase in direct financial
support.
These results come at an
interesting point in time for
Imperial, historically struggling
to maintain high levels of
student satisfaction which hit an
all time low this year. In fact,
the National Student Survey
(NSS) report for 2016 revealed
a drop in student satisfaction
across all categories, which
include Teaching, Assessment
and Feedback, and Academic
Support. Satisfaction with the
Union in particular, saw a seven
point decrease from 2015,
placing ICU on 56th
place in the
Higher Education rankings.
In his report, Cox said that
the “CSP Grant had been
maintained in approximate
value from 2012, not
accounting for inflation,” which
is problematic considering the
constant expansion of CSP. “As
costs have increased without
increased financial support
from the union, significant
costs are being pushed onto
membership income and other
profit making activities,” he
continued.
At the same time the Union
has been encouraging the
expansion of student-led
activities with the creation of an
Activities Development Fund.
However the funding is only
partial and after one year,
clubs are expected to include
any new activities into their
annual budgeting, funding for
which rarely increases.
If many clubs and societies
are to maintain the breadth of
activities they offer at student
friendly rates, they need
more money. The Union aims
to renegotiate block grant
with College this year and
considering the great lengths
Imperial is going to, in an effort
to increase student satisfaction,
it might just succeed. However
Cox warns “there is not an
unlimited supply of income to
the union to distribute towards
CSP funding,” and although
students seem to prioritise
CSP over other services, more
consultation is needed before
any decisions are made.
Imperial team wins iGEM competition
Matt Johnston
This they did through an Apple
and Android game, Go Culture,
which aimed to dispel negative
perceptions of microbes and
bacteria.
Their successes with all the
parts led them to winning the
Gold Medal plus five major
prizes. These included ‘Best
Foundational Advance Project’
(their competition category),
‘Best Poster’, ‘Best Wiki’,
‘Best New Basic Part’, and
‘Best Education and Public
Engagement’.
The winning team consisted
of members of two Imperial
departments; Lisa Asher,
Alice Boo, Akashaditya

mperial triumphed at the
International Genetically
Engineered Machine
(iGEM) competition in
Boston last week, with
their project ‘Ecolibrium’
beating almost 300 other
undergraduate teams from
around the globe.
The project centres around a
process known as ‘Co-culturing’
where different types of cells
are grown together. The benefit
of doing this is that it opens
up different pathways for
synthesis of complex biological
entities that weren’t previously
possible before. The downside
is that different cells require
varying conditions to thrive and
preferring one set of conditions
means one type of cell thrives
and the rest, well, don’t.
The solution the team’s design
iscentredaroundiscompromise,
finding a balance of conditions
that allow different cells to
grow at optimal conditions in
the same culture. They also
designed some genetic circuitry
to force two cells to coexist at
pre-determined ratios. The
idea wasn’t the only part of
the competition, the teams also
had to engage the public to
their project and explain what
was going on to people who
weren’t specialists in the field.
