energy state. Then people will
– having learnt their lessons
– realise where they went
wrong and rebuild society on
a more sustainable, simpler
model. The war will solve the
population problem as well,
by wiping out a goo chunk of
it. If the remnants of nuclear
war don’t create an uninhab-
itable environment, maybe
the few lucky survivors will
be able to rebuild society. But
the tragedy beyond all of this,
is that even if some survive,
the history shows humans do
not seem to learn the lessons
of the past, especially not
those of war. Two world wars
in the space of twenty years,
and much more in between
and after. It seems war may
just be part of our nature.
Overpopulation may just be a
frustration that lets us express
that nature once again.
But maybe science and
technology will lead us to
the solution. And what will
that solution be? Maybe
we worry about earth as
the only planet we have,
but maybe that won’t be
the case in the future.
What if we colonise other
planets and our popula-
tion can spill over and we
develop the technology
O

Inferno this

the question
of how we
would survive overpopulation
struck a chord with me. It
may have been a slightly dull
film at times but the theme
nevertheless was a relevant
and intriguing one. Essentially,
a billionaire concerned with
overpopulation creates a virus
to cull the number of humans
in the world. Robert Langdon
then proceeds to chase clues
through art, ends up finding
where the virus is due to be
released and *spoiler alert*
ultimately saves the day.
Despite being a work of
fiction, the questions asked
throughout the film seem to
be very real. At some point
the rising population will over-
take the resources we have.
How then will we sustain
ourselves?
Many have thought of
solutions, but most seem to
be about culling the popu-
lation, not sustaining it. An
increasing death rate due to
war sparked by competition
for resources, or a decrease
in birth rate implemented by
governments, like China’s
one-child-policy seem to be
the main options. But will
our governments take action
proportionate to the crisis we
are possibly facing, or will
we mess things up and reach
a shit-hit-the-fan scenario like
humans seem prone to doing?
The population was 0.8bn in
1800; by 1900 it had become
1.6bn and by 2000 it was
6.115 bn. We now stand at
more than seven bn. The
numbers at first glance seem
to point to certain disaster for
the future.
Given the toxic mix of
increased population, further
damage from climate change
and increased technologically
advanced and destructively
powerful weaponry, how
to manage and handle the
problems of the future are
something that needs to be
taken seriously. So what are
the potential solutions?
The first and most obvious
one is the advancement of sci-
ence and technology. Science
has been our ‘saviour’ which
has generated and sustained
the industrial revolution and
allowed the population to
explode so dramatically.
Most of the work being done
– except those few eccentric
genocidal billionaires appar-
ently – is in this area. From
mitigating climate change
and creating clean and
sustainable energy resources,
to improving healthcare and
growing more food, all ave-
nues are being explored. This
seems to be the most obvious
way forward without a mor-
ally dubious solution to the
problem. In our all-pervading
mentality of the consumer
comes first, and rising living
standards of the world, most
of us are not willing to or
have even considered radical
lifestyle changes.
Yet these changes could
be a real solution to the
problem of overpopulation.
There would have to be
radical changes to what is
currently accepted as a norm
of lifestyle; a solution where
the consumption of resources
would decrease radically. If
we are to strip life bare and
think about it, what is it that
we really need to survive and
be happy? Food, health-
care, a roof over our heads,
companionship, some sort of
work and some sort of enter-
tainment. Instead of being a
consumer orientated society
we would have to become
oriented around not having
and acquiring new things, but
being satisfied with what is
there and finding pleasure in
the repetition. That is a mas-
sive and somewhat untenable
cultural shift that would have
to occur, but it is not impossi-
ble. Yet statistics and human
nature seem to be against us.
Demands shift as living condi-
tions get better. For example
better lifestyles correlate with
bigger demands for meat
and dairy, so grain that could
be used to feed many more
people goes into feeding ani-
mals to make more of what
we want. But we need our
cheeseburgers apparently.
Yet cultural shift is not
impossible. These changes
have been seen to come into
play via two ways –wars and
revolutions. Both are tragic,
bloody and traumatic. The
latter is a possibility but I
think it unlikely that people
would rise up in some sort
of green revolution against
governments, solely due to
the threat of overpopulation
or indeed climate change.
What seems more likely is
that society becomes reset
through the almost unavoid-
able consequence of war
occurring due to a fight for
resources and supremacy in
a world which knows things
are going wrong but refuses
to face the facts. It as if the
world will head to a high
energy state; the bubble of
our ego’s will inflate and
continue to do so till it bursts,
expends its energy in war,
and finally returns to a low

F
act: You can un-boil
an egg.
Boiling an egg
causes a fundamen-
tal change in the
proteins that make
up the egg white, which you’ll
know if you ever had eggs
and soldiers as a kid because
a raw egg and a cooked egg
look pretty different. The high
temperature causes the pro-
teins to lose their shape and
tangle up, turning the white
from a liquid into a gloopy,
rubbery solid.
What you may not know is
that scientists can reverse this
process, in effect ‘un-boiling’
the egg. A chemical called
urea can be used to untangle
proteins in the egg white,
which allows them to then
re-fold in the correct way.
Spin it all around a few times
(really, really fast) and within
a couple of minutes, just like
that, the protein has re-folded
correctly and your egg is raw
again.
Applications of this research
could save hours of labour
in certain industries, and
addresses that age old
problem “I don’t really feel
like a boiled egg anymore, I
wish I could have scrambled
instead.” Although you may
not want to try this at home;
urea is a major component of
urine, and that’s enough to
put anyone off breakfast.

Spotlight on Medicine
Scientists here at Imperial
College have created an
extremely easy way of
testing for HIV. A simple
USB device detects the virus
and sends corresponding
electrical impulses that
can be read on a laptop
or handheld device. Not
only does this allow testing
to be quicker, easier and
self-applicable throughout
treatment, but it can also
enable patients in remote
locations immediate on-site
results. The device itself is
disposable, and works by
monitoring levels of the virus
in the blood. Before this
technology, results would
take as long as three days
following testing, with sam-
ples often having to be sent
back to laboratories. Cur-
rent HIV treatment is known
as anti-retroviral treatment,
and works by reducing HIV
levels to near zero. The
USB sensor could be used
to directly monitor whether
a patient is responding
to treatment, or if it has
stopped working. For
some, especially those in
less developed countries,
this rapid way of testing
could mean the difference
between life and death.

3. Key Protein for Spinal Cord Repair Found
Zebrafish are amazing
when it comes to regen-
eration. Even when their
spinal cord is completely
severed, it can completely
restore itself. In humans,
a severed spinal cord can
leave them completely
paralysed or dead.
Research into spinal cord
studies and stem cells have
given many hope that
one day broken spines
can be fixed, and now
we seem to be one step
closer. By studying these
tiny transparent animals,
scientists have been able
to pinpoint the exact
protein that is responsible
for re-joining the spinal
cord and enabling it to
work again. The protein
in question is called
CTGF, which stands for
connective tissue growth
factor. Humans also have
CTGF, and although it
differs slightly to the form
found in zebrafish, when
the human protein was
added it worked in the
same way. Although the
protein is not the whole
story, it gives scientists a
clue to how regenera-
tion works. The question
now is what does the
zebrafish have, that we
humans don’t?
According to those
working on the project,
the next step is looking
at regeneration proteins
in mice.

New tests have found
that a human antibody
(given the catchy name of
ZIKV-117) can actually save
infected mice from dying of
Zika, whilst also shielding
their unborn babies from its
adverse effects. As I’m sure
you’re aware, in humans
the virus has been linked
to birth defects in babies
with infected mothers. This
usually results in a smaller
than usual head and,
consequently, brain which
may affect the child’s
learning, motor function
and cognitive develop-
ment. The condition is
known as microcephaly.
Despite this recent break-
through, researchers are
unsure whether this
would work on humans,
however they remain
optimistic. Trials need
to be completed on
other primates before
reaching humans, but
if it works, could act as
protection against a
now terrifyingly wide-
spread disease.
