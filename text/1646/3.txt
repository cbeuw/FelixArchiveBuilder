The US presidential election fallout
This is the end, beautiful friend

T
hey only went and
bloody voted for
him, didn’t they? By
now if you haven’t
seen the news that
Donald Trump,
the Washington outsider,
is the 45th
President of The
United States then I’m not
sure if you’ve actually been
conscious since Wednesday.
For those of you that read the
headline and started weeping
before you could get past the
opening paragraph, fear not
as here’s a deeper look into
what occurred.

What went down?
Between about midnight
and 7am on Wednesday
morning, as the polls closed
across America and counting
commenced as the results
began to eventually trickle
in. The way the US election
works is that people can’t
really be arsed waiting
around until all votes have
been counted. Instead a
panel of experts and statis-
ticians for each TV network
sit down and analyse the
cumulative vote tally as all the
little voting areas send in their
totals. This means that once a
very strong trend is seen and
the experts are sure a state
is going one way or another
they ‘call’ it and it’s added to
the electoral college votes.
This means some results came
in pretty quickly after voting
stopped.
No big surprises early on,
the Democrat states voted for
Hillary Clinton and the Repub-
lican ones went for Trump.
The key to the election lied in
the swing states with the large
number of electoral votes
(Pennsylvania, Ohio and king
of them all, Florida). Trump
won those as well as the
Republican heartlands and so
won the election. Simple.
Why were the polls wrong?
Probably shy Trump voters
hiding their true intentions,
although currently the big
forecasters are in post
mortem mode. The underlying
voting demographics are
likely to be scrutinised for
where the surges (or
suppressions) that helped
Trump were. The results
were 228 for Clinton and
279 for Trump (9 over the
magical 270 electoral votes
needed). But Clinton leads
the popular vote, 59,942,917
to 59,704,842. More people
voted for her but she lost.
Welcome to democracy.
Aside from the main
prizefight there were the
elections for parts of Con-
gress. Another great night for
the Republicans who came
away with both the House of
Representatives and Senate
(the two parts of Congress)
meaning that they now hold
the balance of power in both
legislative bodies that motions
have to pass. This means that
it’s easier for Trump to enact
things he wants to, as long as
these align with the views of
the wider Republican party.
If Trump strays too far right
(or even left) they’ll hopefully
keep him on the straight and
narrow. Parts of Congress are
up for grabs next year again
and so control of one or both
the branches could fall back
into Democrat hands, keeping
an even tighter leash on The
Donald. Oh and by virtue of
them being on a joint ticket,
Mike Pence is now the Vice
President. Will he accomplish
anything? Will he become
president when Trump gets
bored and leaves? Who
knows.
After Trump managed half
the 538 Electoral College
votes, twitter, financial mar-
kets, and quite a lot of the
wider world started to freak
out. The FTSE (UK), Dax
(Germany), Dow Jones and
Nasdaq (both US) all plum-
meted upon hearing the news
before actually regaining
to roughly where they were
before. Massive currency
fluctuations were seen at first
and then died down but this
What’shappenedsince?
is only early days. Gold was
up in price in the immediate
aftermath, great news for all
you pirates out there.
International governments
queued up to give the cus-
tomary congratulations to
Trump with varying degrees
of sincerity. Putin was first and
hopes to strengthen US-Rus-
sian relations with Trump (the
two of them have praised
each other in the past). The-
resa May also passed on her
congratulations; she doesn’t
want to lose both the US and
the EU as a trading partner in
one year, after all. Anti-Trump
riots were also a thing, with
effigies of the president elect
being burnt in several cities
across the US as well as a
protest at the US embassy in
London too (see page 5).
What’snext?
Erm, nobody really knows.
Trump will be sworn in offi-
cially on January 20th
and
from then his reign begins.
How chaotic and apocalyptic
it will be remains to be seen.
He might start a few wars, he
might kickstart the economy
or he might do both. Only
time will tell.
