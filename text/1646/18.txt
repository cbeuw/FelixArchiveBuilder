a solid foundation is built
for any future seasons.
Personally, I’m left to wonder
how such seemingly ‘selfless’
people are comfortable
with some esoteric criteria
condemning all others to
eternal damnation. Clearly,
there’s a catch. The acting
is, unsurprisingly, great
although Danson and Bell
do tend to dominate on that
front. Danson really gets
to show off his versatility
here, successfully capturing
Michael’s unsure yet
optimistic nature. All things
considered, this is definitely
an interesting idea, and I’d
be glad to see network TV go
this way.

But the Terror is believed

obsessive, and mentally

is the only one who knows
otherwise. Fortunately, there’s
the titular Tick. Written by
Tick creator Ben Edlund, and
produced by iconic Tick actor
Patrick Warburton, this latest
distillation embraces a tonal
shift, being more serious,
and ‘dark and gritty’. Now,

of Amazon’s latest round
of original programming,
The Tick returns to our
screens, now played by
Peter Serafinowicz, in a
decidedly more complex
adaptation compared to
previous incarnations. The

to a comic book adaptation
(because God forbid superhe-
roes not be assholes, right?),
but here it feels earned. The
Tick has always to-an-extent
been a satire of superheroes,
and consequently frequently
been darkly comic. What’s
more is that this ‘darkening’ is
subverted slightly. 		
The character of the Tick
himself remains untouched.
He’s still cartoonish, probably
insane, and prone to long
speeches riddled with mixed
metaphors, in short, a classic
superhero. The show cleverly
inverts the usual comedic
formula of a straight man
in an absurd world, with an
incredibly absurd man in a
depressingly realistic world.
The pilot does a fantastic job
of establishing this new City’s
status quo, and introducing
us succinctly to the main cast.
In particular, the decision
to make the point-of-view
character Arthur, instead of
the Tick, is to be commended.
In addition to grounding
the viewers’ perspectives, it
also adds another layer of
obsessive tendencies with his gen-
uine desire to do good. The ever
underrated Jackie Earle Haley puts
in a typically solid and understated
performance as the Terror. Ser-
afinowicz seems to have a great
time cheesing it up as the blue bug,
and while he doesn’t quite match
Warburton’s highs, he does an
amicable job. I’m confident he’ll
grow into the role, given the time.
The series is a solid blend of satire,
dark comedy, drama, and classic
superhero cheese.

Conversely though, a lot
of attention is paid to small

humour to be drawn from
seemingly small elements of

underrated late 90s
sitcom gem, was
something of a staple
of my formative years.
So, naturally, when a
new sitcom with his involvement
was announced, I took notice. The
Good Place follows one Eleanor
Shellstrop, played by Kristen
Bell, who dies in a freak erectile
dysfunction-related accident and
finds herself in the titular ‘Good
Place’. There’s just one problem,
Eleanor is nowhere near as ‘good’
a person as the location’s creator
Michael, played by Danson,
believes her to be. 		
The series generally follows her
as she attempts to fit in with her
surroundings and avoid getting
caught and sent to ‘The Bad
Place’, helpfully described by
horrific screaming. The premise,
though it may sound outlandish,
is a refreshing change from
the banality of contemporary
network sitcoms. Instead, it evokes
memories of cult classics such as
Pushing Daisies, with similarly
bubble-gummy visuals. Similarly,
the comedy is not abrasive,
ostentatious, or too in-your-
face. Jokes are subtle and
consistent, keeping you
entertained throughout.
