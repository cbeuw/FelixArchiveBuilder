Make restaurants great again
felix discusses what really makes a
restaurant shine, with a trip to Popolo
– one of Shoreditch’s many new
trendy eateries that for once isn’t just
overblown hype.
in a vibrant, sweet romesco
sauce, with some crunch from
the almonds and hazelnuts.
The Carabineros ended
the mains with a blast of
excitement: the palm-sized
red prawn was grilled whole.
We fought to break the body
from the head, separating
the luscious meat from the
shell, sucking the hot juices
from the head. The simple
flavours of the sea blended
in seamlessly with the smoky
flavours from the grill, infused
into every inch of the shrimp
and diffused through our
mouths. Our faces were in
the same happiness as the
photo of Munur’s eleven year-
old daughter savouring her
father’s creation.
To allow our stomachs to
be full at this stage was a
very wrong move indeed.
We were presented with two
desserts. The first was a moist
orange and almond cake,
with coarse bits of almonds
which was a surprise from
the usual finely grounded
almonds. The second was a
wobbly delight – a panna
cotta. This was not any panna
cotta, but a burnt honey
H
ow do you
differentiate
between a good
and an excellent
restaurant? Is
it the Michelin-
starred chef behind the
counter splattering sauce over
thumb-sized morsels of food?
Is it the extra 0.1 rating or
half a star on OpenTable? Or
is it the two-hour-long queue
outside the no-reservation
system every evening?
Different people have
varying standards of a good
dining experience. Some
people may tend towards
the quality of the food itself,
while others deliver their
reviews based on service and
value. For me, the deciding
factor is not just the food, or
how accessible the booking
system was or if I’m getting
what I paid for. What matters
is something deeper: the
personal interactions I can
create with the atmosphere,
the stories and the people
that accompany each dish.
Perhaps this is why I tend
towards exploring street
food markets and small
independent eateries over
well-established chains.
Instead of tasting the food
exactly as how it was placed
before me on the plate, I get
to see action. I get to speak to
the person making my food,
not delivering my orders to a
waiter. I get to savour each
owner’s stories from their
past, and their aspirations.
It’s those tiny details that add
a greater depth of flavour on
my tongue, give understand-
ing of the food, and establish
a long-lasting impression in
my memory.
A restaurant that has
given me exactly what I was
looking for was Popolo, an
Italian-inspired eatery that
had opened just a few weeks
ago on Rivington Street, in
the heart of Shoreditch. The
two-story restaurant was
dressed in a dark grey, almost
blending in with the quiet
neighbourhood. Some paint-
work in a contrasting yellow
colour paralleled with the
graffiti some 50 metres away.
Upon entering we were
greeted by an open kitchen
surrounded by an L-shaped
bar, giving full view of all
the kitchen theatre. Upstairs
was a small dining area with
tables and a bar table stretch-
ing along the window. The
simple, grey, industrial-style
interior carried through from
the door up along the brick
walls, and was a complete
juxtaposition of the vibrant
experience that followed.
Munur, the manager and
co-owner, greeted us with
such welcoming warmth that
we instantly felt at home on
our seats by the window. He
entertained us with wonderful
stories of his past as an invest-
ment banker, how he started
the restaurant with Jon, the
co-owner and head chef, and
their ideas. He showed us
photos of the transformation
of the restaurant from an
Indian takeaway to what it is
now, talked about the seven
weeks of renovation with such
excitement while pointing at a
white streak on the brick wall
where the original white walls
had been.
Munur left us to taste the
first two plates: fried olives
with its roe still attached, on
a bed of lentils and green
laver seaweed. The scallop
itself was perfectly cooked,
still soft and succulent inside.
The risotto nero came as an
impressive plate of glossy,
creamy, flavourful jet black
rice, with generous chunks of
tender squid and two cheeky
tentacles on top. The Pulpo,
one of their signatures, was a
plate of octopus and potato
slices all in an enticing sun-
set-red. The octopus was the
complete opposite from the
tough, rubbery, overcooked
pieces of protein you get
elsewhere, and was soft and
supple.
Our meal creeped up to a
climax with two more dishes.
Our vegetable dish featured
Romanesco and cauliflower

and chickpeas on labne,
and a plate of bright green
Padron peppers. The olives
were crunchy golden nuggets
exploding with their mellow,
earthy juices, scooping up the
smooth, mild-flavoured labne
and drips of chilli oil. The
Padron peppers came warm,
dressed in olive oil and sea
salt, and were soft, juicy and
sweet.
A selection of dishes from
the seafood menu appeared
on our table swiftly after.
The Capesante was a huge,
orange, grilled diver scallop
vanilla version with sweet figs
poached in red wine. The
caramel notes came through
from the velvety smooth
cream, introducing a strong
floral aftertaste.
Popolo was what I was
searching for in a restaurant
– simple, delicious food, in a
unique atmosphere, people
who are passionate about
what they do, and a wonder-
ful story behind it.
In the age of Deliveroo and
convenience foods, why should you
cook at all? felix finds how the easiest
way to connect with people isn’t in
Metric or Nandos – it’s over your
stovetop (wine helps too).

Why cook at all?
T
he easiest way
to make friends,
anywhere, anytime,
but specifically in
college? Cook!
I don’t mean the
morning milk-and-cereal or
ready meals you buy and just
put in the microwave for five
to ten minutes, I mean real
food, prepared ‘with love’,
just as your mother used to
do before you left. I am not
a chef, but from time to time
I like to cook and more often
than not, the food doesn’t end
up in the trash. And every
time I prepare something, my
kitchen gets full – not only of
tasty smells and veggies and
pots – but of people.
Someone just enters the
recipe or other, but most of
the time I just improvise with
things I have in the fridge.
Once I tried to cook a
recipe from an anime –
Shokugeki no Soma, if you
want to know – and it was
quite successful. So successful
that even though I planned
making enough food for at
least two days, it was gone in
less than half an hour with the
help of six (or maybe nine?)
people. And this is what
kitchen to get some water or
something and they go with
the classic “Oh! This smells
good! What are you cook-
ing?” and I’ll just ask them
to stay and have a bite as I
hardly ever really know what
I am actually cooking – from
time to time I follow some happens most of the times I
try cooking something that
requires more than just the
use of a microwave.
But I don’t mind. I really
don’t. Actually, I like it when
people come to eat with me –
it somehow makes me feel like
home; people everywhere,
who talk about their day and
are happy over some pie and
a glass of wine. The kitchen,
quite a magical place, actu-
ally makes college feel more
like a home than expected, as
long as people have a reason
to spend time in there.
And this is so perfect for a
shy person (like me). There is
nothing more I hate than start-
ing a conversation, but in the
kitchen there is no need for
a start – people just talk and
change subject and laugh
and spend time together;
there is no awkward silence –
you always have the perfect
sounds of food simmering and
wine pouring. Cooking really
helped me make friends, and
not just friends among the
people who live in the same
flat as me.
But don’t take my word for
it! Just go cook and share
some of your food with
people – even if you are not
that skilled in the kitchen,
most people would appreci-
ate the effort and the fact that
you thought about them too.
(Of course, they would
appreciate it even more if you
could serve them a perfectly
cooked steak and some choc-
olate cake, but hey, you’re
only a student and you’ve just
began your journey in the
kitchen).
I mean, there aren’t college rules on plaigarism for cooking...
Quick and easy
No, I’m not describing one of your
sexcapades – that would lose me
my job. Here’s a simple weeknight
recipe for something you can really
call home cooking.
I
must confess – the last
time I made a stew, it took
me 72 hours from start to
finish. Short ribs, cooked
at 54o
C for two-and-a-
half days in my waterbath
were mouthwateringly tender
Sanjay Bhattacharya
and exceptionally beefy, with
a wonderful red wine sauce
and plenty of just tender veg.
But fear not! You don’t need
to raid the lab for a waterbath
for this stew.
I’ve tried to keep it quite
simple here, but feel free to
mix it up as much as you want.
Beef can be swapped for lamb
or pork, but try and pick stew-
ing cuts – they’re cheaper,
anyhow.
Start by heating the oil – a
good splash – in a large pan.
When almost smoking, add in
half the beef and get stirring
– you don’t want to burn any-
thing, but it needs to brown.
Turn the heat down slightly
and keep frying the beef until
it is really brown on all sides.
Remove the first batch of
meat to a bowl and repeat
with the second half. Once
browned, remove the meat
from the pan, leaving behind
most of the fat. To this, add the
carrots, sliced into very thick
rounds. Get them browning
too, whilst you halve and slice
the onions thickly, with the
grain (ie. from root to tip). Add
them to the pan, and keep
frying. If at any point things
seem to be catching, add a
splash of water to that part of
the pan and stir to loosen it.
Return the beef to the pan,
and add a good handful of
flour, along with plenty of
ground black pepper and the
herbs. Keep stirring to get the
flour all cooked out, and get
rid of any lumps. Slice up the
garlic cloves and toss them in
with the crumbled stock cube,
before adding in the liquid of
your choosing – a nice amber
ale or a strong red would
work well, but so would box
wine or just water (fosters?).
Bring to the simmer and let
stew, uncovered – I would
advise anywhere from two-
four hours, depending on your
cut of beef. Finsh with worces-
tershire, and add the frozen
peas at the last minute.
