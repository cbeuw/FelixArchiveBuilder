Lara Bailey discusses how US politics will affect the future of our planet
A
man who
described
climate
change as
“created by
the Chinese”
and “fictional” is now the
leader of the free world.
The World Meteorological
Organisation, a UN body,
recently released data
showing that 2011 – 2015
have been the hottest years
on record. Moreover, many
extreme weather events that
occurred during this period
have been attributed to man-
made climate change. Now
is the time for unified, global
decisions to be made on tack-
ling climate change.
Trump has previously
threatened to pull out of
the UN Paris Agreement,
ratified by Obama. The Paris
Agreement is an agreement
within the UN Framework
Convention on Climate
Change covering greenhouse
gas emission mitigation and
adaptation to climate change.
Leaving the deal would only
be an option three years after
it had been in force, and it
came into action last Friday.
On top of this, it would take
a year to pull out. America
is responsible for 13% of
the Earth’s greenhouse gas
emissions, and under the
Paris agreement has agreed
to cut emissions by up to
28% by 2025. The legislative
promises made by the 200
pre-industrial revolution
levels). One of the world’s
biggest emitters going against
this deal would have huge
ramifications.
Back in May he pledged to
cut “$100 billion” of climate
change spending. In reality
the amount the Federacy
sends to the UN is lower, and
used to help global commu-
nities deal with the effects of
climate change. But with all of
his sweeping statements, you
have to use your imagination.
Cutting all of the Department
of Energy’s budget, climate
change research and funding
helping US communities
deal with extreme weather
events still would not produce
the $100 billion in savings
governments that signed the
deal are critical to ensuring
that global temperatures are
kept below the 2°C thresh-
old ( which is 2°C above
A Trump Presidency | a new era for
America... a disaster for Earth?
T
he 9th
of November saw tears,
despair and a whole lot of
memes as the results of the
2016 presidential election
rolled in. As I woke up to
BBC alerts of Trump’s win on
my phone, I found myself reliving that
fateful Friday morning in June – closing
my eyes, telling myself it was all a
dream and everything would return to
‘the expected’ when I checked again.
However, something is different. What
Brexit would mean to science was,
and still remains, quite uncertain,
but Trump’s science policies are
quite clear cut and, with Congress
backing, likely to be implemented.
Whether we’ll see a wall built
with the Mexico border is still
to be seen, but that we’ll live
through incredible changes in
American science policy is almost
guaranteed.
Analyses of Trump’s proposed
budget indicate catastrophic deficits,
with the government left to figure
out how to limit spending. Except for
NASA, Trump has not identified any
areas of scientific research worth
supporting, and most of his answers
about science spending focus on a
need to make ‘hard choices’ to meet
budget constraints.
Trump has also shown little to no
respect for general scientific findings
themselves. He has openly claimed

promised. In contrast, the
Clinton campaign set out
clear goals on the issue, and
Clinton pledged to make
America the “worlds clean
energy superpower”.
Trump has also apparently
backtracked on his words
about climate. In September
he said “there is still much
that needs to be investi-
gated in the field of climate
change”, and “we should
be focused on developing
energy sources and power
production that alleviates the
need for dependence of fossil
fuels”.
However unclear his inten-
tions, the clear anti-climate
statements should not be
ignored. Rising seas do not
negotiate.
that he believes in the link between
vaccinations and autism and that global
warming was “created by and for the
Chinese in order to make US manufactur-
ing non-competitive”. He has pledged to
reverse Obama’s regulations for climate
protection and withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement, which became effec-
tive five days before the results with the
promise of finally bringing forth change,
as well as to get rid of the Environmental
Protection Agency altogether. He also
has claimed that he wants to scrape
all federal spending on clean energy,
including wind, solar, nuclear power
and electric vehicles. Furthermore, his
anti-immigration policies have obvious
implications in terms of hindering efforts
to recruit scientists and STEM students
from abroad to US universities, a key for
scientific prowess.
The optimist in me has in vain been
searching for some silver lining in the
results of this election but science policies
are definitely not the answer. There is no
way around denying that Trump will lead
to a research effort focused purely on
short-term economic interests rather than
scientific endeavour itself, not to mention
a disaster for the planet, environmentally
speaking. Sad days for science it seems.
