are Imperial alumni. No prior
flying experience is required
to join us.
Gliding is an amazing
sport that allows you to
fly hundreds of kilometres,
perform thrilling aerobatics,
or simply enjoy the views
from the air. It is also among
the cheapest forms of flying
whilst on a student budget,
with large discounts for full-
time students. Loads more
information about the club is
available on our Facebook
page, website or just send us
an email. We’d love for you
to come and fly with us!
O
n a cold
Sunday
morning,
eight
members
of Imperial
College Gliding Club, both
new and experienced, set off
on an expedition to a new
airfield. Meeting on campus
at 6:30am was a small price
to pay for what lay ahead.
Parham is a small, quiet
airfield compared to our
home base Lasham, which is
surrounded by flat fields in
all directions. Parham offers
views of rolling hills and the
Southdowns ridge: a line of
chalk hills extending almost
200km ending at the south
coast.
We would be flying in our
own two-seat training glider,
a Grob 103C and a hired
Duo Discus. These were
towed to Parham in their
trailers by our Imperial alumni
instructors, Tom Arscott and
Guy Dutton.
Once we arrived at
Parham and rigged the
gliders, to ensure the
wings and tailplane were
securely attached, we got
flying! On the ridge, any
strong northerly wind will
be deflected up the hills,
providing rising air for gliders
to gain altitude. Gliders can
stay aloft for hours at a time
by flying back and forth
along the ridge.
Gliding above the ridge is
exhilarating. The continued
supply of energy enabled
us to make spectacularly
speedy low flights, following
the terrain of the ridge. We
were all able to have at least
one hour-long flight and two
of us were even able to fly in
formation together for two
hours, covering 60km on the
ridge.
We flew for as long as
possible, being the last to
land back at Parham, de-
rigging our gliders just before
darkness. The trip was a huge
success, with both returning
members of the club making
progress with training and
new members discovering the
thrills of gliding.
ICGC has its own fleet of
three modern gliders: one
two-seat trainer and two
glass-fibre, high-performance,
single-seat gliders. The club
is run by the students and
organises trips to Lasham
every Saturday and Sunday.
Training is done in the two-

rom the 27th
to 31st
of October 2016,
the 10th
China
Cup International
Regatta was hosted
in Shenzhen,
attracting over 140 teams
from all over the world
including Russia, the USA,
Australia and Germany,
amongst others. Imperial
College Yacht Club (ICYC)
sent out Team Imperial,
comprised of students and
alumni from Imperial, Oxford
and Cambridge Universities.
They were participating as
the only British boat in the
Regatta, the first time in
seven years a British boat has
competed in the event.
The crew consisted of nine
members, brought together
by Bob Xu, the president
of ICYC, and skippered by
Robert Page, an Imperial
alumni and a member of the
Royal Ocean Racing Club.
After a few days practicing
together as a team for the
first time, the racing kicked off
with a day passage race from
Hong Kong to Shenzhen,
where the majority of the
racing was held.
Despite being agonisingly
close to the finish, the pas-
sage race was called off due
to the lack of wind before any
of the First 40.7 class could
finish. After navigating Chi-
nese immigration, the team
managed to get to the hotel
and got some much deserved
rest to ready themselves for
the races to come.
Over the next three days,
competing with a host of
experienced teams, including
professionals from New Zea-
land and Beneteau America,
the Imperial boat performed
extremely well in their first
international regatta and first
time racing together. After the
four days of racing, thanks
to strong racing tactics and
excellent teamwork onboard
(and despite frustration from
changeable conditions), Team
Imperial managed to achieve
positions of 9th
, 15th
, 19th
, 11th
and 13th
. This gave an impres-
sive overall placement of 14th
out of 25, beating Beneteau
Asia, as well as crews from
Russia, Canada, Germany
and Australia amongst others.
ICYC would like to take
this opportunity to thank the
Italian renewable energy firm
Chemtech Solar, especially
its Managing Partner, Ms.
Chery Zeng, for her generous
funding to make this journey
possible.
ICYC is recognised as the
only student-led yacht club
in London. ICYC’s next race
will be April 2017 in France,
attending the EDHEC Sail-
ing Cup (Course Croisière
EDHEC), also known as
the biggest student sailing
regatta in Europe. This will be
a historical entry as the last
time Imperial participated in
EDHEC was back in 1980s.
