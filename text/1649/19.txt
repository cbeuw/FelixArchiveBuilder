each before KCL ultimately
managed to dominate the
final match and proceed to
the finals.
Inbetween matches, there
were interviews and talks to
tone things down. One high-
light talk was on ‘Esports and
Competitive gaming in the
UK: A Summary and Future
Possibilities’. It was basically
about how e-sports is still a
relatively new ‘thing’ and how
people don’t really treat com-
petitive gaming in the same
E
sports have rapidly
been gaining
popularity recently
and have been
making a name for
themselves across
the gaming community.
However, despite this spike
in popularity, they have
yet to be taken seriously or
started building a community,
bringing like-minded people
together. An organisation
called Varsity Games is
the first to aim at rectifying
this injustice and it’s began
with an all-out DOTA 2
tournament which took place
last Saturday on the 26th
of
November.
The tournament took place
at the Gfinity Arena in Fulham
Broadway with teams from
games between two teams,
with a best-two-out-of-three
competition in each game,
each competing for honour
and glory. The winners of the
games would then proceed
to the finals for a game that
would decide the winner of
the Varsity Games London
Trophy.
When I arrived at the
venue, I was immediately
struck by the professional-
ism and skill involved in the
setup. For those of you who
don’t know, the Gfnity arena
is located at Vue Fulham
Broadway. The game was
live-streamed onto the big
screen and the audience
watched from the comfort of
cinema seats we all know and
love. The teams playing had
their own booths right in front
of the screens with some of
the best computer setups I’ve
seen and technicians on hand
to fix any technical issues.
Everyone was presented with
video interviews of all the
teams, with the members shar-
ing stories from their early
gaming days and their teams’
journey working together.
The tournament got into
full swing with the first game
between UCL and KCL. The
two teams both selected
their characters and the
countdown began to the first
game. Once it began, there
was a frenzy of spells, deaths
and characters dodging and
attacking wherever possible.
There was also live commen-
tary, which only added to the
excitement and got everyone
hyped. Even I was enjoy-
ing myself, in spite of never
having played or watched
a game of DOTA in my life.
The two teams were pretty
evenly-matched and that led
to some intense and exciting
viewing. Both teams won one
way as conventional sports.
Varsity Games restated their
aims on how they want things
to change and help gaming
become serious. Plus we got
treated to a free drink AND a
hot dog! #Profit.
The next game was between
Imperial College and LSE.
Imperial fought bravely
but ultimately they lost two
matches and were unable to
progress to the finals (Never
mind lads! You’ll do better
next time). That meant the
final was to be between KCL
and LSE but before the match
could start, there was a delay
due to technical difficulties.
This was blamed on DOTA
needing an update that was
expected to come in the next
couple of weeks. There was
just was enough time for me
to drop out, queue for food,
leave because it would take
too long, and arrive for the
start of the first match.
As the final began, KCL
were able to dominate the
first match. For the second
match, LSE tried a tactic
that took the entire room by
surprise but that ultimately
paid off, helping them win the
second match. Finally the last
match of the day was under-
way, to decide the winner of
the tournament. Both teams
started off on equal footing,
but slowly LSE were able to
take the lead and gain the
upper hand, winning the
final match, and in turn, the
tournament.
The LSE team members
rushed on stage, beaming
triumphantly. The team
raised the trophy in unison,
Varsity Games at Gfinity
thus capping the first Varsity
Games tournament. After
a final round of interviews,
and a round of applause for
the organising team and the
Gfinity crew, the event was
officially over and everyone
dispersed.
All in all, the event was
successful and well executed:
definitely worth spending my
entire Saturday on. Varsity
Games plan to expand and
have more events, with a
larger variety of games.
With regards to promoting
esports, the organising team
definitely did a good job and
I’m eagerly looking forward
to the next one.
