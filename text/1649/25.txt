This week you miss
the bus to the airport
because you couldn’t
make up your mind if
you want to take the bus
or the train. Or is it the
train you actually miss?
Make up your mind!

This week your
personal tutor reminds
you that reading the
newspaper doesn’t
count as “outside
reading”. You live in
hope though, maybe
the College will
change this policy next
year.
This week you decide
you want to generate
a bigger social media
following. Stop.
Posting. Everything.
On. Facebook. Like
seriously, don’t take a
picture of this and post
it.
This week you
finally get into the
Christmas spirit, and
by Christmas spirit we
mean eggnog.
This week you’re a
vegan and are deeply
upset that banknotes
contain trace amounts of
cow. Guess that means
you’re gonna have to stop
eating them now.
This week you dump
your girlfriend via a text
message and then fly
to another country. You
wonder why she wants
to track you down and
maybe …kill you?
This week you go
to a society general
meeting, but nobody
else came. Good thing
you don’t need quorum!
This week you bring
in a giant gingerbread
house to try and make
friends. Friendship
cannot be bought with
food. Stop trying.
This week you realise
you can’t remember
Wednesday night when
you actually stayed up
late in the library to
study. No wonder you
don’t, because you were
actually at ACC.
This week you stage
a sit in at the Union bar
to protest their drinks
fee rises. You spend
the whole day in there,
drinking and eating
curly fries. Not much
different to last week to
be honest.
This week you realise that
If you reduce the amount
of coffee you drink,
you’ll actually get some
sleep and then stop day-
dreaming in lectures. No?
Okay, get me a latte then.
This week you notice
advent calendars are
declining in popularity.
Their days are
numbered.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m having a major life crisis. Christmas is approaching
and I’m feeling really unhealthy. Everyone in the office has
started Christmas baking. There’s cake in here every day.
Some of it is good, some of it is bad but I don’t fucking
care. IT’S CAKE! I I’ve been eating three to four slices a
day. I went to a fortune teller at a christmas market and
she saw DIABETES in my future :’( I don’t know how to quit.
The other day a piece of cake fell into a petri dish and I
automatically picked it up and shoved it in my mouth. That
petri dish had a staphylococcus culture in it. Help!
Best,
M Berry [Staff]
HOROSCOPES
M dearest,
I understand your struggle. I LOVE the holi-
days. Gingerbread, packing that fiery punch,
lebküchen (which is just german gingerbread
so it also pucks a fiery punch, only it’s rougher
and wears leather ‘cause, you know, it’s
German), christmas pudding, perfectly aged
just like nan, christmas cake, drowned in
enough alcohol to kill a rugby team, just like
nan. Dear GOD just writing this is giving me a
sugar rush. Gimme a sec need to grab some
maltesers from the cupboard.
Sooooo where were we…. Oh yes. Gurl I feel
ya. If I had a pound (sterling) for every slice of
cake I’ve had these past couple of weeks… Like
yesterday I was stuffing my face with the choc-
olatiest, richest, fattiest, yule log (the dessert
kind), and the day before someone brought in
these mince pies that I couldn’t stop eating. I
mean they were shit. They were overcooked
and the filling was at best questionable but
there’s just something about mince pies that
makes them irresistible. And omg the candy
canes. Don’t even get me started on the sugary
delights that candy canes are.
So… as I was saying…. I’m not sure what we
were talking about to be honest and I really
need to go cause I have a Christmas dinner to
attend in ten minutes.
Anyway good luck with the staphylococcus!
Sounds delicious!
Big luv,
Chris xxxxx
