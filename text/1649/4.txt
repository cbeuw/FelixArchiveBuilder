further until last year when we
approached the Union again
(of course, everyone who had
initially inquired had already
graduated) to which they said
similar things.
“It was only until this year
that we managed to secure a
refurbishment to the building.
I think having the building
over what exactly to do with
the building we’re in. So
while a major refurbishment is
definitely (hopefully) coming
to us in the near future, we’re
going to have to wait for
the college to go through
their channels before we
actually know what exactly is
happening” says el-Turk.
Jailbreakers return breaking past records
Turns out people really want to get away from Imperial
Lef Apostolakis
A
s another
year nears its
conclusion so
does another
J a i l b r e a k
c h a l l e n g e .
This year’s annual travelling
competition, organised by IC
RAG, broke the previously
held record for participation,
as well as for distance
travelled by a single team.
The winners Ayush Dharap
and Rohan Prasad from team
Brownian Motion, managed
to reach Bali, Indonesia, a
whopping 12,500km away
(or a return trip to the centre
of the Earth) raising £355.88
In the process.
The key to their success, they
claim, was planning. “As soon
as we committed to doing
Jailbreak we were set on
breaking the Imperial record
of Singapore. We thought
preliminary fundraising would
be a good opportunity to
test the waters, and to get a
headstart on raising money
for our charities... We noticed
how few people carried cash
on them – because of this
we set up a separate online
donation page for the day of
Jailbreak. Using technology
was an effective solution, and
we raised £200 from here.”
On the day of Jailbreak,
Brownian Motion hit the busy
London streets and managed
to raise £700. This allowed
them to book flights to Dubai
only to almost immediately
cancel the tickets to buy flights
to Bali, a good 7,000 km
further away yet still within
budget (return costs were
covered by the Jailbreaking
teams). Almost 24 hours later,
Brownian Motion checked
themselves in a luxurious four
star hotel, having broken the
previous Singapore record.
But Brownian Motion weren’t
the only team to achieve
impressive distances this year.
Over half the participating
teams reached the 1,000 km
mark, and over a quarter of
the teams surpassed the 2,000
km mark.
In not so close but equally
astonishing second place,
rip harambe travelled
an impressive 4,515 km,
managing to reach Gambia
in the process. Team rip
harambe, consisting of first
year medic Benjamin Jones
and his climbing partner,
second year Southampton
computing student Samuel
Law, achieved their mission
by identifying the destination
with the best distance to price
ratio the night before. (“Our
dreams of Kazakhstan were
dashed by a long stopover in
Moscow”).
2016’s Jailbreak challenge
went a lot smoother this time
round. Last year, one of IC
RAG’s Jailbreak teams got
pulled off a flight to Turkey
after terror suspicions (it
was all a misunderstanding).
Despite the lack of drama this
year, there were still surprises.
“I spent £36 on 3G sending a
Snapchat, which was fun”, says
Jones of team rip harambe,
who we hope will think twice
next time he enables data
roaming in Gambia.
Though Jailbreak is often
criticised when donation
money is spent on travelling
expenses, teams are expected
to pay for their journeys back
and they usually also acquire
sponsorship per mile travelled,
so in the end, despite travel
costs, the fundraiser yields
significant proceeds. RAG
chair, Cynfelyn Nancarrow-
Lei, said “ [We tried] to create
\\ Our dreams
of Kazakhstan
were dashed by a
long stopover in
Moscow \\
a per-mile sponsorship form
prior to the Jailbreak, so that
you raise more for Charity
after the Jailbreak (when you
know how many miles you
have travelled) than you do
for flights during the event.
I really pushed that this year
in the presentation I gave and
in emails and social media.
Unfortunately the winning
team didn’t adopt this method.
If they did they could be
raising a hell of a lot more.
Most other teams will however
did take our advice.”
The top two teams (distance-
wise), Brownian Motion
and rip harambe, have so
far raised £355 and £435
respectively. In total this year’s
jailbreak has raised £10,000
so far but is expecting to
raise somewhere between
£15,000 and £20,000 by
the end of term. Donations

Honorable mentions include:
Dora the explorers, consisting
of Lindsay Reid and Priya
Gupta, who raised £500, yet
only managed to cover 3.6km
(I cover more distance during
my commute to work).
The High Five (who ironically
consist of four members, as
the fifth member forgot to
register online) managed
to raise £ 1,936 yet only
travelled 6.7km, bagging the
top fundraising team prize in
the process.
Teams The Hitchhiking
Honey’s and Shallow End
Club who travelled the furthest
in the UK and exclusively via
hitchhiking respectively (that’s
the spirit).
Tequila Mockingbird,
Teletubbies, and Gimperial
also scored points for their
excellent name choices.
Celebrations will take place
next week (info to be released
on IC RAG’s Facebook page).
Due to the event’s success this
year, another round will be
taking place in Spring.
Prayer Room refurbishment
Long overdue works are set to be started
Lef Apostolakis
manager visit and see the state
of the room really helped. We
still might be getting moved
out soon, but we’ll have a fully
refurbished room while we
wait.”
The refurbishment was
agreed after DPFS and
DPCS met with the Head of
Estates, who has arranged
for the works to take place
during the Winter break. In
the meantime the Union, in
conjunction with College,
will locate an appropriate
space for members of Islamic
Society to pray, which takes
into consideration the club’s
needs such as proximity to
washroom facilities. The finer
details of the refurbishment
are still under negotiation.
P
lans to restore
the Brothers’
Prayer Room to an
acceptable condition
are underway after
the issue was brought
to the attention of DP Finance
and DP Clubs and Societies
at the beginning of term. The
prayer room is managed
by IC’s Islamic Society, and
located at 9B Princes Gardens.
The prayer room has been
in a “sub-optimal state for
some years now”, according
to Mazen el-Turk, chair of
Islamic Society but currently
the group is in discussions with
the Union and College about
a refurbishment.
“The College is currently
having their own discussions
The prayer room is suffering
from a number of maintenance
issues, including a dirty carpet
emitting a strong smell, damp
on the walls, and peeling
wallpaper. All of these issues
are exacerbated by poor
ventilation.
“We first approached the
Union to fix this about six
years ago. We were told
then that we might be moving
out of the room soon, so we
should wait and see what
happens. We were mainly
told this as we were planning
to spend our own money
on the refurbishment, and
the Union did not want us
wasting a few thousand for
no reason. After that, we
didn’t really pursue the matter
LifeSciences:‘Collegesayssexualassault=bad’
Department sends weird email mentioning sexual assault incident Lef Apostolakis
A
n email was
sent out on
Wednesday,
to the
Department of
Life Sciences,
informing recipients of a
serious incident of sexual
assault taking place last year
between members of the
department.
The email was signed off
by Professor Murray Selkirk
(Head of Department),
Professor Neil, Fairweather
(Postgraduate Tutor), Dr
Stuart Haslam (Senior Tutor,
Biochemistry) and Professor
Pietro Spanu (Senior Tutor,
Biological Sciences).
The precise wording of
the communication was: “It
has come to light that, last
year, a serious incident of
sexual assault took place
between students of our
Department. The College
and the Department of Life
Sciences take the view that
such behaviour is completely
unacceptable.
“We take this opportunity
to remind you of the official
college policies on this, as
well as advice for anyone who
may have been involved in
any incident of this kind”
The email also included
links to College’s Harassment,
Bullying and Victimisation
policy, as well as to a College
page with resources for victims
of sexual assault.
It is unclear why the
department of Life
Sciences chose this line of
communication, the sole
purpose of which seems to
be a reminder to the student
body of the College finding
such behaviour “completely
unacceptable” – one would
hope that the fact that sexual
assault is illegal should suffice.
However it is likely that
there has been more than
one incident, with victims
choosing not to come forth
with allegations yet.
This email might be an
attempt to reach out and
support silent victims who
may have failed to seek
appropriate support.
We tried contacting Imperial
College and the Department
of Life Sciences to divulge the
circumstances under which
the sexaul assault took place,
but no specifics have been
released, such as whether
the assault was reported to
the police, or whether any
disciplinary action was taken.
An official statement read
that “The College’s priority
is always the safety and
wellbeing of its students and
staff. Any kind of sexual
violence or harassment has no

place within our community.
We treat any allegation of
sexual assault with the utmost
seriousness.
“Students would always
be encouraged to contact
the police if they feel they
have been the victim of any
crime. Any student who has
experienced sexual violence
and who would like to talk
to a member of the College
can contact the College
Tutors, their personal tutor,
Hall Wardens, or the student
counselling service for advice
and support.”
We have yet to receive a
reply from the Department of
Life Sciences.
