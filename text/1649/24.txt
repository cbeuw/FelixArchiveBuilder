ike my weak-willed
scrounger of the state
counterpart to my left, I
too believe that there is
a disability that is hidden
under the surface of this
politically correct prison. This
disability is known as being a
woman. Now before your wives/
girlfriends/assorted mistresses start
getting menstrual and forgetting
their place, let me clarify: most
women are disabled. If they
aren’t disabled, then why do they
consistently get paid less for doing
the same job as a man? The reason
for this is that the female brain is
scientifically proven to be smaller
than that of men (I know this is true
because I read it in the Bible), and
indeed they find it more difficult
to do simple tasks because they
are always worrying about their
biological clock ticking away.
Furthermore, it has been proven
that these poor women, who have
not been told they were born with
a feminine disability, took almost
twice the amount of time a man
would taken to get the job done
as they were too busy looking for
potential partners and crying. Sir
Tim Hunt told me so.
Another disability that women
face is the fact that they are
medically weaker and often find
it difficult to fight muggers. It
seems they are unable to use the
muscles in their, um, lady parts,
in order to fight other people. I
mean, you must be retarded if
you haven’t realised you can just
train it like any muscle. I saw this
documentary called Teeth a few
year’s ago and this woman was
so far advanced (not evolved,
OK thought police!) that she had
trained her, um, delicate flower, to
bite on the cocks of weaker men.
Come on ladies! If feminism is so
great, why haven’t you all been
doing this???
I imagine the majority of my
readers will not have understood
the reference I just made to what
is a common mental retardation
called meminism among women. In
fact this condition is infective, and
is on it’s fourth infective wave of
this epidemic. It leads to some even
believing that they can be presi-
dent, which of course we all know
is a crazy impossibility. So please,
for the price of a Daily Mail, you
can help us finally alleviate the
suffering that these poor women
feel by allowing them to live their
dreams of being somebody’s wife.
T
his week, dearest
readers, I want to write
to you about a disability.
This is a disability that
has no charity, has no
representation, and has
no-one spreading awareness. This
disability is known as not caring
enough about the environment.
Now admittedly all I have is a
degree in psychology from UCL,
so it doesn’t really count for much;
however, this degree has given me
the ability to diagnose people with
illnesses that they didn’t even know
they had, so I think I’m basically
the same as a science doctor.
From my various experiments
I have deduced that this illness
probably has something to do with
the brain. Of course I say experi-
ments, but what I really mean is I
sat down and thought about what
people sometimes do and gave a
scary name to it. From this vague
set of assumptions, I have also
concluded that it has something to
do with bacon somehow getting
into the bloodstream and causing
people to stop care about animals,
trees, and the eternal life force that
guides us all, mother Gaia. It is
called Pigirrumatoris.
This disability means that there
are people among us who are
literally incapable of stopping
themselves from putting animal
products into their mouth, and so
can’t fully experience the sheer
majesty of tofu and vegan cheese.
Honestly I would rather have both
my legs amputated and scoop my
eyeballs out with a spoon than use
one of those new five pound notes
with their microscopic-traceable
amounts of an animal fat byprod-
uct WHICH IS DISGUSTING AND
HONESTLY I NEVER EXPECTED
MARK CAIRNEY TO BETRAY
ME LIKE THIS. Anyway, as I was
saying, people who don’t overre-
act to small things like this have
obviously got something medically
wrong with them. How hard is it
to empathise with a cow, I mean
really? If you squint hard enough
they even look like us, if not a
better version since the consume so
many more whole wheat grains.
The treatment for this, I believe,
is not accepting that everyone has
different opinions about animals
and their importance, and high
doses of kale take on a regular
basis. I have a friend who was
once in the throes of Pigirrumatoris
but luckily due to my intervention
of taking all the fun and joy from
his life, he can properly experience
what it’s like to be a normal human
bean. I mean human being.
If you aren’t vegan,
you clearly have a
mental degeneracy
