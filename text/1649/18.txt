t’s been a while since
Pokémon Go’s surprise
popularity peak, but with
the release of the latest
games, Sun and Moon,
the Pokémon franchise
is back in the limelight. The
new games offer a fresh and
updated take on the title while
still staying true to the original
formula; they remind us why
the series is still so popular
after 20 years.
One of the largest changes
these games have brought is
the Island Challenge, in the
new Hawaii-themed region
of Alola. This is a refreshing
change of pace from the pre-
vious games’ usual setup of
beating gyms and collecting
badges. The challenges come
in all sorts of forms, including
a scavenger hunt, memorising
dance moves and tailing after
some water pokémon. These
challenges are integrated
with the new environment,
making you explore the new
area and helping Alola feel
like its own region rather
than an overworld map. The
Challenges prevent things
from getting too mindless,
sometimes showing up
unexpectedly, and make you
constantly fine-tune your team
while always being on alert.
The rewards of complet-
ing these challenges are
Z-crystals, the new feature
created for this generation.
These help spice up battles
and don’t feel as gimmicky
making it feel like a moving
story, à la the animé.
As you progress through the
world, there are a number
of interesting and unique
characters you meet who
add their own flair to the mix.
There’s the new Pokémon
Professor, Kukai, who is per-
manently shirtless and always
ready to get into the thick of
things. There’s also Lillie, a
character with a mysterious
past, and your fun-loving rival
Hau. There’s even someone
who’s similar to the edgier,
douchebag rivals of the old
games, namely Gladion,who’s
obsessed with beating you.
The trial captains themselves
have more personality than
the old gym leaders due to
how much they’re involved in
the Island Challenges and not
confined to gyms.
But, of course, this wouldn’t
be a Pokémon game without
the pokémon and these
games do not disappoint.
Apart from the 80 or so new
Pokémon (bringing the total
to over 800!) there are also
regional variants of some
older Pokémon. Once again,
they are in line with the
nature of Alola, with designs
and characteristics that make
sense for the region. For
example, the Alolan form of
Exeggutor, apart from now
being a grass and dragon
type, is huge and basically
resembles a palm tree. The
games capitalise on the
fact that there are so many
pokémon now, letting you
catch a wide variety right
as the trailers made them out
to be. The basic gist is that
Z-crystals allow Pokémon
to use Z-Moves, which can
only be used once per battle
and have varying effects.

Pokémon Sun and Moon is
out on the Nintendo 3DS
whereas others can be status
changes. The rest of the bat-
tling system remains the same
as before with some minor
tweaks like knowing the type
effectiveness of your moves,
and the new Battle Royale,
which is a free-for-all match
between four players.
With a 30-plus hour
story mode, these games
are largely focused on
world-building. They are
written and made in a way
that makes you focus on
the journey and adventure,
rather than grind towards the
end. The plot is enjoyable
and helps stitch the entire
game together, even if it isn’t
particularly special and a bit
predictable. There is an air of
general mystique that draws
you forward and lets the char-
acters speak for themselves.
This game in particular has a
larger emphasis on cutscenes,

from the start. This makes
team-building more fun and
enjoyable as opposed to
before when you were stuck
with birds and bugs for the
first three routes or so.
The very outdated system of
HM’s has also been removed
and is now replaced with
Pokémon Ride, which fulfills
the same purpose while being
more fun and enjoyable. This
also means you can have a
full team of Pokémon that
you like, rather than having
one or two as obligatory HM
slaves.
Pokémon Sun and Moon
can arguably be considered
the best games in the series
released up until now. They’ve
rejuvenated the system while
keeping the original DNA
enough that new players can
easily jump in while older
players can still play with a
sense of familiarity. It’ll be
intriguing to see where the
series goes next, because
Sun and Moon is clearly the
beginning of a new era rather
than the end of an old one.
