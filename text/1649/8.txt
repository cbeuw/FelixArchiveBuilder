eing made an
adjective is a
double-edged
sword. Take
pity on Kafka –
while having an
eponymous adjective may
mean your style has made
its lasting mark on popular
culture, it also means that it
has become ripe for parody;
never mind the legions
Farahani plays his wife
Laura, who turns her hand to
numerous creative endeav-
ours, and dreams of being
a black-and-white-outfitted
cupcake-baking country-star.
The film covers a week in
Paterson’s life, and the routine
is immediately established:
waking early, Paterson drives
his bus around the city,
eavesdropping on the pas-
sengers and writing poetry
in his breaks while his wife
paints and makes new outfits;
returning home, he walks his
dog and stops off at a bar
for a beer. The scene fades
to black, and the new day
dawns.
And that’s pretty much
it. The days aren’t all the
same, but very little actually
happens. There’s no grand
narrative arc, no crucial
denouement – in essence, Jar-
musch rejects the conventional
trappings of screenwriting.
But Paterson is all the better
for it: through paring down
the plot, Jarmusch strips away
any extraneous flesh, leaving
a clean bone of a film – one
an inner strength as true and
clear as the waterfall Pater-
son goes to every lunch-break
for inspiration.
Paterson operates on one
level as a rejection of modern
life, made not in anger, but
in quiet dignity, and a heroic
tribute to blue-collar America:
Paterson refuses to use a
cell-phone, surrounds himself
with mid-century design, and
hides away in a basement
den stacked with books and
DIY paraphernalia. But it is
far from a one-sided assault
on modernity: Laura uses a
laptop and a tablet, and Pat-
erson never makes any form
of grand statement about
why he eschews technology.
With Paterson, Jarmusch is
not railing against the horror
of screen-burn. Instead, he
is encouraging us all to stop
and look around, to take in
the wonderful magic of every-
day life.
‘They’re just words,’ Pat-
erson says towards the end
of the film, referring to the
poems in his notebook. Yes,
words may only be words,
but in Paterson, Jarmusch has
managed so masterfully to
use spoken words to conjure
up a fantastical tone poem,
one whose strength lies in
its stoic dignity. Paterson is
a truly generous film, one
that – to bastardize William
Carlos Williams somewhat
– is so sweet and so cool,
in equal measures. It is an
uplifting display of hope in
these trying times: hope in the
innate goodness of the human
spirit, in the healing power of
creativity, and in the essential
beauty of everyday life.

JimJarmusch’slatestworkPaterson
is a breathtaking exploration
of day-to-day life, blissful love,
and the sheer power of poetry.
\\ Jarmusch has
created a many-
layered film that
belies its simple
premise, and merits
repeat viewings \\
that can powerfully yet subtly
show off its best attributes.
The dialogue, as you would
expect from Jarmusch, is
simply superb, completely
nailing the wandering nature
of conversational speech; it’s
like being an intimate witness
into dozens of fascinating
conversations, allowing us
to revel in the simple power
of language. Cues and refer-
ences in the script are brought
back again and again, both
visually and through speech,
creating a many-layered film
that belies its simple premise,
and merits repeat viewings.
Driver is on superlative form
here, easily delivering his best
performance on screen yet.
His Paterson is – compared
to those around him – a quiet
cypher, one who is more
comfortable listening than
talking, and stands at the eye
of a cyclone of conversation;
the majority of his lines come
in the form of a voice-over
of him reading his free-verse
poems, written by New
York School member Ron
Padgett. Driver displays great
bravery in taking on this role:
poetry reading, especially in
films, has associations with
over-dramatisation and poor
writing skills. Driver and
Jarmusch eschew the easy
option, which would have
Driver reading out obviously
poor-quality work; instead,
Driver lovingly gives the
poems the attention and care
they deserve, but no more,
making them all the more
A nuanced study of domestic bliss \\ Soda Pictures
A stunning
study of
everyday
beauty
of individuals who use
Kafkaesque as a synonym
for ‘dark’, ‘alienating’, or
‘pertaining to queues’. As
such, perhaps American
director Jim Jarmusch
should be worried: over
his last eleven films, since
his directorial debut in
1980, Jarmusch has carved
out a niche for himself in
independent American
cinema with his trademark
style. Going into a Jarmusch
film, you sort of know what to
expect: reels of exceptionally-
crafted dialogue; an
industrial, washed-out
soundtrack; and probably
a cameo from Tom Waits.
Surely it’s only a matter of
time before ‘Jarmuschian’
enters into our popular
lexicon.
On paper, Paterson, his 12th
film, finds Jarmusch treading
dangerously close to the
realm of self-parody: Adam
Driver stars as Paterson, a
bus driver living in Paterson,
New Jersey with a penchant
for modernist American
poetry, particularly William
Carlos Williams, and his epic
poem Paterson; Golshifteh

Laura, whose creative inter-
ests pull her in a multitude of
different directions. A lesser

a scatterbrain, a dilettante

James Marsh is acclaimed as
one of the best documentarians
working today. Ben Collier takes
a look at two of his most famous
works, Man on Wire and Project
Nim, to latest if the man can live
up to all that hype (spoiler: not
really...)
I
often hear people sing
the praises of director
James Marsh and his two
supposed classics Project
Nim and Man on Wire.
Having recently seen
both films, I thought it would
be interesting to present my
reviews this week in tandem.
The reason for this is that I
noticed a lot of similarities
in presentation and subject
matter between these two
films… I also bloody hated
one and quite liked the other.
It just so happens that Man
on Wire – which fell under
the “bloody hated it” banner
– was the first of the two I
chose to watch. It documents
the life of French gymnast
Philippe Petit, an eccentric
tight-rope walker, most well
known for his stunt-walk
between the twin towers.
Whilst I ultimately see this
feat as slightly overhyped,
it was undeniably big news
in its time and therefore a
seemingly good subject for
a documentary. Overall, the
‘feel’ of the film is competent
enough and the editing is
adequate, if lacking a certain
energy. The problem with
the film is simply its content:
unless you like seeing people
parroting endless, repetitive
praise for two hours, hyping
up an event for which there
only exists four photographs
and is over in five minutes, I
wouldn’t recommend it.
The main problem here is
Philippe. He comes across as
a selfish, self-aggrandising
egotist and, unlike in Project
Nim, no one featured in the
film seems to question what a
horrible man he is. For exam-
ple, at one point Philippe talks
about cheating on his long
term girlfriend immediately
after completing his walk and
the story is romantically used
to make Philippe seem oh-so
passionate and mysterious.
Later on, Philippe allows
the same girlfriend (along
with many friends) to be
extradited from the US and
cuts contact with them. This
act isn’t condemned at all,
beyond one of his friends
showing a bit of emotion
when he talks about quickly
forgiving him. With not one
dissenting voice in the entire
documentary, I am forced to
believe that Marsh intended
me to root for (maybe even
like?) this man.
The recreations of Philippe
and his team sneaking their
equipment into the towers
was initially going to be the
one redeeming aspect of
this film. However, a quick
Google search reveals that
almost all of the story was
exaggerated or completely
made up in an attempt to
make Philippe appear more
daring and rebellious than he
actually was. Whilst I under-
stand the need to dramatize
the real world for the sake of
an engaging story (The Cove
did this well, for example) this
part of the film just made me
feel lied to. Ultimately, Man
on Wire is not the awe-inspir-
ing masterpiece I’ve heard
numerous critics describe
it as. It’s an overly long,
hero-worshipping, and unfor-
givably boring film about a
man who deserves absolutely
none of your attention.
§
I think it’s time for a bit more
positivity. Pleasingly, the 2011
feature Project Nim, also
directed by Marsh, succeeds
in a lot of places that Man on
Wire fails. The documentary
describes a controversial
study from the 1980s, which
investigated whether a chim-
panzee (Nim) could be taught
sign language and communi-
cate with humans. When the
project ends in failure, Nim
finds himself in ever direr situ-
ations before dying at a very
young age.
It is the experiment itself, run
by Dr Herbert ‘Herb’ Terrace,
that makes up the bulk of the
running time. Manipulative
and selfish, Herb is almost
as unlikable a character as
Man on Wire’s Philippe Petit:
beyond merely his character,
Herb’s experiment – which
seemed to take a back seat
to Herb sleeping with all of
his students – is ultimately
presented as pseudo-scien-
tific nonsense. The idea of
taking a baby chimp from
his mother and entrusting a
clueless, upper-middle class
hippy family to then teach it
sign language during ado-
lescence is a wholly pointless
scientific endeavour in my
eyes. What’s important here
is that there is a difference
in how Herb (in contrast to
Philippe) is presented to us by
the director. Where Philippe
was showcased in a romanti-
cised light and talked about
exclusively by his hero-wor-
shiping ‘friends’, Herb – and
his experiment – are actually
challenged. He isn’t free from
scrutiny as Philippe seemed to
be, allowing the film to focus
on an unlikable man and
have it not ruin the expe-
rience. I, for one, actually
loved to hate him.
I felt a similar way towards
Nim’s first human ‘mother’
Stephanie LaFarge. In our first
act we see a lot of Stephanie
raising Nim like a human child
in her bourgeois-bohemian
New York mansion. What’s
different about Stephanie
is that she is so ridiculous,
indulgent, and stupid that
she doesn’t even require any
runtime being set aside for
criticism. Anthropomorphising
her little ‘child’ constantly,
Stephanie at one point speaks
about trying to smoke weed
with Nim and even discusses
sexual tension between the
two… I wish I were joking.
In most other aspects the
film is perfectly passable.
The post-production job here
was obviously monumental,
and the filmmakers did well
to establish a steady pace
and coherent story line. Just
as a little aside to finish on
­­
– I wasn’t a fan of the fact
that all the interviews took
place in front of generic grey
background. I have always
considered it much more
effective when documen-
tarians film their subjects in
somewhere more personal
to their interviewee. Fictional
films do not have a monopoly
on the use of mise-en-scène,
and by choosing interesting
and personal locations we
can often gain an under-
standing of characters. Since
characters are the driving
force in these two films, it’s a
small change that would have
added a lot.
