Imperial
doesn’t need
your money
Alexandre Adler explains why we
should fight tuition fees at Imperial
A
spectre is
haunting Impe-
rial: the spec-
tre of tuition
fees. Six years
ago now, the
conservative-led government
tripled fees, expanding on a
policy started by New Labour.
Students around the country
rose up in protest, but to no
avail. Since then, young Brit-
ons have depended on gov-
ernment loans, meaning that
they start their professional life
in debt. The poorest students
have meagre grants, and EU
citizens just have to spit out the
cash. Overseas students, some
coming from less affluent parts
of the world, naturally have
to pay two to three times the
price.
One could reasonably ex-
pect that Imperial used these
new revenues to enhance its
student experience, or the
volume and quality of its re-
search.
A quick look at the college’s
own financial statement dis-
pels this impression immedi-
ately. So shall we look at the
numbers?
For the year 2014-2015, the
last for which such a statement
is available as of this arti-
cle’s writing, Imperial posted
a £129 million surplus, or a
13% profit, up from an £85
million surplus in 2014 thanks
to the inclusion of a one-off
Research & Development gov-
ernment credit. Without it, the
surplus for 2015 would stand
at a respectable £82.1 mil-
lion. The really funny thing is
that this amount exceeds the
total fees paid by British and
EU students by £18 million.
That’s right, Imperial could
offer every one of its EU and
British students a free ride and
still manage to have a surplus.
(Thank god the financial state-
ment also contains a public
benefit statement that includes
this sentence: “The College
offers one of the most gener-
ous overall student financial
support packages in the UK.”)
Alternatively, for the same
amount, it could halve the fees
paid by overseas students. But
College apparently has other
priorities, and estimates that it
needs this surplus every year
to achieve other goals.
If you think that this is ex-
plained by greater investment
in research, then you may be
slightly mistaken – the sum
of academic staff salaries,
salaries from grants, and the
amount spent on research
grants and contracts are all
completely covered by fund-
ing council grants and Imperi-
al’s research income. (In fact,
the difference comes in at £50
million of extra income.)
No, these surpluses are
funnelled into paying for Im-
perial’s asset expansion pol-
icy. Forget Nobel prizes and
scholarships – the priority is
real estate. As prices in Lon-
don have continued to grow,
the College has acquired
more and more buildings,
from South Kensington’s post
office (£18.2 million), to post-
graduate accommodation for
its GradPad venture (£98.1
million), to its “Research and
Translation Hub” (£32.9 mil-
lion). This brings the College’s
assets to a glorious £1.4 bil-
lion. That’s right, Imperial is
a billionaire from real estate,
just like that orange man you
see a lot in the newspaper.
And just like Mr. “Cuckwork
Orange” (reusing one of his
fans’ favourite expressions),
Imperial also has trouble de-
livering good returns on in-
vestments. The College has
a large endowment fund of
around £113 million, which re-
turned an unimpressive £1.7
million last year. Some of it
could maybe be attributed to
the profits being re-injected
into the fund (the statement
doesn’t specify whether or not
this is the case), but it clearly
is dismal when compared to
the performance of the largest
funds of the country, like Cam-
bridge’s. It is clear that a large
amount of money is immobi-
lised for little purpose.
I could go on dissecting the
financial statement for quite
some time. But the essential
message there is this: Imperial
doesn’t need most of the fees it
collects to pursue its essential
missions. I would love to hear
the viewpoint of the financial
department in this paper: they
can probably explain all of
their investment decisions as
sound. However, that is not
the issue. Instead, we must ask
ourselves: is the purpose of the
College to amass ever larger
assets? Is it normal that an in-
stitution whose stated mission
is “to achieve enduring excel-
lence in research and educa-
tion in science, engineering,
medicine and business for the
benefit of society” spends tens
of millions of pounds each
year buying property? Or
is the income, and especial-

ly that sourced from fees in-

to help educate students and
support research?
Our contributions are
geared towards increasingly
expensive real estate and fi-
nancial schemes, which may
look good for donors, but
are not as helpful to students
as, say, not starting your pro-
fessional life with two years’
rent worth of debt. The Union
should fight this, and each and
every one of us should raise
her or his voice.
