Where The Pancakes Are
felix visits a new home for pancakes
from around the world, Where the
Pancakes Are, and devours culinary
delights such as Dutch Babies, corn
fritters, and more.
baby gleamed back at me in
the form of a popover, similar
to a Yorkshire pudding, in the
size of my face. The edges
were puffed up in a glorious
golden brown, giving space
for the apple compote, fresh
berries and toasted almond
slices in the centre. I took
my knife and fork, cut a
rather large section, added
a dollop of that sweet cream
and stuffed it in my mouth
impatiently. Instantly I knew
there was no going back.
The batter transformed into
two distinct phases that
complimented one another:
the crispy, chewy edge and
the soft, fluffy insides that had
soaked up the sweet juices
from the berries and apples.
It was simple, and absolutely
E
venings on a
Wednesday for
me are often spent
alone in bed,
propped up by a
few lumpy pillows
and my loyal companion,
Netflix. The one that just
passed was no exemption,
with the addition of feeling
betrayed after a solid five
hours binge-watching the
last episodes of The Crown,
and left having to entertain
myself with my nose in the
BS 5500:1991 (which is,
in engineering lingo, the
specification for unfired fusion
welded pressure vessels),
looking for the definition of
some Factor C.
Taking a break from the
657 or so pages of ill-sized
Times New Roman that
had morphed into fuzzy
squiggles, I reached for my
dinner, an unappealing bowl
of romaine lettuce topped
with slices of avocado, olive
oil and seasoned with za’atar.
My stomach rumbled in dis-
appointment while my mind
drifted back to my breakfast
earlier that morning at Where
the Pancakes Are.
Yes. Where the Pancakes
Are. The name of the delight-
ful pancake house. She takes
up a quiet side in Flat Iron
Square, a newly opened
indie street food hub away
from the hustle and bustle of
the nearby Borough Market.
Walking in through the glass
doors, shutting out the biting
cold November winds, I was
greeted by a room saturated
with Scandinavian hygge.
The railway arch was cleverly
transformed into cosy space,
lit up by the warm, welcom-
ing light from the uniquely
shaped lightbulb filaments.
Small indoor plants adorned
the wooden tables and chairs,
creating a simple, homely
atmosphere.
This was actually my second
time visiting. The second time
in a week. Quite a dedication
for someone so absorbed in
the exciting events in SW7,
such as snoozing over morn-
ing lectures and fiddling with
flanges at hours past twilight.
And for a food blogger
who had once set a golden
rule that she never visits a
restaurant more than once,
this little place definitely held
a strong attraction for me to
visit again, much more than
queues outside The Breakfast
Club some 100 meters away.
The waitress gave a friendly
smile and handed me the
menu, along with a glass and
a carafe of water. It was a
simple list of pancakes, the
savoury, the sweet, and their
proud speciality, the Dutch
Baby. Following my stack
of wonderful, fluffy berries
pancake from my prior visit,
I went for the sweet Dutch
Baby without hesitation.
While waiting for the
moment of birth, I spotted the
owner, Patricia’s stylish, short,
blonde hair behind the coun-
ter. I introduced myself as the
blogger behind the photo
of her pancakes a few days
back, and invited her to share
her story over coffee.
Patricia lives a life
surrounded by all sorts
of pancakes. The large,
steaming Dutch pancakes
in the local pancake house
during her childhood in
Holland. Living off crepes on
the streets of Paris as a poor
student. The fluffy American
pancakes during her eight
various festivals, which she
humorously described as her
“military training”.
Her strong, determined,
gaze from her light blue eyes
was softened by a motherly
affection as she continued to
describe her dreams of creat-
ing a nutritious, wholesome
dining experience which this
ancient, universally loved
dish fuses with modern food
trends. In this room, pancakes
are not reserved for break-
fast, but also for lunch, dinner,
a full meal or a decadent
snack.
Her menu was not
comprised of your usual,
superficial, artery-clogging,
syrup-soaked stacks, but an
honest menu with high-quality,
local ingredients, inspiration
from different cultures, and
most importantly, generous
heaps of TLC. Behind it were
sprinkles of pancake-related
stories, happy memories serv-
ing waffles at school fairs and
love for her two children.
Midway through our con-
versation, my Dutch Baby
arrived on a hot, cast iron
skillet of a cradle with a pot
of cream, all on a wooden
tray. The beautiful, peaceful
Christy Lam
years in California as a film
producer, striving in the
then-booming independent
film industry of the 90’s. Now
her own inventions in her first
brick-and-mortar restaurant.
All after a gentle nudge
of courage, experimenta-
tion and her days serving
thousands of pancakes at
delicious. Of course it didn’t
last long.
My second visit was
definitely not the last. My
third visit was on a bright
Saturday afternoon, a mere
ten days later. This time I tried
something unexpected – the
Australian. This was not as
pancake-y as the rest, with it
being a stack of corn fritters,
with crushed avocado, crème
fraiche, preserved lemon and
a mixed leaf salad on top.
The fritters were hot with a
slightly crunchy edge, a good
kick of saltiness and a citrusy
hint from the lemon. The
whole combination was light
and satisfying. I was tempted
to encore the berries pancake
from my first visit – two thick,
fluffy buttermilk pancakes
with a sweet elderflower
and forest berry compote,
cream, crushed meringue and
roasted nuts.
That, was where the pan-
cakes were.
