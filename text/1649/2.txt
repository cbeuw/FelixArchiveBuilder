We’realmostthere
A
nother week, another quality paper.
The holidays are fast approaching,
and let me tell you I cannot wait. For a
glorious three weeks I will not have to
work like a madman and I can catch
up on all the Westworld I’ve missed,
and go through my inbox, print all my unread mail, put
it in little envelopes, mail it to myself, act all surprised
when I receive it, take it to the lounge in front of the
fireplace and chuck it in the blazing flames.
Speaking of emails, the department of Life Sciences
thought it was a good idea to remind everyone that
sexual assault is bad – thanks, I guess.
In other news, all the Jailbreak teams should be on
their way back by now. Some from the outskirts of
London, others from whatever their intercontinental
destinations were. They raised a lot of money which
was good. But some spent a lot of money too, which
was not so good. But, who am I to judge? The nicest
thing I’ve done all year is share some of my celery with
Jonathan Masters.
This week we tried to focus on disabilities. We wanted
to put the spotlight on the community but sadly we
didn’t manage to get the participation we were hoping
for. We still have some strong features and we want to
thank those of you who came forward and decided to
share your stories with us. Talking openly about our
experiences is the only way to really understand each
other and appreciate where everyone is coming from.
We hope these themes are taken as intended, as open
invitations to continuing contribution, not one-offs.
So, enjoy and be brave. Two more weeks till the
winter break.
