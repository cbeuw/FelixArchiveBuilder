Or , a strong argument for cooking
your own food. felix investigates the
what really goes on in many kitchens
and why some of the practices might
turn you away.

What’s really in your meal?
I
have to be honest with
you – chefs are doing
the job for one of two
reasons. Either they
absolutely love the food,
job and ethos or, they are
doing it as it’s the only option
available to them. Frankly,
the peanuts that you get paid
for working 14 hour shifts,
often for six days straight,
wouldn’t make any job worth
it for the money alone. At the
restaurant I worked at over
my holidays, which would be
considered fancy by some
and expensive by most, one
might assume that staff have
a better living. That is not
the case – we calculated my
co-workers wages at £3.35/
there for the food. Some
really are only doing it as it’s
the only option available to
them!
With that in mind, you have
to also accept that chefs who
want to work for the love and
joy of it will not necessarily
gravitate towards some of
the dining establishments you
might frequent on a regular
hr, if you took into account
his salary and lack of any
pay for overtime. I was not
nearly so lucky – I worked
for completely free – but I
had chosen to do so to build
my skillset and pursue my
career. I was being paid in
the knowledge and skills
that I learnt. But, I think it’s
imperative that you bear in
mind that chefs are not all
basis. You don’t expect the
love and attention to detail
that you might see in a fine
dining restaurant in your local
takeaway, so don’t expect the
same standards of care and
hygiene! It’s one of the rea-
sons that I shy away from so
many small, hipster eateries
with extremely trendy over-
hanging haircuts, amazingly
ring laden fingers and more
potential causes of anything
from an innocuous hair, to a
night of the shits. And those
are the smallest of issues
in large kitchens. You can
hardly begin to imagine the
problems that you don’t see.
Roaches in flour bags, frogs
in unwashed salad leaves, the
list goes on and on.
I’m not saying that high
end chefs are immune from
hygiene errors, but we cer-
tainly take a lot more care.
Things from basic food safety
certificates to having a head
chef scream at you for not
washing your hands thor-
oughly all give me much more
faith in similar restaurants.
So what can you do? The
simple answer is to do it
yourself! Cooking for yourself
doesn’t guarantee you an
escape from hairs in soup,
or as my girlfriend once
discovered a rogue fly that
flew into her salad. But it cer-
tainly means you won’t have
anyone to blame but yourself.
Better than GBK
Lets be real – none of us can afford
GBK anyhow. Fortunately, buying
burger patties and cooking them up
doesn’t get your hands too messy,
and the results are delicious, as felix
finds out.
I
must start this article
by giving credits to my
Anonymous Kitchen
Helpers: they are the
ones who remade the
puff-pastry last time, after
ruining it. It’s always great
having helping hands, even if
sometimes they can be more
of a hindrance.
But now I am not going to
Andrada Balmez
talk about my experiences
cooking – I want to talk about
my experiences eating out.
Not going to Nandos – by
eating out I mean just changing
kitchens in halls and not being
the head chef, but more like
an assistant. It happens even
to the best of us… but I am,
ultimately, a student so, when
food is offered to me, I cannot
simply say no. Right?
Some of my friends decided
to make burgers, and I decided
to trust them and have some
faith that I wouldn’t die. And
believe it or not, I had an
extremely delicious dinner –
with less effort than I would
normally invest in a dinner – all
I had to do was to fry some
meat. Easy peasy!
				
1. Find someone who is not
afraid to fry meat, especially
when all the oil starts spitting.
Make them feel like they have
to do it so everyone can sur-
vive the night and start them
on frying the burgers on a high
heat.
2.Make the sauce: mix the
ketchup, the mayo and the
Dijon mustard in a bowl; chop
the onion in small pieces and
add it in the mixture to taste –
you can leave it out entirely.
Chop the salad leaves into bite
sized mouthfuls, and mix with
the tomatoes Finish with the
lemon juice and mix a bit more.
3.When the burgers are close
to done, add the two slices of
cheese on top of each patty
and keep it in the pan for some
two extra minutes or until the
cheese is melted, but not for
too long – you don’t want
overcooked meat, right?
4.Build your burger. Add
some tomato slices and maybe
some extra salad or onion. Top
up with the sauce and add the
top slice of bun.
5. Enjoy!
Yes, number five is actually a
step: you definitely must relax
and forget about all the student
worries and enjoy an easy-to-
make and almost-healthy meal.
