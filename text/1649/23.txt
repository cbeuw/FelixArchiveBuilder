SEX
hows and whys and what-not-
to-dos pretty clear as you go.
There’s also the delicate
issue of attraction. Attracting
someone for sex becomes
more of a challenge, because
it means not only looking
for someone interested in
someone of your gender and
personality, but also someone
who doesn’t see the disability
as a problem, or (ugh) fetish-
ise it. It can be harder to pick
people up in a bar or club,
and someone with a disability
can quite often be ruled out
on dating websites because
there are so many other
people it would be easier to
date. And this is unfair.
Disabled people often have
to work extra hard to prove
themselves as sexual beings,
exaggerating their sexuality
and emphasising their sexual
identity, just to be given the
Disabled people are not sexless
their condition. This stigma
can come in many forms, but
one of its manifestations is in
an inability to view disabled
people as sexual beings.
In general, the sexual
desires of those with disabil-
ities tend to be overlooked
because they have so many
other things to worry about,
and because the sexuality of
those with disabilities is not
visible or portrayed in the
media. But this isn’t to say
that they don’t have the same
urges and needs as able-bod-
ied folks. And moreso, it
doesn’t mean that they aren’t
having great sex.
In the same way that we
make adjustments for other
things in our life, like leaving
time to commute to work, or
putting a towel down before
having sex when Aunt Flo
is in town, depending on
the nature of each person’s
L
ife is hard, and finding
our way through the
labyrinth of dating,
relationships, and sex
is one of the hardest
and most formidable
tasks we face as millennials.
One thing that’s usually a
given is that we all like sex
(unless you’re asexual, which
is totally okay, or you make
the choice not to have sex for
whatever reason (whether it’s
because it causes you pain
or mental turmoil, or because
you believe that it is an affront
to God), which is also totally
okay). But when it comes to
hunting for a potential mate
(or mates), we often have a
very narrow view of who fits
into our dating pool.
And I’m not talking about
dating someone out of
your league, or trying to
break that racial bias that
we so vehemently deny. I’m
referring to the desirability
of people with disabilities.
As well as the physical or
mental problems associated
with their disability, disabled
people also have to face
social complexities, one of
which is the stigmatisation of
disability, some changes may
need to be made. Sounds like
it could be a lot of work, but
really this doesn’t have to be
any more of a big deal than
remembering that Nancy isn’t
into butt-stuff.
I’ve known people to be put
off having sex with disabled
people because it can be
complicated, intimidating,
and can require forward
planning. Certainly for those
having sex with a person with
severe physical disabilities for
the first time, there can be a
lot of anxiety. But it needn’t
be something to worry
about – it’s not like anyone is
going to break like delicate
porcelain as soon as you
touch them (if they are likely
to, they’ll warn you), and their
priority is probably going to
be for you both to get off,
so they’ll probably make the
same level of consideration
as able-bodied people. It
can be immensely frustrating,
wanting to experience the
rawest of human desires with
someone, but being held back
by the way that you are per-
ceived. It can be hurtful to be
rejected for no reason other
than the inconvenience of a
minor physical obstacle.
As a society, we need
to break away from the
subconscious idea that phe-
nomenal sex is a privilege
of the able-bodied. The best
experiences often come from
breaking away from our
narrow view of who we are
attracted to, whether that
means being open to some-
one of a different gender,
race, or number of limbs.
We’re all struggling through
the existential angst of our
modern, soulless world, so
let’s bond over that and try
not to create additional barri-
ers to having the sensational
orgasms we all deserve.
Though we’re often led to believe that having a disability automatically leads to a sexless existence
