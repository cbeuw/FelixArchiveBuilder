The partying and fireworks
on a wet, rainy night in and
around the Maracanã Stadium
marked the grand finale of the
biggest sporting showpiece of
the year and brought a happy
ending to two weeks full of
sweat, grit, determination,
tension, sportsmanship, joy,
tears, more sportsmanship and
the very best that sport has to
offer. The joyous end to the Rio
2016 Olympic Games was just
as well, considering the numer-
ous issues and controversies in
the build-up, and even during
the Games, ranging from a
green diving pool and empty
seats to the Zika virus outbreak
and the filthy state of Guana-
bara Bay, its waters containing
“superbugs” and even dead
bodies, among a plethora of
other nasty things.
On the bright side, this Olym-
pics turned out to be a highly
successful one for Team GB.
With 67 medals won in total
(27 gold, 23 silver and 17
bronze), this was their highest
tally since 1908, surpassing
the tally of 65, set right here in
London four years ago. They
came in 2nd
place in the gold
medal standings by country, a
place and a single gold medal
above China, who were on
26 (which is a pretty remarka-
ble achievement, considering
one does not simply win more
medals than China in the Olym-
pics unless one is the US). There
was joy for Imperial in this as
well, with Imperial alumnus
Melanie Wilson competing in
the Games as well. Better yet,
she was part of the women’s
eight that won a silver medal
in rowing, coming from last
place at the halfway point to
beat Romania to the 1st
runner
up spot right at the death. Yay
for Imperial!
I do (not) apologise for seiz-
ing this opportunity to gloat
about an excellent Olympic
campaign it’s been for my
home country, Malaysia, as
well. Our Olympians man-
aged to secure five medals,
our best ever tally at a Summer
Games. We even managed to
win medals in a sport that isn’t
badminton for only the 2nd
time. Yes, five medals hardly
matches up to Team GB’s 67,
but for a country still waiting
for its 1st
Olympic gold medal
(which has come tantalisingly
close on a few occasions now
but still proves rather elusive),
A mere 17 days after the con-
clusion of the Olympics, Rio
de Janeiro would once again
play host to one of the sport-
ing world’s biggest events – the
Paralympic Games, where I will
make a point of congratulating
once again the success of Team
GB. Their 147 medals, 67 of
which were gold, put them
firmly in 2nd
place in the medals
200m event in athletics. Once
again, I unapologetically use
this chance to gloat about
Malaysia’s achievements at
the Paralympics. It was, like
the Olympics before it, also
Malaysia’s best ever showing
at the Paralympics – this was
the first time we managed to
win a Paralympic gold medal,
and we won three of them (and
a bronze medal as well). Need-
less to say, our Paralympians
(and Olympians, of course)
received a hero’s welcome
upon their return from Brazil.
Given the hype of London
2012 and the majesty of one
of this year’s most important
sporting events in the world,
you would expect the Paralym-
pics to be met with just as much
excitement and enthusiasm as
the Olympics before it. Given
it was held in the same place
as the able-bodied Olympics
and that ticket sales were
high, you’d think that was the
case. With over two million
tickets sold, you’d be forgiven
for suggesting that the Rio
Paralympics would surpass
Beijing 2008 as the 2nd
most
attended Paralympics Games
Managing to sell so many
tickets is indicative of success,
yet a dismal 12% of ticket
sales not too long before the
Games, supposedly due to a
lack of interest from the locals
and sponsors, left a lot to be
desired and resulted in signif-
icant budget shortfalls. The
organisers were also unable
to pay travel grants of up to
$8 million to participating
nations. Sir Philip Craven MBE,
president of the International
Paralympic Committee, cer-
tainly had grim words to say
about it: “Never before in the
56-year history of the Paralym-
pic Games have we faced
circumstances like this.”
Only after cuts had been
announced, and drastic meas-
ures taken, that ticket sales
began to take a turn for the
better. Launched by former
London 2012 marketing direc-
tor Greg Nugent, backed by
rock band Coldplay and even
receiving a personal donation
from Prince Harry, the #FillThe-
Seats campaign took off. A
crowdfunded initiative to buy
tickets for Brazilian children
to watch the Paralympics, it
was of no small help in doing
exactly what its name suggests.

in history.
But what went wrong?
Ticket sales soared and eventu-
ally, the final figures were able
to paper over the cracks that
were initially present. Again,
it seems another case of ‘all’s
well that ends well’. But this
must never happen again.
London 2012, the most suc-
cessful Paralympic Games ever
in terms of ticket sales, with 2.7
million sold, set the benchmark
for disabled sport and show-
cased Britain’s diverse nature.
It left a legacy for disabled
sport and took it to a new high.
Paralympic wheelchair racer
Anne Wafula Strike gave an
Interview to The Guardian,
saying:
“We should be proud of
what we achieved in London
in 2012, when people started
to look at us as fully fledged
athletes. The world has a lot to
learn from 2012, they should
ask for the notes. Sport is the
only language everyone can
speak. Whether you are tall
and a superstar like Usain
Bolt, or whether you are racing
in a wheelchair, everyone
understands.”
It’s a shame that the
immediate successor to the
very Games that raised
the benchmark and set the
“gold-standard” of disabled
sport came so dangerously
close to throwing away the
legacy its predecessor stood
for. They’ve had seven years
to plan and budget for this,
but perhaps the strain of host-
ing a succession of big events:
the United Nations Conference
on Sustainable Development
in 2012, a Papal visit in 2013,
the FIFA World Cup two years
ago and now these Games,
coupled with the country’s eco-
nomic condition. Needless to
say, it has all taken its toll.
More obscure but no less sig-
nificant, the Paralympic Games
are as much a celebration of
sport as the Olympics are. It’s
a statement of empowerment
to all the disabled persons out
there that even with a disabil-
ity, you can still participate
in sport. You can still dream
of and achieve something
big. And most of all, you can
inspire, motivate and empower
others like you to do the same.
Just because you can’t see, are
unable to move around without
a wheelchair or suffer from an
intellectual disability, doesn’t
mean you’re anything less
than an extraordinary human
being. This certainly applies to
sport as well, and practicing it
is something everyone has a
right to. In fact, that’s one of
the fundamental principles of
Olympism:
“The practice of sport is a
human right. Every individual
must have the possibility of
practising sport, without dis-
crimination of any kind and
in the Olympic spirit, which
requires mutual understand-
ing with a spirit of friendship,
solidarity and fair play.”
The legalisation of same-sex
marriage in the US last year
represents a major victory
for the LGBT community. They
are human beings and have
as much of a right to do just
about everything a hetero-
sexual person can. If we as a
society can acknowledge and
accept the LGBT community as
equals and for who they are,
then we can do the same for
the disabled. Having a disabil-
ity is always going to create
challenges, and just because
able-bodied people aren’t in
the same boat doesn’t mean
we should see them as inferior.
Again, a disability is nothing
to be ashamed of, and having
one of any sort does not make
one any less ‘human’ in any
way.
And it is due to these rea-
sons that the Paralympics must
never be seen as less impor-
tant or worse still, cast aside in
favour of its able-bodied coun-
terpart. That would be a mass
act of discrimination against all
the Paralympians and disabled
athletes out there, robbing
them of the chance to realise
their dreams and essentially
sending a message to the
world that disabled people
matter less. It would not only
represent a huge step back for
disabled people, but one for
the entire human race as well.
The Paralympics in Rio, sup-
posedly a step forward from
the success of London, very
nearly turned into a step back.
Thankfully that didn’t happen
and hopefully it’ll be a more
positive story four years from
now in Tokyo.
