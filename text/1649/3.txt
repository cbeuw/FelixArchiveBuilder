A
packed public
meeting was
attended by
hundreds of
Hammersmith
and Fulham
residents this week, in support
of the campaign to save
Charing Cross Hospital.
“There is nothing that
makes me prouder to be
British than those three words:
National Health Service”.
This was the rallying call sent
out by Cllr Stephen Cowan at
the close of the meeting after
defending his refusal to sign
the North West London Sus-
tainability and Transformation
Plan. Cowan, the Leader
Public meeting to save Charing Cross
A packed crowd criticised changes to A&E services
Stephen Naulls
of the Council asked the
audience what type of world
we want to hand on to our
children, following a scathing
criticism of the government’s
plans to radically overhaul
healthcare in the borough as
part of an extensive cost-cut-
ting programme touted to be
worth in excess of £1.3bn.
Roger Steer, a member
of the team involved in the
critical appraisal of the STP,
voiced concerns over the
viability of the plan, which
would see a reduction of
in-patient capacity by 600
beds in a time when the pop-
ulation of North West London
is projected to increase by
26% over the next 20 years.
There was also a criticism of
Imperial College Healthcare
Trust’s statement claiming
“there will be no reduction in
the hospital’s A&E and wider
services during the lifetime of
the STP” as spin, given that
the duration of the plan is
only five years; hardly provid-
ing lasting protection for the
status of the hospital. Indeed,
for a plan which claims to be
sustainable and transform-
ative, there is little evidence
of any consideration of the
long-term ramifications of the
reforms.
There was further elucida-
tion of the exact changes that
would be made to Charing
Cross’ A&E services. Since
Hammersmith and Central
Middlesex A&Es were closed,
other A&Es in London have
struggled to meet the national
waiting time requirements
due to increased pressure on
services. Again, Cllr Cowan
outlined the calculated use of
A&E classification to deceive
the public on the fate of the
services. Currently, CX has
a ‘Class 1’ categorisation,
which NHS England defines
as a “consultant led 24-hour
service with full resuscitation
facilities and designated
accommodation for the
reception of accident and
emergency patients”. The
plans would see CX down-
graded to a ‘Class 3’ A&E
which is “nurse led and treats
minor injuries”. As the panel
jested – if your child got their
head stuck in a bucket, you’d
take them to a Class 3 A&E
to get some Vaseline to help
slide it off. More seriously
though, this draws to atten-
tion the clear deception of
the public on the true extent
of the changes; in a world
increasingly consumed by a
post-truth politics, politicians
appear more concerned with
masking the truth from us than
engaging in a real debate
about the future of our health
service.
Also under threat would be
Charing Cross’ world-class
stroke services, which would
potentially be relocated to St
Mary’s in an effort to create
a ‘superhub’ capable of com-
peting on the international
stage. For campaigners from
Save Our Hospitals on the
panel, however, providing
rapid and safe treatment
for Londoners takes priority.
The shift in location would
see two stroke centres based
within one mile of each other,
potentially leaving NW
London dangerously isolated.
The government’s pledge
that they could transport
somebody from Chiswick
to Paddington in under 14
minutes was laughed off by
the audience. But beneath the
laughter remains the much
darker truth that the extent
of the centralisation present
in the plan could put patients
in danger, especially if the
population projections are
accurate and acute demand
in NW London continues to
grow.
There was a chance
for ICSM students to ask
questions too. A member of
BMA Imperial’s contingent
quizzed the panel on the
consequences for undergrad-
uate medical training. With
closures resulting fewer hospi-
tals to train in, students voiced
concerns that there would be
fewer learning opportunities
due to saturation of their
clinical placements with more
students per consultant and
the impact of this on their
ongoing training.
Whether this outcry from
both local residents and stu-
dents at the plans will change
the future of Charing Cross
remains to be seen.
