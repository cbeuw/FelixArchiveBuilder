ractals are
everywhere we look.
Clouds, snowflakes,
broccoli - even
mountains are full
of them. Simply put,
a fractal is a never-ending
pattern that can be defined
as ‘a rough or fragmented
geometric shape that can be
subdivided in parts, each of
which is a reduced-size copy
of the whole’. This property of
fractals is called self-similarity.
In nature, fractals mainly
include branching patterns
like those of a tree or river
tributaries, or spiral patterns
like a hurricane or the Milky
Way.
Despite being evident
in all living things, they
why their compositions hold
so much interest.
But the world of fractal
mathematics not only inspired
artists. By showing the hidden
beauty found beneath reality,
studying them has also aided
researchers in cosmology,
medicine, engineering and
genetics as well. Using frac-
tals is a great way to describe
the unpredictable, like earth-
quakes, variation in heart
rhythm and the outbreak of
disease to name but a few
applications.
predominantly feature in
the study of maths, as they
were first named by Benoit
Mandelbrot (1924-2010) –
‘the fractalist’ – who is the
father of fractal geometry
and invented the term in
1975. Mathematical fractals,
such as ‘the Mandelbrot
Set’ are simply formed by
repeating the same equation
thousands of times and
looping the answer into the
start. This forms an infinitely
complex pattern, which can
form beautiful pictures when
viewed graphically. For this
reason, fractals are often
used in fashion as well as
creative arts with one famous
example being paintings by
Katsushika Hokusai. Even
the work of famous classical
musicians has underlying
fractal algorithms to explain

ollowing the general
vibes of this tragic
excuse of a year,
scientists have now
confirmed that 2016
has seen the largest
coral die-off ever recorded on
Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.
The most affected area
runs along the northern part,
where an average of 67%
of all shallow-water coral
has been lost in the past 8-9
months.
The worst part is that the
north side of the reef was the
most pristine and protected
section of this natural marvel.
The well-known marine
research station, Lizard
Island, is directlywhere most
of the die-off has occurred.
Earlier this year, I asked a
friend of mine how to get
involved with the research
they were doing and she just
replied “I wouldn’t recom-
mend it right now, the coral
is bleached to heck and
everyone working there is a
bit sad at the moment”. I now
rising temperatures. For now,
these parts are safe, but it
would take at least 10-15
years before the northern
area of the reef regains its
coral. However, there is a
risk of a fourth bleaching
event this coming summer that
could damage the already
broken reef beyond repair.
An even more terrifying
prediction has also been put
forward by Drew Harvell, a
renowned professor in ecol-
ogy biology who specialises
in marine diseases. She says
that after mass bleaching
events, outbreaks of coral
disease often follow as “the
double whammy of corals
being stressed and warm
temperatures favour infectious
micro-organisms”.
The take away message
from this story, is if you’ve
ever fancied visiting this
natural wonder, do it sooner
rather than later. With these
climate predictions, it won’t
be so ‘Great’ in a few years’
time.
understand why.
Further south, scientists
were very much relieved to
see lower levels of death and
destruction. Professor Andrew
Baird led teams of divers to
re-survey the reefs in October
and November, and has
confirmed that on average 6%
of bleached corals died in the
central region, and only 1%
in the south this year. These
corals have bounced back
post-bleaching and regained
their vibrant colour. This is
welcome news after the major-
ity of them bleached over
summer, and there were fears
many were too far gone.
The reason for this partial
protection of the reef may
be to do with the upwelling
of cold water from the Coral
Sea reducing heat stress from

Ben Sharpless discusses the latest controversy surrounding the new £5 note
A
n ever growing
body of
evidence is
suggesting that
depression,
and other
forms of mental illness, can be
linked with physical conditions
like bowel and skin diseases.
While it’s clear that mental
disorders are associated
with a higher incidence of
physical conditions, how
generalized (over a range
of physical health outcomes)
these associations are is far
less clear.
A recent study by psycholo-
gists at the University of Basel
and Ruhr University Bochum
has identified temporal pat-
terns in the mental and physical
state of 6,500 young people.
In particular, the study links
arthritis and digestive system
diseases with depression,
anxiety with skin disease
and others like epilepsy with
eating disorders. Previously,
evidence linking physical and
mental disease was largely on
a single-case basis, but for the
first time it has been formally
noted that the two are corre-
lated, with physical diseases
occurring more frequently in
adolescents having previously
suffered a mental illness. Inter-
estingly, the same might be said
about mental disorders occur-
ring after the onset of particular
physical diseases. Diseases
relating to moods, feelings
or attitudes like depression
often saw the development of
arthritis or digestive diseases,
while anxiety disorders were
more common with people
with a history of heart disease.
Another study looked at
the association of 16 specific
mental disorders with the
subsequent onset or diagnosis
of 10 chronic physical condi-
tions. The cases were spread
across 17 countries, with the
main outcome of the study
being that all kinds of mental
disorders were associated, at
least in part, with a significant
risk of developing one of a
wide range of chronic physical
conditions. The authors suggest
that current efforts to improve
the physical health of individ-
uals might be too narrowly
focused on a small group of
the most severe mental disor-
ders, while it might be more
optimal to consider integrating
physical health considerations
into the treatment of all mental
disorders, as early as possible.
These studies offer insight
into the causal relationship
between physical and mental
disease, throwing light on the
processes that are relevant
to their origins and perhaps
how to better treat them indi-
vidually, or even together. The
results of these studies, and
others, are likely to cause many
to doubt the effectiveness of
what can only be described
as the appalling treatments
that exist for many serious
mental diseases. Arguably,
we’re not advanced in the
areas of physical science,
philosophy or psychology to
fully explain the interaction
between physical and mental
disease, or how to properly
cure them. That said, now
that the relationship between
them is better established,
we might better anticipate
mental or physical disease
in all their forms. The origins
of one might well stimulate
the onset of the other, and
perhaps more study into the
nature of this relationship will
lead to better treatment, and
ultimately prevention of the
crippling and cyclic nature of
mental and physical disease.

ntroduced in September
of this year, the revamped
£5 bank notes are
designed to be more
robust and last longer
than the previous edition.
Already seen in countries
like Australia, Canada and
Indonesia, these polymer
bank notes are designed
not to be torn, therefore
increasing their lifespan by
about 2.5 times, reducing the
need to produce more.
Though unlike these
banknotes, the UK’s £5 note
contains one surprising ingre-
dient – tallow.
Tallow is a processed form
of rendered beef fat obtained
from cows, and is probably
best known as once being
used in candles as the main
form of light in pre-electrical
times. More recently, it is
found in soap, the production
of biofuels, and food produc-
tion, such as deep-fryed fast
food.
The Bank of England has
declined to comment on any
further details about the use
of animal fat in its banknotes,
without giving a reason or a
possible alternative, but the
news has left many people
angered and triggered a
large online petition to have
the banknotes removed
or replaced. While most
of the time vegans – and
other consumers – have a
choice to consume animal or
non-animal goods, there is
little choice when it comes to
which currency you use. The
use of animal fats also impli-
cates religious groups such
as some Hindu, Sikh and Jain
groups, who are forbidden
to use beef products, in line
with their faith.
Protesters argue its use as
unethical and needless, citing
the lack of animal fats in
polymer banknotes of other
countries, and the petition
against the use of tallow in
£5 banknotes has reached
100,000 signatures at the
time of writing.
F
act: A 10-year old
girl discovered a
new molecule in her
chemistry lesson.
Anyone who did
chemistry at school
will remember those ball-
and-stick molecule toys that
teachers used to try and
get everyone enthusiastic
about covalent bonding.
But 10 year old Clara
Lazen decided she knew
more than her teacher.
Clara managed to
arrange black, red and
green balls (represent-
ing carbon, oxygen and
nitrogen) into a compli-
cated arrangement that
looks like the result of a
bet on who could make
the most excessive mole-
cule before someone got
shouted at. And yet, when
she asked her teacher if it
was real, he wasn’t sure.
Turned out she had discov-
ered tetranitratoxycarbon
– a molecule that doesn’t
exist in nature, but could
theoretically be made in
a lab. Cue the youngest
author of a paper in Com-
putation and Theoretical
Chemistry and everlast-
ing jokes about being the
teacher’s pet. While the
molecule hasn’t actually
been made yet, in theory
it could be used to store
energy or as an explo-
sive similar to dynamite.
Funnily enough, now she’s
more interested in biology
and medicine. Chemis-
try? Completed it mate.

Another important use is in
the financial market, where
Mandelbrot first started
working on the mathematics
of complexity at IBM during
the 60s. He even wrote a
book on his theories, where
he applies fractals to describe
the future of the stock market.
Overall, fractals not

also describe the world by
