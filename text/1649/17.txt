intriguing look at the widely
acknowledged problem to
student finance and how far
people have to go to pay it
off. So, does this TV drama do
justice to it’s weighty topic?
T
his was an unusual
show for a number
of reasons. The
show starts off
fairly simple but
slowly evolves into
an intriguing drama with
complexity and depth.
The series features Riley
Keough as law student Chris-
tine Reade, who makes a
decision to become an escort
right about the same time
she starts an internship at a
law firm. Money is obviously
the primary factor, but for
Christine specifically, it’s also
about power. The first few
episodes of the series revolve
around her managing multi-
ple roles together and making
everything work.
The show really starts to get
going after all the setup has
taken place. You may expect
that a standard story where
the character realises the
error of their ways and leaves
the profession; however, in
this case, the show subverts
the tropes. For Christine,
things don’t go quite as
smoothly as she’d like and
everything begins to slip.
One of her clients starts to
get obsessively attached, and
Christine sleeps with her boss
only to find out he’s involved
in shady dealings. It starts to
become harder and harder
for her to keep the different
parts of her lives separate
from each other. The later half
of the show revolves around
Christine losing control and
trying desperately to get it
back, leading to an engaging
and riveting spectacle.
The aesthetics of the show
are impressive, if not bleak
and colourless. We’re treated
to a landscape environment
consisting of large windows,
expensive hotel rooms, and
fancy restaurants, none too
colourful and all full of class.
Given that the main players
of the show are rich business
people and lawyers, it’s a
perspective that makes sense.
There’s even a brief indication
of how small the high life
environment is when Christine
accidentally runs into her
boss while seeing a client.
The choreography is well
done and works in con-
junction with the sound to
really produce an interesting
viewing experience. It all
comes together to really feel
the impact of the scene and
the intensity of what the char-
acters are experiencing. For
example, in one scene, when
a character is jogging but
constantly looking back, the
viewer is made to feel uneasy
and worried with them.
Another great scene occurred
towards the end when Chris-
tine is masturbating alone but
unable to get off, symbolising
how all her choices up to that
point have led her to get all
the money and control she
could want, but ultimately,
with no satisfaction.
This is a show where the
main character is an escort,
so as you might imagine,
there are a number of explicit
scenes. To be frank, they
are the least interesting
parts of the show, sometimes
deterring from the bigger
story. If you’re looking for
soft erotica, you’re going to
be disappointed. Personally,
the only reason they were
interesting was to see how
they contribute to the bigger
picture.
The characters are a stimu-
lating bunch, in that you don’t
really care for or relate to
any of them, even Christine.

some of them are downright
ruthless at times. This is in
line with the kind of people
and environment that’s being
depicted, especially with the
emphasis on the not-so-great
parts of people. Emotions,
or having some sort of emo-
tional attachment, is depicted
to us as a negative trait,
where you need to be distant
to move forward in such an
atmosphere. That’s not to
say so the acting is boring,
all the actors are incredibly
on point, giving out certain
subtleties that show you that
there’s more than meets the
eye with them.
Riley Keough is the literal
and figurative star of the
show, giving an amazing
performance as Christine.
She’s able to play a number
of different personas, from
Christine’s usual stoic expres-
sionless self to her happy and
playful escort persona. Some-
times you genuinely believe
Christine cares only to realise
it was all a charade. You see
her keep what little emotions
she has in check, while con-
stantly striving to gain control
and to be taken seriously. As
things start to fall apart, you
also see her become more
paranoid and start lashing
out at everyone.
This show does hard but
intriguingly interesting work,
giving us a frank look at a
very real thing. It refuses
to judge Christine and so
challenges you to judge its
central theme. It might show
a very cynical outlook, that
relationships are just inher-
ently transactions, but it does
it well.
