The success of the
#saveourculture campaign
has led to the reopening of
fabric, but has an opportunity
been missed to rationalise the
approachtodrug-relatedharm
in clubs?
L
ast week it was
announced that fabric
would be reopening
“soon”, along with
an extensive new
licensing agreement.
Particularly salient for
students in London is the new
block on under 19s from
entering on club nights and
the lifetime bans for those
found with drugs on them
or attempting to purchase
drugs within the club. The
recent saga of closure,
#saveourculture campaign,
and reopening was triggered
by the deaths of two 18-year-
olds (in separate incidents) at
the club over the summer. In
light of this, while I’m ecstatic
that one of London’s top
dance venues is reopening
its doors, I can’t help but feel
that both the club and the
council missed an opportunity
to champion a more logical
approach to club drug use.
Clearly everyone has agreed
that stopping deaths at the
club is the priority, but how
much are the new measures
really going to help?
The club is already infamous
for its thorough search pro-
cedures on entry: many times
I have experienced rather
more intimate touching than I
would like without having had
a drink bought for me. In fact,
fabric has been commended
by a district judge on its
industry-leading approach to
drug searches and security.
However, updated measures
include increased CCTV
surveillance and “Search
Captains”, which apart
from allowing clubbers to
empathise with victims of the
Stasi, I doubt will have any
impact on drug abuse at the
club. Tighter prohibition will
merely drive drug use further
under the radar. Facing a
lifetime ban if caught at the
door, surely clubbers will
just ingest the currently fash-
ionable upper before they
reach the end of the queue.
If anything, this is more likely
to make them overdose - think
how many friends haven’t
managed to make it out after
pre-drinks. Kicking young,
insensible drug users out of
clubs and onto the streets
or into warehouses will only
lead to more harm. Inside
a club, they can at least be
monitored by staff and cared
for until help arrives.
Drug charity The Loop
provides drug testing and
welfare at music events, and
was extensively involved in
the licensing review process.
In 2013, its director Professor
Fiona Measham provided
lower doses than MDMA.
This strategy would have a
two-pronged effect on club
drugs, forcing shady dealers
to increase the purity and
quality of their drugs, further
leading to less chance of
accidental overdose.
Police, clubbers, and venues
have the same objective:
reducing harm from drug
use. It’s time for a logical,
health-centred approach
to this aim. Prohibition has
failed to stop deaths and
will continue to fail. The
1994 Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act was cre-
ated to close down illegal,
underground raves and
music events. This led to
the establishment of venues
like fabric, which present a
safer environment for lovers
of dance music to let loose.
The increasingly oppressive
response to drug use will only
lead to the return of illegal,
unlicensed events, which lack
the staff or facilities to help
clubbers that go too far.
Opponents of anonymous
drug testing assert that it
encourages use of danger-
ous illegal drugs, but let’s be
honest and ask ourselves how
well the current approach is
working to prevent it. Findings
by the Crime Survey of Eng-
land and Wales showed that
in 2015, ecstasy use by young
adults had increased by 84%
since the year before. A more
pragmatic and compassion-
ate approach to drug use is

Project in Manchester, one

events in the UK. Tests are
done to determine the purity

used more widely, the results
could be posted in real time,
alerting clubbers to particu-

batches of pills. A common

Drug testing would provide
useful information to users
about the risks associated
with the drugs they’re taking.
It’s hard not to compare drug
prohibition with the failure of
abstinence based approaches
to pre-marital sex. It’s time to
quit the puritanical crusade
against drug use and start
safeguarding drug users,
otherwise we’ll keep losing
young lives to dodgy pills.
