Great
Expectations |
A worthy
adaptation
T
he advice of Mr
Jaggers is "Take
nothing on its looks;
take everything on
evidence. There’s
no better rule." It is
keenly observed by Christian
Burgess who delivers a no
frills production of Great
Expectations superbly carried
by convincing performances
and slick directing.
Great Expectations is Dick-
en’s penultimate novel and
perhaps his most assured; by
1860 Dickens had acquired
considerable life experience
– he had separated from his
wife Catherine Dickens, and
was concealing a surrepti-
tious affair with the much
younger Ellen Ternan – this is
channelled into the capricious
affairs of young Pip along his
journey toward adulthood.
Many of the novel’s themes
reflect the Victorian Britain in
which it is set: social injustice,
poverty, a gothic depiction
of the waning aristocracy.
Others are timeless charac-
teristics of the bildungsroman:
unrequited love, disen-
franchised youth, pride,
ignorance, and catharsis.
Burgess tactfully navigates
these themes to give a bal-
anced performance. For those
who know the novel well,
there is admirable continuity.
The dialogue is lifted directly
from the text and the sparse
set design leaves the imagina-
tion to conjure up the story’s
many vivid settings,
firmly ingrained in our
subconscious from
the descriptions in
the book. A gen-
eral atmosphere
of foreboding is
maintained by
Andy Taylor’s
droning orches-
tral score and
the troop of
actors who,
when not per-
forming, stand
automaton-like
on stage, mirroring
Pip’s reactions to the
unfolding drama.
This quirk is used
effectively to narrate the
play; the same actors deliver
Pip’s inner monologue as we
move from scene to scene.
This gives an impetus to the
plot and paces the perfor-
mance excellently, the entire
performance is no more than
two hours yet covers most of
the intricacies in the novel.

One disappointing omission
are the scenes at Wemmick’s
castle, and the development
of Wemmick’s eccentricity is
largely neglected throughout
the play, but given the con-
straints of time this is justified.
During the performance,
once again, I was reminded
of why Guildhall is considered
a world leading conserva-
toire. The calibre of talent
was very high: Luke Thallon’s
portrayal of Mr. Jagger was

superbly imperious and
undemonstrative. It is rare
that after reading a novel,
our perception of a character
is improved by another’s
interpretation: this was a first
for me, and I look forward
to seeing how the career of
this young actor progresses.
Also notable were Rupert
Henderson and Amelia
Strohm, who played Pip and
Estella respectively. In many
ways the complexities of the
plot hang on the relationship
between these two charac-
ters, and the actors bore the
weight of this burden admira-
bly. Pip’s transformation from
a blacksmith’s apprentice to
a besotted gentleman was
achieved seamlessly, his
performance confident and
funny throughout. Estella was
played with a solemnity and
nobleness that reminded me
of the woman with ‘beauty
like a drawn bow’ that Yeats
describes in No Second Troy.
Their relationship was con-
vincing, tragic and provided
a firm foundation for the rest
of the actors to work from.
When Dickens first con-
ceived the plot of Great
Expectations, he called
it ‘a very fine, new and
grotesque idea’. The more I
review shows, I am starting
to recognise that successful
dramas share aspects in
common. Great Expecta-
tions may be grotesque,
and it certainly is fine, but
it is not entirely new; the
fundamental principles
upon which good plot,
character and story
are based on never
change. According
to E.M Forster:
“The final test of a
novel will be our
affection for it, as it
is of anything which
we cannot define.”
The care put into
a performance like
this demonstrates why
Great Expectations
deserves its reputation
as a classic.

D
espite the
pre-existing
Manon by
Jules Massenet,
Puccini chose to
write another
opera based on the story of
Manon Lescaut, defending
his decision thus: “a woman
like Manon can have
more than one lover.” The
sentiment is not untrue; by
turns passionate, coquettish,
and mercenary, Manon is
a character who captivates
both the audience and her
fellow protagonists on stage.
Manon begins the opera
as an unsuspecting ingénue
of striking beauty. In keeping
with the long tradition of
badly treating women like
her, she is desired, and
exploited. Her father sends
her to a convent; her brother
happily sells her off to the old
lecher Geronte. Geronte, on
his part, tries to abduct her
by force but she escapes with
Des Grieux, the student she
has just met and fallen in love
with.
Unlike most other naïve her-
oines, however, Manon is not
just a helpless character at the
mercy of circumstance. She
wants to have it all, though
this eventually leads to her
undoing. Act II finds her the
lavishly kept mistress of Ger-
onte rather than the devoted
wife of Des Grieux. When
Des Grieux comes to find her,
Manon wants to flee with him,
but cannot quite tear herself
away from her jewels, lead-
ing to their fatal delay and
arrest. She is deported
with other prostitutes
(the devoted Des
Grieux follows her)
and dies of thirst
“in the Louisiana
desert”.
Modernised
productions seem
to be in fashion
this season: direc-
tor Kasper Holten’s
Manon Lescaut is set
two centuries forward
in contemporary Paris.
Having watched the modern
productions of Cymbeline
(delightful) and Oreste (ter-
rible), I’m not actually sure
where Manon Lescaut falls on
the spectrum. The sets were
individually stunning – a crys-
tal cage with garishly pink
trimmings for Act II, a bro-
ken-off highway to nowhere
for the final scenes – but

didn’t really come together
to tell a coherent story. Act II,
set in Manon’s boudoir, was
surprisingly risqué though it

of a modern setting? If the
plot works better in its original
historical period, importing it
to the modern era feels more
gimmicky than constructive.
It is a bit hard, for example,
to imagine anyone being sent
to a convent or deported for
being a courtesan in this day
and age.
Nevertheless – the essence
of an opera should remain in
its music. Puccini’s score for
Manon Lescaut is beautifully
lush and symphonic. It was
thought to be his response to
the German operatic giant
Wagner; as a great fan of
Wagner, perhaps that is
why I found it particularly
enjoyable. Antonio Pappano
is an experienced conduc-
tor of Puccini at the Royal
Opera House, and he did
not disappoint. As Manon,
soprano Sondra Radvanovsky
managed to bring out the
complexity of the character,
with her voice alternating to
evoke both the lighthearted
coquette and the desolate
fallen woman. Tenor Aleksan-
drs Antonenko also made
for an emotionally raw
Des Grieux, though his
voice perhaps did not
quite match up to the
powerful orchestra.
A very good per-
formance all round,
and worth going to,
even if the produc-
tion does leave a
few open questions
at the end.
