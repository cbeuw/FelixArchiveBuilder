standings, Imperial’s first team
currently place 4th
out of the
17 colleges, nail-bitingly close
behind UCL.
Alas, after a truck-load
of cake and biscuits were
consumed, the team headed
home and settled into a
well-earned rest/pre-drank
for Sports Night/resumed
impending coursework
(certainly not in that order).
Look out for the next LCL
report which takes ICXCAC
to Alexandra Palace; royal

hinking of
Wimbledon, visions
of grassy courts,
world-ranking
tennis pros, and
Sue Barker should
come to mind. So when we
told our runners that the next
race would be in Wimbledon,
there was a predictable
wave of excitement. Those
who were savvy enough to
deduce we weren’t tennis
players, or that it wasn’t July,
may have known there may
not be green grass involved,
but rather hills, cross country
trails, and grass of a browner
shade. Mud – I’m talking
about mud.
This is precisely what
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics
(ICXCAC) faced last
Wednesday when they
rocked up to Wimbledon
Common. This course is
the third and final London
College League (LCL) of
term and usually brings
about a Marmite argument.
Some hate it for being long,
undulating and bramble-
ridden, while others love it for
being long, undulating and
bramble-ridden. Whatever
side we took, Imperials’ 30-
plus runners took off into the
dwindling sunlight with steely
determination.
The course loop was 4.7 km
where women ran one loop,
and men ran two. Notable
features included a bottleneck
corner 30 metres in (causing
problems for those at the
back), a giant log to hurdle
over (great for athletics
training), and an uphill slalom
rich with brambles (as fun as
it sounds).
Imperial women completed
their race first, with Katie
Olding, Ellie Johnstone
and Charlotte Vanlancker
leading us in. Imperial
men, meanwhile, had
Harry Scriven, Will Jones
and Greg Jones taking the
top three spots. Notable
congratulations go to Katie
and Greg for currently
ranking 5th
and 9th
in the
individual women’s/men’s
results table for LCLs. Keep
it up guys! With team

O
n the 19th
and 20th
of
November, I
participated
in the
Women’s
Eastern Regionals for Ultimate
Frisbee. While I could just
list the outcomes of matches,
I think it’s time the sports
section of felix discussed what
goes the behind the scenes
of an ultimate tournament –
particularly from the lens of
an inexperienced player.
As a part of Imperial’s
second team, dD2, I didn’t
really have the pressure of
winning on my shoulders.
dD2’s main goal was to
improve and learn how to
play as a team. Although we
did not place so well (19th
of
21 teams), we were proud
of our improvement and
growth over the tournament
weekend. While we lost all
our games on the first day,
dD2 managed to tie and win
games on the second day.
Since Imperial’s first team
(dD1) and dD2 didn’t play
at the same time, dD2 spent
much of our breaks admiring
dD1. I think it came to a point
where dD2 kept saying,
“did you see that throw,”
or “they’re so good”. And
to be honest, dD1 is good.
I don’t think the outcome of
Women’s Regionals reflects
the skills of our women’s first
team. They throw the disc
with some pretty impressive
physics, leaving me to admire
to ability to throw discs with
such grace.
dD1 finished 6th
overall,
barely missing the top four
qualifying spots for Nationals
after losing to UEA and
Sussex in their games-to-go.
Watching dD1’s last games
pulled on my heartstrings;
while dD1 played clinically,
they had a major height
disadvantage. This resulted
in Sussex and UEA chucking
discs into the scoring zone
and ultimately winning the
tie-break points.
Although there was some
disappointment with the final
results, we played some fun
ultimate and had a great
tournament. Also, dD1 beat
their long-term rival team,
Cambridge so what more
could we ask for?

to close out the game with
interceptions from Henry
‘Old Man’ Alston, Panujum
Taleongpony and the ever-
present Jason. Special
mention to big man Panujum
for being stopped on the
two-yard line following a
stampeding run down the
field. The Immortals closed
out the game confidently with
the final score being 42-6.
Following this win, the
Immortals now lie in the
playoff positions for the first
time since the 2014 season,
when they reached the
national semi-finals. They will
be looking to take another
step towards replicating their
previous playoff success in
two weeks against a UEA
team, keen for retribution.
F
ollowing a strong
win and a defensive
shut out against
the UEA Pirates,
the Immortals were
looking to build
upon their momentum and
announce themselves as
serious playoff contenders.
Standing in their way were
the Immortals’ fierce rivals,
Royal Holloway.
The Immortals received the
ball to start, with Markus
‘Donald Plump’ Mohr
catching the deep ball
and returning it 20 yards.
Likely the first ever kick
return from an O-Linemen
in BUCS history. A strong
offensive drive ensued,
but came to an abrupt halt
when Quarterback Jason
‘Poundcut’ Kuilan threw an
interception under intense
pressure due to some
questionable blocks from the
Immortals O-Line. Fortunately,
the defence came out firing
on all cylinders and after a
series of big plays, got the
first score of the day with
Jonas ‘More-muscles-than-
brains’ Schwenck sacking the
Bears’ QB in the endzone.
Not wanting to be outdone
the Immortals Offense upped
their game, scoring on the
following two drives with
powerful and evasive runs
from Jason and running back
Guillaume ‘Cheerleader’
Fontan capping off long,
composed drives. Half time
score: 14-0.
The Immortals came
out in the second half all
guns blazing, scoring
two touchdowns in quick
succession. The first coming
from a Marshawn Lynch-
esque run from Offensive
MVP Guillaume and the
second due to a strip sack
from Overall MVP Henners
‘Exclusively Canine’ Turner
leading to Defensive MVP
Harry ‘0 Picks, 0 Aves’
Lawrence picking the ball up
and scurrying to the endzone
to extend the Immortals’ lead
to four scores. On the next
drive, a quick wide receiver
screen and a momentary
lapse in concentration led
to the Bears’ sole score
of the day. Shout out to
Will ‘Loosey’ Coidan for a
diabolical tackle attempt,
taking out his own pursuing
defender and crushing
any dreams of consecutive
shutouts. The defence made
amends with several big plays

hockey (or
Octopush as it
is often called)
is a competitive
sport combining
hockey and snorkelling,
played on the bottom of a
swimming pool. The rules are
similar to hockey, but with
shorter sticks (about a foot
long), meaning players must
dive to the bottom of the pool
to flick the weighted puck
along the pool floor and into
the goal. With IC member
numbers tripling compared
to last year, it could be said
Octopush is one of Imperial’s
fastest growing sports.
With the captain falling out
of the car having arrived over
an hour early, we made a
keen first impression. This was
the first tournament for all of
our novices, where they put
their skills to the test against
Warwick and host Oxford’s
counterparts, winning every
match and bringing home the
Novice Star. As Imperial’s
first all-novice team in several
Great Britain internationally
was never going to be easy,
but helped improve skills and
tactics to fight back stronger
next time. Accused of remov-
ing the puck from the goal,
we fought our case that it was
not completely across the line
(where’s underwater goal-line
technology when you need
it?). Debating the intricacies
of the rulebook in gameplay,
we picked a fight with the
wrong player, who pro-
ceeded to announce he was
a qualified referee. It turned
out he was not close enough
to see how it was balanced
just on the edge; not quite in.
Enjoying a Thai banquet with
the hosts afterwards, we set-
tled our differences about the
rule book and were pleased
to leave our trophy in the
Scuba stores for our fellow
society members to discover
At this point you must be
telling yourself “by Jove, this
is the sport for me!”. Well,
fear not, aspiring water-baby,
as newcomers are always
welcome to try it for free. If
you are interested in giving it
a shot, come down to Ethos
Thursdays 20:00-22:00,

With the novices making up
the numbers and joining the
two seniors in their tourna-

for a turbulent ride but gave
