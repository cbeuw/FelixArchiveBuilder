The Children
is a triumph
of acting and
staging
F
rom the moment The
Children – written by
Olivier Award winner,
Lucy Kirkwood –
begins, the on-stage
chemistry between
Rose and Hazel is a joy to
behold. Played by Francesca
Annis and Deborah Findlay
respectively, the juxtaposition
between the calm and uptight
exterior of Rose and the
scatterbrain Hazel leads to
an opening that is nothing
short of hilarious, in a play
that is as laugh-out-loud funny
as it is touching.
Rose, Hazel, and Hazel’s
husband Robin – played
by Ron Cook – are retired
nuclear scientists, having
previously built and worked
together at a coastal plant.
Some months prior, the plant
goes into meltdown and, with
their home now a threat to
their lives, Hazel and Robin
are forced to move into a
seaside cottage outside the
exclusion zone. It is then,
after decades apart, that
Rose arrives unannounced.
Despite the pretence of
friendliness, it is clear neither
woman carries a great deal
of affection for the other; both
dismissive or blasée to each
other’s jokes and anecdotes.
When Robin appears on
stage it is clear why – Rose
is most definitely in love with
her ex-colleague and he
with her. As a matter of fact,
they’ve been having an affair
for years. This is by no means
a spoiler, you’d have to be
blind and deaf not to spot
it a mile off. Which is good
because, although it plays an
important role in the plot, it
does not serve as the perfor-
mance’s main dilemma – that
is not to be spoiled.
The premise of three retirees
in their late sixties chatting
in a cottage is, on the face
of it, rather drab. Yet what
is presented over the course
of two hours (no interval, so
make use of the lavatories
while you can) is a dialogue
and set of actions that is, right
now, taking place amongst
groups of students all over the
country. Bad food is eaten,
home-made wine is guzzled,
characters gossip, reminisce,
talk over one another, mutter
sarcastic comments, disguise
flirting with fighting, dance to
their favourite song, and pour
their drunk little hearts out.
The cottage itself even feels
like a student house with its
damaged furniture, blocked
toilet, and general feeling of
decrepitude. Far from being
dull, were the play two hours
of chat between Rose, Hazel
Adam Gellatly
and Robin, it would have no
problem providing a thor-
oughly enjoyable spectacle.
Just underneath the surface
of Kirkwood’s witty dialogue,
however, is a twist that adds
drama and a wonderfully
engaging narrative to the
play, forcing the audience to
reanalyse all that has come

beforehand. Once the true
nature of events is revealed, a
new layer is added to each of
the protagonists' personality;
this propels the production
from good to great. It is
at this point when, despite
feeling inconsequential at the
beginning of the play, age

is of the utmost importance.
Lines that had once appeared
as throwaway now take on
a new level of poignancy;
the character development
that Kirkwood has employed
could quite easily be the sub-
ject of an essay. An explicit
resolution to the play’s central
problem is never reached, but
the combined effort of script,
direction, and acting provide
enough of an insight into
the souls of Rose, Hazel and
Robin that it needn’t one.
On a technical note, the
staging serves to add,
rather than distract from the
performances. The set leans
at a slight angle – fitting for
an old cottage on a hill –
alluded to only by a rolling
apple and the accumulation
of water in one corner. The
lighting changes subtly with
the passing of time, or with
the arrival of a car outside
the kitchen window. Robin
and Hazel’s cottage has
no electricity until 10pm
each day, and the transition
from the faint glow of gas
lamps to the bright lamps,
coincides perfectly with a
reinvigoration of Rose’s spirit
during an intimate scene
with Robin.
Although talked about
constantly, no children ever
appear during The Children.
A child, however, can be
heard laughing at all the
jokes and quips; not from
the stage, but the audience.
The youthful laugh from
the lower circle is so fitting
to the play’s underlying
message, the more cynical
audience members might
think she was a shill. The
Children is a remarkable
telling of how in spite of old
age – with all its physical
limitations and responsibil-
ities – our human desires,
aspirations, flaws, anxieties,
and humour differ little from
when we were young.
