King Lear is a
hit and miss at
the Barbican
H
ow does a
creative team
begin to tackle
the momentous
task of
reincarnating a
play that has been performed
and studied for centuries? Do
they period dress the stage
and cast, and risk being
forgotten in the plethora of
Shakespeare productions?
Or do they approach the
play from an entirely new
angle knowing that, should
they fail, being a forgotten
production would turn from
curse to blessing? The Royal
Shakespeare Company’s
production of King Lear at the
Barbican opts for a mixture
of the two, leading to an
adaptation that trips over
itself too often to fall in love
with it.
Directed by Gregory
Doran, and starring Sir
Anthony Sher as Lear, the
play opens well. A minimal-
ist set – brick wall backdrop,
with rising central panel
to allow for the arrival of
characters – onto which
King Lear and his throne
are carried. The dispersion
of incense from the stage,
the black and gold colour
palette of the characters,
and the beautifully subtle
live music create a surprising
sense of place. And the
subtle changes to the set
during the 3 hour perfor-
mance, for the most part,
allow the imagination to
fill in the blanks where the
stage does not. Characters
appear stage right to depict
a hallway leading to a great
chamber, faint whispers
of seagulls and waves are
heard as Edgar and the Earl
of Gloucester hike along the
Dover seafront, and crickets
chirp as night falls.
When the design choices
do not work, however, they
feel either clumsy or rushed.
Anachronisms appear
for no reasonable artistic
basis: early 20th
century
leather suitcases carried
by sword wielding dukes,
and what is meant to be a
cloak disguising Edgar, is
actually just a grey hoodie.
Nowhere is the design more
painful to behold than in
Act 3 Scene 7 – the blinding
of the Earl of Gloucester.
Painful, sadly, for the wrong
reasons. A Perspex cube
acts as Gloucester’s torture
chamber, thus allowing the
smearing of blood, and
drawing gasps from the
more squeamish audi-
ence members. Granted,
Adam Gellatly
conveying the removal of
two small organs to an entire
theatre is difficult, but the
addition of the transpar-
ent box sticks out so badly
among the regal gowns, all
sense of horror is lost. The
scene is made even more
awkward when a wounded
Duke of Cornwall goes out
of his way to enter the cube,
simply so we can have more
blood smearing. Forget
the acting, now you really
know he’s hurt! The whole
fiasco is rounded off when
technical difficulties cause a
5 minute interruption to the
performance, the untimely
nature of which has clearly
disrupted the acting of
Oliver Johnstone as Edmond
when Act 4 is allowed to
commence.
Despite this hiccup, John-
stone’s performance is very
good, particularly in Act 3
Scene 4, when Edgar has
descended into madness,
and meets Lear, who is in
turn well down the road
to insanity. Sher’s perfor-
mance, although marred
by audibility problems in
the opening scene – please
stop turning your back to
the audience – provides the
two most powerful scenes

in the play: Act 3 Scene 2,
where in a raging storm Lear
and his Fool are projected
upward on a mechanical
platform and the old king
curses his ill treatment with
an intensity to match the
wonderful stage direction,
and the play’s final scene,
where in stark contrast to
3.2, a dying Lear caresses
his dead daughter, Cordelia.
Of all the cast, however, it is
Anthony Byrne as the Earl of
Kent who fills his role best.
After banishment by Lear,
his return as the disguised
Caius – bald and now with a
Geordie accent – inhabits a
new character so greatly, it
would be no surprise if those
unfamiliar to King Lear did
not recognise him until he is
revealed as Kent near the
play's end.
This being said, as with
the set design, the character
portrayals sometimes spark
bemusement. Edmond, the
bastard son of Gloucester
who betrays his father,
and brother, should be a
character that sparks as
much disgust from the audi-
ence as Goneril or Regan.
Instead, Paapa Essideu’s
performance is more comic
relief; it works of course –
snarky off-hand comments
and winks to the audience
– drawing laughs a plenty.
Sadly, the overall result is
that upon his killing at the
hands of Edgar, it is impossi-
ble for one to feel joy at the
downfall of the script’s true
menace.
Yet, with all the issues
surrounding this production,
it is still Shakespeare, and
the performances are strong
enough to hold together
what is perhaps his most
tragic of tragedies. Having
combined both the Quarto
and Folio texts of the King
Lear there’s enough meat
to satisfy avid Shakespeare
fans,and newcomers will find
the narrative, at the very
least, engaging. Upon leav-
ing the theatre, however,
both parties are likely to be
left pondering the play’s cre-
ative decisions, and not one
of literature’s saddest tales.
T
he Royal Opera
House’s The
Nutcracker, like
the switching on
of the lights on
Oxford Street,
or the Selfridge’s window
display, marks London’s
countdown to Christmas. The
Christmas themed ballet is
a tradition that has roots in
Imperial Russia. The ballet,
which was commissioned by
the director of the Russian
Imperial theatres – complete
with score from Pyotr Ilyich
Tchaikovsky, story by Marius
Petipa (who based it on a
E.T.A Hoffman fairytale), and
choreography by Lev Ivanov
– was first performed in 1892
at the Mariinsky Theatre in
St Petersburg. At the time, it
received negative reviews,
but since then, countless
adaptations around the world
have ensured its place as
one of the most well known,
and most beloved ballets.
The score and the story are
so ubiquitous in Western art,
and music, that the chances
are you will have heard bars
of The Dance of Sugarplum
Fairy, even if you’re not able
to name it as such.
The ballet follows the story
of Clara, a young girl who
sneaks out of bed one night
to play with her new toy,
the Nutcracker, only to be
transported to a wonderland
by the travelling magician,
Drosselmeyer. In this Kingdom
of Sweets, she battles a
mouse army, witnesses the
Nutcracker transform into
the Prince, and travels to the
palace, where she is greeted
by Sugar Plum Fairy and her
court. Over 400 perfor-
mances have taken place
at the Royal Opera House
alone. The present ROH
adaptation is choreographed
by Peter Wright, who first
adapted the ballet in the
1980s for the Royal Ballet. His
revision turned back decades
of tweaks; Wright collab-
orated with a musicologist
Roland John Wiley, to bring a
version to the stage that was
as faithful to the 19th
century
original as possible.
The Wright version, per-
formed by the Royal Ballet,
has been recorded and
televised numerous times, and
has thus set a standard by
which all other performances
are danced. None of this cen-
tury’s worth of stifling history
seems to sit heavily on the
dancers' shoulders, each of
whom dance with abandon in
their performance. Franscesca

the performance of a young
girl just right –vulnerable,
wondering, but with plenty of
pluck; she is quick-footed and
teasing as she shows off her
new toy to her brother in the
opening scenes, bold as she
brings down the Mouse King
with a well aimed strike of
a heel. When Drosselmayer

casts his spell to whisk her
away to the Kingdom of
Sweets, she truly seems to
shrink down, Alice-like, as
the Christmas tree behind her
grows, and grows – filling the
entire height of the cavernous
Royal Opera House.
On the night I saw the
performance, as the Sugar
Plum Fairy and her prince
respectively, Lauren Cuth-
bertson and Federico Bonelli
danced to thunderous rounds

of applause. Cuthbertson was
inundated with bouquets of
flowers as she took her bows,
deservedly so: at points she
seemed to fly, leaping and
pirouetting across the stage
in a show of breathtaking
athleticism and skill. Bonelli
was never quite able to
reach Cuthbertson’s virtuoso
heights, but partnered her
admirably, highlighting his
own talent in his solo piece.
From my perch in the upper
amphitheatre, the artifice of
the stage below was appar-
ent, but this did nothing to
hamper the charm. Rather the
action seemed to take place
in a gigantic doll’s house,
rather like the doll’s house
with which Clara plays in the
opening scenes of the pro-
duction. The set whirled and
transfigured itself; cosy rooms
melted into snow filled town
squares, only to be replaced
by wintry fields, giving way
to sumptuous palaces. Julia
Trevelyan Oman’s beautifully
crafted set design borrows
from the look of the 19th
cen-
tury Imperial Russia; glitter,
and gilt abound. The King-
dom of Sweets seems entirely
built entirely from spun sugar.
This is a light, frothy produc-
tion, the two hours fly by - I
left the theatre in a state of
childlike wonder, thoroughly
in the Christmas mood.
There is no subversion, no
new edgy angle, the Royal
Ballet and Wright have
chosen not to reinvent the
wheel; wisely so. The Nut-
cracker is deeply traditional,
performed and staged with
excellence: happily, it wears
none of the weariness that
we might expect from such
a long running production.
Peter Wright’s 90th
birth-
day fell during this run, this
year’s production is a fitting
celebration and tribute to the
one-of-a-kind dancer, and
artistic director.
