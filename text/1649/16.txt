A Return to
Stars Hollow |
Gilmore Girls
Indira Malik
Gilmore Girls is a well-loved
multi-generational drama set
in a picturesque Connecticut
town. Its original run was a
cultural touchstone, and its
popularity made it an ideal
candidate for Netflix’s recent
revival spree. How does the
revival compare?
R
eviving beloved
TV shows can be
a tricky business.
Shows that are
missed tend to build
up a mythology
around them; with time and
absence, every fault and
inconsistency is forgiven. To
bring them back, however,
is to burst the rose tinted
bubble of fond nostalgia and
push them into the harsh lens
of reality. For the creators,
raising the old magic from
the dead is a nigh impossible
task, as the latest revival of
the X-Files proved.
Gilmore Girls, a genera-
tional show about mothers
and daughters, was set
against the backdrop of a
quirky town in Connecticut. It
aired for seven seasons and
went off the air nine years
ago. The show creator, Amy
Sherman Palladino, left the
show at the end of the sixth
season in the wake of failed
contract negotiations. Having
handed over her show, she
gave interviews in which she
shared that she had already
planned the show’s trajectory,
including the intriguing ‘four
last words’. Thus, for its final
season, a case of Schröding-
er’s Gilmore Girls was born;
there was one version of
the show that played out on
the CW in weekly episodes,
and another which remained
hidden in Amy Sherman
Palladino’s imagination.
Netflix couldn’t have hoped
for a better sales pitch when
they decided to bring back
the show for a limited run of
four 90-minute episodes this
year. Finally, the world would
see the true Gilmore Girls, the
original vision.
Buzzfeed, AV Club, and
TV Line went to work and
painstakingly curated every
last update from the set; it
seemed every single one of
the original cast members
would be returning: from the
town troubadour, to Sookie,
played by Melissa McCarthy,
whose career has reached
stratospheric heights from her
days of cheerily commanding
the kitchen of The Dragonfly
Inn. There was, of course,
to be one glaring omission
from the cast list, Edward
Herrmann, who played the
Gilmore patriarch Richard
Gilmore and passed away in
2014. How the show would
handle his passing remained
one the most hotly anticipated
aspects of the show’s return,
along with the perennial ques-
tion: ‘Jess or Logan?’.
The series finally dropped
Friday of last week. From the
very first scene of ‘Winter’,
the opening episode of the
revival’s quartet, it is clear
that Amy Sherman Pallad-
ino is very much back in
her element. Exposition-y at
first, understandable for a
show that is working to catch
up its viewers on nearly a
decade of the characters’
lives, Gilmore Girls quickly
settles back into its mile-a-
minute pop culture peppered
dialogue.
Stars Hollow’s cutesy New
England town charm is a
welcome break from the real
world. It seems, as Lorelai
says at one point, truly like
a town inside a snow globe.

seems hardly to have touched
it. What the show fails to say
about the world at large,
it does incredibly well in
its interpersonal dynamics
between the characters.
Edward Herrmann’s absence
is felt keenly; the Gilmore
women: his wife, Emily, his
daughter, Lorelai, and grand-
daughter, Rory, each struggle
to come to terms with their
grief, as well as how best to
honour him throughout the
four episodes.
Emily’s character arc is the
most drastic and the most
satisfying; she leaves behind
a life in Hartford society that
brought her no joy to live
in a cottage in Nantucket,
regaling schoolchildren with
graphic and bloody stories of
whaling at a new job in the
museum. Lorelai finally gets
married to Luke, due to an
epiphany she has behind a
coffee shop (where else for
Lorelai?), after repeatedly
attempting to find herself on
a ‘Wild’ (book) journey fail.

ing moments of the revival,
she calls her mother from

seems to have made

motto. Leading the
charge on diverse
sitcoms, in recent years it has
put out excellent shows like
Black-ish, Fresh off the boat
and, now, Speechless. This
paced in medias res open-
ing sequence that rapidly
establishes the character
dynamics. Minnie Driver is
the well-meaning but embat-
tled mother, competitive and
jumping at the bit to right any
perceived injustices, while
John Ross Bowie (The Big
Bang Theory’s Barry Kripke)
is her sarcastic straight-man
counterpart. Echoing his
father’s wit is the aforemen-
tioned JJ, played by real-life
Cerebral Palsy sufferer Micah

younger siblings: the quintes-
sential middle-child, Ray, and
the hyper-competitive runner
Dylan. An additional appen-
dix to the family comes in the
form of the school grounds-
keeper, Kenneth, acting as an
aide to and the voice of JJ.
The comedy is disarm-
ing and charming, but still
manages to maintain a wry
edge. It very much has the
feel of a John Green or early
Wes Anderson coming of age
comedy, but with a healthier
dose of reality. While it
leans on certain character
archetypes, it never feels
derivativeness. It is refreshingly
optimistic, and while it treats JJ’s
condition seriously, it does not
reduce him to his condition.

that these characters are justified,

real despite their surface-level

her favourite memory of her

catharsis for the two women
who have had a fraught rela-
tionship for the series’ run.
Later, in a scene mirroring
the first ever episode, when
Lorelai asks for money from
her mother, and is asked
to spend time with Emily in
return, there is none of the
bitter resentment that accom-
panied Friday night dinners.
The youngest Gilmore’s
arc by contrast brings no
real comfort. In the original
run, Rory was the bookish
wunderkind that could do
no wrong. She glided on her
brains and her grandparent’s
financial power from Chilton
valedictorian to editor of the
Yale Daily News.
Even a spectacular melt-
down in the later seasons
didn’t hold her down for
long- she graduated top
of her class, and set off
on the campaign trail with
Barack Obama (pre-2008
run): a fledgling Christiane
Amanpour. The revival finds
the early promise of success
shattered, utterly broken, and
chewed up by life. Rory is by
her own admission ‘rootless’,
essentially unemployed,
couch-surfing, and always
on the search for her lucky
underwear (that she never
finds). This is the tragic side
of her millennial identity. She
becomes associated with
the thirty-something club,
the gang of highly qualified
graduates unable to move out
of their parents’ homes.
The show is similarly
unforgiving to the rest of
Rory’s generation. We
were introduced to Lane,
Rory’s childhood friend, as
a sixteen year old desperate
to escape Stars Hollow, and
could be no other ending. We
are left to presume that the
baby is Logan’s, her engaged
college boyfriend with whom
she’s been having an affair.
Just in case we missed the
Christopher-Luke parallels
between Logan and Rory’s
other significant boyfriend,
Jess, we are shown Jess
throwing a very Luke-like
wistful look at Rory in one of
the closing scenes of ‘Fall’.
It’s a neat ending, it ties
everything up in a bow (much
like How I Met Your Mother’s
big reveal that Aunt Robin
was the woman for Ted all
along). It’s clever, it works on
the page.
Yet on screen, it is a faintly
disappointing end to Rory’s
story, a girl who in her
original iteration was more
concerned with chasing
accomplishments than boys .
The Gilmore Girls revival is
successful in many ways in
that it manages to capture
the magic of the original
run, namely its quirkiness
and humour. It delivers both
laughs and tears.
Yet it doesn’t quite live up to
the insanely high expectations
Sherman Palladino built up
for herself. The show seems
unable to move past narrative
symmetry to give its younger
characters’ endings worthy of
their character growth.
The show allows the older
characters (Emily, Luke, and
Lorelai) to grow out of the
lives that no longer make
them happy and into lives that
do, but dooms the younger
generation to retracing the
grooves of their parent’s lives,
trapped in the snow globe of
Stars Hollow.
