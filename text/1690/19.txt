TRAVEL
O
h God, where
am I? All these
trees look the
same. The way
up was easy (it was just,
well, up). But now every
direction is down, I can’t
hear the stream anymore
and I can’t see anything
through these trees.”
Sometimes in life, you
find yourself someplace
odd and you struggle to
understand how you came
to be there.This was one of
those times for me – I was
at the top of a mountain
in the Amazon rainforest,
completely alone, with a
bag of cherimoya seeds in
one hand and a machete
in the other. The trees
were thick; that place
might even be primary
rainforest – a rare thing
to come across where
I was staying, an area
previously used for cattle
farming, with neighbours
who are digging for gold
and planting cash crops.
But our plans for the land,
in comparison, were a
little more ‘out there’,
according to Ecuadorian
standards.
Let me start from the
beginning: I had arrived
in Ecuador four weeks
earlier – my plane landed
in Cuenca, a city popular
with American expats. I
was headed to a commu-
nity called Terra Frutis,
who are trying to create
a vegan permaculture
fruit forest in the Amazon
rainforest. Not wanting
to waste time anywhere
too ‘Americanised’, the
next day I took a scenic
yet frightening 4.5 hour
bus journey from Cuenca
to Gualaquiza in Morona
Santiago province, a town
at the edge of the Amazon
rainforest. I passed
over 20 places labelled
‘peligro’ – the Spanish
word for ‘danger’ – as the
bus wound around moun-
tains across the Andes on
roads that were yet to be
completed. Back home
I don’t take buses, only
trains – not because I’m
stuck up or frightened of
buses, but rather because
if the bus ride is over an
hour long, I will throw
up. And yet I somehow
managed to survive this
4.5 hour bus journey
featuring some harrowing
drops. After a taxi ride
from the bus station, I
arrived at a house I had
only seen in YouTube
videos. I was immediately
greeted by one of the men
who had started the Terra
Frutis community three
years before, wandering
through Peru and Ecuador
until he eventually settled
in this area.
My trip wasn’t a
holiday as such, more like
a summer internship. Most
people have internships

From Imperial to the Amazon jungle
Frutis are situated. I spent
the first week and a half
at the headquarters, a
smaller scale version of
the main project, only
with electricity and the
internet (coming soon to
the farm!). Their ‘yard’ is
full of fruit trees, sugar-
cane, and palms, backing
onto a river suitable for
bathing in. I spent a lot of
my time weeding, which
in Ecuador often involves
cutting shoulder-height
grass with a machete.
The grass is then used as
mulch for the plants. I also
planted many pineapples
and harvested noni, ugly
lemons, and maracuyas.
Tambo is a nice place
but the real project is the
farm, known as Mount
Frutis because of its
location on the side of
a mountain, previously
used for grazing cattle
and not much else. There
are a few ongoing jobs
there: building bungalows
and a community kitchen
in preparation for the
upcoming fruit festival;
planting trees and seeds
gathered from all over
the world; clearing areas
of grass; weeding and
looking after existing
plants; and maintaining
the waterline that brings
water from the stream to
the kitchen. The commu-
nity is trying to become
self-sufficient and aims
to avoid buying new
things where possible,

in a bank or some other
soul-sucking company,
but that’s not the direction
I want to take with my life.
I used to love watching
The Good Life, where the
townies try to become
self-sufficient, converting
their gardens into veggie
plots and making their
own clothes, and the
show inspired me to do
the same – but better. I’m
a big fruit lover, but the
fruit in the UK is only
passable, so I decided to
move to Ecuador (which
has a great climate for all
sorts of fruit) and start a
fruit forest. Thankfully
for my bank account and
sanity, it didn’t come to
that because someone else
had already started a fruit
forest there, so I decided
to join their community
for a trial month.
So now back to
Ecuador. I had just arrived
in Tambo Viejo, where

opting to make the things
they need in most cases.
Tools include a long pole
with a plunger on top for
harvesting papayas, a long
pole with a sharp knife
on the end for harvesting
rollinias, and branches
that bend back like a
scythe for collecting the
grass and other potential
mulch.
So finally, we went to
the farm – we needed to
take a half hour taxi ride,
then a boat journey, and an
uphill walk through deep
mud. This was the begin-
ning of the dry season
but the moisture from
the rainy season hadn’t
managed to escape yet.
I got to the cabin (one of
the seven buildings there)
exhausted, had a short
break, and then started
planting some mangoes.
At that point, my body
was done, and I spent the
next few days feeling faint
and unable to stomach
any food. The rainforest is
unforgiving – if you have
any weakness, it will find
it and make you suffer.
I somehow got back to
Tambo, where I got some
rest, managed to recover,
and then spent my days
eating cherimoya bought
in town.
Cherimoya trees can
grow in this climate but
are unlikely to fruit – I
wasn’t satisfied with
this. I wanted to grow
them at the farm, and so
did others. However, the
problem with growing
cherimoyas out there is
that the altitude isn’t high
enough. So I decided that
I would plant the seeds
at the highest point of
the farm – the top of the
mountain. This area of the
farm was not developed
at all, there were no easy
paths to walk around and
only a handful of people
living at the farm had
been up there previously.
It was an early morning,
and, having soaked the
seeds for four days be-
forehand, I scarified them
against a rock to improve
their chances of sprout-
ing, and started my way
up the mountain alone.
I walked through tall
grass, crossed a river, and
then climbed through the
thick rainforest. The trees
were densely packed but
I kept heading up. After a
while, there seemed to be
no more up – the ground
was flat, and because of
the densely packed trees
I couldn’t see whether it
was going up or down in
any direction. I seemed to
be able to see small pieces
of sky in every direction
however, so I stopped to
have a rest. A member of
the community had given
me a granadilla so that
I could spread the seeds
once I got to the top. I was
hungry so I opened it up
and ate the flesh, spitting
the seeds into holes at the
base of the trees around –
that’s how you plant the
fruit here! Granadillas
grow on vines, so they
need to be planted places
with opportunities to
climb up things.
As I was walking
around, I realised that in
one direction the ground
seemed to go down and
then up again in the
distance – perhaps I
wasn’t at the summit yet?
So I picked up my things
and started moving there.
It was difficult – that area
was even more densely
populated by trees. I got
higher than I had been,
before fallen trees blocked
my path. Beyond them,
I could see the ground
evening off again so I
assumed it to be the real
summit.
I planted the cherimoya
seeds all around and
started to head downhill.
I got to the place I was
before, but I couldn’t
remember which direction
I had come from. I headed
left, but with hindsight
left was completely the
wrong way to go – it
began to take me away
from the farm and into
a neighbour’s property.
Fortunately, I realised
that partway down as I
hit a stream flowing in the
opposite direction to what
I was expecting. And so
I headed back up a little
and then started to make
my way around the peak.
I couldn’t hear the incor-
rect stream anymore so I
kept walking until I heard
water... It was flowing the
correct way, I must be in
the right place! I headed
straight for the stream,
climbed down to cross it,
and, upon realising that
there was no easy way
back up on the other side,
I started walking down the
stream.After a little while,
I found a place to pull
myself up the other side.
Quickly, the trees turned
to grass but I couldn’t rec-
ognise this place – had I
ended up at a neighbour’s
place anyhow? I recited
“lo siento, estoy perdida”
(“sorry, I am lost”) in my
head and kept walking. I
walked past a few banana
palms until I started seeing
buildings – I had made
it back! I was higher up
than when I first crossed
the stream so I still had a
decent victory walk back
down to the kitchen. I
arrived back triumphant, I
had survived the Amazon
rainforest!
The rest of the trip
was more relaxed, mostly
weeding at Tambo and
spending time with the
friends I’ve made. After
gettingusedtothistropical
paradise, I was dreading
returning to England. But
fast forward five months
and I’m back! Not for a
visit but to live. When
they said a maths degree
from Imperial can take
you anywhere, I could
have never imagined it
would take me here.
