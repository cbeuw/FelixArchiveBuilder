A tale of two women

F
ilmgoers looking
for stories of
complex women
struggling to
succeed in a man’s world,
which simultaneously
serve as an exploration
and critique of a particu-
lar cultural moment are
this week, surprisingly,
spoiled for choice.
Funny Cow (Dir: Adrian
Shergold) and Let the
Sunshine In (Dir: Claire
Denis) – which came out
last week – are two films
about emotionally-com-
plex women, played by
Maxine Peake and Juliette
Binoche respectively, with
a focus on conversation
and language, and a deep
understanding of time and
place.
In Let the Sunshine In,
the time is now, and the
place is France. Or Paris,
to be more precise – the
Paris of aesthetes and
lovers, who tend towards
the philosophical and
dress chicly, with nary a
banlieue in sight. Binoche
plays Isabelle, a divorced
artist looking for her true
love and crying herself
to sleep at night. We
follow Isabelle as she
passes through the arms
of a number of unsuitable
men – unsuitable, in some
cases, because they are
possessive and boorish,
while in others Isabelle
makes herself unsuitable
by locking herself away in
her upper-class bubble.
The whole film – which
was based on Roland
Barthes’ A Lover’s Dis-
course: Fragments, and
written by Denis and
collaborator Christine
Angot – is meditative
and slow-moving; to say
it veers into indulgence
would be an understate-
ment. Most of the film is
taken up by conversations
between Isabelle and the
men in her life, during
which Denis’ camera
languidly swings between
“Binoche is
– as usual –
resplendent
in Let the
Sunshine In”
the two sets of faces like
a ponderous metronome.
These sequences are
enjoyable, up to a point,
but heavy dialogue masks
a sense that little of real
value is being said.
Binoche, is – as usual
– resplendent in the role,
giving a performance that
is imbued with a blinding
glow. Despite the dia-
logue-heavy nature of the
script, Binoche displays
the most affecting aspects
of her performance when
she relies solely on her
expression to sell the
story: staring out of a train
window, lost for words.
Peake is Funny Cow
– she plays the titular
character, who is never
afforded a name – always
manages to find the right
words. Set in the North
of England in the 1970s
and 80s, the film charts
the life of Funny Cow,
a working class woman
trying to break into the
male-dominated comedy
circuit. The funniest thing
about Funny Cow, is,
surprisingly, the lack of
humour. Instead, Shergold
has taken the opportunity
to explore the limitations
and strictures placed upon
women by society.
As with Binoche,
Peake is by far the best
thing about Funny Cow.
With an exceptional
ear for dialogue, Peake
delivers each line to
perfection, often re-
verting to the deadpan
sarcasm that served as an
emotional shield for her
while growing up. It’s
the cumulative effect of
small details that really
sell her performance – the
range of emotions Peake’s
face goes through as
she struggles through an
abortive audition, filmed
in relentless close-up, or
the fact her hands remain
trembling even when she
manages to blast through
in her first live set.
In both films, the lead
actors’ abilities mean
their support tends to
fade into the background
a little bit; Let the
Sunshine In ends with
a memorable exchange
between Binoche and
Gerard Depardieu, who
plays a fortune-teller, and
in Funny Cow Peake is
ably supported by Paddy
Considine as Angus, who
plays her middle-class
lover, but both films serve
as showcases for an indi-
vidual talent.
Both films excel in ex-
ploring a particular social
class. In Let the Sunshine
In, it’s the upper-class
world of bankers and art
dealers; a metropolitan
elite, sipping champagne,
who probably haunt Nigel
Farage’s nightmares.
Funny Cow explores the
polar opposite: working
class Northern communi-
ties who were decimated
by Thatcherism through-
out the 1980s, and have
yet to recover. Funny Cow
explores, in affecting,
depressing detail, the
way cycles of poverty
and violence are passed
down through generations
– Funny Cow’s abusive
father dies when she is
young, but it’s not long
before she too is trapped
in a relationship with a
violent man, from whom
she manages to escape. In
a lesser film, Considine’s
Angus would act as a
corrective for Funny Cow,
introducing her to a world
of culture and class, but
she recognises this, too,
can be a form of violence.
But while both films
show the protagonist at
the mercy of men, Funny
Cow creates a well-round-
ed, realistic character, who
has her own lived experi-
ence and vitality. Isabelle,
on the other hand, exists
solely in relation to the
men around her. We are
told, or must presume, she
is a successful artist, yet
she is only seen working
on a canvas once, and
we know next to nothing
about her life outside of
its romances. Her char-
acter is like a ghost, and
the film has a hollowness
at its centre that does
not satisfy. While Funny
Cow can often feel over-
ly-structured or fragment-
ed – a result, perhaps,
of the director’s ample
experience in television –
it is much more satisfying
than the naturalism Denis
offers up.
Both films are marked
by a lack of resolution:
Isabelle and Funny Cow
both have futures left
wide open. While Funny
Cow is more triumphant,
it refuses an easy ending
– instead of having Funny
Cow beat the male comics
at their own game, or
transcend an arena of
comedy so reliant on
racism, sexism, and hom-
ophobia, she joins them
in punching down. Funny
Cow and Let the Sunshine
In both end with things
still in play: Peake and
Binoche deserve nothing
less.
