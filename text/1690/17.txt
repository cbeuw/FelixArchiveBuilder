Isle of Dogs: A cute tail that lacks some bite
I
t’s been four years
since the release of
The Grand Budapest
Hotel, a commercial
and critical success for di-
rector Wes Anderson. It’s
a tough act to follow, but
Isle of Dogs is a delightful
addition to Anderson’s
body of work – his
offbeat filmmaking style
translates impressively to
animation, which captures
his playfully childish
world with wonder.
It’s 20 years in the
future, and in Japan’s
Megasaki City’s author-
itarian leader Mayor
Kobayashi exiles all dogs
to Trash Island due to an
outbreak of canine flu
virus. Six months later,
Atari, the nephew of the
Mayor, crash lands on
Trash Island in search of
his dog, Spots, who was
the first dog banished by
the decree. Atari is aided
by a trusty band of five
dogs, who are now given
a purpose: to search for
Spots, and ultimately
rekindle the companion-
ship between man and
dogs.
Firstly, the film is a
visual treat. The puppets
and the sets are masterful-
ly made, and there is pure
joy in observing just how
everything moves and
interacts. The animation
is beautiful and there is
endless pleasure in the
details that breathe life
into this world and its
characters. In the scenes
on Trash Island, the visual
style is greasy and gritty:
it coherently captures an
apocalyptic landscape,
with mountains of debris,
overgrown fields, smoggy
skies, and rusty colour
palettes. There is plenty
for hardcore Anderson
fans to fetishize, as the
film is full of title cards,
symmetrical shots, maps,
deadpan dialogue, and
almost everyone in the
film is a complete intro-
vert. Anderson obsesses
over the framing, and his
attention to detail in his
composition is exactly
what you would expect.
It’s nothing new from
Anderson; he does the
thing he does best, and
there is some comfort to
that.
Like Anderson’s other
films, Isle of Dogs has a
darkly comic streak that
has a sharp bite to it. Just
ten minutes in, a brawl
between dogs ends with
an ear being chewed off
and thrown away where
rats nibble at it; Mayor
Kobayashi’s moustached
face is plastered onto a
giant screen invoking
images of Big Brother
from 1984; there are
scenes of dogs being
rounded up into cages to
be gassed; a young boy
has bits of metal piping
sticking out of the side of
his head for an unhealthy
amount of time. Moments
of unexpected violence
or dark themes become
almost an antidote to
the relentless kookiness.
The abstract world that
Anderson creates gets in-
stantly grounded in reality
and its consequences.
This undercurrent of
violence is an impor-
tant characteristic to
Anderson’s storytelling
style, as it reinforces the
importance of the char-
acters’ motives. In Isle of
Dogs this is underplayed.
As a result, the film sits
awkwardly between the
boundary of being an
“animated kids’ film”
or being a full-throttle
Anderson film, and never
quite decides which.
With all the juggling of
heavy ideas, Anderson
fails to reach a satisfying
conclusion. The narrative
goes through several di-
versions that seem to swirl
aimlessly around the point
it wants to make.
While the film is clear
in its stance against
oppression and injustice,
the primary voice of
reason comes from Tracy,
an American foreign
exchange student with a
hunch. This clouds the
intentions of the film,
and is at conflict with the
socio-political subtext it
tries to retain.
Many debates have
been sparked on whether
the film itself is racist:
its touristy portrayal of
Japan and the blissful
ignorance of the majority
of the Japanese people is
somewhat problematic,
but Anderson sets the
film in Japan for largely
aesthetic reasons, and
shows that he is (at least
superficially) in love with
Japanese culture. There is
a fantastical and celebra-
tory air in the marriage
between modern Western
and ancient Asian tradi-
tions in Megasaki.
Does Isle of Dogs triv-
ialise Japanese culture?
I feel like Anderson
would not have made a
different film in light of
these concerns, as his
whole filmmaking style
is based on an unbounded
and childish creativity.
The Japanese dialogue
is not subtitled but trans-
lated through different
characters or inferred
through the voice acting
and animation. This
pushes for more sympathy
towards the dogs who all
speak English but don’t
understand the Japanese.
I didn’t find it offensive
or racist, but I wonder
how a Japanese speaking
audience would view the
film.
The film is successful
in working on a number
of different levels: a story
about a boy finding his
lost dog; a stance against
corruption, xenophobia,
and oppression; even as
an advert for Japanese
tourism. The film’s
internal politics weren’t
too concerning while
I was watching it, but
becomes more problem-
atic as I think about it in
retrospect. Isle of Dogs
is the longest stop-mo-
tion animated film ever
made, and it certainly
feels it. The charm of the
eccentric dialogue quickly
wears off when it teters
into overindulgence,
especially in the final
third. It isn’t as funny as it
ought to be, and partly to
blame is its ambiguity in
whether it really wants to
accommodate for younger
audiences and portray a
sugar-coated version of
Anderson’s dark universe.
Anderson may not be at
his best, but Isle of Dogs
brings joy as a visually
arresting film that has
flourishes of his signature
tropes.
Wes Anderson shows us how much he loves dogs and Japan in his latest film.
