KOD – Rushed execution holds J. Cole back
Following on from his critically-acclaimed 4 Your Eyez Only, J. Cole’s latest release, KOD, is marked by mature
lyrical content, but is hampered by sloppy technique.
N
orth Carolina
rapper, J. Cole,
famous for
his poetically
colourful and hard-hitting
lyricism, as well as his
smooth charisma, comes
through on KOD to tell
his tales of addiction and
drug abuse. In contrast to
his previous release – the
critically-acclaimed,
commercially successful,
and highly political 4
Your Eyez Only – J. Cole
focuses a lot more on
personal stories, experi-
ences, and life lessons,
putting his politics on the
back seat. This change in
thematic focus is reflected
in the instrumental and
vocal arrangements of
the album: the vocals are
often subdued and distant;
the samples are calm and
atmospheric; the beats
feel more laid back. On
some tracks he makes
use of a female narrator,
who brings the deeper
concepts of the album to
the forefront, elucidating
ideas about life, suffering,
and how it is important
to ‘choose wisely’ when
deciding on how to deal
with this suffering.
The only listed features
on this album are from
kiLL edward, performing
on the songs ‘The Cut
Off’ and ‘FRIENDS’. He
generally does the songs
justice, especially his part
in ‘FRIENDS’, which
is outstanding, but his
delivery of the hook on
‘The Cut Off’ does come
off a little awkward, and
the performance is also a
bit messy at times.
This actually seems to
be a pervasive problem
“There are
moments
where
immersion
into J. Cole’s
world is nearly
impossible”
unsurprisingly, the only
one that has gotten the
video treatment so far.
There are no songs like
‘Deja Vu’, ‘Neighbours’,
or ‘No Role Modelz’ on
this record.
Cole’s bars are as
powerful as ever and his
charm still shines through,
and this saves a lot of the
record, in my opinion. But
none of this really matters
when the songs are fun-
damentally uninteresting
and unmemorable. Were
it not for the themes he
touches upon and the
relevance of these to the
culture we live in at the
moment, I would have to
give him a much lower
score. The surface stories
about drug addiction and
social media romances
serve as a gateway to
much deeper philosophi-
cal ideas about life.
Also, rather surprising-
ly, J. Cole heavily censors
his own words on this
record, using tape stop
effects to blur out profan-
ities. At first this put me
off, but I now think it was
done for a good reason:
Cole tries to portray
himself as a father-figure
in the hip-hop scene on
this record, even more so
than on 4 Your Eyez Only.
By removing the profanity
he can avoid the ‘parental
advisory’ sticker on his
album cover and thus
reach a younger audience.
In a culture of increasing
nihilism and a greater
sense of aimlessness,
young people will look
for strong father figures
to point them in the right
direction.
The last track on the
album, ‘1985’, is a sort
of diss track aimed at all
the new, up-and-coming
SoundCloud rappers (Lil’
Pump, 6ix9ine etc.). I call
it a ‘sort of diss track’
because it isn’t aimed at
anyone specifically, but
rather sees J. Cole trying
to mentor younger artists
in the ways of the music
industry, warning them
about the dangers of
excess and chasing trends.
I have very mixed
feelings about this album.
While the subject matter
and the lyrics, as well as
J. Cole’s personality, are
as great as ever, there are
sore spots on this record
which cannot be ignored.
Artists of Cole’s caliber
shouldn’t make the kinds
of mistakes that he makes
on this release. Apparent-
ly he recorded this album
within a timespan of two
weeks. It shows.

with this album: the re-
cording of the vocals feels
rushed. The lyricism and
production are as strong as
ever, and, in my opinion,
the themes are the best
J. Cole has ever touched
upon. Unfortunately,
however, there are a few
moments in which immer-
sion into the world J. Cole
is trying create becomes
nearly impossible. Vocal
performances which are
way off key and/or sloppy
ruin the moody atmos-
phere that the songs are
trying to convey.
A good example of this
would be ‘Once an Addict
(Interlude)’: muffled
electric pianos playing
moody chords open the
song, instantaneously im-
mersing you. But then, out
of nowhere, a vocal line,
so off key it would even
make your drunk friends
at the karaoke bar cringe,
pulls you right out of that
immersion. “Something’s
got a hold on me”, Cole
croons in a pitch that
sounds way too high for
his register.
Another problem this
album suffers from is
that none of the songs are
particularly memorable.
There is a severe lack of
strong hooks throughout
this record, save for one
track, ‘ATM’, which
stands out quite clearly as
the strongest song. It is,
