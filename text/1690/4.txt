A study organised
by the NUS and
the 1752 Group
found widespread
sexual misconduct,
inadequate support.

O
ver 40% of
respondents
to a survey re-
cently carried
out by the 1752 Group
reported experiencing
sexual misconduct by a
member of higher edu-
cation (HE) staff on at
least one occasion.
The online survey,
carried out by the Na-
tional Union of Students
(NUS) and the 1752
Group, which campaigns
to end sexual misconduct
in higher education,
collected 1839 responses
from current and former
students around the UK.
One in eight respondents
reported being touched
in a manner that made
them uncomfortable,
while 65 current and
former students have had
QTR Restaurant to close through summer term
T
he Queen’s
Tower Rooms
R e s t a u r a n t
will be closed
throughout the entire
summer term, Imperial
College London has
announced, as the space
is to be used as a venue
for examinations.
The move, which
comes following a trial in
January, will see the outlet
– which is usually open
for lunch on weekdays
for all students and staff –
filled with students taking
summer exams. It will
be closed throughout the
summer break, and will
not reopen until October
2018.
In a statement, the
College said the change
was “part of longer term
efforts to improve facili-
ty-related student exam-
ination experiences”,
saying it was “directly
linked to over 500 indi-
vidual pieces of student
feedback about what
constitutes an acceptable
examination venue.”
Students are invited to
use the Senior Common
Room restaurant during
this period, which is
usually only open to
postgraduate students and
staff.
However, students and
staff Felix spoke to cited
long-running concerns
over the length of queues
at Imperial-owned outlets,
which could be exacerbat-
ed by the decision to tem-
porarily close the Queen’s
Tower Rooms Restaurant.
Following the launch
of the Campus Services
Survey by Imperial
College Union earlier this
year, one academic report-
ed receiving complaints
from students about long
waiting times. “They
usually only get one hour
to eat between lectures,
and are not happy to
spend their lunch break in
a queue or finding a seat.”
they said, “They do not
have time to eat or relax.”
The survey was
triggered, in part, by
wide ranging changes to
campus services that went
into effect last summer,
including removal of
cooked SCR breakfasts.
non-consensual sex with a
staff member. 15 respond-
ents reported being sexu-
ally assaulted or raped by
a staff member.
The survey found the
perpetrators of these acts
were mostly academics
rather than other staff
members. Around 60% of
reported perpetrators were
men and 13% women;
these gender ratios were
also seen with victims,
with women being more
likely than men to expe-
rience sexual misconduct.
Nearly 15% of postgrad-
uate respondents reported
being made to take part
in sexualised discussions,
compared to 6% of under-
graduates.
A lack of boundaries
within student-staff rela-
tionships were also high-
lighted in the report. 80%
of respondents felt staff
having sexual relation-
ships with students made
them ‘somewhat’ to ‘very
uncomfortable’, while
40% felt uncomfortable
about getting drunk with
staff members.
Misconduct had a
notable effect on victims,
ranging from loss of
confidence to a change in
degree course or career
path. Reporting of such
incidents was found to be
lacking, with only 10%
of respondents reporting
misconduct to their insti-
tution, the major reason
being that victims are
unsure if the behaviour
was serious enough to
warrant complaint.
Where incidents are
reported, 90% of respond-
ents felt institutions failed
to adequately respond,
with some saying institu-
tions rendered the process
difficult or even denied
the incident altogether.
Only one in four respond-
ents found that their Uni-
versity or College took
proactive steps to prevent
misconduct.
Dr Emma Chapman, a
research fellow at Imperi-
al who is a member of the
1752 Group told Felix:
“This research rightly
placed accountability not
just on the perpetrators
but also on the univer-
sity frameworks which
protect them. Inadequate
reporting pathways and
opaque and discriminato-
ry disciplinary processes
keep higher education a
gendered experience and
prevent true equal access
to education.”
Last month Felix
reported on their
college-wide survey
investigating sexism at
Imperial. It found that
40% of respondents had
faced misogyny, and
70% had experienced
derogatory comments
from peers. Only one in
three respondents agreed
enough support was given
to discrimination victims.
Commenting on the
report, the College stated:
“Imperial is committed to
promoting an environment
where everyone feels safe,
supported, and respected.
Any kind of sexual assault
or harassment is entirely
unacceptable and has no
place within our commu-
nity”.
Professor Stephen
Curry, Assistant Provost
for Equality, Diversity,
and Inclusion, who spoke
to Felix last month, said:
“One of the major pieces
of work we’re starting is
a working group dealing
with sexual harassment at
the university. It will look
across the board at staff
and student experiences,
and come up with a unified
set of policies and proce-
dures that create a credible
reporting system”.
Dr Chapman said:
“Universities need to
urgently invest in tackling
this issue and I am happy
to say that Imperial is one
of the universities leading
this charge with their
newly convened sexual
harassment policy reform
working group. I hope to
see courage to admit fault
and commitment to invest
from Imperial and the
sector as a whole.”
