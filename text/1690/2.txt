staff across the College
identifying as female –
the number of women
drops significantly within
research and academic
settings: the most recent
publicly-available Equali-
ty and Diversity Commit-
tee (E&DC) report, from
July 2016, showed only
38% of research staff and
20% of academic staff
were women.
This gap widens as
staff progress through the
ranks of employment: as
of 2016, there were 533
male professors com-
pared to 94 female ones,
with the data showing a
progressive attrition of
women as they progress
through pay grades.
Out of the 20 heads of
departments, only three
are women – Professor
Dame Amanda Fisher of
the Institute of Clinical
Sciences, Professor Anne
Dell of the Department of
Life Sciences, and Profes-
sor Michele Dougherty,
the newly-installed Head
of the Department of
Physics. None of the four
faculty deans are women.
A number of staff and
early-career academics
Felix spoke to said this
lack of representation had
knock-on impacts for their
learning experience.
One postdoctoral
academic, who has re-
cently finished her PhD
at Imperial, told Felix: “I
think visibility makes a
difference. I feel so em-
powered by the amazing
women I’ve worked with
at Imperial, and those who
most impacted me person-
ally from an academic
standpoint were women.
I think that’s because they
were all people who were
making a deliberate point
to build up women and
empower them.”
She went on to discuss
some of the reasoning
behind the disparity:
“As a postdoc you’re at
unfortunately for what-
ever reason women seem
to suffer from that.” “At
stages above postdoc”,
she added, “it’s a leader-
ship role, and there will
be a bias towards hiring
men.”
A recent study pub-
lished in Research Policy
that followed 20,000
doctoral students found
female students were more
likely to gain an academic
job if their supervisor was
a woman. They were also
more likely to publish in
a high-impact journal.
Another recent study
reported gender parity in
STEM subjects was still
a way off, with men likely
to outnumber women in
publishing in scientific
fields until the end of the
century.
In a statement, Profes-
sor James Stirling, Impe-
rial’s Provost, welcomed
the reporting requirement.
He said “We are com-
mitted to addressing this
imbalance by tackling
barriers to progression”,
citing personalised devel-
opment, unconscious bias
training, and outreach
work in schools, among
other projects.
Professor Stirling said:
“Our activity on gender
sits as part of our wider
equality work, now led by
Professor Stephen Curry –
our new Assistant Provost
for Equality, Diversity
and Inclusion. We are
determined to enhance
the working environment
to make Imperial a better
place to work for all our
staff.”

While Imperial has a lower gender pay gap than the Russell
Group average, and one of the lowest gaps within the Group,
men dominate the highest-paying positions. Over 70% of the
top-paying quartile of jobs at Imperial are occupied by men –
the highest of the Russell Group

Guess who's back…
And we’re back. Yes,
we know – term hasn’t
quite started yet (for those
early-birds reading this
on a Friday morning),
but we felt so sad about
being apart from our
readers we arranged to
get an issue in a week
early, just for you! Also,
let’s be real, pretty much
everyone is already back
on campus, desperately
cramming in the library,
and getting frustrated by
people leaving their stuff
on spare desks while they
go on three-hour-long
breaks. Well, there’s no
better procrastination
material than Felix (well,
maybe Sporcle), so feel
free to dive straight back
into this week’s issue!
This week our main
story is about something
that’sbeeninthenewsalot
recently: the gender pay
gap. For those of you who
haven’t been following
the news, a while ago the
government announced
their plans to have all
large companies and
public institutions publish
data on the average wage
gap between male and
female employees, with
a deadline of the end of
March/beginning of April.
Before we dive into
what happened, a quick
note: yes, the term
‘gender pay gap’can seem
misleading – it doesn’t
refer to women being paid
less than men for the same
work (although this does
still happen), but rather
the average earnings of
women compared to men.
It therefore gives you an
idea about whether or not
women are in highly-paid
positions – the fewer
women there are at the
top (or the more at the
bottom), the greater the
gap.
The results threw up
some interesting findings,
particularly within the
university sector. For the
Russell Group universi-
ties, the average gender
pay gap was nearly twice
the national average, indi-
cating top positions at uni-
versities are often filled by
men. At Imperial, the gap
was lower than the Russell
Group average – in fact, it
was one of the lowest in
the Group. But while this
is good news, it doesn’t
tell the whole story – men
were disproportionately
overrepresented at the
highest levels, occupying
over 70% of the top-pay-
ing jobs, which was the
highest rate in the Russell
Group.
While a lack of rep-
resentation is important
across all industries, it
is particularly important
in the university sector.
These data help highlights
some of the challenges
women face within
academia; we need to
look at why women aren’t
occupying the highest
positions, not merely state
the fact. People we spoke
to highlighted a number of
barriers for women – key
stages of their career tend
to coincide with the time
many people want to start
a family; the need to take
on research at sites around
the globe prevents a sense
of stability; they’re far
more likely to get negative
feedback from students
for teaching compared to
men. The list goes on.
Imperial has already
put some initiatives in
place to address these
– personalised develop-
ment, help with childcare,
selecting the widest pool
of candidates for inter-
views. These are all fan-
tastic, but the gender pay
gap results show there is a
still a long way to go. We
always hear about how
Imperial wants to be the
best at everything; here’s
one area to focus on.

What is the Gender Pay Gap?
The term ‘gender pay gap’, as used by the
UK government, is slightly misleading. The
term refers the difference in hourly pay of all
men and all women across a workforce, and
occurs when women occupy lower paying
jobs, while men occupy higher paying jobs.
The term does not refer to women being paid
less than men for the same work – although
this may happen, this is termed‘unequal pay’,
and has been illegal in the UK since 1970.
From 2017, all large employers are legally
obliged to publish the gender pay gap data
on their website, and on the government
portal. Last week it was reported that one
in ten companies still had not released their
data, despite the deadline being the 4th
April.
