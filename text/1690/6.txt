Catalonia’s new democracy – where can we
go from here?
Comment writer Aida Manzano-Kharman makes the argument that Catalonia will continue
to resist until it is given the right to vote legally on its independence.

A
rticle 1.2 of
the prelimi-
nary title of
the Spanish
Constitution states:
“National sovereignty
resides in the Spanish
people, from whom
the powers of the State
emanate.” In essence, the
distribution of power in
Spain is dictated from
the bottom upwards, in
accordance to the will of
the Spanish people. This
is a very important fact
to highlight, since many
articles of the Spanish
constitution are being
pointed out and activated,
and perhaps the most
fundamental ones – the
ones that define Spain as
a democracy – are being
overlooked by the central
government.
On the 10th
October
2017, the Catalan gov-
ernment proclaimed
and annulled its inde-
pendence, triggering
the activation of article
155 of the Spanish Con-
stitution. This article
requires the autonomous
communities of Spain to
comply with the Spanish
constitution, and allows
the government to take
any necessary measures
in order for compliance
to be ensured. In 2017,
these measures consist-
ed of Spanish vice-pres-
ident Mariano Rajoy
dissolving the Catalan
parliament and calling
for new elections; an
act that effectively left
the Catalan government
destitute
The referendum
carried out on the 1st
October was unques-
tionably illegal: aside
from the many irreg-
ularities that occurred
during voting, which
have been corroborated
by multiple delegations
of international observ-
ers, it was deemed an-
ti-constitutional mainly
because of the fact that
it was announced to be
legally binding; and
such legally binding
referendums can only
be called by the central
government.
Why then, are there
claims that the central
government is over-
looking the rights of
the Catalan people for
sel f-det erm i nat i on?
Simply put, the central
government has offered
no legal way for the
Catalan people to decide
if they want to be part of
Spain or not. The central
government is fully
aware of the independ-
ence movement that
has arisen in Cataluña.
There is a considerable
proportion of the Catalan
demographic that has
been asking to be heard
for years now, who have
been overlooked by the
central government one
too many times. Whilst
some may argue that
acknowledging this
movement would show
a sign of weakness, it is
clear that this argument
lacks critical thinking,
since this movement has
arisen from the discon-
tent of how the central
government has been
managing the country.
This discontent should
not come as a surprise,
given the multiple
corruption scandals that
have been uncovered,
or the drastic decline
in standards of public
healthcare, schools, and
services across Cata-
lonia, the reduction in
worker’s rights and pro-
tections, and overall the
very poor performance
of the Spanish economy.
If Mariano Rajoy’s
government is fully
aware that only they can
legally call a referendum
regarding the sovereign-
ty of Cataluña, and it
is also aware that there
is a sizeable portion of
the population that have
expressed their will to
be heard, how can the
Catalan government
be condemned for not
following the constitu-
tion, when the central
government is not
following democracy?
If, as the central govern-
ment claims, they truly
represent all the people
of Spain, including
the Catalans, then why
hasn’t a nation-wide
referendum been called
to ask all of Spain and
Cataluña their opinion
on this matter?
But perhaps the most
defined as public and
violent uprising for a
series of reasons, which
includes declaring
the independence of a
national territory. These
charges to leaders such
as Charles Puigdemont,
the president of the
Catalan government,
would be valid were
there any other legal
alternatives given to
holding the referendum.
However, there aren’t.
Puigdemont has a duty
to represent the Catalan
people as their elected
president, so charging
him with rebellion,
sedition, and even em-
bezzlement is the central
government’s way of
making it clear that they
do not intend on listen-
ing to or sitting down at
a negotiations table with
the Catalan government
in order to offer a viable
alternative. The charge
of embezzlement is par-
ticularly ridiculous, as
the reason of the charge
is that the Catalan
government used public
funds to finance the
referendum; because
of this they are being
accused of misuse of
funds. Does the central
government really
expect Puigdemont to
pay for the ballot boxes
and the civil servants
from his very own
pocket? Wouldn’t it be
more suitable for them
to investigate the 121,
756 million Euros that
have been stolen due to
corruption to date by the
current party in power?
Perhaps the most im-
portant question is the
following: is democracy
really democracy, if
only a few have the right
vote?

“The central
government
has offered no
legal way for
the Catalan
people to
make a choice”
shameful and damaging
outcome of this situation
is the witch-hunt that
has stemmed from it.
As people take to the
streets in Cataluña, in
frustration and anger
for having their voices
ignored over and over,
leaders of these protests
are being charged with
sedition and rebellion.
Sedition is defined in
the Spanish legal code
as the tumultuous and
public uprising to avoid
the enforcement of law.
Rebellion, in turn, is
