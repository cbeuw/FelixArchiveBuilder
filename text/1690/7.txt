P
rincess Leia was
a feminist icon
of the 1980s that
many of us grew
up with. When Carrie
Fisher passed away just
over a year ago, social
media was filled with
people mourning her
death. Two days before,
however, on Christmas
Day 2016, Vera Rubin
quietly passed away in
the USA. Rubin may not
have travelled through the
galaxy in the same way as
the Jedi Princess, but her
impact on our understand-
ing of the stars has been
profound.
In the 1970s, Rubin and
her colleague Kent Ford
at the Carnegie Institution
of Washington used an
image tube spectrograph
to observe the stars of
the Andromeda Galaxy.
They expected to see the
stars on the outer edge
of the galaxy moving
slower rate than the stars
in the centre, as would be
predicted by our known
laws of physics: think of
a siphon, or the planets
surrounding the sun in
our solar system. Instead,
they found the outer stars
were in fact moving at
the same rate as the stars
in the centre: a much
faster rate than expected.
This soon became known
as the “galaxy rotation
problem”. There were a
few theories as to why
this might have been the
case, ranging from outer
stars having different light
absorption properties, to
different orbital dynamics
unexplained by the current
mathematical equations.
But gradually, scientists
started developing a
theory that seemed to fit:
the presence of an invisi-
ble matter surrounding the
galaxy – dark matter.
Initial thoughts were
that these might be
anomalies found in just
one or two galaxies. But,
as Rubin carried on her
investigations, she found
that this phenomenon
was widespread. She
began plotting the galactic
rotation curves of a large
number of galaxies, as
well as collecting data
on the orbital velocities
of stars from the galaxy
centres to their outer
edges. Her findings
showed clearly that the
unexplained speed of the
outer stars was typical
of most galaxies in the
universe. The dark matter
hypothesis seemed to
explain these findings
– Rubin had indirectly
found the first observa-
tional evidence for dark
matter, an invisible matter
found throughout our
universe, which does not
interact with light or our
known electromagnetic
spectrum.
Dark matter is current-
ly thought to make up
somewhere around 84%
of the total matter in the
universe. However, our
knowledge is limited
on what dark matter is,
the type of particles it
is comprised of, and its
relationship with dark
energy (also now thought
to constitute much of
the universe). Increasing
evidence for dark matter
is building upon Rubin’s
discoveries, such as the
light distortion of distant
galaxies into arcs when
their light passes through
a gravitational lens caused
by the unseen matter.
Vera Rubin made her
career in astronomy at a
time when gender discrim-
ination was rife. In 1948,
she was turned down from
a graduate programme
at Princeton University
based on her gender, and
many believe she was
unfairly not awarded the
Nobel Prize for her work
due to sexism. Despite
these setbacks, she went
on to become a real
inspiration and advocate
for numerous women in
physics.
E
-cigarettes, often
advertised as an
aid for smoking
cessation, may
actually encourage young
adults to take up smoking,
new research suggests.
E-cigarettes are
growing in popularity,
both in the US and
UK, with vaping shops
opening on every other
street corner. E-cigarettes
provide the same smoking
experience as traditional
cigarettes, but with fewer
toxins. First introduced
in the US in 2007, it was
hoped they would help
many of the country’s
40 million smokers
quit. However, they
have become clouded in
controversy, as scientists
haven’t been able to de-
termine their benefits and
drawbacks when used on
a large scale.
The new research,
conducted by the Norris
Cotton Cancer Centre in
America’s Dartmouth
University, alongside
many other partners,
uses the most up-to-date
evidence to quantify the
scientific grounding of the
benefits and drawbacks of
large scale e-cigarette use.
The scientists found
that, based on 2014
data, e-cigarettes did
more harm than good
on the whole population
level. Dr. Samir Soneji,
the study’s principal
investigator from the
Dartmouth Institute for
Health Policy and Clinical
Practice said: “Although
the tobacco industry
markets e-cigarettes as a
tool to help adult smokers
quit smoking [they] only
marginally increase the
number of adult cigarette
smokers who are able
to successfully quit”.
He added: “E-cigarettes
may facilitate cigarette
smoking initiation and
confer substantial harm
to adolescents and young
adults once they are intro-
duced to nicotine.”
Researchers used
census counts, national
health tobacco-use
surveys, and published lit-
erature to create a model
estimating the number of
years of life expectancy
lost by adolescents who
had never smoked, and
who used e-cigarettes
before eventually
becoming daily cigarette
smokers by the age of
around 35-39. The scien-
tists specifically compared
the additional number of
people who quit thanks
to e-cigarettes against
those who quit without,
with successful quitting
defined as constant absti-
nence for seven years.
The current 2014 data
show that 3,490,000
current smokers used
e-cigarettes to quit, whilst
3,640,000 young adults
started using e-cigarettes
despite previously not
smoking. The model esti-
mated that, in 2015, an ad-
ditional 2,070 individuals
would quit smoking using
e-cigarettes compared
to those who did not use
them. In contrast, it pre-
dicted that 168,000 young
adults who did not smoke
in 2014 would begin
smoking by the next year,
eventually becoming full-
time smokers by the age of
35 compared to those who
never used e-cigarettes.
Alarmingly, the model
also estimated that e-ciga-
rette usage in 2014 caused
about 1.5 million years
of life to be lost by ado-
lescents who had never
before smoked.
The researchers warn
that more needs to be
done on a national and
local scale to make e-cig-
arette beneficial on the
large scale. Soneji argued:
“E-cigarettes will likely
cause more public health
harm…unless ways can
be found to substantially
decrease the number of
adolescents and young
adults who vape and
increase the number of
smokers who use e-ciga-
rettes to successfully quit
smoking”
