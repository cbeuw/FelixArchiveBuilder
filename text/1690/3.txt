Imperial College
Union have launched
a survey asking
respondents give their
opinionontheethicsof
different investments
proposed.

T
he survey,
l a u n c h e d
online, has
allowed re-
spondents to voice their
opinion on whether the
Union should invest in
industries considered
ethically problematic
such as pornography,
fossil fuels, and the
armament sector. The
Union will invest its
reserves and part of the
Clubs, Societies and
Projects funding ac-
count, stating the money
would only lose in value
if left untouched, due to
inflation.
The responses have
been taken into consid-
eration by the Union’s

Imperial computing professor detained in Iran
who is based at Imperial’s
Department of Comput-
ing, was arrested by Iran’s
Revolutionary Guards on
the 15th April, according
to a human rights group.
The Centre for Human
Rights in Iran (CHRI),
a US-based non-profit,
reported Professor Edalat
refused to post bail this
Wednesday, leading to
him being taken into
custody. A source told the
CGHI Professor Edalat’s
home was raided, and his
belongings seized.
The Foreign Office
this week stated they
were “urgently seeking
information from the
Iranian authorities” about
Professor Edalat.
In a statement, the
College said: "We are
understandably concerned
for his welfare following
reports of his arrest, and
we are urgently seeking
further information."
Professor Edalat is
believed to have been in
Iran to attend an academic
workshop.
As well as his academic
career, Professor Edalat is
the founder of the Cam-
paign Against Sanctions
and Military Intervention
in Iran (CASMII), which
campaigns against foreign
interventions in Iran. He
previously told Times
Higher Education he
would not be submit-
ting research papers to
US-based conferences
in protest to President
Donald Trump’s restric-
tions on vias.
Professor Edalat is one
of a number of high-pro-
file arrests of Iranian dual
nationals. Since 2015, the
Revolutionary Guards
have arrested 30 dual
nationals; the majority
have been accused of
espionage.
Earlier this year Dr
Kaveh Madani, a Reader
at Imperial’s Centre for
Environmental Policy,
was detained for 72 hours
in Iran. Dr Madani had
been made Deputy Head
of Iran’s Department of
Environment last year, a
position from which he
resigned last week.
Hadi Ghaemi, execu-
tive director of the CHRI,
said of the arrest: “Iran’s
continued arbitrary
arrests of dual nationals
without transparency and
lack of due process is ex-
tremely concerning.” The
International Observatory
of Human Rights accused
the Iranian government
of using dual-nationals
as “bargaining chips in
Tehran’s ongoing negoti-
ations with the West.”
Committee, who will be
discussing the potential
ethical dilemmas, as well
as the risks and returns
that each option brings.
Matt Blackett, Deputy
President (Finance & Ser-
vices) told Felix: “A staff
and student panel met all
of the shortlisted fund
managers on Tuesday
and, guided by student
input throughout, they
have reached a decision.
Once the paperwork is
done, we look forward to
telling our members how
we’re putting our reserves
to work so we can fund
even more activities and
events”.
In a statement, Divest
Imperial – a student-run
campaign pressuring the
Union and College to
withdraw investments
from fossil fuels – has
accused the survey
of being misleading,
factually incorrect, and
undermining student
campaigning and democ-
racy. They stated: “The
survey directly equates
the exclusion of fossil
fuels, armaments, alcohol,
gambling, pornography
and tobacco from a port-
folio with a ‘severe risk’,
which is misleading and
clearly lends itself to bias.
There was also no attempt
to explain the arguments,
including financial,
in favour of moving
investments away from
fossil fuels, potentially
undermining the Union’s
existing commitments to
divestment and support
for the campaign. Al-
though we expressed our
concerns to the DPFS
directly following the
survey launch, we are yet
to receive a response. We
hope the Union will fulfil
its original resolution to
fully divest from fossil
fuels, communicate more
effectively with students
in future, and work with
us in holding university
management to account
on this issue”.
Last year the Union
made the commitment to
no longer invest in fossil
fuel and to implement
alternative responsible
investment strategies. The
Council paper implement-
ing the decision, brought
forward by Rhidian
Thomas (Ethics & En-
vironment Officer) and
supported by the Divest
Imperial campaign, has
estimated that the college
directly invested £5.4
million in fossil fuel
companies with further
investments been made
by externally managed
funds. It was believed that
Imperial was one of the
top investors among UK
universities.
The paper also high-
lighted that the increase in
global temperatures is due
largely to burning of fossil
fuels, that some of these
companies have been im-
plicated in cases of human
rights abuses, and their
overall image did not fit in
with the Union’s values.
Imperial College
London has been found to
be one of the least ethical
investors within higher
education in the People
and Planet University
league table, ranking at
the 141st
place – the lowest
amongst the Russell
Group. An investigation
by Felix earlier this year
showed the College was
investing £3.5 million
in the tobacco industry,
nearly £9 million in the
fossil fuel industry, £3.1
million in the arms indus-
try, and over £16 million
in pharmaceuticals, out of
a total fund of over £266
million.
Companies that
received investment
from the College, such
as Exxon and Shell, have
been accused of burying
evidence of global
warming and committing
crimes against humanity.
One academic told
Felix: “The world looks
to us to set the agenda
of research; how can we
lead from the front when
our eyes are still squarely
focused on the past and its
former cash cows – fossil
fuels”.

UCU call off further strike action, as debates around
tuition fee refunds continue
NEWS
Strike action has
been called off as
UCU and UUK reach
agreement, but
pressure is mounting
for fee refunds.

M
embers of
the Uni-
versity and
C o l l e g e
Union (UCU) earlier
this month voted to
accept proposals from
Universities UK (UUK),
cancelling strike action
scheduled for later this
term.
In a ballot, whose
results were revealed on
the 13th
April, 64% of
members voted to accept
the pensions offer from
UUK, with 36% voting
to reject the offer. Overall
turnout from members
was 63.5%.
The proposal put
forward by UUK, the
regulator of universities
in the UK, included main-
tenance of the current
pension scheme until at
least April 2019, contin-
ued discussion between
parties, and establishment
of a Joint Expert Panel.
The Panel, which would
be composed of academ-
ics and actuarial experts,
would report on valuation
of the current pension
scheme.
The agreement came
shortly after 14 days of
industrial action by UCU
members came to an end.
The strikes were called
over changes to the Uni-
versities Superannuation
Scheme (USS), which
UCU said would mean
members of the scheme
would lose out on £10,000
per year in pension
funds. As a result of the
action, students across 65
universities lost out on
scheduled teaching time.
At Imperial, students
have been assured they
will not be examined on
missed content, with the
College saying they were
“committed to putting
measures in place that
will safeguard [students’]
ability to progress or
graduate.”
UCU had originally
planned a further 14 days
of strike action, timed to
coincide with the exam-
ination period of many
universities. This has been
postponed following the
agreement.
The development was
welcomed by the College,
with Professor Alice Gast,
President, and Professor
James Stirling, Provost,
telling staff it was “a
welcome step forward,
and in line with our call
in February to convene an
expert group.”
Roddy Slorach, Impe-
rial College UCU’s Di-
versity Officer, told Felix
“The UUK offer removed
the immediate threat of
the drastic change to our
pensions, although it
provided few other guar-
antees. A large majority of
UCU members voted Yes
in the hope the Independ-
ent Expert Panel could
sort out the valuation and
reduce the ‘deficit’”
However, he cautioned
the vote was “absolutely
not a vote of confidence in
UUK”, saying if the panel
recommended pension
cuts, another ballot on
further industrial action
would need to be called.
He highlighted the rela-
tionthesestrikeshavewith
general developments in
higher education: “It’s
important to recognise the
broader issues that have
driven this dispute. The
attacks on our pensions
can be traced back to the
creation of tuition fees
and a market in education.
Since then, universities
have increasingly seen
themselves as competi-
tors, with students seen
as customers and staff as
costs to be cut.”
Dr Michael McGarvey,
President of Imperial
College UCU, told Felix
UCU membership at
Imperial had increased
by 60% over the dispute
period. "Management
should be under no
illusion that this decision
is a sign of weakness,"
he said, "We expect the
university employers at
Imperial and throughout
the UK to act in good
faith. However, if there
is no acceptable outcome
from the Panel then UCU
can resume strike action."
Fee Refunds
While an agreement
has been reached between
UUK and UCU, disagree-
ments about whether or
not to refund tuition fees
to students affected by last
term’s strikes are ongoing.
A petition that circu-
lated at the end of last
terms asking for a refund
of tuition fees in light
of missed teaching was
signed by over 3,000
Imperial students. It was
delivered to senior man-
agement at the College,
who have thus far refused
to confirm whether they
will be refunding fees.
A statement on the
College website, which
was also sent out to several
students by Professor
Gast, says: “your fees
cover all aspects of your
time at Imperial, and are
based on the delivery of
overall outcomes, rather
than being payments for
specific contact hours.
Through our mitigation
plans, we are aiming to
ensure the impact of the
strike on these outcomes
is kept to a minimum.”
Some students have
felt the response is insuf-
ficient. One postgraduate
student told Felix: " We
education suffered".
In a statement released
on social media earlier
this week, Alex Chippy
Compton, President of Im-
perial College Union, and
Luke McCrone, President
of the Graduate Students’
Union, said the response
from senior management
was “unsatisfactory, and
failed to address many
students’ concerns.” They
called on students to
continue to pressure the
College for refunds on
any teaching missed and
not rescheduled.
Speaking to Felix,
Compton said “We’re
glad to see that collective
action by UCU members
has resulted in fresh dis-
cussions about the future
of their pensions. Current
students will be glad to
see the end of the strikes
that interrupted their edu-
cation, and future students
are less likely to be taught
by demoralised, precar-
iously-employed aca-
demics. Imperial College
Union will continue to
press College to make it
up to students who missed
out on the education they
paid for.”
Other universities have
also seen demands for
refunds of tuition fees.
Earlier this week a class
action lawsuit organised
by law firm Asserson
passed a legal milestone,
with more than 1,000
students signing up. The
group claim now has
enough people to qualify
for a group litigation
order. Asserson predict
it could cost universities
millions in compensation.
Shimon Goldwater, a
senior solicitor at Asser-
son, told Times Higher
Education: “No other
service provider would
get away with charging
for 25 weeks of a service
and cutting that to 22 with
no price reduction.”

To be told that 14 days

because the management

value on my education as
