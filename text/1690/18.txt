nnovation Forum
Imperial College
London (IFICL) is a
student society – part
of a non-profit global
organisation, with more
than 10,000 members in
over nine countries – that
seeks to build bridges
between academia, indus-
try, and policy makers.
We focus on the future
and evolution of today’s
technologies, ranging
from the nascent stage to
the cusp of commercial
application.
Innovation is a multi-
disciplinary activity that
is key to any country’s
growth model. It brings
together engineers,
business professionals,
economists, doctors, sci-
entists, and policy makers.
The Innovation Forum
exists to facilitate this
multidisciplinary struc-
ture by fostering synergy
between academia,
industry, and the public
sector.
On the 9th
May 2018,
we are hosting an event at
Imperial’s South Kensing-
ton campus – “Healthcare
through a Digital Eye”.
The event aims to host
200 attendees, including
students, academics,
industry professionals,
and entrepreneurs, and
increase public knowledge
about digital healthcare.
Our goal is to provide
insights to anyone who
is keen to get on board
on digital healthcare,
from various perspectives
provided by the policy
makers, corporates, start-
ups, academia, investors
or accelerators, focusing
on future and evolution of
digital healthcare.
Speakers from a range
of backgrounds will be
attending the conference,
including:

20 years’ experience as

on supporting, connecting

health eco-system – from

collaborate. He also works
with stakeholders looking
to commercialise their
