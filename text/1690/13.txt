Children of Blood and Bone takes a step forward for
representation, but is stuck in YA romance
Tomi Adeyemi’s host of characters could inspire a generation of under-represented teens, but hopefully their
relationships won’t have such an impact.
Y
oung Adult
books can get
a lot of bad
rap. In some
ways, I can see why, but
then releases like Tomi
Adeyemi’s debut Children
of Blood and Bone make
me question the stigma.
Zélie should have
magical abilities, but a
ruthless king destroyed
magic and killed anyone
with powers before she
could develop them.
When an ancient artefact
is found which seems to
be reconnecting diviners
with the gods, igniting
their abilities, Zélie has
a chance to improve the
lives of her people.
It’s not the most
unique take on magic or
the ‘Chosen One’ trope,
but that’s not the appeal.
Adeyemi’s rich world is
inspired by West African
mythology, with some
modern politics thrown
in. It’s a vivid representa-
tion of a land and its
culture which can be both
beautiful and cruel. It
would often force me into
moments of contempla-
tion, either in admiration
or sombre silence. The
atrocities committed
against the diviners are
hard enough on the reader,
let alone when considered
in the context of the Black
Lives Matter movement.
In the Author’s Note at
the end of the book, par-
allels are drawn between
real people and characters
of the book – children,
mothers, and innocents.
It drags the reader back
into a harsh reality; all the
emotions felt throughout
the novel are forced onto
stories you’ve seen on the
news.
“The book
would often
force me into
moments of
contemplation
or sombre
silence”
“Why do all
YA books
need the
protagonist
to fall in love?
And why
are the love
interests so
terrible?”
Still, it’s not all about
sorrow. Adeyemi has
discussed her desire give
a young readership pro-
tagonists in whom they
could see themselves,
something she had never
found for herself. On
the author’s YouTube
channel, there is a video
of her holding the book in
her hands for the first time
which shows her passion.
Through her tears, you
can see how important it
is to her, and it will be to
countless others.
Children of Blood and
Bone is drawing lots of
attention. It may not have
exploded in the media as
Black Panther did, but
both stories are starting
many a discussion. It has
held its place on the New
York Times bestsellers list
for the last six weeks. A
deal for not one but three
films was announced
before the book was even
released. Pretty impres-
sive for a 24-year-old
debut author.
If it wasn’t branded YA,
and if the cast wasn’t filled
with teens, it may have
been even more popular.
But it doesn’t seem to
be the age of the target
audience that makes many
recoil – you don’t see
anyone shying away from
Harry Potter for being a
kid’s book. The problem
is much more specific to
YA itself. Many people
are put off by a reputation
of re-hashed plots, clichéd
writing, and the same
bland girls falling for bad
boys.
Sadly, not all of those
problems are resolved by
Adeyemi.
Her writing style isn’t
necessarily one to sing
about. It’s easy to read,
which isn’t a bad thing
– there isn’t an elaborate
style which could disori-
entate or distract from the
plot. Anyone could read
it, and that’s good – this
book should reach as
many people as possible.
What did irk me about
the writing was the inces-
sant use of interruption. So
many times, the narrator
would be cut short mid
wor–
“Only for their train of
thought to be completed,”
by another character.
Sure, it’s fine once, but
it’s annoying as soon as it
becomes noticeable. This
forced effort to be quirky
is found too often in books
of this kind.
It’s annoying, but at
least it’s not problemat-
ic, unlike the romance
shoehorned into Children
of Blood and Bone, and
many other YA books.
Why do they all need the
protagonist to fall in love?
And why are the love
interests so often terrible
people?
It’s happened ever
since Twilight popularised
YA books – maybe that’s
what started the trend of
unhealthy relationships.
In this case, Adeyemi tries
to convince the reader that
a villain is good boyfriend
material. Some of his acts
are justified, and he has a
little hero in him, but who
wants to be with someone
they’ve seen commit
murder and arson?
For a book with a young
target audience, it is not
appropriate. It’s not even
required for the story; the
same outcome could be
reached with friendship
instead of romance.
This isn’t the only
offence, but it is the worst.
At least the other relation-
ship that’s toyed with is
between two good, whole-
some characters. Still, for
a book focussing on four
teenagers, it’s a little too
neat to have two couples.
I’m thankful there isn’t a
love triangle.
Children of Blood and
Bone deserves all the
hype it’s receiving and
more, but it’s by no means
perfect. The diversity that
it brings to YA should be
celebrated, its legacy con-
tinued. The dysfunctional
relationships between the
characters should not.
