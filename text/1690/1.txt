Russell Group gender pay gap nearly twice
national average

While Imperial has
one of the lowest
gaps in the Russell
Group, men dominate
the highest-paid
positions.

ata released
last month
show the Rus-
sell Group has
a gender pay gap nearly
twice that of the national
average.
Across the 24 universi-
ties making up the Russell
Group, the median gender
pay gap was 16.7%,
slightly larger than the
average for higher educa-
tion institutions (HEIs) as
a whole, and significantly
higher than the national
average of 9.7%.
While Imperial has one
of the lowest pay gaps
in the Russell Group,
with women earning on
average 9.4% less per
hour than male staff, men
dominate the highest
paid positions. Male staff
occupy over 70% of the
highest-paying quartile
of jobs – the highest
proportion in the entire
Russell Group – and 56%
of the second highest-pay-
ing quartile. Professor
James Stirling, Imperial’s
Provost, said the statistics
were not acceptable.
On average, men
occupy just over 60% of
the highest-paying quar-
tile of jobs in all Russell
Group universities.
Women occupy over 60%
of the lowest-paying quar-
tile of jobs in the group.
Furthermore, men were
found to be slightly more
likely to be granted bonus
pay, which was over 40%
higher than that awarded
to women.
At Imperial, men were
paid bonuses 50% larger
on average than women.
The College say this
gap is because “we have
fewer women in senior
positions, and bonus pay-
ments are proportionate to
individuals’ salaries.”
These data come after
the government mandated
all companies and public
bodies that employ more
than 250 people to release
information on their pay
gap.
The Russell Group
university with the
highest gender pay gap
is Durham University,
which reported a median
gap of nearly 30%. Pro-
fessor Stuart Corbridge,
the vice-chancellor of
Durham, said “We recog-
nise that the gender pay
gap is a serious issue for
Durham University, as it
is for society as a whole
and the higher education
sector in particular.” The
university has outlined a
series of moves to address
the gap, including pay
review policies.
The data released by
Russell Group universities
highlights the difficulties
women have in attaining
the highest-ranking roles
within HEIs – a factor
that is one of the key
causes of the gender pay
gap. For all universities
within the Russell Group,
the proportion of women
decrease further up the
pay scale.
While overall Imperial
employs more men than
women – with 44% of all
