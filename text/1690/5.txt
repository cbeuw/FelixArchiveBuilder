It’s time to be online honestly
The ICSMSU campaign to get more people to share their true feelings online highlighted the
powerful effects social media can have on wellbeing.
COMMENT

ICSMSU Welfare Officer
I
n a modern world,
our interactions with
one another are often
shaped by the explo-
sive and revolutionary
impact of social media.
For most of us, Facebook,
Instagram, Snapchat, and
Twitter can be a pleasant
escape – a way to keep in
contact with our friends,
or share fond memories of
good times in good places.
But there is a darker side
of social media which is
beginning to emerge. And
it deserves more attention.
The backlash from
the Cambridge Analyt-
ica scandal provides a
stark warning to those
of us who share our
information online – we
cannot be certain who
is accessing it, or how
we are being targeted
through what we share.
Meanwhile, a look
back on the 2016 U.S.
Presidential Election
and the eruption of
‘FAKE NEWS’ demon-
strates that external
interference with social
media platforms has
the potential to literally
change the direction
of an entire country.
In March, ICSMSU
Welfare’s Campaigns
Team decided to tackle
another issue with social
media: the effect it is
having on the mental
health of young people.
Undoubtedly, social
media can have a
harmful effect on our
self-esteem and well-
being. Designed in a
manner which mimics
the process of addiction
– both psychologically
and physiologically –
social media keeps us
constantly refreshing for
new content; receiving a
‘like’ can act as a form
of social validation – a
validation to which we
aspire whenever we
post. In doing so, we
all too often filter out
the imperfections in our
lives, only sharing the
positives while neglect-
ing to mention our daily
struggles, failures, or
worries.
This creates a harmful
cycle, whereby we
constantly compare
ourselves to the perfect
projections we witness
online; we think we
cannot be honest about
our difficulties because
that is not something
worthy of ‘likes’. As
such, we create an en-
vironment where only
success and perfection is
talked about. ICSMSU
Welfare sought to tackle
this by encouraging
students to not just be
online, but #Online-
Honestly.
For two weeks in
March, we asked people
to repost old pictures
from social media
unedited and unfiltered,
with a new caption
honest to the situation
they were actually
facing. By the fifth day,
we were overwhelmed
by the level of engage-
ment and support from
students, not just in
ICSM, but across all of
our Constituent Unions
and even from students
as far away as LSE and
Manchester. A senior
member of Faculty even
decided participate by
making a post as part of
the campaign – resulting
in a flurry of posts,
totalling 80 across all
of social media by the
close of the campaign.
When we planned
it, we didn’t dream of
the School of Medicine
embracing it with such
warmth so quickly,
nor did we anticipate
how brave so many
of students would be
to share their deeply
personal reflections on
previous social media
posts and how many of
them would relate to
the message behind the
campaign.
Whilst this campaign
is over for now, we hope
all of Imperial recog-
nises every one of us
is more than our online
image. We all have our
unique problems and
challenges we face every
day. We don’t always
present that image
of ourselves online
because we think we’re
alone: this campaign has
proved that we are not.
Let’s all go that extra
mile to ask our friends
how they’re doing. Let’s
be more willing to open
up and start a dialogue
about the issues some
of us are struggling with
day to day. Let’s make it
okay to be honest with
ourselves and our peers
about the challenges we
face.
The Online Honestly
campaign has shown
we have a deeply com-
passionate community
at Imperial. I am very
proud to be a part of
it, and you should be
too. Social media can
enhance our lives, but we
can’t let it take over. Our
online image is exactly
that: an image. A funny
or witty caption might
be masking an intense
personal struggle, but
we all have our unique
issues. We shouldn’t be
afraid to be honest about
them.
If you saw the Online
Honestly campaign or
were affected by any
of the posts and are
looking for support,
please reach out to
your Personal Tutor, the
Union Advice Centre, or
contact your Wellbeing
Representative for other
useful support services.

I
t’s exam season
again. I hope you’re
all excited for the
downs that accom-
pany it. At the moment,
the main stress for me
does not come from
exams, but from the fact
that as of Monday we
have welcomed a new
scaly skinned overlord
into our midst. Nearly
1500 years after a lizard
was slain on the 23rd
of April by St. George
Michael, the scaly bas-
tards have been waiting
to reclaim the date for
their own kind. As soon
as the human baby was
plucked from Kate
Middleton’s uterus, the
newly formed foetus
was devoured and its
skin used for the latest
addition to the Royal
Brood.
In a lighter vein, this
week around 30,000
idiots decided to test their
physical endurance - and
the NHS - by running the
London Marathon.
I’m unsure if you’re
aware of the original fable
that spawned the sporting
event known as the
marathon, but it involved
a lot of Persians being
slaughtered on a beach
by significantly fewer
Greeks. and then some
Athenian runner named
Pheidippides jogged back
to Athens to proclaim
victory. Unfortunately
for this particular herald,
he was so overcome on
arrival that his heart burst
in his chest, dying just
after climatically deliver-
ing his message.
A part of me wished
he never ran the 26 miles
to so the marathon didn’t
exist. A larger part of me
wishes that all those that
ran the London Marathon
actually have a similar-
ly-important task, rather
than simply wanting to
brag about their achieve-
ments to the rest of us.
If I’m perfectly honest,
I don’t understand the
point of the exercise.
People that run purport
to do it for two reasons,
the first being fitness,
and the second being the
moralistic goal of raising
money for charity. I resent
the first reason mostly
because I believe it con-
tributes to the superficial
nature of our society, but
also because running is so
fucking boring. At least
do a sport that you can
do with other people and
involves more than mean-
inglessly putting one foot
in front of the other like a
toddler learning to walk.
As for the second
excuse, I’m just as likely
to donate to charity for
someone running 26+
miles as I am to someone
not doing any running at
all – just ask the shits in
the RSPCA. Essentially,
it’s just yet another way
of people proving their
innate superiority over the
rest of us mere mortals
incapable of performing
the same feat without
mechanical assistance, or
severe alcoholism.
I wish that they would
go the extra mile and
remove this irritating
hobby from my sight.
