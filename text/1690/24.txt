place.

T

D o d g e b a l l
League con-
cluded this
weekend with Imperial
Wolverines 1s retaining
the University League
South title. Wolverines
1s managed to finish the
season unbeaten. They
overpowered everyone
along the way, including:
Hertfordshire A with their
Dodgeball World Cup fi-
nalist import; UCL Pumas
with their stretching of the
rules both on and off the
court; and UEA Falcons
1s with their microscopic
player who is literally
impossible to hit. Imperial
now venture to Leicester
next month to compete
at the University League
Finals, a final showdown
of every regional league
winner to competing to be
dodgeball’s Crème de la
Crème.
Until Sunday, the
League still had not been
fully decided. A poor
Imperial effort could have
allowed HertfordshireAto
snatch the league victory,
regardless of Imperial’s
two victories over them
already. Wolverines 1s
versus UCL Pumas would
prove a pivotal game in
the ultimate league result.
Bidding for third place,
UCL needed this win just
as much as the league
leaders did.
The fixture began, and
Imperial were quick to
assert their dominance
over the initial sets.
UCL were very keen to
pressure Steve Ndumbe
into the corner, but quick
counter attacks from
Nithin Thoppuram helped
equalise any deficits. A
quick dominance turned
into a hard slog of having
to earn every point to the
bitter end. The scoreboard
read 8-4 to Imperial just
before the last set of the
first half. Both teams gave
everything and with only
ten seconds remaining,
UCL found themselves a
player up after some fero-
cious throwing. However,
a magical short distance
catch by Lochlann Allison
that forced him to the
floor just before the blow
of the whistle turned
what would have been a
nerve-wrecking 8-6 half
time score into a slightly
more comfortable 10-4
lead.
However, UCL was far
from done, and after the
teams traded games in the
second half, a chaotic set
with a number of question-
able ref calls, including a
catch by next year’s club
captain Leo Haigh that
was not acknowledged,
saw our rivals reduce the
lead to 12-8. At this point
Imperial stepped up their
game and employed the
tactic they are best at –
systematic and organised
play, aimed at maximising
the time each set lasts,
slowly (in the case of
UCL rather quickly) infu-
riating the opponent and
forcing them to make silly
mistakes.
Getting the last
Wolverine off the court
proved to be an insur-
mountable obstacle for
the UCL team and with a
series of catch-and-outs
by Vinolan Arulananthan,
Filip Sebest, and George
Fish, only three more
games were played in the
second half, two of which
went to Imperial for a
final score of 16-10. This
match secured the league
victory for the Imperial 1s
regardless of the last game
against UEA 1s, which
for completion ended in
favour of Imperial with
the score of 19-5. UCL
were destined for 4th
place
as a consequence.
However, it wasn’t just
the 1s celebrating – our
2s had a very successful
season too, finishing 2nd
out of all second teams,
with a strong last weekend
epitomised by MVP Yan
Jin and her remarkable
catching. Nonetheless, it
wasn’tallplainsailing,and
they had their fair share of
adversity to overcome: an
absent captain, a player
with literally no concept
of time, and a yogurt with
ridiculous on-court antics.
The final match of the
league between Imperial
2s and Southampton
2s was to decide who
would take the 2nd
place
amongst all the second
teams. Intelligent calling
and powerful throwing by
Nifemi Adejumobi saw
the 2s take an early 7-1
lead. The Southampton
team would have none of
that and with a couple of
organised games target-
ing our wingmen, they
quickly caught up to 7-5
and had hope at half time.
Luckily, the second
half was more convincing
from our 2s, with an
eye-catching diving dodge
by Mink Radtanajiravong,
a pirouette dodge by Jinay
Patel, and multiple catches
coming from Yan Jin and
James Mellor-Rice. Great
team effort saw the 2s
pull out an overall 17-9
victory over a spirited and
friendly Southampton 2nd
team.
The excitement is not
just contained to the court
however, with AGM
promises of a tour, extra
socials, and Hugo Boss
kit, next year is shaping to
be another great year for
Imperial Dodgeball, as we
seek to maintain the title
and establish our inaugu-
ral women’s team. So if
you want to get involved
in our competitive mixed
teams next year, or want
to join one of our many
social members, look
out for the Wolverine
sign at Fresher’s Fair.
And remember: Throw
Together, Dodge Alone.
