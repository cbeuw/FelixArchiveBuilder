Picasso 1932: the man’s pivotal year in paintings
H
ow do you
measure a year?
In paintings, of
course – at least
for Picasso. 1932 was a
pivotal year for Picasso
in more ways than one.
By this point in time he
was a celebrated artist,
but critics were beginning
to speak of him in the
past tense, rather than as
a visionary of the future.
Feeling increasingly
restless, he had bought an
18th
century mansion in
the Norman countryside
where he experimented
with sculpture. He was
also in a clandestine
relationship with a twen-
ty-two year old woman,
while his marriage fell
apart behind a sheen of
bourgeois respectability.
While all this was going
on, he was getting ready
for his first major retro-
spective in June.
Tate Modern’s ex-
hibition Picasso 1932
measures this colourful
year against the works he
produced, providing us a
glimpse into the various
events that shaped the
artist’s life in that year,
and his responses to them.
It is a detailed visual diary
of how Picasso thought
and felt during the year.
Although it is unusual for
an entire exhibition to be
dedicated to the paintings
done in a single year by
one man, the tight narra-
tive that the boundaries
of a year necessitates
makes the show more
interesting. The stories
that link the paintings of
this year together become
more personal, and we get
a more intimate picture of
who the man was.
The exhibition is
arranged chronologically,
displaying works as they
were made through the
year. In January, with his
impending retrospective
in mind, Picasso produced
a series of portrait paint-
ings. These are all of a
female figure seated in
an armchair, reading,
sleeping, or in apparent
bliss after sex. Across
these paintings and across
the other works in the
show, it is interesting to
note his variations across
themes – with the same
female subject, Picasso
moves from saturated
colour harmonies to
abstract linework, ex-
ploring emotions from
the hysteria and pain in
Beauty and Terror to the
peaceful serenity of Rest.
The inspiration for
most of these figures was
Marie-Therese Walter,
his twenty-two year old
mistress.Agood swimmer
with an athletic figure, she
would be a significant
part of Picasso’s life that
year, serving as his muse
and model and injecting
a new sensuality to his
figures. In his chateau in
Normandy, Picasso exper-
imented with sculpture,
transforming Walter’s
strong features into solid
volumes and bulbous
shapes. These sculptures
were captured for the
first time and published at
the end of 1932, and are
shown here. Displayed
next to his paintings, we
can see the clear rela-
tionship between the two
media, reflecting each
other in their curves and
strong lines.
In March, Picasso
painted a group of large
canvases that experiment-
ed with rich colours and
compositions. Girl Before
a Mirror, for example,
stands out for its use of
strong, black lines and
riotous colours, giving
a sense that the painting
can hardly contain the
energy within. During this
time, Picasso also flirted
with surrealism, painting
a series of horizontal
images that looked like
a nude or an octopus in
varying degrees, depend-
ing on the perspective.
Perhaps the most preoc-
cupying event on the year
was Picasso’s retrospec-
tive in June, for which
he had rejected offers
from major galleries and
festivals including The
Museum of Modern Art
and the Venice Biennale.
He insisted on curating
his own show, and chose
to mix up works from dif-
ferent periods in a dense
hang, without providing
the dates of individual
works. While the frequent
appearance of Walter’s
features suggested to the
public that a new woman
had entered Picasso’s life,
there was also a group of
paintings of his family that
was displayed prominent-
ly in the show. Interesting-
ly, these paintings were
from his Blue period in
the early 1900s, and were
markedly different from
this more contemporary,
vibrant work, which also
suggested their datedness.
After his retrospective,
Picasso continued to
experiment, painting a
series of Reclining Nudes
that explored the perspec-
tives one can take with a
body. He painted both the
front and back on a nude
on the same plane, fully
expressing the curves of
both breasts and buttocks.
These variations, like
the octopus-nudes and
the women in armchairs,
reinforce the experimen-
tal nature of Picasso’s
paintings in this time, as
each painting in the series
pushes more boundaries
in perspective, colours
and representation.
It is incredible to see
what can be produced
in the space of one year,
and this exhibition allows
us to see the patterns in
his paintings that recur
throughout the year, as
well as the incremental
pushing of boundaries
and the limits of how far
a particular theme or com-
position can go. It offers
a meaningful story that
brings us through one of
the most significant years
in Picasso’s life – a story
that is entertaining and en-
lightening, and definitely
worth a visit.
The Tate Modern take us through one of the most important years of Picasso’s life, examining how he reacted to
the world around him through his work.

PICASSO 1932
The Inheritance: the new Angels in America?
E
.M. Forster’s
1910 novel
Howard’s End
is a tale of
Dickensian proportions
about the dangers of
materialism, and the
importance of the re-
sponsibilities we owe
each other. In it, the
altruistic Schlegel siblings
clash with the wealthy
Wilcoxes: properties are
bequeathed in secret;
orphans become heirs;
misjudged moments of
violence and others of
well-intentioned kindness
lead to tragedy; the for-
merly miserly, selfish, and
cruel see the error of their
ways. It is a quintessential
turn-of-the-century romp,
but it holds a kernel of
universality that has
rung true decades after
its initial publication,
leading to numerous
screen and stage adapta-
tions. Of these the 1989
film adaptation starring
Emma Thompson remains
the most acclaimed. It
was this production that
playwright Matthew
Lopez saw as a teen: he
was transfixed. The novel
would go on to have a
profound effect on the
young Lopez – a young
gay man growing up in
the small town, to whom
it seemed E.M. Forster,
himself closeted, was a
directly speaking.
His new play, The
Inheritance, is Lopez’
homage to the novel and
the author who meant so
much to him growing up.
In this sprawling two part
work that cumulatively is
more than six hours long,
Lopez reimagines the
characters of Howard’s
End as gay men living in
contemporary New York.
The eldest Schlegel sister
becomes Eric Glass (Kyle
Soller), a kind-hearted
and thoughtful lawyer
who is soon to be evicted
from the only home he’s
ever known; his ambitious
and insecure boyfriend is
Toby (Andrew Burnap)
who is writing a play.
Their chance encounter
with Adam (Samuel H
Levine), a charismatic
young actor who upturns
their lives, eventually
leads Eric and Toby to
part ways. When this rela-
tionship implodes, Eric is
drawn to the wealthy real
estate developer Henry
Wilcox (John Benjamin
Hickey) whose partner
of many decades, Walter
(Paul Hilton) has just
died. Henry and Eric’s
burgeoning relationship,
balanced on the cusp of
friendship and romance, is
the fulcrum around which
the drama of the second
act revolves.
An added conceit is that
these characters are per-
forming the play within
a play: they have been
conjured up by a young
university student, Jasper,
who is led by Morgan
(Paul Hilton) – a thinly
veiled Forster who shifts
the narrative at intervals
to probe further into a
character’s motives, or to
offers pearls of wisdom.
In collecting a group
of characters that rep-
resent both the past and
present Lopez attempts to
construct a grand unified
theory what it means to
be a gay man in America
today. In this regard, The
Inheritance attempts to
be a successor to the great
gay American plays of the
20th
century: Angels in
America and The Normal
Heart. Conceptually it
is a melding of the two:
epic in scope, like Angels,
with just a hint of magical
realism, and a generous
dose of philosophizing for
good measure; while also
domestic like The Normal
Heart, less angry perhaps,
but just as specific. It is
a shame then that The
Inheritance never quite
measures up to either.
When dealing with
the main elements of the
plot, Lopez is excellent,
and the action unfolds
with soapy flourishes.
The cast, all immensely
capable, with Burnap
as its most charismatic
star, are cheered (and
sometimes, jeered) on by
the audience. Although
immensely long, the
play, like the gossipiest
of Netflix dramas, is im-
mensely watchable. When
it comes to the politics,
however, the play flags.
The normally chirpy dia-
logue dissolves into stifled
prose. In these awkward
scenes the characters that
elsewhere seem so vital
andfullyrealisedlosetheir
voices, collapsing into
two-dimensional vehicles
for Lopez’ proletizing.
Paul Hilton alone is able
to carry the weight of the
words and make them his
own; as a result, Hilton is
Matthew Lopez’ reimagining of Howard’s End attempts to be present a grand unified theory of what it means to
be gay in America today.

“The action

“Paul Hilton

wonderful throughout, de-
livering his performance
with understated grace.
The direction by
Stephen Daldry, support-
ed by Bob Crowley’s
fantastic design and Jon
Clark’s lighting is simi-
larly understated – but,
in moments, transcend-
ent. In one particularly
memorable, incredibly
moving scene, Eric visits
Walter’s home to find the
place haunted. The ghosts
of the young men who
came there to die as the
city was ravaged by the
AIDS crisis descend from
the Circle. In their dozens,
actors scramble over the
mesmerised audience,
greeting each other and
Eric as they reach the
stage that becomes suf-
fused with golden light.
There are a couple of
other such truly beautiful
scenes but more often than
not these are undermined
by Lopez’s unfortunate
tendency to over-egg his
writing and compulsively
add just another phrase to
underscore how emotion-
al a scene truly is. Once or
twice this can be excused
but by the second half I
wanted to climb on stage
and clap my hand over the
mouths of the actors, and
implore them to please
hold their lines, to let a
moment simply be.
Lopez’ ambition is
impressive but The
Inheritance’s desperation
to be capital-I-Important
is conspicuously effortful.
It would’ve benefited
from a ruthless edit, I
wish more than anything
that he had crafted this
work with more trust in
his audience and under-
stood the power of a well
placed pause.
This is the world pre-
miere and previews were
rife with script changes,
but we can but hope that
Lopez finds it within
himself to pare down this
gargantuan work – consid-
er it as knocking the edges
of an uncut diamond, the
brilliance is in there, the
light just needs to get in.
