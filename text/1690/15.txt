When Sting met Shaggy
Despite sounding like a bad April fool’s joke, the collaborative album between Sting and Shaggy is actually
surprisingly decent collision between artistry and meme.

ep, that
h a p p e n e d .
You read it
correctly. It’s
not a misprint. The former
frontman of ‘80s pop-rock
group The Police really
did make an album with
Mr. Boombastic himself,
and they really did release
it on 4/20. Honestly, I’m
still in as much disbelief
as you. It all sounds like
a joke. In accordance, I
thought this review would
be something of a joke as
well, but, surprisingly, the
album is not actually as
terrible as you’d expect.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s
far from amazing, but
there are certainly some
good songs to be found.
So how did the most
unexpected collaboration
of the century come
about? Well, Sting and
Shaggy claim they have a
lot in common. Somehow
I doubt that, but one thing
they definitely do share
is mutual friend Martin
Kirszenbaum (a.k.a.
Cherry Cherry Boom
Boom) – founder of Cher-
rytree Records and Sting’s
manager. He happened to
be working in the studio
with Shaggy and asked
Sting to sing a chorus on
‘Don’t Make Me Wait’.
That in itself isn’t so
weird. Such things are
commoninshowbusiness.
to record a whole album.
That turned out to be a bit
too much for the world –
or at least for Sting fans.
Over the years we got
used to his experiments,
such as Songs from the
Labyrinth, a collection of
renaissance songs written
by John Dowland, or,
more recently, The Last
Ship, a musical about the
collapse of Newcastle’s
shipbuilding industry.
Seemingly unlikely col-
laborations aren’t even
that rare anymore (think
Elton John and Eminem,
Paul McCartney and
Kanye). But still, I’m not
sure anyone was prepared
for this head-on collision
of artist and meme.
Whiplash runs through
the record. The point of
such collaborations is to
step out of your comfort
zone, try new things, and
adapt to a different envi-
ronment and partner. Sting
was heavily influenced
by reggae in his Police
days, so perhaps it wasn’t
completely new territory
for him, but he’s never
made a straight reggae
album like 44/876. It
does, however, serve as a
reminder of how versatile
a musician he is, another
instance of him taking
an alien genre and seam-
lessly integrating into it.
It’s also worth pointing
out his spotless vocals
on the album. Decades
of rigorous practice has
allowed Sting to perfect
and maintain his voice in
spite of aging. Obviously
it has changed, but in
a good way – it sounds
strong, mature, and still
absolutely flawless.
Unfortunately, the
same cannot be said of
Shaggy. He seems stuck
in his dancehall manner
throughout, either unable
or unwilling to leave
his comfort zone. Both
musicians have argued
that their voices nicely
complement each other.
I disagree. I’m not sure
if it’s just a preference
or because I can’t detach
from ‘Mr. Boombastic’,
but I find his vocals
irritating. And I’m not
the only one. While some
Sting fans accept his new
friend, many others are
desperately trying to get
‘Shaggyless’ mixes and
album covers. Not a great
sign.
most of the album. Slight
pop-leanings are seen
in ‘Gotta Get Back My
Baby’ and ‘Don’t Make
Me Wait’, but not at the
expense of more reflective
tunes.
The great American
Dream (or lack thereof)
has been the subject of
many recent releases (see:
LCD Soundsystem, David
Byrne). Sting & Shaggy
offer their take from the
perspective of migrants in
Police-like ‘Dreaming in
the USA’. The lyrics are
a conversation between
singers, each presenting
their own views. This
thread runs through other
tracks such ‘Just One
Lifetime’ and ‘Crooked
Tree’.
The best is saved until
last. The highlight of the
album is undoubtedly
‘Sad Trombone’ – a nos-
talgia-tinged slow groover
with minimal Shaggy-
isms, a jazzy flavour,
and touching lyrics about
unhappiness in love.
Rounding off is ‘Night
Shift’, which emulates a
similar vibe (although lyr-
ically different), bringing
the LP to a neat end.
To summarise, the
idea of Sting recording
a reggae album was
definitely a hit, but his
choice of collaborator
perhaps missed the mark
somewhat. If he’d teamed
up with somebody more
flexible and imaginative,
such as Horace Andy, he
could’ve ended up with
something far more inter-
esting than nice reggae.
Although, Sting has
often said in interviews
that the most important
thing in music for him is
the element of surprise.
Well it’s safe to say that
everyone was astonished
by this collaboration. If
that was the goal, mission
accomplished.
“The artists’
collaboration
is a bit too
much for the
world – or at
least for Sting
fans, who are
asking for
‘Shaggyless’
mixes”
But, the guys apparently
enjoyed working together
so much that they decided
“Over the
years Sting has
experimented,
but I’m not
sure anyone
was prepared
for this head-
on collision”
Perhaps this is a bit
harsh. At the end of the
day, Shaggy is a good
entertainer – he was the
only artist who really got
the crowd going at the
Queen’s birthday party
last Saturday. And if it
wasn’t for him we would
probably never have heard
the Newcastle rockman
singing ‘It wasn’t me’
(check it out on YouTube,
you won’t regret it).
If you do give 44/876
a go, don’t be put off
by the opener, a typical
dancehall track akin to
Shaggy’s earlier work
with introductory lyrics
– by far the worst on the
record. This unimagina-
tive start is followed by
the optimistic, Marley-es-
que ‘Morning is coming’.
Once ignited, this
warm reggae flame burns
soothingly throughout
