F
or those una-
ware of what a
flagship species
is: it is a species
selected by a conserva-
tion organisation, such
as the World Wide Fund
(WWF), to act as an icon
or symbol for a defined
issue or environmental
problem. This being
said, you are all prob-
ably thinking of one of
the best-known flagship
species: the giant panda.
By focusing on such
a species and working
towards its conservation,
the status of other species
within the same habitat,
or species exposed to
similar levels of threats,
may also benefit.
That all sounds well
and good, but there are a
few issues: one thing you
may have already realised
is that flagship species
are disproportionately
is a plain brown snail, or
an extremely rare plant
species – a dilemma most
likely playing out on the
island of Hawaii.
This is because drabber
and relatively boring
speciesareunlikelytograb
the attention of potential
donors, despite the fact
that they may need just
as much protection as, for
example, elephants. Some
modern conservation
organisations have exer-
cised different approaches
to rectify this bias seen
towards large mammals
by looking at endangered
species in a new light.
Examples of these include
the EDGE project, run by
the Zoological Society of
London, and Hotspots,
run by Conservation In-
ternational.
EDGE aims to conserve
one-of–a-kind species
that are facing extinction,
and have scored different
groups of the world’s
animals on how evolution-
arily distinct and globally
endangered they currently
are. Similarly, Hotspots
is a scheme that takes a
more landscape-based
approach, raising both
awareness and funds
for regions of the world
identified to have more
endemic species also
under the threat of dis-
appearing. Both of these
schemes are moving away
from the flagship species
concept as we have known
it, and trying to use the
limited funds available
more effectively.
The emphasis on a par-
ticular species may be det-
rimental in the long run,
as the public look past the
threats and impacts affect-
ing certain habitats. It is
vitally important that edu-
cation, action, and policy
extend past the flagship
species to less attractive
species and prevent this
public complacency from
forming. 21st
century
conservation needs to
move forward, away
from flagship species,
and take a more holistic
approach.

Quickening: Why you need that kick
I
am not a mother
myself, but I imagine
having a tiny human
kicking and moving
around in your womb can
feel quite uncomfortable.
At some point, you may,
out of frustration, wonder:
why do they move around
so much?!
Aresearch group co-led
by Paula Murphy from
Trinity College Dublin
has been able to provide
the answer: to develop the
joints. Based on observing
clinical conditions where
movement is restricted
or limited, scientists
postulate that movement
and mechanical forces
are required for joint
development and mainte-
nance in adults. However,
little is known about the
molecular details of how
this works. This group
in Dublin is the first to
identify key pathways
involved in the mechano-
sensing aspect of joint
development.
These findings do
not just concern expect-
ing parents or science
enthusiasts. With an
ageing population and an
ever-increasing number
of individuals suffering
from joint diseases,
regenerative medicine
offers an attractive option
to treat joint problems. By
identifying key molecular
developmental cues, we
could be a step closer to
bringing this technology
to the clinic.
Regenerative medicine,
namely the use of stem
cells, is used to regen-
erate or repair damaged
tissues. Following cell
development, they turn
into a specific cell type,
for example cartilage.
Scientists have been able
to do just this by mimick-
ing the natural process of
development.
During development,
the embryo matures and
undergoes a process
called differentiation,
meaning the cells become
specialised into different
types, which carry out a
particular function. In the
process of differentiation
– whether it is during
development or in the lab
– cells require precise and
accurate communication
with each other. Imagine
the game of Telephone,
where the objective of
the game is to pass a
message along the entire
group without distorting
it. As a child, the final
statements are often
hilariously divergent due
to the accumulation of
errors. However, if this
happens to differentiating
cells, a deformed body
can result. Comparative-
ly, cells perform much
better than us, as multiple
complex communication
systems are used to ensure
the right cell receives the
right message.
Humans use words and
is important. In previous
research, mouse and chick
embryos that had their
movement restricted had
an abnormal distribution
of cartilage cells across
the joint region. With
this new research, the
molecular pathway that
responded to this mechan-
ical stress has now been
identified.
By studying gene
expression profiles of
animals that were im-
mobilised in the embryo
during the developmental
stage, a few molecular
pathways – namely the ca-
nonical Wnt and BMP sig-
nalling – were highlighted
to be instrumental. In
particular, the regulation
of these pathways modu-
lates expression of genes
that allow cells to sense
the mechanical stimuli
around them, and/or drive
differentiation to a carti-
lage lineage. For instance,
Smurf1 is shown to create
a permissive environment
for appropriate cartilage
differentiation. Further-
more, genetic knockout
studies have shown the
activation of canonical
Wnt is essential for normal
joint development. This
evidence reported that
along with the reduction
of Wnt signalling, the
lack of movement causes
the ectopic activation
of BMP signalling via
the down-regulation of
Smurf1/2, and is pivotal
to joint development.
While the study was
conducted on chickens
and mice, it is likely
that this mechanism is
evolutionarily conserved
across vertebrates. Con-
sequently, there is a high
probability that such
findings are applicable to
humans, both in terms of
understanding congenital
defects and developing
regenerative therapies for
joint diseases.
