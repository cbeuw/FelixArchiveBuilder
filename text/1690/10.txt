Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons: a reimagining at the Sam
Wanamaker Playhouse
Gyre & Gimble effortlessly fuse cutting-edge puppetry with Max Richter’s beautifully recomposed rendition of The
Four Seasons.
T
he Sam
W a n a m a k e r
Playhouse offers
an intimate set-
ting for the most recent
works of Gyre & Gimble’s
collaboration with con-
temporary composer Max
Richter. This creative
alchemy was inspired by
the traditional Japanese
form of Bunraku, where
half-life-size dolls act out
a chanted dramatic narra-
tive. Emma Rice, Artistic
Director, describes the
production as a combina-
tion of “virtuosity from so
many disciplines: compo-
sition and re-composition,
adaption, musicianship,
puppetry, performance,
and design.” All these
mediums come together
synergistically to create
an astonishing production.
Sitting in the Sam
Wanamaker Playhouse is
an absolute delight. The
candle-lit chandeliers,
hanging from the painted
ceiling, reflect warm
light on the gold foil
wallpaper and illuminate
the landscape for Gyre
& Gimble’s puppeteers.
The playhouse, opened
in 2014, was inspired by
17th
century architecture
and based on drawings
by John Webb from
1660. Candle expert John
Russell was consulted for
the 72 candles held in six
metal chandeliers, hoisted
on pulleys up to eight feet
above the stage.
The show begins with
a brief prelude of pieces
from works by Vivaldi,
Geminiani, and Purcell.
Whether you are a clas-
sical music enthusiast or
not, this short repertoire
is thoroughly enjoyable
for all. The chamber
orchestra, composed of
six musicians, is placed
in the balcony above the
stage, filling the cavern-
“Puppeteers
exhibit
obvious skill
and poise
as they
manipulate
their charges”
“The
production
has more in
common with
ballet than
traditional
theatre”
ous theatre with clear,
unamplified tones. First
violinist Jorge Jimenez
falters at times, but the
technically challenging
score is otherwise handled
well by all.
Alongside the beautiful
music, Gyre & Gimble’s
co-directors, Finn
Caldwell and Toby Olié,
bring to stage a striking
display of puppetry at its
very best. The puppeteers
move around the stage
dressed in black without
detracting attention from
the wooden mannequins.
They exhibit obvious
skill and poise as they
meticulously manipulate
the puppets, yet flawlessly
capture the very essence
of the human form with
each movement. From
the impetuous leap of a
child, to the deep breaths
of a mother surrendering
to death, the five outra-
geously talented puppet-
eers breathe life into their
wooden puppets, encap-
sulating the human con-
dition in a more profound
way than many actors
on stage. The puppets’
design is simplistic, with
a neutral face, showing no
emotion, and a body that
allows for finer control of
movements. Despite – or
maybe because of – the
blank mannequin-like
faces, each spectator can
project their own emotion
onto the blank canvas,
creating their own unique
perception of the story,
allowing the audience to
partake in creating and
defining the narrative.
Vivaldi’s Four Seasons
offers the perfect template
for a cyclical narrative,
where life, death, and
renewal all take place. At
times, the cyclical theme
of love and loss creates
a sense of platitude, but
these moments are quickly
overshadowed by the raw
emotion on stage. The
emotional colour of the
music feeds the mood of
the story and creates the
peaks and troughs of the
storyline. At times, there
appears to be a deliberate-
ly ironic contrast between
mournful melodies and
optimistic scenes, which
accurately captures the
complexity of human
emotion.
Vivaldi’s Four Seasons
is heard far too often as
jingles in elevators or on
hold on the phone, making
us all a bit disenchanted
by the melodies. In spite
of this, Max Richter
boldly reclaims and
re-envisions the piece,
infusing life back into it.
Originally composed for
four separate parts within
a string orchestra, Max
Richter’s re-composition
includes the addition of a
synthesiser and a harpsi-
chord. I am unconvinced
by the incorporation of a
classically baroque instru-
ment like the harpsichord
woven into Vivaldi’s
cannons, as it does little
to enhance the piece,
and seems to conform
Vivaldi’s fluttering
cannons into a more rigid
form. Although Richter’s
passion for Bach and
Baroque-esque motifs is
easily identifiable in his
reconstruction, it feels
out of place. Typical
of Vivaldi, energetic
cheerful cannons gradu-
ally become synchronised
and later transition to
solemn melodies. Richter
does well to preserve this.
The production has
more in common with
ballet than traditional
theatre, owing to the fact
that the narrative is por-
trayed visually through
the medium of puppetry,
without a spoken script.
Like dance, the move-
ments of the puppets are
free-flowing and compli-
menting of the music.
There are honestly not
enough words to describe
how captivating and en-
thralling this production
is. It oozes charm with
elegant simplicity. The
puppets are most mesmer-
ising; the fluidity of their
motions and the uncanny
resemblance to our own
movements make them
endlessly intriguing and
entertaining even if the
narrative were removed.

THE FOUR SEASONS
Ballet Black: glorious and achingly beautiful
T
his March,
Ballet Black, the
company con-
sisting entirely
of BAME performers,
returned to the Barbican
with a double bill. Their
offering was a show in
two halves; neither of
these were traditional
performances, but rather a
showcase of the power of
modern ballet.
The first half, cho-
reographed by Cathy
Marston, inspired by Can
Themba’s short story The
Suit was slow, sad, and
achingly beautiful. With
little else but a couple
of chairs, a sheet, and
a hanger, the scene of
a happy household was
set smoothly, with Cira
Robinson’s Matilda and
Jose Alvarez’s Philemon
getting ready for the
day. Around them the
impressive corps dance
with well-honed skills;
beginning as furniture,
they transfigure them-
selves into reflections of
Philemon and Matilda in
the mirror as they mime
washing their faces and
brushing their teeth.
Perfectly in sync, their
movements are nothing
short of mesmerising. As
Philemon left for work and
the corps followed, fluidly
morphing into passers by
in the street, Mthuthuzeli
November’s Simon
took his place alongside
Matilda in bed. As
Alvarez danced stage left,
Robinson and November
performed a sensual pas
de deux, bodies moving
with captivating slinki-
ness to the whine of the
strings. When Philemon
returns to pick up his
forgotten briefcase he is
greeted with the evidence
of his wife’s betrayal. In
a hurry to leave, Simon
leaves behind his suit.
The shock of Philemon’s
discovery of the affair is
followed by an poignant
attempt at reconciliation,
but the suit, the mani-
festation of Matilda’s
betrayal, lingers. It haunts
the couple, taking the
place of an extra guest at
dinner, Philemon, unable
to forgive, pushes Matilda
to dance with the suit at a
party as he watches sul-
lenly from the sidelines.
The story quickly moves
towards tragedy: Matilda,
tortured by Philemon’s
intransigence, desperate
to make amends, attempts
but fails to destroy the
suit. In an heartwrenching
conclusion to the allegori-
cal tale, in the end, the suit
destroys her.
In contrast, the second
half of the show, Arthur
Pita’s Dream Within
a Midsummer’s Night
Dream was delightfully
light hearted. Borrowing
fromtheShakespeareclas-
sic, at the outset it seems
to be deeply traditional:
three couples in sumptu-
ous tutus begin a routine
to Handel. Slowly how-
ever the music grinds to a
halt and, frozen in place,
the dancers succumb to
sleep, lit in flickers by a
lazily gliding disco ball,
as Puck (a magnificent
Isabela Coarcy) dressed
as a boy scout comes to
spirit them away. In an
instant the stereotypical,
tidy ballet is cut short.
When the dancers awake
they are in a fantasy
realm. The remainder of
the performance in which
the dancers navigate
their new surroundings is
accompanied by a chaotic
soundtrack. Eartha Kitt’s
‘Let’s Do It’ opens
proceedings. Then Marie
Astrid Mence’s Hermia
snorts Puck’s fairy dust
and sambas to the jaunty
tunes of Yma Sumac’s
‘Malambo No. 1,’
pairing off with Sakaya
Ichikawa’s Helena in the
process. The choreogra-
phy is quick – with fast
footwork and fluid move-
ments. Ebony Thomas’s
Lysander and Mthuthuzeli
November’s Demitrius
seem unconcerned by
their loss of former part-
ners and seem perfectly
happy in each other’s
arms. Jose Alvarez’s
Oberon is left pining
after them. Meanwhile in
an unexpectedly tender
segment Titania dances
with Bottom to the
Barbara Streisand cover
of ‘Bewitched, Bothered
and Bewildered’. A
huge-headed Salvador
Dali pops up to add to the
surreal feel of the colours
and eclectic music. Pita’s
ode and subversion of
to classicism is glorious
and ridiculous in equal
measure.
In a post-show talk, the
founder of the company,
the lead of the show, and a
host discussed some of the
motivations behind put-
ting the company together
and the difficulties it has
faced. The traditional pink
ballet shoe was compared
to salmon coloured
plasters – a ‘nude’ shade
designed to deliver a
purpose to the mainstream
and simply be put up with
by people of colour – the
abnormal afterthought.
Ballet Black’s rainbow of
different nude shades is
quietly revolutionary, and
illustrates the diversity
they are bringing to the
industry. Founder Cassa
Pancho spoke about her
idea to set up the platform
for BAME dancers after
failing to find a single
ballet dancer who was
a person of colour in the
UK to interview for her
university dissertation.
That platform now exists,
and the company and
its dancers are critically
acclaimed. The company
aims to be obsolete – the
aim is its dancers will be
role models and encour-
age more people of colour
to get involved in ballet.
Once the whole industry
is more diverse, a specific
platform to give BAME
dancer’s an opportunity
will not be necessary,
opportunities will be pro-
vided by all companies.
Despite the company’s
progressive mission
statement, one particular
question in the Q&A
about Eurocentric beauty
ideals in ballet showed the
art has further to go before
it can truly be described
as inclusive. Ballet Black
has unequivocally done
wonders for diversifying
casts in term of race, but it
seems requirements to be
a certain height and body
shape to be casted are still
present. Ballerinas still
need to fit a mould, albeit
a slightly looser one.

their nationwide tour
