IC badminton men’s 2nd
team celebrate promotion by
maintaining perfect run
SPORTS

H
aving won all
eight of their
league matches
prior to this
one, IC badminton men’s
2nd
team have effectively
won the South Eastern
2A division, and secured
a promotion to the di-
vision above. However,
apart from us social
members witnessing a
gif of 2nd
Team Captain
Noah Semonin dabbing
his beanie off during the
club’s AGM, news of that
achievement has probably
stayed within the IC teams
for the most part, so Club
President Joseph Kim
invited me to cover the
2nd
team’s home match
against Surrey’s 2nd
team
at Ethos last Wednesday.
I had time to have a
chat with the IC team
before the matches, and it
was great to see a relaxed
atmosphere within the
team, with cheerful faces
all around. Unsurprising-
ly, they took it very well
when I told them not to
lose the tie so I didn’t
have to report that!
The Surrey team even-
tually arrived 45 minutes
late, and – to make matters
worse in what I imagine
must’ve been an already
tiring trip to London –
they weren’t able to field
a full team, effectively
giving us a two point lead
in the tie before it even
started.
Matchday started with
the singles matches, and
Matthew Cotton got IC
off to a good start, taking
the 1st
game 21-11 with a
convincing performance.
His opponent upped his
game to win 21-17 and
level the match, but any
alarm bells that might’ve
raised were silenced when
he sealed the match with
a 21-13 win in the rubber
game. Concurrently,
Ranul Pallemulle — our
other singles player —
endured a slower start to
his day. He won a number
of points from his sturdy
defence, forcing his
opponent to aim for the
sidelines, but he never
quite settled into his
match and lost it 13-21,
14-21.
Up next was Jeremy
Lou and team captain
Noah in the doubles, and
they too endured a rather
slow start, improving as
the game went on but
ultimately losing a close
first game 17-21. The
pressure was on in the 2nd
game, and they responded
by turning up the heat.
But perhaps the tension
got to them as they made
some unforced errors here
and there, losing the next
game 20-22.
It now came down to
Edward Liu and Joseph
to deliver a point from
the doubles, and they did
so emphatically, taking
their match 21-11, 21-13
with a dominant perfor-
mance. Their smashes and
netplay paid dividends,
but crucially it was their
tight serves which made
the telling difference
compared to Jeremy and
Noah, giving their oppo-
nents no room to apply
pressure right from the
off.
While I turned my
attention to the doubles, it
was a Matt vs Matt affair
on the other court; unfor-
tunately it was Surrey’s
who took the match with
a 21-16 22-20 victory.
Ranul, however, made
amends for his earlier loss
to Surrey’s Matt, winning
his 2nd
match 21-13,
21-17. That sealed the tie
for IC, and preserved the
team’s perfect run.
Of course, no match is
complete without inter-
views of sort, so I asked
Noah for a comment on
the team’s performance
this season:
“The key things this
year are the consistency
of the guys playing week
in week out, building
chemistry as a team and
supporting each other on
and off court. Everything
that’s been achieved
is because of the team
playing their hardest and
delivering the perfor-
mances needed. As much
as being the captain is
important, doing this well
relies on the players being
willing to play, travel, and
put in the performances,
so I owe massive thanks
to everyone that’s played
over the course of this
year.”
“The initial aim for next
year is to hold our own
within the league, and if
things go well enough
then pushing again for a
win in that league too!”
I then asked Joseph for
comment about the club:
“It’s really great to
see all that the society
has achieved this year.
None of our other teams
were relegated and have
all shown massive im-
provements, meaning we
can push for promotions
next academic year. This
year’s committee has also
improved the quality of
badminton events and
socials. The popular
Friday coaching sessions
has seen large turnouts
with several players im-
proving greatly over the
past two terms.”
“Furthermore, we’ve
successfully hosted two
London-wide tourna-
ments this year thanks
to our partnership with
Yonex. With the next
committee decided, I
really hope the society
can continue to blossom.”
We followed this up
with our last match,
against Chichester – we
drew the tie 4-4, so lost
our perfect record, but
still finished the season
unbeaten. All the best
guys. Congratulations
and keep flying the flag
for IC!

Cracking open a cold run with the boys
L
ast month, with
the ‘mini-beast
from the East’
spreading its
frosty tendrils over the
North Sea, the Met Office
issued amber warnings for
wind, ice, and snow across
much of the UK. The same
time, a detachment of
hardy (foolish?) ICXCAC
trail runners left London
with their sights set on a
very long run along the
barren, wind-beaten cliff-
tops of the Sussex coast.
This is their story…
Those of us tackling
the ultra- and mara-
thon-distance races
stayed overnight at club
member Remy’s house
(huge thank you to Mr.
and Mrs. Shaieb!), whilst
those with later start times
took early trains on the
Saturday morning. With
all involved hunkering
down for the night, the
cold closed in…
05:30 AM – Good
morning, this is your
wake-up call! After
last-minute kit checks
(Leggings or shorts?
Definitely leggings) and
industrial quantities of
porridge, the team pile
into cars and head to the
start line.
8:00 AM – Standing in
a field waiting for the ultra
race briefing, we realise it
is definitely cold.
8:30 AM – Ultra-mar-
athon start. 130 hardy
endurance runners set off
clad in multiple layers
of fluorescent Gore-Tex.
Ahead of them is 55km
of challenging, but varied
and beautiful terrain. It’s
still really cold.
9:00 AM – Marathon
start. A similar number
of waterproof ward-
robes on display here,
although Richard ‘Paleo’
Thompson isn’t wearing
any shoes. He assures
us this is deliberate, and
he’s got some crocs in
case it gets too rocky. So
this is what goes on in
the Physics department?
I think it’s getting colder.
10:00 AM – At
10-20km in, our ultra and
marathon runners are all
in good spirits, taking in
local landmarks includ-
ing the Litlington white
horse, and the Long Man
of Wilmington. Interest-
ingly, these hill carvings
aren’t half as ancient as
you might imagine, being
cut in the 19th
and 17th
centuries respectively. I
digress. Is this blossom or
snow?
10:30 AM – Half-mar-
athon start. Despite a far
less extensive mandatory
kit list, the 370 starters are
wearing a lot of clothes
for a spring half marathon.
The starter’s gun is fired.
Meanwhile, marathoners
are beginning to catch the
tail end of the ultra race,
providing much needed
company and morale
boosts. It’s definitely
snowing now. The pretty
fluffy kind. Still cold.
11:00AM – This is now
a real life actual blizzard.
In late March. What’s
going on?
11:30 AM – 10k start.
200 brave and speedy
souls tear away from the
start line and into the
storm, wearing little more
than shorts and a t-shirt.
They the real MVPs. At
least they’re all wearing
shoes. I hope Richard
Hobbitson still has all his
toes.
12:00 PM – As the
leading half-marathoners
hit the final descent from
the magnificent Beachy
Head towards home (and
warmth), the 10k runners
approach the halfway
mark and join the ultra/
marathon route. Being
passed after three hours
of running by a stream
of sprightly 10k runners
(who are going twice your
pace and making it look
easy) brings up conflicting
and fairly toxic emotions,
but it’s all part of the fun.
I’m told -7o
C wind chill is
part of the fun too.
12:30 PM – 30mph
wind now driving hori-
zontal snow into the faces
of runners in all categories
running up Beachy Head.
??:??PM–Tobehonest,
this is where things get a
little hazy for me. At some
point the snow stopped,
but I’m pretty sure it was
still cold. Meanwhile the
10k and Half marathon
runners head to the pub
for a free (!) pint.
After a long day of
running, the key stats
were as follows: 17
Imperial runners braved
the elements, and made
it home safely. Ultra
runners climbed 1750m
(Courchevel), and took
home two Ultra-Trail Du
Mont-Blanc qualification
points on the way. Mar-
athoners scaled 1350m
(Ben Nevis), the half
marathon squad made
650m look easy (it’s
not), and the 10k speed
demons smashed 430m
(2820 vertical pints.) As
usual there was plenty of
ICXCAC representation
at the front of the field,
with Jess Eichel and Mark
Pollock taking under-20
titles in the half marathon,
and trail captain Henry
Hart posting a winning
10k time of 50’47”, only
to be disqualified for
an unlucky checkpoint
‘dibbing’ error.
Most importantly,
everyone finished despite
very challenging con-
ditions (30 DNFs in the
ultra alone.) Even Richard
‘Bilbo’ Thompson made
it through the day without
frostbite. We saw many
fantastic personal perfor-
mances, including first
trail races, first marathons,
and longest ultras. This is
a side of the club that is
going from strength to
strength.
Finally, huge thank-
yous to Remy and family
for hosting us, trail captain
Henry for organising the
trip, Luis for supporting,
and the race organisers
for keeping everyone safe
in spite of completely
horrendous conditions.
Fencing Men’s Second Team finish a triumphant year
I
n terms of BUCS
points scored, fenc-
ing remains the most
successful club at
Imperial, and it has been
an especially incredible
season for the Men’s
Second team. Remaining
undefeated throughout
our fourteen matches has
led to promotion to a tier
one league; a level never
before reached by the
team.
The year started with
a strong home victory
against Portsmouth,
135-50, spurring on
support. Our now eight
match clean sheet was
threatened whilst fencing
Portsmouth again, this
time away, and a nail
biting result of 135-124
taught us not to get
complacent. Both Niklas
and Cosmin were crucial
team members during first
term, especially for these
close league matches.
The team also claimed
the South Eastern Con-
ference Cup. We quickly
progressed to the quarter-
finals, where we beat our
closest league competi-
tors, Brunel, 129-111.
The home semi-final
match against LSE
gathered a huge crowd,
both fencers and non-fenc-
ers alike, who enjoyed
supporting with some
appropriately-coloured
blue pompoms. Using
some strategic planning,
we won the highly antic-
ipated match with hits to
spare.
Eight of us, armed with
two supporters, travelled
to Kent for the final. The
support continued at
home, with nearly 3000
views on the Facebook
live stream. With the score
set at 71-70, it all came
down to the final weapon,
epée. The score switched
in favour of both teams
three times, and the match
concluded, 116-102, with
three decisive wins from
each of the epeeist, Rob,
Jake and finally, per-
forming under immense
pressure, Noah.
From Rob’s consistent
flicks and David’s sig-
nature spin, to Javier’s
incredible ability to fence
all three weapons, and
Péter’s scare tactics, each
member brought a differ-
ent style to our matches.
A number of memories
deserve a special mention:
Hugo’s liberating party
performance; the christen-
ing of David’s kitchen; the
multiple occasions where
we were unable to stop
for a service break; cel-
ebrating with magnums;
and, of course, most of
us enjoying ACC events
(some more than others).
Many thanks must go to
team members Noah and
Javier as our designated
drives, and David Guo,
our in-team photographer,
as well as Sports Imperial,
particularly Yasmin, for
all of the support and
organisation.
Both Javier and
Cosmin have fenced their
final season at Imperial.
We wish them good luck,
and hope they return to
support for years to come.
The team will be in
great hands next year
with the newly elected
captain, Hugo. We hope
to continue our successes
in our new league, and
have more to celebrate
next year.
