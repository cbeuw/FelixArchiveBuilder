A
rmed police
had to be
called to Cen-
tral Library
earlier this week, as
arguments over desk al-
locations escalated into
a full-scale riot.
At around 4pm last
Wednesday, shortly fol-
lowing the mid-afternoon
caffeine slump, an alter-
cation broke out on Level
4 of the Central Library.
This quickly developed
into a mass brawl, spread-
ing to adjacent floors, as
students took out their
revision frustrations by
setting fire to textbooks
and occupying the Library
Cafe.
Speculations abound
over the cause of the vio-
lence. Hangman spoke to
a number of students who
reported different triggers
for the brawl. Some eye-
witnesses said students
were “left mad with rage
and unsated hunger” after
the Library Cafe ran out
of jacket potatoes by
12.30pm; others say the
high temperatures in the
Library earlier in the week
– described as “categor-
ically unsafe for human
habitation” – aggravated
existing tensions.
Several students identi-
fied the original instigator
as Susan Hillbury, a third
year chemistry students.
Hillbury, who is now in
police custody, denied any
wrongdoing: “In my eyes,
my behaviour was com-
pletely justified. The twat
next to me had dropped
off his stuff on a desk at
9am, and didn’t come
back until after lunch.
He then spent three hours
watching episodes of The
Big Bang Theory and
laughing along. I couldn’t
stand it any more, and
eventually just bottled
the guy. Things kind of
escalated from there.”
section of the Library
and attempting to fashion
Molotov cocktails, de-
scribed the riot as “fright-
ening, but pretty good
procrastination material.”
“I’d really had just
about enough of going
through my mechan-
ics lectures,” he told
Hangman, “I needed a
break. It was either go on
Facebook and stalk my
ex’s profile, or headbutt
the guy next to me.”
In a statement for
Hangman, police forces
said: “We were called
to Imperial College
London’s Central Library
at 15:56 on Wednesday
to deal with what had
been described as a

‘procrastination-induced
riot’. Our officers were
on the scene within 20
minutes. They managed to
control the situation with
no injuries to our officers,
and minimal fatalities
among students – mostly
material students.”
The library will remain
closed for the remainder
of this week. Mark Halley,
Vice-Provost (Sporadic
Acts of Random Vio-
lence) emailed students
earlier today regarding
the closure, advising them
to “remember to respect
others when using the
library”, “avoid using
up more space than you
need”, and “just generally
get a fucking grip.”

The announcement
came after numerous
reports of students
who didn’t know what
the large orb in the sky
was.

I
mperial College
London have con-
firmed that the short
appearance of sum-
mer weather last week
can be used by students
wishing to apply for ex-
tenuating circumstances
in upcoming exams.
In an email sent out
to all Imperial stu-
dents, Larry Popovich,
Vice-Provost (Have You
Put On Sunscreen?), said
the “exceptional weather”
experienced over the pre-
vious weekend had caused
“distress and harm” to
many Imperial students
who were not used to
going outside or generally
interacting with the world.
“Senior management have
been informed by person-
al tutors of many students
emailing with concerns
over the weather,” Pop-
ovich wrote, “these con-
cerns have ranged from
the potential of heatstroke
in Central Library,
through to fears about
what exactly the glowing
orb in the sky was, and
whether it would hurt us.”
“Our mitigating
circumstances policy
includes a clause about
distressing meteorologi-
cal phenomena,” he went
on to say, “something that
certainly includes bright
sunshine in April.”
It is believed a number
of students have suffered
as a result of the weather.
One student Hangman
spoke to reported the
dangers of sun exposure:
“I saw people posting
about the weather on Face-
book, so I thought I’d take
a break from revision and
head to Queen’s Lawn.
Unfortunately, I’d been
revising in SAF for past
three weeks, and hadn’t
seen any proper sunlight.
As soon as I went outside
I was blinded by the glare;
I stumbled into the middle
of an ultimate frisbee
game and managed to
break my collarbone.”
Upon hearing the
reports of students being
exposed to above-ambient
temperature, Felicity
Connolly, Imperial
College Union’s Deputy
President (Fun in the
Sun), placed an imme-
diate order for £13,000
worth of sun-visors – in
Union-approved shades of
cyan and magenta – and
hypoallergenic sunscreen.
By the time the order
arrived, however, the sun
had disappeared behind
cloud cover. It is predicted
the sun will re-emerge
some time in mid-July, for
a couple of hours, before
retreating again.

extentuating circumstance for exams
This week it’s a brand
new term! A brand
new start! Same old
disappointing you!
This week you forgot to
set your alarm before the
marathon, and completely
miss it. You tell everyone
the guy in the giant
bumblebee suit was you –
they’ll never know.
This week you find out
the strikes for this term
have been cancelled. Now
you’ve got no excuse
about that third you’re
going to get.
This week, between the
heatwave in the library,
and all the crying you’ve
been doing over revision,
you’re taken to ChelWest
A&E with severe
dehydration.
This week you’re excited
by the addition of pastries
to the Union Shop. You
really don’t have much
going for you, do you?
This week you’re that one
guy who keeps coughing
in the library, oh my god,
will you just shut the fuck
up and have some lemsip
already.
This week you
purposefully leave your
stuff spread across several
library tables. People
asking you to move it is
the only social interaction
you’re gonna have for the
next couple of months.
This week you go to
Queen’s Tower Rooms to
get some lunch, and end
up accidentally sitting
a final-year Business
School exam. You get a
first.
This week you spend the
last of your student loan
sponsoring your friend in
the marathon. But it’s for
a good cause, and he ran
it in a giant bumblebee
suit! What a great guy!
This week you’re feeling
pretty stressed about your
exams, and decide to
go for counselling. You
should get seen by next
year.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you realise you’ve put
more work into these
than anything else you’ve
done all year. Worth it?
Yes.
