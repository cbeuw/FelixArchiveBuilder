RESIDENTS RIDICULED
May the 1st was the last day by whioh application forms
for admission to the College Hostel had to be submitted.
250 students applied for residenoe, and i f they had read
the regulations they would have noted that there were no rules
ofbehaviour sinoe these could not be both oomprehensible and
enforceable. Moreover, such rules would tend to be oppressive.
Eviction was the punishment for any student whose conduct was
considered an extreme oase of irresponsibility.
Residents have long been proud of this liberal treatment,
and have learned to tolerate other peoples idiosyncrasies or
to tell them off appropiately. Unfortunately, on the evening
of May 1st., the ruLss were modified. The Residents committee
'agreed' that the disciplinary sub-oommittee be empowered to
'gate' Residents who oomrait certain disciplinary offences
(unspecified). If i t was agreed, then the student represent
ativea betrayed their electorate. More likely i t was passed
by a majority. The senior residents now outnumber the
students by seven to four on -this committee. It was.also
agreed without consultation with the disciplinary committeec
who nominally would have to mete out this punishment.

Fortunately moat of the current residents have not been
intimidated by this absurd sanction, and have actually tended
to be more boisterous than before i t was introduced. This
may be to determine the standard of offences which entail
gating, or purely competition to achieve this honour. Many
see this as the thin edge of a wedge whioh will reduce
Hostel life to the silence of a monastery and desperation
of a Rowton House.

minions on the Residents com-
mittee, he selects the majority
of the disciplinary committee,
and his latest move has been
to reject one of the Imperial
College union representatives
on the selection of residents

power to reject anyone the
selected anyway, and although

must do so when the Warden
