At Putney Regatta on Saturday 12th May the Boat Club did
not fare particularly well. Neither the let or 2nd sights
participated and i t was left,to the 3rd eight in juniors and
the 4th eight in Maidens, to defend the honour of the Club.
The 3rd eight withdrew early in their race when stroke's
sliding seat broke. The 4th. eight was beaten by 3 lengths
by Kings' 2nd eight. The water was very rough, and in one
event two boats sunk and the third finished half full of
water.
On the previous Saturday Martin Gaylard sculled very
well to win the Junior Senior event at Hammersmith Regatta,
but failed to repeat his performance under the very rough
conditions at Putney.
