^ T f e r t c r B e u t S i i j e £i>tubententag
Once every two years German students hold a
r a l l y at which they meet to discuss some problem.
This year's r a l l y , attended by about 3,000 stud-
ents, was held i n Hamburg to discuss "The Student
in Society."
The organisers of this year's "studententag"
decided to combine the occasion with a meeting of
representatives of students of other Kuropean
countries. From jingland they invited one represent-
ative from 1J.U.S. , which, they know, claims to re-
present student opinion in this country; and one
from Imperial Colle'ge, which they know to be the
best s c i e n t i f i c and largest technical college i n
the country.
Similar invitations were sent by the University
of Berlin - Charlottenburg to their recent inter-
national meeting, which on this occasion f e l l in
the same year as the studententag. Since, however,
U.li.S. f a i l s somewhat apathetically to send repres-
entatives to these occasions, the representative "
from Imperial College has on each occasion been the
only i&iglish student present.
Altogether there were sixteen foreign visitors
to Hamburg. I t i s indeed gratifying to know that
Imperial College enjoys such an excellent internat-
ional reputation that i t alone of a l l jinglish c o l l -
eges i s invited to send a representative to such
functions.
The f u l l value of contacts of this sort i s im-
possible to estimate. Such meetings certainly fost-
er understanding and goodwill between the students
of jiuropean countries, and give the students of each
country the chance to appreciate the other fellow's
d i f f i c u l t i e s .
i'he thoughts of German students turn inevitably
to the present plight of their country, and i t s
effect on their lives and a c t i v i t i e s . Despite claims
of the "frea democratic" Eastern zone of better
conditions for their students, a steady stream of
students leave the jast for the West. The l o t of a
West (ierman studjnt i s by no means easy; only about
21% receive any financial assistance. Host of the
remainder have to work hard during the vacations,
or at night,to make ends meet. They can afford only
the poorest of "digs", and student hostel accomodat-
ion i s hopelessly inadequate. Many German students
are busy advocating a similar system of grants to
the B r i t i s h one.
The foreign"guests were royally entertained.
Trips were organised round Hamburg harbour, and to
Lubeck and the Baltie Sea. A reception on the night
of arrival soon found the foreign delegates chatting
animatedly to one another. A cocktail party given
by a gentleman who described himself as "American
Cultural Attache" was also a great success.. During
i t one of the foreign delegates donred a jjair of out-
size sunglasses. On -being questioned about this sur-
prising manoeuvre he explained: " I put t,hem>Oi. so
the people they cannot see my eyes they i s bloodshot."
Another foreign delegate attended a German "hop".
When asked '"hat he thought of i t he replied that he
was dissappointed: "There was no l i f e ; there was no
drunken men and there was' no dancing on the tables."
After swopping addresses, the foreigners returned
home. I.C. now has valued and interesting contacts
in many iSuropean countries. For many years we have
been, firm friends of the Universities of j e l f t and
Groningen i n Holland through the reciprocated v i s -
i t s of sports teams. Other teams have visited
France, Germany and Denmark. Several students of
the University of'Berlin - Chart.ottenburg,have v i s -
ited I.C. and several I.C. students have paid return
v i s i t s , headers are reminded that a scholarship for
anyone who would l i k e to l i v e and study in Berlin
for a year has beer, offered.
Perhaps I.C. could do i t s share in fostering
international studjnt goodwill by inviting i r e s i d -
ents of the leading liuropean technical colleges and
universities to a stay in I.C. sometime next year,
ifhen the new Union w i l l be on view.
EXPLORATION PROJECT, REYDARFJORD, Summer 1956
The second stage in the
exploration of a region, f o l l -
owing upon the preparation by
travellers and surveyors of
the f i r s t topographic maps, i s
marked by the incursion of
geologists, who find out what
the country i s made of. This
geological work i s true explor-
ation in the f u l l e s t meaning
of the word, and the geologist
has that feeling, common to a l l
explorers, of never knowing
what l i e s around the-next cor-
ner or across the next mount-
ain.
The small expedition to
Iceland planned for this summer
is for such geological explor-
ation. The area that i t i s
planned to cover i s reasonably
accessible and i s covered by
quite good topographic outlines
The expedition w i l l consist of
two undergraduate geology stud-
ents, Peter Ibbotson-and Malcrcls
McQueen; one post-graduate re-
search student, Ian Carmichael,
a welcome refugee from a r i v a l
concern (Cambridge); and l e c t -
urer G.P.L.Walker.
The area that i t i s planned to study l i e s around
Reydarfjord, a deep indentation midway along the
Bast Coast of Iceland. This summer's work w i l l be
a continuation and an extension of a study that was
commenced lasjs year following a reconnaissance v i s i t
in 1954, and i t in part of a long-term research pro-
ject.
By B r i t i s h standards Iceland i s a bleak and bar-
ren country, yet i t Is nevertheless Tery beautiful,
O.P.L.WALKiSR, a popular lecturer i n the Geology
Department, i s a specialist i n the type ef rooks
the expedition w i l l study. Be has nade f i e l d
studies ef basaltic reck i n Antrim and ether
places where they outcrop.
and the people are very
•friendly and hospitable.
The climate i s much lass
severe than i s suggested
by the name, and i t i s a
pity that Iceland i s r e l -
atively neglected by B r i t -
i s h tourists. The plan
is to spend the f i r s t fort-
night travelling about in
South-west and North Ice-
land i n the expedition
vehicle, v i s i t i n g classic
geological exposures, and
spend the remaining s i x to
nine weeks on detailed
\ geological mapping at Rey-
darfjord.
The country i n which
the work w i l l be done i s
very mountainous and i s
sparsely populated, and i t
w i l l be necessary to camp
and live under expedition
conditions for the whole
duration of the v i s i t . One
can only hope that i t w i l l
not rain a l l the time, and
that the midges w i l l not
be too belligerent.
The rocks composing Iceland are almost exclusively
Volcanic, and belong to a period i n the distant
past when hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of
basalt lavas were poured out onto a land surface
stretching probably continuously from the B r i t i s h
Isles to Greenland; volcanic lavas that are s t i l l
to be seen i n the Inner Hebrides, Antrim, the Far-
oes , Iceland and Greenland; lavas which i n places
(for instance, at Reydarfjord) have accumulated to
a thickness of four to s i x miles. Some of the
volcanoes are s t i l l active i n Iceland, 140 eruptions
having been recorded over the past 1,000 years.
With luck one of these volcanoes nay put on a show
for I.C. this suswier.
