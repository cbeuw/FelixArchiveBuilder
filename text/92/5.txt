Dear Sir,
As members of ths Panning Club ire view with horror and.
dismay the downward trend of Saturday night entertainment i n
ths Onion. We hare therefore sent a letter to tha Entertain-
ments Committee, a oopy of whioh is enclosed. We heps that
you will publish this in its entirety and so bring our
opinions to th* notice of your readers.
Tours faithfully,
T.C.Walls, president

Dear Sir,
We feel that within the last two years th* standards
of ths "bob hops" has reached an abominably low level.
In tha absence of a.band the "dancers" are provided with
noise from a mediocre selection of records whioh would
appear to be chosen on account of their brilliant vocal or
instrumental exposition rather than because of their
suitability for dancing. In sons cases these records are
excellent for jiving, but often i t i a impossible to
perform any recognised sequence of steps in time with them.
Surely most people would prefer to pay two shillings and
dance to the ihythm of a band!
Is ths objeot of the Entertainments Committee to
provide entertainment or to increase the Union's revenue?
If i t is the former they are at present falling miserably;
i f the latter they would be equally successful war* they
to have a band. The only explanation of th* present state
of affairs i s that the Committee do not devote sufficient
time to tha organising of th* "hops"
May we hope that i n th* future the informal dances
s i l l not disgrace the new Union buildings and that their
reputation will once again stand high in the University.
Tours faithfully,
T.C.Wells, President.
H.E.Espig, Hon. Secretary.

SPORT IN GERMANY
Our 'British' representative did not spend a l l his time
fostering Anglo-German relations informally. Besides ths.
divided nature of their oountry, the Germans showed much con
concern at signs of latent militarism. Th* following is from
S.A.K.'a report of ths oogress.
There i s one disquieting aapeot of German Universities,
especially prevalent i n the older ones such as Heidelberg.
This i s the existence of corporations, or fraternities, who
hold formal meetings in order to participate in a bloody type
of rapier fighting. Contestants stand face to face at a
fixed distance, with rapiers held pointing vertically,
with th* hand holding the rapier just in front of the nose.
Each contestant then tries to flick at his opponents head,
although he must not drop his hand below a certain level.
Th* rapiers are so thin and elastic that i t i s possible to
inflict severe outs i n the head and on the face, leaving
"soars of honour*. The most absurd rule ia that a combatant
is not allowed to take any evasive action at all. If he
knows the rapier i s on its way to hls'.hsad, he must stand
stock s t i l l to demonstrate his courage and manhood. Some-
times contestants are standing in a pool of blood before the
acknowledged time of the oombat has expired. These frater-
nities were founded at about the time of Napoleon, and i t i s
the custom of old students to return to fraternity meetings.
After th* war these fratsnities no longer existed, but were
revived by old students* It i s In such organisations that
many German students fear the spark of militarism or nation-
alism may again on* day rear its ugly head. In the large
modern universities, such fraternities are praotioalln non-
axiatant.
