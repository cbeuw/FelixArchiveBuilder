Indigo Girls and Balloon—
Mean Fiddler 28.10.92
Balloon are on stage. Two guys
typical of the classic folk-rock duo.
There's more fire about them live;
a bite that isn't captured on vinyl.
But no one seems to mind them
much; support is a raw deal. As
they leave, the Fiddler starts to fill
up with an uncharacteristic
Harlesden crowd. The young
Rhode Scholar types are having a
night out to hear one of their
homeside 'college' bands. As one
tells me, 'The Indigo Girls are big
in the States.' (Two million total
sales doesn't appear as proof of
largeness to most people though.)
Tonight, however, the domain of
the committed fan, they know it all
and more besides.
The Indigo Girls enter from the
left. Amy has visited the local army
surplus shop. She's sporting a blue
and gold brain dinner jacket. They
both look worn and well sorry girls,
overripe. In the flesh I'm not
impressed at this stage of the
proceedings. Greying hairs abound
and the excess baggage of touring
is starting to be evident. Still they
kick off briskly enough. The early
albums, 'Indigo Girls' and
'Nomads-Indians-Saints' are both
extensively aired and why not?
They certainly have a depth of
quality material it would be wasteful
to pass over.
These are songs to be handled
carefully, the sort that can seriously
damage your mind. The girls next
to me cheerfully mouth along with
them all. Yes, we're all your No 1
fans here, of course. But hold on;
think about what they're singing:
'Manic blood runs thick my
friend, are you looking for a clear
escape?'
T look a lot like narcissus, A dark
abyss of an emptiness...'
Can we take this kind of stuff
seriously without thinking about it?
This is not 'singalongalorralorra-
laughs' territory. People please
listen...
The girls are now storming
through their new album 'Rites of
Passage', 'Galileos head was on the
block, his crime was looking at the
truth...'
Hmmm, sometimes it hurts, so
we ignore it. In fact, we all
singalong at some stage in the
evening. But it's soon about time to
go, two hours on we've overstayed
our welcome. They finished with
'Close to Fire', the nearest thing
they have to an anthem: 'the less I
seek myself for some definitive, the
closer I am to fire...'

Inspiral Carpets, Real
People—Brixton Academy
The Real People were victims of the
scene that never happened. After
the success of the Manchester
bands, and the emergence of both
the La's and the Farm, A R men
rushed out to sign bands from
Liverpool in order to create a
parallel scene that subsequently
never materialised. The Real People
were one of those bands. One can
describe their sound as chunky,
driven by a strong rhythm section.
They update the sugar-sweet
harmonies of the Beatles with their
own brand of scouser rock. Tonight
though their sound seems lost in the
vast recesses of the Academy.
The Inspiral Carpets could never
really be called victims of a scene.
The truth is they never really fitted
in in the first place. Having
negotiated the difficult third LP, the
highly accomplished 'Revenge of
the Goldfish'. The choice selections
of which were played tonight.
'Witches Brew', the new single,
'Two Worlds Collide', 'Smoking
her Clothes' all from the new album
all seem instantly memorable.
Tonight though they play what
amounts to their Greatest Hits to a
highly appreciative audience.
Perhaps one of the unhippest bands
on the planet, the Inspirals do what
they do well. Why criticise them for
that?

Miss World The First
Female Serial Killer
The title track opens with Nick
Cave type vocals, bleak, dark and
cold; the fact that it's both
enlightening, depressing and
disturbingly unnerving makes it
incredibly mysterious, but so cool.
T am you' has an excellent faint
echo/backing vocal on it giving a
very spooky fuzzbox type effect,
reminiscent of King Crimson's
'Twentieth Century Schizoid Man',
but to a lesser and most appropriate
extent.
Unfortunately 'Dead Flowers'
ends up as a lemon filler track, with
nasty traces of corp-rock, absolute
trite.
However the last track 'Thief
inside' is an absolute classic, gentle
intro with seemingly looney vocals,
the tinkering ivories chill your spine
and the ending lyric of 'tap your
heels together three times' leaves
you completely gobsmacked. So
incredibly dire, it's brilliant. But
watch out it'll subtley erode your
sanity and believe me, I'm insane.
Great cover sleeve of a
precocious-looking little girl in tutu
etc as if she's ready to do 'Swan
Lake', but on a dark background
reflecting the general mood of the
record.
Not the best thing I've heard but
its unpretentious bleakness pulls it
through. If you've ever been
possessed by a dark psyche, then
this is for you...

Dwight Yoakam —La Croix
D'Amour
Dwight Yoakam is the man who
sings through his nose (absolute
nasal twang). He originally
appeared under the New Country
banner in the eighties with such
diverse acts as; k d lang, Nanci
Griffith, Steve Earle, and ten years
on remains closest to the country
folk in a tongue-in-stetson kind of
way. 'La Croix D'Amour' displays
something of his eclectic journey in
the meantime, consisting of a mix
of greatest hits and cover versions.
The latter includes 'Things we said
today' (Lennon/McCartney),
'Truckin" (Greatful Dead), Let's
Work Together', 'Suspicious
Minds', 'Here Comes the Night'
etc. Whilst most of these work, it
would be pretty hard to mess them
up. Anyhow, the fun of covers is
to vary them and Dwight doesn't
redefine this selection of favourites.
The ground is more shaky with his
own compositions. 'Long White
Cadillac' is a gem, perfectly
delivered in a setting of country
oppulence and heartbreak.
Unfortunately 'Dangerous Man'
and 'It Takes a Lot to Rock You',
are instantly forgettable despite the
presence of the Indigo Girls on
harmony vocals.
Overall, perhaps the variety is the
downfall; too much choice can be
a bad thing.
Tintin.
