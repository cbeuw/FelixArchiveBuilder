DramSoc at Work and Play
Life in DramSoc is far from quiet, from the big bangs of a pyrotechnic
workshop to the Edinburgh Fringe.
'If you hold one of these while
detonating it will take off your arm
- at least' says Andrew, DramSoc's
stage director, while he carefully
lowers a theatrical 'giant size'
maroon by its wires into an iron bin.
We are standing on the grid above
the stage of the Concert Hall
preparing the workshop on
pyrotechnics. Downstairs Mylan,
who will give the workshop, is
working chemical powders into
cigarette-like devices that will
produce discharges of coloured
flames.
The workshop begins with an
introduction to the various basic
components of pyrotechnics:
blackpowder, flashpowder,
magnesium, etc. and how they
produce certain effects. I have
never been very good with
chemicals, so I only understand
about half of it. It becomes
entertaining when Mylan sets fire
to some heaps of powder either by
blackpowder fuses or electrical
discharge. Flashes and different
coloured torches go off
accompanied by many sssshhhhes
and wouffs - very nice!
Then he demonstrates the
different effects that a small amount
of blackpowder can have. Just
poured onto the floor it burns away
rather uninterestingly. But from a
one foot gaspipe, sealed at one end,
you can blast a water filled condom
high into the air, sprinkling the
whole stage with drops (just in case
you ever feel the urge to advertise
condoms or are in need of a two
second 'rain'). One of the giant
maroons mentioned earlier
produces a 'real loud bang' and
attracts the undivided attention of
two police vans patrolling the
'Support The Miners'
demonstration. (The second maroon
sent two officers circling the Union
Building on foot, looking rather
worried.)
After explaining the basic
mechanisms of fireworks, how you
can make them produce nice pattern
of stars and so on, the audience is
invited to mix up their own special
effects, which filled the hall with
thick smoke and the session ended
due to bad lightl

All the workshops this term and
much much more
Another workshop organised by the
Dramatic Society took place on the
weekend of the 24th and 25th
October. This essentially consisted
of the setting up of a theatre in the
Union Dining Hall in which to
perform a play. It was similar to
Theatre West End (the venue run
during the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival). While the 'techies' were
busy building the theatre, the actors
rehearsed the one act play 'Ernie's
Incredible Illucinations'. This was
performed in front of an audience
on the Sunday.
More workshops of this kind will
probably be run, since this one
proved to be lots of fun for both
those interested in the technical
aspects of the theatre and those
interested in acting.
Watch out for posters or phone
3531 for more information. Better
still, why not come and visit us in
the DramSoc storeroom (4th floor
of the Union Building, east
staircase) any lunchtime, or join us
on Tuesday evenings in Da Vinci's.
And remember, during
December we will be staging
Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night', so if
you wish to help out with that, come
to • our production meetings on
Thursdays at 5.30pm in the Green
Committee Room (top floor of the
Union Building).
