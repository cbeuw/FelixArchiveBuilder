Rag Raid II
Fancy a day away from London
smog? Want to put some easy
money on your R A G total to take
you up to that next elusive
incentive? Then join R A G for one
of the easiest and most relaxing
collections of the year - Poppy Day.
On Saturday 8th November,
R A G will be taking a minibus full
of collectors down to Maidstone to
hand out lots of little red paper
flowers whilst the public shower
them with money, in aid of the
families of those who fought and
died for our country. What other
reason do you need?
Get yourself and your smile down
to Beit Arch by 8.30am tomorrow.
See you there!

So you think that handing out
poppies in Maidstone is far too easy
for the likes of you? Or were you
planning to spend all day in the pub
thinking about that urgent problem
sheet you have to do? No problem!
As those who took part in the Drink
a Pub Dry Challenge at the
beginning of term can vouch, R A G
and alcohol are far from
incompatible...in fact we were
thinking expressly of all you
drinkers out there when we planned
the Leukaemia Research Pub
Crawl.
So you can combine your two
favourite activities - quaffing and
collecting - this Saturday. Just meet
up at the R A G Office from 10am
onwards to pick up a can and
choose an area.
Last Saturday evening saw a
transformation take place in the
Union Building as the witching hour
drew near. If you noticed a
preponderance of basques, fishnets
and leather you were either in Earls
Court or in the R A G Rocky Horror
Disco.
The evening started with de-
virginising the Rocky Horror
virgins present (not quite as drastic
as it may sound) with the help of
rather a lot of whipped cream. This
was followed by the first showing
of the Rocky Horror Picture Show
film, which was repeated all night
in Da Vinci's. The rest of the night
was taken up with a disco until
1.00am featuring all the sort of
music you would expect at a
Hallowe'en disco. The dress code
was followed by a fair number of
Rocky Horror fans, so remember
for future R A G risky discos, you'll
look more ridiculous dressed
normally!
Off Your Tree
Pavement Climb
Last weekend saw yet another R A G
event for all you mad, crazy,
wonderful people, for this was the
weekend of the Pavement Climb.
One of our most daring and
dangerous stunts so far.
Congratulations to everyone who
courageously took up our challenge
to climb the pavement from the
Victoria and Albert Museum, past
Harrods and up to Hyde Park.
Despite temperatures that wouldn't
have been out of place on a
mountain top, a good turn out led
to a grand total of £973.00 being
raised for The Royal Association In
Aid Of Deaf People.
Battling against a sheer drop and
the constant danger of being
knocked off the face of the
pavement by passing pedestrians,
our brave climbers set off at 1 lam,
some tied together for safety, others
risking a solo climb. Several
climbers had close shaves but
fortunately just about everybody
made it to the summit before
nightfall with no more serious
injuries than a few grazed palms
and bruised knees.
Thanks to everybody who
participated, helping to make it a
great event, and well done. Prizes
will be handed out at today's R A G
meeting at 1.10pm to the lucky
winners of the best fancy/climbing
dress. Altogether a very successful
expedition.
