Wobs Hockey
Wobblers - IC Hockey 1st XI,
Men's 28.10.92
Without a doubt, not even a very
little one, it was team morale and
fitness that pulled us through in
Wednesdays' U A U match against
King's. Great vision on the through
balls and incredible execution inside
the 'D' gave us an early lead
(although they soon equalised)
A Testosterone-packed second
half led to a tense midfield struggle,
and lots of yellow cards. However
we always looked likely to break the
impasse and with our corruscating
set plays we scored a well deserved
second 'go-ahead' goal with only 10
minutes remaining.
We all held on to our huge loads,
with Simon ' G i n ' Curwood
performing well in goal and 'Muff
Diver' Higgin, in his last
appearence, doing well in defence.
Simon, for his storming
performance on the right wing, was
awarded our quacking mascot - the
eyeless duck called Blow Job. Our
teams goals aided our bid for U A U
champions.
An irate 2nd XI asked me to
correct the score published last
week. They scored twice in the first
15 minutes against King's and were
always the dominant side. The
result was IC 2nd XI 2 v 0 King's
College.
Rugby Wins
Imperial College Rugby First X V
Imperial College continued their
University Athletics Union (UAU)
winning way by beating Brunei
17-13 at Uxbridge.
The game started in hectic
fashion as IC conceded the
obligatory three point penalty five
minutes into the game.
They struck back on the twenty
minute mark with a slick handling
movement where Anton Fields put
Dave Bolton in for his first try of
the season. This was converted and
was followed by a period of heavy
pressure by the IC forwards,
culminating in a converted penalty
try when the Brunei pack dived in
the scrum to stop Simon Pearson
touching down. Another penalty by
Brunei brought the half to a close
with IC 14-6 up.
The second half was a scrappy
affair with Brunei narrowing the
deficit, with a converted try, to
14-13.
Debutante Mark Ashford
narrowly missed a drop goal before
Stuart Paynter kicked a penalty to
complete the scoring. George Habib
replaced Roger Gilchrist with ten
minutes to go and IC held on for a
hard fought win.
Imperial College Rugby Second X V
ICRFC 8 Brunei 5
At last the seconds earned the win
which reflects their efforts. Lead
from the centre of the scrum by
Captain Rich (Chunky) Cleniey, the
rest of the front row - Si Fuller and
Mark Jackson, had an excellent
game. Rucks and Malls were
powerfully won by the rampaging
John Cassidy and unstoppable Keith
Simpson on the flank complemented
by a powerful second row and
speedy number eight.
A try in the first ten minutes by Lee
Jefferson (unconverted) set the
precident for the rest of the game,
more trys were deserved but
unforthcoming. The penalty kick
was also taken by Lee's immaculate
boot. Unfortunately a try was
conceded in the last few moments,
but IC's relentless energy and effort
was finally payed off at the final
whistle.
The game was free flowing and
lovely Rugby to watch, a fitting
result considering our last few, hard
fought, defeats.

Sunday at 12, Monday at 6 and

Brunei v Imperial
At 12.45 there was panic as two of
our best players couldn't play. Two
reserves were quickly found. It
seemed as though, after a 15-2 win
in our first match (Mathias Stolpe,
Mark Green and Richie Lam all
unbeaten) we were now going to
struggle to win. However Mathias
kept his unbeaten record, Guy
Plowman scored 3/4 and Richie
Lam and Prakash Rajn each scored
2/4. Richie and Mathias added the
doubles for a more than satisfactory
12-5 win.

The Mestel Challenge took place on

Concert Hall. Dr Jonathan Mestel
took on thirty of IC's top players in
a simultaneous exhibition match.
The former British Champion put
up a spectacular display of violent
tactics and positional subtleties that
baffled most of his opponents,
earning him 23 wins, 6 draws and
1 loss. IC's only consolation victory
was scored by B Kluffinger of the
Physics department.
D Tang, P Duncan, G Knott, K
Wong, T Lee and B Birchell all
achieved creditable draws.
