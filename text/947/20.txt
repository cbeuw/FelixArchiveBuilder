The Last of the Mohicans
Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an
adopted Mohican (orphan of
massacred white settlers) who,
together with real Mohican
Chingachgook and son, Uncas,
happen to rescue Alice Munro
(Madeleine Stow), her sister and
Major Heyward (an English ally)
from a bloody ambush by the
.Hurons, an enemy tribe allied to the
French. They agree to escort them
to Fort Henry and, during this time,
Hawkeye and Alice fall in love.
Thus begins this 'romantic
adventure' set in the beautiful
Felix 947
countryside of Albany, New York
during the American war between
England, France and respective
native allies.
Although this film is shot in
widescreen format, Michael Mann
rarely seems to take advantage of
it. Most of the time we have either
close-up overacting or dizzy battle
scenes, even the panoramas are
'flat'. And the title is meaningless
- the plot is almost wholly centred
on the pseudo-Mohican Hawkeye,
with the man in question, Uncas,
barely getting a look-in. With the
extreme violence, the end result is
a ruralised version of Mann's
previous project - Miami Vice.

The Last of the Mohicans
Theatre
Hay Fever
Noel Coward's petty little comedy,
Hay Fever, examines, as is his
wont, the moires of polite society
and the chaos created when its
codes are broken. The play is
basically an extremely dilute and
trivial version of Shaw's Heartbreak
House—minus his masterly
dialogue and dramatic flair. The
central Bliss family cast off the
acceptable social veneer of the day,
replacing it with a strangely
endearing facade of pseudo
emotional extremes. They confuse,
ignore, embarrass, exasperate and
finally drive away their bemused
guests with an astounding mix of
indifference, mock arguments and
bursts of hamming. Though largely
confected, their excesses seem
strangely and refreshingly open in
contrast to their stiff-lipped, iceberg
guests.
An excellent cast led by the
sparkling Maria Aitken as the
fading dramatic diva Judith Bliss
just manages to cobble a worthwhile
evening from an essentially poor
play. Even for Coward, characters
are annoyingly cardboard, lacking
his customary, self-conscious wit
but valiant acting and directing
render them credible and amusing.
Once agin, see it for the acting.

You are now entering the cliche
zone...
Reminiscent of Alan Bennet
'Talking Head' piece, this
production is the video diary of a
mentally retarded janitor, subjected
to pioneering surgery to increase his
intelligence.
Once seated in the small theatre,
early scenes build the deeply
emotional atmosphere which grips
the audience throughout the play.
Mark Currie's performance is
nothing short of spectacular, a
virtuosic mix of movement and
speech show a deep understanding
of his subject matter. Mental
retardation, as with drunkeness is
very difficult to present credibly
without some farcical touches,
which would ruin this piece; this
never occurs—rare moments of
humour are inevitably followed by
Just Between Ourselves
There isn't very much to say about
the beginning—I simply missed it
(London traffic!).
According to what I had heard
about Alan Ayckborn I expected an
outrageous comedy, and had visions
of bursts of laughter all over the
place. There were actually some
quite funny scenes with birthday
cakes, D I Y , and accidental
stripping (however slight). But
although the four days portrayed,
were all birthdays, the nature of the
play is not half as cheerful as
expected and you can't really call
soul searching as to whether these
moments are funny, or are we
laughing at Charlie Gordon's
expense, the type of laughter he
comes to understand all too
painfully in the play. Conveying
perfectly Charlie's pain and
emotional upset, he leaves the stage
having dumped all the emotional
and moral questions squarely on the
audience's lap.
Interesting and intelligent lighting
coupled with very good direction
through potentially tedious, planer
soliloqueys. Pinteresque touches
and inventive use of the stark set by
the young director, show real
potential for the fledgling Tin Drum
Theatre Company.
You'd be a fool to miss this. One
point though, the theatre is
conveniently next to King's Cross
station, but is damn cold. So wrap
up warm and G O .

it black humour either. Even though
it's billed a comedy there is
something rather sad about the play
and this is not only because one of
the characters is actually
pathologically depressive. Much is
made of meaningless everyday
struggles; the selling of an
unpopular little, red, although
polished, car is definitely not the
most difficult task in life. Odd.
