I have been at Imperial tor just over
a month but I feel that I have
already experienced the ultimate
boring lecturer in the Biology
Department. No names will be
mentioned but suffice to it say he
could bore the arse of William
Roache alias Ken Barlow of
Coronation Street (according to the
Sun that is). Something has to be
done to liven him up and possibly
a few other lecturers as well.
Maybe if compulsory loud clothes
or the introduction of the choice to
rap were allowed then I wouldn't
feel the need for a 'Lecturer
Destruct Button' to be installed in
every seat in the lecture theatres.
With the American elections
over, I have been wondering what
it would be like if our general
elections were held in the same
superficial and muck-rakeing
manner. Personally, I would love
to see John Major, John Smith and
Paddy Pantsdown have a really
good slagging match instead of the
usually semi-satirical jabs they
inflict on each other while under the
control of Peter Snow or Brian
'speech defect' Walden. Pre-
election debates would look more
the old Saturday afternoon wrestling
bouts than the drab and boring
affairs that the British voters are
used to.
It is my opinion that women, in
general, are very secretive about the
running of their bodies, perhaps
because it is more complex than the
average male body. But, although
science unravels more day by day,
I cannot wait for the explanation of
why women are NEVER to be
heard farting in public, and are
rarely heard in private for that
matter. Maybe, they have a unique
adaption to their anus that hides the
smell and the sound or it could be
re-directed to their mouths where it
is discretely expelled while she
happily chats away, (at last a reason
for why women talk so much)!
It's near Christmas and that
means that soon there will be an
avalanche of adverts from every
major company in the land.
Nintendo and Sega will desperately
try to sell their shit machines to a
gullible public while Argos will
convince you that they can take care
of it. Tesco and Sainbury's will try
once again to out bid each other as
they slash prices and Allied will no
doubt announce the start of yet
F e l i x 9 4 7
another sale. But when have Allied
never had a sale? I'm sick of the
whole advertising charade that is
put on at Christmas. Don't panic,
I won't get all religious but I wish
that the advertisers would give a
warning before broadcasting their
few seconds of shit.
