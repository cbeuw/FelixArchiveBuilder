After enthusiastic press coverage,
few can be unaware of Imperial
College's possible breakaway from
the University of London. In the
academic world, many regard it as
the only way forward. Departments
would no longer have to undergo
lengthy validation processes
whenever course modifications are
required, staff appointments would
no longer have to go through
University administration. One
wonders why Imperial didn't break-
away years ago. Doubtless politics
are involved!
As a representative of the
students, my concern is whether
they will suffer as a result of the
Ents
split. Sabbaticals at the University
of London Union (ULU) are
worried about the future of U L U
should Imperial, L S E and U C L
split from the University. I believe
that U L U provide a valuable service
to our students. Our Union has a
very wide range of facilities, but
there are some things on offer at
U L U that we cannot provide.
I would appreciate some feedback
from Imperial College students. Do
you use facilities? Would you feel
deprived if they were no longer on
offer? Write to me in the Union
Office, phone me on 3502 or simply
pop in for a chat.
Rick Bilby, ICU DP.

The more observant and regular
reader may have noticed the lack of
column inches donated on my part
recently and the otherwise general
absence of my bit. This is mainly
due to the fact that the editor is a
fascist and 12.30pm Monday
lunchtime is outside the realms of
my imagination. (Hideous slander!
I will not stand for it! The deadline
is lpm-Ed)
But so on to business. For a run
down of events this week, peruse
the What's On column. As ever it's
all free apart from Friday night
which, for Atmosphere and a bar till
lam is only a £1 on the door, and
you can't say fairer than that.
The TVs are now fitted and
working in Da Vinci's, showing
M T V lunchtimes and big sporting
events on Satellite as they occur.
Today is also the first Union
General Meeting (UGM) at 1pm in
the Concert Hall. This is your first
chance to wave those Union cards
and ask delicate and sensitive
questions. Please try and make it,
if only out of curiosity and to stop
someone shouting 'Quorum'
(translation: there's not enough
people here, so why bother?).
In conclusion, please use your
Union facilities to the full. That's
what they're there for, and tell your
friends!
That one and only
UGM motion-in full
ICU notes:
i) that the government plans to close
the majority of British coal
production
ii) that the Observer newspaper
estimates that the immediate cost of
this will be £8 billion.
ICU believes:
i) that this is only one part of a
disastrous government strategy
which is putting millions on the dole
ii) that miners cannot be left to fight
alone
iii) that the Tories are weak and
divided and can easily be beaten
ICU resolves:
i) to support the miners in all
possible ways
ii) to organise a boycott of academic
and sporting activities on the
afternoon of Wednesday 21 October
iii) to support the march and lobby
of parliament on Wednesday
ICU instructs the executive to
publicise this and future activities
in support of the miners campaign
to keep the pits open.

What is there to do tonight, you say
scratching your head and noticing
that appetising piece of Edam over
in the corner. Well there is
Sunscreem at the Marquee; no too
expensive; stay in and watch 'The
Word', no, too boring; carefully
place assorted fireworks into your
various orifices, no, too dangerous
(Note: Don't try this at home kids);
or even get the video of all the
Changing of the Guards at the
Palace for the last ten years, no,
save this for a special occasion.
So, the only alternative is the
Union, but don't despair there is a
good night planned here on Friday
night (tonight).
The main band is Cygnet Ring.
They were described in one of the
more popular music weeklys as
'only band named after a part of a
ducks arse can't be all that bad' and,
frankly who am I to argue!! Apart
from this the rest of the music press
including Felix (we're not worthy!)
have given them rave reviews. So,
if you are a lover of that sort of
rocky, raggly, taggly,
Wonderstuff/Levellers sound then
I'm sure your destiny lies in the
Lounge on Friday.
The very special guests are just
that! I won't say too much about
them except they are a quite
outstanding four piece from London
with a rosy and promising future,
their name Livingstone (I presume),
definitely an act for music lovers
everywhere to relish and enjoy.
The whole evening will
commence at 8pm and apart from
the two bands there will be a bar
extension, some bar promotions and
of course that ever-so-good (it's
Ebeneezer Goode!) disco that will
be kickin' it L A R G E until
ever-so-late.
Tickets are available in advance
from the Union Office, on the first
floor of the Union Building, priced
£2.50. Ents card holders can pick
them up for just £1.50 and anyone
else can buy some on the door for
£3.00. As in all the Atmosphere
gigs there is a no-readmission door
policy.
