Opt out response
Prices Rises
by the Editor and News Staff
The break up of the University of
London is underway. Sir Eric Ash,
Imperial's Rector, yesterday
announced the setting up a
committee to investigate Imperial's
future in the federation. The
committee will be established
within the next few days, and no
indication has been given as to its
possible membership. The
committee will be asked to examine
the possibility of a separation from
the University of London.
The announcement follows the
Rector's much flagged
Commemoration Day speech in the
Royal Albert Hall on 22 October,
when Sir Eric questioned the
efficiency and effectiveness of the
federal structure. 'Our faith in the
ability of the university to deal
efficiently and equitably with
college business has been stretched,
sometimes to near breaking point
and occasionally beyond', he said.
Sir Eric's speech has caused
much bitter reaction. Professor
Stewart Sutherland, Vice
Chancellor of the University of
London, has criticised the 'fact of
life that a dramatic announcement,
be it fact or fancy, will always grab
the headlines where steady progress
never does.' Writing in yesterday's
London Student, Professor
Sutherland added that 'there is no
such thing as a conscript amongst
the Schools in the University, only
volunteers'. He also defended the
status and purpose of the
University. 'If any School is
convinced that federal involvement,
including the right to award a
University of London degree, is no
longer beneficial then it should
make a clear decision either to take
a full part or opt out', wrote
Professor Sutherland.
The Imperial speech has also
provoked some institutions to
reconsider their own position within
the federal structure. Professor
Graham Zellick, of Queen Mary
Westfield College, said last week
that while Q M W was content to
remain within the federation, they
will 'follow developments
elsewhere closely so that we can
react quickly to any changes'.
Professor Zellick also said that
Q M W was 'a university in
everything but name'. Q M W was
one of seven larger London
institutions which last year joined
Imperial in financial independence
from the University of London,
Professor David Roberts, Provost
of University College London
(UCL), said that it was not certain
that Imperial would leave the
federation. 'Eric Ash isn't
divorcing from the University, he
is merely exploring what needs to
be done', he said. Professor Roberts
said that there are two ways of the
University of London dealing with
an Imperial defection. Either U C L
and other colleges would leave
along with Imperial, or the
University of London could amend
its structure to encourage colleges
to remain in the federation. The
Council of King's College has yet
to discuss the matter, but in a
statement, they said there were still
major benefits in remaining in the
federation.
Huge price rises have been
proposed for the Imperial College
Sports Centre when it re-opens next
January.
The centre is to introduce an 'on'
and 'off peak system, whereby
prices rise and fall depending on the
time of day, and the day of the
week. The facilities of the gym,
swimming pool and new sauna and
Health Suite are to be charged
separately". Additional price
changes mean that a three month or
term pass to the sports centre will
cost up to £16. This compares to a
cost of £25 for the whole of the last
acauciiiic year.
Caroline Osner, the Imperial
College Sports and Leisure
Manager refused to comment on the
proposed price rises, but said any
changes would take place on the
principle of separating the charges
for facilities. She said this would
mean that people using the gym
would not be charged for use of
swimming
Ms Osner continued that any
changes in prices would first have
to be passed by South Kensington
Facilities User Advisory Group,
which will meet on Wednesday 11th
November.
Warning
by staff reporters
Students are warned that due to a
Remembrance Day ceremony in the
Albert Hall, they many face
problems with security this
weekend. Any bicycles left chained
up on Prince Consort Road will be
removed by police, and 'disruptive'
students entering or leaving the
Union in the evening may be
arrested. Deputy President Rick
Bilby warned students 'not to make
too much noise leaving the union or
they might get nicked'. The
ceremony will be attended by a
number of senior politicians and
members of the Royal Family.
