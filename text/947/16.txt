Espiritu: Who owns the Renault 4? Stop sniggering woman, you'll give it away.
Biohazard—Urban Discipline
Biohazard have either sold out or
seen the light, depending on your
point of view. I'm no hardcore
purist, so I wholeheartedly approve
of the metal influences on this
album. Overkill, Sepultura and
Pantera all get a mention on the
sleeve.
So what? You cry. What
hardcore band doesn't end up
playing metal? Well, very few do
it this proficiently.
The lyrical content is typically
N Y M C , that Brooklyn accent
raging against the shit things in
life—politicians, crooked cops, etc.
'Black and White and Red All
Over' should put paid to the
rumours about Biohazard's
racism—this album will not tolerate
fascists, or indeed any other bad
people.
If you like metal tinged with
hardcore, or vice-versa, then you
should buy this album. It is brutal,
powerful and very, very good.

Espiritu—Fransisca
Now this really is a dilemma.
The release of this record finally
chronicles the demise of the finest
group of the late eighties, the
formidableFrazier Chorus, brought
on by the disintegration of Virgin
Records, in which the mighty EMI
dropped all their good artists (Stand
up, That Petrol Emotion), and kept
Phil Collins. The fact that Virgin
couldn't break a new band into the
charts was the subject of numerous
industry jokes, despite having one
of the best rosters in the business.
Beautiful People—Foxey
Lady
'Hey, foxy lady', it worked for
Jimi, he could make that song live
like no one else can, so a remake
of it is a very daring thing to do.
Or possibly, it's just a commercial
trap to trick you into listening to the
record and buying it (or vice-versa).
I wouldn't (buy it that is, you can
listen to it if you want though), it's
not that it's bad, just average, and
average just doesn't cut it with
remakes. The track, it is fair to say,
is very different from the original,
So endeth the first lesson.
And now one of them is back,
with a new group, a new label, a
new sound. The group, Espiritu, the
label, Heavenly, believe in magic,
the sound, a Spanish sort of groove.
Considering their parentage,
slightly disappointing, but to be
compared to Frazier Chorus is a
trifle unfair. They were gods, and
this is just another extraordinary
Heavenly release.

• Out now on Heavenly/Columbia.
it is more like a new song
influenced by Hendrix with sample
sounds from the man himself. I just
didn't feel right, an O K B side
maybe. The other song on the EP
is far more interesting, still
Hendrixy (and again some sampled
stuff) but not reheated stuff. Again
it didn't blow my mind (but then,
it's quite hard to blow) but it had
more potential. I still want to WAIT
and see (that's listen)...

The Poor Boys —Pardon Me
Pardon me indeed, M r Poorboy.
For those who don't read reviews
in their entirity here's a summary:
L A . Rock. Enough said? Well for
those still reading, the initial
offputter on this album is the cliche
mandatory moody photo pose on
the back cover. Wota bunch of
tosspots, they look most suspect and
non-triumphant. Indeed the picture
of the pig on the front cover is
interesting though...One final gripe
about the packaging is the ego trip
photo collage in the little C D
booklet, so hypocritical. At one
extreme they're portrayed as gentle
caring Move my baby' men, at the
other extreme they are real men
who drink non-stop and have
copious amounts of rock chicks.
Y U K ! But I hear you cry what
about the music! True, the
packaging shouldn't affect my view
of the music but it doesn't help a lot.
Well, we start with 'Hey Man',
the first song on the album
(naturally enough). Although it is
similar to material made by every
band (almost every band then) in
L A , it is quite good. The biggest
virtues are the reasonably fast,
punchy tempo coupled with the
length being short enough to
prevent it becoming boring. Good
stuff for a single perhaps. 'Can't get
you back' carries on from 'Hey
Man' and in many respects for all
purposes might as well be titled
'Hey Man'. 'Guilty' is the standard
rock ballad everyone expects from
L A groups after success from bands
such us Poison, Cinderella, Faster
Pussycat and countless other minor
acts. It is the usual 'sit around' with
acoustic guitars routine that bores
me eternally.
'Love and Faith' is INXS and
Poison rolled into one. 'Shine' is
not worth a mention, so I won't.
'No Real Emotion' is unnerving
because the name of this song
reflects on the content of this album.
It's all so false with the typical 'I
love you baby' and 'If you go I'll
wither and die painfully' type
lyrics.
'Brand New Amerika' is atypical
of the album. For the first and only
time on this recording you can hear
a bass guitar not following a drum
or guitar line but actually
participating creatively. Alas the
illusion is shattered with 'Make
Your Move'.
This leaves me to mention the last
song 'Don't Need You Around'
which is prophetic because we don't
want you around, Poorboys. There
are other songs on the album but
because they all sound the same I'm
not going to mention any O K .
