6 November 1992 Felix 947
IC Boat Club
Many IC students will be unaware
that the 1991/2 season was one of
the Boat Club's most successful
ever. As has been previously
reported in Felix, the 1st eight
defended its Japanese Henley title
and all the club enjoyed wins on the
domestic circuit. The pinnacle of
this success was at Henley Royal
Regatta, which occurred after the
end of term in July. It is every
oarsman's ambition to compete and
succeed at Henley and this year
Imperial had five crews entered: IC
1st eight in the prestigious Ladies
Plate, IC 2nd eight in the Temple
Challenge Cup for colleges and
non-collegiate universities
worldwide, four 'novice' oarsmen
in the Visitors Cup for students and
other members of the top squad in
the Thames Cup for Club eights and
the Wyfold Cup for fours. These
two latter crews met with stiff
opposition early on and went out by
narrow margins on the Wednesday
and Thursday respectively, victims
of the sudden-death nature of the
event.
Meanwhile, the four members of
the novice squad were showing
determination and maturity belying
their relatively brief involvement in
the sport by reaching the semi-final
stage at the weekend. All of this
crew were members of the Novice
eight, having learnt their rowing at
IC, who gained the novice pennant
at the Tideway Eights Head in
March, part of the club's record 4
total wins, unequalled by any
rowing club previously. The
Temple Challenge Crew had a
tough draw, the Henley stewards
having decided not to seed them.
Thus, they faced three selected
(seeded) crews in order to reach the
final. They served notice of their
intention by breaking the record to
Fawley in the first day of racing,
beating last year's winners Bristol
University on the Thursday and the
highly favoured Nihon University,
Japan, on the Friday. The 1st eight
showed class in defeating Thames
Tradesmen and completed
Imperial's unprecedented trio of
semi-finalists.
The four bowed out with honour
on Saturday morning, losing to the
eventual winners Durham
University but covering a little more
than 1 mile 550 yards of the course
in the process! IC 2nd eight had a
strong row managing to conserve
energy in defeating Tufts
University, U S A . IC 1st eight also
made no mistakes in despatching the
Australian National Development
Squad eight, rowing as Victoria
Rowing Club.
Finals day dawned dull and
overcast and the first race of the day
was Imperial's Temple Challenge
clash with their old rivals the Irish
Champions, Trinity College
Dublin, umpired by the regatta
chairman Peter Coni. As the crews
paddled up to the start the empty
stands in the enclosures started to
fill and nerves were heightened by
familiar faces shouting
encouragement. This eight was only
settled less than two weeks before
races began after fiercely
competitive trials and their quickly
gained self-confidence lay in pieces
as they found themselves more than
a length down with just over two
minutes of the race remaining, their
supporters listening in horror to the
impassive commentary on the
official Tannoy, the crew victims of
Trinity's relentless pace. But
coxwain Alice Codrington of St
Mary's Hospital, implored her
engine room to make the favourites
pay for their early efforts. Her
words stung the rowers into greater
action just before they were
drowned out by a wall of sound
emptying from the now packed
grandstands. Imperial dug deep
within themselves and seemed to
find another gear mounting a final j
breathtaking sprint that brought the
two crews level with only a few
strokes remaining. At this point the
Irish Crew knew they could not win
and IC went past to cross the line
into immortality. The record was
smashed by seven seconds and the
eight's jubilation was only matched
by Trinity's grace in defeat.
The 1st eight arrived at the course
over an hour later to face the
challenge of ASR Nereus from
Amsterdam, containing lightweight
world medalists. Finding
themselves in a similarly desperate
situation at halfway stage, they once
again rose to the encouragement of
the many Imperial supporters and
worked their way back from nearly
a length deficit to a few feet as they
approached the last metres of the
course. Unfortunately in the tension
and excitement the crew was
steered off their all-important line
and could not gain a lead, though
catching the Dutch students with
every - stroke and pouring every
ounce of effort into the surge for the
line. As the crews crossed it the
screams and shouts faded to an
unbearable silence as the finish line
umpires analysed the photo finish.
After what seemed an age the
anticipation was ended by the result:
'a dead heat', with a re-row
scheduled three hours hence, for
only the second time in the 153-year
history of the regatta. The Imperial
camp, however, was quietly
confident that the months of hard
winter training would tell and sure
enough as the crews came into sight
of the home straight for the second
time, the London Students had
gained the upper hand and
dominated the race from early on,
establishing a powerful rhythm
which held them through a
determined final push by Nereus, to
record a staggering second win for
Imperial. Even more noteworthy
was the manner of their victory: the
dead-heat was rowed in a time of
6 minutes 3 seconds the second-
fastest time the course has ever been
covered in and faster than the
winning time of the Grand
Champions, University of London,
recently heavily featured in the U L
press.
This represents a remarkable
achievement and is a tribute to their
dedication which goes unnoticed by
most students at the college. Even
more so, the Club's Boatman and
Chief Coach Bill Mason who
masterminds all the successes from
Novice to Henley Champions must
be congratulated for his inspiration
and guidance. The 1st eight and Bill
were further honoured by being
selected to form the basis of the
Great Britain under-23's eight
which raced at the Nation's Cup in
Strathclyde. They unfortunately had
a collision in a heat and were unable
to realise their full potential in the
final.
The club is very grateful to
Satelcom based in Silwood Park for
their continued sponsorship which
helped with the great expense of
equipping and repairing these crews
for competition.
This coming season sees almost
all these oarsmen returning to the
hard grind of endurance training to
further the club's elite status
together with a large influx of new
members both beginners and
experienced internationals. Felix
will be carrying news of all the
events and charting the progress of
our crews.
Report
IC Boat Club started its 1993 season
with some encouraging recent open
wins. On October 25 at Upper
Thames Small Boat's Head at
Henley they took the Senior II Quad
Sculls title and the following
Sunday the local Chiswick to
Hammersmith Janousek Fours
Head brought victory for two
coxless and two coxed fours from
6 IC boats. This boads well for this
term's main event, the Fours Head
on November 7th at which all these
crews and others will be racing. IC
coach Bill Mason expects the club
to continue its impressive record of
success in this event.
