This week saw the opening meeting
of the University of London
General Union Council (GUC).
G U C is the senior decision
making body of U L U , and as such
is attended by representatives of all
the London colleges, including
Imperial, who sent four delegates
including Chris Davidson, ICU
President.
The major debate was a motion
to prevent U L U from carrying out
illegal Ultra Vires activities, in the
wake of legal action against other
unions which had resulted in
substantial personal expense to
union officers. The motion was
passed after a short debate.
however, turned out to be a false
alarm. According to security,
'certain identified flaws' in the
security system have come to light
as a result of the alert. Steps are
now reportedly being taken to
improve the system.
Also in the meeting, the post of
Accommodation and Halls Officer
and a place on the Committee on
Student Activities and Management
were elected. A Postgraduate and
Mature Students Officer was not
elected as the candidate standing
lost to 'Reopen Nominations' the
U L U equivalant of 'New Election'.
Subjects not discussed at the
meeting was the matter of colleges
disaffiliating from the University of
London, and Voluntary
Membership which are considered
by many Senior members of U L U
to be the most pressing matter
facing the union.

Professor Roy Anderson, the head
of Imperial's Biology Department,
has announced his resignation. He
will leave on 30 September 1993 to
take up a new post as Linacre
Professor of Zoology at Oxford
University. Sir Eric Ash, College
Rector, is to begin consultations on
his successor.
Professor Anderson was born in
1947 and graduated in zoology at
Imperial in 1968. A noted AIDS
and HIV expert, he is also director
of the Welcome Research Centre
for Parasitic Infections, based at
South Kensington. The Centre,
established with a £ 4 million grant
from Welcome, has six staff and
fifty post-doctoral researchers.
Professor Anderson is also visiting
professor at the Institute of
Parasitology at University of
McGill, and has been invited this
week to give the 1994 Royal
Society's Croonian Prize Lecture.
Colleagues in Imperial's Biology
Department have congratulated
Professor Anderson on his
appointment, with some expressing
regret at the move. He has
previously worked at Oxford as an
IBM Research Fellow, and replaces
Sir Richard Southwood, the current
vice chancellor of Oxford. Sir
Richard will continue to hold a
personal chair in the Zoology
Department.
In other announcements,
Professor David Blow, Head of the
Department of Physics, has been
elected as a Membre Associe
Etranger of the Academie des
Sciences in Paris. Speaking to
Felix, Professor Blow described the
appointment as 'an unexpected
honour' that he was 'proud to
have'. He added that he had done
some considerable work in France,
and he thought that he had been
proposed for the membership by
those who were aware of his work
and wanted to 'show some
appreciation for it'.
GUC Report
Department denies Tomlinson to be shelved
by Declan Curry
The Department of Health has
refused to comment on claims that
part of the Tomlinson report is to
be shelved as a result of public
spending negotiations. David
Blunkett, Labour's Shadow Health
Secretary, said that he is
'pessimistic' about government
plans to invest in basic family
doctor health care. 'If anything
happens at all, it's going to be
closure rather than reinvestment',
he said. A spokesman for the
Department of Health said that they
had 'no comment to make on the
matter'.
The Tomlinson Report was
drawn up by Sir Bernard Tomlinson
after a year long inquiry into the
provision of health care in London.
The main recommendations of the
256 paragraph report are the closure
of St. Bartholomew's, Charing
Cross and Queen Charlotte's
Hospitals. The University College
Hospital and the Middlesex
Hospital are to be 'downsized', with
both hospitals merging on one site.
The Royal National Throat, Nose
and Ear Hospital and the Hospital
for Tropical Diseases will both be
closed and their functions
transferred to the new University
College - Middlesex Hospital.
Facilities at Bart's Hospital are to
be transferred to the Royal London
Hospital site. St. Thomas's and
Guy's Hospitals will also be merged
onto one site.
The number of beds at St. Mary's
Hospital will be reduced and part
of the site sold. The Royal
Brompton and Royal Marsden
Hospitals are to be rationalised and
relocated on to the current Charing
Cross site. Special Health
Authorities (SHA), which cover
specialist hospitals such as Great
Ormond Street Hospital for Sick
Children, will be rationalised and
opened to the health service internal
market. SHAs were created to
provide a level of shelter from the
free market until the hospitals were
deemed ready to openly compete
for patients.
The Tomlinson Report also calls
for 'better primary and community
health care' to accompany the
rationalisation of the hospital sector.
After publishing his report, Sir
Bernard Tomlinson said that 'there
needs to be a shift in the focus of
health services in London.
Insufficient attention is paid to the
health services delivered in the
community by GPs, health visitors
and others. More money needs to
be put into improving GPs premises
and into boosting the work of
primary health care teams.' This
development of primary family
doctor services has been costed at
£140 million, though independent
experts expect the final total to be
three or four times that. It is this
expenditure which is being
squeezed in the current government
spending round, the tightest for
many years. Economists have
warned ministers not to cut the level
of capital (building) spending in a
bid to end the recession.
The Tomlinson report was
welcomed by the British Medical
Association (BMA) and by London
Regional Health Authorities. Dr.
John Chawner, chairman of the
BMA's Consultants' Committee,
said 'the problems of over-
provision in London have been
apparent for some time' and added
that closures needed to be
implemented 'in a planned way, not
as a result of the market'. T am
quite certain that some consultants
will fight but we won't join that
fight', said Dr. Chawner. Virginia
Beardshaw, the director of
independent health think tank,
King's Fund London Initiative, said
that the closures would lead to
'better services', and condemned
the 'propaganda war' over the
recommendations.
Another of Tomlinson's
proposals is to merge London's nine
medical schools onto four sites.
Medical education at Imperial is to
be expanded with the addition of
Charing Cross Westminster
Hospital Medical School, the
Institute of Cancer Research, the
National Heart and Lung Institute
and the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School. The Executive Committee
of Imperial's Governing Body have
expressed their approval of the
recommendations. In a statement,
they say that the 'planned final
phase of redevelopment of St.
Mary's is sound', and welcome the
proposals 'to enlarge medicine
within the College by fully
integrating St Mary's with the
Charing Cross and Westminster
School to form a new Imperial
School of Medicine'.
The Tomlinson report has been
denounced by left wing pressure
group London Health Emergency
(LHE). John Lister, Information
Director of L H E , said that they
were working on a 'detailed
response' to the report, and that he
was pleased by the 'localised
campaigns' against the closures. M r
Lister added that there had been a
'massive public response' to the
L H E Health Hotline, with members
of the public phoning on 081 543
5914 for a free information pack.
