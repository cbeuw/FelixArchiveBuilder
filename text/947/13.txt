A tall, dark man with a drawn face
and unkept, wild, wiry black hair
is dithering about his door next to
my room. He invites me in and I
perch on his bed, not wanting to
appear as if I'm staying long. He

speaks only Turkish and we
converse entirely in sign language
and with maps, guide books and
diagrams. He begins with a
disturbing charade of death,
stabbing himself repeatedly in the
chest.
I am tired and slow to understand.
Frustrated, he takes a fruit knife and
begins to scratch a picture of some
mountains and the sun on the table,
putting round holes in the mountain
peaks. Inside the holes he places
crosses and then re-inacts the death
scene. I understand cemetery and
confirm the word with my
dictionary. The graves are at Ozalp,
some 80 kilometres east of Van.
Holding his clenched hands to his
eyes and looking through, I guess
that he has seen the deaths of these
people and assume that they are
Kurds. When I tell him, he grows
angry and grabs the map again,
pointing to Armenia and stressing
the size of the victims. Clasping his
wrists and fingers, he mimes
bracelets and rings. Using the
dictionary, I learn this is gold and
he hints that it is decorating the
corpses in their mountain tombs. He
seems to want money for the gold,
and implies that he needs my help
to exhume the bodies. It is late and
I make excuses to leave.
'Tomorrow.. .tomorrow,' he
repeats, excitedly gesturing to
Ozalp on the map.
'Tommorrow...Istanbul,' I reply
apologetically and stumble
backwards out of the door.
Coming soon in Felix; Chris Riley recalls his travels over the Atlas mountains
in Morocco, in the epic, 'On a Bike and Prayer'.
