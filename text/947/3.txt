Editorial
When I first came to Imperial, I
swore that I would not become a sad
hack. Having become a Felix hack,
sad or otherwise, I still hold one
group of people in utter contempt.
If I try and imagine explaining
their activities to a stranger to the
College it would go something like
this; This is group of people who
go around trying to steal large
lumps of metal from other people
while at the same time trying to
protect their own lump of metal. It
is called mascotry.
What is so distressing about this
seemingly trivial activity is the
characteristics it brings out in those
involved. The activities of the
mascoteer take over the life of the
poor individual. He cannot talk
about anything else, he develops
strange antagonisms to people he
has never met before. And he will
risk life and limb to save his
precious mascot from harm.
Alarmingly, a more sinister side
can emerge, Rambo-esque
tendencies evolve and outbreaks of
violence to protect the worthless tin
can occur. Last year a student of
Imperial had his leg crushed by a
car in just such an incident. It is
common knowledge that frequent
damage occurs to doors, walls, cars
and even people during mascotry
events.
It is not as if the College crawls
with mascoteers, but still it rules the
conversation of every member of
the C C U s . Broadsheet and
Guildsheet, the RCS and City and
Guilds' rags, lovingly devote pages
to this inane sport. Never has so
much been done by so few to so
little effect.
But what is the motivation? They
raise money for charity, is the
immediate reply. What other events
could be used to help out good
causes, let us try kidnapping the
Felix 947
Queen Mother, and ransom her
back for UNICEF, See how many
sponsored murders we can commit
in a week, all for a good cause!
Surely there are better and more
responsible ways of raising money.
My advice to those four freshers
who stole the King's Mascot is get
out while you can. Mascotry is not
worth the contempt the rest of the
College will heap on you if you
continue down this twisted path.
Security
Due to a bad choice of words in last
week's Felix I appear to have
offended many members of
Imperial College's excellent
Security Staff. I fully agree that
Security dealt with the incident in
the story in a correct and sensitive
manner. I am reluctant to offend
members of College Staff who work
hard enough as it is, without being
attacked by students. The comment
was in no way directed at those

members of Security who actually
deal with the safety of ordinary
students.

Do we really need one of the richest
women on earth signing a few
papers here and there by formality,
waving to crowds of tourists,
travelling where propaganda agents
think it a good idea? Do we need
this mediatic reminder of the glory
of a fallen colony-exploiting
empire?
Is the royal family there to give
the masses gossipy front-page
Val Straw
Security
Dear Editor,
The two latest issues of Felix
have featured stories about the
reported knife attack in Linstead
Hall, alleging that there has been a
security cover-up. May we assure
you that that is certainly not the
case. The Security Department's
only concern has been to establish
the facts of what has obviously been
stories? It certainly is doing very
well so far; no need to think up new
soap-opera scenarios, just follow
one or the other of the princesses.
Virtuous noble blood sets standards
for people of the Empire. It seems
to work well, if you look at the state
of families all over the
Commonwealth countries today.
And I'm sure we all would like to
speak and have table manners just
like our noblest coin-figures.
OK, so they are not there to set
social standards. Maybe to inspire
pride in our country or as symbols
of stable rule? Reminders of how
monarchy built the world? Just ask
some non-European Common-
wealther what he thinks of his pride,
those symbols, or the death of his
replies on
a very distressing incident. Further
police investigations are being
carried out and the matter is still sub
judice- However, any additional
information which could be given
to Security on this case would be
welcomed and would be treated in
strictest confidence.
Yours faithfully,
Val Straw, Facilities Manager.
ancestors for the crown!
Commanders of the armed forces
or heads of the Church? Sure, they
are obviously the most qualified
'choice'...
Honestly, do you think it's a life
to be born with a bright future as
a spoiled symbol? These souls
randomly incarnated as blue-
blooded have no right to express
political or other opinions beyond
their own bedroom, into which they
can't even take who they want.
They can't take a step outside
without bodyguards, photo-
graphers, scandal vultures or
souvenir-hunting tourists swamping
them. They can't afford to have
spots, scars or mud on their
trousersâ€”all that's not very
photogenic.
Well, we're probably keeping
them because they sell papers,
attract tourists and the masses, keep
some people working, give
something to put on stamps or
coins, offer a false sense of stability
to age-old institutions...They'
possibly couldn't get much of a job
otherwise.
I know how tiring it is to write
a whole new constitution for a
democracy in our century, but that
could make a few politicians useful
for a change.
Do the royalty a human favour-
throw them out.
