LSD the
Dear Jonty,
I'm glad some people made the
effort to read up on LSD following
my few lines in 'Beit Back' of Felix
944.
The Encyclopedia Britannica,
which I had, by the way, looked up
before they had offers the same
article on L S D it offered several
decades ago, just as poor and loaded
with 'may', 'might', 'could'
statements. The lab studies it refers
to were not carried out on humans,
and included (say, did they forget
to mention it in the new editions?)
looking into the effects of caffeine,
aspirin and other common drugs on
mousegenomes. The evidence tends
to point out that massive and
systematically applied doses of
these substances do help mouse
cells to mutate. (Which they do
unaided about every five minutes
anyway.)
For humans, a major factor in
such mutations is tight jeans, which

keep the temperature of gonads
unnaturally high. Most other
influences are comparatively very
weak. Since LSD in humans is anti-
addictive (an average dose will
produce no effect after two or three
days of taking it, with return to
normal after about a week),
excessive use of the substance is
virtually impossible.
About the moods and feelings
involved, everything said and its
opposite is true.
By the way, I have no sympathy
for a moron who takes acid on his
own for 'kicks' then beats up some
victim when in some nightmare
sequence of a trip, however awful
it is. Some shits like that sometimes
use the drug as an excuse of what
they did. Let me remind you that
LSD rarely effects people to this
point and if it does there must be
someone with them they can't pick
on.
I am against selling the stuff in
coffee shops or pharmacies, but I
replies
believe there is no reason not to use
it under medical supervision (even
for 'kicks') in special centres.
Please try to read accounts of
clinical tests such as Stafford and
Golightly's 'LSD: the problem-
solving psychedelic', (but also Tim
Leary's 'Politics of Ecstasy' to see
a fanatic's sensible argumentation).
To know more about trips, read
Aldous Huxley books (trips on
mescaline) such as 'The Doors of
Perception' to see how they change
lives and minds, listen to The Doors
(the echo here is not by chance),
Pink Floyd, The Beatles ...or maybe
Nirvana.
I here confirm I have not had a
drug-induced 'trip' yet, though
possibly some other types that a lot
of religious people claim they know
the meaning of (bullshit to me).
I am conscious of some long-term
mental effects of LSD, but they are
not all that bad as some may wish
to have others believe. (Quite on the
contrary—read about religious
leaders taking a drug and being
followed up several years
scientifically in Stafford &
Golightly's book which also had
two prefaces by high authorities in
Canadian psychology research).
INFORMATION is my concern,
and if my article lacked some
(voluntarily), I'm glad it initiated a
debate in this otherwise very
apathetic college. If you feel
satisfied with your mental,
emotional and spiritual life, if you
don't want these new powerful
experiences (or are in some way
afraid)—then D O NOT take L S D ,
as it can be dangerous for the
unprepared or reticent.
But don't ever try to keep me
from altering my consciousness if
I do it sensibly and in the way of
a pacifist.
I appreciate the 'concern'.

Theft
Dear Jonty,
This week started as a good
week, quite a rare feeling to have
on a Monday evening. Things were
going well, people were being
friendly, work was ticking over and
there was a great sunset.
Then it happened, a good chat in
Da Vincis, a laugh with friends
reveling in a good atmosphere, but
unbeknown to me, my bag (left with
others) had gone, in a bar full of,
so I thought, similar individuals.
One of whom thought they liked the
look of a grey Jaguar sports bag.
Perhaps they thought it's bulk
would be explained by rolls of fifty
pound notes, or gold ingots. Who
knows?
Next day, the realisation that the
bar staff hadn't picked it up and the
feeling of inevitable impending
hassle. Library books lost, manuals,
wallet. Not a good day, in fact a
s**t day.
In a world so riddled with petty
crime you might think at Imperial
we are above such feelings and
actions. Not so. Most of the people
I told were sympathetic, but had
their own story of woe to tell;
'Yeah, that happened to me once,
terrible isn't it?'
Terrible it is, but not the material
loss, just the intrusion and suspicion
of fellow human beings. That's the
worst.

Tummy trouble
Dear Editor,
I must voice my concern over a
recent inclusion on the bottom of
page 19 (FELIX 946). 'Pounds,
shillings, pence', as any more
mature member of society will
know, is in fact L S D . As this
reference was present in the music
pages of Felix, I can only conclude
that Poddy the music editor was
responsible.
His involvement with such 'mind
bending' drugs would indeed ex-
plain his warped perception of reali-
ty and those psychadelic clothes he
inflicts on the general public.
Furthermore, I individually cut
500 of these inscriptions out of page
19 and on consuming these over the
weekendT did not find my 'inner-
self , but instead had a very poorly
turn and a very difficult time when
nature called.
I demand more editorial respon-
sibility in the future.
Yours Sincerely,
Dominic Wilkinson.
PS. Can I have my money back?
