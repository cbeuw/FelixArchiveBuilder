Give War a Chance
by P.J. O'Rourke
P.J. likes guns, and he likes
everyone to know that he likes
them. The bigger the better. So,
P.J. in the desert, in the Gulf, in the
middle of a war, is P.J.'s idea of
journalistic heaven.
O'Rourke also encounters 'evil'
of other kinds, like liberals,
"Hunting the Virtuous - and how
to clean and skin them'' ( Yep, he
can still turn out the odd phrase ),
and, strangely, "Sex with Dr. Ruth.
The point is O'Rourke rails against
people and ideas because he
sincerely believes them to be
wrong, and ultimately that America
and capitalism are the best country
and economic system in the world.
You may not believe in his politics
but his sense of style and humour
are enough to provoke thought in
the most hardened liberal.

Parliament of Whores
by P.J. O'Rourke
As post election fever begins to die
down in America, P.J. O'Rourke
has quietly slipped out the
paperback edition of '' Parliament
of Whores" - a heroic attempt to
comprehend the American
government and the bureaucracy
that has come to define it. O'Rourke
is a man who dresses to the right,
and it's from this right-wing
standpoint that he generates his
humour.
The book covers the 1988
American election and the
following two years, during which
time every aspect of the government
is examined: the Supreme Court
("Doing the Most Important Kind
of Nothing"), the Presidential
Election ("Attack of the Midget
Vote Suckers"), and "Among the
Compassion Fascists" on the
National March for Housing Now!
campaign - and these are just the
chapter titles. Buy this book.
Definitely!

The Virago of Wicked Verse
Edited by Jill Dawson
Much as I cringe at 'women's
publications', I really am enjoying
this anthology. I say 'am' because
I never finish reading poetry books.
The poems included in the
collection cover a wide range of
themes: Male and Female genitalia,
motherhood, loverhood, not
looking like Kim Basinger, etc.
There's bawdiness, brashness,
bolshiness, and a degree of
wickedness in many of these
poems. The saving grace is the
humour. It's a laugh out loud on the
tube (or in a lecture) kind of
humour. However, aside from this,
there are a few poems which jump
up and slap your face, and some
which gently touch your cheek.
A well balanced collection, with
very little 'woe are we women', but
plenty of talent, strength and
chilling wit.

I Hate the French Official
Handbook by Denise Tatcher
& Malcolm Scott
The T hate the French' Official
Handbook by Denise Tatcher &
Malcolm Scott.
'The French have always felt
jealous of and inferior to the
English. They are quite right to do
so.' So starts this invaluable guide.
All niggling little details that
annoyed you so much in the
froggies are compiled under
comprehensive headings (50
reasons to hate the french, French
rock'n'roll, Famous French etc.).
Most of these are remarkably
insightful and enlightening
(although somewhat unfounded at
time). Why is it that the suppository
is still one of the most prescribed
drugs by 'Ze French docteurs'?
Why the Marquis de Sade was in
fact a lightweight? The inventors of
the bidet and the tampon, who were
The Virago Book of Victorian
Ghost Stories
Edited by Richard Palby
Well, that's a good start; the cover
features 'Proserpine' by Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, and any one either
aware of the legend or the artwork,
will know that the piece features
said lady's consumption of a
poisoned pomegranate and her
placid wait for death. Suitably
melodramatic.
It is also universally
acknowledged that, M . R . James
and Henry James aside, women are
the best writers of ghosts and
supernaturally orientated stories,
whether it be Elizabeth Gaskell,
Rosa Mulholland, George Eliot or
Mary Shelley. Their stories evoke
such eerie beauty, such potent
unbridled emotion, and profoundly
giddy and soundless horror. This
collection of short stories, with its
magnificent sense of the macabre,
makes extremely enjoyable reading,
an entertaining night for all lovers
of the virago. Hell hath no fury.

they? All is revealed! The book
even goes one step further and
explains why other nations hate the
french (as if they needed reasons!).
A truly enjoyable read, although
to fully enjoy it a good knowledge
of the French and their culture is
required; at £4.99 it is best to poses
it or the book will seem rather
bland.
By the way, the 50th reason to
hate the french is that they are
cannibals - they eat frogs.
