This year the National UKSEDS
(Students for the Exploration and
Development of Space) Conference
is taking place on the weekend of
the 14/15th of November at the
Univeristy of Kent, in Canterbury.
The event is going to be held in the
Grimmond Building, one of the
newest buildings on the campus.
The facilities available are three
lecture theatres, seating 100, 150
and 200 people. There are several
seminar rooms, and also easy
access and facilities for the
disabled.
The plan is to have two lecture
tracks of four or five lectures a day
covering all aspects of the space
field, just a few examples are
'Space is good for you' by
Professor Heinz Wolff, 'The big
bang' by Dr Lewis Ryder,
'Terraforming' by M r Martyn
Fogg, 'Solar sails' by M r Colin
Jack, 'A day in the life of an
astronaut' by M r David Shayler and
'Space law' by Professor Francis
Lyall. In the other lecture theatre
there will be continuous
presentations in Starlab, and
inflatable planetarium. In the
Parachuting
seminar rooms and the main foyer
there will be stands and displays
from universities and space
industries from all over the country
to look at throughout the day, and
during the half an hour breaks
between all lectures. The weekend
is aimed at students of all ages who
are interested in Space and maybe
plan to have a career in this field.
The weekend will be a great
opportunity to meet other students
with the same interests and experts
already established in the Space
field. As well as being a lot of fun,
the weekend should prove very
informative and educational.
Late Saturday afternoon, society
issues will be discussed and the new
national Committee will be elected
at the Annual General Meeting. To
revive everyone after the A G M
there will be a reception and dance,
partly subsidised by the Unit for
Space Sciences (based at the
University of Kent), int he evening.

'So you do parachuting do you.
What's it like?' is a question most
parachutists are asked at some time
or another by friends, family or
members of the opposite sex they're
trying to impress. It's always a
tough one to answer. Will I get a
strange look if I describe the
absolute panic that grips me every
time I get ready to exit the aircraft.
Doing something because it scares
you is not normal behaviour. O K ,
so maybe I'm not normal.
IC Parachute and Skydiving Club
will give you the chance to try
parachuting on a weekend course
which ends with your first static line
parachute descent. To fill you in,
here's a couple of stories...
I suppose my instructor though it
was a joke when I asked 'What
happens if both parachutes fail?'
and he answered 'You go in.', 'Go
in where?' 'Just in.' Whatever it
was, 'going in' didn't sound good,
so I resolved not to do it.
Fortunately I didn't, and here I am
to tell the tale...
Since that first jump, I have
progressed (slowly) on to free fall,
a totally different rush to those first
few 'static line' jumps, when your
parachute opens for you. As they
say about most enjoyable activities,
such as sex, drugs and booze, the
first time is always the best. So
here's what it was like for me...
I put my rig on and sat quiet and
alone on the bench, slowly going
over my reserve drills. We were
slowly led out to get into the plane.
My first time in a light aircraft, and
I wasn't going to land with it!
Climbing to jump height was OK,
the familiar ear popping sensation
but there was no hostess handing
out the boiled sweets. The Jump
Master opened the door and the
noise and cold were a real surprise.
I was first out. I slid across and
poked my toes over the edge of the
door. I got into the correct position
and the Jump Master said 'Go', and
I went. There followed five seconds
of sensory overload and suddenly
like magic, this large hankie over
my head and a sort of quiet and
calm, in total contrast to the noise
of the exit. There is time in the air
to enjoy the view before preparing
to land. Landing itself involves the
unexpected ground rush then a
feeling not unlike being hit by a
London Bus on a good day for
traffic.
The only answer anyone gets now
to the 'What's it like?' questions is
'Try it!'. The club hopes to have its
first course together pretty soon.
The cost is around £85 for the
weekend training and your first
jump plus a few extras for club
membership and transport. If you
can raise £170 in sponsorship, the
Yachting-An Intro
1) hire a yacht or two. 2) organise
the crews. 3) organise the transport.
4) always carry a phonecard or an
old lOp piece, in order to phone a
snoozing captain. 5) check the tyre
pressures in case of four conflicting
valves. 6) buy lots of food; anything
with chocolate goes down
extremely well. (Incidentally,
nothing came back up, although
some people did appear to be
doubting the law of gravity).
To the sailing; Lymington to
Cowes, Cowes to Lymington. It's
very straightforward. The captains
are very experienced, very patient
and have a sense of humour to jolly
along some of the crew who may
lack insight into what is happening
(myself for example). Experienced
crew help the captains maintain
sanity.
In bright sunlight, not too much
wind and calm waters we sailed to
Cowes. Pop up the main sail and
spinnaker, then Bob's your uncle.
Slacken/tighten a rope continuously
and you're sailing. The crick in
your neck from looking up at the
spinnaker and the feeling that any
minute you're about to fall
ICSF
ICSF is darn pleased to present Tim
Burton's stunning slice of sfiear
fantasy. Edward Scissorhands.
Starring teen heart-throbb Johnny
Depp (Cry Baby), Alan Arkin (The
Rocketeer, Glengarry Glen Ross)
and Burton alumni Winona Ryder
(Beetlejuice and Mrs Harker in
Coppola's Dracula), this film is one
of the most unusual fantasies of
recent years.
Edward lives alone in a dark
mansion on the edge of a pastel
suburbia, after his inventor (Vincent
Price) dies just before giving him
hands. When the Avon Lady (Diane
Wiest) calls, Edward is taken into
the town, where he is at first
welcomed, but then reviled by the
townsfolk he befriends on account
of his unusual nature.'
Come and see if Edward gets the
girl, dices the baddies and saves the
world as we know it (well maybe
not that last bit) in Mech Eng 220
on Tuesday. Membership costs just
£3, which includes your first film
free and other films cost just £1
overboard are pure imagination.
After a night out in Cowes, a
cooked breakfast is mandatory.
This usually only applies to the
yacht which had the foresight to
stock up its galley. However,
seafarers, being kindhearted old
souls, beggars from the other yacht
may also be fed.
More sailing, this time in
overcast skies with some drizzle.
Real lift, true drama yacht races
were observed (or joined, as one
reliable source has claimed). Then
back to Lymington in one piece.
Sort of. One person decided to test
the temperature of the water with
the lower half of his body; another
decided at the last minute not to
allow the mainsail to propel him
overboard.
Future editions shall discuss
'fashion and sailing, are the two
synonymous?', 'Man overboard,
what to do'; 'Cooking, a sailors
guide' and 'ropes, a quick guide for
the colour blind'.
So, many thanks to my fellow
sailors for such a brilliant weekend.
I shall hopefully be allowed to join
them on future trips.
Filmsoc
This week's presentation by
FilmSoc is Father of the Bride,
starring Steve Martin (LA Story,
Roxanne). The film concerns the
trials and tribulations of an over-
protective father preparing for his
only daughter's wedding to Martin
Short (3 Amigos, 3 Fugitives). It is
a remake of the 1950s classic and
is full of the fast, witty humour that
we have come to expect from Steve
Martin. The prenuptial
pandemonium includes the first
chaotic meeting with the inlaws and
a variety of comic situations which
eventually sees Martin in jail. The
film, directed by Charles Shyer,
demonstrates brilliantly the comic
style and genius of Steve Martin,
continuing in the same mould as the
hugely successful Parenthood.
For an evening of side-splitting
humour, come along to Mech Eng
220 on Thursday 12th November at
7.30pm. Membership costs £6.50
with the first film free, and 90p
thereafter, and entry for non-
members is £1.90.
course is free. Subsequent jumps
are subsidised so are a bargain if
you want to become a Skygod! You
can also do a Tandem Skydive
which is a little more expensive but
involves a 40 second free fall
attached to a qualified instructor.
We jump at Peterborough
Parachute Centre, one of the best
and safest in the country (make sure
you tell your parents that).
For more details, come and see
us in the Brown Committee Room
12.30-1.00 on any Monday. And by
the way, don't ask the 'What's it
like?' question.
