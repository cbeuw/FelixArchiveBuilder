How to run a succesful Fringe show, Theatre West End, DramSoc's
better half give lessons.
Aim
The aim of this project was to
construct and run a theatre in the
West End of Edinburgh during the
Edinburgh Festival in August. This
involved some thirty members of
Imperial College Union's Dramatic
Society who were determined to
have some fun, and was achieved
with considerable success.
Theory
The Edinburgh Festival
incorporates festivals of Street
Theatre, Jazz, Film, a Military
Tattoo and the Festival Fringe,
which is a subtle blend of comedy,
cabaret and theatre. It takes place
during three weeks each August;
this year saw the tenth anniversary
of DramSoc's involvement.
Method
DramSoc hired a hall on the west
end of Princes Street, which is one
of the main shopping areas of
Edinburgh. In a mere five days it
was transformed into Theatre West
End, a Fringe venue, by a team of
students who perhaps hadn't been
able to find paid work during the
summer, or they'd maybe taken
August out in order to be at the
Festival. Let's face it, some of us
weren't even members of
DramSoc.
The theatre housed two of
DramSoc's own productions, which
this year were 'Teechers' by John
Godber and 'The Warden of the
Tomb' by Franz Kafka, and was
sublet to other theatre companies
for the rest of the time.
Results
The venue has a record of high
standards, with sublets returning
time and again. This year, the
Cambridge Mummers were
shortlisted for the Guardian's
International Student Drama Award
for their production of 'Magic Jack'
at Theatre West End. Dramsoc's
own performances were also well
received, with 'Teechers' drawing
large audiences and 'The Warden
of the Tomb' being reviewed in The
Stage]
Conclusion
The aim of the venture was to have
fun; being in Edinburgh during the
festival was superb. Once the
festival had begun, only a few hours
a day were spent working at the
venue, leaving the rest of the day
free. The accommodation was
spacious and subsidised, and as
Fringe performers, we joined the
Fringe Club (aka the Students'
Union Building of Edinburgh
University). This had three bars and
free bands and cabaret and
everything and it didn't stop serving
drinks until three o'clock in the
morning! I loved it so much, I tried
to transfer to Edinburgh University.
