The Fred ep—St Etienne,
Flowered Up,
The Rockingbirds
T'm too shaky for my Stevens/too
shaky for my Stevens/too shaky by
half
T'm too sexy for my cat/too sexy
for my cat/oh poo for pussy cat'
T'm too sexy for The Fred/too sexy
for The Fred/Mr Barrett said'
Sarah Cracknell's voice is like
pure honey, dripping from a piece
of freshly cooked toast. Pure
perfection.
Flowered Up produce a laddish,
raucous version of 'Don't Talk, Just
Kiss'. With the sort of energetic,
funky, fun beat that sent me
spinning round the room in a fit of
unashamedly excessive dancing.
Caron Wheeler—I Adore You
I wasn't too keen on reviewing this
single I must admit, another four
minutes of Soul II Soul style stop-
dance is not my idea of good music.
However the opening sounded
promising, atmospheric whooshes
suggesting that Ms Wheeler has
found a new musical direction. But
then came the drum beat and I knew
this was another track destined to
be played in many a yuppie wine
bar. Good points: I suppose the
bassline, though simple is nice and
deep but far too repetitive.
Felix 947
A bit close this one. The
Rockingbirds, 'Deeply Dippy'. A
rather splendid version of a splendid
song.
This is one of those record that
in years to come you'll be able to
show your kids and say T was
there'. If you don't buy it then who
the hell do you think you are. Right
Said Fred are right up there,
fighting with the likes of The
Monkees, The Lovin' Spoonful,
Abba for the crown. To be the
ultimate rulers of pop. The music
that will change the world.

The B side, the Club House Edit
will probably prove more popular
with its funkier, more dancefloor
orientated beat, but those damned
Soul II Soul string sounds are all too
evident, not a good move for a
singer still very much associated
with Jazzy B and Co. Fans of Soul
II Soul will not be disappointed, but
neither will they rush out to buy this
with their last bit of beer money.
And who on earth is it messing
around with a record player on the
end of the song anyway?

Mudhoney—Piece of Cake
The first time through I thought this
was a masterpiece. Unfortunately
after a couple of listens things
seemed to blend together into a
monotonous din. Is this their fault
or mine? 'Rock music is dead.' So
its the music's fault. Back in the late
sixty's things seemed so bright,
American garage was so fun. So it
didn't change the world, but the free
lovin' hippies couldn't either. Pop
music, even the disposable stuff
from TOTP, might not seem to
have any effect on the world. But
how can music change the world?
It can change people's personal
worlds. And as the saying goes,
'from little acorns...'
Its strange that in an album of
rocking pop toons the one track that
has set up home in my head is the
slow one. The one at the end.
'Acetone', 'The cliche song' more
like. 'Good morning Miss /1 think
I'm losing it'. But there's something
there, something that seems to be
missing in their other offerings.
The main problem seems to be
that nothings shines. In an album
there should always be some crap
stuff, so that the good stuff can be
seen. So, no masterpiece, but the
fact that I even thought about it
makes it better than ninety percent
of this week's offerings.

Bleach —Hard
Bleach for the most part of this year
have been lost at sea. One of the
many girl led guitar bands around
at the moment, it has always been
difficult to see where Bleach fit in.
Their ability to drift in and out of
different scenes has ultimately left
them not being accepted by any of
them.
The front cover of this album
depicts a monochrome image of a
woman's outstretched arm with an
apple resting firmly in the palm of
the hand. Perhaps this is some
dubious biblical reference to
forbidden fruit and temptation.
Whilst no apocalyptical vision of
self-destruction or no means to an
end, Bleach's 'Hard', a mini album
is more of a self-effacing gesture.
In many ways it is their 'Time's
Arrow', not so much a reinvention
but a redefinition of themselves as
a band. This is emphasized on 'Hit
on Her' where Salli sings; 'the past
rides with me...every mile is etched
on my body/Can't I be born
again?'. The guitars seem less harsh
than on previous efforts and more
atmospheric. Bleach are at their best
on 'Hit on Me' and 'Can', songs
which point to the importance of
women in rock, but are at their least
effective on 'Baby Toes' where
Salli invites us to join her in a sexual
nightmare. As a gesture though,
'Hard' is a bit limp wristed and only
half succeeds.
