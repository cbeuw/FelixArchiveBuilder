Free in the Air
Rafal Lukawiecki takes his first flight...
I always wanted to feel free! It must
sound like a cliche, but watching
birds have made me realise that
there are many things I and many
other people will never be able to
achieve, however hard you try.
While some of them are really
impossible, others turn out to be
exhilarating experiences if one has
a chance to try them out. Gliding
happened to be the latter one for
me.
While wandering among stalls at
this year's Freshers' Fair and
pretending to be one year younger,
I saw an elegant glider surrounded
by a bunch of enthusiastic looking
people (one of them was wearing a
parachute and kept on telling
everybody that he was a Pilot). My
instinct told me that it was a thing
I should consider trying. Two days
later I signed myself for a trial flight
with Imperial College Gliding Club.
As I live in Balham, I had to wake
up at 5am on Sunday 11 October to
be at 7am in Southside (yes, the
biggest capital in the world has a
most remarkable public transport
system). It was unearthly cold when
I met some other half-asleep people
led by Sarah, who seemed to keep
herself warm by talking about
virtually everything, occasionally
stopping to take a deep breath. After
about 40 minutes of unsuccessful
; " : ; ;
waiting for the other 'leaders' and
their cars, half of us (including
lucky me who picked the winning
match) left to Lasham, which is
about 1 hour away from London.
Although we had no chance to fly
on that day because the always
predictable sort of well-known
English weather made us stay
indoors, I knew I had swallowed the
hook together with the fisherman
and I was about to become a
compulsive gliding addict in no time
at all.
I turned up in Lasham on my own
on a sunny Tuesday afternoon and
joined the queue for the 'Air
Experience' trial flight.
Nevertheless, it was not till my
other flight on this day, that I
reached the climax of feeling
freedom in the air; which was one
of the most beautiful and mind-
blowing experiences in my life. I
was lucky to have been given a
training flight by Paul Minton,
retired former president of the IC
Gliding Club—-I learnt about that
only a few days later! His attitude
towards flying and teaching others
to fly was one of an over-
enthusiastic small boy who knows
that he is doing something he likes
an awful lot. That enthusiasm was
contagious. Having been launched
by wire winch, we climbed to the
altitude of nearly 2000 feet above i
the ground in a matter of about 15
seconds! That was quite dramatic
(but extremely exciting from the
point of view of a rollercoaster fan)
introduction to something very calm
and different: flying without any
artificial help of an engine. Paul
showed me the basic movements of
controls and their effects on the
aircraft (to which he always
referred to as 'she') and asked me
to try them out myself. While
smoothly and quietly gliding
through the air I begun to learn to
enjoy being free in all three
— mam
dimensions. From the very first
moment I touched the 'stick' and
saw the earth run away from my
eyes and then appear on another
side of the glider, I started to realise
that this was another milestone,
another normally inaccessible limit
. which I now had at my feet.
The flight did not last too long,
but it made me grin and feel happy
all through the evening (someone
even asked me what I was on).
Undoubtedly, gliding is a drug and
a very addictive one, too. It makes
you think about harmony in which
one has to be with the nature if they
want to survive. It is one of those
rare moments when almost
everything including your life is
only up to you and the nature. It is
a way to see the stunning beauty of
freedom in all dimensions apart
from time.
You probably know that
practically anybody can fly gliders,
especially now, while at College. It
would not cost you much, as all
flying is subsidised by the Union.
An experience that you may have
been unsuccessfully looking for on
every weekend's night, will not cost
you more than what you spend on
drinks, etc when you go out. And
it may turn out to be much more!
Gliding is also the first step in
obtaining an official Pilot's licence,
but this is another story.
Imperial College Gliding Club is
the largest gliding organisation of
such sort in Britain. You are
welcome to come to any of its
weekly meetings on Thursdays at
lpm in room 266 in the Aeronautics
building. Trial 'no-obligation'
flights are run during the first term.
