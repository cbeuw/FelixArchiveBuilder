Invasion Werewolf
Ever wondered why cult-movie fans
seem to like old (1950s) horror
movies so much? After all, they
were usually underbudgeted, shot
without a script, using special
effects primitive by today's
standards...What's so impressive
about a big piece of coloured
rubber-foam terrorising your local
neighbourhood? How can anyone
be interested in characters which are
so stereotyped you forget in which
movie your saw them (the mad
scientist, the cafe waitress, the
reporter, the federal agent)?
Well, if you want to find out,
Invasion Werewolf is just the play
to see. It's written and played by
Johnny Myers who is himself a 50s
horror fan, and it does a pretty good
job of explaining the appeal of these
movies. The idea is to take you into
the office of a 'Cheapo Production'
manager, and enter his imagination
as he reads the script for a
prospective horror picture. The
more he reads, the more the
audience is able to see the movie
forming in his mind.
The movie ('Invasion Werewolf)
is written and performed so well
that the audience starts seeing in
black and white, hearing glitches in
the soundtrack, and generally
forgetting they are in a theatre.
Johnny Myers is capable of
changing characters so convincingly
and quickly that the acting seems
almost simultaneous (his miming
capabilities are also quite
impressive...). The illusion of a
movie is further enhanced by a
clever use of lighting which helps
streamline the changing of scenes,
and the music and sound effects for
the play are also quite good.
You may not come out of this
play a cult-fan, but you will have
'seen' a good movie, and you will
probably come to appreciate the
underlying humour of this genre.

Gallery
Flight: Aeronautics Gallery,
Science Museum
The Flight Gallery chronicles man's
failures and successful attempts to
fly.
Entering the gallery, you are led
through a fascinating series of
exhibits that trace the Dream of
Flight. Da Vinci's early sketches
lead onto the work of the early
experimenter's Cayley, Henson and
Stringfellow, before the start of
powered and unpowered flight at
the start of the twentieth century.
The rest of the exhibits are divided
into four sections. The historical
narrative of the development of air
transport continues through the use
of archive footage and static
displays.
The development of the aero
engines is traced from the first
piston powered engines to the first
gas turbine engine designed by
Frank Whittle. The evolution of the
gas turbine continues through to the
large turbofans used on today's
airliners and the engine used in the
Harrier jump jet.
The remaining area of the gallery
is used to display the Science
Museum's extensive collection of
aircraft and memorabilia. Hanging
from the roof are a Spitfire,
Hurricane, the first aircraft to cross
the Atlantic - a Victor Vimy, the
prototype Harrier Jump Jet, the
cross-section from a 747 Jumbo Jet
and many others. Housed in show
cases are a range of flying suits,
wind tunnel models and flight
instruments and other exhibits.
To make the past more colourful
and vivid, characters from the
history of flight are played by actors
who roam the gallery, bringing the
past to life.
In order to make aeronautics easier
to understand, there is a flight lab
outside the gallery. Although
nominally for the children, it
demonstrates all the principles of
flight through easy to understand
models and simple experiments.

Wozzeck
Opera
Wozzeck
As theatre, ENO's Wozzeck is an
engrossing and moving experience,
and those who think they may not
respond to Berg's overwhelmingly
powerful, although inititally
difficult, music, need not be
deterred.
David Pountney's production
brilliantly combines the grim and
the lurid; corrugated metal shutters
rise and fall on ther bleak barrack-
room world in which Wozzeck's
three garish, grotesque tormentors,
the nagging Captain, the sinister
Doctor and the brutal Drum-Major,
berate and bully him. Wozzeck
himself needs to be much more than
an anonymous victim; in a society
which regards him as little more
than a robot, it is his imagination
and sensitivity which destroy him.
Donald Maxwell's is an ideal
performance, bringing not only
these characteristics but also
accurate, rich-toned singing to the
central role. He is complemented by
Kristine Ciesinski, whose bright,
strong voice is well-suited to the
part of Marie, his unfaithful lover.
The triumphant concert
performance of Schoenberg's
Moses and Aaron which opened this
year's Edinburgh Festival firmly
established conductor Richard
Armstrong's credentials as an
interpreter of the Second Viennese
School, and he devotes similar care
and insight to Berg's complex and
richly rewarding score. His is a
clear-headed reading, all the more
involving for its avoidance of
hysteria in such climactic passages
as the D minor interlude in the third
act.
