W h o Remembers the Armenians N o w ?
Christopher Riley visits war torn Eastern Turkey and discovers a
third player in the Kurdish problem.
Across town, near the hospital,
Hakkan is extending his carpet shop
and enlarging the basement. But
two days ago, work stopped when
they came across human bones, a
lot of them. The young Kurds
stopped the excavations
immediately to call in someone
from Van museum. A curator
arrived the same day and picked a
large skull from the dust and turned
it in his hands. 'It's O K , they are
Armenians,' he concluded. 'Dig.'
We now all sit
round the
television set. I
politely guzzle
tea, whilst the
family fight over
the remote
control.
It is another parched day on the
shores of the dead salt lake near
Van in Eastern Turkey. My thirst
has not been quenched by the Ayran
yoghurt drink, and the spicy Eristeli
soup hasn't helped either. We now
all sit round the television set. I
politely guzzle tea, whilst the family
fight over the remote control. The
Acar family are half Kurdish and
half Turkish; their grandmother was
Armenian. I ask them how they felt
about the Turkish massacre of
Kurdish refugees from Iraq during
the Gulf War. 'This is propaganda,'
they say. 'Turkey accepted 3,000
refugees from Iraq, we are friends
with the Kurds.' I say I have seen
pictures and read reports of the
massacre. They look at me with
distain.
In a bid to start some more
conversation, I ask what the books
above the T V are. They are Turkish
encyclopaedias, and I ask 17 year
old El if to translate some of the
entries. Out of curiosity I choose the.
'A - Bu' volume and open the book
to Armenia. We go through the text
and discover that 'Armenians once
lived in Turkey and some still do.
In Turkey they are free but in their
own country they are not.'
The old city of Van, formerly the
citadel of the Urartian Empire and
unquestionably Armenian in the 6th
century, today lies as a ruin outside
the new city, levelled in 1915
before the Russians invaded. At this
time there were still 20 million
Armenians in Eastern Turkey who
had fought along side the Ottoman
Turks against Russian invasion.
Under Russian occupation the
'Young Turks' quickly grew
suspicious of the Armenians and
executed all the armed soldiers.
Civilians were deported to the
Syrian deserts and put to death.
Today there are barely 40,000
Armenians left in Eastern Turkey.
I excuse myself when the teapot
runs out for the second time and
leave to return to my hotel for an
appointment with Cihat at eight. We
go to a smoky crowded bar across
town and sit at the back so that we
can see the whole room and the
door. We talk of friends I met on
my last visit to Van three years
before. Moussin is now working in
Hakkari as a government lawyer
and Houdain has joined the PKK,
the banded Kurdish Working Party
who operate a guerilla warfare
against the Turks in Eastern
Turkey.
/ say I have
seen the pictures
and read the
reports of the
massacre. They
look at me with
disdain.
The P K K have enjoyed a
renewed support in the area this
year since an unofficial state of
emergency was imposed on 21
March, following a new clamp
down on Kurds by the Turkish
authorities. Cihat describes the
scene in Van that day when two
young boys were shot dead by
police during a peaceful march in
support of the Kurds. 'I tried to
phone London to tell the world, but
all the phone lines to Van had been
stopped,' he complains. 'I think
over 90 people were killed in other
towns that day. Since this time the
BBC news is always wrong. No-one
knows what is happening here.'
Cihat says he knows the leader of
the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, and has
spoken to him recently. I ask what
exactly the PKK are fighting for.
'For the Kurdish people,' he
replies. This was originally our land
- there are artefacts to prove it. We
just want to agree with the
government to get a federation.'
'Of course the Armenians also
have a claim to this land,' I begin.
'The new Armenian money depicts
a view of Mount Ararat from
Turkey.' Cihat smiles for the first
time. And isn't Abdullah Ocalan,
the P K K leader, an Armenian!' I
continue, remembering a rumour I
had heard before. His eyes focus on
me.
'Yes, Ocalan is originally
Armenian.' He replies slowly and
indignantly.
'How would you divide Eastern
Turkey?T continue.
'The people of north Ararat,
around Kars and in the Kackar
mountains are more Armenian.
Those in the south around Van are
now Kurds. We would put the
border north of Van.'
Furthest west in Tatvan, Mustaffa,
a Kurdish construction worker is
interested to learn that Ocalan is
Armenian. I ask the same questions
about the borders. Armenia extends
below Van and his Kurdistan lies
around Diyarbakir to the west.
The next day I return to my hotel
in the early hours of the morning.
