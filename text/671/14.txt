Yet another egg-celent chess puzzle from Anatoly
Two egg-spert chess players were playing in the Primelia College
Chess Club last week, and to add some egg-citement, Egbert (White)
was trying not to win, but to have his king checkmated, but Shelley
(Black) tried to avoid checkmating him. The match had reached the
position above; (White to play and lose and advancing up the page).
How did Egbert manage to lose in three moves?
Only legitimate moves are allowed.
(Ulysses and Anatoly would like it to be known that they had nothing
to do with the puns in this puzzle).
