Refectories
Last Thursday a 3% increase in the price of refectory meals was
announced. This is to be on top of a 2'/»% rise implemented at the
start of the season. The increase is based on the rise in price of an
average person's groceries and cannot be directly compared to the
requirements of a refectory system which purchases in bulk.
Until recently the refectories used to lose vast amounts of money
each year, now due to increased efficiency it now makes a modest
profit. These savings have not been taken into account when
calculating the price increase.
The 3% price increase seems to have been conjured out of thin air
and has no logical basis. It would have been sensible to base any price
rise on the current performance of the refectory system. This
unfortunately is not possible because it takes several months to get
any useful information out of the refectory accounts. The problem is
that the refectory pricing policy is based on guesswork and archaic
accounting procedures.
- The Union has been pressing College for years for a proper
breakdown of the performance of individual refectories to little avail.
Instead of brushing aside comments from the Union when College
are losing the argument they should perhaps take the Union a little
more seriously. If we have control of the Union Refectory next year
maybe we can show College how a refectory should be run.
