Eric's not
a Sloth!
Dear Pallab, I
Having read your editorial
in the sabbatical elections
results flysheet we take ex-
ception to your comments
about Eric Darbyshire. As
R S C U President he has coped
with the resignation of our
Hon Sec (Sue Humphrey) at
the beginning of the Christmas
Term, both persuading her to
carry on with the organisation
of Fresher's D i n n e r s and
getting the rest of her duties
done while a new Hon Sec was
elected.
He has run the R S C U elec-
tions this year properly and
fairly with the highest number
of votes in living memory. This
is indicative that people both
know and care about R S C U
and should be ascribed not
only to the candidates but also
to his leadership over the past
year. Eric has also recovered
£600 from I C U to support two
societies which were to be
killed off, but have made a
strong comeback.
A l l in all, we do not believe,
as do you, that he will be a
sloth in the office, merely
adhering to his job description
and doing bugger all else.
We think he will make a good
Hon Sec with his other int-
erests such as Rag and finance
occupying him usefully. If you
remember, M a r t i n T a y l o r
expresed similar sentiments
this time last year and he has
been proved wrong; we believe
you will also be proved wrong.
Yours faithfully

Apathy
pear Pallab,
The ' N e w D e a l ' Grants
march on Saturday 12th March
was a resounding success - an
estimated 30 000 people turned
up. From colleges all ovei the
country, students arrived by
the coach-load to demonstrate
against the planned cuts to
further education spending by
the government. Some students
even arrived from Ireland to
take part. The only blot on the
proceedings was that fewer
than 30 IC students managed

to drag themselves all the way
from South Kensington to take
a stand. More to the point,
where were our elected rep-
resentatives? Not suprisingly,
not one sabbatical turned up;
nor did any of the recently
elected people (so much for
their promises to 'fight' for this
and that...) with the exception,
I am told, of Ann Collins of
RCS. The only union official
present was Peter Burt, our
External Affairs Officer who,
thankfully, is really committed
to his job.
So maybe this event was
organised by the N U S , to
whom we refuse to reaffiliate.
The issue, however, affects us
all. How would you manage
without a real grant? It's about
time students and their supp-
osed representatives at IC
realised that apathy is not
enough. Our rift with the N U S
is particularly hypocritical seen
in this light - we sjarvive in their
wake; if it was left to IC.
students to fight for their own
l i v i n g and w o r k i n g c o n d -
itions, this college would fade
away altogether.
Higher education in this
country is in real danger. Here
was a chance for us to say
something about it; here was a
chance for those who are paid
to represent us - yet are so
remote from us - to show they
are actually concerned; and
what happens? Nothing. Such
overwhelming apathy is both
sickening and saddening.

Cut the
Fascist Jibes
Dear Pallab
I was disgusted to see that the
fairly sensible and objective
news item in F E L I X two weeks'
ago about U G C cuts was given
such an irresponsible and
extremely offensive heading. By
printing that item under the
heading 'More Fascist Tory
Cuts' you insult the democratic
system of British Government,
I Wednesday,
you deny the rights of people to
have a different view from
yours without being given an
unpleasant label, and you
decrease the likelihood of
F E L I X being taken seriously by
anyone.
Giving you the benefit of the
doubt, you are merely guilty of
unethical journalism because of
your gross inaccuracy. The
Shorter O^iord Dictionary
defines a Fascist as 'one of a
body of Italian nationalists
organised in 1919 under Benito
•"Mussolini to oppose Bol-
shevism'. Anyone with the
slightest knowledge of politics
will know that (as well as there
being a distinct lack of Italian
nationalists in the Conservative
party), there is no similarity
b e t w e e n m o d e r n T o r y
philosophy (based on freedom
of the individual) and Fascism
(based on state regulation of the
economy and people's lives).
If one were to be slightly less
kind, one might extrapolate
from the usual frivolous style of
F E L I X , and assume that
'Fascist' was meant to be taken
in the colloquial sense, ie Nazi.
In that case you would be
comparing (in a subtle and
insiduous way) the cutting of a
particular aspect of public
expenditure with genocide,
mass torture and the complete
extermination of all possible
opposition. Such an implica-
tion would be i m m o r a l
journalism, and would cast
grave doubts on your editorial
competence and scrupuless-
ness..
To add insult to injury, you
included a caricature of me in
last week's 'Sucker' cartoon
about education cuts. I am not
ashamed of taking a broader
view of the situation than
people like you and Peter Burt
do. There are many interest
groups, all crying for a larger
handout from the 'bottomless
pit of government financial
resources,' and students are
only one of them. Students at
IC are the same people who in a
few years time will be
complaining that personal
taxation is too high. I consider
your actions in printing that
cartoon a form of intimidation,
March 21, 19849LWSBLVmMIM
ie 'If you dare to dissent from
the left-wing views of F E L I X
hacks and Union hacks, we
shall use the Union publication
to portray you in a ridiculous
manner'. I hope that this
editorial thuggery will cease,
and F E L I X will at least attempt
to take an objective stance on
political issues.
Yours sincerely

Mines
Porn Night
Dear Pallab,
Last Friday, another porn-
ographic event was organised
by the Royal School of Mines
Union. We do not question the
legality of such an event, as the
results of several U G M s show
sympathy to such happenings,
but now set out some of our
objections to pornography,
which stem from our comm-
itment to God as Christians,
leaving aside many of the
moral, humanistic arguments
w h i c h have already been
presented.
There are many forms of
idolatry, and pornographic
obsession is one, because a gift
of G o d - our human sexuality -
which is intended to be a joyful
self-giving act w i t h i n the
sanctity of marriage, is rem-
oved from that environment
and placed above its proper
position.
In attempting to fill one's
sexual desires, whether in
fornication or being stimulated
by any pornographic medium,
the motive is rooted selfish
ambition or greed, which is in
exact opposition to the attitude
God wishes us to have in all
things, not least in our per-
sonal sexuality. Our sexuality
is given to us for affirmation,
sustainance and healing, one
partner to another; porn-
ography removes the life and
real humanity from this, amnd
instead leads into a cul-de-sac
of fetled fantasies. St Paul
writes "there are no forbidden
things; maybe, but not every-
thing does good."
Pornography is also a des-
troyer of our sexual growth:
while one's physical maturity
may be fully developed, en-
gagement in p o r n o g r a p h y
leaves one's mind in an ex-
tended adolescence, which
limits sexual fulfilment to
genital stimulation and mast-
urbatory experiences. This
transformation of God's sexual
