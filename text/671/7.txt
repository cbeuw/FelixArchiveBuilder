BENEFITS OVER EASTER
1. Unemployment Benefit
To qualify for this you must have
paid National Insurance contri-
butions on earnings of at least-
11,350 between April 1981 and
March 1982 or on earnings of at
'least £1,435 between April 1982
and March 1983 (ie any money
you earned last summer doesn't
count).
PLUS
2. Certified Housing Benefit and
Housing Benefit Supplement
If you don't mind 'signing on' in
London, this is the quickest way
to get the highest proportion of
your rent back.
OR
3. Standard Housing Benefit
The slower but simpler way of
claiming rent back particularly
useful if you are already claiming
Housing Benefit or you don't
want to have to 'sign on' in
London during the vacation.
1. Unemployment Benefit
The calculations behind this
benefit are long and complicated
but a rough guide is given below.
NB: These conditions of eligi-
bility change in January each
year so some of you who were not
eligible in the Christmas vacation
may be eligible now. /
If you think you may be
eligible for unemployment bene-
fit it is well worth applying since
it does provide a weekly rate of
£27.05 throughout the vacation.
It can also be claimed irrespective
of whether you are staying in
London or going elsewhere for
the vacation since unemployment
benefit can be claimed from any
Unemployment Benefit Office in
whose area you happen to be
staying when you become eli-
gible. If you are claiming
unemployment benefit you may
also be entitled to Housing
Benefit Supplement and/or
Standard Housing Benefit (see
below).
2. Certified Housing Benefit and
Housing Benefit Supplement
These oenefits are best con-
sidered together since they are
inter-related and the methods for
initiating a claim for both bene-
fits are the same. Both benefits
are only available to those able to
'sign on' as unemployed and
available for work in the area in
which they are paying rent.
Claims for Certified Housing
Benefit and Housing Benefit
Supplement are initiated through

Every Easter Vacation hundreds of students lose an awful lot of
money simply because they are not aware of the benefits they are
entitled to. The three main benefits students are entitled to are
unemployment benefit, certified housing benefit and standard
housing benefit. Check each of the sections and decide which
benefit applys to you.

the DHSS (see 'To Claim' below)
and are dependent on that
department making an assess-
ment of the claimant's eligibility
for Supplementary Benefit. Cer-
tified Housing Benefit is avail-
able only to those receiving
Supplementary Benefit whilst
Housing Benefit Supplement is
available to those who narrowly
miss qualifying for Supple-
mentary Benefit.
The vacation element in the
undergraduate grant (currently
£24.55) is designed to be roughly
equivalent to the single persons
'non-householder' rate of
Supplementary Benefit thereby
preventing the majority of stu-
dents from being eligible for
Supplementary Benefit in the
short vacations. However, some
Wednesday, March 21, 1984 ^BmWkWkWBM
students such as those living in
single independent bedsits or
flats may be classified as 'house-
holders' by the D H S S and
therefore be entitled to a small
weekly sum from the D H S S
despite the vacation element in
the grant. There is also a
classification known as 'joint
householder' which applies to
those who share their household
; expenses with others eg, a group
sharing a flat. In practical terms,
for the short vacations, those
who share their 'household' with
no more than one otheF person
may be entitled to a small weekly
sum from the DHSS.
To claim: G o down to your
local Unemployment Benefit
Office on the first weekday of the
vacation and 'sign on' as unem-
ployed and available for work. If
you are not eligible for
Unemployment Benefit (see
above) then your papers will
automatically be passed on to the
local Supplementary Benefit
Office (DHSS). The Unemploy-
ment Benefit Office will tell you if
and when they want you to 'sign
on' again and will give you a form
B l to send to your local DHSS.
The DHSS may call you for an
interview and they will need to
see proof of identity and proof of
your financial situation ie recent
bank statements, building society
accounts etc. The DHSS will
assess your claim to see if you are
entitled to any Supplementary
Benefit and they will inform you
in writing of their decision.
Always make it clear to the
DHSS that you want to claim
your housing costs back.
If you are entitled to Supple-
mentary Benefit this should be
paid by fortnightly giro cheques.
Entitlement to Supplementary
Benefit carries with it entitlement
to Certified Housing Benefit.
This means that the D H S S will
send 'certificate' on your behalf
to the Local Housing Authority
authorising them to pay your
housing costs. The Housing1
Authority will then send you
more forms which need to be
completed and returned to the
relevant Town Hall together with
proof of your rent and rates.
Although this is a long and
tedious process, Certified Hous-
ing Benefit claims are considered
urgent payments and are there-
fore prioritised over Standard
Housing Benefit claims. Certified
claims should be (although in
