Work has started on a new
electronic surveillance and
security system for the Southside
Halls of Residence. The present
system is felt to be inadequate
since unauthorised people are
still able to get in the Halls late at
night when they are allowed
access by residents entering the
building.
Chief Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves said that the new system
will have the current outer lock to
the building with a magnetic key
card lock for the inner doors. A
T V surveillance system will also
be introduced to enable guards in
Southside and Sherfield to moni-
tor or the area between the two
doors and the area around the
lift.
A n internal phone will be
placed at the main entrance to
enable visitors to call residents to
allow them access.

U G M chairman and former IC
President John Passmore failed
in his bid to become University of
London President last Saturday.
M r Passmore was beaten by
Bedford College President, Del
Morgan.
F o r several years, M r
Passmore has been one of the
most active members of U L U
General Union Council. Two
years ago, he would have been
favourite to become 'President
had he stood for election.
However since then M r Passmore
has become disillusioned with the
union. He has also lost the
support of the left wing grouping
at U L U . To quote M r Passmore
'They've discovered I'm a fascist
really'.
M r Passmore's campaign for
president lacked conviction. His
manifesto was not circulated in
advance of the meeting and he
did not attend the election
meeting of G U C .
The only other IC candidate to
stand in the U L U elections is Jo
Claydon who is running for
S e n a t o r for Science a n d
Engineering. The result of this
election will be announced today.

D o Y o u C a r e ?
30,000 young people from all over Britain took part in the recent
'New Deal for Youth' march, however the contingent from Imperial
College numbered only 30.
The march was organised by the National Union of Students and the
London student organisation to protest about recent government cuts in
the education budget. Ken Livingstone, leader of the GLC, and Neil
Stewart, NUS President, both spoke at the rally that followed the march.
