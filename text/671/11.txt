THE FUTURE OF LONDON'S EDUCATION
Threats to ILEA
Government plans will be of
direct relevance to many of
London's students through their
effect on the Inner London
Education Authority (ILEA).
I L E A is responsible for public
educated in the twelve inner
London boroughs and the City of
London. It is constitutionally a
special committee of the G L C ,
but is financially, politically, and
administratively independent of
the G L C . Changes to I L E A
planned by the Government
would quite simply wreck
London's education service and
have been opposed by all parties
on ILEA.
I L E A is threatened by two
White Papers currently before
Parliament.
Rates
T h e ' R a t e s ' b i l l u n d e r
consideration will, if passed,
allow Central Government to
single out a handful of 'over-
spending' local authorities and
determine the maximum rate
they can legally raise. Informed
sources do not doubt that I L E A
would appear on the Govern-
ments 'hit list'. The consequence
of this would be a reduction of
£ 120m—almost 13%—in I L E A
spending, resulting in a catalogue
of disasters; redundancies, cuts in
equipment spending in schools,
closure of courses and colleges,
bigger classes and, of course, a
general drop in standards.
draconian
powers
Few IC students would suffer
as a result of this. However,
I L E A administers five poly-
technics and 29 other colleges.
These could face, for instance, a
doubling of hostel and catering
charges and early closure in
winter to save fuel. Cuts in I L E A
discretionary awards could mean
no grant for 1,500 students.
The 'Rates' Bill has received
particularly harsh criticism.
Edward Heath, a former Prime
M i n i s t e r , described it as
conferring 'draconian powers'.
M r Heath has said that central
government has not needed these
powers previously—even during
two world wars.
However, the scheme is set to be
implemented this summer.
The Government intends to abolish the Greater London
Council (GLC) and the six Metropolitan Country Councils
(MCCs). They also plan to introduce 'rate capping' legisla-
tion this summer. These plans are a serious threat to the
autonomy of Local Authorities and to democracy itself.
What will they mean for London's education?
'Streamlining the Cities'
The 'Streamlining the Cities'
White Paper which deals with the
abolition of the G L C and M C C s
plans to retain a unified
education service in Inner
London. However, a new
authority would be set up to
adminster this service, thus
replacing I L E A . This would be a
joint board, consisting of about
fifty councillors nominated by
the Inner London boroughs and
the City of London. Londoners
would therefore no longer
directly elect an education
a u t h o r i t y , a n d b o r o u g h
councillors would take on an
additional heavy workload to
which they were not particularly
suited.
A l l political parties on I L E A
have expressed their reservations
to the plans. The White Paper
gives only a mere outline of pro-
posed changes and has clearly
been rushed and poorly pre-
pared.
Unfortunately this reorganisa-
tion and the transitional
arrangements will lead to a costly
bureaucratic turmoil which will
in no way help tackle Inner
London's pressing problems
with education.
Why is this legislation
needed?
Two principal reasons are given
for these reforms. The G L C and
M C C s are seen as an unnecessary
tier of government, but this
clearly cannot apply to I L E A
since, as we have seen, an overall
joint board for the whole of Inner
urban
deprivation
London is to be set up. The major
reason is the Government's
desire to limit local authority
spending, despite the fact that
over the last five years ILEA'S
budgeted gross expenditure
overall has dropped by about
3'/2% in real terms.
There are good reasons why
services should not be cut to
p r o v i d e g r e a t e r s a v i n g s .
Education in Inner London costsi
more than elsewhere due to the
high prices found in London and
the particular social conditions
existing. These include a
changing population, over-
crowding, and a high proportion
of single pa.wiit families, which
all contribute to a high level of
urban deprivation. Schools in
London are particularly old and
t h e r e f o r e r e q u i r e m o r e
maintenance.
dangerous
centralisation
Furthermore, claims that
abolition of the G*LC and M C C ' s
would lead to a significant annual
saving have been dismissed by
Coopers and Lybrand, a highly
respected private firm o f
management consultants.
Why this legislation is
NOT needed
The two sets of proposals raise
fundamental issues of principle.'
They limit the right of the local
community, through its elected
authority, to determine rates and
levels of services. They remove
direct accountability from the
electorate and bring about
dangerous centralisation. They
are also unpopular, and should
so serve as a warning to those
opportunists who wish to tamper
with the nature of our democratic
system
'Conservative ministers who
during the Government's first term
of office were preaching enhanced
accountability and stronger links
in local government between the
payers and providers are now
proposing to create a string of
bodies whose decisions, financial
and political, cannot be
adjudicated through the ballot
box. Instead, they will be subject to
yet more control and interference
from the centre.'
