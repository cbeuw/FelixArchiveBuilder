Welfare
practice rarely are) resolved
within 14 days of the claim being
received by the Housing Author-
ity and can provide you with
100% rebate of your rent and
rates over the vacation (but not
any charges included in your rent
for gas or electricity).
If you are not entitled to
Supplementary Benefit instead of
authorising the Housing Author-
ity to pay your Housing costs, the
DHSS will simply send you a
Standard Housing Benefit form
for you to complete and send to
the Housing Authority con-
cerned. This form will however
be stamped by the D H S S and
have an 'excess income' figure
marked on it. This figure
determines how much Housing
Benefit Supplement you will
receive above your normal
Standard H o u s i n g Benefit
entitlement. Your claim will be
dealt with as a Standard Housing
Benefit claim (see below), but you
should be given priority over
other Standard Housing Benefit
claims and your total rebate will
be higher than if you had gone
direct to the Housing Authority.
3. Standard Housing Benefits
Many of you will hopefully
already have submitted claims
for rent and rate rebates during
term time although many of you
are probably still awaiting the
result of your claim. During the
short vacations your official
weekly income from your grant
falls to £24.55, you are also not
subject to the term time student
deductions from your rent and
thus the rent and rate rebate
calculation should leave you with
a large rebate on your rent and
rates over the vacation, (less any
amounts for gas and electricity).
Moreover, this benefit doesn't
involve any 'signing on' and can
be paid even if you are not staying
in your term time residence.
To Claim (if you have already
submitted a claim): Many of the
local H o u s i n g A u t h o r i t i e s
a r o u n d the C o l l e g e w i l l
automatically reassess students'
Housing Benefit claims for the
short vacations if term dates were
submitted with the original
claim. However, the Housing
Benefit regulations do place a
clear responsibility on the
claimant to inform the Housing
Authority of any changes in
circumstances, and there are
some authorities (notably
Kensington and Chelsea) who
will refuse to reassess your claim
unless you specifically request a
reassessment for the vacation.
Therefore I would suggest that,
whichever your authority, you
write to them now, informing
them of your vacation dates,
reminding them that your
vacation income from your grant
is only £24.55 per week,
informing them that you will not
be working over the vacation (if
that is the case) and asking them
to reassess your claim for those
weeks.
To Claim (for those who haven't
yet submitted claims): D O SO"
NOW! Forms for Westminster,
Kensington & Chelsea, Hammer-
smith & Fulham, Ealing and
Hounslow are available from
Student Services, for other
boroughs visit your local Town
Hall. When you submit your
form you will need to include
proof of your grant from your
Local Education Authority,
proof of your rent, ie rent
book/rent receipts/letter from
your landlord (Student Services if
you are in College accommoda-
tion) and a note of your term-
dates. Remember these claims
cannot be backdated—if you
have not applied by the beginning
of the vacation you will lose your
money. However, if you do apply
now enclosing the term dates and
making it clear you wish to apply
for term time and vacation then
you should be assessed for both
periods.
i The main disadvantage with
this type of benefit is the time it
can take for your money to arrive
•(anything from 1 to 9 months! It
| is worth keeping in touch with
your Housing Authority since
some of them have a discon-
certing habit of temporarily
'losing' claims if it can save them
the trouble of processing them. If
you do have particular diffi-
culties with your claim, call into
Student Services and we should
be able to help coax authorities
into action.
Although all the details in this '
article are to the best of my
knowledge, correct at the time of
going to press, confusion still
reigns amongst the Housing
Authorities and it is quite likely
that individual officers at the
Town Halls may give contra-
dictory advice to students. The
safest way to avoid confusion is
to follow the basic rules outlined
below:
1. If you are remaining in
London over the vacation 'sign
on' through the DHSS.
2. If you are leaving London
for the vacation use the Standard
Housing Benefit system.
3. Return all forms and reply
to all letters from the Housing
Authority promptly and clearly.
4. Conduct all communica-
tions by post with the relevant
authority and keep copies of all
letters sent.
