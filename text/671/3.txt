Dear Mr Ghosh
I noted with interest the lack

ANNOUNCEMENTS
•IC Wlndband needs players for the
'1812' concert next term. If you can
blow, see us on the Queen's Lawn
1:00pm Tues or turn up with your
instrument 5:45pm the first Monday
next term in the Great Hall. Further
details Mike Hodgson, Physics 3.
Manager, was told at Bar
Committee and by various
other people that he would
make a severe loss on Beers (incl
lagers and Guinness). With the
price of a pint down 12p a pint
and free paper cups(3p each), at
least 15p was being thrown
away for every pint served. It
has been calculated that over
7,000 pints were sold giving a
loss in takings of around
£1,200. The paper cups used
contain about 1.0501 pints
compared to that put in glasses
of around 0.95 pint (including
head). This increases the loss
made to around about £1,500.
Most of which went to the
hundreds of outsiders present
with little benefit to I C stu-
dents. The paper cups are a
severe problem, I know glasses
cannot be used but a better
system or different containers
should be employed. I know it is
impossible to fill the cups to a
pint as I have some experience
in this matter. A t a time when
refectories make losses to be
subsidised by the bars M r
Mooney is throwing away vast
sums of money. He would have
done just as well if he wanted to
get rid of £1,500 to do some
slight price reductions (2p pint)
till the end of term or have given
the £l,000-£ 1,500 to IC Rag.
I am convinced now tht M r
Mooney has gone soft in the
head and should be retired as
soon as his current contract
runs out.
Yours

Dear Pallab
I note with interest the com-
ments made in Gareth Fish's
letter on the pricing of bars at
Carnival. I do not know that M r
Mooney was told he would
make a 'severe loss'. I certainly
don't remember 'severe losses'
being mentioned at B a r
Committee but then neither do
I remember Gareth being
present.
The Finance Section and I
are presently analysing the
effect of the Bars Promotion
Week on profitability and
turnover as an exercise in selling
cheap beer for a limited period.
Your readers may like to
consider that on a Carnival

A problem in the statistics of
microscopy: a plane section through a
specimen of rock or soil or biological
tissue shows irregular features when
viewed down a microscope. We can
measure some of what we see and wish
to estimate the total length, surface
area, volume, etc of the entire set of
features and not just those seen.
Simple methods of measuring in the
section are to be compared using
mathematical modelling of the
features.
