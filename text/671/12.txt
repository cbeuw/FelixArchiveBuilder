WELLSOC—20 Years on
H G Wells
'The acquisitive fool with his
money bags, the priest with
his prayers and incantations,
the straining girl in the
factory, even the lad in the
stoke hole of the labouring
ship or behind the tommy
gun, can do nothing against
our supreme enemyjgnor-
ance.Knowledge or ext-
inction. There is no other
choice for man.'
H G Wells(t866—1946).novelist
and social reformer.gained a free
studentship to the Nornal School
of Sciencejater to become the
Royal School of Science.He
studied biology under Thomas
Henry Huxley.who had a great
influence on much of his work
and ideas.He attended Imperial
for four years.During this time
his work,originally brilliant,
became steadily worse, until,
disillusioned with his Professor,
he failed his geology finals. He
became a strong critic of Imperial
College.
Wells believed in social and
scientific interests being catered
for inside the College system, he
wrote:
'There is an ineradicable
tendency in sound technology to
go on to purely scientific interest
and breadth of social thought,
the higher centres will keep on
breaking through, and South
Kensington, in spite of itself, does
a great deal of read University
work and makes men of many of
its technicians. But so far the
recognition of this tendency in
any organised form has been «
successfully resisted.'
In the Beginning
In January 1963 the first move
to form a society based on this
Many students at Imperial College have no idea of what
Wellsoc is, and why it exists. The HG Wells Society of Imperial
College was founded twenty years ago this session, to conquer
ignorance, broaden people's horizons and release them from
the narrow confines of academic life.
idea, was made; Sinclair Goodlad
M A wrote to the president of the
National H G Wells Society
asking their permission to use
Wells' name for the new society.
H G Wells was chosen as the
'patron saint' of the society
because of all Imperial College
alumni, his interests most nearly
coincided with those of the
society but '...he is our excuse
rather than our motive.'
Aims
Broadly speaking the H G Wells
Society—Wellsoc for short—has
three main aims. Firstly, it aims
to give students in the various
departments an opportunity to
hear about interesting work
being undertaken in the fields of
science and technology other
than their own.
Secondly, it explores the
i n t e r a c t i o n b e t w e e n the
discoveries of science and the life
of the community, and hence the'
'shape of things to come'.
Thirdly, it will examine
subjects which are on the
borderline between science
fiction and science fact.
After the Beginning
Membership of the society grew
from 1963 onwards under the
presidency o f first Sinclair
Goodlad M A (now Dr Goodlad
EE), then Lord Jackson of
Feature
a t t e n d a n c e s of 950 a n d
membership reaching 1,150,
making it the largest society in
the University of London.
For four years membership
remained high (900 in 1974),
however in 1979 membership
had fallen into single figures and
under the u n e n t h u s i a s t i c
chairmanship of Frank James,
the society collapsed.
In 1981 the society was
relaunched, with Prof Eric
Laithwaite (EE) as president, by a
hard core, including Pallab
Ghosh (Chairman). The first
issue of the 'Wellsian'—paper of
Wellsoc—appeared soon after.
M e m b e r s h i p increased to
approximately 550.
Lecutres have always been
held on Monday evenings at
7:30pm hence the society slogan
'Monday Night is Wellsoc Night'.
Lectures were varied, ranging

FRS gave the opening lecture of
the session 1968-69 on 'The
Strength of England' which
packed out the Great Hall. He
was invited to become president
in 1970, after the death of Lord
Jackson; he accepted and
returned in October to lecture
on 'The General Trend in
Transport'.
This lecture was the peak in
the society's history with

from 'Relativity', 'Science for
Crime' to 'Gambling' and ' A n
Anatomy of Laughter', many by
well known people. Dr Magnus
Pyke, Yuhudi Menuhin, Michael
Bentine and Prof Sir Herman
Bondi. The lectures were-
supplemented by film showings
including 'Freaks' a film banned
from England for thirty years,
and Village of the Damned a film
based on John Windham's
'Midwich Cuckoos'.
Study Groups
Many specialised groups were
set up in the society, such as
UFOs, ghosts, and the electronic
music group, to study in detail
their own subjects. Some of
these groups formed into
societies when Wellsoc collapsed
in 1979—Graffitti, and Science
Fiction Society which are still in
existance today.
The Future
Next year the society has once
again an enthusiastic committee,
if a little inexperienced, and
lectures have started on Monday
evenings, on a regular basis.
Perhaps the society will again
become 'THE' society in Imperial
College.
