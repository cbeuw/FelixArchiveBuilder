The Whole World at a flick of a Switch.
•What is H A M S O C ?
H A M S O C is IC's Amateur
Radio Society and is affiliated to
the RSGB. It offers excellent
antennae placement—and help
for those wishing to become
radio amateurs.
•What do Radio Amateurs do?
Amateur radio provides a
universal friendship between
people of like minds all over the
•world. Contact with places such
as the Falkland Islands and
Grenada is possible when no
other means of communication is
available. Radio Amateurs are
often first with news of civil
disturbance in places under
communications blackout.
Radio Amateurs do not simply
send Morse—they are involved in
voice-transmissions, television,
c o m p u t e r - g e n e r a t e d d a t a
transmission, etc.
•What does H A M S O C offer its
members?
The Society has a station with
equipment available for use by
members, at any time, under
Callsign C5YC or G 8 E Y C ; one
simply exchanges a current
membership card for the shack
key at Beit Security. Our
Chairman encourages members
to make use of the log-book and
to hunt around. However, note
that one does need a licence in
order to transmit.
•What more is there to Hamsoc?
If you wish to obtain a licence to
transmit, then, through City &
Guilds, the Club offers entry to
the R A E examinations without
charging centre-fees. We can
order from the RSGB's range of
books at 25% off publishers' list
prices.
For those wishing to learn
Morse code to PO test standard
(12wpm) or better, help is at
hand! Morse tuition records hide
in some dusty filing cabinet and
we also have a Morse tutor and
key for loan to members.
We enter contests whenever
members can be encouraged to
participate—we hope you'll be
interested—and we've organised
trips to the B B C T V centre, B B C
Radio London, the • Faeroes—
and Harrods; for afternoon tea!
Suggestions for guest speakers/
visits are welcomed.

and 430MHz power- and pre-
amplifiers are to be located by the
antennae, along with a 1.3GHz
transverter. This system already

Civ Eng JSoc
I'd like to thank all who attended
the annual Civ Eng Dinner last
Thursday at the Big Apple
Restaurant, South Kensington.
The food was good and in large
portions, and seemed to be
enjoyed. There was plenty of
wine as I managed to come away
with eleven bottles I'd bought as
spares, however I apologise for
running out of red wine.
Although the dinner was
poorly attended (33, about half
students), it appeared to be a
success, for those attending, and
hence I would recommend the
Big Apple for any club organising
a dinner (please contact me if any
club want me to expand on
details if considering the Big
Apple).
TRANSPORT
There will be yet another ICU
Transport meeting on
Thurs 22 March
(note change of date)
at 5:30pm in the
Union Upper Lounge
Please make sure that all club
transport details are returned by this
afternoon.
If you don't have a seder service
to go to (whether progressive,
orthodox or somewhere i n -
between), for the first and/or
second nights, it should be
possible to find a family for you
to visit. Please contact me as soon
as possible, via IC Union Office
in Beit, if you are interested.

• • • H i Wednesday,
Oxfam
This Friday, 16 March, Oxfam is
launching its special London
Easter Appeal throughout all its.
sixty shops in the Greater
London area.
In 1984, we are looking for
s o m e t h i n g a l i t t l e b i t
special—jewellery.
Many people have a few pieces
of jewellery bought years ago
which today is never worn or
taken out. Why not give it to
Oxfam? They can then sell the
item and use the money to help
the millions of families, men,
women and children overseas
who might otherwise suffer from
malnutrition or disease, or
indeed starve, without this help.
Oxfam is appealing to students
to have a special sort-out of their
jewellery (any type) and give
something to Pxfam for Easter.
Readers can give in jewellery to
any Oxfam shop in London.
Check the phone book for the
one in your own area. Otherwise,
ring Oxfam on either 876 3399 or
348 4225.

If anyone wants to come and sell
Rag Mags at Royal Holloway
College this afternoon then find
myself (Dave Parry) or Dave
Watson now, because we're
leaving at 1:00pm.
Silwood tickets are now on sale
from the R C S U Office so run
along with a cheque book to us
now.
The Amsterdam trip is leaving
on Friday so if you feel like
escaping to the continent for a
weekend then go and see Dave
Watson or Ian Thomas about the
trip or drop a note (and £10
deposit) into the Ents pigeonhole
in the R C S U Office.
Finally, have a spondiferous
Easter and don't come back
without at least one idea for the
Rag Fete.
Happy St Georges Day.
