A Star Performance
Dramsoc's major production of this term The Life and Times of
Galileo proved a resounding success last week. A total of 320 people
watched one of the most professional pieces of drama to be seen in
College for some years. There were strong performances from all of
the large cast, especially Michael Bridgeland as the lead who was
rarely off stage. The probems caused by the large number of scenes of
short length, and also the large number of characters, were
convincingly overcome. This allowed the humour and irony of the
excellent script to be portrayed to the full by the clear delivery of all
members of the cast, even those in small roles.
The quality of the acting was complemented by the specially
constructed set. The monolithic concert hall was transformed with
the stage being extended by a series of distinct levels, to the floor. By
enclosing the theatre with black curtains, the atmosphere created by
the play was perfectly enhanced. ,
Considerable credit must go to all involved in such a complex
production, especially director Matthew Chevassut and the producer
Mark Priestley. This was a most appropriate way to end a successful
year for the society.

Anchors
Aweigh
RCS U n i o n stole Chelsea
College's mascot, a large heavy
anchor, early yesterday morning.
At present there is no indication
as to what the ransom for the
mascot is likely to be. However
Chelsea College do not seem keen
to have it back. In an interview
with F E L I X the Chelsea College
President said "I hate the bloody
thing". It appears that they will
make no effort to get it returned
until next term.
Last week R C S received
information about the location of
the mascot. The mascot was
taken from a deserted Chelsea
College Union by about 35
mascoteers.
The mascoteers entered the
union by telling a cleaner that
they had come to take the anchor
for cleaning. They then rushed
the anchor passed an annoyed
security guard to a waiting van.
