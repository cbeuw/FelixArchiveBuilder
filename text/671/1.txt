NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
DIAL M FOR
PRESIDENT
College Secretary Mr John Smith has given his support, in
principle, for the Union to run the Union Lower Refectory next
year. The refectory will be run by a newly appointed Catering
Manager who will be answerable to the Deputy President and a
catering committee consisting of student representatives and a
staff treasurer. meeting it will then be referred
For the past two years the to the Rector's Policy
Union Refectory has been
generally acknowledged to be
the worst of all the College's
refectories. More complaints
about the quality of food have
been received from the Union
Refectory than any other, and
it has been making a loss for
some time. Until the Union's
proposal had been put
f o r w a r d , it h a d been
suggested that the Union
Refectory should be closed
and the Lounge Bar would be
extended to cope with the
extra demand for food.
The plans were revealed to
M r Smith yesterday morning
by IC Union President
Gaynor Lewis and Deputy
President Christine Teller. In
an interview with F E L I X , M r
Smith described the Union's
proposal as 'well thought out
and well d o c u m e n t e d ' .
He also said that the success
of the bookshop and refec-
' tories in other Student Unions
showed that there was no
reason why IC Union should
not run a refectory success-
fully. However, he said that he
had reservations about the
fact that sabbaticals would
change each year and that this
would be a weakness.
The plans will now be
considered at the next
refectory committee meeting.
If the idea is approved at the
NO 671 MkwmmakWBaww
Committee for final approval.
Plans to take over had been
drawn up as early as August
last year by Miss Teller and
Miss Lewis. Lack of adequate
financial data about the
individual refectory outlets
prevented a proper case being
prepared and the plan was
shelved. However there was
little improvement in the
quality of food and it was
decided to press ahead with
the takeover early this term.
Christine Teller, Gaynor
Lewis and Hugh Southey,
Internal Services Chairman
drafted a .revised document
for a takeover. This was then
approved at a recent ISC
meeting by all the sabbaticals.
If the refectory is to be
under Union control next year
it will be run as a fast food
snack bar, serving pies,
pasties, beef burgers and a
wide range of sandwiches.
However plans have not been
finalised. If College gives
permission, a wide sample of
student views will be sought
about type of food that should
be served.
The proposed date for the
handover is 31st July. This is
designed to coincide with the
end of the college's trading
year. The Union will aim to
start serving at the start of
September.
" • H H H FELIX. March
Maribcl Ander»on, Ladies Rugby captain, was elected
Guilds President at yesterday's Guilds UGM. Miss
Anderson, who is pictured above, says her main policy
for Guilds is to involve more people in the union's
activities. Last nigH she showed that she was not just a
pretty face by finishing off a yard of beer in the Union
Bar.
The election result was somewhat of a surprise as it
had been widely believed that Steve Nixon would be
elected. Ian Joesbury was the other candidate for
President.
Guilds Union had 28 people standing for seven posts
on their executive. As a result, the elections went on late
into the afternoon.
In the other elections, Ian Joesbury was elected Vice-
President and Simon Chamberlain was elected Hon Sec.
