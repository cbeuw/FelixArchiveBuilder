LETTERS Scribblers' Corner
The Good
Doctor Replies
Dear Sir,
It was good to read Anjana Ahuja's
letter pointing out that there are all sorts
of ways apart from beta blockers and
other drugs to deal with the adverse
effects of excessive stress, including
examination stress. We at the Health
Centre have been providing counselling
and psychotherapy for years with just this
in mind. This year we innovated an
examination stress workshop run by one
of our visiting counsellors. However, beta
blockers can be very helpful in some
cases and it is in those cases, after
discussion of the various alternatives, that
1 prescribe them. They are certainly only
one of a variety of approaches. The
reason why I focused only on beta
blockers was that in my original short
article for the British Medical Journal that
is what I was asked to do.
Yours faithfully,
Dr R Gillon, Director, Imperial College
Health Service.
