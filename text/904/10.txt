Curve: Interview MLSIC
Corr, a bit of luck
and a smile can
get you anywhere.
After the Boo's
interview at ULU
Dominic went
home (prior
engagement, 36-
24-36) and I went
fishing for the ever
so lovely Curve
people, hoping I
might steal the
odd few minutes
with pop's new
kids on the block.
And what do you
know, Santa
Clause does exist
after all etc...
So tell me Tony (-yes, it was HER. I
had Tony to my very own little self!!)
all there is to know about Curve SVP.
Well, we are a band of 5 individuals, all
completely different and it's exciting.
Are the upper echelons of the charts
your one true goal?
Too fucking right (eekt). I can't really see
it happening unless there's a dramatic
change in the approach in the way
people accept music in this country. But
may be it will be like that, its difficult to
say. All the bands in this country that I
really love aren't successful...there's no
need for it. What they're doing is actually
new...which is a drawback.
So the music you make is solely for
yourself?
I don't think you can make music for
anyone else. Most musicians do it to cure
their own frustrations.
Has critical success altered the you as
a person?
Oh no, not yet, it obviously hasn't done
yet. You have ideals, but its a myth that
you don't change especially with the
pressure you are under, you'd be fucking
insane if you didn't change. Morally and
fundamentally they are using us, and so
we are in it for all we can get.
We've had to cope with so much shit.
After our first gig a young kid came up
to me and said, "You're fucking crap. If
that's your first gig, how did you get in
fucking Melody Maker". Obviously we
were upset, but this kind of thing does
make you change. But this is nothing,
because we are just at the beginning. We
are like little puppies growing (ahh, so
sweet). We are really excited by
everything and enjoying ourselves at the
moment.
How do you feel about your
recordings so far?
We obviously want people to like our
records, but we just put it out because we
liked it.
There's a good possibility of the new
single charting, did you plan on
success so soon?
No, I still don't think that will happen. I
never believe anything until I see it. I
can't really think any other way. You
never really think about it before hand.
You can't really. This is what I want to
do. We were on SnubTV the other week
and I really loved it.
Can you make money out of what you
are doing?
Yes, you can, because we have a record
deal, but you don't make money out of
the records. We get a cash advance from
the record deal, but we don't get any
money from the actual records. If we
don't sell any records, then obviously
they'll (Anxious) drop us, but if we do sell
records then you can make a lot of
money. We don't make money from tours
at all. Not at this level, but it does raise
your profile and mainly because we want
to do it anyway. The record company are
good about us wanting to support bands
and when we want to go in the studio.
Then I couldn't resist, the sinful,
sinful clicked question. Influences?
Yo the mc5 (just kidding, Dominic was
insistant), the band listen to Stones (big
fan) , Lenny Cohen (cool dude) and
anything to do with Punk. I've always
been mad about music, I've always
wanted to be a singer. I feel very lucky
because I'm doing what I want to do.
