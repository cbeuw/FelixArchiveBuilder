Over Her Dead Body
'Her' being Enid, a lady with a
penchant for nastiness to her
younger sister June. Enid wears the
kind of chic apparel which would make
Huggy Bear spin in his flares and has a
tongue on loan from a spitting cobra.
June is a Southern belle who unbeknown
(naturally) to her sister is having a
tumultuous fling with Enid's husband,
whom both have known since childhood.
Quite why Harry should have married the
unspeakable Enid rather than the
infinitely preferable June is the only real
mystery in this film.
Thankfully, Enid bites the dust early on,
but unfortunately she refuses to stay
down. Harry deals professionally with the
body by telling June to lose it. June
doesn't like this. She deals with her
personal crisis by putting Enid into her
car, festooned with nylon string to hold
her up, and starts up a conversation on
her way to dump her over a cliff.
Unfortunately it's not that easy. Enid
ran the car dry, and in her attempts to
fend off an over-curious attendant she
locks the keys inside. That's okay,
because Enid opens it for her. June
continues, only to find that the blind
curve already has an upturned chicken
truck spilling happy avians around the
place. Deterred, she carries on to a petrol
station and rings Harry. While she's on
the phone, a gentlemen of the meths 'n'
brown paper bag variety tries to get off
with Enid ..
Subsequent adventures take the two
hapless and helpless assassins around,
down and through New Mexico while
Enid is buried, dumped, nearly (but
thankfully not quite ) shagged and
generally abused, all the time managing
to screw up everything for June in a wide
range of exciting ways. June
metamorphoses from a sweet if somewhat
scatter-brained mademoiselle into a
screeching hellcat; Harry gradually
demolishes his reputation with the police
department for which he works and all
this goes on for some time.
I get the impression that this film is
meant to be a knockabout Burt Reynolds
kind of comedy. If it is, it fails
completely. On the other hand, as a kind
of quiet black comedy it's not bad,
although maybe it goes on too long. Over
Her Dead Body is quite a cool movie.
The Flying Gerbil
The Respectful Prostitute
Killing blacks in southern USA
during the thirties was more a
hobby than a crime. When nine
black men were accused of raping two
prostitutes on evidence described as 'A
mass of contradictions' they were sent to
the electric chair. The affair caused such
uproar that Jean-Paul Sartre in his ivory
tower decided to write a play.
In this play a young prostitute is
molested on a train by a group of white
men. As the blacks on the train try to
defend her one is shot. The killer
happens to be the son of the local
senator and considered an 'upstanding'
man.
The town's people then try to make the
prostitute testify she was raped and saved
by the killer. More surprising is the young
girl's refusal to submit to this bullying.
Only when she is confronted with her
need to belong to a community does she
decide to lie.
Unfortunately this moment of
temptation is the only gripping part of
the play. The senator, like a devil,
seduces her with words which make the
audience share the confusion about which
man she should send to the electric chair.
From Sartre's point of view here is the
crux of this short piece. The way you
view a situation affects the facts. It's a
shame none of the other actors can
match the senator's hellish charm,
narrowness and a mixture of American
and Australian accents blur this message.
The set wobbles precariously throughout
and the cap-guns which are used fail to
go off.
With a play with as much weight as
this one, distractions make the whole
thing look ludicrous. The performance
should be tighter and more confident.
Although the venue (The Etcetera
Theatre, Oxford Arms, Camden) proves
that theatre is not exclusively for people
who drive Bentley's and wear bow ties. A
worthy enterprise but a flawed
production.
