Mistaken philosophers who
cry “All is well”,
Approach, look upon these
frightful ruins,
A hundred thousand wretch-
es swallowed by the earth,
Bleeding, torn, with hearts
still beating,
Buried beneath their roofs,
In racking torment end their
stricken lives...
In 1755, an earthquake struck
Lisbon, causing the deaths of
over 100,000 people. The city
centre was ripped apart by
giant fissures and an enor-
mous tsunami devastated the
harbour. In the ensuing days,
religious priests roamed
the streets hanging people,
accusing them of heresy and
blaming them for the earth-
quake. At the same time, the
Marquis decided to commis-
sion a scientific study of the
disaster. This decision lead
to the birth of the science
of seismology, as well as a
giant leap forward for the
European enlightenment
period, as writers like Voltaire
demanded a more humanist
response to the tragedy.
History repeats itself, but
humans never learn. This
time,theearthquakeoccurred
in south-east Asia. Scientists
knew it was going to happen
and that when it did, it would
be devastating. According
to scientist Brian Atwater
of the US Geological Survey,
“Sumatra has an ample his-
tory of earthquakes... every-
one knew that Sumatra was a
loaded gun.” But nobody took
their advice on board until it
was too late.
Apart from being one of
the most densely popu-
lated regions of the world,
the afflicted areas were also
amongst the most religious.
Without doubt, the disaster
will have shaken the founda-
tions of their faith. Since reli-
gion cannot begin to explain
why or how over 140,000 inno-
cent lives were lost, people
will inevitably, as they did
in Lisbon over two hundred
years ago, demand a more
satisfactory explanation and
scientific measures to pre-
vent losses from such disas-
ters in the future.
The leaders of the affected
countries have now called for
the installation of an early
warning system. This is too
little, too late. It has emerged
that, for decades, they had
ignored scientific advice.
So the most shocking thing
about this event is not that
it happened, but that many
deaths could have been pre-
vented from happening. The
chances are that if the same
tsunami had approached the
coast of Japan, most people
would have been evacuated.
So who provides the
answers in the face of such
cataclysmic events? In cen-
turies past, people used to
explain natural events by
saying that it was caused by
God’s wrath or perhaps some
other supernatural power. An
Anglican priest was quoted as
saying after the tsunami that
“disasters were part of God's
warning that judgment was
imminent”. A Muslim cleric
has said: “The disaster is
God's way of testing human-
kind.” Little consolation, little
solace for the victims.
In the Abrahamic religious
texts, there are numerous
natural disasters such as
floods and plagues of locusts
that were caused by the wrath
of a supernatural bogeyman
(as that prophet of science
Richard Dawkins so often
puts it). Today, however, we
have a better understanding
of how such events occur. We
know exactly how tsunamis
occur and we also know why
they occur. We also have the
technology to predict when
they will occur, and we could
have saved thousands of
lives. We also know why there
are global economic imbal-
ances and why so many peo-
ple live in poverty and do not
have access to the informa-
tion that should have saved
their lives.
So the answer is that there
is absolutely no excuse. The
tsunami disaster was a global
catastrophe and this time we,
not God, are all responsible.
Are you going to say in the
face of the semi-formed cries
Of their expiring voices, in
the face of the spectacle
Of their smoldering remains:
“It is the effect of necessary
laws
That require this choice of a
God that is free and good”?

Lisbon disaster, Voltaire

When asked to name a prom-
inent scientific equation,
E=mc² comes to mind. A
hundred years down the line,
this equation still echoes the
scientific brilliance that was
Einstein.
As a schoolboy, he was
never regarded as a ‘gen-
ius’, but at the age of just
26, Albert Einstein had pub-
lished three papers in a
renowned German physics
journal that made him one
of the most legendary scien-
tists of all time. The papers
focused on Brownian motion,
the photoelectric effect (for
which he won the 1921 Nobel
Prize in physics) and spe-
cial relativity. These papers
were published in 1905 and,
in that memory, 2005 has
been named the World Year
of Physics.
More than 40 physical soci-
eties around the world will
be taking part in the celebra-
tions. In Europe alone, the
UK and Ireland, Austria,
Croatia, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland and
Switzerland will be just some
of the countries involved.
Amongst the participating
countries outside of Europe
are South Africa, Australia,
Korea, India, Malaysia,
Pakistan and the USA. This
is very much an international
affair!
As the UK and Ireland’s
contribution to the world
celebrations, 2005 will be
known as Einstein Year. This
is being co-ordinated by the
Institute of Physics, and hun-
dreds of events and activities
throughout Einstein Year
will promote physics to the
general public.
Einstein Year will be focus-
ing on motivating young peo-
ple about physics, dispelling
common myths and high-
lighting the contribution of
modern-day physics to soci-
ety. Activities will encom-
pass a range of contempo-
rary physical concepts, from
meteorology to gravitational
waves. Events will also be
organised locally by schools,
universities, museums and
community groups to make
physicists, and the work that
they do, more visible to the
public. Einstein Year is also
supported by many well-
known celebrities, including
personalities such as Carol
Vorderman and Sir Patrick
Moore.
As well as events run
by local groups, there will
also be some national out-
reach activities for second-
ary school pupils. The pro-
gramme is still under devel-
opment, but current plans
include a poetry competition,
a Rambert Dance Company
production, a paperclip phys-
ics competition, a lab in a
lorry and an international
poster competition. Science
Week also takes place during
mid-March, and many of the
activities during that time will
be physics-related, including
a celebration of Einstein’s
birthday on 14 March! Check
out www.einsteinyear.org/
events for further details and
to find out what’s going on in
your area.
You can also get involved
by organising your own
events, and if you have
any fantastic ideas, email
einsteinyear@iop.org with
your plans!
Even if you don’t have any
plans of your own, you can
volunteer for various activi-
ties set up by other socie-
ties. PhySoc will be running
plenty of events throughout
Einstein Year, so get in touch
and volunteer. You’re bound
to find something you’ll enjoy,
and I guarantee it’ll be inter-
esting and fun!
Science, religion and a
case of history repeated
Forces of nature:
how tsunamis form
By Tom Simonite
Science communication
Although most commonly
depicted and imagined as
towering waves with a foamy
crest, tsunamis are actually
more like a rapidly rising tide
able to quickly and forcefully
flood coastal areas. They do
not have a developed wave
face like the typical ocean
breaker. The reason is the
very different ways these two
kinds of ocean wave are cre-
ated.
In the same way that blow-
ing on a cup of tea causes rip-
ples to form, a normal wave is
created by the action of wind
on water. Wind travelling over
the ocean creates ripples on
the surface. These give a bet-
ter ‘grip’ on the water so the
wind can have a still greater
effect. The stronger the wind,
and the greater the distance
it blows the waves across the
surface, the larger the waves
become. The distance a wave
has travelled is called fetch
– the larger the fetch, the
bigger the wave. British surf-
ers flock to the north Cornish
coast, where the waves have
travelled across the expanse
of the Atlantic. The English
Channel is markedly less
popular.
When an underwater earth-
quake occurs, a very different
wave is generated. The move-
ment of the sea bed displaces
a large amount of water. In
the case of the Boxing Day
quake, hundreds of cubic kilo-
metres were rapidly shifted
as the seabed jumped several
metres upwards. Despite the
scale of the disturbance, the
tsunami would have initially
been undetectable from air
or sea. While tsunamis trav-
el at around 450 miles per
hour, they have a wavelength
of hundreds of miles and an
amplitude of just a few feet.
Although it is the peaks of
the wave that cause destruc-
tion on reaching shallow
waters, the troughs often get
there first. In many places
hit by the Boxing Day tsuna-
mi, the first sign was a rapid
and dramatic receding of the
water to expose hundreds of
metres of sea bed. A large
number of people who ran
to get a closer look at this
unusual phenomenon, or to
gather fish stranded by the
retreating sea, were early vic-
tims of the subsequent wave.
When tsunamis move into
shallower water, their ampli-
tude increases as the leading
edge of the wave is slowed
by friction with the sea floor
and the rest of the wave piles
up behind it. The decrease
in speed is more marked,
although, as amateur videos
dramatically testify, the waves
still move much faster than a
person can run. The increase
in size is not a large one – the
largest wave to hit shore on
Boxing Day was 30 feet high,
with most much smaller.
Unlike Hokusai’s depiction of the ‘Great Wave Off
Kanagawa’, tsunamis are more like rapidly rising tides
2005: a year dedicated to physics
Feynman, Einstein and Newton’s ideas will be celebrated during 2005, the year of physics
“...motivating young
people, dispelling

highlighting the contri-
bution of modern-day
physics to society”
“While tsunamis travel
