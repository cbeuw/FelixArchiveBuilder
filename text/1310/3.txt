With an overwhelming major-
ity, Imperial College Union
Council has passed a paper
aiming to improve account-
ability of Union officers and
communication throughout
the Union as a whole.
ThePresident,MustafaArif,
received particular criticism
in the paper, and must now
reveal “his exact timesheet
and whereabouts... and the
purpose of those activities for
the benefit of the Union” from
1 September to the present.
He has also been mandated
to apologise to the Council
for irregularities surrounding
recent elections.
The paper raises sev-
eral serious concerns about
the way in which Imperial
College Union has been run
so far this year, highlighting
the following issues: the dis-
appearance of the constitu-
tion from the internet; bad
management at elections; an
under-represented Executive
Committee; alleged inappro-
priate involvement of perma-
nent staff members in Union
activity; a less accountable
style of taking minutes lead-
ing directly to a less account-
abledecision-makingprocess;
and unauthorised increases
in staff costs.
The paper argues that “the
President appears to be in a
position... where he cannot
fulfil his duties effectively”
and that recent management
restructuring “goes explic-
itly contrary to the spirit of
democracy in the Union”.
It goes on to make the con-
troversialclaimthattheUnion
is in breach of the Education
Act 1994, with reference to its
financial situation.
One key issue raised
by the paper was the
‘Redevelopment Masterplan
of the Beit Quadrangle’. A
draft document, prepared
by Imperial College Estates
in November, says that the
Union has already agreed
to make various large-scale
changes to the Quadrangle
before receiving any respons-
es from its recent Strategic
Review questionnaire.
The document states: “The
Student Union wish to incor-
porate into the redevelop-
ment an enhanced catering
and dining facility on the first
floor”, move the offices to
the third floor, create a “non-
alcoholic drink area”, build a
“local authority type council
room” on the third floor in
place of one of the snooker
rooms, and “strip out the
existing gym”.
Mr Arif insisted that the
document was “only a draft,
asking Estates to come up
with some proposals, so that
after the Strategic Review we
can choose an architect and
move forward”. He stressed
that the document was mere-
ly a “starting point for discus-
sion”, no decisions had been
made, and no money had
been paid to any architects.
Dan Lehmann, a mem-
ber of the Union’s Services
Committee, said: “Most peo-
ple believe the Masterplan
and the Strategic Review have
already been written”, imply-
ing that senior Union officers
and staff had already made
their own decisions about the
future of the Quadrangle, and
that students’ views would
not be taken into account.
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
Deputy President (Finance
and Services) and chair of the
Strategic Review Advisory
Group, told Felix: “We
wouldn’t have spent all our
time and effort talking to stu-
dents, putting up posters and
writing articles if the Review
had already been written. I
want the students to get what
they want. When the actual
Masterplan is drawn up, it
will not be the same as the
document from Estates.”
In a separate motion,
the Council subsequently
resolved that the gym would
“remain in its present loca-
tion and not be converted for
any other use unless specifi-
cally authorised by Council”
and that “the snooker room
should not be converted into
a Council chamber”.
The President is now man-
dated to “explain how a docu-
ment outlining the desired
plans for the Union building
dated November was passed
to three architectural firms,
whilst the consultation period
amongst students did not end
until December”.
He must also “update
Council on the progress made
with regards to finding the
estimated £37,000 shortfall on
the management restructur-
ing process”.
The Council Chair, Danny
Sharpe, was mandated to
“ensure a reliable up-to-date
copy of the Constitution” is
posted on the Union website
“within one week of passing
this motion”. He must also
“re-open the investigation
into the financial irregulari-
ties... and ascertain whether
there is a case to answer that
the President may have acted
irresponsibly to the point of
gross misconduct”.
Finally, an amendment
was made forcing the min-
utes from the high-level
Management and Planning
Group to be made public.
Tom Tibbits, who pro-
posed the paper, told Felix:
“The main thing I wanted to
achieve was that the account-
ability of the Union is restored
to where it should have been.
The students will now be
consulted about the future of
their Union.
“I was absolutely gutted
about the lack of transpar-
ency that the Union has
achieved so far this year. I’ve
got to say that Mustafa Arif in
particular has been grossly
negligent in his capacity as
President to represent the
students and not himself.”
Responding to the sweeping
condemnation of his actions,
Mr Arif said: “I accept we
could have handled this a lot
better... [but] I did not lie to
anyone in any aspect.
“I can understand why
people think that the Union
is suffering from a lack of
accountability and democra-
cy, but that view is misguided.
The Union suffers from over-
governance, and... sometimes
you need to realise that dem-
ocratic processes can actu-
ally hold up democracy.
“I look forward to the
opportunity to put together a
response and to disprove the
allegations of impropriety in
the paper.”

as ‘Beit Masterplan’ is discovered
Mustafa Arif (centre), President of Imperial College Union, gives an initial response to allegations of impropriety
According to a draft document dated November,
Imperial College Union wishes to:
● Build new offices on the third floor
● Create a local authority-type council room
on the third floor in place of one of the snooker
rooms
● Strip out the existing gym
● Change Da Vinci’s into a non-alcoholic drinks
area, a “Starbucks type café”
● Incorporate into the redevelopment an en-
hanced catering and dining facility on the first
floor
The Union’s Strategic Review process, in which
students were consulted on these issues via a
questionnaire, did not finish until December – long
after the draft document was produced
“The draft document is merely a starting point for
discussion. Nothing has been decided yet”

‘REDEVELOPMENT MASTERPLAN OF THE BEIT QUADRANGLE’
By Dave Edwards
A hotel in Kensington could
provide the solution to
Imperial College students’
accommodation problems,
offering beds from just £5 per
night.
The hotel, in Lexham
Gardens, was founded by
Stelios, the serial entrepre-
neur and owner of easyJet,
easyCar and other related
companies. It will be known
as an easyHotel, providing
no-frills, low-cost accommo-
dation. Customers can book
rooms on a website with a
credit card, on a ‘book early,
pay less’ basis. Prices will rise
in periods of high demand.
With Imperial students’
hall fees and rent costs ever-
increasing, the development
of the hotel has raised the
possibility that students could
book rooms for months at a
time. They would be able to
stay in hotel accommodation
and, potentially, save large
amounts of money.
Hall fees currently range
from £54 to £127 per person
per week (approximately),
and renting in the private
sector can cost a student well
over £100 per week. Compare
this with £5 per night, and
therefore £35 per week, dur-
ing the cheapest periods at
the easyHotel, and you can
see the attraction.
Sam Rorke, Imperial
College Union’s Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare) told Felix: “I’d like
to see what’s on offer for £5
a day.” Comparing the cost
of staying at the easyHotel
to that of living in a hall of
residence, Mr Rorke added:
“There’s more to living in
halls than just a bed. There’s
a community, there’s security,
and there are social activi-
ties.”
A spokesman for easyGroup
said: “You will be interested
to hear that even without
advertising or marketing, the
power of the brand is result-
ing in reservation requests
arriving regularly.”
The hotel in Kensington
is due to open in the sum-
mer, with around 30 rooms.
In due course, the com-
pany expects to expand
easyHotel into more cities,
countries and continents.
