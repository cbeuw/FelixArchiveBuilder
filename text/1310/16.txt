It seems everyone wants to make
a film from a kid’s book these days,
and why not? They are often the
best, and Lemony Snicket’s A Series
Of Unfortunate Events is no excep-
tion.
One of Lemony Snicket’s famous
books has come to life thanks to
Jude Law. He plays the author him-
self, reading the story in the most
mystical voice, providing all the
enchantment and magic the film
needs. The film occasionally cuts
out to Lemony Snicket’s shadow as
he tells the terrible tales.
Snicket sets the scene with: “This
is not a happy film. If you wish to
watch a film about a happy little elf
then you still have time to leave the
cinema.” I was excited – this wasn’t
going to be the usual type of movie.
The Baudelaire children are
exceptional. Violet Baudelaire
(Emily Browning) is an inventor.
Klaus Baudelaire (Liam Allen)
reads books, millions of books, and
remembers the contents of every
single one. Sunny Baudelaire, the
youngest of the three, likes to bite
things.
The children are now the
Baudelaire orphans, after a mysteri-
ous fire killing their parents, mean-
ing that Violet will inherit a huge
fortune on her eighteenth birthday.
The orphans are sent to their uncle,
Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who is only
after them for their huge inherit-
ance and will do anything to get it. It
is up to the children to stop him.
The director, Brad Siberling, made
an excellent adaptation of the book,
producing a film with magnificent
scenes and an otherworldly feel.
Each setting is beautifully twisted
from one of the pages of the book.
Each scene is full of fantasy and
imagination. All the characters are
cast perfectly.
Another example of the great
adaptation from book to film is that
in the books baby Sunny’s quarks
and ga-gas are given as translations,
but in the films they are subtitled
and provide many laughs. This was
the first time I had ever laughed at a
toddler in a film for their humorous
lines, even though the youngster in
Look Who’s Talking did come very
close.
This brings me on to Jim Carrey.
He overshadows everyone else in
the film, yet again stealing all the
best lines and every good scene. It
would not have been the same film
without him – no one else was up
to the standard to play the intense,
overpowering Count Olaf, who is
brought to life in a powerful and pas-
sionate way.
Violet and Klaus portray the chil-
dren in the most mature way, really
suiting the parts they are playing.
Just like all good fantasy films, there
are quirky and unusual characters
everywhere that will keep you enter-
tained. Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly)
and Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep)
are two such characters.
This is not your traditional kids’
story – everything is not always
happy and rosy in Lemony Snicket’s
A Series Of Unfortunate Events, as
the title tells you.
There are a lot of unfinished end-
ings, which can leave you slightly
agitated. However, this is a family
film that will introduce a lot of peo-
ple to the books. A good fantasy film
for all. Melissa Parkinson

More flying ninja warriors
Zhang’s new release is breathtakingly beautiful but has its flaws
Zhang Yimou’s House of Flying
Daggers takes place during the
decline of the Tang Dynasty in 859AD
and follows captains Leo (Andy Lau)
and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) on their
mission to bring down one of the
most prolific rebel groups in China,
the House of Flying Daggers, who,
like Robin Hood, steal from the rich
to give to the poor.
Jin and Mei (Ziyi Zhang), a
woman from the House of Flying
Daggers, disguise themselves in
order to seduce each other in mutu-
ally opposed attempts at infiltration,
entrapment and ambush. Both plans
work, but Jin and Mei also fall in love
with each other, which screws eve-
rything up. We never find out what
the political outcome is; the movie
concentrates on the complications
between Jin and Mei, as well as
Mei’s other love interest Leo, also a
double agent.
Many movies have combined a love
story with martial arts action, but
the love story has to be compelling
to work well, and this one doesn’t
really take off until the movie is
almost over. Even with all the grav-
ity-defying leaps and the charac-
ters’ superhuman abilities, the most
unbelievable element in Zhang’s film
is the love story. In spite of that, it’s
still a movie worth seeing.
The movie places a lot of emphasis
on style and it is certainly gorgeous,
especially Mei’s dance at the begin-
ning. Other highlights are the Echo
Game, in which Mei stands within
a circle of upright drums which she
has to strike with the exceptionally
long sleeves of her robe in the same
order as they’re struck by pebbles. I
know it doesn’t sound like much, but
trust me, it’s the film’s most memo-
rable moment.
This is only Zhang’s second wuxia
film. Once again, he uses a minimal
cast of characters, but those that
found Hero’s narrative somewhat
confusing will appreciate his more
linear approach to storytelling.
Zhang has proven that he is a mas-
ter at turning celluloid into canvas.
Coupled with sparse dialogue and
straightforward narratives, his films
are comprised of frame after frame of
breathtaking beauty. Unfortunately,
he succeeds in neglecting a crucial
point of character development, one
that cannot be compensated for by
fast-paced fight scenes or gorgeous
swirling snow.
The most notable missing element
from the crew of Hero is cinema-
tographer Christopher Doyle, who
brought so much to the look and
feel of Hero. Without him, the action
scenes are filmed with far less style
and flair, and the colour palette
seems more muted, sticking to the
earthier greens, yellows and browns
found in nature. There are plenty
of action set-pieces involving flying
ninja warriors and, of course, some
serious dagger-tossing, but the focus
on Jin and Mei makes it feel quite
drawn out.
Don’t get me wrong, House is a
gorgeous film, almost as striking as
Hero. Avoid getting too distracted
trying to keep track of the charac-
ters’ changing agendas, and enjoy
the production design, costumes
and landscapes. All are sublime.
The fights are amazing ballets,
but what was breathtaking in The
Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon is getting old. If your heroes
can literally do anything, it tends to
suck the tension out of their confron-
tations. It also leads to unintentional
laughs, as in the bizarre case of
a character that won’t stay dead,
which in my opinion really ruined
the film by turning it into a comedy.
How many death scenes is one per-
son allowed, anyway?
It’s an impressive undertaking, to
combine music and dance, sumptu-
ous visual design and violent action
– reason enough to see it on the big
screen, as it just won’t be the same
on your television – but the material
is kitsch.
On its own, House is a marvel-
lous and beautiful film, but follow-
ing on the heels of Hero and even
Crouching Tiger, something is lost.
Instead of being another truly great
film from Zhang, it’s simply a very
good one. Haj Alttahir
