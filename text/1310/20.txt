Warwick 1st 12
Imperial 1st 2
The IC Devils descended
upon Lea Valley ice rink for
a league game against the
Warwick Panthers.
There was a motley crew
from Imperial, including four
players who had never played
a match before. The standard
bunch of criminals showed
up on behalf of Warwick,
including a prepubescent
Canadian.
The match started with a
bump, and before a goal was
scored, the first of three fights
broke out. Carlos was cow-
ardly rammed from behind
against the wall, and justly
retaliated. The Warwick play-
ers’ strength was in numbers,
and two of them joined the
fray against the IC Devil.
However, the Devils decided
that it was (a) a long way
to go for a punch up, (b)
Carlos didn’t need any help,
and (c) Carlos didn’t deserve
any help, so they stood back
and watched the ramming
develop until the King Sized
Ref separated them with a
crowbar. Carlos earned him-
self five golden minutes in the
penalty box for his efforts, as
did the Warwick player.
The game was scrappy, with
the Panthers using every dirty
trick in their very dirty book
of filthy tricks, and due to
some ambiguous offside calls
they managed to sneak in two
goals on the break (then they
got a few more).
This led to the valiant Devils
being 5-0 down at the end of
the period. The second period
saw a great start for the
Devils, with a blinding strike
from Ilya at an unbelievable
angle pulling one back for the
good guys. However, proving
that there is no fairness in
this life, the Panthers scored
a few more, before the next
fight broke out. Yingke had
his head smacked into the
ice, and despite cries of “don’t
retaliate [and kick their heads
in]”, his honour was tarnished
and needed to be regained.
The subsequent action saw
a few more players involved,
and after bashing them off,
the referee sent Yingke off for
a well-earned rest.
The third period lead to
another goal by the IC Devils
team, scored from point
by Tom Andrews, but the
Panthers did get a few more,
leaving the final score at 12-2
in their favour.
Congratulations must go to
(wo)man of the match Ruth
C, the ‘keeper, and also to
anyone who played for the
first time, goalscorers, and
especially Carlos for spend-
ing more time in the penalty
booth than everyone else in
the building combined.
