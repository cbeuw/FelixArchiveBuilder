Happy new year from all at Felix
Welcome to the first Felix of 2005.
I hope you managed to make the
most of the short Christmas break.
The tsunami
Where to begin? I can only offer
my condolences to anyone reading
this who has been affected in any
way by the tragic aftermath of the
earthquake in the Indian Ocean on
Boxing Day.
On pages 2 and 7, we have done
our best to give suitable coverage to
an issue that has, quite rightly, been
almost the sole focus of media atten-
tion for over a week. It may be sev-
eral weeks before we learn whether
or not any Imperial College students
or their families were in the area at
the time. We offer our deepest sym-
pathy to any reader with relatives
who have died or are still missing.
It is particularly tragic that, had
the tsunami struck richer nations
with early warning systems instead
of poorer countries without such
aids, thousands of lives could have
been saved.
It was pleasing, however, to see
students starting Imperial’s fund-
raising effort before the term had
even begun. We will be filling up a
collection tin in the Felix office and
covering fundraising events around
College as they happen. Turn to
Chris Jackson’s article on page 2 to
find out how you can get involved.
Babar Ahmad
In the morning of Tuesday 2
December 2003, I received a tip-off
about an incident in the mechani-
cal engineering building. I went
over and discovered that a room
was being secured and searched
by police officers. A member of
Imperial College staff had been
taken into custody. On the same day,
the Metropolitan Police confirmed
that four men had been arrested
in south west London and detained
“on suspicion of involvement in the
commission, preparation or instiga-
tion of acts of terrorism”.
We broke the news on the Felix
website that afternoon. Other news
organisations would soon take up
the story, which continues to this
day. The man arrested was Babar
Ahmad, a former student and staff
member at Imperial College, whose
situation is now the subject of a
Union campaign.
This matter has generated a con-
siderable amount of debate, not
least at December’s meeting of
Union Council. Should our students’
union come to the aid of a former
Imperial student and staff mem-
ber, who many believe has suffered
terribly at the hands of the police
and the Government? Or should we
steer clear of issues like this and
only concentrate on matters directly
affecting our current members as
students of the College? Convincing
arguments can be made by both
sides. Conflicting opinions appear
on this week’s Letters page (page
10), while Colin Smith (below) gives
more information about Mr Ahmad
and the Union’s campaign.
It remains to be seen whether
the Council’s decision to campaign
for Mr Ahmad’s release will have
any major effect, since several clubs
and societies would have done so
anyway. Given his links with the
College, this could prove to be a
rather unique situation. On the
other hand, it might set an interest-
ing precedent for the future – will
our students’ union be campaigning
on other political or civil liberties
issues too?
Felix
This term, our plan is to continue
to take your student newspaper for-
ward, bringing you more articles,
more detail, more interest and more
entertainment.
A new version of our website (www.
felixonline.co.uk) will launch very
soon, allowing us to improve the
online side of the newspaper. Full
details will be announced shortly.
If you would like to get involved
with Felix, in any capacity, I would
like to hear from you. We have
opportunities in all areas, though we
especially need reviewers and proof-
readers at the moment. If you’re
interested in joining us, email me at
felix@ic.ac.uk.
If you have any comments or sug-
gestions about Felix, don’t hesitate
to get in touch. Finally, best wishes
for a happy and successful 2005.

Freeing Babar Ahmad
At the last Union Council meeting
of term, as has been reported on
the front page, the Council con-
sidered a widely supported motion
(www.union.ic.ac.uk/meetings/files/
paper1-179-1497.pdf) to support the
‘Free Babar Ahmad’ campaign at
Imperial College. After a lengthy
discussion and much debate, the
motion was passed.
This all took place at the most
widely attended Council meeting I
can remember, with the large audi-
ence of students almost unanimous-
ly in support of the campaign. There
was some controversy surrounding
the motion, mainly around wheth-
er or not our Union should take a
stance on issues such as this one.
I hope that once you have looked
into the case, and if you have ever
sat through the frequent farcical
debates that take place at Council
(something I would wish on very
few people indeed) then you, like
me, will be proud that our Union
is getting involved with an issue as
important as the defence of Babar.
The campaign itself was
launched several weeks before, at
a large meeting hosted by three
Imperial College Union socie-
ties: Islamic Society, Imperial
Against Imperialism and Amnesty
International. Over 160 students,
from a wide range of backgrounds,
packed out a lecture theatre to
hear Babar’s father, convenor of
the Stop the War Coalition Lindsey
German, and Yvonne Ridley talk
about the ‘war on civil liberties’
since September 11 2001, in particu-
lar with reference to Babar.
The speakers talked about Babar
being just one of a huge number of
Muslims who have been victimised
in the Government’s attempt to jus-
tify their so-called ‘war on terror’,
the disastrous effects of which are
clearly being felt at home as well
as in countries like Afghanistan and
Iraq. It is for this reason that I would
like to echo the speakers and urge
everyone to join the forthcoming
demonstration in central London on
19 March, the second anniversary of
the start of the war on Iraq.
For those of you who haven’t been
following his case, Babar Ahmad
was a former student and member
of staff at Imperial before he was
arrested under a new extradition
law (which allows suspects to be
extradited to the US without evi-
dence of their alleged crime) for
supposedly being involved with
terrorist activities. He had been
arrested a year earlier for simi-
lar reasons, and released without
charge due to lack of evidence, but
not before being subjected to what
his supporters believe was extreme
physical and verbal abuse at the
hands of police officers. The Union
has resolved to support an inves-
tigation into this alleged abuse.
There is still no evidence against
Babar, and he is now facing a fur-
ther violation of his human rights
as he waits to hear whether he will
be extradited to the US, the land of
the death penalty and Guantanamo
Bay, in a move that could set an
extremely dangerous precedent.
For more information, visit www.
freebabarahmad.co.uk.
With Babar’s case set to be
reviewed in the near future, and
with the recent backlash against
the ‘anti-terror’ legislation follow-
ing the recent, and in my opinion
long-awaited, departure of David
Blunkett, there is much to be done.
In addition to supporting the regu-
lar protests in London, as well as
at the prison where Babar is being
held, action is being planned on
campus. A week of events, hosted
by several of our clubs and socie-
ties, and possibly a central Union
event, have been scheduled for
February. Prior to this, there will be
an organising meeting for any indi-
viduals or society representatives
who want to take part in the cam-
paign, to put their heads together
and draw up a plan of action. The
meeting is likely to be held in the
near future, and anyone who wants
to be kept informed about this, or to
get involved in any other aspect of
the campaign, should email me at
cs602@ic.ac.uk.

Times are a-changing
The new year has brought some
changes for the Imperial College
Union Advice Service.
Firstly, the Advice Service has
been re-located to the East Wing
basement of Beit Quad, which is
now the all-new Student Services
Centre. We have moved to a new
office which is more appropriate for
an advice service and should be
more comfortable for students to
be in.
The new year also brings with it a
new name: the Advice Service will
now be known as The Information
and Advice Centre. We feel that
this sums up what we are trying to
achieve quite well – we are here as
an information giving service and
not just somewhere to come when
all else has failed. We aim to be a
one stop shop for students’ wor-
ries or queries, whether this be a
major case or you would just like
some information on a certain
subject.
We will still cover the following
advice and information areas:
● Academic advice (appeals and
complaints)
● Housing rights advice
● Employment rights advice
● Debt advice
● Consumer rights advice
● Personal safety
● International student issues
● Information on sexual health
The Information and Advice
Centre also has a comprehensive
leaflet library on the above areas
and also on other subjects, such as
drugs, health issues and student
funding.
The Information and Advice
Centre produces its own pub-
licity on student issues. We have
already produced the International
Students’ Guide, and in the new
term we are producing an all-
new Housing Rights Guide, which
should be available just in time for
when you are all looking for some-
where else to live and the end of
the term.
You may also see the new
Information and Advice Centre pub-
licity around campus. We feel that
the changes will help us to con-
tinue to give you comprehensive
advice and information on a range of
subjects.
If you have any comments on
these changes or if you feel that
you need to use the Information and
Advice Centre then please feel free
to contact us on 020 7594 8066 or
email advice@ic.ac.uk.
Hope you had a great holiday!
