Top Exam Tips
1. You Booze, you lose.
Tempting as it is to mask out
the pain of the coming exams with
a bit of the amber nectar, it’s not
going to make you any smarter.
However, your answers will be
hilarious, and you might have a
chance with that foxy lab assistant
with the short skirt.
2. Revise in advance
People who only start revising
while catching the bus to College
will never pass anything. Instead
we recommend you start early,
sometime around 1997, if you want
to be fully prepared.
3. After the exam
Afterwards it’s almost certain
that everybody will say the same
“It was really hard, I only wrote
half a line” stuff, therefore appear-
ing modest and cool. Don’t be like
them, remember, you’re Imperial,
you’re better! Smug self-satisfac-
tion is the way ahead. Laugh at
them, poke them, and remind eve-
ryone just how clever you are.
