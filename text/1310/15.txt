I realise that this review is a little on
the late side, but I wouldn’t want to
deprive people of these, albeit brief,
reflections on the Imperial College
Union Choir’s concert at the end of
last term.
The concert was something of a
new experience for me, as I was
sitting in the audience this time
instead of being up on the stage with
my fellow ladies of the alto section.
The choir is vast, and in all hon-
esty what people say about things
sounding completely different away
from the source of the sound is true
– only in the audience can you fully
appreciate the sound of each sec-
tion and the way they overlap and
interact in the interpretation of the
music.
The concert began in jubilant
fashion with the Hallelujah from
Beethoven’s Mount of Olives. A won-
derfully fun piece to sing, I remem-
ber enjoying it greatly. The choir
looked confident and as though they
were enjoying themselves, and the
mood carried over into the audi-
ence. A very successful way to start
the concert.
Some Bach followed in the form
of the Magnificat. Bach is always
wonderful; the man was a gen-
ius, his music flows with glorious
layers of sound from all quarters
– the orchestra, the soloists and
each section of the choir all have
their chance to shine. Again the
performance was confident. There
were a few moments of restrained
panic when the music’s deviousness
almost requires it, but nothing dire.
The tenor section did themselves
proud – rather lacking in numbers,
they definitely made themselves
heard (which can be attributed to
their, some would say, overpowering
egos, however I’ll leave this to the
reader’s own opinion).
A word on the acoustics of the
Great Hall and the size of the choir
are appropriate at the point. At some
point in one’s career at Imperial, one
must spent some time in the Great
Hall for one reason or another. I
think that we would all agree that
the place is large and not the most
beautiful of spaces. (At this point I
must apologise to my Russian class
as they’ve all been privy to this
particular rant.) The Great Hall has
absolutely no acoustic – it has the
unique ability to crush any sound
trying to make its way from one
region to the next. This unfortunate
effect is most harmful to singers’
efforts. Soloists sing their hearts
out only to have at most half of what
they are trying to convey reach the
audience.
The choir, while it is admirable
that so many people want to sing, is
now almost too large; the bass sec-
tion is now set so far back from the
audience that, at times, between the
distance and the Great Hall effect,
you almost miss them, particular-
ly when they are singing lower in
their voices, which is a shame. The
sopranos, on the other hand, the
largest section in the choir, at times
completely overpower the rest. Yes,
more often than not they have the
tune, but there is a lot more going
on in the music that one would ben-
efit from hearing.
Following a brief interval, the
choir capped off their concert with
Mozart’s Requiem. The Requiem
was never completed by Mozart
himself, and so it has been the task
of others over centuries to try to
fathom what he meant to do. The
version of the score performed by
the choir was the latest ‘comple-
tion and updating’ by Robert Levin,
and had some interesting changes
from that which we are used to
hearing. The various ‘updatings’ of
the score do not change the melo-
dies, but rather, for the most part,
make subtle changes to the orches-
tration.
Again, the performance was
confident and at times the choir
were clearly enjoying themselves.
However, by this point in the concert
the taxing nature of the programme,
and perhaps also the overzealous
nature of some singers, was defi-
nitely beginning to tell in the tenor
section which at times sounded
hoarse.
Just a quick note on the soloists,
before I finish; for the most part
they were wonderful, but there was
one weak link. The soprano, tenor
and bass were all great, in fact the
soprano was truly awe-inspiring,
but the alto was altogether another
matter, sounding completely out
of place when she wasn’t drowned
out.
The choir gave a good perform-
ance of rather varied pieces, show-
ing that they can do the whole range
from jubilant forte to solemn piano,
not to mention stay together while
following the conductor’s break-
neck speeds in fugues.

Better late than never: ICU Choir’s concert just before Christmas
Quite a lot of ramblings this week... it has been a while, humour me
A few words on some other arts-
related topics before I declare that
I’ve said what I’m going to say this
week. I’ll start off with opera, and go
via a couple of exhibitions to a novel
treatment of opera.
The Royal Opera recently did a run
of performances of Donizetti’s opera
buffa, a comedy, Don Pasquale,
Donizetti’s most famous opera being
the somewhat more serious Lucia
di Lammermoor which was per-
formed last season. This particu-
lar outing of a Donizetti opera was
given something of a mixed, and
confusing, reception, especially by
The Times.
The Times, for reasons known only
to its editors, chooses Don Pasquale
as one of their arts events not miss
one Sunday, then runs a review
berating everything about the per-
formance, and then the next week
is once again full of praise for the
opera.
Fortunately, I had booked tickets to
see for myself (it was a tough choice;
see some amusing Donizetti or some
tragic Puccini with Gheorghiu). I
found the performance to be thor-
oughly enjoyable and very funny.
The highly unfavourable review
had said that there was absolutely
nothing amusing about the Royal
Opera’s production, the cast being
about as amusing as watching paint
dry. All I can say is that the reviewer
obviously lacked a sense of humour
or had perhaps suffered a similar
fate as the eponymous Don. The
production was cleverly designed,
the action being set in an over-sized
dolls’ house, and every word could
be understood and their meanings
clearly conveyed by the cast. Unjust
accusations were also levelled at
the singers portraying Norina and
Ernesto. Making her debut at the
House, Tatiana Lisnic was most def-
initely up to the standards expected
by the patrons and, quite frankly,
Juan Diego Florez, a Peruvian tenor,
has one of the most beautiful voices
around – he may not have the power
of some of his fellow tenors but
his voice carried perfectly well and
technically he was very strong.
Two exhibitions are about to close
here in town, and should you get
the chance they ought to be seen.
Firstly, there is the Raphael show
at the National Gallery. This may be
your only chance to see so much by
the artist in one place – of course,
travelling throughout the world to
see the individual pieces of the col-
lection at the galleries from whence
they came would be highly enjoy-
able, but in the spirit of practicality
why not see it all at once?
Secondly, there is a lovely little
exhibition in the Sackler Wing of
the Royal Academy of the work of
the British artist William Nicholson,
a review of which will appear next
week. You will probably recognise
his print of Queen Victoria and some
of those from his series of the alpha-
bet, but his work is not restricted to
this medium – a number of paint-
ings are also featured. If you don’t
fancy seeing something quite as
‘mainstream’ as the Raphael, the
Nicholson is rather interesting.
Now, briefly back to opera. I think
it’s quite obvious that I love the
opera, as was picked up by my fam-
ily this Christmas. The most curious
item of opera paraphernalia that I
received was a set of comic book
opera adaptations from my brother.
While the selection of operas in the
collection is a little on the eccentric
side, those that have been included
have received a very good treat-
ment. So, for anyone thinking about
going to the opera for the first time,
or, I think more usefully, for some-
one who is trying to convince some-
one to go, this particular treatment
may have more success in generat-
ing interest than a copy of Kobbé’s.
The colourful pictures are some-
what more enticing than the very
detailed but slightly dry information
contained in this rather heavy tome,
(though I do recommend Kobbé for
later use, as almost everything is
covered there).
