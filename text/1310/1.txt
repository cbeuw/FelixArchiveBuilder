The tsunami
On Boxing Day, countries sur-
rounding the Indian Ocean
were struck by one of the
worst natural disasters in
history.
There are six articles on the
tragedy, including details of
Imperial College’s response
and how an early warning
system could have saved
thousands of lives.

Library loss?
The popular mechanical engi-

is seen as “a potential solu-

Imperial College Union has
resolved to actively support
the ‘Free Babar Ahmad’ cam-
paign.
Mr Ahmad, a former stu-
dent and staff member at
Imperial College, was arrest-
ed in December 2003 under
the Terrorism Act [see Felix
issue 1279] and subsequently
released without charge. He
was rearrested in August this
year on allegations of involve-
ment in acts of terrorism and
is currently awaiting extradi-
tion to the United States. His
case is due to be reviewed in
the near future.
Mr Ahmad’s supporters
believe that he was abused
by police while in custody, his
human rights may be under
threat if he is extradited, and
he should be given a fair trial
in the UK.
At a Union Council meeting
at the end of last term, when
the decision was made, Colin
Smith, the Union’s Welfare
Campaigns Officer and one of
the motion’s many seconders,
was ejected after shouting
obscenities when it appeared
that the proposal supporting
Mr Ahmad was about to fall.
In a moment of high drama,
Mr Smith called the Council
“a f***ing disgrace” and
was asked to leave by Danny
Sharpe, chair of the meeting.
Mr Smith initially refused to
leave the room, and at one
stage a total of eight College
security officers were present
as various people attempted
to defuse the situation.
Themeetingwasadjourned,
Mr Smith finally left, and
the Council then voted on a
proposal to not consider the
Babar Ahmad paper due to its
“inherently political nature”.
John Collins, President of
the City and Guilds College
Union, said: “My members
say that the Union should not
take a political stance.”
Simon Rawson, Chair of
the Arts and Entertainments
Board, added: “I don’t disa-
gree with this policy, but I feel
deeply uncomfortable about
the Union politicising itself in
this way.”
Mr Smith, before his depar-
ture, had referred to the large
number of people attending
the meeting in support of
Mr Ahmad: “By the strength
of feeling in this room, we
owe it to everyone who has
turned up here to vote on this
motion”.
Eventually, the motion
was considered and passed,
though most Council mem-
bers abstained from voting,
probably due to a reluctance
to engage in a campaign they
viewed as political and not
directly affecting current
Imperial College students.
The paper’s supporters,
however, argued that the
Union’s backing was neces-
sary and appropriate because
Mr Ahmad had studied and
worked at Imperial, and
because any current student
could potentially suffer simi-
lar problems in the future.
Mr Smith later called the
decision to campaign for Mr
Ahmad’s release “a victory
for democracy”.
The Union also resolved
to “ensure that any form of
discrimination experienced
by Imperial College students,
both on and off campus, is
dealt with thoroughly”, “to
campaign for a full investiga-
tion into the alleged assault
on Babar [Ahmad] by the
police officers who arrested
him”, “to campaign for his
human rights to be respected
in court proceedings” and for
Mr Ahmad to be given a fair
trial in the UK.
Several Union clubs and
societies have already begun
to campaign on Mr Ahmad’s
behalf, and a week of events
has been scheduled for
February.
