The mechanical engineer-
ing department’s library and
reading room may close in the
near future, in order to create
space for other departments
or administrative staff.
The library holds books,
projects, exam papers and
solutions in a convenient loca-
tion, and the adjacent read-
ing room is a large open-plan
space with natural light. Both
are popular with students and
are usually full to capacity
during exam periods. Felix
understands that high-level
discussions on the matter
began last term and are set
to continue over the coming
weeks.
A petition against the clo-
sure, signed by over 400
mechanical engineering
students, has been given
to the head of department,
Professor Roderick Smith.
When asked whether or not
the library and reading room
would close, Prof Smith told
Felix: “I don’t know... we are
at a very early stage of dis-
cussion”.
He continued: “It may be
moved, because other people
want to use the space. There
is a huge shortage of space on
campus”.
One option is to move the
collections to the central
library, but this is almost
guaranteed to be unpopular
with students.
In a letter accompanying
the petition, Helen Dawson,
the mechanical engineering
department representative,
outlined the reasons why the
library and reading room are
so valuable to students. The
letter claims that it is par-
ticularly important to have
all projects, exam papers and
solutions available, and that
this access would be lost in
the central library as staff
would not be able to give spe-
cific advice. Also, students
are able to borrow journals
from the department library,
but this is not permitted in
the central library.
Miss Dawson told Felix:
“The library is an invalu-
able source to students at
all stages of their education
at Imperial. Undergraduate
and PhD students alike rely
on the personal service from
Nasim Jensen, which will be
lost if everything is moved to
the central library.
“It’s not only mechanical
engineering students who use
the library and the reading
room – bioengineering and
earth science engineering
students are regular users of
the space.”
Prof Smith said that stu-
dents had been “prema-
ture” in their response and
had acted only on the basis
of rumours. However, he
emphasised that their views
would be “noted and taken
into account”.
In an email to Felix,
Richard Martin, the Faculty
of Engineering’s Deputy
Operating Officer, said of
the reading room: “It is one
area, among many across the
South Kensington campus,
that is being looked at as a
potential solution to a series
of conflicting demands for
space.”
Mr Martin confirmed that
no decision had yet been
taken, and that if the area
was converted for a differ-
ent use, alternative working
space would be provided.

Entrepreneurs Challenge
Manager
The Ideas Challenge prize
giving event took place at the
end of last term. Ten runners-
up and ten winners’ prizes
were awarded to the most
innovative entries.
The Ideas Challenge
is the first stage of the
Entrepreneurs’ Challenge,
Imperial College’s student
business plan competition,
where students are asked to
submit a 2-3 page summary
of a business idea. This year
we had an exceptional 161
entries from 374 of Imperial’s
brightest and most entrepre-
neurial Imperial students,
both undergraduate and post-
graduate, from a variety of
disciplines.
Simon Barnes, Director of
the Entrepreneurship Centre,
hosted the evening and
David Begg, Principal of the
Tanaka Business School,
awarded the ten runners-up
prizes of £250 and ten winners
of £1,000.
Each of the ten winning
teams bravely delivered their
one minute elevator pitch to
the audience to try to con-
vince them of their idea – an
extremely nerve-wracking
task, but they all did a fan-
tastic job!
The next event in the
Entrepreneurs’ Challenge
calendar is the launch of the
New Business Challenge at
6pm on Monday 10 January
in Mechanical Engineering
room 220. The New Business
Challenge is the second
stage of the competition and
offers students the opportu-
nity to present a full business
plan and win a first prize of
£25,000 in cash and services,
one of two runners-up prizes
of £5,000 in cash and serv-
ices, or a finalist cash prize
of £1,000.
Come along and find out
how you can get involved.
Last year’s winners, Jargon,
will be presenting their busi-
ness idea and sharing their
experience of entering the
Challenge. Ex-Imperial
student and ‘Technology
Entrepreneur of the Year
2004’, Charlie Muirhead, will
provide the inspiration.
