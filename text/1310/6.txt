After Prozac stopped work-
ing, Anna tried everything to
cure her suicidal depression.
Eleven types of antidepres-
sants. Two courses of talk
therapy. ‘Life enhancers’
such as frequent exercise and
a good diet.
When the constant cycle of
failing antidepressants and
ineffective therapy became
too much to bear, she had one
option left to her. She was put
under general anesthetic at
Charing Cross hospital and
given a muscle relaxant. Two
electrodes were fixed to her
head, and a small electric
current was passed through
her brain, inducing a mas-
sive grand mal seizure. She
returned the next week, and
after only three courses of
treatment, she emailed her
support group to explain how
she felt:
“Truth is, I feel amazing.
Not 100%, that would be too
much, too soon, but I feel bet-
ter than I’ve felt in ages. defi-
nitely better than I’ve felt in
a long long time. Yesterday,
I was driving home from
the stables with my mum,
and I found myself thinking
that ‘if this change of mind
is going to be permanent, I
may have to rethink my posi-
tion on whether I want to be a
parent’. My position up until
now has been that I can’t
make the commitment to try
to stay alive, so I can’t com-
mit to being a parent. So this
is quite a turnaround.”
The treatment she under-
went was electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT. It is used
by doctors to treat a variety
of mental diseases, primarily
severe depression, and is
widely accepted as being an
effective and safe treatment
by the medical community.
Indeed, for the short-term
treatment of depression, ECT
has been, in trials, observed
to be more effective than
drug therapy. Despite these
findings, there are no waiting
lists for ECT. A patient diag-
nosed with severe depres-
sion is unlikely to be offered
ECT until it is an absolute
last resort, after drugs have
failed and failed again. And
the numbers of patients pre-
scribed ECT treatment is
dropping.
Why should this be so? The
problem, like so much these
days, lies in marketing. The
popular view of ECT is that
of a barbaric treatment, with
vague connotations of tor-
ture, connotations not helped
by media portrayals such as
Jack Nicholson’s treatment in
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest, in which ECT leaves his
character as little more than
a vegetable, or Requiem For
A Dream, where a charac-
ter does not receive muscle
relaxants prior to treatment
and experiences a set of spec-
tacularly disturbing convul-
sions.
These images of ECT may
have stemmed from its rather
sinister history, which seems
to have pervaded all subse-
quent consideration of the
treatment. Italian neurosci-
entist Ugo Cerletti first docu-
mented it in the 1930s, after
observing pigs being given
electric shocks before slaugh-
ter; following the shocks, the
pigs would become manage-
able and quiet. He began
testing this finding on human
subjects, and discovered that
they were rendered calm in
the same way as the pigs.
Unfortunately, he performed
his experiments without
anesthetic or muscle relax-
ants, causing violent, uncon-
trolled spasms, during which
patients would often snap
bones or break teeth. It
became something to dread,
and was sometimes used as a
method of punishment in psy-
chiatric wards for this reason.
Some reports suggest that
ECT was even adopted by
the Nazis for human experi-
ments.
Pig murder, broken bones,
Nazis; already a wonderful
advertisement for any treat-
ment. The major obstacle to
ECT acceptance, however,
turns out to be far simpler
than any of these reasons. It
is a simple lack of knowledge
– that is, no one knows how
it works. Shock a depressed
person, and 60-80% of the
time, they will become hap-
pier, instantaneously. Ask a
psychiatrist why, and he may
mention something about
electrical current stimulat-
ing the production of certain
neurotransmitters; but in
truth this is mostly conjec-
ture. If they could prove this
link then they could say that
ECT “works like Prozac” and
leap some of the hurdles to
acceptance. Without this cer-
tainty, however, the treatment
retains a sense of mystery
that is unsettling for both
patient and doctor.
This is not to say that
there are no documented
side effects associated with
ECT. Early use of ECT saw
application of the electrodes
across the whole brain (‘bilat-
erally’), which often seemed
to result in some short-to-mid
term memory loss. For this
reason, current ECT is usu-
ally performed unilaterally,
with the electrodes placed on
the right hemisphere of the
head. Studies show that there
is no associated memory loss
with unilateral treatment.
Such scientific studies are
rebutted by mental health
charities such as Mind who
have published surveys with
very different findings. In a
2001 survey, they reported
that 40.5% of their respond-
ents complained that they
had experienced ‘permanent
memory loss as a result of
ECT’. This illustrates the
huge differences between sci-
ence’s view and that of the
general public.
While a scientist would
probably point out that people
cannot remember what they
cannot remember and so a
survey is a largely redundant
method of testing memory,
one could reply that if people
perceive a treatment as hav-
ing harmed them, then this is
little different from it actually
having harmed them. Despite
the efforts in this area, then,
the gap between scientists
and the public is once again
exposed. And as fewer people
agree to ECT, fewer doctors
are able to see its effects first-
hand, and so fewer are likely
to prescribe it.
Despite all the controversy,
however, the reply from those
psychiatrists still advocating
its use is as simple as it is
true: ECT works faster than
drugs, has fewer side effects,
and doesn’t hurt. While they
may have little clue as to why
it works, the brewing storm
over anti-depressant side
effects may force both doc-
tors and patients to re-exam-
ine their opinions on ECT and
its effects.
It’s a very odd feeling – like
something is missing. then
when I ask myself what’s
missing, the only thing is
that dark and awful sense
of helplessness and hopeless-
ness which has become my
constant ally. Today I spent
a whole day where this feel-
ing was remarkable by its
absence.
For some patients, like
Anna, the effects can be life
altering.

News
in brief
Californian
biotech firm sells
first cloned kitten
A California firm that ear-
lier this year launched the
world’s first cat cloning serv-
ice has announced its first
sale: a cloned male kitten
named ‘Little Nicky’. Genetic
Savings & Clone – based in
Sausalito, California, and
financed by billionaire John
Sperling – announced that it
had sold the kitten to a Texas
woman for $50,000.
‘Atom school’ in
first Israeli reactor
video
Israel has released the first
video footage of its Dimona
nuclear plant in an apparent
attempt to promote a positive
image of what experts believe
to be an atomic bomb factory.
Channel 10 television said
its tape of the plant showed
technicians in various non-
military activities – mingling
on the lawn, inspecting lab
equipment and lecturing at
an ‘atomic school’ for disad-
vantaged youths.
Russia to stop free
space trips for US
astronauts
Russia’s cash-strapped space
agency said it would stop
giving US astronauts free
rides into orbit in the future.
Russia has single-handedly
serviced the International
Space Station, a $95 billion
orbiting laboratory, for almost
two years since the United
States grounded its Shuttles
after the fatal Columbia
accident.
Quake may have
made the Earth
wobble
The deadly Asian earthquake
may have permanently accel-
erated the Earth’s rotation,
shortening days by a fraction
of a second. Richard Gross,
a geophysicist with NASA,
theorized that a shift of mass
toward the Earth’s centre
during the quake caused the
planet to spin three microsec-
onds faster and to tilt about
an inch on its axis.
Jack Nicholson’s depiction of a patient receiving electro-
shock has contributed to the treatment’s negative image
