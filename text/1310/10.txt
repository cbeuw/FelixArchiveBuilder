Exam anguish
Dear Dave,
I’m a 3rd Year Geology student and
quite frankly it’s a miracle that I can
write to you, our Christmas period
is a joke, we do a modular degree so
every year we have exams the week
after Christmas, it sort of sucks but
makes the summer easier so that’s
okay. This year however with a large
Mapping Dissertation project to do
on top of other modules some stu-
dents have half (8 of 16 modules)
either to be submitted or examined
in the week after Christmas.
Duetomodularweightingifyouare
doing the 3 yr BSc course this could
count for a third of your degree, with
just two weeks to ‘prepare’ (See last
weeks Felix Front page), whereas
over the Easter break you can have
only a third of your year to do after
a 5 week break. With some modules
being split and run twice (once in
autumn term and once in spring
term) with different students, some
students are at an advantage due to
timetabling decisions.
The two week break wouldn’t be so
bad if the department could actually
produce an acceptable exam timeta-
ble! Initially one exam was due to be
sat on Monday 3rd (a Bank Holiday!)
– surely someone timetabling the
exams would have seen this! It was
duly moved but after negotiation
with the students involved it couldn’t
be timetabled in the exam week
– students suggested the Monday
morning of the next week when all
were free, however the department
chose to timetable it on the Monday
lunchtime (see Felix headline two
weeks ago?) which clashed with
some students humanities lectures.
When this was pointed out, they
were given the option of sitting the
exam on the Monday afternoon
– this of course clashes with depart-
ment lectures. The option left to
students is therefore which lecture
to miss to do an exam!
This kind of general incompetence
is typical of the fluid nature of exams
and coursework and the lassiez faire
attitude of staff in our department
and, as recent articles in Felix have
shown, other departments across
the university. With the rector say-
ing that students shouldn’t be repre-
sented on College Council and that
british students aren’t really very
good you really have to wonder if
anyone in this college really cares...

Dear Editor,
My name is shumit das and I am
currently finishing my PhD in the
aeronautics department. I gradu-
ated from the MEng course in Aero
in 1997, which is the same course
that Mr Stephen Message [see Felix
front page, 9 December 2004] is cur-
rently in his final year of.
I would like to respond to the
article about Exam stress, in the
context of Aeronautics as I have
personally had to go through the
same process, along with many pre-
vious year groups. I felt the article
to be an unfair representation of the
workings of Aeronautics as a whole.
The article was written in a way that
suggested the exam timetable had
been altered for this current year
only, to make their life difficult. This
is just not the case.
Mr Message states that “they are
not asking for anything that hasn’t
been given in the past” but that is
not true. The 4th year has ALWAYS
been given 2 weeks over christmas
to revise for the exams. As Prof
Hillier said, it is actually more to
do with coordination with subjects
shared by 3rd year and exchange
students than anything else. Also
4th year projects (which count for
around a ninth of the entire course)
start almost immediately after
the exams. If Mr Message would
like less time to do the most criti-
cal project of his degree then i’m
sure he can have more time for the
exams. Unfortunately then, I am
sure students would be upset about
not having enough time to complete
the critical project.
I am certain that many students
actually find that the time given for
final exams in Aero is just about
enough to get the revision done on
time, in mind of the fact that the
exams only count for 40% of the
4th year – the coursework counts
60%. I know that many students also
get their highest marks during the
course in their 4th year, so I would
suggest that the guys just get on
with it and hand in a sterling project
report and presentation.
I am proud to have been a CAD
and Fortran tutor to many of the
current 4th year in Aeronautics and
I think that almost all of them know
me quite well. I would not tell them
to get on with something if I didn’t
think it were reasonable (they are
free to challenge me on that point).
I am sorry that the exams revision
time is so short but I know that
Prof Hillier would NOT allow some-
thing that was truly unreasonable.
MANY other years have survived
and actually gone on to get really
good degree marks despite this final
exam problem. So I do feel that
Stephen Message and his friends
should really just get and finish the
exams the best they can and real-
ly concentrate on the final project
which counts for so much more.
Good luck 4th years!

Dave Edwards, Editor, replies:
The article on the difficulties suf-
fered by fourth year aeronautics
students was a fair representation
of the situation, featuring com-
ments from students, staff and the
departmental representative.
It was never suggested that the
department had aimed to make stu-
dents’ lives difficult; rather, it was
made clear that this year’s unusual
College term dates were a major
factor.
In each of the past four years,
students have had at least three
weeks over the Christmas break to
revise for exams. It follows that the
present situation is highly unusual
and Stephen Message was entirely
correct in saying: “We’re not asking
for anything that hasn’t been given
in the past”.
Mr Message was by no means the
only student to raise a complaint
about this issue. Revising for six 20-
lecture courses in two weeks would
seem to be an extremely difficult
task.
Our ‘disgruntled rock hunter’
also finds him/herself in an unen-
viable position this week. I would
encourage any student with simi-
lar problems to make their views
known to their departmental rep-
resentative and/or to the Union’s
Deputy President (Education and
Welfare) at dpew@ic.ac.uk. Some
people don’t care, but others do,
and change really is possible in
the future if enough students make
their voices heard.
Babar Ahmad
Dear Editor,
The Union also campaigns against
top-up fees, which is inherently
political. In that case, they use the
reasoning that it affects students
directly, and campaigning is thus jus-
tified. In the case of Babar Ahmed, it
also affects a student directly, and
is thus similarly justified. As a pes-
simist, I have my doubts that the
campaign will have any impact, but
I am proud of the fact that it is being
fought, and believe very strongly
that it is necessary to fight it.

The difference is that top up fees
directly affects students at the
college. When Babar Ahmad was
arrested he was no longer a student
of Imperial College. He was not even
a member of staff as he had left by
the time he was arrested. The union
is not there to support everyone that
has been a student in the past.
There are several outside organi-
sations that are campaigning on Mr
Ahmad’s behalf, and I do not see
why it was deemed necesary to drag
ICU into the issue when our effect
will be minimal and the majority
of students are not in favour of it.
It is worth noting that the union
cannot legally spend any money on
the campaign either and seeing as
Sabbs are paid as soon as they give
any time to it we have spent money
on it. All in all, its a bit of a mess up
and I predict not a lot will happen
as a result.

Babar Ahmad has been accused of a
long list of terrorist activities includ-
ing: operating websites inciting and
funding terrorism and planning an
attack similar to that of US Cole in
the gulf. The list goes on.
If it is a question between Babar
Ahmad being released or impris-
oned without a trial pending extra-
dition, while it may seem unjust
he must be kept in prison. While
it has become all too trendy to be
highly cynical of our government’s
anti-terror campaign, at the end of
the day it boils down to a matter of
trust. Do you trust the government?
The world is not perfect, and at the
end of the day if the only way of
keeping us safe is for the govern-
ment to incarcerate a few terror-
ism suspects without trials / formal
charges, so be it. Surely the human
right for someone not be blown up is
greater than that of someone not to
be locked up.
While all the above to some extent
is debatable, the following is not:
The Union has no right to cam-
paign for his release. The union is
not elected under political grounds.
There is no way of checking whether
the council’s views are representa-
tive of the college in general.
Unlike tuition fees, where the
union could presume to have the
unanimous support of the college,
here they cannot. This is not spe-
cifically a student issue. The union
would not be acting democratically.
The union represents all of us. All
ofusdonotsupportthisissue.Unless
the union could prove through some
referendum that a sizable major-
ity backed this issue, or any other
political issue for that matter, it can-
not champion this cause.
It sounds to me like a weak willed
council bowed into intimidation...
TR
Please note that article 30 of the uni-
versal declaration of human rights
states that no human rights can be
used as an excuse to violate others.
The idea that the right to life comes
before the human rights of a suspect
hence stands in direct conflict with
the universal declaration of human
rights.
The reason why the declaration is
correct here, is in my mind, twofold:
- cruelty is never justified from a
moral perspective
- going against human rights
increases the risk of terrorism, as
the hearts and minds of muslim
communities here and eslewhere is
lost, and terror recruitment increas-
es. We are seeing this at this very
moment.
On the contrary, a more honour-
able and level-headed approach, i.e.
charging when there is evidence
and using surveillance whilst gath-
ering evidence, would better serve
to protect the citizens safety and
ideals.
We cannot judge the veracity of
the charges against Babar, but the
well-tried rule of law entails a due
legal process that can. Babar should
be either freed or charged in such a
process.
It is reasonable for the union to be
involved as Babar and, not unlikely,
other Imperial students/staff are
affected.
Hence I support this important
campaign, both for Babar and for
society as a whole.

CSFB reorganisation
Sir,
Numaan Chaudry journalsim
regarding the re-organiseation of
CSFB makes a mockery of Felix’s
attempt to offer business news.
Firstly, to suggest that prospective
interns should not consider the firm
indicates total lack of research into
the matter. CSFB remains a leading
player in the industry, indeed only
yesterday it was appointed advisor to
Telecom Italia Mobiles in the $27bn
dollar buyout of the remainning 44%
not held buy Telecom Italia. It may
interest him to know that Goldman
Sachs has been retained solely to
offer a “fairness opinion”. In terms
of layoffs, two to three hundred are
set to go, which from an organisa-
tion of 16,000+ is hardly a blood let-
ting, futhermore CSFB is still widely
hiring and paying in line with the
rest of the street, indeed total of 25
new investment banking analysts
were hired into the London office for
2004, with the number of new hires
for 2005 set to be 35.
I would argue that his lackadasical
approach to journalism has served
only to undermine the position of
one of the worlds leading securities
houses in one of the world leading
talent pools, which is disappoint-
ing, and hopefully not indicative of
the standards of the journalism that
Felix hopes to espouse.
Sincerely,
Charles Cassidy
Numaan Chaudhry, Business Editor,
replies:
Please tell me where I have under-
mined CSFB’s strength as a global
leader, its number one rankings
or indeed the strength of the above
divisions (equity research, securi-
ties origination).
Let me make it clear; I am well
aware of CSFB’s position and
growing prowess in many divi-
sions within investment banking.
Now I assume that because of your
affiliation with CSFB, whatever
that may be, you are a professional
and I was expecting you to voice
your opinions in a less extremist
fashion. Overloooking that, let me
now get to the crux of the issue.
The fact of the matter is, and no
doubt any linguistics expert will
support my view, that when I said
‘reconsider your options’, the con-
text in which this is said makes it
clear that students should reconsid-
er whether they should be applying
to these divisions; CSFB’s reputa-
tion has been left untainted.
I expect this clears up the con-
fusion and hope that you have
the courage to apologise for your
unjustified use of ‘mockery’ to Felix
volunteers.
Finally, in any future correspond-
ence, could I ask that you address
me properly by spelling my sur-
name correctly.
