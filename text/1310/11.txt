Nine months after I first went
undergroundwiththeImperial
College Caving Club (ICCC), I
unclipped from the rope at
the bottom of Concorde pitch,
deep within the mountain
Migovec in western Slovenia.
The white of the floor was
breathtaking,polishedsmooth
by the annual flow of snow
melt. I was perhaps the 20th
person to stand here and see
the colours, the shapes and
the sheer scale of this enor-
mous stone cathedral, every
last facet of it formed by water
and gravity.
Connecting me to the world
above, and leading ever deep-
er, were hundreds of lengths
of rope secured by literally
hammering into the rockface
– years of effort by students
from ICCC and the Slovenian
JSPDT.
I could just see the faint
orange light of my caving
buddy 70m above me. I built a
cairn of rocks as a substitute
for a tripod, and balanced my
old Soviet camera at an angle
I hoped would cover the whole
pitch. Dousing my light and
opening the shutter, I shouted
“rope free!”
I sat absolutely still (so as
not to to nudge the camera)
in the perfect darkness for
15 minutes and watched the
impossibly small orange dot
above me float down as gently
as a feather, with the lightning
blue flash burning an image
into my retina every minute
or two. I don’t think I’ve ever
felt quite so peaceful, quietly
biding my time sitting on a
shelf of rock surrounded by
moonscape.
After packing the camera
and eating some chocolate,
we readied for the ascent –
400m of rope to climb, nearly
five times the height of the
Queen’s Tower. Over eight
hours of solid climbing later, I
finally flopped out of the cave
and sniffed at the strange
ozone smell of the vegetation,
gazing up at the star-framed
silouttes of the mountains
across the valley.
My buddy, who had been
dilligently waiting at the bot-
tom of pitches as I climbed
in case I struck difficulty (not
once grumbling as he read
120 pages of his paperback
sitting in the cold), joined me
after a few short minutes. We
stumbled back to the Bivvi fol-
lowing the string as it snaked
around the many hazards on
the plateau. I was so utterly
exhausted that I had to be
helped out of my caving kit,
but was soon warmed by the
fire and refreshed with hot
chocolate and plates of chilli.
The photo came out and is
reproduced here (right) – a
snapshot to illustrate a sin-
gle day’s experiences while
on expedition with the cav-
ing club. There is no way to
squeeze the many activities
enjoyed during four weeks in
Slovenia into a single article,
but I hope that this tiny sliver
may kindle your interest.
About the Club
As enormously taxing as the
sport is, both physically and
psychologically, caving is
neither competitive nor
macho. The aim is to use
people’s different skills in
cooperation to further com-
mon goals of exploration and
enjoyment. No prior experi-
ence is required and all train-
ing is done within the club,
drawing on the experience
of our mature members. All
trips are tailored to the skills
and wishes of those taking
part, and you will never be
asked to do things that you
are unhappy with or that we
do not feel you are ready for
yet.
Imperial College Caving
Club runs regular weekend
trips to caving destinations
around the UK, usually cost-
ing £25 to £30 inclusive of all
training, equipment, trans-
poration, accomodation, food
and leadership. As well as
our summer expedition to
Slovenia, we have a week-long
tour during the Easter break
to somewhere warm and long
weekends to destinations
around Europe in the spring
and summer.
We meet weekly on
Tuesdays in Southside upper
lounge from 7.30pm and
practice rope-climbing in the
trees in Princes Gardens on
Wednesday afternoons from
1pm. Drop by at some point
for a chat and we’ll do our
best to answer any questions
that you have.

Thursday 24 February 2005
will mark the first meeting of
what is hoped will eventually
become the revived Imperial
College Railway Society
(ICRS).
I say ‘revived’ because it
seems that the ICRS never
officially died. It is not known
exactly why or when the soci-
ety disbanded, folded or just
faded away, but according to
the archives (predominant-
ly the surviving club tank-
ard), its last president was
‘inscribed’ in 1981.
A brief history of the
club
The earliest evidence of the
society so far discovered
dates from 1956. They had
their own magazine, Review,
their own constitution and
even their very own steam
locomotive named ‘Dymphna’
which was run on occasional
Sundays at a club track in
West London (the search con-
tinues to find this train, and if
anybody knows of its current
whereabouts, please contact
the author!)
Far from being a trainspot-
ters’ club (‘trainspotting’ then
a socially acceptable hobby
like any other, now almost
universally viewed as tan-
tamount to mental illness),
the society had a truly var-
ied social calendar for those
interested in railways. Events
included talks by eminent fig-
ures in the industry, site vis-
its, volunteer weekends and
main line excursions.
Revival
Two members of staff here at
Imperial College – Kim Winter
and John Barnes – rediscov-
ered the ICRS through their
links to the narrow-gauge
Ffestiniog Railway in North
Wales and decided to attempt
a revival. I met them through
almost pure luck, and togeth-
er we have now got the ball
rolling.
Members!
On Thursday 24 February
(6.45pm, room 342 Mechanical
Engineering), we invite YOU
– any interested person, stu-
dent, staff or alumnus – to
come and attend our first
meeting. Our guest speaker
will be Adrian Shooter, chair-
man of Chiltern Railways.
Amongst the post-privati-
sation train operating com-
panies (TOCs), Chiltern
Railways is a relatively ‘small
fish’ but has been highly suc-
cessful, both financially and
operationally. There can be
few people more qualified to
talk about ‘running a success-
ful railway company’. More
details will emerge nearer
the time, but it would be great
to get as much support as
possible. This is where our
appeal hinges.
Any club or society wish-
ing to be officially recognised
needs at least 20 people to
put their names to paper
(and preferably more). You
don’t have to book a place
at the lecture, but if you are
interested in attending and
becoming a member, I would
like to hear from you! Having
those all-important 20 sig-
natures also enables us to
obtain a small advertising
budget specifically to boost
the inception of this society.
If you are interested, please
email me as soon as possible
at david.horton@ic.ac.uk.
