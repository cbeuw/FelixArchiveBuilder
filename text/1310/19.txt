Imperial Women’s 1st 10
Wye Women’s 1st 20
By Suzanne Horn
This was the match Wye had
been waiting for: an Imperial
College head-to-head.
With two consecutive wins
under their belts, the Wye
girls were not going to be
defeated without a fight.
Aggression and team spirit
were soaring, and they
needed to be, facing the big
Virgin forwards.
The Wye girls were not
afraid by the Virgins’ Martin
Johnson quotes. Definitely
‘all talk and no action’, as
Wye’s tackling was in a dif-
ferent league. Our forwards
were outweighed and out-
sized, however the Wye pack
still managed to stand their
own ground and turn over a
few scrums.
The incredible lineouts
were not quite up to their
usual standard. In spite of
this, the pack redeemed
themselves with their awe-
some rucking and mauling.
By far the best of the season,
so far!
Hetts played superb
rugby throughout the entire
match, deservedly scoring
a try. The frightening tack-
ling and mauling strength of
the flanker, Pike, earned her
Wye’s player of the match
award.
The backs, as a whole, had
an amazing game. The sheer
speed and athleticism of the
back line was no match for
the slower, less powerful
Virgins.
Em had a cracking match,
side-stepping her way down
the pitch to score two great
tries. Lil and Death also have
to be mentioned for their fear-
less tackling. Kipling scored
a blinding try, set up from a
driving maul powered by the
whole pack. This try was defi-
nitely a brilliant team effort,
certainly one to be proud of.
Wye left a lasting impres-
sion on the Virgins, literally!
This was Wye’s first league
away win, and with a per-
formance like that, it will ulti-
mately not be the last.
Wye face Kings in the next
match in the league. Let’s
hope they won’t take away
our crown.

Wye triumph in Imperial head-to-head
