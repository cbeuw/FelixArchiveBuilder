At 1am on Boxing Day, an
earthquake in the Indian
Ocean sparked off the
most dangerous tsunami for
decades.
As the wave rolled on
towards the shores of
Indonesia, India and Sri
Lanka, it became clear that
this was a serious disaster.
In the hours and days that
followed, we realised it was
possibly the worst ever, the
wave so powerful that it even
hit the shores of Africa.
As Felix goes to press,
the death toll has officially
reached 140,000 and the
number of people left home-
less has grown to five million.
The aid that has been so gen-
erously donated is only just
reaching the survivors, as
the infrastructure for deliv-
ery has been washed away.
The lack of clean water and
sanitation mean that cholera
and typhoid are serious risks,
which could further increase
the number of dead.
Dramatic scenes have
been witnessed on televi-
sion screens throughout the
world, as people in the affect-
ed regions struggle for sur-
vival and scramble for food
supplies.
After teasing ourselves with
disaster movies for years, we
were finally faced with the
real thing and realised the
full horror. No-one could out-
run this wave or save their
sweetheart, there was no dra-
matic music, and the leaders
of the world did not all rally
round immediately. Science
did not win the day, and there
was no early warning system
to limit the number of victims.
The wave just quietly rolled
on and on, sweeping up eve-
rything in its path.
Jack Straw, the Foreign
Secretary, said that 199
Britons are “highly likely” to
have died in the disaster. Mr
Straw added that “many of
the bodies of the dead may
never be found”. Kofi Annan,
the United Nations Secretary
General, said that affected
areas could take up to ten
years to recover.
Imperial College students
and their families may well
have been affected by the
tsunami, as the College has
significant numbers of stu-
dents from several of the
affected countries, includ-
ing Sri Lanka, India and
Thailand. However, with tens
of thousands of people still
missing and the spring term
only just begun, it is impos-
sible to judge the disaster’s
impact on the Imperial popu-
lation at this stage.
The tsunami was caused
by the biggest earthquake
for 40 years, which occurred
between the Australian and
Eurasian plates of the Earth’s
crust. A series of huge waves
then spread across a large
portion of the Indian Ocean.
The worst affected countries
were Indonesia – with over
94,000 confirmed dead – and
Sri Lanka.

Indian Ocean struck by one of
world’s worst natural disasters
Two of the many scenes of devastation caused by the
recent Indian Ocean tsunami
By Tom Simonite
Science writer
The human cost of the
submarine earthquake on
Boxing Day is still being
counted. No-one was
expecting the quake or the
subsequent wall of water,
but thousands of lives could
have been saved if an early
warning system had been
in place.
While earthquakes are
impossible to predict, it is
possible to implement sys-
tems that provide imme-
diate information on their
severity and an advance
warning of tsunamis.
There are two key com-
ponents to such systems:
instruments to monitor
quakes and tsunamis, along
with a framework able to
communicate the necessary
warnings to the local gov-
ernments of those at risk.
The Indian Ocean lacks
both.
Richer nations around the
Pacific Basin do have such a
system – 26 member states
belong to the Tsunami
Warning System (TWS).
Seismological and tidal sta-
tions throughout the Pacific
provide data on quakes with
the potential to cause tsu-
namis, and any that are pro-
duced. The Pacific Tsunami
Warning Center (PTWC)
near Honolulu, Hawaii, pro-
vides tsunami warnings to
national authorities in the
Pacific Basin.
Criteria of location and
magnitude of an earthquake
are used to predict whether
a tsunami is likely. A warn-
ing is issued in the form of
predicted arrival times of
the wave at selected coast-
al communities within the
geographic area defined by
the maximum distance the
tsunami could travel in a
few hours. Less specific
warnings and timings are
issued for an area defined
by the distance the tsunami
could travel in a subsequent
time period. If equipment
monitoring sea levels actu-
ally detects a tsunami wave
then a wider warning is
issued to the entire Pacific
Basin.
Issuing the necessary
information to national
authorities is only the begin-
ning of a successful warn-
ing. Governments need to
be able to coordinate the
evacuation of people at risk
quickly. Members of the
TWS, particularly richer
nations, have managed to
do this. Pacific states of the
US have tsunami sirens in
place to warn the public.
Japan has been able to rap-
idly and effectively evacu-
ate populations at risk in
response to warnings issued
by the PTWC.
The non-existence of simi-
lar systems in the Indian
Ocean has not been a secret.
UN-approved plans to place
new monitoring equipment
in the Indian Ocean have
faltered due to a delay in
the necessary funding, and
the poverty of the nations in
the region. A lack of politi-
cal harmony between these
countries has also been
cited as hampering the
inception of a warning sys-
tem that could have saved
many lives.
Now, in the wake of the
still-unfolding tragedy, lead-
ers of the affected countries
and from the wider interna-
tional community are com-
mitting to ensuring that an
early warning system is cre-
ated for the Indian Ocean.
Sadly, it will be too late for
the tens of thousands of
victims of the Boxing Day
disaster.
Early warning
system could
have saved lives
By Emily Gwyer
In the aftermath of the worst
humanitarian distaster in
recent times, what can be
done to help those affected
and prevent similar occur-
rences in the future?
Well, many of us have
already done it – donate
money at www.dec.org.uk or
at a collection box. We can
send clothes and household
things to Oxfam, who will
deliver them to people who
have lost everything.
We can rail against George
Bush and Tony Blair, who
do not see the worst disas-
ter for centuries to be reason
enough to interrupt their holi-
days. Indeed, this has already
beguninAmerica,wherethere
was outcry over the original
offering, which was half the
amount the Republicans plan
to spend on Bush’s inaugu-
ration. The amount donated
by the British public shamed
our government after Tony
Blair’s pathetic original offer-
ing of £1m was donated every
hour by the public.
We can demand that the
money promised by the world
actually gets there – aid agen-
cies warned this week that
western governments have
an unfortunate habit of prom-
ising millions and then forget-
ting to deliver them.
We can push for early warn-
ing systems to be put in place
all around the world. If such
a system had been in place in
Indonesia, the vast majority
of lives lost would have been
saved – the wave took an hour
and a half to reach land. And
although 80% of tsunamis
occur in the Pacific Ocean,
we should not be complacent
– we need to set up a system
too. Just in case. Being over-
cautious doesn’t seem so bad
now, does it?
We can carry on visiting the
affected countries, which will
need our money more than
ever in the next few years.
We can pray for the survi-
vors and the families of the
dead, and hope that nothing
like this ever happens again.
What can we do now?

RAG Chair
In response to the world-
wide appeal, many clubs and
societies as well as individu-
als at Imperial have mobi-
lised to raise funds and offer
assistance to the victims of
the tsunami.
RAG and City and Guilds
have combined resources to
co-ordinate activities across
the campus, so that clubs and
societies can concentrate on
collecting money. RAG will
provide collecting tins and
count the cash as it comes in.
Clubs and societies and
individuals interested in help-
ing are invited to contact
rag@ic.ac.uk or go to the City
and Guilds office (room 340,
mechanical engineering).
Anyone wanting to collect
should also head to the office,
where collecting tins will be
issued.
RAG aims to help people
to organise their own events,
using our experience to
remove the paperwork bur-
den and offer advice.
The RAG website (see
address below) has been
updated to provide up-to-the-
minute news regarding the
collection and to list events
that are being carried out.
Anyone planning an event is
welcome to use this space to
publicity, by emailing a sum-
mary to rag@ic.ac.uk. You
can also follow the link from
the main Union web page.
Please help the appeal
by giving your time or your
money to the collectors you
will see around College. You
can also make donations by
visiting the City and Guilds
office.
