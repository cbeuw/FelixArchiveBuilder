Six months to go...
Happy new year! I don’t have any
particular message this week, so I’ll
run through my top ten priorities
(as they came out of my head) for
my remaining six months in office
(and this term in particular).
Postgraduates
The Union lacks a properly ground-
ed postgraduate representation
structure. To some extent, the
Postgraduate Society provides a
social forum but the Union really
needs to establish a Postgraduate
Association akin to the Faculty
Unions. I hope to have this in place
before I leave.
QAA Institutional Audit
Thank you so much for participat-
ing in the Union’s online student
survey last term. We achieved a
good response. This will be the sin-
gle most important opportunity to
improve the student experience at
Imperial for the next five years (see
Sam’s update below).
Strategic Review and Union
plan
Sameena has written an update
(below) on the Strategic Review
process. It’s now really important
that we use all the information
gained to agree and develop a busi-
ness for the Union for the next
College planning cycle.
Casual payroll
Several hundred students work on
a casual basis in various College
departments (catering, confer-
ences, ICT, etc) as well as at the
Union. They used to be paid weekly,
however last term they were moved
on to a monthly pay system. Along
with implementation problems, this
has caused significant hardship
for many of the most financially-
pressed students at the College. I
hope to have this resolved within
a month.
Union governance
There are various parts of the
Union’s governance that are ‘bro-
ken’. Lack of support of postgradu-
ates is one area. The structure of
the Life Sciences Faculty Union is
another. However the biggest prob-
lem is that the Union is over-gov-
erned. There are too many rules
that are never enforced (and impos-
sible to do), especially for clubs
and societies, and too many layers
of decision-making that hinder, not
help, the democratic process.
Asian tsunami
Inevitably there will be many
students who have been affected,
and many more who will want to
help in some way. The RAG Chair
has written a piece (see page 2)
on some of the fundraising activi-
ties that are going on around the
Union. I expect much more to
happen over the coming weeks –
especially when we start getting
confirmed information on how
many Imperial students have been
directly affected.
Beit Masterplan
Contrary to what some Council
members thought, there is no
‘Masterplan’ (yet) and students
were always going to be consulted.
That will now happen, as per the
original timetable (ie after the stra-
tegic plan is finalised) and will be an
exciting opportunity to look at how
we can make best use of the Union
building in Beit Quad.
Southside
The College needs help from stu-
dents (who are registered vot-
ers in Westminster) to write in to
Westminster Council in support of
the College’s planning application
to demolish Southside and build
new halls of residence. There is
a serious chance that the Council
may block the application to keep
local residents happy. Expect an
email from me this week...
Rees Commission – Top-up
fees in Wales
The Union will be sending a submis-
sion to the Rees Commission which
is looking at the possible implemen-
tation of top-up fees in Wales. This
impacts Imperial students because
the situation in England will be
reviewed in 2009. If, by that time,
the Welsh Assembly Government
has developed a successful alterna-
tive funding model then that could
well be replicated here.
Babar Ahmad
Union Council passed a motion
requiring the Union to campaign for
the release of Babar Ahmad. I hope
we can use this opportunity to look
at some broader issues affecting
Imperial students that I have hinted
at in previous columns.

The joy of... quality assurance
Quality assurance is one of those
pieces of jargon that seems to crop
up more and more these days.
If you’ve ever worked in indus-
try, you are almost certain to have
heard it used, but you may not nec-
essarily see the point of it. Quality
assurance (QA) is a programme
for the systematic monitoring and
evaluation of a service to ensure
that standards of quality are being
met.
But why am I boring you with
this? Well, Imperial College takes it
seriously and goes to great lengths
to ensure student involvement in
its QA process. That amounts to me
spending a considerable amount of
my working day fulfilling a quality
assurance role.
One example of this is the rep-
resentation network that I co-ordi-
nate. Year reps speak to their class,
ascertain any problems that stu-
dents are having with a particular
course, lecturer or facility, and have
a quiet word in the ear of the course
director. If the problem cannot be
solved there and then, it may be
necessary to involve the depart-
mental rep, and possibly raise
the issue in a forum such as the
staff-student committee. If the
problem is of a general nature, pos-
sibly affecting students in other
departments, it may be brought to
my attention either at a meeting,
or by email. I spend much of my
time sitting on College-level com-
mittees whose whole purpose is
quality assurance, and I give this
feedback to those who can imple-
ment change.
Another example of quality
assurance is the Student On-Line
Evaluation (SOLE), which the
College conducts every term to
monitor student satisfaction with
undergraduate courses and lec-
turers. Thanks to the 50% of you
who took the time to complete this
valuable exercise. Your department
or your representatives should let
you know the results of the survey
shortly. If they don’t, chase them up,
because it’s important!
Quality assurance is particularly
pertinent at the moment, because
the College is undergoing an
institutional audit by the Quality
Assurance Agency (QAA), an inde-
pendent body set up to safeguard
the public interest in sound aca-
demic standards. This is done by
carrying out reviews of standards
and quality in higher education
institutions.
In order to gain student input into
the process, the QAA has asked the
Union to submit a “student written
statement”, representative of the
views of the student body, concern-
ing their educational experience.
This has been compiled, based on
the responses to the recent ques-
tionnaire, and students’ opinions
gleaned from focus groups, in addi-
tion to concerns fed through by the
representative system. A draft has
been written, and is available at
www.union.ic.ac.uk/qaa. This is not
the finished article, as it will still
go through the relevant commit-
tees, on which your representatives
sit, and eventually to the Union
Council. However, if you are keen
to comment on the document,
or on any other matter, please
get in touch with me directly at
dpew@ic.ac.uk.

Remember that online survey?
Well thank you to all those who
took part. It was the first time we
had done such a project on such a
scale, and we had a great response
– around 3,500 students taking part.
We also had a good response to the
questionnaire completed by clubs
and society officers. Your responses
will be central to the way the Union
develops over the next few years.
The winners of the Playstation
and other prizes have not been
drawn yet, but this will happen in
the coming week and the results will
be published.
After the online surveys were
closed, the process of analysing the
data and preparing the statistics
began, as did the focus groups, which
were the second stage of informa-
tion gathering – small groups of dif-
ferent cross sections of the student
body. These were brainstorming and
discussion sessions (on the issues
covered in the survey), a method
often used in industry. Thank you to
those who took part, especially so
close to the end of term!
Using the information from the
survey and focus groups, a strate-
gic plan for the Union will be sub-
mitted to the College’s planning
round, where we will bid for greater
investment in the Union building
and activities. The strategic plan
will also be the starting point for
the Union’s budget and plans for the
next few years.
In addition, the information will
be used to form the brief given to
architects for a design for the Union
building. Next week, a decision as to
which of three competing architects
will be used is being made by the
Union executive committee, based
on the firms’ ability to design appro-
priately for a students’ union of our
nature.
From the surveys we will also be
looking at the feedback we have
got and what ideas were put for-
ward. We will use this information
to improve areas of the Union that
were reviewed. We will be looking
through all the results of the survey
and comments that were made, and
we will use these to improve the
Union to better serve you. With so
many participants, we have a lot of
valuable information from students,
which we want to use to improve
the Union.

Review can be found at www.union.
