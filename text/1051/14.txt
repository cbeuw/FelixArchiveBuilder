Eric Rohmer's Rendez-Vous in Paris is a compila-
tion of three discrete stories set in different areas
of Paris and all dealing with meeting or rendez-
vous. The first segment entitled 'Rendez-Vous at
Seven O'clock' concerns Esther who suspects
her boyfriend is being unfaithful. In retribution
she arranges to meet up with a stranger whom
she met at the market, in a cafe her boyfriend is
said to frequent. She has her wallet stolen but is
coincidentally returned to her by the woman
who is meeting her boyfriend at the same cafe.
Together they go to their respective rendez-vous'
at the same cafe.
The second segment, entitled 'Park
Benches', details a series of meetings between a
young woman intent on leaving her fiance, and
her boyfriend, a young professor, intent on mov-
ing from the suburbs into the city. All the meet-
ings take place in the various parks scattered
throughout Paris. The third segment, entitled
'Mother and Child, 1907', tells of a chance
encounter between a painter and a young
woman. The painter becomes instantly infatuat-
ed with this young woman, whilst escorting a
Swedish friend to the Picasso museum.
Not a great deal happens in the film, with
only the first segment having any narrative direc-
tion. Consequently, the majority of the film con-
sists mainly of just a few characters doing noth-
ing but wandering around and talking. Not that
this makes a bad film - some of the best Woody
Allen films are little more than this - but Allen's
dialogue is entertaining and the characters are
interesting. By contrast Eric Rohmer's dialogue is
boring and simply breeds apathy for his charac-
ters. The first segment is quite diverting but
unfortunately is also the shortest. From then on
the film steadily goes down hill.
It is not just the script which is to blame.
Eric Rohmer has done himself no favours with
his choice of film locations and methods. One
would imagine that any film maker shooting in
Paris would want to make good use of the Paris
architecture and sites. By choosing to shoot the
film as a sort of nowhere town Rohmer seems to
be defeating halfthe point of his film. It is, after
all, supposed to be about rendez-vous in Paris ,
rather than any other European town. Paris
implies a degree of mythicism and romanticism
which Rohmer manages to totally obliterate with
shots of building works. The film might have
redeemed itself somewhat if it was at least sceni-
cally shot. However, by using no fancy cine-
matography Rohmer has ruled out that option as
well. In fact at times the camera work is so poor
as to be distracting and annoying. The actors
cope with their material but none of them act
with any real indication of emotion.
KendezVous in Paris doesn't pretend to be
anything fancy but it can't be described as a
entertaining small film.
