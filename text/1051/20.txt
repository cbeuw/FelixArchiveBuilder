Exploration Day
On the 29th of February IC ExploSoc will be
holding Explo Day. It will consist of two lec-
tures on different aspects of exploration.
Firstly the IC expedition, Hunza 1995
will be giving their account of their expedi-
tion to Pakistan. They went to study the
effects of the Karokoram highway (the high-
est in the world) on the Hunza people. In
addition to being highly entertaining it
should prove to all you budding expedition-
ers just what you can achieve whilst at IC. It
will take place at 12.15pm in the Clore lec-
ture theatre.
Nick Lewis will give a lecture in the
evening entitled 'Bootless on the
Hummingbird'. Nick, an environmental con-
sultant based in Windsor, will talk about his
'entertaining' trip to Canada and Alaska. The
Hummingbird ridge on Mount Logan is one
the longest and hardest in North America
with a reputation for being irreversible and
certainly not the place to drop a boot. After
his companion did just that they had a seri-
ous discussion before descending both alive
and unscathed. Since they could not be
flown out they had to ski out 100 miles
through the Yakon to safety. This will take
place at 6pm in the Pippard lecture theatre.
Members of ExploSoc will be available
at both events to answer questions about the
Society.
