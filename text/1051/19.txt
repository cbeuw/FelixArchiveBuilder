Bar Extensions
ICU obtains its Friday night bar exten-
sions through what is called a "Special
Orders Exemption" from the Police
Licensing Officer. Usually our applications
are granted with an extension until lam,
however for reasons totally beyond our con-
trol, the next three Friday nights have only
been granted bar extensions until 12.30am or
midnight: we will be keeping the disco open
until 2am. At present, we cannot appeal
against these decisions, but we are hoping to
begin moves toward a permanent license,
which would prevent this situation re-occur-
ring in the future. We apologise for the effect
this may have on your Friday nights, but we
hope it won't stop you having a great night
out, 'cos we'll keep on bringing you the best
ents ever...

Chinese Society
The Chinese Society Variety Show was held
on 16th and 17th February, offering an
opportunity for the members of the Chinese
Society to throw away their lecture notes
and tutorial sheets for a 'couple of hours' and
take up the task of acting, directing or back-
staging a live show.
With a production as big as the V-show,
problems where unavoidable. In the week
before the production, the 'problem index'
had reached its upper limit: Overestimated
sponsorship (due to V A T ) , management
problems, performers withdrawn due to ill-
ness... Despite these problems, as the chair-
lady put it, 'the show must go on'.
On Friday evening the show performed
to a friendly audience. As one of the produc-
tion crew put it 'The show was not perfect,
but it wasn't bad at all.'
On Saturday the curtain went up to a
larger audience and crowd control became a
problem. There were difficulties at the
entrance, but when the music started, the
only sounds were fun and laughter. The show
finally ended with a Cantonese song called
'Strong' which summed up the feeling of
those involved.
During the organisation of the V-show,
the name of Ka Wai Lee, the chairlady,
stands out. Her effort and enthusiasm were,
and still are, greatly appreciated by all those
involved.
Happy [Chinese] New Year, and all the
best in the year of the Mouse.
'No Problem! No Problem!' said Tim,
although 'problem index' had reached its
highest limit.

...if they continue to succeed in gain-
ing votes by force-feeding the elec-
torate with their Utopian manifesto.
However, anyone examining the
shiny exterior of 'New Labour' will
notice cracks, revealing superficial,
ill-considered, and impractical poli-
cies. Forget Labour. Instead consid-
er yourself invited to listen to the
sound political views of the
Conservative MP's and ministers
who have put the Great back into
Britain after years of socialist-led
decline.
