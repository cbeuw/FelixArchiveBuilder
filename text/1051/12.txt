album: the bluetones
expecting to fly
The Bluetones were first heard by the general
public in 1994 with their highly sought after
Fierce Panda e.p., 'Return To Splendour'. With
the publicity from this release they were support-
ing the likes of Shed Seven and Supergrass by the
end of 1994. Now, with the re-release of 'Slight
Return', which went straight into the charts at
No.2, they are headlining their own sold out tour
and are releasing their eagerly anticipated debut
album.
The album begins with an aeroplane flying
over The Bluetones' home in Hounslow, a town
which is now firmly on the musical map. The C D
version of the album is divided into two halves just
like a traditional record, with a bit of hiss and sta-
tic in between. It contains the two most recent
singles, 'Bluetonic' and 'Slight Return', with their
unashamedly jangly guitars, as well as live
favourites and new material.
One of the stand-out tracks is A Parting
Gesture', a laid-back, blues-tinged outing.
Another highlight is 'Putting Out Fires' where
lead singer Mark reminisces about a past relation-
ship. On the theme of relationships, "The
Fountainhead' is a more personal song which talks
about Mark's grandfather.
The Bluetones have decided not to follow
the current Britpop scene and have produced an
album with individuality and a genuine sense ol
honesty. They obviously didn't feel that they had
to outdo the rest of the crowd because they are
rightly confident that their music stands up along-
side the best. (9)

album: gin blossoms - ~
~
congratulations, i'm sorry*
Regular readers of this page may have noticed that
in recent weeks I have been singing the praises oi
a great many bands. I just hope that this deluge oi
masterful albums continues for the rest of the
year. A tad unrealistic you might say but given this
new album by the Gin Blossoms and the fact that
there are a few more positive reviews to come in
the next few weeks, you never know - a great
album a week might just be the case.
So, what makes this album so good? Well, if
you've heard the new single, 'Til I Hear It From
You', you should know already. Robin Wilson's lilt-
ing voice, Scott Johnson and Jesse Valenzuela's
slightly understated guitars and a gentle, nagging-
ly persuasive chorus all add up to a tune that you
can't say no to. Elsewhere, the likes of As Long It
Matters' repeat the trick but place even more
emphasis on Wilson's textured voice.
Not that the Gin Blossoms get by on just
being mellow. Far from it. Opener Day Job', for
example, is a bit of a rock-out with heavy percus-
sion and tasteful guitar histrionics. Given their
past, wondrous outings such as 'Hey Jealousy',
this should not come as much of a surprise and
merely points to the band's versatility within the
middle-class American musical framework that
they operate inside.
And so, there you have it. Another album
overflowing with songs that get better every time
you hear them. Roll on next week... (8)
