CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING
Some of you may have seen
the governments television
advertising campaign on the
dangers of carbon monoxide
poisoning. This subject has
been raised in previous
newsletters and is also dealt
with in the Union Housing
Rights Guide (available from
the Union reception or the
accomodation office). As we
are still in the grip of winter, it
is worth raising the matter
again. Carbon monoxide
poisoning is often caused by
older gas appliances
particularly where there is no
vent on an outside wall which
ensures that waste products
do not build up inside the
room.Landlords are now
legally responsible for ensur-
ing that any gas appliances
are safety checked once a
year. Danger signs include:
l.Soot stains or discolouring
on a gas fire or at the top of a
water heater
2. A yellow or orange flame
3. A strange smell when a gas
appliance is on.
If you are in any doubts
regarding the safety of any
appliances then you should
approach your landlord to get
them serviced. If he refuses to
do this, contact your local
environmental health officer
or phone the gas safety action
line on 0800 300 363.
Every year 30 to 40 people
die from the use of faulty
appliances. Sadly, students
living in "low cost" private
rented accomodation are
often included amongst the
victims.

The Small Claims limit has
been increased from £1000 to
£3000 from January 1996.
This is good news for anyone
who finds themselves needing
to take action to recover
monies from rogue sellers or
suppliers of faulty services as
often, the amounts involved
might have previously
exceeded the old limit.
Taking a case to the small
claims court is extremely
straightforward and relatively
expensive (costing lOp per £1
claimed or less for larger
sums). Another benefit to the
plaintiff is that solicitors costs
cannot be claimed by either
side (although you can claim
the costs of issuing the sum-
mons). The process involves
writing a letter to the other
party setting out the details of
your claim, issuing a sum-
mons and then waiting for the
defendant to respond. If the
case is contested then it is
resolved in an arbitration
hearing by a district judges
private chambers. The hear-
ing is fairly informal (i.e.
there is no jury or courtroom
drama!). Many cases are set-
tled before this stage. Often
the sight of a summons will
be enough to prompt the
defendant into accepting his
responsibilities.
Naturally, your chances of
success depend upon you
being able to prove your case
"on the balance of probabili-
ties". However, if the person
you are suing does not have
the means to pay then you
may still be unable to recover
your money.
Leaflets
The Lord Chancellor's
Department has produced an
excellent set of leaflets which
are available from the Union
Reception area. Anyone who
feels that they might have a
case would be advised to con-
tact either Trading Standards,
a law centre or the Union
Advice Office for initial
assistance.
