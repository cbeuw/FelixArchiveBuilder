N e w regulations
affecting A s y l u m
seekers
From February 5th 1996, the
government have implement-
ed changes to regulations
concerning entitlements of
asylum seekers to social secu-
rity benefits.
Three main groups of people
will be affected;
1. Asylum-seekers who have
been found by the immigra-
tion authorities not to be
refugees (and those who
appeal against this decision
will not receive benefits while
waiting for it to be heard)
2. Asylum seekers and other
people from abroad who
entered the country on the
understanding that they
would not be a burden on
public funds and who could
support themselves, or who
have entered the country ille-
gally
3. Sponsored immigrants who
were allowed into the country
on the condition that they
would not be a burden on
public funds
In other words, a person
entering the country under a
status such as "student" or
"visitor" subject to the rele-
vant entry conditions cannot,
having gained entry to the
country, then later claim asy-
lum and expect to receive
benefits.
Student Asylum Seekers
Student asylum seekers
would fall into the second cat-
egory although even before
these changes, no full time
students were able to claim

Overseas students who would
like to spend some time living
with a British family in
almost any part of the United
Kingdom are able to do so
thanks to the HOST scheme.
It arranges visits to participat-
ing British households creat-
ing an excellent opportunity
to combine a holiday with a
genuine cultural exchange.
Afl you will be expected to
pay is the cost of your travel
to your destination so if you
are interested about finding
out more, further details and
application forms are avail-
able from the Advice Office.
You can apply on your own or
with a friend. Applications
are currently being processed
for most weekends up to the
May Bank Holiday (25-27th).
Care is taken to place students
with suitable hosts, for exam-
ple a lone female student
would only be placed with
either a single female or mar-
ried couple and other details
including religion (and diet),
preference for pets and smok-
ing are also taken into
consideration.
income support or housing
benefit unless they met spe-
cific entitlement conditions
(relating to disability or fami-
ly circumstances for exam-
ple). However, a student who
becomes afraid to return to
his/her home country whilst
studying due to changes in
that country could previously
have applied for benefits if
for example, he or she were
forced to leave the course or
to switch to part-time study
while the application was
being considered.
The government has said that
in circumstances where
"some (people) would be
trapped in the UK because of
a major change of circum-
stances in their home country
prevents their return after
having arrived here" then the
applicant will be able to claim
benefits. These countries
would be regarded as
"Upheaval countries". To
date, no upheaval countries
have been declared.
The new regulations have
been opposed by all organisa-
tions which assist immigrants
and asylum-seekers. Research
by the Refugee Council has
shown that 80% of the
claimants they had assisted
who did not apply immediate-
ly at the port of entry had
applied within their first
week of arrival. They argue
that many asylum-seekers
arrive traumatised by recent
experiences and are afraid to
apply for asylum immediately
until they can seek advice.
They also fear that they will
be made to return if they
apply before they have
entered the country.
Imperial College has a full
time disabilities officer who
can help and advise students
with seen or unseen disabili-
ties. Loretto CTCallaghan is
based in the Sherfield
Building, Room 324 and can
be contacted on (internal)
48935.
Dyslexia
Unseen disabilities include
dyslexia which is often
hidden by students who are
afraid that they will be
discriminated against in some
way if they make their situa-
tion known. As coursework
becomes more complicated it
can cause increasing
difficulties, especially if the
condition is not acknowl-
edged by staff.
Anyone facing any sort of
difficulties due to a disability
of any kind (including tempo-
rary problems caused by acci-
dent or injury) can speak to
her in absolute confidence.
