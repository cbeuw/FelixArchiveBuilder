Anorexia and bulimia nervosa
are not primarily about food;
starving or binge eating are
symptoms of underlying emo-
tional and psychological dis-
tress.
A N O R E X I A
Anorexia is most commonly
found amongst people aged
15-25 and it can often lead to
bulimia nervosa, which is by
far the most common of the
two conditions. About 90% of
sufferers are women.
Research has shown that
about 2% of young women
and 0.2% of young men are
affected. Over 10% of suffer-
ers die from either the effects
of the starvation or from sui-
cide.
The main sympton of anorex-
ia nervosa is the relentless
pursuit of thinness through
self starvation and a fear of
being fat.
Other symptons include;
1. Severe weight loss
2. Distortions and misconcep-
tions about weight and body
size
3. Excessive exercising
4. vomiting/purging
5. emotional irritable behav-
iour
6. difficulty in sleeping
7. loss of menstrual periods
8. perfectionism
9. feeling cold, poor circula-
tion
10. growth of downy hair
over body.
B U L I M I A
Bulimia Nervosa is charac-
terised by binge eating fol-
lowed by self-induced vomit-
ing, periods of starvation
and/or purging with laxatives.
Other symptoms include;
1. Binge eating large amounts
of food
2. Vomiting and/or purging
3. Often disappearing to the
lavatory after meals to get rid
of food eaten.
4. Secretive behaviour
5. Feeling out of control,
helpless and lonely
6. Menstrual disturbance
7. Sore throat and erosion of
tooth enamel caused by vom-
iting
8. Dehydration, poor skin
condition
9. Emotional behaviour and
mood swings
10. Devious and deceptive
behaviour
Treatments can take many
forms and generally must be
tailored to the particular
patient. They include coun-
selling, psychotherapy, cogni-
tive behaviour therapy, group
therapy, dietetic advice, day
hospital treatment and some-
times drugs in the short term.
Re-feeding must be carried
out but the treatment must
tackle the psychological
aspects in order for the treat-
ment to succeed in the long
term.
The sooner an eating disorder
is recognised and treated, the
better the prognosis. People
with eating disorders are
often afraid of asking for help
because they fear that they
will not be understood, or that
they will be treated unsympa-
thetically. Since the causes of
eating disorders are complex
and will be different for each
person affected, it is impor-
tant to seek help from people
who understand the condi-
tions.
General Practitioners may
vary in their experience and
understanding of these condi-
tions but for many, a GP will
be the first person they seek
help from.Altematively, there
arespecialist voluntary groups
who can provide support and
advice in complete confi-
dence.
One such voluntary organisa-
tion is The Eating disorders
Association which offers a
range of services. It has two
telephone helplines.
On 01603 621414 callers can
talk in confidence to someone
who understands the prob-
lems of anorexia and bulimia
(9.00am-6.30pm Mon-Fri).
Alternatively a recorded mes-
sage can be heard on 0891
615 466 (but this is a premi-
um line with high charges).
Finally, students can join the
association for a discounted
rate of £7.50 per year (full
rate £20.00).
For this you receive informa-
tion on hospital and self-help
treatment, details of your
nearest self-help group, a bi-
monthly newsletter and other
information.
