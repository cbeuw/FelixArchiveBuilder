Biomedical plans
stalled once more
BY TIM ST.CLAIR
Approval of the application to
demolish the RCS II building to
make way for the proposed Basic
Medical Sciences block has been
postponed once more. The appli-
cation, which should have been
put before the borough council
planning meeting this week, has
been put off until March 7th so
that English Heritage may pre-
sent their views to the meeting.
English Heritage's involve-
ment in the application plans is a
consequence of the listed status
of the RCS II building. Their
officer responsible for the pre-
sentation was unavailable lor
comment. In her absence,
F.nglish Heritage staff were
reluctant to give details of the
organisation's intentions.
This is the third time that
the application has failed to be
considered by the planning meet-
ing, and the time allowed for
possible delays which the build-
ing schedule incorporated has
now decreased to a matter of
weeks. Ian Caldwell, Director of
Estates, did not seem worried
about this latest setback, com-
menting that there was still time
in hand. He admitted to being
'somewhat concerned' when the
planning authorities last delayed
the proposals (Felix 1047).
The constituent medical
school Unions are still worried
that the plans do not make ade-
quate provision for social space
within the BMS building itself. A
joint letter from the St Mary's
and Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School
Union presidents, written in
response to an open letter from
the Rector, queried the funding
available for student facilities.
Whilst accepting that social facil-
ties at their current campuses
could not be fully duplicated
within the new premises, they
insisted that adequate provision
must be made for medical stu-
dents needs.
Sarah White, president of
ICU, remarked that she knew
nothing of the letter, and "didn't
know what they were trying to
achieve" by not telling her, insist-
ing that the medical school pres-
idents had said they were writing
the piece for London Student.
P H O T O : ALEX FEAKES
A disguised Duke of Vienna (John Barnes) and Barnadine (Omar
Islam) of St Mary's Hospital Medical School Drama Society per-
formed William Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure at ICU
this week. The two night run of the play on the South Kensington
Campus marks a first for St Mary's Dramsoc and hopes are high
that it will encourage future cooperation between drama societies.
Director Jim Coward's intention to move the play into a seven-
ties setting gave a new feel to the play, one that is traditionally dif-
ficult to discern as a tragedy or a comedy. Tuesday night saw a small
but appreciative audience witness an impressive performance by the
cast. A full house on Wednesday evening relieved growing concerns
that Imperial College students were allergic to cultural stimulation.
Disc-jockey thieves
Disco equipment stolen from
the Union last week is thought
to have remained in Beit Quad
for a few days before being
removed, sparking suggestions of
student involvement. page 3
Capital funding cuts
ICU face a 28% capital funding
cut in their equipment grant
from College. There have been
complaints that the budgets
have already been "cut to the
bone." page 2
End to late bars
Late licences to lam on Friday
nights could soon be a thing of
the past as fewer extensions are
granted. The bar will still be
open until midnight, and ents
will not be affected. page 2
