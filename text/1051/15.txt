Las Vegas, 1973: a city of glitter and dreams, a
stage for billionaires, politicians and glamourous
showgirls. It just wasn't ready for the arrival of
Sam Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and
Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).
Ace, the con-
summate bookie
who could change
the odds just by plac-
ing a bet has been
picked by the mob to
front their entrance
into Vegas where he
quickly doubles the
mobs takings. With
Ace providing the
brains and Nicky pro-
viding the muscle
everything seems to
be going well until
Ginger McKenna
(Sharon Stone), a
chip-hustling vamp,
Charms Ace and
becomes his wife.
Greed soon overcomes them all and leads
to their eventual destruction, but not before they
bring down everyone else with them.
This movie sees the return of the Goodfella
team with Martin Scorcese directing and co-
writing the screenplay with Nicholas Pileggi and
De Niro and Pesci in front of the camera. The
chemistry between De Niro and Pesci is very
strong and Scorcese's attention to detail is amaz-
ing, proving that it really is better to work with
people you know well.
The film itself is straight to the point with
plenty of expletives and some horrifying
moments of violence including a very unusual
application of a vice.
These moments are
alleviated by some
genuinely funny
scenes which spring
up throughout the
movie.
However, Casino's
real strength lies in
the cast. De Niro
and Pesci tell the
story in a semi-narra-
tive which although
annoying at first
actually paces the
move very well. De
Niro gives a charac-
teristically strong
performance and
Sharon Stone proves
that she really can act. As for Pesci, well he steals
the show, his mere presence brings the screen
alive.
The only gripe I have about this movie is
that at three hours it is too long, but don't let that
stop you from going to see this fine example of
how movies should be made.
film: ulysses' gazeenny 1
Ulysses' Gaze stars Harvey Keitel as A", a Greek
film maker working in the United States who
returns to his home town of Ptolemais, after a
thirty-five year absence, for a screening of his lat-
est controversial film. But he is really returning to
make a documentary about the Manakias broth-
ers, the pioneers of the Balkan cinema. Three of
the Manakias' films are believed to be in the
Sarajevo film archive and so A travels through
Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania,
Serbia andfinallyinto Bosnia in search of them.
On his travels, he revisits his past and meets sev-
eral incarnations ofthe same woman with whom
he falls in love with again and again.
Ulysses' Gaze contains many shots of
scenery - a study of shifts of perception and
emotion. At a coccyx-wrenching three hours,
the film possesses qualities which critics seem to
love but which will deter the mainstream
audience.
There is insufficient character development
and any story or plot is masked by director Theo
Angelopoulos' focus on the landscape. The dia-
logue is sparse and partly subtitled; what there is
often sounds stilted. Nevertheless, Ulysses' Gaze
has already won the Grand Jury Prize and the
International Critics' Prize at Cannes and a Felix
award for film of the year.
One feels that the camera work lacks pur-
pose; the camera lingering pointlessly on a scene
for a long length of time. Amazingly, a passage of
several years may occur in just one scene.
No doubt Ulysses' Gaze is intended to be
very deep and meaningful but unfortunately, it
fails to stimulate. This is quite a demanding film
and many will be sitting in the cinema bored and
leaving with sore buttocks.
