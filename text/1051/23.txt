Dear Rachel,
I was intrigued by your comment
in last week's Felix | 1049,
February 9th], alongside the Pro
Rector's letter under Official
Fees Line, that "It seems
remarkable that there is no offi-
cial line from Imperial on this
emotive and controversial issue."
I had thought that the College
position was pretty clear. On
page 3 of the same issvie of Felix
the Rector is reported as having
reiterated Imperial College's
opposition to imposing top-up
fees. IC has no intention of
charging a £300 fee - it would
achieve almost nothing for the
College, he is quoted as saying. I
would have thought this official
enough.
The idea of a £300 charge, for
what I now read is described as a
"government deficit levy", is a
discussion item among 100 plus
Vice- Chancellors. But it will be
for the governing body of each
individual institution to decide
whether such a charge is the best
way of alleviating its financial
problems. The Executive
Committee of the College's
Governing Body fully endorsed
the Rector's view at its meeting
last Friday. And that's official.
Best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
P E Mee
(Registrar and Clerk to the
Governors)
Thank you for putting my
mind at rest. Very good news
indeed!

Look, jokes aside, but is this
actually going to happen, or
what? We've had revised dead-
lines and a reset schedule; gone
planning permission in the
autumn to 'definitely by the end
of 1995' to 'we'll still be on tar-
get if we get it by the end of
February.' So now we have the
latest date: Kensington and
Chelsea will begin to consider
the application on March 6th
Perhaps I don't have a clue
what I'm talking about (it is pos-
sible, you know) but surely
we've got to throw some of the
blame from this farcical situation
at our Borough Council. They
hardly seem to be pillars of effi-
ciency, and you would have
thought that being the proud
possessors of one the mest pres-
tigious medical schools about
would be something they could
get a little bit enthusiastic about.
I wonder is it connected that
they are the staunchest Tory
council in the country? It brings a
whole new dimension to the con-
cept of rotten boroughs...
Perhaps I should mention
that I'm pleased to have recruit-
ed a new sub-editor to the Felix
team: Stephen, who has been
battling through the morass of
Clubs and Socs articles for the
past couple of weeks, is also a
keen member of Consoc.

Observing the launch of this
year's sabbatical elections has
been quite thought provoking.
Until I decided I quite fancied
the idea myself, I thought any-
one keen to stick their oar into
ICU affairs was 'a sad hack',
belonging to that mysterious
brand of people who label any-
one not interested the things
that fascinate them as being apa-
thetic.
But at 6pm on Monday,
faced with the deadline of hand-
ing their manifestoes in to be
printed in Felix, eight self-con-
scious and slightly insecure, but
very likeable human beings
trooped in one by one. They all
seemed keen, enthusiastic, but
most strikingly of all, utterly gen-
uine in their desire to contribute
constructively to the needs of
Imperial students. I don't know
why this surprised me so much,
but it was thoroughly uplifting.
I also found it rather inter-
esting to see that, practically
without exception, they seemed
to have great difficulty making
deadline.
