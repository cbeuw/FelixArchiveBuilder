Bar extensions for
I C U in jeopardy
BY ALEX FEAKES
Friday nights at the Union will
soon be coming to an end earlier
than usual due to a cut in the
number of late bar licences grant-
ed by the local constabulary. The
reduced number of late exten-
sions means that the bar will shut
at midnight on Friday nights
instead of the current 1 am.
Talking to Felix, Mark
Home, ICU's Events and Mar-
keting Manager, explained that
the nature of the Union's bar
licence meant that it had to apply
for each bar extension individual-
ly. Recent policy reassessments
and staffing changes in the local
police force have led to nearly
sixty percent of previously
passed bar extension applications
being rejected.
No reasons have been given
for rejecting the applications, and
Mr Home was keen to point out
that there had been no com-
plaints from local residents about
the bar or people leaving the
Union late at night. He stressed
that ICU's relationship with the
police has always been amicable,
insisting that the police had an
'understanding' of ICU's special
situation.
Mr Home said that the
Union was looking into other
types of bar licences to try to cir-
cumvent the problem in the
future. The two currently under
scrutiny are a 'supper-club
licence' and a 'club licence with
exemptions', both of which
would allow the bar to be open
late without having to apply indi-
vidually for each extension.
However, the former would
require there to be food served
during the evening, which could
prove to be difficult, and the lat-
ter could require some expansion
and upgrading of the building's
facilities.
When asked about the rami-
fications of the cut in late
licences for the end of term car-
nival, Mr Home would only reply
that the matter "was in hand."
He gave assurances that the night
was fully booked and still on
course to happen.
Shephard promises
talks with C V C P
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals met
last Friday to discuss the looming
crisis over higher education fund-
ing. The Government's Educat-
ion Secretary, Gillian Shepherd,
had promised to deliver a
timetable for discussion of fund-
ing proposals in time for the
meeting, in an attempt to avert
threatened action by the com-
mittee (Felix 1050).
The meeting took place
amid the continuing row over
funding between the Govern-
ment and university heads.
Among principals, adherence to
the CVCP's opposition to reduc-
ing student numbers to combat
the cuts is almost universal.
However, the Higher Education
Funding Council for England had
indicated that it might allow uni-
versities to take in less than their
contracted number of students.
Reducing student intake is a
method used by some colleges to
save money.
When the deadline for spec-
ifying intended intake levels ran
out a few days ago, only one uni-
versity had applied to cut num-
bers. The university has not been
named, but it is believed to be
one of the larger 'new' universi-
ties. In a late development, the
Government agreed to set up a
working party for the whole issue
of higher education funding.
Union capital
funding slashed
BY MIKE INGRAM
Imperial College Union is to
have its capital spending budget
slashed by 28% next year. The
cuts are being imposed by the
College to offset funding cuts of
over 31% imposed in last year's
Budget.
The money is used by the
Union to finance facilities and
equipment used by clubs and
societies. It is distributed by the
Union Funding Council (UFC),
which assesses the five-year bud-
get plans submitted by clubs.
According to some, these bud-
gets have already been "cut to
the bone".
The implications of the cuts
were discussed at the last U F C
meeting on Tuesday. Matt
Crompton, DP(F&S) told Felix
that the Union may be forced to
use money from its trading out-
lets to make up the difference.
He said that the Union was
"going to try to get money [if
possible]", and that it would be
"dreadful coming to terms with"
cutting budgets any further.
Using up the revenue from
trading could have an effect on
ICU's future in Beit Quad. The
profits had previously been ear-
marked for improvements to the
Union building and its facilities.
After the controversy over the
Estates Department's proposal to
move the Union into the
Sherfield building, it was made
clear that changes to the building
would be necessary (Felix 1038).

ICU supports nursery-
imperial College's Nursery was
the recipient of a donation by
ICU this week. The cheque for
Â£104.86 was a combination of
money raised by the Royal
School of Mines Union, the
weekly bar quizzes in Da Vinci's
and sales of matches in the
Union's two bars.
Gates locked at night
Access from Imperial College
Road to Queen's Gate and Prince
Consort Road will soon be cur-
tailed. The two exits from the
college are to be closed between
the hours of 11 pm and 6 am.
The decision to close the
gates was taken for security and
safety reasons and will be effec-
tive from the 1st March. The
West Precinct, in front of the
Rector's residence, 170 Queen's
Gate, is felt to be a particular
security risk.
Nick Black, Estates M a -
nager, explained that College
was "concerned that anyone
could get in" during those hours.
He predicted that only a small
number of students would be
affected by the closure, and said
that the main objections to the
closure had been from the col-
lege catering staff.
Although there are alterna-
tive entrances to the college
grounds from Exhibition Road,
the status of Imperial College
Road as a public right of way is
considered a 'grey area'.
Beit clock's stoppage
Beit Quad's clock, hanging above
the entrance to the Union, was
repaired this week after one of
its hands became 'mis-aligned'.
Time was restored on
Wednesday after a three day
break.
Correction
The band named in last week's
Felix as having dropped out of a
gig due to one of its members
being banned from the Union
was not 'Herb' as stated but was
in fact the band 'Neither Both'.
Felix apologies for any confusion.
