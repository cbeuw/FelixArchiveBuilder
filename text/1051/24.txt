ICBC 4 - 0 OXFORD
Last weekend, the ICBC's 1st
and 2nd eights met the Oxford
University Boat Race crews. It
was a fairly intense affair, with
IC starting on the outside of the
Chiswick bend, and not sidfering
from this early disadvantage.
Although Oxford had a fast
cruising pace, they couldn't
match the explosive acceleration
of the IC VIII's. They have obvi-
ously improved, as shown by the
fact that IC later admitted to
have been pushed hard for the
win, coming in almost a length
ahead in both races.
The 2nd eight showed that
strength in depth is not dead at
IC when a crew made up largely
of freshers easily overhauled
their Oxford counterparts. Their
bowman and ICBC captain Andy
Kershaw to commented: "I am
very proud of the boys, they rose
to the challenge of Oxford, and
we dominated them from the
outset."
CROSS COUNTRY TAKE A
HYDING IN BAD PUN
SHOCKER
With vociferous IC support, the
1996 Hyde Park Relays were
underway. The Imperial team
ran well and Jon Johnson,
despite being weighed down,
won himself a pint after leaving
Tom for dead. This, however
was all that IC won, with
Cambridge taking the men's
event, and U L U winning the
ladies prize.
IC LADIES DOMINATE 4-A
SIDE FOOTBALL
Last Monday the IC Ladies took
the University of London invita-
tional tournament by storm.
After the league stage, both
IC teams had done enough to
qualify for the semi-finals,
where they met each other.
After a surprisingly close con-
test, the first team won and
went on to lift the shield after an
incredibly tense penalty shoot-
out was won 4-2.

Going On?
IC 16-11 SURREY
Even lacking their three interna-
tional fencers, IC fencing squad
battled through to the last 16
with a nail-biting victory over
Surrey. The foil started off well,
with IC winning 6-3, with two
of the losing fights on the last
point.
As always this season, epee
proved to be our weakest
weapon although we went down
a respectable 4-5, thanks to a
great 5-4 win by Ed Rysdale
against Surrey's Rumanian inter-
national epeeist. This left sabre
as the decider, and IC took an
early lead to require one of the
last four fights for victory. The
first two went to Surrey, and IC
captain Nick Manton found
himself 14 down in the third,
before battling back to score the
winning hit at 4-4.
The final fight also went to
IC giving a final victory of 16-11.
The other team members were,
as usual, Reuben "Wild Thing"
Kalam, and Charles "Criminal
Mastermind" Cooper.

Hockey win
IC hockey blokes 3rd team
romped their way into the
BUSA quarter-finals, with a late
win over neighbours U C L .
With the scores level at half
time, Apeman's goal looked to
have clinched the tie, until
plucky little U C L pulled one-
back. Extra time saw IC come
out fighting with characteristic
aplomb; Vidal and Rab both
found the net to take the final
tally to 3-1. It was an immense-
ly satisfying win for the hockey
boys.
