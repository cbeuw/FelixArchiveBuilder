Charity records. They're a bit of a mixed bunch
really. On the one hand you have such genuinely
great albums as 'Help', but then again it's all too
easy to cobble together a bunch of singles and
release them for a good cause. Speaking of which,
Survival campaignsforthe rights of tribal peoples,
helping them to overcome those that seek to
oppress and exploit them. But then I'm not here
to assess the charity...
What you get for your money is an eclectic
dance compilation. The tracks range from ambi-
ent tracks by the Sabres of Paradise, Jam and
Spoon and Spooky, through Slab's Chemical
Brothers-esque trip-hop, to trancey and house
tunes, including a great trance mix of The
Shamen's 'Transamazonia'. Most of the tracks are
either from albums, such as Leftfield's Afro-Left',
or new mixes of singles, including the quite mag-
nificent Underworld mix of Dreadzone's classic
'Zion Youth'.
All in all, this is a worthy purchase, especially
ifyou don't already have the album tracks. In fact,
apart from the staid Moby track, every tune is
good. Most of them even have tribal references
which brings us back to the fact that this is all for
a good cause. What more could you ask for? (8)

-album: speech - speech^
This is the debut solo album from Speech, for-
merly front man with Arrested Development. In
fact, you could be forgivenforthinking that his
excellent new single, 'Like Marvin Gaye Said',
was by Arrested Development. This album,
however, shows that Speech can turn his hand to
other styles too.
Tracks like 'Let's Be Hippies' sound just like
'Lovesexy'-era Prince, right down to the soppy
strings, the guitar histrionics and Speech sounding
uncannily like the purple one. Most the tunes
have a soulful, funky early '80s feel, and they sit
well alongside the smooth beats and breaks.
The lyrics display Speech's social conscience,
as we have come to expect from his previous
stuff, but it is never cliched or patronising. We are
allowed to have fun too, as on the old skool 'Can
You Hear Me?"
While he might have overstretched himself
in places in the name of variety, this is a very un-
tenable album and it ought to sell well. (8)

The Brotherhood are going to shatter a lot of peo-
hip-hop.
'Elementalz' is an assured
bal assault on the evils in British sodi
Nation, or the slteer irreverance of Honky which
diaracterises a lot of British pop-rap efforts. This
is very much a rap allium for rap fans, but the
range of issues covered and the luiending stream
