RCS Dinner
The RCS Annual Dinner was held at the
Kensington Hilton Hotel last Friday. Tickets
were sold out as 250 people arrived in their
glad rags to witness one oi the most success-
ful RCS events in recent years.
The after-dinner speaker was Stephanie
Snell, RCS president 1988/89. She finished
on a happy note as she, with encouragement
from her audience, persuaded Mo to do his
'party piece'. Dinner was then officially over
with a remarkable and appreciated lack of
traditions such as the kangela and penalty
pints. As Mo explained later: "It was more
important for people to enjoy themselves
than get lost in traditions many of them
would not understand".
The band Bandicoot arrived looking
most peculiar in black wigs, but their music
did not correspond to their dress sense and a
good time was had by all. The band was then
replaced by a disco, DJ'd by one of the
minibus drivers. Unfortunately the minibus-
es turned into London Buses as arrival and
leaving times became delayed. Many diners
continued the party in the hotel foyer, to the
amusement of the hotel staff, whilst they
awaited transport to their respective beds.
