A n 8 - w e e k insight into the role
of IT in international business
Just one more year to go at university. Isn't it time

Technology in the business world?
Unilever is one of the world's largest manufacturing
companies. Behind global sales in excess of £30 billion
lies the competitive advantage IT delivers. This
summer you could be among a select number of
penultimate year students - of any discipline - who
will have the opportunity of making a valid contribution
within IT, working at one of our key operational sites
around the UK. By working on real business issues,
you will gain practical experience of what it feels like
to bridge the gap between IT and its successful
application within our fast moving business.
Also, not only will you be developing an understanding
of technology in business, you will be gaining
the ability to assess your own management
potential within Unilever. All this and
you'll be earning £200 a week, for an
8-week period from July to September.

your summer vacation? Then ask for an application
