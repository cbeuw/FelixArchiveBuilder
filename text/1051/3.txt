NEWS FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD 1996 . THREE
Turntable thieves elude security net
BY D I P A K G H O S H
Imperial College Union's enter-
tainments received a temporary
blow last week when disco equip-
ment worth nearly El000 myste-
riously disappeared from the
Union building, amid suspicion of
student involvement in the theft.
The equipment, including a
Technics turntable, was reported
missing last Friday when the
evening's entertainments were
being set up. The equipment was
last used the previous week, the
9th of February, and was secured
in a sturdy flight case after the
night's disco. Sometime during
that week, someone opened the
cases and unbolted the turntables
from their mounts and took them
from the building.
Mark Home, ICU's
Entertainment and Marketing
Manager, has been scanning secu-
rity videos for clues to the cul-
prits, though admits that the
crime is puzzling. "At least two
people must be involved in this
theft as the equipment is too
heavy to be carried by one per-
son. They obviously knew what
they were taking, as the expen-
sive gear was taken and the rela-

tively cheaper mixer was left. We
suspect that students were
involved."
The Beit archway was the
only possible exit route from the
quad since all exterior doors were
locked due to the Mountbatten
Festival in the Royal Albert Hall
last week. The video evidence
seems to indicate that the equip-
ment is still within the buildings
in the Beit Quad, but Mr Home
speculated that the thieves have
most probably escaped with the
decks already.
The Police have informed
local dealers of disco equipment
to be aware of anyone trying to
sell gear matching the description
of the stolen items. They have
also appealed to students who
might know anything of the
crime to speak to Union officials
as soon as possible.
C&G fill Union posts, but
voters stay away again
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Voting in the the City & Guilds
College Union ( C & G C U ) elec-
tions took place on Monday and
Tuesday of this week. The posts
on the C & G C U were filled, with
the current Overseas Societies
Committee chair, Gaurav Misra,
being voted in as president after
the 4th count.
One of the failed candidates,
Alex Tylee-Birdsall, said that he
"expected not to win really" and
wished Gaurav well, saying that
he was "very happy for him...he's
a good guy." Alex will stay on in
his current role as the Motor
Club's captain but said he may
run for the job next year. Andy
Gilder was elected to the post of
Vice-president with Hannah
Pearson as Hon Sec.
The turnout for the election
was low, with only 276 votes out
of a possible 3000 being cast.
The response was marginally bet-
ter than last year's, when an elec-
torate of only 190 students regis-
tered their preference.
Jez Clayton, the C & G C U
current Honorary Secretary, said
that the turnout of about 10%
"isn't too bad, considering that
only 50% of students had Union
cards." He said that some stu-
dents had got I C U cards espe-
cially for the occasion.
The post of Honorary
Treasurer was filled by its cur-
rent incumbent, Simon Cope,
and Computing first-year Ling Li
was voted in as Publicity Officer.
The current VP, Duncan Tindall,
has been elected to the post of
C & G College Association repre-
sentative.

Campaigning in the Imperial
College Union sabbatical elec-
tions has started slowly, though
commentators were reassured by
a late flurry in enthusiasm as last
minute canvassing saw all candi-
dates fully nominated.
Sarah Corneille, a member
of the women's rugby team, reg-
istered her intention to stand for
the position of Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) with only
an hour to spare before nomina-
tions closed. She is opposed by
James Handley and Neil
O'Shaughnessy. The presidential
position is the only other post
that will be contested. Eric
Allsop, Mark Bridge and Luke
Morales are standing for the job.
Piers Williams and Alex
Feakes remain unopposed in
Sabbs race
"lacklustre"
their bids to become Deputy
President (Finance and Services)
and Felix Editor and Print Unit
Manager respectively.
Voters in the elections,
which will take place on March
4th and 5th throughout college,
will also have the opportunity to
call for a new election to be run.
Nominations would then be
reopened next term, allowing
further candidates to stand. The
current Deputy Presidents, Tim
Townend and Matt Crompton,
have been mandated to run the
New Election campaign, but
have as yet failed to publicise it
as a voting option at all.
Hustings will take place in
the Ents lounge (South
Kensington) next Tuesday, and
in Gladys (St Mary's) on
Wednesday, both at 6pm.
