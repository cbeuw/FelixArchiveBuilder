What Does A Sabbatical
Officer Do Over Summer?
Hello and welcome to the first of the
many 'Presidents's bits' youH be
getting from me. Keep reading for
scintillating prose, sparkling wit, the
truth and nothing but...well maybe
not; but then this is FELIX after all.
Since July 1st, when Jackie,
Dave, Dave and I took over, the
question I've been asked time and
time again (apart from 'which way to
the ladies toilets/Summer
Accommodation Centre/bar?) is:
What does a sabbatical do in the
summer? A very good question it i»
too. A month ago I would have said
'not too much' but now I know
better. Quite apart from cleaning
and tidyir>g up the office and
scrubbing the official President's
room from top to bottom, there's
been plefity of work to do, although
most of it has been in bits and
pieces. However, 1
1
1 try and outline
a few of the major things I've been
involved with this month.
Training
In at the deep end from the start,
a sabbatical learns the hard way, it
seems. However there was a
training weekend at Wye College,
Kent, organised by the University of
London Union. It involves lots of
talks and workshops on subjects
such as financial planning, coping
with college committees, planning
campaigns, organising Freshers'
week and so on. The value of the
training sessions was limited due to
the diversity of the colleges
involved, but we got some good
ideas and made lots of contacts at
other colleges—stand by for some
good 'joint events'. By the way, Wye
College has a wonderful outdoor
swimming pool—Jackie and I now
know all about being in at the deep
end at 2.30am.
The Bar
The refurbishment of the Union
Snack Bar, 'Norman's' is at last
underway. Expect to see a
complete change: the new, stylish
and comfortable lounge/snack bar
opens in October. By then the
transfer of the bar licence from
College to Jen (our adminstrator)
and Bob Schroter (the Bar's senior
treasurer) should be complete. Due
to the incompetence of certain ex-
sabbaticals we missed the deadline
for the August sitting of the licensing
courts—so now we're going for the
September session. Soon well be
able to call it the student's Union
Bar in all honesty! Maybe well see
you in there....
The FELIX move
If you've been through Beit Quad
recently youll have noticed that it's
full of bits of wood, old sinks,
broken furniture and the like. Yes,
the great FELLX move has started
and brings new excitement every
day. Will the new office be ready on
time? Will it live up to our
expectations? Will Dave Jones ever
smile again?
On a more serious note why was
My life consists of enusing that all
the things the students need from
day to day are in good nick. This
ranges frorm the minibusses to
insurance, and while in the topic of
insurance could all the people on
the list at the bottom of my spiel
please come to the Union office with
ID to collect checks.
During the Summer the life for
the average Hon Sec is really quite
dreary, as it is now the Dodgy Deals
Done Dirty brigade appear. These
boys and girls appear out of the
commercial woodwork as soon as
fresh blood is smelt, and attempt
the old Entertainments Committee
room (where the print room will be
in October) allowed to degenerate
into a filthy, infested mess? It really
was in an apalling state, which made
it difficult for Dan Phillips (who will
chair the Ents committee next year)
and I to justify the need for a new
Ents Office. Nonetheless there will
be a new office on the first floor; I
trust Dan will take good care of it.
As for FELIX the move was not
the Union's idea but we are stuck
with it; now we must ensure that
printing is not interrruped—FELIX
must and will appear as usual at the
start of October. As time and space
don't allow me to go on about
everything that's happening, why
not call into the office if there is
anything specific you want to know
about? Don't expect to see me
there until August 5th though...
that's something else sabbaticals do
during the summer; go on holiday
early, to avoid the rush.
Christine
(inevitably succeeding) to convince
the poor hapless bugger sitting
behind the official desk to buy two
thousand nosefittersbecause of the
pollution in London.
Also the summer is the time for
training the new sabbaticals. The
training takes the form of lecturing
and small work parties that
disappear into little rooms, discuss
things, then make a presentation to
everybody.
The first thing that hit me is how
politically orientated everyody in
Student Unions are, with the LSE
sabbaticals as a general rule being
elected in a 'party line' type
arrangment. That was quite an eye
opener.
At the moment insurance is the
biggest headache with me trying to
assess the claims still outstanding,
and people who've waited too long
for settlements. But I am starting to
see light at the end of the tunnel.
One more small distraction has
been the presence of lots of theatre
companies in the Union Building
rehearsing for the Edinburgh
Fringe. My consciousness has been
widened by the prescence of an
acting company next to the office
acting out a play which involves a
black stallion, a donkey and a young
maiden. I think its a sequel to A Mid-
summernights Dream.
Well bye-bye for now, and I hope
to write again. Any comments
please feel free to express them.
Cheers.
