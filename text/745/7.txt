News FELIX, Friday August 1st 1986 8
FEUX Office On The Move
Conversion work has begun on the
new FELIX Office, which is to be
resited in the disused kitchen area
behind the Lounge. The design for
the new offices was drawn up by
architects Beresford Gray and
Partners and the contractor is W F
Fearman Ltd, the firm which also
undertook the recent work on the
old Botany-Zoology common
room. The cost of the work is to be
approximately £50,000, and the
expected completion date is August
31st. The contractors are
understood to be confident of
meeting this deadline, which will be
essential if FELIX is to move offices
early in September. If the move is
undertaken any later the production
of FELIX, and other print Union
work, will be severely disrupted.
The preliminary site-clearing met
with an early set-back on
Wednesday when the contractors
were unable to switch off the
electricity and water mains for the
Lounge kitchen area, in order to
allow drilling work to proceed.
College Estates Section were unable
to isolate the area as required.
The move of the FELIX office
will displace the Entertainments
Committee from their office and
storeroom behind the serving area
in the Lounge. A replacement
storeroom will be built across the
stage end of the Lounge, adjacent to
Squat Ends
the new FELIX offices. A new office
for the Ents Committee is being
built at the rear of the UDH
Kitchens on the first floor of the
Union Building.
The cycling club workroom will
also be moved as a result of the
move of the FELIX office and Beit
Hall TV lounge. A new TV
Lounge/party room is to be built in
the basement of Beit Hall Old
Hostel, involving the loss of three
bedrooms and the laundry room.
"Beit Hall will extend its control on
the first floor and gain the cycling
club storeroom as a laundry room,
so taking over the remaining space
not occupied by the new FELIX
office. It is currently intended to re-
house cycling club in the old Tennis
equipment storeroom, next to the
tennis courts in Princes Gardens.
Cycling club secretary Martin Bell
was not aware of the loss of the
storeroom until two weeks ago.
Union Deputy President Jackie
Pierce has not yet been able to
obtain a key for the old tennis store
and so cannot say whether it will be
suitable as a cycling club workroom.
Union Glider In Doubt
Police were called to the former
Libyan consulate in the early hours
of Tuesday morning, after guests at
a party organised by the squatters
began wrecking the building.
Around 30 people wrew arrested
although most of these were later
released. One person has been
charged with criminal damage.
The squatters were due to be
moved out after an eviction order
was granted in the High Court. By
the time of the party it seems that
most of the squatters had already
moved out of the building. Police
were informed of the disturbance by
local residents and arrived at 58
Princes Gardens tofindthe building
being vandalised. After calling for
reinforcements they moved in to
make the arrests.
The consulate was guarded by
police throughout Tuesday and was
boarded up on Wednesday. A
private security firm are guarding
the building from inside. Local
Police Constable Andy Nimmons
said that the damage done to the
consulate was estimated to be
between £1 million and £2 million.
FELIX was unable to get any
comment from the Libyan interest
section of the Saudi Arabian
embassy or the Foreign Office.
IC Union will not be able to afford a
new glider this year, unless College
administration increase the amount
available to the Union on an
interest-free loan. It was originally
intended to purchase a new glider
with £13,000 borrowed from
College. A further £10,000 is also
required on loan for the
refurbishment of the Union Snack
Bar, however, and College Deputy
Secretary Mr Brian Lloyd Davies,
until today the College Financial
Secretary, has told Union Deputy
President Jackie Pierce that only
£10,000 will be available to the
Union. Miss Pierce is hopeful that
some of the Lounge Bar
refurbishment costs will be covered
by the Union's carryover, which
may make more money available
for the new glider. She expressed
disappointment in the response
from College, bearing in mind the
£28,000 recently spend on
alterations to the Queen's Tower,
and the £90,000 which it will cost to
refurbish the Sherfield refectory.
Miss Pierce confirmed that the
Lounge bar refurbishment work
was preceding on schedule. The
redecoration work is expected to
begin at the start of September, and
the floor covering will be laid and
the furniture delivered two weeks
later. Miss Pierce said that the
Lounge bar would be painted in a
pink colour but added that 'they will
like it when they see it', and said that
the Union was going for a 'warmer
atmosphere' in the bar. She later
commuted her description of the
chosen colour to 'not very pink'.
Union snack bar Manager Mr
Norman Jardine was telephoned
recently to be asked his opinion on
the redecoration. He is understood
to be severely indifferent to the
colour scheme.

Physics Department has been

Pete's Party
Former IC Radio Station Manager
and Computing Student Pete
Coleman made use of all his slick wit
and charm when cautioned by a
WPC during his 'term-time' stag
night at the" Old Ship,
on Thursday June 19th. Mr
Coleman was congratulating
himself on having avoided arrest
when the uniformed young lady
removed all her clothes.
The strip-o-gram was arranged by
former FELIX editor Hugh
Southey who commented that 'Pete
was too drunk to get embarrassed'.
Mr Coleman described his present
as 'quite a handful', before drinking
another half pint of creme de
menthe and sliding gently under the
table.
Mr Coleman will be getting
married on August 9th. FELIX
would like to wish him and his bride
to be, Miss Mandy Thornton, all the
very best for the future.
NUS Pledge
The London regional secretary of
the National Union of Students, Mr
Vaughen West, intends to get IC
Union into the NUS by the end of

'Pledge' follows the remarkable
success NUS had in persuading
Kings College (KQC) to affiliate to
NUS.
