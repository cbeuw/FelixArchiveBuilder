Last night the boiler room under the
Biochemistry building was severly
flooded to a depth of at least six feet.
The water was discovered at around
10.00pm, but the Chelsea fire brigade
were not called out until 11.00pm,
after maintainence engineers had
tried to pump out the building with
their own pumps. Attempts by
firemen to break down doors trapping
the floodwater were thwarted by
electrical short circuiting until the
power supply to large section of the
Chemistry and Biochemistry building
was cut.
The clear up operation was
expected to last most of the night,
with four fire engines summoned to
the scene. At the time of going to
press, technicians and firemen were
attempting to seal of valves in the
boiler room, hopefully preventing
furtherflooding.The central stores
and Chemistry sub-basements are not
flooded,and the tunnels beneath
College are believed to be safe.
College Assistant Secretary Michael
Arthur is confident that the Queen's
Tower will become one of London's
major tourist attractions. The tower
has been opened to the public for the
first time this summer and is likely
to make an operating loss of£10,000
over thirteen weeks. This is in
addition to an initial capital outlay
of £15,000 which was spent on safety
work, before visitors were allowed
into the Tower.
Mr Arthur told FELIX that the
Tower could not be expected to
show a profit in the early stages, as it
would take time for interest to build
up. He also stressed that it had been
important to adapt a low key
approach to publicising the Tower
before the organisation of guided
groups had been properly tried and
tested. He said that he now had a
system which worked very well, and
that the guides had coped easily with
a group of 50 people who had visited
the Tower recently.
Up to the middle of this week,
approximately 1500 people had
visited the tower, with the highest
figure on any day being 128. The
lowest attendance to date is 23. At
the current staffing level the Tower
needs approximately 170 per day, at
a charge of 60 pence, to cover
runnning costs.
Mr Arthur, who has taken the
initiative in getting the project off
the ground, expects that the Queen's
Tower will eventually become as
popular as the Monument, which
has 500 visiters per day. In the light
of this, and the fact that the Tower
had 440 visitors in under 3 hours on
the day of Rag Fete, he is expecting
there to be between 500 and 1000
visitors per day. He agreed,
however, the scheme is unlikely to
attract enough visitoers daily to
balance running costs before the end
of the summer.
Mr Arthur explained that it had
been impossible to contemplate a
mass publicity campaign to launch
the opening, since the day of the
completion of alterations had been
uncertain. In addition the scheme
had to be approved by the insurerss.
Since the Tower opened, a press
release has been distributed widely
throughout London, and leafletting
has been used in Exhibition Road
and in Knightsbridge. The Tower
was featured on Thames News on
July 16th, and was also featured on
LBC and in the Times Higher
Education Supplement.
Mr Arthur feels that he now has a
better feel of what sort ofpublicity is
required. He has written to Hotels
and to all ground handlers who deal
with tourist trips in London. He
hopes that the Queen's Tower will
shortly be included in various
London tourist guides. He added
that everyone who has climbed the
Tower appeared to have enjoyed it,
and that he envisaged that the
scheme would have a positive
publicity effect for IC.
