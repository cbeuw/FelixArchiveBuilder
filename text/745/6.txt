Reviews FELIX, Friday August 1st 1986 7
A Colder Climate is set in
London's East End; a place
where illegal dog and cock
fights, boxing, racism,
unwanted pregnancies and
stand up comics blend to form
todays community. The
underlying stability/instability
of the characters involved
revolves around a pub-running
family and the problems it
faces in a society where only
the tough survive.
There are places where A
Colder Climate deals well with
specific issues, particularly
racism. But the majority of the
performances lack feeling and
'conviction in themselves or in
their relations to each other.
This seems to be a function of
a script that generally ill-
defines characters, using
them, at times, solely as a
vehicle for social comment.
Ron Pember, the ageing father
of the landlady, and David
Beames, alternating between
spiv, policeman and boxing
coach, are notable exceptions.
A Colder Climate aims for
reality but fails to achieve this.
In attempting to deal with too
many of the world's problems,
it glosses over them.

Aliens in Camden?
Aliens, the sequel to the
1979 film Alien, could well
have been called Terminator 2
were it not for the fact that the
protagonist was biological this
time and not Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Aliens, like
Terminator is written/directed
by James Cameron, and many
of the cast of Terminator also
appear in Aliens with the
notable exception of
Sigourney Weaver. It is not
surprising that Aliens shares
many similarities with the
earlier film: an unkillable
enemy, lots of shiney
weaponry and the eventual
defeat of the bad guys on their
home ground.
Warrent Officer Ripley
(Weaver) is picked up 57 years
after the destruction of the
spaceship Nostromo and the
original Alien. At first her story
is disbelieved because of the
cost of the spaceship she
destroyed, but when contact is
lost with a crew sent to the
Aliens planet she is forced to
return in an advisory capacity
with a troup of marines on a
rescue mission. On the planet
they are ambushed and
wholesale slaughter follows.
Conveniently, they damage a
nuclear reactor in such,a way
as to give themselves a
timelimit to get off the planet.
The rest of the film involves a
fight to keep the aliens at bay
while coaxing the orbiting
mother ship to send down a
rescue pod.
The film concentrates quite
heavily on weaponry (a hobby
of Cameron's) coming up with
some futuristic but
nevertheless believeable
military hardware, and
because of this Aliens an
action movie as opposed to
the cat and mouse thriller of
the original. Other
concessions to the 'profit
principal' are a romantic
interest for Officer Ripley in
the form of Corporal Hicks
(Michael Biehn who played
the male hero in Terminatorl)
and a cute, but tough
kid/mascot in the form of nine
year old Carrie Henn. Aliens is
a film well worth going to see
if only for the Clash of the
Titans style ending.
