News FELIX, Friday August 1st 1986 3
RCSU Blocked
Out
Royal College of Science Union
Officers discovered this week that
they could no longer get into their
office, when a brick wall was built
between the spiral staircase entrance
by the side of the Southside Shop
and the door to their office.
The problem began last month
when it was decided to turn the
empty room above the shop and the
space occupied by Microclub into a
postgraduate married flat, without
consulting the RCSU whose office is
next door. Construction had
already begun when it was realised
just what was involved; the loss of
one toilet and no right of way
between the spiral staircase and the
office. This effectively means that
only residents of Southside halls can
have access, through the door
opposite the Selkirk end lifts.
FELIX was unable to gain any
positive response from the Estates
section on how Union members are
going to be able to get into their
office in the future.
Postgraduate
Group
The IC Union Postgraduate Group
needs better publicity, it decided at
its recent Annual General Meeting
held on June 26th. The group
represents all the Postgraduates at
IC, both within the Union and on
College Committees, although it has
had a history of low involvement.
True to form, only about a dozen
PG's turned up, to re-elect Gareth
Fish, Helan Brawell and Chris
Martin as Chair, Secretary and
Treasurer respectively. Sam
Chittendon was elected PG
Womens rep.
Chris Martin was also elected to
edit the Postgraduate Handbook, a
Union publication with information
for both final year students
interested in Postgraduate Courses,
and new postgraduates arriving at
IC. He is looking for anyone who
would be interested in writing or
becoming involved in this
production.
Gareth Fish, starting his second
year in office, urged all the
postgraduates at IC to become
involved in the group, and indicated
that a small amount of money was
available for anyone organising a
Departmental Postgrad Party. A
PG Cricket match, and a picnic are
being organised for the summer, he
added.
The Postgraduate Group can be
contacted via the Union Office.
The recently installed sophisticated
and powerful Copeman-Hart
electronic organ, incorporating the
latest digital technology and
purchased by the Queensgate Trust,
is now available for the use of
students. The organ has already
been played during the Orchestra's
Spring Concert and during the last
two Choir concerts and proved an
Slammer
Shocker
A group of five staff and students
from IC spend an afternoon in
Wormwood Scrubs last Friday
when they took part in a game of
backgammon against a team of
prisoners. The only stakes allowed
were Mars bars, and the College
team were rapidly cleared out by the
inmates. The trip was organised by
Mr Roy Francis of DOC who
described the day as very enjoyable
and hoped that it would be possible
to organise similar events in the near
future.
FELIX Car
Rally
The annual FELIX car rally held on
Saturday June 21st was won by a
team from City and Guilds Union.
The Guilds team finished well ahead
of the other three entrants, thanks
largely to the acquisition of a
Chelsea College Sabbatical, which
earned them a massive 50 points on
the scoresheet.
invaluable addition to the musical
facilities at the College.
Those requiring access to the
organ should contact Professor E H
Brown, Room 439, Civil
Engineering building (internal 4722)
to be put on a list of users; no
auditions are required but users
should be fairly competent at
playing the piano.
Eric Earns
Award
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash, has
been awarded a Royal Society Royal
Medal for 'outstanding researches
on acoustic microscopy leading to
wholly new techniques.'
He was one of the first to
recognise the possibilities of using
surface acoustic waves in delay lines,
now used extensivly in TV and radio
receivers. More recently, with his
group at UCL, ha has developed a
scanning acoustic microscope with a
greater resolution than optical
microscopes, and also shown how
surface acoustic waves can be used
to characterise materials. His work
has many potential applications,
only a few of which have been
realised to date.
Climbing
Wall
The climbing wall has at last arrived
in College. The wall is useable now,
though installation will take a few
more weeks to complete. Why not
come along to the Walkway under
Elec Eng and try it?

you'd
rather
We'll get you there!
