"Shit!, you make me feel like
Arlo Guthrie at Woodstock!" The
words of one Mr Loudon
Wainright III performing on the
main stage at this year's
Glastonbury Festival held on the
weekend of 21/22 June. It is
tempting indeed to make
comparisons between the hordes
pushing speed and the odd ugly
character selling blotting paper
as acid. There was little to stop it
all and few to care about that.
However it was also apparent •
that heroin would have been
extremely unwelcome; rumours
circulated of an unfortunate fate
awaiting smack dealers.
A HIPPY FESTIVAL ?
of festival goers who flocked to
Worthy Farm in the idyllic
Wiltshire countryside and a
previous generation who first
attracted the title 'hippies', that
the press like to attach to both
groups. But a closer look will
revea! that it is very difficult to
classify the modern festival
audience. In fact even the
description 'audience' isn't totally
accurate. It is the mass of
punters who really make an
event like Glastonbury what it is.
Not so the big one day affairs
like Donnington which tend to
be merely outdoor heavy metal
concerts.
The famous pyramid is only
the centre of a huge sprawling
tent city within which is a whole
microcosm of society.
Organisation is not obvious and
that is why a lot of people go.
But at the same time a lot of
preparation must have gone into
the site in which this anarchic
assembly occurs with such
apparent smoothness. A
thousand and one vans and
stalls dispensed fast food to suit
virtually any conceivable diet. Ail
night long stoned DJs on the
pirate Radio Avalon' played
floating space music for the
earthbound starchildren. At
every turn there was someone
hawking hand made
merchandise of all descriptions.
This was, despite appearances, a
capitalist dreamworld; not just a
festival of entertainment but also
an alternative economy.
There were, of course, the
inevitable drug dealers. Signs
declared that anyone advertising
drugs would be ejected from the
site, so instead they shouted
their spiel as they wandered
about. Mainly it was marajuana
on sale along with a fair number
of bikers and Rastafarians
As for a general description of
festival goers, the best that can
be said is that they were ail
casually dressed. From Volvo
driving families camped near the
main approach road to convoy
people in the 'Green' field, via
students, punks, Rastas, bikers
and Level 42 fans there seemed
to be most sorts. My own two
overwhelming impressions were
of the sheer geographical size of
the place and of the lack of
trouble. Tents sprawled over hills
so that nowhere could you stand
and see the whole site (the
exception being in the helicopter
flying somewhat expensive
sightseeing trips). Estimates put
the attendance at between
85,000 and 100,000 which shoud
at first sight be good news for
CND who, despite the lack of a
strong anti-nuclear stance at the
festival, receive more money
from it than any other source.
However the crowd was far
above official limits, swelled by
vast numbers who simply walked
in without tickets across
surrounding fields where there
was nothing to stop them.
Perhaps the spirit of the free
festival lives on.
But at Glastonbury it may
have to take a break. Farmer and
organiser Michael Eavis says his
family and the surrounding
residents need a rest from the
annual invasion. There may have
to be a complete re-think of the
event in view of its soaring
growth since the free festival
beginnings in 1971. Far from this
being a 'band aid' style charity
the fees charged by headline
bands are threatening the
financial viability.
There is also the question of
free festivals, which Glastonbury
is undeniably not. It is
Glastonbury more than anything
This year's Glastonbury CND festival was the
largest ever. Since the original free festival in
1971 there has been some considerable
change. Is it a legal version of Stonehenge or a
else which diverted people from
the fiasco around Stonehenge.
So the question must arise as to
what will happen next year.
What will fill the obvious
demand for a mass escape for
tens of thousands of people
from the humdrum of normal
life? What with Dr. and The
Medics reaching number one
and Suzanne Vega storming the
CD and album charts it seems to
be getting trendy to be a touch
hippy-like. There is a possibility
of a movement for a national
free festival, so who knows? By
next June even The Face may
be telling its readers to head for
their nearest ancient site with
Kaftan and 'vege' burger in
hand!
The Entertainment
Glastonbury Festival centres on
an ingenious pyramid shaped
barn which doubles once a year
as a superb main stage which
this year saw an impressive bill
of big name acts. However even
more impressive in some
respects was the vast array of
assorted acts and events at a
total of eight other venues. In
the cinema marquee nightly bills
of decidely unalternative films
were interrupted only by
televised coverage of the equally
unalternative England v
Argentina match.
Perhaps a more festive
atmosphere was to be found up
at the acoustic stage where any
number of acts not requiring ten
million watts of amplification
appeared. The simple marquee
and stage were certainly not an
indication of a lack of talent.
Neither love nor money could
have got you near the place on
Saturday for Billy Bragg and
Loudon Wainright III. While on
Sunday one of the surprises of
the weekend as far as I was
concerned was Maria Muldaur
who proved she is an extremely
talented blues singer indeed.
The vast emotional and volume
range of her voice was backed
up by some faultless playing
from a guitarist who managed to
sound just a bit reminiscent of B
B King. For some odd reason
Maria Muldaur was switched to
the smaller stage at short notice
but she could easily have
upstaged some of the
re-enactment of Woodstock for the Yuppie
generation. FELIX official aging hippy Mark
Cottle went along camera in hand to find out
and even paid to get in!
supposedly big name pop
groups in the main field.
As the main schedule wound
up after dark the 'Big Orange
Cabaret' took to the boards in
the acoustic marquee. This was
very much the lunatic fringe,
presenting more alternative
cabaret than you could hope to
find in Covent Garden in
months. From feminist blues
guitarists to ranting folk freaks
they were all presented with
suave style. My favourites were
The Brighton Bottle Orchestra a
pair of dinner suited loonies who
can be found appearing on the
Edinburgh Fringe in the not too
distant future.
Back on the main stages all
three days oozed national talent
elbowing for a space between
midday and midnight. Clashes
between acts on different stages
meant a decidedly subjective
view of the bill. Generously
people like Messrs Bragg and
Loudon Wainright performed on
three separate occasions.
Headlining on Friday night were
the Psychadelic Furs who
managed to be somewhat less
than psychadelic despite a lavish
light show in the pyramid. An
exception was their final encore
'India', which was perhaps the
best of their first album and an
acknowledgement of the
superiority of that material.
Earlier in the day had seen the
Pogues performing with
abandon.
Saturday was, I thought the
high point of the three days.
Approximately two thirty and the
beginning of a lazy hazy
afternoon lying on the grass
found Latin Quarter fitting the
atmosphere perfectly. Most
people I know either love or hate
their brand of semi ethnic pop
with a political edge. But at that
time of day they were the perfect
Glastonbury Festival band and
their pleas to make the anti
aparthied tee shirt the symbol of
this summer seem well timed.
'Radio Africa' is undeniably their
best number but the other
material grows on you if you
listen.
Following on from the
decidely smooth Latin Quarter
was the brash country
outrageousness of Loudon
Wainright III singing about dead
skunks, dead marriages and dog
shit with an honesty that grabs
the gut. Loudon is the height of
good taste in baggy shorts,
shades and baseball hat as he
lays into every topic sacred to
conservative musical
establishment. Actually Loudon
Wainright is an engaging
character who could almost
make you like Americans with
no taste in clothes at all and I
eagerly await his wider exposure
in this country. Following
Loudon was John Martyn
displaying dazzling brilliance on
both acoustic and electric guitar.
Perhaps I'm a bit of a cynic but
his more jazzy material lost me.
Instead I went to stage 2 to
see darlings of the independent
record charts Half Man Half
Biscuit who did a competent
impersonation of Half Man Half
Biscuit last time I saw them. If
they are to have a long term
future they need a new direction
and an extension of their stage
banter beyond 'Ta!'. Other
darlings of the independent
scene Fuzzbox were hot on the
heels of Half Man Half Crumbs.
A lot has been said of the hype
value of four teenage schoolgirls
who can't play but that doesn't
seem awfully important. Anyone,
like me, old enough to
remember punk rock might
remember a group called the
Slits who managed to rip off a
lot of Fuzzbox's sound before
they even thought of it. Perhpas
I'm a little too cynical, there's
certainly no denying the
enthusiasm the Fuzzboxed put
into their act and in the end its
entertainment value that counts.
Use your own taste to judge.
Saturday headliners The Cure
•showed they are fully
established as a 'Big Name' band
both by the spectacular nature
of their show and the fee they
extorted. Higher powers
conveniently conjured up a
thunderstorm to counterptiint
the eyeboggling lazers with
mercifully little actual rain. As
we sat on a hill watching the
lighting circle a far valley my
stoned companion commented
'Hey God's sent us a lightshow',
and so it seemed.
Sunday was something of a
wind down. Early on Irishman
Christy Moore got a reception
better than many a bigger name.
The song I remember most by
him was a poignant ballad by of
all people the late Bobby Sands.
An odd phenomenon but this
was what the crowd loved.
Madness did their stuff in a
surprisingly congrous manner,
filing in with the odd match
report from Mexico. They were
followed by Level 42 who
managed to look not the least
out of place, slick as ever.
Final act Gil Scott Heron may
be an outstanding and
outspoken musician but he
somehow failed to stun. Too
much polish for a radical show
perhaps. I still preferred the first
acts on Stage 2. Gerry and Terry
brought infectious rock and roll
enthusiasm while the
omnipresent Loudon Wainright
gave something of a repeat
performance. A tribute to smaller
names maybe? If all that
wasn't enough you could put
money on Lineker scoring first
against Argentina, be
photographed with a python,
sit in a tent and listen to a
stoned pirate DJ or go and learn
about alternative medicine. Then
you could take most of Monday
getting away from the site
Loudon Wainright models
beach bum chic! An alternative bookie? Surely some things never change.
