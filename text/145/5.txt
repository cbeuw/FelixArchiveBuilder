Dear Sir,
Can I ask If anyone in this Coll-
age realises the "South-African Boycott
Society" exists* I might well ask
for only twelve to fifteen people so
far regularly attended the meetings
we held at whioh we discussed ways
of implementing the boycott.
When the,' motion,, condemning the
South-African government p o l i c y of
Apartheid and supporting the boycott,
was passed by our Union I've no need
to say that most of those f i f t e e n
people voted for the motion WHERE ABE
THE REST? These people, who by
t h e i r vote, agree with the boycott,
where are they? - We need help i f we
are to auooeed. Help us p i c k e t i n g
shops every Saturday morning; help
us s e l l i n g the "Boyoott News"j
help at headquarters.
Cannot Imperial College be
ftoved by the suffering of others -
the fact that farm workers are paid
one s h i l l i n g a day; strikes are
forbidden; non-suffrage f o r blacks;
families are broken up e t c etc. AND
etc.
What are the arguments against?
- that non-whites w i l l be the f i r s t
to be h i t by external boycott? This
may be so but every organisation which
commands any important non-white
support i n South A f r i o a i s i n favour
of i t . That i t w i l l have no great
effect.? - "IP THIS BOYCOTT MAKES
TUB. AtfTHORTilES REALISE THAT THE SOBJuD
jitfMEES WILL, "ACTIVELY OPPOSE APAR-
THEID IT WILL HAVE STRUCK A BLOW FOR
FREEDOM AND JUSTICE" - 'Boycott News'.
There are many more pros and
eons. "Boyoott News", whioh w i l l
bo on sale at the end of t h i s week,
I believe answers them a l l .
However why I write t h i s l e t t e r
i s to beg f o r support from those
people who agree with the boycott.
Let us forget our own needs f o r onoe
and see t o the needs of a people who
are so much worse o f f than ourselves.
We have a meeting next Wednesday
lunch hour at 1.15 p.m. i n the Small
Physics Lecture, theatre. W i l l we
have more people ready t o work f a r
t h i s great cause? Or w i l l a l l except
f i f t e e n of us:
"daft the world aside
And b i d i t pass"
Yours sincerely,
J.R.A. Power.

The southern semi-final of the 5th
annual National University Jasz contest
was held i n Reading Town H a l l on the
evening of Aednesday 17th February 1960.
There were ten bands competing - two
from Reading, four from Cambridge and
four fxfim London, including two from
Imperial College. The judges were Alun
Morgan and Benny Green. The r e s u l t was
tab Cambridge Big Band, 2nd University
of London Jazz Band, 3rd Dave Gelly
Quartet (Cambridge). They are the
{acts.
These are a few personal views.
In my opinion i t i s almost impossible- to
get a f a i r result from such a contest.
Not only were there t r a d i t i o n a l ,
mainstream and modern types of jazz, but
the modern section contained a t r i o , iwo
quartets, and octet and a dectette.
The musical standard of a l l was very high
and I would have thought that they could
not have been compared without a large
amount of personal ta3te entering into
the matter. I must point out that this
i s not a personal bias brought about by
the f a c t that the Jazz Gardeners werei
not i n the f i r s t three. The Gardeners
gave an absolutely f a u l t l e s s performance,
marked by, complete relaxation and perfect
balance. I t nas been said that t h e i r
stage presentation was probably the best
of the evening and the basic inherent
swing which they attained was c e r t a i n l y
not bettered by any of the other groups.
The way i n which the whole audience
concentrated whilst the Gardeners were
playing, and the way i n which they snap-
ped into applause at the end of the set
made the t r i p w e l l worth while f o r the
three I.C. musicians.
But this i s no reason why the
Gardeners should have been placed i n the
f i r s t three. The musical standard of
the other groups was equally as high and
the only way i n which a d e f i n i t e r e s u l t
could be obtained was to l e t personal
taste decide. Which i s ^presumably'
what happened.
Had I been judging I would have
aimed at selecting a v a r i e t y of styles
(assuming the musical standard to be
s u f f i c i e n t l y high) with the accent on
o r i g i n a l i t y . I t w i l l be noted that no
t r a d i t i o n a l band has got throughrfrom
this semi-final. I consider thi3 wrong.
In his remarks Benny Green dismissed a l l
the t r a d i t i o n a l bands by saying that a
banjo cannot make up f o r a piano. What
he should have said was that i t was his
own personal narrow minded view that a
banjo cannot make up f o r a piano. A l l
the t r a d i t i o n a l bands had banjos and no
pianos. None of them got through.
Enough said?
The placing of the Cambridge Big
Band wa3 a big mistake i n my opinion.
The band had good musicians (though many
were not jazz s o l o i s t s ) and indeed the
tenor player was the best on t n i s i n s t r u -
ment in the contest. But t h e i r arrang-
ements were exact copies (phrase f o r
phrase, note f o r note, instrument f o r
instrument) of arrangements by G i l Evans
and Marty Paioh. They featured a
bearable v o c a l i s t who sang note f o r note
l i k e Mel forme whilst the band played
the Marty Paich arrangement note f o r not
This was the rock bottom i n o r i g i n a l i t y .
The sound achieved by the band couldn't
help but sound pleasant but i t tended to
be stodgy and the rbyfcibm team dragged.
Giving f i r s t place to this "dance band"
was a gross error by the judges.
The University of London jazz band
was without a doubt the best of the even-
ing. This octet, b u i l t around a nueleus
of the U.C. band, featured a flugel-horn
player of quite amazing c a p a b i l i t i e s .
Obviously the band was built^ around him
and he was a great inspiration, t o the
other musicians. But every member of
the band was a very competent s o l o i s t .
The rhythm team produced a good drivo
and the clever punchy arrangements gave
the band a d r i v i n g , f r e s h and o r i g i n a l
sound. But they had to be content with
second place - l e t us hope that this i s
changed i n the f i n a l .
The Dave Gelly quartet deserved a
place i n the f i r s t three, f o r Gelly blew
a nice alto and the rhythm section were
competent*I; But I couldn't help think--
ihg that these a l t o - l e d quartets are
getting f a r too numerous and f a r too
Stereotyped.
The I.C. t r a d i t i o n a l band under
Ken Gibson's leaaership tpoÂ»t some time
to warm up and there were f a r too many
f l u f f e d notes i n the f i r s t two numbers.
But when they s e t t l e d down they played
w e l l . Unfortunately, l i k e the other
trad bands, they f e l l victims to Benny
Green1

Anyone who has read the jazz column
i n the Observer w i l l have guessed that
Benny Green gave us an amusing time when
he commented on the bands. Unfortunat-
ely I haven't space to relate a l l of his
comments, but t y p i c a l was his comment on
the Jazz Gardeners. he accus d them of
not playing the correct tune of "But not
for me" (a completely i r r e l e v a n t f a c t ) ,
made some pathetic remark about Gershwin
turning i n his grave, and suggested that
the Gardeners bought the 3heet music.
This was greeted with a chorus of cat-
c a l l s , boos and other pleasant exclama-s
tions from every corner of the h a l l .
Benny Green's continual reference to him-
s e l f as a musician (he played baritone
saxophone with Lord Rockinham'3 XI)
became a l i t t l e t i r i n g to my ears at
least.
Alun Morgan was s u r p r i s i n g l y quiet
throughout the whole proceeding; i t
appeared as i f he was quite bored by the
whole thing. Let us hope he snaps out
of i t by the f i n a l or else the B r i t i s h
jazz c r i t i c s w i l l probably add to t h e i r
ever growing opposition.
May I stress that these view3 are
aimed at the inadequacy of the method of
judging as a whole; there i s no personal
bias involved at a l l . The jazz club
wouldTj-ke to thank a i l those who show
interest i n our a c t i v i t i e s and especially
those who took the t r i p to Reading.
To f i n i s h on a pleasant note I am
able to report that the I.C. -raditional
band has reached the f i n a l of the London
University jazz competition for the
Colyer Cup. The f i n a l i s at N.E^C. on
March 2nd and t i c k e t s may be obtained
from Richard Hushton.
