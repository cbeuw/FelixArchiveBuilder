The f i r s t half of the academic year
la over, and the second half has got o f f
to a good 3tart. This i s the time of
the year when sports teams reach the
senith i n their respective f i e l d s , when
work, that dreaded subject begins to grip
everyone, and F e l i x sales start the down-
ward trend*. Considering the f i r s t topic,
this year the sportsmen of I.C. have
proved beyond any shadow of doubt that
t.C. i s the foremost a t h l e t i c college i n
the University. The Rugby Club, a3 has
been reported elsewnere, had l i t t l e
B i f f i c u l t y i n winning the Gutteridge Cup,
and hopes ar-e high that the Soccer Club
and the Hockey Club w i l l complete the
hat t r i c k , a feat never before performed
i n the history of the university. But
Success has pot by-passed the minor
clubs. Swimming and basketball teams
are almost certain winners of their r e -
spective leagues, and the "men-afloat"
have kept the I.C. colours f l y i n g high.
The idea of worK needs no introduction,
and can be rapidly passed over, and we
reach the MOAN! F e l i x has been h i t this
year by two main bugs, c r i t i c s who just
talk, and petty thieves whqse a b i l i t i e s
tire becoming more and more apparent.
ITo contrast the f i r s t , the number of con-
tributors and ^ e l i x reporters has been
iouhled but there i3 l i t t l e that can be
done against the l a t t e r .

Dear S i r ,
I must protest against the a t t i -
tude taken by your paper. D :spite
your constant cajolery and threats
against the usual even tenure of my
existence, I w i l l not surrender my
brown bag, I w i l l not w i l l i n g l y remain
on the college premises after f i v e and
I w i l l not (beyond triis b r i e f e p i s t l e
contribute to F e l i x .
I think I can claim the support
of most of your readers. They, no
doubt, l i k e myself f e e l they have
contributed enough to college l i f e after
paying our union fees and our f o r t -
nightly fourpence to F e l i x . Be
content, s i r , to enjoy your position
i n the r u l i n g e l i t e of t h i s college an
do not encourage us to revolt l e s t we
overthrow you. Do not pour scorn
upon us or we s h a l l boycott your paper
and see you bankrupt, the debtors j a i l
your alma mater.
Yours sincerely,
Sleeping Dog.
Dear S i r ,
I would l i k e to use your spaoe
to thank a l l the people who gave
t h e i r time on Thursday, Feb 11 t o
man the c o l l e c t i o n boxes i n a i d of
the World Refugee Year. The f l a g
day was a part of a week's a c t i v i t y
throughout the University organised
by the University of London
United Nations Student Association.
The money i s g^ing towards the UNA
projects of the WRY. The money
collected at I.C. amounted to
£34 - 4 - 9d. and, apart from money
collected at U.L.U. and L.S.E., the
highest collected i n the University.
Not a l l the money has yet reached
the bank but the t o t a l i s expected
to reach w e l l over £300.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
P. Porgess.
Dear Sir,
We should l i k e to e.-.press our
disgust with certain Union members,
concerning t h e i r behaviour on the
evening of Saturday 13th February.
That p a r t i oilier evening the committee
room which i s l a i d aside as a ladies'
oloak-room on "hop-nights" had a
so-oalled "special" meeting held i n
i t , during which the members s w i l l e d
the room with beer and vomit.
Is i t not time some individuals
grew up and aoted l i k e men instead of
lunatics when they have had a drink?
Or i f they must drink t o a point of
intoxioation oan they not confine their
oapers t o the bar premises?
This event was not the only one
that occurred on Saturday night that
reduced I.C's name to that of mud.
A ooat, a hand-bag and an umbrella
were a l l stolen from o f f union premises.
Must we tolerate thieves amongst us,
as w e l l as i l l i t e r a t e louts who are
more f i t t e d to a zoo than a univer-
s i t y ? Many s i m i l a r incidents i n
the not too-distent past can be
r e c a l l e d (excluding the regular Satur-
day night swamp i n the gents' t o i l e t s ? ,
i n which members of the college have
demonstrated t o the public and t h e i r
associates that they are unworthy of
the name of gentlemen, and corres-
pondingly disgrace the niime of the
student body i n general.
Grow up I.C. and leave your
appies behind!
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r ,
In your issue of January 29th,
you published an a r t i c l e e n t i t l e d
"What do you think?", i n which you
attempted t o arrive at a conclusion
as to which-form-of education
(i.e. public or grammar school) best
suited an i n d i v i d u a l to university
s o c i a l l i f e . The author of t h i s
a r t i c l e came t o the conclusion that
i t was the publio schoolboy, with a l l
h i s "independence, self-confidence ani
polish", who ran the s o c i a l r a t race
more successfully than h i s more
lowly bretheren.
We would not go as f a r as to
say that a l l public schoolboys are
brash and over-confident but i t does
seem :that they are t y p i f i e d by "plum
in the mouth" accents, fancy w a i s t -
coats and umbrellas. Apart from t h i
f r a n k l y "U" s t y l e of dress and depar-
tment he has no advantage over the
grammar sohool boy, who not having
been c l o i s t e r e d i n a "monastic" way
of l i f e throughout the formative year
of h i s childhood does not have t o
exhibit himself i n such an ostentatic
When i t comes t o the c r i t e r i o n
of self-confidence and independence,
i t must be r e a l i s e d that the grammar
sohool boy has, as l i k e a,s not,
spent several summers: canoeing, oampi
or hitoh-hiking on the continent,
w h i l s t h i s opposite has r e t i r e d to h i
father's gountry residence.
As we believe in.constructive
o r i t i o i s m and abhor a l l that whioh i s
t o t a l l y destructive, we should l i k e
to state that i n our opinion, ex-
sohool boys whether public or grammar
are equal. I f however one has an
advantage over the other with regard
to entertainment value i t i s more
l i k e l y to be the ex-grammar
school boy, as i t i s odds on he's sea.
more of l i f e , though the other may ha-
experienced more d i s c i p l i n e .
However as the main topic of
conversation of both, as freshers,
seems to be what they d i d at sohool 01
where they went the previous Saturday
night, we believe that neither, u n t i l
they have " l i v e d " , can run a s o c i a l l i
•successfully. In order t o do so an
i n d i v i d u a l must have experience of l i v
ing w i t h a l l types of people and
apart from t h i s , be an entertaining an
not too exacting conversationalist.
After a l l i t i s f a r more i n t e r e s t i n g
to hear how o l d so-and-so got to
Istanbul than t o l i s t e n to a d i s s e r t -
ation oh Pott's biology master.
Perhaps one of the contributory .
factors to the more stimulating s o c i a l
l i f e of any of the Oxford or Cam-
bridge Colleges than that of I.C.
i s that both of the former, u n t i l late
only accepted post-national servioe
men. I f I.C. were only to accept
undergraduates with a year of
" l i v i n g " p r i o r to college perhaps we
would have less apathy towards our
oollege functions. I t i s food f o r
thought.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
