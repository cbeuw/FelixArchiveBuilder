I.C. won (and LOSTJ j the Gutter -
idge Cup at Motspur Park l a s t Saturday,
but t h i s was almost incidental i n a
day of many strange scenes. The large
colourful, partisan crowd was entertai-
ned by the f i n a l of the seven a side
tournament which dragged on l i k e a
Scottish dirge for f u l l y forty minutes
before Woolwich clinched the game.
Immediately afterwards the crowd
watched at fever p i t c h as Mike Ba.rron
led on the Presidents XV for a s c i n -
t i l l a t i n g display of fast open rugby.
The idea was to boost the morale of
R.V.C., so that the game might not be
too one sided; unfortunately the qual-
i t y of vigour depressed them even more.
The day w i l l long be remembered f o r a
b r i l l i a n t t r y by Rushton, running at
an angle of 45*, dummying h i s way past
every f l a g , before grounding the b a l l
to the r i g h t of the posts, despite a
l a t e tackle by his own f u l l back.
With t y p i c a l generosity, Rush dained to
take the kick himself, but since the
opposition had f l e d the team l i n e d up
to be presented to the Pretender to
the Duchy bf Gloucester (Les A l l e n )
and "Lady Dorothy" (Sue Coombs). The
ensuing ovation oontinued as I.C.,
led by captain Mike Bregazzi l i n e d up
apposite Vets, to be presented to S i r
Douglas Logan, Chancellor of the Univ-
e r s i t y . And, so to the game.
Imperial rapidly made t h e i r way
into the vets twenty f i v e , and . a
b l i n d side break by Wyn Davies only
just f a i l e d to bring a â€¢try. Continued
pressure brought reward, when a f t e r f i v e
minutes, on winning the heel the pack
splendidly c a r r i e d the b a l l over the
l i n e where i t was grounded by Otto G i l -
bert" Bregazzi's kick from the touoh-
linojjoared grandly between the uprights
and a l l hopes of a quick t r y were r e a l -
ised. Vets, were not to appreciate the
d i f f i c u l t i e s they faced and r e t a l i a t e d
p r e a c h i n g the I.C. 25. That they on-
did t h i s once more i n t h i s h a l f was
h r e a l measure of I.C. superiority.
Half time came thus with I.C. leading
by 5 pts. - 0, Bregazzi having only
aarrowiy f a i l e d w i t h a 35 yd. penalty.
Vets, helped by a following wind,
gradually came more and more into the
picture i n the second half, but through-
put, t h e i r three quarters took up p o s i t -
ions normally occupied by wing forwards
and t h e i r sole attacking idea consisted
pf the kick ahead and swift following
Up; however, fearless marking, b r i l l -
iant t a c k l i n g and f a u l t l e s s catching
v
v the I.C.+defence f o i l e d a l l t h e i r
.fforts.
The end came v i r t u a l l y early i n the
second half, when just a f t e r Vets having
f a i l e d to convert* a penalty i n front of
our posts, Ray Milward following up qui-
ckly a kick from Wyn Davies amazed a
lethargic f u l l back by h i s turn of speed
r e s i s t e d the temptation to pick up on
the run, and dribbled over the l i n e to
score i n the corner. Breg. f a i l e d to
convert, but I.C. looked comfortable
winners at t h i a stage.
Vets, continued to FIGHT,(indeed,
both Tom Banks and Dai Howell, f a l l i n g
to blows more worthy of Ingmar Johanssen
t:>an rugby players), but cool defence,
swift covering and tight play kept the
I.C. l i n e intact. Once, however, a f t e r
a rare mistake, the l i n e looked at Vets
mercy, but a b r i l l i a n t pick up on the
run,^a dazzling run, and a f a n t a s t i c
40 yd." touch by Randal Peart was a high
l i g h t of the game.
Just to emphasize t h e i r forward
supremacy 1.0. made the score 13 - 0
"With another push over t r y attributed
to John Bridges. A great cheer went, up
from the supporters as Randal Peart took
the kick, and the noise was redoubled
when he oonverted.
The f i n a l score v.a's f u l l y j u s t i f i e d
for I.C. had played cool, i n t e l l i g e n t
rugby throughout. No one person could
be singled out f o r extra praise, every-
one played t h e i r part and a l l deserve
credit f o r a great team performance.
The best kept secret was that
Gordon Margretts had broken h i s arm i n
a tackle during the opening minutes.
The* SH offer: t h e i r best wishes to the
Soccer and Hockey Clubs i n t h e i r bids
to make t h i s a t r i p l e year.

As I.C. expands, the gap which
already e x i s t s between the governing
body and the students, becomes larger.
In the past the only means of b r i d g i n g
t h i s gap have been the contacts es-
tablished between I.C. Council and the
Rector. These contacts have been
very u s e f u l i n putting forward the
Union's point of view, but t h i s i s not.
necessarily the same as that of i n d i v i -
dual students. In f a c t the only means
the Rector has of determining the opin-
ion of students i s v i a I.C. Counoil,
v i a a Union Meeting. Everybody knows
that I.C. Union meetings fire poorly
attended and that individual students
put forward t h e i r own views a l l too
r a r e l y .
To t r y to r e c t i f y t h i s p o s i t i o n
the Rector has organised an undergraduate
su, vey i n the form of an exhaustive
questionnaire. Questions range from
General Studies to Food, Hostel
Accommodation to Parking, with the l a s t
page devoted t o the Union. The idea
i s not to pry into a student's p r i v a t e
a f f a i r s but to gain information vrhich
w i l l be used i n planning future student
f a c i l i t i e s . The d e t a i l s of each
p a r t i c u l a r student's p r i v a t e l i f e w i l l
be confidential and only the s t a t i s t i -
cal analysis ' . i l l be published.
This i s your chance to help the
future students of I.C. and I hope that
a l l of you w i l l take i t . The question-
naire w i l l appear i n the College l e t t e r -
racks on Monday Feb 29th and the
closing d-.te w i l l be March ?th.
