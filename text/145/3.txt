As a p u b l i c i t y stunt f o r world
Refugee Tear and also i n order to break
the existing record, i t has been suggested
that Imperial College organises a TWENTI-
FOUR HOUR, EGG AND SPOON RACE, ROUND THE
CIRCLE.
This to the best of our knowledge
has never been done before!
The idea behind the sheer glorious
idiocy of such a scheme i s to t r y to
interest the Hewspapere, Television and
the London public and so gain wide pub-
l i c i t y f o r the 'Aorld Refugee Tear
Carnival.
I t i s hoped that support f o r the
pace w i l l spread throughout the
University of London as a whole.
Already f i v e teams of twenty members each
have been formed from Guilds with the
promise of at least two more. Canvassers
are now actively engagediin whipping up
support i n R.C.S. and Mines. I.C.W.A.
has promised a team and altogether we
hope to make this the biggest organised
student p u b l i c i t y shambles seen i n the
London streets, this century.
Teams of twenty w i l l run relays
round a route approximating t o the
o i e e x l r l i n e . That i s on the surface,
on foot, between stations. * No one mem-
ber of a team w i l l be on h i s (or her)
feet'for- moire, than one and a h a l f hours.
A prorisionai route has been sorted
out and legal-enquiries are pending.
Wall t h i s i s the punoh l i n e , people
are wanted to take part, runners, people
with oars as route marshals, anybody who
has tre correot reactions when coughing
w i l l be considered physically and menta-
l l y f i t to participate..
Rest assured that no hardships w i l l
be encountered along the route since i t
has been suggested that a l l check points
w i l l be either public houses or coffee
bars and when they close cars suitably
stacked with a l l the necessary comforts
so dear to the student's heart.
So t h i s i s an appeal to i d i o t s i n
the name of sanity. A l l you frustrated
p r a c t i c a l jokers who complain that t h i s
College i s dead, a l l you lazy i d l e tea
s w i l l e r s who moan about apathy and do
nothing about i t - here's your chance.
This i s also an appeal to the sen-
s i b l e l e v e l headed types who think that
t h i s idea and a l l i t s originators are
nuts. tie want to publioise World
Refugee year , and besiue the sanity of
trying to help homeless, half-starved r
refugees, however i n d i r e c t l y , the i n -
sanity of this race idea seems harmless
enough. - Besides, you may be grand-
fathers one of these days.
The best way to r e l i e v e people*of
t h e i r money without l e g i s l a t i o n i s to
make them laugh.
So anybody who's either mad enough
or moral enough to support this idea, or
anybody with ideas, suggestion etc: get
in touch with

The country (we are told) i s
clamouring f o r more s c i e n t i s t s and
technologists, men (and women) with
three years of somnd^raining behind
them, ready to take t h e i r places i n i n -
dustry. Three which have transformed
them from selfconscious school children
into capable, qualified adults. Three
short years' have done this; and i t
might be interesting to watch the-dev-
elopement of such, a miraculous process.
The operation begins on the f i r s *
day at University. Fresh firom school,
the raw youth's i l l u s i o n s of University
l i f e are exploded by the shabby 2nd and
3rd year students, the cramped lecture
room, and the chalk covered gentleman
on the platform at the front - Dirk
Bogarde never had i t l i k e this! On top
of a l l this disappointment, the chalk
man succeed i n breaking our recruit's
heart completely by announcing that he
i s expected to work l i k e a nigger f o r
the next three years,
Outside College hours the picture
i s brighter. He gets used to not
having to s i t i n the t o i l e t to smoke a
cigarette, and away from the parental
eye what does i t matter i f he gets drunk
every night? Besides, l i v i n g with Mum
doesn't give a chap anywhere to l i v e his
»ex l i f e . Soon he re-learns the coarse
songs he sang as a f i f t e e n yearold and,
from a place in)(the orowd everything
looks rosy again.
With progress to the 2nd year comes
a more responsible outlook. No more
doe3 he help seven others to remove the
trousers from a struggling r i v a l . I t
i s now his job to i n c i t e freshers to
such deeds. Strong advice from p o l i t i c
Union o f f i c i a l s urges him to take part
in Union administration i n preparation
for executive positions i n his t h i r d
year.
•On the academic side the work p i l e s
up, but now nor specimen i s used to
being snowed under with problem sheetsi
So comes the last year at College.
Of course no o f f i c i a l position i s reached
by our t y p i c a l student. This promise
was merely a carrot dangled before his
nose by a shrewd buck-passer. The
prospect of having to 3tand on his own
feet seems f r i g h t e n i n g l y near. Maybe
greater application to the job i n hand
over the l a s t couple of years would have
f i t t e d the candidate better f o r the task
ofholding down a responsible job. ,0r
perhaps wider p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n s o c i a l or
p o l i t i c a l a f f a i r s would have been chara-
c t e r developing.
And at the end of the road he
begins to wonder, much as he did at the
beginning, '"What next?"

in t h i s issue, a l e t t e r
from a gentleman who call*,
himself "Sleeping Dog",
attempts t o defend the
action of Brown bag-
gers i n taking no part
, in_College s o c i a l l i f e .
THis gentleman i s l i n -
ing, i f l i v i n g i s a
term which can be app-
l i e d t o him, i n a fool's
paradise. Having con-
tributed h i s Union fees,
which are paid by the
people who pay his grant
and not by him, he f e e l s
that i f he pays fourpence
far h i s f o r t n i g h t l y
F e l i x , which the major-
i t y o f h i s brethren of
the nine to f i v e f r a t -
ernity, never do, then
he has done h i d s t i n t
to the running of the
Union..
I t matters not at a l l
[to him that without th<i
(Union,. t h i s college
iwould be a technical
school, that h i s con-
freres vfould eat t h e i r
sandwiches i n lecture
[rooms while they d i d
Jtheir problems, and he
would leave t h i s college i n the
same i n f a n t i l e state i n which he
entered i t . I n fact he would
revel i n h i s ignorance.
His ideal would appear t o
be the narrowest possible e x i s t -
ence w i t h i n the l i m i t s of h i s
academic career. .He i s not moved
by any l o y a l t y t o I.C. He n e i t h -
er knows about nor cares about
what goes on around him. His
only claim t o fame i s a sneering
l i t t l e l e t t e r t o F e l i x , whioh he
has not got the guts to sign.
He i s shalltor and i n f a n t i l e
and, he says, he w i l l lead the
brown/baggers to the barricades
and overthrow the Union. I t i s
my personal opinion that t h i s
l e t t e r v/as composed under the i n -
fluence of a h a l f pint of cider
ordered i n a moment of
weakness and drunk
an hour of e f f o r t
Mr.Sleeping Dog
S i r , i f you have
nothing better
to say, then;I
suggest you get
back to your c a l
cuius and f i n i s h
up leading a
t h i r d rate l i f e
i n a fourth rate
