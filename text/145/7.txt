I.C.W.A. entered the U.i.U. Fashion
Show this year. The regional semi-final
was held on February, 17th at Goldsmith's
College, New Cross. The I.C. entry was
organised by Miss Wallace. Eight coll
oolleges took part, each having 5 models
to illustrate the theme "Student Fashion"*.
Monsieur de Barrone made a most, engaging
compere, in spite of comments from fellow
basketball players i n the audience.
He f i r s t introduced Kristine Bragiel
who wore a blue angora winter coat, over
a grey mohair slim skirt and white sweater*
Next came Joan Kingston, showing red
oorduroy slacks, with a blue paisley over
blouse, as casual wear. Sheenagh Wallace
wore a more formal green jersey costume.
Judy bright was dressed i n a blue figured
nylon evening dress, which was enthusias-
tically received. Brenda Taplin brought
the show to a close, appearing i n a
quilted cherry coloured housecoat, over
a pink baby-doll nightdress. At this
point the compere wished the assembled
company goodnight and sauntered off, arm
i n arm with the last model.
Goldsmith's team oertainly deserved
their- win. No other placing* were ofiven
given, But I.C. showed up extremely well
against stiff opposition, ana are to be
congratulated upon their- poise, and
professional appearance. They managed
to look remarkably relaxed in front of
a critical audience, and seemed undestu-
rbed by unpredictable noises of audienoe
appreciation.

February 29th to March 7th

I.C.G.C. has had a very eventful
period since the last account of i t s
activities. The Ee.gle, •« nigH per-
formance two seater, arrived just in
time for freshers day, and i t was seen
rigged in Prince Consort Road by many
peaple.
Changes at Lasham, where we have
been operating, have made training
there prohibitively expensive, although
flying is s t i l l possible. While hoping
for an alternative site, we spent twa
enjoyable week-ends at Oxford before
Christmasj but we have now moved to
Redhill where training i s by aerbtow'
in the Eagle. Intensive flying in an
attempt to erase the back-log of last
term i s now taking place.

TesJ t h i s i s the present happy
state ©f the oluL'a record. A f t e r
l o s i n g 3 matohes r i g h t at the beginning
of the season an unbeaten record had
been maintained u n t i l a week ago when
the f i r s t team l o s t t o Cambridge
Cockerels by 6 rubbers t o 1. ' This
r e s u l t would probably have stood a t
6 - 3 had not one of our players
been unfortunate enough t o eat
Chinese food p r i o r t o the match; he
d i d however spend a very pleasant
afaaraoon with the nursing s t a f f at
Cambridge Hospital, since whioh time,
I am very glad t o say, he has made a
r a p i d and complete reoovery.
To go through the matches i n
chronological order and give d e t a i l s
would be rather uninteresting but the
second team's v i c t o r y over the formid-
able U.C. team must be mentioned. A
splendid f i g h t by everyone concerned
put the second team w e l l i n the running
f o r top of the league.
Success too i s the byword of the
mixed team's progress and u n o f f i c i a l
reports maintain that i t shares the
exalted p o s i t i o n of league leaders w i t h
U.O. and L.S.E.
The f i r s t team have finished t h e i r
league commitments and will'probably
f i n i s h second i n t h e i r d i v i s i o n ,
although there i s a chance of champion-
ship honours.
However, the season's a c t i v i t i e s
are not drawing t o a close w i t h the
end of league matches i n sight.
There remain away f i x t u r e s with Oxford
Woodpeckers, Southampton and Reading,
THE CLUB TOURNAMENT ON MARCH 2nd and
5th at Nine Elms Baths, and several
other f r i e n d l y f i x t u r e s .
Hopes f o r a portable court f o r
use i n the cencert h a l l are at present
high although the matter i s s t i l l
under consideration b the student
finance committee. I f the necessary
jrant is' forthcoming, f a c i l i t i e s next
season should be much improved and the
olub w i l l be able t o cater f o r a great-
er number of members.
L a s t l y , a mention of the annual
dinner and theatre outing. This,
held on 15th Jan, was very w e l l
supported and Mr. Mooney served an
enjoyable dinner t o 44 club members
and guests. A s u r p r i s i n g l y unevent-
f u l 'bus t r i p to the Host End's L y r i c
Theatre heralded a very entertaining
show and revealed t o a l l , t h e d e l i g h t -
f u l laught of our Hon. Secretary
(many suggestions have since been put
forward as t o i t s l i s t description!).
As searing from Redhill would be
very restricted owing to the proximity
«f the Gatwiok Control Zone (visions of
gliders and jets on the approach simul-
taneously) we propose to return to
Lasham after Easter. W
e hope the
possibility of our members giving up
gliding for power flying with the Tiger
Club at Redhill i s remote!
^iven a reasonable summer, this
should be a vintage year for soaring.
Phoenix, our Skylark II, is now being
restored after f i r e service last year
Writ Rote* Tails and David Ashford will
be flying her m the National Soaring
Week in August.
The Eagle will afford opporturiitiel
for advanced instruction in cloud and
oross-oountry flying, which ha3 been, d
neoessity, neglected in the past and
undoubtedly this will result in muoh
more efficient solo flvina.
The I.C.G.A. has started the new
decade w e l l ; two cancellations by
our opponents, and one win. On the
10th we beat St. Mary's Hospital by
4 matches t o 1, at Hi^hgate. Here
are the i n d i v i d u a l r e s u l t s :
Brian Leadsom l o s t t o Rodney Tate,
1 hole
Norman Loch beat John H a l l , 1 hole,
a f t e r being 4 down with only 6 t o play.
Hugh-Godfrey beat Peter Tweadale,
5 and 4-
Michael Rycroft beat George Vaughan,
6 and 5
John Street beat George Vaugan, 5 & 3

I.C. Add t o Trophy C o l l e c t i o n
On Wednesday 10th February a
strong Imperial College team oarried
off the trophy awarded by the South
West Essex Teohnioal College i n t h e i r
annual four and a h a l f mile race
through Epping Forest and back
streets of Walthamstew. The second
team was narrowly beaten by Borough
Road Training College who no?/ possess
a strong team while the weaker I.C.
t h i r d and fourth teams came n i n t h
and f i f t e e n t h respectively.
Consistent running by John C o l l i n s
gained him second p o s i t i o n and he was
closely followed by John Cleator and
Jim Bernard. Of the remaining f i r s t
team runners John Conway was 7th,
Mike Barber 8th and Tony Larkum 12th.
A welcome return was that of Alan
Hooker a f t e r a b r i e f retirement.
The Metropolitan P o l i c e were w e l l
and t r u l y beaten on Saturday, February
13th at Petersham by a mixed team.
Even a f t e r leading a w i l d goose chase
John Cleator managed t o win but only
by a narrow margin. S i x of the next
eight positions were occupied by
I.C. runners, followed by a motley
crew of'seven'-policemen. Bob Baldey
and Alan B^rown were t o be seen l o i t e r -
ing a t the back, with dubious intentions,
no doubt, t o embezzle points f o r
the Petersham Pot.
A t r i a l , held t o help select the
team f o r the Hyde Park Road Relay, on
the fallowing Wednesday produced some
very good r e s u l t s and i t appeal's that
the I.C. team w i l l be w e l l i n the fore
on the great day. On the same a f t e r -
noon a three man "A" team defeated a
s i m i l a r l y small team from '3.11.0. by
9 pts. to 14. A three man "B" team
t a i l e d along behind w i t h 23 p t s .
AtParliament H i l l F i e l d s on
Saturday 20th February a second tjaro
was beaten by the Vale of Aylebury
A.C. b y only two points; the Lloyd's
Bank A.C. f i n i s h i n g t h i r d * John
Conway held second p o s i t i o n throughout
muoh 6f the race and Pete Warren ran
s t e a d i l y to f i n i s h fourth.
