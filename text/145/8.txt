On Sunday, 7th February,
Graham Taylor won the U;iiversity of
London "Appoint, •wtesrcup. He d i d
so after only 6 of the 8 races had
been run but his lead was so decisive
that the series w,as conceded to him.
Well done
Other members of the club have
also been doing very w e l l i n the Points
racing. David Pentz, a f i r s t year
J i l Tech. student, h-s sailed consis-
tently well to place one of the College
boats f i r s t i n the "B" points ssries
and he i s now working hard to improve
the placing of t h i s boat i n the "A".
It now seems probablv that the 1st and
End.boats i n the "B" series w i l l be from
I.C., thus carrying o f f the double.
On Saturday 6th February I.C. 2nd
team went to s a i l at Heading on a
flooded Thames. The match was very
interesting with strong currents and
l i g h t winds. I t was a change to s a i l
hard through the water yet s t i l l water
the land going the other way!
Towards the end of the race the
down stream bouy broke loose and David
Pentz was l a s t seen chasing i t down-
stream i n a desperate attempt to round
i t . I t i s rumoured that David,
unable to s a i l against the current,
returned to London by F i r e f l y but Read-
ing University don't seem to have l o s t
one of their boats. I.C. l o s t
29 pts to Readings 42^.
On Saturday and Sunday the 5th and
6th March I.C. S a i l i n g Club has entered
two teams i n the : inter-collegiate.,
team match f o r the Castaways Cup.
Opinions vary but the general census
of opinion i s that I.C. have t h e i r
best chance ever of winning t h i s event,
The next issue of F e l i x should t e l l
us the result.

•.•una, i i i , i ng one or n i s regular
v i s i t * , to the Royal Lymington Yacht
Club, won the Christmas open F i r e f l y meet-
ing l a s t vaoation.
Against very strong opposition he
carried away h i s 3rd pot from Lymington
a f t e r s a i l i n g the series i n howling gales.
He must be especially congratulated
far beating the Jardine twins into 2nd
place; Adrian Jardine i s an Olympio
probable for the British dinghy team.
Since t h e i r resounding defeat
of U.C. i n the U.L, Cup semi-final
replay, the 1st XI have been extreme-
l y inconsistent. In league games
they appear to be too keen and play
with tremendous s p i r i t . Witness t h e i r
6-2 trouncing of Mannheijn University
after being 2-1 down at half-time
and very good 3-2 defeat over Christ
College, Cambridge who included two
England Amateur Internationals i n
t h e i r side as w e l l as several blues.
In a league game with Chelsea
Poly, 1,8. allowed t h i s very moderate
side ijo draw 4-4 with them and thus
take 3 points o f f them i n the league
championship whioh they do not deserve
and which I.C. can i l l afford.
•Having defeated U.C. i n the cup,
I.C. approached the league game with
the same opponents too casually and
were soon i n arrearo. I t was not
u n t i l the l a t t e r stages of the game
that I.C. woke up and played football
worthy of them, by which time i t was
too la1;e and they eventually l o s t
2-1.
The 2nd XI, a f t e r leading t h e i r
d i v i s i o n f o r much of the season have
i n recent times been slipping and
a f t e r t h e i r 3-6 defeat at the hands
of a stron" L.S.E. 2nd XI have slipped
to t h i r d place.
The 3rd XI, which f o r much of the
season have been bottom of the same
d i v i s i o n made a supreme e f f o r t and
defeated both C.E.M. and Woplwieh
Polv i n c r i t i c a l l e igue games. How-
ever the oliaax was reached against
U.C. when the 3rd XI excelled thsTn-
selves and won 1-0 on a very heavy
snow covered p i t c h although they had
only 9 f i t men. A rapid deterior-
ation has set i n 3ince and fu thar
league games have been lost 2-0 and
10-1 (the l a t t e r due to the aooence a?
t h e i r captain and the centre-half
for the day!!!). Their relegation
prospects are again unfortunately
ominous.
The 4th XI, have now completed
t h e i r league programme and are at
present l y i n g 2nd i n the d i v i s i o n .
However t h e i r ohances of promotion are
very slim as several teams have s t i l l
games to play.
The results of the 5th and 6th XI
games have been l o s t i n the chaos
caused by half-session exams. There
have been rumours, however, that some
of these have been deliberately l o s t
and that the opponents cf these teams
have been regularly celebrating double
figures. However the P. Buvies
"Sport" XI has been functioning
regularly and has recorded i t 3 f i r s t
win of the term. They defeated a
representative Rugby XI or XV (.not
d e f i n i t e l y known which) 10-0 and
thus maintained t h e i r record of being
always involved i n a match i n waioh
double figures have been scored.
(Arnott i n goal, f o r the f i r s t time
a f t e r a game d i d not complain of back
strain!)
The Club w-uld also l i k e to take
the opportunity of congratulating the
Rugby Club on winning the U.L. Cup
and hope that some of the supporters
who helped them win i t w i l l also
support the soccer club i n t h e i r

Hyde Park Road Relay" i s to be held
i n the Park on Sat. Feb 2?th at
3.00 p.m., the start being at the
West End of Rotten Row.
A recoi-d entry of about 70 teams
(42) from Universities and Colleges
i n England and Ws les make this the'
largest relay i n the Country and
possibly the world. Each team consist
of 6 men, each of whom runs a 2^
mile c i r c u i t of Hyde Park. The record!
for t h i s l a p i s held by Martin Hyman,
who achieved a time of 12 rains 39
sees, while running f o r Southampton
University i n 1958. The course
record i s held by Liverpool University
(1958) with 81 mins 37 sees.

82 mins 41 sees., Durham were 2nd,
and Leeds were 3rd with I.C. 6th, U.C.
l i t h and Kings 13th. Selwyn, Cambridge

students, to f i n i s h .
The entry includes 16 Colleges
from London, 14 from Oxford, 13 from
Cambridge, 2 from Wales and 26 others.
Oh t h i s year's form i t seems that
Loughborough may w e l l win, though
Durham, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds
and I.C. should be close behind. Of
the London Colleges, I.C. should dp
w e l i , never having been below 6th and
having beaten most opposition t h i s
season, U.C. should be w e l l up, and
judging by the r e s u l t s of the S.W.E.T.C.
Trophy Race, Borough Road may cause some
surprise. Selwyn and St. Catharines',
Oxford, are favourites f o r the I.C.
Union Cup, 1jhe l a t t e r having the
famed " a l l - b l u e team".
Many w e l l known athletes are to
compete, including several i n t e r -
nationals, and times should be very
fast. These include Steve James, the
runner of l a s t year's fastest lap
(12m. 52 sec); A.A.A.* 3 miles winner
Bruce Tulloh (Selwyn); ex U.L. Inter-
national Kevin G i l l i g a n (Wadhara);
