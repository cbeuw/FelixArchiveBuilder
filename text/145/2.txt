The English translationof Fran-
coise Sagan's l a t e s t naval has juct
been published.
I t ' s t i t l e APMEZ-VOUX BRAHMS?
gives l i t t l e i n d i c a t i o n of i t s
oontents. Needless to say, the author
has stuck t o her usual theme, of that
much overworked eternal interminable
t r i a n g l e on which 30 many n o v e l i s t s
*ely. The book i s sold at the a t t -
r a c t i v e prloe of S/6d,
The story oould hardly be more
simple. A mature • a r t i s t i c woman,
Paule, verging on f o r t y has a w e l l
established l o v e r of roughly her own
age. This lover i s u n f a i t h f u l t o
her quite r e g u l a r l y with younger
damsels i n order t o boost h i s ego.
She meets a v i r i l e young lawyer,
and they gradually become entangled.
FELIX
He displaces the older man i n her
affections and so they set up i n
partnership. They both f e e l the
a f f a i r e cannot l a s t long, which proves
correct. Paule r e a l i s e s that she
must go back to her o r i g i n a l lover,
and leaves the young man i n despair.
The book closes on lover number one
telephoning Paule to t e l l her he has
a business dinner and cannot see her
that night. He's o f f again!
I f i n d the story lacks any t w i s t s
or olever situations and just goes
along i t s straight forward way allowing
one to anticipate every move that i s
made. Francolse Sagan h. a always
enjoyed an extremely high reputation,
whioh she undoubtedly deserves f o r her
f i r s t two novels, but I f e e l that here
i n this case, she i s r .ther r e l y i n g
on that reputation Instead Of the
merits of her w r i t i n g ;
I f you are an ardent fan of the
author's and enjoy her s t y l e of w r i t i n g
- she, indeed, has an unerring talent
i n w r i t i n g of her character'3 emotions
- you w i l l probably l i k e the book,
but I do not think that i t cannot be
highly commended.
A quartet of novels, THE ALEXANDR-
IAN QUARTET, has j u s t been completed
by Lawrence D u r r e l l . These four books,
JUSTINE, BALTHAZAR MOUNTOLIVS and
OLEA ( a l l at l 6 / - ) r
d e s e r v e the utmost
praise and indeed have got it'.
They make Mile. Sagan's
novel look l i k e a s c h o o l g i r l s attempt
at an essay.
The quartet i s the r e s u l t of a
very successful experiment by the
author. He has attempted to look
at the same s e r i e s of happenings i n
a l l four books from e n t i r e l y d i f f e r e n t
viewpoints. He attempts to show that
characters and s i t u a t i o n s are seen
i n quite d i f f e r e n t l i g h t s by d i f f e r -
ent people.
The four books deal with the
writers beloved c i t y of Alexandria.
The story i s woven i n an entrancing way
giving a wonderful d e s c r i p t i o n of t h i s
town of mystery and enables a reader
with no experience of Middle Eastern
c i v i l i s a t i o n to b u i l d a most colour-
f u l mental p i c t u r e of i t .
In Justine he looks back into the
pa3t and recreates the people, events
and love a f f a i r s of the story from
h i s own memory. I n Balthazar, he i s
forced to sec the same story from
Balthazar's viewpoint, which a l t e r s
h i s considerably. Mountalive i s i n
the t h i r d person and discloses an
unexpected p o l i t i c a l p l o t , while
Clea i s a sequel used to t i e up the
loose ends and f i n i s h the story
neatly.
This i3 an extremely i n t e r e s t i n g
w e l l w r i t t e n set of books by one of
our leading n o v e l i s t s which should not
be missed.

The c h i l l blast of the icy A r c t i c
wastes was soon transformed to a glow of
inner contentment as t r a v e l weary and
gold heavy-miners in search of revelry
descended on sleepy Dawson City l a s t
Friday night.
The latest ship ioad of dollar-eyed
d o l l i e s , gathered from a l l parts of
England clung to the weather beaten a A
of the fortune hunters as tne s o f t l i g h t s
,and Carnival atmosphere tooK their
effect.
The mighty t n i r s t was upon these
sons of the s o i l , and the oust i n t h e i r
throats was set tied by three hundred,
pints of free beer provided by the man-
agement. The house was drunk dry by
the time the s h e r i f f closed the bar i n
the e a r l y hours of the morning.
The excellent music makers provided
strange rhythms from many lungs as rev-
elers trod the measure around the f l o o r
and i n a back room u p s t a i r s a group
brought f o r t h strange and e z o i t i n g sounds
i n a sneak preview of a new kind of music
yet to be invented c a l l e d "ja«s".
The eskimos f e a r i n g the hi?h s p i r i t s
of the Miners returned to t h e i r i c y homes
and none Were present at the revelry.
A3 one a.m. approached people d r i f -
ted from the surrounding rooms to Black
Jake's saloon f o r the f l o o r show, The
l i g h t s that had not been shot out were
dimmed and three delectable Hiawathas
h i r e d f r m the l o c a l reserve s t a r t e d the
showv'-with one of the most amusing and
entertaining sketches yet seen. The
f a c t that Trevorina Scarratt had been
shot with an arrow w h i l s t bending over
the cooking pot seemed to cause her no
discomfort. ' I t i s said that she had
some d i f f i c u l t y i n explaining away the
red war paint, which she could not re-
move, at an interview the next morning.
Andalusia w
r a n k l i n and Michaela
Mathews, who introduced some f o r e i g n
dish c a l l e d "crabs" completed the
excellent t r i o .
Smooth Master of Ceremonies, John
Egan, s p e c i a l l y imported from Chicago,
then introduced a scene f a m i l i a r to a l l ;
the fight f o r a woman's hand using the
lead law of the Weat. The bullet3 ana
bodies were f a s t and furious, and i t i s
presumed that Black Jake Goodman should
have been shot by hero Bob Baird f o r the
hand of fhe only female miner i n the
area, Carolyn Russell. However his gun
was rusty.
Koboay knows where the chorus l i n e
for. the next act came from although i t
i s rumoured that one of the members,
seen occasionally poking his head between
the arms of the others, was onoe the
secretary of some mininc college i n
England. Someone tripped everyone fel^.,
f l o u r bags flew, anu i t was a h e l l of a
mes3; but great fun. As the c u r t a i n
f e l l the audience j u s t i f i a b l y applauded
t* r d worK that had gone into the
t —.at.
The band continued playing u n t i l
3a.m. when the new type of music took
over and continued u n t i l the f i r s t rays
of the A r c t i c sun peeped over the i c y
rim of the horizon. The gold dust
spent, the miners h i t the t r a i l f o r the
Worth, after-an'exhausting night, thank-
ing and congratulating s h e r i f f Tom King
f o r a l l his hard work*
Once again Lawson C i t y slept.
