Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
has announced an increase of £54
million in funds for colleges and
polytechnics in 1987/88. This brings
total funding for these areas of
tertiary education to £715 million,
and represents an increase of 8% on
the figure for 1986/87, far exceeding
most expectations.
Mr Baker set out the proposals in
a letter to Mr George Walden,
Chairman of the National Advisory
Body for Public Sector Higher
Education. Of the £54 million
increase, £39 million will be added
directly to the total available for the
public sector of higher education,
and £15 million will be 'applied
selectively' by Mr Baker in areas
like science and technology and
'applied research of value to
industry'.
In his letter, Mr Baker described
his proposal as 'generous' and said
that he was sure it was a good
investment. He commended
particularly the polytechnics,
quoting an increase in 'full-time
equivalent numbers' of 45%, and a
reduced unit cost of 18%.
The surprise announcement
comes after the National Advisory
Body had proposed drastic
reductions in the number of
students admitted to colleges and
polytechnics, anticipating that cuts
would be essential. The basic
increase is still less than that
demanded by the NAB to maintain
student numbers at the current
level, but when the £15 million for
'special schemes' is included, the
sum on offer is greater than that
claimed.
Mr Baker stressed his
committment to maintain access to
higher education and said that the
money he was making available
should allow for expansion at
polytechnics and colleges of higher
education. Though impressed with
the overall record of the public
sector, he added that not all
institutions were performing to this
level, and lend particular emphasis
on the staff-student ratio.

The production of the first term-
time issues of FELIX may be
disrupted owing to delay in
conversion work on the new Print
Unit offices. The offices were due to
have been finished by August 31,
ready for FELIX to move early in
September, but there is still a
substantial amount of building and
decorating to be completed. The
contractors, W H Fearman Ltd,
were held up at the beginning of the
project through having a lot of
clearing out to do before
conversion work could proceed.
There have also been difficulties
coordinating work done by
subcontractors. At present the
expected completion date is
Monday September 15. This is only
two weeks before the beginning of
term, when Freshers' FELIX,
always an outsized edition, is due to
be produced. Chief Engineer David
Evans of the Estates Section is
supervising the conversion work
and trying to keep the contractors
to as tight a schedule as possible.
Fearmans' are working until late in
the evening and at weekends in an
effort to get the offices finished as
rapidly as possible.
The new FELIX Office
Silberston
Appointed
To Court

of the Department of Social and
Economic Studies, has been
appointed as a member of the
Restrictive Practises Court as from
August 1st 1986. He will hold the

considers cases for the Director
General of Fair Trading,
investigating incidents of restrictive

always made up of three members,

role it is to adjudicate on matters of
law. On non legal matters the three
members of the court have an equal
say.

to retire in one year's time, is
hoping not to have to give too much
time to' the Court prior to
relinquishing his part at IC.
