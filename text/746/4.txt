MONA LISA * • * •
This is a superb tale of an ex-con
and his new job as driver for 'a tall,
thin, black tart' and their
developing relationship.
Bob Hoskins is once again
incredible, from the opening
sequence he is the man who knows
nothing, constantly bewildered by
the behaviour of others. Director
Neil Jordan has written and
directed a brilliant film with
excellent control of both the
central characters. (He could teach
the director of Aliens thing or two).
Go and see it and take everyone
you know. This is probably the best
film of the year.
HANNAH AND HER SISTERS
Hannah, Mia Farrow, the oldest of
three sisters, is a successful actress
and mother whose stability is
tested when her husband, played
by Michael Caine, starts pursuing
an affair with her youngest sister,
Barbara Hershey. The middle
sister is a neurotic.
Woody Allen's film explores the
relationships between these,
women and their men in a
Chechovian manner. Once again
Allen shows his skill in balancing
both the comic and the serious in
this wonderful film. The only
possible complaint could be in his
implicit assumption that women
require men to be fulfilled.
ROSA LUXEMBERG • * •
R o s a L u x e m b e r g w a s a
Polish/German revolutionary
cruelly murdered in 1919 by an
unofficial military force.
This film is a brave attempt by
Margarethe Von Trotta to tell the
story of both her political and
personal battles and whilst largely
successful it is an awful lot to cover
in 2 hours and the pace does waver
at times so that some sections are
lengthy a n d others bairely
comprehensible in brevity.
UNDER THE CHERRY MOON
Prince plays an American gigolo
trying to pick up a rich woman in
the South of France.
Although a bit of a ham,
particularly when it comes to
pouting, Prince is pretty cute and
he not only wrote the music, and
showed excellent timing in using it,
but directed also. He has some
excellent support from his
entertaining friend, Jerome
Benton, and the ubiquitous bad
guy, Steven Berkoff, as well as a
very attractive leading lady who
plays the drums. A good film.
TARGET
When his mother is kidnapped
whilst on a holiday in Europe Chris
Lloyd suddenly discovers that his
father is not merely a boring
businessman, but actually an ex-
CIA agent.
Freudian fantasies are fulfilled as
Arthur Penn raises this standard
spy story above the level of the
ordinary by the addition of the
family plot. He has also made an
excellent choice of actors in Matt
Dillon as Chris Lloyd and Gene
Hackman as his father.
THE COLOR PURPLE
Steven Spielberg's adaptation o f . H
Alice Walker's brilliant novel about
being 'pore, female, ugly and black'
in the American South.
Spielberg's portrayal of Celie, i i
the central character turns her into
a n o t h e r E T . A l t h o u g h a
consummate filmmaker he doesn't
always seem to know just how
much his audience will go along;,*.'
with him, and those who have read l i
the book will find plenty of flaws -
inparticular the appalling ending.
However, people who haven't read^
the book may think the film is;
wonderful; and you can always
have fun watching the clever-cleverl ^pp*
editing.
