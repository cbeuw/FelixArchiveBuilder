FELIX, Friday September 5th 1986
r
Capital Ideas has
been cremated and
Down & Out in
London has risen
phoenix-like from
the ashes to con-
tinue its good work
promoting the arty-
farty.
T o d a y I decided
life was worth living
after all. A t least
for the next month
anyway. T o m o r r o w
sees L o n d o n ' s best
FREE fireworks
display over the
banks of the
River T h a m e s
starting at
8.30pm. It's
part of T h a m e s d a y
which has been
rescued from
the demise of
,. the G L C by
1
the S o u t h
B a n k B o a r d
and retains
j? the aerobatics,
^ craft stalls,
barge races
(j- and power boats
^ in the true
« T h a m e s d a y
tradition.
O n the river banks
you'll find all
manner of enter-
, tainments: brass
bands, jazz ensembles
and rock artistes
| F with T h e G r o o v e r s
p S t e e l O r c h e s t r a , t h e

till 10.30pm and is centred
a r o u n d the South Bank
b e t w e e n Waterloo and
Westminster Bridges, nearest
t u b e s are Waterloo a n d
Westminster.
' h y is it that all the good
events are happening on the
same day? A n o t h e r FREE

m u s i c o n the C o m m o n
w h i c h (surprise, surprise)
takes place o n C l a p h a m
C o m m o n . S k a music flour-
ished in the 1960s and enjoyed
a revival in the 1970s when
T w o T o n e brought out ska-
style records by T h e S p e c i a l s
and S e l e c t o r . Between 2 and

W h y not check out the S k a in

fireworks in the evening?
1 realised today why I gave up
commuting into College last
year when they cancelled m y
train. Something told me that
it was going to be one of those
days — or nights. F o r those of
y o u who enjoy train travel then
y o u r d a y is t h e 13th
September when N e t w o r k
S o u t h E a s t ( t h e s a m e
network that cancelled my
train) has its annual N e t w o r k
D a y . Y o u c a n travel anywhere
in the south east region for
only £4 and if you hold onto the
ticket you c a n claim £4 off of a
Network Card—for discount
travel all year. Personally I just
can't wait!
L^and of Hope and Glory....'
Once again it's L a s t N i g h t of
t h e P r o m s time at the Royal
Albert Hall. It's the best sort of
j i n g o i s m if t h a t ' s y o u r
particular kind of perversion
— all great fun. R e m e m b e r to
wear your U n i o n J a c k Y -
fronts though. The only
snag is that you have to ,
prove that you've been
to the Proms four times
already this year (so if y o u
haven't been yet you better get
going fast!) in order
to secure a ticket for that
performance. O n c e the P r o m s
have vacated the venue it's
handed over to more ' m o d e r n '
music. E v e r y t h i n g B u t T h e
G i r l play there on October
14th costing anything between
£6 a n d £8 a n d sultry S u z a n n e
V e g a on November 17th &
18th for £5-8. But the most
exciting visitor has to be
A l i s o n M o y e t on November
19th & 20th. tickets are by
post only from: Alison Moyet
Box Office, PO Box 77,
London SW4 9LS. Just slip in
£6-9 for y o u ticket plus 50p per
ticket booking fee and an SAE.
C h e q u e s should be made
payable to 'Alison Moyet Box
Office'. Is this girl shrewd or
what?
/ A n d still they keep on talking
about bringing Q u e e n back
for an Imperial gig! D o y o u
k n o w that it costs £10,000 to
hire the Royal Albert Hall for
one night? I wonder how m u c h
W e m b l e y A r e n a c o s t s .
Perhaps I should ask A J
J a r r e a u next time I see him as
he's appearing there with
G w e n G u t h r i e o n the 20th
(£10.50, £9.50, £8.50. Starts
7.30pm). Actually there are
quite a few good gigs around
L o n d o n this month. If y o u like
hip-hop don't stop music then
Hammersmith Odeon enter-
tains F u l l F o r c e , L i s a L i s a

R o x a n n e , a n d D J C h e e s e o n
26-27th September (£7.50,
£6.50, £5.50. Starts 7.30pm). I
guess that the best one to
catch is the jump-jive outfit
C h e v a l i e r B r o t h e r s a n d
L i n o & t h e Y o w C i t y
E x p e d i t i o n at Ronnie Scott's,
Frith Street o n 21st (£5/£5.50
D o o r . Starrs 8pm) or slightly
c h e a p e r at D i n g u v a / / s ,
Camden Lock tomorrow (£4).
All tickets are available from
the usual agents.
I've always thought that
L o n d o n has more than its fair
share of exhibitions. S o m e
even worth making an effort to
see. M o s t of us pass the Ismaili
Centre every day but never
bother to take a look inside. It
has an excellent gallery called
Z a m a n a within it a n d its
c u r r e n t e x h i b i t i o n i s
C e n t u r i e s of G o l d - the
coinage of medieval islam.
S h o w your U n i o n C a r d and
you'll get in for 50p. N o t your
cup of tea? W e l l , the H a y w a r d
G a l l e r y o n the South Bank
has lots of rude photography
on show in its exhibition
! Amour F o u . C a t c h it when
you visit o n T h a m e s d a y . T h e
N a t i o n a l M u s e u m of A r t &
D e s i g n (or the V & A to those
more familiar with its usual
title) has B l i t z F a s h i o n until
the 28th with a multitude of
designer Levi jackets o n show.
It's up to you to whether you
want to pay the entrance fee or
not. T h e f i n a l one that caught
my eye was the M a s o n i c
E x h i b i t i o n at Freemasons
Hall, 60 Great Queen Street.
Designed, so they tell me, to
'tell Freemasonry's story to
people w h o are not Free-
masons' — so that excludes
half of the College hierarchy.
Admission is free.
