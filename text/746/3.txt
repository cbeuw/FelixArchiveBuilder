Tower
Drill
The Queens Tower was swarming
with firemen early last month as
part of a rescue exercise organised
for members of the Kensington,
Chelsea, and Fulhamfirebrigades.
The chief aim of the drill, arranged
in coordination with the College's
Red Cross and safety units, was to
determine how difficult it would be
to rescue a visitor to the Tower if
they were injured or taken seriously
ill. The firemen experienced
considerable difficulty in getting the
'victim' down the narrowest
stairways in upper levels of the
tower, but it was later decided that a
special stretcher would be sufficient
for a successful rescue.
The fire brigade also performed a
breathing apparatus drill when
reserving two dummy bodies from
the tunnels immediately under the
Tower.
Surprise
Profits
Figures are coming in about the
performance of the Union's Sports
Shop and Snack Bar. The Sports
Shop made an unpredicted profit of
£2500 after having lost money last
year. Union Deputy President,
Jackie Peirce, puts this down to the
cutting of opening hours and the
reduction of staff to one person.
However, the Snack Bar did not
make as much money as expected
despite a turnover of £51500. Ms
Peirce said that this was because
'prices coming in were too high and
prices going out too low'. She did
not predict a great - increase in
prices, though, as she believes that
the Snack Bar is essentially meant
to provide a service to students and
not just a money-making operation
for the Union.
Spanner In The Works
Spanner, the handbook of City &
Guilds Union, will not appear on
time this year because of a
computer fault. Richard Davis, co-
Editor of Spanner, had almost
completed the Handbook using an
Apple Mackintosh Pagemaker
when a system failure resulted in
Counting The Cost
most of his work being lost. As a
result Spanner will not be ready in
time to be mailed with the ICU
Handbook. Mr Davis is aiming to
have Spanner ready for Freshers'
Week but admits this may not be
possible.
The Chemistry Basement During The Flood
The Chemistry Basement When Cleared
The flood in the basement of the
Chemistry building on July 31st
(See FELIX 745) is estimated to
have caused between £7000 and
£10000 of damage. The flood was
probably caused by a valve being
left open, but Chief Engineer,
David Evans, pointed out that this
could not be confirmed since the
estates workers and fire brigade
opened and closed a large number
of valves in attempting to control
the flooding.
The Union Executive have
discovered that the IBM PC
computeT -system which has been
purchased by the Union is
effectively useless as it stands. The
system was ordered by last year's
President, Carl Burgess, under the
guidance of Internal Services
Officer, Alan Rose, at a cost of
approximately £3000. It is intended
to handle the Union's accounts and
for wordprocessing.
The problems are twofold:
firstly, certain of the items delivered
by dealers Xitan Systems were not
those originally specified. The
keyboards for example are designed
for use with a different machine and
prevent certain keys being used.
However, the situation is made
far worse by the fact that many of
the components of the system are
incompatible or inappropriate to
the use for which they were
intended. The additional memory

units installed are not suitable for
running the popular Lotus 1-2-3
package which has also been
purchased. Additionalmemory and
ideally a co-processor are also
required. The video cards in the
machines at present prevent the use
of many of the facilities offered by
the Lotus software. Also useless is
the Epsom printer which has been
bought, not only has it arrived
without an appropriate parallel
interface but it is an obsolete model
and it is unlikely that new parts for
it can be obtained.
The Union staff are not happy
either with some of the software
The wordprocessor program is not
the best choice for those intended to
use it and no arrangements have
been made for training for the full-
time staff. While a Pascal compiler
bought at a cost of £152 apparantly
has no use apart from allowing
people to do their computing
coursework on the machine.
It is thought that "some of the
hardware can be returned to the
dealers and credited against future
purchases by College who are a
large customer for suckequipment.
Honorary Secretary, Dave
Colley, commented that the only
use to which the machine had been
put was playing tunes to people on
'hold' on the telephone.
