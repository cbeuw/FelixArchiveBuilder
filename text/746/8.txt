Princess Anne, Chancellor of the
University of London, will be visiting
Imperial College next month to
launch the 'Science for Industry'
Exhibition, in celebration of the
150th anniversary of the University
of London. Imperial will be hosting
the exhibition, which runs from
Monday October 13 to Friday
October 12 and will feature a series
of features by prominent scientists
from the University, including IC
Rector Professor Eric Ash.
The exhibition is being publicised
as 'one of the most ambitious
promotional programmes
undertaken by a British University'
and has been aimed specifically at
4th, 5th and 6th form students.
'Science for Industry' aims to
emphasise the value of work done
by the University in cooperation
with British Industry.
Seven areas of scientific research
will be featured, these being
Applied Earth Sciences,
Biomedical Engineering, Biotechn-
ology, Information Technology,
Marine Technology, Materials
Science and Pharmaceuticals. Each
section is intended to demonstrate
some of the most up to date work
being carried out in each of the
University's main science colleges.
The exhibition will be set up in
the JCR and the lectures given in
the Great Hall. Professor Ash will
be speaking on the 'Information'
Technology Revolution' on Friday
October 17.
Parsons
Wins Silver
Imperial College high jumper Geoff
Parsons won a silver medal in the
Commonwealth games at
Edinburgh last month when he
cleared a height of 2.28 m. Geoffs
performance in the European
Games in Stuttgart last week was
dissapointing however; he failed to
win a medal.
£200 For
Handbook
In a bid to "strengthen the links
between Imperial and its
neighbouring.' colleges, the Rector
lias made^vailable £200 for extra
copies of this year's ICU Handbook
to be sent to the Royal College of
Art and Royal College of Music.
This is part of Professor Ash's plan
to get students from the RCA and
RCM to use Imperial's facilities and
tiecome nfore involved in its clubs
and societies.
Stonewalled
Students of RCSU are still having
difficulty getting into their office
following the construction of a wall
as part of the conversion of the
former SAC Office into a flat. The
plans for this conversion were
shown to last year's ICU Exec who
gave their approval; it is not clear
whether the obstructing wall was
included at this time and Carl
Burgess, ex-ICU President, has
since denied that he ever saw the
plans.
RCS students currently have to
enter their office via the Southside
Halls entrance (West end) and
through the door onto the link
passage. Few students have keys to
the Halls and hence cannot gain
access.
New Club
Work is in progress on the new
Holland Club in the basement of
the Sherfield Building. The new
club is due to be opened by the
Rector on December 1st.
Bike Crash
There was a minor motorcycle
accident on campus last Friday
when a student came off his bike
after turning across a trail of oil.
The accident occurred around
4.30pm. The motorcyclist escaped
without serious injury, but some
damage was done to his motorbike
and to his clothing.
The trail of oil was left by a fork-
lift truck which was driven from
Central Stores to the Physics
department, but the driver of the
truck did not notice the leak
immediately.
Burger King
A new fast food bar will be opening
for a trial period of 4 days as of
Tuesday next week. Refectory
Manager, Rob Northey, is adopting
an initially low key approach to
advertising the service. Mr Northey
described the new food bar as a
cross between Wimpy and 7-11.

Two For
The Tower
Staffing in the Queen's Tower has
been reduced to a minimum as a
result of the small number of
visitors which the tower is
attracting. Only two students are
now working in the tower and there
are no guided tours. College
Assistant Secretary, Michael
Arthur, said yesterday that this
method of operation was the same
as that used for the Monument and
the Scott Memorial in Edinburgh.
Mr Arthur reiterated his view that
the tower would operate with a
comfortable profit next summer,
and added that it would be open
during the 'Science for Industry'
Exhibition which begins on
October 13th.
Union
Licenced
The takeover of the Union Bar was
signed and sealed on Wednesday
when Union Administrator Jen
Hardy-Smith and Dr Bob Schroter
took over as licencees.
Buried
Treasure
The excavations at Harlington have
uncovered a site of some
archealogical interest. In the area
where the subsoil has been removed
two wells have been found each
around 4m in diameter. Fragments
of pottery, dated at around 1000BC
have been recovered from the first
of these.
The site will be available for
archealogical study until the gravel
is mined in December/January.
