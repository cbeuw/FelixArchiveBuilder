SID AND NANCY • • •
The rise and fall of Sid Vicious and
Nancy Spungeon as told by the
director of the excellent 'Repo
Man', Alex Cox.
Although a little protracted
towards the end and very
unflattering of Nancy, this is
nevertheless an excellent film with
some superb performances by
Gary Oldman, as Sid. It is also a
touching love story and an
impressive anti-heroine advert.
FOOL FOR LOVE
Robert Altman maintains his'
tradition of filming small theatrical
productions in his film of Sam
Shepherd's play about the
incestuous relationship between a
brother and sister.
The acting is excellent and
Altman's control of space is
magnificent, but it is irredeemably a
play and the character of the father
who observes from the side lines
really does not work in a cinematic
context.
PRETTY IN PINK • •
Molly Ringwaid ('Breakfast Club')
plays a high school kid from a poor
background who, against the
advice of her friends, falls in love
with a rich kid. Their relationship is
understandably fraught.
This is one of the better teen
movies with some touching
performances from both Harry
Dean Stanton, as Molly's father,
and Jon Cryer as her friend Ducky.
Love will win in the end. Sniff.

OURSELVES

ALONE-Anne
NATION THAT ANOTHER

Ourselves Alone looks at the
present day realities of Ireland
through the eyes of three Catholic
women and their men. Set in
Andersontown, Belfast and Dublin,
Ourselves Alone is at times
fearfully funny, but rarely does it
provide the specific intensity or
anger associated with the issues of
Northern Ireland. Instead it deals
with the theme of antagonism
between emotional and political
feelings. In this sense Ourselves
Alone succeeds; where it fails is
when gratuitous one-sided action
takes place and where it is played
for laughs when tears might be
more appropriate.
Photographs of Bobby Sands
and others, juxtaposed with
paintings by Botticelli and Raphael
as set decoration are not meant to
be amusing. They seemed of little
relevence to the play.

LOVE OF SEVEN DOLLS-Paul
Gallico
Published by Penguin £1.75
Were it not for a casual bit of rape
Love of Seven Dolls could be
either an adult or a childrens' book.
Petite Mouche, a starving
nightclub dancer is about to throw
herself into the River Seine when a
puppet called Carrot Top on a
fairground stall befriends her.
Mouche becomes part of the act,
loving and being loved by the seven
puppets and by Golo, a Senegalese
semi-slave. Her relationship with
Michel Peyrot, the puppeteer, is
more enigmatic - he has never
loved anything, nor ever been
loved, and he rapes her to destroy
her innocence. However, since
there is a touching love scene at the
end, the implication is that Michel
loves Mouche covertly, and this is
disturbing - if any of the women
being painfully raped and battered
while you read this article were to
be told 'I'm doing this out of love for
you' 1 doubt if they would believe it.
Love is patient and kind, it is not
easily angered and it never rejoices
in evil. /
