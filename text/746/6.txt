Union Blues
AN OPINION BY HUGH STILES
It looks very much as if next year
will see the merger of Saint Mary's
Medical School into Imperial
College. The first such" change in
the College stricture since it
formed through merger around the
turn of the century. What does this
all mean in terms of the Union?
The general concensus amongst
Union Officers last year was that St
Mary's can best be accommodated
into the existing Union structure as
a fourth Constituent College Union
(CCU). This is a fine idea, however
it will not work.
Decisions in the Union are
essentially made by two bodies:
Council and Exec. The former
meets once a month in term time to
hear reports from Officers and to
consider the minutes of all the sub-
committees. Exec meets more
often and undertakes business that
cannot wait for next Council, room
bookings, discipline and similar. If
Council is inquorate then the
unfabled business defaults to Exec.
Exec is formed by the President,
Deputy President, Hon Sec, and
the Presidents of each of the
CCUs. Thus adding a fourth C C U
President would give the C C U s a
majority in the Exec. This I believe
would be unacceptable to most
Union Officers.
One way around the problem
would be to take on board a fourth
sabbatical Officer; a Deputy
President (Services). Consider
how the DP's job has expanded in
recent years. There is now
Norman's Snackbar, the Union
Bar, the Regalia cum Sport-shop
and the Bookshop (jointly
administered with the CCUs) all to
be run in addition to the DP's
original duties. Further, the
pressure on the Union administr-
ative staff (Jen and Pat) has been
increased by all the extra
documentation to process.
Goodness knows, they had plenty
to do before all this extra work.
T h e r e f o r e having another
sabbatical would mean that the
existing members of the Union
Office would be able to give their
fullest attention to their old duties
whilst the new sabbatical devoted
all his/her time to keeping the
various Union services trading
profitably. Harking back to the
earlier mention "of Council, you
may be aware that there was a good
deal of trouble last year in getting
Council quorate (it must be
quorate to commence business).
Why was this?
The real problem is that Council
is not only composed of Union
Officers; every department also
has a representative and, since
these seem to consider themselves
primarily answerable to their own
C C U , they do not bother to turn
up. To take these Dep Reps off
Council is problematic — they
represent their Departments and
their Departmental clubs. This
leads to another point. It is possible
for unprincipled C C U s to persuade
Dep Reps to turn up to Council and
vote with the C C U simply by
threatening to withold or reduce
the departmental club's grant. To
my mind the problem could be
solved by p l a c i n g all he
departmental clubs in a Major Sub
Committee (MSC). Therefore one
person would replace all the Dep
Reps on Council, thereby reducing
quorum and leading to more
business being conducted at
Council rather than defaulting to
Exec. Opportunities could then be
made, principally through C C U
channels, for Dep Reps to air their
grievances. Hence the Dep Reps
would lose nothing and in fact they
could be rendered solely
answerable to their CCUs.
Now the C C U s and MSCs have
never got on very well, especially
where finance is concerned. This is
decided primarily at Union Finance
Committee with the MSCs and the
C C U s accusing each other of not
doing enough to cut their
estimates. Every year in Council or
at UGMs we hear that the C C U s
are 'independent and autonomous
within ICU'. If this is the case then
M S C / C C U friction could be easily
reduced.
Let the C C U s go to College for
their subventions in just the same
manner that ICU has to. How could
they object? If they are not
hoodwinking U F C they have
nothing to lose. Objections on their
part would surely indicate sharp
practices somewhere in their grant
claims.
Since changes will have to be
made anyway in order to
accommodate St Mary's, the
Union should take advantage of
this golden opportunity to
streamline and simplify its
committees.
The year to come is an
unprecedented opportunity to
change the Union's structure, to
make it more responsive to the
wishes of the ordinary students, to
make the machinery of decision
making clearer and more
accessable and above all to get the
Union working once again as a unit
with no internal divisions
representing your views to College.
Please give some thought to the
ideas put forward here. The Union
cannot continue forever suffering
internal schisms and rifts. It must
evolve or die. I would rather it were
the former.
