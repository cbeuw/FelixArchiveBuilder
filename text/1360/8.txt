expectations
I tread on in the process. Stamp,
stamp. The heads I’ve stamped on,
you know. The enemies I’ve made.
Right, ok. Moving on... What
would you describe as the
proudest moment of your career?
Proudest? My God. I’d say a per-
son’s proudest moment is when
they can look back and say, “I did
that”. I think just giving up medi-
cine would be mine, yeah.
Final question for you. What do
you think of Imperial so far then?
Wonderful place isn’t it?
I like Imperial. It’s a fantastic
building. That Quad’s really good,
isn’t it? Yeah, you’ve done well to
get here so close to the action, you
know. You’ve got the Albert Hall,
you’ve got Hyde Park there, the
Serpentine Gallery. Yeah, I’d say
you’re minted.

Be proud like Harry: quit medicine
Comedian and bald primate Harry
Hill was at Imperial College re-
cently giving a tour de force with
his stand up routine. In between
tickling ribs and taking drunken
requests for autographs, Harry
caught up with stoic tv for a ques-
tion and answer session.
We’ve just seen you performing
as Harry Hill And The Caterers.
So, who exactly are ‘The
Caterers’?
Well, they’re a bunch of chefs that
I met at Knutsford services. They
were down on their luck, and they
were looking for work. And so I got
them, I trained them... No! Basical-
ly they’re a number of musicians
that I worked with in the past and
we started doing this for fun, just to
do it in the sound-check when I’m
doing the big shows. We’d just play
a few different songs. We thought;
“Hey, let’s see if we can get people
to pay for this” and so we started
doing it. Yeah, just doing it for fun,
really.
So what made you get into the
whole comedy scene?
Made me? I qualified as a doctor.
I was a bit fed up with that and
I’d always wanted to have a go [at
comedy]. I’d always written jokes
and liked comedians. Since I went
to medical school in London I went
to a lot of clubs, comedy clubs.
Which medical school in
London did you go to and what
possessed them to take you
onboard?
St. George’s Medical School in
Tooting. They’ll take anyone!
Who are your favourite comic
performers?
Well when I started going to
clubs I used to go and see
people like Jo Brand and Jack
Dee, people like that. They
were like, just kind of on the
clubs. Whereas when I was
a kid I liked Monty Python,
Spike Milligan, Eric and
Ernie; that kind of thing.
Moving on to TV Burp,
could you tell us a bit about
the next series and where it
is heading?
Well it’s returning soon.
There’s going to be a Christ-
mas Special and then
we’ve got a 13 week
run in the new year
which is the longest
run we’ve ever done.
So let’s hope there’s
enough television
for us to ridicule and
take the mickey out
of! As long as Em-
merdale’s running and churning
out cracking television, I think we
should be alright!
You’ve recently released a new
book. What’s that about then?
The book’s called “Tim The Tiny
Horse”. It’s a mix for parents and
kids that crosses the generational
gap. Oh, and it’s about a tiny horse
and his adventures.
What was your motivation for
putting pen to paper, or rather
finger to keyboard in this
technological age, and writing
the book?
I just started drawing this little
horse and I did a story and then
I thought “that’d be fun”, so I
sent it off to see if there was
any interest. And there was
a little bit of interest, so
then I had to draw the whole
blooming thing! It took me
weeks!
Obviously, without giving the
game away, what would you
say was the secret of your
success?
What success? I’m here, at
Imperial College on a
Wednesday night! Or
is it a Thursday? It
must be a Thursday,
we missed ‘Extras’.
I’m very pushy; that’s
the secret of my suc-
cess, yeah. Push, push,
push. I don’t mind who
Stoic TV’s Chris Hemmens pops the questions during a one on one interview with comedian Harry Hill.
Life at a glance
A medicine graduate, Harry
started with a radio show in
1993, and eventually moved to
Channel 4 with The Harry Hill
Show. Nowadays he is best
known as a stand up comic
and host of ITV’s TV Burp.
