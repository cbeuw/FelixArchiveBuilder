F
or some, New York is
the fashion capital of the
world. During my sum-
mer as a New Yorker, I
managed to gatecrash the
long haul departure lounge of the
international fashion jet set for the
Spring 2007 collections.
My experience at one of the big-
gest fashion emporiums on the
planet began with my first show,
Ashish N Soni at The Atelier in the
tents at Bryant Park. First of all, ar-
riving at the main tents was very
glamorous and I was delighted to
wade through the intrigued public
outside with my invitation. Inside
chandeliers hung from the ceiling
and the Olympus Fashion Week
sponsors showcase their offerings.
Ashish N Soni, an Indian designer,
embraced nature as a main theme
for its Spring/Summer 2007 col-
lection, with the sounds of ocean
serenading the models down the
catwalk. It was very tranquil and
the models cast were very demure,
with the collection based mainly on
simple whites and blacks. Overall,
the production was very calming,
which was particularly unusual for
a late Friday night show.
After a fantastic first night, my
next show was Ruffian, which took
place at the historic Tilden Man-
sion at Gramercy Park, home to the
National Arts Club. After arriving
especially early, I got to see some of
the fantastic pre-production: with

Rie Omoto and the MAC Pro Team.
As you can see from the photos I
took, the models were flawless and
the collection was exactly as one
fashionista described: ‘fresh, mod-
ern and wearable’. The American
modern collection dazzled, with vi-
brant and sumptuous colours like
butter cup yellow and baby-boy
blue, but overall the collection fo-
cused on creams and beiges with
lots of silk as well as the traditional
Ruffian ruffles. What I particularly
loved was the juxtaposition of the
beautifully old and the beautifully
modern with the 1840s setting and
the wonderful creations of Brian
Wolk and Claude Morais. If you love
your art, I definitely recommend a
visit to this national landmark.
My fabulous fashion week was
about to get even more fabulous
with tickets to Tracy Reese. I was
very excited to be going to a much
bigger show at The Promenade at
Bryant Park. Just by checking out
tracyreese.com, you can tell that
she’s had hugely successful col-
lections. The Promenade is a huge
space and the world’s press waited
at the end of the long runway. You
could tell the room was bustling
with excitement and suspense, and
the arrival of Carmen Electra defi-
nitely helped add to the energy.
The collection was based around
Latin dance, and the show opened
with Luis Bianchi and Daniela Puc-
ci whirling down the runway show-
ing their Spanish flare. The collec-
tion of 46 looks was then divided
into three sections each named
after a dance: Tango, Samba, and
Barrio, with each being introduced
by its own dance display and pieces
taken from a neutral colour palette,
with many voluptuous rather than
fitted designs.
The audience seemed delighted
by the collection with many show-
ing their approval with a standing
ovation and backstage you could
tell the crowd was overjoyed by Tra-
cy’s new designs.
And what’s even more exciting is
that meeting so many amazing peo-
ple, such as Marc Dlugoof, Pedro
Lázoro, and Stéphane Hoüy-Town-
er who took me to the opening of
the N store, a very hip boutique in
Harlem, which was show casing the
new collection of Omar Jermaine.
The newly renovated structure
was a very chic, and the party was
packed full of models and buyers
drinking champagne and raving
about the new collection, which is
really outstanding; it consists of
traditional clothes fashioned in a
very modern way. After meeting
the designer (who was immacu-
lately dressed) you can just tell that
he’s going to be hugely success-
ful. Then, after an exploration into
Korean cuisine, we headed to the
Venexiana Show at The Metropoli-
tan Pavilion on West 19th Street for
more stunning models and sensual
clothes by Kati Stern, who is based
in Venice and New York.
The Vollbracht Magic
All of the shows I have been to have
been special in their specific type
of fashion, but I just can’t get over
the Bill Blass show. Lucky enough
to obtain an invitation with the art
nouveau, inter-clasped double B
emblem gracing the cover, I was
thrilled. After being moved to fill a
second row seat in the Tent behind
Sigourney Weaver, Joan Rivers,
and Liza Minnelli, with Janet Jack-
son opposite; it dawned on me that
Bill Blass is a big deal. Admittedly,
I had never heard of this label be-
fore, apart from seeing a Bill Blass
hoarding off Times Square. When
I think of the best American dress
designer, I usually think Ralph Lau-
ren, but after the timeless yet mod-
ern elegance of Bill Blass I think I
may have changed my mind.
The day ready-to-wear collection
was defined by its simplicity, typi-
fied by a high cut pale blue sheath
dress and sandals modelled by Mor-
gane Dubled. The only consistency
in this varied section was that each
outfit featured its own distinctive
belt. What I especially loved were
the dresses presented towards the
end of the show. They were the epit-
ome of high glamour with each be-
ing totally individual. One that par-
ticularly caught my attention was a
lavender neck to toe jersey gown,
which covered almost every inch
of Julianna Imai’s skin. It was like
she floated down the runway. And
Camila Finn modelling an exquisite
embroidered gown comprising of
interwoven deep and bright reds
with multiple trails of confetti.
The models, including Freja
Beha, Hana Soukupova and Izabel
Goulart were an especially beau-
tiful selection and perfect in the
context of the show’s overall pro-
duction, which reminded me of an
Agatha Christie ‘Poirot’ novel, and
of the movie ‘Gosford Park’: very fif-
ties, with an infusion of modernity.
And of course when the time came,
an extremely impressed crowd
rose straight from their seats to
congratulate Michael Vollbracht on
his magic.
Chado Ralph Rucci
Displaying both his Spring 2007 and
Winter 2006 Haute Couture collec-
tions as the last big show of New
York Fashion Week, Ralph Rucci
furthered his engraving in the fash-
ion history books with elaborate de-
signs and ornate detailing. As the
only American to be invited to dis-
play his creations in Paris since the
forties, Rucci is arguably the most
influential American designer on
the global fashion stage.
One continuous element that
characterises Rucci’s work is
the extravagance of the looks he
produces. It is this opulence that
gained the attention of France’s
premier fashion council, the Cham-
bre Syndicale de la Haute Couture,
which invited Rucci to display his
haute couture collection in Paris.
With his success in Europe, Rucci
has once again stunned the New
York Fashion Week crowd with the
intricate detailing and sheer lav-
ishness of his outfits. What’s even
more astounding is that Rucci is
now celebrating 25 Years in fashion
design and numerous exhibits and
awards are honouring a quarter of
a century of Rucci’s creations.
The Chado 2007 Ready to Wear
Collection emphasised a current
trend by many designers to use
python skin in their pieces. How-
ever, Rucci incorporates taupe and
brown shades with the skin and all
black and all white designs, which
were supplemented by two cinna-
bar looks in a double-faced wool
crepe design. One dress in particu-
lar epitomises Rucci’s attention to
detail; the organza dress made with
ivory linen and pearl embroidery.
However, the embroidered script
caftan modelled by Ingrid Schram
and the doubled faced cashmere
costume with Japanese scholar
print of the Winter Haute Couture
collection further delighted an al-
ready exuberant audience.
However, Rucci had not yet
reached his pinnacle, as look after
look shone with luxurious fabrics
and impeccable craftsmanship
drawing continuous applause from
the audience. Velvets, chiffons and
satins with an incorporation of the
blacks and chocolates of the Ready
to Wear Collection, It was certainly
obvious that the organisers of Fash-
ion Week had left the most lavish
show to last.
