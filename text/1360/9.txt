Islamic Soc’s Save a Nation
When we look at our lives, it is per-
haps only human to feel that we
never have enough. Family, educa-
tion, opportunities are all taken for
granted, while basics such as ac-
commodation, food and health are
not even considered.
Imagine if you were an orphan.
What would your life be like then?
What you are envisaging is not even
half as tragic as a real orphan’s life.
Factor into this the ravages of
war. Your surroundings are piles
of rubble and dust, littered with
unexploded cluster bombs. Your
infrastructure is nothing more than
bombed roads, crumbling bridges,
burnt ambulances and an oil slick
on the beach. There is no electric-
ity, clean water or fuel for trans-
port. What remains of your educa-
tion is what remains of your shelled
school. Now, try and imagine what
it would be like to be an orphan in
these conditions. You can’t. And this
is the story of Lebanese orphans
and children.
During the 34-day war, the Leba-
nese nation received more than
7,000 air strikes, 2,500 naval shells,
and countless bullets. 1,183 people
have died in Lebanon, a third of
them children; 4,054 people have
been injured and 970,000 displaced.
At the cost of £1.8bn, 30,000 houses,
120 bridges, 94 roads, 25 fuel sta-
tions, 900 businesses, 5 hospitals,
and 31 “vital points”, such as air-
ports, ports, water and sewage
treatment plants, and electrical
facilities, have all been destroyed
(Source: UN).
With this background in mind
each and every year the Islamic So-
ciety runs a charity campaign, Save
a Nation, to raise money for and
awareness about desperate situ-
ations around the world and this
year has dedicated the Save a Na-
tion (SaN) campaign to the children
and orphans of Lebanon, through
the Disasters Emergency Com-
mitee (Islamic Relief charity)
Islam places a heavy emphasis on
charitable acts. Not only is charity
(Zakat in arabic) obligatory on all
Muslims, it is one of the five defin-
ing pillars of Islam, with the poor
and needy having the constitutional
right in Muslim countries to a mini-
mum of 2.5% of everyone’s wealth
(not income). The Quran says: “Es-
tablish prayer and dispense the pu-
rifying alms (zakat) and bow in wor-
ship with those who bow” (Chapter
2: Verse 43). In past years, the cam-
paign has raised over £60,000 for
Afghanistan, Sudan, Bangladesh,
Iraq, and recently for the victims
of the Pakistan earthquake. The
relief work has involved emergency
food distribution, supply of clean
water, basic sanitation, education
rehabilitation, to mention but a few.
The campaign coincides with the
holy month of Ramadhaan, a month
that involves a lot more than fasting
alone. The spirit of Ramadhaan is
one of self-control, devotion to God
and sharing one’s wealth with the
needy. Fasting helps us empathise
with those who are less fortunate.
Yet one cannot begin to feel the suf-
fering of those whose lands have
been struck by war, famine and
drought. Similarly one cannot com-
prehend the happiness a child or a
mother goes through on receipt of
the generosity of people like you.
The Save a Nation campaign was
therefore launched with the desire
to practice the great teachings of
How odd? Having graduated two
years ago – I find myself writing
once more to the old feline rag.
The Save a Nation Appeal – an
Islamic Society project has hit cam-
pus again, this year being it’s sixth.
To date it has raised some £75,000
for five countries from struggling
Sudan to earthquake hit Kashmir
last year. There is no doubt that
thousands of lives across the world
have been positively affected as a
result of the campaign. Yet, when
we started it all six years ago – I
never thought I was going to be one
of those people.
I don’t for one minute compare
my life to the cruel realities of life
in a mud and straw raquba in Dar-
fur or myself to those poor children
destined to spend a second winter
in the Himalayan mountains with
only a piece of cloth to protect
them. But neither can I deny that it
has changed my life.
My story is one of an IC graduate
who realised that perhaps there
truly was more to life and happi-
ness than money – and decided to
do something to reflect that. Don’t
get me wrong – I’m not brave – na-
ive is perhaps more the order of
the day but my life is more than full
and I am so immensely happy. The
choice I faced was one of stark con-
trast. I suppose I figured there can
be no harm in helping others and
learning more about oneself along
the way – especially when the alter-
native was to help myself, and learn
more about one.
I work for an organisation that
was founded by a medical student
22 years ago; the first donation was
20p from a young lad of seven or
eight who just wanted to make a
difference. What a world of differ-
ence they made. Two decades later,
and that greying student, Dr Hany
el-Banna mobilises thousands of
students every year. That 20p has
grown into £22 million. There is no
doubt in my mind that we, young
people can make a world of differ-
ence and yet I’m not so sure-footed
to know how. Naively again, I pro-
pose we strive hard together to cre-
ate a caring world of tolerance and
compassion rather than stand back
indifferent. You can e-mail me on
