live reviews
Album’s plague of boredom
This bizarre concept compilation, featuring legendary names, is a bit of a mixed bag
The concept behind Plague Songs
is straightforward; ten songs based
on each of the plagues of Egypt,
presented in Biblical plague order.
The picture this paints of the album
before even opening the case is a
bizarre one. A collection of singer-
songwriters singing about horrific
devastation just doesn’t feel right –
it feels too twee to do the topic any
justice.
However, the first song on the
album dispels such notions im-
mediately. Klashnekoff’s Blood is
a sinister hip hop polemic which
opens with a corruption of the
Lord’s prayer, “Our Father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
thy Kingdom is in flames”. It goes
on to describe a situation of urban
decline, referencing the war in
Iraq, gun crime and even Quentin
Tarantino.
What is barely referenced, how-
ever, is the plague of blood itself. In
fact, the first song on the album is
the least faithful to the original sto-
ry though paradoxically one of the
Three reviews in London’s big venues
This is far from the first time I’ve
managed to see The Subways this
year. However, this gig was easily
the best show I’ve ever seen them
perform.
Originally meant to play last April
the band had to reschedule after
Billy Lunn (lead vocals & guitar)
injured his throat and had to take
time out to let it heal. But now at
the end of their UK tour and having
just come from the festival circuit
there was no sign of any problem.
Supported by the up-and-coming
Dodgems (who were as usual su-
perb) and not quite to my taste but
good nevertheless, Larrikin Love.
The Subways treated us to a
perfect set of varied and extended
album tracks. Most of the time it
was hard to tell if it was Billy you
could hear or the hundred other
people around you who all knew
the words, which only added to the
night. While dropping in the odd
new song here and there (definitely
look out for the next album) and
performing a 15 minute version of
their now nearly legendary Rock
and Roll Queen, Billy still managed
to go for a extended wander around
the venue before crowd-surfing of
one of the 10 foot high balconies to
finish the set. You could tell they re-
ally wanted to finish their tour with
a bang, and surrounded by some
pretty hardcore fans they did that
and more.

W
hilst laying out
and editing this
week’s music sec-
tion,Igotthinking.
My first thoughts
were: why am I here spending time
fiddling with images at 11pm when
I should be at home, beer in hand,
watching The Daily Show for my
fix of American satire? Resigned to
my fate, I then began to think about
reviews and what they mean. It is
something which could be explored
by someone more academic but I’ll
ramble on nevertheless.
I remember when I first started
reading reviews those many years
ago. I started off by reading ones of
things I had bought. This may seem
pointless since theoretically you
read a good review and then go out
and buy the record. However, I read
these reviews to either feel glori-
fied in my choice of purchase or a
review would often give me point-
ers for listening. I was young and
needed guidance I guess, and found
those critics’ professional ears use-
ful. I thought about this some more
and realised that their ears must’ve
had an effect on my own and thus I
was just replicating their opinions.
Thinking about this got me para-
noid; I mean, how do I know what
I really like if I am just replicating
the loop of ‘good-taste’. I then had a
cookie and realised that I have disa-
greed with reviewers all the time.
Ultimately reviews are to give you
a guide to music you might want to
buy. If we aren’t fulfilling this, this
is because public relations compa-
nies for the bands (both independ-
ent and obscure or major label)
send us a limited range of CDs. Our
readership is small so we aren’t
the priority for these companies.
Another reason is that our review-
ers do this voluntarily; they are not
paid to sit down and listen to stuff
they may not ‘get’. We are limited to
our scope of knowledge and taste.

Something you should all go to
is a gig tomorrow (Saturday 21st)
in the Union. It is £3 to get in from
7.30pm with 4 bands playing. There
is a door price because the head-
liner need their flight price covered
as they’re from San Franciso, USA.
They’re called Citizens Here and
Abroad and they’re brilliant. Look
them up online and then come
down. Look out for posters.

most evocative of the theme.
The contrast between the first
song and the next is striking. King
Creosote’s calm, whimiscal ballad
Relate the Tale narrates the plague
of frogs from the point of view of a
frog, and comes across as a defence
of the individual members of the
plague. A similar approach is taken
toward the end of the album by Im-
ogen Heap, whose Glittering Cloud
is a catchy dance number sung in
the character of a positively apolo-
getic locust.
Unfortunately, between these two
songs comes only one of any great
interest – Flies by Brian Eno and
Robert Wyatt, a beautiful pastoral
ambient piece played over a con-
stant buzzing – while the others
range from the insipid to the down-
right irritating.
The end of the album, though, is
every bit as strong as the beginning.
Scott Walker’s Darkness is quite
simply terrifying, with his quiet
tones echoed by a loud, shrill choir,
and Rufus Wainwright’s Katonah
on the death of the firstborn, and
particularly his recently departed
cousin, is profoundly moving.
Plague Songs comes across as
something of an unfinished work.
Whilst the better songs on it are
astounding, to a lesser or greater
extent, almost half of the songs are
uninspiring, verging on unlisten-
able (reminiscent of the plagues).
It feels as though those behind
the project were too polite to re-
ject certain works that didn’t come
up to the level of quality they were
clearly aspiring towards, which is a
terrible shame, given the rest of the
album.

AFI
Brixton Carling Academy
Before I start this review I just want
to clear up a few issues. Yes I know
AFI (A Fire Inside) are rubbish,
they are cheesy and most songs
sound the same. Although they have
followed the likes of Minor Threat
and gone ‘straight edge’, forego-
ing drugs, smoking and alcohol
for the music, they still sold out to
Dreamworks instead of staying on
the small label Nitro; managing to
perform poorer in the moral stand-
ings than the musical. Yet they still
remain my biggest guilty pleasure
and are in my top 5 favourite bands
of all time.
The tour is to promote their new
album Decemberunderground.
The album moves further away
from their punk hardcore roots to
catchier and higher production val-
ue songs with a tint of Duran Du-
ran, god forgive.
Hoping the new album wouldn’t
dominate the show I turned upto
the Brixton Academy an hour-
and-a-half after the doors opened.
I missed the first band and being
subjected to the second (watching
them did involve large quantities of
pain and pity in equal measure).
As the roadies set-up the stage
for the headline act, seeing props
including a white painted tree sus-
pended from the ceiling white white
amplifiers and drum-kit, my heart
sank. Was it going to be an over the
top, soulless gig? I had wished for
something not too far from that 3
minute live video of He Who Laughs
Last I downloaded off Napster so
many years ago.
No, in fact the gig was absolutely
amazing. Opening with the intro to
the latest album the band followed
up with Girls Not Grey, played with
such energy as the band members
ran along rows of monitors and
mounted drum-kits many a time.
Finally the Days of Phoenix intro
rang through the Academy, turn-
ing the sea of Despair Faction T-
shirts into a sweaty frenzy. All my
dreams were answered a few songs
later when they played infamous
All Hallows EP, Totalimmortal.
Nearly 7 years made no difference
to the quality of the performance;it
was electric. The whole band were
decked out in white T-shirts and
jeans, looking almost dangerously
like a bad taste 80s band and al-
though guitarist Puget sported a
full on NME hair-do, Davey Havok
retained the slicked comb over but
not yet bald styling that has de-
fined him through the history of the
band.
The encore, a sensible two songs,
topped it all off, while running
through the anthem God Called
In Sick Today, Havok hardly had
to sing as the audience sang every
word with him, and the latest sin-
gle, Miss Murder was a fine, upbeat
end to the night.

album review
Playing to a venue packed with
black-clad metallers that were quite
clearly awaiting Seether’s resched-
uled performance with restless an-
ticipation, it looked as though it was
going to be difficult for Essex band
Engerica to win the crowd over.
Fortunately, Engerica are used to
playing support slots for bands with
a cult-like following. Engerica ooze
confidence, self-assuredness and
charisma, immediately evident as
front-man David Gardener struts
onto the stage dressed in incredibly
tight trousers and very shiny, pointy
Seether/Engerica
The Astoria, Charing Cross Rd
black shoes. Despite the striking
impression of the front man, the
other members of the band don’t
make such an impact, it appears
that this is David Gardener’s band
and this is his show.
Engerica rattle furiously through
songs from their debut There Are
No Happy Endings. During Did
You Hear What Sylvia Said, The
Smell and Goddamn Suicide you
could visibly see increasingly more
of the audience being won over by
the impressive energy levels that
the band brought to the venue. As
Engerica continued, the crowd did
what they do to show appreciation
of punk-rock i.e. become more and
more violent to one another and
mosh harder and faster. Sadly, de-
spite collecting more fans through-
out the gig, they were not playing to
win over the Seether fans. Engerica
has decided to call it a day after this
tour, thus the band were evidently
playing for their fans, their friends
and themselves. This was made
clear when bassist Mike Webster’s
twin brother Jim was invited to
play drums; this night was about
Engerica enjoying the experience
of playing in one of England’s most
famous venues.
Engerica are evidently a band that
have been slowly but surely growing
in strength; they have been nomi-
nated for a Metal Hammer award,
received rave reviews and played
at Download. Consequently you
get the impression that if had they
postponed their amicable split for a
bit longer, they could have achieved
greater things. They may have been
the support band to Seether, but
Engerica certainly stole the show
at the Astoria. Seether may have
pleased their fans however, with
their Nirvana and Neil Young cov-
ers, they just didn’t match the style
or the raw quality of Engerica.
