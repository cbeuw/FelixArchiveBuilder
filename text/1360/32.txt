Canoes in the Alps
The eagerly anticipated canoe club
trip to the North Alps had finally got
underway, starting with the minor
hiccup of leaving a boat behind and
one of the cars missing the ferry.
We arrived in Kitzbuehel in North-
ern Austria the following afternoon
and set up camp in an extremely
picturesque site. The next day’s
paddling was debated around our
first barbeque of the trip.
The Wies and Pinegg Gorges on
the Brandenberger river were de-
cided on as a suitable first river. For
me, and many others, this would be
the first Alpine and warm weather
paddlingexperience.Thevalleywas
beautiful and the glorious sunshine
was a real novelty. The river was a
gentle affair with a couple of more
significant rapids resulting in just
the odd swim. Back at the campsite
we all tucked into pizza and a few
‘steins’ to start Harry off on his epic
fortnight of beer consumption.
Next day we were back at the
Brandenberger for a further sec-
tion of this river. Again, this was a
gentle run with a couple of more
interesting rapids which resulted
in a number of swims from the less
experienced. Patrick was due to fly
into Salzburg later that afternoon,
fresh from his trip to Norway, so a
girly contingent headed off for an
afternoon’s sightseeing, ice-cream
eating and to provide Patrick with a
suitable welcome. The trip started
badly for him though; we got back to
the campsite to find everyone had
eaten our dinner, having got lost
and picked up a speeding ticket.
We then headed across the bor-
der to stay in Mittenwald in Bavaria
where we found a more natural
campsite on the river’s edge to get
our campfire building off to a good
start. Boats proved particularly
useful for this given that most of
the available wood was on the op-
posite bank! In the three days we
stayed here, the Rissbach, Loisach
and Upper Isar were paddled; all
low volume grade 3, which resulted
in only a handful of swims amongst
the group. This was also the scene
of the biggest disaster of the trip –
Harry dropping the barbeque in the
river – were we all going to starve?
The next destination on our itin-
erary was Landeck – the focus of
the Austrian kayaking scene, and
fortunately also home to a shop
selling barbeques. Dominated by
the mighty Inn, this was the big-
gest volume water many of us had
encountered and required a bit of
getting used to.
Recent floods in the area have
changedtheriversdramaticallyand
several of the ‘classics’ had been
canalised, making them somewhat
hairier. First up was the Rosanna,
a classic grade 3, followed by the
commercially-rafted Imst Gorge –
part of the Inn.
At 250 cumecs, this river was
huge and full of big, bouncy wave
trains which were immensely en-
tertaining for the whole group.
Swims on this kind of water were
certainly trickier to handle, with
people and kit taking somewhat
longer to recover, keeping the more
experienced members of the group
occupied. There were some sig-
Sophie Gore
nificantly harder rivers here for the
‘big boys’ with the Sanna, Tösens.
Lower Oetz, and infamous Inn
Shoot being ticked off by some. Our
final move of the trip led us up the
Inn valley into the Engadine area of
Switzerland. We spent the final few
days of the trip paddling various
sections of the upper reaches of the
Inn. S-Chanfs and the Brail Gorge
proved somewhat low on water,
whilst Giarsuns and Ardez Gorge
gave a welcome challenge to the
brave few. The final section we pad-
dled, the Schuls, proved to be one
of the most challenging paddled by
the whole group with some pretty
tricky grade 4 rapids claiming one
or two victims amongst the group.
So ended a thoroughly enjoyable
trip, a great learning experience for
those on their first Alps trip. Much
beer was consumed and many riv-
ers paddled. We are extremely
grateful to Claire for her excellent
work in organising the trip.

As a special treat to kickstart the

frolicking, fun and festivity.
The event will take place on Sat-
urday the 4th November, leaving
Beit Quad at 9:00am and returning
by 6:00pm in plenty of time for eve-
ryone to head over to Battersea for
the Fireworks.
Tickets are available online, at
the address below, for the bargain
price of £25. This includes your tick-
et and your travel costs. However,
today (Friday 20th October) is the
last day they will be available so get
your skates on and don’t miss out!

eligible to participate in this earth-
shatteringly amazing event then

Arts & Ents outing of joy
Opera and Choir open day
Stuck for something to do on a
Saturday afternoon? Well, here is
something just a little bit different
and exciting. Sinfonietta and IC
Choir are running an Opera Cho-
ruses Day on Saturday the 21st
October. This will take place in
the Great Hall, Sherfield building,
South Kensington Campus.
The rehearsals will kick off at
3:30pm and will finish by approxi-
amtely 7:30pm, interspersed with
tea and cake. What’s more, it is
completely free! The idea of the
day is to introduce people to new
music and to showcase just some
of the exciting oppurtunities of-
fered in these societies. Other mu-
sical groups also involved include
Jazz Big Band, MTSoc, String En-
semble, Symphony Orchestra and
Windband. It is important to real-
ise that no previous musical ex-
perience is necessary. Maybe you
consider yourself a budding diva
or maybe you can’t stand hearing
yourself singing in the shower. No
worries! It’s all about having a bit
of a giggle.
If all that has got you bursting
with excitement, then you may have
to sit down for this next bit. Once
the singing and playing is over the
real party begins; we will be head-
ing over to the union to ‘barnce’ the
night away to a live ceilidh band,
who, being predominantly Irish, are
overqualified in playing folk music!
