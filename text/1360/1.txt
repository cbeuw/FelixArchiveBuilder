More papers
under threat
Westminster University Union’s
student newspaper, The Smoke,
has faced censorship and possible
removal of the Vice President of
Communications over allegations
made in the paper about the state
of Westminster University’s Fresh-
ers’ Fayre.
A piece in the second issue of The
Smoke, titled “Fayre… Or Failure”,
reported on recent student com-
plaints about the Fayre, calling it
“one of the most disorganised… in
the recent past”. Examples of the
complaints were cited, such as a
lack of a major bank stall for over-
seas students to open an account,
a lack of organisation for commer-
cial stalls as they arrived, and a bad
stall layout. They quoted an anony-
mous source as saying that UWSU
is running at a £10,000 deficit, and
that personal rivalries between the
sabbs have been hampering opera-

tions, with the President, Salima
Lanquaye, apparently telling the
other officers that she could han-
dle the bulk of the arrangements
herself.
The UWSU General Manager, the
head of the union staff, apparently
filed an official complaint against
Rayhan Rafiq Omar, the VP Com-
munications, for allowing the is-
sue to go to print. It is not clear
what the sabbs felt was inaccurate
about the article, though they is-
sued an immediate ban and began
removing the paper from its distri-
bution points and readers’ hands.
Mr Omar, understandably furious,
commented to Felix: “I’ve never
seen them do so much work.” The
sabbs have also tabled a motion of
no confidence in Mr Omar.
The General Manager sum-
moned Mr Omar to a disciplinary
panel meeting. However, this took
place via text message sent at
10:15am, with the meeting occur-
ring at 12:30pm the same day. Mr
Omar was unable to attend to at-
tend, due to prior commitments,
and the meeting took place without
him present. However, the sabbs
eventually decided that it was not
appropriate to discipline Mr Omar
without him being present, and
agreed to reconvene in a fortnight’s
time.
Mr Omar, contacted by this re-
porter for comment, feels very
strongly about honouring his word
to the students that he serves. After
the sabbs decided that they would
deliberate on his case without him,
he stated: “My responsibility is to
the students, not myself”, adding
that he could continue to help stu-
dents after being disciplined.
The Smoke is independent from
the UWSU in terms of content, and
funded by the union. Mr Omar and
the other sabbs took decisions at
the beginning of the year to make
it fully independent of any political
infighting within the union, and as
such, the only body that can remove
Mr Omar from his post is the Gen-
eral Meeting.
Mr Omar controls the funding of
the newspaper, and although he
has a right to change content, he
feels his role to be more of a guiding
one, saying: “As long as I am in the
post, I will protect the students who
write for The Smoke, and ensure
what they are doing… can be pub-
lished.” This reporter contacted the
UWSU President for comment; at
the time of going to press, no reply
has been received.
In other news, Felix’s previous
news editor, Chris Miles, has suc-
ceeded in irritating the sabbs at
Bristol University, after asking
questions about the finances of
the Union in his new role as news
editor of university’s student news-
paper. The sabbs have threatened
the paper, Epigram, with withdrawl
of funding and closure, and pos-
sible removal of Mr Miles from his
position.
Massive outrage as
nothing happens
A huge group of students and staff
gathered on campus yesterday,
as it was revealed that absolutely
nothing had happened during the
week. The gathering protested by
going about their daily business as
if nothing had happened, which is in
fact what had happened. You see?
Felix has assembled a special re-
porting team, the Felix Undercover
Investigation Team, or FUCIT for
short, to try to get to the bottom of
this outrageous farce. This loose as-
sembly of tireless men and women
of journalism scoured the campus
from the broad, slightly blinding
white space of Dalby Court to the
lofty heights of the sabbs’ offices
in Beit Towers, trying to locate an
answer for you, dear reader, to the
eternal question: “What the fuck
are we going to put on the front
page?”
Initially,FUCITtoyedwiththeidea
of filling the page with lorem ipsum
and knocking off early to the pub for
a few swift lagers and a stomach-
destroying Union chilli-with-nach-
os, but this plan was scuppered by
a rather angry editor wielding what
he likes to call his “angry stick” and
threatening everything from frac-
tures to forcible orifice insertion.
Ejected from the Felix office by the
editor’s lackeys, FUCIT decided
the next best course of action would
be to wander up to Beit Towers and
see if they could steal anything
from the photocopiers that might
be horribly incriminating. Sadly, all
the team located was a photocopy
of some unidentified body parts
covered with hair, and a copy of the
Governance Report autographed
by the Union President, John Col-
lins. They did bump into a certain
online newspaper editor along the
way, who could be heard yelling,
rather angrily, “why won’t you lot
make a mistake?”
FUCIT, that bastion of journalistic
integrity, tried to obtain comment
from the sabbs. Eric Lai, Deputy
President (Cakes & Snacks) was
unavailable for comment, as he
was wandering the halls ques-
tioning passers-by: “Does anyone
know how to get the Internet on my
phone?”
Ben Harris, Deputy President
(Fluff & Stuff), initially displayed re-
luctance to talk to FUCIT, but then
darkly muttered something about
“ULU.. damn journalists.. NUS..”
before collapsing into a immobile
heap. Jon Matthews, Deputy Presi-
dent (Pounds & Pennies), used his
comment-making machine to say:
“It would not be appropriate for me
to make comment at this juncture.”
Sir John Collins (Punion Resident)
officially refused to make comment,
before adding under his breath:
“Off the record, old chap, but being
President is a fine old lark.” Shama
Rahman, Deputy President (Girl’s
Stuff), unfortunately could not hear
FUCIT knocking on her door, as the
volume of her modern beat combo
music was sufficient to vibrate
nearby fixtures.
When asked for comment by FU-
CIT, Andy Sykes, Felix Editor, said:
“What the hell are you doing back in
here? I thought I told you go make
up news. Here comes the pain!”
