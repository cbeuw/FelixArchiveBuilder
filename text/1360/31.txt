Greetings, crossword fans.
As I’m sure you’ve all learnt by
now, my crosswords usually have
a few quirks, and this week’s is no
different. For some reason I seem
to have been obsessed by the word
“in” while writing it. Not sure why,
but it might give you the odd clue.
On the other hand it might be to-
tally useless. Who knows?
Some more useful advice is to
work from the middle. There are
so many damn clues in there that
some of them will fill themselves
in. Someone remind me never to
design a grid that requires number-
ing to 30 again. Have fun - I’m off to
bed for 2 weeks. Writing crosswords
is very strenuous, you know.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
You decide to buy
Garth Marenghi’s
Darkplace on DVD
because it’s out.
Right now. Right this
instant! You watch the
hallowed disc and never consider
regretting your purchase as laugh-
ing makes your sides to split open
in a bloody, horrific mess.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Certain events
reveal to you that
toffee is actually the
remains of hunted
foxes ground up into a
paste and mixed with
huge amounts of sugar. You try to
explain it to your friends and fam-
ily, but they can’t hear you because
you’re a fox. Or something.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
During an exciting
caving trip in the
Rocky Mountains, you
encounter a talka-
tive brown bear. After
dicussing the pros and
cons of beech veneer when com-
pared to Venezuelan maple, she
asks you to have a gander at her
beaver. Head first, you oblige.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You discover that
anything you listen
to while you go about
your daily business
suddenly seems to
sync up with what’s
happening around you. This goes
horribly wrong the morning you
select Slayer’s Reign In Blood for
your daily tube journey.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
You decide to find out
what the fuss about
heaven is. Calcula-
tions conclude you
need to build a ladder
from staples in order
to reach the pearly gates. After 22
creative years, you climb for all
your worth. God is playing dice and
a stray roll hits you for six.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
While you idly dream
of playing hide the
pickle with the girl
from labs, a tiny
leprechaun appears
on your cheese
sandwich. However, you’re so
engrossed in your mental shag-
a-thon you fail to notice this, and
munch his tiny frame to bits.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Horoscope fans:
there’s a chica with
gigantic orbs sitting
opposite me as I en-
lighten you all with my
wisdom. I don’t think
she’s noticed me, so I’ll play safe
for now and stick to a bonobo mat-
ing call, before moving in for the
kill, Eastern Iranian platypus style.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Beauty is in the eye of
the beholder. Unfortu-
nately for you, you are
so hideously ugly that
any puppy unlucky
enough to catch a
glimpse of your face has a massive
canine embolism and dies. You
decide to use your powers for evil,
not good.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
This week you defeat
your nemesis and his
stocky Swedish right
hand man. You get the
girl. You get to play
tonsil hockey whilst
the golden sunshine shimmers on
the mercury sea. You get to sail
away in a power boat. You get to
see your name as the credits roll.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
You might have
noticed horoscopes
seem to have taken
a turn towards the
downright surreal.
This is because there
is very little air in the Felix office,
and those of us who aren’t suf-
fering from terminal hypoxia are
hallucinating wildly.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Sitting in the JCR,
your attention is
diverted to the brain
in your knee as it
pulsates. Closer
inspection reveals an
inhabited land where minute men
swing gaily from hair to hair. You
shower. The tsunami kills millions.
You just lost all your friends. Loser.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Hey, have you noticed
how the symbol for
cancer here looks
like two people, well,
providing mutual
relief? I think it’s
pretty rad. So, like, this is good
shit, man. What time is it? Dude,
we should put those mini-pizzas in,
I’m starving.
