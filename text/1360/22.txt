A great scientist
400 years later, and Galileo’s choices are still relevant to us all
If anyone fits the definition of gen-
ius, it has to be Galileo: mathema-
tician, physicist, and inventor. By
developing the telescope, he made
important observations that al-
lowed him to challenge ancient
cosmology and the prevailing view
of mankind’s place in the Universe.
But The Life of Galileo is more than
the story of a great scientist: it is a
political work meant to provoke as
well as to entertain.
Brecht uses Galileo’s life as the
skeleton upon which to hang the
flesh of a fictional narrative dealing
with timeless themes: science ver-
sus religion, reason versus dogma,
humanity versus authority.
The drama lies in Galileo’s
dogged pursuit of what he sees as
the truth, wherever it may take
us. This threatens both religious
dogma and the stability of the old
order, and brings him into conflict
with the Church.
Galileo is no superhuman, though.
He is portrayed instead as a man
in the raw: flawed, obsessive, iras-
cible, and reckless. His reactions
are as much visceral as cerebral,
his pleasures alimentary as well as
astronomical. While he can under-
stand the meaning of his discover-
ies, is he also a man enough to face
their consequences?
We learn in a cliffhanger scene
of high tension that Galileo’s reli-
gious and dutiful daughter wishes
her father to recant his heresies
and be spared torture at the hands
of the Inquisition. His loyal sup-
porters want Galileo to stick to his
beliefs and stand up for the truth
regardless. What does he choose?
What are his motives? What are the
consequences?
Brecht asks questions of us.
Should science be pursued for its
own sake? Should scientists be
responsible to society for their ac-
tions? Should political expediency
or religious fundamentalism be al-
lowed to suppress the truth? We
are left to ponder the answers and
to find our own position in current
debates about cloning, creationism,
and climate change.
David Hare’s fine adaptation
features the typically assured and
energetic Simon Russell Beale
making the best of the title role.
The supporting cast is also excel-
lent and some of the most powerful
speeches come from the Cardinal
Inquisitor, the Donald Rumsfeld
figure of his era – a cold, calculating
character with little interest in the
niceties of arithmetic.
Appropriately, the actors travel
together on the revolving stage
during frequent scene changes,
neatly reminding us that, in riding
the whirling roundabout of human
affairs, we are all as one on our
spinning Earth.
The Life of Galileo runs until
the end of October. The remaining
performances are pretty well sold
out so you will need to be lucky, or
clever, to get hold of tickets.

Beer Guru’s Guide
“Enlightenment for those who
thirst for knowledge,” says the
front cover. As every student is
searching for knowledge, I delved
into the realm of the beer guru.
This self-
proclaimed
individual
promises to
guide the
reader into
truly ex-
periencing
beer, and
becoming
at one with
your inner-
beer guru.
I get the
impression
that a pint
of Carlsberg
with over an
inch of head,
served in a
plastic cup
in the un-
ion, is not what the beer guru is
teaching.
From this book you learn about
the inner mysteries of beer, and
its wonderful hallucinogenic
properties. However, if you are
reading this, you are probably
more than well aware of what a
marvellous substance it really is.
It is said that alcohol is probably
responsible for many of the so-
called magic potions and witch-
doctory of the past – who can
honestly say that they have not
felt like Superman after a night
on the booze? This book explains
in a light-hearted way about how
beer is truly a sacred beverage,
to be appreciated by all, and not
to be ruined by cheaply made, re-
gionally licensed lager.

preciate your beer, from examin-
ing its aura (brown aura leads to
headaches, deep blue aura turns
you into a moody bugger), to cre-
ating an altar for your beer (deco-
rated with your team’s colours),
to how to listen to your beer talk-
ing (it may tell you the lottery
numbers). This book is amusing
in a not-too-sophisticated way:
you could read out a couple of
lines with your mates and have a
laugh at it.
Having said all this, the book is
not really the sort of book you can
actually sit down and read. It is
the kind of book that you buy your
Dad on Fathers Day, because you
cannot think of a proper gift to
get him.
It is funny in its own way, but
I did not find it as good as some
of the many other beer guides on
the market. It reads as if it was
written between the cast of Men
Behaving Badly crossed with the
Dalai Lama, and paying £10 for a
book which is essentially nothing
more than a bit of humour seems
a bit steep. If it were half the price,
I might recommend it, but as it
stands, The Beer Guru’s Guide is
not really worth the money.
