“The periodic table is an iconic
symbol of science, but it’s easy
to forget what is so great about it.
Anyone who has studied chemis-

that shows off the elements in all
their organised glory.”

What would your life be like then?
What you are envisaging is not

“Galileo is no superhuman He is
a man in the raw: flawed, obses-

reactions are as much visceral as
cerebral, his pleasures alimentary
as well as astronomical.”

Abusive ex-student
disrupts Ethos pool
An ex-student has been “abusive
and out of order” while at the Ethos
swimming pool, aggressively con-
fronting staff and students after a
training session overran.
Ethos provides external coaches
from an organisation called Fast
Fins to the Swim & Waterpolo Club
free of charge during their training
sessions. These are usually split
into two halves, with the swimmers
in the first session, and the water-
polo players in the second session.
The trouble started when the first
session overran. A member of the
club, Ares Protopapas, became
irate at the external coaches at
the poolside, asking them to hurry
up and clear the pool. The coaches
were in the process of concluding
the session, but this apparently was
not enough for Mr Protopapas, who
disrupted the end of the session
and jumped in the pool.
After the event, the club’s Presi-
dent, Sophie Mitchinson, sent an
email to the club’s mailing list.
The email asked members to try
to be punctual to training sessions
to prevent overrun, to stay out of
the pool until a coach has checked
whether the trainee is a club mem-
ber, and to wait patiently should
the first session overrun. Mr Pro-
topapas decided that this was not
sufficient, and sent an email to the
entire list, as well as the Rector, Sir
Richard Sykes. The email, entitled
somewhat bizarrely, “of timekeep-
ing, sportsmanship and tobacco”,
accused the swimmers of monopo-
lising the pool and not taking into
account the fact that “some of us
have various professional and other
obligations”.
It also included a rather strange
personal attack against the coach-
es themselves, stating: “I person-
ally find the presence of ‘civilian’
persons (business managers etc
in mufti [civilian dress], without
appropriate ID, uniform, or good
manners and reeking of tobacco
smoke) rather inappropriate for the
Ethos poolside.” Mr Protopapas’
complaint seems to be that he felt
he had been treated badly by the
coaches, and that wearing “IC col-
ours/trunks” should have entitled
him to preferential treatment.
Mr Protopapas should not have
been able to join the club, as he is
no longer a student at the College,
and hence no longer a Union mem-
ber. He was able to join via the web-
site due to an administrative error
by ICT, which still had his status set
as a current student. He has since,
allegedly, claimed life membership
of the Union; however, no records of
this exist.
In an email leaked to Felix by
an anonymous source, Neil Mos-
ley, head of Sport Imperial, stated
that Mr Protopapas must abide by
Ethos’ codes of practice, or he will
be banned from using the centre.
Grant Deskine, operations man-
ager for Sport and Leisure, stated
that the partnership with Fast Fins
to provide additional coaching at no
extra cost has been “very impres-
sive”. He also stated that he “does
not feel one ‘minor’ issue should
be blown out of all proportion by an
individual who is not even a mem-
ber of the student body”, confirm-
ing that the Rector’s office has also
come to this conclusion.
Felix attempted to contact Mr
Protopapas for comment; no reply
was forthcoming at the time of go-
ing to press.

Elections much
less of a farce now
Andy Sykes
The Council elections have become
less farcical, with the Union Presi-
dent, John Collins, changing the
rules to allow people to stand.
The GSA elections did have all
signs of becoming a classic Union
election farce, but a number of peo-
ple are now standing for the avail-
able posts after a heavy campaign
of e-mailing and approaching post-
graduates. However, the second-
ing appeared to be a problem, with
many candidates having only one
or two seconders. Mr Collins decid-
ed to interpret the constitution re-
garding elections, which says that
candidates “normally require” ten
seconders in order to stand, and
‘waved through’ those who had a
few seconders.
However, hustings still appeared
to be as pointless as ever, despite
the enthuisiasm of Mr Collins,
which a few students lunching qui-
etly in the JCR found somewhat off-
putting if the heckles are to be be-
lieved. The candidates for the GSA
can only be voted for by postgradu-
ates, and several students then
raised the question of why hustings
for these positions took place in the
JCR instead of the SCR. Mr Collins
responded that masters’ students
are not permitted in the SCR, but
are still represented by the GSA.
The RON campaign, run by
Stephen Brown (RAG Chair) this
year, got a far better reception than
any of the other candidates, with
some responses to questions mak-
ing the whole room chuckle. When
discussing the Equal Opportunities
Officer post, Mr Brown said: “I’d re-
name it Athletics Union Officer.”
Corrections and clarifications
In issue 1359, we included this claim in the front page story about
the incident at Wye Campus: “Concerns have also been raised over
the fact that students were still being served in the bar, despite be-
ing clearly drunk.” We have since learned that this is incorrect; the
student in question arrived at the bar drunk already, and was rightly
refused service by the bar staff. We sincerely apologise for this
inaccuracy.
