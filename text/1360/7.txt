Turning the tables on Mendeleev
As we approach the 100th anniversary of his death we take a look back at the man responsible for that chart
Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was
born in Tobolsk, Siberia in Febru-
ary 1834. His father died when
Mendeleev was around 13 years
old, leaving his mother Maria to
raise the family on her own. Money
was tight, following the loss to fire
of his mother’s family business,
and his only chance of going to uni-
versity was to win a scholarship.
In 1849, the family relocated to St
Petersburg, where Mendeleev was
accepted into the Main Pedagogical
Institute.
Mendeleev married his first wife
Feozva Nikitichna around 1862, un-
der the influence of his sister Olga.
However, 8 years and two children
later, the couple was living sepa-
rately. In 1877, Mendeleev met and
became infatuated with Anna Pop-
ova, a teenaged art student staying
in Petersburg with his older sister
Ekaterina. When Mendeleev first
proposed in 1879, Anna turned him
down and was sent away to Rome
by her father. Not to be deterred,
Mendeleev went to Rome in 1881
and proposed again, vowing to kill
himself if she refused him. She ac-
cepted, and Mendeleev and his first
wife were divorced in February
1882. According to Orthodox law,
Mendeleev should have waited sev-
en years before marrying Anna, but
the couple was married in January
1882, earning Mendeleev public no-
toriety as a bigamist.
While most people recognize
Mendeleev as the primary creator
of the periodic table of the elements,
Naomi Antony few are aware of his other pursuits.
Mendeleev was passionate about
metrology. In the early 1860s, he
played a central role in the Ministry
of Finance’s strategy to reform the
state’s alcohol industry by convert-
ing Russian volumes and weight
measures to metric ones. Con-
vinced that the introduction of the
metric system would be symbolic of
a westernizing Russia, he advocat-
ed its introduction throughout the
1860s. Mendeleev was eventually
appointed Director of the Bureau of
Weights and Measures in 1893.
In the 1870s, Spiritualism began
to spread across Russia in a wave
of frenzy. The focus was on séances,
usually led by a medium. Many of
Mendeleev’s colleagues, including
Aleksandr Butlerov, were drawn to
spiritualism. Mendeleev helped es-
tablish the ‘Commission for the In-
vestigationofMediumisticPhenom-
ena’ in order to prove that mediums
were frauds. From 1875-1876, he at-
tended several séances, writing up
reports after each one. In a series
of lectures, he publicly attacked
spiritualism, declaring seances as
“simple-minded manipulation of
the rheotric of facts.” The spiritual-
ist community was outraged as he
had violated their codes of practice
by faking noises during one of the
Elementary, my
dear Dimitri
The periodic table is an iconic sym-
bol of science, but it’s easy to forget
what is so great about it. Anyone
who has studied chemistry will be
familiar with the table that shows
off the elements in all their organ-
ised glory. But when Mendeleev
first proposed it back in 1869, only
sixty of the elements were known
and the idea that the similarity of
elements could tell us anything fun-
damental about their nature was
unexplored.
The table as we know it today
shows 115 elements in ‘groups’, dis-
played in columns, and ‘periods’ in
rows, but in the early nineteenth
century even the elements them-
selves were not well defined. Any
similarities in the way they com-
bined or looked were curious but
not regarded as very important.
Atomic weight could be determined
(similar to our measure of relative
atomic mass) but what this meant
for the element was unclear.
By 1817 patterns began to
emerge. Johann Dobereiner noted
that when three similar elements
were lined up in atomic weight or-
der, the properties of the middle
one would often be the average of
the other two. After the publication
of more accurate atomic weights in
1860, a flurry of new ideas surfaced
that speculated of a higher rela-
tionship. In 1862 the French geolo-
gist A.E. Beguyer de Chancourtois
noted that not only did these simi-
larities exist but that when ordered
by atomic weight they occurred
roughly every eighth element. The
table’s shape was evolving.
Chancourtois could have claimed
the creation of the first periodic
table, but the dense and incompre-
hensible nature of his publication
meant it met with little success. Er-
rors in identifying and placing ele-
ments seriously limited the table’s
practical use.
Mendeleev himself is supposed
to have happened upon the idea of
putting the elements into a table
whilst playing a game of patience.
Having written the properties of
the elements on the cards, while re-
arranging them he noticed the reg-
ular pattern of eight with certain
types of elements always followed
by another type.
The publication of Mendeleev’s
‘Periodic System’ in 1869 overshad-
owed other contemporary papers.
In part this was because of the well-
timed release but also due to its
sheer ambition. Mendeleev was so
impressed by the simplicity of the
repeating pattern that where the
atomic weights disrupted it, he ig-
nored them. Elements were put the
where its properties said it should
go. Where he found inconsisten-
cies he double-checked results -
performing his own atomic weight
experiments. If still he found no el-
ement to fit a space, he left a gap,
prefering to believe there were
elements undiscovered, rather
than concede to anomalies in the
pattern.
These gaps helped prior Men-
deleev make predictions about the
missing elements. From looking
at an empty position in the table
he could predict the properties of
the mystery element with great
accuracy. Two of these were found
within 15 years of publication and
the precise nature of his predic-
tions served to cement the value of
his periodic system.
In the end Mendeleev correctly
repositioned fourteen different ele-
ments in defiance of their accepted
atomic weight and predicted ten
entirely new ones, seven of which
were later found.
Over the years scientists have
amended the table with new dis-
coveries and observations. Lord
Rayleigh added a ‘group zero’ of
newly discovered noble gases in
1895 and Henry Mosley lead a reor-
dering according to atomic charge
rather than weight, after discover-
ies of isotopes showed that these
did not always correspond.
The following century saw a
search for the reasons behind the
elements’ fundamental similarities
displayed in Mendeleev’s table. An
atomic explanation for the behav-
iour of elements relating physical
and chemical properties to atomic
weight and charge is now deeply
rooted in our understanding of
chemistry and matter itself.

séances (which he admitted).
Mendeleev had little patience for
Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, finding
them torturously descriptive. He
preferred works of adventure, par-
ticularly those by Jules Verne, and
attempted Vernesque adventure
in his own life twice. He developed
a fascination with ballooning, a
pursuit that he believed would aid
him with his meteorological stud-
ies, and took flight in 1887 to study
the solar eclipse of 7 August 1887;
an event documented in his article
An Air Flight From Klin during the
Eclipse. Then, inspired by Verne’s
A Journey To The North Pole, Men-
deleev attempted an Arctic adven-
ture of his own. Together with S.O.
Makarov, a naval hero, he built an
icebreaker on which he proposed
a journey to chart a viable north-
ern sea route (Gordin 2004). Alas,
his efforts to get his plan endorsed
failed and he fell out with Makarov,
to whom he never spoke again.
It is evident that Mendeleev was
far more than just a chemist. As
well as a metrologist, meteorolo-
gist and advocate against Spiritual-
ism, Mendeleev was also an active
citizen, committed to improving the
technological advances of Russia
and deeply concerned about the
social problems of his time. His
well-publicised rejection from the
Academy Of Sciences in 1880 only
increased his popularity, elevating
him to an almost celebrity status
and, to this day, he remains Rus-
sia’s most recognised scientific
name. Mendeleev passed away in
January 1907, aged 73.
