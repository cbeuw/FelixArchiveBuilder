Narnia. All you have to do, is put
in a bit of your time to attend these
press conferences and write up a
short review and voila, you have an-
other A-list star to the list of people
you have seen.
If that’s not interesting enough,
how about free movies? Film Felix
is always looking for people who
love movies and who love free mov-
ies even better. Most of the time,
we get invites to press scrceenings
for movies that had not even been
released in the cinemas. First plus
point, you get to see the movie eve-
ryone’s been waiting to see. Sec-
ond plus point, you get to watch it
in a plush review room. Third plus
point, it’s absolutely free. All you
have to do is write a short review
and you can see your name in print
for it. Fantastic deal, isn’t it?
Let’s not forget the free tickets.
During the weekends, we need peo-
ple to review some of the upcoming
movies. The system works with me
sending out a list of movies I want
reviewed to the people who have
indicated their interest to review
films. And then, I hand out two
tickets for you to watch the movie.
So let’s not forget, you can bring a
friend to watch the movie with you.
Way to bring up your popularity
rating!
So how do you get your hands in
this fantastic opportunity?
Just email me at film.felix@
imperial.ac.uk. Tell me your name,
your contact number and the kind
of films you want to review i.e. hor-
ror, chick-flick, romantic comedies,
etc.
I’ll do the editing, you do the writ-
ing. Stop me before I enforce any-
more of my opinions on all the films
you have to watch!
Upcoming films:
Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The
Beginning, The Good Year, The
Grudge 2 and Marie Antoinette.
Remember if you love movies,
this is the sweetest spot for movies
at absolutely zero cost.
Boys make A-Level History
In a not too distant past, History Boys were fighting to get into Oxford and Cambridge
Not too long ago, we were all A-Lev-
el students fighting for the prom-
ised land of university, a land where
we were supposed to achieve our
fullest potential while making our
entrances in the best alchol-influ-
enced student parties.
In History Boys, eight bright, fun-
ny history students in the north of
England in the mid 1980s are in the
process of pursuing an undergradu-
ate place at the country’s two finest
universities. The school’s headmas-
ter is obsessed with breaking into
the ranks of those schools that reg-
ularly send boys up to Oxford and
Cambridge. Hence, Irwin, a shrewd
newcomer, is enlisted to coach the
boys into intellectual shape for the
trials ahead.
While the boys are seduced by the
exam-busting bag of tricks offered
by the temporary supply teacher,
the story becomes just a little spici-
er as the boys are torn by their loy-
alty to the hugely eccentric, poetry-
spouting English master Hector
and the regular diet of nourishing
facts and figures dispensed by Mrs.
Lintott, their history mistress.
The journey of The History Boys
becomes a light-hearted and eye-
opening exploration of the educa-
tion system and lulls into the story
through the perspectives of eight
boys whom you could easily relate
to. Now you know the story, I’m
sure you want to win History Boys
merchandise and tickets. Felix is
offering three lucky readers the
chance to win a History Boys mer-
chandise (T-shirts, keychains, pens
and so much more!) and the first
lucky reader to answer the follow-
ing questions correctly two tickets
to watch the movie in addition to
The History Boys merchandise. So
get your pens out!
1 Tell me the name of the History
Boys’ school.
2 Tell me the name of the script
writer.
3 Tell me the name of the director.

The Simpsons is mute compared
to this seriously dysfunctional fam-
ily. A short recap for those who
must have fallen out of the world:
Peter is the lazy, good-for-nothing
father; Lois is the hot mother who
must have a fetish for ugly fat men;
Stewie is the destructive and hor-
ribly intelligent baby with the posh
British accent. As for the rest of the
children - Meg just pales into insig-
nifcance while Chris is the boy who
has just reached puberty.
Felix is offering two readers an
opportunity to win The Family Guy
Season 5 which will be available to
buy on DVD on 30th October 2006.
Family Guy Seasons 1-5 box set is
released on the same date. Just tell
me the answer to these questions:
1 Who is Lois’ long-lost brother?
2 And what particular people does
her long-lost brother like to kill?

To our lovely readers in the won-
derful campus of Imperial College,
a great big welcome to the fresh-
ers and a welcome back to the sea-
soned readers.
Please be aware that this is an im-
passioned plea for the rest of you to
put your pens to writing something
that’s fun and has absolutely noth-
ing to do with science, business or
medicine.
If that silent plea did not already
frighten you, this is what you stand
to gain if you write for the Felix Film
section. I know London is a hot bed
for A-list stars, but what if you get
the chance to participate in press
conferences without having to line
up for hours in the sodding rain?
Film Felix had many amazing op-
portunities last year thanks to many
wonderful PR agencies. We’ve met
and even talked to people like Ash-
ton Kutcher, Sarah Jessica Parker,
50 Cent, Erica Bana and the cast
and crew for The Chronicles Of
