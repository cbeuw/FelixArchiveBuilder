G
ood afternoon, my
nocturnal friends,
and welcome to an-
other nightlife page,
with an actual review
this week so I know at least one of
you has been going out. Person-
ally, I have been recovering from
a week of fun and games with my
Imperial College society of choice:
the Alternative Music Society
(AMS).
Presided over from afar by our
favourite supreme nightlife editor
Greg, the AMS strives to improve
the lives of poor lonely Freshers
with better taste in music than
is good for them. Having been a
member since I was a first year, I
have seen the society rise from the
primordial sludge and evolve into
a thriving social network. Never
overburdened with members, the
society provides an opportunity to
meet people with similar musical
tastes and learn about different
types of music, as well as just gen-
erally having a very nice time.
On that note, I will conclude this
column by strongly recommend-
ing the AMS’s own Kids Will Be
Skeletons gig night at the union
on Saturday 21st October, where
you will hear lots of sumptuous
and delicious music flowing into
your ears from real live bands.

Hard house at The Fridge
Insekt’s second birthday at The Fridge brings out the clubbing masses in full force
It must have taken a pretty inspir-
ing line-up to encourage myself
and the other few remaining sur-
vivors of the Tidy Weekender 10
(held only the previous weekend)
out just 4 days after the 3 day hard
house overdose we experienced
up in Wales. Those able bodies
who hadn’t enjoyed the fun of Tidy
needed little persuading. I am sure
to attend Insekt’s second birthday
at The Fridge, Brixton with Karim,
Paul Glazby and Justin Bourne lay-
ing on a night of nothing but pure
filthy hard house for the listening
and stomping pleasure of 1000 very
satisfied customers. Previously a
monthly event held at Fire Club,
Vauxhall, Insekt events are less fre-
quent now due to losing residency
there, but the masses came out in
full force to celebrate Insekt’s sec-
ond birthday.
Dontstayin.com gave away a few
coveted tickets in their competition,
but I’m sure all who paid the fifteen
pounds for entry would agree that it
was money well spent; I tried not to
look too smug as I walked in (plus
one) for free! The Fridge’s location,
fortunately, somewhat exempted it
from steep London drinks prices:
three pounds for a beer in compari-
son to anything from four pounds
to six pounds in Central London.
Following a raid back in April, The
Fridge has since under gone a re-
furbishment. Although it has lost a
bit of that grimy feel which used to
add a special something to a night
out, it still managed to match the
style of the music excellently: we
came for a bit of filth and that’s
what we received!
Arriving at around eleven thirty,
we did not have to queue at all but
entered to find the place pretty
full, yet with a reasonable amount
of space for an hour or so for some
high energy dancing to kick start
our evening. The crowd was no
where near as mixed as usual: next
to no cybers, mainly 20s/30s, all very
friendly. James Nardi initiated our
night with some full on hard techy
house to get the excitement up. De-
fective Audio’s live PA left no one
disappointed, especially the male
clientele who got to gaze upon the
scantily clad dancers on stage! Hav-
ing nearly exhausted what energy I
had in me I was ready to flake had it
not been for the excellent timing of
Karim’s 3am set. The ferocity with
which he lashed out the tunes was
electric and had everyone on their
feet by the time “Have Faith” was
played.
The Electro room, hosted by Too-
muchbutneverenough.com, added
an alternative interlude to the fast
paced music of the main room, to
those after a chill out on the comfy
leather sofas. Eduardo Herrera
played out some excellent filthy
techno for those of us wanting to
keep on our feet to a slower yet still
heavy beat. The ‘Ice Box’ room was
relatively empty, which was some-
times a welcome change from the
busy crowd in the main arena. Liv-
ing up to its name, The Fridge never
became overheated at all. Quite the
contrary, the air conditioning pro-
vided relief for those sending their
temperatures soaring all night. Too
often a night is spoiled if the venue
is stifling.
Back in the main arena, once Ka-
rim had ended a particularly sat-
isfactory set, it was time for Paul
Glazby back to back with Justin
Bourne. Although enjoying a prac-
tically perfect concluding set from
Glazby the week before, he still
managed to top his prior perform-
ance. The pounding filthy beats
came on relentlessly leaving no op-
portunity for a break! Although by
Marc Johnson’s culminating set
the club’s numbers had dwindled,
those remaining gave it their all.
The brave stayed on for the free
after party whilst us Tidy veterans
headed home, completely spent but
in the knowledge we had enjoyed a
blindingly good night!

This man is probably much friendlier than he looks.
Pure filthy
hard house for
your stomping
pleasure
Fabric has been bringing us a var-
ied array of exciting electronic
music for seven years now and
they have decided to stretch the
definition of a weekend to breaking
point, with five days of music start-
ing on the 19th of October, so you’ve
missed the start already. Never fear
though, for there are still four more
days of musical mayhem to follow.
On Friday the club sees, amongst
others, Stanton Warriors, Scratch
Perverts, and Switch take to the
decks, with Foreign Beggars and
Bondo Do Role providing live
music.
Saturday brings another impres-
sive list of DJs and performers,
with names such as Ricardo Villa-
lobos and Matthew Dear as well as
Lindstrom performing live.
On Sunday, ‘polysexual’ club-
night DTPM descends upon Fabric,
bringing with it a surprise guest DJ
along with Malcolm Duffy and Nick
Pryce.
After the end of the real weekend,
you’ll have to wait a few more days
before the fun begins (and ends)
again on the following Thursday,
when Adventures In The Beetroot
Field hits Fabric, with Simian Mo-
bile Disco and Filthy Dukes DJing,
Fabric turns seven years old
Elderly London club pushes the limits of the term ‘weekend’

down House and Techno, Broken
