Back in 2003, Amy Winehouse crept
onto the scene with her critically-
acclaimed debut album Frank, but
the world wasn’t listening. Nomina-
tions for a Mercury and Brit award
finally had copies flying off the
shelves and it went on to be certi-
fied multi-platinum.
Fast-forward three years and
she's back, a couple of pounds light-
er but her voice is just as full-bodied
and husky as it has ever been.
Rehab, the first single off the al-
bum, sees the Londoner ditching
her signature jazzy roots charac-
terized by the complex chord struc-
tures in favour of a simpler and
soulful gospel sound.
It is just the right amount of
quirky and maybe that’s why she
will remind some of Macy Gray
(without the homicidal tendencies).
Rehab is unlikely to grace the top of
the charts anytime soon (although
it thoroughly deserves to) but it
does prove that urban British mu-
sic doesn’t have to be childish and
chavvy. I think a certain Ms. Lily Al-
len should take note.

I like to think I have an open mind
when it comes to music – I even ad-
mit to owning Shania Twain CDs.
However I can only assume this
song was produced using the follow-
ing process: Step 1, for inspiration
watch Rick Waller have a colosto-
my; Step 2, Inspired by the ‘rich and
powerful’ aromas write lyrics such
as “You never asked me to say ooo-
oo-ooo”; Step 3, after failing to flog
it to North Korea as a WMD, pack-
age it up with cover art designed by
the work experience kid and ship it
out to literally thousands of ador-
ing fans, with a combined age lower
than Rick Waller’s weight (in tons).
It’s tempting to describe the song
as a polished turd simply for at-
tempting to rhyme ‘kissed me’ with
‘frisbee’, however I fear even Mr
Muscle developed ear cancer after
listening to this drivel.

Take A Chance

The astounding thing about The
Magic Numbers, if you ask me, is
how on earth they got to be so popu-
lar? It really does boggle the mind
how they got to become one of the
most talked about bands. I might
just be bitter that they sound almost
exactly like Belle & Sebastian but
far more twee and syrupy, and don't
show enough of their pop-like side
as Belle & Sebastian show. If you
bought the album on the strength
of the singles, you will have been
suitably annoyed that there were
no extra pop-tastic indie-folk tunes.
But you must at least admit that
the singles are surprisingly good.
Take a Chance has a fun, bouncy
beat that is matched by a relentless
and quite catchy vocal line. This is
if you can stand Romeo Stodart's
whiny, aurally painful singing voice.
Frankly I can't. It makes me want
to shoot things. But the music is

EP review
This EP is the first release out-
side Canada from Justin Langlois
aka The London Apartments and
the press release certainly makes
a good go at granting him the all
important indie credibility that
may help push him onto the world
stage; the references to obscure in-
fluences are interspersed with the
heartwarming tale of a teenager
creating tracks on his computer
in his bedroom and getting them
noticed with a little bit of help our
good friend the internet.
Then there’s the ridiculous name.
I can almost imagine the thought
process that brought it about, ‘A
pluralised name for my one-man-
band? Why not? It worked for
Bright Eyes.’ So far so indie. It
could only be better if Justin wasn’t
from Ontario because everyone
knows all the cool kids are from
Montreal (Godspeed You! Black
Emperor and The Arcade Fire to
name a couple).
Once I got bored with the self
promotion I figured I should prob-
ably get around to listening to the
CD and I must admit it’s a polished
piece of work.
Breathy and somewhat ethereal
vocals float on top of an electronic
back-drop of bleeps and beats. It
makes strangely hypnotic listen-
ing. I think the most obvious com-
parison is to Icelandic band Sigur
Ros.
The similarity between the other-
worldly vocals both employ is quite
striking. Also their lyrics share the
same unintelligble quality, although
in the case of the Icelandics this
may be achieved by singing mainly
in a fictional language.
Where the differences really start
is with the range of sonic palette
both artists can employ. Whilst Sig-
ur Ros always have a trick up their
sleeve, be it a guitar played with a
cello bow or the ever-present threat
of the brass section, this record is
much more limited.
No matter how varied the elec-
tronic backing is there is a tendency
for it all to blend into one giving the
impression of an EP with one ex-
ceptionally long track rather than
four shorter ones. Whether this is
good thing or not I would imagine
depends very much on whether one
is trying to get to sleep at the time
or not.
This sounds far harsher than I
intend to be. This is certainly an ac-
complished debut and I did enjoy it.
It is definitely worth a listen if you
enjoy the kind of ambient, vocal-
driven sound it employs.
However it seems limited in
scope – there’s only so much you
can do with drum machines and
synthesiser software and this
record seems to hit that wall.
That being said I do hope to here
more from Justin Langlois, if he
can achieve something like this
with just his computer then I’d love
to hear what he could do leading
the band implied by the name he
has chosen for his project.
So look out for this guy in the fu-
ture I'm sure we’ll be hearing from
him again, I just hope it's not in the
form of backing music for a car
advert.

Sean Lennon
Dead Meat

place accompanying the dramatic
orchestral backing.
You can really hear his anguish
over the subject matter, his recent
ending of a long-term relationship.
Whilst he doesn’t express the emo-
tion lyrically, the melodramatic
mood of the song conveys this per-
fectly. A guitar carrying the clever
chord progression strums in the
background and a piano adds lit-
tle frills around the edges, but all-
in-all this sound is nothing ground
breaking.
Overall, Sean Lennon is worth
checking out if you’re a fan of the
current indie-with-strings trend. If
not, go and buy yourself Sergeant
Peppers’ and hear what real music
sounds like.
Francesco Padormo
Poor Sean Lennon; no matter what
he does, he’ll always be compared
to his father. It’s inevitable. What
makes it worse is that he also looks
and sings like him. Even though I
acknowledge his misfortune, I can’t
help but fall into the same trap.
While I’m listening to the song,
thoughts of how John would
improve the song niggle at
the back of my head. I feel
terribly guilty, because
in essence this is a
good song.
Lennon’s vo-
cals initially
sound weak,
but soon
find
their
Rihanna is 3 singles into a moder-
ately good sophomore effort and
it's beginning to show. It's not that
we're tired of seeing the Barbados
beauty writhe around on a beautiful
beach (we can’t get enough of that)
but the single quality has dropped.
We Ride sounds at home on the
album but isn't really strong enough
to go it alone.
S.O.S (Rescue Me) turned out to
be the heavy-hitting club stomper
and Unfaithful fulfilled its objective
as the pretty, intricately-crafted yet
mature ballad (with a very clever
use of murder as a metaphor for
cheating) and this all makes We
Ride seem, well, pretty boring.
Let’s put it this way, it’s the not-so-
attractive one nobody wants but the
guy with a girlfriend ends up pair-
ing off with as a favour or good deed
to his mates. Definitely second rate
compared to its predecessors but
seeing as the chart is a bit barren
at the moment it won’t have much
trouble climbing to a respectable
top 15 position.

Kelis ft. Nas
Blindfold Me
(La Face)
HHHHI
In late 2003, Kelis joined forces with
her then fiancé, Nas, and blessed
us with the wickedly sexy groove
that is In Public.
Kelis rarely ever repeats a trick,
but now married, Mr and Mrs Jones
are giving us a second glimpse into
their kinky games for her second
single, Blindfold Me, from her
fourth LP titled Kelis Was Here.
This track has 'Kelis' written all
over it from the weirdly pitched
introduction to the blazing synth
effects. Nas does his thing and
lays down a mean verse near the
end and there we have it – prob-
ably not as radio-friendly as
her competition (Beyonce's
next UK single, Irreplaceable
or Rihanna’s We Ride) but
this track will not need to be
re-worked for the club.
The formula is familiar
but still exciting and the
absence of the Neptunes
on the credits confirms
that although they were
a big influence on her
sound, she without
doubt owns it.
Jemil Salami
fine. It's the kind of thing their con-
temporaries in the indie folk scene
have achieved time and time again
with little effort. However, it leaves
me begging to see someone like Ar-
chitecture in Helsinki get as much
hype as these guys have, because
the Magic Numbers really don't de-
serve a lot of the praise.
