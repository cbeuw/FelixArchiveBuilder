Best of
the rest
Pleasure. Frisson. Excitement. If
you’re after the ride of your life, then
what will you feel? Unfortunately,
probably not what was experienced
at the opening of ‘Fairground:Thrill
Laboratory’.
Tha Dana Centre, the adult
only bar and discussion forum on
Queen’s Gate, is holding a three
week event to explore our fasci-
nation with thrill, via the medium
of the fairground ride. Over the
course of the three sessions, the
themes ‘Pleasure’, ‘Frission’ and
‘Excitement’ will be subjected to
the rigorous testing of the ‘Thrill
Laboratory’.
The event kicked off last tuesday
with a multimedia investigation
of how we experience ‘Pleasure’.
The Staff of the Dana centre have
transformed their premises into
an approximation of a fairground,
complete with live DJ, bright lights,
and fast food canapes (mini burg-
ers, hot dogs and fish’n’chips!)
Bizarrely however, one’s enjoy-
ment of a sneaky toffee-apple is
soon disturbed by a balloon wav-
ing, white jumpsuit-sporting ‘Thrill
Technician’, exhorting you to have
‘fun’, or later, to pull funny faces
(terrified, surprised, thrilled). The
emphasis this evening was on
interaction,including a ride on the
fairgound ride ‘Miami Trip’ hooked
up to videolink and heart monitor.
However well intetioned, this par-
ticlular reviewer did feel slightly
like she’d stumbled into a primary
school popuated by 30-something
science nuts.
The main attraction of the event,
apart from the enormous ‘Miami
Trip’ parked outside, was a hand
picked selection of academics,
each giving a short presentation
on ‘Pleasure’. At 10 minutes long,
these were perfect for an evening
audience, long enough to inform,
and even to entertain, but short
enough to prevent thoughts stray-
ing back to the bar. Subjects covered
included the relationship between
Pleasure and Crime, and whether
or not machines and robots can
experience emotion. Most interest-
ing however was Claire O’Malley’s
talk on our interpretations of facial
expressions, and how easy it is to
confuse surprise and fear.
The Thrill Laboratory is an ambi-
tious event, not un-beset by techni-
cal problems and unsmoothed edg-
es. Once these teething problems
have been outgrown, this event
should mature into a fascinating,
and even fun take on our hedonistic
pursuit of thrills.
Thrills and spills
SKA trekking across the universe
Galileo used his telescope to tell
us that the earth went round the
sun, and in doing so, fundamentally
changed the way mankind thought
about itself. In our lifetime, astrono-
mers are preparing for another rev-
olution, this time from the world’s
largest ever telescope, planned for
operation in 2020.
The SKA (Square Kilometre Ar-
ray) offers exciting possibilities,
enabling us to see further into
space than ever before. We may be
able to finally uncover the secrets
of the structure of the universe and
search for life on other planets.
Surprisingly, this revolution may
come from an area of barren or-
ange soil in the outback of Austral-
ia. Mileura station in Western Aus-
tralia has recently been selected,
along with another place in South
Africa, to be a possible site for the
telescope. These desolate areas
have been chosen as they are dry,
have clear skies and are far from
the interference of radiation from
modern civilisation.
“This is a very large project in-
volving 55 institutions in 17 different
countries,” says Professor Richard
Schilizzi, the International Director
based at the SKA headquarters in
The Netherlands. “With this tel-
escope we will be able to go back
to more than 90% of the age of the
universe.”
SKA will be a radio telescope
with a collecting area of one million
square metres – equivalent to 200
football pitches – making it 50 times
Felix talks to International SKA Director Professor Richard Schilizzi about a new variation of space invader
more sensitive and 10,000 times
faster than current telescopes. Ra-
dio telescopes collect waves emit-
ted by radio sources, usually via
large antennas or dishes.
Like the rings of a cosmic tree
trunk, radiation from the deepest
parts of the universe can give us
information about its history. The
SKA will be able to examine radia-
tion from the gases which became
the first stars and galaxies. This
will give us a clearer picture of how
the universe evolved.
Ancient information from the very
first stars, galaxies and black holes
will be recorded for the first time,
giving us a clearer picture of our
beginnings. “The big bang was 13.7
billion years ago,” explains Prof
Schilizzi. “We will be able to look at
this very early stage, perhaps with-
in a billion years of the big bang,
when the universe began to form.”
As well as this early history, sci-
entists hope to be able to peer into
a crystal ball and see where the uni-
verse is headed. The Array will help
to explain the mysterious ‘dark en-
ergy’, a force pushing the cosmos
apart at an ever increasing speed.
By observing the distribution of the
universe’s most abundant element,
neutral hydrogen, the SKA will look
at the role and properties of dark
energy, and help us make sense of
this strange force.
Alien life forms should also be-
ware – SKA will be searching for
you. Astronomers will use the tel-
escope to look for earth-like planets
around other suns and radiation
from extraterrestrial life in our gal-
axy. For the first time, we will be
able to detect tiny amounts of radia-
tion from other planets. Signals as
small as those emitted by TV sets
or radar equipment, for example,
could be detected. “SKA will be able
to pick up radars from other civili-
sations close to us,” says Professor
Schilizzi. “It is certainly something
that we are interested in.”
Scientists are also keen to use
SKA to extensively test Einstein’s
famous Theory of Relativity. The
behaviour of dead stars, or pulsars,
will be analysed and compared with
Einstein’s predictions. This will
provide with information to test
the validity of Einstein’s theories.
Professor Schilizzi is confident that
SKA will pick up around 20,000 pul-
sars and that “at least one example
of a pulsar will be around a stellar
black hole, which can be used for
testing Einstein’s theory in a strong
field case”.
The SKA is a massive project,
costing over 1 billion euros. But it
has the potential to answer most
of the outstanding questions in as-
tronomy today – from alien life to
the origins of the universe. Con-
struction on SKA is planned in 5
years time, once the large group
of collaborators from Argentina,
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
France, Germany, India, Italy, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland,
Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the
UK and the US decide on a final
design, funding and a site for the
project.
It is likely that SKA will raise
more questions than answer them.
Professor Schilizzi refuses to spec-
ulate on what SKA could reveal, but
he does say that “all we can say for
the moment is that every telescope
[that was a major advance] found
things that were absolutely not pre-
dicted ahead of time”. We wait with
bated breath.
