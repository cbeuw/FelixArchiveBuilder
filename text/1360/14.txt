“What do I do,” asked Dr Vineeta
Gupta, an Indian physician work-
ing in Punjab, “when a 40-year-old
woman with learning disability and
bitemarksacrossherbodypresents
to me with HIV because she was
raped by her father as a child? Do I
offer her condoms? Encourage her
to be faithful? To be abstinent?”
“What do I do,” she asks again,
“when a 14-year-old sex worker in
Mumbai tests HIV positive, hav-
ing been sold to a brothel at the
age of 9? Do I say to her it was her
choice?”
Dr Gupta argues that the cur-
rent response to tackling HIV is
insufficient, even harmful. This was
hardly the line touted at the XVIth
International AIDS conference in
Toronto, in celebration of the re-
newed resources for the struggle
toward universal treatment.
Any newcomer to the pandemic
could be forgiven for presuming

might as well have discovered the
HIV pathogen themselves, given
the airtime they received. Those
most implicated by these discus-
sions, those with HIV themselves,
were only noticed by their absence
on the main stage.
There was, however, one plat-
form, courtesy of The Lancet medi-
cal journal, aboard a boat on Lake
Ontario – perhaps a necessary free-
lance for a message that in contrast
left no slack for complacency. Those
on that boat heard from grassroots
initiatives – those with HIV and

Scaling up of HIV/AIDS treatment
The world of scientific ethics is un-
predictable, argumentative, and
always, always relevant. Wednes-
day’s meeting of Imperial College’s
student Pugwash society exempli-
fied all these qualities.
The speakers were to be Profes-
sor Peter Zimmerman, professor of
Science and Security at King’s Col-
lege Department of War Studies,
and Dr Rebecca Johnson, Execu-
tive Director of the Acronym insti-
tute for Disarmament Diplomacy.
“Weapons in Space” was the topic
up for debate, on the arsenal of sat-
ellites that may soon be surround-
ing the Earth. But as things turned
out, these potential superweapons
were overshadowed by events at
ground level, as on Monday, North
Korea detonated what they claim to
have been a nuclear device.
The two speakers were inundated
with requests for comment on the
North Korea situation from nation-
al and international news channels,
and Dr Johnson was unable to take
part in our discussion. However,
Prof. Zimmerman, who has previ-
ously served as Chief Scientist at

mament Agency, kindly made time

their own health in marriage
than the financial risk of being

working with HIV directly in India
and sub-Saharan Africa.
Education is constantly being
touted as the answer but what effect
does it have for woman who have
no choice? Consequently, education
must be about empowerment, not
just cucumbers and condoms.
What does education do for these
women who have no choice? What
choice is there for them amongst
abstinence, being careful (mar-
riage), and contraception? No such
simple mantra can hope to break
the restrictions of liberty that dis-
able women in these countries from
agency for their own health.
HIV thrives in the thick of a com-
plex knot of problems. It is irrefu-
tably a shameful situation in our
world today, where 38 million live
with a debilitating and fatal illness
simply because they cannot afford
treatment. Our only experience of
fighting HIV successfully comes
from the sterile laboratory condi-
tions of the wealthy west. The risk
of interventions worsening inequal-
ity, and the risk of losing current
drug artillery to resistance, cannot
be underestimated.
Why is it only on Northern soil
that we entertain a bottom-up ap-
proach to eradicating disease that
is community-specific, and patient-
centred? What excuse can be found
for not offering the holistic medi-
cine we consider necessary to those
across our national borders?
David Barr, a long-term treatment
advocate and educator, argues that
lack of resources is not the problem.
Nor is it a lack of interaction from
Northern Rich to Southern Poor.
There is such interaction on a
massive scale but it is tied to “prof-
it, market development, war, and
arms procurement”. The U.S. will
spend $1 trillion of its $2.25 trillion
total government outlay in 2007 on
war while international develop-
Could increasing the incidence of resistance do more harm than good by making drug therapy useless?
The possible detonation of a nuclear weapon in North Korea is cause for concern
around the world together, Pug-
wash can search for peaceful so-
lutions to conflicts. As many Pug-
wash members hold positions as
advisors to governments, the ideas
formed through the discussions
and conferences can quickly find
their way into international policy.
The organisation’s influence was
acknowledged in 1995, when it was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
International Student/Young Pug-
wash encourages students to think
beyond the facts and concepts of
scientificstudy,andconsideritsrea-
sons and implications. The Imperial
College branch organises talks and
debates with leading scientists in
order to raise awareness of impor-
tant issues, and holds a yearly ex-
hibition of ethical careers, demon-
strating how scientific knowledge
can be responsibly applied.
We will be rescheduling our
planned “Weapons in Space” debate
to later this term, and delve further
into the politics of North Korean
nuclear testing. There is also an
informal session on the history and
foundations of Pugwash on the 1st
of November, chaired by Pugwash
historian Sandy Butcher, which will
be an excellent introduction to the
organisation for anyone interested
in the ethical implications of being
a scientist.
would not be productive within the
evening’s setting. Those with opin-
ions on U.S. nuclear policy will have
to wait for future meetings to air
their views. In discussing the test-
ing of nuclear weapons Pugwash
is returning to its roots. The inter-
national Pugwash Conferences on
Science and World Affairs began in
1957, when the scientific commu-
nity was coming to terms with the
shocking reality of the atomic bomb.
Today, Pugwash considers the ethi-
cal aspects and global impacts of all
areas of science, from agricultural
biotechnology to the distribution
of HIV medication, though the pre-
vention of armed conflict takes top
priority.

He focused on the facts, analysing
the earthquake to reveal the size of
the bomb, and concluded that, if in-
deed nuclear, it was ‘the worst first
test in history.’ Whether this is re-
assuring or terrifying is up to us to
decide.
He also speculated as to the cur-
rent state of North Korea’s nuclear
arsenal, pointing out that nobody
wastes a bomb on a test unless
they have several more to spare.
Although he describes himself as a
“Democrat in exile”, Prof. Zimmer-
man preferred not to discuss the
U.S. nuclear arsenal. When inter-
rupted with questions, he explained
