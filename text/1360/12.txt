Weighing in on the veil issue
W
e are forever at
war. The end of
the cold war era
meant jack, there
is always another
enemy to fight, more lands to be
re-conquered, the grip of power
ever cemented. I firmly believe
that what we now see in Britain,
and indeed the rest of the world, is
the beginning of a subtle process
that will in the end lead to the ma-
ligning of Muslims being deemed
a “radical fifth column.” The view
may very well prevail that not only
can they not be trusted, but they
must be watched over and defend-
ed against with vigilant suspicion.
Anyone who believes in different
core values, dress or systems of
governing life is a danger to all of
society, where even one of these
individuals has the ability to cause
irreversible torment.
Jack Straw is not an idiot, he
didn’t get to holding cabinet posts
by being an idiot who lets his
mouth run, nor when he lets it
run on consecutive days is he una-
ware of the fire he is flaming. The
same applies to John Reid. Both of
them gave the same message but
with different force, i.e. we have
a segregationist community that
is a danger to us. Neither could
be farther from the truth. In my
experience most people at uni-
Omar Hashmi urges students to communicate with each other and suggests that
there may be something more to recent comments made by Government Ministers
versity have friends from many
backgrounds, especially Islam,
so if we all do our bit and actu-
ally talk to each other I’m sure we
would work out that, actually, we
get on quite well! We don’t have
to go to the exact same events all
the time, but when we meet each
other we break those “common
courtesy” barriers and really un-
derstand what the other person is
thinking about. It doesn’t matter
if she has a face veil on because
(guess what), you can still talk to
her! And as long as the content of
the conversation is conservative,
suitable and necessary it should
be fine. How many women wear-
ing niqab have we seen having
trouble at schools, hospitals and in
their jobs? If they were isolation-
ist why are they even there? Let’s
admit it – some of us just don’t like
the way the other person looks,
without even trying to get to know
them. Why are people linking the
veil to isolationism? I don’t need
to be naked to talk to you.
To what end does it serve mak-
ing some look different, isolated,
weak and suspicious? One possi-
ble explanation is that it is a mas-
sive distraction. As I live in Essex,
I know some of the people that
attended the community meeting
with John Reid over “watching
the signs of extremism.” The one
I
felt compelled to write hav-
ing read the article by See-
ma Pattni (So you think you
want to be a doctor?), in last
week’s Felix, in order to pro-
vide something in the form of a
response.
Miss Pattni appears to be under
the illusion that all other medics,
at whatever level of their career,
are mercenary, money-grabbing
creatures, concerned only with
personal profit, giving no thought
whatsoever to the patients whose
care we are entrusted with.
If this is the case, I would like
to ask why we give up six years of
our life training to become doc-
tors, when we could do another
degree lasting, say four years, and
come out of it driving faster cars,
wearing nicer clothes, and gen-
erally earning more money than
we will do when we graduate as
doctors?
Assuming that Miss Pattni is a
third year medic herself, she will
have by now completed about
eight weeks of clinical training. I
feel that this is an inadequate pe-
riod of time in which to cast such
far reaching aspersions on an en-
tire profession; in my own clinical
experience, I have seen consult-
ants close to tears over the loss of
a patient (incidentally, on the very
Friday when the original article
was published), and have been for-
tunate enough to work with some
of the best consultants this medi-
cal school has to offer, who have
worked their hind legs off in their
respective field to further enhance
the care available to their patients
(Prof Gazzard et al, pioneers in
the field of HIV medicine).
Yes, no one will argue that the
NHS is in a mess, but this does
not mean that the people work-
ing within the organisation are
not doing their best with the ever-
increasingly limited resources
they have to work with. On the
contrary, I have spoken to at least
one consultant who has gone on
record and publicly denounced
the way that the system is head-
ing towards compromising pa-
tient care in the press. Tell me; is
that the action of a self-obsessed,
greedy charlatan?
No profession is perfect, and no
one will pretend that medicine is
any different. There are the oc-
casional bad eggs, and no doubt
there are some people at Imperial
studying medicine for the wrong
reasons. I am well aware that
medics are not held in the high-
est regard by many at Imperial,
but I hope that people reading
this can read past the fact that it
is written by a medic proud of his
school, and see that I am merely
trying to illustrate an alternative
viewpoint.
I think someone needs to wake
up and smell the proverbial cof-
fee beans. Banter is part of hospi-
tal life. Consultants earn respect
through years of hard work, and
they in turn have endured the rib-
bings afforded to them by their
seniors. For what it’s worth, I per-
sonally come from a working-class
family, and the reason I am doing
medicine is to try and do my bit to
make hospitals a less scary place
to be for all those who I come into
contact with.
Miss Pattni, no one is holding a
knife to your throat forcing you to
stay in medicine. If it’s not what
you expected and you are not
enjoying it, then leave, you know
where the door is.
I hope that over the coming year
your experiences and opinions
change for the better, but if they
don’t then there is little point in
continuing in a system within
which you are not comfortable.
Believe me, there are plenty more
people waiting in the wings to fill
your boots, and the majority of
those will be caring, good-hearted
individuals who will also do their
best to ensure that whenever they
are given charge of someone’s
care, they will fulfil that duty to
the utmost of their ability.
Sorry to knock you off your ped-
estal, but we, as a profession, do
care.
Yes, I actually do want to be a doctor
point that all were in agreement
over was that time and again by
virtually ever single person in
that room was that a minister of
government cannot preach about
extremism to people whose fam-
ily they are killing in an illegal
war and occupation in Iraq and
Afghanistan, a new colonial proc-
ess that is the latest in the history
of many in the last hundred years.
Look at the history of virtually any
nation in the Middle East for the
last century and you will find that
the number one force for change
was foreign interests. Remember,
in the beginning, Saddam was
America’s boy against Iran.
I have to conclude that the high-
est level of government is deaf,
dumb and blind to the real reasons
for anger. They really do want a
war, one where the home popula-
tion will be bullied into thinking
what the powers that be want you
to think. So here we are. We know
what is going on. We know we are
the brains of tomorrow. Let’s use
them to actually do something for
once. Event the smallest change
in the attitudes of others will
make an unprecedented impact
against a world engulfed in delu-
sion and murder. Whoever we are,
we must do whatever we have in
our power to stop the madness
from spreading.

M
y pages this
week seem to
have an awfully
serious tone. In
an attempt to
cater for those not particularly
interested in the loftier issues
considered in other columns
I’m going to extol the virtues of
trading in a weekend clubbing
in London for somewhere more
far-flung.
I’m sure most of you are aware
by now that a night on the tiles in
London town can get hideously
expensive. Thankfully cheap air
travel provides a solution. I now
reckon it’s far more cost effec-
tive to fly away after lectures on
Friday for a weekend of carnage
in a city that’s not quite as big a
rip off as this fair town. Uber-
cheapness seems to be most
plentiful in Eastern Europe and
closer to home, well, anywhere
north of Newcastle.
The obvious downside is that
you won’t be treated to any big
name DJ’s but you do have the
added novelty factors of going
somewhere new, mostly the
many different types of people
you just don’t get in London.
Take Glasgow for instance.
Aside from it’s reputation for
drunken violence a friend reli-
ably informs me that a certain
section of the female population
now begin their Saturday night
out an hour earlier so they can
squeeze (take this literally) in
an extra takeaway between the
pub and the nightclub. Isn’t that
splendid? Drink a skinfull, eat
a kebab, attempt to dance off
the kebab in some god-forsaken
sweaty club then replenish your
energy levels with a smoked
sausage supper. I hate to think
what Jamie Oliver would think
of this rather dubious way of
spending your leisure time. And
people still wonder why parts
of Glasgow now have lower life
expectancy than the Gaza Strip?
The entertainment value of this
spectacle of gluttony is almost
worth the trip itself. You could
sum it up in the following man-
ner: return flight £50, 2 nights on
the lash £80, seeing two women
wrestling over the last pickled
onion… priceless!
This might not sound like your
cup of tea but I do recommend
you try and sample some night-
life outside of London. You’ll save
a bit of cash and then perhaps
next time you go out here you’ll
complain less about the prices.
Get on
the lash
