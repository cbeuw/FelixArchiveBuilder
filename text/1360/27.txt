Robin Hood fails to hit the target
The BBC’s latest Saturday night family show takes over from Doctor Who, certainly a tough act to follow
The BBC’s latest flagship drama
Robin Hood rode onto television
screens a few weeks ago. Promoted
with the channel’s prime time cli-
ché as “the one to watch”, it has set
camp in Saturday evening’s fam-
ily friendly seven o’clock slot. The
BBC’s advertising bow had been
targeted primarily at the Doctor
Who audience who tuned in at the
same time for weeks previously. I
wasn’t a fan of the time-travelling
dalek-dueller, so my expectations
were cautious but those clever
television execs also happened to
be superb archers. Who’d have
thought?
After the initial episode I was hes-
itant to write about the program. To
my surprise, it was enjoyable but
the splinters in my bum were sting-
ing from sitting on the fence – I
couldn’t decide whether I genuinely
liked it or not. Robin Hood cantered
along quickly enough from scene
to scene and it was easier to watch
than clubbing one of the sheriff’s
guards over the head with a sword.
As a piece of family entertainment,
there’s nothing more suitable than
a cheeky protagonist battling the
oppressive ruler whilst pushing the
messages of charity and spread-
ing the wealth to the fore of chil-
dren’s minds. My view was delayed
a week before Robin Hood was
trialled again for the dungeon of
condemnation.
The week passed and as I began
watching Jonas Armstrong flex his
string bow as Robin of Locksley
once again, immediately I sensed
a cauldron of contempt bubbling up
somewhere inside of me. The edit-
ing was the first thing that riled me.
Simple shots of Robin’s right hand
man, Much, turning round were
chopped together with three differ-
ent camera angles looking utterly
strange.
In the final scene of the episode
Tom Roberts

Robin improvised using his bow as
a zip line mechanism. The scene
was cobbled together with endless
amounts of different shots thus ru-
ining any sense of excitement or,
more importantly, danger, as our
hero hung statically in different po-
sitions along the rope zip line. Vari-
ous shot changes gave the impres-
sion Robin was in fact gradually
moving back up the rope! One of
three things happened here: either
the sheriff had a tiny castle (which
would also explain why there are
only five guards available to fight
the peasants in the entire fort!) not
just with a moat but actually floating
on a water reservoir rocking Robin
back and forth; or the set was too
small to film an entire shot of this
extremely high risk manoeuver; or
the insurance people wouldn’t pay
out in case Robin went too fast and
smashed through the sheriff’s poly-
styrene faux granite walls. I haven’t
got time to lambaste Robin’s CGI
arrows that magically leave the
bow and suddenly reappear wher-
ever his invisible telescopic sight
points.
The appalling editing wouldn’t
be such a concern if the camera
could focus on more than the very
small handful of locations that
were on show. A few straw huts, a
castle courtyard, a dingy dungeon
and the generic Sherwood Forest
background are already as unwel-
comingly familiar as the stench of
someone doing a you-know-what
in public toilets – hold it till home,
people. Usually it’s possible to see
past technical shortcomings and
find salvation in the story and act-
ing; after all, high budget television
has always lacked the finesse of
dramatic cinema – the CGI artists
on Doctor Who braved the TARDIS
themselves fetching their anima-
tion equipment from the 1980s. But
once again, Robin Hood fails miser-
ably when it comes to the players
and script. Armstrong’s cheeky
nature soon slips into smugness
and the audience is left wanting to
break Robin’s ruddy bow over his
skull. Keith Allen is well cast as
the Sheriff but let off the leash and
descends into a sarcastic fool who
never really feels like he is going
to prevail against the renowned,
worshipped and almost holy Robin
Hood. By far the worst character
is Much. Only ever used as a de-
vice for woeful humour that makes
Friends look original, at one point
he charges into a dungeon exclaim-
ing: “This is a rescue! And we are
undetected!” Cue the sound of
shouting guards in the background
and a joke Joey Tribbiani would be
ashamed of. Even more appalling
script writing is when a group of
outlaws are discussing the Sher-
iff’s ransom clause for capturing
Robin Hood – cutting out people’s
tongues. The outlaw declares that
it would be funny if “instead of ‘the
cat got your tongue’, ‘the sheriff got
your tongue’” would be a hilarious
phrase. Some outlaws begin ex-
amining their nails for dirt whilst
others scan the sky for cloud cov-
erage, whilst behind the cameras
the crew are probably dying on the
inside because this script was com-
missioned when they themselves
could have written a better script
than this steaming turd on a piece
of Kleenex.
It’s unclear where my epiphany
came from regarding this program.
Having previously enjoyed it, I
now can’t stand to endure it. Once
I started picking, the bogies soon
fell out of Robin Hood’s nose. This
judge’s verdict on Robin Hood? The
dungeons are out of the question. A
prompt trip the stocks of disgrace
for the actors followed by a severe
quartering for the editing team
and a hanging of the script writers
should suffice. For the good of all,
the rest of the series should be axed
immediately.
Jonas Armstrong in Robin Hood: Unfortunately that’s a string bow and not razor wire.
Gordon Ramsey gets a roasting
Last week I had the pleasure, and
luckily friends in high places, to see
Have I Got News For You recorded
live. Actually, that’s a lie. I just have
friends quicker than Paul Merton’s
cutting wit when it comes to obtain-
ing extremely high-demand tickets.
I’ve always enjoyed Have I and
Ramsay’s television programs have
featured numerous times in this
section, so when the hard-arsed
chef’s name was called out along
with Peter Serafinowicz of comedy
Look Around You fame, I was feel-
ing pleased at the prospect of an
entertaining evening with a panel I
respected.
Before cameras began rolling,
Ramsay promised the entire audi-
ence dinner and wine at Claridge’s
should he make six mistakes. Be-
fore he’d even finished the intro-
ductions the audience members
each had four eager fingers and a
thumb raised.
The three Michelen star winning
chef was clearly nervous, fidget-
ing in his seat, twiddling his pencil
and thanking the audience for their
support.
It wasn’t long before Ramsay’s
infamous temper began to boil and
the contestants cottoned on to this
faster than you can fry an omlette.
Paul Merton was the main culprit,
interrupting Ramsay regularly
whilst he read from the autocue.
By this point, we were all imag-
ining perusing the à la carte Clar-
idge’s and picking the most pre-
tentious dish possible. Whether
Ramsay was genuinely concerned
with our pipe dreams or not was
unclear, since he continued to re-
assure us we would be tucking into
his fine gnosh whilst at the same
time there was an impression he
was attempting to win our support
against his four adversaries.
Merton pushed Ramsay to break-
ing point and he retaliated nam-
ing him a “c**t” before adding a
further insult suggesting if Merton
was so hot, why wasn’t he sitting in
the host’s seat? Game on. Ramsay
was like a lamb to the slaughter.
Merton and his teammate Andrew
Neil launched into a tirade of jest-
ing, ribbing Ramsay about Jamie
Oliver, Anthony Worrall Thompson
and whatever else caused a re-
action. As expected, Merton was
too sharp and Ramsay was look-
ing jaded. Merton made the valid
point that he’d being “doing this
for years” and that if he came into
Ramsay’s kitchen, he wouldn’t be
cheeky about making a shepherd’s
pie.
My respect for Ramsay was taint-
ed ever so slightly after walking out
of the studio. Part of his ability to
acheive such a high status came
from his ball breaking nature, but
perhaps even his aren’t made of
steel.
I feel that the televised footage of
Have I only partially conveyed the
tense atmosphere and that a lot of
the time the editing rendered cer-
tain jokes and comments to appear
out of context. But I respect this
would have been a mammoth task.
Now, to phone Claridge’s.
If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Gordon Ramsey
takes the flak presenting Have I Got News For You.
