TELEVISION
Once Upon a
Time: Season 2
Sophomore Slumps
John Park Television Editor
Previously on Once Upon a Time;
characters from the most beloved
fairytale stories were brainwashed,
ripped away from their home the
Enchanted Forest, and forced into
a modern-day hellish locked down
town called Storybrooke run by the
evil witch queen and self-appointed
mayor Regina (Lana Parrilla, still
looking as dark and controlling as
ever) who wished to punish every-
one for lifelong feuds she had with
various people. As more of the char-
acters’ complex, intertwined past
wasrevealed,themoreenrichedeve-
ryone’s background story became.
With enough flashback sequences to
explain and unmask various people’s
true intentions, Season 2 was setting
up as though the residents of Story-
brooke were finally ready to move on
with their lives.
With a flash of mystical-looking
purple smoke, magic re-entered Sto-
rybrookeintheSeason1finale,along
with everyone’s memories, and soon
after we find that the inhabitants are
rightly out for blood: Regina’s blood.
But hold on, we’re not just interested
in Storybrooke here.
Back we go to the magical fan-
tasy kingdom to be introduced to
Princess Aurora (Sarah Bolger), aka
Sleeping Beauty, who, as her name
suggests, doesn’t do anything, Mulan
(JamieChung),akatheChinesePrin-
cess, who you’d think would be able
to put up a decent fight, but doesn’t,
and Prince Philip (Julian Morris), aka
Aurora’s boyfriend, who’s as useless
if not more so, than his narcoleptic
girlfriend. These are the good guys,
although at times it’s hard to see how
exactly they contribute. The new bad
guys? Cora (Barbara Hershey), Re-
gina’s witch mother who’s twice the
bitch her daughter is, and Captain
Hook (Colin O’Donoghue) - these
twoareplottingacomeback,eagerto
transport themselves to Storybrooke
to wreak havoc.
With two parallel narratives to jug-
gle, did we really need a third? Yes,
we absolutely did. Piling on to the
overlong, overly complicated struc-
ture, the writers clearly felt there was
a need to link everyone to everyone
else, making Lost seem like a trivial,
small-scale drama. With season 1
the characters, along with the audi-
ence, had no idea who they were.
Now with everything restored back
to normal, as well as the audience
getting a firm grasp on who’s loved/
kissed/betrayed/killed whom, the
writers could have dialled it back on
all the highly irrelevant flashbacks.
The show never seems to know
when to leave the past alone. It
would appear Regina and Snow
White (Ginnifer Goodwin) are con-
stantly trying to kill each other over
what feels like a hundred years, with
Charming (Jos80h Dallas - dull,
corny, and hardly ever heroic) pop-
ping by for a few showdowns; but
that’s not all, Regina’s past with Cora
complicates things, and so does the
entrance of Snow White’s mother.
Regina has a past connection with
Captain Hook, he holds a grudge
against Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Car-
lyle), who has a thing for Belle (Emi-
lie de Ravin), who is also a target of
Hook, Belle also met Mulan and Red
Riding Hood in the past, etc, etc. You
think you get the full picture? Look
again,andyou’llrealiseaslongasthis
show goes on, you’ll never know for
sure just who is involved with what
when and where. Whereas season 1
took very neat, clever approaches to
linking various characters together,
now everything seems far-fetched
and a touch desperate in an attempt
to squeeze absolutely everyone into
the plot.
Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison)
and her mother Mary Margaret/
Snow White have some quality
mother-daughter bonding session
when they inadvertently find them-
selves away from Storybrooke, al-
thoughaftersomehorrendouslybad,
childish “action” scenes they’re back
where they belong united with their
family; which is when they really
start laying on the cheese. The whole
“I see good in you”
, “there’s good in
everyone”
, “you have a good heart”
“be a good person no matter what”
angle grows more tiresome than
Glee’s endless weekly message of “be
yourself”
, as residents of Storybrooke
show they need a big reality check
when it comes to life in general.
On the plus side the one character
the show could do without, Rumpel-
stiltskin/Mr Gold, has every chance
to flourish in his self-centred, duplic-
itous schemes. Although standing
by his side is the irritating Belle, who
acts as the lead spokeswoman of the
“be good” campaign.
Cora and Hook, who are up to
no good, add some fresh dynamic
into the otherwise dull narrative.
Hershey absolutely nails her role
as she channels hints of her similar
“mother-from-hell” character from
Black Swan, and O’Donoghue shows
he’s more than just a pretty-face eye-
candy with a different accent for the
ladies who make up a large percent-
age of the demographic.
It’s a show full of ups and downs,
but given the abundance of material,
it really should be better. Be bold and
kill off a few characters, less focus
on the past, more driving forward
with the present storylines, and who
knows, some flashforwards, which
served Lost so well during its mid-
series struggle, might do some good
for a series that is growing stale very
quickly. The season 2 finale promises
adventure into a new realm, with a
super-villain (who can fly, who can
fly, who can fly) who is bound to be a
cunning, conniving man-child (hint,
hint). So here’s to hoping some mag-
icwillbebroughtbackintotheworld
of OUAT.
