nocturnal wanderings
underneath Somerset
House, to the burgeoning
popularity of Secret
Cinema’s awe-inspiring screenings,
you’d be forgiven for thinking that the
traditional theatre format is dead.
But this year sees the return of
Punchdrunk, the company that
started it all, as they bring their
immersive world to London for their
‘Hollywood Fable’ he Drowned
Man. Punchdrunk’s founder, Felix
Barrett, became an early champion
of ‘promenade theatre’ when he
founded the company in 2000, and
since then they have been taking over
abandoned buildings, making visitors
don black masks, and leaving a trail of
glowing reviews in their wake.
he Punchdrunk formula is a
relatively simple one; a building
is converted into an interactive
theatrical space, and visitors are
invited to wander around, explore
the environment, and - driven by
their curiosity - discover what has
happened. In this case, the company
inhabit an abandoned Royal Mail
sorting oﬃce just outside Paddington
Station, and have transformed it into
‘Temple Studios’, a 1960s ﬁlm studio
with a sinister underbelly. Stripped of
their belongings - phones and cameras
are forbidden - visitors are given
masks that obscure their identity
before entering the service lift, and
being taken down into the bowels of
the ﬁlm studio.
“The company stress
that The Drowned
Man is a show that
should be explored
alone - whether by
choice or by force”
he ﬁrst surprise comes before
we have even left the elevator, as the
attendant splits our group into two,
dropping half oﬀ at one ﬂoor, and
taking the rest of us to another level.

Man is a show that should be explored

Once we have been freed from the
elevator we are allowed to wander
around their creation. One half of the
building is made up to look like the
town around the studios, including a
forest, a saloon, and a cinema where
the horror classic ‘Eyes Without a
Face’ plays silently, while the other
half of the building is the studio itself;
a world of seedy dressing rooms and
resentful production artists.

between the cast members, the
audience begins to pick up the plot; a
modern adaptation of Woyzeck, Georg
Buchner’s classic tale of jealousy,
power, and murder, he Drowned
Man tells two parallel stories: outside
the studio gates William watches as
his wife Mary is seduced by Dwayne
- after catching them in the act,
William kills Mary in the wilderness.
Meanwhile, inside the studio, Wendy
is shooting a ﬁlm and suﬀering from
violent hallucinations, and when her
husband Marshall falls in love with
the studio’s queen bee Dolores Grey,
Wendy murders him. hese two tales
intertwine, and loop back around
each other, with parts being repeated
throughout the evening, conjuring
up an unnerving atmosphere of fear,
paranoia, and confusion.
However, while the atmosphere
may be intuitive to those attending,
the plot proved diﬃcult to penetrate.
Punchdrunk doesn’t make things easy
for the viewers, forcing them on a
wild goose chase around the studios
in order to track down the fragments
of the story, meaning that most people
will not see all parts of the production.
Combine this with minimal dialogue
and a large dose of interpretive dance
choreographed by Maxine Doyle, and
you have a pretty impenetrable story.
I must admit that the plot didn’t
make much sense to me until I read
the programme in retrospect. Whilst
in a traditional theatre performance
such a confusing plot would go down
like a lead balloon, in Punchdrunk’s
world it is the experience that matters,
and what an experience this is.
he set design team, led by Felix
Barrett, form the cornerstone of
Punchdrunk’s spectacle; quite literally
thousands of props have been brought
in to transform the abandoned
building into the desolate studio.
he themes of decayed Americana,
combined with the masks, give the
whole thing a Lynchian air, and the
attention to detail makes me feel like
I’ve stepped into an actual ﬁlm. From
vast forest wilderness to love letters
hidden in drawers, it feels like nothing
has been overlooked, giving every
object a sense of importance. his is
spectacular, but slightly overwhelming
- you could easily spend a whole day
just looking through the rooms, never
mind following the story.
Being a relative late-comer to the
Punchdrunk party, I don’t know how
their previous productions have
diﬀered to he Drowned Man, but I
do get the sense that the shows have
lost some of their surprise element.
It is clear that a large proportion of
the people at the show have been to
a Punchdrunk experience before -
determined not to miss anything,
they chase the actors around in packs,
making some scenes impossible to see.
“combine minimal
dialogue and a large
dose of interpretive
dance and you have
a pretty impenetrable
story”
Perhaps the company are over-
ﬁlling the space - and who can blame
them when the ﬁnancial status of
British theatre is considered - or the
anonymity provided by the masks
allow members of the audience to
live out their anti-social, voyeuristic
fantasies, but the behaviour of those
watching ruins some of the magic.
Some of the best experiences I had in
the show were the ones where there
were very few people, and the most
memorable part for me was watching
a shrouded ﬁgure perform a strange
ritual in a tiny chapel. When you
watch a scene like that, it feels like
you have stumbled across something
hidden, that many other people will
miss, and these experiences are few
and far between.
While previous Punchdrunk shows
have met with near-universal acclaim,
this show has left the critics and
audiences more divided, and it is not
hard to see why. A dazzling level of
detailinthesetisbelittledbythelackof
attention to the audience experience - I
get the feeling that this is the company
at their most introspective, and it
could be argued that this is theatre
at its purest, where the participants
play their parts irrespective of the
audience. It should also be noted
that, while any review of a piece of
theatre relies upon a single person’s
experience, with this show that is
intensiﬁed; it is entirely likely that I
had an experience not only slightly
dissimilar, but probably completely
diﬀerent to some other viewers - such
is the nature of Punchdrunk. But at the
heart of this production, underneath
the stunningly sumptuous production
design, lies an incomprehensible plot
and a rather uncomfortable viewing
experience. I would recommend
going simply for the experience - I
leave the building feeling bewildered,
astonished, and ever so slightly
Punchdrunk.
