Hangzhou
Hangzhou is the capital city of and
largest city in the Zhejiang Province,
Eastern China, with 3.56 million
people living in its six urban core
districts. Lying on the Hangzhou Bay,
just southwest of Shanghai, Hangzhou
has great economic power. It has
been one of the most renowned and
prosperous cities of China since Qin
Dynasty, due in part to its beautiful
natural scenery. Hangzhou is at
the southern end of China’s Grand
Canal which extends to Beijing.
he city ﬁrst appeared in written
records as Yuhang, meaning ‘Yu’s
Ferry’, and was incorporated into
the Chinese empire as a part of the
Kuaiji Commandery during the
Qin Dynasty. In 589 CE the city
was renamed Hangzhou, and a city
wall was constructed two years
later. In 923 CE Wuyue Kingdom
was founded, and for the ﬁrst time
Hangzhou had become a capital of a
regime. Hangzhou was also the centre
of politics, the economy and culture in
Southern Song. It also gives Hangzhou
the prestigious status of being one of
the Seven Ancient Capitals of China.
We cannot talk about Hangzhou
without mentioning West Lake,
a freshwater lake located in the
historic area of Hangzhou. he lake
is divided by the Bai Causeway, Su
Causeway and Yang Gong Causeway,
which made signiﬁcant contributions
to Hangzhou’s prosperity. Marco
Polo once came to Hangzhou and
famously praised it as city of heaven.
here are numerous temples,
pagodas, gardens, and artiﬁcial
islands within the lake. It was made
a UNESCO World Heritage Site
in 2011, and was described as “an
idealized fusion between humans
and nature.” Almost all of the natural
parks and museums are free to
visitors from all over the world.
The West Lake
It was a lazy, breezy autumn afternoon.
he blue ﬂagstones were still a little wet
after the light rain at noon. he smell of
perfumehungintheair:osmanthuswas
blossoming. Hangzhou, the great city,
was like a young graceful lady. A thin
layer of fog penetrated above the West
Lake, as if the elegant lady was wearing
a veil. Small boats scattered on the lake
and dangled gleamingly in the fog.
Sometimes, big dragon barges passed
by before disappearing back into the
mist again. On the horizon, continuous
hills merged with the sky and the
lake. Willows kissed the water. A few
dilapidated lotuses were whispering
about how they had just culminated
the summer. Crewmen and teahouse
clerks were calling for business.
Hot spring water ran into a glass. he
green tea leaves opened their curled
bodies, stood up and danced in the
water. Tiger-dug spring with Dragon
Well tea: the most perfect match in
Chinese tea history. I held the glass and
tasted a drop. A fresh smell tinged my
tongue, and the hot steam blurred my
glasses. I just closed my eyes, to feel the
vitality and the spring locked within.
Pieces of sweet Osmanthus cakes,
lost words, and fond memories were
with me throughout the afternoon.
Hangzhou is my beloved hometown.
I sometimes think it is not blood in my
vessels, but the water of the West Lake.
I had been told countless fairy tales
about the West Lake since I was a little
girl. he most popular one was a love
story between a mercy snake banshee
and a human. he broken bridge on
the West Lake was where they met,
although it has not been broken down
until now. I guess it is not the bridge,
but the heart that broke, as the snake
was not permitted to be with a real
man. In the end she was locked under
a tower, the Leifeng Pagoda, and
separated from her husband forever.
When I grew up, I had read many
poems about Hangzhou and the West
Lake: great poets have not only given
us beautiful poetry, but have kept
the West Lake a unique treasure that
will continue inspire for generations.
Night began to fall. Small boats were
back and streetlights were on. Bars,
cafes, clubs and teahouses began to
get busy. As I was cycling around the
lake, a musical performance began:
the Impressive West Lake by Yimou
Zhang. Music fountain performances
were bravura and passionate as well.
Hangzhou: her beauty, elegance
and vogue sweep the world from
her feet, and he West Lake is a
forgotten pearl from the heaven.
