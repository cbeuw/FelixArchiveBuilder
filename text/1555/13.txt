f your most recent memory of
Charles Saatchi is seeing the
photographs of him in the Daily
Mail allegedly strangling his
ex-wife Nigella then you are
deﬁnitely missing out.
Despite his unfortunate relationship
issues, the Iraqi born advertising
mogul and art collector has an ideally
located gallery that deﬁnitely warrants
a wonder.
Best known for his eccentric and
somewhat controversial taste in art,
Saatchi’s current exhibition ‘Paper’
may seem a little backward in nature,
but in a world of ever advancing
technology and digitalisation it is
refreshing to see such a basic material
used in such diverse array.
Known by many as a shy and
reclusive man, Saatchi has the power
to make or break a contemporary
artist’s career. He helped discover the
likes of Damien Hirst and Jeﬀ Koons
as well as giving considerable support
to Tracey Emin, all of whom have had
massive success in the contemporary
art scene.
He is a man who knows what he
likes and this is made apparent in his
exhibition that includes the works of
43 artists spanning 10 galleries.
Highlights from the exhibition
include Eric Manigaud’s Portrait
Clinique (graphite on paper) – a
collection of life-size drawings
documenting photographs taken in
a medical facility in Weilmünster,
Germany. hey poignantly depict
physically and mentally ill Jewish
patients who were starved or sterilised
under the Nazi regime. Although
harrowing in nature, Manigaud’s
exceptional skill brings the drawings
to life helping to provide an insight
into this terrifying world.
Another memorable piece is
Marcelo Jácome’s Planos-Pipas #17,
literally meaning ‘Kite-Planes’ in the
Artist’s native Portuguese. Taking up
an entire room, it seemed to spread
weightlessly across the space whilst
most certainly shouting “look at
me”. A bright and colourful piece,
constructed from bamboo triangles
and tissue paper, it was structured yet
chaotic and deﬁnitely drew the most
attention from visitors.
Worth a mention, solely for the
fact that you cannot walk around
the exhibition without noticing it, is
Lerma and Madera’s Bust of Emanuel
Augustus, a giant sculpture made
of scrunched, coloured paper. “Eye-
catching” to say the least, but at over 8
foot high how could it not be?
It could be a little uninteresting
at times, but all in all this exhibition
deserves merit for the fact that such
simple materials were manipulated to
create such inspiring pieces.
he gallery is ideally located on the
King’s Road, Chelsea, just a 20 minute
walk from the South Kensington
campus, and its large, bright and
airy rooms provide an ideal escape
from the frenzy that is London. Some
may ﬁnd it a little pretentious, but
whether you are an art fan or just
want something to do to occupy a
lunch break, head down to SW3 for an
interesting afternoon out.
“For here they talk of nothing but
Figaro. Nothing is played, sung or
whistled but Figaro. No opera is
drawing like Figaro. Nothing, nothing
but Figaro.
”
Modest Mr Mozart himself wrote
this shortly after the premiere of Le
Nozze Di Figaro, and though it sounds
rather big headed, it still holds true
today. Le Nozze di Figaro is one of the
most performed, established and well-
loved pieces of opera repertoire and
the current Royal Opera’s production
(the fourth re-run of the 2006 version)
perfectly showcases this.
he plot is a mix of two classic
narratives: the clever servant and
stupid master, and the husband and
wife deceit themes, with a good
sprinkling of bawdy humour, cross
dressing and proposed weddings.
Sounds like a panto, right? Wrong.
Set to Mozart’s score, this stiﬀ,
predictable sounding story rollicks
along, by turns funny, gripping and
in many cases truly touching, making
for an enjoyable and gripping evening
out.
he opera starts with Figaro and
Susanna, the servant couple, preparing
to marry, struggling with the dowry
money and the Count’s pervy lust for
Susanna. he Countess meanwhile is
feeling lonely and abandoned and to
add to the mix, a teenaged servant
is running around the castle getting
into steamy situations with the maids.
Figaro, with the help of Susanna and
the Countess and the hindrance
of the Count and many secondary
characters, manages to wriggle out of
all the situations he gets into, and the
story ends with a triple wedding and
the Count reconciled and in love with
his wife.
Le Nozze di Figaro is based on the
Beaumarchais’ “La folle journée, ou
le Mariage de Figaro”, a play that
received much attention on account
of the censorship it was subjected to.
Embarrassing monarchs was a bit of
a sensitive subject in the 18th century
(though possibly Prince Harry is
trying to revive this) and the play’s
emphasis on Figaro’s intelligence
was considered inappropriate. he
operating version played down Figaro’s
socialist impulses, thus allowing it to
evade censorship, though a few royal
eyebrows were raised at the moral
content.
Despite this, Figaro has remained
indelibly connected to the French
revolution. he real strength of this
production is its ability to transcend
all of Figaro’s cultural and historical
baggage and to revive it as what it was
originally intended to be: a funny yet
touching human story.
Add this to the Royal Opera House
incredibly high production standards
