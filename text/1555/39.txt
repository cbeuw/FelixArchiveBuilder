This week you are idly watching
those 30 second Sabb videos in
the Union, when one suddenly
locks eyes with you, and begins
to mouth “help me!” You prise the
frame from the wall and find that
they are actually trapped behind
the glass, made to forever act out
30 seconds of repeated, horrific
awkwardness. They cry softly
upon their release.
This week you visit the Library,
and accidently stroll in the
Science Museum bit on floor
three. Unsure of whether you
are still in Imperial or not, you
slowly take out your “magic
wand” and gently rub it along
the bookshelf, moaning. After
no-one blinks an eye, you de-
cide you are definitely still at
Imperial.
This week, you decide to go
to your first ever sports (CSP)
night. Go you, young fresher,
making friends with other peo-
ple who like the same physical
activity as you- this is going to
form the best foundation for ev-
erlasting friendship! One forc-
es a pint of Jager down your
throat whilst another cheers,
and you puke repeatedly and
responsibly through Thursday.
This week marks the second
week into your love affair with
your rice cooker, Wilson. After
realising that dry humping him
would compromise his ability to
pass the rigorous electrical safe-
ly tests for appliances in halls,
you stop. The urge doesn’t go
away however, so you transfer
into Fisher instead and hump to
your heart’s content.
This week you are awarded the
Nobel Prize in the new category
of being a complete dick. As
the Wanker Laureate that you
now are, you decide to raise the
price of fizzy drinks by 3p on
campus, and then use your new
fortune of penny coins to jam
all the keyboards in the library.
Chaos ensues.
This week you are at the Union
pub quiz, and some undergrad
tries to tell you that the largest
human organ is the liver, not the
skin as you well know by having
completed a legit degree in this
sort of shit. You mouth off at him,
feel triumphant and then sud-
denly depressed as you realise
you are a postgrad in FiveSix-
Eight on a Tuesday night.
This week, you finally move into
your tiny, decrepit London flat,
with two Polish students you
found online. They buy a live eel
to fatten up in your bath in time
for Christmas and you shower
with the gelatinous monster
circling your feet. You decide it
could be worse- you could be in
Fisher Hall.
This week you go to the RCSU ball
and are given liquid nitrogen ice
cream. In your alcohol induced
haze, you accidently drop the
cone on your thermometer and it
slowly freezes into an icicle of per-
petual hardness. You get the RCS
President to rub it warm again,
and he obliges, being the great
Union hack that he is.
This week the ecologists bug-
ger off to Uganda for a field
course, so Facebook becomes
devoid of certain egotistical
morons mouthing off about the
apparent ever-traumatic faults
of the Biology department. You
welcome the change whole-
heartedly, and privately hope
that someone gets trampled by
an elephant.
This week you wake up to
find you are Miley Cyrus. This
horoscope ends here as that is
horrific enough for one week.
This week your housemate has
sex with a screeching female
student, who thinks it is appro-
priate to shout Pokémon names
every time she orgasms. You
start using it as a verbal version
of the new Pokemon game, and
endeavour to catch them all. She
catches herpes instead and no
longer visits, and sadly you don’t
get your second gym badge.
This week you wake up to find
you are a humanities student,
and cannot look at yourself in the
mirror as you prepare for your two
contact hours of the month. You
discuss your feelings, deduce
meaningless facts from nothing
and read the Daily Mail. You pass
your course with flying colours
and wonder why you tried to
study science in the first place.

ollowing the recent incident
at LSE Union Fresher’s Fair,
at which the Atheist Society
was asked to remove their
T-shirts, Imperial College
Union has formally banned anybody
wearing an LSE Union T-shirt.
A spokesperson for Imperial College
Union said that the t-shirts could
oﬀend others by creating an oﬀensive
environment to those students who
believe in the right to free expression.
Our source said,
“We had received a number of
complaints from our students. he
LSE Union students were asked to
cover the t-shirts in the interests of
good university relations, but they
declined.
Imperial College Union is committed
to promoting freedom of expression
it was felt that these LSE students
were undermining what should be
a welcoming and inclusive student
union.”

Cameron Decides Against Major
Cabinet Reorganisation

S
tating that it was already
“exceptionally tidy”, Prime
Minister David Cameron
took the decision not to
change anything in his
cabinet. Saying that his beautiful
set of George Osbournes still
complimented the old family William
Hagues perfectly, Cameron left the
senior government ministers safely
under lock and key. “I mean, who
would risk moving the precious
Philip Hammond?” said Cameron,
“Especially given how good it looks
next to my matching Michael Goves”.
Whilst he accepted the need to clean
from time-to-time, the Prime Minister
was unwilling to take everything out
just to get to the musty corners. “I
don’t want to break anything and
anyway, several of Ian Duncan Smiths
are stuck there”. He did, however,
get rid of his old Michael Moore and
replaced him with a vintage piece of
Alistair Carmichael. “Nothing
screams ‘Scotland’ more than a classic
Carmichael”. He added “To be honest,
I’ll just wait until next year and get it
professionally cleaned on expenses.
hat’s deﬁnitely safer”.
Leader of the Opposition, Ed Mil-
liband was more ruthless, however.
In getting rid of his Diane Abbott
and throwing out his rusty old Liam
Bradys, he managed to buy in a shiny
new Rachael Reeves and stunning
pair of Andy Burnhams. “Sometimes,
you’ve just got to through the old stuﬀ
out, even if it does hold a lot of senti-
mental value”.

Union Tells NUS “We’ve Moved On, Stop
Calling”
A
After a surprise
encounter in the
street, the National
Union of Students
told Imperial College
Union: “You’re looking well”
ICU, after pausing to remember their
name, replied: “hanks, so are you”
“I’ve actually got a lot societies now,
but you know, I’m not ready to settle
down”
Apparently not... (Sooo two thou-
sand and late)
he NUS then asked if ICU was will-
ing to come back, but ICU pretended
to receive a phone call from its mum
and crossed the road to safety.
“Pheeww” the Union exclamed
whilst double-checking the NUS had
gone before puting the phone away.
