Ever wanted to take part into a
continent wide battle for control
of an entire planet? PlanetSide
2 (released November 2012) the
revamp of the succesful MMOFPS
PlanetSide allows you to do exactly
that! It revolves around the control
of the mysterious planet of Auraxis.
Featuring a gigantic map, which
is divided into hexagonal areas
where the three diﬀerent factions
vie for control. While in eﬀect you
can spawn anywhere on the three
continents, you will only be wanting
to spawn in to where the actual action
is taking place. his is easily done
using the direct spawn in (which has
a 2 minute cooldown), or spawning in
from your local base. his allows for
quick entry to gaming which is quite
satisfying. he maps themselves are
beautifully crafted and even on the
lowest settings, quite detailed. his
makes ﬂying, driving or just walking
through the world very enjoyable.
When joining the game for the
Like a good meal, steak as the main and planets on the side
ﬁrst time, you are confronted with
a choice of a faction that you will
represent. here are the Terran
Republic (the industrial faction,
which uses bullets and heavy metal
stuﬀ), the New Conglomerate (a
freedom ﬁghter faction, using a
mish mash of technologies) and
the Vanuu Sovereignty (the high
tech faction, which utilise laser and
plasma tech). While gampeplay
is virtually the same within the
three factions, the developers
have made enough changes to
look and feel, that you do feel like
there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
he diﬀerent classes themselves are
also really fun, and each individual
one makes for a completely diﬀerent
gaming experience. I myself
preferred the Light Assault class
due to the addition of the pretty
useful jetpack! However due to the
modiﬁability of each weapon and
ability, it is possible to play one class
almost like another and do so quite
successfully. he most fun class is the
MAX class, which is basically a Iron
man type suit which you can add
diﬀerent loadouts to. his suit is quite
overpowered, meaning that if you do
it right you can mow down enemies!
he gunplay in this game is quite
realistic, meaning that for the bullet
based guns you will have to account
for gravity and the like (however
the laser based tech of the Vanuu
does not have this factor). However
I found that due to the size of the
map as well as the large amount of
people on the server at the time
that it was actually quite laggy. hat
meant at some points I would die
even after I had killed my opponent.
his was very frustrating, and even
setting the graphics settings to the
lowest didnt seem to solve that
problem. I really hope that this is
solved soon as possible, because
when the game play is actually
lag-free it is really good and fun.
However there are pros to there
being so many players on the server.
Since this game is a multiplayer
game, there is the reasonable
expectation that you will be spending
quite a bit of time playing online with
others. Howevever it is perfectly ﬁne
playing solo, and it will not really
impact your gaming experience. On
the other hand, it is when you join
a squad that stuﬀ goes really well.
Usually you will be added to a squad
on a random basis (e.g. some random
dude will invite you to join a squad),
and the quality of them can vary but
when it goes well, it goes really well!
his game follows the fremium
model, meaning that you can play
for free, however have to pay for
additional content. he developers
have pledged that you will not be
disadvantaged if you do not pay, as
the content that costs is for the most
part cosmetic/time saving. At no
point in the game did I really feel that
I needed to pay money, and it did
not really hamper my ability to play.
his is a well crafted game that
is quite fun, and the fact that you
can enjoy the most of it for free is
excellent. If you are a fan of Halo
type games, you should really look
into this. I mean, you might as well!
he Lara Croft we see in this game is
very diﬀerent to how we might usually
perceive her: conﬁdent, strong,
comfortable with diving into dark
caves or putting bullets into enemies.
Instead, our main character starts
oﬀ as anxious, afraid and averse to
violence. his game takes us back to
the beginning of the metamorphosis
from Lara Croft to the Tomb Raider.
Initially the game has cinematic
scripted sequences that can be
frustrating to sit through with
minimal involvement, but it sets
the scene very well and allows you
to understand that you are about
to play a very diﬀerent game to the
one you might have expected. Lara
is attacked, stabbed, exposed to the
harsh elements and the game focuses
on her pain and fear. She shivers,
sobs, and throws up as she tries her
best to survive her situation, and this
makes her more than a character in a
game. It makes her human, and our
sympathy goes out to her. If you fail,
there are graphic and gory sequences
of her death, further increasing
your incentive
to keep
her alive.
However, as
you play on she becomes stronger,
both emotionally and physically,
and the game slowly turns into a
more familiar adventure that is
exhilarating, albeit a little typical.
Weapon and skills upgrades are
translatable into good advantages
in gameplay, and not prohibitively
difficult to acquire. Traversing the
areas is fast-paced, and ﬁnding
‘tombs’ where you can solve puzzles
and earn goodies is rewarding
and fun. he main downsides to
gameplay are the occasional times
where you do not
have total
control of Lara
during certain
scenes,
and feel like
you’re just
holding the
controller
while the
script
plays
out.
Second, the
‘survival
instincts’
mode
where interactive objects are
highlighted take some of the
fun out of the game as you
immediately
know where
to go and can piece
together solutions to
puzzles without much
thought (though it is
optional).
he graphics and cinematics
of the game are beautiful.
here are a multitude of
caches, documents and
relics scattered
around the areas and it’s
actually a visual
pleasure to look
for them. hey also help
bring out the archaeological side
of Lara Croft, which is who she is at
heart, even from the beginning of
the game. he overall plot of Tomb
Raider is also fairly engaging, though
the supporting cast are not quite as
well-developed as Lara (something
the game attempts to ﬁx by having
Lara randomly ﬁnding letters that
reveal their back-stories).
he completion of the story is
as anticipated, and not entirely
satisfying. However, once it’s
over, there are still mini-quests to
complete and various bits and bobs
to go ﬁnd, which you will actually
still want to do because it’s quite fun!
Overall the main strength of this
game is the peek into Lara’s early
history and the vivid scenes of her
development into the Tomb Raider,
but it has enough of the good old
shooting and puzzle-solving to please
the more traditional gamers too.
Tomb Raider 2013 was released
on 5 March 2013. It can currently
be bought for around £9.99.
