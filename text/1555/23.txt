Dark Days in Downton Abbey
Latest episode demonstrates how not to tackle a rape storyline
At the beginning of this week’s
Downton Abbey, there was a
warning for “violent scenes
which some viewers may ﬁnd
upsetting”, leading me to wonder
what the cause could possibly be.
Given the most signiﬁcant crisis
thus far this season has been a
matter of inheritance tax, it was
diﬃcult to imagine anything
too disturbing: an emergency
over the spillage of hot tea,
perhaps? A tear in Lady Mary’s
dress which leaves her unable to
meet some viscount or another?
Yet after an otherwise standard
episode, featuring a tense
scene involving a misplaced
gramophone, and a truly heart-
stopping moment in which a
footman drops a jam jar, the ﬁnal
few minutes depicted a fairly
graphic rape scene. As the rest of
the household sits watching an
opera singer perform, downstairs,
ladies’ maid Anna is dragged
screaming by her hair, and raped
by a guest servant staying the
house. It isn’t an easy scene to
watch, but it was more than just
the content of the scene that left
me feeling uneasy, leaving me
to question whether storylines
such as these really have a place
in a show like Downton Abbey.
Regular viewers of Downton will
know that it has a track record of
making miserable things happen
to its characters. he third series
had one of the main characters
dying in childbirth, which was
shortly followed by the Christmas
special in which the heir to the
estate is killed in a car crash whilst
his wife is giving birth (the take-
away message being, apparently,
don’t get pregnant in Downton).
Even Anna’s character has already
had her fair share of diﬃculties,
with her husband Bates being sent
to prison for a crime he didn’t
commit, so perhaps this latest
twist shouldn’t come as a surprise.
However, storylines about rape
have become something of a lazy
plot device, an easy way to shock
audiences and get viewers talking.
I’m not suggesting that the
subject of rape shouldn’t be
tacked in TV programmes.
Only, it has to be handled with
a degree of care and sensitivity
above most other topics, given
that a not-insigniﬁcant number
of viewers will have been aﬀected
to some degree, and I’m not sure
Downton, which is little more
than a gloriﬁed period soap
opera, is best placed to do that.
he thing is, there’s no way
of dealing with the issue with
the gravitas it warrants, whilst
also following the otherwise
mundane storylines in the show.
No matter how much it likes
to pretend otherwise, Downton
isn’t a gritty, high-brow drama. It
gained its fans through the will-
they-won’t-they romance of Lady
Mary and middle-class solicitor
Matthew, the sharp witticisms
of Lady Grantham (played by a
fantastic Maggie hatcher), and
the glorious fashions of the early
twentieth century. It’s therefore
not surprising that viewers were
shocked after the episode aired on
Sunday evening; ITV apparently
received over 60 complaints
regardingthescene,withheadlines
about the episode appearing in
many newspapers the next day.
he fallout from the rape will
presumably be one of the themes
of this series, with Anna so far
determined to keep her assault a
secret from her husband, fearing
he will be sent back to prison
if he attempts to take revenge.
Although it’s too early to tell, it’s
not a stretch to imagine that the
main purpose of Anna’s rape will
be to add a new source of drama
to the show, in particular to force
a confrontation between her
husband and her rapist. his sits
even more uncomfortably when
considering the other storylines
of the series so far, which
include Lord Grantham being
condescending to his daughter by
expressing doubt in her ability to
manage the estate, and the Abbey’s
youngest resident, Rose, portrayed
as ﬂighty and reckless after daring
to dance with a man before asking
his name. Sometimes, Downton
veers dangerously between
evoking a rose-tinted nostalgia
for ‘the olden days’ and pointing
out, heavy-handed, at how far
we’ve come since then. It’s easy,
whilst watching, to get a self-
congratulatory sense of ‘but look
how things have changed’ (see
also: Mad Men), and yet rape,
sexism and debates over women’s
sexuality are hardly issues
relegated to the past. And there’s
enough gratuitous rape in ‘edgy’
drama as is, without the likes
of Downton deciding to join in.
For once, there appears to be
a consensus that, this time, the
writers have gone too far. It seems
this may be a misstep from the
show’s creator, Julian Fellowes;
by attempting to be hard-hitting
and controversial, the show has
alienated its core viewers. It will
be for them to decide whether
the show is worth saving, but
until then, let’s hope Fellowes
has learned from his mistake.
