FRIDAY 11 OCT
The Platonic Merits of a Religious Education
I
mmanuel Kant, perennial
philosopher of the 18th
century, once made two key
distinctions. Firstly, objects
act in accordance with ﬁxed
rules. he latter distinction clariﬁed
that rational agents (you and I)
formulate actions with ﬂippant
regard to mere conceptions of
those rules. One would therefore
conclude that certain elements
of humanity prove to be ﬂawed.
Many would concede that Roman
Catholicism, in recent decades,
serves as a ﬁtting allegory. Be it
the sex abuse scandals portrayed
to perpetuate ad inﬁnitum or the
Vatican’s dogmatic condemnation
of contraception, the church has
received its fair share of criticism
(as has religion as a whole).
It must be made clear, however,
that these seeds of imperfection
were not sewn in the classrooms of
Roman Catholic schools; indeed
I believe that faith-oriented
academic institutions share a
common thread, having been
buﬀeted, tarnished and ultimately
engulfed by recurrent waves of
vitriolic demagoguery, which
frequently (and often surprisingly)
remains unchallenged. Having
been educated in a Catholic
Grammar school I feel that the
dualism between a religious ethos
and education can stimulate
plurality, empathy and tolerance in
the mind of a student.
Many claim that faith-oriented
schools are, paradoxically,
aligned (particularly in England
& Wales) with elitism. Anecdotes
of the middle classes forcing their
children to attend mass and other
religious services in an eﬀort
to secure a place in desirable
schools are innumerable. I will
concede that some parents may
do so in a vain and conceited
manner, exploiting the educational
conduits provided by religion.
Despite this, parents cannot
be condemned for harbouring
aspirations for their child. It
might furthermore be debated
that the skewed abundance of faith
schools in “aﬄuent” areas is but
one of a plethora of imperfections
in the approach of Government to
education as a whole.
One might care to consider focus
as the desirable crux of a religious
education. In context of Roman
Catholic schools mathematics,
science, humanities and languages are
bolstered by an ethos of morality and
religiosity. Students are encouraged
to challenge the Raison d’être for both
their hopes and eﬀorts. On a regular
basis in England and Wales, parents
send their children to Catholic
Grammar schools regardless of their
secular background. For these people
religiosity is no longer the chief focus;
rather, it is the moralising framework
awarded to their children, which
may in turn act as a cornerstone for
the evolution of their academic and
moral framework.
I attended a Saint Patrick’s,
Downpatrick in the North of
Ireland. People regularly claim that
the regional school system (based
on Catholic and State schools) has
sectarianized and corrupted the
minds of our youth, concentrating
the embattled mentality between
nationalist and unionist factions. In
line with my experience I vehemently
disagree with Rory Fenton’s view.
For many, like it or not, the
justiﬁcation for our school system is
a question of identity over religiosity
or faith. he nostalgia invoked
by my time at school makes it
diﬃcult for me to fashion a cogent
counterargument…but I stand
resolute on a number of points.
Primarily, I ﬁnd myself at
Imperial College London as a direct
consequence of the ethos of my
school. My teachers convinced
each and every pupil (in many cases
subconsciously) that their endeavours
were for the betterment not only of
themselves but their family, friends
and (most ﬁttingly) their community.
his extended to interfaith
relationships.
Secondly and to conclude, I
suspect that integration does not
need to be institutionalised or
labelled and ﬁnd nothing sinister
in that. While my reservations may
be platonic, I am convinced that
the retention of a religious school
system can aid conﬂict resolution
in Northern Ireland. We must be
careful not to debase the complexity
of the problems in the North to
religious disparity. If things are to
move forward all parties must work
together. his will fail if we are not
conﬁdent in our own creeds, values
and beliefs. In the ﬁtting words
of Seamus Heaney, valued Nobel
laureate, we need ‘room to rhyme’.
Note that I disagree with Mr.
Fenton’s depicted demographics of
Belfast.
P
ublic services should
be open to all people,
regardless of their
beliefs. hat so simple a
statement should need
to be shouted is madness and yet
this is exactly what is needed in
the UK. he truth is that for all our
advances in other areas of human
rights, when it comes to religious
and belief discrimination in public
services, the UK has scarcely
changed in 100 years. Nowhere
is this clearer than in our state
schools.
Religious schools make up a third
of all state schools in the UK and
are granted astounding privileges.
If they are oversubscribed they
can ensure that only pupils of a
certain religion, or more precisely,
pupils with parents of a certain
religion, can attend. hey are also
allowed to discriminate in the
hiring of teaching staﬀ. Not just RE
teachers; history teachers, science
teachers, geography teachers... Such
grotesque discrimination would
be illegal in any other workplace
except, of course, in a church. he
principle of employing people
according to their ability is thrown
out of the window.
Religious schools are also deeply
socially divisive. Giving schools the
ability to select along arbitrary lines
means they use this as an excuse to
select wealthier pupils. Middle class
parents are more able to “game” the
system in knowing which religious
buttons to push and being more
likely to be free on Sundays to go to
church. Remember I said that a third
of state schools are religious? Of
the 20 most socially exclusive state
schools in the UK (comparing pupils
who receive a free school meal to
those who do in the catchment
area) 18, that’s 90%, are religiously
selective.
Lastly there is the issue of
preventing children from mixing
and meeting with children from
diﬀerent backgrounds of their own.
Philosopher A C Grayling likes to
say that the argument against faith
schools can be summed up in two
words: Northern Ireland. I went to
a Catholic school in Belfast. Despite
this being a majority Protestant
city, I didn’t meet a Protestant
of my own age until I came to
Imperial, aged 18 (incidentally, he
is now the editor of this paper).
Northern Ireland’s devisions go
much deeper than our schools but
to argue that deliberately keeping
the two communities apart hasn’t
contributed to tensions and lack
of empathy between them is
ludicrous. In England, too, cultural
tensions are heightened by “faith
schools” which can de facto select
according to race. he current
government allowing new Muslim
and Evangelical Christian “Free
Schools” can only be a recipe
for disaster when it comes to
integration.
While my children won’t be
brought up in any religion, I want
to see them educated alongside
Jewish kids, Muslim kids,
Christian kids, Sheikh kids and all
other kinds of kids. I want their
teachers to be the best teachers
in their subjects, not the ones
who ticked the most denominational
boxes. I want them to learn alongside
poor kids and rich kids. I want them
to be a part of their communities. For
as long as we allow such desperately
divisive institutions as religious
schools to operate, at the taxpayers
expense, this vision of education, this
shared vision, is hopeless fantasy.
Religious schools are an awful idea
and an even worse reality. We are
better oﬀ without them.
