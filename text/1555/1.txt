T
wo of Imperial’s Faculty
Unions, the Royal College
of Science Union (RCSU)
and the City & Guilds
College Union (CGCU)
have recently been involved with
various “mascotry” activities over
the last month. he activities began
when the RCSU President Plabon
Saba was escorted to the RCSU oﬃce
in a slightly inebriated state before
the start of term. One of the escorts,
an engineer took advantage of the
RCSU President’s state and was able
to remove the RCSU mascot, heta
the hermometer, from the oﬃce.
Several days later the RCSU
received a note from CGCU attached
to a bag containing a rubber bolt
with the message: “his is the closest
you will get this year”. Eventually the
CGCU sent a list of ransom demands
to RCSU shortly before the Freshers’
Fair including the donation of £350 to
RAG, for the RCSU President to take
part in the CGCU “slave auction” and
for the RCSU to advertise the CGCU
Welcome Dinner on social media.
During the Freshers’ Fair the
CGCU antagonised the RCSU by
sending people over to their stall
to enquire about the whereabouts
of heta. However, towards the
end of the event a large group of
RCSU Exec committee members
approached the CGCU table in order
to steal the CGCU’s Spanner and Bolt
mascots. he CGCU stand was only
attended by two members of CGCU
which allowed the RCSU to use the
“outnumbering” rule whereby if one
party outnumbers the other by a ratio
of four-to-one the smaller party has
to hand over their mascot voluntarily.
RCSU’s list of demands included
a £500 donation to RAG (initially
£750), a Faculty email from CGCU
apologising for the theft of heta, for
baiting the RCSU with the rubber
bolt, recognising the superiority of
the RCSU and apologising for their
poor defence of the Spanner and
Bolt during the Freshers’ Fair. he
RCSU also demands that CGCU
President Lejon Chua, the CGCU
mascot bearers and the student who
stole heta are all pied for charity,
and that the “thief” also embarrasses
himself at the next RCSU Bar Night.

Unions is slightly overshadowed by
the long history behind the current
versionofhetathehermometer.he
current version of the mascot, heta
IV has remained “inviolate” a whole
(i.e. has never been stolen in one piece)
since its creation in 1975 representing
the longest period an Imperial mascot
has ever been inviolate. However
during the past history of the heta
mascot, if a version of heta has been
“violated” the RCSU committee has
dunked the mascot in Hyde Park’s
Round Pond and commissioned
a new version so that the RCSU
mascot stays “virgin”. Felix awaits
the decision of the RCSU President.
