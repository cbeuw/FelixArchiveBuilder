Teach First – Investing by Making a Difference

Teach First
E
ver since I was little I
dreamed about becoming
a teacher and taking care
of kids within and beyond
a classroom. I strongly
believed that good teachers were
the leaders of tomorrow and that
they were a key element to a strong
society. Ask yourselves this question:
Would you be here without the one
inspirational teacher who believed
in you and pushed you to the top? I
know that I would not. My parents
moved me around a lot when I was
little and I was educated in French my
whole life. When they decided to put
me in an International school aged
sixteen - where the main language was
English - I started to give up on my big
dreams of making it to a prestigious
university in France. I was convinced
that I would never have suﬃcient
grades to apply where I wanted (as
my English was really poor). My
literature teacher believed in me from
the start, pushing me to apply to even
more prestigious universities; they
were not the best in France. hey
belonged to the best in the world.
He was an exceptional teacher, the
kind of person that does not look at
your academic record alone, seeing
much more in you than a nondescript
kid with ‘such and such’ grades.
Somewhere along the line I grew
up, became realistic and went oﬀ to
university convinced that I would
end up working in a fancy corporate
bank like my mother. I decided to
give up on my dream to become, one
day, one of those inspirational people.
Despite this, when you really
believe in something, no matter how
hard you try, you will never be able
to push it away and pretend it does
not exist. I tried to forget about all
this until one day, when I met Sophia,
the Teach First graduate recruiting
oﬃcer on campus at the time. She
seemed so passionate about her
job and Teach First’s vision that
my drive for teaching immediately
resurfaced. Her message was simple:
the British education system is unfair
and children with a disadvantaged
background are clearly left behind
others who are more fortunate.
I could drown you with numbers
to support this claim but let me just
leave you with a few notable statistics:
16% of children eligible for free school
meals make it to university. Contrat
this with 96% of children coming from
independent schools! Really? Teach
First’s mission is to change those
numbers and turn around the current
situation. How do they do that? hey
empower people like you and I to
take action and join their movement.
here are many ways in which
you can participate and make a
diﬀerence. You can become a Brand
Manager like me (and write articles
about your life at 10pm!), apply
for their Leadership Development
Programme (if you are into teaching
or fancy working for their partners
after the programme...or both!).
Furthermore, you can raise awareness
of all of Teach First’s good work.
Do you want to change lives and make
societybetter?Areyouinterestedinthe
corporate world but feel like you want
to do something that takes pecedence?
Take up the challenge. Teach First!

Confessions of a GTA: Part One
I’
ve always wanted to be a
GTA. It wasn’t because they
were doing amazing PhDs on
their own desks, in which they
cured cancer or published
ground-breaking articles which they
presented at world conferences. his
was all pretty cool but actually, it had
a lot to do with them being rubbish
at teaching. As an undergraduate I
saw them turn up late to lectures they
were being paid to help with, chat with
their colleagues and completely ignore
any student of a diﬀerent nationality
from their own. hey would stand
right behind you in an exam breathing
heavily, or when questioned on
how to do the most impossible
problem conceived by man, they
would ask, “What do you think?”
I always thought that it was
startlingly clear that, at this point,
being so confused and exasperated by
this stupid question, that all I cared
about was them telling me what I
should be thinking. If there was one
thing I was going to get right on
my PhD it was being a good GTA.
hus, on my ﬁrst day I duly signed up
forthemostappropriatecoursesformy
skills which all commenced after the
training dates. I carefully considered
my timetable so that I’d have time to
read through all the lecture notes and
do each tutorial from scratch. Feeling
pleased with myself, I headed out for
‘just one pint’ with my new world
famous and cancer curing colleagues.
he next morning seemed
very early... and loud. he e-mail
ping was painfully pitched; the
e-mail turned out to be worse.
“hanks for agreeing to help with my
lessons last night. It is the ﬁrst tutorial
so the students will probably only get
ontoquestions1-6.Seeyouinanhour.”
An hour! Training was in a week!
I clicked on the attachment. Problems
vaguely reminiscent of three years
past appeared on the screen. Well,
the obvious thing to do was neither to
start from scratch nor go through the
lecture notes but to read the solutions
of questions 1-6 on the sheet. hese
seemed fairly self-explanatory
although I placed an asterisk beside
a couple of harder parts for good
measure and ran up to the teaching
room... I only two to ﬁve minutes late.
I was greeted by the overbearing
person who had taken advantage of
my drunken state; they turned out
to be one of my favourite lecturers
and we had a nice conversation
about the summer. I heard a loud
“Harrumph” from behind me. A
number of obscenities occurred
to me as I realised that I had been
caught chatting and rushed over to
my ﬁrst student. He asked me about
something beside which I had placed
an asterisk, which was ideal. At no
point did I ask him his opinion.
Avoiding the chatty lecturer I
circled the room, trying not to stand
behind anyone. I wandered over to
some nice but slightly foreign looking
students, to see how they were getting
on. hey were on question 7, having
breezed through 1-6. I retreated
rapidly to the corner of British
students, who were struggling with all
my asterisked points. Here I remained.
After all they had loads of questions.
GTAing: It seems it is going to be
harder than it looks.

First impressions are probably correct
Take up the
challenge.
