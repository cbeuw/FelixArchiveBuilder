2006 – North Korea’s ﬁrst nuclear bomb test
is met with extremely ﬁrm line from the UN. he
non-proliferation treaty is thoroughly upheld
proving, once again, that international treaties
are ALWAYS highly eﬀective and never bullshit.
1989 – Another UFO lands in Soviet Union giving
unequivocal evidence of what we all suspected:
the Ruskies are all aliens from outer space hell-
bent on spreading pan-global, anti-human ideas.
1979 – Lowest recorded non-tornadic atmospheric
pressure. A fact you’ll deﬁnitely want to repeat all
the time to everyone – with your friends; people
you’re chatting up; bank managers; in-laws; the Pope
etc etc. Seriously, everyone will ﬁnd this fascinating.
1942 – In a coup for world peace/
alcoholics the Soviet Vodka Union establishes
diplomatic relationships with Australfostersia.
1582 – he implementation of the Gregorian
calendar means this week is skipped. I bet you
wish you could skip the miserable, embarrassing
loneliness that is your week. We’ll here’s the truth
– you can’t, you terrible excuse for a human being.
1492 – Christopher Columbus lands in the
Bahamas. he fucking moron thinks he’s in
fucking India. He even failed to realise that if he
was in India (which he clearly fucking wasn’t),
he would be fucking East India. What a fucker.
Theyʼre over 8000 miles apart. I mean who makes
that mistake? Frankly, Iʼm glad they didnʼt name the
Americas after him. Amerigo Vespucci, now thereʼs an
explorer worthy of a large continent. Picture Credit: freeworld-

tating this morning that
“every aspect of your
life is dark, dangerous
and you should be
constantly shitting
yourself” MI5 chief, Andrew Parker,
warned of the general terror of life.
Speaking for the ﬁrst time since
he took over in April, Parker added
that “Terrorists are watching you -
especially YOU - all the time”.
“Be they Islamic, Irish or even
something a bit weird like Chechnian,
they’re all out to get you”.
Whilst the Director General
focussed on terrorism, he also warned
of the numerous other dangers faced
by the British public on a daily basis.
“here’s cancer, thats never very far
away and it’s scary as balls”.
“And then there’s beneﬁt cheats -
those guys will go for you without any
warning”

FRIDAY 11 OCT
Felix Office, Wednesday 9th of
October.
In a coup widely described as
“violent, angry and uncompromising”,
Hangman was this week viciously
overthrown and replaced with
Hangman.
Hangman, along with a large group
of assorted mercenaries, was able
to break through the high security
perimeter set-up around the Felix
oﬃces. After which, Hangman then
proceeded to question all remaining
sub-editors on the whereabouts of
Hangman.
Whilst many were stoic in their
responses to hard-line questioning,
enough information was gleaned to
conﬁrm that Hangman had received
an anonymous tip-oﬀ just minutes
before the arrival of Hangman. It is
rumoured the former sub-editor and
their entourage were able to get out
through a back window and are now
in hiding somewhere on campus.
Hangman declared “peace, liberty
and freedom of expression” for all
writers and readers of Hangman.
Hangman also assured their followers
that [former sub-editor] Hangman
would be “hunted relentlessly” and
be dealt with “ruthlessly” should their
location become known.
However, information has emerged
thatanyoppositiontoHangman’scoup
has been met with brutal violence. his
has inevitably sparked concerns that
coup would merely be replacing one
dictatorial rule with another. When
sought for interview, a Hangman
spokesperson stated “rest assured, all
force used during this liberation has
been directed exclusively towards
“Britain Exceptionally Dangerous And Scary“ Public Warned
Didnʼt he see the fucking
ﬂag?

their day-to-day lives, the director
was keen to emphassis that it’s
“fucking scary out there”.
“I mean, you could just get run-over,
just like that”.
At press time Parker was rumoured
to have sprinted to the nuclear bunker
under GCHQ, irreversibly locked the
doors from the inside and sat their
waiting for the food to run out and for
it all to end.
Meanwhile, this reporter has
protected themselves from the fear
throught the acquisition of a gun.
No World, you put your hands up.

those who deserved it”. “he former
regime must be punished”.
Hangman justiﬁed the bloody
and vicious coup by stating that
Hangman had been a “stooge for the
West” and full of “relentless capitalist
propaganda”. Hangman went onto
accuse Hangman of corrupting the
paper and suppressing its articles.
The Hangman tanks roll into Beit Quad, crushing all who would oppose them.
Stay tuned for more ridiculous crap from the past including
ﬂoppy disks, Simon Cowellʼs haircut and that thing you
used to play with as a child.
