Open letter from RCSU

RCSU President
Open letter from the Royal College
of Science Union
Dear all,
he start of the new term is here and it gives me great
pleasure to see everyone back on campus. And of
course I must not forget to welcome the freshers who
will be joining this brilliant institution and especially
the scientists who are lucky enough to be part of the
best constituent union on campus. Whether you are
old or new, everyone loves a good welcome letter.
For those that do not know, the RCSU is one of the
four constituent unions at Imperial and was founded
by famous Sci-ﬁ writer H.G. Wells in 1881. We exist
for two reason; social activities and representation.
Representation wise, we have oﬃcers that look after
student welfare to help you even out any bumps you
hit during university. here are also year reps and
departmental reps who keep the lecturers on their
toes to ensure you get the world class education you
deserve. he Year rep nominations are currently open
and I would urge the keener ones amongst to get
everyone’s voice heard and stand for election.
University is of course more than just about a degree
and we organize a range of social events such as our
seasonal balls, bar nights, pub crawls, guest lectures
and an essay-writing competition called the RCSU
Science Challenge which boasts a prize pot over £4k.
his year, I am also looking to revive RCS Sports
clubs, rugby and football in particular. I am hoping
that we can re-ignite some of our old rivalries and
put the various trophies behind the union bar up
for competition again. If this is something you are
interested in, please e-mail the RCSU Sports Oﬃce
Oscar Farrell at Oscar.farrell12@imperial.ac.uk.
End of the day, university is what you make of it. he
relationship between the union and its member is a
two-way one. If you don’t put some energy in, you are
unlikely to get a lot out of it. So, get to know the union
oﬃcers, come to the RCSU oﬃce for my weekly drop-
ins and check what we are up to on www.rcsu.org.
uk. Our website is currently being re-designed by our
webmaster Philip Kent and we hope to get an all new
interactive site rolled out in the near future.
he best way to keep in touch is to read my e-mails
and newsletters as they will be full of important tidbits
about what’s happening and the opportunities we
provide for you. I swear they won’t be as boring as they
sound!
Here’s to an amazing year,
Plabon Saha
RCSU President
S
omeone told me today
that you shouldn’t write
reviews of your own events.
I obviously didn’t listen to
their advice; after all, who
can know better what went down at
the RCSU events than people within
the RCSU?! My sincerest apologies
to the other constituent unions
who are obviously lagging behind.
Freshers Fair:
hree words. Wheel of Fortune. You
know how Nando’s always has a prize
wheel at the freshers’ fairs? Well, this
year they weren’t the only one as we
hired in a massive plasma screen and
ran our own giant wheel of fortune.
Prizes included Autumn Ball tickets,
drink tokens, an 8GB RCSU USB stick,
pint glasses, shot glasses, mugs, RCSU
lapel badges and RCSU Scarves. Given
the crowd at our table throughout the
day, it’s fair to say the gimmick was
more than successful, especially when
the CGCU - who were opposite us -
got so mad at their empty stand they
had to keep shouting to attract people.
To top that miserable day oﬀ for them,
we also nicked the Spanner and Bolt!
We also had tons of RCSU sweets
for the masses alongside lanyards,
notepads and the highlight of them
all, RCSU condom cases. hese
double up as a key ring and are a
discreet way of making sure you are
always prepared. We were very happy
to see so many eager faces on the day
and are looking forward to seeing
you all again in this coming year.
RCSU Made in Chelsea Pub Crawl:
We started Freshers’ Fortnight oﬀ on
hursday the 3rd with our trademark
Made in Chelsea pub crawl. As always,
our beloved 1916 Dennis N-Type ﬁre
engine Jezebel was there to transport
freshers from pub to pub. Some would
sayitwasquiteanexpensivepubcrawl,
but with student loan cash spilling
over in everyone’s pockets, there was
hardly a problem with £4 pints for a
night. he night ended at JUJU’s, a
cocktail bar on King’s Street to end
the night on a high. At one point,
MIC stars showed up and decided to
buy everyone drinks at the ba- wait,
never mind, that might have been
me on a diﬀerent night out. Oops.
RCSU Bookshop:
On Friday morning with hangovers
in full force, we set up the RCSU
second hand bookshop in Sherﬁeld
Foyer. he bookshop was an excellent
opportunity for students to buy
second hand books from other
students at a reasonable price. After
a big rush in the morning the rest of
the day was spent quietly behind the
stand by various committee members.
Rumour has it that someone started
to eat their own hands in boredom.
RCSU Tea Party:
he second week of Freshers started
oﬀ in a truly British manner with the
RCSU Tea Party. here were various
types of tea on oﬀer which were
procured from a specialised tea house.
With free scones and cakes on oﬀer it
wasofnosurprisethattherewasagreat
anticipation amongst students. In fact,
a queue built up before the start of the
party and hoards of scientists piled in
as soon as the doors were open. Union
jacks were ﬂying high and the tea
kept ﬂowing as people relaxed after
a day of lectures. Even if they weren’t
awake for lectures, the tea ensured
their evening got oﬀ to a good start.
RCSU Autumn Ball:
Perhaps the most prized event of
them all was the RCSU Autumn
Ball which took place on Tuesday
at Ruby Blue in Leicester Square.
here were 3 free double mixers on
oﬀer alongside a scoop of nitrogen
ice cream. he Ball managed to sell
out a day in advance and there was
great anguish amongst the people
who missed out on the tickets. But
for the people who managed to grab
hold of one before time ran out, they
were in for a treat. he nitrogen ice
cream proved to be very successful as
evident by the long queues that were
forming. Some would say that the
ice cream was so good, it made them
completely forget about the hardships
of grinding a degree out of Imperial.
Priced competitively at £12, the ball
was organized to ensure it doesn’t
cut a deep hole in people’s pockets.
Student drink prices were in full
ﬂow to ensure that even the hard
boozers were kept satisﬁed. It was a
perfect night for the awkward one
night stands during freshers to turn
into a full blown romance. Near
the end, Black Eyed Peas showed
up and started singing. Maybe.
“Iʼve had the time of my life
And Iʼve never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to RCSU”.
Family Bar Night:
In RCSU, it’s all about community and
to ensure the sense of community is
fully integrated amongst the incoming
freshers, a family bar night was held at
the Union Bar on hursday the 10th.
With free drinks on oﬀer for people in
their families, some hardcore family
bonding was deﬁnitely on the cards.
It is deﬁnitely a great start to the year
for us and it’s bound to get better.
RCSU Freshers Fortnight: Legit
review from the RCSU Office
RCSU
TOP: Jezebel, the RCSUʼs Mascot; BOTTOM: RCSU Committee Members
“RCS What?
We donʼt know
who you are!”
If this resonates
strongly with
you, you are
either a) an
engineer, or
b) in need of a
friend
“RCS Ha!” You
say? Then you
must either a)
have Theta,
b) be crying
as you cradle
the empty spot
Spanner and
Bolt used to
reside, or c)
are probably
several
“responsible”
pints down and
raring to go!
