A
s I walk below the
Queen’s Tower, before
an evening in Central
Library, I look up at the
surrounding buildings
(youguessedit…I’macivilengineering
undergrad!) and the environmental
conscience inside me is thinking:
“Whatarealltheseroomsdoinglit-up?
We should be turning the lights out as
soon as students leave their lectures
and tutorials...” Little did I know
that within these rooms, there are
students. Some of them are studying,
but others are doing something
even better! hey’ve just decided
to create a new society at Imperial!
During the Summer Term of 2012,
several Mechanical Engineering
students decided to start the Imperial
College Design Collective. Design was
something that was touched upon in
some of their classes, and actually in
most engineering degrees. However,
students often have to give it a second
priority compared to the wave of
workload of Mathematics, Mechanics,
Dynamics… well a lot of ‘ics’
essentially. hey saw beyond this wave
and realised that their engineering
skills were valued in the design world.
Product design needs people with
hard knowledge to manufacture and
prototype the idea. And in the wide
range of design, there is always a place
fortheideasofpragmaticandeducated
scientists, medics, and engineers.
You’ll ask me: “Why did they call it
the Design Collective?” hat’s quite
simple actually. hese entrepreneurial
students decided that although this
design society was born out of the
MechanicalEngineeringbuilding,they
knew they wanted to involve as many
students as possible from all possible
degrees and backgrounds. hey
wanted a collective of students that
could bring a variety of background
knowledgeandskillsinordertoinspire
each other in the design process!
he Imperial College Design
Collective (ICDC) had an amazing
ﬁrst year following its genesis. Coming
from all over Imperial College of
Science, Medicine and Technology,
and even the Imperial Business
School, 56 members were inspired
by the themes of Enhancing Cycling
in London, Sustainability, Toys, and
Interactive City. Even more attended
the talks by architect Andrew Waugh,
brand designer Simon Manchipp,
engineering designer Peter Childs,
and urban designer Kathryn Firth.
With two oﬃce visits to IDEO in
Clerkenwell and Pentagram in Notting
Hill, members were immersed into
a universe of brilliance in creating
processes, objects, projects that
enhance the human experience.
his year, the committee has
prepared new themes for the
collective to build upon. Some
members may come to an interesting
talk by a guest, others will favour the
Wednesday afternoon workshops,
and some will be privileged with
a visit to a London design oﬃce.
I ﬁrst came to Andrew Waugh’s
presentation of his battle to build the
ﬁrst multi-storey residential timber
building in London, and I recognized
my need for alternate activities to my
degree and sports. I loved attending
the evening talks and being inspired by
the passion of entrepreneurs who used
their educational and professional
background to create something that
they thought could beneﬁt society.
And that’s really why I encourage
everyone to join this energy-fuelled
societythatwilladdaspiceofcreativity
and a dash of entrepreneurship
to your Imperial experience.

STOIC: Imperial’s student run tv station
“S
TOIC, you’re
the philosophy
society right?”
Is a question I
receive many
times throughout the course of the
year. he latest being at Freshers’
Fair while standing in front of a
large AutoCue, professional video
camera and a TV playing a showreel
of our best bits. While I do have a
particular love of 3rd century BCE
philosophy that isn’t what the club is
about. STOIC in fact is an acronym of
StudentTelevisionofImperialCollege,
and that’s exactly who we are. From
our studios in the West Basement of
Beit Quad we write, ﬁlm, present and
produce a wide variety of television
shows that get broadcast online.
Our longest running show is IC
News, which has existed in various
forms for as long as the society has,
but that’s far from all we produce.
Last year alone we had interviews,
STOIC
documentaries, short ﬁlms and even
some Eastern European political
satire. his year is looking even more
exciting than the last, with a few
exciting press opportunities coming
up this term alone. he most popular
show we currently produce is the
infamous Metric Moments videos,
which I’m sure many of you have seen
orevenstarredin.Ifnotthenheadover
to our YouTube to ﬁnd out what some
of the brightest minds in the country
think of the important issues in the
world, ranging from Barack Obama’s
re-election to “brown nipples”,
“cross-fucking”, and “American ‘gine”.
In the Spring term large amounts of
our time is devoted to our two biggest
events of the year; he Big Elections
and the JPR Williams Cup match
at Varsity. For he Big Elections we
produce a live hustings show, where
all the candidates for the sabbatical
positions get a chance to convince
you why to vote for them. Hearing
20 people talk about “transparency”,
“accessibility” and “contactless
payment” never gets old. he JPR
Williams Cup is contested with a
rugby match between Imperial and
Imperial Medicals, and last year we
ﬁlmed this with a large scale 4 camera
shoot for the ﬁrst time. his then got
released as both a highlights package
and a full match reel complete with
excellent commentary from IC Radio.
Getting involved with STOIC is
really easy; absolutely no experience
is required to jump right in.
Whether you’re interested in ﬁlming,
ST IC
presenting, acting, editing, writing
or just want to see what goes in in a
student TV station you’re more than
welcome to join. As well as being
helped to improve in any ﬁeld you’re
interested in you’ll also be able to
get involved with some incredible
opportunities;lastyearwehadaphone
conversation with Sir Roger Moore
while trying to set up an interview.
So if you think STOIC is something
you might be interested in visit
our website at www.stoictv.com or
www.youtube.com/stoictv and you
can get involved with (probably)
the only society at Imperial to have
interviewed Mark Hamill, Carol
Vorderman, and Chuck Norris.
