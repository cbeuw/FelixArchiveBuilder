FILM
Documentary corner: Titicut Follies
Fred Fyles
Film Writer
I
t seems fitting that
Documentary Corner should
end with a beginning. Titicut
Follies is the first film from
director Frederick Wiseman, a
giant in the documentary world,
who stormed into the Bridgewater
State Hospital for the criminally
insane in 1966, armed only with a
camera and a whole lot of chutzpah.
Over the course of 84 minutes,
Wiseman exposes the goings on in
the hospital, from the mundane to
the horrific: we see prisoners being
force-fed, stripped, and relentlessly
taunted by the guards, who are
on the whole indifferent to their
charges’ well-being.
In one horrific scene, we follow
a man back from a shave, who is
mercilessly mocked by the guards,
until he begins to scream at them
in a rage; once back to his cell, he
enters into some kind of trance, and
paces around the room, stamping
down his heels. Cameraman John
Marshall, previously known for his
ethnographic work, takes all this in
impassively and relentlessly.The film
takes its name from the in-hospital
talent show, scenes from which
bookend the film, and are the stuff
of Lynchian nightmare. As the lines
between inmate and guard blur, it
becomes more and more difficult to
distinguish between individuals, the
whole scene spinning out of control
like some kind of vision of hell.
What is astonishing about Titicut
Follies is that it set a pattern for
Wiseman that he has not yet
deviated from. Over a career
spanning five decades, he has stuck
to his signature style: lengthy shots,
no voice-over, no interviews, and no
explanation. While his films may
have gotten longer, he has doggedly
remained faithful to these principles,
resulting in over 40 arresting works,
a large number of which focus on
single institutions: 1995’s Ballet,
which looked at the American
Ballet Theatre; 1987’s Missile, which
investigated the training courses
for ICBM operators; and 1975’s
Welfare, which took place in a single
welfare office.
Through his work, Wiseman
reveals himself as one of the world’s
best editors. Eschewing any notion
of objectivity in cinema, Wiseman
admits that all film will be biased:
‘the editing,’ he says, ‘is highly
manipulative’.Often ending up with
at least a hundred hours of footage,
he will go through it,picking out the
best sections, and cutting it down to
a taut narrative (that usually runs
over several hours).
In Titicut Follies, Wiseman forces
us to ask the question of what
the ethical limits of documentary
filmmaking are. He holds the
camera still for as long as he
possibly can, and then even further,
breaking down the lines between
observation and voyeurism. The
ethics is complicated by the fact
that he only received consent forms
from the guards, and not from the
prisoners, many of whom were not
competent.
Just before its release in 1967, the
government attempted to ban the
film, and in 1968 they succeeded,
making it the first film to be banned
for reasons other than obscenity
and national security. In 1987
inmates’ families sued the prison
after a number of fatalities, and
the prosecution team argued that
releasing Titicut Follies in 1967
would have led to reform.
In many ways, Wiseman reminds
me of Diane Arbus, whose
photographs forced the viewer
to look at something they would
normally shy away from. ‘A lot of
people,’ Arbus wrote, ‘they want to
be paid that much attention. And
that’s a reasonable kind of attention
to be paid.’
Originally trained as a lawyer,
Wiseman’s films stand up for their
subjects, providing individuals with
the means to represent themselves;
in Titicut Follies he attempts to shine
a light in one of society’s darkest
corners, leaving us all enriched.

Editorial:Thanks y'all
A
nd so, we’ve come to
the end, just as every
brilliant film must do.
My year as Film Editor
has provided me with the extreme
privilege of seeing first-hand some
of the amazing, insightful writing
we students are capable of. Over the
last 28 issues, we’ve had numerous
contributors, who have all produced
absolutely incredible work. In no
particular order, I would like to
thank our writers: Tom Stephens,
Ben Collier, Meryl Anil, Thomas
Carroll, Diego Aparicio, Alex Heib,
Cale Tilford, Arnold Duralliu, Max
Lewis-Clarke, Ioanna Morianou,
Jonathan Masters, and Diogo
Miguel Geraldes – you guys have
all made my job worth-while, and I
thank you from the bottom of my
chilly celluloid heart.
Over the last year we’ve reviewed
85 films (really, I’ve counted!), from
the incredible (Carol, The Witch,
Youth, and Anomalisa are all worth a
mention) to the awful (here’s looking
at you Gaspar Noé). A common
topic in film journalism is whether
or not we are currently experiencing
a ‘golden age’of cinema; I would just
like to say that there are so many
amazing films being made right
now – from shorts to features, from
dramedy to documentary, from the
UK to the Philippines – that there
has never been a better time to be a
lover of film. In a city like London,
with the BFI and ICA right on your
doorstep, there is no excuse for not
getting involved.
This is the last piece I will be
writing in this year’s FELIX, but
we will be returning, inevitably, in
the new academic year (although
we will be losing our amazeballs
Editor-In-Chief Grace Rahman,
who is moving on to join the Press
Association and the wild world of
professional journalism). And, we
will be looking for a couple of new
Film Editors to join the team! As
well as getting to work alongside a
great team of writers, copyeditors,
and section editors, you will get
the opportunity to go along to
press screenings, drink some of
that free wine, and develop your
love of film. If you’re interested,
or you’ve got any questions at all,
then please send along an email
to film.felix@imperial.ac.uk – we’re
waiting to hear from you.
