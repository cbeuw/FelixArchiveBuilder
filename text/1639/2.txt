o gang, and thank you
for tuning into my final
editorial. Sweet! You
know that picture on the
right isn’t even of me. It’s a Getty
stock photo of 'Happy Mixed Race
Female Outside Berlin Dancehall'
that I stole from the internet.
What a year man – we’ve had
some scoops, some scandals, and
lots of great pieces this incarnation
of FELIX, not least this issue’s sex
survey results,the resurrection of our
gaming magazine, Another Castle,
and various nuanced, delicate and
shouty end-of-year reflections in
the comment section. I hope you’ve
enjoyed reading it as much as I’ve
enjoyed making it, because the bits
that weren’t so traumatic that my
brain forced me to forget them (I
hear this happens in childbirth too)
were great. I do not remember term
one.
My biggest thanks go to the haters:
those mansplaining commenters,
the Islamophobes, and best of all
the men who sat me down and tried
explain sexism to me. Bless your
cotton socks, ass-hats.
Big love also goes to anyone who

has pity-faved my late night GIF-
enabled Twitter breakdowns and
weaker Instagrams. I see you.
Heart emojis to everyone who
wrote for us,edited a section,and the
guy who came to the office because
he’d heard there was a “really great
puzzle last week” and he wanted a
copy for a long trip.
Bless everyone who bought
me drinks and chocolate raisins,
stroked my head or called me
pretty. Without redonculously great
support from Tessa, Fred, Cem and
Jess, I would not be the carefree
Desi girl you see before you. I am
really truly grateful to you guys. No,
you’re crying!
A shout out goes to all the brown
ladies who have given me life and
inspiration this year: the Indiras,
the Simrans, and Ayonijas of the
world, and plus my close personal
friends (in my head) Mindy Kaling
and Nadiya from Bake Off. Most
inspiration comes from the one
brown lady who did literally gave
me life: my grandma, who David
Cameron wants to deport but who,

in the 60s, followed home a woman

she didn’t know, purely because
she was wearing a sari too, and in
doing so made a lifelong friend.
Go through life with all the open-
heartedness that my grandmother
had for that sari-wearing stranger
on the bus, and the world will be
kind to you.
Now it’s time for me to pop off,
but this isn’t all about me, don’t
forget: drink some water, take your
meds and call your mum.
Fuckity bye!
