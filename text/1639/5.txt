Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community shouldn't have to be a big deal, but it is

I
am gay.
I’m sorry if this is a surprise.
I meant to tell you naturally,
over dinner maybe, or drinks.
It may have come up as you’d have
told me about your latest heartache
and I’d have told you of mine. You
may have been surprised, but you
wouldn’t have let it show. And just
like that, we would order another
drink and me being gay would have
been something normal. No big
deal.
So this shouldn’t be an article. It
shouldn’t be a big deal. I shouldn’t
have to publicly explore my
sexuality with thousands of people
watching. But it feels irresponsible
and immoral at this point not to.
Because a man killed 49 people on
Sunday in a gay club in Florida.
People he viewed as deviant,
undeserving of love, kindness, and
in the end, the right to life. People
like me. He didn’t know what their
favorite colour was. He didn’t know
if they liked dogs over cats.He didn’t
know if they donated to charity, if
they wanted children, if they were
dreamers, if they were good or bad
people. Would that have made a
difference?
I am a person, you know me, and I am gay
When I woke up on Sunday and
read the news, although I wasn’t
there, although I didn’t know the
victims, I felt crushed in a way I
never thought I’d feel. For the first
timeIfullyunderstoodhomophobia,
despite often having been a victim
of it in the past. Despite strangers
on the street calling me disgusting
for daring to hold the hand of the
man I loved in public.
It’s hard to explain what
homophobia feels like, especially
in the extreme form that it took on
Sunday. But imagine finding out
one day that someone hates you,
wants you dead for no reason other
than that you dare exist. And now
imagine this one person is actually
hundreds of people. Thousands.
Millions. From all over the world.
People you don’t know. People that
don’t even know you exist. Yet they
hate you.
Many of these people will never
even meet a queer person. Or so
they think, because so many gay
men and women live a lie,repressing
their true identity in fear of being
ostracised or worse.In some extreme
cases, repression can lead to denial,
delusion and self-rejection. So the
haters go on hating, unaware that
some of the people they love and
admire are gay; parents, siblings,
friends, idols.
I told my youngest brother that
I’m gay on Monday. He lives in
Greece so I couldn’t do it face to
face. My parents think he might
still be too young, but I was afraid
to wait any longer.Afraid that in the
absence of a visible gay person in his
life, blind hate might take root in
his heart.
Greece, despite its modern facade,
issteepedintradition.Unfortunately
this can often manifest as sexism
and homophobia. Although my
immediate family and friends
I shouldn't
have to
publicly
explore my
sexuality
know (and have been extremely
supportive), the rest of my family
back home is, I presume, blissfully
unaware of my actual sexual
preferences. Something unlikely to
have been helped by my own years
of repression and confusion.
If I’m honest, I’ve been reluctant
to come out to them. It’s been
easy. We live in different countries
and our reunions are few and far
between. I don’t want to have to do
this. I don’t want to be the source
of polarisation in my family (does
anyone?). I’m afraid some of them
might be deeply homophobic. But
maybe if they knew, they wouldn’t
be.
So today, even though I feel like
I’m still exploring love within myself
and with others, even though I hate
being pigeon-holed by a society that
sometimes reveals itself as deeply
intolerant, today I am a proud
gay man. And my favorite color is
turquoise.
I love the sea, the life it harbours,
the feelings it evokes. I need colour
in my life, when I wake up, when I
work, when I cook. My humor is at
best black and at worst lacking. My
style is questionable. I like crumpets
smothered in butter. I used to only
drink lager, but I’ve developed
a love for chocolate stouts. My
dad is Greek, my mum is Greek-
Australian. I like dogs, but only if
they’re big. Otherwise I prefer cats.
So starting today you know me as
a human first and as a member of
the LGBTQ+ community second.
And maybe next time someone
says fags are a plague you’ll think of
me and maybe you’ll say ‘No, that’s
just not right. This guy is wrong. I
should say something.’
And maybe you will say
something. And maybe one day we
won’t be hated.
In the
absence of
a visible gay
person in
his life, blind
hate might
take root
