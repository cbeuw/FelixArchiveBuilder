This week you're your mum.
She's waited for this moment
for 9 months. The moment
when you're home for more
than a week. Guaranteed
she'll be fed up of you within
the fortnight.

This week, you don’t
understand why there’s no
men’s scholarship for the
Imperial MBA, not realising
that merely having external
genitals is a scholarship to
the school of existence and
having a much fucking easier
life.
This week, you’ve
finally realised why you
weren’t invited to the
Women@Imperial event.You
don’t need an International
Women’s Day, because
you’re too busy living your
international women’s LIFE.
This week you're Kim Jong
Un and are caught smoking
during the middle of an anti-
smoking campaign in North
Korea. You decide you need
to quit once and for all and
so visit Imperial as they've
stopped selling cigarettes
but sadly you leave once you
find out just how strict their
censorship is.
This week you're a contestant
on "shit, it's the last week of
term and you still haven't
found a house". Let's have a
look and see what's behind
door number 2. It's £170 a
week, a shit hole and in Zone
5. Bargain.
This week you're in
Wetherspoons getting
hammered after your last
exam but you forget about
their anti-EU stance. 10
pints down you end up
drinking with their Brexit-
campaigning owner and
wake up on Queens Lawn
wearing only a Union Jack.
This week you celebrate the
Queen's 90th
birthday the
only way you know how,
plenty of alcohol in the Union
Bar. Queen Liz decides to
drop by and takes the yard of
ale record and knights Chris
Kaye for services to pizza
bases. He's almost reigned as
long as her too.
This week you're part of
the Battle of the Thames, in
which Nigel Farage captained
a fleet of anti-EU boats past
the Houses of Parliament
and clashed with a pro-EU
flotilla. Last time someone
that drunk tried to board a
boat, the medics rowers got
turned back from Dover.
This week, you’re desperate
for a third person to join
in your romantic rendez-
vous. You decide to invite
the editor of your student
newspaper, via the sex survey.
Despite the generous offer,
delivered to her in an cell in a
Excel file, she declines.
This week you're the sabbs.
Your year is finally grinding
to a halt, productivity stalls
and you accomplish next to
nothing. In fairness we could
print this every week.
This week you get given an
anti-EU condom by the Vote
Leave campaign. Ironically
you're safer in now.
This week, you’re vocal and
angry that there’s no men’s
scholarship for the Imperial
MBA. Rahhhh! Raaaaaah!
That the sound of your
future employer finding your
terrible opinions on Google
and not hiring you.
