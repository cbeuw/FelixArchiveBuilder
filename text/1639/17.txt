Eight Games Under
									 Eight Minutes
90 Second Portraits,
Tangram Games
Great art often results when artists
limit their tools and techniques
but few limit the amount of time
they have to produce their work.
In 90 Second Portraits you play
as a speed-painter, painting the
portraits of five customers – each
in a minute and a half. You’re
given two different paint brush
sizes and a bucket which can be
used, with varying force, to throw
paint onto the canvas. Together,
these constraints force you to be
creative. And your final work,
displayed after serving all your
customers, will look like the rushed
output of a toddler on Microsoft
Paint. In those 90 seconds, you
have little time to reflect and really
think about what you’re creating.
The result isn’t art, it’s a poorly
rushed product.
Cuckoo Curling,
Grenadine
Curling is a sport few millennials
will ever have dabbled in but
most will have played Connect
Four. Cuckoo Curling combines
these two games into a wacky
turn-based strategic sport. Players
take turns to slide their coloured
discs across the screen into a
grid, match four of your own
colour in a row or diagonally
and you win. However, unlike
Connect Four, the added element
of curling allows you to push your
opponent’s discs out of the play
area. Twisting the formula even
further are the two animals that
will snatch up your disc whenever
it falls outside the grid. This is all
rendered in stylised orange and
grey cel-shaded graphics. From
the charming animations to its
catchy music, Cuckoo Curling is
easily worthy of a few minutes of
your time.
Carrots and Cream,
Aergia
The faint crunching of food has
never been more terrifying.
Carrots and Cream simulates
gardening and food preparation,
and emulates horror movies all
in under five minutes. The screen
softly vibrates with a filter of
television static, as the player
ends the short lives of a number
of innocent carrots. After this
culinary massacre, the tables are
turned and as a worm you must
escape the deathly slice of a
garden shovel, only to be grated
to death. Truly horrific stuff.
Solitude,
Alexandre Ignatov
For many, our bedrooms are
places of isolation, separated
from the rest of the world.
Increasingly, it is a space we
never need to leave, with internet
services providing anything at any
time directly to our door. Solitude
takes place in a single room.
Notes, emails and a diary entry
give you a clue to the meaning of
this place and its importance. The
player, an unknown and faceless
character, has become a ‘hermit’.
By giving us only a single room
to explore, Igantov shows us how
this single space has come to
define a person. Try to leave and
only darkness greets you.
One Two Three Four
Giraffes Volleyball
Championship 2016,
Sandwich Puissant
It’s an idea so obvious (and
genius), I’m surprised it hasn’t
been done before. Giraffes with
their ridiculous necks and, in this
case, infinitely extendable legs
are a perfect match for everyone’s
favourite summer sport.
Awkwardly controlled arcade
games are the indie scene’s
bread and butter, and while
Giraffes Volleyball Championship
2016 isn’t quite QWOP, it’s still a
lot of fun. With extendable legs,
you have full movement in the 2D
plane which you’ll have to use to
beat the devastatingly difficult AI,
Amazing Giraffe. This is another
game best played with a friend.
Sagittarius,
George Prosser
For years, Team 17 have churned
out small variations on the Worms
formula, never straying far
from the iconic 2D deathmatch
gameplay that has made them
so successful. With Sagittarius,
Prosser has achieved more than
Team 17 have in over a dozen
sequels. Like Worms, Sagittarius
is turn-based with each player
equipped with a bow and arrow.
The similarities don’t end there:
gravity also plays a major role.
Planets with their own gravity
guide and ground the arrows
that kill opponents in one shot.
It’s hugely satisfying lining up the
perfect shot through the gravity
fields of numerous planets – a
feeling that is only matched by an
epic ricochet in PopCap’s Peggle.
Barb,
Kenney
The monochrome world inhabited
by Barbara guides players
through a morning routine. Bright
red household objects highlight
what the player must interact
with next. The ordinary rituals
of drinking coffee, showering,
getting dressed and checking
your phone are familiar to all.
They become second nature,
beyond our own control. They
come to define us in ways we are
not cognizant of. And only when
we stop and change routine do
we realise what we were doing.
Barb is the embodiment of this
idea. The twist that it ends on
might be shocking for some but
it shouldn’t be. For players that
don’t quite get what is going on
Kenny gives them a hint: “I didn’t
realise who I was until stopped
being who I wasn’t.”
Cooldog Teaches Typing,
Cooldog
Over the years we’ve seen a
surprising number of typing
games based on franchises as
wide ranging as Pokémon and
The House of the Dead, yet none
are as rad as Cooldog Teaches
Typing. From the yabbering of
cooldog to the warped voice of
your retro computer, the sound
is what makes Cooldog so
humorous. Each time you type
the wrong character on your
keyboard the computer erupts
with a loud squeak or boink.
Underneath the comical interface
and characterisation, Cooldog is
a reasonably competent typing
tutorial.
