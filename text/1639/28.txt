latest, Where to Invade Next?, a
light-hearted look at the benefits
of European-style socialism, which
Moore hopes to import as a solution
for the problems in his home
country.
In a modernised version of the
‘Grand Tour’, Moore zips through
Europe, looking at the particular
aspects each country excels in:
from France he takes the idea
of nutritious school meals; from
Iceland the emphasis on women
in roles of power; from Norway
the rehabilitation-focussed prison
system, and so on. Along the way
he briefly mentions the difficulties
facing America, with a montage of
footage that runs from the Korean
War, all the way up to Eric Garner’s
last moments.
He also gives statistics that – to
UK ears – sound horrific, such as
the fact that systematic electoral
manipulation means that in states
like Florida,up to one in three black
men cannot vote. Those watching
in Europe may feel smug, but they
cannot escape culpability: at one
point, Moore lists the companies
that use American prison workers–
in effect modern slave labour –
including Microsoft and Delta
Airlines.We are all Americans now;
none of us can take the moral high-
ground.
Moore concludes the film with
the bombastic claim that – surprise,
surprise – all these things are
actually American ideas. While the
truth of this statement is certainly
debatable (despite the fact that
women marched in support of the

have gifted us
with numerous
adaptations of
children’s tales, they have clearly
never come across The Boy Who
Cried Wolf. For the last few years,
every announcement of a new film
comes with a warning that this may
their last. While the creative heart
of the company, Hayao Miyazaki
announced his retirement in 2013,
he is still working to create short
films,and – after all – he said exactly
the same thing in 1997. And so the
news that their latest, When Marnie
Was There, is to be their last film for
the foreseeable future, does not fill
me with dread; or maybe it’s just
wishful thinking, optimistically
keeping the truth at bay, for – most
can agree – that Studio Ghibli have
made some of the most technically
impressive, emotionally complex
animated films of the last half-
century.
Based on the novel by Joan G.
Robinson, the film concerns Anna,
a young asthmatic girl who is sent
from Sapporo to the rural seaside
town of Kushiro for her health;
as well as her breathing, Anna
is suffering from some kind of
Equal Rights Amendment several
years before the election of Iceland’s
Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, I don’t think
America can lay claim to the totality
of the idea of women’s rights),
it serves to highlight Moore’s
willingness to clearly display his
ideological heart on his sleeve.
This is a feature of Moore that is
both frustrating and endearing –
particularly when you consider that
much of Moore’s work is borne
from deep-seated frustration at the
current American administration,
and a desire to better the lot
of society’s most marginalised
individuals.
Ending the film like this, however,
simply begs the question: just
where did America go wrong? And
unfortunately for Moore, this is a
much more interesting question
than the one he is asking. Moore
works much better when he looks
to his home turf, such as in his
exemplary Bowling for Columbine
and Fahrenheit 9/11. In some ways,
Where to Invade Next? resembles his
2007 film Sicko, which saw him look
at European models of socialised
healthcare: both films carry with
them a certain cherry-picking
sensibility, where Europe is made
out to be some kind of paradise.
Where to Invade Next? works best as
a breezy examination of European
sensibilities, but eschews any deeper
look at the problems of power
structures on both sides of the
Atlantic, and does not seem to add
anything new to the conversation.

psychological strain, linked to the
difficultrelationshipshehaswithher
well-meaning foster parents. With
a talent for drawing, Anna simply
wants to be left alone, eschewing
the company of local children in
order to sit for innumerable hours
looking across the salt marsh at the
abandoned mansion, overgrown
with gothic sentiment.
Rowing across to the mansion one
night at high tide,she meets Marnie,
a young girl of the old-time-
Europe variety (golden curls, bright
blue eyes, pretty ruffled dresses),
with whom she immediately
makes friends. What follows is an
exploration of the role of memories
and the imagination: is Marnie a
real person? Or just a figment of a
lonely child’s imagination? These
themes, along with the strong
indication that Anna has some
kind of anxiety/depressive disorder,
makes this heavy-hitting stuff – the
idea of exploring the mansion of
her imagination makes me think of
a child-friendly remake of Jacques
Rivette’s masterpiece, Celine and
Julie go Boating – but it is a pity
that director Hiromasa Yonebayashi
doesn’t follow up this initial promise.
Instead all the loose ends of When
Marnie Was There are tied up very
neatly, with a near-implausible
family revelation discovered at the
end of the film. While naturally
constrained by the source material’s
plot, it would have been fantastic if
they could have held onto the eerie,
unsettling atmosphere that made
the first half so captivating.

uch like the braying
politicians slugging
it out over the Brexit
debate currently
raging, many films currently being
released can be divided into two
distinct camps: there are those
that exploit the inherently visual
nature of cinema, to create works
that are visually astonishing, while
perhaps lacking in terms of plot
and pacing – call them ‘team look’.
And there are those that craft an
engaging narrative, chock full of
delicious, naturalistic dialogue (or
not. Looking at you, Sorkin!) and
a plot that grabs the viewer, but an
absence of aesthetic flourish – call
them ‘team plot’.But there are those
rare films that manage to combine
both worlds, resulting in a finished
product that speaks to the viewer
on a number of different levels:
visually, culturally, intellectually, and
personally. Embrace of the Serpent is
such a film.
Loosely based around the journals
of German ethnologist Theodor
Koch-Grünberg and American
ethnobotanist Richard Evans
Schultes, Embrace of the Serpent sees
the intertwining of two plotlines:
in 1909, Theo (Jan Bijvoet) is
terminally ill, and is combing the
Amazon rainforest to try and find
the yakruna, a sacred plant that will
cure him; in 1940, Evan (Brionne
Davis) is researching plants in the
same area, and also trying to find
the yakruna, which possesses both
hallucinogenic properties, and the
ability to increase the output of
rubber trees on which it is grown.
Their stories are connected by
Karamakate, a mystic shaman, and
the last of his tribe,who guides both
men through the forest. Just as the
Westerners are searching for their
plant, Karamakate is also searching
– initially for members of his tribe,
but later on for mere memories of
them. The themes of memory and
rebirth feature heavily in the film,
as the main principles cycle around
each other, tracing and retracing
familiar paths.
The fact that the actor playing the
older Karamakate, Antonio Bolívar
Salvador, is himself one of the last
of the Ocaina people only adds
emotional heft to what is already an
incredibly charged film. Embrace of
the Serpent looks at the devastation
Western colonialism can wrought
on an area:the repeated references to
the rubber farms, the slaves tortured
by plantation owners, the brutality
of the leaders of the Christian
missions, the hysteria induced by
mystic cults, which rushed in to fill
the gap left by the destruction of the
indigenous religious. It all speaks to
the vast, indelible legacy left behind
by colonialism, which Frantz Fanon
incisively referred to as ‘germs of
rot’, infecting both the minds of the
people and the very land itself.
The land, the particular nuances
and idiosyncrasies of the Amazon
basin, form another key player in
the film. Its title is taken from an
Amazonian myth, which states
that ancestral beings were brought
to Earth on a giant anaconda, and
went into the Amazon to teach
humans how to live in harmony
with nature; the body of the
anaconda became the Amazon
river, whose torturous paths cradle

Embrace of
the Serpent
raises
questions
about the
politics of
power
Embracing the depths of humanity
Embrace of the Serpent is a hallucinatory journey into the psyche of the Amazon
indigenous communities. The two
stories take place more than three
decades apart, but all that has really
changed is reflected in the jungle’s
human inhabitants; we can see
the passing of time in the lines on
Karamakate’s face, and the decay
wrought on the Christian mission’s
buildings, but the jungle remains
the same, unaffected by age, isolated
from regular temporal progression.
Embrace of the Serpent raises
questions, therefore, not only of
the politics of power, and Western
colonisation, but also metaphysical
ones on the nature of reality – the
heavy emphasis on the centrality of
hallucinogenic plants to indigenous
culture is a reflection of a different
train of philosophical thought, one
that embraces the phenomenologist
emphasis on consciousness and
appearance.
The film's director Ciro Guerra
(astonishingly, Embrace of the
Serpent is only his third full feature
film) handles such narrative
complexities with extreme grace,
and simultaneously manages to craft
one of the most visually astonishing
films in recent memory. Nearly the
entire film is shot in a brilliantly
crisp black and white, which reflects
the anthropological photographs
taken by explorers during the era,
several of which appear during the
film’s credits.
In many ways, the closest
comparison the film evokes for me
is the work of Sebastião Salgado,
the Brazilian photographer whose
work is a reflection on the epic and
the sublime power both of nature
and of humanity. Cinematography
David Gallego, who like Guerra,
only has a handful of credits to his
name, has rendered the Amazon
in exacting style, and the result is a
masterwork of visual force.
Embrace of the Serpent is that rare
beast: a film that manages to exploit
the formidable ability the camera
has to tell a story and raise questions,
while still managing to be a wholly
beautiful work. Guerra takes us on
a hallucinatory journey into the
deepest part of the jungle, forcing
us to confront the very nature of
power and humanity. Embrace of
the Serpent is a film that leaves us
humbled, nourished, and sublimely,
wonderfully, wholly enriched.
