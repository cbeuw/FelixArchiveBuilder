his is the frustrating,
and tragic tale of a
woman called Hester
Collyer. She is, as the
title of the play suggests, stuck
between a newfound lover and her
husband. The play is a strange but
intriguing one which explores the
difficult relationship the trio shares,
centred of course around Hester.
The husband, a high-ranking judge,
makes matters more complicated
because of the stigma attached to
divorce. This beautiful play was
written by the renowned playwright
Terence Rattigan, and has its
roots in his own difficult personal
experiences. Carrie Cracknell’s
direction is brilliant and reveals the
complex emotions of Hester and
those close to her, the performance
is multidimensional, both in its
characters, and even in its scenery.
The play is intricately subtle with
cast and direction doing it the justice
it deserves.Hester is played by Helen
McCrory, and her performance is,
in a word, astounding. She conveys
with the utmost authenticity the
turbulent emotions of a troubled
through. Her interaction with the
other characters, especially the two
men in her life, are realistic and,
more importantly, revealing.
Sir William Collyer, Hester’s
husband, is portrayed by Peter
Sullivan as a stalwart man who
holds his standing in society in the
utmost regard,he seems formal with
Hester, and oddly seems to regard
her relationship with her lover,
Freddie Page, very much as a matter
of fact rather than something to be
resented. However, there are times
when deeper feelings do manage
to penetrate his upright exterior.
In sharp contrast Mr Page, played
by Tom Burke, comes across as
erratic , possibly due to his personal
troubles working as an RAF test
pilot. Collyer’s relationship with
her lover is passionate at times, and
there are sporadic bouts of longing,
lusty desire. However, these are
often restrained by the shackles of
the past, and of the sticky situation
that incarcerates them.
Another interesting character is
Mr Miller, a doctor struck-off for
mysterious reasons, who seems to
share a lot more in common with
Hester than might first appear.
Nick Fletcher manages to play the
talkative landlady are almost
inappropriately funny at times.
Even the more restrained characters
such as Mr Miller had the audience
laughing out loud when, in response
to being asked why Hester might
have tried to commit suicide, he
states sarcastically that “she wanted
to die, I suppose”. These clever
splashes of black humour make the
show a delight to watch.
It is also not only the characters
who are multidimensional. The
scenery is creatively constructed
consisting of multiple different
rooms, where simultaneous events
take place through smoky blue
screens, giving a sense of multiple
goings-on without ever being
distracting.I thought this was a great
addition to the play helping to add
realism and possibly representing a
physical manifestation of Hester’s
own isolation, as indistinct shadows
moved about outside of her lonely
abode.

and elation
mind, a cacophony of self-hatred,
depression and elation, all fuelled
by the hot rage of a full on mental
war between logic and love. Hester
Collyer comes across as a strong
woman, but within lies a weak
helplessness in the face of this
choice. Helen McCrory’s portrayal
is exquisitely transparent; the
audience knows and empathises
with exactly what Hester is going
Clever
splashes of
black humour
make the
show a delight
part perfectly; soberly at times,
and yet exposes Mr Miller’s more
sophisticated make-up in a heated
one-on-one confrontation with
Hester later on.
The show contains dark themes
throughout. Despite this, characters
such as Mr Welch (Hubert Burton),
a middle-class husband, and Mrs
Elton (Marion Bailey), an overly-
