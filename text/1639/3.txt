Top investor buys shares in Imperial Innovations
Neil Woodford now owns 20% of our research and development arm
O
ne of the UK’s
top investors, Neil
Woodford has invested
a further £11.6 million
into Imperial Innovations, the
intermediary between Imperial
research and the wider world,taking
his stake over 20%.
Imperial Innovations had posted a
pre tax loss of £5.9 million in the six
months before the end of January,
but its share prices have bounced
back to £3.45 a share, largely in
part to the purchase by Woodford,
whose fund now owns 21% of the
company, up from 19.9%.
Woodford is also the manager of
Capita Financial Woodford Equity
a fund which has a huge chunk of
its portfolio in the tobacco industry.
Eagle-eyed readers of FELIX will
notice that this is the fund where
Imperial College have themselves

been investing £5.8 million of their
endowment fund, of which almost
£1 million goes directly into tobacco
companies. All in all Woodford
and Imperial (in one form or
another) are linked, a link that ties a
university which focuses on research
into cancer, directly to the tobacco
industry.
Imperial Innovations has a sole
commercialisation rights deal on
technology coming out of Imperial
College research until 2020 and
have recently been in the news
after selling its remaining shares
in Alkion Biopharm, an Imperial
College spinoff company, to
chemical giant Evonik Industries.
Imperial Innovations also oversee
Yoyo Wallet, the app which means
you can still by drinks even if you
drunkenly lose your debit card at
ACC.
Woodford has also waded into the
EU referendum debate this week,
saying that Brexit or a Bremain was
not really the most important issue
affecting the global economy in the
long term, and that the things that
he believes are likely to cause the
chaos (growing wealth inequality,
the Chinese credit bubble and the
aging population to name a few)
will not go away in either scenario.
So in essence whichever way you
vote on June 23rd
, we might all be
fucked regardless.

UCL in financial hot water
And it's not because of that rent strike
U
CL expansions are
putting a strain on their
finances and are in the
process of taking out the
largest loan ever by a UK institution
from the European Investment
Bank. The £280 million is in order
to help fund the £1.25 billion
expansion plan aimed at expanding
both the student body and the
research capacity of the university.
During the last decade UCL has
expanded its student body to 35,000,
an almost 50% rise, and doubled its
research capacity.A merger between
UCL and Imperial was also touted
in 2002 in order to create an
Oxbridge beating supercollege
by the then rector, Richard Sykes
(the one who tried to ban the hijab
and hoodies and up tuition fees to
£10,500).
Addressing the academic
board, Michael Arthur (the man They do have a nicer campus than us, though. Photo Credit: Wikipedia
responsible for setting the academic
budget) emphasised that UCL
only had 42 days of cash in hand as
opposed to the average 90+ days that
other universities have. Essentially
if all cash coming in stops, they can
only pay staff for 42 days which isn’t
ideal.
Cash has also partially dried up
from the rent strikes that UCL
has held this year, with the missing
payments totalling over £1 million,
small but not insignificant. The
attempts by UCL to reclaim any of
this money have been minimal with
the university demanding just a
£25 fine from each of the thousand
strikers, a gesture that is a drop in
the ocean.
This may however be a sign of
things to come with UCL students
planning to issue an ultimatum
while disrupting UCL’s open day
this month. The Cut The Rent
campaigners are threatening that if
the college didn’t cut rents by their
demanded 40% then they would
take matters into their own hands
and only pay 60% of accommodation
fees. UCL themselves have said
that this would be a “huge loss”
financially and that they could “no
longer provide it [accommodation]”
if they were not able to break even.
