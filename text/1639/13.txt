Back in 2008, Tom Roberts, Azfarul
Islam and Michael Cook launched
Another Castle, a multi-format
gaming magazine. In their first issue,
they secured an interview with Peter
Molyneux, an industry behemoth
at the time. Gaming has changed a lot since then
(Peter Molyneux all but disappeared into the ether)
and the way we write about games has changed
too. Kieron Gillen (comic book writer and former
music and games journalist) published the manifesto
for New Games Journalism in 2004, which set out
a new way of thinking and discussing games, where
a reviewer’s personal experience was core to their
analysis and reflection. In the past half-decade
numerous publications (from Kill Screen to Feminist
Frequency) and existing publications have adopted
these ideas. Now it’s the turn of Imperial students
to continue this great exploration of gaming culture.
This issue is my attempt to resurrect interest in games
journalism at Imperial and it’s a project that is far
from finished (hence issue zero). It begins with an
interviewwithMarkMorris,anImperialgraduatewho
helped found Introversion Software, telling the story
of a games company that has seen unprecedented
success despite almost going bankrupt after the
release of one of their games. Harry Mitchell writes
fondly about Half-Life 2 more than twelve years
after its release, while Dani Hernandez Perez gives
us a brief history of storytelling in videogames. Film
editor, Tilda Swinton fanatic, and Guardian Student
Media Awards nominee, Fred Fyles, interprets The
Sims in an essay that goes beyond what even Kieron
Gillen envisaged for games journalism.
Over the last year I’ve almost singlehandedly kept
the games section of FELIX alive but I need your
support if I am to continue. If you’re interested in
helping to shape the future of Another Castle please
get in touch.
