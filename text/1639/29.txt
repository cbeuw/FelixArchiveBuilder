Your summer of binge watching
Eight shows to help you burn through time rather than yourself
S
ummer’s here, which means
actual free time again
without the constant spectre
of revision hanging over
your head. You might be wondering
just what to do with it all. Well,
there’s always the classic fall-back;
say ‘screw it’ and watch some TV.
Here’s a list of eight great shows to
help you do just that.
Happyish is a show to check out
if you’re a fan of existential satire
and/or Steve Coogan. In it, Coogan
stars as middle-aged man working
at an advertising agency as he
trudges through his mid-life crisis
and deals with the ennui of modern
life. Featuring frequent jaunts into
the surreal and wonderfully dark
comedy; this short but consistently
funny show definitely bears a watch.
Downton Abbey was once
described to me as ‘EastEnders
for the petty bourgeois’. Looking
past the generous serving of
douchebaggery in that sentence,
it’s not an inaccurate assessment.
We follow the lives of the Earl of
Grantham’s family and servants on
thecuspofthe20th
century;exploring
the effect that rapid societal change
has on their lives. Always expertly
acted, and consistently engaging;
the series is a must watch for anyone
who enjoys dramas or historical
pieces.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
springs forth from the mind of Tina
Fey and 30 Rock producer Robert
Carlock, Unbreakable maintains its
predecessor’s offbeat and unique
flavour of humour. The show
tracks the journey and struggle of
Kimmy Schmidt to fit into modern
day New York, after having been
kidnapped and locked in a bunker
for 15 years. This seemingly heavy
set-up is handled deftly, and much
of the comedy stems from Kimmy’s
interactions with a colourful, yet
still believable, supporting cast. If
you liked 30 Rock, or are a fan of
Wes Anderson films, you’ll like this.
11.22.63 has a pedigree that is
immediately evident in the names
attached to it; the series is based
on a Stephen King novel and stars
James Franco in the leading role. It
centres on a disenfranchised school
teacher, who discovers a time-portal
to 1960 in the back of a diner, and
is persuaded to try and stop the
Kennedy assassination. He quickly
discovers, however, that the web of
conspiracy is more intricate than he
is prepared for. And then there’s the
small matter that time itself does
not want to be changed.
Archer can just about be summed
up with the phrase ‘James Bond as
an ultra-alcoholic lovable asshole’.

This week on Game of Thrones
It’s season six, episode eight!
W
e’re coming up to
the final episodes
of the second to
last season of this
show and they apparently still have
the time to meander around for an
episode with nothing particularly
interesting happening. Ah well,
here’s a recap anyway.
We open with Lady Crane giving
her monologue as Cersei at Joff’s
death again, but we can see that
she took Arya’s advice to bring
anger to the scene. As she leaves the
stage she finds Arya, stabbed and
bleeding, in her bed asking for help.
Bit of a turnaround there. Two days
ago Arya decided to not murder her
at the last minute then now she’s
begging for medical help? Arya
has a quick chat about her career
aspirations before getting drugged
up.
Next up, we have a few guys
sitting around in a forest, fingering
each other. I love a bit of bromance.
The Hound marches in and puts a
stop to that with some axework and
commits the definition of adding
insult to injury “You’re shit at dying,
you know that?”. Later he runs
into the guys that actually killed
his mates about to be executed
by the Brotherhood without
Banners (They are really liking the
throwbacks this season aren’t they?)
and Beric and Thoros allow him to
kick them off their hanging blocks.
Generous blokes they are. I’m
interested to see how this is going
to join up into the bigger story.
We then have yet another scene of
Tyrion and Varys strolling through
Meereen intellectually sparring
before Tyrion says goodbye to Varys
who’s going on some secret mission
back to Westeros, apparently to get
some ships for Dany. Seems to me
he’d be put to better use trying to
actually find their Queen but hey,
I’m not the Master of Whispers.
Cersei’s just having a nice sit down
in the Red Keep with her massive
zombie bodyguard when her cousin
Lancel shows up and lets her know
that Il Papa wants to see her in the
Sept. She disagrees. There’s a short
zombie fight scene before the monks
all run away scared. She eventually
shows up to the throne room and
Kevan tells her to fuck off up to
the balcony and all the other girls
keep their distance from her. She’s
like the Regina George of King’s
Landing. Tommen announces that
Cersei and Loras are to have their
trials soon and that trial by combat
isn’t happening. She shits herself
slightly at this announcement
(as does anyone in favour of
Cleganebowl) then has an odd,
cryptic conversation with her evil
scientist friend. Continuing on the
bromantic theme from earlier, we
get a nice reunion of Bronn and Pod
when Brienne turns up at Riverrun;
Bronn is totally sure they’re fucking.
I almost forgot about Podrick’s
magic cock. Brienne enters Jaime’s
tent to have a quick catch up and
she tries to return Jaime’s sword to
him but he declines. When they
get down to business (not like that)
she reveals her plan to get Blackfish
and the Tully army back up North,
Jaime’s just like ‘Look you can try
if you like but that plan is awful’.
I’m inclined to agree with that one.
Just a little bit more sexual tension
between the two before she heads
into the castle to talk to Blackfish.
He explains to her that he’s not
going to abandon his ancestral
home to travel all the way North to
die for his great-niece that he barely
knows. Honestly, you could’ve
predicted that response Brienne.
Back in Meereen Tyrion’s using
peer pressure to get his friends to
drink. Initially they refuse but he
tells enough bad jokes that they
decide that they definitely are going
to need to get drunk for this. Grey
Worm goes for a bit of banter too
but his is so bad that the Wise
Master’s begin bombarding the
whole city (ShitLAD). He freaks
out at Tyrion’s poor negotiating
skills then Dany storms into the
palace like a BAMF.
Back to Riverrun and Jaime’s
chatting with Edmure Tully, first
offering him a nice life in a castle
before dropping the ‘I will murder
your baby because I want to fuck my
sister’ bombshell. Edmure complies.
As soon as he lets himself back into
his castle he tells them all to bitch
out of the fight so he can see his fit
wife. Brienne escapes in a boat but
the Blackfish decides that he might
as well die now in a blaze of glory.
Sadly, the show didn’t have the
budget for that swordfight so we
get the news when some random
soldier tells Jaime he died. We then
get more sexual tension in the form
of an awkward boat wave.
We finish up the episode with
Arya’s surrogate mother being
murdered followed by the Waif
chasing down Arya like the bloody
Terminator, this ends poorly for the
Waif. Arya then displays her face
as a trophy for Jaqen, like when a
cat kills a bird then drags its corpse
into your house. Honestly, this is
probably the weakest episode of the
season. There was a lot of wasted
time which you wouldn’t expect
so close to the end of the season,
particularly the Tyrion scenes could
have had much more purpose to
them. Oh well, next week we have
The Battle of the Bastards, that
much be where the swordfighting
budget from this episode went.

Probably
the weakest
episode of
the season
A superbly animated parody of
the spy genre; the series chronicles
the misadventures of ‘the world’s
most dangerous spy’, the titular
Sterling Archer. Featuring a stellar
supporting cast in the form of his
co-workers at spy agency ISIS (2009
was a more innocent time); the show
could also easily be described as an
office-comedy a la, well, The Office.
There are excellent action sequences
and consistently funny comedy that
has reached meme levels. Starring
the inimitable H. Jon Benjamin,
this seven season behemoth cannot
be recommended enough.
Batman: The Animated Series, is
perhaps the perfect distillation of
the Dark Knight in any medium.
This show is recommended for fans
and newcomers alike. It manages
to be dark, poetic, heartfelt, and
hopeful all at once; capturing all
the angles of The Batman, and
showing just why it is he endures in
the public imagination. The series
also contains character defining
portrayals of Batman and the Joker,
from Kevin Conroy and Mark
Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker). If
Batman v. Superman left a bad taste
in your mouth that you’d like to
wash out, or if you’re just wondering
what the big deal is with this Bat-
guy, this is the one to watch.
Psych is one of those ‘special
detective’ shows, where the lead
character is able to solve any crime
by the power of being amazing.
Thankfully,it doesn’t take its premise
seriously and has lots of fun with it.
Shawn Spencer is the son of a police
officer,and a brilliant detective in his
own right,who doesn’t much care for
the commitment or discipline of the
force. So he pretends to be a psychic
detective who subcontracts on
cases. Much of the humour comes
from the excellent banter between
characters, and the show features
one of the greatest bromances in
TV history.
TrueDetective,asitsnameimplies,
is an anthology show, with each
series chronicling a different group
of individuals dealing with crime.
Hauntingly atmospheric, frequently
poetic, and always enthralling; the
show is a must watch for mystery
buffs. The first season is sublime,
with powerhouse performances
from Mathew McCaughey and
Woody Harrelson. But be careful;
just do yourself a favour and avoid
the second season.
