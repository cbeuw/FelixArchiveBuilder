those surveyed identified
as “straight”. The decrease
in this Imperial figure over
five years is reflected in
other studies in recent
years, which have shown
that young people’s
attitude to rigid
boundaries on
sexuality have
changed to
become more
fluid.
40% of
those who
identified as
heterosexual
said they’d
had some
kind of sexual
e x p e r i e n c e
with a member
of the same sex.
Overall, women
were more likely to
have done so (60%) than
men (43%).

T
here are a lot of assumptions we make with the sex survey. Yes, our
600 respondents are likely to be a little more swayed
towards the sexually active, because let’s
face it, it’s more fun to talk about
sex if you’re having it. We
had fewer responders from the
Business School, and have
perhaps underrepresented
some of the engineering
departments. Home
students far outnumber
EU and international
responders, but we
do have a good
spread across
the year
g r o u p s ,
and a
d e c e n t
gender
ratio.
I
nterestingly,justoverhalf
of respondents reported
having had some sexual
contact (anything from
kissing to full on sexy
times) with someone of
the same sex. 75%
of respondents
identified as
h e t e r o s e x u a l ,
with 7% saying
they were gay
and 12% were
bisexual. Gay
men vastly
o u t n u m b e r
the number
of gay women
who took
the survey,
whereas there
were more
bisexual women
than men. 3% of
you rejected our rigid
sexuality labels, with
the most common unlisted
sexual orientation being
pansexual.
Our sex survey results in
2011 reported that 83% of
Self Love
10%ofyousaidyoudidn’tmasturbate.
66% of you watch porn, with those
seeing multiple people being the
most prevalent watchers, of
whom 75% are regularly tuning
in. A whopping 22% of you
have masturbated on campus,
not including in halls. In terms
of regularity, just over half of
you are putting aside time
to self-love once a week, but
30% of you had masturbated
on the day you took the survey.
Singletons and those seeing
one person non-exclusively were
masturbating the most often.
Love n stuff
W
oah! 19% of
you said you’d
cheated on a
partner. But
you’re a damaged
lot, because 19% also suspected
they’d been cheated on.
When we asked you if you were in love, a surprisingly
high number of you were. 77% of those in exclusive
relationships said they were, with 46% of those asked
overall admitting to being in love. On the other hand,
15% of you chose the response ‘what is love’? Fair.
“Please add a diagram of
where the cliterous [sic] is.
Please FELIX, please.”
“Sex is
healthy, do it
nerds.”
“Where
are these
tunnels I hear
about?”
“Shout out to
anyone who bones
in Bone, gives a
rogering in Roderick
Hill or gets down
to business in the
Business School.”
“After having sex in the
Great Hall, we stood naked
on stage and took a bow.”
H
ere it is, for the sixth year running, the infamous FELIX
Sex Survey results. Thank you so much to everyone who
trusted us with your deepest, darkest, and occasionally
unrealistic and obviously made-up secrets (we deleted
those responses from our data). Six hundred or so of
you took the time to fill it out though, and we are very grateful. Your
data was always anonymous, and now it will be deleted forever, but
remains immortalised below in emoji-enhanced infographic form, for
generations to come to enjoy. We’ve looked at how student sexuality
has changed over the years, whether or not it really is harder to find
a girl if you’re a guy at Imperial, and which departments are most into
butt stuff – looking at you, mech eng. Enjoy!
