Public healthcare cuts cause
otherwise preventable deaths
Science
& the City
T
he year has come to an
end. We’ve jammed and
transformed our brains,
learning some things
better than others. We’ve prepared
ourselves with the tools we need for
the next chapter in our lives. As we
all go our own ways this summer
(unless you’re stuck here on campus
toiling away while everyone jovially
twirls outside in their freedom, like
me) what are the really important
things to remember from all we’ve
experienced this year?
Hopefully we’ve learned that the
individual components of science
can be fallible, and so they should
be. Something that cannot be tested
or tried with the likelihood of failure
is something that cannot improve,
learn,and reach the next rung on the
ladder of progress. As practitioners
of science, we constantly revise old
methods, ideas, and materials, while
creating and uncovering new ones.
Science accepts that old ways of
thinking must change in the light of
new knowledge
And this fallibility and willingness
to change and grow, is perhaps one
of the most subtle yet powerful
lessons science has for us as human
beings. We constantly face a world
that tests the mettle of our character
and makes us question our old ways
of thinking and being, in the ways
we treat the world and each other.
At the risk of sounding like I’m
proselytizing, I propose we should
use this scientific technique of self-
correction to improve ourselves; to
become kinder and better people.
In the light of the types of events
that have shaken the consciousness
of the Western world recently
(and one can barely imagine the
events the rest of the world endures
without the light of our media
lens) which threaten to destabilise
an understanding of the collective
unity of humanity, science can help
guide the way. Self-correcting our
prejudice, hatred, and selfishness
by reviewing the ‘literature’ and
seeing that it never, ever does the
world good. Changing our practices
to those loving, accepting actions
that have proved to increase our
individual and collective happiness
time and time again. Call it
humanity or call it science – there’s
no better choice for us but to grow
and learn from our mistakes.

Science, what’s good?
The drug ixekizumab has been
shown to clear 80% of psoriasis
suffering patients. Dr. Kenneth
Gordon, dermatology professor at
Northwestern University Feinberg
School of Medicine, first author
of the paper publishing the results
of the phase three trials, explained
that these positive responses
persisted for at least 60 weeks.
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated
inflammatory response which is
also associated with increased risk
of depression, heart disease and
diabetes. The drug functions by
neutralising the immune system
pathway which is known for
promoting psoriasis. Participants
of the trials suffered from psoriasis
ranging from moderate to severe.
Drug effectiveness was measured
via comparisons with a placebo.
Clearing the symptoms is finally
a reality. The drug has been
approved by the Food and Drug
Administrations, however the safety
of the drug for longer than 60 weeks
still needs to be studied.

Emo or ecstatic? How do you
feel when sad music loops on your
Spotify playlist? Researchers at
Durham University have found
that sad music affects different
people in different ways. 2436
individuals from the UK and
Finland participated in the survey
that investigated the impact of
music for mood control. While
some people felt an essence of joy
when sad music was played, others
found music physically straining
and deflating as it spurred the
dreaded remembrance of loved ones
and other painful experiences. The
disparity in reactions is thought to
mainly be due to music associations
with certain environmental
experiences, thus the research has
implications for music therapist
to carefully consider the music
representations for their choice
of music. So if next time you play
‘Barbie Girl’ your flatmate starts to
ugly cry as he’s singing along to the
chorus, don’t be too surprised.

Is this song sad
or is it happy?
Despite the hundreds of cat
fail videos on the interwebs
suggesting otherwise, new research
from Kyoto University in Japan
confirms that cats indeed possess
an understanding of physics. The
research suggests that cats can not
only understand the principle of
cause and effect, but also some
elements of physics. The science is
not exactly groundbreaking though.
Experiments consisted of putting
objects in containers and testing
whether cats could predict whether
the containers were empty or not
based on the sounds they made.
The researchers also noted that cats
seemed to stare longer at containers
that sounded empty but ended up
hiding an object inside and the other
way round. Prolonged staring is the
cat equivalent of bewilderment FYI.
So if you’ve watched those videos
of cats playing Cups and Balls and
wondered how the cats seemed to
get it right every time, the answer
is physics. Oh, and a good sense of
hearing.

Scientists at the Science
Foundation’s Green Bank Telescope
ogled through their highly sensitive
radio telescope to observe the
first complex chiral molecule. The
molecule, hiding under the thick
cover of a cloud of stardust is named
Propylene Oxide (CH3
CHOCH2
).
If you are not familiar with the
popular chemistry term ‘chiral
molecule’, it refers to molecules
which have left­
h-anded and right­
handed conformations while being
identical in every other respect. Just
like our hands, a mirror image of
each other. Why is this discovery
so...handy? Chiral molecules are
essential to life on earth. Thus, their
discovery is a pioneering leap for
understanding the origin of life and
how our prebiotic molecules are
built in the universe. The next stage
is to observe which handedness is of
excess; stay tuned as more exciting
discoveries are sure to follow.

N
ew research from the
University of Montana
suggests that when it
comes to earthquakes,
things are even more complicated
than we originally thought.The team
of scientists looked at GPS records
of surface motion during the 2015
Gorkha earthquake, that ravaged
Nepal, killing over 8000 people.
They found that the earthquake
failed to rupture the Himalayan
faults (planar fractures) and
resulted in afterslip which released
aseismic-movement equivalent to
a magnitude 7.1 earthquake. Such
‘incomplete’ earthquakes seem to
happen quite frequently and are
the main reason behind geological
shifts. The research, albeit shedding
light on the inner workings of
earthquakes, also highlights the fact
that we are even worse at predicting
earthquakes than we thought.

f you haven’t already, I implore
you all to read The Diet
Myth by Tim Spector, the
acclaimed work by professor
of genetic epidemiology and
consultant physician (sadly at a
rival university here in London).
It finely elucidates all the factors
which play gargantuan roles in the
way we react to and absorb all the
nutrients in the food we eat. One
chapter on the nutritional benefits
of mushrooms particularly intrigued
me, for reasons more than merely
spore-related. Namely, the way we
can develop yoghurt specific to our
vaginal microbial population, to
ward off fungal infection. Yum.
Let’s start at the beginning. Fungi
such as mushrooms are basically
large collections of microbes that
feed off dead or decaying matter
in the soil, in order to grow and
reproduce. They also happen to
adore living off humans as well.
No use fretting over mushrooms
sprouting all over you, though
something of the sort can happen
on a minor scale if you don’t, say,
dry your feet and in between your
toes properly, since these critters
thrive on moisture and humidity.
All that aside, fungi also live in
our gut as yeasts. Nothing to worry
about here either, since they live
happily in a symbiotic relationship
with the microbes that reside there.
However, with improper antibiotic
treatment usually administered
in an effort to correct the yeast
population (very typical in Chinese
medicine), it’s easy to throw off
the delicate balance of our natural
microbe flora. These microbes help
defend against fungal infection,
and minute populations of yeast are
invaluable to our body’s immune
system. This leads to dangerous
and severe fungal infections such as
candida, usually seen on the mouth
and tongue. Candida of the vagina
(also known as thrush) is actually
quite a normal part of being female,
for it develops at some point in
a female’s life, though it’s nicely
warded off by our friendly gut
inhabitants lactobacillus bacteria.
Could you perhaps recall the food
type teeming with lactobacillus?
Yoghurt is probably the first thing
that comes to mind. The popular
probiotic was tested as a treatment
for candida in randomized trials,
however, most cases have not been
particularly successful, purely
because each individual’s microbe
population is incredibly diverse
and differs between individuals.
Thus, immunologists have started
developing vaginal yoghurt
– yoghurt containing specific
lactobacillus strains resembling the
rather specialised vaginal microbe.
We can ingest this tangy concoction
to ward off candida infections, and
this could also potentially help fight
infections like HIV and AIDS.
Dessert, anyone?

W
e all witnessed
the devastating
effects of the
2008 economic
crisis, as ordinary people lost their
jobs and homes, and saw their
hard-earned savings and financial
security evaporate. Now a team of
researchers are warning that the
financial collapse may have also
led to the preventable deaths of
hundreds of thousands of people.
With the NHS already facing
enormous pressure and under
threat from cuts from disingenuous
politicking, this discovery doesn’t
bode well for the UK. In a study
published recently in The Lancet,
researchers uncovered damning
links between slashed public health
spending, unemployment, and
160,000 cancer-related deaths in
the EU alone in the fallout of the
recession.
The team analysed data from the
World Bank and World Health
Organisation from 1990-2010
for almost 80 countries with
different incomes and healthcare
systems, accounting for over two
billion people. They compared
healthcare spending leading up to
and following the recession with
deaths from different types of
‘treatable’ and ‘untreatable’ cancers.
Unemployment and funding cuts
were markedly tied to increased
cancer mortality, and countries
without universal healthcare, like
the United States, fared much
worse.
“The US actually spends three
times as much per person on
healthcare than the UK,but the issue
is that it doesn’t provide universal
healthcare coverage…we found
that between 2008 and 2010, the
UK didn’t experience any additional
deaths, whereas the US experienced
around 18,000 additional cancer
deaths – we believe – because of
the economic crisis,” explained lead
author Dr.Mahiben Maruthappu of
Imperial College, Senior Fellow to
the CEO of NHS and a practicing
doctor.
Connections between healthcare
availability and mortality might
seem obvious to those of us who
have experienced difficulties
accessing adequate care or
macroeconomic studies are not
showing direct cause and effect.
Rather, they hint at indirect but
potentially lethal ripples in the wake
of economic collapses.
As a result, scientists are keen to
do more research about what has
happened since 2010, considering
the “effects of the economic crisis
have been quite long-lasting and
global unemployment remains
significantly higher than before”,
according to Maruthappu.
Still, it’s a compelling argument
that universal healthcare actually
protects human lives during tougher
economic times, “because when
you factor it in, the link between
unemployment and cancer mortality
disappears,” said Maruthappu.
If this study holds true, and future
data shows that a lack of universal
health care coverage does lead
to cancer-related deaths that are
otherwise preventable, government
attempts to reduce NHS services
and access is something British
citizens will want to be wary of.The
NHS may not be a perfect system,
but in the face of pending economic
uncertainty like that of Brexit, it
may literally save our lives.
treatment. But previous studies in
global ‘healthconomics’ have only
looked at deaths related to higher
levels of stress,like suicide and heart
disease.This study is first of its kind
to isolate cancer in this light.
Other researchers have been
cynical of the study, and cautioned
against over-generalisations. Dr.
Eliana Barrenho,a health economist
at Imperial College London, said
using cancer rates as a health
measure can produce distorted
results because “the distribution of
prevalence and mortality of these
are not homogeneous across the
globe… [and] richer countries with
more access to health care have
showed higher levels and degrees
of cancer screening which, per se,
might increase incidence”.
These concerns were echoed by
Dr. Laurence Roope, a development
economist at the University of
Oxford. However, he did also say
that the findings were still very
plausible and “it’s obvious that
access to good quality healthcare
is what matters to whether or not
people survive”.
Study authors acknowledged
these limitations, arguing that these
