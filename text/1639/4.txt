Imperial is one of Europe’s
most innovative universities
We've come second in the Thomson Reuters
innovation list
T
homson Reuters
this week released a
report listing the most
innovative universities in
Europe,with Imperial coming in 2nd
on the list just behind KU Leuven
in Belgium.
Innovation was defined by using
ten different parameters, notably
the volume of academic papers
it published (indicating the basic
research) as well as the number
of patents filed by an institute
(showing how well it furthers this
research). A key factor in this may
be the partnership the college has
with Imperial Innovations (see the Dat innovation tho. Photo Credit: Imperial College London
article on the previous page) which
has helped to foster development of
ideas coming out of Imperial.
Lagging behind Imperial were
University of Cambridge in 3rd
and University Oxford in 8th
, with
Manchester and Dundee coming
inside the top twenty.The University
of London, the parent that Imperial
left the nest from in 2007 came in
30th
,with 17 UK universities making
the top 100. This is in comparison
to 24 German universities, the most
of any European country, showing
how on the innovation forefront,the
UK is a major player, but not quite
the best.
It should be known that this
takes the innovation of a university
as a whole and so individual
departments may be better from
one university or another but overall
Imperial stands tall.

...and quintile five, the least
disadvantaged.
Things like references, work
experience and quality of personal
statements are not taken into
account in this data. However,
grades and courses are arguably
the most reliable when predicting
whether a student will get an offer.
Only data concerning 18-year-old
home applicants was collected and
it was released as part of an effort by
UCAS to me more transparent, and
to help universities look out who
they’re letting in and to improve
their practises.
A spokesperson from Imperial told
us: “Imperial is proud of its highly
diverse community and strives to
ensure that its doors are open to
the best and brightest students,
whatever their background.”
“We have a broad portfolio of
activities targeted at academically
talented pupils. This includes
working with schools, colleges and
Imperial application bias revealed in UCAS stats
community organisations to raise
aspirations, change perceptions,
support teaching staff and stimulate
interest in STEM subjects
from primary school through to
A-Levels.”
“Imperial welcomes the
publication of this data. We are
working to further understand
what factors are at play, and how we
can act to improve our admissions
process.”
As far as outreach, Imperial has a
dedicated department for reaching
disadvantaged students, running
summer schools, lectures and taster
days for school children.
Jennie Watson, the union's DPW
told FELIX: "It is inexcusable that
fewer black applicants are receiving
offers, however this is nothing new
and not unique to Imperial.It’s been
known for a long time that there are
unconscious biases in the Higher
Education recruitment process.This
data represents a wider societal issue
though, insofar as the educational
trajectory of an individual is set
long before they apply to university,
therefore this problem cannot be
solved only by universities’initiatives
to widen access to education."
If it’s the parts of their applications
that aren’t from predicted grades that
are letting disadvantaged students
down, college may need to change
its enrolment process to account for
schools not giving their students
the best advice on applying, in order
to really level the playing field.
Otherwise, college will continue
to inadvertently not offer places to
the best students, discounting the
benefits of their background.
Last year, David Cameron
announced that UCAS applications
were going name-blind from 2017
in an attempt to remove some
unconscious bias on the part of
universities. UCAS says ethnic
minority applicants are up since
2006, but that it is keen to increase
“participation from disadvantaged
groups”.
