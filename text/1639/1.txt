It's harder to get into
Imperial if you're black
Huge gap between offers and applicants from
black and disadvantaged backgrounds even when
they’re predicted the same grades
U
CAS has released data
that shows Imperial
is one of the country’s
worst offenders in terms
of giving fewer offers to black and
poorer students.
UCAS’ data shows that in
2015, 2014 and 2012, there was a
statistically significant difference
between the offer rate for black
applicants and the average offer
rate, even when the smaller number
of black applicants is taken into
account.
Black students in the 2015
June application cycle were 6.5
percentage points less likely to
receive an offer of a place compared
to all applicants applying to the
same course with the same grades.
UCAS says the general trend
across the 130 British universities
surveyed was that there was a
“broadly fair” process of offer-
making. However, Bristol, Oxford,
Cambridge, and Imperial were
some of the few who had large gaps
between the offer rate applicants’
grades and subjects would predict,
and the actual offer rate for students
from disadvantaged backgrounds.
LastyearatImperial,thosecoming
from the most disadvantaged
backgrounds were 4.2% less likely to
get an offer than you’d expect from
their grades and subjects. Our stats
are slightly worse than Cambridge’s,
where students from the most
disadvantaged groups are only 3.7%
less likely to get a place.
On the other side, at Imperial,
applicants from the most
advantaged group were 2.3 points
more likely to be awarded an offer,
and when you look at the random
variability considering the number
of applicants and the average offer,
this is unlikely to have happened
by chance. Again, Imperial is even
more likely than Cambridge to
give offers to the most privileged
applicants.
UCAS used something called
the POLAR3 classification to
define students’ socioeconomic
background. This grouping puts
students into five equal sized
groups from the most to the
least advantaged, by how many
are involved in higher education,
with quintile one being the most
disadvantaged...
