Brb, I’m drowning in cocktails
FELIX attends a cocktail launch at Shoryu SoHo
T
he lives of successful
bloggers have always
appeared somewhat
glamourous, superficial
and materialistic to me – press events
around the world, nights in 5-star
hotels, sponsorships from high-
end brands… And all they seem
to do for a living is just go take a
few effortless photos for #ootd, film
a humble #haul video showcasing
their latest luxury purchases, ending
the day off with a sleepy #nomakeup
#selfie on Instagram. All this was
happening while I’m slaving away in
the totally unglam Central Library
facing debt and unemployment. I
know. Life is unfair.There, there.
As some of you may know, I am
actually a blogger myself, disguised
as a Chemical Engineering student
running up and down ACEX every
day.I am by no means famous in any
way, but with a year of slow growing
exposure in the world of social
media, I have finally landed my first
taster of that mysterious lifestyle:
a summer cocktail press event
at Shoryu, a hip Japanese ramen
restaurant/cocktail bar owned by
Japan Centre with various locations
including SoHo, Covent Garden,
Liverpool Street and Carnaby
Street.
To be exact, it was, according to
the PR manager who contacted
me personally a few weeks before,
a two-hour Summer Cocktails and
Masterclass Blogger Event held in
their SoHo branch conveniently
in the evening after my last exam
(woohoo!). All complete with
an opportunity to “interact with

fellow press people in the industry”,
while tasting their “delicious range
of Japanese cocktails alongside
a delicate array of exquisite
accompaniments”. Also known as
free food, free booze, and party in
student language.
After a shy peek through the main
entrance, I was greeted by a friendly
manager who quickly led me
through the restaurant and down
to the secretive, dimly lit basement
which housed the press room.
It was more of an intimate
event than the big, fancy party I
had imagined. Two tables were
beautifully set with mini cocktail
glasses,side plates and chopsticks all
ready for the proceeding drinking
and dining.
The bar manager, who has worked
in Japan and has thorough expertise
in all things sake (a Japanese
wine made by fermenting rice),
introduced us to the history of the
restaurant and her inspirations for
her four summer creations, pouring
in the various components into her
cocktail shaker as she spoke. The
waitresses dished out bowls of sea-
salted edamame, plates of freshly
made California rolls, and platters
of their signature pork belly buns to
compliment the alcohol.
The cocktails were, of course,
strongly influenced by Japanese
flavours and summer fruits. Even
the names had Japanese references.
First up was Akai Rhubarb (with
akai meaning red in Japanese),
with shots of Josen sake, Bombay
gin, and Aperol, shaken hard with
homemade rhubarb syrup, served in
a white wine glass and two rhubarb
stalks. Like the name, the cocktail
was a beautiful light red with
bittersweet notes.
Next was Natsu No Watermelon
(meaning summer watermelon).
Fresh watermelon and strawberry
juice was mixed with Cointreau
and Shochu (a Japanese distilled
alcohol) and served in a martini
glass with a sprig of orange peel.
Strong, but fruity, juicy and fresh
tasting in a sunset coral red, perfect
when paired with their tonkotsu
ramen.
The third cocktail, my favourite,
was Nikkei Rose, made from
namasake (unpasteurized sake),
Pisco, fresh grapefruit juice, syrup,
and rosewater in coupe glass with
two dried roses floating on top.This
was in a delicate pastel pink, mild
and sweet, designed to be paired
with sushi.
Finally, Mango Suppai (suppai
means sour). This was probably the
mostcomplexintermsofingredients
and flavour. Yuzu Umeshu (yuzu is
an oriental citrus fruit and Umeshu
is a liqueur made from steeping
plums in Shochu) is infused with
genmai tea (also known as popcorn
tea here) beforehand, then shaken
with Frangelico hazelnut liqueur,
Josen sake, and fresh mango, served
in a rocks glass embellished with
blackberries and a single bamboo
leaf. A surprising balance between
the sweet mango and nutty
Frangelico on the palette.
Shots of the cocktails were served
for all to try and the remaining
time was free for us to socialize
and to take photos. It was the first
time I felt completely relaxed with
my blogging business. The hidden,
embarrassed photo-taking sessions
transformed into bold, stand-up,
hipster style aerial shots, perfect for
#tablesituation.
The event quickly came to an end.
We were sent home with generous
goodie bags and a bottle of Matcha
Cool Down (matcha green tea
mixed with Malibu). After talking
to a few honest people who actually
blog as a career, I realized that my
perceptions of this social media
lifestyle was completely wrong. It
isn’t as easy and glamourous as it
appears to be on the pages of those
glossy magazines. Not everyone can
become famous overnight – many
built up their reputation by years of
dedication, commitment and hard
work. It means constantly paying
attention to the trends, comments,
reviews, and discovering new places
that no one has been to before,
and brainstorming new ideas for
captions or articles or videos. Not
every photo or video is perfect –
that 10-minute video could have
taken hours of preparation, filming
and editing. That effortless #ootd
photo may not be so effortless after
all.
Taking account of all the risks
involved in working in social media,
would I still continue with blogging
and developing my hobby into a
potential career? I certainly would.
