s it easier for a girl to get
a partner at Imperial?
Possibly. 42% of self-
identified lads were single,
as opposed to just 28%
of the ladies. Just over half
of everyone was in a ‘you’re-
not-allowed-to-shag-anyone-
else’ arrangement. 12% of
those asked were in a seeing
multiple people or one person
non-exclusively.
Sexting
I
t’s 2016, and you don’t
have time to have actual
sex. A whopping 44% of
you say you like sexting,
and half of those of you in
monogamous relationships
say you do it on the regular,
whereas a mighty 75%
of you who are seeing
multiple people are fans
of this particular method
of sexytimes. As for
your methods, the
overwhelming winner is
Snapchat. Of those of
you who said you were
into sending dirty pics,
56% used Snapchat. The
next most popular medium
was Whatsapp, with the
good old-fashioned text
coming in third. Presumably
the inherent risk of accidentally
publishing a picture of your dick out
meant that only 17% of those asked
said they used Facebook messenger to
send their tasteful nudes.
Sexual health
T
his year, we put a
particular focus on
your contraception
habits. Folks
who said they’d
had a one night stand were
way more likely to have had
unprotected sex: 75% in
comparison to 55%. Across
all surveyed, two thirds of
you have had unprotected
sex. Have you lot even been
reading the paper this year?
Safe sex is best.
An eye-watering 44% of
you said you’d never had
an STI test, but only 4% of
all respondents admitted to
having had an STI. 21% of
you said you got tested every
time you switched partners,
and 19% said they only
bothered if they were worried
about the sexual health of a
new partner. Those seeing
multiple people were the best
at getting semi-regular STI
tests – 70% had had one in
the last year.
69% (giggle) of those
relying on the pill to stop
them becoming mums and
dads were in monogamous
relationships, and
unsurprisingly, condoms
were the contraception
options of choice. After these
two, pulling out was the
most popular ‘method’ of
contraception respondents
said they relied upon. You
know this doesn’t work,
right? Perhaps most
worryingly, the 20% of the
medics who responded said
they had used pulling out to
prevent pregnancy. Two little
words for you, baby doctors.
Pre. Cum.
Sex on campus
19%ofyoureportedhaving
had sex on campus, with
particular spikes in
Blackett Laboratory,
SAF and the Huxley
Building. However,
the most popular
on campus spot
for a cheeky
shag was the
union building,
including the
union offices, with
a whopping 27% of
those who said they’d
had sex on campus
reported to have boned
there.
In terms of contentedness
with your sex lives, the
vast majority of you were
happy or very happy, with
the happiest of you in Civil
Engineering (who are also
the ones having the most
one night stands – just
saying). Those in EEE and
Computing were the least
happy, with 33% of each
course saying they were
either
u n h a p p y
or very unhappy with their
sex lives.
Contrary to what you might
think, most responders
didn’t think Imperial had
negatively affected their
sex lives, with 35%
of responders
saying they
thought being at

What are you into?
A
huge 48% of
you said you
didn’t even
want to try
receiving anal,
whilst the departments
where butt stuff is most
popular were ESE and
Mechanical Engineering,
where 20% said they liked
it. On the whole, people
seemed more up for the
idea of giving anal, with 15%
saying they would try it.
46% of you want to
try having a threesome,
with 18% of Chemical
Engineering saying they
knew they liked it already.
This was far more popular
with male respondents. 38%
of women, in comparison to
just 11% of men said they
didn’t want to try it. Similarly,
the idea of orgies was much
more appealing to men, of
which 36% wanted to try
it, compared to just 14% of
women.
Pretty much everyone is
into, or at least into the idea
of restraints – with both
making up two thirds of the
voters. 22% of you didn’t
want to try public sex with a
pretty even split on gender.
After sexting, sex toys were
the most mainstream thing
you liked, with 35% of
people saying they
liked it, and 30%
saying they
wanted to
try it.
not had changed their
luck either way. Female
responders were a few
percentage points higher
than men in saying that
being at Imperial had
positively affected their sex
lives, whilst slightly more
men than women said
going here had damaged
their game.
The majority of students
in every department said
they did have time to meet
people whilst studying,
excet in the Business
School, where 67%
they struggled
to fit that into
their busy
schedules.
