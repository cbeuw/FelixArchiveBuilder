Imperial taught me how to be a better DJ
It might not go on your CV, but here's my advice on an invaluable life skill
Pietro Aronica

his will be my final article
for FELIX, as, after
nearly nine years, my
time has come to leave
Imperial. This newspaper has been
an important part of my experience
here, back from the very first copy I
acquired in freshers’ week and kept
because it had the instructions on
how to operate washing machines.
FELIX has given me much,
though I never figured out at which
point of the cycle you have to put
the softener in, and it has afforded
me space for some rambling articles
that wouldn’t be out of place on
an unread hipster blog, but which
thanks to FELIX allow me to add
“amateur journalist/writer” to my
CV and keep a straight face.
It has given me so much that
perhaps I can try to give something
back; maybe I can pass my wisdom
to the next generation on one of
the skills I have found most useful
during my time here: DJ-hood.
Let’s say you’re at a party, or in the
laboratory,or in some other location
where Spotify or an iPod has been
hooked up and music is being
played. Sure, you could let that
playlist go on until it gets to those
bands with more glockenspiels than
followers, but isn’t it better to stand
next to a computer all night, trying
to come up with a new song every
three minutes?
Here's my
first tip:
never put
any kind of
metal on

Your first instinct might be to put
on music that you like, and if you’re
like many people at Imperial you
might want to put some metal on.
Here’s my first tip: never put any
kind of metal on. No Maiden, no
Metallica, no Priest. It’s long and
riff-heavy and screamy and generally
not good for casual gatherings
of people – unless it’s specifically
metal fans, in which case metal will
already be on. Good job, go back to
drinking.
The same usually goes for techno,
dance and electronic music. In most
contexts, it won’t be any good unless
people are drunk and dancing, in
which case anything with a strong,
fast, repetitive bassline will do. The
Prodigy tends to be appropriate
in these circumstances, as a lot of
people will recognise their songs
even if they are not especially
familiar with them.
That is the key to being a good iPod
DJ: good but recognisable songs. It
doesn’t matter if it’s something you
personally ended up loving after
the twentieth repeat, slightly tipsy
people will enjoy a song more if they
can vaguely remember the words to
it and hum out the tune. Most of
The Beatles fall into this category,
as does virtually everything on
Michael Jackson’s Thriller.
Songs that appeal to '90s kids'
include 'Smells Like Teen Spirit',
'Song 2' and 'The Rockafeller
Skank'; other older but well known
pieces are 'Should I Stay Or Should I
Go', 'Superstition', 'Fortunate Son',
'Satisfaction', and many others. The
absolute king of this class of songs
is 'Don’t Stop Me Now' by Queen,
which virtually everyone knows and
loves and will dance to. And I can
also guarantee you that everyone
will be dancing to the 'Infernal
Galop' by Offenbach.
But don’t get too hung up on the
specific songs: there are just too
many to recount here.Build a mental
library of good pieces, switch up the
genres and, most importantly, look
at the people. If they’re bouncing,
tapping their feet, singing along,
then it means you’re doing a good
job; if not, switch it up, change type
of song, try something else.
Or maybe you could mingle
with others and talk to them
instead of trying to dictate what
everyone listens for the night.
Rather than getting hung up on the
entertainment, you could actually
get to know other people and dance
with them instead of staying in the
corner and watching them dance?
Nah. I was the iPod DJ most of
the time, and it ended up alright
for me. I’m writing for FELIX an
article that can be summed up as
“Good songs are good”: does it get
any better than this?
So goodbye, Imperial and
Imperialites, I hope that I might
have entertained you at some point
and taught you something. So long,
and be good.
Switch up
the genres
and, most
importantly,
look at the
people

The inevitable reign of Boris
Voting leave will push this country in a very dangerous direction
Samuel Read

P
revious comment articles
have outlined how there are
progressive, liberal reasons
to leave the EU. Shadowy
TTIP lowering our standards
of welfare and increasing the
influence of US megacorporations
behind closed doors. Imperialist
attitudes towards an EU superstate
such as those of former European
Commission president José Manuel
Barroso: “I like to compare the EU
as a creation to the organisation of
empire. We have the dimension of
empire.”
Last but not least, the treatment
of the Greek people,who repeatedly
have austerity forced down their
throats in the name of the EU ideal
of neocapitalism.
The lack of democracy exhibited
above can only be outdone
by the sheer ineptitude of the
democratic system we face at home,
however, and it’s the effect that
this referendum will have on our
domestic affairs that we really need
to worry about. After all, the House
of Commons Library determines
that an “average of 13.2% of UK
instruments are EU-related” (with
"instruments" referring to laws, acts
and regulations). We need to focus
on the 86.8% that we make.
With the SNP controlling 54 of
the 59 seats in the former labour
stronghold of Scotland, and the
Murdoch press (who have backed
every general election victor since
1979) thoroughly blue,the prospects
of a Labour win at the next general
election seem bleak. So bleak, in
fact, that as someone who considers
himself at the very least left-leaning,
I find myself genuinely caring for
the first time in my life about which
seemingly interchangeable ‘old boy’
leads the Tories.
Does anyone benefit from #sabblife?
The sabbs are a financial drain
on college and an emotional
drain on everyone around them
A vote to leave the EU would be
seen by all as a massive vote of no
confidence in Cameron’s Britain.
The disarmingly likable buffoonery
of Boris would be vindicated. He
would undoubtedly become leader
of the Conservative party before the
year was out.
Nobody knows what Boris really
stands for – he is unquestionably
populist in his approach to politics.
It is the harshness of his fellow
conservative leave campaigners
(who will all be in line for massive
promotions should we vote to
leave) that I fear: Michael Gove, a
proud Zionist, NHS hater and pro-
intervention zealot; and Priti Patel,
a thinly-veiled lobbyist for the
tobacco and alcohol industries.
I never thought I’d find myself in
a position where I’d be clamouring
for the longevity of Dodgey Dave,
but that’s the situation I find myself
in now. If you thought the cuts were
bad with Dave in charge, just you
wait till Gove, Johnson & Co. get
their hands on the country’s assets.

S
abbatical officers at every
university are the same.
They’re all self-important,
egotistical, and narcissistic,
with an inflated sense of the
importance of their role. They enter
this multi-generational circle-jerk
of sabbs, stroking each other’s egos
and sucking each other’s dicks, both
literally and metaphorically.
Some of our sabbatical officers are
great: they care about the students,
and they manage to implement
some changes during their year in
the role. But let’s face it, most of
them don’t. Most of them spend
the year sitting in meetings they
don’t contribute to, drinking in
the union bar as early as they can
possibly get away with,and building
relationships with the rest of the
Beit Quad Cartel, which ends up
being a pool of people that they will
fuck throughout the next few years
until they fade into insignificance.
And why is it that we pay them so
much money to do this?
Having sabbatical officers is great,
in theory. Having ‘students’ who
engage with the mechanics of the
Union and represent the interests
of the student body is essential
to its function. But the Union
itself strangles this intention by
preventing the sabbs from having
any real power to make even slight
changes to anything, while at the
same time telling them constantly
that they are all-important. What
this means is that instead of actually
helping students, they delude their
smug selves into thinking that
they’re making a difference when
all they’re actually doing is adding
to the incestuous links on the sabb
sex map.
As students, we don’t really gain
much from them apart from the
incorrect, yet comforting idea that
maybe someone might be looking
out for our interests. Are the sabbs
at least gaining anything from
their year in power? Does being a
sabbatical officer act as a training
centre for the real world?
Being a sabb looks great on your
CV, for sure. You probably do gain
some #transferableskills that will
help you in a future workplace
environment, although in this case,
these are mostly 1) wearing suitable
work attire instead of jeans and
a ripped freebie t-shirt, 2) being
able to show up to work at 9am
even when you’re still drunk from
the night before, and 3) being
arrogant enough to assume that
any contributions you make in this
condition are worthwhile.
But beyond becoming entitled
enough to think that this role makes
them a better person, sabbs seem
to suffer for their year. For many
of them, their mental health goes
downhill, their grades take a swift
nosedive (if they are undertaking
this year in the middle of their
degree), and god only knows how
many STIs are being passed back
and forth as ex-sabbs shag in various
permutations at every Union social
event that they still feel the need to
attend despite their long being old
news.
As an entity spanning beyond
their year of service, sabb culture is
bleak. So many of them stay stuck
in the Imperial College Union circle
forever, because they can’t exist in
the real world because there, no one
cares what they’re doing.
They enter
this multi-
generational
circle-jerk of
sabbs
