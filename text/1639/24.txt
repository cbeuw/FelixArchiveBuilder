ARTS
Royal Academy Summer Exhibition

T
he Summer Exhibition
at the Royal Academy
is a bit like Glastonbury
of the arts world, if the
people who went were 97% white
with a mean age of sixty.Along with
fixtures like Wimbledon, it heralds
in the summer, bringing together
established artists from all the
different disciplines: printmaking,
painting, sculpture, video, while
offering a platform for the work of
lesser known artists and amateurs
through the open submission policy.
Each year, a single sculpture in
the courtyard sets the tone for
each exhibition, and this year the
space has been given to Ron Arad’s
creation, ‘Spyre’. It is a towering,
rotating artist’s mannequin arm
that moves its joints at random
The tip of the sculpture carries a
small camera that records its field
of vision. The swooping images of
sky, building, and exhibition-goers,
seen as though through the eyes of
a bird flying, and diving through the
courtyard are replayed on a giant
screen that spans the entrance to
the Royal Academy. It’s innovative,
unusual, and focuses on the process
of making art, a theme that the
artist as someone who works alone.
The collaborative effort of creating
art is highlighted in the central hall
which contains the glittering neon
sign by Noble and Webster, and also
features a fossilized petrol pump by
Allora & Calzadilla.
Increasingly, the Summer
Exhibition mutates according to
the coordinator in charge. Last year,
Michael Craig-Martin painted
the walls in neon colours; pink and
turquoise. This year the walls have
stayed white, presumably in order
to let the works shine. Whether all
the works on display are shining
examples of great art is up for debate.
The quality of the work varies
wildly from room to room, which
have been broadly designated by
medium.Two print rooms lead onto
a space for photography, another
for architecture, whilst sculpture is
placed throughout the gallery and
gets a rooms all of its own.
Over 1200 works have been
selected for exhibition. The sheer
volume means that the works are
hung piled on top of each other,
several to one square foot of wall
space. From a distance, this gives
the gallery space a busy, vibrant
feel, almost cosy. It does mean that
the smaller works get lost amongst
the bigger hangs, and can be easily
missed.
The hang also reveals the skewed
rendered in photogravure, a type
of printmaking. These are hasty
productions,fluid,but messy,wholly
unexceptional. Had they been
anonymised before being sent in,
they would without a doubt never
have been exhibited, yet they hang
in pride of place.The frame is lined
with tiny red dots that signify that
nearly 50 people are willing to
cough up over a thousand pounds to
get their hands on an original Emin,
regardless of quality.
That’s not to say there isn’t
compelling, beautiful work to
be found. Norman Ackroyd’s
series of monochrome prints are
as eye-catching as ever, and have
attracted a series of little red dots
themselves. I was a particular fan
of Olwyn Bowen’s highly textured
botanical paintings, as well as the
minimalistic pencil drawings by the
late Ellsworth Kelly. The Singh
Brothers’ take on the subject of
the London riots in the style of
illuminated medieval manuscripts is
a gorgeous swirl of mustard yellows,
and scarlet with a sense of humour;
Boris Johnson comes charging in
from the top corner, broom in hand.
If the quality of the paintings
has decreased from last year, then
sculpture has fared better. Sure
there’s the weird; a disquietingly
fluffy tarantula, a grey, very detailed
sculpture of Iggy Pop.In a conscious
effort to be edgier, Michael Stokes
has created tiny, very explicit,
pornographic, sculptures. They
are veering on the grotesque, and
deeply uncomfortable to look at,
but that’s beside the point. What’s
worse is that they seem to serve no
higher purpose than to shock with
its X-rated content.
This summer’s headline event showcases the work of artistic duos
the process it took for the creation
of this sculpture earlier in the year,
and appreciated the small army of
craftspeople it took to bring the
sculpture to life from a series of
sketches.
For others, it is the placement that
allows the work to carry weight.
Laura Ford’s ‘Silent Howler’ is a
bronze of a small girl sobbing into
her hands. She’s placed just at the
edge of a doorway, head buried
in her hands, looking impossibly
forlorn. One could almost mistake
the sculpture for a real child who’s
lost their parents in the bustle of the
crowd.
One of the most memorable is a
shipping container stands in the
middle of another room. Look
closer, and there are several tiny
round windows to peer through.
The scene inside the container is
one of destruction. A tiny scaled
down suspension bridge has
collapsed, tiny scaled down cars are
either falling into the river below, or
stand abandoned at the side. Tiny,
scaled down police officers survey
the damage. Blue lights flash. This
glimpse into a Lilliputian land is
oddly transformative.
For me, the most impressive was
another sculpture. Kutluğ Ataman’s
‘The Portrait of Sakıp Sabancı’
hangs over gallery one like an
enormous blue cloud. It is vaguely
reptilian, made of ten thousand
scales of LED monitors that glow
and flicker to display a mass portrait
of all the people that the late
Turkish businessman Sakip Sabanci
encountered in his life. There are
family members here, friends,
colleagues; the whole population
of his life. It took three years to

face. Works by the established artists
are hung with more generosity, even
when the work itself is lacking.This
is particularly evident in the case
of Tracey Emin’s quick drawings
come together.
It also highlights the best that
the Summer Exhibition can be. The

Ataman’s work is housed are densely

There are treasures to be found
too. Aono Fumiaki’s beautiful
rendering of old Japanese books
moulding into old vases are small,
but perfectly crafted. By contrast,
Yinka Shonibare’s ‘Balloon Man’
is huge; a life-size, garishly dressed
man with a round featureless head,
trying to keep his balance on a tall
white plinth as a bouquet of helium
balloons tied to his waist threaten to
lift him off the ground completely.

filled with work from the open
submission, many of it as differet as

landscapes, traditional domestic
works. The Summer Exhibition
skips through the different styles,
and movements of art lithely,
sometimes, stumbling, sometimes
soaring. It can be overwhelming
to walk into a gallery that trying
to be everything to everyone, but
it generates the spirit of discovery.
It allows visitors to enjoy art they
wouldn’t have paid to see exhibited
on its own, and gives established
artists freedom to explore beyond
their usual techniques and subject
matter. You might not find yourself
enjoying everything in the Summer
Exhibition, but that’s the point.
It’s celebratory, filled with unusual
work displayed in unusual ways, and
always surprising. That chance of
discovering something completely
unexpected alone is worth the ticket
price.
Until 12th
August at the Royal
Academy. Tickets from £12.
