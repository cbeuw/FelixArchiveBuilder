\CLUB REVIEW/
F L E C L U B
The history of tne Rifle Club
goes baok to 1901 when the Engineers
Cup for Interoallege shooting was van
by I.C. i n the second year of the com-
petition. Sinoe than the cup has re-
turned to I.C. many times, inoluding
six times i n the last seven years.
The present home of the club la
a beauty-five yard range in a cellar
under the Unwin building, and ia not
a continuation of the tunnel from
South Kan. Station. This cellar i s
also used aa one means of aooeas to
tha adjacent boiler room. Consequently
shooting i s sometimes interrupted by
workmen who, despite the safety pre-
cautions, Insist on walking through
between the firing point and tha tar-
gets.
At times during last year shootxag
was further interrupted by flood water
from the nearby building site, whioh
f i l l e d the whole range to a depth of
several laches.. It was suggested that
oertain people might do better i f they
aimed at the reflection of the targets
ia tha water, but tola was disoouregsd.
In an effort to brighten up the
range many souvenirs have bean col-
lected over tha years and various rag
trochlea now adorn tha valla. Of course
these are a l l removed and oarsfully hid-

The last of this series of mock
parliaments was held i n the Ayr-ton Hall
last Thursday evening. This time a Com-
munist Government waa i n office and tha
Conservatives vera the aaia Opposition
party.
The peril meant was opened by tha
Queen who read a speech beginning, "As
this i s the last time I shall be addres-
sing you . . . " sad continued by out-
lining the Government's proposed elect-
oral reforms. On theae tha Opposition
did not oall for a division, but did so
for tha abolition of the Monarchy and
the Bouse of Lords, on whioh motion tha
Cm element was has i l l y defeated. The
Queen, on belag re-instated, assmaid

Mo doubt there are many who prefer
to listen to recorded Jams, but for real
enjoyment Jass has to be played. The
Jess Club activities this term have at
last bees widened to •itytiiy^ porfaraanoea
of lunch hour concerts, as v e i l as the
usual record recitals.
The f i r s t Jass Concert was held
on Thursday Jan 30th i n the Concert
Ball and a oertain amount of trepi-
dation was experienced by the organi tiers
in wondering i f they would get any sup-
port at a l l . However, a l l their fears
were groundless, as by about 2 p.a.,
250 people were i n the Concert Hall and
a l l obviously enjoying the music. Tha
I.C. Jass Band, playing a traditional
stylSj started rather frigidly but soon
iaprevwd during i t s f i r s t 3 numbers.
The skiffle group played 3 numbers but
were unfortunately not appreciated by
tarn audience. Modern J u s came from
an impromptu quintet whioh was spoilt
by a. oertain amount of lack of cohesion
within the group. The Jass Band played
for the final 15 minutes and this time
really got going, ao much so i n fact
that they had to play an encore.
In view of the success of the f i r s t
concert a second one was held on Thurs-
day Feb. 20th. This time the musicians
were relaxed and soon got over the ner-
vousness vhioh marred parts of the f i r s t .
concert and a f u l l hour and a quarter of
traditional, modern and 'Jump' music was
produced. The modern Jass waa pi ov lead
by a newly formed quintet ooaprising,
L. Hodgson (clarinet), R. Ruehton (piano),
L. Irons (baas), G» Prltohard (drums)
and J. Farnsvroth (guitar), and i n ad-
dition a mainstream group, led by an
'ageing zoologist", provided some oomsdy
for the audience.
The various outfits hare recently
played at a number of outside functions;
the Jass Band at tha Inter-University
Qaataat at Bristol where they vere
season but certainly not disgraced, aad
also at the Iheaphroy Lyttleton Club,
the Modern group at Beford College as
well aa at hops at L.C.
There i s no doubt that with the
wealth of talent that exists i n the
College, the outlook is vary bright
and the only difficulty now, is in be-
ing able to aoooaaedate everyone who
wishes to play i n acme form of group.
