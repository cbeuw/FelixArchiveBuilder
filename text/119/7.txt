People leering the hop early two
wools ago had their entertainment
rounded off by an excellent pageant put
on outside the Union by the L.C.C. Fire
Brigade.
A woman talcing her dog for a walk
had apparently noticed a flickering
light in a top floor window of the
Eoderio H i l l Building and made a 999
c a l l , and generally 3et the wires a-
buxx. Meanwhile the Rod. Hill porter
made his rounds in blissful ignorance
as his phone rang unheeded.
Not to be put off, four fire
engines arrived i n Prince Consort Road
and an intrepid fireman ascended a
turntable ladder while a dozen young
maidens held their breath. Having
oompleted their inspection the Brigade
withdrew as did a couple of Black Marias
whioh had turned up, perhaps by force of
habit.
The Porter told our reporter that
the nocturnal glow is due to firey im-
plements of some research workers and
is a nlcrhtly phenomenon. However what
the research workers thought when a
face peered at them from the outside
of their fourth floor window is not
known.

Last Sunday was the occasion of
the Annual Diesel Railcar Excursion
of the Railway and Engineering Soc-
ieties. The venue this year was the
Swindon Works of British Railways
Western P.eglon; these, the largest
locomotive works in this country,
cover an area of 326 acres and were
erected originally for the Great
Western Pallway at the approximate
half-way point of the London - Bris-
tol run. Many of the original work-
shops are s t i l l in existence, and
these show the massive scale on whioh
Brunei and his fellow engineers
worked.
Some of these shops have
been modernised to a certain extent,
but in view of the forthcoming elec-
trification of the railways there
will be a progressive run-down of the
facilities provided and a gradual con-
version to the servicing of diesel-
mechanical. diesel-electric and elec-
tric locomotives and the associated
rolling stock. At present they are
fabricating low-cost, light-weight
diesel stock on almost production
line methods in that a l l components
are fabricated away from the fitting
bays.
In the locomotive shops many
famous steam locos were in various
stages of repair, some being strip-
ped down to merely the boiler shell
and firebox. T.'odernisation is on
the way however, in that they are
building several Maybaoh dlesel-
meohanioal locos with mech-hydro
transmission under licence from the
German firm. These are of revo^
lutionary construction and at first
sight appear to be of insufficient
strength to stand up,to the E000
drawbar H.P. that they are said to
develop, which shows the excessive
factors of safety that have been
employed in the past in railway
engineering. Although many members
of the Engineering Society who
signed the original l i s t of appli-
cations failed to corns on the visit
those who did turn up spent an en-
joyable, albeit rather tiring, day.
J.K.T.
Give some girls an inch and they're
clothed.
The previous Wednesday the Society
visited the works of the Pullman Car
Co. Ltd. at Preston Park, Brighton.
They saw elaborate veneer work being
renovated, and proposed interior de-
signs of new cars.
Appropriately enough, most of the
party returned on the "Brighton Belle*
but one member, who confessed he'd never
been to Brighton before, stayed behind
to see the sea,

A most successful and enjoyable
evening was had on Wednesday, 26th
February, when Mr. Gerald Durrell, the
well-known animal-collector, author
and broadcaster, was the guest of
honour at the Society's Annual Dinner.
Before the Dinner Mr. Durrell
gave a very entertaining talk, i l l u s -
trated by rapid charcoal sketohes, about
some of the many animals he has oome ac-
ross on his travels.
The seventy-five people attending
the dinner listened to, among others*
Mr. Durrell and Dr. C.A. Pratt, who i s
soon to retire after more than thirty
years in the Botany Departatent.
