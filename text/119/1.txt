An ordinary Union meeting waa held
in the Concert Kail on Thursday march
6th. Once again the refeotory situat-
ion waa raited, and the question of
mascots was also discussed.
Mr. Barber held forth for some
time on the subjeot of eating and food,
both of whioh, he said, were essential .
'lowever, members seemingly come to
aeetings to be entertalnedand| when
they had tired of Mr. Barber, he was
howled down.
i t was suggested from th* floor
that Herbert be done away with and
that a miniature Colcutt tower be con-
structed to serve as a College rag
mascot, but a motion to this effect
was rejected. After some discussion
on what should be done with Herbert,
a motion that he should be placed i n
the bar was carried. Tie. T.C.Smith
asked whether a committee might be set
up to inquire Into the subjeot of rag-
ging. However, Mr. Butters pointed
out that there were unwritten laws
which were usually adhered to.
E X I T M I N E S N I G H T
The audience at the Mines Sight
of the Dramatic Society's production
of "Misery He" distinguished Itself
by an appalling exhibition of bad
manners.
The organised interruptions which
are th* essence of Mines Night were
amusing; but persistent coarseness
and obscenity from irresponsible
element* oau**d much distress to M
the ladles In th* east and l a th*
audience.
It is unlikely that there will b*
any further Mine* Sight*.
Tony Hodgson proposed that at the
end of each academic year the Union
•hould eleot a Provost. His function
would be to entertain the Union, a l -
though i t was not made clear exactly
what was meant by this. The motion
was carried.
The Union Is discontinuing pro-
ceeding* in the matter of the boat
damaged on Hornby Day because "we
do not want to incur the displeasure
of the Wandsworth Borough Council"
as i t is hoped to obtain froc them
permission to extend the Boat House.
Thl* term the l i f t has broken
down eight times. Waygood-Otis are
on to a good thing, repairs often be-
ing carried out after normal working
hours and charged accordingly. The
provision of antl-overloading devices
will cost about £200. Should any
more trcuble be caused, the whole
thing may have to be rebuilt.
Bo, Clem and Jesebel will b* go-
ing to the W.U.S. Carnival at Bedford
early next May. I.C. will be erect-
ing and mennlng a sport-palace.
Political literature has again
been circulated, this time relatlna
to Algeria. It was pointed out that
en-the—spot action by member* would
probably effect the desired desiet-
anee.
An Union card check for the f o l -
lowing Monday was announced.
IMPERIAL COLLEGE ART CLUB
A N N U A L E X H I B I T I O N
WILL BEHELD IN THE LC UNION
EARLY IN THE SUMMER TERM
Imperial College has once again
shown that without any shadow of doubt
i t is the strongest sporting college
in the University. In the past few
week* I C. teams have won the U.L.
Bugby Cup, Blfle ("Engineers") Cup,
a half share in the Boxing ("Blott")
Cup, and come second in the Hyde Park
Road Relay. The result of the latter
event demonstrates that the Cross-
country Club, whioh in December won
the U.L. Cup, can beat any college
or university in the country, with
the single exception of Liverpool.
Although not so fortunate in
their respective cup competitions,
the I.C. Hockey and Soccer clubs
have also enjoyed very successful
seasons.
I . C . - 3 : K I N G S - O
A MOST EXCITING CUP FINAL ENDED WITH
I.C. PROUD HOLDERS OF THE CUP FOR THE
FIFTH TIME IN SEVEN YEARS - A REMARKABLE
RECORD.
A large crowd of supporters (whose
presence was much appreciated by the
team) saw I.C. fight magnificently
against a King's XV whioh won a large
ahar* of the ball,but which could not
equal I.C.'s f i r * in the loose. Bo'
and Jesebel were there - and so was
the I.C. Jasz Band (leader Balaclava
Leston). Mr. Leston will be sorry to
learn that he missed most of the victory
celebrations, which, at the time of
writing (Sunday afternoon) are s t i l l in
progress and show few signs of abating.
Although I.C. won the ball from
hardly a single scrum and very few
line-outs, their vigour in the loose
and sound defence won the day. King'*
had the advantage of a moderate breese
in the first half but failed to score.
The fine touch kicking of Seed and
Heam was a great asset to I.C. Our
forward* ceemed to be atung by their
inferiority in the set scrums and line-
out* into unsurpassed aohlevment* in
all aspect* of loo*e play. The back
row (Gilbert, Wright sad Parker) was
here, there and everywhere, and Evans
and Gibbons, from the front row, were
also very prominent.
In th* seoond half I.C. kept Xing'*
pegged inside their own "twenty-fir*"
almost continuously. King'* repeatedly
gained possession only te find them*
»elve* tackled relentlessly and
harassed so much that they le*t as much
ground as they gained.
Tea admit** from th* end cam* th*
moment of glory. Ted Wright picked the
ball up l a the loose, ran round the
blind side of the scrum, threw th* ball
to Otto Gilbert and John Gibson, she,
betaaea them, dribbled the ball over
the King** line, Gibson (coring th* try
ten yards in from touch. Oggi failed
with the kick.
