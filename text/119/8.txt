A few minutes before the end a break
in the eentre by Xing'* looked terrify-
ingly dangerous, until Peart, I.C.'e
full-back, ended i t with a superb
crash tackle. I.C. immediately resumed
the onslaught, and a burst-through by
Gilbert, well supported by Crosier,
ended a yard short of the King's line.
This was a fine climax to a great
season, and i t was very bad luck that
the I.C. Captain, Barry Lane, was pre-
vented by injury from participating
actively i n the crowning triumph of a
memorable year.
LOST: One small metal man, i n rugby-
playing attitude, who screws into the
l i d of the U.L. Rugger Cup.
WANTED: Some-one who can re-shape,
free of charge, a mass of metal into
the configuration formerly recognizable
as the U.L. Rugger Cup.

P.Bhatnagar, who played for U.L. on
Saturday, brought the total of I.C.B.C.
players who have played for the Univ-
ersity this season to eight. The others
are 7.mantle (U.L,Secretary), A.Powell
(Fixture Secretary), R.C.J.Stanton,
N.G.Holmes, D.M.Rees, M.J.Lofting, and
R.B.Lee,
Without these men, however, the I.C.
l s t , team i s enjoying its best season
for several years, having lost only 5
of i t s 28 matches. Two strong teams
w i l l be sent to the U.L. sixes, and we
are hopeful that one of these will bring
back the Cup, which would make a f i t t i n g
end to the season.

CROSSCOUNTRY
On Wed. March 5th. the Club defeated
London Hospital in an away match.
Landbeok and Collins successfully drop-
ped the leader of the opposition, and
ran in together for f i r s t place.
The f i r s t team defeated Cranwell on
8th. March, but lost to l&locarlana.
The race was run on a flat 5-mile course
near the Cranwell airfield, i n a blizz-
ard. Collins was 2nd. and Conway 4th.
in a f i e l d of 20. On the same date a
rather weak second team lost to
Bancrofts School over a muddy 5j -mils
course in Epping Forest.

The tenth Hyde Park Road Relay on lst.
March was the usual great success. It
waa quite obvious that, with 42 teams
running, including some of the best
athletes i n the country, records were
suri to go. The pace was set from the
start by Shaw (B'ham), who sped round
the 2f -mile course in 13m. 6s. So hat
was the pace in this first lap that the
first 15 men were under 14 mins. John
Collins ran a magnificent leg for I.C.
handing over to J-F.Jaeger In 4th.

held his plaee well, gaining on Liver-
pool who had moved into the lead. Only
4 sees, separated the leading five
teams at this point, and Jaeger handed
over to Dave Briggs after doing an
excellent time of 14:00. Save quickly
went into the lead, only to be over-
taken by Adams (Sheffield).
•0i t
Jean Conway took over from Brings
(who did 13:37), rapidly passed the
Sheffield man, and retained the lead
for the rest of the lap, sending John
Evans on his way with a 10 yd. lead.
(Conway's time: 13:33). Evans, with
the second best time of the day (13:01)
built up a big lead. A feature of this
lap was the amasing run by Martyn Hymen
(Southampton) who returned 12m, 39s, to
break the lap record by 16 sees. This
tremendous performance means that Hymen
should be within 20 seconds of the

Roger Landbeck went away on the final
lap with the cheers of about 200 I.C.
supporters speeding him on, but before
Hyde Park Corner Wesenoraft (Liverpool)
had caught and passed him. Roger gave
chase, and from Victoria Gate was
gaining on the Liverpool man, but I.C.
had once more to be content with 2nd.

This shattered the previous record of
82:28 set up by Loughborough in 1956.
Southampton, 3rd. in 81:51, and Lough-
borough, 4th. in 82:26, also beat the
previous record.
Of the other London Colleges, L.S.E.
were 9th., U.C. 11th,, King's 18th.,
Guy's 20th., and Q.M.C. 23rd. The
Imperial College Union Cup for Colleges
of less than 500 men was won by Selwyn

The Wooden Spoon was gloriously won by
Sir John Csss College.

won the ENGINEERS CUP. Although the
results of the final round are not yet
known, i t i s oertain that the 'A' team
has won the 1st. Division with a record

on the way to winning the 3rd. and
Novices Divisions and one of the lower
Divisions in the County of London
League.

As the season i s drawing towards
its end, the l s t XI have lost the goal-
scaring power which was an encouraging
feature of the earlier games of the
season. Ironioally, the team have
played good football recently. Suf-
ficient goals were scored to beat
L.S.E. 2 - 1 , and draw with Christ's
Coll. Camb. 4 - 4 , but i n recent
matches with King's College, I.C. out-
played the opposition for long periods
but could not turn the superiority i n -
to goals and in the end i t was King's
who demonstrated how to convert a few
chances into as many goals.
The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th XIs have
been unbeaten in the last 28 matches,
the chief credit being due to the 3rd
XI who have not been beaten since Nor.
16th. The result of this excellent
record i s that the 4th XI have gained
promotion, the 3rd XI are champions of
division II of the intercollegiate
league, and compete next season in
division I with the 2nd XI, who need
to win the next two games to win the
Div. I championship.
Recent visits have been made to
Oxford and Cambridge. The l s t and
2nd teams were entertained by Christ's
(Camb.) and the following week the 3rd
and 4th visited New Coll. and Brasenose
Oxford, whilst Brasenose l s t were
trounced and entertained by the 2nd XI
in London. Judging by reports of these
excursions, I.C. men considerably en-
livened Oxford and Cambridge.
On Sunday, 23rd February, two
teams played a soccer "sport" match
v. the Rugby Club. Both games pro-
vided amusement for a l l concerned.
Having won the soccer battle the d u b
await the return match at rubgy with
much trepidation and l i t t l e
knowledge of the rules.
On Saturday 8th March, I.C. staged
a six-a-side competition for Kensington
Colleges, including R.C.A. and C.E.M.
Fortunately the Stephens Shield
remains at I.C. i n the possession Of
R.C.6. whose "A* team won the final
against C. <
£ G. "B". The losers com-
petition was again won by R.C.S. "C".
Altogether i t was a most enjoyable
afternoon'a soccer and good practice
for the University sixes on 15th March.
