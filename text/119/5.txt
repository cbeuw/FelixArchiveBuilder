BARTON DEFENDED
Dear S i r ,
I waa aaTpriaod to read l a your
last issue that Brof. Barton expects
his students to work seventy hours par
week. As a asaber of his department,
I feel X Bust point out that he has
never stated suoh a figure, or anything
like i t . Normal working hours in the
department are a l l that he has asked
for, namely 9.30 a.m. - 6.0 p.m., five
days a weak. A figure of 60 hours per
week has been mentioned for another de-
partment; this i s gross, and lnolmmae
time for reading, calculating, lunch,
natural functions, eto.
As to the implication that Barton
is narrow-minded and thinks only of
chemistry, this is completely untrue.
Of ocurse, he i s interested i n his sub-
ject, otherwise he couldn't be one of
th* best onanists i n the world, hot
ana only has to look i n Who's-Who to
see his rang* of interests. He i s
also married, with a family, so he
has obvious outside activity. In any
oase, is i t not rather bad tast* to
lannoh what amounted to a personal at-
tack on a man who, a fortnight previous-
ly, had l e f t on a three month leotur*
tour of th* United States?
Tours faithfully,
Organic Chemist.
Editor's note:
As one would expect, the damsnil
for a seventy-hour week was not mads
in front of a olass and i s not o f f i c i a l
policy of the Organic Chemistry depart-
ment. Nonetheless, i t has bean iapros-
,s*d on our informants, by personal con-
tact with Professor Barton i n the lab.
and in tutorials, that his post-grad-
mate students are expected to work a
seventy-hour weak.
W
e did not imply that Professor
Barton was narrow-minded; we did
state that suoh demands were guaranteed
to produce narrow minds. We wish that
we did not have to consult "Who's Who"
to discover his range of interests.
One doean t just work i n an university;
one i s part, of i t . It i s a pity that
so few p*opl* seem to realise this.
W
e greatly regret that oar article
ooinoideu with Professor Barton's
lecture tour i n the U.S.A. Bad w

aware of his impending absence, aa
would have b rought this matter up

FOUR YEAR COURSE
Dear S i r ,
Congratulations en your leader
"Problem of the oa* track mind*. I t
oontainad sen* of th* bast-thought-out
eomaants on this matter that have yet
appeared.
Th* suggestion that the governors
b* foroed te resign unless they mot t *
remedy the present situation, goes
straight te th* heart of the problem.
However, I sew l i t t l e ohano* of the
resignation of any ef th* present
goweiuoi* and, to my mind, the best
line of attack would be to try to
m
a
J
o
» them see th* probable oonaequeao*
of a oontinuatian of the present system..
The present drive for more sad
batter technical education means that
there w i l l soon be nor* institutions
of a similar natur* t * I.C. At present
I.C. owes i t s lead in the field of
technical education almost entirely t *
its academic superiority. If w
*
oontinu* as wa are nor w
* shall cease
to be th* best College of Solano* and
Technology and become merely the big-
gest, i f that. He, I.C. can only keep
its lead by turning out true intellect-
ual leaders, not *highly-trained morons".
Another problem whioh can be tack-
led at top level i s apathy, both real
and apparent, of the students. Many
students have l i t t l * time for non-
academic activities simply because
of the sheer quantity of work which
is heaped upon them. Furthermore,
many get to the state in whioh they
simply do not want to Include i n
their relaxation anything involving
intellectual effort(havw yon ever
tried to persuade anyone to go to a
Touchstone weekend?) Hence to genuine
apathy, whioh undoubtedly does exist,
is added this "apparent apathy" whioh
is in fact as frustrating to the student
as i t i s bad for th* College. A possible
remedy has been suggested i n PHOENIX -
extend the present undergraduate course
to cover four years. It is signi-
ficant that some of the more progres-
siva provincial Universities already
have four year courses in Science and
engineering. I.C. must follow suit
eventually, and the sooner the better.
These and other problems will,
however, i an*.In unsolved unless th*
governors make an effort. It i s ap
to the student body aa a whole to de
its utmost to make i t olear te them
what changes are naoessary and why.
Only by doing this oen w
* remedy our
situation.
Tear* faithfully,
Anthony L. Pi notes.
