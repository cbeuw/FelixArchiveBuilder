We publish on Page 5 a letter from
Miss Fryd complaining of the "Reveille"
l i k e nature of recent issues of FELIX.
She does not put forward any constructive
ideas but intimates that the production
of a worthy FELIX could be achieved des-
pite the low standard of the Arts at I.C.
Constructive suggestions are naturally
welcomed more than the merely c r i t i c a l ,
but a l l indications of readers' Opinions
are greatly valued.
What do vou think of FELIX? T e l l us
what improvements you would like to see.
A l l non-inimical suggestions that involve
no law-breaking will be carefully con-
sidered.
U N I O N L I B R A R Y
In the last issue of FELIX, Mr. J .
K. Taylor enquired what had happened to
the Union Library, he having read i n
the "Rector's Bulletin" that i t had
been incorporated into a College General
Librarr
. The position i s that the for-
mation of the College General Library
i s subject to the approval by the Uni-
versity Grants Committee of a grant of
about £2,000 yearly to pay for a f u l l -
time librarian, books and upkeep.
The General Library Committee con-
sists of several members of staff with
three representatives of the Union Lib-
rary Committee t o ensure that the i n -
terest of the students are represented.
The Union w i l l make a grant of about
£250 yearly towards the purchase of
books, which w i l l be chosen by the
Union Library Committee only.
The principal advantages of this
scheme are that a full-time library w i l l
be available, and i t w i l l be on the i s -
land site. However, i t w i l l be seven
or eight years before i t can be housed
on the site, and at the moment, with
books being added at the rate of 600 a
year, the seeommodstioa i s quite i n - .
.
suffAnient. It i s hoped that Ho. IS,
Prince's Gardens may be taken over,
but this too i s subject to U.G.C. ap-
proval. I f this i s forthcoming, the
deoorating and installation of shelving
should be completed by next session.
The Union Library has recently
been open only from 1 to 2 p,nu and
has been i n somewhat ohaotie state.
This was due to theC departure early
this term of Miss Bamfard, the assis-
tant to Mr. James of the C. and G.
Library. However, a new assistant has
now been appointed and, starting this
month, the Library w i l l again be open
in the afternoons.
When the fresher comes to this col-
lege, anxious to make the best' of the
wonderful college l i f e he has heard so
much about, he i s immediately subjected
to a barrage of propaganda from FELIX
and from students conditioned to FELIX'S
views. I am referring of course to the
propaganda against the "vice* of brown-
bagging. What FELIX and others do not
appear to realize i s that brownhagging
does not necessarily mean a narrow edu-
cation, and even i f i t does i t i s i n
some oases justified.
Last year about a third of the
students at I.C. lived, for better or
for worse, at home. Why should these
students make the Union the centre of
their social l i f e ? Are they to stop
associating with their old friends just
because they have gone to college?
There i s l i t t l e to be gained i n persuing
activities at college which can more
conveniently be pursued at home.
Secondly many students, especially
post graduates ( who again make up about
a third of the I.C. student population),
have led a f u l l l i f e at college but have
now had enough of the hectic uncertainty
and anxious competition which i s inherent
in student l i f e , A l l students realize
sooner or later that college isn't every-
THE FUNCTION OF THE PHOENIX
Dear S i r ,
Criticism of the last issue of
Phoenix has been flying fast and furious
over the past fen weeks. A great deal
of this has been •useful and interesting.
However i t i s getting to a stage where
the points used in arguments on both
sides are becoming banal and on the
verge of bad taste. The more construc-
tive criticisms have given helpful
guidance in the compiling of the next
issue which i s already well towards the
proof reading stage. Being the only per-
son left to maintain the continuity of
the magazine, when I was seriously indis-
posed i t was difficult indeed, to even
attempt to find anybody who could pro-
duce from scratch the autumn issue.
That Peter Jarman and his colleagues
produced an issue at a l l i s commendable.
That they produced an issue with many
good articles i s highly commendable. I t
was badly balanced; there was l i t t l e
with direct bearing on I.C, It must be
remembered,though, that Imperial College
i s not a l l that interesting; students
here, whatever their intrinsic capabili-
ties, do not easily come by the art of
conscious self expression; events here
tend to centre round the t r i t e r things
in l i f e . This i s not cultural snobbery;
this i s rather an obvious state of
affairs.
Another point i s this. The sym-
bolism of the scientist and engineer
differs from that of an artist or writer.
This tends to create an a r t i f i c i a l bar-
r i e r between the two modes of expression.
There i s the cultural snobbery of art and
literature; there i s the cultural snob-
bery of technology. Surely the function
of a magazine such aa Phoenix i s to at-
tempt i n i t s own way to break down the
barrier. Thus the arts must, as far as
this i s possible without distortion, be
interpreted in terms the scientist can
easily grasp. It i s a difficult task
but worthy of the effort.
Tours sincerely,
Anthony Hodgson.
thing, and none more so than married stu-
dents, of whom there must be two or
three hundred at I.C.
Can brownbagging be justified i f i t
is due to concentration on work to the
exclusion of almost a l l else? Consider
the third year student who has made the
best of what college can offer, but then
finds that he i s heading for an "upper
second." I am sure that FELIX i s not
going to try to stop him working a l l
hours i f i t w i l l bring him a " f i r s t " and
with i t exemption from national service.
It i s worthwhile devoting one year a l -
most entirely to academic studies to
save those two relatively wasted years
in the army.
However i f anyone reading this view-
point has already fitted himself into
one of these categories I hope he i s not
making i t an excuse. I do not believe
that there i s anyone in this college who
cannotreasonably take part in some stu-
dent activity. Only a fool does not
make use of the opportunities, that c o l -
lege can offer. If those who are brown-
baggers only through sheer lack of i n -
itiative would take more interest i n the
Union, then the burden of I.C.'s non-
aoademio reputation would not f a l l so
heavily on those to whom College i s
their whole l i f e - a state of affairs
aa much to be deplored as brownbagging.

FAIR HEARING
Dear Sir,
As a member of the Musical Society
I am somewhat perturbed by the a t t i -
tude of a large section towards the
I.C. Choir.
The attitude of a friend of mine i
is typical. On being »3ked i f he w«s
coming to our performance of Bach's,
Mass in B minor on March 12th, he
replied "What, come and hear you l o t ,
not likelyJ" or words to that effect.
He nevertheless maintains that he
is a music lover, and attempts to
justify his attitude by saying that
he thinks we are b awful. YET HE
HAS NEViR HEARD US SINGS Surely for
a (presumably) educated person this
is a remarkable piece of judgment!
This state of mind i s , I fear, a l l
too common among fellow students. They
base their Opinion of the I.C. choir
on that of their (presumably) mediocre
School Choir.
' We are NOT mediocre. Wa are NOT
a school choir and we ARE worth hearing.
We are performing on March 12th a
great work, perhaps the greatest
choral work of a l l , for which many of
us have been rehearsing for over 12
months. A l l we ask i s that you give
us one fair hearing, this once, and
we feel some of you w i l l not go away
disappointed.
Yours faithfully,
Bryan J. Tilley.
