G i l Streets, alias Fred Nerk, alias
Herr Obermeistor Fuhrer, alias "short
and curly", i s a third year metallurgist
standing 5ft 6 inches i n his Terylene
sooks. (His height i n hare feet i s un-
known: he admits to having never re-
moved his sooks).
He was born i n the Lincolnshire ham-
let of Toynton a l l Saints (believe i t
or not) some years ago, (Lincolnshire
County Police are rather vague about
his correct age) on a Saturday morning
at 8.30. In Gil's own words: "I knew
i t was a Saturday because I had a half-
day off."
He was educated i n his father's
garage, on rare occasions attending
King Edward VI school at Spilsby ,
(where he was a corporal i n the Lincoln-
shire Wing A.T.C.). At the age of seven-
teen a v e i l of mystery (the Official
Secrets Act) was lowered on his career,
when he became an apprentice metallurgist
at Harwell.
Few facts about the three years he
spent there have come to public know-
ledge. It i s known that he played i n
the f i r s t team and the mixed eleven at
hookey, and that he was evicted from
his digs for turning his room into a
garage. (Gil says he l e f t because he
objected to the landlord, a Welshman,
calling him a bloody foreigner.) His
passion for lying on his back in a
pool of grease gave use to his f i r s t
oar (an H.M. Govt. Special with Singer
Le Mans engine.) The phenomenal per-
formance of this machine was obtained
by reducing i t s weight; mudguards,
lights, body panels, silencer and seats
were removed; eventually G i l was re-
moved too, (to the polioe station)
charged with 20 offences, and l e t off
with a caution.
Since coming to I.C. i n 1955, Gil's
enthusiasm for oars, and for those nec-
essities of l i f e which seem to be as-
sociated with cars, has not waned. He

now Osna half a Morris Eight (Dixie

in Tottenham.
Last year G i l was the R.S.M. Enter-
tainments Officer, and also dinner
"oharlie-in-ohief and o f f i c i a l re-
builder of Clementine. During his f i r s t
two years he was on the I.C. Entertain-
ments Cocmittee and i s now the Chairman.
According to John Hobson (of Guilds
Entertainments fame) the Saturday night
hops here are so enjoyable as to be
known as "Gil's Treats."
This flurry of activity has,
however, left some time for G i l to
pursue his main interests which i n -
clude making omelettes, running a
marriage bureau i n conjunction with
the social secretaries of several
women's colleges, (frustrated I.C.
males take note!) gooseberry pie, and
humanity i n general.. He says the only
thing he really dislikes are kippers
for breakfast and t a l l women who wear
high-heeled shoes. His ambitions are
to enter the Monte Carlo Rally, to
build his own house which he has a l -
ready designed, to marry at 30 and to
travel around the world.
His immediate ambition i s to re-
cover his old bowler hat which was:-
Bought for two shillings,
Swum across the Thames,
Covered with flour on Morphy Day,
Shattered by fireworks on November
5th,
and which has:-
Hobnobbed with Royalty*
and Been pinched by a member of R.C.S.
Gil has been forced to use his best
Sunday bowler as a temporary lampshade,
so would the present owner of the old
one please return i t as soon as possible.

The annual Dinner and Dance of
C. and G. College achieved success on
a scale comparable to that of last
term's Carnival. The Dinner was held
in the Upper Dining Hall and the Upper
Refectory, speeches being relayed to
the latter. Mr. Mooney surpassed him-
self by providing no fewer than 2A9
dinners. The excellence of the speeches
highlighted a memorable evening i n an
atmosphere considerably less formal than
the dress.
After the Royal toast, Professor
Christopherson, newly elected an hon-
orary member of the Union, proposed
the health of the College. There .fas
nothing much, he remarked, that he oould
say, i n public, of the President, and
quiokly passed on to the more seficus
matter of I.C.'s expansion, in which
C. &L G. would play an ever-increasing
part, as the need for technologists
became more acute. Mr. Dave Stevens
replied to the toast and produced the
sur-rise of the evening - The Spanner -
recently reclaimed from R.C.S.
A very lively speech followed
from Mr. John Hobson, who embarras-
sed his guests with some very well
chosen words. Mr. Chadwick was put
in his place by an after-party tale.
After enquiring i f Mr. Butters had his
trousers on, Mr. Hobson: "Travelled
through the sublime to .... Mr. G i l
Streets."
HOP SURVEY
... oontinusd from page 1.
There seemed to be no preference
for either blonde or brunette, provi-
ding she i s of a "reasonable sise and
shape" and possesses personality, with
accent on the latter. One man looks
for big eyes but rarely finds themj
another looks mainly for nice legs and
anklesj this, he said, i s no reflection
on intelligence "but i s very rewarding."
The opinion of the level of i n t e l -
ligence varied; some thought the females
were dim-witted, some over intelligent,
some were of "intelligence comparable
with that of I.C. men, which i s not say-
ing much."
There seemed to be a distinct lack of
dress sense among the girls. Many *a
budding flower i s obscured by rampant
foliage. Men found that they had to
compromise between what they want and
what they get, although most men came
to the hop just for an evening's enter-
tainment, not with any preconceived
notion of picking up a g i r l .
Every man questioned intended to
buy his partner refreshments. Most girls
allowed themselves to be led down for a
drink during the interval when they were
very considerate i n the ohoi.ce of drinks,
preferring fruit joices to spirits, but
were more reticent when invited for oof-
fee.
What about the after-care? Most of
the men interviewed had only one g i r l
friend usually at home or none at a l l ;
some had a half or three quarters (?)
of a girl friend but would elaborate no
further. Theoretically as many g i r l
friends as possible were desirable, but
"one takes up most of the time and mon-
ey." Another interviewee had mainly
nurses as g i r l friends; his appearance
corroborated his statement that "Nurses
are the downfall of students."
Such i s the opinion of I.C. men
of women and allied subjects, repres-
enting the general social trend. But,
of oourse, I.C. hops are only a begin-
ning. What i s to follow? Doubtless
you imagination w i l l satisfy your
curiosity!
In reply, a past C. & G. President
Mr. Foster delivered a most cynical
speech aimed at the present generation
of students, and after some penetrating
derogatory remarks about R.C.S., said
that he*, .could not wish to represent
a finer body of women."
The dancing then commenced and con-
tinued except for a short interval un-
t i l 2.30 a.m., after which records were
played to the few energetic bodies re-
maining. Throughout the interval a
be-bagpiped Scotsman had the crowd reel'
ing to eightsome's and dashing white
sergeants.
Auld Lang Syne and a Boomlaka comp-
leted the evenings o f f i c i a l entertain-
ment.
