TOUCHSTONE-
IS M A N M E A S U R A B L E ?
The topic f o r discussion at last
week's Touchstone, weekend had the rather
unpromising t i t l e , "Is Man Measurable?"
In fact, although we didn't realise i t ,
we were i n for a remarkably interesting
talk from the v i s i t i n g speaker - Mr. R.
J.B.Silvey, Head of the B.B.C.'s Audience
Research.
Mr.Silvey's talk dealt with "Social
Research", i n which he had been involved
for thirty years. He started by saying
that social scientists were more like
ordinary people than like "unwashed art-
i s t s and tireless poets", and after obs-
erving that the scientist, unlike the lay-
man, draws his conclusions only after
finding out the facts, said the only
question he could think of to which there
was a clear-out "Yes" or "No" answer was
"Is she pregnant?". This uncertainty
complicated social research, which must
aim to reduce the qualitative to quan-
titative terms as far as possible but
not to reduce human values to cold stat-
i s t i c s .
The process used i s that of
sampling: a small "sample" of people
i s asked a number of questions, chosen
with considerable care and usually ac-
companied by "decoy" questions designed
to keep the victims off their guard.
The victims must be representative of

Ten members of the Society, after
an uneventful journey by District line
reported to the M.P.D. soon after 2.15
on Wednesday, February 5Â« While a
guide was being found a gentleman who
said he was deputising for the shed
master took charge of the party and
invited us to inspect at close quar-
ters one of the 1000 h.p. diesel
locomotives now being put into ser-
vice on freight trains on the North
London line. While we were so doing
the man we'd 3een f i r s t returned with
our guide, who appeared to be several
years our junior, and was obviously
not interested but welcomed a chance to
stop work, and announced that climbing
on the locomotives was forbidden. Our
friend told us "I've given you permis-
sion" and took charge of the party. He
showed us round the shed, which i s
being converted to deal exclusively with
diesel locomotives, while our o f f i c i a l
guide trailed behind. Then we were l e t
loose i n the shed yard and those who'd
been put off from bringing their cameras
by a l i t t l e rain wondered i f they hadn't
been too pessimistic.
On arriving at Bow Works we waited
20 minutes for a guide,passing the time
in searching the walls and floor for
r e l i c s of pro-grouping railways. Apart
from the Gatekeeper himself a l l we
found was an L

belonged originally to the North Lon-

been built there since 1910. I t i s
now used for light and heavy repairs
and can accommodate up to 16 engines
at a time.
On Sunday March 9th the Society
i s having an all-day v i s i t by diesel

the whole group being studied (e.g.
a l l radio listeners) - i n listener
research, where questions on one day's
listening have to be answered the f o l -
lowing day; a questioner might by the.
evening be looking for a rich old man,
when a l l he oould find was a poor young
woman, who of course just would not do.
(However, as Mr. Silvey pointed out,the
two are often found together).
The speaker went on to talk about
measurement of attitudes, and revealed
that Anti-Semitism, abhorrence of sex-
education and support for corporal pun-
ishment usually go together. He then
gave reasons for the steady growth of
social research and examples of how i t
had been used i n the past.
Mr. Silvey finished with his own
job - broadcast audience research -
saying that i t was very d i f f i c u l t to
measure either the enjoyment of broad-
casts or people's comprehension of them.
The B.B.C. invites selected members of
the public to Broadcasting House, plies
them with coffee and biscuits ("You can
get them so docile they'll do anything!)
then plays a recorded talV to them, stop-
ping every few minutes to ask questions
on the subject matter. The answers rev-
eal how well the audience understood i t .
Questions followed, during which
Mr. Silvey mentioned that university
graduates tended to answer questions with
"What do you mean by ?". Then the
bar opened.
After dinner three groups were
formed and discussion continued until
about midnight on a number of questions
arising from the talk. After lunch on
Sunday the three groups reported the res
ults of the previous night's deliberations
One of the questions had involved sug-
gesting suitable social research to help
30lve some social problem. One group
chose "Teddy Boys, Students and Debutantes"
as their problem: we wonder what the con
nection i s ! Another, discussing capital
punishment, decided with great solemnity
that i t was impracticable to ask someone
i f they had been deterred by the threat
of hanging from committing murder!
Other points which emerged were
that freewill exists, that there i s a
case for vocational training for jour-
nalists, that there i s no cause for mak-
ing pre-election public opinion polls
i l l e g a l , and in addition such polls
might be useful before an important
piece of legislation; and that M.P.S
were a bad l o t anyway.
The proceedings were wound up by
Mr. Silvey, who agreed with, and amp-
l i f i e d , most of the conclusions.

On Tuesday, January 28th, the
Society had another f i r s t tasting "of
l i t t l e known wines, this time of
Madeira.
The tasting was preceded by a talk
by Mr. C03sart, who introduced Madeira
aa an island of mild and honey and
breath-taking romance.
The island has a volcanic soil,
enriched by the ashes of forests des-
troyed by f i r e oenturies ago, which
imparts an uiimistakable , burnt bitter
sweetness to the wine.
Madeira i s a heavy fortified wine
in the Port and Sherry class, whioh i t
faintly resembles i n taste, with perhaps
a hint of the nutmeg flavour of a
Vermouth. It i s more akin to a
Sherry, for i t s method of production
i s based on a "solera" system - a
system of blending, ensuing a conti-
nuity of style. There i s thus now
no vintage Madeira 3ince the .i sland
vines were destroyed by the dreaded
phylloxera plague i n the late seven-
ties. However, the pre-phylloxera
vintage i s s t i l l improving i n quality,
for unlike port, Madeira does not
suffer from the usual decay, as i t
rarely throws any sediment i n bottle.
Being insensitive to changes in
temperature, i t s chief markets are
i n India and Scandinavia. In England
i t has to compete with Port and Sherry
and comes a poor third.
The four main types of Madeira are
Bual, Verdeiho, Sercial and Malmsay,
named after the species of grape from
which they are made. The latter i s a
shade too sweet to suit the English
palate, to which the Bual or Verdeiho
i s more suited; the dark golden col-
our and pungent luscious bouquet of the
Verdeiho cannot f a i l to give pleasure.

Some readers may be surprised to
learn that there i s an I.C. Orchestra.
Like the Choir this i s more than l i b -
erally sprinkled with musicians from
other places.
On Thursday 30th January, our
Orchestra gave a short concert. The
f i r s t item, Bach's Brandenburg Concerto
No. 1, in F, required three oboe players;
there was only one. Undaunted, and with
one oboe, conductor Frank Kennard (music
master, Dulwich College) started ten
minutes late. A second oboe managed to
get through the fog i n time to arrive
for the start of the second movement.
(Loud applause) During the third move-
ment, the Orchestra began to find some
cohesion, which was more or less main-
tained for the re3t of the oonoert.
The second item, Konzertstucke f o r
Piano and Orchestra by Schumann, was
well performed. The soloist, Cordon
Stewart, R.C.M. was outstanding. The
I.C. upright was less so; i n fact one
member of the audience suggested that
i t be offered to Television's Movie
Magazine.
The third item was three Russian
Songs, sung in that language by Miss
