In the league game against Guy'a
Hospital at the U.L.U. pool on Tuea.
4.th Feb., I.C. 1st Team won 3 - 0 ,
even though two reserves had to be
found at the last minute. I.C. had
much more possession of the b a l l ,
but the shooting of the forwards was
lamentable.„ Scorers were Everest,
Corrigan and Bashem.
In a friendly match on the 6th.Feb.
two reserves had to play again, and
I.C. lost 11 - 5 to the very strong
Regent St. Poly. side. After rather
a shaky f i r s t half the team settled
down and the whole side played well
and with spirit. Scorers Larsen (4),
Corrigan ( l ) .
In the University leagues, the
1st Team are lying 3rd, the 2nd
Team are 5th and the 3rd Team are
2nd.

Anna Vincent, R.C.M. These were pleas-
ant, although the soloist was faced
with fierce competition from the afore
mentioned piano. The concert finished
with Ballet Music and Entr'acte II
from Rosamunds, by Sohubert.
It i s d i f f i c u l t to judge an amateur
orchestra f a i r l y but^ although i t i s not
as good an amateur group as i s our choir,
we may be proud of ours, and i t should
reach a very high standard i n the future.
The concert was followed by an i n -
formal musical party, when a wealth
of individual (and spontaneous) musical
talent was revealed. A v i o l i n solo by
Graham Silver (R.C.S., Chem. I) must be
mentioned. His classmates might well
view him as a rather more subtle suc-
cessor to Vic Oliver. The party con-
cluded with much washing up, at eleven
o'clock. I t was a thoroughly enjoyable
evening.

P I N C H E D
At 2.10 p.m. last Sunday, the
FELIX staff was gazing blankly out
of the window at Q.A. i n search of
inspiration. Suddenly there appeared
on the horizon a lorry load of men
disguised as policemen in order to
conduct the chaosat a rally organised
by the LAXLY WORKER. Shortly after
their arrival one of the gentlemen
was seen to enter the Union, reappear-
ing almost immediately with a Film Soc.
advertisement. This was manhandled into
the lorry and rapidly transformed into a
card table.
Five minutes later two members of
the FELIX staff, summoning up their
resolves, marched on the. offenders and
damanded the return of the stolen art-
icle, but they were greeted with ges-
ticulation and informed that the game
of strip poker by then i n progress could
on no account be interrupted. Undaunted,
our intrepid reporters suddenly found a
NO PARKING sign in their hands, but be-
fore they could tuck i t inside their jac-
kets menacing growls issuing from the
front end of the lorry (not the engine)
requested them to desist forthwith.
Back i n the FELIX room:
Some consultation ensued. Shall we
dial 999? Hmm. We don't want more of
them. A Lady Godiva stunt? Ah. Eyes
turned to the female reporter. She
blushed daintily. "Has anyone got two
ha'pennies? I ' l l ask i f they can direct
me ?" Taking with her three
oopies of the current FELIX, as an after-
thought, she made her way to the lorry.
The curtains parted and out popped a
l i t t l e round helmet. And another. And
another Talking. Whispering. And
then twenty constables heaved
their bosoms, dried their eyes and to
Miss W.ll.c. presented their beloved
card table. Triumphantly she returned.
I f only we were women what a joy-
ride Morphy Day would be.

"DAMN, I've got potatoes down
my Jumper" exclaimed a prom-
inent member of I.C.W.A. So
now we know'.
A CRAZE for bill-posting end
sign-writing seems to have (track
Kensington recently. As ever,
I.C. i s getting thoroughly plas-
tered.
DEFINITION of an I.C. hop: "What
are a l l those men doing standing
there?"
SO THE 3.B.C. find they "can get
them so docile they'll do any-
thing" on a oup of coffee and
biscuits. We wish we could.
" HAS ANYBODY HERE SEEN CHADDLES ?1
Four female visitors to I.C. were
"caught i n the act" of desecrating the
Boderie H i l l building with this white-
wash inscription on Tuesday morning
(1.30 a.m. F.T.). Two pyjama-clad
Guildsmen gave chase and, after being
thoroughly whitened, caught one of the
culprits. Clothes were removed and ex-
changed, providing the lucky gentlemen
with an exouse to return later that day
for supper.
The marauders, from the local C.S.M.-
etery, also left an amorphous-looking
parcel for the Secretary of the Union
to open publicly at the next Union meet-
ing. What will he find? We shall see.
