The Union Counoil meeting on Monday,
February 3rd. was considerably shorter
wan the previous one, ending at 7.30
T h < s
prooeedinga are summarised
oelow.
The broken step on the central
staircase leading to the 3rd floor of
the Union was due to the dropping on
i t of the old piano during transit to
a children's Christmas party elsewhere
in the College. Twelve other steps were
damaged. The broken one w i l l be re-
placed at College expense.
In a further attempt to prevent
overloading, the l i f t in the Union w i l l
shortly be fitted with a cunning gad-
get consisting of a siren that emits a
high-pitched whine when the capacity i s
exceeded.
On the extramural side, the cost of
participating in Touchstone weekends i s
to go up from ten to fifteen shillings,
and i t i s hoped that C.Day Lewis w i l l
give some General Studies lectures on
poetry.
The Entertainments Committee reports
poor organisation on the part of clubs
running hops: some supervision seems to
be needed. Some of the doormen hired
for hops have been found rather un-
satisfactory and i t i s hoped that 80I-
lege technicians may take their place.
The next Union meeting w i l l be held
on the 6th of March.

The seoond Mock Parliament was
held i n Ayrton Hall on Thursday,
January 30th. A Labour Government
was i n office, and the Liberal Society
provided the o f f i c i a l Opposition.
Business opened with a statement of
policy by the Prime Minister, whioh
was replied to by the leader of the
Opposition.
A B i l l to repeal the Conservative
Government's Rent Aot, and to introduce
some new measures on housing, provided
acne interesting debating. The
Opposition was somewhat divided, and
did not press for a division. The
B i l l was therefore accepted unopposed.
A debate on Education provoked
some violent debating on the subjects
of the eleven plus exam, and the future
of public schools, but general agree-
ment was f e l t on the subject of students
grants* The Government promised to
give this matter sympathetic considera-
tion. An Opposition motion of no confi-
dence in the Government was defeated.
The final business on the order
paper was a debate on nationalisation.
The Government proposed to nationalise
several industries, including the road
haulage and the coal distribution i n -
dustries. A proposal by an independent
M.P. to nationalise wine, women, and
song was vociferously opposed by the
two members of I.C.W.A. present.
The evening was enlivened by many
Interjections of a varied and interest-
ing nature. The Conservative Society
unfortunately did not support this
sitting of the Mock Parliament. The
House hoped that they would attend
the f i n a l two sittings.

The Social Clubs Committee held a
Meting on Thursday February 6th. The
main items of business were two proposed
amendments to the constitution, both of
which were approved. The f i r s t was that
any proposed new sooiety must gain the
support of one half of the members pre-
sent at a committee meeting while the
second allows two alternative possibili-
ties should the f u l l formation of a
Club or Sooiety be rejected:
(a) The Society or Club shall be
formed as a Minor Society of a suitable
existing Sooiety or Club. The Minor
Society shall be independent of the
Senior Club, both financially and with
regard to activities but shall be re-
presented on the S.C.C. by the Presi-
dent or Chairman of the Senior Club.
(b) The Society shall be formed as
in (a) but shall be financially depen-
dent on the Senior Club., and be named
a Sub-group.
The Committee whs 11, have the power
to recommend to Imperial College Union
Council that any club or sub-group be
disbanded i f i t considers that the i n -
terests of the Union demand i t .
The Photographic Society has been
awarded a Pot i n the Bar i n recognition
of their outstanding record - they are
very well known and have been asked to
participate in international exhibitions,
besides carrying off many f i r s t places
in U.L. exhibitions. Their own exhibi-
tions have been Judged by prominent mem-
bers of the photographic world, who
have complimented them on their work.
The Executive Committee of the S.C.C.
has also revised the subscription rates
of the Social, clubs, taking into account
their membership and expenditure. Sev-
eral changes were approved.

The request for ideas for dealing
with the Coloutt tower has brought to
light a wealth of originality; a selection
follows.
Dear S i r ,
I suggest that the Colcutt Tower
be exhibited in a "thief-proof"bracket
in the entrance hall of R.C.S.
Yours sincerely,
Anthony L. Brookes.
Dear Sir,
Why not keep the Coloutt Tower
in order that our President can
have a l i t t l e room right at the
top i n which to practice on his
euphonium.
Yours faithfully,
Judy Lemon.
Dear Sir,
The present outcry against the
Colcutt Tower amazes me. Has noâ€”one
realized what a tremendous asset we
have i n our midst?
The entire s k i l l o f a l l three
constituent Colleges must immediately
be harnessed to the project of giving
the Tower a permanent t i l t . This
would attract visitors from a l l over
the world and immeasurably increase
the prestige and revenue of the College.
After a l l , who would have heard of
Pisa i f i t s tower were straight?
But there would be a nobler scienti-
fic motive behind a l l this. It i s
quite possible that i n the not-too-dis-
tant future materials w i l l be treated
in such a way that they w i l l resist
the force of gravity and be repelled
by the earth. Research on these mater-
ials would inevitably include a study
of the time they would take to rise
vertically to a given height on being
released at ground level. What better
equipment could one want for this
experiment than the Leaning Tower of
Kensington?
Yours tiltedly,
I.N. Guy.
Dear Sir,
It i s generally acknowledged that
the Colcutt Tower must have additional
supports when the surrounding buildings
are removed. One obvious way of doing
this i s to build four flying buttresses
at the corners of the tower to stabilize
i t . If the Reader will refer to the
diagram he w i l l see that i f the buttresses
were carefully designed they would give
the tower the appearance of a gigantic
neolithic rocket.
Nothing could be a more worthy
symbol of the scientific work on the
island site. Further, i t would evoke
great astonishment and admiration from
overseas tourists who never realized
that our entry into the f i e l d of bal-
l i s t i c missiles had preceded the f i r s t
automobile by half a century.
Poignancy i s added to the situation
by the theory that the tower w i l l
gradually sink into the ground under
its vast weight when the supporting
buildings are removed. As though
winding up for a huge leap into space
the tower (Colputnik I?) would disappear
slowly from sight, with Mr. John
Betjeman doing a smart salute on one of
the balconies as i t went down.
Yours faithfully,
Norman B. Greaves.
