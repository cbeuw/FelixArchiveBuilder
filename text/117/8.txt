3 - 1 VICTORY OVER HEADING UNIVERSITY
In the annual four-orew fixture
against Reading, the 1st, 3rd. and
4th, VIII's won their races comfort-
ably, and the 2nd. VIII lost by a
narrow margin after an intriguing race
in which the crews kept stopping to
wait for each other.
The races took place at Putney,
being rowed on the rising tide. The
order of racing was 3rd., 2nd., 4th.,
1st. VIII's. The f i r s t two races were
rowed in pouring rain, and the last two
in water which was rapidly becoming
rougher as the tide rose.
The 3rd. VIII started well on Surrey
Stn. and were J length up on reaching
the Boathouse; going comfortably, they
finished the 1-mile course in 4m. 46s.
with a lead of 4 lengths. The End.VIII
took the Mddx. Stn. ,^nd had built up
a lead of £ - f length at Fulhara Foot-
ball Ground where, no. 6 in the I .C.
crew caught an enormous crab. By the
time he had recovered, the crew wa3
about 5 lengths down. The Reading
crew easied and waited for the I.C.
crew to recover, restarting about 2£
lengths ahead of them. Despite a fin-
ishing burst of great ferocity, I.C.
lost by the narrow margin of J length
in a time of 8m, 5s. for the Putney
Bridge to Hammersmith Bridge course.
The 4th. VIII were determined to re-
trieve the situation, and rowed a very
workmanlike race on the Surrey station
to win by 4 lengths in 4m. 47s. for the
1-mile course - an excellent time for
a clinker boat.
Ifcanwhile the water had been getting
steadily rougher, and by the time the
l s t . VIII boated conditions were most
unpleasant. Both crews got off to a
good start, but the I.C. VIII had a
lead of a canvas at the Boathouae.
They improved steadily on this and went
on to win by 3j lengths in a time of
7m. 40s. for the Bridge to Bridge
course.
On the previous Sunday the four main
"fresher" crews rowed up to Riohmond
for lunch, then paddled together back
to Chiswick Bridge, from where they
raced back to Putney. It was extremely
encouraging to see the determination
shown by these crews, only one of
which had had previous rowing exper-
ience. Of necessity, rowing involves
mainly weeks of training in preparation
for a few minutes racing; this often
tends to discourage newcomers to the
sport. But to those who persevere and
achieve even a small degree ot success
comes the satisfying reward of over-
coming the elements, which usually
seem to conspire against one.

team, which, although suffering from
lack of practice, fought well to beat
the Battersea team which has already
beaten a number of the larger London
Colleges this term. Published

After the defeat by Southampton
University the lst. XI certainly need-
ed to regain confidence in i t s ability.
Although St.Hferk and St.John College
are not among our strongest opponents,
for the f i r s t half they controlled the
course of the game. Gradually the
I.C. team overcame i t s lethargy and
became more purposeful. Strong tack-
ling by the defence and good combinat-
ion among the attack converted a 0-1
halftime deficit into a 4 - 1 victory.
The next match, versus New College
Oxford, became a mere formality, as
I.C. won easily by 7 goals to 2.
Keith Codling and Harry Pidgeon ob-
tained hat-tricks, which may prove
expensive for them at the annual
dinner.

The official training period this
term is at Hurlingham Park Athletic
Ground on Sunday mornings at 11,00 am.
Circuit training can s t i l l be carried
out in the Snack Bar each afternoon
after College hours.
Such an easy victory was not a good
preparation for the following League
match against Westminster College.
In the f i r s t half, I.C. had more of
the play, but Westminster took ad-
vantage of two slips in the Harlington
mud, and at halftime were leading
2 - 0 . Although I.C. tried hard, even
perhaps a l i t t l e too hard, to even
the score, our efforts met with no
success. Late in the game Westminster
scored one furthur goal, to make
victory absolutely certain. Our hopes
of League honours are now considerably
dimmed.
However, the 3rd. XI, captained by
George Webster, now need only two
points from their remaining games to
win the division two championship.
Their promotion would mean that the
I.C. 2nd. and 3rd, teams would compete
in the same division next sesson,
which would solve current speculation
as to their relative merits.
The 4th. XI are in a precarious
position. After winning 12 League
games in a row, mostly by big margins,
I.C. have lost twice to Institute of
Education, their chief rivals, and
promotion is now doubtful. Having
already scored over a hundred goals
this season, the 4th, team deserve
stronger fixtures for next season.

The f i r s t team has met stiff oppos-
ition in the past fortnight and has
not been very successful. On l s t .
Feb. the Club lost to Bristol A.C.
and Bristol University, at Bristol.
J.Collins did well to finish 3rd. in
a field of 40, and J.Conway waa 9th.
after dropping a few places during
the last half mile of a very tough
six-mile course. The evening cele-
brations were more successful, and
after the last train had departed
three I.C. men, having abundant faith
in the generosity of British motorists,
started at 1.00 am. to hitch-hike to
London, But l i f t s were scarce, and
after walking about 20 miles, and
waking the inhabitants of several
West Country villages with their sing-
ing, they caught a train to London on
the Sunday morning.
The 2nd. team have at last succeeded
in defeating Brentwood School, but
only by one point, and thanks to a l s t .
team member who missed the train to
Bristol.
On 8th. Feb. a match with U.C. devel-
oped into a huge race with 10 strong
teams competing, including Cxford II,
Southampton and Bristol. With heavy
•rain and thick mud the Parliament Hill
course was at its worst. I.C. came
4th. losing to Oxford, Southampton and
L.S.E., but defeating our great rivals
U.C. and Bristol.
The second team had a match against
Pearl Assurance and Lloyds Bank, over
a rather wet and muddy course at
Maiden. Lloyds won the race fairly
easily, with I.C. second; our first
man was "
• .Wall, in 3rd. place.
