This week the third of the model
study-bedrooms ereoted i n No. 14 Prince's
Gardens by Richard Sheppard and Partners
was finished. The room embodies several
interesting ideas, but comparison with
the previous two reveals some economies
that may not find favour with students.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
Workmen were s t i l l i n the room
when i t was inspected by FELIX re-
porters and the only piece of fur-
niture i n evidence was the bed, eq-
uipped with a polythene-wrapped mat-
tress.
The room measures approximately
14* 6" hy 8' 6". A sliding window
occupies one end, with an imitation
marble slab over a heater forming a
window seat, as i n the original models
(see photograph). At the other end
are the (hollow) door and wash-basin.
The latter i s set away from the wall
to make for eay cleaning, the only
vertical support being the waste pipe,
whioh i s chromium plated. The taps
are not sprung but are similar to
those in the Union.
Above the basin and the door, run-
ning the whole length of the wall, i s
a fairly deep cupboard, useful for stor-
ing suitcases etc. A bare pearl light
bulb protrudes from i t s underside to
provide a shaving light.
NO STRETCHING
The room has only one power point,
situated 6* above floor level about
half-way along the side wall. The
lighting switch i s three feet above
this and thus limits the placing of
furniture. The idea i s that i f one's
bed i s nearby no stretching i s re-
quired to reach i t . The light itself
i s suspended from the ceiling by sev-
eral feet of flex (looped up on i t s e l f ) .
The intention i s that i t can be pul-
led over to any part of the room by
strategically placed pieces of string.
No table lamp i s envisaged.
The furniture to be used in the
hostel has not been finally decided
upon. Divan beds with low headboards
and interior sprung mattresses w i l l
be used; wardrobes on castors may be.
Alternative forms of bookshelving are
on view - a box arrangement that stands
on the floor and a narrow Dexion-like
rack running from picture-rail to
floor to which four rather shoddily
finished shelves are affixed at des-
ired heights, unfortunately both of
these occupy some floor space and
students may prefer the better f i n -
ished article shown in the photograph,
whioh allows a desk to be placed be-
neath.
SUGGESTIONS
tt i s to be hoped that these rooms
w i l l be opened for a few days to mem-
bers of the Union, so that the pre-
decessors of those who w i l l use them
can pass criticism and make suggestions.

TO MELT I.C. HEARTS
The 3econd phase of the FELIX hop
survey went into operation last Satur-
day. This time the women were under
fire. What did the men want? Did
they get i t ? That i s what we wanted
to know. Some of the men were indeed
tongue-tied(see last.issue), answering
in monosyllables. Luckily others were
more vociferous; below are given some
general opinions:
Generally the women were quite
satisfactory, although "warmth and home-
liness" were lacking in most. Also
they needed to be more mature mentally,
inferring that their physical maturity
was adequate. As one man put i t , they
were "often overexposed physically and
underdeveloped mentally" However,
some of the men preferred them that way'
Little maternal instinct was evident in.
the majority of the females. Requests
to "come back to the digs to wash up
and make me some coffee " were severely
rebuffed by such excuses as "
M
u
m
m
y would
not like i t " , but, as we a l l know, Mum-
my would not get i t l
However, before a man asks a g i r l
to his flat for coffee he has to find
her. Although most men seek them at
hops a few women appear in odd places
â€¢On top of a bonfire", "In Lapland",
or even "In bed." These rarities do
not detract from the problem of con-
versation at hops. Girls who answer
"Tes" to "Do you come hear often" are
to be avoided as there i s obviously
something wrong.
Some men had original trends in
conversation. "Does Stravinsky bore
you?" Or "Are you pro-Osborne?" "Do
you like champagne and oysters?" or
"If I t e l l you that you have a good
figure, w i l l you hold i t against meT"
"Have you ever been to China? T e l l ,
what a coincidence, neither have I."
However, l i t t l e suooess i s reported
with the above opentags. One inter-
viewee has had limited success with
a pasMrio qynlnnl approach. It was
generally f e l t that the girls should
make more attempts at conversation.
