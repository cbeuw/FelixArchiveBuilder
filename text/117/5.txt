INDIFFERENCE? L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R
Dear S i r ,
The FELIX editorial on the signi-
ficance of ZETA came as a surprise.
For a change, FELIX was concerned with
the oldest problem i n the world, vis.
preservation and improvement of humani-
ty, i n addition to the seoond oldest
problem, v i z . Sex. A step i n evolutionl
I thought. After a l l , preservation
must precede propagation. Who wouldn't
prefer to have Marilyn Monroe i n one
delightful SA - active piece rather than
have her disintegrated into <
*
. - emitting
atoms. But calories must be consumed t-
before statistics (the v i t a l onesJ) are
developed. It i s the fact that calories
are just not being imbibed over vast
areas of Asia and Africa that has been
pinpointed by the FELIX editorial i n
stressing the significance of Zeta. It
appears that there i s starvation at a
stage i n human history when science can
provide plenty. Why?
We i n Asia are seeking the answer
to this question. And when we come to
advanced countries like this, and to
premier scientific inotitutions such
as I.C., we hope to learn from the
men i n these institutions not only
about telemetering and thermodynamics,
but also about the marriage between
science and human welfare, whioh has
apparently been banned.
How much do we learn from the
average I.C. students? Very l i t t l e .
Few can teach us what conditions are
required for science to be harnessed
to human welfare. To be civilized i s
to be concerned with civilization;
from this standpoint few are c i v i l i -
sed. We "ignorant" natives find
an appalling ignorance about the
affairs of large segments of huma-
nity. We find "free" minds so
brainwashed that they believe they
shoudn't be concerned with the use
of science. These makers of to-
morrow's world (of course you are,
otherwise money wouldn't be spent
on I.C.) have been indoctrinated i n -
to steering clear of the problem
of how tomorrow's world should be.
While Jews were being gassed
and their bodies burnt as fuel, Nazi
scientists were "disinterestedly"
studying the efficiency of the con-
version into power. Is the a t t i -
tude commonly held by I.C. students
very different?
I doubt i t l Which i s why we
Asian and African students are
impressed by the editorial in FELIX.
In i t i s the unassuming answer to
Jarman's request far constructive
criticism. Camus was committed an
Algeria, and i t appears that this
editorial was inspired much more
by the spirit of Camus than was
the "valiant band of writers" in
the Phoenix.
Yours sincerely,
A.K.IJ. Ready.
OUTSIDE VIEW
Dear Sir,
As a sporadic reader of FELIX and
an occasional visitor to I.C. I was
most interested to read Viewpoint i n
the current issue.
My own past includes several years
at one of the older provincial Universi-
ties of Mr. Bridgwater's article. I
was fortunate i n always living close
to the major buildings of the University
and, more particularly, that of the
Union. Consequently I was able to
take part i n any activity I chose,
without making a major effort i n the
way of travelling etc., and found out
something of the other fellows' point
of view.
Not a l l of my year were i n the same
position. Those coning from neigh-
bouring towns constituted the largest
part of our 9 to 5 population. It may
be coincidence but when I now meet
members of this group conversation is
mainly United to sex, shop and ale.
Aa I see i t the students at I.C.
suffer i n their University education
because I.C. i s both non-residential
and also a technical College with the
•xamining status of a University.
The answers to the present pre-
dominanoe of "specialist" University
educations are, I think:-
(a) Completely residential Uni-
versities.
(b) The abolition of the system
of advanced technical collages
(I.C. included).
(o) The removal of the interference
of Grant Authorities i n Universi-
ty affairs i n the way of lecture
attendance reports etc., whioh
compel many students to become
•ewiers of the 9 to 5 class,
and (d) The removal of teachers from
University posts and their
replacement by lecturers.
Item (o) i s of course the result of local
bodies misguidedly seeing that the rates
and tax payere money i s well spent.
Not a l l students will agree with
(d). However i f you want to be taught,
as opposed to learning by the University
system, then one should attend a techni-
cal college and leave your place i n the
University Open for someone who wants
to learn.
If our"narrow minded friends i n
their rut of self-sufficiency"lose
from the introduction of the Arts into
the College Hostel, or better into the
College itself, the loss will only be
temporary. The losers should realise
that advances in any one field genera-
l l y come by the application of ideas
and techniques gained from other fields.
The sooner one realises that one's own
field i s not the only worth while one
the better.
Yours eto.,

SEX AND BEER
Dear Sir,
In his Viewpoint i n the last issue
of FELIX, Mr. Bridgwater dismisses with
scorn "sex and beer" aa opportunities
of broadening our interests, but I
think that they are two of the most
important channels open for possible
promotion of our intellects.
Is i t not a fast that we meet
more outsiders with diverse opinions
at hops than on most other occasions
in college life? Can we not express
ourselves more freely with a Jug of
alcohol i n our hands than without?
There i s more to be gained from these
pursuits than from inviting outsiders
to join our social clubs and societies.
Yours eto.,
GLOBETROTTER
Dear S i r ,
Last October, i n FELIX 111, you
presented the first of a series of
articles called the "FELIX GLOBE-
TROTTES GUIDE". This was both i n -
formative and useful, and I eagerly
awaited more. FELIX 112 informed us
that your correspondent "had not
found his way back to I.C." from
Westfield." After that: silence.
This, sir, shows FELIX i n a very
poor light. Is FELIX a stick-in-mud
or has curiosity killed the cat? As
i t will shortly be spring, when a
young man's fancy turns to love eto.,
now i s an excellent time to continue
this series.
Maybe I.C. men are "tongue-tied,
leaden-footed" (FELIX 116) through
worry about how to get home after
escorting the g i r l friend to her
home. The novelty of walking back
from Hampstead through the centre
of London i n the small hours of
Sunday morning soon wears off, as
most freshers by now will have
found out.
This, sir, i t i s in your hands to
remedy.
Yours faithfully,
Dave Briggs.
Editor's note:-
Unfortunately for the series our
Globetrotter went too far.

XWORD
Dear Sir,
I suppose the opinion, recently
voiced in fairly prominent quarters,
that scientists etc. are uneducated
is taken by most members of I.C. with
the proverbial pinch of NaCl. It i s
therefore doubly distressing when the
truth of i t i s demonstrated, as
happened yesterday in the Dining Hall
at lunch. Sitting opposite me were
two postgraduates (of which College
is irrelevant), doing a crossword
over their meal(X ); they argued for
nearly ten minutes over whether "Con-
secutive" was spelt "Consecative"
of "Conseccative". They were followed
at the table by two gentlemen in
scarves and macintoshes.
It i s ea;y to feel superior about
this sort of thing, Sir, but surely
i t helps to demonstrate the need for
intimate contact, in Imperial College,
with something more than just "Science
and Technology", i.e. with Education.
Yours faithfully,
J. Wendon.
THE MOTE
Dear S i r ,
May I suggest that FELIX f i r s t
cast out the beam in his own eye, and
then proceed to oa t out the mote whioh
is in his brother's eye.
I have recently heard FELIX referred
to as a college "Reveille", by a student
here, and suggest that circulation might
be larger i f FELIX more closely resembled
the college newspaper i t i s meant to be.
Any students preferring "Reveille" may
always Obtain that mace.sine at any news-
agent.
The standard of the Arts may net
be high at Imperial College, put surely
we can produce a newspaper worthy of
the greatest science college i n the
country.
