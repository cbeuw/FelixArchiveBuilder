No. Your degree doesn't
automatically entitle you
to become an Admiral
(or even a Sub-Lieutenant)
But it helps
A degree helps, because in the Royal Navy today, a
degree counts. A s a graduate you are eligible to
enter the Royal Navy as a Seaman, Engineer, Supply
and Secretariat or Instructor Officer.
M i n d you, there's more to it than being academic.
The work is demanding, is certainly different, and
calls for intelligence as well as education; for charac-
ter as well as a degree. A s an Engineer Officer, you
have the responsibility for the efficiency and success
of startlingly advanced equipment: the complex
electronic heart o f every fighting ship for example.
Or you could be working with nuclear reactors, gas
turbines, computers and so on. O n the other hand,
as a Seaman Officer you could have your own
command i n your late twenties.
Promotion prospects are excellent. Y o u have an
exciting, varied life, with world-wide travel, sport,
and enjoy a high professional status.
Above all you're involved i n what is perhaps the
most important job i n the world: front line preser-
vation o f peace.
University Cadetshlps are open to young men be-
tween 17* and 23; men either about to go to Univer-
sity or C . A . T . or those already doing a full time
course. Y o u could have your fees paid a n d draw
officer's pay a n d allowances.
Acquaintance visits. T o give y o u a taste o f what life is
like in the R o y a l N a v y y o u can atlend a 7-week
workshop course held at the Royal Naval Engineer-
ing College, Plymouth during the summer vacaiion,
or a one-week visit to a N a v a l port in ihe South.
