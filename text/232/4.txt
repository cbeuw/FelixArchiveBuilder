Williams in retrospective mood
But these have not been his only challengers,
of whom m y main criticism is. two-fold—we
have lacked confidence and we were never
united. Even now, eight months on, these
faults are still only too evident However,
the exodus of Fletcher is nigh.
In all fairness though. I should just point out
that h'e has given the Union a strength that
would otherwise have been lacking. F o r all
his faults he has perhaps been the best I C U
President in the past four years.
O f this year's "princes" Molam and Dean there
is little to say. Unlike Fletcher they have
been uncontroversial and mundane; they; have
also been active and conscientious.
For too long the Royal College o f Science Union
has at best vegetated, at worst gone to seed.
This year the fungus got in. Mike Scott i n -
flicted his presence even where it was not wel-
come but never was anyone left with the i m -
pression that he had anything constructive to
say. O n e can but hope that the advent of
previously-defeated Cavanagh will bring the
great wind of change R C S needs—wider and
better publicity, a simplified and clarified con-
stitution and a Union Office that is the centre
of a thriving organisation.
In contrast I have alwavs admired the Strength
of the City and Guilds College Union. D » i
Howell has experienced another really en-
couraging year, and publicity and the "ever-
open" Guilds Union Office in particular have
shown how necessary the combination of a
willing team and strong leader are to the con-
tinued success of what would normally be an
apathetic organisation.
The strength of the Royal School of Mines
Union, however, lies in its compactness.
Minesmen seem extraordinarily sensitive of
their small numbers wnd determined to over-
come thi* apparent disadvantage. This year's
success has perhaps been reflected more in
their sporting achievements than in the public
personality of Dick Gash- Many thanks to
Guilds anct Mines especially for their co-
operation in presenting us with news after the
demise of their regular columns.
E a ch year one club standi out from the rest.
In 1963/4, its formative year the H G Wells
Society was outstanding. T h e Folk Song
Club blossomed forth in 1964/5. M u c h praise
this year is due Jim Murray and the Enter-
tainment Committee with particular respect to
their Sunday evening "cool spots" i n the
Lower Lounge; these somehow reflect all that
is good about I C Union. Praise too to the
International Relations C l u b once more dealing
well with their original role. But. from an
unfortunately biassed point of view, 1 feel
that this has been F E L I X ' s year.
Its present success may be traced back to Andy
Pawlowicz in 1962/3, of whom it was later saiu
he "established something of a record i n that
he remained in office for the whole year and
broke even financially." Regrettably the latter
cannot be claimed for this year, but an invest-
ment of some £.200 into an organisation with
an annual turnover of £ 2 , 0 0 0 has been neces-
sary to make possible perhaps the most ex-
pansive year in its history next year.
The beginning of the year bode ill, threatening
a complete reversal of the previous three
years' expansion through stunted advertising
revenue and an expected losftv of £ 1 6 0 in the
first term. Only an active and united staff
could turn such a situation to advantage—the
innovations of a red heading which hits com-
fortably but forcibly and the "bigger look" by
using a smaller type on the same size of page,
two record-size editions new ideas in advert-
ising campaigns greater interest in the College
asi a whole rather than just the Union, and
increased circulation (toppirg 2,000 on the
Careers issue). .
M y most enjoyable time on F E L I X — t h e Spring
T e r m when we were tasting success i n so many
ways. M y greatest d i s a p p o i n t m e n t — S T U D E N T
C O L O U R , an exciting Idea which Was allow-
ed to go to sleep. However, released of m y
F E L I X responsibilities, I intend to kick thjt
organisation into activity again, though a
potential publication date must again be put)
off for six months.
In February 1964 it was said, " F E L I X is rapidly
becoming a newspaper with enthusiasm and
ideas snowballing. W e have, I think, arrived.
But now is not the time to sit back a n d rest
on our laurels. A newspaper is not static, and
F E L I X will cOTtmuejto change.
Having begun his T f a L I X career under a
Combes it is particularly fitting at this time
for Williams to bow out to another- I wish
Peter and next year's staff the best o f luck
and the enjoyment I have experienced in this
year of office.

Too many freshers in Hall
Sir,
In the applications for Hall places
this year, the number of re-aocept-
ances for Hall has been dropped
from 25% to 15%. With the shortage
of Hall places this is entirely reason-
able, but the pressure for places
from students is unlikely to be reliev-
ed to any extent, since most of these
places are to go to freshers. As an
exomple Beit Hall (men) Will have
15 reacceptanes this year, compared
with 23 last vear and 30 freshmen
compared with 24 last year. Fresh-
e n i n H a l l come into two main
categories : one who will benefit any-
way from College life and will he
in a position to contribute more to
Hall and College life in the second
or third year and the other who,
nominated by departments on es-
sentially school standards fails to
benefit from or contribute to Hall or
College life.
Thus, to me, this change of em-
phasis from re-acceptances to fresh-
ers seems a retrograde step, defeat-
ing the whole objects of widening
Hall entry to members of I.C.
I speak, although a member of
Beit Hall selection Sub-Committee,
in a private capacity and these
opinions i n no way represent the
views of the rest of the sub-Com-
mittee. M I K E E D W A R D S
