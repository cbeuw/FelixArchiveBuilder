T h e refectory a n d h a l l accounts

M r A Grierson,- R S M Senior

Ann Hay
to enliven
ICWA
A N N H A Y , a second-year Botanist,
scored a convincing victory over
Pam Pocock on T h u r s d a y to be elect-
ed President of I C Woman's A s -
sociation.
Initially, she intends to give
freshers a better introduction to the
C o l l e g e as a w h o l e , instead of just
I C W A . She also hopes for m o r e i n -
f o r m a l activities such as parties a n d
more talks.
A s an innovation she w o u l d like
to see arranged a n exchange w i t h
foreign w o m e n students. O n the
'political' scene she hopes that
I C W A w i l l play a more important
role i n the U n i o n perhaps by recoup-
i n g some of its lost representation
on various C o u n c i l subcommittees.
C o u n c i l . H o w e v e r , this w a s a matter
for: next year's committee to decide.
M i n e s w e n t further to say that it
w o u l d b e " v e r y difficult to justify i n -
creasing the allowace from I C " u n -
less the £ 7 5 supplementary grant
for returning hospitality to foreign
students was w i t h d r a w n .
Negative reserves
R C S U m e a n w h i l e has "negative
l i q u i d r e s e r v e s " — M i n e s , a n d G u i l d s
a i m at about £ 4 0 0 e a c h — a n d w i t
debts outstanding to the College r e -
fectories totalling £ 1 0 0 0 the stock
the U n i o n holds (also t o t a l l i n g
£ 1 0 0 0 ) is mortgaged.
E r p e n d i t u r e o n the general account
this year has not exceeded last
year's. £ 1 1 0 spent i n connection w i t h
the Bristol P e d a l C a r R a c e — i n
w h i c h R C S w o n its c l a s s — w a s de-
s c r i b e d by M r P a i n as " a waste of
p u b h c fudns due to carelessness".
B u t the s u m a h d to b e p a i d as it
h a d been a p p r o v e d by M i k e Scott,
R C S President.
M r Pain, in common with all
other Union Senior Treasurers,
has no executive status, the de-
cisions on spending being those
of the executives and, at a lower
level, the clubs and entertain-
ments committees.
T h e entertainments account nas
also needed a heavy subsidy, part-
icularly i n respect of the Freshers'
D i n n e r s a n d R C S C a r n i v a l — e s t i m a t -
es for the latter took account of only
half the ordered n u m b e r of meals.
A l l this has taken place this year
despite warnings f r o m the Senior
Treasurer at the last G e n e r a l C o m -
mittee joint meeting. These w a r n -
ings he endorsed more strongly this,
year.
Far from happy
T h e situation of I C U n i o n financ-
es is also far f r o m happy, h a v i n g
overspent this year's current income
b y about £ 2 0 0 0 — m a d e possible b y
withdrawals ( w h i c h n o w amount
over t w o years to some £3100) from
the £ 5 0 0 0 set aside as a contribut-
i o n to the furnishing of the Sports
C e n t r e .
O n l y £ 1 6 0 0 to £ 1 9 0 0 remains i n
teh Sport C e n t r e f u n d w h i c h m a y
b e w i t h d r a w n by I C U for current
expenditure. T h e U n i o n ' s other r e -
serves—£16,000 four years ago a n d
Purse strings
n o w under £ 9 0 0 0 — D r K e n W e a l e
the I C U Senior Treasurer, says are
sufficient only to p a y for maitenance
a n d replacement of U n i o n f u m i i u : e
for the next six to eight years.
T h e I C U i n o n fee of £ 4 cannot
apparently be increased until the
start of the n e w U n i v e r s i t y Grants
Committee's q u i n q u e n n i u m i n
A u t u m n 1967, despite the acceptance
b y the G o v e r n i n g B o d y i n 1964 of
an increase to £ 7 .
Interim payment
T h e only potential source of
further income is a n ex gratia i n -
terim p a y m e n t f r o m the G o v e r n i n g
B o d y . I C President A d r i a n F l e t c h e r
is of the opinion that this payment,
to b e of greatest benefit, s h o u l d b e
o n a per capita .basis " w i t h o u t
strings" a n d is hopeful that the s u m
w i l l be made available.
O t h e r members of C o u n c i l do not
share his optimism. A m o n g these is
M r R E K n i g h t , the O l d Centralians
representative, w h o , as previously
reported i n F E L I X , W a r n e d t w o
C o u n c i l meetings ago that e x p e n d -
iture must b e c u r b e d .
T h e largest item of I C U current
expenditure is that of the C l u b s
C o m m i t t e e s — £ 7 4 0 0 — 4 0 % of IC,U's
total. These bodies were set up—•
R C C as recently as 1 9 6 0 — m a i n l y to
administer the finances of their c o m -
ponent clubs a n d to distribute the
I C grant between t h e m .
No overspending
T h i s year at least no overspending
is anticipated here. Nevertheless
B r e n d o n P a r k e r , R C C C h a i r m a n ,
commented that some cuts i n ex-
penditure c o u l d be m a d e here " w i t h -
out causing too great h a r d s h i p " .
T h e three constituent college
unions together account for a
further 1 7 % of the I C U expenditure.
T h e Student F i n a n c e Committee,
caters for major items of equipment
r e q u i r e d by the clubs a n d societies
of the U n i o n . E v e r y request it re-
ceives is considered on its individual
m e r i t s — w i t h i n the context of the
£ 1 6 6 0 grant.
Entertainments cost some £ 6 0 0 ,
b u t profit on " i n f o r m a l d a n c e s " —
h o p s — m u s t be set against this. T h e
M a y B a l l is expected to have made
a slight profit this, year, but the
President's D i n n e r a n d D a n c e — f r e e
a n d b y invitatioh o n l y — w i l l this
year cost early £ 4 0 0 — a n increase of
£ 5 0 over last year.
I C W A however has a grant of £ 1
p e i capita b u t m a d e a large loss on
this year's F o r m a l a n d m a y have
overspent its budget b y £ 7 0 .
Publications should be one of the
few items to cost the U n i o n less next
year. T h e U n i o n handbook s h o u l d be
self-supporting. T h e same advertising
agency serves F E L I X , w h i c h s h o u l d
have greater success n o w that
S E N N E T has left E d u c a t i o n a l
Publicity, unless there is a n unex-
pected slump i n the student market.
F T L I X a n d the handbook s h o u l d
tiiis year cost some £ 2 4 0 a n d £ 3 0
respectively. P H O E N I X too s h o u l d
be on a Sounder financial basis next
year.
Tour cuts likely
O n e major item w h e r e cuts are
very likely to b e m a d e is the T o u i s
Subcommittee, w h i c h this year is
spending £ 9 3 0 on foreign t o u r s —
about £ 2 0 0 over its original estimate.
C o u n c i l has to decide whether to
disband the C o m m i t t e e a n d distribute
the grant between the clubs c o m m i t -
tees—as proposed b y the A C C
C h a i r m a n K e r r y P e t e r s — o r to adopt
Fletcher's suggestion that h o m e
tours should also come under the
w i n g of the Tours Subcommittee.
T h i s is regarded at least b y M i k e
E d w a r d s , unopposed candidate for
next year's chairmanship of S C C , as
undesirable. W h i c h e v e r p l a n suc-
ceeds, however, expenditure o n
tours next year is almost certain to
be kept w i t h i n a strict budget.
F i n a n c e w i l l be oen of the major
consideration of the U n i o n w h e n
selecting next year's C o u n c i l at the
U n i o n A G M tomorrow.
