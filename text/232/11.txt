K E E P YOUR RUBBISH
E V E R Y T I M E there is a f u n c t i o n in the C o n c e r t H a l l and that is a n y -
t h i n g f r o m one to four times in a week those in charge (presumably
Ents.) t h i n k that the o n l y place f o r t h e i r s u r p l u s f u r n i t u r e , flats r u b -

able q u a n t i t y of objets d'art w h i c h not o n l y u s e d u p m u c h of the
G y m but also left permanent proof of t h e i r presence o n the floor.
I n p a r t i c u l a r there was one specimen of 'op-art' about six foot l o n g
a n d h a l f a n i n c h d e e p w h i c h , short of a n e w floor, is there f o r ever.
A s I've said before the g y m m a y not be very g o o d (in fact it is a p p a l l i n g ,
but that's another tale) b u t it's the only G y m w e have or are going
to h a v e for a l o n g time to come. Respect for property seems strangely
absent at I . C . a n d p a r t i c u l a r l y so w h e n it comes to U n i o n property
u s e d b y other people.
