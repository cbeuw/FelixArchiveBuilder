George h a s often h a d strong views

U n i o n matters. H e c o n s i d e r ^ for i n -

" T h e s e days the type of people

(good mornings begin with Gilliatt)
Every Sunday morning you can enjoy the razor-
sharp theatre reviews of Penelope Gilliatt. She
brings a fresh, astringent intelligence to the
job. You may disagree violently with what she
says but you wijl relish the style with which
she says it. If you are tired of the jaded, pre-
dictable opinions of the establishment critics,
begin next Sunday morning with Gilliatt. You'll
find it a refreshing change.
In The Observer every Sunday
are unable to get into t h e m a n d m i x
w i t h older people, a n d i n general
m a k e n o further effort.
G e o r g e is also u n h a p p y w i t h the
U n i o n ' s Presidential election system.
T h e argument that a p o p u l a r d e m o -
cratic vote is useless because first-
y e a r students w i l l n o t k n o w the
personalities is i n v a l i d , h e says, since
the elections a r e h e l d i n t h e s u m m e r
t e r m , b y w h i c h time everyone s h o u l d
have h a d a chance to find o u t about
the l i k e l y candidates.
George is n o t just destructively
critical however. H e has. praise i n
particular for three of t h e Presidents
he has k n o w n — G a r n e t , H i l l a n d
F l e t c h e r — f o r the w a y they have
h e l d the U n i o n d o w n i f necessary
a n d their ability to m a k e ' decisions
a n d get things done efficiently. O f
the Icwarians he comments, " T h e y ' r e
far more grateful for the things y o u
do for them than a n y of t h e m e n
are." H e w o u l d l i k e to see m o r e
girls here i n future years as they
w o u l d u n d o u b t e d l y alter the
character of the C o l l e g e for t h e
better. G e o r g e has b e c o m e a pretty
s h r e w d judge of character over h i s
years at I C a n d reckons that he c a n
assess those w h o are likely to get
t h r o u g h t h e C o l l e g e successfully
after a couple of meetings.
H i s retirement? H e fears that h e
w i l l not be able to persuade h i s w i f e
