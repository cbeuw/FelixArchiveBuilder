Cumbrian thanks
Sir,
May I congratulate Mr. C . G . H . on
his excellent article devoted to our
equally excellent but much underrat-
ea University?
T h e facts as he stated them Were
correct, but there are one or two
points I should like to clear up.
Although Carlisle has just under
two thousand students, it is unfair
to say that there are only four
hundred reading "sciences", since the
Srinciple aim of the courses offered
ere is to break down the barrier
that is usually not only erected, but
guarded with barbed wire and dogs,
between "arts" and "sciences". There
is an optional changeover at the era!
of each year designed so that students
may take a course of two years Of
arts subjects with a year of sciena*
Spoilt" tickets
Sir.
I wonder if it would be po»*ibk>,
through the pages of your paper, to
throw some light upon a matter
which puzzled me in the Carnival
Raffle Draw. A ticket was drawp and
after brief (several seconds Would be
• generous estimate) inspection by
Mr. Rutstein end equally brief con-
sultation with, hi* partner, was ap-
parently rejected. Trie reason given
was that the ticket wa# illegible. If
this be so why are the tickets
numbered? Surely when such a grand
prize as a Mini is at stake, rather
more concern should be displayed b y
those responsible to ensure that die
draw is conducted fairly and is seen
to be conducted fairly. I do hot like
to think of someone buying a raffle
ticket in support of our Charity in
all good faith being cheated or his
prize in this manner. I might also
add th,at M r . Rutstein was involved
in another raffle later that day and
went to considerable pains to dft
cipher the name of tiie winner of a
can of soup! It seems he does not
even believe in being consistently un-
fair. I hope you can clarify this,
situation for me.

Carnival Draw Organizer,
Ron Rubstein, tells F E L I X that
it had been agreed prior to the
draw that if any of the many
doubtful or illegible tickets be
drawn, these tickets would be
ignored and others drawn. This
was due to the lack of time
before Saturday, the day of the
cricket matches prediction of
the aggregate scores of which
form* the basis of the compet-
ition for the Mini. T h e decision
of the organizer, as stated on
the tickets, is final

Quite a lot was said in the article
about our buildings—the Union, tho
halls, etc- They are truly impressive.
What a pity the photograph did not
portray the glorious laboratories,
containing may thousands of pounds
worth of up-to-date equipmet. includ-
ing, a medium-sized I B M computer,
which, incidentally, is available for
student use at any time.
As the article pointed out the
Mace-debating competition, when we
came all the way from Carlisle to
London (to play U C ) , represented the
height of the fame of the Union,
now out-topped by your splendid
article.

Life has tew sights more poign-
ant than Felix preparing its last is-
sue of the year. Bilious, leafing
through past issues for inspiration
for his last leader and finding they
all seem to read the same; the new
editor staring blankly at the state-
ments of Felix's present financial
situation, mumbling 'Incredible!* oc-
casionally uneonsoled by the
toadyings around him, foretaste of
the power to come; and the column,
tsts, unscathed, unreviled, unread.
The dedicated few
D U ,
I would like through your columns
to thank the small band of workers
—''dedicated" is rather hackneyed,
bat what other word if there?—who
made this year's Carnival effort pot-
able.
Their work is "beset by apathetic
non-respon«e to requests fof help ana
haphazard participation.
Cannot those in responsible positions
within the Societies reolve now to
make a more prompt and positive
contribution to next year's Carnival?

unnoticed wondering if perhaps
they ve failed. Surely I should have
earned some greater calumny than
Father Ivor telling me I'm 'sleazy'
(just writing down to my readers,
Father).. It's his job to say that,
after all. Does there not lie buried,
at the beery bottom of some
athletic college politician's heart, a
small dagger of hate for me, his
tireless tormentor (until I lost my
anonymity that is)?
But nothing can dim the memory
for me of Our Editor, in his finest
hour, the great words thundering
forth: 'So long as I am Editor of
this paper I shall see that it re-
mains an organ of free speech, ...
and that Ignotus and Colcutt will
remain anonymous until their last
offerings...' I remember it well,
becairfre it appeared alongside our
last contributions under those
names. Such a shame he couldn't
print that piece I did on the Felix
party, with special reference to
him...

The Kaldo steel-making process. Today, over half of Britain's steel comes from processes developed within the past ten years.
Take a good look at steel and the road to top management. In the highly
advanced technological world of steel, there is call for graduates with many
different scientific and engineering qualifications. There are exciting opportu-
nities in companies all over the country to work on new projects as well as in
production, plant maintenance and quality control.
Above all, the steel industry offers opportunities to progress to top-line manage-
ment, as many of today's leaders in the industry have proved. For details of
