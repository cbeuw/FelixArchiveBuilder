Melville-Smith Trophy
I.C. W E R E N A R R O W L Y
B E A T E N in the second round
of the Melville-Smith teams of
four trophy, by last years win-
ners—who included three inter-
nationals in their team. Tho
margin of defeat was three in-
ternational match points (imps),
corresponding approximately tq
100 ordinary aggregate points,
which over a match of 30 hands
represents only a very small, dif-
ference. There were plenty of big
swings on individual hands, the
largest of which was in our
favour on the following hand.

After Easfs distributional open-
ins bid on a meamre ten points the
bidding proceeded on a fatrlv
orthodox line u p to South'* 3S r>'d.
This posed a problem for West, far
South by his original double had i m
lied .shortage in chearts. However
West reasoned that since-both North
and South h a d been biddinw quite
freely, partner's hand must be dis-
tributional, and with agreement a l -
ready cpnfirmed jn the Club suit,
«nd ,M -first round control in the
Diamond suit. 4 H would seem * fair
proposition. There were no difficult-
ies' at all in making the contract, with
5 tricks in hearts, four in clubs and
the ace of diamonds.

South might have doubled on the
rfist round instead of bidding IS, but
the final contract would probably
have been the same. North passed
3 H i n the hope that the opponents
would not reach game, but he decid-
ed to sacrifice when they bid 4 H .
It would appear superficially that
4S can be made with 5 spade tricks
as well as two heart ruffs- in the
shore trump hand (South), and three
diamond tricks, making ten tricks in
all. This contract can however be
thwarted b y intelligent and%6fd de-
fence. After West's marked opening
of the two of spades declarer wins
in hand with the KS, and plays J H ,
which has to be ducked into East's
hand, otherwise declarer can take a
finnesse through East (lead
the Q H if East does not cover with
the King). N e w comes the crucial
play b y East of underleading the
A , K C to get partner in with the
Q C , so that he can lead another
spade. N o matter how declarer pro-
ceeds from this point he is bound to
bo defeated. T h e low club return
at the third trick fs essential, tor it
East had played the K C or returned
a diamond declarer would have been
one tempo ahead of the defence a n d
must have made his contract In act-
ual fact, East led the ten of diamonds,
at trick 3 so South was able to
make his doubled contract for a
score of + 790 to N - S ; with a score
of + 160 to E - W at the other tab'.o
the net swing to I.C. was 1410 on
the hand, corresponding to 16 imps.

Peace Offensive
The spread of conscription in the
U.S.A. to university students and
rumours that the British committ-
ment to the Vietnam war will i n -
crease have suddenly made Vietnam
a matter of personal concern to I C
students. In response to student
doubts here the I C C N D are devoting
this week to a "peace offensive",
aiming to answer some of their
questions.
The week will give the chance for
people here to hear and see facts
about this war and others, and to
discuss the situation. This is the
basis for the decision as to how I C
can best contribute, within the
scope of student activity, -to a peace-
ful settlement of the war. Campaign-
ing should not last for just one week,
and I C C N D have a large programme
for next year.
