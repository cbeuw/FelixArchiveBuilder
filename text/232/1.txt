A time for awards and mutual backslapping — but
Union must tighten
its purse strings
"A waste of
public funds"
—Pain
A F E L I X investigation
T H E R O Y A L C O L L E G E of
Science Union has considerably
overspent its income for the
second successive year. The
Royal School of Mines Union ex-
pects to break even, or perhaps
show a small surplus. The City
and Guilds College Loion ex-
pects to carry over to next year a
balance greater than that car-
ried over last summer. And Im-
perial College Union has bitten
a further £1700 into its Sports
Centre reserve.
R C S U is effectively "broke". This
point emerged at their General Com-
mittee joint meeting on Thursday,
when the Senior Treasurer, M r H J
Pain, revealed that liquid reserves
were exhausted and it seemed that
liabilities total more than the value
of stocks—mainly "Gilt E d g e d " —
held by RCS, though President Scott
doobted it.
T h i s serious position has arisen
since the T y e administration of
1963/4 left l i q u i d reserevs of £ 4 8 5
a n d stocks w o r t h £ 1 0 0 0 . T h e p r o -
portions i n w h i c h the loss is shared
between the S a d h v a n i a n d Scott a d -

R C S President refused F E L I X per-
mission to see the aciounts or to i n -
terview M r P a i n .

In contrast, D i c k G a s h , President
of M i n e s , said " O u r booksv are per-

Senior Treasurer, expects the U n i o n
to carry over " a small S u m " to next

In both of these unions the Senior

Jazz Club
thefts cloud
Carnival
D U R I N G C A R N I V A L W E E K
three musical instruments, a clarinet,
a trumpet and a guitar were taken
from the Jazz Club Room. Since the
guitar was being played on Wednes-
day evening and the instruments were
found to be missing on Thursday
lunchtime it is assumed that the
theft ocurred during or after the
Midnight Film Festival.
A t no time d u r i n g the period
T u e s d a y l u n c h t i m e (when the clarinet
was last played) to Thursday l u n c h -
time was, the Jazz C l u b room both
u n l o c k e d a n d unattended a n d since
the door bore no evidence of hav-
ing been forced it is thought that a
duplicate key was used, a l l other keys
h a v i n g been accounted for.
Chelsea P o l i c e a n d I C Internal
Security are both at present attempt-
ing tp trace the thieves. It w o u l d
greatly assist these people if anyone
w h o saw any person carrying tha
clarinet (in a small black case), the
trumpet (in a black case), or t h *
guitar (pinewood w i t h n o case)
d u r i n g the night of the F i l m Festival
c o u l d contact either M r . H e n r y (IC
Security Office) or A l a n F r i e n d (via
U n i o n Rack).
T h e instruments taken were not
the most valuable i n the room at the
time and it is assumed that the tfcieves
suffered f r o m a w a r p e d sense of
humour.
