Why a l l t h i s f u s s a b o u t gowns? I f only
those who w a n t e d to wear them, wore thern, t h e
p u b l i c would a t l a s t know t h a t U n i v e r s i t y
Students throng t h e s t r e e t s o f S o u t h K e n s i n g -
ton. U n f o r t u n a t e l y i t seems v.e r e q u i r e some
reason f o r wearing them. Many o f u s h a v e
been so weighty i n our o p i n i o n s , o b s c u r i n g
the simple reason f o r wearing a c a d e m i c c i r e s s .

We are, by d e f i n i t i o n , U n i v e r s i t y stud-
ents and are t h e r e f o r e e n t i t l e d to wear gowns
J n l i k e some other c o l l e g e s we are not, f o r -
t u n a t e l y , oompelled to wear them. Therefore,
should we do so i t i s through our own w i l l
and because we are proud to be s t u d e n t s of
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e . Make no mistake! I t oan
be e a s i l y shown that we have every r i g h t to
be most proud of e v e r y t h i n g concerning our
p o s i t i o n as students of I.C.
F i r s t l y , of o u r s e l v e s . By p e r s o n a l
e f f o r t each one of us has earned the r i g h t to
be c a l l e d a student of I.C. and a member of
one of the g r e a t e s t U n i v e r s i t i e s i n the world.
We work while we are hero, hard and w i t h l o n g
hours. A l l of us have t o cope with s p e c i a l
problems whioh a f f e c t our work.
Secondly, our own C o l l e g e . I n addition,
to a deserved f i n e academic r e p u t a t i o n , i t
has a Union. A Union, organised by our-
selves, where we oan develop our p a r t i c u l a r
i n t e r e s t s and .which has made the word
"Imperial" respected throughout the Clubs and
S o c i e t i e s of our U n i v e r s i t y , and beyond.
We have every reason to show our p r i d e
i n being students - and students of I m p e r i a l
C o l l e g e .
A gown i s e a s i l y obtained, and i s r e l a -
t i v e l y cheap c o n s i d e r i n g i t i s hand-made. On,
ileaving c o l l e g e I t may be s o l d to defray p a r t
i of the i n i t i a l c o s t . I t i s i n t e r e s t i n g t h a t
most students have t h e i r blue c o l l e g e b l a z e r s
tailor-made. An o r d i n a r y b l a z e r of the same
q u a l i t y ( w i t h I.C. b a d g e ) and a gown,oosts
l e s s than a t a i l o r e d b l a z e r . A gown i s
black and t h e r e f o r e seldom r e q u i r e s c l e a n i n g !
I t i s a l s o an e x c e l l e n t o v e r a l l , p i n a f o r e and
I d u s t s h e e t - exoept where moving machinery i s I
h e i n g used i n the Lab, when the gown should ,
Jbe taken o f f and hung on a peg. .
I t i s not regimentation, n e i t h e r i s i t
snobbery to wear, of our own f r e e w i l l , a
gown - i t i s our deserved p r i v i l e g e . L e t
us use t h i s p r i v i l e g e w h i l s t we have the
b r i e f opportunity.
