Dear S i r ,
In your recant a r t i c l e on the Hops t h i s
tern you mention the unsuitable nature of the r e c -
ords f o r dancing. Could I add my plea f o r a
better s e l e c t i o n of records. Most of the vocal num-
bers have no discernable rhythm at a l l and are hence
impossible to even attempt to dance to. Could we
please have a few more s t r i c t tempo numbers, when
perhaps fewer people would be seen s t r u g g l i n g to
waltz or f o x t r o t to a quickstep tune.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
I.G. HacBean.
Dear S i r ,
How many of us smiled s c o r n f u l l y when we
read the wording on our Guy Fawkes hop t i c k e t s ?
But i n the shame of our ignorance we could not
know that what seemed to us a c h i l d i s h s p e l l i n g
error was Instead an adult s u b t l e t y of word, a
nuance of meaning, that our guiding l i g h t , o u r Un-
-ion. had thought f i t to reveal to us.
THEY d i d not need to seek the Shorter
Oxford to know t h a t .

From 7 p.m. these sweet greetings of the l i p s were
to be f r e e ; and i n our hearts we ithanked) THEM f o r
allowing us the chance, I f we were early, to capture
Just-one wind blown buss before i t soared to Autumn's
s t a r r y heavens.
I remain, S i r ,

Dear S i r ,
I must r e g i s t e r a s t r o n g p r o t e s t at the i n -
c o n s i s t e n c y i n the supply of the beef and yeast
e x t r a c t , M-rm-t-( to the New Lounge Snack Bar.
Whenever p o s s i b l e , my lunch-time d i e t c o n s i s t s of
s i x or e i g h t sandwiches f i l l e d with t h i s p r e c i o u s
f o o d s t u f f . I t i s on t h i s , and a d a i l y quota of
blaok beer, that I depend f o r the energy and
stamina t h a t i s r e q u i r e d f o r the strenous course
for which the School of Mines i s noted.
A l a s , S i r , every three weeks or so, the sup-
ply of M-rm-t- i n the snack bar runs out and i t i s
o f t e n a week before the stock i s r e p l e n i s h e d . I

Dear S i r ,
Despite overcrowding, the Guy Fawkes
celebrations passed o f f reasonably s u c c e s s f u l l y .
However, I think that t h e i r organisation should
be a l t e r e d f o r future years. I do not see why,
Just because the function i s held at Harlington,
the brunt of the work involved should be borne
by o f f i c i a l s of the a t h l e t i c clubs, who already
have t h e i r hands f u l l .
This year, f o r example, the Soccer Club
had t h e i r 1st round cup match on Saturday, Nov.6th,
and had arranged a p r a c t i c e match on the previous
Wednesday. I t seems most u n f a i r that the o f f i c i a l s
of the soccer club were burdened with the resp-
o n s i b i l i t y of b u i l d i n g the f i r e -a very consid-
e r a b l e task which they performed very well -
during this* c r u c i a l p e r i o d . In f a c t tha Captain
had to miss nearly a l l the T r i a l Match which was
consequently almost useless. The Rugger and Hock-
-ey o f f i c i a l s - also with Cup Matches approaching
- were s i m i l a r l y obliged to carry out tasks
which could w e l l have been performed by people
with less r e s p o n s i b i l i t y already i n t h e i r hands.
I suggest that i n future the whole a f f a i r
should be run by a Guy Fawkes committee which sho
-uld c o n s i s t l a r g e l y of those people who other-
wise contribute l i t t l e to the Union, but who a l -
-ways turn up to such functions as t h i s .
Even the c l e a r i n g up on Saturday morning
was l e f t to about a dozen people, mostly aem-
-bers of the Rugger Club. When an attempt was
made to persuade people to help with t h i s on the
previous night, a profusion of absurd excuses
was o f f e r e d , of which the most abysmal was "work-
-ing"I
Whether the whole a f f a i r i s worth the
very considerable expense which i t e n t a i l s , Just •
to keep I.C.students o f f the London s t r e e t s , Is
another problem. Personally I think the money
Involved - aaid to be about a hundred pounds -
could be put to a b e t t e r purpose.
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,
