U.L.CUP COMPETITION - lit ROUND
I.C. 5. - NEC. I
The I.C. 1st XI surmounted t h e i r second
h u r d l e i n the U.L. Cup Competition a t the expense
of N.E.C. on Sat. 6th November. On a d u l l ,
miserable day, when the c o n d i t i o n s were a l l
a g a i n s t good f o o t b a l l the I.C. team proved them-
s e l v e s worthy winners with a score o f 5 goals
to 1.
The game began with the play q u i t e even on
both s i d e s with each team a t t a c k i n g v i g o u r o u s l y ,
although I.C. looked the more l i k e l y t o score.
However, with the c o n d i t i o n very treacherous
underfoot i t took some time f o r the teams t o mas-
t e r the d i f f i c u l t i e s . I.C. were the f i r s t t o do
so and a f t e r s e v e r a l near misses the home team
took the l e a d with a g o a l scored by Hodge.
At h a l f - t i m e the score was s t i l l 1-0 but with
more accurate s h o o t i n g N.E.C. might have had t o
f a c e a b i g g e r d e f i c i t . I.C. were now i n the
ascendancy and p l a y i n g as a team with every man
doing h i s job very w e l l , and i t only seemed t o be
a matter of time b e f o r e more g o a l s would oome.
But i n one of N.E.C.'a sporadic r a i d s on the I.C.
goal the e q u a l i s e r came a f t e r a mix up amongst
the I.C. defenders. T h i s produced great c o n s t e r -
n a t i o n amongst the f o u r v a l i a n t supporters who
had v i s i o n s of the p r e l i m i n a r y round when t h e
r e s u l t was undecided u n t i l the l a s t few minutes.
The e q u a l i s i n g goal had an amazing e f f e c t on
the I.C. team. They p u l l e d t h e i r socks up and
goals then came a t r e g u l a r i n t e r v a l s u n t i l the
end o f the match. N.E.C. c o u l d n o t cope with a
much f i t t e r and f a s t e r team and they f e l l t o
p i e c e s , hodge cOmpleted'a nat u r i c x ana ureen

RUGGER
Since the l a s t issue of Felix the Rugby Club has
suffered one narrow defeat at the hands of
Saracens Ex 1st but had two f a i r l y comfortable
wins i n the preceding games.
The superiority of the I.C. backs over Borough
Road and some fine goal kicking by Lewis enabled
us to defeat them by 20pts to n i l , and on the
following Saturday I.C. had no d i f f i c u l t y i n de-
feating Rosslyn Park A by 25pts to n i l i n a some-
what scrappy game .
The following week, playing away to Saracens
Ex 1st on a rain soaked pitch, the I.C. banks had
most of the play while the balliremalned dry, and
the forwards gained possession from the tight
scrummages. The b a l l soon became extremely greasy
however, and following a mishandle the opposition
scored a break away try from the half way line
which was unconverted. In the second half the play
was dominated by the heavier and more experienced
pack of the opposition, but despite this the I.C.
defenoe held and there was no further score.
