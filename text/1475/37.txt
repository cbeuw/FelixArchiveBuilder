Scorpio
This week you participate in the tug of
war between ChemSoc and CivSoc. You
add a novel twist, tying willies together
if you’re a bloke, nipples if you’re a
gal. A mistake as much pain ensues -
although one lecturer excitedly screams
“spank me baby!”

Horoscopes
Aries
After spending last week on Facebook,
you have now become one of those an-
noying prats that excessively uses smi-
leys in your text messages :p :p. Anyone
who needs to convey emotion and senti-
ment via the use of teenage punctuation
systems is not worth my time of day XD
Taurus
You wake on Tuesday to find you are
Harry Potter. OMG! Now’s your chance
to fuck Hermione. You shit all over each
other, and go at like rabbits until the sun
rises on your love pool of semen, faeces,
and vaginal juices only to realise you’re
not Harry and you just did your sister.
Gemini
You meet the girl of your dreams. You
want to say hi, but being a timid geek
you go home and long for the day when
fate lets your paths cross again. IT
WON’T. Life is not a rehearsal; either
tell her or console yourself by wanking
with your least favoured hand.
Cancer
You believe the middle classes are
discouraged from breeding because
it is jolly expensive. But for those on
benefits, there is every incentive. Well,
that’s not a very sensible policy. You tell
everyone your views. You spend the rest
of the week apologising.
Leo
You have nothing better to do this week
other than write comments on the Felix
website about your disdain for the qual-
ity of the articles. Ironic, seeing as your
comments are even shitter - you spastic,
fuckbag, monstrous nightmare of a cunt.
Have an opinion? Keep it to yourself.
Virgo
You are a man. You manage to gain
access to the Ann Summers party at
Reynolds Bar on Saturday Night. In
your excitment, you get your cock out
and whack it in chicks’ faces ‘cos you
think that’s what they dig. WHABAM!!
In fact, they don’t. You get arrested.
Libra
This week you are the Pope. You real-
ise condoms might actually prevent the
spread of HIV. Well done, you dumb
fuck. Once again, you are lightyears be-
hind everyone else. It was only in 1992
that you acknowledged the earth rotates
around the sun *slow clapping*
Sagittarius
Your queer friend wants to test your
gayness level. You protect yourself with
the help of Margaret Thatcher, declaring
“This penis is not for turning!” But your
friend, inspired by Peter Mandelson,
brings new meaning to the phrase “The
Prince of Darkness.”
Capricorn
This week, you are the perennial
underachiever. You only make it to
Deputy Felix editor (2 yrs running). You
are the Nick Clegg of Felix. You can
shout your orders, but this astrologist
only reports to the big boss. You are no
enforcer. Dream on.
Aquarius
You get trapped in your bathroom, with
no phone or window. It is 20 days before
anyone notices you are missing. You are
rescued by a gallant fireman. You thank
him by saying “You shouldn’t have been
so fucking busy with those Chileans.”
Pisces
As the stars align in the northern
hemisphere, you realise that there are
no truths, only perspectives. Unless you
are Nick Griffin or George Galloway, in
which case you are definitely 100% a
massive dickfuck.

DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
Oh Harry Soljak, what would your mother say? Actually she’d probably be really turned on, she loves this kind of
stuff. I mean the first time I was a bit reluctant but hey, I’m an easy-going guy...
