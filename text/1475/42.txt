Last week saw ICU Snooker’s first internal
tournament of the year, the Freshers’ Tourna-
ment. After many of Imperial’s first team grad-
uated last year, eyes were on the freshers to im-
press and work their way in to the team to help
defend our BUCS gold medal later in the year.
Entrants to this year’s tournament ranged
from absolute beginners through to a national
champion.
Finalist Jonathan Morrow had the most event-
ful route to the final, beating Jonathan Hoong
2-1 in the quarterfinal from 1-0 down, and more
impressively coming from 2-1 behind to secure
his place in the final, beating Bobo Kijac 3-2.
Meeting Jonathan in the final was one of Ro-
mania’s finest, Bogdan Cozmaciuc. Bogdan
had reached the final winning all his matches in
straight frames and registering the two highest
breaks of the tournament.
So the final was set, the unbeaten Bogdan
Cozmaciuc versus the come-back king Jona-
than Morrow. As expected, Bogdan took an
early lead in the best of seven match, claiming
the first three frames. The scene was set for an-
other amazing come-back from Jonathan Mor-
row, but could he actually come back to claim
Freshers’ tournament 2010 victory and be the
subject of one of the finest underdog stories of
all time?
No!
Bogdan left his mark as Imperial’s best new-
bie, claiming the final 4-0 and keeping his un-
beaten record.
Coached by his father, who gained coach-
ICU Snooker discover
fresher Champion
The intense stare that every (fresher) Champion has is not lacking here
ing qualifications from the prestigious Terry
Griffiths’ Snooker Academy, Bogdan has also
competed in European and World Champion-
ships, and played professionals Mark King and
the legendary Jimmy White.
Next in Bogdan’s sights is the Internal
League, where the entire club competes in a
league and knockout format to find the clubs
number one. Surely a prize he is longing to
put next to his already earned title of ‘National
Champion of Romania’ in the under-19 and
mens categories.
Sign up for the Internal League is now open
to all ICU Snooker members. For all those who
feel beating the likes of Bogdan and reigning
champion Sam Dennis is a steep challenge, there
are two tiers to allow players of any standard a
long and prosperous tournament experience.
Sports personality draws near
David Wilson
On the 19th of December the BBC will host the
57th annual Sports Personality of Year awards
at the LG Arena in Birmingham. Many people
may think that this has been a relatively lean
year as far as British sport is concerned, there
hasn’t been too much to shout about especially
as the ‘golden generation’ of English football
failed so miserably at the World Cup. There
have, however, been a number of sporting
achievements of note.
Graeme McDowell won the US Open this
year and in doing so became the first European
to win that major in 40 years. Not only that, but
McDowell played in the final singles match of
the Ryder Cup and sunk the final putt which
ensured that the cup rightfully returned to Eu-
rope. Such exploits mean that McDowell will
be favourite for the award this year.
Not to be outdone by his compatriot, Lee
Westwood is the current world number one, a
pretty big achievement when you consider than
the previous incumbent of that title was a cer-
tain Mr Tiger Woods who had stood at the sum-
mit of world golf for 281 weeks before West-
wood knocked him off of his perch.
February seems like a long time ago, but
during that month Amy Williams won gold at
the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, throw-
ing herself down an open topped tunnel made
of ice on a slab of metal. Williams won a gold
medal in the skeleton event, the first Briton to
win an individual gold at the winter Olympics
for 30 years. The low profile of winter sports
means that Williams is likely to be an outsider
for the title this and any other year.
Mark Cavendish won five stages of the Tour
de France this year and save for a relatively
poor start to the tour he would have won the
coveted green sprint jersey. Cavendish is a
volatile person who tends to stay away from
the media as he feels he is often misrepresent-
ed. A strong fourth place finish in last years
Sports Personality competition means that he
could well be in contention for the title this
year.
Jessica Ennis didn’t compete in too many
competitions this season but still managed to
add the European title to her growing medal
haul as well as captaining the British side at the
Aviva International meet in Glasgow. The post-
er girl of the 2012 Olympics competed in only
a limited amount of competitions this season in
order to focus on upcoming London Olympics.
Tom Daley overcame Delhi belly to win two
Commonwealth gold medals. To put this in per-
spective, Daley is 16 years old and he beat the
2008 Olympic champion in order to win the in-
dividual Commonwealth title. Daley has youth
on his side and will likely win many more med-
als over the coming years.
David Haye would surely have been in with a
shout of the title if he had fought anyone other
than Fr-Audley ‘A-Farce’ Harrison earlier this
month. Unifying the heavyweight division is
Haye’s aim in the coming year and perhaps
with it the Sports Personality title.
Last year produced a shock winner in the
form of Ryan Giggs, so this year John Terry
could win Sports Personality with Fabio Ca-
pello collecting the coach award.
