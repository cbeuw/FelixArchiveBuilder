If you’ve ever played minesweeper, then
you should be able to understand this
puzzle. The number in each box repre-
sents the number of lines that can exist
around it. Lines can never cross! In the
end, you will end up with a closed loop.
Just have a look at the solution in the op-
posite page.

Don’t look so surprised y’all, you know
how this works by now, surely? Every
row, column and three by three square
must contain each letter once. The
end result is a rather useless word or
