W
ith the £2.5 million
renovation of the
Union’s entertain-
ment venues finally
complete, the overall
student response is one of enthu-
siasm - but how does the newly re-
furbished FiveSixEight bar stand up
against other student union bars
across London? Felix set out to in-
vestigate just what draws students
to rival establishments and whether
other London universities have got
the upper hand, or if Imperial Col-
lege Union has spent its money in
all the right places.

HOW DOES OUR
UNION COMPARE?
There is “a good selection of beers” and the bar
“functions quite well and the drinks are cheap
enough”. Some criticisms were that the layout
“prevents more people sitting and having drinks”.
Student opinions
Imperial – FiveSixEight The Kriss Akabusi
Pleasure Lounge – UCL
SOAS - SOAS Bar
The price of beer in FiveSixEight is one of the
cheapest compared to other Unions. For wine
and shots the prices are of comparable price to
others. The design and quality of the bar was far
beyond any other university, but that’s what you
get when you spend £2.5 million.
Student opinions
Two UCL 3rd years were less than impressed
with the “absurdly expensive ales”. They said that
FiveSixEight would have to be made of gold for it
to be worth the long trip” to South Kensington.
The UCL bar is much larger than Imperial’s but
this ruins the atmosphere when less full. A less
robust entertainment program than FiveSixEight
promises discounted drinks on certain nights,
with some selected drinks being as low as £1
alongside such deals as 4 pint pitchers for £4.
An anthropolgy PhD student said that the bar was
“awesome and cheap”, explaining that friendly bar
staff, dressed in casual wear rather than uniforms,
helped contribute towards a more relaxed bar.
Student opinions SOAS’ bar is casual to the extreme, resembling
a backpacker hostel if anything. Two pool tables
were in full use by students and there was even a
microwave for students to use. In terms of events,
SOAS does not provide a great deal in the bar it-
self, with a quiz night the main regular highlight.
The Duck and Dive – ULU
Student opinions
We gained an positive overall impression about
the bar from the students with one masters stu-
dent telling us she came to the bar every day and
that she “wouldn’t change a thing”.
One of ULU’s student union bars, The Duck &
Dive has a professional look and numerous televi-
sion screens showing sports. There were deals on
food, with 2 burgers available for £6 on Tuesdays
and Thursdays. There is a strong lineup of daily
events with a focus on reduced alcohol prices.
LSE - The Three Tuns
There were few positive comments about Crush.
One student said, “it’s terrible.” The students also
commented that they often visit King’s College
Union due to its close proximity.
Student opinions This was the biggest disappointment. The entire
room was completely devoid of anyone by 10pm
and last orders were called before 10:30pm. LSE
often holds popular student nights in its bars
such as Crush or Candybox, alongside comedy
nights for just £3 compared with UCL’s £8 entry.
Tutu’s – King’s College
Student opinions
A group of SOAS Freshers said that it was “amaz-
ing” and that they would “come back often”. Upon
hearing of Imperial College Union’s new renova-
tion, they expressed interest in visiting.
Similar in taste to Imperial’s Eastside Bar, Tutu’s
has a fantastic view of London’s skyline across
the river. With a separate website for events, the
Union attracts popular comedians and perform-
ers. Entry for club nights is often £3 but for more
prominent acts entry goes as high as £16.
