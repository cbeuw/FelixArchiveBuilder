Royal College of
Art students block
Kensington Road
Around 200 students from the Royal
College of Art (RCA) held an hour
long protest as part of a national day of
walkouts, sit-ins and marches against
the government’s planned cuts to higher
education.
They began on the steps of the RCA
building at 1pm but quickly moved to
Kensington Road where they proceeded
to block traffic by occupying the road.
The students chanted “You say cutback,
we say fightback” as motorists became
more and more annoyed by the disrup-
tion. Motorcyclists forced their way past
the students while some cars attempted
to nudge the students out of the way.
One driver used his car to force a way
through the crowd, driving with a stu-
dent on his bonnet for around 5 metres.
A van driver got out of his car to argue
with the demonstrators before shouted
down by the crowd. being
13 police officers arrived in 8 police
cars and forced the students back onto
Kadhim Shubber
the pavement.
Cordelia Cembrowicz, Vice President
of the Royal College of Art Students’
Union said “Cutting government fund-
ing along with increasing fees for art
and design students will have a negative
effect on not only our economy but on
the very lifeblood of our culture. This
nation needs artists, designers and musi-
cians just as much as it needs mathema-
ticians, engineers and scientists.”
The protest died down shortly after
2pm, with one student commenting that
she was cold and had work to get on
with.
Jarvis Cocker was rumoured to be
leading the protest but wasn’t present on
the day.
