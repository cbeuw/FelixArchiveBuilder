COMMENT
T
his week I played some vid-
eogames. You might think
that this isn’t particularly
announcement–worthy in
an age of Farmville and Be-
jewelled. On the face of it, videogames
are part of our culture now. But read a
gaming fansite or web forum and you’d
be forgiven for thinking we were in the
middle of a cultural apartheid.
Does anyone actually care about vide-
ogames any more? I’m talking about the
giggling disdain that used to be poured
on people who play them. I’m not sure
this actually exists any more, and weird-
ly, the gaming hardcore seem to be pin-
ing for its return. Mike Channell wrote
on the Official XBox Magazine Blog
that “Games won’t get you the girl -
yet” last week. The piece is a genuinely
unbelievable anecdote about meeting a
‘reasonably cute’ girl (so kind, Mike) at
a game launch party.
Bearing in mind that Miss Above Av-
erage Looks was attending a party de-
signed to celebrate a videogame, Mike
claims she was surprised and disgusted
to learn what Mike did for a living. If
she really was surprised, then that’s
Angry Geek
some remarkable ignorance on her part.
Maybe she thought the party was cel-
ebrating some new, very interactive film
or something. Mike goes on to explain
how horrible she was, and then remark
that her kind is ‘dying out’, in a rather
ominous sentence. Then it’s time for the
rallying call. Over to Mike for this bit:
“We’re not there yet, though, and you
and I are just leading the charge. No
matter how cool it is that more people
are gaming...there are still going to be
people who think we’re worthless hu-
man belly button fluff. But you know
what? They’re wrong and we’re right.
Remember that.”
Please bear in mind that Mike reviews
videogames in exchange for a monthly
salary. He isn’t leading a guerilla re-
sistance movement or fighting against
social oppression. Instead of playing
games in the evening, someone is will-
ing to pay him to do it during the day,
on the condition he writes about them a
bit. That’s it. He closes with this killer
shot: “Farewell angry lady, I hope one
day you’re having as much fun as I am.”
ZING. Don’t hold out, Mike! Go for
the jugular!
Here’s the thing; videogames are cool
now. Almost everyone plays them, and
very few people genuinely would be
disgusted to meet someone who wrote
about them for a living. Of course, that
gave gamers an identity: The Underdog.
Now that’s gone, it seems some of them
- particularly journalists, for whom this
role generated a lot of material - are real-
ising that role hasn’t been replaced with
something exciting or sexy. They’re
now just ‘dude who plays videogames’.
So this week, readers, I played vide-
ogames. That’s it. Maybe you read a
book. I respect your choice of entertain-
ment and don’t wish to bring any judge-
ment against you. However, if you see
any Mike Channells out there this week,
be sure to round them up and execute
them on sight. The only thing making
gaming unpopular these days are the
ove rcompensating twunts who thought
it would always be that way.
Are you, or is someone you know,
Mike Channell? Do you know some-
one affected by Mike Channell?

arack Obama has some-
thing in common with the
England Football team.
For good or bad, he made
politics interesting again
during the 2008 Presidential campaign.
Yet since he has been in power, his ap-
proval ratings have started to drop as
people realise with just how unreachable
their levels of expectation were.
Meanwhile, at every World Cup or
European Championship, and each
time England hires a new manager the
entire country cries “Football’s coming
home!” the inevitable ensues, as Eng-
land fall embarrassingly far of their am-
bitions. The fans are as deluded as the
Apprentice candidates.
The final straw came last Wednesday
when France beat a dismal three lions
2-1 on English turf, at Wembley.
This summer, France had the worst
World Cup of all football powerhouses
– after only qualifying thanks to the
hand of Thierry Henry. They mustered
only one point in the group stages, los-
ing to lightweights Mexico and South
Africa. The players went on strike (it is
their national sport) boycotting a train-
ing session, and their best striker Nico-
las Anelka was sent home like a naughty
school boy.
That England only had a marginally
Charles Betts
better World Cup is not the issue. It is
their respective responses to a tourna-
ment as poor as the latest Justin Bieber
single that are markedly different.
The French players apologised to the
fans. Manager Raymond Domenech
was swiftly ushered out, and in his place
came Laurent Blanc. In his first game in
charge, Blanc suspended every player
from the World Cup squad as a collec-
tive punishment. Wednesday’s victory
was another step towards the team’s
gradual renewal.
England responded to a dismal so-
journ in South Africa by keeping Fabio
Capello in charge. Not because they had
confidence in his abilities, but because
he was too expensive to dismiss. On a
£6 million/year salary, the Italian would
cost the FA £10 million to sack. By
comparison, the French Football Feder-
ation pays Blanc around £900,000/year.
For the record, Barack Obama earns
circa £250,000/year – who do you think
represents the best value for money?
It is incredulous that the FA are foolish
enough to think they can win a trophy
by throwing money at an Italian who can
barely speak English, has a strained rela-
tionship with the players, and has done
little to rejuvenate a stale team since tak-
ing over from Steve McLaren. Capello’s
club record aside, he has no internation-
al pedigree and has failed to instill any
freshness into the squad.
Managers aside, football teams can-
not win big trophies without the best
goalkeepers. Or to paraphrase Jose
Mourinho, you cannot make the best
omelettes without the best eggs. Spain,
the current World Champions, boast
two of the world’s finest keepers – one
who plays for Real Madrid, the other for
Barcelona. England have a dearth of de-
cent goalies, and the first-choice keepers
for the top three Premier League teams
are not English. The same applies with
strikers. England can only boast Wayne
Rooney, who failed to score at the World
Cup. Crouch, Defoe, and C. Cole are
not world class – they lack, forgive the
expression, the X factor. They are per-
ennial underachievers, the footballing
equivalent of Tim Henman.
The team will remain unchanged right
up until the end of Euro 2012. Whether
this continuity will bring them closer
together and improve performances, or
just prolong the inevitable string of sub-
standard results remains to be seen. One
thing is for certain – in the short term,
the fans will continue to boo, much to
Wayne Rooney’s pathetic chagrin.
So much for the “The Audacity of
Hope”, it is all rather more “The Delu-
sion of Hope.”
Three lambs on the shirt
“England fans
are as deluded
as the Apprentice
candidates”
“Here’s the thing;
videogames are cool
now.”
Don’t be a James
Blunt...
Geekiness goes beyond gaming Anyone can claim to have saved
the world. I stopped the toast
from going that little bit too
brown this morning. I don’t
know it yet, but this could have
saved the world.
James Blunt has claimed that
he stopped World War III from
happening. Single handedly, on
his own, and with no other input.
Somehow I doubt that the Brit-
ish high command would have
delegated the whole decision
of attacking Russian troops in
the Balkans to a warbling and
arrogant crooner. If they did,
then this makes me feel for the
quality of our beloved armed
forces. If every captain in the
army was going to get a little bit
too cocksure on patrol and re-
lease something into the world
comparable to fingernails being
dragged down a blackboard,
then I’m surprised there aren’t
more deserters. ‘Beautiful’ be-
ing played at full pitch as I try
to keep the peace is more likely
to make me scream in anguish
and turn the gun on myself
rather than shoot any Russian
troops. So maybe he has a very
tentative point. As tentative a
point as a hooker has a choice
about positions. An input, but
no real claim.
Imagine that Aqua come out
and claim they made David
Cameron the annoying prat, but
nonetheless prime minister,
that he is today. It’s not that ab-
surd a claim compared to World
War III kicking off to the sound
of Back to Bedlam. Maybe the
twee and trashy 90s Europop
caused David to be the man he
is today. Somehow I doubt it.
It reminds me of ridiculous
claims in the acceptance
speeches of arseholes that
masquerade as actors. There’s
never enough use and execu-
tion of the word understated. If
the world of celebrity was a lit-
tle bit more David Mitchell than
Bez from the Happy Mondays,
the world would be free of peo-
ple like me face–palming at eve-
ry corner. Not only is the image
of repetitive face–palming comi-
cal, it’s also resolutely annoying
to the person concerned.
So James, if we are to believe
a man who once sung to a pup-
pet because he lost his triangle
and missed its hypotenuse, ob-
viously a code name for ‘a hell
of a lot of dope’, and that you
did in fact save the world, then
thank you. Thank you so much
James. Rob Cleaver
