il Scott-Heron has en-
tered the musical con-
sciousness of 2010 with
the release of his come-
back LP ‘I’m new here’.
He entered mine as a young boy of 10
years when my parents played his re-
cords on that beloved turntable that span
at 33rpm.
Later on I would discover that not
many artists can match the bohemian ex-
istence, intrigue and poignancy of Gil’s
life: a torch-bearer in the spoken word
movement; a prominent student activist
in the American civil rights movement;
late night jazz romps with the infamous
amnesia express, and; wordsmith behind
the iconic ‘the revolution will not be
televised’, a list whilst impressive still
only offers a mere smattering of the tri-
als and tribulations of Gil Scott-Heron.
We now turn 11 years on from my
fledgling musical recollections to Brix-
ton Academy on a sombre, misty and
cold evening in South West London, an
evening that encompasses not just a gig
but a reincarnation of sorts. ‘I’m new
here’ is somewhat complicated by the
protagonist’s personal history, 16 years
since the last pensive and dark LP enti-
tled ‘Spirits’, a period in which Gil went
AWOL, reappeared and disappeared
once again before being imprisoned for
drug possession. For followers of Gil,
these 16 years remained a colourful time
if not a prolific period of creativity, with
countless cancelled live outings and no-
shows; Gil always seems to keep every-
one on their toes.
This evening, thankfully Gil is pres-
A sublime evening
with Gil Scott-Heron
Gil Scott-Heron gets the blues with Tytus Murphy, on a gloomy
Sunday in The Brixton Academy
ent and correct, arriving to a stage laid
bare with minimal arrangements and a
rapturous welcome from an eclectic de-
mographic of eagerly-awaiting partici-
pants; greeting the crowd affectionately
with light-hearted and hilarious mus-
ings, remarking warmheartedly that he
was ‘no stick in the mud’ aiming to look
‘intellectually involved’ in the spoken
word, but simply that the crowd had col-
lective responsibility to enjoy ourselves,
as he was sure to do.
As in voice, Gil Scott-Heron is strik-
ing in appearance: a wise head sits com-
mandingly on a lanky frame, a gentle
smile that exposes battered and decayed
teeth, brown pants pulled high, pale yel-
low and broad padded jacket draping
low and a grey scruffy fisherman’s hat
enclosing the tips of an illustrious sil-
ver-tinged beard. Despite his frame and
now entering his 62nd year, Gil moves
nimbly around the stage, alternating be-
tween keyboard and circular strolls of
the stage, feeding of the hypnotic jazz
enthused percussion, sax and harmonica
of his slick and tight backing band.
Gil begins his set by remarking wryly
that for those in the crowd who thought
he could not play the piano, ‘you were
right’, much to the amusement of the
enthusiastic and attentive crowd. He
then talks poetically about the battle of
the seasons before subtly morphing into
the melancholy ‘Winter in America’.
Only the bluesy lament of ‘I’ll take care
of you’ features from ‘I’m new here’, a
track in keeping with the atmosphere
of the evening, where Gil ranged from
screaming with anguish, as during

‘The revolution will not be televised. The thing that’s going to change
people, is something that nobody will ever be able to capture on film’
‘Work for Peace’where he cried through
his throaty baritone ‘I don’t want hurt
nobody’ to peacefully conveying ‘Your
daddy loves you’ in a gentle reverb.
Seemingly transfixed during the saxo-
phonist’s regular elegant interjections,
Gil slowly rocked back on his keyboard
stool; head, beard and fisherman’s hat
swaying in the smoke. He is a blues pur-
ist, obsessed with Coltrane et al. and his
evident appreciation of his band’s con-
tributions reveals a youthful love of mu-
sic that still burns brightly. Gil’s voice
is coarse in moments, grainy and harsh,
a far cry from the lush, soulful and dis-
tinctive voice of the 70s but it does not
cause you to wince or flinch; instead
this broken voice adds depth and pain to
the cry of ‘to turn your sick soul inside
out, so that the world can watch you die’
making for an emotionally intense expe-
rience.
The evening is not solely about the
longing, hurt and loss embodied in the
blues but instead a musical journey tra-
versing jazz, African rhythms and soul
with Gil contrasting the rawness of
his singing to jovial commentaries in
between songs, making for an absorb-
ing and enjoyable gig. Culminating in
arguably his magnus opus ‘the bottle’,
which breaks this evening for a 10 min-
ute congo drum solo of epic propor-
tions, Gil rounds off a career-spanning
set to a dedicated crowd who sincerely
hope that it will not be another 16 years
before we see Gil Scott-Heron in the
flesh again, for Mr Scott-Heron did
promise to bring better weather with
him next time.

This California four-piece hail from a
beach town in Southern California, and
sound exactly like you’d expect them
to. The single’s a laid-back, reggae-
tinged acoustic stoner rock number,
designed for sprawling in the sand
and chilling out to – Hell, it even fea-
tures the obligatory bongo drums. Of
course, this means your take on it on
a dank, grey November evening in the
pissing rain, is going to proceed rough-
ly in line with the vividness of your
imagination. It’s a pleasant enough
track – if you like your Jack Johnson
or maybe even your Smash Mouth
there’s plenty here to like, but none of
them are going to be losing sleep over
the competition.

This debut album, from the depths of
the South London ghetto (okay, middle-
class Plumstead in Greenwich) starts
well, but trails off far too rapidly into
a succession of family-friendly pop-
songs with just enough ‘thug life’ ref-
erences to keep the rebellious 15-year-
old target demographic interested. The
first couple of tracks are pretty prom-
ising – dark, bassy numbers that you
could play in a club without any imme-
diate shame. After that, though, the “let
me tell you about my designer things”
stereotypes begin, and the desperation
to seem ‘street’ becomes palpable. In
the end, there’s a genuine talent in there
and the guy can rap, but toeing the fine
line between mainstream Capital Ra-
dio respectability without degenerating
into a kind of bass-driven audio beige
was always going to be difficult, and
this doesn’t manage it. It sounds ex-
actly like what it is – hip-hop lite, or
maybe pop-hop. The kids will love it,
but you and I are probably too old for
this shit.

★★★✩✩
Sounding like Fleet Foxes, Grizzly
Bear and Arcade Fire in a blender,
their sound is extremely of the moment.
Vocal harmonies and string arrange-
ments pushed to the foreground, results
in occasional fantastic moments, but it
never really hits its stride. It’s pleasant
enough, but feels ultimately forgettable.
