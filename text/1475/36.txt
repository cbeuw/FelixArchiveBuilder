T
he welfare state is for like
pe0ple wh0 are like well p00r
and shit 0r are havin a baby but
they are n0t sh0uld have a baby
because they are stupid and will
probably do kill the baby from dr0ppin it
0n the fl00r. The welfare state als0 gives
m0ney to pe0ple who are cann0t walk 0r
can n0t d0 g0 t0ilet but y0u can n0t say
anything bad ab0ut them because that is
racist and blasphem0us. S0 we are 0k
with giving the m0ney t0 int0 the disa-
bleds but n0t the lazy p00r pe0ple. if y0u
d0 n0t have a j0b then y0u can always
be a pr0stitute 0r sell drugs 0r traffick
w0men s0 there is n0 excuse f0r being
n0t having a j0b because there are m0re
j0bs than there are pe0ple. The Welfare
State is paid f0r by the queen

THE WELFARE STATE
May I C**Tinue?
W
hen people tell me
that I’m not al-
lowed to use the
‘C word’, the ‘C
bomb’ or the ‘C
beebie’, I feel indignant. Not just be-
cause they’ve threatened my freedom of
speech, but because they can’t even say
the word ‘cunt’. Now I’m not saying
that the vulgarity should just be thrown
around willy cunting nilly, but it should
at least be recognised and valued for its
unrivalled power to shock. Some of
you may have already turned the page
by now with a grimace of protest, but in
my eyes you’re not principled or high-
minded, you’re simply weak. If you so
vehemently object to an offensive word
because it offends, then you might as
well object to your own lungs when
they manage to successfully supply your
blood with oxygen! The word is just do-
ing its job.
Obscenities, profanities and vulgari-
ties have been used in written language
for centuries. Shakespeare was a no-
torious potty mouth and much of his
work was censored for the sake of them
youngsters. Even Chaucer supposedly
used an early form of the word ‘cunt’
in ‘The Miller’s Tale’. The question is
why such historic writers felt the need to
use foul language. The simple answer is
to push buttons. Shakespeare wanted to
enrage and incense his audience
and Chaucer was just a filthy
pervert who also happened
to be a very tal- ented poet.
I’m not equat-
ing myself to these
literary masters, but I also like to push
buttons. I will never use a ‘nasty word’
unless I deem it absolutely necessary.
The word ‘cunt’ has nearly exactly the
same meaning as ‘twat’, ‘fanny’ and
‘vulva’, but calling someone a vulva
doesn’t seem to pack the same punch.
No, despite the words meaning the same
thing, the word ‘cunt’ sounds offensive
just because, well, it sounds offensive.
The psychology behind our emotional
responses to vulgarities is surprisingly
complicated and there are countless pa-
pers written on the subject. I don’t have
the page space to go into detail, but just
take a moment to ask yourself why you
find the word ‘cunt’ so utterly deplor-
able. If someone called you a vulva,
would you have the same response?
Swearing is a vital linguistic ele-
ment in both spoken and written word,
but more importantly humour. If you
haven’t worked it out by now, I have
very strong opinions on the subject mat-
ter and this is the first time I’ve really
been that serious about something in
Felix. If I want to use the word ‘cunt’,
it’s because I want to offend said ‘cunt’.
If I wanted to call said ‘cunt’ a ‘twat’, a
‘douche’, or an ‘asshole’, I would have
used ‘twat’, ‘douche’ or ‘asshole’. If
readers want to complain about the use
of the word ‘cunt’ then let them com-
plain. Or just star out the ‘u’. And the
‘n’ as well if you want. Starring out let-
ters is like giving Imperial students a
puzzle and they love puzzles! In fact it’s
like playing hangman.
If Shakespeare was allowed to swear, then why not
Hangman? Actually, don’t answer that...
Oi, oi! I’m
talking to you,
there’s nothing
