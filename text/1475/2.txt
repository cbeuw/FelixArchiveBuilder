Lolcat of teh week
Union Notice
President’s Surgery
To be accessible and accountable to students,
Alex Kendall, the Union President, will hold weekly
surgeries where you can come and ask or talk
about anything, from academic or welfare issues
to questions about the bars, nightclub, clubs &
societies or upcoming elections and Union politics.
The next one is being held in the Student Hub,
which is located on Floor 2M in the Union Building.
He likes questions, apparently. So ask away.
