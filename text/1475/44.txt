Eagles
soar to
stunning
first
victory
The Imperial College Handball Club got their sea-
son underway with a convincing victory over local
rivals UCL last Saturday.
Both teams have met previously and although
the Eagles were victorious in every one of these
encounters, be it on the court or in the pub, there
was no room for complacency this time around,
since the intelligence gathered on the opponents
revealed that their team improved substantially
from last year.
After the England Handball Association made
some ridiculous decisions with regards to the re-
structuring of the Development League South,
which left both teams involved in this game in a
group with the 2nd teams of the British Champions
and another well established first division squad,
this game was likely to be the most evenly matched
and interesting of the season and a good indicator
as to how well Imperial was doing in comparison to
other Universities.
Both teams met for an unpleasantly early throw-

insulated sports halls in the UK in its picturesque

mouth side at Harlington. The team knew that a win
was imperitive following their disappointing loss
against Reading last week. It is imperitive that Im-
perial remain unbeaten throughout the remainder of
the season if they are to gain promotion over their
closest rivals, last weeks victors, Reading.
The game started poorly for Imperial who went
a try behind within the first five minutes however,
the team showed good spirit and determination, go-
ing into half time ahead thanks to two tries from
Ben Adubi who is proving to be great addition to
the midfield with his powerful and hard running.
The team were encouraged by the words of coach
Richard Birkett and injured captain Caolan Cotter
and went out into the second half determined to put
a decent performance and an impressive score on
the visitors.
The team showed a good level of togetherness
throughout the second half and despite going into
