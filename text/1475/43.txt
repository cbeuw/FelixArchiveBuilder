Immortals secure their
maiden victory
George Barnes
After last weeks thrilling opening game
the Imperial Immortals knew that their
first win wasn’t far off and they duly de-
livered the first victory in team history
with a convincing win over the Royal
Holloway Bears. It was a marked con-
trast to last season’s meeting when the
Bears left Imperial with a 28-0 win and
shows how far the Immortals have come
in a short space of time.
Imperial had impressive away sup-
port thanks to their cheerleading squad
making the journey to Egham and after
an immaculately observed minutes si-
lence in honour of Remembrance Sun-
day, the Immortals won the toss and de-
cided to kick-off. This opening kick-off
set the tone for the game as the Bears
returner fumbled the ball and Immor-
tals viper Dexter Valencia recovered,
giving the Immortals offence good
field position inside the Bears half. A
false start and an early sack conceded
stopped the offence capitalising, but
the defence stepped up and forced the
Bears to a three-and-out.
Having shaken off the earlier drive,
the offence set to the task in hand and an
excellent drive led to a go-ahead score
for running-back Tino Millar. Rookie
half-back Alistair Boyce set the drive in
motion with an impressive 55 yard run
and a 20 yard reception by tight end Mi-
chael Peacock put the Immortals in the
Bears half of the field. Solid blocking by
the offensive line, led by rookie centre
Jackson Xing, gave Millar the room to
rush for a 24 yard touchdown, his third
of the season. The ensuing 2-point con-
version failed giving the Immortals a
6-0 lead.
Not to be outdone the defence deliv-
ered a takeaway on the Bears next drive
as linebacker Artur Jarzabek forced a
fumble for defensive lineman Quirin
Grossman to recover. The offence once
more took to the field but solid runs by
Millar and quarterback Rob Wolsten-
holme were wiped out by a false start
and a holding penalty, forcing the Im-
mortals to punt. In a hurry to get the ball
back, the defence took advantage of a
fumbled hand-off by the Bears offence
and viper Charles Kennedy pounced to
recover for Imperial.
With good field position, the Immor-
tals handed the ball off to fullback Alex
Karvelas and the veteran carried the ball
2 yards across the goalline for a career
first touchdown. The 2-point conversion
failed and the Immortals now had a 12-0
lead.
The second half saw the Immortals
take control of the game as both their
offensive and defensive lines began
to dominate the tiring Bears linemen,
thanks in no small part to Quirin Gross-
man and Zubin Jehangir. Jehangir burst
through the Holloway offensive line to
sack the quarterback and force a fumble
which was narrowly recovered by the
Bears and Grossman dominated the
line so thoroughly that Holloway went
so far as to change their starting centre.
Jackson Xing, who impressed in his
debut against Surrey, led the offensive
line brilliantly with able support from
Marcus Shepherd, Frederico “Massa”
Sanches and Peter Lipka. Lipka dis-
tinguished himself in particular when
Wolstenholme was intercepted and the
offensive lineman rushed half the length
of the field to make a touchdown-saving
tackle.
The offence moved the ball well, with
Karvelas denied a second touchdown
when his run was called back for a hold-
ing penalty and despite further good run-
ning from Alistair Boyce and a 12 yard
reception by wide receiver Charles Ed-
wards the Immortals were unable to add
to their score. The defence continued
to make plays and were unlucky not to
score themselves when Artur Jarzabek
intercepted a pass on the half-way line
and ran the ball back to the 1. Safety Ar-
jav Trivedi also opened his interception
account with his first pick of the season
and Dexter Valencia added a sack late in
the game.
A stirring first win for the team sees
them move to a 1-1 record. In truth
the Immortals could have and perhaps
should have won by more than a 12
point margin, but with the defence re-
cording it’s first shut-out in club history,
the team is on the up.
The Immortals carried on from their
maiden victory, trained hard and re-
corded their second victory within a
week overcomming the London South
Bank Spartans 20-14 in overtime after
the fulltime score ended 14-14. This al-
lowed the Immortals to move onto a 2-1
record putting them in a good position.
Further London derbies against Brunel
and Kings College are on the schedule
for December and the Immortals will
know that if they can cut out mistakes
they stand a very good chance of main-
taining their winning record into the
new year.
