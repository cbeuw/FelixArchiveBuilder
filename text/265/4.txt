After RCSU's failures to elect a president in a
seemly manner on two out of three occasions in the last
two years, one hopes they will have more success this
time. In particular, let's hope we see no more of the
irregularities in the ballot which marred last summer's
election causing one of the stormiest RCSU meetings for
some time, the eventual withdrawal of the two candi-
dates and the appointment of an acting president to steer
the anion through the summer.
However, despite the recent controversy surrounding
their elections, RCSU has, in principle, by far a more
democratic election procedure than has Imperial College
Union. At least the former do hold a ballot of the whole
union with ample opportunity for everyone to cast a vote.
The election of the ICU president and secretary at a joint
meeting of Council (a conglomeration of the retiring and
incoming council members) is merely a convenient means
of disenfranchising the bulk of union members. It is said
that those who are on Council (and one must admit that
council members are elected in the main from the student
body) knew better than anyone else who will or will not
make the best available president, but, to my mind, the
system effectively restricts the choice of president and
secretary to those who have served on council in the past.
This may ensure that all the candidates are experienced in
Union affairs but it can cut out people with fresh ideas
and those in touch with the " grass roots." However,
much more important, now that the ideal of communica-
tion between council and the union floor is being freely
bandied about, why not let .everybody have a say in elect-
ing the two most important officers of the Union as well
as having a say in the policies and activities of it. Last
year, a motion to elect the ICU president from the whole
union narrowly failed to achieve the required majority
for it to become law. I hope that this very desirable
change will soon come about.
Now, having said that everyone should have a vote
in the presidential ballot. I hope as many as possible
pack the concert hall tomorrow to exercise votes they do
have at the ICU meeting. Important questions such as
which charity we should support this year have to be
answered. .Register your opinion tomorrow.
CHARITIES
Ian Williams writes short
profiles of the 4 charities
which are to be nominated
at tomorrow's Union meeting
for selection as I.C's Carnival
charity this year.
Unmarried Mothers
If the National Council is
allowed to collapse, the situ-
ation for unmarried mothers
will become even worse.
They will have lost an active
welfare organisation to turn
to in need and a militant
pressure group that fights
for their rights. Until we
live in a society in which
everyone is so educated
and responsible that there
are no unwanted children, it
is essential that the work of
the fifty-year-old National
Council should continue.
One in thirteen of all
children born in England
and Wales is illegitimate,
and one out of six unmar-
ried mothers goes into a
Mother and Baby home to
have her child, afraid of the
hostility and intolerance she
is likely to meet in the out-
side world. The National
Council for the Unmarried
Mother and her Child
makes these facts known to
the public by its work, and
recently announced that un-
less £12,000 is produced
immediately it will have to
close down.
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple (Disseminated)
Sclerosis is a progressm,
degenerative disease, caus-
ing paralysis and pain
generally throughout the
body, by damaging the
central nervous system, in
Unpredictable stages. Either
alone, or in combination
with various intercurrent in-
fection, the results are ulti-
mately fatal.
About 1 in 1100 persons
in this country will, by pre-
sent statistical evidence, be-
come victims of this dis-
ease. The number of
deaths, each year in Great
Britain, caused by Multiple
Sclerosis and its complica-
tions is more than 1500.
Mainly, the disease affects
younger people between
mid-teens and 45 years of
age, tragically interfering
with a person's ability to
carry on working, to pro-
vide for hfs or herself or
dependants. Owing to the
lack of knowledge relating
to its mysterious patholo-
logical mechanisms, there
is nO specific alleviation
with means to halt, or to re*
tard the advance of the
disease.
The work of the Multiple
Sclerosis Research Fund
Ltd. is in the financing and
extension of Medical Re-
search on the disease.

R.C.S.U. Freshers Tea
We would like to express
our concern at the parts we
played in the fiasco which,
went under the name of
RCS Freshers' Tea. We
also condemn the organisers
for their lack of foresight in
allowing it to proceed as it
did.
The organisation was to-
tally uncoordinated : many
freshers were unaware of
the time and place; and
When they arrived there was
nothing prepared for them,
few chairs, no teas and no
union officials.
The accepted purpose of
the Freshers' Tea is to intro-
duce the Union. It would
therefore be infinitely pre-
ferable if all committee
members attended and ade-
quate guidelines for the tone
of the affair were laid down,
so that a balanced and co-
herent picture of the union's
functions could be gained.
A second year girl not only
found it extremely emba-
rassing, but also said, " . . .
Most fresher girls who have
seen that fiasco will never
want to have anything to do
with R.C.S. again!"
Perhaps in the future the
following ideas could be
considered; the appointment
of a capable organiser; the
consideration of likely fe-
male reactions; and sensible
timing to avoid clashing with
refectory hours.
We sincerely hope that
during the rest of the year
the union will make a
definite effort to reverse this
initial disastrous impression.

STEAR, A.BROOKS
For space reasons, this letter
has been edited.
Dear Sir,
The letter of complaint
concerning the R.C.S.U.
Freshers' Tea, states that
some of the people present
were embarrassed by the
sketches presented. If this
was so, then I apologise to
them.
Since the tea, the Union
General Committee dis-
cussed the format of the
event, and proposals by
that Committee have been
presented for discussion be-
fore a Union Meeting.
I would point out to the
signatories of the letter that
a Union Meeting is in fact
the best place to air their
views. Debate via this col-
umn is technically difficult
to pursue to any conclusion
and Felix reporters are cap-
able of supplying any criti-
cal assessment of college
events that is necessary.
J. J. WARREN,
Acting President, R.C.S.U.
Wellsoc
Dear Sir,
The first meeting of the
H. G. Wells Society on
October 7th, was, I feel, an
unqualified success both for
Sir Barnes Wallis and the
Society.
The evening was only
marred by our inability to
accommodate everyone—a
fact which I personally and
the Committee deeply re-
pret. It is on their behalf,
therefore, that I want to ex-
tend our sincere apologies
— particularly to those
paid-up members who were
turned away. In the past
we have used closed-circuit
T.V. to extend the first lec-
ture to just a few more, but
this year none was avail-
able and we were limited by
the capacity of the lecture
theatre.
We hope this will not re-
cur but in case it does, I
would urge members and
non-members alike to ar-
rive before 7.15 p.m., this
being the only way to en-
sure a seat.
With thanks to all those
who comprised a most re-
sponsive audience.
.Yours sincerely,
JOHN C. SPENCE.
Chairman Wellsoc.
Shelter
Shelter is a rescue opera-
tion for Britain's homeless
families. It is a movement
of people all over the coun-
try who are facing up to the
reality of an emergency situ-
ation and the reality is that
our housing problem will
not be overcome for at least
ten years. Protests will not
alter that, but involvement
can.
A representative com-
mittee distributes the money
raised by Shelter to highly
efficient voluntary housing
associations working in our
worst hit housing areas.
These non-profit making
groups buy houses, improve
them, convert them into
good, simple homes and let
them at rents that those in
most urgent need can afford.
Housing associations can
borrow between five and
eight times the gift money
that shelter raises and save
a large, and precious, part
of the existing housing
stock. Gift money is essen-
tial, for the borrowed capi-
tal is repayed from rents:
the more1
you borrow, the
higher the rents and, if you
borrow 100 per cent, then
the rents you need to charge
cannot be paid by the most
desperate families.
Shelter can bring homes
and happiness to thousands
of families at present strug-
gling against disintegration
and breakup, in appalling
slums.
World Wildlife Fund
The World Wildlife Fund
is an international charit-
able foundation devoted to
the concept that conserva-
tion is for the benefit of
man. At one end of its
scale of activities it is try-
ing to save certain animal
and plant species from ex-
tinction ; at the other end
it extends over the whole in-
tricate relationship between
water, soil, plants, animals
and man himself—the eco-
logical web.
The object of the WWF
is to keep alive as many as
possible of the different
kinds of birds, beasts and
plants which have hitherto
shared this planet with us.
In this context "wildlife"
includes anything which is
alive and wild and the aim
of the WWF is to perpet-
uate, for the enjoyment of
people, as much as possible
of the natural world, which
is an essential part of our
human invironment. If
this object fails, many
species will become extinct
ks a direct result of man's
activities; many unique
wild places will disappear
for ever.
If the WWF is selected
for I.C. Carnival Charity
this year, the money col-
lected will go to help pur-
chase an island in the Sey-
chelles. This island would
be used as a research sta-
tion investigating various
phenomena affecting man
and his environment It is
hoped that the Biological
Departments of I.C. could
participate in this Research
Station.
Mealy Hypocrite?
Sir,
Just what does RCS Vice-
President Javad "Adolf"
Hashteroudian reckon he
got for his £35 10s. 0d.?
What does he think he has
achieved? What does Felix
intend by making the whole
pointless affair front page
news?
There has recently been
a disaster in Persia, perhaps
we could hear about Mr.
Hashteroudian's work to al-
leviate the resulting suffering
there.
You say in your editorial
that you can't help thinking
that the social service OSS
undertakes does more im-
mediate good than a score
of demonstrations on Viet-
nam. Why then headlines
for Hashteroudian and page
8 for OSS in thefirst(Fresh-
man) issue of Felix this
year?
Won't the freshmen think
that you are a mealy
mouthed hypocrite editing
an irresponsible rag?
