BARNES WALLIS:
THE STRENGTH OF ENGLAND
Wells Soc.'s first Meeting was packed, and one of the
authors of this articie, arriving at the last minute, only just
managed to get in. At least a hundred and fifty were
turned away when the lecture theatre became full.
Lively and Witty
Lord Jackson of Burnley, Wells Soc.'s new President,
introduced the Speaker, Sir Barnes Wallis CBE, as having
a " fire in his belly and a furnace in his head " and Sir
Barnes proceeded to demonstrate this with a lively and
amusing lecture. Looking a sprightly 60, which belied his
tally of 81 years, he made his lecture technically straight-
forward but always spieed with inventiveness and wit, the
former consolidating his reputation and the latter to the
delight of his audience. His subject was " The Strength
of Eneland."

FRESHERS' HOP
S e a
Power
Sir Barnes started by de-
monstrating that most an-
cient civilisations owed their
rise to the development of
sea transported their pros-
perity to their possessing a
shoreline. He made the
point that wealth was de-
pendent on trade which in
turn was dependent on
tea transport, the cheapest
r and most convenient form
both now and in the past.
He then showed that Britain,
with her 2,500 miles of well-
developed coast, was effec-
tively in the centre of mo-
dern civilisation and even
surpassed the Soviet Union
<n trading convenience.
Nautilus
To Sir Barnes, therefore,
the obvious way for Bri-
tain to once more rule the
waves is to travel beneath
them. He has in mind
the legendary North West
passage which, he believes,
was found by the atomic
sub. " Nautilus" when it
went through the Bering
Straights and under the
North Pole. He proposes
an enormous cargo sub-
marine which can travel
half way round the world at
a depth of over 5,000 feet.
Y6u can forget about nu-
clear power too—his vessel
carries liquid oxygen, liquid
carbon dioxide and a methy-
lene-based fuel which leaves
you with a tank full of C O ,
at the end of your voyage
which you " sell to M r .
Walls at 4s. a pound thereby
recovering the cost of your
entire trip!"
Air Power
The second half of the
lecture was concerned with
the problem of restoring
Britain's air supremacy.
Answer: build a craft
capable of reaching speeds
of Mach 7 or 8 which would
enable it to fly half-way
round the w rid without re-
fuelling. With the aid of a
film and some lucid dia-
grams, Sir Barnes showed
that the approach to this
problem is through the de-
velopment of his famous
" Swing-Wing " concept.
Swing Wing
The sad story of the Go-
vernment's short-sight and
the Americans' subsequent
cornering of his idea is- well
known, but Sir Barnes
offered some consolation by
marvelling at the Ameri-
cans' ineptitude in trying to
make swing-Wing work "for
lack of a single steel strut."!
Fable
He finished his lecture
with a poetic quotation
about a knight who, wound-
ed by the sword, lay and
" bled awhile " only to rise
revitalised ' and conq er
anew. One wasn't sure
whether he referred to Eng-
land or himself — either
would have been appropri-
ate. One has a sneaking
suspicion, however, that
while England may ascend
without Barnes Wallis—
Barnes Wallis will never as-
cend without England!

I. N . Q U A R R I N T O N
The Freshers' Hop turned
out to be for most people a
peaceful and enjoyable
event. The attendance was
put at oyer 900, of which
only a minute proportion, or
so it seemed, were of the
fairer sex. The noise to
which the Union building
walls and some of the people
shook was provided by three
groups: the Sweet from
Edmonton, the Bananas
from Coventry and the Colts
from Barking. There was
no general agreement as to
which group was the best.
Perhaps of interest, though,
was the fact that this was
the first professional en-
gagement of the Sweet, who
in the near future are to
record an L.P. and single
for release in the USA and
Germany.
For the freshers, the hop
came at the end of their hec-
tic first week. Most of the
males arrived hoping to get
their hands on one of the
rare birds. As the available
talent was quickly booked
most turned their energy
from stalking the prey to
pushing through the crush
to the bar. Over the odd
pint many decided to seek
more lucrative pastures the
following week; who can
blame them? As for the fe-
male freshers, all I can say
is : You lucky lot.

We'll help you
The best thing any Freshman can do with
his first grant cheque is take it into the
nearest branch of Westminster Bank and
open a current account.
For one thing, other people are going to want
to pay you money in the future. Most of them
will pay by cheque—and this will go on being an
embarrassment until the day when you finally
open an account.
Much more important, a cheque-book is still
the easiest way of paying out money. You no
longer have to carry a lot of loose cash in your
pocket which can get lost or squandered away
on trifles. Instead, your cash stays where it
belongs, safe in the Bank—and the cheque-book
in your pocket still lets you buy what you want,
when you want. Afterwards your Bank state-
ment tells you where the money went; and this
too helps you to save.
It makes you feel taller
Later, your Westminster Manager will be able
to give you advice on how to make those savings
grow. He will become a trusted friend (this is not
flannel; he will) who can give you practical help
at the times when you need it most-during your
years at University, and throughout your life.
Besides these (and other) practical advantages
a Westminster cheque-book gives you some-
thing just as important: status. It proves that
you are an established adult in your own right.
This can be a very considerable asset.
