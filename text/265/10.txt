The I.C. sporting scene got off to a reasonably smooth
start last week to the accompaniment of much rairt, mud,
injuries, and markedly better-cooked meals at IlarlingtOiJ.
The smaller clubs are recruiting like mad, but. as yet,
have had few matches to write about.
The larger clubs all had a full fixture list but. due
to the weather, and hence ground conditions, the Hockey
Club have yet to play-
There was an incredible scene at Harlington on
Saturday. A soccer player with a dislocated knee had to
be ousted from his stritcher so lhat an injured player
could be accommodated In all, five people went to hos-
pital with concussion; a broken rib; ft cracked wrist; the
dislocated knee, and a broken collar bone- One trusts that
this is not to bq the weekly average!
The R.C.C. minibus can now be booked hy all I.C.
•clubs; booking terras are available in the Union Office.
BADMINTON
Imperial College has one of the strongest badminton
clubs in the London University League, and accordingly
has bad many successful seasons in the past. The club runs
5 teams—3 mens, 1 mixed and 1 ladies. Matches against
other London Colleges are played on Wednesday after-
noons and Saturdays; Liendlies are also arranged with
Oftbrd, Cambridge and Brighton.
IC A F C Trials
The club plays at nine
Elms Baths, Battersea,
where two courts are hired
regularly. Play also takes
place in the Union Gym-
nasium on Wednesday after-
noons and Saturday and
Sunday mornings. This
year's trials will be starting
this week and any players
who are interested in play-
ing are asked to contact the
Captain Or Secretary c/o the
'Union rack.
Towards the end of the
season a singles champion-
ship is held and the winner
has his name suitably in-
scribed on a tankard in the
Union Bar! Prospects for
the club this season seem
very good as a large num-
ber of freshers have shown
interest; their support is
most important to the con-
tinued success of the club.

Imperial College Women'*
Sports Club, known as
ICW(I)SC funs athletics
badminton, hockey, netball,
squash, swimming, table
tennis and tennis teams. Al-
though all the captains have
not yet had their trials we
seem to be heading for an-
other promising year.
The netball team is in the
University of London Union
1st league and with a little
more support may avoid re-
legation this season. The
hockey team has much to
live up to having won the
U.L.U. Gifford Cup and the
U.L.U. American tourna-
ment. We also joined with
the men's club, to win the
mixed hockey tournament.
Mixed hockey; a very social
game, is played on Sundays
and people wishing to play
should sign the notice placed
conveniently near the Union
Bar.
This year with the new
pool we hope to get a swim-
ming team off the ground
and despite the squash
courts not yet being ready
we hope the team will again
have a measure of success
as the only ladies team in
the league.
I.C.W.S.C. also has a
keep fit class every Monday
from 6.30 to 7.00 in the gym
which any Icwarian can at-
tend.
If you want more infor-
mation or wish to join a
team contact Joyce Butcher,
President, via the Union
Rack.

This could be a success-
ful year for the team. The
influx of fresher enthusiasm
has encouraged even some
of the " old lags" to train,
often at ungodly hours and
places.
The 1st U.L. Trial was
our initial competition and
we fared well. Many of us
were delighted to see (etc.)
the Hampstead mud in ex-
cellent condition so early
on in the season.
On the following day
(Sunday) we trained at Bor-
der A.C. near Haslemere,
Surrey, under the expert
guidance of Bill Sykes, who
allowed some of us to dis-
cover that orienteering is a
subject I.C. doesn't ade-
quatelycater for. The session
closed with a shattering re-
lay. Plans regarding orien-
teering are germinating in
fertile minds.
By publication, we will
have run in the U.C. 6 x 2
mile relay, and also trained *
in Richmond Park,
ULU Trial
Next Saturday, October
19th, sees the 2nd U.L.
Trial, which is also the 1st
London League match. We
aim to have at least 4
teams competing in this
throughout the season, so
all are welcome, especially
freshers—who knows, you
could make the U.L. or per-
haps even the IC. Team !
If you are interested in
training with us, come to
the Gym at 12.30 on Tues-
days or Thursdays.

, The Eton Fives Club is
one of the newest of the
I.C. athletic clubs, and is in
fact the only E.F. club in
London University. The
club has a useful nucleus
of keen players and with a
few freshers the team could
improve considerably. We
are hoping that the coming
year will prove our most
successful yet. The club
plays about a dozen
matches spread out Over
the first two terms. We
practise most Friday even-
ings usually at Westminster
School courts. In addition
other evenings can probably
be arranged, if there is suffi-
cient demand. In previous
years pairs have been en-
tered in the Kinniard Cup«
at Eton and the Midland
Tournament in Birming-
ham, and we hope to do the
same this year.
We try to make the club
as much a social as an
athletic club, most evenings
ending at the local. Players
of all standards are wel-
come to come along.

After a good opening
burst, I.C. put in an inept
performance at Harlington
OR Saturday. Half-time
saw the score 6-0 to I.C,.
Pine having kicked two
penalties. From then on.
fighting into the wind and
and with the sun in their
eyes, I.C.'s play deteriorated
leaving large gaps in a
strained defence. Reading
deservedly scored a goal, a
try and a penalty during
this half and only a very
sound display by Wilde at
fullback, and devastatingly
display tackling by Chap-
pell kept the score down.
I.C. jump high for the baft
GOLF SCENE
Last year the " Tigers "
in the Golf Club succeeded
in pulling off some notable
victories, the most import-
ant of which was the win-
ning of the ULU Golf Cham-
pionships with a winning fj-
round total of 462 shots.
The team's performance in
Inter-Collegiate matches was
not so good, last year's re-
sults being the poorest for
several years, but with a
good influx of Freshmen we
hope to do considerably
better this year.
This year sees the forma-
tion of a new Golf League
to which all the top golfing
Colleges in the South East
are affiliated; this league
offers a good opportunity
for IC since our best team
would consist of six men
with singlefigurehandicaps
The ULU Golf Trials were
held at Sandy Lodge G.C.
on Wednesday 9th October.
IC was strongly represented
and at least three members
were selected for one of the
University's two teams.
