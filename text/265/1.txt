IAN JARVIS
for CARNIVAL!
At last Thursday's meet-
ing of the Carnival Board
Ian Jarvis was elected Car-
nival Co-ordinator. This
post was left vacant by the
marriage of Anita Furniss
(now Mrs. Long) this sum-
mer.
Ian Jarvis was Mech
Eng. 1 " sports" rep last
year and organised collec-
tions for Carnival totalling
more than £600. For this
work he was awarded a
C&G Union General award.
Last year, too, he was the
unsuccessful Vice-Presi-
dential candidate in Guilds.
He regards Carnival
mainly as a means of peo-
ple enjoying themselves and
not as an organisation for
extorting money out of the
public. He is quite pre-
pared to collect less money
than last year if people get
more enjoyment out of it.
He does not want however
to be associated with stunts
that offer little financial w
turn. Incentives #hich are
Used to create* interdepart-
mental rivalry should come
from firms, like-the prizes
for the raffle, and not from
the collections as this is the
same as embezzlement.
He is istill forming ideas
about Carnival activities,
but it is quite definite that
there will be no football
pools this year as it Only
made £200 last year. Car-
nival week is going to be a
big thing this year and as a
concession to commercial-
ism there will be an Albert
Hall concert. Rumour has
it that he may soon be mak-
ing enquiries about a cer-
tain American duo.
IAESTE
The International Association for the Exchange of
Students for Technical Experience (I.A.E.S.T.E.) last year
provided jobs abroad for 84 people from this College
is 21 different countries ranging from Ireland to Japan.
However the number that applied for such work was 271.
The difference in these odds of 3 to 1 against him
fees to
J g o u p
two numbers has increased
over previous years due to
fewer places being available
in Britain for Foreign stu-
dents to carry out vacation
training work — although
the scheme is not a direct
exchange, it is highly influ-
enced by the number of
places mutually available.
the I.A.E.S.T.E ^nances
/have suffered a loss since
only those placed paid a
pliCfiSttient fee of 30/-, and
this number has dropped
alarmingly. Consequently
I.A.E.S.T.E. propose to
charge every applicant a
registration fee of £1 as
<#ell as a placement fee.
This hardly seems fair,
since at present only about
30 per cent, of students act-
ually obtain any help from
this Association.
I.A.E.S.T.E, is this* TTC
duced to a lottery with the
poor student (betting £1 at
getting a job.
It is to be hoped that
I.AE.S.T.E. change their
proposals or they will in-
evitable lose much support
from colleges throughout
the country.
S Q U A S H
The Squash courts in the
Sports Centre are provision-
ally due to open on Novem-
ber 1st and, during term-
time, will be reserved ex-
clusively for-, use by I.C.
students and their guests.
Members of staff will only
be'allowed to use the courts
during the vacations unless
they are life-members of
I.C.y. It is also hoped to
create a weigh^training
centre there sometime this
term.

UNION
F E E
INCREASE
The Union fees this year
have been increased by two
pounds to six pounds, the
first increase for several
years. Because the Union
fees are part of the College
fee, the increase is levied, in
most cases, direct from the
Local Education Authori-
ties.
Reserve
The increase should bring
in nearly £8000 a year extra
to the Union, which will
help to build Up the. Union's
depleted reserve fund.
However, since the Govern-
ing Body has subsidised the
Union to the tune of £1,100
in 1966-67 and £3.200 in
1967-68 while negotiations
for an increase were in pro-
gress, the full benefit of this
extra £8,000 will not im-
mediately be felt. The debt
to the College will have to
be repaid at the rate of tert
shillings per student per year
until the whole £4,300 has
been paid off. Rex Lowin
expands on the fee increase
in the President's Column
inside.
HUGHES or DOLWIN ?
Anti vote
With last Friday's closing of nominations for the
post of RCS President, two candidates had entered their
names on the nomination lists. The choice for next
Monday's ballot lies between Gwyn Hughes, a little known
third year mathematician, and Peter Dolwin, chain smok-
ing third year physicist who was unsuccessful in last year's
fight for the vice-presidency.
Roots
Hughes may be regarded as the " grass»roots" man
not having been active in RCSU before, but has a strong
interest in staff-student relations, while ori the other hand
Dolwin seems to be the " establishmentcandidate, being
proposed by RCS vice-president Adolph HaShteroudian
and having participated widely in Union affairs in the
past.
The outcome of the election seems to be uncertain..
Dolwin is certainly the better known (though at the time
of writing his publicity campaign was non-existent white
Hughes' was well under way), but he may well inspire, a
large anti-vote which could squeeze Gwyn Hughes in.
