PARKING
SPACE
ALLOCATION
A l l student car parking
spaces for this year have
now been allocated and
several people have been
into the Union office with
queries and complaints
about the fairness of the al-
location.
The method of selection
used was to have 8 people
read through every single
form (the 6 members of the
Exec, plus the Halls Rep on
Council and the Council
Rep on the Parking Com-
mittee) and the committee's
decision is final. Each Com-
mittee member awarded a
mark to each application ac-
cording to the circumstances
of the application (distance
from the tube station, whe-
ther they had to bring their
wives in, etc.) and those with
the highest total of marks
were allocated a parking
space.., Those left over have
been put on a reserve list
and will be given spaces if
vacancies occur.
Apology
In the last issue of
P E L I X it was incorrectly
Stated in the profile of
Jane Pearson that she
toped the pool in the election
of the Floor Reps, when in
fact Vinod Garga did so, and
and FELIX apologises to Jane
and Vinod for this error

NO FUTURE
FOR FRESHERS
Rousing music and a procession, headed by the be-
nign figure, resplendent in whiskers and gown, of " C-
squared ** Parker, Chairman of Debates, heralded the
opening of the Freshers Debating Competition.
Freshmen competed for the " Freshman Debater of the
Year Tankard" which was to be inscribed with the winner's
name and retained for his personal use in the Southside or
Union Bar.
Mike Edwards proposed
the motion that "This
House sees no Future, for
Freshmen," painting a very
gloomy future for freshers.
It consisted of taking endless
exams, filling in numerous
forms and it was cut short
by the bomb.
loving future
Rex Lowin opposed the
motion. His message was
you've never had it so
good " or rather " you've
never had the Union so
good."
The freshmen then took
over. Opinions on the fu-
ture of freshers differed
greatly. Mr. Eden (Maths
I.) was so absorbed with the
present (he had joined 12
societies on Freshers Day)
that he saw no future and
did not wish to.
Mr. Asi Sing Bama, on
the other hand described the
future as " loving, charming
and pleasing." He saw vast
opportunities for scientist-
freshers to improve the
World. So far, he said,
Science had produced
bombs and starvation.
freshers are out
A n extremely witty speech
for the motion was given by
Penny Clark. She began by
stating that this year, fresh-
ers were definitely out and
she pointed out that Horn-
sey had given them up. She
went on to predict the fates
of this year's freshers. These
ranged from falling off
mountains to getting thrown
out of hall or digs and hav-
ing to walk the embank-
ment. To the relief of the
participants Miss Clark did
not qualify for the tankard,
as she was not a fresher.
A speech which, although
not polished enough to win
the Tankard, was much ap-
preciated by the audience,
was that given by N . de
Klerk (Physics I). He ar-
rested the attention of the
house by beginning " Cripes
if this debate doesn't remind
me of an abo's Loin Cloth "
He produced an impressive
list of statistics on the men-
tal health of students, in re-
ply to a point brought up by
a previous speaker. Mr. de
Klerk saw no real difference
between the future and the
past and therefore found the
motion meaningless, calling
on the house to abstain.
Mr. Weightman. (Mining
Geology) gave perhaps the
most entertaining speech, or
should I say ovation. With
hand raised, he proclaimed
that he had come to the
conclusion that C-squared
was God, Mr. Weightman
saw a glowing future for
freshers and gave a warning
to the. older members of the
House; " watch out you old
lags we freshers are.on the
horizon."
joint winners
After 1\ hours the motion
was lost by 52 votes to 18,
with 18 abstentions. The
judges decided to make Mr.
Eden and Mr. Weightman
joint winners and the house
voted that both names
should be inscribed on the
Tankard.
