Where is the University of South Kensington ?
What is a University anyway ?
Why did you come here ?
Many years ago H. G. Wells (who studied at JC)
spoke bluntly about " typical" members of IC—Vision-
less, no sense of social purpose, narrow-minded, insular,
etc- . . . (We've heard it all before, anyhow!)
Neighbouring C o l l e g e s
Many people know they are Philistines but thinking
about it won't help; we need action! Why is IC so.
insular ? Why does not IC integrate with the neighbour-
ing cultural (God help us if they are not!) institutions:
on all four sides R C A (Royal College of Art—600
students); in our midst RCM (Royal College of Music—
500 students); just south L'Institut Francaise (LIF—400
students); and what about Maria Assumpta (MA) and the
College of Estate Management (C.E.M.).
The places are here, the people in them are here;
many people at this degree factory flatter their intellects
by saying they come to IC to hear points of view, meet
people, understand other outlooks on life, etc., etc. Yet
we Temain here alone. The situation is crazy.
Links
We need real links—i.e.
integration of people—at all
Social, cultural, political and
academic levels. This means
far more than a few unpub-
lished paper agreements or
declarations of intent,
reached by parternalistic
committees. We must pub-
licise and involve people ra-
ther than paper.
What has been arranged
so far?
R C A :
Societies
Firstly with RCA :
Clubs RCA students are en-
titled to join any IC clubs
(arranged last term). There
are restrictions on athletic
clubs teams and variations
in membership fees, though.)
An information getting list
(similar to the one given to
'IC freshers)- has been dis-
tributed in RCA—replies
are coming in. IC clubs are
free to publicise in R C A —
and vice versa.
Events Again we are mu-
tually free to publicise—e.g;
Morade from RCA.
General IC Union hand-
books and blue books (.very
useful for club information)
have been distributed in
RCA.
General Studies IC Admini-
stration have agreed to allow
full publicity in RCA.
Refearpry IC students are
free and welcome to use
RCA refectory (do you
know the way?) arranged
last year.
Bar Similarly (similarly?).
Information
Newspapers This FELIX
and all henceforth are on
sale in RCA. RCA News-
letter will be available here.
Magazines Phoenix (IQ and
Ark (RCA) will be mutually
distributed.
Committees IC External
Affairs Committee agrees to
have a permanent observer
from RCA. Exchange is
probable but not finalised.
Coming Events Admin have
agreed to this being circu-
larised in RCA.
Clubs must now consider it
perfectly normal to publi-
cise in RCA (does^your club
do this ?). Students must
consider it natural to eat in
RCA, if convenient (it is
preferable to Mooney, any-
how 1)
Other things are happen-
ing, other ideas are wel-
come. Q T just go there.
What else happens around
IC? Discussions are now
going on with RCM—there
is an eating place there, too.
M A negotiations have been
fruitful—already the num-
ber of MA girls in IC clubs
has increased. Students at
LIF have been approached
similarly (see Late News).
Near IC—of special inte-
rest to people who eat—we
have an excellent restaurant
jn the V'&A (Victoria and
Albert Museum)—contain-
ing many girls from LIF—
and a cafe in the Science
Museum, or there is always
the Queens (ask a physicist).
Also Philistines might find
the contents of the V & A
interesting, or even the other
museums; maybe the Albert
Hall need not be mentioned.
Soon a map will be pro-
duced, a map of the area
round here showing you
where it all happens, what
you are missing, how you
can have a richer and fuller
University Kfe.
Well :•-.

As recently reported in the National Press, the
National Union of Students has held discussions with the
Committee of Vice-ChancellOrs and Principals on the
general subject of student participation in University life.
No Simple Solution
The statement confirmed,
" we have no doubt that the
machinery of student parti-
cipation should be extended
and improved we
would welcome the develop-
ment of joint staff/student
Committees in new and
more effective forms." Stu-
dent participation would de-
pend on the willingness of a
sufficient number of stu-
dents to take part.
Another field the discus-
sions covered was course
content and teaching me-
thods. The statement stres-
sed the the right of the
teacher to decide on the way
in which he presented his
subject. However there
should be opportunities for
the students to have discus-
sions on the courses and
teaching methods.
They issued a joint statement last week on the discus-
sions which covered a wide range of different issues. In
opening they said there was a " widespread commitment
among all members of universities to a concept of the "aca-
demic community," but with changes jn the social situation F x a m i n a f m « «
the role of students within this community should be
"modified and modernised."
The problems of students making their views felt
effectively was not simple, the statement said, as the de-
cision-making structures were generally complex.
The NUS " seeks effective
student presence on all rele-
vant committees." Three
broad areas of operation
were outlined.
(a) student welfare e.g.
health services, catering and
accommodation, where stu-
dents should have some part
in the decision—making;
(b) curriculum and cour-
ses, teaching methods, ma-
jor organisational matters,
and the planning and de-
velopment of the University,
where student views should
be taken into accounts
(c) decisions affecting-the
position of staff, admission
to the University and aca-
demic assessment where stu-
dent presence would be in-
appropriate."
Examinations were the
next subject discussed. -It
was noted that the NUS had
already cast doubt on the
fairness of many examina-
tions. While the universities
did their utmost to maintain
the standards of examina-
tions some new methods
had been introduced, such
as dissertations, projects,
" open-book " examinations
and continuous assessment.
Research was in hand "with
the object of testing the
validity of these devices." It
was "common ground in our
discussions that more re-
1
search and experiment on
the subject of examinations
are required."
Discipline
On discipline the states-
men., said there " should be
provision for specific stu-
dent participation in disci-
plinary procedures, especi-
ally in instances where a
student's future might be at
stake." Also universities
should " examine the areas
within which it would be ap-
propriate for disciplinary re-
sponsibility to be delegated
to the student body."
Whofathis cripple anyway?
GUILDS FRESHER MEETING
The Guilds Union meet-
ing for Freshers a week last
Thursday was as usual a
sketch of life at the College
as it is not. The impression
Certainly was that it is a
melee of fun and frolic
mixed with painting police-
men white at Morphy Day,
Fancy Dress Balls with un-
speilable titles and just a
little academic work for fla-
vouring.
The lecture theatre was
crammed full with students
soaking up this half hour of
confusion. For a confusion
it was and as such it broke
the ice of apprehension.
Through all this came a
regular stream of advice.
The freshers were told who
to see if anything was dis-
turbing Jhem and were
urged to attend various
functions that were useful
or which guaranteed a
smashing time.
After a boisterous des-
cription of mascotry at Im-
perial tie freshers were in-
formed abotit the Old Cen-
tralians and what they were
and invited them to attend
the dinners.
Next, several union wor-
thies were introduced in-
cluding the Year Represen-
Voting
tatives. They were told
that until 4th November,
they were to be represented
by the 2nd year Reps, when
they would be helped to
choose two of their own;
one academic rep and one
sports rep.
This was followed by a
short chat about the two
Guilds' affairs. One was the
all-night fancy dress ball
and the other an equally ex-
pensive dinner party.
The meeting broke up
with the traditional "Boom-
alaka" chanted to the
Guilds' Spanner held aloft
in the president's right hand.
The Vice - Chancellors
Committee joined with the
National Union of Students
in " welcoming the Govern-
ment's decision to accept the
recommendation of the
Latey Committee that the
legal age of majority be
lowered to 18." They also
recognised that this would
alter some of the responsi-
bilities of the University
with regard to student wel-
fare.
The last point the state-
ment dealt with was freedom
of speech. All members of
a University should be pre-
pared to tolerate and pro-
tect " the expression of un-
popular opinions." However
freedom of speech must not
be exercised in ways which
infringe the rights and free-
dom of others."
