INT HAPPENINGS
IN ENTS
The Entertainments Committee must be congratulated
for the way they managed last year to provide groups and
ideas which were widely appreciated within the College.
Also they made a large profit for thz first time in years.
At the end of the-first, term last year the committee were
$500 in debt; within four months this became a £1,000
profit. This was entirely due to the highly imaginative hard
work and enthusiasm of Pete Nicolls, who, sadly at the
cost of bis college place, revolutionised the ideas behind
fcolleee entertainments.
Good
Attractions
He managed to overcome
the usual committee red
tape and acting as booking
manager was able to book
bigger and more attractive
groups than had ever been
done before. He showed
that with good publicity and
hard work, despite the risks
involved, large profits can
be made even with the
limited facilities at College.
With amazing foresight he
booked Joe Cocker and
Spooky Tooth, who only
weeks afterwards became
much sought after per-
formers. His Traffic con-
cert was a huge success.
Among the many new ideas
he injected into Ents was
that of holding Friday night
concerts. The main reason
why Pete Nicholls was so
successful was that he had
contacts within the pop in-
dustry (he is now road ma-
nager for Joe Cocker) and
also he was not afraid to
follow his ideas through to
their conclusion.
This Years
Chairman
Not surprisingly, Pete
Nicholls was to be this
year's Chairman, replacing
Keith Guy who held the
post last year. It is surpris-
ing, however, that ideas
formulated and agreed on
last year are being dis-
banded, especially the idea
of Friday night concerts
which I understand the act-
ing Chairman (the post is
still officially vacant) Keith
Guy is not in favour of this
year. Surely Ents should
continue in the same way as
last year, providing origi-
nality as well as the Usual
£15 groups that grace the
Union on most Saturday
nights.
I think that new blood
should be infused as much
as possible into an organisa-
tion such as Ents which
thrives only on new ideas
and different approaches. It
would be beneficial to Ento
if tkfy elected a new Chair-
man and let Keith Guy
either rise to join his friends
in the Union hierarchy or
take the job of Ents trea-
surer. I understand he
would get a lot of support
if he chose the latter.
Serious
Outcome
There are few things as
boring as college politics
but, whatever the outcome
of the pending elections for
the post of chairman, Ents
who have always been
plagued by friction within
(there was a strong move
last year to oust Keith Guy
from his post) and harsh
criticism from all sections
of the college community,
should settle down and pro-
duce Entertainments which
are appreciated. They
managed to do it last year.
M A R T I N F A I R C L O U G H
THEY TELL ME...
STUDENT
HOUSES
Dave Harris tells me that
the complex business of
moving into Student Houses
is being mastered. When
I spoke to him, furniture
was still arriving and some-
thing was about to be done
towards removing the dirt
left in the rooms by the
builders—and the previous
occupants.
Lack of
Amenities
However, the complaints
still roll in about lack of
cooking and other amenities,
furniture and inadequate
toilet faciilties.
There are about five bogs
and baths for 60 and a third
of the rooms have wash-
basins. The real problem,
ICU secretary Harris and
his lads agree, is the ground-
floor and basement, where
one wash-basin is meant to
serve them all.
Rise in
Hall rents?
It's clear that something
must be done about selling
Student Houses to next
year's potential applicants.
Harris agrees that a major
difficulty in attracting stu-
dents of the right calibre
from the lure of the well-
appointed and convenient
Halls is the unfavourable
comparison of Hall and
Student House rents. As the
College refuses to subsidise
the latter, it could be that
Hall rents will have to rise.
Second
House
Scandal
But the biggest scandal
concerns the unfortunate
would-be residents of the
second Student House. The
student-warden, Ian Wells,
wrote on 21st August to tell
his prospective residents
that they couldn't move in
at the beginning of term and
they would have to find
alternative accommodation
through U . L . U . lodgings
bureau. Naturally, the ac-
commodation they did find
at such short notice left
much to be desired. Dave
Harris has fitted as many as
possible into his house and if
he'd known earlier, space
might have been found for
more.
Previous
Warning
However, the real surprise,
is that Ray Phillips, last
year's President, realised
last June that the second
house wouldn't be ready un-
til Christmas. Harris knew
too, and placed the bottom
16 successful applicants on
the waiting list—so the peo-
ple nominated by the Halls
for the second house
wouldn't lose both a Hall
and a House place. Miss
Burns in the Halls of Resi-
dence Office says that every-
one who went to Union
General Meetings knew.
Building
Tricks
Former Mines' President,
Wells, told me that the
places in his house should
never have been allocated,
but also blamed the college
authorities and especially the
builders. Apparently it's a
favourite trick in the build-
ing business never to give a
date when the work will be
finished, and Wells had to
badger the Clerk of Works
on the site, for his informa-
tion.
Which leaves our poor
putative residents wondering
where to go next knowing
that somewhere "someone"
has blundered."
DROP
OUTS
Failure rate is something
that concerns us all and it's
good to see the College tak-
ing-an interest. A sub-com-
mittee of the Medical Ser-
vices Committee started by
studying the medical aspects
of certain cases of failure,
and the registry now informs
Rob Collinge's I C U wel-
fare Committee that they
are broadening their scope.
This summer the University
Grants Committee reported
that only 9 per cent of Arts
students failed, but the fi-
gures for scientists and en-
gineers were much higher—
14 and 22 per cent respec-
tively. The well known
i higher failure rate of Wo-
men at I.C. is apparently
peculiar to science and
technology, although more
women leave without de
grees for what the report
terms " other reasons." The
failure rate for overseas
students is also higher than
for home students.
No figures are yet avail
able, despite promises from
the College that they would
be, to compare this year's
I.C. failure rate with last
Physics 2, however, regards
losing about 20 members
over the summer as "usual."
Chris Parker
They tell me that Chris
Parker (known to his ene-
mies as Cf) fears an anti-
candidate will be found to
keep him off council. To
many, the spectacle would
be rather ironic; after all an
anti-candidate against the
right would leave them ra-
ther hoist with their own
petard.
Spike Bant in
A l l Southside seems cer-
tain that popular Spike Ban-
tin is the favourite for the
Halls rep. vacancy on coun-
cil. If Spike has his way, it
could be the last time the
rep. is elected by the Halls'
in-crowd and he plans too
a big shake-up in Halls se-
lection procedures. There
is a touch of irony here, too,
because Spike could well
find his way onto Council
through the failure to re-
turn of Dick James, his pro-
poser for floor rep. in his un-
successful bid to get onto
Council 1st June, Which all
seems only fair to those who
felt the well-known anti-
pathy between James and
ICU cost Bantin that elec-
tion.
LES EBDON
The first subject I would like to deal with in Biis issue
is money or, to be more exact, Union finance. Last year,
out of our total Income of about £21,000 nearly £15,000
was in the form of Union fees. These fees are included in
the College fee, which means that for most of you they
are paid by the body that pays your grant. The fee has
been four pounds for many years and is one of the lowest of
any college or university in the country. For as long as I
can remember, people have been talking about our fees
going up and now at long last it has happened.
College fees have gone up by two pounds a head, as
you will nave seen in a letter the Registrar sent to all
students. Of this, the Union is to get 30s. Because the
Governors had been unable to negotiate a fee increase for
us until now, they have provided the money to meet our
losses for the past few years. This extra finance was
about £3.000 yast year and a total-of £4,300; the other
10s. of the fee increase will be used to pay this total back to
the governors and then the Union will receive the extra 10s.
as well.
This means that we shall now be able to start to put
money back into the Union reserves, which will be needed
for the eventual refurnishing of the Union areas in South-
side and for the furnishing of College Block.
Even so, we should have some money left over and
the expansion of Union activities, which of necessity has
been slowed down of recent years, may now have more
chance to go ahead.
EVENING COFFEE
Last year a scheme was concocted by the Overseas
Students Committee and by the Welfare Committee for a
Coffee Bar, run in the evenings. Everyone seemed to have
a different idea about where it should be, ranging from
cellars on North Side, Princes Gardens, to the old Snack
Bar in Beit, which will close when the new facilities open
in College Block. Eventually Southside Snack bar and
Upper Lounge was agreed on, as at least the temporary
home, and it has been opened for a trial period of one
month. If it is a success, then it will carry on and perhaps
even move to a better home. So if you don't drink or
don't feel like drinking, or just fancy a snack in the evening,
then try Southside Coffee Bar, open from 7 p.m. to 10.30
p.m.
LODGINGS BUREAU
Some people prefer being in London, some don't, bu4
almost all agree that finding somewhere to live is "still the
biggest problem. In the past, the London University
Lodgings Bureau has been unable to provide yery much
accommodation in the area of I C or very much in the
Iprm of flats or bedsitters. This has cut down their use to
a lot of IC students. Now a West London Branch is being
started up and it is hoped to install it on the ground floor
of 8 Princes Gardens around the end of November or the
beginning of December. I hope that this new service will
be able to spread its wings and deal with local accommo-
dation as well as digs in the outer areas like Putney or
Wimbledon.
