Lords And Ladies
by Terry Pratchett
There may be those among you who, like me,
thought that fairies are dainty butterfly-like
creatures who live at the bottom of your garden,
well this book ought to put that right.
This book is a must for all those fans of
Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat
Garlick and, incidentally, Terry Pratchett.
Set in the magical Discworld, it attempts to
weave scientific theory with magical
phenomenon and has a bit of Shakespeare on a
Midsummer Night thrown in for good measure.
It is the story of how the three witches stop
the return of the not-so-nice fairies/elves, who
make masochists look like a bunch of Sunday
School picnickers.
It is the reckoning of both Granny and
Magrat, what with new witches springing up
everywhere and Magrat having her intended
groom being kidnapped by the queen of the
fairies.
In the end, everyone bands together,
including a set of morris dancers, an orang-utan,
wizards, dwarfs and ordinary cowards beating
the baddies. We learn that the attraction of the
ordinary person to them is just an effect of the
fake glamour they project, much like a real life
scenario.
It is somewhat of a tongue-in-check
commentary on many contemporary issues such
as royalty, power, women's lib, marriage,
glamour and image.
It succeeds in conveying the brand of humour
which the author is good at and which everyone
wants but ends up feigning, i.e. warm and
observant.
This science fiction fantasy has marvellously
polydimensional characterisation, a lack of
which other books of the same genre are
criticised for.
Thus it has a mixture of all that is required
for a good book: storyline, humour, suspense
and a frightfully, but not too clich6d, happy
ending.
A l l in a l l , it is a good introduction to
Pratchett's style of writing, and a great part of
the series for a fan.

It Doesn't
Take A Hero
by Norman Schwarzkopf
Norman Schwarzkopf sprang to fame during the
Gulf War of 1990/91. His autobiography tells of
the career that led him to be Commander-in-
Chief for all Gulf War coalition forces, from the
military academy, through his promotion to
four-star general in 1988, to the climax in the
deserts of Iraq and Kuwait, to which a major
part of the book is dedicated. This part makes
for fascinating reading, revealing a lot more
than news programmes ever could. The reader
can appreciate what a huge task Schwarzkopf
had (he was up against the world's fourth largest
army of 545,000 troops, and their associated
equipment).
A l l in all, this book makes for gripping
reading. Told in an often light-hearted way.
Schwarzkopf comes across as being dedicated to
his cause. For those of us with any ambition,
General H . Norman Schwarzkopf should serve
as an inspiration.
