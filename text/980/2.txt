Smith Shuns Tory Science
B Y P A U L D I A S
A N D J O E M C F A D D E N
Labour Party leader John Smith,
speaking to a packed Great Hall at
Imperial College on Wednesday,
promised to establish a Ministry for
Science if Labour wins the next
election. The public meeting was
organised by the Save British
Science society (SBS), a pressure
group aiming to improve public
awareness of science and influence
Government science policy.
William Waldegrave, Minister
of Science, spoke to a SBS meeting
at Imperial College earlier this year,
but Mr Smith is the first leader of a
political party to address the
society. His speech was generally
well-received, though some crit-
icised it for containing few concrete
science policies.
The Labour leader discussed at
length the neglected state of British
science. Unsurprisingly, he blamed
the Government's obsession with
market economics for the lack of
cooperation between industry and
academic research, adding that he
felt it was "shameful that an organ-
isation like Save British Science
should be required to exist at all".
Mr Smith claimed that science
had suffered as a result of the
Government's policy of reducing
public expenditure. Speaking in
Tokyo recently, John Major, the
Prime Minister, commented that
"perhaps we have undervalued
science and the application of
science in the U K " . M r Smith
suggested that 'perhaps' the Prime
Minister couldn't make up his
mind. "Surely even the Government
cannot doubt that science and
technology, education and training
are crucial to economic growth," he
added.
He went on to criticise the
Science White Paper for doing little
more than reorganising the science
research councils. In an interview
with IC Radio earlier this week,
Professor J-P. Connerade, the
Honourary Treasurer of SBS, also
criticised the White Paper, calling it
'a rather disappointing document'.
Professor Connerade, a lecturer at
Imperial College's Department of
Physics, complained that "nothing
is said at all about improving the
career prospects of young scientists."
Mr Smith touched on this issue
during his speech, stating that "it is
little short of scandalous that
doctoral students should be ex-
pected to live on a total of £4,730 a
year". But he did not explain how
Labour would provide the funding
'to attract the best talents available'.
The Labour leader recognised
the importance of both pure and
applied research, saying that the
only real difference between the
two "is that some research has been
applied and some has not yet been
applied". Labour would offer a
scientific organisation with
"networks in which scientists and
members of the business and
financial community mix and
exchange ideas". He proposed
establishing 'intermediate insti-
tutions' along the lines of the 'so-
called Faraday Centres' in order to
encourage such networks.
Another priority of Mr Smith's
was getting more teenagers to
continue with science beyond
G C S E by replacing the A-Level
with a broader qualification, thus
ensuring that "pupils at the age of
seventeen shouldn't have to choose
between the arts and sciences the
way they have to under the present
system".
Professor Connerade remains
unconvinced that any political party
can provide a solution to the
problems facing British science.
"Politicians have yet to learn how
important science is to British
society and to broadcast this fact to
their electorate. This may be partly
because they are not themselves
scientists."
Drugs and
Arson Attack
in Hall
B Y P A U L D I A S
A N D L Y N N B R A V E Y
A student was expelled from
Linstead Hall last week by a
residence tribunal which followed a
drugs investigation. James Wilson,
a second year chemist, was found
in possession of a small amount of
cannabis and had been smoking it
on the premises.
Dr Jan Bradley, warden of
Linstead Hall, told Felix that she
was alerted to the situation when a
plumber, who had been called to fix
a blocked sink, informed the house
keeper of the smell of an illicit
substance. "I then requested advice
from Imperial College Security,
who came over to speak to M r
Wilson. This was a few hours later
and there was still a smell of
drugs," said Dr Bradley, adding
that M r Wilson "admitted a fair
cop".
Terry Briley, Imperial College's
Deputy Security Manager, said that
"the police were contacted
following the drugs find and are
always informed of any such cases
at Imperial College".
After a separate residence
tribunal, another student was
dismissed from a hall of residence.
This followed a Hallowe'en Party at
Tizard Hall. The student concerned,
a resident of the Hall, set fire to a
chair that was occupied by a female
student, who was not hurt in the
incident.
One resident commented: "It
was a stupid accident that should
never have happened."
Cyberpunks and the
Aero Student
B Y A N D R E W T S E N G
A research student at Imperial
College is the star of a television
programme being broadcast next
week.
Monday sees the showing of a
programme called Cyberpunks and
Technophobes. It is presented by
Tim Parsons, a PhD student at the
Department of Aeronautical Engin-
eering. Mr Parsons, in addition to
presenting it, has participated in the
research, direction, interviewing
and editing of the programme.
In it, T i m talks to Douglas
Adams, author of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy, and William
Waldegrave (amongst others) in an
attempt to explain the exodus of
potential science students to the
arts.
Cyberpunks and Technophobes
will be shown on Monday at
6.35pm on BBC2. Those in College
can see it in Da Vinci's.
