Fridays at Imperial College Union
Bar 'til lam
Admission £ 1
(more on band nights)
8pm ~ 2am
Behold ! In the creation
Of the heavens and the earth;
In the alternation
Of the Night and the Day;
In the sailing of the ships
Through the ocean
For the profit of mankind;
In the rain which God
Sends down from the skies,
And the life which He gives therewith
To an earth that is dead ;
In the beasts of all kinds
That He scatters through the earth ;
In the change of the winds,
And the clouds which they trail like
their slaves
Between the sky and the earth ;
(Here) indeed are Signs
For a people that are wise.
