Government presses ahead despite student and university opposition
Union Reform Legislation Imminent
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
AND DECLAN CURRY
The Government has stated its
intention to pass a bill on
fundamental Student Union reform
within the next parliamentary
session. The decision was
announced yesterday in the Queen's
speech.
The speech said that the
government ' w i l l introduce
legislation to reform student
unions'. It did not mention any
details of the proposed bill, but the
legislation is expected to closely
resemble the package of reforms
unveiled by John Patten, the
Education Secretary, last July (Felix
972).
The promise to legislate has
been condemned by national
student leaders and opposition
parties, but welcomed by the
Conservative Students organisation.
Tim Kevan, National Director,
declared himself 'delighted' with
the announcement, adding that
reforms would "confine the student
union closed shop to the bin."
Don Foster, M P for Bath and
Liberal Democrat Education
Spokesman, called the announce-
ment a bitter disappointment.
Lorna Fitzsimons, President of
the National Union of Students
(NUS), said the decision to
introduce legislation 'has been
taken against the advice of
university vice-chancellors, college
principals, parliamentarians,
students and their parents'.
The N U S revealed plans to
become a charity at the end of last
month. This may enable it to
sidestep the Government's
proposals. The charity would deal
purely with matters of student
interest, leaving all political
campaigning to a separate arm of
the NUS. This arm would be funded
by voluntary membership contri-
butions from student unions.
The legislation itself is expected
to be similar to the package of
reforms unveiled by John Patten last
July. The plans proposed the
introduction of voluntary mem-
bership for some student union
activities, and the restructuring of
funding into essential (core) and
peripheral areas. This means that
services such as sport, welfare and
representation would continue to
receive Government funding.
Activities such as political, social
and recreational societies would be
funded by other sources.
According to Andrew Wensley,
ICU President, ICU would have to
raise an extra Â£200,000 a year if the
reforms were implemented.
The proposals were criticised by
the Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals in a report earlier this
month. The Committee described
the implementation as 'damaging
and unworkable'. They suggested, a
rethink of what constituted 'core'
services, and codes of practice for
unions as a solution.
Conservative Party insiders say
that Mr Patten still regards student
union reform as essential, and say
earlier reports that an announce-
ment would be made (Felix 968)
were always correct. Labour Party
sources say privately that they did
not expect an announcement.
Conservative activists predict
full blooded reform, as opposed to a
simple code of conduct. But, any
legislation has to circumvent a
brewing Tory back bench revolt on
the issue. Potential rebels include
Robert Jackson, the former higher
education minister who conducted a
review of student unions in 1988.
M r Jackson, who quit the
Government earlier this year, has
already said he will vote against any
moves which will extend Govern-
ment power over universities. He
claims to have the support of a
number of other Conservative back
benchers, and points out that 'it
would only take six or eight
Conservatives' to provoke a
government defeat. However,
Andrew Wensley commented
"we've got a fight on our hands to
make the Government see sense."
IC Obtains Powers
BY ANDREW TSENG,
NEWS EDITOR
Powers demanded by the former
Rector of Imperial College have, in
principle, been granted. Following a
meeting of the University of
London's Senate, Schools of the
University will be 'delegated' the
right to award degrees and appoint
senior academic staff.
The decision by Senate comes
after over a years discussion which
was triggered by Sir Eric Ash, the
former Rector, in last years
Commemoration Day speech. In it
he said, "we have resolved to
embark on a review...to examine the
possibility of a separation from the
University of London." As a result,
Professor Stuart Sutherland, the
Vice-Chancellor of the University
of London, presented a paper in
March detailing three paths that the
University could take. Option A ,
was for there to be no change; the
second Option, B , detailed the
position of the University if the
constituent Schools became
universities in their own right and
Option C proposed that the Uni-
versity devolve the power to award
degrees and appoint senior
academic staff, to its individual
Schools.
Although accepted at July's
Senate, discussion of the paper was
deferred until Wednesday this
week, the first Senate of the
academic year. Derek Roberts,
Provost of University College
London, welcomed the 'considered'
paper, saying that it was an
"excellent way forward for the
University." Very little resistance to
the paper was met, however, Dr
William Stephenson, representing
the University's teachers, did
express some concern that the
paper, 'attempted to be all things to
all people'.
Professor Sutherland also made
three recommendations which
essentially proposed that Option C
was accepted and implemented. The
recommendations were accepted
without any opposition. Though
some present abstained, support for
them was so overwhelming that a
count was not necessary.
Speaking to Felix after the
meeting, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the
Rector, said: "I think that in the
long term one would be looking in
this direction, but the situation
changes continuously, there is
1 1
always a balance of considerations
that must be taken into account." Sir
Ronald did however think that there
were very few disadvantages. He
added that, "it was argued [at
Senate] that the University cannot
in a formal sense delegate its
powers, but it can delegate
mechanisms".
The Schools of the University of
London have now been authorised
in principle to award University of
London degrees and appoint senior
academic staff on behalf of the
University. The implementation is
to be left to the new Governing
Body of the University of London
when it is established later this year.
