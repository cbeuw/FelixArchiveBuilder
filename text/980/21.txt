Union General Meetings
Hands up all those who will be going to the
U G M this Friday lunchtime. Not very many, I
shouldn't wonder. I know that quite a few turned
up to the last one, but compared to the number
of students at Imperial College, it was a very
poor show. But why? Many people blame
apathy amongst the students.
Maybe, instead, it is because no-one knows
about the UGMs and what they involve. Brief
details were put into the Union Handbook, but
unless someone sits down and explains it all to
you, you really don't know what's going on. The
only reason I went to a U G M in my first year
was because explained it all to me. But, quite
frankly, I found it very boring. It seemed to be a
lot of people sitting around and discussing
pointless motions and reporting on what they'd
been up to for the last few weeks.
But I stuck it out and went to a few more
U G M s . Every now and again something
important or relevant or interesting did come up.
For example, I bet you hadn't noticed that the
Union Bookstore and the chocolate machine in
the Union building didn't stock any Nestl6
products. This was because of a motion passed
at a U G M .
So, interesting things do happen every now
and again. A lot of it may seem irrelevant and
boring and you will have to sit through a lot of
stuff that will seem boring, but it will affect you.
Things are changing and you ought to be there
to make sure that you approve of what is being
done. See you there.

Life In The Freezer
David Attenborough's latest nature-type
programme made it onto the screens on
Thursday evening. Lots of antarctic wildlife and
lots of icebergs. Maybe he should have poked
his nose into the Felix Office earlier on this
week. I'm surprised we didn't get more than just
our resident Penguin wandering through.
Why so cold, you may ask? Well, some
clever person managed to drill through one of
the pipes in the Union building, so the whole
place was without heating for a day or so.
Now, this may not sound like too much of a
problem; just wear an extra jumper and it'll tie
OK. But it wasn't as simple as that. (Things
never are, are they!)
Felix is printed in the Union building and the
paper on which Felix is printed is a .bit
temperature sensitive. So, turning off the heating
meant problems. Big problems. The paper gets
cold, then the paper gets warmed up, then the
paper doesn't feed through the litho properly,
then the printing gets later and later and then the
printer (hello Inky) gets unhappy. Not a nice
thing to happen. And it looks like it will happen
all over again next week since the heating is
going off over the weekend. Great, huh.
Anyone got a spare 120,000 sheets of paper
which won't be sitting in the cold all weekend?
We'd love to know if you have!
