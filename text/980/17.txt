TOMORROW
NOVEMBER
The present state of the National Health
Service is enough to make anyone sick with
worry.
Patients are queuing for treatment. Hospitals
are being shut and wards left empty. And
many staff face redundancy, despite shortages.
Government ministers are to blame - with their
spending curbs and so-called reforms.
But the NHS is a popular service funded with
taxpayers' money.
Polls have shown people are willing to
maintain the service through taxes.
It should have enough cash to ensure first-class
care.
That is why the TUC is urging people to come
together on November 20 for NHS Emergency
Day.
This national march and rally will demonstrate
support for the NHS and concern about its
welfare. Assemble at 11AM in Jubilee Gardens,
London SE1, and march to the rally in
Trafalgar Square at 2PM.
