Careers Fair Thanks
Dear Beccy,
At last it's over. Anyone who made it into the
Great Hall and the JCR at the start of this week
could not have failed to notice this year's
Imperial College Union Careers Fair. During the
two days, over 3,000 students came to see 42
different graduate employers and companies.
Organising the Careers Fair would not have
been possible without the help and advice of
many people. These are, in no particular order:
Simon Govier
Marc Ellis
Stephen Dunton
Dave Henderson-Begg
Fiona Grandison
Tom Cunnington
Rose Atkins
Michelle Began
Andy Thompson
Andy Nu
Gina Mortley
Rebecca Land
Graham Cox
Park Communications
the staff of QT and the JCR
and last, but by no means least, the College
security staff.
I hope all the people that attended found it
useful and I wish them every success in their
future job hunting.
Yours,
Steven Newhouse

You're a student, so you know the feeling: into
the third week of term and your entire measly
grant has run out, your NatWest bank manager
has a poster depicting you as Public Enemy
Nunber 1, the Glasgow-based Student Loans
Company has apparently been taken over by
Scottish Nationalists and won't give you a loan,
and your Mum and Dad - normally very polite -
say "Look, just piss off, you scrounger".
(Of course, you beg them and say that the
money will really be spent on tinned tuna at
Sainsbury's. That you haven't been to a pub for
ages. But your smart-alec answer " O f course
not, money grows on bushes. Everyone knows
that" hasn't endeared you to them very much.)
I could talk about the theory of student
finances. About how this miserly Tory
government has cut student funding by X % in
real terms over Y years. About how much better
the Australian Graduate Tax system is. About
the inequity that university students are almost
all from bourgeoisie backgrounds. And I could
quote zillions of studies by the Policy Studies
Institute/Institute for Public Policy Research/
Institute for Fiscal Studies (rearrange, delete as
appropriate) about further education as
investment for the future.
But this doesn't solve the immediate
problem. (Even worse, it makes me sound like a
LibDem.) You're skint broke, reduced to
nicking sandwiches from the QT (a deplorable
state, indeed). One solution (perhaps not open to
all) is to do what Nils does and to use your
Kenyan Fund. The idea, in economic terms, is to
discount your future earnings and spend them
currently. In other words, spend money that you
are planning to earn in the near future.
Nils is quite a master at this kind of stuff. He
uses his credit cards as a bridging facility to the
summer holidays (when the earnings start to roll
in) and transfers money in-between his four
accounts like a real wheeler-dealer. A l l of this
obscures the fact that he is massively in the red.
But the lack of money now is a trivial fact.
Possible earnings in the future are what really
matter.
Anyone objecting to the use of a Kenyan
Fund should perhaps take Mr J Christ's dictum
about "he without guilt casting the first stone"
into account: Do 'real-world adults' not do the
same thing with their mortgages and other
loans?
