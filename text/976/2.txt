Over 3,000 students attended the
Imperial College Union Careers
Fair on Monday and Tuesday this
week. The Fair, held in the Junior
Common Room and the Great Hall,
enabled students to discover what
the 42 participating organ-isations
had to offer in the way of
employment this year.
News Editor, spoke to Felix about
the result: "Shortlisting for the NUS
Award is a remarkable award to the
hard work of Chris Riley and his
Science Communication MSc team;
I hope they do equally well this
year under the firm direction of
Paul Dias."
Other categories were dominated
by London Student, the University
of London Student Newspaper. It
won three awards outright,
including Best Student Newspaper,
and Best Student Journalist. It has
been noted that present amongst
the panel of judges was an
ex-London Student editor.
Felix sends its congratulations to
the winners and its condolences to
IC Radio.
"From the students' point of
view, it was a success," commented
Steven Newhouse, the Careers Fair
Manager, after the event. "I would
like to thank my stewards who
performed excellent work over both
days ... and also Rose Atkins and
Michelle Began for taking messages
for the past six months."
Mr Newhouse did express some
concern felt by the employers
Former Imperial College Union
President, Sydney Harbour-
Bridge's marriage proposal had
been rejected for the second time
by his girlfriend because of his
name.
Mr Harbour-Bridge, was elected
ICU President in 1987 under the
name of Ian Howgate, but changed
his name by deed poll to raise
money for Comic Relief during his
term of office.
Sydney has proposed twice to
his girlfriend, Jacqueline Scott, and
Miss Scott has twice turned down
the offer because she does not wish
to become Mrs Sydney Harbour-
Bridge.
Sydney, currently working as a
tax consultant, refuses to change
his name back again.
The results in full are:
Best Student Newspaper: London
Student; Runner-up: Leeds Student

(Liverpool John Moores); Runner-
up: Isis (Oxford)

945 (UEA)
Best Student Broadcaster: Sue
Cain (Bloomsbury TV, UCL)
attending the Careers Fair: "Several
companies commented on the lack
of knowledge that some students
showed in the graduate recruitment
process."
Competition this year promises
to be fierce. Although statistics
show that the rate of graduate
employment should rise this year,
students cannot afford to get
complacent.
Surgical
Spirit
BY OUR NEWS T E A M
Imperial College has had yet
another first. Ms Averil Mansfield
is the first woman to become a
surgical professor heading an
academic department in the United
Kingdom. This follows her
appointment to Professor of
Vascular Surgery at St Mary's
Hospital Medical School. She has
been made Director of the
Department of Surgery at St
Mary's.
Professor Peter Richards, Dean
of St. Mary's said that the title was
conferred "purely and only on
merit". He was, however, delighted
at the revelation. "We did not at the
time realise that this was a first. But
with more than 50 per cent of new
medical students in the U K being
women, it is good news that a
woman has reached the top of the
surgical academic tree."
Professor Mansfield is currently
conducting a major multicentre
European trial on the place of
carotid artery surgery in the
prevention of strokes.
Mining Impact
BY PAUL DIAS
The environmental impact of
mining is to be investigated by Dr
John Monhemius, the latest arrival
at Imperial College's Department
of Mineral Resources Engineering.
Dr Monhemius has been appointed
to the new R T Z Roy Wright
Readership in Environmental
Engineering, which has been
created to focus on research applied
to mining and the processing of
minerals and metals.
Dr Monhemius' research
interests concentrate on improving
methods for recovery of metals
from ores. He intends to direct his
efforts towards the environmental
problems associated with current
mining methods, and to the
minimisation of waste products.
The chairman of R T Z
Corporation, Sir Derek Birkin, said
that the new Readership is a
further, significant step in the
recognition of the importance of the
environmental aspects of mining.
