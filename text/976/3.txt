Concern raised over College's
disciplinary procedure
King's College Rape Crisis
BY SHAUN JOYNSON
Imperial College Union's Womens'
Officer, Nicky Fox, is urging
women to by-pass College
procedures and "go straight to the
police" in cases of alleged rape or
sexual assault.
Ms Fox was speaking following
the acquittal of Austen Donnellan
(21), of King's College, who was
accused of raping a fellow student.
The case was delayed for several
months because College authorities
tried to deal with the matter
internally. The case only came to
court because the defendant
protested his innocence and
demanded the police be brought in.
Ms Fox condemned as "disgusting"
the apparent attempt by King's
College authorities to cover up the
matter.
Early reporting of sex assaults
by a male student is vital, Ms Fox
believes, as the medical exam-
ination that will be carried out by
the police could provide the vital
evidence needed to secure a
conviction.
Ms Fox also said that when
women have been assaulted, the
first thing they should do is call the
police and then college security if
the incident occurs within college
Radical changes to Imperial College
Union (ICU) are promised at
today's Union General Meeting
(UGM).
The U G M marks the second and
final stage of the introduction of a
new ICU constitution. The reforms,
spearheaded by Chris Davidson,
last year's I C U President, include
the conversion of the Executive
Committee to a decision making
body and the abolishment of
Council.
The reforms were designed to
increase the representation of
students. As such, through a
hierarchy of representation, every
single aspect of student life at
Imperial College should be
reflected in the new Executive
grounds. Where the assault occurs
in a student's lodgings or off
college grounds she says that there
is no reason to refer to college
security and to go straight to the
police.
Realising the ordeal many
women could face in sex assault
cases, Ms Fox qualified her advice
by saying that a deciding factor in
whether a woman reported a sex
assault or rape to the police would
be the personality of the victim.
Whilst recognising that the
police take a more sympathetic
attitude to rape, she warned that
lawyers acting for the defendant
would try to use the woman's
sexual history in order to secure an
acquittal for their client.
"Let's say a woman has had
several sexual encounters (prior to
the incident), then the defence will
bring this up." Nonetheless,
continued Ms Fox, the police will
be supportive towards the woman
and give her plenty of en-
couragement.
Ms Fox's advice was supported
by a leading women's pressure
group who demanded on IC Radio
that the Crown Prosecution Service
(CPS) bring every rape case to
court, even if there is a risk of the
accused being acquitted.
Committee. In addition, the changes
attempt to increase the account-
ability of those 'in power' by
holding U G M s more frequently.
Under the new reforms, U G M s
would be monthly rather than
termly.
If the constitution is passed then
the Executive Committee w i l l
become a sub-committee of a Union
General Meeting. This means that,
subject to certain limitations, it will
be empowered to make decisions on
behalf of the sovereign body, the
Union General Meeting. This is a
substantial change from the old
Council which, though it made
decisions, did not have the backing
of a Union General Meeting.
Following a wide-ranging outcry
Kate Wheldon, spokesman for
Women Against Rape made the
demand during the interview on
Wednesday night. She told
presenter Declan Curry that only
one in twelve cases were ever
brought to court and claimed that
many men were not being charged
because women were frightened of
being stigmatised if they admitted
they had been raped.
She also hit out at the press
reaction to the Donnellan case,
claiming that the media were
holding Mr Donnellan up as a hero.
"The press have used this case to
attack all women," she said. Ms
Wheldon pointed out that the
conviction rate for rapists was one
of the lowest for any type of
criminal offence. She blamed this
on both the way in which the police
handle rape cases and the direction
judges give to juries in telling them
not to accept the woman's story
without corroboration.
Ms Wheldon criticised the
attitudes of the police and CPS to
rape saying that it made many
women wary of reporting incidents
and could even encourage potential
rapists. "If men feel that women
aren't going to be able to report it,
that is when they rape.".
by supporters of the Constituent
College Unions and the revelation
that the Chairmen of the Major Sub-
committees (SCC, S C A B etc) do
not wish to be members of the
Executive Committee (their
representation being satisfied by the
various sabbaticals), amendments
are also likely to be put to the U G M
on these matters.
Commenting on, the U G M ,
Andrew Wensley, ICU President,
said, "it should be fun. I hope to see
you all there. It w i l l be very
enabling for the officers of I C U
who can now get on and work."
The U G M will take place at 1 pm
in the Junior Common Room (JCR).

Concerns
Over Security

Security are asking residents to
challenge people entering Halls of
Residence without a security card.
The request follows a fortnight of
malicious vandalism occurring in
some Halls of Residence.
On Tuesday this week, a games
machine was vandalised during the
lunchtime period in Linstead Hall.
A similar incident occurred two
weeks before, involving another
games machine in Linstead Hall.

Save British Science meeting, we listed
Jean Patrick Connerade as the contact
