Pooka
Pooka
That Pooka consist of two female
twentysomething folkies is not out of order.
That they have been likened to Joni Mitchell
and PJ Harvey is more so, particularly as for
once the comparison is fair(ish). Yet the many
servings on offer here are too raw to be easily
digestible, although the fact that this is a debut
album should have something to do with it. Oh
the idealism of youth. The PJHness of the album
can be most clearly seen in the lyrical violence:
"You can drink from me/Eat from my body",
"Then with a big bite/I tore his head off, "Play
the game/I want to treat you cruel."
Now maybe this is deconstrutionism on my
part because these lyrics are not really obvious
just from a casual listening, but they are there
nevertheless. Only the mournful slide guitar of
'City Sick' and the jaunty 'Graham Robert
Parker' wrench a smile from the grimace.
Which is a shame because I wanted to like this
for credibility purposes and now find myself
marking it down. I'm disappointed. (4)

Painters
Red House Painters
I didn't know what to expect of this album - the
sleeve gives no clue except the 4 A D label,
which suggests either the Cocteau Twins or The
Pixies. But the Red House Painters are an
anomaly owing more to the folk orientated rock
of the sixties than the modern indie music. The
sugar sweet harmonies are reminiscent of Simon
and Garfunkel, and it is no surprise that they
cover T A m A Rock' here. Their version is
darker and has a more melancholy edge.
'Evil's' refrain of "God do you look evil in
the dark?" is supported by a sparse arrangement
of chiming guitar and rippling cymbals to give a
strangely exciting feeling that words cannot
express. Like Neil Young at his best, the songs
are beautifully melodic and Mark Kozelek's
voice is rich and emotive. This is wonderful,
moody music to be heard alone late at night,
where no-one can see you cry. Wallow in it. (9)

Buffalo Tom
Big Red Letter Day
Pop to please the pure hearted. Buffalo Tom's
brand of ear-tickling thoughtful melodies are
like water to a drowning man-woman-
hermaphrodite. In this sad world of incessant
beat and three chord tricks it ranks up with
DaDa and their sadly neglected debut last year
(woah! mind the hobby horse). Not a duff track
in sight here with gems like 'I'm Allowed' and
'Anything That Way' shining bright in this
treasure chest. Talented strumming, listenable
hooks and a strong not-too-overproduced sound
are this trio's fourth foray into the album world.
I've heard that the live show they've been
touting around London lately is a winner, and
on the strength of this collection of songs I can
see why. Tipped as the next 'Next Big Thing'
this is one of the the one's to watch. Gushing?
Who me? Why not, it's excellent! (9)
