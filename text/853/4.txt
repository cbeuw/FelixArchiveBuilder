With a student loan, all manner of ingenious economies can be had. FELIX presents a Scratch 'n' Lick Christmas
dinner as advised by Ms Edwina Chillie. Simply cut out the food and lick your way to satisfaction, without
the bloated feeling.
Christmas on a loan
Vegetables. Such a constant reminder of those we
know and love at Christmas.
Water. I find water an excellent source of minerals
and extra Government revenue. Drink it while you can
still afford it.
Beef. Our artist objects to the battery farming of
poultry and, what's more, he can't draw Turkeys.
Fruit. Look, that is enough digging up of past
ministers.
Nuts and Crackers. No comment.
Christmas Cake. Proof positive that we can have the
cake without you eating it. Edwina
