Charlie English went to Berlin two weeks ago to see the new Berlin...
Tear down the wall!
Saturday; an early morning snowfall and below-zero
temperatures don't deter people in their thousands
from chipping away at the Berlin Wall. Freezing hands
wield hammers, chisels, screwdrivers and even
umbrellas against The Wall in an attempt to get hold
of what must be amongst the most prized souvenirs
in Europe.
The authorities on both sides seem uncertain as to
what to do. East German border guards patrol on top
of the Wall at the Brandenberg Gate, unarmed,
watching perplexedly as people as far as they can see
are gradually destroying the thing on which they
stand. West German police, after clamping down on
wall-chipping last week, now only half-heartedly try
to stop it. The result is a now gap-toothed barrier as
people scrape and tap away the poor quality cement
and concrete removing slivers from the joints between
the prefabricated blocks. The little flakes that are
removed are rumoured to be worth up to $5000 in
the States, so for many in Berlin what two weeks ago
mught have been a statement for freedom has now
become a lucrative business.
Meanwhile the East Germans themselves wander
around cautiously tasting capitalism like a first sip of
beer after a long period without-'l don't really need
it but...'. Temptation often wins in the end. A queue
for a 'Sex Show' stretches into the street; easterners
walk past parked cars reading out brand names
'Volvo...Mercedes...BMW...' and clutching stereo
radio cassettes. Cigarette manufacturers haven't been
slow to spot the opportunity, revelling in the vast new
potential market of denim clad Marlboro men. Girls are
employed to hand out cigarettes and leaflets to
amazed East Germans as if they were at a sponsored
event; 'Come together-learn to live as friends-Peter
Stuyvesant.' 'The West is Best' proclaims a huge
Marlboro banner over a railway bridge.
But the glory of the moment is not lost by the
cynicism of advertising. Walking alongside The Wall
people peer through the ever widening cracks as if
they will see something monstrous on the other side,
as if the wooden watch towers to look over into the
East do not exist. A group huddle round a tiny gap,
straining to see an East German border guard,
exchanging addresses, even buying pieces of wall for
Deutschmarks. The intermittent flow of 'Trabbies' is
interrupted for a moment by a breakdown: at once ten
West Germans gather round to help sort out the
problem, anxious to see the engine.
In the American sector, near Checkpoint Charlie, a
couple of guys are breaking off large slabs with a
sledge-hammer and handing it away to people. Here
Germans are almost outnumbered by American forces
personnel, some still in uniform, come for their bit; '
I
been here two and half years, I'd like a piece'. Some
speculate how much longer they will be in West
Germany: graffiti proclaims 'Checkpoint Charlie, made
redundant 9 Nov 1989'. Untrue, but typically
optimistic.
It has to be appropriate for this embodiment of the
Cold War to be eaten away slowly by thousands of
hands each taking away their own little fragments.
This probably isn't the end of the East-West divide,
perhaps not even the end of the divided Berlin, and
maybe these people's motives are not entirely
unselfish; yet there cannot be a more telling symbol
of popular opinion than the image of thousands of
people, from all over the free world, spontaneously
and simultaneously tapping away at The Wall. Chip,
chip, chip...
