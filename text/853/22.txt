Bristol II-2 IC IIâ€”0
IC ladies 2nds, still with a glimmer of a chance of glory
going through to the knockout stages of the UAU, had
a difficult trip to Bristol to face a well prepared and
over-confident team.
Bristol started the game on the offensive, only to
find the expert coaching of Sydney Harbour-Bridge
coming into play, with a very strong IC threesome at
the back denying them eveyr opportunity to score. All
their short corners were blocked well by Diana Hill and
Jane Bunch, and an excellent penalty flick save by
Alison Franklin denied them the lead, until a scrap in
the 'D' allowed them to tap the ball in to make it 1 -0
to Bristol.
In the half-time interval, coach Syd motivated the
tired and sweated bodies, and some good
perseverance from flu-ridden Diana and Oana Carlin
with a cut knee allowed us to start the second half.
Some excellent wobbling by Jackie Scott came to
nothing as our attack came into contact with their star
1st XI player at the back.
Bristol's three fresh pairs of legs were too much for
our defence and not even Hazel King and Anna Gray
with their decisive tackling could keep them from
scoring a second goal. We were unlucky up front not
to have got more decisions our way as the umpire was
outrageously crap! He did redeem himself though, by
awarding us a short-corner, but it was sadly
squandered.
A good all-round team performance shocked their
team and coach into thinking that IC ladies now have
a team to be reckoned with. Even IC ladies 1 sts are
worried about the 2nds now.
Rifle &
Pistol
On Saturday December 2, three members of the Pistol
team, Tony Menzies, Tim Griffiths and James Hurr.
Took on a team of seven from Cambridge Revolver
and Pistol Club, shooting Uit Standard (.22).
Despite Cambridge's tactic of refrigerating their
range, Imperial won by a fairly comfortable margin.
We spent the rest of the evening in the pub and
returned to London, arriving at midnight.
