FELIX would never suggest that anarchy should be promoted at Imperial College.
The anarchy page
Under no circumstances should anyone attempt any of the following examples
of anarchy without the supervision of an adult.

•Telephones The College's internal telephone
system is extremely advanced. Wherever there is a
place for technology, there isa e & r t o s ^ l n anarchist
to screw it up. The facilities available on some phones
are beyond belief, if you know somebody with a
phone in their room, you should be able to set an alarm
call on it for 6am without them noticing. Just dial 26
and then the -2* nbbf clock time you require, eg
260600. You can stack the calls up to three deep,
for-8 chance to block most of the network, why not
. phone somebody via almost every system in College?
For * instance dial into the Southside
exchange-94-the.n out-0-then through Evelyn
Gardens-97-and b a c k - 0 - and say the Union
Office. With one call (94097035001 you have blocked
two major networks in the College exchange. Simple
really.
For best effect, why not make somebody's phone
ring elsewhere? Just press the recall button 'R' and
14 followed by the number you wish to receive the
calls from now on, eg R14 3000.
