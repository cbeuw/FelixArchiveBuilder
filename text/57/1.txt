noticeable i n the

the match we made
our f i r s t acquaint-

and "double beef-
steaks", and were
impressed by both.
There took placf
a series of Inter-
national Conferences
at which the Genever
convention was invoked
on a l l possible occa-
sions. These were
held each night i n the
S o c i e t e U Phoenix,
which i s run e n t i r e l y
by the students and
has about 700 members.

was c a l l e d upon to participate. We appreciated par-

Kykin excelled at the cycle races, but we are confident
that the a r t i c l e s of furniture concerned have since been
repaired.. The remaining two Rugger matches had to be
cancelled owing to hard ground, but we played the other
game instead. In the f i r s t match we were losing 1-0
at half-time when our hosts passed round a b o t t l e of

twice i n the next f i v e minutes, but the f i n a l score
was 3-2 against I.C. 'tie gained our revenge i n the second
game. The score stood at 1-1 f o r a long time, but a f t e r
a ding-dong struggle Kitchener clinched the issue with a
35 yards p i l e d r i v e r from a d i f f i c u l t angle, a f t e r a pass-

Hykin and iVeale i n -
dulged i n same s k i l -
f u l inter-passing.
On the f i f t h day
Peacocke went to bed,
i t was rumoured, f o r
the f i r s t time, and
thus missed the v i s i t
to the Oranjebocm
Brewery i n Rotterdam.
This was an unquali-
f i e d success and
everyone was given a
c i g a r e t t e - l i g h t e r and
a warm feeling of bon-
homie to commemorate
i t . The D e l f t
students gave magni-
ficent entertainment
which included, an
o f f i c i a l dinner at
which Hykin and K i t -
chener upheld, the cul-
t u r a l standard of I.C.
with d e l i g h t f u l
speeches i n evidently
understandable Dutch.
A feature of t h i s
dinner was that the
serviettes were set
alight and thrown into
the a i r . At most
Delft E.F.C. Dinners paper tablecloths are s i m i l a r l y
trea-t;edT
The return journey was made i n exhilarating con-
d i t i o n s , and Hykin, i n particular-, seemed to revel i n i t .
Hark Abbott, f o r once, had no comments to make. Those
f i t to do so, "spliced the aainbrace", and, rtraculously,
we returned, to England with only a few s u p e r f i c i a l injuries.
Thank you, D.S.R.C, f o r a wonderful time.
