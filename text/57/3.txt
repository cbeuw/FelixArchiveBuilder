a f t e r taking over as editor of FELIX i n the middle
of l a s t summer term, Mr. D. Kale found himself with a
s t a f f of only three at the beginning of the new session.
But FELIX appeared on the second Friday of the autumn
term and by Christmas he had gathered together almost
a f u l l board. This i s no mean achievement, especially
when one discovers that Mr. Kale turned h i s pen to
recording such diverse a c t i v i t i e s as debates and
carnivals -• and then found time f o r verse. Our thanks
go to him f o r a l l the time he has given to FELIX and
we look forward to receiving contributions from him as
editor em^riti1

A new editor; a new term, i.nd whereas the
autumn term i s regarded by some a time of s e t t l i n g
down to work, the spring term i s thought by some to
be the time when a l l and sundry should play an active
part i n whatever goes on i n the union. At the same time,
those who have managed to get through the autumn term
without bothering about the union, resolve to work even
harder to avoid g e t t i n g involved i n union a c t i v i t i e s .
Their l a c k of i n t e r e s t i s bemoaned by t h e i r more
a c t i v e fellows,but i s there not cause f o r r e j o i c i n g i n
t h e i r non-participation ?
At present, anyone belonging to a few of the
college clubs and s o c i e t i e s gets f a r more value from
the union than h i s f i v e pound subscription. The
difference between value received and money given, i s
e n t i r e l y due to the generosity of the l e s s a c t i v e amongst
as i n not using the whole ( i f any) of t h e i r subscription.
I f the membership of each club were to increase,
i t would be much more d i f f i c u l t to get a place i n a team
(since, because o f the very large number o f non-
p a r t i c i p a n t s at present, there must be quite a few who
would t u r n out to b i more than average players a t the
sport they chose to play.) Gone w i l l be the opportunity
of t r a v e l l i n g on a union subsidy, of enjoying an
afternoon of p l a y i n g the game.
The same applies to an increase i n spectators
•atoning the various college teams do b a t t l e . We could
no longer t r a v e l to Harlington and be c e r t a i n of our
p a r t i c u l a r vantage point f o r some of the best free
entertainment a v a i l a b l e . Kren i n the General Studies
l e c t u r e s , i t would be impossible to o b t a i n the same
pleasure i f 60 % of the college went along. And imagine
the queue f o r t i c k e t s i f everyone decided to o» t o the
hops.
So instead of aeorying the l a c k of enthusiasm ox
Maae benefactors o f the 'union-man' , l e t us wish
them luck i n t h e i r hard work so t h a t , u n l i k e many ox

C L O S E D FOR CLEANING
The Union Lounge, i t has been announced, w i l l be
closed every alternate Friday f o r cleaning and polishing
the f l o o r . This causes slight inconvenience to members,
but i t i s unavoidable. Complaints about t h i s resulted,
two years ago, i n the Executive adopting the p o l i c y " I f
they v.ant i t d i r t y they can have i t d i r t y " , -which i s not
favoured by the present Executive. The choice of Friday
i s inevitable a f t e r a l i t t l e thought. The polishing pro-
Cess takes a certain amount of time, and as the men knock
off at 4
- p.m., the time i s also fixed. After repeated
waxing and polishing i t i s hoped that, a presentable f l o o r
would result i n a short while. New lamps i n the Dining
H a l l are part of the same brightening-up policy.
V I E W P O I N T
Those of you with eyes must have noticed that the
Union has undergone a considerable f a c e i l i f t i ' : g . I t s
walls and c e i l i n g s are brighter, i t s f l o o r cleaner - and
going to be kept clean, and the lamps i n the Lower Dining
H a l l are f a r more useful than they have ever been. Now
the Entrance H a l l s are more i n v i t i n g , the lounge more lounge-
able, and you can see what you are eating 3" the Refectory.
So f a r , so good. Now f o r the c r i t i c i s m .
The Lounge i s a mute creature that suffers i n silence.
Few w i l l deny that i t has a l i f e and personality a l l i t s
own; even fewer that i t i s mute. I t i s nice, warm and
quiet (except during lunchtime and Hop nights) '.vhere one
can s i t , read or Ju3t lounge i n casual comfort. But t h i s
casualness, I f e e l , has gone a b i t too f a r recently, amount-
ing to downright slovenliness. Nothing i s ever i n place,
classes and teacups we f i n d on the f l o o r . Ashtrays s l i p
below the settees, while the ash and matches they 8 "• sup-
posed to contain are strewn a l l over the f l o o r ar,;
~ •!
tables. Newspapers sprawl carelessly on the seatj, \.hile
people are perched uncomfortably on tables. The newspapers
and periodicals come i n f o r r e a l l y heartless treatment, and
i t i s rare to f i n d a magazine more than a few days old with
i t s cover on. Why, WHT, do we have to drop our paper when
we get up? Is i t too much effort to valk a few extra
paces anr" put them on the side tables? No sight i s more
f a m i l i a r i n the Lounge than the student who wanders round
looking f o r a piece of unclaimed printed paper to read.
Returning the papers to t h e i r proper place would reduce the
number of these wanderers, and increase the life-expectancy
of the magazines as they would not then be sat on so much.
The rest of the Union comes i n f o r much the same
treatment. Muddy feet ignore the door-mats as completely
as i f they were not there. And dripping coats wander round
looking at notices, chatting to people, going to the l e t t e r
rack and even to the Dining H a l l before turning to the cloal
room. This sort of treatment i s not deserving of the
Union. I t might be a l l right i n one's own digs, v i s i t e d
perhaps by a maid once a week and by the land-lady once a
month, or when she smells kipper o i l . But please, not i n
the Union, -which i s used by hundreds of others.
Is i t too much to ask that we clean our shoes as we
come i n ; or that we use the ash-trays; or that vre treat
the papers c i v i l l y ? Especially the papers. This i s NOT
regimentation. I t i s not even d i s c i p l i n e . I t i s merely
canmonsense and t i d i n e s s t o be exhibited i n a place that we
frequent so often. Let us be casual, by a l l means. But
l e t us also be t i d y . I t makes l i f e f a r more pleasant.
