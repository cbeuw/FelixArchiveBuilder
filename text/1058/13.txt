.interview/gig: almighty^
By the time you read this, Almighty will have split
up. Now for some of you that may rate as being
about as emotion-inducing as the nearest
Sabbatical election, but for thousands of others
the punk/metal quartet were one of Britain's best
bands. Just before their final European show at
the Shepherd's Bush Empire, Felix caught up
with their affable frontman Ricky Warwick for a
chat over that most expert of conversation insti-
gators - Guinness. So why are Almighty calling it
a day?
"Well, we've done five LPs now. We've defi-
nitely progressed with each record and our latest
LP ('Just Add Life') is our best ever. We could just
carry on for the sake of it, but I like a challenge.
I've already got a new band together and we'll be
playing different stuff than Almighty did."
Ricky was quick to dispel any hopes that they
might ever re-form: 'Almighty will never play
together again. I hate it when bands split-up and
then get back together. The Sex Pistols are die
only band who can get away with ittecauseat the
beginning they were exploiting j
about, 'Cash lor chaos.' [

mean being in favour of the IRA: "I believe in a
united Ireland but not through the IRA The IRA,
like other Marxist organisations, want things done
with their people in power. And the thing that
people don't realise is that Gerry Adams only has
4% ofthe vote in Ireland. The only reason that the
IRA bomb on the British mainland is because they
can't bomb in Ireland because they've got no vote
there."
True enough, but thanks to ignorance and
general stupidity, many Americans don't see it
that way as Ricky explained: "I had the misfor-
tune to be in New York on St. Patrick's Day. I've
never been so patronised in my whole life. Over
there they see it as a freedom fight and people
were coming up to me and saying, 'Isn't it great
what those guys are doing over there?' I was read-
ing an interview the other day with House Of
Pain. They were saying, 'Yeah, we're Irish
Americans; we support the IRA; we support free-
dom fighters everywhere.' So the journalist said to

\ crtheless, if that wasn't quite an almighty
finale, the gig itself served as a fitting epitaph to a
band who had some fine songs.
-album: pantera - the great
southern trendkilLk
Pantera? They're really hard and play loud music,
don't they? Nobody can like all that shouting and
heavy guitars, right? Wrong. Pantera's last album
'Far Beyond Driven' went far beyond expecta-
tions by going straight into the US charts at No. 1
and into the U K charts at No.3, they've sold six
million records worldwide (Blur? Oasis? Don't
make me laugh) and their live shows are one of
the purest adrenaline rushes on musical earth.
Proof enough that people like this stuff...
And with opening numbers like the title
track here, it's not surprising. If you're feeling
remotely disenchanted, angry or even just suffer-
ing from that once-yearly condition of exam
stress, then try putting it on and practising
screaming in unison with Phil Anselmo's fourteen
