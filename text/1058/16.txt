Two tons of fun! Another
evening of double delights, start-
ing at 8pm with the Daily
Telegraph Open M i c Award
Semi-Finals with compere
Boothby Graffoe. That's a total
of 14 acts for just £2.50 / £2,
and if you bring a copy of today's
Telegraph you get a free bottle
of Newcastle Brown.
Then we give up any pre-
tence of credibility and indulge
in the boogie wonderland that is
Shaft. A night full of every-
body's favourite 70's and 80's
sounds to dance away all those
exam worries.
Plus, Trash Aesthetic brings
yon funk, pop and electro on top
of the usual blissed out tunes in
the U D H . . . all for a mere £1,
and it's free before 9.

RCS Union
Biochemistry has elected Abarna
Thiru as next year's Dep Rep.
They went to the ballot a fort-
night ago, and the results have
been accepted by the Elections
Committee. Dr Mitchell, the
R C S U HST, was amused by the
pair of underpants drawn on one
ballot paper.
Physics? Don't talk to me
about Physics! Over Easter their
papers were removed, which
caused all sorts of problems, not
least for the candidates who
were nearly fully seconded - the
Returning Officer had no alterna-
tive but to declare the papers
null and void. A new set was put
up and one different candidate
has stood: M r Hooman Behnia.
Hooman ran for R C S U Vice
President, only being defeated at
the second count by Karl
Condron.
Biology will go to the polls
before this Felix is issued; two
candidates are standing: Eoin
Harris and Yu-Ming Chan, as
well as New Election. Chemistry
has one candidate, David
Robinson, who is certainly going
to be ratified by the Chemistry
student body this week. Maths
has one candidate at present.
As R C S U Handbook Editor,
I really want good student partic-
ipation; articles, photos, A N Y -
T H I N G - to create a good hand-
book which reaches out to the
average student, requires a coor-
dinated, committed team effort.
Last week saw the Colours
Committee meet - I would like
to draw everyone's attention to
the following people, who were
especially mentioned. Thida
Tun, MathsSoc President, has
breathed new life into the
Society. Sean Rands, BioSoc
Chairman, actually resurrected
the Society from extinction dur-
ing the first term of the year.
Sean got his proposals through a
U G M (dominated by Freshers

who would vote for anything,
even for chocolate liqueurs!), and
BioSoc is in excellent health. Dr
Margaret Goodgame, working as
a College Tutor and in the area of
Women's Affairs, is thanked for
her many valuable contributions
to Academic Affairs. The IC
University Challenge team took
part in and won for IC - well
done, lads! Although it has been
noted that Mark Pallen, a
Biochemist, failed to recognise
the structure of glucose, he and
his team were outstanding
nonetheless!

Cycling
National Student 25 mile
Time Trial Championships
IC were in action earlier this
month, competing in a fiercely-
contested championship. The
course outside Oxford is not
known as the fastest in the coun-
try and the two long climbs,
together with a nagging cross-
wind, made the race tough for
all 123 competitors.
Fastest college man on the
day was once more Liam
Maybank with a time of 59:09
(25.4 mph); second fastest was
Duncan Emery, recording 59:37
(25.1 mph). Agis Agisilaou and
Toby, both riding their first 25-
miler, were credited with
1:02:03 (24.2 mph) and 1:09:22
(21.6 mph) respectively.
In the team competition, IC
performed well to take 5th
place. Overall winner on the day
was Olympic Squad member
and full-time cyclist Roger
Hammond with a time of 51:52
(28.9 mph).
IC Cycling club wishes to
express its thanks to Evans
Cycles of Wandsworth for their
continued support.
