News in brief
Rag Failure
Wednesday's Rag Fete turned out
to be something of a non-event
after heavy rain f o r c e d the
Queen's Lawn spectacular into
the M a i n Dining H a l l . W i t h the
festivities taken out of sight and
earshot, ' attendance at the
fundraising occasion was mini-
mal.
A spokesman from the char-
ity Turning Point said, "It's a pity
there aren't any students here...
but we're all holding each other
up." T h e Royal National Lifeboat
Institute, The Imperial Cancer
Research Fund and the
Leukaemia Research Fund also
had stalls, but there were only
around six students visiting, most
of them committed Raggies,
when the event was well under-
way at 3.30pm.
With reference to allegations
earlier this year that the Rag
Chair would not accept responsi-
bility for unsuccessful Rag events,
Jon Lambert told Felix, "Well
you can say I blame this one on
the weather."
Pimlico Finale
An eventful 21st year of the
Pimlico Connection will end next
week as students who went to
the U S A and Israel present their
findings to their sponsors.
Several issues have already
arisen from the trips. In a presen-
tation to BP on Wednesday,
discussions centred on whether
tutors should be paid and
whether the programme should
be expanded to include one-to-
one mentoring.
Commenting on the success-
ful trips, Ian Gregory, Pimlico
Chair, said, "We hope this will
lead to an expansion of students
working in the local community."
Union Elections
Sarah Thomas, City and Guilds
College Union ( C & G C U )
President, has been returned as
next year's I C U Council chair. In
a battle of Constituent College
Union officers, she overcame
competition from her own Vice-
President, Duncan Tindall, and
the Royal College of Science
Union Academic Affairs Officer,
Matt Szyndel.
The elections, held at last
Friday's I C U Annual General
Meeting, saw Anne Ovens, the
current Women's Officer,
confirmed as next year's Welfare
Officer, while Pete Kirtley will
take over the position of
Accommodation Officer.
Nominations have been
reopened for the positions of
Transport and Postgraduate
affairs officers which will now be
elected at the council meeting on
June 6th.
The I C U Annual Report was
also passed with only minor alter-
ations, although with a turnout of
only 50, the I C U President Sarah
White complained at the lack of
response from the students
present. "No-one asked any ques-
tions," she protested.
