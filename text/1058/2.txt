Karrian leaves ULU to
become Labour spindoctor
BY RACHEL WALTERS
The President of the University
of London Union (ULU) has
decided to give up his job this
week.
Ghassan Karrian will take up
a full-time post next Tuesday as
Senior General Election
Campaigns coordinator in the
West London area for the Labour
Party. Although Mr Karrian will
no longer be paid by U L U , he has
not resigned, nor been ousted,
and will keep his official title as
President.
Mr Karrian leaves his posi-
tion in almost as much contro-
versy as when he started. He was
elected to his position last year
amid allegations that he took on
the position merely to further his
political career. Sources at U L U
suggest that there is a large
degree of ill-feeling amongst his
staff and colleagues, and
incredulity that he should leave
so suddenly.
The position will leave U L U
without a President until Sarah
White, I C U President, takes
over in August. Although Sarah
has known of the decision for a
fortnight, Ghassan only informed
his U L U colleagues this week.
Tara Jefferson, U L U Vice
President with responsibility for
union finances, will take over the
running of many of the day-to-
day issues.
A result of M r Karrian's
departure will be the lack of the
customary Sabbatical 'handover'
period. Usually, incoming and
outgoing sabbaticals share a
period in office so that the
incoming sabbatical can be
'shown the ropes'. Mr Karrian's
absence will deprive Sarah of this
training which she would have
received for her Presidential
responsibilities.
"I just don't understand
him," exclaimed Miss White.
She felt that the positive rela-
tionship that she had enjoyed
with her predecessor had
suffered. "I'm cross, because we
were getting on quite well."
Meanwhile, Sarah has been
attempting to salvage some form
of handover before Ghassan
leaves. She has been trying to fit
in as many meetings and intro-
ductions as possible with
University of London staff this
week.
Science Museum gets
£23 million lottery award
BY ANDREW TSENG
"Albertopolis is happening piece-
meal", commented Ian Caldwell,
Imperial College Director of
Estates, on the announcement
that the Science Museum is to
receive £23 million of National
Lottery Money. Monday's grant
was the first major award of
Lottery money to go to the
sciences.
The money will be used as
part of a new £44 million wing
devoted to contemporary
science, technology and medi-
cine. Due to open in 2000, the
Wellcome Wing will include four
floors of new exhibition space
and the first 3D I M A X film
theatre in London.
The award comes almost a
year after the Albertopolis
proposal was thrown out by the
Millenium Commission. The
proposal would have created a
huge pedestrian precinct and
underground shopping mall
around the South Kensington
area.
Coming after last week's
grant of £40 million to the Royal
Albert Hall, the award provides
increasing evidence that the
spirit of Albertopolis, the rejuve-
nation of the South Kensington
area is taking place without a
Millenium grant.
Mr Caldwell was upbeat
about the Science Museum
money. Speaking to Felix, he
suggested that if anything,
Imperial's chances of getting
lottery funding would be
enhanced by the award. Imperial
is about to embark on two
projects that could be considered
for grants: the addition of two
floors to the library and the
extension of the Sports Centre.
In a related development, a
new South Kensington coordina-
tion group is to be created. The
group, containing representatives
from Imperial College, the Royal
Albert Hall and the Museums,
will enable South Kensington
institutions to work more effec-
tively together. Its formation
follows the discovery that plans
to excavate the Royal Albert
Hall's steps were due to start on
the same day that the
Department of Biology was to
move out of the Beit Building.
The group meets for the first
time today.
Terry Briley retires from Security
BY THE NEWS TEAM
The outgoing deputy head of
security Terry Briley, and his
wife Joy, were given a farewell
send off at Imperial College
Union on Monday. Mr Bnley
retired from his position earlier
this year after taking some time
off work through ill-health.
Originally from Cork, Terry
had served in the police force
until taking up the position of
Deputy head of Security in
1986. Reknowned for his
substantial repartee of police
anecdotes and fiercely proud of
his Irish heritage, Terry had been
popular with staff and students
alike.
Reminiscing about his time
here, and paying particular trib-
ute to Security Guard Vic
Turner, who died last week, he
spoke of his committment to
'looking after' IC undergradu-
ates. "I will always say that
Imperial should be here for the
students, and they were my first
priority," he said. "Perhaps I
didn't do as much admin as
everyone would have liked, but I
never thought that it was impor-
tant."
His enthusiatic service to IC
was paid tribute to by members
of ICU, the College Press Office,
and also by P C Clive Coleman,
who came representing Kensing-
ton and Chelsea constabulary.
Mr Briley has asked Felix to
pass on his thanks to all who
organised the event. PHOTO; RACHEL WALTERS
