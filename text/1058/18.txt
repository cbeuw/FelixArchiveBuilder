calculating?
Dear Felix,
I would like to reply to the com-
ments in Eric Chan's letter on the
subject of calculators in examina-
tions. Over the summer, the col-
lege examining board decided that
students will no longer be allowed
to take their own calculators into
examinations. Students were not
consulted about this decision, as it
is considered inappropriate for
there to be a student presence on
the examining board. The possibil-
ity of student representation on this
board in the future is remote,
unless we see rioting in all major
departments. Student opinion on
this change has since been heard
by senior college staff at the acad-
emic affairs half day and at various
college committees.
Departments have dealt with
this change in college policy in dif-
ferent ways. Most have chosen a
model of calculator which they pro-
vide for their students in examina-
tions. The model of calculator
varies, leading to some difficulties
in humanities examinations. The
calculator issued by humanities is
not necessarily the calculator
issued by your department.
In my opinion, the idea of
issuing students with a standard
calculator is a fair one. I personal-
ly would not like to think that I was
at a disadvantage in an exam
because other people can afford to
buy a better calculator than I can,
particularly if the advantage that
they gained was due to a full set of
lecture notes in the memory of
their 'calculator' I have been led
to believe that departmental
libraries stock your department's
choice of calculator for you to bor-
row and get used to.
I do find it disappointing that
students were not consulted on this
matter. It is a shame that college
did not include the union book-
store in the bulk purchase deal that
they no doubt procured. However I
expect that college will be keen to
address problems arising from this
change in policy.

Dear Rachel,
Calculators in Examinations.
Your correspondence page sug-
gests that you might welcome fur-
ther information on the change in
College policy over the use of cal-
culators in examinations.
At meetings in autumn 1995
the two principal Committees of
Examiners which oversee under-
graduate examinations decided
that it was no longer appropriate
to continue with the current
arrangements. This was because
there was concern that students
with certain types of machines
might enjoy an unfair advantage
because of the increasing difficul-
ties in monitoring the sophisticated
calculators now available (pro-
grammable ability, alpha-numeric
capability, large memory facility
and the ability for calculators in the
same room to communicate).
Instead it was decided that, from
the summer term examinations,
calculators would be provided by
the College in accordance with the
requirements of each department.
For obvious reasons, Boards of
Examiners are one of the very few
committees at IC which do not
enjoy student representation.
Once, however, the policy decision
was taken the Registry moved
swiftly to consult departments on
their preferred make and model of
calculator. Each department was
free to choose independently of
other departments, though, in
practice, two models only were
chosen college-wide which
allowed for bulk buying. Each
department had its stock of calcu-
lators available to them in January
1996, at the beginning of the
spring term, allowing plenty of
time for students to practise on the
model chosen by their department.
Yours sincerely,
F V McClure
Academic Registrar
It is certainly the case that the
scope for cheating with the
supercalculators was very great
and something had to be done.
As for student consultation.
Matt, that's a forlorn hope. Thin
end of the wedge, my boy, bad
for discipline.
Jeliglitkil?
Dear Rachel,
In Felix 1056, you suggested in the
first instance that Security Officers
slept whilst on duty, and later stat-
ed that there are "plenty of
absolutely delightful security staff'.
Security staff are entitled to
scheduled breaks, this is not to say
that they sleep during this time. As
for not being paid enough, that is
not for you to comment on but the
responsibility of the individual offi-
cer.
You also mentioned "not chal-
lenged enough". You, Rachel,
could not begin to comprehend the
various jobs and duties we under-
take, perhaps you would like to
join us on a 72 hour shift and see
if your views are the same on com-
pletion of that duty. We try to
undertake our duties in the most
professional way we can, taking
into account the circumstances at
the time, at the end of the day we
have to make a decision.
I would now like to answer Mr
Simon Baker (issue 1057). First of
all the V & A does not house or
exhibit '1 942 Stormtrooper outfits'.
Perhaps you use the same
researcher as 'Richard & Judy' or
did you do it all by yourself?
Closure of the Falmouth gates
at 11 pm - they are closed for two
reasons, the left hand pedestrian
gate was closed originally to allow
noise to be kept to an acceptable
level when passing the private flats
opposite 170 Queens Gate.
Closure of the gates at midnight in
my experience would only raise the
noise level by people using it as a
short cut from bar areas such as
Southside and Beit Quad. The right
hand gate was closed when the
Library building work began to
prevent accidents.
Whilst writing, I would like to
take the opportunity to thank you
for the article on the tragic loss of
Vic Turner, who will be sadly
missed by us all.
Yours sincerely
Gary Gray
May I congratulate you on your
encyclopaedic knowledge of the
V & A collection. The article
should have read "from the
1942 Stormtrooper at C & A col-
lection." Methinks your love of
this great museum led you to
miss the point slightly. The
question of pay was specula-
tion, not given as fact, but I
must agree with you on the
challenge and variety of the
job. The fact remains that some
of your staff are sometimes
plain rude to students. As for
the gates, if you wanted to pre-
vent accidents due to the build-
ing work, why not seal it all off?
poor library
Dear Felix,
You are quite right that, in com-
parison with Oxford, and to a
much less extent with Cambridge,
expenditure on libraries in College,
44 out of 100, according to the
Good Universities Guide, is rather
poor. The situation is even worse
since the figures for Oxbridge
exclude expenditure on books pub-
lished in the UK: under the legal
deposit scheme they receive these
free. Lavish spending on libraries is
supported out of their endowments
and, in addition, HEFCE gives Â£1.1
million per annum to the Bodleian
and to Cambridge under the non-
formula funding arrangement to
cover the additional costs created
by their legal deposit status.
When you look at the rest of
the field, IC is the third best, fol-
lowing the two specialist Social
Sciences institutions, LSE and the
University of Buckingham, which
regard their libraries as labs.
Nevertheless, it would be foolish to
be complacent. The British Library
is cutting thousands of current
periodicals, so resources in London
will be greatly diminished. As for
electronic publications, they cost
extra for site licences and equip-
ment and expert staff to run them.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs Magda Czigany
Director of Library and Audio-
Visual Services
I was surprised at the low rat-
ing, having used the library a
lot recently. Cambridge do
have the upper hand in one
respect. They've just banned
mobile phones from all their
libraries. Please take note.
Letters may be edited for
length. Deadline for letters
in Felix 1059: midday,
Tuesday 28th May
