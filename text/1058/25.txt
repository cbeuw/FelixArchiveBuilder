all his fellow specialists to prove him wrong he would know without doubt that he
is standing on an undermined sand cliff which is ready to crumble with him. How
then for the one who makes statements about the specialities of others?
Judge the Qur'an scientifically ?
One will be surprised to learn that such a scientific approach has been commanded
in the Qur'an with the objective of ascertaining its truthfulness.
Do they not carefully consider (investigate) the Qur'an or are there locks
upon their hearts. [Surah 47:24]
Do they not carefully analyse the Qur'an. If it had been from other than
Allah then surely they would have found many discrepancies therein [Surah
4:82]
So religious (that is Islamic) beliefs are not based upon blind acceptance, contrary
to the commonly held view applied to all religions including the Qur'an and Islam.
This has been the experience of Europe in the past 300-400 years in which
scientific advancement and its findings were seen as heretical, its proponents
ridiculed and often exiled and tortured. Islam, has never had that experience.
It is true that peoples academic capabilities differ and thus some will be unable to
ascertain the truth of it and therefore may accept it blindly. But again they have the
opportunity to ask the people of knowledge, those who are in a position to make
such a judgement, like those quoted above. It is from the principles of wisdom and
justice that when you don't know you don't make a judgement yourself but rather
consult one who is in a position to do so. In fact this is something Allah has also
commanded:
So ask the People of Knowledge if you do not know [Surah 21:7]
and He (Allah) has also said
And those who have been given Knowledge know that that which has been
revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth [Surah 34:6]
