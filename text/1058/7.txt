EURO ' 9 6 SPECIAL FELIX FRIDAY MAY 24TH 1 9 9 6 . SEVEN
He is arguably the finest live stand-up come-
dian in the country. 'Comedian extraordi-
naire' Bob Mills is undoubtedly Britain's Mr
Funny Man, and he's come up with the ulti-
mate antidote to anyone who would dream
of taking it all too seriously. Bob's latest
offering, The Alternative Guide... Bluff your
way through Euro '96, will run rings
round the football-bore.
Bob's well known on the London
cabaret circuit, at such venues as the
famous Comedy Store and Jongleurs,
and has appeared on numerous televi-
sion shows. But it is his love of football
that Bob Mills is most appreciated for.
The Alternative Guide... is put together
by EURO 96™ sponsor 'Coca-Cola'. It
takes a light-hearted look at the teams,
players, terrace banter, chants and
amazing soccer trivia as football-fever
sweeps England as we play host to the
biggest event since the World Cup.
The Alternative Guide... Bluff your way
through EURO 96™ contains every-
thing you need to know, and quite a lot
you didn't, to help you get the most out
this feast of football.
So if you're a bit iffy on your foreign
teams, and can't tell a great Dane from
a dud Czech, The Alternative Guide...
has it covered. If you want to brush up on
the history of the tournament itself, there is
a whole section about the teams, the play-
ers and the stories which made the head-
lines. And if you just want to hurl abuse from
the comfort of your armchair, there are a
few key phrases to get you started.
