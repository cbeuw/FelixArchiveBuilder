In two weeks time me, and many of my breed,
will lock ourselves into our dimly lit rooms armed
only with copious amounts of beer, Cheesy
Wotsits and a remote control.
Why? The second best footy competition in the known
universe is just around the corner. Euro '96 promises to be
a sports addicts dream, featuring fifteen teams (plus
Scotland) all after one thing: European glory.
You would have to be an old man to have last watched
England succeed, infinitely old in fact, as the best we've
ever done is a spectacularly grim third. The question is:
'can we do it this year?'

ITALY
How can you bet against a side that can sim-
ply ignore the likes of Franco Baresi, Roberto
Baggio.Costacurta and even the fourteen mil-
lion pound man Gianluca Vialli, all four being
easily good enough to play for I.C. thirds?
Coach Arrigo Sacchi could well be the luckiest
manager alive. Italy, however, have been
known to idle along in this competition, even
failing to qualify in 1992, but many have a
feeling it won't be like that this year. To sum
up, Italy will kick ass. win a big trophy, and
Ravanelli will score loads of goals.

What can you say about good old Blighty?
They're a bit dull, about as good going forward
as a Porsche 911 in reverse gear, and...
crrn... they're a bit dull as well. Anyone, like
me, who has watched England recently, and
has had a little chuckle to themselves when
Jimmy Hill has given them 8 out of 10 will
agree. Of course I may be wrong...
G E R M A N Y
'The Germans play football like they build their
cars: stylish and eminently reliable. Mr
Sugars' b§St mate Jurgen misses the first fix-
ture through suspension, but will inevitably
feature in later games. The only hiccup will be
the forced absence of their midfield rock,
Moller, bringing speculation in the press of a
return of the legendary veteran Lothar
Matthaus.

These guys have been a bit out of sorts late-
ly* o n
ly J u s t
managing to qualify for the tour-
nament, but a quick glance at the talent avail-
able to Head-coach Gus Hiddmk and you
realise why they are the tournament
favourites. Even without their Ajax Wonderkid
Patrick Kleuvert (who is currently facing a
prison sentence) the Dutch exude class, and
will be expected to do well.
