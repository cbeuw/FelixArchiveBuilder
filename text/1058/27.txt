teachings.
The Qur'an is unrivalled in its recording and preservation. The astonishing fact
about this book of Allah is that it has remained unchanged even to a dot, over the
past 1400 years. The Qur'an deals with man and his ultimate goal in life, its
teachings cover all areas of this life and life after death. It contains principles,
doctrines and directions for every sphere of human life. The theme of the Qur'an
broadly consists of three fundamental ideas: Absolute Monotheism,
Messengership, and the life after death. The success of human beings on this earth
and in the life hereafter depends upon obedience to the Qur'anic teachings.

Note: A l l quotes have been taken from a video in which after having been
presented with the statements in the Qur'an and Hadeeth and given the chance to
investigate, the various scientists were questioned as to their opinion regarding the
Qur'an. Their response was recorded live. The video is called "The Truth" and is
available from the Islamic Society upon request. If you would like to know more
