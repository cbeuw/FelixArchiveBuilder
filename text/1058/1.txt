Labour party will
abolish grants
BY RACHEL WALTERS
The Labour Party revealed this
week that it would abolish
parental support for undergradu-
ates and install a wider system of
student loans.
Reversing its long-standing
support for student grants, the
education spokesman David
Blunkett announced plans this
week that his party would install
a privately funded £2.4 billion-a-
year loans scheme that would
leave students repaying their
undergraduate debt for twenty
years. The repayment would be
charged through National
Insurance contributions once
students were earning more than
the national average wage.
The announcement comes in
the wake of the policy U-turn of
the National Union of Students
over Easter. The N U S abolished
its committed campaign to have
student grants to be returned to
their 1979 levels. Jim Murphy,
NUS president, said, "The Union
is in favour of a fair system of
contribution from students who
have benefited from higher
education if this means that
students will have enough money
to live on and will have a fair and
balanced scheme for repayment
relation to their income."
The Labour Party proposals
have also received guarded
support from the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals,
who have long advocated remov-
ing students' dependency on
parental contributions. But they
expressed regret that the policy
statement did not accept that
"payment of tuition fees has to
shift from the taxpayer to the
individual."
The policy document also
supported the principle of
widening access to universities,
but there was no commitment to
giving higher education any
increased funding.
The independent committee
set up to review higher education
funding, led by Sir Ron Dearing
met for the first time on
Tuesday. David Blunkett's paper
indicated that the details of his
proposals would be finalised by
this inquiry.

Sir Marcus Fox, the Chairman
of the. Conservative Back-
benchers' 1922 Committee,
spoke to IC Consoc on
Wednesday, reminiscing over
his long political career. Sir
Marcus told of his experiences
as the 'ordinary' backbencher's
representative.
He described Margaret
Thatcher as 'a wonderful Prime
Minister'. Though he later
admitted that, "I did think, to
be honest, that she stayed on a
little, bit too long."
In relating the meteoric rise
of John Major, Sir Marcus
described his initial impressions
of the Prime Minister when
interviewing him as a Lambeth
councillor. He talked of an
interview panel that was very
impressed by Mr Major, adding
that, "If I had known he would
have passed me, in promotion as
fast as he did, I would have held
him back."
Sir Marcus went on to
discuss the difficulty of 'healing
the divisions' of the Tory back-
bench when the party has a
Commons majority of just one.
His Eurosceptical stance came
particularly to the fore with his
insistence that 'Europe is our
biggest problem', and criticism
of the 'pettifogging directives
[that] impinge on our way of
life.'
