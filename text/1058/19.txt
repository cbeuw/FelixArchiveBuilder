A couple of weeks ago I wrote an
editorial in which I proffered the
opinion that the public face of
IC was badly let down by a few
staff who could have perhaps
brushed up on their customer
care a fraction. It was perhaps a
little cynical, but quite frankly
the suggestion that some of the
catering staff are a little rude,
and some of the security guards a
little grumpy is not a particularly
outlandish viewpoint to express.
Nonetheless, I have since
received an unprecedented
amount of response, some quite
supportive, but most expressing
the opinion that I had no right to
say such things. I felt reasonably
cowed by it all: there are quite a
few folk at IC who can do rather
a good line in making you feel
that you can't possibly know
what you're talking about
because you're only a student.
How the hell have we managed
to find ourselves at a college
where you can't complain or crit-
icise at all?
It's perhaps typical of the
way so many things happen here
that the issue of caculators in
exams should only reach public
debate now, when the issue is
implimented. It really does seem
that this is a case of 'mummy
knows best' because standardis-
ing the calculators that students
use must surely be sensible. But
none the less it seems tragic that
the undergraduate response is
the usual mournful "Well we
don't have any choice". Matt
Szyndel reckons that it would
take 'rioting in all the major
departments' for the college
authorities to pay any attention
to student opinion, and I suspect
he may be right.
This particular issue may not
be a case of gross injustice but
there are plenty of examples of
cavalier disregard of student
interest that go by unchecked.
Somehow we've got ourselves
into a situation where they're
automatically right, always,
because we are the students. Be-
sides, they've got the money, so
what are we going to do about it?
The editorial in this week's
edition of Gair Rhydd, the
Cardiff student newspaper,
expresses student concerns
about the college registry, who
appear to have had a few prob-
lems sorting out the new exam
timetables. It's vitriolic approach
made me realise that Felix is in
fact very tame. But I wonder
what their college authorities say
about it?
