modified his own textbook on the subject. He incorporated all the relevant
Qur'anic passages and authentic statements of the Prophet Muhammad into his
book, The Developing Human, 1987, which is a standard university textbook in
the United States. The book now contains passages of the Qur'an and the Hadeeth
(verified statements of the Prophet Muhammad) for every stage of development
and Professor Moore has also adopted the classification used in the above two
sources.
Upon being presented with hadeeths (verified statements of the Prophet
Muhammad) concerning dominant and recessive characteristics Joe Leigh
Simpson (Professor of Obstretics and Gynaecology, Northwestern University
Medical School, Chicago, Illinois, USA) said: "... these Hadeeths could not have
been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available at the
time of the 'writer'... It follows that not only is there agreement between genetics
and religion (Islam) but in fact religion (Islam) may guide science by adding
revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches... There exist
statements in the Qur'an shown centuries later to be valid which support
knowledge in the Qur'an having been derivedfrom God".
Consider also the statement of T.V.N. Persaud (Professor and Head, Dept. of
Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Manitoba, Canada):
"Muhammad was a very ordinary man, he couldn't read, didn't know how to
write, in fact he was an illiterate... we're talking about 1400 years ago, you have
some illiterate person making profound statements that are amazingly accurate,
of a scientific nature... I personally can't see how this could be mere chance, there
are too many accuracies and like Professor Moore I have no difficulty in my mind
reconciling that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which lead him to these
statements".
