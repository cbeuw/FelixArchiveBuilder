Letters. FELIX, Friday February 20th 1987 2
Criminal
Botha
Dear Dave,
I write in response to Mike's letter
(FELIX 763) concerning his support
of Mr. Goosen and his South African
government's incursions into
neighbouring states. I am sure there
are many more poeple who are just
as ignorant about the situation in
Southern Africa as Mike is.
To me, the application of the phrase
"supporting terrorism," in his letter
when referring to South Africa's
neighbouring states was not only
improper but misleading as well, and
therefore, needs correction here.
Those the South African regime has
labelled "terrorists" do not live in
neighbouring states nor are they
trained there. What these innocent
states do harbour are defenceless
refugees who have escaped from
Botha's "Soweto Jail" in search of
freedom. Indeed, all Botha's past
attacks on his neighbours have been
targetted at refugee camps, maiming
every resident—child or aged. Surely,
to support a regime which commits
such unforgivable acts of agression
would be ignorance of the highest
order which cannot be left
unchallenged. To accommodate a
refugee is no crime and I strongly
believe there is no country in the
world, today, that does not harbour
any.
To have an ANC office in a
neighbouring state is not different
from having one inside South Africa
itself. Winnie Mandela and Bishop
Tutu live in South Africa, yet they
still openly oppose the racist
government just as Oliver Tambo
does across the borders. Nelson
Mandela has openly declared he shall
live nowhere but in Johannesberg,
where his home once was, yet the
South African government has,
before, "offered" him freedom on
the condition that he went to live in
one of the neighbouring states while
negotiations are on. Surely, if they
knew his presence in a neighbouring
state would be a threat could they
have made the offer? Why would
Botha rather have Mandela abroad
than home? Only part of the answer
is these questions are useful to the
subject at hand: Botha has always
found it easier to pursue and murder
black South Africans abroad than at
home. In the former case there is a
loophole—he claims they are
terrorists being harboured by his
neighbours and in the majority of
these atrocities he has managed to
receive a sympathetic ear from his
worshippers. In the latter (for which
the Sharpville Massacre is an
example) he has received no cover-
up, not even from his own henchmen!
His choice, therefore remains
obvious.
When Germany once dominated
Europe with her military supremacy,
Europeans reacted and Hitler paid a
price for it. Similarly, I believe,
people in Southern Africa will react
and Botha will do likewise. I hope the
ANC will remember to put the
world's "No. 1 criminal" (Botha) in
a cage in a history museum
somewhere in Soweto when it comes
to power. I am sure that will attract
tourists from all over the world—I
will be there!

In God he
trusts
Dear Sir,
I recently read a letter in FELIX
complaining about the appointment of
a gay and lesbian officer to the Union
Council, and the reply to it.
The letter basically pointed out that
gays and lesbians are just one of many
minorities in the College, and the
reply insisted that people need to be
enlightened to accept homosexuality
as normal.
As I read these letters, and many
others like them elsewhere, I was
really saddened. There seem to be so
many people insisting that their way
is right. So many people pressing for
one cause or another, with no time to
listen to anyone else. The desire to
stamp their own ethics on society, and
to have them accepted. And I can
understand that the motive behind this
is a concern for the individuality of
each person. A concern for the
freedom of individuals. And inside
every person is a frustrated yearning
for freedom—freedom from
everything that suppresses them or
holds or ties them down. But how
much room have people left in all this
for God? He's been dismissed almost
without exception, without a
moment's thought. "Oh, I don't
believe in God." And that's it out of
the way. But what if he did have
something to say? What if, despite
however untrendy it might be, God
did actually exist? And, not only
exist, but actually really care? I read
recently an article in 'New Society'
on London's down and outs in the
cold freeze of last month; it
concluded:
"And yet, and yet...disgusting,
smelly, noisy, nauseous, drunk and
drugged, the raggle-taggle army of
Piccadilly ne'er-do-wells, rentboys,
dossers, tramps, feckless, homeless
and jobless who briefly swamped St.
James's Church were all these things,
but the scenes on the floor of the
church were also weirdly moving.
There was something very odd about
the contrast between the beauty of the
Wren church and the misshapen
human beings who came in from the
cold. Something troubling and
disturbing for the contemporary
atheistic mind. Something you could
almost call—the nearest thing to a
dirty word in 1987—holy."
New Society, 30th Jan. 1987
What if, what if? I wonder how
many people really honestly ask that
question? How many people, in all the
striving for acceptance, striving for
identity, for joy, for freedom, how
many everyday people, like you and
me, ask? What if?
God does care, more than we could
ever dream of. Not only does he care,
he really hurts when he sees us
desperately chasing after vain
expressions of love and freedom, and
sees us destroying ourselves. When
we turn our backs on him, and just
dismiss him with that arrogance "Oh,
I don't believe," his heart weeps for
us. If only we had just the vaguest
notion of who God really is, and what
he's been through for us in Jesus, it
would break every one of us. Just the
smallest glimpse of his awesome
power, of his purity and holiness. Of
the depth, the depth of his love for
each one of us as an individual
person...if only, we'd cry out to him.
But people are so content just to go
on, without ever coming face to face
with the possibility that maybe, just
maybe, they're wrong. Maybe, just
maybe there's a God waiting for each
one of us to turn round and find him
there. Just waiting for us to reach out
and touch him, to cry out to him from
the bottom of our hearts. He's so
longing for us to. And the irony of
it all is that the very love, freedom
joy, identity, fulfilment etc. that we're
all so busy striving for, is found right
there, in Jesus, whom we so casually
dismissed in the first place.
And that's what really saddened me
when I read those letters. If only...

The sound of
silence
Dear Dave,
We would like to make a protest
about the IC Union policy for letting
rooms in the Union Building for
parties; in particular the City and
Guilds Dinner Dance held on the
morning of Saturday, February 7th.
At 3 o'clock in the morning we and
many other residents of Beit Hall
were woken by the start of the party
which was destined to continue until
6.00am. Two sets of windows, Beit
Hall pillows and a mere 25 feet of
fresh air could not deaden the noise
to any great extent!
Parties which end at 1.30 or 2.00
in the morning as Beit residents who
do not wish to attend may go out and
seek other entertainment or rest
assured that the noise will go away
sometime. However, at three in the
morning no one is in the mood to seek
other non-existent diversions and nor
is the noise likely to go away at any
reasonable hour.
We are not saying that such early
morning parties should not be held,
merely that they should be put in
rooms not less than 100 yards from
the nearest sleeping student. Surely
in the future efforts can be made to
use rooms in the Sherfield Building
or even on the left hand side of the
Union Building, which has similar
rooms to those so close to our own
windows; then the noise can only
disturb empty offices or the shrubbery
in the Life Sci. Building.

Extreme
Allen
Dear Sir,
I am writing in reply to Mike
Allen's letter in last week's FELIX
(No. 763) expressing his view that
terrorism should be fought by killing
its perpetrators.
I would like to ask Mr Allen just
what is his objection to terrorism. It
is obviously not that it has a low
regard for human life: Mr Allen
plainly shares this attitude.
Furthermore, his opposition cannot be
due to the fact that terrorists are
prepared to go to such lengths to
achieve their aims, and are therefore
'extremists': Mr Allen is also, by this
definition, an extremist.
His only justification for the views
expressed in his letter must be a
childishly simplistic 'goodies and
baddies' philosophy which leads him
to believe that any ideology
disagreeing with his own should be
annihilated. This argument is exactly
that used by the terrorists themselves
to attempt to justify their actions.
Mr Allen's statement that "if our
forces withdrew (from Northern
Ireland) this violence would no doubt
escalate" is shortsighted in the
extreme. Any attempt to "track these
murderers down and kill them" as he
continued on page 4.
