New College 2nds 1,
IC 3rds 5
Thirds'
revenge
Saturday's emphatic win at New
College brought a third successive
win for the in-form IC 3rds. Having
beaten second-in-the-table Guys lsts
2-1, with a gutsy and determined
display, and New College 2nds by a
similar scoreline, the 3rds travelled
to the scene of their recent cup defeat,
hoping to achieve their first double.
On a very heavy pitch IC were slow
to get into their stride and New
College forced the earlier openings
but failed to take advantage. We soon
took control with slick first-time
passing down both flanks. Pressure
paid off when Wendel Charles' shot
was deflected off a defender to find
the back of the net. Moments later,
New College's goalkeeper patted out
a corner, and Mark Woodgate.
lurking on the edge of the box. headed
just over. The second goal was
vintage football; a precision four-man
move down the right found Mark
Radley in space. Hisfiercecross-shot
was turned in by the sliding Mike
Housby, to make the half-time score
m
2-0. Not surprisingly New College
rallied for an early second-half goal
but the aerial domination by Martin
Lake, ably supported by the fast
covering slide tackles of Mark
Woodgate ensured New College
didn't trouble keeper Mike Kemp.
Both full-backs Russ Dark and Martin
Dixon assisted in arguably our best
attacking display this season. Mike
Plummer's consistent breaks down
the left ruthlessly demoralized the
New College fullback whose tackles
seemed close to desperation as well
as somewhat ineffective. A
determined Mike Plummer run and
cross found Paul Thompson whose
fierce six-yard volley whistled past a
static New College keeper. Our
opponents responded well with a swift
counter attack and finely-struck
consolation goal. Any 3rds
complacency vanished and a lightning
move found Mike Housby in space
but his clever chip was acrobatically
turned over. A fine sole goal by
Wendel Charles made it 4-1.
Breaking from a corner, Wendel
received the ball on the half-way line,
powered past two defenders who
embarrassingly lacked pace, to
delightfully clip the ball over a
bewildered New College keeper.
Minutes later Mike Housby and Mike
Plummer rounded the keeper and
side-footed home.
Midfield dynamos Paul Thompson
and Kevin Graves battled hard to deny
New College space. Indeed. Kevin,
so dominant in the Cup game, had no
chances, but with everyone else
demonstrating lethal finishing, it
didn't matter.
A stark constrast to our last visit
here; creating fewer chances but
every one decisive. A fine display of
attacking football, hopefully to
continue in subsequent games.
Team: Mike Kemp, Martin Dixon,
Mark Woodgate (Capt), Martin Lake,
Russ Dark, Paul Thompson, Kevin
Graves, Mike Plummer, Mark Redley,
Wendel Charles, Mike Housby.
Sailing
IC vs Bath and Oxford
Saturday 14th and
Sunday 15th February
Double
victory
For yet another weekend in a row, IC
sailing team had a very successful
outing. The challenge this week came
from Bath, but on arriving at their
home reservoir, we discovered that
Oxford had also sent their team to try
and break our streak of unbeaten
matches.
The first match to be sailed was
against Bath and Richard Brimlow's
daring but excellent starting tactics in
the first and second races, led
Imperial to resounding wins. In the
third race IC made the mistake of not
taking their opposition seriously and
were punished by losing the race. The
final score, 2-1 gave the match to
Imperial.
A more serious challenge was
posed by Oxford who even recruited
two American sailors in an attempt to
strengthen their side. But their
unprecedented aggression on the start
line, found its match in Apostolos
Leouidhopoulos. who hadn't smoked
for a week. It was a tough match and
the aggression resulted in Richard
Jarman needing a physiotherapist
after a minor h-^ck injury. The match
was finally ,.. IC which shows
that aggressive opponents get the best
out of our team. Future opponents
beware!
Team: R Brimlow, Charles,
Apostolos Leouidhopoulos, R Jarman
S Page, A Stork, A Burrows, Jenny.

IC II 2, St. Mary's 0
Eventual
Success
A beautiful sunny day at Harlington
saw another changed IC II's team gain
another valuable two points for their
promotion bid. However, even the
most ardent of their fans were
contemplating retiring to the bar by
half time, due to the appallingly
boring, goalless first half. In fairness
the IC defence was excellent, and S
Gordon was working hard and
effectively in attack. However, the
midfield had so far been
unimaginative and poor in their
passing execution.
The second half started where the
first left off, and then after 20 minutes
IC woke up. Buckley. Keelim and
McDonald started causing problems
down the right. Barrow also began to
get forward and it was his low curling
free kick which led to an innovative
dummy by Gordon, leaving
Bioekhuizen to flick the ball into the
net.
Inspired by this. IC kept up the
pressure and their control on the
game. The two points were safely
ensured when D Semeiria headed
across the goal and Keelin came
flying in at the far post and although
his shot was helped into the net by a
defender he was dubiously given the
credit for the goal.
Team: J Wreford, N McDonald,
S Dunthorne, S Laverick, J
Holland, M Barrow, A Keelin, K
Buckley, D Semeiria, S Gordon,
N. Broekhuizen. Man of the
match: S Gordon.
Hyde Park Relay
Run inthe
Park
Those of you who were around the
Union last weekend would probably
have noticed the 1100 runners or so
present at this year's relay. As
always, the standard was very high
with most of the top student runners
present although an unfortunate clash
with the women's National meant
some of the better women were
absent. The men's race was won by
Loughborough University in 84min
Msec, ahead of Oxford and West
London IHE. Imperial were back in
54th place though half the 6-man team
also ran for London University,
which finished a creditable 8th despite
a weakened team.
Altogether, 117 men's teams
•completed the course as well as 28
guest teams including Nat West Bank
who were first across the line in
84-06. The guest teams also included
some well known athletes such as
Dave Clarke, who clocked the fastest
individual time of 13-17, and Nick
Rose. For the official teams, 5
seconds separated the five fastest
individuals with S Newport of West
London IHE being quickest at 13-32.
Ex-IC runner Sam Carey was third
fastest in 13-34.
In the women's race, Oxford turned
the tables on Loughborough, winning
by 20 seconds in 58-42. This followed
the disqualification of Leeds who
finished 2 seconds ahead of Oxford
but had one runner doing two legs.
The fastest individual was London's
Lisa Webb who covered the 2 mile
loop in 11-18.
Many thanks to all those who
helped on the day
