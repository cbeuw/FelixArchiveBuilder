example, Max Born is officially
credited to Great Britain, although he
was born in Germany, was educated
there, and conducted his prize-
winning research in Gottingen, ten
years before he emigrated. Similarly,
the physicists TD Lee and CN Yang
are credited to China, however, both
were educated and did their research
in the United States. Imperial
College's favourite physicist, Erwin
Schrodinger, whose centenary will
shortly be celebrated here, was forced
to flee from Austria to work in Dublin
in the prewar years, but was credited
to Austria. (Incidentally,
Schfodinger's personal life caused
raised eyebrows in staunchly Catholic
Ireland; he lived happily in a menage
a trois).
The Nobel Foundation also allows
multiple "claiming" of Nobel
Laureates by academic institutions. A
laureate may be claimed by the
institution at which he did his
undergraduate work, by the one at
which he obtained his doctoral
degree, and some institutions can
even claim a laureate if he studied
there without actually getting a
degree. A postdoctoral year or two
will also suffice in most cases.
Membership of a faculty, from
research assistant to professor, can be
recognised as a legitimate connection.
The recipient's presence at an
institution at the time of the award is
another justification for a claim to a
laureate. At the end of the laureate's
career, he may take a visiting
professorship, bringing glory to yet
another seat of learning.
As a consequence of all this
eagerness to be associated with the
scientific greats, situations develop
such as that in the United States,
where one hundred laureates are
claimed by nearly two hundred
institutions. One extreme case, that of
the biochemist Fritz Lipmann, shows
him to be counted amongst the staff
of eleven universities, colleges, and
institutes. This somewhat farcical
situation is recognised as something
of an embarrassment, and many
institutions qualify their claims at
length. However, some compound
their embarrassment. The College of
the City of New York has given a
prize to Arthur Kornberg, its first
alumnus to win a Nobel Prize,
probably the first time anyone has
been awarded a prize for winning a
prize. In order to contain this
overzealousness, in some areas self-
denying rules have come into force
to limit the number of laureates
claimed. Harvard does not list its
alumni laureates, nor does it count
those that have briefly meandered
through its corridors before obtaining
their prizes. The reasoning behind
multiple laureate claims can be seen
in the example of the Rockerfeller
Institute. When one of its members
suggested that the institute may be
coasting, a member of the Board
indignantly retorted that "an institute
which has had nine scientists win the
Nobel Prize in the last five years
doesn't sound to me like an institute
that's coasting."
Departments that are not eligible to
receive awards sometimes have
trouble getting recognition. A
scientist at Harvard working in a field
not covered by the awards commented
that " those branches of science that
are not eligible have a hard time to
prove that they are, perhaps, just as
good or even nearly as good as the
departments that have laureates."
Sentiments that I am sure will be
shared by many people at Imperial,
especially the mathematicians.
The preeminence of the Nobel prize
is an interesting phenomenon. Many
other scientific prizes boast much
longer histories. The Copley and
Rumford Medals of the Royal Society
were established in 1731 and 1800
respectively. The Nobel Prize, with
an eighty-six year history, is a
comparative newcomer.Nor is the
prize money offered for the prize as
significant as some. The John and
Alice Tyler Ecology Award headed
the prize money stakes in 1976, while
at that time the Nobel Prize money
had reached its peak of $160,000,
often shared between several
recipients. Over the years the award
has still been sizeable enough to
attract considerable attention. It is
possibly the truly international flavour
of the prize that has maintained its
supremacy.. Where the prize is
unquestionably in a class of its own
is in the selection process which
ensures that the names on the prize
certificates are eventually those which
feature most prominently in our

present day text books. The prizes for
literature and peace are far more
subjective, and have frequently been
criticised for political and ideological
reasons.
The prestige of the prize, and the
publicity which it attracts, have lent
legitimacy to many ventures. On both
sides of the Iron Curtain Nobel
laureates have spoken out on political
matters. In response to Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov's
vehement condemnation of Soviet
political repression, all five of the
Soviet Union's Nobel Laureates, with
thirty five other academics,wrote a
letter to Pravda denouncing Sakharov
as "an instrument of hostile
propoganda against the Soviet
Union." Such actions might explain
why the Nobel Foundation is less than
eager to bestow on Soviet scientists
an honour given in the spirit of
philanthropy.
Laureates in the United States have
also spoken out on political matters.
In 1970 fourty-four laureates wrote to
the president asking him to bring the
war in Vietnam to a rapid conclusion.
There was some highly favourable
public comment on this move, to the
effect that it was about time that the
scientific community took a stand
instead of keeping a decidedly low
profile. However, there was some
highly unfavourable comment from
other laureates, who considered this
an entirely irresponsible political act.
Quite clearly, scientists and others
have come to the opinion that the
views of laureates on issues outside
their sphere of work carry weight not

only in science but in public affairs.
This may emanate from the mistaken
belief that anyone who can fathom out
the most intricate secrets of the
universe is amply qualified to make
significant statements on the workings
of something as simple as the running
of the world.
Nobel Prize laureates have become,
not surprisingly, a self-perpetuating
breed. The laureate "family tree"
which was started by Rayleigh for his
discovery of argon, is quite
impressive. Rayleigh worked with
another laureate, JJ Thomson, who in
turn spawned a whole host of
laureates, including Rutherford, our
very own GP Thomson (JJ's son) and
Born to name but a few. From
Rutherford sprang up no less than
eleven other laureates. Among these
was another "son of Imperial" PMS
Blackett, as well as Chadwick, Bohr
and Appleton.
The father-son laureate relationship
is not uncommon. Sir William Henry
Bragg and Sir William L Bragg were
the only father and son team ever to
have shared the prize (for their joint
work on the diffraction of electrons
through crystals). Niels Bohr won the
prize for physics in 1922. Fifty three
years later, his son Aage Bohr jointly
won the physics prize for his work on
non-spherical atomic nuclei. Master-
student laureate relationships are
endless, as previously outlined, but
the relationship between Nobel
laureates and their apprentices is often
stormy, and academic conflict is not
unknown. One of the more infamous
cases was that of an eventual laureate,
Herman Muller, and his laureate
master TH Morgan. Muller observed
on Morgan, "the great bulk of the
facts of real significance subsequent
to 1911, and practically all after 1913,
were found by younger workers,
quite independently of guidance from
him in experiments which they had
planned on the basis of their own
more advanced viewpoints. Their
results and interpretations were,
however, later accepted by Morgan."
This type of situation has since
acquired the tag of Morganism.
In the academically competetive
world of the laureates such instances
are not uncommon, with young up-
and-coming minds eager to assert
themselves in their own right, and
masters sometimes slow to
acknowledge their contributions. The
path to prizedom is not easy, as
Professor Wilkinson illustrates very
well. After working in nuclear
chemistry at Berkley, he moved to
MIT and inorganic chemistry. He was
made an assistant professor at
Harvard in 1951 where he published
his first results showing the novel
"sandwich" structure of the
compound ferrocene a year later.
However, in 1956 Harvard decided,
as Prof Wilkinson puts it himself, that
Harvard "could do without me," and
he was "let go". Our own laureate
returned to Blighty and received the
prize for chemistry in 1973, for that
very work on sandwich compounds.
