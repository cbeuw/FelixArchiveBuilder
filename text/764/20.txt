The St. Valentines Day Massacre
returned to the City and Guilds Union
Office last Friday. This time it was
a slaughter of the innocents. Duncan
Royle, Guilds President, knew that
Anne Driver, "Vice" President, was
in for a surprise in the form of a
tarzanogram, while Anne knew that
Duncan was to be greeted by a
shapely stripogram. Neither of them
knew the other's secret. The whole
affair was conducted under cover of
the reopening of the Guilds office by
the Dean of City and Guilds. The
Dean duly cut the ribbon to the office
and chatted with Duncan, during
which time the astonishingly heavy
press coverage, at least four
photographers and a video team, did
not seem to be dispersing. At last,
Tarzan arrived, complete with loin
cloth, and proceeded to hurl the
Guilds VP over his shoulder and carry
her off, to cheers from the audience.
Then came Duncan's turn. He was
given ten of the best by a saucy
schoolgirl brandishing a ruler. Then,
after being forced to "unwrap" his
present, he decided to inspect it more
closely. Not satisfied with the lady's
state of atire, he rounded the whole
event off by removing what was left
of her clothing, with his teeth!
When "pressed" on the matter,
Duncan confessed that he was not in
control of his faculties and had been
completely dominated. " I kept my
eyes closed most of the time."
(Lots of) rooms to let
The Easter Lettings Scheme in Beit
and Garden Halls and Houses in
Evelyn Gardens has been attracting a
lower number of bookings than
predicted. To date only seven outside
bookings have been taken for the
scheme. Commenting on this,
Michael Arthur said that the
advantage of the Easter Lettings
Scheme was that it only incured costs
in proportion to the number of rooms
booked, as students would only be
moved as necessary and cleaning
costs involved only when rooms
needed to be cleaned.
The scheme has run into additional
problems with only half the booking
forms required having been printed.
The existing forms, which were to
have been produced by the Sherfield
Print Unit, were eventually printed by
the Union Print Unit. While a similar
scheme has been successfully run
over the summer for several years,
this is the first time that this has been
tried over Easter. The schemes in
Southside and Linstead Halls are still
being run by the Conference Centre.
Rag haul
The Royal College of Science Union
raised £390.57 last Saturday in a
collection of behalf of the Church of
England's Childrens Society. The
collection, based on the theme of
James Bond & Mata Haris, was
carried out by only seven members in
the Ealing Broadway shopping centre
raising a record £134.57. The
manager of the centre commented that
it was "so good to see students doing
something for the community." This
collection has seen two RCSU
students bringing their yearly rag
totals to over £250 each.
The RCS will be collecting again
tomorrow as part of IC Rag's
Monopoly Game with several other
British universities taking part. The
event is expected to raise in the region
of £10,000.
All new JCR
IC Union will be pressing for control
of the JCR bar, it was confirmed at
Tuesday's U G M . The meeting
approved Union president Christine
Taig's recommendations that the
Union support long term plans for a
new JCR in the same Building as the
new sports hall. In the interim ICU
will be looking to gain some
finanmcial compensation for the loss
of conference income in the JCR, as
well as control of the bar. The JCR
issue has had a much lower profile
since the sucessful boycott of the QT
burger bar three weeks ago. It is
unlikely that significant progress will
be made until the results of the
Academic Staff Assembly survey are
known; the staff are being questioned
on the reorganisation of the Sherfield
SCR, which is tied in with the
refurbishment of the JCR. College
Deputy Secretary Brian LLoyd
Davies told FELIX yesterday that the
new JCR was in the earlist planning
stages, and that the chief concern for
the College was still how to
accommodate the increasing numbers
using the refectories.
Conman haul
The 'Linstead Conman', who stole
£500 from a student earlier this term,
has been operating in the College area'
for at least 18 months. Chief Security
Officer Geoffrey Reeves told FELIX
yesterday that there have been 7 or
8 incidents where the man has
approached students asking for large
sums of money. In several cases,
students have handed over sizeable
sums. The man's story has been much
the same in each,case; he offers 'gold'
watches and jewellery as security for
cash.
The conman restricts his
approaches to Chinese or
Mediterranean students. College
security commented that the Gerard
Road police station were taking an
interest in the case, checking through
their files in an attempt to identify the
conman, and that they would be very
grateful for further information.
When the conman was first reported
to Security, they contacted Air
France, using the name and Paris
address given by the conman, but
both the name and address turned out
to be false.
The wardens of Linstead and Beit
halls told FELIX that none of their
residents have been approached
recently, but they reiterated Security's
appeal for any information, which
should be passed on to College
Security or the police station in
Gerard road
On the air
After problems caused by flood
damage last week, the IC Radio
medium wave transmitter is back on
the air again. Technical manager
Dave Stanley said that reception had
been improving all week and that he
expected further improvements
during Saturday. The transmitter
housing is being insulated to prevent
a future reccurrence of the problem.
Isn't science wonderful?
Many thanks to Sinclair Stammers
of the Biology Department for his
