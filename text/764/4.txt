suggests would be far more likely to
increase the violence inflicted by
terrorists in Northern Ireland, and its
target would undoubtedly be British
soldiers and civilians.
Terrorism must indeed be stamped
out but this cannot be done by
resorting to the very methods we wish
to destroy. It is the philosophies of
people such as Mr Allen which ensure
the continuing viability of terrorism
as a weapon for unscrupulous leaders.
Yours sincerely,

Dear FELIX,
On Thursday February 19th
Amnesty International began a
concerted campaign to focus attention
on the use of the death penalty in the
United States of America.
In thirty-seven of those states you
can be hanged, electrocuted, gassed,
poisoned or shot for murder. There
is abundant evidence that the death
sentence is applied unjustly. Some
states permit the execution of children
and mentally retarded offenders. Poor
people and blacks are far more likely
to receive the death penalty for an
equivalent offence than are middle-
class whites. At least 23 prisoners
have been put to death this century for
crimes which, it is now known, they
did not commit.
At present there are 1788 people on
death row in the USA—a record
number. And the rate of executions
is accelerating. The need for pressure
on the American authorities has never
been more urgent.
Amnesty International is uncon-
ditionally opposed to the death
penalty, believing it to be "a cruel,
inhuman and degrading punish-
ment." In Amnesty's view: "it is not
only contradictory, but a threat to
humane values, for any society to
proclaim that the taking of life is the
most intolerable of crimes and, at the
same time to countenance any form
of execution carried out as an act of
retribution in the name of society
itself."
The Amnesty International group at
Imperial has decided to embrace this
campaign fully and is planning a
series of events designed to raise the
relevant issues at the centre of the
death penalty debate. It also hopes to
get students involved in letter writing
to the various state authorities in the
USA.
No doubt there are many people at
Imperial on both sides of this
contentious issue. No doubt many
people believe that the execution of
murderers or rapists is entirely
justified and that Amnesty is just
being soft. In the next few months IC
Amnesty Group hopes that as many
students as possible will get involved
in this campaign and demonstrate that
the abolition of the inhuman rite of
execution is a priority for our modern
societies.
Anyone who is interested in
abolishing the death penalty in the
USA should come to IC Amnesty
Group meetings on Tuesdays at
5.30pm in the Brown Committee
Room, top floor of the Union
Building. Alternatively contact: S
Bosher (Physics II), O Smart (Physics

Puerile
Humour
Dear Dave,
The publication of last week's
Broadsheet has forced me to write to
FELIX to express my disquiet at an
item which appeared towards the end
of the edition. The item was a spoof
advice piece dealing with the subject
of AIDS.
This was the sort of puerile
prepubescent humour I would not
normally associate with Broadsheet.
The article made light of the
mythology surrounding the virus, and
in doing so compounded these myths.
If the author considers that a subject
which is currently causing so much
public concern, and occupying so
much of the government's time, is a
fit topic for such immature drivel,
then he is of a considerably lower in-
tellect than I already consider him to
be.
I have heard comment to the effect
that people will realise the vein in
which such a piece is written, and are
perfectly able to be discriminating in
their appreciation of it. If this were
the case, then we would not current-
ly be experiencing such a massive
problem in educating the public as to
the dangers of AIDS.
I would hope that the Broadsheet
editor will take greater care in accep-
ting such articles for publication in the
future, or can we expect a feature on
leprosy next week, followed by one
on coronary heart disease, all with a
similar total lack of sensitivity and
perception?

The Great JCR Dream
ICU Council and Tuesday's UGM
accepted Christine's recommendation
that the Union presses for full control
of the JCR bar and financial
compensation for the loss of
conference income. In the long term,
the Union is approving the scheme to
"look at the feasibility" of a new
JCR—in the same building as the
Sports Hall. Though the Exec are
confident that College are now far
more receptive to their ideas, it would
be idiotic to put much faith in the
plans for an "all new" JCR. This
vague proposal must not be seen as
a trade-off for accommodating
administration when negotiating the
immediate future of the JCR and
Sherfield catering. The original plan
to swap the JCR and the MDH was
supposed to be a firm agreement.
College's chief concern is still
meeting the space requirements of an
increasing number of refectory users.
At the moment a new JCR is about
as likely as a straight answer from the
College Assistant Secretary.
Camborne
A vote to ban Camborne fixtures
entirely would have been premature.
Their behaviour is probably no
different from any rowdy sports team
on tour. Nevertheless, this is no
reason to stand by and accept any act
of theft or vandalism, even if, as
Security Chief Geoffrey Reeves puts
it, we "got off lightly this year." The
traditions of the fixture are irrelevant;
its prestige is wearing a bit thin.
Election Publicity
A correction to last week's editorial
and my publicity notice; artwork
submitted on Monday February 23rd
at 9.30am will be ready for papers
down—5.30pm Wednesday not
Thursday. A l l other dates and
deadlines are as given. If you are
standing for a sabbatical post and have
not yet seen me about publicity,
please do so as soon as possible.
