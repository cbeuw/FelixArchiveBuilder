naughty ministry of defence types
have been concealing it from Joe
Bloggs MP.
The main thrust of the accusations
was really quite simple; after the
Chevaline debacle of the seventies (a
massively expensive and not
particularly successful update of
Polaris), the Ministry of Defence
promised to inform the Commons
Public Accounts Committee of any
"' ' of °ne
claiming that the reason for the
programme's ban was not even the
political secret of the concealed £500
million, but some confused expose of
the non-independence of Polaris. So
what's all this cheap thriller knock-
on-the-door-in-the-middle-of-the-
night stuff about?
One is occasionally driven to
wonder whether it's not an elaborate
ploy to advance Mr Campbell's

content of their programmes in the
run up to an election. It is worth
remembering that any review of
secrecy legislation in the light of the
Zircon affair could lead to more,
rather than less, restrictive conditions.
The search for motives can be
endless, in fact so good a subject for
the imagination is it that you can bet
there will be any number of books
cashing in on it. What's more you can
which the announcement that they
were in breach of the official secrets
act was met with a loud cheer, the
meeting went straight into a showing
of a quite clear tape of the offending
item.
The audience saw Mr Duncan
Campbell leaping from dish-covered
ground station to dish-covered ground
station presenting a sort of 'Boys
Own' Guide to signals intelligence
satellites. Interspersed with Mr
Campbell's concerned boy scout
visage was lots of stock footage of
rockets taking off and people
assembling civilian satellites. Later
we were treated to several interviews
with assorted civil servants and ex-
science advisors.
The best of these was an interview
with a former Chief Scientific
Advisor to the MoD who happily
chatted for several minutes about the
theory of spy satellites and their
obvious detectability. However, his
face dropped and he sat frozen for a
good ten seconds when asked about
the Zircon project. When he finally
came round from this icicles-in-the-
underwear like trance, he only
managed to burble something about
not having heard of this project.
It emerged fairly clearly that once
you launch a spy satellite anyone
whose technology has advanced to the
level of the telescope can deduce what
it is. A number of references were
made to the relationship between US
and British intelligence services but
no insinuation was really made to
anything you couldn't have read in the
press during the GCHQ dispute. Then
in the last five minutes Mr Campbell's
monologue launched into the cost of
the whole enterprise and how our
project costing more than £250m—
yet here was this unheard of Zircon
project costing twice that.
The attempts at covering up the
existence of the Zircon project were
shown to be amateur in the extreme.
It was alleged that the Zircon satellite
would be sent up under the cover of
being a Skynet (military
communications) satellite. When the
planned launching of the first two
Sky nets were announced, so were the
names of Britain's first two planned
astronauts (one from the RAF, one
from the RN), one to accompany each
satellite on a space shuttle launch.
Yet, when the 3rd "Skynet" was
announced, there was no mention of
any Army astronaut to accompany it.
The first two Skynets were being put
over the Atlantic, but according to a
British Aerospace press release of the
time, the third "Skynet" was going
up at 52° East (ie over Russia), to
facilitate communication with the
"large British military presence in
Hong Kong." When quizzed about
this, the MoD replied that the
satellite's destination was a secret,
and the BA press release was quickly
rehashed to eliminate any mention of
its intended location. It was admitted
that each Skynet needs its own radar
dish on the ground. Cut to newly built
Skynet ground base in Hampshire, all
construction complete. Count 'em
carefully; yep, there's only two radar
dishes ie only two Skynet satellites.
The imme'J
' :
mpression left as
our Duncan's stirring right-to-know
speech faded away, amid numerous
subtle references to the title of the
series, was a doubt that any of the
contents could be a strategic secret.
We were then treated to Tony Benn
journalistic career. More plausibly it
has been suggested that the use of the
official secrets act is an attempt to
worry the media about the political
be pretty sure that the Beeb won't
have to worry about the viewing
figures for the rest of the "Secret
Society" series.
