of the 1980's Mtfttt
are shown in diagrams 1 and 2. It is
worrying to note that the number of
heterosexuals affected has reached
2.8% of the total. The increase in this
percentage is currently very slow, and
at this level it could be possible to
contain the risk of significant spread
in this group. However, this will only
be achieved if every effort is made to
keep the level of public knowledge of
the disease at a maximum. To further
the truths, and destroy some of the
myths of AIDS.
AIDS is transmitted via blood,
either through transfusions or on IV
needles or surgical equipment. It is
also transmitted by sexual contact,
that is by contact between the sexual
secretions—semen or vaginal fluid—
and the membranes of the vagina,
mouth or anus.
Does anyone have any questions?

The boxed figure represents the
proportion of non—homosexual
sufferers from AIDS.
The fantasies and the facts
Q: Who is most at risk?
A: Anyone who is promiscuous,
especially homosexual men. Anyone
receiving blood transfusions in parts
of the world where the donated blood
is not screened for the AIDS virus.
Anyone receiving injections with an
infected needle, and especially drug
misusers who share injection
equipment.
Q: Can you catch AIDS from oral
sex?
A: It is quite possible. The greatest
danger is to those who actually
swallow semen or vaginal fluid, but
the presence of these secretions in the
mouth can be hazardous, especially
if you have sores or ulcers in the
mouth. Even in the absence of these,
transmission could happen via mem-
brane penetration. The best bet is to
avoid oral sex unless you are sure.
Q: If you have sex, how can you
stay safe from AIDS?
: The fewer people you have sex with,
the safer you are. Remember that
prostitutes may have taken to the
street to finance a drug addiction,
which makes them doubly dangerous.
Avoid them. Cut out casual
relationships and one-night stands.
Know your partner! If you must have
sex with someone other than your
usual partner, use a condom to reduce
the risk of infection—it does work.
Remember, if you catch AIDS you
can pass it on to your usual partner.
Q: Are you less likely to catch AIDS
if your partner is more gentle with
you?
A: No. This idea arose through the
theory that mucosa which had been
damaged through excess force would
be more permeable, but there are
cases on record of women catching
AIDS through artificial insemination,
which was no Houbt a very gentle
process.
Q: Can you catch AIDS from non-
sexual body contact?
A: No. It is quite alright to shake
hands, share cups, utensils, etc.
Q: If you need blood, or dental or
medical treatment involving
injections, can you catch the AIDS
virus?
A: In this country it is almost
impossible, but in some parts of the
world blood is not checked for
infection, and medical or surgical
equipment may not be adequately
sterilised. Try to avoid treatment
involving injections and surgical
procedures, and receiving blood from
local donors, under these
circumstances.
Q: Can you catch AIDS from
kissing or heavy petting?
A: No. Although the virus has been
isolated in saliva and tears, it is only
present in very low concentrations,
and does not appear to be infectious
from this source. You can kiss and pet
as intensely as you like, provided that
blood or sexual secretions do not enter
you partner's body. Accidental
spillages of blood or sexual secretions
can safely be washed off normal skin,
as soap and water effectively kills or
removes the virus.
Q: Can you catch Aids from a
toothbrush or razor?
A: Possibly, as these may become
bloodstained, and cause small
scratches of the face or mouth. You
might also easily catch other things,
including herpes, so it is best to avoid
sharing anyway.
Q: Can you catch AIDS from a
toilet seat or a towel?
A: No.
Q: How easy is it to be tested for
HIV infection?
A: You can apply in total confidence
to any special clinic, either STD -
Sexually Transmitted Diseases, or
GUM—Genitourinary Medicine.
You will almost certainly be offered
counselling, information and advice
before the test is carried out, and
again if necessary in a few days when
the result is available.
The warning
It is likely that you, the reader, fall
into a low-risk group. You are
probably heterosexual, and you
probably don't inject drugs. But just
suppose that you caught AIDS - it
isn't impossible. Then suppose that
you passed it onto someone who was
promiscuous. Within a month, they
might infect five people...who might
infect twenty...who might infect a
hundred...and then five hundred...
and then two thousand...
In other words, the next time you cry
out with passion, you could be sowing
the seeds for two thousand cries of
misery.
AIDS is a threat to us all, whatever
we are. We all have a responsibility
to ourselves and to our fellow
members of society, to behave
sensibly and to heed the warnings
given to us.
When writing this article, I tried my
best to think of some final, convincing
paragraph, some way of expressing
my concern and the concern of the
people I have spoken to while
gathering information. Although, as
shown earlier, there are only about
seven hundred developed cases of
AIDS in this country at the moment,
remember that there may be many
more people carrying the virus.
Nobody was prepared to tell me
exactly how many; perhaps nobody
really knows. My main source, who
has asked to remain anonymous,
looked at me hopelessly, and said:
"Everyone seems to expect us to
stop this thing by magic. We do have
a way of stopping it, without ever
producing any drugs, All we have to
do is stop passing it on. Somehow I
don't expect this to happen."
I asked why.
"We have all known since 1961
that smoking causes heart disease,
cancer, bronchitis, you name it.
Warnings are printed on every packet
of cigarettes. How many people have
given up smoking? About ten per
cent. Which do you think is the
greater human urge, to smoke or to
make love? Please tell them to be
careful."
'Them' means us. All of us.
