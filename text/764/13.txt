Violence
Don't we all long for a bit of
romance—mystique, love, jealousy,
noble courage and adventure? Maybe
this is why the legend of King Arthur
has exercised a spell over the
collective imaginations of western
Europe for over one millenia.
Unfortunately debunked by tightly-
trousered Michael Wood in his In
Search of... King Arthur programme,
the legend seems to have begun with
a petty chieftan who made war, not
on the Saxons but on fellow Celts.
Celts fleeing to Brittany exported the
story of the noble king who would
rise again from sleep to free them, and
the French began to write poems
about it all. Geoffrey of Monmouth,
a so-called historian, freely
improvising where solid facts ran out,
put Arthur and his knights into a
up by foster parents, is hailed as King
of all the Britains after drawing an
enchanted sword out of an anvil—then
gets another sword thrown to him by
the Lady of the Lake. Being a wise,
good and godly man, he drives out the
Saxons and sets up the fellowship of
the Knights of the Round Table to
protect his kingdom, rescue damsels
and avenge wrongs; dragon killings
mi)
Quietly they rode near to look
the treachery of Mordred (Arthur's
power-crazed nephew) and Quinevere
and Launcelot's affair. Arthur, badly
wounded, is taken away by four
queens in a boat, legend saying that
he will rise from sleep one day to free
Britain from foes. Whether he will
drive out the Vikings first (most of
East Scotland, Durham, Yorkshire
and East Anglia) or the Saxons (the
rest of England) remains to be seen.
The major problem with these
knights is the sexism and classism—
women largly get bit parts of damsels
in distress, apart from Quinevere,
Nimue, a female magician, and the
Lady Linnet, whose voice was
nagging rather than bird-like. Very
few people other than knights and
their squires (squires were youth-
opportunity-scheme knights) ngure in
the stories at all. The magic is still
there however, even in the T. H.

The Once and Future King, comp-
rising The Sword in the Stone and
other books, and in Mark Twain's
Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,
a satire on 19th century romanticism.
Roger Lancelyn Green has also
written a good version, again for
children, published by Puffin and
imaginatively entitled King Arthur
history book and from then on it was
no holds barred.
The best publicity agent of all was
Sir Thomas Malory, who re-wrote the
Arthurian legend whilst stuck in
Newgate prison for being on the
losing side in the War of the Roses.
He added a request for deliverence to
his epic, which was printed by
Caxton, but nevertheless died in his
eleventh year in Newgate.
It is easy for us with our complex
20th century fiction and drama, full
of underlying metaphors and rather
boring hidden meanings, to patronise
medieval literature as simple.
However with Arthur even the themes
are complex, the language is beautiful
and lyrical and the characters have
real emotions and desires. Taken at
face value, Arthur has all the material
for a good story; blood (lots of battles
and jousts), sex (various damsels in
samite dresses, plus the adultery
between Quinevere and Launcelot)
and religion (the quest for the Holy
Grail).
The basic plot, with variations on
the theme, tells how Arthur, brought
and all loved him at once
by appointment and giants a
speciality. At the height of the glory
of the Holy Isle of Logres (as it was
called) the knights set out to find the
Grail, the cup used by Christ at the
last supper. Many of the knights never
returned from this quest and soon
after the Kingdom of Logres is broken
for ever by the combined effects of
and his Knights of the Round Table,
price £2.50. If you're looking for a
grown-up tome The High History of
the Holy Grail, published by James
Clark & Co. at £6.95 is available, but
be warned, it contains much ancient
and ye olde spelling. Thereupon, I lay
down my pen and girt my lab coat on
me, bearing my readers farewell.
