Take
a piece of fire, a piece of water,
a piece of rabbit or a piece of
tree,
or any piece of human being,
mix it, shake it, stopper it up,
keep it warm, in the dark, in the
light refrigerated,
let it stand still for a while—
yourselves far from still—
but that's the real joke.
After a while
you look—and it's growing,
a little ocean, a little volcano,
a little tree, a little heart, a little
brain,
so little you don't hear it
lamenting
as it wants to get out,
but that's the real joke, not
hearing it.
Then go
and record it, all dashes or
all crosses, some with exclamation
marks,
all noughts and all figures, some
with exclamation-marks,
and that's the real joke, in effect a
test-tube
is a device for changing noughts
into exclamation marks.
That's the real joke
which makes you forget for a
while
that really you yourself are
In the test tube.
Miroslav Holub is Chief Research
Immunologist at the Institute for
Clinical and Experimental Medicine
in Prague. He is also one of
Czechoslovakia's leading poets. This
dual role (uncommon in English-
speaking culture, but less rare
elsewhere) allows him to look closely
at questions of subjectivity versus
objectivity. In an interview with
Poetry Review in 1985, he states his
aspiration "to bring the hard-centred
approach of science into poetic
thinking." Similarly, he suggests that
"one of the illnesses of modern
poetry is too much subjectivity." This
position is contentious (many people
seem to want a rigid barrier between
objective and subjective ideas), but
Holub clearly feels that he gains some
insight by combining scientific and
poetic thought.
Scientific objectivity is a temple
many people like to worship at.
Miroslav Holub is well qualified to
comment on this, and the above poem
suggests that he is quite aware of the
weaknesses within the foundations.
Likewise, much feminist thought has
been directed at supposed scientific
objectivity: much research is based on
implicit sexist assumptions, as perusal
of New Scientist or many other
journals w ;
" *»ow. Similarly,
science's record on .acism and other
issues is not without blemish.

As you may have read in a previous
article in FELIX, 21st March 1987
marks the beginning of the EEC
.designated European Year of the
Environment. In response to this large
scale international initiative several
groups in the College are holding an
Environment Week from March 2nd
to 6th.
The aim of the week is to promote
an awareness of the environment in
a college where so much of the
teaching and research has direct or
indirect implications for the
environment.
The events scheduled for the week
include:-
• Monday 2nd—Kenneth Carlisle
MP (Cons) and Chris Smith MP
(Lab) talking on the policies of
their respective parties in relation
to the environment. Mech. Eng.
LT220.
• Tuesday 3rd—Michael
Meadowcroft MP (Alliance) on the
above subject. Mech. Eng. LT220.
• Wednesday 4th—Jonathon
Porritt, Director, Friends of the
Earth. Elec. Eng. LT408.
Thoughout the week there will be
exhibitions and displays in various
locations around the College. These
will include exhibitions on renewable
energy from the Dept. of Energy the
CEGB and Friends of the Earth.
There will also be an information stall
in the JCR with books, posters etc.
for sale. Films and videos on various
aspects of the environment will also
be shown and there will be exhibits
of models of renewable energy
technology. Some emphasis will be
placed on the research, employment
and economic opportunities offered
by the more environmentally benign
technologies. If you are at all
interested in the environment then
please attend any or all of the above
events.
If you feel that you would like to
do something positive for the week
and would like to help out with the
organisation of the project then please
contact Theresa Lisher or Stuart
McFarlane via the MSc. pigeonholes
at the Centre for Environmental
Technology, 48 Prince's Gardens
(between Mech. Eng. and Southside)
or by leaving a message on 7214
internal, or by attending one of our
short meetings to be held at
12.50— 1.00pm on Monday 23rd,
Tuesday 24th and Friday 26th of
