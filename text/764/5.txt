International Week
a review
How many Imperial College students
are aware that this week is
International Week? Very few,
judging from the disappointingly low
attendance at the talks, film, and
symposiums organised by the
Overseas Student's Committee.
International Week began on
Monday with an opening speech by
the Rector on "The Significance of
the International Community at
Imperial College." He stated that he
himself was born in Germany, and
that one of the remarkable facts about
Imperial College and the University
of London as a whole was that it
comprises a "fairly international
community", 20% of all students at
IC being foreign. This led to
comments on the financial
implications of a relatively large
overseas student population. The
Rector said that the cuts in grants
allocated to universities have forced
them to accept more overseas
students; Imperial College is no
exception and fees from overseas
students represent 7 % of the College
income, but the level of foreign
students has not risen significantly
since the new legislation was passed.
The Rector deplored the fact that high
fees were a deterent to many foreign
students.
The cultural contribution made by
the international community was seen
by the Rector as "an enormous
enrichment of the experience of
studying at university" for British
students. He nevertheless deplored
the phenomenon of "people from
country X spending all their time with
people from country X , " clearly a
problem at IC.
On the subject of religion, the
Rector advocated firstly that scientists
become aware that "Newton's laws
and Schrodinger's wave equation"
are not all there is to knowledge, and
confessed "some religious feeling"
but no adherence to any particular
religion. Secondly he advocated
tolerance of other religious beliefs and
noted that minor differences between
similar religions are often a source of
conflict, as is the case in Northern
Ireland.
The third main topic was conflict,
the avoidance of which "is a principal
concern for mankind." The Rector
hoped that students from countries
engaged in war "spoke to each other''
and noted that feeling about research
for defence was a major sore point.
On this subject he referred to the
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI),
adding that he considered it a
"technological nonsense" and giving
reasons. He would nevertheless
consider accepting a SDI contract at
Imperial College if it were on
"normal commercial terms" and on
a subject that he wished to see
researched.
On Tuesday a symposium took
place in Chem Eng Lecture Theatre
1 involving representatives of the
Commonwealth Office and the Royal
Society. The topic was
"Sociocultural, scientific and
technological cooperation begins
here." Although less than twenty
people attended, a positive debating
atmosphere was created which
encouraged questions from the floor.
Important issues were raised, such
as the freeflow of scientists between
nations, the economic and cultural
cooperation which it involved, the
role of the UN agencies in the transfer
of technology, and problems arising
from delicate political situations. A
central question from the floor related
to the intellectual boycott of South
Africa, and whether freeflow of
scientists should be extended to such
countries as the USSR, Cuba or
Taiwan. The topic of human rights
and the intervention* of politics in
scientific research were also discussed
and international scientific
cooperation was seen as necessary in
the solution of problems posed by, for
example, pollution control and AIDS.
It was concluded that international
cooperation should involve both the
exchange of individuals and of
knowledge, and that this should be
done to the benefit of all nations.
