Clubs FELIX, Friday February 20th 1987 1 6
Picocon is the event of the year; it's
the convention of the Science Fiction
Society of Imperial College. As the
name suggests, it is a small
convention and it lasts for only twelve
hours but during this time there will
be speakers, videos, quizzes, games,
RPGs and slide shows.
This is the fifth Picocon held at
Imperial College. Over the past years
we have had many top quality
speakers including, for example,
David Langford and Brian Stableford.
This year our guests of honour are
author John Brunner and space artist
Dave Hardy. Both men are British
and are highly esteemed in their
separate fields of work (which are
generally dominated by Americans).
John Brunner has written several
books, mostly science fiction, and has
won several awards including the
prestigious Hugo award for Stand on
Zanzibar (1968) and the Nebula
award for The Sheep Look Up (1972).
He has written professionally for over
thirty years and has contributed much
to both the intellectual and lighter
sides of science fiction. His talk
should be very entertaining and
provoke much discussion.
Britain has produced a few talented
science fiction artists. One of the
latest and most noted artists is David
Hardy. Along with Patrick Moore, he
wrote Challenge of the Stars which
he illustrated using a vivid sense of
imagination and scientific accuracy.
As well as speaking about science
fiction art in general, Mr Hardy will
also be giving a colourful slideshow.
As well as our guests of honour, we
have invited many other authors,
science fiction and fantasy buffs who
should be popping in from the real
world (or unreal world as the case
may be). After mingling with the 'rich
and infamous' (no, I don't mean the
WellSoc and Consoc committee
members), you could join in with the
fantasy and wargames. Hopefully, we
should be running Car Wars or
Paranoia and other role playing
games.
Throughout the day, various video
films will be shown. These will
include Dark Star, The Hunger and
Scanners (especially for all you
bloodthirsty non-vegetarians). Last
year, the ICSF challenged the
Cambridge Science Fiction Society to
a trial of charades and hack questions,
we thrashed them in one game and
narrowly lost another. This year our
superconductivity-HAL-computer-
like team intend to demonstrate their
superiority with style, so come along
and give them your support.
Refreshments can be bought and
will include drinks, sandwiches and
pizzas.
You don't have to be a science
fiction or fantasy hack to attend
Picocon. The convention starts at
10.00am and finishes at 10.00pm on
Saturday February 21st, and is held
in the Biology seminar rooms (old
Bot-Zoo common rooms) in Beit
Arch. Entrance will be £2.50 non-
members, £2.00 members.

Film S o c i e t y
IC Film Society's next presentation,
this Thursday 26th in Physics LT1
(doors 7.30pm), is John Huston's
Prizzi's Honour, starring Jack
Nicholson (Easy Rider, One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Kathleen
Turner (Bodyheat, Romancing the
Stone, Crimes of Passion).
John Huston, one of Hollywood's
greatest directors, who made such
classics as The Maltese Falcon and
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,
manages to keep up his standards in
Prizzi's Honour. Huston keeps on
making films which are different and
unusually cast but very entertaining
such as Prizzi's Honour.
Jack Nicholson plays the enforcer
of a Brooklyn mafia family, who falls
head-over-heels in love with Kathleen
Turner, who he later finds out is a
freelance contract killer. Nicholson's
performance as the awestruck, slow
but not dumb, mafioso is both
believable and very funny. Time Out
recently called Kathleen Turner,
"Hollywood's hottest actress," and
it's no understatement, you'll know
why if you see Prizzi's Honour or any
of her recent films. However Prizzi's
Honour is not just a film with two big
stars giving electric performances, it
is also a very subtle and funny spoof
on the mafia and on mafia films. If
you miss this film you miss out.

Last Thursday, 15 members of Micro
Club squashed themselves into a
minibus and headed out towards
Croydon in search of Rediffusion
Flight Simulators. Despite mad
drivers and a turbocharged 2CV we
managed to reach our destination only
slightly worse for the trip. Many
thanks to Pete Hands for agreeing to
drive.
Inside we were given a humourous
talk on the history and principles of
simulations including two videos of
some of the incredible graphics which
are now possible. With heads still
buzzing of WIDE screens and sub-
pixel anti-aliasing we were taken on
a tour of the shop floor.
Don't forget the talk by Sir Clive
Sinclair on Thursday February 26th
at 1.00pm in Physics LT1. The title
is "Sinclair Computer." Since the
word is that he is about to release a
new computer this should be an
interesting talk
Micro Club meets every
Wednesday at 1.30pm in our club
room at the top of the West staircase.
Socialist
S o c i e t y
IC Socialist Society proudly present
"Tony Benn M P " on 23rd February
in the Great Hall at 1pm. This is a
Monday but I hope that as many of
you as possible can come. All are
welcome.
Tony Benn MP, the former Lord
Stansgate, is the former Labour
Energy Minister and is currently a
member of the Labour NEC. He has
been called the "darling of the left"
and is a brilliant speaker. He was the
MP for Bristol East until 1983 and has
now a 6264 majority in Chesterfield.
He holds the record for the most times
returned to Parliament. This will
hopefully be the best speaker meeting
at IC this year, so please come along!

Last Wednesday Real Ale Society
visited Young's brewery in
Wandsworth. We were shown how
the brewery has developed over the
years, the building was originally
built on a field where sheep had been
kept, hence the name "Ram
Brewery," and their woolly pet
' 'Ram Rod.'' Although the company,
which has a share trust scheme
allowing employees to benefit from
the company's profits, has kept pace
with new equipment, old machines
are preserved turning small corners
of the building into a museum. One
traditional practice still used is to
deliver the products to local hostelries
by horse and dray. This led to a visit
by the Queen to see the magnificent
horses, but although she had been
surrounded by bottles of "Ram Rod"
she was refreshed with a cup of tea.
Real Ale Society prefers to visit
sampling rooms, which makes the rest
of the evening interesting...
The regular meeting on Thursday
was also a success, the next one is
Thursday February 19th.
