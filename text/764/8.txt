Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday February 20th 1987 8
Christine's Piece
There I was, wondering what to write
about in this piece. Still pondering,
I headed towards the women's toilets
in the Union Building and found
inspiration on the wall, for someone
had written:
CT: "Why does nobody go to
UGM's?"
Student: ' 'Because they 're so
completeiy; totally and utterly, very,
very, boring!"
Apart from the fact that I thought
a toilet wall was a fairly strange place
to write a comment like this, it made
me think of three questions. Why do
we bother with UGM's once a month
if everyone (including me) dislikes
them? Whose fault is it that they're
boring? And what could I do about it?
question what Dave, Jackie and I have
been doing for our money. Maybe
nobody does have any burning issues
to put before the student population.
That's fine, but the opportunity still
has to be there just in case...that's
what comes of trying to be
democratic.
So who makes UGM's boring? Is
it the fault of the cumbersome rules,
with the inevitable procedural
wrangling? Is it those who make
reports, trying to give an account of
what they've been doing? Is it those
who ask questions they think are
important, or those who propose
motions? Or is it the poeple who don't
turn up and don't make things more
interesting and relevant by joining in?
Probably a combination of all these;
First, UGM's aren't something that
the sabbaticals organise for their own
gratification; none of us particularly
look forward to them. They're
supposed to be the opportunity for
anyone in the Union to question or
criticise their officers on the work
they've been doing in an open forum;
they're also the chance for all students
to contribute to policy or discuss
anything they see as important with
other students.
Maybe nobody does want to
but believe me, we do try to keep
reports brief and move onto the
potentially interesting motions as
quickly as possible. Unfortunately
just when we reach a point where
there might be some lively debate,
someone generally calls
"quorum"—and the whole thing
packs up. So you see, unless plenty
of people do go along to UGM's,
they'll never get more interesting.
So what to do about boring
UGM's? Short of resorting to sneaky
tactics—ie 'concocting' controversial
issues which are guaranteed to bring
people along in high temper, or
outright bribery/coersion, I'm not at
all sure. Guest speakers? Fancy
dress? You name it? Any (serious)
suggestions would be more than
welcome.
Of course we don't have to have
UGM's once a month. Some people
think one a term would be sufficient.
Personally I think only reporting back
three times a year would be getting
away with murder as far as sabbaticals
are concerned—but if UGM's don't
improve that'll almost certainly
happen. Does anybody care?
One last gripe on this subject. If
you really think UGM's are boring,
you should try some of the two dozen
College committees I sit on on your
behalf...but then of course that's what
I'm here for...(Only a fool would do
this job, Part 7).
At Council last Monday some very
serious problems came to light
concerning the 100 students at
Silwood. It's a great shame that these
students are so isolated and so often
forgotten. They have no immediate
access to services we take for granted
like welfare and accommodation
advice; they don't even have a
meeting room of their own. When
there is a problem at Silwood the
repercussions are felt heavily because
the student community is small and
close knit; and because of the lack of
resources to turn to. I only hope we
can improve the spread of information
about Silwood over the next few
weeks—and support the Silwood
students in some way when they ask
us to do so.
Last Chance
I'll be drawing names out of the hat
on February 24th to pick the lucky 2
recipients of a week in Sweden (see
last week's FELIX). Any maths,
physics or computing students still
interested, give me your name VERY
SOON.
Finally
I'm sorry that these 'bits' of mine
always seem to end up being boring.
I usually have wild and wacky ideas
about what to write sometime over the
weekend; but when it gets round to
Wednesday morning and it has to be
written NOW, it just doesn't seem to
come out like that, Personally I blame
it on the education system. Still, it's
probably better than thermodynamics.
Love you all (specially everyone I
forget to send Valentines to),
Christine.

GUTTERPRESS
To misquote Oscar Wilde, to invite
Camborne School of Mines to one
event at IC may be accounted a
misfortune, to invite them to two
smacks of carelessness. It had been
the day of the Bottle Match on
Saturday where hordes of pissed
miners from Cornwall and London
descended on Southside and the
Union Bar for "a few drinks".
Being curious about the function of
fire hoses, the Camborne crew
decided to watch its effect on the |
Pizza Bar. At this point Rob Northey
decided to shut the bar and kick them
all out, whereupon they all wandered
over to the Union Bar. Which is
where Man Tai comes into the story:
not content with having students from
all over Europe in his party courtesy
of Hyde Park Relay, our spud-like
friend decides to tell the Camborne
boys all about it, despite protestations
from Dave "Gutman" Colley.
Unable to resist a party, especially
where it involves a bar extension,
they merrily trot down to the Main
Dining Hall to try and remove the
mirrorball and various other bits of
the room in the way they do.
Once the Union Bar had been
cleared of the visitng psychos, the
assembled bar staff and helpers set
about clearing up all the blood and
other assorted nasties. At this point
a horde of cockroaches decided to
make their presence known in the
Union Bar. Rob "killer" Perry was
singularly unimpressed with all this,
and proceeded to set about the
assembled insects with a carving
knife, screaming "I'll get you! I'll get
you!" A few minutes later he stuck
his head outside the door and asked
if they grew new heads if you cut
them in half. Deciding that they might
do, he then went on to use a metal
ashtray instead.
Council at Silwood Park on
Monday seemed to be suffering from
an overdose of Wackosterone, as Pete
Wilson continued to berate Chairman
Hugh Southey on his rulings, to the
extent that when Hugh called for
order, Pete decided to challenge him
on calling order.
Gutterpress would not be complete
without the traditional Joe 90 story.
Being a cost-conscious student, Joe
finds that the best solution to repairing
his Hillman Imp, is not to go to the
garage where all he will get is "Ooh,
you just can't get the parts these
days—it's the gimbals you know. I'll
do it for a pony.'' The Joe 90 solution
is to find another car of the same
make, open the bonnet and take the
relevant part out. Quote of the week:
"This is the last day we are selling
orchids. You get three and they come
in a nice plastic sheath. Sheaths seem
to be the in thing these days."
