AIDS: The nightmare
In recent weeks, one subject which
appeared to have faded from
prominence has been brought to light
again by a campaign of posters,
leaflets and TV and radio
commercials released by the
government, and by a renewed burst
of speculation on the part of the
national press. That subject is AIDS.
AIDS has been variously described
as "The killer disease', 'The Gay
plague', or 'the body's reaction to
something unnatural'.
Are these fair descriptions ?.
We have heard that you can catch
it by shaking hands, and that because
of it, 80% of homosexuals should be
gassed. Is this really sensible?
This week, FELIX sets out to
examine the disease, and to clarify the
facts.
The history
AIDS in itself causes only a mild
condition of lymph gland
enlargement, but it destroys the
body's ability to protect itself by
attacking the human immune system.
Sufferers from AIDS are vulnerable
to any infection that is going.
Although we know little about the
origins of the disease, we can say
quite a lot about what it has been
doing in the last seven years.
In June 1981, five young men in
San Fransisco were reported to be
suffering from a rare condition called
Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia. All
the men admitted to being
promiscuous homosexuals, and this
confinement to one sexual group,
combined with the rarity of the
condition, caused some alarm among
the American medical community. By
July, a total of 26 cases had been
recognised, all of them in homosexual
men, and some of them dating back
to 1978. Many of the men exhibited
an even rarer condition called
Kaposi's Sarcoma, which causes
unsightly swellings on the skin. This
is now one of the most publicly
recognised symptoms of the disease
we have come to know as 'Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome', or
AIDS.
The combination of two such rare
problems confined to such a narrow
group represented a serious cause for
concern. The most plausible
explanation seemed to be a total lack
of cell-mediated immunity, and a
search was begun for verification and
a medical cause.
It was popular during that period
for certain groups of homosexuals to
use drugs to heighten the sexual
experience, and it was thought
possible that this practise could
provide a chemical cause for the
condition, although some
practitioners favoured the idea of an
accumulation of sexually transmitted
diseases. This led to the questioning
of the sufferers about their recent
sexual contacts, during which an
astounding fact came to light: A few
of them claimed to have had as many
as two thousand sexual contacts
during their lives, with many listing
hundreds. This extraordinary degree
of promiscuity meant that if the
disease was sexually transmitted, they
had been very highly exposed to it.
It also made the task of checking on
their contacts very protracted.
In 1982, as the number of cases
began to increase, reports were being
collected regularly by the United
States Centre for Disease Control,
who noticed that some Haitian men
who were not homosexual were
developing the condition. At the same
time, the first reports of cases
occurred in haemophiliacs and
women, thus proving beyond doubt
that the disease was not confined to
homosexual men. All the women who
developed AIDS had been in sexual
contact, or had shared intravenous
injection equipment with infected
men, and this, in conjunction with the
haemophiliac cases, implied that
infection took place by blood
transferrence or sexual contact, in a
similar manner to the spread of
Hepatitis B.
It was also early in 1982 that the
first case of AIDS was recognised in
the UK, and by the end of the year
the number had risen to three, all of
whom could be shown to have had
contacts in the United States. This
provided compelling evidence that
AIDS was an infectious disease, and
one with a long incubation period,
which had spread first and fastest
among very promiscuous homosexual
men, but which could be caught by
anyone. This is demonstrated by the
situation in some African states,
where the disease is distributed evenly
between men and women of all sexual
orientations. It is thought that the
rapid spread in these countries may
be due to the high incidence of
prostitution.
A concentrated search took place
for the cause of the disease, and in
1983 it was traced to a virus which
was very similar to a leukaemia-
causing virus discovered in 1981.
Because of this similarity it was
named Human T-Cell Leukaemia
Virus 3, or HTLV3. This virus was
cultured in the laboratory and used to
develop an antibody test which could
be applied both to patients blood
samples, and to donated blood. This
gave effective protection to
haemophiliacs, since from October
1985 they, and all other NHS patients
received only screened blood. Before
this date, blood had been heat-treated
to kill viral infections. As a result,
patients in the UK now have little or
nothing to fear from blood
transfusions.
That is how the situation stands at
the time of writing. The medical
services have been unable to develop
either an effective vaccine, or a cure.
However, several laboratories are
cultivating the virus, now named
Human Immunodeficiency Virus or
HIV. This allows extracts of HIV to
be tested for potential use as a
vaccine, and also provides viruses for
use in antiviral drug trials.
Earlier this month, the government
released the latest figures for the
number of people in this country who
have developed AIDS. These figures
689
