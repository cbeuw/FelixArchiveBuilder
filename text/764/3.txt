Dan in the drink
ICU Ents officer Dan Phillips was
strongly criticised at the meeting of
ICU Council on Monday. Mr
Phillips' persistent failure to attend
Council was attacked by several
members. The accounts of the Ents
Committee had not been made
available for inspection, causing
speculation that a large amount of
money had been wasted, particularly
on the Christmas carnival.
ICU President Christine Taig
defended Ents' performance and
pointed out that if they had been
making huge losses she would not
have authorised the spending of any
more money on entertainments. She
warned that Mr Phillips may resign
if he were threatened, leaving the
Union with no Ents Officer.
However, Council voted that if he
does not attend the next Council
meeting, which is on March 16th, he
should be asked to resign anyway.
In reply to this decision, Mr
Phillips has issued a letter inviting all
Council members to submit questions
to him before the 2nd of the month,
so that he can collect all relevant
information.
Blow job
This year's WolfFoundation Prize in
Chemistry has been won jointly by
Professor David M Blow, Head of the
Biophysics Department of Imperial
College, and Professor Sir David C
Phillips of Oxford.
They have received the award for
their long term work on improved
methods of X-ray crystallography in
order to determine the exact three-
dimensional structure of enzymes.
Prof Phillips solved the first animal
enzyme structure in 1965, while Prof
Blow determined the structure of a
much larger enzyme in 1967.
By a comparison of the various
enzymes Professor Blow also
demonstrated that the activity of
enzymes is shape-dependent.
In 1981 Professor Blow and his
collaborators conducted the first
experiments in protein engineering,
altering the action of enzymes by
changing some of their amino acid
building blocks.
The Foundation cites this work as
the key in "transforming the
mysteries of life into the language of
physical chemistry."
Double
Dutch
The papers for the sabbatical elections
were taken down by Dave Colley
(Returning Officer), with the arrival
of members of the Camborne School
of Mines. On their departure, the
following day, the papers were put
back up. This, however, did not
prevent a Dutchman, here for the
Hyde Park Relay, standing for
Deputy President.
Four people have put their name up
so far for the post of President. They
are James Beach (Chemistry), Bill
Goodwin (Mechanical Engineering),
Ian Howgate (Geology) and Guy
Perry (Physics). Jasper Gout (Maths
in Holland?) and Alan Rose (Doc)
have so far signed up for Deputy
President; Chas Jackson (Chemical
Engineering) for Honorary Secretary;
and Chris Edwards (Chemistry) and
Judith Hackney (Physics) for the post
of FELIX Editor.

Marks & Spencers...
FELIX rang College Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur this week.
He knows nothing.
Report out
ICU Academic Affairs Officer, Dave
Lowrie's report was rejected at
Monday's Council meeting. The
report included a controversial table
which listed the attendance of Dep
Reps at various meetings. Dep Reps
and other Council members objected
that some relevent meetings had not
been included and that not all of the
people who should have attended
were informed in advance. Their
major concern was, however, that
membership of such committees is
only one part of a Dep Rep's job.

Another Ratty Problem
Chris the rat is having hassles again.
Last term many of you worked out
how Chris could escape from the
horrific experiment being carried out
on him with the least amount of
damage. If you remember, Chris was
placed on a large chessboard pattern
and had to visit every square using the
smallest number of tums (since he got
an electric shock every time he made
one). Well they've done it to him
again. The rules this time are slightly
different. Chris has been placed on
the board in the top left-hand corner
and can only escape through a door
in the bottom right-hand corner. He
still gets a small electric shock every
time he makes a turn, but this time,
however, he can't step on any of the
black squares, since this causes a far
worse shock. The door will only open
after he has been through every white
square. Obviously he can only move
diagonally, and, although he can
travel through a square more than
once, the door will not open if he has
travelled through the same corner of
a square more than once.
So can you find the route which
minimises the number of shocks that
Chris'll get and stays on the white
squares? Answers by 1.00pm next
Wednesday, to me at the FELIX
office, please. Keep your comments,
criticisms,..etc coming in as well,
they're much appreciated.
Hexagonal Unsymmetry
All the solutions I got to this were
correct even though my wording of
the problem was slightly inaccurate.
Sorry. The correct solution is shown
below. The winner was Aldo
Tacconelli, Physics 1, well done.
