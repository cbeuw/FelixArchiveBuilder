Inter-Hall clash
Football
IC 1st XI 10, London
Hospital 1st XI 3
London
Hospital
thrashed
IC 1st XI Captain, Alex Lunghi, had
a sleepless night wondering what sort
of team he could put out against the
all conquering London Hospital side;
after all, IC were missing 6 first
choice players through illness,
interviews and assorted Valentine's
Day celebrations and LH, the leagues
runaway leaders, had only lost one
game all season in all competitions
and conceeded only 16 goals in the
league. However, IC were on a high
after 4 straight victories against
GHXM (7-1 and 2-0), QMC (4-1) and
MXUCH (4-1). So 9 IC players,
Miner Tim Fisher (who had just
finished playing for RSM) and on-
loan Paul Bravens were out to give
a good performance.
IC started solidly but neither side
showed any bite in front of goal.
However, after 15 minutes, LH took
the lead with a well-taken goal.
Bravens equalised for IC with an
equally well-taken goal 5 minutes
later, and Byron Wood's thunderous
left-foot volley put IC into the lead
almost immediately. LH equalised
controversially on the half-hour when
their winger seemed a mile offside,
but the goal stood. Bravens continued
the goal spree with a superb half-
volley which found the top corner.
Skipper Lunghi was well happy at
half-time with the score at 3-2.
IC started the second half well and
after a few minutes Jim Wilson found
the net after he had stayed up for a
corner.
LH pulled a goal back minutes later
with a scrambled goal and then piled
forward looking for the equaliser. The
turning point of the game came when
LH's "equaliser" was disallowed for
a well-spotted offside. IC's midfield
quartet of Adams, Cole, Olden and
West then literally took over in what
turned out to be a (illegible-
Typesetter) (3) (including a delicious
curling free-kick), Adams, Wood and
Bravens completing his hat-trick
finished the game off in style for IC
in a final score of 10-3.
Team: Allen, Fisher, Ewart, Lunghi
(Capt), Wilson, Adams, Cole, Olden,
West, Wood, Bravens.

Southside Derby
Sunday 15th February
Selkirk 1, Tizard 4
After a two week break, Selkirk Hall
football team took to the turf again
last Sunday. This time it was the big
one. Would Birmingham's tactics pay
off? Would Tonge return successfully
from injury? For some of the younger
players it was to be their first
Southside Derby—the chance of a
lifetime. Would they crack under the
pressure?
In the other camp, Captain Pete
Wallis had taken three weeks to
assemble a full strength Tizard side.
They were evidently physically and
psychologically honed to perfection.
The raw meat had been consumed.
They were ready and eager.
A near capacity crowd surged
forward with excitement as the red
shirted players of Selkirk kicked off.
The ball was soon worked via Holt
and Fasihi to Evenden who put
centreforward Tonge on his way. He

IC at Henley Fours Head
Mixed
fortune
Oarsmen from Imperial were covered
in glory at Henley^Fours Head (not
Henley Royal Regatta). It was
however, a day of mixed fortune.
Our senior A coxless four
impressed spectators by their speed
and power. This four may well have
stormed in to overall victory, had they
not been blocked by a rival crew,
which stopped in front of them
causing them to halt for several vital
seconds. Despite this incident they
came second overall and won the
senior A pennant.
dribbled and skillfully created a
shooting chance. The blast went
uncharacteristically wide—the
hamstring had gone again—this was
to prove Selkirk's downfall. Back to
form striker Persil Charlton entered
the game.
Encouraged, Tizard attacked in
droves and were soon 2-0 ahead. Led
by the skillful Morris and the physical
Birmingham, Selkirk fought back
with the former slotting home from
a goalmouth scramble. Retaliating
Tizard broke down the left, rounded
the excellent Haines and scored from
a rebound off the keeper (3-1).
A rousing team-talk, another
substitution (Calowell for Holt) and
first class defensive play by all,
enabled Selkirk to hold off the strong
Tizard attack in the second half, but
with their key man on the sidelines,
they really had no chance. Morris
blotted an otherwise clean second half
copybook by scoring a spectacular
own goal to give Tizard a flattering
4-1 win.
Selkirk will be entering two teams
in the soccer sixes. See you there!
Both the elite coxed four and senior
B coxless four won their respective
categories, even though oarsmen in
both crews felt that they could have
rowed much better. This put three
Imperial crews in the top eight out of
a field of over 150 boats.
But there was also a touch of
disaster for IC. The senior C crew
who were impressive throughout the
year were forced to row with
women's blades. They were also
forced to share their boat with the
novice women. This reflects the acute
shortage of equipment at the boat
club.
After a race in which they had to
raise too high to compensate for using
women's blades, the senior C crew
were shattered. But the bitterest blow
was to come. When the results were
announced they found that they had
come second in their division by a
mere 2 seconds.
Both the men's and women's
novices put up a creditable
performance and show promise for
the future.
