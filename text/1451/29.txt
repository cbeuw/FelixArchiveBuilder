Executioner: Not exact-
ly no. I may have loosely
based some of my charac-
ters on people I know but
they‛re completely fic-
tional. That is apart from
the film editor... I really
did catch him wanking over
Avatar.
Executioner:...no. He
also likes...actually, yeah
that‛s it
Executioner: ...but it was
floating about in a cloud
Executioner: ...but it had
a fiddle...and a moustache!
Executioner: ...it was a
fiddler crab!
Executioner: Ha. Your impru-
dence humours me. You think
I care about the thoughts of
Helix editors? Executioner
cares not for such simple-
minded morons. The humour is
simply above you Dane Wayne.
Executioner: I wanted to
do something different.

felix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010
Putting the cat out to dry
It‛s a Wednesday afternoon in
the cold and unwelcoming ‘Helix‛
basement. The Editor-in-Chief
of the ex-award-winning stu-
dent newspaper, Dane Wayne,
is not happy with ‘ Executioner‛,
What became of Lord Fiddler Crab? Will Xyron, our beloved hero, ever find love? Meanwhile...

FFS Dave u airbrushed twat! Ur policies r well
gay and lame. ur just a big gaybo. Hope u don’t
get 2 b prime min >:(

Hey Guyz. Gess wot Obie’s doin? Only
reformin da fuckin banks!! ;)
Meanwhile, Edgar Rock, the
Helix film editor, is busy writ-
ing his review for Avatar
Dane Wayne: A cartoon!? A
shitty cartoon!? What happen
to the beginner guides? They
were hirarious! No-one like
shitty cartoon! It not funny!
SexyOsama69
Aw dw Gor. I can pull a few strings if dat posh
gaybo wins ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
Dane Wayne: You pick on rug-
by team every week. how that
different? You‛re running out
of ideas. Can‛t you see you‛re
ruining your reputation around
correge? Even your fellow
Heerix editors are turning
against you.
Executioner: How dare
you!
Dane Wayne: Sorry Execu-
tioner. That was unfair of me.
Dane Wayne: There are two
things Imperial students like,
peurile jokes about sex and
puzzles. They fucking love
puzzles. Why can‛t you be
more rike coffee break?
Dane Wayne: Stop cutting to
unrerated scenes! That‛s the
probrem with you Executioner.
You‛re getting boring and pre-
dictable. I mean, a crab!? You
resorted to a fucking crab?
Dane Wayne: I don‛t give a
shit what it was! The fact is,
you wun out of ideas and re-
sort to a stupid talking animal!
Dane Wayne: But that‛s not
funny! It‛s just a crab with a
fucking violin and a moustache!
Dane Wayne: Look! This Xy-
borg character is too one-di-
mensional. He‛s just your ar-
chitypal Sci-fi geek.
Executioner: There have
only been two issues. You
haven‛t seen Xyron‛s many
depths. He really likes
horse-riding.
Dane Wayne: ...Is that it?
Dane Wayne: But I‛m not
China Man! I From Watford.
You‛re repracing the ‘L‛s with
‘R‛s. That‛s wacist! What have
you become Executioner?
You‛re not funny anymore. It‛s
almost like you‛ve rost interest
in this article now. I suggest
you give this shitty comic up
and go back to writing funny
stuff. Aggravated Nerd has
consistently managed to deriv-
er week in and week out, but
you‛ve lost your way. I‛ve seen
this happen to so many come-
dy writers. You‛ve burned out.
You resort to cheap racist hu-
mour and when you‛re strug-
gring to finish the shit-piece
of an article off, you just go
for some incohewent imprau-
sible and eraborate - What
the fuck is that sound? Oh no
prease don‛t touch the Macs!
And thus everyone learnt to shut the fuck up and leave
Hangman alone to do whatever the fuck he wants!
Dane Wayne: Well, let me
see what you‛ve written this
week. Wait a second...Is
that meant to be me!?
