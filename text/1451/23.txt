ou’ve always got to admire
a fashionista’s chutzpah.
It takes courage to wear
ripped tights while bar
hopping. It takes cour-
age to wear bold shoulders to col-
lege. When it comes to men’s fashion,
there’s only a very thin line between
looking stylish and looking like a
tranny. A friend (male) almost died
of shock when he saw a man wear-
ing a pair of skinny jeans - turned up
revealing a red pair of socks and kept
snugged with a knee length mink fur
coat. He was definitely living at the
fashion forefront in Shoreditch. Out-
side of Central London though, I’m not
sure if he’d even survive…
The Shoreditch crowd, for some
bizarre reason, always seem to don
major trends two seasons early. Look
at the trend dominating the Autumn/
Winter 2010 runway – furs, furs, furs,
furs - although they are pared down
versions of the knee length coat seen
on the tranny-looking man. (Tranny?
Stylish?)
Anyway, there are more plausible
ways of expressing your stylish self
without selling out your manly de-

meanour. Saskia Verhagen returns this
week to fill us in on the latest know-
hows in order to look nonchalantly
stylish. Nonchalance - a word that men
should bear in mind while attempting
any trend GQ may persuade you to
follow...
Lastly, just a thought, are gay men
generally more stylish than straight
men? if so, are they are more prone to
expressing themselves creatively and
artistically in terms of outerwear? If so,
why is this? Do they simply not care or
if they do, are they afraid of the inner
feminine side catching up with them?
Having said that, I’d much prefer to
have the mirror to myself in the morn-
ing, rather than having to force a style-
obsessed boyfriend out of the way just
to get a slice of the mirror.
My good friend Igor Ostrikov offers
his views on the straight versus gay is-
sue on fashion: some gays dress over-
the-top and they look hideous. Some
of them go to fashion parties and they
wear art but not clothes. On an every-
day basis, ties are straights who dress
as well as gays.
So there. The gays are still winning
the fashion marathon.
Fashion’s Rugged Gentleman
The week of uber-eliticist fashion
shows is back. The Spring 2010 season
of the highly exclusive Paris couture
show ended on Thursday the 28th after
a short schedule of only 5 days.
19 designers and classic fashion
houses completed the first four days
of the schedule with the last day of the
week reserved for artistic jewellery.
At the time of going to print Val-
entino has just closed his show. The
collection featured vibrant and youth-
ful short dresses that featured a lot
of the classic Valentino fine draping
and spiral-cut organza. Valentino has
renewed the idea of celebrating the
womanly curve by the brilliant draped
mummy-like bodysuit. The use of a
fluorescent palette which diverged
from the widespread candy floss col-
ours that have infested Spring (ready
to wear as well as couture runways) is
also very refreshing.
Jean-Paul Gaultier’s creations were
heavily influenced by ethnic tribes in
different parts of the globe. Straws,
chains, geometric origami, leaves,
feathers, spikes and leather pleating
with raw colours accompanied the
usual Gaultier strong-edged, slightly
fetishist style. Models looked like styl-
ised tribeswomen coming straight out
of an Amazon rainforest or a tribal
conference in the rural part of South-
east Asia.
Even Chanel has moved on from
the classic boucle and pearls. Models
donned sheer metallic leggings and
Lagerfeld-esque gloves in shiny silver-
clad leather. Elie Saab continues to
prove to the fashion world that he is
the man to look to if wedding dresses
are in question. Galliano again went
back to the Dior archive and created a
New Look dash Equestrian hybrid.
Paris Couture Roundup
R
ecently it has seemed
like the popular choice of
smart menswear has be-
come rather banal. The
looks are tediously cookie-cutter; it’s
close to impossible to differentiate
one insipid middle-class estate agent
with a bad suit and a worse personal-
ity from the next. My ideal personi-
fies more than an external projection
of ‘smartness’ – it requires a quiet
confidence, a quirk and a bit of in-
ternal angst. This is not your awful
generic city boy – this is a damaged
hero, a man with a purpose; the man
who left everything behind to ex-
plore the world, the cardiac surgeon
who fixed someone’s broken heart –
a man who embodies exactly what a
man really ought to be: this is James
Bond, Rhett Butler, Rick Blaine –
rugged heroes with a tainted past
and a fabulous wardrobe.
The rogue returns, shuns his daily
uniform, and dons instead a flawless
bespoke suit – but the nonchalantly
ruffled hair, the sense of insatiable
intent, the subtle air of he-
roic arrogance are all main-
tained. He becomes the
perfect oxymoron –
sexily dishevelled
and impeccably
put-together; a
man who seems not
to care much for
style, but knows
enough about
what looks good.
He has sufficient
confidence to
carry it off with
that enviable
semblance of, “Oh
this old thing? Had it
for years…”
The men’s runways
for Autumn/Winter
2010-11 were littered
with these haughty
masculine heroes. At
Louis Vuitton we saw
heavy tweeds and tailored trousers
combined with heavy leather military
boots, providing a hard edge to this
otherwise classic men’s look, all in a
pared-down palette of black, grey and
espresso. Raf Simons achieved a simi-
lar effect, taking a timeless charcoal
grey wool suit and adding the textural
variety of an acrylic black bomber
jacket or a thick patent-effect overcoat
effortlessly creating an easy, youthful,
sexy synthesis of fabrics and concepts
that ought to be totally incongruent.
At Cavalli we saw a type seemingly
inspired by the Gossip Girl character
Chuck Bass – the brighter palette
incorporating peacock blue and
crimson requires that extra touch
of intolerable conceit that
Chuck seems to have nailed.
A more casual look with a
bit more rockstar appeal in-
corporated the luxury of a
heavy navy double-breasted
overcoat with a thick fur
collar and a striped silk
scarf with a rugged rubber-
soled brogue.
Contrastingly, the clean,
classic lines were unmistak-
able at Ferregamo; the perfect
dove-grey wool Chesterfield coat
and then the fabulous collared
cardigan à la Steve McQueen in
forest green – probably my pick
of the season, and in a colour seen
everywhere during men’s fashion
week – paired with a band-collar
shirt in a similar
colour and tailored
dark green wool
suit trousers.
Effortless,
masculine
chic at its
very best.
Remem-
ber though,
gentlemen,
the key uni-
fying factor
in this time-
less trend is
confidence.
Convince your
potential damsels
that you are the
missing piece in
their personal life
epic without saying
a word, and watch
everything
else fall into
place…
