expect this time around, since the visi-
tors came with a completely different
squad.
Well – let’s face it – they never stood
a chance.
Imperial started with a strong de-
fence and forced Oxford to surrender
the ball early in attack, allowing the
hosts to run quick and very effective
counter attacks.
After a mere five minutes, there was
a four-goal cushion between the teams
that increased all the way throughout
the rest of the game.
The centre back players showed a lot
of individual class and surprised all of
the eight spectators with manoeuvres
that would baffle the Royal Ballet.
Midway through the first half some
rather questionable refereeing de-
stroyed the last hopes of even the most
optimistic Oxford players when their
best defender saw a red card for an of-
fence that none of the players from Im-
perial or Oxford actually saw.
The comfortable lead gave Imperial
the confidence to attempt some more
complex schemes in the second half in
order to broaden their attacking pat-
tern for the upcoming games against
the best teams from England, Scotland
and ultimately France.
At the end of the game a fifteen-
goal gap separated the two teams, but
“there is no room for complacency”
said Coach Marc Fayemi, who de-
scribed the game as “très bien!”.
The Imperial Eagles are determined
to work hard on their performance
in the next weeks to ensure they can
extend their unbeaten run by beating
local rivals UCL in the London derby
next week, before reaching for domes-
tic and european glory, with a firm eye
on those shiny silver trophies in Man-
chester and Lyon.

Right. As it turns out, annoyingly
enough for a sports editor, predictions
aren’t my strong suit. Not giving much
credence to Andy Murray’s Australian
Open bid last week turns out to have
been a mistake. It seems now that the
only player capable of halting Murray’s
scorching progress through the tour-
nament (up to the quarters, the Brit
had yet to drop a set) is the king of ten-
nis himself, Roger Federer.
The equally superlative Swiss has so
far played some very impressive tennis;
it seems that the rough patch occurring
towards the end of last year was simply
Roger getting used to a slightly differ-
ent style of play. By adapting a more
upcourt position and striking the ball
earlier, Federer reduces his footwork
and gets across the court quicker. Ac-
cording to the experts this induces less
fatigue, and means that Fed can look
forward to many more years of high-
level competiton. Which can only be
good news for us spectators. More
spectacular games, more bitter rival-
ries and more broken records await.
Speaking of rivals, one thing has
come to attention about this year’s
Aussie open. I’m talking about the
demise of Nadal, who despite playing
some very good tennis up to, and dur-
ing, the Murray quarter-final was let
down by his knees midway through
the third set. The Spaniard has been
bothered by injury for some time now,
and I sincerely hope that this isn’t the
beginning of the end for him. Sure, he’s
already won six Grand Slams at the age
of twenty-three. But for such a bright
star to burn out so soon would be a
loss to the world of sport.
Returning to Federer, if he does win
this one he’ll equal Andre Agassi’s
record of 4 wins down under in the
Open era. But (and somehow I know
that I’m going to get it wrong again) I’ll
be rooting for Muray to be the first Brit
to win an Open since 1936. C‘mon,
Andy.
All right, that’s all I’m going to say
about tennis for a while, I promise. The
problem is that if I stop talking about
tennis I’m going to have to start talking
about football, which is a subject that
tends to somewhat polarize a sporting
audience.
I’m assuming you’re a sporting au-
dience, of course, because let’s face
it: the people who read this aren’t the
ones who spend all their free time star-
ing at a screen. You are a geek, in your
own particular way-don’t deny it, you
wouldn’t be here otherwise - but you
balance that geek with just the right
amount of jock (or in the case of Rugby,
perhaps a bit too much jock). Thank
god this place actually has people who
see the point of running after a football
or a Frisbee every week while freezing
your arse off or drowning in mud. That
said, the only way Imperial will actu-
ally top the BUCS university league
table is if they recognize MMORPGs
as a sport.
In any case, thanks for turning your
felix around every week, and even
looking inside the back cover from
time to time. If you have any sugges-
tions, or requests as to what you’d like

Please send in you reports. We would
love to hear from you! Though, when
referring to people can you refrain
from using nicknames. Though
they’re fun and mildly banterous at
best, anyone reading it years later
will not have a clue who these indi-
viduals are. Thanks!)

the match was fitness, since this was
the first time many had exercised in a
month!
When the opposition arrived having
taken the scenic route via Heathrow,
the match eventually started.
Imperial dominated from the start
taking an early lead and were 3-0 up at
half time thanks to goals from Soraya,
Ellie and Carina.
Our Christmas lack-of-practise un-
fortunately began to show in the sec-
ond half with many tired legs.
Despite the fatigue, we still managed
to score one more goal without con-

ceding, and the game eventually fin-
ished 4-0 to Imperial.
The victory means we move on to
the semi-finals of the reserve cup, to
play either the Royal Veterinary Col-
lege or Royal Holloway.
Credit has to go to King’s medics
who only had nine players but still
managed to make Imperial’s lives dif-
ficult at times.
The women’s 2s were back in action
on the Wednesday playing Bucking-
hamshire at home.
Again, they were strong from the be-
ginning with solid defending allowing
the midfield and forwards to push up
and put pressure on the Buckingham-
shire New University’s defence.
Some great hockey and well-re-
hearsed set pieces kept Imperial in the
opposition’s half for the majority of the
game, smothering the Bucks team.
Fantastic goals from Soraya, Ellie,
Amanda, Annabel and Hilary brought
the ladies another well deserved win
with an 8-0 rout being the final score.
IC ladies’ hockey 2nds. Of course they’re smiling, they just won 8-0. You’d be smiling too
