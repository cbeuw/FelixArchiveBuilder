Anyhoo, the winner of the Inter-

How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then send
the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. You will
not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate - just
solve it like normal and insert the letter that you believe
makes the word.

I
’ve been thinking, well, com-
plaining and moaning is prob-
ably more accurate. Last Sunday,
I frequented the bar with Mr.
Philpott of the ground breaking quote-
‘who needs women? Women are for
gays.’ That, my friends, is what the elite
firms of this world like to call ‘blue-sky
thinking’- whatever the fuck that really
means, I’ll leave it to you. In one fell
swoop I had to re-evaluate my whole
outlook on life, it didn’t take long as it
turned out that Philpott was being a
phenomenal twat. I ramble… yes bar.
So sitting in Da Vinci’s after a day try-
ing to splaff out Entrepreneurship re-
vision, but in reality just pissing about,
we took on the role of your classic pe-
culiar old men grumbling in the corner.
You know, there is always one per pub,
and he usually has a few stories that he
simply must bore your tits to the floor
with. Unless you happen to be haunt-
ing the exclusive Public House that is
The Goose on North End Road. That
place is rammed like three fat men in a
lift designed to take only two fat men.
Seriously it’s fucking weird. Last year
there was an offer on giving you a free
stab vest if you had nine pints- I could
tell that things were about to kick off
so I got out of there. I actually have
no real evidence to back that claim
up, but it’s that type of place, use your
creative instinct. Besides it’s their own
fault that they attract such obscure
clientele- with Foster’s (or what they
call Foster’s) at £1.87 a pint you’re go-
ing to get some Class A retards kick-
ing about. What do they want? A slap
round the head? Yes, they do.
I ramble… yes the bar. That place
was a shitting train wreck. I don’t claim
to still have a fully functional brain, in
fact I know a good chunk of it is miss-
ing and I’m partly unhinged. Never-
theless I have never, not even once, felt
that I need to wear a lycra wife beater
to the bar. Literally never, essentially,
if I was asked to define acceptable bar
wear, lycra would not feature highly on
my list, if at all, not even if it weren’t
fucking snowing outside. This didn’t
anger me, because to be fair, he was
up and dressed, so what more do you
want? Now, if he’d flopped his wang
out and started to exemplify the finer
art of the windmill, without question,
I would have been very much less than
impressed. Actually, I’d have made the
apocalypse look like a fucking sparkler.
Aside from that small episode my
week, as I sure you are itching to know
about, has been relatively nondescript.
Stuff Imperial
students don’t like:
Sorry? You are planning on doing
what to this bus? Holding it here
for a short while? Well for how long
is this proposed while? I want facts
and figures. I have places to be,
people to see, and things to fucking
do. Besides, this bus smells of piss
and if that kid doesn’t stop crying
I’m going to belt him.
You can’t even drink on the bus
anymore to try and get you through
it. Probably a good thing, because
I would assume that the number
of glassing incidents would go up
about ten fold whenever that mes-
sage is played. What are they hop-
ing to achieve by holding a bus for
an indeterminate amount of time?
The nature of the bus service is in-
herently to fuck up so no amount
of ‘holding’ will ever ‘regulate the
service.’ Besides, people expect a
shit service so what’s the point of
trying to higher our expectations?
It’ll then be less of a chore to get the
bus, and we won’t be able to blame
rocking up to a lecture 20 minutes
late on the shitting buses.
Funnily enough, I’ve never heard
that message played on a night bus.
No need to ‘‘regulate’’ services people
hardly go on? I’ve almost been killed
four times by fucking mental drivers
who want to get back to the depot
in record time. Apparently, that also
includes picking up passengers, thus
rendering the whole exercise useless.
mmmmmm.....

Wordpath 1,451
INTERMEDIATE
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

EVIL (An)
There were many
solutions this week.
On average 10 steps.
That was until this
4 step solution was
submitted by new
face Steve Malkin
and obliterated the
competition!
Had a little think about the recession
and the banking crisis because it tied
neatly in with a rant at a certain com-
pany who can’t be named. All I can say
is that they provide loans, and gener-
ally to students. I should feel sorry for
Lucy, but in fairness if she’s going to
act like a cunt, then I’m going to treat
her like a cunt. In reply to my question
‘how much is the maintenance loan for
a final year student in London?’ she
gets back to me with ‘I don’t know.’
Pressing her further I enquire- ‘no idea
at all?’, she helpfully replied ‘no, none’,
so I throw some figures down ‘well, is
it 10p or 10 grand?’. Communications
were beginning to break down, that
much was obvious, but Lucy in her
infinite wisdom managed to come up
with the fucking Mt. Everest of wank
replies, ‘I don’t know, it could be either.’
No love it can’t. Even I know that you
stupid fucking bint. So, generally, the
reaction wasn’t good.
I also got a complaint from an Amer-
ican about the ‘What IC Students Like’
piece. I know it was all in good hu-
mour, but I was in the bar. Drinking.
So if you really don’t like it, have you
ever considered- you know, just con-
sidered- fucking off and reading some-
thing else?
What the fuck is that? Shit! Americans
