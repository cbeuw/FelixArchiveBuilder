Kadhim - Let’s start by talking about
the third phase of the Beit Redevelop-
ment. What’s the vision?
Ashley - Our aim is to create an atmos-
phere where people feel like they’ve got
a high quality product but not extor-
tionate prices. We want to have a venue
that’s for students but that’s also really
good quality.
K - You’ve been asking for student input
into the redevelopment. How has that
been?
A - I’ve found that people just doo-
dle or draw jacuzzis on the plans; we
haven’t had a lot of positive input. If
students want to have input then they
should give proper ideas, otherwise
we’ll do what we think is right, and if
that turns out to be wrong, well we’ve
given students a chance.
K - Don’t you think that if the union ac-
tively went out, face-to-face to get stu-
dent input, it would work better?
A - We did actually go around the JCR
with the plans for the redevelopment
showing them to students. We got some
good ideas but most people, like I said,
just messed about. The feedback hasn’t
been as good as we’d hoped but if stu-
dents don’t submit ideas then there’s no
way we can take it into account. We’re
still working on the plans so there’s still
a lot of space for student’s ideas and
comments to be worked into it. We
also have a working group of around 10
students which has provided good feed-
back so it hasn’t all been bad.
K - Do you think that the problems with
say, dBs, are a bit overblown?
A - The bar service capacity, even with
the mobile bar, is terrible. With the re-
development, the bar will be twice as
big so on busy nights there won’t be a
problem with getting drinks. In terms
of getting students into dBs, it’s been
much busier this year on Wednesdays
and Fridays since we’ve tweaked the
music lineup. Once you’ve got com-
pletely pissed, you just want cheesy
music and to dance around. So we’ve
given them that and it’s been a lot bus-
ier in dBs.
K - A large part of the renovation of dBs
involves turning it into a high quality
live music venue, but what’s the point
when like you say, it’s drunken cheesy
music that’s pulling people in?
A - One of the key things that came out
of the Trading Survey 18 months ago
was that students wanted to see more
live music. And we also want students
to be proud to come over here and
say “Well, actually we’ve got a really
good Union”. Which means, on Sports
Night, then we cater to the situation
but on say, a Friday, we can put on
some good live bands.
K - Well this year a “Freshers Festival”
was held, with live acts. It wasn’t a wild
success you might say. You’re aiming
to have more live music, but does that
sit well with the failure of the “Freshers
Festival?”
A - The problem with the Freshers
Festival was that it was a week after a
heavy freshers week. We should have
lumped it in with Fresher’s Week, in-
cluded it with the marketing for that
and dropped the price, then it would
have worked a bit better. And there’s a
difference between doing a live gig on
a Friday night and doing a whole week-
end of music.
K - One of your manifesto points has
been to have more student input into
the planning of Union events. What
have you done so far to achieve that?
A - At Southampton university, their
executive committee (which is made
up of students) receives the term plan-
ner in advance and can say we want
this to change or we want to tweak this.
So we’re going to bring that method in.
But what I’ve wanted to do, which is
the best way to ensure that students are
getting what they want, is to get clubs
to hold events at the Union and sup-
port them doing that.
K - How’s that worked out?
A - Not as well as I hoped if I’m hon-
est, mainly because I’ve been running
around doing so much other stuff.
What I’ve found is that I’ve got less
than a day a week, if that, to work on
my manifesto points, and the rest of my
time is spent trying to stop the Union
crashing down around me.
K - So you’ve found that the demands of
your job day-to-day mean that it’s quite
hard to reach out to students?
A - Yes, much more difficult than I
imagined. During Freshers Week we
connected well with a lot of students.
I must have spoken to hundreds of stu-
dents that week. But then term starts
and everything kicks off. You’ve got to
help individual students with problems
and there are committees to go to; you
find that you’re running around all the
time. After the initial burst in Fresher’s
week it’s been more difficult.

K - Let’s talk about the changes in da-
Vinci’s. What’s happening there?
A - We’re going to change the design
of the kitchens because we don’t need
them in their current state. The Tower
Rooms has damaged our lunchtime
trade. The idea is to have a grill kitchen
like the Prince Regent, which doesn’t
take up a lot of space, but they can
still cook a lot. But we’re still discuss-
ing what that lunchtime trade will be,
and actually that would be quite a good
thing for students to have input in. I
think we still need to keep some form
of lunchtime food at the union, but it’s
whether we stick with hot food or just
a sandwich bar.
K - The catering is quite a financial
burden on the Union right?
A - Lunchtime catering was losing us
around £80,000 a year, we’ve made
some changes which reduced this to
around £40,000 a year but it’s getting
better still. If we were making a profit,
then we’d keep it in its present state but
with a new venue it’s a good time to
think about what students want.
K - Why do you think that students
would rather eat at say, the Library
Cafe, than the Union?
A - I think it has something to do with
the location, and what we are capable
of serving. The kitchens are so old and
knackered we cannot produce some-
thing of the same quality as say, the
Tower Rooms. When I was a fresher
there would be a massive queue in dBs
for baguettes at lunchtime, but then
the JCR started offering baguettes and
people didn’t come over anymore, so
our location is a disadvantage.
K - Let’s talk about food in the evening.
