Ladies’ hockey victorious
Thanks to an unfortunate run of can-
celled games, the ICHC women’s 1s
played their first game in seven weeks
against a challenging St. George’s
Medical School team, in the ULU
Challenge Cup quarter-finals.
This was a game not to be lost, since
the women’s 1s have been in the final
of this competition for at least the last
three years.
Imperial started strong, going 1-0 up
early into the first half, with a beautiful
piece of passing play, cleanly finished
by Lab Rat. Not suffering so much
from the slippery pitch as in the men’s
earlier game, Imperial – particularly
between Vommi, Prince Charles and
the forward line – managed to produce
some great play, pressuring St George’s
heavily at times. On occasion the St
George’s solid centre-back gave her
team a chance to break, but the flow
was always stemmed by our firm de-
fensive lines.
At half time, Imperial were 1-0 up,
and still awaiting the arrival of a 12th
player in the form of a perennially-late
Preying (or is it Praying…?)Mantis. St
George’s mounted a strong comeback
in the second half, and early on scored
a messy goal, taking advantage of a
moment of inattentive defending from
the whole team.
The arrival of super-sub PM helped
us to regain the balance, scoring a goal
within her first two minutes on the
pitch with a superb top-D shot, and
taking Imperial 2-1 up. Another lucky
goal from St Georges – eventually
making it past SuperSaver after three
attempts – took it back to a draw, but
in the last five minutes, the Women’s
1s managed to rescue the win, with an-
other Preying Mantis goal.
The women’s 1s move on to the cup
semi-finals, where our next opponents
are likely to be GKT – winners of last
year’s final.

Inspired by the European Handball
Championships in Austria, the Impe-
rial Eagles play their best game yet and
cruised to a convincing victory over
rivals Oxford.
The game played in East London on
Sunday marked the half-way point of
the season and was very encouraging
in many aspects and of crucial impor-
tance in the preparation for the UK
Handball University Championships
in Manchester next month.
Games against Oxford University
are always very prestigious and de-
spite having defeated them at the end
of the last term, no one knew what to
