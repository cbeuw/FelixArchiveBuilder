The big problem that has arisen recently is the presence of a steel
pillar in the nightclub and its close proximity to the new stage.
The pillar obscures part of the stage area and could be a problem
when it comes to hosting live bands in the new nightclub. We are
currently looking at ways of removing the pillar however they look
set to be costly and very time consuming. Look at the image below
and give us your views on what to do…
Do we really need to spend the time and money on removing this
pillar?
Will this pillar prevent bands from touring this venue?
