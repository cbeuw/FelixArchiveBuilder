Follow-scopes; staring at you from behind a bush
This week’s horoscopes wants your toes in its dutty mouth. Dat is bare sket, m8. His periscope sees them good
Cancer
You’re checking your
friend’s statuses on
facebook. ‘Lizzie had
a really good night :D’
,
‘Mark had a bit too
much to drink lol’ ‘Alex
has been bumraped by a lesbo’
. You sigh. You’ve
just realised how shit your friends are. You go
back to myspace and take a cleverly angled photo
to disguise the fat ugly truth. You customize your
homepage with flowers and an illegible font.
Virgo
This week your purple
womb ferret decides
it’s going to talk to you.
“Thrust me between
the juicy beef flaps of
your mother otherwise
I’ll implode spreading the BAD AIDs throughout
Madagascar.” Enough cheek! You reach for the
nearest sledgehammer. SPLATMONGS, the
sound of your flaccid member crushed into
oblivion.
Gemini
This week things start
moving around, and
you think you have a
demon in your house.
You’ve just seen
Paranormal Activity
and you’re shit scared. You set up a camera and
everything, just like the film. You’re going to
make millions. You look back at the 246 hours of
footage you’ve got. Turns out it’s just a feral goat
loose in your house.
Pisces
This week, you’re
arguing with your
mother when you get
an erection. You’re
confused but there’s
something arousing
about your mother angry and ranting about the
economic downturn ending and how she wants a
new blender. Pon de Floor by Major Lazer starts
playing in your heard, and you’ve spunked your
pants. Your mum buys the new blender.
Leo
You’re really getting
yourself into trouble
with this ketamine
thing. You’re so
desperate for a wobbly
high that you’ve taken
up a Veterinary degree for seven years just so
you can get real horse tranquilizer. Intravenous
ketamine really hits the spot. Well, it’s 2017 and
you’ve found yourself a vet, shame you’ve lost
your thumbs and sense of sour. OH, KETAMINE.
Aries
This week your
landlord comes round
demanding the last 6
months rent. Realis-
ing your house is a
death trap anyway,
you shove him down the stairs. You tell the
police that is was down to the shit state of the
property and get free rent for the rest of the year.
Then you realise you can’t be arsed to write two
more lines for this stupid horoscope.
Scorpio
I WILL FUKIN’
SHANK U LIKE DER
IZ NO TMRW, M8.
I IZ GUNA END U,
HU DO U FINK U R,
SUM BATTY BOI? LK
AT DAT FRINGE, LKE SUM MOSHER LITTLE
SHIT. Sorry, I have Tourrette’s. What was I saying?
Oh yeah. I AM GOING TO END YOUR LIFE BE-
CAUSE I DISAGREE WITH YOUR CLOTHES.
MY PEANUT OF A BRAIN ISN’T WORKING.
Libra
This week you buy a
cape. You put it on and
feel the immense sense
of power. You put
your cape to the test
and jump off Queen’s
tower. You’re dead. You’re slightly annoyed at
this revelation. You get to heaven. God turns out
to be an atheist. You both laugh at the irony. God
has a cape, but it’s much better than yours. You
get jealous. God has a really nice handbag as well
Taurus
You’re in the shower
and you hear some
rustling outside of
your window. Your
cheap landlord
didn’t install frosted
windows to your bathroom, and well, the blinds
are pretty much see-through. You peer through
them to see a travelling freakshow bewildered
by the microscopic size of your penis. They offer
you a job there. THE NO-PENIS MAN!
Capricorn
This week you wake
up and find yourself
copulating a brick wall
in the Irish countryside.
It’s a gritty affair, but
you find it weirdly
comforting. The rawness isn’t sexy, but it’s
definitely better than watching porn and wanking
to dead-eyed women. You finish up and can’t find
your trousers. You see a cow in the distance and
it’s chewing away at your new khakis. Fuck. Pint?
Aquarius
So, you’ve got a girl
back to your flat.
This is the first time
you’ve managed to
score since you’ve
come to the inbred
shithole that is Imperial College. The night
goes well, you last more than your record time
of 47 seconds but you wake up and find she’s
dead. Like stone-cold dead. FUCK. You start to
look for a turkey-carver......

Sagittarius
You find some vaseline
on the floor and you
look around to see
whose it is. There’s
no one about, so you
open it up. There’s an
imprint of someone’s bellend in it. You’re caught
between being disturbed and unusually aroused.
You see if your bell-end makes a bigger imprint,
but it turns out it’s actually your vaseline and
your bellend-print in the first place. Oh.
