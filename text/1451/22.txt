The apperance of The Beatles
in this top-ten is amazing, it
shouldn’t be amazing really, seeing
as a top-ten chart ought to be the
best available music to listen to
at the current time. Seeing as The
Beatles’ music is available for free
on lastfm, I’m surprised it’s only
charted now.

Wolfmother face-melt with 70’s
rock at the Brixton Academy
Jonathan Richens gets taken back in time with Wolfmother
T
he Australian four-piece
Wolfmother, returning
to the UK for the first
time since 2008, took to
the stage at the Brixton
Academy and could be seen per-
forming songs from thier new album
‘cosmic egg’. This new album hails a
U-turn in their music direction, with
harder and faster guitar playing and
an unmistakable Black Sabbath in-
fluence, clashing on stage with thier
old ‘Led Zepplin’ style classic rock.
Read any review of Wolfmother and
you’ll undoubtably find a compari-
son to Led Zepplin, and with good
reason. All their riffs and singing
styles, they seem to have borrowed
from 70’s rock royalty and then sold
back at a resonable price with an
australian twist. Its kind of like a
subway sandwich doing low fat fish
and chips, and somthing just doesn’t
feel right.
Anyway, although they’re an easy
band to musically tear apart, the truth
of the matter is they deliver incread-
ibly tight psy-rock and the punters
Rock so hard his own face is melting
love it. The crowd is predominantly
middle aged men in leather jackets
and early teen greebo’s, but they
hang on every note like a spaniel
dangling from a postmans arm.
The gig started with their rock and
roll ‘dimension’, followed by a more
moody, Doors-sounding ‘carnival’,
showing that the band can display
more diversity than the average rock
band these days (whatever that sta-
tistic may be). Classical rock is a nice
juxtaposition to the modern music
scene, where new bands strive to
make their music more punchy and
fresh, and its appeal is obvious to any
young soul runined by dubstep. But
I’m not quite convinced that the solu-
tion is to copy great bands and create
dated music that makes the Brixton
Academy feel like a pub gig.
