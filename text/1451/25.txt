Apple’s latest creation named: iPad
I
f you haven’t heard by now Apple
had an event on Wednesday this
week at the Yerba Buena Center in
San Francisco. After all the hype,
could the much rumoured Apple tablet
possibly deliver?
Apple is aiming the iPad (not the iS-
late, iTablet or iPod HD/Maxi) to fit in
between your laptop and smartphone,
a device space that doesn’t necessarily
exist at the moment that is normally
covered by the netbook or eReader. If
you had your hopes pinned on a fully
fledged tablet computer I’m afraid I’m
going to have to disappoint you, the
iPad is essentially just a giant iPod
touch. It may have a few fancy fea-
tures like a 9.7 inch screen and an
Apple developed 1GHz processor
named the A4, but essentially it’s the
same capacitive-touch screen experi-
ence you are already familiar with.
On-board the device you’ve got
custom versions of the usual apps
you’ve come to expect on Apple iDe-
vices: iTunes and the iTunes store
including the App Store, Maps, Cal-
endar, Mobile Safari and email, each
looking like a cross between what
you find on a Mac and the iPhone.
The main difference comes when
you explore the greater real-estate
provided by the new screen size.
The Email app for instance provides
an experience similar to that of a
desktop with a two-pane view dis-
playing a list and an email preview.
Likewise browsing on the iPad is
like that on the desktop with a fair-
ly standard 1024x768 display.
Something that’s brand new for
the iPad is Apple’s movement into
the eBook market with iBooks. Es-
sentially aiming to be the iTunes
music store of books coupled with
an eBook reader application on
the iPad, the iBooks store allows
you to buy and read ePub books.
I’m not sure what the screen read-
ing experience is going to be like
on that LCD, but Amazon should
definitely be scared.
Text is entered on iPad via a
virtual chiclet-style keyboard
which looks like a cross between
that found on an iPhone and a
MacBook.
The iPad essentially runs
iPhone OS and therefore can
run almost all App Store apps
either at native or 2x resolu-
tion with more iPad specific
apps in the works including an
iPad version of iWork.
The iPad will be available
with WiFi only in 60 days from
$499 and WiFi+3G in 90 days
from $649. International pricing
and data contracts are TBA.
