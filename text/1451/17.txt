2010: A film odyssey ( hopefully)
Ed Knock takes a look at the most anticipated films of the year
Precious - January 29
Let’s ignore Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement who
jumped on the bandwagon after Precious won the
Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. The film’s subject
about child abuse is apparently very harrowing
but inspirational none the less. Critics have raved
about all the cast’s performances including the
screen debut of Gabourey Sidibe and a tender
appearance by Mariah Carey.
Invictus - February 5
Morgan Freeman finally gets his chance on the
role he was born to play - Nelson Mandela. And
with Clint ‘never makes dud’ Eastwood behind the
camera, Invictus looks set for a lot of nominations
in March. Feedback is positive, with Matt Damon’s
portrayal of Springbok captain François Pienaar
being especially praised though some Rugby fans
have been mumbling about the accuracy of the
scenes involving the game.
The
Scouting
Book
for
Boys
-
March
19
There is lot of excitement
about this directorial
debut from Tom Harper
whose short films have
won awards from BAFTA.
From the trailer it looks like
traditional kitchen sink fare
involving burning caravans
and lost children. If you
enjoy anything by Shane
Meadows and Ken Loach
then the chances are you’re
going to enjoy this film.
Thomas Turgoose, the fastest
rising star in British cinema,
confidently fills the boots of
the film’s protagonist who
finds himself out of his depth
after a little lie goes wrong.
Shutter Island -
February 29
2010 is already a better year than
2009. Why? Because the great Martin
Scorsese returns with his latest
masterpiece since The Departed.
Scorsese turns his attention to the
horror/thriller genre, an interesting
choice for the veteran director famous
for his ‘Mob’ films. The film looks
fantastic from the trailer, my only fear
is that Marty may use too many stupid
camera tricks which nearly wrecked
The Departed. Alas still no Bobby
de Niro but Leo de Caprio is a great
stand-in.
Films on the Iraq
War are slowly
starting to emerge,
though not like
the onslaught of
Vietnam films
are parents were
subjected to. First
we had the brilliant
The Hurt Locker and
now Green Zone is
promised to be a
gritty thriller delving
into the secrets of
those pesky WMD’s.
Green Zone
Tron Legacy -
December 26
Rumours of a sequel to the 1982 cult
film Tron have been circulating for
years, and now a film has materialised.
Jeff Bridges is back, he has a son and
might be a baddy. But who cares?
The light bikes are back too and look
awesome! A teaser trailer is already
online for the film which should
contain your excitement...for now.
Inception - August 13
I would be easier to find out the colour of Pope’s
underwear than to discover the plot of this film, such is it’s
secrecy. Christopher Nolan describes it as “a science fiction
thriller set in the architecture of the mind” and that’s all
we know. However from the teaser trailer, Inception looks
incredible involving crazy folding cities.
Spring
Summer
Winter
February 12 - A Single Man
A gay professor in L.A. struggles with
the death of his long term partner.
February 12 - Ponyo
Hayao Miyazaki will delight the world
once again with his latest anime.
February 19 - Crazy Heart
Jeff Bridges plays an alcoholic ex-country
music star who tries to get his life back.
March 5 - Alice in Wonderland
A sequel to Through the Looking Glass
instead of the original book. Mental.
April 2 - Kick Ass
Another fresh take on superhero genre.
Looks very watchable though.
April 7 - Cemetery Junction
New Ricky Gervais and Stephen
Merchant ‘insurance salesman’ comedy.
May 14 - Robin Hood
Ridley Scott’s serious take on the legend,
it looks terrible from the trailer.
May 28 - Prince of Persia
What? Jake Gyllenhaal in an action film
based on a computer game? Yup!
June 11 - Get him to the Greek
Russell Brand resumes his role of Aldous
Snow. Guaranteed laughs.
July 23 - Toy Story 3
Buzz and Woody are back! Andy’s grown
up and the toys are thrown out. Oh no!
July 30 - The A Team
Bum buh bum buuhhh! Da dan daaaaah!
BA and friends pity some fools.

World

exes of his new girlfriend with a sword!
September 3 - The Other Guys
It all goes wrong when two cops try to
attain the heights of their star colleagues

A professional boxer’s relationship with
his older brother, sounds like Raging Bull
