Aunty McPickle loves seafood, but hates food and sea
Dear Aunty McPickle,
At a recent house party I spotted an
opportunity to get with a reasonably
fit, unsuspecting girl. I took her back
to mine but hadn’t noticed the rather
bulbous spot on her chin, which half
way through sex started to weep.
The spot literally climaxed with a
huge expulsion of pus. I am now
tarred with spot sex nightmares.
How can I make it stop?
Spence Spoonful
Dear Spence,
Crikey. I think you should only get with
girls with decidedly perfect complex-
ions from now on. Although it might be
a bit shallow, it should help to get rid of
your association.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
After a night out last week I stum-
bled into a bed harbouring one of
my friends. I decided to try my luck
and let my hands stray over to her;
we were soon mauling away at each
other.
It was quite a while before I realised
she had previously thrown up a sea
food risotto all over the pillow. How
do I ever cleanse myself?
Howard Henner
Dear Howard,
Mmmmmm I think the friend must be
pretty embarrassed about this, it might
be best to make a joke about the whole
thing. Maybe offer to cook her din-
ner and conveniently serve up risotto.
Also try to avoid taking advantage of
wrecked friends or you may acquire a
rapist nick name such as “Spooner”.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am currently in the middle of par-
ticularly heavy revision sesh and
desperately need some instant sexu-
al satisfaction.
How should I go about this in the li-
brary? Please help, my balls on near
bursting point.
Yours Baz
Dear Baz,
There is one simple answer GO HOME
AND WANK.
Please don’t even consider pleasur-
Imagine this fella coming up as you pound ya missus. He’s like the lobster of bad sex. You know you’ve pulled a munter when you get a glimpse of him.
ing yourself in the libraries hideous
domains. I suggest picking yourself up
some man kleenex on the way home too.
Yours, Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I was having sex with possibly the fit-
test girl at Imperial and consequently
was the “cum cliff” the whole time. She
seemed to be enjoying herself until
after an embarrassing 5 minutes I acci-
dently came, and to make things worse
I also muttered the line “Whoopps I
came”
. She seemed mighty disgruntled
and will probably not invest any en-
ergy in attempting another shot. How
can I last longer in the future?
Colin Cumbucket
Dear Colin,
I have heard many tips to help you con-
trol your load. Premature ejaculation
is caused by a weakness in your sexual
parasympathetic nerves and the mus-
cle. I’ve heard that it helps to imagine
repulsive people like your grandma?
Or else from sex and masturbation un-
til you see a significant improvement in
your ejaculation control.

O
n Wednesday 27th Jan-
uary, ICU RAG teamed
up with Cambridge,
Loughborough, LSE
and UCL to raid Lon-
don for Barnardos childrens charity. A
Rag Raid is a full day event where vol-
unteers dress up and
collect either
at Tube
sta-
tions or on the streets from the unsus-
pecting public. Best fancy dress defi-
nitely goes to our very own Imperial
RAGgers Izzy and Jon who dressed up
as pandas!
The day started off early for Lough-
borough and Cambridge, who began
collecting at 7am in order to catch the
morning commuters. It was, however,
well worth it! At around midday,
Imperial, LSE and one lonely UCL
collector joined in on the fun. Al-
though UCL was meant to pro-
vide 20-30 collectors, they once
again proved that they are all a
waste of oxygen. We’ve decided
to pay them back during our
RAG Week Raid in March,
more information to
follow...
After a long day
which ended at about
10pm, the total sum
raised was just shy
of £4000. The night
ended very drunk-
enly for most of
us at the RCSU
sports Night
whose profits of
£500 will be do-
nated to the Haiti
Appeal.
The theme for
the night was “Car-
toon and TV Show
Characters”, and we
got a plethora of dis-
Take that London! You’ve been raided!

Chloe Man, the winner of the best costume prize
guises, ranging from classics, such as
a gaggle of Smurfs to one man who
was dressed as Man-with-a-Black-
Hat from the xkcd webcomics. Chloe
Man, however, walked away with an
iPod Shuffle for making a lovely Sailor
Moon.
On top of this, an epic bike auction
was held on Tuesday, which raised
£567, which will go to Haiti as well. A
bake sale on Friday (29th January) at
the JCR will bring our Haiti collections
to an end, so why not drop by and do
something sweet for the victims of this
terrible disaster.
Many thanks go out to everyone
who donated and helped out with this
week’s collections!
In the pipeline this term, we have an-
other raid coming up in collaboration
with Kingston University, as well as our
very own RAG Week in March, where
there’ll be five whole days of madness
for charity. The highlight of the week
will be our very own RAG Raid, which
will not only involve collections, but
a to-do list full of stunts that will take
you all over the city. Previous years
have seen people swim in the fountains
at Trafalgar Square, serenade Swedish
tourists at Covent Garden, as well as
streak through the Bank of England.
To keep informed about upcoming
RAG events, drop us a line at rag@im-
perial.ac.uk and we’ll add you to the
mailing list.
