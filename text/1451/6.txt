Somali jihad recruitment at universities
Around a dozen British Islamic stu-
dents from some of Britain’s top Uni-
versities are travelling to Somali to join
Al-Shabaab, an extremist rebel organi-
sation with links to Al-Qaeda. The or-
ganisation has been blamed for many
deaths, and Somali leaders in the UK
say students from LSE, King’s College
London and Imperial are among those
who have been recruited within the
past year.
Following the case of Umar Fa-
rouk Abdulmutallab, the engineering
graduate accused of trying to blow
up almost 300 passengers on a trans-
atlantic flight on Christmas Day, in-
vestigations have shown that this ter-
rorist ‘’pipeline’’ to Somalia suggests
Britain may have become a breeding
ground for Al-Qaeda.
Al-Shabaab, Arabic for ‘’the youth’’,
is engaged in a violent struggle against
Somalia’s western backed government.
Experts consider it an African fran-
chise of Al-Qaeda, and religious leader
Sheikh Mohamed Ahmed warns that
Al-Shabaab is exploiting a loophole
in order to recruit students from Lon-
don. Although many of them were
born in Somalia, they are British citi-
zens and have grown up in the UK.
‘’It’s unbelievable’’, Ahmed remarked,
‘’the group’s supporters and recruiters
are free to do what they want.’’

Babar Ahmed, a College IT employee
was arrested for a second time due to
suspicious material on his computer.
He has yet to be charged and is now
fighting extradition to the US.
King’s College, LSE and Imperial said
they had no record of the mentioned
students, but Britain’s Somali commu-
nity use a variety of names to refer to
them.

Babar Ahmad, a former employee of
Imperial College, was first arrested
under anit-terror laws in December
2003. He was released without charge
but arrested again in August 2004 and
charged in a US court two months
later.
Babar allegedly used US-based
websites to recruit fighters for causes
in Afghanistan and Chechnya. He was
also charged with maintaining e-mail
contact with a Chechen rebel leader.
He remains under arrest due to an ex-
tradition warrant from the U.S.
Babar is a former Imperial College
student staff member in the IT depart-
ment and has remained in custody
since 2004, without trial. To this day
he is the longest detained-without-
trial British citizen held as part of the
‘war on terror’.
ICU passed policy in 2004 fully sup-
porting Babar Ahmad and his fight
against extradition and maintain their
stance that he is entitled to a fair trial.
