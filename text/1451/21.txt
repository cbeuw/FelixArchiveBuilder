away from this level of club promo-
tion and concentrated on selling mu-
sic around the world and in that time
also the licensing laws changed and
clubs compete with bars; things have
gotten more thinly spread over town.
I think it was great that the clubs were
packed. You couldnt book a venue in
Brighton on a weekend night as clubs
were so popular, and now you can eas-
ily go and get a club for a birthday par-
ty. Back then it meant people had to
work hard to deliver something spe-
cial and parties were bigger. But I am
not one to dwell on how things used
to be, as I am as excited about our mu-
sic and nights as I ever was. Brighton
is an ever-changing and developing
music town and that remains strong.
When the label was smaller you
must have been choosing your art-
ists personally, has that changed?
When we started we did tended
to sign people based in Brighton, or
friends of people down here, so that
meant Nostalgia 77, Natural Self,
Quantic, Bonobo etc. Nowadays
we get sent demos from all over the
world. But in a way our scene (which
doesnt really have a name) has a net-
work across the world. So we are
friends with the labels who do our
music all over the world and so it feels
like the same family in Brighton, but
in a larger sense.
Considering your releases range
from electronica and drum & bass
to soul & funk, what is the unifying
thread between all the artists you
have signed?
Rob picks the acts based on some-
thing that he likes in their specific ear
for a tune. So when we signed Flevans
the first time around he was doing
music on a 4 track, but Rob liked his
quirky sounds and how he put them
together. Flevans thought it was a
mate pretending to be Rob, when Rob
called him. Rob has never told me this,
but Flevans mentioned that he thinks
he told him in colourful language to
um, go away. But all of our acts have
a certain individual sound and that is
what we are drawn to.
In which musical directions are you
looking to expand the label?
Last year was our 10th birth-
day year and it was enjoyable
doing the parties and our spe-
cial 3 disc booklet. But we
also sat at the end of the year
and decided that we wanted
to take the label back to its
route of more future look-
ing music. This year we have
signed Maddslinky aka Zed
Bias, who is collaborating with
and getting mixes from people
like Toddla T, MJ Cole, Omar,
Skream, Mr Scruff, Blame and
AtJazz, which is an exciting
project with all these quality
artists from a range of gen-
res. We have also got a double
compilation album form Zero
dB (Ninja Tune) and then add

Founded in 1999 by Paul Jonas and Robert Luis, Tru Thoughts independent record label has been managing leading
jazz, funk, soul and hip hop artists for the past ten years. Kadhim Shubber gets in a word with Paul Jonas
Ten years of independence: Tru Thoughts
W
hat were your
aims when you
founded Tru
Thoughts? What
was the label’s
raison d’etre?
We started the label in 1999 from
Rob Luis’ stairwell and the reason for
starting the label was that we were
running a weekly club night (called
phonic:hoop) and we noticed promot-
ers were coming in and pinching our
acts, so we thought that if we released
their music then we would create a
roster of acts for both club and label.
Musically we wanted to release soul,
jazz and funk, but in its more contem-
porary terms.
Has it changed at all over the last
ten years?
I think our love of music and our
dreams of running a label have re-
mained, and the people we work with
on the label, in the office and day to
day follow that same philosophy. Mu-
sically it has been an enjoyable jour-
ney. We have always supported our
key producers on the journeys they
have taken. So Nostalgia 77 went
from hip hop, funky 7s to winning the
John Peel Play More Jazz Award with
his jazz releases, Quantic went from
bedroom producer to fronting a funk
band (Quantic Soul Orchestra) and
then moving to Colombia and making
music with artists from South Amer-
ica (Quantic and his Combo Barbaro)
and Lance from The Bamboos has
done music as The Bamboos (funk
and soul), Lanu (broken beat and
dance music) and introduced us to
Kylie Auldist (soul, jazz, funk singer).
All of these journeys have happened
organically and we have been involved
all the way. We may not have planned
all the stages, but we have enjoyed
where they have gone and have sup-
ported them.
When you were running it from un-
derneath Rob Luis’ stairs, did you
think that you’d reach your tenth
anniversary?
Ha ha, no chance! I was running
around trying to not get caught
putting posters in illegal places and
Rob was mostly buying and develop-
ing his huge record collection.
How did the label fit in with the
music scene in Brighton around the
millennium? Do you think nowa-
days that the Brighton music scene
is assumed to just involve skinny
jeaned indie pop?
When we started the label, the town
was popular for the style of ourselves,
Skint and Catskills Records. Trip hop,
nu jazz, big beat, whatever the names
were, it was a stage where people
were sampling, looping, cutting up
and mixing styles. Very hip hop in its
base, but with a world of influences.
Our weekly night (and our Mr Scruff
monthly night) pulled in around 2000
people a month, so there were some
amazing parties. We have changed
things around over the years, moved

Flowering Inferno project.
If you could sign anyone, who would
you take on?
We have had the pleasure of work-
ing with a lot of the people we wanted
to. There have been one or two acts
in ten years that we have tried to sign
and lost, but it is a pretty small per-
centage thankfully. We were sad to see
Alice Russell leave the label, but this
can happen when acts want to try a
different route to selling music. It is
complicated to explain, but people
have different ways of looking to sell
music and we have a certain model
that has worked well for us and at-
tracts some acts, but with Alice she
wanted a different form. We hope
she will record for us in some form
again soon. In terms of others, well
we would want to get some massive
acts of course! I dont know maybe the
Quantic/Stevie Wonder album is what
we should aim at!
How did the Unfold/Tru Thoughts
Covers album come about? Was that
your idea or the artists?
When the Quantic Soul Orchestra
album was being put together Quantic
and ourselves felt that the retro cover
version was an overdone thing, and
so Will (Quantic) did versions of Mr
Scruff, Sunshine Anderson and 4Hero.
That theme has stayed throughout the
label with Nostalgia 77 and Alice do-
ing Seven Nation Army, The Bamboos
doing Max Sedgley’s Happy etc… and
we got asked a lot to put them all on an
album. We felt conscious of the whole
Mark Ronson thing, but wanted to put
them out anyway as we have ten years
of them. It is a great album. Really
handy for party DJing!
Tell us about Zebra Traffic. How did
that get started?
We always wanted hip hop to be
a part of our releases. We felt that it
needed its own label (and hip hop
buyers are a bit unforgiving if you mix
genres!) but one of the key things was
the potential of releasing music by Phi
Life Cypher and Life, who remain one
of the best crews the UK
has seen.
Are there any plans for
an album of hip hop
covers by Tru Thoughts
artists? We thought that
Hot 8 Brass Band would
sound good covering
Snoop Dogg and maybe
Alice Russell covering
Wu Tang Clan. What do
you think?
Nice idea! I might pinch
that, Thanks!!! Alice do-
ing Wu Tang would be
classic.
Tru Thoughts has pros-
pered in a time when
independent labels and
recordshops also have been in de-
cline. What has Tru Thoughts done
differently?
This comes down to where I men-
tioned the way that we run the label.
We started with little money so we
had to do everything ourselves, and
this kind of stuck over the years. We
are careful with money and let the mu-
sic do the talking. If a country loves a
certain album then we put money in
to support that and so on and so forth.
Some feel this is us being too cautious,
but we have unfortunately seen so
many of our favourite labels go down
because they took big risks. We want
to be around for the next 30 years and
onwards.
Increasingly, records are being re-
leased through vinyl and mp3 only,
do you think that combination is the
future?
The business is ever changing. Vi-
nyl was dead a few years ago and now
people are saying it is becoming more
popular (it is growing in the States for
instance). We keep an eye on changes
and consider each release on what we
think will work. We still sell a good

number of CDs worldwide and the al-
bum format does tend to be central to
our ways of working music.
How do you think the music in-
dustry will overcome the problem
of music piracy? Or continue to be
profitable in a world where people
download music for free?
It won’t be able to overcome it I
think, it is a rare business where the
thing it sells – the CD – can be easily
given out between people for free in
the same quality. That will remain. For
us we hope that enough people don’t
want to do that. I buy music when I
want to get something as I want the
artist to get paid and make more
money. This attitude is shared by a lot
of people I feel. Maybe we won’t sell
a million cds but we might just sell
100,000 and we can make a living and
release more music for that.
Do you have any tips for musicians
who want to copy Tru Thoughts
model of starting a label to release
their own material? Or for anyone
brave enough to go about starting
their own label?
I think it is all about promoting
the music. The worst thing people
do when they start a club night for
instance is think that they can put a
small advert in one mag and then their
club will be full. You have to poster, ad-
vertise, do online promo, tell everyone
you have ever met and go into every
shop in Brighton and invite them. The
same is the case for a label. The music
bit is the simple bit. You then have to
work hard. Don’t be put off though.
It is a a great job to have. But maybe
don’t expect to make a huge living!
