The Union’s policy is to oppose a rise in tuition
fees. When you’re representing the Union
externally what do you say when someone asks
‘howarewegoingfundeducationwithoutraising
tuition fees?’
That’s never come up actually! So far, no one has
actuallycomeupwithanalternativemodel.Ifyou
look at the NUS model, that involves graduate
tax, which we’re opposed to, because our policy
also opposes it. My problem with this question is
that I can only say what the Union’s policy is and
we don’t have a policy on this. We’re working
quitecloselywiththeothernon-NUSuniversities
to bring about an alternative model for funding.
There’s going to be a survey of students this
term which will help form a policy on this so
hopefully next time I’m asked that question I
can say our policy has an alternative model.
Tuition Fees
Accommodation
Are you worried that the price of accommodation
at Imperial excludes students?
My main worry with accommodation prices is
that you end up with a sort of class system with
halls.You’vegotthereallyrichpeopleinpremium
rooms and less well off people in triple sharing
rooms in crappy halls. There is an idea with
some people at college that Imperial shouldn’t
do anything second-rate, so all accommodation
should be of a very high standard. Which is
great, if they’re affordable, which they won’t be.
My argument is that to ensure that everybody
can afford to be at university, then you have to
provide a range, which includes lower quality,
affordable, accommodation. There won’t be any
more re-development for quite some time after
Eastside and Southside so for now we can keep
thebalancethatwehaveatpresent.Imean,when
people can afford to pay £37,000 a year in fees
then you might say that you can afford an extra
£150 a week for accommodation, but if you’re
paying those fees and over-stretching yourself
thenyouneedcheapaffordableaccommodation.
that happened?
A - The problem with table service is
that people move around and then the
bar-staff waste loads of time looking
for them, and then your food gets cold.
On busy nights we can’t spare the staff
to do table service. We’re discussing,
with the re-development, to introduce
hand held buzzers which will tell you
when you can collect your food.
K - Why isn’t it coming in this year?
A - I didn’t expect the refurbishment
to happen this year, we were told that
we wouldn’t get any money from the
College, but we put together a good
business plan and reduced the scope
of what we’re doing to the point where
we can afford it. So now it makes more
sense for a lot of the stuff that I wanted
to do this year to be included with the
refurbishment.
K - Another thing that you promised
in your manifesto was to have “secret
shoppers” to report on the quality of
service in the Union. Is that happening?
A - It’s starting this term. I haven’t se-
lected the secret shoppers yet. Basically
you’d go to the Union, get a meal, fill
in a form about it and we’d refund you
so you get a free meal. Anyone who’s
interested, give me an email. We actu-
ally did it over the summer, with the
barbecue that we had outside and we
identified some problems which were
fixed. I wanted to start it straight away
at the beginning of term but I found
that there was no need because even
as President at times I was getting poor
service. We’ve got to the point where I
think the service standards have come
up, so now maybe I’m too close to it and
so hopefully the secret shoppers will
help to iron out any problems that I’m
unaware of.
Bar service
K - In terms of motivating student staff,
what can you actually do to, say, speed
up bar service?
A - What I want to do is hold on to ex-
perienced bar staff, which you can only
do by offering them money. We’re try-
ing to put in a training program. What
the Union does quite badly is that we
throw people in at the deep end and
then people complain that they can’t
pour a pint properly, well what can we
expect when we don’t train them prop-
erly. That said, we do have some excel-
lent bar-staff who could be part of that
training process.
K - When is that going to come into
action?
A - We’re trying to get an intern from
College because we don’t have the staff
resources to do it ourselves. If that hap-
pens, then we’ll have someone starting
in March to build this training package
for about six months. There is training
at the bars already, which needs re-
finement also. The problem is that we
didn’t do this in October so we didn’t
train all the new staff as we would have
liked. So it’s behind where it should be.
We also want to review pay-scales so
that student staff that progress through
the training and stay on longer will see
an increase in their wages.
K - At the moment, the bar-staff get
paid near enough minimum wage. Do
you think that acts as a disincentive to
really care about the job?
A - Yes. But it’s not as simple as that,
because we have to structure it to be
fair. It’s great to give people extra pay
if they’re experienced, but how do you
define if they’re experienced? There’s
the basic pay when you first start and
that wouldn’t go up because there’s
quite a high turnover, and you don’t
want to invest resources if staff aren’t
going to stick around. Hopefully this
will start coming in around March.
K - The price of drinks usually increas-
es every couple of years, is this going to
happen next year?
A - It will go up this summer, probably
by about 10p. We managed to avoid
putting the prices up last summer be-
cause we had a deal with a new sup-
plier, but as result of that it has to go
up this summer. Obviously there’s an-
other issue with the wider crackdown
on cheap drinks. If the government
decides to introduce minimum drinks
pricing then our prices could go up, but
then prices could go up everywhere.
K - In your manifesto you promised
to do more deals on spirits. But that
hasn’t happened.
A - Nope. We did some deals at the
beginning of the year, but part of the
problem is that alcohol license holders
are being told, in no uncertain terms,
not to encourage excessive drinking.
If we introduce, for example “double
up for 10p”, as a new promotion, then
there’d be issues with the licensing
people. I would like to see some deals
on spirits, but squaring it with licens-
ing authorities is a problem.
Drinks prices
K - Do you think that students should
care about what goes on at the Union?
A - It depends on what’s going on. For
example, there’s a motion coming to
Council this month asking for a refer-
endum on a smoke-free campus. Now
if students think that’s a good idea, or
a bad idea, then they should come and
have their views heard. If people want
things changed, then they should come
to Council.
K - Will a smoking ban have a positive
impact at imperial?
A - It will definitely cause problems in
some areas. For example, if you’re in
the bar, you’ll have to go all the way out
to Prince Consort Road, which is quite
inconvenient.
K - Do you agree with the principle of
a smoking ban?
A - Students are adults and if they
want to smoke, that’s their choice. I’d
be in favour of more rigorous controls
to stop people smoking by doors, but
not a complete ban. Of course, policing
that sort of thing is a right pain.
Smoking ban
K - The RCSU and CGCU Autumn
Balls attracted a lot of controversy last
term. Did they spend too much money
on their events?
A - They lost money, so you’d say yes
they spent too much money, but it’s
not as black and white as that. The FUs
have two main roles. One is welfare for
their students, which is the most im-
portant thing that they should be do-
ing and they should be spending time
on that. If you get people involved and
comfortable about talking to the FU by
throwing parties, then great. The oth-
er role is to foster a community spirit
with the FU, which is the reason for the
parties, but I’m not sure that you want
to be spending extortionate amounts
of money on that sort of stuff.
K - The CGCU President last term,
Kirsty Patterson, responded to criticism
about the amount of money spent on
the CGCU’s Masquerade Ball by refer-
encing Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’. Do
you think that was an appropriate way
to explain to engineering students why
money was spent in the way that it was?
A - No, basically. I’m fairly laid back
and if people think that I’ve screwed
something up, I should talk to them and
explain why things have or haven’t been
done, which is why I’m doing this inter-
view. I think that you have to do that be-
cause people have voted for you.
K - Also, the CGCU’s Welfare Officer,
Alice Rowlands criticised the amount
of support that you provided to the
CGCU in an article in felix. Do you feel
that her criticism was fair?
A - The problem with the CGCU was
that nothing was written down. I told
them that we’ll support it and we’ll
find an act for it. The Union Entertain-
ment team offered them a number of
acts that they could choose and they
went for an expensive one. That’s their
choice. Our role was not, and was
never going to be, to run their event
for them and give them the profit. The
situation was that we’d support them
in their event and on the Friday before
I was with the President of Guilds get-
ting things prepared for the Ball. The
support was there, they just had to ask
for it, not just sitting there and whinge-
ing. They should have come and said
‘this is going wrong, what can you do?’
K - Regarding the Freshers Festival,
Dan Fowler, the organiser said they
didn’t get enough Union support either.
A - That was our fault like I talked
about before, and they did get less sup-
port than Guilds did. But we learned
a lot from that and I wouldn’t say the
Guilds didn’t receive enough sup-
port. When I asked them to really lay
out what they expected from us, and
what we didn’t give them, they didn’t
respond. I can’t do anything about that
if they’re not going to tell me what they
expected.
K - What is your main aim for the rest
of your time as President?
A - Getting the re-development done
properly. Even if I do nothing else, I
want to make sure that we get that
Faculty crisis
right, because we don’t get the oppor-
tunity to spend that kind of money very
often.
K - The elections for next years sabbati-
cal will be starting soon. What do you
think next year’s President should be
focused on?
A - There are probably two things, first-
ly pushing Phase 3 of the re-develop-
ment through smoothly. But also mak-
ing students aware of the representation
network and the changes that have been
put in place. Students fill out surveys
and then wonder what’s been done but
for example, we have a new Dean of
Teaching and Learning to deal with stu-
dent’s issues. The university created a
whole new position specifically for that
and the challenge I think is to ensure
that students know about and are able
to take advantage of these changes.
The
smoking
ban refer-
endum will
be debated
at Council
on the 15th
of Febru-
ary in the
Union Din-
ing Hall at
6:30pm
“It takes a
long time to get
into the role. If
I could go back
to September
knowing what
I know now,
then I would
get a lot more
done. There’s
a lot of stuff
that you don’t
necessarily
imagine as
taking up a lot
of your time
but you get into
the job and you
ask yourself
“Where’s all my
time gone?”
