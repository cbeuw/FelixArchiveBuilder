France to ban the
wearing of the niqab

France, a country known mainly for
cheese, wine, surrendering, gourmet
food and the Eiffel Tower, is not a
country I often praise. There is, how-
ever, one thing which I envy about
France: the way the French Republic
sticks to its principles – mostly.
This week, a French parliamentary
committee published its report recom-
mending a ban on wearing veils which
cover the face in public places. This
is the latest episode in a movement
within France to stop the wearing of
the niqab, which the French press
and government is belligerently, and
wrongly, calling the burqa. The niqab
is a full body veil with slits for the eyes.
The burqa, a full body-and-face cover-
ing garment with a mesh allowing the
wearer to see, is from Afghanistan and
all but unseen in France.
Last year, President Sarkozy made
the first presidential address to par-
liament in 136 years. The speech was
broad and wide-ranging, and until that
year had been banned to protect the
separation of powers in France. This
alone sparked controversy, especially
as it was held at the Palace of Versailles
leading some to perceive connotations
of monarchy and a thirst for increased
presidential power. However, the real
controversy was not the move towards
a king-like president, such as the posi-
tion has become in America, but from
a few remarks that Sarkozy made.
In his address, he stated that “[the
burqa] will not be welcome on French
soil... We cannot accept, in our coun-
try, women imprisoned behind a
mesh, cut off from society, deprived of
all identity. That is not the French re-
public’s idea of women’s dignity.”
Since then, the wheels have been set
in motion in this further progression
towards a secular nation. Secularism,
or ‘laïcité’ as the concept is known
in France, is part not just of the cul-
ture, but part of the constitution.
Wearing ‘conspicuous’ religious
symbols was banned in schools in
2004. It follows then that France
should forbid the wearing of
such a prominent religious sym-
bol as the niqab. What is inter-
esting, though, is that many of
the arguments for forbidding
the burqa revolve around se-
curity concerns and the diffi-
culties in cultural integration
of someone who cannot be
seen, rather than in further
removal of religion from
the state. People press-
ing for the ban com-
monly point out, just as
Sarkozy has, “The burqa
is not a religious sign”
and that “neither the
burqa, nor the niqab,”
as Dalil Boubakeur,
rector of the Paris
Mosque says “nor
any all-over veil, are
religious prescrip-
tions of Islam.”
France is currently home to over 5
million Muslims, the largest Islamic
population of any European nation,
most of whom are ethnically descend-
ed from North Africa where Muslim
women don’t typically wear veils that
fully cover the face. Reports suggest
there are approximately 1900 women
who currently wear the niqab or burqa
in France. Sources claim that 90% who
do are under 40, 2/3 are French na-
tionals and nearly ¼ are converts. This
means that the vast majority of those
wearing the full veil are women whose
mothers did/do not wear the full veil,
from which it has been concluded that
the increase in women wearing the
veil in France is not from immigration
of people from the Gulf, but from the
growth of ultra-puritan Islam amongst
the population.
Whether the ban will actually mate-
rialise is another matter. The expected
course is for the report to be followed
by the drafting of a bill and a debate in
parliament. The main opposition party
has stated it is against the ban, and the
far-right movement led by Jean-Marie
Le Pen has said a ban is unnecessary as
French law already prohibits being out
in public with a mask on.
five men at the centre of the case have
been living off £10 a week in cash and
require special permission for other
expenses. The judgement has been
suspended for a month by the court,
allowing the government to change
the law to lawfully freeze alleged ter-
rorist assets. The two orders to freeze
assets were brought in by Gordon
Brown when he was Chancellor of the
Exchequer.
In the ruling, the Supreme Court jus-
tices said that if the government want-
ed to take “far-reaching measures” to
combat terrorism, then approval from
Parliament is needed. Lord Hope said:
“Even in the face of the threat of in-
ternational terrorism, the safety of
the people is not the supreme law. We
must be just as careful to guard against
unrestrained encroachments on per-
sonal liberty”. He continued that the
Treasury had exceeded its powers in
how it had devised and implemented
the Terrorism Order. “This is a clear
example of an attempt to adversely af-
fect the basic rights of the citizen with-
out the clear authority of Parliament,”
he said.
Lord Hope said that one of the five
men, Mohammed al-Ghabra, had been
denied a basic right to challenge his
restrictions.
In the explanation of the judge-
ment, Lord Phillips, president of the
Supreme Court, said: “Nobody should
conclude that the result of these ap-
peals constitutes judicial interference
with the will of Parliament. On the
contrary, it upholds the supremacy of
Parliament in deciding whether or not
measures should be imposed that af-
fect the fundamental rights of those in
this country.”
A spokesman for the Treasury said
that it would attempt a change of leg-
islation as soon as possible but would
abide by the ruling.
“It’s important to be clear that this
ruling does not challenge the UK’s
“This is an attempt
to adversely affect
the rights of the
citizen without
the authority of
Parliament”
obligations under the UN Charter to
freeze the assets of suspected terror-
ists, which we will continue to meet.
We will introduce fast-track legislation
to ensure there is no disruption to our
terrorist asset-freezing powers.”
