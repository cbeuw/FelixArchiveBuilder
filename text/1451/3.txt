Guilds Vice President AWOL? Not likely, he says
In a long line of mishaps involving the
City & Guilds College Union, their
Vice President (Finance & Societies)
Rikki Norris has been criticised for his
absence about College, but has now
spoken to felix to clarify the situation.
On 21st January, the CGCU’s news
website Live! reported that Jenny Wil-
son had to take up some the slack cre-
ated by Norris’s absence by process-
ing nearly £2,000 worth of claims. Mr.
Norris has since said he has been ill for
an “extended period of time”, and feels
that the Live! article is largely unfair to
him in light of his illness.
His disappearance has been largely
condemned by the news website and
its readers leaving comments on the
article, even citing comments from
Union officers such as Deputy Presi-
dent (Welfare) John James. It read
‘John James explained to Live! that he
was awaiting a claim of £200 for items
he bought on behalf of a Guilds Club at
the beginning of December.’
He was reported to be ‘absent without
leave’
, and many members of the Union
and CGCU unaware of the wherea-
bouts. However, Mr. Norris says that
he had made contact to explain himself
and this matter took some time to tran-
scend through the offices.
“Some of the Union officers were
aware that I had been ill, but I don’t
think that they were aware of the ex-
tent of my situation until it became
apparent that I had been absent for an
extended period of time. As such, the
message would not have been passed
down to CGCU until the higher ech-
elons of the Union had realised what
Ultimate Imperial storming
through Field Trip
Last Friday Imperial College Union’s
own television station relaunched itself
with the airing of the first live broad-
cast of the year. STOIC (Student Tele-
vision of Imperial College) transmitted
live the first episode of their new flag-
ship magazine programme ‘The Big
Show’ directly to the JCR and on-line.
Featured on the show was a tour of the
Queen’s Tower, a live scientific experi-
ment in the Beit Quad and an exclusive
interview with Carol Vorderman, all
presented and filmed by members of
the society.
STOIC has fell on hard times in re-
cent years with a select group of hard-
core members keeping the society go-
ing, and it is hoped the relaunch will
get more people interested in making
content and getting involved. “It’s tak-
en us a term to get to this stage,” says
Dominic Rees-Roberts, executive pro-
ducer of The Big Show, “but the station
is open for business.”
However, the first broadcast did not
go off without problems. At the sched-
uled start time of 1pm, viewers were
greeted with a colourful placeholder
and informed that the station was ex-
periencing ‘technical difficulties’. The
wait continued for almost an hour un-
til the show was ready to air, and by the
time the program began many viewers
had left the JCR to get back to work.
While investigating the cause of the
issue, felix was told “the great thing
is we’ve got forty years of history, but
some of our equipment is forty years
old too. Though that is part of the fun
of it, on Friday we were particularly
tested.”
When asked about what the future
holds for STOIC, Dominic men-
tions that the relaunch continues
with other events. STOIC is run-
ning a film competition, challenging
students to make a film in a week
using a prop, character and line of
dialog set by the judges. All films
will be shown in collaboration with
FilmSoc and there is a prize for the
winning entry. Ciné Division is an-
was going on.”
Live! also reported on the amount
of outstanding claims that Mr. Norris
hadn’t been able to process, claiming to

other new direction giving students
the chance to shoot on Super8 film,
a format used by many professionals
today.
Work has already started on the
next episode of ‘The Big Show’, and
the society is looking for interested
students to help out. “What we need
are people who have got ideas for
the next show or want to film with
us. We’re looking for students who
can be committed, but most impor-
tantly want to have fun doing it.”

Five teams of Imperial students who
entered BP’s Ultimate Field Trip com-
petition are through to the semi finals,
in which they will compete by present-
ing their ideas on tackling the carbon
challenge to a panel of BP experts. The
fifteen students are competing for the
opportunity to receive a paid intern-
ship with BP in their North Sea busi-
ness unit this summer.
The five teams were selected from
fifty two entries after grabbing the at-
tention of the judges with their initial
five minute pitches. The expert panel,
formed of some of BP’s leading scien-
tists and CCS experts, were especially
satisfied with the ideas presented and
the concepts proposed.
The teams are: SINCE, formed of
Chia Wei Hong James, Aw Seng Sean
and Yuen Yu Leng, who are first years
studying Chemical Engineering; Melt-
down, consisting of Lizzie Riley, Chris
Hunter and Ben Said, who are second
years, studying an MSc in Geology; IC
Engineers, made up of first year Chem-
ical Engineers Eugenia Ho, Eileen
Brandley and Yan Isis Xie; Hot Carbon,
with second years Tom Wesby, (MSc in
Geology & Geophysics), Carmen Pin-
to-Ward and Miriam Wright (MSc in
Geology); and West 3, formed by first
years Patrick Delaney studying Geolo-
gy & Geophysics, Lee Shyen Lee study-
ing Chemical Engineering and Mikaela
Bryant-Meisner studying Physics.
The students will have to compete
against teams from the University of
Cambridge, Durham, University of Ab-
erdeen, Robert Gordon University, Uni-
versity of Oxford, University of Notting-
ham and the University of Manchester.
The Imperial teams will present their
ideas in February at the semi finals,
where up to six teams will enter the final
on April 12th at the Natural History Mu-
seum, hosted by BBC broadcaster, John
Humphreys. Progress can be followed
online via the #BPFieldTrip Twitter.

have ‘found them [claim forms] piling
up in the CGCU pigeonhole in Student

. Mr. Norris admitted
he needed some assistance in this mat-
ter, but has himself been playing catch-
up after returning the College.
“The DPCS, Jenny Wilson, very
kindly carried out a cheque run in my
absence to try and reduce the strain on
Guilds clubs.
“By the time this has gone to print,
I have also carried out a cheque run
which should have cleared out all valid
outstanding claims.”
Mr. Norris took the opportunity to
talk to felix to admit he was “rather
disappointed” with the Live! website
when “no indication of
sympathy” was given to-
wards his situation, de-
spite immediate contact
and a full explanation.
“Upon seeing the article
I immediately contacted
the editor to request that
he temporarily took the arti-
cle down, and that upon my return I
would happily go through the issues he
had raised in order to present a more
accurate interpretation of what had
been happening to the clubs in CGCU,
rather than mere speculation.
After Live! Editor Lawrence Weet-
man refused to take down or alter the
article, stating that the article was “fac-
tually accurate.” Mr. Norris found his
reluctance to update the article “some-
what unnerving.”
Mr. Weetman was unrepentant about
his actions claiming “Rikki [Norris] is
more than capable of coming to Live!
and posting a comment. If he believes
that anything in the article is unfair or
untrue then he may, as always, follow
the correct complaints procedure or
email the editor.”
Mr. Norris has since decided to speak
to felix and issue a formal statement. He
stated that he is now around College.
“I’m around again, not in full capaci-
ty, but I’m around and will be operating
as Vice President (Finance & Societies)
for the CGCU once again. I’ve been in
contact with those affected. Normal
service will resume shortly.”
