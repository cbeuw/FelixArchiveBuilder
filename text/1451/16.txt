The Road
A Prophet is the latest masterpiece that
has emerged from France. The story
focuses on Malik El Djebena, a 19 year
old Arabic man who is given a 6 year
sentence in a corrupted French jail. He
enters the prison with no family, no
religion, and no friends. His only dis-
tinctive previous home was a Juvenile
hall, and is now left alone in a cruel
new world.
With a six year stretch ahead of him,
Malik is clearly vulnerable within the
prison walls. At first, the naïve Malik
has every intention of keeping his head
down in the prison where he is notice-
ably out of his depth. Unfortunately
the prison has other plans for him.
He is approached by a group of Cor-
sican inmates, who control everything
that happens within the prison. In ex-
change for their protection, he must
complete a series of tasks for them and
soon becomes caught in the criminal
cobweb that fills the prison.
He is first told to kill an enemy in-

mate or be killed. Upon accepting the
mission, he is told he must hide a razor
blade in his mouth to be allowed access
into the inmate’s cell where he can take
the victim’s life. He must initially over-
come his conscience before he can kill
a stranger. The scene is gut twistingly
intense yet vividly real.
Malik is played by Tahar Rahim, who
was relatively unknown before the film,
but has shot into the limelight with a
fantastic debut. Rahim produces a gritty
performance, evolving brilliantly from
timid teenager to criminal mastermind.
During Malik’s stay, the prison’s
demographics change, to which he
takes full advantage. He slowly gains
the trust of Corsican kingpin César,
whilst involving himself within a group
of Arabic prisoners, who aim to take
control of the prison. Battling between
the politics of prison life and his own
survival, Malik mercilessly attempts to
climb the criminal ladder in and out of
the prison. The film constructs a bril-
liant insight into life within a prison,
and makes anything conjured up in
films like The Shawshank Redemption
look like a weekend stay at a Holiday
Inn. The brutal dog-eat-dog world
never forgives or takes a break.
Kingpin César is played superbly by
Niels Arestrup. The cold hearted man
slowly deteriorates to desperation as
the world that he previously ruled
crumbles around him. César’s evident
weakness becomes Malik’s strength in
his path to glory. Malik is reborn with-
in the prison where he experiences
a new type of paradoxical independ-
ence which he could not experience
in the outside world. The film is made
with near perfect execution. Director
Jacques Audiard produces a claustro-
phobic view of prison life, whilst main-
taining a gripping portrayal of Malik’s
rise in the prison hierarchy. Jacques
Audiard won the 2005 Best Direc-
tor award for The Beat that my Heart
The cause of the mass destruction is
never explained and the audience is
never encouraged to care. The point
is everything has died. No plants or
animals have existed for the past few
years. It’s only the humans who have
survived, and since all we make is
trouble, this sets the perfect apoca-
lyptic scene. An unnamed man (Viggo
Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-
McPhee) struggle on, heading south,
hoping it will be warmer and more
habitable. Their journey is never easy
since man has turned against each oth-
er, resorting to theft, murder, rape and
cannibalism. The naïve son, who still
has his youth and innocence intact,
is desperate for them to be “the good
guys.” And the father doesn’t have the
heart to tell him that not everything
works that way. But of course, when
society has been damaged to such an
extent, survival involves getting your
hands dirty, an idea never fully grasped
by the boy who was born during the
most unfortunate times.
Smit-McPhee is convincing in his
purest, boyish form, shocked and hor-
rified at every dishonesty and moral
corruption from his surroundings.
Mortensen gives a truly moving per-
formance as the father who will do lit-
erally anything to protect his son; he’s
even prepared to shoot the boy himself
to spare him the misery and pain of be-
ing captured by a hungry band of can-
nibals. The relationship between the
two is never over-done. The boy is by
no means too vulnerable to be cute,
and the man is not portrayed as the
omnipotent superhero who is capable
of saving his son time after time. There
is a raw, genuine connection between
the father and son who aren’t perfect.
As the film progresses the conflict of
ideals between the two becomes more
apparent. The man is prepared to steal
and kill for survival whereas through
the eyes of the boy, one should never
do such things no matter what the
circumstances.
A couple of equally talented actors
play minor roles. Charlize Theron
plays the wife in flashbacks and Rob-
ert Duvall plays an old man who is also
wandering aimlessly. They have very
little screen-time and although it’s easy
to think that their acting abilities were
under used, The Road reminds us that
this is strictly a film about Mortensen
and Smit-McPhee and doesn’t deviate
away from that.
The scenery couldn’t be more de-
pressing. Dead trees and crops line
the pathway and there isn’t even an
inch of greenery in sight which is the
truly terrifying nature of the film. The
bare, grey emptiness constantly re-
minds us of death and destruction
all-round. Even when we do see
humans, it’s never a welcoming
sight, since they’re most likely
to be violent gangs of cannibals
who will stop at nothing to eat
a bit of flesh.
The Road is a truly heart-felt
portrayal of love, pain and hu-
man values during the chilling
days of a devastating apocalypse.
The brutal reality of human nature
is never easy to stomach, but what
the film shows is the ugly, inconven-
Skipped, a Parisian criminal thriller

will be undoubtedly a commanding
contender for this year’s prize and is
certainly a name to look out for in the
future. A Prophet won Best film award
at BFI London film festival and Grand
Prix at the Cannes film festival, and it’s
clearly visible why. This powerhouse
production contains a potent formula
for a fierce prison thriller that’s defi-
nitely worth seeing.
