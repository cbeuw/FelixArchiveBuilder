The Bowie experience
Charming, experimental and British. Eliot
Barford takes a retrospective look at the
re-release of Bowie’s debut album
Who’s afraid
of the big bad
wolf?
I
’m afraid of the big bad wolf,
the wolf in this context, it being
the looming power of the music
industry, in all its underesti-
mated, dream crushing glory. It
is an enormous hive of killer bees that
meddles where it needn’t meddle and
seems to be ever growing. It feeds from
the excitement and enthusiasm of
pretty young things, before devouring
them and leaving the carcasses for mu-
sic journalists such as myself to pick at
until a page in a newspaper is filled. To
say I have no grudge against the music
industry would be a painful lie but, a
first hand account is surely worth more
than rumours.
I once heard an amazing quote by
Elvis Costello which said, “Music jour-
nalism is like dancing about architec-
ture”. This is something that almost
can’t be done, an art in itself because
music is to express what words can’t.
This would be true if the raw musical
material from so many recording art-
ists was left as it was. Instead much
of the music nowadays is subject to
not only months, but years of being
churned through the meat grinder
by the killer bees, leaving it over-
produced and souless. Song writing,
a demo, live performance, rehearsal
and an album are the steps that ought
to be taken that would allow the music
someone makes to naturally develop.
I’m not saying this shouldn’t be a rocky
road with an incredible amount of
work put in, but it shouldn’t be an ex-
ecution of creativity, as it is now.
There is a huge aura of fear that sur-
rounds the ‘top dog’ of a record label,
but in my opinion, fear arises from the
ability for them to do harm to you in
some way, and this is what happens
more often than not. It’s the musicians
with the songs, the look, the influence,
the passion and most importantly the
creativity, everything these people
probably lack. It’s true to say that they
have the power and don’t need you,
but they need new musicians and it
shouldn’t be them to decide who the
musicians they need are.
A friend of mine was signed to a suc-
cessful American record label (they will
remain anonymous to preserve their
dignity), as a drummer in a band and
was set to record in their studios. Be-
fore the studio time, he was informed
by them not to turn up to the sessions
as they were going to employ a session
drummer to record his part, however
his name will appear on the record.
This is the type of music crimes that
are being committed by the big men in
suits, who care not for the music, but
the money, and how to make more of it
by wringing out the wide-eyed, bushy
tailed innovators.
What I want to see, is an album cre-
ated by a handful of people, in one
month without computers. If to you
this seems impossible, come back to
Earth, it’s music not a shuttle launch.
That will be the music that captures a
generation, ‘That’ll be the day’.

Reviews
This is classic HIM, with a touch more
sanity. This single is extremely tight in
all aspects. The sound of crunching
guitars under an American pop-style
vocal, with pauses to accentuate the
lack of dynamics throughout. It feels to
me as if this is HIM on a leash, out for
a Sunday walk, but it can’t be denied
it does call for a night of rock. It must
be said the lyrics lack something when
‘come hither’ is a theme. -Luke Turner
This new single writhes with dirty elec-
tronic sounds laid underneith a hum-
ble choir hum. A well structured song
that catches your ears with heavy lay-
ering and distorted sounds. This is not
breakthrough music, not hugely inter-
esting but it has spirit and a feeling of
fight. A nice follow-on from prievious
music of theirs. - Luke Turner

SINGLE
This is handmade hip-hop in a sim-
ple form with jovial uses of a sampler.
Rapid vocals with laid back break-beat
drums, this has a vintage sound despite
its recent release. A gentle, sweetly
contained album that is just the right
amount of Belleruche, any more may
bring on a repetitive itch, but a talent-
ed group of musical minds.

ALBUM
Bringing back the quirky sounds of
indie guitar, this song is filled with
layered clean guitar riffs. It’s pure in
a dirty way, mainly due to the politely
restrained vocals singing truths of the
human race. This song is pretty guitars
and a pretty vocals with impressive
drumming. - Luke Turner

A jazzy fusion of Ray LaMontagne and
Paulo Nutini, Krystle Warren uses her
beautiful voice in a range of ways to
vary her music. This is feel-good and
laid back to its very definition, ‘Three
Women’ a smile in musical form. Gen-
tle acoustic guitar and crisp clear vo-
cal matched up with an upright bass in
‘Title Track’ speaks soulful music. This
is quite refreshing to hear whilst re-
viewing albums in the felix office dur-
ing sports night at the union, maybe I’d
rather be here when it’s music like this
that’s my subject,and a pint of Guiness.
Beautiful. - Luke Turner

A powerful combination of musical
rebels, amplifiers, and a damaged voice
gives rise to The Smoking Hearts. This
is angry punk rock which despite it’s
clearly audible passion, fails to vary a
huge amount throughout. This loud
five-some are having a ball of a time
playing this music, and metal-lovers
will enjoy this true to the form album.
-Luke Turner
A blur of speed and distorted sounds,
this album is musically intelligent but
true to it’s album name, an abyss. A
deep sounding melancholic mash of
souds that quite often don’t match
well, full of dischord; it is individual
but not my cup of tea. -Luke Turner

S
o David Bowie’s eponymous
debut album is getting the
re-release treatment, with
a Disc 2 filled with A-sides,
B-sides and stuff that didn’t
make it to release. Is it worth your
time? Well, some have put it down as
a misstep better forgotten, but I think
it’s more than that. That’s not to say it
doesn’t have its blemishes though.
As Bowie’s very first LP it should
spark interest in any fan of the man.
Its songs are a mixture of orchestrated
ballads and music hall yarns with a few
somewhere in between. The first, “Un-
cle Arthur”, is a cheesy, innocent, char-
acteristically British tale. The next, my
favourite, is the melancholic “Sell Me a
Coat” and its graceful vocal melodies.
“Love You Till Tuesday” will make you
cringe with its menacing refrain and
reek of “light entertainment”. “There Is
a Happy Land” looks as Bowie’s idea of
childhood idyll. The album progresses
thus, between good pop/rock songs
coming more questionable tracks. Top
of this pile is the B-side “The Laughing
Gnome”, which almost needs no expla-
nation. Terrifyingly, despite its pun on
“London School of Eco-Gnomics”, this
song became a Top 10 hit after Ziggy
Stardust came out!
What about the new stuff? While the
stereo mixes eliminate the mono’s pe-
riod quality, they might enrich the ex-
perience if you ever want to revisit it.
Most of the unreleased material and B-
sides are mediocre, but “The London
Boys” deserves note as a noirish look at
Mod excesses. The BBC sessions large-
ly rehash what is present on the album.
Verdict? I honestly quite like it, but
lots of Bowie devotees will probably
find it embarrassing. I think it’s in-
triguing to see where this “pop genius”
came from, and it’s all there: the sto-
ries, the theatricality, even the dystopi-
an messiah-fantasy (“We Are Hungry
Men”). Above all, David Bowie shows
the man experimenting with existing
tropes to deliver more than just a sonic
experience, and isn’t that what made
him famous when he transformed into
Ziggy Stardust?

The number of O-levels
David Bowie received at
school. It was in Art from
Bromley Technical School.
A song of confusion, uncertainty and
love... The music is certainly not con-
fused and has a bop-along feel. Bring-
ing back memories of The Mystery
Jets; it feels as though this music might
be a few years behind. In all it’s an en-
joyable, docile sound. - Luke Turner
