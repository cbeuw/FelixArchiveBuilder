felix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010
John James, Deputy President (Wel-
fare), presented a controversial paper
to central Union’s Representation and
Welfare Board (RWB) last Thursday,
calling for a ban on smoking on all Un-
ion premises, including Beit Quad. The
paper asks the Union to: Implement a
ban on smoking in any part of Union
premises and a ban on the sale of tobac-
co by the Union and to lobby college to
implement a smoke free campus.
During the meeting, concern was ex-
pressed that a ban on smoking in the
Quad would result in smokers congre-
gating by the entrance on Prince Con-
sort Road or at the back of the Union
building near the Albert Hall. Anyone
entering the Union would still have to
walk past smokers, as would pedestri-
ans using the pavement.
John Silver, Deputy President (Edu-
cation) expressed his dislike of people
smoking in the Quad, implying he felt
unable to ask them not to smoke near
him. He said that he was put off go-
ing into the Quad because he “gets a
face full of smoke” every time he walks
Smoking stubbed out on campus?
through. This reporter wonders wheth-
er Mr Silver’s dislike of walking through
the Quad may go some way to explain
his sporadic attendance at the office.
A lot of people feel a student of Im-
perial College ought to be able to ask
another to alter their behaviour, if they
see it as offensive. As pointed out by
non-smoker, Jess Poore: “If it’s got to
the point where we can no longer rely
on common courtesy and the ability to
ask someone to move away from you
if you find them smoking unpleasant,
and instead need to enforce school-
like rules, we should be concerned
about the general conduct of our stu-
dent population rather than a bit of
smoke.”
Talking to students around campus,
it appears there is little support for a
full ban on smoking in the Quad, even
among non smokers. Amanda Cheung
told felix: “I think a full ban is a bit
extreme but it would be nice if peo-
ple who don’t smoke could sit outside
without having to breathe in cigarette
smoke, especially with the summer
coming. How about implementing
designated smoking in the Quad?”
Smoker Matt Kaufeler joined a
number of students in questioning the
sanity of the motion telling felix: “If
this is anything more than an attempt
to stimulate a debate on smoking, then
it is idiocy. A short term ban would
probably be accompanied by a short
term boycott, which may lead to a long
term loss of custom”
The meeting resolved not to pass
the paper, but to ask Council to vote
on whether to hold a referendum on
whether students want a smoke free
campus at the next Council meeting
on the 15th February. Any student may
attend Council and voice their opin-
ion, though only Council members can
vote on whether to pass a paper.
Aside from soothing the sensitive
nose of our DPE, many question the
motivation of the paper and whether
this is really one of the biggest Welfare
issues affecting Imperial students. If
the aim is to improve the atmosphere
of the Union, the pools of snakebite
and vomit, odour of student and
general decor, should probably be
attended to before smoke in the Quad.
Alternatively, if the aim is to stop
selling students products that may
harm their health, I’m sure the Union
has served me ‘meals’ that pose a far
more imminent danger to my
health than a few
cigarettes would.

T
he five day World Economic Forum has opened its doors in
Davos, Switzerland, where 2500 leaders in business, govern-
ment, and civil services are expected to meet.
Already there has been confrontation between bankers and
regulators. Barclays head Bob Diamond, and Lord Levene,
chairman of the insurance market Lloyd’s, have both lashed out at Barack
Obama’s plans to break up banks ‘too big to fail’. Mr Obama’s proposals, which
need congressional approval, would also prevent banks or financial institu-
tions that own banks from owning hedge funds and bar them from propri-
etary trading. Lord Levene was quoted as saying that “We need good regula-
tion, better regulation but not more regulation.”

n Sri Lanka’s first presidential election since victory in the
civil war against the Tamil Tigers, the incumbent Mahinda
Rajapaksa has been declared winner with a majority of 57.8
percent.
Being the first President to have led a successful campaign against
the Tigers, it may have seemed that Mr. Rajapaksa was in no threat of
losing his post. But his main rival in the race was General Fonseka,
the head of the army during the war, who got 40% of the votes.
Soon after the results were announced by the Electoral Commission,
troops were deployed around the hotel where General Fonseka was
staying. The General has since lodged a complaint to the Electoral
Commission alleging vote rigging.

D
ays of violence between Christians and Muslims in the city
of Jos, Nigeria, have left nearly 500 people dead.
The riots started in Jos, but then spread to neighbouring
towns, and dozens of houses, churches, and mosques have
been burnt down. Police are still removing bodies from wells
and pits, whilst residents are fleeing to military camps set-up around the city.
This is not the first time the city has experienced such trauma. Indeed, an
estimated 200 people were killed in religious clashes in the city in late 2008.
The political situation in Nigeria isn’t helping the situation either. It’s Presi-
dent, Umaru Yar’Adua has been in hospital in Saudi Arabia for two months,
and the Senate has called on him to concede his powers to his deputy, to allow
him to take up presidential duties.

U
nder mounting political pressure, Tim Geithner, U.S.
Treasury secretary, testified on Wednesday for the bailout
of AIG, the world’s largest insurer.
Specifically in question are AIG’s payouts of collateral-
ised debt obligations (CDOs) at full value to undisclosed
counter parties, who were comprised mostly of large banks. As a result,
many politicians and pundits are labelling the bailout a further opaque hand-
out to banks. Geithner defended the bailout of AIG and the measures taken
to uphold its credit rating as “absolutely essential.” This testimony and the
uncertain confirmation of Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke for a second
term come amid a rising wave of populism in the U.S. and elsewhere, affecting
global politics and economic reform.
