thrash medics
in run up to
Varsity
Tom Cotton Rugby
Wednesday afternoon saw ICURFC
2nd XV head to Teddington for an im-
portant encounter with the Medicals,
looking to end a frustrating streak of
close losses in the league and secure a
vital edge before the upcoming Varsity
match.
The beginning of the game saw an
intense period of play, but despite
some promising incursions by College
into the medics 22, characterised by a
strong display from the College back
row of Andy McFadden, Ben Farrell
and Miles Franklin, the score-line re-
mained 0-0.
The deadlock was finally broken and
College were put ahead by tries from
Farrell and Tom, both resulting from
finely executed rolling mauls. How-
ever the medics replied shortly after
as a lack of communication led to a
charge down not far from the Col-
lege line, leaving the medic 9 to run in
unopposed.
The College players recomposed
themselves with the forwards leading
the charge and headed into half-time
confident that the medics were there
for the taking.
The start of the second half saw IC’s
dynamic game-plan finally come to-
gether with the medics being able to
offer little in response. College took
control of the set-piece play as Niall
Watson, Captain Coggy and Fresher
Toby bossed the scrum and Tom Cha-
vas showed some typical Gallic flair
in the line-out. Dave Blake’s one man
mission to take on the medic for-
wards single-handedly saw him justly
rewarded with a hat-trick of tries as
well as providing numerous breaks
supported by Rob Dowden and Fraser
James, allowing College to stretch their
opponents around the park.
In the last 20 minutes, College
stepped up their offensive efforts and
neat handling from Hugh Jarman and
fresher Alex led to Chris Lau scoring
in the corner. Not content with see-
ing their teammates lead the way, the
forwards also went on the attack and
Colin Hill’s try rounded off a powerful
contribution from the sub.
Further contributions from subs Jack
Goring and freshers Rob, Tom and Os-
car led to College completing a mag-
nificent 42-5 victory.
An exhausted yet ecstatic 2nd XV
headed to the bar to reflect over a
memorable win with Hugh Dingle-
berry, recently dropped from the firsts,
entertaining the victors with some
classic anti-medic banter.
David Wilson Sports Editor
Three medal
haul the British
target for
Vancouver
Britain isn’t really into Winter sports.
The names Ed Drake, Elise Christie,
David Murdoch do not have the same
effect as those of Wayne Rooney, Lewis
Hamilton and Jonny Wilkinson. But
those three have, along with 40 other
men and women been chosen to repre-
sent Great Britain at the Winter Olym-
pics held in Vancouver this year.
Britain wouldn’t be your first port
of call if you were looking for world
class winter sports athletes, after all
the country grinds to a halt with a thin
smattering of snow and every year
there is the suggested Christmas break
for the football league. As a nation I
think it is fair to say we don’t like the
cold. We don’t not have the geographi-
cal landscapes (really big mountains)
needed to produce the top athletes for
winter sports and thus the sports are
dominated by men and women from
Austria, France, Switzerland, Germa-
ny, USA and Canada. Therefore these
countries would be expected to domi-
nate the forthcoming games.
However the Brits do try and throw
a spanner in the works when they can
and have managed to pull off some
monumental achievements in the past:
In 2002 at Salt Lake City, Alain Bax-
ter won Britain’s first ever alpine skiing
medal but was subsequently stripped
of it after testing postitive for doping.
Although Baxter still maintains it was
the result of a decongestant. At the
same games four British women won
gold in curling (Bowls but on ice and
with brooms) much to the acclaim of
the British public, although most peo-
ple would be hard pushed to remem-
ber a single name from that team now.
At the last Winter Olympics Shelly
Rudman won an unexpected silver
medal in the skeleton event (jumping
on a tea tray and speeding down an
icey tube) and comes into these games
as a top contender for a medal. Rud-
man’s fiancé, Kristan Bromley, who
also competes in the skeleton event
will be hoping to be among the med-
als after securing the 2008 World
Championship gold medal. In addi-
tion the two (wo)man bobsleigh team
of Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cook
come into the Olympics as 2009 World
Champions as do the men’s curling
team. Cook has become a youtube hit
after her bobsleigh suit split just be-
fore a race revealing her backside to
the television audience. Not a bad way
to raise the profile of your Olympic
quest one could suggest. Minichiello
has only recently returned to racing
after undergoing laser surgery due to
the loss of sight in her left eye, this has
hampered her and Cook’s preparations
for the games somewhat. The funding
body, UK Sport, have set a target of 3
medals for the upcoming games. This
is an optimistic figure but one that is
attainable nonetheless. It is better to
over-achieve than underachieve after
all.
Problems have struck the Britsh
team in the run up to the games how-
ever as the British Ski and Snowboard-
ing Federation are in dire financial dif-
ficulties and many athletes have seen
their funding slashed drastically in
the past year. This has threatened the
participation of some of the athletes
at the Olympics, most notably Chem-
my Alcott. Alcott is perhaps the most
recognisable face of the team going to
Vancouver, she has not set the world of
ski racing alight, and her career could
even be described as disappointing.
However, her looks have helped her be
the most recognisable British Winter
athlete.
The Canadians will be looking to
dominate their home Olympics, with
Manuel Osborne-Paradis carrying the
expectations of a nation in the alpine
downhill events, while the Austrians
and Swiss will be bringing strong and
on-form teams to battle it out for the
medals. The women’s alpine events are
dominated by the American Lindsay
Vonn who, returning from injury this
season, has dodged jibes about her
weight.
The events may not provide a great
opportunity for British victory, but
they will be enthralling all the same
and at least we are sure to beat the
Aussie’s in the medal table. Aren’t we?
