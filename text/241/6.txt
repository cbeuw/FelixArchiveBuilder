6 FELIX
J A Z Z S C E N E '67
"Jazz Scene '67" will be the
highlight of the year for the IC
jazz club and may be the only
time many students will really
come into contact with jazz here.
Even so,. the Jazz Club will be
Organising or participating in many
functions throughout the year for
your entertainment.
This session will be one of the
most active in the history "
o
f the
Club and certainly there will be
few weeks when jazz will not be
hoard in public at IC. There have
always been daily rehearsals held
internally in the Club but this
year it has become much more ex-
trovert with numerous concerts of
a more or less formal nature.
On the more formal side—if that
is the word—we heard several well-
known professional bands playing
in Wednesday evening "Cellar
Sessions" last term, notably Dick
Morrisey's Quartet and the Graham
Collier Septet.

Less formally ICs own bands
were to be heard playing regularly
on Sunday evenings in collaborat-
ion with the Folk Club. These ses-
sions became very popular last
term and happily they have been
continued.
For this term, replacing the Cel-
lar. Sessions, we are holding a
series of mid-week Southside
Stomps thinning this evening
(18th;. In the past, these jazz dances
have been a great success thanks to
their reasonable prices, good music
and their unique atmosphere,
which has become quite famous.
Jazz Records
Jazz on disc may be heard re-
gularly in the Jazz Club room
above the Union bar at the lunch-
time on Thursdays when recitals
are held. Anyone interested is al-
ways welcome.

The idea for a Jazz Week at IC
(Jazz Scene '67) was born from a
feeling that the enthusiasm of the
musicians of the Jazz Club was not
finding suffcient outlets owing to
the comparatively few opportunit-
ies to play before live audiences.
The Jazz Club at IC has in the
past produced some very good
music and musicians but lack of
external stimulus can lead to the
Club becoming introspective and
finally apathetic.
It was felt that the Jazz Club
could play a much greater part in
Union activities and involve its
non-musicians to a greater extent.
The best way to carry this out is
to improve the Jazz Club image by
bringing it before the eye of the
average Union member in as forc-
ible way as possible. It is hoped
that Jazz Scene '67 will make an
impact on all Union members,
particularly those responsible for
organising Hops, etc. It is probably
not realised that the average jazz
musician is willing to play for the
sheer pleasure of playing, so that
groups from the College Club will
normally be happy to play for a
nominal fee (or beer!).
During the week of Jazz Scene
'67, besides the presence of out-
side groups and personalities, there
will be 'Jam Session' evenings
during which College groups and,
we hope, groups from the other
Colleges will play. These sessions,
will be very informal and should
provide a lot of good music.

Do you want a jazzband of your favourite style? IC Jazz Club can
supply it—at modest prices of course. This may be a slight exaggeration
but certainly the jazz club spans the whole field of jazz with its present
selection <at bands.
The three broad divisions of
jazz today—trad, mainstream and
modern jazz are each represented
by an accompished band. In ad-
dition we have a very versatile
piano band group, an-up-and-com-
ing trad band and the nucleus of
a big band.
ICs trad band is the "Splinter
Group" led in paths between 1915
and 1930 by John Franklin on
trumpet. This band emerged 'from
the "Royal Garden Stampers" of
1964 and has gone from strength
to strength ever since. It is regular-
ly seen at parties, carnivals, etc.
The mainstream contender is
die "Clay-Holt 6" co-led by Roger
Clay on trombone and John Holt
on tenor sax. Though it has only
been in existence for one term it
has made swift progress, probably
because of its composition of ex-
perienced musicians. Again, as for
College bands in general, parties
and hops are its main dish.
More way-out concepts L are
available from the modern "New

Jazztet" under the guidance ot
John Henry, President of the Club.
This organisation is now in its
second year and with a line-up of
alto sax, trumpet and flute presents
a unique sound.
Clive Heath, our pianist of re-
nown is to be found in many guis-
es from bass player to arranger.
With his collaborators he has for
several years been a force behind
the club both musically and
managerially. Usuany to be heard
in his trio he may with luck be
heard with his friends in quartet
and quintet.
Latest band
Our latest band is a second trad
band, the "New Jazz Group" un-
der the leadership of John
Matthews on clarinet. This band
now seems to be over its teething
troubles and is looking forward to
a bright future.
This then is the range of IC
jazz bands, pleasantly complete,
somediing to suit your taste and
your pocket.
