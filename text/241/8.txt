A warning has been received
that the Pooh Club are planning a
Woozle Hunt in London Under-
ground. The hunt will combine
business with pleasure, since all
those taking part will carry collect-
ing tins; the prize for the 'success-
ful woozle discoverer will be an
undisclosed sum of money taken
from the proceeds of the collect-
ion. At present the details are
vague—'Sometime later this term,
somewhere in the underground''—
but the chief problem is the
identity of the woozle, for by its
very definition, no one knows what
a woozle looks like—a crafty
dodge!
It has been brought to the
notice of the Pooh Club that the
once extinct Heftalump has been
seen roaming the London Under-
ground.
Piglet, who has never seen a
Hehalump, is offering a reward for
its capture.
A hunt for it will be organised
in the next few weeks. All pro-
ceeds will go to the Carnival
Charity. C. R.

During the final week of last
tenn ten students from five Europ-
ean mining schools visited the
HSM. There were six Frenchmen,
two Dutchmen, and two Jugoslavs.
Apart from visits to the bar, the
visitors were given a coach-tbur
around London,, shown the academ-
ic side of Mines, and subjected to
an industrial visit. Evening activ-
ities included the Christmas din-
ner, carol singing, and watching
wrestling. The climax of the week
was their attendance at the Mines
Ball; and with the help of ICWA
all seemed to enjoy themselves.
During the previous week seven
Minesmen had enjoyed the hospital-
ity of mining establishments in
France and Sweden.

The Mountaineering Club's
winter meet began on Boxing Day
and during the six days that fol-
lowed the key . adjectives were
'gripping' and 'epic' with the co-
efficient of friction in the cuillins
of Skye reduced to a minimum by
ice and snow, and weather condit-
ions varying from moderate to ter-
rible, intrepid deeds were com-
monplace. Reserve parties attempt-
ing to retrieve items of gear lost
in the snow on the mountains were
repulsed by die conditions; and one
group spent half the night climb-
ing down the mountain arriving at
the bottom, just in time to meet
the search party. Despite tradition-
al New Year's Eve revels, climbing
went on the next day, and no
serious falls were recorded. On the
2nd day the club, left the splend-
idly well-equipped Glen Brittle hut
only to get stuck in snow halfway
down the Highlands. Eventually
even this obstacle was overcome,
and all returned home without
father mishaps, save the attentions
of a police patrolman.

Following their very successful
production of "A Penny for a
Song" last term, the Dramatic Soc-
iety lave chosen for their Easter
production a play I. Kopit en-
titled : ' "Oh Dad, Poor Dad,
Mamma's hung you in the closet
and I'm feeling so sad."
As the title may suggest, this
play is somewhat less conventional
than previous productions over the
lasl few years. It is a mocHrn j-iay
(it was first performed at th Lyric
Theatre, Hammersmith), and was
written by Mr. Kopit foi an under-
graduate group in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. He describes the
play as "pseudoclassical tra<ri-
farce in a bastard French tradit-
ion '; the New Statesman describes
it as "a Freudian phantasy." In
any event it is an exciting play,
full of drama which shows the
struggle of a son to liberate him-
self from a wilful and domineering
mother.
The play is to be produced by
Roger Haines and will be per-
formed from the 13th to the 16th
of Marsh. .

In Unilever,
management is more
than a career...
... it bas acquired the status of a profession and, as such, requires
highly developed skills - skills that are never found ready made. For this
reason we have evolved a comprehensive system of management training and
development for young men and women of outstanding calibre.
Unilever is the sixth largest company in the world, with about 300,000
employees in 80 countries. We make and sell consumer products which are
household names and produce raw and manufactured materials for other
industries.
A high proportion of the management of this widely diversified company
are graduates. For 40 years we have been systematically recruiting students
from Universities.
