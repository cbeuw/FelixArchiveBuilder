Bawdy night for Folk Song Club
Trevor Lucas
Photo r D. Ormiston
An evening of songs ranging
from the simply non-serious to
wliat might best be described as
bawdy was provided for the IC
Folk Club at its last meeting by
singer Trevor Lucas. The few
members who attended gave a
good reception to all his songs, a
reception which grew better as
the evening progressed and which
was in direct proportion to the
bawdiness. Interspersed with his
songs were jokes and stories about
the relative merits of English and
Australian accents.
Trevor Lucas played to an
audience containing mainly singers
and committee members. He is an
Anglicanised Australian of two
years standing and sang English
and American songs as well as
Australian ones. Also performing
were the usual residents and the
evening was a considerable suc-
cess despite the small audience,
which increased slowly but never
reached the size of the usual
crowd.

What would you do with
£25 million a year?
We're investing it in an expansion programme to increase production of nylon
polymer, polyurethanes and other organic chemicals including dyestuffs, and to
step-up research effort over a wide range of organic chemistry. We make an
unparalleled range and number of products —over 6,000—which sell
throughout the world because they are good. But we want them better still
and new ones, too.
Like to join us?
In the course of the next few months there will be opportunities for Chemists,
Chemical Engineers, and Mechanical Engineers to share in this important and
interesting development. If you are hoping for a good honours degree or
are carrying out post-graduate work and are interested in living and working
in areas with a character of their own and good amenities, including housing
among the most inexpensive in Britain, we will be glad to keep you advised
of the opportunities and to let you know about salaries and conditions of
service, which, we are confident, you will find attractive.
Simply write to Mr. H. J . F. McLean, Personnel Department, ICI Dyestuffs
Division, P.O. Box 42, Manchester 9, stating the field in which
you are interested. Please quote reference 1.77/F.

A survey of psychiatric services
in universities in the United King-
dom and Eire is being conducted
by the Editor of T.C.D., the
weekly magazine of Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin. The psychiatrist or
Student Medical Officer attending
the university or college is asked
to complete a questionaire request-
ing details of the services provided,
the frequency and forms of ment-
al illness among students and
opinions on any specific factors
which might induce mental illness.
No statistical analysis of the results
is intended, they will simply be
used as a pool of information to
produce an article for the magaz-
ine. It is hoped that FELIX will
be able to print this article when
it appears later this term.

Ramadhan, the fasting period,
ended on the 12th of January. It
is followed in the Muslim calends
by a series of feast days, and to
coincide with these, an Islamic
mission is being held by the
Islamic society, with the cooperat-
ion of the Turkish, Arab and
Pakistan Societies. Involving five
days of dinners, lectures, films and
. an exhibition, the mission runs
from the 16th to the 20th of
January. The purpose of the mis-
sion is to give a wider understand-
ing of the Islamic way of life and
religion, and all members of IC

consist mainly of photographs and
posters is to be on display in the
Mech. Eng. concourse,

dustrial and economic progress, and
the artistic aspects of the Islamic
nations. A series of lectures will
also be held, all on the sixth floor
of the Mech. Eng. building, and
on Tuesday evening the Pakistan
Society have arranged for Sir
Harold Shoobert to speak. On
Wednesday evening a number ot
films covering Islamic countries
will be shown, and Thursday
evening is given over to the
Turkish Society. The Mission cul-
minates on Friday with a Grand
Dinner in the Islamic manner; all
irrespective of religion, are wel-
come to attend. Tickets cost 7/6

In the last issue FELIX reported
that Sir Willis Jackson had been
awarded a Baronetcy. This is not
correct, his honour was in fact a
Barony, a considerably higher
honour. The error is regretted.
