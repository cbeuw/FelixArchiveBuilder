go out and mix with people
again . . . "
F.P. of Norwich
"... at last something that
actually works."

spots but they have almost
gone now".

ON SATURDAY, Decemb-
er 10th, an incredibly soggy
Parliament Hill course was the
scene of the U.L. Cross-
country Championships. The
I.C. club, who are having
their most successful season
for many years, expected to be
in the running for second
place, and hopes were high
before the start. The compet-
ition was made keener by the
fact that the race also funct-
ions as the I.C. Champion-
ships, and there was much
friendly rivalry between mem-
bers of the constituent col-
leges. Furthermore, Mines
were determined that R.C.S. should
not have their usual walk-over and
were fielding a very strong team—
including Nick Barton, a former
British junior miler and Kings Col-
lege student; Tony Mason, a first
year Minesman of great ability;
and 'old lag" Howard Smith, last
year's IC Champion.
The race started fast but soon
slowed down to become a long
battle against the slippery condit-
ions. After the first lap Barton was
lying second, and in that position
he finished 43 seconds behind Pete
Yates of U.C. The overall result
gave IC 1st team, third place,
only 4 points behind L.S.E.; and
therefore a share in the trophies.
Mines successfully carried off the
college title with the help of
Franklin, an unknown as far as the
cross-country club was concerned,
who ran • in 26th position.
The success of the club this year
is mainly attributable to the keen
and capable freshers. Besides those
already named, special mention
should be made of Chris Macosko
(U.S.A.), who was IC's 5th man,
and Alan Mowat (8th man).

AT LAST WORK has com-
menced on the college's sports
centre,—I say at last because
many people were beginning to
wonder if it would ever become
a reality. Talk of the building
was in circulation when I first
came, to college, and that was
five years ago. The ma:
n delays
seem to stem from finance (a not
unusual story), but also from
planning troubles. The plans
themselves were ready in 1963,
and the space has been there fcr
quite some time.
Nevertheless work has rvr ••
so we should be f'"^' *
would probably prove difficult to
justify an academic establ's!"-
ment having such facilities. The
future college sports facilities
should be extremely good, with
Harlington already one of the
best sports ground in U.L. The
opening of the centre should
prove a great help to a number
of clubs who have been forced
to look all over London, for
help in getting the use of spaces.
The Rifle club will soon have a
home of its' own,—originally
they used a range below the old
Guild's building. The Swimming
club will now have a pool, to-
gether with the Water Polo and
Under Water Swimming clubs.
As the college is right in the
middle of South Kensington, we
should consider ourselves lucky
to get the land, let alone the
mcfley. So let's hope that the
work is finished on time, unlike
South Side, and that the users of
the building treat it with the re-
spects it warrants.
