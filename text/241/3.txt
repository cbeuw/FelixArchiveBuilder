Christmas was hardly a time of
goodwill at Birmingham. "Totally
unacceptable" was how Mike
Redhouse, treasurer of the Guild of
Undergraduates, described a letter
from the University Council telling
of its decision on the censorship
of riujcnl publications.
At an emergency meeting of the
Guild Council, proposing a motion
which rejects this decision and
which was passed nem con, he said,
"We must take quick, vehement,
unqualified steps."
The trouble began when the
Guild secretary was instructed by
the Vice-Chancellor to remove an
article of criticism about one of
the halls of residence from the
Wall magazine. The article was re-
moved and replaced by a letter
from the Vice-Chancellor.
Guild officials thought that this
would be the end of the matter,
but the University Council went
on "to ask the Guild to provide
the Registrar with copies of all
Guild publications immediately on
publication", instructed "each copy
of 'Wall' to be signed and certified
by the president of the Guild or
the available Guild officer next in
seniority", and informed 'the
Guild that if matter appears in
Guild publications which is judged
by the University to be offensive
to members of the University staff
or a hindrance to them in the per-
formance of their duties, the
Council will hold the author, edit-
or and Guild liable to University
disciplinary measures."
President Tony Klug commented
that the events "Must not be in-
terpreted as a weakening in the
Guild's long-standing reputation of
responsibility, but rather as reveal-
ing an inadequacy in the Guild's
present maclunery for the control
of its publications. It is the
Guild's responsibility to improve
its own control."
Conflict at
Loughborough
The question "who holds the
whip ?" has been raised at Lough-
borough following the rustication
of three students for the removal
of a sign at a Nottingham hall.
The Union Council argues that it
would have been more appropriate
had it meted out punishment—
suspension from the Union for a
term and a fine of not less than
five pounds—but the pro-Vice-
Chancellor considered this a case
where the university's prestige and
reputation were involved.
Of the Union Disciplinary Com-
mittee he said, "It might be as
well if the UDC confined itself
to matters directly concerned with
union affairs in the first instance.
When the committee has gained
some experience it will probably
be able to take complete control
of discipline."
Reviewing N U S
membership
Newcastle University is review-
ing its attitude towards the Nation-
al Union of Students. By three
votes, however, the Students' Re-
presentative Council rejected a
proposal that the NUS committee
be disbanded and its functions
be taken over by the SRC welfare
committee.
The rejection of a change to a
single transferable voting system
at the recent NUS conference ag-
gravated Newcastle's situation. The
Union in November stated that it
may review its continued member-
ship if STV is not adopted at
Easter.
Courier
B u n g l e d k i d n a p
A pressman covering the at-
tempt to kidnap Miss South Africa
at Cambridge in November de-
scribed it as "the most bungled
rag stunt (he) had ever seen".
Only slightly ruffled, she continued
as planned to speak against the an-
nual debate motion that "beauty
is only skin deep"; the motion was
defeated unanimously.
Varsity
Illegal canvassing
Allegations of illegal canvassing
in the "dirtiest union elections
ever" have been brought against
candidates for the presidency and
librarianship at Bristol, who were
accused of making a formal elect-
oral pact and conducting canvassing
in support of this. A Bird, who has
been previously fined, by the
union for conspiracy to canvas,
commented, "This seems to be a
smear campaign motivated from
personal spite"
Nonesuch
LSE review
of regulations
LSE has decided to set up a
committee with equal representat-
ion from the student population
which will undertake a complete
review of the School s regulations.
Student buys
freedom
After 35 days detention in a
Greek prison awaiting trial follow-
ing a car crash, a Birmingham
graduate was sentenced to six
months in jail for "murder by
neglect". Within three months,
however, his family raised the
money required to "buy" his re-
lease.
Maintaining that another driver
was to blame for his accident, i e
claimed that prison conditions
were "incredibly inhuman" and
demoralising.
U N S A
Nitin Som, currently Vice-
President of the International Re-
lations Club at IC, was recently
elected a Vice-President of the
United Nations Student Association.
His election took place at the 21st
Annual Conference held in Cardiff
from 2nd—6th January. This
event has been gaining in popular-
ity in recent years and as many
as forty branches from universities
all over the country sent delegates
this year. The International Relat-
ions Club was represented by a
full delegation.
Political manoeuvres have never
played a great part in past UNSA
Conferences and this year was no
exception. Delegates debated vari-
ous domestic, national and inter-
national issues, first in specialised
commissions and then in full
plenary sessions. The system was
found most satisfactory, enabling
delegates to examine an issue at
depth. The policies thus formulat-
ed on South-East Asia, Southern
Africa and Economic Development
had therefore the merit of
thorough investigation. A major
UNSA project—Teaching of Inter-
national Affairs in schools—is now
well advanced and the report of
an extensive survey is due out to-
wards the end of the year. An
emergency debate on Overseas
Students' fees condemned the de-
cision and the Association decid-
ed to resist any increase.
All in all is was a most stimulat-
ing time. The hospitality of the
Cardiff branch who were the host,
and indeed of the Welsh people,
will be the envy of Edinburgh
where next year's Conference will
meet.

t h i n g s c a n be very difficult when you get out on your
own. Everything suddenly, frighteningly expensive. Ends
hardly ever seeming to meet. The Westminster can help
you, as it helps thousands of young people every year.
1. As you get into your stride. You'll soon have money
decisions to make (types of insurance, mortgage problems,
and so on). Your local Westminster Manager has immense
experience of such problems. Let him help you draw up a
personal budget that will give you a chance to build up a
small reserve of capital.
2. The price of success. The more successful you are, the
more expenses you will have. And the more you'll need
to keep track of where your money's going. Clothes,
entertainment, foreign travel, children's education. The
Westminster gives you a precise record of how you spend
your money and will pay all your regular bills by ' standing
order'.
3. When you reach the top. Sooner or later you'll have to
invest quite substantial sums of personal capital. The quality
of your life after retirement depends on how you do it. The
best advice comes from someone who knows you. That's
when you're doubly glad you joined the Westminster early,
and built up a good relationship with your Manager.
4. A word about your Manager. His instinct is not to
warn, but to help. Call in on your local Westminster
Manager—you'll see what an up-to-date bank can do. And
you'll probably find he is prepared to reduce the cost of your
bank charges in the early years of your career.
Have a talk this week with your local Westminster
Manager. Ask how he can help you in your career. The
Westminster has over 1,380 branches in England and
Wales. Head Office: 41 Lothbury, London, EC2.
