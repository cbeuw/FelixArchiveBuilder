Crime &
Punishment
Punishment may be said to be
deserved by the offender, or it
may be said to deter or reform—
each of these views will be exam-
ined in turn by Mr E.R. Honderich
in his series of General Studies
lectures. In the first of these he
began by defining punishment and
then defended his definition against
various lines of attack. He then
went o nto consider the first of the
three justifications of punishment—
the doctrine of retributivism.
Arguing very lucidly, Mr.
Honderich attempted to show that
most arguments in support of this
view are absurd and untenable.
He destroyed the notion of equival-
ence between offence and penalty
and also showed that the principle
of equal treatment for equals, un-
equal treatment for unequals in the
relevant sense, does not logically
lead *to a view that punishment
should be imposed. If the criminal
makes himself unequal in the re-
levant sense, the unequal treat-
ment might be reward—and it
does not even follow logically
from this principle that unequal
treatment need be initiated at all.
Mr. Honderich thought that the
most forceful argument against this
position consisted of the assertion
that man should not be made to
suffer unless good comes of it. He
briefly stated the retributivist view
of Hegel, but as this seemed to
depend upon moral principles hav-
ing a sort of existence, this Seemed
to him absurd.
This very striking lecturer, tall,
trans-Atlantically-accented and
clutching a fistful of beads con-
cluded the lecture' by perambulat-
ing himself round the lecture
theatre inviting comments. So suc-
cessful was this, that the chairman
invited Mr. Honderich to deliver a
shorter lecture next time.

Last Friday morning the
Wooden Horse Club effected the
removal of the mascot of North-
ern Polytechnic & National Col-
lege of Rubber Technology. The
mascot is a rather tatty tapir
(see footnote) answering to the
name "Horace".
Several preliminary excursions to
tile College had made it obvious
that Horace did not like his sur-
roundings there-—after all, how
would you like to be chained up
in a dingy Union lounge r This re-
sulted in its removal to the rather
more pleasant surroundings of IC.
The Club decided that the re-
moval could most effectively be
carried out during the first few
minutes after the Union opened.
Twenty Wooden Horse Club mem-
bers duly arrived at 8.30 and en-
joyed a cup of coffee in the Poly
Cafe opposite, some even had
breakfast.
• The tapir was removed by cut-
ting the case-hardened steel chains
which used to secure it to a rail-
ing arrangement around him. The
mascot was then transported, via
an emergency exit, to a waiting
van parked nearby. ' Unfortunately
Horace was too big to fit inside
the van while still attached to his
stand, so this was carefully remov-
ed and sent back in another van.
After posing for photographs in
front of the College, complite with
cloektower, which was .two rxu»utes
slow at the time, the successful
uiaacoLeers returned to IC.
Horace was later displayed in
the bar and seemed to take an in-
stant liking to Howard, as the
picture shows.
"The mascot was not damaged
during the raid and the first clue
has adalrey been set, so, if Horace
is to be returned to its owners it
seems they have got to do a bit
of detective work
Apparently, stuffed tapirs are re-
latively rare items these days and
we are informed that the Zoology
department does not possess one.
It seems a pity that it has got to
be returned.
A tapir is a distant relative of
the elephant and looks rather like
a long-nosed pig. They live in
Malaysia and some parts of South
America and are believed to be
vegetarians.
