South African Universities
Sir,
I refer to your newsletter which
contains the following item :
Tn view of the total lack of
universities for black South Afric-
ans in Soudi Africa, it is planned
to set up an IC South African
Student Appeal Fund. The aim of
this fund is to bring a black South
African to this country to study at
IC for three years. The fund would
pay his fares and give him a little
grant for his stay here of the order
of that given to other students at,
IC. The carnival charity can make
an, invaluable contribution to get-
ting this fund well on the. way to
the required £2000.'
This is not a true representation
of the facts. Usually we would not
feel compelled to react to such a
statement, but as a request for pub-
lic money is involved, we feel
that perhaps you would like to put
the record straight. There are
three Bantu university colleges
catering exclusively for Bantu
students in South Africa. They are
the University College of the
North, catering specifically for the
Bantu peoples of the northern
Transvaal; tie University College of
Zululand—^for the Zulu nation in
Natal; and Fort Hare, for the
Xhosa people of tire Transkej. The
standards of instruction at these
colleges are laid down by the
University of South Africa, which

" also the examining body.
The University of South Africa
is unique in many ways. It is not
fwly an examining body but is also
$, teaching university—by corres-
jpondence. Students axe from all
national groups in South Africa,
tacluding our Bantu population,
groups. I should also mention that
many applications for enrolment in
toe Bantu University Colleges are
regularly received from outside
the Republic's borders, particular-
ly from students in Lesotho,
botswana and Swaziland—so many
in fact, that it has been decided
to award places at these colleges
for & limited number of foreign
Bantu students only. The reason
for this is that we would rather
accommodate our own Bantu
students.
J.J. BEYTELL
Information Attache
South African Embassy
Ed.: The Student Technologist# de-
fines a university college as 'like
a university and doing university
work, but . . . lacking the power
to grant degrees'.
Sir,
I should like to take the op-
portunity of replying to Mr
Beytell. As he so rightly says, the
University of South Africa is
unique in many ways. There ara
indeed African university colleges
in South Africa but these would
not classify as universities in a
sense accepted in this country or
even in the normal white South
African sense. 40% of the students
at these colleges are not even tak-
ing degree courses. The academic
standards are low and the salaries
of the professors and lectures are
considerably lower than those re-
ceived by their colleagues in the
white universities. Professors, for
example, receive £450 less per an-
num. Added to this, African teach-
ers receive less still than their
white counterparts and they may
not in normal circumstances teach
in a white university. Thus the
money spent per head at these
colleges is considerably lower
than at other universities. Even
the capital cost is lower. It is
noteworthy that the e imated
capital expenditure on the two
colleges of the North and 1
of
Zululand is £400,000 each. This
may be compared with the
£2,000,000 to be spent on the first
stage of the similar institution at
Ibadan to cope with two-thirds of
the number of students expected
at the two Bantu colleges.
There is at these colleges no
such thing as university autonomy,
a freedom respected almost
diroughout the world this side of
die Iron Curtain. They are under
the direct control of the Minister
for Bantu Education.

ed or who would like to know

Union successes...?
Sometimes it is pleasing to be proved wrong. Having spent several
hundred words wondering, in past editorials, why the Union does so
little that is constructive, I am reassured to find that there are people
who care. Probably the best news of late has been about Carnival.
Carnival looks like having its best year yet if the results to date are
to be typical of the year. Even Jerry Stockbridge, who must take a
large amount of the credit for the success, confesses to being somewhat
amazed. But he alone is not responsible; probably a major factor has
been die decision to move Carnival into the constituent Unions and
thus make it part of Union life rather than just another Union organ-
isation. The Vice-PVesidents have done excellent work in ensuring
that the Union members have known what is going on, with the result
that several hundred pounds has been collected by each Union. Indeed,
this year the whole group of people associated with Carnival seems a lor
keener than was the case last year. The prospects are good; this in
itself is a good situation, because if Carnival had done badly for two
years in succession, its very future existence would have been doubtful.
T o o m u c h m o n e y ?
Perhaps there js a tendency among the organisers to concentrate
solely on the task of collecting money for this very worthwhile charity.
The procession is unlikely to take place because it is a great deal of
trouble and only raises £100 and the Dramatic Society's revue may be
reduced to one night because it does not make very much. The organis-
ers seem to forget tiiat people take part in Carnival, not out of any
sense of righteousness from 'doing good', but because they enjoy it.
Carnival exists not only to collect money for charity but to provide
enjoyment and entertainment for th« members of the Union.
A c h a n c e f o r i n d e p e n d e n c e
One of the other worthwhile events to take place this year, was the
effort made by Rob Collinge and one or two others in preparing his
report (in this issue), which could materially affect the future of the
Union. The Robbins report makes it quite clear that the increase in the
number of places in Halls of Residence should keep pace with the
number of students—this has not happened in general though IC is better
oft than many colleges. In the near future the number of students in
IC is going up to 4,700 thus decreasing still further the ratio of hall
places to students. Student Houses would be independent of the College,
being run and owned by the Union. This opportunity to establish the
Union as a responsible body with the intelligence to increase its own
facilities must not De missed.

Sir.
This is a letter of protest conT
cerning a claim made in a recent
edition of FELIX, that you have
Successfully stolen the mascot of
Battersea . College of Education.
While regretting the offending
Guildsmen"s lack ot taste in birds,
we are happy to inform you that
our mascot is still with us.
It seems odd that, while deplor-
ing the unethical conduct of Mike's
captors, you condone the same
behaviour in your own students.
