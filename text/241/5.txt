Sir.
I have just been taught how to
solve a Second Order Differential
Equation for about the fifth time
in eighteen months. I don't mind
the repetition all that much; after
all, I have nothing personal against
Second Order Differential Equat-
ions, and they are an important
topic in my field of study. What
I resent are the reasons behind the
repetition.
Obviously, five lecturers have
needed to use the method during a
lecture, and weren't sure whether
anyone else had taught it to us.
You'd think that anyone compiling
a course would first find out what
we had been taught, or alterativ-
ely when we are going to be
taught it. I've lost count of the
number of times that lecturers or
experiments in practical periods
have used material from other
courses which we either haven't
finished or else haven't even start-
ed.
The other important thing in a
course is of course the lecturer.
Students are selected on the basis
of their academic ability; why
aren't lecturers selected on the
basis of their teaching ability ? A l -
though I like a system in which
a lazy student is not compelled to
work, I don't see why it follows
that a bad lecturer should not be
compelled to improve his lecturing.
He lectures for our benefit and if
he does the job badly, something
should be done about it. There is
not even any official channel that we
can use to tell lecturers how good
or how bad they are.
Of course, we do have good
lecturers too. One of ours has just
completed twenty lectures, accom-
panied by an almost verbatim tran-
script running to about 150 print-
ed foolscap sides of "notes", copies
of which were circulated among
the audience. I enjoyed his lectures,
but they were almost a complete
waste of both his time and ours.
Finally, there are those minor
matters like courses which end in
November, and which we are exam-
ined on in June with no refresher
course in between; courses which
begin in the Summer term a few
weeks before the exams; and
chunks of a course beig cut out
of an exam I suppose I will be
told that if we had worked harder
during the year these things would
be no ..problem. But we are at
university to learn (among other
things), and I see no reason to
learn the hard way when there is
an easy one. The end, not the
means, is important.
Isn't it time that someone sat
down and actually thought about
what is taught, when it is taught,
and how it is taught ? How about
the revolutionary step of actually
asking the students which courses
are best laid out and best timed,
and, especially, which, by name
are the good and the bad lectur-
ers, and why ? Or does nobody care
about the people on the receiving
end ?

But as I said, I don't really mind
being taught how to solve a
Second Order Differential Equation
five times in eighteen month. Per-
haps at the sixth time it will sink
in.

On learning that University Col-
lege had procurred IC's mascot
MIKE, members of , W.H.O.
(Wooden Horse Organisation) 'pre-
pared a fiendish plot. The official
mascot of UC is the new 660 foot
GPO tower which has previously
ben thought unstealable. Using the
superior scientific and technological
resources available within, the Col-
lege, the members of W.H.O. pro-
duced R.A.P.E. (Reducing And
Polarising Equipment) which is
capable of reducing the height of
• the* tower to 5mm and the mass
correspondingly. The extra mass is
converted into energy and trans-
, mitted to the final site where .:
t is
stored until the arrival of the re-
duced tower.
I n t o a c t i o n
So on Tuesday 10th January the
Three Mascoteers, under the
auspices of R.N. Hayfork proceed-
ed to the foot ef the tower and
prepared to RAPE it. The appaiat-
us was tested on an offensive buie
who subsequently crushed under a
falling snowflake.
The tower was rapidly reduced,
placed in a match-box and a life-
sized cardboard replica erected in
its place so that the GPO would
not be inconvenienced. The
miniature tower was carried to IC
and by means of RAPE was recon-
stituted and placed in the middle
of the Guilds Quadrangle.
N o w i n v i s i b l e
So as not to arouse the wrath of
the College authorities by scarring
the campus with this hideous
structure, a permanently polarising
invisibility barrier was erected
around the tower.
IC is proud to have effected the,
first theft of this mascot. For many
centuries to come, no other col-
lege could be equipped to even
locate this former lar. !. . —such
is the stab; ;
technological ad-
vance at IC.

Sir,
At least a week before the col-
lege closed for vacation, the table
tennis bats were removed and God
bless the Secretary, who has not
yet realised that the college has
reopened.
