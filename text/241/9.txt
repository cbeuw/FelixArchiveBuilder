ICGC GOES TO SCOTLAND
Over the New Year, seven mem-
bers of IC Gliding Club ran an
expedition to the Scottish Gliding
Union's site at Portmoak, Kinros-
shire. This site is well known for
producing 'wave' lift in which
high altitudes may be attained.
Two gliders were taken, the club's
Skylark 4 and a Dart 7R owned
by Frank Irving, a vice-president of
the club.
During the first three days
weather conditions were poor and
little or no gliding took place.
However, on the fourth day, two
members succeeded in reaching
6,000 feet in a small wave system.
But, on the last day conditions
were perfect and a large wave
system was seen over the site.
Frank Irving, flying his Dart and
Ron Cosser (Chemistry PG) suc-
ceeded in reaching 15,000 feet,
using oxygen equipment. This
flight contributed to Ron's Gold
' C * gliding badge and two other
members, Ian Ronald and Howard
Torode achieved Silver ' C height
gains. The expedition was consider-
ed an unqualified success, all mem-
bers vowing to return at a later
date, possibly next Christmas.

The amnesty on refectories cut-
lery, crockery and glasses, which
was held at the 'end of last term,
appears to have had a limited suc-
cess. Deputy President Dave
McBain said that about a hundred
glasses and a certain amount of
cutlery had been returned. How-
ever Mrs Barge of the Union re-
fectories said "that no knives had
been returned and there is now a
distinct shortage of knives. Com-
plaints about the lack of knives
have been made and a member of
Council has suggested that more
should be purchased.

The Sporting section of RCS
Union is now in search of a new
leader, as a result of the loss of
Dick Conn, who left last term.
The nomination papers, posted at
the weekend, were the first step to
the election of a new Vice-Presid-
ent. If more than one candidate
appears, the hustings are arranged
"to be held on Thursday 26th
January, and the election on
Monday 30th. The result of such
an election would be announced
during the Union Meeting on
Thursday.
Dick Conn gave notice of his re-
signation to the President Keith
Cavanagh on 5th November, when
it was apparent that he would be
unable to obtain a grant for his
post-graduate studies. He spend
the" remaining weeks of term ar-
raging such events as the highly
successful collections at the
London Rail Termini.
The main duty of the new Vice-
President will be the continuation
of the RCS effort in Carnival, and
hence the successful candidate
should be familiar with Carnival
activities and a competent and
diligent organiser.

MIKE-where are you?
Ralph Cornforth admits that at
present he has no knowledge of
the whereabouts of MIKE, which
as now has been missing for five
weeks. It was traced last term to
University College lAion, who
sent Ralph a Christmas card pro-
misina the first clue on the first
day of term. Since Christmas, how-
ever, reports have come b;ick to
IC that MIKE is now in the
custody of City University in the
company of PHINEAS, one of
UC's mascots. Certainly no clues
have appeared by which to re-
cover MIKE.
