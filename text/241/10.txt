FELIX carried out a survey
to determine how the average
IC student spends his time
outside the lecture theatre. A
random sample of the whole
student body was taken. Partic-
ularly we wanted to find out
to what extent the attractions
of London drew the student
away from the IC social scene.
How many students positively
gain by Living in London ? What
was the difference in attitude to
IC as an undergraduate progres-
sed from i first to his third
year ? We ranted to compare,
too, the atti de of science stud-
ents to that f engineering and
mining studc.s. In this arcticie
we publish some of these re-
sults and some of the attitudes
found.
A survey conducted on the leisure of I.C. students has brought
some surprising trends to light. Freshmen arrive at I.C. full of
naive enthusiasm and a fervent desire to drink deeply at the well
head of knowledge, to participate fully in the I.C. social scene
and to centre their life on the campus—a campus providing 'The
University Life'. By their second and third years, however, this
commendable attitude has changed—their fervour has been blunted.
Many have deserted I.C. as a centre of social activity in favour
of London itself and the desire to live in Hall has declined. Bv
the time one is a posteraduate, IC is a place in which to work;
postgraduates in general live, and want to live, away from the
College and seek their entertainment in London rather than the
Union.

FELIX printed a number of
forms to get the facts for the
survey and a random number of
names were taken from the faculty
lists. The forms were distributed
and a response of 40% was obtained.
In addition students were ap-
proached in various faculty en-
trances. A small but significant
sample was obtained. Average
figures given appear small, but the
variation in activities, and the
hours involved for individual
student was vast.

The table given summarizes
some basic results. A compar-
ison is made between first
years and older Undergraduat-
es and secondly, between those
in engineering and mining and
those in the sciences.
