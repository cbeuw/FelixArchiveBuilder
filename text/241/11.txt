FELIX 11
trend away from IC as the average
student progresses appear frequent-
ly. Strangely enough average sports
Darticipation rose from 11 hours'1
a
week for the average undergradu-
ate to 2 hours a week for post-
graduates but this could easily be
a quirk of our particular sample.
Much more significant, from the
point of view of social participat-
ion, is the time spent in clubs, at
hops and in pubs both at IC and
elsewhere in London. While a
freshmen spends 22% of his leisure
time at IC social functions, the
corresponding figures for post-
graduates drops to 10%. More
dramatic is the increased use made
by second year, third year and
postgraduate students of what
London has to offer. First year
students spend only an hour a
week in outside cultural activities
and twe hours in London pubs.
The postgraduate student, how-
ever, spends about 4 hours a week
and 31 hours a week on these act-
ivities respectively.
Why then is there this progres-
sive movement away from IC ?
Most students feel that the variety
and quantity of extracurricular
activities at IC are high but sur-
prisingly few make any real use
of them. Moreover, the use made
of them declines with time spent
in College. It appears that the
freshmen are attracted while their
colleagues have acquired a more
wordly and cynical attitude to-
wards the student life. As they
mature, students look more and
more outside the College for en-
tertainment and relaxation. The
man referred to cynically as the
'brown-bagger' who only spends a
9.00-5.00 day at IC, may well be
the man who is getting much more
out of living in London than 'the
lads' in the Union bar, outdrinking
each other.
SCIENCE-
MINING and
ENGINEERING
STUDENTS
A similar trend to that above
is found between students in the
science faculties on the one hand
and those in engineering and min-
ing on the other. While the no,-
age science student is more active
in his leisure, thjs activity is direct-
ed away from IC. Less likely to be
at toe union bar, ac trie baturuay
uupsi, or m IC social clubs, be is
more iiiceiy to be on the sports

his engineering colleague.
tie spends considerably more time
tnan others at concerts, cinemas,
jazz and beat clubs and in London
pubs.
ATTRACTIONS
of the
METROPOLIS
London, as a capital city, as a
world c i.tte for music, for theatre,
as an intellectual hub, must in-
evitably attract large numbers of
students away from the smaller and
mure confined College life. An
attempt was therefore made to
establish the numbers of those who
were 'IC orientated' and those who
were London orientated'. 'IC
orientated' was defined as he
whose social life and interests
were mainly centred on IC. That
is of the total number of hours
a week spent in a gregarious man-
ner, he who spent the majority of
hours at IC or in connection with
an IC activity. It was found that
about 26% of students were '1C
orientated while 35% were
'London orientated'. IC therefore
as a University College, suffers
from its existence in the metropol-
is; but, what of the remaining 39%
who could be classified into neither
group!' Presumably they are not,
as has been suggested, inactive in
every direction. FELIX could find
little that they did with their time!
Gaining little from the College, or
the city, they might as well be in
the wilderness of Sheffield or
Durham!
APATHY
and EFFORT
THE LADS
Again the eagerness of the
freshmen to look to IC appears,
for 40% of first year men were
'London orientated', compared
with the aveiage of 26 %. This
can be partially explained by
the fact that 'the lads' from
the Union Bar while doing most
of the organising of events in the
College, nevertheless form a clos-
ed group from which most stud-
ents are excluded. This fact prob-
ably discourages many from at-
tempting to make the college
The question of responsibility of
a member to his community arises.
To put it more bluntly, are stud-
ents responsible for their own
social life in the College ? Clearly,
they are. Are we then to ascribe
the general disuse of existing facil-
ities to apathy ? Not entirely—for.
imperial College lacks several
facilities which make the other
Uiversity of London colleges at-
tractive. One is the lack of women:
single girls at IC are outnumbered
by their male colleagues by at
least 14 to 1, making IC an es-
sentially male preserve. There is
also the question of accommodat-
ion. The average student lives 3
miles from the College and requir-
es over 20 minutes travel time to
get to and fro. This fact must, to-
gether with the lack of women,
discourages many from returning to
IC in the evening.
What can be done to im-
prove the state of students here ?
Clearly the greatest priority must be
given to accommodation on the
campus. For the most part, how-
ever, responsibility for improvment
lies with the student himself. The
University of London, despite its
wide programme of cultural and
social activities is almost totally
disregarded by IC students. \s for
women, we have the Royal Collect
of Art and numerous secretarial col-
leges next door. RCA girls are said
to look down on us with scorn but
their attitude can obviously be
chaneed. It's your life—get out and
use it I
