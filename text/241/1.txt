Report on housing
Over two thirds of the students at Imperial College spend more
than 70% of their grant on food and accommodation alone. This
is one of the many facts revealed in a report produced by Rob
Collingt'. a second-year engineer. The report is based on a 10%
survey taken last term among IC students living in accommodation
other than the College Halls of Residence. The survey was taken
as it was felt that the standard of student housing had declined
to a level where the student is no longer reaping the benefits of
education in London.
The Robbins Report noted in 1963 that 'there is every sign that
in most places the limit of available lodgings has now been reached.
Indeed, if we consider the nature of some of the lodgings in which
circumstances oblige students to live, the distances that they are
forced to travel to their work, the lack of privacy—there are
cases where three students share one study bedroom—and the
absence of any kind of supervision, it can be said that the limit
has been passed.'
The Collinge Report found that
only 40% of those in the survey
had facilities for private study. Of
these, one in three lived at home
or in other hostels of the univers-
ity. The Robbins Committee ob-
served that the student needs some
form of privacy— a room of Jiis
own—through his university career
and the Russell Report, produced
recently by Bedford College notes
that 'the need for privacy is not
mere psychological or tempera-
mental; it is academic*. The
Collinge Report notes 'It must be
a matter for grave concern that
so few Imperial College students
the have the conditions of privacy
necessary for study.'
Traveling time
It was found that two-thirds ot
students spend more than an hour
each day in travelling between the
College and their housing. The
average time spent was l j hours
and nearly 1
0
% of students spent
more than two hours per day in
travelling. The report concludes
that these figures may account for
the reluctance of many students to
make the journey to the facilities
of Central London and the difficulty
many find in taking an active part
in the social life of the College.
Conditions
Students were invited to grade
the conditions in which they live.
The report concludes however, that
the results of this may not be ac-
curate as many would be disin-
clined to admit to living in slum
conditions and' 'fair' was taken as
a neutral answer. Most said that
they lived in fair conditions and
•
> few in excellent.
The University Lodgings Bureau
was used by 45% of students but
only 50% of these were satisfied
with its service. Those who used
it had better conditions but tend-
ed to be further away from the
College. Of the many complaints
received about the bureau, the
main one was about the small
number of flats it could provide:
.it appears that there is a large
'demand for flats rather than digs
or bedsitters. In view of the
generally high demand for accom-
modation there is probably little
that can be done by the bureau to
obtain higher standards.
The report concludes 'that the
typical IC student is not in an en-
viable position. He must pay high
prices and has long travelling time.
Even after this inconvenience, the
student does not live in conditions
most conducive to study. Indeed,
it seems strange that the Depart-
ment of Education and Science con-
tinues to expand and imDrove the
teaching facilities in London whilst
apparently, sparing little thought
for the students who are to use
them. The time for action is now.'
S tudent Houses
During the current credit squeeze
it seems unlikely that the £1 mil-
lion or so needed to build a Hall
of Residence could be obtained by
the College. Rob Collinge points to
a solution in the form of Student
Houses. Such houses flourish in
the USA in the form of Fraternit-
ies and are owned by the student
body and run by the residents. As
no new buildings are required
they can provide student accom-
modation more quickly and more
cheaply than Halls of Residence.
In the Kensington area many 99
year leases are currently about to
fall-in and if the Union were to

H.G. Wells Society, who conduct-
ed the survey and wrote the
report on housing conditions.

H.G. Wells Society, who investigat-

and the possibility of establishing
one at IC.
buy some property, now is the
time.
The capital cost per student is
estimated at £1,500 in this area
compared with £2.000 for a full-
scale Hall of Residence. By work-
ing in smaller units, capital of
£30.000 to £50.000 would be
needed instead of the £1 million
for a Hall of Residence. Running
costs would be covered by rents
a»d letting to foreign students
during the vacation.
'Student Houses would therefore
seem to be a solution to the lodg-
ing problem that could be im-
plemented rapidly and cheaply if
the source., of capital were avail-
able'.
The report was presented to
Council at its last .'ting by
Deputv-Prc :;dent D( .. McBain.
Council accepted it and, recom-
mended that the Welfare Officer
Pete Finch should investigate the
possibilities of raising the neces-
sary capital.
Note: A deputation from NUS
met senior officials of the Depart-
ment of Education and Science on
the 17th January to discuss student
housing.
Hardship for overseas
students?
The Government plans for in-
creased fees for overseas students
could severely effect Imperial Col-
lege, which has proportionally one
of the laigest populations of such
students. In spite of the Govern-
ment scholarships fund to
meet the £ 50 fee for over-
seas students with official who
have already started higher educ-
ation courses the 3
4
% of over-
seas students in Britain who live
on £40 a month or less, will be
put in a more difficult financial
situation by these new measures
as a large proportion of them are
privately financed. Two thirds of
the overseas students now in
Britain receive no financial support
except that from their families.
On January 3rd Geoffrey Martin,
President of the National Union of
Students, said that the Union re-
gretted that Ihe Department -if
Education and Science had taken
such an important and far reaching
step, which will drastically reduce
the number of students in Britain
from the developing countries.
The provision of places at col-
leges and universities for these
students is one of our most valu-
able forms of overseas aid, but
the new Government measures will
not only deter new students com-
jng to Britain, but will..,force
students already studying; h
