12 FELIX
A Humanist-Jesuit ?
Members of Imperial College
who were present at the first de-
bate of the session will remember
the reasoned arguments of Arch-
bishop Roberts. Although he often
engages in debate with humanists,
as tor example in a contribution to
a series of articles in "Punch" last
year, his views are not fundament-
ally opposed to humanism. He can
be heard again at General Studies
on Thursday 9th. February, during
Teaching Week.
Archbishop Roberts combines his
Jesuit discipline with a radisal ap-
porach to beliefs Christian. His
moral courage rides above the re-
straints of his Church and his
views on matters both sacred and
secular are worthy of consideration.
LFJ
Joint Christian Societies
On the first Friday of term the
first of a new series of lunchtime
meetings arranged jointly by the
Christian societies was held. A
similar series held in previous years
on Mondays clashed with a
Christian Union meeting and it is
hoped that the new time will 'cad
to an increased attendance.
The Guild of St. Raphael is a
fellowship for those who desire to
work and pray for the restoration
of the healing ministry of the
Church. Its chaplain addressed the
meeting on the tehology of healing.
He set the question in the content
of theology as a whole, whien he
saw as being concerned with our
knowledge of God from our own
experience, aided by the insights
of others. By healing we should un-
derstand that we are concerned
with the wholeness of the complete
person, not only bodily disease.
At future meetings the chaplains
to the various societies will be
speaking.
