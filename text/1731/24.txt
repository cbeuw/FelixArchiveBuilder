BOOKS

C
eleste Ng once
again has taken
me on a bumpy
ride of secrets
and fears that will leave
me absolutely breathless
with Everything I Never
Told You. Ng is the kind
of writer who has keen
eyes for one’s deepest
and darkest desires, and
you can feel every char-
acter’s flesh and blood as
if you’re living their life
as them. She chooses the
tell the narrative through
a third-person omnisci-
ent point of view, and
although she often skips
around from character to
character, the story still
flows and never feels out
of place at any point. One
may frame the story as
the identity crisis of an
Asian-American, but I
think it’s more of a vessel
Ng utilises for us to see a
bigger picture.
The story began with
the sudden disappearance
of Lydia Lee, the beloved
daughter of James and
Marilyn Lee. James came
from a family of Chinese
immigrants, and despite
being born and raised in
the States, struggled to
fit into American society.
Marilyn was an aspiring
doctor who had wanted
anything but her mother’s
vision of her being the
perfect housewife. Upon
their first encounter, they
saw in each other their
innermost desire, one des-
perate to blend in whereas
the other eager to stand
out. Thus begins the story
of the two and their three
children.
We see through the eyes
of each sibling as well as
how Lydia’s death affects
each family member. We
see James seeking comfort
by having an affair; we
see Marilyn trapped in
immense guilt. We see
how Nath recalls the other
side of Lydia, the one who
craves just a little bit of
love and comfort; we see
Hannah sees past Lydia’s
smile that doesn’t reach
the eyes.
Piece by piece, it even-
tually became clear that
Lydia had drowned in the
lake, and the plot unrave-
led slowly as we learned
how one expectation after
another piled up on Lydia,
with James projecting his
social insecurities onto her
and Marilyn forcing her
onto the path of science.
There’s very little left she
looked forward to, and in
her quest for an answer,
she returned to what she
deemed the beginning of
her unhappy childhood
and found her ending
there in the lake.
I could not pinpoint
why exactly I resonated
with the story, just like I
could not pinpoint what
exactly the story is about.
It’s a subtle, quiet family
Another masterpiece by Celeste Ng featuring a family drama surrounding the suspicious death of a young girl.

“Ng has keen

deepest
and darkest
desires”
“An unsettling
journey that
forces me to
redefine family
and sacrifice
and empathy”
drama where each charac-
ter came alive with Ng’s
writing. The motivations
and feelings were crafted
with such intricate details,
and I was beyond awe
with how the characters
are deftly interwoven
together. It moved from
the search for a simple
question to an unsettling
journey that forces me
to redefine family and
sacrifice and empathy.
Yet it covered so much
more beyond the issues
of family, race acceptance
and gender equality - it’s
the loneliness of being an
anomaly; it’s the courage
to fight against fears and
expectations; it’s about
the search for identity;
it’s something universally
relatable. And that’s my
favourite kind of genre -
the seemingly depressing
with a glimmer of hope.
