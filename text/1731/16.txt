South Africa, France, Dance: An Unexpected Trio
P
ioneering South
African chore-
ographer and
dance, Maqoma
created “Cion: Requiem
of Ravel’s Boléro” a few
years ago, imaginatively
setting his story inspired
by South African litera-
ture against the music of
Ravel’s famed orchestral
piece, Boléro. Maqoma
founded Vuyani Dance
Theatre in 1999 with the
vision to build a platform
for South African artists,
and in this performance
he takes centre-stage
playing Toloki, a profes-
sional mourner based on
the protagonist of ‘Cion’
and ‘Ways of Dying’ by
Zakes Mda. He is joined
by eight other dancers, and
together a piece unfolds
exploring themes such as
death, loss, and religion
through the medium of
dance. Maqoma created
this rousing piece as a
commentary on the polit-
ical events of not only his
home country, but similar
ones globally.
The inspirations for this
show couldn’t be more
different – two pieces
separated by continent,
culture, and time. But
the music, reimagined
through percussion and
voice, live by the Soweto
Gospel Choir, suited the
performance perfectly.
In fact, the stirring,
transformative harmonies
of Siphiwe Nkabinde,
Sbusiso Shozi, Simphiwe
Bonongo, and Zandile
Hlatshwayo was my fa-
vourite part and deserves
a special mention.. Their
singing was truly beauti-
ful, and at times haunting.
Nhlanhla Mahlangu was
the music director who
composed this interpre-
tation of Boléro that this
South African a cappella
quartet sung.
I’m no expert when it
comes to dance, but the
intensity and dexterity,
the changes from fast
and energetic to slow and
lamenting, the control and
rhythm, dancing individu-
ally and then as one form
– it was extraordinary.
In particular, Maqoma’s
solos were masterful. As
soon as the dancers start
moving, you’re com-
pletely entranced. I never
thought I could sit still and
watch people move like
this, with no words, for 70
minutes straight, but the
time flew so quickly – it
felt like you were being
hypnotised.
Set in a graveyard, the
piece takes you through
a journey of emotions
that come with death in
a modern world where
“we have all become
professional mourners”,
according to Maqoma.
This show will keep
your brain ticking for
hours after it’s over, and
the subject matter was
so relevant to this day
and age. Unfortunately,
the show was only at the
Barbican for a few days,
but the show encouraged
me to expand my horizons
when it comes to the arts.
I’d recommend you look
out for the next Vuyani
Dance Theatre piece!

Donizetti’s
c l a s s i c
comedy, Don Pasquale
(Dom Pa-Skwah-Lay), at
the Royal Opera House.
The opera buffa stays true
to its origins with a large-
ly untouched storyline
but successfully brings its
characters into 2019. The
result is fabulous: think
traditional opera singing,
but the song is about
discovering shady mes-
sages on your partner’s
iPhone. Don Pasquale
was an instant success
when first performed in
Paris in 1843 and judging
by the copious laughter
on opening night, this
revamp has been met with
equal enthusiasm.
Don Pasquale’s
dramatic storyline is
resonant of an episode
of MTV’s Catfish with
the aged and tyrannical
Don Pasquale giddily
marrying his dream bride,
the beautiful convent girl
Norina. Within seconds of
the diamond ring slipping
onto her finger Pasquale
learns that what you see
isn’t always what you get.
Far from his smooth-sail-
ing ‘happily ever after’,
an artfully constructed
tale unfolds – brimming
with hilarious antics and
scheming – all at the
expense of poor Pasquale.
As the characters grow
more evil, the humour
gains a darker, almost
sadistic tone. Regardless,
Don Pasquale is undenia-
bly funny – I’ll guarantee
you’ll laugh out loud.
Opera heavyweight
Bryn Terfel offers a
touching lead perfor-
mance as Don Pasquale
by bringing a delicate
vulnerability to an other-
wise despicable character.
Olga Peretyatko dazzles
as the bewitching Norina
with glorious vocals and
exceptional comedic
delivery. One should
note the show is entirely
in Italian and that the
subtitles (neck-breakingly
displayed at the very top
of the stage) are often
incomplete or confusing.
Despite this, the cast’s
expressive performance
and Evelino Pido’s
superb conducting craft
a captivating atmosphere
to compensate for the
occasional lack of under-
standing.
Paolo Fantin spares
no expense when con-
structing his dynamic set:
with a sports car wheeled
on stage, hilarious use
of a green screen and
a house rotating on a
platform. However, while
Fantin’s ambition must
be applauded, a lack of
attention to transitions
became disappointingly
apparent. Crumpled paper
airplanes thrown within
the first five minutes of the
performance sat strewn on
the stage for the rest of the
opera. Puppets needed for
a later scene were callous-
ly placed at the front of the
stage, waiting to be picked
up. In addition, Fantin’s
use of props swings from
minimalist to overly
detailed throughout the
show. Certain mundane
conversations were staged
beautifully, while other
pivotal fights took place
in poorly defined spaces
on the side of an old set.
Overall, while admit-
tedly remaining visually
striking and achieving its
desired comic effect, the
stage was occasionally
left feeling either cluttered
or incomplete.
While far from a con-
ventional student activity,
Don Pasquale offers a
fresh avenue to anyone in-
terested in exploring a new
format of entertainment.
With modern staging and
a dramatic storyline, the
performance is a fantastic
hybrid of traditional opera
and modern performance.
