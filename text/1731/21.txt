Foundations of Hip Hop: The Memphis Underground
“...created
dreamlike
soundscapes
that would
serve as the
basis for the
SoundCloud
and mumble
rap artists that
followed.”
“The Memphis
scene has
taught us
that what’s
considered
underground
is dependent
on time and
location.”
M
emphis hip
hop emerged
from the
underbelly
of Memphis, Tennessee
in the early 90s. While
the genre was distinctly
underground, it has per-
vaded through decades
of hip hop that followed.
Characterised by dark lo-fi
production, triplet flows,
and repetitive hooks, the
subject matter consisted
mainly of street tales from
Memphis ghettos with
occasional references
to the occult. Samples
from horror movies and
soul drum beats were the
finishing touches to the
hypnotic music you find
in the cassette tapes of the
era.
The short choruses and
minimal synth melodies
that were commonplace
in the region went on to
shape much of the future
American club scene.
Three 6 Mafia, the most
famous artists of the
original Memphis cohort,
birthed the crunk sound
that was later expanded
on by other artists in the
South. Over the next 15
years, trap would evolve
out of crunk, but it wasn’t
until it re-acquired some
elements of the Memphis
sound again - for example,
thetripletflowpopularised
by the Migos originated in
Memphis - that it filtered
into the mainstream and
began dominating the
charts. And artists are
aware of this. Recent hits
like “Look Alive” and
“Powerglide” pay direct
homage to the originals.
Outside of the South,
Chicago had started to
develop its own sound
– drill music. And while
drill was mainly built
off trap with the help of
people like Waka Flocka
Flame and Lex Luger,
Memphis managed to
trickle in again. Chief
Keef’s breakout hit, “Love
Sosa”, that transported
drill across international
waters, uses a flow from
the Three 6 Mafia song
“Stomp”. Drill rappers
don’t worry about met-
aphors and other lyrical
tropes, instead focussing
on gritty violent lyrics
akin to those from the
Memphis era. Both cities
share heavy poverty and
rife gang culture that
combined to produce
captivating music rooted
in realism.
And this DIY ethos
in the scene wasn’t a
conscious stylistic choice
but, rather, a reflection
of the area’s reality. The
distinctive drums (like
the 808 cowbell) resulted
from producers being
forced to experiment
within the limitations of
cheap drum machines.
Producers would use
the same samples and
sometimes sample each
other’s music, creating a
very recognisable sound.
Most artists would have to
make hand-drawn flyers
and try to sell their tapes
at the local record shops.
They didn’t care so much
for lyricism as they did for
style and atmosphere, and
this focus on aesthetics
is integral to many of the
hip hop subgenres that
followed in the 2000s
onwards.
The influence is espe-
cially prominent in the
internet genres that grew
out of the late 2000s like
cloud rap and phonk.
Cloud rap is one of the
biggest subgenres that
took clear inspiration
from Memphis’ focus on
atmosphere and mood.
Many of its biggest propo-
nents, like Clams Casino
and Sad Boys, created
dreamlike soundscapes
that would serve as the
basis for the SoundCloud
and mumble rap artists
that followed. In many of
these genres, the focus on
music is as important as
the visuals - cloud rap and
another microgenre called
vaporwave both have
artwork that takes inspi-
ration from the layout and
symmetry of Memphis
album covers.
Phonk was popular-
ised by one of the most
important underground
producers in hip hop,
SpaceGhostPurrp (SGP).
A member of Raider
Klan, alongside promi-
nent artists like Denzel
Curry and Xavier Wulf,
SGP gave his spin on the
Memphis sound with his
2012 album Mysterious
Phonk: Chronicles of
SpaceGhostPurrp. He also
worked alongside one of
the other main producers
of 2010s Memphis-style
hip hop, Lil Ugly Mane
(LUM). While SGP’s
work followed the mould
of the 90s work, LUM
took the production and
revamped it for the 2010s.
His underground classic,
Mista Thug Isolation,
is an over-the-top take
on hip hop culture that
adds emotive synths and
jazzy samples to the core
sound. Without these two
producers and Memphis,
entire subgenres may not
have existed and dozens
of artists along with that.
This musical effect
became more apparent
when an emerging group
of SoundCloud rappers
started to build up a cult
following around the
world. Suicideboys and
Ghostmane are two from
that crop of artists that
popularised the trap metal
sound. They hover across
a dark lyrical spectrum
that draws on a lot of the
horrorcore imagery from
Memphis, combined with
ideas from heavy metal,
industrial, and emo music.
Both of these artists sharp-
ened the original Memphis
aesthetic to give it a more
abrasive edge, combining
the drum patterns with
more distorted bass and
vocal aggression.
Looking outside of
American hip hop, the
impact is still there.
British artists Dizzee
Rascal and Novelist both
pioneered a faster, colder
form of grime called Ruff
Sound that takes inspira-
tion from the Memphis
underground. The drums
are skippier, and ice-cold
synths replace the eerie
pianos, but the sinister
feeling of gangs in
impoverished inner-city
estates remains - it’s a
distinctly English take on
the Memphis sound. Early
Memphis adlibs and hooks
still get sampled fre-
quently in modern music,
occasionally beyond hip
hop - alternative pop artist
Blood Orange has used
samples from Memphis
legends, Project Pat and
Tommy Wright III, on his
last two projects.
The Memphis scene
has taught us that what’s
considered underground
is dependent on time and
location. It may not have
been the biggest genre
when it was around, but
years later the impact is
felt globally. Unfortunate-
ly, since this influence is
often indirect, the scene
doesn’t get the acknowl-
edgement it deserves. But
one thing is for certain,
the cascading number of
subgenres spawned by
hip hop retain some part
of the original Memphis
scene’s DNA, even if they
don’t always know it.
