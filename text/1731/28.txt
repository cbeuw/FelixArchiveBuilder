POV: The 2019 CTWC - The Year of Upsetris
F
ollowing on
from last week’s
article covering
the Classic Tetris
World Championship, it is
time to share the results!
It took place from the
19th - 21st and I was
following it the whole
way. Friday started
fairly low-key. A quick
Dr. Mario tournament
followed by a speedrun
competition in Tetris: first
to level 19. Surprisingly,
last year’s champion,
Joseph Saelee, lost quite
early on in the speedrun
contest... I guess he was
just warming up for the
real action.
Saturday was the first
day of qualifying, in
which there were some
very notable highlights.
Firstly, Joeseph qualified
first (surprising no one)
but to everyone’s amaze-
ment he did this with at
least 3 max outs, (the
max score you can get is
999,999). The qualifying
had many fresh young
faces, including Batfoy...
who would go on to come
4th place which will
be covered later. Many
people are accounting
the reason for this influx
of young players being
the success of 16-year olf
Joseph Saelee last year.
Following this trend of di-
versity. it was nice to see
more women take part, in-
cluding one player’s wife
who managed to demolish
him in qualifying.
The Sunday was the
real show though, top 36
the clash of the titans. The
day started with two major
upsets. Two of the three
previous winners Harry
Hong and Jonas Neubauer
both were knocked out
at the start of the day.
This shocked the Tetris
well, causing everyone
to dub the tournament as
the tourney of ‘upsetris’.
Even weirder still is the
player that beat 7-time
world champion Jonas did
not manage to get through
to the next round.
Top 8 was wild. A
showdown of veterans,
Terry and Koryan,
showed the world how
big of a skill difference
can come with continued
practice. Koryan practices
every day, even when
he is not playing Tetris
he taps a portable button
to keep his fingers fast.
This was evident in the
absolute destruction that
was Koryans 3-0 victory
over Terry. Joseph went
against Green Tea in
probably the best match of
the tournament. The first
game saw both players
get to the kill-screen (the
end of the game which
is so rarely reached in
tournament). The next
game saw Joeseph get
the first-ever max out
in a head-to-head tour-
nament setting, causing
the commentators to go
crazy. But nothing would
prepare them for the next
game which saw a max
out from BOTH Joseph
AND Green Tea - truly
extraordinary. Batfoy the
15-year-old newcomer
was sadly beaten by 40+
year old veteran Koryan.
This meant that Koryan
met joseph in the final.
A hotly contested match
was finally clutched out
by Joseph, winning by 3-2
when Koryan topped out
early at 200,000 points.
Joseph was awarded
a beautiful trophy and
$10,000 by Alexy
Pajitnow, Tetris’ creator.
An emotional moment
and a great competition
by all!
POV: Super Mario Bros. Film Because That Exists!
T
his week I sacri-
ficed my Sunday
evening to watch
(again) the horrif-
ic video game movie that
is “Super Mario Bros.”.
Directed by Rocky
Morton and Annabel
Jankel, the film was both
atrocious in its directing
and actual content, with
so much miscommuni-
cation between previous
directors and Nintendo
that the eventual product
was a gritty mushroom
kingdom complete with
strippers (I wish I was
kidding). What makes
this film even worse is
that fact that it features
a star-studded cast with
Bob Hoskins as Mario,
John Leguizamo as Luigi,
Dennis Hopper as Bowser
- a role that was offered
and turned down by both
Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Michael Keaton -
and Samantha Mathis as
Princess Daisy. Now you
may be thinking that the
film surely could not have
been that bad, to which I
would reply, “the actors
actually drank on set in
order to get through this
movie” and “Bob Hoskin
described it as the worst
job he has ever done and
the biggest mistake of his
life”. In both directing
and content, the film was
awful.
Heaven help me, I was
going to write a whole
section about the story …
but realising how many
“crucial” details I would
leave out has led me to
advise you to read the plot
from the wiki page – it
paints a better picture of
the film’s LSD-esque
nightmare then I will
ever be able to achieve,
literally one of the lines
from the wiki reads
“Koopa informs Daisy
that she descended from
the dinosaurs, believing
only Daisy can merge
the worlds because of her
royal heritage”, which
is completely accurate
to the film. Allow me to
provide you with further
examples of how poorly
things crossed over from
the game to the movie, for
starters, Goomba are now
7 feet tall monstrosities
that are built like a brick
shit house and have heads
the size of an 8 ball, Yoshi
is a small but somehow
creepily adorable ve-
lociraptor, the entire city
of Dinohatten- I kid you
not, that they actually
called it that- is coated
in white fibrous material
which is apparently the
remains of the king that
has been turned into a
sentient fungus. Last but
not least the film features
Mario teaming up with a
tight leather clad dance
floor queen named Big
Bertha – that’s not a
crossover I just thought
I’d mention that. The
wonders of Hollywood
continue to amaze me!
If you’re going to watch
the movie (which I advise
you do), watch it like the
actors: drunk.
