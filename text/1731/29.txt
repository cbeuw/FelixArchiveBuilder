Ring Fit Adventure - Review: Buff Dragons and
sentient Pilates rings... what more do you need?
A great game for fitness fanatics and gamers alike. Jump into a mythical world and battle demons... with your
abs! A intense daily workout for anyone, anytime, anywhere!
T
he latest in a
long-running list
of Nintendo’s
whacky pe-
ripheral ideas: Ring Fit
Adventure, fight demons
whilst doing pilates.
Last month Nintendo
announced the game
seemingly out of nowhere.
The premise is odd, attach
a joy-con to your left leg
via a strap and attach
another to the top of a
Nintendo-made, plastic
pilates ring dubbed the
ring-con. The joy-con’s
inbuilt gyroscopes can
measure (to a surprisingly
high precision) the move-
ment of your upper and
lower body. The game
uses this premise and
pushes it to its max with
multiple immersive game
modes and a jarringly
intense workout to boot!
When I first popped in
the game, I was given very
detailed instructions on
how to attach the equip-
ment and how to follow
the in-game prompts.
You control the menu by
spinning and turning the
ring-con which is very
intuitive. Before playing
the main story, I attempt-
ed to storm through all
the mini-games. There
is a wide variety of
mini-games which target
almost every muscle
group. While playing the
mini-games there is an
on-screen guide, called
Tipp, which shows you
the correct way to do the
exercise without injuring
yourself. This self-care
theme is very prevalent
in the game. Nintendo
knows that a large portion
of their fanbase doesn’t
necessarily know a lot
about fitness; there are
always tips on how to eat,
how to do the exercise and
constant reminders to stay
hydrated. Given that I had
to play an average of 4
hours per day to complete
this review, the water re-
minders were a godsend.
Other than minigames
you also have the option to
do challenges, where you
do one basic exercise such
as pulling or squeezing the

ring-con as many times as
possible in 20 seconds.
You can compare your
scores with friends and
is very enjoyable when
you don’t have enough
time for a full work-out.
If you have even LESS
time, there is a great
option to play while doing
something else… In my
‘breaks’ I watched Netflix
while squeezing the ring
against my shoulder.
After an episode or seven
of The Good Place, I turn
the game back on and
behold it measured all
of my squeezes, telling
me how many calories I
burned and giving me a
job well done!
Where the game shines
though, is in its story
mode. You jump in with
a short opening sequence
that sets up the story: The
evil Dragaux (a super
buff dragon with gains
for days) gets released
from a ring and goes on
to wreak havoc in the
neighbouring villages.
The ring turns out to be
a sentient being, aptly
named Ring, and together
with him, you have to
track Draguax down and
defeat him! Not the most
imaginative story but for
a fitness game I will allow
it. The gameplay involves
jogging on the spot to run
forward, doing knee-lifts
to climb up stairs and
squeezing or pulling Ring
to shot or suck in air to
collect coins. These coins
can be spent on clothing
for the avatar character.
There is a wide variety
of options, a welcome
addition given the very
poor initial character cus-
tomisation.
Running on the spot
effectively means that
the game is very linear,
with only a couple paths
you can take in each level
(almost like a 2.5D plat-
former).
However, the main
reason that this game goes
beyond your typical RPG
is the combat sequences.
At some point, you will
run into white glowing
enemies, which will start
the fight. The monsters
are hilarious re-imaging
of exercise equipment,
such as a crab-like
dumbbell or anthropo-
morphic kettlebell. You
fight in typical RPG style,
with various offensive
moves doing different
amounts of damaging and
targeting 1-5 enemies.
The unique aspect is that
each move is an exercise.
I never thought I would
be doing 26 squats to take
the basic enemy down
to half health but here
we are. Each exercise is
grouped into 1 of 4 types:
Core, Arms, Legs and
Yoga. Once you get past
the 2nd world even more
strategy opens up where
certain types of moves
hurt certain monsters
more. This cleverly opens
up a way of making you
do a whole body work out
if you want to progress
through the levels. I found
myself switching from
an under-arm press to
chair-pose to knee-lifts
just so I could survive a
fight against 3 different
monsters.
I am yet to finish the
game but at the moment
I am loving it. The pe-
ripherals are so precise
that sometimes I forgot
I was even exercising. I
guess that is the true mark
of a great fitness game.
Possibly the best part of
Ring Fit Adventure is its
massive amount of diffi-
culty variation. It asks you
The game is as whacky as it looks here, I can promsie you that // Engadget
your sex, height, weight,
fitness level and how diffi-
cult you want the game to
be and makes, from what
I can tell, a bespoke dif-
ficulty level that changes
each exercises rep count
as well as resistance.
This is great as it makes
sure that you are always
pushing yourself as far as
you want. Whether you
are a complete novice or
a fitness pro you will find
benefit from this game,
it even measures your
calories and heart rate at
the end of each level to let
you know how hard you
have been working!
If it is not clear already:
I loved this game. If you
are interested in getting
fit but love video games
too much, this is truly an
excellent middle ground,
with humorous charac-
ters, great music, limitless
replayability and a good
workout to boot! If you
were put off by Wii Fit,
fret not. This beats Wii
Fit by miles and I thought
very highly of it. For what
it was trying to achieve,
Ring Fit Adventure excels
in every aspect.
