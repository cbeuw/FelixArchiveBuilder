A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
sessions – but over the
summer, speedbumps
which should have been
foreseen popped up, and
just as I began the DPFS
role I stumbled into the
middle of it. As a result
of those, we haven’t
been able to deliver the
offering we wanted to,
and the project is now ‘on
pause’ while we reassess
the viability.
Felix: What sort of
speedbumps came
up?
FH: It was things like the
College needing space
to clean up the kitchen
after 7pm, but the Union
needing access earlier
than 7pm to do prepa-
ration – these sorts of
logistical issues just kept
cropping up. This should
have been noticed, but it
just wasn’t for a variety
of reasons. There were
also equipment issues –
the use of equipment was
never fully specified, so
the Union thought they
could use one thing and
the College had different
expectations, and every
time this happened it
meant another item on the
planned menu couldn’t be
delivered. For example,
storage space – to prevent
risk of cross-contamina-
tion, the Union and the
College would have to
store food in separate
spaces, especially if the
Union changes supplier
as has been considered.
Also, a lot of the equip-
ment is broken – I believe
the College factored
this in when deciding
to close the late service,
as the cost of repairing
it wasn’t worth it if they
were operating at a loss.
There now has to be a
discussion around who
pays for what.
It is hard in my role – I’m
joining the conversa-
tion halfway through.
Hopefully I can resolve
it this year, but if that
can’t happen, the same
situation will happen to
the next DPFS. It’s hard
to generate consistent
student-side pressure this
way.
Felix: Has staff turn-
over at the Union
contributed to these
miscommunications?
FH: I do think so. In any
team you need to trust
people, and trust that there
will be good handover.
Sometimes that happens,
sometimes it doesn’t – as
either an honest mistake or
because someone is trying
to get away with saying
they’ve done something
they haven’t until they can
catch up. It’s the nature
of working in any organ-
isation or business. The
thing is that this problem
is exacerbated when you
have high turnover – and
even for a student union,
we have high turnover. It’s
unfortunate that commer-
cial services at the Union
has had such a bad time
with this between July
and September, just when
all these things were being
addressed – so informa-
tion got lost in translation.
For example, we lost our
operations manager, who
sits just below the head of
the commercial services
directorate – but we have
the replacement coming
in on the 4th of November.
It’s hard to deal with then.
People step up and take
responsibility for things
that are not part of their
role in the interim, and
then you have someone
new joining, and have
to decide: do I trial them
by fire, or do I try to take
on more of the work
so I can ease them into
it? Which works better,
what’s the balance? It gets
overwhelming. All I can
do in my role is apologise
– there is no excuse for it.
But we’re bringing in the
new operations manager,
and have hired three more
bar managers to join Trish
who joined in August, so
once they are settled in
there will be no excuse
for the staff side of it not
being able to deal with
h-bar.
Felix: So the project
is officially on pause?
FH: Yes. Abhijay, the
Union President, and I
will talk to College over
the coming weeks to see
if there is a short-term
solution, and meanwhile
we’ll be assessing the
agreement made with
College as the premise
of it – that the kitchen is
ready-to-go – just isn’t
correct. Right now, the
best we can do is offer
small gestures, things like
toasties and hot-dogs, but
that feels really half-ar-
sed. We don’t want to do
that, it’s not acceptable.
We want to provide some-
thing in the spirit of a true
menu, rather than offer
a token to try to quieten
people and gloss over the
issue.
I’m keeping my ear to
the ground and listening
for if postgraduates
would prefer these small
gestures over no service at
all, but that’s not what I’m
hearing. I talk to the GSU
President, Mohit, about
this regularly, and do
get emails about it from
students. If I’m wrong
and that desire is there, I’ll
look into it, but only then.
Felix: What about
568? The‘Welcome
Week’menu lasted a
lot longer than just
the first week.
FH: We had the soft
launch in Welcome Week,
but realised we needed to
make tweaks to the menu
and to the presentation of
the food. We’ve all seen
the pizza on Reddit! So
we’ve tried to improve
quality control – which
caused a delay, but we
didn’t want to expand to
the full menu until we
knew we had the limited
one right.
Felix: So what was
going wrong in terms
of quality assurance?
FH: We’ve introduced
‘spec cards’ which detail
portion sizes and how
meals should be pre-
sented, so that whenever
you order a burger or
pizza it should look the
same every time. This is
new, something we are
trialling, and we’ve had to
get the chefs and kitchen
staff on board, as well as
encouraging floor staff
at the bar to take note
of food that needs to be
presented better and let
a supervisor know. That
just took some time.
Felix: Why has the
menu only been
changed now, if the
previous one was
dissatisfactory?
FH: I wouldn’t say it was
dissatisfactory – but if
you look at the old menu,
there were items that were
never being ordered, and
supplies for them just
took up space. Nothing
had changed in years – the
most exciting thing was
introducing sweet potato
fries – so it was time to
freshen it up, introduce
more fresh produce, and
to take up a better attitude
with regards to presenta-
tion. There’s no point in
offering a billion items for
the sake of it. If you want
to be good at it, you need
a smaller menu – that’s
what the best restaurants
do, so they can perfect
and finesse every dish.
We’ve now got healthier
and more seasonally
appropriate food – we’re
doing soups, for example,
and I’ve heard the hotpot
is really good.
Felix: So will you be
gathering feedback?
FH: Yeah – I’ve put QR
codes on all the tables,
which will take you
straight to a short survey
asking for ratings and
open-ended thoughts on
food, drinks, and service.
Felix: It’s been noted
that the prices have
increased again!
FH: They go up every
year. To clarify, we aim to
maintain the same margin
every single year – when
we raise prices, it isn’t
to increase profit, but to
maintain it. The issue is
that the cost of supply
has raised every year as
well. A few years ago,
the prices hadn’t been
updated in a while, and the
margins were getting very
tight – which meant less
money for clubs and so-
cieties. Our drinks prices
have also increased, but
that’s partially because
of our contract with the
supplier, which specified
that prices could increase
up to 40% over the three
year duration.
Felix: Is that not a
terrible contract?
FH: I don’t know the
reasoning behind it – the
people who signed it no
longer work here. We’re
back to that same issue
with passing down knowl-
edge and turnover!
Felix: Regarding margins
– it was noted that during
Welcome Week, there
were some very large ads
pasted onto the tables,
which has received some
backlash.
FH: That’s not actually a
decision made by com-
mercial services, and none
of the Officer Trustees
were aware of it prior. But
I don’t disagree with it. I
understand that it might
feel a bit cheap, and we
don’t want to give new
or returning students the
impression that we’ll sell
out for cash – but think
about where that money
goes. It goes back into
clubs and societies and
other Union services. The
good that we can do with
it is really valuable, and I
hope that along with our
events and the quality of
the bar we can outweigh
any negative impression.
Felix: Is there any-
thing else you’ve
been working on?
FH: Earlier I mentioned
signing off on sponsor-
ships for clubs and soci-
eties. I’ve introduced a
new system for it this year
which means I’m getting
through them a lot faster
as they come up, rather
than setting aside time
for it later – which never
turns out to be enough
time anyway. I’m also
trying to develop online
video tutorials for chairs
and treasurers to refer
to – it won’t be ready this
year but hopefully will
help next year. Currently
our training is really
good for people with a
bit of knowledge, but for
anyone who is completely
new it doesn’t work so
well. I get a lot of specific
queries about small things,
and am slowly gaining
an almost encyclopaedic
knowledge of random
VAT facts and such! So I
want to use that and turn it
into a more cohesive and
comprehensive guide.
