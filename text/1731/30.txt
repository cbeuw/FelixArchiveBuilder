The Gamiﬁcation of Apps

may be the best
way to max-
imise revenue
and grow the userbase
of your app. It’s a well-
known technique these
days, the darling of UX
developers everywhere,
and a fundamental part of
design. Once a niche, it
has become the standard
– integrated from the very
conception of an app idea.
The idea is to tap into
human psychology and,
being frank, to abuse
the ﬂaws in its structure.
Experiments such as the
infamous “Skinner’s
Box” or “Pavlov’s Dogs”,
which explored the use
of rewards in order to
condition animals to enact
certain behaviours, were
the starting point – but the
concept of reinforcement
and conditioning rapidly
expanded from academic
study to real-world appli-
cation.
Dopamine is a hell of a
drug. Gamiﬁcation relies
on integrating repetitive
behaviours into an app that
trigger reward patterns
in the brain, releasing
dopamine and tapping
into the human desire for
reward, self-expression,
achievement, competi-
tion, and status. This is
achieved by including
gaming-type aspects into
design – such as point
systems, achievements
represented by visual
symbols, leaderboards,
narratives, and avatars
representing the user.
Listing the techniques
brings to mind countless
examples of their usage –
from traditional gaming,
such as ranked systems in
video games or the reward
stimulus of slot machines,
to apps such as Tinder
or social media sites like
Facebook.
Tinder is perhaps the
best case study. The
mechanics of using the
app inherently prioritise
proactive but repetitive
motions – swiping left
and right. The same
functionality could be
achieved with a simple
button-press, but the
action of swiping is more
actively engaging as a
mechanic of operation.
There’s the additional
beneﬁt of the rapidity
of the action – instantly
offering gratiﬁcation and
lulling users into the idle
repetition of swiping over
and over, seeking the next
kick of dopamine.
Then there is the
reward loop – the satisfac-
tion of receiving a match,
accompanied by a ﬂash
of bright graphics and
sound. The use of visual
stimulus to push a sense of
achievement onto players
is longstanding, with slot
machines’tinny music and
ﬂashing lights being the
easiest example to-hand.
MMORPGs like World
of Warcraft also tapped
into this early – levelling
up was accompanied by
a ﬂash of golden light.
This doesn’t even touch
on extra features such as
“super likes” or “boosts”
– mechanics that have
deliberately limited avail-
ability, instilling in them
rarity and a sense of status
to receiving them.
The stroke of genius in
Tinder’s design, however,
is that it allows users to
deﬁne their own ‘win con-
dition’. While a tradition-
al game has clear goals
– such as levelling up –
Tinder broadens its appeal
by allowing for more
dynamic interactions.
Users are able to seek
different conditions to tap
their emotional reward
centre, depending on their
preferences. Some seek
reward in the number of
matches they receive,
never actually holding
a conversation or going
on a date; others by how
many dates or hook-ups
they can secure; others by
engaging in meaningful
conversations; and still
more by ﬁnding love.
These design aspects
– among many others –
have catapulted Tinder
ahead of other dating
apps. Including them in
your app design may well
do the same for you.

The concept of ‘gamification’ is not new, but more than ever before it is being deliberately integrated into app
design.
