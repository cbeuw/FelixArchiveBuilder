T
urkey has always
occupied a
s t r a t e g i c a l l y
significant place
in history. As the bastion
for the Byzantine Empire,
as the base for Ottoman
dominance of the Middle
East and as the gateway
to the Crimea, Turkey has
always been a valuable
prize. More recently,
Turkey’s membership of
NATO was a diplomatic
coup against the Soviet
Union, allowing for the
placement of short-range
nuclear missiles at the
doorstep of the Red
Empire. With the advent
of the Syrian Civil War,
Turkey has become an
ever more important re-
gional power player.
The Syrian Civil War
started in 2011. It has
evolved over time into
one of the most brutal
modern conflicts, killing
and disabling thousands
and creating millions of
both externally and inter-
nally displaced refugees.
The war is multifaceted,
with forces loyal to
Bashar Al Assad, Salafist
Islamist groups, mixed
Arab-Kurdish fighters and
Turkish backed militias,
fighting to secure con-
flicting political goals.
Bashar Al Assad’s forces
have received support
from Russian warplanes
and Iranian militias, the
Saudis sent funds and
arms to certain Islamist
groups, and the US, until
recently, supported the
Arab-Kurdish branches
of the Syrian Democratic
Forces (SDF).
Two weeks ago, a
conflict that had seemed
to reduce in magnitude
flared up again, when the
US decided to remove its
backing for the Syrian
Democratic Forces. Sub-
sequently, Turkey decided
to invade Northern Syria
and set up an exclusion
zone.
Turkey has taken this
decision for a variety of
reasons. The Syrian Dem-
ocratic Forces is the main
occupant of the contested
region. The SDF’s main
component is the People’s
Protection Units (YPG,
a Kurdish abbreviation),
Kurdish militias set up
to provide protection and
security in the region
of Syria following its
abandonment by Syrian
government forces. They
have proved to be the
West’s key ally in the
fight against Islamic State,
acting coherently with
Western special forces to
degrade and ultimately
destroy Islamic State.
However, the Kurdish
identity of the SDF is
problematic for Turkey,
as they accuse the YPG
of having links to terrorist
Kurdish organisations.
Kurds are a large minority
in South Eastern Turkey.
Terrorist campaigns run
against the Turkish state
since the 1970s in the
name of an independent
Kurdish state have killed
many Turkish civilians.
Naturally, the presence
of a heavily armed, com-
petent Kurdish force has
given Turkish security
forces much to worry
about over the past several
years.
However, there is an
additional factor that
must be considered - the
increasing aggressive
nationalism present in
Turkey over the past 20
years. Politics in Turkey
has had one man at its
center for the last sixteen
years. President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan was
Prime Minister from
2003- 2014 and President
from 2014. Over that time
Erdogan has survived
a violent coup attempt
against himself and his
government, as well as
bringing into force laws
that establish Presiden-
tial primacy. He has
also stoked controversy
both within and without
Turkey with corruption
scandals and attacks on
women and minorities.
The nationalist, violent
opposition to the creation
of an independent Kurdish
state, or even a region
of increased Kurdish
autonomy is entirely
within his prerogative as a
regional strongman.
These factors have
been the prime motiva-
tions behind the invasion
of Syria. The only reason
they had not yet been
carried out was the
presence of US forces
in the area. However,
Donald Trump, in yet
another piece of stunning-
ly blind diplomacy took
the decision to withdraw
these troops and give the
Turkish operation the go-
ahead.
The Turkish plan is
as well as damming
evidence that war crimes
have been committed has
come to the fore. Banned
substances such as white
phosphorous have been
observed to have been
used by militias loyal to
Turkey in direct contra-
vention of the rules of war.
Additionally, the assault
has created thousands
more refugees, as families
flee the assault. Fears of
Turkish ethnic cleansing
of Kurdish citizens are
widespread. The Turks
(and, to be fair, the Kurds)
are definitely not beyond
a little genocide, and then
denying it for the rest of
time.
The immediate impact
for the West and the
people living in the Syrian
conflict can only be said
to be negative. As well
as losing the goodwill

“It has
evolved over
time into one
of the most
brutal modern
conflicts”
to assault SDF positions
in concert with Turk-
ish-backed militia allies
and establish an exclusion
zone deep inside Syria’s
sovereignterritory.Turkey
then plans to resettle some
of the millions of refugees
that it currently shelters in
the occupied territories.
Over the few days that
the invasion was planned
beforethecurrentceasefire
was started, accusations
of human rights abuses,
and support of a useful
local force, the West has
also shown itself to be
an unreliable ally, and it
is unlikely to find willing
partners in the future.
Additionally, the West has
once more betrayed the
Kurdish people to their
fate, as in the aftermath
of the First Gulf War and
the 1991 Kurdish uprising
against Saddam Hussein.
Turkey has been proved
to be a poor ally for the
West. Its cooperation on
Russia in purchasing the
S400 missile system, its
threats against the EU to
release refugees should
the EU condemn its Syrian
invasion and Erdogan’s
confessed ambitions for
nuclear weapons raise sig-
nificant questions for the
other members of NATO
as to whether Turkey is a
suitable member.
