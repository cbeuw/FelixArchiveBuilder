T
hree thieves all
with different
motivations try
to break into a
gallery to steal a famous
painting. As they work
their way through the
gallery, they unknow-
ingly affect each other’s
progress before finally
meeting. Of course only
one of them can actually
end up with the painting...
The play begins
strongly. A penny dropped
from a rooftop to judge a
drop hits another thief’s
head who flips it to make
a decision. The coin drops
down a gutter and is found
by the third thief crawling
through the sewers.
This is an exceptional
sequence, and probably
the best moment in the
play. So why did the play
as a whole feel so dull?
Art Heist often feels
like a victim of its success.
With a sell-out run at the
Edinburgh Fringe and per-
formances at various fes-
tivals during the summer,
it could have been a stand
out amongst the innu-
merous post-Fringe plays
coming down to London
to capitalise on their 5-star
reviews. (The thinking
goes that no Londoner
wants to see experimental
theatre, but whack an
EdFringe Review sticker
on the programme and
Bob’s your uncle.)
The problem is one
of hubris. The cast and
writers, utterly convinced
of their own hilarity and
with a month’s worth of
in-jokes, start cutting up
the script, chopping and
adding till the original
narrative can only peek
out from between the
newly added nonsense.
What was intended to
be a challenging comedy
that forces the audience
to look inside themselves
by exploring themes like
art, capitalism, friendship,
and reality became a
cross between a summer
comedy starring Simon
Pegg and a game of
Dungeons and Dragons.
The solid jokes are buried
between fatuous add-ons
like “maybe what the play
is really about is labels” or
“art, when you really get
down to it, is just lines on
a canvas”.
There are clever
moments and some gen-
uinely innovative dram-
atography; all action is
directed by and setting is
provided from a desk next
to the stage by someone
doing the sound effects
and occasionally acting
as the gallery guard. What
the guard says defines
what is happening on
stage. Characters ask what
they can see and are told
where to go. Although
a clever technique, the
play repeatedly breaks its
own rules, frustrating and
confusing the audience.
Maybe the whole play
is a game the guard is
playing? Or a dream?
Nobody knows!
In the end everyone
starts being nice to each
other. It isn’t a good
ending.
This is the sort of play
you should watch. It is
challenging and fresh
with incredible staging. It
just doesn’t always make
sense, nor does the end
feel too soon.
Moving to Mars
S
pace travel and
design go hand
in immaculately
engineered glove.
Rockets and rovers, space
stations and satellites, the
unique environmental
challenges that extra-ter-
restrial exploration must
solve are fascinating. The
exhibition, “Moving to
Mars,” is the engrossing
result of the human aspi-
ration to find just what’s
out there beyond our little
blue blob.
The exhibition covers
it all. Starting off with the
Mars and the expectation
that we would discover
life there.
However, these
theories of Martian canals
were evaporated by the
extraordinary machines
that mankind has built and
flown to this distant rock.
ESA’s ExoMars rover
occupiescentrestage,with
a mobile version wan-
dering round the Design
Museum foyer. One of
the most staggering parts
of the exhibition was the
massive screens featuring
photos from the Curiosity
Rover. Stitched together
hi-res images give you the
disconcerting feeling that
you’re looking at a rather
desolate place on earth as
opposed to the desolate,
alien, Martian soil of
actuality. The images are,
frankly, breathtaking and
worth going to see on
their own.
The rest of the exhibi-
tion is firmly focused on
future Martian missions.
Videos of SpaceX’s
Falcon 9’s launching
and landing are perhaps
worth seeing if you
haven’t already watched
the videos a hundred
times before. I really did
enjoy the section on the
habitation of Mars, but
I’ve always been a sucker
for miniatures. The only
detractions of this exhi-
bition were the bits and
pieces of stupid art. Art is
not design, and it certainly
wasn’t good enough to fit
in with some of the actual
design work present in the
exhibition.
The whole purpose of
this exhibition is not to
show what is possible, but
whether it is at all nec-
essary. Moving to Mars
is presented as a feasible
next step for humanity,
we only need to decide
whether we should go. It
left one with the rather
profound feeling of what
if... And the disappoint-
ment that I’ll be dead
before I can hop on the
next rocket out of here.
Art Heist is challenging, innovative, exciting, and fresh. Such a pity that it isn’t that fun.

“The stitched
together
images of Mars
are frankly
breathtaking”
ancient obsession with
the Red Planet, it moves
on to looking at Mars in
pop culture and literature.
Other than the obligatory
Bowie, “Life on Mars”
CD, there some rather
funny comics and books
on show that certainly
were inspired by the
revelations of canals on
