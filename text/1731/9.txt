refers to property owned
and controlled by a group
as a whole, whether that
be by the community (via
common ownership) or
by a specific subset of the
society (for example, the
workers at an office). This
is an alternative to private
ownership and what some
would consider to be a
more just and democratic
model of ownership.
So what is there to stop
us from owning our
workplaces collectively?
You guessed it, private
property rights.
For one person to own
large swathes of land
and buildings that they
personally do not use,
and thus retain exclu-
sive access and control
of them, their private
property rights need to be
enforced. These rights are
legislated for by the state,
providing the enforcement
necessary for these rights.
The ownership of the cap-
italist is asserted through
statist institutions, like
the police, the courts,
and through prisons. In

ast week we
looked at wage
labour and the
class divide,
where we assessed the
capitalist class to be the
minority that owns the
means of production, such
as land, a factory, or an
office, and the working
class to be the majority
that are made to sell their
labour power in exchange
for a wage and use the
means of production to
produce wealth for the
capitalist.

Under this definition, the
vast majority of us own
no private property; we
only have our personal
property, and our ability
to perform labour.
There is a third form of
property, which applies
to property considered
too large or impractical
for a single person or
family to realistically
use. This form is called
collective property and

practice, the enforcement
of these rights is done
through violence.
If a group of workers
were to assert ownership
and control over their
workplace on the basis
that it is used primar-
ily by them, then this
movement would quickly
be squashed by the police.
If the workers were to
occupy and resist against
the police, they would
be met with violence
at the hand of the state.
Therein lies the cost of
private property rights:
the requirement of statist
violence to enforce them.
This state violence
can be easily seen when
we look at squatting: the
practice of occupying
empty homes owned
by landlords so that
rough sleepers can have
somewhere to stay. In
London, there are more
than enough empty homes
to house all those sleeping
on the streets, yet they stay
empty due to the practice
of landlordism: owning
a house that you don’t
intend to live in, for the
purposes of renting it out
or for housing speculation.
When squatters occupy
these empty homes to
provide rough sleepers
with shelter, the state
enforces the landlord’s
private property rights by
sending in the police to
violently evict them from
the premises. Even when
the house is being utilised
fully by legal tenants, the
landlord is making money
by doing little to no work,
due to the tenants provid-
ing a large part of their
wages to the landlord in
the form of rent. In this

economists like Milton

ably of private property
rights as the fullest

“the only way in which
you can be free to bring
your knowledge to bear
in your particular way
is by controlling your
property”, other econo-
mists like Karl Marx drew
an arguably more useful
distinction between the
idea of ‘private’ property
and ‘personal’ property.
Private property is defined
as property that is unused
by the owner and used
to generate wealth out
of other people’s labour,
with personal property
referring to property that
is used personally by the
owner. This distinction
lays bare the difference
between owning multiple
houses for rent, versus
owning your own house
that you live in. The dif-
ference between owning
