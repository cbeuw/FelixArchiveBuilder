The Space Problem
mperial has a space
problem.
This is something
thathasbeencovered
a couple of times this
year in the paper – notably
in the first issue’s Blackett
refurb article, when we
discussed the physics
department’s approach
to creating space and the
difference in its approach
to other departments (i.e.
those that have packed
up and left for pastures
green in White City, or are
planning to in future).
This week, we touched
on it again with regards to
the new counselling space
in Bernard Sunley.
For those of you who
areunaware:theCollegeis
straining at the seams and
is desperate to expand.
Overall student numbers
have increased year-by-
year in every department
with the space to do so,
and there have been heavy
funding rounds made via
the Advancement depart-
ment for constructing new
buildings at White City
– notably the J-IDEA, Sir
Michael Uren, and the
School of Public Health
buildings, each of which
have been mentioned in
Felix in some capacity
already this year.
With the departure of
the chemistry department
to White City and the
revelation in the Blackett
refurb article that Michele
Dougherty, head of the
physics department, was
asked to consider the
logistics of a move to
White City upon taking
up office, it’s clear that
this is a prerogative for
the College. They have
and will continue to invest
a fortune into their new
campus.
The sale of St. Mary’s,
accompanied by promises
of expanded facilities,
such as a medic’s gym,
likely at Charing Cross,
are further evidence of
the College’s drive to
centralise the medical
school’s various disparate
facilities.
The result of this
initiative is written on the
wall. Imperial is on its
way to becoming a ful-
ly-fledged multi-campus
university.
This is not a clearly
stated directive yet. It’s
merely implied. However,
the transient nature of the
student population and the
glacial pace of progress,
make spotting changes in
the running of the college
very difficult. Without
any sort of institutional
memory, students even
only a couple of years
apart can have wildly dif-
ferent experiences, with
both of them believing
that their experience was
the ‘norm’. The shift,
however, is occurring and
I think very few of us have
truly mulled over what it
means.
I think a lot of us will
have mixed feelings about
this. Word around the
Felix office is that this
sucks.
Sure, there are numer-
ous tangible benefits – the
ability to cheaply expand
laboratory and student
spaces to provide better
facilities for world-class
research and teaching
is not to be sniffed at.
To remain a world-class
institution, Imperial must
move in this direction.
South Kensington simply
cannot accommodate the
university’s ambitions –
there is no more space on
campus, and continuously
optimising the existing
space can only take the
College so far. Nearby
property comes at a
premium – although the
fact that Bernard Sunley,
a former second year ac-
commodation block, has
been left empty for four
years beggars belief.
But we do lose some-
thing in the process –
something valuable that
should be mourned. We
lose a bit of the Imperial
community. Yes, yes – it
sounds like a joke. “Im-
perial sucks”, I can hear
you cry out sarcastically,
“what community is there
to lose?”
Well, actually, a pretty
significant one. Being
crammed into this tiny
campus together is, I
believe, a very significant
reason why – counterin-
tuitively to the popular
griping – there exists such
a strong student commu-
nity. We have some of the
highest student election
turnouts in the country;
we have one of, if not the,
highest number of student
societies in the UK, many
of them run by ridiculous-
ly dedicated members.
Constituent Union teams
put in ungodly hours on
top of their degrees. The
568 Union bar staff have
their own internal com-
munity to get each other
through long nights – and
a thousand other organi-
sations and study groups
and campaigns and initia-
tives exist. We’re actually
a highly engaged student
body.
In the end, we may all
agree that being at Impe-
rial is a bit rubbish – but
that collective whinging
unites us. Our pessimism
ties us together.
That will die with the
multi-campus approach
– the student body will
fragment, no longer
unified by the ability to
mutually complain about
those things which affect
us all. At the moment, the
library flooding screws us
all over. In a few decades,
it’ll only be a small con-
tingent. They will develop
their own internal jokes
about it, but that will be
meaningless to those on
the other side of London.
I wouldn’t be surprised
to see a resulting decline
in, for example, the elec-
tion turnouts – after all,
why vote for somebody
who you will never inter-
act with and with whom
you share nothing in
common? Their problems
are no longer your own.
And, with that comes the
breaking of a community
which, let’s face it, is
mostly unified by Meme-
perial and IC Exposed/
Secrets.
We see this already
with the separation of the
medics. They have their
own jokes and experienc-
es, their own clubs and
societies, even their own
bar in Reynolds. This
self-imposed exile sepa-
rates them from the rest of
the student body. I don’t
wish to cast aspersions,
that’s just the nature of the
beast when the require-
ments of the medicine
course are so different to
most degrees. My point is
that it would be a shame
for this fragmentation to
further splinter the student
body.
I worry that unless
we as a student body say
something, the College
isn’t going to give a damn.
