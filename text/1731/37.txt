A
mumps out-
break that
originated in
the medical
school has within two
days spread to the rest of
the student body. College
sports teams have been
particularly badly affect-
ed, owing to how much
neck on neck action there
is between team members.
Darts player Gaaron Auha
told NegaFelix “I went to
greet my pal with our cus-
tomary neck bump and by
the time I noticed his one
was swollen to the size of
a monk’s bollock it was
too late”. Sports’ Nights
at the Union have been
poorly attended as sports
players struggling to get
through the doorways to
the Union gave up and
went home.
A union spokesman has
responded strongly to ac-
cusations that permissive-
ness surrounding vaccina-
tions was the cause of the
recent mumps epidemic.
Darlene Jewel Smith-
Smith (Vice-Provost
- Little Pricks) affirmed
that it was College policy
that all undergraduates
were expected to have had
their vaccinations. She
stressed, however, that the
last thing she wanted to do
was to force anyone to do
something that they didn’t
want. “After all, what if
one of them drops out as a
result afterwards. It would
put the College in dire
financial straits. They are
already barely managing
to pay my salary”
Rugby player Geoff
Thompson explained
that the reason that he
hadn’t had his MMR
jab was that his parents
had been worried about
him contracting autism
from the vaccination. He
revealed, however, that
the prospect no longer
worried him and he would
definitely vaccinate his
own children. “How bad
can autism be if the people
I play with are defined as
neurotypical?”
Fears of the mumps
outbreak are causing non-
sports playing students to
avoid their more athletic
peers. Feb Senton, third
year IEI explained “I used
to struggle to avoid sports
players but now it’s easy.
Just look for the people
wearing big scarfs or
40-inch necks and walk
the other way”. Sources
in RSM have admitted
that they are worried by
this division between the
sporty and non-sporty
students as they fear it
may result in lower marks
all over the board. “If
the football players can’t
get close enough to copy
answers from their more
capable course mates then
we are in real trouble”
