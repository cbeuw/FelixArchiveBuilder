Binge of the Week: Good Omens
A fluttery angel and an eccentric demon become unlikely besties, and together they save the world from the
apocalypse.
T
erry Pratchett and
Neil Gaiman’s
1990 fantasy
novel Good
Omens was once deemed
“unfilmable” given its
absurdity but now it has
been brought on screen
as a six-part miniseries
co-produced by Amazon
Studios and BBC Studios.
Good Omens proves to be
a faithful adaptation of
Pratchett and Gaiman’s
work, building on the
fascinating premise and
retaining its whimsical
humour on screen. It takes
a comedic turn on the
mythology of the birth of
an Antichrist and coming
of the end times, with an
angel and a demon lurking
around here and there.
The prophecy of an
apocalypse and Arma-
geddon, the final battle
between heaven and hell,
is about to come true
with the birth of Adam,
the son of Satan. Due to
some mishandlings in a
satanic convent, both the
angel Aziraphale (played
by Michael Sheen) and
demon Crowley (played
by David Tennant) have
lost track of Adam and
must team up to find
him and prevent the
Final Judgement. The
tale begins in the Garden
of Eden, transcending
history from Noah’s Ark
to French Revolution
to London Blitz in the
Second World War.

fraternising for centuries
on earth despite being on
opposite sides, has taken
a liking to mankind and
attempts to save the world.
Multiple subplots
complement the main sto-
ryline, and although out of
place at times, manage to
come together at the finale.
First and foremost is the
tale surrounding The Nice
and Accurate Prophecies
of Agnes Nutter, Witch,
starting from the burning
of Agnes Nutter herself in
the 17th century and her
descendants up until the
current witch Anathema
Device inheriting her
prophecies. The subplot
of Adam being mixed up
during his birth is interest-
ing to begin with, but the
scenes following Adam’s
upbringing appear to be
quite detached from the
main arc and comes across
as a little incoherent and
unrealistic. The part con-
cerning the summoning of
the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse, although ex-
cellent all by themselves,
do not fit into the overall
palette of Good Omens.
This brings me to my
main problem with the
plot. Although all scenes
are beautifully crafted
out, they lack an inherent
coherence. Additionally,
certain subplots often pale
in comparison to the main
narrative and could have
been fleshed out better.
All in all, while the story
remains delightfully en-
tertaining, it leaves a little
something to be desired.
For any TV show, the
production set serves a
crucial role in bringing
the story to life. It is no
different in Good Omens,
especially given the range
it covers historically and
geographically. Thanks
to the way the scenes are
framed, an angel and a
demon never feel out of
place, as they simply hang
around in different corners
of London, be it in Shake-
speare’s Globe Theatre or
Aziraphale’s bookshop or
St. James’s Park. But what
really drew my attention
is the way heaven and
hell are depicted, with
heaven taking the form
of a modernised office in
a skyscraper, while hell
being a crowded basement
lot where the sun never
shines. This portrayal is
one I never thought about,
but it comes across as
surprisingly accurate and
theme-fitting. Creative
takes are especially
necessary for the fantasy
genre, and Good Omens
has definitely gone above
and beyond in this arena.
All characters in Good
Omens are wonderfully
crafted and cast, especial-
ly for the leads Aziraphale
and Crowley. The angel
Aziraphale is an adorable,
soft-spoken angel whom
one cannot help but love,
and the same goes for
Crowley who is equally
charming despite being a
chaotic, tempting demon.
Sheen captures the
essence of Aziraphale’s
personality perfectly, like
a puff of fluffy cotton
candy, and Tennant’s
“Like a puff of
fluffy cotton
candy“
acting is absolutely on
point and could not have
been a better fit as the
sarcastic demon that is
Crowley. The chemistry
between the two definitely
makes the show, and any
scenes with them are
simply golden.
From the moment I
clicked on the trailer
and heard Queen and
David Bowie’s “Under
Pressure”, I had high
expectations for Good
Omens’s soundtrack,
and it did not disap-
point. Every scene with
Crowley features Queen
in the background, be it
“Bohemian Rhapsody”
as he picks up the son of
Satan for the baby-swap
bringing life to the lyrics
“Beelzebub has a devil put
aside for me”, or “Another
One Bites the Dust” as
Crowley falls into his own
trap, or “We Will Rock
You” as he drives his
flaming Bentley. Queen’s
rebellious, unique, bor-
derline-devilish music
fits Crowley’s edge and
swagger. Who knew Good
Omens and Queen were a
match made in heaven?
All in all, I probably
can’t help myself but
continue to rewatch Good
“The duo
has been
fraternising for
centuries“
Omens every now and
then just for Aziraphale
and Crowley’s incandes-
cent chemistry. (Plus,
it’s a lot of fun spotting
Sherlock easter eggs.)
While the narrative could
have been stronger, Sheen
and Tennant’s chemistry
is all the reason you need
to watch this intoxicating,
quirky, binge-worthy
series.
