Decimal man still CRUSHing it after over four years
F
loating Points is a
man with a PhD
from UCL. Now,
I wouldn’t want to
set the bar TOO high but
FP’s friend Dan Snaith,
a.k.a. Caribou, a.k.a.
Daphni, has a PhD from
Imperial, as does Brian
May. Looking at musi-
cians with doctorates from
the most (un?)prestigious
London universities, that
is an elite crowd. Does
Sam Shepherd stack up?
I mean, hair-wise he has
neither the aggressively
balding forehead of Snaith
nor the luscious foliage of
May. So what is he then?
Are his beats any good?
Does Imperial’s newspa-
per rate his new album,
Crush?
Unsurprisingly, for
a man whose academic
background is in neuro-
science, FP’s music is
very cerebral. The beats
have a jazzy vibe to
them, and despite being
dense and layered retain
a feet-moving verve.
This has always been the
case. It is the melodies
which are a departure
on his newest effort. On
his previous LP, 2015’s
Elaenia, they were subtle,
drawn out, and built up
over a span of minutes. He
had a whole band to round
out the delicate electronic
sound: guitars, strings,
percussion... This time
around he goes it alone.
The first track on the
album immediately links
us to the symphonic depth
that we’re used to hearing
from the nerdy producer
who named himself after
non-integers. By the
halfway point of ‘Falaise’
the flutes, brass, and
strings are mingling with
a synth overdosing on
grossbeat, and the album
never looks back. ‘Last
Bloom’ picks up with
some nice glitchy arpeg-
gios panning from ear to
ear, as well as some very
crushing beats, but never
takes it above second
gear. The ambient sound
continues in the next
track, ‘Anasickmodular’,
after which another or-
chestral piece, hilariously
titled ‘Requiem for CS70
and Strings’, prepares us
for the meat of the album.
‘Karakul’, which a
google search tells me
is the name of an Uzbek
sheep breed, acts as the
bassy platter on which
the highlight of the
album is served. The
melodically roaming,
kick-stomping, deep bass
driven ‘LesAlpx’ opens
with two elements which
follow the entirety of
the track. There is the
one-note bassline and, at
the end of the phrase, a
little telephone beep of a
flourish. They are joined
by a relentless four to the
floor and very curt closed
hats. Finally, some deep-
cave-sounding synths pan
in and out to round out
the aura of being a hawk
on an intense flight over
some very tall mountains.
The best feat of the song
is the way it completely
recedes at the midpoint,
before taking you by the
collar and marching you
to its conclusion.
The rest of the album
then tunes it down a notch
again, with some high-
lights of the mysterious
and atmospheric sound
including ‘Bias’, contain-
ing a bass that sounds
like it wants to hurt me,
and ‘Birth’, which sounds
like the synthy cousin of a
classical ballroom dance
piece.
So, Mr. biologist, what
comes after Birth? Well, it
all ends with ‘Apoptose’
in two parts, the so-called
programmed cell death
(he can’t help himself
with the weird science
flexing, can he?), placing
an exquisitely serene
nightcap on an excellent
album. You might be from
UCL, but we have to give
you this one…
Big riffs, small ideas: Foals are far too comfortable to
leave the stadium rock arena
E
arly this year, fol-
lowing four years
of relentless
touring, Oxford-
based indie quartet, Foals,
teased that they had a new
album ready. This was
not to be any ordinary
album, however, as they
had recorded simply too
much material for one
record, meaning it would
have to be released in two
editions, a sonic diptych,
Everything Not Saved
Will Be Lost, parts 1 and
2. Quite why they didn’t
opt for the conventional
double album format
wasn’t immediately clear,
but it now transpires that
rather than two sides of
the same coin, these two
pieces are thematically
and musically distinct.
Companions for sure, but
more Jekyll and Hyde
than Ant and Dec.
Part 1 brought the
biggest shift in their sound
since the move from the
jangly and staccato Anti-
dotes to the funk-inflected
introspection of Total Life
Forever. Synth-laden and
expansive, we saw a band
revitalised with fresh cre-
ativity. It garnered them
a Mercury Prize nomina-
tion, and set expectations
high for the sequel. The
second act of their apoc-
alyptic play, however,
feels all too familiar.
Rather than continue with
This isn’t to say it’s a
bad album – far from it
in fact – just that the pro-
gression from, say, ‘Snake
Oil’ to ‘Black Bull’ or ‘A
Knife In The Ocean’ to
‘Into the Surf’ feels a bit
too linear. Less of an evo-
lution, more a rehashing
with added fuzz. There
are undeniable delights
though: in the menacing
and brooding of ‘10,000
Feet’ and ten-minute
closing jam ‘Neptune’ we
see them deftly navigating
cavernous soundscapes,
interspersed with huge
crescendos, and awash
with obscure and evoca-
tive lyrics. They serve as
a contemplative reprise to
the brash and raucous first
side.
With its meaty riffs and
howling vocals, Part 2 is
made for big, high-octane
shows.And it makes sense
– Foals have, deservedly
so, earned themselves a
reputation as one of the
best live acts around, as
anyone who has seen
them will attest. While
they don’t really go in
for onstage theatrics, the
pure unbridled energy of
their performances keeps
the crowds flocking back.
It’s natural, therefore,
that they should seek to
distil that dynamism into
this record. In this age
of streaming, touring is
more than ever the sig-
nificant source of income
for artists, so you can’t
blame them. For many
fans though it’s unfortu-
nate that their new age
NME-bait stadium rock
comes at the expense of
the more nuanced, intri-
cate, Talking Heads-esque
quaintness for which they
were formally known and
