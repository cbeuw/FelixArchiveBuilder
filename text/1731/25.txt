Marriage Story: BFI Film Festival
W
hat I love
a b o u t
M a r r i a g e
Story. It’s a
great film, moving. The
writing is provoking and
rexal. It’s a film that’s
honest, really honest. It
makes you cry. It makes
you laugh. It’s very clear
about what it wants to
portray. It is excellent.
If this introduction
seems a little strange to
you, it will soon become
apparent from the be-
ginning moments of this
film, where we open
with two heart-warming
monologues from our
protagonists followed by
a startling yet hilarious
realisation. With its UK
premiere at the BFI Film
Festival, Marriage Story
follows actress Nicole
(Scarlett Johannson)
and her stage-director
husband, Charlie (Adam
Driver), through their
messy divorce split
between L.A and New
York.
After quietly building
a catalogue of films over
the last 15 years, Noah
Baumbach has built a
reputation on excellent
and authentic dialogue,
and this is no different,
with Marriage Story his
best work since Frances
Ha. Like many Noah
Baumbach stories, this
film is heavily centred
around the characters
and the relationships they
have with each other on
screen, with Driver and
Johansson both giving
their best performances to
date.
Much like The Squid
and the Whale this is a
film focused around a
divorce, however, almost
15 years from his original
break-out film, Baumbach
has manged to kindle a
different perspective on
the tangled affair and
comes at it from a vastly
different angle. Where
we previously saw the
divorce through the eyes
of an acting-out and
troublesome teenage son,
we now see it from the
parent’s perspective, with
next-to no embellishment
on the details.
What makes this film
both devastating yet
comedic is the head-on
nature that Baumbach
has tackled the story. We
get to see the initially
amicable divorce begin
to turn more and more
sour as the couple trade
blows in petty arguments
and subtle digs, all while
vying for their son’s time.
The comedy comes from
both the situation and
the dialogue, with both
parties recognising the
absurdity of the situation
that they find themselves
in. It’s a story that show-
cases the breaking down
of a relationship, and
then the transformation
that follows, as both
parties learn more about
themselves and their lost
love than they ever knew
while they were together.
This transformation of the
character’s relationship
takes centre stage and
we’re left to see how they
discover what they find
most important as their
emotions are pushed to
the limit.
Driver and Johansson
really showcase their
talent here, with subtleties
in their performance that
elevate the characters to
the projection of what
Baumbach intended.
This is visualised in an
argument where a whole
spectrum of emotions
are shown in just one
sequence. This discussion
turned screaming match
shows minute details in
moments of levity amidst
anger that can only come
from deep understanding
of human relationships,
with the writing and
direction from Baumbach
cast brilliantly in the
performance of the actors.
At around the 100
minutes mark there comes
an onslaught of emotional
hits as the characters start
digging deep to take them
through the divorce, and
finding a growing puddle
at your feet by the end
wouldn’t be out of place.
This is Baumbach’s best
feature to date, and will
leave you with the strong-
est bittersweet taste your
palate has known.
Tammy and the T-Rex
T
wo years ago, a
friend of mine
first introduced
me to Tammy and
the T-Rex: “Dinosaurs?
Romance? On YouTube?”
I thought to myself. “This
is too good to be true”.It
was not.
We spent the next
hour and a half watching
Stewart Raffill’s incredi-
ble brainchild, a memory I
recall with great fondness.
The Citizen Kane of
dinosaur-romances – I
invite you to treat yourself
to this unique piece of
cinema. Written in a week
on the prompt of a shady
animatronic T-Rex owner:
“I don’t have a story, but
we have to start filming
within the month!” TATR
tells the story of star-
crossed lovers Michael
(Paul Walker) and Tammy
(Denise Richards), kept
apart only by Tammy’s
bitter, violent boyfriend
Billy who decides to teach
Michael a lesson roman
style: by locking him in a
lion enclosure.
One hospital kidnap-
ping and a raunchy (don’t
ask) brain transplant
later our protagonist
finds himself trapped in
the body of an anima-
tronic T-Rex. A moment
potent with emotion, fit
to lacerate the heart of
any hardened Game of
Thrones viewer, follows
as Michael watches his
own body, lying dead
on the laboratory table,
from behind the T-Rex’s
plastic eyes. The viewer
is best advised to consider
this moment of character
motivation when contem-
plating his later killing
sprees. If the characters
crushed to death under-
foot are too much to bear,
remember that Michael is
also an orphan raised by
his alcoholic uncle.
Initially, the amount
of murder Tammy’s
beloved T-Rex commits
inclined me to suggest
dinosaurs remain relegat-
ed to troublesome forces
of nature, or less, as in
Jurassic park (released
conspicuously less than a
year before TATR). Upon
further reflection, this
feels unfair. As a giant
T-Rex, Michael’s passion
is uninhibited by the
primitive Judeo-Christian
values which keep us in
perpetual servitude to
capitalism’s unjust and
oppressive overlords,
represented by the
manipulative, sleazy Dr
Wachenstein. Only when
our T-Rex-come-Casano-
va turns on its oppressor,
killing him (SPOILERS),
could Michael be liberated
and the means of produc-
tion that enslaved him be
used for liberation. TATR
works as a socio-political
commentary, subtly illus-
trating how capitalism (as
represented by our T-Rex)
can only lead to death
and suffering, calling
each and every viewer to
revolution.
If T-Rex killing sprees
aren’t so much your
thing, fear not: romance
abounds, as sparks fly
between astoundingly
famous leads Paul Walker
(Fast & Furious, She’s
All That) and Denise
Richards (Starship
Troopers, Charlie Sheen
Spouse). I can’t comment
on dialogue, having
watched an auto-translat-
ed Italian version of the
flick, but I can tell that
action trumps words here.
When Michael appears
at Tammy’s window,
a towering therapod,
he does not lament her
beauty, as in Romeo and
Juliet’s balcony scene.
He instead carries her off
and brings her flowers, a
gesture this reviewer con-
siders far more romantic.
This film scores on
every level, emotion,
action, deeper meaning.
The only thing for you to
do now is to watch it.
