“There is
no point in
just talking
a big game.
You have to
actually walk
the walk. This
is a great start
- but it's not
the end of
the road. We
have to keep
momentum”
March are very busy
times of year. Having the
staff to reach the 7 to 10
day goal in busy times
means having a lot of staff
with not enough to do at
other times.”
In considering the
possibility of interim staff
for busy periods, further
problems arise. Any
student could then form a
good relationship with a
counsellor that they could
not then speak to later –
which especially affects
PhD students who are at
the College year-round.
There are also problems
with training new staff
simply to have them leave
immediately afterwards,
as well as finding skilled
candidates who only want
short-term work.
The end result is that
the 7 to 10 day goal is an
“average” throughout the
year, with waiting times
rising and falling around
that benchmark.
The newly available
space could also po-
tentially accommodate
other wellbeing services
that need to expand. The
Disabilities Advisory
Service (DAS) is simi-
larly crammed into Sher-
field, with offices spread
across the 5th floor – and
entrances located right
outside lecture theatres,
which can make students
feel awkward to enter.
This potential is one
that inspires Rosie in
particular, who shared
a personal vision for a
bespoke ‘wellbeing hub’
for students. This would
house the Student Coun-
selling and Mental Health
Advice Service as well as
the DAS, along with other
provisions for students’
holistic wellness.
Hannah Bannister, the
Director for Student Ser-
vices, shared this view-
point: “I’d like a ‘student
centre’ bringing together
most of the non-depart-
mental services in one
place that students can
access – including the
services in my remit such
as the DAS, counselling,
and the careers service,
but also others such as
registry services. Students
should be able to come
with any question and get
an answer or see someone
quickly.”
However, a centralised
hub near South Kensing-
ton would not address
one of the core problems
still facing the counselling
service: the lack of an
office in White City – al-
though Hannah suggests
that should the White City
campus grow, hubs could
be included in both places.
Counselling have been
trying to find a space in
White City for around
seven years, but have
thus far only been offered
spaces that were unusable
or were eventually book-
marked for other uses.
Recent attempts began
approximately 2.5 years
ago, the first of which
ended in the space being
given to medicine – and
unfortunately,nothingwas
reserved for the service
when chemistry moved to
the campus. Successively,
new spaces were offered,
but each was turned down
due to the inappropriate
nature of the entrance.
Several had full glass
fronts and were adjacent
to academics’ offices and
work spaces or common
rooms for students – a
failure to acknowledge
the particular essential
needs of the counselling
service.
A similar problem has
arisen at Hammersmith
Hospital, which is a short
walk from White City.
Although counselling
has been offered there
for eight years, the area
outside the meeting room
has now been renovated
to feature working desks,
rendering the office unus-
able for counselling – it
will be shut down next
week. Although an alter-
native allocated space has
been identified for use five
days a week, it is outside
lecture theatres – and
needs to be completely
refurbished, meaning it
will not open until at least
the 6th of January.
The frustration at this
situation is pervasive
– however, it is out-
matched by the strong
sense of future potential
that is felt throughout the
service. There is no sense
of complacency. Instead,
there is a strong desire to
improve and grow further
to meet the needs of stu-
dents – and in particular
to engage in interlinked
initiatives with other
wellbeing services across
the College community.
Claire explained:
“The strength that the
student counselling and
mental health team have
at Imperial is that we are
an embedded, integrated
service – not an out-
sourced agency providing
it for the university. We
are embedded because we
are based at the College,
and integrated because we
talk to and work alongside
academic departments
and other support teams.
We have that holistic view
of the whole student ex-
perience and understand
the student journey – we
aren’t in a bubble, we are
linked in. I want to see
more such linkage.”
Currently, decisions
at the College are often
made in isolated “silos”
– for example, every
faculty addresses wellbe-
ing and mental health on a
separate basis, rather than
fully coordinating jointly,
which could lead to
across the College – as
Claire explained it, “we
want to have consistency
across the whole univer-
sity, so you know exactly
what support you have
access to regardless of
what department you are
in.” The group found that
broadly the provision is
equal across departments.
More essentially, it found
a lot of positive benefit to
meeting in person – and
so also plans to propose
setting up a network of
student support practition-
ers, where developments
and learning can be
shared, and recommen-
dations can be made that
can then be put before a
decision-making body
with a unified voice. This
is another step towards
the idea of “joined-up
thinking.”
The resulting feeling
is that this is just the first
step in a much broader
push for resource alloca-
tion to wellbeing services
– a vital change given
the College’s notoriously
low student satisfaction
scores. Hannah is already
pushing for consideration
of this:
“The College is
considering a proposed
Student Support Strategy
created in collaboration
with last year’s Union
Officer Trustees, which
will hopefully be signed
off next week as College
policy. One of the strands
in that is asking the
College to commit to
considering students and
student needs when plan-
ning discussions around
space, as the College is
fundamentally changing
toward a multi-campus
approach.”
As best summated by
Claire herself:
“The whole conversa-
tion around space is really
about value – it’s about the
priority we put on student
experience and their
mental wellness. What is
the value that Imperial is
placing on that; what are
they doing about it; what
space are they offering.
There is no point in just
talking a big game. You
have to actually walk the
talk. This is a great start
here – but it’s not the end
of the road. Let’s keep
moving forward, and keep
momentum in terms of
the big picture of student
support.”
