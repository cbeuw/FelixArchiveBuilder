RCSU Broadsheet Editor
S
orry, but your
favourite half
Dane, half
Hong-Kongese
Constituent Union
President is occupied with
a pile of “bruh” moments
this week, so the RCSU
Broadsheet editor has
hijacked the CU section.
For those of you who
haven’t heard of Broad-
sheet, it’s the RCSU’s
magazine that aims to
bring science, society
and the arts together.
With a long tradition of
being a pre-digital meme
service and anti-CGCU
propaganda machine, it
served as a campus news-
letter also too. In the last
decade or so, Broadsheet
has evolved into a pub-
lication that has become
more or less a science
communication outlet.
With the majority of us
overwhelmed by science
through our degrees, I
can understand why many
don’t care at all. After
all, the world of science
media is so oversaturated,
so when that upon taking
on the role of Broadsheet
publication is nothing. It’s
a soul crushing thought
that all that you’ve worked
for is ultimately meaning-
less and inconsequential.
What would make people
care? It has to start with
the content: Broadsheet
needs to be conscious
of the issues relevant
to students at Imperial.
There are many people
interested in writing, but
with the articles focused
and relatable to students,
there would be a greater
number of people actually
reading the magazine the
articles need to be relata-
ble to students to increase
readership.
As with any idea
conceived in one’s head,
there’s always concern
that when it translates
physically into the real
world, the detailed mas-
terplan is slowly abraded
away into something
altogether different alto-
gether. But that doesn’t
mean we shouldn’t try.
Our ‘Welcome to
Broadsheet’ event was
held this Monday, and
it was a success. With a
fabulous turn-out of eager
creatives, I’m excited for
the fresh new ideas they
will bring. It was a great
opportunity to meet those
interested in contribut-
ing by writing, editing,
illustration, design and
photography; we have
ramped up recruitment
and got together a great
team. We’re busy working
on the ﬁrst issue and will
be ready to be picked
up on campus in early
December!
That’s an insight into
my life, thanks for indulg-
ing me. There’ll be more
of that quality regular
stuff fromAlex next week,
don’t you worry.
