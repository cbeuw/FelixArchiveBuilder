Imperial’s surcharge on plant-based milks
SUSTAINABILITY
W
hile many
g r e e n
enthusiasts
celebrated
the rise in Imperial’s
coffee cup levy from 15p
to 25p this September,
there has been a new
surcharge that has gone
relatively unannounced.
Behold the new,
sneaky little 30p sur-
charge on plant-based
milks which has been
introduced across
Imperial food outlets.
Now, choosing plant-
based milk over the
dairy equivalent in your
hot drinks will become a
costlier affair.
But what does this
mean for the
environment?
With green ads con-
stantly reminding us to
reduce meat consump-
tion in order to save the
Earth, the environmental
benefits of swapping out
dairy products for plant-
based alternatives have
been sorely understated.
According to a study
by the University of
Oxford, the greenhouse
gas emissions from pro-
ducing a glass of dairy
milk is threefold that of
other non-dairy milks.
This can be attributed
to the loss of carbon
sinks when forests are
cleared to make way for
pastures, along with the
gargantuan volume of
methane produced from
livestock rearing (an
average of 70 to 120 kg
per cow per year to be
exact – yikes).
Higher greenhouse
gas emission rates in
turn accelerate the pace
of global warming,
which subject our
planet to more danger-
ous effects of climate
change. Moreover, dairy
production is more land
and water intensive
compared to the produc-
tion of other plant-based
milks, making it a triple
threat to the environment
and its scarce resources.
By making dairy
options cheaper than
plant-based ones, it is
safe to say that custom-
ers will be less keen
to reduce their dairy
intake, leading to further
fuelling of the ongoing
climate crisis.
Non-dairy milk op-
tions are also often
healthier
As much of the fat in
regular milk is saturat-
ed, the NHS has warned
that excess consumption
could potentially lead to
weight gain and raised
cholesterol levels,
putting one at increased
risk of heart attack and
stroke.
Milk also may contain
antibiotics (used by
farmers to prevent cows
from getting sick),
which may have an
adverse effect on gut
health, by damaging
good bacteria, and dis-
rupting the balance of
gut microbiome.
On the other hand,
plant-based milks
contain largely unsatu-
rated fats, is high in
fibre, is antibiotic-free,
and offer a plethora of
added health benefits
when fortified with
calcium and vitamins.
The environmental
impact of plant-based
milk varies
Though proving to
be far better alterna-
tives than the standard
dairy options, different
plant-based milks have
varying degrees of ef-
fectiveness in protecting
the Earth.
For instance, soybeans
and almonds grow in
conditions unlike those
in the UK, chalking up
hefty environmental
demerit points due to
fuel consumption from
their transportation.
At the same time, the
production of almond
milk is the most water-in-
tensive out of all other
plant-based milks, with
a single glass requiring
74 litres (more than the
typical shower!). Not far
behind, rice milk is the
second thirstiest on the
list, with a total of 54
litres of water used to
make one glass.
However, it must be
noted that these plant-
based alternatives are
still far superior to dairy
milk when comparing
different factors of envi-
ronmental friendliness.
Fighting to abolish

there could (and should)
be far more!
By taking less than a
minute of your time to
fill in her short survey
(accessed via the QR
code below), you too
can be a proponent for
a more plant-based
Imperial.
Even if you happen to
agree with the surcharge,
it would be great to type
in your responses so that
Francesca understands
where you are coming
from and can represent
you accurately.
In summary
With the thermostat
quickly dropping as
winter approaches, the
new charges imposed
could not have come at
a worse time as students
and staff turn to hot
drinks to warm up.
This 30p fee, though
numerically small, is a
big statement that shed
lights on the university’s
true attitude towards
sustainability.
As the school body,
our collective voice has
the power to champion
the fight for a healthier
planet. Let us act before
it is too late.

up to try and reverse
this absurd policy.
Environmental and
Ethics Officer ‘19/20,
Francesca Siracusa, has
spearheaded a campaign
to collect student and
staff perspectives on
the surcharge, hoping
to discuss the situation
with the relevant author-
ities as soon as possible.
Having enjoyed soy
and alternative milks
for free during her four
years at Imperial, Franc-
esca was surprised and
frustrated to hear of the
additional 30p charge.
Market research
findings all point to a
skyrocketing demand
for plant-based milk
in recent years as con-
sumers are developing
a better awareness of
their environmental and
health benefits. Thus,
Francesca believes that
the 30p surcharge could
negatively affect the
sales of campus food
outlets as people who do
not or cannot consume
dairy may reduce or
completely stop pur-
chasing hot drinks from
them.
Moreover, she
believes that this form
of tax disincentivises
people from making an
effort to reduce their
dairy consumption
and carbon footprint,
especially since 30p is a
disproportionately high
charge for the small
volume of plant-based
milk in one hot drink.
Your invaluable role
in this campaign
To ensure that views
of the Imperial body are
heard, Francesca has
created a quick survey
to gather perspectives
to present during
her meeting with the
Imperial catering lead-
ership team. As of today
(23rd October), there
have already been 288
responses – but Franc-
esca is optimistic that
