“Led Zeppelin
II highlights
the bands evo-
lving sound,
creeping from
the blues-
inspired first
album”
L
ed Zeppelin II
was formed out
of incessant
pressure from
their record label Atlantic
Records, who wanted to
ride on the hype of Led
Zeppelin’s first album,
Led Zeppelin, released
7 months beforehand in
March 1969. The im-
portant consequence of
this meant that recording
occurred throughout
the multiple ongoing
European and American
tours of the first album,
and ultimately gave the
album an urgent feel. This
insistent touring took its
toll on production: writing
would have to be squeezed
in between travelling that
morning and performing
that evening, often in
that night’s hotel room.
Recording wasn’t much
different, as sessions took
place in multiple studios
across London, LA, New
York, Memphis and ‘the
Hut’ in Vancouver, so
named because it was
poorly equipped but was
all that was available for
recording. Jimmy Page
eventually commented
that he was “really fed up
of it (the album). I’d just
heard it so many times in
so many places. I really
think I had lost confidence
in it.” Impressively, de-
spite the restricted time,
Led Zeppelin II highlights
the band’s evolving
sound, creeping from the
blues-inspired first album
to a heavier sound that also
hints at the more acoustic
direction they were to take
on subsequent releases.
The album breaks
open with the iconic riff
of ‘Whole Lotta Love’,
a staple of the Led Zepp
setlist, complete with
a swooning psyche-
delic middle section
lovingly referred to as
‘the freakout’. This was
a result of Page and
engineer Eddie Kramer
“flying around the room…
twiddling every knob
known to man” which
made a “technique” that
was extremely innovative
for its time. Other effects
were unintentional, in-
cluding a happy accident
involving Robert Plant’s
faded vocals towards the
end of the track, which
came about as a take bled
into the master vocal tape.
Instead of re-recording,
Page and Kramer added
extra effects to highlight
the sound. Plant’s vocals
on the entirety of this
record have noticeably
matured from their
previous album, as have
his lyrics. The second
song ‘What is and What
Should Never Be’ on
the album highlight this
more sophisticated lyrical
aspect, such as “And hap-
piness is what you need
so bad/girl, the answer
lies with you, yeah”.
Effects placed on Plant’s
vocals and again using the
‘twiddling knobs’ effect
from ‘Whole Lotta Love’
combined in an overtly
psychedelic noise.
Cracking open with
another classic Page riff,
‘The Lemon Song’swings
back to Led Zepp’s
blues-inspired roots.
Said to have improvised
the entire thing, bassist
John Paul Jones plays
a funked-up bassline,
earning the song a medal
just for it alone. The song
twists and turns, going
from its jazzy riff to a
Page guitar solo, into a
stripped back section to
allow the bassline to shine
through and finally into
an all-out rampage with
everyone giving it their
all. It’s just an incredible
song. After the slap of
that, the album settles
down next into a matured,
lighter sound with
‘Thank You’. This track
involved Page playing
both 12-string electric
and acoustic guitars, and
with Jones on an organ
this song truly steps back
from the classic Led Zepp
sound and ushers in the
ever-evolving noise they
will introduce more of
on their next album Led
Zeppelin III. Once again
Plant outdoes his former
self lyrically: “little drops
of rain whisper of the
pain/tears of loves lost
in the days gone by”. By
expressing his love for
his wife Maureen, Plant
gives the song a beautiful
poignant feel in true
ballad fashion.
Busting out of that
lovey nonsense, comes
‘Heartbreaker’, an abso-
lutely iconic Led Zepp
song, complete with an
infectious Page riff and
ostentatious lyrics from
Plant. “Hey fellas, have
you heard the news?/You
know that Annie’s back
in town?” instantly brings
the listener in as Plant’s
confidant, where we find
out what Annie has done
to Plant: “one thing I do
have on my mind, if you
can clarify please do/is
the way you call me by
another man’s name when
I’m trying to make love to
you”.
Naughty Annie. Plant’s
boasting but sad story
is overlaid with Jones’
bubbling bassline and
intertwined with many
showy Page solos (ap-
parently, this song was
written so Page could
show off his solo skills –
go figure). Interestingly,
if you listen closely you
can hear the difference
between guitar tones of
Page’s riff and solo – an
incontinuity due to record-
ing in a different studio
from where the rest was
recorded. Heartbreaker
flows straight into ‘Living
Loving Maid (She’s Just
a Woman)’, a classic rock
song which paved the way
for many more classic
rocks songs and majorly
influenced the hair metal
of the eighties. Whilst still
brilliant, this song lacks
the energy of Page’s other
riffs, perhaps indicating
his focus on making in-
tricate and elaborate riffs
and solos in other songs
on the album. ‘Ramble
on’ is an example of
the sort of thing Page
is focussing on instead;
again, the band promote
that acoustic noise they
will move towards but
with it comes the heavy
rock element, psychedelic
effects and another intense
Page riff. If one song were
to summarise the album,
it would be this one.
‘Moby Dick’ is a
break for Plant’s vocals
– the instrumental song
was added to showcase
drummer John Bonham’s
abilities and is a writhing,
building song which well
displays his capabilities.
The closing song, ‘Bring
it on Home’, starts off
with mysterious bluesy
harmonica before belting
into the typical Led Zepp
noise, accentuating the
band’s nod to their blues
route but ultimately
displaying how they
have already outgrown
themselves in one certain
genre. This song seems
to be their goodbye to
classic blues, before they
would shortly be defining
their own genres and
defying others. In short,
happy birthday to one of
the most influential rock
albums the genre has ever
seen.
Happy Birthday and congrats on still being relevant // Fonts In Use
