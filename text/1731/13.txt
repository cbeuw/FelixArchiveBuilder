This week, Grumpy Bastard puts phones on the hotseat.

N
o, you can’t
have my
number. Why?
Oh, that’s be-
cause I don’t have a phone.
Yes, that does make me a
better person than you.
Thanks for noticing! I’ve
actually been living life
without a phone for six
months now, and I’ve
really felt the benefits.
It’s not because I’m
scared that the Chinese
government are going to
comb through my dick
pics. In fact I welcome
the Paramount Leader’s
interest in my little
comrade. It’s not even
because I am afraid of
the imminent zuccing
I fear every time I drag
my eyes through the
pipeline of broken glass
that is my newsfeed. It’s
because I’m sick of the
cult of indulgence that
has sprung up around
consumer tech. Who
the FUCK needs three
cameras in one phone?
Who is taking three
selfies at once? Why not
just have one camera
that’s three times the
quality?
And while we’re at it,
who on Earth is paying
£1,000 for a glorified
brick? You’d be better
off walking around with
your PC in your back
pocket. Try putting a
screen protector on that.
What was wrong with
the audiojack? Not wa-
terproof enough? Stop
putting your phone in
water then, you fucking
bellend. You idiots are
paying hundreds for
solutions to problems
that you never had. Oh
great, a digital assistant
can make calls for you
now? It’s a phone,
fuckhead. It could do
that anyway.
You can piss off with
‘foldable’ phones, too.
I’d rather fold myself
into a plastic wallet and
jump into a laminator (I
hope Xi Jinping doesn’t
find those photos) than
attend a keynote. What’s
a fucking keynote,
anyway? A TedTalk for
how you’re going to
shaft consumers this
cycle? How fucking
arrogant. I wish Tim
Cook, or Mark Zucker-
berg, or Jeff Bezos, or
whichever human form
he’s appropriated this
time would just fuck off.
If anyone was going to
make the gilet any less
fashionable, of course it
was some horrible amal-
gamation of Pitbull and
a naked mole rat. Tim
Cook is just Steve Jobs
with less megapixels and
Sue Perkin’s haircut.
Is it too much to ask
for people to stop staring
at the fucking black
boxes in their hands
while crossing the road?
While holding a con-
versation? I’m shocked
Panopto doesn’t have a
live comments section.
Even if it is a cesspool
of human interaction, at
least I might see some
sort of participation in
a lecture. ‘Like this if
you’re confused lol.’
Just give me some sort
of meaningful human
connection, for fuck’s
sake.
Black Mirror was
right, we’ve all fucked
our attention spans
away. So if we’re going
to ruin ourselves with
a bit of dopamine, why
stop at Insta’s discovery
feed? Catch me next
year in my Pleasure
Dome™, with VR
deepfake porn streamed
24/7 into my dry and
bleached eyeballs, while
NHS-prescribed opiates
are funnelled into my
decaying, collapsed
veins. Don’t forget the
added Wank Master
3000™, which stimu-
lates my little comrade
to near constant climax.
Thankfully, I’ll never
have to leave the house
again with iFulfillment,
my newest compre-
hensive entertainment
package that tricks
my tired and decrepit
What is even the fucking point of them. // Apple

that I’m living a life
worth living.
