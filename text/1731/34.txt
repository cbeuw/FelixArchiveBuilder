have left.
A lot of uni and your
twenties is, I believe,
about trying to ﬁgure
yourself out. When
looking at myself I’ve
determined that I’m
some part sympathetic/
emotional and can be ri-
diculously compassionate
(I was welling up after re-
searching what happened
during the UoL 2013
Protests https://www.
channel4.com/news/
university-of-london-stu-
dent-protest-ban-sen-
ate-house-occupy), but I
also have a ridiculously
cold logical side. Overall,
I’m quick to judge but for-
tunately quicker to change
my opinion when it’s clear
someone is worth their
salt.
I think that University
is really an abusive lesson
in resilience. You gotta be
there for yourself and help
yourself. Imagine you’re
on a plane (Oh boy I love
running gags) and the
oxygen masks fall down in
a crisis – you are told and
probably will strap yours
on ﬁrst. You’ve got to
help yourself ﬁrst before
helping others. If you
become an incapacitated
wreck then what good
are you to your friends
- the same applies here.
An ex-MechEng legend
who failed ﬁrst-year
mechanics like 5 times
once told me: “I gotta stay
ﬁt and mentally robust,
otherwise I’m deadwood
to my friends when they
need me”.
Another thing that
narks me is some students’
fundamentalist mentality
of “A mental breakdown
proves you’re trying hard
enough” being modern
professionalism alongside
the seeming abundance of
intolerance at Uni… And
I’m certainly not the most
tolerant person. People
make mistakes, every
day. Boy, you should
have seen the typo_s that
were in this, or how hard
I shafted 2nd-year exams.
But people are not forgiv-
ing enough for the small
benign typos of an email,
or speech, and rush to take
offence.
Modern profession-
alism seems ﬁxated on
how to react, and act dif-
ferently around different
people. Again, I’m a bit
shite at this, as the Provost
found out when I called
him out the same as I
would anyone else. I don’t
really believe in changing
the way I talk depending
on the environment/ who
I’m talking to - a toddler,
a fresher, a good friend
or even Alice Gast. Why
change the way I am, I
value authenticity and
“knowing thyself” far
more. Another bugbear on
professionalism, to me it
means not holding petty
grudges when someone
forgot to say please or
was sharp on an email,
realising instead that they
have their own shit to
deal with and getting on
with it. Impersonally and
efﬁciently, they would be
the loveliest person over
coffee maybe but they
have stuff to do. Sadly for
some people they can’t
seem to put little things
aside and (with my rather
blunt northern emails) ﬁnd
myself repeatedly at the
bad end of sticks - despite
the fact that I am lovely
over coffee in a personal
setting. Just in the ofﬁce
I’m Mr multitasker. It is
however saddening that
in our modern age there
is the increased potential
for misunderstanding and
crossed wires in an email
(With 80% of those “all
comms” that are visual
disappearing)
Perhaps I’m being
marginally dismissive in
general, I just hope that
there are people out there
who want to read this kind
of mind-based bullshit
which comes with heavily
biased advice from a
real person. Not totally
unhinged but real. I started
off this piece roughly
with some talk of mental
wellbeing and psyche, and
it’s true; people talk to me
almost every day about
worries and problems – do
I offer something? I don’t
know. But I try to listen
where I can, reassuring
them that there is great
value in talking, because
there is. And it’s not even
about sharing something
of myself with them - it’s
about understanding.
Understanding is one
of the greatest things we
have as a species. And
being honest and open
too. This is why above
all else I value straight-
forward, down to earth
talk. Honest talk. – I hate
corporate-speak, such
as talk of “managing
expectations” or “starting
conversations”. As one of
my committee pointed out
after CSPB (Clubs Socie-
ties & Projects Board) that
kinda stuff is for “Goons
in a room” who never get
stuff done.
Naturally, it’s easy to
oppose, challenging to be
in power, and hard to ﬁx
stuff. Which makes my
criticisms of the system,
which I’ve tried to lay off
this week, easy to level.
But hell, we are trying
to put forward solutions.
And we will keep trying.
Accountability is the
stalwart position of an
engineer. You sign off
the plant, car, program
etc with your mark - and
are responsible for and
answerable for what you
do. In this way I hope
that you’ll always view
us as being too. Humans
are more questions than
answers. But please if
you have anything you
want to ask, then ask
me ask me ask me! My
committee, like me, are a
curious bunch of weirdos
and spend time thinking
– trying to make sense of
things. So why not pop by
CAGB 350 whenever you
got a question and ponder
with us. We’re always
open when the light’s on.
I’m going to close
again with parting words
of wisdom from my
ﬂatmate, commenting
that life isn’t all that bad
now for teenagers “When
our parents were younger
the music was better, and
you could buy a house,
everything else was bit
shite tbf.”

2:19 on a Monday,
12 Hours of
Lectures behind
(Sadly impres-
sive). Bev of choice while
composing this master-
piece: Thatchers Gold.
By the time this all
gets printed – if the copy
editors or ICU staff don’t
merk me - it’ll be the
end of a blissfully hellish
week, I’ll have designed a
jet plane (yay!), survived
another week of daily
emails and will be looking
forward to dining with
some of you at our Annual
Welcome Dinner on
Saturday (26th).
It’s been another inter-
estingweekfortheCGCU,
with the highlight thus
far being last week’s Pub
crawl. I’m slowly getting
my life together having
successfully cooked three
square meals on Monday,
which was navally ap-
propriate given that it
was Trafalgar Day. The
next step is getting back
into the gym #BigLAD.
Now onto the deep shite.
I think with this week’s
ramblings I am getting
at something, topics or
things you don’t really
discuss outside of therapy
or a late-night DMC with
your best mate. University
is a period of life in which
a lot of things happen,
some good, some bad,
regardless they all shape
your character to a greater
or lesser extent. The sum
of my experience so far is
that I am in a better place
now than I was previously,
despite the various shitty
aspects of the past couples
of years and the scars they
