T
he College has
expanded the
space available
to the Student
Counselling and Mental
Health Advice Service,
by renovating space
in the old unoccupied
Bernard Sunley hall in
Evelyn Gardens. The
new space opened on
7th October.
The budget for the
expansion was around
£150,000, which was used
to convert and furnish five
rooms in the building into
counselling spaces – as
well as a reception and a
waiting room for students,
a necessity which had
been missing at the ser-
vice’s South Kensington
location in the Sherfield
Building.
The new rooms will
be used by three full-
time counsellors hired
by the service last year,
for whom there was
job – previously, we were
offered resources but not
the space, so we couldn’t
give a meaningful offer-
ing from that.”
Rosie Summerhayes,
the head of the service,
said that the goal has
always been to see stu-
dents within 7-10 working
days of referral – but that
the lack of space has made
that impossible, with the
average wait time climb-
ing from 8.2 working days
in 2014-15 to 23.0 days in
2018-19.
Alongside the expan-
sion, the service is also
trialling a new system
for conducting the first
assessment; we want to
encourage students to start
a conversation about what
is troubling them and be
heard, and then we can
suggest the right support
for them.”
The new system has
received positive feed-
back so far, with students
reportedly preferring to be
seen quicker to develop an
initial action plan than to
wait for a longer session
– but it will be assessed
throughout the year based
on student feedback.
Shervin Sabeghi,
the Deputy President
(Welfare) of the Union,
was involved in hiring the
new counsellors over the
summer. He commented
that he is “confident that it
will result in far fewer stu-
dents getting stuck in the
system and not receiving
the support they need.”
“I plan to keep up-
to-date with how these
changes affect waiting
times and the student ex-
perience with the service
throughout the year – so
it’s important for students
to give feedback.”
The space has been
praised as being a major
improvement, by Shervin
as well as the counsellors.
Although concerns have
been raised about the dis-
tance to Evelyn Gardens –
a 20 minute walk from the
South Kensington campus
– Rosie believes this can
be a positive.
“It gives students time
to think about what they
want to talk about on the
way here, and time to
decompress on their way
back. Counselling is not
always a joyous experi-
ence – it can be upsetting
or disturbing. You need
space between yourself
and the rest of the world.”
Asimilar benefit is offered
by the new waiting room.
She feels that this is
emphasised when con-
sidering other wellbeing
provisions, such as in
departments: “you can’t
just flip back to being a
functioning student upon
opening the door. You
need to go to a different
space, talk about it, and
then you leave it behind
– rather than it being
contained in your depart-
ment.”
There is an essential
importance to the feeling
and particularly the
entrance to a counselling
building. Both Rosie and
Claire stressed the need
for it to be discrete, safe,
and professional – for
students to feel like they
can share freely and to
feel able to contain any
problems they have to that
space. This was, in fact,
the primary consideration
when new venues were
being considered over the
past several years – both
in South Kensington and
at other campuses such as
White City or Hammer-
smith Hospital.
The new space caters
well to this, being placed
off-site. There are,
however, downsides –
other than the distance,
which may become a
problem during exam
time. The budget for the
renovation ran out before
all available rooms could
be refitted, meaning that
there are several available
rooms which are still
empty. This is despite the
fact that the old hall has
been vacant for four years.
This leaves a lot of
room for future expansion,
which is useful as Rosie
foresees the need for
eventual growth to twelve
counsellors in order to
tackle the load during the
busiest times of year.
Year on year, there is
incremental growth on
the number of students
utilising counselling –
growth far above that of
the overall student pop-
ulation. The number of
students confirming and
attending appointments
has risen by anywhere
from 11% to 22.1% each
successive year for a total
increase of 76.2% since
2014-15, as compared
to a total student popu-
lation growth of 19.2%
in the same time frame.
Already, the service feels
that it is “outgrowing”
the space, as there is an
evident need to expand
the Mental Health Advice
team. However, the tran-
sient nature of the student
populace poses challenges
in this regard.

College Counselling Service Expansion: A First Step
The College has invested into expanding the student counselling service after they had struggled to keep up with
demand for several years - but this is just the beginning

meeting with students,
dubbed the ‘initial con-
versation’. By cutting the
length of these meetings
to 30 minutes instead of
50, while still ensuring
the initial conversations
take place with an experi-
enced counsellor, students
are now being seen much
earlier than they previous-
ly would have.
Claire expanded on
this: “I am sure that any of
us would be glad to have
an initial conversation
with a specialist – it’s
much better than waiting
several weeks only to find
that counselling isn't the
right solution. It’s a triage
