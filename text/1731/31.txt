Poll Results
Question 3: Favourite Starter
Froakie, surprisingly, was the most common answer! Although unsurprisingly Torchic and Charmander were runner-ups.
Question 4: Most Disturing Pokemon
Spoink bounces around on its tail. The shock of its bouncing makes its heart pump. This Pokémon cannot afford to stop bouncing – if it stops, its heart will stop.
Question 4: Most Disturing Pokemon
Almost everybody said Team Rocket was their favourite team, a classic to be sure both in the games and the anime. Shoutout to team skull with 2 votes though, yo!
