hree weeks into
the new term
and guess who
was already
fed up of work and
wanting to get away for
the weekend? Why, 15
of Imperial’s ﬁnest and
freshest triathletes, that’s
who. On Friday 19th
October, we packed our
bikes (remembering to
remove our pedals, don’t
want any scratches!) and
made the quest to Kent.
Having braved the rush
hour trafﬁc of London
on a Friday evening, we
arrived in the converted
barn that was to become
our weekend home, eager
and ready for a weekend
of cycling, running and
swimming. Parking the
vans was an interesting
challenge when our tour
sec decided that we can’t
hurt a single blade of grass
and so decided to help the
grass back on its feet.
On Saturday, we woke
to glorious sunshine and
promises of a phenom-
enal day. With copious
amounts of porridge, toast
and bananas having been
devoured, everyone was
out on their bikes and
discovering the garden
of England. Splitting into
three groups encompass-
ing all from beginners
to ironman athletes, the
distances ranged from 40
to 70km with no triathlete
being left behind. Chatting
on our bikes and meeting
new people, everyone was
enjoying ignorant bliss,
unaware of the dangers

that lay ahead. It all
started with one puncture,
then another, and before
we knew it, there was a
total of eight ﬂats! Having
stopped many times
to ﬁx these punctures,
resulting in us all getting
cold, a compulsory cafe
stop in Canterbury was
in order where we were
able to investigate the
cakes of Kent. The carrot
cakes and ﬂapjacks did
not disappoint! Having
returned from our bike
rides, (with the fast group
returning after the slow
squad), we ventured to the
coast where people went
running or walking, or sat
on the beach trying to do
coursework enjoying the
glorious view of the sea.
Some brave athletes kept
true to the three-sport
nature of the club and
decided that a swim in
the bracingly cold waters
would be a good idea.
This provided great enter-
tainment for the (perhaps
more sensible) crew
remaining on the shore, so
it was a win all round.
The sun was slowly
setting, and we returned
to our house where supper
was cooked and an old
triathlon triathlon of pass-
the-parcel was introduced
to our new members.
Instead of a prize at the
end, the lucky winner
was given a variety of
challenges, ranging from
the physically impressive
to the downright ridicu-
lous. Particular highlights
included a hilarious series
of karaoke duets - the sight
of our glorious captain
serenading the freshers is
enough to make anyone
want to join the triathlon
club.
off on rides ranging from
40 to 100km. The tyre
troubles of the previous
day had spawned a sweep-
stake, but thankfully the
puncture fairy was kinder:
only three ﬂats occurred
that day. This was perhaps
a little dubious, given that
those who had bet three
were the ones who had
the punctures! Having
returned again from
our bike rides, a group
decided it wasn’t enough
and sneaked in a cheeky
run before we packed up
the house and drove back
to London. Upon arriving
back in London, everyone
was already missing the
greenery of the Kentish
countryside and looking
forward to the next tour.
Those who missed out on
the fun should make sure
to get their triathlon mem-
bership in so they can
join us on our upcoming
Easter extravaganza!

The next day, we
woke early and ready for
another epic day of adven-
tures. Having experienced
so many punctures a
sweepstake began for the
number of punctures that
would occur that day.
