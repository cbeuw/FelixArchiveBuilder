Members of ICXCAC return to Parliament, and they
mean business

Leaves are turning
brown, leaves are fallilng
down, weather turns
chilly and the the fields are
getting muddy - it’s time
for some Cross-Country.
Last year, Imperial’s
Cross-Country teams
absolutely dominated
the field, winning the
Women’s league with the
Men’s team coming in
second place behind the
notorious St Mary’s team,
and the club won the Mike
Baggs Trophy, which
takes into account the
performance of the club in
general throughout the 5
races - a glorious season.
Instead of resting on
their laurels, the squad
has been training hard
since then and didn’t
lay off training over the
summer. With one goal
in mind, and led by a
determined committee,
51 sturdy athletes rocked
up to Parliament Hill last
Wednesday to show the
rest of London that they
weren’t going to give their
opponents any slack.
I... C... X... C...
I..C..X..C..I,C,X,C,ICX-
C,ICXC! The crowd goes
wild, the gun goes off, the
pack leaves the starting
line and storms off and up
the hill. The much-cov-
eted “King of the Hill”
award went to Imperial’s
Silvio Barandun after an
admirable sprint up the
first hill - for those unfa-
miliar with this award, it
is the ultimate honour in
LCLs, the knighthood of
Cross-Country one would
say: the fastest up the steep
hill, appropriately named
“The Climb” on Strava
at the very beginning of
the hill, with a long race
ahead of themselves, wins
said award - absolute
legend. Having won this
first honour, the Imperial
athletes kept their focus
and settled into their
pace as they faced strong
opponents from across
London, especially from
Saint Mary’s for both the
Men and the Women, and
Brunel and UCL for the
Women as well.
Stellar performances
this day saw the Women’s
team top the podium:
fresher Laura Wright
came second, seconds
behind Brunel’s Tessa
Mc Cormick, followed
by Women’s Captain
Georgia Curry in bronze.
Also in the top 10 were
strong returning athletes
Chloe Baker and Alix
Vermeulen, just a second
apart in 7th and 8th place.
With such great running,
the A team secured their
first place, with a strong
24-point lead over Saint
Mary’s in 2nd place. Im-
pressive running from the
B Team, led home by trail
enthusiast Lea Adamson
in 16th place, Stephanie
Hewitt in 23rd place, Lara
Sterritt in 28th place and
Minty Hampden-Martin
in 34th place - accumulat-
ing 503 points and sitting
in a strong 6th position.
this season! Next from
Imperial was Daniel
Mulryan in 4th place
and Club Captain Henry
Hart in 6th place, in a
Saint-Mary’s - Imperial
sandwich, making for a
very competitive atmos-
phere between the two
clubs. Completing the A
Team were Niki Faulkner
and Oliver Newton in
29:44 and 30:02 in 12th
and 13th place - rapid per-
formancesinacompetitive
field, this earnt the team a
worthy second place in
the Team rankings with
968 points, just 11 behind
rivals Saint Mary’s - this
race for gold is far from
over! The Men’s B team
meanwhile also put in
valiant efforts that payed
off with Misy Ormay
coming 15th, Tom Bayley
17th, James Krasucki
19th, Joe Pomfret 21st
and Leo Maisonobe 22nd,
racking up 911 points and
coming in an outstanding
3rd place, in front of
Saint Mary’s B Team and
all other universities’ A
Teams!
The day ended with
some celebratory bak-
ing-binge as the team
was doing so well and
currently tied first with
Saint Mary’s for the Mike
Baggs trophy that they
will seek to defend this
year. Later in the evening,
the runners headed to
Miran Masala for a
celebratory curry and to
Oyster Rooms and Slug
(what is this Redback
thing people keep refer-
ring to?) for celebration
drinks and a classy little
boogie. The team is now
looking forward to the
next fixture in Mitcham
Common this coming
Wednesday.
