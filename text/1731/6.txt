A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week Felix spoke to the Deputy President (Finance and Services), Fifi Henry, about all things food – 568, hbar,
Fusion, and Reynolds.
Felix: Firstly, Fusion.
Do you have input
into College deci-
sions about on-cam-
pus food?
FH: Generally yes – they
will check with me if
they think there might be
backlash from students
to check on my thoughts.
So I’ve spoken with
College catering about
the takeover of Fusion, as
well as the visual revamp
of Reynolds.
Felix: So why is the
College taking over
Fusion?
FH: Because taking over
means the cost can go
down – any profits can
be reinvested, rather than
taken away from the
College. So, for example,
the ‘mix and match’ box
will be going down from
£4.50 to £3.95, and a new
meal deal for £3.50, which
is a pound cheaper. I’ve
been assured that these
priceswon’tchangeforthe
foreseeable future. People
are a big fan of the food
in Fusion, so the College
wants to keep that same
offering while making it
cheaper and better quality.
We’re doing food tasting
sessions – which Felix is
invited to – to confirm that
students are happy, too.
Felix: If the College
can offer cheaper and
better alternatives,
why do they ever
lease out to outlets
like NeoPizza?
FH: Well, sometimes
they can. It depends on
the food offering. The
lease for Fusion was
coming to an end, so the
College re-evaluated the
viability of taking over
that service and realised
they could do it better.
However, for other outlets
like NeoPizza or Kimiko
in the JCR, that capacity
may not be there – for
example, Kimiko have
high buying power due to
buying in bulk, whereas
the College doesn’t sell
that food elsewhere and so
would be buying smaller
amounts which is more
expensive. That means
they wouldn’t be able to
operate it cheaper, and
there’s just no reason to
if they have to increase
prices and operate on a
loss.
Felix: Tell us a bit
more about the
changes in Reynolds?
FH: It was one of the
first things I worked on
when I came into office in
August! They wanted to
rebrand slightly – they’ve
repainted surfaces and
put new vinyls in the
window, which looks a lot
nicer than the old peeling
stickers. I talked with
Ben, the ICSMSU Pres-
ident, about the changes
as well, which was nice.
They’ve also updated
their food and drink menu
– Reynolds operates a bit
like h-bar used to, with
a Union bar side and a
College-run food side.
The student experience
survey showed students
wanted more branded
items, so they’ve included
Starbucks, as well as
looking into offering hot
food like jacket potatoes
and pastries.
Felix: Speaking of
h-bar, what’s hap-
pening with the food
service there? Was it
not meant to begin
before term started?
FH: For context, the
College decided last year
to cut their late night tapas
food service, which ran
from 7pm until shortly
before closing, and the
Union began talks with
the College to take it
over from 7pm onwards.
Plans were set up, and we
conducted food-tasting
