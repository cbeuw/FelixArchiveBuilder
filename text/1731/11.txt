On a street corner,
waste bins have been
set alight, the noxious
smell of burnt plastic
penetrating the air. The
piercing siren of a police
van shatters the silence
of the night as it speeds
onto the scene. Running
towards the van, a group
of hooded people begin
hurling rocks, debris and
anything else to hand. The
van door flings open and
riot police leap onto the
pavement and start chas-
ing. The people scatter as
rapidly as they appeared,
they flee in all directions
and disappear into the
shadows cast by roaring
flames of the burning
waste.
Thishasbeenacommon
scene in Catalonia over
the last few days. The
recent events broke out on
14th of October when the
Spanish Supreme Court
sentenced nine former
leaders of the Catalan
independence movement
to up to 13 years of prison.
They were found guilty
of sedition and misuse of
public funds.
That day a pro-inde-
pendence crowd blocked
access to the airport of
Barcelona, where more
than 100 flights were to
be cancelled as the crews
couldn’t arrive to their
workstations.
Since then, many
peaceful mass protests
have taken place, with
over 500,000 people
attending the Marxes per
la Llibertat (Marchs for
Freedom) in central Bar-
celona last Friday. Many
Catalonia after several
days of marching, causing
the closing of several
highways and roads.
However, among them
are around 2000 violent
masked youths that clash
with police forces every
night. Since the beginning
of the protests, more than
200 of them have been
arrested, including 100
that have already been
brought to justice. Ac-
cording to official reports,
one quarter of them have
been sent to prison on
the basis that because
the demonstrations are
ongoing, their probability
of reoffending is high.

case of an arrested citizen
accused of throwing a
firework cracker at a
Catalan police helicopter.

Context
These events are only
the latest developments
in the Catalonian Inde-
pendence movement that
has hundreds of years of
history. The most recent
peak episodes of the
movement occurred in
October 2017 when an
illegal referendum was
held, followed by a dec-
laration of independence
from the President of Cat-
alonia Carles Puigdemont
and its approval by the
Catalan parliament, which
is controlled by separatist
parties.
A judge ordered the de-
tention of the movement
leaders, but some of
them, like Puigdemont,
had already fled Spain.
The arrested leaders were
charged with rebellion
by a public prosecutor,
who accused them of
promoting the violence
during protests, especially
the ones that occured
right before and during
the illegal referendum.
Moreover, they were
charged with embezzle-
ment for using public
funds to finance a banned
vote.
Ultimately, the judge
has just found them guilty
of sedition, which is a
similar crime to rebellion
in that it promotes the
subversion of the estab-
lished order, but is not as
grave because the level of
violence is smaller.
However, rather than
writing an end for this
long story, this seems to
become just one more
episode of the long dispute
between Spain. We will
keep an eye on the next
occurrences.
protests started weeks
ago, in anticipation of the
Supreme Court’s expected
guilty verdict, not only
by the independence
movement but also by
the Spanish Home Office,
who in the last month
has sent more than 1000
additional policemen to
Catalonia.
The situation is also
having a great effect in
national politics, as there
will be general elections
in one month, and all the
parties want to show their
own solutions for the
conflict, while taking the
most out of these situation
for winning some more
votes.
The President of the
Government of Spain,
Pedro Sánchez, has
critiqued them for their
lack of support to the
Prison sentences of up to 13 years handed down to Catalan leaders have brought people back to the streets
of these demonstrators
had arrived from all over
Government in such a
serious situation. He has
also confirmed that the
Council of Ministers will
not approve an indult for
the inprisoned leaders,
and has rejected applying
extraordinary measures to
cool down the situation
in Catalonia, as the more
conservative parties have
claimed.
