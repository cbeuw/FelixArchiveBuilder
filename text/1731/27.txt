T
his weekend I
had the opportu-
nity to go to the
gaming conven-
tion EGX to scope the
latest and hottest games
- courtesy of press tickets
#GamesEditorPrivilege
#ApplyNow. The event
was phenomenal, al-
though its position at the
distant ExCeL (Royal
Victoria Dock) was less
so. While the journey
to the convention took
about an hour, the jour-
ney back took two and a
half, courtesy of signal
issues on the central line.
Putting my journey woes
aside, the convention held
some of the most antici-
pated upcoming games,
including: Cyberpunk
2077, Pokémon Sword
and Shield, Final Fantasy
VII remake and numerous
other triple-A hits. Not
to forget the absolute
onslaught of Indie good-
ness available to play and
enjoy: Hollow Knight
Silk Song, Untitled Goose
Game and Castle Crashers
Remastered.
So, what did I actually
manage to get my hands
on? Whelp, due to my
lateness as a result
of commute delays I
couldn’t try out as many
games as I would have
liked. With every Triple-A
game having a minimum
of a 30-minute wait,
Avenger’s was one of the
worst offenders with a
2 hour wait queue. With
what limited time I had
left I managed to play
RuneTerra, Dragon Ball
Kakarot and Final Fantasy
VII remake (the most
devastating of queues).
So, starting off with
RuneTerra, the game’s
visual aesthetic was on
point giving the same
glitz and glamour as its
base material - League of
Legends. The atmosphere
and dialogue between
cards added soul to the
game as well as lore and
immersion. The gameplay
despite being slower than
most typical card games
was interesting, however,
it does seem to be a Jack
of All Trades (master of
none) with respect to com-
bining various features
from other card games
i.e. Magic the Gathering,
Hearthstone. Gameplay
was (as you would expect)
back and forth, every turn
the offensive and defen-
sive sides were switched
alongside every action
the player makes, pro-
viding their opponent the
opportunity to use/place
down a card. Overall, I
have a strong feeling that
RuneTerra will deﬁnitely
be able to compete against
Hearthstone; alongside
Riot’s backing it may
“RuneTerra
will definitely
be able to
compete
against
Hearthstone”
“EGX definitely
has something
for any type of
Gamers”
even come out on top! I
also got the chance to play
the Perfect Cell boss ﬁght
in DB Kakarot, which in
my opinion was one of the
best ﬁghts in the Dragon
Ball game series in
terms of mechanics. My
reasoning behind this is
that the ﬁght actually felt
both strategic and bullet
hell-esque whilst retaining
the original DB ﬁghting
game style, with there
being proper boss phases
as well as interesting
abilities and movements;
in other words I cannot
wait to get my hands
on a copy of the game
purely for its gameplay!
Final Fantasy VII remake
left me enamoured by its
visuals, it was like I was
playing Advent children
but in game form, the
gameplay felt like FFVII
combined with FFXIV,
when casting an ability
time is slowed drastically
to the point where it was
borderline frozen (Za
Warudo!), limit break is
still available, surpris-
ingly they took FFXIII’s
staggering mechanic and
incorporated it into the
game. When asking other
people how they felt about
the movement mechanics,
they stated that it felt
slightly clunky, similar
to that of Uncharted,
here’s hoping that doesn’t
become a point of frus-
tration when playing the
game.
In terms of indie games
the show ﬂoor was bounti-
ful and amongst it all what
really caught my eye was
the section dedicated to
the new Streets of Rage 4
as well as Windjammers
2. Now, these games may
not be on everyone’s top
10 anticipated games
list, but for me it’s clear
that these games are the
epitome of the Switch’s
intention, simple games
with greater depth that
you would love to pick
up with a friend whilst
on the go. Windjammers
2, featured fun gameplay
with even more enjoyable
strats and tactics, whilst
Streets of Rage 4’s visual
appealed to my love of
side scrolling beat-‘em-
ups alongside the ability
to dish out my pent-up
coursework frustration on
random assailants. Other
games that I wanted to
play included Hollow
Knight the Silk Song, but
my desires were stiﬂed by
extremely long queues.
Whilst journeying
through the masses of
crowds I also visited the
tabletop section, which
was in my opinion, a
table-topper’s dream with
numerous games set up
and free for anyone to sit
down, play and have a
laugh. As expected of the
area there were tabletop
merchants as well, some-
thing I was particularly
happy about given that I
was able to get the entire
Dark Souls Card Game
collection including the
new expansion for £50
- an absolute steal in my
book given the price of the
base game alone. Other
areas of the convention
included the ﬁght zone,
where a ﬁghting compe-
tition for Street Fighter V
was held, and it deﬁnitely
had a lot of gusto and
ﬁghting spirit given my
ability to hear the crowd
shout and cheer from
across the room. Retro
zone was a vintage fan’s
dream with a massive
selection of games to
play with almost every
console you can imagine
being there, except for the
commodore 64 - damn I
really wanted to play as-
teroids on something that
can’t even run MSPaint.
And last but not least at
the end of my journey I
settled down and watched
some of the speedrunners,
the one I enjoyed the
most being Spark The
Electric Jester 2 played
by Argick, my heart goes
out to him for providing
engaging commentary
whilst dealing with some
bullshit moments in the
run. All in all, EGX is
deﬁnitely something for
Gamers of any type, may
that be table-toppers, in-
die-lovers, retro maniacs
and of course the Triple-A
hordes.
