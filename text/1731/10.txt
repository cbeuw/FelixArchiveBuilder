It quickly moves from
an economic question to a
philosophical one to argue
whether the idea of private
property rights is a just
one or not. If the capitalist
owns the private property
in accordance with the
law, why wouldn’t it be
just for those rights to be
enforced?
If you were to ask a cap-
italist where they got their
private property from,
they’d say that they either
inherited it or bought it
from someone else. In
this sense, their right to
own the private property
comes from what used to
be somebody else’s right,
which then transferred
to them legally through
inheritance or trade.
Thus, the legitimisation
of private property rights
rest on the legitimisation
of those who used to own
the property before them.
If you were to examine
how the previous owners
came to own the property,
they’d also say that it was
passed on to them through
inheritance or trade. Trace
this line long enough,

and you will end up at a
point where the rights to
the property were won
through violence, such as
through war and conquest.
And even prior to this
phase of property being
owned by those with the
mightiest armies, the very
conception of private
there was no private
property. All land was
held in common, used
by all through a natural
principle of free access. In
the UK, it was only until
the process of enclosure,
where the common land
was siphoned off and
entitled to aristocrats and
landlords through legal
acts passed by the Crown,
that this land ceased to be
available to the commons.
In this way private
property rights are de-
pendent on the state both
historically in terms of
enclosure, and in modern
times through legislation
and the continuation of
the threat of state violence
in order to enforce them.
One widely used defi-
nition of the state is: a
centralised organisation
that wields a monopoly
on the use of violence
within certain borders. If
you own private property,
the state is there to use
its institutions such as
the police and military
to enforce those property
rights.
This is how modern
private property rights can
be traced all the way back
to medieval times, with
legitimacy of these rights
resting on the perceived
legitimacy of enclosure
and conquest. If we
believe that the monarchy
is an unjust system, and
that it is not legitimate to
take something by violent
force (a.k.a. theft), then
to generate profits off
the workers’ labour.
All property would be
owned either personally,
for one’s own personal
use, or collectively, with
their fellow workers,
tenants, or the commu-
nity. Capitalism rests on
the class system, which
in turn rests upon the
enforcement of private
property rights, which
in turn rests on the state.
Therefore, the existence
of a state is a require-
ment for capitalism.
Without private property
rights, the class system
would collapse and
so would capitalism,
ushering in an economic
system where the means
of production are held
socially under collective
ownership: this alterna-
tive system is referred to
as socialism.
That is the fundamen-
tal difference underlying
the two opposing
economic systems: who
owns and controls the
means of production? Is
it an elite minority, or
is it everyone? Markets
also play an important
role in capitalism, and
the perceived effective-
ness of distribution of a
market-based economy is
why many would consider
capitalism to be the most
successful economic
system that we could ever
have, despite the author-
itarian underpinnings of
such a system.
Markets will be
covered in a future instal-
ment of this series, but
next week we will have a
look at the state. We have
already introduced the
idea of a state and briefly
discussed its role in en-
forcing private property
rights; however, there
is a lot more to discuss
regarding how it is used
to prop up capitalism both
domestically and globally.

“Therefore,
the existence
of a state is a
requirement
for capitalism”
that results in the collapse
of the moral argument for
private property.
If private property were
no longer a thing, then
the capitalist class could
no longer restrict access
and control of the means
of production, and thus
could no longer operate
the wage labour system
property had to first come
into existence: go back far
enough and there were no
states, no police, and no
armies to enforce private
property rights, and thus
“Therein
lies the cost
of private
property
rights: the
requirement of
statist violence
to enforce
them”
