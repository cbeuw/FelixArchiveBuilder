A
fter a stunning
defeat of Bra-
senose Col-
lege, Oxford
at University Challenge
this week, the Imperial
College team have been
welcomed home as
revered champions, but
their newfound admira-
tion didn’t just stop with
a few congratulations
– within days, they have
become unlikely sex
symbols for the student
body.
Arriving back in Sher-
field the after filming,
the team was met with a
cheering crowd of stu-
dents and staff in Queen’s
Lawn, swarms of people
chanting their names and
sporting “We Love Quiz”
banners and life-size
cardboard cutouts of the
quartet. “It was absolutely
crazy,” commented May
Johnson, a second year
Biochemist who was part
of the crowd, “people
were screaming the entire
time, I even saw a few girls
throw their underwear at
them.” There were more
than just a few. When the
crowds finally cleared,
cleaning services reported
over 2 sets of panties, and
8 pairs of boxers left on
scene.
“It’s all a little over-
whelming”, the heartthrob
team members Meely
McMeel, Dick Rich,
Rando Brandon, and Del
Brooks told NegaFelix,
“we’re extremely flattered
by the attention but it’s
been difficult to get around
now.” Rando Brandon
elaborated, “I was biking
home that night and a
bunch of students were
chasing after me. And I
don’t cycle very fast so
they were basically just
following me home.”
On Wednesday, a
pop-up shop selling
Dream Team merchandise
was set up in Sherfield,
selling body pillows,
printed bed sheets and
pillow cases, and old
tissues used by members
of the team (kindly pro-
vided by their flatmates).
Lines for the pop-up shop
reportedly circled out
the building and around
Queen’s Tower, the
life-size posters of their
chiselled physiques sold
out online within 3 hours.
The craze hasn’t
died down for days and
doesn’t look to be calming
anytime soon. The team
has become the talk of
the town. “I saw Dick
Rich wearing a Jackwills
hoodie and flip flops, so I
bought a Jackwills hoodie
and flip flops,” said
Charles Litmus, a fourth
year chemist. Someone
else told us, “one time, he
punched me in face. It was
Look at these hunks and their sexy curves. (I really admire you guys)// Wikimedia
awesome.”
“I’ve come such a long
way from my Quizlamic
State days,” professed
Del Brooks, “I’m trying
so hard not to let the fame
get to my head.”
NegaFelix reports that
an estimated 5 students
will be dressing up as
them for Halloween.
And though on the
surface it seemed like the
Team was enjoying their
surging popularity, Meely
McMeel reveals his
struggles with the darker
side of fame, “All people
see when they look at us
is our hunky features, but
what about our brains?”
“Cleaning
services
reported
over 2 sets of
panties, and 8
pairs of boxers
left on the
scene”
