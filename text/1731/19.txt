Felix: So when did this
all start?
RJ: Still pretty recently
actually. I only really
got into it during my gap
year. That’s when I did
my Walland Hill EP, just
before going travelling.
But I hadn’t really done
any music until January
this year.
Felix: Really? Ever?
RJ: So, I used to produce
drum and bass stuff, like
3 years ago. But ‘Waiting
for Something’ in January
was the first song as Roy
Juxon. I didn’t really tell
anyone about it, just tried
to plug it to a few random
people and they kinda
liked it so I decided to
keep trying stuff out. My
first proper public track
was ‘Self-reflection’. That
was the first one I let my
friends hear.
Felix: I find it interest-
ing that ‘Waiting for
Something’ was your
first track because
I think a lot people
would just be messing
about with their very
first song to see what
works, but it’s actually
got quite a deep
theme to it – was there
something specific that
inspired it?
RJ: It was kind of inspired
by this bridge outside
the David Lloyd I was
working at at the time.
People said someone had
committed suicide by
jumping off it. It’s kind of
about the thought process
about wanting to jump
and then jumping, and
“waiting for something”
as in waiting for some-
thing good to happen.
Felix: So where did you
grow up? And what did
you listen to growing
up?
RJ: I’m from Exeter,
down south. I’ve always
done classical music – like
opera stuff. I didn’t really
listen to that stuff though.
I had my Eminem phase
and then I went through
90s and 00s hip hop.
Then I started listening to
more alternative stuff and
grunge. It was Swimming
by Mac Miller that made
me fall back in love with
hip hop, and I just went
through the modern
greats after that – J.Cole,
Kendrick.
Felix: I feel like that
album hinted at him
finally being able to
“I just want
whatever I
put out out
to be of a
professional
standard”
cope with stuff. And
that was just so tragi-
cally juxtaposed by his
death.
RJ: That’s part of why it’s
become so iconic. Like
the last song, ‘So It Goes’,
he’s like saying people die
and it’s just whatever. And
then literally a month later
that happens.
Felix: We’ve had a lot
of deaths in hip hop
recently. Especially of
rappers whose music
is very personal for
fans – Peep, XXX, Mac.
Do many artists have a
personal impact on you
that inspires your style?
RJ: At the moment, I’m
very much just starting
out. Like, ‘Confusion’ is
the first song I’ve put on
Spotify. So I’m still just
trying to find my style.
In terms of influence,
whenever I find a new
artist or am listening to a
song and really like it, I
just try and do a song in
a similar style to that. So
something like ‘START’
– have you listened to that
one?
Felix: Yeah, it’s very
Jaden Smith.
RJ: Yeah, very Jaden
Smith and also Travis
Scott. I liked that bit with
that synth scale run kind
of thing in ‘Butterfly
Effect’ so I tried to just
put that in, and also take
inspiration from his use of
autotune.
Felix: Sodoyouhandle
your own production
then?
RJ: No, I generally go
out to external producers,
mainly because I know
how time consuming it can
be to produce a track. My
thinking is that I just want
to get some momentum
right now, actually get
tracks out. Then once I’ve
got that, maybe I can begin
to focus on doing more of
my own production.
Felix: What’s your song
writing method like?
RJ: I always start with the
chorus, I’m only really
motivated to work on a
verse once I have a catchy
chorus. And then from the
chorus I go to theme, and
then the theme leads to
me freestyling a verse just
to get a flow. And then
once I have the flow, I just
re-write the verse with the
lyrics that I want.
Felix: Tell me a bit
about Walland Hill EP.
RJ: So, my old house
was called Walland Hill.
Moving was quite melan-
cholic and I wanted to put
together a concise project
that reflected on that
time in my life. ‘Hours’
and ‘Summer She Said’
are about my girlfriend,
‘Self Reflection’ is kind
of about not wanting to
waste away my life in
a 9-5 and then ‘Lost a
Friend’is about how while
studying I sometimes tend
to lose my creative side
and wanting to get back in
touch with it.
Felix: Would you ever
consider working on a
complete album?
RJ: Not for the time being,
I’d only do that if I had
the opportunity to work
on it full time. I’m quite
enjoying singles for the
time being. It means I
can enjoy the excitement
of releasing regularly.
And they’re all their own
entity, so that lets me get a
bit of variety.
Felix: Are you kind of
settled into a routine
now with balancing uni
and music, or do you
tend to question which
path is more important
to you?
RJ: I think if I could do
it full time and sustain it,
I would. I quite like the
balance though. If there’s
ever a day where the
music isn’t very good, at
least I have maths, and
vice versa. And also, for
the time being, I am able
to successfully release a
single at least every one
or two months. Because in
the Summer I made a load
of songs that I can now
progressively release. I’ll
probably release a song
called ‘Out of Touch’
within the next six weeks.
I’ve got others that are
done too but I don’t think
they’re up to scratch for
me to release – I just want
whatever I put out to be of
a professional standard.
Check out Roy Juxon on
SoundCloud, his new
single ‘Confusion’ is out
now. He also has a gig in
London coming up at the
end of November!
