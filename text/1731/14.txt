Pretty fly for a sci-fi
B
ased on the
1961 book of
the same name
by Polish author
Stanisław Lem, Solaris
recounts the events that
occur on a research
station hovering in orbit
above the titular ocean
planet. Orbiting between
two stars, Solaris defies
scientific explanation, be-
having not as a planet but
more like a living being.
The book is about the
futility of humans trying
to communicate with or
understand alien beings.
The main drama of
the novel comes in the
form of the ‘visitors’,
haunting doppelgängers
drawn from the minds
of the researchers that
seem to originate from
Solaris itself. In the case
of the main character,
Kris Kelvin, a former
lover appears, torturing
different beast. Stripping
out a lot of the book’s
ambiguity, the play
reaches to the heart of
what Lem was aiming for
while also updating it for
a modern audience. What
was previously all very
high-concept becomes
more accessible, without
compromising on the
original vision.
In the novel the charac-
ters are hidden away, deep
in the psychological hell
caused by their visitor.The
play brings the crew (all,
bar Snow, gender flipped)
out of their rooms to argue
about the proper way to
respond to the nonsensical
constructs that Solaris has
sent them. While this may
be a theatrical necessity
to avoid long expositional
monologues, it does give
the characters a chance
to voice the hopes and
fears that the planet, and
the thought of wider alien
contact, inspire in them.
By making Kris’ (Polly
Frame) visitor the most
advanced, Dr Sartorius
(Jade Ogugua) and Dr
Snow (Fode Simbo)
become the voices of
humanity, shut out of
the cabin where Kris
sequesters herself with
Ray (Keegan Joyce). The
two colleagues are free to
worry about what it would
actually mean to make
contact with a truly alien
intelligence. Through this
dialogue, the story, once
regarded as Freudian
and anticommunist,
challenges the arrogance
that inspired efforts to
communicate with the
planet. While possibly the
clunkiest of the scenes, its
earnest message reaches
far beyond the words that
carry it.
The setting of the
narrative lends itself to
interesting set design with
a clean white spaceship
interior, parts of which
slide away to reveal beds,
cabin doors, and cassette
players. Charmingly
analogue, the play has its
astronauts research in the
library and smoke cigars.
While it could easily be
dismissed as quaint, and is
intentionally anachronis-
tic, the effect is to create
a chimera that has been
left behind in time. The
station and the scientists
on it have dedicated years
to studying a being that
has no interest in them
and may in fact only be
dreaming.
It is in the third quarter
that the play falters.
The planet, no longer
ways. One scene, in which
Kris’ visitor is on stage
alone, seems to commit
this version of ‘Solaris’
to one very specific in-
terpretation of the story.
Though a twist towards
the end challenges this
interpretation, the damage
is already done.
In the end, the tender
moments between Kris
and Ray stop the play
from becoming overly
cerebral, by grounding
it in Kris’ pain and hope,
and in Ray’s horror at dis-
covering his true nature.
By developing a simpler
romp out of a hugely
complicated text, Greig
and his director Matthew
Lutton have created some-
thing worth seeing.
Don’t Solar-miss this futuristic alien drama!
Cabin fever is bad enough without the arrival of alien doppelgängers // Mihaela Bodlovic

suicide. This terrifies him,
even as he begins a rela-
tionship with the clone
that acts and behaves like
the woman he has lost.
The play, adapted by
David Greig, is a very
“...the play
reaches to
the heart of
what Lem
was aiming
for while also
updating it
for a modern
audience.”

“Solaris...
is childlike,
learning to talk
to its visitors
step by step”
the amoral Lovecraftian
horror of the novel, is
unnecessarily anthro-
pomorphised. Solaris,
in Greig’s version, is
childlike, learning to talk
to its visitors step by step
before manifesting in
increasingly sophisticated
