ork bellies – yes,
the pork that
comes from the
belly of a pig, was
an iconic commodity for
the futures market’s rep-
resentationin pop-culture.
While it might be sur-
prising that the ﬁnancial
market involves pork
bellies, it made sense. The
bellies were frozen and set
A Story of Pork Belly:
even used pork bellies
to explain how a market
works in a 1983 ﬁlm titled
“Trading Places”. (See
Youtube: Trading Places
– Bookies). However, the
landscape of the business
changed when pork bellies
were consumed all year
round rather than being
a seasonal product. With
bacon accompanying
salads, hamburgers, and
even milkshakes (think
Five Guy’s free bacon
topping), it removed the
demand for frozen bellies.
In 2011, trading pork belly
futures came to an end on
the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) – it was
not a shock as the volume
of trades had shrunk to
almost nothing.
However, bacon is back
on the menu this year!
Why? McDonald’s
reported a 4.5% increase
in comparable store sales
in the ﬁrst quarter in part
due to bacon-related
promotions such as “Big
Mac Bacon” and “Quarter
Pounder Bacon”. Bacon
was ranked #3 (behind
shellﬁsh and barbeque)
in the National Restau-
rant Association’s 2018

in price and supply.
An overview of com-
modities trading and a
brief history
Pork bellies are an exam-
ple of the commodities
that can be traded on
exchanges. Commodities
are split into two types:
hard and soft commodi-
ties.
Hard commodities
are typically natural
resources that must be
mined or extracted such
as gold and oil; whereas
soft commodities are
agricultural products or
livestock such as corn,
wheat, soybeans and
pork bellies.
Trading commodities
have been a long-running
business – from seashells
or indirectly, simply
because of the shipment
of products (from where
it is manufactured to the
shelves). Furthermore,
oil price is always a
discussion point between
politicians.
In addition, commodi-
ties are often the most
signiﬁcant exports of de-
veloping countries, and
revenues obtained from
them have an important
effect on the economies
and living standards
in these countries. For
example, many countries
in Africa derive more
than 90% of their export
earnings from commodi-
ties.
How does commodities
market work?
Investors can gain
exposure to commodities
indirectly by investing
in companies that rely
on commodity prices
or through the purchase
of mutual funds. Direct
exposure to commodities
would be buying into a
futures contract. This is
known as paper trading.
Commodities can also be
traded physically – com-
panies secure a supply

by the growing populari-
ty and the price volatility
as seen in Figure 1, in
May 2019 CME began
to publish a new Fresh
Bacon Index to provide
a transparent weekly
price to those across the
bacon supply chain, for a
better understanding on
the market dynamics of
bacon that is sold in the
cash market.
You may wonder why
the wholesale prices of
pork bellies ﬂuctuate
so much? Think about
the supply chain and the
wider economic factors:

Something interesting
to think about. The
commodities market is

rose. Therefore, consum-
ers hedged against inﬂa-
tion by locking the price
of the belly through the
use of a futures contract
(a contract for assets
bought at agreed prices
but delivered and paid for
later). Pork belly futures
reached its peak of popu-
larity in the early 1980s.

to the general public
after being referenced in
magazines and movies –

to spices, the ancient civ-
ilisations saw the ability
to create and manage
complex trading systems
and facilitate commodity
exchange as a form of
economic development.
Throughout the years,
the basic economic
principles of supply and
demand behind trading
commodities have not
changed: disruptions in
the supply chain, such
as livestock-related
diseases, is likely to lead
to a spike in the usually
stable and predictable
demand; technological
advances also often have
signiﬁcant inﬂuences on
prices.
What makes commodi-
ties trading interesting is
its strong connection with
the economic landscape.
Often it is described as
the “invisible hand” that
moves the market. The
most straightforward
example is oil – many
consumers only think
about oil prices in the
context of how it directly
impacts their wallets; in
other words, how much
they will end up paying
at the pump as the result
of price ﬂuctuations.
However, the price of
oil can potentially affect
many companies, directly
