T
here has been
an outbreak of
mumps among
medic students
over the last week, ren-
dering several students
confined to their homes
while they wait for the
infection to pass.
The NHS recommen-
dation for isolation is
five days, by which time
infectivity is largely
reduced as mumps is a
‘self-limiting’ infection –
meaning that recovering
amounts to symptomatic
treatment and rest.
The infection report-
edly began within the
medics’ football team,
which then spread during
Sports Night last Wednes-
day. An anonymous
source also claimed that
several players won a
match against UCL while
showing symptoms of
the infection, and that the
infection was then passed
on to UCL footballers
– this is currently uncon-
firmed.
All medics are required
to receive double doses of
the MMR vaccine, which
protects against measles,
mumps, and rubella, prior
to clinical contact with
any patient. However, the
vaccine is only 88% effec-
tive according to research
from the US’ Centre for
Disease Control.
Though there was
concern about missed
time on ‘firms’, or clinical
placements, for the affect-
ed students, most firms
are long-term enough
that any missed time can
be made up – especially
accounting for the early
starts, late finishes, and
night shifts that medics
are faced with.
An email sent from
the medicine Faculty
Education Office stressed
to medics the importance
of notifying Occupational
Health as soon as symp-
toms develop and adher-
ing to the recommended
recovery period of five
days – in other words, not
to perform any clinical
duties. They must be
cleared by Occupational
Health before being
allowed to resume those
duties. Fortunately, the
disease is generally only
infectious once general
symptoms of malaise
become apparent, rather
than prior.
Almost all patients seen
by medics are in hospital,
and are therefore under
24/7 monitoring. The
risk to them is therefore
minimised – especially as
medics are keenly aware
of good health and safety
procedures. Ben Russell,
the ICSMSU President,
clarified:
“There is always
the risk of spreading
any normal infection from
person-to-person anyway
as we are working with
many, many patients in
a close environment, but
this is counteracted to the
highest possible degree by
the strict procedures and
regulations which are in
place across the health-
care professions. These
are constantly reviewed
and taught to medical
students as well as staff.”
Medics have taken
the outbreak with good
humour – with the netball
team setting up a ‘bio-
hazard zone’ in Reynolds
during this week’s Sports
Night.

I
mperial has
renewed a part-
nership with The
Times that gives
both students and staff
a free 12-month digital
subscription, tied to
their college accounts.
The College originally
started the partnership
last year, but it was un-
known whether it would
continue.
The offering has been
expanded this year, with
the subscription including
the Times Literary Sup-
plement as well. College
members will also have
access to discounts and
deals, as well as event
access run by the Times
Plus scheme.
Included in the deal is
also an opportunity for
students to enter a com-
petition in order to write
for The Times. Last year,
that student budgets
cannot always afford.
Luke continued: ““Con-
tinuing our partnership
with the Times will help
the Imperial community
to decipher and debate
issues of the day through
access to well informed
journalism.”
Imperial Renews Times Partnership
Felix’s then Deputy Editor
and one of the student am-
bassadors for the first year
of the scheme, Joanna
Wormald, won a similar
contest, granting her
four articles across three
months in the well-known
Red Box column – a daily
political briefing.
“It’s a great oppor-
tunity for the budding
journalists amongst our
students to prove their
writing skills on a national
newspaper,” said Luke
Blair, the Vice President
of Communications and
Public Affairs.
One aspect that is not
returning in full is the
Times-sponsored events
from last year. Though
some were well-attended,
others fell short of the
desired goal because of
scheduling – with the
final event taking place
in the middle of the exam
period. The organisation
of the events was chaotic,
with student ambassadors
reporting feeling confused
and uncertain on what
they were meant to do to
support. However, there
will instead be an event
and speakers in con-
junction with the Great
Exhibition Road Festival
in 2020 – a yearly festival
that Imperial organises
alongside the plethora of
South Kensington galler-
ies and museums.
The partnership has
been praised as being
high-impact for students,
for whom access to
quality journalism is often
locked behind paywalls
