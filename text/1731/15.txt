In Tim Walker’s world
everything is possible.
As I walk through the
door into the exhibition,
I hear Tchaikovsky’s
music playing in the
background. On the walls
hang Lewis Carroll-like
dreamscapes. Only none
of this is produced by
Walt Disney Animation
studios. None of this
is even photoshopped
or CGI, it is all built in
real life. In fact, Walker
shoots mostly in film.
From the quotes scattered
around the photographs it
becomes apparent that he
is a visionary. He reads,
hears or sees something
and can immediately
watch it transform into
a photograph before his
eyes. For this exhibition,
he has gone through
the nooks and crannies
of the V&A, one of his
favourite places in the
world, to find inspiration
for 10 new photo-worlds.
Given the fact that he is
a Londoner himself, this
feels very intimate, like
stepping into his very
own studio. Working with
names like Tilda Swinton,
Margot Robbie, Timothee
Chalamet and Naomi
Campbell, there is no need
to wonder whether he is a
big name in the industry.
Walker is at the top of
the fashion photography
game right now.
Fashion photography
as a phenomenon is rela-
tively new. It only started
about a hundred years
ago after a few decades
of hand illustrated issues
of Vogue and Harper’s
Bazaar. Walker actually
worked as an assistant for
one of the most influential
photographers of this new
wave of fashion pho-
tography, the American
Richard Avenon. It is
clear to see the influence
of Avenon in Walker’s
work, from using the
same models like Tilda
Swinton to using animals
and animal-like poses and
expressions.
Walker plays with
colour, perspective and
scale. He takes a concept
and stretches it like a
rubber band – to the max.
Sometimes the result is
brilliant. Sometimes the
rubber band snaps; the
photos lose novelty. But
maybe this is what fashion
photography seems like to
the outsider. Fashion pho-
tography is intrinsically
flashy. It is pictures of the
aristocrat, of a separate
social class to the rest of
us, wearing brands we
couldn’t even dream of
wearing in places we’ll
never visit. It’s built upon
an aura of unattainability.
Maybe this is why I’m
mostly drawn to his
travel photography, which
constitutes one of the ten
worlds Walker has built
inside the exhibition. The
photos here are still staged
and have elements of
silky dresses, pearls and
perfectly done makeup
in them. But rather than
being taken in a studio
they’re taken in an organic
environment.
That’s not to say some
of Walker’s shots aren’t
absolutely ingenious.
They’re taken straight
out of a gleaming dream
or a beautiful nightmare.
It is definitely worth
checking out for yourself.
If the premise of fashion
photography is to awe the
viewer, Tim Walker hits
jackpot this time.
