Boris Johnson reaches a withdrawal agreement
with the European Union, a 115 page Withdrawal
Agreement Bill was published. The bill outlines
the terms on which Britain will leave the EU and
includes an exit fee, the price sum has not yet
been established, to be paid by the UK to the EU.
The terms are similar to those proposed by There-
sa May with the key distinction being Northern
Ireland. The bill suggests that it would continue
to abide by the EU customs regime, which per-
mits free trade within the union.
MPs were given 3 days to critique
the bill before a final decision was
to be made. The short timeframe
for a such a voluminous and sig-
nificant piece of potential
legislation resulted in backlash
from opposition parties.
The government voted to pass the
withdrawal agreement bill onto its
second reading. The outcome of the
vote was in support of the prime min-
ister’s bill 329-299.
Nineteen Labour MPs, of the 245
seated in the house of commons,
voted in favour of the motion and in
doing so neglected the labour whip to
oppose it, with many reasoning that
they have a duty to fulfil the wishes
of their constituencies. Despite this
triumph for Johnson, with it being
the first time parliament has voted
in favour of a Brexit agreement, his
victory was short lived.
Last week and Monday
MPs also voted on the PMs motion to
push the bill through in three days. Un-
fortunately for the prime minister, his
three day plan was rejected with the
votes outcome being a 308-322 defeat.
The prime minister has sent a letter to
the EU calling for a three month exten-
sion, meaning Britain would leave the
EU on January 31st. However, Johnson
has previously stated that in the case
of another extension, he would call a
general election. motion and in doing
so neglected the labour whip to oppose
it, with many reasoning that they have
a duty to fulfil the wishes of their con-
stituencies.
The most likely outcome and one which the prime
minister himself expects to happen, in which case
he is planning to hold a general election on 12 De-
cember. For an early election to occur, two thirds
of parliament must vote in favour of the motion.
A member of the labour shadow cabinet has stated
that that labour will support the prime minister’s
plan if the possibility of a no deal is ruled out. If
an election is agreed to, the conservative will try to
get their current deal through before beginning to
campaign.
A less likely scenario but John-
son’s preferred option. He will
attempt to get his current deal
through parliament. With La-
bour’s convicted opposition to a
no deal scenario, it’s likely that
they would cooperate with the
prime minister’s efforts.
Full extension to January 31st

Canada’s Trudeau wins minority government
W
hen first
e l e c t e d
as the
C a n a d i a n
Prime Minister in 2015,
Justin Trudeau was a
breath of fresh air for a
country that for 9 years
had been governed by
the Conservative Stephen
Harper. He was young,
charismatic, progressive,
and completely unlike the
traditionally understated
style of politics Canada
has. That year, the Liberal
Party won 184 seats in the
House of Commons, up
from 36 in the previous
election, and Trudeau won
39.5% of the popular vote.
OnTuesday,thecountry
held their 43rd general
election. Justin Trudeau
lost his House majority as
well as the popular vote
by a slight margin, leaving
the Liberal Party to form
a minority government.
He thus remains Canada’s
Prime Minister, but his
narrow victory reflects his
declining popularity over
the recent spate of and
scandals.
One of these involves
the engineering firm SNC
Lavalin charged with
corruption, and efforts by
Trudeau’s government
to pressure the former
Attorney General to
hand down a lighter
punishment, an improper
political interference in
justice matters. The other
involves multiple pictures
of Trudeau wearing black-
face/brownface resurfac-
ing, with him eventually
admitting that he has lost
count of the number of
times he has worn it.
In this context, it’s
clear to see how his rep-
utation as a progressive
hero has eroded. The
Attorney General that
he tried to pressue into
giving SNC Lavalin a less
harsh sentence, and later
demoted for not willing to
do so, was at the time the
most senior government
official who is a member
of the First Nation. His
brownface incidence
brings to mind his un-
comfortably costume-like
attire when visiting India,
for which he then ex-
plained that he has always
“been more enthusiastic
about costumes than is
sometimes appropriate.”
It’s safe to say that
Canadians are choosing to
What next?
keep in in office because
he is simply better than
the alternative.
Without a House
majority to pass legis-
lation on their own, the
Liberal Party will have
to form a coalition with
other parties, likely the
left-wing New Democrat-
ic Party.
