T h i s match was p l a y e d a t Mo3pur P a r k , and I.C.
won c o n v i n c i n g l y ; but the V e t s , pttt up a grand
f i g h t , and indeed had the b e t t e r of a g o a l - l e s s
f i r s t h a l f .
Defence has been our s t r o n g e s t p o i n t f o r the
past two years - as i s borne out by t h e bare two
g e a l s scored a g a i n s t us i n the l a s t n i n e cup games -
and i t was the defence t h a t was s e v e r e l y t e s t e d i n
the f i r s t h a l f . J u s t e s e n and Palmer rose m a n f u l l y
to the o c c a s i o n , supported by P i k e who p l a y e d a
' b l i n d e r ' throughout the match. The r o t of 'cup-
nerves' was stopped, but not b e f o r e Hardy had made
s e v e r a l f i n e saves and the s t e c t a t o r s ' nerves had
had a severe t e s t i n g . By h a l f - t i m e the h a l v e s
had found t h e i r f e e t , and a f t e r h a l f - t i m e the boys
went to town, i n no u n c e r t a i n manner. How t h e
h a l f - l i n e , P i k e , Bennett and Mossman, served t h e i r
forwards w i t h a s e r i e s of q u i c k , hard and a c c u r a t e
passes, c o n c e n t r a t i n g on the l e f t , s i n c e Green was
our most dangerous f o r w a r d . Purslow on the r i g h t
wing had a r a t h e r s c a n t y s e r v i c e but d i d some use-
f u l work, i n support. George and Jones p l a y e d a
s k i l f u l and u n s e l f i s h game, b a c k i n g up B e n t l e y and
Green, and c o n t i n u a l l y f e e d i n g them w i t h short
passes. The s c o r i n g was opened a f t e r a short c o r -
ner had been awarded a g a i n s t a V e t s , defender f o r
pushing a p o s s i b l e s c o r i n g shot out w i t h h i s hand:
Bennett h i t a low screamer from the c o r n e r - h i t , and
had the V e t s , g o a l i e beaten a l l ends up. Only a
minute o r two l a t e r Green scored one o f h i s 'spec-
i a l i t y ' g o a l s . He r a n i n from the l e f t , drew the
g o a l i e , and l o f t e d the b a l l n o n c h a l a n t l y under the

RCS. 3. C & G. - 0.
RCS. narrowly defeated the C & G. by a
penalty g o a l i n the second match of the i n t e r -
oollege s e r i e s f o r the new "Sparkes" Cup.
RCS. k i c k e d o f f a g a i n s t a s t r o n g wind,
and the f i r s t ten minutes were fought out i n t h e i r
'25'. C & G. were v e r y c l o s e to t a k i n g the l e a d
w i t h three attempts t o k i c k p e n a l t y g o a l s . A f t e r
s e v e r a l anxious moments, RCS. managed to foroe
flhlilds back towards t h e i r g o a l - l i n e . A f t e r hammer-
ing away f o r s e v e r a l minutes RCS. were awarded a
p e n a l t y , S.Coppleman l a n d i n g a f i n e g o a l from an
awkward p o s i t i o n and a g a i n s t a d i f f i c u l t wind.
RCS. gained heart from t h i s f i n e e f f o r t and the
t a c k l i n g of t h e i r t h r e e - q u a r t e r s became e s p e c i a l l y
good. T h i s proved to be the only score of the game,
although l a p i n , the G u i l d s f u l l back, was very un-
f o r t u n a t e t o see yet another attempt to k i c k a pen-
a l t y g o a l h i t the u p r i g h t .
The forward play was f a i r l y even, though
the RCS. were s u p e r i o r i n t i g h t scrummaging, but
Were beaten i n the l i n e - o u t s by the t a l l e r G u i l d s -
men.

There was no f u r t h e r score i n the f i r s t h a l f . The
