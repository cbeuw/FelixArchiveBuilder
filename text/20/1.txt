No. 20 IMPERIAL COLLEGE TUESDAY 20 MARCH 1951
COOMBER ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF UNIVERSITY UNION
For the f i r s t time i n the h i s t o r y of the
U n i v e r s i t y an I.C. man has been e l e c t e d P r e s i d e n t
of the U n i v e r s i t y U n i o n . Derek was proposed by
the P r e s i d e n t of U n i v e r s i t y C o l l e g e , David Comins,
and seconded by Jane P a r r y , P r e s i d e n t of K.C.H. &
3.S., and J.W.Gradwell, P r e s i d e n t of the C o l l e g e
of E s t a t e Management. There was no f u r t h e r
nomination.
As readers of the FELIX p r o f i l e on the
P r e s i d e n t of I.C.U. w i l l know (20th. October),
"D.Y.C." came to I.C. i n 1944, and h i s career
comprised P h y s i c s , beer and rowing. He would
have been P r e s i d e n t of R.C.S. i n 1947, but f o r a
s u r p r i s e i n c l u s i o n of m i l i t a r y s t u d i e s i n h i s
c u r r i c u l u m . Since h i s r e t u r n i n 1948, and g e t t i n g
a 2nd. i n F i n a l s , he has been i n t u r n P r e s i d e n t
of R.C.S., and now of I.C.
Since Derek has been i n t h i s o f f i c e he has
been e s p e c i a l l y keen on f o s t e r i n g c o o p e r a t i o n
between the c o l l e g e and u n i v e r s i t y Unions, and
we expect a s p e c i a l e f f o r t i n t h i s d i r e c t i o n next
y e a r . Although t h i s i s the f i r s t time an I.C. man
has been U n i v e r s i t y P r e s i d e n t , I.C. has been v e r y
prominent i n U.L.U. and the A t h l e t i c Union. I n
addition to having two members of the Finance and
General Purposes Committee, we have the present
C a p t a i n and S e c r e t a r y of the Rugger Club, and the
C a p t a i n again next y e a r , and the Convener and
S e c r e t a r y of L.U.D.S.
For V i c e - P r e s i d e n t , Miss V a l e r i e Howard of K i n g s ,
has been nominated , and there was an e l e c t i o n f o r
S e c r e t a r y between John Cooper of B a t t e r s e a , and A l a n
Tate of K i n g s .
