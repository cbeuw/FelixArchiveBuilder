S L I M B O E T J I E
Recently a v o l u b l e character w i t h Smutsian
beard and c o l d blue eyes was t o be seen around the
Union, a l l o w i n g a l l w i t h i n earshot t o b e n e f i t from
his c o l o u r f u l experience. W i t h i n a few hours o f
t h i s South's A f r i c a n ' s a r r i v a l from I r e l a n d ( o r
Czechoslovakia or maybe i t was R u r i t a n i a ) he had
been g l a d l y taken i n ('.) by 2 ex-students who l i v e
i n a n e a r l y f l a t . What a fund of anecdote there
was to be had - not of course t h a t one n o t i c e s the
r a p i d emptying of one's pocket d u r i n g the process.
He was a J o u r n a l i s t , c a t t l e - b r e e d e r , g o l d -
miner, merchant-seaman, companion o f a l l the w e l l -
known f i l m c h a r a c t e r s and w r i t e r s and above a l l a
most c o n v i n c i n g s t o r y t e l l e r . With a l i t t l e ex-
perience one c o u l d detect him weighing up a new
a r r i v a l before l a u n c h i n g out on some new t r u e ex-
perience which would culminate - maybe not u n t i l
the next day - i n a s m a l l loan ( u n t i l next week).
He was never one not t o make h i m s e l f a t home;
perhaps t h i s i s best i l l u s t r a t e d by t h e way i n
which, having helped h i m s e l f t o a c i g a r e t t e from
another r e s i d e n t ' s pocket, he c l o s e d the packet,
he then - profuse i n apology f o r h i s ungenerosity-
re-opened t h e packet and o f f e r e d i t t o i t s owner'.
In 3 short weeks, a cloud of bonhomie and
f a n t a s y had been b u i l t round h i s head, much of i t
b e l i e v a b l e ; under cover of t h i s cloud a t l e a s t
a dozen men had been f l e e c e d o f more than they
would ever i n v e s t i n the Post O f f i c e - and had
r e c e i v e d not one word and t h a n k s l One of our
l o c a l paupers s t i l l cannot understand how t h i s
happened, when f o r 4 years he has n o t been able
to scrounge even a beer from those same people.
Knowing of course t h a t an e x c e p t i o n can nev-
er d e f i n e a r u l e , some o f us may be e»oused won-
d e r i n g why, t h e Empire having been f l u n g so f a r ,
t h i s p a r t i c u l a r p i e c e should s t i c k t o one's f i n -
gers f o r so l o n g .
