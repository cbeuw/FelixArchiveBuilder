emphasised that alternative
accommodation would be found.
The Club, adjacent to the
Huxley Building, was completed
only eight years ago. There have
been repeated problems with its
roof, despite numerous attempts
at repair by College Estates
Section. Currently, the roof is
leaking onto the bar and is
unlikely to survive many more
winters. Holland Club Secretary,
Nick Davies, declined to
speculate on an alternative site
but it is certain to be difficult to
find one of equivalent size with a
central location.
The Club serves non-academic
staff and post graduates.

The Union Deputy President,
Dave Parry, displayed a
distressing ability to see
problems from the College,
rather than the student, point-of-
view in his speech against the
refectory boycott motion at the
U G M on Tuesday. Now that as
DP he has to meet College
officials face to face he seems to
think the only way to get things
done is to be nice to them, and
not to do anything that might
ruffle their feathers a bit. He
claimed that it would be
'blackmail' to state our intention
of holding boycotts if and when
there are any further random
price increases. He wanted this to
be reduced to the threat of
introducing such a policy once
any increase has been imposed.
This would be a classic example
of shutting the stable door once
the horse has bolted. M r Parry
seems to be yet another
sabbatical who, whilst taking
office with the best of intentions,
has been seduced by the endless
round of freebies and committee
meetings into thinkng like a
College official. At this rate it
won't be long before we find the
Union Office moving to the
Sherfield building where all the
o t h e r b r a n c h e s o f the
administration have their offices.
Wearing a poppy in the week
before Remembrance Sunday is a
symbol of respect for all those
who were killed or injured
fighting for Britain in two world
wars. It was distressing to see
then that I C C N D , like other
branches of that organization,
have been selling white poppies.
To try and make a political point
out of Remembrance Sunday is
bad enough, but the selling of
white poppies is surely a
calculated insult to the memory
of those who sacrificed their lives
to ensure that future generations
could grow up in a free and
independant Britain. I hope that
this attempt by the pacifists and
appeasers in C N D to hijack a
solemn occasion of national
m o u r n i n g f o r their o w n
blinkered ends will be firmly
rejected.
