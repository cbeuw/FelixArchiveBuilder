IC 3rd XI—2 vs Unilever—0
Would Unilever whitewash IC?
That was the question on the IC
players' minds as they treked to
Unilever's ground inSE9. Having
lost Sgt Pepper (John Spencer)
on the underground Imperial's
fears worsened.
After an untidy first half with
IC dominating the opposition,
although unable to finish, half-
time half-time was reached with a
blank score-line. Congratu-
lations from Unilever go to
Marcus Shepherd who missed a
penalty flick in this first half. After
changing umpire at half-time,
bringing the captain onto the
field of play, the thirds began to
produce the goods. Goals by
Dave Whitton (at the fourth
attempt) and Ian Mace left the
final scoreline at 2—0. Also there
was a notable performance from
Vernon Morris which enabled
him to end the match in a local
hospital after failing to control
the ball with his chin!
Team: P Choudhury, C Honey, I
Mace, C Harrison, V Morris, M
Shepherd, R Ellis, D Whitton, S
Otto, P Dedlforce, John
Spencer, S Brooker.
IC—0 vs Trent Valley—4
For once IC couldn't make any
excuses about the umpires or
p i t c h for w h a t w a s a
disappointing performance.
After conceeding an early goal,
things began to look up with
some excellent play by the
centre forward, but support for
him was very much lacking. IC
lost their way near the end of the
half and consequently two goals
were conceeded.
The second half started with a
more determined IC team
winning more possession but
when Trent Valley were reduced
to ten men near the end IC were
still unable to convert their
possesion into goals. Just before
the final whistle Trent Valley
scored, ending a second half
which initially promised so much.
Team: J West, A Stewart, P
Smith, KMcCormick, M Hall, M
Hedges, P Oliver, P Dubenski,
Jeff, N Hope, D Gott.
SQUASH
From the number of ladder
results written up in the sports
centre so far, it would seem that
you are all totally bored with
playing squash. Therefore, IC
Squash club are going ice skating
(aren't we!) on Tuesday 13
November. This will be a good
way for everybody to meet other
players and should be really good
fun. Last year everyone had a
Chinese afterwards, this year we
might try one each. W e are also
having a trip to a restaurant to be
announced, on Friday 30
November — sign up on the
noticeboard in the Sports centre
if interested.
ORIENTEERING
NewForest
With head-lamps blazing (except
D o n ' s ! ) c l u b m e m b e r ' s
competed in the Southern Night
Championships last Saturday.
Courses were long for a night
event, though conditions made
for fast times. Inspired by the
thought of a mega-feed back at
Simon's, all IC competitors
finished in the top 20 or so in our
classes.
The following day the team ran
in the November Classic in the
New Forest; where long fast
courses across open land and
golden forest are traditional.
New man Rob Lea finished
within eight minutes of the
former British Championship
(leaving Simon trailing) while a
new force in W21B emerged with
Patsy Wood.
10 PIN BOWLING
Firstly, thanks to the hard core
who have supported the 10-PIN
bowling club week after week.
Secondly, since IC have got a
match coming up very soon,
more people are needed, more
than play week after week that is,
to come along on Wednesday.
Anybody who has ever been 10-
PIN bowling before and, dare I
say it, enjoyed it, I plead with you
(grovel, grovel) to do something
different on a Wednesday
afternoon. You will enjoy it, I
guarantee, especially if you bring
some friends as well.
Anyway, enough of the
crawling, see you all in the Chem
E n g f o y e r , by 2 . 3 0 p m
Wednesday.
WATERPOLO
You can
bank on us
IC—9 Lloyds—4
IC's intense team training paid
off quickly in the rematch with
Lloyds. By the end of the first
quarter College were 4—0
ahead. This waterpolo match
was again one for the whole
squad — each quarter the
Imperial team was altered so as
to give every member a swim.
The last two quarters of the
game resulted in IC scoring five
more goals. Fitness was the
deciding factor as the Imperial
waterpolo players swam quickly
through several sound attacking
moves. The final score reflects
the steady improvement over the
first few weeks of term. Next
week sees the University of
London knockout competition.
(Water polo and swimminmg,
6.30pm. Mondays and Fridays,
IC Sports Centre).
SNOOKER
Cue for
action
This week saw a rest from league
fixtures as IC began their
c a m p a i g n in the a n n u a l
Handicap tournament. Two
teams qualify from the initial
stages and with qualification
depending solely on the
aggregate points score it was
important not only to win but to
win well.
O C L are a 3rd division side
and as such started the match
with a 156 point advantage over
Imperial. In spite of this with
Mike Powell, Aidrian Feasby,
Javed Quereshi and John West
each winning both of their frames
IC moved to a handsome 9—3
victory.
More importantly the deficit of
156 points was turned into a
winning margin of 51 points
which will certainly not damage
our hopes of moving to the later
stages of the competition.
