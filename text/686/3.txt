NUSâ€”
closed shop?
A bill to make National Union of
Students (NUS) membership
voluntary was given its first
reading in Parliament last week.
Mrs Edwina Currie M P ,
D e r b y s h i r e S o u t h ( C o n ) ,
introduced a ten minute rule bill
in the House of Commons last
week, to give students the right to
refuse membership of the N U S .
The bill would mean that a
student's written permission
would be required before an
educational establishment gave a
proportion of a student's grant to
the student union and then to the
NUS. This would end what Mrs
Currie claimed was a closed
shop.
Mrs Currie told F E L I X that
she is seeking a meeting with Sir
Keith Joseph, the Secretary of
State for Education and Science,
and believed that it might be
possible for N U S membership to
be made voluntary without extra
legislation. She claimed that the
lack of opposition to her bill
showed a major change in
parliamentary opinion since the
last time the subject was debated
in 1978, when it aroused
controversy.
Colin Brown, of the N U S ,
spoke angrily about the bill,
accusing Mrs Currie of 'wasting
parliamentary time', and stating
that if she used the language of
trade unionism to describe the
NUS, she was making a mistake.
Mrs Currie admitted that she had
not consulted the N U S before
introducing the bill, and she had
refused to see a delegation from
her local branch of the N U S
when they arrived in Parliament
to lobby her.
Ten minute rule bills have
virtually no chance of becoming
law, but serve as a useful test of
House of Commons opinion.
Imperial College has not been
affiliated to the N U S since 1978.
Obituary
Alasdair Scott-Moncrieff
Alasdair Scott-Moncrieff came
to Imperial College eighteen
years ago and soon involved
himself in the City and Guilds
Union and the West London
Chaplaincy, the two organ-
isations, which along with the
Civil Engineering Department,
were the focus of his formidable
energy and interest. Alasdair
enjoyed the company of students.
He lived for some years as a staff
member of Tizard and Linstead
Halls and always took an active
part in the life of the hall. He was
a founder member of two of the
West L o n d o n Chaplaincy's
student community houses.
Alasdair quickly moved to the
heart of the Chaplaincy, taking
on the considerable burden of
treasurer and administrator of its
short-life housing scheme. The
heart is the right description of
Alasdair's place, because he
really cared for the people in the
houses he was looking after, and
his great energy and ability were
directed by the vision of
community the houses rep-
resented. That same vision
motivated hisjwork for City and
Guilds Union, and his wall-
building, drain laying, surveying
and concrete mixing for the
conversion of Micklepage Barn
in Sussex into a place for many
communities to use.
Unhappily the community he
worked so hard to provide for
others evaded him. He found it
hard to believe in the warmth and
affection people had for him, or
to relax into the deeper
friendships that were offered. He
concealed his long struggle
against depression and despair so
well that even those close to him
had little idea how serious it was
until the despair so undermined
his will to fight that he ended his
life.
We may, with difficulty, be
able to replace the functions
Alasdair carried out in the
College, Chaplaincy, and Union,
but those close to him know
nothing will be the same without
the man himself.
Those of us who can, will pray
that Christ who penetrated the
depths of darkness and despair
and overcame them, will fill
Alasdair now with the affection,
warmth and joy he longed for,
and convince him that these
things really are for him.
David Ashforth, Chaplain
C & G U write: Alasdair was
Guild's Senior Treasurer for
twelve years. This was a job
which carried no material reward
for the many hours of work
which it entailed and yet it was
always accomplished without
complaint. He was also actively
involved with the care of
Boanerges, the Guilds veteran
car, and will be sadly missed by
his colleagues on the Bo
committee.
A memorial service will be held
on Thursday 15 November at
1.30pm in Holy Trinity Church,
Prince Consort Road. A l l
students and staff are welcome to
attend.
Bo romps home!
Imperial College supplied one
official and two unofficial
competitors in the London to
Brighton veteran car run last
Sunday.
One star of the day was
undoubtedly the C & G mascot
Bo, the official runner, who made
the trip in approximately five
hours. Bo was due to arrive in
Brighton at between 12.30 and
1.00pm but due to a minor
lubrication problem was 90
minutes late. Driver Simon
Chamberlain said the problems
were unfortunate as Bo had been
running 'really well lately'; an
explanation which met with some
scepticism from very cold
supporters.
Unofficial entrants were the
RCS fire-engine 'Jez', which
powered itself there and back,
and Derrick, a 1926 motorcycle
owned by C & G .
Everyone finished the day with
the usual 'bumper car' fight in the
fairgound.
