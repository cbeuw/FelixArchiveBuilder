As most of you know the government is
examining proposals to impose a positive
rate of V A T on to books and journals, this
means that you, the book buying public, will
have to pay at least 15 per cent more. As you
are aware books are expensive, now with
V A T would your bookshop be able to stay in
business with fewer books purchased? What
I am asking you to do is write to your local
MP, in fact, any M P and express your strong
opposition to any move to impose V A T on
books.
