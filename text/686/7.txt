Matt Bianco: Half A Minute
This is absolutely and
utterly brilliant. Ever since
'Get Out Of Your Lazy Bed'
I've been waiting for an
equally boppy single from the
Bianco Trio. This is it. Get the
12 inch extended version with
'Matt's Mood' on the B-side, or
even better, get the album
'Whose Side Are You On.' If
you can't dance to this I
should start worrying — even
my granny likes it!
Prefab Sprout: When Love
Breaks Down
Thedebut disc, 'Don'tSing',
made enough money to keep
K i t c h e n w a r e R e c o r d s in
business. Now it's a matter of
whether the follow-up can
achieve anything like the
same success. It's about time
i n d i e l a b e l s p r o d u c e d
commercial music instead of
political statements. Prefab
manage to get the moodiness
of T h e S m i t h s , w i t h o u t
subjecting the listener to their
dreariness and depression. I
love the vocal harmonies, and
ghostly female backing. But
will it sell?
Slade: All Hold Hands
You've guessed it — it's
Christmas time again, and
Noddy Holder and the boys
are back again with yet
another 'Merry Xmas Every-
body' sound-alike. Mustn't put
it down though. I'm sure once
the Y u l e t i d e spirit starts
flowing, I'll be the first to join
in the party sing-along. O n e
thing I don't understand
Mat Bianco-new single just released.
though, is who buys these
singles? There must be a
million people out there
somewhere with copies of
'Birdie Song', 'Agadoo' and
'Shadappa Your Face'. They'll
love this.
Helen & The Horns; Surrey
With A Fringe On Top
RCA are still pushing the
country billy angle on Helen,
six months after it went out of
fashion. It's a pity 'cause she's
got a great voice. Dave Jago
and the rest of the horns are
from IC, and have played
Southside Bar several times,
which is where \ wastalkingto
Ms McCookerybook a few
weeks ago. She claims to want
to get away from this sort of
image. Rodgers and Hammer-
stein have a lot to answer for.

Why is it that no evening
passes without another yee-
haaa God-damned American
car chase on the television?
Well, that's your problem, not
mine. Partly because my tele
doesn't work, partly because I
have a slightly different axe to
grind. You see roads, cars and
going nowhere fast are all
bedded into American writing,
too.
I suppose the first in the
tradition would be Twain's
Huckleberry Finn — n o t
strictly a road book, but in
those days they did their
rough travelling by river, so I
think it counts. The character
'Huck' was created as an
innocent through whose eyes
the author could make wry
observations about the Deep
South. Several generic traits
emerge. The most important
is that the journey cuts off the
main character from his usual
way of life, giving him time to
reflect on his past or on
anything which catches his
e y e . T h i s l i g h t e n s t h e
technical load on the writer. If
he were, say in his home town
and the writer still wanted to
use him to observe people, a
whole network of personal
relationships would need to
be constructed. A traveller has
outsider status, and is easily
presented as a detached
source.
The whole structure falls
into place. The book starts
and ends with the journey.
The uncertainty of travel, and
t h e e n d l e s s r a n g e o f
encounters and incidents
which become credible hold
the reader's attention with
ease. Of course, the author
also gets a chance to strut his
widely-travelled man-of-the-
world wisdom. Twain has too
much taste to fall into that
trap, but later writers are not
always so restrained.
Least restrained of all is
John Irving. He wrote one
g o o d b o o k a b o u t t w o
Viennese students touring
Austria on a motorbike. Not a
great book, but a pleasant
one. Setting Free The Bears
has an inventive setting:
performing bears, circuses,
u n i c y c l e s , m y s t e r i o u s
w o m e n . ' W h a c k y ' protag-
onists, heavy-handed meta-
phor and a very unusual
death. The snag is that he
wrote several other books
which draw on the same
material. The World Acording
to Garp just about made it,
despite the nailedon pseudo-
philosophy of the 'under toad'
and the smart-ass tone of the
writing. The others really
aren't worth the trouble.
Robert M Pirsig used the
other side of the format — the
cutting loose of the central
character — to give a lengthy
discourse on the relationship
between science and art is
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance. Up to the half-
way point, there are clever
ideas here. It is rather heavy
going, however, so save it for
the holidays. The hippy bits
about 'a man's search for his
inner self can get up your
nose, too.
A more complex example is
Kerouac's On The Road. Here,
the observer and the central
figure are two different
c h a r a c t e r s , the f o r m e r
regarding the latter with some
hero-worship. Not enough,
though, to hide the fact that
Dean is at root a failure by
anyone's standards. Des-
peration and escape drive his
travelling.
'Dean was having his kicks;
he put on a jazz record,,
grabbed Marylou, held her
tight, and bounced against
her with the music. She
bounced right back. It was a
r e a l l o v e d a n c e . Ian
MacArthur came in with a
huge gang. The New York
weekend began, and lasted
three days and three nights.
Great g a n g s got in the
Hudson and swerved in the
snowy New York streets from
party to party. I brought
Lucille and her sister to the
bfggest party. When Lucille
saw me with Dean and
Marylou her face darkened —
she sensed the madness they
put in me.
'I don't like you when you're
with them.'
'Ah, it's all right, it's just
kicks. We only live once. We're
having a good time'.
'No it's sad and I don't like
if.
The feel of crazed escape
has been turned to comic
effect by several writers, not
least Dr Hunter S Thompson.
A good collection of his
s t r a n g e b r a n d of s e m i -
journalism can be found in
The Great Shark Hunt. Be
assured that sooner or later
the good Doctor will be
howling along a freeway in a
s t o l e n car, h a v i n g just
swallowed an inhuman mix of
hallucinogenics, whisky and
speed. The style can pall if you
read a lot of it once, but as the
book is in short episodes this
is less of a problem than you
might think. Nixon gets a
thorough mauling, along with
many lesser-known Amer-
icans figures. The book pre-
dates Regan's Presidency, but
he does rate a couple of
amusing side-swipes.
Penguin publish a quarterly
lit mag called Grant. It comes
in the form of a paperback
collection of short stories and
extracts, with a minimum of
comment. Issue ten is devoted
to travel writing, and is well
worth your attention. This
brings us into a slightly wider
field of subject matter but the
world is a big place.
Oh, inspiration and wide
open space.
