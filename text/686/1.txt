UGM MOTIONS
Huge Boycotts
IC Union will hold lightening Refectory Boycotts if College
put up prices again, Tuesdays UGM decided.
Hugh Southey, proposing the
motion on refectory prices spoke
of the haphazard way price
increases were currently decided
and called for the swift
installation of the long-overdue
computerised accounting system.
Any further arbitrary increases
should, said M r Southey, be met
by forceful action from the
Union; students were always in a
minority at committee level and
College authorities continuously
ignored their views.
Opposing the motion David
Parry, I C U Deputy President,
called the motion 'ill-conceived,
ill-timed and ill-worded'. He
suggested a less militant
approach, calling the use of
boycotts a form of blackmail,
and advocated employing the
threat of possible action as a
means of enforcing the students'
v i e w p o i n t . M r S o u t h e y
r e s p o n d e d that C o l l e g e
authorities were no longer
swayed by threats â€” there had
been no refectory boycott for the
last five years. A n organised
series of weekly boycotts, where
by only one outlet would be
affected at any one time of day,
would exert maximum pressure
on the refectory committee. After
questions, the motion was
carried conclusively.
The motion on student loans
was proposed by Graham
B r o w n , c h a i r m a n of I C
Conservative Society. M r Brown
favoured loans as an alternative
to the means-tested grant since
they afforded students a greater
degree of independence. His
devotion to a 'market-force' view
of the economy was not well
received, however.
A radical amendment to the
motion was then proposed,
supporting the award of a full
grant to all students. Speaking
for the amendment M r Gareth
Fish referred to the loan system
as 'a millstone around a student's
neck' and suggested a full
mandatory award as a more
effective way to make students
more independent. M r Brown
cited examples of other countries
which had a loans system, and
did not foresee that students
would have problems making
repayments. In spite of this the
meeting voted to accept the
amendment. The amended
motion was proposed by Mr Fish
and subsequently passed.

College wins appeal
Imperial College has won its
appeal over increased rates
charged by Westminster City
C o u n c i l since 1980. A
substantial rebate is expected to
be paid.
The case dates from 1973 when
the rateable value of the central
block of College Buildings was
reviewed by the Inland Revenue.
College disagreed with the
v a l u a t i o n a n d f o l l o w i n g
negotiations fixed a new value
with the Inland Revenue. The
position was furtheT complicated
when the Huxley Building was
included in the Rating list from
1977, however college and the
Inland Revenue agreed on the
new total valuation.
Westminster City Council
appealed to the Greater London
Valuation Court against the
original review and also
increased the percentage used to
reach the rateable value from
3'/2 % to 6% (the normal
commercial rate) in 1980. In the
past Universities and Colleges
have been charged rates at lower
levels under the terms of the
'Provincial Memorandum' which
favours educational premises
over commercial ones. The Court
decided in favour of West-
minister Council for higher
rateable values but reduced the
percentage from 6% to 4'/2 %.
As this case affected many
Colleges and Universities all over
the country, the University
Grants Committee decided to use
Imperial College as a test case
and appealed against the courts
decision at a Land Tribunal. The
outcome of this was a reduction
in the rateable value to below the
original 1973 level. The Land
Tribunal also decided to reduce
the rates back to the original 3'/2.
The ruling, seen as a victory for
Universities and Colleges , is still
subject to a 28 day appeal
although College hope that
Westminster Council have no
grounds for this.
