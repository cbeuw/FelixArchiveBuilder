THE WORLD AFTER NUCLEAR WAR
The Nuclear Winter - Fact or
Fiction?
When Dr Richard Turcp andDr Anne
Ehrlich come to Imperial College
next week as part of their much-
heralded tour of Britain, along with
Prof Paul Ehrlich and Dr Georgiy
Golistyn, the anti-nuclear weapon
lobby will at least be given some
strong evidence for it's case. The
extent of, or the means of achieving
nuclear disarmament is obviously
dependent on one's political bias, but
the nuclear winter theory (which is
what it is) cuts right across any
political affiliation's and appeals to all
of us simply on grounds of
common sense. Are we prepared to
risk extinction of not only the human
species but ALL life as we know it for
the. sake of our so-called national
security? The results of several
different independent studies on the
global climatic effects of a nuclear
exchange in the northern
hemisphere are all basically the
same. Since the predicted
consequences are eco-catastrophic
and have already prompted the US
and British Governments to initiate
their own studies, just how strong is
the evidence for a nuclear winter?
What are the likely long-term effects
of a nuclear exchange? What size of
nuclear exchange would be required
to produce these long-term climatic
changes?
To date, the major study on the
atmospheric consequences (Nuclear
Winter: Global Consequences of
Multiple Nuclear Explosions. R P
Turco, O B Toon TP Ackerman, J
B Pollark, Carl Sagan, 23 December
1983, Vol 222 P 1283-1300 — referred
to as TTAPS) has come up with some
fairly chilling predictions. Basically
what happens is this: With the
detonation of nuclear weapons there
would be an enormous amount of
dust hurled into the troposphere and
above it, the stratosphere together
with smoke/soot from the very large-
scale urban and rural (particularly
forest) fires. The dust and soot would
form a cloud enveloping much of the
hemisphere causing drastic
ecological effects for months after a
nuclear war. There would be a
considerable drop in light intensity
and other alterations in solar
radiation, these include an
increase in UV-B after some months.
A second disastrous consequence
would be the drop in ground
temperature, over the area of the
hemisphere enveloped by the cloud.
A third consequence would be
alteration of the gas composition of
the atmosphere and the increase in
toxic chemicals released principally
from fires within urban/industrial
complexes. A fourth consequence
arises from the radioactive
exposure of human beings directly,
and indirectly through absorption by
plants and animals in the foodchain.
TTAPS infact applied their model
to several different scenarios:
exchanges of between 100 ana
Dr B Morrison Aero
15,000 megatons (15 000 MT is a
reasonable estimate of the total
world stockpile), a varying
distribution of targets (eg urban and
rural target) and different ratios of
ground to air burst.
These scenarios all gave
predictions of temperature drops of
between — 10°C and — 30°C. Even
small nuclear exchanges could
trigger severe after-effects. A
scenario involving only 100MT
exploded in the air over cities could
produce a two-month interval of
subfreezing land temperatures, with
a minimum near —23°C. In this
scenario, thousands of fires would be
ignited and the smoke from these
could generate a period of cold and
dark almost as severe as the baseline
case of 5000MT. The temperature
drops not only because of the sun's
.radiation being absorbed and
reflected by the dust, but also by an
inverse green house effect where
radiated (infra-red) heat from the
earth is not blocked by the smoke
and dust.
How reliable are these
calculations? The study by TTAPS
used a one-dimensional model
(height) for modelling the effect of
particles. Other studies by different
people using 3D and two —
dimensional models (latitude —
height) and circulation models
support the TTAPS results. Also a
compilation of data from five major
volcanic eruptions this century
showed a cooling pattern similar to
that predicted by the general
circulation models.
The consequences for animal and
plant life are difficult to gauge
accurately but some basic
conclusions are clear. For plants a
five per cent reduction in sunlight is
sufficient for photosynthesis not to
sustain the plant. Oats, Barley and
Rye will be very badly hit by
temperatures of 0°C in spring,
whereas they can withstand lower
than — 10°C in late October. Drops
of only a few degrees could be
castastropic. A whole rice crop can
be lost if the temperature drops
below 13°C, rice is the staple diet of
about half the worlds population. The
increased UV radiation will harm
plant leaves and reduce photo-
synthesis, it will also reduce the yield
of the plant and weaken it's
resistance to other hazards. It
reduces animal resistance to
infection too.
It seems likely that the major
findings of these studies are unlikely
to be contradicted. Of course
proponents of nuclear deterrence
may well say that predictions of a
nuclear winter confirm the
effectiveness of deterrence. This
seems almost too ghastly to
contemplate, logic gone beserk.
Perhaps one day, the advocates of
nuclear weapons will realise that the
freedom that they wish to preserve
has been all but eroded by these
same weapons.

WOMEN AND PEACE
'Women don't feel as men do about
war. They are the mothers of the
race. Men think of the economic
results, women think of the grief and
pain'.
. (Dr Aletta Jacobs, Holland's first
woman Doctor, speaking in 1915).
The Women's peace movement
did not start at Greenham common
as many people seem to think .
Women first came together as the
Female Peace Society in America in
1820; but the roots of the movement
stem from much farther back in
history. For centuries women have
been bearing the grief and pain of
wars — mourning for sons,
husbands, lovers, brothers, going to
their deaths in 'wars of plunder, wars
of conquest, wars of religion, wars of
PRIDE, wars of succession, wars of
idle speculation, wars of unjust
interference...'. As Anne Barbould
wrote in 1793.
Throughout all those centuries
some women have spoken out
against war and militarism. Now
seeing the threat of nuclear
extermination, their vocies are
louder than ever. Today's Women's
Peace Movement is widespread and
encompasees women from all walks
of life — not just 'man-hating lesbians'
as the popular press would have us
believe. Greenham women are
indeed everywhere.
On November 15th, Danielle
Grunberg, international coordinator
of the Woman's Peace Alliance, will
be speaking at IC on the importance
of the womens peace movement in
the struggle for disarmament. The
Women's Peace Alliance is an
'umbrella' organisation of groups and
individuals from many countries,
involved in a variety of activities. This
should be an illuminating talk giving a
wide perspective view of the
Women's Peace Movement today
and its role in the future. Everybody
is welcome to attend the meeting, at
1.00pm on Thursday, November 15,
in Physics LT 2.
