i
President to eat
in Southside!
Peter Teague, IC Union President, will force himself to eat in the Southside refectory
at least once a week from now on. He is taking this drastic step in order that he can
monitor the quality of food being served their. This came out at the UGM yesterday when
he was proposing the refectories motion printed in Monday's issue of F E L I X .

A t long last the R o y a l
College of Science Union has
an office it can c a l l its own .
Up until now the R C S U Office
was i n the room above South-
side Shop belonging to the
Summer Accommodation Service.
T h i s meant that the office had
to be evacuated of a l l traces of
R C S every summer t e r m .
But now, with the opening
of the N e w Huxley B u i l d i n g ,
things have changed for the
better. T h e new, purpose-built
office, situated at the west
end of the Sherfield walkway,
comprises a s m a l l executive
office for administrative purposes
and a larger meeting room
which has been equipped with
plush, new c h a i r s . T h e one
major drawback of the new
office was neatly summed up by
V i c e President C h a l k y White:
"There's no bloody windows" .

Large crowds attended this
year's Freshers Fair which
was held last Tuesday after-
noon. This is tbe second year
running that the Fair has been
held in the Union Building —
previously, the Fair was held
in the JCR, Sherfield Building.
Over ninety clubs and
societies were present at the
Fair to try and convince the
hordes to join their particular
club or society. However, the
advice given to the freshers at
the Freshers Reception on
Wednesday made Freshers
cautious in parting with any
monies 1
The bar staff worked
extremely hard to provide
liquid sustenance for the
hundreds of people who come
to the Fair! Brendan, the
Union Bar manager said that
his staff, full and part-time
could only be commended for
their efforts and the unusually
long hours they worked.
Many experienced Fair goers
thought that tbis year's was
quite successful and it certainly
attracted more people than it
has done in tbe past few years.
There were two amendments
to the motion w h i c h was f i n a l l y
passed b y a n overwhelming
majority. Both amendments
were to the s e c t i o n " I C
union n o t e s " . T h e words
after refectories in pdint four of
the section were deleted and
a seventh point a d d e d . T h i s
noted that the government's
canteens i n Westminster were
heavily s u b s i d i z e d .
It was brought out at the
meeting that the refectories
had made a total loss of £44000
when the catering reserves had
been taken into a c c o u n t . It has
been decided to pay off this
debt over a period of three t o
four years.
The catering s y s t e m i n the
College had not been reviewed
A t the freshers' reception
last Monday, the Rector, the
IC Union President a n d
several other officers of the
Union delivered speeches to
the U G and P G fresh men and
women dealing with a l l aspects
of College and U n i o n affairs .
The main theme of the
speeches w a s participation'
and involvement in the C o l l e g e
and Union acti\«ities. In ' h i s
speech, the Rector impressed
upon students the importance
of "an active and involved
Union" in C o l l e g e life and the
need to give it "our utmost
support" i n order to make it
"truly representative of the
students of this College".
for 10 years and the President
did not feel that this was
good enough considering the '
advances that had been made
in this field i n this p e r i o d .
What was required was a n
independent body t o investigate
the C o l l e g e ' s catering s y s t e m .
T h i s body would report i t s
findings to the Refectory
Committee a n d this report
would a l s o be published i n
F E L I X . It was quite clear that
many people agreed with the
motion although some of them
appeared not to fully understand
its a i m s . T h i s l e d to a lot of
confusion and time wasting i n
the meeting.
There then followed attempts
to d i s c u s s a motion proposed
We have enjoyed massive
redevelopment in the last
twenty years...", he s a i d .
However, the c a s h shortage
facing universities would delay
plans to increase undergraduate
student numbers. A l s o , there
were fewer women i n the
College much to everyone's
sorrow and strenuous efforts to
d e a l with this problem were i n
hand.
He a l s o went to talk about
the refectory price increases
and the C o l l e g e ' s position
with respect to the U G C ' s
self-balancing r u l e s . There
was very little the College
could d o about the problem,
but they were looking into

at the meeting. T h i s attempt
finally failed when the quorum

Peter Teague speaking later
at the reception outlined the
issues w h i c h would be facing
students i n the Union this
y e a r . Accommodation was one
of t h e s e . "We have got about
1200 students in College
accommodation — that is not
enough... I do not feel we
should be satisfied until we
have every student who wants
to go into College accommoda-

On the question of refectories,
