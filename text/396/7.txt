IC W A T E R POLO T O U R 75 By Andy Smith
In the early hours of Saturday, June 14th (well, about 10.30am),
IC Water Polo C l u b said goodbye to the easy life and once again
went West, (ie we went I ast year as w e l l ) . The advance party
comprised Paul Hindle, C l i f f Spooner, J i m W i l l i a m s , Kosta Ribar,
Mark Taylor and Andy Smith while the seventh member Sniffy was
recrukea on the way down.
T r W e was to be no respite
and just an hour after reaching
Lymington we were in the
water and playing the first
match. T h i s was In the open
air sea water pool on the front
and against an enthusiastic
Lymington s i d e . However, with
sterling work from J i m in
dele nee and goals from Andy
(4), Kosta(2) and Cliff(2) we
managed to scrape an 8—6 w i n .
This was despite the referee
being completely unimpressed
by Bluebottle's dives of Rodney
Marsh vintage.
We then carried on to take
up residence in our first c l a s s
accommodation — two caravans
at Osmington M i l l s near
Weymouth. E x c e l l e n t food was
supplied by our catering
manager Spooner (if you were
in the right caravan) although
the curry nearly proved too
much f a J i m . A n y further
requirements were amply
catered f a at the nearby
Smugglers Inn.
The next match was against
Bournemouth on Tuesday
evening (and indoors) by which
time Paul Hindle,and Kosta had
returned, as planned,to London
to be replaced by R a y L e w i s ,
Ian Bales and Paul F r i e z e . We
got off to a bad start with the
defence looking very jittery,
but C l i f f was determined to
enjoy himself which several
of the opposition found out to
their c o s t ! So although I
thought we'd lost (well, there
were a lot of goals to add up),
it turned out we'd won 11-10 —
goals coming from C l i f f , P a u l ,
Rory and A n d y . Much needed
refreshments were then supplied
In the local fire station where
the Bournemouth secretary was
actually on duty.
The third match was the
one we were a l l looking
forward to, e s p e c i a l l y those
of us who'd been the year
b e f a e . The match was in the
river at B r i d p a t in the early
evening on Thursday. However
our two biggest worries, the
temperature of the water and
the sewage had improved from
the last o c c a s s i o n , s o there
were' no serious casualties —
though Mark and Paul might
disagree as they were s t i l l
shiver hg after several whiskies.
Ian Bales did a grand job
playing in goal, a position
where you can't swim around
to keep warm. A s f a the
match itself, we won that 7 - 3
In front of an appreciative
crowd of w e l l over 30 people.
The final match was a
return game against Lymington
on our way home. T h i s turned
out to be an easy match as they
were without the services of
two of the-ir better players, and
we strolled in f a a 6 - 2
victory. U n f a t u n a t e l y we then
agreed to play an extra quarter
and my sunburn blisters finally
submitted to external pressure
and burst — the Friday had been
a glorious day and had been
taken full advantage of on
Weymouth beach,
So thanks must go to C l i f f
and J i m f a supplying the
t r a n s p a t , and Paul Hindle and
Mark f a a g a n i s i n g the raffle
which supplied the life giving
funds.
Polo C l u b meets every Monday
and Friday at the pool at 7pm,
to which a l l are welcome. So
don't miss this fine opportunity
to increase the quality of your
existence. A holiday (sorry I
mean, tour) in the West
F i n a l l y , the Swimming and Country could be yours !
IC G L I D I N G C L U B R I S E S
T O G R E A T H E I G H T S
By Nigel Leak
The G l i d i n g C l u b ' s highly s u c c e s s f u l year has progressed to
even greater heights with the achievement of four ' G o l d ' height
flights during the last two weeks in September.
A group of members took the C l u b ' s Dart, s k y l a r k and syrid icate
Dart up to Aboyne, in the highlands of Scotland in search of the
lee waves shed by the mountain ranges in westerly w i n d s .
Although the weather was not always kind, much.flying was.done
and four members, two of them students, achieved height gains
qualifying for half of the Gold
badge of the Federation
Aeronatique International. T o
achieve t h i s , the pilot had to
gain in e x c e s s of 3000m (9841
feet) In height after launch .The
greatest gain achieved was
when Tony P a t e r (Maths III)
managed to get the clubs Dart
up to a height of 15,300 feet
above sea level after an initial
launch of 3000 f e e t . A l s o
qualifying was Nigel Leak
(Aero III) who managed 12,900
feet hi the club S k y l a r k . The
disappointment of the trip was
when Mike L i n c h (Mech Eng
III) had to terminate his climb
only a couple of hundred feet
from his goal to dive 8000 feet
to get through a hole in the
cloud s o as not to loose sight
Of the quickly disappearing
ground.
This soft of flying is very
•rewarding and for somebody
who hasn't done it, hard to
imagine. A l l I can say is that
to me, sitting in my cockpit,
over two miles up, looking
down on nearly 2000 square
miles of Scotland, it was
truely incredible .
F i n a l l y I would like to thank
our ex-student members for
organising the expedition,
supervising our flying and for
towing two of the gliders on the
1200 miles round trip.
Student Welfare
by Don Adlington, Student Counsellor
This s e s s i o n , Jaqui Gerrard (Acting Union Welfare Officer)
and myself and, we hope, some other, interested students — are
starting a new service to students in the Student Welfare room on
the top floor of the Union B u i l d i n g . The room wi II be staffed — by
students the other three days, from 12.30pm to 1.30pm every
weekday of T e r m . We w i l l have a supply of useful leaflets on a
variety of subjects and these can be taken away freely f a your
own use.
But the essence of the
Student Welfare Centre is that
there w i l l be someone there
with whom you can d i s c u s s
personally any difficulties you
may have, and who. may have
a c c e s s to infamation, advisory
services and other sources of
he Ip which are not so obviously
available on demand. There is
a lot of evidence that many
students experience anxiety
relating to e s s e n t i a l l y practical
matters. F a example, q u a s i -
legal difficulties with land l a d s
in respect of the terms of a
tenancy agreement are very
common, and a few minutes
talk may make it clear whether
or not you need to see a
S o l i c i t a . Similarly contacts
with the Police a with the
Courts can be very disturbing
(especially so f a overseas
students) and the Student
"Welfare Centre w i l l try to put
things into context f a you,and,
if necessary, put you in touch
w i t h a S o l i c i t a .Accommcdatjon
and financial problems are
probably foremost among the
practical difficulties affecting
students now. In the Student
Welfare Centre we w i l l not have
lists of accommodation a
bundles of five-pound n o t e s .
What we w i l l . h a v e is the time
to listen, and we may be able
to suggest possible lines of
approach which have not
occurred to y o u .
Of course many things which
upset us are nothing like so
straightfaward, and everybody-
even the adequately housed and
adequately financed - runs into
more personal difficulties every
now and a g a i n . It often does
help to talk to a sympathetic
listener at such times, and we
might, of course, find it
perfectly easy to talk to our
t u t a a s u p e r v l s a , a to a
friend. But again there Is good
reason to think that some
people cannot do this . If that is
how you see yourself, and you
would find it easier to talk to
someone confifjentially through
a " h e l p i n g " agency in your
own Union B u i l d i n g , just c a l l
in.
R U G B Y T R I A L S
Imperial College R F C
w i l l hold trials at Harlington
on Sunday October 4th.
Prospective players should
meet at 12.45pm in the
Union for departure by

Only if you attend these
trials can we ensure the
best possible teams.
A " P i e 'n m a s h " supper
w i l l be held on our return to
the U n i o n . So, for a good
game of Rugby and a sociable
evening we look forward to
seeing you on Saturday.
