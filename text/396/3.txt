CFOOD GUIDE
Many of you will, by now, have had occassion to sample some
of the delights of Mr Mooney's kitchens. This being the case,
several points may have struck you regarding the quality of food,
service and hygiene ot the refectories. We do not propose to go
into these matters here .
For those of y o u w h o are
particular about the food you
eat, we have compiled a list
of restaurants in this guide
where one c a n obtain meals at
reasonable prices.
The list has been roughly
divided into three sections
according to p r i c e . The first
c o n s i s t s of those restaurants
which serve s i m i l a r meals to
those in College refectories,
but of a much better quality .In
the second, restaurants w h i c h
offer a slightly widerrange of
choice in dishes and of a
higher price are listed . These
are the sort of places worth
v i s i t i n g at weekends w i t h
friends.
The third and last area
includes restaurants only to
be visited on rare and s p e c i a l
c c c a s s i o n s .
T h i s is an alternative eating
guide and should be used a s
s u c h . It provides you with a
wide range of restaurants with
matching p r i c e s . G o o d eating!
Cheapies
These purveyors of fine food are on the whole, for the
main course, slightly dearer (but only be a few pence —
don't forget they have waitress service) than Mooney's
refectories. They offer a wide selection of dishes (main
course 3Op — 50p). However, their deserts (which are not
obligatory, but nevertheless recommended) are rather more
expensive (15p — 20p) than those in Southside.
These establishments are to be regarded as Mooney's
rivals — their prices reflect the high turnover of satisfied
customers and hence their inexpensiveness with no loss to
service .
Should you live near, in or are visiting Kangaroo Valley
(Earls Court to Barry McKenzie) then one of " P o t " restaurants
is where you are most likely to eat. The recommended one
is the 'Hot Pot' in Kenway Road'. Here you can obtain
delicious Mousaka for 50p or succulent Roast Chicken for
45p and even good Spag. B o l . (Spaghetti Bolognese to the
uninitiated) for 35p . If this den of iniquity doesn't grab you,
then try the 'Chelsea Kitchen' on Kings Road or the 'Stockpot'
in Basil Street. The menues in these places are changed
daily.

Hamburger Joints
For the lovers of the American way of life, it is possible
to savour the American craving for plastic food in central
London. There are a large number of establishments, varying
widely in appeal, which cater for this'. You can also be
served by 'Butch Boys', 'Leggy Beauties' or even have
decent food at Strikes, GAS and GAD respectively'.
Albert's Plum offers loud music, large portions, titillating
waitresses and its proximity to College. There is also a
disco in the evenings which is worth a visit if only to
experience a Harvey Wall banger.
' On the other hand, if its 6.00am. and you're tired, hungry
and have lots of loose change, then GAS is the place for
you. Here, the waitresses, showing practically all that
nature gave them, are the main attraction'.The food however,
does not quite match up to expectations.
If however, what you require is good food at reasonable
prices, there is only one disaster area to go to — GAD .
Everything on the menu is well cooked and the range
stretches past hamburgers. One can quench one's thirst
with the iced water provided or indulge in a fruit-flavoured
milkshake (at 35p the best to be had anywhere in town). At
71p a plain hamburger,and chinsserved with lots of chilli
sauce is very good value indeed'. Their barbecued spare
ribs (£1 50) is a memorable feast which can be topped — off
with a portion of chocolate fudge cake (40p)'.

We move up a little this time and consequently explore
a wide variety of international dishes. In the odd occasions
when a few of you want something different (not women! —
or men!?!), it is worth trying one of the restaurants in this
group'. You can explore several varieties of curries in the
'Curry Palace' in Gloucester Road. Gastronomes may start
with a Kebab served with a tossed salad'.
If you want to really 'blow your mind', order an extra hot
and chilli spiced curry'. If you want to blow other peoples'
minds, an onion bha gee will do the trick admirably'. In this
category, the Hussain' in Thurloe Place is heartily
recommended.
The 'Bristro Vino' serves reasonably cheap Italian meals
if that's your fancy. Their Avocado Vinigrette is unlikely to
