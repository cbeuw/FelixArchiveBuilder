Reflections until October 21st
ARIES (22Mar—21Apr): The main a c t i v i t i e s are centred around
p a r t n e r s h i p , formalities and public relations. About the 14th
Jupiter is in opposition to the Sun and this may cause extravagance
in money and/or e m o t i o n s . Nonetheless, its retrogate motion
through A r i e s eases your problems and may bring back into your
life some of the persons and conditions w h i c h were fortunate for
you last May and June .
TAURUS (21 A p r - 2 1 May): From the 5th until the end of the
month your planet Venus transits your solar house of s o c i a l life,
pleasures and love affairs. Y o u may find yourself attracting some
members of the opposite s e x . E s p e c i a l l y about the 10th when the
Moon trines Venus they may find your magnetism i r r e s i s t a b l e .
Anyhow, the main theme is workand this may prove time consuming .
GEMINI II (22May-22Jun): T h e Sun and your planet Mercury
are in your area of s o c i a l life, entertainment, and love a f f a i r s .
These w i l l be the main attractions of the month.New friends a n d /
or a s s o c i a t e s w i l l be entering into your life. Favourable aspects
around the 9th and 19th may cause you to flourish in the s o c i a l
scene or y o u may get to meet some interesting people .
CANCER (23Jun—23Jul): Jupiter brightens your area of status
and career. Around the 9th, 14th and 19th good aspects from the
Moon indicate you may gain prestige or respect over others. Or
your work may become e a s i e r . New developments may occur in
your love life. Venus w i l l make you more attractive to others
e s p e c i a l l y around 8th and 1 0th and you are likely to meet many
possible dates or make new friends.
LEO ( 2 4 J u l - 2 3 A u g ) : The Sun and Mercury are both in your
area of intellectual a c t i v i t i e s , communication (meetings, c o n -
ferences, m a i l , phone), short journeys, relatives and neighbours.
These w i l l play an important role until the 24th. Around the 9th
their cOTifOrt^tion indicates a highly fortunate day in these areas.
The 13th may prove difficult if you follow i m p u l s e s . Nonetheless,
Venus brings some security into financial a f f a i r s .
VIRGO (24Aug—23Sep): Venus transits your own sign indicating
harmonious relationships and possible financial gains. P a r t i c u l a r l y ,
the 10th and 21st when the Moon trines it, are fortunate d a y s .
Romantically, it looks very promising and you may find yourself
making new friends e s p e c i a l l y from the opposite s e x . From the
17th Mars may activate partnerships and friendships or further
them.
LIBRA (24Sep-230ct): Jupiter is in your house of partnerships,
formalities and public relations,. These w i l l almost flow on the
9th and 19th due t o good a s p e c t s . The 13th may prove difficult in
these areas. Owing to Saturn square Uranus you may find your
hopes and wishes being limited and feel rather introverted on the
12th and 2 0 t h .
SCORPIO ( 2 4 0 c t - 2 2 N o v ) : While Venus enhances your hopes,
w i s h e s a n d brings harmonious relationships withfriends particularly
on the 10th and 2 1 s t , Jupiter protects your health and w o r k . After
the 17th Mars activates interest in travel or academic pursuits.
Uranus may inject some creative impulses and y o u may be tempted
to mix business with pleasure.
SAGITTARIUS ( 2 3 N o v - 2 2 D e c ) : Y o u may find yourself meeting
new and interesting people through s o c i a l gatherings and parties.
Mercury and the Sun in your s o c i a l house indicate a month full of
S o c i a l a c t i v i t y , a s s o c i a t i o n s , invitations and involvement with
groups. It's most likely a romance (or two) w i l l spring from these
a c t i v i t i e s perhaps around the 9th or 19th .
CAPRICORN ( 2 3 D e c - 2 0 J a n ) : Your main interest is having a
good start at work. Y o u may find yourself involved with superiors
in relation to career considerations. If not, it may be that you are
concerned about your future career. Venus brings harmony into
your work, s o c i a l and love life. These w i l l thrive throughout the
month particularly on the 1 0th and 21 s t .
AQUARIUS ( 2 1 J a n - 1 9 F e b ) : Owing to Uranus square Saturn
certain difficulties may arise in partnerships and this could lower
your prestige unless you employ some diplomacy. Until the 17th
Mars energizes your s o c i a l and love life. It grows your interest
in the opposite s e x . After the 17th this energy is converted into
useful work.
PISCES (20Feb-21Mar): Jupiter is in your money area and
this means a financially good month. Extravagance in money or
emotions is possible around the 13th. Venus w i l l harmonise
partnerships particularly on the 10th and 2 1 s t . From the 17th Mars
goes into your area of romance and when w e l l aspected a s on the
6th and 15th it can mean a c t i o n ' The 21st is e s p e c i a l l y fortunate
for the P i s c e a n s . c ic
