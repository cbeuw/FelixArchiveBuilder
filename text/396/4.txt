I Spy, War Correspondent.
Loyal peasants of Imperial C o l l e g e , your day of redemption
from the evil bureaucratic clutches of National S o c i a l i s t s , National
C a p i t a l i s t s , International S o c i a l i s t s and International C a p i t a l i s t s
has come! A mighty force of levity, w i t , gentlemanly aggression
and c i v i l i s e d warfare has sprung from A l b i o n ' s Lions in the
Antipodean regions of the B r i t i s h E m p i r e , at the express command
of that arch-enemy of gravity, darkness and despondancy. The
Wizard of The A n t i p o d e s . T h i s force of ' L i g h t and Might' is
known to a l l the world as A l f ' s
Imperial Army, a name which
already strikes terror into the
dark recesses of the self-
hating, corrupting and u n -
B r l t i s h I n f l u e n c e s of
s e r i o u s n e s s . T h e A r m y ' s patron
and Warlord Is non-other than
His Levity, The Wizard
H i m s e l f .
So far units of A l f ' s Army
have scourged and cleansed
the campuses of the University
of Melbourne and the University
of Canterbury (for the Ignorant,
in Chrlstchurch New Zealand),
eliminating and thoroughly
crushing the Republican rabble
infesting those hallowed h a l l s .
From these bases repeated
pitched battles have been
fought against the forces of
gravity and depravity. Latrobe
University has been smashed,
the hairy barbarians of the far
South of Otago are routed and
converted to the true faith.
Preparations for the Invasion
of the North Island of New
Zealand are now underway,
with plans projected for the
re-invasion of A u s t r a l i a .
Tremendous victories have
been won but now a darker and
more forbidding task, one w h i c h
holds great promise for the
'Levity Loving People's of the
World", stands before u s . I
refer to the overthrow of the
Tyranny of Despair and
Gravity within the British
Isles themselves.
For this sacred task two
highly trained henchmen of
The Wizard are even now,
plotting within these Islands.
They are General D i r e c t i o n ,
Glorious Commander A l f ' s
Imperial Army, Pedes D i v i s i o n ,
already known to you by the
a l i a s of Derek B a n k s , posing
as ex-student, s c i e n t i s t , part-
time teacher, part-time drop-out
(but .in fact a dedicated drop-in),
sorcerer's apprentice and
Lev national Genera l i s t . The
other recently arrived minion
of Antipodean necromancy Is
nonother than C o l o n e l Catford,
glorious Commander of A l f ' s
I m p e r i a l A r m y , E a s t e r n
Antipodes D i v i s i o n and known
to his " f r i e n d s " as Tony
Catford, sometime salesman,
labourer, cook, dishwasher,
mountaineer and scoutmaster,
he poses a s a bungling
imcompetant daydreamer whilst
hatching out the most brilliant
schemes everdevlsed todestroy
The-World-As-We-Know-lt.
These two half-wits have
now combined to throw their
whole w i t Into Imperial College
and e s t a b l i s h a unit of A l f ' s
Imperial Army, cleanse the
campus, undermine Londo'n
from w i t h i n , and overthrow the
Republican - usurpers of Her
Majesty's Government. A t the
momentwhenthe B r i t i s h peoples'
are most convulsed with
laughter and mirth, they plan to
launch a war against the Rebel
American C o l o n i s t s , Install
Richard N i x o n as the new
Governor-General of the
American C o l o n i e s , Spike
Mllligan as the Governor of the
South Island of New Zealand
and then to rebuild the B r i t i s h
Empire and more, armed with
plastic swords, flour,water and
Imagination. Their sole excuse
Is that every other option Is
positively boring.
A l l this is a mere side show
compared w i t h The Wizard and
his plans for his F i r s t Advent
Upon Tower H i l l . The first
attempt to appear there out of
nothing w i l l be made in the
coming months!
Beware the People's
Republic of Oxford Street and
their lackeys and running dogs!
Confound their politics.
Frustrate their knavish tricks;
On thee our hopes we fix:
God save the O ueen.
