be surpassed in many other places. For the main course,
Escalopes in wine sauce, is a must.
Assuming you are a typical student on a typically mean
grant, but who still likes French food, the 'Bistingo' (Old
Brompton Road) is the place for you'.

A womanizer's paradise (or very nearly) is a restaurant
that offers a conducive atmosphere for conviviality. Here
the maxim of 'Wine, women and song' is fully practiced.
Needless to say, any of the restaurants in this group are
worth a visit, especially those in Beauchamp Place.
Of note, is the 13V» (of the same address?). Trout in
almond white wine sauce or chicken in pepper and tomato
sauce are the specialities of this family concern.
Nautical inhabitants of South Kensington may on the
other hand find themselves washed up outside a very fishy
looking place at the junction of Exhibition Road and Thurloe
Place. Upstairs, an Olde Worlde atmosphere is completed
with a pianist singing music hall songs help you digest
some of the best fish in town. The place in question is of
course the — oops! Nearly gave it away'.
A quid to whoever can prove, to the Editor, that they
have eaten a meal in this restaurant'.

AND NOW
At £x a head we introduce the restaurants to visit when
money (not Mooney, silly) is no object. Before you go along
with your intended, unintended, could be or just picked-up,
book in advance. This bascially means popping along a few
evenings beforehand and inspecting the atmosphere, decor
and of course the menu. If this seems satisfactory, you
place a booking and tell your partner anything you like
afterwards.
Tradition and intimacy are the easily recognisable
features of these restaurants, so choose according to the
gentleman's and er-lady's preference.

Energy
Help to SLICE costs by using energy
wisely in the College .In 1975 energy
costs, mainly for heating and electricity,
are estimated tm increase by about 50%
over last year. With no increase in the
Government grant to the College, this
means that YOU will have to make do with less - facilities
e g. laboratory materials, lecture notes, UNION grant, in
order to pay the increased energy bills.
You can help by:
•Closing all external doors and windows
•Switching off all unnecessary lights
•Using minimum hot water
•Thinking twice before switching on power con-
suming equipment - even if you are doing a
routine experiment.
•Remembering to switch off as soon as you have
finished.
Any suggestions for SLICING energy costs should be
sent to
SLICE c/o Dept .of Electrical Engineering .
