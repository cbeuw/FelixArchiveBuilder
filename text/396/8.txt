SECURITY NEWS
The attention of Students, particularly new arrivals to the
C o l l e g e , is drawn to the s e r v i c e s provided by the security staff
and they should not hesitate to contact the S e c u r i t y Officer,
Room 163 Sherfield B u i l d i n g , internal no: 2741 regarding any
matter concerning security and in particular any of the following
matters:-
Lost Property
During the course of a year hundreds of items of personal
property are found and handed into the security office « « much
of it never claimed by the l o s e r s . Students and staff who lose
Items of property should promptly report them to the security officer
and in many c a s e s a speedy restoration w i l l r e s u l t . S i m i l a r l y ,
persons finding such items of property should promptly hand them
to one of the messengers or security staff.
"it is pertinent to mention that on the first day of the new
session two wallets containing a total ot£210 together with hand-
bags and other Items were handed into the Security Office and
restored to the losers" .
Thefts
A s to be expected, in institutions of this kind which allow
such freedom of a c c e s s periodical spates of s t e a l i n g occur
and students are asked not to leave their valuables lying around in
drawing offices, laboratories e t c . The stealing of w a l l e t s from
clothing and purses from handbags are the most common types of
offences and these items should be either carried on the person at
a l l times or locked away when not required. Pedal c y c l e s are
another target for thieves and when these are brought on to the
campus they should be secured to the c y c l e racks by means of a
stout chain and heavy padlock. The use of p l a s t i c covered c a b l e s
with patent locks as sold by many dealers, are totally i n a d -
equate for this purpose and a number of c y c l e s which had been
secured by this means have been s t o l e n , above a l l , if you value
your c y c l e insure it.
Car Parking
U n l e s s you have been authorised to park your car on the
campus*; please do not bring it into the c o l l e g e car park otherwise
you are likely to cause considerable inconvenience to some
person who has a parking s p a c e . Derelict v e h i c l e s a l s o are from
time to time a source of embarrassment to the C o l l e g e and any
vehicle w h i c h has ceased to be roadworthy should not be left on
the car park where it may q u i c k l y become c a n n i b a l i s e d . Motor
c y c l e s should be registered in the security office and parked only
in the s p e c i a l places allotted .Parking them in the s p a c e s between
motor cars c a n result in damage being caused to both motor cycles
and c a r s .

International Socialists
w h o are we?
The International S o c i a l i s t s are the largest revolutionary
s o c i a l i s t organisation in B r i t a i n . A t Imperial C o l l e g e there is a
" w o r k p l a c e b r a n c h " which has the main perspective of building
a strong s o c i a l i s t presence w i t h i n the trade unions on c a m p u s .
Current members of the branch are a l l a c t i v e members of the
College based trade unions N U P E and A S T M S and are committed
to fighting for militant p o l i c i e s on wages and c o n d i t i o n s , and for
extending democracy to achieve rank and file control.
Students are encouraged to
join or work with IS members,
and in the past undergraduate
members have committed them-
s l e v e s to the main trade union
w o r k . A n IS society was formed
last year, membership of which
is open to IS student members,
and a l s o to those supporters
who read our weekly paper
S o c i a l i s t Worker and Identify
with IS p o l i t i c s . T o date the
IS Soc. has concentrated on
International Issues and played
a leading part In last years
campaign against the National
Front's intrusion onto the
campus . T h i s year, if sufficient
students are Interested, the
society w i l l a l s o play a
Vigorous part in Student Union
politics . The problems facing
students — cut backs in public
expenditure, higher staffing
ratios, the closure of C o l l e g e s
of E d u c a t i o n e t c . — form just a
part of the Government's
attack on living standards. The
fight against the cuts at IC
must be an integral part of the
campaign which we are working
to build among the rank and
file of the B r i t i s h Labour
movement .
Overseas Students
The IS branch has forged
strong links with many of the
overseas students at IC. The
continued domination of third
world countries has an important
technological aspect and moves
to counteract this w i t h i n the
C o l l e g e should be part of the
p o l i t i c a l a c t i v i t i e s of overseas
students in particular .Overseas
students are welcome to work
directly with IS and gain
experience of B r i t i s h p o l i t i c s
w h i c h are directly those of an
advanced industrial s o c i e t y .
However, in c a s e s where
students w i s h to make their
involvement informal, or even
anonymous we recognise the
seriousness of their p o s i t i o n s .
