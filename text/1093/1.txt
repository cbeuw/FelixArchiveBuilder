Part of the ornamental 'dental
course' that decorates the top of
the crumbling Garden Hall par-
tially collapsed in late August.
A piece of stucco fell from House
nine, hitting the railing and shatter-
ing into smaller pieces before land-
ing on the pavement. It was about
half a metre in length but fortu-
nately did not hit anyone or do any
serious damage. The Estates divi-
sion of Imperial cleared the debris
away and cordoned off the area,
putting a "Beware Falling Masonry"
sign up on a post. Scaffolding was
erected quickly, after the local
council was notified, to protect
pedestrians and the children that
attend the nursery below. It con-
sists of "a full-height scaffold with
an access level and netting. There
is a fan running under the access
level, at the first floor level, to catch
any other falling debris." The pro-
tective fan runs from house eight to
ten as the dental course on those
houses could also collapse.
it has been revealed that poor
workmanship, completed some
time ago, on the balcony of house
nine led to damp setting into the
surrounding stonework. The stucco
was bonded to the building and the
moisture weakened the stonework,

causing the bond to deteriorate to
the extent that it could no longer
hold the plaster up against gravity.
After inspection by a consultant
engineer, the rest of the House 9
plaster was removed and the face
of that part of the block is current-
ly in the process of being repaired.
A structural engineer completed a
survey of the whole Garden house
block but found that the problem
was only in the local area of the
damaged plaster and pronounced
the rest of the block to be in an
IC accommodation
at crisis point
The record has been set straight
on a rumour circulating Imperial
College that concerns a signifi-
cant overcrowding problem in
Halls of Residence. Despite an
extra 200 places being made
available to most Universities,
Imperial College admitted a fur-
ther 200 freshers over that limit
this year, and many were not allo-
cated a place in Halls due to an
insufficient space. Speculation
over those students' whereabouts
included bed and breakfasts and
small hotels around the West
London area, or that London stu-
dents had been forced to stay at
home. One student said that he
would have to commute to
London every day from Worthing
on the South Coast until a room
could be found for him in Halls.
According to Sharine Brown,
the Domestic Manager of Imperial
College and one of the senior
members of staff dealing with the
housing problem, only 8 8 first year
students still do not have a place
in the South Kensington Halls. The

acceptable, safe condition.
The rooms inside the Hall
appear to be deteriorating rapidly
according to several students who
lived there during the summer.
However, although paint is peeling
and cracks are growing on ceilings,
the Estates Department are confi-
dent that the building is not 'falling
apart'. There are plans to develop
and refurbish the block, inside and
out, but nothing is expected to
happen for at least six months as
funds and permission are organ-
ised, although a contact in the
finance department told Felix that
the maintenance fund currently has
an unspent surplus of over
£2million.
