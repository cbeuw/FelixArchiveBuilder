The News Team lifts the lid on the controversial Dearing Report on the future of
Higher Education funding. The question is: can you afford not to read this?
T h e D e a r i n g R e p o r t
The National Committee of Inquiry
into Higher Education - the so-
called 'Dearing Committee' - was
set up in May 1996 by the then
Conservative Government to
examine ways in which the higher
education system could develop,
primarily over the following two
decades. The committee, chaired
by Sir Ron Dearing, consisted of
seventeen members including the
Rector of Imperial College, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh. It also comprised
of senior staff from Exeter,
Strathclyde, Glamorgan and Open
Universities, and a student repre-
sentative from the University of
Wales in Cardiff as well as a range
of industry moguls.
More than ninety recommen-
dations were made by the commit-
tee, concerning a whole range of
issues such as the setting up of
Quality Agencies and the establish-
ment of formal training courses for
lecturers. The biggest controversy
however appears to be the com-
mittee's suggestions that students
should contribute more to the cost
The Bottom Line
In the table opposite "Higher
Income" families are regarded as
those with income over £34,000
after deductions for such matters as
pension contributions and mort-
gage interest. The "Lower Income"
group refers to those households
with earnings of less than £16,450
per annum.
Maintenance Grant is currently
paid by Local Education Auth-
orities, means tested on the basis
of parental income. Maintenance
Loan currently comes from the
publicly owned Student Loans
Company, with plans to privatise
this debt in development. Parental
contribution is that which the
Government expects guardians to
give their student children.
of their education, only to have the
newly-installed Labour government
come to a different decision on
matter on the eve of the report's
publication last July.
After behind-the-scenes dis-
cussions with the National Union of
Students, ministers attempted to
ease the potential unpopularity of
all students paying £ 1000 per head
by agreeing to a means-test. This
would results in the poorest stu-
dents paying nothing and the
wealthier ones pay the full fee.
The Government announced its
intention to replace student grants
with loans, also contrary to the
Dearing recommendations which
tried not to deter poorer students
from the higher education. The
Minister for Higher Education,
Baroness Blackstone, said the NUS
"have publicly said... that they are
unhappy with Dearing proposals to
charge for tuition. We are trying to
mitigate Dearing's proposals by
excluding low-income students."
She did concede however that
richer students would "still be pay-
ing less in terms of the loan repay-
ments than a student from low
income family who will have a
somewhat larger loan." For its part
the NUS president, Douglas
Trainer, said "We are very pleased
about the decision on means-test-
ing fees but we believe the princi-
ple of fees is wrong and we will
campaign against this."
Although Sir Ron Dearing him-
self played down the sidelining of
these proposals, some members of
his committee were said to be 'furi-
ous' over the government's public
airing of its own proposals before
the report's publication. "It is a
matter of serious regret that the
government should come to a
decision in private without first lis-
tening to the responses of the
committee's recommendations."
Another said "The problem is that
what the Government has come up
with is a half-way house, and not
surprisingly, it is a mess. For the
government not to allow time for a
debate on our recommendations is
deplorable." University heads also
expressed doubts. "We have a big
question whether today's propos-
als will meet the funding gap that
the government itself acknowl-
edges," said Diana Warwick, chief
executive of the CVCP. Baroness
Blackstone attempted to assure
universities that any extra money
raised would go to HE funding.
Other proposals put forward by
the Dearing Committee covered
matters ranging from the aims and
purposes of higher education, and
use of information technology - the
latter recommending that all
students have access to desktop
computers by the year 2001 and
that students have their own lap-
tops by the 2006.
The role and qualities of staff
was also addressed. The commit-
tee remarked that there was con-
cern among academic staff that the
esteem of their profession needed
raising, and noted that staff in HE
are paid much less than compara-
ble jobs in both the private and
public sectors.

Mr Simon Wright, Education and Welfare
Officer from the University of Wales at
Cardiff, entranced by discussion during a
visit by delegates from the Dearing Commis-
sion to Imperial College Union earlier this
year. The Rector of Imperial College, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, also attended the meeting
and was one of seven academics on the sev-
enteen member committee. Others involved
in the review included representatives from
Glaxo Wellcome, Psion, Ulster Bank and the
Weir Group.
The Latest
A full and frank discussion
What was predicted as being the
contentious issue of the Labour
Party Conference, held at the end
of September in Brighton, turned
into a non-event as the party
machine closed in on potential
rebels. A raft of pre-conference
motions criticising the
Government's plans to charge stu-
dents tuition fees and abandon the
long cherished policy of free edu-
cation promised heated debate.
In the event only two delegates
braved the wrath of their party
leader and spoke out against pro-
posals and insisted that education
should be "inclusive not exclusive".
As a first year student at
Strathclyde University, Johanna
Baxter had less to lose than most.
The only other delegate unwilling
to publicly toe the line was Maria
Exali of the Communication
Workers Union, who questioned
how the Secretary of State for
Education could "stand and claim
you want to create more equality
of access and introduce a method
of funding that undermines that
very principle?"
Facing certain defeat, after
David Blunkett's rousing defence of
the government's proposals, dele-
gates opposing the move withdrew
their motion.
Gap year policy finally filled
After weeks of deliberations, with
'sources' suggesting that those
carrying out charity work during
their gap year could receive prefer-
ential treatment, on 13th August
the Government agreed to exempt
all students wishing to take a year
out from the new funding regime.
Baroness Blackstone's statement
followed her condemnation a week
earlier of press speculation,
describing it as "irresponsible
scaremongering".
These announcements came
too late for the estimated 1 7,000
students who panicked into aban-
doning deferred entry in favour of
ensuring a less debt-laden educa-
tion. While the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals insisted
that universities would be able to
"cope" and the Government
announced that the increase was
"manageable".
The extra students, which rep-
resent 6% of the planned first year
population, could result in universi-
ties being surcharged by the
Government. Imperial College's
200 extra freshers could cost dear-
ly as each educational establish-
ment is only allowed a 2% margin
from its target intake.
Mass Expansion - of 2.5%
Confusion broke out in the wake of
contrasting statements from the
Prime Minister and the Secretary of
State for Education over the expan-
sion in student numbers. Tony Blair
announced during the Labour Party
Conference that his Government
would "lift the cap on student
numbers and set a target for an
extra 500,000 people into higher
and further education by 2002."
This ambitious target seemed
to be at odds with David Blunkett's
earlier suggestion that he would
seek places for an extra 40,000 or
50,000 students. This would repre-
sent an increase in the participa-
tion rate of 18-21 year olds from
the current 32.5% to 35%. The con-
fusion exposed by these differing
declaration is expected to be
cleared up by the publication of the
Government's detailed plans for
higher education - expected in
November.
