RETURN FIRE
Dear Sir,
With reference to your letter of
last week, do you not think that it
is a perculiarly American disease to
assume everybody in the world
wishes to be like onself? Take, for
example, the ease with which your
American reader to informed us all
that, because our system of gov-
ernment is not exactly the same as
hers, we were all mentally ill (two
subjects on which, 1 should add,
she appeared to display a ridicu-
lous and insulting lack of under-
standing).
i would like to inform you
American reader that many people
in this country are working very
hard to stop it becoming at all like
hers - not least in the area of gun
legislation, where the same free-
doms she seems to hold so dear
allow one murder to happen every
eight seconds in Washington D.C,
Detroit and Chicago. That makes
nearly 1 1,000 murders every day
(the population of a small town), in
each of these cities alone. Perhaps
the "right to bear arms" might have
been more carefully thought out if
people had known that so many
Americans would turn on their fel-
low citizens in blood.
1 do not mean to insult your
American reader personally - in
assuming that we all wish to be like
her, she is mearly saying what
comes naturally. I think instead
that her country's education is
probably to blame for the insuffer-
able arrogance of some of its citi-
zens.
Yours faithfully,
Matthew Rollin, ICSM
PS. If the Queen is decended from
God, and yet every king born was
the sun of a whore, then presum-
ably she is accusing the Almighty of
pimping? That ought to do down
well on the day of judgment.
Dear Felix,
I have just read the letter from
Kelly Green. Is she for real? What
an absolute load of garbage, or
should 1 say "trash". I don't think 1
would call her necessity to walk
around with an armoury in her
handbag, freedom.
As for the rest of her com-
ments, she just seems to have a
grudge against the English for
some reason. Why is it that
Americans flock to places like
Buckingham Palace? 1 don't sup-
pose, with comments like that, she
has ever been here herself. 1 don't
suppose, however, that we would
particularly welcome her here.

Dear Felix
As a contributor to this fine
journal, it is indeed gratifying to
know that we have a global reader-
ship (Felix 1092) Not only that, but
we have
some older fans as well.
Judging from the fact that her son
found out that England has a King,
Kelly Green must be about 80 years
old (though if her son really is 18,
then she may simply be young and
very, very stupid). This of course,
explains the advance dementia she
appears to he suffering from.
Rarely have I seen such a spectac-
ularly arrogant incorrect, incoher-
ent, jingoistic, nasty piece of
uncreative writing. Apart from
that, though, it's dreadful.
Given that dissecting these dis-
eased ramblings is as easy as
shooting fish in a barrel, it is diffi-
cult to know where to begin. As
many of you know, T am not exact-
ly a wishy-washy liberal, but M s
Green's views on the right to bear
arms, misquoting the Second
Amendment, is terrifying.The idea
that liberty stems from the right
and ability to blow people's brains
out is a curious one. If T lived in a
country where I felt I needed an
M l 6 to protect myself, I would be
on the first plane out. The monar-
chy clearly gets this women dan-
gerously excited. Her defamatory
comments on the Queen are too
pathetic to deserve comment. To
suggest that 'the whole country
must be filled with morons' is
pathetic, and sadly gives credence
to the notion that Americans are
entirely ignorant of the world
beyond their borders; this is not
the case- indeed one of my
American colleagues offered his
profound apologies for this
woman. The system of constitu-
tional monarchy is, I believe, the
most prevalent form of govern-
ment on the planet, so a UN reso-
lution to bring them down by the
'use of armed forces' is plainly
stupid.
She rambles at great length
about freedom. A constitution
guaranteeing your rights' is inter-
esting. Would this be like the con-
stitution that segregated blacks in
the deep south until the late
1960s? Simply because we do not
have a written constitution, which
as the US has shown is open to
much abuse, does not mean we
have no rights, and further exem-
plifies the breathtaking ignorance
of this woman. The Freedom of
Information Act is also intriguing.
Would this be like the one that kept
files on John Lennon secret for 32
years? Such laws would, of course,
prevent anti-democratic abuses of
power by government officials. J
Edgar Hoover? Oh dear.
'The citizens of Great Britain
have potential.' Madam, we are
truly honoured. If it is your belief
that you an example of what the
British should aspire to be, then the
'mental illness' you attribute to us
seems more applicable to explain
the case you have so spectacularly
failed to elucidate. '1 cannot under-
stand how any sane rational person
could make a case for the
Monarchy.' It is a shame that, as
an American, you are deprived of
all sense of irony. If you're sane,
may I continue to be a chicken.
Yours sincerely
