C ^ y ^ It's conference season
,\SJL| again. Labour spent one
| ( H L ' week and plenty of money
patting itself on the back
for its performance during the
election, and the Conservatives
now have their turn, except theirs
will probably be a more despon-
dent affair. However it seems we
are sadly not to get our full happy
blast of Conservative propaganda
as Labour are injecting stories
and events into the press before
and during the conference. First
came Tony Blair's trip to Russia
(where he starred in a radio soap
opera!). Next came Bill Gates'
publicised jaunt to 10 Downing
Street where he will undoubtedly
promise to spend squillions of
pounds on something very mod-
ern. But the most worrying story
is the complaints by the new
Labour women MPs that the
dinosaur Tories have been
harassing them.
Conservative MPs have been
accused of plenty of things in the
recent past, not least of which
has been incompetence in their
jobs. This is a very different thing
from being accused of making
sexist jibes. Real harassment is
an appalling verbal assault that
has no place in any workplace or
institution, and offenders can be
seriously disciplined for it.
Therefore such accusations must
not be taken lightly, janet
Anderson MP (a senior Labour
whip) revealed that complaints
had been made against a number
of Tories (curiously enough, she
revealed this on the first day of
Conservative party conference).
We are told in grave tones that
MPs have been "sniggering" and
"heckling" women during their
maiden speeches. She says that
the men "should grow up".
I would suggest it is the
women who need to do the
"growing up". They have pres-
sured the parliamentary authori-
ties into reviewing videos and lis-
tening in on the microphone
recordings of the Commons in
case the Speaker didn't catch it.
They are only doing this to the
Conservative benches. Apart from
the Orwellian undertones of such
actions, it is an abuse of their
position in government to
observe and record every utter-
ance of the Opposition's
Members. Tory MP Michael
Fabricant had to "put up with
Tony Banks (the sports minister)
blowing kisses to me across the
chamber and Dennis Skinner
challenging me about my hair". A
Labour MP once said of Teresa
Gorman: "she's got more hor-
mones than a Christmas turkey".
Accusing a woman of being
"menopausal" is in the same
league as accusing an ex public
schoolboy of being "a poof" or
"inbred", common terms of insult
in our Parliament. John Major
once said John Smith had less
chance of understanding the
economy than Donald Duck had
of winning Mastermind.
The problem underlying this is
that the women who have made
the complaints (all are new to
Parliament) may have come from
a background where vicious per-
sonal insults are rare and the
preserve of the school or office
bully. The reaction to such com-
ments (excepting those that are
particularly serious and damag-
ing) should not be to withdraw
and complain, but to bounce back
and hit them just as hard. All
ministers will have learnt this the
hard way (look to Margaret
Thatcher for inspiration there). In
fact there were complaints that
Miss Betty Boothroyd (the
Speaker) was giving female MPs
an especially hard time. It
seemed she had little sympathy
for those who chose to come into
this institution and "have it easi-
er" than she did. She and others
like her saw a huge influx of peo-
ple come in, often half their age,
and when they didn't like what
they saw they complained. When
someone enters politics they
should be wary of complaining
about others being nasty about
them. Some of these people will
be in government in the near
future, exercising considerable
power when others their age are
fighting their way through the rat
race. Although real abuse is not
acceptable, someone with the
personal clout to be in govern-
ment should be able to cope with
occasional sniggers and taunts.

Right then, subjects, now that you've
stuffed your tiny little cupboards with the
finest fruit, veg and meat London can
provide it's time to get cuhin'.
Our first culinary adventure is
Splodge. This is my and many other stu-
dents' survival ration. It's easy to make,
cheap and versatile and it's also healthy
and balanced in a tasty sort of way.
The ingredients are:
• Tomatoes - either a tin of peeled
plum tomatoes from those places we
don't mention but have super and mar-
ket in their names or about a pound of
fresh tomatoes chopped into smallish
cubes (around lcm3) which are far tasti-
er and full of yummy vitamins.
• 1 onion (yellow or Spanish) - chop or
slice it according to personal preference.
Personally I find chopped bits roughly
4mm x 4mm are tops.
• Garlic - a matter of some controver-
sy. I'd go for 2 cloves (NOT bulbs, con-
fusion over this point might result in your
having no friends at all). Crush and
roughly chop them.
• Various veg - basically chuck in what-
ever you've got: Carrots, courgettes,
peppers, beans etc. Go for lots of colour
and variety. Chop or slice.
• Some meat (optional) -beef / lamb /
pork (minced or cut up braising stuff) or
for those really low budgets a tin of tuna
chunks in soya oil which make for some-
thing differently interesting. Cut up bits
of bacon also work well.
• Salt &. pepper &. spices.
That's it for the boring preparation stuff
(or "prep" in the arsy chef lingo) so now
straight into the fun bit.
First, chuck the tomatoes in to a pan
and put on a low heat with a fairly large
pinch of salt (to taste as the saying
goes). Then heat up some oil (olive oil is
the best and yes I know it's expensive
but frankly you don't use it up that
quickly and it really is better) in a frying
pan over a half maximum heat. You want
it to just start smoking before dumping
the onion in. Give it a good stir every
now and then so it doesn't burn. When
the onion starts colouring (yellow to light
brown) add the garlic and carry on frying
for a few more minutes. Put the mixture
in with the tomatoes which should be
bubbling gently by now.
Now repeat the process with the
vegetables but don't overload the pan
otherwise they'll boil instead of frying.
The aim is to get everything nicely
browned so you get loads of lovely
caramel and no soot. Do the same thing
with the meat.
At some point, add the pepper and
spices so they have a good fry as well.
That way you get all the aromatics and
volatile lovelies to come out and give
your food that scrummy taste we're all
after.
Once you've finished frying, pour a
small glass of water into the pan and get
it to boil a bit before pouring it into the
tomato and general stuff mixture. That
way you get all the good bits that have
stuck onto the pan into your food and
you end up with a clean pan. Cunning,
eh?
Now the beauty of this sophisticated
dish is the if you use mixed herbs (ore-
gan, basil, thyme etc) you get a basic
bolognaise but if you use curry powder
you get a curry and if you use chillis you
get a chilli con random stuff. Three
meals for the price of one. Finally, serve
with rice, pasta, spuds or whatever is
appropriate.
