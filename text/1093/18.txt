Colours of the Indus charts the his-
tory of Pakistan through the textiles
and clothes traditionally worn in
this region. Although Pakistan only
became a country in the modern
sense fifty years ago, its culture can
be traced back to 5000BC and
beyond. The earliest textile
sample was found in the val-
ley of the Indus, evidence
that the craftsmen mastered
dyeing and weaving tech-
niques long before other
civilisations in South Asia.
The exhibition covers the
four regions of modern
Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan,
Punjab and North West
Frontier.
As the crossroads at the heart
of Asia, this region has had an
unusually large number of outside
influences which is reflected in the
variety of its textiles. Seasonal
nomadism as well as more perma-
nent migrations from Iran,
Afghanistan and Central Asia have
resulted in a distinctive style rich in
vibrant reds, luxurious embroidery
and costly materials. What is par-
ticularly astonishing is that these
clothes were and to some extent
still are worn as people go about
their normal business.
The Punjab is the most prosper-
ous province as is evident in the
garish colours and expensive mate-
rials such as silk, satin, gold- and
silver-wrapped thread. To this day
Lahore is at the heart of Pakistan's
culture. This is in contrast to the
woolen clothes, black or dark indi-
go, decorated with coloured
embroidery of the North West
Frontier.
A selection of accessories are
also on display: bags, hats, shoes
and animal adornments. A pair of
carved wooden platform shoes
from the beginning of this century
predates high fashion from the
nineties by eighty years.
These shoes served a more
practical purpose though.
They were designed to
keep the wearer clear of
the dirt and not to fall off
like Baby Spice!
The overall impression 1
left with was that of a
nation that enjoyed vibrant
colours and rich sensuous
materials, not just for cere-
monious occasions, but also in
day-to-day life. In fact the opposite
to our own minimalist, strictly utili-
tarian habits. It is sad that this her-
itage is increasingly threatened by a
mass-produced, mass-marketed
style coming from the West. 13
