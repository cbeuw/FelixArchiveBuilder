re you a James Bond fanat-
ic? Then you may be inter-
ested in a record being
released by the David Arnold
Project called Shaken and Stirred.
This features cover versions of
classic Bond theme tunes by the
likes of The Propellerheads, Pulp,
Leftfield, Natacha Atlas and LTJ
Bukem. Released on 20th
October, this promises to sell very
well indeed considering the fact
that there is a new Bond movie in
a few months. However, what
Louis Armstrong would have
thought of Iggy Pop covering his
throaty number, We Have All The
Time In The World, I don't know.
The Doors are making another
comeback...sort of. Set to be the
'crowning jewel' of the Doors'
back catalogue, the package will
contain four CDs most of which
have been previously unreleased.
One of the tracks, Orange County
Suite, features Morrison on vocals
and piano with new music record-
ed by the remaining Doors added
to it. There is also a new video for
Break On Through which uses
excerpts from the band's last ever
performance on the Isle of Wight.
It is released on 27th October.
The Shirehorses are to release
one of the worst albums ever...lit-
erally! Their new album The Worst
Album In The World...Ever features
all the classic recordings made by
Radio 1 D) Mark Radcliffe, Lard
and their group of 'musicians'
including Baby Bloke {You're
Gormless), The Charley Twins
(West Country Boy) and Dick Cave
and the Bad Cheese featuring Riley
Minogue (Hapless Boy Lard). The
boys have bowed to public pres-
sure and are to reform for a tour
this Autumn, coinciding with the
release of the album on 3rd

e're late. This is not a
problem, as lateness has
always been endemic in
to the music industry, which is part
of its appeal but also the main rea-
son that it is such a pain in the arse.
We've also missed the support
band Sukia which, a friend at the
bar told me, was no bad thing.
I don't know what to expect
tonight. Will we be pogoing in one
of those intense, crushed affairs
with short but energetic fourteen-
year old girls competing with slight-
ly strange, totally tuneless twenty-
somethings wearing shirts but no
deodorant to pledge their devotion
to their latest plastic Jesus?
Unlikely. I can imagine the dance
floor spotted with moody techno-
heads dressed in alien ways per-
forming their odd rites in studious
denial of the existence and absurdi-
ty of those around them. But there
doesn't seem to be the required
critical mass of misanthropists with
billiard-referees' gloves and blue
painted inner tubes on their heads.
The set starts, and we shove to
the front. The band immediately
commit the sin of playing several
brand new tracks in a row.
Nobody's dancing as the songs
merge together into a dreary ennui,
with supposedly post-modern but
actually crap keyboard nagging at
the monotonic bass, the lyrics
incomprehensible even to my
French companion. A hairy knob in
front of me is preparing a steady
stream of spliffs, using his girlfriend
as a makeshift rolling mat. The fact
that he was able to perform this
dexterous operation in the middle
of the gig speaks for itself.
There's a lull in the music, and
the keyboard player starts pumping
out slow, ugly chords on a dismal
old Wurlitzer rattle-box. Fourths;
the devil's chords. He's concen-
trating intently, focussing on the
appaling resonances. Laetitia starts
to sing, the drums come in at
speed, and suddenly I begin to
understand. The people are jump-
ing now as the music climbs up and
up, building into a throbbing
soundscape that absorbs the evil
chords greedily. It's fast enough for
a good bounce, but you have to
jump high. The music is raucous
and untidy but has a mesmerising
trance quality that has us sailing up
and down in appreciation. After a
time between ten minutes and
eighty years, the guitars drag the
music into a climactic, decelerating
cacophony. But emerging from the
sea of noise is a new beat, a faster
beat, that seems to fit in with dev-
astating accuracy, and the party
continues. One by one, the ele-
ments of the music fall away to
leave only the mighty Wurlitzer, still
pumping away. Only now it makes
sense, and the melody of the
chords is obvious, explained by the
massive voice of the music.
When Stereolab finally decide
to let us back onto the ground, I'm
unable to keep still, my muscles
twitching to any kind of beat. I'm
ridiculously high and, once again,
see clearly the reasons why I make
the unusual effort to travel and
wade through mud, vomit and
sweaty arseholes just to see half an
hour of music. For all it's myriad
faults, live music is the biggest, the
best and the most. Live music is
music. CI

FANTAZLA
Manchester G-Mex
The 31st of October will see rev-
ellers enjoying a night of music in
the G-Mex centre in Manchester.
Not since Fantazia's sell-out event
at the Glasgow SECC in 1993 has
an indoor event of this size been
organised and this one will hope to
out-do that one in the very least.
The show has recently toured
Europe, Australia and the United
States and now returns to the UK
where the G-Mex will host 12,000
people for 12 hours. The line-up
will be as follows:
The Main Arena: Carl Cox, Danny
Rampling, Jeremy Healy, Boy
George and Tall Paul.
Garage Nation: The London
Dream Team, Jason Kaye, Mike
'Ruff Cut' Lloyd and Lisa Unique.
The Chemical Lab: Experimental
sounds from Jon Carter, Cut La Roc
and Monkey Mafia.
The G-Mex will be decorated
for the event with 1000 metres of
fabric dressing along with a huge
screen displaying surreal images.
According to the press release,
there will also be '...oversized
transvestites, bondaged dwarves
and costumed dancers emerging
from giant scissorlifts.' Ahem.
Tickets are available now from
selected HMV stores and Tower
Records stores. They are also
available from Ticketmaster on
0990 344 4444.
