SPORT 10 October 1997
World Championships a
breeze for sailors
Chris Balding (Physics III) and
Andy Smith (Materials III) returned
from Canada this summer with
plenty of trophies and memories to
shout about. Both of them were
competing in the British team in
the "Mirror Dinghy" World
Championships on Lake Ontario at
the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour,
Kingston. Against tough competi-
tion from eight different nations
including Australia, South Africa,
USA, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and
japan counting a total of 100
boats, Chris and crew Nikki Harper
walked away with the title with
Andy and crew Robyn Still in a
credible 28th.
The winning pair sailed a con-
sistent ten race series never finish-
ing outside the top ten, winning
two races and two "day series".
However the result was not decid-
ed until the last race when rivals
Ross Killian and crew Darren
McCann (IRL) and Dave Gebahard
crewed by his son Joshua (GBR)
needed to win with Balding outside
the top eight. At one stage this
looked possible with Killian in sec-
ond and Balding in ninth but the
race ended with Killian in second,
Balding in sixth and Gebhard in
seventh.
The British also narrowly beat
the Irish to the team prize of the
highest place top three boats with
1st (Balding), 3rd (Gebhard) and
6th (Ian Capener crewed by daugh-
ter Fay).
Sailing club commodore, the
dynamic Simon Keen, was quoted
as saying, "This was a superb result
and hopefully the publicity will
attract more aspiring sailors to our
(cabin) door."

News
There really weren't many actual
matches going on, but there
were many, many team-trials.
One club whose trial was a
superb spectacle was IC AFC
where many potential stars
showed their stuff to the
enthralled onlookers. It's not too
late to try out for the biggest and
best football club at IC as there is
another trial this Saturday. If you
are interested in playing, at any
standard, then come to Beit
Quad at 12:30 with boots and
shin pads (and shorts, socks and
a T-shirt if you can manage it).
Team captains - get any
interested team members to the
Felix office on Tuesdays at 1 pm
for the sports meeting. Also,
please bring any results into the
office.
Cheers, SI.

Bishop takes Queen shock
Last week the chess club's 1st team,
Middlesex League Champions for 1995/96
and 1996/97, started the new season with a
comfortable win at home against International
Students House. Such was our superiority that
a walkover was likely, but careless play left the
scoreline at 6-2.
Jon Hastings was unable to make any impres-
sion against a tired opponent who could hard-
ly keep his eyes open and looking at the board,
so a quick draw was agreed on board 1.
Natasha Regan won with an overwhelming
attack on the king's side. Rob Lothian
manoeuvred his pieces badly and allowed his
opponent to get a very troublesome extra
pawn, which proved to be his downfall.
On board 4 captain Dom Goodwin spent a
lot of time thinking only to reach a dull mid-
dlegame. To liven things up he tried a compli-
cated tactic which led to a tricky ending. His
opponent lost his queen and ran out of time
on the same move. Nick Moloney played
against the incredibly ugly and hairy
"Kobollocks" who won a pawn but failed to
press home his advantage. Nick pushed his
own isolated pawn on to promotion and
"Kobollocks" resigned. Chris Greenshields
swiftly obtained a crushing position and easi-
ly defeated his clueless opponent.
Gavin Knott got into a very dire position
indeed, but somehow survived and the game
fizzled out to a draw. Easily bored, Dave Tang
spent only 30 minutes at the board during the
3-hour session. Which is probably why his
offended opponent refused to resign and
instead forced a pointless continuation.
Chess problem: White to move - how can
he take advantage of Black's awkward posi-
tion?
