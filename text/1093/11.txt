^^^ they said. But
M Wk two hours of sound-
checking and a can-
celled Live TV interview later, /on
Trout and Rob Timson were hav-
ing a chat and a bevvy with the
great radio gurus and Shire
Horses founders Mark Radcliffe
and the Boy Lard.
Jon Trout Are yous nervous, lads?
Mark Radcliffe We weren't ner-
vous before we started sound
checking, but we're absolutely
bricking it now.
Jon The original artists of the bands
that The Shirehorses cover; what
do they reckon of it all?
Mark Most of them have seen it as
a kind of tribute, and well inten-
tioned and that. They have to see
them that way 'cos we wrote them
first. If they don't let us have it
we'll tell the true story. We've had
a couple of people who've said 'On
Yer Bike Lads', including Hanson...
Jon There's a surprise...
Mark Yeah, big surprise; well, if you
can't say that someone is a preco-
cious little get without them getting
uppity...
Mark 'Lard' Riley Well they're a
precocious little get.
Mark Enough said. I think that we
were a bit close to the bone there;
and also, the Chemical Toilet
Brothers wouldn't let us do it.
Jon &. Rob Timson Really?
Mark That.sujlrised me. That did
surprise me. You know that blonde
one in the,;. Chemical Toilet
Brothers.
Jon Yep.
Mark Ugly bastard, him. isn [ In-1
in
about ten years time you can see
his hair going at the side and he's
going to look like one of those bus
inspectors isn't he? Right obnox-

them .

rhem saying that we could, em...

we still had nothing on
Debbie Harry. She

of Gin and Tonic
be on one at the moment. He's
doing all right. Difficult question. 1
like what he does on the telly more
than he ever did on the radio, but I
didn't hear that much of the radio,
so I'm not the best judge. Is that
diplomatic enough? He's done the
deed, he's achieved what he want-
ed to achieve, lots of quids in the
bank, lots of birds, he's done well.
Jon I don't know if you heard the
Breakfast Show the week after
Diana's death; Kevin Greening was
on and, well, we weren't fans of
the way he did it. 1 was wondering
how you would have handled that?
Mark Well, I didn't hear it, 1 never
listen to the radio when we're on
holiday, because a) It's a like a bus-
man's holiday b) just in case they
are better than us. But, you know,
we were deemed sort of unsuitable
to broadcast to a nation in national
mourning, but I genuinely think that
we would have been all right, you
know. We're not funny anyway, so
when people say we could have
cut out the jokes, it's easy.
Lard There's none there to begin
with.
Rob So you were told that you
couldn't go on then?
Mark No, what we were told was
that Kevin Greening had handled it
all so ^sensitively and had led the
audience through it.
Rob Did rifishite... he ripped the piss
out of her so much when she was
alive an ere.
Lard Well, vo.i know. It was a diffi-
cb sort of thing TO go thio igh
Radio One dignity was right at the
forefront, and so if they did make a
bollocks of it then everyone would
it, and
...vay at
the time and they tried to get in
touch with us to see if we wanted
to come back in the thick of it. 'c.o\
it was the funeral on the Saturday.

wouldn't come in on the Monday

wouldn't have done that.
Mark T
< lit' fair to "cm. rhev : ok
the safe option with Kevin
Greening, but, I can't say I honest-
ly blame them for that. Although it
turned out there might have been
another agenda...
Lard Aye.
Jon So what is the story about the
Breakfast Show?
Lard We're not doing it anymore.
Mark We are not leaving, we've
been forcibly ejected... The
absolute truth of it all is that we
were going to do the afternoons;
we really enjoyed the nights, but
we were doing it for three and a
half years, and it's long enough to
work nights, and it's long enough
to do the same show, and so we
were going to go onto the after-
noons, and then Chris Evans left,
and Mathew Bannister phoned and
said 'will you do the Breakfast
Show?' and we said 'No'.
Jon And then they offered you a big
sack of cash...
Mark Yeah, to be absolutely hon-
est, yeah, it was partially the fact
that is was the biggest show in the
country, and you think, you know,
well maybe we shouldn't turn it
down, and it was also money, it
was greed. It was pure greed on
our part. We had done it before,
but we didn't want to do it.
Lard And also, Mathew, who's
always really been behind Mark,
when he came back to us, he said
'I would treat it as a real personal
favour if you would do this for me'
and it was a bit hard to say no.
Mark But then, we were aware that
they weren't that happy with it in
terms of the audience, but the tim-
ing of it was-iia, surprise, I'll say
that... j g j £ j

Rob I think that the comedy
worked better with the pauses as
well. Did they complain about dead
air?
Mark Well, you know, they are
frightened of it, and we had to put
music under it when we were talk-
ing which we never did at night.
One criticism that we got was that
our audience was selective; if you
liked it, you really liked it, and we
were quite proud of that, but get
judged against that [The Evening
Show] but it is finished and what-
ever happens we will never go back
and try to recreate it.
Jon All the time that you were on
the radio, who was your favourite
guest?
Mark [long pause] Kylie Minogue!
Lard We liked her...
Mark No, our favourite guests were
not big stars, but people we had a
rapport with at night, and the
names that spring to mind particu-
larly would be; Stuart Maconie,
Katie Puckrick, Will Self in the early
days, and Simon Armitage. Those
were probably my big favourites;
Mark Kermode, because we used to
have a laugh. We felt that the rap-
port that we shared with them was
passed onto the listeners as well.
We kind of quite miss that in a way,
more than anything else. It was just
like seeing your mates really.
Jon Who was the most pissed per-
son who's ever been on the show?
Mark Now then, I would think that
Debbie Harry, she was hard work,
she was absolutely slaughtered.
Laid Steaming, weren't she...
Mark She'd had j;,a gig at the
Manchester Apollo. Can you think
•ore pissed
than Debbie Harry? She didn't

you were really pissed... [laughrei |

when • e- was
going (he first time. Second time
we was \\\ muckers and third time,
J just couldn't speak
'cos DAVID BOWIE had
been talking to me and
I just couldn't say
anything for about
half an hour
fucking hell, we went out for a
curry with him. I'm past all that
now, but the first time we met
Bowie, me and him [Mark] were in
New York, it was like we were sit-
ting in front of the headmaster a
bit; it was like he's arrived, but I
think that he was a bit star struck
with us as well [laughter].
Mark It was amazing, cos the
night before we did that in New
York 1 was sat in the studio working
out all the questions that I was
going to ask him, and I thought
'God I can't believe it, I'm going to
talk to David Bowie in this room'.
And we did the programme and it
was great, and we went through it
all, and afterwards I phoned me
wife who was in England straight
after the interview and she asked
'How did it go then?' and 1 just
couldn't speak 'cos all the nerves
that I'd suppressed just flooded
out 'cos DAVID BOWIE had been
talking to me and I just couldn't say
anything for about half an hour.
Jon What were you doing when
you were our age?
Mark How old are yer?
Jon Twenty
Rob Twenty-two
Mark Weil when I was twenty I was
at University in Manchester...
Jon ...doing?
Mark English & American Studies...
Jon Oh dear....
Mark [mock out rage] you what...
[laughter]...:
and 1 was doing what
students . in a band
from time to lime. When I A*as
twenty two I was working at
Piccadiily Radio as a trainee pro-
ducer, doing an Indie show and
giving the ciicket scores between
the re.

at twenty two I was a pot collector

Mark Me And My Baretta?
Rob Yeah that's the one; that was a
fantast c record, but I didn't think
Mark You know I liked that Big
Black Cloud and things, I liked a
few things off the album...
Rob It seemed novel on Me And
My Baretta where she didn't use
much vocally, but over the full
album it seemed as if she was
actually limited.
Mark Well most people are; the
thing is that one of the things that I
really miss as well, and this doesn't
apply just to Angel Corpus Christi,
the thing that 1 miss most of all
from the old show was getting
good records and not being able to
play them; I mean the new Ween
album, there's some blinding stuff
on that; and not being able to play
it; and the fact that we can have
this Angel Corpus Christi discussion
is great, because if we hadn't broke
them no-one would have heard of
them and I love that; that we could
play a record and maybe only a
hundred people would be interest-
ed, but those hundred people
would be interested.
Rob They didn't sound like they do
on the album. They sound an awful
lot better live than they do on the
album. And I would also like to
thank you for introducing me to
Man or Astroman.
Lard Oh, great, yeah! [laughter]
Jon Rob and I were down at V 9 7 ,
the two of us, and we were looking
at the T-shirt stand, and Kuia
Shaker had a Peela Tata one.
Mark Yeah, I know!
Jon What do you think of that?
Rob Are you going to see them in
court?
Mark Ah, yeah! Well, we wanted to
put Ta la on our ililbum, and if
they'd have said nojjlswe'd have
said, 'well, fci enough then, we'll
have the percentage Irum your
merchandising!' So that one nevei
Jon How much time do you think

preparing any of ours... I'd think
that you were up to about ten oi
