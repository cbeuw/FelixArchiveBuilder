News in Brief..
The Union's desperate need for
increased space was addressed by
Eric Allsop on Tuesday in a presen-
tation to the Union Executive
Committee. The presentation,
created for the Beit Development
Committee, describes pressures on
existing facilities and possible solu-
tions.The greatest pressure points
were highlighted and the President
noted that "expansion of social and
recreational space within the col-
lege has not kept pace with stu-
dent numbers since 1960". Next
year the opening of the BMS build-
ing and the resultant increase in the
student population of nearly 25%
will worsen these pressures.
The impending removal of the
Biology department from Beit
Quad to the new Biomedical
Centre in 1998 will vacate much of
the space in the Beit building. Most
of this is due to be converted to
new student rooms, but there are
some areas, particularly the base-
ments, which are unsuitable for
accommodation. It was recom-
mended by the Rector's Working
Party on Social and Recreational
Space that the Union expand into
this available area, a move which
College has all but guaranteed.
The suggestions made in the
presentation for the use of the
basement include changing and
shower facilities, storage facilities,
Felix, STOIC, IC Radio and the Print
Unit as well as new amenities the
Union does not have at present
such as a laundry room.
Substantial changes and reloca-
tions within the present Union
Building were also proposed,
including a new lounge and can-
teen on the first floor and a mezza-
nine level in the gym to house the
offices. The project aims to
improve the and rationalise the
building for administration, clubs,
meeting space and ents. Eric
Allsop said that dBs was always
intended to extend into the space
occupied by Felix and the Print Unit
and this is a great necessity. When
comparing it with similar student
unions "dBs holds 250... the aver-
age size of a venue is over 850".
It is unlikely that the College
will provide money for develop-
ments in the current space and the
time to complete the renovations
was estimated at about 5 years.
The expansion of dBs into the Felix
and Print Unit is provisionally
planned for summer 1998.
The presentation will be given
again at the Union Council (the
large student committee that gov-
erms the Union) on Tuesday 14
October at 6.00pm in the Union
Dining Hall. Council is open to
everyone at Imperial College.

CLAYPONDS
THEFTS RESTART
The desktop part of a computer
and a hi-fi system were stolen
from a student's room in
Clayponds on Sunday night. The
student's room was on the
ground floor and the victim had
only used a small domestic lock
to fasten the window shut. Extra
locks have been added to all the
windows of Clayponds' ground
floor rooms as the domestic lock
supplied with the windows are
not sufficient to prevent thieves
from gaining direct access to per-
sonal possessions. It is believed
that the culprit comes from a
nearby council estate.
This is the third incident to occur
in as many weeks involving some-
one with no affiliation with
Imperial College being able to get
in to Halls of Residence. This rais-
es the question of whether the
new dog patrols and increased
security measures are having an
effect on criminal activity at all.
However, students are being
urged to be vigilant and lock win-
dows and doors securely when
they leave their rooms.
POLICE DIFFUSE
FAIR TROUBLE
The militant Islamic group,
Hizb-ut-Tahrir visited Imperial
College Freshers' Fair once
again this year, despite the ban.
Setting up their stand just out-
side the entrance to Beit Quad,
three men from the radical
group handed out booklets and
papers telling of the Koran and
"The Massacres of Algeria to
Slaughter Islam as an Ideology
and a System". They appeared
at the start of the Fair and were
only told to leave by security at
around 5.00pm after a com-
plaint from the Biology depart-
ment. Two police constables
were called in to give an extra
emphasis and the group, made
up of graduates from LSE, UCL
and Westminster Universities,
disappeared swiftly.
EQUIPMENT
Although the Freshers' Ball was
enjoyed by many of those who
attended the first big party of the
year, it was marred by the theft of
a tape deck and graphic equaliser
from one of the rooms being used
for dancing and music in the
Union. The items belogned to the
Dramatic Society and were worth
an estimated £ 1,500. The thieves
removed numerous screws to
release the units from the racking
and stole the equipment at
around 4am as the Ball was wind-
ing down and the Union Staff
were closing up. However, the
equipment reappeared in an
unmarked box at Beit Security
Office at around 7.30pm the next
day.
NEW AGENTS
The Imperial College Union
Newsagents on the Sherfield
Walkway has just received a
complete overhaul. The small
shop was poorly designed and
run-down, but the new layout
should allow for better circula-
tion and improved stock dis-
plays. Although the newsagents
is open, the work will not be
completed until next week.
BLOW FOR
BELEAGUERED
BOOKSTORE
News has just reached Felix that
the college-run Southside Shop,
located below the Southside hall
of residence, has begun selling
stationary products. This is in
direct competion with the IC
Union shop on the walkway, pre-
viously known as the Bookstore.
In a controversial move last year,
college administration awarded
the tender for the new bookshop
in the library to Waterstone's. It
then forced ICU to halt book sell-
ing, removing their stock by com-
pulsory purchase. The store had
been bringing in about £70,000
profit annually, all of which was
invested in the Union.
