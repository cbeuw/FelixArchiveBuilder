oul Blade is quite simply the
best combat game for the
Playstation, with the tiresome
hand-to-hand combat being re-
placed with swords, axes and dag-
gers. From the beginning this game
oozes quality, and as the jaw-drop-
ping intra roles well past 2 minutes
you realise that this game is special.
Soul Blade is a perfect arcade
conversion, made possible since
Soul Blade uses Namco's System
11 specifications which are fully
compatible with the PlayStation's
hardware. The outcome is an
incredibly responsive game, the
characters move like lightning and
respond to your every whim! The
speed is even more suprising when
each character in each combat
scene can take up almost half the
screen. Taking into account the 3D
environment it becomes even
more mind boggling.
After playing Soul Blade,
Namco's Tekken series seems slow
and sluggish, much like your first
boring lecture. Despite the limited
number of characters in Soul Blade
learning those important moves
and combinations takes time, but
there is a practice mode which
allows you to configure your oppo-
nent to do certain moves.
There are six different game
modes to keep you interested but
the most notable is Soul Blade's
story book mode. You take control
of a character and travel around
the globe on an adventure, in order
to find this special sword that has
some importance with each char-
acter. This part of the game allows
new weapons to be collected
which can then be used in the nor-
mal arcade and battle modes.
Fast, flashy and enjoyable
sword combat at its best. H

WIPEOUT
Psygnosis m m
M
any of you out there may
have just bought a Sony
Playstation, and Sony's
price reduction earlier this year
could have been the main reason.
When the Playstation first came
out the only game to own was
Wipeout - probably most success-
ful launch game ever. Wipeout is a
racing game with a difference: anti
grav vehicles and weapon pick-ups
adds a new dimension. There are
two reasons to buy Wipeout: firstly
it's re-release has brought the cost
down to £20 (quite frankly that's a
bargain for any console game) and
secondly it's damn cool.
Wipeout is the definitive mix of
dance music and adrenaline induc-
ing gameplay. Orbital and Chemical
Brothers have contributed to
Wipeout, while it's main sound-
track was written and produced by
Cold Storage. Sony even deemed a
Wipeout music compilation CD a
worthwhile release.
The game is challenging, how-
ever - the six tracks need a lot of
practice in order to reach high in
the rankings, and a further six
tracks await experienced players. If
you enjoy racing games an ana-
logue Negcon joystick will bring on
a whole new experience. H
