SUMMER ROUND-UP (PART 2)
MUSIC & FILM 10 October 1997
Summertime, and the living stays easy...
In part 2 of the summer albums
round-up, we will be introducing
you to even more essential selec-
tions of the summer's music.
Main thanks is due to your
favourite reviewer and mine, Norm,
who provided most of this week's
esosteric cuts. So, here we go
again...
The Beta Band Primal Scream Travis
Champion Versions
Headed by the magnificent "Dry
the Rain", this stands alongside
"Loaded" and "Lazarus" as a clas-
sic slow-bum epic.
Yo La Tengo Mogwal
I Can Hear the Heart
Beating as One
A sublime combination of Sonic
Youth distortion and folky
melodies, ranging from three
minute pop classics (Sugarcube) to
eleven minute wig-outs (Spec
Bebop). The unsung saviours of
American rock.
Mu-Zlq
Lunatic Harness
Drum and bass, techno, ambient
wibbling and big tunes from Mike
Paradinas.
4 Satin EP
Scottish gods of noise worship at
the church of feedback. With top
tunes.
Sasha & John
Dlgweed
Northern Exposure 2
The first one of these was absolute-
ly mind-numbingly brilliant so this
one, by default, will be good.
There seems to be a penchant for
od German Techno here and this
helps to make this one of the best
trance moments this year.
Vanishing Point
A collection of brilliant tracks from
Bobby Gillespe. A fine return to
form after the dissapointing Give
Out But Don't Give Up and with
new recruit Mani providing a cool,
thundering bass. The singing may
be a bit dodgy but it still impresses.
The 'Scream
look ready to
rumble
Good Feeling
Some are hailing these young lads
the new Oasis. It would be a
shame if they were forced into a
specific style right now and not
allowed to develop on their own
way. Happy, uncomplicated and
sheer unadulterated fun.
Paul Weller
Heavy Soul
Some people really slated this
album. Make up your own mind.
Guided bv
Voices
Mag Earwhig LP
Should have been the summer
album, in the same way Slanted
and Enchanted wasn't either.

FILM REVIEW
Little House on the Welsh Prairie
HOUSE OF
AMERICA
Starring: Steven Mackintosh, Sian
Phillips, Lisa Palfrey, Matthew Rhys
Director: Marc Evans
Debut independent films
usually seem to be high on style
and low on content. House of
America manages to avoid these
traps and successfully reflects the
harsh reality of being born into a
town with no prospects and no way
out.
It's based around the Lewis
family - Sid, Boyo and Gwenny and
their eccentric mother, Mam. They
live in a small wooden house in a
part of South Wales that bears an
uncanny resemblance to the
sweeping plains of North America.
The father left them years earlier
when he fled to America and so Sid
and Gwenny dream of earning the
money to join him. The impossibili-
ty of this is masked by inventive
fantasies in which they imagine
themselves on the American fron-
tier with the aid of drink and drugs.
Boyo is more realistic, however,
and sees his family self-destruct
around him while he learns more
about the truth behind his father's
departure.
Depressing stuff indeed. But
this version of Edward Thomas'
play focuses on the imagination of
the children rather than the hope-
lessness of their lives and is more
upbeat than you'd expect. At times
I found myself looking at my watch
due to the slow plot development.
However, the aspirations of the
main characters are contagious and
overall this is a likeable film and an
impressive debut by the director. CI
