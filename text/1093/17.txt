INTERVIEW AND VIDEO
Released today, House of
America is an endearing low-
budget film which tells the tale of
a family trapped without a future
in a bleak Welsh village. It
movingly portrays the despair felt
by the impoverished young in
small towns everywhere, and
shows how this can lead to a
downward spiral which ruins
lives. The film, reviewed on this
page, marks the debut of Welsh
director Marc Evans and Felix
caught up with him for a cup of
tea and a chat...
Felix: Are you worried that the
public has had enough of Wales
after Twin Town?
Marc: Not at all. Making a film
about Wales is like making a film
about being thin - so what?
Besides, the feeling of not being
able to escape from a hopeless life
is felt everywhere; in the Welsh val-
leys, in England, all over the world.
Felix: Are you worried that it
will be seen as just another Britpop
film full of music by the likes of
Blur?
Marc: As for the music, it was
just a case of what seamlessly fits
into the film whilst reflecting the
characters' view of America. For
Mam, for example, an old women
whose view of America is dominat-
ed by Las Vegas and glitter, we had
music by Tom Jones. For the kids

whose view is of endless highways
with the car stereo blaring we went
for the corresponding type of
music, like the Prodigy. If the music
we could afford on our 1.3 million
budget happened to be popular
stuff all the better.
Felix: How common do you
think is the kind of dreaming we
see from the kids in the film?
Marc: Hard to say. Everyone
imagines they're in their own film
sometimes. When a bloke is in his
Robin Reliant speeding through a
Welsh valley he starts to think he's
starring in his own film, on a Harley
going across America. Alternatively
he just pops his pills, gets pissed
and escapes from the monotony
that way.
Felix: What's the reaction been
like so far?
Marc: Very good. It's been
shown at several festivals including
Edinburgh and it's gone down well.
We're taking it over to Hamburg
next month and are hoping to get
spotted by a big US distributor
some time. 1 reckon there's a good
market over there for real indepen-
dent films like House of America,
especially as they have a similar sit-
uation to the town in the film in
many of their areas. Whatever hap-
pens, I'm proud of my film and any
success is a bonus, Q
RED SHOE DIARIES:
AUTO EROTICA
Video Retail. Â£12.99
It's not often you
see erotica for
woman in the video
section of HMV. But
the Red Shoe Diaries
is exactly that - a
mainstream series
shown in America
which is aimed solely
at women instead of old men in
dirty macs. And best of all, it stars
that famous Seeker of The Truth,
David Duchovny.
The series, released over here
last week, consists of stories linked
only by Duchovny as Jake. In Auto
Erotica, Jake has put an advert in
the lonely hearts column of his
paper and receives replies from a
variety of women who describe
their love lives in explicit detail.
This may sound like the usual late-
night dodgy stuff but it's very dif-
ferent. If anything the scenes are
built up too slowly, with too much
flashy camera work and dialogue.
Still, it's probably the right sort of
thing for a Girls' Night In. |J
Thanks to the generous
people at Vision Replay Ltd we
have two copies of Auto Erotica
to give away. The first two
females in the Felix Office on
Friday will win one and don't
worry, we'll deliver the prizes in
plain brown envelopes.

ODEON
KENSINGTON
This week the Odeon is offering five pairs of tickets
to see Nil By Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary
Oldman. Produced by Luc Besson, this semi-autobio-
graphical account of a family growing up in a rough
South London council block certainly pulls no punch-
es. The bleak reality of lives ruined by every kind of
addiction is shoved in the viewer's face at every
opportunity, as is the domestic violence suffered by
the main character's wife.
The film is based on Oldman's experiences of
living with an alcoholic father, something that led to
him being an alcoholic himself for twenty years. Nil by
Mouth will definitely affect you one way or another, be
it making you walk out half way through or wanting to
change the world when it's finished. It's a rare film that
is brave enough to discomfort the viewer this much.
To win one of the five pairs of tickets drop your
name and the answer to the following question into
the Felix Office by midday on Tuesday:
One of the producers of Nil By Mouth directed
Gary Oldman in two recent films. Name the
director and the films.
The winners of last week's competition who knew)
that Sigourney Weaver is starring in next month's
Alien 4 are:

Reuben Connolly

Marie-Eve Bizien
Columbia must be IV^ti
regretting signing up Alicia '
Silverstone to produce and star in
two new films. The first, Excess
Baggage, was released last month
and flopped badly, leading to sug-
gestions that the studio should cut
their losses and drop the young
star. They're keeping faith with
her, however, believing that they
have to be seen as "talent friendly"
if they're to attract the top stars to
similar deals.
New studio DreamWorks is
also sulking after its first film, The
Peacemaker, performed far worse
than expected in its initial two
weeks. After grossing a disappoint-
ing $ 12.3m in its first weekend it
dropped to just $8.3m last week,
leaving it third in the box office
charts. This coincides with critics
beginning to turn against the film's
star, George Clooney, as they sug-
gest his cardboard acting is
restricted to shy sideways glances.
Things are not looking good for the
ER man after successive flops with
Batman & Robin and One Fine Day.
Last weekend's American Top
Ten looked like this:
1. Kiss The Girls $ 13.4m
2. Soul Food $8.4m
3. The Peacemaker $8.3m
4. In and Out $8.1m
5. The Edge $5.2m
6. LA Confidential $4.5m
7. The Game $3.1m
8. U-Turn $2.6m
9. The Full Monty $2.3m
10. Wishmaster $1.5m
Disney and Fox are preparing
for a showdown over the latter's
new animated film, Anastasia.
Disney is determined to remain
the number one cartoon studio
and so is pre-empting Fox's film by
re-releasing The Little Mermaid
two weeks earlier. Fox chairman
Peter Chernin is not happy, com-
plaining that "Disney is determined
to do anything they can to stop the
success of Anastasia." It's not the
only thing Chernin has to worry
about. Titanic, the most expensive
film ever made, is set for a world-
wide release in December, mean-
ing it will be an anxious Christmas
for Fox's executives. O
