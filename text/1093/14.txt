Patrick Duff,
obviously not too
pleased with his
Felix review
S
trangelove's eponymously
titled album, has arrived at
an apt time, with the whole
"new grave" scene flourishing with
the likes of Radiohead, Mansun
and Placebo leading the pack.
Superstar introduces the
record, an attempted anthemic
effort that never reaches the
heights it is trying so hard to
achieve, a trend throughout the
whole album. Yes, it is dramatic,
yes it is emotional, but it lacks any
sort of dynamism, and fails to cap-
ture the listener's attention. They
may have pretentious of becoming
a stadium rock band playing
majestic and awesome anthems,
but even praise from Ed O'Brien of
Radiohead cannot change the fact
that the quality of this album is akin
to a hopelessly cheap imitation of
Suede's mic-slapping energy mixed
with an attempt at Smiths-like
depressing prose. If you were
thinking of getting this album on
the merits of its singles, don't, just
take a listen to anything from the
Smiths back catalogue instead. Q

unk-pop is a curiously
diverse genre. It has pro-
duced some of the most
inspiring, energising songs of the
last two decades, and seems to
cover everything from Teenage
Kicks to Girl from Mars. I would
even argue for Jane Weidlin's Rush
Hour or Echo Beach by Martha and
the Muffins. The two bands every-
one agrees on are The Buzzcocks
and Husker Du, both
Filled with a burning anger that
could only be expressed through
chainsaw guitars and close harmo-
ny screaming. Sadly, these two
groups are responsible for a legion
of trailer-trash bands recycling the
same old formula to produce an
insipid, washed-out facsimile of
the passion which drove them to
pick up their guitars in the first
place. To piss on the graves of your
musical heroes seems like a poor
way to pay them tribute. To
exhume their corpses and parade
them like trophies is downright
rude.
And so to 30 Amp Fuse.
Despite having fifteen songs
crammed into forty minutes,
someone forgot to tell them that
even a two minute song needs
ideas. That's the whole point of
this music, to make a smash and
grab raid on the listeners heart and
then get the fuck outta Dodge. On
/ Fall Down they're almost there,
but end up
Seeming more peeved than
furious. And Stereogram, with it's
bouncy Ash-a-like chorus, would
certainly be great live but sounds
so thin and weedy here that it
blows away before you're really
hooked. Many of the lyrical themes
are equally tepid, from the mun-
danity of Smallville (look, we know
it's boring working in a gas station)
to the unrequited love of someone
who clearly deserves nothing less
than rejection {For You). Even their
rehearsal space gets it's own spe-
cial ode on Blastin' Room, while
recent single Punk Virtuoso is no
more than adequate. So sod this,
go and buy Husker Du's Flip Your
Wig instead. H

Pleased To Meet You * * v2
s ' >-y
Louise looking
very "pleased to
meet you"
S
leeper has its own distinctive sound: quirky
lyrics; which almost seem like random words
taken from the backs of cereal boxes and
20th century prose; and Louise Wener's incredibly
sexy coarse voice. Their first two albums Smart and
The It Girl followed this trait, and with their success of
these two albums Pleased to Meet You seems like an
experiment into different styles, pushing and empha-
sising the melody but in no way have they sold out and
gone pop.
The track Miss You has a worryingly almost coun-
try and western feel to it, while the following You Got
Me has a solid indie sound, strong electric guitar and
drums. The beginning and end tracks on the compact
disc have that familiar Sleeper sound, (with Wener
shouting the words out with full gusto) so at least it
starts well and finishes as it started.
To deny this slightly different sound is to deny a
band the chance to evolve though I am glad evolution
is a slow process. To review an album is to compare it
to a band's previous work and, admittedly it is differ-
ent. The only reason to buy Pleased to Meet You and
justify parting with a precious fifteen pounds is to have
enjoyed Sleeper's previous albums and to hear
Louise's familiar voice. So in the end Pleased To Meet
You is nothing amazing, not enough to become a must
buy but it will please all Sleeper fans. H

E A T STATIC
Science of the Gods
• • • •
For me, Eat Static will forever
provoke memories of a dark,
smoky room, filled with drapes,
dead cheese plants and festering
cups of tea. An appaling copy of
the Abduction album on the half-
buried, ramshackle old stereo with
five and a half speakers at random
places in the room, but the beats
cutting through despite. All the
better because we were, well,
fucked.
And all this is, in a way, critical
acclaim for the new album Science
of the Gods. More of the same,
then? 1 suppose so, but that isn't
really fair. Eat Static are one of
those bands who's releases form a
continuing whole rather than indi-
vidual project - only each release
just keeps getting better and bet-
ter. Highly recommended for
those distended late nights when
you don't want to think, you just
want to wallow around in puddles
of bass and BE. CI Jeremy
