"The art of war is of vital impor-
tance to the state. It is a matter of
life and death, a road to safety or
fo ruin. Hence it is a subject of
enquiry which can on no account
be neglected."
Sun Tzu 500 BC

opportunity for you to learn a

the Quad. We are open from 10am
'till late every weekday, so come

HOUSING CRISIS
My sympathy goes out to freshers
unlucky enough to get duff digs this
term - those in Montpelier and
Gardens Halls whose buildings are
crumbling around them, those
sharing rooms meant for one and
those that have to spent eight
hours and twenty pounds each
week travelling to and from the
Clayponds Village of the Dead.
Imperial College's accommodation
has never really been top-notch,
but with the new halls planned for
Beit Quad, Linstead car park and
the sports centre roof still years
away from completion, things are
going to get worse before they get
better. Sadly, those in private
accommodation are likely get an
even worse deal - a study just out
shows that average London rents
have doubled in just eight years,
and even even expensive rotten
basements in Kilburn are hard to
come by.
NATIONAL CURRY
DAY
It's true - 10 October has joined
the ranks of spurious festival days.
The question is - can ICU curry bar
cope? They sold 40kg of rice on
Monday, 55 on Tuesday, 60 on
Wednesday...

Apologies for confusion, and par-
ticularly to Rob Clark, for errors
appearing on page two of issue
1092. The first part of the story
erroneously claimed that ICU
lacked a Deputy President for
Finance and Services. In fact it
has one - Rob Clark - but it lacks
a Deputy President for Clubs and
Societies.
