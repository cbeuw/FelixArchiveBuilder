On the morning of the France v England international
the 1st team defeated Nottingham University at Harlington
by 6 pts to 3 . From the start the I.C. pack asserted
i t s superiority and the three-quarterswere well served
from the scrum. She tackling of the I.C.backs has shown
some improvement of late and the wings,when given the
ball,looked dangerous. Nottingham opened the scoring
with a penalty goal, but after this I.C. dominated the
play Spooner touching down for an unconverted try i n
the corner. I.C. continued to press in the second half
the match being decided by another Spooner try.
The 'A' XV,after a hard match, jus* failed to holB
the Vickers Armstrong's team- being defeated by 6 pts
to 3. However the 'B' XV bewildered the Vickqrs second
team and won by the magnificent score of 30 pts to n i l .
Fillmore played his usual b r i l l i a n t game.
RIFLE CLUB.
This year the olub i s yet again having a highly success-
ful season and has done well in both the leagues and friendly
matohes.
In tha London University league they have 3 teams in the
premier division and the 'A' team has won a l l its matohes to
date, and Is well on the way to retaining the Engineers Cup
for yet another year.
In the Inter-University League the 'A' team again met
with suooess, and apart from losing to Cambridge, beat every
other university i n tho country, and so for the seoond time
in 3 years the I.U.L. Cup returns to I.C., the only college
in the competitions. This has been achieved only by good
shooting and a great amount of luck.
The 'C* team was formed experimentally at the beginning
of the year, so that members oould obtain matoh practice be-
fore entering the other teams. This team has shot exceed-
ingly well and is at present second to London 'C in its
division.
The friendly matoh with the Metropolitan Police ended
favourably, but they are awaiting their revenge when we visit
them in the summer.
'A' Team. I.H. Abbott, J.M. Alexander, C. Bentley, B.C.
Cope, FA. Lemin, T.H. Read, J.R. Ryder (Capt.) & S.P.O. Jasainger.

In recent weeks the I.C. Judo team have fought two of
tho more important provincial universities. These were
return matches from the Winter Term, when I.C. managed
to win both without much d i f f i c u l t y . This terra, howev-
er, both opponents were in s t r i c t training for a Vars-
i t y match, and the scores were more even.
At Oxford the f i r s t I.C. man became rapidly airborne
- the result of two stomach throws. Cruse, Hodwell and
Macpherson evened the scoring with taiotoshls, harelg-
oshis, and kamlshlhogatarles. Burford made some good
though unsuccessful ren-raku-waia-migi-tsurl-koml-ashls.
The result waa a win to I.C. by 6i points to 6.
When Cambridge came up last Saturdaythey round a rather
depleted I.C. team. Seth did well to draw against a
higher graded opponent, whom he had worried with some
strong seolnage attempts. Williams was swift with okurl-
aahi-harel but waa f i n a l l y sat upon by a larger opponent.
Rotgana aoored quickly with his usual oaotogaria and
Maspherson brought some d i f f i c u l t haraigoshls, the
f i n a l score being Cambridge )pts.,I.C. ipta.
