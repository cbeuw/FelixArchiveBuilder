Whan your correspondent want to Interview the
Chairman of the Athletic Clubs Committee he had
to Invade the wilds of the lew Hostel, where he
found his subject in bed. "Charlie" Chester was
Buffering from flu, after, we suspect, an excess
of athletic pursuits. Though I t may not be sur-
prising since he spends his working hours i n a
constant temperatuse room i n the Bessemer Labor-
atory, which can only be entered through an a i r -
-lock.
Juan Stanhope Chester was born In a small f i s h -
ing village with a Spanish flavour i n the Isle of
Uan. This start gave him a touch of the romantic
whioh Is possibly the key to his character.
"Charlie" went to school at King William's
College i n the Isle of Uan. He rose to prominence
as a member of the 1st X.V and the athletics team,
and he actually became a College Praepostor. After
a year i n the Navy he came to I.C. and studied
metallurgy. Again he soon became noted i n rugger
circles and has played for the R.S.U. and I.Ci
teams regularly aver sinoe. Ha has also appeared
in the University tiam,
After a season as Vice-Captain of the I.O.H.F.C.,
he wan elected to control the entire (porting
a c t i v i t i e s of the oollege a i Chairman of the A.0.0.
Like many Mines men "Charlie" has travelled
extensively and been i n many d i f f i c u l t situations•
On appearing In an H.S.U. blaier and a cloth cap
in Montreal, he was mistaken for a Russian Naval
offioer and nearly arrested. In Spain his vigorous
participation in' Fiestas i s noted, particularly to
the point of bathing f u l l y olothed, thus showing
oareful regard for the Spanish laws on the subjeot.
The romantlo influence i n his l i f e i s demonstrated
in his likes and dislikes. Of the former he quotes
"huntln", shootin1
and f i i h i n ' " ; poetry, a major
passion, he ie a noted deolalmer of euoh eplos as
"The called of lakimo Nell", and also the important
subjeot of drinking. His tastes In this dlrsotion
are beer and aguadiente. as for d i s l i k e s , he l i s t s
a series of female types. Those who cannot dance,
talk shop while wearing evening dress, are arty-
orafty, eat gsrllo and l a s t l y show bad taste i n dress
espeoiallyin the wearing of short shorts when ob-
viously not suited to them. This of course
Immediately leads to the woman he doss l i k e . In

Although he has taken no pains to disguise his
Christian names i t was natural that "Charlie"
became known as the namesake of the celebrated
"Cheerful Chester". Our version of the Chester
exerts the same influence of good humour over his
surroundings and does much to smooth the path of Union

This year's tJHUUKl "Rosette" Bally saw three entries from
Guilds Motor Club. Tony Holt, the captain, partnered by
Andy Levins l a the 'Red Devil', Norman Denison and Mike Pell in
a Delia*; sad the writer, In the absence of his usual team -

The "start* oonaiated of sending a telegram to Bally H.Q. at
Basingstoke from Kensington Poet Office in the late afternoon
then belting tmc that same H.Q. as fast as mind and matter
eould allow.
In the company of 60 other oar-loads of crazy people, we
sat cut soon after 8.30 p.m. faced with the task of crossing
every railway Bridge between Basingstoke and Winchester and
oolleotiag oode-nuafcera on the way. During this we met a
marshal, Ian Smith of Chen. Tech., who was seen again several
hours later trying to unwrap his Fraser-Mash from a telegraph
pole before the locals discovered their loss of oommunloation.
Due to the liberal application of highly polished ice,
and the attendant blifsard, David's A.O. took to the hedge-
rows and ditches with the say abandon usually associated with
inveterate inebriates. Having crossed all our bridges many
time before we oame to then, and collected sundry other re-
quired Information, we returned to Basingstoke Just before
midnight.
The nexjj seotion was a 1 The 40 minutes allowed for
plotting was a gross underestimate,and we were many minutes
late setting out. The section consisted of observing details
en signposts, letter boxes, eta., the points being located only
by*long sad detailed computations. Then oame the first "in-
cident*. The A.O. became completely cut of control, and
crashed Into the deepest part of the ford. This was soon
followed by "Incident" number 2 when the writer nearly fell
out at 50 m.p.h. due to his door opening suddenly. This was
not, as alleged, a deliberate attempt to leave the party'
"Incident* number 3 - David discovered that the only way to
stop an one sharp bend was to go straight on and ram the hedge,
a feat obviously tried, Judging by the beh&ggled state of the
hedge, by several othnr drivers.
these incidents failed to remove the outward

nest one, No. 4, whioh was the backing of a large wall Into

Tasuf to vacate his rear seat in favour of the author, remak-

Brian now took the wheel, while I navigated and we set

It was indeed ourtainsI Four Maohanloal Engineers used the

Sony Holt oame along and was informed of our plight. After
a two hour wait help arrived in the farm of a Standard 10 with
a tow-rope and a fast 90 m.p.h. run-on-tow brought us to
Basingstoke, where we saw Tony setting off for his last seo-
tlon.
A broken cam-shaft proved to be the cause of the trouble,
so we trooped back to London, by car and train. It was than
that the writer, being an interloper, had a strong feeling
that his colleagues attributed the night's ill-luck to his
presenoe.
A round up In Queenie's on Monday morning showed that
Tony had lost a rear wheel, Herman and Mike had had a fairly
suooessful, i f chilly, evening, and that the Guild's President
is s t i l l a good navigator. Thus ended an extremely danger-
ous, though In retrospect Interesting, rally and - i f anybody
