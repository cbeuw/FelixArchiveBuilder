THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL C O L L E G E
EDITOR": JOHN FE3LEY. C i r c u l a t i o n : 1200
A different name will appear at the head of this
colunm in the next issue of FELIX. Mr. Peter South-
gate has been elected to be the next Editor. Mr.
Southgate is well known to FELIX readers already from
his drawings and contributions as PAES. He carries with
him the best wishes of the retiring Editor.
In writing this kind of departing note one finds that
there are so many people to thank that i t i s difficult to
begin. First and foremost are the FELIX Board :-
Paddy Clark, John Pownall, Alex Fraser, Geoff Grimshaw,
John Bramley, Roger Sykes, Mike Turner, B i l l aidson,
David Hattersley, Bob Fillmore, Trevor Huthen and Julius
Kosky. ffithout their hard work FELIX would never
out at a l l . Thank you, one and a l l .
In addition there are our regular salesmen, and
saleswomen too, and the kind people who come alomg on
Sundays to help. Then there are the people really be-
hind the scenes, the young ladies from the L.C.S., and
elsewhere, who so patiently type for us; and 'S'll Vous
Plait'. Indeed FELIX i s fortunate to receive so muoh
goodwill from all sides. Long may he continue to do so.

\Jx In the past few Issues, several prov-
*n oking statements and articles have appeared
in FELIX. I t i s significant, however, that
there have been few letters i n response.
People are not writing to FELIX these days,
out he i s a kind animal and i s only too
pleased to l i s t e n to your worries and grum-
bles.
-J' The manner i n which Mike Neale conducts Union
Meetings with the maximum efficiency has already
received appraisal. The l a s t Union meeting i n the
physics lecture theatre was no mean example of
his technique. There was only one thing wrong -
he was wearing the President of I.C.V.A.'s gown.
Congratulations to Mr. McChesney for being the
f i r s t on his feet to point out the error. How
many people had spotted i t ?
j j ^ Perhaps Messrs. HcChesney and Duff should be made
•Herbs-in-Ettraordinary' for the purpose of, as
Mr. Duff put it,"chasing up the architect".
•jfc I t i s rumoured that Old-Selkirkian C l i f f James,
the eminent (?) mining geologist, w i l l be return-
ing to his haunts again i n S.Rhodesia pretty soon.
He spent much time i n Cumberland last term.
Another O.S., Anton Brown, had his departure for
Canada reported i n professional journals three weeks
before he l e f t .
Instead of i t s usual theatre—and—buffet annual
outing, the Hockey Club decided to hold a Binner
this year. Held on Thursday 24th, the dinner was also
attended by Captains of the U.L. and U.C. teams, and
was a great success. There was much conviviality i n
the Bar afterwards, everybody buying the Captain a
drink i n order to t r y and get included i n the H o l l -
and Tour this Easter. Many darts were thrown, and
some managed to find their way to the board.
i l i Two weeks to go for the Easter play by the Dram.Soc.,
'^and Miss Jean Osborne had yet to have a single rehea*-
-sal. She was too busy training her prompter.
Many contestants i n the recent so-called 'Triangular'
Boxing Contest between Mines and Guilds have been
seen sporting excellent black eyes. A notable specimen,
a monument to his endeavours, i s being worn by Dick
Janes, ex-President of the Mines. R.C.S., who with-
drew from the contest are inconspicuous but for their
l i t t l e white flags.
|^ FELIX now has a beautiful new typewriter. I t has
a l o t of knobs and buttons which are considerably
mystifying the s t a f f but, although several type-
writers are used i n making up this paper, we reel
that the standard of print w i l l be raised.
* To quote the DAILY TELEGRAPH, Dr. Heywood, of
the Imperial College of Science and Technology
has been selected to s i t on a Solar Energy Comm-
ittee i n Phoenix City, Arizona. Is he sure that
this IS a Solar Energy Committee - and not a
dastardly attempt by the Second Year Mechanicals
to dispose of him amongst the underworld of that
c i t y ?
The Organisers of the Lord Mayor's Show have
invited Guilds to submit a float. I t i s expected
that the appropriate subcommittee w i l l produce
b r i l l i a n t ideas for a theme.
v K For those who have d i f f i c u l t y with the Judo
"/N reports on the sports page, here i s a glossary:
Ren raku waza - follow through technique.
Tsuri koml ashi- drawing ankle throw.
Okurl aahi haval - aweeping ankle throw.
Osotogarl - major outer reaping throw.
Talotoahi - body drop.
Seolnage - shoulder throw.
Baralgoshi - sweeping l o i n throw.
Kaalshihogataal - upper four quarters hold-down.
Tery picturesque.
we'11 see you at Clarldge's on March 25th.
