The Conservative and Socialist Societies and the
S.C.M. together organised a brains trust on Colonial Af-
fairs on Thursday 17th. An impartial Chairman was pro-
vided by the International Relations Club, and the panel
consisted of Mr N. Macpherson, Conservative M.P. for ICum-
fries, Mr J. Johnson, Labour M.P. for Rugby, Mr J. Morgan,
Press Secretary to the S.P.C.K., and Mr R. Mukerjee of
Lincoln's Inn. Only two questions were submitted in be-
fore the session began.
Pretty well all the colonies were covered by the
juestions, and i t was amusing to see how the two M.P.s
tried io ilagnify their differences of opinion. Mr Morgan's
forthright analysis of the unrest in Africa was masterly.
Kenya, Malaya, India, South Africa, the Falklands, the
West Indies - all were examined in the short time availa-
ble, and provoked much thought*

The cries of "Dozey-do .... Honour your partner
.... Allemande left.." wert; to be heard in the Snaok Bar
until 10.^0 p.m. last Friday. It was all over the attempt
of the International Relations Club to promote Anglo -
Amerioan understanding. It started on Thursday with an
I.r..C. - sponsored General Studies Lecture which must have
come close to setting up a record - i t lasted until 3»20
p.m. - and finished with square-dancing on the evening of
the following day. Prof Newell1
s lecture attracted an
audience of 120 who gathered to find out 'How the Ameri-
cans Got that Way.1
They found out. The lecturer showed
how the European and African roots and the early rugged,
pioneering enviroment of the Americans all contributed
to T

The 'American Evening', with the square-dancing
preceded by films and a short talk on music (by a Cana-
dianJ ) was thoroughly enjoyed by all present and high
spirits were maintained until the end. It is hoped to
have more people attending these functions in the future
and many who are not normally attendant would do well
to change their habits.

The ring, hired from an outside firm, had appeared
in the Snack Bar as i f by magic during last Tues-
day afternoon. For the f i r s t time i n the history
of the Rector's Cup the tournament was held under
the auspices of the A.B.A. who supplied the o f f i c i -
als. This combined with the spirited crowd that
watched and the even more spirited boxing (?) of
the contestants made the evening a delightful and
memorable one.
The Mines won by shear weight of numbers; R.C.S.
were able to produce only three, perhaps four, box-
ers and withdrew from the contest; Guilds could enter
only eleven boxers against the Mines' twenty-two.
Of the nine fights between Guildsmen and Miners,
Guilds won five. The following are the individual
results:- (Miners f i r s t )
T. Aitken beat U. Best, (pts.); T.M.Kesjel
beat J.Chapman, (stopped 1st round); R.Lowson lost
to R.Fillmore,(stpd 1st rnd); J.Reynolds lost to
A.Palmer, (stpd 1st rnd); B.E.Lowes lost to H.McKen-
zie,(stpd 1st rnd); B^B.Young beat M.Gray,(pts).
R.Kingdon lost to J.Baker,(pts); H.Huckin beat P.
Southgate,(stpd 2nd rnd); H.Ramstad lost to h.
Corbett,(pts); the pot for the best winner went to
R.Fillmore.
There were also three bouts between Miners gain-
ing them the s i x points which won them the match.
Two exhibition bouts were given by members of Batt-
ersea Boxing Club to demonstrate how boxing should
be done.
The boxing was entertaining i f not b r i l l i a n t and
the referee showed great discretion i n stopping the
bouts before anyone got hurt too much. One contest-
ant was heard to say to his.opponent "My God, I'm
tised" half way through the f i r s t round and then to
ask "What's the score?" after going down for the
second time. Incidentally, Mr. Southgate wishes to
contact the man who said " Box man, box " as he
picked himself off the floor.
HUmore based Ms usual brilliant bout.

On Monday of last week honour was satisfied between Messers
Pultaney A Co. of South Kensington, and FELIX of Imperial College.
One oold winters day many years ago the sign-board shown in the
pictures earns to live in the FELIX cupboard. We never knew
exactly how i t oaae there, probably i t walked; at any rate that
is our story.
The day we took i t back was oold and windy, 30 we did not
wait around for very long. The picture on the left
shows the sign-board being placed on its hook. . The Asst.
Production Manager i s doing the re-banging, helped by the Advert-
ising Manager, while the Business Manager and the Editor look en.
the despairing hand belongs to the Features Editor, who is l i t -
erally supporting the whale venture.. Our other picture shows
amicable teres being restored between Pulteney and FELIX.
