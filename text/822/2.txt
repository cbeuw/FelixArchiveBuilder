AUT boycott The results of the
Association of University Teachers
(AUT) ballot on Wednesday made
it clear that the Union sees a boycott
of examinations as the only way
they can highlight their claim for
higher wages.
It is in many ways a sad decision,
for if the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals 'calls
their bluff as Nigel Baker suggests,
students will be very badly affected.
Nevertheless the fact that
academic places are becoming
progressively more difficult to fill
highlights the need for higher wages
for University Teachers.
The question remains whether the
AUT could n't have chosen a less
harmful way of proving their case.
Islamic Society I have had a
succession of members of the
Muslim faith expressing their
concern over the front cover of the
Christmas issue which depicted a
copy of the Quoran adjacent to a
bottle of whisky.
I would like to point out that there
was no intentional significance to
the positioning of the book and the
bottle next to each other and
apologise for any offence caused.
Thanks to David Smedley, Doug
King, Sez Wilkinson (apologies for
hacking your story), and Steve
Mayfroidt for putting together this
emergency fly sheet. Thanks also to
all the staff who turned up to the
FELIX party and made the radio
show such jolly good fun
particularly Neil Motterham for
looking after the technical bits.

Mr Jackson is reported to have
told the Joint Planning Committee
of Court and Senate of ULU that the
students of ULU would not fight
student loans, on the grounds that
it v.as politically evident that they
would hnppen anyway.
Vice-Presidents of ULU, Louise
Van Der Straeten and Nicola Jones,
who claim they have suffered
continual personal abuse from Mr
Jackson, were 'absolutely stunned,'
at his statements to FELIX and said
claims that the issue was a 'personal
conspiracy' against him were
'absolute rubbish.'
The 'no-confidence' motion was
defeated at the last GUC by two
votes. The President, Vice-President
and Honorary Secretary of IC Union
voted against the motion.
Nigel Baker told FELIX that he
voted against the motion because he
did not feel their was sufficient
evidence for Mr Jackson to be 'no-
confidenced', and he did not have
time to check the facts behind the
motion before the meeting. He now
claims that had he known more
about the situation he might have
voted differently. He admitted that
Mr Jackson had 'shown a lack of
efficiency' and said that had the
motion centred around Mr Jackson's
incompetence it would probably
have been passed.
Mr Baker told FELIX that he sent
a 'personal' letter to Mr Jackson on
December 13 pointing out the fact
that he no longer supported him,
but both Mr Jackson and the ULU
post room have confirmed that such
a letter has not been delivered. Mr
Baker was unable to explain why the
letter had not been received.

Kathy
Union Assistant Administrator,
Kathy Tait is leaving IC Union today
to be with her boyfriend, Alan
Hepper in Farnborough. Kathy
came to ICU in September 1984 as
receptionist under President Ian
Bull, after working as a hotel
receptionist at the Onslow Court
Hotel, Queensgate.
In her time at ICU she has worked
with Union Administrator Jen
Hardy-Smith and Union Typist Pat
Baker, who she described as
'Godsends'. She went on to say that
she had made a lot of friends at IC
who she would miss a great deal.
There will be a small leaving party
for Kathy in the Union Bar this
evening, anybody who knows
Kathy can pop along.
A busy term of spin turns, cuddle
holds, straddle jumps, slows,
quicks, bruised toes and lots of
laughs had its highlight in the
annual London Ball, which was
hosted by the IC Dance Club on the
26th November. We welcomed an
excellent turn out of Imperial
dancers alongside students from as
far afield as Cardiff for a friendly
evening of general dancing and
informal competitions. We took a
rest from our efforts on the dance
floor to watch a vibrant professional
demonstration of Latin-American
dancing by our own team coach,
Vicky Cunniffe, and partner Lee
Williams. The evening provided this
term's beginners with a good
opportunity to try out their new
steps and was a pleasant informal
prelude to the more serious inter-
varsity competitions next term. We
are grateful to Grant Thornton
Chartered Accountants for their
sponsorship of the event and
Letters
Dear Bill,
I am writing to express my disgust
at some of the points of view being
proposed in this publication. I was
incensed by the mean, petty, selfish,
and money-grabbing attitudes held
by so many of the students of this
most prestigious college. I do of
course refer to the issue of student
top-up loans.
While there still exists in this
country, the illiterate, innumerate,
and those in gravest poverty, I
cannot accept that higher education
Dear Bill,
Its comes as a great occasion to
share our homage to a great
historical messenger, Christ Jesus,
on this gracious occasion of
Christmas. Along this great spirit,
however, there has been an act of
great sin and rancour which has
hurt and offended the feelings of
hundreds of Muslims at the College.
This is about the sketch which
depicts our Holy Book, the Quran,
along with abominable items which
are not only incompatible with the
Holy message of the Quran, they
are strictly outlawed. I believe that
jyou had earlier declared that FELIX
'will not publish anything
presentation of the prizes.
By the time of publication the
Club will have held an end of term
Barn Dance on December 13. The
Club's rock 'n' rollers will be
heading for town after classes in the
last week of term to hit thefloorat
the '2 IV rock club on Tottenham
Court Road.
Classes have gone well this term.
Two additions to the timetable have
been the jazz and Latin-American
classes. The joint ballroom and Latin
classes have been operating at the
levels of beginners, intermediate
and advanced, and next term we
shall be starting a new beginners
class at 6pm on Tuesdays in the JCR.
Next term will be a busy one for the
teams with competitions in
Sheffield, Cambridge and
Southampton. We also have a rock
'n' roll evening to look forward to
in the Great Hall in January,
incorporating the National Student
Rock 'n' Roll championship.
is a right. It is a privilege!
I am sickened at the ceaseless
carping, by certain factions among
jus. How can they be so ungrateful?
In my opinion, these people are not
deserving of places at an
establishment such as this.
Therefore, I applaud Mr Kenneth
Baker's proposals, and would
encourage him to go further, and
make all student finance in the form
of loans.
Yours,
Duncan McKenzie, Physics 3.
'offending'. This particular act is not
only extremely offending, it is
inexcusable, and considered utterly
immoral by the muslims.
It is hereby, requested that the
person responsible for this mischief
may be removed from the
publication and activities of the
Phelix (sic) and a possible enquiry
be conducted in this matter.
We do hope that you will take up
a stand of justice in this matter and
deal with it accordingly.
Yours sincerely,
Members of IC Islamic Society,
