weight to Prof John Caldwell's promis-
es of level funding and clinical stu-
dents' priority at Wilson House. Not
everyone was happy, particularly at
ICU, where officers felt that deals were
going on behind their backs. Alex
Feakes wrote in 'that editorial' that
"ICU and the College have been neatly
side-stepped by a room full of baying
medical students...", and became high-
ly unpopular 'over in Paddington'.

It's election time! An adequate
crop of eight candiates stimulated a
high punter turnout, with the first of
the dreaded New Electon victories as
president. Final results were unpre-
IC University Challege Team in cloning row.
Delegates from the Dearing
Enquiry into Higher Education
funding attended an open meeting at
ICU to get some intelligent student
input to their report. Particularly dis-
appointing was Sir Eric Ash's refusal
to recognise the misery that a
£10,000+ graduation debt can cause.
He repeatedly compared student
loans to a mortgage, failing to grasp
a) that you can sell a house, and b)
you can't fail a mortgage.
Electrical Engineering received
top marks for their teaching targets in
the HEFCE assessment scheme.
Estates were yet again in the lime-
light when a large sheet of glass was
sucked out of the Civ Eng building
by high winds and plunged down to
the pavement, completely decapitat-
ing three students who mercifully...
And still with Estates, the new
Health Centre was completed nine
months behind schedule. "No-one
anticipated how much noise the work
would transmit ..: so we decided to

In case you're a claustrophile with a

Hindu Kush, The new DP (F&S) is
Rob Clark , and DP (C&S) will be
filled by Smita Chaturvedi. Felix will
be run by own iron hand, sanity per-
mitting.
An overhead projector belonging
to Safety Officer Ian Gillet was up to
no good, when it posed as a bomb.
Being rather large and heavy, it had
itself delived to the Sherfield security
desk and deliberately sat about look-
ing ominous. Futhermore, it had cho-
sen to conincide its prank with the
visit of a former Northen Ireland
Minister. It was firmly disiplined by
Ken Wier, Security Chief and PC
Clive Coleman.
Birkbeck College, part of London
University, gave in to underwhelm-
ing demand and closed their Physics
Department. Hie remaining students
transferred to UCL. Other universi-
ties seemed set to follow.
Ridiculous quantities of cash were
raised by St Mary's students on their
annual circle line pub crawl - nearly
£20,000 in one day. Rumours that the
medics threatened passers-by with
arcane surgery were unfounded.
ICU President Eric Allsop was
thoroughly duped by a cunning
King's College kidnapping caper.
They initived him to attend a meeting
allegedly condidering disaffilliating
from the NUS and ULU. He was
unfortunately returned unharmed after
ICU paid a £50 ransom to King's Rag.
The Overseas Student Committee
came under fire for their poor
finances. They are responsible for
funding the Union's overseas clubs,
but failed to produce any budgets by
the deadline. A Council no-confi-
dence motion was defeated on the
grounds that it would make things
worse. Piers Williams gave them "a
very big slap", and sent them to bed
with two-thirds funding.
Imperial College revealed its very
own secret garden behind Weeks
Hall. Larger than Princes Gardens, it
is available to swipecard wielders
from 9am-6pm, unless it isn't; the
grounds are sporadically locked or
full of children, ensuring continued
obscurity.
In the dying hours of the term,
dozens of black-clad mourners gath-
ered in the bleak sunlight. The
funeral march accommpanied the
cortege as it proceeded around the
college, grieving the tragic demise of
the Union bookstore. For maximum
effect, the train paused outside a
goveners' meeting and traipsed
through the Senior Common Room.
Last rites were read by Rob Clark
before the corpse was layed to rest in
the bookstore window.
IN APRIL... NOTHING.
IN MAY...
Students returning after a holiday
of hard revision were treated to a
good hard slap in the face from the
Estates Department. Yes, I am talk-
ing about the great tent debacle.
Anyone who still doubted where
Colleges' priorities lay had it spelled
out to them in this April Fool's joke
that wasn't. As January said, "I can't
fucking believe it!".
The general election came rather
too late for A B A , College's new
reprographics contractors. They went
into receivership just months after
opening. On the bright side, many
clubs had their photocoping bills
written off.
New election 'ron'ped home once
more, as the only remaining candi-
date on voting day, Clare Bunston,
was heavily defeated. Here we go
again...
No Joy for Clare
Two of the candiates standing for
the post of the new Imperial College
School of Medicine President were
rejected on 'academic grounds'. The
election was delayed and will take
place this week. The winner will
technically represent all of the IC
medical population, although
Charing Cross and Westminster
already has a sabbatical president.
Things may get interesting.
Imperial held third place in the oh-
so-important Times league table.
The score was hindered by a poor
accommodation rating (67%) but IC
came out top on staff/student ratios.
And so we reach June. Our previ-
ous issue is probably still kicking
about on your bedroom floor, so I'm
not going to review it. It's not nostal-
gia until its at least a month old. The
final issue lies in your hands right now
and the rest is, as they say, future.
Enjoy your news-free summer.
