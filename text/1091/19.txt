IC cricketers are, typically, caught down the pub
An IC Select XI met on Saturday to
play a friendly against Gray's Inn, in
what has recently become an annual
event. The Gray's Inn are an
extremely tidy pub side made up
mainly of lawyers, and they remain
unbeaten this year after playing many
of the Oxbridge constituent colleges.
Captain Dawkins got us to
Harlington after mishaps with the
minibus keys and traffic snarl-ups on
the M4. He then went out immediate-
ly to inspect the pitch and amazingly
win the toss again for the fourth time
in a row in a spookily Athertonesque
manner.
Usually we play our first XI against
these opponents but due to imminent
exams and projects our select XI was
drawn up giving a first cap and
rounding the cultural education of
Dan who is more at home back in the
USA playing baseball.
It was decided that we should bowl
on a decidedly sticky wicket - after
overnight rain - and an outfield that
resembled the Sahara, after being
sanded just before we arrived.
Mandar and Nigel opened the
bowling with Nigel picking up an
early wicket. But with a near-gale-
force wind blowing down the wicket
Mandar found it difficult to bowl
into, as did Dave with his spin and
Barry with his legspin - neither of
whom found much movement and
what there was was very slow. A
two wicket stand built up 130+ runs,
but when this was broken we regu-
larly took wickets. They finished
with 215 for 6 off their 40 overs.
With Mandar finishing with fig-
ures of ten overs 56 for 1, Nigel was
his usual economical self with nine
overs 23 for 2, Dave bowled nine
overs 46 for 1, Barry six overs for 33.
Phil, who bowled the final overs with
Nigel, bowled six overs 42 for 2 off a
run-up that started at twelve paces
and finished at twenty five plus, gen-
erating a lot of skidding pace.
So came our innings and after a
shaky start we were at 36 for 4. Nigel
and Mandar, who was promoted
from his self-appointed no. 11 spot to
no. 6, settled the shop and embar-
rassed the top order by between them
putting together ninety plus runs.
Mandar was eventually run out on a
sharp single for 34, another record
broken, he could have done with
those glasses earlier in the season.
But we were well behind their run-
rate at this time and in trying to make
up the deficit the tail soon were back
in the pavilion, especially Dave who
under orders from Barry, coach for
the day, "to slap it about" did so and
hit the first ball hard and high for the
fielder to make an extremely good
running catch at deep mid-on.
We finished with 162, Nigel fin-
ishing with 65 runs plus his econom-
ical 2 wickets he surely was the man
of the match once again.
A good time was had by all and
thanks must go to the captain's
father, who came to watch him play
and ended up as umpire for the day.
He also bought a jug, along with
the three from our hospitable and
generous opposition. We enjoyed
ourselves and there was Barry's
thought-provoking conversation.
Sports short
Two IC fencers, sportsman of the
year Edward Rysdale and our very
own Felixer M o Mansoori, have
been selected for the British!
Universities team to tour Saudi
Arabia for two weeks this summer.
Hope you both do yourselves justice,
you lucky swines.
