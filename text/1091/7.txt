FELIX WEDNESDAY 1 8 IUNE NEWS REVIEW 7
and Chelsea Sir Nicholas Scott
when he hit the free booze a little to
hard and ended up dazed in the gut-
ter. His local party did not, and he
was duly expelled.
Arachnaphobes were apalled when
it transpired that a Selkirk Hall resi-
dent had been fostering a pet
tarantula. The secret was only
revealed when live crickets intended
as dinner escaped into a re-app's
shower cubicle.
Estates were back in the news with
their bizarre 'Garden on
Enlightenment' plans for Dalby
Court. Also proposed were a canal
down Imperial College Road, a huge
computer-controlled laser water
sculpture on the Queens Lawn and an
eight metre long geological map of
the U K . And who's paying?
Millennium Commission. Possibly.
The Royal College of Science
Union had their fair share of prob-
lems this month when both the Senior
and Junior Treasurer left. Dr Ann
Mitchell was forced to turn in the post
when College renegotiated her con-
tract. The Junior treasurer, Chris
Bragg, resigned in disgust at the con-
tinual ineptitude of his subjects.
Prof John Caldwell. Scary, eh?
The mood was sombre and philo-
sophical in the physics department
following the death of Professor
Abdus Salani. As well as a world-
leading theoretician, Salam con-
tributed to many cultural causes,
notably the Third World Academy of
Science. He was a Nobel prize win-
ning physicist who proved that ethics
and politics are very much a part of
good science.
IN DECEMBER...
Congratulations were due to the
U L U Karate team, including two IC
students, who won the national
championship. The Kung-Foo Kings
fought off vicious competition, and
'A full-point Ippon in the dying sec-
onds meant that London was now the
U K and European student champs.'
Petty bureaucrats everywhere were
given fresh inspiration by Dr Bryan
Clarke of Wilson House when he
fined several students £10 for open-
ing the front door. The penalties were
introduced unbeknown to ICU or the
Hall Committee, and formed a blan-
ket ban on allowing people to enter
the hall including, it seems, one's
own housemates.
The elusive Medics' Dean Prof
John Caldwell (no relation) was
finally pinned down by students at St
Mary's. In a two hour face-to-face he
pledged support for continuing the
high subvention (>£80,000) that the
two large medical schools receive,
rather than dropping to the less
impressive £12,000ish they could
expect as a CCU. Priority was to be
given to medics at Wilson House, he
agreed, but did not concede to sepa-
rate clubs and bars after the merger.
There was another black-eye for
Schal when a workman had his jaw
tec
smashed by a large iron gate. The
gate hit him when a large timber and
concrete frame fell onto it. The frame
fell over because it had been hit by
another frame which was hanging
from... can you guess? A crane.
IN J A N U A R Y . . .
"I can't fucking believe it!", was
the phrase of the month when Prof
Alan Swanson revealed that the
Bookstore contract had been award-
ed to Waterstone's, not ICU. College
forced the Union to stop all book-
sales in direct contravention to the
Memorandum of Understanding.
Worse still, it is believed that
Waterstone's did not submit the
cheapest quote, and the panel failed
to consider the benefits of keeping
the money within the college. Alan
Swanson gave us perhaps the juiciest
quote of the year; "College hasn't
shot itself in the foot, just maybe
shot the Union."
A cool million went missing from
the College Student Finances Office.
Research grant cheques expected on
the 20th December were delayed due
to bad weather affecting the courier.
It seemed to disrupt his vision as well
as his speed, and when the cheques
did turn up, they were delivered to
the Royal College of Art. The errant
funds were finally tracked down in
early January by a relieved registrar.
Always quick off the mark, the
Union Sabbs organised an
'awareness blitz' to inform students
that they don'tjust sell beer and books,
just beer. Ooh I love being nasty.
Still more thefts plagued the col-
lege, this time it was the clever and
sensitive parts of the Press Office
computers. Production of IC
Reporter was hindered, and employ-
ees struggled to complete the four-
page fortnightly newssheet in time.
Final year biochemist Richard
Parker tragically hanged himself
after causing confusion in Southwell
Hall. He had been setting off alarms
and posing as a Fire Safety Officer in
Southwell Hall when he was placed
in charge of a security guard.
However, the guard, apparently
intoxicated, released him again
whereupon he returned to his girl-
friend's flat and committed suicide.
No clear reasons were given.
Richard's suicide is one more death
on a sadly long list, raising questions
about the levels of academic pressure
applied and support provided to IC
students.
Rain stopped play in the beligered
library extension project. Water
seeped into a main distribution box,
blacking out the library and much of
Sherfield. Problems problems prob-
lems.
IN FEBRUARY...
It was Prof Alan Swanson's turn
to face St Mary's students. He added
IC's Karate Kids Godwin Unkere and Edwin DoSantos
