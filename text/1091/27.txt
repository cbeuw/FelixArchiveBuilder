[Antonio]
What is the meaning of this? I have come across the royal fields to duel with thee and
that is what I shall do.
I will not fight thee, fool. Begone!
Thou willst not insult me! I will fight thee
[Enter Giovanni
No! Fight me, Scorchio.
Giovanni, what art thou doing!
I am here to fight this villian that has stolen my means from me. I began work with
Marcus the bookseller today so that might earn some monies in order that I might live a
decent day. Today I found that Marcus has been told to cease his selling of books by
order of the Duke. They have given the allowance to sell books within the city to anoth-
er from outside.
This is grve indeed! Was not Marcus a generous benefactor, providing greatly for the uni-
versity and those who study here?
Aye, he did. Now, he cannot do so and not only do I have no ducats, but our place of
study has less also. Scorchio was the one whispered silver-tongued into the Duke's ear to
sway his judgement. For that, I will duel with thee, treacherous villain!
Thou art right. I did speak with the Duke on this matter. But the Duke hath stated that
other monies will be made available to compensate.
Aye, and the greater we become the chattels of the Ducal Palace.
My plan worked well, then. I have no regret for what I hav done and I shall have none. I
shall fight thee but say to thee now: I shall defeat thee.
My dear Giovanni, think carefully about what thou are doing. There is no need for such a
show.
Dear Antonio, I must do this for poor Marcus as well as myself. Come savage, and fight!
[Giovanni and Scorchio fight. Giovanni is injured and Scorchio flees]
Sweet Giovanni! Why didst thou do this?
Antonio, there is no need for your sorrow. I have done what needed to be done and I
failed. That 1 accept now and I am resigned to my fate. Soon, the angels will come to col-
lect me and I shall watch upon thee and my other friends until thou will care to join me.
Until then, I say adieu to you all, my friends. Bertolucci, Michelangelo and
Antonio adieu.
[Giovanni dies]
Ah, Heavy day! Why did today need to commence? What have we here in this hallowed
place of study done to deserve such actions from our Duke and patron that even gentle
Giovanni becomes incensed? O dark night, 'tis bleaker today than any other night.
Tonight I shall mourn my friend and tomorrowâ€”tomorrow I know what to do. Come
friends, let us leave this place.
[Exeunt, carrying Giovanni's body]
To this day, I still meet good Michelangelo occasionally and Bertolucci is a waelthy mer-
chant in the Spanish Antillies. Of Scorchio and Arianne, I have heard little since.
[A fanfare and flourish sounds, Antonio leans out the window]
What is
this? Ah. a herald comes to the piazza to read a proclamation.
Hear ye all this. The Duke wished his people to join him in blessing a most precipitous
announcement. I have come to declare the betrothal of the Duke's daughter, the fair
Arianne, to the most noble physician Scorchio. The wedding will be on Midsummer's
Night a month hence. In celebration of the event, the Duke has declared two days of
feasting and amusement at that time
Ah, what justice is this? Scorchio is to wed Arianne. Good Michelangelo will be please
to hear this this! What merriment we shall make. Didst I not say that they were suited t
one another? Indeed they will drive each other insane and kill each other someday. Dear
Giovanni, I hope that thou art listening to this and smiling, for this indeed is the most
comical thing I have heard in years. Finally, I can rest easy in my trouble to avenge thy
death. And now, I go back to my teaching. For years I toiled to complete my degree, but
it did not really aid me in this world. I am glad I completed it though, if not for the
