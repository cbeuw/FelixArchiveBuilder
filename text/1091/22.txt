Come now, young ones. You must understand the meaning of this simple geometry?
When I was studying at university, this was as axiomatic as speach.
Sire, why didst elect to take the tutor's role? They say that this is not a well paid profes-
sion.
Alas, that is something upon which I have mused for a long time no. Tis a long story and
it all began whence I fell in love with the Duke's daughter, Arianne. It is a worthy tale, sit
round all and I shall tell ye.
[A lawn with Antonio cursing the Fates]
Ah, far and wide have my troubles grown. I am betwixt two concerns so stuck that I have
no course of escape. Not only have the Fates decreed that I must under a devilish canopy
my final tests suffer thus inducing my senses to a horrible beating from dainty flowers on
account of their dust and from the seasons and their heat and rain; but I must also suffer
my love for the fair Arianne whom to me is like a star to a astrologer or the book to a
student. A thing of desire so great that I study her soft face as if it were imprinted upon
my brain. Would my good friend Giovanni were here to calm my fever'd mind, to put my
sickly form to a peaceful rest.
But ho, who is this?
[Scorchio enters]
Ah, 'tis Scorchio. a man that hath given
me his previous wrath.
Antonio, the hate I bear thee can have no term that is utterable.
Get ye gone sirrah! Fly back to thy nest across the royal fields, man-vulture!
If thou willst, Antonio, I will duel thee here! The injuries thou hast done me are without
other recompense.
You shall be unto us melded - unified into a whole. That is, thus, your advantage and our
grievance.
Fie! Speak to me no longer! Draw if you are not a coward!
[Antonioparries Scorchio's lunge.
Giovanni enters]
How now, Giovanni?
Antonio my friend. And who is this? Scorchio! Art thou not a physician from across
the spacious royal fields?
That I am.
And what is your business here?
I am here to confront your friend Antonio, though it is no business to be here.
That would reason why your rapier is thus drawn. But tell me Scorchio, what has your
mind so vex'd that you must upon Antonio relinquish your anger? Can it be that he has
injured you in some way and you are unable to perform your duties?
Nay, the reason is far more awful. I have from my allies heard that he has his affections
unto fair Arianne fix'd.
Arianne is mightily worth his affection. She is fair and lovely, a true beauty amongst the
rough cattle that dominate these parts.
Indeed, sir. I come to challenge Antonio for her favour.
Thou art affected by her also?
Yea, 'tis true. But enough sentiment. Come, wretch, and fight.
[Scorchio raises his blade again]
Scorchio, away, be gone! I have no time for your bickering. I must my finals in yonder
tent sit.
Shame on you coward, I shall return. But know this: Arianne shall be mine - thou canst
erase her visage from your memory. Hah. I am away!
[Scorchio exits]
Giovanni, what a to do! If I am to pursue my love for Arianne, I am surely dead! If I do
not then I must in eternal longing remain.
Fear not, dear friend. Michelangelo has intervened on your behalf. He has talked with
the lovely Arianne and arranged with her a tryst upon which you must decide.
