[Antonio] Oh happy day!
[Giovanni] And Arianne has agreed most intently. Now come, let us to the tent.
[Exeunt
Scene 2 Giovanni and Antonio join the line entering the tent and meet a confident Michelangelo.
At the door a clerk is entering candidates in a ledger]
[Michelangelo] Giovanni. Antonio, hast thou heard the news? Hieronious the Seer has said this day that
the elements will let loose a furious squall of hail and thunder. This does not bode well
for us.
[Antonio] That is true, for the noise that shall make will no doubt be distracting upon those within
the tent!
[Giovanni] Methinks that this rigid tent was erred upon.
[Michelangelo] Not so much err as er.. For this idea was rested by an architect cunning enough to build a
place of study for the likes of Scorchio.
[Giovanni] Look now, it it our turn.
[They reach the clerk]
[Clerk] Your numbers please gentlemen.
[Michelangelo] [Aside]] spot some fun here my friends! [To the clerk] My number sir, now let me
think. I have it about me somehow.
[Giovanni] There it is Michelangelo, tucked in your cuff. Thirty-six it reads. There!
[Michelangelo] Thanks kind Giovanni, It is a number true. Will it do?
[Clerk] Is that your number sir?
[Michelangelo] Why 'tis mine. Look I have it, therefore 'tis mine.
[Clerk] But is it your number sir? I must have your number to enter here!
[Giovanni] I think that perhaps the worthy refers to your candidature, Michelangelo. Your number
there, that I have just lately found, looks to me now some other figure. Thirty-six. What
could it be? Ah there on the reverse 'tis writ in bold.
[Michelangelo] "Ede and Ravenscroft"? Why of course, 'tis my robe, a fine a gown as there ever was don't
you think?
[Antonio] Though lacking a fur, methinks.
[Clerk] So this is not your number?
[Michelangelo] Yes it is, but not the one you want. I have another.
[Clerk] "Ninety-three-o-sixteen", 'tis more like it. There it fits!
[Michelangelo] Thanks be. Now where was I? Oh yes. Scorchio...
[Antonio] Speak not that name unto me
Michelangelo!
[Giovanni] Enough of the complaints, friends. Where is Bertolucci? He was concerned about this
test was he not?
[Michelangelo] Aye Giovanni. You have spoken prophetically, here he comes.
[Enter Bertolucci red-faced]
[Bertolucci] How now friends.
[Antonio] Bertoiucci. how goes your day?
[Bertolucci] Not well Antonio. I have for three months my notes studied and yet I know not what the
subject means. I fear that I will fail this test.
[Clerk] Do you have a number?
[Michelangelo] You must understand, Bertolucci, that the subject of describing how things occur has no
basis. You must know that our mentors are, all the time, inventing new ideas without due
reason, except perhaps to further confuse us. Then, when they test us, they will do so on
other ideas. So worry not. gentle Bertolucci, for your study so far will not have aided
even if understand it you did.
[Clerk] But it will matter not at all if you don't give me your number!
[Bertolucci] Why does this fool prattle so? I have no numbers left in my brain for anyone else.
[Giovanni] He doth just bark, ignore him so.
[Bertolucci] Speak you the truth. Michelangelo?
[Antonio] Aye he does.
[Giovanni] Come, we must be seated now. I hope that Lady Luck shines on you all today.
[All] Thanks Giovanni.
[All sit and the examination starts. Antonio looks through his paper and realises that he
