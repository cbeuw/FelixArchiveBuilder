[Antonio] Thou art right, I will not. Away Scorchio and take these fellows with thee.
[Scorchio and the Duke's Guard leave]
1 have lost my flavour for a drink. The fight still courses through my veins and gives me
strength. I shall wait for Arianne.
[Bertolucci, Giovanni and Michelangelo enter]
[Giovanni] Antonio, art though in good health? You look a little raged and I saw you leave during the
course of the test.
[Antonio] 1 left for I have no reason for it. I ws waiting here for Arianne when Scorchio approached
me and we duelled. I injured him and he left.
[Giovanni] He will be back, and with greater numbers. Thou must be careful Antonio, the physicians
often band together to protect their own. But now let us to Leonardo's tavern to consider
your tryst.
[Michelangelo] She will meet you. Antonio, do not fear.
[Giovanni] Have you thought about what you are going to wear?
[Exeunt]
[In Leonardo's Tavern. Enter Antonio, Giovanni, Michelangelo andBcrtolucci]
Tell me. whence will the fair Ariannc meet me?
Merely a few moments from now, Antonio. Thou art to meet her by the statue in the
piazza at dusk.
Thanks, good Michelangelo.
Now, let us our attentions turn to the test that we have just undertaken. Didst thou
attempt to conquer the mountain that was -
Nay Bertolucci! Remove from thy mind the
thoughts of such things for they arc well and truly over now and talking of them will
only suffice to give Antonio more sorrow.
Worry ye not, for I shall not be upset by thy conversation. I must now to the statue in the
square. Adieu, friends.
[Exit Antonio
Now, I think 'tis time to begin the merriment of drinking. I shall the first circle of mead
purchase.
Giovanni, hast thou not told me but yesterday morn that thou hast neither monie nor pos-
session that will suffice to call thee anything other than poor? How canst thou, then, pay
for mead for good Bertolucci and myself? Please do not take this burden upon thyself.
Aye, Michelangelo speakest right. I shall then buy.
Fear not my friends! Thy concern touches my heart and if were not in the company of so
many here I'll warrant that my eye would have shed a tear here to see my friends talk thus.
But I have news that may make thee understand. I am doubly happy today - not only have I
my final test completed today, but I have recently been appointed assistant to old Marcus
the scroll-seller. He is paying me a ducat a week for every week of toil that I undertake.
Old Marcus? From him did I all my texts purchase. Indeed he is a worthy man.
Aye. But come back to my former offer - what shall thee have to drink?
Since we are celebrating. I shall drink much. A whole flagon of ale for me!
Aye. two for me!
My friends. I fear a competition is about to begin.
Competition? Nay. Giovanni. Bertolucci can never drink more ale than me whilst the sun
shines in the heavens.
Art thou challenging me. Michelangelo?
Aye, I am.
[Giovanni] Then let the drinking begin.

Scene 2 [Scorchio's rooms]
[Scorchio] Tonight, I shall win the fair Arianne. To Leonardo's Tavern shall I. and there with sweet
word (and with sweet meats!) shall I overcome her. I am fair, am I not? I am clever - clev-
erer than that villain Antonio, no doubt. For what doth he study? He studies how the
earth may over time change its shape what makes it! What a waste of time that is! I, how-
ever, study the intricate arts of how a man may function. Tis a skill that requires a keen
brain and a surgeon's hand that does a job such as mine. Arianne must. then, understand
