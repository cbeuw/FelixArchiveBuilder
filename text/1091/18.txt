18 COLUMNS F E L I X W E D N E S D A Y 1 8 T H I U N E
And now the end is near, and so I
face the final curtain. As those with a
long memory will recall, this is how
last year's final article began, and,
originality being my middle name,
why not trot out Of Blue Eyes' clas-
sic again? It has been, to paraphrase
Ronnie Barker in Open All Hours, a
funny year. Exams in tents, the
General Election massacre, the
Union Election fiasco, young
upstarts interviewing the Rector. I
finally came face-to-face with two of
my long-standing sparring partners,
Ian Caldwell and Mike Hansen. If
you keep them on their toes, they're
really not that bad after all. A few
veneers of Sherfield secrecy were
finally peeled back, and I hope that 1
have shown, as the Rector said, what
a first-class administrative operation
we have here. Not. My regrets, aside
from getting hammered in the
Election, are that I never got round to
dealing with College Catering.
Maybe next year. Just quickly, John
Foster, why does almost 40% of
sales go on staff wages, and how on
earth can you only make £100,000
on £4 million, when you don't get
charged rent or any utilities? I think
we should be told. Given the large,
captive audience and the often exor-
bitant prices, it should not require the
acumen of Sir John Harvey-Jones to
do better than this. We clearly can't,
so why not let professionals do the
job?

Since we have reached the end of the
year, I thought it would be a good
time to revisit the BMS and the
Library exten-
sion, for which I
must again thank
Phil Hilton and
Oliver Clarke.
The outside of
the BMS is near-
ing completion,
with a huge
effort going on
inside. It is really
starting to take
shape and having
seen mock-ups
of the lab, the
medics and biol-
ogists can be
sure that they
will be very
pampered in
their new home.
Shame they're
not going to let some proper scien-
tists in it (only joking, boys and
girls). The Library, amazingly, will
be broadly finished by the time you
read this, with some of the books
being moved in. All in all, it seems
that Schal are doing a sterling job.
What's this, you cry, has Baker been
Voice of Reason
nobbled by the enemy? Months since
he slagged them off. Has Caldwell
got him wrapped round his little fin-
ger? Not on your nelly, missus. Now
I'm not out to do a hatchet job (hon-
est, Ian) on anyone, and will give
praise where it's
due. Not every-
thing in the Schal
garden is rosy, it
would seem. They
may be good at
construction, but
their accountancy
leaves a little to be
desired. Enduring
the SCR slop in
order to eaves-
drop, I heard that
all is not well.
Schal, apparently,
are being audited
on one of their
other projects (the
Royal Opera
House, I think), to
determine the
nature of certain
alleged 'irregularities.' I am quite
sure that such behaviour is not taking
place on the BMS project, despite IC
being a very soft target.
One organisation that is unquestion-
ably pulling a fast one is City and
Guilds Union. The exam photocopy-
ing scam is disgraceful behaviour by
a body that purports to look after stu-
dent interests. What seems to have
been overlooked in this whole affair
is that our exams are copyright.
Commercial photocopying, particu-
larly where such profiteering is
occurring, is surely illegal. If this
didn't appear dodgy enough, it tran-
spires that the cash proceeds were
kept in a safe, rather than banked in
the usual. It does not take the Serious
Fraud Office to detect the mild
aroma of rodents in this sorry saga,
but far be it from me to suggest that
any of the cash could have been mis-
appropriated or used for nefarious
purposes. For my part, I trust the
C & G exec as much as the next man.
So there we have it. That's your lot,
ladies and gentlemen. As most of
you leave for the epic summer break,
some of us will remain and keep the
home fires burning. Thanks to every-
one who has kept with me this year,
particularly those who felt moved to
write. Some of you even managed a
letters-page battle, of the like we
haven't seen for a while; if young Mr
Weir makes himself known, a pint at
Southside and a beginner's course in
journalism await him. As Vera Lynn
once remarked, we'll meet again,
don't know where don't know when.
Goodnight and God bless.
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
F t
After John Major's predictable resignation as
leader of the Conservative Party, made in his first
public announcement after the General Election,
the party has been up to its usual tricks of tearing
each other apart over the new leader. Michael
Heseltine was out of the race literally years ago,
when a heart attack rendered him (at least in his
wife's view) unfit as leader. The minor recurrence
just after the election merely emphasised this
point. With Heseltine out of the way the main con-
tenders were Kenneth Clarke, William Hague,
Peter Lilley, John Redwood and Michael Howard.
Each candidate had hinted in past times that
may have wanted to stand as leader. The battle
had never really- been about what actual person
was standing but what his views on... can you
guess? Europe were. With Anne Widdecombe
putting the boot into Howard's campaign with
reports on Derek Lewis and all the other people he
fired during his time as Home Secretary, this left
the four with any vague chance of victory in the
first round.
Those results were again fairly predictable: in
descending order it went Clarke, Hague,
Redwood, Lilley and Howard. Lilley and Howard
broke a previous agreement that the last two
would support the candidate in third place (they
all knew they would make up the last three) and
supported Hague. This was yet again unsurpris-
ing, as Redwood and Howard have always
despised each other, and they all knew Redwood
would be known as the dark horse who stood
against the leader. And his support among the
public was feeble.
With the second round coming up, the battle
will be a Clarke - Hague match, with Redwood in
the wings (unless he leaves first), and we will be
back where we started: a battle between the wings
of the party. Various old grandees have quietly or
publicly pledged support for a candidate, again on
left/right lines. The right wing of the party resem-
ble Labour's left wing in that they still believe that
the reasons why no-one likes their policies is
because they have not been implemented in their
full extremity - the solution being to move the
entire party in their direction.
One hopes talk of co-operation in a future
Shadow Cabinet between the wings of the party,
despite present hard-line talk (Hague has talked of
a fully Euro-sceptic Shadow Cabinet). If he does-
n't compromise as leader, Clarke may carry out
his vaguely-hinted promise and defect with his
friends to the Liberal Democrats. History may
repeat itself in mirror image of the Labour wran-
glings of the Eighties, when they chose Michael
Foot over the more popular Denis Healey, to keep
their extreme left happy. Anyway, time will tell.
Enjoy your summer.
