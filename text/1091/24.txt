cannot do any questions]
[Antonio] [Aside]'This is indeed terrible device. I have not with my keen eye spied even a single
question that I am able to undertake without fear of being beaten on knowledge. Alas!
how can it be that I. like my friend Bertolucci. shall fail? But hush hurried thoughts,
look at him now, a smile upon his face and his quill scratching his thoughts onto the
thirsty vellum. He knows what he is undertaking. Is it just me here who docs not under-
stand? Can it be only I who cannot scribe even a mark on my scroll? Even my name has
fled! Oh why has the Lady escaped me? I wish I could be akin to that man near the front
for whom this test is but a mild annoyance. He sails through it like an old mariner fol-
lowing the steady North Star who remains fixed upon his target and shall arrive merry
and with ease. To that I am but a fool who is in love with a fair maiden. Ah Arianne.
where art thou? Not thinking of me as I think of you. I'll warrant. But there is hope
there. Did Giovanni not say that good Michelangelo has with Arianne my contact orga-
nized? I am then saved. For even if this doth pronounce me unable to matriculate, I have
my Arianne. But what of Scorchio? Will he hole my plans and thus complete my mis-
ery? Nay I shall slay him before he can any damage unto me inflict. Aye. he shall under-
stand that Antonio shall overcome him.
But hush, a warder this way comes.
Back now, dear heart, back to this test. What oft? Shall I complete it or leave to pursue
Scorchio. Aye that's the rub. That is what I shall do. Beware Scorchio. I come for thee!
But first some lowland courage: I shall away to Leonardo's tavern td collect my thoughts
aproper.
[Antonio exits
Scene 3 Antonio leaves the tent and makes his way to Leonardos tavern where he stopped by the
Duke's Guard with dogs]
[Guard] Young sir, thou art not allowed to enter.
[Antonio] Pray tell me forwhy?
[Guard] I am a member of the Duke's Guard. I have this power and the Duke's Rule, and my new
[Antonio] faithful hound shall help me enforce this.
A dog I see, a faithful hound no. It seems that the beast has taken a dislike to the Duke's
Rule.
[The dog mark s the guard as its territory. The guard fends it off
Scorchio enters]
I think that I shall enter. Your reason has a better in your animal, and my dry throat
the best of all!
[Antonio moves to the door]
[Guard] Stay you sir!
[Scorchio] Turn villain and draw!
[Antonio] Scorchio. thou devil!
[Scorchio] Bring thy rapier to bear and fight.
[Antonio] [To the Duke's Guard] Willst not thou and thy hound come to my and against this mal-
adroit physician?
[Guard] I will not, foul mouthed student! I am here to prevent entry, not to enter to prevent. I
will not assist you. 'tis not my duty.
[Antonio] But what of the Duke's Rule: he wishes to kill me!
[Scorchio] Then send a message to my master and he may arrive in a day or two. The Duke has ruled
me to stand my place and prevent entry.
[Antonio] That is no help to me!
[Guard] Away from here student. There are pretty nobles coming who would not wish their path
sullied by the likes of you.
[Antonio] Then I am lost.
[Guard] Away I said, thou are breaking my concentration.
[Scorchio] Do not run Antonio. Draw thy blade.
[Antonio draws and fights Scorchio. Antonio strikes Scorchio. who falls, injured]
[Scorchio] Thou hast wounded me! How darest thou.
[Antonio] The keenest for the duel speaks of battle wounds? I shall kill you for impertenance!
[Scorchio] Thou hast not the courage. Antonio. Willst thou strike a man when he is down?
