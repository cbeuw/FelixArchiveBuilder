continued from front page
the next academic year, leaving
the present incumbent Eric
Allsop as President over the sum-
mer. Even if a satisfactory candi-
date can be found, the new
President will miss the crucial
hand-over period of training
which normally takes place over
the summer months.
Regarding whether or not the
President's job could be done in
part by the other sabbaticals,
Deputy President elect Rob Clark
stated "There are aspects of the
job that [the Deputy Presidents]
can cover, but ultimately there's
more than enough work for three
people. If three people aren't
there then some of that work
won't be done - This will be
detrimental to students."
Eric Allsop said that this elec-
tion result had "Left a bad taste in
the mouth." and expressed his
regrets that he had not been able
to elect a successor. With respect
to his continung role as President,
Mr Allsop stated that he felt
"...morally obligated to look after
the Union." but explained that he
would have to talk to his PhD
supervisor before making any
further announcement.
Guilds face the music
EDWARD S H E R M A N
City and Guilds Union look like-
ly to make a tidy £2,000 profit on
their latest venture - selling exam
papers to Mechanical Engineer-
ing students at exorbitant prices
(Felix 1090). The revelation
comes after the C & G President,
Guarav Misra made a declaration
of his accounts to the Union
Finance Committee.
Meeting last Tuesday the
Union's team of financial scruti-
neers heard how Mr Misra man-
aged to earn a £2k profit on a
£3,500 turnover. Speaking to
Felix, Piers Williams, Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
commented that the matter "has
been resolved to as satisfactory
conclusion as possible." He went
on to say however that there is
"no way anybody will ever be
able to account for all of the
money."
It appears that no precise
details of the photocopying trans-
actions was kept and that matters
were not helped by the liquida-
tion of A B A Copytech. Sources
suggest that in the final days
before closure, the cash strapped
company was carrying out work
for cash with "no questions
asked" and that receipts were not
forthcoming. One instance is
believed to have involved Mr
Misra approaching A B A with
£450 in cash for a particularly
large job.
City and Guilds' other finan-
cial headache, that of a £700 can-
cellation fee resulting from their
abandoned Easter Dinner, also
appears to be close to a resolu-
tion. With the CCU's creditors
taking the Engineers to the Small
Claims Court, ICU Finance
Committee have agreed that the
original sum should be paid from
C&G's central funds. The
remaining £100 court costs and
interest charges will be met by
Mr Misra and Martin Ayres,
Honourary Junior Treasurer.
Some sources have questioned
Mr Ayres' assertion that the
C & G Senior Treasurer advised
him to make a £200 payment to
the entertainment company. This
is seen as an admission of guilt
on the part of C & G and under-
mining any attempt to avoid pay-
ing the cancellation charge.
