that I am the man she will most desire. I am the superior and that is why I am to be pre-
ferred.
[Enter Kavarkianus
What news Kavarkianus?
[Kavarkianus] Sire. I have a news that is dire!
[Kavarkianus] Yes, pray what is it?
It concerns some news of thy desire, sire
Tis said that she and another will tonight, by night.
Meet by the statue in the square for a tryst, if thou willst.
What sayst thou to all of this mission, dear physician?
[Scorchio] Thy speech is always laboured, Kavarkianus. My surgeon's hands will one day operate on
thy throat to see what exactly is the matter so no others have thy misfortune.
[Kavarkianus] But what of this fresh news, do you muse?
For it can only mean one thing, (may I sing?).
If this gentleman will with her meet, it wont be a feat,
That he should be in such luck, and they shall surely -
[Scorchio] Enough, fool! 'Tis only one man
who canst this do. Fiendish Antonio, I come to slay thee.
[Kavarkianus] What of me. sir? Shall I to the morgue where I live?
[Scorchio] Aye, and make space for a new corpse.
[Exeunt
Scene 3 Leonardo's Tavern later that evening, Bertolucci and Michelangelo have taken of much
mead and they are talking]
[Bertolucci] And then, when I came home that evening, I found a dead horse in my stable!
[Michelangelo] What didst thy lady say?
[Bertolucci] Well, my lady then looked on in much dismay as I fell asleep!
[The both laugh]
[Michelangelo] Talking of such things, I muse now as to how our dear friend Antonio is progressing with
his lady his night.
[Bertolucci] Better than I, I'll warrant.
There he is. Hail Antonio! Why.are you returned so early? How
was the fair Arianne?
[Antonio] A grave error I have made, my friends. Arianne was not the lady that I had hoped.
[Bertolucci] What mean you by this, Antonio? is she not the fairest woman ever to study in these
parts?
[Antonio] Aye. that she is.
[Michelangelo] Is she not wise and merry?
[Antonio] Aye, that too.
[Michelangelo] Then what doth make thou so unhappy? If she is fair, wise and merry, what more could
thou want from her? What mistake didst thou make?
[Antonio] Aye, she is all those things that you have kindly said. But I came to realise today that she
was not anly all these things but also vain and foul company. She cannot but look at her-
self in a looking glass at all times and all she talks is of herself. A more uninteresting
person I have never met. my friends. So now, I am even more unhappy. For I completed
not the test today because I thought that I would have Arianne s company to compensate.
Alas, even that is gone now and 1 have nothing.
[Bertolucci] Worry not. Antonio. Let us drink more together and forget this mess.
[Michelangelo] Aye, there's the rub.
[Enter Scorchio
Antonio look, 'tis the evil Scorchio!
[Scorchio] Antonio, I am told that you did meet with Arianne tonight. That is an outrage for thou
knowst that she will be mine. Now I shall kill thee.
[Antonio] Thou are full of words and nothing else. Scorchio. This afternoon, did I not deafeat you
in combat. Did I not spare you life? Why do you come back still?
[Scorchio] I come to win Arianne.
[Antonio] You can have her. villain. I am not with struck any more. I think that thou will make a
fine match for her. One vain, one stupid.
