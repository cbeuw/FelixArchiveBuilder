Union faces decapitation
NEWSTEAM
Union officials reacted with shock,
dismay and bewilderment last night
as the third round of the I C U
Presidential elections came to their
conclusion, with 'New election'
again winning the race.
The turnout of voters was the low-
est for the three elections so far; a
total of 713 votes were cast which
left candidates requiring 355 to win
outright in the first round.
After the initial round of counting,
Geology student Richard Stultiens
was eliminated, the 67 votes he
polled being re-allocated among the
other candidates. Many voters who
opted for Richard put 'New election'
as their second choice, giving the
reopening of nominations a 70 vote
lead over Laurie Tweedale.
A second re-allocation saw Mech
Eng Postgrad Paul Brown's 197
votes distributed between 'New
Election' and Miss Tweedale,
although a majority of Paul's sup-
porters did not express an alternative
preference. The final totals gave
Laurie 260 votes and 'New election'
321; this being greater than the quota
of 298 voyes required to win, nomi-
nations must be held open for a
fourth time.
After the close of polling at
5.00pm, the count finished at 7.35pm
last night. This relatively short time
taken to count the votes prompted
fears of a low turnout. The candi-
dates were ushered into the Union
office to hear the result from the
elections committee, and emerged
shell-shocked some five minutes
later. Taking advantage of a PA sys-
tem on a temporary stage, I C U
President Eric Allsop announced the
result to a comparatively large crowd
of drinkers sat outside in Beit Quad.
Shortly afterwards, a bouyant
Richard Stultiens spoke to Felix:
"I'm just going to enjoy my last
week at College" he said, but added
that it was "...disappointing that no-
one could decide" over and above
the fact that he himself had not been
elected.
Defeated candidate Laurie
Tweedale made similar comments
and expressed her surprise at the
result, claiming that this time around
there had been 'serious' candidates
standing.
Other IC students, many of whom
were in the Quad to watch College
bands perform in an open-air con-
cert, reacted with surprise and, in
some cases, anger. One stated that
the students "....deserved everything
it got now" for rejecting these appar-
ently promising candidates. Other
students expressed their dismay that
the whole election process would
have to be repeated yet again.
A despondent Eric Allsop
observed "None of the candidates
ran a particularly effective campaign,
least of all 'New election'" and went
on to say "It is a bit harsh on the can-
didates; they were beaten by the pre-
vious two results rather than their
own merits - or lack of them."
ICU Deputy President for Finance
and Services elect, Rob Clark pro-
fessed to being "...amazed that 'New
election won, given the quality of the
candidates that were standing." Mr
Clark went on to suggest that "..per-
haps people were blindly voting for
'New election' just to see what
would happen."
The outcome of this election
leaves the Union in a state of poten-
tial disarray. Nomination papers
must now go up at the beginning of
continued with results, page four.
