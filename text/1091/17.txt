AWAY!!!
All you needtodo is spend 1 night
in each college hall, and you will go
onto the list of residents. Then, stand
outside any one of your "homes" and
make LOTS A N D LOTS O F
NOISE.
The college will then rebate all
students of said hall about 60 pounds
for your "inconvenience". Don't
worry that you've only lived there
for one night; THE C O L L E G E
DOESN'T!!!
(This letter is based on an adminis-
trative error made by the accommo-
dation office with respect to the
building work on the new Medical
Centre, below Falmough-Keogh hall,
and one certain individual who shall
remain nameless. £60 isn't much, but
it hints at the level of organisation
within the administration of the col-
lege).

Damn, you're on to me. I've
worked that old sixty quid ruse
every year I've been here!
smoke free, joke free
Dear Editor,
Throughout this year, I've been
increasingly appalled, disheartened
and disgusted by the lack of regard
shown by some people for their envi-
ronment and those around them.
As a first year, I rather niavely
expected that there would be some
respect amongst the students here for
the few rules that we have to live by
in order to live a more pleasant day in
a rather dreary place. Foremost
amongst these breaches is the blatant
disregard shown by most customers
of the JCR for its 'No smoking'
signs. The conditions within this sup-
posedly liberated and smoke-free
area are ghastly and most unwhole-
some.
Elsewhere, another by-law is
openly flouted by those playing foot-
ball in Prince's Gardens. It clearly
states on signs at the entrance of
these gardens that they are for 'quiet
contemplation and enjoyment' and
that 'ball games are not allowed'. So
much for revision if happens to be a
sunny day!
I don't want to sound like a bore,
but these areas have had special con-
straints on their use put on them for a
reason, not on some whim. It would
be unrealistic to expect perfection,
but might some people consider a lit-
tle before lighting up in the JCR or
punting a ball across PG?
Yours sincerely,
Richard Jenner
ALLOCATIONS PROCEDURE FOR CONTINUING STUDENTS
START OF SESSION 1 9 9 7 / 9 8
Sharine Brown, Residences Manager.
the Student A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office will be operating a new system of alloca-
tion to continuing students for the next a c a d e m i c year. In the past, many stu-
dents have relied o n chance that there would be vacancies in halls due to no
shows. Unfortunately, they have been disappointed to find that all the a c c o m -
modation has been allocated to new 1st year students, w h o are guaranteed a
place in hall. They are then in the desperate situation of being homeless a n d
feel that they have been treated unfairly.
It is likely that the next session starting in O c t o b e r 1 9 9 7 will be no different
and continuing students are strongly advised to find alternative a c c o m m o d a t i o n
well before the start of the new a c a d e m i c year. Lists of a c c o m m o d a t i o n in the
private sector will be available from the Student A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office. The
office can provide information o n short-term a c c o m m o d a t i o n , privately run
hostels a n d a c c o m m o d a t i o n agents. W e also have access to the University of
London private a c c o m m o d a t i o n list.
The reallocation of rooms that are not taken up by guarantees will be BALLOT.
Continuing students are, therefore, asked to follow the procedure set out below
and not to queue outside the A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office, 1 5 Prince's G a r d e n s .
1. Students w h o wish to be considered for any vacancies that may
occur in halls must complete a n application form, obtainable from
the basement office, 1 5 Prince's G a r d e n s , o n Saturday 4th or
Sunday 5th O c t o b e r between 1 0 . 0 0 a m a n d 2 . 0 0 p m .
2. The completed ballot forms f should be posted in the ballot box.
Students w h o d o not complete the form in full or who are found making multi-
ple applications will be disqualified.
It is extremely unlikely that w e will know before the end of the first week of term
if there are still places after allocating all new 1st year students.
A P P L I C A T I O N S F O R PLACES WILL BE D R A W N AT R A N D O M . A student will
only be contacted if their application is successful.
All vacancies occurring after O c t o b e r 20th will be advertised a n d allocated o n
a first c o m e , first served basis.

New Election wins it again! What a
performer, what verve, what p'zazz.
Except that this time round there
wasn't any. The New Election cam-
paign for sabbatical election number
four was a bit of damp squib. In fact
I didn't even notice that a movement
to re-open nominations was under
way. So, why did he win?
I would like to put forward a num-
ber of theories. Firstly, it could all be
a plot on the part of Eric to remain in

nth the last issue uglies.
This is Felix's first foray into full
colour print for a number of years. It
is also its biggest issue for a number
of years. These achievements are not
for their own sake but rather an
effort to give you, the readership, as
much good quality, entertaining
stuff as possible. This has been my
philosophy throughout the year, and
I felt that the students of Imperial
paper of Im ge
i s i n g M a n a g e r iker
College deserved a little bit more
than they had been getting.
Despite criticism of it being a "tri-
umph of style over content", I hope
that itnever can
high-sell-'em-cheap approach. Yes,
there were errors and mistakes, but
there was also a great deal of quality
writing and enjoyable material. I
think that everyone who read it
found something of interest.
As repeated elsewhere in this
issue I would like to extend my grat-
itude to all the people who have con-
tributed in whatever way to Felix
this year. I would also like to thank
the rest of you for being patient and
generally at i
1 would like to finish off by making
one last point: the students here real-
ly suck, but it's not their fault. Let
me explain. When I came to univer-
sity, I hoped to experience some
great experiences and learn some
great stuff, but above all I wanted to
meet some fantastic people. I
thought that Imperial College would
be a congregation of beautiful
minds; inquiring, open and inspir-
ing. Unfortunately it failed to hap-
pen and I'll come away knowing
only a few such people.
The main cause of this dearth of
adventurousness is a teaching sys-
tem that quickly stifles imagination
and creativity and promotes syco-
phancy and fatigue. Subsequently
we have few innovators but many
technicians. Discuss.
