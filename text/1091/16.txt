16 LETTERS F E L I X W E D N E S D A Y 18TH TUNE
Letters to Felix
election mark IV
Dear Editor,
As I write this letter, students at
Imperial are about to go through their
third round of Presidential elections.
What will be the outcome? Who
knows, but as somebody who doesn't
get to vote, I'm hoping for New
Election (again).
Why? Well, having read the mani-
festoes of the four candidates in the
last edition of Felix, I saw nothing
there to put the minds of the 1000+
new medics set to join IC in August
this year at rest. From where we
stand, the stories of tents for exami-
nation halls and hoards of Imperial
students standing at the entrance to
Beit Quad waiting to stone all new
medics to death if they dare breathe
the words 'Medics Bar' don't exactly
fill us with confidence in our new
home.
I'm not fully aware of what has
gone on in the past between St.
Mary's and Imperial, and frankly, I
don't really care. We must treat this
merger sensibly, and attempt to cre-
ate an ICSM Union that will (a) ful-
fill the needs of its members and (b)
exist in harmony with ICU and the
other CCU's - if we just try to score
political points off each other, the
bad feeling won't go away, and all
the potential benefits of the merger
will be wasted.
I'll make one thing clear; medics
are different. Our course is different,
our style of teaching and learning is
different, our terms and holidays are
different and for the majority of our
course we travel around West
London hospitals like nomads. New
medics arriving in 1998 will be
embarking on a six-year course, dur-
ing which they will be put under
enormous pressure to do well - both
for themselves and for the image of
ICSM. We want to create a Union
which will cater for these differences
and pressures and provide a 'home',
but also allow a full integration into
ICU life wherever possible.
At Imperial, you're obviously wor-
ried that the arrival of these 'pesky
medics' will threaten to divert fund-
ing away from central resources, and
penalise current clubs and societies.
Well, I'll set the record straight - we
don't want that to happen. We want
ICU and any ICSMU to fight for
increased funding, to provide a fully
comprehensive range of services,
meeting everybody's needs. Having
your cake and eating it? Absolutely.
As the saying goes, 'if you don't ask,
you don't get'. Future ICSM medics
intend to ask for (and get) all we can
from this merger, and if ICU doesn't
follow suit, well perhaps you're
electing the wrong people to repre-
sent you.
None of the four candidates mani-
festoes printed in the last edition of
Felix really promised anything dif-
ferent in future. Your next President
should be taking hold of the advan-
tages being thrown at their feet, not
simply offering hollow phrases of
unity. Next year provides the oppor-
tunity to completely review the way
ICU represents its members, to grab
itself by the throat and give itself a
damned good shake-up. I personally
believe that the best way to do this is
to elect a President with a clean slate
- not a member of any 'clique', or
with a history in the Union, but
somebody who is not afraid to come
in and bring a whole new perspective
to both the merger and future of the
Union. That is the platform on which
I stood for election here at Charing
Cross, and if it came to it, it would be
the platform on which I would stand
for election as ICU President. You
see, I believe that a Charing Cross
medic could prove to be all things to
all people - and at least an October
election would not alienate 1000
future members of the Union, as your
current elections are. So I'll make it
clear - should New Election have
won last week, I'll be throwing my
hat in the ring for the next round,
standing on a promise to create an
ICU fit for supporting the world-
leading engineers, scientists and doc-
tors of the 21st century. And should
you fill the post this time, well, you
can be sure that I'll be fighting for
what I've said above throughout the
next 12 months - because if ICU
stands still now, it may never catch
up.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Heeps, Vice-President
(elect), Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School
Students' Union.
