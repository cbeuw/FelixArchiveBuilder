HOW YOU SCORED:
0-18 Pay attention at the back! Where have
you been all year? Felix, F.E.L.I.X, is the student
S.T.U.D.E.N.T. Hello? Student newspaper of
Imperial College. Imperial College dear. Hello?
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, Imperial College,
that's right. Good grief! You are meant to pick it up
and read it, not to correct a wobbly table.
19 - 25 Ok, so you've heard of Felix and perhaps
even picked up your own copy from time to time.
You really must do better. Try reading a news story,
getting incensed and writing a letter to us complain-
ing about how bad things have come to be. You are
a typical student. Congratulations, you can run for
President.
25 - 39 With this level of knowledge, you must
read every issue avidly. Are you a member of staff
or on the Felix news team? I think we should be
told. Rest assured that the world will be safe in your
hands when you graduate into a fantastically well
paid banking job. You can run for one of the Deputy
President positions.
40 - 51 You must be the news editor - hop it. You
probably already have run for the post of Felix
Editor and succeeded. Congratulations, I shall leave
the seat warm for you.
52 Either you're cheating or you're me. If
you get this score, you can be the Felix Editor right
now. Come in and start ordering people around.
