6 NEWS REVIEW FELIX WEDNESDAY 1 8 TUNE
J E R E M Y T H O M S O N
It's June and the academic year
96-97 is petering out like a worm
drying in the sun. Let us take you
back over the peaks and ditches of
the year as we present, in our most
pithy prose, the great annual news
review...
IN OCTOBER...
As drawbridges were lowered and
portcullis raised for the new term, the
Estates Department already had
their first front page story. A large
part of the library walkway roof had
collapsed without warning. About
four tons of masonry smashed down
onto the dozens of students who were
mercifully not standing below.
On a brighter and altogether more
curvy note, returning students got
their first look at the enlarged lino-
tastic ents lounge. Renamed dB's,
with a sound system to match, the
room was a climactic improvement.
It also seems to have set a trend, with
the new JCR design owing more than
a quick fling to dB's design.
Rollerbladers were told to take a
running jump when Security extend-
ed their College-wide ban on having
fun and banned in-lines indoors.
Skaters could take solace, however,
in their stout as ICU became one of
just a few students unions to continue
selling Guinness.
It was a triple whammy for the
Boat Club, winning the Henley
Royal Regatta, the under 23s' World
Championships and planning permis-
sion to rebuild the boathouse just a
few weeks apart.
It was student politics at its best
down at the University of London
Union, when Claire Lawrie, the
Finance & Services Sabbatical, left
before she had even started. Election
season had already begun...
"Start as you mean to go on" was
apparently the motto that Guarav
Misra, C & G President, adopted for
the year. Perhaps attempting to
revive everyone after the Rector's
speech, he invited a pair of strippers
to the freshers event. Undergraduates
were bewildered as the budget-rate
male-female double-act strutted their
stuff. Ten out of ten for political cor-
rectness, but a big smelly zero for
taste.
Heavy objects continued to fall
from the skies, with Schal's crane
contractors, Hewden Stewart, drop-
ping a ton's-worth of block and tack-
le onto the Science Museum site.
They followed this first trick by
smashing a large bundle of steel
through a Chemistry Department
window, permanently crippling sev-
eral students who mercifully were
not in the room.
The cycle of destruction was com-
pleted when a copy-cat criminal
combined these cock-ups and lobbed
a full beer can from the top floor of
Tizard Hall and through a Mews
house window, rendering uncon-
scious an elderly man who merciful-
ly was not sitting just inside. (Full
beer can? Could the perpetrator real-
ly have been a student ?)
The closure of the substandard but
popular Montpelier Hall was also
announced this month, with the loss
of seventy-five beds. Simult-
aneously, homeless students took to
sleeping rough on the accommoda-
tion office steps, hoping to snap up
rooms as soon as it opened the next
day.
By late October, the dreaded
Bookstore tender had been sent out.
Bids to run the primarily student-
aimed shop were to be judged by a
panel consisting of a Dean, a Pro-
Rector and three administrative
Directors. Oh yes, and one student.
ULU's search for Vice President
Claire Lawrie's replacement was suc-
cessful first time, with Nick Dearden
taking the voters' fancy. Perhaps we
could learn something from them?
South Ealing's light-fingered lads
had been busy all autumn at
Clayponds, regularly breaking into
ground floor flats via windows that
could be opened 'with a coat hanger'.
Deadlocks were rejected on the
grounds of cost, although £160,000
was invested on new carpet.
St Mary's Hospital Medical
School Students' Union finally
secured plans for a new sabbatical
post to improve their representation.
ICU Council had agreed in principle,
but did not commit any funds, saying
that the Medics would have to find
the cash (-£8,000) themselves.
Rather to ICU's surprise, they did.
IN NOVEMBER...
Back to the bookstore. A motion to
actively boycott a non-ICU shop was
quashed by Council as too radical.
Oh, Surprise. Instead, officers hoped
to receive compensation from
College towards the loss of revenue.
This was about £70,000 and rising.
The prospect of top-up fees con-
tinued to rumble in the background
like an inadequately controlled fart.
The London School of Economics
had tried to charge for the 97-98 ses-
sion, but backed down. Similar rumi-
nations had been heard coming from
Huddersfield, Birmingham and even
UCL.
Staff too had been suffering from
dwindling funds, and the major acad-
emic unions voted (just) to stage a
one-day strike. Most courses were
disrupted, though many staff quite
reasonably stayed at home rather than
brave the dreary rain at the pickets.
Nicholas Scott; wankered.
The World-wide prestige of IC
suffered a paralysing blow when the
University Challenge team lost in
the first round. The Tory-led four-
some were defeated by Cambridge's
St. Cats on a tie-breaker.
Students everywhere could sympa-
thise with tory M P for Kensington
Blinding laser show at the sell-out freshers' carnival.
