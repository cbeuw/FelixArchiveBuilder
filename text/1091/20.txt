Plain rowing for the (very) good ship IC
On May the 3rd, the BUSA champi-
onships were at the Nottingham
water sports centre. As ever, the
water was about as tempting as a
cross channel journey to a heavily
sea-sick person. However, this was
comparable to a good day on the tide-
way. Imperial College had entered as
many boats as possible, in an attempt
to sweep the board as usual (and to
tire all the participants as much as
possible so they would be unable to
partake in heavy post-event festivi-
ties!). Particular focus was placed
upon the women's college eight as
this is the boat to be raced at Henley
and this was the venue where all like-
ly Henley opposition would race,
making this a very good sounding-
board for that event. The crew won
their final easily against Bristol (who
are at present head of the universities
league, but not for too much longer),
Newcastle, Edinburgh and
Nottingham. They also came away
with a silver for the Senior four,
which lost to Edinburgh, a gold for
the Junior four and a gold for the
pair, whose opposition looked like
they were in a different race, they
were so far behind.
The men's development squad
also entered a number of crews and
won two silvers and a bronze. This is
a somewhat incredible feat, since at
the beginning of the day they were
one man short.
On the next weekend the regatta at
Ghent took place. Ghent is on the
continent, not in Wales as some
members of the club believed. Two
minibuses set off on May the 8th
with large amounts of kit and equally
large amounts of unsuitable food to
stave off that journey boredom. Bill
Mason had left the previous day to
"sort out the accommodation". On
arrival early Friday evening, we dis-
covered that in fact the boys had
plush ensuite rooms whilst the girls
had been put up last minute in the
roof on a big line of mattresses - not
what you might expect for serious
athletes!
The Ghent racing course was
much like Nottingham, except that it
is not as deep. This means that in bad
conditions, such as that weekend, one
lane of the course might be com-
pletely sheltered and flat whereas the
others weren't. This would give an
extra 15 seconds to the lucky recipi-
ent of that lane. Again we had
entered as many boats as possible.
The women raced the college eight
on Saturday which won it's heat eas-
ily. In the final they drew Thames
Tradesmen, Tideway Scullers.
Thames A and B and some Dutch
crew. The latter had lane 1 and so
cruised to an easy first. Thames, old
rivals, had a poor start but hung on
until the last 750 metres, where per-
haps their experience paid off and
won silver, leaving IC with the
bronze. However, the Queens Tower
/ IC composite women's eight won
the gold on Sunday. The pair came
only 11 seconds behind Wilma (a
former world championship gold
medallist) and Claire's pair - an
excellent result.
The men raced their potential
Henley eight and won Under 23's.
Some of this crew were later selected
to row for Great Britain. The men's
club four also won bronze on
Saturday and Sunday.
After a long and tiring weekend,
we sampled some of the delights of
Belgian ale and sped home.
Unfortunately, some amongst our
number had somewhat oversampled
and whilst demonstrating a gymnas-
tic feat during disembarkation, man-
aged to overturn a step ladder onto an
innocent motorist's car. No IC trip is
complete without some hilaaaaaari-
ous incident of this sort.
Two weeks later at the
Metropolitan regatta, the women
won Senior 1 eights on both days,
setting a new course record. The
Queens Tower women's coxless four
won silver on Saturday and gold on
Sunday for Open Coxless fours. The
novice men won gold on Sunday
with their Senior 3 coxed four. As
they landed their boat after the race, a
disgruntled coach nearby voiced his
distress with the unfloundering suc-
cess of IC boat club at all levels -
"bollocks that's a Senior 3 four,"
quoth he - "actually that's right,"
came the reply, "we're novices':"
Last weekend Imperial took to the
water once again to race at the
London Docklands Regatta. The
women's college eight won College
eights on Saturday, beating Bristol
University and placing themselves at
the top of the Universities league. On
the Sunday, the eight won Elite
eights, beating a Queens Tower /
Thames composite crew containing
the aforementioned Wilma and
Claire in the process. The women's
novice four did well to hold their
own in a competitive Senior 3 race,
although they were just beaten into
fourth place.
The results from so far bode well
for IC in the future especially at
Women's Henley on the 21 st and
22nd June and Royal Henley on the
first week in July.

Gower power shower for the canoeing flowers
Although rain was forecast for the
weekend, enough sun was seen by
everyone on the trip to the Gower to
ensure quite uncomfortable facial
sunburn for all. The usual late depar-
ture meant that we arrived at our
favourite campsite at around 2am,
after an uneventful journey. An early
start (8.30, actually) saw us ready to
get on the beach and Surf for about
10am, all keen to attack the waves
with a mixture of enthusiasm and
ability (the two didn't always mix, as
a few early swims displayed).
The forecast of strong onshore
winds was mostly right, but the
waves seemed undiminished, and
much fun was had by everyone.
Breakfast was eaten with a minimum
of utensils, opening tins with a table
knife is a perfectionist art, although
the flavour of Safeway Economy
brands seems unaffected by eating it
in the great outdoors (as in we'll buy
better next time, really!)
A trip to the excellent local hostel-
liery complemented the day well,
with everyone performing well at the
bar, in most cases better than on the
water. After an eventful night - our
Force 10 giving up in a mere Force 6
wind, and the tent leaking in the 5
minutes of rain - another early start
with surprisingly little backlash from
the night before found the waves to
be good again, and the sun lotion was
brought into play this time, but how
long it could stay on was dubious.
Punctuated by an accident and
delays on the M4, and by a food stop
at one of our member's homes the
return journey was generally a silent,
sleepy affair, and the small minibus
was praised for it's low cost.
The club meets every Tuesday at
7.10 in Beit Quad for an hour and a
half session, and we frequently "Get
Away From It A l l " at weekends. We
introduce roughly 10 complete
beginners every year, who by the end
have attained a good level of perfor-
mance. So anyone interested in join-
ing next year, turn up on Tuesday
with swimming things on, or contact
us by email on slappers@ic.ac.uk.
