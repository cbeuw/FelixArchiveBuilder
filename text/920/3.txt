Strike action disrupted Imperial
C o l l e g e on W e d n e s d a y , 4th
December as manufacturing staff
halted work in protest about the
proposed sackings of security and
messenger staff. They also lobbied
the College's Governing Body,
which will take the decision
whether to i m p l e m e n t the
controversial plans (see Felices 917,
918 and 919)
The whole college closed down
except for the Q T snack bar in the
Junior C o m m o n R o o m (JCR), and
Southside bar. both of which are
owned by the College. Most
laboratories, libraries and computer
terminal rooms were also shut or
severely restricted by temporary
security measures.
Most students seemed unaware of
the action and continued to attempt
work, but often could not due to
library and laboratory closures. One
student told Felix that 'the strike is
a waste of time, why should they
ruin my education?'. Another
student. Daniel L l o y d L u c a s ,
sympathised with the action but saw
'no point' in not going into College.
Sue Sharpe. secretary of the
M a n u f a c t u r i n g . S c i e n c e and
Finance trade union ( M S F ) , said
afterwards that the strike went very
well and claimed that the 'College
was quieter than Christmas D a y ' .
D r Alan Taylor Russell, chairman
of the Association of University
teachers ( A U T ) , said he had no
gauge of the strike response but the
college was 'very quiet' that day.
The Rector, Sir Eric A s h , said that
he felt he was unable to comment
on how effective the strike action
had been.
The Governor's meeting released
a statement on Friday stating that
the period of negotiation would be
extended for 'one week but not
more than one m o n t h ' , and
promising to consider any proposal
that took account of Imperial

saying that all offers were part of
the consultations now taking place.
M s Sharpe claimed that the
Union's proposals were cheaper
than the present system and would
reduce the work force by natural
wastage. D r Taylor Russell said that
savings had to be made but

M r Cullen said £260.000 worth

added that £100,000 had been used
'very sucessfully' as bursarys to
attract postgraduate students to the
College. A similar scheme for
undergraduates had been less
successful, using about £10.000.

The rape alarms in the ladies
lavatories in the U n i o n Building
were found to have been turned off
on Saturday night, after a woman
was assaulted there. A female
student found a man using the
lavatory facilities and when he was
asked to leave he attacked her. In
response a rape alarm was pressed
but no alarm sounded, after which
the woman concerned managed to
remove her assailant and take him
down to the Union Bar.

which was believed to belong to the
attacker, identifying him as M r

of Cardiff University Rugby C l u b .
A test on the rape alarms
following the incident showed that
three of rape alarm plungers were
broken and would not work if they
had been turned on. T h e Duty
Maintenance officer was called to
investigate, but felt that no work
could be done to repair the system
at the time due to the possibility of
false alarms.
Deputy Head of Security Terry
Briley commented that it 'was not
directly his responsiblity' but
security should know 'what we've
got, where we've got it and whether
it works." M r Briley contiued that
a review of all alarms in college was
taking place. M r Briley could not
comment on how long it would take
to repair the U n i o n rape alarms.
Loans
There are still no firm plans to
restart student loan interviews after
Christmas. A member of staff in the
grants and fees office told Felix that
interviews had been 'fully booked
until C h r i s t m a s ' and that the
demand for interviews was 'greater
than expected." She added that 'no
interviews are being booked into the
new year". At present there are only
three interviewers to cover every
student interested in applying for a
loan. She a d v i s e d students

loan to telephone them after
Christmas.
