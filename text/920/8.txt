Lise Yates interviews Pele
How did you sign to Polydor?
W e ' r e actually signed to M & G ,
which is a small part of Polydor, it's
completely independent, Polydor
have just given them a huge wad of
cash to spend on us.
Before I formed the band I spent,
like, three or four years busking
round Europe, that's what I did, it's
the only other job I've ever had is
busking. I left school after ' A ' -
Levels, I had a lot of fun busking,
but it's hard work, and the money's
grim, you live hand to mouth, so I
wrote these songs, and found the
musicians, and that's it and we got
just like a massive live following,
and every record company under
L a ' s . I think they're something
special. But slagging other bands
off is dead unproductive.
What do you think of the
current music 'scene'?
Shite. It's grim, isn't it? G r i m l y
fiendish.
Do you have any favourite
bands at the moment?
Err, no. I like older bands, V a n
Morrison, Bruce Springstein, The
Jam, The Clash, T h e Waterboys,
Billy Bragg. I don't think there's
any real personalities left in pop
music, so we're trying to put a little
of that back into it, and that's the
main thing, a bit of vibe, a bit of
life and a few good fucking tunes.
Do you have your eyes on the
charts?
Grimlv Fiendish
the sun was phoning us up and
saying 'send us demos' and we said
'no, if you're interested in the band
you're going to have to come and
see us.' A n d they all came, and
some of them put offers on the
table, and M & G ' s was the most
right down the line, 'cause they let
us design our own sleeves, and
choose our own B-sides and
producers. They gave us a free
artistic hand, and enough money to
do what we wanted to do, which
was go out and tour and play
everywhere.
Do you think that there's a
Liverpool scene, like with the
Farm and that?
The Farm are shite. I've got no
time for The Farm at all. The only
Liverpool band I really like are The
J
Yeah, for fucking sure. W e don't
want to piss around being an indie
group. W e want to be fucking
worldwide, like, 'cause we feel as
though we've got something to
offer, lyrically as well as musically,
all of our lyrics actually stand for
something.
T h e first single was a vehement
anti-royalist song, well, more anti-
aristocracy more than royalist. It's
not based all on this little fucking
daft dance beat, it's got substance
in it, and you can still dance to it.
Do you incorporate politics like
that into all your songs?
N o , I just write completely
naturally, just whatever comes to
mind, like Raid The Palace was
written in ten minutes, I just like
spewed it out. A lot of the songs in
the set and on the album are going
to be love songs. They just come
out, it's just natural.
How long do you see the band
lasting.
Well, it's difficult, but we hope
it's 'going to have some sort of
longevity, that's why we won't
conform to any musical trends,
because trends die out. If we don't
do that, if we just stick to our guns,
sooner or later the pendulum's
going to swing round to our way of
thinking.
Freddie Mercury
One of my best friends is a massive
Queen fan, and I always really
really hated Queen, and he got
tremendous ribbing, he had the piss
taken out of him all the time, 'cause
I thought they were shite, pompous
rock, and like Freddie Mercury was
such a posing bastard, but when he
died, I realised that I didn't actually
hate him, I don't like a lot of other
music more, I just thought it was so
sad, and he was so brave, admitting
that he was dying of a disease you
shouldn't be dying of. I think it's
so grim, and tragic.
Do you think Queen will be
Christmas number one?
W h y not Queen, I mean, he did
it for twenty years, and if Freddie
Mercury hadn't been a rock ' n ' roll
star he probably wouldn't be dead
now. I hate Queen's music, but I've
mellowed in my attitudes towards
them as people. W e ' v e had people
slagging us off because they
couldn't understand why we had a
violin, and a H a m m o n d organ,
we've had people say that we're shit
because of that, but you've got to
take that on board, as a socialist,
and you've got to give everybody
a fair crack of the whip, except for
grebos and Tories.
So you don't like the Levellers
then? I thought they'd be one of
your influences.
I've never heard them. A lot of
people have said 'you sound a lot
like the Levellers', but they've
never been one of my influences.
Do you think that the
Hammond organ's a bit of a cult
thing?
T h e organ itself is a pain in the
arse, because it's so big. T h e y ' r e
a pain to transport, but nothing else
sounds like them, and ninety
percent of bands who say we've got
a H a m m o n d haven't, they've just
got samples. It's just so natural. It's
cool. W e ' l l still have it in ten years,
they'll probably have moved on to
glockenspiels or something.
Tell me about the album.
T h e album is out in M a r c h , and
no word of a lie, it's fucking great.
T h e r e ' s a track c a l l e d
Megalomania, that'll be the second
single, that's going to be the end of
January.
