T h e issues s u r r o u n d i n g t h e
continuing contretemps in the
Middle East continue to rumble on.
In the recent past the I C Anti W a r
in the G u l f Society (now the 'Just
Peace in the Middle East Society,
ICJPME) hosted a debate on the
subject between M r John Gee, a
member of the PLO-sponsored
Palestinian Solidarity Group, and
Bassem A l Jamal, a member of the
Palestinian Liberation Organisation
( P L O ) . Lee Matthews, treasurer of
I C A W I G S , entered the
conversation in a letter to Felix in
issue 918.
Their interesting use of the word
'debate' is axiomatic of the double-
attacked by Iraq and not to fight
back.
Yassir Arafat said last January:
say welcome, welcome to
war...Iraq and Palestine represent
a common will. We will be side by
side and after the great battle, God
willing, we will pray together in
Jerusalem...the Iraqi fighters and
the Palestinian stone throwers have
an appointment with victory.'
(Associated Press, 27 January
1991)
Arafat's support for Hussein
should come as no surprise to
a n y o n e . W h e n thousands o f
Chinese students were mown down
at Tiananmen Square he said to the

situation.
talk, distortion and outright lies
which the P L O use to legitimise
their message of hatred and violence
t h r o u g h their s p o n s o r e d
propogandists in the media and on
university campuses.
M r Matthews compared the P L O
with the African National Congress
( A N C ) and Yassir Arafat with
Nelson Mandela; comparisons that
are highly offensive to every
African and indeed to every human
rights sympathiser.
Israel is outside the Gulf, of
course. It is somewhat ironic that
the IC Anti-War in the Gulf Society
should host speakers from the one
organisation to support Hussein's
invasion of Kuwait and should go
to such lengths to condemn the only
country in the M i d d l e East to be
Chinese Communist Party General
Secretary:
'On behalf of the Arab
Palestinian people, their leadership,
and myself, I express the warmest,
most sincere congratulations to you,
dear comrade, on your appointment
to General Secretary of the
Comunist Party of China, and take
this opportunity to express extreme
gratification that you were able to
restore normal order after the recent
incidents in People's China. I wish
you, close friends, more progress
in your endeavour to achieve the
hopes, goals, aspirations, stability
and security of our friends, the
Chinese people.'
A n d during the recent attempted
coup d'etat in the U S S R :
'Congratulations. ..to the new and
legitimate leadership of the Soviet
Union...success in your fight
against the reactionism which has
been present until today in the
USSR and against imperialism.'
(Corriera del la Sera, August 22
1991).
O f course Yassir Arafat's support
for brutal anti-democratic regimes
around the world doesn't make him
a terrorist. Neither does it in any
way delegitimise h i m from being
acknowledged as the only and true
representative of the Palestinian
people. T h e man o f peace who
recognised Israel's right to exist in
1988 and whose organisation, the
P L O have given up their cowardly
attacks on synagogue worshippers
(Rome), kindergarten children
( M e t u l l a ) , athletes ( M u n i c h
O l y m p i c s ) , A m e r i c a n invalids
( L e o n Klinghoffer aboard the
Achille Lauro) and so on.
I wish I could believe that the
P L O has given up such actions.
Unfortunately in several interviews
s i n c e , A r a f a t has made his
standpoint only too clear:
T did not mean to renounce...
Actually, I only repeated what our
Palestine National Council had
accepted...Iam still now committed
to what I said in Cairo in 1985'
(Venice TV, December 19, 1988).
'The PLO will not stop the armed
struggle. I did not ask anybody to
refrain from military operations'
(Associated Press, Kuwait, June 6
1989).
I would wholeheartedly agree
with the I C A W I G S that it is the
right o f residents o f the West Bank
and G a z a to choose their o w n
representatives. T h e P L O (in
c o m m o n with the Governments of
all A r a b countries) were not
d e m o c r a t i c a l l y elected. U n t i l
recently no Palestinian dared to
oppose the P L O . Those delegates
who met with Israel in M a d r i d live
under death threat.
A s long as Arafat will use the
methods he used on Anwar Sadat of
Egypt (Oct 6th 1981) or earlier this
year to remove Salah Khalif, the
former number two man in the
P L O , he can claim to enjoy the
support of all Palestinians.
T h e P L O are committed to the
total destruction o f the State o f
Israel. Q u o t i n g f r o m their
c o n s t i t u t i o n , the s o - c a l l e d
Palestinian National Charter:
'Commando action constitutes a
nucleus of the Palestinian popular
liberation. Palestine, with the
boundaries it had during the British
Mandate, is an indivisible territorial
unit.
'The partition of Palestine in
1947 and the establishment of the
State of Israel are entirely illegal,
regardless of the passage of time,
because they were contrary to the
