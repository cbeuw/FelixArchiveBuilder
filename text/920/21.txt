Next week the College Governing
Body will meet to discuss the ever
present p r o b l e m o f student
accommodation. Under discussion
will be the formation of a company,
separate from the College, under
the Business Expansion Scheme
(BES) which is intended to raise a
fund of money from the staff of
Imperial College and their friends.
The money raised under the private
company will be used to purchase
existing accommodation from the
College, which will be bought back
after a minimum period of 5 years.
O n the 10th July H R H Princess
Anne visited the College to open
two new centres of technology on
the South Kensington site. The
Bagrit Centre will carry out work
on biomedical systems drawing on
the c o m b i n e d k n o w l e d g e o f
Imperial and it's partner St M a r y ' s
Hospital; the other newcomer was
T h e Centre for T o x i c Waste
Management.

this summer period due to the lack
of summer jobs adding to the toll
imposed by the poll tax and the loss
of housing benefit. Commenting on
this issue M r Ruis said that 'The so
called compensation for the loss of
housing benefit (ie Student loans)
does not really address the issue.'
O v e r the summer a group called
A c a d e m i c s F o r F r e e S p e e c h
( A F F S ) produced a four page A 5
leaflet promoting their anti-semitic
views. Covering the findings of
Fred Leuchter, an American expert
on execution, it claimed that the
mass extermination of the Jews
during World W a r II could never
have happened. Felix was informed
of the existence of the leaflet after
a local newspaper in the north east
of England called our office to find
out if we had any knowledge of the
production. O n the back of the
leaflet a credit claimed that it was
' P r i n t e d and P u b l i s h e d by

B r i l e y said that ' S p e c i a l
O p e r a t i o n s ' , one o f the
Governments security departments,
were interested in the, case as it was
tantamount to 'an incitement of
racial h a t r e d ' . Sir E r i c A s h
commented that 'There are a lot of
nutters at Imperial College, but I
cannot believe that it came from
here.' amongst other things.
T h e Mechanical Engineering
building was evacuated yesterday at
5.15pm after dangerous levels of
h y d r o g e n s u l p h i d e gas w e r e
produced in the drainage system.
T h e drains were being cleaned by
a private company who poured 93 %
sulphuric acid into them to clear a
blockage which reacted with matter
that produced the dangerous gas.
The building remained empty for 8
hours.
The ever tight accommodation
service has decided to supply bed
linen to home students no longer.
The decision was made by College
accommodation management who
instructed Housekeepers to sell
linen packs to home students.
Originally, overseas students were
also to be sold linen but after the
intervention of Jonathan Griffiths,
Deputy President, this decision was
reversed.
£12,000 of College kit was stolen
in one evening together with other
