Jacuzzis. The proposal seems likely
to be partly funded by the student
and staff users of the centre. T i m e "
put aside for clubs or societies may
also be cut o r m o v e d to
i n c o n v e n i e n t t i m e s . T h e
controversy is further heightened by
the wish of the college to open up
the centre to the general public even
more. In a written note from
G o r d o n M a r s h a l l , Director of
Estates, referring to the 'Kensington
Sports Centre', he says that the
College intends to make the centre
self financing if not profit making.
T h e manager of the Sports Centre
said that he understood that the
£300,000 renovation would be
financed by a loan from College but
did not deny that prices to students
would rise. T h e Athletics Clubs
Committee ( A C C ) said that it
believed that M r Coleman was not
remotely interested in student
facilities and had said so on more
than one occasion.
Security at Imperial College is to
be tightened up with the installation
of electronic pass card doors. T h e
system will be put in place in the
early part of next year if approval
is given by the heads of departments
who are currently reviewing the
proposal. T h e system will provide
everyone at IC with an identity card
with their details encoded upon it
and this will act as a pass key to all
or most areas of College outside of
normal hours. During the course of
a normal working day the cards will
not, as yet, be required. T h e card
will enable the system to record the
movements of students and staff
around the college and possibly
h i n d e r particular i n d i v i d u a l s '
movements by programming their
number into a computer. M r Briley,
College Security Officer said that
the precise details of the system
depended on which one College
chose. Jonathan Griffiths, Deputy
President, said that 'I can't see how
it can be detrimental to anybody.'

Forged £10 notes have been
passed to Union facilities in the past
two weeks. A n d y Flanagan, U n i o n
Bar Manager, said that such notes
are presently flooding many parts
of North and West L o n d o n . Police
said that the forgeries had no
connection with the £5M haul of
£10 and £50 notes made in Harlow,
Essex, in the last few days and no
similar reports had been received
f r o m traders in the S o u t h
Kensington area.
The I C U Dramatic Society won
a £3,000 lighting desk following
their entry into a prize draw while

Edinburgh Fringe. After their
return form the festival the society

stolen from the Concert Hall.

Police. T h e suspect was searched
but the Police found no illegal
substances, and he claimed that 'it
was a joke'.
Violence flared outside Southside

A disgruntled College employee
threw a beer barrel through the
window of a car last Wednesday
and later trashed the car owner's

Engineering, a resuscitator and
phials of amyl nitrate ('liquid gold')
from the College ambulance, four

D r Jaafar Dhiah Jaafar, a former
research assistant at IC is suspected
of being a major force behind Iraq's
nuclear weapons program as he
holds the position of V i c e President
of the Baghdad Atomic Energy
Centre. D r D a v i d Websdale of the
P h y s i c s D e p a r t m e n t doubted
however that D r Jaafar's training

T h e Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n
Careers Fair proved to be popular
with the 70 or so companies that
attended this week. The majority of
the companies, including Price
Waterhouse, Rolls Royce, and
British T e l e c o m , thought very
highly of the event which had an
estimated attendance of 5,500
students.
Holbein House residents are
complaining of the state of disrepair
of its accommodation including the
f u r n i t u r e and fittings. O n e
postgraduate student said that 'we
are expected to live like squatters'.
The College plans to close the hall
at Easter for the rest of the year. M r
Graham Daniels, Residences A r e a
Manager, said that he is considering
Holbein a priority case and will be
initiating a project to 'rectify major
faults in showers' but admitted that
faults cannot be fixed over-night, a
point proved in Holbein for at least
the last seven years.
Imperial College's Caroline Fox,
Director of Personnel, unveiled a
document on the College's Equal
Opportunities Programme which
lays down policy on the advertising
of job vacancies and interviewing
procedure. Rob Letham told Felix
that 'we want to show we care about
the people we employ' and said that
although he didn't know how the
programme would be implemented
he expected feedback by November
- see issue 917.

A first year chemistry student,
Stephen Dorman, was seriously
injured during an attempt to kidnap
the Royal College of Science Union
( R C S U ) mascot last Thursday. The
accident which involved a vehicle
being driven by a City and Guilds
U n i o n member ran over M r
D o r m a n ' s l e g and caused a
compound fracture. A n ambulance
was c a l l e d and the P o l i c e
interviewed the witnesses to the
event. After being taken to hospital
the leg was operated on twice. T h e
incident has called into question the
current state of mascotry at IC and
preceded a meeting on the subject.
It is expected that from now on
mascotry between the C C U s of the
College will take part upon campus
only. The Police have reported the
driver for reckless driving and
driving without due care. M r
Dorman asked the Police not to
press charges and said that people
in his view took mascotry far too
seriously.
Student loan applications have
risen since last year and has caused
a long waiting list for interviews
currently lasting up to November
25th. Last year students across the
country borrowed an average of
£338 under the loan scheme, but to
date 30,000 people have applied for
£570 or more. The Government has
viewed the increased up take of the
scheme as an acceptance of the idea
but T o n y C u l l e n , A s s i s t a n t
Registrar said that this year 'student
loans are a fact of life', whereas
Southside halls - fun and games, violence and arson.
