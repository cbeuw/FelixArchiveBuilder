According to Union policy, discreet
and unavoidable sex is allowed in
the U n i o n Building. But what is the
definition of being discreet and
unavoidable? Here at Dear Marge
the subject has often been debated
and we have decided that the only
times sex can be unavoidable is if
a) the persons involved are at a dirty
disco. The female thinkingthat the
guy is rather tasty and the guy being
a little excited himself fall together
on the dance floor and it accidently
slips in. O r b) if it involves the
U n i o n President herself. ' A n y
chance and she'll take it!' said Steve

Thought for the Day...
W h y is it that when your pubic hairs
grow the first time round they don't
itch, you don't notice them growing
and they just appear over night.
W h e n you shave them off for any
reason (crabs, operations o r
aesthetic reasons(?)) they itch like
fuck, take ages to grow back and
you're consciously aware of their
presence! (Or lack of)
A n d the final word is...
It's crimbo time again and so down
to the true meaning of Christmas...
get pissed, get stoned, get laid but
for fucks sake be happy!
O o h - e r Missus
I was wrong about you all last
week... you're not really that
apathetic as something has actually
happened around the college. Yes,
someone seems to have made some
progress on the T a m s i n front.
Martin Heighway was alleged to
have spent the night in the young
ladys hall, maybe even in her
bedroom. Does this mean that the
betting is over? T h e M o l e , who
kindly informed me of this event
says that the 'two of them were seen
leaving Garden hall on the morning
o f 2 9 . 1 1 . 9 1 t o g e t h e r . . . but
unfortunately both were clothed at
the time.' Another reliable source
has informed me that Martin has
been known to spend nights in the
Jez garage, does that mean that she
is on his list o f people to pork too?
So let's have a review of the stakes:
Martin Heighway 3:1
Stuart Risen 5:1
Howie 2:1 (fav)
Ian (her man) 200:1 - no chance o f
him keeping her if she has all these
men chasing her at the moment.
W i l l 8:3
Simon 4:1

A n d on to Rag... or rather the rag
mag. The following quotes have
been heard around college:
'Its all true' - A . R a n d o m
'Gee how swell' - A . T o k e n
American
'Its absolutely foul and disgusting-
I love it!' - A . N . O t h e r Random
' W h o wrote this - I'll buy him a
pint!' - M e
'It is an insult to all human life, it
shouldn't affect anyone at Imperial'

W e all would like to thank Martin
H e i g h w a y for an excellently
disgustingly brillo rag mag - so get
out there peeps and see how many
places will ban it this year. Lets just
say that Manchester banned it
before it was even published!
