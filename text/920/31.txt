A VIRGIN MARY?

melons
would mellow any fella.
+ MOUTHWATERING Mary,
~ 38,24,36, lists her pas-
sions as cooking, wearing
veils and windsurfing on
Lake Galilee.
.JL. MERRY Mary Christmas
says when she grows up
she wants to meet her
perfect man and bear him
many children.
J L . WELL I certainly
wouldn't mind her bear-
ing something for me!
Capricorn (23rd Dec - 20th Jan)
You become convinced that Wood Engineer-
ing at Imperial College is not worth writing
a book about and will accidentally found a new
religion. Your favourite food are mince pies
and your lucky colour is white.
Aquarius (21st Jan - 19th Feb)
You will witness a visitation by a man of-
fering round mince pies and singing Max
Bygraves' greatest hits. Fortunately a double-
glazing salesman will call at a convenient time.
Pisces (20th Feb - 20th March)
This is not a good week for plans of world
domination. Your personal army will revolt
and a UN peace keeping force will set up camp
in your kitchen. Your Christmas Cactus
flowers.
Aries (21st M a r c h - 20th April)
Understanding household appliances will
seem easy this week, so set your video for the
whole year. Quite how you'll feel in three days,
when your fridge defrosts in a suicide bid, is
another cookie crumbling.
Taurus (21st April - 21st May)
Mars, in the house of Pluto, twinned with
an expectant moon could mean an unexpected
call from a tall dark stranger offering a recor-
ding contract for your new song. Or it could
be a flock of flightless waterfowl complaining.
Gemini (22nd May - 21st June)
A surprise visit from the Pope may be
delayed if you don't replace that carton of
milk. You will discover friends in strange
places who nurse you in your hour of need,
but ultimately Jupiter dictates that you have
to come to terms with not meeting a religious
notary this week.
Cancer (22nd June - 23rd July)
Although you feel like putting your feet up,
this is the perfect time to practice your spor-
ting activities. Y o u may be disappointed not
to be picked for the forthcoming international
tournament but darts is a cut-throat game.
Leo (24th July - 23rd Aug)
Y o u have vivid dreams of black macs and
squirty cream but by a stroke of luck you are
not certified. Venus in the ascendant is cer-
tain to bring good fortune this week in your
quest to sweet talk a horoscope writer. O r
cartoonist.
Virgo (23rd A u g - 22nd Sept)
Becoming a photophobe and staying in bed
seems a good idea this week and could result
in relationships entering a closer phase. Freak
local hurricanes could spoil your enjoyment
if left to fester - take the advice of a diminutive
friend.
Libra (23rd Sept - 22nd Oct)
It's your turn to receive a surprise gift this
week from a superior. This should give your
business life the spark it needs, but be warn-
ed that it's difficult to know what to do with
a gift certificate for a frontal lobotomy.
Scorpio (23rd Oct - 21st Nov)
A suspicious package delivered to your
home will be mistaken for an X rated video,
causing your rabbit to become paranoid. This
cloud has a silver lining since your home
movie business starts to take off.
Sagittarius (23rd Nov - 22nd Dec)
Slowly your week turns from being
understandably random to frantically vague
as relationships get more confusing than ever.
A seemingly solid barrier will become just a
technical hitch w i t h t h e invention of
cheesecake.
