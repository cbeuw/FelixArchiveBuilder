F o r those of you who have yet to
set foot out of Knightsbridge/
Kensington, probably one of the
trendiest places to visit and hangout
is Camden T o w n . Both during the
day and night, there's much to do
and see and a place which is
buzzing with sound and energy is
the Jazz Cafe on Parkway, which
is open every night and offers
weekend lunches, with the beat of
funky music and live acts whilst you
enjoy the buffet lunch. T h e owner
John Davner has done a brilliant job
on the resurrection of the venue and
most rate it along with Ronnie
Scotts, but in my opinion it's a
'where it's at' or 'the happening
place' and to support this, I spent
Saturday lunchtime there eating and
loitering to the music of The Hip
Joints (who incidentally have played
at IC), in their two afternoon
sessions.
T h e band have been together
around nine months and are very
funky in sound where each member
is inclined to his own rhythmic
movements and noise, which all
join to form a unique beat and bass
funk. They started well and Dave
Prizeman on trumpet blew his heart
out to a unding welcome and
worthy of any jazz hall of fame (if
there is one). T h e totally relaxing
bass, Keith Pitts, held the music
together in parts and gave the Hip
Joints the underlying music beat.
However the lead vocalist's rapping
and singing occasionally to a minor
extent detracted from the band's
impact as musicians. Although in all
fairness, he more than made up by
playing some sweet solo sax

Sometimes the music took to the
inclination of that South A m e r i c a n
Brazilian style which was more than lunch, around very art deco

W e l l , the cover of this compilation
promises 'Banging tunes for Hard
beat fans'. What can I say? If that's
the kind of music you like then I
suppose you might buy it.
This double album gives you 16
tracks: at first attempt the holes in
