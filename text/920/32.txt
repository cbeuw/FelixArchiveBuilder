Scandal Secrets
The Captain of the Guards raided a seemingly in-
nocent stable in the quiet suburbs of Bethlehem
last night, writes our Middle East Correspondent,
Yasser Al-Bazouka. The soldiers arrested three
visiting academic men from the Far East here on
sabbaticals, on charges of bestiality and CHILD
MOLESTING.
The Men were discovered after acting on information from
local shepherds, regarding the losses of flocks. "We were all
looking up at a strange image in the sky," said A m o s Somerset,
one of the shepherds "and when we looked down significant
numbers of lambs were missing".
Following the trail of ripped fleece, guards traced the three men to an insignifi-
cant stable in the grounds of a Bethlehem Hotel. To the guards' horror they had
stumbled across a S A T A N I C RIGHTS ceremony involving, animal sacrifices, small
children and little furry animals.
Residents of the hotel had complained earlier in the evening about the bleating,
wailing and screeching coming from the stable. The three men, aged 19, 34 and
56, later described the events as "common practice, down our way. We didn't know
ritual sacrifice was banned in this country. That's the problem with these oppressive
societies."
