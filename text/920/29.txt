VIRGIN ON THE
RIDICULOUS!

DOCTORS are baffled by a claim
of SEX with GOD. MARY DAVID-
SON, 14, has just given birth to
a bouncing baby boy, without
ever having had any HANKY
PANKY. She says that she is still
a VIRGIN, even though this is
plainly IMPOSSIBLE.

'HE was a perfect gentleman' said Mary,
'and NOTHING happened between us'. 'I
just found myself PREGNANT', she added.

Her husband, J o s e p h ,
then her fiance said he
wanted to 'Keep it in the
family' and refused to
comment further.
In a press conference
after the birth she com-
plained about the 'poor
standard' of accommoda-
tion in the area. She had
to share a room with an
Ox, an Ass, and three
Kings who were in town to
pay homage to Herod's
newborn son.
The birth took place in
the early hours of the
m o r n i n g but w i t h i n
minutes they had decided
on a name; Jesus. 'We felt
like giving him a modern
name, a name people will
remember.'
