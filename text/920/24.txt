Arab Eats Babies Student Loan Moan
Dear Adam,
I am worried by the increased
number of pro-Israeli students in
college who are feeling threatened.
First there were G a b y Pell's
repeated expressions of concern
over the invitation of a P L O speaker
to a college event. Furthermore, an
i n c i d e n t on T h u r s d a y 28th
November made me realise the
scale of the problem.
While manning the Friends of
Palestine stall in the J C R , as part
of the international week organised
by O S C , I was thinking about some
research I am currently doing.
'This is in Israel' I heard someone
say. I raised my head and saw a
young student (seemed like a
fresher) h o l d i n g up a h a n d
embroidered bookmark and waving
it in my face. B y the time I had
managed to blurt out 'sorry?', he
was asking;
' A r e you claiming this?' F o r a
fraction of a second I thought he
was t a l k i n g about the
bookmark...' 'cause if you are, then
I m very distressed!'.
Then it all fell into place. T h e
bookmark, which was no longer
being waved around, had Jaffa
embroidered on it, with two
Palestinian flags either side of it. H e
was concerned that our society took
the stance that Israel should be
destroyed, and that even the parts
of Israel recognised by the U N , like
Jaffa, should be taken over by
Palestine.
B y that time one friend had
offered to call him an ambulance,
while another suggested that he
saved his breath until the peace talks
resumed in Washington. H e left,
presumably as distressed as he was
at the start.
What he had failed to notice was
that the whole exhibition avoided
political stances, especially in the
current state of flux in the M i d d l e
East, and concentrated on culture
(crafts, music, food etc) and the
human rights issues, such as health,
e d u c a t i o n and i m p r i s o n m e n t
without trial. (The offending piece
of material, which was promptly
removed, was part of the Medical
A i d for Palestinians catalogue, a
charity for which Pauline Cutting
was working when she was in the
Palestinian refugee camps in
Lebanon.)
That being our objective, which
I think the exhibition achieved, we
did not want discussions with
distressed students on the day, but
I think the issue must be raised, in
the interest of student welfare in the
college.
A couple of points to M r Pell,
before I reveal the frightening truth.
1. Y o u say that the P L O has
never been voted for by the
Palestinians, could it perhaps be
because the O c c u p y i n g Israeli
government, in all of its love for
d e m o c r a c y , has not a l l o w e d
elections?
2. Y o u say '...that in the large
majority of cases, the killing of
Palestinians has been carried out by
their own kind, for collaboration,
rather than by Israelis.' In a
situation of military occupation,
such as was the case with German
forces in France throughout W o r l d
W a r II, what do you suggest is the
percentage of deaths of civilians due
to suspicion of collaboration, 5 0 % ?
7 0 % ? 9 0 % ? E v e n the, stupid as
your unconfirmed statistic may be,
had there been no occupation by
Israel, do you not even entertain the
thought that the life expectancy of
a Palestinian may have been slightly
higher?
3. Under military occupation law
in the West Bank and Gaza, a 12
year old boy may be jailed for no
reason, and most have been. T h e
current Israeli prime minister is a
self-confessed terrorist. Given those
facts, I suspect that b e i n g
imprisoned in Israel has little to do
with the murder o f innocent
Civilans.
4. A s r e g a r d s the re-
establishment vs the creation of a
state, don't be such a pedantic git.
Y o u can argue till you are blue in
the mouth that there never was a
Palestinian state. The fact that there
have been Palestinians, as a
majority of the population for
longer than there has been a state
of Israel in the region. This does not
make Israel non-existence, it is here
now as a state, with U N recognised
borders.
Wake up, and forget the dogma
that you have been spoonfed. Israel
was not established solely on some
legitimate c l a i m , and d i v i n e
p r o m i s e s ; p e o p l e had to be
murdered or forcibly removed from
their h o m e s , p o l i t i c i a n s
m a n i p u l a t e d , and U N peace
negotiators blown up. Let us face
the reality of the situation, and save
the whole region further bloodshed.
Enough of those stupid historical
arguments.
A s for the frightening truth about
our claims, and the distress they
cause, you can make the obvious
conclusions from that piece of
embroidery. It can only mean one
thing.
W e are an evil bunch of mad
Dear Adam,
I would like to raise a point about
a very widely discussed issue—that
of Student Loans—that doesn't
seem to get too much publicity.
It would seem that, short of a
revolution or possibly a general
election, student loans are here to
stay. They are going to become a
fact of life if they are not so already.
However, the major problem
facing most students is not having
to pay back a loan, but having
enough money to survive on. It is
certainly the biggest pain in my
neck at the moment. So why not
make more money available in the
form of loans, such that students,
in the short term, have a feasible
amount of money instead of the
purely hypothetical amount they
have at the moment, yet the
government can satisfy all those;
doctors and stockbrokers out there
Dear Sir,
W e feel it has become necessary
for us to publicly explain our
position over the recent resignation
of the Rag Chairman, M a r c Ellis.
Despite the overall success of
Rag this year there have been many
organisational problems. Prior to
Rag Week, the Chairman was
talked but o f resigning and stated
that he would communicate more
with the committee and would
delegate tasks to them.
During the course of the next few
weeks it became clear that none of
these problems had been resolved.
W e again met with the Chair to
discuss with him what the problems
were. The meeting ended by the
Arabs, who would do anything to
destroy the peace loving and
insecure state of Israel. W e have
never in our hearts accepted the
presence of Israel, and will fight on
until the last child to destroy it. W e
are so vicious in fact, that Israel
needs to posess nuclear weapons as
an ultimate protection against our
terrorist attacks on civilians. W e
produce such ingenous evil leaders,
ones who will destroy Israel by
blowing up places, and invading
other Arab countries. Plots so
obviously well hatched to destroy
Israel, it is surprising none of them
have worked so far.
A l l Arab students in this college
are on a secret mission to acquire
the know-how to destroy Israel.
by maintaining that the money will
be repaid?
O f course, this means greater
short term expenditure (so I've
probably just answered my own
question) but no increase in long
term spending other than the
inflationary one already present. A n
extra £500 or so would probably do
(fat c h a n c e , I k n o w ) and
considering that everyone who
graduates earns fat wodges of cash
within days (honest, they do) an
extra £2000 over a four year course
becomes fairly trivial against an
expected debt of £6-7000 which will
be with undergraduates in the
future.
I dare say I'm not the first to try
to publicise such an idea, but
amongst all the unleashed rage it
seems to have been overlooked.
Yours idealisticaily,
Paul Davison, Physics 2.
C h a i r s a y i n g that he w o u l d
officially resign the following day.
It was clear to us that evening that
he would not change his mind nor
would it be a good idea either for
Rag, or for him, to continue in his
position. It was for this reason that
we did not sign the letter from the
committee asking him to reconsider
his position. W e feel that if M a r c
Ellis were to be reinstated the
situation would again degenerate, to
the detriment of Rag.
Rag meetings are continuing as
normal, and Rag will continue its
activities throughout the year.
Yours faithfully,
Will Stallard, Acting Rag Chair,
Sarah Goodchild, Rag Treasurer.
Back home our families breed more
terrorists to send them against the
hopelessly outnumbered Israeli
army, so that we can recover Jaffa,
and swim in a sea of blood, since
we obviously enjoy that sort of'
thing, being Arabs (I personally eat
two babies every day).
Between you and me, Israel is
being far to gracious in actually
making an effort to talk to us, and
only using tear-gas, plastic bullets,
live ammunition, and a policy of
beating and terror to stem the flow
of our violence. The ultimate
solution is for them to round us up,
and...
Yours sincerely,
Amin El-Kholy, Doc PG.
