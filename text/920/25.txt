Judo Injustice
Dear Adam,
I a m driven to bring a grave
injustice to your attention. Due to
yet more examples of incompetence
by IC Union, in particular the A C C
(Athletics Clubs Committee), the
Judo Club has been denied half of
its weekly training sessions.
The Judo C l u b has been training
in the U n i o n gym on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings for at least ten
years. Despite reconfirming these
times at the start o f term as usual,
the U n i o n has seen fit to deny the
club use o f the gym on Thursday
evenings in favour o f the Football
C l u b w h o already train in the
volleyball court at that time.
Unfortunately, unlike football,
judo can only be practised indoors,
using mats which are stored in the
g y m . Efforts that I have made to
point this out to the U n i o n have
been ignored, no one wanting to
accept responsibility for the cock-
up. I ' m really starting to wonder
whether this is simply stupidity on
the part o f the U n i o n or just plain
apathy. A s it stands, I cannot see
the Judo C l u b surviving much
longer if it is reduced to training
once a week, a pity as it is the
second oldest Judo Club in the
country. Members of the C l u b not
only represent the College but also
fight for L o n d o n University and
compete in national events. They
deserve better treatment than they
are receiving from the U n i o n .
Unless the Union wakes up to the
situation a n d a c t u a l l y does
something for once, I will have to
c o n s i d e r t r a i n i n g w i t h , a n d
representing another college, such
as U C L . I cannot bring myself to
represent a Union that does not give
a shit about its students.
Yours sincerely.

Posters Torn Down
Dear Editor.
H e a r i n g o f all the acts o f
vandalism around the college
recently. I would like to highlight
another aspect o f this cowardly
crime.
The I C Islamic Society held an
Islamic Week between 18th and
22nd November. This consisted of
a series of talks on different aspects
of Islam, which were open to all
members o f this college. T o
publicise for this event we had
posters all over college. However
it is sad to note that most o f these
posters were torn down soon after
being put up! This cannot be
accredited to the wind or other
natural forces, as even our cabinet
in the Sherfield Walkway was
deliberately opened and posters
inside it ripped down.
So, can I ask whoever the
person(s) involved to stop this
vandalism, and if he would like to
express himself openly I am very
willing to talk to him personally.
Vours disappointedly.

Run Out
Dear Adam.
It saddens me to admit it, but
incompetence seems to have raised
its ugly head at the Careers Service.
It would seem that the whole
concept of this service would be to
aid students in their attempt to get
jobs. This they have done, with a
helpful series o f presentations and
seminars. However, one would
have thought that central to the
pursuit o f a j o b would be the
completion of an application form.
Then why is it that the careers
service has run out o f standard
application forms in the appropriate
boxes (some o f w h i c h a r e
apparently redundant—'Some o f
those boxes have been there since
the beginning o f time.', was the
explanation I received)?
When I suggested that the careers
service at this centre o f academic
excellence could maintain a reserve
of say 500 S A F s , I was met with
a dismissive laugh and ' Y e a h I
suppose so.'
A m I living on the right planet?
Yours etc..
