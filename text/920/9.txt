T h e 35th L o n d o n F i l m Festival
c a m e to t o w n d u r i n g m i d -
November, loaded with over 200
films from all around the world.
W e l l , so many films so little time,
and not enough dosh. There are big
names, including Point Break and
Frankie and Johnny, but the jewels
of the Festival are probably obscure
productions.
Let's kick off with what must surely
have been one of the best films at
the festival—Urga, directed by
Nikita Mikhalov. Urga is a French-
Russian co-production, filmed in
Mongolia. Mikhalov weaves a
goofy tale in which little of
consequence ever comes to pass.
A n d yet it captures the imagination
like few other films I have seen. It
really is a strikingly beautiful
A treat for Hindi film fans must
have been the appearance of demi-
g o d A m i t a b h B a c h c h a n ,
interviewed by the rather bland
Derek Malcolm from the Guardian,
Bachchan did his best to enliven the
audience. A h , but Amitabh, we
must surely be eternally thankful for
your very presence!
A lot of film critics (yes, we had
spies in the Press Tent) voted Raise
the Red Lantern as their favourite,
and so did I (Su). This new film
from Chinese director Z h a n g
Y i m o u r e s e m b l e s his last,
acclaimed, film (Ju Dou) in the way
that both of them depict how
women were suppressed under the
patriarchal Chinese society during
the early 19th Century. The story
is set in the reputable Chen clan this
if it were not for 'Life on a string'.
Compared with Raise the Red
Lantern, Life on a String is not as
c o m m e r c i a l , but viewers will
certainly be captured by the
stunning photography offered by
director Chen Kaige. It's about the
m a g i c o f b e l i e v i n g and the
emotional struggles of being highly
respected. The film, however, over
uses symbolism, but this is really
n o t h i n g c o m p a r e d w i t h the
magnificent scenarios. For someone
who wants a feast for their eyes.
If Martial Arts is your favourite
thing, then Once Upon a Time in
China should not be missed. It's a
typical action-packed film from
H o n g K o n g , with surprisingly,
political and satirical undertones
and is about the legendary
with his family intending to
introduce him to his son. Except for
some open gay sex scenes, this is
more suitable for the small screen.
The Grass Arena is a real gem and
certainly looks like a real film.
Adapted from the fascinating
autobiography of John Healy, it
starts with his youth as a boxer
because of influence from his
violent father, then switches
between his descent into alcoholism
and his rehabilitation, and finally
details his career as a successful
chess player. W i t h an unusual life-
s t o r y , some o u t s t a n d i n g
performances and a neat direction,
this film stands out miles ahead of
the others. Highly recommended.
French film lovers should be
satisfied with the varieties of French
London Film Festiva
film—Mikhalov making full use of
the undulating Mongolian landscape
and adding his own flighty images
and dreamscapes.
In a lesser league, but very much
knowingly so, stands Nicholas D e
Jacob's The Refigerator. A spoof
h o r r o r m o v i e c o m p l e t e with
morality twists, it concerns the all
consuming desires of a refigerator
(i.e. the American or capitalist way
of life). Eileen and Steve Bateman
move into their apartment in a
seedier part of New Y o r k , hoping
to 'make it' without falling into all
the associated traps of 'success'.
But very quickly Steve and Eileen
are changed by the city, and their
relationships are distorted by the
a f o r e m e n t i o n e d a p p l i a n c e . . .
(coming to an I C A near you).
T w o films from which one might
have expected more were John
Sayle's City of Hope and Errol
(Thin Blue Line) Morris's The
Dark Wind. Sayle's film (which
may be compared unfavourably
with Do the Right Thing) tackles the
issue o f race relations in a
crumbling American city. The film
tends to ramble since Sayle insists
on representing every member of
the community and thus diluting the
whole effect. Morris's film just fails
as a good thriller.
A guy on top form, though, was
Paul Cox, with his follow-up to The
Golden Braid—A Woman's Tale.
The film deals unsentimentally but
with complete passion with the
advent of old age.
M i r a Nair's superb debut (Salam
Bombay) was followed up by her
H o l l y w o o d debut—Mississippi
Masala with tons of groovy music,
excellent script, big names (well,
Denzel Washington) the film should
do very well at the box office.
time, where Songlian (played by the
striking G o n g L i again) is sent as
Fourth Mistress to the master, and
the film continues with the rivalries
between the mistresses and the
master's favourite until a shocking
climax when one o f the mistresses
is found committing adultery.
Instead of the wonderful contrast of
colours like in Ju Dou, director
Zhang Y m o u this time uses space
and decor to create the tense
atmosphere in the B I G house. Sex
has never been depicted in such a
subtle but revealing way before, for
example, when the camera focused
on the facial expression of Songlian
who,is imagining herself being foot-
' massaged by one of the maids. A
sophisticated thriller with an
excellent cast.
In fact, it may be the film from
China to be nominated for the best
foreign film in the Oscars next year
Cantonese hero who has been
portrayed in more than 90 Hong
K o n g films since the late 40s.
Brilliant entertainent and it's
already a box office smash in Hong
K o n g .
This year's Spanish box office hit
(according to the producer himself),
is also in the Festival. Lovers (aka
Amantes) revolves around a young
officer's relationship with his
fiancee Trini (Maribel Verdu), who
is still a virgin and his landlady
Luisa (Victoria Abril), who offers
him wild sex and love. Eventually
he surrenders to Luisa and kills
Trini to help Luisa to kill his
fiancee. But then this is a real life
story. Victoria A b r i l was awarded
best actress in Berlin for this film,
though in my opinion, Maribel
V e r d u offers a more remarkable
performance. The Dutch film An
Indecent Woman is another erotic
drama who tells the affair of a
married woman with a stranger.
The special point of the film is that
the story is told from the woman's
point of view, and therefore there
aren't any moral judgements which
are always expected in other films.
There are also some made-for-
T V broadcast films including The
Lost Language of the Cranes and
The Grass Arena. The former is
about a family with a gay father
(Brian Cox), who is a university
lecturer and has been in the closet
for many years, his secretive wife
(Eileen Atkins) and their son Owen
( A n g u s M a c F a y d e n ) . S t r o n g
p e r f o r m a n c e s a r e - o f f e r e d ,
particularly Brian C o x , when he is
confronted with the truth that his
son is also gay. T h e story however
becomes a bit hilarious when the
father deliberately invites his
young, straight colleague to dinner
films offered, including A u x Veux
Du Monde and Merci La Vie, both
of which feature the up and coming
actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. A
special mention about the film Aux
Veux Du Monde (directed by Eric
Rochant) is that its main character
is one of the best anti-heroes
portrayed in film history so far. H e
kidnaps a school bus and thinks this
will impress his girlfriend! The kids
in the film offer a l i v e n i n g
atmosphere to the film.
Something that has to be said
about the Festival is that there are
many substandard films like The
Soultaker and Liquid Dreams. T h e
o n l y g o o d t h i n g about The
Soultaker is its quotes: ' L e d
Zeppelin was wrong. There is no
stairway to heaven'. It's even a
compliment to say it's a piss-take
of Ghost. Liquid Dreams has some
stylish decor, but is let down by a
poor script.
Enough bad words said about the
quality of the films chosen. Here
are some other films which have not
been covered, but have very good
hypes during the festival:
Betty's Brood (Scotland)
A Brighter Summer Day
(Taiwan)
Delicatessen (France)
Hearts of Darkness—A Film
Makers Apocalypse (USA)
Proof (Australia)
Toto the Hero (Belgium)
I nearly forgot to mention the
brilliant trailer of the F i l m Festival
directed by M i k e Leigh. Hopefully
the L o n d o n F i l m Festival will be
even better next year.
