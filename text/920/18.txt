Water Polo on Canoes!
W i t h visions of gold medals, fast
c a r s , easy m e n / w o m e n and
sponsorship from a well known
prophylactic manufacturer we set
off to Warwick. But the road to the
top is not an easy one especially
when W a r w i c k University is in
Coventry! W e finally arrived and
then the big moment... the debut of
Imperial's crack canoe polo squad
against Nottingham.
Due to a slight unfamiliarity with
the rules we eased ourselves into the
first half of the match by striking
fear into the hearts of our opponents
- and quickly conceded five goals.
H a v i n g got the hang of the sort of
skill, cunning and outright violence
necessary to succeed we stuffed
them in the second half, only
conceding one other goal!
By now our reputation as ruthless
goal mongerers had spread. The
intimidation ploy obviously worked
in our next game as Bangor put
away the first goal. This fired the
killer instinct in our team and
caused a most unprecedented pass
to occur which produced our first
ever goal!
Both teams needed the full half
time break for shock counselling

Back to last years form, the
Dribblers were severely let down by
several players. A s a result the
Dribblers only had eight players,
one of w h o m had been run over
earlier that week (Ethel) and
another who should have stayed in
her sickbed (Sharon).
D e s p i t e these m i n o r
inconveniences (including the
absence of Captain Permi - who
surprisingly chose to play in an F A
C u p match instead) the Dribblers
lived up to their recent reputation
of being amazing - until Sussex
scored. Suddenly the Dribblers
found themselves 2-0 down at half
time.
After a rousing team tactic talk by
acting Captain Sara and a change in
defence due to illness, the Dribblers
held their stance for another 5 mins,
before conceding another five goals
during the second half.
H a d the Dribblers had any
forwards the result would have been
v e r y different as the
midfield/defence had some stormin'
near misses. Everyone played well
especially Chandra in defence.
Thanks to those who did turn up to
play, it was a cracking attempt and
at least we didn't cancel the game
at the last minute.

Broomball
Broomball is a game played on ice
in flat shoes with a large orange ball
and sticks with triangular plastic bits
stuck to the ends. This seems really
silly, well it is, but it's great fun.
T h e first IC ( U L U ) Broomball
Club event took place last Friday
(29th Nov) at Broadgate icerink.
After muzzling the goalies and
fighting for the trendiest padding,
the teams of four were ready for
action.
The yellow team won - this might
have been due to the fact that they
had the most experienced players or
that they were good. T h e red team
were excellent on attack and Jenny
of the blue team was a real demon.
Keith and C h r i s decided that
acrobatics on ice was much more
fun while Suma spent a lot of time
on her bottom. G o a l scorers were
Keith, Jemmy, Dave, Brian, Terry
and Dave.

After a long absence from the U L
Championships, Imperial managed
not only to field a team but to win
the overall team trophy for the first
time since the early eighties.
The first round of the competition
took place on M o n d a y 18th
November. It soon became apparent
that IC and U C were the only teams
in condition and the end of the
round saw IC coveting a four point
advantage over their rivals.
T h e second round on Thursday
21st November saw U C desperate
to keep hold of their trophy. A
passionately fought duel ensured
