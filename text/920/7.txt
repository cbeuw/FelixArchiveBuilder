Munich Philharmonic plays Abba Classics
Munich, or possibly Berlin.
Blur - High Cool
Blur's Christmas chart hopeful, and
it sounds just the same as all the
others. If you liked them, you'll like
this. If not, you won't. In fact I ' m
beginning to suspect that Blur are
actually just releasing the same disc
over and over, and just changing the
label.
Lise Yates.
The Munich Philharmonic was
respected throughout the world.
That was before they went totally
loopy. I have convincing evidence
right here. Fortunately for them,
I'm mad as well. I love it. Thirteen
absolute peaches o f s o n g s ,
marvellously orchestrated. I think
it's possibly the best C D we've ever
had. It's karaoke for the upper
class. Abba are the only decent
thing ever to come out o f Northern
Europe, and this is the second most
lovely thing ever to come out o f
M u n i c h , and I think I know what
I'm talking about even if you don't.
G o on, defeat Freddie's sick ploy
to get someone to buy Queen
records and buy this instead. If you
don't like it, give it to your M u m
for Christmas. O r my M u m .

Pele/GNE - IC Union
I don't know about GNE, I really
don't. O n record they come out
really quite ethereal and lovely, but
live, they're kind o f uninvolving
really. Bearable, well worth three
quid for them alone, y o u boring
bastards, but nothing special.
Pele on the other hand, are quite
rocky and folky, in a poppy sort of
way. I'd rather have half an hour
of them than 2 hours o f Bad
Manners any day. Shame that most
of y o u lechers were there for
N i c k o ' s legs, and not for the tunes.
Still, never one to shun it's readers,
Felix has a treat for you on page 14,
'cause at least you were there. A
lovely, early Christmas p r e s E N T ,
and I ' m talking about Pele, y o u
pervs.
Lise Yates.
Dan (vocals, guitar) and Matt
(Bass) and Ian (guitar) are
backstage at Thames Poly.
What do you want us to talk about?
I dunno, just chat away.
Tell them about the new album
Yeah, tell me about the new
album.
Well, when we've released the first
single, then we'll do the album.
H o w about that time when T o b y
got off with that bloke?, suggests
Dan, and he took his clothes off and
Joan Jett, and all that?' adds Matt.
I think it was Jefferson Airplane,
continues Dan, and then, in an
attempt to confuse me completely,
says Remember that time when my
Y-Fronts were written on by the
brunettes, and then the next day, I
forget I had them on, and I was in
my m u m ' s room and she saw them
and said 'Where have y o u been
without your clothes on?'
At this point we're interrupted
by the return of Toby and Ian
a clue what you're on. Y o u ' r e
hopeless, a hapless fuckwit.
What about Matt o n Thursday
suggests Dan. This girl came up to
Matt after the gig and said ' h o w
much are the T-shirts?', seven quid,
and she said T haven't quite got
enough', and then ' H o w about four
pounds and something special
then?', and Matt spunked in his
pants Matt furiously denied this.
I never did find out if she got the
T-shirt.
4 Pounds & Something Special
Lise Yates
Interviews Herb
it was a woman. I begin to suspect
that this is not a completely true
story. When Toby comes back, ask
him something really deep, like
about 1992 and all that.
What about Freddie M e r c u r y
then? he continues, Let's do
'Freddie's D e a d ' (by Fishbone)
tonight. It's a bit sad really. T o b y
(drummer) used to be in Queen, you
know.
Wasn't it the Blackhearts, you know
(guitar) from McDonalds. Ian
doesn't say much. Toby, on the
other hand, never one to keep
quiet, says...
W e saw the posters on the way up.
They've got written on it 'Herb, the
band who should have supported the
Banderas'. H e y , what's that funny
little tape recorder doing? Is this our
interview? Y o u bastards, y o u
started without me.
He picks it up, and shakes a
burger wrapper at it.
• • H e T t o
What do you think about 1992,
Toby?
I dunno, it's like the year after this
one, isn't it? I'll haven't really
thought about it yet, cos it hasn't
happened yet, has it? I haven't got
Matt is in the toilet now, and
Ian is banging on the door.
Don't bang on the door, Ian, says
Dan. I remember you did that once
when I was about to ejaculate, and
I said I ' m getting a blow job, can
you go away. Where was this?
A t his house!
That's not very sociable, is it? says
Toby.
Not as unsociable as banging on the
door. A r e you recording this? Y o u
bitch!
A n d then on Saturday there were
these two girls, Dan continues.
Matt was looking at these two girls
all through this gig, but they fancied
T o b y , and they went up to T o b y
after the gig, they were going, 'can
we have a free T-shirt?'
A n d I was saying ' n o , no, n o , '
continues Toby and then Matt
comes up behind me and says
'Hello girls, how about some T -
shirts for free?'
Y o u were well out of touch in the
last song on Saturday, T o b y , says
Dan.
W e l l , he responds, that's because
you were all over the shop. It's
alright for y o u , y o u just sing
' Wooohoooooaaaah'
There's no one in the crowd,
says Ian. There's no-one there at
all. H e said when Rain played it was
filled up.
R a i n ? interrupts Matt, w e
supported Rain. There only getting
the gigs because o f those tits o n
their posters and because they're on
Polydor.
I told you it would be like this,
says Toby. W e thought o f ringing
up and saying, you know about this
M o n d a y , well Matt doesn't like
playing on Mondays, so can we do
a Saturday instead.
H o w about a M o n d a y , and
something special, volunteers Dan
W e won't get as many as we did
on Saturday, continues Toby, W e
had a laugh then. There was this girl
at the door, and she said ' Y o u ' l l
have to pay two quid to get i n . ' and
we said, we're the band, you can
tell from our accents, we're Essex
boys.
