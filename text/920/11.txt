Die Fledermaus
Naked women and animals? A t the
Coliseum? W e present sparkle, glitz
and glamour - no, not the opera, but
C H A M P A G N E . Simply add show-
girls, masked balls and more
champagne, as well as a liberal
splash of farcical confusion, to give
this operetta its fizz. With the
amount of dialogue, it is really the
T o a L o n d o n student a market is a
lifeline: cheap food, clothes and
inexpensive presents can keep you
going when the cash refuses to. T o
make the most of your one day
travel card we tour London's best
known markets.
Portobello Road is situated near
Notting H i l l Gate T u b e Station and
is most famous for its antiques
market. This is held on Saturdays
and due to its fame is also packed
with tourists.
The antiques market is at the
south end of Portobello Road sells
a range of tacky 'antiques' and
silverware at reasonable prices but
cashing in are buskers and other
tourist stalls. This part of the market
is also crowded with pickpockets,
so be careful!
T h e further n o r t h a l o n g
Portobello road you go, the more
like an ordinary market it becomes,
selling fruit, veg and second-hand
clothes. A t the top of Portobello
road the stalls merge with those
from Westbourne G r o v e market.
The atmosphere is good but if you
look anything like a tourist, prepare
to be ripped off.
Portobello Road also has the
Electric C i n e m a half way along, as
well as 'Strange Attractors', a shop
musical of 1874, an operetta.
'No-one likes a bat,' but it was
as a bat (die Fledermaus) that D r
Faulke was disguised, had rather
too much to drink and was left to
sleep it off under a bush by his
'friend', Eisenstein. The Doctor
was then left to return home
publicly in costume to m u c h
jeering. This is the story of his
revenge...

charge of insulting a ticket inspector
whilst his wife's ridiculous courter
is perched precariously on the sill
outside waiting for his moment to
dedicated to the art of chaotic
mathematics. The market is open
every day except Thursday and so
is always good for a visit.
One of the world's best known
markets is Petticoat Lane but has
become over popular with tourists
which has changed its character, to
a series of souvenir stalls.
The first thing to remember about
Petticoat Lane is that it doesn't
exist, it is in fact Middlesex Street
and the streets off it and is only
open on Sunday mornings. T h e
nearest Tubes are Liverpool St. and
Aldgate, at the north and south
respectively of the market.
During the winter, the market
doesn't really open until ten o'clock
because it's cold and the store
owners can't be bothered. W h e n it
does open, beware the Tourist stalls
selling U n i o n Jacks and false
policeman's hats. Past this there is
a fruit and veg market and some
second hand army and navy wear
at good prices.

Eisenstein's wife, Rosalinda, is
perplexed by her sonorous suitor,
but seizes her chance for a night
with him by allowing her maid,
Adele, the night off to visit her
'dying' aunt. These deceits are just
a ploy, by all, including Eisenstein,
to secretly attend the ball that night
held by Prince Orlofsky. A s may be
supposed, much comic foolery and
deception ensues as husband and
wife unknowingly flirt with their
partners and assumed identities flow
as freely as the champagne.
The production is everything that
stars are born for. Feathered
chorus-girls abound as does the
glitter a n d , o f c o u r s e , the
champagne. T h e audience do not
escape this p a n t o m i m e . T h e
Prince's pet gorilla certainly startled
most people in the front rows.
Fenella Fielding (yes, that's her real
name) provided an enlightening
interval course in ' H o w T o Prepare
ApfelstrudeT (...and here is one I
prepared earlier, with the obligatory
wine - or was it Wien?) and we
were cajoled through a game-show
board into wearing masks. It was
only to hide our identities and
prevent incrimination following the
Petticoat Lane famous is at the
Aldgate end of Middlesex street. It
is a marquee covered with leather
and sheepskin wear as soon as you
enter the sellers will descend on you
using the greatest hard sell tactics
in the world to make you buy their
clothes. Stay cool and ignore the
blatant sexism if you're female,
remember they are desperate to sell
to you, not you to buy from them.
Remember to hide your A to Z
again; if anyone thinks you are a
tourist the prices double. A l s o , as
students you look like you're poor;
try and bargain or pretend you don't
have enough money, it can be worth
it.
If you are in Petticoat lane then
if you walk a little further east you
will arrive at B r i c k Lane market.
Here there is no way you would be
recognised as a tourist; all that
people want is your money. Brick
L a n e runs parallel but further east
of Petticoat Lane. T h e tubes, again
north and south of the market, are
Shoreditch and Aldgate East.
particularly wild party that ensued.
Some dreadful character, having
thrust empty bottle into every nook
and cranny of a figurine's anatomy,
had gone so far as to graffiti a
moustache and glasses on her fair

and becomes V E R Y good friends.
The famed Lesley Garrett sings
Adele. The prison officer, at least,
was enticed by her high C ' s and she
strips willingly for him - only to
demonstrate her aptitude for acting,
of course. Her voice is lively and
excitable, if a little forced in the
lower register thus making for a still
more 'musical' operetta. But the
heroine was V i v i a n T i e r n e y
(Rosalinda) with her outrageous
accent and infallible voice. A l s o of
note, if only for his shoddily
disappointing entries, was the
singing teacher (Anthony Mee),
which made the character all the
more hilarious. T h e orchestra was
indeed danced throughout under
A d a m Fischer who made the
inevitable waltz intoxicating as the
girls and pony pranced on.
This is a wonderful show for an
evening of laughter - don't forget
the champagne!
Die Fledermaus continues until
February 10. Tickets cost from
£6.50 to £43 but standby tickets are
available on the day o f the
performance at £4.
T h e market proper extends east
and west of Brick Lane, with its
main body selling standard fruit and
veg and some furniture.
T h e East side is like a junk
market with scrap yards and
children selling their old toys in the
street. There is also a large number
of people selling very cheap items
from large bags. These are not all
entirely legal but if you want a very
cheap cigarette lighter then take
your own risks.
T h e west side contains a lot o f
hardware and sweet stalls. If you
find it, there is also a large bike stall
where the bikes are very cheap
indeed. This may be due to the fact
that most of the bikes are stolen but
that could just be cynicism on my
part.
Another reason to go to Brick
Lane is the number of very cheap
Indian Restaurants and sweet shops
but these are not open on Sunday
when the rest of the market is.
