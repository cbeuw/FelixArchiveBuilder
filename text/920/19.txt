Mighty Seconds
IC II played an important league
match against St M a r y ' s Hospital on
W e d n e s d a y 27th N o v e m b e r .
Captain Rax Muthoo took some
extraordinary measures for the
special occasion. H e drove the
minibus carefully (staying well
clear of diesel pumps), drafted in
footballing supremo Dave Buckle to
replace the injured Nigel Clough
and even convinced the referee to
give a pre-match team talk.
The game itself had a peculiar
beginning, with Imperial's vintage
left-back Stuart Miller experiencing
a V a n Goghian moment of folly.
Not content with blasting the ball
towards his own goal, he passed it
to an oncoming opposition player
after goal-keeper Steve Shilling had
saved his suicidal shot. It took a
defective net, a firm referee and a
conjuring trick from canny E a m o n
M c C a n n to deprive St M a r y ' s of a
legitimate first goal. However, the
opposition's cynical football style,
typical of medical schools, coupled
with a loud and hostile crowd (later
booked by the referee), put the most
intellectual team at IC under
pressure and eventually gave St
M a r y ' s the lead.
In the second half Imperial gained
confidence and composure with
Simon Barry scoring two goals. But
the team dramatically weakened
soon after, when Buckle suffered a
bloody head injury. H e was
sandwiched between two opposition
skulls and had to leave the
battlefield clutching his bucket. IC
were still shocked by the loss of
their heroic warrior when St Mary's
grabbed the equaliser.
Shilling pulled off stunning saves,
Richard Burrows and Ian Finnerty
defended with authority, and Tellis
Botzios fought hard in midfield
enabling Imperial to keep the score
level till the end. After the game
some members of the opposition
kindly offered to medicate Buckle's
injury but this was'politely declined
due to the apparent state of
intoxification o f the f o r m e r .
I r o n i c a l l y , the matter was
eventually stitched up at the St
M a r y ' s H o s p i t a l c a s u a l t y
department.
The 2nds were back at Harlington
on the following Saturday. They
maintained their unbeaten run of
s e v e n matches by defeating
Goldsmiths College III by 6-2 in the
quarter finals of the U L U Upper
Reserves Cup. It was a classic game
of two halves with the score
standing at 5-2 at half time.
There was a forceful performance
by Chris Collinson, while the
recovered M a x Duckworth and
Nigel Clough were a welcome sight
on the.field. M c C a n n was a catalyst
in many passing move which
brought back memories of Holland
1974. Muthoo scored a goal, Jason
Devoys got two (including a superb
lob) and Barry managed his second
hat-rick of the season. Once again
he experienced the magic of the
C u p , and the road to Motspur Park
is just round the corner.
Emphatic Fourths? Conquering VI
Last Saturday saw IC IV complete
the double over IC V in emphatic
style. Piyush scored an absolute
peach of a goal from just outside the
area giving IC IV the lead early on
in the first half. The game saw new
firsts with F e m m i Davis managing
to get a shot on target and a pre-
match talk from the captain that
everyone understood.
I C I V sat on their lead in the
second half rarely venturing into the
other half. Some players such as D
Buckle resorted to time wasting, by
pretending to have a heart attack.
But this proved to be unnecessary
as IC V only managed to get one
shot on target, despite their
territorial advantage.
O v e r the curry at the end of the
game, the team decided that victory
would have been even easier had the
captain included himself in the two
substitutions made at half time. The
captain just smiled to himself and
made a mental note of the number
of penalty points that would be
needed at the club dinner.
Last Saturday I C V I conquered
Royal L o n d o n Hospital II to gain
only their third league victory this
year. Disregarding previous defeats
like 17-0 and 6-1, IC V I played well
to overcome a weakened 10-man
opposition. E v e n with a damp team
kit O m a r Jamal and Sam ' T h e
Greek' K a r a m managed a hat-rick
each while Roy O k e l also scored
two; Ray displayed an amazing
reluctance to ever pass the ball once
he had obtained it, as did James
W i l t o n - E l y .
T h e defence p l a y e d w e l l
throughout most o f the match,
although one outstanding moment
came when T o m Parker placed the
b a l l s u p e r b l y past his o w n
goalkeeper, Dave M c C l u s e , to
score his first (own) goal o f the
season.

League Proposal
O y e r the past term, member
societies of the Overseas Students
Committee have been playing each
other in friendly 11-a-side football
games. A s a result of these matches,
the O S C decided they would
attempt to organise a league for next
term, encompassing all the O S C
societies that would be willing to
participate. A n d f r o m funds
available, they would provide a
trophy and medals for the winners.
However, upon hearing this, I
thought it may be an idea to open
up this league to all members
societies of Imperial College Union
(with the obvious exception of the
football club). If such a league is set
up, it may then be possible to entice
outside corporations to sponsor it.
T h i s would go some way in
alleviating some of the setting up
and running costs of such a league,
whilst also offering the sponsor(s)
a good opportunity to gain a
lucrative advertising market.
The league would most likely
consist of two groups, with the top
two teams from each group playing
it out to find out who would be
Champions. A t present we have
eight O S C societies interested in
participating. Hence there is room
for more teams.
So if you think your society
possess a brilliant football team and
would like to get involved in such
a league next term, then please
come forward. A l l you have to do
is to get in contact with me before
l p m Tueday 17th December. This
can be done by either leaving a
message in my pigeon hole in the
F E L I X office or by electonic mail
(khs@doc or V A X A : : U M A C G 9 7 ) .
M o r e details will follow in future
F E L I X issues.
Khurrum.
