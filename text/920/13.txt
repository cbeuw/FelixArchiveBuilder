will of the Palestinian people and to
their natural right in their
homeland, and inconsistent with the
principles embodied in the Charter
of the United Nations, particularly
the right to self-determination.
The Arab Palestinian people,
expressing themselves by the armed
Palestinian revolution, reject all
solutions which are substitutes for
the total liberation of Palestine and
reject all proposals aiming at the
liquidation of the Palestinian
problem, or its internationalism.'
United Nations resolution 242
calls for the parties involved in the
6 day war to make peace and allows
double-talk,
distortion and
outright lies of
the PLO
Israel to administer the territories
it occupied in 1967 until a just and
lasting peace in the Middle East is
achieved. W h e n such a peace is
made, Israel is required to withdraw
its armed forces from territories it
occupied during the 6 day war - not
from 'the' territories, nor from 'all'
the territories, but from some o f the
territories. The withdrawal from the
Sinai following peace with Egypt
both proves that, having secured a
peace treaty, Israel is prepared to
compromise on territory, and
fulfills all its obligations under
International L a w . T h e 1979
withdrawal from the Sinai, returned
9 0 % o f the land captured in 1967
to A r a b sovereignty.
Lieutenant G e n e r a l T h o m a s
Kelly, the director of U S Joint Chief
of Staff, said during the G u l f W a r
(Nov 5th 1991) that 'it is impossible
to defend Jerusalem unless you hold
the high ground...I look onto the
'West Bank' and say to myself 'If
I'm the C h i e f o f Staff of the Israel
Defence Forces, I cannot defend
this land without that terrain."
What Kelly was saying is not
new. A 1968 report by the U S Joint
Chiefs of Staff maintained that
Israel could not be defended unless
it controlled a major part of Judea
and Samaria. A n d in 1988, 100
retired U S generals and admirals,
i n c l u d i n g some o f the most
illustrious in the American military,
asserted that the territories were
vital to Israel security.
O f course Messrs W o n g and
Schrag were absolutely right in
stating that there have been more
Palestinians killed in the last three
years than Israelis. T h e P L O have
c l a m p e d d o w n hard o n
collaborators. In fact, over 500
Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Palestinians. That is more
than the total number of Palestinians
killed by Jews and Jews by
Palestinians since the so-called
intifada began. T h e y are right in
saying that it is the State o f Israel
which should renounce violence and
state terror against u n a r m e d
Palestinian civilians.. .perhaps they
are referring to the way K i n g
H u s s e i n o f Jordan massacred
20,000 Palestinians in their uprising
of Black September 1970 which
Israel, along with all other countries
that value human life, did condemn.

on the same scale
watercannons, the same 'weapons'
used by European countries to
control football hooligans. Under
the G e n e v a c o n v e n t i o n any
occupying power has to maintain
law and order in the territories it is
administrating. Israeli soldiers have
to contend with boulders, petrol
bombs, daggers and in some cases,
bullets. If, to safeguard their own
lives, they fire live ammunition,
even into the air, o r are accused o f
indiscriminate use o f plastic bullets
they are arrested and court-
marshalled.
Jewish settlers have as much right
to settle on Jewish-owned land on
the 'West Bank' as they have to
settle anywhere else in the world.
A n y attempt to limit Jewish
settlement on Israeli Government
owned land would be an attempt to
recreate the state of affairs in A r a b
countries today, and what was the
state o f affairs in Europe before the
war, i.e. that of Jew-free zones, and
J e w i s h r e s e r v a t i o n s — g h e t t o s ,

elected Jewish Government could
accept and be re-elected.
W e should address ourselves to
the plight o f Palestinian refugees,
and indeed to all deprived people.
T h e conference in M a d r i d will
hopefully signify a new chapter,
with Israeli Government officials
meeting with Jordanians a n d
Palestinians. It would appear that
progress will be made towards
some sort o f compromise position
mutually acceptable. If Jordan
makes peace with Israel, territorial
compromise is a serious possibility.
This is to be the last article on the
subject of the Middle East that
will be published in Felix this
year. This includes letters. I
understand that the whole issue
causes strong feeling, but only
amongst a small number
personally involved people. It is
precisely because of these two
reasons that all 'debate' on the
subject tend to be irrational,
vitriolic, rhetorical and very, very
tedious.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is far too complicated and too
intractable for it to be given
justice in a dilletante multisubject
newspaper like this one. The only
people who read articles like this
one have almost certainly made
up their m i n d a n d either
completely agree or completely
disagree. I don't honestly think
the vast bulk of IC students could
be bothered to read it.
This article was written rather
badly as well as by hand.
Therefore I do not accept any
criticism of spelling or semantic
mistakes.
