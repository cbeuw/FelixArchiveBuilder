of residence last Wednesday during
strike action by College staff.
Security staff must check any
building before fire alarms can be

were again required to restore

have been blocked if panic had
broken out. D r John Hassard,
Southside warden, said that the halls
were a 'death trap' and questioned
whether, if there had been a real
fire, the residents could have been
evacuated so easily.

A new 'centre for biomedical
sciences' may be built on the
college campus in the near future.
The Institute o f Cancer Research
(ICR) is looking into the possibility
of relocating from the Chester

Road. According to a letter from the
Rector. Sir Eric A s h . to the
Governing Body of the College, the
ICR would like to move onto a

The estimated cost o f such a
project is about £40 million, o f
which slightly less than half would
come from ICR. T h e rest o f the
funding would have to be raised by
the College and Sir Eric said in his
letter that 'the chances o f success'
would be ascertained 'probably by
Easter." It is thought that the new
building might be built in the space
