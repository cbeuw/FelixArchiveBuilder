They sat hunched up in a nearby
tunnel while Carefree explained the
inner system.
'There are three groups of people
in the system. T h e dorks are the
lowest, followed by the geeks, the
schmucks and finally the jocks who
have all the top jobs. The citizens
can change their trend rating by
improving their trend points which
are adjusted after their regular visits
to the party meetings where they
perform rituals such as alcohol
maintain justice.'
'But what about the executives?
the people outside the system?'
'That's what I'm trying to do! I'm
t r y i n g to o v e r t h r o w the
government, to stop their terrible
ways!'
'Yes! I'll help you, I want to
overthrow them too!'
Stress was really pleased. Finally
in this chaos there was something
he could follow wholeheartedly.
Carefree smiled.

retention, fights with electric guitars

have a transport vehicle, they have

jocks: rollerskates, cut away t-shirts

illuminate the system.
She paused and frowned.
' W e don't run the system on our
own.'
'Yes, I noticed the others.'

'That's great! Later I'll take you

Here's a p i l l . '
Carefree pulled out a small red
pill and handed it to Stress. H e
cautiously swallowed it. His eyelids
drooped and he sagged back against
the wall. Carefree popped one in
her mouth and spoke aloud to
herself.
'Wait 'til they find out in the
group that the pale ones are wearing
suits and are at the edges of the
inner system! They'll definitely then
help me overthrow the government
and replace it with someone who'll
stop the menace of the pale ones.'
They both slept, unaware of
reality.
Stress was walking along a big
black metal tunnel. It was slippery
and shiny and he kept falling. He
knew he wanted to get out of this
d i m tunnel to the light beyond but
the faster he tried to go the more he
fell down. But by standing still he
seemed to move towards the end.
There seemed to be something
blocking the exit, letting only a few
shafts of light through. Stress
examined the object. It was a large
sphere with a clock and a sign
reading 'killer chemical cocktail'.
A s the clock ticked to zero, Stress
realised that the object was s bomb
and started running back down the
tunnel. A massive explosion shook
the tunnel throwing him to the
ground. A s he staggered up and
looked behind him he cried out and
ran on. Behind him the pursuit cop
happily gave chase.

Stress turned to look ahead and
found he had already reached the
end of the tunnel and found it was
worse than the tunnel. A s he fell out
and headed to the ground far below
he twisted to see the pursuit cop
leaning out of the tunnel which was
the barrel of the gun of a larger
pursuit cop leaning out of the
tunnel...
T h e laughter of the pursuit cops
deafened him as he hit the gound.

obtained free of charge from Health
Authority Family Planning Clinics.
However, until Spring 1992, the
Health Centre is giving away
packets of condoms. Initially, you
will need to see a doctor or nurse,
but thereafter packets can be
obtained from the Health Centre
reception. T h e 'Free C o n d o m
Scheme' will be used to discover
whether;
1. It is appropriate for general
practice health centres to distribute
condoms.
2. Doctors should be able to
prescribe condoms on the National
Health Service.
T o this end, questionnaires are
being distributed with the condoms.
T h e questionnaires are anonymous
and information cannot be traced to
the respondants. Please help the
Health Centre staff to collect data,
by completing and returning them.
