'last year they were more of an
option'.
Doctor Keith Barnham of the
Physics Department has announced
the results of his research in to an
i m p r o v e d solar c e l l . In the
improved cell thin layers of semi-
conductor material only 50 atoms
thick are added to the surface to
form 'quantum wells' which trap
higher energy electrons than
normal. T h e process is so effective
that a cell with 50 quantum wells
is twice as efficient as one with 30.
The Rag total is now £12,700 and
many people are suffering because
grants f r o m L o c a l E d u c a t i o n
Authorities ( L E A s ) are late. M o r e
thefts occurred including another
N a g a computer, and still no
connecting evidence has been
found.

A fire started in a lift in Southside
at about 2am last Saturday is being
treated as arson by the Police who
investigated the incidence. It is
believed that this incident is the
third attempt to cause a serious fire
in the building in the same location
and possess a serious threat to the
inhabitants of the hall. A letter from
the warden of the halls, D r John
Hassard said that if the fire had been
discovered five minutes later it
would not have been extinguished.
In this instance one end of the hall
was filled with smoke from burning
plastic. Residents are said to be
furious about the lack of safety in
the hall which is a culmination of
faulty fire alarms, missing fire
extinguishers and the presence of
only one security guard.
A dispute has arisen between
some of the clubs and societies
treasures and the U n i o n because of
a document that they must sign
making them liable for fiscal losses
incurred by their organisations. One
treasurer has resigned and three
other people have yet to sign the
document which also includes the
head of each group.
Following the accident last week
during a mascotry attempt all
vehicles are banned from being
used during such an event. A
meeting of the C C U s about the
incident c o n c l u d e d that since
vehicles are 'harder than even
rugby players' they should be
totally excluded from mascotry.
Various other changes have been
made to make the matter more of
a sport rather than a battle and
improve the situation rather than to
end it, as proposed in a letter from
Sir Eric A s h .
Welfare week was a flop. C + G U
attended the L o r d M a y o r ' s Show
and Kate Dalton was elected as their
new H o n Sec. Violence broke out
at last Friday's ' R a i n ' gig and
Graham Lawton, Ents Chairman,
put this down to a long running
dispute between people attracted to
bar extensions when events had
been planned.

Imperial College has been forced to
back down on it's proposed changes
to the College Safety Council
responsible for Health and Safety at
work in all areas of College. T h e
changes which meant overall voting
control lay with Management
nominated representatives only was
found to be technically illegal under
the Government Health and Safety
regulations. T h e procedure was
severely disliked by the trade unions
within college who threatened to
break away and form their own
safety council. Management said
that the council only 'advised' the
Rector so any changes had no real
effect. This reaction was hotly
contested by the unions who
d e c l a r e d that 'Safety is not
negotiable'.
A t the U G M held yesterday less
than 30 students attended posing the
thought that 9 9 . 6 % of the student
body are totally content with the
operation of the Student's U n i o n .
T h e Government announced the
Council Tax as replacement to the
Poll Tax. Police reported dodgy
L S D tabs spiked with strychnine
and the C + G U blood donation
session attracted 109 donors.

Security guards, messengers and
car park attendants currently
employed by the College are to be
replaced by a private firm, it was
announced by Gordon Marshall,
Director of Estates. In a letter sent
to staff by M r Marshall he stated
that due to a 'need to modernise
systems' the College was proposing
to 'contract out of the whole of this
area of operations'. Derek Dollard
of the Manufacturing Science and
Finance Trade U n i o n ( M S F ) called
for the unions to 'shut down this
place on the day of the Governing
B o d y m e e t i n g (4th
December) subject to the result
o f a ballot, o f c o u r s e . ' N o
consultation has yet taken place
with the unions or staff and
although the proposal is now open
to discussion for a period of one
month it was stated that College is
unlikely to change it's decision,
according to Marketing Director
Steven Newbold. Staff may be
redeployed within college or the
University of L o n d o n , allowed to
take voluntary redundancy or have
compulsory redundancy forced
upon them. Sue Sharp, I C M S F
Secretary, said of the situation that
'it didn't look hopeful.
The Fire Brigade were called out
last Friday when Departmental
Superintendent, C o l i n Rogers, set
off a fire alarm to clear the
Mechanical Engineering Building.
M r Rogers was manning the
messengers desk while a trade
union meeting was taking place and
set the alarm off to clear the
building prior to locking up for the
weekend. Sherfield security was not
informed of his method before-hand
and assuming a real alert called the
fire services. M r Rogers told Felix
that 'he did not think anything when
he saw the fire engines, since fire
engines are continually driving up
and down Exhibition R o a d ' and
added that on reflection he was
'acutely embarrassed' and would
'do it better next time.'
The final stages of the Claypond
site is to be sold to Imperial College
Residences P L C (Impress - a B E S
scheme) when building is completed
in about two weeks. T h e Rector
announced that he intends to
guarantee a c c o m m o d a t i o n to
women for the whole length of their
study, even if they live in London.

The Rector, Sir Eric A s h , fielded
questions from students and staff in
an open meeting yesterday. T h e
Rector was accompanied by Angus
Fraser, Gordon Marshall, John
Archer and Steven Newbold, all
from the College hierarchy. People
asked about the financial stability of
the college which was described as
'stable' although the reserves were
'zilch' ^and they questioned the
replacement of security staff. T h e
Rector would not be pressed on this
matter and would not pass it on to
any of the other directors. H e said
that student numbers countrywide
should be increased and that some
working through college was a good
idea, as in the States, adding that
student benefits over the summer
were diabolical.
Staff members of the major trade
unions have voted for strike action
on the date of the Governing Body
meeting on the 4th December to
protest against the colleges proposal
to contract out security and other
services. M a n y academics have
begun to support the dispute and
some, including Professor Bruce
Sayers, D e a n o f C i t y G u i l d s
College, have sent letters to Angus
Fraser, Managing Director, and the
Rector.
Following allegations of drug
peddling in Bernard Sunley House
a j a n i t o r faces d i s c i p l i n a r y
proceedings. T w o students have
also been suspended pending the
result of their tribunal. The warden
of the hall, Linda Donegan released
a statement about the incident and
added that it was her duty 'to
safeguard the welfare of the
students in my trust and also the
reputation of the College'.

Imperial College U n i o n decided at
an E G M yesterday to support the
strike by trade union members on
the 4th December. T h e College did
not see the point to this action and
the Rector commented that it was
'rather bizarre' that students felt
they could achieve anything by not
going to lectures. Further letters
have been sent by academic staff on
the matter and discussion continues
between the various groups - see
news in this issue.
A door to the Union Building was
completely removed by three
members o f the Royal School o f
M i n e s Union by ramming it with a
British Rail trolley, during the night
of a bar extension marking the end
of Rag Week. T h e cost of the
damage is estimated at £400, some
of which is hoped to be reclaimed
from the three students.
Steve Farrant and Paul Thomas
were cautioned by Police during the
Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump
event for Rag. Natwest announced
that their customer service area
w o u l d be e x p a n d e d and
refurbished. T h e drug disciplinary
actions continued and Freddie
Mercury died.
The Felix staff
wish you a
lousy
Christams and
a suicidal new
year.
