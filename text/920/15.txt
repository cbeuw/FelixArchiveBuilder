Seasoning of Good Will
by Alison Pool.
Spare a thought for the festive
season's most prominent victim this
Christmas.
T h e turkey is a relatively late
addition to the list o f factory farmed
species, but now represents the
largest 'growth industry' amongst
meat products. Once considered a
luxury, turkey has become a
convenience consumer product,
largely since it was discovered that
with added colouring and flavouring
it will take the taste o f almost any
kind o f meat, and is cheaper to
produce. In the 25 years up to 1988
annual turkey production in the U K
increased from three million to 33.5
million. Last year the Christmas
market consumed 16.5 million
birds.
F o r those familiar with the
conditions under which most table
chickens are kept, the situation for
turkeys is very similar. In the most
modern units approximately 20,000
birds are reared in one building,
partitioned into four sections o f
5,000 birds. T y p i c a l stocking
densities are 1.25sq ft per turkey up
to 8 weeks old, 2.5sq ft up to 16
weeks and 3.5sq ft over 16 weeks.
These cramped conditions are
nevertheless slightly better than
those for chickens. This is mainly
because turkeys do not scratch
around in the litter which will
therefore degrade more rapidly.
T h e litter is not changed once over
the full 26 weeks.
The foul ammonia-ridden litter
causes burns and ulcerations.
'Genetic improvements' have led to
faster growing and greedier birds
which are fed on a high protein diet
based on soya and grains. Often the
birds' skeleton does not keep up
with this rate of growth, to the point
that 8 0 % o f male breeding turkeys
become lame, suffering irreversible
diseases o f the hipjoints. W e a k
individuals are frequently trampled
to death.
Due to this highly unnatural
e n v i r o n m e n t , t u r k e y s , l i k e
chickens, take out their frustrations
on their neighbours. Left to their
own devices, they will devour each
other. Instead o f addressing the
central problem, the factory farmer
simply adds to the cruelty. Turkeys
are routinely debeaked at five days
using a red-hot blade. Sometimes
the upper mandible is cut back so
severely that the nostrils are
damaged. N o anaesthetic is used
and the process, even if carried out
properly, is thought to cause
immense pain both during, and for
a long while after. Breeding turkeys
suffer the same agony a second time
at 14-18 weeks. Where debeaking
is not carried out, the birds are kept
in near darkness in order to pacify
them.
The modern genetically improved
male turkey is so heavy and broad-
breasted that it is no longer even
capable o f mating with the much
smaller female. Insemination is now
almost e n t i r e l y c a r r i e d out
artificially, causing much pain to
both sexes.
A t the e n d o f their short
'commercial life' (a maximum of 26
weeks for a table turkey) the birds
are transferred to the 'processing
plant'. Simply being uprooted from
such a fully controlled environment
is a shock in itself. The fragile birds
are insensitively packed into crates
aboard lorries which sometimes
offer no protection from the
weather and which may travel
unlimited distances.
A t the processing plant turkeys
are hung upside down by their legs
on a shackle line, and taken o n a
conveyor belt system to their
deaths. T h e law allows turkeys to
be hung in this way for up to six
minutes. A n average breeding male
at the end o f its 'useful' life weighs
601bs, equivalent to an eight or nine
year old child.
Eventually the birds reach a
stunning apparatus. This usually
consists o f a water-bath charged
with a low level electric current.
Some ten to thirty seconds after
immersion in the bath the birds pass
on to the (usually automatic) throat
slitter, before finally being dropped
into a scalding tank.
There is widespread concern that
many birds are not adequately
stunned. E v e n though immobilised
they m a y still be sentient. L o w
voltages o f 80 to 90 volts are used
deliberately because producers
argue that birds d o not 'bleed out'
properly i f they die before their
throats are cut. Slight differences in
size o r minimal movement by the
birds can prevent them from being
stunned at all. F o r the same reasons
the throat slitter m a y m i s s
altogether, o r cut across the skull.
With more than 1000 turkeys
passing through each hour, the
back-up killer is unlikely to notice
all o f these 'accidents', which are,
to v a r y i n g degrees, everyday
occurences. It has to be assumed
that thousands o f birds came to an
agonising end in the scalding tank.
Intead o f wrestling with your
conscience over the roast this
Christmas, why not try one o f the
alternatives? T h e most ethical
solution is, of course, the traditional
vegetarian yuletide feast—the nut
cutlet. F o r those o f us not prepared
to go so far, there remains the
option o f free-range turkeys.
T h o u g h most suffer the same
painful e n d , the quality o f life
leading up to this moment is vastly
superior.
Most supermarkets do at least
stock frozen free-range turkeys at
C h r i s t m a s . T h e most h i g h l y
respected brand for free range
poultry at the moment is probably
'Label Rouge' from France.
Anyone interested in animal
welfare issues should contact the
Environmental and Appropriate
Technology Soceity or the
following organisations:
Compassion in World Farming, the
RSPCA or, regarding poultry in
particular, Chicken Lib. A recipe
for nut cutlets is displayed on the
ENTS noticeboard.
