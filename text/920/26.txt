editorial
This issue has been a complete
nightmare to bring out. Everything
that c o u l d g o w r o n g has -
particularly the front and back cover
which was a stonkingly good idea
but had problems in execution as
you may notice. H a v i n g visited the
circus troupe ' A r c h a o s ' this week
1 have been sorely tempted to run
away with them and meet a firey but
glorious end by flame thrower.
The primary intent o f the centre
page 'Son O f G o d ' section was to
entertain, not to cause offence,
though I ' m sure it has done the
latter as well. I tend to be an
extreme follower o f the notion o f
free speech - that nothing is too
sacred to make fun of. This does not
necessarily mean that I have no
respect for people with religion,
though it does mean I have no
respect f o r r e l i g i o n per se.
Reactions from religious people to
such blasphemy - as they see it - can
range from the acceptance that other
people have different views through
praying for my soul to the totally
ridiculous second hand rhetoric and
bible quoting which is indicative of
a complete lack o f original thought.
I hope that y o u find it fun.
Oh What A Hat He's Got
Fleming Heino has very kindly
aquired a small cotton baseball cap
for me to eat. I am working through
it tiny piece by tiny piece as
anything larger than four square
centimetres at a time gives me
indigestion. A n y suggestions as to
how to ease the eating would be
very handy - I've already tried Pizza
a /a chapeau avec mal a Vestomac
and the popular drink Chapeau
liquidise a la beaucoup de visitations
au toilette. I shall be calling in my
debts when I've finished it.
Revenge of the F i r Cones
The College management has been
heavily criticised in the national
media recently. In addition, the fact
that the security situation went to a
strike is highly indicative o f a
confrontational approach on their
part. T w o letters from concerned
academics have found their way
into the Felix office, the general
tenor o f which indicates that
College management acts in a heavy
handed and overbearing manner.
They seem incapable o f accepting
the validity o f any other point o f
view. Sir Eric A s h told me that in
his view the generalised criticism
which has come his way is o f no use
as it addresses no specific points.
I feel that it is fairly obvious what
these specific points are: the
C o l l e g e a d m i n i s t r a t i o n rarely
communicates with the lower
echelons of College and when it does
it ignores them. Proof? The halls o f
residence have needed better
security for a long time. A year or
so ago there were a series o f rapes
in other college residences, and an
attempted rape at a St. M a r y ' s hall
(Wilson house I believe it was). The
wardens have been asking for more
security as a major priority for ages.
A n d nothing happens. A t the
beginning o f this year a lift was
deliberately set on fire in Southside
- we don't know whether it was a
resident or somebody from outside,
and nor shall we because there were
not enough security guards to keep
unwanted visitors out. The college
day - when the administration was
persuaded to h o l d a student
r e f e r e n d u m they c o m p l e t e l y
i g n o r e d the result. T h e
M a n a g e m e n t ' s r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
o b v i o u s l y i n c l u d e f i s c a l
management, but not to the
exclusion o f all else.
Felix dinner
It seemed like a good idea to
arrange this year's Felix dinner in
a country pub somewhere - at the
moment the prime location is
Chalfont St Giles at the northern
end o f the Metropolitan line in
South Buckinghamshire - and as I
would like to reconnoitre the pub
beforehand but do not have time to
arrange things before Christmas, it
will occur, if it occurs at all, at the
beginning o f next year, and it is
possible that the price o f the meal
will be subsidised with the option
of a mini-bus there and back for
those who require it and a youth
hostel nearby for those who don't.
Chere Marge
Je n ' a i pas essaye la langue
Franglaise pour un longue temps.
Et maintenant pour quelquechose
totalement different
Nous avons un section nouveau
dans ce journal-ci. C e section est
pour tous les pieces de gossip que
vous avez mais que vous ne pouvez
pas mettre dans les actualites. Si
vous avez quelquechose pour y
emplacer c'est possible d'ecrire une
lettre, sans ou avec n o m , et le
mettre dans le hole-de-pigeon avec
'dear M a r g e ' y ecrit dans le Office
de Felix. J'espere que vous le
trouver utile.
Letters
The R a g situation has changed
somewhat since the letter entitled
' R a g Resignation' was included.
M a r c Ellis (Penguin) has become
a c t i n g R a g C h a i r w i t h the
possibility (at the time o f writing)
that he will become Rag Chair once
again though this depends on an
election. Therefore the letter is now
invalid, but unfortunately was
printed before the present situation
arose.
