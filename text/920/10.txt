Curly Sue
Curly Sue (Alisan Porter) is an
adorable child, adopted by Bill
Dancer (James Belushi) who's
taken care of her since birth. They
roam the streets, but they never
steal or break the law (well not the
good laws anyway). T h e y prey on
sympathy, and they get it in the
form of steamy Grey Ellison (Kelly
Lynch), a cold-hearted lawyer, after
staging an accident in a parking lot,
who buys them a meal. Alas, along
comes her boyfriend and that's that,
until Bill later gets knocked down
for real, by the same person. Grey
succumbs to a little voice in her
head (that's right, she gets
suckered), and she takes them
home.
The film centres around he
relationship with them, and slowly
but surely a bond grows. Trouble
comes in the form of G r e y ' s
boyfriend who isn't too hot with the
situation. This is your classic rags
to riches, lost to love tale. T o l d by
John Hughes (who directed and
produced such wonders as Home
Alone, Uncle Buck and Ferris
Buellers Day Off to name a few).
T h e cast is exquisitely chosen.
Alisan Porter being one of the most
talented youngsters I've ever seen,
and the film will really make a name
for her, as Home Alone did for
Macauly C u l k i n .
Everything John Hughes touches
seems to have an air of magic
around it. H e has made quite a
name for himself and he never
disappoints. Curly Sue is no
exception and is destined for fame,
currently N o 1 in the box office in
the States and is bound to be just as
successful here. It doesn't really try
to be as funny as his previous stuff.
Curly Sue doesn't try to make any
pretences about itself—butit's
heartwarming stuff and has John
Hughes stamped all over it.
There is one problem with Curly
Sue—sometimes it can get a little
too sweet and mushy for your
average University students, I'm
warning you here—if you really go
for this (and I must admit to being
inclined to) then you'll lap this up.
Y o u ' l l get a lump in your throat,
tears will come to your eyes. If you
don't or if you decide to go with
someone who doesn't, y o u ' l l have
a shit time. There's always room
for another John Hughes film,
especially around this time of year
when everyone goes a bit soft.
Great for the family, but if you're
hard, give it a miss.

The Liar Witches Abroad
The sleeve says of Adrian Healey
' H e loves the delicious Hugo
Cartwright, but is loved by the less
than appetising Pigs Trotter'. These
are the main influences on the late
adolescent life of a boy who
Stephen F r y seems to enjoy
implying is typical of one in public
school. True or not, he'd know
better than I.
His tastes include fine wine, toast
with lemon curd, an impressive
repertoire of sexual deviances (and
also with other boys) and cricket.
A l l this hardly is preparation for
the time following his expulsion
from school including rent boys,
cocaine and cheating at the noblest
of all games. Even worse, he is then
led into university, a lost piece of
pornographic D i c k e n s , violent
murder, international espionage and
a college fellowship.
It's a book which is annoying for
its chronological fragmentation and
excessively self-indulgent language.
Also it may be a little too blatant for
some homophobic types. Otherwise
it's hilariously funny, unpredictable
and frequently very cringeworthy.
Certainly worth reading.
R o m e o .
The arrival of a new book by Terry
Pratchett is always greeted with glee
by his fans. T h e most recent,
Witches Abroad, is no exception.
The novel treads familiar ground
for those c o n v e r s a n t with
Pratchett's work, using several
characters and situations borrowed
from the earlier books. T h e plot is
simple; three witches must travel to
prevent a mad fairy godmother
from warping the life of a poor
kitchen drudge (Emberella). T h e
humour is dispensed with a heavy
hand and if the jokes fall flat at least
they come in large numbers.
Dedicated followers of Pratchett's
work will no doubt rejoice in all the
panto-style gags and in-jokes but the
casual reader my derive less
amusement from the tired, stale
format and weary reworking of
other stories. This book bears all the
hallmarks of a bored author
pandering to an uncritical audience,
particularly sad considering the
promise of the first books in the
D i s c W o r l d series and the impact
they had. A v o i d this novel unless
you are willing to suspend critical
faculties and reread the earlier stuff.
