E a c h o f the four Constituent
College Unions ( C C U s ) are run in
a similar way to Imperial College
Union (ICU). There is an executive
committee (exec) responsible for
the day-to-day running of the Union
and its affairs. This is made up o f
about eight people, but the top
three, President, Vice President and
Honorary Secretary are perhaps the
most notable since it is they who
wear the regalia and make up the
top of the committee. T h e Exec is
itself responsible to the General
Committee (Gen C o m m ) which is
made up of about thirty people who
are all representatives o f an area o f
the college, be it Departmental

Each C C U gets its own money
and is financially autonomous (that
means it looks after itself). Apart
from St M a r y ' s , all the money
comes in one lump sum from I C U
(about £15,000 although it does
very slightly for each C C U ) . It is
then up to the C C U ' s Finance
Committee to decide what to do
with it. T h e large majority goes to
the Clubs and Societies, particularly
in sporting activities such as rugby.
The remainder is spent on U n i o n

that each union keeps.
The C C U s are essentially arms o f
I C U . each o f the C C U Presidents
is a Vice-President of I C U and sits
on that Executive Committee too.
They not only act in passing on
information from I C U but also in
feeding back opinion from the more
l o c a l i s e d c a t c h m e n t o f the
individual college. This is probably
the most important role o f the
C C U s as far as I C U is concerned
since the sabbaticals have little day
to day contact with students
whereas the officers of the C C U s
are still studying and are much more
in touch with what the students
want.
If you don't know who your C C U
officers are then find out, track
them down and have a chat—what
do you think of the college day,
security strike, etc, etc. T h e best
place to find them is in their C C U
office at lunchtime.
