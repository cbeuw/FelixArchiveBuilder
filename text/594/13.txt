Rugby
Firsts
This game was set to be quite psychological,
as the two teams are to meet again in the first
round of the Gutteridge C u p . Fortunately,
the psychology worked in favour of I C . T h e
conditions were certainly the best one could
have hoped for and the final result was 9-6.
A l t h o u g h I C played a fast game, often
keeping the opposition under pressure, the
game displayed too many blatant inade-
quacies. T h e backs had an unbelievable
inability to finish-offfrom many good breaks
and often caught out in defence due to some
poor positional thinking. T h i s needs working
on belbre the cup game. L i n e philosophy is
essential but quite simple, if only IC's backs
w o u l d believe it.
IC's try was scored by Aston, alter a
controlled push over, the other five points
coming from the conversion of the try and a
simple penalty.
Seconds
This was another good win lor the Second
X V , who are beginning to look and play
more like a proper side now.
T h e match started oil on a low note, with
the opposition intent at beating the team in
every aspect except rugby, and there were a
number of unsavoury moments. T u r n i n g this
to our advantage, wc took the game from them,
and with the forwards w i n n i n g most of the
ball, the backs had plenty of chances to run
at them. T h i s showed, with the half-time
In the s e c o n d half, we c o n t i n u e d to
pressurize them, and it was inevitable that
the team would score more, against what was
now a disheartened side.

' W e should have w o n , " said the despondent
L o n d o n Hospital's C a p t a i n , " i t was just that
they scored twice and then scored four
more!" Unfortunately the poor, misguided
sole also seems to have ignored the multitude
of chances that were once more missed by
Imperial.
There was actually only one team in it
from the start but it took a while before
R i c k a r d forced the first goal home, quickly
followed by a second before half-time. That
first h a l f saw P h i l N i c c o l l s ' r e m a r k a b l e
shooting ability displayed to the full. His
twenty-live yard elfort actually hitting the
corner Hag and an elfort from the edge of the
box that he ended up nearly trapping.
T h e second half saw Dave Dean finally
finding the net with two goals. Niccolls was
once m o r e in a c t i o n as he " r o s e like a
p i l c h a r d " at the far post for a cross but was a
good two feet below the ball and then hit a
screaming volley that travelled all of two
yards before being blocked. W a r d did an
action replay of M u l h a l l last year, neatly
placing the ball over the bar. Niccolls finally
reaped the fruits of his random shooting
scoring oil the inside of the keeper' leap. A t
the other end, Reeve was keeping W i l l i a m s
busy with one of his 'special' back passes.
Finally, A n d y Page capped a much improved
second half performance with a goal from a
suberb glanced header to give us a 'close' 6-0
win!

Thirds
After being defeated 4-0 by the hands of U C
Seconds on Wednesday, I C Thirds stepped
out of the clouds of gloom and laced K i n g s
College Seconds away. T h e early pace was
very last with shooting chances to either side
in the fust half. I C played with the w i n d in
the second half and came very close with
A n d y H a r t l a n d just failing to convert several
chances. Xlick Flanagan, promoted from the
Seconds combined well up front and guest
appearances from Phil L a k i n and J o h n Burns
were very much appreciated. W i t h Chris

Fourths
This hard, last-moving game resulted m a
well earned poinl lot: the fourths.
A n early brcakawav left the Baits back-
lour standing square and Dave M c P h a i l
calmly slipped the ball past the keeper to
score.
In reply. Bails attacked strongly, but the
I C defence, w i t h Steve V e a t s a n d D a v e
K i n d r e d outstanding, did well to prevent an
immediate equaliser.
T h e fourths f o u n d more space in the
s e c o n d h a l l a n d M c N i c h o l a s a n d R i g b y
persistently unsettled the Baits defence while,
at the other end, keeper A n d y Slater dealt
capably when under pressure.
A n unlucky deflection from your corres-
pondent's j a w enabled a Barts striker tc
equalise, but the determined character of the
fourths emerged as the I C side battled on.
T h e midiield men grew in confidence and
began to take control, but there was one tense
moment when Baits had a goal disallowed for
offside.
However, despite creating several good
chances the Fourths could not overcome the
stubborn Barts resistance and ultimately had
to be content with a draw.
T e a m : Slater, Maddy, Heath, Veals, Kindred,
(Madman, McMahon, Dolan, McPhnil, Rigby,
McNicholas.
Sevenths
A t H a r l i n g t o n I C beat St Thomas' H o s p i t a l
Seconds 2-1 but should have won by more.
After a scoreless first half Peter Rodgers
gave I C the lead following a coiner although
the goalkeeper was at fault.
M a r k Lenczner then made one of many
runs deep into St Thomas' penalty area
before being brought down J u l i a n Norley
scored from the penalty.
After this Lenczner, Norley and Fishwick
all went close to scoring before St Thomas'
broke away to score their only goal.

Firsts
O n our arrival at the ground, it came as no
surprise to find that only one of the appointed
u m p i r e s h a d t u r n e d u p . T h e o p p o s i t i o n
having provided a substitute, I C played the
first half under a considerable amount of
pressure and Birkbeck were duly rewarded
with a one goal advantage at half-time. After
the restart, we came increasingly into the
game, and there were Hashes of the team's
true potential. O u r spirits were lifted further
by a coolly taken equaliser shortly before the
end of the game. This was the cue for some
spirited attacking from the home side, who
were awarded a controversial short corner
which they converted well.
T h e scorer was Bansal.
T e a m : Bullet, Riley, Coatesworlh, Parker,
Franklin, Clarke, Bansal, Rao, Bell, Avers, Cray.
Thirds
D e s p i t e the h e l p of s e v e r a l S e c o n d X I
players, the T h i r d X I still managed to put up
a good performance against U x b r i d g e . W i t h
the score at 1-1 just before hall-time, C a p t a i n
A n d y Purdy had the good sense to dislocate
his shoulder before Pete Hughes could get
anywhere near h i m ! Hughes, it must be said,
sportingly agreed to play for the opposition
but then rather unsportingly proceeded to
score twice for them! F'ortunately for h i m this
did not affect the final result with G o r d o n
W y l i e (3) and E d M c G u i r e giving I C a
deserved 4-3 victory to keep up the Thirds
unbeaten run.
