Big Black Book
Hi, I'm back again (after a short illness) in
charge of exposes, scandals, caustic
comment and wry wit! For those unfami-
liar with my previous literary efforts, let
me explain. Mr Smith has wisely allowed
me to continue casting my critical eye
over some of the more unusual and
amusing aspects of College life. If you
have any interesting snippets for me, then
drop a note into the FELIX Office or see
the Editor. He'll pass anything on
(complete anonymity assured, of course!).
Knickers to the DP!
E v e r y b o d y i n t h e U n i o n s e e m s t o h a v e
souvenirs left behind by their predecessors.
M r Smith tells me that the great South
American explorer left behind a lovely cassette
tape entitled Sounds of Sex, presumably to
keep the incoming editor interested during
long nights alone in the office.
But deviancy seems to have reached greater
heights i n the I C U n i o n Office. D e p u t y
P r e s i d e n t B a r n e y M c C a b e d i s c o v e r e d a
c h a r m i n g colour b r o c h u r e i n his b o t t o m
drawer entitled "Fantasy Fashions from East
of E d e n " which Rachel Snee had (carelessly?)
forgotten about. F r o m the amount of time M r
M c C a b e has spent t h u m b i n g t h e glossy
catalogue it is not certain whether he is-
shocked or expecting his lurex stockings! to
arrive at any moment!
Living off the cream ; • *
The legacy of last year seems to have affected
the residents of 1 Wharfedale Street too.
It seems that the current residents were
rudely a w o k e n one m o r n i n g by a n irate
milkman, who wanted to discover the present
addresses of the previous occupants of the
E a r l ' s C o u r t f l a t . T h e s c o u n d r e l s h a d
consumed £35 worth of the poor man's dairy
goods and buggered off without paying/!
The residents in question included non-
other than I C U D P Barney M c C a b e , H o n Sec
M a c r o L e d b e t t e r , R C S U P r e s i d e n t a n d
professional idiot D. Thompson, and the dope-
crazed fiend who runs the R C S J4 van (mainly
over other people).
So a word of warning to these distinguished
members of our community—the men in the
white coats may indeed by coming to take you
away!
Warm Welcome
The welcoming spirit is always strong at the
start of a new year. There could be no better
example than Senior Warden D o n (Kermit)
Monro.
O n discovering that one of the new inmates'
of Weeks Hall listed "Rock music, motorbikes
and playing guitar" as his interests, he was
keen to meet the hapless fresher. A s the new
resident climbed off his machine, wiped the
grease from his hands and removed his helmet
Don leapt forward with a welcoming gesture:
" H i , I've been dying to meet you. You're
interested in everything I'm not!" he quipped.
Underneath the arches
The Deputy President has discovered a new
method for controlling the rowdy masses who
roll out of the Union Bar late at night. His room
is positioned directly above Beit Archway and
on a recent occasion he tested his brilliant
idea. B y becoming brainlessly drunk himself
and leaning over the balcony he found he
could empty the contents of his stomach onto
the unsuspecting masses below with surprising
accuracy.
The only fault is that, more often than not,
he is at the head of such crowds himself.
Q Sailing
The I C team sailed over last weekend for the
"Foot T e a m .Racing T r o p h y " at the Welsh
H a r p . This event is organized annually by
"Castaways" a n d attracts a number of very
strong teams from around the country.
As racing started it soon became clear that
IC was lacking the experience ol some ol the
club teams and lost to very good teams from
Hollingworth Lake S C and Laleham S C ,
eventual winners a n d runners up in the
group I C were sailing in.
T o their credit the team beat all university
style teams. U L 2 , Castaways, and U n i t e d
Hospitals convincingly.
Team: Ajderian, Kennedy, Mills, Redman,
} oimphusband.
Lacrosse
O n Saturday several girls from I C clad with
lacrosse boots and lacrosse sticks (commonly
referred to as 'fishing nets'!) played for U L U
in the South Clubs and Colleges Tournament
held at Motspur Park.
The first team played well, winning two
matches, but suffering narrow defeat against '
Guildford, in an extremely fast match.
The second team had tough opposition
within their group, but their play improved
in each match they played a n d their final
match against Rcigate was very exciting
although U L U found difficulty in scoring.
Thanks to everybody who played, a n d
supporters who absolutely froze watching! If
anybody else is interested in playing lacrosse,
please contact A n n e Wonnacott, Chemistry
2, or turn up to the practice at Motspur Park
on Wednesday, November 4.
W^WaterPol
The club's first match this year was against
Hounslow. The result was an 8-4 defeat, even
so we were definitely not as bad as the score
suggests. I n fact, c o n s i d e r i n g we h a d n ' t
played together since the summer tour, we
played some very good polo. Nick and John
scored impressive goals as did R i c h when he
decided to actually put some ellort into his
game.
Special thanks to Cliff who kept goal with
a busted collar bone and to J i m for taking
us, in that lousy (and expensive) U n i o n
landrover.
Ladies Rugby
For a l l those ladies interested i n playing
rugby there will be a practice on Thursday
lunchtime, meet at 12:45pm in the U n i o n
Lower Lounge wilh kit. Several fixtures have
been arranged for this term already and we
need a team to play them. A l l enquiries to
M a r y Harrington, M E 3 .
