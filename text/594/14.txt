Wardens Places Two
S e n i o r W a r d e n D o n M o n r o has b e e n
uncharacteristically quiet since last week's
editorial. What's up—cat got your tongue, eh?
Anyway, a further thought has occurred to
me on this subject. T h e two S o u t h s i d e
Wardens, Dr Paul Jowitt (Fatmouth/Keogh)
and Dr Henry Hutchinson (Tizard/Selkirk)
have recently taken on added responsibility
when their various halls combined.
H o w e v e r , as w e l l as t a k i n g on the
wardenships I believe (please correct me if I'm
wrong!) that the two wardens have inherited
the warden's places of their predecessors.
Now this means that they now each have six
rather than three places at their disposal.
Admitted they have not exactly taken out new
contracts—merely modified their previous
ones— but the spirit of the Student Residence
Committee directive against warden's places
was quite clear and perhaps the wardens
should be asked to hand these extra places
over.
This situation provides one explanation for
Don Monro's ridiculous desire to have three
w a r d e n ' s p l a c e s in M o n t p e l i e r S t r e e t .
Together with his Weeks Hall places this
would give him six places too! Keeping up with
the Joneses? O r is it the Jowitts?
Montpelier Street •
O h really! Does Nick Morton seriously think
that anyone will be taken in by his letter on
page two? However I'll try to hold back the
laughter and thank Nick for his wonderful hard
work for the Montpelier Street residents that
has resulted in the overwhelming probability of
a rent rebate. G o o d idea sir!
In fact his actions were so dynamic that I

General Reisenschein has decided to give his
support to disarmament week by getting ridof all
his ground-to-ground missiles: already he's
making plans to launch them...
Y o u may remember that in this column last
year I described the town of Quadratsburg
which is divided by its eighteen roads into
sixty-four blocks, arranged in a square. One of
these contained the military headquarters, and
in the four blocks orthogonally (i.e. not
diagonally) adjacent were four ammunitions
dumps.
I say were because this Greek cross shape
was rather vulnerable, and on the advice of
F E L I X readers General Reisenschein bombed
out the ten blocks shown in the diagram,
confident that he must hit the headquarters or
one of the ammunitions dumps.
Quadratsburg has now been rebuilt, and the
headquarters and three of the dumps are in the
same places as before. The fourth dump,
however, has been moved to a new site in a block
adjacent to its old position, and is now next to
one of the other three dumps.
Alas, military intelligence (a contradiction in
terms if ever there was one) has revealed all the
above information to Reisenschein, who once
again is appealing to FELIX readers to show him
how few missiles he needs in order to be
certain of hitting his target, and which blocks
he should aim for.
have christened our glorious leader Action
Man. That seems appropriate.
W h i l s t on that n o t e , are t h e r e any
suggestions for suitable names for other Union
O f f i c e r s or C o l l e g e p e r s o n a l i t i e s — s e n d
suggestions to me by Monday, 1:30pm and I'll
give a list of the most popular and appropriate
names (rude or otherwise).
Staff Meeting
Despite the extensive credits we still need
regular contributors (mainly news reporters).
More staff means larger issues and hence
more room for those extra items like reviews
and cartoons which have been sadly lacking.
Come into the FELIX Office (on the right
underneath Beit Archway) at 12:30pm today if
you are interested in finding out more. Weekly
staff meetings are held at this time.
Business Manager
Marco has outlined the various Union posts
left unfilled on page six, but has left FELIX
Business Manager up to me.
Basically this post involves keeping the
FELIX account books up-to-date, administer-
ing the payment and receipt of money and
preparing financial estimates for next year. It
doesn't involve an enormous amount of time,
but you must be able to see the Senior
Treasurer on Monday lunchtimes and attend
Publications Board. Papers go up in the Union
Lower Lounge this week. It would be wise to
see me if you are interested as I can give you
further details.
Halloween Party
Tonight is the C C U Halloween Party which
includes the sensation Mari Wilson and the
Imaginations—an extremely danceable band
with a "sixties" sound fronted by Miss Beehive
herself. Please try and turn up in fancy dress.
This is the best way to make the party extra-
special, so make the effort (even if it's only a
little mask!).

Last Week's Puzzle
N o answers received to last week's puzzle;
just several letters begging for another week to
work on it. So be it, but let me amplify the hint.
The word normally is deliberately ambiguous. I
mean it in the sense of correctly, properly, in the
necessary manner, and not in the sense of
perpendicular. Y o u may feel that a hint which
says 'write it out so that it makes sense' is
unhelpful to the point of churlishness, and
perhaps you're right. Nevertheless, the hint
does contain useful information, and every
w o r d was carefully chosen when 1 wrote
what I now repeat: try rewriting it all normally.
Good luck everyone!
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. Closing date for both
puzzles is Wednesday 1:00pm, and each puzzle
carries a £5 prize donated by Mend-a Bike.
