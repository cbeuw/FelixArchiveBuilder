A case for disarmament
in United Nations disarmament week
we invited the IC CND Group to state
their views
Saturday, October 24 saw upwards of 200,000 people gather in London
to demonstrate their concern for the escalating arms race and the
deployment of vast numbers of nuclear weapons in Europe by both
N A T O and Warsaw Pact countries. This occured in the wake of a
demonstration of 300,000 in Bonn, and in parallel with one of 300,000 in
Rome. The following day marked the beginning of the United Nations
disarmament week, and saw further record-breaking demonstrations in
Paris and Brussels. So, why this dramatic European-wide movement of
public opinion against the defence policies of both superpowers and the
countries of N A T O ?
Since World W a r II, world politics has been increasingly dominated by
the power struggle between the U S A and the U S S R . This conflict of inter-
ests has" generated an unrelenting C o l d War and arms race which have
gained renewed momentum. "Overkill" has been possessed by both sides
since the early 1960s, thus invalidating the concept of deference as an
explanation for the arms race. The Reagan administration has reiterated
the condition of U S military superiority prior to any negotiation on
multilateral arms reduction. A condition which, when paralleled by the
U S S R , produces an absurd paradox resulting in nothing more than the
escalation of nuclear weapons, and a situation where nuclear war is now
a probability. A probability further enhanced by the likelihood of a
computer or systems failure firing a weapon by accident. In 1980 alone
there were three reported cases of serious faults in the computers that
control the launch of N A T O nuclear weapons.
Reagan has chosen to adopt the tactics of confrontation, involving
massive increases in defence expenditure and the death of detente. His
c o n t r o v e r s i a l statement to N e w Y o r k e d i t o r s w a s only a blunt
reaffirmation of the present willingness of both superpowers to envisage a
" l i m i t e d " nuclear war fought in the E u r o p e a n " t h e a t r e " . F u r t h e r
willingness is illustrated by the adoption of Presidential Directive 59, and
the plans for installing Pershing II and Cruise missiles in Europe, both
initiated by the Carter administration. Reagan's stamp of approval was
added by the e n d o r s e m e n t of the M X missile p r o g r a m , a n d the
insensitive announcement of the revived neutron bomb program on
Hiroshima day. The British government has played its part by agreeing to
site one hundred and sixty Cruise missiles o n its soil, in full knowledge
that they will be entirely under U S control. Furthermore the government
has chosen to update our own "independent deterrent" by the purchase
of four Trident submarines at a cost of £6,000m. A policy which, if
continued, might result in a further cost of £17.000m for the newer
Trident II system.
Present N A T O policy allows for a nuclear war to be fought in the
European "theatre"—but whatever the level of such a war, Britain's
concentration of military targets makes its destruction certain. The U K
government is clearly prepared to persuade people that a nuclear war is
not only thinkable but survivable. The civil defence measures outlined in
'Protect and Survive' are farcical, and must not be allowed to placate a
worried population.
T h i s situation has been reached despite " m u l t i l a t e r a l " a r m s
negotiations dating from the 1950s. The culmination of these, S A L T 2,
still allows a 50-70% rise in the number of deliverable strategic warheads
before 1985 (SIPRI), and S A L T 2 has not been ratified in the U S .
Multilateral negotiations so far have not been a waste of effort. Any
agreement is useful, but their effect on the arms race has been marginal.
This does not mean that we should despair and await the holocaust. We
must analyse why they failed and then find an alternative approach.
C N D propose that Britain should work within Europe to bring about a
European Nuclear Free Zone, the first steps which would be the decision
to ban Cruise and stop the Trident programme, followed by the ;emoval
of all U S military bases. It is important to regard C N D ' s proposals as a
process of disarmament, and not a naive step into the unknown.
The belief that the Communists are poised to overrun the "Free
World" has been repeated time and again throughout the past thirty-five
years until it is now widely accepted. Similar statements, with the roles
reversed, are being fed to the people in the Communis! countries. The
U S S R would be unable to (and why should they particularly want to?)
sweep across a defenceless Europe. The Warsaw Pact's supposed
superiority in conventional forces is aqain something which doesn't bear
scrutiny. T h e numbers game which is played here is misleading,
particularly in view of the deliberate decision of N A T O countries to opt
for efficient, highly sophisticated hardware, as opposed to the (larger
amount of) comparatively basic weapons of the Warsaw Pact. People
must now start to think for themselves. The history of the arms race has
been a history of lost (or often, carefully avoided) opportunities.
Someone must take the first step. Britain has one of the largest
c o n c e n t r a t i o n s of nuclear bases, missiles, a n d weapo n s u p p o r t
establishments in the world. It must scrap A L L nuclear weapons and
bases, and refuse to co-operate with any N A T O nuclear strategy. The
Dutch and Belgians have already refused Cruise. Canada has refused all
nuclear weapons.
There is a large movement building up in Britain supporting unilateral
disarmament: church organisations, trade unions, the Labour Party,
large s e c t i o n s of the L i b e r a l P a r t y , the E c o l o g y P a r t y , a n d a
mushrooming of C N D a n d E N D local groups. T h e movement is
attracting large numbers of individuals of different backgrounds and
beliefs, all of whom share the conviction that the present trend must be
reversed. In time of unemployment, cuts, low investment, and terrible
need in the Third World (see the Brandt Report), it is appalling that
resources are devoted to nuclear weapons. It is essential to start the
steps to survival n o w . Time is running out.
