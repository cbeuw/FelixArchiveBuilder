CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
SF Soc
This is the S F Soc bulletin, mark 2. Mark 1 was
read over my shoulder by the Soc Sec, who
didn't like it so here's the new improved, nice
inoffesnive meally mouthed soft version with
no integrity whatever. I'm not proud. It's a
hard life being a script droid. Droid. There's a
word. Droid. Can't say I like it. Droid. N o , it
doesn't grow on me. I prefer replicant myself.
O h drok. The only things I have to say I'm not
allowed to. So, if any readers feel the influence
of some strange psychic force, it's me trying to
get in touch. M y goodness those burst arteries
hurt.
Newsflash: Arthur C. Clarke in movie-
stardom bid. Yes folks in the new film Village
in the Jungle, the well-known author plays the
part of (a?) judge. S F meets Bloomsbury.
What can we expect to follow this? Thomas
D i s c h in S a t u r d a y Night Fever —II? Ian
Watson in the remake of Fame is the Spur?
Harlan Ellison in Annie? That joke died quickly
didn't it? Is there some stange significance to
the fact that Blakes 7 the Scorpios transporter
will only transmit people into clay pits and their
guns make people jump into puddles? That
A v o n is a l w a y s s h o t a g a i n s t a w h i t e
background when he says "yes"? That he also
gets struck on the back of the head three times
in every episode? Those last two sentences
weren't actually sentences by the way, unless
of course you're American.
Now, a message for all our readers who
happen to be triffids. Tok tok tok thump pok
pok tok clatter thump. O h I forgot, triffids
can't read- (at least, not without moving their
stamens). A h well, time to turn, can't write any
more for personal reasons which I'd rather go
into right now. Life's like that. So long and
leave it to George.
The Cat, the Rat, the Dog and the medium-
sized Bear who lives in the woods.
TM
What's all this then? Some mystical mumbo-
jumbo? Some Eastern religion? Shaved heads,
beads, flower power...? Tying your legs in
knots and contemplating your navel? No 'fraid
not.
Transcendental Meditation (or T M ) is a
simple, natural, effortless mental technique,
practised for fifteen to twenty minutes twice a
day that produces a deep level of mental
relaxation and physical rest.
Since clarity of mind, health and the ability of
decision improves, social relationship are more
enjoyable. O v e r three h u n d r e d scientific
research studies support the psychological,
physiological and sociological changes effected
by regular T M .
Come to an introductory talk and unleash
your mental potential (...better exam results),
enjoy better health (...good for sport) and
improved social relations (...to say nothing of
your love life). T M will help you live life to the
F U L L .
See T M Soc on Wednesday, November 4 at
1:00pm in the Huxley Building, Room 340/1 or
e v e r y M o n d a y at 8:00pm in K e n s i n g t o n
Library.
Mopsoc
O n W e d n e s d a y , O c t o b e r 2 1 , t h i r t e e n
members went to White City to be shown
around the B B C Centre. During our two hour
visit we saw part of the new serial Tenco being
rehearsed: D r W h o was also in operation, but
Top of the Pops seemed to be having a
permanent tea-break (we tried to see that
twice!).
We saw the view a newscaster has whilst
reading the news, and also visited one of the
infamous B B C restaurants for a very welcome
cup of tea.
Altogether we had a very interesting and
informative visit, coming away with information
on jobs, teletext, ways of obtaining tickets to see
productions being filmed, and how to work out
which radio channel plays what.
Trampoline
IC Trampo Club is alive and well, in spite of
being cut out of last week's FELIX. We meet
every W e d n e s d a y from 5:30pm at Q u e e n
Elizabeth's College, Campden Hill Rd (just off
Kensington High Street).
Beginners are always welcome—meet at
Beit A r c h at 5:00pm if you want to be shown

Caynor
Cypriots unite!
This article has two main objectives: to remind
IC students of the Cyprus problem and to
generate interest in formation of a Cyprus
Society in the IC Union.
The invasion of our 'island of love' is now
over seven years old. Time, said to be a healer,
has in o u r c a s e m e r e l y i n c r e a s e d the
intercommunal mistrust and deepened the
wounds of the displaced people, the relatives
of the missing persons and generally of all
p e a c e - l o v i n g C y p r i o t s - G r e e k , T u r k i s h ,
Maronit, Armenian and Latin.
Since antiquity, our homeland has been
dominated by different influences; this has
enabled a rich cross-fertilization of cultures
and a Cypriot identity and character has
d e v e l o p e d . H o w e v e r , r e c e n t h i s t o r y is
threatening our culture and society.
We, as students and young citizens can help
to promote our culture and identity by forming
a national society to cater for our social,
cultural and national needs.
All interested students and staff, come to
Southside Refectory on Tuesday, November 3
between 12:30 and 2:00pm, or sign name and
address on poster in Junior C o m m o n Room.
P l e a s e c o m e to d i s c u s s , s u g g e s t or
participate.
Community
Action Group
A s usual the soup run is on Tuesday and
F r i d a y , 1 0 : 3 0 p m , F a l m o u t h K i t c h e n s ,
transport available back to E v e l y n G d n s .
Anyone interested in draught-proofing homes
on Wednesday afternoons or helping with
handicapped children on Saturday afternoons
come along to the action group's meetings at
12:30pm on Mondays at the top of the Union
Building or contact Sean Coyle, EE3. Also St
Pancras Hospital are asking for volunteers to
help with elderly patients in various activities,
watch out for details in F E L I X and posters
round College.
Firstly a correction to my last article. OK, I admit it, I cocked it up. The
General Committee Meeting is on Tuesday not Monday because (wait
for it) I'm going to a dinner on the Monday.
Anyway, General Committee is the policy making body of RCSU and
consists of all officers and reps. Anybody, however, can attend. So please
come along (ask your reps where and when).
On Saturday last, fifty-seven people from RCS turned out to play
Monopoly around London. Congratulations to the 'Chemcoats' team,
overall winners, and to the 'Mug and Glass' learn who were runners-up.
Our final total was about £200, which may not seem much, but if you
went out lo enjoy yourself rather than to collect, which is the best
method, gaining £4 each and having fun is a good result.
Anyway, this brings our overall Rag total to about £1,150 for this year
There is no Rag stunt this weekend, but instead we have the draw of the
first RCS Rag Raffle, at noon on Saturday in the RCSU Office. So today
is the last day of ticket sales, except from me. Nex! week however,
November 7, there will be the next stunt, so look out for details.
The next Broadsheet will be produced on Wednesday, if you want to
see it out before Christmas Steve probably needs help that afternoon.
On Thursday. November 5, Guy Fawkes, etc., Simon is organising a
trip to the Lewes Carnival to watch the barrel races and fireworks
display. Places are expected to be snapped up. according to Simon
anyway, and thus you should gel your name down early if you want to go.
More details in Broadsheet on Thursday.
