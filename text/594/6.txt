Situations
Vacant
Below is a list of the vacant posts that will be
elected at the next IC U G M on Tuesday,
November 10. Anyone wishing to stand for any
of these posts should put their names up on
the papers in the Union Lower Lounge and
gain the requisite number of seconders to be
eligible for election.
Publicity Officer
The Union Publicity Officer's most important
duty is designing, producing and distributing
posters for I C U General Meetings. Secondary
to that is the advertising of other U n i o n
activites such as marches, demonstrations,
parties. S o u t h s i d e S h o o , etc. A p a r t from
p r o d u c i n g posters the U P O will also be
expected to produce adverts for FELIX and fly
sheets occasionally.
T h e r e are three meetings per t e r m on
average so the work involved is not excessive
but the job is very important in that it a
meeting is not advertised then people will not
turn up to it, plain and simple. The job is not
technically difficult because all the U P O has to
do is produce the artwork and hand it in to
F E L I X and they do the rest. So all that is
required is a bit of imagination and the ability
to get ideas down on paper.
Union Finance Committee
There are two vacant posts on Union Finance
Committee.
The objects of the committee shall be:
The committee shall investigate and give
advice on the finances of Imperial College
U n i o n ( c o n s i d e r a t i o n , d r a w i n g u p , a n d
recommendation of estimates to Council), and
s h a l l a d m i n i s t e r a f u n d , c o n t r i b u t e d to
annually by the Council, for capital expenditure
on equipment.
All clubs and societies grants have to be put
to F i n a n c e C o m m i t t e e for approval a n d
throughout the year all claims for equipment to
be bought or extra money needed for societies
has to be applied for t h r o u g h the U n i o n
Finance Committee. This is a chance for
anyone with a bent t o w a r d s money a n d
financial matters to get involved with the
allocation of the Union grant to the areas they
think most deserving this year.
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e C o m m u n i t y A c t i o n
Group
There are two vacancies for ordinary members
of I C C A G .
"The group shall have for its objects the
p r o m o t i o n ot s t u d e n t a w a r e n e s s a n d
involvement in programmes of community
service and action of all kinds". I C C A G help in
many areas such as evening soup runs to
Charing Cross to feed the homeless, helping
out on Saturday mornings in clubs for mentally
handicapped children, taking part in shows at
l o c a l h o s p i t a l s a n d b u i l d i n g a d v e n t u r e
playgrounds on council estates. Only a few
hours of work need be put in each week but
this is greatly appreciated by the recipients and
gives a great s e n s e of s a t i s f a c t i o n a n d
fulfillment.
Entertainments Officer
This is a new post which will for the first time:
be elected at a U G M whereas previously there
has been an Entertainments Chairman who
was elected from the Ents Committee. The
Ents Officer will chair the Entertainments
C o m m i t t e e w h o will be r e s p o n s i b l e for
organising concerts, filmshows, discos, and
any other events as they deem necessary.
The E n t e r t a i n m e n t s Officer will sit on
Council and so will take a far more active part
in the governing of the Union than previously
and will also be directly accountable to Council
for the organisation of entertainments in
College.
Permanent Working Party
There are four vacancies on P W P two of which
must be occupied by first year students..
The objects of the party shall be:
a) T o investigate any topics referred to it by
Union Council (the managing body of the
Union) or the Executive (President, Deputy
President and H o n Sec of IC Union, plus the
President of C & G Union, President of R C S
Union and President of Royal School of Mines
Union) and shall report back to the next
Council meeting.
b) T o investigate any other areas that it
c o n s i d e r s relevant to IC students a n d to
report, firstly, to a Council meeting and then, if
necessary, to a U G M either in the form of a
report or as a motion.
A s can be seen from the objects of the party
the post of P W P member can encompass any
area of Union life. The P W P has to have a
working knowledge of all parts of the Union
and thus be able to tackle any specific problem
that may arise.
P W P m e m b e r s sit on Internal Services
C o m m i t t e e w h i c h has as its objects the
organisation and development of the services,
both College run and Union run, that are
available to IC students. This year this includes
the Southside Shop which is now a jointly run
U n i o n / C o l l e g e venture and being a new
p r o j e c t n e e d s c a r e f u l m o n i t o r i n g a n d
adjustment over the forthcoming year.
All P W P members also sit on Council and
are thus involved in the makinq of imoortant
policy decisions that affect all students at IC
The time involved is minimal compared to the
knowledge of the working of the Union gained
and the impact that can be made therein.
A P Editor
T h e A l t e r n a t i v e P r o s p e c t u s is a student
publication the aim of which is "to provide, for
the benefit of the potential IC student, an
accurate and balanced view of the advantages
and disadvantages of IC". The A P has articles
on all the departments within IC, written by
the Departmental Representatives, who try to
give an unbiased view of the courses as they
see them. There are also general articles on
the various clubs and societies, facilities
availaable, welfare, accommodation, overseas
students and life in general at IC.
The Editor's job is first to extract these
articles from the people concerned and then to
bring them together to form the final product.
The A P Editor sits as a permanent observer on
Council and is a member of IC Publications
Board which includes the Editor of FELIX,
Editor I C U Handbook, S T O I C Chairman, IC
Radio Manager, and The Phoenix Editor.
Academic Affairs
T h e r e are two posts vacant for o r d i n a r y
members of the Academic Affairs Committee
and the post of Academic Affairs Secretary.
The objects of the Committee shall be:
a) The investigation of the purpose and
structure of the degree system, together with
its means of assessment.
b) The co-ordination of all the Academic
Affairs s u b - c o m m i t t e e s a n d staff/student
committees within Imperial College.
Subjects discussed vary from the perennial
problem of unsatisfactory maths lecturing for
non-maths specialist students, to the Sir Peter
S w i n n e r t o n - D y e r R e p o r t o n A c a d e m i c
Organisation. The post of secretary merely
involves a little more work in the writing of
m i n u t e s a n d posting of notifications for
meetings.
Below is the list of successful parking permit
appeals. Window stickers will be allocated to
these applicants to identify their cars and the
p a r k i n g s p a c e to be u s e d . S t i c k e r s are
available from the Union Office on production
of the Vehicle Registration Certificate and a
Unioncard.
I must stress that with joint applications only
one of the cars must be in College at any time

allocated a space will be unable to park. If
more than one car of a joint application is
found parked in College then the permits will
be removed and reallocated.
Any permit not collected before 5:30pm on
Friday, November 13 will be reallocated.
