Is Industry Boring?
W e , the IC Industrial S o c i e t y ,
think not.
A large proportion of a univer-
sity's ex-inmates enter industry
each year, many with no idea of
ahow a business is run.
T h e first s t u d e n t i n d u s t r i a l
society was set up in 1974, with
help from the national Industrial
Society, with the aim of improving
this situation. There are now over
thirty such groups of which we are
the most active in the country!!
(Fanfare, applause, etc.)
T h e ICIS arranges visits to
different concerns, where we meet
managers and workers; we also
invite prominent figures to College
to outline their organisation and
answer any questions from the
audience.
Social events play a part this
year. For instance, more cheese
and wine evenings and a dinner.
The Gas Rig-last year's most
ambitious event.
The society holds a regular meeting every Friday at 12:30 in C h e m Eng
Concourse (near the Bookshop); anybody is welcome to come along,
pick up a programme of events, join the society (only 50p a year) or just
offer your thoughts.
Finally, our next trip is on Wednesday, November 4, to British Steel,
Sheffield. The next speaker is from British Gas, on Friday, November 6
at 1:00pm in C h e m Eng L T 1 dealing with Energy Policy up to the year
2000.

An alternative view of
Industrial Society
One of the more active and apparently well funded societies in this
College is the student Industrial Society. It presents itself in the form of a
glossy, well produced twenty-four page booklet used in other colleges as
well as Imperial, and a single page insert produced by the local college
branch. The booklet contains numerous photographs, twelve articles of
about a page each, and enough full and half-page advertisements to fill
about a third of the space. The stated purpose of this expensive looking
publicity is to try to make students better disposed towards industry.
Oddly enough the insert is much more strident, almost militant, in tone
t h a n the g l o s s y b o o k l e t . ' T h e i n d u s t r i a l b a s e of B r i t a i n is
disappearing...Industry is important...the driving force behind our
society...Get involved in the dynamic world of industry..." the leaflet says.
There seems to be something like missionary zeal in the determination of
the student Industrial Society that we should all be keen on industry.
What exactly motivates people like Christopher Wilshaw. ICIS
Chairman and author of the leaflet, to get involved in the 'industry is
wonderful' propaganda? One of the articles in the booklet gives us a clue.
U n d e r the heading ' W h a t e m p l o y e r s look for', Geoffrey P r i o r ,
Wandesforde Senior Recruitment Manager for Unilever P L C , writes "It is
perhaps not a coincidence that in the last few years we have recruited a
number of local committee members of a (student industrial) society."
Got the job fixed up yet, Chris?
A s far as M r P r i o r - W a n d e s f o r d e a n d the o t h e r i n d u s t r i a l i s t
contributors to the booklet are concerned there isn't any need for a clue.
In the same article as before we read "...we find quite frequently that
membership of the Industrial Society can be of great assistance in
providing opportunities for developing self-confidence in speaking to an
audience, of (sic) meeting with a range of people outside the university, of
motivating people and running an organisation." In other words, 'these
student industrial society johnnies make good recruits'. »
In another article, some incautious remarks made by Karen Wood,
leader of the Industrial Society Student Campaign, gave some insight into
the real attitudes of industry propagandists. Life outside the university is
referred to as the Rat Race (surely not if you're working in industry,*
Karen?) and she tells us to prepare for the "gruesome reality" of earning a
living. Sir Adrian Cadbury, Director of Cadbury-Schweppes Ltd, includes '
a passage in his article which seems calculated to make people flinch with
horror: "The field which is developing fastest...is the harnessing of.,
remarkable productivity and versatility of bugs to produce protein from*
abundant or waste materials (shit?). Ranks Hovis MacDougall already
have a pilot plant producing microprotein of this kind..." so watch out.
As far as the public aims of the Industrial Society are concerned they
are obviously doomed to failure. The fact that thousands of recruitment
booklets are being produced is an admission that most people don't find
industry particularly interesting or dynamic. Necessary yes, but so are
public lavatories and they aren't very inspiring either. Industry is
concerned with the dull task of keeping us supplied with food, clothing,*
shelter and transport, and making money. A scientist might be involved
with the secrets of the universe, a lawyer or doctor with dramatic, even
life-or-death issues, but a factory manager has to find a way of making
cheaper tractor tyres. Cheap tractor tyres are very useful (more useful
than lawyers or scientists) but they don't have any moral, emotional or
intellectual appeal, the sort of appeal which attracts students to industry
wants to employ. The unfortunate fact is that usefulness is not regarded
as a great virtue, and few people feel much urge to be useful to humanity.
They want some status and some glamour, which they might get in the
Foreign Office but not in the hotel or catering trade. Only a flimsy
pretence of usefulness is enough to make a sinecure respectable and
sought after—look at the competition for academic posts.
The Industrial Society might succeed in getting a few more students to
consider work in industry but they cannot make much impact given the;
general attitude towards industry which is partly due to snobbery and
partly to a natural feeling that there can be more to a working life than
making washing machines and financial audits.
