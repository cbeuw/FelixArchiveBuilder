Monro gives in
Probable rebate for Montpelier St
O n T u e s d a y , O c t o b e r 27, the a c t i n g W a r d e n of M o n t p e l i e r
Street H a l l o f R e s i d e n c e , D r D o n M o n r o , held a m e e t i n g w i t h
the H a l l c o m m i t t e e s a n d the m a j o r i t y of residents. A l t h o u g h the
m e e t i n g was p r i m a r i l y organised, so that the w a r d e n c o u l d
discuss the i m p o r t a n t m a t t e r of a rent rebate, w i t h the H a l l
C o m m i t t e e it seems that the w e i g h t a t t a c h e d to this issue b y the
residents d r e w t h e m to the g a t h e r i n g of large n u m b e r s .
A week before this m e e t i n g a p e t i t i o n s u m m a r i s i n g the feeling
of the m a j o r i t y o f the residents h a d been h a n d e d in to the sub-
w a r d e n . T h e p e t i t i o n read:
"lie Ihe undersigned wish lo express our dissatisfaction with
l/ie prevailing conditions in 14 Montpelier .Street. U'e wish to
point out that many of the facilities as promisee/ in the
accommodation literature are either inadequate or absent. In view
of this state of affairs ice feel that the present rent of £23pw is
unreasonable and that some form of compensation should be
forthcoming."
T h i s d o c u m e n t was signed by a c o n s i d e r a b l e n u m b e r ol the
residents. A s w e l l as this p e t i t i o n a letter was also d e l i v e r e d
w h i c h h a d been d r a u g h t e d by the H a l l C o m m i t t e e , listing w h a t
were c o n s i d e r e d as the m a i n deficiences a n d , in the light ol
these, a rent ol £18.50 (the rent for a single r o o m i n Beit H a l l )
was suggested.
A f t e r D r M o n r o h a d r u n t h r o u g h the points raised by the
residents i n the letters, a general discussion took place in w h i c h
all present took part.
A l t h o u g h D r M o n r o seemed to agree w i t h m a n y of the points
it Ix'came c l e a r t h r o u g h the m e e t i n g that a rent rebate was
h i g h l y u n l i k e l y this t e r m , antl that it m i g h t be possible for
residents to a t t a i n this rebate next t e r m . It was also m a d e quite
clear that unless the support of I C U n i o n was g a i n e d the
residents w o u l d not realistically have a c h a n c e of o b t a i n i n g
their rebate.
A m e e t i n g took place at M o n t p e l i e r just after l u n c h o n
T h u r s d a y w i t h N i c k M o r t o n . F r o m the m e e t i n g it seems that
the H a l l C o m m i t t e e have m a n a g e d to g a i n his support.
