EXEC VIEWS
Refectories
This week Council have attempted a survey of people's opinions of
refectories. This survey has been conducted in the refectories so
obviously we have missed the people who don't use them. I invite
comment from the masses out tbere; just drop me a line in the Union
Office outlining why you don't use College refectories.
Bars
November's guest ale is Courage Directors. This will be available in the
Union Lounge and Southside Bars. It will be sold at 50p a pint so make
the best of it.
Cuts
W e have still only sent out a handful of letters to M P s . Please spare us the
five minutes it takes to sign the letter and address it. We have had some
replies from M P s and one or two of those have been quite encouraging.
So we can have some effect and it is worth doing.
O n e or two people have told me about cutbacks in their departments
such as libraries having their opening hours restricted. If anybody sees an
area where standards are suffering from economies, please let me know.
Again you can drop me a quick note in the Union Office.
Waitrose
Apparently there are a lot of Waitrose trolleys around the College. If you
have accidentally forgotten to return a trolley please do so as soon as
possible.
Nick
The teething problems of the new set-up in the shop have almost been
sorted out now; we're ready for new ideas o n things to sell, and sell
cheaply! A n y suggestions should be taken to me in the IC Union Office.
Now's the time to buy slopshirts and T-shirts to take home to the
family at Christmas—don't leave it till the end of term when the money
runs out! A n d don't forget about Grandad's worn out squash racket, get
him a new one and see him smile o n Christmas Day.
