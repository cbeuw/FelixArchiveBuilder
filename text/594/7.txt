Crash! Bang! Wallop!
A report on the C&GU Motor Club Rally
on October 16/17 by Dave Pashley
9:00pm Friday, the air is cold, and the atmosphere tense and
expectant. The ramps whirr and the last car is lowered to the
ground, the marshall's radios crackle as they organise the
exodus of twenty cars and fifty people into the Essex
countryside.
T h e Freshers' R a l l y , t r a d i -
tionally the lirst event in ihe
C & G M o t o r Club's busy year, is
a navigational rally over a testing
100 miles of winding country
lanes. But first each ol the twelve
c o m p e t i n g cars has to pass
scrutincering—a rigorous, on the
spot M o T - t y p e test, one ol the
many safety requirements im-
posed by the R A G which make a
p o t e n t i a l l y d a n g e r o u s sport
relatively sale.
C a r doors slam, engines rev
and everyone heads for the M i l ;
competitors to the start, and mar-
shalls to the various checkpoints
around the route. A light mist
shrouds the countryside, and the
temperature drops to - l . It is the
coldest night ol (he autumn so
far.
The rally, which will last lour
hours, is held over eight time-
c o n t r o l l e d stages. In between
the lime controls (TCs). maimed
passage controls check that the
competitors follow the proper
r o u t e . O t h e r m a r s h a l l s a r e
positioned to check thai ihe R A G
regulations arc observed.
A l 11:31, car number one goes
hurtling off into the night. One
minute later, the second car is
away, and so on until all twelve
cars arc gone, and the frantic
clamour of the start is trans-
formed into an eerie hush.
As this is a navigational rally,
the crews (lo not receive any
route information until the start
of each stage. The emphasis is
ihus very much on navigation;
r e c k l e s s d r i v i n g is s t r o n g l y
d i s c o u r a g e d a n d c o m p l e t e l y

able lo keep a constant check on

is hurt, although the car and the
telegraph pole arc both decidedly
the worse lor wear.

do better on the second leg. The
threatened freezing log has not
materialised, and the night is
now dry. clear, and billerlv cold.
Another car not to reach hall-

The second hall ol the rally
proves less eventful lor most,
all hough one competitor drops
out with mechanical problems,
and another gets very losi and
has to miss out the seventh stage

It's 4:00ani. pitch-black, and a
tiny .unclassified c o u n t r y lane
somewhere in Essex is swarming
with wide-awake people, slurping
collee, and waving their arms
about enthusiastically. The grass
