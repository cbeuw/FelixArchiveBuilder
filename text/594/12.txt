The R i c h m o n d Park Friendly was held last
week in glorious weather, with a cloudless sky
and a cool, gentle breeze. There was a lair
turnout with runners Irom various L o n d o n
colleges participating.
We were most disconcerted, however, lo
hear on our return from the race thai an irate
U G L Captain had paid a visit to ihe U n i o n
Office al 1:30pm, having nol been able to
lind us at College alter he had phoned earlier
to say that they would be arriving at 1:30pm.
We had left at 1:43pm as the coach was
booked for 1:00pm and we could delay it no
longer. H o w e v e r a l l was m a d e clear on
Saturday when the U C L C a p t a i n said that
they had arrived at 1:45pm. three quarters of
an hour later than invited.
T h e Southampton Invitation on Saturday
was also very enjoyable with the rain holding
oil'just until the end ol the race, which was
run along tracks through some beautiful

Fourths
T h e fourth team gave an impressive all-
round performance on Wednesday which
was embellished by eight efficiently laken
goals.
O n an e x c e l l e n t p l a y i n g s u r f a c e at
W a l t h a m s l o w . J o h n R i g b y opened the
scoring, after good work by M c X i c h o l a s . and
h e a d e d a second f o l l o w i n g a corner. A
dipping shot from Dave H a r d y inc leased tin-
lead, but L o n d o n penetrated the IC delence to
score just before hall-time.
In the second half, a cross from the lt-f"t-
wing enabled G l a d m a n to score from close
range and, after a similar well-worked move.
M c M a h o n made no mistake.
The charitable nature of Dave H a r d y and
J o h n Rigby was evident when both missed
penalties, obviously to save L o n d o n the misery
of a defeat bv double figures, as further goals
from G l a d m a n . Heath and H a r d y sealed the
victory.
Sevenths
H a v i n g obviously heard of the 'magnificent
Sevenths' two high-scoring victories the week
before-. Middlesex Hospital Seconds decided
that the- only way to beat IG was to dress as
Indians. So: laces covered in war-paint lliev
proceeded to dominate the Fust half although
IG scored first alter forty-four minutes
through Carlos l.opiz.
However a few minutes into the second
half M i d d l e s e x e q u a l i s e d w i t h a twenty
yard shot. Late in the game they scored two
more goals. I heir second and decisive one-
being a dubious penally. Best for IG were

T h e t e a m e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d at the
hospital ground in a convoy of hackney cabs.
Spirits were high and it did not take long for
the team to develop the right frame of mind.
The linal result was 10-10 and in general
the team gave a creditable performance. IG's
points came in the first hall, M a n z o n i am
K i n g s c o r i n g two tries from c o n t i n u e d
pressure on the opposition's line, and Downs
converting one of them. The back-row of
M c G e c . K i n g and Aston were instrumental
in maintaining a last tempo to the game,
often forcing the hospital team backwards
under pressure. There was only one bad
feature of the game, thai was a static back-
division. Often, poor, slow handling caused
the ball to end up yards behind ils starting
point, against IC's favour. Johns played a
sound game, having switched from scrum-
hall to lull-back.
Seconds
I C Seconds t r a v e l l e d by t r a i n d o w n to
C o b h a m to play St Georges Hospital M e d i c a l
School, bui the long journey was worth il as
ilie encounter produced some very entertain-
ing rugby.
IG started well when some driving forward
play produced a try for Captain Steve Bell.
M a r k Simmons converted il and added a
penalty lo make the score 9-0. The pack were
playing very well during this period but were
let clown bv some unintelligent play from the
hacks.
A stern team talk from Bell al half-time did
the trick and IC had a much belter second
half. A n d y R a l p h , who along with ihe rest
of the back row had a very good game, scored
two tries. The winger. Davies. also scored
one. Unfortunately, none were convened.
IG continued to press strongly but failed lo
m a k e p r o p e r use ol their o p p o r t u n i t i e s

Firsts
D u r i n g the lirsl half of a highly competitive
match. IC managed to pass the stalwart
delence of Pete H u g h e s a n d G o . twice.
Despite- much territorial advantage the Firsts
struggled lo put awav luiilier chances until
midway through ihe second hall, when a four
goal blitz stunned the o p p o s i t i o n . T h e
highlights ol our performance were three
open play goals by Sean 'Jug' Bell and a
short corner conversion by T i m Coatesworth.
T h e scorers were Bell (3), A v e r s (2)
and Coatcsworth.

Hockey team played their lirst match ol tin-
season versus U C H . There- was some excellent
play on behalf ol IC. but unfortunately the
opponents were more- successful and at hall
lime IG was losing 1-0.
Despile ellorls by the Captain to rouse IG
the second hall proved fatal and (In- final
score- was 3-0 lo U C H . However, the last goal
was somewhat c o n t r o v e r s i a l as il was a

The lirst match of the season lor ihc lirst team
brought us out to Egham. Surrey against
R H G . The match started off well, with our
first pair winning in straight sets to love (15-
0. 15-0). 'The rest ol the match was very much
in our favour against a rather inexperienced
R H C side who found no defence against the-
heavy smash shots of H . K . Wong, or the
tactical co-ordination of Lee Y a p and Tony
Lai and the clever dropshots from Pete Smith.
'The linal result was 8-1 lo IC.
The second match of (he season was at home
against U S E , which again started brilliantly
with our first pair winning the first match 15-
0, 15-1. Two England Youth Squad players
(G. Hulllct and S. Willis) were also able lo
play in this match and contributed much lo
the success of the- learn. 'The first match of the
pair. C. Hulllet and S. Chiang, was y e n
difficult as they had not played together
before, though they gained confidence with
time and won their second two matches after
losing their first. 'The same was true of the
pairing of S. Willis and L. Y a p but the lirsl
pair kepi I heir 100% record winning all three
matches in straight sets.
The final result was 7-2 to IC. These- lirst
two results are very promising lor I he rest of
the season and ihe- first learn have a very
good chance of winning the- First Division
