Ist XI TEETHING TROUBLES
UNSETTLED IN E A R L Y MATCHES
Unable to field a " picked " team in the first five matches, due
to injuries, the 1st XI find themselves with only a win against Shore-
ditch and a draw against St. Clement Danes to their name. We
have had a reasonably stable team during the past few seasons, but
this year we find Ourselves rebuilding. The opening match of the
season saw a~first team containing no fewer than five newcomers
to college football. Since this is played with considerably more dash
and speed than average school football, it is not surprising that the
team is taking some time to settle down.
Successive defeats at the hands
of Winchester, Q.M.C. and Read-
ing University have emphasised
this. From now on, however, we
should be able to form some kind
of idea of how much success we
can expect this season. To repeat
last year's good effort is not
beyond us so long as all our play-
ers do their utmost to ensure
stable teams.
On the social side, Chris Horn-
blower has been elected Social
Secretary and promises to be
quite active, having organised the
excellent " Pie and Mash " sup-
per for the freshers.
RUGBY
RESERVE STRENGTH SHOWS
HOCKEY
During their match against Mer-
ton on 12th October, the 1st XI
Hockey team were reduced to
nine men. Captain Kerry Peters
received a badly bruised hand and
goalkeeper Ted Needham had to
have 11 stitches in his lip.
ATHLETICS
Athletic Club Trials have been
redated to prevent a clash with
Morphy Day. They will now be
held at Hurlingham track next
Wednesday, 6th November. The
Winter Championships them-
selves are on the following Wed-
nesday (13th November).
BOXING
The I.C. BOXING CLUB is
re-forming this year. Active mem-
bers are needed at all weights,
especially in the heavyweight
division. All enquiries to Mike
Neville-Polley via the Union rack.
CYCLING
Although l.C. itself has no
cycling club, due to lack of sup-
port, both the captain Colin Cross
and the secretary Steve Colgan of
the University club are I.C. men.
If you are interested in cycling,
either touring or racing, contact
one of them through the Union
rack.
JUDO
After several years of negotia-
tion, the college judo club hope
soon to be the proud owners of a
real Japanese mat. Cost: about
£200. This will probably be used
in the gym on Tuesday evenings.
A slightly altered 1st X V
scored two wins in succession last
week against " F " division (12-5)
and Sutton Swallows (15-3). Team
changes followed our defeat by
Reading University the previous
Wednesday when few people en-
hanced their reputations and the
less said about that the better.
Rain spoilt the game against
" F " division as far as the backs
were concerned, but enough was
seen of them to appreciate the
great potential there.
SUPERIOR FITNESS
There are few real " stars " in
the side though perhaps this is a
good thing. Team work and an
enthusiastic spirit often pay big-
ger dividends, especially when
supported by constant practice
and training. It was pleasing to
see our superiorfitnessshow up
against Sutton when we scored 12
points in the last 20 minutes.
Several freshers are regularly
impressing and knocking on the
1st X V door; G. Rogerson, B.
Elliot, N. Bentley and R. Potts
to mention the best. The team
seems to be settling down now,
JUDO
BEST IN
ENGLAND?
Off to a flying start this season,
the Judo club have already beaten
Kings 4-1 and face their match
against Oxford and Cambridge
with confidence {result in stop
press).
LC. fielded two teams against
Kings at the Fulham Road pad
which is regarded as our competi-
tive home ground. Some of the
club's new members were seen in
action for the first time. The
result shows that they did not
disappoint us. Teams were: (1)
P. Prescott, D. Henton, P. Hall,
R. Jackson. (2) P. Prescott, M.
Kay, R. Done, R. Huff.
A friendly, staged afterwards
with changed teams, was won 3-1
by Kings.
Our Judo Club is now reckoned
to have one of the strongest col-
lege teams in England. Training
conditions are superb. The au-
thorities granted permission to use
the building adjacent to South
Side car park for this purpose and
a mat is permanently laid out
there.
Beginners' instruction, by the
higher graded members of the club
takes place Thursday evenings.
All interested members of the col-
lege are urged to join the club
since it is hoped to turn out two
teams regularly this year and their
strength will depend directly on
the standard maintained in the
club.
thanks mainly to the strength of
the feeder XV's.
For every fresher in, one old lag
must go out and it is hard train-
ing, not past reputations, which
will retain places this year..
EVERY fortnight, in addition
to the 1st XV progress report, we
intend to include a paragraph on
one of the other XV's. This week
we start with the BI's.
Two matches played—two won
(of course) by 20-0 and 11-3.
These convincing victories have
been made in spite of a serious
fitness problem in the team. After
an ugly rumour that a certain
centre had been seen training, he
was " dropped" to the Ex-lst
XV. The quantity of beer con-
sumed has been well up to our
customary level and the singing
(also the match points) has been
improved by the presence of that
well-known Welsh referee W.
(Bill) Jenkins (tenor?). Diplo-
matic relations have also been
set up with the 1st XV.
Bl X V Record to date:
P. 2, W. 2, F. 31, A. 3.
CROSS-COUNTRY NOTES
By Pete Crews
Now that the first few weeks of
term are over, the club is settling
down to its usual stream of fix-
tures.
The U.C. Relay, held on Sat.
12th Oct., was the first opportu-
nity for the U.L. clubs to meet
and size each other up. U.C. put
in three teams, givingeveryone a
chance to run. Joe Fitzsimmons
provided the best time for the
1.8 mile lap, doing it in 9min.
9 sec. In the overall placing the
1st team came 14th, the 2nd 23rd
and the 3rd 35th.
On Wednesday, 16th Oct., we
met King's on our home course
at Petersham and defeated them
fair and square. Both clubs ran
three teams of six and each I.C.
team beat its King's counterpart.
This success was due mainly to
the commendable efforts of the
runners in the middle portion of
the club.
The 2nd U.L. trial was held at
Parliament Hill Fields on Satur-
day, 19th Oct. Not only was it a
match against the Poly Mob but
Leagues I and II ran as well.
Consequently the results were
very complicated and in fact no
official list has been received yet.
However, after the (race, Dave
Reaves, Chris Jones, Pete Crews
and Dave Penfold received invita-
tions to run for U.L. against
Cambridge on Saturday, 26th Oct.
Forthcoming events:
Wed. 30th Oct.
—League I (U.H.)
Sat. 2nd Nov.
—Woodbury Rd., Relay, Exeter
