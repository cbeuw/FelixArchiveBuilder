Schroter reviews the Unions
I feel very strongly that the constituent colleges unions are and
should be the cornerstone of the I.C. Union. A t the beginning of
every year the same questions are raised, is the constituent college
union essential.and is it guiding student activity in the right direction?
Many at I.C., both staff and students, argue that Union Officers are
complacent and that our activities are childish and ever debasing.
Those that level such criticism are not, in my experience, appreciative
of the myriad of things done for them at Imperial nor prepared to take
the opportunity of truly widening their experiences of life.
Y O U A N D Y O U R UNION
The Union exists to provide
camaraderie amongst students and
to offer social, recreational and
sporting facilities which would
otherwise be far beyond the reach
of its members. It must be rea-
lised that at no one time can the
Union cater for the interests of all
its students but its opportunities
are always1
open to those who
genuinely seek them.
SPORTING COMPETITION
ESSENTIAL
Irrthis picture the constituent
college union plays a very import-
ant, but, all too often, overlooked
role. The I.C. Union sets out a
very broad network of general
interests which the college unions
complement with societies such as
the Engineering Society, the
Maths and Physical Society, and
the Motor Club; these societies
are intended to broaden the out-
look of the engineers or scientists
beyond the point where their aca-
demic courses leave them stran-
ded. Sporting competition is
essential to the three colleges and
despite the apparent disparity in
size between Mines, R.C.S. and
Guilds, keen enthusiasm and
rivalry exists between us. That this
spirit is carried over into the I.C.
teams is well known. Surely in a,
unit so large and impersonal as the
University of London intercol-
legiate rivalry in Imperial College
is to be sought after.
we as students must prove our
competence as mature thinking
people. I would be the last to de-
cry "sport" genuine high-spirited-
ness is very much an essential
part of our enjoyment while at
College and something which will
always be remembered. But, the
line must be drawn between this
and actions which cause acute
embarrassment to the general
public and do nothing to promote
the good of Imperial College.
. I trust that the collegiate
system at Imperial will always
be the focus of our social life and
that the ever increasing numbers
living in residence will do their
utmost to ensure this. I don't
know of another college of uni-
versity in England more packed
with capable people.
IV.TUTORIALS
from Another Correspondent
Two quite separate incidents
last week may give a clue to
future education techniques. In
the Electrical department Profes-
sor Cherry has been experimenting
with closed circuit television as a
visual aid to lecturing; he is al-
ready using with considerable
success two screens to show dia-
grams and small pieces of appara-
tus. Ultimately it is hoped to
have a complete closed circuit
link between all theatres and lab-
oratories in the department. The
possibilities are endless. Com-
mented Professor Cherry, " Stu-
dents are now more familiar with
T.V. screens than blackboards."
The second item, but separate
from the above, is Cambridge
T.V. week. During this last week
Cambridge devoted themselves to
experiments with television; this
involved early morning lectures
broadcast to the public and the
various aspects of T.V. in educa-
tion. For one day a closed circuit
link was maintained with I.C. and
during this time a two way semi-
nar was successfully held.
It seems that in the foreseeable
future we may expect a permanent
T.V. link with perhaps two or
more universities — eventually
even with America. Lectures may
be illustrated by apparatus many
miles away, and lecturers will be
able to perform without leaving
the warmth of their studies. A
great new field has been entered
and I.C. is up with the leaders.
I L I K E SPORT
In recent years the autonomy of
the Union has been considerably
reduced by administrative and
academic staff. They have held
the opinion that students are
neither responsible enough nor
sufficiently mature to manage
their own affairs in all spheres.
This trend must cease and things
must return to the state where
students capably control their
present and future. To this end

J E A N C O C T E A U A N D SERGEI EISENSTEIN
" D E A T H IS LIFE B A C K W A R D S "
This term you will have a chance to see the most important films
of two men whose work to create a new art of the cinema has made
their films classics.
On November 8th, at our next show, you can see " ORPHEE "
directed, produced, and designed by Jean Cocteau, who died earlier
this month aged 74. He worked with Diaghilev in Paris on numerous
ballets in his youth. Later he wrote and .produced plays and event-
ually made films. He was a poet from his earliest years—" poet"
applied in its wider interpretation as " creator," not only in literary
fields but in drama and dance like the early Greek poets.
" Orphee " is one of Cocteau's distillation of poetry than any
greatest achievements in any
field. It contains a considerable
amount of autobiographical
material. A l l his life Cocteau
was obsessed by the love of death
" for death is only the reverse of
life." The story, of " Orphee "
concerns a poet's struggle be-
tween his love of Death (personi-
fied as a Princess) and his desire
for life (for his work and Eury-
dice, his wife). It is the key to
Cocteau's' attempt to explain the
nature of man and poet and his
belief that life is only a short
space of time between one death
and the next.
Film is particularly valuable
medium for Cocteau because his
writing is often difficult to trans-
late with any fidelity and there-
fore must remain virtually un-
known outside the French lan-
guage.
" Orphee " contains a stronger
other of his films. It is not slow
like his earlier films when he
tried to " prevent the images
from flowing, to oppose them to
each other to anchor them and
join them without destroying
their relief." Cutting became a
masterly instrument bringing out
excitement or tragedy with
equal success. Here Cocteau's
ideas were similar to those of
Sergei Eisenstein, who made film
" montage "—the contrasting of
shots by editing—a most impor-
tant part of film-making.
We are showing Eisenstein's
1
; st and most important film on
November 22nd. It is " Ivan the
Terrible, Part II," a fascinating
study of the man who became the
first Tsar of all Russia.

brainwash
Dr. W. W. Sargeant put us in
a trance with his talk on " the
Mechanics of Brainwashing and
Conversion." He started by
reading rather rapidly through
his notes to give us a general
background to historic investiga-
tions ; the discovery by Pavlov
that shock could form protective
inhibitions and inverted love-hate
relationships in his dogs; also his
own experiences in the War with
the cure of battle neuroses. He
described how he could produce
an abreaction in the brain by
stimulating the emotion of his
subject above the tolerance level
with physiological, psychological
and biochemical stresses, so that
on collapse all the fixations, illu-
sions and basic ideas had been
removed from the mind, leaving
it susceptible to new suggestions.
He said that the same basic
method for brainwashing and
conversion had been and was
used the world over. John Wes-
ley, using the fear of hell fire on
prisoners at Newdigate was able
to produce dramatic conversions,
which he believed was the " do-
ing of the Lord "; and he cited
Hitler's production of mass hys-
teria, which carried away even
the most intelligent Germans. To
prove his point, he showed us
slides taken near and far : a pic-
ture on a Greek vase; natives
and drums; poison snake hand-
lers ; and pointed out the simi-
larity in the facial expressions.
This was followed by a film of
Kenyan natives and their dances,
slides of witches in England, and
a recording of a negro religious
service. After coffee, Dr. Sar-
geant answered questions for an
hour and a half, questions rang-
ing from police interrogation to
leucotomics. Those of you who
are aiming at a first, a colour, or
a good time, and would also like
to gain a little education, would
do well to remember " Monday
Night is Wells Soc Night."
