Cuba; the Docks; the Berlin
Wall; the Russian-Chinese dis-
pute; Fords; the Common mar-
ket; inflation. These are things
which affect all of us to a greater
or lesser extent. Who is right in
them? What control has anyone
over these events? How are they
inter-related? Why? These are
the kind of topics we discuss, and
the kind of questions we ask and
try to answer in the Socialist
Society.
As scientists we produce the
concepts, the machines, and the
technological ability to feed,
clothe and shelter the world's
population—we could almost do
it now. Yet even in an advanced
industrialized society like our
own, we have not yet learnt how
to put our highly sophisticated
resources to use so that they
benefit everybody to the max-
imum.
Often it is only the scientist
who comprehends fully the po-
tency of what he is producing.
Science influences basically the
programmes a government puts
forward, and these inevitably
affect the scientist—who decides
about research in Space? Or for
Armaments? Or roads? This is
why it is essential for us not to
reject politics as being only for
the politicians.
Socialism deals with the inter-
relations and practical control of
the motivating forces within so-
ciety. And science is one of the
most important of these forces
today. This explains the Labour
MEN OF OUR HALLS
Rt. Hon. Ronald Weeks (1890-1960) first distinguished himself
in 1917 when he won the M.C. and Bar, and the D.S.O. After the
war he returned to Pilkingtons, and became a director in 1928. In
1941 he was appointed Director-General of Equipment at the War
Office and in 1942 Deputy C.I.G.S. After the War he became chair-
man of Vickers and later sat on many other industrial boards, but
his outstanding contribution was in the field of technological educa-
tion where he successfully raised £ 3 | million for the advancement
of scientific education in schools.
Mr. William Selkirk, the well-known mining engineer, who made
generous benefactions to the college, and in particular to R.S.M.
He founded scholarships and also set up the Hall of Residence which
carries his name. He was elected F.R.S. in 1949 and an Hon. Ass.
of R.S.M. in 1956. Mr. Selkirk maintained an active and benevolent
interest in the students of the college, particularly those who em-
barked on the practice of mining engineering overseas.
Mr. Garden ( ) has no obituary.
Party's emphatic demands for its
proper control, and fairer sharing
of the benefits ensuing. " Sign-
posts for the '60's" points out
that 1 per cent of the nation's
population owns nearly 50 per
cent of the nation's .wealth! —
mostly amassed because of the
sheer profitability of utilising
technological innovation — from
the loom to the computer.
Socialist Society supports La-
bour, but there is always much
free debate on Party policy, and
all aspects of the Left. Open
meetings are specially intended to
interest those without deep know-
ledge, while closed meetings
always contain much of esoteric
interest. This Thursday Ian
Mikardo is speaking in General
Studies on " Planning, Controls
and Public Ownership," while
other speakers this term discuss
such topics as America's Colour
Problem and Britain's need for
more and better housing.
Keep an eye on the notice-
boards for times and places.

A FRESHER'S IMPRESSION
OF CAVING
Wearing an odd assortment of
" grotty " looking garb about 25
bearded students, together with
the young ladies, gathered out-
side the I.C. Union in order to in-
dulge in a week-end's caving in
the Mendips on the Fresher's
Meet last Friday.
Most of us squeezed into a bat-
tered van feeling like sardines in
a tin without the oil, and after
a stop at Reading we made our
way to a four star barn which
contained straw, electric light
and all the comforts of hard
living. Here we slept wakened
only by the arrival of other mem-
bers of the club who came later
by private transport.
Caving for the first time is an
experience that is difficult to de-
scribe, for after overcoming the
initial fear of crawling down a
small hole in the ground that
already contains a stream, you
are led through a world that you
had never before imagined
existed. It is filled with gro-
tesque and beautiful formations
of all colours and shapes that
you cannot stop to appreciate
fully because the leader has
meanwhile disappeared round
the next corner saying, "I'll show
you something far more interest-
ing."
We were led most competently
down ladder niches, along crawls,
squeezes, double pots, through
virgins' delights and other sug-
gestive sounding places, no
longer caring how wet or cold
we may have felt because of the
exhilarating feeling of adventure
that led us on to explore an un-
known world.
Perhaps the worst part of the
week-end was the following
morning when those of us who
had not the foresight to bring two
changes of clothes had to put on
our wet things for another day's
caving ; though once down again
and moving this was forgotten
during a less strenuous day of
exploring some smaller caves on
the East Mendips.
The week-end finished at 11.30
p.m. on Sunday when we arrived
at I.C. feeling pleasantly tired
after what, for most of us, had
been introduction to a fascinating
new pastime.

MINORS
COLUMN
The first Union meeting of this
term was held on Tuesday, 15 th
October. On the whole it was
lively and, if we can rub out the
chalk, it is to be hoped a good
example of better things to come.
Spirit was high throughout the
formalities and higher after re-
ports of the healthy state of all
clubs in Mines'. Two highlights
of the meeting were the unani-
mous desire to swap RCS for the
Bedford College and the wish to
invite foreign miners Over for a
weekend at the Union's expense.
This means tightening all belts,
but all voted this a worthy sacri-
fice. The volume of the chant
" Gimme an M " and " cats "
demonstrated the overall fitness
of Minesmen.
This year Mines is big enough
to hold three fresher's dinners and
the first of these, for metallurgists,
was held on 18th October. It was
completely successful even to the
soaking of a few insolent Guilds-
men. It must be reported that
all our guests and most freshers
had a good try at drinking the
yard. All events so far and the
promise of more and better things
to come look like the start of1
an A - l year for Mines.
THE FUGUE AS A
DIALOGUE
Mr. Alec Robertson equalled
the standard he set in his first
talk in his second on the fugue,
given last week. In the first he
explained how meaning and at-
mosphere in music are conveyed
by rhythm and melody. This
theme was amplified in his next
talk, in which he likened the good
fugue to an orderly discussion in
which all the speakers shared
their topic without competing.
The approach to the fugue in
early Church music was illus-
trated by a piece for voice and
instruments written as a tribute
to the Duke of Fenara by the
Flemish Josquin Deprez in the
16th century. Mozart could play
fugues on the piano " out of his
head " and one of the results was
the G-major String Quartet,
which was also heard. Mr.
Robertson also played an extract
from Verdi's Requiem and some
Bartok. He said that the third
talk would be devoted to Brit-
ten's " War Requiem."
