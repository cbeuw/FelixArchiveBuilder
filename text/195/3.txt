SCIENCE IN ART
The Upjohn Company of
U.SA . are staging a truly remark-
able exhibition at the R . C A .
(behind I.C. Union). Called " The
Visual Aspects of Science," it
remains open until 2nd November
(admission free).
Not Only do the exhibits show a
beauty of line and form, but they
are instructive to all levels of the
intellectual scale. The underlying
theme of the show is living cellsâ€”
their structure and function. Par-
ticularly clear models, photo-
graphs and diagrams of cell con-
tents and biochemical reactions
are on view, accompanied by a 12
minute film of the monster model
cell that you may have seen on
T.V. a while back. The centre-
piece is a huge " model brain "
which in a simple manner demon-
strates the complicated workings
of that organ (the unit that works
this is quite impressive too when
one considers that everyone of us
has something of this nature in
our own head).
In short, a thoroughly good
show (with a free booklet on how
the brain works) which no mem-
ber of I.C. should miss.

Professor A . H . Halsey, emi-
nent sociologist and broadcaster,
has lectured at several American
universities including Harvard
and Chicago. He is now Head of
the Department of Social and
Administrative Studies at Oxford
and a Fellow of Nuffield College.
In his first of a series of five
General Studies lectures, Profes-
sor Halsey contrasted pre- and
post-industrial society, illustrating
the change in attitude from class
conflict to strife between the old
and the young.
In his second lecture, having
condensed Marxist Theory into
one sentence (!) Professor Halsey
showed how the five fundamental
Marxist prophecies are not ful-
filled. He finished by saying that
Marx is, nevertheless, the soci-
ologist from whom most can be
learnt about the development of
societies today.
Questions connected with the
lectures should be sent to Pro-
fessor Halsey either at Nuffield
College or through the Touch-
stone secretary.

Wives- drink tea and plant tree
By a Staff Reporter
29th October, 1963
" I'm only waiting for it to
rain," said the Domestic Bursar,
as Lady Falmouth planted a
commemorative magnolia tree
outside Falmouth Hall. Cer-
tainly it was dull, and a little
cool, but the ladies of the " Wives
Tea Club " were there in force.
Earlier, in the relative warmth
of the staff lounge in Southside,
the Rector told the ladies a little
about Lord Falmouth's efforts
for the college, and Lady Fal-
mouth, in her reply, said how
much her late husband loved I.C.
After the ceremonial planting,
2-year old Louise Weale, daugh-
ter of Warden Weale and his wife
Carol, presented a bouquet of red
roses to Lady Falmouth.
At an exclusive interview with
Felix Lady Falmouth had this to
say : " It's all very interesting,
and the recreation rooms are so
good ; also they do need using,
don't they ? " and added, " for
myself, I'm old fashioned, and
don't like the modern design, al-
though its very good of its kind."
Altogether it was a great suc-
cess, although one horticultural
was heard to say, " wrong time
of the year for transplanting, it
won't grow."
Incidentally, should the mag-
nolia survive 18 British winters
it should flower.

from our own Correspondent.
After three weeks of caretaker
Government, the debating society
has a new committee. A mere
57 students were present when
Gordon Hall, formerly of Cardiff
University, was elected President.
In a straight fight with Communist
sympathis^t,' Frank Foulkes, Hall
polled a large majority. The exact
figures, however, were not dis-
closed. Union President Dave
Watson and thwarted Foulkes are
among those who will form the
new committee.
Hall, a garrulous Welshman if
ever there was one, quickly called
his first commitee meeting. Later
he said " we want this society to
be 'aken seriously. It should bp
the voice of the union." Among
his proposals are evening debates.
''This will allow more time for
speakers on the floor " Hall said.
He then suggested that the garbled
and hurried lunch time debates
of the past had contributed to the
disruption of the Society.
Final word from Union Presi-
dent Watson: "It's about time
this thing was put on its feet again
and Gordon Hall is quite capable
of doing just that."
EIGHT PICTURES ON LOAN
TO IMPERIAL COLLEGE
Abstract paintings are admir-
ably often able to command one's
enthusiasm, seldom dismissal. The
new student hostel at Princes
Gardens has eight abstract paint-
ings on loan. In the lower stu-
dents' common room Frank
Avray-Wilson's large almost mon-
ochromatic painting of both vital
and interesting organic forms; very
well suited to the positionrit en-
hances the room. Two other
paintings by the same artist are in
the upper students common room
and snack-bar. The first a smaller
blue painting explores the two
dimensional canvas with great
charm. The second is near the
snack-bar counter painted with
reds and siennas; a feast of colour
and paint drawn with care, pur-
pose and dramatic statement.
Entirely different, is Brian
Fielding's painting in the students
dining room. This large decora-
tive painting has colour which,
applied in natural elegant shapes
is economically balanced. The
appeal of this picture is' enormous
and requires the larger area of the
dining room for viewing. Another
painting by the sam '"\ just
inside the entrance, near the stair-
way to the upper students com-
mon room. It does not, unhappily,
suit its cold concrete wall sur-
roundings. The painting has
broad curves, painted in thin
blue-green, leaving a lot of the
canvas white. In the upper stu-
dents common room Brian Far-
mer's small, forceful and simple
painting is more plastic in ap-
proach than the other paintings
reviewed so far. His shapes are
simple having little organic move-
ment, but are powerful none the
less. Another painting in the east
staff common room by the same
artist in the idiom of the last
painting spoken of, uses a simple
plastic shape in charcoal black.
Having no texture, the paint is
evenly applied in tight, isolated
areas. These paintings are par-
ticularly suited to the interior
design.
The new student hostel at
Princes Gardens is well worth a
visit to see these interesting pic-
tures by four of our younger
promising artists. The architects
are to be congratulated on their
foresight in asking the Redfern,
Zwemmer and A . L A . galleries to
loan one or two pictures. It would
be a good idea to give artists
the opportunity to show here
and give the students the chance
to recognize the artists of today.
There are at present two shows of
our foremost abstract painters in
London.- Rodrigo Moynihan and
Donald Hamilton-Frazer are both
distinguished artists. Would it be
possible to see some of their work
in the new building?
