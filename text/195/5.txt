Dear Sir.

Dear Sir,
There are no grounds for say-
ing that I.C. membership of the
N.U.S. is a dead topic, etc. etc.
SEAN DUNNE.
Unfortunately not! Gentlemen
like yourself will continue to
bring it up.—Ed.
P.S.—Anyone wishing to read
the rest of the above should apply
to the Editor.
Sir,
I felt that the banner headlines
used to introduce the report of
the visit of H.R.H. Princess Mar
garet and Lord Snowden showed
a distinct lack of good taste. They
were all too reminiscent of those
used in the more vulgar parts of
the British press, and as such they
were " cheap " and sensational.
Members of the Royal Family
possess titles. Certain abbrevia-
tions and omissions are accepted.
" Maggi " certainly does not enter
into any of these categories and
so should not have been used.
The Felix Board shows certain
inconsistencies in the material
which it prints. On page two of
the same issue a certain N.J.W.
criticised students, and rightly so,
for being slovenly when tier
Royal Highness walked past
them. Before levelling criticism
at others, however, the Board
should put its " own l
house " in
order.
Felix is published by, and for
the most part bought by, members
of Imperial College. As members
of this College they possess cer-
tain academic qualifications which
make it unnecessary for the Col-
lege Newspaper to indulge in such
sensationalism. The Board, by
using such methods, will lower the
standards of Felix even further.
In the long run it stands only to
lose.
Yours faithfully
Botany HI.
But what if it sells?—Ed.
THEOSOPHICAL
REINCARNATION
A grand total of eight people
turned up at the Society's first
meeting this term to hear Dr.
Lester Smith, F.R.S., thinking
aloud on a scientist's view of
Theosophy. These eight were
treated to a unique and stimulat-
ing talk on meditation, reincarna-
tion, theosophy, and science. A
fascinating discussion followed,
and I for one was suitably impres-
sed. Further meetings of the So-
ciety will be on Buddhism, Chris-
tianity, Hinduism, and Islam.

5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner & Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
— to employ and extend his attainments to the
full.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also have a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre ... all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one type of career —
.
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate
assumes managerial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is usuaf
in a modern industrial complex.
