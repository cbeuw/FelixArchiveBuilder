I am a greenhouse
Cameron
Dr. Cameron was disturbed by a statement, attributed to him,
which appeared in the last issue of Felix. The relevant passage
read :—
" Dr; Cameron then went on to say that since so many students
take no part in Union or sporting activities, because of the organisa-
tion's unwieldly size, the only solution is to start a rival."
When re-interviewed by Felix, he said :—
" You see, I didn't want to convey the impression that I, as
Warden of Tizard Hall, was going to make this Hall into a rival to
the Union. What I wished to draw people's attention to was that
if some section of the Union were not doing its job properly, then
competition would have a beneficial effect."
Because I am plugging the
Hall, it does not mean " ipso
facto," I am against the Union.
The impersonalisation of the
Unions is the main cause of any
malfunction ; also, I think many
people are deterred by the beer-
drinking strongman image pre-
sented at Freshers Dinners and
elsewhere. The idea of the but-
tery hour is to get the residents of
the Hall together. I hope that if
they leave Hall next year they
will come back to these gather-
ings, and will treat this Hall as
a second-time home.
At the moment, the staff are
very wary of becoming engaged
in student politics. We see our-
selves as holders of the ring. I
personally see myself as a green-
house, not planting but propagat-
ing that which grows within the
Hall! It seems to me that I.C.
students are reactionary to
changes, even if they are for the
common good !"

MEWS RESIDENTS
AIR THEIR VIEWS
From page 1
One resident said that all he
had to show for a prolonged
series of such complaints was "an
inane letter from the domestic
bursar who evidently did not care
to bother himself with the
matter."
A further claim made, was that
the college had violated an agree-
ment dating back to the time of
the proposal for the building of
Southside. It was said that the
original plans, and in fact, the
plans held until recently by
L.C.C., had reassured the Mews
residents that the Service Area
would be on the Prince's Gardens.
side of the building. The real
intentions of the college did not
become apparent until the build-
ing was completed.
Noise from the hostels was,
(surprisingly), not generally con-
sidered excessive. Only about 30
per cent, of those interviewed said
they were disturbed occasionally
by drunken revelry at the closing
time of the Ennismore, but re-
garded it as not particularly
troublesome, and anyway inevi-
table.
One tenant was troubled by the
intensity of the strip lighting on
the main staircase, another by
choir practices.
The residents sufficiently far
away from the garbage to be able
to smell Mooney cooking, de-
scribed it as " not really very
nice."
All residents claimed to have
gone through " absolute hell"
during the building of Southside:
falling bricks and articles of
plumbing were apparently com-
monplace. Broken windows,
dented cars, ruined paintwork, all
had to be endured, in addition to
the noise and dirt.
The appearance of the building
was generally considered either
fair or good, and certainly an
improvement on the bomb site
that existed previously. The fact
that it reflected sunlight into the
Mews was universally applauded.
One gentleman who rented a
garage only, for working on his
cars, thought that he really had
no complaints about Southside
whatsoever, and added, "actually
I'm most grateful for it: if it
wasn't for the bogs you've got
there I'd have to go right down
to South Kensington."

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
