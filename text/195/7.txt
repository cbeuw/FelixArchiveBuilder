COUNCIL MEET-its moneyagain
ITS MONEY AGAIN AT COUNCIL
The first Union Council meeting of the session was held on Tues-
day 22nd October. The dire state of Union finances was the sub-
ject of much discussion ; investments had been cut which in turn
will lower income and the position will not improve until more money
is forthcoming from the college. This led to th.' main discussion of
the meeting.
GUILDS B R O K E
Bob Schroter, President of
Guilds, asked for a supplementary
grant of £70 for Guilds. He
explained that the money in the
Union was very short indeed; a
new club had been formed, gen-
eral costs had risen, and money
saved for re-equipping clubs had
been used for other purposes;—
for example the Boat Club had
had no new oars since 1946 and it
was doubtful if the old ones could
be used for Morphy Day. Chris
Tye, R.C.S. President, pointed
out that R.C.S. funds were more
healthy and suggested that greater
savings could be made in Guilds.
He thought far too much money
was spent on social functions.
Nigel Gravette, Mines President,
reiterated Chris Tye's remarks.
Dr. Weale after financial calcu-
lations found that C. & G. did
not receive such a fair proportion
of money as the other colleges.
The President commiserated with
Guilds but also said that all
should live within income if
humanly possible. After further
discussion the supplement was
passed.
N O NEWS
Also discussed was the lack of
I.C. news in Sennet. It appears
that it is impossible for anyone in
I.C. to contact the person con-
cerned in Sennet. News is sent in
but nothing is printed. This
prejudicial attitude of Sennet is
difficult to fathom. I.C. is one of
the largest Colleges in the Uni-
versity but it has one of the
smallest " items per student"
ratio in the paper.
PHOENIX-IN T H E B A L A N C E
Phoenix, the President in-
formed Council, is in a serious
position. Recent issues, he said,
were unsatisfactory, with worth-
less content and lack of compe-
tent management. It is to be
radically altered. Phoenix will no
longer be a literary magazine but
a Journal of the Union and Union
affairs. There will be an issue at
the beignning of next term and if
this is not a success—financially
and in content—publication will
cease.
I.C. MASCOT
Among other points discussed
were more telephones for South
Side; the Refectories—much of
the trouble here could be im-
proved if more staff were avail-
able; the Sports Centre — the
earliest completion date is now
October 1965; and the I.C. mas-
cot. This, apparenly, is a bird
named Phoenix which roosts in
the President's Office.

Central Electricity Generating Bard,
Buchanan House, 24/30 Holborn, London, E.C.1.
An Industry whose rapid expansion as-
sures a challenging and exciting future,
the Central Electricity Generating Board
offers graduates wide scope for research
and development in an extraordinary
diversity of fields.
A/system which demands that the Board's
output shall double every nine years, and
capital Investment greater than any other
single organisation in the United Kingdom
(at present around £ 3 0 0 million annually)
roake a long-term research programme
of the highest Importance.
W e are looking for^he graduate who
wishes to embark on a new line ©f re-
search and to make his own personal
contribution to this programme.
There are vacancies for Physicists, Metal-
lurgists, Mathematicians, Chemists and
Engineers in both fundamental and applied
research. The fields covered Include solid
state physics, nuclear Instrumentation,
fluid dynamics, high temperature chem-
istry, fuel cells, behaviour of materials
under extreme conditions and many
others. The most up-to-date equipment
is provided and staff are encouraged to
publish original work.
There are also opportunities In the opera-
tional side of the industry where a two-year
training scheme is available for Electrical
and Mechanical Engineers and Physicists.
DEPARTMENTAL NEWS
Engineering students distressed
or disillusioned by the cold im-
personality of their work, will
probably be heartened to hear
that the Mechanical Engineering
Department at least, have pro-
duced a device of direct and un-
deniable benefit to a section of
mankind. Dr. Swanson has de-
signed and developed a mechan-
ism that will be of considerable
assistance to the wearers of arti-
ficial limbs. Until recently the
different terminal appliances that
can be attached to artificial arms
to carry out various possible
motions of the human hand
could only be exchanged by the
wearer with some difficulty. With
Dr. Swanson's design the operat-
ing mechanism engages or disen-
gages itself automatically, and
with a minimum of effort.
Professor Spalding, also of the
Mech. Eng. Department, is work-
ing on an improvement in the de-
sign of cooling towers which he
hopes will save the Electricity
Generating Board £120,000 on
every new power station built.
This saving is to brought about
by modifying the shape of the
air-intakes at the base of the
towers. The improved air flow
which results, reduces the height
to which the water to be cooled
has to be pumped; the overall
reduction in the cost per foot of
reduction in this height is of the
order of £40,000.
Dr. DeMalherbe is carrying out
valuable research on the internal
combustion engine in collabora-
tion with the head of the Mech-
anical Engineering Dept., Profes-
sor O. A . Saunders. He is mak-
ing measurements on the thick-
ness of oil films between piston
rings and cylinders and of the
variation in temperature in the
cylinders. His main concern is
to determine at what temperature
and under what circumstances
the oil film breaks down, a fac-
tor which has an important bear-
ing on the life of an internal com-
bustion engine. The measure-
ment of the temperature is neces-
sarily a tricky procedure, and
Dr. DeMalherbe has developed
two devices for the purpose, both
of which have been successful.
One of these is a form of " plati-
num paint meter " which utilises
the variation of resistance with
temperature of a very thin film
of platinum painted on the inside
of a cylinder. The other is a
new form of thermocouple on
which Dr. DeMalherbe is to pub-
lish a paper shortly.
WELLS SOCIETY
APOLOGISES
After complaints concerning
the way the Wells Society went
about forming itself, officials of
the Society saw the Union Presi-
dent. He told them that their
action had been wrong, and that
they should write and apologise
to the S.C.C. Chairman, and then
apply to the S.C.C. in the usual
way.
