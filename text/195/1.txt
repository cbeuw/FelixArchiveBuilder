ROBBINS SAYS O.K.
Thursday, October 24th, was Commemoration Day. This year
, « ..-'. .• the traditional ceremony of presentation of Associates, Diplomas and
Fellowships had special significance in that the visiting speaker was
Lord Robbins whose report on Higher Education had been published
the previous day. After the colourful display of hats and gowns had
been followed by thin excerpts from Prince Igor by the choir, the
Rector presented his report. He spoke briefly on the achievements
of the College over the past year emphasising two points : firstly, the
recruitment of outstanding men to the staff at a time when the
emigration of scientists was prevalent, and secondly the great need
to recruit more wora$n students. "We are a mixed College," said
the Rector, and pointed out that under him the female population
of the College had trebled since 1955. Every encouragement should
be given to double the present figure as soon as possible.
ROBBINS EVADES THE
ISSUE
Lord Robbins killed all specu-
lation about his visit with his
opening words, where he made it
clear that he had no intention of
speaking on higher education.
He apologised to the Chairman
for being present under false pre-
tences. The entire text X>f his
speech concerned Technology
and Economics and their relation
to public policy. It appears that
to see just how the Robbins Re-
port will affect I.C., we shall
have to wait until the Rector's
special lecture on this topic on

It is possible, meanwhile, to
surmise from the summary of the
report, and from remarks in the
press just how we will be
affected I.C. will probably be
known as one of a group of SIS-
TERS (Special Institutions for
Scientific and Technological Edu-
cation and Research) and in this
context will be modelled on its
American counterpart M.I.T.
Whether the much-mentioned
widening of academic horizons
means that further courses will
be added, and whether I.C. will
eventually achieve University
status remains to be seen. At
any rate the possibility appears
much stronger under the above
arrangement, if as suggested the
C.A.T.S. obtain this status with-
out lowering their standards:
then ' Consort University " in S.
Ken. seems a distinct possibility.

SOUTHSIDE SERVICE AREA
"MEDIAEVAL SLUM"
Residents of Princes Gate Mews, at the rear of Southside, who
were interviewed by our reporters, complained that despite £120 per
year rates, they had an outlook little better than a slum. The prin-
cipal cause of discontent was the refuse disposal area which was said
to " smell like a piggery" and to " rival an African village in its
primitiveness," The hostels' garbage, overflowing from inadequate
containers, was kept in a repository which was seldom, if ever, shut
off from the street and the resulting atmosphere was so obnoxious
as to endanger their health and existence. It was also said that of
the constant stream of tradesmen's vehicles that delivered to the back
of the hostel, many were driven down the Mews at such a maniacal
rate as to make the residents fear for their lives.
The College and Hostel authorities were accused of ignoring
complaints, or of " passing the buck from one to another."
