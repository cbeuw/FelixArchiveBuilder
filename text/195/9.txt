GUILDS tx R.C.S.
To-day is Morphy Day, and this is one day in the year when
brown bags are dropped, and blue ink stains are washed away in
the crystal waters of the Thames." As usual, there will be the two
boat races, the Lowry Race, and the Morphy Race, both in the same
general direction (the coxs permitting). Meanwhile on the banks of
the Thames, a large number of Guildsmen will engage in moral com-
bat with a similar quantity of R.C.S. This year the excuse for the
punch up will be nine rubber tyres, which will be casually dumped
exactly half-way between the two bands of gentlemen.
Guildsmen are asked to assemble just inside E l entrance at
about 1.30 p.m., dressed in suitable tear-off-and-throw-away clothing.
After a short lack-of-tactics briefing from General Jones, lisped
in dulcet tones through a small megaphone, the party of some 300
Guildsmen will visit a local L.T. Station, with a view to using public
transport. We shall ultimately arrive at Putney Bridge, after maxi-
mum sport on the train, but with zero annoyance to sporting Lon-
doners who will also have paid for their tickets.
After marching past the Boat
House, we shall continue to the
Field of Combat. Our President
will descend from his Hors de
Combat, and insert a large cus-
tard pie in the face of the enemy.
Custard is not easily removed
from Chris Tye's beard. This is
the signal for the affray. The
President's car needs those tyres,
so we must win! When the
boats go past, cheer loudly, give
all your support to the Guilds
boat. Then they'll row even
faster.
LONDON-BRIGHTON
VETERAN CAR RALLY-THIS
SUNDAY
This is Bo's big day. With all
his brass-work gleaming, he'll be
in Hyde Park ready to roll at 7.0
—7.30 a.m. Many people go
down to see the cars leave—in
pviamas even ! T.V. and Press
will be there, so come and,cheer
Bo as he leaves. A coach or two
will be leaving for Brighton, fol-
lowing Bo down, and giving sup-
port to our good drivers. There
is a luncheon arranged on arri-
val in Brighton.
LORD MAYOR'S SHOW
Sat., Nov. 9th. We have a
patch of pavement halfway up
Ludgate Hill. Last year about
80 Guildsmen stood on this
patch, and enjoyed themselves,
throwing pennies into the bells of
Tubas, thereby stopping sound
(and music) from leaving the in-
strument. This year there'll be a
dozen Spanner-Age Cavemen en-
gineers from Guilds on one of the
floats. If enough money is
thrown at our Cavemen, they can
club together and get something.
We'll start off from E l at about
10.00 and see this historic
pageant.
ARCHITECTS EXPLAIN
Tizard Hall, so far the only active South Side hall, organised
a meeting with the Assistant Architect, Mr. Mullins. In answer to
a question about the bare concrete finish, he said that it was deceitful
to conceal the basic construction ; also it is reassuring to see what
is holding the building up. When Dr. Cameron asked if he would
like his own house to be finished in bare brick he replied that his
bathroom was the only room that was plastered. It was pointed out
that the board concrete finish is just as expensive as a plaster finish
because better quality concrete had to be used. The little holes that
are scattered so profusely around the walls are not ash trays as many
people supposed, but are for decorative purposes.
The L.C.C. Means of Escape lege wanted students to do most
committee refused to allow wood
shuttering in the entrance halls as
this was an additional fire risk,
hence the asbestos notice boards.
They insisted on the balconies
around the gallery floor as an
additional fire precaution. These
balconies have an annoying habit
of reflecting any intimate conver-
sations straight down to the resi-
dents of the mews, so beware!
The size of the galleys was
criticized but apparently the col-
of their cooking in their rooms.
Since then they have obviously
changed their views and have for-
bidden students to cook in their
rooms, but have forgotten to in-
crease the size of the galleys.
Everybody approved of the
colour schemes throughout the
halls except one student who has
a blue counterpane, a green car-
pet, a grey chair and a fawn
curtain.

COMMENT

COUNTER-COMMENT
There are, many Iraqui stu-
dents in this country, including a
number at this college. It seems
that some of them have had their
grants cut or stopped, not be-
cause of academic reasons but be-
cause they or their parents are
alleged to hold political views
differing from those of the Iraqui
government. It is difficult to
find out any more details as the
students (possibly not wishing to
draw reprisals) are unwilling to
discuss the matter. If individual
British students • at this college
went to the Embassy in Queens
Gate and asked to see the Cul-
tural Attache, some light might
be shed on the whole affair.
In a Felix report of Princess
Margaret's visit, £4,000 was said
to have been the cost. This
money was presumably spent for
the benefit of the college, since
H.R.H. cannot have gained much
from the experience. None of
the occupants of South Side, or
members of the college that I
have spoken to seem to feel
better for the money spent on
their behalf, and one fears ulti-
mately at their expense ; the Rec-
tor doesn't look very happy in
the photo either.
It is said that Nigel Gravette
is making plans for " dealing
with the bloke who sells the
Daily Worker outside the Union."
Mr. Gravette is perfectly at
liberty not to buy the paoer; it
seems impertinent to take it upon
himself to protect the rest of the
union from the Daily Worker
sellers' pernicious influence. It
is certainly not the business of
the President of R.S.M. toJnter-
fere with someone not on union
premises, and if Mr. Gravette
fancies himself as a defender of
the Free World, he should not try
to limit the freedom of a political
opponent to express his views!
IMPERIAL COLLEGE
EXPLORATION BOARD
Expeditions, Summer 1964
In recent years requests to the
Exploration Board for grants to
support expeditions have been
outstripping the available funds.
This session the Board proposes
to support fewer enterprises than
in recent years.
To save organisers of expedi-
tions unnecessary work in prepar-
ing proposals in great detail, when
there may be no chance of their
obtaining support, a meeting will
be held in the middle of Novem-
ber to discuss preliminary propo-
sals for expeditions. These should
be submitted as soon as possible
to the • Boards's Secretary (Mr.
P. F. Taylor, Department of
Civil Engineering) and except for
the financial estimates need not
be in great detail.
A further meeting of the Board
will be held before the end of the
term to allocate grants where
appropriate.

I know that Mr. Fuchs is re-
garded with not a little humour in
the College and that some of us
tend automatically to laugh at
the views he expresses. This week
however, I find myself in the
happy position of being in agree-
ment with him. Perhaps this is
because his comments are not
controversial. Nobody I am sure,
will disagree that the Iraqui
Students are getting a raw deal,
if the rumours Mr. Fuchs men-
tions are true. He ought how-
ever, to have quoted his sources
of information before trying to
throw the might of I.C. against
the Iraqui embassy. With a bit
more concrete evidence, Mr.
Fuchs would find me, and I hope,
the rest of I.C., on his side.
It is amusing to read the words
freedom in connection with the
Daily Worker. Two or three years
ago, the then Editor of that paper
(now in the salt mines?) gave a
short talk on Britain under Com-
munist rule at the end of which
were the inevitable questions. One
person (stooge?) asked if the free-
dom of the press would be
maintained—the reply was as fol-
lows: — " Yes, the freedom of
the press was guaranteed; we
would not suppress any paper
unless necessary " . . . Clapping
from front row (more stooges?).
It is time those pseudo Commu-
nists who support the Party
realised what they are helping to
build . . . It will not be enough to
say " We did not realise " . . .
(as Mr. Nehru of India). The
infiltration of Communism must
be fought at its roots.
(The views expressed in this column
are not necessarily those of the
Editor.)
