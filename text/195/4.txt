The Editor,
Felix
Dear Sir,
I am prompted to write this
letter only through sheer force of
circumstances. After reading in
the latest Felix that a survey is to
be made on dining conditions, I
feel I must get my spoke in as a
mere Fresher.
My main complaints concern
the lower refectory in the Union
Building.
1. FILTHY glasses.
2. Cutlery semi-washed.
3. The flat plates on which
the puddings are put radiate heat
quite efficiently. Result: cold.
4. Not enough large trays for
soup-lovers; those of us who are
not trained jugglers are liable to
be dogged by the smell of soup
for the rest of the afternoon.
5. The servers look and talk
as if they have "STOOD
ENOUGH CHEEK from YOU,"
especially one who will not allow
anyone to wait for fish, and an-
otherwho puts peas beside all the
fish and becomes offended if one
wants anything else.
6. Inpenetrable sausages.
7. Chairs which knock every-
one else's elbows.
8. Inpenetrable sausages.
Also those jolly little Swedish
forks in the south-side place chew
up the palm of your hand.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
Many readers may not have
heard of the RCS Electronics
Groups. This group is a branch
of the Maths, and Phys. Society
and covers all interests from
Radio Control to hi-fi.
Last summer it was decided to
receive, and possibly track,
future Russian satellites. A re-
ceiver capable of this has been
built and is working. However,
since the last of the " Cosmos "
series of satellites was launched
some time ago, and there has
been nothing since, it may be
that there is another spectacular
development due soon. If this
happens an emergency meeting
will be called as any information
gained on the first few passes of
a new satellite is valuable.
Anybody who is interested
should come along to- the next
meeting, or contact B. Ray, Phy.
3 {Weeks 25).
Yours sincerely,
B. RAY.

Sir,
I wish to raise the issue of the
publications of this College. Your
own paper might be better were
it printed with greater care and
were the countless irritating mis-
takes rectified; even so it is on
the whole dull.
But what of Phoenix; it appears
irregularly, costs the Union a
great deal of money and has very
little to recommend it. Only the
layout and in the past the cover
designs (these too alas have gone),
were interesting. The poetry is
crude and astonishingly artificial
while the prose suffers from the
same faults; few of the things in it
deserve to be in print, even in
Phoenix. The literary standard
is so low that I can see no excuse
for its continued publication.
Yours,
Pseudo.
Why not do something about it?

Dear Sir,
May we appeal through your
columns to the mass of non-fana-
tical students to contribute their
share to Imperial College spirit.
Very shortly many societies
and clubs will be starting com-
petitions against other colleges
for University trophies, e.g., de-
bating, football, hockey and
rugby, and the presence of a
large number of " supporters "
(even though the technicalities
may baffle them) adds enormous
incentive to the people who take
part and spend hours of their
time practising and preparing.
All events are well published
and, in the case of clubs, free
coaches take people to and-from
the grounds. So there is really
no excuse-—support your Union
because it is your Union.
Yours hopefully,

Dear Sir,
Strange Happenings in South
Side ?
In view of the new regulations
published recently with regard to
discipline, we should like to know
for what nefarious purpose one
of the esteemed wardens of a
South Side Hall was wandering
around Princes Gardens at dead
of night wealding a large brown
mattress ? Later on a blue bed-
stead was found draped over the
newly-planted magnolia tree,
causing much inconvenience to
the only dog resident!
Yours, etc.,
Residents of South Side.'
Dear Sir,
As the annual turnover in
members of the Union is about
one-third, no issue can be deemed
closed as you have recently sug-
gested ("Felix," 194, 16th Oct.
1963), and certainly not that of
the election of the President. If
a decision against the election of
the President by the individual
members of the Union was taken
three years ago, then few remain
today who had anything to do
with that decision.
Further, I fail to see what is
wrong with " the popular hero
being swept into power;" it is,
after all, the goal that most
would-be civilised communities
have been aiming at for at least
two centuries. Most other student
unions in the country manage
their affairs at least as well as we
do, even though operating under
such a crushing burden.
You write "it seems fit that
Council, who appreciate the
duties and responsibilities of a
President rather more clearly than
the average student (sic), should
elect him " and then in your edi-
torial refer to " those in the posi-
tions of highest authority that turn
up night after night in an ad-
vanced state of inebriation ": if
these statements .come from one
and the same person, like H. G.
Wells, I find myself "at South
Kensington, lost and dismayed at
the multitudinous inconsecutive-
ness of everything."
No, sir, there is no justification
for the present method of choos-
ing our President which counts
half as much as the principle of
accepting the responsibility of the
average student. If it could be
shown that our Presidents, in the
year prior to their office, are
schooled to take over the admini-
stration, then I could see some
sense in the method, but this
certainly did not happen for the
past two Presidents at least.
Again, I would concede some
validity in the system if the men
it threw up were exceptionally
able Presidents, leaving behind
them a Union more vigorous,
more relevant and with substan-
tially more people participating in
its affairs than when they took
over; need I say more on this?
It would be fatuous to imply
that popularly elected Presidents
would be giants amongst men, but
that they would carry out their
duties as well as those elected by
the present method cannot be
refuted. Your editorial mentions
the declining power of the Presi-
dent and the Union vis-a-vis the
College authorities, and yet you
fail to see that a President elected
by the whole student body would
be endowed with far more signi-
ficance. At the moment, who can
the President claim to represent?
Finally, any President, however
selected, must have the Executive
behind him, must plead his case
in Council whose decisions have
to be ratified by a Union General
Meeting, before he can achieve
anything. If any stupid decision
can get through this series of
checks, it can do so now.
A student of 21 years plus is
considered fit to take part in the
election of an M.P., yet you
would deny him an equivalent
right within Imperial College
Union. Does Dave Watson really
feel he is more validly the Presi-
dent because he was elected by
Council rather than such obvi-
ously unworthy characters as you
and I, sir?
Yours faithfully,
LES MASSEY.

Dear Sir:
May I return a favor?
Recently, when I was a che-
mistry student at the University
of London, I enjoyed the friend-
ship and hospitality of many
English students as well as those
of other nationalities. They made
my stay in England a very pleas-
ant and memorable one.
Should any of your students
have occasion to visit New York
or to study in the United States, I
would be delighted to offer any
personal service within my means
that might be of help to them.
To avoid any possible mis-
understanding I am neither a
bank president nor a hotel owner
but simply a young college gradu-
ate who has spent several years
working and studying in England,
Spain, Germany and France and
who would like to return some
unsolicited favors and hospitality
extended to 'him.
Faithfully yours,
SIDNEY SIMON.
Sir,
On behalf of all those con-
cerned in the production of the
Late News supplement on 16
October, may I say how grateful
I am that it met with such a good
reception in the College.
An apology is due to many
buyers of " Felix " who failed to
receive the Late News supple-
ment. Being a new venture we
were doing a trial run of 700
copies. I am afraid that there
were many writing errors, and I
hope readers will excuse them in
view of the fact that we lacked
good, quick typists for preparing
our Gestetner skim.
A number of changes have
supplement for this and future
been made to the Late News
issues: its production is in-
creased to 1,700 copies and it will
be distributed with " Felix."
Yours faithfully,
IAN WILLIAMS,
(2nd year Botany).
