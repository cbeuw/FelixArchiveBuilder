guy:
Best of
lolcat
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

This is good isn’t it?
Lots of entries last
week, first entry was at
1.07pm by The Tough
Brets. Well done. The
rest of you feel free to
keep entries rolling in-
try to include a alias
you want to be refered
to as, and what puzzle
you are entering in the
subject title. It makes
the world go round a
little easier. No srsly it
does.
