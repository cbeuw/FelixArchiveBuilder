BUCS cup

Murray & co. Down Under

A
h, the familiar pleasures
of January. Slate-grey
skies and precipitation
that can’t make up its
mind as to whether it
wants to be snow, or rain, or something
in between. Without forgetting to
mention the pervasive and inescapable
COLD. Not so for everyone, though. If
you happen to be a professional tennis
player it is but a matter of rankings and
qualifying rounds before you end up
in Melbourne playing the Australian
Open. Bright, sunny, sweltering Mel-
bourne, I might add. (Of course, you
could be Australian, and actually live
in Melbourne-but that’s not something
I would wish on anyone.)
Understandably, then, Andy Murray
and his compatriots of the pro-tennis-
player persuasion have decided to take
refuge from the weather amongst the
kangaroos (although the one million
pound winner’s prize money might
count for something). With the three
Brits in the main draw managing to get
through to the second round, their time
in Oz might actually be productive.
Murray’s first grand slam, then? I
wouldn’t bet on it. Federer may not be
in the best of form at the moment, but
him nor Nadal can never be written
off. Not to mention US open champ
Del Potro looking to show he’s not a
one-hit wonder, and upstart Nikolay
“Federer-killer” Davydenko looking
for a big win. The women’s draw is
also more interesting than it’s been in
a while, with Kim Clijsters and Justine
Henin both recently back from retire-
ment and shaking the (pretty parched)
field up somewhat.
As much as the public is behind
Murray, though, if he doesn’t win we’ll
probably blame the weather anyway.
IC Snooker at nine-
ball championships
Victor Loi Snooker
The pool season started off with a bang
as ICU Snooker prepared for its first
tournament of the year. With a strong
team for the UPC Nine-ball Pool
Championships, hopes were high.The
team comprised of Kwan Ng, Ryo Kob-
litz and Behnam Najafi and was cap-
tained by Victor Loi. The tournament
started with the Individual Champi-
onship. All our players were fortunate
enough to receive a bye in the first
qualifying round but that also meant
they lacked tournament practice on
the unfamiliar tables.This proved to be
a critical point: of the four players, only
Victor managed to get through to the
last 64 with a 5–0 win over Cardiff’s
Iwan Lewis. Imperial’s fight for an
individual medal came to an unfortu-
nate end with Victor’s 5–3 loss against
Daniel Turner from cue sport stalwarts
Warwick in a match that was riddled
controversy. Putting the disappoint-
ing results in the individual competi-
tion behind them, the team decided
to focus all of its efforts in the team
tournament.
The initial group stage got under
way with a beautiful start for Imperial.
We won our first match against Edge
Hill 3 with Victor’s 5–4 win over Liam

The 3rd round of the BUCS brought a
mouthwatering tie between the flag-
ship footballing sides of Imperial and
Reading University. With both ties
securing promising results in BUCS it
was set to be hard fought game.
Reading, currently 4th in BUCS
South Eastern 2A were the favourites
against the 2nd placed team in 3A. This
showed with Reading early on control-
ling possession making Imperial chase
shadows. Imperial kept their shape and
discipline and were able to contain the
opposition until the 30 minute mark
where a loose ball in midfield initiated
a Reading counter-attack and clinically
making use of their 3 against 2 advan-
tage to open the deadlock.
Imperial responded strongly and
created a number of half chances after
forging runs from central midfielder,
David Hayes.
A disallowed goal by Leslie for a de-
batable foul at the edge of the box pre-
vented Imperial from drawing level at
the 35 minute mark and two minutes
later Reading doubled their lead after a
through ball from the Reading captain
split the Imperial defence and made
the strikers job of finishing easy.
It was 3-nil before halftime after a
speculative set peice fortunately found
the head of the Reading winger.
A halftime team talk by captain Mus-
tapher Botchway and the experienced
members of Patrick McMullen and
Thomas Fryatt rallied the troops to
continue their committment and work
rate and get an early goal to pressurise
Reading.
Three minutes into the half Impe-
rial scored a well deserved goal after
the a teasing cross by William Swain
met Theocharis Tofis who calmly slot-
ted it into the near post of the Reading
goalkeeper.
With the momentum now with Im-
perial, further half chances were cre-
ated, and nullified by the presence of
