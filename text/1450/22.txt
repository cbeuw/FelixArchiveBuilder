A metamorphosis from Gollum of
Lord Of The Rings to proto-punk cock-
ney icon Ian Dury is seamlessly made
by the sterling Andy Serkis in this bi-
opic capturing the trials and tribula-
tions of one of the most unique and
distinctive things to rear its ugly head
in 1977. Perhaps rekindling the spirit
Dury could even be deemed a glamour
role for Serkis after Gollum?
Director Mat Whitecross weaves
together a colourful, raucous, moving
account of Ian Dury, both as the east
end wordsmith who’s witty, frequently
crude but always razor-sharp rhyming
is still revered to this very day, but also
poignantly capturing the difficulties
Dury encountered as a child branded
disabled. Polio ravaged his left arm and
leg when swimming in his early school
days and Whitecross tactfully fuses the
trauma of this event and Dury’s subse-
quent horrific early experiences in an
institute for disabled children, along
with incredibly powerful insights into
Dury’s relationships with his family
and lovers to his unrelenting desire to
succeed as an entertainer.
The film contains strong family in-
put into conveying exactly how spite-
ful a bastard Dury really was, the end
result leading son Baxter Dury to pro-
claim that he ‘bled internally’ upon
viewing Serkis bringing back the ghost
of his father, whilst some members of
the family feel the film does not go far
not enough to expose his grotesque-
ness. Pitching Dury in the most objec-
tive light is a tough task, despite being
a notoriously difficult man when in-
toxicated his charm, humour and in-

44 Inch Chest
From the writers of Sexy Beast (2000),
44 Inch Chest gains cult status for a dif-
ferent approach to a British gangster
movie. Ray Winstone plays Colin, a
broken man who’s been suddenly left
by his wife, Liz (Joanna Walley). Ini-
tially blinded with rage, Colin seeks re-
venge by tracking down the ‘loverboy’
– a young man who has been having
an affair with his wife. He calls upon
several of his ageing gangster friends
to help capture loverboy and keep him
prisoner in an abandoned house in a
dark corner of London.
The film is almost entirely shot in a
single room of the abandoned house.
The minimal storyline leaves the char-
acters to do all the legwork to make
the film half-decent. Fortunately, the
cast is brilliant, and there is sufficient
diversity so your attention shouldn’t
waver too much. The confined space
filled by several 40-something classic
British actors give the film a Reservoir
Dogs meets Full Monty feel, although
unfortunately lacks the real gritty dra-
ma that was expected.
Ray Winstone gives an over-the-top
heartbroken performance, and his
overshadowed by his callous friends.
Be prepared for a tedious masterclass
of the four letter word from all the
individuals, especially Jon Hurt’s bril-
liant character ‘Old man peanut’. The
grumpy old git contrasts brilliantly to
Ian McShane’s suave personality, and
their banter is comical throughout.
Director Malcolm Venville applies his
own bizarre element to the film in an
attempt to deepen Ray Winstone’s dis-
tressed character, but just makes him
look foolish.
Considering most recent British
gangster films involve Danny Dyer
chucking bricks at West Ham fans,
this a fresh change. But in general I
doubt people want to see a bunch of
criminals, well past their sell-by-date,
tirelessly monologing about marital
problems.
Writers Louis Mellis and David Scin-
to last collaboration, Sexy Beast (2000),
is much more memorable than this
one. Only the darkly comic actors save
this film from pure mediocrity.
telligence make for an endearing char-
acter. Whitecross walks this tightrope
between sympathy and contempt im-
maculately throughout, as Dury shines
on stage his desperate, malicious antics
towards his family and friends contrast
purposely creating an immensely ab-
sorbing protagonist.
Intricately told among Dury’s rise to
fame and his subsequent decline are
his relationships with his long-suffer-
ing wife Betty (Olivia Williams) and his
young lover Denise (Naomie Harris) as
they both fluctuate with pure anger
at his selfishness to a loving fondness
of his rare tenderness. However it his
relationship with son Baxter which
provides the most compelling of sub-
plots, Baxter is played by the young
Bill Milner who maturely and splen-
didly complements the wild antics of
his father as he is taken on tour and
placed under the sensible watch of the
‘Sulphate Strangler’. Dury’s relation-
ship with his father (Ray Winstone)
is also cleverly incorporated into film
and adds yet another layer of depth to
the complex emotional input of Dury
who fables his respect for his father
in the eternal ‘My Old Man’. There is
also a touching and thought-provoking
side-story into Dury’s contribution to
the United Nations year of the disabled
with his infamous song ‘spasticus au-
tisticus’ that is pivotal to understand-
ing Dury and is excellently embedded
into narrative by Whitecross.
Do you need to be fan of Dury or The
Blockheads to enjoy this?
Absolutely not, it is an absorbing,
exciting and subtle tear jerker of a film
that provides a wonderful insight into
the life of one of the most unique in-
dividuals to emerge in the late 70s, ir-
respective of whether you love, hate or
know nothing of Dury, it is a dynamic,
human and buoyant film with an un-
precedented kaleidoscope of energy in
its protagonist that makes for highly
charged viewing. In a final swansong
Whitecross allows Dury to hit every
viewer with his rhythm stick once
more.

Nine
Among the never-ending stream of
modern musical films, there were some
hits, (Moulin Rouge, Hairspray) com-
plete critical/financial flops (2009’s
Fame and Rent) and those in between
(Evita, The Phantom of the Opera). But
before you say “Oh no, not another
flashy, camp, musical film”, Nine turns
into a complex character study of one
complicated film director.
Nine is based on an Italian master-
piece 8 ½ directed by Federico Fellini,
which incidentally is based on Fellini
himself. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Guido
Contini, a troubled but once talented
film director who is failing to write a
single word for his script even when
the costumes are being made, the sets
are being built, and the film is sup-
posed to be shot in ten days. His writ-
er’s block is worsened by the compli-
cated relationships he shares with the
various women in his life. Day-Lewis’
Contini is not Marcello Mastroianni’s
Guido in 8 ½ but is a more confused,
burnt-out, and most importantly, is an
original character that does not try to
mimic the old version in any way.
To be honest, who wouldn’t be
slightly distracted in his situa-
tion? He’s surrounded by beauti-
ful women; his wife Luisa (Marion
Cotillard), his seductive mistress
Carla (Penélope Cruz), his
muse Claudia (Nicole
Kidman), his confi-
dante Lilane (Judi
Dench), Stephanie
(Kate Hudson) a
stunning reporter
who wants to have a
good lay with Con-
tini more than any-
thing else, memo-
ries of his Mamma
(Sophia Loren), and
a prostitute from his
childhood, Saraghina
(Stacey ‘Fergie’ Fergu-
son) who taught him
the art of love-making.
All of these characters
are introduced in a
spectacular opening
sequence where the
women’s relation-
ships with Guido are
briefly explained.
Reading the long
list of fabulous actors
can build up unwant-
ed hype and expecta-
tions. We all know they
can act full stop. Just
between the eight of
them they share seven
Oscar wins and eleven
further nominations.
Cotillard gives a quiet
but intense perform-
ance as the victim of Contini’s nu-
merous affairs, her intense rendition
of “Take it All” making the audience
truly sympathise with the situation this
woman is in, Cruz is overflowing with
sex appeal, more so when she’s twist-
ing and wrapping her body around
ropes and curtains, Kidman blesses the
screen with her angelic, beautiful pres-
ence etc... But the important factor is
to remember that this is a musical and
to ask the crucial question of whether
they can sing. Well, of course they can.
The casting of Day-Lewis was con-
sidered to be an odd one when first
announced. No-one knew whether he
could sing or not, and no-one really
knew whether he could be convinc-
ing as an Italian. But once again, he
doesn’t disappoint and his perform-
ance is faultless. He surprises all of us
when he proves that his singing is just
as powerful and effective as his acting.
He only sings a couple of songs, but
they’re unforgettable ones. His scruffy
appearance reflects his chaotic lifestyle
and it’s not surprising that he’s strug-
gling to write a script.
Hudson, although stuck with a char-
acter who doesn’t end up being too cru-
cial, is given her moment to shine with
probably one of the best and memora-
ble songs in the film, “Cinema Italiano.”
She sings and dances her heart out, as
do the backing singers/dancers. The
music is immediately catchy, as is the
electrifying choreography that Hudson
handles perfectly.
A special round of applause however,
must go to Ferguson, who argua-
bly delivers the best musical
number in the film. For
those who have seen
the trailers, the song
“Be Italian” will be quite
familiar. But just wait
until you see
the big pic-
ture, when
the big
screen
and
sound
systems
capture
Fergu-
son’s bold,
steady
voice as well
as the sexy,
dangerous and
captivating visu-
als. The song
covers two very
different time-
lines and styles.
There’s Contini’s
intimate black-
and-white flash-
back of Saraghi-
na teaching the
ever-so enthu-
siastic boys about
sex, and then
there’s the more
passion-
ate,
full-coloured (very effectively in red
and black) scene of Saraghina, various
other women, sand and tambourines.
What’s more impressive is Fergie’s per-
fect transformation into her character.
She gained something like eight kilos
and with her push-up dress, messy hair
and glaring eyes, she looks exactly like
someone who successfully sells sex for
a living, promising to fulfill all the hid-
den male fantasies.
Due to the large cast, some actresses
aren’t given enough deserving focus.
Loren, Dench and Kidman are all mar-
vellous singers but are all underused.
Giving each and every one of them
the full attention would probably have
brought the running time right up to
the three-hour mark and could have
been overly tedious. But it’s just not
that easy to forget all about the three
fabulous actresses after their stunning
but brief appearances.
Nine is a sophisticated, dazzling,
savvy musical. Rob Marshall delivers a
more stylish, focused film than his pre-
vious musical effort Chicago. There is
a noticeable lack of memorable songs,
and it won’t be easy to hum the songs
again outside the cinema but it’s hard
to care when you can remember the
astonishing choreog-
raphy and faultless
performances in a
heart-beat.
