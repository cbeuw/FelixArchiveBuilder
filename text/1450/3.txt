Political heavyweights visit Imperial
T
he last week has seen a
flurry of big political hon-
chos visiting our South
Kensington Campus.
Boris Johnson, the
floppy haired Mayor of London, has
officially opened the £160 million
project of revitalizing Prince’s Gar-
dens which was initiated in 2002 and
finally concluded this September with
the completion of Eastside, ready to
welcome students for the beginning of
the 2009/2010 academic year. Imperial
has owned the site since 1956. The site
is now comprised of nine halls of resi-
dence, a state-of-the-art sports centre,
a shop and a brand new restaurant/bar
that is highly popular with both stu-
dents and staff.
Having arrived by bicycle, the Mayor
looked around the site and spoke to
students living in its newest hall, East-
side. Mr Johnson was also cooked food
for by some of the students there, be-
Imperial is increasingly the go to place for leaders from a wide variety of political backgrounds, and as several
visit the South Kensington campus this week, Features Editor Afonso Campos reports
fore moving on to officially open the
residence and the square. Of note in his
speech was the description of Imperial
as “amongst the very finest of universi-
ties”, adding that he also wanted to “see
more Nobel Prize winners cut their
teeth in South Kensington”. Humorous
as always, Mr Johnson exclaimed that
penicillin, invented in London, can be
“very useful after a night out in Praed
Street”.
The new Acting Rector, Sir Keith
O’Nions commented that as an insti-
tution, “We’re all honoured that the
Mayor is joining us to celebrate the
completion of the work”. Ashley Brown
the Union President, added that the
entire area has been “transformed
from a rogue’s gallery of architectural
disasters into a magnificent square”.
The College was also privy to a visit
from Kapil Sibal, India’s relatively new
Minister of Human Resource Devel-
opment. He is Minister of Science
and Technology as well as Minister
of Earth Sciences. The visit comes as
part of a week-long tour of a mission to
further the educational bonds between
the United Kingdom and India. India
is looking at ways in which it is able to
improve its higher education system
and is planning to create institutions
that go by the name of “innovation uni-
versities”. Initially, these will focus on
the prominent issues of health, envi-
ronment and reusable technologies in
the power generation arena. The main
reason for the visit to Imperial College
itself however, was to observe how our
university operates its processes of
transferring technological and scien-
tific research into applications that can
be commercially viable and applicable
to real-world scenarios.
Imperial Innovations is headed by Dr
Martin Knight, is a technology transfer
company owned partly by the univer-
sity and it is based at the South Ken-
sington Campus. It has spawned over
80 companies in the last decade and
was the main focus of Mr Sibal’s visit.
Sir Keith, mentioned that he was “de-
lighted to welcome Mr Sibal to Impe-
rial, and to discuss with him his very
exciting and far-sighted approach to
higher education in India”. He added
that as a university, Imperial has an ob-
ligation to turn “research into tangible
benefits to society”.
While unrelated to Imperial Col-
lege directly, two heavyweights did
spend time on campus last Saturday.
As part of the Fabian Society’s new
year conference, Gordon Brown and
Peter Mandelson delivered what the
media have started describing as the
first “keynote” speech of the new elec-
tion year. Gordon Brown’s speech was
delivered in the morning, in the Great
Hall (Sherfield Building), kicking off a
day of other very high profile speakers,
including Peter Mandelson, the Secre-
tary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills, Ken Livingstone and former
leader of the Liberal Democratic party,
Vince Cable. Mr Brown stated that the
party was “fighting to win”, making full
use of pathos, in what is already con-
sidered a crucial speech that outlined
his party’s strategy of increasing so-
cial mobility - a theme that is due to
become the central issue of the cam-
paign. Given that this was a private
event, merely held at Imperial, felix
was unable to reach any of the speak-
ers for comments.
