MUSIC
Recently gaining a member becoming a
5-piece band, from Hammersmith, this
is impure electric guitar wonder with
pure fight. Their sound is of guitars,
keyboards and cowbells. The songs are
full of unbeatable hooks and intelligent
lyrics, sang by all members in a com-
plex whirlwind of vocal melodies and
harmonies. Tellison make a humble
kind of indie-rock; this is a refreshing
change, and every song on this album
is worthy of being a hit. - Luke Turner
The debut album from this 10-piece
theatrical orchestra is characterised by
sweeping piano and strings arrange-
ments. It could potentially be gentle,
soothing background music if the singer
didn’t fluctuate between a low Antony
Hegarty-type voice and piercing falset-
to. The vocals are definitely an acquired
taste and the band are at their best on
songs where their erratic and creative
use of orchestral sounds isn’t overshad-
owed by the vocals. - Tom Jennings

Whatever happened to Usher? Did he
ever come out as gay or was that just a
rumor? Honestly, if a really openly gay
and camp rapper came out they would
have that whole untapped market cor-
nered. Anyway, this song is pretty un-
exciting. As with all rap/R&B, the lyr-
ics are the best bit. “Simply I glaze they
ass/Just like some churches biscuits/
Beat her like she stole my Bentley/
Swagger jackers pay attention.”
- Alex Ashford
Ben Rayner recorded this “diss” song
about Sonic Youth at ATP festival. It’s
also the name of his zine. Cranking ap-
parently means crying and wanking at
the same time. If you didn’t know that,
you can add it to your subgenres of
wanking along with shanking (wank-
ing in the shower) and danger wanking
(wanking in a situation where you are
likely to get caught). This song is kind
of a joke, and for a joke, it’s a kind of an
okay song. - Alex Ashford
Charged with anger and grit, this al-
bum is for trudging through rain and
mud, it will induce ferocity. It shows
glimmers of great rock at the beginning
to most tracks which then sinks away
into a thundering, quite unimaginative,
wall of distortion. It’s an album of two
parts, one being considerably more
self-indulgent than the other. This mu-
sic would be absolute heaven to play at
full volume, but not half as fun to listen
to I’m afraid. - Luke Turner

A flash of fluttering voices and 80’s
style groove. The sound is catchy with
warm electrical vibrations, weaved per-
fectly with psychedelic vocal melodies
and phrases, restoring my faith that all
electro music isn’t shit. The odd song
turning easy-listening quite repetitive
but magically saved by the occasional
brass flare and disco vibe that keeps the
album diverse. Using clever manipula-
tion of a sweet voice gives this album a
genuinely different feel. - Luke Turner

So as predicted, Radiohead are

want to know who is responsible
for this because with no disrespect
to the wonder of Radiohead, after
topping almost every ‘Albums of
the Decade’ chart, they have had
the glory they deserve. Branch out
Imperial... Branch out.
