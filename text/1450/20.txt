Pigs might fly as UK
Pirate found innocent
UK’s first piracy verdict boosts moral of the bruised and battered
Torrent crowd as Alan Ellis trots free

f you looked at the technology
press this week you could be for-
given in thinking that Apple had
unleashed some new revolu-
tionary products. The thing is, Apple
hasn’t done anything this week apart
from send out invitations to a press
event to be held in San Francisco on
January 27th. OK, when Apple holds
a press event they normally unveil
something, but the way that the news
is saturated you’d think they were go-
ing to announce something that’ll end
world hunger, eradicate terrorism,
bring world peace and all with a sleek
white finish.
So an Apple event on the 27th. It’s
got the tag line ‘Come see our Latest
Creation’; if that doesn’t scream Ap-
ple tablet I don’t know what does. The
curious thing about this event however
has to be the inclusion of a select few
members of the gaming press on the
invitation list. Getting an invite out
of Apple to one of its press events is
like owning your own plane, it’s sim-
ply not going to happen unless you’re
really, really important. But to invite
some games press indicates that Apple
thinks something it’s going to unveil at
this event is going to appeal to them.
OK, if you’ve ever seen an Apple ad
you’ll have heard the ‘iPod touch is the
best gaming device’ rubbish they try
and ram down your throat. The App
Store has a lot of games in it and be-
cause they’re relatively cheap, they’ve
done well, but there’s no way the iPod
touch or the iPhone is as good an ex-

n the first major piracy verdict
since the landmark Pirate Bay
case, the owner and founder
of the music sharing website
‘OiNK’s Pink Palace’ was de-
clared not guilty by an unanimous jury
at the Teesside Crown Court. The case
is also notable because it’s the first
music piracy trial that has delivered a
verdict within the UK. While the case
does not set a judicial precedent for fu-
ture cases, it was a remarkable victory
for Alan Ellis, who founded the sharing
service during his studies at the Uni-
versity of Teesside.
His arrest in 2007 was highly dra-
matic, with police inviting TV cameras
to watch as they carried out a dawn
raid on Ellis’ house, as Dutch police
simultaneously raided his servers in
the Netherlands. While Ellis’ opera-
tions were much smaller than those of
The Pirate Bay (with his case attracting
much less attention), the invite-only
website had developed a reputation
for listing high quality recordings a
long time before they were released.
The website was even endorsed by
Trent Reznor, who described it as “the
world’s greatest record store”.
The prosecution told the jury that
Ellis was found with nearly $300,000 in
his PayPal account and accused him of
“large scale, professional, clever, tech-
nical ripping off”, while Ellis countered
that the money simply came from sur-
plus donations and that it “had to be
stored somewhere”. Ellis was also able
to successfully defend the allegations
of fraud levelled against him by using
a similar argument to the one used by
The Pirate Bay - as a torrent tracker,
his website merely indexed material
uploaded by users and didn’t actually
host any of the illegal files. It’s also clear
that the circumstances around the case
played a large role in the proceedings -
The Pirate Bay was a large organisation
supported by healthy finances, while
OiNK’s Palace was distinctly smaller,
with Alan Ellis making little if any real
money out of running the website.
The verdict has little legal meaning
- it doesn’t set a binding precedent for
all future cases - yet it’s the first major
legal victory for the now beleaguered
torrent community and will probably
serve as a morale booster at a time
when many major torrent trackers are
shutting down or sealing themselves
off from the public. As for Alan Ellis,
while it seems unlikely that ‘OiNK’s
Pink Palace’ is going to be restored
to its former glory, he should be able
to wash his hands of the affair in the
knowledge that the case isn’t appeal-
able and he has emerged virtually un-
scathed from the experience.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Wow, what a week in tech. Ac-
tually to tell you the truth, it’s
all more or less been rumour
about Apple’s flaming tablet.
Thankfully a few other things
happened this week, so let’s get
stuck in eh?
First up we’ve got a man
killed by Avatar. Yes Cam-
eron’s 3D, supersmurf epic,
not only shattered box of-
fice revenue but can also
kill you. A 42-year-
old Taiwanese
cinema goer suf-
fered a stroke
likely brought
on by ‘over-ex-
citement’ trig-
gered by the film.
Remember kids,
it’s not real OK?
More ridiculousness
in the form of ‘TwittaBling’ this
week. Apparently someone
thought it was a good idea to
get their Twitter name embla-
zoned on a medallion and wear
it out in public. If that’s not bad
enough you can even get wed-
ding bands with your Twit-
ter handles engraved on the
inside. Wow. I admittedly use
Twitter quite a lot but come
on, seriously? That’s just sad.
Ever thought what a 7.5m
disco ball would look like? Well
take a trip to Paris and you can
see one hanging some 50m
above the ground spar-
kling under spotlight.
The massive disco
ball consists of 1000
mirrors and is part
of a contempo-
rary art exhibition
called Nuit Blanche
above the Jardin du
Luxembourg.
More weird and won-
derful news, this time from
Britain. According to a recent
presentation by ComScore,
Britain’s most downloaded
iPhone app is iPint. Yes,
Britain shows
their love of
booze by
down-
loading
a pint
simulation in
their millions.
If you don’t know what iPint
does, find someone with an
iPhone. Chances are they’ll
have it.
More Apple related strange-
ness this week and no, not
even about the iTablet. Appar-
ently 20% of people surveyed
by Lewis PR in the UK when
asked who Steve Jobs was, the
enigmatic CEO of Apple, Inc.,
thought he was a footballer.
Now, I’m sure you’ve all seen
the ‘Stupid American’ YouTube
videos where they go an sur-
vey the dumbest people on
the planet, but this just goes
to show that even Brits can be
morons. A footballer? I could
forgive them for thinking he
was a politician or a BBC exec,
but not the nation’s favourite
past-time.
Talking of Steve Jobs, not
everyone gets everything right
and even he can be at fault.
A shocking revelation came
out this week about the name
that Jobs would have given
the iMac line if they’d let him:
the Macman. Dodged a bullet
there Steve.
Google has been in the
news a lot this week one way
or another. Something you
might have missed however is
that the next iteration of the
Android operating system is
going to be called ‘FroYo’. Yes
that’s right, Frozen Yoghurt.
Someone at Google obviously
has a food obsession; first we
had ‘cupcake’, then ‘donut’,
with 2.0 called ‘eclair’. Perhaps
someone’s New Year’s resolu-
tion was to eat healthier, FroYo
indeed.
Sony got in on the post-CES
news this week with its new
high-end ‘only the best will do’
Vaio Z series. Pack-
ing an Intel Core
i7, 6GB RAM, an
Nvidia GT330M
GPU in parallel
with integrated
Intel HD graph-
ics, along
with a Full
HD LED backlit display into
a svelte 1.4Kg 13.3” frame,
the Vaio Z is a PC users wet
dream. A finger print reader,
webcam, Bluetooth 2.1 and 3G
modem also come along for
the ride, making this machine
spec wise, one of the best lap-
tops ever made. It’ll launch
in March with pricing unan-
nounced, but be sure you’ll
have to sell a kidney to afford
one of these bad boys. A trade
worth making perhaps.
In other news Microsoft
is urging XP
and IE6 users
to upgrade
pronoto fol-
lowing the
Google hack-
ing that’s re-
cently taken the
headlines.
Mozilla also un-
leashed Firefox 3.6
RC2 this week prep-
ping for a final release some-
time in the next week or two.
The Winter Olympics is
coming to Freesat from the
12th February in HD. This
joins the World Cup, Six Na-
tions, Golf Masters, Wimble-
don and a boat load of Europe-
an football broadcast in HD. A
good time to be a Freesat user.

perience as a proper games console,
portable or not. Now, that fabled Ap-
ple tablet might come with a bit more
oomph in the processing department,
maybe even fully fledged graphics, but
unless it’s got more buttons, some sort
of expansion controller, it’s not going
to be any better a gaming experience
than the iPod touch. At this stage Ap-
ple could be pulling a fast one on us
with all this tablet nonsense and is ac-
tually prepping an Apple TV replace-
ment games console. Until Steve pulls
one out on the 27th we really don’t
know, anything could happen.
Another interesting yet mysterious
take away from the event announce-
ment is that there’s no European re-
peat. Normally when Apple has had an
announcement in the US they’ve piped
the video into a venue in London in re-
al-time. So what does that tell us? Well
it could mean that whatever they have
for us is going to be US-only, at least in
the short term. It would be extremely
disappointing, but that’s the same tac-
tic they took with the original release
of the iPhone.
Speaking of iPhone, there are also
rumours we’re going to see iPhone
4.0 software at the event. Speculated
highlights include multi-tasking, sys-
tem wide multi-touch gestures (maybe
even on the back for a June/July iPhone
4G revision), new syncing possibilities
and UI changes. Could this be the end
for the need to jailbreak for most users
not seeking an unlock? Check out next
week’s coverage for all the information.
