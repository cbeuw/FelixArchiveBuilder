McMahon and Kwan beating Billy
Moss 5–2. This success was repeated
in the second match against Bristol
3 with Victor’s 5–1 win against Do-
minic Knight and Kwan’s 5–3 win over
Eoghan Beamish. With such swift vic-
tories, Imperial proceeded to play the
group winners match against defend-
ing champions Warwick, unfortunate-
ly losing 2–0 despite Kwan’s 3–2 lead
over Matthew Bradley in the uncom-
pleted final rubber.
Nevertheless, this performance en-
sured Imperial’s spot in the elimina-
tion round of the Team Champion-
ship, played after a further 2–1 loss
against York 2 in the inconsequential
final group match.. Playing for a place
in the quarters, Imperial contested a
nail-biting showdown against Aston
1. Victor lost 5–3 against Pritesh Patel
while Behnam beat Frank Deng 5–3.
This meant that it all rested on the
shoulders of Kwan. In a match watched
by dozens, he and Aston’s Amish Pa-
tel were on the hill at 4–4, with Kwan
requiring just one more foul to exer-
cise the rare three consecutive foul
rule, which would force the opponent
into conceding the rack and hence the
match. Unfortunately, this was not to
be and Imperial suffered a 5–4 defeat
to bow out of the competition.
Although disappointed as our team
had a real shot at medals this year, we
did improve upon last year’s perform-
ance, and we will endeavour to put in
more practice to bring back medals
from the BUCS-UPC Eight-ball Pool
Championships in February. Team tri-
als for this will take place on Wednes-
day 27 January and everyone is wel-
come! Just contact snooker@ic.ac.uk

On Tuesday this week David Attoub,
a prop forward for the flamboyant Pa-
risian team Stade Francais, was given
a 70-week ban for eye gouging, while
team mate Julien Dupuy was banned
for 23 weeks for the same offence. The
recipient of both men’s attention was
Ulsterman Stephen Ferris, attacked
during a hotly contested Heineken cup
game in December. Both players de-
nied gouging even in the face of photo-
graphic evidence, having the audacity
to claim the evidence may have been
edited by the Irish photographer. Stade
Francais president, Max Guazzini, has
been more than vocal with his views of
the incident and subsequent bans even
going as far to say that it is ‘anti-French’.
The length of bans had been re-
viewed over the summer after the
abysmal handling of similar gouging
incidents involving Sergio Parisse and
Schalk Burger where both men were
sentenced to just an 8 week ban each.
Gouging is seen to be the most damag-
ing action for the reputation of rugby;
use of performance enhancing drugs is
very rare, aside from a few isolated in-
cidents. Professional rugby players are
perceived to be elegant, unspoilt men,
unlike their football counterparts.
However parents will understandably
be reluctant to allow their children to
play a sport which gouging is a part
of. As a result the International Rugby
Board felt it necessary to clamp down
on offenders, although why it has taken
quite so long remains a mystery. Goug-
ing is a cowardly and unsportsmanlike
act and has no place in the game and in
addition the pros surely outweigh the
cons for performing a gouge on an op-
ponent; there is no obvious advantage
gained from gouging and if seen by the
referee a yellow or more appropriately
a red card will be brandished almost
certainly damaging the offender’s
chances of securing victory. Further-
more, television evidence can be used
to find offenders once the
game has finished.
The implementation of lengthy bans
coupled with better than ever video
equipment is seen to be the great-
est deterrent to those who do gouge
their opponents. Only time will tell if
it works.
Ultimately the reputation of rugby
and the players are the ones who suf-
fer as a consequence of this underhand
action: Dupuy would have been named
in Marc Lievremont’s French squad for
the six nations, announced yesterday.
However in his absence others will
now be able to showcase their talents;
Dupuy may rue the decision but can
blame no one but himself.
Alternatively, Schalk Burger, the
Springbok flanker, grappled with Luke
Fitzgerald’s eye socket within the first
30 seconds of the second Lions test this
summer. Although the assistant ref-
eree witnessed the event, Burger was
inexplicably given just 10 minutes in
the sin bin instead of being dismissed
from the field of play. Had Burger
been correctly sent off, the Springboks
would probably not have won the sec-
ond test and the lions tour that nearly
was could have ended up with a differ-
ent outcome. After the second test, the
South African coach Peter de Villiers
incredulously defended his player’s
actions much to astonishment of the
rugby world.
Attoub’s ban is the second longest to
be given out for the offence since the
game turned professional, the length
is greater than that of Dupuy’s due to
previous records of ill discipline and
the fact Attoub pleaded not guilty to
the citing charges. The ban runs until
wwwApril 2011 and with the game of
rugby continuing to evolve at such a
rate, a yearlong ban could be too long
for a player to come back to playing at
the top level.
The authorities have recognised that
action must be taken and have begun
to put in place the measurements to
keep the rugby game clean and pre-
serve the gentleman’s game. The trag-
edy is that they shouldn’t have to.

the Reading goalkeeper.
Reading gradually regained pos-
session and after a few lukewarm op-
portunities, they restored their 3-goal
advantage in a manner similar to that
of the first goal. Imperial were again
caught out in the middle and the Read-
ing striker worked well to drag the cen-
tre backs out of their position to and
was rewarded with a well-taken finish.
Imperial didn’t give up and again cre-
ated some chances with dynamic play
from Matthieu Vallin and Nathan Fer-
rol, to no avail.
Reading completed their scoring
with another counter attack, taking
advantage of the fatigue of the outfield
players and us the wings to stretch
Imperial and then deliver a low cross
which was met by the Reading striker.
The game was played out and the
game ended 5-1 to the favourites. Cup
matches often yield surprises but un-
fortunately it wasn’t to be for Imperial
who were against a team who scored 5
of the 6 chances they created. If Impe-
rial are to rise up a notch and secure
promotion into Reading’s league, the
discipline and concentration will need
to improve over the 90 minutes, as will
clinical ability of all members of the
team.
A surprise did occur on the adja-
cent pitch in another 3rd round BUCS
cup tie between Imperial’s 2nd XI and
LSE’s 3rd XI. Questions were raised af-
ter a number of LSE players emerged
on the pitch with ‘1st/2nd team’ em-
blazoned on their tracksuits. Imperial
went on to lose 2-1 and diminished the
hopes of Imperial being represented in
the last 16 of the cup.
The 1st XI nevertheless move on, and
concentrate on aiming for promotion
in the BUCS league and aiming for the
final in the ULU Challenge Cup, with a
promising quarter final against an as-
yet-unbeaten SOAS side tomorrow.
