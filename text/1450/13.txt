Man imprisoned for delivering letter
A 29 year old American-Korean
crossed the border from China into
North Korea on Christmas Day, enter-
ing one of the most closed and oppres-
sive societies on Earth, and prepared
for the worst.
Crossing the frozen Tumen river on
foot, Robert Park of the group Free-
dom and Life for All North Koreans,
was armed only with a letter addressed
to the country’s president Kim Jong-il
calling for the Premier to ‘open your
borders so that we may bring food,
provisions, medicine, necessities, and
assistance to those who are struggling
to survive.’
North Korea has, according to Am-
nesty International, one of the worst
human rights records in history. As
many as one million North Koreans
languish in its prisons, enduring forced
labour, starvation and torture.
This is a fate which likely awaits the
US citizen who was arrested on cross-
ing the border; the maximum sentence
for which is 3 years – assuming he isn’t
laden with any other charges (the very
fact that he is Christian is a crime in
North Korea).
Park himself is unconcerned, saying
that he is prepared to be a martyr for
his cause and insisting that he is not
looking for the Obama administration
to step in, as they did when two Ameri-
can journalists were imprisoned there
last year.
Knowing that he could easily have
been shot on his crossing, Park’s aim is
nonetheless to raise awareness for the

Political parties want to make drinking more expensive
Over the coming months the regula-
tions regarding the sale & taxation of
alcohol is set to change, to curb the ris-
ing drink-related illness & crime rates.
Over 40,000 people every year die
with a drink-related illness, and the
annual costs associated with drink-
related crime & disorder are between
£8bn and £13bn.
Labour are proposing a ban on or-
ganised ‘all you can drink’ nights and
drinking games in pubs – bad news
for the Union – and tougher measures
to ensure alcohol isn’t sold or served
to under-18s.
About the ban on such promotions,
Alan Johnson, Home Secretary, said
“These practices have a real impact
on society, not to mention the lives of
those who just want to enjoy a good
night out.”
Tory proposals include a levy on
premises selling alcohol after a certain
time and an increase in alcohol duty.
More bad news for the Union...
A minimum price per unit of alco-
hol is being called for by the Liberal
Democrats – could this spell the end
of Cheapskates?!?
Liberal Democrat Home Affairs
spokesman Chris Huhne said “Boozy
Britain is ruining lives and costing the
country billions, but Labour has not
only failed to tackle alcohol misuse,
it has allowed an epidemic of drink-
fuelled crime and illness to take hold.
Now the government is ignoring its
own expensive advice and experts,
who say the best way to reduce alco-
hol misuse is to stop booze being sold
at pocket money prices.”
This is after the publication of a
report earlier this month which con-
cluded that setting a 50p minimum
price per unit would save 3000 lives
per year.
What! You can still buy a unit for
under 50p? Show me where!
With an election looming, and the
NHS, crime and public spending high
on the agenda as always, expect to see
some of these measures soon.

Any move to increase the cost of alcohol will hit students hard, but will increasing the price really solve any problems?

says ‘7,000,000 people are starving to

many millions have starved under Kim

The timing of his move can only be
especially displeasing to the Pyongyang
government, as the country enters a
new stage of dialogue with the US over

It is essential that the reality of the
North Korean state be recognised and
with this one man drawing unwelcome
attention to the gravest crimes com-
mitted by the Stalinist state, his fate is
not expected to be a promising one.
