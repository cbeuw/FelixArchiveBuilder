felix FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010
I
am a stranger in a strange land.
As much I adore this sprawling
metropolis, the inkblot on the
cosmic sketchbook that is Lon-
don, I know in my heart that it’s
not home. You see, I’m not from round
these parts. I’m not even English – not
that should shock one the most multi-
cultural student bodies in the country.
If you have been at all confused by my
somewhat uncommon nomenclature,
I can assure you it is peculiar to my
home country. I come from that be-
loved corner of Britain where the grass
is greener and the rain is wetter. Wales.
That old land of my fathers, where
there are more sheep than vowels and
where people communicate across
the valleys with scores of male voice
choirs, is where I call home.
Here’s a joke for you:
What do you call a sheep tied to a
lamppost in the middle of Cardiff? A
leisure centre. Haha.
As devastatingly funny as that para-
gon of humour was, it is not an accu-
rate depiction of my country. And yet
this is what people think of when I tell
them I’m from Wales, which is a shame
of the highest calibre. Wales is such a
lovely country, rich in culture and his-
tory; at least, that’s what I think but,
hey, maybe I’m biased. Anyway, con-
sider this a whistle-stop tour of the real
green and pleasant land.
First off, the sheep. Yes, we do have
a lot of them. In fact, they outnumber
the people four to one, which is why I
hope and pray they never revolt. We
would be screwed! Keeping the sheep
peaceful is one reason why we don’t
shag them. The other reason is because
it’s weird, and not the least bit icky.
Next, castles. Wales has lots of cas-
tles. If you don’t have a castle, you’re
nothing. The reason we have so many
is because they’re useful things to have
when you find yourself being invaded.
And people like invading Wales; Ro-
mans, Irish, Vikings, French (though
we beat them) and it’s like a hobby
for the English or something. If you’re
ever in Wales, try and find your nearest
castell, I promise it won’t be far. I once
found one on a golf course.
By the way, castell isn’t a misspell-
ing, it’s Welsh. Yes, Wales has its own
language. It’s what everyone used to
speak before the English invaded (I
can’t remember which time) but now,
sadly, it’s the reserve of the Gogled-
dwrau (the people of North Wales) and
those know-it-alls who paid attention
in GCSE Welsh. But I digress. Welsh is
a lovely, musical language, filled with
grammatical tomfoolery. For a start,
we have more vowels than English,
because we’re bohemian libertines like
that. There’s also a few double-letters
like ll, ch, ff, in case we need sounds
that English people can’t pronounce
(and not for lack of trying. I spent a
year training a captive Englishman,
nothing).
Onto the two big Rs: rugby and re-
ligion. In Wales, these are one and
the same. Though he may be accused
of being ignorant in many things, a
Welshman knows his way around
three things; a bible, a rugby ball...and
a sheep, of course. These two facets are
so intimately intertwined, so deeply
ingrained in the Welsh identity that
the well-known revival hymn Bread of
Heaven often echoes round the Millen-
nium Stadium during the pitched bat-
tles of the Six Nations. Indeed, the pas-
sion behind that anthem far outstrips
the paltry quaverings of Jerusalem.
A word on the geography. There’s
South Wales, where all the shiny, in-
teresting and downright useful stuff,
like Doctor Who and my house, for
example, may be found. Then there’s
West Wales. There are caravans here,
and puffins, and holiday-homes for
people in Surrey to visit on the week-
end. Then there’s Mid Wales, which
is full of mountains. I’m not sure what
else is there...it’s quite a “here be drag-
ons” place. And those are real dragons.
Lastly, there’s North Wales. It’s like
another country, completely alien in
every way. They speak Welsh there...
properly, I mean, not just as an easy
way to chat up women. The only thing
I can tell you for certain is that they
hate South Wales with the passion of
a thousand suns. I don’t why...it’s prob-
ably because we’re better.
The Welsh are a completely down-
trodden yet eternally optimistic peo-
ple. We’re the underdog of the British...
and everyone loves an underdog.
Hywl Fawr!
C
an’t I put it off for a few
hours longer?
No, I’ve wasted enough
time already. Right – time
to sit down and finally
batter out this week’s comment piece.
Maybe I should just clean the living
room again? Some more dust may have
accumulated under the sofa in the two
minutes since I put the vacuum clean-
er away... Maybe putting the vacuum
cleaner away caused more dust to ac-
cumulate under the sofa? I’d better go
and check...
No – I should sit and write.
Maybe just polish the computer
screen one last time...
No, No and No. Get a grip on your-
self, turn on the computer, mute the
sound, and open Microsoft Word.
Right. I’ve opened a new blank docu-
ment and it just looks so pretty. So
clean and white – it’s almost a shame
to spoil it by writing anything on it.
Anything short of perfection, that is.
So the first line must leap out of the
starting blocks like Usain Bolt being
tasered. It should welcome and arouse
with the elegance and charm of Lauren
Bacall putting her lips together and
blowing. The page should vibrate to
the pulsating rhythm of the very first
Flaubertian mots justes.
“There is a fine distinction between
the artistic and the artisanal.”
Hm. That might work. At least it’s
not actually grammatically incorrect.
Still, there’s no point in getting this
worked up over the first sentence, or
I’ll never get around to writing the sec-
ond one. That’s what happened to the
last few novels I tried to write. Ok, let’s
move on.
Ctrl+S.
Oh – I need to give the document a
name. “Art and artifice.” Nope. “Flow-
ing through our Arteries.” Hm. Maybe
I’m better off simply calling it “Term
2: Comment II”. That’ll do for the mo-
ment. I’ll just write that out at the top
of the document and then I can move
on. There. Doesn’t that look pretty?
OK, where was I.
Hold on – shouldn’t the title be cen-
tralised? Give me a moment, I’ll be
right back. There we go. Maybe ital-
ics... and bold font? No, definitely not
– far too crass. How about a subtle un-
derline? Much better.
Great. Back to the text.
How about changing the font?
Stop it! I can change the font later.
Once I’ve actually written something...
So:
“There is a fine distinction between
the artistic and the artisanal.”
Maybe that should be:
“There is a fine line separating the
artistic and the artisanal.”
Aha! I know:
“The line separating the artistic and
the artisanal could be drawn with a 7H
pencil.” Or doesn’t that quite work?
Never mind, never mind! Keep moving
forward, that’s the key.
Ctrl+S.
Do I really want to say ‘separating’?
How about ‘dividing’? I wonder what
thesaurus.com has to say about it.
Might as well open a new browser,
wait for thesaurus.com to load... Oh
look! A new e-mail in my google ac-
count. Well, a new e-mail in my spam
folder, at any rate. Make that 374 new
e-mails in my spam folder. I wonder
what procedure my account uses to
separate (or should that be divide?)
between spam and genuine e-mails?
Surely there can’t be an algorithm that
faultlessly makes the distinction every
time? I mean, I have been expecting
that e-mail from the BBC people... It
surely wouldn’t hurt to have a quick
look.
Hm. No e-mails from the BBC here...
Just a lot of people looking to sell me
v1agra. Or viazqa. Or xiagra or even
vpagja – whatever that might be.
Oh good – thesaurus.com is fully
loaded. ‘Splitting’ isn’t bad... but ‘be-
tween’ is so much better! Right:
“The line between the artist and
the artisan could be drawn with a
7H pencil. The former devises con-
cepts, whereas the latter sets up
constructions...”
No – ‘sets up’ is no good. ‘Builds’?
‘Constructs’? Too clumsy with
‘constructions’.
I know – ‘erects’! Why didn’t I think
of it before...
“The line between the artist and
the artisan could be drawn with a 7H
pencil. The former devises concepts,
whereas the latter erects constructions
distinguished more by technical ability
than artistic merit.”
Ooh - I’ve got a new facebook mes-
sage... ‘Someone has beaten your score
in Elementz – would you like to play
again and show them what you’re made
of?’ ... Don’t be silly, I’ve got a comment
piece to finish writing.
I’m not sure I like writing it in Mi-
crosoft Word – too many formatting
options are a big distraction. I should
just start a new google document and
write it there.
Ctrl-C. New browser... Opening
google docs.
Ctrl-V. Right. Fresh start. Good,
good. I’ve definitely made the right
choice – Verdana is a far more attrac-
tive font than stuffy old Times New
Roman. Now where was I...
“...West Wales.
There are caravans
here, and puffins,
and holiday-homes
for people in
Surrey to visit on
the weekend.”
