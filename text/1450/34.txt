Overheard at Imperial
Heard something around College that has made you want to die
inside? Submit it to the ‘Overheard at Imperial’ Facebook group
Thanks to Adam Gill and Esther Kang
1. “A drunk chemist (is there any other kind?) staggering home but stopping long
enough to inform the policemen standing next to their car that the Thames Valley
slogan ‘Reducing Crime, Disorder and Fear’ was wrong because it contradicts the
Second Law of Thermodynamics. Apparently they tried to arrest him...”
2. 4 undergrads sitting at a table in the library revising hard for a Maths exam,
one says “I should have just gone to UCL”.
3. Guy at Huxley building: “A Life? Cool! Where can I download one of those?”
4. Girl talking to fellow biologist in Sherfield: “Shit man, I though tigers were
female lions.”
SHIT ONE OF THE WEEK
Me to Chris: Are you serious???
Chris to me: No...I’m parallel!
