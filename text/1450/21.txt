Google’s done with China’s censorship
G
oogle and China have nev-
er really been the best of
friends, and now finally it’s
all over. Following security
breaches of Google servers by hackers
thought to originate from China, last
week Google announced that it would
be removing censorship from all of its
Chinese services. Although the future
is still uncertain, it’s extremely likely
that we’ll see the end of Google.cn and
the company effectively exiled from
the country. As is usual, Google claims
the moral high ground and reinforces
its “don’t be evil” attitude, but other ev-
idence suggests that Google may have
another hidden agenda.
In mid-December, attackers were
able to gain access to two Gmail ac-
counts of Chinese human rights activ-
ists by using a previously undocument-
ed flaw with Internet Explorer. Actual
correspondence was not obtained,
but the hackers were still able to get
information on basic account details,
including the subject lines of emails.
Dmitri Alperovitch from computer
security firm McAfee claimed that
this was the most sophisticated hack-
ing attack on a commercial company
that he has ever been seen. The cor-
porate servers of Adobe and at least 33
other companies were also targeted in
the ‘highly coordinated’ attack, which
Google says originated from China.
The level of sophistication entailed
leads many to suggest that the hackers
were agents of, if not directly employed
by, the Chinese government.
Google’s local presence in China
began in 2006 when the company
launched Google.cn, which is to China
what Google.co.uk is for us. Although
the company was obviously very posi-
tive to be doing business in the country,
the move attracted massive criticism
after it was revealed that search results
were being actively censored according
to rules from the Chinese government.
This included websites critical of the
Communist regime and news and
images from particular events, most
famously the Tiananmen Square pro-
tests. At the time co-founder Sergey
Brin still tried to emphasise that they
were doing the right thing. Part of the
agreement was that Google could tell
users that their searches were being
filtered and by doing so, Brin claimed,
it would let Chinese citizens know that
their government was trying to hide
information.
Things continued in this way until
2009 when the Chinese authorities
began to tighten their grip on inter-
net access in the country. Along with
the demand for all home PCs to run
‘Green Dam’, government censorship
software masquerading as a parental
control filter, the China Illegal Infor-
mation Reporting Centre demanded
that Google block several overseas
websites of which many were sexual
in nature. Then, in December, hackers
infiltrated Google and tried to gain ac-
cess to the Gmail accounts of Chinese
human rights activists.
Following the incident, and in con-
junction with what they call ‘attempts
over the past year to further limit
free speech,’ on 12th January Google
signalled the end to its censorship in
China, even if it meant ‘having to shut
down Google.cn’ and their Chinese of-
fices. This does however seem a little
suspicious, especially considering that
some top security analysts have called
the attack ‘routine’ despite its level of
sophistication. Mikko Hypponen of
security firm F-Secure said, ‘this wasn’t
in my opinion ground-breaking as an
attack. We see this fairly regularly.’
Given also that Google has so far made
no claim to be ending its compliance
with US laws which limit freedom of
speech, such as those which made it
remove sites critical of scientology in
2002, it’s easy to wonder if censorship
really is the only item pushing Google’s
agenda. After all, if such attacks are in-
deed ‘routine,’ then why has this par-
ticular incident made the company do
such an abrupt U-turn on its censor-
ship policy?
Clearly, a company as big as Google
does not act on impulse when pull-
ing out of a market as large and with
as much potential as China. The evi-
Simon Worthington takes a look at the story that has the technology press going crazy over censorship
number one visited website (which in-
terestingly enough Google used to own
a share in prior to setting up their own
service). According to Alexa, while
Baidu sits in the top spot Google ranks
a paltry third, for once failing to domi-
nate the search market. Given this rela-
tively poor performance for the search
engine giant it wouldn’t be surprising
if quitting China has been on the cards
for quite a while. Google does stand
to lose $600 million annually from the
move, but that is a tiny sum compared
to their global revenue of $22 billion.
What’s more likely is that Google
have decided their “don’t be evil” im-
age is worth more than the money they
stand to lose. Indeed, although their
stock price took a tumble after the an-
nouncement just days later it was back
to its original position as if nothing
had happened. In 2006 many called
for a boycott on the search engine and
said that the company had betrayed its
ideals. Google will be hoping that this
move will restore its position in the
public eye as a ‘nice’ company and win
it some favourable publicity which will
have much more financial benefit in
the West. This move also puts pressure
on rivals Microsoft and Yahoo who
continue to operate under censorship
and have much more to lose from quit-
ting the Chinese market altogether.
Although Google’s decision does
send a strong message about censor-
ship and freedom of speech, it cannot
be denied that Google has a lot to gain
personally from it. Taken at face value,
this decision certainly will cost Google
money up front. But in the long term
their reputation of being a ‘nice’ and
‘good’ company may serve them better
and help them to succeed in the mar-
kets they currently do not dominate,
such as their ever-growing Android
phone business, whose China launch
has recently been delayed by Google.
Google’s Chinese head-quarters, perhaps soon to be an empty shell should the pull out go ahead.
