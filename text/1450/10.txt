When Ethiopia commenced construc-
tion of a dam on the Upper Omo river
in 2006, groups downstream in Ethio-
pia and Kenya made their opposition
clear. The dam, they said, would affect
communities and wildlife by interfer-
ing with the annual supply of nutrient-
rich floodwaters that nourish grazing
areas and wetlands.
The Ethiopian government argued
a pressing need for hydro-electricity,
dismissing environmental effects as
“minimal”. There is little recourse for
opposing groups. Although in August
2009 a lobby group managed to per-
suade the African Development Bank
(AfDB) to review their financing of the
project on environmental grounds,
construction is ongoing.
The controversy surrounding the
Gibe dam is redolent of an era in which
environmental challenges are increas-
ingly complex and trans-boundary.
The drivers of problems such as water
use, deforestation and pollution are
diffuse and complex, no longer con-
fined to local actions that can easily be
addressed.
What responses have we crafted to
meet this challenge? Global environ-
mental protection consists of little
more than a handful of narrow bilat-
eral and multilateral treaties, under-
pinned by enforcement mechanisms
that relate only to states – whilst inter-
ested parties as well as transgressors
include NGOs and private actors.
There is an apparent mismatch be-
tween the interdependence of global
environmental problems and the ab-
sence of global governance to address
such problems.
Witness the difficulties in secur-
ing agreement in Copenhagen, where
countries struggled to agree a coher-
ent and legally binding response to
the potential threat of climate change.
Consider also hapless attempts to res-
cue the blue-fin tuna from commercial
extinction even as the last viable stocks
are depleted. International companies
are currently free to conduct their
most polluting activities in countries
where environmental controls are
least stringent, with a good chance of
impunity.
Enter the International Court for the
Environment (ICE), offered as a leap
towards multi-lateral, trans-boundary
stewardship of the environment.
Proponents envisage an international
court constituted for the adjudication
and enforcement of existing and future
environmental treaties, underpinned
by a robust lawmaking institution and
permissive of access by a range of par-
ties including states, non-governmen-
tal and private actors.
These are ambitious aims – but then
the court is meant to address an urgent
challenge. Current environmental
protections have failed to stem the tide
of pollution, deforestation, species loss
and other environmental degradation.
But creating such a court outright is
unrealistic and so the ICE Coalition,
which is pushing the proposal, envis-
ages that the ICE could evolve slowly
by starting out as a voluntary dispute
tribunal.
An “interim” court would allow state
and non state actors to seek ad-hoc
clarifications and judgements on en-
vironmental disputes, on a voluntary
basis. The coalition hopes to make
the interim ICE a tribunal of choice
to resolve trans-national environmen-
tal disputes, generating momentum
towards a more universal and binding
court in future years.
A post-Kyoto agreement, if agreed in
Copenhagen or thereafter, might make
a useful testing ground for an interim
court. At present, Kyoto is enforced by
a committee branch with recourse to
the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
- in whose chambers no environmental
dispute has ever been heard. There is
an opportunity for an ICE to fill this
gap in the legal architecture in future
agreements.
However constituted, the ICE will
face the challenge of convincing states
to surrender judgement on environ-
mental matters. Notions of supra-
national justice are already problem-
atic – the International Criminal Court
(ICC) has been labelled biased by some
developing nations for targeting states
opposed to Western interests and val-
ues. The Chinese government rejects
the ICC, whilst the US will not ratify
the agreement because it supersedes
the US constitution.
The interim ICE would be an entirely
different animal, but some states will
undoubtedly view the idea of a global
legal authority on environmental mat-
ters with great suspicion.
Anticipating this, the coalition argues
that developing states would have the
most to gain from an ICE, providing
them access to justice against govern-
ment and private actors who cause en-
vironmental harm to their territories.
Providing locus standi to non-state
actors is an ultimate aim, though the
coalition hints that in order to secure
support from states, private parties
might only secure declarations and
non-binding remedies. This sounds
rather toothless, yet the threat of em-
barrassment before an international
body is a potent lever.
The ICE coalition is optimistic, and
hopes that against the current backdrop
of increasing environmental aware-
ness an interim ICE could be created
in much less than the ten years it took
to create the ICC. An interim court
might not yet forcibly hold states to ac-
count, but it may change the manner in
which international environmental dis-
putes are approached, a so-called “game
changer”.
Reaching the end state will require
hard lobbying, backed up by a success-
ful interim ICE and support from cer-
tain key states. If successful, the posi-
tion of groups like those in the lower
Omo valley might be better heard and
understood in future.

In brief
In a speech to the
Royal Society this
week Nick Clegg
has critisied UK libel
laws for being a ‘le-
gal farce’ and having
a ‘chilling effect’ on
scientific enquiry.
Clegg dubbed the
current group set up by Jack Straw to look into the
case for libel reform as ‘dithering’ and has promised
commitment to greater protection for scientists
and doctors questioning claims made by organi-
sations. He stressed that ‘scientists must be able
to question claims fearlessly especially those that
relate to medical care, environmental damage and
public safety.’ The speech is particularly relevant in
light of the ongoing high-profile libel case lodged
by the British Chiropractic Association against sci-
ence writer Simon Singh.
Call for butter ban
A leading heart sur-
geon at UCL Hospital
has claimed a ban on
butter would save
thousands of lives
each year. Shyam
Kolvekar has said
forcing a reduction
of saturated fat could
see a fall in the number of cases of cardiovascular
diease and save the economy around £8billion in
the process. The claim stems from Kolvehar’s treat-
ment of patients as young as 30 with heart condi-
tions typically found amongst the 50-60 age group.
Whilst an outright ban on butter seems a little ex-
treme, it’s not an idea without support. In North
Karelia, Finland an 82% reduction in heart disease
amongst men since 1969 has been largely attributed
to switching butter for lower fat alternatives.
Nutt’s replacement
announced
Nick Clegg pledges
libel law reform
Professor Les Iver-
son has been named
as the new chair of
the Advisory Coun-
cil on the Misuse of
Drugs following the
sacking of Professor
David Nutt last year.
Prof. Iverson is a re-
tired pharmacologist
and former Oxford academic who himself once
expressed views on cannabis similar to those held
by Prof. Nutt. He is even quoted as having said in
the past ‘cannabis should be legalised’ although he
maintains his view on the subject has since changed
in light of updated scientific evidence. Iverson was
the obvious choice for the position having chaired
the council’s meetings since Nutt’s dismissal.
Meanwhile Nutt and those sympathetic to him are
