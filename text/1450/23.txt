The blaggers guide to being a film geek
News
Strip
With three pints down your throat, the conversation in the pub shifts to some deep intellectual shit. “Have you
seen the new Ken Loach film?” a friend inquires and your heart sinks. Politics you can handle but when it comes
to films, you don’t know diddly squat. To save you from looking like an idiot again I’ve made you a present. So
here’s a nifty little guide for all you philistines who don’t know your Soderberg from your Spielberg.
Legendary Directors
Alfred Hitchcock - Although he turned out
classic after classic Hitchcock never won an
Oscar. When the Academy finally bothered
to award him an ‘honoury’ one, he replied
with the shortest acceptance speech ever -
“Thankyou”. He was a Londoner too.
How a pretentious film geek has different opinions on very popular films
What you would say: What the film geek says:
Forest Gump - Quality Film! The story is really good, I think
it’s really clever how Forest keeps on changing what he does to
keep the audience entertained. Tom Hanks’ acting is amazing!
Saving Private Ryan - The Normandy beach landing is
incredibly realistic and gritty. The film is excellent at portraying
the absurdity of war and the battle at the end is brilliant!
Forest Gump? Moronic Gump is a more fitting title. The episodic
format of the film is tedious and throws no surprises. Tom Hanks’
performance is simply irritating. I recommend If... instead.
Citizen Kane - Old man dies and drops snow
globe muttering ‘rosebud’. News reporters try
but fail to find out what rosebud means, turns out
it’s the name of his...
Directed by and starring the great Orson Welles.
Method Acting - The ultimate style of acting
though peronal experience to truely understand
your character. For example; Robert de Niro
drove a taxi for a year for Taxi Driver.
New Wave - Any movement in cinema in which
a new ethos of filmmaking emerges, the French
New Wave being the most famous.
Auteur - A director with his own unique style
evident in all his films. Stanley Kubrick was one
of the greatest auteurs.
Female fatale - A beautiful woman with hidden
agendas who causes the downfall of a man.
The Fourth Wall - If a character breaks the
fourth wall he directly addresses the audience
like Michael Caine does in Alfie.
High Concept - Film’s premise shortened to one
sentence, think shark eats tourists for Jaws. High
concepts are designed to appeal to big audiences
Kitchen Sink - British Socialist dramas about
the working class usually set in north. The only
reason why anyone has heard of Barnsley.
Akira Kurosawa - The master of Japanese
Cinema. The Good The Bad and The
Ugly, The Magnificent Seven, Star Wars
and Vantage Point are all rip-offs of his
films. He also made Shakespeare actually
entertaining with the epic film Ran.
The ‘Classics’ Speak the Lingo
Vittorio de Sica - During the 50s the
Italians ruled the film world until the
French stole their crown. De Sica’s
‘Neorealist’ films were a breath of fresh
socialist air against the glossy movies of the
Hollywood studio system.
David Lynch - To be really cool you have to
claim you enjoy this guy’s films. Eraserhead
was beyond surreal and then there is
Naked Lunch which will haunt your dreams
for ever. Play the Lynch card in a discussion
on film and you will be worshipped by all.
Casablanca - Humphrey Bogart is happy making
money during WW2 but then his ex turns up with
her hubby needing a favour. Bogey doesn’t want
to help but then he does and there’s some drama
and a happy ending. Oh and there are loads of
Nazis.
The Godfather - Wedding, offers you can’t
refuse, sleeping with fishes, ba da bing, revenge,
Sicily, dead wife, new wife, dead brother, dead
dad, new godfather, lots of shooting, dead Dons,
lying to the wife, kiss my ring!
2001 A Space Odyssey - Ape-men find a big
rectangular rock, ape-man throws bone in the
air. Jump cut to waltzing spaceship. Spacemen
find another rock on moon. Jump cut to different
spaceship, creepy computer goes crazy but fails
to kill Dave. Jump cut to another rock in space, it’s
like the start of Doctor Who. Jump cut to a weird
house, Dave gets old really quickly. Jump cut to
Dave in space, he’s turned into a fetus. The End.
No more Spiderman
for Tobey Maguire
Sam Raimi has walked away
from Spiderman 4 due to
problems with the script. Sony
Pictures have now announced
a franchise reboot without
Maguire concentrating on
Spideys adolescent years. Raimi
is rumoured to be now working
on a World of Warcraft project
Avatar closing in on
Titanic at the box office
James Cameron now holds
the prestigious title of
most successful filmmaker
ever. Avatar has raked in
$1,624,059,398 in worldwide
ticket sales putting it in second
place to Titanic whose total
sales amounted to a whopping
$1,835,300,000
Golden Globe voters
agree with the hype.
James Cameron took the Best
Director award for Avatar which
also won Best Motion Picture.
How the Academy will respond
when the Oscars roll by will be
interesting to see. Meanwhile
Martin Scorsese was awarded
the Cecil B. DeMille prize for
being generally awesome.
I agree that the Normandy landings scene is amazingly reproduced but
Spielberg loses the plot soon after as the film becomes melodramatic
and full of clichés. I recommend The Thin Red Line instead.
