A
sia’s biggest aircraft carrier,
Japan Airlines (JAL), has filed
for bankruptcy protection on
Tuesday this week, in what is
one of the country’s biggest corporate
failures.
The airline owes more than $25 billion to
its creditors, and has vowed to cut 15,700
jobs. A state-backed turnaround organisa-
tion has taken managerial control of the company, and injected 1 trillion yen
($11 billion) to keep the flights in the air.
Shares of JAL, have fallen more than 90 percent since the start of the month,
and with a market value of about $150 million, JAL is now smaller than mi-
nor carriers like Croatia Airlines, and is worth less than one Boeing 747. The
bankruptcy has also had an impact on Japan’s politics. JAL’s problems can
fairly be blamed in part on past Liberal Democratic Party policy, but the re-
cently elected Democratic Party of Japan will have to take the blame if the
reborn carrier fails to soar.

T
he most powerful earthquake to hit Haiti in two hundred years
caused devastation in the country’s capital Port-au-Prince and
the surrounding area. As many as 200,000 people are feared
dead.
At least 70,000 of the dead have already been buried, but accurate figures
will take weeks to emerge. The Haitian parliament was destroyed during the
earthquake, as were a third of the buildings in the capital, and lines of most
communication. The government now convenes daily in a run-down police
station near the airport. The UN mission in the country has also suffered
heavily, losing many of its staff, including the head and deputy head of the
mission. Aid started arriving several days after the incident, and has since
gained momentum, with the United States sending troops and aid through-
out the country.
France and the US almost got themselves embroiled in a diplomatic row
after a French plane carrying a field hospital was turned back from the air-
port at Port-au-Prince by the American forces running the overcrowded
airport. France’s International Co-operation Minister Alain Joyandet said
“This is about helping Haiti, not about occupying Haiti.” French President
Nicolas Sarkozy diffused the tension during a talk with President Obama, in
which they pledged to “unite their efforts to confront the urgent humanitar-
ian situation.”

T
he discovery of a second uranium enrichment plant near the
city The Maran Centaurus, a Greek-flagged supertanker cap-
tured by Somali pirates on November 29th last year, has been
released for a record ransom.
Several reports about the ransom have emerged. One put the sum at
$5.5m, while the other said two separate sums of $7m and $2m had been
paid. Both sums are far larger than the $3m generally believed to have been
paid in January last year for the release of the Saudi-owned Sirius Star, the
largest ship seized by pirates.
The pirates have become increasingly bold and ventured ever further from
their shores since the international community has dispatched as many as 20
military ships to defend cargoes passing through the area. Despite this, last
year saw another increase in the number of ships seized – 47, compared to
42 in 2008. 11 ships, along with 266 crew members continue to be held off
Somalia’s coast.

80. The team sustained the winning
track to triumph 240-110 over Edin-
burgh University.
Chemist Ciaran Healy picked up half
of their fourteen correctly answered

place from a diagram of the knockout
stages of the tournament. Healy suc-
cessfully identified the starter diagram
together with three bonus diagrams
leading to a 75-0 lead in the first 7 min-
utes of the competition.
Simon Good correctly identified
Puccini as the composer of a piece of
classical music during the first music
round. Although the team failed to
give any correct answers for this bonus
round regarding 19th century Italian
operas, Imperial was 105 points ahead
of Edinburgh University after the
eighth starter question.
Edinburgh University Brechin an-
swered all the questions to the bonus
of ‘identifying the Nobel Prize winners
in Chemistry from the committee’s of-
ficial citation’, closing up the gap brief-
ly. Imperial won 240-110 as the gong
sounded. Imperial’s team of Gilead
Amit, Simon Good, Ciaran Healy and
Ben Nicholson and Ed Brightman will
be in the second round of the quarter-
finals next week.
