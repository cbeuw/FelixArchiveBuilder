Insecuri-scopes; everyone horos these, don’t they?
This week’s horoscopes: Selling your confidence by the pound. It’s not making much profit, I’m not going to lie
Cancer
This week you make
the ultimate sandwich.
The ultimate sandwich
consists of a sandwich,
IN A SANDWICH!
You foolishly leave
your ultimate sandwich on the table and when
you come back, you find that your cat has eaten
it. Then you realise that your ultimate sandwich
is in fact still there, but your cat isn’t. NEVER
leave your ultimate sandwich alone with your cat!
Virgo
This week, you’re
fucking a horse, whilst
simultaneously eating
shit vomit, whilst
shitting on previously
vomitted vomit.
Some guy is sitting in his car watching you and
wanking. You’re thinking about pissing and
shitting in a mug and microwaving it just to see
what happens when you come, the horse moans
with delight and then you swap roles.
Gemini
This week, you’re on
University Challenge,
and you realise you
need to do a No.2.
You’re in the middle
of a round, and you’re
prairie-dogging quite badly. Well, it’s basically
in your pants, so you let loose. Jeremy Paxman
notices a smell from the Imperial desk and im-
mediately eliminates your pooey team.
Pisces
Last week you were
researching chaos
theory and the
butterfly effect. You
thought the idea that
that one flap of a
butterfly wing could set off a tornado in Texas
was bullshit so you stamped your foot in protest.
This week Haiti is not fucking happy!
Leo
This week, ketamine
takes over your life.
You literally haven’t
done anything
without some trace
of ketamine in your
body. Everything seems so still for once, and you
don’t like it. The shaky tranquilised world you
love beckons, and sniff sniff, you fall back into it’s
quivering horsey arms. Neighhh. Neeiiiigh.
Aries
This week you’re
messing about with
your friend’s phone,
and stumble across
messages about you.
They are all bitching
about you, and how they hate all the little things
that you do, like clicking your fingers when you
think, rubbing your legs as you eat and touching
your corneas when you’re nervous. No, actually,
you’re just bit of fucking weirdo.
Scorpio
This week, as you walk
into university, your
friends are waiting in
a room for you. They
have a banner hung up,
and you think it’s a sur-
prise party. But your birthday isn’t for another six
months. It’s an intervention, and they say the only
solution to it all is if you didn’t talk to any of them
ever again. As they read out their intervention
statements, you pinch yourself. It’s definitely real.
Libra
This week you stay
home and massage
your sore arse. You
make a mental note to
stick to sheep. Later
on, you’re feeling
hungry and try to walk again. Your housemate
returns to discover you sipping from her mug.
The microwave still smells like hot piss and shit
despite how hard you scrubbed. Perhaps you
could stay with that man who drove you home?
Taurus
This week you’re
bored. You hold a
house party, but
nobody turns up.
Maybe everyone has
coursework, maybe
everyone was genuinely busy. You knew this was
a bad idea. So, it’s you, 5 litres of cheap cider and
two crates of even cheaper lager. The next thing
you know you’ve woken up with a tube down
your throat. Stomach-pumped? Unlucky.
Capricorn
You’re on the number 10
bus to Hammersmith.
The bus hits an
unsuspecting cyclist.
You break the awkward
silence by shouting
‘TEN POINTS!’ The bus driver swiftly moves on,
before anyone can catch his number plate, but
then hits a wheelchair person. You stand up and
yell ‘FIFTY POINTS!’ You’re now hated by every
passenger, but fuck them you have 60 points! Pint?
Aquarius
This week the dildo
you use to keep
you awake during
lectures slips out as
you get up to leave
and slides down
the right leg of your jeans. You try to shake it
out and merge with the crowd of lecture-note
gathering latecomers. The lecturer calls out to
you and everyone turns. She hands you back
your dildo. There’s a smear of blood on it.

Sagittarius
Your friends decide to
show some sympathy
and take you on an
adventure day out.
Bungee jumping, sky
diving, cliff-walking,
deep-sea diving. Wow, you’re in for a treat.
Except they won’t turn up, and they’ve paid the
instructors to sabotage any safety equipment you
might come across and try to use.
