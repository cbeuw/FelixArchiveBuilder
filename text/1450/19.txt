o you know that there are
men out there who watch Sex
and the City for research? La-
dies, the game is up. They know the
Game. They know how to make you
go weak in the knees. So don’t say I
haven’t warned you. Next time you go
on a date and somebody tells you ‘nice
shoes’, take it with a pinch of salt. Or
grill him with an in-depth shoe conver-
sation. Here, is how:
1. What do you think of the col-
laboration between Jimmy Choo and
UGG?
2. Oh how do you say his name? That
Frenchman who designs shoes with a
red sole...
To be honest, 9 times out of 10 the
man can’t even tell the difference be-
tween a pair of pumps and heels. All
that matters to them is colour.
Women and
shoes
Kawai Wong
Kawai Wong Fashion Editor
Last week I braved the weather and
wore a pair of pointy 2-inch Kurt
Geiger court shoes for a change (nor-
mally? Subzero temperatures? UGG...).
After 12 hours of milling about I could
no longer meander the last 200 metres
home. I phoned my brother...
‘Bring UGG and meet me at blah...’
‘A pair of what?’ ‘UGG, UGG boots!’
‘What colour is it?’ And the penny
dropped.
Anyway, want a pair of good look-
ing court shoes that you can survive
in? Head to M&S. Their Insolia range
moves your weight to the back of the
heels so the balls on your feet don’t
ache as much as another pair at the
exact same height. What’s more, the
insoles are leather and the bottom is
water-resistant. £40. What more can
you ask for?
The Style Heroines of Our Time
Rihanna
You may think that she is vulgar. You
may think that with what little cloth-
ing she wears, there’s not much style in
question. You have to look outside the
tabloid images of Rihanna.
Her screen persona is hard and
fierce; an alter-ego, the result of being
a victim of domestic violence. She has
come a long way since her girl-next-
door days when she sang about puppy
love and summer breaks.
RiRi’s success is attributed to her
brillant mix of eclectic pieces with soft
touches. She is forever bang on trend,
but never an avid follower with no
imagination.
At Met Gala 2009, Rihanna executed
the masculine D&G suit with 100%
precision.
She also worked the strong shoulder
trend like no other. Be it an LV dolly
uniform that was worn by Madonna
and the de rigueur Balmain miltary
jacket from last season... She annihi-
lates the ridicularity of an exaggerated
outfit matter-of-factly with her hard
edge confidence.
An advocate for all things edgy; nei-
ther Decarnin’s rock trash, Gaultier’s
fetish, Margiela and Pugh’s quirkiness,
Dior’s feminism nor Chalay-
an’s minimalism will satisfy
her fashion appetite.
In her Hard video, she
sported Jeremy Scoot’s
Mickey ears helmet and
the bullet bra. Alexander
Vaultier’screationfollowed
her from the streets to her
video. Rihanna’s choice
of using British designer
Bryce Aime’s spiky T-Rex
top from her CSM grad-
uate collection has
received national
newspaper
coverage.
She does no fash-
ion faux pas when it
comes to accessorising. The
fuschia bra under a knit top is
a calculated move to add an
edge to a comfy outfit. Her
shades aren’t RayBan. They
are status glasses from Grey
Ant; Beyonce is also a fan.
Nothing about Rihanna is
the norm; she wore a pair of
laced lens glasses by A-Morir
to spice up a Jasmine di
Milo sequin playsuit.
Russian Roulette? Not a
game Rihanna plays when
it comes to fashion.
Lady Gaga
Is it ironic that I’m writing a fashion
article about a woman who resides in
a perpetual state of half dress? Per-
haps, but this particular woman has
had a profound influence over the
couture runways worldwide since her
debut last year. Known for her avant-
garde, provocative style, Lady Gaga’s
latest video, Bad Romance, reads like
a trends list for next spring-summer.
Between the various sets of Agent
Provocateur lingerie and custom de-
signed jewellery, Gaga models a great
portion of Alexander McQueen’s S/S
2010 collection – appropriate, since
she chose to debut the single at his
recent show in Paris this year – es-
pecially notable for some may be the
infamous “armadillo” shoes!
Though McQueen appears to be
the only designer who can feed her
insatiable craving for all things ex-
traordinary, her influence is seen at
every haute couturier worth their salt
– Gaultier, Chanel and Lacroix have
all succumbed to her sartorial power
on their catwalks. However most of
the time Miss Gaga’s getups are de-
signed by her elusive young design
team, Haus of Gaga, whose collective
imaginations have cre-
ated some of the most
memorable stage cos-
tumes – and off-stage
costumes.
An advocate
for all things
unique, outra-
geous and ri-
diculous, Lady
Gaga embod-
ies the fan-
tasy involved
in fashion – she
provides an
unexpectedly
humorous
take on an in-
dustry that is
notoriously
elitist, donning
clothes usually
reserved only for
the catwalk…
No, I wouldn’t person-
ally wear any of her out-
fits, but I do admire her
– she doesn’t just take
from fashion, she gives,
and generously, provid-
ing inspiration and a
vision that is new, not
just dredging up what
we’ve all seen before.
Anna Dello Russo
One of the grande dames of 21st cen-
tury fashion, the Fashion Director At
Large at Vogue Nippon is one of the
women who, along with Carine Roit-
feld, Kate Lanphear and Anna Win-
tour, form the Editrix Elite – an implicit
panel of fashion luminaries who dic-
tate exactly who and what happens in
fashion today.
This is a woman whose fashion acu-
men has been nurtured by fashion’s
most incisive minds. Her style is über-
luxe and full of texture: rich brocades,
heavy silks, sparkling embellished fab-
rics and opulent feathers and furs cre-
ate the foundations of her wardrobe,
with all her outfits littered with her sig-
nature collection of vintage brooches
and jewels. All this, plus arguably the
most enviable shoe collection amongst
the fashion world!
She shuns realism, residing in a cul-
mination of impossibilities: criminally
stylish and incredibly connected, she
synthesises hemlines and bottom
lines atop Kirkwood heels and swans
through Fashion Month in a crimson
Dolce and Gabbana gown paired with
black opera-length leather gloves and
patent YSL Tribute boots at 9am, strap-
less bejewelled emerald Balmain
at lunch and sequinned sil-
ver and green cutout Pucci
for cocktails at 7pm. The
Fashion Editor need not
be any more realistic than
the makeshift arid
desert scene she cre-
ated for the summer
swimwear spread.
Anna Dello
Russo takes
fashion out of
the ordinary.
There is no one
else who can con-
vincingly take
such avant-garde
looks straight off
the catwalk and car-
ry them off with such pa-
nache. Completely differ-
ent from the conservative
English Wintour, the chic
French Roitfeld and the
monochromatic Amer-
ican Lanphear, Dello
Russo is exactly what
one might expect from
an Italian – outrageous,
flamboyant, and a warm,
bubbling personality you
can almost taste from just one
photo.
These women inspire designs on the catwalks, of items, and of our
wardrobes. Saskia Verhagen and Kawai Wong explain.
The lights go out. A hush ripples across
the audience. I tense in anticipation –
it is my first fashion show, and with the
innocence of a child I await a glimpse
of Erdem’s creations. Here I am – the
outsider in my trackpants and hoodie
– worrying that the nuances of fashion
may soar over my head.
Since going solo with his eponymous
label in 2005, Erdem Moralioglu has
been heralded by such luminary or-
ganisations such as the British Fashion
Council and Elle as one of the future
groundbreakers of the fashion world.
The introductory paper I have been
handed says that the range of womens-
wear I am about to see was nominated
for the British Fashion Awards Collec-
tion of the Year. The lights snap on and
the music starts to play.
Although he has a clear penchant for
floral patterns and lacework, Erdem’s
creations display a vibrant range of
styles. A pristine white gown that in-
voked memories of Edwardian times
gives way to a flowing smock remi-
niscent of the 1960’s. A long dress in
the style of the Vietnamese Ao Dai is
my personal favourite, the shimmer-
ing black taffeta background offering
a beautiful contrast to the red, yellow
and pink pansies playing across the
front.
The black lacework for which Erdem
is famous appears more prominently
on a few plain-coloured dresses, its
intricacy dovetailing nicely with the
sedate colours chosen. A selection of
models sport his other speciality, floral
prints – a profusion of green, cream,
red and blue capturing the joie de
vivre of a summer day. That is not
to say that his work is flawless – a
jarring maelstrom of different flow-
ers in a sea of red provides one of
few blots on his landscape – but
the subtlety of much of this work is
elegant.
The make-up, done by Andrew
Gallimore, is minimalistic and suits
the show perfectly. In fact, this aspect
serves as a microcosm for the entire
collection – high quality fashion you
could picture any girl on the street
wearing. It is proof that one does not
have to be an expert to appreciate fine
couture. As in music, drama or litera-
ture, something well-crafted appeals to
experts and amateurs alike.
At the end of a fascinating fifteen
minutes, the man himself walks out,
accepting the audience’s applause with
the modesty and grace evident in his
work.
The audience ghosts out to the
strains of a violin version of Nirvana’s
Come as You Are - an unexpected and
fitting end to a show that has surpassed
all my expectations.
