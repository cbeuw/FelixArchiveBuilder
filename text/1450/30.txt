FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010
Aristotle: “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,450
Solution 1449
Last issues obligatory mistake was
placing the ‘E’ in the bottom left box
of the Evil Wordoku one cell lower
than it ought to have been - produc-
ing two valid solutions and hiding the
word MISEROTIA. Be rest assured
I have received a sound beating. Big
hand to winner of last week’s easy- GL
Tang, please provide a name. Can’t
remember the evil winner. Sorry.
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then send
the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. You will
not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate - just
solve it like normal and insert the letter that you believe
makes the word.

Standing on
the table?

I
assumed that during exams you
would all be furiously masturbat-
ing over these puzzles. It turns
out that I was correct. Like some
sort of Claire Voyant. Have you ever
thought about being a girl for a day?
I have, and drew the conclusion that
it would be a considerable amount
of fun trying to fuck up some poor
hockey fresher’s mind. But then again
I am a massive fan of psychological
maiming. In the past it has regularly
proved to be highly successful.
Moving on from maiming the gen-
eral public, this week the Union has
finally got round to installing the new
Union Bar’s Dignity Drainpipe. In
a risky manoeuvre, Union President
Ashley Brown decided that too many
people were simple throwing their dig-
nity away to anyone who happened to
be in the bar drinking. Or vomiting.
Or pissing- got to cover all the bases,
the Rugger Bugger boys may be in. So,
after a colossal fuck-up which saw Col-
lege confuse Boris with a few diversion
signs, thus sending him to the wrong
bar, Ashley stepped in to unveil the
new Dignity Drainpipe.
Standing on a table (fucking health
and safety brap!), in the bar, packed
with sportsmen, on Wednesday night
Ashley went mental. He started to
scream at people like some sort of des-
perate paedophile ‘I am the President
give me your dignity. You common
scum! I run this fucking place.’ At first
he received some strange looks, which
for Mr Brown, is not unusual. But af-
ter a while the ‘common scum’ realised
that what Ashley was doing was in fact
being the first contributor to his new
venture. Adding to the funeral pyre of
dignity, a Rugby fresher mistook Ash-
ley’s rambling for some sort of sexual
invitation. At this point Brown realised
that he was probably a) making limit-
ed sense and b) a bit twatted. He took
himself home, not to resurface until
lunchtime the following day.
In other news, Haiti appears to have
been fucked by a giant horse-come
-stallion. Judging by the destruction it
appears that this horse was on hardcore
crack. Not good, it spoilt quite a few
people’s days. It brought me back to the
(slightly less severe) flooding in Britain
in the summer of 2007, when the Rt.
Rev Graham Dow, Bishop of Carlisle
pronounced that the flooding was due
to an increase in pro-gay legislation.
Arsehole.
Stuff Imperial students like:
11. Americans:
Americans! They are back, and back
in force. We love them, coming over
here and learning about our cul-
ture. They are a huge amount of fun
and all seem to be called by strange
names like “Hope”. Never-the-less
they are a huge amount of fun, and
game for a laugh. Or downing a
pint. Slowly. Next one you see, just
slip a casual penny into the glass
and yell ‘GET IT DOWN’ really
loudly at them. Watch their little
faces drop.
I digress. The point is that they
really do contribute a lot to the
life here at Imperial and it’s amaz-
ing that we have the opportunity to
share our experiences and relate the
theirs. I personally really look for-
ward to their biannual invasion.
Not really. I was shitting you. Just
put a not in every sentence.
God bless America? You taking the piss?
mmmmmm.....

Wordpath 1,450
INTERMEDIATE
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
