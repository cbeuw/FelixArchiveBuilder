IC UNION SAYS
'YES' TO EEC
AT A poorly attended meeting last Thursday IC Union overshelmingly voted in favour
of Britain remaining in the Common Market. The debate was, on the whole,characterised
by a distinct lack of knowledge about the issues involved'.
IC R A G
O R N O T ?
A F T E R A N extremely
s u c c e s s f u l year c o l l e c t i n g a
massive £8,500 for charity, the
IC R a g Committee h a s decided
that it wants a new name.
One suggestion put forward
was that of LIMP ("London,
Imperial) Rag, with a crutch
as its symbol, but since this
might cause offence to certain
charities, the R a g committee
decided against i t .
Now, a competition has
been initiated for the purpose
of finding a new name. The
prize is to be a bottle of whisky
and a l l suggestions for the
new name should be sent to:-
R a g , I C U n i o n Office, on or
before Wednesday 28th M a y .
All suggestions will be
welcomed.
The main motion w a s
introduced by Terence P y e .
T h i s w a s immediately followed
by a 'delete a l l and insert'
amendment by I C U President
Trevor P h i l l i p s . He spoke at
length on the undemocratic
nature of the Common Market
institutions, and asserted that
the powers of d e c i s i o n making
would be removed from the
elected representatives a n d
placed in the hands of the
B r u s s e l s bureaucracy. T h i s
was followed by speeches for
and against the amendment,
with the main speeches
against' concentrating on the
theme that "we are already in
Europe and we would lose far
more if we got Out than stayed
in." T h e speeches against
were similar to Trev P h i l l i p s '
proposal speech except that
more details were added to
back up the arguments that had
already been stated. T h i s
M o r e o n H a m l e t G a r d e n s
F U R T H E R T O the story on
Hamlet Gardens (front page,
F E L I X N o . 387), the IC U n i o n
E x e c have come to a decision
regarding the composition of
the committee for s e l e c t i n g
new applicants.
It w i l l c o n s i s t o f the
President, the H o n . Secretary,
the Warden a n d one of the Sub-
wardens of the head tenancy
scheme.
20% of the places w i l l be
going to re-applicants a n d the
r e m a i n d e r w i l l go to n e w
applicants. T h e Warden i s to
have the same powers of selection
of re-applicants as the other
wardens.
A d d i t i o n a l l y , it was further
d i s c l o s e d that the selection
committee is to give preference
to married students where both
parties are I C students. There
is a l s o to be approximately the
same percentage of places going
to each group (second-years,
third-years, P G ' s ) a s there are
applicants in each group.
• See page 3
brought a riposte from the
R S M U President, JohnMortiner,
who asked the House not to be
taken in by these ' d e t a i l s ' . He
went on to defend B r i t a i n ' s
membership a n d concluded
that we are better off staying
i n . Trev P h i l l i p s i n summing
up a c c u s e d John Mortimer of
using " cheap debating points."
The amendment was then put
to the House and defeated.
A second amendment was
then presented w h i c h stated
that I C U should not take a
definite stand on the i s s u e ,
and that each student should
not take a definite stand on
the i s s u e , and that each
student should be left to
himself (or herself) to decide
which way to v o t e . T h i s
amendment was a l s o defeated
whereupon the debate on the
substantive was resumed. Then
were further speeches on the
motion with the most notable
one coming from the P G Affairs
Officer, T o m Abraham in which
he broke with his left-wing
colleagues by coming out i n
favour of E E C membership.
Countering these arguments
Mr P h i l l i p s described Mr
Abraham's points as "Trot-
slcyist tripe". T h e motion was
then voted upon i n parts, the
section dealing with the
p u b l i c i s i n g of I C U ' s position
(by writing to F l e e t Street
papers etc) being taken
s e p a r a t e l y . Both parts were
p a s s e d . A plea that such a
s m a l l meeting should not
mandate its officers to p u b l i c i s e
the opinions expressed i n the
motion of being those of I C U
was ignored.
