CROSS C O U N T R Y
AT ISLE O F M A N
Wilf Welford
T H E I S L E of Man once again provided the setting for the
climax of the cross-country season, and in particular for a mottey
band of 13 runners plus team masseuse, two children and a dog,
representing Imperial College. The f e s t i v a l , organised by the
local athletics c l u b , spans the Easter week-end, as w e l l as a
vast array of running talent,
as c a n be judged from the
results of the 4 mile road race
on Good Friday evening.
The early pace was fast,
until 3V4 miles when a brute of
h i l l brought most mortals to a
shuddering halt. Overcoming
this obstacle with muchaplomb,
Charly A l l i n s o n led the 1st
team home in 63rd in 22:45,
followed by the fast finishing
speedy Steve Webb and an HW
recruit, Stuart L i t t l e w o o d .
Granny C l a r k e closed in for
the first team in 102, to place
the first team 22nd out of 36 .
The second and third teams
were somewhat unnerved by
this h i l l , finishing a humble
33rd and 36th respectively.
The hard surface did Tractor
Houlbrooke a d i s s e r v i c e , and
owing to half shaft trouble, he
was unable to raise sufficient
engine power-'to take part in
the next 2 races. Rob Maddison,
returning from a year's absence
in the depth of P l e s s e y ,
ambled home in 165th, c o n v i n -
c i n g l y last by over 2 mins.
The evening passed peacefully,
until a re-enactment of the
Battle of C u l l o d e n Moor; (the
Scots being Edinburgh Z o o ,
sharing the same hotel as us)—
ButcherCumberland was played
by Steve Webb.
Next morning passed
restfully, after we had polite! y
turned down offers of training
runs of 15 miles and more,
from the energetic Scots: we
thought the rest would enable
us to beat them in the 4 x 3
miles road relay the same
afternoon . Our hopes were
forlorn, though, in spite of an
excellent team performance by
the 1st team, finishing 16th,
and beaten by both Edinburgh
Z o o ' A ' and ' B' teams . R e s u l t s :

Not even the third team
could produce a run to match
that of A . Drunkard (sic) of
Edinburgh Z o o : consuming at
least 2 cans of ale en route,
he sped round in 26.37, a mere
11 mins outside the lap record.
Saturday's festivities were
somewhat limited, in view of
the fact that the now famous
beer-drinking competition was
to be held next day. However,
this did not prevent Ian Isher-
wood from nearly getting
arrested trying to feed c h i p s
to a policeman's dog; the Hair
A r t i s t and Wilf were a l s o seen
doing weird things with w i n d -
screen wipers. Later that
evening, Stuart, after 11 pints
and c h i c k e n and c h i p s , was
obliged to deposit a s o l i d
excess in the s i n k : amazingly,
this was the only ' s p i l l a g e ' of
the week-end.
If Sunday's fell race was
meant to sort out the men from
the boys, then most of us
should s t i l l be in our c o t s .
Proving the exception to the
rule was Charly A l l i n s o n ,
undeterred by the gradients,
leading us home in 63rd a g a i n .
Just behind was Granny,
beating speedy Steve into 76th.
However, our next man home
was a real dark horse (and
pale, more often than not) as
the rest of the 1 st team stood
in astonishment watching Ian
Isherwood romp home in 87th
to be the final scorer for the
first team.
The second and third teams
were evenly distributed in the
f inal50 .Mr Johns on,stimulated
by the presence of his wife at
the top of the f e l l , beat Wilf
again; Pad and Rob Maddison
were credited with equal l a s t .
Several of us ran the 6 miles
back to Douglas, partaking in
the first drinking s e s s i o n of
the day en route.
The serious drinking was
reserved for later that day .The
first team of P a d , Tractor,
Wilf and Stuart won the first
round by a huge margin:
unfortunately, in the second
round, we encountered E d i n -
burgh Z o o and Rossendale, the
eventual f i n a l i s t s , and we
were unable to open our gullets
the extra inch to beat them,
failing by a few s e c o n d s .
Protests of s p i l l a g e fell on
deaf ears, so we were left to
sup at a more sedate rate. The
second team of C H Under (sic
(k)), Hair A r t i s t , Andy Davey
and Charly A l l i n s o n performed
creditably on their debut, just
knocked out in the first round.
The return to Liverpool
next day was fortunately calm,
though several stayed on to
survey the i s l a n d . A Ithough not
quite as eventful as previous
years, we were certainly
stronger in the running depart-
ment than in the past couple of
years, and hope to continue
this trend at next year's
f e s t i v a l .
