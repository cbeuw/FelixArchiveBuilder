P E O P L E HAVE ASKED ME:
"Why are you producing two four-page F E L I C E S per week
as opposed to, say, one eight-pager per week?"
There are two main reasons for doing this. Firstly,
F E L I X has never been produced twice a week, so in some
respects the two-a-week program can be considered as an
experimental pilot scheme just to see if it can be done
single-handed by one person. The answer at the moment
appears to be 'yes it can be done'.
Secondly, it can be stated categorically that with all
the F E L I X staff now studying furiously for exams (they
hurt not only the students who are studying for them) it
would be physically impossible for me to single-handedly
produce an eight (or more) page F E L I X simply because of
process of finishing called 'collation'. This is where one
puts one sheet of F E L I X into another to produce the
finished article. It would take me in excess of six hours
solid to fold, collate, count and stack the 2,200 copies of
F E L I X which are produced'. Sabbatical I may be,Superman
I am not'.
"What are you going to do after your year as Editor?"
It is strange the number of people who believe that my
year as Editor is being used as a stepping-stone into the
metastable world of journalism. Nothing could be further
from the truth. In September I shall be here at IC commen-
cing studies leading to a PhD in one of the specialised
areas of polymer chemistry.
I hope this satisfies everyone's semi- morbid curiosity.

LETTER
BENN AND T H E E E C
Imperial College
I Oth May, 1975
Dear Sir,
I feei 1 must bring to your
attention the hypocrisy of the
ex-hereditory peer and a n t i -
marketeer, Mr Benn .
F o l l o w i n g an anti-European
speech at B r i s t o l University,
he c a l l e d for a show of hands
on whe the r or not B r i ta in s hould
remain i n the E E C . A s at I C ,
the vote w a s massively i n
favour of our continued mem-
bership, showing that, whatever
ridiculour arguments such
anti-marketeers bring u p ,
commonsenac (which the Lefti
Like to c a l l 'ignorance') c a n
p r e v a i l . Mr Benn's reply was,
" 7 think that shows something
of the social origins of
university students ." Undoubt-
edly B r i s t o l , with a medical
s c h o o l of some note, attracts a
fair proportion of'middle c l a s s '
students, but the implication
that there e x i s t s a c l a s s
barrier between those who w i l l
vote yes and no i n the coming
referendum i s a myth t y p i c a l
of Mr B e n n , a p o l i t i c i a n who
thrives on strife .
P e r s o n a l l y I have several
reasons for opposing the
extremes of right and left on
the E E C i s s u e . F i r s t and
foremost comes my future job
security, which w i l l depend;
directly or indirectly, on the
success of private enterprise .
While there i s much c r i t i c i s m
of the ' m u l t i n a t i o n a l s ' , the
massive inflation and recession
following E E C withdrawal
would undoubtedly reduce such
companies graduate i n t a k e .
Secondly, why have three
s u c c e s s i v e governments under
Macmillan, Wilson a n d Heath
found the necessity to apply
for E E C membership? It
appears that throughout the
s i x t i e s our trade with western
Europe and particularly the
six increased, with a corres-
ponding decrease i n trade with
the Commonwealth. N o w that
we are i n the market, without
the tariffs of the last decade,
and commonwealth countries
have found other markets,
withdrawal would be very
s e r i o u s . A l s o , there is the
much talked of issue of
sovereignity. While the
' i n t e r n a t i o n a l i s t s ' on the
Left want us to reinforce our
national barriers and complain
of a loss of sovereignity to
B r u s s e l s , the mere fact that we
are holding a referendum shows
that we have the final c h o i c e .
F i n a l l y , vote yes on June
5th — the result of a no vote,
p o l i t i c a l l y and economically,
on B r i t a i n ' s future, w i l l be
d i s a s t r o u s .
Yours faithfully
F r a n c i s T o y e
PS B r i n g back the eight-page
F E L I X ...please!

Tom Abraham
THIS IS the last 'PiG Affairs Corner' from me. My retirement
date is fast approaching and my s u c c e s s o r , who w i l l be elected
at the A G M on the 15th May, will decide whether or not tocontinue
having a regular column in F E L I X . My personal opinion is that
it is alright provided there are more contributions from rank and
f i l e R G ' s .
The meeting on May 15th
should hopefully mark a high
point in P G affairs. F i r s t
there w i l l be reports from the
principal officers, John Porter
and myself. John w i l l tell you
what we have done with our
money, how much we have
left and what we intend doing
with the remainder. I s h a l l
give an account of my a c t i v i t i e s
during the past year, including
the full truth behind the
"PGAO on the exec?" s a g a .
We hope to follow this with
an important debate on the
status of P G ' s — whether we
should be treated a s research
workers and be paid a reason-
able wage orwhetherwe should
remain a s students. There are
advantages and disadvantages
in both but on balance I feel
that being c l a s s e d as 'research
workers' would be better. T h i s
i s , and I would like to stress
this point, part of a national
debate going on among post-
g r a d u a t e s a n d c o l l e g e
authorities about P G research
work. A s a n example, Leeds
University Senate have
proposed a model whereby
postgraduates would be
e m p l o y e d a s ' r e s e a r c h
a s s i s t a n t s ' and given s i x
years in which to produce a
Ph.D thesis — ie actually
contribute towards the
extension of the frontiers of
knowledge.
Should the motion on the
status of P G ' s be passed,
there w i l l have to be immediate
action on one of the principal
demands, which is that a l l
" t u i t i o n " fees for postgraduate
research students be abolished.
There is also an important
motion to be introduced by
Richard Upton dealing with
the relationship between the
PG group and College as well
as with the Union. At the
moment our powers are not
clearly defined. I feel that
ICPGG should demand complete
policy-making control over PG
affairs and ask that ICU and
the College recognise our new
role.
I hope a s many of y o u a s
possible w i l l try to come to
the A G M in E l e c E n g 407 at
1pm on Thursday May 15th.
The points to be d i s c u s s e d are
very fundemental in nature and
s i n c e it affects every single
postgrad in C o l l e g e , it is in
your interest to try and attend
this meeting.
BLOOD DON ING
ON W E D N E S D A Y , Thursday and Friday of this week a team
from the South London B l o o d Transfusion Centre w i l l be v i s i t -
ing the College in a further attempt to extract blood from
students. The details of the s e s s i o n may be found elsewhere
in this issue and dotted around the C o l l e g e , s o I w i l l not repeat
them here, except to emphasise for the s a k e of old hands (or
arms!) that the venue has changed from the Union Concert H a l l
to Southside Lower Refectory. The change is due, not to a
nefarious Mooney plot, but to a Dramsoc super-epic on the days
in question.
In this article I merely want to point out the urgent and
continuing necessity for blood in our hospitals, and to attempt
to put paid to some of the myths, half-truths and old wives'
tales that people trot out when seeking to justify their refusal
to give blood.
F i r s t l y the need for blood i s urgent. A large proportion of
the blood taken during a s e s s i o n i s delivered to the hospitals
the same day, and never even sees a blood bank. Blood i s
usable for up to three or four weeks after donation and the
small percentage that reaches this age is not wasted, but turned
into plasma which w i l l keep indefinitely. So N O blood i s wasted.
Secondly, It doesn't hurt, honest, folks. You merely feel a
pin-prick in the arm, and that's it. The blood removed, which
amounts to r o u g h l y % o f a pint is replaced within a few hours
and y o u ' l l never know it was m i s s i n g . It i s true that people
have been known to feel faint or d i z z y after giving blood, but
in the main this is more psychological than p h y s i c a l .
Thirdly, it does not take a long time. A t most the whole
process takes 40 minutes, and t y p i c a l l y you can be away in
half an hour - including tea and b i s c u i t s .
In c o n c l u s i o n , I would just like to urge you a l l to be p u b l i c -
spirited next week and give freely of your c o r p u s c l e s , you
never know when the compliment may have to be returned.
Ian McWalter
