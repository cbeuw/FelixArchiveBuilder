"Hamlet Gardens Shock"
FURTHER TO our front-page lead of the same name last Friday (FELIX No.387), DAVE SALISBURY, the
IC Union Student Residence Officer, has written this article in reply.
I H O P E to write an answer to the
artic le on Hamlet Gardens which appeared
in the issue of F E L I X dated 2nd M a y .
The headline has a sub-title of "Clique"
Perpetuation" A Negations Made. I have
found that one dictionary defines clique
as an associated number of persons or
an e x c l u s i v e s e t . The second meaning is
nearer that usually meant at I C . T h i s is
that it is a small number of students who
w i s h to exclude any other students they
do not want with them, l a m informed by
the Warden of Hamlet Gardens that those
students in the flats during the s e s s i o n
73/74 and who wished to remain for
s e s s i o n 74/75 were able to remain in the
flats. In one way it may be interpreting
the word clique liberally, in that it
excludes some new a p p l i c a n t s . However
it hardly lives up to the sensational
headline of the article: there is not a
small band of students living in Hamlet
and Cambridge Gardens e t e r n a l l y .
"..Jhere is not a small band of
s t u d e n t s living in H a m l e t and
Cambridge Gardens eternally."
I was accused of setting up a clique
in the second paragraph by trying to
allow reapplicants to remain in residence
for next year. If this is s o then the
reapplicants who were s u c c e s s f u l last
year are a l s o a clique, s i m i l a r l y the year
before e t c .
The third paragraph points out that
Trev P h i l l i p s questioned my stance on
the issue of Hamlet Gardens . F i r s t my
stance on Hamlet Gardens, which w a s
presented at C o u n c i l on Monday 28th
A p r i l .1 proposed two motions, the first
being that the reapplicants for the s e s s i o n
75/76 be allowed places, the second
motion w a s that the exec 75/76, Student
Residence Officer 75/76, and Warden of
Hamlet Gardens 75/76 should meet to
consider formulating any rules and
regulations which may subsequently
apertain to Hamlet Gardens and Cambridge
Gardens.
"Jacqui Gerrard then agreed with the
article as a whole saying that she
thought it was okay."
My reasons for these proposals are
as follows. During last term Jacqui
Gerrard asked if I would write an article
to appear in F E L I X which would explain
the situation with regard to w h o is able
to live in H a l l s , Houses and F l a t s . T h i s
explained the various quotas, e g . 12%
reapplicants, 18% P G ' s e t c . in H a l l /
H o u s e s . The paragraph dealing with the
F l a t s w a s reasonably vague as there d i d
not appear to be many firm ru les . Y o u may
remember the sentence "// Is policy that
students wishing to have a second year
in the flats have first choice of which flat
and get priority over first time appli-
cants." I wrote a draft copy of the
article which Jacqui Gerrard, A n n Henley,
(Residence C l e r k at the time), Shaun
Crofton (Warden)and MrSeaford (Domestic
Bursar) a l l read. Jacqui Gerrard objected
to the words "Union policy" in the above
sentence which appeared in the draft. I
changed this by dropping the word "Union"
along with other minor corrections into a
second draft which had the sentence
as above. Jacqui Gerrard then agreed
with the article as a whole saying that
she thought it w a s okay.
The article appeared on Monday
( F E L I X was late that Issue) 10th March.
C l o s i n g date for applications w a s 2 1 s t
March - less than two weeks later. I
therefore assume that students reading
this article take it as being truthful - a s
I d i d . Now Trev P h i l l i p s a n d J a c q u i
Gerrard are effectively saying this is not
to be s o . But when did they s a y s o ? Not
a month or s o before c l o s i n g date but a
matter of days before c l o s i n g d a t e . No
public notice of this appeared in F E L I X
until the article presenting a biased view
appeared. A n y changes in the method of
selection should be made public a month
in advance at least.
"Any changes in the method of
selection should be made public a
month in advance at least."
T h i s time factor is my main reason for
the first proposal I put to C o u n c i l , which
was defeated by a narrow margin. Next Is
that instead of reapplicants being notif-
ied before or about the end of the E a s t e r
vacation and new applicants notified soon
after we have the situation where the
forms (266 for 146 places) have not been
sorted through. T h i s is a drop in the
standard of service for some students
that is not to be tolerated.
"This is a drop in the standard of
service some students that is not to
be tolerated."
I obtained two lists of residents of
the F l a t s relating to the s e s s i o n s 73/74
and 74/75. No list is available for the
previous years 71/72 and 72/73. Upon
sorting through these lists I have found
that less than 3 0 % of the places are
occupied by reapplicants, not s m a l l
enough to be a clique but not b i g enough
to be "the same old clique'that gets in
year after year" that w i l l not allow any
new applicants is it? Some students may
remember the circumstances surrounding
the setting up of a Warden . He w a s to be
an administrator and to keep a more
rigourous control of d i s c i p l i n e a s there
had been a large number of complaints
from the neighbours. Having been a
member of the Student Hall Committee I
hope I am not misrepresenting H a l l
Wardens by saying that they do not w i s h
to have a very large proportion of fresh-
men because they consider the H a l l s then
lack d i s c i p l i n e . I feel consequently
that the F l a t s need reapplicants w h o are
hopefully going to exercise some self-
control.
A g a i n in the third paragraph of the
article Trev P h i l l i p s is reported as
condemning the action being taken over
Hamlet Gardens "which directly contra-
dicts Union policy" to quote the a r t i c l e .
In my copy of the Union policy document
which a Union meeting w i l l be asked to
ratify as true, there is no mention of
Hamlet Gardens Cambridge Gardens, Head
tenancy flats, Union F l a t s or any other
name under which they may appear. So
the article is wrong there and the only
action s o far taken over Hamlet Gardens
is to suspend the selection of applicants
which Trev has done. T h e matter of
Hamlet Gardens has been d i s c u s s e d at
some exec meetings but no firm action has
been decided on selection policy as far
as I k n o w .
"I f e e l ... t h a t the F l a t s n e e d
reapplicants who are hopefully going
to exercise some self-control."
A brief resume then of why I d o not
agree with what has happened/ is
happening/ is not happening over the
F l a t s :
1 . My article of 10th March about Student
Residence .
2 . The intervention of Trevor Phi Hips and
Jacqui Gerrard only after this article had
been published whilst Jacqui Gerrard
had seen the article before it went to
FELIX and had okayed it.
3 . That any d e c i s i o n now reached means
there has been a time delay for applicants
— a drop in the standard of s e r v i c e .
4 . Present occupants at the beginning of
the year (perhaps) knew that they would
be able to remain in the F l a t s now find
that they may not necessarily be able to
do s o but onjy just before the c l o s i n g
date for a p p l i c a t i o n s .
The above hopefully gives a true
indication of what is happening at Hamlet
Gardens and should correct what w a s an
erroneous a n d misleading a r t i c l e . What
more can I say? (A part from petty bitching).
REVIEW
F I L M
Tommy (Director Ken Russell)
IN T H E film version of Pete Towns-
hend and the Who's R o c k Opera "Tommy",
Ken R u s s e l l ' s strong, weird images react
negatively, for the most part, with the
m u s i c . Only in one or two scenes d i d
what was happening on the screen add to
the power of the second track.
Many of R u s s e l l ' s images were clever
and had something to s a y , many were not
and had not,and almost without exception
theyall failed to find sufficient relevance
to the music and l y r i c s . T h i s w a s not
aided by Ann-Margret (Tommy's Mother)
and Oliver Reed (her lover) who, while
looking good and a c t i n g w e l l , respect-
ively, cannot s i n g . C a n someone explain
the relevance of Ann-Margret swimming
in s i x inches of baked beans which have
spewed from a smashed T V ?
The two extra numbers written in by
Pete Townshend, to add some extra
continuity, are not up to the standard of
the other songs.
The two places where I felt the
v i s u a l s complemented the music where
in "Amasing Journey" and "Eyesight to
the Blind". They just failed to do s o in
"Acid Queen" which w a s pushed a little
too far.
Guest Artist summary: Elton John a s
the " P i n b a l l W i z a r d " — good enough;
T i n a Turner a s the " A c i d Q u e e n " — a
touch overdone; J a c k N i c h o l s o n as the
doctor, E r i c Clapton a s the preacher,
Robert Powell a s Tommy's Father, and
Keith Moon as Uncle E r n i e — superb,
great laugh.
Roger Da I trey does well as Tommy,
he's had seven years practice. If y o u ' l l
take my advice — y o u ' l l buy the original
Who album, settle back in your head-
phones, c l o s e your eyes, and w h i l e away
111 minutes that way. But if y o u like
your mind crushed
