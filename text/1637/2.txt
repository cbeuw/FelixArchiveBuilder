ou know when you’re
at a party and you’re in
a group of people that
gets onto talking about
what month you were all born in,
and then you all start counting
backwards nine months to see if
it was Valentine’s Day, or New
Year, or the date of an infamous
powercut in your home town? Then
you all start announcing whether
you were accidental babies or not
(I was “meticulously” planned, as
my mother loves to remind me
– ew) and someone in the group
will inevitably claim that they were
some kind of miracle baby, that was
statistically unlikely, mathematically
impossible, and that the doctors
said it could never happen? This
newspaper, that you are holding, is
that baby.Don’t roll your eyes at this
miracle-baby-now-adult-at-a-party,

servers decided to cut out half-
way through Wednesday rendering
InDesign, the internet, and all
of our templates untouchable, is
an honest-to-God miracle of the
purest and most beautiful kind.
This issue came into being on
laptops, as opposed to multiple
high-powered Macs in our little
media basement. This was a stark
reminder of how FELIX used to
be put together back in the day –
our very own offset litho printing
machines in the office, hand-
collation of the pages in the middle
of the night, and literal cutting and
pasting.
And yes, it’s extra-lite this week,
almost leaflet-like, in fact. But I
know that during exam season, you
don’t have time to read swathes
of FELIX, however nuanced,
insightful or engaging. You want
news, some snappy comment pieces,
your horoscopes, and hella puzzles,
and that’s what this issue has for

you. I get you guys. It’s taken me
25 issues, but I finally get you guys.
So here, is our zine-like issue, made
(literally) by hand, from me, to you,
my children.
If I’m sounding a little more
Biblical than usual, it’s because I’ve
just had a miracle baby.
In response to 'My
#MessagetoFemenists' Issue #1636
The central part of your article
is the question “Why not embrace
the criticism and use it to benefit
and reform the movement?” to
which my response is that feminism
does acknowledge criticism, then
subsequently either accepts and
adapts or demonstrates why the
criticism is flawed. For instance
you claim the concept of privilege
(that people with characteristics
from traditionally dominant classes
will tend to benefit from those
characteristics directly or indirectly)
is flawed but give no explanation.
You also claim that intersectionality
is flawed because it separates people
in to different groups, to which I say
that it’s important to observe how
different power structures affect
different groups of people. For
instance the way a lesbian woman
and a straight woman experience
sexism may be similar in lots of
ways and different in others, your
argument is to ignore that different
groups are treated differently which
seems nonsensical.
The rest of your article touches
on ideas like political correctness,
censorship, loss of free speech etc.
but they’re only mentioned in
passing and no case is made that
any of these problems are common
or are perpetuated by feminism. I’d
love to write an article in response
to your points but I can’t decipher
many between the buzzwords.
Please contact me if you’d like to
chat about feminism over coffee
some time, it’d be great to hear what
your opinions actually are and get to
debate them with you. Same goes
to anyone who found themselves
agreeing with Arnold's article.

Some of y'all more familiar
with FELIX's brand this year
might have been confused by the
inclusion of last week's "article"
on "feminism". I hope you all took
it to mean that we will literally
publish anything, regardless of
the writer's idiosyncratic views,
because, you know, freeze peach
and all that.
I'dliketodirectanyoneelseriled,
or indeed inspired, by Arnold's
article to flick to page six and read
Christopher Worsfold's charming
response.
