ceanic toxin levels have
increased due to harmful
algal blooms (HABs)
which plague shellfish
and in turn affect the humans
that consume them. Recently
NOAA and partners deployed an
underwater robot that measures
toxicity. The robot, known as the
Environmental Sample Processor
(ESP), was made at the University
of Washington, and will monitor
cell and toxin concentrations of the
HABs caused by Pseudo-nitzschia
on the north-west coast. ESP can
detect the toxin domoic acid which
gives scientists a better assessment
of the HABs’ toxicity levels. The
data collected by the ESP will be
sent to scientists, coastal managers
and public health officials in near-
real time so they can support
decisions related to potential
shellfish harvesting closures. This
decision-making is critical for
the coastal communities that will
experience financial hardships due
to the closure.

t Sh!t Sc!ence, we like to
show how all science is
special, a little bouncing
1-UP that your character
runs towards to let it continue
through the game. This version
of Sh!t Sc!ence is a little different.
Because this week, I’m not going
to be talking about research that
sounds silly, or useless. This week,
I’m talking about research that, to
me, sounds so cool it makes my eyes
water a little bit.
To 30-year-old me, the game
Super Mario Bros was the source
of the happiest and saddest times a
ten-year-old could ever experience.
Two dimensions, 8-bit music, and a
moustachioed plumber who could
only do one thing: hop, meant
hours and hours of game play fun.
But game play in those days was
hardcore. You got a set number of
lives, and when you lost them, you
were out. End of game. Mental
Breakdown. You would always hear
about that kid, the friend of a friend

Reminiscent geeks confirm: Super Mario Bros is hard
of a friend, who actually finished
the game. The story of the kid who
defeated Bowser would spread like
an urban legend. But for you, it was:
start all over again and die at the
exact same place. Again.
That unassailable sense of defeat
has haunted me throughout the
rest of my life, a tiny niggling
reminder that no matter how hard
I tried at that game, I always failed.
But now the children of the 80s
have grown up and are using
mathematical proof to show
that we weren’t all that stupid.
In a paper that will be presented
at the FUN16 conference, the
8th
International Conference
on Fun with Algorithms,
a group of mathematicians
from MIT, the University of
Ottawa, and Bard College at
Simon’s Rock, will present their
latest mathematical analysis
breakthrough which proves,
once and for all, that Super
Mario Bros. is super super hard.
They show that the problem
of solving a level in Super
Mario Brothers is as hard as
the hardest problems in the
“complexity class”,meaning that
it’s even more complex than the
travelling-salesman problem, or
the problem of factoring large
numbers, or any of the other
hard problems belonging to the
better-known complexity class:
NP.

sense of
defeat has

ery few of us are here at
Imperial because we’re
interested in the inner
machinations of the
political beast. But as argued lately
in FELIX, science and scientists
need to wake up and start caring
about science and policy. Besides
being a way to sell ourselves better
and increase funding from one of
our largest donors (the government),
gathering technical knowledge and
transforming it into human wisdom
requires prescience about how it will
affect society. And one of the most
powerful, overarching frameworks
for societal influence is politics.
In some fields, like theoretical
mathematics, the link between
science and policy is difficult to tease
apart, but in others, such as climate
studies, it’s quite obvious. Well
known governments desperately
need to start implementing policies
to establish a future that’s adaptable
to rapidly changing climate
conditions. Science is one of the
only tools through which we can
predict what that future may look
like. However, policy-makers in
the UK and many other western
countries are largely not trained in
science,its technical language,or the
implications of it.As a result,despite
the existence of in-house policy
translators, scientists themselves
need to be already tweaking their
messages for policy-makers.
Professor Martin Siegert of
Imperial recently co-authored a
paper on the Totten Glacier of
Antarctica, potentially predicting
an additional three metres to on-
going sea level rise. These types of
stark scientific numbers can serve as
powerful political forces, but need
to be framed the right way to get
the message across.
Siegert argues that it’s important
for the scientific community to
“translate scientific research to
decision-makers, wherever they are,
as we have a loss of knowledge and
expertise as we move from science
to decisions”.
While not all of us will be studying
political sciences, we should always
think just how our research can have
policy impacts to benefit society,
and be able to frame it accordingly.
Ultimately, this may be some of the
greatest meaning our work has.

I
get angry waiting for Google
Maps to load on my iPhone
and I tell this to Jan-Peter
Muller, Professor of Image
Understanding and Remote Sensing
at the Department of Space and
Climate Physics at UCL. He looks
as if he’s experienced a similar thing.
“If you think 3G or GPRS is bad,
try processing an image of Mars”.
It takes a 24 core, 96 GB ram
machine three whole days to process
a single image of Mars taken on
a HiRISE camera, a camera so
powerful it had to be downgraded
by the US Military before being
donated to science. Muller asserts
that these are the highest resolution
images ever seen by civilians from
space. Using The Martian to invoke
discussion on Mars is becoming
rather clichéd a year on from its
cinema release, however, if ever we
had a chance to see Mark Watney
waving to us from his hydroponic
Martian garden, this would be it.
The revolutionary new technique
published in Planetary Space Science
by Muller and his co-author Yu Tao
in April is called super-resolution
restoration (SRR). By stacking and
matching up to eight telescopic
images of the same area taken from
different angles, resolution can be
increased five times. So now each
pixel represents 5cm compared to
25cm,meaningthatinthisparticular
case, we can tell why Beagle-2 failed
from an orbit of 300km.
There is no doubt that being able
to image in this way will aid our
understanding and planning in
space exploration. Muller himself is
in favour of human exploration and
colonisation of other planets.
“I am of the belief”, Muller says,
“that if we don’t hurry up, then an
asteroid will take us out and no one
will ever know we existed”.
So far, so Armageddon. But
despite its “enormous implications”
for solar system exploration, it is
actually the implications for our
own planet that excite Muller. High
resolution imaging could herald
developments in precision farming,
urban planning, traffic control,
virtual reality technology, citizen
science and most pressingly,accurate
assessment of environmental
change.

How new super resolution imaging technology can help mankind
reach for the stars
“At this point, it’s a technology
demonstration,” says Muller, “but
the computing power is likely to get
much better”.
That does not mean he has eased
off developments in space.
“Next is the moon!” he says, to
alleviate the concerns of the “flat
earth people out there who still
think we never went (there)! And
we need to find Philae!”
Maybe he can do that whilst he’s
waiting for those images of Mars to
process.
If we don’t
hurry up,
