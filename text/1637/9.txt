Science, what’s good?
You’d think that if there’s a clear
indicator of alcoholism, it’s the
consumption of alcohol. However,
a study from North Carolina State
University showed that posting
about alcohol on social media might
actually yield more information
about the poster’s risk of alcoholism
than their actual drinking habits.
The researchers, who surveyed 364
actively drinking undergraduate
students, found that the regular
consumption of alcohol was
connected with a certain “alcohol
identity”, meaning the behaviour
was considered an integral part of
who the students were.This identity
was broadcast on social media
networks to coordinate, advertise
and facilitate drinking. The
researchers hope that their findings
will help identify individuals at risk
of alcoholism and aid policymakers
in intervening where strong alcohol
identities may indicate high risk
populations.

Many organisms on earth have
co-adapted over millions of years
and are now codependent. This
codependence can be the cause
of a mutual extinction though, if
one organism becomes threatened.
This is the scenario a tiny tentacled
flatworm is facing, as it lives on
the surface and often in the gills
of a small freshwater crayfish from
eastern Australia. The many species
of mountain spiny crayfish have very
small ranges and 75% of all species
in the continent are endangered or
critically endangered. Researchers
from the UK and Australia looked
into the risk of co-extinction
through the use of computer
simulations. They found that if
all mountain spiny crayfish went
extinct, 60% of all temnocephalan
symbionts would follow the same
road to oblivion, starting with
the most evolutionarily distinct
lineages. Such an event would mean
the loss of up to 100 million years of
evolutionary history.

If you’ve ever had to cram the
night before an exam, this may not
come as a surprise to you, but a new
study has identified the crucial role
of REM sleep in the process of
memory consolidation. The team
of researchers at the RIKEN Brain
Science Institute, Japan, identified
a particular brain circuit, the
manipulation of which can prevent
or enhance memory retention in
mice, even during non-REM sleep.
The researchers noticed that normal
sleep helped mice remember the
texture of surfaces. The brain
circuit responsible for texture
perception was then manipulated
at different stages of sleep, through
sleep deprivation, silencing of the
pathway and even stimulation of
artificial activity in the brain of the
test subjects. Depending on the
manipulation, mice either failed to
remember familiar textures, or at
times their memory became twice as
strong as normal. So don’t sacrifice
your sleep kids. Especially the night
before an exam.

Many studies over the years have
highlighted the importance of
our surroundings for mental and
physical well-being.Earlier this year,
Professor Mark Nieuwenhuijsen
from the Centre for Research in
Environmental Epidemiology
claimed that living near expanses
of green could prolong lifespans.
So it comes as no surprise that
living near landfills might have the
opposite effect. Researchers in Italy
investigated whether air pollutants
emitted from landfills could have
adverse effects on human health.
They monitored 242,409 people
from the Lazio region from 1996
to 2008. They found a strong
association between deaths caused
by lung cancer and other respiratory
diseases, and hydrogen sulphide,
as people living near landfills were
exposed to on average seven times
the concentration of the pollutant
in comparison to people living a safe
distance from landfills (e.g. Rome).

ood news for England;
teen pregnancies have
halved in the last
15 years. The newly
published Lancet study aimed
at investigating the effect of the
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS)
implemented by the government
in 1999, the purpose of which was
to reduce social exclusion of young
parents due to teen pregnancy.
The decline was more evident in
deprived areas and in areas where
more strategy-related resources were
deployed. Although there is a global
trend of pregnancies occurring later
in the life-cycle of women than they
did in earlier times,due to education
and career often taking priority, the
trend has been more apparent in
England since the TPS came into
effect, suggesting the governmental
policy had a strong effect on the
targeted demographic.

was perusing ‘What to Eat’
by the fabulous nutrition
professor Marion Nestle, and
was particularly intrigued
by her short piece elucidating all
the hoo-ha around yoghurt. Say
the word ‘yoghurt’ just once and
you’re more likely than not to get
a ho-hum reaction. Is it a health
food? Breakfast? Dessert? And wait
– is greek yoghurt actually from
Greece? Well, let’s start with
the basics. Yoghurt is essentially
fermented milk. That 180g tub
you’re holding right now has at least
100 million living Lactobacillus and
Streptococcus bacteria per gram.
That’s 18 billion live bacteria going
in your gut. You start off with a
milk of some sort, be it skimmed,
whole or low-fat, and that’s
pasteurised to kill any unwanted
bacteria. Then the friendly bacteria
cultures Lactobacillus bulgaricus and
Streptococcus thermophiles are added,
together with ‘hardier’ cultures
acidophilus and bifudus strains
because the former two are more
delicate, otherwise known as the
weakling strains.Whatever the type,
they all work hard to digest the milk
nutrients, producing plenty of lactic
acid in the process, the substance
that gives yoghurt its characteristic
tang. Many of these strains are
capable of replacing harmful
bacteria in the gut; therefore yogurt
is typically categorised as the holy
grail of gut health.
A large body of research has
proven that Acidophilus, along
with some other Lactobacillus and
Bifidus strains, do actually survive
the digestion process, which is
not entirely surprising given the
fact that most are already present
in the human gut anyway. These
lovely creatures also consume
lactose in dairy products, making
yoghurt (or even your froyo – yes!)
more tolerable to those who are
lactose-intolerant. Furthermore, a
group of scientists in 2004 wrote a
particularly comprehensive review
on how yoghurt cultures, be it those
weaklings or the hardier boys, are
capable of alleviating symptoms of
constipation, inflammatory bowel
disease and even colon cancer.
The problem lies in the mass-
produced versions. I get a little
cranky thinking about how much
sugar is stuffed into brands marketed
for toddlers and older children–
more than half of your typical GO-
GURT tube is pure sugar. Same
goes for Stonyfield’s YoBaby organic
yoghurts. All the ‘low-fat’ labelling
doesn’t help, because it usually
means all that fat is just replaced
with sugar. I’d think it would be a
far better idea to teach children
how to appreciate something other
than ‘sweet’, and leave the sugary
stuff for real dessert. It’s fine to give
into the sugar-injected yoghurt and
granola pots once in a while, but
on your holier days, try leaving the
dairy aisles with ‘bio’ yoghurt, or
unflavoured sorts with plenty of live
bacteria, and the fewest sweeteners
and chemical additives. Shun your
inner American.
