I

Autobiography Into a Fictional
Second-Person Surreal Coming-
Out-Of-Age Dramedy and Now
My Life Is Happier is not like many
experiences you’ve interacted with
before.In three short,distinct scenes
it captures one person’s coming of
age. Across these the screen focuses
equally on two hands, two heads,
and two bodies. These are two
different people but together they
tell the story of one.
Few games are told from a
second-person perspective and even
less from the perspective of what
seems like two people. When we
view games in the third-person the
player’s role is as an omniscient god.
Our own experience of seeing helps
us understand what is happening
when we play from a first-person
point of view. But playing from
the perspective of two people
causes problems; this is something
we, as humans, cannot relate to
or even comprehend. At first this
would seem like an experience
impossible in real life, however,
this shared perspective could easily
be compared to the conflicting
voices and thoughts in our head.
The popular meme of the shoulder
angel, and devil, is the closest we
have to this in mainstream media
although it is never presented from
an in-body point of view. Whether
developer animal phase consciously
attempted to do this, they have
certainly achieved something
unusual. They have opened up
our imagination to new narrative
perspectives, which will no doubt be
explored by independent developers
in the future.
As the ‘short interactive’ fades to
credits, two blurred naked figures
stand opposite in the shower. As
they touch, the two coalesce into
one. The journey to adulthood can
be seen as the coming together
of multiple personalities and
identities. This is visual storytelling
at its best and gaming at its most
philosophical.
The one night stand has a special
place in popular culture. Dazed and
confused, the protagonist wakes
up in an unknown place beside
an unknown sexual partner. This
situation can play out in a number
of ways.
More often than not, in film
and television, the quick getaway
is the most popular resolution. In
rarer cases, details are exchanged
and friendship or further romance
follows. One Night Stand offers
six alternative endings, six ways to
resolve a super awkward situation.
Multiple endings, as the result
of decisions made by the player,
are nothing new and developer
Kinmoku doesn’t pretend she’s
doing anything revolutionary.
Most games that offer this sort of
branching narrative are long and
don’t particularly benefit from
repeated playthroughs. However,
when a game is around a quarter
of an hour in length the player is
far more willing to experiment and
replay the experience. Whether One
Night Stand ever results in a truly
positive ending is subjective but the
different stories told on the journey
to these resolutions are rewarding.
Borrowing from point and
click games, it is also incredibly
successful in creating a sense
of mystery and capturing the
experience of waking up with a
complete lack of information about
your surroundings. As you try and
piece together the previous night,
One Night Stand also asks questions
about what sort of person you are.
Do you brag to your friends after
successfully pulling? Do you invade
someone’s privacy to work out their
name (which you’ve forgotten)?
There is a real sense of fear that your
alcohol induced amnesia will be
discovered (unless you openly admit
to it).In inspecting the environment
you learn a lot about the mysterious
woman you shared a bed with but

not a lot about yourself.So while the
narrative is branching, there’s never
really any personal development
on your part. This is what makes
One Night Stand refreshing; it’s not
really about you.
