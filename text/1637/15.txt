Documentary corner: Paris is burning
S
hade. What does it mean?
Where did it come from?
For those of us confused
by the lexicon of reading,
kiki-ing, and shade, it would be
a good idea to take a look back to
the 1980s, and Jennie Livingston’s
landmark 1990 documentary Paris is
Burning, which focused on the ball
culture of NYC, and the individuals
making their mark in it. Ball
culture emerged from the LGBTQ
subculture in America, and revolved
around competitions, in which
people would ‘walk’ in order to win
trophies. Different categories would
see individuals try and emulate
a particular type of individual,
such as the ‘executive realness’
category, which involved dressing
up as fantasy 80s businesswomen,
shoulder-pads and all.
The stylish film opened up
the world of balls to the world,
showing us the beating heart that
lay at the centre of the glamour
and glitz: people would be adopted
into ‘families’, which would unite
under a ‘house mother’, serving as
a make-shift support network for
marginalised members of society.
Not only were the individuals
featured in the film ostracised
for being queer, but they were
often separated from the rest of
the mainstream gay community,
in virtue of their skin colour and
gender identity. Paris is Burning
charts the lives of a number of queer
and trans people of colour, such
as Pepper LaBeija, mother of the
House of LaBeija, whose legendary
command continued for thirty
years. While their stories are brave
and extraordinary, they are rarely
uplifting: Angie Xtravaganza, who
ran away to New York at the age of
13, and died of AIDS shortly after
the film was released, only 28 years
of age; or Venus Xtravaganza, a
trans-woman and sex worker, whose
murder forms a major turning
point in Paris is Burning. These
people did not lead charmed lives,
but their work, their sacrifice, their
immense love for those cast out of
society helped pave the way for the
modern intersectional queer justice
movement.
The impact of Paris is Burning is
everywhere; from memes on Twitter
about spilling the tea, to pretty
much every single line quoted on
RuPaul’s Drag Race, the impact
of the ball scene has shaped the
modern cultural landscape. Not all
agreed with Livingston’s portrayal
however, and feminist writer bell
hooks slammed her for reducing the
performance of black bodies to a
mere spectacle for white consumers.
But to approach the work in such
a way seems to belie the openness
with which those featured shared
their lives,and the powerful message
that can be taken away at the heart
of the film. Livingston herself said:
"It's about survival.It's about people
who have a lot of prejudices against
them and who have learned to
survive with wit, dignity and energy.
It's a little story about how we all
survive".
So what exactly is shade, then?
Well, in the legendary words of
Dorian Corey: "shade is I don't tell
you you're ugly but I don't have to
tell you because you know you're
ugly ... and that's shade".
