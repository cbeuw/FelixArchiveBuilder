How much does the Rector get paid?
All this plus a parking space, presumably
T
he college’s Rector does a
very important job. They
go on Radio 4 for us,
they sign open letters in
newspapers, and if you’re lucky and
they’re not having a round off, they
shake your hand at graduation. The
amount these members of staff get
paid is always a point of contention.
This week, we took a look at how
the President’s pay has changed over
the last fifteen years. In that time,
we’ve seen fees for home students
risethreetimes,fivedifferentRectors
and the building of a brand new
campus. Undoubtedly, the Rector
has the power to take the university
in the direction they see fit. Roy
Anderson controversially changed
the university logo from a coat of
arms to the corporate looking text
we have today, and Richard Sykes
tried to introduce a student dress
code that would’ve banned hoodies
and the hijab on campus (which
FELIX adamantly fought, by the
way). Over the years, Imperial has
become more business-oriented
– the introduction of the Business
School, the college’s rebrand and its
multiple management restructures
means that being Imperial’s Rector-
President hybrid (as the post now
is) is a lot like being a company’s
CEO.
And is this reflected in the change
in pay? Our graph above uses data
from a Freedom of Information
request and information freely
available on the college’s website.
Initially,weseeahuge60%increase
in salary when Ronald Oxburgh
passed the baton to Richard Sykes
in 2001. The bump up in spending
in 2008 when Anderson joined is
partially explained by the fact that
Imperial had both him and his
predecessor contracted to work as
Rector during July of of that year.
As you might expect, each new
Rector has received a modest pay
rise on the previous man’s wage.
Keith O’Nions’ was perhaps the
most frugal few years as head. The
fact that his presidency followed the
2008 financial crisis probably has
something to do with it. Andrew
Sykes’ wage grew modestly every
year, meaning he arrived earning
£251,000 and left receiving
£348,000.
Even now, President and Rector
Alice Gast is paid nowhere near
as much as Oxford’s Chancellor,
Andrew Hamilton, whose 2014/15
paypacket at £462,000 makes him
the highest paid university leader in
the country.
In February, the Guardian
reported that chancellor salaries had
gone up 14% over five years – in the
same time Imperial’s top job had
increased its remuneration fee by
21%.
While the average salary for a
university head sits at a modest
£272,000, Alice Gast currently
enjoys a total fee of £432,000 which
includes the college’s contribution
to her pension and £25,000 worth
of ‘Other’ – presumably the rent
on the townhouse that comes with
the job on Queen’s Gate. Imperial
isn’t an average institution, but can
it justify such a decadent pay packet
for those at the top when fees are set
to rise? It probably can, yes.
Keith O’Nions
Affectionately known as ‘Keef’ to
students, and the only Rector with
his own parody Twitter account, Sir
Keith stepped in as acting Rector
after Anderson’s resignation in
2009. Previously the chief science
advisor to the MoD before setting
up a security science institute at
Imperial, he was the first to get the
joint title of President and Rector
after a major reshuffle in the upper
echelons of college governance.
Richard Sykes
As well as trying to introduce a
dress code for students, Sir Richard
was a long-term advocate for
increasing top-up fees. Back in the
noughties, when home students
were paying just £1100 per year,
the government was considering
raising fees. Whilst other Russell
Group chairs suggested £3000 a
year, Richard Sykes told the world
that he thought a whopping annual
fee of £10,500 was justified.
Roy Anderson
Sir Roy Anderson only took on
the job for a brief period starting in
2008, before resigning at the end of
2009. In an interview with FELIX
he said Imperial rising above
Oxford in the rankings was “doable”
and is the only rector of recent years
to have done his undergraduate
degree at the college.
He was another Rector in favour
of top-up fees, but rather less
aggressively than Sykes.
Alice Gast
Imperial proudly boasted of
appointing its female leader back in
2014, when Alice came over from
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.
Of late, President Gast has been
particularly vocal about the
possibility of Brexit, having sent
out emails and signing open letters
that make no secret of her pro-EU
stance.
