London should leave the UK
This is the referendum we ought to be having

e have always been
the greatest, most
prosperous hub for
trade in the whole
of Western Europe. Countless
enemies have dared to invade us, all
with the most unsuccessful results.
Since Roman times, we have always
resisted, preferring death to yield –
always united against tyranny and
oppression. We have survived Great
Fires, Nazi bombings, terrorist
attacks. And we never faltered.
We had never surrendered our
independence.
Sadly, at some point, we ceased to
pay attention, and independence is
not the case anymore. We are not as
self-sustaining as we used to be.
The great City of London is ruled
by a large bunch of bureaucrats in
Westminster, in which only 11% of
members of parliament represent
London constituencies. Long gone
are the days of the great old City
of London. Our self governance
is a myth, a childish, historical
funfact. All the laws that come
from Westminster, which clearly
favor the rest of England and the
UK much more than they favor us,
Men benefit from feminism, but need to know when to listen

W
e’ve all been there
– you finish your
exams and suddenly
there’s a deep hole,
a lack of purpose in your life. What
else was I to do but pick up FELIX
and read Arnold Tan’s “message to
feminists”.
In his article, Arnold gave his
view on the feminist movement,
articulating his own helpful
suggestions. However well
intentioned, for me it felt all too
reminiscent of the Onion article,
“Man finally put in charge of
struggling feminist movement”.
Arnold is by no means the first
man to feel that the feminist
movement could do with his input.
Can we stop talking over women?
If you, like me, spend too much
time on Twitter, you’ll have seen
Piers Morgan recently giving his
valuable insight into what feminism
is doing wrong, tweeting “RIP
feminism”accompanied by a picture
of Emmeline Pankhurst next to a
topless Kim Kardashian. I wonder
what an early 20th
century Piers
(undoubtedly still writing in the
Daily Mail) would have thought
of Emily Davison, the woman who
died throwing herself in front of the
king’s horse campaigning for votes
for women. RIP feminism?
This got me thinking more widely
about why men (I must confess
myself included) feel the need to
involve themselves with feminism.
Because in all honesty, what insight
are voted for by English, Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Irish MPs,
which are obviously not in line with
the interests of ordinary Londoners.
How did London surrender its
independence to the rest of the
UK? It all started as a trade deal,
in which our political decisions
were ours to make, but there was
a general agreement to cut tariffs
between London and the UK. This
then slowly started turning into our
current unsustainable situation.
We started to allow free
movement of people between the
City of London and the UK. We
somehow agreed to share some
common principles. And England,
suspicious of our independence,
built Westminster close to the
City to compete with us, filled it
up with members of parliament
from constituencies coming from
the whole of the UK, and thus set
the age of British dominance in
London politics.
A great example of this problem
is immigration: London has lost
control of its borders. This imposed
policy of open-door immigration
with England has collapsed our
city. We need to take back control
of our borders. We want to decide
who comes in,and whether we want
immigrants from all over the UK to
cometoLondontoclaimourcouncil
houses, collapse our transport
system and steal our jobs. Why do
we have to host, for example, so
many northerners in London? Why
can't we democratically decide how
many should come in?
London needs to leave the UK.
This should be crystal clear to
anyone. A referendum should be
celebrated as soon as physically
possible. Some people argue that
London is too small to be able to
negotiate its own trade deals with
the rest of the UK and the world.
All those people should keep in
do we have to offer that another
women could not? Are we really
so special to believe 50% of the
population need our help?
But ‘help’ men do. If you’re
familiar with odd bits of Twitter, or
Orange Is The New Black, you might
have heard of Matt McGorry. He’s
the guy that plays that ‘nice’ prison
guard that sleeps with the inmates.
Yeah, that guy, he’s a #malefeminist.
Whether he’s posing with the
current great feminist work he’s
reading, or arguing with Piers
Morgan on Twitter, McGorry is
fighting the good fight. Although
for McGorry, that doesn’t always
include listening to women – he’s
well known for blocking women
that criticise his brand of feminism.
But, perhaps he knows best; after
all, he has read quite a few books.
So should men self identify as
feminist? More often than not,
however good your intentions, you
are likely to overstep your bounds
and hinder rather than help. And
this is because, however much you
read, men simply don’t have the
same lived experiences as women;
we don’t know what it’s like to go
out knowing that at some point you
will get groped,to be catcalled in the
street walking home in your school
uniform, to know that walking
home at night alone is dangerous
and that one women is killed in the
UK every three days by a current
or former partner, and to always be
told that you are exaggerating your
experience of sexism and that you’re
being hysterical.
The rest of
the UK is an
economic
mess, and
London
should stay
out of it
mind that London has had no
problem setting these deals since
the middle ages. Hell, even since
Roman times we have been able to
make our own terms with respect
to the world. The Queen still has
to ask for permission to come into
the City of London. Our greatness
is still there. We have been admired
and respected by countless empires.
In this fast moving, complex world,
we are still relevant enough to
negotiate our own trade deals with
the rest of the world.
Why should London, the most
prosperous region in the UK, have
to share this vast amount of wealth
creation with the rest of the UK?
How many millions of pounds are
we sending to the UK every day?
Why should we back infrastructure
projects in the north of England?
Why should we fund industrial
productioninWales?Whyshouldn't
London keep its wealth and spend
it in its own health service? The rest
of the UK is an economic mess,
and London should stay out of it
completely – for its greater good.
We must take back our democracy.
We must cease to be ruled by UK
bureaucrats. We must finally take
back control of our borders. A
referendum must be held, and we
should categorically, assertively and
with the pride of an admirable,2000
year old great city, must certainly
vote Leave. The fight for freedom
must go on until it is won, until our
city is free, happy and worthy of all
the Londoners who died defending
it.
(PS, in my next article, I'll talk
about Hammersmith introducing
an Australian star-point system for
immigration, so we can control our
border with Fulham. Oh, and I also
discuss the implications of Pluto
voting to leave the Solar System and
finally regaining its long-dreamed
independence.)

This leads to a problem though:
what should we be doing?
The first thing is listening to
women’s experiences, because we
simply don’t know. Then it’s using
the position we have in society to
enact change. Not by telling women
what they should and shouldn’t do,
but by talking to other men,from our
own experience. Because traditional
masculinity can be toxic, it places
unobtainable expectations on men,
and these have a negative impact
on everyone. Whether it’s men not
talking about their feelings because
it’s “feminine” (or worse – “gay”),
‘Lad culture’, or the fact that men
are more likely to commit suicide
than women, toxic masculinity is
destructive for both sexes, and it’s
all around us.
For me, Terry Crews, the former
NFL player and guy in Brooklyn
99, puts it best in his book on
masculinity. Crews says “My
message to all men is that you have
to kill pride, you’ve been taught that
pride is a manly thing, that pride
is a good thing. But the problem
with pride is that it stops you from
growth.” Caring about women’s
issues isn’t anti-male,women’s rights
are human rights and human rights
are women’s rights. But, if you’re
a man, before you decide to tell
women what they should be doing,
maybe consider what you should be
doing first.
