The Complex and Real parts of Love
Netflix’s new rom-com series does not disappoint
C
reated by Judd Apatow,
Paul Rust, and Lesley
Arfin, Love is simply
great. I really enjoyed
watching it; mostly for the fact
that it’s different from all the usual
rom-coms. It doesn’t have wishy-
washy clichés but rather it dives
into the complexities and realism of
relationships.
Typically, one would expect the
two main leads to get to know and
fall for each other.They’re supposed
to be the quintessential couple that
the audience roots for. However,
this is not that kind of show. In fact
in this show, I was rooting for the
two main characters not to find each
other and become a couple. Mickey
and Gus are terrible, not just for
each other, but also as people. They
have faults in completely different
and very real ways.
Gillian Jacobs portrays the
character Mickey, the manager of
a radio station, who appears to be
almost an extension of her character
from Community. She’s loud but
astute, and prone to impulsivity
based on little information.
However, she’s not the ‘crazy-girl’
archetype as we see; although we
do see how deep-rooted some of
her issues really are. Her story
prominently features her radio-
show boss, her quirky Australian
roommate and her ex.
On the other side we have Paul
Rust as Gus, someone who seems
the typical ‘nice-guy’ but turns out
to not be all that nice. He’s an on
set-tutor and wannabe writer on
the set of a supernatural series
called ‘Witchita’. He struggles with
trying to be taken more seriously
as well as dealing with precocious
but unhappy child actors. Later on,
an attractive actor on set warms to
him in a way Mickey is hesitant to,
which leads to troubles down the
line.
Stepping away from the main
stars, the ensemble cast are also
great. Sure, they give generic advice
now and then but they all feel like
real people who have their own
thing going. In particular, Mickey’s
roommate Bertie, played by Claudia
O’Doherty is charming. She could
have been nothing more than a
smiling joke but she’s able to really
shine in her role. A particularly
memorable episode is when Bertie
and Gus go on a date and are
manipulated by Mickey to compete
to be the worst date ever.
A very nice touch in this series
(also present in the equally great
Master of None) is the nature of the
episodes in general. Sure there is
an on-going story and a serialised
element, but all the episodes are,
to a degree, standalone and self-
contained. It’s a nice change of
pace from all the other shows we
spend our time binge-watching.
Each episode resolves around some
occasion or incident like a party, a
hang-out, or even just waiting for
a text message. In fact, you realise
the two leads don’t actually spend
a lot of time together on the show.
We mostly follow their separate
lives and problems; the two of them
trying to decide whether to actually
go for a relationship forms the glue
of the show.
When the show actually sends
Gus and Mickey on a date, we’ve
grown fairly used to seeing them
apart.It makes us see the differences
between the two, as well as their
issues and how it ultimately leads
to the interactions between the two.

This week on Games of Thrones
It’s season six, episode six!
T
his week’s episode came
with a lot of throwbacks
to characters of previous
seasons. Hope you’ve got
a good memory.
We open with a return to Meera
dragging Bran away from the
White Walkers (moment of silence
for Hodor) while Bran has frantic
visions, contrasting the Ice of the
White Walkers with the Fire of the
Mad King screaming “Burn them
all”. This gets derailed when some
bloke rides up on a horse looking
like one of the Nazgul from Lord of
the Rings (or my Skyrim character)
and takes out the Wights with a
fire mace. Pretty badass stuff in all
honesty. Later in the episode we
return to them and it is revealed
that the mysterious rider is in fact
Benjen! Remember? From five years
ago? I told you you’d need a good
memory.There’s a short explanation
of how this happened.He was about
to turn into a zombie before the
Children of the Forest stabbed him
in the heart, because it went so well
in the past.
Bit of a change of pace now as
we turn to Sam and Gilly heading
to his family home. Sam gives her
the cover story then drops the fact
that his dad would probably murder
her given the choice. She seems
surprisingly cool with that, then
you remember what her dad was
like and you understand why. The
meeting with the sister and mum
goes pretty well, lovely people, it’s
only at the family dinner when
things start to turn south. Randyll
Tarly really is a scary, scary man and
you can see the effect he still has
on Sam, beating him down to the
point where he can’t defend Gilly.
Eventually, Mama Tarly fires back
and leaves the table. Sam goes to
Gilly’s room to say goodbye before
deciding against it and taking her,
the baby and his father’s Valyrian
Steel sword with him. I can’t see
how he’s gonna spin this to fit in
with his Night’s Watch vows.
We finally have some development
with Arya’s story this week as she
gets to know her target, who is by
all accounts a great actor, and lovely
lady. You can tell the writers had
great fun writing the backstage
scenes between the actors, hopefully
all the sass and competitiveness (as
well as the hiring of hitmen) isn’t
quite accurate to the actors on the
show. The climax comes when Arya
decides not to kill the actress and
warn her about the understudy who
hired her. Confirming that Arya
will not become a Faceless Man.
She retrieves Needle from where
she stashed it and hides in a cave
in the dark, waiting for the Waif to
come and kill her. Now THAT is
how you quit a job!
Heading back to King’s Landing
and we see the Tyrell troops
heading to rescue Margaery after
a truly rousing speech from Mace
(brought a tear to my eye). A short
standoff between Jaime and the
High Sparrow Sanders ensues
before it is revealed that Tommen
has become a BernieBro and that
the huge gathered crowd will not,
in fact, get to see Natalie Dormer’s
boobs. Shockingly, this doesn’t lead
to a riot, instead leading to huge
cheers from the audience as Jaime
and Mace must stand down. Jaime
is then fired from his job as Lord
Commander of the Kingsguard
and told he is being sent to help the
Freys (Remember? From Season
three?) retake Riverrun. We are
then treated to a short scene of
Walder Frey having a go at his son
and sexually harassing his… wife?
Daughter? It’s hard to tell with this
show.
We finish with a Daenerys scene,
not anything substantial in a story
sense, just bringing up the fact that
she needs 1000 ships to transport
her army (conveniently the same
number that Euron said he was
bringing over) and hopping back
onto Drogon and giving another
badass speech, I imagine Daario’s
getting pretty sick of them by now. I
suppose the point of this scene is to
show both that Drogon has gotten
bloody massive and that Dany
finally has some control over him,
but honestly it felt pretty redundant.
The title of this episode, ‘Blood of
my Blood’, links into many of the
stories going on here, with many
of the younger characters ditching
their family ties for the relationships
they chose for themselves: Sam
leaves his family for Gilly, Tommen
leaves his family for Margaery and
the both of them leave their families
for the Church. This contrasts,
of course, with Arya leaving the
Faceless Men, becoming a Stark
again when she gets Needle back
and Bran reuniting with his Uncle.
All in all, not very eventful, but a
great breath of fresh air after last
week’s heartbreak.

Pretty
badass
stuff in all
honesty
Things go right, but things also
go wrong and this is a refreshing
change from all the typical romantic
stories we’ve seen or are accustomed
to. It’s not that the characters
aren’t seeking love, there’s just an
abundance of selfishness and self-
loathing to overcome on the journey.
An interesting aspect that’s
shown in the series is the current
generation’s fixation on text
messages, or just messages in
general. We see how big a part they
play in relationships, for better or
It dives
into the
complexities
and
realism of
relationships
for worse, and the problems people
face when they become too overly
reliant on, or analytical of texts.
Outside of the whole, ‘will they
won’t they’story, there are some nice
moments in-between. Mickey and a
friend take drugs and go on a wild
adventure on a subway. Similarly,
Gus meets up with his friends
regularly to make up theme songs
for movies which don’t have them.
There’s general comments about
Spaceballs, and Pretty Woman among
other movies and things. The world
feels filled-in and natural with lots
of little nuggets of enjoyment here
and there.
At the end of the day, Love is
very much its own thing and plays
with a lot of things that have little
to do with the title. It’s not that
love is something which can’t be
sought, but rather that there are a
lot of obstacles and issues that need
to be dealt with in the process. No
character is who you think they
are on first viewing and all the
performances are top-notch.
This might not be the kind of
show for people who don’t like
awkward situations. For everyone
else, this show is rewarding due to
its rejection of standard tropes, its
bluntness, as well as the fact that it’s
simply funny.
