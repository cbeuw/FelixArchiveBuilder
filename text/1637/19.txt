Let me eat cake
FELIX visits WA café, a Japanese pâtissierie in Ealing Broadway
M
arie Antoinette once
said, “Let them eat
cake.” If I were a
peasant back in the
days of the French Revolution, I’d
happily take her words as a genuine
attempt to offer me cake, ditch my
hunger for the stale baguettes and
munch on the amazing French
creations for the rest of my life,
maybe a vanilla millefeuille, a Saint
Honoré or a basket of madeleines.
Back to the 21st
century. Having
a natural sweet tooth, my love for
cake in particular has transformed
through the last 20 years of my
life to an almost uncontrollable
psychological problem – the one
and only symptom being that I
cannot stop thinking about it. I’d be
planning my next trip to Columbia
Road market to pick up one of Lily
Vanilli’s amazing tarte au citron on
my tube journey to college. I’d be
analysing the layers of contrasting
flavours and textures of a chocolate
gateâu during lectures. And at
the end of the day, putting all the
remaining cake-fueled brain power
to use in writing articles such as the
one you are reading right now.
On a particularly bad day, possibly
triggered by the high levels of stress,
cortisol and hypoglycemia, I’d
look at anyone blankly in the eye
muttering: “I want cake.” Luckily
for me the Library Café happens to
supply a good enough raspberry and
white chocolate muffin to keep me
sane.
On a good day, normally on
a weekend when I am actually
bothered to get out of my oversized,
worn out sweater and make myself
look slightly more presentable, I’d
head off to WA café, my favourite
place for all things cake, located just
a short walk from Ealing Broadway
tube station. Living in between
Holland Park and Shepherd’s Bush
means I’m conveniently five stops
away on the Central line as opposed
to the eleven stops on the District
line from South Kensington.
WA café, owned by a Japanese
pâtissier by the name Mayumi
Nakahara, is a small independent
café boasting a range of pastries
produced on-site by their skilled
pâtissiers every day. Their pastries
are strongly influenced by the
French, yet mixes this unique style,
great attention to detail and the
cuteness exclusive to the Japanese
people into their creations, making
them quintessentially Japanese.
After all the cakes I have ever
allowed into my mouth in London,
from the local Patisserie Valerie to
that posh, pink French patisserie
down Exhibition Road, WA café’s
are by far the best I can get without
a trip across the channel.
Walking in through the clean glass
automatic doors you are greeted by
their pristine creations of the day
all lined up in neat rows in the
glass display alongside other freshly
baked buns, croissants and biscuits.
The Japanese waitresses politely
nod and smile at your entrance,
waiting behind the counter quietly
as you devour the view in front of
your eyes with your back bent, while
eavesdropping on the local Japanese
lady next to you ordering in perfect
Japanese.
Their range of ten hardly ever
changes except for a few seasonal
additions, such as their cherry
blossom mousse cake during the
spring or the grapefruit pistachio
tart in the summer. Despite this,
I always spend an embarrassing
amount of time walking backwards
and forwards in front of the counter
just to make up my mind on what
to get. Don’t call me indecisive and
greedy – you too would be blinded
by the colour, the immaculate detail
and the beautiful smells drifting
from their ovens behind.
On my fourth visit, I decided
to treat myself to a proper eat-
in experience at their wooden
tables by the large window. While
waiting for my tea and cake, I
immersed myself into the peace,
tranquility and cosiness in the
atmosphere, generated by the bright
and simple interior. Their name,
WA, in Japanese, means peace and
harmony. Their choice of crockery
is the perfect reflection of the
Japanese people’s style, attention
to detail and respect for food. In
their culture, each bowl and dish on
the table should complement the
food and contribute to the overall
enjoyment of the dining experience.
Cakes are served on small, white,
rustic-looking ceramic plates and
tea in thick-bodied bowls on a black
saucer.

a warming cup of matcha latte, the
green tea version of your usual
coffee.Just something I always order
whereverpossibleasitremindsmeof
home.The strawberry shortcake, the
iconic representative of a Japanese
transformation of a Western classic,
is a heavenly ménage à trois between
the layers of sweet whipped cream,
light sponge and slices of the juiciest
strawberries.
My other three visits involved an
extended trial of their creations.
Their signature choux trios is a row
of three mini chou joined together,
sandwiching whipped cream
featuring three oriental flavours:
black sesame, matcha and azuki
(red bean) custard. The choux à la
crème is again an amazing, crusty
choux pastry filled with vanilla
custard. I was more than delighted
to find them still fresh and crunchy
after being in the fridge and taken
home – normally you’d expect shop-
bought choux to have absorbed all
that moisture in the air and had
shrunken to a sad, chewy blob.
The raspberry and pistachio tart
is a frangipane tart with a fragrant,
buttery crust with a lightly whipped
custard cream and embellished with
fresh raspberries and was another
one that succeeded in retaining that
crunch. Their matcha rolled cake, a
delicate sponge with lightly whipped
matcha cream and azuki paste, uses
top-quality matcha powder from
Kyoto, Japan to give that unique
scent and prominent bittersweet
flavour in every mouthful. A more
classic choice would be the Mont
Blanc, a whole candied chestnut
enrobed with sweet whipped cream
and covered with chestnut cream,
all balanced on a crumbly almond
frangipane tart. And finally, the
white sesame cheesecake with a
full-flavoured white sesame cream
cheese and a crumbly black sesame
biscuit base.
All this writing made me crave
their cakes again. Will I be back for
more? Most definitely.
