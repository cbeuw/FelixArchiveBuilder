Sweat over something more important
The union has more pressing priorities than air conditioning
Jonathon Masters
Writer
T
his quote struck me last
week: “air conditioning
must be the top priority
for sabbaticals”. This is
possibly one of the stupidest, most
ignorant statements ever committed
to this paper. Everybody knows
that the library is hot from floors
three upwards, and as a result a
petition has been signed by over
a thousand people in support of
air conditioning, but the idea of
spending £13.5 million on what is
essentially an unnecessary luxury
is ludicrous and the union is better
off concentrating on actual pressing
issues.
There is also a problem with the
way in which we have tried to go
about achieving this issue – at a
university with such consistently
low student satisfaction ratings,
what makes any of us think that
they would go out of their way to
view a petition that can be signed by
anybody on a website which, unlike
the tobacco industry, Imperial
College London has no links to.
One comment on the online
version of last week’s article also
addresses the fact that you can use
your own self-volition to write a
council paper and propose that the
union take a stance and petition
for this change rather than writing
a snotty article to indirectly accuse
the union of not doing enough to
represent the Imperial student body.
This mentality is one constantly
exhibited by Imperial students: they
are unhappy with the state of certain

things around campus but are either
too lazy or indifferent to actually
exact any change or do anything at
university that isn’t study or drink.
The principal problem with this
mentality is that frankly it’s just
selfish and ignorant: if the library is
too hot, revise somewhere else – you
can go to SAF, various engineering
departments’ study rooms, cafe’s,
your own room, or maybe, god
forbid, you could do something
other than study. It just seems so
selfish, childish, and naive to claim
that the priority of the organisation
that is meant to represent the
entirety of the Imperial student
population should not focus on
the crisis of housing, the increase
in tuition fees, the abysmal waiting
times for the imperial college health
centre, the low student satisfaction
that Imperial perpetually maintains,
or the lack of funding for 5th
and
6th
year medical students. Instead,
their priority should be on making
yourself more comfortable when
you do your work when there are
plenty of alternatives that don’t cost
£13.5 million.
Now, in the paraphrased words
of Aubrey Graham, "I took a break
from revision, now it’s back to that."
This is
possibly
one of the
stupidest,
most
ignorant
statements
ever
committed
to this paper

your chest?
