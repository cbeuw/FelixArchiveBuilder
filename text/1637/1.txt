Imperial staff pensions invested
in tobacco firms
• Cancer Research UK-funded
posts contribute to pension
that has £211 million in British
American Tobacco
• Most Imperial academics
contribute to this pension
A
fter FELIX’s scoop last
week on Imperial’s £2.4
million investment in
the tobacco industry,
the Guardian has revealed that a
university pensions provider has
£211 million invested in British
American Tobacco.
The Universities Superannuation
Scheme (USS) is the pension fund
for academic staff at Imperial,
including PhD students.
There are multiple PhD positions
funded by Cancer Research UK at
Imperial, and by extension, some
of that money is being invested by
USS into the tobacco industry.
As we reported last week, tobacco
firms are a pretty safe bet when
it comes to large institutional
investments, despite the fact that
the government has been clamping
downontheindustry–mostrecently
by introducing plain packaging in
the supposedly the ‘world’s ugliest
colour’ as well as graphic images of
the effects of smoking.
The USS’ fund was worth about
£49 billion last year, and the British
American Tobacco investment is
the company’s fifth biggest holding,
Imperial starts
joint venture
with Nestlé
coming after a £344 million
investment in Shell.
It's not just Imperial academics
signed up to this kind of pension
– upper levels of professional,
operational and technical service
workers at the college are also
contributing.
This is not just the case for staff at
Imperial – university workers across
the country found out this week that
their pensions’ fifth biggest holding
was in tobacco. Despite this news,
Universities UK, which represents
all of Britain’s Presidents and
Rectors said USS was “a responsible
and engaged investor”.
Cancer Research UK told
the Guardian that it was now
supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios
– an Australian company founded
by an oncologist that helps
companies divest their funds from
tobacco. Someone should probably
give the Imperial endowment board
their number.

mperial has signed a deal
with the food and drink giant
Nestlé to launch research into
nutrition together.
The research will focus specifically
on the gut’s bacterial make-up,
the microbiome, and digestive
metabolites’ influence on both
physical and mental health.
Nestlé will invest £6.5 million in
the clinical and pre-clinical studies
over a five year period.
Imperial has been collaborating
on research with the Swiss firm for
the last decade,but this semi-formal
Memorandum of Understanding
commits the food and beverage
multinational to provide funding
for joint studies.
Nestlé’s Chief Technology Officer
called Imperial “a great fit for
Nestlé”, whilst Imperial President
Alice Gast said the college will
work with the world’s largest food
company to “address pressing
societal challenges like diabetes and
obesity”.
Nestléhasbeenatargetforboycotts
since the 1970s over its practices
surrounding advertising baby
formula to women in developing
countries. The corporation was
accused of getting babies hooked
on the expensive, and unnecessary
formula and misleading mothers by
dressing salespeople as nurses. This
resulted in a decade long boycott
and a change in marketing rules.
Recently, the company has been
accused of ducking rules again, and
reports from Save the Children as
recently as 2013 have criticised the
firm for its advertising.
In 2010 Greenpeace went after
the company for its sources of palm
oil – its supplier was accused of
illegal deforestation...
