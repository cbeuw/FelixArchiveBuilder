Why I'm betting on £500 on Donald to win
Hillary's campaign isn't enough to save us from The Trump
Jack Foxabbott
Writer
L
ast week I bet £500 at 2:1
that the next American
president will be Donald
Trump. And if Hillary
Clinton doesn’t sort out her
campaign strategy fast, he will win
a landslide victory.
When Trump initially announced
his campaign, he was a joke
candidate – how could he, a man
who had previously claimed to be
a Democrat, have a hope of getting
the Republican nomination?
Once in the race, his objective
was to obtain attention quickly,
which he achieved with an array
of insulting statements and ‘bold’
policies. Of Mexican immigrants,
he said; “They’re bringing drugs,
crime. They’re rapists.” He pledged
to build a wall along the southern
border and to “make Mexico pay for
it”, and he called for a shutdown on
Muslim immigration.
All of this is preposterous, there’s
no doubt. But that didn’t matter.
At this stage he wasn’t trying to be
electable, he was merely trying to
get noticed- and noticed he got. In
the following months he received
over $2billion worth of free media
attention. When his ratings went
up, he used this attention to let
everybody know. And somehow
it got better for Trump – people
actually bought into his ideas. With
every controversial statement he
made, thousands praised him for
speaking his mind, for challenging
political correctness. The American
right-wing was more stupid than
anyone thought.
He had everything he needed:
huge attention and huge popularity.
It seemed only a matter of time until
the nomination was secured. People
tuned in to the debates purely to
watch him – he became the man
who stood up for the silent majority.
He had convinced millions that
they wanted America to be great
again, whatever that means.
His story couldn’t be more
different from that of career
politician Clinton. At the start of
the Democratic race, it was pretty
much assumed that she would win.
Her leading opposition was
hardcore leftie Bernie Sanders,
a candidate who was initially
dismissed as being unelectable on
account of his socialist policies. His
campaign is largely about getting
big money out of politics, and
emphasising the need for a non-
establishment president. Along with
Trump,he has made the presidential
election all about fighting the status
quo.
Clinton’s reaction has been
peculiar. Instead of emphasising the
need for someone with experience
and knowledge rather than an
outsider, she decided to desperately
insist that she’s not part of the
establishment. Her reason? She’s a
woman! She is trusted by neither
the left nor the right.The left thinks
she’s controlled by the big banks
and corporations who funded her
campaign and career, the right
thinks she’s responsible for the
Benghazi attacks and would never
vote for her because of her liberal
stances on issues like abortion.
She’s been associated with
scandal and corruption her whole
political life, including her private
email account currently under
Who are we to vote on EU membership?
To be honest, we don't really know what we're talking about
Desmond Cheung
Writer
A
s the date of the EU
referendum approaches,
we are being flooded
with Remain vs Exit
articles on all media. However,
this is NOT going to be another
advocating piece. In fact, I am
wondering why one even gets to
vote on such an issue at all.
Before you label me an
authoritarian-totalitarian-fascist
and rush to attack me in the
comments section or dismiss this
article altogether, let me explain
why I think the idea of referendums
contradict the fundamentals of a
democratic process and effective
governance.
First, let's all take a step back and
ask ourselves: do we actually know
enough? I am not trying to belittle
your intelligence, but we are talking
about conducting an analysis of the
EU, which comprises 28 countries,
forming the biggest economy in the
world (nominally). This is serious.
Consider a crude analogy: would
you want an airbus to be designed
by the population? Again, before
you rush to the comment section
and cleverly point out the numerous
differences, the analogy serves to
demonstrate that they both involve
highly complicated and delicate
evaluations, which lead to long
term and lasting consequences.
In fact, I would further argue that
deciding whether a (your) nation
should remain in a political union
is far more difficult; there is no
“analytical solution”, hell, not even
a numerical one through some
Runge Kutta method. Even if you
personally possess a cutting edge
insight regarding the matter and
accurately predict what the future
holds, what percentage of the
population can do that? Far too
often, opinions are being swayed
by three minute Youtube videos
or a ten minute read of an article
written by an obviously biased (The
Economist ahem) source. These
forms of media provide little to no
genuine contribution to solving any
problems. The bottom line is that
people who spend YEARS studying
economics can barely understand
what is going on, so how can we
have possibly have figured it out?
At this point, the reader might
rightly ask“If the general population
is incapable of making difficult
and well informed choices, what
is the point of an election? After
all, the population is selecting the
person who will lead their country."
Here, I argue that the election of a
person is of a very different nature
to a referendum on an issue. Sure,
candidates have campaign policies
and parties are biased towards
certain ideologies, but an election
makes things personal. Ultimately,
the choice is based on our evaluation
of the person, which I believe the
population is far more capable of
than non-linear political-economic
analysis. It does not matter what
academic knowledge you hold,
nor whether you went to Harvard.
Through daily interactions with
our family, friends and enemies,
our abilities to evaluate people have
been developing from the day we
were born. An election is a process
in which the candidate undergoes
public evaluation, the ultimate test
of a candidate’s character. Sure, we
might make mistakes sometimes,
such as trusting the cheating piece-
of-shit partner we loved; but there
is currently no better way for us to
pick someone to lead.
Moving onto the more general
problem I see here, I find the idea
of entrusting difficult and complex
issues to the public ridiculous,
and it goes against everything I
believe a democratic and effective
governance should be. My idea of
a functional system is one in which
the population elects leaders with
clear, strong and decisive standards.
In return, the chosen ones should
lead decisively (with checks and
balances, of course). If Cameron
believes that Remain is the way
to go, he should have campaigned
for Remain during the election;
if the UK thinks he’s nuts, he's
out of 10 Downing Street. Do we
want to descend into an unhealthy
and unproductive spiral, where all
parties go for saying “we will let
you decide later”? What they are
essentially saying is “Whatever you
investigation by the FBI, with
30,000 ‘accidentally’ deleted emails
presumed to have contained
information about the Benghazi
attacks. Trump is already referring
to her as "Crooked Hillary”, and
will push this until November.
It’s clear that she knows more
about almost every issue that could
come up. However, in the debates,
he will crush her. Trump has shown
that to win a debate you don’t need
to know anything about anything as
long as you can talk.
He will move categorically to the
left in order to pick up votes from
the currently undecided. Already
we have seen him abandon his
destructive foreign policy, saying in
April that “the power of weaponry
is the single biggest problem in
the world”. This will be effective
because his Republican fans on the
whole don’t care about policy – as
long as he remains The Donald he’ll
have their undying support.
His early campaign was very
insulting to Mexicans and Muslims
who had little impact in the
Republican primaries. In May he
acknowledged that his numbers
among Hispanics were a big
problem, but said “I have two more
people [Rubio and Cruz] to get rid
of...once I start on Hillary you’ll see
those numbers change.” This shows
that he will dramatically change
his rhetoric now that he’s won the

decide,if you f*ck up,don’t blame us,
we gave you the choice.” Instead of
shoving the decision back into the
hands of the public,those governing
should conduct the analysis with
all the talent they can find, subject
to the population’s query and
opinion,come to a decision and take
responsibility for the outcome.
Do not,for a moment,think that I
am (or let people say you are) being
a coward for not wanting to make
the choice. We should be afraid of
what the outcome will be given the
magnitude of the problem. We, 'the
people', are powerful because we
decide who will come to power, and
not because we get to decide upon
things that most of us can’t even
begin to comprehend. Certainly,
I might be overly ideological,
unrealistic and have overlooked
some seriously obviously stuff.
Coming back to the real world,
where we are being presented with
such a referendum, we are aware of
the existence of complete lunatics
and we are facing a choice, we
should do our best to comprehend
and vote for what we believe in at
the moment – I just don’t think this
to be the way to go.
Looking across the pond, god
knows how much I despise and hate
Donald, but at least he is confident
enough in his (possibly delusional)
supporters to not hold a referendum
on building the Mexican wall.
To clarify, I
think Trump
is abhorrent
Republican vote.
The way the two presumptive
candidates are already running their
respective presidential campaigns
is very telling. Trump wants to
Make America Great Again while
Hillary wants to be the first female
president. To the uninformed
voter I know which one of those
sounds more appealing. She will
resort to project fear. Already on
her website the first thing that
pops up is “We can’t risk a Donald
Trump presidency”. Her campaign
will be entirely anti-Trump, and as
dangerous as a Trump presidency
would be,negative politics will never
resonate as well as Trump’s Make
America Great Again philosophy
has, especially given how bad a
communicator Clinton is.
To clarify, I think Trump is
abhorrent. He’s the least prepared
presidential candidate of all time
and would be the worst thing to
ever happen to America. If I could,
I would vote against him. He is
marmite, and I concede that not
a tonne of Americans are fans of
marmite. But Hillary is out-of-date
marmite. Americans have shown
that to them, policy just doesn’t
matter as much as personality,
and unless Clinton makes radical
changes to her campaign strategy,
she’ll make this a race between
Trump and please-God-not-Trump.
It’ll be all about The Donald.
