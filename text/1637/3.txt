Imperial to offer women’s only MBA scholarships
Female students could get £25,000 off their fees
I
mperial’s Business School
has teamed up with the Forté
Foundation to introduce
several women-only
scholarships worth £25,000 for its
Masters of Business Administration
(MBA) programme.
However, this scholarship will
only cover just over half of the
whopping £45,000 fee Imperial
charge for its full time course.
Women chosen to be “Forté
Fellows”would also get access to the
foundation’s women in leadership
conference, as well multiple
opportunities to network with
employers and other fellows around
the world.
This scholarship collaboration
between the Business School
and the Forté Foundation is part
of Imperial’s new sponsorship
arrangement with the non-profit.

Academics from the School of Public Health say voting Remain is the “logical” option
P
rofessors and readers in
public health at Imperial
have published a letter in
this month’s Journal of
the Royal Society of Medicine on
how staying in the EU would help
safeguard the health of British
people.
The letter, signed by 17 academics,
points to the economic downturn
predicted by the Treasury should
we leave the EU, and the potential
government spending slash as a
result. The public health experts
say that this would mean either
huge cuts in the NHS budget or
the imposition of American-style
health insurance.
All women applying to the MBA
programme will be considered
for the scholarship. Imperial say
they’re looking for candidates
with commitment to Forté’s
mission of launching women into
positions of leadership, as well
Imperial professors warn against Brexit
The letter also warned that
our heavy reliance on healthcare
professionals from Europe (we
currently employ about 29,000 in
the NHS) would mean Brexit could
leave us short-staffed, and endanger
future recruitment efforts to fill in
gaps in the workforce.
The letter goes on to say that
healthcare for Brits living in or
travelling around Europe would be
unclear were we to leave the EU,
and warned again of the prospect
of health insurance fees where there
currently are none.
FELIX reported last week that
Imperial receives 20% of its research
funding from EU sources, and
the letter backed this up, saying
that the EU’s current policy of
free movement of people between
member states allowed for the best
scientists come together to do better
research, which in turn allows for
British institutions to climb the
various world university rankings.
The letter also praised Erasmus,
and warned that the government’s
university budgets would likely be
slashed if we left the EU.
The editorial emphasised the
collaboration between universities
and how leaving the EU could
endanger public health. Towards
the end, the letter got a little more
political, stating that the road of
negotiation that would come post-
Brexit would be long and arduous
and could risk a renewed effort by
Scottish nationalists to leave the
UK.

as a strong academic record and
a “demonstrable track record of
leadership in in your field”.

school students, including the
Imperial Women’s Scholarship,
which offers £15,000 to female
students whose applications are
particularly strong. Ex-Imperials
students get a cheeky 20% off an
MBA too, in what the college
liberally describes as an “Imperial
loyalty bursary”.
In 2015, the Business School
had 1446 students enrolled on its
courses, and its full-time MBA
was ranked 4th
in Europe by the
Financial Times this year.
Alice Gast sent an email out to
all students and staff reminding
them of Imperial’s work backing
Remain. Last week, an email was
sent out to students and staff in the
materials department, on behalf of
the Students for Remain campaign
group. However, the materials
department said that they would
send out a similar email on behalf of
the opposition group if anyone from
the campaign team got in touch.
