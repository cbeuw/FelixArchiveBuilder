This is not the first pensions
controversy to have hit the college
in the last few months. In late
March, staff were notified that from
April onwards, their pay packets
would be getting double hit of
increased National Insurance and
pension contribution. Those on the
USS pension scheme (as opposed to
the SAUL scheme) would be taking
home between 0.5% to 1.5% less.
The combination of USS pension
and NI changes meant all staff took
a 0.7% to 2.7% pay cut.
The college was also forced to
contribute more to both pension
funds, including a 2% increase in its
payment into the USS scheme.

has positioned itself with a unique
offering to several life sciences-
based industries and we are pleased
to note the acquisition by Evonik.”
Evonik Industries have been
splashing the cash over the past
couple of months, purchasing a
division within Air Products and
Chemicals inc. for a cool $3.8
billion. The purchase of Alkion was
for an undisclosed fee.

...and peatland clearance. In 2012
the company was accused of “failing”
on its own child labour codes by an
independent labour auditor, which
mapped the supply chain from the
company’s cocoa resources in the
Ivory Coast.
The company also bought the
rights to a new experimental cow’s
milk allergy test for babies. The
€10 million purchase is part of a
move by the company into medical
sciences, which, along with the
Imperial deal, could see Nestlé
adding pharmaceuticals to its long
list of food products.
Definitely an on-brand partner for Imperial. Photo Credit: Metro
