This week you've finally had
enough of the bell ringing
at Queens Tower and snap.
They really need to set up
camp(anology) elsewhere
during revision.

This week,you’re the cigarette
on Queen’s Lawn that
replaced Queen’s Tower last
week in honour of Imperial’s
undying dedication to
supporting the tobacco
industry. Your smokey ashes
warm the cool caverns in
the space where endowment
board members should have
hearts.
This week, you use copies
FELIX to light a small fire
in your living room to keep
warm. Unfortunately, due to
its leaflet-like thinness this
particular week,and therefore
increased amount of sass
per page2
, the fire begins
shooting hot takes across the
room into people’s eyes, ears
and the general zeitgeist.
This week, you’re Queen’s
Tower. BONG BONG
BONG BONG, you cry, as
everyone tries to revise in the
library. Everyone looks up at
you, mumbling their disdain.
You just want to be loved,
and not have Big Band inside
you once a year.
This week, despite investing
millions of pounds in the
tobacco industry, you force
the poor old students’ union
to stop selling cigs at the
union shop, despite that the
fact that they are our one vice
in this soul-crushing, hideous
campus of overheated
libraries and exams with the
answers printed on the back.
This week, you’re
mansplaining feminism to
a woke woman of colour.
"Well actually, I think you’ll
find that #notallmen hate
women", you say, as you
accidentally smash the glass
ceiling above her head with
your colossal ability to miss
the fucking point.
This week you're Donald
Trump and after your ringing
endorsement from Dale
Winton last week, you get
one this week from a North
Korean propaganda website.
Deeply secretive and with a
questionable human rights
record, Dale was the host of
Supermarket Sweep.
This week you decide to
VOTE LEAVE in order to
deport your Swiss housemate
who always steals your milk.
Unfortunately Switzerland
aren't part of the EU anyway.
Bummer.
This week, you try and scale
the front of Beit, to hang
an EU flag off the disused
flagpole. Unfortunately, you
hang the flag upside down,
and 600 Germans assemble
in the quad thinking the
European Economic Area is
in distress. It is.
This week, you’re the
ICSM, and decide to start
monitoring all the free iPads
you gave out to students. To
your surprise, you don’t find
gigabytes of porn, but instead
discover hundreds of hours
of Angry Birds progress, the
deletion of which starts a
new junior doctors strike.
This week, you’re the air
conditioning units the
library so desperately
needs. However, a student
so adamant that the union
should be concentrating on
other things takes a baseball
bat to you, whilst exclaiming:
" A F F O R D A B L E
ACCOMMODATION IS
MORE IMPORTANT”.
This week, you’re your mom.
You should call her. Go on.
