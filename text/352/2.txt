LETTER TO M.P.
Sir,
This is a copy of a
letter that I have sent to
my local M P with res-
pect to the Rent Strike.
I believe that this line of
approach is more direct
than any line through the
college authorities, and,
if more people follow
this action through their
own local M.Ps. then the
rent strike action will
have some significance
in the circles where such
significance is more im-
portant, that is in West-
minster.
Dear Mr. Luce,
I am writing to you to
inform you that the
Union has set up mach-
inery for a rent strike in
the college and I am sup-
porting this action. We
believe that the present
grants- system contains
considerable anomalies
and our action aims to
draw attention to these
and is in no way aimed
to disrupt the running of
the college. When our
point is made all the
money will foe returend
to the college.
The anomalies are
briefly the wholly inade-
quate award given to
postgraduate students,
considering their contri-
bution to the technolog-
ical advancement of the
country they are pitifully
rewarded ifor the long
hours they work. Sec-
ondly, - married women
students face consider-
able hardship because
their husbands are usu-
ally also students and
yet they receive little
over half the normal
grant. Another group of
students, or should I say
potential students, can
never hope to receive
the degree they may de-
serve because of the
total lack of finance at
colleges of further edu-
cation and polytechnics.
Lastly, students relying
on parental contributions
rarely see the full sub-
sidy. I recommend the
abolition of the means
test to be financed by a
higher surtax.
In spite of the letter
heading, my home is in
Littlehampton, in your
constituency.
Yours sincerely,
Rupert Harper

THANK YOU
Sir,
Please forgive me for
the long delay in writing
to thank all those who
contributed to my won-
derful leaving present.
The hostess wagon is a
great success; Pat and I
don't know how we ex-
isted without it. Thank
you very much.
The only snag in
being retired is loss of
touch with so many
friends in the College.
With all good wishes
for Christmas and for
1974.
Yours sincerely,
John George
NUPE ATTACKS
RECTC I
Sir,
Many of you will have
read the letter signed by
the Rector, Sir Brian
Flowers, in the last issue
of Felix. Although it was
writen to • IC A S T M S ,
in my opinion it con-
cerns all Trade Unions
in Imperial College.
Sir Brian has instruc-
ted College officers not
to reply to communica-
tions couched in intem-
perate language. How
does one interpret this?
Surely what is accept-
able to some is objec-
tionable to Others. To
What extent will Sir
Brian's instructions be
abused by some College
officers? W i l l Trade
Union officers also de-
cide to find certain let-
ters from the manage-
ment objectionable and
decline to reply? Could
we not be faced with a
total breakdown in com-
munications between
College officers a n d
Union officials? What
will be the reactions of
the rank and file Union
membership if this kind
of situation does occur?
All these questions have
to foe answered. Sir
Brian states that the Col-
lege does not show fav-
our to certain sections of
the staff; this statement
is incorrect. IC NUPE
members have for a long
time complained that the
College treats them as
second class citizens.
These complaints are not
without foundation. Will
Sir Brian explain why we
lag foehind other mem-
bers of staff in holiday
and sick benefit entitle-
ments? Sir Brian states
that he would be reluc-
tant to believe that the
A S T M S membership
subscribes to the meth-
ods used by its officers.
In my experience of my
own Branch, it is the
rank and file 'member-
ship who make the deci-
sions; the Union officials
carry out the instructions
of its members. To what
extent we owe loyalty to
the College depends on
the treatment we receive
from the college. I be-
lieve IC NUPE has
reached a stage of rea-
sonable relationship with
the Personnel Depart-
ment. In my opinion Sir
Brian's letter could des-
troy this.

DEMONSTRATING
Sir,
I am pleased to inform
you that the Pay Board
has approved the Col-
lege's application for an
increase in the rate of
pay to part-time Student
Demonstrators to £1.15
per hour With effect from
7th November 1973.
This is the maximum in-
crease payable under
Phase 3 of the Govern-
ment's Counter-Inflation
Policy.
I have today written
to all Heads of Depart-
ments informing them of
the revised rate and of
the effective date of im-
plementation. I should
be very grateful if you
would let your col
leagues know of 'this
change. In the meantime
I am sending Mr. Bowl-
ing, the Chairman of the
Metallurgy and Mater
ials Science Postgradu
ate Group, a copy of this
letter in view of his ear-
lier correspondence with
the Rector.
Yours sincerely,
M. J. Davies
College Secretary

G. IF. Claringbull,
Director
PUBLICITY OFFICER
Sir,
With reference to Mr.
Sayles' suggestion in
the last issue of Felix,
that a Publications Offi-
cer be elected "whose
job would foe to deal
With the Whole realm of
publications o f t h e
Union":
(1) Would he elucid-
ate on the meaning of
"to deal with" in this
context,
(2) Should such an
officer be appointed
would steps foe taken to
safeguard the editorial
independence of the
different Union publica-
tions,
(3) Will he confirm
that any such decision
by I.C. Union would in
no way affect the func-
tioning of the publica-
tions of the Constituent
College Unions ?
Yours,
A. W. Jones
(New) Editor R.C.S.
Broadsheet
Dear Mr. Jones,
In reply to your ques-
tions :
1. The Publications Offi-
cer's job will be to co-
ordinate the work of the
various news organs
within IC. He will be ex-
pected to be " i n the
know" about everything
which is happening with-
in the Union. People
who publish other indi-
vidual news letters, etc.,
will be able to draw on
the Publications Officer's
knowledge to help with
producing information
for their newsletters.
2. Every Union publica-
tion Would still have its
own committee, and
thus would maintain its
own independence as far
as production and con-
tent. However, I feel
that they would be fool-
ish if they did not utilise
the Publications Officer's
information.
3. Once again, the C C U
publications will not be
affected in any way by
the appointment of the
Publications Officer, al-
though I would hope
they would draw upon
his help and assistance.
If you would like any
further clarification of
these answers, or have
any comments on this
appointment, I would be
very pleased to discuss
the matter.
Yours,
Norm
Last year Room at the
Top (RATT) was opened
to provide a number of
facilities for students :
Insurance, Travel, Car-
eers, Cheap Records,
Ents, and Welfare. As a
part of the "Welfare",
the Student Counsellor
accepted an invitation to
spend a couple of lunch-
times a week in RATT.
Don Adlington, above,
t h e present Student
Counsellor, now that he
is "full-time", feels that
he would like to con-
tinue this scheme.
ADVICE INDEX
The thinking foehind
this is that Don Adling-
ton, Who usually spends
most of his time seeing
students in his office in
Princes Gardens, may
well foe able to offer use-
ful information and ad-
vice on an informal basis
in RATT, possibly on
subjects which students
might not normally think
to see him about. For
example matters con-
cerning Social Security
and the Social Services
generally: legal difficul-
ties; special accommod-
ation or financial prob-
lems. In conjunction
with this, and to provide
as comprehensive a faci-
lity as possible, a self-
help index of agencies
and organisations cap-
able of supplying de-
tailed advice and infor-
mation on any welfar*
topic is being prepared.
When finished, this dir-
ectory will always foe
available for consulta-
tion in the RATT.
LUNCHT1MES
Don Adlington has
agreed to foe in RATT
from 1.00 to 2.00 p.m.
on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days. On Monday and
Wednesday lunchtimes
at the same time, Dave
Ashfoy, the union welfar*
officer, will man the
Welfare Corner in RATT.
The Welfare Corner is
the far-left corner as on*
enters RATT. The whole
scheme relies, however,
on the participation of
students. Even if yo«
don't have any prob-
lems, please come alonf
for a chat and tell either
of us What you think can
be done to improve rfo«
facilities.
