ACGI UNDER ATTACK
Of great relevance
to Guildsmen, but also
to other members of
Imperial College, past,
present and future is
the debate now being
held over (the status of
the Associateship of
^he City and Guilds In-
stitute. (A.C.G.I. —
Guilds Graduates for
the use of. Preferably
after your name).
Original Structure
Originally, in better
days when the world
was young, polys were
parrots, and I.C. was a
degree of silence, then
one educated one's
best engineers at the
City and Guilds College
(at ieaslt that hasn't
changed). This estab-
lishment was governed
by the Board of Dele-
gacy, whose members
oome from College, the
Clothworkers and Gold-
smiths Companies and
the City and Guilds In-
stitute. This board or-
ganised the financing
and structuring of the
courses, and they even-
tually recommended
the awarding of the
A.C.G.Is. to the stud-
ents as they passed out
(Which happened quite
regularly).
Univ. of London
•In joining I.C. and
later the University of
London the administra-
tion of Guilds became
the duty of the Rector
and Company. How-
ever the delegacy con-
tinued to operate, vet-
ting the courses and
accounts but they had
lost power to make de-
cisions other than the
annual recommendation
to award A.C.G.Is. It
was therefore the vic-
tim of a rationalisation
— and has been sus-
pended.
Instead of it recom-
mending to the Insti-
tute the awarding of
A.C.G.Is., a list would
periodically arrive, on
the City and Guilds In-
stitute doorstep, of the
latest Guilds Gradu-
ates.
Not Known
Now, obviously for
a body dedicated to
the maintenance and
improvement of the
Professional Engineer-
ing Standards, a situa-
tion whereby it is
awarding certificates to
a group of people who
it knows nothing about
is intolerable. A n d
quite rightly they have
enquired a b o u t a
change in this system.
Guildsmen
Now I personally re-
gard my A.C.G.I, as
being of at least equal
value to my BSc(Eng)
(both of which are
being kept safe for me
until I graduate, cross
of fingers X ) . It marks
a Guildsman out from
the run of the mill ord-
inary Engineering Gra-
duates. I personally
would welcome a par-
ticipation in the struc-
turing and examining
of my engineering de-
gree by the C. & G.I.
and/or any other pro-
fessional institution.
Sir Brian
However, I am wor-
ried, our present Glor-
ious Leader, Sir Brian
Flowers, is a bit good
at rationalising (so I
hear), and one thing
which initially looks as
if 'it needs rationalising
is the Constituted Col-
lege System. I person-
ally do not want to have
an A.I.C. (a la D.I.C.)
and I trust that you feel
the same.
R. L. Lolley
(Mech Eng III)
(Above may be chrono-
logically and factually
incorrect but the gen-
eral situation is as
above).
The president, Nor-
man Sayles, has receiv-
ed the following from
Hie College authorities:
Dear President,
You will be aware of
the recent damage to
the Union lift. Mr.
Shurety's memo to me
(see later) gives a few
details of this incident
and of damage sustain-
ed by the lifts in South-
side.
It is, of course, almost
impossible to find out
who is responsible in a
College of this size but
I do think it is most
important to warn peo-
ple, as widely as pos-
LIFTS
sible, of the dangers to
life and limb to which
actions give rise.
Where safety devices
are by-passed (as in
Princes Gardens) any
maintenance man who
may be working in the
shaft could be killed or
seriously injured, either
by the car or balance
weights. Again if a
landing door is opened
Whilst the lift is else-
where in the shaft, it is
very easy for somebody
to fall into the shaft.
One or two fatalities a
year happen in the
country due to this and
that is why only lift
engineers are permitted
to open landing doors.
Copies of Shurety's
note, together with cop-
ies of our normal lift
procedure, are presented
here. If you would in-
form your colleagues
and see that the widest
possible circulation is
given to this, I should
be most grateful. I will
see that the academic
staff and administration
(messengers, Cleaners,
etc.) are similarly in-
formed.
Yours sincerely,
E. A. Whitehead,
Chief Maintenance
Officer.
Mr. Whitehead,
For your information
1 write regarding the bad
treatment and ma!-
operation suffered by
our lift installations, par-
ticularly in areas with a
majority student popula-
tion.
Recent Incidents
(a) In one lift, a
panel was removed
wiring changed to
alter destination
point from that in-
dicated on panel.
Corrected by Otis'.
(p) The car floor selec-
tor panel removed
completely by per-
sons unknown.
The lift is out of ac
tion until another
panel is manufac-
tured. The President
of the Union has
been informed and
asked to co-operate
in finding the guilty
party.
East End Princes Gar-
dens Hall of Residence
(a) No. 4 lift car door
completely wrench-
ed off on 18th Octo-
ber, 1973 resulting
in extensive repairs
by 'Otis'.
The lift was out of
action for 4 weeks.
(b) No. 3 lift- car door
was forced open
with lift in motion,
as a result the car
door skate lever was
bent.
The lift was then
moved in the shaft
either by: winding—
brake release or
manual operation of
controller contrac-
tors, this action
caused each landing-
lock to be smashed
by the bent lever as
it passed.
The lift was out of
action and under re-
pair for 2 days.
These are just a few
of the many incidents
Which constantly occur,
some of the Wardens
are becoming very con-
scious of these happen-
ings and doing all in
their power to help re-
solve the problem.
P. G. Shurety.
CHEAP BRITISH RAIL
As a lot of you will
know by now, a scheme
has b e e n arranged
whereby it is possible to
obtain cheap British Rail
travel.
Full - time students
aged 18-27 can now
travel on most British
Rail services for about
half the normal fare.
The 50% concession is
on second class journeys
between a I
I
I British Rail
stations, but under the
scheme there is a mini-
mum student fare of 50p
single and £1.00 return.
Students are eligible for
reductions of up to 25%
on some Sealink ferry
services.
The student reduction
scheme is the result of
nine months of negotia-
tions between NUS Tra-
vel and British Rail and
is being introduced for
an experimental s i x
month period from Jan-
uary 1, 1974.
Rail Card
Students qualify for
the half-price fare by
purchasing a special
Student Rail Card from
NUS Travel offices (in-
cluding the Room at the
Top), for £1.50 plus 15p
VAT, total price £1.65.
Proof of full-time stud-
ent status and a pass-
port photograph must
also be produced. The
card is in its own plastic
wallet, together with a
pad of ticket request
forms. To claim the 50%
reduction, students hand
over a completed request
form and show the Stu-
dent Rail Card to the
booking clerk when they
buy their ticket at a Bri-
tish flail station in the
normal way.
Eligibility
The new scheme is
restricted to full-time
college students aged
18-27 inclusive — and
excludes students under
18, school students over
18, part-time students,
student nurses and for-
eign students visiting
the U K on holiday.
In his letter to British
R a i I accepting t h e
scheme, N U S Travel's
Marketing Manager, Paul
Connellan, voiced his
dissatisfaction w i t h
these eligibility restric-
tion's.
"Although we a r e
pleased to see the
sCheme finally in opera-
tion", the wrote, "we
have very serious reser-
vations both about the
age restrictions, upper
and tower, and the ex-
clusion of s t u d e n t
nurses and we will be
writing to you further on
this matter when our
Board have had a chance
to give a considered
reply. At this stage, I
would only add that I
think you are making a
great deal of extra prob-
lems for yourselves in
incurring the wrath of so
many students".
Protest
An immediate protest
against the principle of
cheaper rail fares for
students came from Mr.
John Stokes, Conserva-
tive M.P. for Oldbury
and Halesowen. He said:
"I think that it is absurd
that students belong to a
union at all. They are not
employees which is the
point of unions. They
are absurdly pretentious,
pompous, tiresome and
totally unrepresentative
of the majority of stu-
dents — they tend to
attract the activists!"
Restrictions
Certain specific trains
are excluded from the
half-price student fare
scheme. These include
commuter services to
and from London, some
Inter-City services (main-
ly those which would
normally be full, i.e.
rush-hour, main week-
end outgoings and re-
turns), and trains from
Scotland on various holi-
day dates. Full details of
all trains on which the
Student Rail Card can-
not be used are attached
to the pad of ticket re-
quest forms which is
issued with the card.
Further details of the
restrictions can be ob-
tained from the Room at
the Top where the NUS
Travel Service man a
counter between 10.00
and 15.00, Mondays to
Fridays.
Printed here is a
photo from the Felix
files. Choose your man
and "Fill the bubble".
Entries must reach
me by Monday, 29th
January at 5.00 p.m.
Place your entry in a
sealed envelope and
mark it "Fill the bub-
ble" and deliver it to
the Union office in the
Union-archway. There
is an entry fee of a
measly 10p and the
winner will take 50%,
the rest going to Rag.
This is an ideal wav
to make money both
for yourself and for
Rag.
Note:—50 entries
— £ 2 . 5 0 , 500 entries
— £ 2 5 . The entries
will be judged by the
Union Clerk, the Edi-
tor and Dr. Weale,
Union Treasurer, and
the results published
in the next edition,
due out on February
5th. Incidentally,
there are no prizes for
guessing the name of
the speaker.
Due to lack of space the breakdown procedure has had to
be postponed till next FELIX.
