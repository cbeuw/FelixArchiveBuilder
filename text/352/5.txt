CLUB SETS NEW RECORD
With the race scheduled to start at 3.00 p.m.
we rolled into Hayes at fifteen minutes to, on a
sparkling specimen from the Green Line pre-war
specials after the driver had stopped en route
to make a phone call. Not having a clue where to
go, the coin landed on tails so we headed in a
south-westerly direction until we stumbled on a
road mentioned in the instructions. On arriving
at the Met. Police sports centre, we discovered
that our opponents had not decided to run against
themselves, and the race was delayed until 3.30.
However, this was all part of the plot. Never trust
a policeman. Even Granny's computerised
"brain?" failed to decipher the craftily worded
route, known only to the opposition. The situa-
tion was not helped by the fact that a kiddies'
race on the same afternoon, crossed our route
in various places. This too, was marked by blue
flags, which could account for the appearance
of 4 IC runners aimlessly pounding the beat
down Hayes high street and arriving at the finish
ten minutes after all the others, and from the
other direction. However, this was Pad's day. He
was not one of the four, which gave him his best
finishing position in the team since last year's
bar race. J.S. really stretched out at the finish
to come in 7th, 4 places behind Bor Nosnilla.
The oppo's plot having been an almost complete
success, the Police gained a narrow victory by
2n points to n. R.H.A.
168
HOUR
WEEK
For Maureen Martin
to look after her handi-
capped son Jimmy, is an
168 hour week. Jimmy,
who is ten, and born
with neither legs nor his
right arm, receives no
benefits from the Attend-
ance Allowance Board.
Frequent night-mares,
the need to be fed,
washed, taken to the
toilet and put to bed re-
quires 24 hour attention.
The artificial legs on
which Jimmy walks to a
local junior school wear
rapidly through his
clothing. Recently his
mother's main fear is
that if unattended, as
the board suggests,
when crossing the road,
there might well be no
further problems since
there could well be no
more Jimmy.
In spite of this, on five
separate occasions the
board has refused Jim-
my partial or full bene-
fits. But now three years
of campaigning and a
nationwide petition may
lead to a private mem-
bers bill in the Com-
mons on January 23rd
amending the board's
practices. The bill affect-
ing 5,000 handicapped
persons is seeking to
amend the 1972 Nat-
ional Insurance Act. It
calls for an open hear-
ing of all cases, the
right to cross examine
board witnesses and the
right of appeal. Sheets
of crisp, inert, white
paper and the oratory of
one man will support
Jimmy Martin on Janu-
ary 23rd. Let us hope
they give him more than
two false legs to stand
on throughout life.
