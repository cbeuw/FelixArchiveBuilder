AS IT WAS
A new regular feature of excerpts from Felixes
of 5, 10, 15 and 20 years ago. Read carefully, as
some topics are still around today.

Viewpoint
Those of you with eyes must have noticed that
the Union has undergone a considerable face-
lifting. Its walls and ceilings are brighter, its floor
c | e a n e r — a n d going to be kept clean. So far, so
good. Now for the criticism.
Slovenliness
The Lounge is nice, warm and quiet (except dur-
ing lunchtime and Hop nights) where one can sit
in casual comfort. This casualness, I feel, has
gone a bit too far recently, amounting to down-
right slovenliness. Glasses and teacups on the
floor, ashtrays below the settees, ash and matches
strewn all over the floor and tables, newspapers on
the seats. W H Y do we have to drop our paper
when we get up. Is it too much effort to place them
on the side tables?
Maids
The rest of the union comes in for the same
treatment, muddy feet ignore the door-mats. This
sort of treatment is not deserving of the Union.
It might be all right in one's own digs visited
perhaps by a maid once a week and by the land-
lady once a month, or when she smells kipper oil.
But please not in the Union, which is used by hun-
dreds of others.
Refectory News
It has been running at a loss for almost as long
as anyone can remember, and three years ago
excessively large annual losses—£5,000 and more
—brought John Gardner & Co. to cut them down.
This they managed to a certain extent, cutting the
losses by abput 40%. The cut was brought about
partly no doubt by improved efficiency and econ-
omy, but partly too by a reduction in the total
number of meals served.
Mr. Mooney
The contract with Messrs. Gardner was ter-
minated on Dec. 23rd and Mr. Mooney is the new
manager. A great improvement was noticed last
term in the quality and value of the food being
served, and it is hoped that the new manager will
continue the improvement. An increase in prices
at this time would be disastrous, and can only
result in a further drop in the number of meals
served.
Silwood
The possibility of supplies to the refectory from
Silwood Park has been studied in great detail by
the Refectory Committee. The primary aim was to
provide vegetables, but it was found that by itself
this will not be very lucrative. Coupled with live-
stock, however, the scheme can be worked very
profitably, and would supply, besides vegetables,
eggs, pork, bacon, and chicken. The difficulty lies
in the large initial outlay that will be involved »'n
getting 45 acres under cultivation.
Grants
The financial stability of the average student to-
day is conspicuous, as they say, by its absence.
Too often, alas, it is the case of "Can I touch you
for five bob, old sock?" and "Might manage half a
crown. Jack". This fluid state of affairs, with a
string of people borrowing from each other, often
going round in circles, is too unstable.

Guilds to join NUS
At a Guilds Union meeting, it was proposed that
" C & G " Union should become affiliated to the
N U S " . Due to constitutional wrangling, however,
the motion was withdrawn.
Ill-mannered
Three years ago I was under the impression that
on entering college l would be mixing with the
cream of British youth, intelligent, educated and
good mannered. But this was a false impression.
I.C. students have proved to be the most ill man-
nered louts I have yet come across, using filthy
obscene language with no regard as to who is pre-
sent. It is not clever to be able to swear, to be ob-
scene or to be down right rude even less so When
young ladies are present, I am ashamed to intro-
duce people to the College. How much longer is
this disgusting behaviour to continue.

Struggle for power
College Union and the Imperial College Halls
are the most suitable for the students of Imperial
College. This is obvious to anyone with his eyes
open, but among the penthouse dwellers in South
Side, there are men who would change this and
provide a system based on Oxbridge, where sport
and social activities would centre round each in-
dividual hall of residence. Each hall would have its
own boating club and its debating society, and
each warden would have much more power. Our
union exists solely for the purpose Of the students
of Imperial College and we are the people to run it
as we see fit. Each year the penthouse dwellers try
their tactics on a new President and Council and
each year so far they have been thwarted. Let us
hope this situation will continue, because other-
wise our Union will become a replica of U L U ,
where the warden does as he likes and the Union
is converted into flats for his convenience.
Rachmanism
It has been brought to the notice of the College
Administration that there are certain persons oper-
ating in the London area who try to induce pros-
pective tenants of property to part with consider-
able sums of money for rent in advance or as de-
posits against damages and dilapidations. There-
after tenants have been unable to contact the so-
called landlords and obtain a refund of these de-
posits.
Members of the college who are seeking accom-
modation, and who are asked to part with sum in
cash before any tenancy is entered into, are ad-
vised to contact either their solicitors or the Estab-
lishments Officer before paying over any sums or
signing any documents.
Jazz News
Inspired by their successes in the ULU Jazz
Competition in December. The Jazz Club started a
series of South Side Stomps last Wednesday.
More than 250 people feeling the need for a spring
fling made the scene, served hot by the Kensington
City Stompers and cool by the Clive Heath Quartet.
Communism
The Communist Society in its first year ot exis-
tence has run the first ever Marxist Week in this
college. Two thousand leaflets and over 200 pos-
ters advertised a series of meetings intended to
show how the Marxist holds the key to many ques-
tions, political, economic and cultural, by not
merely asking How? but Why? Why do people
compete instead of co-operate, produce great
works of art and run countries?

I.C. Appeal
Imperial College launched a £2 million public
appeal for student and staff accommodation and
for academic and general purposes, at a press con-
ference on Thursday.
STOIC
After years of delicate negotiations in the hushed
corridors of Elec Eng and their inner sanctum of
the Union, STOIC is ready to run. Many people will
already know that the electrical engineering depart-
ment has a studio and one camera. At present this
equipment is operated by Technicians, but with two
more cameras arriving in the next week or so, full
use of the equipment can only be obtained by set-
ting up a student production team.
Bar Prices
Price increases take effect in the Union and
Southside bars from February 1st. There will be an
extra penny on all draught beers, bringing the
prices to 2s. 2d for union bitter and 2s. 4d. in
Southside. Spirits prices will also go up to 2s. 6d.
