NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
22nd JANUARY 1974 FREE No. 352
SQUAT
A 1 year baby girl and
her parents, along With
10 or so other homeless
people were evicted on
Thursday, 10th January
from the squat at Jay
Mews. Also evicted
were students from IC,
RCA and U C . The squat,
which had survived for
two months, .began as
part of the NUS cam-
paign for a living grant
and a place to live. 10
bailiffs and 10 police
were involved, and the
eviction went ahead de-
spite the fact that a High
Court Appeal was being
lodged against it. The
owners (Royal Commis-
sioners for the 1851 Ex-
hibition) have no plans
for the empty building.
It has been said that they
intend to make a high
profit sale from them.
Occupation
Occupation
The owners justify
this claiming that the
properties were to be
sold to provide money
for student scholarships.
The squatters, as report-
ed in Time Out, Ken-
sington Post, and on the
radio, were angry and
asked what use are stu-
dent scholarships when
students are homeless,
and why they cannot be
used temporarily . at
least? They also occu-
pied the board-rooms at
the "1851 "headquarters
(corner of Prince Con-
sort Road and Exhibition
Road) for two hours det-
manding to see someone
in authority. It was even-
tually agreed that a
meeting would be arran-
ged and the squatters
were hustled out by pol-
ice.The squatters intend
to continue their fight to
make the owners explain
themselves and to use
all the 1851 empty prop-
erties . . . Look out for
news.

1974 G R A N T S C A M P A I G N
by David Sinclair,
Deputy President
On Wednesday last,
the N U S grants cam-
paign 1974 was activat-
ed by a press confer-
ence given by John Ran-
dall, President, N U S . He
stressed again the main
points of the campaign
which is now summaris-
ed under the heading
"Fair grants for all stu-
dents".
Specifically,
means
this
(i) an end to the dis-
cretionary awards sys-
tem whereby some stud-
ents are given a grant
fixed at the whim of
their LEA. This should
be stopped by setting
grants nationally.
(ii) an end to finan-
cial discrimination
against women students
whereby some students
have their grant cut be-
cause they marry. This
should be stopped by ig-
noring marital status.
(iii) an end to the par-
ental contribution where-
by soime students have
their grant cut because
their parents do not or
cannot contribute to
their upkeep. This
should be stopped by
ending means testing.
(iv) an increase in the
grant basic rate to £655
(£720 for I.C. students)
to allow for inflation.
(v) adequate grants
for equipment.
(vi) replacement of
the triennial review of
BLOOD DONING
AT I.C.
The amount of blood
used by the hospitals in
Britain equals one trans-
fusion for every minute
of every day. To supply
this need there are ap-
proximately one-and-a-
half million blood don-
ors. In the area covered
by South London, Sur-
rey, Sussex and Kent,
there is an urgent need
to recruit between four
and five thousand new
donors a month—one
thousand to replace ex-
isting donors Who have
to give up being blood
donors for various reas-
ons, and three to four
thousand to meet Jthe
ever increasing demands
of the hospitals.
At the present time
the South London Blood
Transfusion Centre faces
an additional problem in
that the three day work-
ing week has caused the
cancellation of blood
donor sessions in factor-
ies and offices. If the
College can manage to
muster 150 donors for
each day that the Trans-
fusion Service's mobile
unit will be there, it will
go a long way to bridg-
ing the gap between the
supply and the demands
that the hospitals are
making upon us.
The dates of the ses-
sions, which will be
held in the Union Con-
cert Hall, are: Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thurs-
day, 29th ito 31st Janu-
ary (a recruiting team
will be present in the
College from 22nd to
25th January).

grant levels by an an-
nual review based on a
student cost of living
index.
The main event of the
campaign planned so far
is a massive demo in
London on February 8th.
Over the country, stud-
ents are striving to in-
form people of their
plight and the necessity
to persuade the govern-
ment to accept the NUS
grants review 1974.
USK area chairman
Sonia Hochfelder, has
given FELIX the follow-
ing statement (slightly
edited, removing refer-
ences to coal stocks,
capitalist greed, etc.).
This term is of spec-
ial importance in the
grants campaign since it
is during this term that
the government is likely
to make its decisions on
the level of the grant,
and on who is entitled
to one, possibly for the
next three years. The
process of reviewing the
grants system and the
increase in the cost of
living, in which N U S
and the Department of
Education <arod Science
have participated, is
now complete and NUS
has submitted a claim
for a grant of £655 foi
all undergraduate stud-
ents, regardless of
course, parental income
or, in the case of wom-
en, marital status. Now
we have to show the
government that we are
absolutely determined
to get a system of fair
grants for all students
and that if this is not
forthcoming then the
government will be fac-
ed with mass militant
action by students
throughout the country.
ENANTS ASSOC.
EXECa 0 I TEa
The first meeting of
the ICTA Executive Com-
mittee was held last
Wednesday, 16 January.
Officers
At the meeting the
following officers were
elected: Chairman, M r .
Salisbury, Falmouth
Hall; Secretary, Mr.
Gray, Tizard Hail; Trea-
surer, M r . Wadsworth,
Falmouth Hall; Assistant
Treasurers, Messrs. Ste-
fanou, Fitzgerald and
Webber, from Keogh,
Linstead and Weeks res-
pectively. There were
no nominations for the
post of publicity officer.
Hamlet Gardens
There was a discus-
sion on the inclusion of
the Union flats at Hamlet
Gardens within the con-
stitution. It was decided,
on a vote, that they
should not. (2 for, 8
against, 2 abstentions).
The quorum was drop-
ped from 200 to 150.
There was an addition
in that the Executive
Committee may co-opt
additional non-voting
members as they may
deem fit. The constitu-
tion was then passed as
fit for presentation to the
bank.
Situation
Mr. Wadsworth, the
treasurer, reported on
the situation of the Rent
Strike Fund. Forty-nine
people had paid to the
fund, a total of around
£2,100. This was in
comparison to over 700
having paid into college.
There were still about
400 people who have yet
to pay at all.
Aims
There was a brief
discussion on the Ten-
ants Association. There
was no disagreement
with the fact that the
Association has not been
set up solely to run the
rent fund. It was the gen-
eral opinion that the
committee would and
should continue after
the rent strike has ended.
It was agreed that the
question of an entertain-
ments allowance for the
House wardens should
be discussed at the next
meeting.
