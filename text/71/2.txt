2 FELIX

Producing a profile of Miss Peggy Taylor,
this year's President of I.C.W.A., libellous
enough for Felix, has proved d i f f i c u l t . No amount
of excavation could uncover a sordid past, no
undeclared, hushands, no well-drained bottles -
i n fact, no Private Life.
Born young i n Hammersmith, she looked round,
took fright and fled to school i n Bedford. An
early interest i n the structure of things took her
into a chemical laboratory; and, although she has
worked i n several of these, at Seals Hayne Agricul-
t u r a l College, and also for the Ministry of Agri-
culture at Starcross i n Devon, she has never
managed to escape entirely, and i s now half-way
through her third year i n the Chemistry Department.
A believer i n variety being the spice of
holidays, she has canned f r u i t for fourteen hours
a day i n Sweden, lived under canvas i n the middle
of Paris, and nursed a sick fellow-traveller i n
a truck on i t s dusty way through Yugoslavia.
As regards her nursing a c t i v i t i e s , when two
or three of I.C.W.A. decided to retire from the
s t r a i n of lectures for a few days under the code-
word "1
f l u " , they were bullied and coaxed back
into perfect health by Peggy, i n no time at a l l .
The dramatic society find her an efficient
Roman hairdresser and she capably supervises the
dressing of their plays. When not under the
stress of imminent examinations she supports
"hops", and Arosa meetings. A well-trained
Icwarian she plays table-tennis and squash.
Tennis she plays for pleasure.
Whenever I.C.W.A. i s Involved i n College
a c t i v i t i e s , Peggy i s there, quietly enthusiastic
and playing an unobtrusive part. When asked, she
i s always ready to give help and advice, and (an
infuriating characteristic this) she i s always
right. You may think from a l l this that she i s r
paragon, but she i s inclined to lose umbrellas.
She i s interested i n Gilbert and Sullivan,
collecting old s i l v e r , and buying new umbrellas.
The only thin* we know which rouses her to anger
is an ill-mannered man.
F I L M R E V I E W
following the excellent Television adaption
of h i s book 1984, the name of George Orwell has
become one f a x l l i a r to many, and booksellers have
reported large sales of his two best known works
"1984" and "Animal Farm".
The l a t t e r has now been made into a f i l m and
i a currently showing i n the West End.
B r i e f l y the story i s of a badly managed farm
which i s taken over by the animals on i t , who lay
down rules f o r i t s regulation. The animals are
led at f i r s t by a kindly leader Snowball who i s
however soon removed as a "traitor" by "Pig Brother"
Napoleon. The f i l m deals with Napoleon's tyran-
nous rule and disregard j f the laws of the farm,
inoluding h i s famous amendment " A l l animals are
equal, but some are more equal than others1"
The producer has t r i e d a daring experiment by
making a novel with a p o l i t i c a l basis into what
may be termed a "cartoon".
The-artists have done a very fine job and
have put over Napoleon's tyranny extremely well;
he has been endowed with a personality of his own.
The actual colouring of the scenes, the draw-
ing and the sound traok are a l l s k i l l f u l l y oombined
together to express the story and are seldom wrong-
l y used. A soene with great effect i s the ani-
mals' revolt against Napoleon when one feels their
insurgent anger. This i s a bold experiment well
worth seeing.

A T Q.E.C
In choosing a f a i r l y recently expired West End
success, I.C. Dramatic Society no doubt hoped that
i t s reputation would ensure a good reception.
However, judging by the rather sparse attendance
i t appears that the grapevine must have been blur-
ting that this was not another Pheonix Too Frequent
or more l i k e l y , staging the play at one of I.C.
happy hunting grounds kept away those who did not
wish to mix business with pleasure.
If the criterion of this production were to be
based on the response of the audience to the humour
i t contained, i t would have been adjudged flawless,
but the excellence of the humour was offset by
some of the straight dialogue being a t r i f l e l i f e -
less. Ian Duff, as James Winter, by day a respec-
ted citizen, by night a reputed safe cracker, gave
an uninspired performance for the f i r s t act, but
improved considerably afterwards and acted well in
the last act. Sheila Taylor was never very con-
vincing as Winter's motherly, shoplifting wife.
In a l l fairness i t should be emphasized that i t is
very d i f f i c u l t for undergraduates to impress in
semi Darby and Joan portrayals (especially when the
make-up department does not appear to be on their
side.)
Nevertheless, the f i r s t act was a l i t t l e
static u n t i l the vicar blustered on to the stage -
Leslie Allen's hilarious characterisation of a
venerable absent minded vicar enlivened proceedings
from thence onwards. He conveyed the impression
of age excellently with his doddering movement and
speech, and his inclined posture - although i t was
f e l t that he straightened up a t r i f l e more than
his lumbago would normally allow. Derek H i l l ' s
version of Sam Jackson, a spiv type who was
Mr. Winter's "fence", was also well done.
The rest of the cast, with the exception of
the producer, Martin Jacob, who twice f l i t t e d on
to the stage as Asst. Comm. Preston, were not
encumbered by their youth. Peter Winter - the
white sheep - (or the shepherd who tried to lose
his crook) was adequately acted by Dan Boyle.
As his sister Pat, a female Artful Dodger, Judith
Kornbluth was very impressive. Janet, the appre
tlce pickpocket-curn-housemaid. and Angela Preston
(who fortunately was no angel) were commendaoly
performed by Barbara Russell and Rosemary Melvill'
"Herbert", the Imperial College phoenix, i s
back i n the Union office after his health t r i p to
Northampton. The carrots which for some reason
seem to be so dear to the Northampton heart are
back where they belong.
Taking an objective look at "Herbert" one .
could see that h i s colour scheme was more vivid
than formerly. Without partisan bias i t i s
f a i r to say that we painted the carrot i n a more
a r t i s t i c fashion.

Imperial College n n i 0 n welcomes Professor
R.P. Linstead F..H..S. who o f f i c i a l l y became Rector
of Imperial college on January 1st, this year.
Previous to this apnointment Professor Linstead
held the Chair of C ^anie chemistry i n the H.c.S.
I t i e expected that he w i l l retain an interest"
i n the progress of research i n that department.
