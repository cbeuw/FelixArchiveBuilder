Lacking a front page headline and story, for
i t seems that absolutely nothing has happened
during the Vae., and the term i s too young for
ma,1or occurrences. we thought i t was time that
somebody enquired into the progress made i n the
building operations on the Union Building.
*e found that, i n the o f f i c i a l wording, "due
to a lack of dressed stone'! there has not been as
much progress as was hoped. This has necessitated
abandoning, the programme originally scheduled for
Baster. The intention now i s to f i t a temporary
roof at the f i r s t floor level over the space that
was the Old lounge, so that this can be used as a
refectory. The original hope was that this side
of the building would be complete up to the top
of the f i r s t floor level by Baster.
When the temporary catering arrangements are
complete, demolition work w i l l start on the other
half of the building, and the Union w i l l lose the
use of the Upper and Lower Dining Halls. Natural-
l y , this w i l l involve consMwable shortage of
dining f a c i l i t i e s , and the Planning Dept. i s at
the present time concentrating on the new catering
arrangements. With better organisation and dist-
ribution of food, Ayrton Hall can cope with many
more people at lunch-times, and most probably
this w i l l become the central eating-plt.ce.
Loss of eating-space i s not the only addit-
ional discomfort to be faced after Easter. There
?i l l be two fewer rooms available for social
unctions and club activities. I t is intended to
use the Ayrton Hall more extensively this term.
Three or four Saturday night "hops" are planned
there before Baster. The general shortage of
rooms should be eased about this time as rooms i n
the Beit Building, at present occupied by Regist-
ry staff, become available for Union use.

Before^desoribing the events of the night of
December 10 , 1954, we give a word of praise to
the Mines' Entertainments Committee and a l l those
energetio people who made the Carnival possible.
She recent disruptions i n the Union i t s e l f
have made the organisation, of a l l dances a d i f f -
i c u l t task, butt not insuperable by keen endevour
and hard work.The deoorations f o r the Carnival were,
of necessity, prefabricated i n the R.S.M. and trans
ported to the Union on Thursday- a day before the
event- and there erected.
A l l the Dramatic Society stage f l a t s had been
mislaid, and the Miners had to find a substitute
for these i n a very snort time. They used paper,
which i n the normal course of events, would have
served the purpose admirably. I n a matter of hours
the Snack Bar and the Upper Dining H a l l had been
transformed into a f a i r y land Beer Garden, and
needed only "Mein Herr und Fraulein* to complete
the i l l u s i o n .
Came the magic hour of nine. Let the revfilry
commencell!
The carnival followed the course of previous
carnivals, with the rapid interchange of partners
as one after another of the men f e l l out through
exhaustion or inebriation.
Our beloved f r i e n d mit moustaches found the
world too hard, so he lapsed into the realms of
unconciousness.
The olook struck one, and the Cabaret commen-
ced. Herr von Kingdon should have known better
than to puix the l e g of Guilds. The building
shook as "Boomalakas" roared across the room, a^r)
the aoiigstera found i t impossible to continue for
five minutes.
We've never seen,
anything quite l i k e
Mein. Herr Buster t r i p -
ping the l i g h t fantas-
tic*, and tripping i s
the right word; not
since Kitch. pirouetted
on the end of a rope
l a the good old days-.
Dancing oontinsed
wall into the morning,
and the Jazz men i n the
Upper Dining H a l l Bank
deeper into a Rhythmic
tranoe and played t i l l
past 7.00.
res, a l l i n a l l , the Carnival was a
siiftcess, marred only tjy those moronic gentle,
men who considered It- greac fun to mutilate the
deoorations.
I f only they had put them up, how loath they
would be to tear them down.
