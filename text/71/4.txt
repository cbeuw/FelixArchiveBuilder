Dear S i r ,
X was shooked, astounded and disgusted by
the matter appearing i n the Christmas issue of
Felix. I t i s the habit of most cats to keep them-
selves scrupulously clean, but not so Felix, I
fear. This evil-minded feline has forsaken the
habits of nature, and has sunk Into a l i f e of
shame. He has become an abomination unto the moat
clean-living society i n London. I trust you w i l l
take steps to remedy this.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Cat lover.

SPORTS PAOB CONTINUED:
SWIMMING
The inter-college gala was held at Great
Smith Street Baths on the last Thursday of term
and resulted i n a win for RCS i n the swimming and
for C. & G. i n the Water Polo.
The swimming was made particularly interest-
ing by the 'ding-dong' battle between RCS and the
Guilds which was not f u l l y resolvedtatill RCS took
the relays. In the individual events the winners
were. Clark (3 events), Hoy and Spokes for RCS;
Hemingway for Guilds and Lampard (2 eventa) for
the Mines. Guilds took five second places. The
relays were hotly contested though both were some-
what spoilt by some crossing over into the wrong
lane.
The Water Polo was also well fought (the
accent being on the fought) with no one team hav-
ing a very marked superiority over the others.
The Guilds beat RCS 4 - 2 and the Mines by 2 - 0 ;
RCS overcame the resistance of the Mines by 2 - 1.
It i s hoped that a separate trophy for the Water*
Polo w i l l soon become available.
P O L I S H C O N C E R T .
The Polish Society i s new to the College, and l a s t
term they held their f i r s t open night.
An excellent advertising campaign, f i l l e d the
Ayrton Hall and conditions would have been even
more crowded had the Resident's Christmas Dinner
not been held on the same evening. However I n
spite of the packed house no one regretted atten-
ding.
There was dancing, singing and even an exhibit-
ion of f o l k craft at the rear of the h a l l . The
performance cannot be adequately described; one
has to watch and l i s t e n to appreciate the beauty
of the folk dancing,the magnificent singing of
Mowakowski andtthe Polish Students Choir, and the
enchanting piano r e o i t a l by Miss Malankiewioz.
Carols, opera and a wonderful 'joie de vivre
made the evening one to be remembered. 'FELIX'
sincerely hopes that there w i l l be many more like
this.

STARTING FROM ZERO.
Those of us who were here
last year w i l l remember the L.I.F.C.U.Mission
in the Christmas term. Mr.Metcalfe Collier, who
was our resident missloner then, has now publish-
e d the gist of his talks i n this one small v o l -
-ume, which w i l l be coming on sale soon.
As the t i t l e Implies, Metcalfe Collier really
does start rrom zero. These talks were given to you,
and this book i s written for you, as logically
minded scientists or engineers, who w i l l not be
taken i n by a'lot of hooey'. The foreword i s writ-
-ten by Dr. Spanner of R.C-S., and the author after
a brief introduction to himself, launches straight
into a discussion of 'Is there a God', and develops
that point through many channels such as - The
Claims of the Bible - The Claims of Christ - Did
Bible Miracles happen - Is Dogma really necessary?
snd finally asking you to make a decision as a
result of these observations.
This i s not Just another book about the Christian
Faith, but one that has been written by an ordinary
man (Metcalfe Collier i s an accountant), i n order
to present to you as future professional men, the
claims of Christianity,so as to assist you to draw
your own conclusions.
I.C. Christian Union are responsible for sales
of this booklet which w i l l cost sixpence, and «5a
recommend i t to everyone, as a sound logical ar\g-
-ument l i k e l y to produce thought-provoking disc -
-us3lon, and to help many folk clear up doubts and
errors.
