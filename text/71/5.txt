1 a week and a half just after Christmas
I.C. Mountaineering Club v i s i t e d a climbing hut
i n a remote Lakeland valley reached most quickly
by foot by way of mountain passes. The hut was
conveniently situated for rock climbing on Sea
P e l l , but i f Great Gable or P i l l a r Rock were
v i s i t e d "the return lay by way of the Wastwater
Hotel: most of the climbing was done on Great
Gable, this being the nearer of the two l a t t e r
peaks.
The weather was extremely cold, but mainly
dry, and there was only a slight sprinkling of
snow on the peaks. The wind was very strong,
sometimes making even walking on the high ridge
almost impossible. The Gable c l i f f s were
s u f f i c i e n t l y sheltered f o r quite a large number
of climbs to be done there, the highlights being
ascents of Kern Knotts Crack, an intimidating
crack on a v e r t i c a l wall, too narrow to get
inside u n t i l one i s about 40 feet up, ( i t i s a
great r e l i e f to get inside the crack as I t I s
too tight to f a l l out o f ) , and Lucifer Craok
which proved to be rather exposed to wind, and
i n I t s 100 feet was never more than a few inches
wide. Napes Needle was climbed several times.
Photographs of t h i s seem to show people hanging
on to an almost bottomless v e r t i c a l faoe with
hardly any holds. I n fact, the usual route i s
quite a safe crack with plenty of foot and hand
holds, leading to a very b i g ledge (the shoulder)
after only about 40 feet of olimbing. A delicate
move then follows, and an airy face (with plenty
of holds) brings you to the top of the climb after
another 15 feet. There are harder and longer
routes to the top, i t being usual for climbers
not to be s a t i s f i e d with the easiest way. Mem-
bers of the party climbed one of these routes -
the Obverse route, and also traversed right
round the needle at the l e v e l of the shoulder.
A large number of easier and longer climbs
were done, and nearly a l l the surrounding peaks
were v i s i t e d . Most of the climbs aroundj Wasdalt
are at a high l e v e l (about 2500 feet) but on one
of the most cold and windy days the party v i s i t e d
a low c l i f f just above Wastwater, where f o r onoe
we could climb without numb fingers. I t s shel-
teredness was the more appreciated when after the
climbing was done we walked to the top of the h i l l ,
Yew barrow, on the flank of which we had been
olimbing, where pools were covered with ice three
inohes thick, and a s h r i v e l l i n g blast was blowing.
The ridge fortunately led towards the Wastwater
Hotel, and the promise of i t s comfort spurred us
on.
On the last day a midnight ascent was made
of one of the nearest h i l l s , called The Screes.
The moon was nearly f u l l , though i t s l i g h t was
rather deceptive - things looked ten times further
away than they proved to be. The cold wind made
the t r i p a l i t t l e less romantic than i t sounds.
DID YOU know that almost 250 books have dis-
appeared from the Union Library during the last
three years?
