The Arotio conditions which spread havoc amongst
the weekend sports programmes,did not prevent the j
I.C.Cross Country Club from holding their annualorosa
coutttuy matohwlth Sheffield University at Sheffield.
The inclusion of teams from Loughborough College
and Nottingham University added extra importance
and interest to the match.
It had been snowing heavily sinoe eight o'clook
on Saturday morning,and this coming on the top
of a frozen hard surface promised to make the
course very treacherous.
A fine snow was driving into the faces of the
competitors as they lined up for the start,and
traok suits were reluctantly removed,At the word
"Go" forty runners surged forward throng* the
f i f t e e n lnohes of snow,almost trampling the press
photographer underfoot aa he disappeared i n a
f l u r r y of snow.
There was some confusion at the start as to
which direction the oourse should go,but T.Bailey
(I.C.) and A.J.BROWN(Notts.) soon took the lead
and quickly forged ahead.A thin mist creeping i n
from the moors blotted out a l l landmarks,causing
Bailey and Brown to go off course,so losing the
2nd and Ist places which they would inevitably;
have gained.
Meanwhile the rest of the f i e l d were slipping
and sliding over snow covered,frost-bound ploughed
fields,through streams and over s t i l e s ,
Hailes of Sheffield won the raoe with a time of
29m-3s,leading a strong Sheffield team to a surpr-
i s i n g yet well earned vletory, Loughborough were 2nd
and I.C. 3rd. Belley{7th).Meller(IIth),01dfield(I4)
Dearden(I8th),korris(20th),and Turner(25th) were
the sooring members of I.C.'s team.
Had the I.C.team excelled i t s e l f with the same
distinction i t displayed i n the Sheffield Union
later i n the evening,a different result might
hare arisen.
S O C C E R
I.C CUP CHANCE
HOCKEY
Last term provided the most miserable
sequence of playing conditions f o r at least seven
years. Only one match was played on anything
l i k e a firm surface, a l l others being played either
i n pouring r a i n or on a mud-patch; of the 15
matches scheduled to be played by the f i r s t eleven,
f i v e had to be cancelled due to u n f i t pitches.
The results show that the Club has not r e a l l y
held i t s own as yet against i t s stronger olub
opponents and t h i s i s most disappointing as the
team i s potentially the strongest sinoe we l a s t
won the U.L. Cup. There i s no doubt that the
forwards are the major offenders as, with the
exoeption of one match; they have seldom looked
l i k e sooring. Anything less l i k e "boyish enthu-
siasm* In t h e i r play i s hard to imagine and they
must surely appreoiate by now that mature considera-
t i o n has never won any game—— l e t alone scored
goals. In desperation and against advice, the
Captain has moved himself from l e f t baok to
oentre forward and he thinks that some improve-
ment has resulted. As has always been the case
I n I.C. Hookey the defenoe has functioned well and
In particular, Peter Mantle at r i g h t baok has been
consistently b r i l l i a n t showing how hookey should
be played i n the Classical style.
As usual, the 2nd eleven contend that they
are hardly weaker than the 1st eleven but with ao
strong a forward l i n e their results have been
rather disappointing.
Colin Spenoe has had a varied and varying
assortment of players In the 3rd eleven and the
•Xtent of the d i f f e r i n g strengths from week to
•pic oan be judged from the faot that the results
inolude a 9-1 defeat and a 9-3 victory.
One oan only hope that more clement weather
and r e s u l t s w i l l oome our way t h i s term.
On Bee.Ilth the Ist XI reached the semi-final
)f the U.L. Cup competition by defeating Westminster
t-0 at Harlington. The supporters of both teams
witnessed a very closely contested battle with the
honours just going to the home team.
For the f i r s t fifteen minutes the home team
attacked incessantly but somehow the Westminster josl
remained intact .By this time the visitors ware pay-
ing more as a team but their sporadic rata? an the
I.C. goal never really spelled danger,due to some
sound i f not spectacular play by t! ? home d?feiv:s
It was not u n t i l the near the end however tftifg
the v i t a l goal came.This was a fine effort e;-n"s5
Hodge,who having moved i n from the wing beat all
opposition and placed the bal] i n the corner- yf tfetf
net,leaving the goalkeeper well beaten.In n-5.tr ftp.fl<»
ness the end came with I.C. s t i l l attacking Hird.
Team;- M.McLeman,J.Anderson,R.Dytham.DSMoors,
K.Richards,P.Blackall.P.May,A.Holgate,G.Green(c*nt}
C.Brindley,K.Hodge.
The semi-final of the U.L.Cup willbe I.C.y Goldsmiths
on Sat. 29th January.(probably at Berrylands,L.S.e,'s
ground.) Supporters w i l l be most welcome and a coach
w i l l be leaving from the Union.

Last Friday's"Evening Standard" contained the
following information:
RUGBY OFF TOMORROW
Wales v. England.
Staines v. Imperial College ( a l l matohes)
This i s the second time that we have been men-
t i o n e d i n the press this season, as our defeat
i n the University Cup was considered, quite
r i g h t l y , to be sensational enough for inolusion
i n the results l i s t e d i n THE TIMES.
The f i r s t XV has been h i t hard by injuries,
and with several men playing for University teams,
has been slightly below the oustomary very high
standard. Nevertheless they have f u l l y justified
their strong f i x t u r e - l i s t , and the worst defeat,
12 - 3 by London Welsh 'A', was certainly no
disgrace for a college team. As usual, we have
shown a general superiority over other colleges,
but our only defeat by one,came,unfortunately, in
the Cup Hatch. This was played in appalling cond-
i t i o n s , and also we were foroed to play four re-
-serves. University College, knowing they '/ere up
against the Cup-holders of three successive years,
had everything to gain and nothing to lose, "hey
fought l i k e tigers and thoroughly deserved their
5 - 3 win. This result should certainly add -pice
to next years competition 1 I t is worth noting that
I.C.'s heaviest defeat In a Cup Match over a period
of s i x years i s 3 - 0 by Tets i n 1930. During this
tine we have scored 140 points to our opponents'
47 i n the competition.
This term there are many tough matches Including
a tour of Cornwall. Incidentally there i s also a
•friendlyl" with U.C., which should be a good blood
bath.
The 2nd XV, more than a match for most college 1st
teams, has inevitably been weakened by the injuries
i n the 1st team, nevertheless i t nas given a goon
account of I t s e l f and has won s i x of i t s nine games.
The s p i r i t and performance of the three lower teams
are well In accordance with tradition. Dan Fowler
(Ex a) must surely be the only' Rugby captain who has
been known to respond to his f l y half's shouts for
the ball by standing bolt upright i n the middle of
a loose scrum and shouting " I f you want the _____
thing, ooae and get i t yourself1" The s p i r i t of his
team was consolidated by a fine win during an a l l -
day (and nearly a l l night) v i s i t to Crawley, Sussex.
No doubt the climax of i t s •akaevements w i l l come
after the Rugger Club Dinner, so look out Frank.
