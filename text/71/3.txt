The thing we have a l l been dreading has at
last happened. There i s a Television set i n the
Old Hostel. Is TV a home-breaker or maker, does
i t destroy the a b i l i t y to entertain one's friends?
We w i l l be able to study the effects on Mr. Levine,
who says i t was a Christmas present. Anyway, i t
gives him a reason to turn his l i g h t s low.
The College are holding an Easter B a l l this
/ear at Claridge's Hotel on the last day of term
25th March.

The Editor has received, by post, a free
sample of F e l i x - the real CATF00D. We never
knew that FELIX:-
(1) Can be served dry straight
from the packet;
( 2) Needs no scraps adding;
(5) When served stimulates the
digestion, helps i n building strong teeth, and
ensures perfect condition with a smooth, s i l k y
coat.
Miners and others worried by impending clashes
with examiners:
Are .you nervous, restless and jumpy? Do
you find yourself talking to yourself(?) i n your
sleep? I f so spend a n- and free yourself at
•onight's Guilds Carnival. Clubs are obtainable
the usual offices i.e. I.e. Bar etc.

The Christmas Concert of the I.C. Musical Society
was held on Dec 8th. in c.A.H.
The Jaques String Orchestra, conductor Dr. Eric
Brown, opened the programme with 'Alcina', by
Handel, a quiet,lyrical piece, putting everyone
in a Christmassy mood. I f e l t that both this and
the 'Hymn to ST. Cecilia' which followed, however,
were strange choices for a Christmas concert. B r i t -
-ten's 'Hymn to ST.Cecilia' i s a very d i f f i c u l t
work to sing as i t i s unaccompanied. I t would per-
haps have been fairer to the choir i f they had had
something easier and more melodic to loosen up
their voices. As i t was, the soprano tone was harsh
especially on the forte notes, and we could not
hear the words. The soloists were Georgina Carroll,
soprano; Helen MoKinnon,contralto; Patrick Halstead,
tenor; and Bryan Johnson,bass; a l l of whom sang
well, although once again we lost many of Miss Car-
r o l l ' s words.
The five carols.which followed, were quite a re-
l i e f . The first,"Masters i n this Hall" i s a de-
l i g h t f u l carol, and both choir and audience en-
joyed i t , but the choir were hampered by the
acoustics of the hall which makes loud notes
deafening. We then Joined i n singing 'Good King
wenceslas', and the choir sang two unaccompanied
carols, 'The Truth sent from Above', and a really
delightful arrangement of the Czech carol,'Rock-
ing' which was beautifully sung. We again Joined
in with '0 Come, a l l ye Faithful', in which I
missed the descant.
The second half began with Elgar's 'Serenade',
which has a truly lovely melody and was very well
played. I can only say of the last item, Mozart's
'Mass i n C', that i t was excellent, choir and s o l -
-oists sang well and we were a l l sorry when i t
finished.
In spite of any Taults, I think that the Musical
Society should be congratulated on giving us a
most enjoyable evening.

After a coach ride to Silwood Park, and
a light tea, the XI or 40 students who found
the spare time for a cheap and invigorating
weekend were addressed by Dr. Sole, an author-
i t y on the subject of extra-sensory perception.
He described mainly the work done i n America
and his own work, using s t a t i s t i c a l methods to
evaluate the results of thought-transference
tests, where a subject guessed cards seart only
by various agents. The lecturer was very
convincing even to such an incredulous audience
as a group of scientists.
The lecture was followed by a f i r s t class
supper, and the meeting then divided into two
groups for discussion. Meanwhile a few people
acted as subjects for some card guessing tests
- only inconclusive results were obtained.
The impression Dr. Sole made on his aud-
ience was reflected i n the discussion groups,
one group deciding unanimously that the results
Dr. Sole and others obtained i s a discovery
about human personality, and not evidence that
their s t a t i s t i c a l m e thods were incorrect, since
control experiments showed only chance results.
The discussions went on t i l l about 11.30 p.m.
after which most people retired to their rather
hard beds in well heated Nissen huts.
Nothing was arranged for Sunday morning,
and most people went walking i n the pleasant
surroundings of Windsor Park. After another
excellent meal at lunchtime followed by another
free hour, the groups of the previous day met
to compare notes, and the conclusions they came
to were commented on by Dr. Sole. Then followed
a light tea before the journey back to Kensing-
ton.
