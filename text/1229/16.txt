Candidate Manifestoes
' A l l '
deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
The diversity, success, and
continuing growth of IC Clubs
and Societies is testament to
how important they are in IC
life. I basically aim to make
involvement, and running of
clubs and societies next year,
as easy as possible for all par-
ticipants.
Why me?
I am the Club captain, and
former treasurer of the Ladies
Football Club. This has given
me an insight into most
aspects of finance, and organ-
isation of a club, as well as
giving me the opportunity to
meet and work with people
from other clubs and societies
at IC and other Universities. I
have also participated in sev-
eral ICU events. M y wider
responsibilities include being
the A C C Women's Officer, and
being part of the sub-editing
team of London Student.
The DPCS job should be
directed by C & S members
themselves. M y objectives
would be to get viewpoints
and feedback from ICU mem-
bers in order to rightly repre-
sent them at union, college,
and university level.
Being an initial contact
point for individual enquiries
and problems is another
important aspect of the job.
I would also like to promote
inter-campus links, by encour-
aging events with club and
society counterparts at South
Ken, Wye and Silwood.
I think Clubs and Societies
are the best bit of IC. A s a par-
ticipant, it is in your interests
to vote and have a say about
their future!
Deputy President (Education & Welfare)
During my time at Imperial, I've
held the positions of year rep,
department rep and am cur-
rently the academic affairs offi-
cer for RCSU (science subjects),
so I have nearly 3 years experi-
ence of academic representa-
tion here. During this time I
have seen how the representa-
tion system is plagued by
bureaucracy, apathy and little
communication, this needs to
change!
Accomodation: Many stu-
dents are trapped; dodgy land-
lords exploit students year in,
year out. I would work to intro-
duce a system where the
impressed or disgruntled can
write about the good and bad
landlords/properties. Through
this others will know how best
to deal with the usual suspects.
Peer Support: I will work to
get a "buddies" scheme or sim-
ilar, organised by students, run-
ning in every department.
Where schemes already exist I
will work with those running
them already and do my best to
support them, and find out how
they can be made even better.
Supporting other Academic
Reps: M y aim will be to
increase the visibility of, equip
and support everyone who is
there to help you with any aca-
demic or welfare problem. With
this, everyone should know
who can help them and their
problems should be dealt with
swiftly.
My door will always be open
and I will make a real effort to
let people know I exist and am
there to chat about any problem
they may have, and then deal
with it.
Standing for All Posts
"Ifyc
Smit
u have a problem, if no one
:an help and if you can find
., maybe you can hire the
mi."
at's exactly what RON (Re-
i Nominations) has done
year for the New Election
jaign! So, if you would pre-
2olonel John "Hannibal"
r as your President - and
face it, what better leader
there been through the
>
e of history? - then you
Id vote New Election. Do
likewise if you think Sergeant
Bosco "B.A." Baracus can set
everyone straight as Deputy
President (Finance and
Services). ' If you think
Lieutenant Templeton "Face"
Peck is charming enough to fill
the role of DP (Clubs and
Societies), then vote N e w
Election. A n d if you think
Captain "Howlin' Mad" Murdoch
can best represent your educa-
tional and welfare needs, New
Election is the candidate for
you. We need a Felix editor, so
what better candidate than the
newspaper reporter A m y
Allen? OK, so we all know that
she's not a proper A-Team mem-
ber, but then the Felix editor
isn't a proper Sabbatical...
The A-Team's election
pledges include replacing the
entire minibus fleet with the
cool black vans seen in the
series. Secondly, they have
promised to put an end to
motorised mascotry. Jez, Bo,
Clem and Derrick will be taken
to bits and reassembled to form
an awesome fighting machine
that will defend I C . b u t , just
like on TV, you know that no one
will ever come to any harm.
