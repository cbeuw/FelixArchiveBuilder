ULU Elections
On top of our own Union elec-
tions, the candidates for the
top posts at the University of
London Union have been
announced, including one of
this year's ICU sabbaticals.
Students at educational
institutions across the capital,
including Imperial, will vote
online next month to decide
who will run the Union in the
coming year.
Standing for the only con-
tested position, that of
President, are Charlotte
Dawkins of Q M U L and Chris
Piper from Kings College.
Rob Davenport, this year's
Deputy President for Clubs &
Societies at our Union, is
standing for election as ULU's
Vice President for Sports. Also
nominated are Claire Wren of
UCL, standing for the position
of Vice President for Finance &
Societies, and James MacColl,
also of UCL, standing for Vice
President for Welfare &
Student Affairs.
There are some concerns
about the election, as it
appears that voters will not
have the option of voting for a
'New Election' candidate,
meaning that those standing
for uncontested positions are
almost assured of winning
their respective polls. Voters
will also be unable to spoil
their online ballot 'papers'.
All U L U members, except
the Returning Officer and
including the candidates
themselves, are entitled to
vote in the election, provided
that they have registered for a
U L U card. These can be
obtained from Union Reception
in Beit Quad, or from the ULU
reception in Malet Street.
Passwords providing access to
the online voting site will be
distributed within the next
two weeks.
ULU successfully piloted its
online voting scheme last year,
and this year's ULU sabbati-
cals were the first people in
the UK to be elected to public
positions by an electronic poll.
The launch of the first stage
of ULU's electronic voting
process on 4 March is due to
be attended by Robin Cook MP
Leader of the House of
Commons, who is a supporter
of introducing similar technol-
ogy to future parliamentary
ballots following the small
turnout at the 2001 General
Election. This year's local elec-
tions will give the electorate
the option of voting electroni-
cally for the first time.

ULU elections is available at

Nurses at Wye? News In Brief
Preliminary negotiations are
underway between the
authorities at Wye and the
NHS to provide accommoda-
tion for nurses on campus.
The current plan involves the
letting of one or two buildings
to the NHS for this purpose,
and giving the nurses full
access to the bars and sports
facilities.
The Union have been
involved at every stage of
these negotiations, and will
continue to be consulted as
they progress. Felix has been
assured that this deal, if it
happens, will be to the bene-
fit of both the Union as a
whole and the students at
Wye, and the on-going con-
sultation should make sure
that this continues to be the
case.
Wye is already accommo-
dating 55 cadets from the
Police Training academy in
Ashford. It is not thought that
any further such ventures are
being planned, as the Provost
of Wye recently announced
his intention to see student
numbers there rise by ten per-
cent a year for each of the
next five years.
In other news from Wye,
Felix has learnt that College is
in the process of disposing of
another of the residences
there - Coldharbour House - in
order to raise funds. It is not
yet known how this, com-
bined with the increase in let-
ting accommodation to non-
students, will affect the
Provost's planned increases in
student numbers.

NUS Referendum Date Set
A date has now been set for
the referendum on Imperial
College Union's affiliation to
the National Union of
Students. The poll will take
place on 14 and 15 March in all
departments. The referendum
will require a turnout of 15%
(around 1800 students) in
order for it to be valid.
Campaining from both the
'Yes' and 'No' camps is expect-
ed to begin in earnest after the
imminent sabbatical elections.
Bo' Selecta
Boanerges, one of the mascots
of City and Guilds College,
featured recently on local radio
station BBC London following
its appearance at a dinner
held at the official City resi-
dence of the Lord Mayor of
London to thank all of those
who entered the Lord Mayor's
Show in November.
Bo', which reaches the age
of 100 this year, took part in
the annual Veteran Car Club
Run from London to Brighton
in the same month, in which
the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes
rode in the vintage car to per-
sonally deliver a message from
the Lord Mayor to the Mayor of
Brighton and Hove. The event
at Mansion House was an
opportunity for Bo' to deliver a
reply.
One of the presenters, resi-
dent architect Prof. Maxwell
Hutchinson, had infuriated the
engineers by calling City and
Guilds College an institution
of "typists," during his com-
mentary of the show.
