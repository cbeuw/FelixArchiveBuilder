Arts Festival
A festival of arts, per-
haps? Taking over dBs
for the entire after-
noon/evening, with arts
stuff. If you like arts,
you'll like this.
dBs, 2pm 'til late.
Trivia
Once more unto the
breach, dear friends.
What's the capital of
Outer Mongolia? What
was the date of
Gladstone's Bag?
Da Vinci's, 8-ish.
Cheesy Wotsits
Words fail to describe
this extravaganza of
delight. People return
from matches to com-
miserate or celebrate,
and then get drunk. Yus.
Union, For Ever
Comedy
So you think you're
funny, do you? Luckily
we'll never find out,
because we get profes-
sionals in. Tony Law is
this week's victim.
dBs, 7:30pm

Rat Race
If you liked Airplane,
you'll probably like this,
but then you'd also
probably like a compli-
mentary lobotomy.
Come to my office for
your free trial.
The Princess Diaries
I remain convinced that
this will be a reworking
of Pygmalion, but hav-
ing not seen it, I have no
right to comment. Not
that that will stop me, of
course. Ha ha ha.
Iris
Sadly not an in-depth
documentary on the fas-
cinating subject that is
the human visual organ,
but instead about Iris
Murdoch: she's not even
related to the A-Team...
From Hell
I guite like the sound of
this film, but since I've
been rude about all the
other films, I have to be
fair and say that this is
probably a big hairy
load of bollocks.
Vanilla Sky
Not quite as catchy as
his cousin, Mr. Ice, this
film is about a failed rap-
per who was the son of
some hippies, born into
the world of flower
power. Not really.

Ben A n d Jason
Similar to Belle and
Sebastian, but w i t h
slightly less pretentious
names. Okay, I admit, I
should have heard of
them but I haven't. Fine.
Hanover Grand
Black Rebel Motorcycle
Club
But I have heard these
guys, and one of my
muso friends told me
they were like someone.
Jesus and Mary Chain?
The Mean Fiddler
Richard Hawley
Bloke from Pulp and The
Longpigs crooning away
in a poppy kind of fash-
ion, maybe slightly
rocky poppy, come to
think of it, choppy!
Cargo
Drowning Pool
No idea, but you might
have heard of them.
They're the only people
on today, so that's why
they're here. They might
be really good!
Mean Fiddler
BuffSeeds
Similar emotions on this
one, but again may be
worth a listen. Some
chap here says they're
average. So I probably
wouldn't bother, then.
