Candidate Interviews
>#»a«jty Pre^wMn^MMlT & Societies)
Why do you want to do this
job?
I have been involved with Clubs
and Societies since my first year
and I think it would be a great
opportunity to get stuck in, be
responsible and make a differ-
ence.
What experience do you have?
I'm approachable and a natural
problem solver. In particular, I
have been Treasurer of the
Ladies' Football so have an
understanding of the paper-
work and processes involved. I
have also become increasingly
involved in the Union itself and
feel that the experience I've
gained can be of use to others.
What's the best thing about
Clubs and societies at
Imperial?
For me, I think the best thing is
the fact that they exist because
of volunteers. They're not doing
it because they have to, but
because they want to, and a lot
of enthusiasm and enjoyment
comes with that.
What's the single biggest thing
that you would change?
I really want to increase the
links between the campuses. I
think there are a lot of people
who do similar things at Wye
and Silwood, for example, who
could learn a lot from the clubs
at South Ken, and vice versa.
What about the differences in
funding between clubs?
There are many considerations
that need to be taken into
account when comparing clubs,
the primary one of which is
what is actually being funded.
For instance, the Yacht Club
may require a new boat that
may cost several thousand
pounds, but without that fund-
ing, the club couldn't exist.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
I am interested enough and
dedicated enough to do the job,
and I think I'll do a good job at
that!

i Deputy Presidemr(BaMcMion & Welfare)
Why do you want this job?
I've done a lot of positions in the
education structure and I've
often felt that they're under
supported.
What experience do you have?
I started off as a year rep in the
first year, then I was a depart-
ment rep in the second year
and I am currently the
Academic Affairs Officer for
RCSU
What's the best thing about
the Union's Education and
Welfare policy?
I think the best thing is quite a
lot of the volunteers who actu-
ally do the posts, some of the
years... the enthusiasm of the
people involved, and I really
want to use that.
A n d the worst thing?
It's quite bureaucratic, too offi-
cial.
If someone came into your
office and makes a homopho-
bic/racist/sexist comment,
how would you react?
I would probably let it pass,
and assess the situation, and
find out what their problem is.
Do you think that political
campaigning is part of your
job?
I would see that as something
that falls between my job and
that of the President. I think
that if either of us think that it's
an issue, we would discuss it
together, and then both decide
jointly how to go about it. I
think a lot of people vote for a
particular president on that,
based on their manifesto.
How will you judge your suc-
cess?
I want people to talk more, and
know who to turn to if they
need to.
What makes you the best can-
didate?
I'm the only one. I've got experi-
ence of the academic structure,
I've been there and I've done
that.
Standing for All Posts
R O N means Re-Open
Nominations. If R O N wins in
any post, then new candidates
will be requested and another
election will take place.
Why should we vote RON?
RON is there for those who feel
the real candidates wouldn't do
a good job. You can ask for new
people to stand for our post.
What experience do the A-
team have?
Hannibal is a Colonel and what
better leader can you think of?
He'd make a fine President.
I'm sure BA would be a pretty
scary DP(F&S) and wouldn't let
anyone spend any money that
they weren't supposed to. I'm
sure Face is charming enough
to help everyone with their
clubs and societies and
Murdoch can help everyone
with their educational and wel-
fare needs. The candidate for
the Felix Editor is Amy Allen
who is actually a journalist in
the series, so I'm sure she d fit in
fine into that role.
Does R O N ever want the elec-
tions to end?
RON wants the elections to con-
tinue until there's someone suit-
able in each post, rather than
the students just thinking that
they've got to vote for this per-
son or the other because some-
one told them to, or because
nobody else is standing. The
reason for RON is to make sure
people are voted in for the right
reasons.
Where there's doubt about a
candidate's ability to do the job
it gives a chance for a second
try.
Why should I vote for you?
Because you might not think
that the candidates are any
good.
