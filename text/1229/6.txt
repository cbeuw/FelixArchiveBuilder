From The Ashes
Phoenix is the A r t and Literature magazine of the college. It is
published once a year in the summer term, but here's a selection
of the material that has been submitted so far. This year, Phoenix
will also contribute to a week long exhibition as part of the Arts
Festival week (February 25th - March 1st). It offers a chance for
members of the college to have their stories, photos, paintings
and poems published and displayed around college. If you
would like to contribute please e-mail claire.trippl@ic.ac.uk.
Apology
Let me not in the workings of my mind
Profess consistency. Life is not life
Which sees success and chooses to be kind
Or works to ease the never ending strife.
O no it is the never fixed mark,
As sullied as the average canteen cup
Filled with pain, torment and thoughts ever dark
With one fixed truth - sometimes people just screw up.
Sense lost, grammar a veritable sea
Coherence ripped and stripped no more to be.
So if this coursework's crap and from me marks that takes
Please note we learn the most from our mistakes...

Matrix
Welcome.
Welcome to the world they made for you.
To a world without pain.
Because your nerves have been cut.
To a world without want.
Because your desires have been removed.
To a world without hate.
Because your fury has been suppressed.
Never more to be lost.
Because they know exactly where you are.
Never more to be unloved.
As they strip your mind of resistance.
Never more to fear.
As the truth is kept from you.
No more nightmares.
No more dreams.
No more sorrow.
No more joy.
This is the beginning of your new life.
You are already dead.
