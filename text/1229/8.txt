IC Radio
union talk
IC Radio's Science at Six is
home to t h e Vagina
Monologues, home-cooking
your o w n aphrodisiacs, and
psychological insights to
help you w i n friends and get
them into bed. But is this
Science? We think so. You
can tune in to enjoy the show
every Tuesday at 6pm for an
hour of delight a n d enlight-
enment.
So w h o produces this
excellent magazine pro-
gramme, full of drama, w i t
and fresh facts from the
world of Science? Well, t w o
teams from Imperial's
Science M e d i a Production
course compete to create an
hour of science-talk a n d
music every other week.
Each team tries to outdo the
other in their drive to bring
you a fresh, upfront science
programme that's more Five
Live than Radio 4, more
Channel 4 than BBC 2, with a
fast moving format to carry
you from six to seven.
The stuff we throw into the
show each week depends
entirely on the whim of the
production team but as w e
broadcast anything up to ten
items in the hour, we guaran-
tee there'll be something for
you.
In the last few weeks,
Science at Six has brought
you careers advice from a
head-hunter w h o w a r n e d
that if your application lacks
the correct keywords, the
computer scanning your
neatly word-processed epis-
tle w i l l b i n it before t h e
human resources human as
much as casts their eyes over
it! Real head-hunters fea-
tured in a book review - its
amazing what people w i l l
collect - and they did not
even have formaldehyde at
the time. Not only that, but
we've kitted up in high-tech
motor-biking clothes a n d
hosted our very o w n Blind
Date for lovelorn Marie Curie.
We've had far out animal
sound effects, interviews
with real scientists and a few
that we've just made up and
raged against the status quo
by tracking d o w n science's
most controversial charac-
ters.
We get our kicks from tak-
ing a lop-sided view of sci-
ence and if you're gutted to
have missed any, w e archive
every second of what w e
broadcast at
icradio.com/relive, just scroll
back to the last Tuesday and
we're there for you to click,
listen and enjoy!
The Science At Six Show hap-
pens at 6-7pm on Tuesdays
