Candidate Interviews
Felix Editor
Why do you want to be Felix
Editor again?
I enjoy it. I think, due to the
experience I've got, that I'll be
better than the other candi-
dates and that I'll improve Felix.
What's the best thing about
Felix at the moment?
I like the diary, and I like the
crossword. [Why?] Because the
readers like the diary and the
crossword and that's my job.
What's the single biggest
change you want to make?
I'd like to make Felix look more
interesting, and be more inter-
esting by giving writers more
power to do what they want.
What magazines/newspapers
would you like Felix to emu-
late?
In a perfect world, and if money
were no object, Id like it to look
like Empire and have the con-
tent of a broadsheet. I want it to
have a feel slightly more like
TimeOut. I enjoy, the diary and
the review sections. I think
other people do too - they read
the second half much more than
the first. I have a duty to the
people who read it, and as such
I want to do whatever people
like. Some people said they
liked the colour front covers last
year - from a financial point of
view, that's impossible, but
maybe we need to make it feel
more like a magazine. If I did
get it again, I'd spend a lot of
next term doing surveys to find
out what people want.
How would you judge your
success?
If people came up to me at the
end of next year and said it was
better than the year before, then
I'd think I had done a good job.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
I don't think anyone can appre-
ciate how much effort goes into
Felix unless they've tried to do it
themselves. I also think that
Felix should be fun for both the
readers and the people who put
it out each week - I'm a club
president as well as an Editor.
Felix Editor Â»
Why do you want to do this
job?
First, I think I would enjoy doing
the job. I already enjoy working
for Felix - I do lots of work for
them at the moment as Music
Editor. The most important rea-
son is because I'm certain I
could do a very good job.
What experiences have you
had that y o u think w o u l d
make you good at this job?
Obviously the experience that
I've had in Felix doing music - I
think that's quite similar to the
job of Editor. I also do quite a lot
with IC Radio. I think all of this
shows that I work well as part
of the team. I'm a team player
and I can get along with people
very well and motivate them
well too.
What's the best thing about
Felix at the moment?
I think I'd probably say the
College news. It tells us what's
going on in College and the
Union, which is probably the
mam purpose of Felix.
So what's the single biggest
change you would make?
It's important we include more
national and international news
and sport. I also think we need
to make more use of the Felix
website - we could use it to put
news up as it happens with
more detail. Finally I think we
need to make it more profes-
sional.
So, what magazines/newspa-
pers do you want to emulate?
Cambridge Student, which I've
read a lot of - it's fantastic. If we
can aim for some of the stan-
dards that they set, then that'd
be good.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
I have two years' experience at
Felix. I know quite a lot of the
things I'd need to know as
Editor. I'll run it more profes-
sionally - I'll try to run it proper-
ly. I'm very well organised and
basically I'm certain I can make
Felix a better publication.
*F*nx Editor 1
Why do you want to be Felix
Editor?
Because I think I can do it.
What experience do you have?
I edited my hall magazine last
year and I generally do a bit of
writing on websites.
So what's the biggest single
change you'd like to make?
I would introduce more articles
that are of interest, really.
About? What kind of thing?
News? College?
Things generally about life.
Last year and previous years
there have been articles on
things that were important -
financial matters, sexual
health. Those don't get covered
in Felix at the moment as far as
I'm aware. There aren't enough
articles that are entertaining.
There's a lot of waffly semi-
opinionated articles, but noth-
ing offering a concrete opinion.
What magazines/newspapers
would you like to see Felix
emulate?
I want to see it more like Time
Out, The Times and F H M .
How would you judge your
own success?
Whether people say to me that
they've enjoyed reading Felix.
How would students get to
write for Felix?
Well, I'd give everyone a chance
at least for Felix. I want to wel-
come people submitting arti-
cles and I would hope to
include more rather than less of
them but of course students
will very lazily write a lot of
rubbish so I'll have to exercise
some kind of quality control and
just not publish articles that are
just waffle.
Why are you the strongest
candidate?
Intriguing question. I don't
know what I would say, it
depends on what the other
guys have got really, and I don't
know whether they have... it.
Just the will to succeed.
