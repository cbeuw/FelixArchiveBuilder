Candidate Interviews
Deputy President {Finance & Services)
Why do you want to do this
job?
I've worked in the Union for two
years now, and I've seen the
Union from so many different
angles. I've worked with all the
sabbaticals, and I'll enjoy the
job and the challenges.
What experience do you have?
Last year I was SCC chair, this
year I'm OSC chair. I've worked
with the clubs and societies,
I've worked with their finances.
Also, I've organised two big
events. I've organised "East
meets West" last year. I was in
charge of organising
International Night this year, so
I was in charge of two big budg-
ets there and I think that will
give me an advantage going
into the job.
What's the single biggest
change?
I would like to introduce debit
cards use at the Union - not
many people carry cash any
more. I'd probably start just
with catering and, if I can, move
it to bars.
How would you judge your
own success at the year's end?
I want to improve on the servic-
es that we offer. This can only
be done by getting people to
come in and give their say on
how the services are provided
and what they want to see at
the bars and catering.
Some clubs get £50 per head,
while some get only £1. What
do you think of this?
One thing I would like to do is to
look at policies so every club
and society are on the same
playing field and get an even
chance.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
Simply because of my experi-
ence with the Union. I've been
working closely with the Union
through the SCC and OSC, I've
got to know the staff and the
sabbaticals this year. I've got a
good understanding of what my
job would be.
Depuf^Pfesident (finance & Services)
Why do you want to do this
job?
As the current sabbaticals
agree, spending a year at the
end of your degree is a great
way to spend a year. You get to
see a whole different side to
College life than you might do
otherwise.
What experience do you have
that qualifies you?
I think I spend too much time in
the Union drinking and working
in the bar so I've had some feed-
back on how the bars have
been doing for the past couple
of years. I've also been working
with the radio station as their
treasurer and Media Group jun-
ior treasurer.
What's the worst thing about
the Union?
Sometimes people get too
involved with Union politics
and get very pedantic - The
Union - it's for students.
Some clubs get £50 per head,
while some get only £1. Is that
fair?
Some of those clubs who get
more funding can provide
broader services like IC Radio
and STOIC. They go beyond
their members.
But what about, say, gliding or
underwater clubs?
Those clubs are quite specialist
and their members are really
enthusiastic about what they
do. I'm a member of Gliding
Club and clubs like that should
definitely be allowed the fund-
ing they get.
What standards would you set
yourself?
I think putting money in to pro-
mote and encourage students
to use the Union would be
great. Improvements in bar tak-
ings and an increase in finance
levels are important.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
I'm in it to provide what I think
the students want and need
from my post. If you agree, you
should vote for me.
Deputy Present fFmknce & Services)
Why do you want to do this
job?
I think I can, is the main reason.
What experience do you have?
I have very little Union experi-
ence, but I've got plenty of expe-
rience in the financial field
through working for various
agencies out of term-time.
What's the best thing about
Union Services?
They all seem extremely reli-
able, but I've only used them on
the South Ken campus.
Although I've been to Wye and
Silwood I haven't investigated
the facilities out there, or at
Mary's or Charing Cross.
What's the worst thing?
The communication. We need to
introduce a reliable and well-
advertised method for the stu-
dents to tell us what they want.
Alright, there are forms avail-
able, but they break down and
very few people know about
them.
Do you think the inequality
between funding for clubs is
fair?
It depends on what you mean
by fair. A sports society will
need transport to get to their
games and I believe that the
international group have a fairly
large contingency which they
can turn to. Whereas the sports
societies need entry fees, kits
and so on. I would be interested
in sponsorship for the kit partic-
ularly.
How would you judge suc-
cess?
If people like me, and people
say that I've been a good
DP(F&S) then I've done a good
job. I suppose I could also say
the profits, but that doesn't
include services and the Union
isn't a profit-making organisa-
tion. Profit should be regarded
as a bonus.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
I would say I am the strongest
candidate because of the
research I've done.
