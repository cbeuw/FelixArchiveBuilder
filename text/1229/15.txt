Candidate Manifestoes
Felix Edm
It is difficult for me to write a
manifesto, since the issues of
Felix that I have edited this year
are far better evidence of how I
like to work than anything I can
write here. While I do intend to
make significant changes to the
layout and design next year, I
think that the experience I have
gained over the last year will
mostly benefit the administra-
tion of Felix, which in turn will
benefit the students. I have a
good knowledge of how the
Union and College work, which
will help me negotiate the poli-
tics of both, and thus write bet-
ter news. I understand how to
get more money out of corpo-
rate advertisers, which means I
will be able to lower the cost of
advertising for clubs and soci-
eties within the Union.
More specifically I intend to
expand on the success of
Coffee Break, which seem to be
the most popular pages, and so
give yet more room to fun
things to do during lectures. I
want to have a greater connec-
tion with Phoenix, thus getting
more art and culture into Felix
on a regular basis, and I will
continue trying to get more stu-
dents from non-central cam-
puses involved in both content
and news. I also plan to make
the diary larger, as it seems to
be gaining popularity, filling it
with more that is useful, as well
as more that is silly.
Finally, I think that a second
year would allow me to do
things that I have not have had
the capacity to do up until now,
thus making Felix more enter-
taining to read and more fun to
write.
Felix Editor
Throughout my two years at
Imperial, I have been a regular
contributor to Felix. This year, I
spend 15-20 hours per week
working as music editor, and I
also have overall responsibility
for the new clubbing section. I
have written and edited various
other articles and dealt with
advertisers.
I present shows on IC Radio
for six hours each week, I am a
member of IC Symphony
Orchestra and I have also been
heavily involved in several RAG
events this year.
I will continue to run Felix as
a newspaper, but I will include
more national and international
news, and more sport. College
news will remain on the front
page, and I will extend the pop-
ular Coffee Break section. The
diary section will become a use-
ful guide to the week, featuring
detailed listings and previews.
I will put College news on the
Felix website as it breaks, so
that you don't have to wait until
Friday to find out about impor-
tant developments. I will also
put full, uncut versions of inter-
views, reviews and letters on
the site.
I will make Felix more profes-
sional, both in appearance and
as an organization in general.
More news and features relat-
ing to Wye, Silwood and the
medic campuses are needed,
and I hope to get more students
from these campuses involved
with Felix.
I am committed, experienced,
reliable, well organized and
enthusiastic. Felix is a good
newspaper this year, but I will
make it better.
Felix Editor
Youd be forgiven for thinking
Imperial College is the most
dull place on Earth. Actually,
there's a lot of stuff going on -
and there's a free magazine
you can look in to find out
about it all. That's the theory.
What went wrong?
Felix ought to be the face
and the voice of Imperial
College. It ought to be some-
thing we pick up on a Friday
because it's interesting, enter-
taining and relevant. But
instead we have pages of waf-
fle about nothing. Articles that
are as much fun as the lectures
some people read them in.
Serialised stories that it physi-
cally hurts to read.
There's plenty going on at
Imperial, and so much to do in
London - so why does a flick
through Felix at the moment
make me think I'm stuck on a
particularly uninteresting
island?
I will turn Felix into a maga-
zine you'll actually want to
read. Articles you'll find inter-
esting. News you care about.
A n d not just about Imperial
College - about London, and
life. We'll have an expanded,
informative, useful, non-grid-
based diary. More information
on the huge number of clubs
and societies at Imperial, spe-
cial events, things happening
at the union, and things hap-
pening in London. The Felix
website will also be improved
and kept up to date.
I will make Felix more like
The Times, Time Out and F H M
and less like the Silverlmk
Train Timetable (Autumn 1998)
and Littlesby Parish Magazine.
