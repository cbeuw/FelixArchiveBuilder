Condom-nation?
Dear person who wrote last
week's Inkwell,
If obtaining condoms is
embarrassing to you then are
you really mature enough to
be using them? The offering of
free condoms has to be con-
trolled for various reasons but
the first of them is the law. It
is illegal to encourage under-
age sex in any way and as it is
possible for U16s to use the
health centre, a form w i t h
date of birth details must be
used. Secondly, I have used
the service for 4 years and
have never found it embar-
rassing, just a useful service.
Is society so repressed we
can't admit the need for safe
sex? Finally some religious
groups oppose the idea of
contraception and therefore
on display to-be-taken con-
doms could cause these peo-
ple offence which stops the
health centre being for all.
I do hope however that you
don't find using condoms as
embarrassing as you seem to
find obtaining them.
Yours,
Jolyon Thompson, Aero
Dear Editor,
Inkwell has a point (Condom
Bureaucracy - Felix 8 February
2002) so to speak. Here at the
Health Centre we would dear-
ly love to leave buckets of con-
doms lying around for eager
students to carry away.
Indeed, we did give 2500 con-
doms to ICSU to distribute
during Freshers' Week, hope-
fully promoting safe sex.
Unfortunately, such gestures
of largesse are constrained
by... The Health Authority. It is
Kensington, Chelsea and
Westminster Health Authority
who give the condoms to local
practices to distribute free to
their patients and we get our
share. Although this is more
than other local practices,
because there is recognition
that we serve a student popu-
lation, it is not enough for stu-
dents to take as many as they
want. This is why we have to
limit the number that are
given to each individual.
Furthermore, in order to
qualify for this supply of con-
doms we have to provide sta-
tistics to the Health Authority
on the gender and ages of
those who request them. The
simplest, most economic and
efficient way of doing this is
to enter the data on to
patients' records and then
search for it. Hence the
request forms. The request
forms do provide confidential-
ity for students or would it be
less embarrassing to stand at
the Reception desk asking for
"6 naturelle please".
I am dismayed, yet strangely
impressed, by Inkwell's claim
to be responsible for Britain's
high rate of unwanted preg-
nancies. A more appropriate
assessment would be to
examine the unwanted preg-
nancy rate at Imperial College
compared to other universi-
ties, particularly those which
do not offer free condoms.
This is reassuringly low, pre-
sumably either because
Inkwell is active elsewhere or,
more likely, because the
majority of students think that
filling in a form is a small price
to pay for condoms.
Yours faithfully,
Irene Weinreb
NUS
Dear Felix,
President Ganesh gave the
reason in his letter to Felix for
holding a referendum that lots
of freshers asked for NUS
cards this year. If this is the
reason can I ask why there
hasn't been a referendum
before??
In the two years I spent in
halls as fresher then re-app
many people queried why
Imperial was not in the NUS.
The reason for asking the
questions was not because
NUS colleges provide cheaper
beer or food, or that NUS
membership would ensure a
better union. I would like to
guess that most wanted
Imperial to join the NUS so
they could have a NUS card
and get discounts at H M V and
the cinema.
So, why should Imperial join
the NUS?
Politically it would be a
bonus: it is a well known
secret that whoever becomes
president of the NUS mysteri-
ously ends up working at
Westminster within a few
years. Also colleges have to
declare a political allegiance
upon entry. However Imperial
has been apolitical ever since
the events of the sixties when
political factions of the college
created havoc. Only last year
the Felix editor was brought in
front of the council for his
political views within Felix.
On an administration level it
would give the Union extra
clout on certain issues
deemed important such as
fees etc. But would help on
external issues be exchanged
for a devolution of internal
powers to the NUS??
On the catering side being
part of the NUS cartel would
help to ensure the procure-
ment of cheap beer and food.
However such cartels exist
within college including
strong links with breweries
built up over the years: Has
anyone else noticed that the
prices for alcohol and hot food
in Southside and the Union
are cheaper than U L U and
most of the other London NUS
unions? If we were to enter
the NUS cartel what would
happen to the selection of real
ales for instance - would the
prices increase and the choice
diminish? However it might
enable people to acquire
Stella on the South Ken cam-
pus.
Then we move onto the
cost. To join the NUS requires
a yearly joining fee running
into tens of thousands. Given
the current financial situation
of the Union I would be inter-
ested to see where this money
is to come from. Perhaps from
improving the efficiency of the
central administration? I
doubt it. Last year the club
funding was cut severely,
with arts clubs being hit as
well as sports teams (if any-
one can suggest how to fit 17
rugby players into a minibus
plus kit without exceeding the
weight limit please tell me).
The summer ball is nearly
scrapped due to lack of fund-
ing: yet the Union can afford
the membership - how?
At this point I would like to
point out that I have no
grudges w i t h the NUS: at
sixth form I helped usher the
college union into the NUS.
Only there the fee was consid-
erably smaller and did not
affect the student activities. I
also agree that IC students
are discriminated upon by
high street retailers because
we do not have NUS cards.
Surely that should be what
the college should be cam-
paigning for.
In placing the opportunity
to get NUS cards certain peo-
ple in the Union are dangling
a huge carrot in front of the
students they represent.
However, four years at
Imperial have taught me that
wherever a carrot is dangled,
a dirty great big stick is not
too far away.

Simon Child (Phys IV)
