GFQQ - The Great Felix Quote Quiz
by Bobby Cyclops & Dr. Hot Fudge
1. "Nobody tosses a dwarf!"
2. "A wink from a pretty girl at a party results rarely in climax,
Karl. But a man is a fool not to push a suggestion as far as it
will go."
3. "Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father."
4. "Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he
looks? 1 don't think he is."
5. "I was hired to kill you. But I'm not going to. It's either because
I'm in love with your daughter or I have a newfound respect for
life."
6. "It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't
feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead!"

G F Q Q Prize Update!
Time to talk prizes, and we need your feedback. Fudge and I have
foolishly been given £300 to give away, but we want to know what
you want. For example, you could have a DVD player with a selec-
tion of DVDs, or a really good DVD player with no DVDs, or maybe
an X-Box, or a PS2 with games, or just £300 worth of vouchers - the
choice is yours! So with your answers this week could you put a
note saying what sort of prize you would like, then Fudge and I will
put the wheels in motion - only a few weeks left!
Now for a joke:
I was driving to work the other day when the boss rang and said:
"You've been promoted." I was so shocked I swerved, narrowly
avoiding a small dog. Later on there was another call - the boss:
"Well done - I'm promoting you again." Startled, I swerved, this
time having a lucky escape with a Granny. When I was nearly at
work the phone rang once more - the boss! "Congratulations, you're
now a chief executive!." This was all too much for me... I lost con-
trol and went straight into a wall - a write-off. When I finally got to
work, the boss demanded why I was late. M y reply: "I careered of
the road". Bobby Cyclops
