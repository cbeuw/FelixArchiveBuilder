Football Cup Hype
LSE 6ths: 2 IC 6ths: 3
The day began well, crisp
spring sunshine streaming in
through a gap in the curtains, a
clear blue sky. The biggest day
thus far in my footballing
career was a tough semi-final
away to fourth placed LSE
6ths, a team that had compre-
hensively beaten us 6-2 in the
league. The preparations had
begun the night before, a car-
bohydrate-full pasta meal and
only 4 pints of Guinness, taking
it easy. Arriving in the quad
and catching the train to
Berrylands was quieter than
usual, the customery bickering
and banter reduced to a mini-
mum as everyone concentrated
on the task in hand.
The game kicked off on time
and we saw the teams were
equally matched. The referee
however was a little different,
he booked Seb, our keeper, for
marking the six yard box (offi-
cial FA rules do not list it as a
bookable offence) although he
was fully justified in warning
Mike immediately afterwards
for telling everyone that "the ref
hasn't got a clue." Still, no mat-
ter. The first half was tight -
they had a couple of half
chances and Dave and Luis
went close for us. A construc-
tive teamtalk and feedback
from our supporter Neem con-
firmed that we were playing
well.
The second half commenced
with IC dominating, Dan and
Doug ruling the midfield with
Swiss efficiency and an iron
belly. Then it came, Dave
chased a lost cause and aero-
batically managed to keep it
on, the ball falling to Doug
Yacht Club
Last Friday eight yacht club
members squeezed them-
selves and all their kit into two
very small cars and set off to
Portsmouth for a weekend of
cruising. Once we had arrived
in Port Solent Marina and
found the boat we paid a visit
to the bar for some food, a few
drinks and to discuss the plans
for the weekend.
When we got up on Saturday
morning there was little wind
but not a cloud in the sky and
we set off early to make the
most of the day. Our original
plan was to sail round the Isle
of Wight clockwise but it was
quickly obvious that we would
not have enough wind to do
this. Instead we sailed the
other way to Yarmouth, on the
northeast side of the island.
After a perfect day sailing
under blue skies we arrived in
Yarmouth just after dark and
headed straight for the show-
ers and the bar. Several hours
later the trip back to the boat
via dinghy was a little more
challenging and one person
luckily escaped a swim thanks
to his rucksack!
Sunday was even calmer
than the previous day and after
a morning of sailing very slow-
ly up the Solent we had no
choice but to motor the rest of
the way. Having stopped for
lunch at Wootton Creek we
motored back to Portsmouth to
hand back the boat.

whose incisive pass released
Chris to shoot across the keep-
er and through the legs of
Anand (offside but he realised
and let it go). Goal! A rather
narked LSE team restarted
quickly and their striker fin-
ished a goal easily, all square
again. Not to be put off, we
came back at them controlling
the game, several chances fell
to our attack but nothing came
of them, the clock ticked by,
then out of nothing Chris beat
their defence and Goal! After
four minutes of panicky
defending LSE were stupidly
allowed back, a long ball found
their striker who finished neat-
ly. Was this destined to go to
extra time? Not if we had any-
thing to do with it. IC again
pushed everything into attack,
occasionally leaving us a little
exposed but Mike and Alex
reunited at the back covered
everything. A hopeful long ball
from Rob lead to a silly foul on
Chris about 30 yards out. There
was only one man who was
going to take it. Gaetan
stepped up and w i t h one
swoosh of his magical left foot
stuck it into the top corner. We
went mental. This time the
defence was resolute, nothing
shall pass. A superb final 10
minutes of blocks, tackles,
clearances and timely intercep-
tions by the whole team (Doug
heading off the line) means
that for the first time in their
history the Imperial College
6th team are off to Motspur
Park on the 9th of March for the
cup final. A n amazing team
effort, everyone playing out of
their skin, 100% concentration
and desire, who says you can't
always get what you want?
