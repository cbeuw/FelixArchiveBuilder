Harvard, MIT or Imperial?
A Note by Sen Ganesh, Union President
One of the key issues that has come to the
fore recently is the number of applications
to Imperial. Some of you may have read in
the press and media that there has been a
worrying trend in a reduction of applica-
tions for university science courses. Some
of this has in part been attributed to an
increasing mistrust in science. This has
also been compounded in recent years by
the Foot and Mouth crisis and the British
Beef fiasco.
Fewer and fewer students are studying
science and maths at A-Level and apply-
ing for science and engineering subjects.
Imperial College, being a specialist insti-
tution focusing on science, technology
and medicine will face the brunt of it. In
effect the market for good students is
shrinking and the competition between
the top Universities will get ever more
fierce.
So what is College going to do to com-
bat this? Firstly the College must main-
tain itself as a world leader in teaching
and research. We are a world-class insti-
tution with great resources and some of
the most talented students to be found
anywhere. Whatever the College does to
address these problems, it is important
that we must not compromise our posi-
tion as a leading institute and lower stan-
dards. .
One of the key strategies as outlined by
the Rector in his recent talk, is to improve
the image of Imperial College. Whilst the
College is well known is scientific circles
it is not as renowned as the Harvards or
the MITs of the world. Improving the
image will attract help attract the best
students and staff to maintain our high
standards.
Another short-term effect might be an
increase in the proportion of international
students. There is still a large number of
high calibre international students who
want to study in the UK but this in itself is
not a long-term solution. There are other
ways in which the College can address
this problem. The College has a well-
developed programme of promoting sci-
ence to the younger generation in the
hope of attracting more people towards
science.
Whatever happens there is going to be
a change in the culture of the College - we
are entering a new age of competition
and modernisation to establish our status
as a world-class institute.
