Shootings
Four men and a pregnant
woman were fired upon by
members of the Parachute
Regiment this week i n an
unfortunate incident that may
mark a turning point in the for-
tunes of the international
peacekeeping forces of
Afghanistan.
The six soldiers concerned,
part of the seventeen-nation
International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF), were
stationed in a command post
on top of a grain silo at the time
of the shooting, which took
place on Sunday evening.
Hearing gunfire and, apparent-
ly, bullets striking the walls
around them, the leader of the
party decided that the noises
provided sufficient evidence of
a "close and immediate"
threat. Under their U N -
approved Rules Of
Engagement, the soldiers then
opened fire for a period of
approximately one minute,
during which time over 100
rounds were fired.
One man was killed in the
incident, while two others suf-
fered minor injuries. The
woman - on her way to hospi-
tal at the time - delivered a
baby in a nearby house some
hours later. The paras involved
were taken off patrol, in accor-
dance with MoD policy, while
two - the corporal leading the
section and one other man -
flew home on Tuesday.
Speaking for the Ministry of
Defence, a spokesman insisted
that the men had at all times
acted in accordance with Army
policy, adding, "When you're
under fire from an unknown
direction, it's really a very
scary thing. You make very
sure that you establish where
the shots are coming from
before you do anthmg else,
otherwise if you stick your
head up it's likely to get shot
off." He added that "the shots
fired must have come from the
direction of [the victims' car].
They may well have got caught
in an unlucky crossfire."
A full joint investigation by
the Royal Military Police and
Afghan security forces is cur-
rently underway.
Bush In Korea
George Bush this week visited
South Korea as part of a tour
over the next fortnight of the
Pacific Rim countries of Asia.
The visit was expected to
cause controversy, however,
because of his remarks earlier
on this year in his State Of The
Union address. At the time, the
US president - referring the
US-led efforts to control global
terrorism he refers to as a
"war" - described North Korea,
along with Iraq and Iran, as
representing an "axis of evil"
from which the "forces of ter-
rorism.. . gam support and sus-
tenance for their wicked
deeds."
However, many in North and
South Korea are worried that
Bush's remarks may hinder or
even damage attempts at
reunification. Korea was split
into two countries following
the Korean War in the last cen-
tury - regarded by many as the
first real (successful) test of the
nascent United Nations. This
year the richer, capitalist South
plays co-host to the FIFA
World Cup with Japan, and
native pundits and businesses
are hoping the event will pro-
mote Korean values, culture
and standing to the world.
