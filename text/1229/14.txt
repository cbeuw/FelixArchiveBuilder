Deputy President (Fin > r » o « & S e r v i c e s )
The Deputy President
Finances and Services (DPFS)
is not only responsible for just
the Union's money but he or
she is also responsible for the
bars, the Union shops, the
catering and the Union
minibuses.
The role of the DPFS effects
all aspects of student life with-
in the college. This is w h y I
believe that DPFS one of the
most important positions in
the Union.
It is critical for the Union to
provide these services in an
efficient and effective manner.
My main objective as DPFS
would be to provide value for
money to the students that
use the services of the Union,
for increasing the variety of
drink promotions at the bar
and using debit cards in the
union for food and drink. It is
important for the students to
have an input in the way that
these services are run.
As the Chair of the Overseas
Students Committee I w a s
responsible for managing the
financial affairs of 30 Societies
and organising major events
such as International Night. I
am a member of the Union
Council, the governing body of
the Union.
I have also been a society
president and last year sat on
the Budget Advisory Group
(BAG). I have seen how the
Union is run from various dif-
ferent levels.
If elected, I will aim to
improve the standard of the
Union's services to meet the
needs of the students on all
sites.
Deputy PresideWflf^Mie * Services)
Justin Rodger - Who is that you
may think? Let me introduce
myself, this year I am standing
for DP(F&S). I am a final year
physics student, member of
bar staff and a union treasurer.
Why I am standing? Well, in
my opinion it's the best way
anyone could spend a year of
their university life and I think
more people should stand.
If elected some issues I
would like to pursue:
After much construction
work, the union building needs
a face lift to remove years of
dirt & grime and restore the
building to. its former glory,
sufficiently so to warrant exte-
rior illumination. Provide online
minibus booking and guides
for people who run the union.
Internally, union resources
such as room usage should be
efficient and encourage sab-
baticals to participate in club
activities as members.
Concerning current issues, of
course I would support the
student body decision on the
N.U.S. referendum.
What makes me suitable for
this position is my attitude and
experience. The resources of
the union should be efficiently
used and should offer maxi-
mum benefit to greatest num-
ber and as DP(F&S) I would
play a major role in this. I've
spent years in the bar on both
sides, I've helped run the
finances of clubs as a treasurer
and union officer and would
like to take a more active role
in union life. W h y should you
vote for me? Simple, because
you think I would do the best
job.

The union has seen many large
changes this year. I believe that
the new exec need to be able to
spot teething problems in the
new structure, and react to
them before they become large
issues. I believe that I am able
to do this. The DP F&S role is
split into two parts, and a com-
petent DP F&S needs to have
experience in both those roles.
During my year out I worked as
a Team Leader. M y team and I
were responsible, in part, for
reacting to people's difficulties
within the work place; both rec-
ommending more training
where necessary and changing
protocols around the office if
required. I believe that this is
valuable experience for the
Services part of the role.
Outside term time, I work for a
financial temp agency, which
means that I have spent time in
many of the large financial com-
panies in this country and
around the world. I believe this
is valuable for the post.
If I am elected, then there are
several things that I would aim
to improve. For example, at the
moment students can provide
feedback to the union, by filling
in a form, which is handed to
the bar staff. On several occa-
sions I have heard people com-
plain that either no-one has got
back to them, or are not happy
with what they have heard. I
also think that the day-to-day
role of the sabbaticals is not
very well understood by the
student body. Several people
that I've spoken to don't know
what a sabb is, let alone what
their jobs are and how us and
the union benefit from them.
