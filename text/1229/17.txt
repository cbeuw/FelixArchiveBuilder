Candidate Interviews

Why do you want to be Union
President?
It's a challenge! I think I have
the experience as RCSU
President; I've sat on the com-
mittees, I've gone through the
processes, I think I know what
I'm doing.
What experience do you have?
As RCSU President, I've pulled
the RCSU out of the quagmire it
was in, and I know the Union
staff, as well as its structures.
What's the best thing about
the way the Union is being
run?
The permanent staff have a
very efficient way of doing
things, and services are deliv-
ered when they're supposed to.
And the worst thing
The bureaucracy. It's as simple
as that.
What would you change?
I would stop debate on the con-
stitution and the way we do
things. I want people to focus
on what they're doing, and
focus on their jobs.
Do you think the President
should be a figurehead or an
administrator?
Both. It's a necessary figure-
head; it gives the Union some-
thing to revolve around.
At the end of your year, how
would you judge your success?
If people were still talking about
the constitution in twelve
months time, I would have
failed. If other people haven't
done their jobs, again, the same
thing. Also, if the services
haven't been improved one iota,
I would have failed also.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
My outlook. Because I want to
cut bureaucracy, because I
want to make things better, I
want the services to improve.
I've done it with the RCSU, and
I can do it again. I don't think
the other candidates have that
drive or that motivation.

Why do you want to be Union
President?
I think this year has been a
challenge, especially w i t h
respect to the problems faced
by the advent of faculties, but
we've also had the opportuni-
ty to start many new initia-
tives. I now have the skills and
experience to be able to
realise what has begun.
What's the best thing about
the way the Union is being
run?
It is democratic, and that is
important, and we still listen
to our students. A case in
point would be the faculties;
there were many disagree-
ments to start off with, but
now, after mass consultation,
we have reached a consensus,
embodied through the consti-
tution passed at the last coun-
cil.
What's the single biggest
thing you'd like to change?
We have a huge number of vol-
unteers who run our clubs and
societies, and participate in a
lot of our activities, and I want
to try and ensure that we
carry on recruiting good quali-
ty students, train them, and
put in place a reward system
that acknowledges what
they've done for us.
In a year's time, how would
you judge your success?
If I've accomplished the things
I set out to do in my manifesto
and if the students feel that
they've been served better by
the Union, then I'll be happy.
In particular, I would like to
help students find accommo-
dation after they leave halls,
and I would also like major
improvements to be made in
the induction of Freshers.
What makes you the
strongest candidate?
I think I have the skills and
experience necessary, I under-
stand how to do the job, and I
intend to apply what I've
learnt.

Why do you want to be Union
President?
Because I think, with my
breadth of experience of a large
range of different Union activi-
ties over four years, that I'm the
best qualified candidate in
College at the moment.
What experience do you have?
I've seen the administrative
side of the Union by sitting on
Council for a couple of years.
I've had real hands on, nitty-
gritty experience administering
two Summer Balls now, and I've
also been involved on the clubs
and societies side; involved
mainly with the Medics' drama
society.
What's the best thing about
the way the Union is being
run?
It's not getting worse.
What's the single biggest
thing you'd like to change?
I'd like to include new people,
by getting them to run the serv-
ices. I'm not about re-designing
the Union from the ground up.
At the end of your year, how
would you judge your suc-
cess?
Turnout in that year's election is
a very good indicator of how
involved people feel and how
connected people feel with
what the Union's actually
doing.
Would you want the President
to be a figurehead?
Definitely. It is the figurehead to
the outside world. That's how I
ran the Summer Ball and that's
how I'll run the Union.
What makes you the strongest
candidate?
With the obvious exception of
the president incumbent, I have
the best idea of how the Union
runs on a day-to-day basis, but
also over a large amount of
time. With respect to the cur-
rent President, I am still stu-
dent; I go out and hear what
people moan and groan about.
