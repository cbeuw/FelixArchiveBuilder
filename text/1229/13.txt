I will start a drive to improve
all services for students,
whether they are provided by
the Union or by College. Both
catering services need to
improve in quality and reduce
in price. The installation of a
cash machine in the main
building, the introduction of
card sales and the increased
use of the Great Hall for live
performances can only
enhance the Union.
Investigating College's health
provisions, both mental and
physical, and developing their
provisions for students with
special needs will help to make
a lot of students better off. I
will work to ensure the reten-
tion and quality of all depart-
mental and site libraries.
Outside College, I will cam-
paign on student debt,
increase the number of compa-
nies that give student dis-
counts to IC students and con-
tinue the attempts to allow the
Union to issue student LT
cards.
I will cut Union bureaucracy.
I will remove pointless forms,
cut the number of administra-
tive hoops that club chairs
have to jump through and stop
debate on the Union constitu-
tion. I will get people who run
the Union to focus on their jobs
instead of their CV's.
The Union is meant to be an
open and democratic organisa-
tion, responding to the needs
of all students. I will ensure
that it is. After all, if it is not
working constantly to improve
things for each and every stu-
dent, whatever campus they
attend, it is not doing its job.
President
Changes in government fund-
ing and the "London Factor"
have led to increasing pressures
for students. My goal is to build
on the advice and support serv-
ices and put student hardship
high on the agenda.
The changes in College struc-
ture have transformed the aca-
demic and administrative
make-up of College. The Union
has to ensure education
remains a priority and that we
continue to be a world leader in
teaching and research.
One of the biggest challenges
facing the Union is how we help
and support students at the
many campuses. I will dedicate
greater resources to integrating
the sites, improve communica-
tion and ensure that decisions
are taken where they are most
effective.
I believe the Union must
expand clubs, societies and stu-
dent activities, and support the
many volunteers that help the
Union. Additionally I would
ensure the Union plays a
greater role in helping students
find affordable accommodation.
The Union must continue to pro-
vide value-for-money services
and develop long-term plans to
meet the needs of the students.
As President this year, I have
gained the experience and
skills necessary to achieve my
goals. The Union has achieved a
lot, but there is more to do. We
must build on the successes
and improve services. I will
make sure that the Union con-
tinues to take the initiative, is
accountable to the students it
represents and provides practi-
cal and tangible benefits for all.
President
I don't want to change the
structure of the union - too
much time has been wasted on
this in recent years. What the
constitution says has no effect
on what is served in the bars,
how much the shop charges for
a paper clip or whether the
hockey team wins or loses.
The union needs a time of sta-
bility, good management,
focussing on what students
want. I will concentrate on
building up the Wednesday and
Friday entertainment pro-
grammes to compete with other
London unions. Together with
the permanent staff I will
encourage and make it easier
for students to get involved
with running all union services.
The structures for this already
exist; I don't anticipate any
major policy changes, just a
change in emphasis and public-
ity to put you in control.
The only structural issue for
the union this year is its failure
to recognise that IC is a multi-
campus institution. As a medic
no longer based at South Ken I
have an accurate perspective
on this problem. ICU needs
presence at the major London
campuses as a minimum.
I have the experience from
running last year's summer ball
to transform how the union runs
without changing regulations,
avoiding protracted debate. I
managed to revolutionise the
summer ball last year, turning it
from a failing institution in dan-
ger of extinction into an event
commanding a 20k subsidy
from college. As union presi-
dent I will endeavor to complete
a similar feat.
