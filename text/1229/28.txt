Hey there packers. Another crossword from the delightful Mummy
Huffwell for you to peruse over this week, I hope it is to your taste.
Cyclops and I are getting very excited because soon we'll be able to go
and spend copious amounts of College money on coffee break prizes for
you crazy kids. As you may already know, we'll be giving away a PS2 for
the winner of the crossword, and who knows what for the winner of the
mighty GFQQ. The crossword prize draw will take place on the last
week of the spring term and I'll announce the winner of the PS2 in the
first edition of next term. We thought it was fairer to end the competi-
tions at Easter, as people come back at different times in the summer.
The winner of this week's crossword is Adrian Rogers, JMC3. This
young web-wizard e-mailed his answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk, as you
are all welcome to do; or just fold your grid into a paper airplane and fly
it on down to the Felix office in the west basement of Beit quad.
Well that's all for another week, keep those crosswords coming in and
keep reaching for that rainbow!
