War On Water
Last year at Henley, what was
effectively Imperial College's
third eight drew Isis (Oxford's
second eight) in the first round
of the Temple. The race was
expected to be a complete
walkover for Isis, but in fact it
was very close, with our crew
leading for three-quarters of
the race, only losing in the
dying stages. We also usually
race either Oxford or
Cambridge about a week
before to head off the river race.
Last year Queen's Tower I beat
Cambridge and IC I beat
Goldie (Cambridge's second
boat). At the weekend we were
asked by Oxford to race their
newly announced crews on the
Tideway. This is obviously
much earlier than usual; conse-
quently we are still in the
endurance phase of our train-
ing and only moved into eights
last Tuesday.
The first race of the day was
between Isis and IC II. Despite
our complete lack of condition-
ing for a high rate blast,
Imperial College II were
extremely quick off the start,
rating 48 for the first few
strokes and staying well above
40 for the first two minutes.
This obviously unsettled Isis
and we moved out to a three-
quarters of a length lead, and
stretched this so that only the
canvasses were overlapping.
We needed a big push to break
clear at this point but the Isis
cox steered across into us,
ignoring the somewhat weak
commands from the umpire (an
Oxford coach). We came out of
the resultant clash much worse
off than them, losing our lead.
We should really have stopped
at this point and requested a
restart as our rhythm had been
unsettled, and Isis began to
row through us, taking advan-
tage of the umpire allowing
them to keep us out of the
stream. The final result: They
won by a length.
This pattern was repeated in
the second piece, with us
again leading them off the
start, not quite being able to
break clear and then clashing,
disrupting our pattern. In addi-
tion the bend was in their
favour so they came through to
win by half a length.
In the big race between
Imperial College I, a very
newly formed crew lacking
four of the Olympic gold medal-
lists we had last year, and
Oxford we again had high
hopes of victory. Once again
we were much quicker off the
start and built up a lead, only
to have this eroded as their
cohesion and conditioning
meant that they were able to
keep at a higher rate, rowing
through the crew to win both
pieces narrowly.
Despite losing, both crews
gained experience from the
racing and we know that in
March we will be much quick-
er. This weekend sees the
entire squad racing at the
Head of the Trent in
Nottingham, an event we are
treating as training m prepara-
tion for the Eights Head of the
River on the 23rd of March.
Hot Shots
On Saturday 9th February the
first inter-collegiate rifle
match for many years took
place at the Stock Exchange
Rifle Club (SERC). Teams from
Kings College, Imperial
College and the rest of the
University of London Colleges
competed over a course of two
10-bull targets. The one IC
team that completed was
composed of Ben Chowdhary,
Andrew Eldridge, Phil Golds
and finally Tim Aplin, who
was taking part in his first
match for IC. The journey to
the SERC was very scenic,
since we unintentionally
passed by many of the tourist
attractions in Central London.
At the SERC we quickly got
our rifles and equipment set
up, and then waited for
Andrew to arrive. Tim was
first to shoot and did well con-
sidering this was his first
match. Andrew did eventually
arrive and shot third after Phil
'Where's M y Bolt?' Golds. Ben
was last on the firing point
and like most of the shooters
that day shot slightly below
par. Indeed, throughout the
day there was an unbeliev-
able amount of cross-shooting
and double firing; Phil being
the only culprit from IC. The
final results were close, but
the U L U A Team just beat the
IC Team scoring 768 (ex. 800)
to IC's 760. Third were Kings'
A Team with 751, fourth U L U
B Team w i t h 703 and fifth
were Kings' B Team with 657.
Well done to everyone who
shot, we'll get them next time!
For anyone who wants to give
shooting a try, the Rifle and
Pistol Club meets every
Wednesday and Saturday at
12:30 in the Rifle Range, which
can be found in the Sports
Centre on Prince's Gardens.
