PHOENIX 14
SILENT
COMPANY
What is it that made you stick,
by me till death did us apart?
As my soul begins to sublime
my memory celebrates our journey
One that I chose to cherish
Though this body of mine should perish.
As a child in the arms of innocence,
I began to take joy in your company.
As we played on those fields together,
as birds of a single feather.
You never expected, you never complained,
never ever smiled, nor felt pained.
you did not speak, nor did you fear
And when it did grip me, I knew you were near.
Locked in an embrace, we waded through childhood
And heralded the coming, of thought and age.
Hurdles were many I faced to pass,
At some I thrived, yet some at a loss.
A steady refuge and a saintly gaze
An embodied comfort of mind and spirit.
You reminded me oft, the fragile mind;
that when hearts be broken, spirits be awoken.
Locked in gaze and a choice of finger,
we waded through life with a sprightly ember.
The bounty of seasons passed me by;
and time wasn’t left, in enough to buy.
Our jog became struts, body began to wither;
not much was left that we needed to weather.
You stooped as i did, we leaned against the other.
At last we choked and breathed our last together.
As men cast the shadows of their past,
you exist as the present till the very last.
