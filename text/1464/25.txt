Q1. WHO OR WHAT ARE YOU?
Leosoc is short for Leonardo Society, or, more
officially, Leonardo Fine Arts Society. Don’t let
the name scare you off! We’re basically a group of
Imperial students (and the odd lecturer) who enjoy
doing art as well as science.
We have weekly sessions in term time when we all
meet up, and with the help of our qualified teacher
Gareth, make a mess and hopefully some art along
the way.
We also have a studio at our disposal in the union
building where it’s possible to do your own thing
during the week.
Q2. WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU CALLED
LEOSOC?
Why Leonardo... this question has frustrated many
a person and the answer lies back in the years of
history that precede us, with our Forefathers, those
great people who founded L§eosoc.
They discovered, much to their dismay, that the
name “art society” had already been taken by a
bunch of unscrupulous students - these people
were not artists but appreciators of art, and can oft
be found going to the theatre together at cheaper
prices than those that mere mortals have to pay.
So our Great Forefathers were left with a
conumdrum. “What shall we call the fantastic
society we have just created?” they puzzled over
it for weeks and came up with “leonardo society”,
naming their club after Leonardo Da Vinci - a man
of both science and art such that they hoped their
followers would be....or maybe they just happened
to be in Da Vinci’s bar in the Union, who can tell?
