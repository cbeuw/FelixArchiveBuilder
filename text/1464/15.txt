W
hen
Fred-
die Ber-
rington-
Lane
was born
it was
into a very troubled existence and
it all started with the origins of his
name. His mother had been one of
the Berringtons of Somerset, an
old family that could trace its her-
itage all the way back to the Bayeux
tapestry – “Richard Berrington
has been worked into it, holding
a horse you know” – and its tyr-
anny over the farmers that worked
on the Berrington estate almost as
far. Deidre Berrington had been a
beautiful, intelligent, lively young
woman destined for great things,
until she met Archibald Lane, a
violinist with no money and no tal-
ent to speak of outside of Cornwall.
They met at a party, they danced
well into the early hours and at
dawn they fled to Dover and got a
boat to France.
The family was in uproar. Who
was this man with the common
name that their Deidre had run
away with? She had left a letter,
clearly explaining her absence and
expressing her hope that she would
see them all again soon. The fam-
ily took the letter and put it on the
fire, then wrote to the lawyers and
had her name removed from the
family tree.
So when Archie and Dee re-
turned to England they found the
door to Berrington Manor closed
firmly against them and settled in
London to a miserable marriage.
Five years later Archie left, fed up
with his wife’s ineptitude at darn-
ing socks and boiling potatoes, and
Deidre threw herself on the mercy
of an aunt who took in her and her
son, Freddie.
The next fifteen years weren’t so
bad. Deidre dropped her husband’s
name and sat quietly during after-
noon tea visits to Berrington Man-
or until slowly her parents got used
to her being around again. They
didn’t care very much for her son
though, so she continued to live
with her aunt who thoroughly en-
joyed reminding her how wickedly
she had behaved. But for Freddie,
life ran quite smoothly. He went to
boarding school and played rugby
and cricket – being a skinny boy
he wasn’t very good at either but
that never seems to concern gym
teachers. He worked very hard at
History and got a place to study at
Oxford. The family suddenly start-
ed to take an interest – it was fasci-
nating to them that a non-descript
violin-player with an unfortunate
surname could produce such an
intelligent boy. They paid his fees
and were satisfied with his grades,
but in the second year something
rather unfortunate happened.
Returning to his room late one
night after a dinner where he
may have had a little too much to
drink, he could hear a faint snuf-
fling sound coming from inside it
as he fumbled with his keys outside
the door. Cautiously he opened the
door and peeped around it to see
a piglet sitting in the middle of the
room. Slowly Freddie eased him-
self passed the door, closed it qui-
etly and surveyed the little animal
warily. He had no idea how it had
got there but dimly, in the back of
his wine-muddled brain, he was re-
calling a rule that the college had
concerning Lord Byron and a bear
– or was that at Cambridge?
Probably at Cambridge, he finally
decided, looking up at the clock on
his mantelpiece and realising that
he had been leaning against the
wall for a quarter of an hour. The
piglet, meanwhile, had dragged his
dressing-gown off a chair and was
making itself a bed. This would
never do! Freddie still had no idea
who had let the piglet loose in here,
but he knew he would have to get
rid of it and quickly if he wanted
to avoid be disciplinary hearing.
Carefully, very carefully, he crept
across the rug towards the piglet,
his arms outstretched. At the very
last minute he made a sort of dive
at the pig but perhaps not as grace-
fully as his addled brain may have
predicted because the piglet shot
between his legs, squealing unnat-
urally loudly for such a little crea-
ture and he toppled to the floor and
got tangled in his dressing-gown.
A moment later a porter was
charging through the door, his
bowler hat tilted slightly backwards
due to the speed of his movements,
and demanded to know the reason
for the disturbance. He took one
look at the piglet, one at Freddie
fighting to be free from the clutch-
es of his dressing-gown and shook
his head grimly.
The next day Freddie Berrington-
Lane was sent down from Oxford
for the disregard of the rule forbid-
ding the housing of unusual pets
in halls of residents. His great aunt
vowed that her heart would stop
with the shame, but not before it
was overcome with palpitations
at the sight of the bill that was en-
closed with the letter, demanding
that the carpet in the student room
be replaced. Freddie returned to
his aunt’s house under a very large
cloud.
Meanwhile, Lord Berrington,
Deidre’s uncle who was currently
in charge of the estate, had died,
leaving four daughters and three
grieving widows all desperate to
know who would be getting the
house. The earlier wives, not to
be at a disadvantage to the latest,
moved back into the house, refus-
ing to leave until the will was read.
The lawyer was called for and pro-
nounced Freddie Berrington-Lane
as the next male in line to receive
the estate. The wives were out-
raged. Who was this cousin that
nobody had ever heard of? Freddie
was sent for.
Freddie arrived at the manor one
grey morning and stared up at it
from the safety of the back seat of
the cab. He had never been here
before, his grandparents lived in
a smaller house a few miles away
and his grandfather’s brother had
never asked him to visit. The cab
driver asked pointedly for his fare
and Freddie knew it was time to get
out. Watching the cab drive away,
his suitcase feeling heavy in his
hands, he climbed the stairs and
knocked on the large front door.
A grim-faced butler opened it,
looked him slowly up and down,
sniffed and stood back for him to
enter. He was wearing a black arm-
band and a mournful expression
on his face. Slowly Freddie looked
around the hall: it was immense,
dimly lit and deathly quiet. For a
fleeting moment he considered
the possibility that nobody was in
but then all at once the three wives
were in the entrance hall, bearing
down on him with invitations to
breakfast and malignant looks in
their eyes.
Freddie probably wouldn’t have
lasted in the house until the end
of the day – with all the false kind-
ness, and angry looks flashed in his
direction when the wives thought
he wasn’t looking - if it hadn’t
been for Marie-Claire. She was the
daughter of the most recent wife,
who had caught Lord Berrington’s
eye in a line of chorus girls in the
West End – Marie-Claire’s moth-
er had had the longest legs. This
third wife had been living in the
manor for under a year and would
probably not have managed to
hold on to her husband for much
longer because they had very little
in common and were constantly
fighting. She was demanding and
childish and he was stubborn and
impatient; luckily for her they were
still married when the heart attack
came along. Her daughter was very
pretty, very polite and very clever.
She batted her eyes and smiled and
Freddie suddenly found himself ac-
cepting an invitation to dinner. He
stayed the rest of the week, and the
next, and finally the two divorced
wives cut their losses and went
home.
Meanwhile, Freddie and Marie-
Claire had been making plans.
They packed up their things and
got a boat to France, Freddie re-
turning to the country in which
he was conceived and Marie-
Claire visiting for the first time her
mother’s homeland. They moved
into a little cottage in the South
where Freddie immersed himself
in History books, eventually one
day publishing one of his own and
Marie-Claire’s mother remained at
the manor, deserted now of all the
servants but content in the knowl-
edge that she had beaten the other
wives for it.
