MINI DIANA
T
hese photographs were taken using a
Lomography Mini Diana, available from various
outlets including their fantastic flagship store
on Newburgh Street, the internet and Urban
"overpriced Primark" Outfitters.
Lomography specialise in re-releasing old film cameras and
the Mini Diana is their cheapest and funnest model. You can
wind the film on as far and as little as you chose, allowing for
overlapping and double exposure until your heart’s content.
It's a learning curve, but it’s fun. Also it's a camera you can
love, but not have to worry the fuck out of because of its
cost and fragility. Ever since Christmas when I got one of
these my SLR has sat in its painfully costly NASA- designed
travel bag gathering dust, while my Diana bangs around
in my backpack with my textbooks wherever I go. If my
Nikon is my fat old wife, the Diana is my 17 year old
Russian girlfriend.
At the cost of sounding like a Turkish salesman: If she
sounds right for you, check out www.lomography.com or
go to their flagship store next time you're in Soho. 
