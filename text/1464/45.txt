T
he comments from
my companions as we
reached the Old Vic Pit
Bar were ranging from
“ooh, this is a nice theatre”
to “if Jeff Goldblum is there, I’m going
to go up to him and ask him if he wants
a blowjob”. And I guess these two re-
marks sum up what the Three Lit-
tle Maids are all about charming and
nice with a naughty irreverent edge.
The bar itself is small and cute, no
more than a anteroom to the Old Vic
staircase, with some rather reasonably
priced drinks on offer (if you’re feel-
ing really posh there’s Tatty for £7.50
a glass). The crowd varies from trendy
young things to elderly theatre goers
with the odd celebrity chucked in for
good measure (Omigod it’s Neil from
the Inbetweeners!).
But to the Three Little Maids them-
selves, all look charmingly gorgeous
and well complemented by some
custom made bunting and their pi-
anist Leo. The set didn’t exactly start
with a bang but the ‘60s medley per-
formed was nice enough, including a
Lily Allen-esque rendition of I’m Into
Straight, gay and all shades in between
After getting to know the The Three Little Maids, arts editor Lucy Harrold, listens to their perfect harmonies
Something Good. The Lily Allen style
was later echoed in an untempo ar-
rangement of The Beatles “Drive My
Car” both with some effective shaky
egg and cowbell action from the girls.
Highlights of the first set included an
authentic trip back to the ‘40s with
Catagoona Choo Choo ala The An-
drews Sisters, an impromptu cameo
from Leo singing Cabaret and a very
smooth Moon River with an almost
dreamlike quality with its lilting melo-
dy. The downside with this first set for
me was the sound quality which made
it difficult to hear the Maids’ sparkling
wit and ad-libbing as well as many of
the intricate harmonies. Another is-
sue with the venue was the number of
people pushing past to get to the bar,
but again, there’s not much you can do
about this in a bar.
The second set contained my ab-
solute favourite number of the night:
Maid in the Mirror. Yes, you heard me
right; a girly take on that Michael Jack-
son classic Man in the Mirror com-
plete with impassioned hand gestures,
“If Jeff Goldblum is
here I’m going to
go up to him and
ask him if he wants
a blowjob”
a few sch-mos and he-hes and some
very impressive riffing. Also rating
highly was a rather unique version of
Sesame Street, I’d never have expected
to find a children’s TV theme tune in
a Cabaret set but it was charming and
very well done.
After a short break, the Maids were
back for their final set which took on
a more musical theatrey tone start-
ing with a few Sondheim classics- the
well performed, if slightly predictable
“Maid in the
Mirror...a girly take
on that Michael
Jackson classic”
You Could Drive a Person Crazy and
a beautiful arrangement of Send In
The Clowns. This was followed by an-
other highlight that caused most of the
crowd to burst into fits of laughter- a
well judged I Know Him So Well with
brilliant impressions of Elaine Paige
and Barbara Dickson by Kate and Jen
respectively.
The Three Little Maids definitely
stood up to their motto of Cheek
Charming Close Harmony Cabaret,
it was a fun evening filled with per-
fect harmonies and some great com-
edy moments. I’d love to see them in a
Cabaret orientated space so that their
personalities could really shine.

T
he experience of the pro-
duction – highly interac-
tive, alternating between
claustrophobia, disorien-
tating confusion and visu-
al excitement – was fantastic. Locked
inside an industrial mill-like struc-
ture containing a three-leveled stage,
the audience was subjected to vary-
ing kinds of theatric abuse: first pitch
black darkness, billowing winds and
the overbearing sound of an onrushing
train, followed by bribing us, the audi-
ence, into good humour through free
champagne and multicolored plastic
balls to throw at each other, and fin-
ishing with a group sing-along and a
House of Commons-style ruckus. RSC
it wasn’t; challenging, different and fun
it was. Continually moved around the
stage’s different levels, harassed and
provoked, our audience shifted from
severe shyness at first to keen involve-
ment by the end.
The production company Shunt have
to be praised for pursuing a change to
conventional theatre that draws a con-
crete line between audience and cast.
This sought to confuse that boundary,
forcibly bringing the audience into the
show and making them keen partici-
pants. Each show becomes different to
the last as different audiences react in
different ways. The fractured narrative
serves to confuse the audience until
they learn to adjust to it.
The play itself was not as enjoyable,
indeed it made little sense, suppos-
edly based around a financial crash
and loosely following the plot line of
a businessman first seeking start-up
capital, then relishing his success but
with much of the text cut out by the
production.
Characterisation besides this lead
role was weak and unneeded, however,
because the priority was clearly the
visual, experimentative and interactive
aspect of the show, based in what ap-
peared to be a giant industrial revolu-
tion-era contraption.
A twisted, mute monster moved
freely around the various levels of the
stage, an Orthodox Jewish family lived
in the bottom stage next door to a
steam room, plastic balls fall from the
sky, it doesn’t make much sense, but
was bloody fun nonetheless.

S
peculation, why it is the one
inducement we have to live…
why on earth would you have
me loosen my purse strings
and risk my fortune, if you do
not promise me some extraordinary en-
joyment, some sudden happiness which
will open heaven to me?
Poignant words. Especially in 2010
when we are still smarting from the
collapse of a certain banking establish-
ment and all its ensuing economic and
monetary chaos.
Words that would have also been
said with a sense of irony following the
collapse of the Union Genèrale’s on the
Paris Bourse in 1882. A fiasco that pre-
cipitated a recession that lasted well
into the following decade.
It is the downfall of this financial in-
stitution which inspired Emile Zola’s
1891 novel L’Argent, which in turn
inspired Shunt Theatre to create their
own abstract interpretation, Money.
Located in an old tobacco ware-
house just a hop over the river from
London’s own financial district, the
Shunt Collective treat us to theatre as
we have never experienced before. A
huge three-storey box, stairs climbing
its visible side, stands industrial and
threatening in the warehouse space.
Quite a contrast to the scene before it
where the audience sit by the bar un-
der fairy lights, at tables and chairs, as
ushers wearing riot helmets stoically
give out coloured balloons. Moments
later the balloons are snatched back
and we are forced out of our seats, up
the iron stairs and into the pitch black
box itself.
For the next ninety minutes the cast
of six baffle us, astound us and even
sometimes scare us with their random
take on Zola’s story.
Neur, his girlfriend, the steam room
guy and the spooky, painted and half-
naked acrobat that inhabits the raft-
ers invite the audience in to answer
back, participate (if brave enough) and
to even throw balls at them. You will
not have seen a play in which you are
relocated upstairs after half an hour
to watch the action two floors below
through Perspex floors. You will have
not been served champagne mid-show
either, or sung along to Randy New-
man, karaoke style. And nor will you
have had a Willy Wonka’s factory ex-
perience where the ‘vessel’ you reside
in ejects steam, blows air and reverber-
ates all around you. Nor is it likely that
you will ever witness a play that un-
folds around, above and below you… at
least for quite some time.
Money is virtually unfathomable
for the most part. But for all the pain,
adrenaline and fear inflicted on our
senses: who cares!
