Imperial students who form the Rac-
ing Green Endurance (RGE) team
have successfully driven a modified
electric sports car around the M25
twice on a single charge, breaking
the prior record set by the Tesla last
year.
The RGE team drove the first lap at
55mph using 42% of the total energy
stored and drove the second lap at
60mph. The car, a specially modified
electric supercar called the SRzero, is
based on a chassis and body from the
SR8 by Radical Sportscars. It sports
two lightweight motors designed and
built by EVO Electrics - an Imperial
company. The 1100kg SRzero has a
top speed of 200km/h, can accelerate
from 0-100km/h in 7 seconds and is
capable of fully charging its 56kWh
battery from Thundersky in just 6
hours.
Imperial‚Äôs RGE team testing the
SRzero against the M25 is part of
their build-up to an attempt to drive
through the 26,000km Pan-American
Highway in July. Commenting on the
M25 test, Imperial said that ‚Äò‚Äôpart of
the project will help assess the per-
formance and endurance capabilities
of electric vehicles over long dis-
tances. We also hope that driving the
car across two continents will raise
awareness along the way about the
benefits of electric vehicles and dispel
the public perception of electric cars
as slow and unattractive, with a lim-
ited range.‚Äô‚Äô
The move is a step forward for elec-
tric cars, following the unprecedented
performance of the Tesla Roadster
which additionally travelled 313 miles
on a single charge and was featured
on Top Gear. With the twin motors
of the SRzero tuned for endurance
rather than performance, Imperial
said ‚Äò‚Äôit has an average running cost of
one penny per mile and a range of ap-
proximately 400km before the battery
needs recharging.‚Äô‚Äô
The project is part of the Energy
Futures Lab, Imperial‚Äôs sector for en-
ergy research. Director of the Energy
Futures Lab, Professor Nigel Brandon,
said that ‚Äò‚Äôapart from being great fun,
we hope that the Racing Green Endur-
ance project will show the world the

Imperial Supercar breaks record
leaps and bounds that electric vehi-
cles are making‚Äô‚Äô and that ‚Äò‚Äôthis project
is also helping the next generation of
UK engineers to gain valuable expe-
rience in the field, which is vital for
their careers and the future of British
manufacturing.‚Äô‚Äô
The Imperial team will embark
on their 26,000km journey from the
northern tip of Alaska to the south-
ern tip of South America through 14
countries in July.
Former Sabb tells students in
need of welfare to ‚Äúlearn to
speak for yourself‚Äù
Christian Carter‚Äôs statement in full:
‚ÄúThe university will always need stu-
dent representation for those students
who can‚Äôt speak for themselves. For
those students who aren‚Äôt morons then
the sabbatical officers are a waste of
time. As a student, ask yourself this
question. Have you ever needed the
help of a sabbatical officer? If the an-
swer is yes, and it was for Welfare or
Educational purposes then I feel sorry
for you and you should learn to speak
for yourself and challenge your depart-
ment. If it was for a club or society
related issue then your answer could
probably be answered by a member of
staff. If it was for any other reason then
you are a proper hack and probably
need psychiatric attention.

F
ormer Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services) Christian
Carter was asked to give his
views on whether students run
for Sabbatical positions out of passion
for student issues or a cynical desire to
fluff up their CVs. Instead he suggest-
ed that student officers only exist for
students who ‚Äúcan‚Äôt speak for them-
selves‚Äù and ridiculed students who re-
quire welfare or educational support.
