LIFE THROUGH THE LENS 32 33 34
I digress.
As my night comes to an end, I look back at all the
people I had met that night; still drunk off their, by
now at least, horribly dredged lipstick, smudged
mascara and sweaty-perfumed head. Despite not
having anybody I knew tag along with me, I had
still had one of those nights in the areole of my life’s
most memorable nights. As a photographer. Life
through then lens, eh? Not bad. Not bad at all. 
From the distance, I spotted somebody else armed
with an SLR; as soon as I had spotted their body
and lens, I immediately became protective. Any
photographer who claims he has never suffered
from the hideous ailment known only as lens-envy
or lens-lust is a liar. I looked down pitifully at Alyona
, giving her a timid pat. She has been with me years,
and that’s time no camera can replace.
