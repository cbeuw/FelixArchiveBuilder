There was a student from Imperial
Whose failure with women was serial
Try as he might
They always took flight
So he got his thrills from his course material

IMPERIAL RULE
COLLEGE
A College to my name, nothing to my heart,
Though grass greener, consider stone pave warmer.
Whilst the turbines of my mind speed faster than I can think,
The pressures, the thoughts and the people fade fast.
Passing nausea hides away behind a moment’s blink.
In between the turbulence I find a solace.
Monday’s blank canvas stays still in the winds,
Whilst Friday’s paper whistles across the mile,
A mile by mile, a square of Smoke where my livelihoods lie.
That patch a comfort, my pawns to play,
Competition is leadless, but fruitless at best.
As the strings are pulled and my show is made,
I look beyond this garden where my seeds are sown
To the weeds of height unimaginable.
Yet I know amongst selfish nature
Lay delicate flowers, ones there, there and there.
Like those that have risen East and those that have risen near
And the ones that are soon to cease.
They all flaunt and flutter in breezes,
But in breezes only ever found by me.
