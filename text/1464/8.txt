PHOENIX 8
‘Redditch’, photographed by Andy Roast
When an old person dies,
They say a baby is born.
See grief leads to joy,
So don’t look so forlorn.
But Eastbourne is peculiar,
Or that’s how it’s sold.
It’s full of grey care homes,
Which are full of the old.
And death isn’t lazy,
He works every day.
So where are the babies?
Do they all move away?
