IMPERIAL RULE
IMPERIAL RULE
This is your home. From the mini heatwave that is the library to the 1960sâ€™ unwanted
baby that is the Blackett Laboratory, this is your home whether you like it or not.
Recreational societies have been the mainstay of arts on campus, and it is from them
that most of the contributions in this feature are sourced. Through these, PHOENIX
looks to celebrate all the love and lackings Imperial College has flagrantly tossed our
way these past years.
