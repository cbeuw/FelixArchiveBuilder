PAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE
had the chance, I’m sorry for be-
ing so self-absorbed, I’m sorry for
crashing the car into your sister’s
garage…”
In 1997, I drove the car at thirty-
five miles per hour into her sister’s
garage door and then punched her
sister’s husband for not letting me
see Joni. He punched me back, of
course, and was stronger than me
so I fell down cold. It made local
news, apparently, but they didn’t
use any names. I woke up in the
hospital, and didn’t get out for five
months, until NASA’s PR depart-
ment-employed psychiatrist certi-
fied me fit to leave.
“Okay, Paul,” Joni says. “We can
meet for lunch – tomorrow.”
Her sister groans in the back-
ground, “Joni...!” and Joni sighs be-
fore she hangs up the phone.
*
Paul comes back numb. He doesn’t
burn up on re-entry; he doesn’t
suffer any gravity sickness. He hugs
his parents, kisses Joni and holds
his daughter.
“You seem different to me,” he
says to his wife.
“So do you,” she says, but Paul
doesn’t feel very different. The only
thing that has really changed about
Paul is that he doesn’t talk about
space anymore.
It takes two weeks for him to
stop assigning every colour he sees
a name from the Dulux range (the
front lawn was Green Parrot; So-
phie’s eyes were Liberty Blue). It
takes three weeks for him to realise
that Joni had slept with someone
else.
It all comes out one evening, a
few months since he’s known, and
Joni breaks down crying after din-
ner, telling him how sorry she is,
how she wishes it had never hap-
pened and how none of it meant
a thing. Paul says nothing, doesn’t
know what to say. As far as he’s
concerned, this is not a surprise,
nor was it particularly upsetting.
“How can you be so cold?” Joni
sobs.
He considers this for a moment
but cannot find an answer. Joni
wears a different shade of lipstick
these days. She has new clothes in
the wardrobe he’s never seen her
wear, there’s new furniture in the
living room, different paintings on
the wall. It wasn’t just the one-time
affair that struck Paul upon com-
ing home, it was like some other
thing had moved in to take his
place during his absence and So-
phie had gotten taller, and Joni had
cut her hair.
One night, Joni leans over to him
in bed and says, “You never talk
about space anymore.”
“Well, I’ve been there now,” he
says.
“Okay then.” And Joni’s voice
is edged with spite, “So where to
now, Paul?”
On Mir, they never turn the
lights off because someone is al-
ways working. On Mir, you get
used to wearing eye-masks when
you crawl into your sleeping bag.
On Mir, you have to strap yourself
down just to take a piss.
One night, Paul walks up to
Joni as she’s washing up at the
kitchen sink and holds her face in
his hands. He studies her features
carefully, dispassionately, and she
doesn’t move at all.
“There’s a thing about space,” he
begins in a slow and precise voice.
“It seems so beautiful, until you ac-
tually get there.”
In the month after that, Joni
packs and takes Sophie to her
sister’s.
“We still have the appointment
with Dr. Gould, if you want to
go,” she says over the phone. Paul
stands in front of the half-empty
wardrobe and shrugs.
“Sure,” he says. “Shall I pick you
up?”
“Jesus Christ, Paul.”
After their last appointment
with the counsellor, Paul is sitting
alone in their living room when
he catches the end segment on the
news. The news anchor announces
the safe arrival of Dennis Buller
from his one-hundred-and-fifty
day stint on Mir, and the brief clip
shows him grinning, waving and
kissing his wife. Then Frank calls,
“Hey, Paul – I heard about Joni,”
he says. There’s static on the phone
line; his voice fuzzes and crackles.
“What are you going to do?”
Paul starts drinking, and then
gets into the second-hand car that
his father had given him (colour:
Volcanic Splash) to drive to Joni’s
sister’s. Of the things that Paul
wishes he did and did not do, this
is always the first one in the latter
category.
*
Denny calls and says, “Be nice, man
– don’t do anything stupid, just be
nice.”
“That’s good advice,” I say. “I’m
glad you called.”
“What are you going to lead
with?”
I don’t really know as yet, and
she’s already booked a table for
tomorrow.
More than once, when I was in
the hospital, I wished I had actually
written one of Denny’s in-case-of-
death letters and burnt up coming
home. That way I could’ve written
myself as I wanted to be remem-
bered, and would have saved all of
this. I could’ve said to Joni: this is
how I want you to remember me –
and omitted all of the unfavourable
parts.
I would’ve said to not remember
me yelling when Denny was offered
STS-75. Try not to think about
how many times I’ve promised to
do the things I never intended to
do. Please do not remember me as
selfish and callous, but bold and
passionate.
I could have said, Joni – this is
how I want you to remember me.
Remember that you met me after
work and I kissed you for the first
time in the parking lot. Remember
that we rode our bikes around town
on the day we moved to Texas, re-
member that the sky was full of sun
and that the neighbourhood lawn
sprinklers kissed our heels as we
sped past. Remember that Sophie
has my hair, and my nose, even if
she has your eyes. Remember that
I remembered these things before
anything else, as though they were
the most vital things in my life.
“I think I might start by apologis-
ing again, and take it from there,” I
tell Denny. “Maybe not.”
“Just don’t do anything stupid,”
he says. “Listen, Paul, good luck,
but I’ve got to go; I’m training for
the ISS.”
When he hangs up the phone, I
sit back and think about, consider-
ing how much of my life I’ve spent
working towards it, how strange it
is that I can’t imagine going back.
An elderly lady who lives a few
doors down – far enough to have
never heard me and Joni yelling at
each other – has told me about her
grandson, a nine-year old kid in
Washington who’s dreamt of space
all his life. She’s asked me for ad-
vice and I don’t know what to say.
I remember what it was like; for
her seventh birthday I’ve bought
Sophie a bicycle and I’m planning
on taking her and Joni up Hoosier
Hill next winter solstice to see the
constellations and the shooting
stars. I remember what it was like
to strive for something so magnifi-
cent and unreachable, you never
really quite believe yourself. But I
also remember one hundred and
forty-eight days of looking at the
earth like a blue-green marble on
the tarmac, where my daughter
was growing up, where my brother
was learning the family business,
where my wife was sleeping with
a grocery store stranger. I don’t
know what I’d say to this lady’s
grandson, picturing John Glenn in
front of the stars and stripes, pic-
turing Henry Duke typing unhap-
py articles that no-one will read.
I’m thinking about Denny, still set
on the International Space Station,
never disappointed. I’m thinking
about teaching Sophie to ride a bike
one day. Most of all, I’m thinking
about lunch with Joni and whether
she’ll be as indecisive as ever with
her meal order, and whether she’ll
ever take me back. This is the dif-
ference, I realise, in what you will
leave and what you will want back.
If they called me tomorrow, and
asked me to go back up to the ISS
right away, I’d probably say thanks,
but no thanks. I’d probably say,
sorry, but I’m meeting my wife for
lunch tomorrow, and I’m still try-
ing to find some better words.
More than once, when I was in the hospital, I
wished I had actually written one of Denny’s in-
case-of-death letters and burnt up coming home.
That way I could’ve written myself as I wanted to
be remembered, and would have saved all of this.
