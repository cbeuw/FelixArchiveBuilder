‘Would You Go Back?’, by Chrisopher Allan
I dreamt I was in love with you again.
How my heart raced at your exquisite touch
upon my arm, my hand; at how you then
guided my brush to paint, with strokes of such
delight that each caress the canvas felt
I also knew, fantastic flights of fancy.
Emotion, colour, touch, sound seem to melt
into this light I feel and song I can see.
Aroused from sleep, the dream retreats from mind;
Cold morning air dispels its heady mist.
Alone, I try to catch it, but I find
no grip can grasp that which does not exist.
Why did I chase so long what now it seems
are fleeting images and fading dreams?

SONNET NO.2
Five Thirty Six.
Discordant chromatic scales wake me.
Song Birds’ tune bounces off
The breeze block grey.
Five Thirty Seven.
Bacon tugs at my nasal hairs,
Seducing the plate with acrimonious oil,
Beckoning the night.
Eight Twelve.
‘You are in the storm, waves lapping about you,
Sinking, sinking in the saffron sea!’
God deals in punctured lifejackets;
can you pass me the mayonnaise?
‘He shall save you!’
I hear it is pleasant to drown;
you are blocking the canned chopped tomatoes.
‘He Shall Save You!’
I prefer to spend.
Nine Sixty minus Two.
Eliot in my pocket,
Blake in my socket.
Ten Forty Four.
With mould and stick,
She cherry pick.
A boy breaks a branch, crushes a stone.
Wind Stops,
Air does not flow,
Whispers do not gather.
Souls meet; Wisdom past.
The broken branch rotten, trodden.
With mould and stick,
He cherry pick.
Twelve Eighteen.
I call her Matilda,
Even if that is not her name.
Sandwiches and shortbread
Are the custodians of the bench
Keeping us far,
Holding us close.
Fifteen Zero Three
I call her Jessica,
Even if that is not her name.
Bicycle lamp cello taped to the handlebars,
Afternoon haze upon my back,
Tickling my leg hair,
Afternoon haze upon my mind,
Setting me loose amongst the fair
In the Bakelite café
Noiselessness echoing across the deserted table.
Eighteen Twelve.
I call her Sophie,
Even if that is not her name.
That is her name,
Lion with thick dark mane,
Nothing about her plain.
Rhubarb stuck to my chin,
Custard drying under my fingernails,
Waiting for soap.
Twenty One Twenty One.
Creased cotton sheets listen to the street,
Uneven feather pillows speak to the window,
Ajar
Lies the door.
She wasn’t a whore.
Five Thirty Six.
No birdsong.
No Bacon.
I call them Sophie.
