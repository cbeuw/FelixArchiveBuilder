Backstage at Wembley with John Mayer
So John Mayer might be an interna-
tional, ex-Jennifer Aniston screwing,
rock superstar and that does give him
some right not to care about budding
London musicians, however he defied
stereotype and was generous enough
to add a couple of names to his guest-
list at Wembley Arena last week. Beats
paying the 50-odd quid to hear him
whine about sleeping with a broken
heart… don’t worry Mr. Mayer, there
are plenty more Ms. Aniston’s in this
world.
Arriving at Wembley, while the sun
was still shining, was a change. The
support act, which was the charm-

I’ve got a deal for you guys, if you can get Barry White to number 1 next week, I’ll
do something unfathomably embarrassing; I’m open to suggestions on the group
wall. Barry White. Number 1. YES WE CAN! - Kadhim
ing Ellie Goulding, was just about to
take to the stage for her largest, prob-
ably most terrifying support gig. She
valiantly beat her drum and sang her
siren pop songs to a largely uninter-
ested, half-filled arena. Feeling slightly
sorry for her, I overexerted myself in
support. Her sound was huge, her
band was tight and the songs flowed
out as if she was a Wembley veteran.
Admittedly, with that kind of power
coming from the enormous stacks,
which hung from the ceiling, it’s hard
not to sound overwhelming, but Ellie
came through convincingly. Sweetly
thanking the crowd she humbly left
the stage to give way to the force that
might be John Mayer.
Swiftly making our way to congratu-
late Ellie and see the action behind the
scenes, we thought it was time to grill
Mr. Mayer. Through a weave of de-
serted corridors and dressing rooms
we came across life. A hub of crew
all kitted out with torches and radios,
musicians a-plenty, security a-leaping
and a partridge in a pear tree. Despite
some misconceptions, backstage is not
the drug-fuelled eternal party some
may think and there was definitely
no partridge, there was, however, a
certain American guitarist. Being his
first time playing in Wembley, John’s
nerves must be giving him some kind
of grief but he didn’t let on; cool as ice
he described the venue as “The Madi-
son Square Garden of the UK”, this is
probably true but certainly not on the
aesthetic front. He towered above all
of us and made little effort to break
the ice (fair enough when he’s about to
have to break the ice with about 6,000
adoring fans, he needed all the lines he
could get).
From this encounter I learned that
he was not going on stage with Pino
Palladino (bassist) or Steve Jordan
(drummer), from his ‘Try’ and ‘Where
the Light Is – Live in LA’, blues trio al-
bums. This left me massively disheart-
ened as to be honest that is the only
reason I thought he was any good to
begin with. Instead he would be play-
ing his soppy love songs. Despite my
best efforts I could not get anything
out of him about what it’s like to be
in bed with Jennifer Aniston. He was
whisked away from us to prepare and
Ellie had just cooled off from her set.
Giving our love and congratulations to
her, we took our places to see the man.
There’s no question that John Mayer
has stage presence, and as he plucked
his way through the first few numbers,
the largely female crowd showed no
sign of stopping the relentless scream-
ing and love-struck wailing that seems
to follow John. He had a tremendous
band that communicated perfectly and
kept the wall of sound, behind John’s
intricate solos, flawless, huge and as
tight as they could be. There were
moments where the backing singers
had something not quite right but it
quite clearly made little difference to
the spectacular sound that was com-
ing from the stage. Reeling off many of
the hit songs that the girls could easily
sing along to while lusting after him,
the experience was beginning to get a
little painful, as I knew that there was
far more talent on that stage than was
being shown. I clearly spoke too soon
as he then erupted into some tearing
blues riffs and squealing solos that
gave me a taste of the John Mayer I had
come to know. There were some ques-
tionable movements by John, looking
as though he was getting a bit more
pleasure from his guitar than his guitar
was willing to give, but the skill was on
another level.
There was a constant theme of him
having quite long, one-sided conver-
sations with the crowd that seemed
to me like he enjoyed the sound of his
own voice a bit too much. This view
of him that I had formed was com-
pletely redeemed with a little dedica-
tion from him to us, our desire to see
his blues trio music mentioned back-
stage must have left an impression on
him. Sending his band off and taking
the stage on his own, he proceeded to
play my favorite blues song of his. We
were amazed at what he had just done,
in a sold-out Wembley arena. With a
glance and a nod, he brought his band
back onstage, and fell comfortably
back into his pop songs, he had done
enough, he was superb.
Having played for nearly two hours
and having left the stage, he returned
for a humble encore, as the applause
was never ending. All in all it was a
dynamic set, with perfect sound and
glimmers of blues excellence, inter-
twined with slightly generic love songs
and hiccups. It cannot be denied that
he writes beautiful music and is a living
guitar legend, despite his skills not ful-
ly manifesting themselves this evening,
they do exist and he left everybody
wanting more, well-done Mr. Mayer.
He towered above
all of us and made
little effort to
break the ice, (fair
enough when he’s
about to have
to break the ice
with about 6,000
adoring fans, he
needed all the lines
he could get.)
Reviews
Jack White takes more of a backseat
than ever before, bringing Alison
Mosshart to the helm of this spooky
yet sultry blues outfit. The album
kicks off with “Blue Blood Blues”; with
bass stomping all over it and Fertita’s
guitar shrieking in discordant yelps.
WTF ‘shake your hips like battleships’
means I’m not quite qualified to say, all
I know is, it moves my bones. “Hustle
and Cuss” sees them slip into a more
chilled groove akin to 70s soul band
Funkadelic, which contrasts with the

For more than a decade now Au-
techre’s works have tended to be tough
to approach. Indeed this duo of pro-
grammers didn’t wait for the Year 2000
to issue their vision of the music of
the third millennium: cold and diso-
rienting rhythm sections interwoven
with, sometimes, harrowing ambient
sounds (noises?). Yet, even if “Over-
steps” still fits this description, this
new release does not require a hun-

dred listens like the previous records
to be appreciated. It is much more
based upon atmospheres and melodies
(“r ess”, “d-sho qub”) and the dementia
of their rhythm machine seems to be
almost cured despite one or two re-
lapses (“qplay”). As a simple and very
coherent album “Oversteps” is a good
surprise in a kind where showing off
over-complexity reigns.
- Flavian Vansyngel
twisting snake-like “The Difference
Between Us” driven by Fertita’s Ham-
mond organ and Lawrence’s bassline.
It’s notable that this album is a more
collaborative effort than their first al-
bum, with White restricted to the odd
burst of showmanship, like his distinc-
tive guitar solo on “Gasoline”. Whilst
several tracks feel unrefined and in
need of trimming, the overall result is
impressive, and serious kudos to them
for finishing on a jaunty graveyard
theme. - Tom Jennings
If I had the choice, I’d probably have him instead of Jennifer Aniston...
