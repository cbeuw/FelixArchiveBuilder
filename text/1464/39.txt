Are Sabbs interested in helping
students or furthering their careers?
Matt Colvin finds out what motivates student officers and interviews rivals Alexander Dahinten and Chris Darby
T
his year’s Sabbatical
Elections left many
questioning the
intentions of Sabbatical
Officers following the
withdrawal of two candidates – from
the same position. Ben Stubbens stood
down during the election for Deputy
President (Education) after accepting
a work offer from Rolls-Royce and
Meera Ganeshadevan withdrew, after
having been elected into the position,
in order to work for Credit Suisse.
Naturally, questions have been raised
regarding the intent of those who
stand for paid positions in the Union.
Do Sabbatical Officers really have the
best interests of the student body at
heart or are they in it to further their
own prospective careers? Is it even
that simple? felix was able to speak to
the newly-elected Deputy President
(Education), Alex Dahinten, on the
issues surrounding Sabbatical positions.
felix: With the recent departure of in-
dividuals to take up work placements
rather than contest positions in the
Union, do you believe that those who
stand for Sabbatical Elections have
the best interests of the Union and
university in mind or are they only
aiming for an extension to their CV?
AD: Having an election this late in
the year naturally invites this ques-
of running, however at the time I had
plans to go travelling for a year. Once
the elections passed, I began to regret
my decision and therefore when I heard
that Meera stepped down I felt it was
the right decision to make.
felix: If you were in the same posi-
tion as those who left for work place-
ments, how would you consider the
issue?
AD: It’s a difficult choice to make, since
you do always want the security of hav-
ing a fall-back plan.
However by not letting the students
know that you are totally behind your
campaign, you are deceiving them. I
ran because I am 100% committed, so
as far as I’m concerned I will be starting
on the 1st of July (unless of course I get
an internship offer from Credit Suisse!).
Chris Darby is Equal Opportunities
Officer in the Union and newly elected
Academic Affairs Officer for CGCU.
Having stood for both Union President
and Deputy President (Education) this
year, felix spoke to him in order to de-
termine his reasons for attempting to
become a Sabbatical Officer twice in
the same year.
Regarding running for the presiden-
cy, Darby explains that, “After the posi-
tive change I made as Equal Opportu-
nities Officer, the Union suggested I
run for it.” In addition to this, he has
clear views on what a Union President
should be capable of achieving: “If the
President is in a position of supporting
welfare well and is able to take more of
a management role, then that’s a good
Chris Darby: selfless servant or self-serving?
thing.” Welfare and education are im-
portant yet “neglected” issues accord-
ing to Darby; he believes that there are
instead “other priorities” current Sab-
batical Officers are too focussed on.
As an example, he finds fault with the
Union’s handling of February’s ‘One
World Week’, simply stating that “no-
body knew about it”.
With regards to then standing for
Deputy President (Education), Darby
explains it as a natural progression,
stating that he had “support from peo-
ple like Ben (Stubbens)”. Discussing
Meera Ganeshadevan’s departure, he
feels that “(Meera’s) heart wasn’t in it”,
yet acknowledges the “difficult situ-
ations” that those who left for place-
ments found themselves in. Concern-
ing Alex Dahinten’s running for the
position, he is far more praisewor-
thy, suggesting that, “his reasons (for
standing) were much more sincere”.
Darby is clearly passionate about the
Union and the state of welfare across
college, and whereas some may see
standing for multiple positions in the
Union as an individual merely attempt-
ing to further themselves, in this case,
the answers seem to suggest otherwise.
“The Union
suggested I run for
President”
tion. Many people at Imperial gener-
ally think that getting involved in the
Union is a CV-filler, however once you
are involved, it’s pretty clear that it is a
lot more than that. If you are willing to
spend a whole year of your life doing a
job which you do not like or feel you
will be any good at, then why run? Even
though it is paid, the prospect of being
accountable by the whole student body
should put off the “CV-fillers”.
For this election, I feel that all of the
candidates were sincere, and had the
Union’s interests placed before theirs. I
can’t recall anything similar happening
in the past years.
felix: What led you to run for the po-
sition now instead of earlier in the
year?
AD: During the first elections, I thought
Alexander Dahinten
was recently elected
as Deputy President
(Education) after a
close contest with
defeated Presidental
candidate Chris
Darby.
Mustafa Arif – Union President
2003-2005
“All the sabbaticals I’ve known have
been motivated by the best of in-
tentions, not for CV points. I turned
down a couple of well-paid job of-
fers when I stood for election in 2003
(and again when I stood for re-elec-
tion in 2004). The same was true of
other colleagues.”
Jenny Morgan – Union President
2008-2009
“I believe that the vast majority of
people who stand for election have
very good intentions. To be good
enough to be elected as a sabb it is
highly likely you have racked up an
enormous amount of experience
within the Union and therefore know
what you’re getting into, and feel
strongly about issues you want to
change.”
Hannah Theodorou - DP Education
& Welfare 2008-2009
“Ultimately there are more valuable
opportunities out there - I think it is
very rare for people to do it solely for
CV purposes. If they did, they would
find the job very frustrating and will
get little out of it - it’s reflected in
their work and the effect can be de-
moralising for the people they work
with.”
Chris Larvin – DP Finance & Services
2007-2008
“There are many different motiva-
tions or types of people who stand
for election, and it is usually split
between people that know what
they’re doing and people who don’t.
There are better ways of enhancing
your CV!”
Former Sabbs deny running for
election to fatten their CVs
Meera Ganeshadevan and Ben
Stubbens both withdrew after
receiving job offers
