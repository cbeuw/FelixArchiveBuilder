with our relationship. I remember
that she said things about her af-
fair, my absence, my unresponsive-
ness. They both mentioned my
childhood, which I thought was
slightly strange and intrusive, but
I didn’t say anything – I couldn’t
stop staring at the wall.
The therapist stopped Joni, final-
ly, turned to me and asked: “What
do you think about that, Paul?”
“When I was on Mir,” I began and
Joni leant forwards. “One of the
Russian guys – he’d already been
there a while when we arrived –
asked us to bring up a book of
paint swatches because there’s al-
most nothing there that isn’t black
or white. He’d spend whole hours
after work, flicking through this
big, glossy Dulux paint book, gaz-
ing at the colours.”
The therapist nodded and fur-
thered, gently: “How did you feel
about that, Paul?”
I glanced at her, shrugged my
shoulders. “Oh, it was okay.” I ges-
tured to her purple emulsion office
walls. “These walls – Amethyst
Falls, right?”
Joni listed more things she didn’t
like about me until our appoint-
ment was over.
“I think I’ll take the bus back,” she
said to me, when we were leaving. I
didn’t try to stop her and she didn’t
come home. We didn’t go to coun-
selling after that.

Paul buys Joni a white-gold ring
and they move together to Houston
when he’s accepted into the candi-
dacy training program at the Lyn-
don B. Johnson Space Centre. In the
program, Paul makes friends with
Denny Buller – a native to Texas,
who jokes about never leaving the
state except once, to travel for two
days and two hundred miles straight
up. Denny Buller and his wife Karen
invite Paul and Joni around for bar-
beques at the weekend. Joni gets a
job teaching drama at the local el-
ementary school but quits in 1994
to have their first child, a girl, called
Sophie. Paul buys Joni a pair of dia-
mond earrings, buys Sophie a crib
and begins training for STS-75 to
Mir, estimated launch date: Febru-
ary 17th, 1996.
Physics is not enough for the
PAUL GARTON GOES TO SPACE
Johnson Space Centre, and Paul
brings home colossal textbooks
with reams of diagrams and fine-
print on microbiology, chemistry
and materials science.
“At least you’ll be fit!” jokes the
librarian, but Paul ups his running
to five miles a day, just in case.
“I’m sick of this, Paul,” Joni yells.
“All you ever do is read and run.”
She slams the door when she takes
Sophie to the park but she comes
home later, kisses him and says,
“I’m sorry – I know how much this
means to you.”
“I’ll try to be better,” Paul prom-
ises. He calls her from work when
he’s going to be late; he tells her
he loves her. Sophie learns how
to walk and talk. Paul learns how
zero-gravity effects regulatory pro-
teins in bacterial gene expression,
but Denny thinks faster, can run
for longer and he gets the place-
ment to join the three Russian cos-
monauts out on Mir.
“I’ll catch the next one,” Paul jokes
at Denny’s weekend barbeque but
drinks a bit too much and yells at
Joni in the kitchen when they get
home.
The next weekend, Paul leaves
Sophie with his parents, and takes
Joni to New York. They see her fa-
vourite show on Broadway and he
pulls her close to him in the hotel
bed.
“I’m sorry,” he tells her. “I know
that I’ve been difficult, recently.”
Neither of them can imagine,
then, Paul wrecking the family car
in April 1997, or Joni packing a
suitcase and moving to her sister’s.
This is still January, 1996. Whilst
they are in New York, Denny’s
wife, Karen catches measles from
her nephew; Denny is quarantined
for three weeks and the director of
the Johnson Space Centre replaces
him with Paul on STS-75.
“I’ll catch the next one,” Denny
jokes on the phone to Paul, and
he brings his wife cups of tea until
she’s well. Paul still reads and runs
and goes to work, but he’s crossing
off days on the calendar like kids
counting down to Christmas and
pointing out Orion to Sophie in the
middle of the night.

I’m trying hard, these days, to fig-
ure out how I could have gotten
things so wrong. I’ve retraced my
steps to Hoosier Hill on the winter
solstice and visited the house Hen-
ry Duke used to live in. I even tried
to get an appointment to see John
Glenn last month, but ended up
sitting in an uncomfortable chair
in his offices for two hours, star-
ing at a huge framed photograph
of a young John Glenn posing,
helmet under arm, in front of the
American flag. I’m trying to decide
whether I will be Henry Duke, di-
vorced and angry, or John Glenn,
polished and proud.
In spring, on Thursday the 22nd
of March, the space station Mir
was officially de-orbited. It re-en-
tered the atmosphere in the early
hours of Friday morning, breaking
apart over the South Pacific. It had
been whole when I was there, and
made of aluminium – not acrylic
– but that was then, and Sophie
turns seven next week, so I’m try-
ing hard.
Since coming out of the hospi-
tal, I’ve been going to visit Denny,
still in Texas, still firing up the bar-
beque at the weekend, and we talk
things over.
“I don’t get it, Paul,” he says, flip-
ping burgers in the sun. “But I don’t
think you’re nuts. Did something
happen to you up there?”
“No, nothing happened at all,” I
say, and it’s the truth. NASA’s psy-
chiatrist visited the hospital and
spent some time with me, trying
to assess whether or not I was plot-
ting a lawsuit or something. The
guy in the bed next to me urged me
to sue, told me about Henry Duke,
and told me I had a really good
case. He’s probably still there.
“I’m going to go and say sorry to
Joni,” I tell him.
He nods wisely, flattens the red
meat on the grill. “Sure, that’s a
good idea – but you need to know
what you’re saying sorry first,” he
says. “Because she’ll ask you and if
you don’t have an answer… Well,
boy, does it drive Karen crazy.”
But Karen still answers the phone
when he calls.
“I didn’t total my car and check
into the loony bin, Paul,” Denny
says. “You figure out why you’re
sorry.”
So I’m trying to figure that out,
because Sophie will be seven next
week and her father is still mak-
ing appointments with John Glenn
and her mother still won’t answer
the phone when I call.

There is a large portrait of Lyndon
B. Johnson’s face, jowly and stern,
in the lobby at the Johnson Space
Centre. Sophie points at it when
she goes in, holding tightly to her
mother’s hand, but only because
it’s big – she doesn’t recognise
the face. She might’ve recognised
John F. Kennedy’s face, Johnson’s
popular predecessor, but Kennedy
wasn’t from the Lone Star State
and Texas re-christened the space
centre in their son’s name after the
third heart attack claimed him.
“Good luck, buddy,” Denny says
and embraces his friend in 1996.
“You’re not mad, are you?” Paul
asks.
“Not mad, no. Maybe a little dis-
appointed,” says Denny. “I thought
I was all set, ready to go. I wrote my
letter and everything.”
“Letter?”
“Sure, you know – I wrote a letter
for Karen and for my folks, in case
anything happened to me. So they
can remember me.”
Paul raises an eyebrow. “That
sounds a little grim for you, Denny.”
Denny only laughs. “I just like
things the way I like ‘em.” He slaps
Paul on the shoulder. “Go make
sure everything’s ready for my ar-
rival up there, won’t you?”
Paul doesn’t write a letter, and
doesn’t need one. Joni tells So-
phie to wave at the window and
she watches with tears in her eyes
when he takes off. Paul’s parents
are there, too, and Frank.
Among the things Paul takes with
him, he has photographs, the book
of paint swatches and a Creedence
Clearwater Revival CD. Once, Paul
Garton’s father had driven him –
not Frank – out to the Veterans
Memorial Park, and told him that
there were some days when he
wished he’d only ever sold second-
hand cars.
Paul makes a two day and two-
hundred mile journey as the only
American astronaut joining a team
of three Russian cosmonauts who
are still building and rebuilding
the thing. They speak limited Eng-
lish to him and perform tethered
spacewalks to maintain the space
station. Paul’s been assigned the
task of eight biomechanical ex-
periments and all are ultimately
inconclusive.
“I’m kind of sick of this,” Paul says
to the paint-swatch Russian, one
hundred and seventeen days in.
“NASA will send another soon,”
says the Russian as some form of
consolation. Paul makes a weak
joke about putting an ad in USA
Today for a Mir roommate to take
his place.
“Probably non-smoker, right?”
Paul says. The Russian smiles a
little but says nothing. He holds
a swatch up to Paul, taps a green
square called Willow Creek and
gives him a thumbs-up.
“This one is good,” the
Russian asserts.
In the one hundred and forty-
eight days before Denny arrives
on STS-76 to relieve him, Paul
learns almost all of the Dulux paint
names, Sophie learns to count and
recite the alphabet, and Joni has an
affair with a guy she meets in the
grocery store.
*
Joni picks up the phone on Satur-
day evening, after I’ve called four
times. She probably picks it up to
tell me to stop calling, but I cut in
before she slams down the receiver.
“Joni, please,” I blurt. “I’ve already
bought her a birthday present.”
Joni’s voice is cold, I can hear her
sister in the background: “Joni, just
hang up the phone.”
“Oh, right, so that’s a good rea-
son to talk to you? That’s going to
make things better, right, Paul?”
she says. “Buying things. That’ll fix
everything.”
“That’s not what I meant.” I ex-
pect the line to go dead but when it
doesn’t, I venture: “I want to come
and see you; I want to say sorry.”
“Sorry for what?” (Denny was
right)
“Uh – for everything.”
She scoffs. “I bet you are.” (“Joni
– hang up.”)
“I am, I am,” I start scrambling
for words and none of them seem
good enough. “I’m sorry for never
caring enough about you when I
“I’m sick of this, Paul,” Joni yells. “All you
ever do is read and run.” She slams the door
when she takes Sophie to the park but she
comes home later, kisses him and says, “I’m
sorry – I know how much this means to you.”
