‘Disney Klan’d’ by Chris Clarke Spray paint & Stencil on photograph; Mickey: Marker Pen & Acrylic on Photograph
This piece employs an unashamed use of the Banksy style of Stencil Graffiti to satirise racism. The figure of Disney’s
Mickey Mouse, who encompasses both black and white, is apparently surrounded by tall and foreboding
members of the Klu Klux Klan , whilst apparently explaining the absurdity of the situation. This serves to highlight the
ludicrous nature of racism as a concept in today’s society, where it is possible for a cartoon character to be scrutinised
over issues of race and a society of ill informed and closed minded people wearing dresses can become a taboo. It
seems that it requires 2D thinking to explain the flaws of racism to such people, so maybe it is time to stop fearing the
use of their image as such mindless hatred deserves no control over what we may think and say.
