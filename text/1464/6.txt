ARTOPSY 6 7
is a sculpture inspired by the Surrealism movement. Here, the bench is split
along the middle with each side have a character of its own. The contrast of
the cold steel, and the old organic wood represents the character duality that
can exist in doctors in response to events unfolding around them. Whether
it’s their reaction to a traumatic event, or to impress colleagues during ward
rounds; an invisible wall is built to hide one’s true feelings. Traumatic events,
such as death of a patient, is represented by the bleeding heart and it’s shielded
by the broken mask in attempt to hide the emotional turmoil. The full mask,
coupled with the stethoscope, symbolizes the textbook professional persona
a doctor would put on in front of patients and colleagues. The bench itself
is a metaphor for the need to rest and reflect on both sides of this duality.
