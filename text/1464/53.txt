Beginner’s Guide to Being an Art Student
Hi, you’re probably not going to understand this sub-head because it’s like so metaphysical and deep, you know?
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
Oh here we go again, ‘WA WA WA I’m Nick
Clegg and I have no sense of humour WA WA
WA’
A
rt - it’s alright. Art
students however,
@£%R*@£FWN*H@*£HFD
N$*&£$£*! !@&*DHJ7
h&QSIFWNBG@$*$Y@*
.... make me want to repeatedly punch the
nearest object. I now owe the felix office a
new keyboard, but for now I’ve stolen the
puzzle editor’s keyboard - he’s the guy
that does the puzzles. Look at him all like,
‘where’s my keyboard? I can’t do my puz-
zles without a keyboard. Puzzle editor
is angry rarrrr.’ Stupid puzzle guy can’t
even solve a fucking puzzle and he refers
to himself in third person as puzzle guy.
Puzzle editor is weird. But enough of puz-
zle guy! I was talking about art students,
f - @£T*£*RJ£RIP£$R£(£$G($£H$£PH,
shit now I owe puzzle editor a keyboard.
Now the first step to becoming an art student is dressing appropriately.
You are beyond fashion. Your clothing is an expression of your person-
ality and is a window into your soul, therefore you should look stupid
and pretentious. As a guy, wear a dangly earring in your right ear, not
because you’re gay, but because you’re alternative. Complement this with
something stupid and dangly around your neck. As a girl try wearing a
dark shade of lipstick that matches your Victorian child’s dress with those
weird shoulders. Remember girls to always look up to the right, as this
makes you look pensive and creative. The right hemisphere of the brain
is your artsy side. You may notice that the female art student in the pic-
ture above is actually looking up to the left, but she’s non-conformist and
doesn’t conform to brain hemispheres.
Remind people that you’re an art student by
telling them you just “get things that they
don’t”. Talk about yourself and how you’re
so complicated and depressed, yet enig-
matic and avant-garde. If the conversation
is veering towards something non-you re-
lated, quickly turn the topic back to your-
self by asking them if they’d like to hear the
poem you’ve written. If all else fails, just sit
there and pull the “Ugh you’re so narrow-
minded” look, depicted above.
Step 2 is talking about yourself; Step 3 concentrates on talking about all
the amazing places you’ve been. Now as an Art Student you hate oth-
ers engaging in your one-sided conversation so avoid this by going to
really obscure locations and finding a small quirky inscrutable club or
bar. You can eliminate the dreaded possibility of another member of the
conversation having been to your chosen venue by making it up. Shake-
spearean sounding names work great, like ‘Othello’s’ or ‘the Iago’ or just
put random words together like ‘tin sprinkle’ or ‘spandex soldiers’. Well,
maybe not Spandex Soldiers, but I had such a great night at Tin Sprinkle
the other night. It’s in Spurt. Oh my God you’ve never been to Spurt? You
know it’s like really far East London, just north of the Tempest Avenue.
It’s like so indie and everyone there is like really on my level you know?
Oh man, you guys just don’t get me.
Art Students don’t do art, they do interpre-
tive art, which is easy. You’ve just got to
know how to talk utter shit about nothing.
So just draw abso-fucking-lutely anything
in the box to the right.
Now look at it and write down the first
two words that come into your head in the
box below. This is your title. Art students
will spend about three months of thought
and portfolio work on the title.
Now fill in the blanks with words and you
have your interpretation.
“This expresses my feelings of deep
________ and symbolises a hidden and un-
foreseen________, which modern society
looks upon with _________’’
