Three cheeky ‘n charming Little Maids
Lucy Harrold joins The Three Little Maids for a chat at the Royal Academy of Music to chat about their
upcoming concert, comedy cabaret and whether scientists are good in bed
How did you meet and where did
the name Three Little Maids come
from?
Alex: I met Kate at Kings College
where we both studied music, I went
up to her on the first day and said “I
think you’re really pretty” in her specs
and floral shirt, Kate replied “Ok…my
name’s Kate” and we went from there.
Jen: I met Kate and Alex through
Kings’ Musical Theatre Society, which
they were ruling over at the time and
I would then be passed the crown for.
They were living in a house on Old
Kent Road with my new boyfriend and
ended up liking me more!
Kate: And then we did a cabaret show
called “And Then There Were Six”
with three other boys, we dropped the
boys to make Three Little Maids.
Alex: Then I discovered our very
handsome pianist Leo when he was
reptiteur for IC MTSoc’s spring show
‘How To Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying’ which I appeared in.
Kate: We’re called the Three Little
Maids because there’s three of us, and
we’re girls
Alex: The Three Little Maids song is
from the Hot Mikado, a jazzed up ver-
sion of the G&S classic.
How would you describe your style
and who do you think you appeal to
most?
All: Cheeky charming close harmony
cabaret!
Jen: We’re like the Poo-poo (Puppini)
Sisters and the Andrew Sisters but
better.
Alex: There’s lots of three part girl
groups but they’ve all jumped on the
retro bandwagon and niched them-
selves. They just do one style or a nov-
elty thing like jazzing up pop songs.
We do a bit of everything.
Jen: We do just what we want to do, we
try not to do things others could do, we
put a bit of ourselves in it.
Kate: It’s a cross between cabaret and
comedy! Our rule is for every serious
song, we’ll do three funny songs. And
we do always pay homage to our true
love, musical theatre. But the 60s pop
songs have been going down well in
our Old Vic Pit Bar gigs.
Alex: The thing I’m proud of is not
taking ourselves seriously, we’re a little
bit silly and have remained true to our
individual personalities and our loves,
I’ll wank over some Sondheim, Kate
will pay homage to Judy Garland…
Most of you have links with Impe-
rial through MTSoc and MTSoc
tour, so can scientists make good
performers/lovers?
Jen: My boyfriend is a scientist and he
loves musical theatre. Scientists are
good because there’s a connection be-
tween Maths and Music.
Alex: Well, mines a wannabe scientist,
he’s a bit of a geek and reads the New
Scientist.
Kate: My dad is a scientist and he loves
the Maids, secretly he wants to be one
of us. I’ve heard he’s an excellent lover.
Jen: Scientists work very hard so they
need some relief
Alex: They have to think creatively , be
brave and take risks just as actors do.
All: Our conclusion is…yes!
What do you enjoy most about per-
forming together and what’s your fa-
vourite venue and dream venue?
Kate: The Old Vic Pit Bar!
Alex: Royal Festival Hall would be
my dream as I have fond memories of
playing in orchestras when I was little.
The Albert Hall would be amazing too
but we also work well in small intimate
venues so I think the Menier Chocolate
Factory would be great. We did some
gigs in Jen’s hometown of Norwich at
the Sewell Barn which was lovely and
intimate.
Jen: I like working with these two be-
cause they make me laugh. My pleasure
is to work with such talented people
as these guys. They have these amaz-
ing arrangements and I’d never get the
opportunity to work with people like
them anywhere else.
Kate: I enjoy our banter, we’re never
quite sure what we’re doing next. Alex
generally plays Mum and I’ll talk until
someone tells me to stop.
Alex: I feel we have a real partnership
so that we can trust our instincts to
know what to do on stage. We can be
ourselves with people we trust.
If the Three Little Maids could be
joined by 3 Little Men, who would
your dream men be?
All: Oooh!
Jen: Philip Quast! And Hugh Jackman
(Alex intercepts with a cry of “No not
Hugh Jackman!”) And Zubin Varla! He
was in Jesus Christ Superstar and he’s
in Warhorse at the moment.
Kate: Can he be dead? Gene Kelly, and
he’d choreograph all our numbers.
Alex: I would have the Australian
god Philip Quast too. Or, I think we’d
push all of those in the sea if Stephen
Sondheim joined us on the piano. Leo
can join in and clap along, or turn the
pages.
What’s your favourite song to sing?
Kate: I know what I like- Chattanooga
Choo Choo.
Jen: Send in the Clowns as that was
the first thing we arranged. Also, Wash
that Man as I’m a real Rodgers and
Hammerstein geek. Plus Leo does an
awesome version of Sesame Street so
that’d be his favourite.
Alex: I like Drive My Car too, we do a
great version ala Lily Allen which the
audiences love. Three Little Maids ob-
viously, our title song. Everyone loves
it when we do it as an encore as we can
just mess around and it goes down re-
ally well. The other two don’t agree but
I like closing with Better from A Class
Act (Lucy at this point cries I love that
song!).
Kate: I’m totes over it. It went down
like a sack of poo last time. I know my
favourite! Man in the Mirror! How did
we forget that? It’s the best thing you’ll
ever see ever! Jen gets all black on us.
Alex: Kate rives around on the floor.
Jen: Alex bursts out from a curtain.
What’s in store for the Three Little
Maids and yourselves individually?
Kate: Worldwide fame, millions in the
bank, lots of lovers.
Jen: This summer is packed with pri-
vate gigs. I really enjoy doing private
gigs because the good thing about
“I’ll wank over
some Sondheim,
Kate will pay
homage to Judy
Garland…”
them is that as we arrange our own
songs, if someone has a favourite
song, we’re happy to accommodate.
Plus from each gig we get another gig,
which is a bonus!
Alex: We’re hoping to have some sort
of Industry launch in London, invite
anyone who’s interested to see us or
manage us or hire us!
“No, not Hugh
Jackman!”
Kate I’m doing a musical at the
Young Vic, The Human Comedy in
September.
Alex: I’m singing in the Stephen Sond-
heim performer of the year final, hope-
fully that’ll go nicely. Plus I’m playing
Desiree in A Little Night Music at
RAM.
Jen: I’m starting RAM in the Autumn
but at the moment I’m a primary
school teacher.
Leo: I’m musical directing Hamlet the
Musical at the Edinburgh Fringe.
We were hoping it would star Tim
Minchin but sadly he’s turned down
the role.
Alex: I want to play Ophelia! If Leo can
wangle it. And if it pays.
Alex Young: “Maid in Taiwan” Kate Marlais: “Maid in Heaven” Jennifer Woodward: “Bar Maid”
