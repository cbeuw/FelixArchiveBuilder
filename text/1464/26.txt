I remember strolling into the Oxfam Shop on
Gloucester Road, timidly asking for the manager.
“Can we borrow some clothes for a photoshoot
please?” From then on, there was no going back.
We put together a shoot in less than a week. We
had Toni&Guy do the models’ hair. We waved some
inspiration photos in the air and pointed ‘This, we
want this hair on her’.
We spotted a wedding dress. The shooting location
was the basement of the Oxfam Shop. There were
three floor to ceiling cages for sorting out the
moutainous donations they received every day.
This kind of collaboration is always fun. And it never
ceases to amaze me the talents we have at Imperial.
We have photographers who excel at capturing
emotions and producing photographs of fantastic
compositions. We have students who can do make
up and hair like professionals. Not to mention the
models, who are very photogenic and patient; who
also have the stamina to toil through the long hours
of posing and hence the stiff muscles!
But FashionSoc does more than that. We run sewing
lessons. From sketching the dress to actually making
one - the process is a lot of fun. Getting to wear a
dress that has a tag that reads ‘Made by’ and not
‘Made in’, is the most satisfying feeling in the world.
It makes us feel we are ‘unique’ because we wear
‘bespoke, one off pieces’.
We planned to do a fashion show this year to
showcase our society’s work. Unfortunately it didn’t
materialise due to the small number of garments we
had. Next year though, we hope to see your work on
the catwalk! - KW
