Date Night
Date Night fails to impress
We are first introduced to the Fos-
ters. Claire (Fey) is a realtor and Phil
(Carell) is a tax advisor. They are mar-
ried with kids and once a week, they
have a date night, an evening spent
outside their house, away from their
children; just the two of them having
a not-so-special meal in a local steak-
house. But their lives have become so
repetitive and bland that there is no
spark anymore. They are both so tired
all the time and there seems to be no
such thing as passion in their marriage.
Eventually they want a break and
something entirely new. So on yet an-
other date night, they go to a big, fancy,
glamorous restaurant in the city, with-
out a reservation. Do they manage to
get a table? Not a chance. But by saying
they are the Tripplehorns, they are able
to steal someone else’s reservation. So
far so good: they’re having nice food,
spending a great time, and things are
really starting to look up. But this is
until a couple of mobsters (Common,
Jimmi Simpson) pay a visit to their ta-
ble. It turns out that the Tripplehorns
are in some serious trouble for anger-
ing a gangster boss. The bad guys now
think the Fosters are the Tripplehorns
for obvious reasons and of course, they
will stop at nothing to kill them. So
the Fosters need to think and act fast:
run away from the two assassins, find
the real Tripplehorns and clear their
names.
The familiar concept of mistaken
identity works well to begin with, with
Fey and Carell making an incredibly
likable but more importantly, a con-
vincing couple. There is nothing ex-
traordinary about these two people,
both in terms of their looks and oc-
cupation, so it’s not too difficult to in-
stantly relate to them. They’re helpless
and hopeless while being chased down
by these two professional killers and
this is where their remarkable chem-
istry pays off. The chase itself is far
from impressive, just some textbook
stuff that’s hardly anything special but
it’s the dialogue that comes out of our
leads’ mouths that at least keeps the
film going with a sustainable, comic
tone. The outrageously preposterous
things the two not-so-special civilians
end up doing do have their moments
of solid comedy for which the two out-
standing leads deserve a lot of credit.
Would this have been possible without
Fey or Carell? Very unlikely.
But the trouble is, as the film
progresses, it presents an incred-
ibly unbalanced, unfocused mix of
action and comedy that never quite
reaches the high standards to satisfy
the two very different genres. We are
introduced to more characters: Mark
Wahlberg is Holbrooke, a security
contractor who refuses to put
on a shirt. James Franco and
Mila Kunis are the real Trip-
plehorns and Ray Liotta is
the angry villain. What these
supporting characters lack is
any sense of purpose and
memorable quality.
Yes, Wahlberg works
out and his shirtless
appearance is very
different to what
Carell’s must be
like (ha ha), but this
cannot last long.
Franco and Ku-
nis are a couple of
dim, low-life, love-struck
idiots who get into awk-
ward, childish argu-
ments. The supporting
characters do not carry
much humour, which is
a shame given the un-
limited talents of Fey and
Carell.
The action isn’t much bet-
ter either. There are some
gunshots fired and there is the
inevitable car-chase that the
trailer spent so long on adver-
tising. But the chase turns out
Oh my Science!

to be something that goes on endlessly
in a completely adrenaline-free man-
ner. The cars look slick, they are capa-
ble of travelling at very high speeds and
there is explosive music to go with that
sequence but when this uninteresting,
one-note action carries on mindlessly,
that’s exactly when the film starts to
lose the plot and fails to engage the
audience thoroughly. Exactly what did
the Tripplehorns do to upset Liotta so
much? After a while, this seems lost on
us, completely irrelevant, and it’s not
as if the conclusion is at all satisfying.
What started off so well soon turns
into a mediocre action/comedy romp
wannabe. This should have been a lot
more character-driven given the tal-
ents involved, but director Shawn Levy
makes the fatal mistake of loading this
with action scenes that are far from
spectacular. Shockingly unmemorable,
the leading pair deserves so much bet-
ter – any future collaboration between
the two will be more than welcome,
just not with the same direc-
tor and writers.
O
h God, it’s so ridicu-
lously easy to rip into
the scientific accuracy
of films that I usually
turn a blind eye and
hope my intellect hasn’t been perma-
nently damaged by the typical on-
slaught of pseudo-technical jargon that
would make Faraday incinerate his life-
time work and declare humanity isn’t
worth the benefits of electricity.
It’s usually the physicists among us
who get to raise their eyes to the heavens
and groan at the blatant impracticabili-
ties of burrowing to the Earth’s core to
nuke it back into full function and some-
how prevent more lightning storms
from destroying global landmarks. It
baffles me how movie posters proudly
display ‘from the director of The Day Af-
ter Tomorrow’ as an indication of quality.
“Neutinos! Mutant! Earthquakes! Noah’s
Ark!” barks a semi-stoned Roland Em-
merich at his special effect gurus and
Hey Presto! Six months down the line
and we have 2012 and a fat pay cheque
in the pocket of the said lazy German
b***ard.
Fortunately, my subject, chemistry, is
usually too dull to receive the special at-
tention from Hollywood. “Oh My God”
is not the obvious reaction to “the chro-
mium ion is increasing its oxidation
state, it’s going to precipitate into a new
complex!” Whereas imagine Jon Voight’s
sincerely shocked expression when he
hears “the quantum intensity of the
Higgs bosons are reaching critical point,
five hundred more joules of dark mat-
ter and the galaxy will be crushed inside
of a black hole!” Oh Jon, remember the
70s when you used to make good films?
After pulling me out of the shower, my
therapist forced me to watch Midnight
Cowboy seven times to heal the mental
anguish caused by Transformers.
What has triggered this tirade of com-
plaining, you might be wondering. Well,
I settled down to watch Iron Man 2 the
other day; it was as I predicted, terri-
ble but the abuse Jon Favreau decided
to give chemistry took me by surprise.
If you haven’t seen Iron Man 2 and are
dwelling in patient anticipation of its
(not so) thrilling plot then I don’t ad-
vise reading on, or in Internet speak -
**Spoiler Alert**
Our hero Tony Stark has developed
a nasty rash due to poisoning from the
mini nuclear fusion reactor sticking out
of his chest. It’s alright though, as Sam
Jackson gives him a healthy dose of
lithium dioxide to treat it. Wait a minute
Sam, you could have used any of the
thousands of real chemicals to cure this
mythical condition but no, you’ve man-
aged to force the lithium atom to accept
three more electrons pairs than is physi-
cally possible. I know I’m being pedan-
tic, but any half-bothered teenager with
two C’s in GCSE science could tell you
that lithium dioxide is a made up chemi-
cal. How hard is it to say di-lithium ox-
ide instead?
It gets much worse though. Apparent-
ly, LiO2
isn’t a very effective cure for the
metallic blue spider rash and so Tony
decides to make a new element him-
self. Using a giant spanner and a laser
he manages to overcome the problem
of overcrowding in the Periodic Table
and make a nice shiny metal. Last time
I checked, someone hadn’t forgotten
to discover the element between pal-
ladium and silver because there can’t
possibly be one! I suppose children will
now be squeezing toothpaste into the
bathroom sink: “Trying to make a new
element Mummy - just like Iron Man.”
These crimes against science com-
bined with Sarah Jessica Parker’s face
prominently displayed on billboards are
making me feel so depressed, I’m rather
tempted to try drugs. If you need me,
I’ve gone to see Robert Downey Jr about
a briefcase.

Summer
Highlights
Scott Pilgrim vs. The
World
Hey, did you see the film where
Michael Cera played a socially awkward
teenager? In Scott Pilgrim he breaks
that typecast, well a little bit. Based
on the cult comic book series of the
same film, the titular hero of the film
falls in love with the girl of his dreams.
Unfortunately, she has quite a history
and Cera has to shed off his geeky
persona and battle his new girlfriend’s
seven exes (not all of them male). The
film is heavily inspired by computer
games and has a very unique graphic
style. It looks like heaps of fun from
the trailer and Michael Cera’s natural
charisma should complement the fast-
paced action perfectly. He gets to wield a
flaming sword - awesome!
Toy Story 3
Jonah Hex
Megan Fox in a corset. Josh Brolin plays a
disfigured gunslinger with supernatural
powers who seeks revenge against the
man who murdered his family. There’s
bucketfuls of action involving dynamite-
firing crossbows. Did I mention Megan
Fox in a corset?
The franchise that made Pixar a
household name returns with its third
installment. Andy’s all grown up now
and is going to college so he donates his
beloved toys to a nursery. Not delighted
by a lifetime of abuse by toddlers,
Woody, Buzz and gang hatch an escape
to rival that of Steve McQueen.
