Arrow Maze was broken last week
as many of you noticed. A few of you
wrote in to notify me. I am fairly cer-
tain only one square was in error, un-
fortunately no solution submitted was
abletoshowthisandmysolutionsheet
has been misplaced within the office. I
apologise profusely. - Puzzle Captain.
There were several entries for our
new Relic puzzle which last week
featured the maze to the right.
The first correct submission was
by Sheryl and has been included
as photographed to the right.
We apologise if in print it seems
just a bit too small to view!
Again I’ve got a bit too much
space to fill... So here’s a joke:
Why do undertakers wear ties?
Because their profession is very
serious, and it is important that their
appearance has a degree of gravitas.
O
nce again I’m being forced
to write the introduc-
tion to Coffee Break in
the absense of Murdoch.
Literally, chained-to-the-desk forced.
Fortunately nobody bothers checking
what I actually write so I just got to fill
up the space with random musings.
Out of interest has anyone out there
seen my keyboard? Of course, I am
typing on a keyboard now, but this is
not MY keyboard. My keyboard is an
offshade of white, with a QWERTY
layout and very distinctive but diffi-
cult to describe balls of dust beneath
the keys, and the spacebar’s too lose
and the return key jams occassionally.
If you find a keyboard matching this
description please bring it down to the
felix office so I can confirm whether or
not it’s mine.
It’s quite important to me. I bought
it into the office from home. It was
bought for me by my grandfather. He’s
no longer with us... He danced his last
dance... He kicked the bucket... It was
a very emotional experience for my
mother. She loved that bucket and
hated his dancing and was looking for
any excuse to justifiably ask him to
move out. To add injury to insults, he
tripped over the bucket when leaving
and twisted his ankle. He can walk fine
but he sure misses being able to dance.
Wordpath 1,464
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Slitherlink 1,464
Here is Slitherlink, back from the
dead! (Or rising from the ashes of
Nonolink if you will.)
For all those that were upset to see
it masked beneath (a not always
solvable) Nonogram puzzle. I hope I
have satisfied your cries for it’s return
in this (what I hope will prove to be)
slightly more challenging form!
For those who are wondering what
happened to the Nonogram puzzle,
it too is somewhere amid the ashes
of the Nonolink but has developed a
case of pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis and needs some
time to recover.
The last time we saw it however it was
displaying the pathetic attempt at a
puzzle of:
Which it tried to assure us represents
a ‘phoenix’ in Conway’s Game of Life.
