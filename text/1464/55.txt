Halloumi-scopes: Horoscopes do it Greek-style
So their economy is in the toilet – who cares? They’ve still got plenty of cheese! Salty, squeaky, rubbery cheese.
Cancer
Imperial has made
you so desperate
that you’re cruising
for MILFs near the
local school. A man
comes up to you and
compliments you on
your boyish looks. He offers to take you home.
Assuming that he’s a swinger with similar intent,
you agree. The night is a blur but you wake up in
knee-highs with lemon bon-bons inserted where
they shouldn’t be. Zesty!
Virgo
With excitement and
frustration, You sign
up to an online dating
site. Finally you get
your first e-mail asking
to meet. You turn up in
the JCR with a bottle
of baby oil. You’re disappointed when your tutor
shows up. Oh, just another meeting. He starts
rubbing your leg. Or not. Months later, you
graduate with a 2:2. “Poor student, worse lover.”
Gemini
You’ve gone to Rich-
mond to see a film and
you’re understandably
nervous. You’ve heard
awful stories about
south of the river. But
the streets are clean, the shops are pretty and the
people are nice. Oh, how you were wrong! After
a most pleasant stay, you return to the Union for
one last pint. Smelling the South London on you,
a pack of rabid MechEng tears you to pieces.
Pisces
It’s BBQ time and a
friend asks for help
carrying a melon.
Sure, how hard can it
be? You break an arm
trying to lift it; it’s
denser than a black
hole. Apparently, Cern have branched out into
groceries now. Aware of the danger you are all
in, you lift the melon up over your head and run
heroically down the street. You slip, the melon
falls, the world implodes. Bravo!
Leo
You’ve heard that
Cleopatra bathed in
milk to preserve her
beauty. In order to stay
awake and revise, you
run yourself a bath of
instant coffee and jump
in. Maybe you should have let it cool down first. To
soothe your scalded skin, you take a shower, having
first crushed a gross of ProPlus into the boiler. It
works though! You stay awake all night, right up
until your heart explodes.
Aries
You’re in the middle of
a banging sweet orgy.
Oh yeah! Well, actu-
ally, it’s a three-some...
except it’s more like
just you. But there’s
still loads of people
watching, that’s got to count for something. You’re
in the lecture theatre, masturbating into a sock.
You were giving a presentation and, to relieve the
pressure, imagined everyone naked. What else
could you do after that?
Scorpio
Books stretch out in-
finitely before you.
There’s so much to learn
and so little time! You
jerk awake; it was only a
dream. Your big-breast-
ed girlfriend strokes
your chest and suggests a blowjob might make
you feel better. You smile as she descends. You jerk
awake. Damn, that was just a dream! You’re in the
library, books really are spread all around you...and
you’ve just come all over them.
Libra
To reverse Imperial’s
drain on your coolness
you’ve started wearing
sunglasses everywhere.
Even indoors. Shame
you look like a blind
person. Even dogs
think so. A confused guide-dog finds you and
leads you to cross the road. But you don’t want
to cross the road! Angry, the dog bites your
hand. You run away from it...and straight into an
oncoming lorry. You gives the lorry rabies.
Taurus
You’re walking into
college when a pigeon
decides to take a crap
on you. Ugh, and on
your new coat as well!
That cost 1.7 student
loans! Enraged, you
throw a stone at the flying rat. You miss but the
bird is terrified. It voids its bowels all over you.
Horrified, you look up just in time for the pigeon
to land on your face. Turns out you did hit it - and
kill it! Pigeon-murderer...
Capricorn
It’s a glorious day and
you’re soaking up the
rays outside the Union.
It’s perfect weather for
a G&T. Except instead
of gin, you have vodka
and instead of tonic,
you have more vodka. It’s a bit warm so you drop in
some vodka ice-cubes. You pass out and when you
wake up, the Rugby team have tied you to a tree.
Someone is talking but you can’t make it out what
they’re saying. Is it, “Pint?”
Aquarius
It’s 1am on a Friday
night and you’re in the
mood for a kebab. You
order the usual and
when it comes, there’s
this big chunk of
eraser on top. You ask
why there’s a pencil-case on your food. The guy
says it’s a gourmet kebab, designed by Heston
Blumenthal. You take a bite – it tastes like HB
pencils. That’ll be £11.99, please thank-you, sir!

Sagittarius
Instead of revising, you
spent your time teaching
squirrels to bring you
crib sheets, bribing them
with peanut brittle. On
the day of the exam,
you summon your furry
followers and ace the exam. As you leave, the
squirrels are outside, waiting. They want their pay.
You finished the brittle last night with a weird-ass
kebab. They rip out your throat and bury it. Yes,
they eat more than just brittle now.
