A TEMPEST
AMONGST
US
W
e all know the stereotype of an Imperial student. Look around you. If you can’t
see at least one person that fits like a glove, you’re it. Unless you’re sitting next to
Tempest van Schaik, that is. She’s a first year PhD student in the Bioengineering
department by day, and a prolific artist by night. Born in Johannesburg in 1985, she’s been living
in London for about a year now. Her work has been exhibited across South Africa whilst she
completed a stonking two degrees at The University Of The Witwatersrand in Biomedical and
Electrical Engineering. During that time, she set up two creative brands, Suzy Pedigree and
Ellommenopee. As she moves onto pastures new (and climates colder), a name has already been
madeforherselfhereatImperial.HerpieceshavebeenfeaturedintheImperialCollegeSt.Mary’s
Art Exhibition and Imperial’s Women in Science, Engineering and Technology photography
gallery this year. A scientist, an engineer, a businesswoman and an artist. Our hats are off to her.
YOU’VE BEEN IN LONDON FOR 6
MONTHS, HOW’S IT BEEN TREATING
YOU?
After graduating in South Africa I rushed over
to start in Imperial’s Spring term. On my first
day at Imperial I was still living in a hostel, so it
was pretty tough settling in. What I love about
London is how it’s impossible to be bored. There
are always amazing art exhibitions and concerts
showing somewhere, and because of the density
of universities I’ve been regularly going to aca-
demic talks by top thinkers in every field from
evolutionary biology to religion, psychology and
climate change.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE LAMENTED ON
IMPERIAL’S NATURAL LACK OF CREA-
TIVITY BEING A SCIENCE-ONLY INSTI-
TUTION. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO
COME TO IMPERIAL FOR YOUR PHD?
I chose Imperial purely from an engineering
point of view: for the quality of research in my
department, the facilities and the engineering
education I would get. I expected to have to pur-
sue creative endeavours on my own, outside of
university.

WHAT INTERESTS YOU ABOUT YOUR
PHD AT IMPERIAL?
It draws on a broad range of multidisciplinary
skills from my undergraduate engineering de-
grees, but also requires learning new topics such
as chemistry. Because it’s empirical research I’m
not confined to my desk, but use the electronics,
chemistry and tissue culture labs where I enjoy
working with my hands, whether it’s to find ways
to sew with microscopic wire or to suffocate a
colony of cells. I also value getting a broad educa-
tion and enjoy the regular supply of bioengineer-
ing academics presenting their research.
HOW ARE YOU USING YOUR LIFE AT IMPE-
RIAL TO INSPIRE YOUR ART?
Imperial is a few minutes away from some of
the most beautiful museums in the world. This
means that if I need inspiration I can marvel at
grotesque deep-sea fish, romantic steam engines
and opulent royal tapestries.
HAS STRIKING A BALANCE OF PRIORI-
TIES BETWEEN YOUR ENGINEERING DE-
GREE AND CREATIVE AMBITION BEEN
CHALLENGING?
Yes, it’s always been difficult and I have to make
