PHOENIX
A
s the night creeps through the dark veins of the city streets,
silence overheard only by the whimpering wind,
the world stands ready awaiting the new day.
The citizens sleeping soundly in their beds as the world turns instead,
seeking for a long lost sibling gone ahead.
The cold air breathing down the backs of the midnight slackers,
who break barriers between reality and dream,
just by their presence in this livid scene.
Lovely sounds of the solitary hounds cowling for the lack of life,
hunting heroes for a cackle or strife.
And the lone fox, tiptoeing through the streets,
laughing at the high-heeled feet,
craving the slightest piece of meat.
Eat, eat, all he wants is to eat.
Look into his eyes and to your surprise you will see nothing but a piece of yourself,
discretely distorted by your trickling health.
Feeling the hushing hum of the vibrating vendors he flees to a more discrete venue,
surely to find some plump spectator willing to part with a shackle or two.
And there he runs,
off again,
before you could even count to ten.
It’s like a game with him,
for by a single whim and a gong from the clocks.
Gone.
Good night little fox.
Victor du Mesnil du Buisson
Whomping bass lines and cowbell treble,
It’s the sound of our youth: teenage rebels.
It’s about finding yourself amongst the crowd,
Find a soap-box and announce it loud:
‘We’re the bright young things!’
We split ears and let it ring
Across the park, from our corner,
‘This is us!’ hears the yesteryear mourner.
