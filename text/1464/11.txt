John Glenn saw it, like a marble on
the tarmac.
*
Between 1980 and 1984, Wayne
County High School’s library reg-
isters one hundred and twenty
counts of checking out just one
particular video tape. All but three
of those stamps in the inside of
“1969 – The Eagle Has Landed” are
for Paul Garton, who watches and
re-watches that tape so much in
the A.V. room he can tell you every
flicker of light on the greyscale ho-
rizon and every scuff of static on
the audio track.
Paul holds the rewind button
and his finger is sure, steady, as
the machine pulls it all back. Neil
and Buzz jump up and down, they
take down the American flag, they
leap backwards into the rocket and
take off. On the winter solstice, he
rides his bike up Hoosier Hill with
a thermos of hot blackcurrant to
watch the longest night of the year
unfold in all of its soaring, speck-
led glory. He can hear the crackle
of that 1969 news report in his ears
as he pounds his feet on the ped-
als; he can feel the warm sizzle of
that old tape reel glowing in his
teeth and bones when he powers
through the cold.
“I don’t get it, Paul,” says his old-
er brother, Frank. “I think you’re
nuts.” Frank’s girlfriend smiles
over the dinner table, fork full of
spaghetti.
“Oh, I think it’s romantic!” she
says.
Paul watches that tape over and
over, and he reads, and he runs,
and he rides his bike to watch the
solstice shake off the sun in a twen-
ty-nine degree night. How roman-
tic the whole thing is, Paul doesn’t
really know. His first girlfriend is
sixteen and sleeping in her home in
Ohio when he’s cycling up Hoosier
Hill in 1982. He doesn’t know it;
the first time he meets her is 1986,
when he’s sat on the floor outside
his dorm room door and she’s in
bed with his college roommate.

Here’s a strange dream I’ve been
having since I was eleven years old.
In this dream, I’m twenty-some-
thing, as athletic and as tall as I’ve
always wanted to be. I see myself in
the reflection from the reinforced
glass of my helmet, looking out
onto that vast blackness I’d only
ever seen before in double-page
spreads of The Encyclopaedia of
Space. Silence.
“Hello?”
“You had us worried for a minute
there, Eagle.” CAPCOM’s crackled
response.
“Commencing untethered space
walk, Houston.” I say, seeing the
earth down there – that hazy blue-
green marble.
“Your wife and kids are here,
Eagle.”
I’m reaching for the airlock door.
“My wife?”
“And your kids.”
When I’m turning the door han-
dle, I realise, in that numb and
off-handed way in which thoughts
occur in dreams, that CAPCOM is
actually my dad’s voice. I idly won-
der when he got this new job, won-
der if he’s still going to be working
at the second-hand car dealership.
“Listen, Eagle. We have a mes-
sage for you.”
“I’m listening, Dad.”
I step outside, putting my feet
out to no resistance. Like John
Glenn said, it’s a thing that cannot
be described. It’s like floating, but
it’s not. It’s like falling, but it’s not.
Over the radio, there’s some static.
“Listen to this, Eagle.”
And, whilst I’m there – suspend-
ed out alone, hovering uncertainly
like those preserved things in the
jars at the Museum of Natural His-
tory – my Dad starts to play me
Creedence Clearwater Revival’s
“Fortunate Son”. I don’t really ques-
tion it; I listen to it, like he told me
to. I’m thinking about the times he
played it to me and Frank in the
car on the way to visit our grand-
parents and can almost see us
both down there – tiny, clockwork
movements – driving up the I-69
with Frank giving me a dead arm in
the back. Lights – street lights, car
lights, whole cities start to switch
on and off, and the small earth
twinkles gently. When Perth is on,
Paris fades out. When Oslo lights
up, New York darkens. The process
is smooth, flowing and undulating
with an eerie, mesmerising beauty.
I take off my helmet to get a bet-
ter look. I breathe in; I feel okay.
I’ve never told anyone about
this dream, can’t really see why I
would. Not even when I was in the
hospital did I think to mention this
dream but I had it every month or
so, almost exactly like this. Some-
times CAPCOM played me some
CSNY.

Paul’s college roommate is Jer-
ry Secker, a loud, broad-shoul-
dered American History major. If
prompted to describe him, Paul
will say that Jerry is one of those
guys who, when asked casually if
they’re feeling hungry at all, will re-
ply, “I’m always hungry.” If prompt-
ed to describe Paul, Jerry will shrug
his Atlas-worthy shoulders and
say, “He’s an alright guy, you know?
Quiet. All he does is read and run.”
On February 20th, 1986, Jerry’s
having sex with the girl Paul’s go-
ing to marry but, since Paul hasn’t
met her yet, he sits out in the cor-
ridor with one ear pressed to his
portable radio, listening to the
news report on Mir.
“Sorry,” Jerry mutters when he
opens the door. Paul doesn’t mind
and says so.
“What are you listening to?” the
girl asks, appearing in the doorway,
hurriedly dressed and sheepish.
“They just launched Mir,” says
Paul.
Jerry frowns. “Who did?”
“The Soviets.”
“Holy shit, that’s bad, right?”
The girl giggles and lands an
endearing punch on Jerry’s bicep.
“No, silly, it’s that space thing, isn’t
it?”
“It’s a space station,” Paul nods
and smiles a little at this girl Jerry’s
got his arm around. “They’re not
bombing us or anything.”
On this exact day, twenty-four
years ago, John Glenn became the
first man to orbit the earth in four
hours, fifty-five minutes and twen-
ty-three seconds.
“I think it’s kind of cool,” says the
girl. “What’s your name, by the
way?”
“It’s Paul,” Paul says.
“I’m Joni,” she says and steps out,
barefoot, into the corridor to shake
his hand. When she leans in, the
neckline of her sundress falls open
and Paul glimpses, beneath the
cotton, the pale-skinned contours
leading down to her breasts. Joni
continues to sleep with Jerry for a
week and a half, and after that she
dates a boy called Howard for a
while, but she marries Paul in 1991.

I attribute almost everything that
happens to me, the good and the
bad, to meeting John Glenn that
one time when I was an impres-
sionable seven-year old. If I ever
met him again, I think I’d ask him
to come with me when I apologise
to Joni. I would explain to him that
he should probably have never
come down to Wayne County,
never picked my skinny arm out of
the crowd, never had a beer with
Henry Duke in the Indiana spring.
Sometimes, now, I think that if
I had met Henry Duke instead of
John Glenn, things would have
been a lot different. But Henry
Duke isn’t allowed to hold talks,
or visit schools and town halls,
at least, not if NASA’s PR depart-
ment hears about it. And they hear
about it. He wrote three articles
on his space-travel experiences
that were all blocked before they
could even feel the cold breath of
Time magazine’s overaggressive
office air-conditioning. They were
blocked before he’d even licked
the stamps to send them. The best
Henry Duke ever did, in the twen-
ty-eight earthbound years before
his death, was to write bitter letters
to the Your Say pages of minor as-
tronomy magazines under pseudo-
nyms. Even then, he was painfully
aware that his efforts were futile
responses to similarly dispirited
people who never found a thing
that made their lives feel full. He
got little comfort from it.
I never met Henry Duke, or his
angry wife, or his angry son. I only
heard about him, five years after his
death, from the man who shared
the hospital room with me. I think
sometimes that I’d like to have met
him; we’d have a lot to talk about.

Joni turns up at the restaurant
Paul works at one day in October.
She orders coffee and a slice of
cheesecake, and tells Paul that she’s
stopped seeing Howard, didn’t
know why she’d even started going
out with him in the first place. The
first time they sleep together, Joni’s
elbow knocks his Mir shuttle rep-
lica off the dresser and it lands as
seven splintered bits of acrylic on
the floor.
“Shit, Paul,” she says and stops
pulling off his shirt. “I’m sorry. I’ll
get you another one.”
“Don’t worry,” he says. “I don’t
need the replica; I’ll see it when I
get there.”
One of the things that Joni loves
so much about him, the thing she
usually says first when asked, is the
way he is so sure of himself. Joni
doesn’t know if she wants to watch
a movie or go bowling; Joni still
isn’t sure she picked the right meal
last night at dinner. But you can
ask Paul, and he’ll say “bowling”,
and he’ll say “lasagne”, and Joni’s
always admired that. She doesn’t
know if she wants to go into drama
or teaching, but Paul says he’s go-
ing to go into space and he does.
He doesn’t always talk about
space, though. Paul and Joni also
talk about music that they like,
childhood pets and favourite TV
shows. Paul knows that, of the
things Joni does and does not want,
that she wants to sing at least once
on Broadway and that she never
wants to have to ask her parents
for money. Joni knows that, of the
things Paul will and will not talk
about, he will not talk about his
father’s experiences in Vietnam.
They don’t always talk about space,
and music, and parents. Twice,
they talk about children’s names
– Emily, Jason, Sophie. Once, Paul
asks her to marry him and she says
yes.
*
We went to couples counselling,
on Joni’s persuasion, once after I
came back. My guess was that this
all happened whilst I was away,
that maybe people we knew started
doing things like this – going to sit
together on leather sofas in the city
to tell a stranger that you’re so sick
of each other. I agreed to go, just so
she would stop asking.
“I don’t know how much I want
to be sitting in the room when you
tell some man we’ve never met all
the things about me that you hate,”
I said, but we were already in the
car on the way there.
“You don’t know how much you
want anything,” Joni muttered to
the window. I turned up the car ra-
dio but did not recognise the mu-
sic. It turned out that the therapist
was a woman, anyway.
I tried to listen as Joni told this
woman about all the things wrong
