31 PHOENIX
‘Girl on Crimson Sheets’, by Chris Clarke
A good, hard
fuck – yes
if she yields.
Turning to cavities
and caresses,
as the anointed
undresses.
Here.
But too much,
surely.
To wait for
on this night,
with a DO NOT DISTURB
sign
on the handle of the door.
There will be no
leftovers
for the dog.
Here. Put your leg here.
David Carr
ON THIS NIGHT
