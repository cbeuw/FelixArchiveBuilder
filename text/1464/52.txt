Android goes Froyo-tastic
Feroz Salam shows you why Froyo is Android’s coming of age
W
hen Google announced
the Android mobile op-
erating system in late
2007, the reaction it re-
ceived was at best, lukewarm. Coming
only a few months after the release of
the iPhone OS, which had taken con-
sumer markets by storm, most analysts
were cautious about the announce-
ment despite the fact that the OS had
the backing of Google. The first release
of the open source OS did nothing to
enthuse them with only a relatively
small number of manufacturers taking
the OS on board and producing rather
clunky handsets; Android proved to
be unattractive and sluggish. Along
with a relatively small developer mar-
ket, there seemed no way that Android
handsets could legitimately compete
with the gloss of the iPhone or the
sleek business chic of the Blackberry.
Yet only two years down the line,
there’s been something of a revolution
in the mobile market. As the look and
feel of the iPhone OS has remained rel-
atively stagnant, Android has reinvent-
ed itself in a new stylish format iterat-
ing rapidly with each release building
solidly on its predecessor. The develop-
ing OS was backed by a lineup of neatly
designed, powerful smartphones from
major mobile manufacturers, which al-
lowed Android powered handsets to
overtake the iPhone to become second
to the Blackberry in terms of sales fig-
ures in the US. With the release of the
next major update of the OS Android
2.2 (codenamed Froyo) earlier this
week, Google seems to be looking to
consolidate this position, now market-
ing the system as a mature OS that can
compete with the best.
Quantitatively, Froyo is stunning. It’s
not often that the jump from version
2.1 to 2.2 offers a 450% speed increase
(yes, that’s 4.5 times faster), but Google
has managed to pull it out of the box
with some impressive optimizations.
Neat improvements in the way code
is run means that Android apps are
nowhere near the sluggish monsters
they were from the first few releases.
The browser also got some attention
in this iteration with Google proudly
proclaiming that Android now has the
fastest mobile browser and now comes
packing in-browser Flash support
while working smoothly with HTML5,
something that the Google execs have
rightful reason to crow about.
In addition, the release also has a
slew of new features designed to make
it easier for both developers and users
to manage the apps they download,
from auto-updates to a new web-based
Android market. Google has been very
open about the fact that these im-
provements have been made keeping
developers in mind, seemingly look-
ing to expand the Android Market to
a size comparable to that of the incred-
ibly successful iPhone App Store. That
said, it has also managed to throw in
a sizeable number of new features
for users too, with a revamped media
player, on-demand movie streaming,
Exchange support and app storage on
external media.
All the signs seem to be pointing to
2010 being the year in which Android
makes it big. Slow unsteady begin-
nings haven’t deterred Google from
persevering with the operating system,
and the results have been impressive.
With a range of major hardware manu-
facturers throwing themselves behind
Android, there seems to be a consen-
sus that Android is the way forward
in an industry looking for an answer
to the ambitious expansion of Apple’s
product line. Froyo is certainly a firm
step in the right direction from Goog-
le, with enough for both the consumer
and the developer to be a very success-
ful release. The number of Android
products to be released over the next
year is a testament to the confidence
that manufacturers have in this license
free platform. So if you’re looking for a
handset that’s cheaper and more versa-
tile than the iPhone, you should defi-
nitely give Android a good look.
T
ablets all around us! Yes, it
seems just like the netbook
before them, tablets are go-
ing to be the must have PC
in the home. Problem is for the most
part the tablets that we’ve seen and are
on sale now aren’t all that cheap. From
the iPad at £429 the prices essentially
go up. Still that’s the price you pay for
bleeding edge, next generation tech
right? Yes, but more often than not
we’re not seeing bleeding edge, revolu-
tionary or even evolutionary tech.
Most of the non-ARM based tablets
pack the ubiquitous and often tedious
Intel Atom CPUs. OK, if you want to
run Windows or another desktop OS
then you’re going to have to use the
x86 instruction set, which lumbers you
with the Atom unless you’re willing to
go the way of the Core 2 Duo CULV
(that’s Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage
for those at home), which often lum-
bers you with sky high price tags.
Intel’s ‘Oak Trail’ Atom based Sys-
tem-on-a-chip, SoC for short, is on its
way into tablets in the Q1 2011 time
frame. Similar to Intel’s ‘Moorestown’
SoC, which is aimed at smartphones,
Intel is hoping that by combining the
CPU with a full chipset all on one piece
of silicon it will allow thinner, power
sipping, fanless tablets with the op-
tion of running Windows 7 along with
other OSs like Chrome OS or MeeGo.
Talking of Chrome OS, it looks like
we’re going to see Google’s cloud com-
puting, tablet orientated operating
system this autumn on devices. It’s
likely that Google will push out a beta
version of Chrome OS in the interim,
possibly even around Apple’s WWDC
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
W
hat did this past
week in tech
hold in store for
us all then?
Well it’s been tablet fever
over at the geekfest that is
Computex this week. After
the iPad launch last week here
in the UK, we’re now hearing
about a true cornucopia of new
slate devices.
First up we’ve got the ExoPC
Slate, an 11.6 inch Windows 7
tablet running a custom soft-
ware layer that is both unique
and incredibly easy to navigate.
Of note here is that if you do
need the full Windows 7 expe-
rience, it’s just behind the
gloss of
the Connect Four style inter-
face. The device is powered
by a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N450
backed up by 2GB of RAM
and a 32GB SSD. They’ve even
managed to squeeze in two
USB ports, an SD card slot,
an HDMI out, a webcam and
Broadcom’s Crystal HD chip
for 1080p playback. The touch-
screen itself is capacitive and
sports a 1366x768 resolution
making it 720p. If you’re after
a full Windows 7 experience in
a slate form factor this might
be your best bet, but we’re only
talking 3ish hours of battery
life here so best make whatever
you’re doing quick.
Asus was out in force
at Computex, this
year with its Eee Pad
range. The 12 inch
EP121 sports
an Intel Core
2 Duo CULV
CPU, Windows 7 and a pur-
ported 10 hours battery life. 10
hours is pretty ambitious for
a full desktop OS tablet, but
Asus has had experience with
its EeePC line at reaching en-
viable battery life so I wouldn’t
put it past them. Just don’t ex-
pect it to be all that svelte hav-
ing to pack a sizable battery.
Also onboard the EP121 will
be a webcam and ‘at least’ one
USB port.
Asusalsohada10inchNvidia
Tegra powered tablet running
Windows Embedded Compact
7, which is Microsoft’s new OS
for ARM powered devices that
aren’t phones, but also aren’t
powerful
enough
for a full
Windows 7
install. Other
details are a bit
sketchy at this
time but both Eee Pads will
range in the $399 to $499 price
bracket on launch. Just don’t
hold your breath for these be-
cause we’re looking down the
barrel of a Q1 2011 release
window.
If you were looking for some-
thing to take down digital notes
on, perhaps Asus’ Eee Tablet
(not Eee Pad) will fit the bill.
Rather unusually, it packs an 8
inch 1024x768 greyscale TFT-
LCD touchscreen without a
backlight, meaning that it’s
similar in appearance to
E-ink just without the
atrocious refresh
rate. Asus is really
pushing this as
a note
tak-
ing device
with a
2450 dpi
input sen-
sitivity, a 2MP camera on the
back for snapping lecture slides
and a MicroSD slot. It’s got 10
hours battery life, so it’s not in
the E-ink class, but it should
present text books and eBooks
pretty well with the ability to
make hand drawn notes at the
same time. The Eee Tablet will
be priced in the $199 to $299
bracket and will launch in Sep-
tember ready for the back-to-
school season.
MSI wasn’t to be outdone
by its Thai com-
patriot outing
two tablets of its
own. First up we’ve
got the 10 inch, Intel
Atom powered, Win-
dows 7 Home Premium
packing WindPad 100.
The ubiquitous 1.66GHz
Atom Z530 CPU is backed
up by 2GB of RAM and a
32GB SSD, whilst harbour-
ing two USB ports, an HDMI
output and a built-in webcam.
MSI have included their Wind
Touch UI, a basic skin on top
of the Windows OS providing
easy access to applications on
the 1024x600 capacitive touch-
screen, which should make
using the finger un-friendly
Windows 7 a little bit easier to
manage.
MSI also showed an Android,
Tegra 2 powered 10 inch slate
with a more curvaceous look,
which will be aimed at the end
of the year for $399.
Slick as a Slate;
Thin as a Tablet

time frame, to steal some thunder.
The problem with Chrome OS, as far
as I see it, is Google’s other pretty suc-
cessful mobile OS, Android. As you’ve
read from Feroz, Android is coming of
age and is finally at the point of being a
mature mobile platform. Why is Goog-
le trying to split the market with its
Chrome OS? We’ve already seen An-
droid running on tablets, smartphones
and smartbooks, powered either by
ARM or x86 CPUs. Why doesn’t
Google just stick with Android and put
the thoughts and UI paradigm from
what it’s trying to do with Chrome OS
into the little green machine?
If you want an example of a decent,
albeit small, tablet running Android
you’ve only got to look at the recently
released Dell Streak. It’s a 5 inch mo-
bile device that does everything your
phone does, but has just enough screen
real-estate to make it as a small tablet.
In fact, the pretty impressive Dell
Streak has been in the news this week
for two very good reasons. Carphone
Warehouse are selling the Streak on its
own for £429, but it’s available gratis
with a £25 per month data contract or
£35 per month voice and data contract.
Of course O2 is the official carrier of
the Dell Streak, but its price plans
haven’t been announced at the time of
going to print. Considering how much
the Nexus One and iPhone 3GS cost
on contract, the Streak looks like a
veritable bargain, something that’s re-
inforced, quite literally, by the amazing
Gorilla glass that protects the device’s
display. It’s able to take a full force
stab with a ball point pen with nary-a-
scratch. Impressive stuff indeed.
