is so much more than paint-by-
numbers and undersexed physicists
writing love-poems to girls on
the Tube. It in fact has a long and
highly-coloured past.
PHOENIX was founded in 1887 by
Imperial alumnus Herbert George
Wells, one of the founding fathers
of science fiction. Author, futurist,
essayist, historian, socialist,
teacher, Wells remains best known
for a string of books written at the
beginning of his career including
The Time Machine (1895), The
Island of Doctor Moreau (1896)
and The War of the Worlds
(1898) which toy with the ideas
of humanity gone fantastically,
scientifically awry.
Wells was spawned from humble
beginnings, born into poverty in
Bromley on September 21, 1866.
He later won a scholarship to the
Normal School of Science, what
is now Imperial’s Royal School of
Science.
His Imperial years marked the
origins of his interest in social
reform, and Wells soon turned to
contemporary ideas of socialism
as expressed by the Fabian Society,
an intellectual socialist movement
which is now a vanguard think-tank
of New Labour. In 1887, he founded
PHOENIX (then called The Science
School Journal) which allowed him
to express his views on literature
andsocietybutalsoprovidedabasis
for his fledgling career in fiction:
the first version The Time Machine
was published in PHOENIX under
the title, The Chronic Argonauts.
Major kudos to PHOENIX here.
This year was also the last year of
his studies; although Wells had
successfully passed in biology and
physics, a lack of interest in geology
(understandable?) meant he failed
and lost his scholarship. Never fear,
Wells still earned a BSc in Zoology
from the University of London
External Programme, even if it
wasn’t until 1890.
I’ve definitely developed a bit of
a soft spot for Herbert. There’s
nothing I hate more than crippling
stereotypes of your standard
Imperial student. Apparently we
don’t do art, literature, philosophy,
politics or have a personality...
PHOENIX fucks the stereotype
and is a massive kick in the teeth to
all them haters; don’t forget to pick
it up and spread some of Herbert’s
art-love.
