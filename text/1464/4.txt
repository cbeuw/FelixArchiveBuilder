FAIRYTALE
C
laire wanted a photoshoot like no other. So last summer, she
grabbed Peter for photoshoot that was as kaleidoscopic and
surreal as a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film.
“I personally wanted it to be sort of a colourful picture book telling a
story about a princess and a prince,” Claire said.
The photographer is Xiaojie (䚗‫)ػ‬, a friend of Claire who majored in
photography. Breaking off from the stereotyped studio photoshoots
(monotonous, thousand pieces of the same tune, declares Claire),they
travelled to amusement parks, rooftops and abandoned railway tracks
for the shoot.
Peter was in an especially jovial mood when the top photo was
taken. “He was jumping around like a monkey and the photographer
captured those precious moment,” Claire recalled. “I guess that was
one of Peter’s special happy mood filled with his young spirit!”
“We then switched to the captain and sailor roles in the railway set,
but we couldn’t find a “ship” handy, so we came up with the idea
of using those railway tracks instead. Those
bit of the tracks were not in use anymore,
otherwise we would be in serious danger!”
Though each set is starkly different from
each other, there is theme that underlies
all of them. “We came up with the idea
of a fairytale prince and princess. I guess
the word “fairytale” emanates from the
costumes and lighting effects, especially
in the set taken on the rooftop of an
apartment.”Claire explained.
The pictures may tell of a fairytale, but it
also conveys the harmony and peace of
“east meets west” concludes Claire. 
