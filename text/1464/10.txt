PAUL
GARTON
GOES TO
SPACE
T
o become an as-
tronaut, you must
know physics, so
Paul buys three
heavy textbooks
at the Barnes and
Noble in town. He straps them to
the back of his bicycle with the lov-
ing tenderness of a parent buckling
in their youngest child.
To become an astronaut, you
must be fit, so Paul runs three miles
down the road daily to meet his fa-
ther’s car coming back from work.
At the weekend, he just keeps run-
ning until he has to catch the bus
home. He leans his head right back,
sweat-drenched and sticking to the
PVC on the back seat, panting at
the sky as it keeps pace on the oth-
er side of the window. Invariably,
it is a patched-and-washed, faded
jeans, Indiana blue.
“That’s Jack Garton’s boy,” says
Mrs. Patterson, a couple of rows
down, nudging her dozing hus-
band. “He’s going to go into space.”
Mr. Patterson wriggles from her
sharp elbows. His voice is a whole-
some snarl of phlegm. “What’s he
gonna do? Run there?”
Paul Garton reads and he runs.
And he reads. And he runs. When-
ever he can, in between these two
things, he tilts back his head and
looks up.

If you ask me to pinpoint the exact
time I decided to go into space, it
probably wasn’t Saturday after-
noon at the planetarium with my
father when I was five. Neither
was it dressing up as Neil Arm-
strong for Halloween in 1971. The
exact time I decided to go into
space was 1973, when John Glenn
had been on the lecture circuit for
about four months and ended up in
Wayne County. 1973 was the year
when John Glenn stopped by his
old colleague Henry Duke’s, shared
a beer with him on the front porch
and met my eyes in the middle of
his talk the next afternoon at the
town hall.
I remember the sky had been
perfectly clear that day and that
I had stuck my arm up in the air.
John Glenn must have picked it out
in that crowded room: that seven-
year old’s arm, earnest and unblem-
ished, stretching to the moulded
ceiling plaster like a sapling.
“What is it, son?” John Glenn
turned his keen eye on me. These
were the same eyes that had sur-
veyed our earth as a whole; these
were the eyes of the man who’d
shot from the ground and floated
on the periphery, watching whilst
we were putting our kids on school
buses and reading the morning
news. I had almost cracked my
wrist on the plastic chairs, snatch-
ing back my arm so quickly.
“What was it like, sir?”
John Glenn grinned. He sank
back into his chair a little, fold-
ed his arms across his chest and
grinned.
“You know, every time I’m asked
this question, I try to find better
words to answer it with,” he said.
“But I still haven’t found anything
that quite does it justice.” Then he
looked straight at me and it was
one of those moments of complete
epiphanic clarity that other people
might write love songs about.
“You’ve really got to go and see it
for yourself,” he said.
A man cleared his throat at the
back of the room, as though he
wanted to add something, but
changed his mind. This man was
Henry Duke, Wayne County’s very
own astronaut, but I didn’t turn
around, I didn’t even know who
Henry Duke was. I just perched on
the edge of my plastic chair and my
heart thumped. I was seven years
old then, but I wouldn’t be forever.
One day, I’d be seeing the world as
