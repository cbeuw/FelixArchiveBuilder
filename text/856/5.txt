The International Paint Travel Award Scheme run by Courtaulds Coatings
has, since 1985, enabled a total of 35 student prize winners to travel around the
world. This year we are again offering ten individual Â£1,000 travel awards to
undergraduates with a real interest in an industrial career and the imagination to
organise an out of the ordinary overseas vacation next summer. Part of the trip will
include a visit to one of our overseas operations - the rest of the time is yours. The
competition is open to all first degree University students who are prepared to put
in a little application.
