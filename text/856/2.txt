If you want to be
a Captain of Industry,
shouldn't you first
learn to navigate? _
They say it's tough at the top. But it's tougher
still getting there if you don't have some basic
skills to support you. Some of those skills will
come with an accountancy qualification, the rest
with the Ernst & Young training programme.
We are one of the leading financial advisoryfirmsin
the world. Which means we have a wide range of

How do you know an accountancy qualification will
help you? Take a look at many of the Captains of
Industry today. And take a look at the course they took
getting there. Their qualification may not be the only
reason they got where they are. But it certainly helped.
