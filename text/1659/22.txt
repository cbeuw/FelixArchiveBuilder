This week you decide
to run in the union
elections but your
name’s RON. Tough
luck.

This week you’re
Rob Garside and
assault one of the
candidates on Live TV.
#voteicu
This week you’re
Tessa Davey and
you’ve been at
Imperial for almost
a decade. You might
not be a medic, but
you’ve certainly slept
with more than enough
of them. Well done.
#voteicu
This week you
try and message
Crushperial but end
up posting on your
crush’s Facebook wall.
Worst social media
fuckup since those
‘problematic’ tweets
from Lucinda. #voteicu
This week you go
#large at ACC and
decide to sleep in
the kit room in the
West Basement. You
awake to find that
mountaineering have
taken you up Ben
Nevis.
This week you’re La
La Land! No, wait,
you’re Moonlight!
Hang on, actually
you’re Batman vs
Superman. And you’re
shit.
This week you end up at
a house party. You wake
up with two road signs, a
photo album and half a
bannister in your bed.
This week you
download Tinder but
as you’re an Imperial
student you decide you
need an edge. Hit the
Gym? Brush up on your
flirting? Nah, hack the
algorithm.
This week,
predictably, you get
drunk. You’re a fucking
mess. Sort your life
out. After that pint I
guess.
This week you realise
that Heathrow’s new
runway is a great
idea! You’ll be able to
not afford to jet away
somewhere exotic
even quicker now!
This week you decide
to make friends the
unconventional way
by posing as the ICU
Returning Officer. Crafty.
#voteicu
This week you decide
to win the elections
using military force. It
works! ALL HAIL YOUR
NEW OVERLORD.

CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
Two of my closest friends colluded behind my back to
nominate me in the upcoming leadership elections. (I knew
I should never have given them my college ID, but how did
they guess my password was Ilikespankings?). Unfortunately,
the policy that would have allowed me to pull out has lapsed,
and I am now the only candidate for junior assistant council
quorum counter. However, I am not ready for such a responsi-
bility. I fear responsibility so badly, I ran out of home the day
I was given control over my allowance. I despise it so much, I
take a baby-sitter to ACC night. But I like curly fries too much
to flee Imperial and start a new life as a Peer of the House of
Lords. What should I do?
Sincerely,
Tom Floyd
Dear Floyd,
I think I met your baby sitter at an ACC!
Arguably, I do not remember everything,
but you chose her well: she facesitted on my
babyface, and it was amazing. I ended up
throwing up my liquid intake of the night, but
she had thankfully gotten off me (and gotten
off in general) by then. Anyway, I should
really find something that holds to the stomach
better. Maybe those new pre-pulled pints will
go down better, since they lack the fizz. Or
maybe I should stick to Jäeger.
Anyway, that is to say I will vote for anybody
who promises to add hard drugs inside drinks,
since I have found they make the musical selec-
tion at Metric bearable. I am even prepared
to accept a surcharge, although I won’t budge
on the whole “we don’t take your credit card if
it’s covered in cocaine, Sir” thing. I mean, how
HOROSCOPES
dare they assume my gender ?
Anyway, to address your problem, I think you
overlooked the obvious answer. If you are in
charge of counting quorum, and you don’t
show up, who will count you as absent? So
enjoy the elections, the results party (can you
bring your baby sitter with you again?) and
don’t take your new job seriously: I mean,
none of the sabbs do, clearly.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
