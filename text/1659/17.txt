T
his is, without a
doubt, a truly
phenomenal
game. Created
by the minds over
at genDESIGN
(previously Team ICO), it
bears a striking resemblance
to both of their previous
games, Ico and Shadow
of the Colossus. In Ico you
played a boy guiding a
helpless young girl through
a castle in an attempt to
escape, while Shadow
of the Colossus tasks you
with finding and killing 16
monstrous beasts. Despite
being so different, the two
games seem intrinsically
linked and The Last Guardian
seems to be a marriage of
the two, as you partner with
a massive beast to escape a
ruined castle.
It all begins as you, a young
boy, awaken in a dark, damp
cave with a giant creature
named Trico imprisoned at
your side. Before you learn
anything about the beast or
the situation you find yourself
in, you are compelled to free
him and nurse him back to
health in an act of empathy
and kindness that goes on to
define the entire game. As
you interact with Trico, you
notice that he has spears
lodged in the gaps of the
and beast is the driving force
of the entire game; Trico is
your only means of dispatch-
ing the eerie, ghost-like suits
of armour that hunt you, and
time and time again you must
place your life in his ability
to do so. On the flip side, the
boy can progress to areas
where Trico cannot, open
passages to move further, and
bring back barrels of food to
nurse Trico back to health.
Trico is the real star of
the game. He is incredibly
detailed, and seems to be
an amalgamation of several
different creatures. His
feathers ruffle individually in
the wind, and he is incredibly
expressive; his facial expres-
sions and body language tell
you a lot about any situation
you are in. His eyes change
colour when he is angry, he
will look at you with wide
eyes and tilt his head when
curious, and he will sit on his
hind legs and make plaintive
cries when he can’t find
you. He gets injured and
heals slowly as you progress
through the story; any spears
you leave lodged in him will
stay there throughout the
entire game. Trico truly feels
alive. When you look into his
eyes after you’ve managed
to escape a particularly dan-
gerous situation, you don’t
see the code or the artificial
characterisation that defines
most video game characters.
You see an honest portrayal
of an intricate, living thing.

armour, and is shackled by a
metal collar. After attempt-
ing to help by removing the
first spear, he does not take
kindly to your presence and
lashes out, knocking the boy
unconscious. However, your
continued efforts to help after
you awaken eventually pay
off; the spears are removed,
the collar is unlocked and his
armour falls to the ground.
The creature is freed, and thus
your journey begins.
At first, Trico is wary and

in traversing the landscape,
and needs to be coaxed into
helping by using food barrels
that are found lying around.
However, this relationship
slowly builds until the boy is
able to give basic commands,
and eventually the pivotal
moment arrives when you
must trust Trico with your life,
as you jump off a platform
hoping he will catch you as
you plummet into the abyss
below. Near the end of the
story this bond is so great that
Trico actively nuzzles the boy
with his head, and is greatly
troubled when he can’t see
you. The bond between boy

strange; they feel tactile, yet
also rather clunky. The but-
tons are mapped to directions
meaning triangle is jump
and X is crawl, taking after
Shadow of the Colossus and,
generally, older Japanese
games. There’s a heft involved
in every action you perform,
as the boy struggles notice-
ably to pick up barrels and
climb ledges, making every
action feel more meaningful.
The camera is also incredibly
frustrating at times, seeming
to not work very well at all in
close-quarters.
I realise that these flaws will
be more than enough to make
people pass this game up, or
at least will massively affect
their enjoyment. However,
the bond you build with Trico
feels natural and organic,
and its execution is sublime.
As the game drew to its close,
this unspoken bond far out-
weighed any of the flaws I felt
the game had and because
of this, I truly believe The Last
Guardian one of the best
games of the past decade.
