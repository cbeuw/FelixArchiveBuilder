Where did all the election candidates go?
Could marketing efforts be behind poor nomination numbers?

Trustee positions so the role
is technically uncontested).
But it’s also a bad year for
Constituent Unions, with
only six students running for
President across all constituent
unions (ICSMU is considered
a sabbatical position and not
taken into account here). The
Presidential roles of the RCSU
and RSMU are uncontested.
On the plus side, we’re
seeing a spike of interest in
the Liberation roles, including
two candidates contesting
the newly established
Mental Health Officer role.
Andriopoulos said: “One of
the most pleasing things about
this set of elections is the
number of candidates running
for Liberation Officer roles,
which now includes the new
Mental Health Officer. All of
these positions are contested
by some very experienced,
passionate candidates and
this suggests good things for
campaigning in the future.”

Elections, as revealed by the

Despite boasting over 700
candidates and “Britain’s most
active student democracy”,
representation for some of
the major positions has been
disappointing.
Last year, saw a record
breaking 32 candidates
running for one of the full-
time sabbatical positions,
including eleven students
contesting the Union President
role and nine contesting the
Deputy President Welfare role
(DPW). On the other hand, no
one actually ran for Deputy
President for Finance and
Services in the first round of
elections last year.
This year in comparison,
there are only 21 students
running for sabbatical
positions. From those, only
thirteen can realistically be
consideredseriouscandidates.
Particularly in the case of
Union President, arguably
the most prestigious role
available, only one candidate
has bothered supplying a
headshot or a manifesto, with
the rest having presumably
missed the deadline. Though
since, four candidates have
oficially pulled out of the race.
We reached out to them to
enquire on the reasons behind
their incomplete campaign
but have not received any
comment.Whether this will
work to the advantage of the
candidate who has provided
a manifesto, or to their
detriment, causing a RON (re-
opening of nominations) vote
cascade remains to be seen.
Union President, Nas
Andriopoulos said: “All of the
sabbatical roles, including
ICSMSU President and
FELIX, are contested and
have some strong candidates
from various backgrounds
within the Union. Following
last year’s bumper crop of
candidates, I am saddened
that more students have not
nominated themselves, and I
am especially disappointed
that more of the Presidential
candidates did not submit a
manifesto. It is obviously less
than ideal for our democracy,
but none of these elections are
appointments and I would like
to remind voters that they can
vote to Re-open Nominations
(RON)”
One Union source that would
like to remain anonymous
blames it on marketing efforts,
which haven’t been as strong
as last year in the time leading
to the closure of nominations.
“I can’t say they started it late,
but compared to previous
years, the marketing came
out a lot later. They did only
do workshops around the last
week of nominations. I can see
that affecting people on the
border of running or [people
who are] not Union-involved,
because it takes longer to
convince these people to do it.
Quite often these are some of
the people who would be best
for the job because they have
the right amount of self-doubt
to push themselves. They tend
to entirely do it because they
care and they love it.”
This year also marks a
five year low for Council
Chair and Student Trustee
candidates, with only two
students contesting each
role (there are two Student
