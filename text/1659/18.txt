Life in the blogosphere #tablesituation
You might envy the food bloggers of
the instagram world - all those lovely
free meals, cocktails and socialising
with the hip and trendy from across
the culinary scene. An insiders view
shows that it’s sometimes a bit more
superficial, but you’ll still probably
be jealous at the end, sorry.
G
osh, what a
morning, I
thought to
myself as I
landed on a
lush, green,
velvet chair, flushed and out
of breath from an intense
power walking session down
Park Lane (my definition of
being ‘fashionably late’).
A fellow blogger sitting
opposite was doing her 5th
re-run on Snapchat: “…it’s
too early in the morning to
do this without a filter…”
Other bloggers purred at
each other, exchanging
delicate kisses on cheeks and
Instagram-perfect smiles.
It is always events like this
that makes my inner introvert
feel... out of place. My com-
bination of typical Chinese
features, black hair, small
eyes and all, was an anomaly
amongst the sea of blonde
hair, bronzed cheeks and lips
tinted with the most-hyped
MLBB (My Lips But Better)
colour on Youtube. Being a
third year Chemical Engineer-
ing student at Imperial didn’t
help either – conversations
were better kept away from
a 20-year old’s daunting
coursework deadlines and
back to London Fashion Week
and brand-sponsored trips
abroad.
This morning wasn’t any
different from the rest of the 8
am press breakfasts scribbled
in my schedule. Except for a
change in environment. I was
sitting in Boisdale of Mayfair
on North Row, a restaurant
serving British food, a rarity
in the area. The room, con-
verted from a listed stable,
was decorated in their distinc-
tive, classy interior of red and
dark green walls, chandeliers
and mahogany tables.
After catching up with the
latest restaurant openings
and Trump’s rants on Twitter, I
escaped from the crazy world
outside to study the breakfast
menu in an elegant, black,
art deco font: lobster eggs
benedict, haggis, Devonshire
crab omelettes, devilled veal
kidneys. A pancake menu
was also available in time
for Pancake Day, featuring
smoked salmon, scrambled
duck eggs all the way to dry
aged sirloin steak (yes, on
pancakes). Interesting.
The waitress, slightly flus-
tered by the never-ending
buzz of demands from the
only table that morning, took
our orders and left us to con-
tinue on the blogger chit chat
for another half-hour.
The food arrived when the
caffeine had finally seeped
into my brain. What followed
was the scene that you’ll
never, ever see through that
static, photoshopped square
on Instagram.
Like any other event, I was
ready for their arrival – my
trusty DSLR on my right, my
iPhone logged on to Insta-
gram Story mode on my left.
I was, of course, not the only
one. The table of bloggers
all stood up like meerkats,
phones and cameras ready,
making way for the breakfast
plates, pushing away stained
napkins and water glasses,
fighting for the spot with the
best natural light, positioning
the food for the perfect #flat-
lay shot.
Perfectly poached Burford
Brown eggs were carefully
sliced open to reveal that
river of bright orange #yolk-
porn. An artistically cut ruby
grapefruit was shuffled across
the table to give that contrast-
ing pop of colour against the
green crushed avocado and
buttercup yellow hollandaise
sauce. You could hear shutter
sounds from the cameras, like
a machine gun shooting at
the beautiful plate of smoked
salmon crepes that was
ordered “just for photos”.
This continued for another
10 minutes until each social
media account was satisfied.
By then, the food has gone
cold, per usual. I picked up
my knife and fork, slicing the
caramelized banana on my
hazelnut praline pancake.
The spongy pancake had
soaked up the melted vanilla
ice cream, still delicious
despite the prolonged photo-
shooting session.
The meal phased out as
fellow bloggers began to rush
off for their next event. Shame
– half the dishes were left
unfinished. A typical #tablesit-
uation in the blogging world.
And a typical snapshot of
my morning from the eyes of
a blogger.

The ugly truth behind food waste
Sadly, it has to be said that we are
a wasteful species - and this is often
most apparent on our plates. We’ve
got some ideas as to how you can
change that, and why you should
bother doing so.
T
here is no way
of denying it: we
overproduce.
Constantly. We
throw. Shamelessly.
We waste.
Consciously. Every day,
tonnes of food are thrown
away simply because some
food legislation has put a
standardized limit ‘eat before’
date or due to surplus. Worse,
because we buy more than
we really need. However,
for catering companies,
restaurants and cafés, for
which food waste is a daily
issue, acknowledging it is still
something inconsiderable. As
if by admitting a truth we all
know – although we refuse
to believe it ourselves – it
would expose them to shame,
customers’ disapproval and
ultimately to bankruptcy.
It is outrageous how our
modern society, one of
overproduction and fierce
consumerism, has allowed
such a phenomenon to build
in throughout the past years.
The more we produce, the
more extra we produce.
Competition between brands
has led to overproduction
at minimal costs, with little
benefit to the companies who
first started this strategy. The
consumers themselves – that
is, us – are not left untouched
either, constantly manipu-
lated by massive advertising
campaigns and never-ending
varieties to choose from,
producing a crowd that is
completely lost in the ocean
of quantity – often over qual-
ity, but that is another story to
be told.
The saying goes, ‘you are
what you eat’. It isn’t about
being a foodie; it’s about
being an educated, responsi-
ble one. You cannot pretend
to be passionate about food
without considering the food
chain as a whole and measur-
ing its impact not only on our
society, but on our ecosystem
as a whole. How about what
we don’t eat, about what we
guiltlessly throw away? It
seems so ironic how students
often complain about tiny
budgets when so much of
their grocery shopping goes
to waste. On a low budget,
we tend to choose quantity
over quality, and students are
the first victims of this vicious
cycle. Bigger packages offer
deals that outcompete any
individual offer. Yet, I spend
less than any of my friends
on food. Around £10, up
to £15 a week. That’s right,
one five. Fair enough, I
am vegetarian with vegan
aspirations; I am a not-that-
tall (hey not so-short-either
though) girl. But let’s look at
it from another perspective.
I tend to go for high quality
products, organic whenever
I can. Moreover, I love nuts.
I’m absolutely nuts about
nuts. And my favourite way of
spending a chill evening is to
bake. All these should signifi-
cantly increase the cost of my
shopping list, and hence coun-
terbalance the advantages of
my diet.
So how to minimize your
food expenses without
starving yourself? There is
no secret to it. Only rational
thinking, which most of us, as
scientists, would be expected
to have. And a relentless
will to radically change our
current mentality. Start with
Sarah Kakadellis
buying local, and seasonal.
Strawberries in February will
of course cost you thrice as
much as they would in June,
if not more. Choose your
products yourself, rather than
already packaged. You’d be
amazed to see how cheaper
the very same tomatoes are
when you pick them alone.
Buy ‘simple’, non-processed
food. It’s not that hard to
make your own morning por-
ridge with basic ingredients
rather than buy the ‘ready
to eat’ package. Besides,
doesn’t food taste so much
better when it is homemade?
This article isn’t about dic-
tating the lifestyle you ought
to adopt. Mine alone is far
from being perfect. It is about
raising questions. About start-
ing to be aware of what we
consume, or rather how we
do so. Last year I joined an
app that shares leftovers by
a means of bringing the local
community together and pre-
venting food waste. I realized
one thing, a simple equation:
sharing food equals sharing
happiness. It feels like you
won the lottery when you pick
up free food from someone
else. It feels even better when
you give away what you
would otherwise throw away
and there is this feeling of
achievement too. By putting
in common what one wants to
get rid of when someone else
craves for the same thing,
a whole common project of
sustainability emerges. And
there is nothing more empow-
ering than building a more
sustainable future together.
Before you chuck your
wrinkly apples, why don’t you
give them another chance
and treat yourself or your
friends with a delicious apple
crumble or turn the potatoes
and carrots that have been
lying around for way too long
into a creamy carrot soup?
These recipes will fill your
palate and your mind – as
well as your wallet – with
joy. And next time you see
that really tempting offer
at the shop, think about all
the yummy food at home
that still waits to be eaten
with love. For the love of our
planet, start sharing food and
preventing food waste. Food
tastes much better when it is
shared – or when it is free.
