Labour has a
one way ticket
to Switzerland
Charles Titmuss explains why Labour
is doomed – and it's not all Jeremy
Corbyn's fault
T
he by-elections
in both Stoke
and Copeland
were both called
recently, due to
their respective MPs
resigning. As I’m sure you
are aware, Labour lost the
Copeland seat and held on
to the Stoke seat, but suffered
a reduction in the proportion
of votes compared to 2015.
This is viewed by many, myself
included, as a crucial test
of Labour’s appeal to the
general public, particularly
at a transformative time in
Labour’s history.
Labour is of course under the
leadership of Jeremy Corbyn,
for some he is a saviour and
hero of the left, and for others,
he is its damnation. Many
have linked his leadership
to Labour’s struggle in the
polls, blaming his inconsistent
position on the EU, his weak
stance on defence and NATO
and his association with the
left wing group Momentum,
as well as the anti-Semitism
scandal in the Labour Party.
Others, most recently John
Mcdonnell, have blamed the
lack of unity in the Labour
party, such as Tony Blair’s
criticism of his leadership, as
\\ Before the Labour
Party elected Jere-
my, it was already in
crisis \\
well as other criticism from
within the Labour Party. It is
important to note that since
Jeremy’s election, there have
been 11 by-elections, of which
only 1 has been a loss for
Labour.
When examining the current
situation Labour is in, it is
important to contextualise
these results: they are by-
elections and are not an
indicator of how the nation
will vote in three years’ time.
With any luck, May will make
domestic and foreign policy
errors, and there is usually a
trend towards unpopularity
for the ruling party as its reign
comes to an end.
However, it is possible to
say that Labour is not in a
good place. This is the first
time since 1982 that an
opposition party has lost a
seat to the governing party in
a by-election. In a recent poll
(Opinium/Observer), Labour
was predicted to win 30%
of the votes compared to the
Conservatives' 38%, likely
leading to a large election
loss. Whether Jeremy is
entirely to blame for these low
polling figures is the matter of
contention.
I would argue that before the
Labour Party elected Jeremy,
it was already in crisis. It had
lost the 2015 election – to a
coalition and a Tory party
that pushed through hard line
austerity as its policy – and
it had lost critical political
capital to the SNP and UKIP.
Jeremy wouldn’t have even
been in contention if this were
not the case. Labour under
the leadership of Tony Blair
and Gordon Brown taking
the UK into the Iraq War,
into Afghanistan, and most
crucially through the 2008
Great Recession has greatly
impacted Labour’s image.
The impression that Labour is
not good for the economy has
stuck, and the perception that
the Conservatives played a
major role in cleaning up the
mess is prevalent. Labour is
still viewed by many as a pro-
globalisation, pro-free market
party, and in the aftermath of
Brexit, this is a less electable
position.
Jeremy Corbyn has not been
able to shift this image that
Labour is bad for the economy.
He has simply added some
extra problems that make
\\ Jeremy is a man

Labourevenmoreunelectable,
chief among them that he
is not a strong or effective
leader. He has been unable to
reconcile those members of his
party that were not part of the
membership explosion that
resulted in his election and
has also supported policies
and positions that do not
appeal to traditional Labour
voters. Essentially, Jeremy is
currently attempting to run the
party in order to please the
membership that elected him,
as opposed to acknowledging
that the wider electorate
has much broader desires
than those of the Corbynistas
that form the base of his
support. Jeremy is a man of
principle, but it takes a man of
compromise to be an effective
politician and account for all
points of view.
In my view, Labour
winning the next election
was always a long shot, for
all the reasons previously
mentioned. Unfortunately,
the voters to whom Jeremy
wants to appeal – the young
and disenfranchised – do not
vote in force historically and
he is only further alienating
those that would vote for him
with his policies on Brexit,
Trident, and the fact that he
lacks the abilities of a leader
that could truly unite the left
and oust the Tories. A more
reasonable expectation would
be too ensure that an effective
opposition is maintained,
but he is simply failing in
that regard, and a lack of
opposition can be devastating
to the democratic process.
Of course the title of this
article is inflammatory. I’m
not really suggesting that
he should register for the
Dignitas™ treatment, but
looking at it this way, Labour
was already on life support,
and Jeremy is helping to
assure that the Labour Party
is on the train to Bern. He
really is committed to leading
the party through thick and
thin, he will be there to hold
its hand as it drifts off into the
black abyss of irrelevance.

Trump's cabinet
is cleverer than
you think
Alexander Luisi compares the language
used by Trump's administration and the
Party in Orwell's 1984
T
he language
of the Trump
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n
fascinates me. The
daily barrage of
comments, tweets
and press conferencesreveals
something quite fundamental
about the way that the
government is operating, and
how it will operate. It’s hard to
believe that the administration
is not in utter chaos, and what
is striking is the language used
in the information presented,
and the nature in which it
is presented. It conveys a
semblance of order and the
impression that the President
and his team are 'doing great’.
Soundfamiliar?That’sbecause
it is. The limited vocabulary of
Trump is starkly Orwellian in
nature. Groan you may – it’s
pretty cliché to compare any
aspect of any government to
that in 1984 – but aside from
illustrating totalitarianism, the
novel dealt with the nuanced
aspects of a regime that was
determined to demonstrate its
coherence to the people, so
makes for a solid comparison.
The simplicity of Trump’s
language is staggering. His
vocabulary is incredibly basic
and his sentences are very short
– it is far from that expected of
a statesman. George W. Bush
managed words with more syl-
lables. On the campaign trail
\\ Because the language is
unequivocal, it may be hard

than the given information if
taken at face value \\
this lack of linguistic ability
exposed the man as a semi-co-
herent orator with barely the
capacity for holding office.
Countless times were the words
"great", "terrible", "strong",
"weak", "winning" and "losing"
used, and always in their direct
pairs. Now in power, this
simplicity has become more
sinister and is reminiscent of
Newspeak, the language used
in Orwell’s dystopia. Its pur-
pose is to "diminish the range of
thought", to suit the ideological
needs of the Party by removing
all but the essential meaning of
words so as to prevent thought-
crime. In the case of the Trump
administration, this particular
set of words and others have
been used to the point where
they have lost all but their
bare meaning. Though com-
pletely unintentional, it would
make a lot of sense if it were
applied to suit an ideological
goal – simple language has
the benefit of concisely convey-
ing a point without ambiguity.
For example, Trump’s govern-
ment is constantly reaffirming
its position and how well it is
doing, so when Donald Trump
or his press secretary Sean
Spicer use ‘great’, they create
a façade of control, where the
situation is better than just aver-
age (which is the implication of
their use of ‘good’). With this
restricted range of words, and
therefore thought, it would
seem to the uncritical ear that
the government is functioning.
The fact that the travel ban was
implemented for several days
with government officials and
supporters alike defending it
reinforces that the actions of
the government are at face
value, as clear-cut as their
language.
Now combine this basic,
unequivocal language with
how the administration deliv-
ers information and you get a
recipe for something that is in
the same vein as the Ministry
of Truth. The persistent televi-
sion interviews with Kellyanne
Conway or Stephen Miller, as
well as the painful press confer-
ences with Sean Spicer, seem
to give different narratives as
they go and then finally agree
on a common line of thought,
somewhat akin to the work of
Orwell’s protagonist Winston
in Minitrue when he has to sift
through old news articles and
reports altering information to
suit the Party. When Oceania
changes adversaries in the
war from Eurasia to Eastasia,
the history of the perpetual
conflict is entirely rewritten,
resulting in public outrage that
Eastasia was the enemy all
along, with blind disregard for
the past. This is because of the
bare meaning of the language
and its constructs, and how it
has subsequently discouraged
thoughtcrime. A similar phe-
nomenon is happening with
Trump, his cabinet and his
supporters as a whole – per-
sonified best by “alternative
facts”. Take the recent resigna-
tion of the National Security
advisor Michael Flynn. The ini-
tial report to the media, from
Conway, was that Flynn had,
“the full confidence” of the
\\ With this

functioning \\
President but only a few hours
later, our favourite press secre-
tary declared that the situation
had become, “unsustainable”
because the Vice President
had been misled by Flynn
regarding his conversations
with the Russian Ambassador.
History wasn’t rewritten (thank-
fully there is still a free press,
almost) but this deliberate over-
sight of what was previously
announced, combined with the
quick affirmation by others in
the administration eerily resem-
bles events during Hate Week
in 1984. Because the language
is unequivocal, it may be hard
to believe anything other than
the given information if taken
at face value.
Could the language of the
Administration actually devolve
entirely into a bare-meaning
dialect like Newspeak? Its
immediate meaning certainly
portrays the current situation
with no attention to what hap-
pened previously, which makes
it so powerful from an ideolog-
ical standpoint. If Trump and
his government were to cap-
italise on this while gagging
and intimidating the media the
implications on the mind-set of
society, or at the very least his
supporters, would be ‘yuge’.
No. Instead, the reality is that
Trump has already, and will
continue to become a victim of
his own language. This could
mean four years might not be
four years after all. If it is a full
term, there’s always the memes
to look forward to.
