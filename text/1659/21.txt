pparently for the
last couple of
weeks my usual
column has been
farmed out to a
few immigrants.
On the one hand I agree with
slave labour, but the idea of giving
more work to the Chinese makes
me feel like vomiting up my own
asshole. If any of my dedicated
readers are wondering where
I have been for the past couple
of weeks, unfortunately I am not
legally allowed to say due to the
case still being in court, however,
I can tell you that it rhymes with
hexual sarassment. Honestly just a
bunch of uptight liberals being so
entrenched up their own asses that
they’re just too frigid for their own
good.
Of course big papi Trump has
been continuously slandered for
the past couple of weeks for no
apparent reason – It was a ban on
terrorists, not Muslims. If you had
actually read the executive order
then you would known that! Also
the whole ‘he’s not my president!’
vibe has gotten old and we should
finally come together and become
a unified nation. Apart from the
blacks and lesbians of course.
From one crooked election to
another, the Imperial College
Union elections have started, or
so I hear. It looks like this year’s
collection of people too inept for
a real job and medicine students
who have run out of money for the
last years of their degree promises
to be the most uneventful election
to date. If I were to predict who
would win, I would come to the
opinion that no-one gives a shit, as
long as the hot ones win.
Did anyone watch the Oscars?
Yeah me neither – if I wanted to
listen to the liberal elite complain
about a fairly elected leader, I
would read this tampon of a news-
paper. I did hear about the utter
travesty of political correctness,
however, which didn’t surprise
me, but still made me shit blood
regardless. What a surprise that
the Hollywood elite couldn’t just
let a good film win. It had to be
the SJW festival of black homos
just to prove that they’re not racist
– how about just admit it and
move on? That’s what I’ve done
and it means I don’t have to watch
moody two hour dramas about
known homosexuals crying, or
whatever they do. I was surprised,
however, because I thought that
black people couldn’t be homo-
sexuals – or is it that they can’t
swim? Anyway, Lala Land is not
overrated and should have won,
and it’s good to be back.
I
f any of you remember, when
I wrote my last column, I
had been intent on living
in isolation for the next few
years. However, I don’t think
anyone actually makes it past
the naked people in the centrefold,
so who knows if anyone actually
read that. Anyway, needless to
say, my self-enforced isolation kind
of came to a halt when I realised
that I had forgotten to bring any
coconut water for hydration,
instead I had to suck from the
teat of the sheep I brought with
me. However, I may have sucked
its (gender is as fluid as sheep
milk so please don’t forget your
pronouns) whole body dry. Well,
as a result, I may have ended up
inadvertently killing the sheep and
after a few days dead goat really
starts to stink out the place. If I had
remembered to bring my vegan
pot pourri with me then I could
have perhaps dealt with it, but
unfortunately I bought four copies
of No Logo instead. Oh well.
Now that isolating myself from
the real world has failed, I have
decided to fully embrace change
and somehow cope with the next
couple of years by learning to
take comfort in the little joys in life
– like the fact that the overrated
white-centric La La Land had their
best picture Oscar wrenched out
of their white-privileged-jazz-bro
hands in order to give it to the
superior film that is Moonlight.
Now, although I was born in
Cambridge to a local MP, that film
made me wish that I was a known
homosexual, that I was a muscled
black man, and that my mother
had a crack cocaine addiction. I
just have always identified more
with African culture than my own,
and if in the future the opportunity
to become black became available
to me I would take it faster than
you could call me Rachel Dolezal.
Another thing to take happiness
from is the fact that when the
polar ice caps eventually melt, we
will no longer have to contend
with the alt-right, racism, gourmet
burger places that don’t give you
chips when you buy a burger as
if they’re some sort of side dish,
vegan fried chicken restaurants (if
you want to be vegan, don’t try to
pretend to be all high and mighty
when you’re just trying to replace
chicken), and also sheep. I get trig-
gered every time I see one now, so
please put trigger warnings on any
farmyard related posts in future
please.
My plan failed and also
I’m triggered by sheep
now
Jonathan Masters’ plan to
relinquish this world sadly failed,
but now he is back to rejoice from
the defeat of La La Land
I’m back to liberate
my column from
foreign oppression
Monathan Jasters is back to show
you what’s up and shit all over
ICU’s elections and the Oscars
among other things
