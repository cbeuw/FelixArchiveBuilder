Danza
Contemporánea
de Cuba |
Electrifying
dance with a
Cuban flavour
C
uba’s premier
dance company
stopped by
London for one
night last week
during their
whirlwind tour of the UK.
Founded in 1959, Danza
Contemporánea de Cuba has
had over half a century to
develop its distinct aesthetic
– contemporary dance
and classical ballet, with
Spanish and Afro-Caribbean
influences. While they
have performed in London
before – at the Royal Opera
distinct gender roles, but as
the performance goes on the
boundaries between male
and female become increas-
ingly blurred, culminating in
a powerful ending where the
two genders “unite into one
single breath”.
The second piece was The
Listening Room by Clinkard,
a British choreographer.
Its concept is quite unique
– the dancers interpret a
soundtrack that they hear
through noise-cancelling
headphones, while the
audience listens to a different
track entirely. As Steve Reich’s
instrumentals filled the hall, I
could almost deceive myself
that the energetic dancing
on stage was to the same
beat. Then the audience’s
soundtrack abruptly switched
off. Despite the utter silence,
the dancing on stage con-
tinued as though nothing
had happened. It was then
that I realised the disconnect
between the dancers and the
audience. It was as though
the music was visible only
through the movements of
the dancers; watching their
free interpretations, I found
myself trying to guess what
kind of music they were really
listening to.
Finally, the evening
concluded with a piece by
Céspedes, the company’s
own in-house choreographer:
Matria Etnocentra. The piece
is something of a tribute to
Cuban identity – the regi-
mented daily life combined
with the verve and energy of
the country’s inhabitants. Mil-
itary drill-inspired formations
dominate the first section; the
regularity of the marshalled
configurations contrasts with
a later section, in which the
dancers pound their clenched
fists against their hearts. Is this
a form of social commentary
by Céspedes? The dancers

tion of Theo Clinkard's The Listening Room
\\ Adolfo Izquierdo
run off stage for a nostalgic,
yearning solo dance by Iosm-
aly Ordoñez, who then dons
a modern outfit to join the rest
of the troupe in a lively finish
with Cuban salsa rhythms.
Cuban energy runs through
the three performances
like a thread. In Reversible
and Matria Etnocentra, the
choreography is designed
specifically with the compa-
ny’s background in mind. In
Reversible, “the concept of
gender and soul is universal”
but the dancing, especially
the bachata sequences, are
particularly Cuban; in Matria
Etnocentra, the entire concept
of the piece revolves around
the social context of Cuba.
Even in The Listening Room, a
piece with very little direction
from the choreographer, it
shows through in the dancers'
own interpretations of the
music.
More than the Cuban
style it brings to the stage,
Danza Contemporánea de
Cuba is by all standards a
stellar dance company. The
three pieces showcase the
24 dancers’ versatility and
technical excellence. Every
move is executed with fluidity
and feeling, and they bring
a warmth and physicality to
the stage which is infectious
– from the grins on their
faces to the foot-stamping,
hand-clapping sequences
they spontaneously break out
into while taking their bows.
Truly an outstanding com-
pany, one I hope to see back
in London soon!

House, Sadler’s Wells, and
the Coliseum – this is their
first time on the Barbican
stage. This tour sees them
showcasing three completely
new pieces from award-
winning choreographers
Annabelle Lopez Ochoa,
Theo Clinkard, and George
Céspedes.
The evening opened with
Ochoa’s Reversible. Chore-
ographed specifically for
Danza Contemporánea de
Cuba, Ochoa’s work deals
with ideas of gender, seduc-
tion, and rivalry, with both
the male and female dancers
going topless at various
parts of the choreography.
In addition to the soundtrack
– sometimes drumbeats,
sometimes sibilant whispers,
sometimes pure silence – this
adds to the primal, almost
mystical, quality of the piece.
In one section, sensuality is
conveyed beautifully through
bachata rhythms and graceful
hip movements. Ochoa
also playfully interchanges
traditional gendered clothing:
the male dancers wear skirts
and the female dancers wear
trousers. It works surprisingly
well. The piece starts out with
the dancers expressing two
G
oing into the
National
Theatre’s
production of
Shakespeare’s
Twelfth Night,
I was expecting a slightly
less-conventional production.
I was not wrong. Director
Simon Godwin is certainly
not afraid to show us that
this is a modern play from
the off, with a flashy display
of a shiny car cruising onto
the stage piled with Orsino
(Oliver Chris) and his dapper
entourage. One lady I spoke
to noted that the production
was ‘unorthodox’, which is
saying something, considering
just how outrageous the
original play is in terms of the
themes it addresses: much
of Twelfth Night’s charm can
be attributed to its storyline,
centring around classic
cases of mistaken identity
and complicated, mutating
love polygons, of which
Shakespeare is undoubtedly
a master of.
The name of the play itself
refers to the last night of
Christmas, on which ridicule is
supposed to ensue – hus-
bands swapping roles with
wives and so forth. It is per-
haps appropriate therefore,
that the most striking addition
to this production is Malvo-
lio’s replacement by Tamsin
Greig’s Malvolia, cementing
this production’s status as a
very modern take on a play
that itself was well ahead of
its time – not only due to the
more modern costumes and
scenery, but also in the extent
to which it thrusts the play’s
ideas about gender roles into
the limelight. The recasting
of Malvolio as Malvolia – a
woman played by a woman
– has a fitting parallel in
the times of Shakespeare,
in which men would have
played the female roles. This
is perhaps an attempt by
Godwin to show how society
has evolved: gender identity
is becoming more and
more distinct from sex, with
traditional male and female
societal expectations being
questioned and challenged.
Despite (and probably
partly because of) her solemn
and reserved appearance,
which brings to mind Mary
Barebone in the recent film
Fantastic Beasts and Where
to Find Them, Tamsin Greig
is able to put forward a per-
formance which is hilarious
in the subtlety of its humour.
The cold, disapproving stares
and dramatic, inappropriate
pauses, which are her forte,
are in stark contrast to her
puritan exterior: the very stuff
from which ironic comedy is
made. Certain moments of the
play, however – such as the
frankly outrageous costume
in which she greets Olivia, or
the sudden and exceedingly
dramatic change of character,
suggestive of her repressed
love – are probably unnec-
essarily over the top, given
Greig’s talent for being funny
without the need for such an
obvious display of ridicule.
Perhaps it was the twirling
tassels on her costume that
tipped the scales from hilarity
to downright disbelief.
But Shakespeare’s ‘come-
dies’ are not – in the sense
of the word – simply light-
hearted and humorous, as a
comedy of today might be;
despite the hilarious nature
of this play there is of course
the more sombre side that
accompanies Malvolia’s later
fate. Grieg’s portrayal of the
tragedy of a woman whose
love has been made into a
joke was raw in its emotion,
and heart-breaking to watch.
Again, this felt odd in contrast
with the incredulity of her
earlier flashy show.
Ideas about the roles of
gender run strong throughout
the performance: Feste is also
played by a woman – Doon
Mackichan – whose charac-
ter is playful, light-hearted,
and very entertaining,
certainly lightening the mood;
Tamara Lawrance’s Viola is
very boyish and believable,
quite adorably capturing
the humour of the dramatic
ironies of her situation. Her
antics with Olivia (Phoebe
Fox) whilst cross-dressing as
Cesario, are amusing, and
there are fitting touches of
modern humour added here
and there, such as a racy
scene in a Jacuzzi involving
a set of golden swimming
trunks. This would not be pos-
sible without a fully-fledged
water feature that the stage
Waleed El-Geresy
Twelfth Night is on at the
National Theatre until 13th
May
Tickets from £15
Twelfth Night – Tamsin Greig as Mal-
volia \\ Marc Brenner
is graced with, one which
also masquerades as an
ostensible, full-size fountain.
The presence of all this water
seems to simply beg for some-
body to get drenched. Suffice
to say we are not disap-
pointed on those grounds.
This audacious scenery is
testament to the brilliant show
put on – quite literally – by
the technical and lighting
team. They make full use of
the Olivier Theatre’s majestic
drum revolve, whose centre-
piece is a grand triangular
staircase: at one moment
stationary, and at the next
swivelling to create a sense of
simultaneity between several
different settings. Within
seconds, the set manages to
change from a ship crashing
into rocks in a storm, to the
more docile setting of Olivia’s
house, complete with modern
looking glass panels and men
in suits bright enough to throw
light on the future of fashion.
Not to be outmatched
by Orsino and his crew, a
very hipster Sir Toby Belch,
played by Tim McMullan, is
one of the highlights of this
performance. His authen-
tic performance as the
constantly drunk uncle was
so good that it made me feel
as though the bottles he was
incessantly swigging from
were perhaps slightly more
than simple props. Along with
the wing-man with a man-bun
Sir Andrew Aguecheek –
Daniel Rigby – the two are
the comedy relief duo of the
comedy itself, entertaining
us with their various antics to
pleasant tunes sung by Feste
and a small but skilled team
of live musicians – including
a saxophone player and gui-
tarist - adding a lot of aural
colour to the atmosphere.
For the most part, the
modern take on this play
does question ideas about
societal roles well. However,
attempts to put emphasis on
these ideas can sometimes
go a bit too far, notably in
a rather flamboyant scene
involving a drag queen
at a saucy bar called The
Elephant which seemed to be
in the production for the sole
purpose of making absolutely
certain we understood the
main theme. Simply shouting
Twelfth Night
| A contrast
between
subtlety and
aplomb
things louder can sometimes
produce an effect opposite
to that intended – some-
thing not exclusive to the
domain of theatre – and I
would say that the cleverest
moments of this production
were when humour and
ideas were put forward
less explicitly. On the other
hand, Twelfth Night is a
comedy whose very name
suggests it is meant to be
over the top and outra-
geous; Godwin, his cast,
and the production team
certainly managed to put
on a great performance,
leaving myself and most of
the audience in stitches.
