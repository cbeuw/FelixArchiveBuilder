Riverdale
Saad Ahmed
Y
ou can now add
Riverdale to
the increasing
list of media
adaptations of
various forms
of literature. Like most recent
adaptations, Riverdale also
goes for a darker and edgier
feel; however in this case,
this approach pulls off and
actually works spectacularly
well.
Riverdale is based upon the
Archie Comics, which was a
fun light-hearted series about
the general lives of different
teenagers in a small town
called Riverdale. The Archie
Comics are probably most
well known for their spin-offs,
Josie and the Pussycats and
Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
The stories told were fairly
colorful and comedic, making
up for their lack of depth with
an entertainment factor.
If you stop and think about
it, a completely faithful adap-
tation ran the risk of being
stale or uninspiring. Riverdale
takes the comic series and
characters and gives it its own
spin, which gives the show
an extra layer of complexity,
while still resembling the orig-
inal material enough to be
considered an adaptation.
The characters are written
way deeper than their one-di-
mensional portrayals in the
comics. At the centre of the
show is Archie Andrews, an
attractive red-haired student
(who we see shirtless a
number of times), who wants
to become a musician whilst
struggling to maintain an illicit
relationship with his music
teacher. Rather than being
portrayed as a clumsy, humor-
ous everyman, this version is
more driven, uncertain and
world-weary. Betty Cooper
is still the cute girl next door,
but one with an overbear-
ing mother and struggles
with perfectionism. She in
particular, plays off brilliantly
with Veronica Lodge, who’s
trying to move past the rich-
girl personality she’s known
for in the comics. Reggie
Mantle is still a tool, but hey,
there’s gotta be that one jock
who don’t care about.
The overarching story
revolves around the murder
of a student, Jason Blos-
soms and the circumstances
surrounding his death. This
plot point forms the glue of
the show, driving several
characters together and
putting them into contact, and
often conflict with each other.
We learn several secrets and
mysteries from practically all
the characters, and it is this
mystery that keeps us craving
the instalment so that we get
all the answers. Sometimes
things may happen just to
move the plot forward but it’s
only a minor point, and one
only notice if you really pay
attention.
An interesting little titbit is
how diverse the show is and
how it tries to reflect and
provide some commentary on
real life. We see a young gay
man, open up about himself
and his feelings; we see
Archie get called on for his
white privilege when he wants
to help the all-black Pussycats
band write some of their
songs. In one episode, there’s
a frank discussion on the
impact of slut-shaming as well
as how it may affect some of
the victims. What’s really nice
is that none of these moments
ever feel forced or present
just to fill a quota, but rather,
are naturally woven into the
Careful you don’t cut yourself on all that
edge \\ The CW
plot to subtly get the message
across. As a high-school
drama, it’s appreciated that
this series is more reflective of
current times and society.
At the end of the day,
most of the characters are
teenagers, so this is largely a
high-school drama. For some
people, that’s not really an
issue but if you’re the kind of
person who wanted to get
away from all that, this show
may not be for you. I’ve read
A kind of Dynamic Duo \\ The CW
somewhere online that this
show is described as “Twin
Peaks with attractive people”.
I can honestly say that is the
case; sure there’s the mystery
and intrigue, but there’s also
a fair amount of fan service.
In fact now that I think about
it, I’m sure practically every
relevant character is really
attractive in some shape or
form. I suppose you can’t
really get everything right
about high school.
Riverdale is a very much
‘CW’ take on the Archie
Comics; but it is one with
interesting mythos and strong
acting, with some shocking
story developments thrown
in here and there. While
seeing old characters with a
twist may be a bit jarring and
even though we’re a few epi-
sodes into the first season, it
definitely looks as though
viewers are in for a
wild and engaging
ride.
