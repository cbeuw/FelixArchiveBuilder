Robot | A
confusing
hodgepodge
of man and
machine
T
here is little doubt
that technology has
pervaded every
inch of our modern
lives. From people
plugged in on their
daily commutes, to the seas
of smartphones at concerts,
we seem to be constantly
immersed in gadgetry. But
is that a good or bad thing?
This question has become
something of a hot topic in
recent months, with shows
such as Westworld and Black
Mirror exploring the darker
consequences of a future
dominated by technology.
Choreographer Blanca
Li takes a more playful
approach with Robot, a
production filled with dancers
both human and humanoid.
It's an interesting premise.
Sure, robots can perform
calculations with superhu-
man speed and precision
– Google's AlphaGo AI
has even beaten us at Go
– but how will they fare
with something as uniquely
human as dancing? Surely
creative expression remains
very much our domain.
Unfortunately, Robot doesn't
deliver on its potential for an
interesting dialogue between
humans and robots; what-
ever message Li intended
to convey is lost some-
where between the strange
sequences, and the dance
pieces that went on for longer
than they should have.
In all fairness, the
eight human dancers
performed with
skill and ease;
their stamina
for carrying
such energetic
moves for
over an hour
was quite
commend-
able. But
despite the
energetic
choreogra-
phy, the moves
felt rather
monotonous and
repetitive – dare I
say, robotic?
Robot's selling point is its
generous use of actual robots.
The orchestra is self-playing,
composed of 10 mechanical
instruments by Japanese art
group Maywa Denki. The
musical prototypes are rather
whimsical: percussion instru-
ments dominate, although
there is a flower-shaped
marimba and an automated
concertina (which produced
a dreadful screeching note).
While the soundtrack, com-
posed by Tao Gutiérrez, was
quite enjoyable in parts, after
half an hour of drumbeats
and mechanical beeping
it started to become quite
headache-inducing.
The Nao robots were
definitely the selling point of
Robot. Infantile, with round
faces and LED eyes blinking

confusedly around, they
seemed designed to appeal
to our tendency to anthro-
pomorphosise electronic
devices. Nao #1 was gently
helped out of his box by one
of the dancers, like a parent
teaching a child his or her first
steps. They then performed a
short dance together, with the
dancer lifting the tiny robot
above his head in an amusing
pas de deux.
This was followed by a cho-
reographed routine carried
out entirely by seven Nao
models. Or rather, the Nao
robots made a brave attempt
at finishing their routine, only
to fall down every few moves
and struggle back to their
feet. This delighted the audi-
ence, with every new tumble
eliciting coos and ‘aahs’.
Was it intentional, or were
the Nao robots genuinely
incapable of keeping their
balance? If the former, cater-
ing to the audience’s desire
to see robots as harmless
and bumbling would have
been some clever lampshad-
ing by Li. However, I rather
suspect that it was down
to the limitations of current
robot-dancing technology
rather than any intention by
the choreographer.
As the production wore
on, it all struck me as a tad
juvenile – the cutely inept
Naos, the low-tech mechan-
ical orchestra, the human
dancers who seemed to
play second string to the
dancing robots. Finally,
the curtains closed
on a giant tangle of
machinery – var-
iously blinking,
beeping, and
bumping into
each other. A
stray Roomba
wandered
to the edge
of the stage,
and was left
outside when the
curtains closed.
By the end of the
performance, I felt
just as confused.
