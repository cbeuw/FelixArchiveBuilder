Imperial still
needs to divest
from fossil fuels
Alexandre Adler knows Imperial will
eventually divest, but will it be too late?
L
ast year, while
doing my Erasmus
at King’s College
London, I spotted a
small placard on the
wall calling on the
university to "divest" from
fossil fuels. By this, they meant
that the college should not
invest in corporations linked
to fossil fuel extraction and
exploitation. I am not a large
fan of endowment funds in
general and would really
like to see a greener world,
so the idea appealed to
me immediately. This year,
apparently, a few King’s
students took the campaign
a little further, and spray-
painted a few pillars on the
Strand building, an offence
for which they promptly got
arrested (anybody who has
seen that building’s façade
knows that the architect of
the Strand building is the
real culprit as far as urban
vandalism is concerned).
This year, I study at Imperial.
I am yet to see a poster calling
for the College to divest from
oil and gas. The fossil free cam-
paign has no committee listed
on the Union website, and
models of oil rigs proudly sit
in the Royal School of Mines.
Sustainability week came and

went, with little clamour. I guess
the only green that matters at
Imperial is the Queen’s Lawn.
The endowment fund’s repar-
tition is unfortunately not
publicly available informa-
tion, and students don’t have
access to the contact webpage
of the people responsible for
the fund. As a result, there
is no way of knowing what
amount Imperial has invested
in oil, coal and gas, although
an examination of its perfor-
mance suggests that much of
its portfolio is labelled in US
dollars, as the periods of best
performance roughly correlate
with slides in the £. Since we
do not know what is in Impe-
rial’s fund, we should assume
it is standard, and as such has
invested to some extent in oil
and gas companies.
However, the stated objec-
tives of the endowment fund
would make a good argument
for divestment themselves. The
stated aims of the fund are a
growth over five years of infla-
tion plus 4%, a lower than
average volatility in its invest-
ments. Why on God’s green
Earth would you choose the
energy sector as an investment
then? These companies’ for-
tunes are highly dependent
on the economic cycle, as oil

booms and busts closely follow
the patterns of global growth.
Now, if that was the only issue,
it would not make oil stand out
all this much; after all, most
companies suffer during a
recession. However, fossil fuels
are also a channel through
which countries leverage polit-
ical and diplomatic leverage.
The destinies of drillers depend
decisively on the dreams of
democrats and despots. For
instance, every tentative move
of Ukraine towards the EU
has resulted in Russia closing
the gas pipelines, forcing gas
providers on the continent to
shed extra money for alterna-
tive sources. The explosion of
Iraq inflated oil prices (twice),
as has the Iranian revolution.
On the other side, an attempt
by Saudi Arabia and Aramco
to drive out of business the
US fracking industry resulted
in a prolonged slump in oil
prices that brought numerous
exploration and equipment
companies to their knees.
Those are not long-term events
that are correlate to the wider
economy or to technological
advances. Those are shocks
that can reduce or inflate the
value of stocks significantly
within hours. As such, it makes
no sense for college to invest its
money in a sector so volatile,
since it states that it looks for
low volatility.
In the very long term, Impe-
rial will divest from oil, gas and
coal, as these energy sources
will lose relevance when
renewables become cheaper.
Climate change may cause
irreparable damages by then,
but it will happen eventually. It
is however crystal clear that as
long as the companies of the
sector have any influence, they
will try to slow the transition
towards a carbon neutral econ-
omy down, in the same way
they drove the fight against
recognizing global warming
for a quarter of a century. In
its research capacity, Imperial
does not want to associate with
those who purposefully slow
down progress and spit in the
face of inconvenient truths.
Why should it associate with
them financially?

We really need
to talk about
eating disorders
Emily-Jane Cramphorn talks about
the importance of eating disorder
awarenees and how conversation is the
only way to tackle the stigma
T
he past week
on campus has
been a busy one,
what with the
2017 leadership
elections, ‘show
season’ at the union concert
hall, and of course Varsity
goingon.Butthepastweekhas
also seen activists across the
nation trying to create change
for people who are impacted
by eating disorders. The final
week of February is Eating
Disorders Awareness Week
(EDAW) both in the UK and the
USA, and thus I have worked
hard to lead a supportive
campaign from ICU. Sadly, my
efforts have been somewhat
overshadowed by what can be
seen as more pressing issues
such as Elections and Varsity.
Whilst this is frustrating, I
can understand why EDAW
isn’t at the top of everyone’s
agenda: eating disorders
are a seemingly niche and
poorly understood topic and
might not take priority when
we are all under pressure to
meet deadlines and balance a
rudimentary social life. This in
itself is not necessarily a huge
problem but it is indicative
of the wider problem of
how eating disorders are
perceived, discussed and
treated in society. We don’t
have to talk about eating
disorders for only one week
of the year. I, and others who
are trying to foster change,
am willing to talk about eating
disorders all year long. The
problem is, other people aren’t
necessarily as keen because
eating disorders aren’t
seen as hugely important.
Eating disorders are a huge,
complex and somewhat
terrifying subject and as such
people tend to shy away from
the conversation. Talking
about eating disorders is one
of those things that you keep
putting to the side because
you want to do it right but
you’re not quite sure how to
go about it. Then of course
\\ You never know when
your life might be derailed
by an eating disorder \\
there are the people who
simply think eating disorders
aren’t a real problem and
that those suffering are just
narcissistic teenage girls who
want to look like Kate or
Cara. The reality is that by
not engaging in conversation
about eating disorders – and
I don’t mean spreading gossip
about celebrity weight – we
are doing more harm than by
saying the wrong thing. By
talking about eating disorders
with those whose lives have
been touched by them we
learn about the dos and don’ts
for conversations in the future.
But more importantly we
continue to chip away at the
stigma and misconceptions,
starting with openly discussing
eating disorders. Quite
frankly, eating disorders are
everybody’sproblembecause,
as a previous B-eat slogan
emphasises, “everybody
knows somebody”. Eating
disorders affect at least 10%
of our population without
taking into account those
who are undiagnosed and
the loved ones of sufferers.
People should take an interest
in eating disorders, not just
because of people like me
shouting about it, but because
you never know when your life
might be derailed by one.
Eating disorders count some
of the deadliest mental illnesses
amongst their ranks. Despite
20% of anorexics dying as a
result of their condition, the
media still celebrate thinness,
self-deprivation and obsessive
relationships with food. The
same culture, and a wave of
skinny-shaming culture born
out of it, trivialises eating dis-
orders as something sufferers
choose and can simply give
up at will. Megan Trainor,
for example, who’s been her-
alded as a body positive role
model, told reporters that she
“tried being anorexic for an
hour” and then got her mum
to make her a sandwich, show-
ing her gross misunderstanding
of what anorexia is. Yet this
message has been perpetu-
ated and celebrated by those
trying to fight back against
\\ Sadly, my efforts
have been some-
what overshadowed
by what can be seen
as more pressing
issues \\
diet culture. Anorexia is not
a choice; one does not simply
try being anorexic and eat a
sandwich when it’s too difficult.
Anorexia is a deadly and life
wrecking mental illness that
has claimed too many wonder-
ful people from this earth.
Another myth perpetuated by
the media is that people with
eating disorders are skinny.
Whilst that is the case for
some, the majority of people
with an eating disorder are
not underweight. Anorexia is
one of the least common eating
disorders yet is what we gen-
erally think of when discussing
eating disorders. Thousands
of people suffer in isolation
through fear of being ridiculed
or disbelieved if they talk about
their eating disorders, simply
because they are not under-
weight. And for those who
are underweight, there is a
fear of not being underweight
enough, perpetuated by com-
ments like “but you don’t look
anorexic” and the rationing
of treatments based on body
mass index. The only way
to change this rhetoric is to
challenge it through conversa-
tion and education, hence the
importance of eating disorders
awareness week.
This year’s EDAW theme
focuses on early intervention,
which is shown to improve
prognosis for those with
eating disorders, and aims to
incite change in the treatment
of eating disorders by remov-
ing BMI barriers and allowing
sufferers to access treatments
regardless of weight. Remov-
ing low-BMI requirements
from treatment is extremely

important in helping people
recover faster and fuller, but
it has the power to change
so much more than that by

learning a little more or starting
a conversation about eating
disorders over the coming
weeks. Oh! and if you haven’t
already done so, please check
