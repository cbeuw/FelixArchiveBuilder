L
ast weekend, from
Friday to Sunday
evening, IC Jiu
Jitsu took part in a
national competition
in Northampton,
and brought back SEVEN
MEDALS. This competition,
contrary to the competition
happening in November,
is not called “atemis” but
“randoris”. Randori is a type
of practice that you can also
encounter in judo, it is a way
of applying and practicing
your knowledge freely,
playing around with the
techniques you’ve gathered
so far.
The weekend was divided
as follows: training Saturday
morning and, for those who
can practice with a hangover,
Sunday morning; qualification
fights on Saturday afternoon
and finals Sunday afternoon.
And it wouldn’t be a proper
competition weekend without
a party on Saturday!!! The
dress code of the party was
smart casual, meaning you
would see all participants you
had just fought out of their
sweaty “gi” (the traditional
outfit that looks like white
pyjamas) and all groomed
up, but with still a few leftover
bruises and scratches …
The morning training
starts with a warm up, and
participants are then divided
by grade. Each grade will
get to train with up to three
instructors, practicing tech-
niques needed for their next
grade or perfecting one they
already knew. After this all
grades are mixed and train
together, also with different
instructors who can pick out
a particular technique they
would like to teach. After a
small lunch break the competi-
tion starts.
In this type of competition,
participants are divided
between male and female,
by grade, and by weight
class. The higher your grade,
the more techniques (locks,
chokes, strangles…fun times)
you are allowed to use. For
the referees to not get con-
fused between participants
in a fight, opponents have
to wear belts of different
colours, for us it was red
and white. Penalties can be
attributed if a participant
does not respect the rules of
the competition, or if they try
to apply a technique that is
not allowed for their grade. A
participant can be declared
forfeit if they pass out on
the mat (meaning that they
usually did not tap out from a
hold when they should have),
or cannot stop a bleeding
(doesn’t matter how small) in
a reasonable time.
All grades have to go
through a “ne waza” competi-
tion, which is all groundwork:
competitors start sitting down,
back to back, and after the
start is given they can win
the round by pinning their
opponent to the ground for
20 seconds, put them in a
lock and make them tap out,
or if they don’t manage to
get a clear win the referees
will decide who won the fight
depending on technique and
initiative demonstrated.
Grades green and above
also have to go through a
standing, or “tachi waza”,
competition consisting of
trying to throw your opponent
as they are resisting you.
Competitors start standing,
face to face, and try to throw
each other to the ground.
Points are given for each
throw relative to the control
getting off of it after the fight,
bow to the referee and then
to each other. This essentially
mean that the competitors
respect and entrust them-
selves to each other, and if
anybody gets hurt there will
be no bad feelings about it.
During the fights the edges
of the mat area are crowded
with people cheering for the
competitors, and trying to
shout out relevant advice.
Even though it can put some
pressure on you, having your
club and other jitsu friends
cheering for you does give
you more confidence and
pushes you to go all out
even more to win the fight.
The fights do not last more
than a few minutes, but they
are extremely tiring. Being
against somebody of the
same build as you usually
means that they will have the
same type of fighting prefer-
ences, making it really tough
to do anything as you are
both trying to do the same
thing.
RESULTS:
Yellows men: silver and 4th
in
ground
Orange women: bronze in
ground
Green women: gold in
ground and standing
Purple Women: 4th
in
ground, silver in standing
Purple men: silver in ground
and standing
demonstrated while executing
the technique. There is a point
limit as well as a time limit for
those fights.
Even though we are all
trying to beat the lights out of
each other, respect between
competitors is omnipres-
ent, and opponents usually
become really good friends.
You can see most fights
ending up with a smile and an
exhausted hug or a respectful
handshake. Respect is a big
part of Jiu Jitsu: competitors
bow (“rei”) before getting
on the mat to fight and when
\\ The higher the
grade, the more
techniques (locks,
chocks, strangles ...
fun times) you are
allowed to use \\
