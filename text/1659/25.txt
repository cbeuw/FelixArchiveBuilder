aturday was
the most
anticipated day
of the underwater
hockey calendar:
the national
tournament. Hosted by a
different university each year
and run with the assistance
of our governing body (the
British Octopush Association),
the student nationals see
the best underwater hockey
teams from around the
country battle head to head
to secure the title of national
champions. With Plymouth A
team wearing t-shirts boasting
of their six consecutive wins,
the pressure was on.
As a fast growing sport here
at Imperial, our team was
novice heavy. This meant
the tournament saw several
debutants during official
matches, which vary from
games we play during train-
ing with three referees for
every game: two water refs
and one land ref, watching
from above the water. Every
player’s moves are under
scrutiny, trying to withhold
the non-contact aspects of
play, although after a fin or
two to the face you will soon
realise this is not a sport for
the delicate. Despite the refs
communicating by signs indi-
cating rules akin to football,
even including the off-side
rule, the pool was anything
but quiet. As a 50 metre com-
petition pool it was split into
four areas: three games were
played simultaneously, each
with their own set of splashes
and cheers over goals, and
the warm-up area had its
own intense atmosphere as
captains tried to coach their
last few tactics between
games. This allowed for
just under 100 games to be
played throughout the day,
with our team competing in
an exhausting ten of them.
As none of us had ever
competed at this level
before, we started with low
expectations. We were very
much there to learn from the
other teams and soak up
some experience, but were
pleased to hold up a fair
game against several teams.
Playing against some GB
players, every single goal
was a great achievement.
Drawing in our final game,
we finished the tournament in
high-spirits, with high hopes
for next year as we continue
to improve, having come on

in a 6-2 tie. Due to having the
undoubtedly best scores, both
on offense and defense, the
tie was broken in our favour,
handing us the 1A South East
conference title along with
a 3rd
seed in the play-offs, a
home game at #FortHarling-
ton and a hangover to start
the week.

A
fter a season-
long fight,
it all boiled
down to the
last Sunday
of the regular
season. To be or not to be,
it’s now or never: all three
play-off qualifiers (Imperial
Immortals, Cambridge
Pythons and Kent Falcons)
could come out top of the
division if the day went their
way.
While our play-off rivals
had a game between them,
we travelled to Royal Hollo-
way to face their Bears. The
coming spring had brought
an end to their hibernation,
and the 0-7 team were giving
tough resistance to teams that
used to walk over them just
before the Christmas break.
We had to fight to not hand
them their first win of the
season.
And fight we did. After a
short offensive drive and a
punt on the Royal Holloway
part, the ball was handed to
Immortals offense. Having
found their footing in the
previous 46-0 victory against
the then-reigning Pythons,
the offense gained five to
ten yards per carry faster
than the Bears could blink.
In no time at all the ball
ended up in the notoriously
grabby hands of Josemi
(is it pronounced Hosemi?
Yosemi? You choose!) in RHUL
endzone after a gorgeous
30-yard pass. 6-0.
Immortals defense proved
why they’re the best in the
league and forced a three-
and-out, officially giving
RHUL offense less action than
you can get at an average
sports night. Ball returned
to Immortals offense, which
slowly but surely moved
forwards until the very begin-
ning of the second quarter
when Jason made me recycle
his old “Kill’em” nickname
by doing exactly what it says
on the tin. After waiting for
an appropriately-equipped
ambulance due to a sus-
pected neck injury on RHUL
side, the game was called
6-0 to us. Thankfully, Will the
Bear does not seem to have
suffered any lasting injury,
and we sincerely wish him a
speedy recovery.
After this rather sombre
win, we tuned into Kent-Cam-
bridge to witness a Falcons
victory, meaning all three of
top division teams ended up
leaps and bounds since our
first tournament last term
and continuously recruiting
new players to our Thursday
evening training sessions at
ETHOS (8pm-10pm).
Last but not least, we were
rewarded with an after-party
in the evening, an opportunity
to let our hair down out of our
ridiculous-looking hats and
get to know the other teams.
We quickly became close to
Oxford, who we had played
a friendly against only a few
days before. Smashing this
friendly had really boosted
our team morale.

T
he membership
base of the
Imperial College
Yacht Club had
shrunk over the
past five years
and the new committee of
the yacht club are eager to
find solutions to improve this
situation as well as the club’s
operations.
After a summer-long dis-
cussion within the yacht club,
potential areas of develop-
ment were identified, such as
participating in regattas over-
seas and introducing yachting
courses to Imperial students.
Unfortunately, as soon as the
academic year began, the
yacht club started to focus on
its existing yachting activities.
Those seemingly ambitious
plans were suspended due to
lack of capacity.
An occasional opportunity
put the yacht club in contact
with the Imperial Consulting
Group (ICG), an organisation
run by Imperial students. The
yacht club then engaged ICG
in the hopes of delivering
systematic strategies to offer
better services to its members.
The collaboration process
started with a kickstart
meeting between yacht club
committee and ICG consult-
ants. During the meeting, the
yacht club’s operations were
presented to ICG to better
understand the existing issues
and objectives.
Since then, the consultants
have worked on the project
collaboratively and updated
the yacht club committee
through frequent discussions.
The ICG consultants have also
received training and mentor-
ship from L.E.K. Consulting, a
leading global strategy con-
sulting firm. Despite startimg
with modest consulting back-
grounds, the ICG consultants
quickly picked up the skill set
along the project.
During the project, ICG
first conducted the feasibility
study of delivering the Royal
Yachting Association (RYA)
yachting courses to Imperial
students. Offering yachting
courses is an important part
of the development strategy
as it adds a new source of
income to the club. ICG then
proposed a roadmap of intro-
ducing the RYA course based
on different costs and human
resources options. According
to the plan, by delivering the
courses the yacht club itself
will become an RYA-certified
training centre, able to con-
duct yacht trainings globally.
The consultants then focused
on membership study and
branding analysis for the
yacht club. Consultants com-
pared the yacht club against
other sports clubs at Imperial
and other UK universities in
order to understand the rela-
tive position of the yacht club.
An indicative survey, which
received over 110 responds,
revealed the yacht club’s
public perception in areas
such as the quality of activ-
ities, membership cost, trip
prices, social media commu-
nications, and etc. Although
seen as an expensive sport,
many students are interested
in yachting and are willing to
give it a try.
In order to understand how
yacht clubs are operated
in other top universities,
the yacht club arranged an
interview for ICG with Dr Paul
Wedrich, the former vice-com-
modore of Cambridge
University Yacht Club. During
the meeting Dr Wedrich
talked about the history of the
Cambridge University Yacht
Club, and how the club devel-
oped, step by step, towards
owning two yachts, and gen-
erating an annual turnover
over £100,000. The interview
was obviously inspiring, but
also implied the importance
of development strategy for
a student club. Nevertheless,
the interview seeded the
goodwill of yachting collabo-
rations in the future between
Cambridge and Imperial.
Lastly, ICG developed a
five-year growth strategy for
the yacht club based on the
insights from the investigations
and analysis. After approx-
imately ten weeks, the final
deliverables of the consulting
project were organised and
formally presented to the
yacht club’s committee. Some
of the highlights of the five-
year growth strategy include
the offering of yachting day
trips, more competitive mem-
bership fee and reasonable
pricings.
Yacht club’s president was
thrilled with the results and
described it as “a wonderful
success” and that it “shines a
light on the yacht club’s future
development”. After the
successful presentation, con-
sultants from the project were
offered committee positions
within the yacht club. In the
yacht club’s general opinion,
they are the right talents to
lead the implementation of
the study results. One con-
sultant has already accepted
the offer, and commented
that “it will be an entirely
new experience to join the
client side, but we will learn
to adapt and create values
where possible.”
The yacht club has already
started implementing the
strategies. Their racing
team, Team Imperial, is
participating in the world’s
biggest student regatta in
France this April. Also, an
initial collaboration with the
Cambridge University Yacht
Club is likely to launch next
academic year, focusing on
yachting trainings. Mean-
while, ICG has started its
second-round spring projects.
ICG is actively seeking
consulting projects from
societies within the Imperial
Union, hoping to provide aid
to any issues ranging from
long term growth plans to
feasibility studies, offering
value through students with
varied backgrounds and
perspectives.
