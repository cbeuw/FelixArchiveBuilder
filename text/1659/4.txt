which allows our exchange
students to join clubs and
participate in Union events
and activities.
This remains an assumption
though as the only way
to find out is by looking
through the Board of Trustees
minutes (warning: they are
not particularly detailed),
which state the Associate
Membership Policy as an item
discussed, but don’t make
clear whether the policy was
passed or whether it’s still in
review (though after pestering
the Union President we were
informed that it was passed).
Others still may have
been passed at Council. It is
typical for Union policies to
be reviewed en mass at the
end of the year, felix was told
by a Union official. A look
at the last Council meeting
for the year 2015/16 for
example, shows that eight
policies were discussed. These
include the Unpaid Internships
Policy, which condemns the
exploitation of students by
companies which have the
means to pay for labour,
the Tankards Policy, which
outlines the management
of one of Europe’s largest
tankard collections (hosted
in the Union Bar) including
new tankard specs, and the
Environmental Policy which
presents guidelines on waste
reduction, water use, carbon
emissions, energy and
transport.
Again it is unclear whether
these policies were passed or
amended in any way as the
minutes currently available
aren’t particularly detailed or
helpful.
At the same time there
doesn’t seem to be a trace
of the review progress of
other policies. Including the
Transport Policy and the
Drinks Service Policy. Have
these policies expired and if
so what does that mean?
We asked Stephen Naulls, a

he Union has fallen
behind maintaining
up to date policies
responsible for
managing a range
of issues, from
Equality of Opportunities
to Club Society and Project
(CSP) Equipment.
A felix investigation found
that according to the Union
website, out of the Union’s
70 policies, 36 are currently
marked as expired. Though
some of the expired policies
have become redundant, such
as CSP Budgeting Policy 15-16
which has been replaced with
Budgeting Policy 2016/17,
others remain essential
for managing the Union’s
operations, such as the Tours
Policy, which describes how
tours are defined and should
be taken into consideration
when budgets are allocated
towards tours.
Others protect the Union
from legal risk, such as the also
lapsed Freedom of Speech
and Events Approval Policy
which is meant to be adhered
to by all students organising
events on and off campus.
The policy ensures that
checks are made on external
speakers and that events
comply to the Union’s Equality
of Opportunities Policy
(which has also expired), so
as to minimise risks such as
conducting unlawful political
activity, breaching public
benefit principles or even
putting the safety of attendees
at risk.
One Union source said “It
defines our interactions with
external speakers. We have
to have one as part of Prevent
and puts us at terrible risk.”
Although we were informed
by Union President, Nas
Andriopoulos, that this
particular policy should
actually still be in accordance
with the bye-laws and
constitution which say policy
exists for three years since
ratification, and as it was
passed in June 2015, it should
be live until June 2018. “I do
believe the webpage showing
the lapsed date of July 2016 is
erroneous.” At the same time it
is stated in the policy that the
policy needs to be reviewed
annually (to ensure that it’s
uptodate with Prevent updates
presumably). Confused? So
are we.
Furthermore, some policies
seem to have been renewed
by the Board of Trustees but
have not been updated on the
Union’s website, such as the
Associate Membership Policy,
veteran Council member, now
alumnus and honorary life
member of the Union who said
that “It is perfectly reasonable
to assert that “lapse” (as
used in Bye Law C) means
that the policy no longer has
any standing and thus there
is no need to even entertain
any reference to the lapsed
policy. Thus there is space for
individuals to make executive
decisions.”
But the real issue is the lack
of transparency and even
knowledge as to the Union’s
resolutions. With the annual
brain drain which follows
the succession of sabbatical
officers, it is easy to lose track
of what needs doing within the
organisation.
Sure, maybe the Transport
Policy has expired and you can
now use the Union minibuses
for your IKEA trip, or maybe
the Drinks Service Policy has
lapsed and you’re now able to
order triple shots, quadruple
shots and really any multiple

you want mixed into anything
else you want, including spirits
into draughts (though there
are undeniably many more
serious side effects to the lack
of an updated Drinks Service
policy, and god knows the
legal risk the Union is putting
itself in).
But the fact that no one really
knows is the real issue.
“This is a recurring problem”
says Stephen Ball, an alumnus
and honorary life member of
the Union. “The issue is that
when there is no official policy
there is nothing to direct staff,
sabbs or students in their
decisions. This can allow
individuals to make unilateral
decisions without consultation
or making inconsistent
decisions without a good
basis e.g. the order minibuses
are rented out – which club
gets priority. This opens the
door to the possibility of
challenges, of discrimination
or bias. But it also puts sabbs,
staff and student volunteers in
challenging situations as they
have to make judgement calls.
“[This] is a longstanding issue
and is reflective of the seeming
lack of concern being given
to the Union’s democratic
structures as also reflected in
the issues with minutes and
papers being released.”
The current managing
director Jarlath O’Hara and
the Union President have
made promises to review the
procedure at the end of the
year.
of demand through huge
infrastructure developments,
the only solution for people
on low incomes is to seek
social housing – the only
option left available at a
reasonable price. But with
1.8 million people currently
on the waiting lists for social
housing, and local authorities
allocating it with a needs-
based approach, students are
very rarely included in such
schemes. This leaves only the
private sector.
But for students in particular,
the private rented sector can
present unique challenges and
be daunting in its complexity.
The astronomical fees that
letting agents charge, frankly
odious conditions some
landlords expect you to live in
purely on account of being a
student, and trouble of finding
a guarantor for your tenancy
agreement can all burden
people with unnecessary
levels of stress as they house-
hunt. In London especially,
where the costs are so inflated
and continue to soar even
now, it feels increasingly like
we have no control or voice.
Schemes such as Share and
Care and Homeshare UK have
popped up in recent years
– their aim being to match
people looking for affordable
accommodation with elderly
people in need of support and
company. Increasing numbers
of students are turning to
them as a solution to see them
through their studies.

Can students bear London’s housig crisis?
Stephen Naulls takes you through recent political developments aiming at tackliong the country’s
housing crisis while discussing how students are affeted and what they can expect.
It’s that time of year again.
The ‘Private Housing Event’
invitation has appeared on
Facebook, your housemates
are suspiciously quiet about
that looming deadline to
renew your tenancy, and the
thought of going through the
whole process again makes
you even more nauseous than
that seventh snakebite you
had at Reynolds the previous
evening.
As the number of outright
home owners in the U.K. has
fallen drastically, along with a
moderate decline in the social
rented sector, the number
of people relying on private
renting has risen sharply.
There are now more
than nine million people
living in private rented
accommodation in England. It
is neither particularly secure,
nor financially sensible, and
often compared to effectively
burning money. Recently,
the number of homeless
households in the U.K. has
risen to more than 50,000;
all of this serves as a damning
indictment of the sheer lack
of capacity in the housing
system. We desperately need
a long-term solution.
So what is the long-term
solution? Somebody with
the most basic grasp of
economics will tell you that
there is a failure of the
balance between supply and
demand in the U.K. housing
market. The position of the
two main political parties, the
Conservatives and Labour, is
to build 200,000 more homes
by 2020, but this is juxtaposed
with a report published by the
House of Lords, citing a need
for 300,000 new homes to
be built in this Parliament. No
government has built enough
homes for decades now.

them from having to pay
three to six months of rent in
advance. Last year, a large
group of Imperial students
attended a massive event as
part of the London Mayoral
Election in association with
CitizensUK to quiz candidates
on their pledges for students
going forward.
One of the key pledges
coming out of the CitizensUK
event was Sadiq Khan’s focus
on affordable housing for
Londoners. Over the next four
and a half years £3.15 billion
will be invested in building

draft Supplementary Planning
Guidance aims to streamline
the planning process for new
housing projects. All of this
is long overdue to deal with
the problems Londoners face,
and more needs to be done
to ensure students are able
to claim their fair share of the
new homes.
The housing crisis is a
deeply-rooted issue in our
society – the result of decades
of under-investment in new
developments. Students
have been forced to burden
an unfair share of the
consequences that stem from
this. But hope may be on the
horizon, with our new Mayor
pledging to deliver genuinely
affordable homes for all
Londoners. I can only hope all
students are included in that
too.
