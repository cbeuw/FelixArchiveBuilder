re current
politics getting
you down?
Worried that
the world is
heading in the
wrong direction? Worry not –
habitable, pristine, Trumpless,
planets are coming soon to
galaxies near you (perhaps).
Indeed, a newly-discovered
solar system just 39 light
years from Earth contains
planets that are possibly
warm enough to sustain water
and life.
These have been found
around a small star in the
constellation of Aquarius,
Trappist-1, presenting the first
time in history that so many
Earth-sized planets have been
found in orbit around the
same star. This star has the
characteristic of being small
and cold, hence allowing the
seven closely-packed planets
that orbit around it to have
remarkably moderate temper-
atures. Their sizes vary from
25% smaller to 10% larger
than the Earth.
This discovery, completely
unexpected, has thrilled
many, as it has raised hopes
that the hunt for alien life
beyond the solar system
F
act: humans are 90%
stardust.
Human beings are
mostly made up of
water, with a few
other bits and pieces
thrown in for good measure.
That means we are largely
made of Hydrogen atoms,
followed by lots of Oxygen, a
fair bit of Carbon, some Nitro-
gen and a sprinkling of some
more interesting stuff.
Immediately after the big
bang, the only elements
that existed were Hydrogen
and Helium: everything else
was formed over billions of
years as a product of fusion
reactions (when two atoms
fuse together to make a
single heavier atom). These
fusion reactions take place
in stars, producing heavier
elements such as Oxygen,
Nitrogen and Carbon, as well
as recycling lots of Hydro-
gen. The really heavy atoms
– think Gold and Silver –
require something a bit more
dramatic, and are made only
during the massive energy
release of supernovas.
So all those familiar
elements – Calcium in your
bones and Iron in your blood
– are just bits of leftover
stardust made in great balls
of fire billions of years ago.
It’s enough to make you feel
just a little bit special.

could start much sooner than
anticipated. Ignas Snellen, an
astrophysicist at the Leiden
Observatory in the Neth-
erlands said “This is really
something new. When they
started this search several
years ago, I really thought
it was a waste of time. I was
very, very wrong”.
Astronomers are now focus-
ing on using current space
technology, including the
Hubble and NASA’s James
Webb Space Telescope to
determine whether the planets
have atmospheres and they
hope to know whether there
is life on the planets within the
next decade, when the next
generation of telescopes will
be fully developed. Exciting
times in the astronomical
world.

Lizzie Riach discusses plans to create a full genetic map of all life on Earth

O
n the 23rd
of
February,
a small
group of
researchers
announced
they wanted to sequence “all
life on Earth” at a meeting
organised by the Smithsonian
Initiative of Biodiversity
Genomics and China-based
sequencing powerhouse
BGI. The plan has been aptly
named the Earth BioGenome
Project (EBP), and would
firstly focus on sequencing
the DNA of the eukaryotes
– the group of organisms
that includes plants, animals,
fungi and single-celled
microorganisms like amoebas.
The response to the plan
was well received, however
the financial cost will be
several billion dollars, and
so may take time to kick off.
Oliver Ryder, a conservation
biologist for the San Diego
Zoo Institute says “This is
a grand idea – if we really
want to understand how life
evolved, genome biology will
be a part of that”.
So why should all life be
sequenced? The research-
ers involved drew several
parallels between this and
the Human Genome project,
which resulted in many new
DNA technologies that form
the backbone of many new
medical treatments. Harry
Lewin, one of the EBP vision-
aries and an evolutionary
genomicist at the University
of California points out
that “people have learned
from the human genome
experience that [sequencing]
is a tremendous advance in
biology”.
Despite being a long way
off a concrete plan, the
estimated costs are already
being worked out, with the
entire eukaryotic sequence
costing around the same as it
did to sequence the very first
human genome (according
to Lewin). In today’s money,
this is around $4.8 billion,
and could take as little time
as a decade according to the
organisers.
This seems like a big job,
but a lot of headway has
already been made, with lots
of smaller projects already
having sequenced large
numbers of genomes. These
include the Genome 10K
Project, that aims to sequence
10,000 vertebrate genomes
(one from each genus);
i5K, deciphering 5000
arthropods; and B10K, which
is looking at 10,500 bird
species genomes. EBP would
simply coordinate, compile
and fund these various teams.
The biggest challenge may,
however, be getting the DNA
itself. Museum specimens,
as well as recently collected
frozen samples may not
yield enough, so many
may have to be retrieved
from the wild. If completed,
this project could provide
valuable insights into our
evolution and own genomic
make up. Lewin maintains
that this is the natural course
of genomics, as sequencing
improves with time, saying “It
became apparent to me that
at a certain point, it would be
possible to sequence all life
on Earth.”
