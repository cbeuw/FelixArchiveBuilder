The landscape of higher education
is changing and there are challenges
ahead. I have the experience to lead the
Union through this change and ensure
the best outcomes for all. I currently
represent 2000 of you in all aspects of
your university life in my role as ICSMSU
President. Previously I was ICSM Clubs
& Societies Officer and ICSM Treasurer
and I have held 16 committee positions
across 6 different societies. During my 5
years at Imperial it has been amazing
to have met, supported and worked
with so many people. I want to use
this experience to improve the student
experience at Imperial. This year I have
been part of a strong team of ICU
sabbatical officers and have first-hand
knowledge of the great activities and
support the Union offers. I will continue
to promote all this. I also want to
work towards long term development.
Building on the work of this year’s team
we can make lasting change to benefit
you and students to come.
Specific things I would work to achieve
include: Shuttle service to Heston/
Harlington on Wednesdays; Counselling
triage appointments within 10 college
Alex Chippy Compton days; Study skills advice for first years;
Support for Constituent Unions
and Management Groups; Staff and
sabbatical officer presence at non-SK
campuses; Advancing the current work
on protected Wednesday afternoons
for PG students; Focusing the ongoing
programme to increase external
revenue sources to give better value for
money.
Trust Experience Trust Chippy.

Candidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
Imperial College Union is proud to host
over 350 clubs and societies, all run by
an incredibly valuable volunteer base
- our students - willing to commit so
much to ensure their success.
I want not only to represent all of
these volunteers, but to also make
improvements so that everyone can
enjoy their clubs and societies as much
as I have. In my five years at Imperial
I have gained experience as a club
member, as a club treasurer and in a
organisation and development role as
Management Group Chair for ICSM.
My experience has given me valuable
insight into areas where we do really
well and three main areas which I
would like to develop (and form a
convenient acronym):
Training- You say you have felt under-
prepared for your volunteer roles, so I
will ensure that appropriate training is
tailored for all students, allowing you to
feel confident in your roles.
Openness-You sometimes feel that the
Union, College and Sport Imperial are
Thomas Bacarese-
Hamilton
too opaque. I will ensure that all relevant
information is released in a way which
you are able to understand.
Management- You have long
complained about minibuses, storage
and room bookings. I will review how
we manage club amenities to ensure
that you are able to get the maximum
available.

“If loving Imperial College’s clubs and
societies was a crime, by all means lock
me up”
– James Snakey every Wednesday.
Alright fellas and fellarinas, my name is
James and I am an anticipating Biology
graduate, a 3-year veteran/committee
member of ICHC and just a stand-
up guy looking to contribute. A more
extra-curricular approach to university
life cannot be stressed enough, even
at an academia focused institution like
Imperial as it will grant a more rounded
and meaningful student experience.
I have a dream of an Imperial where
students strive to strike a perfect
balance between academia and often
forgotten extra-curriculars. I shall
achieve my vision by being voted as
the people’s representative in order
to synergistically forge the bridges
between the clubs and societies and
the Imperial College Union. I might not
be the most experienced but I more
than make up for that in passion and
creativity. Furthermore, if you believe
in honesty and transparency, I strictly
suggest you give consider me for vote
as I’m a straight shooter and what you
James Breakey see is what you get.
Policies include: Working alongside
DPFS on delivering clearer policies on
how funding pots (tour funding, ADF,
BUCS) are allocated. Granting the Union
responsibility to handle their own
general club issues independently whilst
Sport Imperial only handle bookings/
fixtures. Allowing management groups
chairs to sit on more sport boards for
better student representation. Campus
drinks prices match local competition
(e.g. The Slug). Finding better storage
facilities. Imperial sports teams must
have a snake-based mascot.

Hi, I’m Mo, a fourth year student
currently completing my masters in
chemical engineering. My Imperial
experience however extends beyond
CGCU. Through my interactions with
students from different departments, I
have developed a deep understanding
of the issues faced by the wider student
body.
Despite having headed societal
campaigns with teams of over a
hundred fellow students, I still come up
against the academic shortcomings of
Imperial daily. For this reason, I am close
enough to the issues at hand that I can
present your concerns accurately and
from your perspective. With this intuitive
understanding, and by unlimited
accessibility to you, I am confident we
can tackle the following issues:
Feedback: The unacceptable
inconsistency with feedback times
for projects and courseworks needs
to be addressed. I will work tirelessly
to introduce stringent operating
procedures, lowering these waiting
times across all departments.

responsibility, including as the ACC
Management Group Vice-Chair. Having
studied good financial practice in the
Business School, I will make sure the

Qasim Mahmood
I’m Qasim, a fourth-year Aerospace
Materials student. Over the past four
years I’ve been at Imperial, I’ve written
many high-quality articles for Felix,
ranging from science to technology
and gaming. Being deeply involved with
the newspaper as a content provider,
I have a very different outlook on how
Felix should operate than those who’ve
worked as section editors.
The lack of diversity is still an issue, and
there needs to be a drive to encourage
a wider array of students to contribute.
a wider array of students to contribute.
However, the biggest issue facing the
newspaper is its lack of digital presence;
the infrequency of Facebook posts and
the lack of any web-only content is
holding the paper back significantly, and
this sorely needs to be rectified.
This is exactly what I aim to improve,
by holding more open, well-publicised
events to tackle general tips for writing
articles, aimed towards giving people
more confidence to contribute. I will
massively increasing Felix’s social media
presence, by posting articles as soon
as they are done, posting small, web-
as they are done, posting small, web-
only articles and videos on the more
interesting content, such as interviews
with the authors or more in-depth
discussions on a topic. Having been
Publicity Head of Charity Week, I have
ample experience with publicising
events, which I can use to promote
Felix. I also aim to give societies allotted
times to contribute articles to promote
upcoming events and discuss relevant
content. This, along with inter-uni
articles and contributors will significantly
boost readership and make Felix a paper
to be proud of.

the infrequency of Facebook posts and
the lack of any web-only content is
holding the paper back significantly, and
this sorely needs to be rectified.
This is exactly what I aim to improve,
by holding more open, well-publicised
events to tackle general tips for writing
articles, aimed towards giving people
more confidence to contribute. I will

interesting content, such as interviews
with the authors or more in-depth
discussions on a topic. Having been
Publicity Head of Charity Week, I have
ample experience with publicising
events, which I can use to promote
Felix. I also aim to give societies allotted
times to contribute articles to promote
upcoming events and discuss relevant
content. This, along with inter-uni
articles and contributors will significantly
boost readership and make Felix a paper
to be proud of.

Candidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
Imperial College Union is proud to host
over 350 clubs and societies, all run by
an incredibly valuable volunteer base
- our students - willing to commit so
much to ensure their success.
I want not only to represent all of
these volunteers, but to also make
improvements so that everyone can
enjoy their clubs and societies as much
as I have. In my five years at Imperial
I have gained experience as a club
member, as a club treasurer and in a
organisation and development role as
Management Group Chair for ICSM.
My experience has given me valuable
insight into areas where we do really
well and three main areas which I
would like to develop (and form a
convenient acronym):
Training- You say you have felt under-
prepared for your volunteer roles, so I
will ensure that appropriate training is
tailored for all students, allowing you to
feel confident in your roles.
Openness-You sometimes feel that the
Union, College and Sport Imperial are
Thomas Bacarese-
Hamilton
too opaque. I will ensure that all relevant
information is released in a way which
you are able to understand.
Management- You have long
complained about minibuses, storage
and room bookings. I will review how
we manage club amenities to ensure
that you are able to get the maximum
available.

“If loving Imperial College’s clubs and
societies was a crime, by all means lock
me up”
– James Snakey every Wednesday.
Alright fellas and fellarinas, my name is
James and I am an anticipating Biology
graduate, a 3-year veteran/committee
member of ICHC and just a stand-
up guy looking to contribute. A more
extra-curricular approach to university
life cannot be stressed enough, even
at an academia focused institution like
Imperial as it will grant a more rounded
and meaningful student experience.
I have a dream of an Imperial where
students strive to strike a perfect
balance between academia and often
forgotten extra-curriculars. I shall
achieve my vision by being voted as
the people’s representative in order
to synergistically forge the bridges
between the clubs and societies and
the Imperial College Union. I might not
be the most experienced but I more
than make up for that in passion and
creativity. Furthermore, if you believe
in honesty and transparency, I strictly
suggest you give consider me for vote
as I’m a straight shooter and what you
James Breakey see is what you get.
Policies include: Working alongside
DPFS on delivering clearer policies on
how funding pots (tour funding, ADF,
BUCS) are allocated. Granting the Union
responsibility to handle their own
general club issues independently whilst
Sport Imperial only handle bookings/
fixtures. Allowing management groups
chairs to sit on more sport boards for
better student representation. Campus
drinks prices match local competition
(e.g. The Slug). Finding better storage
facilities. Imperial sports teams must
have a snake-based mascot.

structure of the council and improve
these limitations. I’ve been the
Academic Representative of my

a member of the Student Council in
my school for four. I believe that these
positions have given me appropriate
experience in voicing the opinions of
the student population to authority
figures. If elected, I would deal with the
problem of intimidation by bridging
the gap between the student body and
the Council. In order to achieve this, I
suggest putting in place a simple and
anonymous platform for students to
propose their motions. Additionally, I
Roy Tal Dew would conduct meetings in smaller
groups to create a more open
atmosphere where students could
more comfortably approach council
members. I believe that these changes
would incentivise input across the entire
university rather than being restricted to
the loudest voices.
Lastly, I hope to raise awareness about
the Council by advertising important
information on social media, such as
Facebook. I’m confident this would
provide the average student with a
better understanding of union policy-
making.
