Gang
Signs and
Prayer
from his struggle with depres-
sion to misinterpretation of his
lyrics by mainstream media
“LBC’s trynna black ball me /
And trynna blame your boy
for knife crime”. Talking to
“The fader”, Stormzy said he
used this track to “deal with
all these people chatting shit”.
He wanted the album to start
like a “punch in the face”; and
it did.
One thing is very clear from
this album, Stormzy has three
main pillars in his life to lean
on when he’s struggling or
feeling low: his friends/ family
(his heart-warming admira-
tion for his mum in particular
is evident throughout the
album), his girlfriend, and
God. When he’s not spitting
venomous bars aimed at
anonymous paigons who
have pissed him off, Stormzy
dedicates the rest of this
album to them. Tracks like
Velvet/ Jenny Francis (Inter-
lude) and Cigarettes and
Cush sound like an extended
love letter to his girlfriend and
he even raps about marriage
on 21 Gun Salute. 100 bags
is a truly wonderful track,
the sort of track that will melt
fans’ hearts and make them
want to call their mums just
to say “I love you”. It begins
with a voicemail message
from his mum, praying that
he had a blessed day. Myself
and every other Ghanaian
can probably attest to receiv-
ing a similar message. Finally,
Stormzy’s dedication to his
Christian faith it is abundantly
clear throughout the album.
He raps on Velvet/ Jenny
Francis (Interlude), “The boys
wanna tease at my faith /
That’s just another reason to
pray”. Stormzy is a UK ver-
sion of Chance The Rapper:
They’re the same age, they’re
both absolutely winning right
now, they both seem to be
well-grounded characters,
universally liked by their
peers in the music industry,
and both are unafraid to
remain independent and use
their music to shine a light on
their faith and their relation-
ship with God.
It’s difficult to categorise this
album and that is a testament
to Stormzy’s versatility as an
artist. It is a grime album in
the loosest sense of the term
and you can’t help but feel
O
ver recent
years, the UK
grime and
urban scene
has had a
renaissance
and one man has been at the
forefront of this wave – the
WickedSkengMan live in
the flesh, Stormzy (Michael
Omari Jr.) In addition to his
raw musical talent, Stormzy’s
omnipresence on social
media: uploading daily
Snapchat stories, tweeting
regularly, and releasing
viral videos (the Stormzy
hype reached its peak with
the Shut Up video, which
propelled him to 8th
place
in the Christmas 2015 UK
Singles charts), has led to
him generating such a large
global fan base. Stormzy
had emerged as the ‘chosen
one’ of the new wave of
grime artists and, to justify
this hype, he simply had to
deliver a hard-hitting debut
album. The pressure was on,
and at the tail-end of 2016,
Stormzy went AWOL. He de-
activated all his social media
accounts and cancelled all
but one of his remaining live
shows, seemingly to finish
his highly anticipated album.
After a few months of silence,
Stormzy’s social media
started flickering back to life
and he launched a mysterious
billboard campaign across
London. The release of the
album’s lead single Big For
Your Boots soon followed.
Announcement of a UK tour
(now sold out) and a string of
surprise performances later,
including joining Ed Sheeran
on stage at the Brits to
perform a remix of Sheeran’s

that this was intentional. In
a recent interview with the
Guardian, Stormzy stressed
that he wants the same
respect as artists like Frank
Ocean or Adele. In other
words, Stormzy is not here
for the critics that want to
put him in the box of “grime
artist”. He is an artist in the
truest sense of the word and
this album is a beautiful blend
of genres that betrays the
fact that Stormzy’s artistry is
influenced by a wide range of
music. Listeners can tell that
every detail of this album has
been meticulously planned,
from his flawless return to
the scene and the build-up
to its release, to the choice
of guest artists who enhance
every track that they’re
Croydon mentioned bible
verses in a bar (“Brother, I’m
good, I stay with the lord /
Bible carrier, that’s my sword
/ Matthew 12, so I don’t
talk / John 19’s why I never
got caught”) that I actually
opened it. With this album,
Stormzy somehow found a
way for ‘gospel-grime’ to
make sense.
On the final track, Lay Me
Bare, we see Stormzy at his
most vulnerable as he gives
us an insight into his constant
battle with his own demons.
He addresses the resentment
he still holds towards his
absent father and further
details his struggles with
depression and his faith. On
the last track in particular,
Stormzy has humanised the
stereotype of the ‘angry black
man’.
Something I found particu-
larly inspiring is Stormzy’s
call to action for ‘young black
Kings’. His message is simple,
“if you want something, just
go and fucking do it”, and
he’s leading by example
by remaining independent
and launching his #Merky
label. As Stormzy describes
it, “black people have been
getting twanged for the long-
est”. Stormzy has recognised
the influence he currently has
over younger generations
and has used his position
and responsibility to prove
that a group of young black
boys can be successful. On
a lighter note, Stormzy also
made dark skin sexy again,
and for that I’ll always be
grateful. The release of this
album feels like it could be
a very big moment for the
grime scene, similar to how
Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in da
Corner album was important
for the genre. Time will tell if
Crazy Titch’s prediction that
Stormzy’s “about to take it
[grime] from a second rate
genre to a first rate genre”
will come true. I can’t help but
agree with Ghetts, who ends
his verse on Bad Boys (my
personal favourite track on
the album and one which ref-
erences the legendary Bashy
vs. Ghetts clash) with “It was
all calm before Stormzy /
Now it’s lightning”.

Cigarettes and Cush, gospel
on Blinded By Your Grace
and we hear him sing over a
chopped and screwed sample
of Nao’s Intro (Like Velvet) on

also has plenty of bars and
high-energy grime bangers,
like Cold and Return of the
Rucksack. With its hook,
“Dickhead yute and a dick-
head crew / Getting gassed
up by your dickhead friends”
and bars like, “Mum, if you’re
listening, close your ears /
But tell them paigons suck

AWOL \\
Bonobo
at O2
Academy
Brixton

T
his was a gig that,
due to Bonobo’s
incredible talent
and sense of sound,
engendered awe
throughout the
packed venue, however the
occasion was let down by
the poor sound setup at the
Academy.
As you walked in, the depth
of the bass notes was clear by
the vibrating felt throughout
the corridors as I waited to
hand in my jacket, eager
to join the crowd and get
ready for Bonobo (Simon
Green). Being the tour for
his new album Migration,
he opened up with several
class tracks such as Bombro
Koyo Ganda and No Reason.
With the drops of the songs
blasting throughout the crowd
and the light show offering
stunning visuals alongside the
projected panels of pictures
and bright, trippy artwork,
it was easy to get absorbed
into the music and the crowd
and dance along to the beat
heavy music.
As he played through his
set, throwing in other classics
from his previous albums
including Cirrus, Kong and
Kiara, each new song was
met with a wave of euphoria
among the crowd and cheer-
ing all around. Everyone
got drawn into each song,
every one of her songs.
This, however, is where I felt
the venue let the gig fall a tad
short. As was the case last
year when I saw Chet Faker
here; the vocals seemed to
be drowned out by the instru-
mentals for the most part,
with the mids sounding flat,
and barely carrying across to
the back of the venue.
Bonobo is a unique artist
that records his music with
instruments and produces
it electronically. It was
interesting to see how this
would be applied to a live
performance, especially with
the less instrumental-heavy
Migration album. However,
Bonobo did not disappoint,
perfectly replicating his music
onstage, while not only keep-
ing on par with the sound of
his tracks, but improving upon
them, with impeccable transi-
tions between them.
T
he venue’s facade
was bright and
fairly minimalist,
with white walls and
a simple entrance.
Inside, we were
surprised to hear techno
pumping out of the solid
sound system in front of us.
I looked around, noting the
royal blue walls decorated
by gold baroque detailing;
the interior felt both modern
and antiquated. Two tiers of
balconies encompassed the
dance floor and stage, giving
a vaudeville vibe. We learned
that the source of the techno
was Heathered Pearls (Jakub
Alexander), who was opening
for Tycho. The two have a
close working relationship:
both are signed to Ghostly
International, with Jakub
doing A+R for them too,
all while managing Tycho,
and curating his artwork
on the ISO50 blog (Tycho’s
moniker as an artist). His set
was neat and built nicely,
injecting some movement
into the audience. He joked
to the fledgling crowd about
permitting him to play techno
at 8pm, before introducing
Tycho and leaving.
The mood rose in response,
as the stalls steadily filled up
with people. Brought closer
to the stage by the influx, the
familiar gig funk of stale beer
and farts began to emanate
from the spectators. As you
would expect for IDM, a
label I hesitate to use for its
pretentious connotations, the
crowd was mostly male and
bespectacled, but there was
still an interesting mix of styles
– from new wave dreadlocks
on my left, to close fades and
muscle shirts on my right.
Tycho (Scott Hansen), has
been accompanied by a full
band on tour since 2010,
including Zac Brown on guitar
and bass, Rory O’Connor on
drums, and Joe Davancens
on bass guitar and keyboard.
After a brief introduction, the
band launched into their set.
Beginning with the grungier,
bass and drum heavy, new
album, Epoch, they worked
backward through their
discography. Stand out tracks
included Awake, Dive and
Past is Prologue, the titular
tracks from their respective
albums. Scott credited Roni
Size and the Bristol Drum &
Bass scene as musical influ-
ences for Past is Prologue,
his “first attempt at Drum &
Bass”. Much praise is due
for Rory’s heroic effort on
drums. Tycho’s vision as
ISO50 was felt throughout
the performance, with a
video backdrop showing
scenes of natural beauty,
family, ceremony, and the
female form, an often-double
exposed waking dream. It felt
like insight was given into the
nature of the band, with the
reverse chronological move-
ment from their latest album
to their eldest contrasting the
musical development of each
successive release. As each
track ended, the spell over
the crowd would be broken
and voices would bubble up
around us. Truly an immersive
audiovisual experience.
