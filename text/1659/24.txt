February
2016, a
tragedy
befell the
Royal
School of Mines in the dark
dingy depths of Falmouth. The
Bottle was lost! In the midst of
one of the biggest storms the
south coast had ever seen,
the RSM rugby players fell
victim to the CSM scum in
the muddy trenches. A year
later in the leafy suburbs
of Harlington a new mining
outfit strode out to make
battle, adorned in their new
windstopper jackets #stash. It
was time for the annual Bottle
Match, the world’s 2nd
oldest
rugby varsity, to commence.
With both sidelines cheering
and jeering the players on
with effervescent merriment,
the whistle sounded and Sam
Moorby got us underway.
After some strong defence
from RSM in the opposition
half, we were rewarded with
the first penalty of the match
and a chance for Moorby
to put the Black and Gold
in front, which he duly took.
CSM pitched the ball high off
the kick-off, RSM collected
and kicked back deep to
keep the pressure on the
Cornishmen. More good
defence resulted in a quick
turnover and after some good
phase-play from hard running
forwards, James Field spread
the ball wide to Dunning
who skilfully drew his man
and offloaded to Moorby to
canter over unopposed on
the left wing. Moorbs once
again held his nerve with
the boot to put us up by ten
points. From the restart, which
DNS collected in his usual
over-the-head fashion, RSM
kept up the same flowing and
accurate style of play, round-
ing off several good phases
with another penalty kick. Ten
minutes gone and with a 13
point lead, the bottle seemed
like it was on its way back to
the capital. CSM, however,
had other plans and came
storming back straight from
the kick off, piling the pres-
sure on to the RSM forwards
with good line speed and low
tackles. From a turnover they
worked it wide and with a
slipped tackle, dived over the
line to get themselves slightly
back into the game. 13-8 to
RSM. However, having their
lead cut only seemed to spur
the Londoners on. From the
next scrum on the halfway
line, and with a sizable
blindside to attack, no. eight
Zaboronsky took off in his
usual sideways fashion and,
ignoring calls for a pass from
the wing, broke through three
tackles before finally offload-
ing to set Amato up with some
clear air ahead of him and
only one covering defender
to beat. Using his quick feet
and outrageous pace, he
rounded the last man to dot
down and restore RSM’s
early dominance, to many
cheers from the Black and
Gold sideline. Moorby was
once again impeccable from
the tee, neatly bisecting the
posts from near the touchline.
This try seemed to get under
the skin of those in blue and
yellow shirts, with a few scuf-
fles erupting in the following
minutes, which the ref calmed
down with a severe scalding.
There followed a mundane
passage of play with both
sides committing many errors
and not being able to sustain
enough pressure to trouble
either defence. But, as if he
had sensed the game needed
sparking up, out of nowhere,
a thumping dump tackle by
Mike Wright landed a poor
CSM player flat on his back
and doubled over in pain. The
ref, however, feared for the
poor CSM player’s dignity in
front of all of his mates, and
showed Wright a yellow card
for his excellent technique.
But even being down to 14
men did not phase the RSM,
as they fought back hard to
get into the opposition 22.
Blackett won a penalty after
collecting a loose ball only to
be tackled high, with the CSM
attempted tackler having
to be taken off for a blood
replacement. Moorby easily
tapped over the penalty from
in front. Shortly after, CSM
were dealt another blow with
their captain having to be
stretchered off with a broken
leg, thus ending the first half
five minutes early.
Both teams came flying out
of the blocks for the second
period with more big hits and
outrageous steps. Everything
was going RSM’s way
though, as they got straight
back into the opposition half
and after some sustained
pressure, once again we spun
the ball wide and this time
Moorby turned provider to
put Captain Dunne (Ruairi
Ruairi Dunne, Ruairi Dunne,
Ruaaaairi Ruairi Dunne, nah
nah nah nah nah) through for
RSM’s third try of the match.
CSM came back with another
try through some offloads and
a bit of luck from the bounce
of the ball but Moorby gave
us some more breathing room
with two more penalties.
With two minutes to go, the
Cornishmen converted from a
wide move off a lineout within
our 22. However, shortly
after the kick off they knocked
on and Blackett sent the ball
into the crowds to the sound
of the whistle, kicking off the
wild celebrations and pitch
invasion. Dunne was hoisted
onto shoulders to receive the
bottle which he held aloft
to triumphant cheers from
the Black and Gold army.
The crowd and players then
returned to the union to place
the bottle in its rightful place
and celebrate their success.
Final score RSM 36-19 CSM.
The Bottle is home.
