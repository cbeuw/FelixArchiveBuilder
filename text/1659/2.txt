ello everyone. My name is Lef. Some
of you might know me from my reign of
terror as felix editor. Others might have
spotted me making short sustenance
runs to the union or the JCR (dem buns
tho...) and might have admired my
luscious locks or strong eye-liner game. Regardless of
your relationship with me, sexual or platonic, I’m here
to present my case to you and convince you to ‘elect’
me as your malevolent, tyrannical Dragon Emperor
Supreme.
First of all I will rename the Union, the ‘State’. The
State and I will be one and the same. I will make the
role hereditary. The elections will be replaced by
gladiatorial tournaments (these are purely for my
pleasure, and serve no electoral function), which will
conclude in foam parties.
No student will be left unfed. The streets will run
beige with curly fries and sweet potato fries will fill
your plates and your stomachs (beverages will cost
extra).
I pledge to listen to YOU. All of you. All the time.
Your dreams, your fears, your private desires. I want
to be in your head. Or, at least in your house. I promise
to bug every student’s accommodation and spend
resources to monitor the feeds. Non-stop.
But, perhaps most importantly, I promise to correct
the gender-ratio skew. I will end the awkward nights in
Metric, where single women are surrounded by packs
of hungry men. There will be no gender inequality in
this institution. I have no interest in women, so they
will all be banned and Imperial will become an all-
boys university. The dress-code will be shirt-optional.
On Friday, we’ll wear leather. I will smash the glass
ceiling, and rebuild the entire university out of glass.
Also felix will basically become Dazed and every
page will be a new-age arty centrefold. You’re
welcome.
Vote Lef 4 malevolent, tyrannical Dragon Emperor
Supreme. No one will listen to you as closely or as
carefully as I will. Vote Lef, vote experience, vote
leather.
