EXHIBITION
The sixties and seventies formed a
period of renaissance. It was an era
of change, engraved onto modern
culture forever because of its trade-
mark ‘hippy’ culture. Therefore, art,
being a form of expression of society,
underwent some changes as well.
The common perception of art is
restricted to those of oil paintings,
sculptures and sketches. However,
in the seventies, artists rebelled
against those traditional views and
ventured into different forms of
media such as installations, photog-
raphy, performance, film and video
to express their ideas about the
changes in their world.
With the emergence of computers
and binary code systems, the world
seemed to have evolved into a sim-
ple and organised system governed
by mathematical principles. And so
this exhibition opens with a look at
the cube as a form of art. A cube
is basically perfect by geometric
laws; the world simplified by scien-
tific discoveries and technological
progress could be seen as a cube.
Artists rebelled against this idea.
A striking example of the rebel-
lion would be Measurement: Room
(1969) by American artist Mel
Bochner. A room is mapped out by
black tape and the height and width
of the room are indicated. However,
the values given for the height,
length and width are nonsensical;
the piece challenges viewers to think
out of the box. It makes the viewers
rethink the real meaning behind
man-made measurements and leads
them to reconsider the efficacy of
efforts to understand the universe
through science and mathematics.
Newspapers, magazines, televi-
sionandencyclopaediashavealways
been relied upon as sources of infor-
mation. This exhibition includes a
piece by Andy Warhol called Mao
Tse Tung (1972). In this creation,
the picture of the late Communist
leader is repeated in various gar-
ish shades. This picture is a com-
mon poster picture placed all over
China at the time to inspire people
to conform to the rules of com-
munism. However, it is infamous
because of the attacks communism
received from the international
media. The artist is challenging
its credibility and our dependence
on these sources of information.
Perhaps the most melancholic
piece in this exhibition is a video
recorded by the Dutch-born artist
Bas Jan Ader. He recorded system-
atic acts of failure such as falling
out of a tree into a canal repeatedly.
What is strikingly highlighted in this
work is the inevitable tragedy that
all man-made systems are imper-
fect and fallible. It also serves as a
reminder, that in our search for con-
trol over different aspect of our lives,
we will always be powerless to some
force or fate or chaos that will always
have the upper hand in our destinies.
Contemporary art has always
been a challenging field. However,
this exhibition is a worthwhile
visit. Not only does it amaze you
with the creativity these artists
have employed to express their
ideas, but it also challenges you
and makes you reconsider truths
you have always taken for granted.
Considering the summer holidays
are starting soon, art aficionados
and newbies alike should consider
popping in to the Tate Modern for
a little life-changing experience!

Summertime
The sublime, the bizarre, the curious and the intriguing all on show at the Royal Academy
That seventies show
Angela Lee digs beyond the off-putting title for some contemporary art
EXHIBITION
Despite the rather tragically cold
start to June, there is some sign
that summer is indeed on its way,
albeit very slowly. Every year, the
beginning of June brings the open-
ing of the Royal Academy’s Summer
Exhibition, which, predictably, lasts
for the summer period, closing in
mid-August. This instalment is the
237th in a tradition that began in the
year of the Academy’s foundation,
1768.
The exhibition is the world’s
largest where anyone can submit
work for inclusion. Vast volumes of
work are submitted every year, and
only a fraction of it makes the cut.
Pieces by established artists and
members of the academy are dis-
played alongside the efforts of much
lesser known or even completely
unknown artists. The best of the
art that does not make the cut at
the Royal Academy is on show at
the Llewellyn Alexander Gallery in
Waterloo. These are the 1200 best
of the 8000 refused by the Royal
Academy on display and for sale at
the creatively titled ‘NOT The Royal
Academy: A Salon des Refusés’ run-
ning until the end of August.
The theme for this year’s Summer
Exhibition is ‘Multiples’, referring to
printmaking and related art forms.
Fortunately, this year’s theme has
lead to a somewhat more satisfy-
ing collection of art than last year’s
rather underperforming ‘Drawing’
theme. Despite the allocation of a
theme to every exhibition, there will
always be the full range of media
on show. Paintings, sculpture, draw-
ings, etchings, prints and architec-
tural drawings and models of a wide
variety of sizes are all there to be
seen.
What the addition of the ‘theme’
aspect of the exhibition allows the
curators to do is to showcase some
of the best of one particular form
of artistic expression. This year,
one was expecting some striking
and intriguing images, which are
after all what one would expect
from a medium that has so recently
received its revival, and this was
indeed delivered. The exhibition’s
first room was dedicated to prints
principally by artists from the US.
The Weston Rooms are tradition-
ally given over to prints, and here
too some interesting works were on
display.
However, after the first few rooms
of the exhibition, the ‘Multiples’
theme had pretty much flown out
of the proverbial window, which
does beg the question, why bother
with the theme at all? However,
this departure was not unappreci-
ated, particularly as I happen to like
sculpture and large canvases coated
in completely abstract splodges of
colour, which the Royal Academy
very obligingly provides every year.
Unfortunately, while this year’s
offerings are much more substantial
than last year’s drivel, the question
of how on earth the judges select
the contents of the exhibition does
always raise its ugly head. There are
always strong pieces on show that
may not be to everyone’s taste but
clearly show passion, creativity or
a powerful statement and comment
on life and society if not all of the
above, but there also some things
that do make you wonder about the
selection criteria. Paola Smith

“He recorded system-

Condensation Cube, Hans Haacker (1963)
● If contemporary art really isn’t
your thing, and neither is mod-
ern art, we would suggest the new
Joshua Reynolds exhibition at the
Tate Britain: Joshua Reynolds:
The Creation of Celebrity. This
Exhibition also runs until 18
September and explores the
art of Reynolds, one of the Royal
Academy’s founding fathers, and his
impact on the birth of the cult of the
celebrity. Tickets for the exhibition
are priced £5.50 for students and £7
for those unfortunate enough to be
paying full price. Evidently, the Tate
galleries all employ a standardised
charging scheme.
Heading back east down the river,
there is also now a new installation
in the Turbine Hall to be experi-
enced, the work of the architects
Herzog and de Meuron. This exhibi-
tion is definitely a little less infuriat-
ing than the last that graced the
Turbine Hall and should appeal to
all artistic tastes and preferences.
One Night Only, Allen Jones (2003). This is a sparkling example of a
piece that makes people question the sanity of the exhibition’s judges
