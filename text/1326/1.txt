Southside Bar acclaimed
● Bar placed second in national ‘Club of the Year’ competition
● Doors will close for final time on 24 June
● Over 3000 people sign petition for replacement
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Just weeks before it is due
to close, Southside Bar has
won a major national award.
Meanwhile, over 3000 people
have signed a petition call-
ing for the continued exist-
ence of “a Southside Bar” on
campus.
The bar was given the
runner-up award in the
Campaign for Real Ale
(CAMRA) ‘Club of the Year’
competition. CAMRA is an
independentconsumerorgan-
isation with over 75,000 mem-
bers. Having won through the
local and regional rounds,
Southside was narrowly beat-
en at the final stage by the
Hastings Club in Lytham St
Anne’s.
Steve Williams, CAMRA
Regional Director for Greater
London, told Felix that he
believes Southside is “the
greatest student bar in the
country” and “a worthy win-
ner of the award”.
“I’m really disappointed
that it’s closing,” he added.
“I think Imperial College
should be proud of this bar. It
shouldn’t be something that’s
just swept away.”
Southside Bar manager
Roger Pownall was delight-
ed to be presented with the
award and optimistic that his
bar could still have some sort
of future.
“We haven’t given up the
battle yet,” he said. “There’s
a bit of a fight going on and
we’re still trying to achieve
something.”
The Southside building,
which also contains halls of
residence and the College
health centre, is set for demo-
lition in July. Its replacement,
costing approximately £50m,
will be only six storeys high
instead of the current nine,
for reasons linked to planning
permission. It will contain 70
more beds, a new health cen-
tre and a small café, leaving
no room for a bar.
Imperial College Union was
given the option of using the
communal space in Linstead
HallforareplacementCollege
bar, but rejected it. “It would
be unfair to leave Linstead
students with no private com-
munal space,” said Union
President Mustafa Arif.
He added: “If we moved it to
Linstead, it would not be the
same Southside Bar anyway.
It would be much smaller and
it wouldn’t have the same
atmosphere.”
Tobias Dalton, chair of the
Real Ale Society, told Felix
that he expected at least 4000
people to have signed a peti-
tion in support of the ‘Save
Our Southside’ campaign by
the end of the term.
The campaign group
believes that there are other
suitable locations for a bar on
the South Kensington cam-
pus, and met recently with Mr
Arif to state their case.
“We had a long meeting,”
said Mr Dalton. “He [Mr Arif]
wasn’t so much on our side but
he understood us and seemed
keen to do something for us.
He’s putting in another claim
for space to the College.”
The situation is set to
worsen even further when
the Union bars in Beit Quad
are closed for refurbishment
next year. There are plans
to create a new bar when
Linstead Hall is rebuilt, but
this is unlikely to occur for
several years.
The second best bar in the country? Steve Williams, Regional Director of the Campaign for Real Ale, presents
Southside Bar manager Roger Pownall with the 2005 national ‘Club of the Year’ runner-up award
“Imperial College
should be proud of
this bar. It shouldn’t
be something that’s
just swept away”
