Mostly E’s - DOCTOR SPICE
So, you’re obviously a medic
– good for you. With all those
long hours in ﬁrms and other such
things, it’s about time that you set
yourself free from the ailments of
life and joined the rest of Imperial
for the biggest and best Summer
Ball yet. Held at the South Ken
campus with a gourmet dinner and
plenty of entertainments, all for the
bargain price of £45, what more
could you ask for?
Mostly A’s - GIMPERIAL SPICE
Your time at Imperial is spent
broadening your mind. You have
worked hard to attain your goal
of intellectual superiority. But
wait – you are only young and at
university once! You must add
balance to the force and let your
buns down, if only for one day of
the war between the rebels and the
republic. Let that day be 18 June,
the date of the Hollywood Summer
Ball! May the force be with you!
Mostly B’s - BABY SPICE
You have found a remarkable
balance between work and play,
something that not many people
can do, especially at Imperial,
well done! Everyone likes you
and thinks you’re good company,
which is why you have so many
friends. The only place to say
goodbye this year is in style at the
Summer Ball, with all your friends
around you, hanging off the arm of
your hunk of a boyfriend!
Mostly C’s - SPORTY SPICE
You’re an amazing chick; fun,
ﬂirtatious and fantastic in bed.
You don’t care what people say
about you as you’re so conﬁdent.
Your charisma and enthusiasm
infects all around you. Wherever
you go, you’re loved. You’re the
trendsetter, and a brilliant friend,
although sometimes your truthful
side may get the better of you!
We’ll be seeing you at the Ball no
matter what!
Mostly D’s - POSH SPICE
We’d like to tell you how amazing
you are, but you probably already
know! Sophistication is your forte.
You glide through life without a
care in the world as you know
that there’ll always be someone
to look after you. You take pride
in your appearance. Take the
Hollywood Summer Ball as another
opportunity to look fantastic,
as you always do with your
impeccable style and glamour.
Mostly E’s - SPLINTER
You might feel that you’re different
but you’re still part of the Imperial
family that we have all become so
fond of. Get out of your scrubs and
into some attractive attire to join
us in the biggest party of the year.
For a mere £25 (ents only) or £45
(dinner and ents) you can dance
the night away and with so much
to entertain you, how could you
refuse? Grab your tickets before
13 June to enjoy to fun!
Mostly A’s - DONATELLO
Imperial’s ﬁnest, keeping up the
high calibre reputation of the
College, we salute you! You’re
intelligent and inventive. After
spending the year working towards
getting that well-earned degree,
you need to peel yourself away
from the tools of your trade and
make 18 June a night to remember
by going to the Summer Ball.
Come and buy your tickets from
Union reception or Southside Bar.
Mostly B’s - LEONARDO
Your extraordinary abilities to
live life to the full by achieving
high academic goals and having
a fantastic social life tend to
amaze the majority. Reward
yourself by having a big bash
at the Hollywood Summer Ball
on 18 June. Clubs and societies
get £22.50 of every group of ten
tickets that they buy, so rush
down to the Union reception and
buy yours NOW!
Mostly C’s - RAPHAEL
You’re a ﬁne specimen of a man!
You’ve managed to use the eye of
the tiger to represent Imperial at
sport. On top of that, your ability to
imbibe vast quantities impresses
the ladies no end. Keep up the
steam, choo choo! You’re bound to
get a beautiful lady to escort you
to the ball; if not, you can go with
your buddies and have a fantastic
time keeping down the night’s
beverages whilst on the Waltzer!
Mostly D’s - MICHAELANGELO
Looking dapper throughout
College, with your perfectly gelled
hair and clean-shaven look that
we all love, you are going to be the
Darcy of the ball. Currently you’re
cutting a dash in the London social
scene but perhaps a funky evening
with your uni friends is what you
need to warm up for the long
summer parties ahead of you. Join
us at the Hollywood Summer Ball
on 18 June!
