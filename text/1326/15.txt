“Walk down the right back alley in
Sin City and you will find anything”,
says one of the film’s gruff-voiced
narrators. Anything, that is, includ-
ing gratuitous hyper-violence, shod-
dy acting, dialogue that’s cheesier
than fondue, and plot lines that
are about as plausible as London’s
Olympic bid.
Sin City tracks three separate sto-
ries that take place on the decadent
and depraved streets of Basin City.
The streets are lined with pimps,
prostitutes, and drug dealers – think
eighties Manchester and you’re get-
ting there. In the central plot, Marv
(Mickey Rourke) is out for revenge
for the murder of his lover, Goldie.
In a separate story-line, Hartigan
(Bruce Willis) is a policeman who is
framed and imprisoned for a crime
he didn’t commit (a bit like The A
Team). In the third story, Dwight
(Clive Owen) finds himself in the
middle of a gang war after getting
embroiled in a murder.
The disparate quality of the act-
ing and direction within the three
plot-lines damages the overall prod-
uct. For example, in the third story,
about Dwight, Clive Owen mumbles
his lines in an inscrutable mono-
tone. Whereas the likes of Mickey
Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica
Alba seem to adapt well to Sin
City’s unconventional comic-book
medium, some of the other less
prominent actors in the movie flap
around like fish out of water, com-
pletely out of place in Frank Miller’s
film neo-noir.
Sin City is also the most violent
film that’s spattered the cinema
screens for some time. It makes
Kill Bill look like The Care Bears.
Mutilation, decapitation, castration,
amputation – it’s like a fight between
Black and Decker and Bosch in a
crack lounge. But given that the
violence is highly stylised and that
the film is shot almost entirely in
black and white, we are spared the
realism that would leave any per-
manent disturbing effect – although
a particularly impressionable friend
admitted he was ‘baying for blood’
on the way back (to the shock of our
fellow passengers).
The trouble is that Robert
Rodriguez (like his mentor
Tarantino) sees violence as an end
in itself. This is something that will
put the more discerning viewers
– the ones who look for suspense
in movies – off watching Sin City.
The violence is not suspenseful, it’s
predictable and it contributes noth-
ing of any substance to the story. If
it wasn’t for the dazzling cinematog-
raphy, Jessica Alba and the fact that
I had to write this review, I would
probably have left halfway through.
In summary, you shouldn’t go into
the cinema with high hopes. Visually
it’s a stunning achievement, but
overall it’s not exactly Citizen Kane
is it?
