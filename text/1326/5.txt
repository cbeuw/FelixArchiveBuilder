The UK is facing a carbon
paradox. As the Government
strives to cut carbon dioxide
emissions by 60% by 2050, the
demand for energy is increas-
ing and so too is our depend-
ence on carbon dioxide-pro-
ducing power stations.
Over the next 20 years,
almost all our existing nucle-
ar power stations and most
coal-fired power stations will
close as they reach the end
of their operating lives. Then,
the UK will have to rely on
imported energy such as gas
and oil, often from politically
unstable countries. To reduce
our reliance on imports, the
Government has invested in
renewable energy sources
such as wind power, which
promise cleaner energy with-
out the carbon emissions.
Wind farms are high on
the Government’s agenda.
Controversial wind turbines
have sprung up across
Britain’s countryside and
there are plans for a further
2,000 by 2010 at a total cost of
around £9bn. Despite being
‘green’, wind turbines have
met with considerable resist-
ance. Opponents argue they
are ruining some of Britain’s
best-loved landscapes and
are an unreliable source of
energy.
One such critic, David
Anderson, who chairs the
energyboardattheInstitution
of Civil Engineers, refutes
the claim that wind power
will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. He calculates that
turbines could only reduce
Britain’s greenhouse gas
emissions by a maximum of
5%.
There are alternatives:
another solution to curb
emissions and maintain a
reliable energy supply would
be to clean up the act of the
well-established coal derived
energy.
Coal-fuelled power stations
currently supply 30% of the
UK’s electricity. Equally, they
are responsible for releas-
ing over a third of the total
carbon dioxide produced in
Britain. Coal is easy to store
and transport, and is acces-
sible from diverse suppliers
both here and abroad. Loads
in coal-fired stations can
also be varied easily, so coal-
fired generation is particu-
larly useful in meeting peak
demand or covering for sup-
ply intermittencies in other
fuels. Developing cleaner
coal that releases less carbon
dioxide would therefore have
huge benefits.
Various clean coal technol-
ogies already exist and aim to
use coal in an environmental-
ly friendly and economic way.
Clean coal can be achieved
either by targeting the pollut-
ants that result from burning
coal, or by developing more
thermally efficient systems
so that less coal generates
the same power. There are
also improved techniques for
gas cleaning, effluent treat-
ment and residue use or dis-
posal.
A new possibility is the
development of ultra-clean
coal. “Ultra-clean coal is seen
as something of a Holy Grail
in energy generation,” said
Dr Karen Steel of the School
of Chemical Environmental
and Mining Engineering,
University of Nottingham.
“It is a very efficient way of
producing electricity and it is
also much less harmful for the
environment.” Her team have
just been awarded £120,000
to help them kick start the
development of ultra-clean
coal which they believe could
make power generation 50%
more efficient and reduce
carbon dioxide release by a
third.
Mined coal contains about
15% mineral matter includ-
ing sulphates, oxides, clays,
quartz and carbonates, which
restrict its use. By definition,
ultra clean coals are coals
with less than 1% ash and
from which naturally occur-
ring minerals have been
removed by chemical clean-
ing.
CSIRO (the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation) in
Australia is the only other
organisation looking into the
manufacture of ultra-clean
coal. They have invested
$15m into a pilot-scale ultra-
clean coal operation that
has already yielded posi-
tive results demonstrating a
reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions.
The ultra-clean coal proc-
ess developed by CSIRO
utilises alkali/acid digestion
to dissolve the minerals out
of the coal under moderate
temperature and pressure
conditions, without the loss
of coal’s properties. The dis-
solved minerals are then
precipitated as gypsum and
aluminium silicates, which
are used in the building and
ceramics industries, while
the alkalis are regenerated
for reuse.
Dr Steel and her team are
hoping to develop a simi-
lar chemical leaching proc-
ess that has the potential to
reduce the mineral content
of coal to less than 0.1%. This
ensures a much greater effi-
ciency per tonne of coal and
up to a third less carbon diox-
ide pollution.
Most conventional coal-
fired power stations burn
coal to produce steam, which
turns turbines linked to a
generator. This process is
only around 37% efficient,
which means just over a third
of the energy potential of the
coal is converted into elec-
tricity. Unlike normal coal,
ultra-clean coal can be burnt
directly in gas turbines. Gas
turbines are similar to air-
craft jet engines and are a
muchmore efficient way of
using coal to make electricity
– but normal coal cannot be
used in them because their
impurities damage the tur-
bine blades. Ultra-clean coal
is therefore around 50% more
efficient than normal coal.
Commenting on the cost of
implementing this new tech-
nology, Dr Steel said: “There
has been an assumption that
it would be too expensive to
produce ultra-clean coal. But
our aim is to do it cheap, so
the coal will sell at about the
usual price.”
Ultra-clean coal could
also help reduce the world’s
dependence on oil, according
to Dr Steel. There are great-
er untapped reserves of coal,
and they are generally locat-
ed away from the politically
turbulent Middle East. For
example, China and the USA
both have large reserves of
coal, but not much oil. Coal
will also remain the domi-
nant generating fuel in large
parts of the developing world
such as China and India for
many years to come. This
could be beneficial for UK
industry, which could develop
business initiatives to pro-
mote and install cleaner coal
technologies in developing
countries.
Ultra-clean coal also will
be up against nuclear power.
The zero carbon emissions
associated with nuclear
plants are proving tempting
for the re-elected govern-
ment. But nuclear power sta-
tions tend to generate elec-
tricity at the same rate all
the time. This would provide
a baseline rate of power, but
would be too inflexible to deal
with sharp fluctuations in
consumer demand. The age-
old problem of storing radio-
active waste has also yet to
be solved.
Every method of energy
production has its pitfalls.
The only way the country can
keep up with the increasing
energy demand is to ensure
diversity in energy produc-
tion, some renewable, some
not. Although people were
quick to reject fossil fuels as
dirty fuels in favour of green-
er more renewable sources,
ultra-clean coal could ensure
that coal is back in the game.
The clean coal revolution
Green energy may not have to be renewable. Forget wind and solar power, ultra-clean coal may now
be the future for cleaner air. Emma-Lynn Donadieu investigates
Clean coal: a non-renewable solution to the energy crisis?
“Ultra-clean coals are
coals with less than
1% ash and from which
naturally occurring
minerals have been
removed”
“Ultra-clean coal is
seen as something of
a Holy Grail in energy
generation”
Leave your anti-gravity books at the door
In levitating frogs, scientists achieved both the almost impossible and the completely useless.
Tom Simonite looks at new research that may lead to a more useful applications of levitation
“What we want to do, for
a number of reasons, is to
make things float in mid-air,”
explains Peter King, a man
whose job is to defy gravity.
It sounds amazing, and he’s
getting better at it. This month
the latest refinements to his
technique were released,
along with video footage of
chunks of platinum, lead and
pound coins floating freely in
a glass jar. As a result he’s
been in demand – national
newspapers were interested,
television networks even trav-
elled across the Atlantic.
But King thinks they missed
the point: “You say you can
float something using a mag-
netic field, and ten minutes
later it’s ‘scientists discover
an antigravity machine’. This
is not quite what we’ve done
– we’re not having free trips
to Mars tomorrow in our anti-
gravity machine.”
So just what has King’s
research group at the
University of Nottingham
done? When he tells the story
his way, it emerges that an
elegant piece of research has
largely been ignored in favour
of the allure of the word ‘levi-
tation’ and myths of antigrav-
ity skateboards.
It turns out that levitation is
actually nothing new – water,
strawberries and frogs have
all been levitated before using
a phenomenon called diamag-
netism, as King explained:
“Diamagnetic materials abso-
lutely hate magnetic fields
and experience a force driv-
ing them out of them.” This
force can balance out gravity
and make things levitate, but
only up to a density like that
of water. This limits the use-
fulness of levitation, but in
2003 King’s group improved
on this by harnessing an
opposite effect.
It is another electro-
magnetic phenomenon
– paramagnetism – that is the
opposite of diamagnetism.
Paramagnetic materials are
strongly attracted to a mag-
netic field, and liquid oxygen
is one example. King found
that it could strongly enhance
levitation – as it strives to get
close to the electromagnet,
the liquid gas displaces the
floating material even higher.
Much denser materials like
diamond, platinum and lead
could now be levitated.
This was a major step for-
ward, but with a potentially
dangerous catch. Liquid oxy-
gen, rocket fuel, is massively
explosive. It made levitation
much more useful and dra-
matic, but its volatility ren-
dered applications outside
the lab unimaginable. The
real story of King’s recent
results is that he has solved
this potentially explosive
problem.
The secret is using a mix-
ture of liquid gases. Oxygen
is still used, but diluted to one
part in eight by calmer nitro-
gen: “You can actually dilute
oxygen a lot and still float
things pretty well. It’s clean
too – nitrogen and oxygen in
those proportions is just air.
If we lose that back into the
atmosphere, nobody shouts
at us.”
Safe, clean levitation of
dense objects allows more
useful applications than mak-
ing frogs ‘air sick’. First in
line is the mining industry
– levitating metals or gems
offers a more efficient way
of separating them from soil.
This is the real tale of King’s
latest research. Levitation
is in the end, perhaps liter-
ally, too down to earth for the
media circus, but hearing the
details of this story from the
horse’s mouth beats sci-fi
speculation hands down.
