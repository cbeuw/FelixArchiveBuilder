Can science make poverty history?
In the build-up to the UK’s G8 summit next month, the Antenna science news team
invites you to explore how science and technology – from renewable energy to GM
crops – could alleviate poverty in developing countries.

The hitchhiker’s guide to artificial intelligence
Should we develop machines with human intelligence and emotion, like Marvin the
paranoid android in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy? How would such machines
affect human relationships? Share your views on artificial intelligence with humanoid
and android experts.

Soldier or scientist?
How is UK science and technology influenced by the military funding it receives?
Sonja van Renssen attended a discussion at the Royal Institution
Imperial College is one of 29
universities in the UK doing
classified research for the
Ministry of Defence (MoD).
With nine such projects
underway, it sits at the upper
end of the scale for military
collaboration. To what extent
and in what direction are sci-
ence, engineering and tech-
nology in the UK influenced
by the military support they
receive? What are the ethi-
cal issues involved? And is a
weapons-based, hi-tech mili-
tary agenda the best way to
improve global security?
On Wednesday 11 May the
Royal Institution hosted a
debate that took as its start-
ing point the fact that about
a third of all public spending
on UK research and develop-
ment (R&D) stems from the
Ministry of Defence. Dr Chris
Langley, author of the report
Soldiers in the Laboratory
published by Scientists for
Global Responsibility (SGR)
in January 2005, Malcolm
Savidge, former Labour MP
for Aberdeen North, and
Professor Ron Smith, econo-
mist at Birkbeck College,
picked apart the complex sci-
ence-military relationship to
consider its implications at a
time when defence expendi-
tures are creeping up to Cold
War levels.
Military involvement in
R&D is by no means a recent
phenomenon. Nor are the
moral and ethical dilemmas
that surround it. Chair David
Dickson, Director of scidev.
net, opened the evening with
a pointed reminder of the
Manhattan Project, which
generated both military suc-
cess and protest movements.
With an election just gone
and Iraq still weighing heavy
on the agenda, the Trident
Nuclear Programme up for
discussion and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty to
undergo its five-year review
this month, the role of sci-
ence and technology in the
pursuit of military objectives
has risen to prominence once
again.
Langleyisworried.Hisshort
talk drew attention to the calls
for increased spending on
military technology outlined
in the White Paper Delivering
Security in a Changing World.
His greatest concern is that a
growing reliance on technol-
ogy in the national security
agenda tends to favour armed
intervention over diplomacy
as a means to resolve con-
flict. Funding and expertise
are pouring into military
solutions, diverting resources
away from research into the
underlying causes of wars,
such as poverty and climate
change. The UK’s pursuit of a
hi-tech, weapons-based mili-
tary agenda like that of the
US is not making the world a
safer place.
On this, Malcolm Savidge
seemed to agree. Although
he defended Labour’s track
record on defence with exam-
ples such as stronger export
control on UK arms sales,
he traced current policy to a
debatable desire to stay close
to the US and erase the ‘Old
Labour’ image. Criticising
Bush for his positive stance
on nuclear power, Savidge
introduced the eternal prob-
lem of dual use: civil technol-
ogy can be adapted to military
purposes and vice versa.
Professor Ron Smith took
this concept one step further.
The economist argued that a
distinction between science
with military potential and
that without is impossible.
In an entertaining anecdote,
he related how Louis Fry
Richardson, a Quaker and
meteorologist, fled to psy-
chology when there was men-
tion of using his work to study
the diffusion of poison gas.
Decades later, the mathemat-
ical models he subsequently
developed are the very foun-
dations of any War Studies
course. In any case, Smith
reminded listeners, the mili-
tary is increasingly buying
commercially available tech-
nology off the shelf instead of
investing in basic research.
But our inability to slot
military and civilian science
into separate boxes does not
free scientists, universities
and government from ethical
responsibility. Smith empha-
sised that history has deliv-
ered the scientist as patriot
as well as the conscientious
objector. The speakers con-
curred that universities’
increasingly commercial out-
look has facilitated military
partnerships in recent years.
The MoD continues to spit
out “small islands of infor-
mation in a sea of blather,”
as Langley eloquently put it.
There is a need for trans-
parency and accountability
among scientists, universities
and government. It’s only glo-
bal security at stake.
“...a growing
reliance on technology
in the national security
agenda favours armed
intervention over
diplomacy to resolve
conflict”
