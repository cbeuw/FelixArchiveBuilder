Virgins trounced
Women’s Sevens
Imperial 0-35 Brunel II
Imperial 0-35 UCL
Imperial 0-55 Brunel I
Imperial 0-45 Wye
By Wonkey
One groggy Sunday morn-
ing, six die-hard (or perhaps
foolish) Virgins were to be
found outside Beit Quad at
9am. Dappy wins the Random
Award for coming back all
the way from Cardiff, only
to decide she didn’t want to
come with us on our lovely
day out in the country after
all.
We finally assembled an
unlikely sevens line-up (there
were six of us) and estab-
lished that the rest of the
Virgins were blind drunk,
ill or otherwise in absentia
(all three, in one particular
case). We set off for UCL
’s
ground near St Albans (well,
near a motorway), via a ticket
munching train and a vaguely
dodgy £13 taxi ride.
On arrival, captain Felix
had arranged for a UCL
player to join us, and we
took stock of the situation.
There were four other teams:
Brunel Firsts (wearing their
England women’s rugby jack-
ets), Brunel Seconds, UCL
and our dear old friends from
Wye. Our slight discomfort
at the appearance of teams
with substitutes and coaches
was heightened further by the
sight of John Sykes (the Royal
School of Mines President)
strolling across the pitch look-
ing suspiciously like he was
going to be referee. Sadly he
declined our request for some
coaching assistance, so we
took it upon ourselves to try
to educate Armitage in time
for her first ever match.
The first match against
Brunel Seconds went rea-
sonably well. The Virgins put
up a good fight, with a lot
of commitment in defence,
but the attack took longer to
gel. Brunel outplayed us with
seven tries, although had we
drawn them later when we
had woken up we would have
put some points on the board.
UCL were a step up from
the previous game, but an
improved effort from the
Virgins meant the scoreline
was similar. Felix changed
the penalty-taking tactics
from the usual tap-and-go to
Wonkey kicking downfield for
touch, which slowed the game
down and enabled us to make
more ground. Again the team
showed huge commitment in
defence, but couldn’t break
through UCL
’s defensive line.
Brunel Firsts were the
team of the tournament,
finishing a totally expected
first overall. After listening
to John’s sage advice before
kick-off, the Virgins “kept it
in the forwards” with a huge
team effort, and managed to
contain the Brunel girls bet-
ter than any other team in the
first half. This may have been
helped by the intimidating
nature of the Virgins scrum,
which caused a quiet exple-
tive from the Brunel forwards
when we first packed down –
6’2” locks Felix and Armitage
moving to prop, budging usual
looseheadWonkey(veryheavy
but not as tall) to hooker – a
sight that even Men’s Firsts
Captain Hixxy called “scary”
when presented with it in
Southside.
The backline also pushed
up well in defence, with nota-
ble tackles from all three
Imperial backs, Thumper
(aka Bambi), Tumbles and
Cherrypicker, who also man-
aged a fantastic punt to clear
our lines from the 22. She was
so busy admiring the view
that she forgot to chase it.
Sadly, the Virgins were
exhausted in the second
half and much scrappier in
defence, enabling the classy
Brunel players to clean up by
55 points to nil.
By the final game, the
Virgins were feeling the
effects of playing without
subs, and although they put
up a good battle against Wye,
including an awesome lineout
steal from Felix, the game
was lost 45-0.
Highlights of the day
included Cherrypicker step-
ping up to take the drop-kicks
and restarts, despite endless
protestations that she couldn’t
do it (she could) and taking
over the scrum-half job half-
way through the day; Tumbles
having a blinder in both attack
and defence despite an early
injury; Thumper making her
usual fearless tackles and
remaining intact after a full
speed head-on collision with
Wonkey; Armitage making
outstanding runs and tackles
in her first game (and pos-
sibly backhanding someone,
but we won’t mention that);
Felix mauling away all day
while berating the rest of the
team for standing and watch-
ing (guilty, moi?); and Wonkey
catching her own stud in the
other bootlace and flooring
herself, totally confusing the
other team and herself in the
process.
In the playoff matches,
Brunel Firsts beat UCL to
take first place, and Wye beat
Brunel Seconds to take third.
Despite finishing 5th (and
there wasn’t even a wooden
spoon for us!), the Virgins
had an excellent day out and
enjoyed (finally) playing some
rugby again.
Our ‘supporters’, who
never actually made it to the
games, were tracked down
to Southside and forced to
listen to our tales of ‘glory’.
Felix and Tumbles shared the
player of the match award
(although somehow neither
of them drank it), Armitage
did her Virgin pint and the
lovely Ben gave us nice neck
massages.
RUGBY
Curling Club created
By David Willey
At the end of last term a
suicidal leap into Union red
tape was made by a couple
of brave third year students –
they went before the Athletics
Clubs Committee and pro-
posed the creation of a new
club. With some sweet talking
and support from some com-
mittee members, the idea of
a Curling Club was accepted.
Even more importantly, some
money was prised out of the
ACC’s tight fists.
With the money secured, an
event was scheduled, emails
were sent out and on the day
eight potential curlers turned
up. The Union minibus
weaved its way nervously out
of London and down the back
lanes of Kent, using a combi-
nation of internet directions,
AA roadmaps and scribbled
instructions on envelopes.
Our venue was located on a
farm, so once we had driven
through the yard, ignored the
dogs and cows and avoided
the barn, we arrived at the
shiny new Fenton Rink.
Once at the rink, we
adorned the appropriate foot-
wear, with one Teflon sole.
Then we ventured out onto
the ice to discover how slippy
the ‘Teflon versus ice’ com-
bination was. After an hour
and a half of slipping, sliding
and falling, we were all able
to send the stones in roughly
the right direction and at
roughly the right speed. One
intrepid curler soon found
out (to his detriment) that
standing up after releasing
the stone while still sliding is
a less than sensible idea.
So with the basics just about
achieved, we decided to have
a match. A couple of excit-
ing ends ensued with much
shouting and vigorous brush-
ing. There was a winning
team who were promised a
drink from the losing team,
but smiles were prevalent on
the faces of all participants.
The rink has now closed for
the summer but will reopen
in October. Look out for our
stand at next year’s Freshers
Fair and come join the Curling
Club.
