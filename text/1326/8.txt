Broadband bother
Hi,
I’m here to see whether you can
help. I’m in Wilson House at the
moment, and like most freshers in
halls, pay the college £30 a year for
high speed Broadband connections.
However, unlike most other halls,
we don’t get high speed broadband
connections. We don’t even get 56k
connections.
The hall has approximately 270
residents, but yet has only (from
what I was told when complaining)
a 2 Megabit line. This, to me, is quite
frankly appaling. I’m paying £30 for
a high speed connection that I’m
not getting, and in essence filling
the college with money they haven’t
even bothered providing a service
for.
When I rang up to complain (I
was trying to get some notes online,
but it was estimated to take several
days) I was met with ‘Well you only
pay £30, it’s still pretty good value.’
I don’t pay £30 for good value, I pay
£30 for a decent service at the qual-
ity and speed that people at other
halls get whilst paying the same!
They have refused to give me any
refund or compensation.
Thanks

Firstly may I apologise on behalf
of ICT, if it was a member of ICT
who gave you such an unaccept-
able reply. They should not have
replied in that way. They should
have given the positive news that
the new 100Mb line to Wilson House
has been laid and we are expecting
to be able to make it a live service
within the next two weeks. Since
ICT took over responsibility for the
Halls service, from Damovo, we
have been working on improving it
and specifically providing 100Mbs
links to Clayponds, Pembridge
and Wilson Halls in place of the
original 2Mb links. Clayponds and
Pembridge are done. Wilson has
taken rather longer because we
have had to dig up roads for the
fibre and getting council permis-
sion for such digging took some
time.
Listening about libraries
Dear Editor,
Helen Dawson (Letters, Felix 2
June) comments that the informal
meeting held with the student reps
recently was ‘an incredibly useful
discussion’. I would like to echo this
view. The students who came to talk
to us were constructive, positive,
articulate, full of good ideas, and
willing to listen – and this is exactly
the kind of relationship we need, to
help us develop and improve our
library services.
We already have regular termly
meetings with the Union President
andtheDeputyPresident(Education
and Welfare) but last week’s meet-
ing was so useful that we have now
agreed that we will also hold termly
meetings with the student reps as
well, so we can get a richer picture
of students’ views, to supplement
the feedback we get in other ways.
HelenalsoreferredtotheLibrary’s
10 year ‘plan’ and ‘closure’ of depart-
mental libraries. At this stage it is
probably more accurately described
as our 10 year vision, based on
observed trends, here at Imperial,
and at other research-led universi-
ties both in the UK and elsewhere,
and on the local context in which
we are operating. We all know how
much pressure there is on space
on the SK campus, and this, cou-
pled with the changing way in which
information is delivered and used,
and the students’ need for longer
library opening hours, has been a
major driver in decisions by some
departments to ask us to integrate
their departmental library into the
Central Library.
Our professional view is that this
trend is likely to continue over the
next 5-10 years, and that it would
therefore be better for the issues
to be acknowledged and openly dis-
cussed, and for a more coherent
long-term strategy to be developed.
This would help to ensure that eve-
ryone had adequate lead times to
plan such moves, that the students’
interests were understood and
taken into account, and that there
were clear policies about things like
appropriate provision of study space
– both in departments and in the
library. I hope that the proposed new
schedule of regular library meetings
with the student reps will help to
provide a forum for more discus-
sion about these and other library-
related issues.

More Wye worry
Dear Felix,
We in Wye eagerly awaited the
arrival of Felix last Friday, in the
hope that your interview with the
Deputy Rector might give some
of the answers that College still
seem unwilling to give us directly.
However, what we found was the
same old excuses, with a few extra
examples of contradictory state-
ments and College management
going back on their word on dif-
ferent days and to different audi-
ences howsoever suits their latest
purpose.
You were right to draw attention to
discrepancies between the guaran-
tees made in the initial press releas-
es, and the subsequent withdrawal
both of the 2005 intake in the affect-
ed courses and of earlier guarantees
that provision for current students
would not be affected (suggestions
for their course provision include
buying in block teaching, whereby
each module is taught intensively
over a couple of weeks and immedi-
ately followed by that examination,
as well as now refusing to rule out
the possibility that some teaching
will not take place on our campus;
neither option represents students
being “completely unaffected”).
Indeed, at the Deputy Rector’s
face-to-face event in Wye, a student
highlighted such inconsistencies, to
put into context students’ cynicism
towards the remaining promises.
The Deputy Rector was very quick
to deny any “bad faith”, with his
argument resting upon the premise
that the College never made such
initial guarantees and these were
a product of being “misquoted by
the student media” (in fact the
statement was in Reporter and on
Spectrum!); he thereby answered
the question of “bad faith” beyond
all reasonable doubt, but not in the
way he had intended.
That academic activity at Wye
makes a loss is undeniable, although
as your article shows, 60% of the
deficit in Life Sciences is from non-
Wye-based departments. The figures
for this deficit vary every time they
are quoted, and have never been put
into the context of the Faculty-wide
picture, longer-term trends, income
from other activities on the campus
or indeed the initial financial plan
agreed at the time of the merger,
which, rumour has it, gave Wye until
2009 to break even.
A statement in your interview
which Wye students definitely still
do not buy is that they have been
consulted and informed to an accept-
able extent. As evidence for this, the
Deputy Rector cites monthly meet-
ings with the Faculty and Campus
Union Presidents, which sounds like
a reasonable degree of communi-
cation. However, the current Life
Sciences President has yet to visit
Wye, and the frequency of meetings
with the Wye President is exagger-
ated and neglects to mention that
no such meetings took place until
January, more than five months
after the initial announcement of
course closures. Furthermore, such
meetings have focussed entirely on
changes to the Faculty academic
structure, with a flat refusal to dis-
cuss options for the future of the
campus, presumably until such a
time as all such plans are finalised
and beyond debate.
However, the inconsistencies in
the College’s statements that we,
as students, find most worrying or
even appalling are those relating
to academic standards. At the time
at which the closures were first
announced, various responses, both
public and private, suggested that
academic standards were a part of
the decision, referring to “research
ratings” (College Press release),
and “duplication” of London-based
courses “to a less rigorous stand-
ard” (the Deputy Rector quoted in
reports by the ICU President). When
the Deputy Rector visited Wye, he
was extremely emphatic in assuring
students that academically speaking
they had as much right to their place
at Imperial as the London-based
students, and the course closures
were not a slight against them or
the academic rigour of their degree
programmes, and this was certainly
reassuring to those students.
And yet now, when final year stu-
dents are within three weeks of
graduating, academic standards are
once again called into question, at
a time when we have just worked
our socks off through examinations
and are about to attempt to use
our degrees in seeking employ-
ment and further study. Perhaps the
comments refer only to research
ratings; perhaps any lower stand-
ards among undergraduates are
reflected in lower numbers of high-
er degree classes being awarded
rather than lower standards being
required to gain those degrees; but
this is not clarified in the article, and
with such disparaging comments
passed so freely whenever it suits
College management to do so, we
are left wondering whether the cer-
tificates we hope to gain in three
weeks’ time will be worth the paper
on which they are written, and are
left with little doubt that student
well-being is worth far less to the
powers-that-be than the College’s
wider reputation.
When Wye students pointed out
that national press carried stories
about the course closures before
students had heard about them, the
Deputy Rector was quick to dis-
miss the national media coverage
as “rubbish”. I shall interpret that
as meaning that such media cover-
age quoted our honourable College
management to the letter.
Yours sincerely,
A Wye student
