Imperial students win national business prize
A team of five Imperial students have won the 2005 IBM Universities Business Challenge. The winners were Saurabh Pandya, Zhi Lim, Chao Yi, Wei
Feng and Yi Zhang. Sir Richard Sykes, the Rector (far left), and Robert Berry from IBM (second left) presented them with the trophy and a cheque for
£1000. More than 130 teams entered the competition, which was run by Learning Dynamics and sponsored by several large companies including IBM.
The Imperial students acted as management consultants for a fictional brewery, wine bar and games company. Mr Pandya, the team leader, put their
success down to having “a culturally diverse team from different disciplines”.
