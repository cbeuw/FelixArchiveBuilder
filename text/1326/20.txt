By Khurrum Sheikh
Imperial’s first XI secured
their first victory of the sea-
son by clinching an absolute
nailbiter against the School
of Pharmacy at Harlington,
with a winning margin of just
eight runs.
With many regulars una-
vailable, stand-in skipper
Khurrum Sheikh led an inex-
perienced yet spirited side.
The day began well, with
Imperial winning the toss and
electing to bat first on one
of the hardest pitches that
the Harlington staff have ever
produced.
Ved and Sunkit opened for
Imperial and had to contend
with some fierce movement
off the pitch from the opening
bowlers. Imperial soon found
themselves a wicket down in
the fourth over with just four
runs on the board, bringing
the skipper to the crease.
After a slightly apprehen-
sive start, both Khurrum and
Ved looked comfortable and
set about building a partner-
ship, with Khurrum pounc-
ing on the persistent short
line with a few cracking pull
shots and Ved offering much-
needed support at the other
end. However, after a some-
what dubious leave, Ved was
adjudged leg before wicket
and found himself back in the
pavilion.
Brijesh bought some attack-
ing shots to the game and hit
two glorious boundaries to
force a bowling change. After
being tempted by another
loose delivery, he was unlucky
to be caught at mid-off after
scoring ten quick runs.
With the score now on just
34 for three after 12 overs, it
was imperative that Khurrum
stayed at the crease to pro-
vide some stability. He did
just that, whilst engineering
the bad balls into the gaps to
ensure that the scoreboard
was ticking along.
However, in the 18th over,
just after playing a glorious
cut shot for four, Khurrum
nicked a short one to the
keeper for a regulation catch.
Almost immediately, Imtiaz
was caught at point after
placing two glorious strokes
to the boundary, and it looked
like Imperial were heading
for a total under 100.
However, Sohaib Ali and
Ammar Akhtar both came to
the crease with a somewhat
different view. Ali pounced on
anything loose and showed
the fielding side a glorious
exhibition of pinch hitting.
At the other end, Ammar
pulled out a selection of
wristy strokes and some ath-
letic running between the
wickets. Between the two,
they contributed 49 runs to
the Imperial total, including
seven fine boundaries.
With some solid contribu-
tions down the order, Imperial
recovered from some early jit-
ters to post a low but respect-
able total of 127 all out.
Imperial’s fast bowlers, led
by Ben Evans, then produced
inspired spells of mostly
accurate and consistent line
and length. The School of
Pharmacy (SOP) had begun
brightly but soon found them-
selves two wickets down as
Ben cleverly had both open-
ers caught behind, with some
excellent catches from Ved.
However, after losing
another wicket, SOP set about
building a partnership. It was
clear that if they were going
to win this then they would
need contributions from all
the batsmen.
Ammar and Brijesh both
bowled exceptional spells
to support Ben, and were
rewarded with wickets.
Razza, batting at number
three for SOP
, looked in fine
form but was lucky to survive
a few close calls.
SOP were firmly on top with
the score at 119 for six with 10
overs to spare, needing just
nine runs for victory. It looked
as if Razza had almost sealed
the win for the away side as
he middled one straight back
at the bowler. More out of
hope and desperation than
anything else, Khurrum flung
his hand low to his left and
was amazed to see the ball
stick. Suddenly, with Razza
gone for a fine 46, Imperial
had a glimmer of hope.
Brijesh then produced an
exceptional over of full and
straight deliveries which
would have been difficult
for the top order to contend
with, let alone the tail-end-
ers. He took the remaining
wickets that Imperial so des-
perately wanted, and the face
of the game had completely
changed.
On the whole, this group
of young and inexperienced
cricketers produced a spir-
ited and memorable perform-
ance for Imperial. Many of
them were on their debuts
and, through a bit of luck and
some exceptional talent, were
rewarded with the victory.
This is clearly an indication
of the strength and depth of
ability in the Imperial squad.
These players will not forget
their debuts in a hurry.
