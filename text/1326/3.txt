Glazer flexes muscles
As Malcolm Glazer takes
over Manchester United, his
sons, Joel, Avran and Bryan,
are close by. Joel, 38, will be
Glazer’s main representative,
while David Gill will continue
as chief executive and Alex
Ferguson stays on as man-
ager.
The family’s other infamous
buy, Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
is currently in the control of
Malcolm, Joel and Bryan, all
of whom have had a signifi-
cant part in the running and
management of the American
football club. Apparently, this
experience will be useful for
running United.
Glazer has wasted no time
in entering the transfer mar-
ket, buying Edwin van der
Sar, the goalkeeper, from
Fulham for £2.5m.
No doubt the supporters
are wondering how they’ll
ever be able to afford a tick-
et for their next match as
Glazer recoups his £374m
debt through sky-high admis-
sion prices. Here’s one solu-
tion that could work: support
a football team that has real
future prospects!
Citigroup
Citigroup, the mammoth con-
glomerate investment bank,
may have to back down in it’s
position as lead underwriter
for the Initial Public Offering
(IPO) of China’s Construction
Bank. Citigroup’s main com-
petitors in this specific deal
include Deutsche Bank,
JPMorgan and HSBC, all of
whom have both an invest-
ment bank and a commercial
side.
Although it’s still early
days, it appears that China
Construction Bank’s deci-
sion was fuelled by Citigroup
reneging on part of the deal
where they agreed to buy
some of the stock. Although
the value of the deal is $175m,
not exactly one of the world’s
biggest, many banks are edg-
ing in for a piece of the action
in the current tight climate.
The Bank of America looks
set to win this particular
race.
Diageo Dies Down
Pernod Ricard’s takeover
of Allied Domecq is set to
progress even smoother as
Diageo removed itself as a
potential bidder for the firm.
The deal struck with Diageo
means Allied’s wine busi-
ness will be bought by Diageo
while Pernod Ricard buys the
Irish whiskey brand.
However, all is not perfect
as a consortium of firms led
by Constellation Brands of the
US, including the highly pres-
tigious pure investment bank
The Blackstone Group, may
launch a counter-offer, thus
putting the entire acquisition
at risk. Talks have moved the
share price of Allied up 1p to
£6.99. Now the waiting game
begins as we look to see if
the likes of Constellation will
intrude.
Songbird Makes Masses
A £100m+ offer is expected
for a 200,000 sq ft building
currenty let to CSFB at 17
Columbus Courtyard, Canary
Wharf. The owners of the
building, Songbird, a consor-
tium of firms and a certain
wealthy individual, plan to sell
the building to make a filthy
amount of profit from the
record high property prices.
As it continues in its selling
rampage, Songbird will also
probably put another build-
ing, 25 The North Colonnade,
on the market in the very
near future too.
FSA retaliates
Last month, Tony Blair made
aspeechinwhichhecalledthe
Financial Services Authority,
the authority regulating all
the financial institutions in
the city, “hugely inhibiting of
efficient business”. Of course,
the FSA was going to have
none of it.
Callum McCarthy, the FSA
chairman, has written to the
PM demanding clarification
and, if necessary, retraction
of his comments.
A spokesman for Gordon
Brown said the Chancellor,
who appointed Mr McCarthy
and has been a key supporter
oftheFSA,isalso“atonewith”
the sentiments expressed by
the Prime Minister.
Such remarks by may cause
upset and damage the influ-
ence, authority and prowess
of the FSA in its duty as City
regulator.
