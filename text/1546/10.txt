FRIDAY 10 MAY

‘In response to ‘The Miranda Ef-
fect’ 15th March:
Giulia, please don’t feel oﬀended but
you know Jackie f***ing Chan about
comedy. I said it once and I’ll say it
again: Miranda is the worst, most un-
demanding, lowest form of comedy
out there. You can’t even classify it as
slapstick – the acting is shoddy, ma-
terial bland, no ‘quotables’ and zero
relevance or message to it. On top of
it, this omnishambles is wrapped in
some utter devotion from TV execs
and the UK’s lowest common de-
nominator when imaginative moc-
kumentaries like ‘People Like Us’ or
‘People Just Do Nothing’ struggle to
get a series or be renewed.
Miranda fans – ‘you can change’
to paraphrase LCD Soundsystem
and start appreciating good com-
edy. I will start you oﬀ gently with
Arrested Development, taking it up
a notch with UK version of The Of-
ﬁce, followed by Alan Partridge,
then candidly onto Snuﬀ Box (Matt
Berry), escalating with A. Iannucci’s
The Thick of It, enticing you with
Charlie Brooker’s works, nearing the
climax with The Day Today & Brass
Eye (Chris Morris) and then and only
then, topping it oﬀ with Nathan Bar-
ley and Jam.
Don’t feel discouraged – Uni is
about discovering who you really are
as a person and your comedy choices
do reﬂect that a lot. I just feel you
haven’t probably been shown some
of that ‘good stuﬀ’ because let’s face
it, comedy-wise, Miranda is like the
last VHS in Oxfam – they won’t take
her anymore.
