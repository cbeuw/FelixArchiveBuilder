This week you’ve heard that
massaging breasts can in-
crease their size. You begin a
strict regime of mammary stimu-
lation on your girlfriend, and it
seems to be working as they
swell in size. You’re both delight-
ed, until they start growing down
aswellasout;beforeyouknowit
her nipples are swinging by her
belly-button. You’re dumped.
This week you are torn between
sexual frustration and your strict
revision schedule: 10 minutes
spentmasturbatingcouldbethe
difference between a 2.1 and
a first! You think about maths
proofs to distract you from your
throbbing genitals and manage
to last until the exam. But then
you accidently spaff all over
your answers and fail.
This week you’re enjoying the
sunshine until you sunbathe
on an ants nest. The ants are
so furious they bite the same
spot on your leg until they
eat right through. They then
crawl through your veins up
to your brain which they carry
back to their queen, one tiny
piece at a time. Should have
stayed inside revising…
This week you get a spray
tan to mask the translucence
induced by too much time in
the library. But you become
an unprecedented shade of
orange, emitting an eye-scar-
ring artificial glow. The phys-
ics department mistake you
for a source of radiation and
lock you in a lead box with all
their radioisotopes. Pint?
This week your teeth grow an
inch and become sharper ev-
ery time you masturbate. You
manage to be disciplined and
go a week at a time without
beating your meat, but even-
tually your fangs grow down
to your genitals. The next time
you get hard, the sharp enam-
el pierces your penis and you
die of blood loss/pain.
This week you grow a foot
long cat tail, and you are de-
lighted to find that you can
curl it round and insert it in
your vagina (and/or anus).
It’s like having a furry dildo,
which gives a curious but
pleasant sensation. But then
the fur starts to moult, and
clogs up your vagina like a
hairy tampon.
This week you get diarrhoea
and put a cork up your anus to
prevent unwanted leakage. But
during lectures, the pressure
builds up. The makeshift plug
lasts until your meeting with
your personal tutor, where it fires
out through your jeans at high
speed.Yoursemi-digestedjack-
et potato sprays all over his col-
lection of rare 1950s textbooks.
This week you eat so much piz-
za that you turn into one. Your
skin becomes the crust; your
eyeballs the pepperoni; your
blood the tomato sauce. The
pepperoni obscures your eye-
sight, so you blindly mistake
your arm for a slice of Domi-
nos. You die of tomato loss be-
fore you can find out if your ear
tasted better than your toes.
This week your blood turns to ink
from poisoning by all the revision
notes you’ve been writing. Un-
fortunately, the pigment in biros
cannot match the oxygen-trans-
porting abilities of haemoglobin,
and your tissues blacken and
die from hypoxia. The necrotic
process claims your eyes last,
forcing you to watch in horror as
your whole body withers away.
This week you stop showering
as a sneaky exam technique:
distract your coursemates
with your BO in the exam so
they can’t concentrate (or
even better, throw up all over
their answers from the smell),
then grades will be moderat-
ed up! You may well get that
elusive first, but at the cost of
lifetime social ostracism.
This week you decide that
your life sucks and wish you
could be anywhere in the
world except the library. A
genie grants your wish and
transports you to a desolate
warzone slum. You get bitten
by a rabid dog and die wal-
lowing in your own excrement.
Be careful what you wish for, it
could always be worse!
This week you must choose be-
tween ejaculating baby slugs
every time you come and hav-
ing tree branches for limbs. On
the one hand, firing slugs would
condemn you to lifelong sexual
dissatisfaction but on the other,
the branches would make it dif-
ficult to find anyone who would
sleep with you in the first place.
What’s it going to be?
