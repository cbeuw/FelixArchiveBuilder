mperial College doesn’t care
about its students and there’s
nothing we can do to change
it. The Sabbs are generally
powerless and many of the
Union’s decisions don’t seem to have
our best interests at heart.
Much like a certain yeasty (and
delicious) sandwich ﬁlling, those
statements will either strike a chord
with you or be they will dismissed
out of hand as an exaggeration. They
shouldn’t be. They sum up everything
that is wrong about Imperial; why the
NSS rating is so low, why we’re never
going to ‘beat’ Oxbridge, why the at-
tendance at the bars is falling and why
those controversial halls in North Ac-
ton are going to be built, whether you
like it or not.
College’s unrelenting apathy to-
wards its students and academic
staﬀ, its disregard for their views and
opinions is not a new development
(Holland Club/Translation Unit/bio-
science cuts anyone?) and only con-
tinues to drag Imperial down. With-
out an eﬀective Union countering
this, the slide into anonymity will be
even quicker.
Recently the Medics protested the
BUCS merger of Medic and College
sports teams. This is a contentious is-
sue, but only between the administra-
tors and the people actually playing
the sport. It is something even most
rival rugby players can agree on and
the reasons behind it are worth ex-
amining as they are endemic to Col-
lege thinking. Is having two separate
sports teams a historical relic or is it
upholding 148 years of tradition, 148
years that once lost can never be re-
covered? Why go through the eﬀort
of restructuring the whole system,
and if the sports teams are merged,
why stop there? Why not absorb the
whole Medic SU, make their Presi-
dent a DP(Medicine), make Reyn-
olds Eastside II and have done with
it? BUCS points. All universities are
ranked by BUCS points, which are
gained for doing well in sport with
the BUCS leagues. Imperial College
currently sits at 20th. If the Med-
ics’ points were included we’d go up
a place to 19th. I can’t even begin
to imagine how many more athletic
sporty people that extra spot is going
to attract. However, I believe the neg-
ative impact of the merger includes
less access to sports for everyone
and less money spent on sports as a
whole (for example, ICURFC and IC-
SMRFC both support 3 rugby teams.
If they merged, maintaining a total of
four teams would be more realistic)
let alone having to ﬁnd new Varsity
rivals.
“But I don’t care about them mess-
ing with the sports, I want to know
why they are still going to build those
halls that everybody is so against!”
They will carry on regardless because
I
Imperial College is good at business.
Really good, (for example the site of
the new campus in West London was
obtained cheaply through shrewd in-
vestment and property deals) and the
money has already been spent. Do
you think the developer is going to
refund the money for a few stickers
plastered around the Union build-
ing? The buildings are already being
built so stopping it is as likely being
served quickly in Metric on an ACC
night. Paul Beaumont was part of the
decisions and has been vehemently
against it from the start; look how
much they listened to him. Either his
inclusion was a box ticking exercise,
he was ineﬀective in putting his views
across, or a combination of both.
#Againstacton is trying to make a
diﬀerence but now his hands are tied
and it is too late, like trying to shut
the gate after the horse is already on
Tesco’s shelves. So now the halls are
deﬁnitely going to be built, the Union
should be pushing for a massive in-
crease in infrastructure like lobbying
the council to upgrade the roads and
cycle network around there (the pot-
holes are awful) or ﬁnd some money
in the inevitable proﬁts to run buses
between campuses. While the build-
ings are going to be built, meshing
this satellite campus with the exist-
ing services is an area that the Union
could really make a diﬀerence in.
So why do College disregard us so?
Why are they still going to build those
halls and merge the sports teams even
when nobody really wants it? You’ll
be gone in three years. In four years
no one will remember a time without
halls in North Acton or when Varsity
was Medics vs College; it will be the
norm to have an hour commute in as
a fresher and to play Varsity against
Roehampton. College will have made
money from their decisions, money
to help subsidise your labs, and the
person who made the relevant deci-
sions will still be in their job while
you’ll have graduated and be slaving
away, working 70+ hours a week in
a dingy oﬃce doing consultancy and
selling your soul so you won’t care ei-
ther. In my opinion, this game is too
short sighted for Imperial to play if
they have any aspirations other than
the ﬁnancial ones. The NSS ratings
will continue to slide, people’s expe-
rience here will become worse and
worse and the continued slip into
anonymity; academically, sportingly
and socially will hasten. To quote
Morpheus, IC “are the gatekeep-
ers. They are guarding all the doors,
they are holding all the keys. Which
means that sooner or later, someone
is going to have to ﬁght them.” While
I’m not advocating bending spoons,
stopping bullets with your hands or
anything else from the Matrix, some-
thing needs to be done and despite
greasing their palms handsomely, the
Sabbs don’t seem to have the stomach
or the weapons for this ﬁght.
So College doesn’t care and really
it’s not College’s problem, that’s why
they fund the Union; the Union is
supposed to be the brake on the slide.
Our voice, how we can tell the Col-
lege what we want and need. Unfor-
tunately our brake cable has been cut.
The Sabbs have very little inﬂuence
and nobody seems to make any real
progress. While this may seem harsh,
can anyone name any of the Deputy
Presidents from two years ago? And
what were their policies, what did
they achieve? Are the Freshers even
aware of Summerballgate that cost
their Union £128k? If that can slip
into dim and distant memory, what
hope do less notorious Oﬃcers hope
to achieve?
Obviously the Sabbs kept the Un-
ion working, they kept it ticking over
and that’s great. However from a
small team of people that we’re pay-
ing £186k a year I’d expect a lot more.
Yes, in 2011/12 we paid £186,098
for Sabbatical Salaries and accom-
modation. What do we get back
for this huge sum of money? Do we
even know if they are doing their job
properly? I hope they are and I would
hope that doing your job properly
consists of a lot more than keeping
the Union ticking over. In my naivety
I would assume that’s one of the jobs
of the hardworking team of perma-
nent Union staﬀ (~420k combined
salary in 2011/12). I want my elected
oﬃcers to ﬁght for change, to make
my time here better and to protect
my interests from the businessmen
who run IC. So have they done this?
They haven’t come close for me, but
what about the wider populous?
However, what I didn’t want was
these people that represent my views
to go out of their way to stop me en-
joying my time here. The list is long
and oft repeated; entry charges, tank-
ard prices and eﬀectively banning
yards are all factors that contribute
to the decline of any semblance of a
social scene and these are just within
the Union Bar!
Despite all these negativities social-
ness does still thrive, if you look for it.
I just wish that someone actually gave
a ha’penny for what we thought about
our time here when we’re not giving
them money or passing exams. I wish
the Union could ﬁght the good ﬁght
and support its students. I love being
at Imperial and have had a great three
years here already, but just think how
great this place could be; think of the
potential.
So why do
College dis-
regard us so?
... You’ll be
gone in three
years. In four
years no one
will remem-
ber a time
without halls
in North Ac-
ton or when
Varsity was
Medics vs
College
An uncaring university
