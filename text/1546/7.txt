take place in the future, and addition-
ally a consultation should be held now
with regards to the North Acton pro-
ject.
Finally, worried by lack of concrete
promises for wardening provision at
the new halls, a request was made that
the wardening ratios are maintained.
In 2011 Felix reported on a reduction
in wardening provision at Eastside
halls, with these rooms since convert-
ed to ‘Deluxe’ accommodation – with
a £250 per week price to match.
College respond
The Union received a one-and-a-half
page statement from the College’s
management board, the board that
authorised the purchase of the land in
North Acton. Their response covered
the majority of the points from.
The ﬁrst part of their report covered
their current view. They were keen to
stress the increase in bed spaces at the
newly refurbished Wilson House, due
to open ready for the next cohort of
students, as well as an upcoming in-
crease in bed spaces at Beit Hall, fol-
lowing the loss of East Basement.
One signiﬁcant point was noting
that Garden Hall will close next year,
due to “needing refurbishment”. It is
unclear as to whether College intend
to refurbish the property over the
next year, however it has disappeared
from the Accommodation website. It’s
sister hall, Weeks, remains, alongside
the temporary Paragon and Xenia.
Additionally, it was noted that
Evelyn Gardens would require some
work in the near future. Fisher Hall
has been mooted for closure in the
past due to the state of the premises,
though the impending expiry of the
lease caused College to ﬁle a joint
planning application with the Well-
come Trust to convert it into a nurs-
ing home.
College has stressed that they will
continue to look for cheap, close ac-
commodation. As part of this, they
are considering the future of Garden
Hall, Evelyn Gardens, and Pembridge
Hall, which hasn’t been mentioned
before. Pembridge currently houses
96 students, which College feel is too
small for the medium term, and the
hall may require extension.
Regarding Evelyn Gardens and Gar-
den Hall, College stated that struc-
tural inspection is needed of the halls,
which is intended to take place fol-
lowing the end of the academic year.
A consultation has been promised on
the ﬁndings by the end of 2013. Addi-
tionally, it is likely that some potential
proposals cannot be circulated with
the student body due to commercial
sensitivity, however Beaumont noted
that this likely means that Evelyn Gar-
dens lease will be looked into.
Finally, it was noted that College do
not make a proﬁt from accommoda-
tion charges, pointing out the cost of
building maintenance and property
values.
The way forward with North
Acton
Being the item of complaint with the
student body, a speciﬁc mention was
made of the North Acton develop-
ment. College have promised that
wardening provision will be made at
the new hall, in addition to the recep-
tionist service. It was not mentioned,
however, how many wardens there
would be in the new hall.
Additionally, the development
will go ahead, due to a contract be-
ing signed with property developer
Berkeley First. However, consulta-
tions will be undertaken with stu-
dents, wardens, and other members
of College staﬀ to ensure that the
correct steps are made on the way
forward.
Union Council step in
In a busy meeting of the Union Coun-
cil on April 30th, one of the main
agenda items was a response to the
College’s document. In the paper, also
by Beaumont, he listed a number of
points for the Council to improve.
They included:
• The Union should contribute posi-
tively to the new halls, regardless of
the outcome to Evelyn Gardens and
Garden Hall, and agree a consultation
procedure with the College as part of
this.
• That College should clarify what
they mean by being ‘committed to
providing a range of accommodation
options at a variety of prices, which
reﬂect quality and location’.
• That the Union President should
be included in commercially sensitive
negotiations.
• And that College should clarify the
refurbishment process of Garden Hall,
and what consultations may be part of
this.
At the meeting, Beaumont ex-
pressed how unusual it was to get a
response from College’s Management
Board, and how much of a good sign
this was. In addition to this, it was
conﬁrmed that Simon Harding-Roots,
Chief Operations Oﬃcer of Imperial
College, was currently engaging with
the Wellcome Trust to investigate the
lease issue of Evelyn Gardens,
Finally, in what appears to be the
beginnings of a formal consultation
process, a new working group has
been established by College to estab-
lish what use is made of space within
the new Acton development, amongst
other matters. This working group
consists of people including sabbati-
cal oﬃcers, members of College, and
a cross section of students at Imperial
College, covering those from all back-
grounds and natures. The fact that
such a working group exists is of huge
promise to many at Imperial, possibly
showing a gradual move towards a full
consultation.
