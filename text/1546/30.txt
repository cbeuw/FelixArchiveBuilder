After a hard fought weekend of match-
es, the Imperial Falcons rounded oÔ¨Ä
their season with an emphatic victory
over the UEA Blue Sox, giving us a
third-place Ô¨Ånish in the BUBA Spring
Cup.
The Falcons‚Äô cup campaign got oÔ¨Ä to
a shaky start on the Saturday as club
president Dan ‚ÄúWrong Gear!‚Äù Harris
stalled the minibus a grand total of
four times on the way to the ground.
Despite some equally dodgy navigat-
ing from general manager Vincent Li,
the team got to Croydon in time for
the Ô¨Årst match, with high hopes of a
successful tournament.
Imperial opened their campaign
against UCL, in a game that was ex-
pected to be a relatively easy victory.
The game was tight during the Ô¨Årst
two innings, as pitcher Hajime Urata
and the Imperial defence kept UCL
from scoring. The deadlock was bro-
ken, however, in the top of the fourth
inning as a number of Imperial errors
allowed UCL four runs. Fortunately,
Imperial managed to claw a couple
back in the bottom of that inning
against the pitching of UCL‚Äôs 50-Year-
Old Man.
Thanks to some excellent pitching
by Hajime, UCL failed to score in their
Ô¨Ånal inning, leaving us needing three
runs to win the game. A few batters
later, the game was tied at 4-4, with two
runners on and one out, with rookie
Simon Andersson stepping up to the
plate. On the third pitch, Simon sent
the ball Ô¨Çying towards right Ô¨Åeld; the
Imperial bench held its breath as the
ball hung in the air, only for it to come
down inches away from the Ô¨Åelder‚Äôs
outstretched arm. Sam O‚ÄôMullane ran
home, giving Simon a walk-oÔ¨Ä hit, and
giving Imperial a tense 5-4 victory.
Our next game, against the South-
ampton Mustangs, started in similar
fashion, with neither team scoring in
the Ô¨Årst two innings, thanks to some
tight pitching, this time by Vincent.
Once again, however, Imperial‚Äôs de-
fence cracked in the third inning, leav-
ing Southampton four runs up. The
Falcons only scored two in the top of
the fourth inning, but since it was a
timed game, another inning would be
played if we could end Southampton‚Äôs
inning in eight minutes. Fortunately,
Hajime returned to pitch a breathless
fourth inning, retiring Southampton
in six minutes to give Imperial a shot
at an unlikely victory. It wasn‚Äôt to be,
however, as the Falcons managed only
one run in their Ô¨Åfth inning, giving
Southampton a 5-3 victory.
The Sunday began with our Ô¨Ånal
group game against the (slightly hun-
gover) Nottingham Thieves; the Im-
perial bench swiftly exhausted the
supply of jokes about stealing bases.
Our defence made an excellent start,
which continued as starting pitcher
Sidney Louzon didn‚Äôt give up a single
run over the Ô¨Årst three innings. Mean-
while, Imperial‚Äôs oÔ¨Äense racked up the
runs, going into Nottingham‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal in-
nings 11-0 up. As Sidney tired, Not-
tingham began a late rally, but it wasn‚Äôt
enough as Julian Chiu struck out the
last of Nottingham‚Äôs oÔ¨Äense. The 11-6
win put Imperial through to the semi-
Ô¨Ånals, and another match against Not-
tingham.
The semi-Ô¨Ånal was much closer
than the group game, as Notting-
ham had mostly recovered from their
hangovers and brought on their better
pitcher. The score crept up, however,
and Imperial‚Äôs third inning began with
the Falcons 4-2 down. Despite the ‚Äúat-
bat from hell‚Äù (during which Simon
popped his shoulder and Julian pulled
his hamstring), we tacked on another
run, as Dan Harris came home in co-
medic fashion ‚Äì Dan tried to slide into
the plate, tripped over, and then (liter-
ally) crawled home as the opposition
catcher let the throw from 2nd base
through his legs.
Pitcher Hajime Urata shut Not-
tingham out in the top of the fourth
inning, leaving Imperial needing two
runs to win. Despite what he claimed
was a ‚Äúpotentially career ending, crip-
pling hamstring injury‚Äù, Kevin Mc-
Donald brought Yutaro Jimbo home
for the Ô¨Årst run, leaving Imperial with
one out and two men on base, looking
sure of victory. The Falcons could not
drive their advantage home, however,
meaning a Ô¨Åfth inning would be re-
quired. Unfortunately, during the top
of the Ô¨Åfth, Nottingham hit their stride
and hit four runs, leaving the Falcons
with a mountain to climb in the bot-
tom of the innings. Imperial failed to
score as Nottingham ran out 9-5 win-
ners, putting them through to the Ô¨Ånal
against ULJS.
Imperial went into the Ô¨Ånal game of
the tournament against the UEA Blue
Sox, competing for third place with a
depleted line-up, as the injuries had
Imperial Falcons claw onto third place

Baseball team put on impressive display, thankfully beating UCL
Come and tell me no hot drinks
in the computer room now
stacked up over the course of the week-
end. This was compounded when our
Ô¨Årst baseman left half way through the
Ô¨Årst inning to umpire the tournament
Ô¨Ånal. Fortunately, however, the lack of
fully-functional Ô¨Åelders proved not to
be a problem, as Imperial pitcher Yu-
taro struck out seven of the opposition
batters in the Ô¨Årst three innings, while
not giving up a single hit. Meanwhile,
Imperial‚Äôs oÔ¨Äense slowly built up the
score, going up 4-0 after three innings.
As the sun came out during the
top of the fourth inning, Yutaro con-
tinued his attempt to pitch a perfect
game, and may have succeeded if not
for emergency catcher Vincent, who
obstructed a batter, causing a balk
and costing Yutaro his perfect game.
Imperial added more runs during the
bottom of the inning, leaving UEA
needing 6 runs to make Imperial bat
again. Despite, some gallant oÔ¨Äense,
including a two-run home-run, Impe-
rial Ô¨Ånished the game as 6-2 winners,
sealing a third-place Ô¨Ånish in the tour-
nament; congratulations go to ULJS
for a well-deserved victory in the Ô¨Ånal.
The game against UEA was a great
end to a long season, in which we won
some, lost some and learnt the true
meaning of the word ‚Äúcold‚Äù. It‚Äôs been
great to see the freshers improving
throughout the season (special men-
tion to Simon, Jacques Smith and
Lewis Weinberger), and all the best for
the fourth years and Masters students
who leave at the end of the year.
