The Union has replied to the Col-
lege’s response to the Against Acton
campaign, started earlier this year fol-
lowing the unveiling of plans by the
College to construct a 724 bed hall of
residence in North Acton. Paul Beau-
mont, Union President, sent a list of
requests to the College, which went to
the Management Board in March.
The North Acton campaign mus-
tered large amounts of support from
the student body at Imperial College,
a body that has in the past been ac-
cused of not using their voice. A peti-
tion organized by the Union received
709 signatures, and a separate petition
from the Garden Hall Committee got
to 1,461.
Union’s Requests
Paul’s letter to the College comprised
of ﬁve key requests to resolve the
complaints of the student body. First
and foremost of these was to push
for keeping Garden Hall, one of the
cheapest and the most oversubscribed
Hall of Residence.
Alongside this, Beaumont argued
for retaining Evelyn Gardens, a group-
ing of ﬁve halls at Evelyn Gardens,
near Gloucester Road. The halls in
Evelyn Gardens are owned by the
Wellcome Trust, and are leased to the
College, though this lease is expiring
within the next few decades.
It was also of concern that the Ac-
commodation Survey, held in 2011,
may contain “discrepancies” when
compared to the Accommodation
Strategy. According to an article on
the Union’s website (now unavail-
able), data from the survey suggested
student’s want accommodation close
to College, at a price similar to that
charged by Evelyn Gardens.
Building on from this, Beaumont
argued that the North Acton project
should have had proper consultation
with stakeholders before the plans
were approved. In his requests, he
asked that such consultations
It’s exam season. Everyone at Imperial
is slaving away behind a desk, energy
drink of choice in hand. It’s the time
of year when ﬁnding a spare computer
in the Library is enough to make you
ecstatic, and noticing it’s not free and
someone is using the classic penny in
the arrow key trick will send you into
despair. So perhaps it’s not the best
time to be told that getting a ﬁrst isn’t
all there is to life.
In a letter to The Times, Profes-
sor Lord Robert Winston said
that “Scientists are best not ap-
pointed purely on the basis of
whether they had ﬁrst-class de-
grees; other human values are
important.” He went
on to say: “Success-
ful laboratories tend to be most ef-
fectively run with a happy collabo-
rative team, essential in almost
all science. Good degrees are
important but they are not
the only measure of suc-
cess.” Lord Winston wanted
to explain to those who as-
pire to a science degree that
science is not “harder”
than other academic
subject. The letter was clarifying what
he meant when sources reported a
conversation that took place during a
school visit.
Lord Winston is currently a Pro-
fessor of Science and Society and
Emeritus Professor of Fertility Stud-
ies at Imperial College London. He is
mostly known for his work in science
communication, including his recent
series Child of our Time.
