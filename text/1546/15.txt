FRIDAY 10 MAY 15
fter marching through
the tourists packing
Tower Bridge, I was
worried that the De-
sign Museum might be
hidden amongst the cafés and small
shops of the narrow brick walkways
lining the riverside. Of course, it
wasn’t. Bright, white, shining at the
end of, rather than part of, a shad-
owy almost-alley, it is a building that
exudes contemporary, minimal, and
understated.
The Designs of the Year show is
displayed in a single room which
greets you with a yellow interior and
block writing. Think... the shininess
of Westﬁelds in a museum. Perhaps
the exhibition’s venue, a centre de-
voted to design, makes one more
aware of its own layout. Although it
is no diﬀerent from galleries in the
Tate or Barbican you are instantly
more aware of where you tread even
before the exhibition begins.
The competition, run by the mu-
seum itself, is separated into sev-
en categories. It is categorised by
themes which link certain designs
rather than by functional category.
These include the way in which de-
sign communicates meaning, the
manipulation of science and technol-
ogy, the invitation to question and
interact, and also colour, function,
and memory.
On show were nominees and win-
ners. All are real-life designs and in-
clude the familiar such as the revamp
of Exhibition Road, the Shard, and
the Olympic Cauldron.
Some designs were interesting, but
hardly mind-blowing. Stop, stare, an
utterance of “oh” and onto the next.
Others seemed downright bad. For
some reason the furniture section
consisted of many uncomfortable
looking, stiﬀ chairs scattered around
the place made from anything from
wood to plastic, metal rings to iron
spikes, and bits of driftwood.
Nevertheless, many were intrigu-
ing and invited discussion, debate,
and sometimes admiration. A num-
ber of the architectural designs fell
into this category. They all displayed
that contemporary and modern vibe
emanating from the Design Museum
itself.
A particular highlight was the
Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, Neth-
erlands which is exactly that – a
mountain of books which form a li-
brary. Wooden frames reference the
barns of the local agricultural her-
itage and its homage to oversized,
majestic landscapes serves as a nifty
visual advert for reading.
Unfortunately, it is rather far for a
quick visit and so the Clapham One
Library is probably a more realistic
destination. It was diﬃcult to com-
pletely appreciate its design due to
only a couple of photos and a small-
scale model on display. But the mo-
saic-like pattern of the placing of the
windows had me at ﬁrst glance.
My favourite category was the
product designs. It was full of the
most innovative and original ideas.
For example, faceture vases, which
due to their handmade production
process, were all totally unique. Col-
oured resin is poured into a plastic
mould which slightly reshapes it as it
cools, and when the mould is peeled
away the triangular patterns stick out
at diﬀerent angles which reﬂect light
or form shadow emulating the eﬀect
of pixels on an image. Its style, al-
though dated, deﬁnes our digital era
– in a vase, who would have thought?
Not knowing much about cars and
bicycles, it was diﬃcult to decide
what to think about several of the
transport entries. Chainless bicycle
and cute small car? Sounds good to
me, I guess. What was an obviously
excellent idea though was the Air Ac-
cess wheelchair which can slot into
an aeroplane seat frame which pre-
vents disabled passengers from hav-
ing to be lifted onto stationary seats.
The fashion and graphics entries
were slightly disappointing. The for-
mer included collections from well
known names such as Giles Deacon,
Comme des Garcons, Louis Vuitton,
Prada, and Proenza Schouler but
I failed to see the reason for their
nominations above anything else. Al-
exa Chung for Madewell will do for
me thanks.
For a similar reason, none of the
graphical exhibits struck me as par-
ticularly innovative. Everyone is
aware of that chunky minimalist
font on a plain fuss-free background,
used just about everywhere is slight-
ly arty and modern. It was certainly
used just about everywhere in these
Lily Le reviews the Designs of the Year
entries.
The most interesting feature in
this category was the rebranding of
Australian cigarette packets. Identi-
cal, plain and plastered in ugly health
warnings, the brands are given a
small space to print their name on
an olive coloured background (ap-
parently the least pleasant colour to
see on a design). It is supposed to
demote brand loyalty (and obviously
put everyone oﬀ cigarettes) but most
interesting is its demonstration of
design in controlling consumer be-
haviour.
This time the tools are in the hands
of the government for the sake of
public health, treading on the toes of
design freedom. What cultural im-
plications will this have?
You may have noticed that I haven’t
mentioned any of the winners. The
overall victor was chosen from the
digital category.
I am not going to tell you but I will
tell you what it was not. It was not
the Windows Phone 8 app which
allows mobile devices to commu-
nicate by birdsong. Neither was it a
lightﬁeld camera that allows users to
manipulate the focus of the fore and
background of photos after they have
been taken.
I would suggest a visit to the De-
sign Museum to ﬁnd them out for
yourself. While debating whether the
winners are worthy, the signiﬁcance
of design comes to life. In an age
where we have the luxury of not hav-
ing to compromise between aesthet-
ics, function and trends, we forget
about the designs of products, which
we live around and base our worlds
on. It is a brilliant idea to remind us
of the importance of design by cel-
ebrating some of the best examples
in an immersive public forum.
The Design of the Year awards run
at the Design Museum until June 07.
Ticket prices around £12.
