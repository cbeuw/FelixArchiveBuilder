ith summer va-
cations just a
stone’s throw
away, it seemed
ideal for me to
think about possible summer desti-
nations. The ﬁrst thing that crosses
all our minds when thinking about
summer is, of course, sun, and con-
sequently we think about Mediter-
ranean countries. This article will be
dedicated to my personal home coun-
try, namely Greece.
Greece is quite a diverse country,
with beautiful beaches, small vil-
lages but also mountains and big cit-
ies, hence it has everything a tourist
would wish for. Below some of the
beauties will be presented. Of course,
these are just a small portion of the
sights in this country. Focus will not
be on the most touristic places, as
these are well known and reported,
but on the more hidden gems of this
country.
Crete, Falasarna beach
The biggest island in Greece, located
in the southern part of the country
combines the beauty of the sea and
the mountains. It is the perfect desti-
nation for anyone who wants to relax
from the humdrum of everyday life,
but at the same time wants to explore
the nightlife options.
One of my favourite beaches is
“Falasarna”, located in the western
part of the island. With the wonderful
combination of sun and sea, the beach
is also under protection through the
EU Natura 2000 project. It is quite a
big beach, thus even if it is crowded
you won’t feel suﬀocated as it usually
happens in the summertime. The only
drawback would have to be the north-
ern winds, making it sometimes diﬃ-
cult to swim and enjoy the sea. Other-
wise it is just the perfect place to go; it
is also close to Chania, one of the big
cities of the island, which oﬀers many
options for sightseeing, Greek cuisine
tasting and nightlife.
Kastoria
If the sea is not for you and you want
a place near the mountains, where it
is of course chillier, even during the
summer, then Kastoria is the place for
you. It is located in the North-west of
the country and it is a fairly small city,
oﬀering a vast range of activities and
sightseeing options.
What makes this city unique and
attracts visitors, is the magic atmos-
phere it conveys with the successful
combination of mountains and the
lake. One can walk aside the lake and
enjoy the fresh air and the scenery or
explore the inside of the city. There
are many byzantine churches, which
are worth a visit and also there is a
folklore museum, located inside an
old mansion, where one can travel
to the past and imagine how people
used to live. In the vicinity of the city
there is a Neolithic lakeshore settle-
ment, called “Dispilio”, located on the
lake, where one can admire the early
eﬀorts of mankind to establish resi-
dential areas.
For the more relaxed visitors, the
city oﬀers spectacular cuisine as well
and it is famous for the diﬀerent kinds
of pie and the traditional desserts.
Thessaloniki
Moving a bit to the south again the sec-
ond biggest city in Greece, Thessaloni-
ki, can be found, located directly by the
sea. The city itself oﬀers a wide range
of activities and sightseeing options.
There are many museums and also the
old town walls, where one can enjoy
the view of the whole city from above.
The most famous landmark of this city
is the “White tower”. One can go up the
tower and again admire the breathtak-
ing view of the city and the sea. My fa-
vourite activity in this city is walking by
the seaside, which is quite relaxing and
helps clear one’s mind.
In close vicinity to the city, just a
small drive away, one can go the beauti-
ful beaches of Chalkidiki and enjoy the
sun and the sea. My personal favourite
is the second “leg” of Chalkidiki, with
fewer visitors.
On the other hand, if you happen
to be a bit more adventurous person,
you can visit the highest mountain in
Greece “Olympus”, the mythical moun-
tain of the Gods, located 150 km from
Thessaloniki. Olympus is famous for its
hiking and walking paths, which can be
accessed throughout the year.
The city oﬀers restaurants with great
cuisine, which please even the most de-
manding food-lovers and it is the most
famous city for its nightlife opportuni-
ties and it’s called “the city that never
sleeps”…
As you can see Greece is a huge coun-
try with diﬀerent sceneries throughout
its area, so you can choose what is most
appropriate for you. Start packing,
Greece awaits you!!!
