Gavin Metcalf details the concerning rise of European lung cancer cases
ung cancer, particularly
non-small cell lung can-
cer (NSCLC), is one of the
most common forms of
cancer globally, with a very
poor survival rate: less than six per
cent of people diagnosed reach ﬁve
years post-diagnosis.
When one thinks of lung cancer
a variety of thoughts come to mind,
the foremost thought being smok-
ing, and this is certainly a large risk
factor. So much so that it is reported
that lung cancer will overtake breast
cancer as the largest cause of female
cancer death in Europe by 2015. This
has already been seen in Britain and
Poland, with lung cancer leapfrogging
breast cancer as the main cause of fe-
male cancer death.
The surge is attributed towards the
number of women who started smok-
ing in the 1960’s and 1970’s, say re-
searchers from the University of Mi-
lan.
The Europe-wide study by Professor
C.L. Vecchia reports that despite an
overall decline in cancer deaths, mor-
tality rates from lung cancer among
women continues to rise across the
continent, up seven percent to around
82,000 since 2009.

of Social and Preventive Medicine

“” in Switzerland, has told Cancer Re-
search UK: “The Key message for EU
national governments is tobacco con-
trol, particularly among middle-aged
men and women — the European
generations most heavily exposed to
smoking.
“If more people could be helped
and encouraged to give up smoking,
or not to take it up in the ﬁrst place,
hundreds of thousands of deaths from
cancer could be avoided each year in
Europe.”
The lung cancer death rate is sug-
gested to continue on its upward
trend for the next few years — but
with fewer young European women
now starting to smoke, it should pla-
teau sometime after 2020. There is
hope yet.
