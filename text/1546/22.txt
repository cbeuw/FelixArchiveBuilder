With tensions in North Korea con-
stantly on the rise, Gerard Butler’s
new action-packed outing tells a
story that doesn’t seem far too out of
reach.
Even in this ﬁctional world where
Butler is an ex-Secret Service agent
now demoted to work in the Treasury
Department, North Korea is causing
problems for the free world with their
endless nuclear missile tests. Natu-
rally, a meeting between the United
States and its ally South Korea takes
place in the White House, only for
this highly-secured engagement to
be hijacked by a guerrilla attack led
by the North Koreans.
Well-armed bad guys dressed as
tourists take over the White House
in a laughable instant, and it’s as
though the trained men who are sup-
posed to be guarding those highest in
the government forgot to come into
work prepared that day. Whatever
the reason, everyone falls like leaves,
in a pretty hilarious sequence that
shows the audience, in slow-motion
and backed by corny music, the gun-
ning down of agent after agent who
are helpless against the perfectly pre-
pared villains. There’s even a dog that
puts up a ﬁght. Subtlety isn’t exactly
the ﬁlm’s strong suit, nor should it be.
Trapped in an impenetrable under-
ground bunker with the terrorists is
the President (Eckhart), Secretary of
Defense (Leo), amongst others who
are played by less well-known faces,
which means they matter much less.
Not even the position of Vice Presi-
dent is worthy of having a relatively
famous name play him. (Poor Joe
Biden – this goes to show the public’s
general perception of that particular
position.) They’re pushed around and
kicked about, as they hold important
secrets that prove vital to the North
Koreans’ endgame. But enough about
them, where on earth is Butler ﬂexing
his hero muscles?
And so it’s the perfect time for re-
tired agent Mike Banning (Butler) to
jump back into action, and take on
these guys all by himself. It seems
like an unfair ﬁght, but not to worry;
Banning was one of the best agents
Lynne Jacobs (Bassett), the head of
Secret Services, had ever seen, which
means he can take on a number of
bad guys, even after 18 months of
being out of the ﬁeld, have all sorts
of injuries inﬂicted on him, and yet
walk away ﬁne from all the bloody
mess. That’s what “best” means – i.e.
superhuman.
Speaker of the House Allan Trum-
bull (Freeman) is now the Acting
President and, in turn, forms himself
a little emergency committee, which
is essentially full of self-important,
arrogant idiots who can’t do a single
useful thing in their stuﬀy meeting
room. In dire times such as this one,
Banning has no trouble speaking
freely, calling them out on their silly
errors, and generating some laughs
for the audience for his sheer audac-
ity.
Playing a man deﬁned by his brute
force and very little humanity, Butler
absolutely nails the role Bruce Willis
played more than a couple of decades
ago. He has no trouble looking con-
vincing as he beats someone to a pulp,
he is disturbingly calm as he tortures
someone for information, and he has
no trouble ﬁring oﬀ sly one-liners at
the bad guys. This role seems to have
been tailored for Butler, and he seems
to be comfortably in his place, doing
what he does best.
Other roles are very limited, as the
ﬁlm has barely enough time to de-
velop its central character. All those
taken hostage put on an admiring
level of bravery and patriotism, most
memorable being Leo’s Secretary of
Defense Ruth McMillan, who doesn’t
utter a single useful word for the ter-
rorists even after she’s punched and
kicked in ways no elderly woman
should ever be treated.
Yune has played a vicious North
Korean before in yet another high-
proﬁle ﬁlm, Die Another Day, and he
smoothly pulls oﬀ yet another one
of those as he makes crazy demands
and stares glaringly into the camera.
Under the assured hands of Fuqua,
the man who gave us Training Day,
Tears of the Sun, among others, he
isn’t one to shy away from brutal-
ity. There is a lot of fun to be had as
the unrestrained pitbull of Banning
ploughs his way through, saving the
day, although his mission is slightly
derailed by having to focus on saving
the President’s young son, the ﬁlm’s
weak point in selling the action.
It’s all incredibly silly, and this
makes one hope that the actual
White House does have better secu-
rity than what is demonstrated here.
Otherwise, if North Korea gets their
hands on a copy of this ﬁlm, we could
all be done for. And the shamelessly
patriotic message (any lingering shot
of the American ﬂag is an example)
may even have you unknowingly side
with the invaders. But all in all, it’s a
dumb, fun, easy watch.
