FRIDAY 10 MAY
22
Last month saw the fifth Polish
Short Film Festival come to London,
having made its journey around
the globe. We went on down to
Dalston (where else) to the cute lit-
tle Rio Cinema (think Notting Hill
Coronet, velveted squeaky chairs
type of place) to find out what ex-
actly Polish short films consist of.
As we entered, we were given
a score card to pick the best film.
The winner would receive 10,000
zloty – about £2000. Handing
out tiny amounts of power with
the ability to aid some stranger’s
film-making abilities may have
also been a nifty way of mak-
ing us really think about what
we thought of each film and why.
Out of the nine shown, my par-
ticular favourite was The Govern-
ance of Love. It opened up with a pic-
ture of a cat, which seemed to have
been sketched in wax crayons by a
child and a blurry-voiced narrator
declaring that he was a kitten. As the
story moved on, he seemed to jump
between his imagination and reality,
between different places and beings.
As audience members started
laughing at what seemed to be not
very funny scenes, it was clear that
the subtitles, though translating lit-
eral meaning, were not able to de-
pict the tone of the piece. It was a
great shame, as the film may have
had more of an impact had the na-
tive language been understood.
As the film unravelled, it was
clear that they were not the ram-
blings of a child nor someone trying
to be edgy. They were drawings and
stories of a patient with a mental dis-
order. His weird perspectives on life
struck up unpredicted connections
with the audience. It was a clever way
of giving us access to a world which
is sometimes sadly shunned away.
Only three films were live ac-
tion. Philosophical narrated ani-
mations, light-hearted and bright-
ly coloured stop-frames to pop
music, an eerie ‘Grizzly Tales for
Gruesome Kids’-esque black and
blood red cartoon, and a rather
dull compilation of scientific ar-
chive material formed the rest.
Of the live action pieces, a par-
ticular favourite was The Guard-
ians. A young officer must allow
only travellers with VISAs to pass a
barrier and continue their journey
into a misty forest. As he stamps
the papers of the travellers, he peers
intently at their faces with a sad-
ness he knows he should not show.
As a mother leaves her child and
husband behind, it becomes clear
as to where the travellers are going.
The simplicity yet complexity of
leaving loved ones behind appears.
Despite dealing with a cliché
subject, The Guardians retained
the air of mystery, emotion it de-
serves, yet had a explicit and tangi-
ble directness about it. It had more
of a depth than All Souls’ Day (girl
Short Waves: Polish Short Film Festival
Lily Le Film Writer hunts down long lost father and dis-
covers dead mother was not so per-
fect after all) and A Memory of Last
Summer (girl bumps into lost love
and they have sex in parents’ car).
Though the latter two played on
themes not unknown in contem-
porary cinema, they were nonethe-
less beautifully filmed with quirky
tones unique to each of them. This
was something which definitely
belonged in each piece of the fes-
tival. I couldn’t help but imagine
what would happen had the films
extended to a couple more hours.
