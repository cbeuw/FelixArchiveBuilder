Summer Short Reads
Maciej Matuszewski looks at five brilliant science fiction and
fantasy anthologies and short story collections – perfect for fitting
around your revision timetable
Solaris Rising
Ian Whates (ed.)
Rebelion Publishing
£7.99
The 2011 anthology Solaris Rising was
one of the ﬁnest collections of SF in
recent years and a welcome return
to the anthology game by the Solaris
imprint of Rebellion Publishing. Fans
of the book will therefore be pleased
to hear that the recently published So-
laris Rising 2 is a worthy successor to
the original. Edited by genre veteran
Ian Whates, Solaris Rising 2 brings us
orignial stories from over a dozen au-
thors – each just as imaginative, fresh,
and exciting as those in the ﬁrst book.
While the orignial focused mainly on
A-list authors the new book gives less
well known writers, such as Mercurio
Rivera and Vandana Singh, a chance to
show oﬀ their talents – I’m happy to
say that they don’t dissapoint.
The Unreal and the Real
Ursula Le Guin
Small Beer Press
£15.99 (each volume)
There are few who call themselves sci-
ence ﬁction fans, or indeed literature
fans in general, who have not read at
least some of Ursula Le Guin’s work.
Over a career spanning more than 50
years she has written over twenty nov-
els and many dozen short stories. Few
authors have done so much to blur the
lines between genre and traditional
literary ﬁction and this two volume
collection contains examples of both
sides of Le Guin’s work. The ﬁrst vol-
ume, Where On Earth, includes some
of her more realistic work – includ-
ing many of her Orsinian stories, set
in the eponymous ﬁctional European
country – while the second, Outer
Space, Inner Lands, focuses on her
more fantastical writing.

Benchmarks Continued
Algis Budrys
Harper Voyager
£16.99
Whilebestknownforhighlyacclaimed
novels such as Michaelmas and Rogue
Moon, Algis Budrys was also a proliﬁc
critic. The ﬁrst volume of his collect-
ed reviews, entitled Benchmarks and
containing his early work for Galaxy
Magazine, was published in 1985.
Now, thanks to the eﬀorts of Dave
Langford the second volume of the
collection, containing Budrys’ work
for The Magazine of Fantasy and Sci-
ence Fiction, has ﬁnally been released.
Witty and insightful the reviews touch
not only the individual books being
reviewed but also detail Budrys’ opin-
ions about the state of the genre. Not
only an interesting read this book is
also a time capsule from a vibrant and
important era for SF.
Stories
Ray Bradbury
Harper Voyager
£16.99 (each volume)
There are few speculative ﬁction writ-
ers who are as well known and as
highly acclaimed as Ray Bradbury. A
recipient of the US National Medal
of Arts he also received both the Fan-
tasy and SF Grand Master awards.
His work – well known for both its
imagination and literary quality – has
inspired countless modern writers.
This fascinating collection brings to-
gether all of his short work – including
the stories from the famous Martian
Chronicles – in two large volumes.
Not only are the stories fascinating
in themselves being collected in one
place allows the reader to explore
how Bradbury’s writing style and his
themes developed over time. Perfect
for both newcomers and old time fans.
The Weird
Ann & Jeﬀ VanderMeer (ed.)
Corvus
£25
The New Weird subgenre of specula-
tive ﬁction has grown signiﬁcantly
in recent years. Characterised by its
desire to abandon the traditional ste-
reotypes of fantasy and science ﬁction
and often incorporating elements of
literary ﬁction and horror, this sub-
genre is diﬃcult to deﬁne precisely.
Containing 110 stories, this book pro-
vides a detailed and fascinating cross
section of genres. Including work by a
wide range of highly acclaimed writers
such as William Gibson, George R.R.
Martin, Stephen King, Haruki Mu-
rakami, Mervyn Pearke, Neil Gaiman
and China Miéville this is a must buy,
even for those who might not have
previously thought themselves big
fans of the New Weird.
