FRIDAY 10 MAY

ithin the past
year experimen-
tal electronic
music has ex-
ploded into the
D.I.Y. cassette culture within the UK,
previously dominated by (but by no
means limited to) noise releases. Ste-
phen Bishop, head honcho of promi-
nent label Opal Tapes, spoke to me
about its formation, the themes that
run through its work and his opinions
on noise in electronic music.
Ross Gray: How did Opal Tapes
come about? There seems to have
been quite a resurgence in cassette-
based labels recently; did this in-
spire you?
Stephen Bishop: I started Opal Tapes
last July after considering starting a la-
bel for a while. It came to be at a time
when I really needed something to fo-
cus on and I just wanted to get busy
and release some music and have a
chat with some folks. I simply contact-
ed some artists whose work I enjoyed
and asked if they were interested in
doing a tape release. Things have just
rolled on since then, same principle,
and thankfully people have been really
receptive to it.
I buy a lot of music on tape and love
labels like Phaserprone, Ekhein, Belat-
en, always dug how even with dispar-
ity in the styles of music they’d cover
there was always a strong aesthetic
core to all the releases, something
which could be felt. Older noise labels
like Banned Productions, G.R.O.S.S.
and Broken Flag could have the same

said for them. Quietly characterful in
their own way. I’ve been around tapes
in music for as long as I can remember
really, whether as media or as source
material for musicians. Opal Tapes
is inspired by all of this of course but
the use of tape is not some bijou state-
ment. It’s a worthy format and one
which has been used continually since
its development all around the world.
People seem to forget that when they
approach this topic sometimes. At its
origin Opal is inspired by sound alone.
RG: In the releases you’ve put out
so far, Opal Tapes has demonstrat-
ed remarkable eclecticism, from
danceable techno to almost all out
noise, and yet as with the labels you
mentioned, there’s something that
seems to hold it all together. Do you
think that’s the case?
SB: It’s interesting to hear people say
that and I’d like to know what you
think that it is? I’m in the middle of
the sounds so see it diﬀerently. I think
one unifying theme
to the catalogue is
an altered approach.
Most of the releases
can be heard with
reference to house
or techno styles but
tend to bring about
a ﬁnal piece which
is often unsuitable
for the context that
is ascribed to it. For
example the Huerco
S. bits which have all
the composite parts
of a classic Chicago
house track but are
recomposed into a
diﬀerent environ-
ment and time/head
space. The groove
is still present but
the literal ecstasy is
nascent, transpar-
ent. I feel his music
is incredibly sad. I
do lean toward lis-
tening to electronics
which have a rougher edge to them,
like to hear pieces with a loose and
played quality. Perhaps these tenden-
cies are recognisable? I don’t really
know man [laughs].
So this idea of a reusing of genre
templates and a density and claustro-
phobia brought to it by adopting lo-ﬁ
techniques. That’s a good line that can
be drawn through Opal Tapes.
RG: I think for me it is a lot of things
you mentioned; there seems to be
this grittiness to all the record-
ings, and a running theme of ex-
perimentalism. I also feel like the
W
more danceﬂoor based productions
(if they could be called that) have a
tendency to bring in noisy elements.
It seems that there’s been more of a
push in general towards these kind
of noise / techno crossovers recent-
ly (e.g. Container) – do you think
the use of noise is becoming more
prevalent in electronic music?
SB: Noise and music is a strange thing.
Noise is essentially a lack of informa-
tion or an obscuring of it. Music is in-
formation. Whether the two are sym-
biotic with “noise-techno” etc I don’t
know. To me it’s not noise, it’s texture.
It’s musical information which is as
valid as a chord. If it were possible
to observe the ﬂux of textural choice
in electronic music then we may see
a rhythm forming where it ﬁnds va-
lidity and then falls back out. Listen
to Xenakis early work and the use
of “noise” or more realistically non-
traditional sound deployment is ever
present. Same with much of the early
electronic works of Europe and Amer-
ica. As such noise is not something
new but something which becomes
re-appropriated as music continues
its cycle.
With an artist like Container, I don’t
perceive his use of “noise” as state-
ment or anything so bold. To me it’s
just about urgency and latent energy.
The potential of the machine poking
through into the arrangement.
RG: On the subject of running
themes through
the Opal cata-
logue, could you
tell us a little
about the Mirror
& Gate series?
Seems like the
place where the
variety is dem-
onstrated most
markedly.
SB: Mirror & Gate
is a series of re-
leases which is put
together by myself
and Matthew Kent
of Blowing Up The
Workshop. We
both share similar
ears (though Matt’s
work a little better
than mine these
days) and after
months of emails
it seemed a good
extension for us
to bring together
artists we thought huddled under
the same brolly. The idea is as simple
as bringing two artists or groups to-
gether whose work shares similarities,
be they timbral or compositional, and
then sit them on a split together. The
tape split was common property with-
in noise/industrial/post-punk scenes
and I see no reason why it can’t func-
tion in the same way for more formed
musics.
RG: Any ﬁnal comments?
SB: Thank you everyone, artists, cus-
tomers, friends and family for helping
me with the label. Without you all it
is nothing but a chubby dude on Face-
book squinting at 3 a.m.

During a week’s worth of listening to
the radio an average of 0-3 new songs
make me drop everything, frown a lit-
tle in an eﬀort to identify the song /
artist, then ﬁddle a little with the time
bar on the listen-again player to ﬁgure
out what exactly the wonderful noise
is.
Last week this came in the form of
MS MR, a New York Duo whose de-
but album Secondhand Rapture is set
for release on the 14th May. As their
rereleased single “Hurricane” burst
onto the airwaves, the creepy intro of
what resembles a slowed down ver-
sion of a knife being sharpened was
attention grabbing enough within a
few seconds.
The vocals of Lizzy Plapinger
smoothly drip oﬀ the dark and slow
musical bed. True to pop music, they
are deﬁnitely the forefront of MS MR’s
style rather being given an equal
weight with the other instruments.
This is no bad thing. In a time satu-
rated with Adele / Winehouse-esque
vocals, it is kind of nice to go back to
a good American pop accent but with
more grit than Taylor Swift-type
vocals. Crudely, MS MR have been
compared to Lana and Florence but
personally I’d add a bit of Paramore
and Wild Beasts in the mix.
“Hurricane” is deﬁnitely the high-
light of Secondhand Rapture, being
the right mix of mystery, an apathetic
kind of sadness, and a musical depth
that a lot of pop songs compromise on
in order to build a good level of catchi-
ness. This depth is a vibe which runs
through the whole album and is prob-
ably thanks to the lovely way which
Plapinger ﬂoats over Hershenow’s
production, both of which quieten and
reﬂect, or suddenly burst into noise
(probably the reason for the Florence
comparisons) at the right times.
Other highlights include the way
which the word ‘buuurn’ is sung on
“Dark Woo Wop”, and “Salty Sweet”
which has a hidden darkness behind
its poppy façade.
It will be interesting to see the au-
dience which MS MR will draw in.
Slightly too poppy for the ‘indie-guitar’
fans, maybe not poppy enough to be-
come as mainstream as Lana; they’re
not the most original band around at
the moment but Secondhand Rapture
brings a temporary refreshing break
to the table that many artists currently
do not.
