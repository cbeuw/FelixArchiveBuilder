Imperial College’s Leon Vanstone
has been crowned the UK’s FameLab
champion 2013. In this annual hunt
for the nation’s best science commu-
nicators, each contestant has exactly
three minutes to impress a panel of
three judges. They may explain any
scientiﬁc concept but cannot use as-
sisting slides or large props. This year
the standard was very high and Leon
didn’t expect to beat the other ten
ﬁnalists. However he won over the
judges with his truly genuine enthu-
siasm when describing the landing of
NASA’s Mars Curiosity Rover.
Leon’s early interest in rockets and
engines led him to study Aeronautical
Engineering. His PhD is on hyperson-
ics, which involves studying how ﬂu-
ids (including air) travel over objects
at high speed. He has use of a wind
gun on campus which ﬁres air at an in-
credible 1.5km/s albeit for only 6mil-
liseconds at a time.
But Leon hasn’t always been a sci-
entist; he spent an unfulﬁlling year in
ﬁnancial services and has three suits
to show for it. However it was in an
orange skull-and-cross-bones t-shirt,
jeans and “skaties”, that he triumphed
in London last month.
Imperial student wins national
science communication competion
As an Outreach Postgraduate Am-
bassador for Imperial College, Leon
has extensive science communication
experience garnered from a diverse
range of presentations and demon-
strations (in one such demo he set
his hand on ﬁre which was exciting
but something he wouldn’t want to
repeat). He believes that you must al-
ways explain science to the best of your
knowledge. You must always think of
your audience. And if you reach the
edge of your understanding, admit it.
He also stresses that science commu-
nication isn’t just about the big stage.
It’s about talking to friends and family
about what you do. It’s about explain-
ing climate change to the person in the
street. But wanting to do it and taking
the time and eﬀort to do it well-- that’s
what makes the diﬀerence.

Royal Society Fellowships for
three Imperial scientists
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Three Imperial scientists have been
granted Fellowship of the Royal So-
ciety. Professor the Lord Ara Darzi
of Denham, Professor Joanna Haigh,
and Professor Sir Steve Bloom were all
recognised for their “contributions to
science, both in fundamental research
resulting in greater understanding,
and also in leading and directing sci-
entiﬁc and technological progress in
industry and research establishments”.
Lord Darzi holds a host of positions
with the Imperial College Health-
care NHS Trust and at Imperial. He
said that he was “honoured and de-
lighted” by the appointment, and said
that it was “humbling to be amongst a
group of such distinguished peers”. He
thanked his colleagues for their help
and support.
Professor Sir Steve Bloom is the
Head of Division for Diabetes, En-
docrinology and Metabolism, in the
Department of Medicine and Chief of
Service for Endocrinology and Pathol-
ogy in the Imperial College Health-
care NHS Trust. He said: “It is a very
pleasing honour for the entire team
who have worked together over many
years.” He added that it will spur him
on to work as there is much to still be
done, saying: “The world pandemic of
obesity causes great suﬀering,”
Professor Haigh, who is the Head
of the Department of Physics and the
President of the Royal Meteorologi-
cal Society, is mainly involved in re-
searching climate science.
The Royal Society, which was found-
ed in the 1600s, is a self-governing Fel-
lowship of many world class scientists.
Oﬃcially founded on 28 November
1660 the Society it was granted a Roy-
al Charter by King Charles II. Notable
former Presidents include Sir Isaac
Newton, Sir Humphry Davy, and Sir
Ernest Rutherford, to name a few.

RCS Motor race towards
competition success
Much celebration was had by mem-
bers of RCS Motor Club as Jezebel, the
vintage ﬁre engine they maintain, was
awarded ‘Second in Class’ at the 52nd
HCVS London to Brighton Run, held
last Sunday.
The HCVS London to Brighton
Run is an annual competition where
commercial vehicles aged 20 years or
older travel from Crystal Palace to
the Brighton seafront, where they are
judged for the quality of their restora-
tion. This is not to be confused with
the world famous Veterean Car Club
run that takes place every November,
organised by the Royal Automobile
Club.
This is not the ﬁrst time Jezebel has
won an award at this competition,
having come best in class in 2009.
However this award has additional
signiﬁcance being the ﬁrst time in
nearly four years that the aged mas-
cot has made it to the coastal city and
back under its own power. Last year it
didn’t enter due to being oﬀ the road
following a major mechanical failure
the previous November.
Chairman of the RCS Motor Club,
Stephen Ball, told Felix “[the motor
clubs are] a great way to show case the
extra-curricular clubs at Imperial,” be-
fore concluding “getting students out
and about and representing Imperial –
it’s exactly what the Mascots are there
for.”
