Professor G. ‘Anand’ Anandalingam
has been named the new Dean of Im-
perial College Business School and
Professor of Management Science. He
replaces Professor Dorothy Griﬃths
OBE who has been Head since Febru-
ary 2012.
He currently holds the position
as the Dean of the Robert H. Smith
School of Business at the University of
Maryland in USA, which is ranked in
the top 25 globally for the quality of its
programs. Professor Anandalingam
founded the Smith’s School Centre for
Electronic Markets and Enterprises
and was its director from 2001-2004.
He starts his new position at Impe-
rial on 1st August 2013.
A known expert in electronic mar-
kets and telecommunications net-
works, he has introduced several spe-
cialised Masters courses that aim to
expand the School’s global reach with
degrees and educational programmes
that will provide the students with
global experience. These courses have
raised over $40 million from philan-
thropic donors and corporate sup-
porters.
In an interview with Imperial Col-
lege, Professor G. Anandalingam said
“Academics in top institutions are
self-motivated to create knowledge
and disseminate it to their peers. I also
want to inspire and motivate them to
really take education and teaching se-
riously.”
He also added, “I think that we
should work on problems that have an
impact in the world rather than sim-
ply publish marginal papers for a small
group of peers, however reputed. We
all have the responsibility to make
a diﬀerence in the world and to do
things that will help those who cannot
help themselves whether in medicine,
science, engineering or business. I be-
lieve that one should not compromise
on ethics and social responsibility”.
He took his undergraduate degree at
Cambridge University and completed
his PhD at Harvard. Professor Anan-
dalingam has published more than 75
research papers and served as editor
of a number of academic journals.
He is also the co-author of the book
Beware of the Winner’s Curse, a book
which critically evaluates the technol-
ogy and dot.com boom of the 1990s.
In his spare time, he likes to play
tennis and describes himself as a “jazz
nut”. He also says he loves cooking and
throwing dinner parties and that he is
a big supporter of Tottenham Hotspur
and follows cricket. He is also a fan of
American football and baseball.
Sir Keith O’Nions, President and
Rector of Imperial said: “Anand’s pas-
sion to see Business students taught
really well and for them to do great
things in the world, his commitment
to research excellence, and his vi-
sion for engaging strongly outside the
School and the College made him the
outstanding choice to lead Imperial
College Business School.
“He brings a global perspective,
a talent for developing strong rela-
tionships with donors and industrial
partners, and has the experience of
working across disciplines that will
support the Business School’s focus
on academic excellence and help it
to ﬂourish within Imperial’s science,
technology and medicine-focussed
environment.
“At the same time as welcoming
Anand, I would like to thank Professor
Dot Griﬃths for serving as Dean of
the Business School for the last year,
which comes on top of outstanding
service to the School over many years.”
Professor Anandalingam said: “I’m
looking forward intensely to working
at Imperial College Business School,
an environment where the academics
conduct fantastic research, the stu-
dents are devoted to academic excel-
lence and the university’s reputation is
second-to-none.
“As the newest Faculty of this great
institution and thanks to my excellent
predecessors, the Business School has
done incredibly well in a short space
of time. I’m now very excited by the
chance to apply my connectivity and
experience towards making Impe-
rial even more proud of its Business
School.
“We have one of the best managed,
most nimble and entrepreneurial in-
stitutions in the world. It is simply a
matter of time before Imperial is con-
sidered to be the best global univer-
sity.”
