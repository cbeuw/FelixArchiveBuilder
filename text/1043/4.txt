Cool Telescope Blasts Off
Guilds Union Hits
"Unprecedented" Low
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Recent elections for City &
Guilds College Union's three
remaining posts on their execu-
tive committee were marred by
the low turnout of voters. The
lack of interest in the three posts
on offer, Honorary Secretary,
Entertainments Officer and
Publicity Officer, has been
blamed on poor publicity.
The posts should have been
filled at the last election in
February but no candidates came
forward at the time. Another
election was required to fill the
remaining seats.
The candidates for the
Guilds' Executive were elected
on 17th November, but only 57
engineers bothered to vote,
approximately 2% of those eligi-
ble. This turnout, though offi-
cially constitutional, marks an
"unprecedented" low in Guilds'
election history, falling signifi-
cantly short of last spring's
turnout by more than a factor of
three according to Guildsheet,
C&G's occasional publication.
Austin Jones of the C&G Union,
who proof-counted the ballot,
said the turnout was so low
because of the "lack of interest
and notification, and only one
person stood per post."
When asked how they man-
aged to cope with three vacant
posts, he said that everybody had
helped cover the work for each
post.
Some commentators noted
that the elections were hardly a
good result for the Constituent
College Unions in general, let
alone the C&GU, and should
cause concern for their long-
term future.

A new space based telescope, the
first of its kind, was launched
into orbit by the European space
agency last month. It will allow
astronomers to see planets and
star systems which are invisible
from earth. Professor Rowan-
Robinson of the physics depart-
ment says "This is very exciting
for IC because we are involved in
one of the major projects."
The infrared space observa-
tory (ISO) will be looking at IR
radiation, which can penetrate
the fog and dust that often sur-
rounds the objects of interest.
Earth based observatories cannot
detect this radiation because it is
absorbed by our atmosphere.
Rowan-Robinson and his col-
leagues will have about 215 hours
of 'open time' with the tele-
scope. They expect to find 10-
20,000 new galaxies ,"We are
hoping to observe galaxies in the
process of forming, this has never
Very chilly: ISO is one of the coldest
places in the universe
really been seen." he explained.
The results from ISO are due
around February and should help
astronomers understand how
galaxies evolve. Unfortunately
there is a snag with observing
infrared radiation. The telescope
must be cooled to around minus
270 degrees Celsius With liquid
helium, making it very chilly
indeed. When all the liquid heli-
um has evaporated, in around 18
months, the mission will end.
