Rachel Gossard and Neil I Iassard, the creative
driving force behind the shoe-gazers Slowdive,
have teamed up with some new members to
form Mojave 3. Tonight, their debut gig is a show-
case affair for the music industry and is held at the
cool and intimate Ronnie Scott's.
Arriving on rime, Mojave 3 slip, slide and
skate across our emotions, tugging at our heart
strings, and evoking an ever so delicate landscape,
somewhat reminiscent ol the eerie and haunting
Mazzy Star. One song, 'You're Beautiful', is
doubtlessly a nod to Nick Drake, while 'Pictures'
sounds like The Velvet Underground at their
uial Rii,
.a its best. 1
