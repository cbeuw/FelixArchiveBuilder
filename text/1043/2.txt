the miners have just walked off

The RSMU organisers have
complained bitterly that Rag did
not clear the customers out of
Da Vinci's before the event or
provide a cloakroom; both of
which had customarily been part
of Rag's responsibilities. But the
acrimony between Rag and the
RSMU goes back further, with

The door's open, but nobody's
coming in. Interest in Rag has
been fading.

College Examiners have decreed
that students will no longer be
allowed to bring their own calcu-
lators in to external examina-
tions, starting in the summer of
1996. Instead, they will be
issued with a standard depart-
ment-approved model incorpo-
rating the basic scientific opera-
tions.
The move to exclude stu-
dents own calculators was taken
earlier this month at a meeting of
the College Board of Examiners,
where concern over the increas-
ing sophistication of the
machines was discussed. In the
past, the instructions to candi-
dates sent to each student listed
a group of forbidden calculators,
considered too powerful for the
exams to be fair. Other calcula-
tors with memories or programs
had to have them wiped before
entering the examination room.
the RSMU executive taking an
increasing dislike over the past
few years to Rag's methods for
raising money, believing they
lacked any ethos.
Rob Park, speaking for the
Royal College of Science Union,
felt that more publicity would
not have gone amiss. "You need
publicity all the time," he said.
"When I told some people about
the event [after it had hap-
pened] they were interested like
anything".
On a happier note, Austin
Jones of the City and Guilds
Union said that they raised at
least £200 (the figure excludes
sums collected by Rag members
at the event). He added, though,
that a greater sum may have
been collected if the sabbaticals
took part in the Slave Auction.
That is not to say, however, that
the Sabbaticals have not been
getting involved, as proved by
Sarah White, who was flanned
twice during the week by the Hit
Squad.
Rag officials were unable to
comment on the total sum raised
so far this year.
Now, the Board of
Examiners have said that it is
unfeasible for invigilators to be
expected to check that every cal-
culator has been wiped, and hav-
ing every student with the same
calculator will 'level the field'.
Departments around the college
were consulted on their prefer-
ence for the standard machine,
and three calculators have been
shortlisted for further investiga-
tion. These are the Casio fx82
super, Casio fx85s and the Sharp
EL 532gh.
Vernon McClure, the
Academic Registrar, stressed
that there was no need for stu-
dents to purchase any of these
machines, as some will be avail-
able for familiarisation purposes
next term. He said that the
examiners decision would lead
to "parity of treatment" and
maintain the "integrity of the
examination."

Another Hall Burglary
Olave Hall, one of the college
halls on Knightsbridge, was vis-
ited by a burglar last Monday,
probably entering via a door that
was left propped open. The thief
broke into two rooms and stole
over a hundred pounds of cash.
...and Another
Linstead - A man was seen leav-
ing a room carrying a jar of tea.
He asked for some milk and left.
A small sum of cash and a watch
were later reported missing by
the occupant. This follows the
arrest of another intruder in
Weeks Hall on the 21st.
Police sources advise people
who see someone suspicious
should try. and record their facial
features and actions and call
security.

A union official was told her
request for information on IC
disciplinary proceedures 'caused
a great deal of amusement' this
week. Whilst researching for
Welfare Week, Julia Knight,
RCSU Welfare Rep, circulated a
letter to Wardens for informa-
tion concerning disciplinary pro-
cedure for offences in halls.
Professor Geoff New of
Falmouth Keogh Hall gave the
only reply. He said that he
assumed her request was not
meant to be taken seriously, but
that if it was she was under 'a
total misapprehension about dis-
cipline in IC in general.'
Professor New's response
was considered by many stu-
dents to be sarcastic and dismis-
sive, though questions have been
raised over whether or not Julia's
approach was justified. Miss
Knight said she "was very disap-
pointed" by his reply, "consider-
ing the serious nature of my ini-
tial request." The House
Chairman at Bernard Sunley
...and Last Week's
The man who was arrested and
charged with attempted burglary
in Weeks Hall last week is still in
custody. He is refusing to
answer any questions.
He was apprehended when
a student contacted Security
after she became suspicious of
his intent. He had barged into
her room and claimed he was
looking for a toilet.
It is believed that the man
may be a part of a trio of thieves
targeting IC this year.
Discipline Problems
A fourth year RSM student who
kicked a hole in a plasterboard
wall in the Concert Hall faced a
Union Disciplinary earlier this
week. The Committee accepted
his story that he thought it was a
solid brick wall and levied a £20
fine.
House thought that "it was an
insensitive reply... they [the war-
dens] are there for student wel-
fare.. I wish the warden would
re-examine his views, they
shouldn't be put forward in such
a blunt manner."
Although Prof New was
unable for comment, there was
little sympathy for Julia's letter
from other quarters. College
tutor Dr Gareth Jones, who
deals with welfare said that Miss
Knight "seems quite unaware of
the student disciplinary hand-
