Rag Week in the Red
BY M A R K BRIDGE
The Royal College of Science
Union's Beer Festival failed to
make a profit this year leaving
Rag Week in the red. The
Festival normally returns a
healthy amount for Rag's chari-
ties, but has fallen victim to the
dearth in interest that has blight-
ed Rag's efforts this year.
The Beer Festival itself
caused irritation for College and
Union alike as neither College
Catering, Estates, nor any of the
college licensees said they were
consulted about the event.
Further, a senior Rag source said
that Simon Cooper, the organis-
er, was warned that a loss was
very likely this year, as the event
had been running into difficul-
ties. The RCSU have agreed to
run several events to try and
make up for the very significant
losses, with astonishing reports
that over half the beer was not
touched.
The other events of Rag
Week have also been hit by low
attendances. The Guilds Slave
Auction could barely count more
than its organisers and potential
slaves as being present in the
U C H last thursday. Although
some of the regular events of the
week, including the flannings
performed by the Hit Squad,
have been popular, the Mines
Dirty Disco was under-patron-
ised.
Although Rag actually
played very little part in the
actual organisation of either of
the events beyond providing the
float for the Disco, and the capi-
tal for the Beer Festival, Rag offi-
cers are angry- at the Royal
School of Mines Union because
they will not hand over they the
proceeds of the Miners' Dirty
Disco event.
In a letter to Rag the day
after the Disco, the RSMU have
said that they will donate the
proceeds of their Disco directly
to the charity they chose.
However, after further commu-
nication with Rag, the RSMU
said they might supply them a
receipt from the beneficiaries of
the donation to allay fears that

Carpet Baggers!
Before and after: a still-unnamed Royal Holloway student can be
seen entering the Union on the night of Wednesday 11th of
November. The security video clearly shows the students leaving
Beit Quad just minutes later, bundling the I C U doormat out of the
front gate while President Sarah White and Ents D J Luke stand by.
RCSU Homeless
The RCSU has a new Vice
President, Ken Pritchard who
replaces Ruth Child.
Completely unconnected
with this are the problems they
have with their new temporary
offices in Biology. page 3
Hawking Lecture
The Royal Albert Hall was
packed last week when 5000
people came to hear a lecture by
Professor Stephen Hawking.
In the most well-attended
science lecture at the RAH since
1933, Hawking explained why

he had changed his mind about
the possibility of time travel. He
said that while subatomic parti-
cles may be able to travel back in
time, quantum theory dictates
that large objects such as human
beings certainly could not.
