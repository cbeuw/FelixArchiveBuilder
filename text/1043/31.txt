1. You buy a C D player and it
breaks down after 2 weeks.
The retailer repairs it but it
breaks down again. You ask
for your money back but are
told you can't have it because
you accepted a repair and so
can only have it repaired
again. Is this right?
a) Yes
b) N o
2. You buy a used car off a
private advertiser in the news-
paper. It was described as
"Red, Ford, R-Reg. as seen
£150". It's O K on a brief test
drive but it breaks down on
the way home. The seller says
it's "too bad". Can you get
your money back ?
a) Yes
b) N o
3. Your new washing machine
develops a fault and you want
it repaired. The seller tells
you that you will have to con-
tact the manufacturer whose
factory is several hundred
miles away because "he just
sells them and doesn't know
how to fix them." Do you
have to approach the manu-
facturer for a repair?
a) Yes
b) N o
4. You receive a large surprise
parcel. It contains a complete
set of dictionaries. Naturally
you are delighted. However,
two weeks later you receive a
bill for £2,000. You'd like to
send them back but can't
afford the postage. If you
keep them do you have to
pay?
a) Yes

WGKLD AIDS DAE
Friday December 1st is
World Aids Day. The idea is
not just to promote preventi-
tive practices such as safe sex
but to demonstrate support
and concern for people infect-
ed with H I V and A I D S and to
educate people in order to
fight prejudice.
The red ribbon is the interna-
tional symbol of aids aware-
ness, and was first worn in
Britain in November 1991 by
70,000 fans at the Freddie
Mercury Memorial concert at
Wembley Stadium. It was
conceived in 1991 by a small
charity called visual A I D S ,
based in N e w York. Wearing
a ribbon will show your
support but is only the first
step in the fight against A I D S ,
much more needs to be done.
For example;
* Services need to be main-
tained and developed for peo-
ple with H I V and A I D S .
* Prejudice and discriminato-
ry practices against those
either infected or affected
must be fought.
* More must be learnt about
the experiences of other coun-
tries.
* HIVprevention must be
given a higher national priori-
ty-
Information on A I D S , H I V
and related issues such as safe
sex and drug abuse will be
available during Welfare
Week. Further information is
available from the IC Union
or by contacting the organisa-
tions on the back page.
Answers:
1) No. Under the Supply and
Sale of Goods A c t 1994,
accepting a repair does not
mean acceptance o f the
goods.
2) No. A s long as the car is as
described and is "roadwor-
thy" (i.e. not dangerous) then
you have no recourse. Y o u
would have more rights had
the seller been a trader.
3) N o . Your contract is with
the seller. He should arrange
for repair.
4) N o . A s unsolicited goods
you have two options. Either
write to the supplier explain-
ing when and how he can
collect the goods or alterna-
tively do nothing. If they are
uncollected after 30 days or 6
months (respectively) then
they are your property.
BEWARE
BOGUS
AUCTIONS
AND
MAIL
ORDER
OFFERS
Sadly, there are people who
make a living by deceiving
others into parting with their
money, and students unfamil-
iar with their methods are
likely to be vulnerable. Two
examples of these are high
street "auction houses"
which appear to be selling
top quality goods at silly
prices and mail order sales
offers suggesting the recipi
ent has virtually won a major
prize, and requesting some
sort of response (usually
financial). Both these
schemes do operate within
the law but are both to be
avoided. Generally speaking,
if something appears to be
too good to be true it
probably is. Buyer beware!
