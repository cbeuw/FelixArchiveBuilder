Random Soccer Matches
Last Saturday RSM, despite
a 'donkey' keeper, managed an
easy win over Goldsmiths III on
Saturday, crushing them 6-1
away from home. It was the pre-
vious week's result, though, that
grabbed the eye more.
For all true sports fans out
there, it was the upset of the sea-
son. The Premier League leaders
QMW were coming to face
Third Division team RSM.
The scoring was opened,
surprisingly, by the RSM cap-
tain, with his first for the club.
However two soft goals in quick
succession gave QMW the lead,
but IC fought back, and were
Imperial College Rugby finally
got itself sorted out when they
recorded a seven-nil victory
against Wye College in the first
round of the Gutteridge Cup.
A superb first half display
resulted in an opportunist try for
captain Ian Oldham, which Kate
(or is it Claudia) Mayes duly con-
verted. IC pressure after half
time saw Tom Salter stopped
just short of the line after some
slick back play.
The referee then seemed
unduly keen to redress the bal-
ance, awarding several dubious
penalties against Imperial, with
Eric Cantona eventually taking
offence. Imperial though, held
firm, and solid form from John
Esser, Captain Oz and Chopper
Crossman helped to record an
outstanding victory, where
Imperial shone as a team and
fully deserved their win.
Another men's rugby team
was also in action this week, the
Royal College of Science, (RCS)
who beat SOAS by 15-8. RCS
were absolutely bombarded in
the first ten minutes by powerful
rewarded by an equaliser in the
shape of Si's delicate chip over
the keeper. The second half saw
QMW resurgent, yet IC coped
well with their continual pres-
sure, until the 70th minute when
a quick break presented Hamish
with a simple finish. The last 20
minutes saw QMW camped in
IC's half. With only seconds
remaining, a cross came into the
box to be met by the QMW cap-
tain who headed home only to
discover the ref had blown for
full time.3-2!
Their most recent match
this Wednesday saw their sixth
consecutive win, with the previ-
SOAS running, but after
regrouping, Imperial's players
showed their superiority, with
dominant forward play, swift
hands in the backs and a few
'howitzers' from stand-off Welsh
Git.
A 'well rehearsed' back
move then resulted in their new
fullback Giles 'Ladies Man' Gale
crashing over under the posts.
Unfortunately he was not quite
so outstanding in the bar after-
wards .
With the score 10-3 at the
break, SOAS began to come back
into the game in the second half,
but a well worked forward effort
from Captain Courageous him-
self allowed RCS to keep in
front.
The last ten minutes were
tense, with a series of 'out-
landish' penalties forcing RCS
back; SOAS, however, managed
to knock-on as they were cross-
ing the line to the relief by the
scientists' entire team.
This win was the best way to
get avenge their loss of four
weeks ago.
ously underrated Simon scoring
his fourth goal in three games.
After having all the play in the
first half, and most of it in the
second, the "Donkey" came
good and preserved his first
clean sheet of the season to safe-
guard a 1 -0 win.
Also playing this Wednesday
were the RSM second team, who
spent their afternoon scoring lots
goals and being denied many
more.
To say that the Royal Vet's
goalkeeper was the man of the
match after conceding seven
goals gives you some idea of the
utter walkover RSM II enjoyed.
INDOOR
ROWING?
On Sunday the 26th of
November, members of IC
Boat Club participated in the
British Indoor Rowing
Championships, held this year
in Reading. IC's main strength
was in the under-23 section,
traditionally a student event.
In the heats, IC finished
with six rowers in the the top
ten. The fastest time for the
2500 metre race was set by our
own Louis Attrill, finishing in
an outstanding 5 mins 57 sees.
The U23 final included
many GB internationals and
top athletes from this year's
Cambridge University Boat
Race Squad. In the final, Louis
Attrill finished first in 6.01,
four seconds ahead of
Sebastien Dawson-Bowling,
CUBC's 6'9" monster.
In the open final, the
German Ergo World
Champion Matthias Siejorvski
beat Greg Searle of GB by four
seconds, in a time of 5.46. That
result put Louis third overall in
the whole competition, beating
many top Senior Rowers!
Specky
Twat Twats
Beer
Monster
Like lambs to the slaughter we
got 'em and we got 'em good.
Their attack, defence and mid-
field fell apart. Unlucky!!!!
However, our skills were
silky and the hockey of a Mrjet
character. All goals were, of
course, Ferdinand-esque and the
Oxford reject scored a stunna
(reverse stick flick from the top
of the D, for those who are
interested). In their desperation
they resorted to violence:
Beermonster was whacked by
the Specky Twat and was thus
transformed into "Rhino
Woman". IC 7(Seven)-l
UMDS
HELL AT
IMPERIAL
Sixteen of ICs finest took up the
challenge to become the
College's Doom 2(the classic
PC shoot 'em up) champion.
The quarter finals went with
seeding, leaving only 6 competi-
tors. The semi-finals were a
complete shock with the 2 high-
est seeds being knocked out,
though David Ruescas had
admittedly set his configuration
wrong. The final between
P.Blakerman and C.Marston was
one sided with Marston winning
by a resounding 26 kills (or
frags) to 13.
Sport? Hmm.
TENNIS
ELBOWED
IC Tennis II headed up to
Sherburn, Yorkshire confident
that their sublime talent would
carry them to success. In the
event, things did not quite go to
plan, with IC beaten 71-37, but
it was at least a good effort. In
summary: "We were miles bet-
ter, and they had all the luck."
Hmm.
