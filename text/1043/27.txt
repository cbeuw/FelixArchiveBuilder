SPORT FELIX FRIDAY DECEMBER 1 ST 1 9 9 5 . TWENTY-SEVEN
IC Ladies Rugby, affectionately
known as the "IC Virgins", is
proud to be part of the fastest
growing sport in the country.
Over the past few years we
have blossomed into a very suc-
cessful team. Last year's excel-
lent season ended in a victorious
tour of Ireland, which was
enjoyed by everyone (particular-
ly Mr Arthur Guinness).
Ladies Rugby isn't purely
about mud, beer and men, it's a
great opportunity to keep fit and
have some fun, and to meet
other women; something of a
rarity at IC. Yes, we do get
muddy, and occasionally bruised
but mainly wc just have lots of
fun both on and off the pitch.
If any women out there are
interested in playing rugby,
don't be shy! Come along to any
of our training sessions. See the
club notice board for details. If
you'd like to meet us socially,
then come along to our video
night in Southside Disco Lounge
on Tuesday 5th December,
7.30pm. For more info contact
us via sian.evans@ic.ac.uk or in
her Geology PG pigeon hole.
Virginal Hopes Dashed
IC Virgins' hopes to build on
promising performances were
brought heavily down to earth in
losing to the Royal Vets by 40-0,
and this was largely self-inflict-
ed. With Catharine taking over
the captaincy, things went
downhill after conceding two
soft tries on the wing due to an
absence of three-quarter tack-
ling.
This aspect of the game is
most disappointing given the
efforts of the forwards, particu-

larly in the lineout which was
once again exemplary. The backs
ran poor lines and apart from a
late charge by fly-half Sarah
Corneille at no time looked like
scoring. This complete lack of
imagination and commitment is
simply not good enough and our
obvious regression in terms of
skill is embarrassing.
Virgins need to recover their
hunger and killer instinct if they
are to play the standard of rugby
they are well capable of.
FURTHER SUCCESS FOR
IC KARATE TEAMS
The BUSA Grade Regional
Championships were held in
High Wycombe on Sunday.
The _ULU team consisting
of Richard George and Richard
Webster of UCL, and Imperial's
Chris Leach and Richard
Tompkins were in the under-65
kg category. Unfortunately, due
to there being few others from
the Southern region, an amalga-
mation with a lower weight cat-
egory ensued.Everyone qualified
(excepting George, due to ill-
ness) to go on to the BUSA
finals in March, and the London
boys took three of the top four
placings.

The result could have been so
different; it seemed that each
player started well but managed
to choke fairly drastically.
Perhaps the newly appointed
psychologist will renew their
desire to win.
