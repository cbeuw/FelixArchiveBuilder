The Royal College of Science
Union will be homeless when
they leave their current site this
weekend. As reported in Felix
1042, the RCSU is soon to move
temporarily to the Biology
department, due to the immi-
nent demolition of their current
premises in the Old Chemistry
Building. The Union is scheduled
to move permanently to the
Civil Engineering Department
later next term.
The RCSU Honorary
Secretary, Stuart Jenkins, told
Felix that the current office has
to be vacated by Monday,
though the Union is hoping to be
out by Saturday night. However,
the room in Biology set aside for
them is not available until
Wednesday.
Further problems are
expected with the 24 hr-swipe
continued from page 2
book, in which disciplinary pro-
cedures are spelled out." Though
he did concede that the response
was needlessly terse "I think you
could be put off... though there
is an invitation to discuss this."
At present, students receive
guidance on disciplinary policy
from the college published
Freshers' Handbook, and from
the Wardens of their respective
halls of residence. There are no
set punishments for certain
offences, which are instead dealt
with on a case-by-case basis.
Sarah White, ICU president,
was unsympathetic, claiming
that Miss Knight misunderstood

card access that the Biology
department operates. There are,
Stuart added, "no possibilities
for people wanting to buy
regalia, tickets, etc." Rob Park,
their Publicity Officer, added
"We'll have to store our non-
essentials in the Queen's
Tower," which includes the
Gestetner printer used for
Broadsheet. The property of the
president, vice-president and
honorary secretary is likely to get
moved to Biology, with the
remainder going into storage.
As for the Biology Depart-
ment accessibility problem, he
said that this "is being investigat-
ed by the exec" with a view to
increasing the access, though he
did appreciate that there was a
need for security. Despite the
difficulties however, it is hoped
that they will be able to have "a
skeleton-type service running."
the task for which she had vol-
unteered. Miss White added that
she had received letters of
enquiry from some of the hall
wardens who had been contact-
ed by the Welfare Rep, express-
ing surprise at the fact that this
approach was being used given
that such information was freely
available.
Miss White maintained that
Julia should really have been
examining topics like student
housing rights and similar sub-
jects under the banner of "Legal
Matters", rather than bringing
college disciplinary procedures
under scrutiny. "I'm not amused
by it... it was a waste of people's
time." As for the attitude of Prof
New, she said "It's just his way,
he's just like that... college staff
are tactless sometimes."
However, this still leaves
open the issue of what many
consider to be the unnecessary
sarcasm and rudeness on the part
of a hall warden and college pro-
fessor. "I think it typifies the
wardens' views of students" said
Pub board Chair Piers Williams,
"it isn't very responsible to say
things like this."
BY BEN WILKINS
In his column in The Times
last week, Matthew Parris high-
lighted the difficulties faced by
homosexuals at IC because its
students, mainly studying sci-
ence, were more prejudiced than
at other universities.
Parris, the first MP to come
out as gay in a speech to the
House of Commons, recently
visited the college to talk to
Imperial Queers, IC's society for
gay men, lesbians and bisexuals.
Members of IQ complained to
him that their group felt it was
"quite a struggle to be open
about their sexuality at this col-
lege". Their members say they
suffer from a lack of respect and
even arrogance from their fellow
students. On several occasions in
the past when they have put up
posters around college, they have
been torn down. IQ members
envy the "openness of the ethos
in colleges where not all the stu-
dents are studying science".
In his column, Parris reflect-
ed on the fact that scientists on
the whole seem "disproportion-
ately timid and deferential to
conventional wisdom". Scien-
tists, he says, are often perceived
to be rational, objective and free
thinking, belonging to the disci-
pline most likely to challenge
authority and religion. But he
suggested that in reality, scientif-
ic thinking encourages a "narrow
and focussed adherence to one
line of study". He believes it fos-
ters narrowmindedness and rein-
forces ideas about the inferiority
of groups including women, the
mentally ill and homosexuals.
His remarks were criticised
by Sir Walter Bodmer, who has
produced an influential report on
the public understanding of sci-
ence. When he visited Imperial
last week, he commented,
"clearly we still have a long way
to go". The president of Imperial
Queers, Ashley Lumsden, also
disagreed with his reasons for
the prejudice at IC, he said, "I
think because its a science col-
lege, there are are large numbers
of men socialising with other
men. This situation creates a
'macho' atmosphere which does
not lead to much tolerance".
