Dear Rachel,
I must complain in the
strongest possible terms over
your misrepresentation of me in
last week's Felix. I did not say
that ConSoc 'disclaimed' the
views of its chairman, only that
his views were not necessarily
those of ConSoc and more
importantly the views of the
Conservative Party (look in your
glossary of journalistic terms,
this is not the definition of a dis-
claimer, which of course has
wider legal implications). In
effect he was expressing his per-
sonal views and not acting in his
capacity of ConSoc chairman, as
which I believe he still has the
strong support of ConSoc mem-
bers, including myself, to contin-
ue. He should not, I believe have
therefore signed himself as the
ConSoc chairman on the letter in
the same way that MPs and min-
isters when writing to national
newspapers do not include their
titles on letters or articles. As
press officer for ConSoc my pri-
mary concern is to see that party
policy and the interests of
ConSoc as a whole are well and
fairly represented both on the
pages of Felix and elsewhere and
to advise the current member-
ship on how this can best be
done. In so doing I would prefer
to work with Felix rather than
against it in achieving a broad
range of political opinion on its
pages...
Yours,
Mark Summers
What utter twaddle. Although
editorial columns are tradition-
ally a little glib, last week's
'erratum' fell squarely on the
accurate side of opinion. The
'Collins Concise Dictionary'
defines 'disclaim' as "1. to deny
or renounce any claim or con-
nection etc 2. to deny the valid-

Dear Felix,
Congratulations, you've
done it again. Offended so many
members of ConSoc, they all
have to write in and complain.
Maybe they're complaining
because you wrote what Mr
Gummer said, not what the vast
majorities of right wingers pre-
sent thought he said. Still, I
hypothesise, maybe ConSoc
were right and you presented a
massively biased account of the
proceedings. Shame they
weren't organised enough to
send in one complaint, you got
two, so they both had to be edit-
ed. What efficiency.
It also seems that you have
detected a note of discord in
ConSoc. Maybe they are trying
to emulate their party by split-
ting into so many factions it
becomes impossible to credit
each with the same beliefs. On
the other hand, maybe the 'Press
Officer' wishes to replace Mr
Bayley. Just think, your very own
John Redwood.
One final very worrying
thought - IC ConSoc might be
our future leaders. Oh shit1

Maybe I should think about emi-
grating. What - about America,
the only thing politicians argue
about over there is where they
sit on aeroplanes.

H o w about malodious,
Adullamite, inconcinnity, tra-
montate or even abhorrence?
I read with interest Rachel
Walters' editorial last week, with
its call for more left-leaning con-
tribution.
It strikes me that the Labour
party does not need any promo-
tion in college - Messrs Bayley
and Boon of ConSoc are doing a
perfectly good job of it with their
non-stop whinging and petty
bickering. Good work fellas!

I honestly cannot believe
Geoff New's response to the
RCS letter enquiring about disci-
plinary procedure. Now I know
the RCS have been known to be
a little tiresome in their day, but
I am incredulous that someone
appointed to their position so
that they could be responsible
for the pastoral and social wel-
fare of students should respond
to a letter of enquiry with 'Yeah,
I got together with my mates
and we had a jolly good laugh at
your expense.'
I have a certain degree of
sympathy with the question any-
way: during those heady days of
summer last term when people
seemed to get caught smoking
dope on site every few minutes, I
endeavoured to find out what
the college policy on the subject
was. Asking the college registrar,
the senior tutors, security, the
Union, a random selection of
wardens and subwardens and
Belgravia police station what
they would do with a student
found in possession of a joint
gave half a dozen different
replies. But there was broad
agreement that it was 'a difficult
issue' and that we were in need
of a standardised policy on the
subject. They all said then that
they were working on a coherent
statement on the subject over
the summer and would publicise
it in Felix early in the new acad-
emic year. You heard it here
first.

More aggressive than the
Conservatives and better at los-
ing your money than Rag, I am
beginning to get quite fright-
ened. Karl Strugnell, if you're

Â£728 a month on a Ricoh Priport
duplicator. Ever.
Now you know.
