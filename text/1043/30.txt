HOUSING MATTERS
Many enquiries have come
into the advice office con-
cerning housing matters.
Some of the questions most
commonly asked are set out
below. The Union produced
"Housing Rights Guide"
should be available again
from reception very soon.
Q. M y landlord keeps calling
round and letting himself in to
make sure I haven't destroyed
his flat. He lives across the
road and this is annoying me.
What can I do?
A . Your landlord is harrassing
you and this is a criminal
offence. A n implied clause in
any tenancy agreement is that
one is entitled to "quiet enjoy-
ment" of the property. Try
talking to your landlord and i f
that fails, your local tenancy
relations officer should be
able to intervene. Failing that
you could take legal adyice.
Q. I signed a tenancy agree-
ment for a year but I'd like to
move in with some friends.
M y landlord says she will bill
me for the whole of the peri-
od. Is this allowed?
A . A fixed term contract is
supposed to give both parties
a degree of security. Your
landlady could sue for rent
she loses but would have to
show that she has tried to mit-
igate her losses by re-letting
your accomodation first.
Always try and be sure you
want to live somewhere
before you sign an agreement.
Q. M y landlord says I have to
pay him extra i f I have any
friends staying over in my
flat. I have an assured short-
hold tenancy and this isn't in
my agreement. Is it fair?
A . Your landlord may be
concerned that you are going
to 'sub-let' to other people
(i.e. charge someone for
sleeping on your sofa etc).
However, he cannot charge
you for having friends stay
over unless it was part of your
initial agreement. Even i f he
was certain that you were
sub-letting would have to take
legal steps to end the tenancy.
Q. There is a leaking pipe in
my kitchen which has led to
mould and slugs appearing.
M y landlord does not seem
keen to fix it. What can I do?
A . Contact your local envi-
ronmental health office and
ask them to inspect the prop-
erty. They can serve a notice
forcing the landlord to carry
out repairs.
A l l enquiries are dealt with in
strict confidence. The above
scenarios may be familiar to
some but their inclusion does
not refer to specific cases.

THE MONEY PROBLEM
Graduating without amassing
large amounts of debt is virtu-
ally impossible, particularly
for London Students.
Given that rent alone is likely
to eat up your entire student
grant (if you get one), it is
important to budget your
expenditure over the year.
Setting aside part of your
termly income to cover the
essentials (boring things like
rent, food, travel, gas etc.)
will give you a better idea of
what you can and can't afford
to buy.
If you have to take out a
student loan (and are eligi-
ble), take it in termly install-
ments. While the College
would not wish to encourage
students to borrow from any-
where, realistically, student
loans are (apart from free
overdrafts) the most sensible
way to borrow. The interest
rates are low and should you
fail to be employed at the end
of your course, you can defer
repayment.
Also, it is crucial to keep your
bank informed i f you are hav-
ing financial difficulty. Banks
tend to get upset when stu-
dents take it for granted that
spend beyond their limits
without permission. This can
lead to painful bank charges
and withdrawal of some ser-
vices (such as switch cards).
It is basically a question of
good manners and you should
not feel like you are "beg-
ging" your bank for mercy.
They are there to help you
(and to subsequently make
money of course).
Credit cards are to be avoided
at all costs and i f you are cur-
rently propping up a credit
card debt or any other loan
you should consult the Union
adviser on how to go about
reducing the repayments i f
you find yourself in dire hard-
ship. With a little reasonable
negotiation it is sometimes
possible to suspend interest
payments as well (although
you will have to pay the debt
off at some point).
Post-graduate and overseas
students face equally hard
times and often receive little
or no help with their funding.
There is some financial help
available from the college in
the shape of the access and
hardship funds and externally
there are trusts and grant
making bodies who distribute
monies to specific target
groups. A n y students experi-
encing financial difficulties
should contact the Union
Adviser for further informa-
tion. Managing what you
have might still not see you
through to the end of your
course without extra help but
it will certainly make a big
difference.
