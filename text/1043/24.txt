Dear Felix,
At the last Council meeting it
was decided that £300 (a reduc-
tion from £487.03) should be
paid by myself and the Sailing
Club for the repair of several
paintwork scratches on one of the
newer minibuses. As the driver at
the time of the accident, the
Union insurance policy makes me
liable for an excess payment of
£500 on any damage done to the
bus whilst I am responsible for it.
(Incidentally, this includes dam-
age by a third party).
Firstly, the Union staff have
handled the matter badly in every,
respect. The incident occurred in
June. My driver's card has been
on hold ever since. It has taken 5
months (and several meetings) so
far to reach this conclusion which
I am greatly unhappy with.
Secondly, the amount I was
initially expected to pay was not
greatly different from the £500 I
would be charged if I had written
off the bus! The point I was try-
ing to make at the Council was
that, although I accept to pay a
reasonable excess on damage , I
feel that my signature on the bot-
tom of that insurance policy was
taken to mean "IOU £500". No
effort at all was made to keep
repair costs down on my behalf.
I hope that the Union Staff
have learnt a lesson from this one
and make the effort to clear up
future incidents quickly and pro-
fessionally.
Regarding the Union's insur-
ance policy, it seems obvious that
something should be done to pro-
tect Union drivers against the
excess. I urge other concerned
drivers to put pressure on the
Union to make it more sympa-
thetic to those of us that make
club trips possible. Don't wait
until it stings you'

I had no idea that drivers were
personally liable for accidents,
especially third party. Call me a
optimist, but I thought that was
what insurance policies were for.
£487 to repair some scratches?
They could buy new panels for
that. They probably did.

Whilst relaxing in the tranquillity
of Da Vinci's last Friday evening,
in the midst of the usual collection
of student and non-popstar types,
it came to our attention that there
was an intruder among us. The
intruder of which we speak is not
one of the usual brigade of door-
mat thieves or hockey players, but
instead one of the star spangled
pop crowd, who for some reason
had chosen to grace our hallowed
halls. The one and only Jake.
Shillingford, of 'My Life Story'
fame, was downing a merry bevvy
of the Union's best.
At first we thought an
impromptu gig was the order of
the day, only to remember that
the fluffy bunnies had already
played their last gig of the year a
week earlier at the LA2. A gig that
we would like to point out was
chuffing ace.
We would be very grateful if
the powers that be could inform
the world whether or not this is
going to be the start of an amazing
trend of popsters popping in for a
pint on a Friday night or just
Mark's mate making a merry one-
off.
With love,
lake and Mark
Could be. Not only have 'My
Life Story' been seen struggling
through sturdy swathes of
shouting sportsmen, but the
unique Henry Kelly recently
reclined among the rancid rev-
eller's refuse in the reputable Da
Vinci's Bar.
So I'm told.

Dear Felix,
Perhaps it is that the
Blackett Smokers Lobby have
relocated, or maybe mid-term
stresses have become too much,
but I feel that I have been roused
to pop forth my two-penneth
into the smoke pit. It seems that
in the JCR it has become a new
and funky to display ignorance
and disrespect; you can practical-
ly see the two dimensional
thought bubbles reading "Bog off,
if I want a fag I'll 'ave one" float
from one end of the room to the
other. The unfortunate no smok-
ing signs peep dejectedly from
behind last week's posters, hop-
ing beyond hope that someone
might take notice of them.
The final blow occurred
whilst queueing for a vegetable
bargain at the curry bar. Ahead of
me in the queue stood a slovenly,
though not unattractive youth.
He purchased his box in a man-
ner apparently ignorant of com-
mon etiquette, the reason, I char-
itably suggest was the Lambert &
Butler King Size gently nestled
like a new born puppy (beagle,
probably) into the damp corner
of his mouth. The ash had
reached formidable proportions
and threatened to free itself from
the glowing butt to parachute
delicately into the serving trolley
below. If it had not been for my
desperate appetite I fear I may
have passed out.
The point to this IS , though
the JCR is designated a no smok-
ing area there are a growing num-
ber of people who smoke regard-
less. An impromptu headcount
revealed that all these people
could quite happily fit into the
area between the JCR and the
Senior Dining Area. However, as
it seems smokers prefer, quite
rightly, to smoke their own
smoke, they prefer to further
their hobby in places where the
air is clean. But as Dr Bot so vir-
tuously says, they can just bog off
and smoke in the smoking area -
which has a splendid view of QT.
What is to be done? Will the
Union take it in its stride or will
the Dr and I have to speak terse-
ly to those reprobates involved?
Captain Spooner &d Dr Bot
Well there, steady as you go
chaps, not to cast any aspersions
or such like about your persons,
but pertaining to your anhumor-
ous pseudonomic suggestion
(suspicious alliterative?) should
it not read, so to say, 'Dr
Spooner', the stablemate of the
esteemed Mrs Malaprop, or is
this this a case of 'no relation'
eh? I think we should be told,
ramble, etc.

My response to C Unwin's letter
last week regarding student
grants:
Our major competitors ask stu-
dents to pay in full their living
expenses in addition to their fees.
I must emphasise again that it is
the people in the street; the post-
man; the brick layers; the clean-
ers that are helping to pay for our
education. Never forget that we
will become the high earners of
tomorrow- we have a responsibil-
ity to taxpayers, and let's not lose
sight of that for one moment.
Geoff Boon
Vice Chairman of ConSoc
What utter twaddle. 'Major
competitors' do not all expect
students to pay their own way. If
they did, wouldn't that ensure
that university remained elitist
and exclusive? Also, I do not
have a responsibility to any 'tax
payer', except myself and possi-
bly my dad. It is the government
that takes the taxpayers' money
that is responsible for seeing it
used wisely. I hardly think the
taxpayer would accuse the gov-
ernment of wastefully squander-
ing money on education.
Grants are not gifts but
investments. If the government
wants to see able people excel,
then they must allow them the
means to do so. The alternative
is the age old idiocy of educating
the affluent and having a coun-
try run by sheltered out-of-touch
rich fools. Ring any bells?
