christmas
carnival
Well, you may as well get your
Christmas plans sorted early. A n d it
is only a fortnight until the end of
term, so we thought we'd share
what's in Santa's Grotto, ents wise.
After much deliberation (and not a
little sulking) we've finally
confirmed everything that will be
going on on Friday 15th December.
The I C U C H R I S T M A S
C A R N I V A L k1 C ks off at 9pm &
runs until 3am, with a 2am bar
(subject to licence).
Weather permitting, the Quad
will contain a coconut shy, bash-
the-rat, fun fair darts game &
gyroscope. In the Ents Lounge
we've got live entertainment from
an eight piece Steel Band, & Stevie
Starr - the Regurgitator - an act
definitely not for the squeamish!
The first act is on stage at 10pm.
After the acts we've got the return
of Pop Tarts DJs, so if you're into
indie, 70s & 80s pop, & party tack,
this is the room for you.
U D H plays home to "Sex on
The Beach", which promises 6
hours of the coolest swing, funk, hip
hop, soul & jungle for all you
rumpshakers. On the second floor
there's the ski stimulator, and the
Concert Hall will be transformed
into a banging club venue with in -
your - face tunes, a 3 colour laser,
dance platforms & top light show.
The whole venue will look nothing
like you've ever seen it before, with
drapes, banners & lighting giving it a
whole new look. This promises to
be a very different experience to
any you've previously had at IC.
Tickets are on sale now, £6 or
£5 if you're clever enough to have
brought an Entscard, but buy soon
'cos we guarantee a sell out. All of
this festive jollity is brought to you
with the kind assistance of STA
Travel, based on the Sherfield
Walkway.
