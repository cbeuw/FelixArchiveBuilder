The Union now has a legal
advice scheme operating on
Wednesday evenings between
5 and 6pm. The visiting
solicitors are specialists in
either housing or immigra-
tion. The service is available
to students and staff. Those
who are eligible for legal aid
(on grounds of low income)
will be asked to sign a legal
aid green form. If you are not
eligible for legal aid you will
still be given free advice.
Any subsequent legal work
required will not be provided
free unless you qualify for
legal aid.
The session operates on a
'first-come, first served'
basis. You are recommended
to check in before 5pm as
only a limited number of peo-
ple can be seen. If you want
to find out who is attending in
a specific week or require fur-
ther details, please contact the
Union Adviser.
Recent tragedies concerning
ecstacy, the "love drug" have
proved it to be potentially as
lethal as any other. Many
known problems stem from
impurities (and even poisons)
being mixed with the pure
drug in order to save money
for the supplier. Added to this
are risks of overheating
INTERNATIONAL
STUDENTS & COUNCIL
TAX
International students are
reminded that if they are cur-
rently paying 75% council tax
because their non-British
spouse has joined them, they
may be eligible for full
exemption following a
change in the regulations
recently. If a non-EEA
spouse is either prohibited
from working or forbidden to
claim public funds, then the
exemtion may apply. Contact
the Union Adviser for further
details.
STUDENTS &
COUNCIL TAX
Students who share accomo-
dation with non-students may
find themselves jointly and
severally liable for council
tax. For example, 3 students
living with 1 non-student
would each be responsible for
caused by dehydration and
other adverse reactions to tak-
ing the drug, the causes of
which are not yet fully under-
stood. Taken over the longer
term, it is thought that it may
lead to psychological depen-
dance and possible physical
and neurological damage.
making sure that someone
pays 75% of the full bill.
They Would get a 25%
discount as only one non-
exempted person lives there.
Also, students living in par-
ticular types of housing may
also have to pay council tax
via their rent (as the landlord
will be charged directly).
Anyone moving into different
accomodation should find out
what their council tax
situation is before they do so.
INTERNATIONAL
STUDENTS & CHILD
BENEFIT
International students with
children are reminded that
they can and should claim
child benefit and help with
NHS charges. Child benefit is
not regarded as 'recourse to
public funds'.
Ecstacy is a class A drug so
manufacture, possession and
supply is illegal. It is also
illegal t o d r i v e under
its influence. Anyone needing
advice or counselling on any
drug-related matter should
contact Release on 0171 603
8654.
