dram soc
Strange things are afoot at Dramsoc.
Rumours of flying snakes and sinister
sheep abound, while some of the
societies more flighty members were
spotted in the throws of orgasmic
delirium - and this outside the
confines of any of our noble bars, the
more usual venues for such
indulgence.
It seems the explanation for all
this is Arthur Miller's "The Creation
of the World and Any Other
Business". His only musical is an epic
and colourful re-presentation of the
creation myth. Adapted for the
straight theatre Miller delights in the
idea of modern man existing in a
world of mythical wonder: G o d
charmingly paternal, Lucifer a loving
and analytical child, and Adam
supremely ignorant and infinitely
trusting.
Out of love Eve is conceived and
with her doubt and desire are
introduced.To discover what "other
business" occurs, come and see "The
Creation..." in the Union Concert
Hall, from Monday 3rd December
(see diary for details).
Imagine being locked in a room
with no windows and no mirrors; a
room where the lights are always on
and no matter how tired you get,
you'll never be able to sleep. Imagine
sharing this room with two other
people; there is nowhere to hide,
they see everything you do, hear your
every sound...in time they will know
you better than you know yourself.
Every dirty, guilty secret; every
regret you've ever had. A n d this will
go on for ever, not even death will
allow you to escape...because you're
already dead. Sound like hell? It is;
the hell of Jean-Paul Sartre's "In
Camera", Dramsoc's second play this
term.
Admission is free (see diary for
dates) so please join us for an evening
of intense and thought-provoking
drama.
