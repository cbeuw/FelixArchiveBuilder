Felix
Editorial
C h i n a
It would difficult in this editorial to condemn the Beijing massacre without
being accused of jumping on to the rickety bandwaggon of instant concern
which politicians and student unions love to wheel out in moments of
tragedy.
The reports from China are disturbing: the Government is in disarray,
the army is split and there are rumours of impending civil war. Three
thousand people have been killed, shot or crushed beneath the wheels
of the 27th Army's tanks. Students have been shot in their beds at
university halls of residence, their bodies piled up outside and burnt as
the army fruitlessly tried to destroy the evidence.
London's student Unions, not least amongst them, Imperial College
Union, have moved quickly to organise protests designed to cajole the
British Government into more concrete protestations. Perhaps news of
British support will filter through to students in China. But the reality lies
thousands of miles away and no matter how vehemently we express our
concern, or how vigourously politicians reproduce their stock expressions
of condemnation, there is very little that the supporters of Chinese
democracy can do other than to watch and wait.
Staff P h o t o g r a p h
Anyone who has contributed to FELIX this year should meet at 12.30pm
in the FELIX office next Friday for the staff photograph.
F E L I X M o t o r Rally
This year's FELIX motor rally will take place on Saturday June 17. We
are looking for people to make up teams for the rally, which will take the
form of a wacky treasure hunt. I am assured that every entrant is
guaranteed a prize (did someone mention alcohol?) with stupendous prizes
for the winning team. Teams can be a maximum of four people, but don't
worry if you haven't got a car, bicycle, or rollerskates etc. Entry is £5
per team. Call into the office for more details. Registration is at 10am on
the day in the FELIX Office.
E n d o f term issue
There will be no FELIX next Friday, but instead, there will be a special
end of term issue on Wednesday 21 st June. There will be a collation party
starting Tuesday lunchtime. Feel free to drop in for fun and frolicks. On
Wednesday evening there will be a champagne buffet for members of
FELIX staff. Please sign the list in the office if you can make it.
