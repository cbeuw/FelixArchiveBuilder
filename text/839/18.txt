Students find HUB
Office Three students from IC Caving
Club, sponsored by the Exploration
Board, have succeeded in locating
the H U B Office. The mystical office
was believed to be somewhere in
the Sherfield Building, but after two
weeks of extensive searching the
team had found nothing. Finally,
after asking some natives, they
treked 200 yards towards Queens
Gate, and traced the office to the
Rector's bedroom. Previous reports
that the H U B Office promotes
'social' intercourse between
students are now thought to be
misprints.
QT burgers in chemical
weapons controversy
Hamburgers from the QT burger bar
have been cited as evidence of U K
stockpiling of chemical weapons qt
the Geneva Arms Talks this week.
Russian negotiators said, 'We firmly
believe that Imperial College is
testing out these vile weapons on
unsuspecting students before the
government deploys them in West
Germany.'
A spokesman for IC refrectories
denied the allegations, but added
that it sounded like a jolly good
idea, and sales might pay for the
new lighting i n the Main Dining
Hall.
ICU Staircase Collapse
Carnage
Staff arriving at the Union Building yesterday were surprised to find the
main staircase missing. The staircase was apparently needed by Sherfield
to provide the Rector with a 'back door' escape route from his office.
Mountaineering. Club had to be contacted to provide climbing gear to
get the Sabbaticals up to the Union Office. However, at about 10am, a large
section of the building, weakened by the alterations, collapsed into the
games room, seriously injuring I C U D P Chas Brereton. T was really pissed
off, said Chas, speaking from his hospital bed. T had just got to the final
level of Operation Wolf.'
