WEMBLEYNEWEXHIBITIONHALL
BRINGING YOUR FUTURE
TO YOU!
CAREERS '89 offers you the opportunity to interview your future employers!
Between 12 and 15 October 1989 Wembley's New Exhibition Hall plays host to the first in what
will become the biggest annual recruitment event in the UK.
The NEW BUSINESS IDEA OF THE YEAR competition winner will be announced on the last day
of CAREERS '89 where the prize of Â£20,000 start-up capital will be presented.
And CAREERS' 89 will be the centre where a wide and comprehensive range of companies,
institutions and professions gather to meet you.
You, whether a graduate (of up to 3 years standing), undergraduate or school-leaver need to
know more about the various facets of commerce and industry - before you commit yourself.
CAREERS '89 is the one place to visit - to find out what you really want - and how to get it.
