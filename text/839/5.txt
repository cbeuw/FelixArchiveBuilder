Heroes hi Beijing
An opinion by Shen Ning
China
The last w e e k e n d has seen
u n p r o v o k e d indiscriminate
murdering of students, workers and
other innocents on the streets of
Beijing, the full horror of which has
only just been touched upon by the
newspapers and television. The
army is still firing at people on the
streets and Beijing is now a killing
field. The behaviour of the Chinese
government and army is not only an
offense to our beliefs in democracy
but also totally inhumane.
As a group of British and overseas
research students we feel that we
along with all students at IC need
to act now in support of our fellow
Chinese students and the Chinese
people. We understand that we
should not interfere with the
political struggle within the Chinese
government. But we must express
our strongest condemnation to the
Chinese government for the killings
of the peaceful student
demonstrators and innocent people
passing the street.
In order to know more about the
events happening in China we
interviewed S h e n N i n g , the
s p o k e s m a n for the Chinese
Students and Scholars Association
in the U K , w h o is one of the
organizers of the recent protesting
marches and demonstrations in the
city of London.
Q: I know that you come from Beijing
yourself but who are the people that
CSSA represents?
SN: CSSA is the organisation for
students from the People's
Republic of China, which stands
for Chinese Students and Scholars
Association. It has branches in
universities throughout the world.
The majority of members of CSSA
(UK) are sponsored by the Chinese
government or the British Council.
There are about 150 Chinese
students and academic visitors in
Imperial College at the moment.
Q: What are the feelings among the
Chinese students in UK about the
killings in Beijing?
SN: Everybody is greatly shocked
and deeply mourning. Many of us
couldn't believe the blood-bath we
saw in T A M Square on T V . This
fascist activity is the greatest crime
in China's modern history. We
denounce the Li Peng government
and strongly condemn the
government's slaughter of innocent
students and people.
Q: Have you been able to contact your
family in China? What is their response?
SN: Yes. I called my family in
Beijing several times in the past few
weeks but in recent days I could not
get through. Some friends of mine,
however, did manage to call their
family in Beijing as well as in other
cities. The people in Beijing were
in shock and in great fear for the
massacre. But people in other cities
do not fully realise what's
happened in Beijing since the state
controlled media tell lies. The truth
is gradually spreading over the
whole country and demonstrations
and workers' strikes are seen in
many cities.
Q: Under the current circumstances,
what action can you take here?
SN: The most important thing at
the moment is to stop the army
killing the people. We have
protested against the Chinese
government's repression of its
people by organising
demonstration marches and rallies.
More than five thousand people
joined the march on 21 May when
martial law was declared and many
thousands marched to the Chinese
embassy last Sunday to protest
against the killing. We have
appealed to the British government
and the general public to show their
support to the students in China
and to condemn more strongly the
present Chinese government's
barbarism. We are calling the
whole world to take every possible
action against the Chinese
government. We also realise that it
is critically important to let all
people in China know the truth. We
have been sending material that
describes what's happening in
Beijing to many people in China by
FAX and letters. We believe if the
people in other parts of China
know the truth of Beijing's
massacre, they will unite and fight
against the government. We ask for
generous donations for those died
and injured .
Q: As students in a western country,
we are deeply inspired by the courage of
the Chinese students that they are
risking their lives for demands of
democracy. From your point of view,
Shen Ning, the leader of CSSA in IC and the spokesman of CSSA
UK, is doing postdoctorial research in the Physics Department.
what is the best way that we can help
Chinese people? ,
SN: I appreciate the concern and
the moral support of students here.
I think it would be most helpful if
British students and the public
could press the British government
to take tougher measures against
the Chinese government. I was glad
to see that many IC students and
staff have signed the petition
demanding further government
action on Wednesday. Also writing
to MP's or other cabinet ministers
will help.
Q: There are reports about the possible
split in the Chinese army. Is there any
possibility of a civil war in China?
SN: It would be encouraging if
these reports have been confirmed.
However, it is certain that army
leaders are divided on the way the
demonstrators should be dealt
with. It is too early to suggest that
a civil war could happen; I would
be inclined to see a military coup
against the hard liners.
Q: Suppose Li Peng and the hard-liners
hold their power with the help of troops
\this time, Do you think it will lead to
massive arrests and execution of
demonstrators?
SN: That would definitely be the
consequence and China would
enter its darkest era. Student
leaders and intellectuals are the first
to be purged. But even if it
happened I am sure that they would
not last long and a bigger and more
powerful revolution would soon
overthrow a fascist government
such as the one now in China.
Death on the streets.
