Hell of a
row
The College is planning to install a
new £40,000 P A system in the Great
H a l l to i m p r o v e its use for
conferences. With the new system,
'We could have a hell of a lot more
lettings than there are at present,'
claims the Rector, Professor Eric
Ash.
The cost of the system will be met
by the IC Trust (formerly the
Queensgate Trust) and the College's
Conference Office. The College
hopes to install the new P A over the
Summer. There are also plans to
improve the lighting and acoustics
of the Hall in the future, although
these are not firm.
The Rector told FELIX that there
have been complaints about the
poor standard of the Great Hall for
20 years, which he felt were
highlighted by the poor sound
quality at this year's 'Ways out of
the Arms Race' conference. H e
added that he would like to see an
i m p r o v e m e n t i n the H a l l ' s
s o u n d p r o o f i n g to prevent
disturbances to students in Reid and
Pippard Lecture Theatres.

his death. He was also President of
Imperial College's 'Friends of
Palestine' Society.
Despite his short life he achieved
much and contributed significantly
to the lives of all who knew him.
Louai was an ambitious, honest and
straightforward young man, full of
energy and the joy of life.
He is survived by his parents, a

Welfare
money
Next year's Welfare Officer is to be
paid for 10 weeks over the Summer
Holiday to produce a new Welfare
Handbook and plan a set of welfare
campaigns. Union President, Nigel
Baker told FELIX that the Officer
will also receive training from
Welfare Adviser Yve Posner.
The cost of the venture will be met
by funds from the Union's Finance
C o m m i t t e e , left over from
unclaimed and over-estimated Five
Year plans. Next Year's Welfare
Officer will be elected at the Union's
Annual General Meeting on June
20. Jackie Scott and Alastair Goodall
are currently standing for the
position.
Top-up
loans
knocked
down
A report in The Guardian this week
claimed that the Government's
plans for top up loans for students
have been opposed by more than
100 of the organisations consulted.
Ministers have refused to publish
the 142 formal responses to the
White Paper. The article claims that
64% of universities support a grants
system whilst the remainder
support a graduate tax. T h e
legislative plans for top up loans are
expected to be announced i n
November's Queen's speech.
UGM election shocks
In a surprise decisiori"bjt'last week's
Union General Meeting, Rory Curtis
has been returned as next year's
Haldane Record buyer.
M r Curtis, the only candidate
standing for the post told FELIX
yesterday that he was 'shocked and
stunned' by the decision.
Tt was like a bolt from the blue'
he said
In the same meeting, onlookers
could hardly contain their
excitement when Alistair Goodall
was elected as president I C
C o m m u n i t y A c t i o n G r o u p
( I C C A G ) , M a r t i n Gans as
Postgraduate Affairs Officer,
M u r r a y W i l l i a m s o n as House
Committee C h a i r m a n , A t h o s
Ritsperis as Academic Affairs Officer
and Clare Towner as Silwood Park
Chair.
The meeting was not without its
disapointments.. M a x Kallios,
standing as U G M chair was said to
have been devasted when he was
beaten b y ' n e w election' a n d
E m m a n u a l Saradakis (shurley
shome mishtake—Ed), standing for
the post of Welfare Officer stormed
out of the door in floods of tears
when he too was defeated by 'new
election.'
Later, in a surprise move from the
floor, Chris Brown, Steve Farrant
and Joe Fearnley were returned as
members of the External Affairs
Committee and delegates to the
University of L o n d o n General
Union Council despite hurls of
abuse and rotten cabbages from the
audience.
T was quite surprised by the
results' said Union President Nigel
Baker 'next year should be an
interesting year for the Union.'
Black & White
The meeting of Imperial College
Union Social Clubs Committee has
refused all nominations from the
Major Sub Committees (MSC) on
the grounds that the M S C ' s , which
represent clubs, societies a n d
publications have their own systems
of colours.
Amongst the nominations refused
were those on behalf of Athletics
Clubs Committee and Social Clubs
Committee, and Publications Board,
a l t h o u g h a n o m i n t a i o n w a s
accepted on behalf of S C A B .
Felix Says
The Unions decision not to award
Social Colours to members of the
Major Sub-committees (MSCs) is
exactly the sort of decision that I
have come to expect from the
narrow m i n d e d w*nkers w h o
inhabit the Union Office. It would
be asking too much to expect the
Union Officers to appreciate the fact
that the M S C ' s contribute more in
one day to the life of the average
student at Imperial than the Union
Officers do in one year.
Practically every student is a
member of one or more clubs o r
societies. Surely, the hard work put
in by members of the M S C , which
benefits so many students should be
recognised by the Union in the form
of Union Social Colours?
It comes down, of course to the!
misapprehension by Union Officers
(who so incestuously a w a r d
themselves and their cronies colours
at the drop of a hat) that they are the
Union.
B*U*cks! As I have said before, the
Union is made up of every student
at Imperial College and it is about
time the Union office recognised this
fact and gave those people w h o
have put so much contribution to
life at Imperial the recognition they
deserve.
Jelly Jelly he's
our mate, we all
think he's really
great.
Happy 23rd
