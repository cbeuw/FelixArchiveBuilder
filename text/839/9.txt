Hamlet
National Theatre (Olivier)
H a m l e t is Shakespeare's
masterpiece. The most emotionally
and intellectually engrossing of
plays, it deals with the individual's
search for a purpose and an identity,
the angst associated with youth, the
uncertainties of the mind, the
exploration of morality and the
yearning for motivation and resolve.
All this is expressed through the
central character Hamlet, the Black
Prince.
Richard Eyre's production at the
National is everything the play
should be—spectacular, sinister,
intelligent and mysterious. We look
upon a majestic sprawling set. Large
walls, representing the castle
corridors, fold away revealing the
voluminous recesses of the threatre,
a courtyard with a massive statue of
the late King of Denmark, behind
which his ghost walks amidst
billowing clouds of smoke.
The costumes of the court are
colourful and ostentatious, but at
the same time the mood is sombre
enough to give a credible
atmosphere i n which Hamlet can
deliver his five soliloques.
The play is foremost about
revenge. Hamlet is a young prince
summoned by the ghost of his
father, the late King, to avenge his
murder by his brother Claudius,
who now reigns with the Prince's
mother Gertrude as Queen. The
great part of the play deals with
Hamlet's efforts to do this. H e
swings between indecision a n d
resolve, fiercely rebukes his mother,
Clara s Heart

Clara's Heart marks W h o o p i e
Goldberg's return to serious films.
After her last dramatic role as Celie
in Spielberg's The Colour Purple, she
made a series of third rate 'nothing'
movies that only served as vehicles
to propel her into obscurity.
Clara's Heart focuses o n the
relationship that develops between
Clara Mayfield (Whoopie Goldberg)
and David, a precocious, angst-
ridden kid (Neil Patrick Hams).
Clara is a know-it-all, seen-it-all
Jamaican woman hiding a deep dark
secret, which the film withholds
from us until we've lost interest and
don't really want to know anymore.
David is just a bullied teenager who
can't pick up girls. A t first he resents
the i n t r u s i o n of the n e w
housekeeper Clara, but when his
parents begin to break up after the
death of a baby daughter, it is only
Clara that gives him the attention
and guidance that he needs.
The film starts well enough will

more and more monotonous, the
plot becomes more a n d more
tedious and the kid becomes more
and more unbearable.
Each scene is s w a m p e d i n
sentimentality that would make any
sane person nauseous. It is
obviously supposed to be a tear
jerker, but by the end one is just fed
up of the barrage of oversentimental
codswallop and dire piano musak.
It's like sitting through two hours of
elevator music.
You would have thought that
Hollywood would have grown out
of making such schmaltzy crap like
this, but someone somewhere
thinks that to make a tear jerker, one
has to patronise the audience in a
very conceivable way. Avoid.

In the end, Claudius plots for

The
Double-Bass
The Man in the Moon Theatre, 392
King's Road.
This two act monologue by Patrick
Suskin explores a day in the life of
a professional double-bass player.
He paces around his apartment
apparently too bored to practice his
instrument a n d , i n the good
company of a bottle of wine,
proceeds to reveal his thoughts on
all matters musical.
The double-bass not only
dominates the rather spartan set
but, as the title implies, occupies our
musicians mind for much of the
play. The two have a curious
relationship. He first passionately
argues his case that the instrument
is the most important of those in the
orchestra. Suddenly1
his position
changes and he launches into a
frenzied denigration of the bass's
attributes by exposing the 'buzzing
tone' that even he, third bassist in
the National Orchestra, can never
a very impressive actor indeed. M y
initial uncertaintly about him in the
role dissolved as the many layers of
Hamlet's character emerged. H i s
deep brooding brow gives h i m a
powerful presence and the way he
feigns insanity for sanity's sake is
deftly handled.
O n e always identifies w i t h
Hamlet. He is the focus of all our
uncertainties. His anguished and
painstaking deliberations seat at the
soul. The most famous soliloquy
ever, 'To be or not to be...' spoken
when he considers taking his own
life, expresses the agonising
indecision that is a part of his
nature, and it is performed with
such passion by Day-Lewis that it
almost brings a tear to the eye.
He is given excellent support by
Michael Bryant as Polonius, the
father of Ophelia, and John Castle
as Claudius, but Judi Dench makes
a diffident Gertrude.
At 3% hours, the play is extremely
long (the first half alone is nearly 2%
hours). However, I found myself
enthralled by the set, the acting and
the power of the play. A s C S Lewis
said of Hamlet—he is a 'man whose
words make US' at once think of
loneliness and doubt and dread, of
waste and dust and emptiness, and
from whose hands as from our own,
we feel the richness of heaven and
earth and the comfort of human
affection slipping away.' It's a great
play—don't miss it.
Hamlet continues at the National
Theatre through to August.

improve upon.
The other main focus of his
attention is Sarah, a young soprano
in the National Opera. During much
of the second half he relates tales of
his attempts to be noticed by her.
H o w e v e r , he is also actively
planning a final outrageous act
which will surely imprint his image
on her brain forever! The seeming
impossibility of their meeting is
matched by the gulf between the
highest pitched voice and the lowest
sounding instrument.
Ron Berglas gives a fully
convincing performance . o f the
neurotic m u s i c i a n alternating
between dark dispair and intense
passion. H e is supported by a
wonderful script of extremely funny
anecdotes and vitriolic observations.
If your preconceived notion of a
monologue is that of an actor
droning on about some boring topic
then take a trip to the M a n in the
Moon Theatre. Be prepared for a
surprise.
