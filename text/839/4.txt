It's that time of vear again. You've
got your pen in your hand and
butterflies in your stomach and
you're looking at a piece of paper.
'Answer three out of the following
six questions', it orders.
You leaf slowly through the
questions: 'possible... didn't revise
that bit... or that bit... that one's
O.K.'. You calm down a little: you're
in the right room, doing the right
exam. There's even an off-chance
that the lecturer bothered to read his
course notes before writing the
questions.
You look for the gift question.
Everybody knows that there's
always a gift question: lecturers get
very depressed if everyone fails
their course; it's like a kick in the
professorial ego. You continue to
look. Question one... no, two... not
really, three, four, five... no way,
six... doesn't look like it. Y o u seem,
to have been taught by the only
academic who wears ego protectors.
It's always a bad start to an exam if
you have to think.
No gift, so you attack the question
you revised for. It takes three
quarters of an hour, ten minutes
longer than you allowed. You check
it over...seems correct. It's almost a
shock to realise you understood part
of your course. You suppress a silly
grin.
Next question. Seems quite easy
at first, you trot quickly through the
first half until suddenly you hit IT.
Exhausted marathon runners hit
what they call 'The Wall', when
their legs give way and the ground
jumps up and attacks. You've just
found its academic equivalent. A
mental alarm bell goes off. A little
voice in your head starts shouting
abuse at you: 'Whose bloody silly
idea was it to do this question
anyway?' it whines. Whoever it is
inside your head is not going to let
you live that one down.
You look up. A l l around you
people are writing. 'Well, they
know the answers!' nags your
tormentor. Y o u polish off half the
packet of P O L O s that you left lying
on your desk and start playing with
your calculator. One plus one equals
two, plus one equals three, square
rooted gives a number you think
you should recognise.
'I'm sure 1.73...something is a
fascinating number,' interrupts your
conscience,' but haven't you got an
exam to do.' That's the annoying
thing about consciences: they may
be right but they aren't half
irritating. You straighten up, shake
your head and put your brain back
into gear. You mentally rev up for
the next question. It's as if you start
to hear the Grand Prix theme
playing in the background.
A n imaginary Murray Walker
natters away at the back of your
m i n d . ' A n d they're off. It's
Examinee as he winds his way past
the first proof and, yes, he's made
it. He takes the waffle answer at full
speed. A n d he's through. Put in the
values. Easy. The atmosphere here
is electric, and yes, as he turns the
final corner through the practical
applications he's on to the home
straight. Nothing can stop him now.
The question is as good as over!
A n d . . . disaster!. He's crashed on
the final section. This is terrible,
catastrophic' You splutter to the end
of the question with ten minutes to
spare.
What do you do in ten minutes?
Obvious, try the second question
again. Staring at it doesn't help.
Scrawl a few notes. Still nothing and
there's just two minutes to go.
Suddenly it clicks. That's how its
done. Bloody obvious. You pick up
your pen and... 'Time u p ' smirks
the invigilator.
Your papers are collected. You
pick up your pens and leave the
room. A l l around you everyone
looks equally depressed. You're all
in the same boat. Unfortunately it's
half way up Shit Creek and
someone's just lost the paddle.
