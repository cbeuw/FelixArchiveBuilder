have to fit in.
This attitude is seen in the College
hierarchy. A t a time when alumni
are being tapped for money and
interest in Imperial, up comes a
proposal for merger with R H B N C
and a complete change in the nature
of IC. A l l this is promoted by
perceived harsh economic realities,
but is considered sacrilege by those
who have gone before, prompting
petitions in College, and a large
quantity of mail from irate alumni.
I consider it insensitive at the very
least.
What of Imperial College Union?
Faced with a College that is less and
less willing or able to consider the
needs of students, from funding of
the Union to the simple provision of
decent cheap roofs over their heads,
what have they done?
When I arrived at College, IC
Union had probably the last of the
'student' executives. The Union
structure was rapidly heading
towards the professional money
making attitude it has now, where
all seems devoted to running profit
making outlets, and little towards
personal contact with students.
Christine Taig still ran a Union
w h i c h was controlled by the
sabbaticals and aided by the
permanent staff who did most of the
d o n k e y w o r k and p r o v i d e d
continuity from year to year. N o w
we have handed our birthright over
to paid U n i o n managers and
accountants. Although I realise that
the fact that the Union has taken
over the running of these outlets
means that these people are needed
to keep things going, I wonder
whether we have lost much of the
feeling of a 'students' Union in the
process. The sabbaticals are more
and more concerned with running
this side of things, and ensuring the
money rolls in, and less with getting
down and meeting students and
actually listening to them. Students
should be getting a good deal out of
the Union. If they were, the Snack
Bar and Union Bar would be packed
every night. They are not.
Much of this is due to the
sabbaticals we elect. In my three
years at College, the only President
I have seen with the force of
personality to achieve what he set
out to do is Sydney Harbour-Bridge.
I dislike many of the changes he
brought about last year, but at least
he had the strength of character and
the guts to get what he wanted
done, and stand up to College.
Christine Taig did not set out to
change the world, so the world was
not changed. She was honest and
accountable and the Union was seen
to act for students. Sydney Harbour-
Bridge went all out to kick arse and
change things. They changed
dramatically. He always asked the
opinion of the students, and he
Is Imperial dying by degrees?.
Dave Burns takes a look.
N i g e l D . Baker: S o d the rest of the w o r l d ?
represented those opinions well.
Nigel Baker set out to do what Nigel
Baker wanted done, and sod the rest
of the world. Fair's fair, he's worked
hard, but he has schemed and
intrigued his way through the year.
The atmosphere in the Union seems
to me strained and unwelcoming.
Students are not informed of what
is going on through the pages of
FELIX because sabbaticals have
become locked in petty personality
clashes. The depressing catalogue
continues.
By now you're probably thinking,
'Yeah, w h y aren't they doing
enough for me?' The sad fact is that
the student body is as apathetic as
the politics in the Union Office is
Machiavellian. Clubs are healthy,
true e n o u g h , but few seem
interested in putting in the hard
work required to run I C U and the
CCUs on a day-to-day basis. As long
as the subvention from I C U turns
up, then people are happy. They
seem happy to play sport once a
week and get on with their courses.
There is a lot more to a student
union than just participating in your
little but and forgetting that your
help might be appreciated in other
areas. Rag, Ents, Academic Affairs,
the numerous committees all need
a high level of student input. A t the
moment most of these activities are
supported by a dedicated few. (For
example: R C S Rag's Â£18,000 Rag
total has been raised by a group of
about twenty 'hacks'.) Students
appear massively introverted and
unconcerned with anything outside
their sphere of friends. College
encourages Hall entertainments
with amenities subventions, so
people become wrapped up in a
limited area and never need emerge
from their place of residence. It is
eminently possible to arrive at
Imperial and never emerge from
your dwelling for anything other
than lectures. What a marvellous
time they must have at College. For
three years you can experience the
company of a limited number* of
people and really get to know about
life! A friend of mine recently gazed
around the Physics leaving party
and commented, ' G o d , what a
group of social spastics.' A n extreme
view, but one with a good basis in
fact. If, after three years in College,
people are leaving untouched in
anything other than their ability to
absorb dry facts, then Imperial is
failing miserably as a university.
M y worst nightmare is that
Imperial should become just another
university. It has a brilliant history,
a brilliant academic tradition, some
of the most talented minds in the
country, a n d i n the past a
wonderfully committed student
population who made it a pleasure
to go to IC. With increasing apathy,
the rising cost of actually living here,
and College's lack of appreciation of
the needs of students, and the
contribution which students can
make, the slide into mediocrity can
only continue. IC needs the best. It
should actively seek out and select
the best.
As for my own feelings on leaving
Imperial, I can only conclude by
saying I have fallen in love with the
place, warts and all. I have probably
got a reasonable degree out of my
time here, and made scores of
friends. I have had the opportunity
to meet people from over 65 years
of IC's history, and actively
participated in many aspects of the
Students' Union. M y course is one
of the easier at Imperial, so maybe
I have had more time than many,
but I doubt it. A s a sponsored
student all my vacations have been
spent away from the U K , with little
opportunity to cram in work I had
not done in term time. I have
thoroughly enjoyed every minute of
it. I only hope that in the future the
powers that be will get their heads
banged together, and people will
begin to appreciate that Imperial is
a very special place. However, you
can't just sit on your backside and
hope that IC will continue to remain
vital. This is something which
requires as much work as it takes to
get a degree.
It will only happen if you make it
happen!
