"So long. Â«
and thanks for all the beer
Once upon a time, there was a
fresher who sat in the Rector's
reception for the 1986/87 session of
Imperial College. He was bored stiff.
The Rector told him to go out once
or twice to the theatre, get involved
in a club (singular), and not to get
stuck in some ' G o d foresaken
factory in the North'. The fresher
went to sleep after that.
Three years later, and I am about
to graduate from this hallowed
shrine of academia. I have seen
enormous changes in three years at
IC, changes which I find depressing
and have prompted me to outline
what I see as the writing on the wall
for Imperial College, as something
special in the world of higher
education.
S y d n e y H a r b o u r - B r i d g e has
already written at length in the
pages of FELIX on the academic
climate at Imperial and I agree with
nearly all of what he has said.
Imperial College's role is to produce
scientists and engineers for
industry. It is arguable as to whether
or not it is doing this as, although
I can see so many going into the
world of finance after their degrees,
I would not consider my o w n
experience to be wide enough to
extend this to all those leaving
Imperial. However, it would be fau-
to say that a disproportionate
number of graduates are entering
fields other-than those covered by
their degrees, or remaining in the
ivory towers of academia.
This is not what concerns me the
most though. A s well as producing
highly educated scientists and
the places on courses are filled by
somebody, anybody. Say what you
like about Oxbridge, at least their
elitist attitude towards entry
requirements means that there is
actually competition to get into the
place. It implies that Oxbridge is
something special. If you attend an
interview with a group of people,
and the only selection process is
being sat down in a group, chatted
to for 15 minutes, told that you're
all being offered two C's, the
impression is hardly one of an
establishment which is taking an
interest as you as a person. Anyone
who thinks that they can determine
whether or not a candidate will
make a contribution to college in all
areas purely on the basis of their
U C C A form is entirely deluded. Yet
this is what Imperial seems to
believe is the best way of selecting
the people who are effectively going
to represent the College after their
degrees, and in theory keep the
candidates coming in when they
have left.
If, as I believe, Imperial is a unique
institution, worthy of its reputation
for excellence, should this not be
reflected in the care with which it
chooses its students? You wouldn't
believe it from the lackadaisical
attitude they currently have on
admissions. Surely there should be
some effort to filter a balance into
the system. We need the best
academics, but we also need the
sportsmen, the sociafisers, the
doers, the people who are going to
make the place a community which
will attract the best, and turn out the
sort of people industry needs. When
a student is admitted to Imperial
there s h o u l d be a symbiotic
relationship. Imperial should give a
full and relevant education for
which they get a student who will
be a credit to the academic
reputation of the College, and the
student should be able to enjoy all
the aspects of life which will make
them a full and mature individual.
Were Imperial to admit only those
guaranteed to disappear for three or
four years, emerge after this period
to sail off with a first, and be none
the better for it as a person, then we
would very rapidly have bugger-all
reputation.
Student life, College's attitude
towards their students and the
Students' Union itself, have all
changed markedly during my time
u t College, following trends which
have their roots firmly embedded in
the current political climate and
those in charge of Imperial.
The first person people meet at
Imperial, and the person ultimately
responsible for all that is Imperial,
is the Rector. I find Eric Ash's
attitude towards the student
populace sadly l a c k i n g . H i s
reception speech, which must be
lodged in some sort of unerasable
mental R O M , is hardly guaranteed
to set the neurones of new student
firing w i t h enthusiasm and
anticipation. It seems that he
believes students should be the
guardians of the odd Victorian
values of scientist as artist, spending
time expending their minds onto
higher artistic plains, visiting
museums, the theatre, art galleries
and the like. If, in addition they are
good at rowing, all the better. Work
hard, and occasionally get out there
and enjoy a few of the delights of
London, this is the message.
He sadly passes by the traditions
of Imperial which make is so
unique. Imperial is a strange
assortment of genius in all spheres,
oddly planted i n one of the
wealthiest areas of London. It
should be a community just as a
campus university is. W h y doesn't
he emphasise student activity
around College? W h y no plug for
the Union? Maybe he just doesn't
have a feel for the place. There are
so many people with talents outside
their academic courses who seem to
receive little encouragement from
the top. The Rector has declined to
write items for FELIX this year, he
is rarely seen d o w n with the
'troops', he seems reluctant to make
contact with the very people who he
is relying on to make the reputation
of Imperial. This is not some sort of
glorified Grammar School, it is a
place where people come to achieve
their full academic and social
potential. Treat the students like
sixth formers, and you will get sixth
formers. Behave as a headmaster,
and that is how people will perceive
you.
Few people who come here
nowadays seem at all interested in
the history of Imperial. Most are
what I would consider inverted
Luddites. A l l that has come before
must be destroyed, everything must
be set up a new, in their own image.
Students seem less and less
interested in fitting in, more and
more with changing things to their
own preferences. I may seem
reactionary, but it has to be
acknowledged that it is the past
w h i c h gives an institution a
reputation. When a student leaves
for the great wide world, they will
rapidly find that much fh the world
is already laid down and they are
not going to burst onto the scene
and change it all. They are going to
engineers, Imperial should be
fulfilling its status as a university by
turning out fully rounded, mature
young people at the end of their
time at College, not dull, pre-
pubescent teenagers, devoid of even
a spark of imagination or social
acumen.
The trend in Imperial seems to be
towards admitting people to college
with regard only to their ' A ' level
grades. This is reflected in the
reduction o n the number of
interviews held with candidates,
and the trend towards ' A ' level
entry requirements regardless of the
candidate. It is not the sort of system
which gives a good social balance to
an institution, it merely ensures all
Eric A s h : A t the h u b , or left o n the sidelines?
