China: Students hold candlelit vigil
Thousands of students gathered outside the Chinese embassy on
Wednesday evening to attend a candlelit memorial vigil for the students
killed in Saturday's Tiananmem Square massacre.
According to police estimates,
4000 people, including delegations
from Imperial and other London
Colleges, turned u p to pay their
respects to the three thousand
students who died in their fight for
democracy in China.
The vigil, organised by the
Chinese Solidarity Campagain,
began at eight O'Clock with prayers
for the dead i n English a n d
Cantonese a n d c o n t i n u e d
throughout the night with speeches
of support calling for China to
withdraw its troops and for the
British Government to take action.
Actor, David Yip, read out the
following message of support from
Labour leader, N e i l K i n n o c k .
'We urge our country to respect
the deep concern of the many
Chinese students in Britain who fear
for the future if they are obliged to
return to China in the next few
weeks after completion of their
studies.'
The vigil w a s m o v i n g a n d
emotional, but many Chinese
students were angered by the
presence of socialist groups who
were u s i n g the occassion to
distribute leaflets and sell copies of
Labour News and Socialist Worker.
U n i v e r s i t y of L o n d o n Vice
President Louise Van Stratten told
FELIX later 'Killing is not political.
This was a memorial not a rally.'
Earlier i n the day 1000 people
attended a demonstration by the
National Union of Students (NUS)
. in front of the Chinese embassy
when petitions calling for an end to
the violence i n C h i n a were
presented to embassy officials.
The Imperial delegation placed a
wreath on the 'martyrs forireedom'
memorial and passed a petition ot
756 signitures (including the Rector
Professor Eric Ash) to the police
who handed it to an embassy
.official.
Speakers at the demonstration
urged British students to pressurise
the Government to take economic
and political sanctions against China
and to give assurances of protection
for those Chinese students who are
about to complete their degree
courses and for students from Hong
Kong.
Laurence W o n g , of the the
Chinese Solidarity Campaign told
FELIX that the British Governments
silence on China amounted to the
'most calloirs inhumanity.' H e
condemned British politicians for
not taking any measures to protect
Britain's 2,600 Chinese students
when President Bush has already
offered sanctuary to America's
40,000.
The Solidarity Campaign was
established in April this year when
the problems in China first came to
the fore. The organisation, based in
Shaftesbury Avenue has been
sending money to the campaigners
in China via Hong Kong although
lines of communication have now
been severed.
Support by London's student
unions for the students in China has
been g r o w i n g . Yesterday, as
anxious students tried
unsuccessfully to fax messages to
relatives in China, the University of
London Union (ULU) has pledged
to p r o v i d e publicity a n d
administrative help to Chinese
students campaigning against the
atrocities i n C h i n a a n d U L U
President, Ruth Benzimera will
present a paper to M o n d a y ' s
Collegiate Council, calling for the
University of London to make a
stance i n support of Chinese
students.
The paper will ask the University
to waive fees for Chinese students
in England should the Chinese
Government suspend their grants
and asks London Colleges to take
the events i n China into account
w h e n m a r k i n g the Chinese
student's examination papers. It
also calls for the University to exert
pressure o n the Govenrment to
extend the visas of Chinese students
currently in Britain.
Students at Imperial College have
signed 432 letters, which will be
delivered to Sir Geoffrey Howe,
calling for the British Government
to openly condemn the actions
taken by the Chinese Government
and to take sanctions against China.
A n account has been set up in the
National Westminster Bank as a
hardship fund for Chinese students
at Imperial College, should their
grants from China be cut off. The
Students Union will be placing
collection boxes i n the refectories
•today a n d next week w h i l s t
members of staff will be making
their own collections.
A meeting for Chinese students
and academic visitors has been
called by the Rector next Thursday.
FELIX has received unconfirmed
reports that one of the fifteen British
students on exchange in China for
London's School of African and
Oriental studies has refused to leave
the country in order to join student
leaders in their campaign against the
government.
