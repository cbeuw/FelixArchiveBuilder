Child's Play Pilobolus
Cert. 15
I have always found the sight of
dolls unsettling; the sickening smile,
that fixed plasticky expression, and
those flicking eyelids. It was only a
matter of time, then, that the horror
genre would latch o n to their
potential scare.
Unfortunately, in Child's Play this
chance has been missed due to a
ludicrous plot, and a misplaced
emphasis on trying to make the doll
act as human as possible through a
swamp of special effects.
Chucky is the doll in question, aka
Charles Lee Ray, a mass murderer
and, get this, a master of the
metaphysical art of soiil
transference. Just before being
pinned down by the police in a toy
shop he calls on the forces of
darkness to plant his soul into a
nearby doll. A mother (Catherine
Hicks) buys the doll for her six year-
old kid and then the fun starts. The
doll decides to start killing people
when it's so inclined and, of course,
the dum-dum authorities believe
they have a psychopathic kid on
their hands, so they lock him up.
Chucky then decides that he wants
to be human and to do this he has
to kill the boy. So it is left to the
mother and a token good guy cop
(Chris Sarandon) to try and save the
day.
The film lacks any psychological
subtlety which i n the hands of a
good director may have made it into
a masterful example of suspense
and horror. Instead, as is the
tendancy these days with the genre,

I was informed that Pilobolus is the
name of a hardy, hermaphroditic
fungus that thrives o n horse
manure, with that in mind I didn't
quite know what to expect from this
internationally established dance
theatre company. 1 knew it would
be strange; modern dance always is.
But I was quite unprepared for the
surreal dream-logic imagery, and
contortion of the body into a
wonderland of striking and comedic
motion.
The six member team performed
five pieces. The first, Bonsai, was a
short exercise in sexual ambiguity,
metamorphosis and illusion, to the
rhythm of mixed African tribal and
Oriental tones. The fusion of bodies
into the strange shapes w a s
fascinating to look at.
film-makers play on the silliness and
absurdity of the plot, making the
excuse that it's really a comic send
up. I f o u n d myself laughing
throughout, but for the wrong
reasons. You know something is
wrong when the acting of the 6 year-
old kid is far superior to that of the
adult cast.
I guess this is the type of film to
see when you've had a few pints
and the inside of your skull feels like
gravel pulp.

It may not be the O l d Vic, but it is
within walking distance and it is
over a Fuller's pub. If you can't
make it to the real thing, then this
makes a good substitute, mercifully
The second piece Moonblind was
a solo performance by the incredibly
talented Carol Parker. It was a
dreamy, sensual dance played to a
whining solo clarinet. The first half
is then rounded off with a jazzy
number to which clownish runners
fall about each other, emphasising
the rapid pace a n d impersonal
nature of today's society.
The second half consisted of two
longer, more involved, and very
enjoyable pieces. Land's Edge was a
surreal reworking of the good
Samaritan tale, or at least that's my
interpretation of it; and I'm Left,
You're Right, She's Gone was just
Rock ' n ' Roll fun with guys and gals
and the sound of Elvis. These two
were more theatrical pieces and
were a joy to watch.
I'm sure this form of experession
will not meet everyone's liking. Still,
I found it an enjoyable evening of
fractured beauty and confusion. The
d a n c i n g is remarkable—part
acrobatic, part mime—and the
physical control displayed is almost
painful to watch.
The company will only be around
until June 17 so why not go and
experience their w a r p e d ,
provocative, free-wheeling
imagination?
Standby tickets are available at £4.

for the fringe, sticking closely to
Shakespeare's script. The cast
perform capably enough, with
David Solomon outstanding as
Touchstone. It's a shame about the
set, though. The modern dress is
passable, but the dreadful matt
black and grey scenery makes one
feel that the enemies might not just
be winter and rough weather, but
the police c o m i n g to move
everybody on.

Remember Bedtime Story with David
Niven and Marlon Brando? N o , nor
do I. Well, here is the remake of that
1964 flop, now starring Michael
Caine and Steve Martin, and it will
almost definitely be a hit.
Caine plays a suave, aristocratic
European con-man, swindling rich
corruptible American women out of
their unearned cash on the French
Riviera. Martin is a crude, small-
time American hustler who joins
Caine, masquerading as his retarded
relative Prince Ruprecht (a role that
allows Martin to go totally over the
top in a way we haven't seen since
The Jerk). Subsequently, the two fall
out and then begins a battle of wits
to determine who gets to stay on to
scavenge the rich coastal town.
This is a charming comedy, with
the two stars in excellent form. They
are joined by Glenne Headley as
'the bet'—the first one who extracts
$50,000 from her wins...the other
leaves town. There are twists and
turns all over the place and it's all
great fun.
Frank (Yoda) Oz directs with an
assured hand emphasising the
gorgeous splendour of the settings.
In all, a delight.
