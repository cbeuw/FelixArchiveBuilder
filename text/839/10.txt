Another branch of Imperial
Imperial college acquired Silwood
Park in 1947 to replace the original
much smaller field station i n
Slough. Other than the Reactor
Centre which was purpose built, the
Biology Department at Silwood was
operated o n a 'split site' basis i n
Silwood House, Ashurst Lodge and
odd outbuildings including the Shell
Building built in 1988.
About five years ago, following
major U G C grant cuts, the College
decided that if operations at Silwood
were to continue then the site would
have to pay for itself insofar as was
possible. Therefore the Science Park
was built with the Technology
Transfer Centre where small
companies develop new products
often in collaboration with College
departments.
A l s o o n site is the U K
headquarters of the Commonwealth
Agricultural Bureaux Institute of
Biological Control which has a joint
library facility with the Biology
Department. This library is situated
in the C A B building and is a major
asset to students a n d staff at
Silwood housing the old Silwood,
and Ashurst libraries a n d the
C o m m o n w e a l t h Entomological
Library that was previously located
in Queensgate London. C A B has
facilities on-site for the importation,
screening a n d breeding of
pathogens and parasitoids under
quarantine conditions for use as
biological control agents. The new
biology blocks were built with the
proceeds from the sale of Ashurst
Lodge and four associated acres of
land.
Silwood has about thirty academic
staff, eighty\rton-academic staff and
about ninety postgraduate students.
It is used for field courses by the
biology a n d engineering
departments and also by other
colleges, eg the intercollegiate
London University Field Course in
Parasitology.
The last open day at Silwood was
in 1972. The aim of this open day
was to show local inhabitants, local
shcools, people from industry and
the research council's academics
f r o m other universities a n d
academic and administrative staff at
Imperial the n e w buildings at
Silwood and the work currently
being conducted here.
Mike Hassell FRS Director of
Silwood Park believes that the
future for operations at Silwood is
extremely good. Work should start
this autumn on the building of the
Interdisciplinary Centre i n
Population Biology and this with
current work already conducted at
Silwood will make it the world's
premier centre for ecological
research.
Many thanks to Mike Hassell FRS
for his help
HOCKEY
Imperial spirit
lives on
This Easter members of the Imperial
College Hockey Club Men's XI
competed i n the Folkstone
International H o c k e y Festival.
Wearing T-shirts kindly donated by
Vladivar Vodka bearing the motto
"The Imperial Spirit Lives' the team
had a difficult start losing to
Edinburgh University O l d Boys.
Centreforward Paul Skipworth
slid out of the tournament, breaking
his leg in a particularly fierce tackle
and before IC played the traditional
grudge match against the 'Windy.
Millers', IC O l d Boys side, losing 1-0
in a tight match. Regaining their
winning ways they defeated the
host side, the Folkestone Pessimists
3-2 and then drew against York
University. In the penalty shoot out
that followed goal keeper Jon Briggs
The team
held Y o r k out before Ian
Portsmouth scored the winning
goal.
This sadly is the last Festival for
many of the team. The brothers
Mark and A n d y Lewis leave after
three years in the Club as do the
mid-field base of Vince Coleman
and Jon Rose. This leaves the old
hands like R a y f i e l d a n d
Knaresborough to build a young
team next year.
Thanks again to Vladivar for the
T-shirts.
