Another year, another Death Grips leak
Henry Eshbaugh

T
he most avant-garde of
avant-garde rap groups
has leaked yet another
album: Bottomless Pit.
And it’s exactly what you’d expect.
It’s so good it’s bad. It’s so bad it’s
good. And it’s self-aware. We’ve
reached peak irony, and I for one
love it.
The band is hard to pin down
stylistically. Clearer influences
are dishwashers and industrial
motors. If one listens carefully, they
may discern MC Ride rapping,
gibberish-ing, and occasionally
screaming incoherently. Flatlander,
sometimes known as “Andrew,”
produces, and is possibly having
a seizure at the mixing board
(someone should check on him).
Zac Hill puts down drum tracks
that sound like Questlove on
crack – you might know him from
Hella, or a one-off with Weiss and
Cameron (you know, Pearl Jam and
Soundgarden) featuring nothing
but drums, appropriately titled
‘Drumgasm’.
Thebandiserratic.Thisistheirfirst
effort after their pledged breakup.
“We are now at our best and so
Death Grips is over.” “Plz give us
more,” cried the internet. “You’re
right, we might do another,” said
the band. Being a Death Grips fan
involves grueling masochism; the
cancelled shows,their evasive nature
(having done, to my knowledge,
only one interview – with Pitchfork,
a few years back), and the constant
push to inaccessibility with every
new album.
MC Ride’s characteristic
aggression is worthy of special
notice. “I don’t care about real life”
is the hook from the first song
off Jenny Death – titled ‘I Break
Mirrors With My Face In The
their sound in new directions.
Ride’s rapping has become
ingrained into the texture of the
song. The stuttering beats on ‘Three
Bedrooms In A Good Neighbors’
mix with cyberpunk-esque vibes
coherently. The riff to ‘Bottomless
Pit,’ the album’s closer, is a straight-
up punk banger. ‘Trash’ starts with
a V-I fanfare, over which Ride
raps unusually conventionally. On
‘8080808,’ they actually sample
‘Lock your Doors’ off NO LOVE
DEEP WEB. “Why?”, you may ask.
Well, why not?
Where are all the women in hip-hop?
Ben Collier

W
ith hip hop, as a
genre and a culture,
passing its 40th
anniversary in
recent years, a female presence is as
absent as ever. This is, of course, not
for a lack of talent. Ignoring some
examples like Iggy Azalea and
Kreayshawn, there is a lot of female
talent to be found in the realm of hip
hop music. But when I go onto the
featured rap artist page on Spotify I
only see two women (Missy Elliot
and MC Lyte) and around 60 men.
As someone who wants to see more
Lauryn Hills in the world, I really
have to question why this is.
The obvious answer ties into ideas
of masculinity. Traditionally, hip-
hop music is synonymous with ideas
of toughness, bravado and the ‘alpha
male’. This creates a culture where
any aspiring female MC must be a
“boss ass bitch” in order to be taken
seriously. This is true for gangster
rap anyways. As for the mainstream,
any women that do make it big are
often hypersexualised in an effort to
appeal the average male hip hop fan.
Ultimately, whilst the topic of sex
is something which features heavily
in the lyrics of a lot of male rappers,
the way it is approached here is
totally different. With a few notable
exceptions (e.g. Missy Elliot’s
‘Work It’) the way in which most
female MCs talk about sex just
shows us men’s sexual fantasies from
the other side. Female rappers rarely
talk about sex from any position
of power. “You can fuck my girls
too, daddy I’m-a condone it” and
“yes you be the boss, and yes I be
respecting” are literal Nicki Minaj
lyrics. It’s a world away from her

without meaning? If I were better at
philosophy, I could tell you how this
is all an excellent criticism of late
capitalism or something, but I think
I’ll leave that to better reviewers.
I dunno, man, carve out your own
meaning.But there’s some neat stuff
there.
Ten years ago, this album would
have been massacred by critics.
Today, they love it. Perhaps this
speaks to some generational divide,
with respect to a newfound sense
of irony, a fatalist zeitgeist without
regard for form, structure, or
objective aesthetics which manifests
in this piss-take of “real” music.
Indeed, in their break-up note,
Death Grips refers to themselves
as a “Conceptual art exhibition,
anchored by sound and vision,above
and beyond a ‘band.’” Or maybe the
lack of sleep from exam stress is
killing me, and I have no idea what
I’m talking about. Either way, if you
like the style, you won’t have more
fun with an album this year.

United States,’delivered with Ride’s
trademark insanity. Like, really?
Incoherent screaming and pledges
that “You’re fit to learn the meaning
of a beat down” (‘No Love’ off NO
LOVE DEEP WEB) grace his
performance. Ride’s artistic touch
has left every Death Grips album
to date littered with primal violence.
“IT GOES IT GOES IT GOES
IT GOES / GUILLOTINE!”
And yet, it all fits together. At the
service of the band is a boatload of
talent, and a healthy sense of irony
and self-consciousness. Combined
with punk ethos, the one sentence
that comes to mind to describe the
group is, “Eh, screw it, why not?”
Each past effort has succeeded in
the past because you don’t expect
it to – it’s perfectly composed, and
hideous at the same time.
And now, the new album.
Bottomless Pit is... exactly what
you’d think would happen. ‘Hot
Head’is by far the most inaccessible
track, complete with Ride literally
screaming nonsense with wild
abandon over bucking synths. The
synths still sound like they’re being
played out of a blown-out speaker,
and Hill still serves up some pretty
gnarly drumming.
But, the band continues to push
Why bother
making
sense in
a world
without
meaning?
Also,‘Warping’is if a bad acid trip
was a song.
The lyrics are best described as the
incoherent ravings of a psychopath.
I’d repeat some of the stranger verses
here,but Cale might think I’ve had a
stroke and phone an ambulance.The

and nihilist existentialism; why

verse on ‘Monster’ isn’t it?
This masculine culture is shaped
by both the artists and the fans.
The success of rap songs nowadays
is largely determined by internet
communities mostly made up
of young males. These groups
are perhaps not the most open
to listening to female MCs. As
a result of this, hip-hop culture
remains very accepting of a lot of
misogynistic language and ideas.
In the end, asking why there aren’t
more women in hip hop seems to
be comparable to asking why there
aren’t more black country singers. I
think there is hope though; perhaps
with a progressive movement away
from the ‘gangster rap’ culture of
the past towards the sound and
philosophies of rappers like Chance
the Rapper, Lupe Fiasco and J.
Cole we’ll see more women come
up. I hope so anyway.

One need only look to the career
trajectory of Nicki Minaj from
‘Playtime is Over’ to ‘Anaconda’
to see how this ‘sex sells’ ideology
ends up shaping the output of the
majority of female MCs.
