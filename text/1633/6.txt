COMMENT
Can men advise on how to respond to sexual
harassment?
Come back to me when you’ve had years of practice

P
icture the scene: A friend
of yours has just told you
about an experience of
theirs, one in which they
experienced discrimination, and
they’re pissed off. Why did they tell
you? So you could explain to them
how their reaction to the situation
was wrong, right?
It’s not news that many women
have to deal with a whole lot
of harassment based on their
gender. Sometimes it’s obviously
misogynistic (“I like the way
your tits bounce“) and sometimes
it’s more subtle (“you should
smile, beautiful”). It’s the kind of
harassment that, on the whole,
men don’t experience, and it can
be difficult to convey just how
prevalent a problem it is – which is
why it’s important to talk about it.
WhenItalktomyfriends–maleor
female – about being harassed, what
I’m looking for is support. I have
been told multiple times by harassers
(and some family members) that if I
dressed differently I’d be left alone.
I have been told this while covered
apart from the face and hands. It’s
bullshit.
Although I know that it’s not
my fault when I get harassed, it’s
important to me that my friends
reinforce this, instead of somehow
making me feel responsible; in
this, most of my friends are great,
indignant on my behalf and
sympathising with how annoying,
upsetting or scary it was.
However, I’ve noticed a trend in
some of my male friends’ responses
when I come to them to vent about
some random guy who felt the
need to tell me how attractive (or
not) I was: telling me I should have
behaved differently.
I recently came home frustrated
after having almost identical
conversations with two men on
the way home, both of whom took
issue with my ignoring them when
they “just wanted to give [me] a
compliment”, wanting to have a bit
of a rant and get on with my day.
My friend, a man, was naturally
on my side, but criticised my
response,saying that I “shouldn’t get
so confrontational”.
To clarify, I had told the men that
their comments were unwanted
and unsolicited – I didn’t raise my
voice, swear, or even respond until
they became verbally aggressive
when I ignored them. That’s not
to say I didn’t want to, but for me,
an encounter like this is a mental
battle between “I want to provoke
this person into reconsidering their
behaviour” and “I don’t want to
provoke this person into becoming
violent” – the latter generally taking
precedence. When these men
became angry at being ignored,I felt
my safest option was to engage. But
what, then, was I supposed to say?
Should I have smiled and laughed
along, reinforcing their belief that
their comments were acceptable, all
the while itching to leave as quickly
as possible?
I have tried this strategy and it
does not work. You cannot play
along forever; there comes a time
in any situation like this where you
have to tell the harasser “no”. You
ignore them, you tell them you’re
in a hurry, you tell them you’re not
interested, that you don’t want to
give them your number, that you
want them to stop talking to or
touching you, that you are ‘taken’,
and sometimes one of these is
enough, but sometimes not, and
there is no one phrase which will
instantly deter further attention. In
short, there is no right way to react.
Of course, the primary concern
should always be personal safety,
but when this happens on a regular
basis, “Sorry, I have a boyfriend”
starts to taste increasingly sour in
your mouth. So, sometimes, you
get “confrontational” by pointing
out that you’re not interested
in a stranger’s thoughts on your
appearance.
I know that my friend was just
concerned for my welfare, and his
advice given with good intentions,
but when you don’t face sexual
harassment on a regular basis it
is harder to empathise with how
it feels, so it’s infuriating when
men give helpful comments such
as “I’d be so sassy [in response to
harassment] if I were a woman”,
“why didn’t you just say you had a
boyfriend?”or “I don’t get it,he’s just
talking to you.”
If you’re a man and a woman is
telling you about a time when she
got harassed, there are a couple of
things you should know: First, there
are countless other instances she
hasn’t told you about. This is not
the only time.
Second, you cannot know how
you would respond in her shoes
because you have not experienced
those countless other instances.
Don’t try to tell her what she should
have done, but be responsive to her
feelings – if she’s telling you because
it was funny, agree that it was funny,
and if she’s telling you because it
upset her,agree that it was upsetting.
Don’t tell her that her emotions are
wrong, and definitely don’t tell her
that she’s overreacting and it wasn’t
harassment at all.
There is no
one phrase
which will
instantly
deter further
attention
When you
don’t face
sexual
harassment
on a regular
basis it is
harder to
empathise
with how it
feels
