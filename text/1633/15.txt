s I sat placidly in
my seat waiting for
the play to start, the
announcement to turn
off our mobile phones was played.
That was all expected. But then the
announcement repeated itself, and
it seemed that a thousand voices
were echoing it at the same time,
louder and louder and reaching a
mad climax – then in a snap the
theatre went dark and a scene from
The Seagull appeared before us.
That opening sequence caused
me much alarm – in my wild
imagination I thought the theatre
had been hijacked. But it was the
first of many points in the play
when director Jeremy Herrin makes
the experience of the drug and
cigarette addicted protagonist the
audience’s experience as well. People,
Places and Things tells the story of a

The National’s unpredictable triumph is revived in style at the Wyndham’s Theatre
and morphed, and an identically-
dressed receptionist popped up
beside the first as the protagonist
speaks to him in her drug-addled
state. Indeed, much of the action
happens when the ensemble of
Emmas is out, all dressed exactly
like her, crawling out of her bed,
emerging from the toilet, climbing
out of the wall, each convulsed in
tormented jerky movements – the
visual manifestation of what must
be her own delusions arising from
drug withdrawal. In this way, the
production actually sheds light on
psychiatric issues that are rarely
discussed in public, much less in
such a visceral way.
Perhaps on a more metaphorical
level, these multiple selves of Emma
represent her conflicted views of
the world and fragments of identity
that she cannot reconcile. Emma/
Sarah is clearly a sharply intelligent
girl who overthinks the workings
of the world, and creates for herself
elaborate, noble excuses for her
drug habit. “How can you sit here
pretending that everything is going
to be alright when there are people
starving in the world?” she asks the
therapist. “Drugs are the only way
to make me feel authentic, give me
real experiences. If I deny myself
choice,” she declares, “then what
am I?”These may be the words of a
helpless addict, but it is a sensitive
acknowledgement of the addict’s
own perspective that her habit is the
only sense of control she feels over
her life and her view of the world.
young drug addict seeking help at a
drug rehabilitation clinic. Although
not an uncommon narrative, this
production wins with the intensity
with which we are immersed in it,
especially in the mind of the girl
herself.

An intense,
visceral
experience
that will give
you your high
Denise Gough carries her
unpredictable character brilliantly.
At times, she is a fiery ball of anger
eloquently rebutting everything the
therapists and her fellow addicts tell
her, at other times she’s a tormented
soul suffering under her drug
habits. Behind her prickly exterior
lies a girl who desperately wished
for acceptance by her mother. This
theme of acting and meta-acting
was displayed from the start, when
the “backstage” curtains fell shortly
after the play began to reveal
another set of audiences on the
other side.Each block of audience is
watching and being watched by the
other – emphasizing the staginess of
the stage in between.
People, Places and Things is an
intense, visceral experience that will
give you your high (safely), while
also getting you to question your
assumptions about the world.
People, Places and Things is at the
Wyndham’s Theatre until 18th
June.

Variously known as Nina,
Emma, Sarah and Lucy, the
protagonist’s identity is as fluid as
her delusions. Her drug-induced
visions are played out in vivid
detail to the audience. I gasped

T
he National’s latest
modernisation of an old
classic, The Suicide has all
the potential of a biting
satirical comedy with little of the
finesse or foundation to really pull
it off. While the laughs are frequent
and at times provocative, the play
struggles to maintain its momentum
and leaves little of an underlying
narrative.
The Suicide
Max Falkenberg
Arts Editor
An adaptation of the Erdman classic amuses and underwhelms in equal measure
all urge him to do the right thing
– die for the benefit of their cause.
Played by the boisterous Javone
Prince of PhoneShop fame, Sam is
soft and charming, but lacking the
direction that would really make
him shine. With a solid supporting
cast including the likes of Paul Kaye
and Ashley McGuire, the overall
presentation is enjoyable, but not
exactly special.
As is so often the case at the
National, the set is a highlight of
the production with all the frills and
flair of big budget theatre. However,
despite its impressive appearance, it
feelsoddlyunoriginal.Thinkingback
to the shows of 2015, The Suicide’s
stylised dystopian backdrop,
frequent use of multimedia and
drum solo soundtrack all bear
uncanny resemblance to the
production features in Golem – a
personal highlight from last year’s
calendar.
The Suicide is far from boring,
but the play fails to take that step
above and beyond the comedy. The
laughs are often cheap and hastily
stereotyped – for what should be a
fiery political satire, the comedy is a
little bland. It is clear that the script
is for today’s audience with many
of the best jokes touching on the
current affairs of 2016. However, I
can’t help but feel that more time
in development would have done
wonders for this production. Where
the script seems to be steering to
hilarity, the punchlines are a let-
down,and where split second timing
is crucial, the text is too fluffy to
really hit home. Equally, while the
momentum consistently builds as
the play goes on, the two and a half
hour runtime leaves the last thirty
minutes stagnant. The body is there
and the intention is clear, but they
haven’t trimmed the fat.
The Suicide is running at the
National Theatre until 25th
June
