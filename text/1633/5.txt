We need to talk about Israel
You can criticise Israel without being anti-semitic

t’s like that old saying goes,
‘you wait for one anti-semitism
scandal, and then three come
along at once’. First was
the election of Malia Bouattia as
NUS president, whose labelling of
Birmingham as a Zionist outpost
was quite problematic, then came
the four-year-old posts of MP
Naz Shah saying that the people
of Israel should be relocated to
America (okay, more than a little
more problematic). Finally, the nail
in the coffin for the Labour party’s
anti-semitism problem, the former
Mayor of London compared the
intentions of Israel to that of Hitler.
Well.That is very problematic.
This has led to calls for Jeremy
Corbyn to address the “rife anti-
semitism” within his party, and
indeed the left as a whole. Okay, so
how do I say this? Ken Livingstone
was completely wrong, Naz Shah
posted things that should not have
been posted, but maybe, just maybe,
not being a fan of the state of Israel
is not anti-semitic, and has more
to do with distaste for its foreign
policy and the 50 year occupation
than for Jewish people?

One of the principal problems is
that the term ‘Zionist’ carries the
baggage of centuries of anti-semitic
sentiment in the form of the belief
that Jewish people are part of some
shadowy organisation that controls
the world from behind the scenes –
obviously this belief is anti-semitic
and a hokey conspiracy theory.
It should also be acknowledged
that the idea that Jewish spiritual,
cultural,and political identity resides
in the land they were forced out of
– and indeed the idea of creating a
state to unite the Jewish people –
was in response to the continuous
persecution of the Jewish people.
My issue comes with the fact
that these anti-semitic allegations
may soon become shorthand for
any accusations towards the state
of Israel, thus denouncing any
constructive discussion on foreign
policy. Ken Livingstone’s statement
comparing Israel’s motivations to
those of Hitler was the headline-
grabbing statement; however, the
rest of his statement was this: “The
simple fact in all of this is that Naz
made these comments at a time
when there was another brutal
Israeli attack on the Palestinians”.
It is my personal opinion, and
that posed by the three figures
mentioned in the first paragraph,
that the State of Israel continues
to get away with human rights
violations that it commits in the
name of self-defence in the 21st
century.
Here is a quick rundown of those
committed in the last 12 months,
according to Human Rights Watch
or Amnesty International: In a
report published in April 2016,
it was found that the number of
Palestinian children arrested and
detained along the West Bank had
doubled since October, defying
international laws that dictate a
parent or guardian must be present,
and this came along with reports of
child abuse by the Israeli security
service towards these children.
In March 2016, it emerged that
Abd al-Fatah al-Sharif, who was
alleged to have stabbed an Israeli
soldier, was executed with an assault
rifle after being wounded. This has
been re-ordered and a legal case to
prosecute the soldier in question for
war crimes continues; however, the
In defence of ales
Ales are heavenly elixirs that
don’t need to be cold and fizzy
to taste wonderful

very Friday I pick up a
copy of FELIX to glance
at the headline, look at
the centrefold to see if
I recognise anyone in it, quietly
complain to myself that my half-
hearted attempts at developing a
six-pack have yet to succeed, read
Hangman, lament the fact that
it's only one page long, and amuse
myself with the idea of running for
FELIX Editor just to convert the
whole damn thing into 32 pages of
Hangman 4 teh lulz (note to Grace,
I’m not actually seriously going to
do it).
Which is why when, this time,
I actually flipped through what
the cat brought in, I saw a picture
of four beautiful, cold, gleaming
chalices of my favourite alcoholic
drink on Earth, and got deflated by
dear Pietro’s lengthy denunciation
of it. Now, if I were not wizened
by the deep, harrowing abyss that
is the 9Gag comment section, I’d
have screamed out “I’m offended!”,
to which my roommate would
have said “Hi offended, I’m Dad”.
Instead, I accept his concession to
accept people who love ales, but
Heavenly
exquisite
elixir

angels and
unicorns
then, I’m bored out of my wits and
am looking for something to divert
me from cold, hard reality.
Now some of you may wonder
why I’m doing this. Why are you
picking a fight for no reason and
belabouring a dumb, moot point?
To which I reply that I descend from
a family in which my father met
my mother when he gatecrashed a
wedding my mother was attending,
and one in which my mother
pranked her colleague by telling
her that a certain Ms Lyon was
asking for her, and gave her a phone
number to call, which turned out to
be the Zoo.
In complete disagreement with
my dear Pietro, I believe that ale is
the most heavenly exquisite elixir
brewed by angels and unicorns.
Being unable to rely on being ice
cold or fizzy like lager in order to
actually taste good, it tastes good
on its own merit. Every wholesome,
rich, textured drop is a delight to
the senses, and, being heavy, I feel
like I’m having a real, proper drink
which feels like a full meal instead
of the bad lager, which, devoid of
all content, serves only to get you
wasted. It’s not that I don’t like
lager. Hoegarden, Carling, Tsingtao
and London Lager (the yellow tap
at Eastside) are definite beauts,
and I can swallow down Carlsberg,
Heineken and Stella anyday, but
ales are in a whole different league.
Coming from a country where the
local alcoholic scene consists of the
world’s second highest alcohol tax
after Norway, a piteous selection
of lagers (Carlsberg, Heineken,
Tiger and not much else), a large
population of teetotallers and social
disapproval, the UK is a dream! I’d
never seen more than five taps at a
bar before (granted I don’t go out
much).
As a history and trivia buff, I
know that ale is the traditional type
of beer that was drunk all over the
world before a new type of yeast was
introduced,giving rise to lagers.This
was the stuff the ancient Egyptians
drank, and which your ancestors
probably drank (But not mine.
Mine drank tea), and when the time
came for everything to change, the
British, in a quintessentially British
move, decided to stay out of it.
On your point about how ale ruins
nights out, I respectfully disagree,
it’s the only thing that allows me to
go on nights out. Beer is about the
only alcoholic drink I can tolerate
before my alcohol flush kicks in and
turns my face redder than the on
my first date. It’s the only alcoholic
drink that tastes good on its own. I
mean if vodka tasted good instead
of potato juice with a strong hint
of industrial solvent, you wouldn’t
need to mix it in with coke to hide
the taste. Also, I can’t afford whisky
and good wine, and I don’t dare try
the hard liquor China passes off as
beer (Moutai, anyone?).
And don’t get me started on craft
beers. Don’t you denounce craft
beers! They’re the one thing that
rescued the American beer industry
by flooding it with actual, quality
beverages. You, in your spirited
Also, I
can’t afford

snobbery (pun fully intended)
have failed to see the multitudes
of American beer lovers who hail
their rescue from the clutches of
Budweiser, Coors, and Miller which
they had to gulp down for decades
with tears in their eyes. It is the
passionate, can-do, experimental
attitude of brewers who made
America great again, in the hard
work, value-adding type of way, not
in the build a wall and encourage
xenophobic racism while waving
your tiny orange hands kind of way.
In short,we get it Pietro.You don’t
like ales, its fine, but you don’t need
to rub it in everyone’s faces.But,as a
Malaysian speaking to an Italian, let
me extend an olive branch of peace,
and while we can agree to disagree
on ales, we can both agree on two
very important points. English food
is boring, and Budweiser tastes
absolutely disgusting.
Israeli forces rarely prosecute any of
their soldiers accused of war crimes.
Finally, the Israel Defence Forces
(IDF) launched an aerial offensive
in Gaza on July 8th, followed by a
ground offensive on July 17th. The
UN has identified 538 children
among the 1563 Palestinian
civilians killed.
It is also worth noting that
Palestine is not an entirely passive
country – there are frequent suicide
bombings and stabbings which are
attributed to Hamas, meaning they
are not blameless in the conflict.
To any normal person, the
vocalisation of objections to the
murder of children and the violation
of human rights should be able to
be placed in a public forum without
fear of being labelled as either racist
or anti-semitic, two of the worst
things I could ever imagine being
called.
Equally, politicians must be able
to voice valid criticisms of Israel,
for they are supposedly the ones
that could enact some change,
make them criminalise torture, hold
those responsible for committing
war crimes accountable. However,
if every time we try to have a
constructive conversation about
Israel it is shut down by either
offensive racial slurs or a reluctance
to criticise, then what’s the point?
