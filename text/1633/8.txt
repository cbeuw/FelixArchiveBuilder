Halley’s Comet, a ball of ice and
rock left over from the creation
of the Milky Way, only makes an
appearance every 75 years, so sadly
we have to wait until 2061 before we
get another glimpse of it. However,
we are in the midst of meteor
shower.Earth is twirling though the
tail of Halley’s Comet. Therefore, it
is inevitable that tiny debris falling
into our atmosphere will burn up
leading to a month-long annual
spectacle called Eta Aquarids.
Lucky stargazers in the southern
hemisphere will witness 30-40
meteors flying through the night
sky per hour whereas the northern
stargazers will see 10-20. The best
time to view this spectacle is in early
hours of morning before twilight,
5th
- 7th
May. A dark remote spot
away from light pollution is a better
place to witness the shower but you
won’t need any fancy astrophysics
equipment if you decide to. Don’t
worry if you miss it this time as late
October will provides the Orionid
meteor shower.
At Sh!t Sc!ience, we believe that
all science, no matter how stupid it
sounds, has a purpose and adds to
the sum of human knowledge. This
week: the science of gingerness.
You’ll have seen this story. From
Prince Harry to Julianne Moore,
the honorary heads of the ginger
committee are strewn across the
most reputable science sections.
The reason? Ice cold revenge! It is
now scientifically proven that even
though you are growing older and
saggier by the minute (yes...you
are), redheads are more likely to
remain as baby-faced as when you
were making fun of them in school.
Well… they look a bit younger.
Well… by two years. Maybe not
the greatest payback for years of
mockery.
The study behind the finding
was published this week by a team
of scientists from the Erasmus
University. After asking people
to estimate the age of the 2693
members of their cohort based

The key to eternal youth is being ginger... kind of
solely on pictures of their faces,
the scientists cross-referenced the
‘perceived age’ with differences
in their cohort’s genotypes. They
found one gene that could be
associated with youthful looks,
the MC1R gene. This gene codes
for the melanocortin1 receptor, a
protein which regulates the ratio
of pheomelanin (a blond or red
pigment) to eumelanin (a brown
or black pigment), which gives
hair its shading. The youthful look
was associated with a particular
variation of the MC1R gene.
These gene variant codes for a
melanocortin1 receptor, which in
turn produces very little eumelanin,
and is subsequently associated with
red hair. And there you have it, red
hair is linked to youthful looks.
‘That’s it?’, I hear you cry? ‘All that
genetic encoding and screening for
that?’ I agree, but as always, this
study actually represents a tiny step
in a much bigger endeavour. While
the first genome took 13 years to
sequence, an entire human
genome can now be sequenced
in days.This staggering progress
has encouraged the hope that
through the reading of our
genomes, we would finally be
able to predict and prevent
disease. Programs such as the
Rotterdam study, the Leiden
Longevity study and the Twins
UK studies, have provided
huge repositories of thousands
of genomes. This information
allows us to filter through
millions of bytes of data to
look for the elusive genes
that could be responsible for
Alzheimer’s disease, the genetic
malformation which causes the
terrible Parkinson’s disease, and
also the gene that makes us look
younger when we’re not. That is
the power of Big Data, and we
should expect to see many more
of these studies in the coming
years.
Science, what’s good?
Where would you store your data?
Magnetic tapes? Hard drives? What
about DNA? It is possible to store
and retrieve, say, 10,000 GB worth
of data in a tiny pink DNA smear
at the end of a test tube. DNA
stores data in a code of A,T,C and
Gs. Computers store data in a digit
code of 0s and 1s. If you produce
nucleotide strands in the lab,
combinations can then be developed
to produce a code standing for
letters, numbers or other digital
information, combining these two
languages. This allows compacting
of information to a smaller degree
ever artificially achieved with
human technological developments.
In addition DNA can protect the
data, which can remain unchanged
for thousands of years. Scientists
can even employ PCR techniques
to produce large quantities of DNA
strands increasing the chance that
the DNA strand picked contains the
information we want. The future of
storage is here and it’s genetic.

When we consider the impact of
climate change on our oceans, we
often think of overfishing or coral
bleaching. People rarely consider
the impacts on drifting planktonic
species, invisible to the human eye.
Their lack of observability should,
however, not lead to disregarding
their importance. Drifting plankton
comprise the oceans “lungs”, and
support fisheries across the globe.
Scientists at the University of
Technology, in Sydney Australia,
and Imperial College London
have been modelling how such
plankton drift along the ocean
currents to understand the impact
of climate change on these species.
As plankton hitch a ride on ocean
currents, they’re often subjected to
temperature changes of up to 10
°C. These exposures to various
temperature changes are thought
to play a role in how plankton may
respond to climate changes. So any
previous studies will probably need
to re-evaluate their predictions
take into account these effects.

When it comes to the best
treatments available for autism,
early intervention is key. Despite
this, autism in most children is
not diagnosed until they’re four
years of age, when challenges in
communication, social disabilities,
and repetitive behaviour patterns
become apparent. Researchers at
UT Southwestern medical centre
have recently identified an Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) blood
biomarker, which allows early
identification with an accuracy of
up to 80%. They found that boys
with the disorder had significantly
reduced levels of the igG1 antibody.
The 25 peptide compounds that
bind to igG1 serum protein were
then analysed, and one was isolated,
now identified as ASD1, which
could diagnose the disorder with a
66% accuracy. Combining ASD1
with measures of thyroid stimulating
hormone levels subsequently
increased accuracy of identification
to 73%.However,more testing must
be carried out for further validation.

Forget road rage, what about
air rage? As flying is becoming
more and more frequent for many,
it is important we understand
what gets us so hot and bothered
under our seatbelt. Long queues,
delayed flights, little leg room are
only a few of the inconveniences
that drive up our cortisol levels.
However, new research conducted
by Katy Decelles at the University
of Toronto’s Rotman School of
Management and Micheal Norton
of the Harvard Business School
found that air rage is more likely
to occur when the plane has first
class seats. Class inequality seems
to bring out the worst in people.
The study didn’t go into depth as
to why this was the case, however
previous research has indicated that
people exhibit a decrease in general
well-being when they feel they are
treated unfairly or unequally. So if
airlines want to ensure smoother
flights for their passengers, they
may want consider doing away with
classes altogether.

aradoxically, antibiotics
are essential for fighting
bacterial infections, but
they also make our bodies
more prone to further infection.
New research at the University of
California is trying to illuminate
the paradox. The chain of events
begins with antibiotics depleting
the ‘good’ bacteria in our guts.
These bacteria are necessary for
the breakdown of gut -fibre which
produces butyrate, an essential
organic acid for gut lining cells.
With decreased availability of
butyrate, the oxygen consumption
of these cells declines, and thus
oxygen levels in the gut increases.
These conditions favour the growth
of Salmonella. The research links
levels of butyrate-producing
microbes to inflammatory bowel
disease. Further research is needed
though to see if Salmonella is the
sole culprit.

reakfast this morning got
me thinking. It merely
involved microwaving
frozen bread prior to
making French toast, but the
nonchalant routine reminded me
to extol the virtues of frozen food,
something I think many of us tend
to overlook.
Sadly, the modern consumer is
inclined to look down on frozen
goods. We scoff at the stiff-edged
bags roughly clumped together in
the freezer aisles, associating the
‘less-for-more’ prices with poor
quality and unnecessary teeth
breaking. Truth be told, the lower
prices are not in any way linked to
poorer quality.Frozen food is simply
much cheaper to produce and sell
compared to its fresh counterparts,
hence the less hefty price tags.
A recent study illuminated the
very reason why we should resolve
our issues with anything that’s not
‘fresh and whole’. Food stored at
-20oC in the freezer compared to
that stored at 4-5oC locks in many
more key nutrients and antioxidants.
We could be doing ourselves a
world of good just by freezing more
seasonal fruit and vegetables this
way. We enjoy all the nutritional
goodness they have to offer without
having to sacrifice any volume.
Note the word ‘seasonal’ here.
Freezing produce that has to go at
some point, or tastes better at one
time of year than another, will let us
enjoy all the most desirable flavours
and textures for as long as we want.
It was found that many anthocyanin
flavonoids (that help protect our
livers and decrease blood pressure)
are preserved for several months in
foods such as blueberries. Similarly
vitamins such as riboflavin (B1) and
Vitamin C are not only successfully
preserved, but can even be found in
higher quantities in frozen foods
than in fresh produce.
Bread’s another good example
highlighting the value of freezing.
This is how it works: Before baking,
starch granules in dough are
geometrically arranged,but this nice
geometry is changed once water is
added to the mix and dough is left
to rise before baking. Starch absorbs
the water and the granules take on a
more irregular form. They however
start to undergo recrystallisation
after baking, the cooling process
allowing the granules to revert back
to a more regular geometry. The
continuous recrystallization process
is what contributes to staling, which
unfortunately occurs much faster in
the fridge than if you chuck your
loaf into the freezer.
Of course, we still have to be a
little picky. Freezing creates ice
crystals, and the more water content
a fruit or vegetable has, the bigger
these ice crystals, so it would be
a good idea to leave things like
mushrooms and lettuce out of the
picture. Otherwise, most anything
can be frozen, including meat, fish,
bread, and even most aromatic
spices. Go ahead– freeze it up!
