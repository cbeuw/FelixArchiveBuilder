A guide to Eurovision 2016
The top ten countries to look out for at this years Eurovision Song Contest
A
fter Måns Zelmerlöw’s
victory for Sweden in
Vienna last year,this year
sees “Europe’s favourite
TV show” head to Stockholm for
the third time in the competition’s
history, and it’s set to be a big one!
We’ll also see a massive change
to the voting system, with each
country awarding two sets of points
each: one from their televote, one
from their professional jury.
42 countries will participate,
with Australia being welcomed
back after their debut as a special
guest last year as well Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia and
Ukraine returning after absences
from the competition. Portugal
are not returning this year and
Romania were disqualified at the
last minute due to non-payment of
debts to the European Broadcasting
Union (their song was one of my
favourites, I’m not even bitter).
Here are my top ten songs to keep
an eye out for, comprised of some
of the bookies’ favourites as well as
some of my own, in no particular
order:
Malta Russia
Montenegro
Sweden Bulgaria
France
Cyprus Estonia
And I’ve not forgotten about the
United Kingdom! For the first year
I’ve not included the UK in my list,
because our chances of doing well
are particularly slim this year. I like
the song, ‘You’re Not Alone’ by Joe
and Jake, but it’s a tad forgettable
and isn’t helped by us not being too
popular with Europe at the moment
(owing to a certain referendum).
We’ll struggle to get out of the
bottom five this year, maybe we’ll
even place last. But that’s nothing
new, and it’s all part of the fun!
And that’s not all. There are 31
other songs in this year’s contest.
18 will perform in each of the semi
finals,with ten from each joining the
Big Five plus Sweden in the Grand
Final. The perfect procrastination
material: the semi-finals take place
on the 10th
and 12th
of May, with the
Grand Final following on Saturday
the 14th. Don’t miss it!

I loved Montenegro’s song last
year despite the odds of it winning
being 100/1. This year the odds are
500/1 but again there’s something
about it that I can’t get enough of,
probably the driving guitar riff of
the chorus. ‘The Real Thing’ by
Highway is a powerful but cheesy,
rock-come-dubstep song that
probably won’t qualify for the final,
but will certainly get the arena
going during the semis. Then again,
Montenegro beat the odds last year
and ended up not only qualifying
for the final, but also placing a very
respectable 13th
. Can Highway do
the same this year? (I doubt it.)
Ira Losco represented Malta in
2002, placing a very impressive 2nd
in the final. Fourteen years later and
she’s back again! She’ll be singing
‘Walk On Water’, a punchy, crowd-
pleasing song that’s one of the
favourites to win.I’m less convinced,
finding it a little forgettable, but it’s
sure to place in the top ten. Can Ira
beat her 2002 attempt and bring
Eurovision 2017 to Valletta? It’s a
definite possibility!
Russia came second last year,much
to the dismay of the arena, with
‘anti-booing technology’ having to
be employed for the first time in
the competition’s history. This year
they’re favourite to win, sending
Sergey Lazarev to sing ‘You Are
The Only One’, a song that is pure
Eurovision. With its infectiously
catchy chorus and driving beat
that’ll have everyone at home’s toes
tapping, it’s a really solid song.
Minus One are representing
Cyprus with ‘Alter Ego’, one of the
few rock songs this year. Eurovision
can be a tough place for rock groups
who aren’t dressed up as monsters,
but I think ‘Alter Ego’ has enough
pop influence to qualify for the final,
and I love it! Cyprus has never won
the competition before, in fact the
best they’ve ever placed is fifth.They
don’t look set to beat that this year
but a top ten finish for this song
would be a success.
This year’s host nation takes
Eurovision seriously. Very
seriously. Their selection process,
Melodifestivalen, is one of the most
watched shows in the Swedish
television calendar and is probably
the most rigorous selection process
in Europe. This year, by some
miracle, Frans and his song ‘If I
Were Sorry’ won and will represent
Sweden. By an even bigger miracle,
it’s third favourite to win. How
what I think is a painfully boring,
monotonous, middle-of-the-road
song is so popular is a mystery to
me. Nonetheless it’ll definitely
make the top five, maybe make the
top three and could well win.
Being a member of the Big Five,
France automatically qualifies
for the final, and this year it’s set
to finish in the top three. Amir
will sing ‘J’ai Cherché’, an upbeat,
catchy,feel-good song that’ll get the
arena going and the viewers voting.
Though it’s not in my personal
top three, I wouldn’t be sad to see
this win. After all, Paris is pretty
close to London (somewhere the
competition definitely won’t be held
next year).
Bulgaria first entered Eurovision
in 2005, and has only gotten to
the final once. They’re returning to
the contest for the first time since
2013, sending Poli Genova to sing
‘If Love Was a Crime’. A returning
artist, Poli represented Bulgaria
in 2012, failing to qualify. This
year she’s set to do well with this
upbeat, powerful anthem. I’d like
to see Bulgaria place in the top five,
because I love the song.
If George Ezra were to perform
a song by Gary Barlow, you’d have
Estonia’s entry this year. The deep-
voiced Jüri Pootsmann will sing
‘Play’, and I love it. Dark, subtle
and jazzy, it’s one of my top songs
this year. It’s not expected to do
particularly well, but I’ll class it
qualifying for the final as a success.
Go Jüri!

Latvia are sending Justs with his
song ‘Heartbeat’, a song that I’m
not all too enamoured with. Using
up all of its potential with a great
first verse that wouldn’t sound out
of place on a Metronomy album,
the song soon turns into a slightly
tedious club anthem that somehow
both ends abruptly whilst also
making three minutes seem like a
long time. However it’s shown early
potential with fans and it’ll most
likely place in the top ten, maybe
even the top five.

Before you go rummaging through
your GCSE Geography textbooks,I
know, Australia isn’t in Europe and
no, I haven’t misspelled Austria.
Eurovision is massively popular
down under and so they were
allowed to enter the competition last
year as a special guest to mark the
60th
anniversary of Eurovision,being
told that they could only come back
again if they won. They came fifth,
but Europe enjoyed having them so
much that we welcomed them back
as a regular contestant anyway. This
year they aren’t messing around,
sending Dami Im to sing ‘Sound Of
Silence’, a powerful anthem that’s
almost sure to place in the top five.
