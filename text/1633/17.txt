ollowing last week’s
relatively uneventful,
measured episode, Game of
Thrones cranks the dial up
to eleven with this one. Last time
was the safety briefing; now we’ve
hit the first drop on the rollercoaster.
We open in Winterfell of old, as
Bran and the Three-eyed Raven
watch the previous generation
of Starks in their younger days.
The scene serves as an excellent
reintroduction to Bran, and an
effective way to familiarise the
audience with his growing abilities;
without resorting to an exposition
dump.
We finally catch a (non-stone)
glimpse of Lyanna Stark; getting
some idea of character. This serves
to give us some context on the
woman who launched a civil war,
and puts her in the forefront of
our minds in anticipation of next
week; when we’ll be treated to
perhaps one of the most important
events in recent Westerosi history.
Interestingly, there is also a glimpse
of young Hodor, with his faculties
intact.Given the tight pacing of this
episode, it seems unlikely that this
would be included without cause.
Then, in King’s Landing, it’s
Myrcella’s funeral, but first we stop
by the pub to pay our respects to
the flasher from Cersei’s walk of
shame last season. Alongside a very
agitated Robert ‘totally not the
mountain’ Strong. I mean, come on,
his name is in the credits.This scene
is actually pretty funny,and provides
a nice respite from all the other
seriousness in the episode. In fact,
Cersei, has a little trouble with
faithful husbands) in the sept;
stopped only by the appearance of
a lot of the faithful. This scene also
gives us a fantastic line in the form
of the Sparrow’s codded warning
to Jamie, “I fear a great many
things…the father, the mother, the
warrior”. Cersei’s original cold and
vindictive persona also makes a bit
of a resurgence, after the previous
episode’s attempts to make her seem
more sympathetic and likeable. The
balance struck here is just right.
In present day Winterfell,
whatever Roose Bolton’s
machinations for Ramsey are move
forward as his wife gives birth to a
baby boy. For about two minutes,
that is, when Ramsey decides to
stab him to death. Poisoned by his
enemies, such a sad way to go. This
may be the biggest issue with the
episode. Bolton Sr. feels completely
wasted, and his arc a massive anti-
climax. Maybe there was some
Back in Mereen, things continue
to fall apart,so Tyrion decides to see
if he can get the Dragons involved.
The scene actually adds some
interesting depth to the dragon’s
characterisation, and makes them
feel like more than just the one note
killing machines we’ve seen up till
now. Dinklage, in particular, is on
top form here, as he does a great job
of building tension considering he’s
working with CGI.
Theon decides to part ways with
Sansa and head home; promising to
make good to the Starks. But which
home? Will he head to the Iron
Islands, or to Winterfell, to try and
get even with Ramsey. Speaking
of the Iron Islands, we’re finally
reunited with Balon Greyjoy. And
then he gets pushed off a bridge.
Hey, at least he technically won the
War of Five Kings. This also serves
as an exposition heavy and storm
saturated, albeit still fairly effective,
introduction to his brother, Euron.
And finally, at Castle Black, Jon
Snow wakes up. Some other cool
shit happens too; the wildlings
kick Thorne’s ass and we get to see
the giant again. But really, Snow’s
resurrection was deftly handled.
I’m glad they didn’t drag it out too
much,since it was fairly obvious he’d
be back. Too much narrative focus
has been on him until now for that.
It’s also an exciting indicator for just
how much is likely to happen this
season.The hype train rolls onto the
next episode,where it seems an even
bigger revelation awaits.
Game of Thrones is available on
HBO Go
in general the writing has managed
to pull off dry wit pretty well so far
this season.
Jamie continues his journey
towards not giving a fuck and
almost straight up murders the
High Sparrow (is it just me that
he reminds of Bernie Sanders? It
doesn’t help that his primary rival,
miscommunication between writer
and director,but the constant baiting
of Ramsey on his part really felt like
it was part of some grand scheme.
What other possible reason could
someone as supposedly shrewd as
Bolton have for pushing Jr. that far?
Total narrative blue balls. Oh, and
then Ramsey has his dogs eat his
step-mum and baby brother. I didn’t
mind this too much, but his villainy
is just reaching cartoonish levels
now. Next week, I predict he’ll dress
up like a ghost and try to scare away
Mystery Inc. from the abandoned
amusement park.
