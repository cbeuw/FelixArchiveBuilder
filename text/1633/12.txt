FILM
A
lthough admirable is an
adjective too-often used
to describe films whose
artistic vision falls short
of the final product,there is no word
that I can think of more suited to
describe Hungarian Holocaust
dramaSonofSaul.InmostHolocaust
dramas, the cinematic narrative is
structured in order to create the
most emotionally charged story
possible – to give the impression
of the gravity and sheer scale of the
Holocaust and the victims created
by the Nazi dictatorship. The Boy
in the Striped Pyjamas comes to
mind, where everything – from the
euphoric music, to the dialogue,
right down to the nuanced acting –
is engineered in order to profit from
an emotional response from the
audience, the cynical possibility of
an Oscar hanging somewhere in the
near future. In the end, these films
seem to almost trivialise the topic
of the Holocaust, and while their
aims may be noble, this method
lacks emotional subtlety and creates
a work with the feeling of emotional
artifice. You may have guessed that
Son of Saul is the complete antithesis
of this. It is a piece of art that will
endure years to come, not just this
past Oscar’s season.
The first indicator that this is
uniqueisthecamerawork:rightfrom
the opening, where titular character
Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig)
discovers a young boy murdered in
the gas chambers, Mátyás Erdély’s
35mm cinematography focuses
directly on the face of Saul, whose
eyes sit dark and deep in his skull,
revealing the pain he has up to this
point endured and continues to
endure as the film progresses.
Throughout the film we rarely
glimpse anything further away than
a couple of meters from Saul’s face,
and director László Nemes shows
incredible constraint and vision
to resist capturing the production
values or showing the violent
atrocities that occur as he performs
the tasks forced upon him as a
member of the Sonderkommando
(prisoner work units at death camps,
made to assist the functioning of
the gas chambers) such as in the
opening scene where he is collecting
the clothes of murdered Jews. The
film follows Saul as he continues in
his attempt to bury the child, who
may or not be his son.
To tell this story, we go through
hell on earth, focusing on the
personal pain reflected in Géza
Röhrig’s face – the use of a 40mm
lens creates a claustrophobically
shallow depth of field that keeps
most of the nudity and murder
out of focus. Reinforcing this is
the decision to project the film in
the academy ratio, with the near-
square image further adding to the
oppressive atmosphere.
Additional credit must be given to
Tamás Záyni whose sound design
creates the world that is kept out of
sight: the screams of the people who
realise what their fate, the furnaces
in which the bodies are burnt – all
locations are given such horrifying
sound design that it is impossible
not to imagine what occurs just
beyond the frame, adding to the
immersion created by Nemes.
Son of Saul is edited phenomenally
by Matthieu Taponier, who creates
such a tense pace that there is never a
moment in which the film becomes
portentous. Rather, Saul’s singular
task of burying his son whilst in the
midst of a hellish atrocity becomes a
thrilling 107 minutes of cinema.
Of course, none of this would
matterunlessRöhrighadtheabilities
to carry the film. He undoubtedly
has such abilities. The essential
difference between film acting and
theatrical acting is the minutia,
something Röhrig completely
understands: each grimace and
look transcends whatever subtitles
flash at the bottom of the screen,
and in numerous profile shots he
seems to stare into the very soul of
Géza Röhrig brings incredible intensity to Son of Saul, described by Shoah director Claude Lanzmann as the ‘anti-Schindler’s List’. Photo Credit: Sony Pictures

Son of Saul stares into the abyss
The horror of the Holocaust is brought to life in László Nemes’ astonishing debut
the audience. In one particular shot
we see a smile slowly unfold upon
his face – it is shocking how simple
an image has stuck with me all of
this week, and a testament to the
subtlety and mastery of Röhrig’s
craft.
Although this is a film
about a Sonderkommando in a
concentration camp, it would be
a mistake to label this as just a
Holocaust drama; indeed, like all
best stories it seeks to transpose a
familiar human experience into the
setting of an unfamiliar landscape.
It is a story about how, in the
darkest times, the ache to embrace
traditions and to cling to them is
one of the most basic human traits
that exists. Whilst Saul and his
compatriots are treated as nothing
more than animals, the traditional
burial that he seeks for his son is
a goal that drives him to afford his
son one last shred of humanity in
an environment where this has been
taken from them.
Son of Saul is an experience like
no other. Yes, it is oppressively dark
(for obvious reasons), and yes, it
will haunt you. But it is a cinematic
experience like no other – one of
the most brutal depictions of the
Holocaust ever committed to film,
and one that should be experienced
in the cinema.

The top three
Superhero Films
that aren’t
Marvel
O
k guys, seriously now,
Disney is starting to
scare me. Now that
they own ESPN, ABC,
Lucas films, Pixar AND Marvel the
ludicrous amount of money they
make could, theoretically (and I’m
not saying this is a definite), fund
a pretty decent world domination
effort. I’m just saying. The only
way to stop this is to not give their
bloated superhero film franchise
any more money. Here are some
alternatives:
Watchmen (2009)
Based on the graphic novel
of the same name by eccentric
genius Alan Moore, Watchmen
demonstrates that Zac Snyder is at
least somewhat capable of making
a decent superhero film, despite
what his most recent offering might
suggest. Despite condemnation
from Moore himself (unsurprising,
he hates all adaptions of his books)
Watchmen actually manages to hold
up. It’s not perfect – or as clever
as the book – but its surprising
faithfulness to the source material
and gorgeous aesthetics make it a
fitting complement.
Hellboy (2004)
Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy was
my unchallenged favourite film in
primary school. It’s not your typical
superhero film, but its unique
‘del Toro’ nature is what makes it
stand out. Today, I consider both
the original and its sequel two of
the most underrated cult classics
of all time. I promise this isn’t just
nostalgia speaking… Ok maybe it is
a bit.
The Dark Knight (2008)
I don’t know why, but it feels a
bit weird putting this film on the
list. Everybody raves about it so
much that a lot of people are bored
of hearing about it. On the other
hand, including it makes my job
easier because I don’t need to do any
convincing. The Dark Knight is one
of the best films ever. Go watch it
again.

T
he struggle between
good and evil –
between superheroes
and supervillains – has
remained at the centre of the
Marvel Cinematic Universe (and
blockbusters in general) since its
inception in 2008’s Iron Man.
Without exception, the antagonists
of the eleven following Marvel films
have always represented the worst
of humanity (or super-humanity),
and the protagonists, while often
troubled, are always redeemable.
In this marketing-driven universe
there is rarely space for moral
ambiguity. The third film in the
Captain America trilogy, Captain
America: Civil War, escapes this
mold by pitting hero against hero in
a ‘war’over the controversial Sokovia
Accords which hope to establish an
international body to govern and
monitor superhuman activity.
The online marketing leading up
the release of the film asked fans
to decide whether they supported
#TeamCap or #TeamIronMan,
while posters had the two leaders
posed against each other, with their
supporters in the background. But
unlike the marketing campaign,
Captain America: Civil War
Dir: Joe Russo, Anthonay Russo.
Script: Christoper Markus, Stephen
McFeely. Starring: Chris Evans,
Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan,
Scarlett Johansson. 147 minutes.
the conflict the film presents is far
more complex: in 147 minutes of
superhero action and confrontation,
directors Anthony and Joe Russo
repeatedly challenge their audience’s
understanding of vigilantism and
the unintended destruction that
invariably follows, presenting us
with flashbacks to the Avengers’
careless destruction in previous
films.Like its comic source material,
Civil War is an allegory for military
intervention and war, and the
worrying lack of oversight that often
leads to death. Captain America
(Chris Evans) is a character that
has witnessed first-hand the evil
of the Nazis and Hydra, whereas
Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has
seen how Western intervention and
his own weapons sales can support
and create terror. It is these two
opposing experiences and views
that go head to head in Civil
War, verbally as well as physically,
through a number of key character
conversations. Viewers who have
watched from the beginning of
the series, and those that have any
understanding of history, are likely
to enter the theatre with a range
of opinions – but ultimately Civil
War never validates or invalidates
any of these. It’s final message is
ambiguous.
The film’s best trait is possibly
the success with which it juggles
its massive ensemble cast (the
cumulative result of a dozen
films). Veteran Avengers are given
the majority of the screen time,
although newcomers Black Panther
(Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-
Man (Tom Holland) are given fairly
lengthy introductions, and both
offer a refreshing variety to the cast
that goes beyond mere marketing
tools for future films (Marvel’s Black
Panther is set to be released in 2018
and Spider-Man: Homecoming in
2017). But with such a large cast
there is rarely time for character
development,and we are never given
an insight into how years of fighting
and unintended civilian casualties
have affected the emotional state of
the team – other than a few tears,
Captain America and his crew seem
largely unaffected. The film does
have the advantage of developing its
characters over the many adventures
that have preceded it and Civil War
is very much the culmination of
these storylines, but without the
context of previous films some parts
of Civil War are confusing, often
nothing more than fan-service.
Many critics noted the excellent
action scenes of the last Captain
America and they return on a larger
and more ambitious scale. Each
punch and kick of close combat is
delivered with crunching realism.
The larger battles, including one
that lasts over 20 minutes, use a
mixture of fantastical special effects
and witty one-liners to deliver some
of the best action audiences will
have ever seen in a comic book film.
However, the large cast can cause
confusion; it’s often hard to discern
who is on what side in the frenzy
of battle.
While easily forgiven, the film’s
soundtrack is largely forgettable
compared to other recent superhero
films like Deadpool or any of
DC’s output, and similarly the
cinematography is never more than
serviceable. You would hope that a
film with such a large budget and
audience might attract someone
with more interesting talent. While
I would argue that comic books,and
by extension comic book movies,
have never been about the scenery
in which they place their characters,
but that doesn’t forgive the lack of
effort. Artists pour most of their
time into designing lavish, eye-
catching costumes, and the outfits
of Civil War are suitably refined,
with new members of the ensemble
given a large amount of focus.These
costumes are often as much a part
of the film as the actors themselves,
and the new set of heroes on offer
will create new fans and ample
opportunity for merchandise and
product placement in the future.
In Civil War, the vastness of the
comic book canon is exploited to
full effect, with the best comic book
moments from decades of source
material composed together in a
truly unforgettable blockbuster.
It reflects the richness of the
comic book medium: the endless
reinvention, massive crossovers, and
ever-increasing spectacle. Captain
America: Civil War rewards fans for
their dedication, offering the best
Marvel film to date.
