The Bandeoke Experience is karaoke that has evolved into something far more exciting! Instead of
performing with a machine you have the opportunity to strut your stuff with a live professional
band! They’ll be performing alongside our headliner and student acts at
the Summer Ball on Saturday 18 June.
