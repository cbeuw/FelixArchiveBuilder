Imperial ranked the 3rd
most prestigious uni in Britain

mperial has been named the
university with the 3rd
best
reputation in the UK, and the
15th
best in the world.
This puts us down one place on
last year’s rankings,which was down
one from the year before.
This latest Times Higher
Education rankings system is based
on reputation, which is separate
to their world university rankings,
in which Imperial places 8th
in the
world and 3rd
in the UK.
As usual, Imperial’s British rivals
were Cambridge and Oxford, who
came 4th
and 5th
for reputation in the
world respectively, which is down
two places each on the year before.
They came after Harvard, MIT and
Stanford this year. Interestingly,
Cambridge beat Oxford for
reputation, despite the fact that in
the actual world rankings, not based
on perception, Oxford still trumps
Cambridge.
Arguably, a university’s brand is
important for attracting the world’s
best students and researchers, and
employers’perception of a university
is just as important when you’re
trying to get a job after graduating.
Although British universities
are well-represented, Durham and
Bristol had both disappeared from
the top 100. UCL came in just
behind us at 20th.Asian universities
saw the most dramatic improvement
in rankings, with the University of
Tokyo beating Imperial in 12th
place.
The rankings were created
after quizzing a panel of 10,000

academics from several different
countries, making judgements on
the reputation of each university.
The placing relied on these
academics’ perception of each
university’s teaching and research.
Each academic surveyed was asked
to name up to 15 universities that
they thought were the best in both
research and teaching. Scores for
these two categories were then
combined at 2:1 (research:teaching)
to give an overall score for each
institution. Each score was then
compared to the most commonly
named college (Harvard) to create
a ranking.

n a series of events that could
have come straight out of
a Glee episode, Imperial’s
male A Cappella group, The
Techtonics, managed to win first
prize at the finals of the international
competition for university A
cappella groups in New York. They
are the first ever British team to win.
The competition, made famous by
the film Pitch Perfect, was held in
The Beacon Theatre on Broadway.
Teams from North America and
the Europe competed in several
rounds of the competition to be
in with a chance of being one of
the ten groups to perform at the
final, which was featured on the
worldwide Snapchat story.

the night, but disaster nearly struck
when three band members got stuck
in a lift an hour before they were
due to perform.
On their victory, chair Will, said
that “trying to get the trophy back
on the flight home was nightmare”.
After qualifying for the
international competition after
winning the semi-finals that
were hosted here at Imperial, the
Techtonics attempted to crowdfund
their flights.
They were somewhat successful,
raising £565 of the £6000 they
needed for flights. They also used
profits from sales of their album to
raise the money.
The group will be attending the
Edinburgh fringe in August.
Laing O’Rourke awarded another Imperial
contract
The building contractor has already sponsored a centre in the Civil Engineering
Department
T
his week it was
announced that the
contract for the large
tower to be constructed
at the Imperial West campus will be
given to Laing O’Rourke.
The £76 million project will be
to build a 34-storey block that will
include 192 apartments, with 59
of those reserved for “Imperial key
workers”. According to college,
these flats for staff will be priced
below market rate.
This is the third project at the
White City Campus that has been
awarded to the firm. The contracts
for the two buildings that make up
the £200 million ‘Translation and
Innovation hub’ which is due to
be finished this summer, were also
given to the company.
Laing O’Rourke is the largest
privately-owned construction and
engineering company in the UK.
In 2010, it signed a deal with
Imperial to launch the Centre
for Systems Engineering and
Innovation, as part of the Civil
and Environmental Engineering
department, but it also has ties with
Mechanical Engineering and the

Geophysics sets students exam with answers at
the bottom
In a classic example of exam
season drama, first year geophysics
students were given a paper with the
answers at the bottom.
Students quickly realised the
error and told the invigilators, who
allowed the students to leave the
room without starting the exam.
The test, which took place on
the computers in the RSM, was
uploaded as a file that also contained
model answers.
It will be replaced by a coursework
module and is worth 6% of first year
marks for geophysics.
According to the department,
the decision to replace it with
coursework was taken after
“immediate discussions” with the
students who were due to sit the
exam. It is understood that the
coursework will assess the same
learning objectives.
Students were starkly warned not
to tell FELIX about the incident
and that it should stay “within these
four walls”, given the media interest
in similar incidents in the past.
Mishaps like this are not unheard
at Imperial. In 2014, a EIE first year
paper was handed out to students
with the model answers stapled to
the back. After giggles from the
room, the invigilators removed the
solutions, and allowed students to
continue with the test. The story
was covered by The Daily Mail.
Last year second year students in
the physics department were set an
impossible question in a Quantum
Mechanics exam, but were marked
on it anyway.
The geophysics department told
FELIX it would “of course review
procedures following discussions at
examiners’ meetings in June 2016”.
A college spokesperson told
FELIX: “It is a College priority to
adhere to the highest standards of
academic integrity, ensuring that
appropriate advice, support and
guidance are in place to support
students and staff. To this end
a steering group – part of the
Academic Standards Framework
- is reviewing assessment practices
and procedures across the College.
This incident will be taken into
consideration by the group as part
of their ongoing review.”

Business School. The centre hosts
several PhDs.
In 2013 the company also began
sponsoring an annual prize for final
year projects in Civil Engineering,
presented to one student a year at
graduation. This is set to continue
until 2018.
The new White City campus
represents a huge corporate step
for Imperial. The area will be
managed by the Imperial College
ThinkSpace, which will run office
and lab space for startups. The new
translation centre is being funded
by investors including Santander
Grace Rahman

and the Higher Education Funding
Council for England.
It will also house parts of the
Chemistry Department, but it is
still unclear which undergraduates
will be moving from the South
Kensington campus.
