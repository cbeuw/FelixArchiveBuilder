Documentary corner: Going Clear
Ben Collier
Writer
S
cientology is not exactly
the rarest documentary
topic. Countless attempts
have been made in the past
to expose various aspects of this
‘Church’ in the past – discussing its
history or telling the stories of those
who have left its ranks. Perhaps
the most famous documentary
prior to the release of Going Clear:
Scientology and the Prison of Belief
was the BBC Panorama’s Scientology
and Me. You’ve probably seen the
clip from this programme wherein
the host, John Sweeney, explodes
at church member Tommy Davis,
who managed to finally get under
his skin following months of
harassment. This is, unfortunately,
the usual way these documentaries
go: any journalist who has ever
tried to independently combat
and expose Scientology is quickly
met with stalking, harassment,
and lawsuits – some Scientology
members have even gone so far
as to plant child pornography on
reporters’ computers. Where the
HBO special Going Clear stands
out – other than the incredible level
of detail it goes into – is that it’s
quite hands-off. The presenter, Alex
Gibney, gives us his message almost
exclusively through the voices of
(very) high-ranking ex-members of
the church, such as Mike Rinder. I
think the backing of the behemoth
that is HBO had some part to play
in the fearlessness with which this
documentary tackles its subject.
Ultimately, Going Clear really
does serve as the only scientology
documentary you’d need to watch
to get a full understanding of the
movement.
Almost nothing is left out here:
we learn about Scientology’s history,
get a suitably in-depth exploration
of the mind of founder L. Ron
Hubbard, a revealing of its shady
underbelly, and even a study of
the two celebrity stars of the show,
John Travolta and Tom Cruise. A
focus on these two celebrities may
sound somewhat pointless at first,
but throughout the course of the
film one does begin to understand
the monumental impact they had
on popularising the church. Tom
Cruise in particular comes across
as an egotistical, Patrick Bateman-
esque character – he is very
chummy with the current leader
David Miscavige, a Machiavellian
figure who seems to be focused on
massaging Cruise’s ego in order
to keep him brainwashed and
dedicated. Based on the archive
footage, it’s possible to draw a
lot of parallels between Cruise
and Kim Jong-un: both appear
to be man-children surrounded
by insincere admirers, convinced
of their own self-importance. For
other celebrities involved in the
movement, one almost gets the
idea that they are trapped, possibly
blackmailed using the information
from their confessional ‘auditing’
sessions. Overall, Going Clear is the
most comprehensive and masterful
exploration of this topic I have
ever seen. Will its oddly specific
ranking as my ‘favourite scientology
documentary’ be toppled by Louis
Theroux’s upcoming documentary,
released later this year? We’ll just
have to see.
