FOOD
Seeding the Veggie Power
FELIX recieves a response to last week’s article from a morally minded vegetarian
T
he foodies, meat lovers
or simply punctilious
readers amongst you may
remember last week’s
article raising arguments for meat
consumption, or rather, for not
feeling guilty about it as long as you
accepted the responsibilities. And
I thought there would be nothing
better than hunting my friend’s
arguments by growing from them.
Please bear with me. I know, for
most of you, the “Veggie”in the title
put you off.But,if you’re an Imperial
student, it must be that you like
challenge, so take it as a challenge
and read the article until the end.
Let’s start from the beginning.
Yes, I am vegetarian. Love vegan
cuisine, too. And guess what? I have
eaten meat for most of my life, 18
years, which is about 90% – you
can do the maths in your own time.
Oh, and I love meat. A steak tartare
on a sunny summer day? I used to
crave them. That’s right, I just said
it. So just think about that whilst
you still believe I am a green hippie
trying to convince you that lettuce
is so much better than a beef burger.
I do actually think that, but that’s
another story.
you’re going to consume meat, you
need to accept where it came from –
a real, living, breathing animal that
was killed and butchered.” That’s
how it all started for me, a couple
of years ago. I realised something
just wasn’t right. I would cry seeing
someone slaughter an animal and
then feel perfectly emotionless –
and greedy – facing that roasted
lamb in my plate.
So I thought: ‘Eat what you could
handle alone’. That’s my motto.
Could I kill a lamb myself? No.
CouldIhookafish?No.Conclusion:
no meat for me. And I must say I
have never felt as serene and full of
integrity as I do now. Our ‘modern’
world has lost the connection
between the art of hunting – or
fishing, for that matter – and the
art of cooking, as consumerism led
to a lucrative manufacture industry.
Personally, I just could not handle
that huge lie I was concealing from
my own conscious under the veil of
the food chain supply, which made
it easier for reality to be distorted.
Still, I have milked cows. I have
made yogurt, even butter, and
collected eggs from the henhouse.
This partly explains why I don’t
feel guilty about having a wedge
of Tomme de Savoie from time to
time, or spreading some churned
butter on a slice of lightly toasted
sourdough bread topped with my
neighbour’s honey.
Oh, and I don’t live in a farm, for
the sceptics. Just so that you don’t
try to find yourself some excuses – I
live in a capital city,actually. I mean,
the point is not to indoctrinate you.
That would be a waste of time.It has
to be your choice, and choosing to
be vegetarian is more than just not
willing to kill unnecessarily, but it is
a great starting point.
There are a significant amount
of environmental factors that have
rooted the veggie power, as I like to
call it, even further, and one should
not underestimate the impact of the
cattle industry on climate change.
The intention here was to give you
some thoughts to grow on. Long
story short, be consistent with your
values. Be true to your morals, and
stick to them.
Even crazed communists can be vegetarians – it’s very inclusive group. Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons

Sweet potato curry
And to show you vegan cooking
can be easy, delicious and inspiring,
if not more so than any other kind,
here is a sweet potato, lentil and
coconut curry just for you. And no –
you will not be lacking protein!
This recipe is all about making it
to taste – use lime juice if you want
a sourer kick, or up the cayenne
for a warmer heat. Feel free to
add lemongrass, whole chiles or
anything in that vein – but as it’s
been requested by some readers,
this is a recipe with fewer than five
spices, so I’ll leave that up to you.
Of course, you could always add
some browned chicken breasts, or
some juicy prawns,but that wouldn’t
really be in the spirit of the dish! Try
it without, and see.
2 tbsp cooking oil- olive or
sunflower
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and
diced into 2cm chunks (~1kg)
1 tbsp of turmeric
1 tbsp of ground cumin
2 tsp of ground ginger
2 green cardamom
1 tsp cayenne
(or use pre-made garam masala
for the above 5 ingredients – about
2tbsp)
2 cloves garlic, finely diced
1 onion, white or red, sliced
500g green lentils, rinsed
2 tins coconut milk
2 tins diced tomatoes
2 cups green olives
salt, pepper
1 lemon – or a lime, see note
above.
Handful coriander leaves
Heat the oil in a large, high
sided pan – a casserole dish would
be ideal. Once hot, add the cubed
sweet potato and get it browning.
You want to caramalise each face of
the cubes, so stir them moderately
frequently.
When almost brown all over, add
the spices, garlic and onion. Sweat
them for a few minutes, and then
add the lentils, coconut milk and
tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, and
keep on a low heat for about 30
minutes, or until the lentils are
just cooked. If the sauce is now too
thick, thin it out with a few splashes
of water.
Finish the dish with the green
olives and the juice of a lemon,
before topping it with some fresh
coriander leaves. Serve with some
steamed rice.
Mango sticky rice
This is a perfect vegan pudding –
especially as alphonso mangoes will
soon be in season! If you want to
find some, make a trip to Southhall
for the best ones.
300g glutinous rice
1 tin coconut milk
3 tbsp sugar
pinch salt
2tbsp coconut cream
2 ripe mangoes
Soak the rice for 10 minutes in
excess water. Drain, and add to a
microwaveable bowl with water to
just cover. Clingfilm the top, and
microwave until tender – about ten
minutes.Bringtheotheringredients,
apart from the mango, to a boil and
pour over. Let it cool and then serve
with the sliced mango.
Reading last week’s article was
very inspiring, and people could be
surprised by it, but it does relate a
lot to vegetarians too. The ethical
debate that was raised is exactly the
reason why I chose to be vegetarian,
and which also explains why I am
not fully vegan. But let me explain
it to you, with my friend’s quote: “If
