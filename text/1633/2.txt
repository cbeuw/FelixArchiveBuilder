his editorial has been a
long time coming, and
I know you’ve all been
waiting for this: the
FELIX view on the Labour anti-
semitism row. Just kidding! I can’t
think of anything I’d want to give
my inexperienced view on less,
except maybe last week’s sex toy
review.
What do you get when you
combine controversial, emotive
articles (no, not the sex toys) with
exam season? Loads of angry
comments of course! Lord bless the
internet and its many dudes. I’m all
for debate friends; debate is content
and without content, I would cough
and splutter, then literally die. But,
when you insult writers (as a boy
arguing with me under a Facebook
status once said to me,“ad hominem
anyone?”, except he spelt it wrong)
or spew out and out hate speech
against religions or races, I have
to step in. Yes, that means your
comment is getting deleted, brave
anonymous commenter! You know
your argument is on point when

you’re too frightened to put your
name to it.
Nowadays, you do have to log in
to comment on articles.You can still
remain anonymous to other FELIX
website surfers, but our webmasters
will know who you are. You can still
up or downvote comments without
being logged in, so the people have
free reign to decide whether they
agree with you or not. So yes, you
can still post bile. But guess what?
In the last issue of term,I’m printing
all you dickhead’s photos on the
front page with a big caption that
says “LOOK HERE FUTURE
EMPLOYERS”.
I’m assuming the same keyboard
heroes that scour the online
comments calling me a slut with
pro-Muslim bias don’t subscribe to
my weekly leftie ramblings on page
two of the newspaper (unless you’re
just here for the cute picture of
me, of course!) but people do seem
concerned that their comments are
getting deleted. Censored, even. If
you attack our writers personally,
rather than for their arguments,

you’re getting deleted. Just like if
you went up to one of our writers
at the union, and shouted, “IT
REALLY SEEMS LIKE YOU
WENT TO STATE SCHOOL
BECAUSE YOU LIKE SEX AND
YOU’RE GOING TO REGRET
EVERYTHING YOU’RE
DOING YOUNG LADY”, they
would like, probably throw a drink
at you and you’d only have yourself
to blame.
