Remember what it was like to be starting at Imperial? Moving to
London and starting university can be a daunting prospect. So who
better to welcome new students to Imperial than existing students
who have lived through the same nerve-wracking experience?
Help us give our students the best possible welcome.
100% of volunteers said they would recommend the experience to a
friend!

The Sports Review is a joint project between Imperial College Union and
Sport Imperial, aiming to create a joined up, more effective and more
inclusive sporting offer at Imperial.
A student body consultation has highlighted a general push towards
enabling participation on a more casual basis, with major barriers
involving time, location, and capacity of facilities. We would love to hear
your feedback before consultation closes on Friday 13 May. To give us
your view about sports go to:
