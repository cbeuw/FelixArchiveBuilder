umans have always
looked up at the sky
in awe and fascination.
For thousands of
years we’ve searched for light and
guidance in its movements, while
hanging our fables and myths on
the celestial bodies like regal robes.
And little wonder – almost all of
the elements in our bodies are made
from cosmic stardust, spewed out
from the fiery bowels at the hearts
of stars billions of years ago. As the
astronomer and philosopher Carl
Sagan quoted famously, “We’re
made of star stuff.”
We’ve used the skies to navigate
lands and seas, to determine the
earth is round,to learn about Earth’s
physical history
For the past few centuries,
the development of science and
technology has accelerated our
understanding of the vast unknown
universe, its complex laws and
infinite horizons. With the
abundance of technology in our
lives we may take it for granted, but
landing a man on the moon was
no easy feat in the 1960’s. So why
haven’t we gone back? We answered
the call of the sea and promise
of distant lands, so why have we
run back to safety from when we
dipped our toes in the cold shores
of the cosmic ocean? We’ve made
and sent objects into space that
have now passed the edge of our
solar system – 12 billion miles away,
but human exploration has been
limited. Certainly there are massive
challenges to overcome in advancing
our technological capacity.
The greatest challenge of all
however, is money. In a world
where money is wasted for violent
objectives and polluting the delicate
ecosystems of our planet; exercising
our vast intellectual capacity, with
the potential to answer the deep
human drive for exploration is
largely ignored. In the US alone, the
2011 military budget was almost
$200 billion USD higher than the
entire NASA budget over 53 years
from 1958-2011. It’s disappointing
that we are not pressuring our
governments to increase funding for
this kind of awe-inspiring research,
to help us understand more and
more clearly our place amongst the
beautiful and mysterious bodies of
the cosmos.

technique which allows the culture
of ‘unculturable’ microbes in lab
conditions.
So far less than 10 million species
of microbes have been classified.
“Of those catalogued species,
only about 10,000 have ever been
grown in a lab, and fewer than
100,000 have classified sequences,”
Lennon said. “Our results show
that this leaves 100,000 times more
microorganisms awaiting discovery
-- and 100 million to be fully
explored. Microbial biodiversity,
it appears, is greater than ever
imagined.”

estimate said. Indeed in a rapidly
changing world undergoing another
mass extinction, identifying new
species is crucial.
Uncovering diversity on Earth,
has been a task many studies have
attempted. However past estimates
have either grossly fallen short
of the true magnitude of earth’s
diversity,or have completely ignored
microbial communities.
That’s not to say such approaches
were unjustifiable. Naturally
numbers of some species are
easier to calculate than others. For
example we know of approximately
5000 mammal species and the
likelihood of there being a large
hidden repository of undiscovered
mammals somewhere in the world
is highly unlikely. Additionally,
there is a positive relationship
between small body size and high
diversification rates, meaning that
groups of smaller organisms tend
to have more species. This is why
there are so many more invertebrate
species in comparison to mammals,
birds or even reptiles. At the same
time, the smaller the organism in
question, the higher the chance it
has been overlooked, which is what
makes microbial diversity especially
tricky to estimate.
“Until recently, we’ve lacked the
tools to truly estimate the number
of microbial species in the natural
environment,” Lennon points
out. “The advent of new genetic
sequencing technology provides an
unprecedentedly large pool of new
information.
The IU scientists used a
combination of microbial, plant and
animal community datasets from
a variety of sources and ecological
theory to create this new, rigorous
estimate. In total a mega-sample
of 5.6 million species from 35,000
locations across the globe was
compiled, from 35,238 distinct
efforts sampling everything from
bacteria, archea and fungi, to trees,
birds and mammals..
They suspected that aspects of
biodiversity would scale with the
abundance of individual organisms,
and indeed found a powerful trend
of biodiversity changes across scale
of abundance.
This estimate is coming at
an interesting point of our
understanding of microbial services.
For example recent studies have
shown that the human virome (the
community of viruses that are part
of our bodies microflora) may have
beneficial effects on our health. In
2014 it was shown that a strain of
Murine norovirus in mice, is more
than just a non-intrusive genetic
hitch hiker,but actually helps restore
damage done to the intestine and
immune system. More importantly
the virus is genetically transmitted
from parents to offspring, meaning
the benefits associated with carrying
the virus become genetic.
Another important service
microbes offer is acting as potential
sources of new meds. This becomes
particularly important if we think
about the progressing antibiotic
crisis. More and more infections
are developing antibiotic resistance
and becoming super-bugs. Last
September, a strain of Super-
gonorrhea started spreading
around Leeds. Last year, scientists
