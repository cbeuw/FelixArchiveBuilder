This week you realise that life
is just one great big RuPaul’s
Drag Race, with various
challenges testing your ability
to act,make people laugh and
create couture dresses from
fabric in a bin. If you can’t
love yourself, how the hell
you gon' love somebody else
can I get an amen up in here?

This week in the sunny
weather you decide to ditch
the 40 denier tights and go
bare legged. Unfortunately
you forgot to shave and a
man literally collapses and
dies from seeing a tuft of hair
on your knee.
This week you're finally
invited to a Women@
Imperial meeting, but you
are banned for life after
screaming YASSS QUEEN
and doing NUS hand waving
every time Alice Gast makes
a suggestion.
This week you get up bright
an early in order to vote and
exercise your democratic
right to decide what's best for
London.However,you realise
this isn't the Brexit one and
so you just scribble 'close the
borders' on your form before
screwing it up and throwing
it at a volunteer.
This week you’re Drake.
When girls you like are
leaving your album listening
party, you go up to them and
go,“Can I get a hug, though?”
This week you write an anti-
Israel article and you decide
to go into hiding in fear of
Mossad trying to get revenge.
I'm basically Salman Rushdie
if you think about it.
This week, to prepare for
a trip to Japan, you are
brushing up on your Japanese,
learning such phrases as ‘two
beers please’, ‘can I buy you a
drink’ and ‘do you keep your
contraception in the fridge?’
This week you are part of
a physical fight that breaks
out in the library cafe queue
between mild acquaintances
after arguing over who is
busier lately.
This week you don’t bother to
vote in the mayoral elections,
because the candidates are
basically the same, like my
two favourite videos – Avatar
and a vine of two drunk guys
dressed as smurfs fighting.
This week you start a physical
fight with someone in the
union who is insisting
that Beyonce’s Lemonade
soundtrack is not a cultural
phenomenon because it
attributes multiple writers.
This week in order to have a
more interesting sex survey
result to input, you decide to
try and have sex in the ethos
swimming pool; however,
you get locked in and have to
drink pool water. However,
the chlorine makes your hair
so shiny that every one you
meet wants to have sex with
you.
This week, when graduating,
you held up a sign reading:
"Hi Alice look I really like
you but I just haven't felt
the same since we took that
holiday together and to be
honest it's probably me rather
than you so no hard feelings
or anything and I hope we
can stay friends."
