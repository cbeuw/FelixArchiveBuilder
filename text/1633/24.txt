Trials and Tribulations at BUCS Sprint ‘16
Missing athletes, lost bikes and misdirection from marshalls
O
n Sunday 1st
May,
seventeen of Imperial’s
bravest triathletes
descended upon the
sleepy town of Calne, Wiltshire to
compete in the 2016 BUCS Sprint
Triathlon. Gathered outside SAF at
the ungodly hour of 5:45am, some
quick Imperial brains spotted that
there were actually only sixteen
recruits present;we were missing our
secret weapon, scholarship athlete
Alistair Wallace. A few panicked
phone calls later and it became clear
that he had slept through his alarm
and was not going to make the
rendez-vous. We departed one man
down, hoping that he would be able
to make his own way to the race.
The rest of the journey went
smoothly, even those in the bus
driven by Jonny “fast and furious”
Singh survived their trip relatively
unscathed. Once we had arrived
in Calne, the plan was simple. The
500 odd student triathletes would
be set off in half hour waves, with
the slowest swimmers starting first.
They would then complete a 750m
swim, 25km bike and 5km run as
quickly as possible.
Matt Douthwaite and club
captain Sam Jackson fearlessly led
the march into battle, setting off in
the first wave of the day. Despite
concerns from Luis, the TriIC swim
coach, about Matt’s abilities in the
pool, this runner-turned-triathlete
put in a solid performance and
was the first of the two out of the
pool. Once on dry land, Matt found
himself in much more familiar
territory, storming the bike and
run to finish second in his wave
with Imperial’s fastest run time
of the day. Meanwhile Sam was
having a slightly more eventful
race. His super quick first transition
turned out to be more hasty than
speedy as he realised part way into
the bike that he had failed to attach
his race number. Whilst zooming
past the marshals, hoping they
wouldn’t notice this omission, an
unfortunately placed speed bump
relieved the captain of his water
bottle as it flew out of his bottle
cage on to the other side of the
road. No longer weighed down by
these unnecessary pieces of kit, Sam
put in decent bike and run times to
finish solidly overall.
Next up were Lawrence Tse and
John Foden-Shroff competing in
wave number two. As some of the
few Imperial athletes to have already
competed in triathlons, Lawrence
and John managed to complete
their races with no mishaps, both
finishing with highly respectable
overall times.
These two were followed by the
third wave of Imperial triathletes
including Jonny Singh who had
somehow managed to find himself
setting off at the same time as
half the Imperial women’s squad.
He quickly overtook teammate
Lily Battershill in the pool before
putting in the fastest Imperial bike
time of the day to finish fourth out
of the Imperial men.
Sadly Lily’s race didn’t go quite as
smoothly. In the pool, the wayward
foot of a fellow (non-Imperial)
competitor connected with her
goggles to leave her with a shiny
black eye. She bravely soldiered on
to the bike, her strongest discipline.
Sadly, about halfway round the
course, she experienced a race-
stopping puncture. After a teary
twenty minutes spent sat by the
side of the road, she was rescued by
some passing cyclists who kindly
patched up her wheel and set her
on her way. She was massively
disappointed by this turn of events
but eventually cheered up, especially
after disappearing for a short time
in the afternoon to be consoled by
team mate Jonny.
Leanne Lyons and Anna Lawson
were having much more successful
races. Having recently joined
the triathlon club from running
backgrounds, they both put in
decent times on the swim and
bike but excelled on the run, each
completing the 5km in under 23
minutes, no mean feat after having
already been racing for over an hour!
The next Imperial triathletes to
set off were Edmund Jones, Alice
Spencer and Madeleine Whybrow.
Ed was the first of the three to
leave the pool but fell into a spot
of misfortune when one of his
aero bars fell off part way into the
bike, leaving him with a lopsided
aero position and very odd looking
handlebars. Not letting this faze
him, he completed a solid bike and
run time to finish fifth out of the
Imperial men.
Next to finish in the pool was
Alice but sadly her speedy swim
was not matched by the rest of
her race where she was left a little
disappointed by her bike and run.
Last but not least,Madeleine left the
pool, keen to put the swim behind
her to get on with her beloved bike.
True to form, she put down the
fastest bike time of the Imperial
women finishing solidly overall.The
next Imperial athlete to compete
was Marcel Admiraal, swimming
in a wave on his own. This was his
fourth BUCS Sprint Triathlon and
his experience served him well as
he completed a great race, scoring a
personal best in the process.
ThesixthwavecontainingImperial
competitors set off at midday and
featured Greg Jones and Freya Espir.
Despite being a very inexperienced
cyclist, Greg absolutely stormed all
three legs of the race, with notably
quick swim and run times. His bike
went less smoothly, however, as he
spent the first couple of kilometres
working out how to change down
a gear before taking a tumble after
an unfortunate encounter with a
roundabout at high speed. Despite
these upsets, he still put down a
great time, finishing third out of the
Imperial men.
Freya was having even more
trouble in her race. Slipping on a
corner on her way out of the pool,she
started the bike with a few injuries
but carried on regardless. However,
a missed turning and some dubious
directions from a marshal saw Freya
complete an extra 5km on the bike.
Impressively, she completed the rest
of the race although was obviously
a little disappointed with her time!
Up next was next year’s captain
and resident French heart-throb
Tom Bartissol. Despite a slow
second transition, during which
it took him several attempts to
complete the usually simple task of
putting shoes on,Tom’s overall time
was very impressive and he placed
a strong second out of the Imperial
men.
Last but not least,Alistair Wallace
and Jessica Prior were racing in
one of the final waves of the day.
Borrowed from the swimming club
for the weekend, Jess turned out to
be the true star of the day. Both
her run and swim were the fastest
of all the Imperial girls. However,
even more impressive was her bike.
Despite it being the longest distance
that she had ever cycled, she
smashed the 25km, beating most of
her teammates and bringing in the
fastest overall time of the Imperial
women. For Alastair,however,most
of the drama had taken place before
he had even reached the start line.
After missing the first checkpoint,
the experienced triathlete had
travelled to Wiltshire via train, bus
and taxi. All had gone smoothly
until he reached Calne, where he
realised that he had left his bike on
the train. After some negotiations
with the train company,his bike was
on its way back to London and he
was paired up with one of the club
bikes for the race.He went on to put
down strong swim and run times,
earning him a solid first place out of
the Imperial athletes.
Overall, the day saw some
promising performances from
a mostly inexperienced squad.
The team triumphed despite the
(numerous) mishaps and we are
already looking forward to the rest of
the triathlon season and the chance
to learn from our mistakes and to
improve on our performances.

first couple
of kilometres
working
out how
to change
down a gear
