Flying high with Imperial frisbee
The Imperial discDoctors swan through nationals
I
mperial’s Ultimate Frisbee
club, more commonly known
as the discDoctors (or dD)
were in a position to bring
both a women’s team and a men’s
team to nationals for the first time
ever, with the men having qualified
in the league throughout the season,
and the women finishing highly at
Outdoor Regionals qualifier back in
March.
Men’s 1st
Team
Nationals this year started with
dD taking on Heriot Watt who
took an early lead and never looked
back, with the game finishing 8-4
to Heriot – a typical dD start to a
tournament!
With much more now at stake
having lost the first game, dD came
out fighting against a Southampton
side that looked a little lacklustre at
times. dD capitalised on this with
great defensive and offensive play,
winning the game 10-1, sending a
big message to our next opponents
Liverpool.
This next game proved to be
very close, with both teams taking
the lead at different points, but it
was dD’s intensive defensive play
which won them the game 9-6, and
coming second in our pool.
This put us in a crossover with
Cardiff, which turned out to be a
game of two halves, dD took the
first half fairly convincingly 7-4,
however after half time, Cardiff
came out with some very strong
defence play which dD couldn’t
break, and Cardiff won the game
8-7.
This left us on Sunday with a
round robin against Southampton
and Sheffield for a place in the
plate final. With fewer players now,
dD knew both games would be
tough, particularly with a re-match
against Southampton who came out
fighting, however dD were able to
keep the intensity up and won 12-2
in the end. The Sheffield game was
very close, with the teams trading
points throughout,but dD came out
9-7 winners with great defence play
giving them the win.
This put us in the plate final
against Kent, a team we had beaten
13-4 previously in the season. With
a very small squad from injuries at
this point, dD knew it would be a
tough game. Everyone came out
fighting and gave it their all, with
dD playing incredibly well in windy
conditions to go 7-0 up, including
three upwind points! At this point
Kent came out fighting clawing the
game back to 7-4, however it wasn’t
enough as dD won 9-4.
The players can be very proud
of winning the division two plate,
showing the great quality that
we have in a squad with a mix of
vast experience and relatively new
players.
Women’s 1st
Team
The weekend started on a cold and
sunny Saturday morning, with the
women in a good position; seeded
2nd
in Div 2, and top of their group.
Their first game was against
Manchester, an enjoyable game and
an opportunity for the team to find
their flow. The final score was 11-1
to Imperial; a great start to weekend.
The second game was against
Cardiff, who although seeded at
the bottom of the group, proved
they certainly didn’t belong there
by fighting a tough fight against the
wind with some good catches in bad
wind. Imperial eventually worked it
down the pitch though to win the
game 6-3.
The final game of pool play was
against Sheffield Hallam, who also
put up a good fight. They came out
with a tight zone defence, and some
very safe catches that Imperial just
couldn’t quite beat and the women
lost 8-2. This meant that a tense
crossover game awaited against
Reading, which if lost would mean
the team could only finish as high as
8th
. It was a tight game, and points
were traded throughout, both teams
desperate to avoid being in the lower
bracket, but the women worked it
through the gaps in their defence
with every player contributing. It
ended with a tense universe point,
which Imperial won to leave them
in the top bracket.
Day two started slowly, as the
regret of too much pizza and the
consequences of sleeping on a cold
scout hut floor took hold, but the
women came out fighting against
Nottingham, the weekend’s hosts.
Unfortunately despite Imperial
finding their swing quickly and
playing some excellent offence,
Nottingham were just too strong
and won 11-5.
After watching the boys beat
Southampton (again), the girls were
ready to take on Southampton’s
women’s team. Once again a strong
performance gave the women a
10-4 victory.
The final game was against
Swansea where the wind picked up
and Imperial took the opportunity
to bring out their zone defence
which they’d been practicing all
weekend. It all came together and
Swansea just couldn’t compete.
Combined with some excellent
upwind points from Imperial, the
women took the final game 10-1, to
finish in 5th
place.
All in all an excellent weekend
for Imperial’s inaugural women’s
outdoor team, playing against some
tough teams but they came together
and played well as a team. MVP
went to Si-Ci Ong,and MIP to Poh
Hui Xian (Fish).
Many thanks must go to the
captains and coaches for enabling
both teams to play so well at this
level and to also bring on-board and
incorporate new players in the team.
The game
finished 8-4
to Heriot – a
typical dD
start to a
tournament!
