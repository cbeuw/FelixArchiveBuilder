I
mperial College has put
forward a team of twelve
students to compete in
the International SensUs
Competition,which aims to produce
a creatinine molecular biosensor
for healthcare applications. Its
applications include uses in
monitoring chronic kidney damage,
radiology, the cardiovascular system
and transplantation.
The other universities taking
part in the competition include:
The University of Leuven, Uppsala
University,The Technical University
of Denmark and Eindhoven
University of Technology. SensUs
is the first international student
competition involving molecular
biosensors for healthcare
applications, and is being organised
by students at the Eindhoven
University of Technology in
collaboration with professors from
international universities.
Creatinine is a by-product of the
phosphorylation of creatine and is
catalysed by the enzyme creatine
kinase. Kinases are enzymes which
use ATP (adenosine triphosphate,
the body's immediate supply
of chemical energy) to transfer
phosphate groups onto molecules,
such as creatine, turning ATP into
ADP (adenosine diphosphate).
The product of the reaction is
phosphocreatine which is used
to turn ADP back into ATP in
times of high physical stress;
phosphocreatine requires low effort
to synthesize when the body has
excess ATP.
Creatinine is useless to the body so
it has to be removed by the kidneys.
If the filtration in the kidneys is
deficient, the level of creatinine in
the blood rises. Consequently, by
sensing the concentrations, doctors
can determine kidney-associated
illnesses in patients. It is therefore a
very important compound and any
improvements to current sensors
will be a remarkable achievement.
The sensing of creatinine has four
main application areas: monitoring
chronic kidney damage, the study
of agents that are a burden on the
kidneys in radiology, the study of
the effects of diuretics on the kidney
in cardiovascular studies, and in the
monitoring of transplanted kidney
function as part of patient care.
Professor Tony Cass and
Doctor Christopher Johnson, the
supervisors of the Imperial team,
act as consultants to the Imperial
team and are able to provide
guidance to the team due to their
extensive knowledge in both
biochemistry, bioengineering and
molecular biosensors. Although
it is a student-only competition,
the team seeks help on any specific
problems encountered along the
way and liase with the supervisors
and various companies to attain
A very happy ensemble on a very successful trip! Photo Credit: SensUs Imperial
The team
aims to
produce
a fully
functioning
creatinine
sensor which
rivals those
currently
available
Imperial puts forward a team in an
international sensor building competition
any equipment or facilities needed.
Moreover, they have generously
contacted companies and are in
charge of the teams funding. One
company, OrionTM, has kindly
supplied free electrodes to the team
who are hoping to start working in
labs in the summer term.
The Imperial College team aims
to produce a fully functioning
creatinine sensor which rivals those
currently available. The Imperial
team is made up of five chemists,
John Welsh, Ana Losada, Ning
Voon, Onur Guzel, and Taiwo
Lawal, four bioengineers, Francesco
Guagliardo, Edward Da Fonseca,
Valeria Trujillo, and Riccardo
Barbano, a biochemist, Rufus
Mitchell-Heggs, mathematician,
Lawrence Stewart, and a physicist,
Thomas Lord.
The Imperial team is currently
conducting market research on
existing sensors by asking various
experts in the field including
clinicians, GPs and professors. They
will use the information gathered
to decide whether to improve on an
existing model, which uses enzymes
to detect the compounds in the
blood, or to go in another direction,
possibly researching the potential
use of molecularly imprinted
polymers (MIPs). However, it is
likely that they will split up into two
teams so that they can experiment
on both MIPs and enzyme-based
sensors.
The team will be travelling
to Eindhoven University of
technology in the Netherlands on
the 9th
of September to present their
sensor. Each sensor will be given
22 samples to be tested over three
hours on Friday and on Saturday,
the team will present their sensor
to the public and a panel of experts,
Professor Cass being one of them.
Four independent awards will be
given out by the end of Saturday:
The Analytical Performance Award,
based on the precision, range, speed
and sample volume; The Creativity
and Initiative Award, based on
how original the sensor is; The
Translation Potential Award, based
on future applications in healthcare
and how cost-effective it is; and The
Public Presentation Award, based
on the presentation skills of the
teams.
While it would be an amazing
achievement for the team to win
an award, they are simply happy to
have made a functioning sensor and
contributed to the scientific field.
