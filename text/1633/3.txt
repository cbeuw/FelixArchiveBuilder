Students sign up to three year £125,000 housing
contract by accident
They didn’t realise they couldn’t sublet the place
T
his week, college is
coming to the aid of
three Imperial students
who accidentally signed
a three year tenancy agreement for a
flat on Queen’s Gate that they can’t
afford.
The house, which has three
bedrooms, was advertised at £800
per week in total, which amounts to
a hefty £267 per student per week in
its current state.
Their intention was to sublet the

dorable or terrible? At
Wednesday’s postgraduate
graduation ceremony a student
who, judging from his gown,
had just completed a PhD, proposed to his
girlfriend onstage at the Royal Albert Hall.
Cameras are set up that project close ups of
those crossing the stage up onto a screen
behind it for the audience to see. After
shaking hands with the President, each
student has their moment in the sun, where
their post-graduation faces are shown on
the big screen for all to see. Some choose to
smile embarrassedly, while braver students
will dane to do a thumbs-up or peace sign.

reading back through the contract,
they realise they are not allowed to
sublet, and so are trying to get out
of the deal.
The landlord, who lives in New
York, has already charged them the
first month’s rent upfront, which
amounts to around £3500.
The students found the house,
which has two bedrooms and one
large reception room, via Foxtons
estate agents.
They run the risk of getting sued if
they don’t pay up, since the contract
is a legally binding document. Their
situation is made all the more urgent
by the fact that some of the students’
study visas could be in danger.
To add insult to injury, the flat is
unfurnished.
Imperial Student Hub is believe
to be helping the students try and
get out of the contract. The Hub’s
manager told FELIX that landlords
and letting agents often tell students
that other groups are looking at the
property to pile up the pressure to
sign.They also said it was “extremely
important” to read and understand
the contract and that students can
bring their contract into the Student
Hub if they want it checked over.To
avoid the situation these students
have got themselves into, it’s also
worth asking for a break clause, so
you can stop the lease early if need
be.
“It’s a catch-22 nightmare,”one of
the students told FELIX.
When asked what advice they
would give students to avoid
getting into similar trouble, one
said, “I would tell them to talk to
their parents before making big
decisions.”
