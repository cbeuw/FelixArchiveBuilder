Civilization - Call to Power (PC)
Activision
Those o f y o u w h o w e r e a w a k e a c o u p l e
of issues a g o will r e m e m b e r that I
reviewed a g a m e called A l p h a Centauri,
a n d rather rashly called it t h e best g a m e
I'd ever played a n d that if another g a m e
c a m e a l o n g this year w h i c h c o u l d c o m -
pete with it, I'd strip n a k e d a n d d a n c e
around d a Vinci's w h i p p i n g myself with
a metre length of coaxial cable. O r s o m e -
thing like that. O u r b e l o v e d G a m e s Edi-
tor says I did, a n d h e wouldn't lie, w o u l d
he?
Anyway, he s e e m s to think I might
have to m a k e g o o d o n m y p r o m i s e , as
he's given m e a c o p y o f t h e official Civ2
follow-up to review. Civilisation - Call to
Power is Activision's first crack at this leg-
endary g a m e since they b o u g h t Micro-
prose a year or so a g o , a n d they are
doubtless h o p i n g for a repetition o f t h e
kind o f success that s a w t h e original
Civilisation installed o n millions o f hard
drives across t h e g l o b e . It's still not offi-
cially Civ3 - w e ' r e g o i n g t o h a v e t o wait
a bit longer for that - but Is m o r e a sort
of Civ2-and-a-half, a n indication o f t h e
kind o f concepts they will b e w a n t i n g to
develop in t h e official f o l l o w u p .
Unlike A l p h a Centauri, Civilisation -
Call to Power (or CivCTP

to all o f y o u w h o have
played any o f the p r e c e d i n g Civ g a m e s .
You d o this by f o u n d i n g cities, raising
taxes a n d d i v e r t i n g t h o s e taxes into
r e s e a r c h i n g t e c h n o l o g i e s . O n c e y o u
h a v e t h e s e n e w t e c h n o l o g i e s , y o u
develop n e w and better clubs with which
to hit your e n e m i e s a r o u n d t h e h e a d

d e v e l o p your cities, build W o n d e r s of
the W o r l d a n d general ly m a k e your
e m p i r e o n e to rival, well, your rivals.
O n e o f t h e biggest p r o b l e m s faced
by a n y g a m e s d e v e l o p e r w h e n devising
the follow u p to a g a m e like Civ is w h e r e
to take it. Sid Meier widely e x p a n d e d the
diplomatic side o f t h e g a m e , but Activi-
sion have instead o p t e d for increasing
the military side o f t h e g a m e . Normally
this w o u l d just m e a n a d d i n g a f e w n e w
units, t w e a k i n g t h e old units a n d h o p i n g
for the best, but Activision, to their credit,
have introduced a tactical e l e m e n t to
the gameplay. In all the previous versions
of Civ (including A l p h a Centauri), combat
was basically a matter o f gathering a pile
of units, a n d then throwing t h e m against
your e n e m y ' s pile until o n e o f t h e piles
w a s r e d u c e d to dust. In CivCTP, a little
screen c o m e s u p w h i c h s h o w s t h e t w o
a r m i e s f a c i n g e a c h
other, a n d then enables
y o u t h e player to select
w h i c h o f your units is
g o i n g to attack which of
your enemy's units. The
i d e a is a n interesting
o n e , but isn't i m p l e -
m e n t e d e n o u g h to
m a k e any real advance
in terms of t h e game's
payability. There's a g o o d a r g u m e n t for
a d d i n g a tactical c o m b a t e l e m e n t to Civ,
but it needs to be far m o r e flexible than
it Is here. Currently it just feels like a
m o m e n t a r y (and ultimately rather annoy-
ing) distraction f r o m t h e m a i n business
of t h e g a m e .
The most obvious difference is t h e
graphics. At a cursory glance, t h e inter-
face has m u c h m o r e in c o m m o n with
A g e o f Empires than with Civ2 or A l p h a
Centauri. The units are far better defined
a n d a nima te d than both Civ2 a n d A l p h a
Centauri, a n d it is certainly m u c h easier
to s e e w h a t is w h e r e than in cither o f
those two. The city m a n a g e m e n t screens
have also b e e n significantly altered, a n d
are m u c h clearer than those in Civ2 or
A l p h a Centauri. Unfortunately this clear
up has resulted in a loss o f information,
particularly in terms o f t h e city's p r o d u c -
tion capabilities, a n d this limits the range
of options available to y o u . This is unfor-
tunate, as part of the attraction of Civ w a s
the flexibility y o u h a d in controlling t h e
manufacturing base of your empire, a n d
in r e m o v i n g t h e city production infor-
mation, Activision have r e m o v e d a fair
portion o f that control.
The t e c h n o l o g y tree has b e e n
e x p a n d e d , particularly at the top e n d o f
the tree. In Civ2, the last definite advance

w h i c h give y o u specific advantages that
e x p a n d your options a little bit.
Activision's aims are fairly clear - they
w a n t e d to i m p r o v e o n t h e military side
o n Civ, s o m e t h i n g that c o u l d benefit
f r o m a little attention - a n d they should
be a p p l a u d e d for their attempt to update
the series in this respect. However, by
concentrating so m u c h o n the military
side, they have w e a k e n e d t h e g a m e as
a w h o l e . CivCFP is a fine piece of soft-
ware, a n d is definitely t h e equal o f A g e
of Empires (albeit t w o years younger), but
they have limited t h e options available to
the player so m u c h that if y o u c o m p a r e
it to t h e possibilities that reside within
A l p h a C c n t a u r i , p l a y i n g CivCTP feels
rather like playing in a straitjacket at
times. It's sad, but I can't h e l p w i s h i n g
that Sid M e i e r still h a d control over t h e

Shogo Shootout - The European Finals

Elite S h o g o players w e r e b r o u g h t

Microids to the sacred area k n o w n as the
Playing Fields - actually a subterranean
cyber g a m e s cafe just b e h i n d Warren

out for t h e title o f European C h a m p i o n
- a n d for t h e m o n e y , a cool 100,000 Yen
(500 o f your cnglish pounds).
For those not paying attention Shogo

shooter. Passing over t h e normal shot-

The Brits were there in force with five
of t h e six Finalists only having to brave
transport as far as Lancashire. The C o n -
tinentals w e r e only represented by a
French c o m p e t i t o r (the Italian
d r o p p e d out at t h e last minute).
The frantic fighting t h r o u g h the
six c h o s e n battlefields left h u n d r e d s

there w e r e n o civilian attrocities a n d
