The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
Sports Fields On Rocky Ground
A leaked copy o f College's Capital Invest-
ment Plan for the next five years confirms
that a major "rationalisation" o f Imperial's
sports grounds will have to take place
next s u m m e r . Ostensibly, this has b e e n
in preparation for s o m e time (see Felix
1136), but t h e report s h o w s that it is
n o w a necessity, w h i c h will provide cru-
cial funding for the proposed Sports C e n -
tre redevelopment.
According to t h e report, w h i c h w a s
passed by the last m e e t i n g o f the College
Council, the total cost o f t h e Sports C e n -
tre project is estimated at £9 million, o f
w h i c h £3 million will c o m e f r o m "the
m o n e y a c h i e v e d t h r o u g h t h e rationali-
sation of t h e College's sports grounds",
f o l l o w i n g t h e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s o f a
recent Athletics C o m m i t t e e study, w h i c h
s h o w e d that w e currently have a r o u n d
twice as m u c h space as w e actually n e e d .
As Estates M a n a g e r Nick Black put it,
"we have o n e o f t h e largest University
estates in t h e UK... if w e w e r e starting
with a clean sheet today, w e w o u l d prob-
ably build 3 0 % less space. T h e sports
centre at South Kensington is m u c h t o o

small, yet in contrast w e have four out-
d o o r sports g r o u n d s w i t h a b o u t 73
hectares in total, which is roughly d o u b l e
w h a t w e will ever need". In order for t h e
project f i n a n c e s to b a l a n c e , t h e sale
must c o i n c i d e with t h e b e g i n n i n g o f
building work, a n d the report goes o n to
pinpoint t h e "release" at July next year.
Whilst t h e Investment Plan d o c s not
explicitly state w h i c h g r o u n d will b e sold
- a n d Sports Centre M a n a g e r Frank M u r -
ray is at pains to point out that, at present
"all g r o u n d s are included in t h e review...
any c o m m e n t w o u l d be unsubstantiated
speculation" - a quick look at the figures
w o u l d s e e m to point t h e axe squarely at
T e d d i n g t o n . If t h e target figure o f £3
million is to b e a c c o m p l i s h e d , then only
the sale o f t e d d i n g t o n or Harlington will
suffice, as t h e c o m b i n e d value o f Col-
lege's other t w o g r o u n d s - Warren Farm
(in Ealing) a n d C o b h a m (near Kingston)
- is far less than t h e target figure. M o r e -
over, with a l o n g s t a n d i n g offer already
believed to b e o n the table (the o l d p e o -
ples h o m e w h i c h b o u g h t a small area o f
the T e d d i n g t o n site s o m e years a g o is
r u m o r e d t o have a continual interest in
expanding), a lucrative sale w o u l d b e
easy to arrange.
Reaction to the p r o p o s e d sale has
b e e n mixed. Understandably, it will face
stiff o p p o s i t i o n f r o m ICSM, w h o v i e w
T e d d i n g t o n as o n e o f their traditional
h o m e s (the g r o u n d itself w a s given t o
the St Mary's M e d i c a l School t o provide
a base for its rugby team); e n d i n g Ted-
d i n g t o n ' s status as a p r e m i e r r u g b y
g r o u n d w o u l d also face stiff o p p o s i t i o n
from traditionalists, as the g r o u n d w a s
o n c e the h o m e o f England, a n d t h e orig-
inal pavillion w a s t h e site o f t h e signing
of t h e RFU charter. Senior figures in ICU,
h o w e v e r , w o u l d a p p e a r t o v i e w t h e
move as a unavoidable loss which will b e
massively o u t w e i g h e d by the benefits
that the n e w sports centre will offer. N o t
so Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
elect Tim Trailor, however, w h o is stick-
ing by his election promise to back keep-
ing Teddington, even if it means delaying
the sports centre r e d e v e l o p m e n t .
Despite t h e fact that in senior Col-
lege circles t h e sale is apparently seen as
"inevitable", M r Murray is keen to point
out that t h e exact s h a p e of future sports
provisions is still unclear, with his depart-
ment currently "investigating all options
o p e n to the C o l l e g e to rationalise sports
g r o n d provision... these i n c l u d e d t h e
possibility that an entirely n e w ground b e
f o u n d closer t o t h e College t o replace
o n e or m o r e o f o u r existing facilities".
Indeed t h e onc-big-ground concept is a
particular favourite o f M r Murray's, a n d
is yet another reason w h y T e d d i n g t o n is
far m o r e likely to b e sold than C o b h a m ,
as t h e former offers n o s c o p e for expan-
sion, w h e r e a s t h e latter could potentially
b e c o m e a very large site v i a t h e pur-
chase of t h e playing fields currently used
by GKT M e d i c a l School (they t o o are in
the process o f rationalising sport provi-
sion, a n d a sale is expected to take place
soon).
S o u t h s i d e Barred
Residents o f Southside halls c a m e b a c k
f r o m the Easter holidays to find m a n y o f
their w i n d o w s h a d b e e n barred. T h e

The m o v e w a s a response to various
incidents over t h e last f e w years, a n d in
particular last term, in w h i c h nearby res-
idents have suffered near-misses f r o m

Hellard a n d t h e Director o f Estates, Ian
Caldwell, w a r n i n g a b o u t t h e d a m a g e
d o n e to the college's reputation by such
action.

There are p r o b l e m s with the action,
however. The r o o m s in question tend to
o v e r h e a t , particularly at this t i m e o f
year. T o c o m b a t this fans have b e e n
installed in all of the affected rooms. I ur-
t h e r m o r e , a l t h o u g h t h e o p e n i n g o f t h e
w i n d o w s has b e e n severly restricted,
there is still a large e n o u g h g a p to throw
objects out of: Dr Hassard a g r e e d , c o m -
m e n t i n g "I h o p e p e o p l e don't test it
out". These p r o b l e m s , c o u p l e d with a n
apparent lack o f student consultation
c o n c e r n i n g t h e s c h e m e , have raised
d o u b t s as to the justification a n d effec-
tiveness o f t h e idea. O n e student c o m -
m e n t e d "we have d o n e nothing, but are
b e i n g b l a m e d anyway. It m a k e s y o u
w i s h y o u lived in your o w n flat."
While d e n o u n c i n g those w h o threw
items out o f hall w i n d o w s , a n action h e
f o u n d "totally i n c o m p r e h e n s i b l e " , Dr
Hassard e x p r e s s e d c o n c e r n over col-
lege's motives,- "I h o p e n o one's imply-
i n g o u r s t u d e n t s can't b e t r u s t e d " .
W h e t h e r or not they are t o b l a m e , it
a p p e a r s that it is Southside residents
that are b e i n g p u n i s h e d .
