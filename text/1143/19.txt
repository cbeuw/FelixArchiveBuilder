Can Man Utd do the treble?
As the football season w i n d s u p for this year, t h e question o n everyone's m i n d s is can M a n c h e s t e r United to the u n p r e c e d e n t e d treble - that is w i n the FA Cup, Ihe Pre-
miership, a n d , perhaps biggest o f all, t h e European cup. Here is a quick look at w h a t they will have to d o if they want l o s u c c e e d .
LEAGUE FA CUP EUROPEAN CUP
While Arsenal were busy thrashing M i d d l e s b r o u g h 6-1 at the Riverside, M a n Utd could
only draw with Leeds. This left Arsenal t o p o f the league with M a n Utd a point behind
in s e c o n d .
Chelsea could only draw with Sheffield W e d n e s d a y a n d Leicester, a n d after los-
ing in t h e Cup-Winner's c u p s e m i final, it looks like b e i n g a fruitless season for the
West Londoners.
Looking at t h e remaining matches, it is clear that Arsenal have t h e tougher task,
with h o m e matches against Derby a n d Aston Villa, as well as a trip to Leeds a n d a
tough North L o n d o n derby with T o t t e n h a m , a n d ex-manager G e o r g e G r a h a m .
United hardly have a m u c h easier task, facing Villa at h o m e before taking o n Liv-
erpool, Blackburn a n d M i d d l e s b r o u g h away, a n d finishing u p with Spurs at Old Traf-
ford.
Manchester United look to be favourites, however, although Alex Ferguson m a y
be tempted t o rest players for fear o f risking injury with t h e e n d o f season Euro-
pean C u p Final. That will b e Arsenal's c h a n c e to get in a n d pick up g r o u n d o n Utd.
It is interesting that both T o t t e n h a m a n d A s t o n Villa are both involved a n d could
help dictate t h e destination o f t h e title. Arsenal fans will b e particularly incensed
if their t e a m loses t o a I o t t e n h a m side m a n a g e d by t h e Arsenal revered G e o r g e
Graham.
Felix prediction: Arsenal not quite strong enough. Man Utd - Just

Man Utd v Newcastle Utd
The first time ever that t w o Uniteds have
met in t h e final o f t h e oldest c u p c o m -
petition in the world, a n d it s h o u l d be a
g o o d encounter. With o n e eye o n t h e
E u r o p e a n c u p final t h e f o l l o w i n g
W e d n e s d a y , Alex Ferguson is likely t o
rest Nicky Butt a n d possibly D w i g h t
Yorke/Andy Cole a n d Peter S c h m e i c h e l .
It has long b e e n k n o w n that t h e Euro-
pean c u p is the trophy h e truly desires.
Newcastle manager Ruud Guillit will
be h o p i n g that D u n c a n Ferguson will
have returned to partner Alan Shearer in
attack, but his side will have to improve
significantly o n their performance in the
semi-final defeat o f T o t t e n h a m . Their
defence, in particular, is looking a bit sus-
pect.
However, t h e match will likely b e
fairly o p e n with Ferguson resting s o m e
players a n d therefore making the teams
m o r e even.
Felix prediction: D r a w 1 -1

Bayern Munich v Man Utd.
to b e played at N o u c a m p Stadium,
Barcelona
The key to this match for U l d is Ryan
Giggs. Following his brilliant goal against
Arsenal a c o u p l e o f w e e k s a g o , Fergu-
son will look to h i m to provide the play
m a k i n g - especially with attacking mid-
fielders Roy Keane a n d Paul Scholes sus-
p e n d e d . United s h o u l d really be up for
this match as t h e a t m o s p h e r e in t h e
N o u c a m p s t a d i u m is unlike a n y other.
Bayern have a bit o f a reputation for
b e i n g a bit like G e o r g e Graham's Arse-
nal - they play for the result a n d are thus
usually fairly dull. N o n e o f their players
particularly stand out, apart f r o m t h e
e x p e r i e n c e d Lothar M a t t h a u s at
s w e e p e r .
This has t h e potential to be a great
m a t c h , with both t e a m s in their first
European final for over 20 years.
Looking into my crystal ball I can see Alex
Ferguson's d r e a m at last being realized.
Felix prediction: Man U t d win 2-0
