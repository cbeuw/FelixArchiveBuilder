Heart * * * * *
Starring : Christopher Ecclestone, Kate Hardie, Rhys Ifans, Saskia Reeves
Director: Charles McDougall
A
powerful psychological thriller
about obsession, lust, and dan-
gerous relationships, Heart is
brought to life by Jimmy McGovern's
distinctive style, with dark humour
and a fast, energetic script compli-
mented by strong performances. If
you liked Cracker then this dramatisa-
tion will intrigue you.
There are only four main charac-
ters to focus on and all their faces are
very familiar. Eccleston is Gary Ellis
whose sexual jealousy of his wife -
Hardie - drives him to a heart attack.
Whilst Ecclestone is trapped in a wheel-
chair, his wife embarks on an affair
with writer Ifans, and he begins to
believe that only a heart transplant
can save their marriage. T h e other
main character is Reeves, the mother
of the dead heart donor, and she is
undeniably abnormal. The death of
her son has devastated her, and meet-
ing Gary gives her life a new meaning.
The highly charged sexual and emo-
tional encounters between these four
leads to violent deaths and disturbing
outcomes.
Heart is very fast moving with over
13
Christopher Ecclestone.- One of Britain's finest actors.
200 scenes compared with the nor-
mal 90-odd in your average 90-minute
film. This gives the effect of a percep-
tible roller-coaster ride. It is also visu-
ally distressing so don't go and watch
this film on your o w n especially if
you're squeamish.
Heart deals with strong emotions
and is totally fanatical - this amazing
British film should only be missed in
exceptional circumstances. Q

Win tickets to The Waterboy with the
KENSINGTON
Enjoy mere's Something About Mary and
The Wedding Singer ? Well, expect more
of the same from The Waterboy, which
fuses Adam Sandler's bizarrely engaging
features onto the kind of dumb-ass com-
edy that's currently all the rage in the
States. It's hardly the stuff of classics - San-
dler plays the titular minion, who rises
from his lowly position to become a
national celebrity - but it's apparently incred-
ibly funny, and has gone down a storm in
the US. For your chance to find out why,
simply answer the following question:

Antz
After twelve months in operation, Steven
Spielberg's Dreamworks studio seemed
to be in big trouble, thanks to a couple
of flops and floundering finances. A
year later, its cemented its place as one
of Hollywood's big boys, thanks in large
part to a new approach to animation,
under the leadership of ex Disney hon-
cho Jerry Katzenberg. Leading the way
was Antz, their superior all star bugs-ln-
peril flick which beats Disney's technical
superior A Bugs fife by miles, thanks to
good gags aimed at kids and adults
alike - I'm guessing that Disney proba-
bly Wouldn't contemplate casting Sharon
Stone and Woody Allen in lead voice-
over roles. Cartoon fun the way it ought
to be.
Les Miserables
Great cast: Liam Neeson, Geoffrey
Rush, Claire Danes, UmaThurman. Great
novel: adapted from Hugo's original,
without any of the annoying singing we
now all associate with the name Les
Miserables. Great movie? No. The power
of the novel seems to have gone miss-
ing somewhere in the search for sump-
tuous costume drama styllngs, so whilst
It certainly looks nice - and opens up the
book to a far wider audience - it falls far
short of what it could have been.
Nonetheless, it's a competent, well-
acted adaptation, with a timeless story
at its heart.
Fear & Loathing
in Las Vegas
Terry Gilliam, Jonny Depp and
Hunter Thompson bfought together in
one movie. You expect extreme w e l l -
ness - and Fear & Loathing delivers in
spades. Psychedelic effects, incompre-
hensible trains of action and thought;
more drugs than the mind can com-
fortably imagine; and wall-to-wall
strangeness. Basically, if you can follow
this movie, then you're either stoned or
schizophrenic. So is it any good? Well, I
guess that's going to be a very personal
decision - however, whatever your feel-
ings, it's definitely something that should
be seen o n the big screen - Gilliam
directs with every inch of the screen in
mind, so a 21" screen simply won't do
it justice.
