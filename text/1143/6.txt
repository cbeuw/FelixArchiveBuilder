ICSM Summer Ball
Dear Felix,
T h e lead article o n 26/4/99 in Felix
c l a i m e d that there is a sour relationship
b e t w e e n t h e IC a n d ICSM S u m m e r Ball
Organisers a n d that they are in fierce
competition. From m y point o f view, that
is not t h e case at all a n d there is no n e e d
for a n y animosity at .all. T h e ICSM S u m -
mer Ball is o n t h e 24th of June to co-ordi-
nate with Exam results a n d not to spark
any c o m p e t i t i o n for ticket sales. O u r ball
is for ICSM, it is a i m e d at M e d i c a l Stu-
dents, w e are advertising only in t h e
hospital a n d t h e BMS, h o l d i n g it at a
M e d i c s v e n u e a n d following t h e tradi-
tions o f a l o n g long history o f St Mary's
a n d C h a r i n g Cross S u m m e r Balls. I
believe I speak for t h e majority o f M e d -
ical Students in saying that if they are
going to a s u m m e r ball it will be the ICSM
event. T h o s e first years, t h e only stu-
dents based at IC, w h o regard t h e m -
selves as part o f t h e M e d School will
join t h e rest o f us o n 24th o f June, those
w h o don't, won't a n d I d o believe they
are t h e only g r o u p with a decision to

I don't think we claimed there Is a sour
relationship - merely that It Is a "con-
tentious Issue". This Is true, as your letter
makes It quite clear that first years medics
have "a decision to make", and obviously
both balls would like their patronage. As
the balls are so close together. It's
unlikely many will go to both (which Is
not the same as saying the unfortunate
timing is deliberate). Both Presidents
agree and accept that most medics will
go to ICSM's, except maybe first years.
"First years... who regard themselves as
part of the M e d School" will go to the
ICSM ball - does this mean that those
medics who choose to go to the IC ball
instead are not, in your view, 'faithful'
members of ICSM? - Ed

w o u l d s o m e o n e take t h e trouble to write
a letter like that a n d deliver it to t h e Felix

that doesn't work! I'm told there w e r e

I c a n only draw t w o logical c o n c l u -
sions a b o u t y o u :
1. Y o u are a b u n c h o f sad, lonely,

break their hearts, y o u nasty rodents

2. Y o u are a girl w h o has fallen for

to carry o n with this o n e b e c a u s e that
kinda stuff h a p p e n s in m y dreams, after
studying at Imperial for nearly t w o years
I k n o w it ain't g o n n a h a p p e n for real! I
m e a n , there's a little bit o f m e h o p i n g
that its true but look at it f r o m m y point
of v iew a n d you'll understand w h y I don't
believe a single t h i n g y o u wrote!
I have called in m y network o f spies
