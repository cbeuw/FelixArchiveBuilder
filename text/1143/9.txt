Clocks Defy Physics
A strange p h e n o m e n o n has been
observed in the Huxley (physics) build-
ing over the Easter period. Clocks in
public areas all over the building which
have previously always been reliable,
and could always be d e p e n d e d upon
to show the correct time have been
noticed behaving strangely.
Some clocks have stopped, show-
ing various times, and others are Just
plain wrong. Many explanations have
been put forward, including the
sequence of power outages that have
recently affected the building. Which
is much more plausible than one of
the alternatives - Imperial physicists
working on the challenge of making
time travel a reality have made a break-
through in their research.

DoC's Secret Printer
If you've got time on your hands and
you are in front of a
computer, take a look at
http://amber.doc.ic.ac.uk
It is... well.. I would
describe It as a printer,
but it describes its self
on its website as a com-
plete document centre.
As well as being a com-
plete publishing
machine, it also insists
on setting itself up as a
webserver when
attached to a network.
The device's status,
and settings (now
password protected)
are all available online,
as is the option to print a test page
or 99. This Xerox-made monster is a
printer / copier / stapler / fax / scanner
and is apparently situated in DoC,
although last time I looked it was
apparently unsure of it's precise loca-
tion.

A Mostly Harmless Column by needing a break
from long days
Kevin, a random entity who spent revising in
the Library over
knows nothing about nothing the "holidays". The
g a m e involves
three to five people, passing a ball or
beanbag between them, trying to keep
it in the air for as long as possible.
T h o u g h almost inanely simple it
appears to be providing effective stress
relief for its participants.
The increasing popularity of the pas-
time Is reflected by the growing area
which is now used incorporating the
area between Sherfield and the
Q u e e n ' s Lawn, as well as the area
where it originally appeared, directly in
front of the Library.
Biochemistry Breakfast
Cereal
If you have ever walked past the bio-
chemistry department and been per-
plexed by the delivery of crates of
breakfast cereal. Kevin will now
enlighten you, the best medium for
growing fungi in today's world of mod-
ern biochemical research, is not an
advanced polymeric nutrient complex,
but damp shredded wheat.
P r e s i d e n t i a l Talk-Back
Health Centre
H
ow can I continue without
exploiting my column to reply to
the letter by Irene Weinreb, the
Director of the Health Centre. Firstly I
would agree with her that the health
centre staff are 'dedicated and caring':
Whenever I have used the centre the
treatment I have received has always
been excellent. Though to say that I am
'confusing the issue of lack of appoint-
ments with lunchtime opening' simply
isn't true. The main complaint that I
receive about the Health Centre is that
it takes 'two weeks to book an appoint-
ment'. Irene has pointed out to me
that this Is not because of a lack of
appointments, but because IC students
have such little free time during the day
due to lectures, that
they can not fit the David Hellard,
available slots into _
their schedule, and I
this is where my I
point lies. Surely |j
changing the open-
ing hours to a time •
when students are I
available will fully | |
utilise the spaces
available and not ll
force them to miss I
lectures to get an JJ
a p p o i n t m e n t . I
Although I can I
understand that •
there is considerable administration to
be done, I still haven't heard a good
reason as to why this can not be done
outside of lunchtime hours, the period
of time at which the Student's Union is
at its busiest. In the health centre's
defence, however, they have extended
their opening hours to six o'clock,
something that can only be supported,
and the problems lie more directly with
the NHS in general than the staff of the
Health Centre, who have always struck
me as even worthy of our own medical
school (I mean that in a good way.)
Summer Ball
T
he summer ball is now going
ahead, it's great but quite a worry.
Although it will no doubt be a suc-
cess in the eyes of anyone who
attends, the finances are under a bit
more pressure. The
ICU President exuberance of this
, „ > year's ball makes
£55 seem like a co-
op closing down
,m, sale price and even
mi Michael Eavls has
-i been on the phone
l | p asking us to change
the date. Maybe I'm
™ ^ just getting paranoid

lids;

within a few weeks.
If you don't get one on time, maybe a
dodgy JMC student will tout you one for
£90.
