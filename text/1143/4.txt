Does Southside Shop cost more than Harrods?
by Ed Sexton
There is an o l d Imperial myth that South-
side Shop, w h i c h has recently started
describing itself as a "mini supermarket",
is more expensive than t h e most f a m o u s
and luxurious s h o p in t h e w o r l d . But is
there any Iruth in the claims?

prices of various

ceries a n d
snacks to those
f o u n d in t w o
major supermar-
kets, a n d Lords
on knightsbridgc, a c o m m o n night store
for residents o f Princes Gardens.
The difference b e t w e e n t h e newly
o p e n e d Waitrose o n Gloucester Road
a n d Sainsburys is m i n i m a l - W a i t r o s e
costs about 3 % more, o n average. South-
side Shop is about 3 0 % m o r e expensive
than Sainsburys, with Lords c o m i n g in at
Southside Shop - not
4 6 % . The p r o b l e m is that Southside Shop
is only o p e n 8 a m to 7 p m M o n d a y to fri-
day, 10am t o 3.30pm o n Saturday, a n d
isn't o p e n at all o n Sundays. Lords, o f
course, is o p e n all hours, a n d Sainsburys
isn't far b e h i n d , only closing o n Saturday

only o p e n M o n d a y to Saturday daytimes,
however, Southside is still very expensive
- a n d hardly w h a t o n e expects in a "mini
supermarket". Interestingly, there w a s
o n e item that w a s m o r e expensive at
Southside than in Harrods; butter. So
there is a sliver o f truth in that myth
after all...
