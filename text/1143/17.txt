Eaaaaaaaoooowwww dakka dakka dakka
dakka and another pesky Jerry pilot w a s
going to taste the salty English C h a n n e l .
The cool sophisticated pilot c h e c k e d his
six. called his w i n g m a n a n d turned for
h o m e . Well that is h o w it s h o u l d have
gone. In the real world the engine roared
into life. I taxied d o w n o n t o the runway
a n d then just b e f o r e leaving t h e g r o u n d
turned the plane into a nice b l a z i n g
m o d e r n art display of twisted metal. Per-
haps a fighter pilot's life is not for m e -
the planes just jitter and handle a bit too
quickly.
flight simulations especially m o d e r n
flight simulations are getting m o r e real-
istic. This usually m e a n s taking off, spot-
ting s o m e red dot o n the
radar, pointing your plane
roughly in the direction and
firing a f e w missiles. They
look brilliant, but arc m o r e
tedious than waiting for a
girlfriend to try s o m e
clothes o n in the c h a n g i n g
r o o m . Activision have lis-
t e n e d a n d g o n e a n d set a
flight sim back in the days
w h e n the bullets w e r e
d e s i g n e d to rip cloth, metal
a n d flesh f r o m less than
300 metres, finally t i m e to put s o m e
excitement back into the flight sims.
fighter Squadron is a bit of a mis-
n a m e d g a m e really. Sure there are fight-
out, these are obviously
lesshandv in l h . r o h a l i i
stakes, but at least you can ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
f l o w i n g spitfire o f the
g a n g - especially w h e n the m a c h i n e is
p o w e r e d by a nice fast graphics card.
The s o u n d is the stable a n d swift m o s -
quito, a d d i n g m o r e of an e d g e . Unfor-
ers aplenty all l u n a l e l y in

very g o o d actually, but in certain bits - the
quick flight g a m e for instance - it just
doesn't feel as fun as it s h o u l d be.

m e n t w h i c h is just slightly missing from
this flight sim. It is definately o n e for the
fly boys'-and girls' library, especially with
ihe net o p t i o n s out there, but perhaps
not for those trying to kick the shoot-em-
up b u g .

Civilization 2 (PSX)
Activsion • • • •
R e m e m b e r the old elephant jokes like
"what g a m e are two elephants able to
play in a mini's boot - squash"? Well this
is the reverse: w h a t old elephant can be
squashed Into a playstation - the g a m e
Civilization 2, that's what. Civ 2 is getting
a little bit old, especially with A l p h a Ccn-
turi and the n e w Civ - Call To Power twins
currently battling it out for the PC strat-
egy g a m e of the year award already, but
with n o t h i n g else a n y t h i n g like this o n
the playstation surely it has to be the
best.
Civilization 2 was almost a c o m p l e t e
copy of the original Civ - but with m u c h
better graphics a n d s o u n d . Controlling a
small tribe, you took t h e m from the d a w n
of history into the space a g e , via the
diplomatic, scientific and mil-
itary twists a n d turns that
occur o n the b u m p y railroad
of history. It was a case of
k n o w i n g w h e r e your culture
was g o i n g a n d getting there
b e f o r e a n y o n e else c o u l d .
Ever fancied a Utopia based
ISPS u p o n scientific democracy?
|: . yr;\ • i'i dsns
a nice benevolent dictator-
ship for those with conquest
in their eyes. The possibilities
w e r e almost endless. Well
finally PSX o w n e r s have finally got a
c h a n c e to control a e m p i r e a n d practice
g e n o c i d e o n a global scale f r o m the
comfort o f their o w n living rooms.
O b v i -
ously y o u
can't get a
w h o l e ele-
phant in a
mini's boot.
In fact w h a t
ever y o u
c o u l d fit in
the b o o t
wouldn't
l o o k m u c h
like an ele-
p h a n t but
m u c h m o r e a grey-red
puree, but luckily Civilization
2 o n the PSX has not b e e n
m a n g l e d b e y o n d r e c o g n i -
tion. The obvious c h a n g e is
in the view on the screen. As
the PSX resolution is lower
than the PC the a m o u n t of
information o n the screen
has b e e n cut d o w n . N o
m o u s e (well, not everyone
has a PSX m o u s e ) has also
meant the control m e t h o d
has b e e n redesigned. Its not
as simple as the PC way but is easy to
pick up - t h o u g h the m e n u system d o e s
m e a n that to g o to o n e o p t i o n can
require a bit of navigation r o u n d the
g a m e . T h e
lack of a key-
b o a r d also
m a k e s any
customisation
of city n a m e s
a c o m p l e t e
pain - though I
s u p p o s e that
prevents the
w h o l e of the
Celtic e m p i r e
h a v i n g cities
n a m e d after
villages a n d hamlets f r o m North War-
wickshire. The fancy little cut s e q u e n c e s
h a v e also b e e n cut out, t h o u g h the
throne r o o m a n d the advisors are kept.
But despite all of Ihis t r i m m i n g it is
still as incredibly addictive as it always
was. II passed the flatmate challenge
with flying colours - I c a m e downstairs
early in the m o r n i n g to discover my flat-
m a t e trying to hold off the Zulus and the
Romans, a n d this f r o m a person w h o at
midnight w a s saying that it l o o k e d too
slow a n d b o r i n g . G a m e Insomnia strikes
yet again. So PSX'ers beware: the strategy
g a m e is after y o u , a n d like a g o o d sleep
v a m p i r e will k e e p y o u a w a k e for as long
as it needs.
