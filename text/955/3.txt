Editorial
Fax trouble
On Wednesday evening, a fax was
received at Imperial College Union
containing an article from New
Statesman and Society, about
alleged extra marital affairs of a
certain John Major, a prime
minister. This fax was taken to IC
Radio and parts of it broadcast in
a piece about the article. As the
issue was clearly going to make
national news and a coup for IC
Radio before it appeared in the
national media, the transmission
was fully justified.
Yesterday, some delightful
individual rang Felix demanding to
speak to Declan Curry, the
journalist who covered this story.
Claiming to be from Carr Dunbarr
Associates, he left a return phone
number saying that they were
considering legal action against IC
Radio.
Needless to say this turned out to
be a false return number, of a non-
existent legal firm, about whom the
assistant to the editor of the New
Statesman and Society had never
heard. Can I now serve notice if I
find the worthless scum that gave
me a near heart attack, I will feed
him slowly through the collating
machine that puts Felix together
every week. This lowlife will be
hunted high and low until he is
tracked down and has his entrails
ripped from his snivelling body.
Winding me up on a Thursday
afternoon is a crime against
humanity and the perpetrator
deserves every bad luck, fate can
heap upon him.
Gagged?
If you have a spare moment pick
up a copy of London Student,
student newspaper of the year, and
read the story on page three about
Goldsmith Students' Union's
financial troubles. If you compare
the two stories, our coverage is very
similar to that of London Student.
Why is this? We are a College
magazine covering the story
because it is so large and it effects
the University of London. Yet
London Student a newspaper for the
whole of the University of London
thinks a small demonstration by
students about saving St
Bartholomew's Hospital is more
important. More significant that
Barts has been saved from closure,
so there is nothing to demonstrate
about.
Could this be an example of
executive pressure on the Editor of
London Student by 'Senior
Sabbaticals'? I hope this is not the
case and that Mike Herd is
upholding the freedom of the press
in the same rigorous manner all his
predecessors have.
Naughty
What is this our eagle eyes
around college see? Our beloved
estates electrician pushing the tools
of his trade around in a Sainsbury's
shopping trolley? Surely not the
same behaviour followed by Felix
and condemned by the Rector, a
few years ago?

Cat's Eyes
Madonna
Will the members of the press leave
Madonna alone. They always jump
at the chance to bury her no matter
what she does. If some other actress
had played the role that Madonna
has in Body Of Evidence, then it
would not have got such
disapproval from the putrid yankee
press. They would have sat quietly
until the end and then given the
thumbs down. But oh no, because
it stared Madonna, they stood up
and booed, hissed and jeered as
soon as the film started. They didn't
really go into the preview with a
closed mind, did they?
Exam Stress
There has been a lot of blurb and
waffle lately about coping with
exams, getting counselling etc etc.
With the relaxed atmosphere that is
university life, I find it sad to think
that some people still get stressed
over exams and course work. Why
worry? I am not saying that to have
no worry is normal, if anything it
is abnormal, but so is too much.
According to some counsellors/
therapists/know-all's, the start of
the road to hypertension and heart
attacks at 40 is not learning to relax
while attending any course which
involves an exam at the end. So
your chosen career depends on the
results of your exams, big deal.
SEX
It's that time of year again. One
month after the Christmas holiday
and all the films which are nothing
but excuses for explicit sex scenes
are released. You know the ones,
every 20 minutes at least there is yet
another romp, whether it be in the
bedroom, the hall, the lift, the
garden, the car etc. Why do the
distributors wait until this time of
year, when generally speaking, not
many people have any money left
to go and see these films? Why
don't they release them all year
round? What bastards!
Smoking
I am not that angry nor that fed up
with smokers who moan that their
right to light-up is being taken
away, but more frightened. I do not
want to end up fighting for my life
with lung cancer and have to watch
as my family stand over me
worrying if this day will be my last.
I am a non-smoker and do not
object to anyone who wishes to kill
themselves slowly over 40 to 60
years, so long they don't inflict the
potential suffering that they might
experience on me.
The Monarchy
'Relinquish the Monarchy!' they
cry. Anti-royalists unite more
strongly with the publication of the
Camillagate tapes, which they say
is the final nail in the coffin.
Divorces here, alleged affairs there,
lots of money being paid to them,
fires, scandals, the list grows week
by week. I can see why some want
to break-up one of the few things
that makes our country unique, but
they shouldn't. With European
unification, our monarchy is
possibly the only way to keep our
identity. It needs drastic and
immediate reforms though if we
want to be proud of our monarchy
again, and keep them off the front
pages.
