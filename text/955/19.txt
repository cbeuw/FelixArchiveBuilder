The Craziest Week of Imperial College
1\ Li VJ
R A G Week is the only chance
you get to go crazy with a good
excuse. Flan your lecturer,
grimreap your tutor, get your worst
enemies handcuffed together. A l l
this and more will be going on all
over college, organised by R A G
with help from various clubs,
societies and the CCU's. This
handy pullout contains just about all
the information you need to make
the most of this rare opportunity. If
you want to know more or sign up
for anything, come along to the
RAG Meeting this Friday lunchtime
at 1.10pm in the Union Lounge or
drop in to your friendly C C U office
to see what is going on. RAG Week
is completely indiscreet and
unavoidable so don't forget to Be
Mad! Be Silly! Be Part of it!
Rag Carnival
Bands, Disco, Barfly, Bar Extn,
Food... What more can anyone ask
for? There will be two bands in the
Concert Hall.The Jivin' Instructors
having completed a tour of Poland,
taking in Hamburg, Paris and Berlin
on the way, are now back in their
home city of London. They play an
energetic style of music which
twists its way across the decades
mixing the abrupt rhythms of Jump
Jive Jazz with R'n'B and Soul.
Humble Slug, again London based,
play a cool mix of well known Rock
numbers intermingled with a good
selection of their own original
pieces. A disco will be playing 'til
2am in the Union Lounge to
complement the Bar Extn, and Da
Vinci's will be open until late to
supply food. The barfly will be
available in the Union Dining Hall
where people can get happily stuck
upside down for most of the night,
which can help the happy
chunderer. The R A G Carnival is
the first event in R A G week and is
expected to sell out in advance.
Tickets are available from the ICU
office for £3.00 in advance, are we
ripping ourselves off, or £3.50 on
the night. All profits go to RAG.
Rag will be running a cloakroom
as usual, to safeguard your
belongings. Also, to be launched at
the carnival, the RAG Week T-shirt
will be on sale from the cloakroom
for the bargain price of £6.00.
These essential fashion items are
black, long-sleeved, heavyweight
shirts with multicoloured print on
the front, back and sleeve. They're
also very limited, so make sure you
bring some cash other than beer
money to the carnival.
