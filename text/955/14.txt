1 a series by Penguin of war
classics, this book recites the lives
of the Australian troops (luring the
Second World War. It gives the
impression that it was compiled
from far more comprehensive texts
by an Australian historian as the
bias definitely shows in the accounts
of battles fought and won or lost.
Although compelling it is a
difficult read that needs dedication
and attention to detail to be of any
interest; I had to stop several times
and restart in order to complete the
book. Despite being in essence a
war story compilation, this book
could just as easily be read by a
historian as by the casual reader.
Good editorial style improves what
could be otherwise disjointed affairs
within the life of the Australian
infantry and improves the continuity
of the text. Interesting but not easy
enough for bedside reading.

Critical Care by Richard
Pooling
Peter Werner Enst is a type of
doctor. He knows about medicines,
drugs and medical procedures, he
works long, hard hours and he only
sleeps every other night. The only
thing unusual about his job is that
he keeps dead people alive! It seems
that somewhere in the future, if you
have medical insurance, you are
kept alive as long as possible with
drugs, ventilators, heart/lung
transplants etc, no matter how
expensive or painful it is. Even if
you want to die you can't. Only
your family can decide that for you
and then they have to battle it out
in the courts against the doctors.
The problem for Werner is that
he falls in love with Bed 5's (a
terminally ill patient but then again
they all are) daughter. She wants
her father to be put out of his
misery; the hospital want to keep
him alive - Werner is stuck in the
middle.
The book is written with a
slighdy black sense of humour from
the point of view of those in the
medical profession who are always
dealing with death; people are
described as if they were different
types of meat in a butchers shop.
One problem I found was that a lot
of medical terms and phrases are

used but it was not necessary to
understand them as they did not
interfere with the story. I didn't like
the ending as it left you hanging in
the air but overall it was a humorous
and enjoyable read.

Fruiting Bodies and other
Fungi by Brian Lumley
It seems a shame that writers too
often opt for the empty
character/speedy plot format within
the short story framework.
Brian Lumley's Fruiting Bodies
offers little relief in that respect.
Thirteen stories without one
memorable character does seem a
bit mean. But, let 'undemanding' be
the key word here and you'll get the
picture.
As horror goes, this collection is
not particularly horrifying. Dry rot
going bump in the night just seems
too ridiculous to scare (as in the
leading story). A builder's quote for
the damage might have been more
effective.
More believable but ultimately
dull—both The Viaduct, and The
Pit Yackers see the good old village
idiot dusted off and wheeled out to
strut his stuff.
Along with haunted houses
(Recognition) haunted mirrors (The
Mirror of Netocris) parallel
dimensions (No Way Home) and so
on—the unbelievable continues to
become the actual, as predictably
the body count continues to grow.
All in all an inoffensive read. And
of course, entirely undemanding.
If you read Fruiting Bodies and
have nightmares—don't blame the
book—just revise your diet.

Raven by Thomas
Strittmatter
The sleeve notes looked promising.
I blindly hoped for a novel with the
social statement of If crossed with
the diced carrot induced humour of
the Wasp Factory. The publisher's
were even bold enough to state that
Thomas Strittmatter was the new
Gunther Grass (bugger me, he must
be good).
The novel basically follows
Raven through his 'ahem' painful
adolescence, the loss of his father
and his rude awakening upon
encountering the outside world after
leaving boarding school; and all
without ever really allowing us to
feel any great sympathy for him. In
fact, he gets beaten up, ripped off
and pissed upon so much towards
eviews

S H a w k i n g - ' A Life in
Science' by M White
and J Gribbin
This book was written by two
popular science authors in a very
readable style that makes this
biography a pleasure to read. The
combination of science
andbiography traces not only the
life of Prof. Hawking from his
earliest times,but also the
background to the scientific side of
his life, laying the theory behind
each of his revelations. Being
logically organised it does not
realybecome too apparent that the
authors are jumping from biography
from scientific theory and back
again. The explanation of the
scientific theorists both simple
enough to explain it to the least
intellgent reader, but also complete
enough for a reader with some
knowledge of physics.
The book begins with a
description of his school life before
the attack of the disabling disease
ALS (or Motor neuron disease as
it is more commonly known) and
explains the process through which
he slowly lost mobility and finally
took to his wheelchair and the birth
of his children. A really interesting
book, but whatever the quotes on
the back say, it is not acompanion
to " A Brief History of Time" and
there is very little overlap apartfrom
the fact both are about
physics.Good read.

the end of the book that you actually
despair of his ineptitude.
The book's strength lies in its
minor characters and black worldly
observations, however, time and
again those are strangled by the
complete absence of punctuation.
Was it written like this or has it just
disintegrated during translation?
(Originally German).
And whilst we're griping, how
come, although Raven loses touch
with all his school friends they turn
up again with the minimum of effort
as and when required.
Next time I'll read the original
German text, it may make for better
reading—before you ask, no I
don't.
