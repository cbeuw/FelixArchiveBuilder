Holbein Complaints
by Jacob Andelin
Residents of Holbein House have
complained this week about a lack
of facilities after last year's hall
refurbishment. Most student
complaints were due to the absence
of a common room, though some
added that the refurbished
accommodation provided was of an
'excellent' quality.
Speaking to Felix, a post-
graduate student, who didn't want
to be named, said, 'morale is very
low in the house at the moment, and
students are annoyed because of the
lack of communal facilities'. He
added that the students who were
living in the hall last year, of which
he was one, were not consulted on
which amenities they wanted. He
also said that current students had
not been informed that there would
be no common room before they
moved in. The 1992/3 edition of the
College produced Accommodation
handbook said that the hall would
have a T V room, daily papers and
a reading room.
In an interview with Felix,
Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, said that he was not
personally aware of any student
grievances. Mr Marshall added that
Basketball Trip
he didn't know whether or not
students were consulted or informed
about the changes. M r Marshall
continued by saying that if
approached, he would consult with
the Warden of Holbein House about
providing a television room, and
added that he didn't envisage any
problems with Holbein residents
using facilities in other halls.
Holbein Hall has now been
separated into its three constituent
houses, and two of these houses
were opened around Christmas.
Although all houses were due to
open in October 1992, work is still
continuing on the third house. M r
Marshall said the houses had been
separated to comply with new fire
regulations. This is disputed by
some living in Holbein Hall, who
claim that the houses were separated
to bring the number of students in
each house below the level for
which it is legally necessary to build
communal facilities. It was alleged
that this was designed to increase
income earned from the hall. The
remaining construction work is due
to finish on the 18th of March, and
total expenditure is expected to top
three quarters of a million pounds.
On Saturday, Imperial College's
Basketball teams will fly to Moscow
to compete in an international
tournament.
The competion will take place
between the 31st January and the
6th February, with teams from
Ausralia, France, Wales and Russia
taking part. One women's and one
men's team will be representing
Imperial at the games. Once in
Moscow, the Imperial side will play
games in the morning, leaving the
afternoon free for sightseeing tours.
Anette Fidrich, the tour
organiser, told Felix that the trip
was 'a bit unreal'. 'I didn't believe
it would happen', she added,
commenting on the speed with
which the trip was organised and
supported by range of sources at
short notice. It is believed that Sir
Eric Ash, Imperial's Rector, a
Japanese sponsor, Imperial College
Union, and Imperial's Marketing
Department helped the plan
succeed.

IC Attack
by Gareth Light, News Editor
Two female Imperial College
students have been attacked
and assaulted by five men. The
attack, outside the Mathematics and
Computing Department in Queen's
Gate, took place on Friday 11
December 1992, one week before
the end of last term.
According to one of the victims,
the five men were moving north
along Queen's Gate when they
surrounded the women. When one
of the women was grabbed from
behind, she started to scream and
lash out at her assailant. At this
point, another of the men became
extremly violent. He 'Karate
kicked' and punched both the
women, inflicting only superficial
injuries.
The men eventualy ran away
towards Hyde Park. After giving
chase, the women managed to
apprehend one man, forcibly
dragging him to the Imperial
College Union building. The man
was taken into the custody of
College security, who then called
the Police.
The Police later took statements
from both of the women, and took
the man away for questioning. In
custody, he told the Police that he
was a former member of Imperial
College, and that he was on his way
to an Indian Society function in the
Junior Common Room (JCR), in
the Sherfield Building. Further
investigation lead the Police to
believe that the man gave a false
name. Police added that the victims
would have to identify the other
attackers in identity parades,
something which neither of the
women were prepared to do.
This incident is the latest in a
series of personal attacks against
women on College grounds.
Imperial College Union has
reminded students that rape alarms
are still available at no charge from
the Union Office.
