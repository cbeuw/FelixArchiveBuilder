Rag Pull-Out
29 January 1993 Felix 955
MINERS AND IC VIRGINS
The match of the weekend has to be
the Charity Rugby match between
the Royal School of Mines Rugby
Football team and Imperial
College's own, newly resurrected,
Ladies Rugby Football team, the IC
Virgins (yes, we believe you!). The
ladies through down the gauntlet
last term and the men were so
bemused that they have agreed to
play in suspenders and Wellington
boots to give the girlies a chance.
But will they need a chance?
You have the chance to find out
by coming along and supporting the
greatest challenge since men
reached the moon. Kick off is at
2.00pm on Sunday 31st January,
and coaches will be leaving from
Beit Quad at Midday. For the
bargain price of £3.00 you will be
ferried in the lap of luxury to the
Osterly pitches to watch this
extravaganza, with a bar open all
day to keep you refreshed. Coaches
return at 6.00pm to give you time
to recover for the pub crawl in the
evening. Tickets are available in
advance only, from the RSMU
Office, the I C U Office and
members of the ladies Rugby team.
Limited tickets will be available on
the day on a first come first served
basis.
If you can't make the match but
fancy walking off with a prize
anyway, we are running a
sweepstake on the score, so pop
along to the R A G Stall in the JCR
at lunchtime today to stake your
claim on a result. Scores can also
be bought on the day but the stakes
close at kick off. This promises to
be one wacky event so miss it at
your peril, after all, what else is
there to do on a Sunday afternoon?
TOP PRESS:STOP PRESS:STOP
News has just come in that there's
more to R A G Week than crazily
excellent events. Services will be
operating all week round and, for
a small fee, you can get just about
anything done to just about anyone.
City and Guilds Union are running
their notorious Hitsquad and the
Royal College of Science are doing
Grim Reaping, Pint-o-grams,
handcuff-o-grams and Milky-
Milky-o-grams (for Mary
Whitehouse Experience fans).
To explain these further (for
anyone who has been hibernating
for the first half of the year)
Hitsqaud provides you with the
oportunity to get a flan placed in the
face of your best friend or worst
enemy. Lecturers are not out of the
question if you can club together to
cover the danger money, and, if you
think the final year students are too
boring, why not get a mass hit taken
out on an entire lecture? Hits can
be booked on production of a union
card and some cash at the C & G U
Office in Mech Eng. Contact lens
wearers should get themselves a
free badge also from the C & G U
office to prevent flans hitting them
in the face and, if you feel you are
likely to get hit more than you'd
like, immunity can be bought from
the same place.
Grim Reaping involves setting a
grim reaper to follow someone
around all day until they cough up
enough money to get rid of them.
For a small charge you can have a
pint and a packet of bar nibbles
delivered to someone (even
yourself) during a lecture, lab,
tutorial...you tell us where, when
and who and we'll sort it out.
Handcuff-o-grams involve
handcuffing two victims together
until they cough up sufficient
amounts of money to get the keys.
Who do you hate enough to
handcuff them to that smelly,
boring, person in the corner? For
any of these services pop along to
the RCS Office, round the back of
Chemistry and see one of the
friendly bods inside.
Also running throughout R A G
Week will be Killer. This has been
covered in previous issues of Felix
but, just to re-cap, the aim is to be
the only contestant left alive at the
end of RAG Week. There are Cash
Prizesfor the winners and the
playing is a load of fun too. To
enlist, turn up at the RCS Office
with two passport photos and £2.50.
You will be presented with a set of
rules and your first target. The two
most important rules are, Get them
before they get you, Try not to kill
them completely and Don't try it out
on the Diplomatic police as their
guns will be a little bit more fatal
than your water pistol!
Just remember that if none of the
above appeal to you (strange
person!), they will appeal to others
so Watch Your Back!
