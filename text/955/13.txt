Julian Cope—T&C 25th Jan
We knew Copey wasn't calling off-
side this time. You could almost
smell the incense in the Bull & Gate
next door. This was the 'Julian
Cope Love in' that drew me up to
Kentish Town last Guy Fawkes
instead of following the masses to
Battersea Park and finding out it had
been cancelled.
To make up, he obviously felt
obliged to give us good value by
being both support and headline
with two sets, the latter having a
solo acoustic half. The first was a
warm-up consisting of Jehovah kill
and Peggy Suicide dressed in
leopard skin leggings and baggy
shirt emphasising his scrawny
frame. His invitation to 'treat us just
like the support' was taken all too
literally. From the opening
'Upwards 45°' through the funky
'East Easy Rider' and until the last
two songs the crowd swayed ever
so gently if at all.
Only for the immensely toe
tapping 'Hanging out and Hung up
on the Line' did the audience have
a token mosh. Don't get me wrong
the sound was fine. The playing was
tight and his cheerful and slightly
camp repartee was quite enough to
entrance his fans but there was
something missing.
We went upstairs for the second
set and I found myself standing next
to Nigel Kennedy, having a smoke.
I was just about to ask him why he
didn't shove his Strad down that
pompus prodigal twat's throat on
Wogan the other week, when he
and his girlfriend up and left.
Another scoop bites the dust!
Anyway back to the concert. As
I said the second set commenced
with a few songs with just him and
his guitar. Again the crowd went
wild, with appreciation for
'Pristeen' and 'Robert Mitchum'.
What everybody was waiting for
was the rock 'n' roll set. The
reaction was immediate when phase
three started with 'World Shut Your
Mouth'. Thank God. From then on
he hit the 30 song mark with new
and old material including 'Double
Vegetation', 'Poet is Priest' and
half of 'Floored Genius'.
He's weird 'Maybe I'm a lesbian
in a man's body—yeah I like that'
but he's also brilliant and at the
height of his powers and we knew
it. The set ended with Lynx's
anthem 'Reward the Fox' and the
encore was short but sweet with
Tear Drop Explodes debut
'Reward'. Almost three hours on
stage and he still is the bouncing
baby of the early 80s. Pity the
crowd took so long to get into it.

Man I love it. It's beautiful, just
totally rocking, man. No. Not the
music. The clear plastic C D case.
Art & Functionality, and it's just so,
so, so beautiful. As for the music,
it sounds like The Cult used to.
What's going on?

The Julie Dolphin —Roses Extreme—Tragic Comic
No-one talks much about the wine
lakes or the butter mountains
anymore. So, perhaps they are no
longer with us. Still, in the world
of 'popular' music, the scrapheap
of indie bands remains steadily
accumulative. The influx of bands
like The Julie Dolphin suggests that
it will remain so. Which is not to
say that they are a terrible band,
rather that there is no direction or
spark in their music. They are
probably nice people who look after
homeless dingos, but when it comes
to stringed instruments that's not
enough.
Sounding somewhere between a
Extreme; known for their dewy
ballad which all A O R bands are
obliged to release, and also as fine
examples of another rock
phenomena: the growing
boringness of professionalism.
This single captures their
problem in a shell. Take one semi-
interesting idea for a song, say that
timeless clown Charlie Chaplin,
then reduce that 'Tragic Comic' to
a symbol in a trite Top 30 lurve
song.
'Just call me a tragic comic, cause
I'm in, in love with you.'
The song itself sways along in a
friendly acoustic manner trying to
make something of itself, before
being cruelly stamped on by the
chorus. It is a lost opportunity to
regain the rawness of earlier work,
I fear it could be big in America.

The Cult—Pure Cult
Yes, yes, ok, so I've been caught
dancing to 'She Sells Sanctuary',
and I really went to a Cult show,
once. (November '89, if I recall
correctly), but, somewhere around
1990, The Cult lost the highway to
Rock City, and followed a wagon
train to Blacker (??—TS)
Reservation, home of the Indian
tribe of such pap as the last album.
And then to top it all, and doesn't
this look a bit strange given their
current hit, at Finsbury Park last
June, they announced the 'new era'
of Cult, and that they'd never play
'Sanctuary' again. Oh Ian, Oh
Billy, where did you go? Ever since
'87, you've been sliding down
pop's dumper, picking up baggage
like moss, and as a chronicle of the
demise of the goth-rock culture, this
greatest hits album is unparalleled.

The Tragically Hip—Fully
Completely
Apparently the Hip are very big in
their native Canada. Which is not
to belittle them. They follow in deep
footsteps as Canadian artists have
been no slouches in the music
arena: KD Lang, Robbie
Robertson, Cowboy Junkies, The
McGarrigles, Mary Margaret
O'Hara have all hailed North of the
American border.
The smoke of 'Laissez Faire'
hangs heavy over much of the
album as if you, the listener, were
actually there, facing the great
plains which stretch for miles
around, swathed in a kind of eerie
bleakness. Best illustrated by the
epic 'At the Hundredth Median', it
embraces an intensity seldom
reached without recourse to the
feedback wall of Jesus and Mary
Chain. The world's bread bin packs
a quality all of its own. The other
reinforcing quality of the band is a
certain melodic poise which is
sweetly short and tight—as in
'Pigeon Camera' and 'We'll Go
Too'. Alas, some of the shots are
wide of the mark, as the Hip get
bogged down in too many puddles
of AOR infection.
There are plenty of bands in the
same scene as The Tragically Hip,
who's to say whether they are the
best? But you could certainly do
worse than lending them your ears.
