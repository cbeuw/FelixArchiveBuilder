Two
In Two life is portrayed within the
four walls of a pub. Two actors,
Tricia Thorns and Martyn Whitby
play the multitude of characters.
The opening acts are hilarious—
we are introduced to the bickering
landlord and landlady. Throughout
we see friendly interaction between
landlord/lady and punter, and the
relationship between the proprietors
who share a seven year tragedy.
The perfect beer-bellied—Saturday-
Night-Fever-medallion man (minus
medallion) with his 'bit on the side';
a lonely old woman whose only
pleasure is her evening drink;
possessive and henpecked husbands
and frustrated and emotional
battered wives are among the
characters. Superbly played with
dazzling versatility by the two
actors, the inner hopes, fears and
dreams of the characters are
brilliantly captured.
The play provides good laughs
without being superficial. I highly
recommend it—in fact don't miss it.

Eyes Right
In 1971, a prison riot occurred in
Attica, America. The state police
were instructed to seize control of
the prison and not to harm any of
the hostages. But since the state
police were mosdy composed of
psychotic soldiers back from the
Vietnam war, there was little
chance of a low death count.
This play is set in the house of
one such demented ex-soldier who
is called upon, along with his
neurotic Vietnam buddy, to sort out
the riot. You are taken on a journey
as the situation develops and are
given a good insight as to the mental
state of two these people, and how
the people around them are affected
by their memories of the Vietnam
war.
All the cast are remarkably
convincing, especially Richard
Brake as Mr. Seriously-Unbalanced
and Sara Montague as the tarty,
nymphomaniacal, slutty, slow
witted wife of the soldier in whose
house the play is set. The American
accents are accurate, but thankfully
weak enough not to make you wince
every time one of the cast has to
speak.

King Baby
Not light entertainment, though
sometimes entertaining, James
Robson's play takes an intimate
peek into the working of an alcohol
rehabilitation centre. James King
(Tom Georgeson), a self-made
businessman, checks into the centre
in what he claims is an attempt to
save his marriage. Under the
chameleon style leadership of
Jimmy (Lalor Roddy)—reformed
alcoholic—the slow process towards
healing is begun.
The play tries to examine the
debasing aspect of alcoholism in a
somewhat detached manner. Yet,
certainly when Maxine (Sheila
Reid), one of the other residents,
tells her story the audience is aware
of the horror of the depth to which
she has lowered herself in the
pursuit of alcohol.
The humour is bittersweet being
more the result of nerves than true
laughter. The tension of the play is
built into a potential confrontation
between Jimmy and King Baby, as
our businessman has been
christened. For the duration of the
play we wait for King Baby's story.
When it comes it is at first
disappointing as Robson seems to
have sacrificed plausibility to
Freud's Oedipus Complex.
However, Georgeson's
performance makes this confession
as poignant as the others drawing
upon the universal experiences that
are present. It is this that ensures
audience attention and interest
together with the horrifying idea 'it
could be me'.

London International Mime
Festival—18th Jan-3rd Feb
Els Joglars
The London International Mime
Festival is a showcase for
innovative physical and visual
theatre—although a festival of
mime, many productions include
speech.
Set in a psychiatric hospital,
psycho-drama therapy is used to
treat patients. Flamenco dance, live
music and visual action give an
energy and depth you'll never find
in mainstream West End theatre.
This extraordinary spectacle really
goes beyond the 'normal' bounds of
theatre. It is deeply bizarre, original
and daring. A plot synopsis in
English is provided but unless you
understand Spanish you'll miss the
brilliant one-liners—but maybe (?)
still worth seeing for something
you'll never see anywhere else.

Theatre Smith-Gilmour
Michelle Smith and Dean Gilmour
have a unique style of mime using
powerful images with text. They are
extremely funny and manage to
combine an everyday situation with
unexpected surrealism. Their clever
interaction with the audience finds
you completely engrossed—worth
seeing.

Concert
Yo Yo Ma and Kathryn Stott
A house packed to the rafters to
hear one of the master cellists of our
time, Yo Yo Ma, had a surprise
treat. Far from just a banal
backdrop, Kathryn Stott triumphed
over that lousy Steinway to become
the star of the evening.
Beethoven's Sonata No 4 in C Op
102 glittered with detail and wit
focused by Miss Stott's con-
sciencious accompanyment. There
followed the highlight of the
evening Shostakovich's Op 40 in D
minor. The energy and excitement
generated by Ma's crackling
accuracy and Stott's verve and
confidence was extraordinary. At
their best in the allegro movements,
this pair defined all that live music
is about.
Some Heifitz-Gershwin arrange-
ments were not my cup of tea but
were excellently delivered. The
Dvorvak Op 75 allowed the duet to
explore a lyric quality which, to my
taste Ma does not really do justice.
His playing is dramatic, relaxed and
incisive but the thin quality of the
higher notes and his essentially
gritty tone becomes inadequate in
such romantic works. The closing
selection of De Falla Spanish songs
was a joy. Dancing and swooping,
stomping and tripping piano and
cello vied and entwined in the heady
climax of a stunning concert.
