Secure books
by Jacob Andelin
Imperial College Union
Bookstore has installed a new
security system. From next
Wednesday, expensive items will be
magnetically tagged, with alarms
being activated if goods are taken
out of the shop without prior
payment. Should anyone leave the
shop without being caught, alarms
will be set off again if the item is
taken into either the bookstore or
the library.
The installation comes after
repeated thefts of textbooks and
expensive stationary. Before the
installation of the new security
system, closed circuit security
cameras were the only means of
detecting shoplifters.
Students seeking support for
expeditions this summer should
contact Don Adlington on internal
extension 3041 or Dr Bob Schroter
on internal extension 4083 to claim
help from the Imperial College
Exploration Board. Claims should
be made before 10th February, as
this is the date of the Board's final
meeting.

Investigations Unit
A union finance officer who
embezzled almost £1,000 of union
funds is not to face criminal
charges, it was revealed this week.
Paul Holmes, Vice President of
Finance at London's Goldsmith
College Students' Union, was last
term suspended from his post whilst
'irregularities in Union procedure
were being investigated'.
A leaked letter to Terry Murtagh,
Goldsmith Union President, from
West and Company, a
Berkhamstead firm of Chartered
Accountants, details what it says are
five cases where M r Holmes abused
both the Goldsmith Union credit
card and Union petty cash.
• £50 was paid to a Ms Verda
Mitchell on 8th October 1992, as a
refund for a deposit on a union
minibus. No deposit made in the
name of Verda Mitchell can be
traced in Union financial records.
Mr Holmes has responsibility for
receiving deposits.
• £50 was paid to M r Holmes by
Mr Ben Wilson on behalf of a
Union society on 16 October 1992.
No record exists of this money
being paid into Union accounts. M r
Holmes was refunded in full on 30
October, with £25 coming from
Union petty cash. M r Holmes has
responsibility for petty cash.
• Six payments each of £30 were
mad on various dates to Mr Holmes
by M r Tom Fisher of RAT Books.
Mr Holmes was responsible for
receiving these payments. Of the
£180 paid by M r Fisher, only £90
was paid into Union funds. The
remaining £90 is unaccounted for.
• M r Holmes used the Goldsmith
Students' Union credit card to pay
P&O European Ferries the sum of
£322.50. M r Holmes has informed
the accountants that the money was
used for a private trip to
Amsterdam.
• The Goldsmith Students' Union
credit card has also been used to
purchase food from the Raffles
Wine Bar on three dates in
September, for the sums of £28.20,
£23.10 and £28.40. No receipts for
these purchases have been given to
the Union.
Since the investigation by West
and Company Chartered
Accountants, Goldsmith Union
officers have uncovered further
outstanding debts and financial
irregularities on the part of M r
Holmes. Terry Murtagh, Goldsmith
Union President, confirmed that the
total sum concerned is £983.25.
M r Murtagh told the
Investigations Unit this week that
the embezzlement was discussed at
a Union General Meeting last
Thursday,a meeting which was
advised by lawyers from the
National Union of Students. M r
Murtagh said that, after considering
Mr Holmes' 'assets', the meeting
decided to 'let the matter drop', in
preference to a police enquiry or a
civil court action. 'We will now get
on with running our Union,' he
said.
Felix News Reporters
On Thursday 26th January, a five
minute section of a pornographic
programme was broadcast by the
Student Television Of Imperial
College (STOIC). The programme
was seen on the television screens
in Da Vinci's Bar in the Union
Building.
A press statement released to
Felix the next day by Matthew
Balchin, STOIC Chairman, said the
incident was caused by 'the
accidental routing of an off-air
satellite receiver to Da Vinci's Bar
by a private individual'.
An eye-witness told Felix that the
broadcast depicted 'a girl in a tight
bikini who removed her top and
rubbed her breasts for about two
minutes before slipping into a
Jacuzzi'.
The eye-witness said that the
broadcast had lasted approximately
5 minutes, and that there had been
some channel switching for most of
the evening.
On Wednesday night, M r Hugh
Eland, Publications Board
Chairman, called the screening
'deplorable'. M r Eland added that
he would expect a committee level
resignation from STOIC over the
transmission. 'I'm absolutely
astounded that they managed to do
this again,' he told IC Radio.
STOIC representatives were
unavailable for further comment.
The 'private individual' has not yet
been named.
