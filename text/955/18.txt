X-Country Run Rugby Firsts
Trent Park is a very muddy place
indeed—as the IC X-country team
found out last Wednesday. Only the
most brave (and stupid) of our
runners bothered with the warm-up
lap—it was much more comfortable
to stand at the edge of the field
thinking 'don't like the look of that!'
However, the time for London's
cheapest beauty treatment came for
us all—a case of grit your teeth, try
not to fall over since it's a very
uncool thing to do, and dream of
post-race baths.
Mud aside (and everywhere
else!), the team ran extremely well.
The women managed an unbeatable
1-2-3 combination. Jenny, Maria
and Julia simply destroyed the
opposition! The eight IC men also
performed very well—notably
Simon Thomas (8th), Dave Knight
(17th) and the very speedy
orienteer—Jake Badger (20th). In
fact, they ran so splendidly that the
captain almost bought them fish and
chips. .There was a last minute
technical hitch due to the fact that
he is bloody skint! Ah well, forward
to the next race in two weeks time
at Richmond.
Hyde Park Relays—to be held on
Saturday 13th February. It will be
a massive event (between 600 and
1000 entrants).

Does too much stress impair your exam
performance? If so, Claudio Calvi's
examination stress workshops may help
you.
Claudio will run the workshops on three
consecutive Wednesdays-10th, 17th and
24th February-at the Health Centre, 14
Prince's Gardens from 1.00-2.30pm on
each of the three days.
If you would like to attend you would be
very welcome-just ring the Health Centre
(3099) and leave your name with one of
the receptionists.
Imperial bowed out of the U A U on
Wednesday when West London
Institute of Not Very High
Education beat IC 34-0.
Now, to you, that might seem a
bit of a dubbing, but to keep the
score that low required enormous
effort on the part of IC.
West London, obviously wary of
playing last year's semi-finalists,
had bought their bigs guns into the
team, namely Darren O'Leary and
Chris Tarbuck of 1st division
saracens.
Tarbuck stamped his authority on
the game by scoring two tries, the
first one after all of about 30
seconds, and the second to make in
17-0 after their scrum-half had
scored.
They scored another 17 points in
the second half after O'Leary's
converted try was followed by a
penality and a converted try by their
fly half.
The score would have been a lot
more if it wasn't for IC's tigerish
tackling and a series of knock ons
by West London.
On IC's side Chris Telling and
Mark Wishart were outstanding in
defence, and Andrew Montgomery
put in some telling, if illegal,
tackles. But the whole team
deserves credit for their best
performance of the season.
Indoor Football
Here it is again folks! The IC
Indoor Soccer Tournament (IC
1ST) is about to kick off and I hope
teams are raring to fight for the
magnificent IC 1ST trophy won last
year by the overwhelming skill and
competence of the IC 1st team. This
year, to enable all societies to have
an even chance of winning the
prize, it was necessary to limit the
number of Imperial College
Football Club players per team to
two. This, of course, means that
there will be no IC football teams
in the tournament. After all this is
more of a fun tournament and not
our chance to get stuffed!!
In order to have better control of
procedures and fixtures it was felt
that the number of teams entering
the tournament shall be limited to
sixteen. A l l societies/clubs who
wish to enter must either be under
the banner of the Overseas Students
Committee (OSC) or affiliated
directly to Imperial College Union.
There will be an entrance fee of £5
per team, the same as last year.
These monies plus funds donated by
the OSC will be awarded back to
the semi-finalists and finalists in the
form of trophies and prizes. Each
society/club can enter only one
team unless the response to the
tournament is poor
(UNLIKELY!!). The tournament is
being organised this year by myself,
Kuldip Sandhu (OSC Sports
Officer), and I am now ready to
accept entries to the tournament. If
you want an entry form then come
to my office. I can be found in room
G23, Department of Materials (ext
6017). A l l entries must be in by
Tuesday 2nd February. Remember
there's only 16 teams this year so
get cracking.
There will be four groups of four.
Each team will play every other
team in its group once. The top two
teams from the four groups go
through to the quarter-finals.
