A Kurt Weill Cabaret
I read in my music dictionary (yes,
some of us do attempt some
research for these beautifully
crafted novellas known as
review-biz):
'Kurt Weill (1900-50). German-
born composer. Using some jazz-
based idioms, he had early success
with the 'Threepenny Opera', and
with 'Rise and Fall of the City of
Mahogonny'—both texts by Brecht
with satirical criticism of capitalist
society. Penalised by the Nazis as
a Jew and a composer of 'decadent'
music he settled in the USA, 1935.
His American works include music
to various Broadway musical plays.
Other works include a cantata and
two symphonies.'
Wow, and I just thought he wrote
'Mack the Knife' and 'May to
December'.
The little cast of four (plus
excellent pianist Paul Chilvers) in
this little super-pub Theatre
provided a performance that, if
nothing else, gave an explosive
delivery of the music, spanning less
well known classical ballads
through to his Broadway hits.
Unfortunately neither of the two
female performers seemed very
well suited to Weill's eclectic
idiom. Denise Silvery would have
been more at home on an opera
stage although, wide-eyed and arms
akimbo, she gave each song all she
had, Jane Wheldon seemed to be
happier singing in her lowest
possible register or, preferably, not
singing at all, using an admirable
'sprachgesang' style. The male cast
were more at ease with the whole
affair, using their light, though
rather bland, baritone voices to
good effect.
The first eleven songs were in
German so to someone like me,
with complete ineptitude for
languages (including English, alas)
the sole method of any
comprehension (other than peering
in the gloom at my programme
notes) was through the cast's tight
delivery, although sometimes over
choreographed to the point of
vulgarity.
Apparently this show played to
packed houses in Amsterdam.
Maybe the Dutch audiences, like
me, didn't care about not
understanding a word that was sung
and were happy to let the wonderful
music wash over them as they
enjoyed a meal and a couple of
pints.
