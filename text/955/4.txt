Society shame
Dear Felix,
I note with concern the lack of
enthusiasm in the Club and
Societies column of Felix. With
over 100 clubs and societies within
Imperial College Union, it is indeed
strange that this section is not
crammed with articles every week.
In fact, the converse is true. This
was blatandy obvious in the last two
editions of Felix. In the first issue
this term, the column was scrapped
and in the second one (i.e. last
week), the articles were cleverly
spread out and there was still space
for notices on the Health Centre and
New Year Carnival.
The blame here does not lie with
Felix, but with the Clubs and
Societies concerned. I hope that in
future there would be more
submissions, so that this column
does not die out. A point I should
like to make is that this column is
one way to promote a certain club
or society to the rest of the Imperial
Community. By writing in about
activities of your club or society
others will be informed and perhaps
even interested to participate out of
curiosity or interest.
I would like to address this in
particular to all overseas socieites.
Use Felix to convert your culture
and way of life to the others. As
most members of an overseas
society are of that country of origin,
the purpose of spreading knowledge
of culture, tradition and way of life
to others (as most overseas societies
have proclaimed in the Union
handbook!) is somewhat reduced in
capacity. At least by regularly
informing others through Felix this
particular purpose of you society is
served. Do not waste this
opportunity please.

Why don't you
Dear Jonty,
When I first arrived at Imperial
College, I was a little over-awed by
the place, the people, the bits 'n'
bobs. I thought, 'Wow, this place
is great'. I still do, 1.2 terms later.
On arrival I also thought, 'Wow,
what a great magazine; it must have
a truly amazing editor.' and 'Wow,
what a great college; it must have
a truly amazing president.' I still
do.
However, I also think that the
Trouble
Dear Jonty,
I was wondering if there was a way
of dismissing permanent members
of staff, in the same way that we as
ICU students can get rid of
sabbaticals, via votes of no
confidence?
I ask this question because I was
unfortunate in having to ask a
question to the ICU receptionists
pertaining to Union activities. This
simple question was met with a
barrage of unhelpfulness.
grow up little
editor of Felix and the president of
IC Union have better things to do
with their time than have a go at
each other in the hallowed pages of
Felix just because they apparently
have a slight personality mismatch.
Come on lads, you're both big boys
now. Show us how excellent you
really are; go and get on with
something worthwhile instead of
squabbling.
On a totally different matter,
you're always advertising for new
Perhaps the Union's officer in
charge of appointing staff might
consider that if and when voluntary
membership comes along, they
won't get many subscriptions if the
receptionists signing people up are
rude, patronising and seemingly
suffering from continual menstrual
tension.
Yours sincerely,

reviewers. Well, I've been into the
Felix Office twice to volunteer
(very unwise I realise), carefully
leaving my name and a contact
address, and I haven't heard
anything from anyone yet. If that's
what happens to all your volunteers,
no wonder there isn't anyone new
to write reviews.
Keep up the good work.

in case you need a new reviewer).
