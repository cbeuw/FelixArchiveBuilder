Bookstore bonuses
Sales of Books and Stationery are
up! Thank you to everyone who
chose to shop in the Union
Bookstore last term. We are
delighted by the increase in students
who regularly buy their textbooks
from us, especially as some people
wrongly believe their books may be
cheaper elsewhere. This comes
from all the publicity given to
Dillons about undercutting
publishers' prices. However, they
only do this on top sellers such as
fiction, as it is not worth their while
selling specialised texts at a discount
price. So, as the Net Book
Agreement stands, every bookseller
is bound by law to sell books at the
publishers' specified price; a
difference in price only occurs
between shops if a new edition or
reprint comes out, then the latest
copy tends to be more expensive.
So, whilst you can rest assured
that you don't have to pay more for
the books that are available on your
doorstep, you will also find that we
try to offer all stationery goods at
prices that beat High Street
retailers. The policy at I C U
Bookstore has always been to keep
profits to a minimum in order to
achieve low prices on essential
student buys such as paper, pens
and files—we even managed to
reduce the price of paper and lever
arch files this year. However, if we
have slipped up and youfindan
item of the same quality at a lower
price elsewhere, please let us know
and we'll be happy to investigate.
Since we try to offer the best
deals for students, it is
disappointing that, as well as an
increase in sales this year, we have
suffered a large increase in the
amount of shoplifting. Textbooks in
particular are disappearing and
unfortunately, if we lose money to
thieves during the year, we are not
able to offer the lowest prices next
year, so it's really fellow students
who lose out. With this in mind, we
are installing a security system
going live on February 1st, which
should either deter thieves or catch
them as they leave the shop. It's a
pity that we've had to introduce
this, and we hope there won't be
any teething problems, but for your
own peace of mind please ensure
you get, and keep, your receipt
for major purchases. Hopefully,
the dishonesty of a minority of
I've nearly caught up on the sleep
I missed over last Friday's New
Year Carnival. If you went, I hope
you had as good a time as it looked
like you were having. If you didn't
go, then you missed out on a great
night's entertainment.
There are too many people to
thank them all individually but there
are just a few I need to mention by
name. Thanks to BJ, Lisa, Simon
and Greg and to all the Ents kids
(you know who you are), to
Dramsoc who gave so much time
up to provide a great lightshow, to
those in the Union Office Dom,
Cathy, Michelle, and Zona and
Louise (my financial gurus) and to
students won't continue to cost all
the honest ones that give us their
custom.
Jonty for always being there
(Rupert Murdoch or someone
would be proud of you or
something!!!). Thank you to anyone
else who I've forgotten.
So what have we got planned for
you in the next few months. Well
we've hopefully got a World Music
Night and also a reggae band lined
up, as well as the usual Ents discos
with some special guest DJ's to be
announced. Plus more besides...
For the next two weeks, I C U
Ents are on holiday, we'll be hitting
the sun, WISH Y O U W E R E
HERE!
To be continued...
Andy.
