The Message
Perhaps not one of his better known
roles, but by playing Hamzah,
Anthony Quinn takes on a larger
than life pesonality. This provides
the setting for the film 'The
Message'. With the only too
frequent good vs. evil scenario, this
film has the added dimension f
being based on a historical and
important event.
'The Message' is a film on the
early stages of Islam focussed
around the Prophet Muhammed and
his companions. It gives a vivid
dissection of the life before and
after die advent of the prophethood,
and the change of society from a
barbaric and selfish existence to one
of purpose and dignity.
However despite all intentions
and efforts the film quite
understandably fails to compact a
life's work and struggle into a
couple of hours. But it still manages
to give an immensity of the effort
achieved by one man over the
period of a generation.
But let me not have the last word
and leave with a passage from
Thomas Carlyle's 'Heroes and
Hero Worship' ' The word of such
a man (Muhammed) is a voice from
natures own heart; men do and must
listen to that, as to nothing else; all
else is wind in comparison ... '.
'The Message' will be shown on
Wednesday 3rd February at 3:00
pm in Mech Eng 220. Entrance is
FREE and refreshments will be
served.
Dribblers
The Dribblers were in fine form as
they embarked on their first league
game of the term. Everybody in the
team played brilliandy. A shot from
just outside the penalty area by Jo
left the opposition standing in
stunned silence. Caroline had some
storming runs up the centre only to
be out manoeuvered by the
opposition's goalie.
We were one-nil down at half
time after a wind assisted shot from
the wing swerved around Linda
who's proving to be one of the best
goalies the Dribblers have ever had.
We were playing well and a win
still seemed possible but alas it
wasn't to be. It was a tough match
and although the scoreline looks
decisive it doesn't reflect the quality
of play by the Dribblers. The ball
spent most of its time in the
opposition's half but then
everybody says that, but honestly it
did. If only our finishing on the
pitch was as good as our finishing
in the bar!
I shook hands with the Ref, at
least he hadn't just had a wee at the
edge of the pitch like last week!
We played very well. Well done
to everybody it was one of the most
enjoyable matches of the season.
Trials for the U L U squad are on
Saturday 30th January at Motspur
Park.
