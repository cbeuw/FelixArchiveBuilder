Tue Feb 2nd
The first chance of the week to get
your clothes off for charity. Or if
you prefer, keep your clothes and
just have a laugh. It's up to you how
much you pay to get into this
groovy disco. The principle is this:
the less you wear, the less you pay.
Simple, huh? And yes, people do
frequently get in for free. How
much of you will we be seeing
there?
Slave Auction'
Piles of washing up, laundry getting
on top of you, lecture notes in need
of copying. Meet the solution. The
Slave Auction is where anyone who
is silly enough to take part auctions
off twenty four hours of their time,
with the proceeds going to charity.
Buying a slave for a day could help
you get your life sorted out. A l l
your meals cooked, clothes washed,
lab reports written
up.. .unfortunately, sexual favours
by consent only! But still worth
considering - you could even club
together with a group of friends to
buy a really good-looking slave!
Mech Eng 220 at lunchtime. If you
fancy signing up as a slave pop
along to the Guilds Union office and
plonk your name down.

Hypnosis^
Martin Taylor, hypnotist
extraordinaire, hits the college for
his annual R A G Week appearance.
I don't need to tell anyone who has
been before to turn up, but to the
rest of you I say 'Get there early'.
This show always sells out even
though we hold it in the largest
capacity room in college. (The
Great Hall dummy!). Audience
participation is half of the fun but
we have to stress that only people
over the age of eighteen can be
admitted and we hold no
responsibility for those of nervous
disposition or expectant mothers!
Rag Bash.
Yep, another party and almost the
end of Rag Week. Yet again R A G
comes to the Union Building with
live bands, a disco and a bit of a
party. Bar extension will be
operating for your convenience and
at only a couple of quid it's bound
to be the cheapest place to go this
Friday.
SNKPJ
Watch crazy people streaking from
Harrods back to College, trying not
to get arrested on the way. Last
year, Steve Farrant and Paul
Thomas got 'picked up' (in a
manner of speaking) by the
Diplomatic Police, who gave them
a lift back to the Union. Serves
them right for strolling back
wearing nothing but bowties! This
year Rachel, R A G Chair, aims to
be the first female student to
undertake this task but only if she
can get sponsored over £300. A
prize is on offer for the last person
back, so who dares wins.
ag Rugby
See next page for sports news.
ve-legged
b crawl
Fed up with boring pub crawls?
Well this is a pub crawl with a
difference. Y o u need to get
yourselves into teams of about four
and tie yourselves together. Hey
presto, a five legged pub crawl. Off
you go with a collecting can and
some money with the aim to be the
team that visits the most pubs or
raises the most money. No previous
experience necessary. Turn up in
your teams at 7.00pm in the union
bar, ready to leave at 7.30pm.
Film Evening
A comedy filmshow with cartoons
and films held in the concert hall.
Watch out for the special Filmsoc
posters to find out what films are
on and turn up for a night of laughs.
Beer Festival
Calling all pissheads, real ale fans,
cheapskates, students... in fact
anyone who likes a pint. This event
is the biggest non-CAMRA beer
festival in the country, and basically
involves lots of people spending the
whole afternoon drinking lots of
different beers in the comfort and
safety of the JCR. Also the beer
festival marks the launch of this
year's version of IC's notorious
