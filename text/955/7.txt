Geoff Maxwell looks at London's new hospital.
Amidst the indignant reactions to
the Tomlinson Report, a new 660
bed hospital opened on Monday.
Located on Fulham Road, within
easy reach of the Brompton and
Royal Marsden Hospitals, it may
well put the final nail in the coffin
of Charing Cross.
The architects, Sheperd Robson,
have challenged the oppressive
atmosphere of most hospitals by
creating vast internal courtyards
linked along the length of the
building. Initially this seems a
curious use of limited, and costly,
ground space. However there are
advantages to this approach. Most
of the rooms have windows either
into a courtyard or out to the real
world, communication between
departments and wards is facilitated
by the open walkways and 60% of
the building will be naturally
air-conditioned.
The size of the courtyards
actually decreases as you descend
through the building, such that the
lower ground floor is nearly solid.
They give a feel of size and space
throughout the building without
requiring expensive and energy
inefficient external walls.
At night time .the pastel blue
shades and lighting give a chilled
tone, but the warmth of daylight
falling into the courtyards should
make it much more inviting.
The overall impression is not
dissimilar to the larger modern
American prisons. Hopefully the
hospital will come alive as the
wards open and the walkways bustle
with patients and staff.
There are some extraordinary,
even bizarre, details—a vivid
yellow hut, with a green corrugated
roof, looks as though it has been
dropped into one of the open
spaces. Aside from comments about
the workmen leaving their site hut
behind, it seems that it serves as the
'Sanctuary of Unity', or multi-faith
temple.
The X-ray department, equipped
with the latest imaging and scanning
machine, seemed rather short on
windows. This is not helped by
bright orange walls, even in the
waiting area.
The best view of London, so we
were informed, is from one of the
operating theatres—I suppose the
patients will appreciate the surgeon
enjoying the view half-way through
an operation!
If there are not too many suicides
off the high walkway, it should
prove a practical and fairly pleasant
hospital.
