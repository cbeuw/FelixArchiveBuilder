On a bike and a prayer
In the second part of the voyage across the Atlas mountains, Chris Riley
arrives in Rain and commences the journey proper.
Rich lay some seventy kilometres
to the south across flat open plains
with brain-numbingly straight roads
and wind swept rides to oblivion -
an agoraphobic's nightmare.
Telegraph poles stretched across the
panorama and huge smeared rain
clouds smudged grey across a vast
blue sky - promising rain that never
reached the dusty earth.
Young Berber children in flocks
of inquisition swarmed from the
countryside legs tripping and
stumbling, arms and grubby hands
blurred in frantic waves. Old men
swept them aside and they returned
moments later like drifting piles of
Autumn leaves. Small settlements
of squatting red plastered buildings
sat chameleon like in the buff plains
of tundra and cacti. Our hotel was
the taller one of the only two in
town. We stored our bikes in the
bar downstairs beneath a T V set
showing the Tokyo games. The
room upstairs was compact and airy
and we dined on the roof that night
under a single moth shrouded lamp.
It took another three days and two
uncomfortable nights on the open
road to reach Imilchil. Compared
to what we had seen en route for the
last few days, it was positively a
sprawling metropolis, with 15,000
people, large market places and
boundless hotels and cafes. The
building we choose to stay in was
pleasant and cool and rested behind
a castle of mud and dung. There
was a French photographer there
who'd been capturing the faces of
the local people for over two years
in timeless black and white
masterpieces. The little inn was run
by a couple of young boys who
were helped out by numerous
trekking guides. Their uncle owned
the place, but was in prison for
disagreeing with the local mafia-
style corrupt authorities.
We were strongly advised to take
a guide with us. Not only because
they were there to make money out
of people like us, but because it was
a long way to the next village,
across raw mountain with few
recognisable tracks, with little to
guide and a lot of potential for
getting lost. To chew over the idea,
we stripped our bikes of all luggage
and climbed up to Lake Tizlit to
watch the sun setting. It we were
told was a mysterious lake stooped '
in legend of kings, forbidden
marriages and Romeo and Juliet
style tragedies. The little reservoir
style puddle we discovered was
more like an East Anglian pleasure-
boating lake.
The intense heat we had been
hiding from all day was now
disappearing faster than the sun. In
a chilly twilight we swerved and
bounced on our bikes like slalom
skiers towards the little burning
fires of Imilchil. As we passed a
herd of goats and some tiny scruffy
children, I slowed down and
The view from Rain in deepest
scooped one out of the dust. He
clung speechless and grinning as he
squatted side saddle on my cross
bar, his little warty hands clutching
the handle bars and occasionally
grabbing at his bobble hat to push
it out from his eyes. He greeted new
knots of children at the side of the
road like a little king, gabbling for
them to join the rabble of chuckling,
stumbling kids behind.
We ate oily omelette and bread
that night. Whilst Stephane quizzed
Said - one of the guides - about the
route, I went off for a stroll.
Hassan, another guide joined me at
a distance to act as a guard. Near
the market square I found a man
who had lectured at the School of
Oriental and African Studies
(SOAS) in London, between 1974
and 1984. He asked me how the city
was now, and we swapped
comments on the place. The very
edge of town seemed to be
Morocco
populated by women and young
girls. Hassan suggested I marry all
the single ones!
As I walked away, all the young
girls lined up near a wall and
clapped, as they swayed their hips
and sang 'Donnez-moi un
dirham.... donnez moi un dirham'
(give me a dirham - the unit of
Moroccan currency). They came
scuttling after me, sucking other
bystanders into the throng, until I
was surrounded like a Queen Bee.
One little girl, her arms open wide
begged me to take her with me. I
scooped her up and carried her
through the crowds back into town.
She clung like a tiny pipistrelle bat
and I wished I could take her
further. Taking a last look at her
soft brown eyes I put her down in
a doorway and turned my back on
the children of Imilchil as the rain
fell on the mud brick streets.
Next, the mountains take their toll
