FilmSoc
Rockford Peaches.
Despite being a success on the
field, Dottie is soon accused by her
sister of overshadowing her and the
film deals with this and the other
trials and tribulations the team have
to face.
Besides the great acting of Davis
and Hanks the film not only has a
lot of deft comic touches and
marvellous one-liners, but also
disproves the old adage that
Madonna and films don't mix.
The film will be shown, as usual,
in Mech Eng 220 on Thursday 4th
February at 7.30pm. Membership
is now down to only £3.50 with the
first film free. Otherwise entry is
90p for members and £1.90 for
non-members.
Next week, FilmSoc is proud to
present A League of Their Own, the
massive box office hit from last
year, starring Geena Davis, Tom
Hanks and Madonna.
Directed by Penny Marshall, who
also helmed Big, the comedy
concerns the fortunes of a women's
baseball team in the 1940s in
Chicago, formed because most of
the male players are away, fighting
the war.
Davis plays 'Dottie' Hinson, a
woman thrust into the world of
professional baseball after being
spotted, along with her sister, Kit,
played by Llri Petty, by a talent
scout. Hanks plays a down and out
former baseball player responsible
for managing the team that Davis
and Madonna are part of, The
All Change
The first week of displays and
coffee-bar is now over (but, due to
popular demand will be up in Mech
Eng concourse all next week, 1-5
Feb).
More talks/presentations are
planned for both lunchtimes and
evenings—the main focus being on
Friday 5th Feb at 6pm, Huxley 308
(follow the arrows) under the title
of 'One World, One God?', a truly
international occasion with food!
For further details look out for
the posters or contact me, Ben
Quant, Biochem 3 (081-743 4736).

Wine tasting
A L L - C H A N C E
The ICU Wine Tasting Society
began the new term with a look at
the wines of South West France, a
region displaying a variety of wines
produced in climates varying from
chilly mountain slopes to
Mediterranean-warmed coastal
vineyards.
Membership of the Wine Society
has now been reduced to £5 for the
rest of the year and already this
term's tastings include.
26th Jan—Calvados (high in
alcohol, sweet in taste)
9th Feb—Australia (typically big,
bold and fruity wines)
16th Feb—Valentine's Sparkling
Wines.
Finally, the Lamberhurst
vineyard, in Kent, is the proposed
destination of this year's Wine Soc
Easter Trip—a guided tour of the
vineyard and cellars will finish with
a wine and liqueur tasting and a
FREE tasting glass! Further details,
may be obtained at the meetings,
but it's virtually guaranteed to be a
good day out (likely date Sat 27th
March).
ICU Wine Soc meet every
Tuesday evening at 6pm in the
Union Building. Membership is
now £5 and each tasting costs £4.
All welcome.
