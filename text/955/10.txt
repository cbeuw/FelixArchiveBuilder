James Evans sings the praises of
PhotoSoc and their exhibitions
On Monday February 1st the
College's most prolific
exhibitionists present the
Photographic Society 1993
Exhibition. This is the most exciting
year so far, with sixty new
professional frames and more
photographers participating than
ever before! The reception takes
place between 5.30pm and 8.30pm,
while those who want to reflect on
the pictures at their leisure have the
whole of February to do so. It is
held in the Consort Gallery, the
room next door to the main dining
hall in the Sherfield Building.
So what are we all about? Most
people take photographs, and most
are dissapointed with the results
they get, the perfect picture from
the imagination rarely ends up on
the print! There is a solution:
develop the photographs yourself,
and use more creative darkroom
skills to enhance your pictures.
There are over seventy
photographers in the Society, so
there is a lot of advice and shared
experience to be had. The basics are
quite easy to learn: some of the
pictures in the exhibition were taken
by people who had only started in
photography this year!
You will see a large variety of
individual styles on show in the
exhibition, almost all of which were
printed at the Society darkroom
(mostly last week!) We can teach
you how to devlop Black and White
films cheaply and make prints from
negatives (colour and black and
white), and from slides. We can
also teach toning of prints (sepia,
selenium etc). The darkroom has
stocks of film which we buy in
bulk, so that you can develop your
own style without breaking the
bank!
We've also started a new venture:
Guest Speakers. Last week the
Ilford young journalist of the year
- Greg Williams - came to talk about
his life as a photojournalist. He is
only twenty, but has already
travelled to Burma, ex-Yugoslavia,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique and
Tanzania, with a trip to India
planned in the near future. His
photographs for Oxfam feature in
their current advertising campaign,
while he has also had his pictures
published in the Times,
Independant, Guardian, Telegraph
and German magazines. Greg plans
to make a return visit, and to come
to the exhibition.
So come to the opening reception
on first February from 5.30 pm.
Take your time over the pictures
and have another look later in the
week. Some of the pictures have
instant appeal, while others take
time and thought. If you want to
know about joining the
Photographic Society and future
events, please drop a note in my
pigeonhole (MechEng Undergrad),
or see us in the Southside Lounge
at 1.00 pm on Tuesdays.
