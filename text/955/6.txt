It is more than just the mouth-watering dishes, graceful
traditional dances, sensational sketches etc...
It is more than just trying to bring about better mutual
understanding and promoting cultural interactions amongst the
Malaysians and all nationalities.
We have made a promise:
Should any profit be made, a significant part of it will go
to benefitting selected charity groups and benevolent funds,
both of this country and Malaysia.
This promise cannot be realised by the effort of a few warm
souls alone but generosity from people like YOU
