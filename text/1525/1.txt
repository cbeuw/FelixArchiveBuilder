Possible A&E changes
Plans have been made to close the
Accident and Emergency depart-
ments of both Charing Cross and
Hammersmith hospitals. Instead,
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
will be made the main A&E depart-
ment for the area and will be ex-
panded to handle the extra patients
from the borough. Other hospitals
that will be affected by these chang-
es are Ealing, Central Middlesex,
and West Middlesex.
Charing Cross hospital is well
known for its hyper-acute stroke
unit which will be moved to St.
Mary’s as NHS bosses say that they
need to site hyper acute stroke units
evenly across London to minimise
journey times. Hammersmith and
Fulham Council’s community care
cabinet member Marcus Ginn said
“Moving the world class stroke unit
from Charing Cross to St Mary’s is
madness”.
In a public consultation that began
July 2nd and will end October 6th,
people can vote out of three choices.
As shown in the picture on page 4,
the three options show that Ham-
mersmith will become a specialist
hospital. Option A and Option C
show Charing Cross becoming a lo-
cal hospital and Chelsea and West-
minster becoming a Major hospital.
At this point, it seems that Option A
may be most likely.
If these changes go ahead it is
would leave 700,000 people without
an A&E in their area. The Chelsea
and Fulham MP, Greg Hands, stated
his concerns about how this would
affect patient care. Talking to Felix,
he said “it’s difficult to see how the
Chelsea and Westminster hospital
will cope with a massive influx of
patients… and getting to Chelsea
may be difficult and, potentially, life-
threatening for many of my constitu-
ents in Fulham. Traffic in our part of
London is bad at the best of times,
but we all know how gridlocked
things can become. What happens
when the roads are closed for foot-
ball at Chelsea FC is anyone’s guess.
We know that ambulances will take
longer to reach patients and longer
to get them to a hospital with the
right specialism. For stroke, that

will involve going all the way to St
Mary’s.”
Opposition to the move called
Save our Hospitals that have been
organising events and meet-ups,
will be marching tomorrow Saturday
6th October from Shepherds Bush
to Charing Cross to protest against
the closure of West London’s A&Es.
Other opposition groups have start-
ed online petitions that have gath-
ered up to 6216 signatures to save
Charing Cross Hospital and 1499
signatures to save Hammersmith
hospital.
Hammersmith and Fulham’s La-
bour MP, Andy Slaughter, said on
his website that he was told the “un-
believable news that Chelsea and
Westminster Hospital is campaign-
ing for closure of Charing Cross. I
am writing to the Chair to ask him
stop immediately. I know of no other
instance of a hospital actively cam-
paigning to have another hospital
closed. The trust is actually distrib-
uting postcards, asking patients to
vote for Option A – which closes
Charing Cross!” He mentioned
his disapproval over the proposed
changes as they are “ruining the
NHS” and that “the damage had al-
ready gone too far and must be re-
sisted”.
If the Imperial NHS Trust be-
comes a Founda-
tion Trust, they
