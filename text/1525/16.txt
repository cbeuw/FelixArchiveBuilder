21 million adult
cod left in the
North Sea
Fishing for the facts
There’s plenty more fish in the sea – or are there?
nly 100 adult cod in
North Sea’; ‘Just 100
cod left in North
Sea’; ‘Just 100 ma-
ture ﬁsh in North
Sea’ are but three of the headlines
published by The Sunday Times, The
Telegraph Online, and The Sun re-
spectively, a little over two weeks ago.
One is not required to be a ﬁsherman
or marine conservationist to stop and
question such bold headlines, vari-
ations of which have been bandied
about by several American and Cana-
dian news outlets. Whilst the popu-
lation of Northern White Rhinoceri
can be written with a single digit, are
North Sea cod really on the brink of
extinction? How did these newspa-
pers come up with such a ﬁgure – and
was there any truth behind their ex-
traordinary claims?
The newspapers were in fact tech-
nically correct. The issue stemmed
from a misunderstanding by journal-
ists over data. In the case of The Sun-
day Times, this data came from the
International Council for the Explo-
ration of the Sea (ICES), before jour-
nalists turned to the Centre for Envi-
ronment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science (Cefas) for additional advice.
The Sunday Times deemed an ‘adult
cod’ to be thirteen years of age, due
to the fact that most North Sea cod
could apparently live up to twenty-
ﬁve years. Thus, it was logically as-
sumed that a thirteen year-old cod
would be roughly half-way through
its life. Using this gauge the data
backed up their headline: by looking
at the data and how many cod over
thirteen years of age had been caught
over the year, it was estimated that
around 100 ‘adult’ cod remained.
Worrying? Hardly.
For North Sea cod thirteen years of
age is old. Very old. To use a crude
comparison, it would be similar to
claiming the human adult population
was approximately 500,000, basing
the deﬁnition of ‘adult’ as someone
being over 100 years of age. In fact,
North Sea cod are sexually mature at
six years old – the point they could
reasonably be called adults, several
years oﬀ thirteen. So where did the
twenty-ﬁve year lifespan ﬁgure come
from?
The estimate was taken from ﬁsh-
base.org. And, indeed, cod have been
estimated to live for up to twenty-
ﬁve years – in the Barents Sea, north
of Norway and Russia, that is. For
North Sea cod life expectancy is less
than half that, at an estimated eleven
years.
Given the relevant information, The
Sunday Times headline could be cor-
rected with a simple number change:
‘Only 21 million adult cod in the
North Sea’ would be a more accurate,
if not thoroughly unspectacular, rep-
resentation of the data. Whilst it is
clear that overﬁshing is an issue to be
addressed, the problem is not as dire
as the overly simplistic Sunday Times
headline made it out to be, and the
paper has since made amends. Un-
fortunately the story has since spread
and helped perpetrate the myth that
overﬁshing has caused cod stocks to
crash most spectacularly.
In this case the poor handling of
data spawned a story so startling that
it was almost impossible to avoid fur-
ther scrutiny, resulting in the expo-
sure of inadequate investigative jour-
nalism. But not all stories are so bold
in their assertions that it’s obvious
mistakes have been made along the
line. It’s strongly encouraged regular
readers of scientiﬁc news take every-
thing with a pinch of salt, and ques-
tion what you read, a trait that will
set you in good stead for the future.
After all, ‘The 100 cod’ ﬁasco isn’t the
world’s ﬁrst piece of poor scientiﬁc
journalism, and it certainly won’t be
the last.
