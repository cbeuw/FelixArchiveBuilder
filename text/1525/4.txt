Petitions created against
the proposed changes
On Tuesday 2nd October, there was an
incident in one of the Department of
Chemical Engineering’s laboratories in
the Bone Building on the South Kens-
ington Campus.
Prince Consort Road was brieﬂy cor-
nered oﬀ and students in the Union had
to leave via the exit on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
the Union building.
The Fire Brigade were called, as were
the police. This was reportedly due to a
possibility of an explosion, however that
has not been conﬁrmed to be true. It
was all said to be precautionary meas-
ures.
At this point there were multiple ac-
counts and rumours as to what had hap-
pened, with the ﬁre brigade dispersing
the crowd that had brieﬂy formed on the
Royal Albert Hall steps. The bottom of
the steps were also included in the area
cornered oﬀ. A man in a white lab coat
could be seen being questioned by the
Fire Brigade by the side of the building.
It was conﬁrmed on Thursday 4th
October by the College that the ﬁre has
“caused substantial damage to a fume
cupboard”
. It was added that “the cause
of the ﬁre is currently being investigated
however it is thought that the incident
arose during the changing of a hydrogen
cylinder”
.
The Fire Brigade handed the space
back to the College this morning. There
were no injuries of any kind.

FRIDAY 5 OCTOBER
lions. The land value for Charing
Cross Hospital is exceedingly large
as anyone who buys the land will be
able to build up to the same height as
the building that they knock down,
which would be fourteen stories for
Charing Cross Hospital.
The main difference between a
Primary Healthcare Trust and a
Healthcare trust is that a Primary
Healthcare Trust can keep the prof-
its they make, whereas a Healthcare
trust must reinvest their profits into
the system.
The Imperial NHS trust has al-
ready been under fire over its re-
cord handling and this questions the
competence of the trust as a whole
and its ability to manage such dra-
matic changes to patient care. Greg
Hands said that ‘the whole process
is in danger of being driven by land
values and the Trust’s ambitions in-
stead of the best care for patients
across West London’.
Greg Hands continued on to say
that “making sure there is 24/7 cover
from consultants is obviously good;
leaving an entire London borough
without an A&E is not. At the mo-
ment, this seems to be about Impe-
rial NHS Trust’s needs, not patients’
needs. I am fighting hard to change
that”.
Medical students of Imperial Col-
lege London use both hospitals for
teaching, and concerns have been
made as to how this will affect Impe-
rial medics. If the plans go through
Charing Cross will no longer be a
teaching hospital, which will have a
big impact on the way medicine is
taught at Imperial. ICSM President,
Shiv Vohra, commented saying: “At
the moment students are in the dark
as to what the proposals will mean
for their future education, and would
like to be kept in the loop about the
planned changes and how it will af-
fect them. Particularly in relation to
the Charing Cross hospital, which is
the hub of the medical school.”
Felix asked a spokeswoman from
Imperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust, about whether the changes
would have a positive or negative ef-
fect on education. In her response
she mentioned that, “the three op-
tions will affect the Trust in differ-
ing ways and as a consultee the Trust
is considering what the propos-
als mean for our services, staff and
sites. We have agreed with Imperial
College London that we will formu-
late a joint response as an Academic
Health Science Centre (AHSC) as it
is crucial that the feedback includes
how these proposals will affect the
AHSC’s tripartite mission of vastly
improving healthcare through ser-
vice, education and research.”
With the public consultation end-
ing on 6th October and the proposed
changes taking up to three years to
be implemented, it could be a while
before the exact effects to medical
students and patients is known.
