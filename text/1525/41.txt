here’s no denying it, folks.
Imperial College Lon-
don has you in its vice-
like grip for the next ten
weeks or so. With pro-
jects to do and reports to write, it can
sometimes be hard to stay entertained
when you’ve got a word limit to hit
(a lot like this column right here, I’m
dangerously bored already). This eter-
nal conundrum has now been solved
thanks to the establishment of the
Coﬀee Break Lab Report Word Hunt
Challenge 2012TM
!
Below, we’ve given you a list of
words, names, and expressions. Try
and slip any of these into any of your
upcoming assignments. We’ll pick out
the best examples at some point in the
future. A word of pretty obvious warn-
ing: don’t sacriﬁce your work ethos for
the sake of handing in a blank sheet
of A4 with ‘Robert Mugabe‘ written
over and over again on it. Unless that
is your assignment, and then I wish
you well with your hugely interesting
degree choice.
Additionally, for any markers who
pick up on any stray words, let us
know! Send your stuﬀ to felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk. If you have any lame/fan-
tastic ideas that you feel might work
spectacularly in these pages, let us
know!
