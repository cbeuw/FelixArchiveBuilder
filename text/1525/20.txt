The summer of 2012 has been a stun-
ning exhibition of top quality sports,
as world-class athletes congregated in
London for an unforgettable Olympics
and arguably the best ever Paralympics.
An intriguing Euro 2012 was showcased
earlier in the summer in Eastern Europe,
and this trio of gargantuan sporting fes-
tivals were bookended by the Wimble-
don and US Open Grand Slams. Many
would think that this is set to continue
into September with the T20 World Cup
held in Sri Lanka, but in reality the Tam-
ils that inhabit the Northern and East-
ern parts of the country and the Tamil
diaspora have plenty of reason to think
otherwise.
Questions are once again being raised
as to why the International Cricket
Council has permitted Sri Lanka not
only to participate but also to host one
of the sport’s most prestigious tourna-
ments, especially with the on-going alle-
gations of human rights abuses and war
crimes against the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
This essential role bestowed upon Sri
Lanka legitimises and condones a coun-
try that is in dire circumstances.
The Government and many distin-
guished individuals argue that this can
help towards the reconciliation between
thedisplacedTamilsofSriLankaandthe
majority Sinhalese population. When
explored further, however, the idea that
sport can heal the growing rift between
the two races simply seems nonsensical.
Sport is far too trivial to gloss over the
deaths of tens of thousands of civilians
and to overcome the racial discrimina-
tion that Tamils have been and still are
subjected to.
The argument is that sport, and its
associated celebrations, could be used
as a tool to heal the rifts between dif-
ferent parts of society and induce a
sense of camaraderie and team spirit.
However with the continued failure of
the Sri Lankan Government’s Lessons
Learnt and Reconciliation Commission
(LLRC) to provide accountability for
the 40,000 lives lost in the ﬁnal days of
the civil war (as mentioned in the UN
Panel of Experts report), is it justiﬁed
for this country to host such a sporting
event? By failing to revoke out-of-date
emergency laws and preventing media
organisations from entering the north-
ern and eastern parts of the country,
the Government has embarked upon
greater militarisation and colonisation
of these areas. Consequently humanitar-
ian organisations have reported ongoing
human rights abuses which can only
undo and devastate the supposed heal-
ing eﬀects that the T20 World Cup can
provide.
Undoubtedly, senior government
politicians see this as a way to mask
the crimes committed by the Govern-
ment, rather than something heading in
the direction of reconciliation, derived
Cricket: a tool for reconciliation?

Why sport and politics cannot be separated
from accountability. On Sri Lanka’s ‘new
brand’ Nivard Cabraal, the central bank
Governor, stated: “I am conﬁdent that
this trend will continue in the future
and those so-called international calls
for [war crimes] investigation will fade
away.”
Mindsets such as these further prove
thattheSriLankanGovernmentareloth
to make a genuine attempt to investigate
and bring justice to the victims of the
war. This unwillingness further demon-
strates the insincerity and casual nature
of the Government towards the resolu-
tion passed by the humans rights coun-
cil, asking for the Government’s own
recommendations on the situation, and
a timeframe in which they can be car-
ried out. One should enquire whether
the T20 World Cup will be utilised as
a way to unite a fragmented country or
merely as an exercise in distracting the
international community from the grave
problems the country faces.
As stated by Charu Lata Hogg, the Sri
LankaexpertattheLondonbasedthink-
tank Chatham House: “Hosting an inter-
national sporting event will not deﬂect
international attention on its core hu-
man rights responsibilities.”
Beyond this, applying the view that
sports and politics have nothing to do
with one another is simply indiﬀerent
and very dismissive. This could not be
further from the truth. As Archbishop
Desmond Tutu has said: “It is a myth to
say that sports and politics do not mix.”
The Sri Lankan cricket board is inter-
twined with the Government to its very
core, to the point that the members of
the cricket boards are selected by means
of political pressure and direct inter-
vention from the government. Many
questionable selections have been made
by the cricket board; as recently as last
year, Sanath Jayasuriya was called up to
the national team. There has been much
debate about whether this was down to
his political standing or his now declin-
ing sporting ability. With all these allega-
tions of Government controlled selec-
tions of the national team being made,
we can break down the idea that the Sri
Lankan state and cricket within Sri Lan-
ka are unconnected.
Moreover the same army that has
been accused of the heinous war crimes
in Sri Lanka is responsible for the main-
tenance and the running of the three
largest cricket stadiums. The links be-
tween what should be an amazing fes-
tival of cricket and the ongoing human
rights abuses occurring within the coun-
try are clear, and calls for a cricketing
boycott of Sri Lanka should be voiced,
until genuine and signiﬁcant attempts
are made by the Sri Lankan government
to follow the resolution and bring about
reconciliation through justice. Through
this many avid cricket fans can enjoy a
less politically inﬂuenced world cup.
Calls for the exclusion of Sri Lanka
from cricket should not be seen as too
robust or excessive; in fact, sport has
been helpful in bringing about changes
to countries with dire situations, most
notably South Africa. In that case, the
United Nations created a “Register of
Sports Contacts with South Africa”
which put the spotlight on sporting stars
that were unwilling to stay away from
Apartheid South Africa. Many inter-
national sporting bodies banned South
Africa from participating until it ﬁnally
gave way to the end of Apartheid.
More recently, Desmond Tutu, a ﬁg-
ure key to this South African boycott,
once again called out for English cricket-
ers to avoid competing with Zimbabwe
until a political change was brought
about and Robert Mugabe was taken out
ofpower:“Ibelievethatasigniﬁcantpart
of the population in Zimbabwe would
say [the cricketers] should not be here,
because you are lending a legitimacy
and respectability to a country that is in
a shambles because of one person.”
Many parallels can be drawn between
Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka where the T20
World Cup is “lending a legitimacy and
respectability to a country that is in a
shambles.”
Sports fans and cricket fans across the
globe have every right to question what
initially appeared to be unnecessary calls
for exclusion or boycott of the World
Cup. However there are evident links
between the Sri Lankan cricket board
and a government that has engaged in
numerous war crimes. The T20 World
Cup might have started but the time to
take a stand against Sri Lanka is never
too late. One can only hope that the
governments and cricket boards of the
participating countries will realise that
humanitarian issues should take prec-
edence over sporting ones.
