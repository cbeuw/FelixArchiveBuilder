To commemorate the beginning of the
new term, Felix Puzzles is relatively
pleased to announce the arrival of our
new Kakuro puzzle.
It’s not that complex... we hope. The
name of the game is to insert a digit
from 1 to 9 into all of the white cells,
so that the total of each row or column
adds up to the corresponding number
in the grey cells. But watch out! Each
row or column cannot featuring re-
peating digits. To get you started, we’ve
given you a couple of digits.
We’re gearing up towards bringing
back all of your old favourites, but in
order to speed up the process it’d be
great to have a few Puzzles Command-
ers on hand. If you’re interested in
crafting ﬁendish challenges and gener-
ally messing about on a Mac whenever
you want, email felix@imperial.ac.uk.

SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots.
The numbers in each square in-
dicate how many edges of the
square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting
a week to see the solution will
also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, as the
puzzles team recieves one kiss on
the cheek per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
