oris Johnson does some-
thing funny, isn’t he
great!” seems to be the
standard title for news
stories about the man. Its
like “Jim’s dad dresses up as Elvis, hi-
larious”; but I feel like Jim. Whilst some
people find him hilarious and willingly
vote for him, I think: “Oh God, I have to
put up with this on a day-to-day basis.”
I can’t even escape him when I go home
to Norway: damned Olympics. And
then he started dancing at the closing
ceremony: that drunk-middle-aged-
dad-at-a-wedding-dance (not for the
faint of heart).
That I was never a fan of him or Con-
servatism in the first place probably
doesn’t help, but I was quite detached
from him until I started at Imperial in
2010, thinking of him as more of an idiot
who I could ignore completely. From
then on, as I increasingly identified Lon-
don as somewhere I lived rather than
just a place where I studied, I came to
realise just how much of a buffoon he
was (or was pretending to be), and just
how much he was getting on my nerves.
It increasingly becomes a case of
other people finding him hilarious, and
it infuriates me like it would Jim. It re-
minds me (Jim) of just how darned an-
noying he is, and just how annoying it is
to have to constantly put up with him,
not being able to go a day without be-
ing reminded of why I didn’t vote for
him (Jim wishing before going to sleep
every night that he had a normal dad).
All the other kids find Jim’s dad’s eccen-
tricity hilarious, which infuriates him

orgive me, reader, if you’ve
reached Olympic satura-
tion point over the sum-
mer. No doubt I would have
done so long ago, had I not
spent a large part of those two weeks
in a lecture theatre in The Nether-
lands. Utrecht train station, I excit-
edly discovered, had a large screen TV
showing the Games. I stationed myself
in front of the screen, keen to catch up
on all the action…
But wait. Horses? Music? Horses
dancing to music? “Is this some kind
of hoax?” I asked the lady who was sat
next to me. However she reassured
me that this was indeed “dressage“, an
Olympic sport. Perplexed, I continued
watching. Dressage undoubtedly re-
quires a certain amount of skill (from
both rider and horse), but is no spec-
tator sport. Each act looked the same
to me (yet bewilderingly collected dif-
ferent scores). And each rider looked
the same on horseback (indeed it was
only after a while that I noticed that
some were male and some were fe-
male).
The event that followed was some-
thing called “BMX” which, I should
explain to those who have yet to have
the dubious pleasure of watching it,
involves riding very small bikes over
artiﬁcial hills. Despite it being easy
enough to work out who is winning,
there is still not much that BMX has
to oﬀer to the non-bloodthirsty spec-
tator; it is fairly common for only a
handful of the competitors to com-
plete the race, the rest suﬀering pain-
ful injury on the way.
Call me old fashioned, but I yearned
for a good old running or jumping
contest. However, my prayers went
unanswered, as we migrated from
BMX to women’s boxing. A British
lady was in the ﬁnal and so patriotism
dictated that I willed her to punch her
opponent in the face as hard as pos-
sible. Extraordinary. I don’t call that
sport.
So what sport should be in the
Olympics instead? Certainly there
are many worthy contenders, but the
one that springs to my mind is squash.
Although excluded now and in 2016,
it surely has more appeal to both the
player and the spectator. The average
person is far more likely to have tried

How I despair at Boris’ slightly annoying antics
squash than dancing on a horse or
punching someone in the face. They
are also more likely to infer who is
winning and what constitutes good
play. Furthermore squash is a game of
speed, grace and tactics; a game that
depends on the skill of the player and
not of an animal also.
The Olympics are inspiring and free
advertisements for lots of diﬀerent
sports. What a pity that it was sports
like dressage, BMX and boxing, and
not others like squash, that were ad-
vertised this time around.

London’s embarrassing dad

further because they don’t realise what
it’s like to have to put up with it all the
time, and seem oblivious to the fact that
Jim has good reason for hating it all.
Anyway, Boris Johnson does a good
job of doing ‘hilarious to many, em-
barrassing to some’ things, just like an
eccentric dad for whom – “Dad, don’t
walk too close to me.” “But why? I’m
funny aren’t I?” “No.” – is a daily con-
versation with the begrudging child
(who is then passed off as a miserable
git).
But then, this may just be me acting
a bit too much like a disgruntled teen-
ager. Or maybe Boris is!
