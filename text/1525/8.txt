Land’s End
Time to rest my bones
This summer,
Kadhim Shubber
raised £3,000 for
Imperial scholarships
by cycling from John
O’Groats to Land’s End
on a tandem...
with a skeleton
he last day was bliss. My
parents had driven down
to Cornwall and had tak-
en the bags oﬀ our bikes;
after two weeks, we ﬁnal-
ly had a support car. With the weight
removed from my beleaguered back
wheel, the tandem was a dream. I sped
up the hills, my now mutant thighs
making short work of the climbs, and
then ﬂew down the other side, enjoy-
ing gears I hadn’t realised existed be-
fore. The Claud Butler racing tandem,
the “Majestic Two”, was ﬁnally getting
to spread its wings. The sun was out,
and King Arthur (the skeleton) was
getting to feel the wind in his… chest
cavity. We arrived at Land’s End in no
time.
Most days weren’t like that. No sir,
most days weren’t like that at all.
It all started at some point in
September or October last year. I
was derping around on the Internet,
when I stumbled upon a site called
‘RecordSetter’. It’s kind of like a
crowd-sourced Guinness Book of
Records. You choose your record, you
record yourself doing it, and if the
RecordSetter community decides that
it’s legit: hey presto, you’re a world
record holder.
I was impressed. I tweeted some-
thing obnoxious at them, like “ZOMG
awesome website bro!” They replied
suggesting that I try to set a record.
They suggested trying to break one
of their cycling records. I found one,
set in 1987 by an American called Art
Hoﬀman. He had cycled 437 miles on
a tandem with a skeleton on the back
to raise awareness about the dan-
gers of smoking. “I could beat that,”
I thought, and thus started down a
path that would lead to me standing
on Dartmoor in the middle of a storm,
staring down a great big horned cow,
with a tandem and skeleton in tow.
My preparations for the cycle were
abysmal. Pretty much the only use-
ful thing I did was persuade Sioni, an
experienced cyclist, to come with me.
People would ask me, “How’s train-
ing going?” and I would laugh, say
“Errr, not bad” and then make a men-
tal note to lie more convincingly next
time. Before setting oﬀ on the trip, I
had been on the tandem fewer than
ten times. And no more than three of
those times were with the skeleton. I
had never in my life cycled more than
50 km in one day. Simply put, I had no
idea if the bikes, the skeleton, or my
body would last the entire journey, or
make it in the time we allotted.
I quickly discovered that the bike
was much too small for me; that the
handlebars were atrociously uncom-
fortable; and that even a Brooks sad-
dle will do horrendous things to your
backside if you haven’t broken it in.
There wasn’t really a point, you
see, where I had made a conscious
decision to do this cycle. I thought
it would be cool to break a record; I
thought it would be fun to cycle John
O’Groats to Land’s End; it felt right to
raise money for Imperial scholarships,
to help other people have the oppor-
tunity to attend the university that had
given me so much. But to be honest,
when I found myself in possession of
a borrowed skeleton and a tandem, I
thought, “Oh dear, I’m actually going
to have to do this now” – it felt churl-
ish at that point to turn back.
And boy were there a lot of times
when I wanted to turn back, to stop,
to sack it all in. The two hazy, fever-
aﬄicted days in and around Hereford-
shire; when Arthur snapped at the
spine and I had to carry him on my
back for 30 miles; every time I went up
a hill; every time I came down a valley
and understood that, like a Lannister,
I would have pay that debt back on the
other side. And, of course, I wanted to
turn back when I encountered cow-
zilla on Dartmoor.
It probably wasn’t a good idea to try
and cycle across Dartmoor. I mean,
nothing about cycling the entire length
of the UK with your mate’s skeleton on
a tandem from the 80s is a good idea.
But cycling across Dartmoor in par-
ticular was a dreadful idea.
The rain wasn’t falling from the
sky. It was shooting across the moor
into my face as if some great big ﬁre-
man was spraying his hose across the
landscape (eww). The wind wasn’t
just blowing, it was straight up sucker
punching me in the gut when I least
expected it. The hills weren’t just… ok,
you get the idea.
But whilst I could deal with being
so soaked that I had abandoned the
thought that I might ever be dry again,
I couldn’t deal with a great big cow
suddenly appearing out of the fog in
the middle of the road. Sioni was far
ahead in the distance; the two deaf cy-
clists we had passed earlier were sure-
ly far behind; and here I was alone,
