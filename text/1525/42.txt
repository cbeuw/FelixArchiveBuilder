Dark and gritty reboot
for Imperial College
ollowing Hollywood’s re-
cent trend of rebooting
ﬁlm franchises, an anony-
mous source revealed yes-
terday that there is a “5%
chance” that Imperial College London
is “probably considering” a similar
reboot in order to “bring a feeling of
true misery to both staﬀ and students
alike”.
“When you reboot anything – a ﬁlm
franchise, a university, the economy,
for example – the resulting tone is al-
ways unrelentingly horrible,” our fedo-
ra-wearing source said on Thursday.
“The example I always like to use to
reassure people is the Harry Potter
ﬁlm series. We all know that it’s only
a matter of time before they remake
it, and believe me, by the time we get
to Goblet of Fire the characters will be
getting pregnant and shooting up her-
oin all over Hogwarts. And then even
the Goblet of Fire will probably be a
dirty pint or something.”
“We really think that Imperial stu-
dents will lap this up. To be honest,
with the current workload every-
body’s miserable as it is.”
“Imperial’s just been going through
the motions for god knows how many
years now. I mean, it’s autumn term,
spring term, summer term, exams,
and then the same all over again. It’s
just boring and predictable. After
about 100 years of the same old same
old, we think it’s high time that we
shake things up a bit .
In the quest to “get back to basics”, as
our source said, “we’re going to get rid
of all those gadgets and science things
you have around Imperial, spray-on
fabric and all that, it’s just not believ-
able.”
“To be honest, we’ll probably get rid
of lectures too and let students ﬁgure
their degree out for themselves. We
really want to invoke a harsh Victorian
atmosphere to ﬁt in with our South
Kensington surroundings – we just
hope it rains more!”
On top of this year’s rise in tuition
fees for home students, it is expected
that there will be an extra compulsory
charge for 3D glasses, “We really want
students to get the full College experi-
ence, and it’s time for us to get with
the program. After all, everybody
knows that you can’t see in three di-
mensions without 3D glasses – come
on, it’s in the name.”
Our source was particularly ex-
cited about plans for the Rector’s in-
volvement in the expectedly proﬁt-
able scheme, “We’re really envisaging
the Rector as a Batman-style ﬁgure,
head to toe in rubber and taking on
criminals with an ample budget. The
Queen’s Tower can be the Batcave.”
Bob Freundlich wades through misery
Probably has a beard, or at least the
pathetic pubic hair stragglings of one
that he tried to grow. Deﬁnitely won’t
shut up about Jack Kerouac, bought
a Fear & Loathing poster with him to
uni, orders drugs oﬀ the internet (as
he’s so alternative that he takes “ket”
and “MD” every night at a rave). Still
thinks counter-culture and drug tak-
ing is rebelling against the system,
un-ironically contributing to the
great ﬁnancial institution that is uni-
versity debt. Will probably drop out
following a plant-food based trip to
rehab.
People you'll meet at Imperial
who you probably shouldn't
be friends with

Think you’re
funny? Punk
Well, you very well may
be, and you’ve come to the
right place. We always want
contributions and new ad-
ditions to the little humour
team over here. How, you
scream at the page? Stop
shouting at paper, you look
weird. Not sure if we want
to talk to you anymore, but,
fine.
