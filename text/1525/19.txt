COMMENT
ake no mistake:
“The Innocence of
Muslims” is a vile
ﬁlm, and an insult
to the Founder of
Islam and Muslims the world over. Yet
the response to it across the Muslim
world has done far more to tarnish the
name of Islam than any short ﬁlm ever
could.
It is, for the unacquainted, the ama-
teur ﬁlm which slandered the Founder
of Islam in just about as many ways
that a 13 minute movie can slander an-
yone, and the spark which lit the tim-
ber of so-called ‘Muslim Rage’ around
the world. Global protests ensued,
aimed primarily at US embassies, with
much loss of life to both foreign and
national citizens. In Pakistan for ex-
ample, whose government announced
a National Holiday to protest, well
over 20 citizens have been killed –
most of whom were policemen trying
to contain the rioting. Such protests
do not represent the majority of the
peaceful demonstrations that were
held. In fact, as ever, the handful of
extremist Muslims that targeted em-
bassies and killed ambassadors in the
purported ‘defence of Islam’ do not
represent the vast majority of the 1.6
billion Muslims worldwide that con-
demn both the ﬁlm and the violence.
However it is this ﬁrebrand version
of Islam that usually meets the pub-
lic eye, and thus it is this extremism
that must be most publicly denounced
by ordinary Muslims more than any-
thing. Not doing so gives a full sense
of justiﬁcation to the original ﬁlm-
makers who can simply say that their
point has been proved.
Having said that, let’s not forget
what originally caused the chaos. It’s
easy to fall for the narrative that this
was simply the case of hypersensitive
Muslims searching for and ﬁnding
inﬂammatory material. But a deeper
look into the history of the video re-
veals that this was not the case. The
original ‘trailer’ was released back in
early July to absolutely zero eﬀect by
“Nakoula Basseley Nakoula,” a man
of extraordinarily low repute - be-
ing both a convicted fraudster and
an ex-pornography director. Many
disappointing weeks later, the Egyp-

FRIDAY 5 OCTOBER
... it is this
extremism
that must be
most publicly
denounced
by ordinary
Muslims ...
tian Christian anti-Islam activist
Morris Sadek decided to upload an
Arabic-dubbed version of the ﬁlm
to YouTube, disseminated the link to
journalists, and teamed up with the
well known US Pastor Terry Jones –
famous for his “Burn the Koran Day”
antics. Together, they publicised the
ﬁlm in conjunction with Jones’ rather
comically-named “International Judge
Muhammad Day” – which is held, of
course, on 9/11. It was only after such
concerted eﬀorts by these extremist
individuals to get the video seen by
their Muslim counterparts, that any-
thing actually kicked oﬀ.
There are many who are quick to cry
‘freedom of speech’ whenever such in-
ﬂammatory material is released. They,
however, should realise that it is a fal-
lacy to believe that speech is entirely
free, especially given the circumstanc-
es spelled out above. Hate-speech
and anti-defamation laws abound in
Western countries, and rightly so.
In America, free speech is restricted
when there is an intention or likeli-
hood to cause imminent violence or
law-breaking, and as such there is a
strong case for the creators and pro-
moters of this ﬁlm to fall under the
scope of such limitations. Those who
still support the right for such views
to be aired should at the very least
emphasise their condemnation of this
abuse of free speech, for the sake of
peace and cohesion in society. If one’s
loved ones were publicly slandered
with no basis in truth, recourse to the
‘free speech’ argument would perhaps
be a tad slower. And it’s important to
realise that for millions of Muslims
worldwide, the Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh) is more beloved to them than
anyone else.
Nevertheless, the actions which ex-
tremist mobs carried out in his name
bear no resemblance to the prac-
tice of the man himself. The Qur’an,
the holy book of Muslims, is replete
with instructions to forgive and for-
bear: ‘’And the servants of the Gra-
cious God are those who walk on the
earth in a digniﬁed manner, and when
the ignorant address them, they say,
‘Peace!’’ (25:64). Muslims believe that
the Prophet (pbuh) himself lived his
life entirely in accordance with the
Qur’an, which instructs him: “Keep to
forgiveness, and enjoin kindness, and
turn away from the ignorant.” (7:200).
Thus how can those who violently
protest say they are defending his
honour, when their actions so clearly
defy his practices?
Indeed the early history of Islam
recounts many instances of perse-
cution of the Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh), and yet on his eventual return
to Mecca, when he had full power
over his once-persecutors, he told
them that they were not going to be
punished for their previous crimes
– rather, that they were free. No ret-
ribution was exacted from the perse-
cutors of the Prophet (pbuh) himself
that day, yet the extremists have taken
the lives of many innocents in the so-
called ‘defence’ of his honour. Do they
not see that the Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh) was instructed to, “Repel evil
with that which is best. And lo,” the
Qur’an continues, “he between whom
and thyself was enmity will become
as though he were a warm friend.”
(41:35). Pertinent guidance indeed for
these troubled times – which Muslims
and non-Muslims alike would do well
to follow.
