Healthcare Trust keep records poorly
Record keeping problems at the Impe-
rial College Healthcare Trust — which
runs ﬁve London hospitals and is the
largest NHS Trust in England — have
led to long delays for critically ill pa-
tients. 900 patient records were found
to be incomplete while over 3500
people had to wait longer than the 18
week target for operations and many
more, including cancer patients, re-
ceived vital test results late.
In a statement the Trust said: “We
have carried out a thorough clinical
review of records of patients that were
referred to us for suspected cancer
where we had not recorded that the
patients had been seen and, where
appropriate, treated. To date we have
found no evidence that these patients
have come to clinical harm as a result
of our poor record keeping. 18 pa-
tients have been re-referred. All have
been seen, and none have been found
to have cancer.” While 74 of those af-
fected have since died statement from
the Trust said that “an independent
clinical review group has found that
there is no correlation between the
reason for death and this data report-
ing issue”.
Even though the problem came to
light in January eﬀorts to contact af-
fected patients through the GPs who
referred them to hospital were not
begun until May; a delay the Trust de-
fended as necessary to investigate the
full extent of the data loss. There has,
however, been widespread criticism
of the distress caused to vulnerable
patients. Katherine Murphy, Chief
Executive of the Patients Association,
said that the situation was “unaccep-
table for any patient who has had any
investigation, but especially patients
awaiting cancer results, where every
day counts”.
The issue was judged to be so seri-
ous that Westminster, Hammersmith
& Fulham and Kensington & Chelsea
councils sent a joint letter to Sir Rich-
ard Sykes, the Chair of the Imperial
College Healthcare, expressing their
“signiﬁcant misgivings about [the
Trust’s] management and govern-
ance”. The BBC recently reported an
external report published last month
as revealing that the problem had its
roots as far back as 2008. The report
blamed both “a serious management
failure” and “antiquated computer sys-

tems”. Seventeen diﬀerent IT systems
were found to have been used at the
hospital at the same time — creating
confusion and increasing the possibil-
ity for errors. The report concluded
that “the Trust lost management grip
of delivery of waiting time standards”
and that “until mid-2011, many man-
agers and staﬀ did not recognise the
importance of ensuring the basics are
done excellently”. The Trust has since

Mark Davies, Imperial Healthcare’s
chief executive, was reported as ad-
mitting that “both the poor standard
of record-keeping in the past and the
measures we have had to take to ad-
dress this may have resulted in con-
cern for patients and their families”.
He added that he wished to “apolo-
gise unequivocally for any distress
that might have been caused”. A Trust
spokesperson added: “ Our patients’
safety has been our absolute prior-
ity while we have addressed issues
in the way we record our data ... We
are extremely sorry that this situation
was not identiﬁed and resolved earlier
however, we would like to reassure
our patients that this was an issue of
poor record keeping not clinical care.”
