Dr Who’s underwhelming love Song
Maciej Matuszewski gives us his opinion on the newest Doctor
have previously expressed
my mixed views of Doctor
Who on these pages. I’ve
been a regular viewer since
the show’s revival in 2005 and
honestly I’ve found over the years that
the show’s episodes can be split into
three categories. A third are good and
entertaining in their own right, a third
disappoint me at how they squander
the show’s amazing premise, and
a third are so bad that they’re fun
to watch and laugh at.
I’m entertained two
thirds of the time
and so keep
watching
but un-
der no circumstances could I say that
the show has been consistently good.
I was therefore pleasantly surprised
to ﬁnd that I genuinely enjoyed all of
the ﬁrst ﬁve episodes of the new se-
ries. After much controversy about
the apparent overuse of long term sto-
ry arcs, all of the episodes so far this
series have been standalone. I had,
honestly, been indiﬀerent about
the issue. While the long term
Doctor Who storylines were
hardly masterworks, I found
some of the worst ep-
isodes, such as the abominable
‘The Curse of the Black Spot’, to be
standalones. The change in format,
however, seems to have worked in
the show’s favour.
While there have been some mis-
steps the episodes so far have all
had a wonderful feeling of fresh-
ness to them. Both the regulars
and the guest stars have been on
ﬁne form and the stories them-
selves have covered interesting, if
not entirely original, themes. There
was plenty to interest both the
younger viewers, such as the epon-
ymous creatures from ‘Dinosaurs
on a Spaceship’, and the older, such
as the discussion in ‘A Town Called
Mercy’ as to what sacriﬁces should
be made in the name of justice.
The emotional departure of regu-
lar companions Rory and Amy was
particularly well done, being at the
same time tragic and unexpected
as well as the culmination of a long
running plot strand of the two
gradually growing more distant
from the Doctor.
My biggest complaint about the
series would have to be the use of, or
rather lack of use of, River Song. In-
troduced years ago in ‘Silence in the
Library’ as a mysterious
stranger she was eventu-
ally revealed to be Rory
and Amy’s daughter
who, in the ﬁnal episode
of the previous series
married the Doctor.
Unlike many others I
don’t have any seri-
ous problems with
the character herself,
though her relation-
ship with the other
three main protago-
nists has been rather
disturbing at times,
but I believe that, given
how much the writers of
the show have made of
her, she really has been
underused. Despite be-
ing the Doctor’s wife she
wasn’t even mentioned
this series until her appear-
ance in episode ﬁve. There were
precious few scenes between her
and her parents, and none show-
ing any signiﬁcant emotional de-
velopment in the aftermath of
the many traumatic situations
they have faced together.
The audience has been left
guessing why the Doctor fell in
love with her after remain-
ing romantically aloof
for so many series and
her limited screen time
means that there simply
has been no time to show
her and the Doctor act-
ing as a couple. All this
makes her refusal to stay
in the TARDIS with the
Doctor for the ﬂimsiest
of non-reasons at the end
of the latest episode even
more frustrating. The writers
made a bold, if controversial,
move in having the Doctor get
married but unless they can de-
velop the Doctor and River’s rela-
tionship and show it having some
consequences on the story they
should just abandon this particu-
lar plotline.
Rant aside, this really is a good
start to the series. Episodes one
to ﬁve should still be on iP-
layer for a day or two af-
ter this review comes out
and you should certainly
catch the show when it
returns this Christmas after
the mid-season break.

A match made in heaven? Apparently not...
