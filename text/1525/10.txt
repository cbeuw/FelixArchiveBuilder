Tim Arbabzadah: What basic ad-
vice would you give to freshers in
halls?
Nigel Lewis: Don’t keep large amounts
of cash in your rooms, make sure your
bedroom door is closed behind you
and never allow someone to tailgate
you.
TA: How about the freshers not in
halls?
NL: If you intend to rent a property
and haven’t already done so, stay clear
of renting from the Gumtree web-
site, try to keep to an approved estate
agent. Remember – you get the keys
at the same time as paying your de-
posit – not at a later date.
TA: Given that laptops/iPads are so
easy to carry, and so common: what
can people do to make sure thieves
don’t take things?
NL: Any piece of electronic equip-
ment can be registered at www.Imo-
bilise.com – it is FREE!! If your items
are stolen there is a much higher
chance of getting them back if the
police can trace them to you. As you
move keep the information updated
on the Imobilise website.
Never leave your phone or laptop
unattended anywhere in the college -
particularly in the library. Not all the
people you see in the college are stu-
dents or staﬀ.
TA: When around campus, such as
in the library, what should people
do to keep possessions safe?
NL: Take them with you – never leave
them unattended.
TA: What is the most common way
that people lose and get stuﬀ sto-
len?
NL: Most theft in the college is due
to folks not realising that it is a public
place and that members of the public
are often wandering around it. Stu-
dents and staﬀ leave their property
unattended because they feel it is a
safe place to do so. Leaving your lap-
top and phone in an unlocked oﬃce is
like leaving it in Hyde Park or in a café.
TA: When on nights out, what
should everyone do to ensure no-
body is harmed?
NL: Always plan your journey home,
few people do this and can end up a
bit worse for drink and wandering
around. If the night changes, re-assess
your journey home. Try to stay with at
least one other person and if you are
travelling by bus, stay on the ground
ﬂoor – don’t go upstairs.
If someone oﬀers you a “Cab” or
“Taxi”, they are an illegal taxi tout.
NEVER USE THE SERVICES OF
AN ILLEGAL TAXI TOUT, you are
just getting in to a stranger’s car, they
can charge you what they like, would
not have insurance to carry you, and
could attack you.
TA: Living out is the ﬁrst diﬀer-
ence between ﬁrst and second year.
What should people avoid doing?
NL: Plan your journeys, ensure you
pick up your post as soon as you can
if it is left in a common area such as
the hallway. Keep your room or apart-
ment locked and never let a stranger
in through the front door of the prop-
erty. Don’t carry large sums of cash
around, keep it in the bank.
TA: Landlord problems are not too
uncommon. What should people do
to make sure they aren’t taken to
court and have a strong case if ever
in trouble?
NL: The Landlords and Tenants Act
is very precise about the way a ten-
ant and a landlord should conduct
business and behave. When you take
a property be sure to get a Shorthold
Tenancy Agreement from your land-
lord. This will normally be for a peri-
od of 6 or 12 months. Pay the rent on
time and keep the noise down.
The police can’t help with landlord
problems as it is a civil matter – but
I am very happy to oﬀer advice to
students experiencing landlord prob-
lems, and at times can speak with the
landlord to oﬀer advice. You can con-
tact me at Police@Imperial.ac.uk.
TA: Drugs are something that peo-
ple may encounter at university.
Obviously, your advice is going to
be to avoid drugs. For those who
are going to, what should they do to
make sure nobody gets hurt?
NL: When in a club and drinking
from a bottle, keep the bottle in your
sight at all times so it can’t be spiked.
The police would never advocate the
use of illegal drugs because we so of-
ten see the consequences of drug use
and the devastation it can cause.
Never share needles, if you have to
use drugs try not to drink alcohol at
the same time, the eﬀects can be dev-
astating.
The simple answer from me is al-
ways going to be: if you are arrested
for a drug oﬀence, your career may
well be over, as may be your time at
Imperial College. Keep a straight
head and if you feel that you are hav-
ing problems staying focused for your
studies – go and get help from the ex-
cellent counsellors at Imperial.
Nigel Lewis is the LGBT (Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) Liai-
son Oﬃcer for the police and runs an
LGBT surgery at Imperial College. He
is happy to speak to anyone regarding
hate crime and LGBT issues.
