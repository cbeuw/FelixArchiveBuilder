FRIDAY 5 OCTOBER
How to stop wasting time
Deepka Rana spends 3 hours pretending to write a byline
his week I met Dr. Mag-
dalena Bak-Maier, a
personal development
and learning expert,
executive coach to top
level scientists and entrepreneurs, and
author of Get Productive. The premise
of the book is simple: instead of feel-
ing overwhelmed by having too much
to do, you can learn how to use your
brain well and get things done with
time to spare. As she currently works
at Imperial as a Organisational Devel-
opement Consultant, it seemed ﬁtting
to ask the productivity expert a few
questions to help Imperial students
with their studying habits:
DR: Do you believe electronic
apps/tools aid productivity (such as
EverNote, Dropbox etc.) and why?
MBM: Some do and many don’t. A
good app helps you get things done
and saves you time. My favorites are:
Skype for one-to-one interviews and
face-to-face project work anytime,
Dropbox to carry and access key
documents, Goalscape for mapping
and tracking your goals, and Notes for
writing simple to-do lists and remind-
ers. I also really love Clock and use it
to work to time on tasks. It’s amazing
what the brain can do when you give it
a challenge.
DR: What is the most common
problem people have when it come
to productivity and how do you ad-
vise them?
MBM: The key problem is procras-
tination, as in delaying the work for
later. In the brain, procrastination is
actually a code for ‘get more info,’ but
few people have worked that out. So
instead, procrastination is used to ill
eﬀect. My advice is to learn how your
brain works and what processes run
eﬃciently in there and how come and
then to replicate that process. This is
what I do with people in my one-to-
one work: Look at things where you
don’t procrastinate and notice why.
Then compare to areas where you do
and get curious. For intelligent brains
the answers appear pretty quick. It’s
like engineering. There’s a problem
and there’s at least one creative way to
solve it. In my book I identiﬁed 13 so-
lutions, and all problems can be solved
using a combination of these strate-
gies, if not one strategy.
DR: Is there such a thing as being
too productive? Where should peo-
ple, students in particular, strike a
balance?
MBM: In the traditional sense of
productivity as in getting results, yes!
But I have redeﬁned productivity on
far more holistic terms. To be produc-
tive means to achieve results like may-
be top grades but also beinghealthy,
balanced, having fruitful relationships
with others, and keeping it all in per-
spective. Productivity of this nature
leads to long term stability and sus-
tained performance and will give you
a competitive edge in the job market.
DR: How can students better hone
their leadership and time manage-
ment skills on a day-to-day basis?
MBM: Use the 13 strategies I outline
in the book on a daily basis and hone
them like any other skill. Most likely,
you will ﬁnd that you’re already good
at some of them, some of the time. So
give yourself an extra edge by work-
ing that up in a way that matches your
needs and life. This is what makes Get
Productive so unique. Rather than be-
ing prescriptive, it is creative. It lets
you work the solutions however you
want so long as you focus on results.
DR: What is the most interesting
case you have come across in your
field as an author/consultant?
MBM: I once worked with an aca-
demic who arrived to my oﬃce feel-
ing overwhelmed and frazzled. We
worked together for 3 months and in
the end he found so much free time
he came back so that we could brain-
storm how he could use it! I regularly
work with leaders challenging them
to aim higher and do better but to
achieve this on healthy, fun terms.
And I model that in my own life. It’s
more fun that way.
