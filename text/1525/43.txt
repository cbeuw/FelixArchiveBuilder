An incident that can only be
described as “you shitting
your pants in public in the
middle of a lecture” occurs.
You squelch your way, de-
feated, to the toilet, and won-
der how on earth you can
claw back from this depth of
humiliation. You really can’t.
At least you have chocolate
mousse for lunch now!
This week, you write tbh in a
horoscope as you can’t fit the
whole version. LMFAO, WTF
is up with that shit. Anyway,
can’t really say that much is
going to go well for you this
week. You’ll go to Metric,
again. You’ll get rejected by
both the girls in there. Again.
You’ll be hungover and miss
your labs. Again.
This week, you start to make
some on point, topical refer-
ences to Gangnam Style.
HEY EVERYONE, HAVE YOU
SEEN THIS NEW THING
CALLED GANGMAN, NO,
WAIT, GANGNAM STYLE.
IT’S WELL FUNNY LOL.
You’re new friends disown
you. They never liked you
anyway, you’re a prick tbh.
This week you’re at The
Mingle, smoking a cigarette
in public. FUCK YOU MUM
YOU CAN’T STOP ME. You’re
mother stops you. That’s just
before I have sex with her. Oh
yeah, that’s right. You weep at
the horror of the fact that your
own parent had a more “ac-
tion packed” first week than
you did. Shame. Pint?
This week the Union, in its infi-
nite wisdom, decides to break a
Guinness World Record. Celeb-
rities descend upon Beit Quad
to witness the momentous oc-
casion. Unfortunately, a record
breaking mass book burning
probably isn’t the best choice.
Everybody leaves with a sour
taste in their mouths. Somebody
mutters, “What’s the Union?”
This week you’re sitting on
Queen’s Lawn, eating a wrap
from one of the College’s many
‘great value’ food and drink es-
tablishments, when a falcon
swoopsdown,tearingitfromyour
hands. Unable to handle a mo-
ment away from Imperial’s range
of food products, you break
down and go for dinner outside
campus. It’s actually decent.
Resigned to your never chang-
ing academic fate, this week
you fail to prepare for an up-
coming solid week of examina-
tions out of retaliation against a
system that strives to hold you
down. Imagine your surprise
when you ace them all, becom-
ing a hero among your peers.
You wake up in the exam hall.
Everybody shushes you.
This week you’re on an of-
ficial tour of the Library.
Separated from the rest of
the crowd you take a turn
down a dark, dank hallway.
Opening an ominous red
leather door you stumble
across a wide variety of
dogs playing poker. You
ask to join in, they politely
decline.
It turns out that urination for
the nation campaign your
dad told you about isn’t ac-
tually a thing. For legal rea-
sons, this horoscope can’t
contain any more informa-
tion, but what it can say is
–––––––––– public disorder
charge ––––––––––––– labs
––––––––––– pissing against
a lab bench ––––– you.
Thisweekyouwakeupstrapped
to a dentist’s chair. Seeing as
you haven’t got an appointment
booked the whole situation is
vaguely concerning. The dentist
asksyouhowyoursummerwas,
what options you’re taking, and
whatsocietiesyou’rejoining.You
struggletoanswerduetoexces-
sive mouth cramp. The drill is
activated...
This is the dawning of the
age of Aquarius. Unfortu-
nately you’re not invited to
the dawning ceremony and
so get 5 years bad luck. Sor-
ry. To start with, you have a
test tomorrow morning. Oh,
and a crippling need to go
to the toilet, but also a fear
of people hearing that plop
sound it makes.
This week you visit the gym,
with the sole intention of “go-
ing hard”. Sets of weights fall
before you, the treadmill be-
comes your best friend and
the swimming pool cowers
before your athletic prowess.
Or at least you think so, until
it turns out you’ve mistaken
the gym for the library, and
everything for books.
