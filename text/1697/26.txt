Felix recommends: top picks for a summer of culture
As the days grow longer, the cultural offerings in the capital tend to dry up, with people electing to head outdoors
rather than sit in the theatre. Rejoice, culture lovers – Felix is on hand with some of the top recommendations for
a summer of art and culture.

T
here’s a strange
paradox within
the London
cultural scene:
as soon as summer hits,
with the days growing
longer, and the evenings
stretching out before us to
the horizon, theatres and
galleries begin to close
shop, using the summer
months to prepare
their new seasons. It’s
unfortunate, since July
through to September is
the period when most of
us have more time to go
out and explore the city –
although, as student loans
begin to dry up, this lack
of shows and exhibitions
might be a blessing in
disguise. Never fear –
Felix are here, to give you
recommendations on all
the best cultural things to
do this summer, without
breaking the bank:
Globe Summer Sea-
son
Midsummer is when
Shakespeare’s Globe
really comes into its own.
With the top of the theatre
open to the elements, the
months through from
April to October are the
only time the Globe can
rely on weather clement
enough to run perfor-
mances. Even then, the
notoriously temperamen-
tal British climate means
you’ll always be taking a
bit of a risk when going
to see something. It’s all
part of the charm of going
to the Globe, which is a
quintessentially summery
London activity. As usual,
groundling tickets – for
standing in the yard – are
only £5 for most perfor-
mances, making the Globe
one of the most accessible
theatres in the UK.
This year’s season
has some classics from
Shakespeare’s repertoire
– Hamlet, Othello, Love’s
Labour’s Lost – but the
team are also putting
on a series of talks and
workshops exploring how
Shakespeare continues to
be relevant to the modern
day. Discussions, perfor-
mances, and events will
look at race within Shake-
speare, as well as the idea
of censorship in the world
of theatre. New work by
Morgan Lloyd Malcolm,
Jude Christian, and Matt
Hartley will also be
performed, while events
completely unrelated to
Shakespeare – such as the
Alternative Miss World
competition – will be held
in the famous venue.
The Globe’s Summer
Season runs through to to
October.
Serpentine Pavilion
The Serpentine
Pavilion, which pops up
for a few months in front
of the Hyde Park gallery,
has become a London
summer institution. As
Instagram and social
media have exploded,
the Pavilion has become,
more than ever, the place
to be seen to be. This
year, in its 18th
iteration,
the commission has gone
to Frida Escobedo, a
Mexican architect, who
will hopefully create a
space that feels more
intimate and reflective.
At 39, Escobedo is the
youngest architect to
create a pavilion, and
has drawn her inspiration
from a number of sources:
the pavilion itself will be
constructed out of cheap-
ly-produced Mexican
roof tiles, overlaid in
a lattice structure; one
courtyard within the space
is angled to line up with
the Greenwich Meridian,
meaning visitors will get
to experience a play of
light as it reflects off pools
of water and the ceiling,
changing subtly through-
out the day. El Lissitzky’s
‘Proun’ artworks, which
interrogate ideas of space
and perspective, have
also been a key reference
point, with Escobedo
hoping to create a “space
of discovering” within the
Pavilion.
While visiting the
pavilion, you can also
check out the exhibition
of Christo and Jean-
Claude’s massive sculp-
tural interventions within
the urban landscape –
previous projects included
wrapping the Reichstag in
fabric – on display in the
main gallery.
The Serpentine Pavil-
lion runs from 15th
June to
7th
October.

Young Vic – Fun Home
Cartoonist Alison
Bechdel may be most
famous for the cinematic
test that bears her name
– does a film have two
female characters, who
talk to each other about
something other than a
man? – but her graphic
novel Fun Home, released
in 2006, is one of the best
memoirs to come out in
the noughties. It tells the
story of Bechdel’s child-
hood in Pennsylvania,
and the tyrannical rule of
her father, a high school
English teacher and
funeral director. Bechdel
explores not only her own
burgeoning sexuality, but
also that of her father, who
was in the closet through-
out his life. Through a re-
cursive structure, Bechdel
traces the events leading
up to her father’s death,
filtered through a rich,
literary layer of allusion
and reference.
This summer sees the
musical version of the
graphic novel, which won
five Tony awards, includ-
ing Best Musical, coming
to London’s Young
Vic. When it opened in
Broadway in 2015, it
was critically-acclaimed,
with The New York Times
calling its score a ‘master-
piece’. It’s sure to be one
of the hottest tickets of the
summer, so make sure to
get in early for a chance to
see it.
Fun Home runs 18­th
June to 1st
September.
Tickets from £10.
Barbican – Dorothea
Lange/Vanessa Win-
ship Double Bill
The Barbican Gallery
follow on from their
sterling group photogra-
phy exhibition Unseen
Worlds, which looked at
those on the fringes of
society,withaphotograph-
ic double bill. Dorothea
Lange is best known for
her iconic photograph
Migrant Mother, which
came to be representative
of the Great Depression
in the USA, as well as
her work for the Farm
Security Administration
(FSA) documenting the
plight of sharecroppers.
She later went on to
cover the internment of
Japanese-Americans
during the Second World
War – a shameful chapter
of American history.
To both settings, Lange
brought her remarkable
humanistic eye, showing
the individuals behind the
mass tragedies.
Her work is paired with
Vanessa Winship, the crit-
ically-renowned British
portrait photographer,
whose black and white
photographs share the
same arresting empathy
as Lange’s work. Winner
of numerous awards,
she works primarily in
Eastern Europe, turning
her lens onto a range
of individuals as she
conveys the fragility of
both the landscape and the
individual.
National Theatre –
The Lehman Trilogy
Lehman Brothers is
a name that, instanta-
neously, conjures up
the ghost of the 2008
financial crash, whose
effects are still being felt
around the world today.
The images of the office
workers, carrying out
their cardboard boxes on
the morning of September
15th
, 2008, have become
iconic representations
of the modern era. This
summer, the National
Theatre takes on the
story of the bank, and
how it came to exist, in
their production of The
Lehman Trilogy, Stefano
Massini’s sprawling, epic
production. Coming in at
nearly four hours long,
and told in three parts over
the course of an evening,
Sam Mendes – director
of Skyfall and American
Beauty – will be responsi-
ble for ensuring it doesn’t
run away from us. He will
be directing a stellar cast,
including Simon Russell
Beale, while set designer
Es Devlin (The Nether,
Chimerica) is to bring a
grand sense of scale to the
production.
The Lehman Trilogy is
on at the National Theatre
4th
July to 22nd
September.
Tickets limited.
White Cube – Memory
Palace
London is absolutely
filled with independent
commercial galleries,
which often do individual
or group shows of some
of the most interesting
contemporary artists
working today. All too
often, however, people
avoid them, for fear
they’ll stick out like a sore
thumb. The White Cube
galleries have managed
to establish themselves as
a sort of halfway house
between the tucked away,
appointment-only com-
mercial galleries and the
major blockbuster venues
like the Tate or Royal
Academy.
This summer sees
them putting on one of
their largest group shows
in recent memory, split
between their two London
galleries in Bermondsey
and St. James’s. Memory
Palace promises to be
an exhibition that will
“inspire reflection on
the forms and themes
of memory.” It features
over forty artists, includ-
ing the who’s who of
contemporary art: Eddie
Peake, Antony Gormley,
Cerith Wyn Evans – the
list goes on. The exhi-
bition also promises to
be a highly-international
affair, with exhibited
artists ranging from Mona
Hatoum, whose evocative
installations challenge our
visions of the world, to He
Xiangyu,whoexploresthe
contradictions inherent in
modern industrial society.
Memory Palace is on at
the White Cube Bermond-
sey and Mason’s Yard 11th
July to 2nd
September.
Free admission
Tate Modern – Chris-
tian Marclay: The
Clock
Sometimes, the idea
for a work of art is so
brilliantly simplistic, you
wonder why it hasn’t been
thought of before. This
was surely the reaction
to Christian Marclay’s
installation piece The
Clock, which debuted
at the White Cube in
London back in 2010, and
returns to the UK for the
first time in seven years.
The Clock is a 24-hour
video, running on a loop,
in which Marclay has
compiled a wide range of
film and TV scenes fea-
turing clocks, timepieces,
or references to the time.
The film tells the correct
time – so if you visit it at
2.30pm, the scenes will
be showing clocks at that
exact minute. At once
simplistic and complex,
the piece took over three
years to create, and won
the Golden Lion at the
Venice Biennale when it
was exhibited.
Previous iterations
of The Clock have seen
lengthy queues, but – with
the Tate Modern showing
it through until January –
there will be a long time
for Londoners to catch it.
Within the shots, Marclay
builds up his own sense
of rhythm, grouping
similar shots together
to manipulate the audi-
ence’s emotions, creating
feelings of tension,
drama, and tenderness.
Once a month, the Tate
Modern will stay open all
night, giving cinephiles
and art-lovers alike the
chance to see the piece in
all its glory.
The Clock is on 14th
September 2018 to 20th­
January 2019. Admission
free.
