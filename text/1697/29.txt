Thomas Cole – Will we lose our Eden?
In the first UK exhibition dedicated to the great American landscape artist, Arts Writer Helen Money-Kyrle is
awestruck at the grandness Cole’s paintings and poignancy of environmental message.
B
orn in 1801
duringtheheight
of the Industrial
R e v o l u t i o n ,
Thomas Cole was to
become one of the great-
est landscape painters in
American history. Having
grown up in Lancashire,
England, he moved to
America with his family
at the age of seventeen,
determined to become a
painter. Still well-known
in America, he was highly
popular at the time, and
his awe-inspiring depic-
tions of the American
wilderness have continued
to influence succeeding
generations of artists and
the public alike.
Entering the exhibition,
I can see why his early
works were, and still are,
so admired. Dramatic and
romantic, Cole’s View
of the Round-Top in the
Catskill Mountain places
us on the top of a mountain
as we look on towards
another mountain, the
wild and untouched land-
scape stretching far into
the distance. Close to us,
a couple of windswept
and gnarly trees add to
the sense of depth of the
painting, making the
mountain and distant river
feel far away, as wispy
clouds make us realise
how high up we must
be. We are left in awe of
this huge mountain; a
formidable work of nature
that feels more permanent
than anything humans
could build.
Having established
himself as an artist in
America, Cole traveled
to England and Italy
(1829-1831), where he
saw much art which
inspired him and met with
a number of influential
artists, including JMW
Turner. Cole was a fan of
Turner’s early work, evi-
denced by his borrowing
of the dramatic clouds
in Turner’s Snow Storm
for his greatest work The
Course of Empire. Being
largely self-taught up to
this point, he studied fine
arts in Italy, and exper-
imented with new tech-
niques such as that of oil
sketches, which he took
with him back to America
and shared with other
artists, in what was to be
later dubbed the Hudson
River School movement.
“Entering the
exhibition, I
can see why
Cole’s early
works are still
so admired”
“Cole watched
the landscapes
he loved
tamed to
make way
for railroads,
factories, and
farmland”
As the exhibition trans-
ports us chronologically
through his life and work,
so too we see pieces by
those that inspired him. I
was particularly taken by
Hadleigh Castle by Con-
stable, which caught my
attention just as it caught
that of the young Cole.
The ruined castle is set in a
rugged, coastal landscape;
the dark colours used for
the scenery contrasting
with an almost obsessive
array of white highlights
across the entire scene,
giving the castle a
mystical, haunting feel.
The painting shows the
decline of what was once a
great manmade structure,
with nature reclaiming
the crumbling building for
itself. This rise and fall is
one that resonated with
Cole, forming a running
theme through much of
his work.
His greatest series, The
Course of an Empire,
depicts the rise and fall
of a civilisation, with
each scene set in the same
imaginary location with
its distinctive mountain
peak. As time passes we
see humans tame the land,
later building a grand
empire, before greed
causes the destruction of
the city in a cruel war.
Finally, we watch as
nature reclaims the land-
scape for herself, leaving
us with a last, peaceful
image of just civilisation’s
remnants left behind. With
probable influences from
an imperial London and
his visits to ancient ruins
in Italy, Cole’s series was
met with critical success
and is truly stunning.
most iconic paintings, The
Oxbow, contrasts the wil-
derness and farmed land,
whilst River in the Cat-
skills is thought to be the
first landscape painting
to depict a railroad.
Having spent much of
his career painting the
wild landscapes around
the Hudson River, Cole
opposed the destruction of
the American wilderness,
in particular rejecting the
government’s expansion-
ist plans under President
Andrew Jackson.
Sadly, though Cole’s
techniques and style
went on to inspire a next
generation of artists, his
response to society’s
responsibility to the envi-
ronment were largely lost.
Increasingly, artists cham-
pioned industrialisation
through their work, such
as in Durand’s Progress
(1853), commissioned
by a railroad executive.
However, given the recent
tumultuous changes made
to environmental policies
in America, there was
a poignant relevance to
his work that I had not
expected.
As I walked out onto
Trafalgar Square, I felt an
unexpected camaraderie
with Cole. He too visited
the National Gallery, when
it was just five years old,
and would have wandered
around the same rooms.
His appreciation for the
beauty of nature, and his
warnings of the cost of
unchecked environmental
policies on the natural
world have gained new
relevance as we become
increasingly aware of the
effects of climate change,
and our impact on the
planet. Popular then, and
popular now – his work
will continue to be appre-
ciated in years to come.
