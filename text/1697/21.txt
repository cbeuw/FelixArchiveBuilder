‘Toilet’
We conclude the Sex Survey with a look at where
people have been getting down and dirty on and
around campus. The Union Building was far and
away the most popular place for people to have sex,
with a number of individuals reporting bumping
uglies in Metric. At Felix we try and stay reasonably
sex-positive, but even we’ve gotta admit that’s nasty.
Blackett, Central Library, and City and Guilds
Building were all popular places for people to have
sex, with some individuals reporting getting it on in
the Library group study rooms. It’s a bit of a loose
interpretation of what‘group study’means.
The only non-South Kensington place recorded
was the Reynolds Building, which is located on
the Charing Cross campus. It was a surprisingly
unpopular venue, given students think medics are
the department who have the most sex.
This question also highlighted how vague some
people could be in answering their questions – a
vast number of people simply said they’d had sex
in‘toilet’or‘bathroom’, which others said they’d had
sex in ‘halls’. A note to those taking the survey next
year – be a bit more specific with where these places
are.
Oh, and to the person who had sex in the Felix
Office – please tell me you cleaned up afterwards…

That concludes the Sex Survey for another year!
We hope you’ve enjoyed reading, and look forward
to seeing you in 2019!
