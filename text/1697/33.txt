What you need to do before you leave Imperial
University is over before you know it, they say. I’m sure some students would disagree. Nevertheless, Alice Davage
and Fred Fyles are here with some things to make sure to do before gaining your freedom…

Watch a premiere
Ever noticed those
bright spotlights encir-
cling the night sky over
campus? No, they are
not signalling an alien
invasion. The police are
not scouring campus for
a wanted criminal either.
Although, both of these
things would certainly
liven up exam season.
They are in fact a sign that
a movie premiere or other
glamorous event is being
held at the Royal Albert
Hall! Take a break from
studying and immerse
yourself in a scene of
glitz and glamour. That
red carpet may be a pain
for those of you heading
to Beit – a whole two
minutes will be added
to your journey as you
walk around the damn
thing – but embrace the
opportunity to escape
from the often mundane
life of an Imperial student.
For the best view sneak
into the lecture theatres
facing Prince Consort
Road in the aeronautics
building. Alternatively,
befriend residents of Beit
Hall and use a bedroom
on the south or east sides
as a temporary viewing
platform. – AD
Avoid Exhibition
Road Mormons
We’ve all been there.
You’ve had a long day of
lectures, where you didn’t
understand a single thing,
and all you want to do is
head home to collapse
into bed. Then you see
two young men with
freshly pressed shirts,
megawatt grins, and side
partings so sharp they
could slice your fingers.
They make a beeline
towards you, but you
hurriedly dash across the
street, narrowly avoiding
the taxis streaming past.
You breathe a sigh of
relief, then see two young
women in floor-length
skirts wafting towards
you. It’s too late. You’re
trapped. And now you
need to awkward excuses
about why you don’t want
to go the church with
the strangely-muscular
Jesus opposite Imperial.
If you’ve not tried to get
through the Mormon
Gauntlet that is Exhibition
Road, have you even
attended Imperial? – FF
End a night at the
Slug
It’s incredible how
quickly plans for ‘a quiet
pint at the Union’ can
transform to an incredibly
messy night ending up
at The Slug @ Fulham,
West London’s premier
nightspot. Their Facebook
page says they “always
have an awesome time
so come on down and
enjoy it with us”. Luckily,
after half a dozen pints
from 568, everything
seems awesome, so
you’ll probably enjoy the
sweaty confines of the
Slug, until the inevitable
feelings of shame/nausea/
regret that accompany
the next morning. It may
have been described as
the “worst bar ever” on
TripAdvisor, but the Slug
holds a special place in
Imperial students’ hearts.
Make sure to visit before
you leave. – FF
Take part in a Felix
Centrefold
For a short amount
of time after arriving at
Imperial, I presumed
having a tasteful picture
of semi-naked students in
your university paper was
aprettynormalthing.They
said everything would
be different at university,
so I presumed this was
just one of those things
– like learning how to do
laundry, or crying in the
toilets 24-hours before a
deadline – that all students
get to experience. Reader,
I was wrong. It wasn’t
until speaking to friends
from other universities
that I realised how odd
the Centrefold actually
is. Forget curly fries or
crushing pressure – what
really makes Imperial
unique is the number of
times naked photos of
members of Cheese Soc
have been posted around
campus. – FF
Library all-nighter
The dreaded all-night-
er. You spent the first
two years of your degree
judging the crazy people
who live like hermits in
the 24/7 sweatbox we
call Central Library. Then
final year hits. Severe
procrastination and sheer
terror has left you with
two untouched lab reports
due the following day.You
enter the library hoping to
be leaving triumphantly
in a matter of hours. It
gets to midnight and you
still haven’t deciphered
your lab protocol, which
may as well be written
in ancient hieroglyphics.
It is at this point that you
realise it’s an all-nighter
or failure. You are one of
us now. – AD
Post-exam pints and
curly fries
Finishing your final
exams at Oxbridge might
involve being doused
in whipped cream and
Lambrini (if anyone ever
tried that shit with me I
swear I would cut them),
but at Imperial it’s a more
sedate affair. The most
common sound you’ll
hear after leaving your
last exam isn’t shrieks of
delight, but the question
‘Union?’ Heading to 568
for a few pints and orders
of curly fries, that Imperial
staple, is what most of us
will truly associate with
true freedom. Whether
of not that evening ends
with an early night or a
messy one (see above for
Slug-related information)
is up to the individual.
Regardless, Stella 4 has
never tasted sweeter. – FF
