T
he thing gamers
look forward
to more than
upcoming release
dates or the Steam summer
sales is E3 – the Electronic
Entertainment Expo. A
showcase of everything
to get hyped about and
enjoy for the future in
the world of gaming. So,
without further ado, here’s
our evaluation of the main
conferences of E3.
EA – Decent
Right off the bat, EA
made a course correction
in light of the whole loot
box fiasco from last year,
which saw a wave of
international criticism
accusing them of encour-
aging gambling. They ac-
knowledged their mistake,
and promised to try and
work better on it from
now on. At least some
people have learnt their
lessons. They when on to
showcase Unravel 2 and
Anthem, which were both
really impressive, and
talked about their future
plans with upcoming Star
Wars games: additions
to the current Battlefront
2 and a new game in the
future. However, they kept
mum about Battlefield 5’s
economy, which, despite
their assurances of saying
they understood the
problem with loot boxes,
seemed a bit disingenu-
ous. Highlights – Unravel
2, Battlefield 5, Anthem
Bethesda – Good
Fallout 76 was front
and centre at Bethesda’s
conference; they went all
out and provided lots of
details, which was a blast
to hear about. Fallout 76
would be the first online
game in the Fallout series,
with a map four times as
large as that from the
previous version, and the
ability to launch nuclear
missiles to boot. You
can also own and wear
your own Fallout helmet.
Apart from this, they also
showcased other games
like Wolfenstein, a Doom
sequel, and Elder Scrolls
VI, all with release dates
and ample information.
Highlights – Fallout 76,
Elder Scrolls VI, Wolfen-
stein
“Microsoft’s
conference
was where all
the good stuff
was, making a
change from
last year”
Microsoft – Great
Ah, now this is where
the good stuff was. Mi-
crosoft’s conference was a
complete change from last
year’s more disappointing
blowout. Maybe it was
due to the Xbox One’s
lacklustre performance
but the tactic they went
for was to focus on a wide
variety of games. And
boy did they deliver: all
games were shown with
trailers, release dates, and
a fair bit of inside infor-
mation about the games
themselves. A number of
Square Enix games were
also showcased which
was a nice treat. They
also talked about their
plans for the future, with
a cloud gaming service,
and about all the studios
they’ve bought, and plan
to buy. A really well done
performance by Microsoft
all around, impressing us
with their tenacity and
honesty. Highlights –
Forza Horizon 4, Devil
May Cry 5, Jump Force,
Ori and the Will of the
Wisps
Square Enix – Poor
Man, talk about so
much hype followed by so
much disappoint. Many
interesting things were
expected here, from a new
rumoured Avengers game
to the next Final Fantasy
game fans were eagerly
waiting for. Instead, all
we got were two short
teasers for The Quiet Man
and Babylon’s Fall, which
barely highlighted any
gameplay or release dates.
Square Enix basically shot
themselves in the foot by
giving a good majority
of their upcoming stuff
to Microsoft, meaning
there was very little they
could show themselves.
It was them at their most
complacent, and they
really need to bring their
A game next time round.
Highlights – Just Cause
4, Shadow of the Tomb
Raider, Kingdom Hearts 3
Ubisoft – Really Good
Long story short,
Ubisoft’s conference
was solid and enjoyable
– there’s not a whole lot
of bad things you can
say about it. A number of
games were highlighted
where ship battles seem
to be the new schtick for
the future, and Beyond
Good and Evil 2 provided
breathtaking visuals in
just a trailer. Star Fox
joining the Switch version
of Starlink was a nice
surprise and a good payoff
of Ubisoft’s relationship
with Nintendo. Highlights
– Beyond Good and Evil 2,
Assassin’s Creed Odyssey,
Skull and Bones
Nintendo – Really
Good
Lastyear,thesewerethe
guys who knocked it out
of the park in E3. Whether
you think the same is true
this year depends on how
much you like Smash. The
reason being that Ninten-
do’s main focus was Super
Smash Bros. Ultimate for
the Switch. There were a
lot of reveals, and much
to like, such as all the
characters from previous
versions, some new ones,
and touched up aesthetics.
Apart from Smash, more
games were highlighted
to maintain momentum
with the Switch like a
new Fire Emblem and
Fortnite! Sadly other
franchises like Pokémon
and Animal Crossing were
barely touched upon and
it seems the 3DS is all but
forgotten now. Highlights
– Super Smash Bros.
Ultimate, Fire Emblem:
Three Houses, Super
Mario Party
Sony – OK
This is the second
year in a row where
Sony has failed to make
a huge impact at E3. The
main focus was on four
games which are hugely
anticipated by fans, but
were known about well in
advance. It was essentially
a compact hour of trailers
and gameplay footage. It
was nice, but truthfully
only Ghost of Tsushima
needed such a boost, as
little had been shown of
the game beforehand. In
a strange move, Sony
actually revealed several
other games, but only
to those watching the
live stream of the event.
With the last year being
incredibly successful for
Sony, it’s possible they
didn’t feel they needed
to give much and were
probably saving their
energy for (rumour has it)
a Playstation 5 down the
line. Highlights – Death
Stranding, The Last of
Us Part II, Spider-Man,
Ghost of Tsushima
Forza 4 and The Last of Us Part II were two games that made a big impression at E3 // Microsoft/Sony
