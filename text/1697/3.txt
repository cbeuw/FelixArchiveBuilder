SCR remove cooked
breakfast as campus
services are cut
At the end of July last
year, the Senior Common
Room served their last
cooked breakfast to
students and staff, as
they made wide-ranging
changes to campus servic-
es. As well as removing
the cooked breakfast
option, they increased
prices across all outlets,
reviewed portion sizes,
and reduced opening
hours of food outlets.
The changes, which
were made by Campus
Services, a branch of
the College, were made
“where reinvestment can
demonstrably be made
to the wider benefit of
the community, against a
minimal impact on staff
and students.”
The changes, which
students and staff were
not consulted on, left a
number very upset. One
academic told Felix the
changes were “outra-
geous”, while another
said “it sounds like [when
the College talk about]
‘reducing their cost’, it’s
really coming out of our
pocket.”
Around three months
after the changes came
into effect, Imperial
College Union launched
a survey, asking staff and
students about campus
services and opening
hours. The Union has not
reported on the results of
the survey. – FF
Strikes hit Imperial
amid pension dispute
More than 60 univer-
sities were disrupted by
strikes as staff protested
against proposed changes
to their pensions which
could have seen lecturers
lose up to 60% of their
final pension pot. Fourteen
days of escalating strike
action took place over
four weeks earlier this
year. A further fourteen
days of strikes planned to
disrupt end-of-year exams
were narrowly averted
as the University and
College Union, represent-
ing teaching and support
staff, agreed to a deal
which will maintain the
current pension scheme
until at least April 2019.
Students have been told
exams will not include
content missed as a result
of the strikes. A class
action lawsuit has been
launched by legal firm
Assersons on behalf of
students seeking a refund
of their tuition fees. The
case involves more than
5,000 students, who could
receive several hundred
pounds each.
Last week, Felix
revealed Imperial has so
far withheld just under
£280,000 from staff
involved in the strike.
Unlike other universi-
ties, Imperial has not
ring-fenced this money
for student support and
services.
Universities, including
Imperial, supported the
switch to a defined con-
tribution scheme (where
pension value is linked to
the stock market), claim-
ing the current University
Superannuation Scheme
had a £7.5 billion deficit
and was “not likely to be
sustainable”. – JW
Union criticised over
handling of sexual as-
sault case
In first term, Felix
reported on the case of an
alumna, Helen, who had
been sexually assaulted
by a current student when
returning to Imperial for
an event. The assault took
place on Union property.
After reporting the case
to the Union, the Union
and College took seven
months to reach a conclu-
sion, during which time
the accused had become
president of a Union
society.
During the investiga-
tion, Helen was passed
between a number of
staff members, and was
repeatedly asked to
provide statements about
what happened during
the evening of the assault.
She also went for periods
of up to six weeks without
any contact from the
Union or College.
and recommended having
the perpetrator attend a
consent workshop, as
well as banning him from
licensed Union premises.
They did not recommend
removing him as society
president. – FF
Pay falling in real
terms for Imperial
staff
Wages are decreasing
in real-terms for most
Imperial staff while large
sums are being spent on
the salaries of senior staff
and the College’s property
portfolio.
Below-inflation pay
rises have left staff facing
average salary decreases
of 1.1% each year since
2005, according to a pay
claim published by the
Joint Higher Education
Trade Union. Despite this,
College expenditure on
wages increased by just
over 3% in 2016/17 due to
“an exceptional increase
in very highly paid staff”.
At the same time, the
unions criticised Impe-
rial’s increasing capital
expenditure. Referring
to the £1.42 billion spent
on property investments
since 2011, the joint
unions said: “Clearly, the
February saw strikes hit over 60 universities // Joseph O'Connell-Danes

the Union's

her sexual
assault left
her suicidal at
times”

devote its surplus to build-
ings rather than to staff.”
On top of this, a de-
manding work culture
means Imperial staff work
beyond government-set
time limits and provide
the equivalent of two days
per week without pay.
The joint trade unions
have set out a series of
demands, including a
7.5% pay rise for staff. –

Imperial revealed to
have large invest-
ments in tobacco and
fossil fuels
An investigation by
Felix into the endowment
fund of Imperial revealed
the College had signifi-
cant direct and indirect in-
vestments in the tobacco,
fossil fuel, and weapons
industries.
In total, as of Septem-
ber 2017, the College was
investing £3.5 million
in the tobacco industry
of collaborating with the
Nigerian government in
the torture and execution
of activists, as well as
crimes against humanity.
Imperial also had
£650,000 in Philip
Morris, £400,000 in
Imperial Brands, and
over £370,000 indirectly
invested in Reynolds
American, some of the
largest tobacco companies
in the world. These invest-
ments were made through
investment funds, some
of which the College had
been investing in since
at least 2013. Imperial
currently has 29 research
groups working on cancer
prevention, detection, and
treatment.
Rhidian Thomas, Impe-
rialCollegeUnion’sEthics
and Environment Officer,
told Felix: “I’d like to
congratulate Imperial on
succeeding in bringing
together a comprehensive
selection of some of the
most ethically dubious
companies around, all
in one portfolio. It’s
staggering that anyone in
College thinks it appro-
priate for a university – a
charity even – to give so
much money to the arms
and extraction industries.
Even College’s commit-
ment to avoid investing in
tobacco seems paper-thin,
now that it’s clear that it
has millions invested in it
through third-party funds;
so much for ‘smoke-free
Imperial’.” – FF
Debates continue
over high pay and ex-
penses among senior
management
While the majority of
Imperial employees are
experiencing real-term
pay cuts, senior staff are
collectively pocketing
more than their counter-
parts at any other Russell
Group university.
In 2017, the College
spent £5.6 million on the
salaries of 20 ‘key man-
agement personnel’. This
translates to an average
pay packet of £280,000
each – an 8% rise on the
previous year’s figures.
410 members of staff are
paid more than £100,000.
Imperial president
Alice Gast has the second
highest salary of Russell
Group vice-chancellors
and is paid £433,000
(beaten only by the Uni-
versity of Birmingham’s
David Eastwood, who
takes home £439,000).
On top of her salary,
Professor Gast claimed
nearly £44,000 in ex-
penses – more than the
median Imperial salary.
The figure is also sub-
stantially greater than the
average Russell Group
vice-chancellor expenses
claim, which is under
£10,000. The majority of
Professor Gast’s claims
were for international
travel, with the remainder
split between taxis, gifts,
and hospitality. – JW
Counselling Service
struggling with in-
creased demand
As exam season kicked
in, Felix revealed the huge
pressures the College
Counselling Service is
being put under. The
number of students regis-
tering for counselling has
increased by over 80%
since 2012/13, while the
sessions on offer have
been unable to keep up.
The result is a waiting
time which now stands at
seven weeks on average,
with some students re-
porting waiting up to 15
weeks.
The Counselling
Service currently employs
about seven full time
equivalents to serve a
student body of 18,000.
Rosie Summerhayes,
head of the Counselling
Service, told Felix their
budget had been frozen for
the past two years, despite
the College making nearly
£120 million in surplus
last year.
The increased wait
times have had a knock-
on impact on student-fac-
ing staff members, who
are now having to spend
more time than they
usually would speaking to
students who are finding
things difficult. Profes-
sor Simone Buitendijk,
Vice-Provost (Education),
told Felix: “Our invest-
ment in student coun-
selling will be increased
significantly in the next
financial year.” – FF
Teaching Excellence
Framework under-
goes significant
changes
The Teaching Excel-
lence and Student Out-
comes Framework (TEF)
has undergone significant
changes in its third year
(not least its rebranding).
Imperial still holds a
Gold award but this is
not directly comparable
to the ratings issued in
this year’s iteration of the
TEF.
Three new metrics
have been introduced
alongside the original
student satisfaction (from
National Student Survey
data), number of students
completing their course
(rather than the number
of students dropping out),
and graduate outcomes six
months after leaving uni-
versity. These now form
an “initial hypothesis”
which assessors modify
by considering supple-
mentary metrics as part
of a “holistic judgment”.
To further complicate
matters, a flag system has
been introduced. The TEF
is now simultaneously so
complicated that assessors
without a background in
advanced data handling
require extra training,
yet “simple and easy for
students to understand”.
Trials are also under-
way for subject-level
ratings, which are
designed to account for
varying quality within
universities. Documents
released by the Depart-
ment for Education state
subject-level TEF awards
will provide students
with “more granular and
informative information”.
While these changes
help to allay some con-
cerns raised by critics
over the years, there are
still worries that the TEF
will be used to increase
tuition fees.
Lastyearprimeminister
Theresa May announced
fees would be frozen at
current levels until 2019,
putting the kibosh on plans
for gold and silver-rated
universities to be able to
increase tuition fees in
line with inflation. Since
then, education secretary
Damian Hinds has sug-
gested universities charge
different fees to reflect
each subject’s value to
society. Subject-level TEF
awards may well facilitate
this. – JW

was revealed
to have
£3.5 million
indirectly
invested
in tobacco,
through funds
used since at
least 2013”
– indirectly, through
investment portfolios
– nearly £9 million in
the fossil fuel industry,
and £3.1 million in the
arms industry. A number
Imperial tumbled down the ethical league tables, with Felix revealing missions of
pounds invested in the fossil fuel industry // Tom Mrazek
Helen, who has a
severe, long-term mental
health condition, requir-
ing her to go to hospital
each week for treatment,
was left feeling suicidal
at times: “I was consumed
with the case,” she told
Felix, “while nobody
responsible for it seemed
to care, or even acknowl-
edge it. This made me feel
my grip on reality was
slipping.”
When the Union
reached their final deci-
sion, they concluded “on
balance of probabilities”
Helen’s account was true,
of these investments
were direct investments,
including £1.5 million in
Royal Dutch Shell, the 7th
largest producer of oil and
gas worldwide, who had
previously been accused
