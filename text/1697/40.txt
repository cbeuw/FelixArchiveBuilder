U
ltimate Frisbee,
also known by
cool kids as
just ‘Ultimate’,
is a relatively new sport,
having only been devel-
oped in the late 1960s by
a few students in New
Jersey. Since its inception,
the sport has exploded in
popularity; from fling-
ing cookie tin lids in a
play-ground to being rec-
ognized by International
Olympic Committee in
less than 60 years! With
that in mind, I got in
contact with Imperial’s
very own club, the disc
Doctors (dD), to find out
what the hype was about.
I arrived a little early
and gradually met the
team as they trickled in,
gathering around a tree
close to the old Hyde Park
football fields. It was late
February, and a stiff cold
breeze blew, but it didn’t
seem to affect the others,
who were bright eyed and
bushy tailed. There was a
very friendly atmosphere,
with teammates feeling
comfortable in one-an-
other’s presence; what I
sensed was a team that
were close-knit and at
the tail end of the season.
Although I was a newbie I
felt very much welcomed
and I was not treated as an
outsider.
Warm ups consisted
of throwing the frisbee a
moderate distance to one
another, while a veteran
player took me under
his wing to show me the
ropes. I must admit that
going into the session I
assumed that I would be
good at throwing, being
of moderate arm strength
and possessing enough co-
ordination for most sports.
What I forgot to factor in
is that those sports used
balls not frisbees, and I
slowly realized that with
frisbees there must be
a more delicate touch.
Instead of a ball that is
propelled and hindered
by the air, a well-thrown
frisbee glides on it. The
trajectory of the frisbee is
very sensitive to release,
wrist action, and angle
than any ball. Once you
see an Ultimate veteran
throw a frisbee you
acquire a respect for the
skill needed; it’s nothing
like how you throw them
on a warm summer’s day
at the beach.
During the warm ups I
“It’s nothing
like how you
throw a frisbee
on a warm
summer’s day
at the beach”
“The X factor
of Ultimate
is the ethos
attached to
the sport – the
spirit of the
game”
was taught the two most
basic throws: backhand
and forehand throws.
Backhand is the one you –
the reader – are probably
most familiar with: it’s
like back hand slapping
the air with the frisbee,
whilst the forehand is like
slicing precisely, with a
lot of flick of the wrist,
as you throw. I was also
taught what I’d like to call
the crocodile technique
for catching the frisbee.
Once thrown to me I
slapped my hands over the
frisbee sandwiching it like
the jaws of a crocodile
(there must be an actual
name for that technique).
Feeling more confident
and with more players
arriving we moved onto a
drill.
The drill consisted of
a few passes and then
a long pass down field
to someone who was
running. With my newly
acquired confidence the
initial passes were alright,
but on the longer pass I
messed up. Then the next
time I messed up again,
and again, and again. The
captain noticed what I
was doing, having played
American football for
such a long time I was not
throwing the frisbee level,
and when throwing a high
powered long pass; as a
result, the slightest failure
in technique was ampli-
fied. I tried to correct the
long pass technique, but
to no avail; with more
practice I think I eventual-
ly would’ve got it.
For the final part of
the session we played
a match. Instead of the
usual seven-a-side which
is standard, we played
five-a-side due to lack
of players. It is at that
point I came to grips with
the basics of the sport.
Ultimate feels to me like
an amalgamation of many
sports. The aim of the
game is to get someone
to catch the frisbee in
the end zone, which has
similarities to American
Football. You can’t run
when you’re in possession
of the frisbee and you
must throw it within a
specific time frame – that’s
like netball. I say it’s an
amalgamation, but it’s got
a little extra and feels a lot
different when actually
playing it. Yes, it involves
the oddly shaped frisbee,
but that isn’t the X factor.
What I would consider
the X factor is the ethos
attached to the game. This
may seem outlandish but
through my time with
the club there seemed to
be a nurturing of what is
coined the ‘spirit of the
game’. In Ultimate there
are no external referees
– it is self-officiating,
with that a silent pledge
to respect each other,
adhere to the rules, and
to play fundamentally for
the joy of the game. There
weren’t any sour feelings
The club is doing very
well, with a tour at the be-
ginning of each academic
year; different tiers; 1st
,
2nd
, and 3rd
teams; indoor
and outdoor teams; mixed,
men and ladies teams; and
a social scene too. They
compete on a national
stage, with many of the
players playing outside
of the club in the best
non-University teams in
the UK. Training sessions
are usually Wednesdays
and Saturdays, with
games on Sundays. In the
first term, players can get
a true taste of Ultimate,
with tournaments catered
for beginners. Further
into the season the club
competes in national
competitions and the club
have done very well in the
past. If you are interested

when someone scored,
only appreciation. I was
coached on the field too,
and my teammates tried
to put me in a position to
score to ensure I enjoyed
my time. There was an
understanding to enjoy
the game, with healthy
competition too.
