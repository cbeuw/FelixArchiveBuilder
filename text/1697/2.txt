A
lecturer at Car-
diff University
who fell to
his death had
been struggling with an
increasing workload, an
inquest heard last week.
Dr Malcolm Anderson,
who was a lecturer in
accounting at Cardiff
University’s Business
School, as well as a
personal tutor, fell to his
death on the morning of
the 19th
February 2018.
Coroner Andrew Barkley
later recorded a verdict of
suicide.
In a statement for the
inquest into the death,
his colleague Louis
Vallis said Dr Anderson
UCU calls on withheld salaries to fund bursaries
make withheld salaries
available to students
who faced a cut in their
student bursaries.
In an email sent to
Louise Lindsay, Director
of Human Resources and
Organisational Change,
earlier this week, Imperial
College UCU said they
had requested “on many
occasions” that money
deducted from the salaries
of staff taking part in this
year’s industrial action
go towards the Student
Hardship Fund.
They went on to say
they were told by College
earlier this month this
would not be possible and/
or difficult to administer.
Last week the College
told Felix withheld sal-
aries had “been retained
by the relevant academic
departments to support
their efforts to mitigate
the impact of strikes.”
Imperial College
UCU said this response
was “an unacceptable
justification,” and called
for the money to be made
available to students from
the 2015/16 intake who
had lost out on provision
of bursaries.
Dr Michael McGarvey,
President of Imperial
College UCU, said the
proposal “made it clear
to the management that
we strongly believe that
this money should only
be used for the direct
benefit of students and not
retained by departments.”
An analysis carried out
by members of Imperial
College Union last year
found students starting
in 2015 from qualifying
middle-income brackets
would receive substan-
tially less bursary, as
the College shifted to
a new system. Union
Council voted in favour
of a motion to lobby the
College to make addition-
al funding available to
affected students.
The Imperial Bursary
provides support to Home
undergraduate students
with an annual household
income of up to £60,000,
on a sliding scale. It is
available to students
throughout their degree –
not including repeat years
– and may be revised each
year.
Universities across the
country have withheld
salaries from academic
and support staff who
took part in the UCU
strike earlier this year.
The industrial action was
organised in response to
proposed changes to pen-
sions, which UCU argued
would leave members
£10,000 worse off each
year.
Last week Felix re-
vealed Russell Group uni-
versities have withheld £8
million in salaries, with
further deductions ex-
pected in the near future.
Imperial have withheld
just under £280,000 from
staff in March and April,
with the number likely to
increase in the future. A
number of other univer-
sities have ring-fenced
the withheld money for
student support services.
was struggling to create
timetables for university
within his allocated time-
frame, and would often
do it in his own time. Mr
Vallis said Dr Anderson
had “complained to
management a number
of times about the allo-
cation,” but “received the
same response year after
year.”
Mr Vallis also said Dr
Anderson had been asked
to mark 418 examination
papers over a 20-day
period.
According to Wale-
sOnline, Dr Anderson
left behind a note saying
his workload had finally
gotten to him. Police
sources said there were
emails on Dr Anderson’s
work computer referring
to “work expectations not
being manageable.”
Dr Anderson’s wife,
Diane, with whom he had
three daughters, described
her husband as someone
who “would always give
the very best to everything
that he did, but was
silently struggling.” She
said his commute was an
120-mile round trip, and
his workload meant he
was unable to spend time
with family.
Cardiff University, who
described Dr Anderson as
“an excellent teacher with
the rare ability to enthuse
the large numbers of
students who attended his
lectures,” said they would
be reviewing the support
available to staff.
The news led a number
of academics to refer to the
case of Stefan Grimm, a
professor of toxicology at
Imperial College London
who took his own life
in 2014. A posthumous
email sent by Professor
Grimm to staff within Im-
perial cited the pressure
he was under to bring in
more grant money, with
an email from his line
manager saying he was
“struggling to fulfil the
metrics of a Professorial
post at Imperial College”,
since he was unable to
bring in £200,000 per
annum in a programme
grant.
The coroner into
Professor Grimm’s case
described the death as
“needless.”
Imperial completed
an internal review of
staff policies following
Professor Grimm’s
death, although a College
spokesperson told Felix
at the time that “given the
complex nature of suicide,
it would be impossible
to answer with certainty
whether any action taken
by the College could have
resulted in a different
outcome.”
The case comes amid
increasing concern
over the workload of
academic and support
staff in higher education
institutions. Two studies,
released earlier this
year, highlighted what
Times Higher Education
described as “a crisis of
overwork and poor mental
health in academia.” In
one study, postgraduate
students were found to
be more than six times
more likely to experience
anxiety or depression than
the general population.

This is the end…
S
o here we are:
the final issue.
It’s been a week
of lasts: last time
asking section editors
how many pages they’ll
need; getting the last tube
home after working late
on the Sex Survey; and
now this, my last ever
editorial. Serving as Felix
Editor over the past year
has been an incredible
privilege. To say I’ve
enjoyed every minute of
it would be untrue, but
it has included moments
that have been so reward-
ing they outweigh any
minor inconveniences or
frustrations.
To be coming to the
end of this journey is bit-
tersweet. But – in classic
Felix style – this sense of
melancholy is tempered
by a mood of urgency and
slight madness. You may
notice that this week’s
Felix is slightly heavier
than usual – given it was
the last week, section
editors and contributors
pulled out all the stops,
delivering to you a
64-page behemoth of an
issue, the longest issue
we’ve put out all year. We
sincerely hope you enjoy
it, and have enjoyed the
previous 28 issues we’ve
put out since September.
Felix has been many
things to me during my
time here at Imperial. I
think, like most students,
in all honesty, my intro-
duction to university life
was difficult. Moving
into student halls where
you don’t know anyone;
becoming used to a class
size of over 200; suddenly
feeling like a very small
minnow in an enormous
ocean – they all took
some getting used to.
During the first couple
of years, it was writing
for Felix that gave me
some sense of regularity
– writing mainly for the
Arts section, I would take
a break from lectures, and
head out to exhibitions all
over this beautiful city.
Felix gave me an escape.
It wasn’t until my
third year that I actually
got involved with the
editorial team, joining
as an Arts Editor. It
was a hugely exciting
time for me – I can still
remember meeting with
the then-Editor Philippa
for the first time, as she
tried to put the freshers’
issue together without
a working office. I also
recall meeting with my
fellow Arts Editor, Kamil,
before term started, to talk
about all our plans for the
year; we went to the Tate
Britain’s exhibition of the
late works of JMWTurner,
and I promptly had a nose-
bleed – perhaps from the
sheer intensity of Turner’s
colours. Over that year
Kamil and I would build
up relationships with
London galleries and
theatres, pumping out an
insane amount of content.
It’s a time I remember
incredibly fondly, and
the Arts section still
holds a special place
in my heart. The Felix
Office became a refuge
for me – I would look
forward each Wednesday
to spending my after-
noons there, chatting with
other editors, and putting
together pages. Felix gave
me a home.
I went into this year
thinking I was prepared
for anything that could
be thrown at me. With
five years of experience,
I thought I had a good
grip on what the job
would entail. But I soon
came to realise that, no
matter how much time I’d
spent with Felix, nothing
could have prepared me
for the weekly rush to
get the paper out. What
completely blindsided
me, however, wasn’t the
work or the writing: it was
the people. We started
the year with very few
people remaining, and
rapidly had to rebuild
the editorial team. It was
an experiment – I didn’t
know whether or not
everything would work
out. But it did. The new
friendships I have made
this year, and the previous
ones that have deepened,
have been the most
valuable part of the whole
experience. I know, now,
that after the last issue has
gone to print, and I have
left this university, what I
will remember most isn’t
the articles we published,
or the change we helped
enact, but the people I
have met, and the expe-
riences we have all had
together. Words cannot
express how grateful I
am to everyone who has
contributed to creating the
paper this year. Felix has,
now, given me a family.
