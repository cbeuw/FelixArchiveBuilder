Jennifer Tseng brings a freshness to well-worn tropes
in this engaging debut
Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness benefits from a lyrical writing style, and a twist on the near-exhausted story
of forbidden love.
M
ayumi and
the Sea of
Happiness,
the new
novel from Jennifer
Tseng, follows Mayumi, a
forty-one-year-old librar-
ian, married with a child,
who begins an affair
with an unnamed seven-
teen-year-old boy who
she meets in the library.
Despite being aware of the
potential consequences
of her decision, Mayumi
cannot ignore this en-
counter, and her obsession
with the boy grows. She
asks him to meet her at the
waterfall, a secluded area
in the woods, and their
affair begins. She asks
him several times if he
would like to change his
mind, offering him – and
herself – an exit, but he is
adamant.
Tseng’s writing is
poetic, using the sym-
bolism of the island the
two inhabit to describe
Mayumi’s feelings
towardsherlover.Mayumi
does not shy away from
deconstructing this rela-
tionship in her endeavours
to come to terms with
this incomprehensible
attraction; is it his youth,
her stagnant marriage, or
the boy himself?
“Tseng’s
writing is
poetic, using
the symbolism
of the island
the two inhabit
to describe
Mayumi’s
feelings”
“The novel
takes on
unexplored
territories
in the well-
known plot
of forbidden
love”
From the very begin-
ning of their acquaint-
ance, one gets a Freudian
sense to this relationship:
Mayumi feels proud of
his legible handwriting
as he fills the registration
form for his library card
like a mother would for
her child. “And why
did I, even then, feel a
twinge of pride at that?”
Painfully conscious of
the “power differential”
in their relationship, with
her being older and more
experienced meaning
she often makes the first
move, Mayumi offers him
many chances to leave
before it is too late. As
the relationship develops,
however, it seems the
roles are shifting and he
is acting paternal towards
her; as he helps her climb
up to the loft, he in control
while she is looking up to
him for instructions like a
child. “I looked up at him
the way children glance
at their parents before
undertaking some new
challenge, and, without
missing a beat, he winked
at me fatherlike.”
The novel is broken
down into four main
parts, following the four
seasons. The affair begins
in the winter, with the
long nights offering some
refuge to their secret. As
the start of summer grows
nearer, however, Mayumi
is anxious about what the
future holds; he will soon
graduate and start thinking
of a life beyond the small
island. He has his whole
life ahead of him, and she
knows she can’t hold him
back. In fact, she is excited
to witness his journey of
growth even if it means
she is not a part of it. In
that sense, her maternal
instincts overpower her
selfish desires as a lover.
the well-known plot of
forbidden love. Mayumi’s
friendship with the boy’s
mother added another
dimension to the story.
His mother clearly plays a
dominant role in his life,
and through their interac-
tions, Mayumi can glean
more about him than he
is willing to share. On the
other hand, Mayumi is
tormented by her guilt of
“corrupting” the woman’s
son, while maintaining a
convincing façade when
in her company.
Mayumi never once
mentions her lover’s
name; the reason for this
is gleaned towards the
final pages. In that respect,
it is similar to Daphne du
Maurier’s Rebecca, in
which the protagonist is
never named: if a charac-
ter’s most basic form of
identity is not known, it
makes the reader question
their very existence. At
times, the implications
of the parental nature of
the relationship were too
heavy-handed; the novel
would have benefited
from a more subtle por-
trayal of the evolution of
the relationship and hence
the role of the ‘parent’,
trusting in the reader’s
ability to make these
connections on their own.
Nevertheless, Tseng’s
lyrical writing style,
interesting take, and twist
on a nearly-exhausted plot
in this debut novel already
has me waiting impatient-
ly for her next work.
