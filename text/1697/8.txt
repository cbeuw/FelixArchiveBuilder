Why we struggle to live up to our ideals
A
recent study
from Dr. Shai
Davidai and
P r o f e s s o r
Thomas Gilovich at
Cornell University shows
our prominent regrets
arise from ‘the ideal road
not taken’ – our inability
to fulfil our ideal-self
aspirations. Additionally,
results from six studies
indicate 76% of people
report not meeting their
personally-imposed goals
as the biggest regret in
their lives.
The theory at the core
of this research relies on
the idea that a person’s
sense of self depends on
three attributes: the ideal
self (their life aspirations),
actual self (attributes that
they possess), and ought
self (who their obligations
indicate they should be).
The following example
could be used to frame
this theory: a scientist
aspires to become a
successful academic
(ideal self), considers
themselves hardwork-
ing (actual self) and is
expected to be productive
by their peers, colleagues
and public (ought self). It
is not difficult to imagine
how not being able to
personally call themselves
a ‘successful academic’
would constitute a regret
more damaging than not
being called ‘productive’
enough by others – since
they are their own biggest
critic.
The researchers
proposed an explanation
that has to do with our
own set goals and re-
sources needed to achieve
them, rather than our sub-
jective experience of self.
Being “hardworking” or
“productive” involves
clear targets – a number
of intense working hours
daily, and a certain output.
Poorly defined guidelines
for achieving ideal-self
aspirations, meanwhile
– such as being a “suc-
cessful scientist”, a “good
mentor”, or a “good
parent” – pose harm for
individuals, and implicitly
for the society, since what
it means to have one of
these attributes is, at large,
a subject to debate.
A connection worth
further investigation is
between regrets con-
cerning the ideal-self
and impostor syndrome,
a condition that makes
people doubt their
accomplishments and
consequently feel as if
they were a fraud. While
research on impostor
syndrome is limited,
recently individuals have
taken to social media to
voice to raise awareness
about it – which has the
potential to trigger in-
creased scientific interest.
A recent study pub-
lished in the International
Journal of Medical
Education found around
a quarter of male and half
of female US medical
students suffer from
imposter syndrome, es-
pecially towards the end
of medical school. The
researchers highlighted
one possible reason for
such emotions would be
feelings of anxiety about
their ability to practice as
a doctor upon graduation.
Another possible
explanation, in light of
the Cornell University
research findings, may be
a discrepancy between
our ought self and actual
self, or the ideal self and
actual self. Thus, an in-
teresting research avenue
would be to compare and
contrast the ought self and
the ideal self, as well as to
investigate what happens
in situations when the line
is blurred between what
one wishes for oneself and
what others expect.
Researchintobehaviour
has the power to teach us
a basic understanding of
what being human entails,
and, importantly, what we
can do to improve society.
By using this knowledge
of what generates feelings
of regret, we can improve
communication about
what people want to bring
to the table, allowing
them to build a thriving
community at work,
home, or outside.
Drop in cancer risk five years after quitting smoking
A
new analysis of
the Framingham
Heart Study,
conducted by
a team of researchers led
by Hilary Tindle MD,
MPH at the Vanderbilt
University Medical
Centre, has revealed
encouraging findings for
both current and former
smokers.
Findings from the
Study – which is support-
ed by the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute,
and examined the health
records of nearly 9,000
people monitored over
a number of decades –
revealed individuals who
stop smoking had within
five years a 39.1% lower
lung cancer risk relative
to current smokers. The
rate at which the risk
of lung cancer reduces
is faster than has been
previously reported, and
highlights the benefits of
smoking cessation. This
risk continues to fall as
the years since quitting in-
creases, relative to current
smokers.
“If you smoke, now
is a great time to quit,”
said Professor Tindle,
the William Anderson
Spickard Jr., MD Pro-
fessor of Medicine at the
Vanderbilt University
School of Medicine, and
Director of the Vanderbilt
Center for Tobacco, Ad-
diction and Lifestyle. Prof.
Tindle further stated: “the
fact that lung cancer risk
drops relatively quickly
after quitting smoking,
compared to continuing
smoking, gives new moti-
vation.”
Nevertheless, it is
worth stressing the risk
of lung cancer remains
elevated despite quitting
relative to individuals
who have never smoked.
Co-researcher Matthew
Freiberg, MD, MSc said:
“While the importance of
smoking cessation cannot
be overstated, former
heavy smokers need
to realise that the risk
of lung cancer remains
elevated for decades after
they smoke their last cig-
arette, underscoring the
importance of lung cancer
screening”.
Biotechnological ad-
vancements have allowed
for the use of effective
tools such as lung cancer
screening, which signifi-
cantly contribute to a re-
duction in the risk of death
caused by lung cancer. Its
benefits, however, can be
maximised considerably
when partnered with suc-
cessful quitting.
Currently, smoking
causes 1.69 million deaths
worldwide each year from
lung cancer, and 87%
of lung cancer deaths in
the United States alone.
Needless to say, it very
much remains a public
health matter with and
action needed from gov-
ernmental, private, and
educational entities.

The dawning of the age of synthetic biology
Synthetic biology is one of the latest buzzwords in the STEM community, but what is it actually all about?

W
ould you
like to have
a vegan
hamburger?
Are you concerned with
the deteriorating environ-
ment? Are you a biology
geek eager to explain why
biology is cool? The
answer to such wide-rang-
ing questions is synthetic
biology.
What is synthetic
biology? Formally, it
is the interdisciplinary
science of integrating
engineering principles
to biology to actively
reimagine, reshape, and
re-engineer living organ-
isms and develop artificial
biological systems.
In more simple words,
it is changing perspectives
about harnessing the po-
tential of biology for prac-
tical use, borrowing from
the field of engineering to
bring more rigor, stand-
ards, and benchmarks in
communication to the
fundamental principles of
biology.
Philosophy of science,
more than anything else,
is driving the field of
synthetic biology. It aims
to correct longstanding
deficits obstructing the
progress of biology,
namely that it is ‘hard to
replicate’ and ‘hard to
predict’. The idea is to
bridge this fundamental
limitation in biology by
complementing it with
tools and principles of
engineering which have
developed over a few cen-
turies to be able accurate-
ly predict and replicate
results.
There are a number
of enabling technologies
which have made syn-
thetic biology possible as
well as different from its
predecessors. These tech-
nologies include automat-
ed DNA sequencing, rapid
DNA synthesis, efficient
DNA assembly, stochastic

modeling of biological
processes, and rigorous
statistical inference.
of synthetic biology have
been employed by its
predecessors, but only
partially. What makes
this new prodigal child of
biotechnology different is
that it provides a unique
interface, encompassing
all the enabling technolo-
gies together to focus on a
coherent purpose.
Synthetic biology has
done more than just allow
for scientific progress: it
has succeeded in bringing
together people from
diverse backgrounds like
biologists, engineers,
mathematicians, computer
scientists, policymakers,
environmental activists,
entrepreneurs, and inves-
tors. This has brought a
cascading effect resulting
into democratizing of
biotechnology. Many
‘Do it Yourself Biology’
labs have started to crop
up across the world,
including London, where
science enthusiasts are de-
veloping ‘radioshack-like
laboratories’ taking on
open problems. DIY
biology enthusiasts have
a more sophisticated term
for it: ‘Bio-Hackerspace’.
The name is inspired by
a hacking culture which
began in silicon valley in
the early 1980s where the
enthusiasts would tinker
with technology just to
push its limits.
The growing hacker
movement has raised
concerns among public
and policymakers alike.
Given even field-tested
GMOs are viewed with
suspicion, the idea of an
amateur trying to modify
bacteria to make it glow in
dark instead of a flashlight
is unpalatable to many.
These concerns have been
acknowledged by many
experts in the first ‘Syn-
thetic Biology 1.0’confer-
ence held at MIT, which
discussed the risk, ethics,
and intellectual property
issues associated with this
new paradigm of biologi-
cal engineering. However,
this conference coincided
with another event at MIT
which has become the
world’s largest movement
spearheading synthetic
biology: International
Genetic Engineering
Machines competition or
iGEM.
iGEM is hosted every
year at MIT where
teams across the world
participate and present
their project, built around
synthetic biology to
tackle any open problem
in biology. iGEM is im-
mensely popular, with the
number of participating
teams increasing every
year. The first iteration
of iGEM in 2004 saw
only five teams, but as of
2017 more than 300 teams
participated in this global
competition.
Perhaps the biggest
driver of iGEM’s popu-
larity is its emphasis on
science communication:
teams have to build an
extensive wiki to present
their work with proper
documentation of project
idea, workflow, results,
and a lab notebook for
all future teams to take
guidance from. Moreover,
every team has to do
public outreach, which
involves organizing work-
shops and media outreach,
conducting surveys, and
promoting themselves
on social media. The
track record of Imperial
College has been very
impressive in iGEM; the
team won the grand prize
in 2016 and came overall
second in 2014, 2011 and
2006. In a disruptive field
with no formal curriculum
iGEM has been a success-
ful endeavor in providing
young students with a
holistic education about
synthetic biology.
The UK has been very
proactive about being an
integral participant in the
emerging global synthetic
biology scene, where the
US has been the predom-
inant player. In 2012, the
UK Research Council
unveiled a roadmap for
future with the ambition of
making the UK a leader in
synthetic biology. Its key
recommendation included
investing in a network of
multidisciplinary centers
for synthetic biology and
fostering a skilled and
well-funded UK-wide
synthetic biology commu-
nity.
These recommenda-
tions led to forming of a
multi-university initiative
bringing together top five
UK universities in syn-
thetic biology – Imperial,
Cambridge, Edinburgh,
King’s, and Newcastle –
to “provide critical mass
and bring synergy” in
synthetic biology devel-
opment. While King’s
focuses on the social and
ethical implications of
synthetic biology, the
other four specialise in
advanced research.
Synthetic biology is not
just an evolution of a new
area of research but also a
societal and technological
movement strong enough
to revolutionize how we
as humans interact with
each other and our envi-
ronment. There is hope
as well as concern over
the change that might
come, but all we can do is
prepare for the changes.
The dawn of synthetic
biology is here.
Synthetic biology is bringing together lots of different teams // CC
Some ardent critics
of synthetic biology
complain the enabling
technologies of synthetic
biology have been around
for many years, and the
new field is no more
than a rebranded form of
genetic engineering which
provides no additional
utility beyond marketing
to investors and funding
agencies. To their credit,
they are partially right.
