In preparation for the summer break, Felix Travel continues on the topic of short trips in Europe you simply can’t
miss. Read on to find out why you should visit the tourist-beloved Italian gems Verona and Venice.
I
taly is a perfect choice
for your summer
vacation since it has
everything – from
big famous cities to quiet
lesser-known villages and
beach towns. You can pop
in for a quick weekend
getaway or spend a few
weeks touring all around
the country, whatever
floats your boat. It’s also
easy to score affordable
flight tickets (although
mostly during the off
season), and the warm
Mediterranean climate
will not disappoint. Last
year, I went on a three-day
trip to Verona and Venice,
two of the most popular
Italian cities loved by
couples and solo travellers
alike, and rightly so.
Scusi, we’re going to Italy: a trip to Verona & Venice
Verona
Most of us know
Verona as the hometown
of Romeo and Juliet,
protagonists of the tragic
love story by Shake-
speare. Naturally, one of
the main attractions there
is Juliet’s balcony at the
Casa di Giulietta (Juliet’s
house). You can pay to
go up there but you can
also admire it from the
outside at no cost. The
nearby souvenir shop sells
love padlocks, and there’s
a wall you can leave a
message on. There’s also
Romeo’s house, but it’s
simply private property
with nothing touristy.
For €5 you can climb
up the Torre dei Lamberti,
a tower that overlooks the
whole city, unravelling a
sea of cute red-roof houses
surrounded by mountains.
It truly looks spectacular
and is worth the heavy

climb! If you want to see
the panorama for free, you
can opt for climbing a hill
instead.
Another famous at-
traction is Castelvecchio,
a medieval castle (now
museum), and a bridge of
the same name. They both
offer amazing views of
the Adige River, with the
city and mountains in the
distance. There’s also a
coliseum in the city – not
as majestic as the one in
Rome but still very beau-
tiful.
Overall, less than a day
was enough to see the
main objects in the city so
I set off to Venice in the
late afternoon and visited
Padua on the way. This
city has several beautiful
churches and cathedrals
but since I arrived quite
late, I just had a lovely
walk around and treated
myself to some Italian
food.
Venice
Let me start this off by
saying that Venice is really
expensive so if you’re
not keen on spending too
much, you should plan
your visit well. The city
centre with all the canals
and tourist attractions
is in the island that you
can easily reach by bus
or train from mainland
Venice, where accommo-
dation is much cheaper.
The restaurant prices are
obviously very high, and
the service charge is man-
datory everywhere but
there’s a McDonald’s and
a couple of grocery stores
on the island. Public bath-
rooms are all paid, except
one cheeky loo at the top
of a supermarket near
the Rialto Bridge. This
supermarket also has a
free viewpoint if you want
to see the mesmerising
panorama of the city.
OK, now on to the
exciting part! The best
way to experience Venice
is to wander around on its
narrow streets, without
any plan really, and see
where it takes you. You
can easily take a random
turn that will instantly
lead you away from the

and is worth

Flying First Class: is it worth the hype?

B
ack in 2016,
when the rest
of my family
were on holiday
in Hong Kong (where I
refused to go as I needed
to revise for my January
exams), my mother said
I needed to take some
rest by taking some time
off as I was working too
hard. So I decided to
book a last minute flight
with Thai Airways to join
them there. However,
there were no seats left
anywhere except for First
Class because it was the
Christmas Holidays, and
so I had no choice – and
that’s how this trip
happened.
On-Ground Experience
When I got off my car
at Bangkok Airport, there
was a porter who came to
take care of my luggage.
We proceeded to walk
to the check-in counter
which looked like the
ones you see in hotels.
After that, I met a lady
who escorted me to the
fast track, which included
security and immigration
checks. I spent less than
five minutes there which
is considered unbelieva-
bly quick.
Then I visited the Royal
Orchid Spa, available
exclusively to First and
Business Class passen-
gers, where I got a com-
plimentary back massage
for one hour. After I got
refreshed at the Spa, I
headed to the First Class
lounge. There I found a
dining area, where I sat
down and ordered from
the a-la-carte menu, just
like in restaurants (except
that it was free here). Later
I went to the bar, which
had a wide selection of
drinks, and ordered my
favourite “fruit punch”.
The lounge was certainly
an excellent place to relax,
and the only thing I didn’t
like was the lack of inter-
national newspapers, such
as Wall Street Journal or
the Financial Times.
On Board Experience
Before boarding my
plane, I met another
member of the airline’s
staff who escorted me to
the gate and helped me to
carry my hand luggage. I
then found my way to my
seat, located on the upper
deck. It was a typical
modern first class seat,
equipped with a large
entertainment screen: you
can find this kind of design
on most inter-continental
airlines. A glass of Dom-
Pérignon champagne was
served prior to take off,
and after the flight had
departed, I went to check
out the lavatory – it was
much larger than the ones
in Economy or Business
Class. There was also a
built-in powder table for
packed touristy places to
a quiet living area. There
are many dead-ends but
it’s practically impossi-
ble to get lost. You can
also follow the canals,
the Venetian version of
streets – there are no cars,
just private boats, public
ferries (water-buses), and
gondolas roaming the
waters. Just be prepared to
encounter huge crowds of
people, especially if you
travel in summer.
While exploring, don’t
forget to visit the main
attractions too – the Rialto
Bridge and St Mark’s
Basilica. The entry to the
Basilica is free but the
queues are long, and be
prepared to pay if you
want to visit its museum,
ladies located inside.
Before the breakfast
service commenced, I
had received a menu with
about four choices of main
course. However, it was
also possible to have pre-
booked the meal before
but it was too late for me.
My breakfast consisted of
three parts: assorted fruit,
cereal, and “lobster rice
porridge” which I chose
for the main, and unfor-
tunately it tasted awful.
After the meal service
had finished, I reclined
my seat to the fully-flat
position and took about
an hour-long nap. It was
a comfortable journey,
partly because the weather
on the way to Hong Kong
was very nice. We arrived
to our destination slightly
earlier than expected.
Again, with the advan-
tages of the First Class,
it only took me about 15
minutes to get from the
plane door to the taxi.
So overall, was it worth
flying First Class with
Thai Airways for under
three hours? I would say
no, especially if you’re
not using any mileage
redemption to reduce the
highcost(itcostmearound
THB 36700 or £860 for an
online-discounted return
ticket between Bangkok
and Hong Kong). The
meal quality was the major
drawback, and the airline
needs to put more effort in
this matter. On the other
hand, their ground service
was remarkable and is
probably what attracts
most flyers.

treasury, or the Bell
Tower.
Gondola rides officially
cost €80 for 40min but
it’s for the whole boat
that fits six people, so
you can split the cost. The
gondoliers might raise the
price though – you can
try to bargain. You can
also purchase tour tickets
online and find the best
value-for-money option.
Otherwise, you can get
a 24-hour public transport
pass for €20, including
unlimited water bus and
land bus trips (land buses
in the mainland). You can
use water busses (not to
be confused with expen-
sive water taxis used for
personal hire) to visit the
neighbouring islands, like
Murano, famous for its
glass-making industry,
where you can attend a
glass-making demonstra-
tion.
Situated a bit further
out, Burano Island is
full of brightly-coloured
houses that together with
blue canals and colourful
boats create a picturesque
view. Get those Instagram
filters ready! Finally, you
can visit the beach in Lido
Island. These boat rides
let you savour the views
of the blue sea all around
but they are quite long
(60 minutes or more) so
maybe don’t risk it if you
have a flight to catch.
