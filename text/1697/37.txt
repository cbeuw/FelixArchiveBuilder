returning to the Union

I
mperial College
Health Centre
(ICHC) are report-
ing record numbers
of students being diag-
nosed with ‘Stockholm
Syndrome’ following
the summer examination
period.
In an email from ICHC
sent to College manage-
ment, which was leaked to
Hangman, ICHC staff cite
their “extreme concern”
at the number of students
experiencing “atypical
post traumatic stress dis-
order symptoms, similar
to those seen in patients
experiencing ‘Stockholm
Syndrome’.”
The letter then goes on
to detail the behaviour of
concern, which includes:
an inability to stay away
from Central Library,
despite having finished
all their exams; students
coming in to campus the
week after their vivas to
wander around and stare
into space; and numerous
students ordering cheese-
burgers and curly fries
from 568, despite the fact
that’s all they survived off
during revision season.
Hangman spoke to
Dr Elizabeth Bennett, a
psychiatrist specialising
in extreme stress, about
the students’ behaviour:
“what we’re seeing at
Imperial isn’t a new thing.
happens in periods of
extreme stress, or situa-
tions where the individual
literally thinks they could
die any minute.”
A number of students
who were reporting
similar symptoms spoke
to Hangman about their
experiences. Johnny
Pritchard, a final-year
physics student, was
sitting in Beit Quad when
we spoke to him about his
post-exam experience:
“well, I’d just finished my
last exam, and couldn’t
wait to get out of here
forever. We had a pretty
wild weekend, but then
when Monday rolled
round I found myself
getting up at 7.30 and
heading straight to Central
Library. I didn’t realise
what I was doing until I’d
been studying quantum
theory for two hours, but
even then I felt I couldn’t
leave campus.”
Another student, who
spoke to Hangman on
the condition of ano-
nymity, spoke about how
her life had unravelled
after handing in her final
project: “it’s strange – I
thought once I’d had
my hand-in I’d feel a lot
better about everything,
but I’ve become so used
to feeling like a piece of
shit who doesn’t know
anything and is constantly
under immense pressure.
The day after I was sitting
at home, but felt this
compulsion to come back
onto campus and spend 72
hours without showering.
It’s become all I know.”
Hangman spoke to
Owen Yarmouth, Vice
Provost (Rehabilitation
Services), who is respon-
sible for ensuring students
Students have been unable to cope without Central Library // Twitter/Imperial
are able to adjust to a
regular life post-exams:
“At the College, we
realise it can be difficult
for some students to rejoin
normal society. That’s
why so many just end up
going straight into a PhD
– it’s a route that utilizes
their ability to withstand
extreme pressure every
hour of every day. For
those who don’t want
to go into academia, the
Counselling Service has
set up a specialist pro-
gramme, aimed at helping
students develop coping
mechanisms for a life
without huge amounts of
stress. We are delighted to
say we’ve expanded our
Counselling Service to
address the demand. We
expect to work our way
through this cohort by the
end of 2020.”
“Students
were found
wandering
around
campus
aimlessly post-
exams”
There have been a number
of cases within psychiat-
ric literature which show
victims of emotional and
physical abuse bonding
with their captors, even
going so far as to develop
complete dependence on
them. It typically only

The tournament had
to be called off after
Materials students
set fire to the Physics
u n d e r g r a d u a t e
common room.

A
‘Best Boi
Tournament’
organised by
M e m e p e r i a l
has led to riots on cam-
pus, after arguments
over cheating escalated.
The tournament,
which aimed to establish
‘the greatest course at
Imperial’, had to be shut
down earlier this week,
after a contest between
Physics and Materials led
to an outbreak of extreme
violence and campaigns
of voter intimidation.
Hangman believes the
dispute originally began
when students from the
Department of Physics
were accused of using of
automatic bots to increase
their vote count. Physics
students then retaliated
with verbal attacks in
the Facebook comment
thread below the poll,
which soon spilled over
into real-life violence,
with fights breaking out
all over campus. Earlier
this week, the College de-
clared a state of emergen-
cy, as Materials students
set fire to the Physics
undergraduate common
room. No students were
hurt, although the micro-
waves did not survive the
blaze.
Speaking to Hangman,
Larry Paget, an academic
representative for the De-
partment of Physics, said
things had gotten “out of
hand”: “At the end of the
day, this is just a stupid
online competition, which
doesn’t really matter.
Memeperial should really
just call it in Physics’
favour – who even knows
what Materials students
do anyway?!”
Oscar Gilmore, under-
graduate representative
for the Department of Ma-
terials, disputed Paget’s
claim. “What do we do?”
he told Hangman, “What
don’t we do!? Physics
are just jealous they’re
stuck in dusty labs all
day. Everything the light
touches is ours.”
Hangman spoke to
William Raycock, Vice
Provost (Riot Prediction),
who said the disturbances
were “not unexpected”.
“Every year some-
thing along these lines
happens,” he told
Hangman, “as students
work out all their pent-up
aggression post-exams.
I was here to remember
the Great Library Cafe
Debacle of 2012, so these
small pockets of violence
aren’t going to worry me.
We just need to wait until
they tire themselves out
and fuck off back home
for the summer.”

This week your post-
exam high is punctured
when you get your
preliminary final project
mark back. You spend the
next two hours trying to
work out whether it’s still
possible for you to scrape
a 2:2.
This week you’re
responsible for analysing
the results of the Sex
Survey. You’re so
traumatised you’re unable
to look anyone on campus
in the eyes again.
This week you can’t
believe Trump says
Trudeau stabbed them in
the back, and yet remains
completely silent about
the Fusion price rise.
SAD!
This week you’re the
cover photographer, and
your enquiries into how
to get on top of a tall
building at Imperial lead
to an emergency meeting
with your personal tutor.
This week you book your
train ticket home for the
summer. Can’t wait to
completely regress into
a small child for the next
three months!
This week you get
hammered at the Union
Bar and put all your
student loan into Bitcoin.
What could possibly go
wrong?!
This week you’re
disappointed your
answers in the Sex
Survey were discounted
for being ‘so tragic it’s
clearly a joke’.
This week you find
yourself with so much
time post-exams. You
could learn a language!
Or take a pottery course!
You start an Instagram
page photoshopping
Trump’s head onto
babies’ bodies instead.
This week you and
approximately 5,000
other Imperial students
take advantage of the nice
weather and pile onto
the patch of grass in Beit
Quad. Seriously, just go
to Hyde Park.
This week you read the
Met Office has predicted
super hot temperatures
this summer. Perfect
for staying inside and
avoiding everyone you
know!
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer,
and you’ve resorted to
pulling the same jokes
about cryptocurrency and
exams. It’s been a long
fucking year.
