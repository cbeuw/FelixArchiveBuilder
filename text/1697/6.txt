Now is the time to
think about exactly why
your data are so valuable
and what privacy these
companies really can
afford you. In particular,
consider what data are
collected about you and
where they are stored.
What information is col-
lected by your FitBit? Do
you trust the government
of a country in whose
elections you cannot vote
to have power over sensi-
tive information about you
– say, about your sexual
orientation? This is where
GDPR comes in. Under
GDPR, you are granted
several important rights.
GDPR gives you the right
to object to your personal
data being processed for
marketing purposes. Fur-
thermore, it allows you
to obtain access to these
personal data and to have
them erased when they are
no longer needed. GDPR
also gives some further
rights and imposes heavy
penalties on organiza-
tions for not complying
or if their user’s data is
breached (see left).
provide a free service, and
therefore people have no
option but to accept the
status quo to continue to
use the Internet. How can
we know when you toggle
a button on a website
your choice is taken into
account? Do you know
in what form information
about you is stored?
Furthermore, many
apps and websites
continue to collect sensi-
tive information even if
the most stringent privacy
settings are enabled.
Many advertisers claim to
offer the option to opt-out
of personalized advertis-
ing, but they make it as
difficult as possible to do
this. There are exceptions.
MakeUseOf, for instance
has a very clear interface
which lets you toggle off
the collection of data.
However, most users
who are sufficiently con-
cerned use an adblocker
which denies revenue
to the website. They do
so because it physically
prevents the transmission
of sensitive information
so it gives them peace of
mind. As it stands today,
the World Wide Web
is designed so copious
amounts of sensitive
information are collected
in a manner not possible
two decades ago. We have
not had time to get an
intuition for what risks we
are taking when we use
the World Wide Web.
As long as personal in-
formation is collected and
stored in form to which
a single organization has
physical access , there is
always a risk that it will
be abused, whether that be
due to hacking, interfer-
ence from the government
of the country where the
infrastructure is located,
or for the sake of making
a profit.
As Francis Bacon
said, knowledge is
power. Information is
knowledge. Knowledge
about how people behave
gives power to influence
future behaviour. Today
the power of information
collected by websites and
apps is largely used to
influence our shopping
habits through advertis-
ing. However, this power
could be used to engineer
society to various political
ends. Legislation such
as GDPR is like a soft
measure against someone
with access to data and
a lack of moral compass
crossing the Rubicon and
turning the data against
the users’ best interests.
We should consider
whether we need to
redesign the World Wide
Web to make it physically
impossible for the data to
be compromised.
be to make a change in
business model so as not
to rely on personalized
advertising, which would
resolve the conflict in
interests between the
user and data holder.
Large-scale voluntary
collaborations such as
Mozilla, Wikimedia, and
the open-source instant
messaging app Telegram
demonstrate these are
scalable and sustainable
solutions. Alternatively,
users could pay a monthly
subscription fee for access
to services like apps or
websites, which would
then be divided among the
websites based on their
usage. This idea already
has immense traction – it
is precisely what Spotify
does for music and Netflix
does for film.
Finally, new decentral-
ized systems are currently
being developed by
the likes of MaidSAFE
and InterPlanetary
File System (IPFS) in
which users contribute
computing resources to
the network (like Bit
Torrent) and are rewarded
using a blockchain-based
currency. Such systems
would reward the content
creators (i.e. the users)
and those who contribute
data storage or com-
puting resources to the
network. With the costs
to companies which base
their business on surveil-
lance for inevitable data
breaches justly imposed
by GDPR, this seems in-
creasingly the more viable
option.
“GDPR cannot
protect
personal
information
from being
collected, or
guarantee it
will not be
compromised”
What you can do?
1. Take a moment to review your privacy options over the
next few days in your apps. Get to know what information is
collected about you and if you can disable it.
2. You don’t have to agree to the terms and conditions. Instead
ofGoogle,OneDrive,andWhatsAppwhynottryDuckDuckGo
Search (https://ddg.gg ), CryptPad (https://cryptpad.fr/ ),
or Telegram (https://telegram.org/) which offer equivalent
services for free but do not collect unnecessary amounts
of personalized information. The website “PRISM Break”
(https://prism-break.org/en/all/) has further suggestions.
3. Takepartinmakingabetterweb.Areyouareinterestedinthe

sary risk to the health of
our society, concentrating
knowledge which could
be used to influence
peoples’ behaviour in the
hands of a small number
of organizations.
We need to take action,
using our rights to make
sure the World Wide Web
does no further harm
to society. As a society
we need to rethink the
business models behind
the services we use , and
redesign technology so
as to ensure that our data
cannot be breached in the
first place by replacing
our current centralized
systems.
As an individual, take
the opportunity now to
find out what information
services collect about you.
With exams over, why not
download your Facebook
data and play around with
it if you are so inclined?
Furthermore you do not
have to agree to the terms
and conditions if you are
uncomfortable! Why not
support efforts to make
the web more open and try
an alternative service such
as DuckDuckGo instead
of Google, or Telegram
instead of WhatsApp. For
more ideas on what you
can do see below.
Organizations are
taking GDPR seriously.
That barrage of emails and
popups may be annoying,
but it is a sign that compa-
nies are concerned about
not complying.
However, GDPR
cannot protect personal
information from being
collected or guarantee it
will not be compromised.
Most websites on the
World Wide Web today
rely on personalized
advertising in order to
“The power of
information
collected
by websites
could be used
to engineer
society to
various
political aims”
One solution is to treat
services such as social
media platforms as crucial
infrastructure, and divide
up their administration
among independent or-
ganisations. This would
come at the advantage of
greater robustness as well
as security, since there
would no single point
of attack. An example is
the social media network
Diaspora as a replace-
ment for Facebook, in
which you can establish
your own “pod” which
manages data.
The primary issue
with this option is that of
apathy amongst Internet
users. Social media have
an inherent tendency to
monopolization, because
their value is increased
by each user who joins
the network. This makes
the GDPR’s requirement
for data portability rather
weak, since there is no
equivalent service where
you can pack up bags and
go if you are unhappy.
Another option would
“We need to
take action,
using our
rights to
make sure the
World Wide
Web does no
further harm
to society”
GDPR is a fine
achievement of European
politics. The combination
of clear guidelines, robust
implementation, and a
genuine commitment is
making already making a
real change to the attitude
people and organizations
have about privacy. The

COMMENT

E
ven if you didn’t
read Kapilan’s
article in last
week’s Felix
(Felix 1696), the new
General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) will
not have escaped your
attention thanks to the
barrage of emails you will
have received over the
past few weeks.
GDPR could have a
profound influence on the
future of the World Wide
Web. Just as the Kyoto
Protocol showed nations
can come together to
take meaningful action
for the future of the
natural world, GDPR
shows nations can come
together for the future of
the cybernetic world. For
too long the World Wide
Web, originally a decen-
tralized means of freely
sharing information, has
become centralized and
monopolized by a few
key players. The risks are
demonstrated by countless
data breaches, the worst
revealed this year being
the Cambridge Analytica
files and MyFitnessPal
cases. We each need to
realise what information
is being collected about
us, and to take action not
just as a society, but as
individuals. Legislation
alone is not enough to
ensure that our infor-
mation is not used to do
harm – We must break
up monopolies, change
business models from
profit to non-profit, and
redesign our technology
so it is physically impos-
sible for information to be
disclosed.
From allegedly influ-
encing the outcome of
elections (as in the Cam-
bridge Analytica case)
to revealing the location
of secret army bases in
Afghanistan (Strava,
November 2017) breaches
of data or the plain incom-
petence of centralized
services are having real
impacts on our society,
right now. In the former
the personal conversa-
tions and information
of 87 million Facebook
users was breached by a
rogue questionnaire app
without consent. This
only emerged in March,
three years after the
event. In the latter, Strava
released a map of every
single route uploaded to
their system – more than
3 trillion points. The map
was sufficiently detailed
to show routes uploaded
by US soldiers in Afghan-
istan giving away sensi-
tive information about the
layout of military bases.
Furthermore, the monopo-
lization of global services
by corporations tied to the
laws of individual nations
is harming competition
and is inherently undem-
ocratic.

Your Rights under GDPR
As stated on the EU commission’s
website under GDPR you have the right to:
1. information about the processing of
your personal data;
2. obtain access to the personal data
held about you;
3. ask for incorrect, inaccurate or
incomplete personal data to be
corrected;
4. request that personal data be erased
when it’s no longer needed or if
processing it is unlawful;
5. object to the processing of your
personal data for marketing
purposes or on grounds relating to
your particular situation;
6. request the restriction of the
processing of your personal data in
specific cases;
7. receive your personal data in a
machine-readable format and
send it to another controller (‘data
portability’);
8. request that decisions based on
automated processing concerning
you or significantly affecting you
and based on your personal data are
made by natural persons, not only by
computers. You also have the right
in this case to express your point of
view and to contest the decision.
Companies found to be in breach of
GDPR are subject to a maximum fine of €20
million or 4% of global annual turn-over
