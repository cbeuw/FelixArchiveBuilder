Resistance to this album is futile
W
ho are the
M a n i c
S t r e e t
Preachers?
They’re hailed as indie
rock kings.
They’re known for a
slick bit of politics.
Resistance is Futile
gives us that, but better.
Building off their old
classics ‘Motorcycle
Emptiness’ and ‘A Design
For Life’, this eagerly an-
ticipatedalbumopenswith
‘People Give In’, an eerie
key riff suspending us for
a brief moment – what are
these hipster vibes – then,
fuck! They’re back with
a sick triplet feel groove,
alternating each bar with
a momentum shift on the
3&4. The chorus is full
and welcoming with lots
of strings, setting the vibe
very well for the rest of
the album. Bradfield hits
his classic falsetto right
where it’s needed. A solid
start to a great album.
We segue into ‘Inter-
national Blue’ and travel
into fucking spacetime.
Lots of drive and distorted
rhythm, Manic Street
Preachers giving us some
proper energy to chew
on here. Like a virgin
having a one night stand
this drive doesn’t last
for long – we come to
lovely ‘Vivian’, the first
slow track on this album.
Clicks and scrapes in the
background set the tone
for the minor verse. We
cruise for a while before
MSP break back into
their classic major solo,
using the same call and
response, vocal and guitar
play they always find a
place for – like ‘All We
Make is Entertainment’
(Postcards from a Young
Man, 2010). It’s good if
you’re a fan. It’s good if
you’ve never listened to
them. Man, I don’t know
who this isn’t good for,
you know?
Five songs in we hit
a real sweet spot. Like
Stella’s-back-at-the-un-
ion sweet fucking spot.
‘Dylan & Caitlin’ features
The Anchoress, with a
voice like the bastard
child of Lana del Rey and
David Bowie. (Question:
if that child actually
existed, would she be hot?
How much therapy would
she require?) Anyway,
you’re probably wonder-
ing why you’ve never
heard of an artist that’s
on a Manics album, and
so am I. She has just over
1200 monthly listeners on
Spotify, a mere fraction
of Manics 1 million. Her
debut album Confessions
of a Romance Novelist
was released in 2016
with little success, but the
Manics have a real eye for
talent. So get to it, sheep,
get following. I promise
it’ll be worth it.
The album is yet
another excellent, if
expected, political cry.
They have stayed true
to their name and their
style, with a solid and
vibrant 4/4 groove, major
keyed jams and tasteful
guitar solos. Whether it’s
getting a bit repetitive, I
don’t know… but on the
off-chance you don’t like
this album I challenge
you to listen to Journal
for Plague Lovers and
Postcards From a Young
Man. Then listen to this
again. Then ask yourself:
Who the fuck are the
Manic Street Preachers
and how could I not love
them?
The queen of summertime sadness continues her reign
L
ykke Li’s 4th
studio album,
so sad so sexy
is her first in
four years. During this
break, she grappled with
the artistic block she
experienced as she had
a child and mourned the
loss of her mother. Youth
Novel, Wounded Rhymes,
and I Never Learn were
a trilogy; exploring the
trials and tribulations of
her twenties, Li said writ-
ing the three albums set
her free, but it is apparent
from her latest album she
is yet to step down from
her throne as queen of
summertime sadness.
Her first single from
the album, ‘hard rain’, is
the opening track. At the
start, her distinct voice,
backed by synths, croons
out in a style reminiscent
of her previous album, but
is quickly layered with
others, taking on a more
robotic quality. The pro-
duction is also distinctly
clean, and the influences
from American hip-hop
are clear. The next track,
‘deep end’ has a dubstep
edge. ‘two nights’ starts
like a piano backed
ballad that could belong
on either of Li’s other
albums, but a feature from
Portland rapper Amine
sets it apart. His flow is
sharp and punchy, con-
trasting beautifully with
Li’s melodic warbling.
The next few tracks are
self-indulgent in a way
only Lykke Li can pull
off. “Let me keep the last
piece of my heart, before
you tear it all apart” she
laments on ‘last piece’,
before concluding “I
know we’re gonna make
it someday” on ‘jaguars in
the air’. Both tracks have
repetitive lyrics, making
them irritating at first, but
impossibly catchy by the
fourth or fifth listen.
ironic. Even some names
of songs: ‘sex money
feelings die’, ‘so sad
so sexy’, ‘bad woman’,
and ‘better alone’ are
somewhat eyeroll-in-
ducing, but Li deals with
them so genuinely, with
a self-deprecating edge,
that you can’t help but
get on board. Cynicism
is difficult to sustain with
emotion delivered so
authentically. The album
closes on the powerful
‘utopia’. It was originally
shared by Li on social
media as a tribute on
Mother’s Day with the
note: “MOTHER TO
MOTHER TO MOTHER.
Utopia is all my mother
ever wanted for me and
all I ever want for him.
		 ”.
The tribute is poignant,
but delivers an optimistic
ending.

Man on Blonde: a masterpiece revisited
Music Writer Ben Man takes a look back at Frank Ocean’s thoughtful, experimental, beautiful Blonde, nearly two
years on from its release.
T
he artist known
as Frank Ocean,
born Christopher
Breaux, was
born and raised in New
Orleans, Louisiana. He
studied English at New
Orleans University,
writing music on the side,
before Hurricane Katrina
destroyed his studio and
uprooted his life. Ocean
made the decision to
move to Los Angeles
to fully pursue music,
earning a song-writing
deal, penning lyrics and
melodies for other artists
before joining up with the
OFWGKTA (Odd Future)
hip-hop/art collective and
signing a contract with
Def Jam records. He then
released the highly ac-
claimed Nostalgia, Ultra
mixtape in 2011, before
working on other music
including songs on Kanye
West and Jay-Z’s Watch
the Throne and Beyoncé’s
Beyoncé. In the midst of
Ocean’s momentous rise
to success, he released an
open letter on his Tumblr
account recounting his
unrequited love for a male
friend one summer when
he was 19 years old. He
released the Grammy-
winning album Channel
Orange in 2012, and
then – after a four-year
silence – Ocean released
the visual album Endless,
and the album Blonde.
I’ve been regularly
listening to Blonde for
the past 18 months. The
album never gets stale:
Ocean has packed so
many ideas into 17 songs
that each listen reveals
another layer of musical
and lyrical content.
In terms of sound, the
atmospheric, sometimes
ethereal Blonde contrasts
to the cinematic, more ac-
cessible Channel Orange.
The mood of the album
is melancholy, reflective,
and introspective.
“The album
never gets
stale: Ocean
has packed
in so many
ideas that each
listen reveals
another layer
of musical and
lyrical content”
Previous reviews of
Channel Orange said
Ocean has pushed the
boundaries of R&B,
causing him to state his
dislike for such a label,
saying it’s “inaccurate
when you’re making
music inspired by so
many different things”.
Moving forward, Blonde
completely transcends
classification. A flowing
channel of collaborators
runs through the album,
with Ocean melding
them together to create a
sound that fits his vision.
The collaborators aren’t
given the spotlight, but
are mostly used akin to
session musicians: Ra-
diohead guitarist Jonny
Greenwood provides
swelling string arrange-
ments on ‘Seigfried’,
Beyonce adds her backing
vocals to a harmonic
orchestra of voices at the
end of ‘Pink + White’,
Andre 3000 of Outkast
spits a frantic verse on
‘Solo (Reprise)’, and – in a
pleasant surprise – rapper
Yung Lean’s murmurs are
used as vocal texture in
‘Godspeed’.
Each song on the
album shifts and changes
throughout the course of
listening. Ocean changes
his melodies with each
song, leading to much less
repetition than previous
works, giving Blonde
depth by refraining
from forcing hooks and
choruses on the listener.
Ocean similarly treats his
voice to an instrument,
layering it in a swelling
choir on ‘White Ferrari’,
and applying changing
effects to it in songs such
as ‘Nikes’.
The changing melodies
are compounded by fluid,
continuously changing
soundscapes. In ‘Nikes’,
foggy synths, keyboards,
and cinematic samples
subtly blend into each
other as they enter and
exit the song, accompa-
nied by a sparse, changing
drum line.
The musicians on
Blonde often separately
provided parts on songs
without ever hearing the
final product, contributing
to the ethereal mood of
the album as ambient,
disconnected lines slowly
slide in and out of focus.
Keyboardist Buddy Ross,
who provided the backing
track for ‘Facebook Story’
and ‘Be Yourself’, said
“[Ocean] has this vision
that no one else really is
privy to. A lot of times
you don’t even know what
you’re working on. He
just puts blinds on every-
body and sends them off
in their own space to just
do whatever they want”.
Blonde is sonically
bare in comparison to the
bolder Channel Orange,
with more subtle harmo-
nies and a minimal range
of instruments. Drum
parts appear on under half
the album. Ocean is often
only accompanied by a
single guitar or keyboard,
serving to further empha-
sise the imagery of his
lyrics, the melody, and
the emotional tone of his
voice.
Ocean’s feelings are
palpable through the tone
of his voice alone – he
alternates between tender
and reflective in ‘Ivy’,
offers solemn, emotional
prayer on ‘Godspeed’,
and gives a frenetic
declaration backed by
something approaching a
choral summoning chant
on ‘Pretty Sweet’.
He remains a powerful
storyteller, able to
invoke strong images
and feelings through his
lyrics. “Remember when
I had that Lexus, no, our
friendship don’t go back
that far”, he wryly sings on
‘Futura Free’. On ‘Good
Guy’, Ocean reminisces
about meeting someone in
New York from a dating
app, reflecting “You text
nothing like you look”
and “here’s where I
realised you talk so much
more than I do”. Standout
imagery comes from the
spoken word section on
‘Seigfried’, where Ocean
says “Less morose and
more present/Dwell on
my gifts for a second/A
moment, one solar flare
we’re consumed, so why
not/spend this flammable
paper on the film that’s
my life”.
One slight gripe comes
with ‘Solo (Reprise)’,
which is difficult to listen
to casually, due to its
dissonant sound and pace
compared to the rest of
the album. The standout
songs on the album can
genuinely change with
time as different things
are taken from the album,
but the transcendent
moment when the drums
start on ‘Pretty Sweet’ is a
genuine highlight.
Ocean’s commitment
to his vision, ability to
consistently break new
ground, and refusal to
compromise what he
creates have produced a
masterpiece. He is one of
the best musicians of his
generation. I’ve had more
than a few dreams where
I’ve met Frank Ocean and
didn’t really know what to
say.
They say he lives in
Notting Hill, about half an
hour away from Imperial
campus. It would probably
be better for music’s sake
if we didn’t disturb him.
