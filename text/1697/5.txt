manipulative relationship, and advises others on what to do if they’re in the same position.

A
t the beginning
of a relation-
ship there is
passion, not
love. Love is built upon
passion, but it doesn’t
necessarily exist after
passion. Some people are
mature and caring enough
to be able to build the
love, some are not: it is
as simple as that. To love
someone, you must love
yourself first: you have
to know yourself, to be
sure of who you are and
what you want in life. If
you are not self-aware,
self-conscious, there is no
way you will be able to
love someone.
sorry, I am like this with
the people I love”. Let me
tell you something: that is
not love.
I was the one cleaning
up the mess. I do not
have the best background
when it comes to rela-
tionships: I grew up in an
environment of domestic
violence, a totally abusive
relationship. Research
says I will now, when
finding a partner, try to fix
what was not fixed back
then between my parents;
living in that environment
made me stronger but
also made me much more
tolerant to bullshit.
I did not respect myself
in my first real relation-
ship. I realise now my
first true love gives me
more anger than good
memories. It is not sad
to realise that; in fact, it
makes me grow, it makes
me more aware, so I do
not repeat the mistake.
I have got nothing to
lose by writing this; in
fact, it only makes me
reflect more about what
I did to myself. No, I do
not blame myself. I have
no right to blame myself.
I lost myself because I
gave everything I had. It
would have been fine if
that everything had been
given to me – from me to
me – but, surprise: it was
not. You grow by making
mistakes, and I commit-
ted one of the biggest
mistakes of my life so far:
I gave myself away, com-
pletely, entirely. Months
after, I found myself
in pieces, from being
trampled on numerous
times. You would think
I would realise what was
going on, but I did not.
Currently, I am slowly
gluing the pieces back
together. Sometimes, a
piece falls and I have to
pick it up again, without
really knowing if it will
stick properly this time.
It is a constant fight, a
constant fight to redis-
cover me. I want it to
be clear: I do not need a
Leave. There is nothing to
lose. If you stay, you will
lose yourself. So, leave.
I have no shame to say
I got out of it by being
broken up with. That is
okay. I still get to leave, I
still get to grow, and I still
get to realise all the shit
that happened during the
relationship: specially all
the red flags that existed, I
noticed, and I ignored.

sticker saying “fragile”.
If I were to be described
that way, then the whole
world would have to be
described that way too.
Accepting yourself is
the first step to take before
entering any relationship.
If you do, do not be with
someone who does not
accept themselves. I did
this and found myself in
a cycle, trying to make
things better when there
was really nothing I could
do, because he was only
fighting against himself. If
you feel like leaving, just
leave. If you feel like you
are losing yourself, leave.
If it feels like it is not right,
it is because it is not right.
By not knowing
yourself or having your
shit together you can
easily drag those who
care for you down with
your mess: no one has to
deal with your shit. If you
have a partner, they do
not exist to clean up your
mess; they exist to support
you and help you, but that
does not mean that they
have to deal with selfish
behaviour on your part,
with you saying “I am so
“If I were to
be described
as‘fragile’the
whole world
would have to
be too”
I wrote this because I
am sure I am not alone.
I want to make people
aware of my story, because
I know this is happening
to multiple people right
now I feel if I had read
something like this while
still in the relationship
things could have been
different; I would have
been able to raise my head
up and leave earlier, or be
able to make the red flags
real, and not just thoughts
to ignore.
Do not let yourselves
go. Do not forget about
yourselves. Do not lose
yourselves. If the world
has the right to take
advantage of you, then
you have the right to take
advantage of the world.
You have the right to think
about yourself first. You
have the right to not give
a fuck. You have the right
to be yourself. You should
remain yourself. You have
to remain yourself – at the
end of the day, you have
only got yourself.
This year Union Council has been completely
toxic – it’s time for change
An anonymous student talks about how the machinations of various groups on the Council
are bad for all of us and will eventually tear it apart.

rom a particular
p e r s p e c t i v e ,
Imperial College
Union is an
organisation which has
always been defined
by negativity. After all,
students wouldn’t be
motivated to make things
better if they thought that
things were already good
enough. Usually, this neg-
ativity is channelled into
productivity; the drive to
improve things has been
at the heart of virtually
every positive change the
Union has brought about
at Imperial. Volunteers
and sabbatical officers
have always worked
together for the common
good of Imperial’s student
body – even if they often
disagreed on details or
didn’t get along particu-
larly well.
this year it has grown
toxic. Personal animosity
has been allowed to dictate
the agenda; proposals
are voted down purely
because of who proposed
them, without any con-
sideration of their merit.
Hard-working volunteers
are sniped at and openly
undermined in meetings,
and partisan emails are
sent to society mailing
lists – one described
Union Council members
as “people who care very
little about students, and
are using their seat on
Council just as a stepping
stone to more senior
Union positions.” Worse
statements have been
made in private.
This toxicity is not
limited to one or two
prominent individuals.
Rather, two distinct
factions have emerged,
which together account
for virtually the entirety of
the Union’s senior officer
cohort, from Constituent
Union committees all
the way up to the Officer
Every action and every
proposal is viewed almost
exclusively through the
prism of which faction the
individual is more closely
associated with; no more
does the Union’s senior
officer community accept
– even begrudgingly –
positive steps proposed
by those they don’t get
along with personally.
Instead, flimsy excuses
are cobbled together to
make sure that ‘they’
don’t achieve anything.
After all, isn’t it best that
nothing at all happens, just
so long as ‘the other side’
don’t get the credit…?
I have always, through-
out my time holding
volunteering roles, been
particularly optimistic,
despite the Union’s
negativity. I have always
believed the Union could
achieve great things,
if only we could work
together, and have worked
to try to bring about
that unanimity and find
common ground on diffi-
cult issues. However, the
working atmosphere has
been so bad in the Union
this year I have several
times seriously considered
simply walking away. It
may be that this year has
been an aberration, a bad
bunch of people incapable
of working together. I sin-
cerely hope so; the Union
is doomed to failure in
everything it does if its
culture does not improve.
Every single student with
an elected role next year
must do everything they
can to make sure that it
never gets this bad again;
to fail to do so is to doom
the Union.
Grumpy Bastard and the World Cup
Grumpy Bastard is looking forward to the World Cup. Because they hate themselves.
W
elcome to
the end of
the year.
Whether it’s
your first, second, third,
or even fourth year at this
fine institution, I’m sure
you have all arrived in the
same manner: bedraggled,
exhausted, and with the
eyes of a survivor of an
artillery barrage on the
Western Font. For those
of you still here beyond

four years, please contact
the police, as you prob-
ably have an advanced
and untreatable form of
Stockholm Syndrome as
well as chronic self-hate.
If I’m honest, the self-hate
never really goes, you just
learn to hate everyone else
until it feels normal.
I am really looking
forward to the summer
this ear, mostly because
of the World Cup. As an
ashamed Englishperson,
it really is wonderful to
go through the same mas-
ochistic expectation that
maybe this year, the boys
in white will make it all the
way, only to eventually be
defeated by some country
that no one has even heard
of, like Belgium. I think
it’s entirely in keeping
with a people that loathes
itself so completely as to
vote the Tories into power
that we care desperately
about a sport that we have
absolutely no hope of
winning. It almost brings
a patriotic tear to my eye.
Another wonderful
aspect of the World Cup
this year is the country
in which it is held. Never
before has an openly
expansionist, homophobic
regime landed itself with
such a propaganda coup.
Come to think of it, I
can think of one other
regime, but I don’t think
that the Nazis had to bribe
the Olympic officials
anywhere near as much
as Putin had to give to
Sep Blatter and all of his
friends. Something that
could be very interesting
could be when the rival
nationalist “firms” come
into contact with one
another. Firms, in case you
didn’t know are groups of
young en taht associate
with different football
clubs and occasionally
meet to beat the shit out
of one another. I guess if
I was from Manchester
I’d want an early death
too. As two nations with
a history of violence and
then making it the rest
of the world’s problem, I
think it will be really nice
to watch a proper confron-
tation between the pair of
us. Let’s just hope that
the FSB stops threatening
the Mafia bosses and firm
leaders long enough for
the true competition to
take place. I mean it’s not
like they do it the rest of
the time.
Overall, I can’t say I
have high expectations
of this summer’s football
related phenomena. I just
expect to be greeted by
the site of more England
flags, a surge in the
membership of the EDL
and more obnoxious dick-
heads blowing Vuvuzelas
in public. All I want is for
them to shut up so that I
can continue to worry
about the implications of
the Singapore conference
in peace. That and shitting
myself over exam results.
Grumpy Bastard would
like to wish everyone the
best for the summer, but
is completely unable to.
Goodbye dickheads.
“This year the
atmosphere
in the Union
has grown
completely
toxic”
This year, however,
something has changed.
Whereas previously the
atmosphere amongst
senior Union officers has
been fairly polite, if not
exactly always friendly,
“The Union
is doomed
to failure in
everything
it does if its
culture does
not improve”
Trustees – who at times
in the year have happily
contributed to the ev-
er-worsening atmosphere.
