How representative is our sample?
In terms of gender identity, the
proportions are roughly in line with
the overall student split at Imperial.
However, undergraduates are vastly
over-represented within the results: in
reality, undergraduates only make up
around 55% of the student population.
Postgraduates tend to be less engaged
with student life at Imperial – as
evidenced by election turnout – so
perhaps they were less likely to take the
Sex Survey; or perhaps undergraduates
are just more comfortable with people
poking around in their business…
Obtaining data on sexual identity
is notoriously difficult. The most
recent governmental data, from 2016,
reported 2% of the UK population
identifies as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.
This was doubled in the 16-24 age
group, but still falls well below the
results of the Sex Survey, where over
one in five respondents said they were
something other than heterosexual.

The majority of students at
Imperial have popped their
cherry, although there is still a
significant minority who have
not.
On average, people seemed
satisfied with the age they
lost their virginity: the ‘ideal
age’ was 17.48, which was
essentially equal to the average
age respondents lost their
virginity.

For the second year running, Physics gets the participation medal –
they were the department most represented in the respondents. The
Departments of Life Sciences and Medicine followed close behind. At
the Faculty level, however, the Faculty of Engineering came out top, with
nearly half of repondants doing an engineering course.
Somewhat surprisingly, when students were asked how Imperial had affected
their sex life, the responses were pretty even across the board. On the whole,
people generally thought Imperial had affected their sex life positively. However,
this result is made less useful by the fact we didn’t put in a baseline measure –
whether students thought their sex life would be better at another university, for
example.
It could be that – since the majority of people become sexually active around
the time they are going to university – sex lives would inevitably improve once
people arrived at university, irrespective of where they went. Nevertheless, there
remained a significant proportion who felt Imperial had worsened their sex life.
The Department of Life Sciences was judged to be the hottest
department, followed by Medicine and Bioengineering. Looking at
distribution of votes, however, a clear pattern emerges: students were
highly likely to say the department to which they belonged was the
hottest. This is particularly clear with the Departments of Medicine, Life
Sciences, and Bioengineering. Students from the Department of Earth
Science and Engineering were also likely to rate themselves as attractive,
despite coming near the middle of the rankings as a whole.
While Life Sciences was the most attractive department, people
thought Medicine was the department that had the most sex. Breaking
the votes down by department, there is less of a clear pattern, although
all departments generally thought Medicine had the most sex. This is with
the exception of ESE, who – again – thought they themselves had the
most sex.
In terms of the least sex, students felt Computing students were getting
the least action; nobody felt this more strongly than Computing students
themselves. Other departments which felt they should have more sex
included Maths, Aeronautics, and EEE
