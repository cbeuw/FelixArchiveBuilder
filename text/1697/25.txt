egular users
of Gloucester
Road tube sta-
tion may have
noticed a rather surreal
visitor cropping up last
week. The disused rail
platform, lying opposite
the District and Circle
line platforms, has been
occupied by a dizzying
array of eggs: eggs
coming out of shower
heads; eggs cracked open
by nails; fried eggs lying
flush against the floor of
the platform, as dark and
grimy as a used frying
pan. It’s the project of
Heather Phillipson, a
British artist who works
across a wide range of
media, constructing dense
tapestries of meaning
that echo our hyperreal
modern life, in which
we are bombarded with
visual information from
all sides.
The installation, my
name is lettie eggsyrub,
takes up the entirety of
the 80m platform, and
will occupy the space for
an entire year. Phillipson
describes the project as “a
subterranean disturbance,
in which hyper-real,
creaturely simulations
and analogue counterparts
dwarf passengers,” and
while commuters aren’t
known for being that
aware of the world around
them – London etiquette
demands a rigorous
refusal to focus anywhere
except your feet/your
phone/empty space – the
sheer scale of Phillipson’s
work makes it hard to
ignore.
While the installation
is new, the ethos behind
it is not. Artists have been
making use of Gloucester
Road station since 2003,
when Cindy Sherman
erected ten giant self-por-
traits; Sherman’s work
plays with the question of
gender and identity, with
Sherman donning nau-
sea-inducing prosthetics
to abstract herself into
other personalities. Before
Phillipson’s work was
installed, the arches of the
platform framed photo-
graphs by Trevor Paglen,
looking out over a bucolic
English landscape, whose
horizon was punctured
by squat geodesic domes
housing US surveillance
equipment.
All the projects that
have made use of the
Gloucester Road platform
have been organised by
Art on the Underground,
a branch of Transport
for London (TFL) which
uses the tube network as
a vast gallery space. The
programme was origi-
nally called Platform for
Art, and was founded in
2000, acquiring its current
name in 2007; it’s headed
up by a team of curators
and producers, advised
by a panel including those
working in the arts and
within TFL, as well as
practicing artists.
Since its inception, the
programme has allowed
artists to create a number
of significant works,
and changed the way
commuters and tourists
experience the world’s
oldest metro system. One
of the most recognisable
and frequently-changing
interventions is the cover
of the tube map booklets,
which can be picked up
in the majority of station
ticket areas. Since 2003,
they have been inviting a
rotating roster of artists to
design the cover, drawing
on a range of influences,
most noticeably the
design of the map itself.
The result is a series of
artworks that, when col-
lected together, function
as a miniature exhibition;
Art on the Underground
have commissioned some
of the most influential
artists working today, in-
cludingRachelWhiteread,
Mona Hatoum, and Yayoi
Kusama, who have all
brought their artistic
trademarks – use of
negative space; textile
handiwork; psychedelic
dots – to the iconic map.
Taking inspiration from
and drawing on the same
techniques Mughal artists
used to produce exquisite
miniatures, Qureshi said
his work would help
create “a completely new
atmosphere and a positive
energy,” but it retains an
unmistakable sense of
violence. The individual
segments of flora are sur-
rounded by small splashes
– the fly in the ointment
that calls to mind spots of
blood, and unsettles the
gentle image.
American artist Barbara
Kruger, whose work
interrogates the meaning
of words and language,
turned her attention to the
tube map cover back in
2010: her version takes
a selection of the map
around Charing Cross,
where the station names
have been replaced with
totemic values. Waterloo
becomes Vigilance;
Holborn is renamed Joy;
and Oxford Circus takes
on Perfection. The result
is a witty visual puzzle,
that leads the viewer to
make links between the
different stations: you can
take a journey from Joy
to Devotion to Compas-
sion, for example, while

I’ve got a couple of
favourites from the series:
firstly, Imran Qureshi’s All
Time Would be Perpetual
Spring, which sees the Pa-
kistani-born artist drawing
delicate, beautiful floral
patterns using the colours
of underground tube lines.

iconic designs, and giant eggs invaders…
“The vision of
the London
Underground
network
branched into
all areas of art
and design”
Fame abuts too close to
Pride for comfort. It is
reminiscent of Simon
Patterson’s fantastic 1992
piece The Great Bear,
which saw the tube lines
become categories of
person – philosophers,
scientists, explorers – and
the stations individuals
through history.
Of course, all these
works are themselves
drawing upon an iconic
piece of urban design: the
tube map itself. It can be
difficult to imagine the
tube map looking like
anything other than our
current design, but from
the foundation of the un-
derground through to the
1930s, transit authorities
made use of a geographi-
cally-accurate map, which
resulted in a massive
crush in the centre, tube
lines wriggling over each
other like vipers, while
suburban lines stretched
out into emptiness.
It wasn’t until 1931
that things started to get
cleaned up. Harry Beck,
an engineering draftsman
in the London Under-
ground Signals Office,
realised commuters
didn’t necessarily care
about where the stations
were in proximity to one
another since they’d be
travelling underground,
losing their sense of
direction – instead, they
needed a simple topolog-
ical map, which would
tell them how to get from
one station to another,
and where they needed
to change lines. Taking
inspiration from electrical
circuit diagrams, Beck
spaced out the stations so
they were equally distant
apart, and used only 90 or
45 degree angles within
the diagram. The first
map, finished in 1931, has
a strong resemblance to
the modern map we know
today – it was easy to read,
the extra details had been
removed, and the lines
had an identifiable colour.
Originally rejected,
Beck returned to the
drawing board, making
small changes to the
design, and submitting
it again the next year;
this time the authorities
tentatively went for it,
paying Beck £10 for the
design, and producing a
small run of maps, which
were immediately popular
among the general public.
Over the next thirty years
Beck produced maps for
the London Underground,
which gradually increased
in complexity as more
lines were added, until
an uncredited design led
Beck and his employers to
fall out; Beck continued
to produce maps in his
own spare time, but none
were produced, and he
died in 1974, at the age of
72. It wasn’t until 1997,
more than two decades
after his death, that his
contribution was formally
recognised on current
maps. Hugely influential,
the London Underground
map is a work of art in
its own right, one that has
been emulated by under-
ground networks across
the world.
The tube map is just
one example of the unified
vision of the London
Underground network,
which branched into all
areas of art and design.
This unique aspect of the
transport network can be
traced back to Frank Pick,
who started as publicity
officer for the Under-
ground Electric Railways
Company of London
(UERL), a precursor of
the London Underground,
before becoming its
managing director.
Pick introduced a
number of key design
elements that would
become emblematic of
the tube, including the
iconic roundel – the red
ring struck through with
a blue bar – which he had
Edward Johnston develop
from the previous clunky
design of a solid red
circle in 1913. Pick also
commissioned Johnston
to develop a signature
font for the UERL to
use, giving them a clear
brand identity. The result,
Johnston, was instantly
revolutionary: one of the
first humanist san-serif
typefaces, it would later
go on to inspire other de-
signers, such as Eric Gill
and Frederic Goudy, and
can be seen as a precursor
to fonts such as Tahoma or
Calibri.
Pick’s influence didn’t
just extend to visual
design, however – he
was also commissioned
architect Charles Holden
to design a number of un-
derground stations, many
of which remain iconic
to this day. While other
transit systems, such as
Paris’ Métro, were largely
built within a compressed
time frame, the London
Underground was com-
pleted over a number
of decades, as new
generations and shifting
demographics demanded
more lines to be opened;
the result is a panoply of
station design, where a
single train journey could
take you from Italinante,
to art deco, to high-tech.
In total 71 stations
have buildings which are
listed, while a number of
others have entrances or
exits within other listed
buildings. Holden’s
designs, many of which
are themselves listed, are
among the most iconic –
although Leslie Green’s
beautiful oxblood tile-clad
designs (see Gloucester
Road station) come a
close second. Holden’s
work comes in two
main flavours: the first
can be seen in the 1926
extension to the Northern
Line, with huge plate
glass murals featuring
the Roundel embedded
within a Portland stone
facade, and a long awning
over the entranceway;
the second is found in
the later Piccadilly Line
extension, with stations
made of a series of inter-
locking shapes – spheres,
cylinders, cuboids – that
would extend horizon-
tally and vertically. Of
these, perhaps the most
impressive is Southgate
station: circular in its
design, it seems to have
crashed down on the
North London suburb like
a UFO, an allusion aided
by the Tesla-coil-esque
statue planted on top.
At the centre of Pick’s
mission was a desire to
bring good design to the
average citizen, a project
that Art on the Under-
ground keeps up to this
day.The variety of the tube
network was celebrated in
2013, during its 150th
an-
niversary, with Labyrinth,
an installation by Mark
Wallinger, which takes
the form of 270 unique
black and white maze
tiles, with one installed at
each station. In July 2016,
less than a month after
the Brexit vote, Art on the
Underground launched
their #LondonIsOpen
series, which invited
artists to create works
celebrating diversity and
inclusion showing how
London would remain a
global city, regardless of
the political climate.
Some may balk at a
public institution making
a political point in such
a way, but the history of
the London Underground
network shows it has
always been a quietly
radical force. Anything
that brings art down
from the gallery space,
and into the realm of
people’s lives, allowing
it to become part of their
everyday environment,
is in itself political. And
so, if you happen to go
through Gloucester Road
station within the next
year, make sure to check
out Heather Phillipson’s
eggs, and think about how
it’s just another step in
one of the largest public
art projects to have ever
existed.
