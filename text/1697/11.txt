God save the Childqueen
LA psychedelic-soul artist Kadhja Bonet returns with Childqueen, the follow-up to her breakthrough LP The
Visitor, displaying her instrumental skills and syrupy vocals.
T
here is a double
pleasure in
discovering the
music of LA
psychedelic-soul artist
Kadhja Bonet. There is,
first of all, the joy to be
found in the music: warm
and inviting, completely
drenched in a sticky sense
of pleasant nostalgia, the
songs seem to have been
beamed to us directly
from the 1970s. This sense
of timelessness seems to
place Bonet’s work among
the legion of record store
oddities, which gathered
dust in crates before being
recognised as brilliant
works – musicians like
Linda Perhacs and Kim
Jung Mi spring to mind,
not due to sonic simi-
larities, but more in the
sense we are listening to
something that was once
lost, now found.
The second pleasure,
therefore, is finding
that – despite her ‘70s
stylings – Bonet is very
much a modern artist,
who only put out her
debut album a couple of
years ago. Her 2016 LP,
entitled The Visitor, was
a well-curated collection
of beautiful songs, with a
clearly-defined sound – a
curious mixture of soul,
psychedelia, and funk.
The name of the album
was appropriate: Bonet
seems in many ways like
some kind of visitation,
someone plucked from
another time and space,
only touching down for a
brief instance.
“Bonet seems
in many ways
like some kind
of visitation
from another
time and
space”
With Childqueen, her
follow-up, Bonet con-
tinues to plunder from a
vast array of sources, but
develops her confidence,
creating a sound that is ex-
citingly entirely her own.
The first few minutes of
Childqueen sound similar
to The Visitor: on opening
track, ‘Procession’, she
advises us that “every
morning brings a chance
to renew, chance to
renew,” like some kind of
spiritual advisor at dawn.
A marching drum beat
then starts up, the military
atmosphere contrasting
with the funky bass guitar
line and fluttering flutes,
which cut through the
ethereal glittering synths
enshrouding Bonet’s
vocals. The next track,
‘Childqueen’, starts off
with swelling strings,
before morphing into
a laid-back soul track,
which sounds like it
could be played over the
opening credits to a ‘60s
psych-pop film.
From this point on,
however, Bonet makes
a subtle but noticeable
departure from her sound
on The Visitor: while in
her first album the tracks
seemed to be much
more free-floating, on
Childqueen they are often
anchored by a series of
incredibly-funky bass
riffs, giving the songs a lot
more energy and presence.
‘Thoughts Around Tea’,
for example, features
rat-a-tat drums pierced
by stabbing synth pro-
gressions, while a looping
bassline runs underneath
it all; Bonet’s delivery is
fluent and funky, as she
lyrically contorts to fit
around the pulsating beat.
She pulls a similar trick
on ‘Wings’, stretching her
vocals around the music,
elongating a phrase here
and there to create a sense
of relentless motion,
hitting all the right intona-
tions.
‘Mother Maybe’,
one of the early singles
released from the album,
is probably as funky
as Bonet gets: cymbol
tapping is overlaid with
wobbly bass guitar, while
ray-gun synths and organ
warbles flow underneath,
to create a dense tapestry
of sound. This intense
weft and warp cuts out
towards the end of the
track, as Bonet launches
into a series of incredible
vocal runs, displaying her
impressive voice.
And what a voice it is.
Silky smooth, Bonet’s
vocals emanate an inner
warmth; she manages to
sound a little a little like
any number of iconic soul
vocalists – Dusty Spring-
field, Minnie Riperton,
Roberta Flack – while
remaining completely
idiosyncratic. Often she’ll
layer her singing to create
a form of cosmic harmony,
but at times she’ll leave
herself completely
exposed. The majority of
her vocals are delivered
in a sort of whisper-sing-
ing, as if she’s speaking
right into your ear; on
occasion, however, she’ll
let rip, such as on the later
sections of ‘Delphine’.
over her voice, producing
a jelly-like vibrato that
quivers before stealing
into pure, clear notes;
elsewhere, on ‘Joy’, she
multiplies her voice until
it resembles an angelic
chorus. The album ends
with the appropriately
titled ‘…’, which culmi-
nates in a phenomenal
series of vocal acrobatics,
with Bonet inching up
higher, and higher, and
higher, before disap-
pearing, transferred onto
another astral plane most
likely.
Bonet is a hugely
exciting artist. A talented
multi-instrumentalist –
she played pretty much
every instrument on the
album – she came out of
the gate with an instant-
ly-recognisable style,
confident in her ability to
know exactly who she is.
While sampling from the
classic toolbox of psyche-
delia, funk, and soul,
Bonet’s production will
include samples of off-kil-
ter weirdness – chirping
birds, popping bubbles,
a jazzy flute solo – that
ensures it never settles
into normalcy.
On social media, Bonet
has admitted to struggles
with funding; a European
tour was cancelled last
year, after she said she
would be losing too much
money, while her desire to
produce music videos has
been stymied by financial
worries. It’s clear that, as
an artist, Bonet’s vision is
outstripping her resourc-
es. With the backing she
so dearly deserves, who
knows what heights she
could scale.

“Silky smooth,
Bonet’s
vocals always
emanate an
inner warmth”
It’s the track on this album
that sees Bonet’s vocals
most up-front. The drums
are barely-there, and the
wonky bass, as thick as
syrup, allows plenty of
room for her to break
through the dizziness,
crafting a track that seems
to drip with yearning.
On ‘Another Time
Lover’ she shows us the
excellent control she has
