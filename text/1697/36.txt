ISRAEL TECH TRIP:
LEARNING ABOUT
CULTURE AND TECH
Often featured in the
news for its continuing
conflict, Israel is a
country most people
probably associate with
conflict. However, a little
known fact is that the
country also houses the
highest concentration of
start-ups tech companies
per capita. Given the
country’s young history,
Israel is firmly cemented
in the world of modern
technology. Needless to
say, our expectations were
high when we were given
the opportunity to visit
Israel as part of the Israeli
Society Tech Trip.
Since its inception in
April 2017, the Israeli
Society Tech Trip has
grown exponentially: as
well as taking 55 students
this year, it has also begun
expanding operations
to other universities. To
describe the trip itinerary
as jam-packed would
be an under-statement,
visiting ten companies in
five days in three major
cities. The first day started
off the back of a 4am
arrival into Tel Aviv-Yafo
airport. Then heading
to Jaffa, the Old City,
situated a few kilometers
south of Tel Aviv, where
we soaked up the rich
and vibrant atmosphere,
before hitting the hay at
3am the next day.
Amongst the array of
world-renowned compa-
nies visited on the trip,
Checkpoint stood out the
most. Checkpoint delivers
pioneering cyber-secu-
rity services, and their
talk detailed the current
landscape of cyber-se-
curity. We were treated
that evening to dinner
by some local residents
who used the EatWith
app (https://www.eatwith.
com/), which allows local
residents to open up their
homes for dinner (for a
group of 55 in this case!),
with some live music
through the night.
The tech highlight of
day two was our visit to
local start-ups, Carbyne,
and healthy.io. The former
delivers video capabilities
to emergency calls for
first responders, while the
latter optimises chronic
disease management
using AI. Whilst the
technology piqued our
interest, lunch for that day
was what stole the show
– a food tour of Carmel
Market, tasting the local
delicacies such as sabich
and malabi. Sabich is a
pita filled with aubergine,
eggs, and tahini, whereas
malabi is a rose-flavored
pudding similar to a
blancmange. To bring the
day to a close, we were
honoured by a talk given
by Bennie Schneider, a
serial entrepreneur who
gave some useful tips
about starting out in the
tech industry having sold
his startups, P-Cube and
Pentacom, to Cisco.
Day three started
with a trip to Tel Aviv
University to learn more
about the higher insti-
tutional scene in Israel,
before heading out to a
Kibbutz, a communal
homestead rooted in
agricultural practices, in
the middle of the Negev.
This kibbutz served as
the HQ for Netafim – an
irrigation manufacturer
who managed to cultivate
farmland in the desert
conditions of the Negev.
Then to learn more about
life as an Israeli student,
we were hosted for dinner
by students at Beersheba
University.
To change pace, the
next morning started with
a jaunt down to the Dead
Sea to relax and recover
from what had already
been an action-packed
three days. After a mon-
umental climb back up to
normal altitude, we began
the more cultural aspect
of the trip, starting in Je-
rusalem. Here, we toured
the city, visiting sites such
as the Holy Sepulchre and
the Western Wall. After
soaking in the atmosphere
of the city, we were treated
to an inspirational talk by
Fiona Darmon, COO at Je-
rusalem Venture Partners,
a venture capitalist firm
investing in a diverse
background of compa-
nies. We then headed to
the market, turned from a
bustling food market turn
into a bar, just as busy as it
had been in the day.
Our final day in Israel
started at Yad Vashem,
Israel’s memorial to the
victims of the Holocaust,
where we were walked
through exhibits detail-
ing the atrocities of the
Holocaust. Next on the
agenda was a visit to
the Weizmann Institute,
a higher educational
research centre, where
we learnt more about the
opportunities available
to continue academia in
Israel after university.
MobileEye was the final
tech visit of the trip, and
perhaps one of the most
entertaining. We learnt
more about how self-driv-
ing can be achieved, and
how MobileEye, a startup,
had been bought by Intel
for $15.3bn. We were able
to discuss the technology
behind the system they
had been developing, and
the ethics of self-driving
vehicles, given the recent
news about Tesla and
Uber accidents involving
self-driving vehicles.
The experience as a
whole was truly eye-open-
ing, giving us an inside
look into the history and
future of a young country.
We were able to appreci-
ate both the cultural and
tech aspects of Israel, in a
unique way – a way which
involved us getting ap-
proximately no sleep for
six days, but was worth it
nonetheless.
Thanks to the Israeli
Society Committee for
organising such a mem-
ory-forging, experiential
trip, and we look forward
to seeing it grow in the
future along with the
friendships we made!
