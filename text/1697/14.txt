What do we talk about when we talk about music?
W
hat moti-
vates the
musician?
Compulsive
enjoyment of frissive
frequencies rattling
together in perfect harmo-
ny? Melodies meandering
through modes and motifs,
each refrain serving as
a signifier, a stand-in
for human speech – the
connotations built by our
musical traditions there to
hint at some underlying
meaning? Is it all just
aesthetic in the solitary
Platonic ideal, or is there
a more symbolic point?
A major challenge
in assessing music as a
medium is the compli-
cated interaction between
the literary and the sonic.
Plain-jane three-chord
six-string ballads are just
as capable of captivating
us as the most lavishly-or-
chestrated instrumental
epics of classical music,
or as the deft and dizzying
medley of extended
intervals and enchanting
improvisation that con-
stitute jazz. What’s the
equivalence? After all,
this is the music section,
and at the end of the day
we all just shit out some
rating outta five and go
home.
we fall in love when it
connects. Sure, there’s
aesthetic value to music
– it can be pretty, can’t it?
But pretty isn’t hook-y.
We can enjoy a nice view,
feel sated, and move on
with our lives. Pretty
doesn’t compel us to
interact, to come back and
back again. The works we
love always have a certain
catharsis – a foothold to
identifying with the song
or album that transcends
the ‘simple’ sound. Good
music is more than just
decoration. It includes an
invitation to subsume the
work into yourself.
This necessitates
some kind of symbolic
exchange. The afore-
mentioned catharsis
requires a conveying of
attitude, emotion, inten-
tion, information. You
don’t find information
in random noise, as any
mathematician will tell
you. Musicians cultivate
vocabularies, identifying
themselves with tradi-
tions spanning hundreds
of years. Minor modes
sound sad. Going down a
fifth sounds like coming
home. There’s that phrase
you remember from the
song on the radio when
you realized you lost
your teddy bear seventeen
years ago, and now it
sounds like loss. Nuance
is conveyed in every
aspect of performance –
in picking dynamics, in
harmony, in the way the
band coheres.
Orthogonally, we have
lyrics – perhaps the most
direct means of commu-
nicating intent, but which
themselves can dissolve
into a wonderfully abstract
sea of connotations and
reverberant feeling. To an
earlier point, this is why
rusty strings and off-kilter
strumming can sound so
wonderful; sometimes
they just fit a voice, and
technicality gives way to
the rawness of emotion
otherwise conveyed. And
in this movement, ballads
and jazz fall on equal
footing. Different tradi-
tions, different customs,
to be sure, but the same
latent wish to be read into.
The Western music tra-
dition is a fecund source
of unspecific meaning. We
interpret lines as sounding
bright, dour, space-y, con-
nections formed by years
of listening, interacting,
playing, writing, talking,
thinking. Beauty truly is
in the eye of the beholder;
art is elevated by the
process of interpretation
as much as it is in its very
creation – whether it be a
ramble in a uni paper or a
slick reharm by a talented
artist. It is the very attempt
to interpret a piece of
work’s meaning that gives
that work meaning, a sort
of Deleuzo-Guattarian
reterritorialization-recon-
textualization of intent
that feeds back into a
rich cultural dialogue and
moves the music world
forward.
And so, I beg of
you – don’t just listen to
music. Talk about music.
Think about music. Argue
about music. Participate
in music. There are few
pleasures in life so rich.
I’d like to close this
piece off – and this year
off – by thanking Adrian
and Andy for an amazing
job editing the section,
Fred for being a legendary
Editor-in-Chief, our con-
tributors for their dedica-
tion and their wonderful
opinions on all things
sonic, the copy editors
for their much-needed
and little-appreciated
work behind the scenes,
and, generally, everyone
at Felix for a fantastic
fucking year.
Ah, and you, dear
reader. Thank you.
