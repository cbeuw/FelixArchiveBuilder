In the Survey, we asked
respondents what sex acts
they enjoyed, or would like to
try. On the right you can see
a diagram showing how these
different interests link up. The
red points are individual sex
acts, while the orange lines
indicate common interests:
people who said they were into receiving cunnilingus, for example, were
also more likely to enjoy giving handjobs. The thicker the line, the closer the
association was.
Some clear patterns emerge in the diagram: towards the bottom of the
visualisation were primarily respondents who identified as women, and who
enjoyed, for example, receiving cunnilingus or giving fellatio. In the top right
corner, you’re more likely to find people who identify as men – they enjoy giving
cunnilingus, or getting a handjob.
Towards the centre are acts without significant gender divides – BDSM,
for example, or the use of sex toys. Finally, in the top left corner you can find
responents of a range of genders, who were into what we might term the
‘kinkier’side of sex – orgies, pegging, and watersports.
Within the network, different ‘constellations’ emerge, as associations
are revealed: there’s a strong link between receiving and giving anilingus,
while enjoying threesomes seems to be a gateway drug to pup play – or
vice versa. See what connections you can make out!
Sexual health is always a big topic at universities,
but the Sex Survey revealed a significant proportion
of sexually active people had never been tested.
Overall, 48.4% of sexually active respondents had
never been tested for STIs, with a further 15% tested
more than a year ago. Around 27% of respondents
had been tested within the last six months.
Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, and HIV were the main
infections people were tested for, although a
significant number had also been tested for other
diseases like syphilis. Chlamyida was the most
commonly-diagnosed condition.
For those who hadn’t been tested, a range of
reasons were given. Common responses included
sayingitwastoomuchefforttogettested,ofpeopledidn’tknowwheretogo.Therearenumerous
sexual health clinics located close to Imperial campuses that students can use, with the Jefferiss
Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital, and 10 Hammersmith Broadway being only two examples. More can
be found on the NHS website. Others said they didn’t need to be tested because they were in a
committed relationship, or had only had sex with one person. Felix don’t want to cause dischord
in relationships, but it might be an idea to get tested, just in case. And remember: some STIs will
be largely symptomless until late stages, so don’t wait to get tested!
Birds do it, bees do it, even educated Imperial
students do it. Yes, we’re talking about wanking.
The overwhelming majority of respondants
masturbated from time to time, with the most
common frequency being every few days.
Categories of porn, although predictable, showed significant differences
based on whether the respondant identifyed as heterosexual or not. For
heterosexual respondants, the most popular categories were
‘College’, ‘Teen’, and ‘Lesbian’. Other categories were also popular –
‘Female Friendly’ was surprisingly popular amongst respondants,
largely women, while ‘Point of View’ was popular among pretty
much only men – but there were some clear stand-outs.
Porn watched by non-heterosexual respondants – so bisexual,
gay, lesbian, pansexual etc. – was much more varied, with no single
category emerging as the outright favourite. ‘Teen’ and ‘College’
remained popular, although ‘Lesbian’ was less popular than in the
heterosexual group. ‘Threesome/Orgy’ was more popular, as were
‘Anal’ and ‘Gay’. Non-heterosexual respondants also preferred
‘Amateur’ pornography much more than their heterosexual
counterparts.
18.1% of respondents viewed porn every day, while nearly
half viewerd it a couple of times a week, and the remainder less
frequently. Overall, 13.4% were worried about their consumption
of pornography, while 21.7% were not sure, and 65% didn’t have
concerns. Those watching it every day made up a larger proportion of those
concerned than those who were not.

In the wake of #MeToo, there has been an increased awareness of
sexual misconduct and the need for consent. Reassuringly, respondents
tothesurveyoverwhelminglythoughtconsentneededtobeestablished
before engaging in penetrative sex or removing a condom – an act
known as‘stealthing’, which has been classed as sexual assault or rape in
a number of other countries.
The majority of respondents also thought consent needed to be
established before sexual touching, although a minority did not think
this was the case. Respondents were more mixed on whether kissing
required verbal consent, while the majority of people did not think
verbal consent needed to be established before hand holding.

Over 20% of
respondents had
been to an erotic
dance venue…
…while only 1.6%
of respondents had

Sex sells, as the saying goes. But who’s doing the paying,
and who’s doing the selling? Out of all respondents, 2.7%
had charged for sex in the past, while a significantly higher
proportion – 4.3% – had paid for sex.
Going to an erotic dancing venue, such as a strip club, was
something a significant number of respondents had done in
the past, with one in five visiting such a venue at least once.
In comparison, very few respondents had ever worked there
– only 1.6%, which is lower than the proportion who have
charged for sex.
