OnePlus 6 Event:
Let’s turn this into a
bit of an op-ed piece for
a second – I’m no fan of
notches. I like my bezels
uniform and symmet-
rical. Despite my gripe
with some aspects of the
flagship’s appearance,
OnePlus has put together
a respectable phone on
paper with a price tag that
yet again undercuts most
competition. If it ain’t
broke don’t try to fix it.
What did we miss?
T
he light blinded
me as I climbed
out of my cave.
For many, time
essentially stopped around
March and didn’t restart
until their very last exam.
I was one of those people,
and until a few hours ago
I was convinced that noth-
ing happened in the world
of tech for the past three
months.
Holy crap was I
wrong....
And so were you,
probably. Here’s an
update on everything
you’ve missed if you’ve
just emerged from the
darkest, gloomiest corners
of the library.
In complete antithe-
sis to all the math and
thinking that’s behind us
we’re going to do this in
no particular order at all.
in Bluetooth adoption and
helps stifle any (righteous,
for now but not for much
longer I hope) criticism
that customers shouldn’t
have to pick between an
obsolete solution (the
jack) and a subpar one
(Bluetooth). Thankfully,
Oneplus kept the head-
phone jack too.
Apple’s WWDC:
Well, it’s Apple we’re
talking about, so let me
guess – they rendered a
few old iPhones obsolete,
added another camera on
the back of the iPhone 8S,
and introduced a couple
more bugs into High
Sierra?
All wrong – Apple
surprised everyone by
announcing iOS 12 would
not only be supported by
all the iPhones featuring
iOS 11, but also aim to
fix the countless bugs
that turn your phone into
a paperweight should it
try to display the wrong
character.
We didn’t see the in-
troduction of any iPhones
or MacBooks at the
conference. Instead, Tim
Cook and co. announced
MacOS Mojave which
brings a true dark mode
but, more importantly, a
complete revolution in
how you use your desktop.
through thousands of
unwanted photos that
much more fun.
If you ask me, I’m
happy with the direction
this year’s WWDC has
taken. Both Apple’s
mobile and desktop OS
need not new features but
rather improvements in
usability and the ironing
out of bugs. Microsoft,
watch and learn.
E3???:
Oh right, E3 happened!
Among the announce-
ments was Naughty Dog’s
guarantee that many more
tears will be shed by
console gamers this year
– The Last of Us Part II is
upon us.
Bethesda’s trailer for
“Skyrim Very Special
Edition” featuring a satiri-
cal introduction of Skyrim
to a new platform –
Amazon’s Alexa. Poking
fun at their inclination
to try earn money off the
Skyrim brand in any way
possible, the protagonist
in the trailer plays a
variation of Dungeons
and Dragons with his
Amazon Echo. I could
complain about Bethesda
for being, for the lack of a
better term, woke, but I’m
really just happy to see
Keegan-Michael Key in a
skit again.

“Apple is

in usability,

An entire three months of tech summarised in under a minute of speed-reading.

their phone was a pair of
Bluetooth earbuds for just

this as any competition

If you’re anything like
me, you treat your desktop
the way you would a serial
killer in your room – keep
your distance, throw stuff
at it, and most importantly
don’t make any direct eye
contact. With Mojave, a
feature known as sets will
attempt to organize your
desktop by file type while
a new viewing mode for
finder will make scrolling
“TL;DR:
Evolution is
the name of
the game, not
revolution.”
Of course, within the
past three months, count-
less startups have brought
about their innovations
and hundreds of other
companies unveiled their
exciting products like
Asus’ laptop with a screen
replacing the touchpad.
Keeping tabs on the
aforementioned trifecta of
events should, however,
spare you for some em-
barrassing ignorance in
the next few days.
