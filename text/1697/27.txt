PLEASE DON’T TALK TO ME ABOUT ART…

250th
Summer Exhibition.
N
ow open for
its 250th
con-
secutive year,
the Summer
Exhibition at the Royal
Academy of Arts still fills
its walls in the Salon-style
of the late 18th
century.
Each room is crammed
from floor-to-ceiling with
art – a smörgåsbord of
sizes, styles, and materi-
als. Walking from room
to room feels like falling
down a rabbit hole.
I had almost adjusted
to the neon blue walls of
the entrance room when
a painting of a baby bird
appeared in front of me,
demanding in block
letters: “PLEASE DON’T
TALK TO ME ABOUT
ART”. Nearby, a couple
debated whether the price
of a painting was fair.
The man turned to the
woman and said in a stage
whisper, “If you’d bought
one of her paintings a
decade ago, you could’ve
had it for only five
thousand pounds.” She
quickly replied, “Well,
you might be able to say
that about anyone here ten
years from now!”
The exhibition always
features several famous
and up-and-coming artists
from the UK and abroad,
but the joy of the show
is its open submission
process. Any artist can
submit work, and more
than 4,000 pieces are
chosen for the final round
of decisions. Curators
give no special treatment
to artists with name
recognition or gallery
representation. The result
is a show that crowds
the gallery walls like a
tube station during bank
holiday: bustling, hot,
colourful, breathtaking.
Deeper into the exhibi-
tion, I found a small square
portrait of a dog posing
by Vermeer’s Girl with
a Pearl Earring. Stuck
on the wall next to it was
an orange dot sticker that
meant it had been sold.
Nearly every piece in the
exhibition – from the most
expensive sculpture to the
cheapest print – is for sale.
Those interested can buy
an official Summer Exhi-
bition List of Works for
reference (“only £3.50,
over by the reception
desk”). The booklet is
over 200 pages long and
contains only the name,
artist, material, and price
of each work.
“It’s show that
crowds the
gallery walls
like a tube
station during
bank holiday:

“The show is

of the
contemporary
art world’s
easily
packable,
sellable side”
On opening day, more
than half of the exhibi-
tion’s 1,351 works showed
off at least one dot. The
Royal Academy invites
buyers from past years
to preview the exhibition
in the weeks leading up
to the grand opening, so
a concentrated burst of
serious buying happens
during this exclusive
“shopping period”. When
a piece can be produced
and sold in multiples – like
prints and photographs
– more than one dot can
be put up. Tucked away
in a corner of a top floor
gallery hung a framed US
dollar bill with the word
“TRASH” printed on it in
violent orange. It already
had 83 dots.
For a show whose
subtitle is ‘Art Made
Now’, the RA’s Summer
Exhibition showcases sur-
prisingly few new media
and digital works. With
the exception of a handful
of videos and a moderate
selection of sculptures and
architectural models, most
of the work on display is
two-dimensional – paint-
ings, prints, photographs,
drawings, mixed media.
Maybe the subtitle should
read ‘For Sale: Art Made
Now’. Even so, the show
feels fresh and exciting –

porary art world’s easily
packable, transportable,
sellable side.
references, inventions,
jokes, egos, beauty, and
quiet moments. A lonely
twig looks down from just
below the ceiling. A large
flattened bust of the Queen
smiles warmly. The whole
thing seems like a mess.
Yet it talks to itself.
A print of a mountain in
one of the later galleries
reminded me of a tiny
painting of a house I
had seen high up in the
entrance room. Retracing
my steps through several
galleries, I noticed more
pieces – sculptures, pho-
tographs, a video – that
had a family resemblance.
Colours call to colours
across galleries. A robin’s
egg blue sounds out first
in paint, then echoes back
in ink and cloth and metal
from four different rooms.
I wandered back (for
the third? The fourth
time?) through a gallery
filled with to-scale archi-
tectural models. Each was
delicately constructed,
with tiny human figures
frozen inside. Around
them, giants drifted by:
gallery visitors moving
from room to room. I
thought of the bustle
outside, of Oxford Street
and Piccadilly Circus.
How many people were
walking through London
right then? I imagined
the city shrunken down
to the size of a dollhouse.
Tiny people walk through
each carefully constructed
model building and some
of them look up in rooms
filled with microscopic
paintings. I suddenly
zoomed back to reality
as a woman popped out
of a tunnel built into
the display in front of
me. “Wow”, she said
breathlessly. “Welcome to
wonderland!”

Lessons in Love and Violence: a big name production
fails to deliver
George Benjamin’s conduction of his new opera on King Edward II hits the correct notes musically and presents a
stellar cast, but the plot leaves a sense of disappointment at what could have been a brilliant spectacle.
W
hy is it so
hard to
write about
o p e r a s ?
The Royal Opera House’s
Lessons of Love and
Violence left me with the
feeling there was some-
thing brilliant going on.
You could feel it in the
sudden pauses, changes of
motion, sharp minors, and
dark bursts of music. And
strangely, an odd feeling
still haunts me.
The plot is all there.
You have a King who has
a lover, a wife who still
loves and wants to rescue
him, commoners who
starve and die, and an
adviser who can separate
love and politics. Love
and politics – an intense
conflict between the two
different concepts that
rarely enter into our lives,
but fight it out in people
who owe us guidance.
The King – referred to
as only this throughout
the show – falls in love
with Gaveston, one of
the nobles he praises and
provides for, even at the
expense of his people.
This reckless behaviour
worries advisor Mortimer,
who advises him to stop
this relationship, and ends
up exiled from the palace
– it’s a decision which sets
a train of consequences,
ending up tearing his
family apart. A traditional
“The opera
starts in a
traditional
manner, but
is let down
thanks to a
poor libretto”
“The opera
is undone by
trying to keep
the best of
both worlds:
the modern
and the
classical”
startforausualoperaseria,
if it were not for the poor
libretto following this call
to action. This is not to
blame the composer, or
actors’ performances; in
opera, music should be a
tool to enhance the specta-
cle, transforming a regular
play into a message that
sinks in and leaves us with
good memories long after
leaving the theatre. Above
all, it should serve the
play, but the play should
not rely on it to keep the
show alive.
In an attempt to
modernise the old tale of
Edward II, who died from
love and failed miserably
in his role as monarch, the
adaptation fell short and
delivered a classic tale in a
confusing way. A conflict
of modern staging and
historical plotting clashes
in an unpleasant way for
the viewer. The reality of
the scenes simply do not
match the main themes
approached. This clash
is more distinctly seen in
the second scene when
Mortimer brings poor
commoners to the palace
to confront the queen,
Isabel, with the problems
they face. This is one of
my favourite scenes from
the play, and yet it still
feels like something is
off with the plot, which
forgot to modernise the
characters’ dilemmas to
the modern staging.
In addition to this, the
script lacks the essential
flow in verse that is sorely
needed in a play of this
expense and production.
This is not entirely to
blame to the writer alone,
but more generally, to the
communication between
composition and lyrics.
Not everything is a
disappointment. The
music underlying the play
shows moments of hidden
brilliance, with mystical
moments conducted with
no powerful notes or usual
use of noise and easy
emotional chords.
The performances
should be acknowledged
too, with a brilliant turn
from Barbara Hannigan as
Isabel, who made herself
heard in the vast space,
displaying her soprano
nuances. Peter Hoare,
as Mortimer, and Gyula
Orendt, as Gaveston, had
voices which matched
their perfectionist stage
performances, with their
smooth and distinctive
voices able to occupy
physical space.
In the end, Lessons
in Love and Violence
was undone by a terrible
problem when adapting
old pieces into modern
styles: a self-absorbed
ambition to keep the best
of both worlds, without
changing anything that
actually brings something
new. An old story, with
a new adaptation, but
still same core. A sort of
intellectual effort to keep
the old art alive with new
pieces that will inevita-
bly fail every time they
ignore the need to make
real changes in what is
being presented. History
lectures and background
story should not be an
exercisefortheviewer,but
something that everyone
is able to understand.
Hard-to-grasp dialogue,
confusing topics, and
undelivered lessons result
in an unfinished product
from the artists, not to be
confused with elevated
culture.
With all that said, I do
not think operas fail the
average arts-enthusiast.
They can be enjoyable
and funny, with phi-
lanthropists financing
productions ensuring the
art is continually elevated
regardless of cultural
shifts. Lessons in Love
and Violence missed a
bigger point than that. It
failed to create a package
of musical melody and
theatrical drama that line
up in only the best master-
pieced of human talent.
