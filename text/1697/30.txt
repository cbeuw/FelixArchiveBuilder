The Iliac Crest – An unsettling tale of disappearance
and mystery
This surreal novel from Mexican author Cristina Rivera Garza explores the nature of boundaries, in a haunted tale
that sticks in the imagination.
I
n literature, disap-
pearance tends to be
a primarily active
phenomenon, with
individuals making the
choice to leave their
family and friends behind.
While it is not necessarily
a consensual act – ‘dis-
appear’ implies people
are left behind, who are
often searching for the
missing individual – the
person who disappears
generally does so of their
own accord; from Gillian
Flynn’s Gone Girl through
to Alice Munro’s brilliant
trio of short stories in
her Runaway collection,
literature is peppered with
these tales of voluntary
flight.
But then there is the
phenomenon of disap-
pearance as a passive
phenomenon, which takes
on a greater sense of
darkness: the individual
does not ‘disappear’, but
rather they ‘are disap-
peared’. Implicit within
this act is the notion of
violence, of power, of
horror. Mexican author
Cristina Rivera Garza
expertly mines this deep
seam of the uncanny in
her short novel The Iliac
Crest, first published in
Spanish in 2002, and now
arriving in English with
a translation by Sarah
Booker. Drawing on
the boundaries between
existence and absence,
gender lines, and the
fluid nature of borders,
Rivera Garza has weaved
a darkly-unsettling tale,
which – though short –
leaves a lasting impact on
the reader.
“Rivera Garza
has weaved
a darkly-
unsettling tale,
which leaves a
lasting impact
on the reader”
“Not only the
terrain of the
earth, but
the terrain
of the body
also proves
malleable”
The book centres on an
unnamed narrator, living
in a home by the sea, who
works at a hospital for the
dying, which he describes
as “nothing more than
a cemetery with open
tombs.” One rainy night
he receives a visit from
two women: one is a
figure from his past, struck
down by a fever, while the
other is Mexican author
Amparo Dávilla, known
for her gothic works which
dwell on the fantastic and
sinister. This Dávilla has
been ‘disappeared’ – the
real-life Dávilla is alive
and well – which Rivera
Garza describes as a form
of physical contagion
sweeping the unnamed
country: “mechanisms
triggering the disease vary
quite a bit – a greater or
lesser degree of violence,
more or less isolation, a
little or a lot of silence –
but the common element
among all of them is
contact.”
Thisideaofbeingdisap-
peared has a long history,
particularly in Latin and
Southern America, where
regimes like Pinochet’s
would regularly liquidate
political opponents.
While at the time of
writing Rivera Garza was
undoubtedly referencing
the widely-publicised
femicides occurring in
Ciudad Juárez, today they
evoke most strongly inci-
dents like the 2014 Iguala
mass kidnapping, during
which 43 students were
disappeared.
The disappeared
Dávilla nurses the other
woman back to health, and
the two begin conspiring
together in an unknown
language, leaving the
narrator helpless – “I
could do nothing before
their language. I could not
infiltrate it.” They ask him
to search the hospital’s
records for a mysterious
patient from the past,
which could help them
identify a lost manuscript
of Dávilla’s.
Rivera Garza evokes
a sense of Kafkaesque
nightmare in the hospital
sequences, while also
reminding me of the cool,
clear horror of Shirley
Jackson’s best work.
What sets Rivera
Garza’s novel apart from
other books which deal
with similar moods of
isolation and fear is the
way she explores the
idea of boundaries. The
book takes place in an
uncertain geography –
references are made to a
‘North City’ and a ‘South
City’, between which
the hospital seems to be
located, abutting a wide
open sea. The narrator
describes it as “the end of
the world…this threshold
where one state ended
and the next was unable
to begin.” The terrain of
the earth is not the only
uncertain aspect; the
terrain of the body, and
of gender, also proves to
be malleable, with Rivera
Garza exploring ambigu-
ities in identity skillfully,
although certain linguistic
differences between
Spanish and English
limit this exploration
somewhat. Those who
are disappeared live “with
one foot in the grave and
the other on terrain that
held only a remote resem-
blance to life”, existing
in some kind of ethereal
plane.
Rivera Garza also
powerfully writes about
the force language, and its
creation, can have. Faced
have the means to describe
their own experiences on
this earth.” The word, for
Rivera Garza, is both a
liberation and a form of
power, which can both lift
up and oppress.
Late in the novel,
the narrator speaks of
how staff at the hospital
describe dying individuals
as ‘patients’: “We dealt
with people to whom we
hadn’t yet found a suffi-
ciently technical or neutral
way to describe, without
the weight of conscience,
the underlying truth about
our position: we were
not doctors, but more or
less efficient guardians
of death.” This sense of
horror lurking behind
language infiltrates The
Iliac Crest; it pervades
deep into the bones of
Rivera Garza’s words,
settling deep into the very
marrow of the novel.
