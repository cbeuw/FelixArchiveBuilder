First new stereoisomer type in 50 years, claim chemists
C
hemists at
both Shanghai
University and
the University of
Sydney have announced
the discovery of the first
new kind of molecular
stereoisomer in half a
century. For those who
have never heard of this
term, stereoisomers are
molecules that share the
same molecular formula
(i.e. contain the same
number of atoms of each
element) as well as bond
connections between
species, but have different
arrangements in the 3-D
space. Previous known
stereoisomers include
enantiomers, which are
pairs of molecules that
are non superimposable
mirror images of each
other (if you have trouble
imagining this, think of
your right and left hand;
they are identical, but
there is no physical way
to superimpose them in
a way that makes both
of them identical to each
other).
a porphyrin macrocyclic
ring – a circular, rigid
structure formed by sub-
units of nitrogen, carbon
and hydrogen known as
pyrroles and also found in
haemoglobin – the bond
angle inversion caused
by the bending of a trio
of atoms in the molecule
(a boron-oxygen-boron
bridge) is fixed in space,
as rotation is blocked by
the ring itself. This would
not happen if the molecule
was outside the macrocy-
cle, as the rotation of the
bonds would produce a
molecule that would be
identical to its starting
configuration.
The new family of ste-
reoisomers has tentatively
been named as Akampti-
somers, taking its name
from ákamptos, the Greek
term for ‘inflexible’.
The two possible isomer
forms corresponding to
the opposite orientations
of the bond angle have
been baptized as ‘parvo’
and ‘amplo’, after the
Latin words for small and
large, respectively. Ac-
cording to the scientists
who made this finding,
the new group of isomers
have potential to be useful
in several fields such as
medicinal chemistry, as
they could be essential for
the synthesis and charac-
terization of the active
principles of future drugs.
Other hypothetical appli-
cations of akamptisomers
include their potential use
in molecular computers.
For these devices to work,
it is essential that the mol-
ecules used can change
between two different
configurations. However,
the chemists involved in
the discovery admitted
that, while promising, it is
very unlikely that akamp-
toisomers will be soon
making an appearance in
commercially available
molecular computers, as
more research is needed
regarding the stability and
nature of this new family
of isomers.

When it is surrounded by
Imperial CDT Science festival: Science and Ethics
T
he synergy be-
tween Science
and Ethics is
pervasive in our
society. Scientific ad-
vances and technological
developments are shaping
the future of our life,
and society as a whole.
Imperial will be holding
their annual CDT Science
Festival, which this year
aims to explore and
understand how scientific
research integrates with
ethical values by analys-
ing emerging frontiers,
their social impacts, and
possible implications.
We are glad to introduce
students, researchers, and
professionals from other
fields to a variety of de-
bated topics with valuable
insights from a pool of
experts in the field. The
discussions will provide
a stimulating ground to
address the curiosity and
common concerns of the
audience – since science
and ethics are two faces of
the same coin.
To better connect the
audience with experts, a
series of talks on sustain-
able innovation, climate
science, artificial intelli-
gence, genome editing,
and quantum technologies
will take place.
Would future advances
in genome editing consti-
tute the ultimate frontier
for personalised health-
care? Could surgical inter-
ventions be fully replaced
by a new generation of
genetic pharmaceuticals,
without compromising
our identity as species?
How will we make
complex decisions in
more general critical
scenarios with (un)clear
conflicting goals? How
can we possibly leverage
technology whilst pre-
serving our values? The
questions are endless …
At the CDT Science
Festival, we want to offer
the exciting opportunity
to answer these open
questions, understand
the related implications,
and argue about possible
side-effects each research
area projects into our own
lives.
Talks and discussions
will be accompanied by
Pandemic, an interactive
movie that allows visitors
from the audience to expe-
rience a series of real-life
ethical case questions.
Students and young
researchers are invited
to submit posters for
the one-day pop-up
‘Sustainable Innovation
Exhibition’, to showcase
the ethical implications of
their scientific research.
Submissions are now
open at http://www.cdtfes-
tival.co.uk/.
A further competition
will award the best
poster addressing the
following questions:
what are the implications
of our research? What
are the values involved
in the decision-making
process? How can we
steer our research and
developments towards
respecting and enhancing
common values? How
can we reduce disparity?
And how can we improve
justice, welfare, and
equality in our society?
The proposed posters
should consider the
impact of current innova-
tions, and should suggest
a constructive scientific
progress sustainable
for society. Rather than
focusing on the techni-
cal and technological
advance per se, we would
emphasise the advantages
and possible downsides
regarding their use in
scenarios with conflicting
goals.

July 9th
2018, for the CDT
Science Festival and the
associated exhibitions at:

We look forward to
welcoming you!

Cancer and the immune system – friend or foe?
W
hy is cancer
so difficult
to beat,
you might
be wondering. The main
problem with cancer is
that it arises from our
own cells. We are all
unique and special, but
so are our tumors, which
makes it difficult to deal
with them at a population
level. Unfortunately, the
same drug might not have
the same effect on two
different people, even
though they might have
the same kind of cancer.
As we wait for personal-
ised medicine to develop
in the future, scientists
are currently trying to
enhance our natural and
already personalised
defence mechanisms: our
immune system.
In general, people asso-
ciate the immune system
with the body’s mecha-
nism of defense against
viral, fungal, and bacterial
infections. But this is not
all it does – it also fights
back against cancer. There
is plenty of evidence
showing how important a
role the immune system
plays in keeping cancer at
bay. People with immuno-
deficiencies, for example,
are known to be more
prone to develop tumors.
some of the cells of the
immune system to their
advantage, providing
them with more glucose
(food) and oxygen to fa-
cilitate their growth.Apart
from this comfort, cancer
cells become invisible
and thus protected from
the rest of the immune
system, which would
otherwise eliminate them.
More specifically, there
are two families of cells
belonging to the immune
system that generally
become cancer friendly:
cancer associated-mac-
rophages and regulatory
T cells.
Cancer cells can
therefore become reliant
on these particular cell
families for their survival.
And so, researchers
are currently working
on ways to exploit this
weakness. Individual dis-
ruption of the cancer-as-
sociated macrophages or
the regulatory T cells has
so far failed to provide
any satisfactory results,
the reason being that upon
dysfunction in one of
these cell families there
is a tendency for the other
to increase in terms of
number and functionality.
There seems, in other
words, to be a compen-
satory effect. With this
in mind, researchers at
the Babraham Institute
employed a dual strategy
in which they managed to
disrupt both cell families
simultaneously. In their
recent publication, they
show that in a colon
cancer model in mice this
treatment promotes the
immune system rejection
of the cancer. By the end
of the study half of the
mice were completely
tumor free. Although
much more research needs
to be done, the inhibitor of
the T regulatory cells they
used is already approved
as a treatment for some
cancers, so this new
strategy could potentially
be easily translated into
the clinic.
Considering how
complex cancer is as a
disease, boosting our own
immune system to battle
it is a strategy that might
serve to overcome current
limitations when the med-
ications we do have stop
working.

“Strikingly,
some cancers
have been
shown to
create a micro-
environment,
using the
immune
system to their
advantage”
So, why does cancer
emerge in a person with a
healthy immune system?
Cancer is the result of the
uncontrolled growth of as
little as one of our own
cells. Since these cells
replicate quite fast, they
often acquire mutations
that can make them resist-
ant to current medication
or even the detection of
the immune system itself.
More strikingly, some
cancers have been shown
to create a microenviron-
ment in which they use
