The times, they are a-changin’: a precarious balance
of alienation and progression
This article started life as a thinkpiece. It then became a listicle, before reverting back to thinkpiece. Whatever
form it now takes, it’s my final article of the year so you’d better bloody enjoy it.

T
he recent re-
lease of Arctic
M o n k e y s ’
Tranquillity Base
Hotel & Casino divided
fans. A far cry from the
angst-laden and frenetic
rock of the noughties,
TBH&C brought with it a
toned-down, lounge vibe,
filled with nuances and
subtleties rather foreign
to their previously brash
and unapologetically
frank discography. While
many embraced their new
sound, a not insignificant
subset heralded the
swerve as a betrayal of
their original fanbase.
Despite the widespread
uproar, this change of
musical direction pales
in comparison to some
of those taken by crucial
artists throughout history.
In each, a bold risk was
taken – potentially alienat-
ing the very people whose
support enabled them to
take the leap in the first
place. Inevitably, many
flopped. Others, however,
changed the musical land-
scape for good.
Dylan goes electric
In the early sixties, Bob
Dylan was a figurehead of
folk. Only acoustic guitar
and harmonica accompa-
nied his carefully crafted
narratives and protest
songs. He was pointed and
political, often labelled
the “spokesman of a gen-
eration”. Not content to
be confined to this niche,
however, Dylan left fans
aghast when his March
1965 album Bringing It
All Back Home included
a side of songs, simulta-
neously the densest and
shallowest of his canon,
backed by an electric
band. A few months later
at Newport folk festival,
he arrived on stage
leather-clad and Strato-
caster-adorned, and, with
the snap of a snare, im-
mediately launched into
new hit ‘Like A Rolling
Stone’. “How does it
feel?!” he sneered over
the boos and jeers, with
a swagger before unseen.
It may have turned away
a generation, but it also
cemented his position in
music history: he was a
rockstar.
If ya say so, computer
If OK Computer chron-
icles humanity’s struggle
against machines, Kid
A prophecies a dystopia
within which the robots
won. With one side of the
Atlantic launching grunge
and the other championing
Britpop, the Radiohead of
the mid-nineties was inev-
itably one of guitar driven
belters and ballads. Kid A
was a landmark of change.
“One of
the most
acclaimed rock
bands of the
era releasing a
fully electronic
album
certainly
shook things
up a bit”
A full three years on from
their previous release, it
ushered in the new mil-
lennium with synthesisers
and arpeggiators. Hooks
were sparse, soundscapes
bleak, and not a guitar in
sight. Nowadays it doesn’t
seem all that revolution-
ary – they kinda made
innovation and surprise
their thing, and it’s very
easy to retrospectively say
it was an obvious move –
but back in 2000, one of
the most acclaimed rock
bands of the era releasing
a fully electronic album
certainly shook things up
a bit. Swathes of adoring
fans renounced them, but
it resonated with many
more, and the vibrations
are still felt to this day.
The Chameleon King
As anybody who’s
been keeping up with
Felix Music over the past
year will know, I can
rarely go a full article
without mentioning one
Mr. David Robert Jones.
But here (for once) it’s
not without good reason.
Springing from whimsi-
cal psychedelic folk in
the late sixties, Bowie
hit the seventies like a
riff-laden, skin-suited,
glam-rock train, which
chugged away for half
a glitter-filled decade.
The difference at this
juncture, however, is that
Bowie didn’t alienate his
fanbase. He didn’t really
have one to alienate. Not
at this point at least.
By the end of 1969,
he’d been dismissed as
something of a one-hit
wonder, his sole outing
chiefly thanks to the
BBC’s inclusion of ‘Space
Oddity’ in their coverage
of the moon landing. He
later found his break as
the mullet-sporting Ziggy
Stardust, and the rest is
history. Except it’s not.
The persona of Ziggy
was killed onstage in
1973, and by ’75 Bowie
had dropped glam rock
altogether, switching to
the blue-eyed soul sound
of Young Americans. This
was a drastic sidestep
not only because of the
change of timbre but also
as it made him one of the
first English pop artists to
embrace a style that had
until then largely resided
within black America.
Whether appropriative or
appreciative is a different
argument, but either way
fans and critics were left
torn and confused.
It wasn’t to last though.
His next album, Station
to Station, saw him fuse
funk with krautrock as the
slicked-back, cocaine-ad-
dled Thin White Duke.
From there he began to
experiment with art rock,
electronic and ambient
music, as part of his Berlin
Trilogy with longtime
friend and collaborator
Brian Eno.
I won’t bore you with
all the details of his sub-
sequent works, but let it
suffice to say he hopped
into new-romanticism,
flirted with disco, sported
some chart success (his
‘Phil Collins Years’), tried
his hand at world music,
formed a boyband, hit up
industrial, drum n bass,
jazz, and much, much
more. With each twist,
some fans were lost and
some gained; the net result
wasn’t always positive.
I think to an extent
every artist is restless.
No one wants to define
or be defined by a sole
look, genre, or rhetoric.
But few illustrated that
irrepressible agitation and
hunger for change better
than David Bowie.

Kids See Ghosts is a return to form for Kanye West
Only a week after the release of Ye, Kanye is back, this time teaming up with Kid Cudi as Kids See Ghosts. While the
previous album felt rushed, this newest output is a refined and thoughtful masterpiece.
T
his self-titled
release marks the
first collaboration
project from hip
hop’s biggest contempo-
rary influencers, Kid Cudi
and KanyeWest, who have
dubbed themselves Kids
See Ghosts. This moniker
and album title, as well
as the album art, which
was the work of Takashi
Murakami (who has pre-
viously worked with Ye
on Graduation) is perfect
for this project. Indeed,
they truly encapsulate
what we get from the
album – something sur-
real, colourful, sonically
captivating, psychedelic,
child-like, magical; bitter-
sweet in places and eerie
in others.
We are kept in this crazy
Super Smash Bros. meets
Attack on Titan world
throughout the project
with vocal and production
moments that range from
unavoidably explicit
to subtle yet effective.
Kanye delivers expressive
machine gun imita-
tions complimented by
powerful drum pounding
on ‘Feel The Love’. Cudi
delivers spiritual, delicate
wailing on ‘Reborn’ (I
should add, the signature
Cudder moan is more pal-
atable on this album than
it has been in years). The
pair deliver, with the help
of Ty Dolla Sign, gigantic
and layered evaporating
cries of “I feel freeee” on
the aptly titled ‘Freeee
(Ghost Town, Pt. 2)’. The
production delivers easy
to miss whizzing whistles
and triumphant screams
on ‘Fire’ and similarly
subtle but pretty, high
pitched string shivers on
‘Kids See Ghosts’. We lit-
erally hear a childish evil
cackle mid-way through
‘4th
Dimension’. It is
obvious that a lot of effort
was put into maintaining
the aesthetic of the album
and it has certainly paid
off.
In 2016, Kid Cudi and
Kanye both went through
a low point with their
mental health, with Kid
Cudi checking himself
into rehab on account of
depression and suicidal
urges (as explained in
the emotional statement
he released at the time)
and Kanye having to
bring his Saint Pablo tour
to an early close when
he was hospitalised for
psychosis. Mental health
has always been a very
prominent theme in Kid
Cudi’s music, and Kanye’s
albums from 808s and
Heartbreaks onward have
each had a fair deal to say
on the matter. Ye, released
only a week before this
one, honed in on that
theme. However, where
that album explored his
mental health condition in
a fairly rushed and often
limited manner, Kids See
Ghosts for the most part
provides a more complete,
focused and sincere
account, coming closer to
the standard set by Cudi’s
Man on the Moon. The
project is nevertheless
decidedly triumphant and
optimistic when exploring
such issues which is clear
from the onset with Cudi’s
powerful and reverberat-
ing exclamation of “I can
still feel the love” on ‘Feel
The Love’ which the song
builds around. Indeed,
while it is probably Kanye
who steered this project
to stylistic and aesthetic
excellence, it is Cudi
who keeps the break-
down-conquering theme
of the project potent and
effective, and in this way
the pair complement one
another nicely. That is to
say, where Kanye’s bars
and delivery are undenia-
bly flashier and more im-
pressive than Cudi’s, Cudi
generally delivers the
more emotive moments
with lines such as “I guess
I’m just sick of running
/ All this time searching
hard for something / I can
hear the angels coming”.
True, it is difficult
not to wish for both the
high-quality bars and
thematic focus from both
halves of Kids See Ghosts,
just to make the album
slightly more coherent.
Even the first verse on
the album, a Pusha T
feature, though fiery and
braggadocious, doesn’t
really have much to do
with Cudi “feel(ing) the
love”. Similarly, Mos
Def’s spoken-word type
thing at the end of ‘Kids
See Ghosts’ about “civi-
lization without society”
(still not quite sure what
that means) seems fairly
random. However, when
all the aspects of this
album come together, it
makes for near flawless
songs. ‘4th
Dimension’
is one of these – a 30s
Christmas song is sampled
ingeniously as Kanye
delivers a crude ‘Hell Of
A Life’-style verse about
a chaotic hook up which
he compares to a “new
dimension”. Cudi’s verse
is similarly dark and sug-
gestive with a confident
delivery but he brings his
verse back down to earth
with the lines “Tell the
cougar get up off me, no,
my soul ain’t for sale / All
the evils in the world, they
keeping on me for real”.
‘Reborn’ is a beautiful
ballad of progression and
self-improvement, my fa-
vourite song of the album.
Cudi sings a heartfelt
chorus of “I’m so – I’m
so reborn, I’m movin’
forward… /Ain’t no stress
on me Lord, I’m movin’
forward” over a calming,
angelic beat comprising
of simple keys, progres-
sive drums, glimmering
synths, and the aforemen-
tioned remedial moans.
Both Kanye and Kid Cudi
deliver their most personal
and intimate verses of
the album. “I was off the
meds, I was called insane
/ What a awesome thing,
engulfed in shame / I want
all the rain, I want all the
pain” Kanye raps, laying
himself bare and admit-
ting that the pain in his
life has become numbing
to the point of addictive
(a sentiment particularly
echoed on both parts of
‘Ghost Town’). Cudi’s
verse is just as emotional,
though he makes sure
to remind us “peace is
something that starts with
me”. The song ends with
a gorgeous beat switch up
as the chorus comes back
in over soothing synths
and close drums.
It would be amiss for
me not to mention ‘Cudi
Montage’, the last track on
the album. A Kurt Cobain
sample and a fast-paced
Cudi flow guides the track
forward as the beat builds
for a grand chorus. The
beat then strips back down
to the sample for what
is surely Kanye’s most
conscious verse in a very
long time. He raps about
the cycle of violence seen
in impoverished neigh-
bourhoods in America
and the routine loss of
men to imprisonment
in such environments. I
wonder what his buddy
Trump thinks. The song
ends with a majestic outro
as Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi
and Kanye’s vocals blend
together. “Lord shine your
light on me, save me,
please” Kanye implores.
I do hope Kid Cudi and
Kanye West are “saved”
from their spiritual and
mental suffering. One
thing that clearly needs
no saving though is their
ability to make music.
Here’s to hoping Kids See
Ghosts is not a one-time
stint.
