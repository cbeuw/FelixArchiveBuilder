The cinema of Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda
Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or last month for his drama Shoplifters – it’s a long-overdue recognition for
the spiritual successor of Yasujiro Ozu.

Editor-in-Chief
T
his year’s Cannes
Film Festival,
which closed
last month, saw a
timely focus on the issues
of sexual harassment that
have dominated the film
industry press over the
last year. The discussion
reached a shocking
conclusion when actor
Asia Argento made a
speech during the closing
ceremony, accusing dis-
graced producer Harvey
Weinstein of raping her
at the festival back in
1997, when she was 21
years old. Argento called
the festival his ‘hunting
ground’. Elsewhere,
president of the jury
Cate Blanchett – who is
one of only four female
presidents in the last 20
years – led 82 women
in a protest up the set of
red carpeted stairs. The
number represented the
number of films made by
women that had entered
the festival during its 70
year history, compared to
1,645 made by men over
the same time period.
Amid all these
shocks, however, there
was another surprise
that had a happier tone:
Shoplifters, the 13th
film
from Japanese director
Hirokazu Kore-eda, took
home the Palme d’Or,
marking the culmination
of a twenty year-long
career in which Kore-eda
has delivered some of the
best-crafted dramas of
modern cinema.
Beginning his career
in television, Kore-eda
worked as an assistant
director for TV docu-
mentaries, before making
the switch to film with a
series of documentaries
in the early 1990s. 1995
saw the release of his first
feature film, Maborosi,
which centred around a
widow trying to make
sense of the death of her
husband, who was hit by
a train while out walking
by the tracks. The late
Roger Ebert gave the film
his highest rating, saying
“There isn’t a shot in the
movie that’s not graceful
and pleasing.”
Kore-eda’s real
breakthrough came in
2004, with the release of
Nobody Knows. Taking
inspiration from the 1988
Sugamo child abandon-
ment case, in which a
media storm was created
when a group of children
were found living in a
Tokyo apartment after
being abandoned by
their mother nine months
earlier, Nobody Knows
centres around four
children who are left to
fend for themselves. Lead
actor Yuya Yagira became
the youngest winner of
the Cannes Best Actor
Prize, for his portrayal
of Akira, the eldest child
who becomes the de facto
head of the family.
From then on, Kore-eda
released a film every
couple of years, often
to critical acclaim. Film
critics have often pointed
out the debt he owes to
Yasujiro Ozu, one of the
greatest film directors
of the twentieth century.
Like Ozu, Kore-eda’s
films often centre around
the theme of the family,
or of relationships, gently
exploring how we relate
to others in the world
around us; that push-pull
of intimacy and emotion
that comes with living
a life closely meshed
with others. Kore-eda’s
camerawork also conveys
a similar sense of stillness
as Ozu; often filming from
lower angles, Kore-eda
will meticulously frame
his shots, often inter-
spersing them with what
became known in Ozu’s
work as ‘pillow shots’ –
short clips of the world
around the characters,
identifying a sense of time
and place.
Since 2011, with
the release of I Wish,
Kore-eda has become
more and more well-
known to Western cine-
ma-going audiences. Both
I Wish and the follow-up
Like Father Like Son
deal with the theme of
the family, probing at our
most basic relationships.
Taking place over a
single year, Our Little
Sister is a film about the
gentle rhythms of life:
we follow the sisters as
they form a close bond,
the seasons changing
from winter to spring
to summer; and as the
seasons change, the
food does too. Our Little
Sister is a film in which
cuisine plays a central
part, bringing people
together and reflecting the
changing world around us
– from making plum wine
at the height of summer,
to bonding over whitebait
on toast. It’s a work that
revels in the magic of the
minutiae of everyday life.
Shoplifters screened at
Cannes to critical acclaim,
with Peter Bradshaw of
The Guardian calling it “a
movie made up of delicate
brushstrokes: details,
moments, looks and
smiles.” With any luck, it
will be out in UK cinemas
later this year, providing
us with another dose of
humanistic cinema from
the Japanese master.
There has never been a
better time to explore
Kore-eda’s extensive back
catalogue, and discover
his magic for yourself.
The cast of Our Little Sister // Sony Pictures Classics
Shoplifters has been picked up by Magnolia Pictures for its release // Cannes Film Festi-
val
“Kore-eda’s
dramas
explore the
push-pull of
intimacy and
emotion”
It is his 2015 film, Our
Little Sister, however,
which remains by far my
favourite Kore-eda film.
It’s one of those films
that envelops you in a
warm hug, one where
you leave the cinema
feeling a bit lighter and
brighter about the world.
Based off a manga series,
Our Little Sister tells the
story of three grown-up
sisters, Sachi, Yoshino,
and Chika, who live in
Kamakura, a small city
by the cost. Following the
death of their father, from
whom they are estranged,
their half-sister Suzu
from their father’s second
marriage comes to live
with them, shaking up
their everyday routine.
