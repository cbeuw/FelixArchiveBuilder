T
he number of
art styles is
enormous, if not
infinite. With
exams over, it might be
time to undertake some
cultural education and
explore at least a few. The
following chronological
guide explains the most
profound and impactful
art streams found in
London’s numerous
galleries.
Gothic
The characteristic style
of the 12th
-15th
century
features metaphorical rep-
resentations of medieval
reality. The Gothic style
is famous for its portraits
with straight, distinct lines
and simplistic background
themes. Most Gothic
paintings tend to represent
historical or religious
figures and events in two
dimensions with a blue-
black colour scheme. At
times, Gothic art lacks
happiness and placidity,
which links back to
distress within European
society during that period.
Where to see the style
in London: Palace of
Westminster, Robert
Lewis Roumieu building
at 33-35 Eastcheap (both
Gothic Revival)
Renaissance
As the time went by,
religious and mytholog-
ical motives continued
to captivate the minds of
European artists of the
14th
-16th
century. They
started to explore colour
and shape through images
of Christ and Madonna
in natural settings. One
can distinguish Renais-
sance paintings by the
dominance of light and
a largely romanticised
colour palette, loved and
cherished by Raphael,
Titian, and Michelange-
lo – pioneers of this art
movement.
Where to see the style
in London: Bacchus and
Ariadne – Titian; Saint
Catherine of Alexandria
– Raphael; both at the
National Gallery
Baroque
This extravagant art
stream began to dominate
art workshops during 17th
-
18th
centuries. The exact
translation of barocco
is ‘a pearl of non-ideal
form’. Society of that
period saw excellence
in exaggerated luxury
of textures, forms and
colours. Baroque paint-
ings have an extremely
dynamic character, over-
filled with emotions and
light. Artists of that time
like Caravaggio, Rubens,
and Velásquez represented
the world through hyper-
bolic, large-scale shapes
showing the magnificence
of nature using generous
brush strokes and colours
like red, lead tin yellow,
and beige.
Where to see the style
in London: Samson and
Delilah – Peter Paul
Rubens; The Toilet of
Venus – Diego Velásquez;
both at the National
Gallery
Classicism
The art world of the
17th
-18th
century soon
shifted from the pompous
baroque towards more
realistic styles like
Classicism. Architects,
sculptors, and artists drew
their attention to rational
harmony between colour
and form, striving to
make their pieces immac-
ulate. They saw beauty
in linearity, symmetry,
and a restrained colour
palette full of undertones.
If you walk into a gallery
and see a piece looking
like it was made by an
A* student, then you are
probably standing in front
of a beautiful example of
Classicism. Some ‘A*
students’ of that art era
were: Nicolas Poussin,
Charles le Brun, and Karl
Bryullov.
Where to see the style
in London: A Baccha-
nalian Revel before a
Term – Nicolas Poussin
at the National Gallery;
Regency Classicism
section at V&A
Realism
Realism as an art
movement stems from
the 19th
century, resulting
in its collection being
the largest in the world.
A characteristic property
of the movement was the
reflection of critical social
and economic issues
where the artist often
conveys their opinion,
giving an appraisal on
the topic. Hence in the
spotlight are often scenes
from life of the working
class both in towns and
the countryside. This led
to the use of dark, earthy
palettes.
Where to see the style
in London: The execution
of Maximilian – Edouard
Manet; Still Life with
Apples and a Pomegran-
ate – Gustave Courbet;
both at the National
Gallery
Impressionism
Born in 1860s France,
Impressionism was
considered a complete
contrast to Realism.
Instead of expressing all
details of the surrounding
world, as done by Realists,
Impressionists like Degas,
Renoir, and Monet were
keen to embody the real
world through gener-
ating emotion within
the observer. This was
achieved by using soft
yet visible brush strokes
that gave a feeling of
tenderness and calmness.
This dreamy art style
captures the effects of
light by manipulating
palettes that include pure,
intense colours like blue,
white, and red. To enjoy
Impressionist pieces, one
simply needs to find the
most romantic and hazy
art section in the gallery.
Where to see the style
in London: Water-Lilies
– Claude Monet at the
Tate Modern; The Skiff –
Pierre-Auguste Renoir at
the National Gallery
Modern
Significant historical
events in 20th
century
promoted a rapid change
of values in society
causing art workshops
to produce pieces that
displayed a unique aura.
Artists moved on from
usual eclecticism and
began to explore dreams,
symbolism, and subjec-
tive experiences. The
characteristic modernist
approach is full of floral
ornaments, asymmetrical
forms, and complex
decorations. A modern
colour palette included
all parts of the colour
spectrum and was used
by famous modernists
such as Paul Gauguin,
Gustav Klimt, and Edvard
Munch. As time went by,
the Modern style diverged
into Cubism, Fauvism,
Futurism, and Surrealism
which appealed to wider
audiences and are consid-
ered separate art move-
ments within themselves.

Kahlo: Making Her Self
Up exhibition at V&A
From Titian to Renoir – spot the difference // CC
Frida Kahlo: making an icon into a caricature?
A new exhibition at the V&A promises to reveal an intimate side to the artist. While her self-portraits and
photographs prove revealing, Arts Writer Simran Kukran argues that the exhibition as a whole leaves a lot to be
desired.
F
rida Kahlo’s is
a feminist icon.
Her eyebrows,
jewellery, and
clothes are distinctly
recognisable through her
self-portraits, and Kahlo
is revered for challenging
gender norms and reject-
ing colonial influences as
a proud Mexican commu-
nist. This is the first time
the artwork, medication,
clothing,andotherperson-
al belongings have been
displayed outside of her
home on the outskirts of
Mexico City, now known
as the Museum of Frida
Kahlo. At the time of her
death, Kahlo instructed
her husband to seal off her
bathroom. Only in 2004
were its contents revealed.
Most of the contents of
this exhibition were found
in this way. The V&A
exhibition was curated
in partnership with the
Museum and Frida Kahlo
Foundation. It has been
advertised as “intimate”,
seeking to sensitively
display another side of the
artist, but crosses the line
into blunt and invasive.
The focus does not seem
to be on Kahlo’s artwork,
but instead on her clothing
and belongings.
The exhibition ad-
dresses Kahlo’s entire
life. In the first room
“It is striking
to see actual
photographs
of Kahlo
alongside her
self-portraits”
there are photographs of
Kahlo as a young girl,
followed by her earliest
works. It is striking to
see actual photographs
of Kahlo alongside her
self-portraits. Although
clearly recognisable,
in her self-portraits her
features look stronger
– harsh and more mas-
culine, with prominent
facial hair. In photographs
her face shape is softer
and, while the unibrow
is strong, facial hair is
barely visible. Aside from
being beautiful works
in their own right, the
photographs contextualise
the artworks aiding inter-
pretation. The balance is
skewed, however, and it
feels the powerful artwork
that should be taking
centre stage is stuck in the
background.
Kahlo suffered from
polio as a child, and a
traffic accident at 18 left
her disabled with chronic
pain.Although she aspired
to be a doctor, she never
fully recovered and did
not return to education.
She began painting while
bedridden. The details of
her health issues were kept
private, but her pain and
disability was explored
regularly in her artwork,
most famously in The
Broken Column (1944).
There is only a small
photo of the work visible,
but Kahlo’s prosthetic leg
sits in a large mirrored
case in the middle of a
dimly lit room with eerie
music playing. This feels
sensationalist, almost
perverse. It is as if her
pain is being fetishized.
Her orthopaedic corsets
are also on display. The
fact that Kahlo decorated,
almost graffitied, these
means their display as
works of art is less un-
comfortable. Particularly
moving is a foetus painted
onto the corset following
a termination for health
reasons. Her medication
is displayed alongside
letters appealing for
doctor’s appointments.
While her disability was
an important part of
Kahlo’s identity, it was
explored in her own terms
in her artwork; to force
this level of exposure
seems insensitive.
Kahlo was a proud
communist and Mexican
patriot, even changing her
birthyear of 1907 to 1910,
that of the Mexican Rev-
olution. Her passion was
reflected in her clothing;
she wore pre-colonial
traditional Mexican dress
to make an empowered
statement. There are
photos of her family
members wearing similar
clothing, and she was
proud of her matriarchal
heritage. The clothing has
been beautifully restored
and displayed. Captions
proudly highlight the fact
the clothing’s cigarette
burns and mending after
wear and tear mean it
was well loved – “her
wardrobe was not staged
but a second skin” – but is
this really so surprising?
Kahlo is an icon, yes – but
she is not just a character
for a Halloween costume.
Is it so shocking her
clothes were worn and
lived-in?
Kahlo’s makeup is
also displayed, with some
kohl used to darken her
distinctive eyebrows still
in its original packaging.
The curator notes Kahlo
“constructed” her identity
though her belongings
but, however beautiful,
they do not give nearly a
fraction of the insight her
expressive paintings do.
Perhaps her clothing
and belongings have a
different feel displayed
in her Mexico City home,
but something in the V&A
feels uncomfortable and
doesn’t sit quite right.
Leaving the exhibition
continues in this vein –
giftshop tote bags and
fridge magnets are deco-
rated with her image, and
you can purchase floral
headdresses inspired by
her look. There is also
Mexican hot sauce on
the shelves. It is unclear
what the purpose of
this is, but whatever the
purpose, it does not seem
to have been achieved.
Out in the garden there
is a very Instagrammable
wire sculpture topped
with flowers, with a
hashtag competition to
win a frozen margarita.
The exhibition sought to
reveal Kahlo’s identity in
an intimate way, but the
result is more like cari-
cature. While the style of
delivery is not special, the
exhibition is worth going
to see for Kahlo’s extraor-
dinary paintings alone.
