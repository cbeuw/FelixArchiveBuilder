FELIX
SEX SURVEY
NOW WITH 60%
MORE EMOJIS!!!
It’s been a long time coming, but the Felix Sex Survey is finally here. Over
the past few weeks, Imperial students, staff, and alumni filled out our
giant questionnaire, divulging all sorts of personal details about their
fantasies, desires, and experiences. This year an incredible 1,143 of you
completed the survey, helping us build up a picture of how Imperial
likes to get it on – from long distance relationships to sex work, STIs to
masturbating, no stone was left unturned.
Want to find out which department is getting it on the most? Or what
people feel is the optimum time to lose their virginity? Or whether or
not couples who met at Imperial are happier than others? Look inside
our eight-page pull-out to find out…
