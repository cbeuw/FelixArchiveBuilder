mperial College isn’t
the place it used to be.
The student body is
becoming less inward
focussed, less tolerant of
poor decision making on
the part of the university,
and less dismissive of
things beyond the four
walls of their degrees. We
have a way to go yet, but
the culture at our universi-
ty is starting to shift, and
a look back over the last
year suggests progress is
being made.
Beginning with the
elephant in the room: it’s
easy to overlook the fact
that this year a strike at
Imperial College actually
achieved something, with
university management
at Imperial and across
the country being forced
to concede on proposed
changes to staff pensions.
Student involvement bol-
stered this, with students
standing on the picket
lines, and over a hundred
attending events in soli-
darity at the start and end
of the action.
Certain ‘progressive’
groups on campus, such
as the Labour Society
and IQ, enjoyed record
high membership this
year. Divest Imperial, the
campaign to get College
to take its money out of
toxic investments in fossil
fuel, and the Left Forum,
a non-partisan political/
campaign group, also
enjoyed high engage-
ment this year. Some of
these groups are coming
together to form a united
‘Action at Imperial,’ with
the goal of making our
university a slightly better
place.
There are even positives
In spite of the surprise
addition of the Wellbeing
Representation Network
this year, rep engagement
across the university has
been relatively high, with
reps campaigning for
better personal tutoring,
a stronger counselling
service, and agreeing with
staff on how the curricu-
lum review (in which all
the content in every course
is up for change) will take
place. Meanwhile the
liberation officers’ work
this year has included
a campaign for gender
neutral bathrooms, or-
ganising a talk by Akala,
work on neurodivergence,
improving accessibility
in Ethos, and fighting to
improve the College’s
bursary provision. Union
Council, the Union’s chief
decision-making body,
has also been largely
well attended this year,
and while the contentious
and often tedious nature
of these meetings can be
off-putting, they are a
vast improvement from
the empty rooms and low
attendance which plagued
past years.
In all of these cases,
Felix itself played a
significant role, thanks in
large part to the editorial
team. Liberation officers
have had regular columns,
giving them a platform to
discuss the oft-overlooked
but important issues faced
by the groups they rep-
resent. During the UCU
dispute, it was easier to
find news in Felix than the
national press. Lastly and
perhaps most importantly,
Felix has challenged both
the Union and College
this year. Regarding the
former, Felix has detailed
the poor handling of
certain sensitive issues,
and more generally has
done a good job reporting
on the decisions being
made in our name and
on our behalf in Beit. On
the latter, articles have
detailed the university’s
vast assets, the significant
pay and Brobdingnagian
expenses of senior uni-
versity management, and
inequality at Imperial.
All of this suggests that
the mood at Imperial is
shifting, but there’s still
more to be done. First of
all, those of us who feel
these improvements are
important must work to
ensure what we have isn’t
lost – that this year won’t
just have been a flash in
the pan. That means we
have to actively engage in
representation, liberation,
and a student newspaper
to cover it all: supporting
things from the sidelines
isn’t enough. More am-
bitiously, it means using
this year as a foundation
– channelling what we’ve
achieved into productively
challenging the university
and refusing to accept at
face value what we’re told.
Does a university who
pays its “key management
personnel” almost £300k
each, with more than
£100m in surplus need to
cut staff salaries (in real
terms) or the SCR break-
fast (in very real terms)
to save money? Should
these “KMPs” be foisting
wide scale changes to the
degree courses on reluc-
tant academics? When
one quarter of all the
undergraduate students
sign something, is it un-
reasonable to expect some
kind of formal response?
Is it acceptable that for
years, some departments
haven’t had so much as
a common room? Should
the foremost British
Science and Technology
institute invest its money
in arms, cigarettes, and
fossil fuels? As students,
we have a responsibility
to ask these questions
– we shouldn’t just be
spectators: there would be
no university without us.
Imperial might look the same, but change is happening // Imperial College
“We must
engage in
representation
liberation
and a student
newspaper to
cover it all”
Things will only
change if people who care
do something about it. It
seems we’re starting to,
and I sincerely hope this
trend continues in the next
academic year.
If any of this resonates
with you, and you want
to know what you can do
to help, feel free to drop
me an email at abhijay.

In defence of the Syrian Democratic Forces

S
everal weeks
ago, I wrote a
comment piece
for this paper that
advocated Western sup-
port to the organization
known as SDF (Syrian
Democratic Forces), a
group I described as: “an
organization which has an
ideology that combines
libertarian socialism,
gender equality, respect
for ethnic minorities, secu-
larism and green politics”.
This article provoked the
publication of a refutation
piece several issues later,
which accused me of
spreading propaganda for
a hateful terrorist organ-
isation. As my ideology
could not be further from
that description, I would
like to address the claims
spouted in the response, if
only to stop a mischarac-
terisation of my position
by what seems an obvious
attempt of whitewashing
the atrocities of the Syrian
government.
Four accusations are
charged against the SDF.
Each of them would be
terrible on their own:
the use of child female
soldiers under the influ-
ence of drugs; dressing
their militiamen as civil-
ians; preventing civilians
from leaving battle zones;
and supporting attacks in
Europe. The piece even
compares them to ISIS,
which, in my opinion, is
an affirmation that can
only be made from either
ignorance or malice.
On child soldiers,
the source provided is a
YouTube video hosted by
a channel owned by the
Al-Hamza Division. This
is a Turkish-backed militia
that forms part of the wide
array of forces Turkey has
been using in Rojava to
wrestle control back from
the SDF and its allies. If
there were a group that
would like to portray the
SDF as a tyrannical force,
it would be them, so we
should consider the pos-
sibility the video provided
has been staged, as has
been the case of many
footage pieces during
the war. Nevertheless,
there is indeed a report
by Human Rights Watch
that denounces the use of
child soldiers by the YPG,
the backbone of the SDF.
While very concerning,
the report also mentions
these incidents are far
from common in the
YPG and admits a tenet
policy of the organisation
is refusing to use child
soldiers. In addition, it
should be noted that as
recent as 2014, ISIS was
engaging into a genocidal
campaign against the
Kurds, so, terrible as it
is, some teenagers were
forced to fight to save their
lives. The cases reported
happened under units that
were not under the central
control of the YPG, and
the organisation promised
to investigate the matter,
reiterating their commit-
ment to universal human
rights. They also ask for
external support in their
mission to maintain basic
civil standards in both the
war front and the areas
where their control is
tenuous. In this, the YPG
have done more to tackle
the problem of child
soldiers in Syria than
any of the other warring
parties, which have also
been accused of using
underage individuals in
their armies.
The second claim is
that the SDF dresses
their combatants with
civilian clothes, which, as
explained in the article,
goes against Article 48 of
the Geneva Conventions,
blurring the line between
civilians and soldiers. I
have only been able to
find a single instance of
this happening – precisely
in the video provided by
the writer. I assume the
SDF does not encourage
its forces to use civilian
clothes, but probably in
the chaos of the war some
units, or even individual
soldiers, have retorted to
this tactic to escape the
enemy’s fire. Not that
it matters: according to
Amnesty International,
the Turkish army has
indiscriminately fired at
civilians fleeing Afrin,
killing up to 17 children
in just a single incident.
Thus, it seems that sadly
Article 48 is rendered
moot by the cruelty of
Erdogan.
The piece also claims
the SDF have been
blocking civilians from
leavingAfrin. The spokes-
man for the UN Secretary
General is the source for
this claim, as it is shown
in the video linked by
the author. However, the
very spokesman admits
the UN has not been able
to contact the local au-
thorities of Afrin, which
implies that their source
of information is Turkey,
as no other parties where
fighting in the area. The
story was only reported
by organisms like the
Anadolu Agency, the
propaganda arm of the
Turkish government. I
would like to see more
solid evidence.
Finally, it is claimed
Erdogan-critical regional
MP of the leftist party
Die Linke was recently
hit in the head and called
a ‘traitor’ in Turkish by
an unknown man. Across
the Atlantic, supporters
of Erdogan became
infamous when they beat
up protesters during the
last visit of the Turkish
dictator to Washington
D.C.

“Comparing
the SDF to ISIS
can only come
from either
ignorance or
malice”
the SDF advocate terrorist
acts against civilians in
Europe. According to the
news that is taken as an
evidence for this claim,
a Kurdish group based in
the diaspora, the Apoist
Youth Initiative, called for
violence against assets of
the Turkish government,
as well as the parties and
organisations that, accord-
ing to them, enable the
violations of human rights
carried out by the present
Turkish government (i. e.
most European govern-
ments). The group follows
Abdüllah Öcalan, the
long-time jailed founder
of the wide Kurdish leftist
movement, but apart from
both taking inspiration
from him, no links have
been found between the
AYI and the SDF forces
fighting in Syria. I want
to state that I absolutely
condemn the actions of
this group against civil-
ians and institutions of
Turkish origin, that have
no blame whatsoever for
the foreign policy of their
country. Nonetheless,
Kurdish led groups are not
the only ones increasing
the tension among the
diasporas. In Germany, an
Believing that we
should not intervene
militarily in Syria is a
completely legitimate
position, one I happen to
hold. However, I will not
accept falsehoods directed
against the only group that
is showing some com-
mitment to democracy,
tolerance of minorities,
and feminism. While I
agree past intervention in
Lybia and Iraq has been
a colossal disaster, that
does not mean we have
to diplomatically support
either the criminal Syrian
government (which has
been known to use gas
against its own citizens)
or the Islamist controlled
opposition (whose record
with human rights is
shaky at best). That is
why I believe the best-
case scenario for Syria is
a SDF-led government.
Because being against
Western imperialism does
not mean blindly support-
ing the worst satraps of
the Middle East.
