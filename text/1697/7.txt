hen choos-
ing our
food, our
conscious
self is never in full control
– I always let my cravings
get the best of me. For in-
stance, when I am sad I eat
ice-cream; when I smell
a pizza, I will instantly
want to eat one. But have
you ever considered how
our hearing can impact on
food choices?
In London, there are
approximately 39,000
food service establish-
ments. In order to compete
with other restaurants,
store managers will use
different sensory cues to
lure us into consuming
their food. Bakeries, for
example, pump out the
smell of freshly baked
bread to attract customers,
while some stores play the
UK top 40 to make them-
selves more appealing to a
younger age group. This
influence also extends to
music and background
noise, with both genre and
volume having an impact
on our appetite and food
choice.
A study published in
late April by Professor
Dipayan Biswas and
collaborators has demon-
strated how music can
influence our choice of
eating either healthy or
unhealthy food. Their
hypothesis was based
on previous findings in
different studies: our
perception of taste can
be modified via ambient
music; in a noisy envi-
ronment our perception
of sweetness and saltiness
decreases while the
crunchiness of food is
enriched. Other studies
have shown emotional
connection to background
music can also affect how
one evaluates wine. These
examples goes on, but no
one has studied the effect
of music on our choice of
food until now.
“Higher
music volume
can elicit
excitement,
leading us
to choose
unhealthy
food”
“The definition
of‘high
volume’used
in the study
is itself quite
obscure and
subjective”
From these results, the
researchers hypothesised
that music can impact on
our mood: higher music
volume (e.g. club music)
can elicit excitement,
leading us to choose high
energy and unhealthy
food, since these fatty
foods help reduce stress
and high level of excite-
ment. Vice versa, music
that prompts us to relax
may help us to make
healthier food choices, as
we gain better control of
ourselves. This effect is
demonstrated by mindful-
ness exercises that emo-
tional eaters implement
to help them lose weight,
with a study finding that
individuals who practice
relaxation exercises have
greater control in food
consumption.
Testing this in the
laboratory, supermarkets
and cafes, results showed
background music has an
effect on our emotional
state, as reflected by heart
rate.Amore relaxed mind-
state, as indicated by a
lower heart rate, is linked
to an increased preference
for healthy food. In the
experiments conducted
in both supermarkets and
cafés, low volumes of
music and background
noise correlate with in-
creased sales of healthy
food, regardless of the
genre of music, impli-
cating how subconscious
cues can trigger consump-
tion of food.
Translating this knowl-
edge into real-life applica-
tions, perhaps restaurants
that sell healthy food
may want to have gentle,
quiet music floating in the
background, while fast
food chains can turn up
the volume to boost sales.
Other business strategies
could also be modified
accordingly using the
results of this study: when
designing menus for a
stall in a noisy setting,
such as a food market,
they should focus more on
selling unhealthy food, as
consumers are more likely
to purchase such items in
this setting. Just imagine
how likely you are to
choose a burger over a
salad in Borough Market!
This can even be
extended to the design
of the market or malls,
as building walls can
be designed to absorb
sound to create a tranquil
environment, or walls
can even be put between
sub-departments to allow
different volumes or
genres to be played in
different areas.
As for us, if we want
to purchase and consume
healthy food, perhaps we
can plug in our calming
music when we are going
for our grocery shop, so
we won’t ‘accidentally’
bring home the whole
snack aisle. Otherwise,
we could choose to dine
in places with a lower
volume of background
noise, therefore reducing
subconscious cues to
binge eat highly calorific
food.
an optimal music volume.
For example, I turn my
music up so loud that you
can hear it through my
earphones, and I find that
‘just right’. My roommate
disagrees, as she thinks
a silent environment
more relaxing. Using
this example, it is clear
the definition of ‘high
volume’ itself is quite
obscure, and some indi-
viduals might find loud
music more relaxing than
quiet background noise.
Furthermore, background
noises – people chatting,
glasses clinking, inter-
coms – cannot be con-
trolled in real life situation
such as in a supermarket
or a café, rendering
these finding limited to
individual context. While
these findings are not a
universal rule to be follow
at all costs, perhaps it is
still a cheeky method into
tricking ourselves to eat
healthily!

O
ver the past
few months,
I have been
updating you
all with a number of
conservation stories,
both optimistic, and less
so. Now, to wrap things
up, I thought it would
be a good idea to give
you all a few ideas on
how you can make a few
small changes to your
daily routine to help save
the planet. This does not
have to be as drastic as
going vegetarian, but
can be very simple. I
have listed a few ways
below that I would like
you to consider.
As we have all seen
in recent times, plastics
are a big problem for the
environment, and it is im-
portant that we reduce our
consumption. To do this
when visiting pubs and
clubs, do not use straws
unless the establishment
has biodegradable or
plastic alternatives.
Likewise, when buying
bottled drinks, try to avoid
ones in plastic packaging,
or make sure you recycle
your bottles afterwards
if you cannot. If you are
similar to me and love
a cup of tea or two on
your daily commute, then
please carry a reusable
cup. Not only will you be
saving the environment,
but many coffee shops
also offer discounts to
those customers that do.
All of these small changes
do add up, and once you
become aware of the
other alternatives you can
use, you can significantly
reduce the amount of
single-use plastic you use
and dispose of.
you can volunteer your
time with your favourite
animals! This has benefits
on both sides: not only
will you be directly con-
tributing to conservation,
but it can also help your
wellbeing. Studies have
shown that people who
spend time immersed in
nature have a better mental
wellbeing than those that
do not. So, it’s a win-win
situation – best of luck
getting involved! You
never know, you may
discover a new passion
that drives you to help
safeguard a specific part
the natural world.

Could platypus milk help beat antibiotic resistance?
I
n 2014, the World
Health Organisation
warned the interna-
tional community
of the threat of antibiotic
resistance. Due to an ex-
cessive use of antibiotics
– mostly fed to food-pro-
ducing animals – bacteria
are able to develop re-
sistance, which they then
transmit to the next gener-
ation of bugs, who can no
longer be killed by avail-
able pharmaceuticals. As
a result, diseases which
have been treatable for
years, thanks toAlexander
Fleming’s discovery, are
once again responsible for
many deaths – killing ap-
proximately 5000 people
in the UK each year.
In this critical situation,
hope arises from new
research being carried
out on species which
previously had no funding
due to their insignificance.
Australia’s wildlife is one
of the areas of interest. A
protein in platypus milk
was found to have antibac-
terial properties by a team
of Australian scientists
from Deakin University,
Victoria, in 2010. A recent
paper published by Dr
Janet Newman, from Aus-
tralia’s national science
agency CSIRO, identifies
the functional groups of
this protein enabling it to
combat superbugs.
As indicated by crys-
tallisation, the molecule
is unique, and presents no
similarity with any other
known protein. Conse-

two mammals on earth
which lay eggs. They
are considered mammals
because they feed their
babies with milk similar
to cows or humans. What
could then explain their
lactating proteins contain
such antibiotic? Like
no other mammals, the
monotremes are unable to
breastfeed their progen-
iture; instead they sweat
milk, which is exposed
to the outside environ-
ment and thus has the
susceptibility of possibly
becoming contaminated.
This evolution of the
platypus may be its de-
fensive response for a safe
and sterile delivery system
of milk in order to protect
the young from possible
infection. The particu-
lar fold of the protein
explains its “antibacterial
properties against some of
the nastier bugs you find
in the environment but
not against some bacteria
found in the guts of the
young”, Newman reports,
after observing the
molecule killing bacteria
such as Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterococcus
faecalis.
Even though the
platypus milk could lead
to the creation of new an-
tibiotic treatment against
superbugs, drug discovery
willtakealongtimebefore
patients are offered new
pharmaceuticals. Thus, it
is still crucial to counter
bacterial resistance to an-
tibiotics by reducing the
massive use of antibiotics
worldwide. The promise
of innovative antibiotics
being developed against
superbugs is a relief in
the eventuality of a future
‘post-antibiotics era,’ but
should not be taken for
granted, as research is still
required to understand
the protein’s interactions
before it can be commer-
cialised as a treatment.

quently, this constitutes a
new field for researchers
and scientist to explore!
The monotreme lac-
tation protein (MLP)
includes a monomer
of twelve helices, two
short β-strands, and a
deep fold which gives it
the nickname “Shirley
Temple,” after the famous
American child star
with curly hair from the
1930s. This discovery
reinforces Newman’s
belief that monotremes
may be an unexploited
source for identification
of new proteins, with
interesting properties such
as antimicrobial activity.
Dr Newman was not
overly surprised by this
as she states: “Platypus
are such weird animals
that it would make sense
for them to have weird
biochemistry”.
