Core Universities
BY ANDREW SMITH
A five university core within the
Russell Group of eighteen elite
institutions has been revealed
this week.
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector
of Imperial College, has admitted
to F E L I X that the Vice-
Chancellors of the original Group
of five universities, Imperial,
Oxford, Cambridge, U C L and
Warwick, do still 'occasionally'
meet.
Speaking to F E L I X , the
Rector scoffed at continuing
rumours that an Ivy League of
British Universities is being
planned.
Earlier this week, at the
second meeting of the 'Aldwych
Group' (student representatives
of the universities invited to the
Russell Group) some members
have questioned whether an Ivy
League was 'morally acceptable'.
In contrast, Eric Forth MP,
a Junior Government Education
Minister, speaking this week at a
N U S / U L U student question
time, said that he had no
problem which such a League.
He continued by saying that it
would-be 'difficult to prevent'
and suggested that an unofficial
one currently exists.
Also discussed was top-up
fees with Mr Forth insisting that
they are not being considered by
the Government. However, the
Rector has said that he is not
opposed to the 'basic principle'
of the fees. Admitting that they
are 'highly undesirable', Sir
Ronald has said that the College
might be forced to consider top-
up fees if it came to 'preserving
College'. He sought to dampen
immediate fears of such a move
by insisting that he does not see
fees as a possibility at present.
The Rector would not
confirm whether any unofficial
discussions of top-up fees at
either the Russell Group or the
Group of Five have taken place.
He stressed that fees had not
been an 'agenda item'.
SOAS Clampdown
BY THE NEWS TEAM
After last week's U L U decision
to ban all literature of the
Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir,
there has been a further incident
at the School of Oriental and
African Studies (SOAS).
Last Thursday at a meeting
of the '1924 Committee' (SOAS's
Muslim Society) Faisal
Muhammad, Chairman of the
Society and member of Hizb ut-
Tahrir, paid tribute to the
suicide bomber from the Hamas
Islamic resistance movement,
whose attack on a bus in Tel-
Aviv on 19th October killed 22
people. As a consequence the
SOAS Management Committee
released a statement on Monday
evening stating that "no Speaker
representing the views of Hizb
ut-Tahrir, whether from within
or outside the University, is
permitted at future meetings of
the 1924 Committee". The
SOAS student body were not
consulted about the ban and
convened a general meeting
yesterday to discuss the Union's
policy on the issue. There was no
decision reached as F E L I X
went to press. Rumours that the
Management Committee's
decision will be revoked on the
grounds that it is a breach of the
right to the freedom of speech,
have been leaked to FELIX.
This follows another
incident which occurred at
King's College. On Wednesday
26th October, a meeting of the
so-called 'Culture Society' was
planned. Following fears that
there would be trouble if the
meeting was allowed to
commence, the Student's Union
decided to cancel the meeting for
that day. Despite this decision
the organisers attempted to
restage the meeting. A statement
by King's College Student
Union said that "the disturbing
atmosphere of the meeting led to
the decision to call the Police".
Around 45 police officers were
involved in assisting King's
College authorities to disperse
the meeting. The fears of
possible disruption were
reportedly due to the official
meeting that the King's Jewish
Student Society was holding at
the same time. King's sources
claim members of the 'Culture
Society' had threatened to attend
and create a disruption. The
Jewish Society's meeting was
curtailed and the members were
escorted, protected by the Police,
off the premises .

Laser Trauma and Computer
Centre Kindness
Welcome to the last bastion of
the Luddite in the Cyberaged
Technozone of IC (see s-files for
details). This week the laser
printer decided to add its own
artistic embellishments as it
printed. Its style was abstract -
big black smears down the
centre, presumably symbolic of
its snail-trail progression through
unending roads of pages.
Anyway, I'll have no truck with
anything post-Impressionist so
its days were numbered. None of
our usual experts knew how to fix
it but the Computer Centre said
they would try and so off it went.
But wait! No laser, no paper!
No paper, no F E L I X ! Luckily,
heroes emerged from the
woodwork like glow-worms.
Firstly Sam Michel in the Union
lent us his 300dpi laser which
produced a couple of pages
(thanks Sam!) before the
Computer Centre phoned to say
they could lend us a HP 4M! I
think they deserve a big thank
you, especially in light of the bad
press they sometimes receive.
Thanks particularly to Mr
Spirling, for holding the broken
machine overnight and M r
Brendan 'Bruce' Maguire for
securing the loaned machine.
Mixed Muses
I hope that some of you who
usually skip the standby section
will find time to read the Classic
vs Pop article. The idea is at least
a year old but the writers in
question have finally torn
themselves away from the
countries they love to sojourn in
another land. I thought the gig
review worked better. Is there
something inherently primal and
therefore globally acquirable
about pop? The opera review
sometimes seems to have its
tongue too much in its cheek to
avoid betraying its lack of
knowledge. Does the greater
depth of opera indicate a higher
art form or just an art with an
elaborate set of entry codes? At a
gig, as Patrick saw, you are
literally carried away.
Loose Limbs
Having been accused of
complacency by some after
comments against police-bashing
I made a few weeks ago I'd like to
redress the balance by pointing
out the latest idiocy to come from
the Criminally unjustifiable Bill.
Although not directly related, the
Independent today carried an
article concerning the revised
role of the Special Branch in
Rusky-free and IRA-less Britain.
They are to redirect their
surveillance efforts towards
protesters, activists and 'public
disorder'. I won't even bother
shouting 'Police State'. Just: if
that is what they are going to do
with the spies then what are they
going to do with army? Use them
in the public arena too? It's the
same thing and it scares me.
