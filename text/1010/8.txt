Poor Jeffrey Archer - Although the
honourable, clear skinned member
of the Conservative party is posi-
tively rolling in it, artistically he is
impoverished. After dicing with
bankruptcy, Archer pinned his liter-
ary colours to the top of the Best-
sellers list within the first two sen-
tences of his 1976 debut, Not a
penny more, not a penny less:
"Making a million legally has
always been difficult." Now come,
come Jeffrey: Insider dealing?
"Making a million illegally
has always been a little easier."
And here begins and endeth
Archer's claim on literary respect.
Is money the motivating fac-
tor in the world of popular fiction?
Are writers clutching their precious
first manuscripts and bleating "
I
had Costner in mind," as they dis-
cuss screenplay rights with
Hollywood moguls? Indeed as a
friend embarked on the painful
path to that first novel he reminded
me that as "Grisham and Crichton
are proving, it's plot and not char-
acters that count." Undoubtedly
true if you live in that creative
sphere in which Roxette and Bad
Boys Inc are proving that it's tits
and arse and not music that
counts.
Big bucks seem a factor for
many, but what about those for
whom the receiver's bell doth not
toll? For someone who won't slap
on her first layer of foundation for
less than ten grand, I very much
doubt that Naomi Campbell's first
novel will have much impact on
her coffers. What about the good
looking half of arena-packing
Newman and Baddiel? Will Rob (or
Robert as he now wishes to be
known) Newman's debut
Dependence Day see legions of
adolescent girls and angst-ridden
males laying seige to Waterstones?
I don't think so.
So if it's not filthy lucre
they're after, what are Naomi and
Robert's game? Newman claims
writing was always his vocation,
stand-up comedy merely a side-
line. But Campbell? Is she out to
prove that regardless of whether or
not the waif look is in vogue, she
remains a well rounded supermod-
el? I don't imagine there is much
more than meets the eye where
Campbell is concerned. Except per-
haps the ghost writer lurking in the
shadows to transcribe her divine
utterances.
Ghost writers eh? Arguments
about whether the Bard was
English or not pale into insignifi-
cance. The pressing concern
becomes whether or not he ever
slipped on the catwalk and flashed
his knickers

is the perogative
of having no
mates. An air
stewardess asked
this ungainly
looking chap
wether he liked
boys or girls...
sexually that is.
He pondered
this, and said "I like football, but I
don't play so I can't really call my
self a footballer, and if you follow
that argument through, I can't
really call myself a heterosexual
either."
Apathy in my eyes has
gained something of a raw deal
over the years. "Oh why are you so
apathetic about everything?" they
whinny; "Because we are all going
to die irrespective of who had the
tidiest bedroom Mother, do you
honestly think that life is a steady
procession towards some forceable
goal that we should all try to
achieve for the good of ourselves
and the rest of humanity, or some
sort of race in which we must all
accumulate the most possessions
before we die all fat and sweaty?

clatter of commu-
nion bells to this
day.
I have always
resented religion,
Catholicism in par-
ticular, mainly due
to its effect on my
mental heath, but
when people
bandy words like sinister and
pointless around in the same sen-
tence, you know that they are talk-
ing about the Bible and Prayer-mat
people. It's all a big excuse to
cleanse the world of Kurds, or
which ever socio-economic/ethnic
group the oligarchy is currently
using to distract the masses from
the realms of fact, and their gener-
al incompetence. (Las Malvinas
1982). It is no coincidence that
hatred and war follow religion
around like fleas on a dog, and in
terms of world peace and happi-
ness I would suggest that everyone
just stay in bed and forget about it.
Be apathetic, because to that end
you are unlikely to die in a hail of
bullets. After all, what was the best
way to avoid the chemical
weapons menace and other gener-
al military hazards imposed on the
soldiers in the gulf war? Not join-
ing the Army was the obvious one.
