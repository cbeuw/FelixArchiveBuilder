James's Hall Survival Guide
By Adrian J. Chung
I'm not British. That in itself is
not surprising. The flight I took
to get here spent many hours
over the Atlantic Ocean. I guess
that qualifies me as an overseas
student. That too is not surpris-
ing. How does a foreigner adjust
to the alien territory that all Brits
take for granted? Perhaps this
can be surprising. Take College
Halls for example...
Freshers' week was weeks
ago and the free supply of wine,
cheese and crisps was fast run-
ning out. The financially painful
and generally unhealthy diet of
fast food was taking its toll. I was
staying in a room in a hall of resi-
dence meant to be self-catering.
That is, a kitchen to be shared
with 22 other freshers who hap-
pened to be living on the same
staircase with me.
The typical fresher has lit-
tle or no cooking experience. I
was no exception. The hall
kitchen was quite a daunting
room to master, let alone enter.
"For those with no culinary
background it is easy to be put off by
roomsfittedwith appliances which
you are expected to use competently
the first time. For this reason, the
kitchen is one of the easiest places in
which to make a complete idiot of
oneself. Thefirsthurdle is to enter
the kitchen. Make up an excuse..."
In I strode with some bread
to toast. Luckily I timed it per-
fectly. The kitchen was vacant.
The last thing I wanted to do was
to negotiate the entire length of a
floor occupied by one or more
groups of Europeans, discussing
unknown pop-groups, alien
forms of recreation, or characters
of some obscure soap.
In such situations any-
where you stood made you feel
like you were obstructing some-
one from making some important
eye
point on a topic you knew you'd
never be able to understand. I
was the only one in the kitchen. I
felt safe.
"Don't even attempt to master
all the appliances all at once! Begin
small and work your way up. Your
first goal should be to successfully
warm up a meal..."
There were two ways to do
this in most college hall
kitchens: heat or nuke, the latter
having the advantages of the
brainless approach (just set timer
and turn on microwave) and
using less crockery.
Happily the College Hall
starter leaflet gave reasonable
enough directions for locating
the nearest major supplier of
packaged meals - J. Sainsbury's.
Unfortunately the prices of
microwavables was prohibitive.
I'd be better off eating at the
Union. The variety of meals that
come in cans was most enlighten-
ing. I bought a saucepan and a
can of beans and sausage to start
off with. Right! I'm ready to
cook!
Most freshers reach this
level of competence easily - after
burning a few extra layers of
semi-edible lining onto their
newly acquired saucepans.
"Cooking raw food - although
this requires a bit more time and skill
the end result can be more satisfying
and in the long run save money,
especially if buyingfoods in bulk."
I wasn't prepared to make
the 20-minute walk twice every
day to buy fresh raw food, so buy-
ing in bulk for an entire week
seemed like a wise decision. The
load of meat and frozen veg made
the return journey seem a lot
longer than 20 minutes but I
eventually managed to hobble up
three flights of stairs to the
kitchen. In all fairness I should
have had at least one-fifth of one
shelf of freezer space. I soon
learned that hall kitchens were
anything but fair.
"Before setting out to buy gro-
ceries always check that you have
space in thefridge andfreezer."
After rearranging the entire
contents of the freezer I eventual-
ly fitted everything in. Few fresh-
ers took the care to maximise
utilisation of available space. My
Third World upbringing ensured
that I was expert at this.
"As students tend to carry out
their resupply operations at similar
times, any space you mayfindmay
not be there when you return. You'l
need to reserve the space..."
Packaging - cereal boxes,
cardboard cases for microwave
meals, boxes for fish fingers and
burgers. Anything opaque and
occupying lots of volume would
do. It didn't matter if they were
empty. That space was mine and
rightly so.
Some students soon found
out what I was doing when they
moved the boxes around. To
make the vacuous nature of the
contents less obvious I switched
to using frozen wet FELIX. A
moist package of five or more
issues frozen in the freezer had
the same consistency of a frozen
lump of meat. No one would even
attempt to unwrap all the layers
in the vain search for that rare
commodity, freezer space.
Becoming master of the
hall kitchen became easier with
each passing day. Few college
students reach the stage where
they cook most of their meals
from raw but I thought I had
conquered the self-catering chal-
lenge. Later the hall kitchen was
to get its revenge in the form of
the Freezer Monster, aka Fridge
Fairy. But that's another story...
