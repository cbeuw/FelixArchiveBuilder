IC Men lstvs RHBNC Q
H
We flew into the lead when "Rent
Boy" easily converted a third
minute penalty. They equalised
soon after, thanks to their NZ
international, and there were
many missed chances at both
ends. The second half was a filthy
affair and in the last ten minutes
our chances of qualifying were
lost when their international
popped two more in. Our legs
were too knackered to fight back.
ICMen 2nd vs RHBNC 0
Following on from a convincing
win against QMW in which James
Cooper scored a hat-trick, IC
came up against a strong
Holloway side. Pressure in the
second half led to a penalty flick
which Toby Rolph converted. In
the latter stages another flick was
missed but IC held on for the win,
qualifying for the next round.
ICMen 3rd vs RHBNC L
*
A glorious display of goals and
glaring misses kept the band-
wagon rolling for us.
Despite chances, neither
team took advantage in the first
half. This was helped by an
excellent save by Stuart McTavish
and solid defending by the back
four. Overwhelming domination
of the second half resulted in two .
goals for Richard Brunt,
confirming our place in the
knockout stage of the BUSA
competition. Keep it up lads.
IC Indoor Men 1 st vs Hounslow 0
IC inspired by Captain Kim
Jabbams leadership played hard
to gain a lead, with goals from
Mark Robertson and Chris Brock.
Inevitably Hounslow scored,
making it 2-1 at half-time, and
levelled early in the second half.
Chris slotted in another goal, but
Hounslow equalised again. Chris
scored, and frantic defending kept
us in the lead for the last few
minutes. Goal keeper Lee
Maartensz, and central defenders
Toby Rolph and Damon Dupont
gave outstanding performances.
But an excellent team effort
enabled us to topple one of
Hockey's finest.

IC 1 st XV vs RHBNC L

The game started at a furious
pace, with both teams keen to
exploit any chances.
Early forward pressure by
RHBNC was rewarded by a try.
IC, incensed by this, advanced tin.
ball well into RHBNC's territory.
This was sustained until Mark
Wishart finally broke the
deadlock and scored.
In second half IC lost their
attacking edge allowing RHBNC
to pull away by capitalising on
chances.
IC 2nd XV vs RHBNC 0
it * • ^
After three near misses IC finally
managed to secure a victory
against RHBNC in a thrilling
encounter.
Down 3-0 at half time and IC
stormed into the second half.
Tries by Simon Fuller and Jamil
complemented by a penalty and 2
conversions by G. Williams saw
IC through to a victory.

ICtawQMW
We still haven't had a proper team
practice and we didn't have a full
team. Our guys were hungry and
hung-over, and didn't appreciate
QMWs cocky attitude in the
changing room. So, we started off
with a 10-0 lead and never really
looked back. Once again our
defence was lacking and we
almost set a new team club record
in fouls. Luckily, the referees
didn't understand Greek, and we
managed to control the game.
QMW were foolishly
desperate and fell to pieces in the
last minutes. This season looks
bright, but we haven't played our
best by far.
Badminton 0
IC Ladies vs RHBNC
Once again, in less than an hour,
the IC Ladies Badminton squad
obliterated the opposition to
retain their 100% UAU record.
With only LSE remaining they
should top the league. The losing
games were forgone to lack of
court time. Well done girls!!

Initially we could not finish the
runs and score. That was until
Maryam passed to Eleanor who
scored to put us in the lead. The
beginning of the second half was
inconclusive. Then on one corner,
a defender from Charing Cross
stuck her arm out at the ball in
the box, giving the Dribblers a
penalty. Helen took the shot,
scored and we were 2-0 up! We
recorded our first win of the
season and secured a place in the I
2nd round of the cup, though we
don't have a specialist keeper.
Thanks to those who played.
ICmen Ist vs QMWC Ist 0
We got off to a bad start, letting in
a goal in the first five minutes and
losing Ritch Craig after a clash of
heads. The equaliser came when
She Olambala battled his way
through a defender, allowing Dan
Lourdea to score. It wasn't until
halfway through the second half
that Imperial went ahead: a cross
from Mike Jarvis was met by a
header from Dan Lourdea. When
QMW moved forward, the defence
held tight. At the end, the result
didn't justifyahe performance but
Imperial were happy as they
maintain the only 100% record in
the premii « i >|.

IC l o t e vs RHBNC
The match was clos> ' contested
from the start. We wei i slow to
gain momentum and they went
ahead, but by the end of the third
quarter we managed to get within
2 points of them. This was due to
accurate shooting and tight
' pefence. It was a very physical
"match with both teams fighting
for possession (almost literally!).
The real success was that we all
kept our tempers, despite the lack
of umpires.

ICvs Essex 0
We kicked off to a superb start
this season with a victory over
Essex. After a shaky start the
entire team rallied to a nail-biting
last game victory. Special
mentions go to Ben Wall who
bowled a series of 530, Phil West
for his moral boosting 221 and
Rachel Tay for keeping up her
usual excellent standard.
