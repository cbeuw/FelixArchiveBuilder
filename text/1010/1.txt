Boat House Blues
BY LYNN BRAVEY
A multi-million pound
development project has been
planned at the Imperial College
Boat House.
The Putney based
development will provide
improved training facilities and
changing rooms, a larger area for
the storage of the boats of
Imperial College Boat Club, a
workshop and a small hall of
residence for students of IC.
The project has been given
support by the College
Governing Body and an appeal
for funding to college Alumni,
past rowers and industry is
planned for the near future. The
launch of the appeal is being
held back until planning
permission for the new building
is received.
There has been a strong
suggestion that the project will
be receiving money from the
Harlington Trust. The Trust has
2.5 million pounds that is held
in a fund for students use. The
money was originally raised
from the extraction of gravel
from the Harlington Sports
Field.
Each year the Trustees are
allowed to approve the spending
of up to £50,000 on student
based projects. For grants higher
than £50,000, a proposal must
receive approval from the
Governing Body before any
money can be released. Figures
in the region of half a million
pounds have been suggested to
the Governing Body.
However, it has been
reported that College authorities
are only willing to approve up to
£350,000. They hope that money
for the venture will not need to
come out of the Harlington
Trust Fund at all. Peter Mee,
College Registrar, told FELIX
that the College was, "Providing
the support, in principle...to
persuade people that this is a
potentially successful venture."
Lucy Chothia, Imperial
College Union (ICU) President
and one of the Harlington
trustees, is enthusiastic about
the Union's decision to support
the Boat Club plans. Speaking
to FELIX she said: "The Boat
Club do so well, they won
bronze at the Commonwealth
Games last year."
The decision to redevelop
the boat house was made 'many
years ago' according to Bill
Mason, College Waterman. He
told FELIX that the new facilities
were desperately needed, one of
the reasons being a 'big increase
in women's rowing'. The current
women's training area has been
dubbed 'barbaric' by a member
of the Governing Body.
Trouble may arise from the
Putney Society, a conservation
group that recognise the
importance of an aesthetically
pleasing landscape. College
authorities currently need to
convince the society that the
new building will not look out of
place with it's surroundings. It is
hoped that the building work
will start in May next year.
Mr Mason will be taking
sabbatical leave in the new year
for 6 months following his
appointment as Head Coach for
the Great Britain Women's
Squad. He stressed that although
he would not be at the club
when the appeal for funding was
being launched he was
'definitely not leaving' as the
club was 'his life'.
David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, spoke on Wednesday
at a meeting of Conservative Students, writes Rachel Walters. He talked in
bleak terms of the unhopeful short-term prospects for Northern Ireland, saying,
"the peace process is essentially bogus." Despite saying that there were 'causes
for optimism' he spoke of the crucial period next Easter by when the IRA is
said to expect major concessionsfromthe British government. He predicted
that the irreconcilable differences between the groups will become critical.
A Belated Happy Birthday from everyone at F E L I X to Sir
Ronald Oxburgh, 60 years old last Wednesday.
