In SScyberspace no-one can hear you type. And loneliness may be one of its
greatest drawbacks to lovers of group experiences, members of communities
and, well, lovers themselves. For what is the use, as Alice might ask, of a
trip across the surface of Mars with stunning pictures but no conversations?
Species of group experience Virtual Reality [UR] are currently making advances on
two fronts: in military simulations and in the entertainment industry. Neither, howev-
er, require that the user has anything but vile hatred for other humans who happen to
be present. Human intercourse is even absent in the seemingly benign idea of cybercy-
cling - using U
R simulations to make your daily stint on an exercise bicycle more inter-
esting. Wave to the virtual postman as you puff past! In the age of the office-at-home,
when we can access the world from our living room, we're going to value shared experi-
ence more than ever.
Cybersociety is gone to stay, for in the virtual world you're on your own.

^The Emaginator has recently fallen to
earth i n the Trocadero, Piccadilly Circus.
Touted as "a white-knuckle experience I
merging fantasy and reality", this sleek I
cyber experience is the closest that some should get to
vomit-inducing roller-coaster rides.
Punters descend to a pitch black room containing pods
which tip and judder i n synch with computer-generated
images. The experience of accidentally falling through a
black hole i n a space ship is not one you might expect
from an evening in the West End, but it's different.

student IHichael de Luna's
six months in the virtual
Reality industry left h i m
seriously enlightened.
Hilary forced some concrete facts out
of him.
Have you used all the bizarre U
K equipment you see in pic-
tures?
I've used several head mounted displays, which use two
screens to create stereo vision. Some of them still feel like
wearing a shoebox with the shoes still in it, though. I had a go
with the Dataglove, which enables you to pick up virtual
objects while i n SSimmersive D
R
. I've also worn a datasuit -
that was really, really embarrassing because it was made of
tight lycra.
Do you think that U
R will be as big as karaoke one day?
Yes. It's not as portable as karaoke, although there are people
working on portable U
R
. But I do think that U
R will become
more widespread through entertainment.
What did you think of Lawnmower Man?
I thought it sucked big. The graphics were crap and it gave a
very misconceived view of the capabilities of technology.
There's an idea that U
R sprang from the same people that were
into mind-altering drugs in the 60's, and I get the impression
that Steven K i n g played on that i n the story. I don't think
you can expand your mind by being subjected to UR.
W i l l completely SSimmersive U
R one day mean a convinc-
ing alternative universe?
Yes, in the future. Considering they haven't invented a decent
tactile feedback or olfactory technology yet, I think it'll be a
long time before we even approach alternative reality.
