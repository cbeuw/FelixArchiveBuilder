There's still time to catch the Royal
College of Art Society's exhibition
Paper Based in the Consort
Gallery, Sherfield Building. More
than two dozen artists are
represented and the pictures
range from pencil sketches to
large-scale collages. The styles
are pretty varied too, from eye-
crossing abstracts to School of
Athena trendy greetings cards.
Among the more unusual
items are designs by Ray Bradley
for stained glass at Southampton
University and the Mean Fiddler. L
J Wood's boy's head studies also
stand out, their depiction of
mutilated flesh recalling the war
etchings of Otto Dix.
Among the abstracts, there
are Brian de la Cour's queasy
'Necrosis' and three intriguing
paintings by Jim Field. Best of all
though, by a long brush-stroke,
are the three gorgeous mixed-
media abstracts by Clair Avery.
'Ice Shower', the exuberant 'Fresh
Water Trail', and in particular the
beautiful swirls and splodges of
'Player Bellota'. ©
The africa centre may not be the
obvious choice of venue, but the
Funkin' Pussy crowd have made
it one of the (allegedly) hottest
nights in town (could you resist the
name?).
DJs Hooch, Chris Johns & (top
man) Jasper the Vinyl Junkie
entertain a 'cool' crowd whose
intention is not social but serious
dancing. The guys at the desks are
deeply into the 'hot sh*t' they play
& if in need of entertainment,
focus on the DJ box & see those
boys move. Mm-mm. Not the
place for the uninitiated or those
who prefer up-tempo party funk,
but real p (for pure) funk lovers
need to be there. Only the
unintimidated need bother - the
door policy here isn't rich in warm
welcomes! The man-in-charge has
'No' as his favourite word and
helpful isn't his middle name. But
then, what does he care, he's
running the cheapest Saturday
night in town & he knows he's
sexy.
Go, if you dare, see it, do it &
most importantly, get the t-shirt
(everybody loves that logo).
Funkin' Pussy runs from 10
to 3 each Saturday at 38 King St
WC2 (Covent Garden). Drinks are
priced from £2.70 for beers and
soft drinks.
* and now a plea. Any
serious music lovers who want
some clubbing freebies please
come down to the F E L I X office
and see me especially about doing
indie, hardcore techno and hip
hop reviews. 0

This is where pop should be at.
Shampoo's 'we are shampoo' is
cheap, nasty and shallow.
Pink cd spines, 'imaginative'
album names and mindless hooks
disguise a Blur/Suede/Pulp lyrical
style; songs about romance -
"tacky and cheap, now the cliche's
complete" - the joys of travel -
"throwing up your kebab, in the
back seat of a taxi cab" - and
handsome strangers - "skinny
white thing, livin' in your own wet
dream" - give the proverbial finger
to Whitfield-esque dance in a big
way - "...supermodels' suck, riot
girls, diet girls, who really gives a
In a month or so you'll loathe
them with every inch of your soul,
but till then you might as well enjoy
a bit of fluff in your hifi once in a

Outtakes, b-sides, sessions, I
love them all if they come from the
ground where the smashing
pumpkins grow. You can even
provide a stupid title, like 'pisces
iscariot' and I'll go along for the
ride. Yeah this album maybe just a
filler of odds and ends as the
pumpkins clean out their old
drawers but that's doesn't mean it's
not good.
I don't normally have a
problem with this sort of venture
anyway. Personally I thought that
the Jesus and Mary Chain were as
good on 'barbed wire kisses' as
they were elsewhere. It's not a
generally held idea but the opening
line of 'sound of speed' proved it in
my book.
And here on 'pisces iscariot',
after the nominal opening track of
'soothe' which does that but
nothing else, we are in territory
which is twinned to 'siamese
dream'. In fact you get the feeling
that many of the lead guitar
sequences present could have been
straight transplants from 'silver-
f***k'.
There are also songs which
make you wonder why they're
there at all. For instance why
wasn't 'whir' grafted inbetween
sweet, sweet' and 'luna' on
'siamese dream', to create a free-
flow chill-out zone? Of course there
might not be any particular reason
and if there are that's why Billy
Corgan heads the group.
Still 'pisces iscariot' has more
than just novelty value going for it.
'blew away' and 'girl named
sandoz', for just two, should end up
as treasured as 'spaceboy', 'rocket',
'snail' and the rest. (7)
'Homegrown' by dodgy is the
second full-length album from a
band who are always being praised
by the nme [who? ed]. Although
I've never heard any of their music
before this, I now know why -
amazingly, they are better than
their hype.
Despite suffering from a
worrying marijuana and computer-
graphics obsession, which makes
the inside cover look more like a
rave flyer, they are definitely a rock
band. The album kicks off with the
jangly indie-pop of 'staying out for
the summer' and continues into
eleven sing-a-long songs (I kid you
not - pick any track from the album
and I promise you'll be able to hum
along in harmony). If you have ever
rapped your foot along the
Lemonheads, early Aerosmith, the
Beatles you'll love this seventies-
tinged, laid-back, lazy rock 'n' roll.
Retro, but not out of date. (9) 0
