'Everybody's Shakespeare', a multimedia
festival of all things Bardic, is taking over the
Barbican Centre for most of
November. The organisers have taken
the 'everybody' pretty seriously, and
are certainly trying to include people
who don't actually like Shakespeare.
There is a talk on Shakespeare's
language buried among the workshops,
exhibitions and free foyer events. But
mostly there's no need to grapple with
what for many people will be the
biggest turn-off: the text. Even the
plays to be performed during the
festival - five acclaimed productions
from abroad - will, with one exception,
be performed in foreign translations,
with surtitles.
Instead, the interactive sessions
are based freely on Shakespearian
characters and plots. The trouble is
that to get to them you first have to
interact with the Barbican Centre,
which is in the process of renumbering
all its floors. Hence the stalls floor is
now known as 'level -1, formerly level
3'. You'd think there'd been an
earthquake.
While the workshops are mainly
for children and teens, anyone even
remotely Shakespeare-literate will
We asked a random selection of IC students if they'd ever been to a Shakespeare play,
whether they could quote any of his lines, and if they thought that nowadays Shakespeare
should give way to more contemporary writers.
Pat Watson, Biochem
PG, has seen Macbeth
twice, "probably because
I'm Scottish". Her quote
was "Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend me
your ears," and she feels
that Shakespeare is "still
interesting from a literary
and historical point of
â€¢view".
Marc Strieker from Chem Eng is planning
to see his first Shakespeare
play, A Midsummer
Night's Dream, with
Artsoc soon. He gave us
"Is this a dagger I see
before me?", and he
believes "we should keep
up a little culture to stop
degeneration - look at all
the McDonald's and
throw-away products ".
Mohit Jain from Biochem
III has seen Macbeth.
Julius Ceasar and Pros-
pero's Books ("a bit too
way out"), and his quote
was (altogether now) "To
be or not to be, that is the
question." "There are so
many other good plays," he
feels, "such as Death of a
Salesman, which would
better acknowledge today's atmosphere."
Ilias Avdos, from
i Chem Eng III, came up
with a quote from
Romeo and Juliet,
having been to see it on a
school trip. "It was OK,

enjoy 'Whose iambic pentameter is it
anyway?', free in the foyer (Sat 12th Nov,
1.20-2.00pm, Sun 13th Nov, 12.30-1.15pm).
Actors improvise on Shakespearian
suggestions from the audience in scenes
veering (as this sort of thing does) between
the dire and the inspired. Lots of thees and
thous, and a few props including a skull for
the obligatory 'Alas poor Yorick' rip-off.
It's events like these that reveal the
wider importance of Shakespeare today; not
as a great writer but as part of our culture.
When a corpulent (male) actor says "I'm up
the duff, Romeo!", it has an extra dimension
of humour because it's subverting a serious,
established tradition we're all aware of. (And
for an example of how this can work the other
way, think of how many advertisers have
invoked Shakespeare to add the impression of
quality and depth to their products.)
This is something which a display in
one of the Barbican foyers acknowledges
when it says, "If Shakespeare hadn't existed, it
would have been necessary to invent him."
Which, indeed, is exactly what some people
claim did happen. Sir Francis Bacon? Queen
Elizabeth I? The latest computer-aided
research has turned up a surprising new
candidate for the authorship of Shakespeare's
plays: find out who on level 0 at the Barbican
Centre, until November 27th.
How to be Bottom
There's more computer aided learning going
on in the Concourse Gallery. 'Shakespeare's
Bottom, a hands-on experience'? Some
mistake, thinkest thou? But nay, 'tis merely
that thou hast a filthy imagination, as this is
the Midsummer Night's Dream interactive
exhibition, more to do with Bottom the
weaver than the Bard's behind. Dozens of
computer programmes enable you to do
things like produce music from Shakes-
pearian instruments, cast a Puckish spell,
design an Elizabethan newspaper and make
up a poster for the play. (We try this one: out
of the corner of my eye I see an enormous
Shakespeare rampaging out of control across
tintin's screen.) Unfortunately there's no
facility for printing out your handiwork.
Mechanicals, rude and otherwise, can
put together a miniature stage set, twang a
dulcimer and conjure sound effects from an
exotic selection of percussion instruments.
We soothe our furrow'd brows with surf
noises from an Amazonian rain-stick.
The part children seemed to be
enjoying most was a curtain maze-cum-forest
which they could rush in and out of dressed
in green capes. I don't know how much it was
teaching them about Shakespeare though. B
