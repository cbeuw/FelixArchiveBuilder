Incoming
Questionnaire... CCLTs in
The Question?
News Response
Edited this week by Owain
Bennallack, the Editor (!)
I am sure that most of years 2 & 3
saw the pretty pink (for girls)
questionnaire on sexual
harassment that appeared in
common rooms last year. What I
would like to know is why the
questionnaire was only for girls. I
realise that, as a male student was
expelled last year for this reason, it
was a topic on many people's
minds, but in this case our
esteemed women's officer was a
little misguided.
No one would deny that
sexual harassment does exist and
women can be especially
vulnerable to unwanted sexual
overtures. However, it is not
women in general that suffer most
from sexual harassment, it is shy
people, those who feel they cannot
confront their harasser, both male
and female. I am deliberate
discounting those women who
view any contact with men with
extreme prejudice. After all, if you
look for something hard enough,
you will at least find an
approximation of it.
To be honest, I consider the
sexual harassment of men by
women to be far worse, as women
will not admit that they are
capable of going too far, they are
less likely to be punished for their
actions and male victims of
harassment have to suffer in
silence. Male students have no
men's officer to go to and their
friends, both male and female, are
less likely to be supportive in these
circumstances. At best, male
victims should be flattered by the
attention and, at worst, they are to
consider it a minor nuisance.
Nor do I think that sexual
harassment of women is
widespread. In my experience,
when women are uncommon, they
are treated with deference, and
what would forfeit any chance of a
career for the sake of upsetting a
woman? In my opinion, most
male harassers are either
obsessive and should be helped,
not punished, or they genuinely
have not realised that they are
upsetting the object of their
attentions. Before anyone reports
someone for sexual harassment
they should at least try to tell their
harasser to stop. You never know,
it might work. I
f Imperial College
wants to be seen to be taking a
stand on this issue, why is it only
taking into consideration what may
even be a minority of victims of
harassment? In my opinion, the
survey was conducted in a sexist
manner and was, quite frankly,
insulting to the whole idea of
feminism. If women are
continually portrayed as helpless
victims then we will always be
treated as inferior or with kid
gloves. Why should we be treated
as second-rate members of society.
In the same way, why should we
have special treatment? Please, if
there is going to be any more
surveys of this type, can they be
across the board.

/ thought much the same
although I disagree with the
implication that men 'suffer' equally
with women. Several women I
know have had problems: no men
yet. Certainly, the only people to
have been desperate enough to
ever hassle me have been male. But
your last comment is spot on. The
'victim' mentality seems to ghettoise
many minorities and thus
compounds the problem. What
does everyone else think? Anyone
fancy writing an article?
Thorny Matter
Dear Felix,
We would like to comment on
the article on the front cover of
Felix 1009, reporting on the RSM
Freshers' Dinner. Two points in the
article in particular attracted our
attention; first, the reference to last
year's accident in Evelyn Gardens,
which was tactless and
unnecessary, and second, the
allegations of 'widespread spiking
of drinks'.
Last year, as a result of the
accident, the ICU president and
CCU Presidents had several
meetings with the Deputy Rector,
as the college were concerned
about 'institutionalised drinking' at
Imperial.. A set of guidelines were
agreed on, which included
advertising guidelines and conduct
at events. The Presidents agreed
that spiking of drinks would be
outlawed at dinners, so that every
person would be aware of exactly
what they were drinking. At ALL
Freshers' Dinners, the hosts made
sure that the guidelines were
followed, and anyone was free to
stop alcohol consumption at any
point they wished to. There was
certainly not 'widespread spiking
of drinks' at the RSM dinner. This
has been confirmed by the C&GCU
President, the Mary's President,
and the RCSU Vice-President who
were present at the dinner. The
article put the RSMU in a very bad
light, and may well cause
repercussions with College.
We all fully support the
guidelines agreed by our
predecessors, and will continue to
make sure that they are adhered
to at events in the future.

I have to disagree with your
statement that the reference to last
years article was 'tactless and
unnecessary'. News articles should
attempt to contextualise the subject
and the comment was discretely
placed at the bottom of the article.
If the article has put the RSMU in a
bad light then that is unfortunate
but we must report the news as it
comes to us. I personally support
your stance on drink-spiking and
trust you will continue to make
every attempt to prevent it in the
future.
Fundamental
Mistakes
Dear Felix,
Upon reading "Fundamental
Differences" by David Cohen, I felt
it was appropriate for the Islamic
Society to comment about the
contents of the article. I want to
address two issues implied by the
piece, namely the labelling of
'muslim activists' and in particular
Hizb ut Tahrir as propagators of
racist ideas and indirectly linking
Imperial College Islamic Society
with the named muslim
organisation (
I have deliberately
not discussed the other concerns
raised in the article, for the sake of
brevity).
It is clear that the author is not
well versed in Islam, for it is
untenable for any muslim
organisation to propagate racism,
as such an attitude is in clear
contradiction to the teachings of
Islam.
Allah (the Lord and only God
worthy of worship) says in His final
revelation to mankind, the Quran
"O Mankind! Indeed, we have
created you male and female, and
have made you nations and tribes
that you may know one another.
Indeed, the noblest of you in the
sight of Allah, is the best in
conduct. Verily, Allah is the all-
knowing the all-[...]"
[Chapter 49 Verse 1 3]
Islam can never be accused of
racism, as Allah clearly states the
only criteria by which one person is
better than another is by virtue of
their belief in Allah and good
actions. It may be surprising to
note that during our 'Take a Look
at Islam' week at the beginning of
term, our guest speakers included
an english speaker, two afro-
caribbean speakers and a french
speaker.
My second point is to clarify
that the Islamic Society has no
affiliation and nor is it a front for
Hizb ut Tahrir. Both the Islamic
Society and Hizb ut Tahrir consists
of muslims, the bond in faith
implies that we join and propagate
whatever Islam deems to be good
and therefore beneficial to society
at large.
Finally, "Fundamental
Differences", did not attempt to
explain what and why are there
fundamental differences between
Islam and other ways of life, rather
it attempted to paint a negative of
'muslim activist' and Islam in
general. The Islamic Society has
always been open to questions,
dialogue and even debate
concerning all aspects of life.
However no-one can tolerate
unfounded accusations.
Yours sincerely,
Junaid Sheikh
Islamic Society Vice President
Thank you for the feedback
Junaid. To be brief, the article itself
did not accuse anyone of racism: it
reported that ULU have, however,
passed a motion banning literature
which breaks its constitution and
that the Hizb ut Tahrir literature, in
their opinion, does. The FELIX
author's opinion and knowledge of
Islam shouldn't be relevant. Your
photocopy of your letter you
submitted chopped off some text so
I have had to include '[•••]' rather
than misquote the Quran.
Letters may be commented on
by a guest editor whose
opinions are not neccesarily
those of the editor and cut due
to space restrictions.
Deadline: Monday 6.00pm.
