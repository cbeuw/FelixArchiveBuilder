Imperial
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Imperial College is considering
assisting in the establishment of
a science and technology
institution in Thailand.
Though the Management
School has had formal links with
Singapore since 1987, a new
proposal, set up by a former IC
student, Dr Viphandh
Roengpithya, is at a college-wide
consultation stage, seeing
whether it fits in with IC's
objectives.
Dr Timothy Seller, Director
of International and School's
Liaison, said Thailand was
"rapidly developing with
enormous potential. I think that
the person who has made the
proposal is a good egg ... the idea
is more philanthropic than
commercial, but obviously it
would have to make ends meet."
The idea has been around
for some time and is being
carefully considered. "The
Imperial College alumni are very
strong, we've got some big boys
out there [who are] very
prestigious people." He added
that IC has already been
involved with a few Thai
universities, working on staff
development projects, research
links, and consulting schemes.
"This initiative is the latest and
largest ... this is the first really
SE Asia
concrete proposal that has come
forward ... It's not a pie in the
sky idea."
Whilst some members of
staff, including heads of
departments, were interested in
the project, some had also
expressed concern that
involvement with a lesser
institution would lead to a drop
in standards. "We won't
compromise our reputation,"
Sellers said.
Mr. Peter Mee, College
Registrar, stressed that the
future of the idea was dependant
on the level of staff support for
the project. "The Rector is
seeking as wide a reaction as
possible [to the idea] ... but it's
still being talked about. It's a
question of gauging enth-
usiasm", he said. As for the
award of qualifications, it would
not award IC degrees as "we
don't award degrees anyway ...
and there's no suggestion of the
University of London being
involved." The intention, he
added, was to set up an
institution whose standards
mirrored that of IC, but the
whole scheme is "not cut and
dried ... it could be picked up, it
could be dropped."
The minutes of the Board
of Studies, which has been
looking into the idea, are due to
be published within the week.
Mrs Elaine Taylor, Administer
in the Kobler Unit, died from
cancer on October 16th.
She joined the college in
January 1980, initially in the
Department of Electrical
Engineering and later of
Computing. She worked for
Professor Robert Spence, later
for Professor Igor Aleksander
(Foundation Kobler Professor of
the management of Information
Technology), subsequently
became Head of Department's
Secretary in Computing and
finally moved to the centre
Cognitive systems.
As Secretary to Professor
Sayers, Dean of City and Guilds
College 1984-88 and 19991-93,
she became a great friend of the
Union and of its officers, and
was well known throughout the
college. Her recent funeral in
Salisbury was attended by a
number of academic, technical,
administrative and general staff
and both past and present
students and Union Officers, and
there have been donations in her
memory from several groups of
College staff to Imperial Cancer
Research - her chosen charity.
Unleaded Chaos
BY MICHAEL L U D L A M
A Professor from Imperial
College has run into a storm of
criticism this week for the
evidence he gave to a Commons
Select Committee.
Professor Roger Perry, Head
of the Centre of Environmental
Control and Waste Management
in the Civil Engineering
Department, gave evidence at the
Transport Select Committee. His
department is funded by Octel, a
company that sells lead additives
for petrol. The report, released
last week, called for a ban on
super unleaded petrol and an
urgent inquiry into the use of
unleaded petrol in cars not fitted
with catalytic converters. It
claimed that unleaded car fuel
produces much higher levels of
benzene than leaded.
When F E L I X contacted
Professor Perry he stated that all
of his interests had been declared
before the hearings had started.
He was more evasive when asked
about his involvement with
Octel replying that he was, "not
prepared to discuss that". He
continued: "we have a college
where sixty percent of our
income comes from industry,
research contracts and research
projects. Octel was one of
them." F E L I X spoke to Fiona
Weir of Friends of the Earth who
said that she didn't "think the
transport committee should
generally use advisers linked to
commercial companies." Ms
Weir stressed that if such links
were unavoidable, then they
should endeavour to get a balance
of people with outside interests.
The chemical at the centre
of this argument is benzene, a
Class A genotoxic carcinogen. In
order to increase the octane
number, super unleaded contains
more benzene, and more
aromatics, which produce more
benzene when burnt than
normal leaded and unleaded
petrol. This was deemed 'highly
unacceptable' by Professor Perry
He added that the idea that super
unleaded was a super green fuel
was the 'biggest con of all time'.
It is widely accepted that
super unleaded fuel should be
banned. "We have no problems
on a call for a ban on super
unleaded", said Fiona Weit, "it
makes a lot of sense."
F E L I X tried to talk to
Octel but they declined to
comment. Fiona Weir said, "It is
our view that the reason Octel is
pushing this area is not
primarily due to the U K debate,
but because of their concern to
protect sales of lead and lead
additives in developing country
markets."
Professor Perry's view is
that lead should be eliminated
from petrol and catalysts be used.
