Ultra Vires Again
It seems M r Passmore read my editorial last
week — but unfortunately, he has missed the
point. I should point out that affiliation to W U S
(World University Service) is not Ultra Vires,
as it is an "educational" organisation, which is
a l l o w e d u n d e r t h e l a w . M r P a s s m o r e
suggested at I C U Council that I had suggested
that affiliation to W U S was Ultra Vires; I admit
that connotation could be placed on what I
wrote but all I intended was to liken the W U S
collections at U G M s to a possible collection
for affiliation fee that would otherwise be Ultra
Vires. It amazes me that M r Passmore should
read my editorial and only find that point worth
c o m m e n t i n g on. If he h a d read with the
intelligence I realise we must have to obtain an
h o n o u r s d e g r e e he w o u l d k n o w I w a s
suggesting m u c h more than that. A g a i n ,
anything for the easy life and a little bitch at
F E L I X , eh John?
Thanks to . . . .
Patrick, Martin, Andy, Phil, T i m , Shanne,
Dave, Paul, Pallab, Steve, Zar, Ian and M a z .
Happy Easter everyone. G o o d luck in your
eggzams next term.

Bookshop News
You will all be pleased (?) to hear that all 1980
E x a m Papers are now with the Heads of
Departments and not sold by the Bookshop.
Mike Kidron, the author of State of the World
Atlas, gave a very interesting talk o n the
background to his book last Friday and despite
the small audience, he will be coming back during
the autumn. The book is still available from the
Bookshop, priced £5.95.
O N FRIDAY N I G H T there is a Rag Disguise
Party in the J C R . Tickets are 50p each and are
available in the Guilds Office.
Some time in the first two weeks of next term
there will be IC Games — the annual inter-CCU
sports competition. Anyone willing to run, hurdle,
pole vault, throw things or spectate should be able
to get more details in the Guilds Office. I'm sorry 1
can't give you a date or anything, but it has not
been organised (at the time of writing).
By the way, Dave "Duncan Goodhew" Gayer's
21st birthday is on April 2, but he doesn't want
anyone to know about it.

Nightline Moves
N E W S F L A S H : NIGHTLINE is moving during the
Easter holidays from 10 Princes Gardens to the
basement of 9 Princes Gardens.
Jo Student: "So what's that got to do with me?"
Fred Bloggs: "Isn't that where you phone when
you're just about to leap off Battersea Bridge?"
Well, contrary to popular belief, Nightline has a
lot more to offer than that. We have heaps of
information available, ranging from what time the
last bus is, where a film is showing, where you can
go for a meal at 2:00am, gay events, what's on in
all the W London colleges, as well as information
on contraception, V D , etc., etc., etc.
Nightline is run by students for students, and is
open each night from 6:00pm to 9:00am, so why
not drop down to "the basement" after Easter for
a cup of coffee and a chat — we promise not to
bite, preach or psychoanalyse and the coffee's
even quite decent. Or, why not phone — the
number remains the same as before — 581 2468
or internal 2468.
Each S U from the W London colleges help to
finance Nightline, so why not get your money's
worth?
