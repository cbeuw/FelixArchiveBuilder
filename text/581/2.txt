I was disgusted with last week's
F E L I X (no 580) and dissociate
myself from it entirely. It was a
disgrace to the whole College and
brought shame on the office you
bear as E d i t o r . D e s p i t e y o u r
persistent efforts, you were not
elected to drag our newspaper
down to all-time low standards,
r e g a r d l e s s of w h e t h e r these
s t a n d a r d s are y o u r o w n : you
were elected to be Editor to the
"newspaper of Imperial College
U n i o n " .
In your editorial last week you
expressed the belief that "the
m a j o r i t y of s t u d e n t s e n j o y
reading the kind of F E L I X (you)
enjoy producing" — you were
obviously neglecting your capa-
city to offend the decency of most
people when selecting the front
cover. Y o u also seem to have
"forgotten" the outrage, hurt
and infuriat ion you have purposely
caused in past issues. It seems to
have been your policy to cause
sensations of the most distasteful
kind, without any regard to the
means employed and, in particu-
lar, to the persons maligned.
I sincerely hope that y o u r
successor pursues a more satis-
factory editorial policy, which,
under the regrettable circum-
stances, could hardly be difficult.
I also trust that he may be able to
repair some of the substantial
damage you have caused during
your unfortunate tenure of office.

Sir
T h e irony of your headline
over such a disgusting picture
( F E L I X 580) o n l y reinforces
evidence that if F E L I X had any
credibility left within I C or the
p u b l i c at l a r g e after r e c e n t
editorials, it has surely vanished
now.
Even if the C N D campaign
successfully removed a l l weapons
from the face of the earth, Britain
w i l l e v e n t u a l l y c r i p p l e itself
with its immorality and godless-
ness. M a n y countries survive war
— but none survive once gripped
by immorality. M a r y Whitehouse
is a courageous, and far-sighted
lady. She has courage which puts
many men to shame.
The Bible says " T h e fear ol
G o d is the beginning ol wisdom",
and M a r y Whitehouse is a wise
lady indeed. She often stands
alone in her fight to keep filth out
of the media and though she will
be ridiculed by mankind, she is
certain ol commendation from
God: " i l you suffer as a Christian,
do not be ashamed, but praise
G o d that you bear that Name.
. For it is time lor judgement to
begin with the family of G o d ;
and if it begins with us, what will
the outcome be far those who do
not obey the Gospel of G o d ? "
The fool will say in his heart
"there is no G o d " so that he can
i n d u l g e in i m m o r a l i t y . T h e
Christian, however, has a glori-
ous hope and purpose in living.
W e do not place ourselves above-
anyone else, but we proclaim
what we know to be true. The
word of G o d is the truth about
man, and I personally believe
and stake my life on what H e
says, from Genesis, to Revela-
tions.

Sir
I would like to make it clear
that I am not the author of the
letter from Eric the Mutilated
C a m e l in last week's F E L I X . I
a m n e i t h e r a r t i o d a c t y l n o r
m u t i l a t e d , a n d t h o u g h I a m
known as " E r i c " , it is merely a
nickname, hence the quotation
marks. I agree with the contents
ol the letter and was revolted by
the ill-informed, malicious and
dare I say, unchristian attack
made on M r Marshall by that
r e t r o m i n g e n t , s e m i - s e n t i e n t ,
simian D a v i d Vinnegar. Despite
this I do not believe in filling
F E L I X ' s letters page with abuse,
even on subjects as tempting as
i g n o r a n t a n d l o n g w i n d e d as
Dennis Vinnegar.
I do not like people leaning out
of Linstead Extension windows
a c c u s i n g me of w r i t i n g such
trivial, abusive and tedious drivel
and so, I repeat, I am not Erie
the Mutilated C a m e l .
I am Sir,

Dear Sieve
I w o u l d l i k e to use y o u r
columns to reply to the accusa-
t i o n s l e v e l l e d at me by the
L a b o u r C l u b in last week's
F E L I X . In reply to M r R
Alexander and M r G u n a w a r -
dena's letter, I would like to
point out that I do know what I
said. The topic of debate with M r
P r i c e was w h e t h e r to s e n d
t a l e n t e d c h i l d r e n to s p e c i a l
schools or comprehensives which,.
I said, " w o u l d reduce them to the
level ol simian morons like y o u "
(and I have at least one other
witness to bear me out on this). I
can only conclude that you either
genuinely misheard what I said
at the time or that you have
deliberately chosen to misquote
me. In the former case, I will
apologise to you lor any offence
caused with the proviso that you
apologise firstly for the libellous
comments that you wrote last
week. In the latter case, all I can
advise you to do is 'Go forth and
multiply' in half as many words.
Concerning M r Kellerman's
letter I would like to state firstly
that I am not a Tory propagan-
dist. Secondly, the report was not
a criticism of the L a b o u r C l u b
but rather a comment on the
s p e a k e r — h a d M r C a r l i s l e
chosen to make the numerous
rash comments that his counter-
part made, I would not have
hesitated in criticizing him. I do
feel however that the report was
too subjective and my apologies
to anyone who found the humour
in anyway distasteful.
fours sincerely

Dear Sir
W i t h reference to M r Bedding's
letter last week ( F E L I X 580)'. I
w o u l d like to t h a n k h i m for
conceding that his article was a
subjective report — it w o u l d
h a v e been w o r r y i n g h a d he
claimed his opinions were the
true facts.
The point ol'his letter appeared
to be that " B i r Zeit's existence is
being threatened" by the Israelis.
T h i s statement, c o m i n g from
s o m e o n e a w a r e of the facts,
amazes me. As M r Bedding is
well aware (I'm assuming he was
at the meeting his original article
advertised) Bir Zeit and the other
three universities on the West
Bank were created by the Israeli
Parliament. Surely the setting up
of educational institutions such as
these is an act of peace in itself
a n d t h e r e f o r e c o u l d not be
considered the action of a hostile
government. The answer is self-
evident.
lours sincerely

Dear Comrade Editor
Once again I see the C a m -
p a i g n l o r N a t i o n a l D i s a s t e r
( C N D ) has been rearing its ugly
bead on your pages. This dis-
gusted, or perhaps d i s g u s t i n g
comrade has obviously never left
the lower echelon of the Physics
department.
Does he seriously believe that
the enormous Soviet presence/
domination in Eastern Europe is
purely decorative, and that the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
was purely a Christmas present
for President Brezhnev.
The Soviet threat, comrades, is
there and real, and we must light
to contain it. O u r freedom is
more important than the ego
trips of v a r i o u s politicos w h o
would probably state that the
U S A was a greater enemy to
democracy than the U S S R just
to gain a bit of cheap publicity.
W e must fight hard against
these individuals who wish to rob
us of our national pride and
identity. Freedom, comrades, is
the only thing worth fighting for.
.No surrender

Dear Sir
T h e f i n a l s e c t i o n of y o u r
editorial last week left me with a
cold feeling in my stomach. Being
quite sure that you would not
publish information which you
knew to be untrue, I can only
assume that you have hired a
group of people to follow me
about and monitor my move-
ments from day to day. I used to
leave the curtains in my room
open most of the time, but it
seems this will have to change.
But, Steve I'm afraid your team
of private detectives has passed
y o u s o m e t h i n g less t h a n the
truth. I have spent some fifteen
hours of my time on w r i t i n g
things for The Phoenix this term
a l o n e , a n d the l a c k of s a i d
material in the editor's hands is
d u e to s e l f - c r i t i c i s m . S e l l -
criticism is not of course a subject
I w o u l d expect you to k n o w
much about.
