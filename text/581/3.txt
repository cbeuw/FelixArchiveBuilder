Small Ads Council Report
ICU Council had a turgid and acrimonious meeting on Monday
evening. The meeting discussed FELIX finances, OSC
finances, the Union response to Swinnerton Dyer, and a
motion of criticism in the three sabbatical officers.
The meeting opened shortly after 6:00pm, and under matters arising
from the minutes of the last meeting, J o h n Passmore suggested that a n
editorial remark in F E L I X suggesting that the affiliation to W U S was
u n c o n s t i t u t i o n a l was i n c o r r e c t . J o n F i r t h , P u b l i c a t i o n s B o a r d
C h a i r m a n , outlined some of the reasons offered for F E L I X expenditure
during the year.
T h e Deputy President stated that the H O S T library will stay in the
same place as before. O n L o n d o n Student Travel, she outlined
proposals from the non-student directors to remove the student
directors from the Board.
In the H o n See's report it was suggested that the ballot papers i n
single transferable vote elections should contain voting instructions.
T h e H o n Sec mentioned a film " N o t T o n i g h t " , which illustrates some
problems of students would be shown if enough interest developed in it.
T h e O S C C h a i r m a n ' s report was referred back, a n d a full
breakdown financial situation (£200 in the red) was asked for.
The meeting then discussed a motion to Council from Publications
Board which criticised the Deputy President, Rachel Snee. M a r k
Smith, F E L I X Editor-elect, spoke to the motion, which was in reply to
a previous motion at the last Council which condemned " i n the
strongest possible terms" the way money had been misspent by F E L I X
stall, on office furnishings, refreshments a n d Conference fees. T h e
motion was discussed thoroughly, w i t h contributions c o m i n g i n
particular from M a r k Clegg. R a e Snee spoke against the motion, a n d
defended her action at the last Council. T h e whole matter revolved
around, firstly, the Editor sanctioning payment for equipment during
the summer a n d at other times, without proceeding through the
correct channels, a n d secondly, the Deputy President bringing the
matter to Council's attention when it should have been dealt with in
the committee of first instance, namely Publications Board, a n d
without informing the accused of the original C o u n c i l motion so they
could be present to advocate their side of the case. T h e motion
criticising R a e Snee was passed. (The original motion put to Council by Rae
Snee was not reported in FELIX as Mark Smith had complained to the Elections
Committee that it biased the election - Ed.)
M a r k Clegg, presenting the P W P report, said they were looking into
having a woman's rep on PVVP. Barney M c C a b e suggested a Gaysoc
rep and a yellow trousers rep, but after discussion from M r Clegg M r
M c C a b e revealed that he had not been quite serious i n his suggestion.
P W P was also looking into student representation on Joint College
Committees.
T h e meeting went into closed session. W h e n it was reopened to
observers, it was agreed to ask the Handbook Editor to extend the copy
deadline to the end of the first week of term.
In answer to a question, J o h n Passmore said that he expected bar
prices to remain down until next term.
The meeting then discussed the Union's reponse to the Swinnerton-
Dyer report a n d asked lor a redrafting of a statement presented to
Council.
When everyone thought the meeting was drawing to a close. Bob
Bradley. Academic Affairs Officer, proposed a motion of censure in this
year's three sabbatical officers, for not bringing next year's estimates to
Council's attention before they were submitted to College. R a e Snee
had lelt the meeting. J o h n Passmore felt he had done nothing wrong,
and L i z Lindsay said it was policy not to photocopy more than twenty
sheets of anything. Nick M o r t o n , I C U President-elect, said he would
resign if he was placed in a similar situation next year. J e n H a r d y -
Smith said it would mean more work for the permanent staff, if the full
estimates were presented at the meeting. It was emphasised that the
estimates were updated as recently as Friday, with the additional
further claims. M r Bradley, who referred to the I C U Blue Book during
his submissions, altered the motion to one of reprimand. T h e meeting
\oted 7-11 not to pass the motion. After further minor points, the
unsettled meeting closed.
Informed sources told F E L I X M o n d a y night that Miss Lindsay
later said sin- would have resigned if the original motion had been
cat tied.

Hayman Named
Sir P e t e r H a v i i i a n . R O M S ,
C Y O , M B E . was named yester-
day in a Parliamentary Question
as the ex-diplomat involved in
the paedophile case.
F E L I X a n d Private Eye named
Sir Peter as long ago as J a n u a r y

residence where a number of I C
students reside.
170 Picket
A P I C K E T of Governing Bodv
was held outside 170 Queens-
gate, the Rector's residence, last
Friday morning. About twenty
students were present to hand out
leaflets to C o l l e g e G o v e r n o r s
before the meeting concerning
South African students o n the
nuclear fuels technology course.
Students on the picket told
F E L I X that a member of the
Governing Body told the students
that there m a y well have been
more support for them amongst
the Governors than would have
been shown on any voting. T h e
issue of South African students on
the course is likely to come up
again at Board of Studies on M a y
6, and a petition to be presented
to the Board. ( A petition form

Brontosaurus Blues, performed in a
musical evening i n 53 Princes
Gate last Friday. T h e song, a
catchy unaccompanied S A T B *
with male lead ditty, was well
received, a n d M r M c C a b e was
pleased with the W o r l d Premiere
performance. However, he d i d
not mention any plans to go
professional as a songwriter.

Man v Machine
O N T U E S D A Y , M a r c h 10,
seven members of the Chess C l u b
took on seven electronic oppo-
nents: N A S C O M , Pets a n d the
College main-frame.
T w o of the computers, perhaps
rather shy of their first public
appearance didn't want to start;
M M e C a l l ' s opponent, a rather
temperamental Nascom, twice
suffered from a nervous break-
d o w n d u r i n g m i d - g a m e . T h e
computer on board 1 lost to a
b l i n d f o l d e d p l a y e r i n twelve
moves, whilst the College C D C
lost its queen a n d rook in 8.
" T h e y ' r e c r a p ! " C a p t a i n of of
the m a g n i f i c e n t seven c o m -
mented after inllicting a crushing
13:1 defeat on the computers.
The only person to lose was
playing blindfolded and was two
pieces up when he resigned out of
boredom.
W h e n F E L I X asked the M i c r o -
c o m p u t i n g C l u b a b o u t t h i s
abysmal failure, the only replies
received were " w e l l , mine didn't
work", " a h come o n ! " and "just
wait till next time".
