MINERS
MINUS
MASCOT
In a daring night-time raid on the Mines Building on Tuesday
night, the RCS mascotry group succeeded in violating Davy, the
Mines mascot.
At a press conference called at 1:30am on Wednesday morning, R i c h
Archer issued the following statement.
"Following discreet observation at the R o y a l School of Mines
Election U G M last Tuesday, the location of the Mines mascot, Davy,
was ascertained by the R o y a l College of Science U n i o n mascotry team,
otherwise known as Montysoc. Later that night, the location was
visited by the R C S team, and the mascot was removed from the
building with negligible damage. Afterwards, it was whisked away to a
secret destination. Ransom details will be issued to the R o y a l School of
Mines U n i o n next term.
Have a nice Davy.
R i c h Archer and Paul Johnson"
O n Wednesday morning more information was given to F E L I X by
an anonymous team member.
For the last five years, there has been a substantial amount of
research carried out by R C S U , observing Mines U G M s and picking
up clues. After the Election U G M last Tuesday the team decided to
make a raid that evening. A group of between five and ten people from
the R C S M e t a l Collection and Appreciation Society affected an entry
to a locker in a first floor room in the Mines Building (Davey was also
taken from this location the last time it was violated by Guilds). The
group went outside and placed D a v y in the R C S J 4 , and it was
removed to an undisclosed destination. T h e whole operation took only
twelve minutes. O n the way out, the group was spotted by night
security, but no one remained to explain what was going on.
T h e C h i e f Security Officer, M r Reeves, spoke to F E L I X on
Wednesday afternoon. H e realised that violating D a v y was probably
the stunt of the year, but the students should have told the guard what
was happening. Part of a security guard's job would be to apprehend
people making off with brass fitments, he added. Students on this kind
of stunt should think more about the consequences of their actions.
Mines U n i o n have not at this stage, made any official comment to
F E L I X , although rumours have been circulated suggesting R C S U
have got the wrong Davy. R C S U deny this resolutely.

Dauy's forerunner, Davy pictured with a newspaper the last time it was
violated, in 1974. This is the first time that the present Davy has been
violated.
Cunning Stunts
• The relationship between I C and Chelsea has deteriorated since I C
pulled out of N U S and Chelsea broke off the reciprocal arrangements.
Last week, students had tried to kidnap Rae Snee, but were trounced
by M s Snee, and a companion. O n Thursday evening students arrived
at I C Radio's studios beneath Southside. C l a i m i n g to be on a Chelsea
rag stunt, they occupied the studio and tried to get " o n the a i r " .
Fortunately, the Station Manager, Dave Fuller, was able to take the
station off the air so as to stop listeners being offended by crudities from
non-IC students. College security and police arrived to remove the
invaders from the premises.
O n Friday afternoon students arrived at the Guilds U n i o n Office,
claiming to be on a rag stunt from Barts. They untruthfully said there
was a skirmish between Guilds and Barts students outside. M r Gayer
was accompanied outside by Guilds persons (who outnumbered the
C h e l s e a / Q E C raggers) when he went to investigate. Outside was a van,
into which it had been intended to bundle Dave. But for the Guilds
stalwarts it seems likely Dave would have been 'nabbed'.
At the same time as this, yet more students on a rag stunt arrived at
the R C S U Olfice intending to remove Barney M c C a b e and Phil Thomas.
They firstly asked for some signs from the R C S U Office but these were
refused. Then the two victims were taken outside and put in a red
transit van.
They were taken to Chelsea and then to Q E C . Steve Tyson. R C S
H o n Sec, telephoned Q E C to explain that a " r a n s o m " would not be
paid. After this, Messrs M c C a b e and Thomas were locked in a
downstairs room at Q E C . However, there was another exit from the
room, namely an unlocked door which they were told not to try. It did
not take long for the intrepid two to figure out an escape and return to
I C in a taxi. Q E C had intended to publicly humilate the I C students
on Saturday's joint Q E C / C h e l s e a rag procession to end their rag week.
The tables were successfully turned however, when a group of I C
students arrived at the procession and pelted everyone with 151bs of
flour. H i p ! H i p !
