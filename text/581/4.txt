Preamble
Welcome to the Easter puzzle eggstravaganza! Steve
asked me to make it topical, with lots of eggscruciating
puns, so how could I refuse?
As with the Christmas issue, the unmarked puzzles are
for amusement only, whereas the sworded ones each have
a £ 2 prize, awarded for the correct solution randomly
selected at 1:00pm on Wednesday April 29th. In addition
for the person who answers most prize puzzles correctly,
there is a cash bonus of£2, plus a £ 1 0 voucher redeemable
at Mend-a-Bike. Many thanks to Pete and Will, the
managers of Mend-a-Bike, for their generosity in giving
this prize
Thanks too to Grey Spider for the chess puzzle (again) and
to a new contributor, JAIT, for the cross-number.
Sorry about the 'catch' in last week's puzzle, but I
thought that as it's getting on for April 1st, I should be
allowed a few liberties. You can rest assured that there's
nothing as sneaky as that irr this batch.
Because this page is going to press before the
competition deadline, the winner's name is in Steve's
editorial (if he remembers).
Answers to sworded puzzles, as usual, to me c/o FELIX
Office. The correct solutions to all the puzzles will appear
in the first FELIX of next term.
Finally good luck with the puzzles, enjoy a relaxing
Passiontiae, and may your egg-cup run over.
Scaramouche.

The answer to each clue is a binary number. Where the clue
letter applies both to a horizontal and a vertical number, the
answer is the same in each case. All numbers are positive
integers with no leading zeros.
