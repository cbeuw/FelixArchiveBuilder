The Shape of
Things to Come
by next year's editor
The retiring editor has kindly donated the
space to me in order to express my plans for
the coming year. I would like to outline the
major events in chronological order.
PG FEUX
There will be one P G F E L I X only on Friday,
August 7. Copy deadline for that issue will be
Wednesday, July 29.
I hope to spend a great deal of time over the
summer preparing feature articles for the
coming year, which I feel are greatly needed.
This means that I will only have time for one
issue, so I hope you do not take this as an early
sign of laziness.
If any of you P G s have some bright ideas for
articles then please come in and see me. I'd
like to see a lot of work by you in this issue.
Freshers' FELIX
Copy deadline for the Freshers' FELIX is
Wednesday, September 23. Please ensure that
any articles reach the office, by that date. I
cannot guarantee inclusion of any piece, but
shall consider each on their merits as space is
limited.
I would like to remind the publicity officers
of clubs and societies that I do not want a
repetition of Handbook articles. Your articles
s h o u l d only include news of recruitment
events and the activities of the first few weeks.
I would also like to remind those people who
were too lazy or inefficient to contribute their
articles to the Handbook that they will not be
given an opportunity to use Freshers' F E L I X
as a substitute.
RCS Centenary
There will be a special issueonFriday, November
27 to celebrate the R C S Centenary, which will
coincide with the Centenary Ball. This will
include a history of the R C S and also any other
interesting items I can find.
FEUX 600th Issue
All being well, the six-hundredth issue of
F E L I X will be on Friday, December 11. This
will hopefully be a bumper Christmas number
too and will include articles on the foundation
and history of FELIX.
Imperial College 75th Anniversary
This takes place in July 1982. I have no plans
as yet.
Puzzle from Last Edition
Solutions
The solution to the last puzzle should be self-
e x p l a n a t o r y . T h e p r i z e w i n n e r is A d r i a n
Tottenham, C h e m Eng P G , and he can collect
his prize from the F E L I X Office on Monday
afternoon.
The Phoenix puzzle was rather trickier. At
some stage in the game, the position shown in
the diagram was reached, Black just having
played B — Q 4 check. White blocked the check
with P — B 4 , whereupon Black played P x P en
passant, double check. White then destroyed
the evidence by playing K x P , and at this stage
the king was knocked from the board.
I received correct entries from Andrew
Britton, Damian Hassan and John Murphy,
and of these A n d r e w B r i t t o n was chosen as
the winner. H e now goes on to the second part
of the competition, which involves finding Sean
Giblin, and persuading him to hand over the
£10 prize. G o o d luck!

Attention all P G s !
N o w I k n o w that you're all very busy lounging around and drinking
coffee all day, but I think that you can spare a little time to contribute to
the P G F E L I X on August 7. After all, it will be my one and only issue
over the summer and I'll need to fill it up with something! So if you've
any interesting ideas for articles, or perhaps want to write a letter or
two, then c o m e into the office and discuss it with me. C o p y
deadline is Wednesday July 29.
C o m e on chaps, let's go!
