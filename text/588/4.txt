Ireland does not work. The only

A strictly private and confidential
letter
Sir —
I would like to be the first to
c o m p l a i n a b o u t y o u r f i n a l
attempt at producing a humor-
ous a n d didascalic F E L I X , by
rendering m y condemnation a n d
disgust at the w a y i n which you
have w a s t e d t h e v a l u a b l e r e -
sources put at your disposal, o n
such ignominious suttra.
T h e r e c o r d o f y o u r m i s -
demeanours speaks for itself. Not
being content with producing
decadent filth and poltrooneristic
material to degrade the morals of
the poor student to the lowest of
levels, you have now embarked
upon a concatenation ol three
F E L I C E S into one. T h e purpose
of this is, no doubt, to allow
yourself more time to indulge i n
pastimes o f a m o r e f r i v o l o u s
nature.
I was appalled to read that you ,
intend to visit- that bastion of
judicial ponderosity and demo-
cracy South America. I will do
my utmost to alert the relevant
authorities in that area to your
intentions and hope that they
will send you to practice your
s u t t e e i s m e l s e w h e r e . R e c e n t
events, however, have shown that
these foreign types seem to have a
liking lor English rogues.
A l l things said, I think you're
very funny. I only hope that
M a r k Smith's perspicaciousness
lives up to that of your own.
Tours sincerely
Paul Donovan
PS: Rumours that I have only
written this letter to prove to you
that I do have grandeur com-
mand over the English language
are totally unfounded and are
without trace of fact. M a y I add
that I wholeheartedly agree with
one ' E ' Jarvis's correspondence
in the last F E L I X . Members of
that irreverent, isopodous institu-
tion, the I F , should really stick to
activities ol which more note has
been taken over the years. If any
members of the aforementioned
group find themselves with spare
lime on their hands, then I urge
them in the strongest possible
terms to come a n d oiler their
services at the F ' E L I X Office. I
will lx- most pleased to find use
lor their limbs on the production
ol" the I C U Handbook.

Hotelier Steve. The Hoys .Ire Hack
House 44 H i t Squad would like
to reply lo ihe letter in F E L I X
587 from J o h n (Zoo2—address
not department) a n d from his
c h u m D a v e W a y w a r d ( B i o -
degradable, too).
1. O u r letter was not aimed at
L u n g e Toseedher, who is. as they
say, a n affable fellow. Shame that
we don't really want h i m , but
S e l k i r k were o f f e r i n g a c a s h
alternative.
2. O u r letter was in criticism
o f A s s h o l e s : A c h i n g s o m e ,
W h o r e b y . M i d g e t a n d H e l e n
Wheels (Acting H a l l Mattress) of
Selkirk H a l l , so balls to them.
3. But now they mention it.
we do have a few bones to pick.
This may take some time, but we
hope you won't mind, as this is
y o u r last F E L I X , a n d w h a t
follows is naughty:
a) Someone got chucked out
of our slum last week. According
to t h e H o u s e C o m m i t t e e
(Tiirdego's rubber stamp), Niche
Moretongue was a prime mover
in the eviction. W e are sure that
this was not because the said
person (whose anonymity can be
maintained by relering to him as
' E n g i n e f a c e ' ) c a l l e d L I Z
L I N D S A Y (of a l l people!) a
fucking old slag.
b) Moretongue, as those who
read his bumf will know, is a
biochemistry postgraduate. This
did not stop h i m from calling in
the drug squad to investigate an
i l l e g a l c a c h e o f flour b o m b s .
Although clearly a sub-warden
with students' interests at heart,
Moretongue is less effective than
B S H plumbing. W e believe that
if t h i s r e c o r d c o n t i n u e s , his
present harmless hackery could
develop into something big. W e
h a v e seen h i m g r o w f r o m a
p a i n - i n - t h e - a s s k n o w - a l l to a
truly great cliche-spoutcr. W e
a r e w i l l i n g to bet t h a t by-
December he will rate Grade 9.9
on the P Arsemore scale (of 1 to
10). ^
e) There is only one comfort-
able room in B S H , but people
keep pissing on the seat (who
wrote this?).
d) O n e g o o d t h i n g a b o u t
next y e a r ' s e x e c — n o s m a r t -
arsed w o m e n ! ( N o b i g - t i t t e d
schoolgirls, either.)
By the way, W I S T are wrong
w h e n t h e y s a y : " W e d o n ' t
h a p p e n to be l i t t l e f u r r y
animals."—we've had a lew of
'em, a n d not only do they have
h a i r v legs, but thev bite like
hell.'
In appreciation ol an excellent
journal.

Y o u r current campaign against
the P r e s i d e n t is d i s g r a c e f u l .
F E L I X is certainly not a paper 1

read.

I wonder if any of your readers
have noted the close resemblance
between C a p t a i n Lindley a n d

Sir
Y o u r current campaign against
the President is disgraceful. I
have frequently been present at
eases in which J o h n has been
involved, and on every occasion I
was firmly of the opinion that he
got to the last bottle.
