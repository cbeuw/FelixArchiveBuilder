A Considered Opinion
The role of the Rector
in College life
It is difficult, if not impossible to disentangle the role of the
R e c t o r as a p o s i t i o n w i t h the person w h o holds that post at a
g i v e n time. It is a c o m m o n p l a c e , but nevertheless true, to say
that effectively the w a y the j o b is d o n e is a n i n t e r a c t i o n of these
two aspects. H o w e v e r , I s h a l l e n d e a v o u r to e x a m i n e i n a little
m o r e d e t a i l h o w this i n t e r a c t i o n works.
T h e post of R e c t o r is that o f h e a d of the C o l l e g e ; a l l aspects of
this C o l l e g e . H e is thus h e a d of the a c a d e m i c staff, h e a d of the
t e c h n i c a l stall, a n d h e a d o f the a d m i n i s t r a t i v e staff. A s such he is
subject to e n o r m o u s pressures f r o m e a c h section of the C o l l e g e .
T h e p r e s s u r e s , w h i c h n o r m a l l y h a v e t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n o f
resources at t h e i r base, c a n take a w i d e v a r i e t y of forms. F o r
e x a m p l e a p p o i n t m e n t s of n e w lecturers f r o m d e p a r t m e n t s have
to be b a l a n c e d by the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n ' s u n q u e n c h a b l e thirst for
n e w a d m i n i s t r a t o r s . I c o u l d go f u r t h e r into the c o m p e t i t i o n for
resources f r o m v a r i o u s c o m m i t t e e s b u t to d o this w o u l d m a k e
this essay m o r e tedious t h a n is necessary. T h i s a l l means, of
course, that the R e c t o r has to be a genius i n o r d e r to keep
e v e r y b o d y h a p p y ; the result is that most people, w h o e v e r
h a p p e n s to be the R e c t o r , are a l w a y s m o d e r a t e l y u n h a p p y . T h e
o t h e r m a i n f u n c t i o n o f the R e c t o r is to represent the C o l l e g e not
o n l y to the u n i v e r s i t y , but also to the w o r l d at large. H e r e a g a i n
he c o m e s u n d e r p r e s s u r e f r o m b e l o w e s p e c i a l l y i n t h e
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n b l o c k i n that he has to defend, i n p u b l i c at least,
the acts w h i c h have been p e r p e t r a t e d by his subordinates, often
w i t h o u t h i s k n o w l e d g e . T h u s w h e t h e r it be a c o v e r - u p
c o n c e r n i n g a student's suicide or the wastage of m o n e y on
useless p u b l i c relations exercises, or the a t t i t u d e t o w a r d s a
g r o u p of students b e l o n g i n g to a m i n o r i t y society, or the
d e p a r t u r e of a prestigious g r o u p of a c a d e m i c s lor a n o t h e r
u n i v e r s i t y , the decisions have been m a d e collectively at a l o w e r
level a n d c a n n o t , w i t h o u t great risk, be altered.
T h i s present R e c t o r c a m e to the post f r o m the S R C a n d has
a t t e m p t e d to a p p l y to this C o l l e g e the policies w h i c h he

attempts to close d o w n or a m a l g a m a t e the d e p a r t m e n t of
a e r o n a u t i c s a n d r u m o u r s (the t r u t h of w h i c h I have been u n a b l e
to verify) to split u p R S M into the o t h e r t w o colleges. H i s ideas
of c e n t r e s of e x c e l l e n c e (eg h e r e , U M I S T , H e r s t m o n c e u x ,
C a m b r i d g e , etc) w h i l e p o s s i b l y valid for t h e short t e r m , i n t h e
l o n g r u n w i l l l e a d to a decline of o r i g i n a l research because s m a l l

have been e x h a u s t e d there w i l l be no o r i g i n a l scientists i n o t h e r
