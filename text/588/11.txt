S t u d e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s o n the v a r i o u s
refectory committees could find it easy to
be taken in by Victor Mooney's false facade
of concern about the standard of catering
here.
In 1970, the unhygenic nature of the
kitchens was widely reported i n The Sun,
when refectory boycotts were organised
a n d a U G M p a s s e d a m o t i o n o f n o
confidence in the refectory chairman at
t h a t t i m e . R e p l y i n g t o a c c u s a t i o n s o f
c o c k r o a c h infestation M r J i m K e a r n s a
College employee told The Sun they were
" h o g w a s h " , b e c a u s e t h e r e w e r e c o c k -
roaches i n all kitchens.
Stupid
During the early 7 0 s there w a s m u c h
c r i t i c i s m of t h e high p r i c e r i s e s i n t h e
refectories as a whole, b u t despite t h e
boycotts and U G M motions, nothing was
dona. In 1975 M r M i k e Williams, a n e x -
F E L I X Editor complained bitterly about the
stupid attitudes taken by V i c t o r M o o n e y
and Peter Teague, then I C U President.
Victor M o o n e y tried to increase refectory
prices by 40% without increasing the quality;
M r Teague wanted refectory boycotts. M r
(Williams called for each side to trust each
other. I suggest that this U n i o n has trusted
Victor M o o n e y long enough, a n d he has
been all t o o willing to betray that trust.
Why?
But why is the refectory service s o bad?
There are many possible replies to this
o f t e n a s k e d q u e s t i o n . V i c t o r M o o n e y ' s
favourite answer is " W e have to provide a
capacity service until C h r i s t m a s a n d for half
that number for the rest of the year." Let's
consider that answer a bit more fully. V i c t o r
M o o n e y lets out a n interesting figure. F o r
one term the refectories are used heavily
and for the other two terms not s o heavily,
but at n o t i m e is t h e f o o d a n y g o o d .
Whether pushed to capacity or ticking over,
Victor M o o n e y just can't seem t o get the
c a t e r i n g r i g h t . S e c o n d l y , V i c t o r M o o n e y
s e e m s a w a r e t h a t t h e n u m b e r s u s i n g
the refectories is dropping all the time. I
suggest that this is because, at first, the
refectories are used in the main by students
in their first y e a r at C o l l e g e . A s t i m e
progresses those students become more
settled in, cooking for themselves, or finding
local eating places.
Excuse
A n o t h e r popular excuse for the catering
here, is that the refectories and bars have to
be self-financing. College decided that it's
U G C g r a n t w o u l d b e s p e n t o n m a i n l y
a c c a d e m i c e x p e n d i t u r e , t h u s m a k i n g it
harder for the U G C to c u t IC's without
h a r m i n g C o l l e g e a c a d e m i c a l l y . S o t h e
refectory service has to pay it's o w n way. If
it makes a loss it can be bailed out by the
Bar profits, but nothing else. O n e year's loss
would have to be recouped by next year's
higher prices.
COCKROACH

roaches.
T h e y found them i n the

zine of students at the
Imperial C o l l e g e of

It was the last straw when
three students found

au-vent.
" " H o g - w a s h '
Students are now planning
to boycott the dining
hall.
Student William Honey-
borne said yesterday:
" Sprays no longer have
any effect because there
are so many cock-
roaches.
" We canont give the date
of the boycott because
we do not want it a n t i -
cipated i n the kitchens."
College staff member J i m
Kearns, said: " These
complaints are a lot of
hogwash. In all kitchens
there are a certain n u m -
ber of cockroaches."
An extract from The Sun, January 19
1970. If Mr Mooney were a commercial
caterer he would probably hit the headlines
more often.
But there are other reasons w h i c h might
h e l p t o e x p l a i n t h e s i t u a t i o n . If t h e
u n c o o k e d food is of a poor quality, then n o
m a t t e r h o w w e l l c o o k e d , i n a f l y l e s s ,
c o c k r o a c h l e s s k i t c h e n , b y e x p e r i e n c e d
staff, it still will c o m e out as rubbish, eg a
sausage made of sawdust will never be "fit
for a K i n g " (or Prince Phillip).
But even "sawdust sausages" could not
be expected to survive the battering given
to them in M o o n e y ' s kitchens.
I said it was important to recall that V i c t o r
M o o n e y has been at this College for a long
time. During that period he has built u p
good relationships with many influential
people in College and the U n i o n . H e has
been made a member of at least two C C U
drinking clubs—no doubt for his services to
annual dinners, and by assisting the rising
stars in College has made life a bit easier for
himself. W h e n dignatories have visited the
College, eg for Meet I C o r Royal Visits,
Victor M o o n e y has ensured that the food is
of the highest quality—thus giving a false
impression of the catering here. Whilst the
functional catering is often to be highly
r e c o m m e n d e d , it must be r e m e m b e r e d that
the Refectories are here to provide a service
to students and staff, not to entertain rich
outsiders.
Immunity
O v e r the years then, I suggest that V i c t o r
M o o n e y has built u p a n almost complete
i m m u n i t y f r o m c r i t i c i s m a i m e d at h i m
personally, o r at the b r a n c h of the domestic
service h e is personally responsible for
maintaining. This does not help, because
the authorities i n the U n i o n often want
people in College to be criticised, i n the
hope of getting some action out of them. If
serious criticism is not accepted, then only
satire and sarcasm are left.
Criticism
The criticisms of V i c t o r M o o n e y and the
catering have tended to overshadow what is
being criticised. T h e catering has become a
long-standing joke, and students n o doubt
ask themselves is it really w o r t h bothering
to complain, is it really w o r t h causing a fuss?
I suggest that because of the nature of the
composition of the College few students are
prepared to struggle against the refectory
system. Within the first few weeks they have
become ground d o w n by the food and are
more interested i n their degree than i n
taking part in any process of change. T h e
College authorities must not think for o n e
minute that the lack of action by the U n i o n
and the often h u m o r o u s attitude addopted
by F E L I X toward M r M o o n e y means that
the catering here is grudgingly accepted by
"the silent majority" of students, because it
is most emphatically not.
Peroration
In the 1950s V i c t o r M o o n e y was regarded
as a competent refectory manager. Since
that time, the size of the College has grown,
t h e d e m a n d s m a d e o n t h e r e f e c t o r y
m a n a g e r h a v e i n c r e a s e d , a n d V i c t o r
Mooney's reputation has taken a tumble. I
suggest that this is because the job has gone
o u t s i d e h i s a b i l i t y . D e s p i t e t h e m o s t
ferocious criticism of him in F E L I X and at
U n i o n meetings over the last twenty years,
there has been n o general improvement in
the taste or reduction i n the extortionate
prices of refectory food.
W h y should I C be s o sadly striken with
such unappetising food? W h y should the
food remain s o bad for s o long, even though
the k i t c h e n s h a v e t h e m o s t u p - t o - d a t e
e q u i p m e n t ? I b e l i e v e t h a t t h e r e is o n e
connection between these and all the points
ever made about the food here in the last 28
years. That connection is none other than
Victor M o o n e y .
The plain truth is that V i c t o r M o o n e y
simply isn't u p to his job of organising the
catering here. It's not an easy job, there are
maybe only a small number of people w h o
could d o it. Unfortunately, V i c t o r M o o n e y
isn't o n e of that small number.
Whatever good he has done, whatever
wrong he has suffered, this writer asks y o u
to accept that V i c t o r M o o n e y should never
have been given control of the catering
here, that no one regrets it more than those
responsible for his appointment and V i c t o r
M o o n e y himself, there can be n o improve-
ment in the catering whilst V i c t o r M o o n e y is
still here, so the sooner he goes the better.
