Did so little really happen?
ICU's year started with a bang (or a smash)
when thieves broke into the Union Office and
stole about £5,000 worth of trophies from the
cabinet. A t that time the Union had been
pressing for better locks and an alarm for the
cabinet, but due to slow moving administration
in the Estates Dept, headed by M r D Clark, no
action had been taken; despite letters from last
year's Deputy President, Malcolm Brain. Even
now, the cabinet is not locked, but an alarm
has been fixed up. It seems unlikely that
Estates will get round to doing anything about
this for some time.
A n o t h e r area where R a e Snee, D e p u t y
President, has crossed swords with Estates
has been over Southside security. After
Estates had assured her that the work of fitting
new locking doors in the lower levels would be
completed by early May, it later transpired that
estimates were still being considered after the
supposed date for completion.
Union Meetings
One area of Union politics which has been ot
concern this year, as indeed in most previous
years, has been the low attendance at U G M s .
Out of nine meetings held, five were closed
due to inquoracy. The Freshers' U G M was
stopped by Steve Goulder, as was a meeting in
the spring term, giving him a reputation as M r
Quorum Caller.
At the second meeting, motions on overseas
students a n d G r e e k students fees were
passed, as was a motion on lecturer training.
T h i s m e e t i n g also p a s s e d a m o t i o n o n
limiting to once a term motions o n the same
matter.
The third meeting in the first term was well
attended and motions were passed affiliating
C N D and opposing South African sponsored
s t u d e n t s o n n u c l e a r fuels c o u r s e s . T h e
meeting also passed a motion criticising Steve
Marshall's recent satirical attacks o n Dare
Afolabi and others.
S o o n a f t e r C h r i s t m a s c a m e a n o t h e r
meeting—one of the worst attended, as many
students didn't know about it, or were doing
exams. However the meeting passed a motion
on bicycles before closing due to lack of
business. The next meeting was something of
a mix-up. The date had to be brought forward
hurriedly, after the F E L I X Editor pointed out
to the Exec that bye-law changes given their
first reading before Christmas would be lost if
the next meeting was not held within forty
College days. So the date was changed and the
turnout disappointingly low. This did not stop
the meeting being very heated, as the low
attendance seemed to be blamed on the Exec,
some of whom reacted angrily.
The S a b b a t i c a l H u s t i n g s M e e t i n g came
next. This was very well attended and a motion
of N o Confidence in the F E L I X Editor was
proposed which proved very interesting. The
results meeting was closed due to inquoracy.
In the third t e r m , both meetings were
stopped but a motion did get passed on the
Union's distribution of finances. Thus over the
year eight motions were passed.
The motion on C N D affiliation caused a stir,
as there were legal problems over spending
Union money on matters outside the Union
constitutional powers. The in-phrase at that
time for most of the Union was ultra vires,
whilst for F E L I X it was ejustem generis. This
legal principle showed the limited way in which
the byelaws would be interpreted if tested in
court, and after many telephone calls and
letters from the Union to its solicitors, the
decision was finally taken not to affiliate to
C N D .
Another motion which was part of a larger
campaign by some students in the Union was
that involving S o u t h A f r i c a n students o n
nuclear courses here. The College policy is to
allow this, but some students have picketed
G o v e r n i n g B o d y , organised debates a n d
lobbied the Rector to change this, but without
any apparent success.
One thing to come out of this year's Union
meetings were some changes in the Union
Byelaws. The first, to disband I C W A had been
going through "first readings" for a few years,
but not until this term was I C W A finally
a b o l i s h e d (subject t o G o v e r n i n g B o d y ' s
approval).
In October. John Passmore, I C U President,
organised a freshers' concert with N o Dice.
Due to lack of action on his behalf, the concert
lost £500. and John Passmore admitted total
responsibility for the flop, and said "I don't
know what I'll do . . . I think I'll resign."

Edinburgh Award Scheme came in November,
a n d this r e s u l t e d i n M r M o o n e y b e i n g
described as a superb caterer in College, and
Captain Lindley admitting he didn't know
exactly what was going on. The visitors the
next week were iess welcome. They abused
the U n i o n O f f i c e staff a n d stole J o h n
P a s s m o r e for a few hours. F r e d Sanger,
double Nobel prizewinner, came in December,
and Shirley Williams came in January. She
returned later in the year to inaugurate the
S D P at the College.
In February the Navy came to tell us what
they do, and D r Magnus Pyke came to wave
his arms about. This month also saw D r Garry
Hunt, Giles Shaw M P and Raymond Baxter. In
March we had Mark Carlisle M P , Patrick
Moore, and Ian McGregor. So this year IC has
had its fair share of important visitors, but the
fatal attraction of the College seems elusive to
this writer.
Barney McCabe, ICU Deputy President-elect,
stresses a point during the election run-up.
Elections this year were fairly uncontroversial. but
did produce some unexpected candidates.
Visitors
Visitors to College this year have been most
interesting. Sir Keith Joseph pointed the way
in October; Prince Phillip and the Duke of
Headbangers? No, a display of Martial Arts in the
JCR during International Week.
