V i c t o r M o o n e y : T h e T r u t h .
D e s p i s e d a n d r e j e c t e d , a figure o f fun
throughout the College, many students feel
V i c t o r M o o n e y to be personally responsible
for the poor Refectory service. T h e y see
him as the object for the hate and derision
that swells u p in them when eating the
p o o r l y s e r v e d " c h e e p s " a n d u n n a t u r a l
tasting meat courses. Powerless to struggle
against the Refectories, with a U n i o n which
so often turns a blind-eye to the iniquity and
unjustness of V i c t o r M o o n e y with his own
yacht, how can such a student register his
d i s a p p o i n t m e n t w i t h t h e m e n a c e o f
M o o n e y ' s monsterous monopoly?
O n e very important thing to be remem-
b e r e d w h e n c o n s i d e r i n g the R e f e c t o r y
services, is that V i c t o r M o o n e y has been at
this College for twenty-eight years.
O n e of the earliest references to V i c t o r
M o o n e y in F E L I X was in 1955 when he took
over all t h e College catering when Miss
" Q u e e n i e " B o w n i n g left, F E L I X wished him
"the best of luck o n his new, a n d difficult
venture".
Later o n that year in a Suggestions B o o k
someone wrote " G o o d old M o o n e y ! K e e p
u p the g o o d w o r k ! K e e p off the g !
opposite w h i c h the "dietician-in-chief" wrote
" n o t e d " . T a k i n g i n t o a c c o u n t t h e
proposition that students were in those days
a bit more civil, "keep up the good w o r k " is
still a congratulatory remark. H o w many
people today, twenty-six years later, would
feel able t o similarly praise him?
T r i p p i n g t h r o u g h the y e a r s , t o 1956,
V i c t o r M o o n e y again has praise heaped
upon h i m , this time for his "magnificent and
d e t e r m i n e d e f f o r t " i n o p e n i n g a n e w
refectory in o n e day, despite set backs
which would have "demoralised a lesser
Praise
T h e s e a r e s o m e e x a m p l e s o f t h e
laudatory statements made about Victor
M o o n e y , and at n o stage is there even the
merest hint of U n i o n criticism of him. But a
few things need to be remembered about
events at that time. Firstly, M r M o o n e y was
a vivacious thirty-three year-old full of new
ideas and eager to please, there were less
staff which created a better atmosphere,
and those staff showed some sign of pride in
their work. A l s o , at that time, the College
was m u c h smaller and easier to run.
Decrepitude
M e a n w h i l e i n 1957, M r M o o n e y was
experimenting to cut the size of "enormous
s u p p e r q u e u e s " . P e r h a p s t h o s e e x p e r i -
ments w o r k e d t o o well. A t this time also
IC's catering began in this writer's view it's
long process of collapsing into an inexor-
able pit of decrepitude. F o r instance the
Suggestions B o o k contains remarks about
peas; comparing them to lead shot, green
bullets and indigestible ball-bearings. T h e
substance of the complaints has remained
fairly similar although since then the style
has changed; eg " T h e white of an egg was
rubbery, the yoke more so. The peas were
hard. T h e chips were leathery and the whole
dish was quite cold." A n d , " F o r sometime I
have been confused regarding engineering
terms, e g ductility, rigidity, tensile strength,
h a r d n e s s a n d b r i t t l e n e s s . Y o u r p a s t r y
d e m o n s t r a t e s t h e l o t . " ( A possible first
reference to T H E baked minced beef roll?)
Complaints
In 1961, M r M o o n e y was p e r s o n a l l y
attacked in F E L I X for ignoring sugestions
a n d c o m p l a i n t s , a n d f o r his t o t a l indif-
ference. C o u l d this possibly be the same M r
M o o n e y w h o only s i x years earlier w a s
hailed as a hero by the Union? Y e s .
A t the start of the A u t u m n term, 1961
F E L I X reported the long queues in the
R e f e c t o r y . A t t h i s t i m e , t h e d e m a n d
outstripped the supply, and the staff had to
try very hard to get everyone served.
E v e n i n 1961 t h o u g h , c o m p l a i n t s of
extraneous materials finding their way into
helpings of food were made, eg a "bundle of
wire, t w o thirds of which I unfortunately
s w a l l o w e d while e a t i n g y o u r o t h e r w i s e
excellent apple pie". M r M o o n e y gave his
n o w f a m i l i a r r e p l y of a s k i n g the c o m -
plainants to take the meal back to the
counter at the time.
Bring it back
This simple request—bring it back at the
time—is o n e of the best defensive ploys
used by V i c t o r M o o n e y to keep criticism of
the refectories to a m i n i m u m ; why else use it
for twenty years? W h a t student is going to
r i s k t h e d i s g r u n t l e m e n t o f o t h e r s b y
r e t u r n i n g t o t h e c o u n t e r t o m a k e a
complaint about the food to the staff who
often, through n o fault of their own, find
d i f f i c u l t y u n d e r s t a n d i n g E n g l i s h , t h u s
holding u p the queue and upsetting a n
already touchy staff member. A cry of "the
peas are cold today" might be better, and a
warning like "don't have the salad, there's
glass in it" would surely help others to avoid
the o d d dish that even M r Victor M o o n e y
admits "we fall d o w n o n " .
Victor M o o n e y hit the headlines again in
1973. H e was condemned for his attitude to
U n i o n meetings, having "developed a fine
art in fending off questions like some dispas-
ionate observer. Listening to his U n i o n
meeting offerings it seemed hardly credible
that he has any responsibilities towards IC
catering at all". A l s o " M r M o o n e y ' s general
aims seemed to be to pass on the blame and
responsibility to others. Price 'increases' are
the fault of c a s h i e r s o v e r c h a r g i n g , the
continuance of the habit is the fault of
students not complaining, and the fault for
the bad quality of the food lies with the
refectories having t o o many customers."
