Women in Hall:
the Final Word
The Rector has recently received a petition from a number of students
a r g u i n g that t h e proposals agreed b y t h e Students R e s i d e n c e
Committee concerning the redistribution of women's places in Halls
are contrary to the best interests of women at Imperial College.
After consultation with the S R C the Rector is satisfied that the w e l l -
being of women students has been carefully considered. The changes
proposed for next session simply represent the next step in the policy
which has been evolved over many years to increase the number of
mixed residences in the College and to increase the number of places
for women as their overall numbers increase, this year including the
provision of an additional sixteen places in H a l l for women students.
The achievement of a satisfactory balance is difficult and will remain
so until there is a substantial increase in the number of women students
overall, but it has always been seen that there must be a reasonable
percentage representation of women i n any mixed hall. N e w mixed
halls have been introduced, in the past and as proposed now, by first
increasing the number of places allocated to women in existing mixed
halls and then transferring a block of these places to an all-male hall.
The proposals now made will result in the following changes:
B E I T H A L L : Decrease in women's places from 46 to 28 and a n
equivalent increase of 18 places for men.
S E L K I R K H A L L : Decrease in women's places from 30 to 24 and an
equivalent increase of 6 places for men.
T I Z A R D H A L L : T o become mixed with 24 women's places and 96
men's places.
W E E K S H A L L : T o become mixed with 16 women's places and 50
men's places.
There will be no other changes.
H a v i n g made the decision that T i z a r d and Weeks Halls should be
mixed it would be inappropriate, as the petitioners must realise, to
provide only two or three women's places in each and so quotas i n
multiples of eight have been agreed. Over the next few years the
number of women's places will continue to be increased until it is
possible for further residences to become mixed. Beit H a l l , from which
most protests about the proposed redistribution have come, will still
have 28 women's places to 87 men's places.
Seats
Pinched
O V E R T H E P A S T four months,
sixty-live chairs have disappeared
from the U n i o n Lower Refectory.
It is suspected that some have
b e e n d i s t r i b u t e d a r o u n d t h e
U n i o n , but t h e m a i n line o f
thinking seems to be that Beit
r e s i d e n t s h a v e n i c k e d t h e m .
However, when F E L I X asked a
Beit resident about this allegation,
he told us that there wasn't
enough room in a Beit room lor
extra furniture, and that there
were t w o chairs a l r e a d y . M r
Reeves (Chief Security Officer)
would appreciate it if the chairs
could be returned as soon as
possible, otherwise a search will
have to be carried out.

says Rector
Sir Henry T i z a r d , Rector of I C
1929-1944, led a group which
submitted plans for an attack o n
Russian cities by Britain using
atomic bombs and germ warfare
weapons to the joint chiefs of staff
technical warfare committee i n
1946. These have recently been
found in documents at the Public
Records Office.
Reports included a list of all
Russian cities with a population
of m o r e t h a n 100,000 w i t h i n
bombing range of British bases.
A total of fifty-eight target
cities making u p 17.5% of the
Soviet Union's urban population
lay within range of the bases.
The committee concluded that
the most profitable objects of
attack by the new weapons will
normally be concentrations of
population, centres of distribu-
tion a n d communication. (F'or
