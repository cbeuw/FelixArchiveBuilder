leg above the knee and right sleeve, a rope
noose is hung r o u n d his neck a n d his left
breast bared. A l l metal objects are removed
from his person (see below).
D u r i n g t h e i n i t i a t i o n he is t o l d t h e
"secrets" of M a s o n r y (grips, passwords,
etc) a n d then he pledges an oath on the
Bible which if he breaks may result in him
having his throat cut, his tongue torn out,
his left breast laid open, his body severed in
two a n d bowels burned to ashes, his head
cut off, his right hand cut off a n d slung over
his left shoulder to wither and die.
It may all sound very silly but it seems to
be an adult game worth playing for the
benefits it reaps if the number of Free-
masons high in the College administration
structure is anything to go by.
It is of great interest that the M a s o n i c
Dinners, which up until early this year were
held at the British Masonic Headquarters in
G r e a t Q u e e n Street, have now been shifted
to the refectory in the Sherfield Building.
This means that Freemasons from all over
the country c o m e to Imperial College to eat!
I a m informed by a M a s o n who travels
four hundred miles to attend these dinners
that "the food is simply excellent and the
price is so cheap". W e asked M r M o o n e y
directly if he was a M a s o n and he denied any
suggestion that he was. However, if he were
a M a s o n he would be under oath not to
divulge the fact to us. It is a well-known fact
that M r M o o n e y often b o o k s dinners in the
Sherfield Building under the name of " T h e
White Lodge Golf C l u b " . M r M o o n e y does
not play golf (see F E L I X interview N o .
569) and the aforementioned golf club is in
f a c t a M a s o n i c L o d g e . If M r M o o n e y
is not already a F r e e m a s o n , then perhaps he
would like to be. F o r the G r a n d Lodge to
choose Imperial College in which to dine I
can only think that they are getting a very
good deal indeed.
M a n y top officials in the Sherfield Building
are Freemasons. T h e y mostly belong to the
H a m m e r s m i t h A r t s and Sciences Lodge.
(This is curious since dinners are b o o k e d
under the G o l f C l u b — s u r e l y someone in
College belongs to fhis Lodge?)
T h e "College L o d g e " is quite active. It
holds regular meetings in its T e m p l e — t h e
Q u i e t R o o m i n t h e b a s e m e n t of t h e
Sherfield Building. It is quite possible to
c a t c h g l i m p s e s of w e l l - k n o w n C o l l e g e
figures in M a s o n i c regalia if you wander out
of the Sherfield ground level toilets back
entrance down to the Quiet R o o m . If you're
very lucky, you might even catch a glimpse
of an initiate ( 4 0 0 A S A film, avoid flash a n d
s e n d i m m e d i a t e l y to F E L I X f o r h e f t y
payment!)
Not so long ago, the Islamic Society were
prevented from utilising the Quiet R o o m as
a p r a y e r r o o m ! R u m o u r s a b o u n d of a
Masonic influence but I'm quite convinced
they have no factual basis.
Incidentally, the two cleaners' cupboards
near the Quiet R o o m (which the cleaners
don't have a key to) are used for storing
Masonic regalia. A n d next to the Quiet
R o o m is a snooker r o o m which is undoubt-
edly put to good use o n a Lodge night.
S o what does it all mean. What's w r o n g
with the College dignitories dressing up a n d
playing in an undignified manner, having a
few beers and a few smokes in the snooker
room. Absolutely nothing! But is that all
there is to it? Let me conclude by asking a
couple of questions:
H o w can Imperial College catering be
recognised by representatives of over half a
million British Freemasons as the best deal
in terms of quality and price of food, even
better than the catering it can provide itself
at the G r e a t Q u e e n Street headquarters?
W h i c h people in College administration
a r e h o l d i n g p o s t s p u r e l y a n d s i m p l y
because they are Freemasons and not on
any proven ability?
