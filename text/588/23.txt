I feel that this Editorial is going to be somewhat
of an anti-climax to those of you who expect
me to slag off all those lazy, inefficient ponces
who have the audacity to call themselves
Union Officers or College administrators. I
have nothing specific to say about anything at
the moment and everything you are about lo
read is purely a collection of jottings that come
to mind as I sit here thinking about ways of
filling the entire back page.
I will resist the t e m p t a t i o n to recount
personalia as I understand the F E L J X staff are
k n o c k i n g s o m e t h i n g t o g e t h e r a b o u t me
overleaf "(dread the thought!). Some people
this year have accused me (or even praised
me, dare I say it) for being far too outspoken
and downright rude.
I must admit that I never i n t e n d e d to
b e c o m e n o t o r i o u s as F E L I X E d i t o r or to
impose my character on F E L I X to the extent
that I have. I originally aimed to take a laid-
back approach, keeping out of the limelight (as
it were), adding balance here and there with an
editorial comment on a few pertinent issues.
Then Dare Afolabi came along! It all started
when M a r k Smith (Editor-elect) chopped the
last paragraph off his Afro-Carib article to
make it fit—it just happended to be about
apartheid. H e assumed I (it wasn't even me)
had "censored" him. (Don't they always?).
M r Afolabi sent me a stormer of a letter
accusing me of infringing the I C U Constitution,
c e n s o r s h i p , a n d worst of a l l , r e s t r i c t i n g
freedom of expression. Nothing annoys me
more than being accused of acting against one
of my own strong beliefs—I've always been
strongly in favour of freedom of expression—
no matter how right-wing or left-wing your
views may be. Nevertheless, I kept my cool.
Then Afolabi sent another letter and another,
a n d a n o t h e r I r e a c t e d . M y r e a c t i o n
p r o v o k e d a c h a i n r e a c t i o n . F e e d b a c k is<
pleasing, positive or negative; I started to take
more personal interest in F E L I X and have
used it to provoke interest ever since.
However, I would add that I hold M r Afolabi
and others like him in considerable contempt, I
am not racist (I A M sexist), and I believe the
apartheid system is very, very wrong.
While the members of the Anti-Apartheid
G r o u p d e s e r v e e v e r y p r a i s e f o r t h e i r
determined efforts, they must realise they will
achieve nothing concrete. The only situation
where they could have gained some headway
c o n c e r n e d the a d m i s s i o n of white S o u t h
A f r i c a n students to the College's nuclear
technoloffi/ course. Without wishing to be
labelled as a evil supporter of the Fascist
Regime, I cannot agree with this move as, like
the Rector, I believe academic freedom is a far
more important consideration.
Were the left-wingers to actively campaign
a b o u t t h i n g s c l o s e r to h o m e s u c h as
refectories, Hall rents and the College's
determined efforts to waste thousands of
pounds on utter flops such as Meet IC then
this place might be just a little more lively.
I have attempted to keep F E L I X concen-
trated firmly on internal matters this year and I
believe this is the right policy—perhaps this
the reason why U G M s failed so abysmally this
year. I have criticised the Union, or more
correctly, its officers without second thought
for the continuance of a " g o o d w o r k i n g
working relationship" with them. I detest most
of them anyway. John Passmore, who still
insists on greeting me pleasantly, will be
forgotten next year, tucked away on his Phd in
the Mines department, which lowered their
u s u a l h i g h s t a n d a r d s in a c c e p t i n g h i m .
However, personalities in College administra-
tion (Viee-tr Mooney and Captain Lindley
come eagerly to mind) will still be here next
year. Victor Mooney is hardened to criticism
after twenty years of it, so I attempted a new
approach this year. The "New Years Honours
Shock" seemed to cause quite a jolly stir (you
s h o u l d have seen the original article we
decided N O T to print). I was surprised by the
o u t c r y , I m u s t a d m i t . I h a d no official
correspondence from Victor Mooney himself
but the Rector was disgusted. John Passmore
agreed with the Rector that it was disgusting (I
saw him laughing!). I was told by a senior
Sherfield man sympathetic to the cause, that
"it is not unusual for a senior refectory
manager who often caters for Royalty with
thirty-years experience to receive a C B E or
something similar". It was suggested that I had
hit Victor Mooney below the belt. M y repost
was the same as always, Victor Mooney has
been hitting us all below the belt for many
years. Even when the College are eventually
find of him, the refectories will still need a good
five years sorting out. It's simply pathetic.
Captain Lindley is altogether another kettle
of fish. Prior to this year, the Captain had
come off lightly, if mentioned at all, in the
pages of F E L I X . I believe that my predecessors
were actually put off by his pretentious use of
rank. I find it difficult to have any faith in the
naval defence of this country after meeting and
talking to Captain Lindley. The amazing thing
is that the top officers in the Sherfield Building
talk about the Captain in a far more cutting
manner than I would ever consider publishing.
Not only has he been a figure of fun in the
Union, but also in Sherfield. What a pity Topic
doesn't have a gossip column! This man has
the responsibilities which most directly affect
students. A s Domestic Secretary, he is Victor
M o o n e y ' s b o s s , in o v e r a l l c h a r g e of a l l
refectories and bars; he has direct responsi-
bility for Halls of Residence and Houses; he is
in charge of the booking of rooms and all
cleaners; and, to top it all, he looks after the
security of the entire College. T o o m u c h
responsibility for one man, without having to
contend with F E L I X as well (not to mention
Meet IC) you might well say. Obviously.
Some of the thing I never got round to. I
would have liked to have had more feature
articles but there just weren't enough staff to
write them. I had envisaged an article on
College-owned flats; you know, the ones they
don't tell students about, leave vacant for ages,
then move in some College person for a few
weeks, on a "need basis". H o w many people
realise there are two fully-furnished flats in the
Union Building? I'm not sure if many in the
Union realise it. These two flats are marked
only by unassuming front doors on the west
staircase of the Union Building and are omitted
from the diagram in the Handbook. They are
both known as "Refectory Flats", intended for
people in the refectory service—often those
who work in the Union Refectory, so that they
haven't far to walk in the mornings presum-
ably. The flats are let at very low rates. The
disgraceful thing is that one of these flats has
been left e m p t y for two years! O K , flat-
hunters, now you know, I suggest you look up
your squatters' rights before the College find a
"needy person". They've been iooking for two
years, so they're bound to find one real soon.
Victor Mooney has a very nice flat near
Southside. Recently redecorated I understand.
£1,000. A number of College employees live in
N o 8 P r i n c e s G a r d e n s a n d o t h e r s are
sprinkled around Princes and Evelyn Gardens.
However, a lot seem quite legitimate and will
warrant no further attention.
68 E v e l y n G a r d e n s . I n t e r e s t i n g little
number. This house contains six flats originally
intended for married IC students. To the best of
available knowledge, only two are occupied by
students. One is home sweet home for Stan,
the drunk who used to swear at people in the
Southside Bar before he was moved to the
Holland Club. H e was obviously thought to be
in n e e d by M i s s W h i t e , w h o was t h e n
Secretary to the "Accornmodatin Selection
Committee" and a friend. The way of the
world, I suppose!
Again in 68, one flat had been empty for
fifteen months. Miss White has denied that the
flat was empty for this period and the College
even d e n i e d that the flat was empty I N
W R I T I N G to Camden Council Housing A i d
Centre after a married student couple had
applied for it, knowing it to be empty. A t least
twelve people applied for the flat in 1979 by the
time it was leased to M r Chappells, a senior
engineer in the Estates department, just three
weeks after Camden Council had requested
information from College. It was leased on the
grounds that "no one else had applied for it".
Rent £32.20 per week. Not bad for a flat
suitable for a married person with children.
Y e s s i r , C o l l e g e - o w n e d flats sure is an
interesting topic. Is there anything else that
springs to mind while I've got a pen in my
hand? Well, what about the latest episode of
petty backslapping amongst Union hacks—ie
the practice of awarding engraved pewter pots
at the last Union Council of the year. Rae
Snee wants to put a motion to Council to stop
the awarding of pots as it's costing a lot of
money. What another noble thought! Mind
you, she's clever enough to realise that while
John Passmore is stupid enough to give her a
U G A , even Council wouldn't let her have a
pot. L i z Lindsay is up in arms! She wants an
I C U pot to "complete her set" and she isn't
about to let Rae Snee do her down. Personally,
I thought a pot was for pissing in!
Finally, I would like to thank Mark Smith,
Patrick Coll, T i m Hillyer, Colin Palmer, Phil
Webb, Andy Dixon, Martin Taylor, Shanne
Woodhouse, Dave Britton, Dave Jago, Steve
Goulder, "Eric" Jarvis, Pallab Ghosh, Paul

G i b l i n for h e l p i n g o n F E L I X t h i s y e a r .
Sincerest apologies to anyone I've missed out.
I'd like to extend a special thanks to M r s
Adams and M r s Vary, the Botany/Zoology tea
ladies who have made 3:00pm a great time to
be* arouind. Also M a z Fellows, the photo-
typesetter-operator a n d Ian M o r s e , litho-
operator, who I have put up with all year
(variation on an old theme).
A s for the rest of Imperial College, I hate you
all. Adios.
