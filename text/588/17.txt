FREEMASONRY
A Helping Hand in College?
THE FIRST DEGREE GRIP: recognised by all masons as the universal
handshake. Notice that the thumb presses into the first joint of the forefinger
where it meets the hand.
Following the recent controversy over the
P2 Lodge in Italy and the almost inevitable
corruption that follows after all the higher
echelons of a society dedicate themselves
to perpetuating their o w n interests, the
E d i t o r d e c i d e d t o i n v e s t i g a t e t h e part
F r e e m a s o n r y p l a y s i n t h e r u n n i n g of
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e . T h e s u b j e c t o f
Freemasonry is, b y its very nature, poorly
p u b l i c i s e d a n d t h e r e c a n b e f e w n o n -
Freemasons who have any knowledge of the
Craft itself, let alone its influence in the
College. This article attempts to shed a
little light o n both, but cannot hope to be
definitive. Belonging to a masonic lodge
should not be thought of as a crime. The
author feels that while the true concept of
masonry itself is not necessarily a point of
contention, it does indeed provide a means
of corruption.
T h e p o p u l a r i s e d v i e w a m o n g s t n o n -
Freemasons is that M a s o n s are a group of
people w h o wander round from top job to
top job b y simply knowing the right secret
handshake, and prance around half-naked
when being initiated into the Lodge. T h e
popularised view amongst M a s o n s is that
non-Masons have n o idea what the secret
handshake is ('cos it's secret) a n d couldn't
p o s s i b l y k n o w w h a t h a p p e n s d u r i n g a
M a s o n ' s i n i t i a t i o n . W e l l , t h e f o r m e r
description is not far from the truth and the
latter statement is way off the mark as
M a s o n i c literature may be obtained with
(relative) e a s e . ( S e e o t h e r s o u r c e s of
references list at end.)
T h e Masonic Craft is based o n K i n g
Solomon's Temple; all references i n the
initiation ceremonies and curious passwords
are derived from this source and may be
read about quite freely in W a l t o n Hannah's
excellent book Darkness Visible.
W a l t o n H a n n a h (a non-Freemason), who
is n o w i n C a n a d a , researched the book
w h i l e h e w a s a C h u r c h m a n b a s e d i n
Queensgate, i n conjunction with a senior
member of t h e academic staff at I C . M r
H a n n a h obtained information by posing as a
M a s o n utilising Masonic robes sold off by a
M a s o n ' s widow. A n enlightening book, well
worth a read if you can find a copy.
O n first impressions, Freemasons might
be regarded as kids who have not yet grown
up. Freemasonry cannot be dismissed s o
easily when one realises there are over half a
million Freemasons in G r e a t Britain alone.
M o s t o c c u p y senior jobs and are pledged to
help one another out when " i n need", even
though the individuals may be complete
strangers to each other. They recognise one
another firstly b y a Universal H a n d s h a k e ,
more correctly called the "First Degree" or
" E n t e r e d A p p r e n t i c e " h a n d s h a k e ( s e e
b e l o w ) a n d t h e n l a t e r b y d r o p p i n g
formations of words from the Masoni c ritual
into everyday conversation, eg reference to
a knife a n d fork in a restaurant as " w o r k i n g
tools". There a r e even M a s o n i c gestures
which to the unsuspecting non-Freemason
would go totally unnoticed, eg drawing one's
glass across the throat before drinking,
which is an extension of a "cut my throat
and hope to die" penal sign of the First
Degree.
H o w a M a s o n " u s e s " h i s m a s s i v e
collection of " c o n n e c t i o n s " depends, of
course, o n the individual's personality. O n
one hand, Freemasonry is a large, very
active social club that collects money for
charity and provides funds for a hospital
(the Royal Masonic Hospitalâ€”there is one
near Hamlet Gardens), but o n the other it
can be seen as an unfair route to positions
w h i c h w o u l d b e h a r d e r t o r e a c h b y
conventional means and, at a n extreme,
downright corruption as in Italy.
I h a v e m e n t i o n e d t h e " D e g r e e " o f
Freemasonry. There are three main levels of
the C r a f t , " F i r s t D e g r e e " o r " E n t e r e d
Apprentice"; " S e c o n d Degree" or "Fellow-
Craft"; " T h i r d Degree" or " M a s t e r M a s o n " .
After this comes the " R o y a l A r c h " , but I will
not d w e l l o n this h e r e . M a s o n s of all
degrees may belong to the same Lodge,
which usually opens its ceremonies in the
First Degree (at which S e c o n d and Third
Degree M a s o n s are present). The Lodge or
Masonic Temple should ideally be in the
form of a double cube facing East and West.
T h e head of the Lodge, the Worshipful
Master, sits in the East. H i s emblem, the
Stone M a s o n s tee-square is usually carved
or painted o n his pedestal. The Masonic
symbols of a square and compasses usually
rest on a cushion with the V o l u m e of Sacred
L a w . T h e W o r s h i p f u l M a s t e r ' s d i r e c t
s u b o r d i n a t e , t h e S e n i o r W a r d e n s i t s
opposite in the West. The Junior W a r d e n
(with plumb line emblem) sits in the S o u t h .
T h e n we have Past Masters, the Senior
and Junior Deacons and the Inner G u a r d .
These are the "officers" of a Masonic Lodge
and control all of its functions and are
i n s t r u m e n t a l i n t h e i n i t i a t i o n of a n e w
Candidate to the Lodge. Outside the temple
stands the Tyler, the outer guard to the
meeting w h o helps candidates dress for
initiation and "fends off" intruders.
T h e ordinary M a s o n s wear aprons to
indicate their Degree. T h e First is of plain
white lambskin, the S e c o n d is the same but
with two blue rosettes in the lower corners
and the T h i r d is bordered with blue, has
metal tassles and a third rosette in the point
of the flap. Office bearers wear jewels and
emblems of their office from collars of blue
silk.
A different floor c o v e r i n g (a " t r a c i n g
board") is laid down dependent o n which
Degree the Lodge is conducting its business
in. W h e n the Lodge transfers from First
Degree to S e c o n d Degree it does so to the
exclusion of the First Degree M a s o n s , who
are asked to leave. There are recognisable
handshakes of the various degrees, a n d
these are used during the rituals; the First

there are signs and gestures ranging from
