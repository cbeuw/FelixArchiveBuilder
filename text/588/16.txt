And here's my third end-of-term puzzle page, and
welcome to it! As before, the puzzles are of two
types. Unmarked puzzles are for amusement
only. They're on the easy side, but that doesn't
mean they're trivial, and if the answer to the
poker puzzle opposite seems obvious, then think
again!
The sworded puzzles each carry a £2 prize
which will be awarded to the first correct solution
opened at 1:00pm on the first day of next term. In
addition, for the person who answers the most
prize puzzles correctly, there is a cash bonus of
£2, plus a £10 voucher redeemable at Mend-a
Bike. If there is a tie for this prize, then I will use
'Kuratowskigrad Revisited' as a tie-breaker, and
award the prize to the person who finds the
smallest number of houses.
Incidentally, I've no idea what the smallest
possible value is; I'll award the prize to the
person who submits a correct solution with the
lowest number of houses.
Many thanks again to Pete and Will, the
managers of Mend-a-Bike, for their continuing
Blanche and Melanie were deep in thought
over a chess game when Wodge entered
the room and wandered over to the board
to watch. Blanche, as usual, was white and
after a few minutes thought, she played a
move, giving the position shown in the
diagram. With more than his customary
politeness, Wodge waited till the game was
over before he started making comments.
"Did you realise that from the position
when I entered the room, Blanche could
force mate in three moves?" he enquired.
Melanie looked suspicious. "Does it use
any of the funny, obscure rules of chess?"
W o d g e l a u g h e d , " t h e o n l y ' f u n n y '
rules, as you call them, are castling and
the en passant rule, and neither of them is
particularly obscure or difficult; they're
just a little surprising when you come across
them unexpectedly in puzzles. But there's
no en passant involved here."
"What about castling?"
"I think y o u ' v e h a d e n o u g h c l u e s , "
grinned Wodge. "Let's see you find this
mate in three."
What was the p o s i t i o n w h e n W o d g e
entered the room? What move did Blanche
play? What should she have played? A n d
how did Wodge deduce that this leads to
mate in three? 'Mate in three', of course,
means that White plays a move, then Black,
then White, then Black, and then White
mates. Melanie (Black)

know where there would be room at the time of
printing this page!)
