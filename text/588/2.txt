Letters to
the Editor
Dear Sir
I must apologise to J M u r p h y
and anybody else too stupid to
see through my 'slip ol the pen' in
describing the arms industry as
' l a b o u r i n t e n s i v e ' i n the last
C N D column. It is of course
capital-intensive, and equivalent
investment in many other indus-
tries such as housing and energy
c o n s e r v a t i o n creates far more
j o b s . H e n c e the c o n n e c t i o n
b e t w e e n the a r m s race a n d
unemployment.
M u r p h y brings out the tired
o l d chestnut a n d accuses I C
C N D o f b e i n g c o m m u n i s t s .
W e ' r e s u p p o r t e d by p e o p l e
r a n g i n g f r o m the left to the
centre, including I C Catholic
C h a p l a i n c y , a n d we a d o p t
neither a pro-Soviet nor pro-
N A T O stance. O n a national
scale the entire Q u a k e r move-
ment is in C N D â€” h a r d l y com-
munists. T o accuse us of being
c o m m u n i s t s is as s t u p i d a n d
irrelevant as if I were to accuse
t h e v o c i f e r o u s r i g h t i n t h e
College of being neo-Nazis or
associated w i t h the N a t i o n a l
Front; a suggestion from which
I'm sure they would recoil in
horror.
Bearing in m i n d the above.
M u r p h y ' s implication that we
are intellectually handicapped is
a joke. I have yet to see any anti-
C N D w r i t e r back his or her
a r g u m e n t s w i t h references to
anything concrete (our leaflets
always contain references); the
standard technique of M u r p h y
and Benita Cortazzi is personal
insult and libellous accusation.
So whose is the intellectual
handicap?
Yours

Dear Sir
We were very surprised to see
that you don't t h i n k we are
boring, it's so nice to know. We
do not agree however, wc think
that the students are very boring,
a n d that F E L I X is too. T h e
standards are so low these days.
The letter from Messrs H a y w a r d
and Hollie is a prime example.
It is meaningless pilllc, it ,ays
nothing. We do not consider that
this sort of purile rubbish (which
was late anyway) is the sort of
thing which should be published
in a p a p e r w h i c h supposedly
caters for a selection of the most
intelligent people in the country.
So much for an active letters
page.
It is also o u r o p i n i o n that
F E L I X relies on too many over-
worked cliches. The 'jokes' are
always the same. The Captain
Lindley joke is a case in point: we
asked h i m h o w m a n y t i m e s
F E L I X had used this joke, and
he said " I don't know, I don't
stand and count 'em, and it's not
up to me to count them either."
Q E D . C a n we have an interest-
ing F E L I X please?
W e do h o p e that y o u are
keeping well, and that you enjoy
your holiday.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
I should like to say that whatever
everybody else thinks, I for one
actually enjoyed reading F E L I X
this year. In a College where
n o t h i n g e v e r h a p p e n s it is
o b v i o u s l y d i f f i c u l t to r u n a
n e w s p a p e r a n d p e r s o n a l l y I
would much rather read about
Bob Pegg selling out than boring
r u b b i s h about b o r i n g U n i o n
allairs. I have also observed that
the p r i n c i p a l a c t i v i t y o f I C
students (apart from drinking)
seems to be making groundless
insults about each other. It would
t h e r e f o r e seem l o g i c a l for a
representative newspaper to do
the same especially since the
letters pages are filled, week-in
week-out, with verbal attacks on
t h e e d i t o r . (It s t r i k e s m e ,
i n c i d e n t a l l y , that such letters
would never be printed in any
other newspaper.) H o w many ol
these critics oiler to write articles
themselves? O r better still, go out
and do something newsworthy. A
spectacular suicide would make a
good story, and I can think of
several people who would benefit
from doing just that. Finally,
since so many people have taken
a stand against your comments
about V i c t o r Mooney. all I can
say is: if G o d had intended us to
eat Mooneys, he would not have
given us tastebuds.

Dear Mr Marshall
I believe your friend calls you
Steve, at the end of M a y a group
of boring students in the middle
of equally boring exams went to
Chiswick Amateur Regatta and
won not just one race but in a
staid unexciting fashion won the
c o m p e t i t i o n by b l a s t i n g the
opposition by more than two
b o a t l e n g t h s in e v e r y r a c e .
Amazed by their own mediocrity
the I C Xovice Four submitted a
suitably ridiculous article which,
despite the fact that I did not
w r i t e i t , you c o n s i d e r e d too
boring lor print.
If being insulting is the only
way to get into F E L I X then I
think you're a sod.

Dear Sir
Today the British Government is
reaping the rewards of a policy of
c o n t i n u a l l y b a c k i n g up the
Loyalist people in Ireland.
Throughout the centuries the
Loyalists have bad their way.
Whenever they demanded any-
thing they got it, eg when they
wanted to divide Ireland they
Were b a c k e d by the B r i t i s h
Government, or whenever they
did not agree to power-sharing
with the Catholic minority, they
opposed it and had their way.
Britain, with this policy has
succeeded in creating one of the
most reactionary' and bigoted
groups of people in the world; the
L o y a l i s t s of N I r e l a n d i n a
spectrum of racism and bigotry
would be classified with other
racists and fascists such as the K u
' K l u x K l a n or Nazis. (For further
reading on this aspect read The
Proles/ants of I Isler by Geolfrey
Bell, a liberal Protestant from N
Ireland. This book analyses the
Loyalist mentality and is a must
for anyone trying to understand
the N Ireland situtation.)
In the early part of this century
the Loyalists were handed the
r e i n s of g o v e r n m e n t of the
a r t i f i c i a l l y created state of N
Ireland. This state was charac-
terized by Orange Pogroms, state
violence and massive discrimina-
tion against the minority com-
munity, not to mention rule by
the same parly for fifty years.
T h e tone of repression in N
Ireland may be guaged from the
fact that M r Vorstere, the South
A f r i c a n m i n i s t e r l o r j u s t i c e
w i s h e d in 1963 for " j u s t one
clause in the N Ireland Special
Powers A c t " in exchange for all
his own coercive legislation.
It was no suprise to read the
contents of M r Boucher's letter in
last week's F E L I X . M r Boucher's
letter' c o n t a i n s that c u r i o u s
mixture of untruths, distortins of
r e a l i t y , p a r a n o i a c o n c e r n i n g
unfavourable opinion of their
"wee Ulster" and tunnel vision
with respect to Republicans, that
is peculiar to the Ulster Loyalist
species.
M r Boucher's statement "that
Loyalist paramilitaries have only
developed in response to the
G o v e r n m e n t ' s n o n - c o m m i t t e d
actions in N Ireland," is untrue.
The British Government began
direct rule in 1972 and the U V F
were murdering innocent Catho-
lics in 1966, eg Gusty Spence,
leader of the U V F , is at present
s e r v i n g a t i l e s e n t e n c e Ib r
murdering a Catholic in 1966.
Furthermore, has M r Boucher
never heard of the ' B ' specials, a
slate c o n t r o l l e d p a r a m i l i t a r y
organisation disbanded by the
British Government embarrassed
by their murderous activities?
M i Bouchers ignorance of the
situation is further exemplified
by the statement that " t h e s e
Loyalists arc not well armed".
The Loyalists own the vast bulk
of the 104.000 l e g a l l y h e l d
firearms certificates in N Ireland,
and have a lotal monopoly on
rifle .clubs. In 1974 the I D A
boasted of having 50.000 men.
The U D R currently have 7.000
full and part-time members, the
R U C have 8.000, the B r i t i s h
A r m y h a v e 1 1.600. not l o
mention the U F F , the U Y F . the
O r a n g e V o l u n t e e r s , the R e d
H a n d C o m m a n d o e s a n d M r
P a i s l e y ' s ( w h o m M r B o u c h e r
refers to as a moderate-
) private
a r m y , r e c e n t l y r e v e a l e d to
journalists on a mountain top.
H o w c a n a n y o n e w i t h a n y
i n t e l l i g e n c e c l a i m t h a t the
Loyalists are not well-armed?
M r Boucher states that the
w o r l d m e d i a are c o n s t a n t l y
"getting it wrong". Has it ever
occurred to M r Boucher that
perhaps they are " g e t t i n g it
right" and that bis views are not
supported anywhere but in N
Ireland and Britain? This is a
classic symptom of the Loyalist
m e n t a l i t y , d i s b e l i e f i n a n y
derogatory comment about their
"wee Ulster", from the world
press.
Finally M r Boucher's state-
ment "that most paramilitaries'
actions are against Republican
sympathies" would be laughable
if the situation was not so serious.
As a vicim of, and witness to
Orange ogroms and assassination
attempts in the early 1970s in N
I r e l a n d , let me a s s u r e M r
Boucher that the only qualifica-
tion necessary for m u r d e r by
L o y a l i s t p a r a m i l i t a r i e s i n N
Ireland is the misfortune to have
been born a Catholic. (For an
analysis of motivation of murders
in N Ireland read Political Murder
in V Ireland, a book published in
the early 1970s.)
I f M r B o u c h e r i n s i s t s o n
writing letters let's hope he gets
his facts right next time.
It is obvious to everyone in the
world except the British Govern-
