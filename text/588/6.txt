Mascotry
Mascotry reared its head this year again.
The first term saw Guilds get City University's
Carrot and then City return to inadvertently
steal John Passmore. It is often claimed that IC
students do not need U L U because theyu
have all the facilities, clubs and societies
necessary in their own College without going
outside. The same could be said of mascotry.
Due to the unique division of C C U s aspiring
mascot violators can practice inside their own
College. This happened in M a r c h when R C S U
violated " D a v e y " the M i n e s mascot. T h e
mascot was taken to an R C S U G M and Mines
repossessed it after an "ugly scene", in May,
R C S U m a d e a s e c o n d a t t e m p t to t a k e
"Davey", this time unsuccessful. Rich Archer,
R C S U President was unaware of most of the
activities of the m a s c o t r y group, a n d his
resignation came as the culmination of a long
period of bitterness.
Rag fortunes this year have fluctuated; a
high attendance for the traditional tiddlywinks
followed by lesser numbers for other events.
The Rag Chairman was forced to resign, but
Rag Week was enjoyed by everyone who took
part.
Boring
Two events that most students don't know a
lot about were Meet IC and I N C O S T . Captain
Lindley organised Meet IC and Liz Lindsay,
I N C O S T . The College would do well to hire
her in two years time for the next Meet IC to
make it more sucessful. Should the Union
r e c i p r o c a t e the g e s t u r e w i t h its n e x t
conference though?
Rachel Snee as Deputy President this year,
has to some extent wasted her abilities in often
unnecessary attacks on F E L I X personnel. She
s e e m s to s p e n d t o o m u c h t i m e b e i n g
"disgusted" to change that which she has been
disgusted about. A s for John Passmore, well,
his leadership could not be called inspired or
d y n a m i c . H e has frequently faced severe
criticism at Union meetings but shrugged it off,
m u c h as he tried to fend off F E L I X . It is
n o t t h o u g h t t h a t a list of the E x e c ' s
achievements this year would be very long,
however, credit is due to them for keeping the
Union ticking over since last year Council this
year has been rather too obsessed with its own
self-importance to be of much use. Fortunately
it has not got bogged down in "political" issues
and the discussion of these matters are usually
brought to a U G M (if its not inquorate!).
Steve Marshall
W i t h o u t a d o u b t t h o u g h , the m o s t
contraversial aspect of the Union this year has
been FELIX.
Steve Marshall has never let a chance slip to
point out the inadequacy and pettiness of
those in College administration and in Union
posts. He has not shied away from defending
the concept of editorial freedom, refusing to be
told what to do by anyone. His editorial reign
has been more concerned with "quality" than
"quantity". H e seems to hold the Union and its
institutions in not inconsiderable disrespect,
and there are very few peeople who can deal
with h i m to their o w n advantage. Steve
Marshall's editorial style has so often resulted
in the n e w s p a p e r b e i n g the n e w s . H i s
campaign against Dare Afolabi whilst being
disgraceful was the talking point of many
groups for some time. The issue that caused
the greatest controversy was at the start of
1981 and concerned the non-awarding of a
knighthood to M r Mooney. All sections of
College felt strongly about that issue either for
or against, and strong pressure was put on
Steve Marshall to apologise to M r Mooney.
H o w e v e r , he p u b l i s h e d an article w h i c h
explained what had happened and this was
accepted as an apology, by Union Council,
even though it showed little sign of remorse or
regret in it.
T h e other major issue w h i c h a r o u s e d
passions were the insulting remarks made by
Steve Marshall about Princess Anne. This
resulted in a motion of N o Confidence in him
being brought to the Hustings U G M . With his
customary disregard for precedent, he refused
to speak in his own defence, but instead had a
statement read on his behalf (which included
criticism of the Exec) in which he offered to
resign there and then. This was a dramatic
move, but the meeting d i d not sieze the
opportunity of throwing him out, however.
It is very difficult to say what the effect of
this year's F E L I X has been. It has been
claimed that F E L I X has made it difficult for the
Union to deal with College. I'm sure the people
in College have more sense than that. FELLX
has been very controversial, and this means
that most people read it, if only to be shocked
by bare b o t t o m s a n d obscenities (for M r
Marshall caters for all tastes). The controversy
that so often surrounds F E L I X "hatchet-job"
can too easily be concerned with the style and
nature of the article, rather than what the
article was about. This is a pity. But at least
Steve Marshall can claim to have published
what the Union really thinks about certain
people and institutions, as exemplified by what
elected representatives are happy to say in
the U n i o n B a r , r a t h e r t h a n o n C o l l e g e
committees.
Handbook Help
Are you multi-talented and staying in or
around College for the summer? If so why not
pop into the F E L I X office and see what's
happening on the IC Union H A N D B O O K .
Whatever you're into we can use you. If you
are a literary genius then you are especially
welcome as articles on eating-out, going-out,
p u b g u i d e e t c . e t c a r e n e e d e d n o w .
So pull your finger out while you've still got
the chance.
