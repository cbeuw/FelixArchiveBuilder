Full team for
Fremantle
Fremantle 4 Rayleigh House 0
For the second time this century
the Fremantle fielded a full team,
this time we also brought some
supporters. The heady cup
atmosphere was so strong that
many of the Fremantle team
realised they were on a football
pitch through the alcoholic blur
caused by the previous nights
FREE drinks Monster and Ghost
Party.
The Fremantle played in their
modified strips of Hawaiian
shirts, anti-glare strips, silly
moustaches, war paint and
horror masks. Fremantle looked
a face to be reckoned with
The oppositon didn't turn up
for half an hour after the
appointed time of 'High Noon at
Hyde Park' but despite our
pleading the ref wouldn't let us
start without them.
The first half was well fought
with Andy 'I spit on Your Grave'
Reeves being forced to dive for
many a blistering shot. The
Fremantle forward line of Rick
'Driller Killer' Alliwell, John
'Incredible Hulk' Heighway,
Steve 'Frankie Stein' Last and
Lewis 'I hate those bastards I
want to rip their bollocks off with
a pair of pliers Westwich, finally
managed to break Rayleigh's
cast iron defence to take an early
lead. By half time the score was
2—0 due to a John 'Hulk'
Heighway shot from a John
'Skull' Baxter cross.
A second half substitution was
Mike 'what's that round thing?'
Grimshaw for Colin 'evil dead'
Irwin. During the second half
Hewett 'Texas chainsaw'
Benson tried time after time to
cross the ball before he ran out of
pitch or got blocked by the
opposition's ringer, 'Louise'
Sterling work in defence from
Ken 'Doctor Phibes Gardiner,
John 'I'm hard, damned hard'
Fitzmorris and John 'Zoltan'
Galloway prevented any
retaliation from Raleigh while
John Heighway scored two mqre
before full time.
The score line reflects only
one thing—large quantities of
free alcohol improve team
performance.
FOOTBALL
Linstead
falls after
3 years
Selkirk Hall created history on
Sunday 27 January when they
became the first team in three
years to beat Linstead Hall.
The first half was played in
snow and only the heroics of Jas
Bodhay in between the posts, the
slick skills of 'Grease' Axelsson
and timely tackles of Simon
McKeeky in defence denied
Linstead their numerous
chances and kept the score
sheet down to 1-2. Linstead went
The second half was all
Selkirk, with almost complete
dominance in midfield by
Bridger, 'Grease', Mike 'Stud'
Birmingham and Robert Ingham.
The icing on the snow for Selkirk
came when 'Rubber Legs' Ming
scored a mere five minutes from
time to make it Selkirk three and
Linstead two."
TABLE TENNIS
Victory
Both the first and second teams
won their matches this last week.
The first team played at home to

outdone, two days later the

second team who both won all
