UGC visit IC
The U n i v e r s i t y Grants
Committee (UGC) visited the
College last Wednesday on a fact
finding mission, and met
students, welfare officials, non-
academic staff, academic staff
and senior administrative staff,
in order that the full cross-section
of interests at IC was
represented.
The UGC is responsible for
allocating the total grant made
available by the DES to
universities and to advise the
government of their financial
needs.
The twenty members of the
UGC are appointed by the
Education Minister. Most are
academics, but they serve in an
individual capacity—ncine
represents any particular
interest.
The purpose of their five-
yearly visits is to discover more
about the present requirements
and special problems of the
College.
The various interest groups,
including IC Union, were able to
make representations to the
UGC. The Union delegation
consisted of the Sabbatical
Officers, and other Union
Officers associated with
academic, sport and overseas
student affairs.
The Union made three
presentation to the UGC, in a 45
minute session.
On sport and recreation
facilities the Union pointed out
the inadequacies of the present
facilities.
The problems faced by
overseas students, particularly
the arbitrarily set high fees, were
highlighted. The related
problems of i s o l a t i o n ,
compounded by the cost of
living, were brought home.
Thirdly the broader, and more
problematic area of accomm-
odation, travel and the student
grant were emphasised. The extra
expense and problems associated
with living, studying and
travelling in London were
brought to the attention of the
UGC, particulary those members
who did not fully understand the
implications of living in cnetral
London.
Some of these problems were
also covered in presentations by
the other interest groups,
particularly welfare.
While showing sympathy, the
Chairman, Sir Peter Swinnerton-
Dyer, said that there was little the
UGC could do about these
problems.
On accommodation he said
that both sports buildings and
student residence were of low
priority. The UGC recognizes
that even loan-financed building,
feasible in the provinces, is out of
the question in London.
As for overseas students Sir
Peter said that Imperial doesn't
charge as much as other
institutions, and bearing in mind
its position as a centre of
excellence it ought to be charging
more.
The concluding session of the
day involved the UGC meeting
representatives of the Governing
Body in order that the UGC
could make general points and
respond to points raised during
the day.
Sir Peter said that the UGC
had received a silent response
from the Government on level
funding. His best guess for the
financial future of the
universities was a 1.5% to 2% pa
cut in real terms. This would
continue until the Government
realised how much damage they
were causing, or the situation
changed due to the decline in
student numbers.
The UGC re-affirmed its
commitment to an increased
degree of selectivity, primarily on
the basis of quality of research.
He added that IC will be
confident to benefit from such
selectivity: the question was
'Would IC continue to be
favourably funded, or become
even more favourably funded?'
On PhD submission rates Sir
Peter said that IC was no better
or worse than average, but was
considerably worse than
Cambridge, and ought to be
asking itself why. Perhaps IC
may expect too much of its
students by way of volume as well
as quality, he thought, and there
was too much emphasis on the
advancement of knowledge.
The question of relating the
block vote to research contract
income was raised. Sir Peter said
'My own philosophy would be To
him that hath shall be given. My
perception of the Secretary of
State's attitude is We shall not
actually look andsee what you get,
but we will estimate what you
ought to be able to get.''
New code for
PhD students
A new code of practice for the
guidance of research supervisors
and PhD students has been
produced by the vice chancellors'
committee on academic quality
and standards, which deals with
admission of research degrees,
choice of research topic,
supervisor and final exam-
inations.
The code proposes that a
statement on the subject of
supervision is sent to both
student and supervisor before
research begins outlining their
duties and responsibilities. The
responsibilities of the supervisor
would include giving guidance on
the nature of research and the
standard expected; maintaining
contact with the student through
regular tutorial and seminar
meetings; being accessible to give
advice; requesting written work
and returning it with constructive
criticism; giving details of
completion dates of particular
stages of work and pointing out
any inadequacies.
The students responsibilities
would include discussion with
the supervisor about the type of
guidance which is helpful, taking
the initiative in raising any
problems; maintaining progress
of the work; providing an annual
report to the head of department
and deciding when to submit the
completed work.
The statement should also
include a procedure to be
followed if an effective working
relationship is not formed.
On the subject of final
examinations, it is proposed that
the examiner's recommendation
should take one of the following
forms: immediate award of the
degree; award after minor
amendment made to the
satisfaction of the internal
examiner; revision and re-
submission; formal submission
for a lower degree or rejection
with no right of re-submission.
