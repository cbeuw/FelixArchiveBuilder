Camborne g o
on rampage
The cancellation last weekend of the RSM rugby and
hockey matches against the Camborne School of Mines
allowed no escape for the bottled up energy which erupted
into near-riotous behaviour by the Camborne Miners
causing several hundred pounds worth of damage.
The visit was for the annual
weekend of sporting fixtures
which is held alternately at
Camborne and IC.
Trouble first started during a
dinner in College which resulted
in one person being taken to
hospital with glass in his eye, and
a waitress at the meal being
pelted with cooked tomatoes.
After dinner the Camborne
miners went on the rampage, first
through the R S M building
knocking photographs off walls
and climbing out through
windows before going on to
Southside where a window was
broken and the electric lock on
the door leading to the bar was
damaged.
A bill for the damage has been
forwarded by Geoffrey Reeves,
College Security Officer, to the
Royal School of Mines as they
were the hosts. It is not known
whether the Cambbrne miners
will be asked to pay for any
damage.
In a statement to F E L I X ,
Geoffrey Reeves said, 'it's the
behaviour that we expect from
Miners and they'll have to pay for
it.'
Estates decision
reversed
Willis Jackson House will not
now be evacuated this month
following representations by
ICU President, Ian Bull to senior
members of College.
The original plans to begin
improvement work at the end of
February have been dropped and
it has been agreed that
improvements will only be
carried out during vacations so
that there will be no disruption to
students.
As previously reported in
F E L I X all houses in Evelyn
Gardens need improvement
including installation of fire
doors and fire escapes. So far
only one order for work to be
carried out has been served by the
Royal Borough of Kensington
and Chelsea, however their
Housing Officer has agreed to
postpone any action after
hearing that students will have to
be moved out.
Improvements to Willis
Jackson House will begin during
the Easter vacation and should
be completed during the summer
vacation. It is not known how
long it will take to bring all the
houses in Evelyn Gardens up to
the standard required by the
Housing Acts.
Who dares win
The President of I C U has been
mandated to check as many Daily
Mirror bingo cards as possible to
help allievate the Union's finance
problems, following a motion
that was passed at last Tuesday's
U G M .
The meeting opened ten
minutes late, and was chaired by
Chris Hendy in the absence of the
usual chairman, Sean Davis, who
was fast asleep.
All the officers reports were
accepted, and the meeting moved
on to the changes in the Union
By-Laws. A small amendment to
part of the changes proposed by
Ann Collins R C S U President was
passed, despite Eric Darbyshire
H o n Sec saying that the
amendment was trivial and
would not change the meaning or
alter the c l a r i t y of the
constitution. This section of the
changes will now not become
effective until it has been passed
at a U G M next term.
The motion on Union Finance
proposed by Grenville Manuel
Computing 1 was debated next.
A procedural amendment was
put forward by Alan Rose to
change the word 'President' to
'Mr G Manuel' throughout
which would force M r Manuel to
check the bingo cards. This was
very narrowly defeated, and after
a few questions the motion itself
was carried almost unanimously,
with only Ian Bull ICU President
voting against it.
Following this J Martin Taylor
introduced some changes to the
election rules to clarify some
points about publicity and close
some loopholes.
Ian Bull has so far been
disappointed with the response
of students passing on bingo
cards to him. Anyone wishing to
help Union finances should take
cards up to the Union office.
Pictured above are Michael Newman (an ex-student at IC), Adrian
Henri and Ralph Steadman. Mr Steadman showed slides of his
pictures from a forthcoming book to ICCND on Thursday. He also
donated an autographed print which is to be the prize in the ICCND
art competition. Adrian Henri read several ofhis poems about peace,
war and love.
