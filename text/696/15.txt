More rag mag success
The second RCSU rag mag
selling tour, which took place last
weekend, raised £750 for Rag
during visits to eight universities
and one polytechnic.
The team of eighteen started
off early on Saturday morning
visiting Brunei University Halls
only to find lots of bleary eyed
students who seemed to be more
interested in the appearance of
four inches of snow outside their
windows, than in buying rag
mags.

From Brunei, the two
minibuses went on to
Southampton and Portsmouth
where most students pretended
to be poor and blamed it on the
Government. After lots of beer in
a local bar, a mega curry and
about three hours sleep the team
left Portsmouth en route to
Exeter where they found a lot of
very rich snobbish students, most
of whom wouldn't lower
themselves to buy a 'cheap rag
mag'.

The last day of the tour,
proved to be the most successful
as Cardiff and Swansea students
were very friendly and didn't
refuse when asked to buy a rag
mag. En route home from Wales
the minibus hit the Reading
University halls very hard and
very successfully before arriving
back at the Union bar by 9.30pm
on Monday night—just in time
for a few (dozen) beers.

During his recent stay in hospital
for tests after injuring his spleen,
FELIX Editor Dave Rowe was
amazed at the concern for his
welfare shown by senior
members of the College
hierarchy. Such notables as John
Smith (College Secretary) and
Linda Davies (College Press
Officer) trekked to his bedside.
However, the real reason for
their visits was revealed when
Dave had a visit from no less a
person than the Rector,
resplendent in Japanese kimono
who was recovering in a ward
three floors above Dave's from a
heart attack (myocardial
insurrection).
Whilst the two most important
men in College were both in St.
Stephens hospital at the same
time recently, it seems that a
small side-bet was struck
between Union President Ian
Bull and College Secretary John
Smith over which of their
respective betters would be out
first.
FELIX Editor Dave Rowe was
home within a few days meaning
Ian was the winner, and so John
Smith was obliged to visit the
Union Office with a couple of
bottles of Taitinger champagne
to be shared amongst probably
the most exclusive gathering in
the Union this year. Asked
afterwards if he thought the
champagne a good vintage Ian
commented that it tasted 'pretty
good' to him, but that the main
benefit of the meeting was the
chance to persuade Mr Smith to
give the Union a recurrent
champagne allowance for next
year.
