^REVIEWED
SINGLES
Kim Carnes
I confess to only really
knowing one Kim Carnes
s o n g , Bette Davis Eyes.
Invitation to Dance is nothing
like that so I'll have to
comment as if I'd never heard
of Miss Carnes. This could be
a really good single—soulful
funk if rather 70's disco
s t y l e — u n f o r t u n a t e l y t h e
chorus of 15 Invitation to
Dance's would put anyone off.
David Bowie: This Is Not
America
I find it very difficult to take
this seriously. After seeing his
puppet on Spitting Images
last Sunday, I keep imagining
Bowie in the back of a taxi with
s w i v e l l i n g e y e s . I don't
actually believe this could be
described as in any way a
classic Bowie track though
—the man has a great voice
but not on bland songs like
this.
Play Dead: Sacrosanct
This will be the first time
you'll have heard of this
Oxford Band and probably
will be the last, certainly if they
carry on producing rubbish
likethis. It's likea male version
of Toyah, without a tune.
Horrible.
Musical Choirs: Australia
Someone handed me this
Postman Pat EP in a party a
couple of weeks back, and I
promised to spin it on my
radio show. When I listened to
it however, I was sure it
deserved the full review
treatment. Musical Chairs are
a college band and from the
sound of the production,
recorded this in someone's
b a c k r o o m . A l t h o u g h
overblown mikes can be
annoying this doesn't really
detract form a great sound.
The best way Lean describe
it is as a quieter version of J
Gejls Band plus synths. It's
dead good.
DANCE
Janet
Smith
It is important to remember
t h a t b a l l e t ( e s p e c i a l l y
contemporary dance) is not
purely there for its 'meaning'
but is (as with many art forms)
there for the pleasure or
sensations it gives you. It is a
v e r y e f f e c t i v e w a y of
conveying an atmosphere or
feeling rather than a meaning,
statement or thought. It is not
pretensious then.
'Janet Smith and dancers' is
a small touring dance group
and is made up of individuals
who, although may not dance
so rythmically and well in a
group, dance well as solo
performers. Personally, I don't
enjoy plain ballet, but with
more interesting music, sets
and themes I find c o n -
temporary ballet can be very
e n j o y a b l e a n d t h r i l l i n g .
Almost ecstatic when seen
live.
A small group like this
would not work as 'Rites of
Spring' but can perform very
g o o d s m a l l e r d a n c e s .
'Another man Drowning' is a
pensive dance, inspired by L S
Lowry's paintng, with colours
and sets reminicent of that
life. The appropriately clothed
d a n c e r s l i v i n g o u t a
'humdrum' existance to a
mixture of rhythmic sound
effects, music and nonsense
verse. Ending, as the central
characters's life just falls
apart, with a vision of the sea
that actually made me feel I
was there. That deserted
beach seemed very real.
Other dancers are more
enjoyable and even funny.
Some of the dances have
c h o r e o g r a p h e d their own
pieces and they are inter-
esting, themeic and show
promise (although I am hardly
an expert to comment).
T h e d a n c e r s w i l l be
presenting two programs of
dance at 'The Place' theatre
E u s t o n , f r o m 1 9 - 2 3 of
February and they are worth
seeing.
