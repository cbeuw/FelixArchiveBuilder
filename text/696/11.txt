This weeks puzzle is of a different kind to those I have used so
far.
George and Jason have each written essays for their English
teacher. Punctuate the following remark.
'George whereas Jason had had had had had had had had
had had had the teachers approval'.

There were 15 correct solution to last fortnights puzzle even
though there were no extra clues from the fortnight before,
when it had been unsolved.
As I said initially the puzzlewas really quite easy to do and the
majority found the quick way of doing it.
Initially the profs marked the corners of circa 100 by 100yard
square. As they follow each other they indeed spiral inwards
meeting at the tower, but by symmetry they always remain at the
corners of a square, centred on the tower. Since each Prof
follows someone whose velocity is perpendicular to their own,
they approach each other at precisely one yard/second: their
walking speed.
Thus they all reach the tower after circa 100s.
Howard Rudd a Chemistry P G won the prize and may collect
his £5 cheque from the FELIX office after Wednesday.
