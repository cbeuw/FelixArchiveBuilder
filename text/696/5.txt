This is the first in a series of articles trying to raise Joe Student's awareness of the
things going on within 100 yards of IC. There are students who leave the College
without even going into the Science Museum, never mind some of the less well
known parts of South Kensington. People travel thousands of miles to visit these
places—we only have to travel a few yards!

The British Library National
Sound Archive is the UK's
largest public reference of sound
recordings. It holds over 500,000
discs and enough tape to run for
two and a half years, as well as
thousands of discographies and
books on sound recordings. If
you want to look at a copy of the
Radio Times from 1948 or hear
the mating call of an Orang-
Utang then the BLNSA is on
your doorstep. As it's name
suggests the BLNSA is a part of
the British Library, and it
employs 40 staff in it's imposing
premises at 29 Exhibition Road,
although it is expanding by
taking on additional property in
Princes Gardens. It started life as
a collection of classical music
recordings, but has now
broadened it's coverage to all
forms of sound recording. It
holds the world's second largest
collection of wildlife sounds, as
well as collections of jazz, pop,
opera, ethnic and voice
recordings. The recordings are
on every medium conceivable,
from wax cylinders and Pianola
rolls to digitally recorded
compact disks, including some
that never became popular such
as paper tape, metal wire and
discs spinning at 16 rpm.
Although the library does not
ha-ve lending facilities their
collection is undoubtedly a
national asset, and more to the
point it is right next to Imperial
College and the facilities are
there to be used. The library
offers a free listening service,
with introductory tapes giving
details of some of the many
services it offers. Recordings can
be heard in a special listening
room. A particularly interesting
early recording is that made by W
E Gladstone the Victorian Prime
Minister in 1889, although the
recordings are by no means
purely historical. Copies of over
60% of the discs issued in the UK
are deposited in the archives, and
the library tapes extensively from
the BBC under a special licence.
All the subject curators are
experts in their field, so the
library can offer an Information
Service, helping to track down
recordings, and it is installing a
new computer system to help in
this task. If someone feels that
a particular recording of theirs
has a particular historical value
then they may submit it for
inclusion in the libraries archive.
There are superb facilities for
looking after recordings, and
state-of-the-art equipment is
used extensively. Visitors are
often surprised to see the
technology that has to be used to
squeeze the last ounce of sound
out of an old recording. For
instance a custom built cylinder
player using silicon chips
replaces a device that originally
would have run by clockwork
and had a mahogany case.
When it takes on it's new
premises in Princes Gate the
library intends to mount a
permanent audio-visual
exhibition. Among the exhibits
will be a phonogram owned by
George Bernard Shaw. So if you
want to hear a particularly rare
Charlie Parker 78 or just perfect
your Geordie accent so you can
do impersonations of your
Tyneside friends then visiting the
BLNSA means just taking a short
walk down Exhibition Road.
