The New Year's Carnival on
Monday night was the scene for
some over enthusiastic behaviour
amongst the new crop of freshers.
The main band of the
evening, Salad, were playing
when it became apparent that
about thirty moshers dancing at
the front were starting to impinge
onto the stage. Two union stew-
ards tried to regain some measure
of control but it became apparent
that they were insufficient. Several
minutes later more stewards
which will take place in London,
aims to attract 10,000 people. In
an open letter, ULU President
Gemma Williams stated her inten-
tion to "rid London of its pitiful
reputation for attendance at such
events."
Many Colleges are organising
events such as hardship discos to
take place in the fortnight leading
up to the event.
to devote to DramSoc. Many soci-
eties can demand heavy commit-,
ment, although not everyone finds
it to be a problem.
"I was President and it never
did me any harm," claims Dan
Shields, who has now begun a
Ph.D after successfully completing
his Electrical Engineering degree.
"If people audition and get a part
in a play, then there are two
evening rehearsals per week," he
explains.
However, despite an effort to
avoid exam periods, the level of
required attendance escalates as
the play approaches.
DramSoc are planning two
significant productions this term:
"Hamlet" and "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead".
arrived to form a human barrier
between the crowd and the stage.
However during the encore,
Salad's lead singer suggested that,
the stewards should move away
and let everyone have a good
time. This caused a crowd surge
resulting in several stewards being
pushed over onto the stage. In the
confusion one member of the
audience managed to grab the
front, of the singer's trousers.
Order was quickly regained and
Salad managed to finish their
encore. The rest of the New Year's
Carnival passed off smoothly.
Green Research
A Graduate School of the
Environment is to be formed at
Imperial College. The formation
of the new School was recom-
mended in a review conducted by
Sir John Mason into how the
College might best coordinate-
ordinate its activities and strength
in the fields of environmental sci-
ence, engineering and technology.
The Rector accepted the recom-
mendation and steps are currently
being taken in order to implement
the decision.
The School will be the first
Graduate School at Imperial
College and its relationship with
academic departments will largely
be one of coordination and open-
ing up of opportunities.
Medical Merger
A new plan may see King's College
merging with United Medical
Schools of St. Guys and St.
Thomas'.
The proposal has been
approved by the governing body
of King's College, and is awaiting
the Government's decision which
should arrive in January. If the
merger goes ahead the school will
be based at King's College Medical
School's current site at, London
Bridge.
Appointment
Mineral Resources Engineering
has a new Head of Department.
Professor John D Woods, CBE
starts his five year term as of 1st
November 1994.
Professor Woods (55) is a
graduate of Imperial College hold-
ing a B.Sc and Ph.D in Physics.
He is currently the director of
Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
at the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC).
Professor Woods also holds the
post of NERC Research Professor
at the Clarendon Laboratory, and
is a fellow of Linacre College
Oxford.
Professor Woods will also
become the first, appointed Dean
of the Graduate School of the
Environment.
Design Initiative
A new scheme was launched yes-
terday to enhance the teaching of
engineering design at Imperial.
Imperial College and the
Royal Academy of Engineering are
embarking on a four year pro-
gramme to improve teaching
through a collaborative initiative
with industry. As part of an
Academy-funded scheme, five
senior industrial engineers will
become 'visiting professors in the
principles of engineering design'
at Imperial College. The role of
the visiting professors is to
demonstrate to students and staff
that design is the integrating
theme in all the engineering disci-
plines within the university.
The scheme was implement-
ed initially in 1989 and is sup-
ported by the OST, DTI and a
number of engineering companies
and institutions.
Graduate Employment
job prospects for graduates are
improving according to a study of
large employers published over
the summer vacation.
The Association of Graduate
Recruiters surveyed two hundred
member organisations and found
that, on average, firms expected
to show an increase of 4.2 per
cent, in the number of new gradu-
ates employed.
The survey supported
Government figures released in
June that showed the first fall in
graduate unemployment in five
years.
Course Credit
A North American-style credit-
based degree is to be developed
by thirty-three higher education
institutions in the South East of
England.
The South East. England
Consortium for Credit.
Accumulation and Transfer
(SEEC) includes the University of
London. It aims to establish a
nation credit framework which
can take in foreign students and
offer a sound system of guidance
for students.
