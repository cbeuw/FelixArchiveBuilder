Informed
Silence
BY DAVID COHEN
It emerged this week that St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
appears to be at the centre of a
financial scandal. Last weekend
the Mail on Sunday reported
about a "hospital cashier who
gambled away £650,000 of stolen
money". The cashier, Mr Cyril
D'Souza, is alleged to have embez-
zled monies over the past 12 years.
St Mary's has been part of
Imperial since 1988, and over the
past few years has been progres-
sively integrated into the Imperial
system. Recently an internal finan-
cial audit was completed at St
Mary's and irregularities were
found. Apparently, three weeks
ago, Mr Cyril D'Souza, a cashier at
the medical school, was called in
to see St Mary's managers. He is
said to have confessed to theft
amounting to £652,840.58. Mr
D'Souza refused to comment to
F E L I X . However last week the
Mail on Sunday quoted him as
saying "I suppose you could say I
was gambling crazy".
According to the Mail on
Sunday's investigations Mr
D'Souza lives in an ex-council flat,
valued now at around £30,000 so
it seems that he would be able to
repay only a minute fraction of the
stolen money. It has all been lost
on gambling flings, allegedly. But,
sources have revealed to F E L I X
that Imperial College might
attempt to make an insurance
claim against an employee fraud
insurance policy which covers the
College against such situations. At
the moment College management
are unwilling to comment.
When interviewed by F E L I X
Mr Angus Fraser, Managing
Director of Imperial College, said
that "No member of the College
will comment on the case... and I
am not going to comment either
on any point, in the article [in The
Mail on Sunday]". He added that
no further information will be
released until the Police investiga-
tion comes to a conclusion. The
College Executive Committee
meets today (Friday) when the
remaining governors who are not
aware of the situation may be
informed.
The prudence with which
Imperial College management, is
handling this case is note worthy
as absolutely every College
employee approached by F E L I X
has declined to comment on the
details of the investigation.
Although it seems that the
matter is in hand, the question
remains: If the money isn't
regained how will the loss be dealt
with? Both Lucy Chothia (Union
President) and Mike Hansen
(Director of Finance) conceeded
that the Student Union will not be
affected in any way by the inci-
dent. Mr Fraser reiterated this
reassurance. However, it is not
clear whether the student body —
as a whole — will or will not be
affected. The situation will be
reassessed when the affair has
been concluded.
F E L I X will be following the
developments in the case.
Bike Clampdown
BY MIKE INGRAM
College Security are initiating a
new campaign to clamp down on
the wave of bicycle theft sweeping
the College.
On Monday, College Security
began distributing "Lock it or
Lose it" leaflets to cyclists entering
the campus. Notices about the
recent spate of thefts have also
been distributed.
At the end of last month,
College Security reported at least,
two groups of youths acting suspi-
ciously around the bike racks.
Bicycle owners are being
urged to to get their bicycles coded
at a police station or the soon-to-
be-announced Crime Prevention
Presentation at. Imperial. All acces-
sories should be removed before
parking bikes, and 'D-Lock's
should be used to secure them.
These can be bought from room
150 in the Sherfield Building.
As always, any suspicious
activity within College should be
reported to Security on extension
58900.
