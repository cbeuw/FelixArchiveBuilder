The Dramatic: Society (DramSoc)
is one of Imperial's liveliest
societies: last year we put. on six
productions, helped out with loads
of overseas societies' events and all
the carnivals. In addition to that
we build and run our own venue
at the Edinburgh festival. So to
start of this year we're running
two productions: Hamlet and
Tom Stopparcl's Rosencranlz and
Ouildestem are Dead.
Hamlet's tragic tale is well
known. Hamlet, Prince of
Denmark, plots revenge against
his uncle the King for the murder
of his father but slowly others are
drawn into the plot, leading
ultimately to a tragic conclusion.
Rosenerantz and Guildeiistern
are swept of their feet by the plot
of Hamlet. Where once their world
was rilled by chance now (heir
future is pre-destined. Both arc
confused by the change and

it, now the time has come?

are to be held on Sunday 9th in
the Ents disco and on Tuesday
11 th in the concert hall both at
5pm. As well as actors we require
technical people too. Set, designers

be. Our first, technical workshop

FilmSoc: Schindler's List
The film that not only relives history hut creates it can be seen tiiis
Sunday at 8pm showing ICU Cinema. The depiction of Oskar
Schindler, an enterprising opportunist, trying to come to terms
with the madness of the holocaust, makes use of some of the most,
vivid imagery that is ever likely to grace the cinema screen.
Spielberg's artistry is just one of the many features of this epic film.
A horrific event that should not be forgotten, is covered with tact
whilst showing the scale of Hitler's genocide.
