The Ultimate
Challenge?
The Rugby Sesason is well under
way for all of those men with odd
shaped balls, but, what on earth
is wrong with women playing
with odd shaped balls? Not only
is it a great way to get fit, but it is
a fantastic laugh. We are called
the IC Virgins and field one team,
train on Sundays at 12pm either
in Hyde Park or at Harlington
and twice during the week.
Games are played on Sundays.
Last year we had a collection of
fixtures both home and away,
and a Rag match against the
strapping lads of the RSM Rugby
team. Not only was it a good
fundraiser, but we managed to
draw the match at, 26-26, but.
were narrowly beaten at the boat
race, which took place later. This
year, we are. going to win both.
The only down side is that
we do not. have enough players to
always field a full team, so we, are
looking for any enthusiastic
women willing to try out.
something new, exciting and very
enjoyable. Our first training
session is on Stmday the 9th of
October, meeting at 12pm in Beit
Quad. Trainers and some, sort of
Sports kit is all that, is needed.
Incidentally, we enjoy a full
and varied social scene, sing our
own Rugby songs and dress up
nicely and go out for a civilised
(?) meal together. If you are
looking for the "Ultimate,
Challenge", then this is for you.
If you have, any questions at.

Aternatively, see you on Sunday
at. 12pm in Beit Quad.

Test your Constitution?
What's going on?
The Union is in the process of
writing a new constitution. This
document, in whatever form it is
finally passed, will be the fund-
amental document on which our
Union conducts its affairs. This is
probably the, most far reaching re-
write that it has had in recent
times and builds on the exper-
iences of the, last, two years. This
version of the constitution has
been written over the summer
with significant College input
before being agreed with our
current Executive Committee.
What are these changes?
This is the main purpose of this
article, to explain what, some of the
largest changes are and the
concepts behind them. Many of
the changes have been made
necessary by the new Education
Act, some by consultation with
College and many initiated by
members of the Union themselves.
The SRC
The Student Representative
Council has been designed to be
the policy making body of IC
Union. In fulfiling this role it
replaces the Union General
Meeting (UGM) of the old
constitution. UGM's are notor-
iously vulnerable to groups of
people turning up and block
voting issues through which could
be against, the interests of the rest,
of the membership. It was felt that
the introduction of the, SRC would
provide greater democracy.
Fundamentally it is not unlike
the UGM in that any student can
attend and have their say in the
running of the Union. In order to
counter the problem of block
voting it has a core of around fifty
The. three office sabbaticals would
like to thank:
Mandy: The day before our
first function in Da Vinci's the
ceiling came down due to a large
leak in the, heating system. Whilst
the, rest of us were panicking
Mandy (our Union Manager) got,
the ceiling replaced in a little over
24 hours.
Sam: Sam has worked
tirelessly organising the various
events in the Union this week and
deserves a huge pat on the, back.
Michelle & Adele:
Throughout, this week Michelle
and Adele have managed to stay
on top of things all AND be
reasonably relaxed with it!
Everyone Else! What has
impressed us as newcomers to the
office is the, way everybody,
without, exception, pulls together.
One final mention for Ian and
his organisation of Freshers Fair
Well played mate!
people who are the only voting
members. These are all elected
representatives of different areas of
the Union thus insuring that as
wide a variety of views as possible
are, represented at, the SRC.
However, in order to ensure
the SRC is accountable to the
student body an Extraordinary
General Meetings can be called at
any time. The work of the SRC is
also reviewed by an Annual
General Meeting at the end of the
year.
The composition of the SRC is
still under debate, with one of the
liveliest issues likely to be wether
or not it should include a
representative from each hall.
Those in favour of their inclusion
believe that this will increase the
participation of first year students
in the Union. Those against their
inclusion believe that some of these
Hall Reps arc, unlikely to regularly
attend meetings leading to
problems in achieving quorum
(the number of people needed
before a meeting may open). It is
also felt that it may be unfair to a
greater representation to those
who live in hall.
The Executive Committee
(Exec)
This committee is intended to
coordinate the management of the
Union and as such it. is not a
representative body. It, is designed
as a committee composed of
people interested in the running of
the, Union who have already been
elected by the membership to
specific posts. It is proposed that it
should consist of the President,
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies), Deputy President,
(Finance & Services), the Pres-
ident, of each Constituent College,
Union and four other Union
Officers elected at SRC. This
composition is similar to the old
Exec except for the four extra
Union Officers who have been
bought on to increase the breadth
of expertise of its members.
Financial Regulations
During consultation with College it,
became clear that our Financial
Regulations needed to be looked at
especially in the light of the new
Education Act, which sets out
specific requirements for the
operation of, reporting on and
accountability for students' union
finances. Some aspects of the
resulting new financial respon-
sibilities and procedures are
outlined in the constitution and are
then dealt with more thoroughly in
the Appendices.
In rewriting parts of these,
regulations we, have attempted to
make the Union more accountable
to the students through form-
alising the publication of regular
financial reports (in accordance
with the Act). A large amount of
effort also went into more clearly
defining chains of financial
responsibility within the Union
and consequently the role of
various committees within the
Union's Finances.
These three issues are the
main areas where the, constitution
has been significantly altered,
however their are many other
small changes which we will be
happy to discuss with you at, any
time.
So, what can you do about it?
Firstly, come and have a look at a
copy. Sitting down and reading a
copy is by far the quickest, way of
finding out what, the constitution is
actually about. Copies are
available to any student at the
Union Office.
Secondly, come and talk to
us. If anyone, is unhappy with any
of the points we have raised or
requires more information on
anything else in this proposed
constitution please, come in for a
chat about it. It is vital that the
constitution that is passed by the
Union is right, for the students of
Imperial College.
Thirdly, have your say. This
constitution goes to its first Union
General Meeting on Friday 14th
October at, 12.00pm (Ents
Lounge). Being there is probably
the easiest, way you can have a say
as to the direction our Union takes
in the future. There will be a
limited amount of time at this
meeting, so in order to have your
points considered fully please try
and discuss them with us first.See
you all soon...
