The First world war was a time of
birth and death on an unspeakable
scale. It was the birth of the
machine age, the birth of horror
and of truth. It heralded the death
of innocence, of peace of mind and
of the millions whose lives were
senselessly wasted in carnage. To
express the sickening scale of the
destruction of that time is a difficult
task indeed, but one that has been
managed admirably in the new
exhibition, A Bitter Truth at the
Barbican. With over two hundred
paintings, prints and sculptures on
display it takes you through the
time of the war, from the initial
pugilistic enthusiasm of the artists
and the populace to the
disillusionment, despair and mental
damage of the aftermath. Many
well known painters are on display
from Britain and Germany, most
notably the bleak, angular
landscapes of Nash, but many
lesser known artists provide
outstanding works from that time.
The path of the exhibition takes
you through the time of the war to
give an understanding of the
changes that took place in the
conflict and the attitudes of the
artists. Before the start of the
fighting, the Futurists glorified
battle as the only way of producing
aesthetic excellence, but by the end
many previously abstract artists had
turned to realism in order to
express their horror at the scenes
around them. The greatest insight
was provided by various paintings
by Otto Dix. In 1914, a self portrait
showed him eager for blood, strong
and determined. Later he
represented himself in his 'Portrait
as a shooting target'. In 1924, his
drawings became filled with
decomposition, collapse and death,
as he attempted to comprehend the
past in the only way he could.
This exhibition is intense, dark
and disturbing; but it is also deeply
necessary, and provides a
remarkable insight into events
which few today can remember first
hand. It does not deserve to be
missed.

Whereas the only other Japanese
band of note, Shonen Knife,
manage not to play their
instruments, but be endearing and
produce jap-pop, the Boredoms
trash their instruments, bemuse
people and produce jap-core.
Heavily fuelled by their
S i a m e s e twins bashing away on
outside drum kits, the Boredom
rollercoaster is directed by a lead
vocalist who obviously took
lessons from the Rollins school of
shouting. He was probably a extra
in Karate Kid too, considering his
propensity to jump off loudspeaker
stacks in the crane position, to the
accompaniment of crashing
drums. On occasions i n the set
one drummer sacrificed her
crashing to shriek on a trumpet,
the third drummer-cum-wailer
sometimes pretended to have
appendicitis; yeah the Boredoms
are a heady mix of that all that is
unpredictable..
As for old bands with new
things to say, there are few with
the lineage of Bob Mould. From
Husker DO to solo Mould and the
currently ironic 'file under easy
listening' Sugar, he has borne the
brunt of a rock'n'roll lifestyle and
still come out smiling.
Live, Sugar know exactly
what steps they have to take and
proceed to take them all with
running strides. Melodies go the
way of all speed with Bob a clumsy
figure wheeling around the stage
under the direction of Malcolm
Travis' stinging bass. Even the old
favourites from 'Copper Blue' were
mixed with a live vigour that
reinvented them. 'Changes' was
almost over before I realised what
it was and the supposedly 'radio
friendly unit shifting' 'if I can't
change your mind' came out as a
blazing shade of noise. Two
encores ending on 'walking away'
and the only words Bob said were
'goodnight'. Outside it was raining
and October but that night our
dreams were vivid.

Anoraks, trousers flapping 3" above
the ankle, sandals and overgrown
beards - these are regular, heart
warming sights at IC, London. For
the really fashion conscious, there
are rugby shirts, shoulder pads, pale
jeans and pony tails. After two years
at IC, the nagging thought that
one's surrounding tend to influence
one's dress sense has developed
into full scale terror. Thus, out of
fear for the future of my street cred.,
here it is - a last brave attempt to
turn the tide, wage war on
academia, and bring to you the
FELIX Fashion File: a definite guide
to London Streetware. Will you
continue wearing pale green skirts
with scarlet tights and Court shoes
(boys!) or will you turn to the new,
slick, individual styles of the 90s?
And for the conservatives, don't fear.
Grey is the fashionable colour this
season. Bring back from your attics
the old school tank top and tie, then
nip down to my recommended
places and put a ring through your
eyebrow. Easy.
Once arrayed in your new-look
attire, choose from a sparkling list of
fashionable 'nite-spots' and prepare
to hit the town. Each review will
included the best ways to get there,
prices on the door and at the bar,
which doorman is hardest to impress
and the best shops for hometime
munchies.
This column is intended to give
some pointers to the opportunities
of London shopping and living
(obviously the same thing). Forced
into this varied and fascinating city
for at least three years, many
students never really seem to
appreciate the richness of their
surroundings. As a complete sad
London fanatic, this is my poor
excuse to run round the city
spending a student loan and then
drivel on enthusiastically each week.
So arrange your overdrafts, trim
down your beards, get out the silver
lycra and enjoy.
