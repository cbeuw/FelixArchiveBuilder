Who are they? Where did they
come from? What are they doing
to the minds of precious young cyberpunks?
With our secret network of hidden cameras and
crack surveillance team, we investigate the truth
behind the 140-year-old facade that exists on our
doorstep. The National Museum of Science and
Industry in Exhibition Road is home to the world's
finest collection of tech-history. Built from the pro-
ceeds of the Great Exhibition in 1851, entry is free to
all Imperial College students, and the collection
includes an amazing number of world firsts.
Some cool finds: the Apollo 10 command mod-
ule which orbited the moon in 1969; Britains last
major rocket launcher vehicle; a working Difference
Engine, (basically a mechanical computer),
designed in incredible detail by Charles Babbage,
but not, built until after his death; Amy Johnson's

But it's on the first and third floors that, opera
don codename "green T-shirt" really begins. The
people wearing these offending items of clothing will
try to help you, tell you die answers to the puzzles
and generally try to keep you 'well-informed'. Don't
listen to them! They will infiltrate your mind!
If you decide to chance you luck and step into
the museum, it's a cunning idea to pick just a con
pie of galleries to look at in a visit, since there's far
too much to see in one go. Verdict: go there and
check it out. Especially if you've got time to burn.

Internet Hi
Many see it as a
U t o p i a n vision
of anarchistic society. Others a
vast arena for gameplay and
socialising. Some like the U.S.
government, argue that the
internet offers the perfect cover
for organised crime and espi-
onage - they w a n t to keep in
global control by trying to
make it impossible to encrypt
private data. Others like
Singapore want, to stop
Westernised flet°CUlture ' p o l -

Opposing them are others like
Mitchell Kapor of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, campain-
ing for wide-open access to the
Internet as a democratic right.
VOU d e c i d e H e r e in
the College, we enjoy the best
Internet access there is. Use it.
Get on line! You have the
power to jack in to the

exploding out of the Intenet.
