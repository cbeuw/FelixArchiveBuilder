Saved: the new projector is installed in the now flood-free Da Vinci's
Flood Disaster Averted
BY MIKE INGRAM
Imperial College's compulsive
equestrianites were jumping for
joy last, month with the announce-
ment of a new prize for a
scholarship in horseracing.
To "encourage the growth of
scholarly work on the racing
industry", the British Horseracing
Board announced four prizes for
undergraduates expected to
graduate in 1995.
The prizes include annual
membership (junior membership
if applicable) at the racecourse of
your choice (but not, Wolver-
hampton or Southwell and only
junior membership at York), and
some books.
To qualify, simply send a
typewritten copy of your long
essay or dissertaion on the subject
of the horseracing industry,
together with a letter from your
tutor or Departmental Head
certifying that the paper's topic
has been accepted by the College,
before 30th April 1995 (unless you
make a special case for extending
the deadline).
BY THE NEWS TEAM
In what has been described as a
tremendous feat of organisation,
the damage caused by last
Thursday's flooding of Da Vinci's
Snack Bar was completely
repaired within 24 hours.
Scaffolding with spodights was set
up while all of the ceiling tiles
were being replaced in time for the
beginning of Freshers' Week.
The damage was extensive â€”
carpets may have to be replaced
due to shrinkage. Further disaster
was, however, averted. If the
flooding had happened a day
later, the newly installed big
projection television would have
been caught, in the mess.
More worrying is the lack of
any explanation as to why the new
pipes, installed in the past few
weeks during renovation of the
heating system, should show holes
after extensive high-pressure
testing. The faults were
successfully capped, and the
system now appears to be working
well. Dan Look (Dep. Pres. F&S),
described himself as being devoid
of any sparkling comments, and
said "the, heating engineers were
just, wandering around saying they
didn't know why it had
happened."

Fantastical Party Time
Firstly a plug. Next Monday, at.
6pm, there will be a 'media
party'. This will be a gathering of
those people, interested in the
various forms of magnetic media
available for today's computer
equipment: eg. disk drives and
magnetic tapes. There will be
displays by companies at the
leading edge of media supply plus
a 'hands-on' section for adults
only in the senior common room...
The Real Party
Lies, lies - it's thursday afternoon
and I'm desperate for a joke. The
real 'media party' will be a
gathering of Imperial College's
three student media. It will be on
Monday, in the Union Building
around 6pm. STOIC, IC Radio
and F E L I X will be pushing
their wares in an atmosphere
sweetened with cheese, and wine.
Anyone interested in writing,
filming or spinning disks should
attend, sign up and drink up too...
Making Science Sexy
Whilst I don't, entirely agree with
the message promoted in the 'S-
FILES' I certainly agree with
making students think about
science. So many drift through
college seeing their time here as an
aggregation of exams, course
credits and, possibly, knowledge. I
certainly did. This approach is like
a computer game in its amorality:
Enter through the main gates,
find food and drink and attempt
to get to the next, level by
collecting keys (exams) until the,
end-of-game sequence at. the
Royal Albert Hall. Except it isn't a
game: your science will be used to
create poisonous chemicals and
tools of thought-control as well as
higher crop yields and non-stick
frying pans. A friend argues that,
saying that, a product of science
has no intrinsic moral content, (eg.
a gun is neutral until used for
good or evil) is rubbish: what,
about a flamethrower, with its
indiscriminate range of fire? Is
that 'more' evil? Accepting that
science is not grey and unrelated
to day-to-day life must: also carry
a need to believe that it can no
longer claim 'academic immunity'
from what we term morality.
Belated Thanks
Marcus Alexander and I sent
various felines between London
and Cambridge over the summer,
trying to secure the true likeness of
' F E L I X ' . The final version is
sitting on the cover and I'd like to
thank Marcus for the time and
catfood he spent producing it.
