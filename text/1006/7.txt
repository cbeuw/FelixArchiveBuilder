little or nothing at all a n d then

graduation ceremony. To a certain
extent, this may still be the case at
some establishments, a n d may
have once been the case at certain
others, but this rumour has never
and will never be true of imperial
college. "Why?" you all clamour.
W h y ? W e l l , e s s e n t i a l l y , it is
because imperial is a science col-
lege, this means that most of the
students are male and really quite
dull. Nothing really happens here,
the anorak brigade
- or the Kens - care
for nothing but the
s o u n d of a b a l l
point on clipboard
and of course Star
Trek (the new one
w i t h o u t C a p t a i n
Kirk). T h e r e is a
very large group of
overseas students
who, in their wis-
d o m , t e n d to be
fairly i n s u l a r a n d
stay more or less
w i t h i n t h e i r o w n
groups. There is the
sporty crowd - not
to be mistaken with people that
play sport, by the w a y - w h i c h
tends to occupy the union bar on
Fridays and consists mostly of fat
bearded men or potentially fat
bearded men from the school of
mines, the various drinking clubs
and the ' h a r d ' sports clubs like
Rugby. Here there may also be
found some of the college's female
members, but like the male mem-
bers of this drunken bigoted car-
buncle on society they are pre-
d o m i n a n t l y fat a n d b e a r d e d .
Worse still than the violent and
abusive imperial yobbos seen here
are those of the anorak brigade
who have girded up their loins and
decided to become more than just
mycologists of plasma physicists,
this breed of S u p e r - K e n s have
thrown off their chains and in an
effort to win friends and influence
people (which they see as being
achieved by becoming a fat beard-
ed violent abusive yobbo) they sign
up for rag. Collecting money for
charity is a reasonable past time, I
will not scoff at that, but I for one
was fairly concerned after my one
rag o u t i n g - the T i d d l y w i n k i n g
thing - when the then rag chair
insisted that everyone start chanti-
ng their union song, or whatever it
is. I don't particularly mind chanti-
ng unintelligible crap in public, I
have been known to do just that at
S t a n f o r d B r i d g e of a S a t u r d a y
afternoon. But to do so holding
hands around Eros in some sort of
by
c o o o l . That's coool by imperial
standards at least. This summer I
came into one of the student halls
to collect a friend to go out, and
low and behold I passed through
the threshold of a party where two
ex-union presidents were sitting
around a table smoking. "Do you
cane it man?" was the question,
and it was one that left me cold
because I had no idea what they
were talking about. I realised then
that it had been about five years
since I had any contact with real
drugs pricks, w h o knew a l l the
c o o o l things to say, a n d m o r e
importantly what they meant i.e.
D a b s a n d D o v e s , w h i c h to me
remains totally meaningless. It was
Most people are caught in the imperial sex
trap, which is so weird it is almost
impossible to document
semi-religious solemnity was to me
quite sinister, and I was certain
that fatted cows w e r e about to
meet their bloody end for the ben-
efit of s o m e startled A m e r i c a n
tourists, who at the time were to
astounded to even say "neat" at
anything. Don't be lulled into a
false sense of security by the fact
that the last two rag chairs have
been lesbians either, there is noth-
ing remotely fab or trendy to be
had from rag what so ever.
Now, I have perhaps led you
slightly astray on the sex and drugs
theme by intimating that neither
sex nor drugs are to be found at
i m p e r i a l . Both are present, but
both in a bizarre warped nature
peculiar to this place. Drugs can be
found here, but only if you are
a good summary that these blokes
were probably a little older than
m e , yet I h a d n ' t s a i d a n y t h i n g
remotely as sad as that since the
eighties. The dope kiddies along
with the plastic hippies are the
saddest out of all the imperial sad-
does, because they see themselves
as some sort of subversive under-
ground movement. "Lock the door
man". It is a ridiculous rebellion
against some sort of middle class
sense of propriety. Y o u will find
that most of these people are from
quite well-off backgrounds, and
were at home in Surrey reading
Enid Blighton books during the '88
acid revival. Whereas I being the
macho and heroic type (I mean
wistful and enigmatic of course)

Sexual d e s p e r a t i o n a m o n g
u n d e r g r a d u a t e s leads to a very
strange form of positive assort-
ment. This is to be observed mostly
in public places like the jcr, where
the world's ugliest couples can be
seen snogging each other, and fir-
ing those "I am in an exclusive sex-
ual relationship and you aren't"
glances around the room at people
without some fifteen stone beard-
ed heifer draped all over them.
M o s t p e o p l e are involved else-
where, or are caught in the imperi-
al sex trap, which is so weird it is
almost impossible to document.
The rules are, you cannot go out
with a n y o n e as your mates will
take the piss out of you so much as
to be not w o r t h
the pros of the
whole thing. This
is of course applic-
able to both sexes.
Those people that
fear e m b a r r a s s -
m e n t i.e. e v e r y -
one, cannot break
their c o o l u n d e r
any circumstances
a n d get involved
with someone on
their course, or in
their hall, or in the
s a m e g r o u p of
friends, as to do
so w o u l d be
unbearably embarrassing in front
of y o u r f r i e n d s . P r o s p e c t i v e
girl/boyfriends are either or both
of two things, rough and/or sad.
Of course if your fear of falling into
the piss take zone is greater than
your sex drive, you can survive.
Although after a while people start
asking you if you are gay, which
always presents a great opportuni-
ty to play with people's minds, an
often under-appreciated art form.
It seems that there is only one way
to beat the system, and that is to
go out with someone from... the
o u t s i d e w o r l d . If y o u try this
method, remember not to tell the
owner of the required complemen-
tary organ that you are from impe-
rial, as it is f a m o u s for its sad
bastards.
