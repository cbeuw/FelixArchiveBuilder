in association with Sports Partnership
of both matches with a win by 8 hits
this time compared to a loss of 4 on
the previous occasion we had beaten
Oxford and despite losing to Cam-
bridge by 10 hits on this occasion we
had previously beaten them by 11 so
with only 1 hit in it we had taken 1st
place. Cambridge were unfortunate
to also have lost to Oxford by only
1 hit giving Oxford 2nd place and
Cambridge 3rd.
It was an extremely close season
but to have won the premiership in
only our first year is fantastic, we
are now through to the last 16 of the
championship with our first knock
out match in only 2 weeks against
Kent.
News in brief
Ladies fencing wins
championship
Imperial Team of the Week
ICSM Netball Women’s 2nd
This week the first medicals team have been chosen as Imperials Team of the
Week. The netball 2nds have had a great season winning 7 of their 9 games so
far, and are justly the highest ranking medicals team in the league table. Let’s
hope the girls go from strength to strength.
The Women’s fencing team had their
second premiership tournament in
Bath this weekend. After narrowly
losing to Oxford in the first tourna-
ment to put us in 2nd place in the
league, we went to this weekend
knowing a win against Oxford could
still give us a chance at 1st place.
After a long weekend of matches
Cambridge proved victorious on
this occasion, but with an easy vic-
tory over Bath and a couple of close
fought wins over Oxford and Bristol
we were again in 2nd place.
Combined with the previous re-
sults this meant there was a tie on
points between us, Oxford and Cam-
bridge. Taking the aggregate results

The BUSA individual championships
will be in a couple of weeks. We hoped
our final league clash of the season with
Brighton University would end our de-
but league campaign with a flourish
and boost our confidence.
Unfortunately Nan Luan injured her
back the previous week and could not
play. However Christina Vajdi stepped
in as a worthy substitute playing in her
first match of the season.
The opposing team were Kathryn
Butler and Sarah Hubbard who is my
Kent team mate in the County Cham-
pionships. First I comfortably beat Ka-
thryn 11-3, 11-4, 11-4. Then Christina
took on Sarah. Christina took time to
settle into her first match and Sarah
quickly took the initiative by taking
the first game 11-7. However Christina
soon found her form and used her ex-
perience to win the next three games
11-4, 11-8, 11-3 and claim a 2-0 lead
for Imperial. Christina then beat Ka-
thryn comfortably 11-5, 11-2, 11-4 to
seal a 3-0 lead. Finally I played Sarah
who seemed prepared as she raced to a
4-0 lead in the first game but I held my
nerve to come back and take the first
game 14-12. But Sarah took an 8-5 lead
in the second game but again I played
better under pressure and took the
second game 11-9. With greater confi-
dence I claimed the third game 11-3 to
confirm the win for our team.
It has been a strong debut season
for the Imperial ladies as we recorded
wins over Essex, King’s and Brighton
to finish 3rd in the South East division
behind Middlesex who have former
IC just miss out on finals

Lithuanian International Egle Adome-
lyte and London Metropolitan - who
have Chinese International players
including former World no.7 Fei Ming
Tong – and I’m sure will win the team
event.
Unfortunately we needed to finish in
the top two to qualify for the quarter-
finals. Still it is a great achievement
as we are in the strongest division in
the country. Yet the South West divi-
sion only have 2 teams in total who
automatically qualify for the quarter-
finals, now where is the fairness in
that! Hopefully a team will pull out so
we can qualify!
Finally I would like to thank Nan and
Christina for contributing to a great
season for our team. Lets hope we can
improve next year. In the meantime,
I look forward to participating in the
BUSA championships with my fellow
club members this month and hope
we can bring more medals back to
Imperial!
