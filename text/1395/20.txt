D
oes the monotony of
your degree sometimes
get you down? Do you
no longer appreciate the
subtleties of your lecture
notes? Did you ever? Do you find your-
self sitting in lectures, thinking there
must be more to life than this? Even at
Imperial, we’re not machines. We need
to feel alive.
If this is how you feel, then I have
the perfect solution for you. It doesn’t
involve any jet-setting, health spas or
religious conversions. In fact, all you
have to do is come to college one day
during the week from the 11th to the
15th of February. That week is Arts-
Fest on campus, there will be some
artistic pursuit every lunchtime and
every evening – goings-on that
has absolutely nothing to do with
science, technology or medicine.
ArtsFest will feature the Impe-
rial students showcasing their artistic
talents around college, either busking
every lunchtime or performing
during the evening at one of
the nightly events. Appar-
ently, it is possible to be
artistic and have an apti-
tude for science.
The events aren’t
strictly for those
with a classical
frame of mind.
In fact only one
of the events
will be entirely
classical mu-
sic. The rest
is a delight-
ful melange
of jazz, dance,
alternative mu-
sic, visual arts,
theatre, musicals,
close harmony sing-
ing, gospel singing,
literature in Felix, barn
dancing and everything else you
could possibly think of. You did read
that correctly – a large cohort of
Imperial’s students enjoy barn
dancing as much as sex.
We kick off on Monday
the 11th of February at
7:00 pm when the SCR
will be transformed into
a Smooth Jazz Lounge
for the evening. There will
be wine and cheese, as
well as close harmony
singing. Once you are
suitably chilled out, after much
uber-cool dancing, there will be a barn
dance for you to attend.
On Tuesday we have a change of pace,
with an intimate chamber concert in
the Read theatre (Sherfield building
level 5 – on the right) followed by the
opening of an exhibition by Leosoc in
the Blythe gallery. These both promise
to be laid-back, chilled-out events. A
perfect way to recover from Monday.
Wednesday sees the return of the
charity concert from previous years.
This year we’re supporting Theatre
Crossroads: an educational charity
developing inspirational programmes
identifying the basic concepts in Sci-
ence and Maths and teaching them
through music, games, movement and
drama. The concert will be in the Tan-
aka building from 12:30 until approxi-
mately 1:30. There will seats so you
can appreciate both the lilting string
sounds of Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra and the voices of IC Choir.
On Wednesday we don’t finish there
and we have an afternoon of interactive
arts for you to sample and enjoy. From
belly dancing to theatre, there’ll be a
workshop waiting for you Wednes-
day afternoon. You can put off that
problem sheet for a few hours, and do
something that’s actually fun instead.
Thursday sees a light lunchtime con-
cert from one of Imperial’s premiere
ensembles – ICSE (String Ensemble).
The concert is again in the Tanaka,
which will be filled with Avro Part and
Janacek. There is also the possibility
of some Mendelssohn. The evening
features IC Big Band crooning for Val-
entine’s day in the Union as well. Re-
quests are already being taken, and
what better way is there of com-
memorating your love. Of course
your beau wishes to be sung
about.
Finally, the Finale Con-
cert on Friday is the cul-
mination of the week.
Here we showcase the
very best of the acts that
busked during the week
(and many that didn’t).
This is of course un-
missable, not
only as it is
the per-
fect end to
a week –
even if you
did nothing
else, this
would wipe
away any
Friday blues
youhave.Also,
this is one of
the highlights
of the calendar
at Imperial,
being more
exciting than
a guest lecture
by the head of
CERN. In
fact, Buddha
said in the
Abhutadhar-
ma that you cannot
achieve karmic enlighten-
ment unless you attended
the Artsfest Finale Concert.
Naturally, after this mas-
sive concert we have an even
more massive (MASSIVE) par-
ty in the Union to commemorate the
event of finishing Artsfest for another
year. During this party we drink in sad-
ness that we may participate in Arts-
fest but once a year. The tickets from
the Finale Concert will let you into the
Union for free, which should be incen-
tive enough to come along to the gig
earlier.
Of course, Artsfest would be noth-
ing without a captive audience for the
week – which is where you come in.
Artsfest will be a success this year but
we need the support of the Imperial
public. Cast off your shy personality,
give up problem sheets for a week and
let all the other things that make you
human take over. If only for a week.
