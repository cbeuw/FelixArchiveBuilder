Hello everyone. As you will probably have
noticed election season is now upon us
where you get the opportunity to see
who gets my job (and with it the privilege
of making regular contributions to this
esteemed publication) next year. A lot of this
column does focus on our democracy which
judging by the number of candidates standing
for election is pretty vibrant. First of all I will
point you in the direction of some Trusts
that might be able to help out your Club or
Society with some extra money which I am
sure everyone agrees is a good thing.
Harlington/IC Trusts
The Harlington Trust was established in
1989 to manage money received from the
gravel extraction operation at the Harlington
playing fields, for the benefit of Imperial
College students . The Harlington Grants
Fund Committee (a past Union President,
the Pro-Rector (Education) and I) oversee
the allocation of grants on behalf of the
Trust. The Committee still has quite a lot
of money to allocate this year so if you
are involved with the running of a Club or
Society who are in need of extra funds for
something within the aims and objects of the
Trust I would encourage you to apply. More
information about the Trust, specifically what
sort of things it supports and how to apply
is available on the College website at http://
www3.imperial.ac.uk/secretariat/governance/
committees/harlingtongrantsfundcommittee.
In addition, the next meeting of the IC
Trust takes place on 11th March and in a
similar manner I encourage you to consider
Presidentâ€™s Update
Tickets available online from imperialcollegeunion.org.
