Logic Puzzle: Staying In
Using the clues and logical deduction
alone, work out how all the people
involved in the match relate to each
other. The puzzle can be solved with-
out guesswork. Make use of the grid to
mark the combinations that you know.
Read through each clue and make any
obvious or stated deductions. Find the
corresponding row and column on the
grid and place a tick for ‘Yes’ in the box,
and a cross for ‘No’ in the cells next to
this one vertically and horizontally.
Five Imperial males decided to have
a night alone with a take-away and a
porn video to keep them warm in the
cold, cold night. Can you discover the
title of the film watched by each per-
son, together with the meal each or-
dered and the name of the lead actress
in the flick?
1. Ashley watched Deep Throat, enjoy-
ing it’s artistic merit (of course). The
person who watched Shaving Ryan’s
Privates wasnt watching Stormy Bot-
toms, who had a very ample backside.

2. The person who enjoyed Free Willy
(not the Warner Bros. version) had an
Indian included a madras. Both were
hot!
3. Phil watched his favourite actress
named Slutty McTrampster. The film
he watched wasn’t Chitty Shitty Gang
Bang or Shaving Ryan’s Privates.
4. Busty de Lusty (who was rather well
endowed) was watched by the person
who tucked into a generous portion of
fish and chips.
5. The person who ate pizza wasn’t
Christian, who watched Wendy Whop-
pers and her enormous assets, which
he thought jiggled rather nicely.
6. Whoever watched Good Will
Humping saw the actress Ivanna Fook,
who gave a very realistic and gritty
performance.
7. John (who didn’t watch Ivanna Fook)
enjoyed his Chinese meal, enjoying the
view enormously (dirty boy).

testado a mis textos a Felix. Soy
completamente inconsolable. He
vertido mi corazón hacia fuera en
mis pequeños mensajes, y usted in-
cluso no ha contestado. Mis dolores

los dedos del pie, tan lentamente.
Conteste por favor por favor por
favor. Espero en esperanza.
