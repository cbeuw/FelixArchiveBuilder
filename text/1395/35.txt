Virgo
This week you
suffer from inverted
vertigo. Standing
in a flat, open
field causes you to
tremble like a baby
within grasping distance of a paedophile so
you seek the nearest high point possible to
cure your anxiety, which just happens to be
the Eiffel Tower in France. Run with me on
this one, everyone knows there are loads of
fields around the Eiffel Tower.
Scorpio
People flock to
see you atop your
Tower, but it all
becomes far too
overwhelming. You
cut the lift cables
sending it crashing to the surface of France,
killing seven people in the process. Somehow,
and God only knows, you construct the
world’s largest fireman’s pole so that people
can’t climb up it, but you can climb down
when you feel like it.
Libra
At the top of the
Eiffel Tower you can
see for miles in all
directions, including
down below. The
thought of being
dead within seconds as a result of throwing
yourself over the balcony pleases you greatly.
As much as the urge to top yourself takes a
hold of you, you resist and become the world’s
Most Vertical Squatter.
Sagittarius
Rather stupidly –
you twunt – once
you slide to the
realm of pedestrians
for the first time,
you realise you can’t
get back up your pole. You scale the stairs
which, up until this point, no-one else had
thought about using either. The pedestrians
cotton on to this mistake in your plans and
begin to charge up the staircase. You prepare
for Operation Swiss Family Robinson.
Capricorn
Armed to the teeth
with M16s and
toxic bird shit you
defend your tower
will all your might.
Somehow you
even manage to get some large tree trunks to
roll down the stairs, just like in Swiss Family
Robinson. However, Godzilla appears and rips
the Eiffel Tower from the ground to use as a
baseball bat in his game with Mothra. You die.
Cancer
What’s happened
to all the fun and
games at Imperial
in recent years?
When was the
last time someone
did anything remotely as cool as sticking
up a picture of Mr T alongside the Blackett
department’s physics greats? Students: you
are implored to lighten-up and make more
practical jokes. FLY MY PRETTIES.
Gemini
I’ve just noticed
a trend emerging
in this week’s
horoscopes... they
seem to be rather
influenced by
television, cinema and the media. Basically,
I’ve got square I eyes is what I’m telling myself.
Yet, I haven’t actually watched television
properly for a good while? Hmm. Puzzling.
Tune in next week to see if Tomo can solve the
mystery behind his affliction!

Whatcha gonna do.
It’s a nice-a poo,
ahh, shuddap-a your
face. Er, Jov, firstly...
YOU CAN’T SAY
THAT and secondly,
the lyrics don’t go like that. Don’t make me
come over there and ram my foot up your ass.
Jeez... *SOLILOQUY* I just cannot believe my
staff sometimes. What is an editor to do if they
fail to grasp the concept of neo-tangentialism
in the work place.

So... Fucking Agony
Aunt bitch-face
whore is back
thinking she’s all
that. Well, here’s

up on the internet if you’re too retarded to
know what it means; Sittingbehindyou: You
suck. Die; RaspberryRipple: Nipple more like;
Scratchy: Keep goin’ till you dig through bone.
Pisces
So, you like French
electro-pop do you?
Well I think you’re
a bastard. You with
your boing-bing...
boing-boing and
all that jazz. What you need is a smattering
of CILLIT BANG. CILLIT BANG and the
FRENCH POP is GONE. HI, I’m BARRY
SCOTT. I’m a SERIAL KILLER in real life
but I make a LIVING conning people into
CLEANING PENNIES with CILLIT BANG.

Needy McNeedy: solving woes since ‘67 in ‘Nam
S
o you think you’ve got
problems? I think you have
too. Get in touch with me at
agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk
and I’ll beat some sense
into you provide you with expertly
patronising advice. Believe me, I’ve
got lots of experience with having
embarrassing problems.
Dear Needy,
I fancied this guy on my course for
ages. Finally, last week, we started
going out. But, yesterday, I started
coming out in red splotchy patches –
a massive rash. My housemates say
I’m allergic to commitment, but I do
Biology and don’t think that’s actually
possible. I asked my lecturer but he
looked at me funnily. What can I do?
Embarrassed
Dear Embarrassed,
You have an STI. Go to a doctor.
P.S. The rash is on my arms and legs,
not my dinkle warmer.
Oh. By far the most likely explanation
is that you’re allergic to the 20mg Gin-
seng tablets he takes to keep his hair
glossy. If he hasn’t told you about this,
don’t ask, it’ll only embarrass him. I
suggest fake tan to hide the red patch-
es, although don’t take medical advice
from me as I’ve been known to pick my
scabs and pour lemon on paper cuts.
Work through the pain, sister.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy,
I think I’ve fallen in love with my
lecturer. It’s the way she wears un-
ironed shirts and thick glasses. People
have noticed me touching myself in
lectures and are starting to avoid me.
What can I do?
Mr. I’msittingbehindyou
Dear Mr. I’msittingbehindyou,
You clearly hate your degree and feel
trapped by Imperial, thus your affecta-
tion for your lecturer is, in fact, a mani-
festation of Stockholm Syndrome. The
hatred is, perhaps, a normal reaction
and nothing is to be done about it. Per-
haps you should buy a baggy sweatshirt
to hide your stimulation, and always
remember to wash your hands.
I would also suggest joining some
kind of society to liberate yourself from
the confines of your degree but a) I’m
not sure what society would be appro-
priate and b) I don’t want to foist you
on some other unsuspecting students.

Dear Needy,
My new boyfriend has started going to
Atomic Kitten reformation gigs with
his bisexual housemate. He assures me
he doesn’t swing that way but I can’t
help but wonder…
RaspberryRipple
Dear RaspberryRipple,
It’s not surprising you’re concerned. I
strongly urge you to consider dumping
him; otherwise the strains of “Whole
Again” may haunt you for the rest of
your life. Think strongly about how
much you want to be with a man who
has seen Atomic Kitten live, which
might make the split easier if you are
one of those calm people who just get
mildly irritated by crap music rather
than somebody who hears a single
note and starts polishing their knuckle
dusters.

Dear Needy,
I think I’ve got fleas. Every morning I
wake up with huge bites all over me,
and now the people on my corridor
are complaining that it’s happening to
them too. How can I get rid of them?
Scratchy&Co
Dear Scratchy&Co,
Ever heard the old atdage: there’s no
fleas without a cat? You’ve got bed-
bugs, which is far worse. Interestingly,
bedbugs are so repulsive that at one
point in their evolution, the females
all decided (en mass) “Nuhuh, I ain’t
touchin’ that no more,” and so the males
decided (en mass) that rape was the
only way forward (or the more techni-
cal term: artificial insemination). Get
fumigated, and in the meantime, apply
Deathlac (available from your nearest
chemist) liberally to your bed, pillows
and friends.
