GSA election results: zero
to two postgraduate heroes?
Tom Roberts
Editor-in-Chief
GSA Chair and Treasurers successfully elected but nominees
running for Secretary positions withdrew from election
On Wednesday, the Union announced
the results of the most recent Graduate
Students Association (GSA) election.
Kilian Frensch became the new GSA
Chair and Yinka Bisiriyu is the latest
GSA Treasurer. However the GSA Sec-
retary post remains unfilled after both
candidates withdrew midway through
the election.
The GSA represents postgraduates
at Imperial including PhD and Masters
students, by voicing their concerns
and needs to the Union, the College
and nationally. However, the associa-
tion has been non-existant since No-
vember when the previous Chair, Jon
Matthews, resigned in dramatic fash-
ion after Union Council rejected two
of his reports deeming his work over
the summer break unsatisfactory. His
resignation left the GSA committee
without any members. Postgraduate
representation suffered further still last
term without a permanent Postgradu-
ate Co-ordinator staff member present
within the Union.
Mr Frensch was the sole nominee in
the race for GSA Chair beating RON
(re-open nominations) 111 votes to
19. The contest for Treasurer was very
closely contested, however, with four
votes separating Ms Bisiriyu and her
closest rival.
Turnout has increased slightly since
the last election, going from 111 to 130
votes in the GSA Chair election com-
pared to the last election. 211 votes
were cast in the Treasurer election
but with over 4,500 postgraduates at
Imperial College the overall turnout
remains very poor with less than 5% of
the electorate voting.
Hopefully, if Mr Frensch’s ambitious
manifesto is anything to go by, the
GSA will bring some tangible change
for postgraduate students. In it, he says
he wants to “gain ‘student status’ for
writing-up students” in order to waive
council tax and to allow them to use
College’s facilities, since PhD students
in their fourth year lose swipe card ac-
cess. He also states that he will cam-
paign to “allow research students to
keep income from scholarships that ex-
ceed standard paying rate” and to “re-
gain pay taken from Mathematics PhD
students when they were underpaid.”
Unlike his predecessor, Mr Frensch
will have a Treasurer for support and
with the recent appointment of a per-
manent Union Postgraduate Co-ordi-
nator the GSA appears to be getting
back on track. The Union President,
Stephen Brown, told Felix that now
the GSA has a core team from which
it can build on, it will be left to its own
devices and to find itself a Secretary to
complete the GSA trinity.
If Mr Frensch achieves everything
he set out to do, he will be one of the
greatest student representatives ever.
Even if he brings only his first promise
to fruition he will have resuscitated the
GSA, which has been flat-lining for a
while. Defibrillate away Kilian!

IC Canoe Club in minibus
crash with Mercedes-Benz
At midnight, on their way back from a recent weekend trip to the
Lake District, the minibus driven by IC Canoe Club was struck in
the rear by a Mercedes-Benz. A female passenger in the Mercedes-
Benz was taken to hospital as a result of the accident, however
no one else was injured. The Union’s legion of minibuses will be
depleted for at least two months due to the extent of the damage;
the chassis could be written-off due to the incident.
