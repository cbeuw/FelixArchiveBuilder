Presidential election Primaries
and Caucuses are basically two
different methods of accom-
plishing the same thing. They
are, simply, a way in which
each political party (Democrat-
ic and Republican) lets voters
around the U.S. choose their
party’s presidential candidate.
More technically, presidential
primaries and caucuses are the
way that delegates or repre-
sentatives from each state, are
selected to go to the party’s
national convention.
The party’s national conven-
tion is usually held the sum-
mer before the presidential
election. Each party chooses a
presidential nominee based on
how representatives from each
state vote at the convention.
Both parties select their dele-
gates based on the primary or
caucuses vote in each particu-
lar state – the delegates repre-
sent the views of the voters in
the state.
At the Republican party con-
vention, a winner takes all sys-
tem is used. The candidate with
the most votes in a states cau-
cus or primary wins all the del-
egates that the state sends to
the national convention. How-
ever at the democratic conven-
tion, a different system is used.
The number of delegates each
candidate receives is propor-
tional to the number of votes
received in each state primary
or caucus. The number of del-
egates that each state can send
to the national convention is
determined by party rules. the
state’s population, number of
elected officials in office and
past support of party candi-
dates is considered to decide
the number of delegates.
How does it
all work?
A
fter Super Tuesday, John
McCain has cemented
his position as front-run-
ner for the Republican
nomination. However
the race is not over, with Mike Hucka-
bee’s surprise performance turning it
into a 3-horse contest.
John McCain won the big states,
New York and California, as well as 7
other states giving him a total win of
511 delegates. His performance posi-
tions him as the front-runner but cer-
tainly has not ended the race. There
were mixed feelings at the McCain
camp after the victory. While he told
the crowd “Tonight, I think we must
get used to the idea, that we are the
Republican Party front-runner”, he was
also cautious, speaking in terms of a
“long way ahead”. Mr McCain has good
reason to be cautious, he is still treated
with suspicion by Republican conserv-
atives who believe him to be soft on the
Democrats and somewhat of a maver-
ick. Super Tuesday has shown us that
Republican conservatives are still not
willing to embrace McCain, preferring
Romney and Huckabee.
Mitt Romney certainly had a bad
night on Tuesday. He is significantly
behind John McCain in terms of dele-
gates. He won 7 states but only accrued
176 delegates as a result. The McCain
campaign team has certainly tried to
portray Romney as out of the race, by
releasing a memo penned by McCain
strategist Charlie Black. “With Mike
Huckabee still a factor in this race,
particularly in the South, and many
contests moving forward proportional,
the math is nearly impossible for Mitt
Romney to win the nomination,” he
wrote.
Mike Huckabee is a thorn in the side
for the Romney campaign. By directly
competing with Romney for conserva-
tive support, Huckabee has split the
Republican conservative vote and giv-
en McCain an opportunity to extend
his lead. it is becoming very likely that
Huckabee is staying in the race, pre-
cisely to prevent Romney from winning
the race. While Huckabee and McCain
do not agree on all of their policy, they
do share a dislike of Mitt Romney
T
he race to secure the
democratic nomination
remains neck and neck
after a largely inconclu-
sive Super Tuesday for
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
Their wins are largely balanced and it
doesn’t seem too unbelievable to sug-
gest that the nomination might still be
contested at the Democratic National
Convention.
Hillary Clinton won 8 states, 5 less
than Barack Obama. However included
in these states were the big prizes such
as California and New York. There-
fore the number of delegates that she
won was 582, 20 more than Obama.
The Clinton Camp was extremely op-
timistic after Tuesday’s result. Clinton
campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway
had this to say, “The voters defied the
pundits’ expectations again, we’re ex-
cited about beating the perceived mo-
mentum that Obama had,” With Clin-
ton still garnering support from female
voters she certainly has cause for cel-
ebration. The night did throw up some
cause for concern, the Clinton camp
was focused on winning the big states,
ignoring the many smaller states that
went to Obama. In addition, Obama
did welll even in the states he lost, and
in the democratic system where every
vote counts this could prove to be im-
portant as the campaign continues.
The Obama campaign had a mixed
night. While there is certainly no
grounds to suggest that he isn’t a seri-
ous contender, there is the feeling that
Obama’s supporters were hoping for a
knockout blow that would push them
firmly into the lead. Instead the ‘cam-
paign for change’ has really bought
more time in a race that seems to favour
Hillary the longer it goes on. There is
some concern that despite the momen-
tum Senator Obama had built up in the
previous week, he was unable to turn it
into a decisive victory. However this is
unlikely to dampen optimism amongst
Obama’s campaigners and with reports
that he raised more than $1m a day in
one recent month Barack Obama is
definitely still in the race, and there is
no indication that a clear winner is go-
ing to appear any time soon.
