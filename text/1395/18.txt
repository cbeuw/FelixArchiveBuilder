Student Art In Focus – Aspirin Art
SAIF makes a triumphant return with a piece of original art from an Anonymous Narcotic User
T
his work of art, if it can be
called that, seems to me a
direct copy of the work of
Fred Tomaselli’s work Pill
Wheels, albeit with more
colour and on a smaller scale. The art-
ist uses a selection of medication (natu-
ral remedies, ibuprofen, Codis, Kalms,
Tyrozettes etc) to create a pattern on a
brightly coloured background.
The artist, materials and title encom-
pass the three main types of chemical
available: illegal, prescription and over
the counter. However, what immedi-
ately springs to mind upon behold-
ing the piece are the vivd colours and
swirls, reminiscent of psychedelics and
an age already passed.
The work also addresses the issue of
societies addiction to chemicals in all
its guises: caffeine, nicotine, painkill-
ers, anti depressants. The song also
being to mind the lyrics of my band’s
song “Quixotelixir”: “A dedicated mind
in a medicated state is a highly over-
rated fate.”
SAIF is analysed this week by
lead singer of Red Hot Chili Pep-
pers, Anthony Kiedis. A recovered
heroin addict, Kiedis now spends
his time sipping herbal tea and
reading the Telegraph. He is also
working on his Doctorate in parti-
cle Physics.

Tomaselli, the inspiraion behind this week’s piece
Musical Theatre Weekly –
Jesus Christ Superstar
History
J
CS was Andrew Lloyd Web-
ber’s second big hit after
Joseph, it premiered in 1970.
The show went to Broadway
for a couple of years, but it
seemed that Americans had a slight
aversion to musicals about religion.
The original film was made in
1973 starring Ted Neeley as Jesus
… No, you won’t have heard of him.
The film was very 70’esque; every-
one wore flares and did the Funky
Chicken.
The film could have made a big
statement about the role of the me-
dia in religion and persecution with
the final song “Superstar”. Instead it
finished with a load of tourists get-
ting off a bus and partying in the
desert.
Come 2001, Lord Lloyd Webber
suddenly realises he’s not making
enough money anymore and that
children in RE classes have discov-
ered that not everyone in the bible
has an Afro.
So he commissions a new version.
This version was supposedly edgier
than the original i.e. combat trou-
sers were put in strategic places. It
basically followed the pattern of the
original version: went to Broadway,
won some Tony Awards and was put
on film.
You probably saw the newer film
in RE when you were 13. It’s the one
where everyone overacts like hell and
Rik Mayall does a little tap dance. I
prefer this version as it’s a bit less “An-
drew Lloyd Webber eighties synthe-
siser” and a bit more “real instruments
like guitars”.
Main Characters:
Jesus: People-loving hippy whose go-
ing to be dead before the end of the
show
Judas Iscariot: Cynical ex-best friend
of Jesus. Similar to House only more
“giving your friend to the authorities to
die”-like.
Mary Magdalene: Jesus’ prostitute
girlfriend
Pontius Pilate: Guy who doesn’t like Je-
sus much but doesn’t want to kill him.
Herod: He hates Jesus even more than
Pontius but does love cheesy dance
routines.
Simon Zealotes: A guy whose meant
to be a fisherman but instead loves
guns. And Jesus.
Plot
Erm, the Bible…For all you Athe-
ists out there, Jesus Christ Superstar
follows the last six days of the Lord’s
life from the point of view of Judas Is-
cariot. Judas is Jesus’ oldest friend but
it is revealed at the beginning of the
second act at The Last Supper that he
will betray him. The story then trails
the arrest of Jesus in the Garden of
Gethsemane and his persecution by
the Romans eventually leading to his
crucifixion via Judas’ suicide and a few
funky dance routines.
Now, you can’t tell me I’ve ruined the
story for you - it’s practically the oldest
story known.
Songs to look out for:
Heaven on Their Minds: Has a great
recurring bass guitar riff and some real
anger. Grr!
I Don’t Know How To Love Him: One
to belt out when the flatmates aren’t
around.
Gethsemane: Fucking amazing, in-
credibly long and very difficult to sing.
If you liked this, try:
The Rocky Horror Show: Ok, so it
has nothing to do with Jesus, but was
commissioned following the success of
JCS and it rocks!
Godspell: This came out around the
same time as JCS. It is again about
Jesus and Judas and is by the guy
who wrote Wicked. Plus any man
who can make a song using just 7
words is on to something!
by Lucy Harrold
Jesus got papped. JCS’s main theme is the influence of the media
on religion and persectution. Not bad for Andrew Lloyd Webber
