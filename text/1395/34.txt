The MS Surface surfaces
James Finnerty explains the talk about Microsoft’s overlooked product
M
icrosoft first an-
nounced their “Sur-
face” product around
a year ago. To give
you an idea of exactly
what it offers it combines a set of ex-
isting technologies to vastly improve
customer experience in a broad range
of locations.
In essence it is a a touchscreen com-
puter that is embedded in the surface
of the table. This alone is nothing new
but the features which have been at-
tached to this interface are what re-
ally makes it shine. Using RFID ( Radio
Frequency Identification ) the surface
can detect devices which have been
laid on it such as cameras, phones and
even credit cards.
A good example of the final use of
the system which has been demon-
strated by Microsoft is a new way to
pay for meals or drinks in a restau-
rant. Say at the end of a meal with a
group of friends you normally have the
tricky process of splitting the bill be-
tween you, with Surface this problem
is eradicated. All of you put your RFID
enabled credit/debit cards on the sur-
face and the waiter can make the bill
pop up on the display. Each member
of the party can then simply drag the
items they purchased from the bill to
their card and they are then charged
appropriately.
A new and interesting development
to the Surface family is the confirma-
tion that a version designed specifically
for home is in the works. Some uses for
this are fantastic. As you may or may
not know the Microsoft Zune allows
people to share music between their
Zunes for free but the tracks delete
themselves after 28 days. This proc-
ess of sharing is not always a very user
friendly experience and once again the
Surface comes to the rescue. With your
Surface in your living room you and
your accomplice can place your Zune's
on the device and then drag files back
and forth.
I think that if this product becomes
mainstream in public places it could be
a big breakthrough. This level of user
experience has always been Apple's
thing and realistic competition in this
market could be fantastic for us as end
users. So Microsoft may start to make
our lives easier for once.
Aww look at that, social computing. Why must companies fill their ads with lies
You must by sick of seeing this thing by now
W
hen my Creative
Zen, a trusty MP3
player that sur-
vived more than its
fair share of abuse,
died I decided to move up in the
world. £256 later i have my replace-
ment, a shiny new 16GB iPod Touch,
but is it worth the money?
After getting over the fact that i now
own an Apple product I have to admit
that I have fallen in love with the sleek
design on the iTouch. Measuring 110
x 61.8 x 8 mm it's a thin and portable
device powered by a 412 Mhz ARM
processor and a large 128MB of RAM.
It comes with the standard iPod grime-
attracting metalic back and a flat glass
front comprised of a 3.5” screen and a
single home button. Fitting perfectly
in the palm of your hand and weigh-
ing a tiny 120g it's a highly “ooh, shiny”
device.
It would be easy to go on about the
design of the iTouch, however there is
so much more to this device, namely
the interface. The iTouch uses a multi-
touch sensitive glass screen atop a gor-
geous 480x320 display. With vibrant
colours and a high number of pixels per
inch (163 dpi) it's incredibly sharp and
clear. The device is perfect for video
podcasting, able to show widescreen
footage without a hitch. Unfortunately
you are limited to Apple's favourite for-
mats (MPEG, h.264, Quicktime Mov),
so no native DivX support.
Apple have clearly spent a large
amount of research on the iTouch as
the navigation is seamless and intuitive
with out-of-the-box usability. The mu-
sic library is fast and simple to navigate,
with the optional glitsy iTunes-style
coverflow, utilising the touch screen
to flick through the library in a more
natural manner. Scrolling through
your music library is quick, easy and a
pleasure compared to the Zen's click-
wheel interface.
Now the iTouch is more than an MP4
player due to the cloning of its close
relative, the iPhone. Inheriting WiFi
connectivity, along with the design and
interface, the iTouch is an amazingly
powerful portable internet device. The
built in Safari web browser renders
pages with the iTouch's screen size in
mind and the touch screen interface
provides the best web browsing ex-
perience i've used for some time. The
onscreen keyboard is incredibly accu-
rate, with dictionary based corrections
for typos, gestures for zooming and
the ability to correctly identify the link
you're attempting to click. However,
without the iPhone's ability to use the
mobile network, the iTouch is limited
to internet browsing in range of a Wifi
hotspot, although the university wire-
less network is a perfect substitute.
The iTouch packs one last punch in
its inventory to make it a highly ad-
vanced portable media device, appli-
cations. The current version in stores
(1.1.3) comes pre-loaded with Google
Maps, Mail, Youtube, stocks, as well as
having an entire online web application
site. These extend the iTouch's func-
tionality far beyond anything currently
competing on the market and with the
release of the SDK around the corner
(allowing home programmers to create
their own applications) the iTouch has
limitless potential.
A hefty pricetag does detract from
the iTouch's appeal, although there is
an 8GB version for £199 and a 32GB
version announced on Monday for
those that have a huge media collec-
tion. The functionality of this device
keeps giving, yet it is limited when
not within range of a wireless access
point. The iTouch is perfect within the
University's free wireless network, al-
though i would recommend potential
buyers to weigh up whether they will
be using everything the iTouch has to
offer.
