Weighing up the cost of fair trade
E
veryone who digs deep
enough in Felix every week
to get as far as this page
probably also noticed that
Imperial has recently be-
come a Fairtrade University. Among
other things this has to do with the fact
that every coffee you buy on campus
(as well as every tea and many of the
other treats supplied by College Cater-
ing) is Fairtrade certified. As a member
of Imperial’s Fairtrade Society it sur-
prises me regularly to see how many of
those coffee and tea drinkers are com-
pletely ignorant about the meaning of
the term Fairtrade. So I was glad to see
that someone has enough interest in
the topic to raise it in the last issue of
Felix where “Matt the Hat” expresses
concerns about how fair Fairtrade is to
the consumer and whether free trade
might be fairer than Fairtrade. These
are two interesting questions but I
think Matt missed a point on both of
them.
Why are Fairtrade things always so
much more expensive than the “nor-
mal” stuff? Well, to start with: They
aren’t. When Imperial’s coffees became
Fairtrade two years ago the price didn’t
rise. And if you go to the supermar-
ket you will notice that sometimes the
Fairtrade coffee is in fact cheaper than
the non-Fairtrade. Admittedly, these
are exceptions.
There are cases where retailers want
to earn from people’s consciousness
about issues such as Fairtrade. For a
cup of cappuccino which I was told
costs more than £2 on the high street,
the farmer sees 1.5p on average. If the
Fairtrade version costs more, this is
for three main reasons: the fraction of
a penny the farmer gets more for his
product, the higher cost of distribut-
ing Fairtrade products because they
still have a smaller market and last, but
definitely not least, the retailer’s greed.
If the latter takes over, even I as a Fair-
trade supporter would advise you to
vote with your feet and walk to a dif-
ferent coffee shop.
Now Matt asks where the free market
isinthiscase.Idon’tknowhowhecould
miss it! Having the choice between two
different products, Fairtrade and non-
Fairtrade, and the choice of where to
buy either, how could the market be
freer and fairer? As opposed to the EU,
Fairtrade does not subsidise produc-
ers. Let me explain this with the exam-
ple of Fairtrade footballs (yes, they do
exist). 90% of the world’s footballs are
produced in Pakistan and while no one
counted it is believed that a good 30%
are produced by child labourers. I have
the option of buying the cheap football
made by a child who will never go to
school and one that is made by an adult
who earns a wage that I would consider
appropriate for making me a football.
And there is the factory owner who has
the choice of employing children and
paying them next to nothing or fulfill-
ing a range of criteria to become Fair-
trade certified. This is the free mar-
ket with two products competing for
demand. Subsidies are nowhere to be
seen in Fairtrade. Just ask yourself: Is
it a subsidy if a Jaguar X-Type is more
expensive than a Ford Mondeo?
Fairtrade should also not be con-
fused with charity. Matt remembers
the principle of “how people prefer
fishing rods over truckloads of fish”.
Giving people the fishing rods is ex-
actly what Fairtrade does. When farm-
ers use the Fairtrade premium they are
paid to make their production organic
so they can sell it for higher prices, the
Fairtrade premium was like a fishing
rod to them.
Matt is right about one thing though:
since Fairtrade relies on the free mar-
ket we need the economy to “tip back
in their favour”. In plain English that
means if we don’t buy Fairtrade foot-
balls no one will produce them any
more. That’s why I think everyone of
us should find out enough about Fair-
trade to make a conscious decision as
to whether to buy Fairtrade footballs or
not. And if you don’t need a football, it
also works with coffee, or tea, or choc-
olate, anything you can dream of!
Having said this I will use the last few
sentences of this letter to shamelessly
plug the current campaign run by Im-
perial’s Fairtrade Society. Because we
want to raise awareness of Fairtrade
we invite everyone to ask their ques-
tion about Fairtrade (critical com-
ments phrased as questions are also
very welcome). I won’t mention all the
cool prizes you can win by taking part
on www.imperialfairtrade.org.uk.
