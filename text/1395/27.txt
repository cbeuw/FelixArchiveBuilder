sty Johnson does either of these two
things. Joke!
I love-love-love Jovovich-Hawk’s col-
lection. Although I’m not quite sure if
it’s the clothes or the crop haired mod-
el Shea Prueger who I have a non-les-
bionic crush on. Although some pieces
are too vintage shop unwearable, it’s
indie-pop deliciousness on the whole.
I have higher hopes for London Fash-
ion Week, despite it having a reputa-
tion in the fashion world as being ir-
relevant in comparison to Paris, Milan,
New York. In my opinion it’s by far the
most exciting and inspiring week of
them all.
Next week: The complete NY Fall ‘08
overview.
T
he Fall 2008 collection has
been, at the time of writ-
ing, mostly uninspiring.
There are a few bright
spots, which especially in
contrast, shine bright enough to burn
you retinas.
The worst offender has been Betsey
Johnson, which looks like an irrelevant
old person trying to keep up to date,
pastiching young exciting designers. It
reminds me of Interview with A Vam-
pire (which I think about too much)
where the old vampires need a ‘com-
panion’ to keep them up to date with
the world, otherwise they lose touch
with society and end up going insane
or committing suicide. I suggest Be-
Kitsune Maison 5
The latest cd by music & fash-
ion label Kitsune. The compila-
tion to buy to hear the latest
sounds.

very real way.

A hairdresser is sadly required
to do this. Although I’d go
only by recommendation, you
can’t trust those bastards!
Always with their own agenda.

Ok, so, you’ve got to Imperial, and
found yourself a girlfriend. Most
of the battle is over! Why, then, my
friend, are you reading the fashion
pages of Felix? Because Valentine’s
Day is swiftly approaching, and it
seems you need to purchase said
girlfriend a present.
So, you could go to Sainsbury’s,
and pick her up a handful of swift-
ly rotting carnations to prove your
undying affection. But maybe you
want something a little less... ge-
neric? Here are our top tips for
shopping for your nearest and
dearest female:
1. Don’t buy jewellery from Argos.
Simple; if you like her skin flesh
coloured and not a) rotting with
Excema, b) oddly coloured or c)
both of the above, then I suggest
going to an actual jewellers and
not a homeware store masquerad-
ing as one.
2. Avoid Oxford Street. Yes, it
contains the flagship stores. Yes,
there are more things there. Go
somewhere with only one shop
and then you’ll have less choosing
to do (as long as it’s not Argos).
3. Think about what colours she
wears. Do not fool yourself with
the old adage “she must love the
colour pink, being female and all”.
4. Accessories are safer as you
don’t have to know sizes. Ask
yourself the following questions:
does she have her ears pierced?
Does she wear jewellery? Does she
carry all her make up around with
her everyday (thus ruling out all
bags the size of a postage stamp).
5. Get a gift receipt.
Confused? See you hovering

Sainsburys on Feb 14th.
