thermore, whey uniquely contains cer-
tain aminos, which create a very pow-
erful intracellular anti-oxidant called
glutathione.
It is far easier to drink a protein shake
than to buy, prepare, cook and eat
poultry, fish or egg whites, particularly
if you are at work or on the go. We all
know that eating small, frequent meals
is the best way to eat, whether you are
aiming for muscle gain or fat loss, but
for many people, eating this frequently
is virtually impossible.
Other than convenience, protein
supplements offer few advantages over
protein rich foods. Does that mean
you shouldn’t take them? Absolutely
not. There is no doubt that a protein
shake is far better than grabbing a bar
of chocolate or some take-away when
you get the munchies.
They are also useful for those looking
to lose weight, as increased protein in-
take (as long as you reduce your intake
of carbs at the same time) are positive-
ly implicated in weight loss. The key to
using them is to understand what they
can and can’t do for you.
So at the end of the day, I say eat
whole foods as much as possible, but
when your schedule says otherwise
don’t hesitate to grab a prepared pro-
tein supplement. Also, consider shakes
and bars as an alternative snack or meal
replacement to add variety and benefit
to your dietary regime.

Protein powder vs meat

What is the advantage of taking protein
powder? Why can’t I just eat protein in
real food form?
As you probably already know, pro-
teins are made up of amino acids and
these are the building blocks of mus-
cle. For exercise/fitness purposes we
need protein to repair and build mus-
cle tissue. Adding lean sources of pro-
tein into our diet also helps augment
metabolism facilitating fat burning.
The question is whether to use sup-
plements or whole food - which is bet-
ter? As with most topics in fitness and
nutrition, the grey area is always larger
than expected. Everyone is looking for
the easy one word answer, but in reality
it almost never exists.
If you listen to any bodybuilder, or
read any bodybuilding magazines,
protein powders and supplements are
clearly indispensable to anyone who
exercises regularly. So are you miss-
ing out by eating a high protein diet
instead?
Unfortunately, as those magazines
are also loaded with adverts for those
self-same products they are endorsing,
it is safe to assume that they are less
than objective. So what’s the truth?
How do protein powder and protein
supplements in general stack up against
protein rich foods such as meat, beans,
egg whites or dairy? The reality is that
protein powders / supplements will
not build more muscle than chicken
or egg whites or any other whole food
protein - their big advantage is their
convenience.
I have always been an advocate of
consuming whole foods as much as
possible. What I mean by ‘whole foods’
is foods that have not been altered or
broken down from their original, natu-
ral state, or at least as little as possible
(e.g. whole turkey breast vs. packaged
turkey meat slices). Some great whole
food lean protein choices would be:
chicken/turkey breast, egg whites, fish,
cottage cheese, tofu, legumes, extra
lean cuts of beef…etc. That being said,
I have been consuming whey protein
shakes and bars for the last 5 years. Let
me explain - it all comes down to life-
style. The reality is that like most peo-
ple, I have extremely busy days. When
I am seeing clients for 5 to 8 hours in
a row, I don’t have time to slam down
a chicken breast with sweet potatoes
and asparagus (I’m getting hungry just
thinking about it!). So I grab a shake
or a bar, which gives me the right nu-
trients that I need to keep my body in
check. By the way, I give my busy cli-
ents the exact same advice. Most peo-
ple end up skipping meals, which is the
worst thing you can do if you want lose
fat and build lean muscle tissue. Pro-
tein supplements are a “No Excuse” so-
lution for keeping up with your health
plan.
Whey protein is now the most popu-
lar protein supplement, and is touted
for having the highest biological value.
This basically means that it is more
easily broken down by our bodies
than animal or vegetable proteins, and
therefore quickly provides your muscle
cells with the nutrients it needs after
a workout. The reason for this is that
whey protein is higher in essential
amino acids and BCAA (branch-chain
amino acids). It can also be a bet-
ter source of protein for those of you
wanting to lose body fat, because it is
generally lower in fat and carbs then
most whole food counterparts. Fur-

Fit Tip
When choosing a protein powder,
make sure whey Isolate is the first
ingredient over whey concentrate.
Also, make sure the protein has
been processed using low heat, or
a “cold processing” method. Iso-
late is a more pure source of pro-
tein and the low heat processing
will ensure that its high qualities
are sustained.
If you’re still unsure about which
protein products to look out for,
come and speak to one of the En-
ergia team who will be happy to
advise.
