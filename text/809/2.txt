field work
cut
The Geology Department will be
dropping field work during the
holiday periods and reducing
lecture hours from the start of next
term. The department believe that
the number of staff student contact
hours is excessive and all lecture
courses will be cut to accommodate
the changes. Independent Mapping
projects over the Summer holidays
will continue during the second
year.
'In the past we have tended to
over lecture which is bad for staff
and students,' explained Dr Richard
Selley, Head of Department.
The move is part of a general
restructuring within the department
which, amongst other changes led
to the introduction of a group
tutorial system at the start of the
year. The department are also
considering the introduction of a
tfiird year option in Management
Science.
New
offices
A new office block for companies
liaising with Imperial College is
due to be constructed in the space
between the Civil and Electrical
Engineering Departments. The
Office Block, containing twelve
office suites is due for completion
by September 1989. The suites
will be let out on short term leases
to companies who are making use
of Imperial College's research
facilities. The cost of the building
is estimated at a quarter of a
million pounds.
Student
vouchers
The Government is considering
introducing student vouchers as a
means of funding universities,
according to a report in the
Guardian. Under the proposal
Universities would not be funded
directly, but students would be
given a voucher to be spent on a
University of their choice. The
scheme is reported to be receiving;
growing support from academics
and Vice Chancellors.
Death on
the
Thames
The recent ULU Sri Lanka Society
Dinner and Dance was ruined
according to FELIX eye in the sky
reporter, Charles Brereton, when
the boat crashed into a bridge.
The starboard side of the craft was
'completely wrecked' and two
people were injured as the skipper
corrected too late to avoid a
collision.
Panes of glass were ejected and
ICU Deputy President Charles
Brereton told FELIX that 'if it hadn't
been safety glass it could have been
bloody carnage'.
He went on to say 'it ruined our
evening. It could have been death
on the Thames'.
Fisher
gets new
locks
Following two break-ins earlier this
month, the College plans to install
a new lock system in Fisher Hall in
Evelyn Gardens. The existing ten
front door entrances will be reduced
to three. A 'Corley' magnetically
coded key system, similar to that
installed in Montpelier Hall a yeat
ago, will also be fitted to the front
doors.
The current Union and Yale
system will be replaced by an
' E W A ' master key system at a total
cost of around £6000 from the
College residence account.
Managing Surveyor of Residen-
ces, Peter Hallworth, told FELIX
that the external door locks will be
installed by the beginning of nexl
term although the internal locks will
not be replaced until Christmas due
to problems with delivery.
Finance
go-ahead
Estimates from clubs and societies,
approved by Union Finance
Committee for next year will be
fulfilled despite a cut of £4000 by the
College. Chas Brereton told FELIX
that Union Finance Officer, Reggie
Blennerhassett was confident that
the shortfall would be met.
Car park to expand
Construction work to extend the
main College car park by 50 places
has begun on the North East side
of the Queens Tower. The
extension, due for completion by
October is part of a £150,000
scheme to repair Imperial
Road. The extension will
act as an overflow whilst
are made to the rest of
park.

O b i t u a r y
Professor Neil Watson
The untimely death on June 28 of
Neil Watson, Professor of Internal
Combustion Engineering at the
University of London, following a
fall at his home, deprives the
engineering industry of one of its
leading researchers and is an almost
irreplaceable loss to the staff and
students of the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
Born in London in 1944, Neil
Watson was educated at Allen's
School and Queen Mary College.
After a short period in the computer
peripheral manufacturing industry,
Neil joined the staff of Imperial
College in 1971 as a lecturer.
In 1973 he initiated, jointly with
Professor Janota, an industrially
oriented post-experience course on
turbo-charging which attracted
participants from firms in the UK
and continental Europe. At the
suggestion of Dartmouth College,
New Hampshire he repeated the
course at the College and updated
versions, given alternatively in the
UK and USA bacame a regular and
prominent event in the engineering
world. Neil's qualities as a
communicator were soon revealed
and after won for him many awards
in both countries for the excellence
of his lectures and papers; he was
subsequently greatly in demand as
a lecturer and industrial consultant
in the UK, continental Europe, the
USA and Asia.
Despite the time and effort
required by these activities Neil was
a fully committed member of his
department at Imperial College
where he willingly continued to
shoulder heavy teaching and
administrative duties.
Neil's zest for work, his straightfor-
wardness, his readiness to help
others and his complete absence of
egotism were qualities which made
him a colleague who will greatly be
missed. He is survived by his wife
Elaine and two daughters.
