passages from Isaiah. This all
reaches a climax with the
appearance of Jesus Christ in
America after his Resurrection
appearances in Jerusalem.
Apparently then, Christ chose to
recant His words in John 16.10:
'...because I go to the Father and
you will see me no more...,' and to
disprove Mark's words in MK 16.19;
'...the Lord Jesus after He had
spoken to them, was taken up into
heaven, and sat down at the right
hand of God.' Rather, He went to
America and preached over there.
The more improbable the history,
the more attractive it seems to be.
For example, the Jews were
apparently transported to the
Americas in pre-Christian, dish-
shaped submarines, which had the
facility of plugged air holes, to be
unstopped upon surfacing, and
which were lit inside by magically
glowing stones. Miraculously the
vessels reached the other side of the
Atlantic all together and intact, with
the task of establishing a community
then being taken in hand. One
problem with the history, although
carefully mapped out to avoid
inconsistencies, is the glaring
presence of anachronisms, such as
the 'compass' (not invented until
the twelfth century AD) and the
rather too familiar references to the
'horse' (which was not introduced
to America until the Europeans
arrived).
Actually the history is the least
significant pointer to the Book's
validity, for the prophesies and
doctrinal assertions are far more
iUuminating in this respect. Without
being too detailed, it is worthy to
notice that the Book's prophesies
regarding Jesus Christ far outstrip
the accuracy of the Old Testament;
and despite the Mormons' holding
them to be evidence of the Book's
divine origin, it is easier to see this
rather as prophesy in retrospect. For
example, Jesus' mother has her
name prophesied, 'Mary' and her
connubial state 'Virgin'. Neither is
prophesied in the Old Testament,
for although Isaiah 7.14 does forsee

Christ's birth hundreds of years
before the event, the Hebrew may
perhaps better be translated a
'young woman'. ('Behold, a 'young
woman' shall conceive and bear a
son, and shall call his name
Immanual (God is with us).) That
most Christians believe in Mary's
virginity before Christ's birth is not
the issue, since what is being shown
as over-accurate prophesy and a
distinct obsession with making
certain doctrinal points too
-bundantly clear—which leads to
the next consideration.
In light of Smith's disgust at the
Church for its wars over doctrinal
issues, would it not seem only took
likely that 'he' should pack the Book
of Mormon with clear
commandments which once and for
all settle all the arguments? Indeed
we find just this. When viewed in
this manner, the whole book
becomes transparent in a flash, for
it is certain that whole chapters have
been constructed for the sole
purpose of making one or two
assertions, embellished heavily of
course with quasi-historical
padding. Examples include the
arguments over the existence of hell
and the state of the soul at death,
and whereas the Adventist's were
arguing that Scripture may be
interpreted as disclosing the fact of
'soul-extinction' at death and
'annihilation' of the wicked as
opposed to everlasting torment, the
Book of Mormon improves on
God's Biblical revelation by bluntly
affirming eternal torment and the
transitional life of the soul between
death and resurrection. I am not

endeavouring to favour either view
here, but simply illustrating my
point. Another important one (yet
ironical in view of later teaching by
Smith) is Christ's deity. It is
significant to understand that
although His deity is clearly taught
in the Bible, it is never stated bluntly
in a way completely immune to
misinterpretation. But again the
issue is not here, but the fact of
Smith's 'clarifications'. Christ is
frequently and directly called God,
in a way that permits of no personal
discovery, and which rather
obscures the beauty of the Trinity.
And now their weakest area—
Jospeh Smith himself. Regarding
the above, 'Smith's' divinely
infallible translation of the Book of
Mormon clearly affirms the doctrine
of the Trinity (again far more
clinically than the Bible), and yet
Smith is documented as having
preached on the 'plurality of gods',
in utter contradiction to the
Trinitarian position, and today you
will find that the Trinity is not
fashionable for the contemporary
Mormon, for he has been informed
by Smith since the translation of the
infallible Book, that he, and every
other faithful Mormon, shall reach

equality with God the Father at
some future date, and then proceed
to govern his own universe in much
the same way as our God (once
human like us) governs the present
one. This sort of contradiction is far
from unique, and I feel it casts
further doubt on Smith's authorship
of the Book, which is the subject of
the final paragraph. Also Smith's
character is somewhat in doubt.
Apparently, he at one point eloped
with a young lady since her father
would not countenance their
marriage, for the reason that he
knew Smith to have spent much
time engaged in searching for
hidden treasure with the aid of
magic 'peep stones'. Although the
observation will seem immaterial to
the 'materialists', it is worth noting
that the practice of divination is
expressly forbidden in the Bible, and
that this occupation hardly lends
weight to the Mormon's evaluation
of Smith as a seeker after Truth. As
is the case with the Jehova's
Witnesses with regard to the
doubtful character of their founder
Charles Taze Russell (prosecuted for
selling 'miracle wheat' at exorbitant
prices, amongst other things), the
Mormon's are not keen on
discussion of Smith's character, and
seem to know little about him. Any
accusation against him is, of course,
immediately assumed to have been
fabricated and to be Satanically
inspired—which brings me to their
view of the Church.
Perhaps the most offensive fact
about Mormonism, is its total
intolerance for anyone else at all. So
much for Christ's prayer for the
unity of His Church in John 17—the
Mormons clearly state that all other
Christians are of the Devil. Again
this is fundamentally an assertion,
for looking at the general doctrinal
teaching of the Book of Mormon
(supposedly the basis of belief).
There seems to be little difference
between them and evangelists. So
what is the problem? It is the pure
assertion that the Mormon Church
is, without good reason, the Only
Church and so has unique authority
to disciple Christians. Then of
course with the extra teaching, the
doctrines run into clear heresies and
one is left with non-Christian
Organisations with great power
over its members, built on the
foundation of a manifestly spurious
Book, which seems Christian. The
Mormon danger is in shifting
Salvation through Christ onto the
Organisation. (From a Christian
perspective, it might well be
injudicious to suppose that all
Mormons are necessarily not
Christian, for it is surely conceivable,
that some of them do know Christ,
despite the clear fact that
membership of the Organisation is
not conducive to encouraging this
relationship.)
And finally, Smith did not write
the Book. The Mormons claim that
he translated it in a few days, and
that this time constraint and his
semi-illiterate state verify the
miraculous nature of the events.
Again this is odd logic. As you will
remember, Smith had four years of
relative inactivity in which to write
it (or copy it) in his own handwriting
(had that been necessary), and
although theories suggesting Smith
to have possessed a dual personality
(one side dull—the other containing
hidden brilliance) have been
forthcoming, surely the obvious
solution points to his having either
The Jews were

Americas in pre-

persuaded someone to write the
book for him, or to his having been
used by someone else as an unlikely
prophet to astound the credulous.
Whatever, as mentioned previously,
Smith's subsequent teachings are by-
no means always consistent with
the very carefully defined doctrinal
assertions of the Book, and so his
authorship is probably out of the
question. And these later teachings,
it must be recalled are in no way less
authoritative than the Book, even
though they conflict heavily at
times, making the whole
i Organisation a house built on sand.
