number that has ended every

Then it was over for another year.
Most of us wandered back to our
tents humming the last number,
feeling strangely desolate. Such is
the impact and atmosphere
generated by Cropredy.

For those of you with a yen to see
Fairport Convention live they will be
playing two London venus on their
forthcoming winter tour:
Wimbledon Theatre (SW19),
January 8th 1989 and the Dominion
Theatre (Tottenham Ct Rd),
February 17th 1989.
Or alternatively catch up with
them for their warm-up gigs at the
Half Moon in Putney during
December.
'Filarfolket fiddler-
If anyone wants to sample the
folk-rock scene then I would
recommend Fairport's album In Real
Time recorded live at Cropredy in
1987 or Jethro Tull's album Crest of
a Knave featuring Peggy on bass.
Also worth hearing are Sally Barkers
album In the Spotlight, and Jerry
Donahue's Telecasting. Richard
Thompson's albunrASii^^out this

HAWKS
You would think that a film about
terminally ill people would be a
good recipe for a gloomy load of
crap, but, in fact, the brilliant and
often black humour in this film very
adequately counter-balances any
signs of sentimentality that appear.
Bancroft (Timothy Dalton), a
successful, if somewhat horny,
English lawyer and Decker
(Anthony Edwards) find themselves
in the same ward and dying of the
same disease. It is possible to see the
humour in lines such as; "You
wanna pack suicide in if it's just
gonna depress you" when Decker
is contemplating throwing himself
off the top of the hospital building.
The idea of going out with a
'bang' occurs to the two men when
Decker mentions a whorehouse on
five floors "Like a parking garage"
in Amsterdam, and they finally
agree that stealing an ambulance is
actually the most appropriate and
practical way of fulfilling their final
ambition. Although very eager to
get to the attractions of 'Sin City',
they think that their luck is in when
they see two girls next to a broken
down 2CV and decide to stop to
lend a hand believing that the two
females must be French. They are
not French, and on closer inspection
it is doubtful whether one of them
is actually a woman or a giraffe.
Timothy Dalton and Janet McTeer
as the pregnant Hazel, fill the screen
with an almost slap-stick comedy to
make even the most depressed
person feel happy. Go and see this
film and come out of the cinema
with a smile on your face and
possible a tear in your eye (quite a
combination, eh?).

DREAM
DEMON
Dream Demon is a British-made
haunted house thriller in the old
Hammer tradition. Diana (Jemma
Redgrave) is to marry Falklands
hero Oliver (Mark Greenstreet).
Unfortunately, her subconscious
can't quite come to terms with the
idea and it's easy to see why.
Diana's dreams are full of images of
a married life in which one partner
somehow always seems to be
decapitated. Bound to end in tears,
really.
The dreams become worse after
the arrival of the punk-rocking
Jenny (Kathleen Wilhoite) from Los
Angeles (where else?). Adopted as
a child and whisked away to
America, Jenny is trying to trace her
natural parents, whose last known
address is Diana's marital home.
She rescues Diana from the clutches
of the local gutter press (Jimmy Nail
and Tim Spall) who are after
Oliver's 'length', as it were. From
there, it all goes horribly wrong.
Jenny and Diana have the power to
trap people in their dreams and turn
them into hideous parodies of what
looked uncannily like Roy
Hattersley. The dreams become
| more and more horrific until the
I truth of Jenny's past is revealed.
Dream Demon is certainly a very
frightening film, not least because
it marks the screen debut of yet
another Bloody Redgrave. The
disturbing special effects were
produced by Animated Extras of
Aliens and Company of Wolves fame
and the atmosphere is heightened
by some well-freaky music from Bill
Nelson.
If Fatal Attraction made the men
who saw it think twice about having
affairs, Dream Demon should be the
film to make women think twice
about getting married in the first
place.

SHAG
Apparently, Americans have
absolutely no idea that the word
'Shag' has anything to do with sex,
in fact, I often wonder if Americans
have any idea about sex at all and
this film in places, would certainly
serve to confirm my thoughts.
'Shag', according to this film, is
a dance, well a kind of foot shuffle
really, specially designed for the
young middle-class white kids (not
a black face in sight apart from the
the big fat mama cleaner who comes
out with things like; T ain't seen
such hawny white fowks befaw').
Oh well, this dross must appeal to
some people.
