Union
Editorial
The Mormon Church. The centre
pages of this issue contain a
controversial opinion article on
the Mormon Church. I would like
to point out that the article does
not necessarily reflect the views
of FELIX or of the Editor. I have
to say that I visited the Mormon
Church on Exhibition Road earlier
this week and that the people
there were very friendly and very
sincere about their faith. I would
hope that Members of the
Mormon Church would take the
opportunity to put forward their
side of the story.
Opinion articles will be a
regular feature in FELIX this year.
They represent your opportunity
to put forward your views.
Articles on any subject will be
accepted provided they are not
offensive or anonymous,
although, with good reason,
names may be withheld from
publication at the editor's
discretion.
The Union Refit. The refur-
bishment of the Union Refectory
and the Union Lounge is not
before time. Over the years the
Union Building has been allowed
to degenerate to its current
shabby state. It is not surprising
that students have shown little
interest in the Union and its
facilities. The -refit is the most
significant thing the Union have
carried out in a long time.
This issue would have been
much worse if it were not for the
valiant efforts of the staff. Thanks
to Dave Smedley for looking after
the news, Doug King for taking
the photographs, writing about
Cropredy and dashing across half
of London for a picture of
Kenneth Baker, Steve Meyfroidt
for his wacky pasteups, Dave
Clements and Nigel Baker for the
PG page, and Julian Butcher for
his opinion article.

Calling all Postgraduates
Postgraduate articles in FELIX are
usually very few and far between,
but that is now all going to change,
I hope. We have a PG reporter for
FELIX, we have three summer PG
FELIXES promised (this being
number two), and we have a new
and enthusiastic P G A O
(Postgraduate Affairs Officer,
namely myself, Dave Clements)
who is going to write some of these
articles. All in all the aim is to let you
all realise that there is a complete
college outside the lab with activities
to offer you and help to give you if
you are having problems, and that
there are plenty of people involved
in running the place who are trying
to make Imperial a better place to do
PhDs and MScs.
The first question you may well
ask, is what have we done up to
now? Aside from the social aspects
of the PG Group at IC (yes there is
one), which provides money for
departmental PG events, and
arranges some events centrally,
such as the PG Squash Tournament
you will have read about in the last
issue, we have been making it easier
for you to get help in departments
when things are going wrong. Up
until last year many departments
did not have a Postgraduate Tutor,
since such a post was not required
by College. I have certainly found
the PG Tutor in Physics, who have
had one for many years, to be very
helpful in offering impartial advice
on various aspects of my research.
The good news is that now the
College have seen that such posts
are a good idea and have asked
every department to assign a
member of staff to the position of
Postgraduate Tutor. You'll find a list
of these below. You can now go and
see these people if you have any
problems you need impartial advice
on, or to discuss matters you do not
feel you are able to discuss with
your supervisors.
However, we are not going to
stop there. While the PG Tutors will
be able to help with individual
problems, more general difficulties
and comments, about lecture
courses for example, or PG common
rooms, are not so easily handled by
this route. Traditionally
representations to departments on
such matters has been the job of the
Department Representatives (Dep
Reps) who are almost always
undergraduates. They do not feel
they can adequately represent PGs
and in many cases neither the PGs
or Dep Reps know that this is part
of their job. We are therefore
proposing a system of Postgraduate
Dep Reps. Once chosen/elected,
they will be responsible for PG
affairs within their department.
These will be mainly social and
academic matters. They will also sit
on the PG Affairs Committee with
the Union President and the PGAO.
To raise issues within their own
departments, they will be
encouraged to set up their own
departmental PG committees, with
help from the PGAO and Union
President, with representatives from
each research group or section. An
MSc representative should also sit
on the committee from each major
MSc course in the department. This
will result in a formal structure
through which PGs will be abie to
organise events and discuss
problems with their departments
and the Union. This is shown
below.
It is understood that some
departments already have
committees similar to these, and so
less work setting up the system will
need to be done in those areas.
Once these committees are set up
and running, it will then be possible
to ask College for a Senior PG Tutor
who would be responsible for all PG
academic matters. David
Goodgame, who will take over as
Senior College Tutor in October, is
in favour of this idea and so there
should be no real problems in
getting someone appointed to this
post. The Senior PG Tutor will come
from a different department from
the College Senior Tutor so that
students have the option of talking
to someone outside their
departments if they so wish.
At present undergraduate
students fill in lecturer evaluation
sheets at the end of the year so that
the performance of individual
lecturers can be assessed. It is hoped
that this will be extended to lectured
PG courses and PhD supervisors in
the near future, and it is proposed
that this will be done through the
PG committees.
There are some fairly radical ideas
in the scheme outlined above, with
the first major obstacle being the
traditional Postgraduate apathy
Dave Clements (PGAO)
about anything not directly related
to their field of study. However, we
jfeel that this is very important, both
'for helping individual PG students
through the problems that some
inevitably face^ and so as to improve
the overall level of supervision and
PG course at the College. This
should eventually lead to better
these submission rates and a
generally higher standard in IC
postgraduates.
What we need from the
postgraduates in the College now is
some feedback on the ideas we have
presented above and we'd also like
to hear form anyone interested in
becoming a PG Dep Rep. We will be
holding an open meeting in the
Union Dining Hall (that's on the
first floor of the Union Building) at
12.30pm on Thursday 1 September.
Anyone with comments on these
proposals will be most welcome, as
would anybody who is interested in
joining in with the social activities
of the PG Group, which will be
expanded next year.
We can, of course, discuss any
specific gripes or problems you have
there or after the meeting.
Hope to see you all at the PG
meeting on 1 September.
