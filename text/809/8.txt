The Rt Hon Kenneth Baker MP,
concerned over student union political
campaign spending.
Timothy Janman MP, in December.
The EDM, which is an undebated
statement of support for an issue
called for the Secretary of State for
Education and Science to take action
over the anomoly which allows the
NUS to run a 'closed shop' whilst
the 1987 Employment Act aims to
'significantly reverse closed shop
arrangements.' More recently, Mr
Janman proposed an amendment to
the Government Education Reform
Bill. The amendment has been
described by the NUS as an attempt
to outlaw union affiliation with
organisations which do not provide
goods or services.
Maeve Sherlock, NUS President
told FELIX that the amendment
could have affected union affiliation
with sports leagues as well as with
the NUS.
Sports
cup win
Imperial College has won the
Universities Athletic Union H G
Messer trophy for the most
improved College in this year's
mens' sports championships. The
mens' team came 12th out of 41
Colleges, an improvment of 22
places.
T Knew we'd done well by getting
a few teams in the top 16 but I didn't
think we'd done so well overall' said
Athletics Clubs' Committee Vice
Chairman, Mark Harris.
Imperial managed to achieve
places in the top sixteen in many of
the sports. The overall winners of
the Championship were
Loughborough University, with
Birmingham University in second
place. Imperial College has been a
member of the Universities Athletic
Union since 1983.
Further computer
thefts throughout
college
Since FELIX reported on computer
thefts two weeks ago a further
£14,000 worth of equipment has
been stolen.
Thieves operating between
Wednesday and Friday last week
have stolen two printers, one a laser
printer from Electical Engineering,
and a complete system valued at
over £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 from Mechanical
Engineering.
On two occasions keys were used
to gain access to the equipment,
leading College Security to believe
that current or ex-members of
Imperial College may be involved.
Security Officer Terry Briley
commented 'Imperial College is
here to produce research and we are
losing our product as a result of
these thefts'. He added that Security
were doing their best to control the
thefts but urged College members
to be more aware of security and to
lock doors and challenge strangers
at night.
Local crime prevention officers
will be co-operating with security to
advise freshers on crime prevention
next term.
Paper recycling
Project launched
The Ideal Paper Recycling Company depot receives another scrap paper delivery.
Imperial College Union has
launched an eight week project to
investigate paper recycling on
campus. The project aims to set up
a pilot recycling scheme at IC and
to produce a report for distribution
to other Universities, on the
scheme's feasibility.
The project is being funded by
Friends of the Earth and the
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Programme (UROP)
to the tune of £1000.
Richard Heap, the student
selected to conduct the study told
FELIX that white printed paper,
photocopier paper and
computerpaper where potential
sources of income. He said that
three recycling schemes were under
consideration mcluding a propsosal
by Westminster City Council which
would involve free refuse collection
in return for waste paper.
Trewin Restdrick told FELIX that
Friends of the Earth have received
a number of enquiries on paper
recycling in universities. He went on
to say that the project, if successful,
could be reciprocated in other
universities.
News
Evelyn
houses
merge
Mining House and Southwell
House, in Evelyn Gardens, are to be
joined to form a hall for 160 or so
students by the beginning of next
term. Ken Young, the present
Warden for Southwell House, will
be Warden for the new hall.
The decision to merger the houses
was taken when Catherine Brown,
Warden of Mining House, resigned
to complete her PhD and Mr Young
was appointed as Warden of
Southwell House. The move is in
line with the present Student
Residence Committee (SRC) policy
to move towards larger halls and
should lead to an overall increase in
the number of student rooms in the
hall.
The SRC are also to consider the
merger of Willis Jackson House and
Holbein House next year. SRC
Chairman, Brian Levitt told FELIX
that the present all male Holbein
House and the mixed Willis Jackson
House may be interchanged in time
for next year.
The cost of converting the two
houses into one, by knocking walls
through and converting triple rooms
into doubles and singles will be met
by funds left to the Coliege by Mr
P R Monk, an ex-lecturer at
Imperial. The legacy of around
£80,000 was left by Mr Monk to
provide accommodation for
members of staff. The new hall will
house Mr Young and his wife in a
larger Warden flat than is presently
available and will provide further
student rooms from the second
redundant Warden flat. The naming
of the new hall is currently under
debate although 'Southwell Hall'
and 'Monk Hall' have been
mentioned as possibilities. Imperial
College President, Nigel Baker, told
FELIX that he and Mr Young
preferred 'Monk Hall' as a possible
name since they felt that renaming
it 'Southwell Hall' could lead to ill-
feeling from Mining House drinking
club, "The Diggers'.
New!
Professor G. New, from the Physics
department, was appointed by the
college rector as chairman of the
Wardens Subcommittee on 22nd
August. Professor New replaces
former Linstead Hall warden,
Richard Clarke.
