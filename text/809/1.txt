Snack bar refit
goes ahead
The Union has allocated £40,000 to
refurbish the Union Snack Bar and
the Entertainments Lounge over the
Summer. Work has already begun
on the refit, which, the Union
hopes, will encourage more
students to use the Union facilities.
The new Snack Bar will contain
seating for one hundred people and
will feature a lowered ceiling and an
improved lighting system. The new
serving area has been designed to
reduce queueing time and will run
on a self service basis with an extra
till at peaktimes. The Uni6*n are
buying new cookers, a food mixer, a
dishwasher and new cutlery and
crockery for the Snack Bar. The new
Snack Bar will feature fabric
wallpaper and will be decorated in
what has been described as a subtle
red, white and blue style. In
addition, vending machines offering
confectionery, sandwiches, rolls and
hot and cold drinks will be installed
in the dining area.
A catering consultant has been
commissioned by the Union to
improve the range of food on offer.
Union Manager, David Peacock told
FELIX that new Snack Bar will be
geared towards healthy eating with
vegetarian, low sugar and low fat
foods. One or two meat dishes each
day are also planned. 'We are trying
to help people get into a good eating
kick,' he said.
The seating currently in the Snack
Bar will be moved into the
Entertainments Lounge. A new
stage is to be constructed in the
Lounge along with a new lighting
tower, paid for by the College, and
a storage area for Entertainments
Committee. The Dramatic Society
will be installing new disco lights for
the Union, and the Lounge will be
repainted. The room will be
carpeted and a Dance Floor
installed. Plans are also being
considered for a second food outlet
or a bar behind the serving hatch in
the lounge.
In the Union Bar, woodwork will
be sanded and stained and new
brass lighting is to be fitted. The
wooden panels at the bar entrance
are to be replaced with glass panels
in an attempt to make the bar more
welcoming and the stonework will
be cleaned.
Speaking on the modifications,
Deputy President Chas Brereton
said 'we have to compete with
College and offer a good service to
students. If we don't get them in the
first week we lose them forever.'
A raised dias originally planned
for installation in the Snack Bar over
the Summer has been delayed until
the Christmas vacation following a
disagreement within the Union
Office over the choice of contractors.
Union Deputy president, Chas
Brereton told FELIX that former
Union President, Sydney Harbour
Bridge had asked a second firm to
produce a quotation for the dias
when the original contractors,
Francis Bell and Austin were felt to
be too costly. When the new
contractors were found to be even
more expensive it was too late for
the original contractors to install the
dias in time.
In addition to the work being
funded by the Union, the College is
providing £20,000 to refurbish the
Union Central Staircase and the
main toilets. The toilets, currently a
gents, will be converted into toilets
for male and female students.
Union President Nigel Baker said
that he was relieved that work had
started and added 'the Snack Bar
will be a hell of a lot less like a
refectory'.
Student
Unions
surveyed
Student Unions are alarmed by a
nationwide survey launched by the
Department of Education and
Science (DES). The survey asks for
detailed breakdowns of union
finances, and voting procedures. It
also contains an extensive section
asking unions to evaluate the
services they receive from the
National Union of Students (NUS).
A twenty-one page questionnaire
has been circulated to the Vice-
Chancellors, Directors and
Principals in seventy universities,
polytechnics and colleges of further
education. Brunei, Heriot-Watt,
Bristol, Loughborough and
Newcastle Universities are amongst
those on the list. The questionnaires
are due for completion by October
31, after which the Government will
draw 'conclusions on the best action
to take.'
City College Union President,
Geoff Ellingham told FELIX that he
was surprised that the survey asks
students to quantify NUS services
in monetary terms.
University of London Union
(ULU) President, Stewart Jackson
said that ULU view the survey with
great concern and are very worried
about the ramifications for student
union autonomy.
The survey follows an
announcement by Secretary of State
for Education and Science, Kenneth
Baker, in April. Mr Baker said the
Government recognised that 'many
individual students do not wish to
be represented by °the National
Union of Students.' He went on to
say that taxpayers' money should be
used to provide services for students
and not for political campaigning.
The survey shows a number of
similarities to an Early Day Motion
on the 'National Union of Students
closed shop' put forward by
. continued on back page.
