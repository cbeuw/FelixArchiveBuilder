CROPREDY '88
The peaceful village of Cropredy in
Oxfordshire reeled last weekend
under the onslaught of thousands
of fans attending the Fairport
Convention annual reunion.
Cropredy, now the biggest festival
of its kind in Europe, ijt^aUy just
an excuse to hear s o r n # ^ ^ ^ » e s t ^
Folk/Folk Rock music flMpfffliiiil to.
consume vast quantilljrapjf beer.
This is apart from "tJie main
purpose—to bring the melp>ers o£
Fairport back together fd* theip
biggest gig of the year, and to unite
any ex-members of the band whey-
can make it. X2;
For the cjMMMhe entertammeftt
started otd tU|Tliday night-with a
line up J t j M j bands. First was a
set from a'i&nch ot cetf&iOckers.
Collaboration, who playe^'very fast
and exciting arrangements of
traditional Celtic tunes. Tfiey were
followed by an excellent solo
guitarist Mike Silver. But the set of
the evening was just over two hours
from The Richard Thompson Band.
Richard had been persuaded to
reform his original band for the
festival and will be going on tour
with them later in the year. Richard
has released two collaborative
albums in the past year, most
notably the soundtrack from the
BBC series The Marksman, and has
an album of his own due out in the
autumn.
Thousands of people camped out
during the weekend. Those
unfortunate enough to be on the far
side of the site had about a half mile
walk back.'More people turned up
by car on Saturday and by the time
F&irport came on the festival field
was packed to capacity. Weeks had
^beenlspent constructing the vast
stagtf with superb lighting effects
and!an overpowering PA. It was
possible to sit in your tent on the
campsite and catch every note.
.^Saturday dawned clear and bright
/ b u t by lunchtime, and the start of
the entertainment, rain was
threatening. The first peformance
was from Sally Barker. Sally plays
guitar and sings a very classy blend
of contemporary and blues. Despite
having to perform first she did an
excellent job ofj jg the crowd

Next was the superb Filarfolket
f r o n W S j ^ e n . TfefiPgroup has
b e c o m e . ^ vvldely acclaimed
throughout Europe and Cropredy
provided a rare opportunity to see
them perform in this country.
Filarfoket play a very exciting and
danceable blend of traditional
Swedish folk with distinctly Afro-
Carribean rythms. This band also
delighted the crowd by persuading
June Tabor to make a surprise
performance. In fact, the band so
impressed the crowd that the
number of encores considerably
delayed the appearance of the next
act.
By now it had started to rain but
most people huddled under
umbrellas or polythene rather than
miss The Steve Gibbons Band. Steve
emerged onto the Birmingham
scene in the late 60s and joined the
stable of the Who in 1975. Steve has
continually produced a high
standard of music though
superstardom has elluded him.
Next came Dan Ar Bras with his
electric band. Dan joined Fairport
briefly in 1977 before starting his
solo career. He played a selection of
traditional melodies and his own
compositions using the latest in
electric music technology.
By this time the crowd were
packed into the field and in a state
of riotous enthusiasm waiting for
the event of the weekend. Fairport
Convention
was formed
in 1967 and
over the years
has churned out
albums and undergone
numerous changes of lineup. The
band broke, up in - l^?9~4injy to
reform almost immediate!y718|;ely
unchanged since then.
It is since MMtand's reformation
that they have'been holding annual
reunions 1 Dave Pegg (Bass,
Mandoline)*- and Martin Allcock
(midti-instrumerit51) fleWBSck from
Brazil, two days before the festival,
where they had been playing with
Jethro Tull, abandoning Ian
Anderson and company in mid-
tour. Dave Mattacks' (drums,
keyboards) has spent much of the
year touring with Ashley
Hutchings' All Stars, apart from
being in demand for session work
with all sorts of famous names.
Apart from opening for Tull on their
US tour with Simon Nicol (guitar,
vocals), Ric Sanders (electric fiddle)
has been working with Andy
Cronshaw.
June Tabor•
In addition to the current lineup
Fairport invited back Jerry Donahue
who has most recently been
supporting Gerry Rafferty on his
album North and South, and Chris
Rea on Dancing with Strangers. Also
joining Fairport for their set were
Richard Thompson and two Welsh
lovelies Sheila and Sheryl Parker
who provided additional vocals.
The set started with a few classic
numbers including Joni Mitchell's
Carrie sung by the Parker Sisters,
several Richard Thompson numbers
and a brief selection of
instrumentals from Jerry's first solo
album. After that the guests put in
only brief appearances leaving
Fairport to get on with their
business.
Simon Nicol's vocals were as
vibrant and evocative as ever. Peggy
(Dave Pegg) played several very
lively mandolin pieces as well as
bass. Martin Alcock, as usual,
