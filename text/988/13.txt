The Afterglow of Creation Football
Attending a lecture given by the Science Editor
of New Scientist seems an appropriate pastime
for someone who wants to be a science jour-
nalist. Marcus Chown was the editor, I the
wannabe at the MathSoc lecture on Friday 21st
January.
Having thus enticed me to hear him speak,
Chown stepped up to the microphone in the
gleaming Clore Lecture Theatre to talk on the
subject of this new book Afterglow Of Creation.
This Afterglow refers to the microwave radi-
ation which permeates the entire universe and is
all that remains of the Big Bang. The discovery
in 1992 of 'ripples' in this background radiation
by the C O B E satellite caused a comparative
deluge of media coverage. Stephen Hawking
proclaimed it "the discovery of the century" and
one COBE scientist declared that it was "like
seeing the face of God".
Chown, regarding these claims as extrava-
gant, chose to present a different perspective -
not a cold 'scientific view' but a true reflection
of the story of cosmic ripples beginning from
Edwin Hubble's first notion of an expanding
universe in the 1920s. By contrasting brilliant
flashes of inspiration (or was it a gamma ray
burster?) with periods when experiments were
painfully inconclusive, Chown had not only a
good storyline but a convincing sub-plot about
the way in which science is done.
As I bought a copy of his book after the
lecture, I explained my ulterior motives as a
science journalism hopeful. It was worth sitting
through the extra twenty minutes of the lecture -
he gave me his phone number.

How I Learned To Stop Worrying
As part of SCC Ideological Week, ICSF presents
on Monday in Chem Eng LT1 THX 1138 (6pm
start) and Dr Strangelove (Or How I Learned to
Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb) (8pm start).
THX 1138 is George Lucas's first film, a
bleak and nihilistic exploration of state control
where names are reduced to numbers, individu-
ality is suppressed and love outlawed. This stark
film is a far cry from Lucas's later interstellar
pyrotechnics with the Star Wars trilogy.
Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove is a dark
wartime comedy in the Catch 22 tradition star-
ring Peter Sellers as lots of people, but most
memorably as the eponymous, but not at all
Nazi, Dr Strangelove.
Both films are free to all students.
There is no ICSF film this week due to the
SCC screening of The Last Temptation of Christ
(see article).
IC 2nds 2 -1 Royal Holloway 2nds
Last Wednesday the Imperial College 2nd X I
played the 'bete noir' of IC football, Royal
Holloway, with a team whose players could
speak eleven different languages, but did not
have a regular goalkeeper. It was a game of two
halves. The first half was a blend of inharmo-
nious attacking by Holloway and a moderate
amount of possession football by IC.
After the interval, Imperial started to domi-
nate the match with neat passing and the opposi-
tion looked certain to succumb. But it's a funny
old game and it was Holloway who scored first
with a controversial goal reminiscent of
Cuellemans against the U S S R in 1986.
Undeterred, IC continued to attack and were
rewarded with an equaliser by a superb 30 yard
free-kick by Abs Said. Issam Morris, playing
with an injured arm, not unlike Beckenbauer
against Italy in 1970, scored another quality
goal for Imperial a few minutes later, when he
confounded the Holloway defence and slotted
the ball away with a clinical finish.
In the last few minutes of the game, IC
defended their lead with a valiant performance
similar to Italy against Brazil in 1982. There
were a number of notable incidents. Anthony
'Cantona' Clerc practised his volleyball skills,
Chris Collison tried to mutilate opponents and
there was a superlative performance by
Mubarak Choudhry, who stood in for the
A W O L Mark Nally. This was the first league
victory for the seconds this season, and at the
end of the day it was two points in the bag.

And behold! Allah will say:
"O Jesus the son of Mary!
Didst thou say unto men , worship me
and my mother
As gods in derogation of Allah'? "
He will say: " Glory to Thee !
Never could I say what I had no right
(to say).
Had I said such a thing, thou would
indeed have known it.
Thou knowest what is in my heart,
though I know not what is in Thine.
For Thou knowest in full all that is
hidden.
" Never said I to them aught except
what Thou didst command me to say,
to them,
' Worship Allah, my Lord and your
Lord';
And I was a witness over them whilst I
dwelt amongst them;
When Thou didst take me up Thou
wast the watcher over them, and
Thou art a witness to all things.
