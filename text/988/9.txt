Defcon 1 - IC Takes NATO
European Strike Command
Rallies
NATO's European Strike Command Headquar-
ters at RAF Greenham Common was opened as
a paintball site on 9th January. Several zillion
acres of disused airbase, complete with barracks
and escape slides, were transformed into
Europe's foremost urban paintball site.
Imperial's paintball team, the Smoking
Beagles (not to be confused with North
London's first all-Jewish bakery paintball team,
the Smoking Bagels), were part of a select band
of invitees present to preview the site and more
importantly, taint with paint.
Over a hundred such people were present,
ready to get reasonably tired and bruised for fun.
The day's festivities were marked by the initial
division of those present into politically-incor-
rect Russians and Americans. Imperial, much in
line with the general public's perception of the
political inclination of students, were marked as
Communists as soon as we walked in.
And so, the Smoking-Beagalists teamed up
with other well-meaning but armed-to-the-teeth
lefties to beat the living crap out of those weak-
willed democratic Americano alleged free-
thinkers. And we did. Eight games throughout
the day and eight outright wins to the Reds.
Basking in the sweet success of a crushing
victory for the Warsaw Pact, the remainder of
the day was spent divvying up Europe into
extensions of the Balkan regions.
Students at the Lenin-Gorbachev College of
Science, Technology and Medicine (previously
known as Imperial College under enslaved
Capitalist rule) can experience close-quarters
combat on 19th February, when SplotSoc-ski
will take a bus-load to RAF Greenham Common.
Be there or be in the three-mile long bread queue.
For details of SplotSoc's trips, come to a
SplotSoc meeting on Tuesdays 12.30pm-
1.30pm, Southside Upper Lounge.
Wahiba Sands - An Odyssey
Nigel Winser, Deputy President of the Royal
Geographical Society, will give an illustrated
account of his expedition to the Wahiba Desert
in Oman. Forty members travelled by Landrover
and Oman military helicopters, into this wilder-
ness to study amongst many things, the move-
ment of the sands in the area. For those thinking
of planning an expedition, Nigel is a wealth of
knowledge and well worth speaking to.
The talk will be on February 10th at 6pm in
the Clore Lecture Theatre (Maths). Entrance is
free for members and £1 for non-members. For
details about the Exploration Society see us in
Southside, Tuesday lunchtimes.
Last Friday City & Guilds Motor Club held
'The Essex Lanes Rally', a storming 70 mile
route through white handbag and stilettos
county. The crews blasted off at 9pm from
Harlow Town Train Station as inconspicuously
as possible (i.e. not very!) into the Essex lanes.
Christian Enderby and Garrett O'Connor
took the lead after the first Time Control (TCI).
They held off the Toyota MR2 of Simon Childs
and Grant Savell until TC4, when some tricky
navigation lost them over ten minutes. The rest
of the field was led by Gavin Pratt and Joe
Baguley in their Peugot 205. The rear was
brought up by the modified M i n i of Matt
Whitfield and John Owen, which had an exhaust
loud enough to kill small children at 50 paces.
The crews roared to the finish at 12.30am.
After totting up the time sheets, Simon and
Grant were declared winner, just pipping
Christian and Garrett to the post. Third place
went to Gavin and Joe, with Rosy and Charlie
the highest place novice crew in fourth place.
The next rally is on Friday 25th February. If
this sounds like fun, come to the Rally Meeting
on Wednesday 23rd February (details next
week). Rallies are held on Friday night/Saturday
morning and involve solving clues to define a
route then racing along it as quickly as you can.
Don't worry if you don't have a car, there are
always drivers looking for budding navigators!
