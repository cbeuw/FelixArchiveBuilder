Lesson 2. Anagrams
Everybody's favourite clue is the anagram.
There are two ways of spotting an anagram.
Firstly, you can count the letters of an unusual
set of words (they might contain an apos-
trophe). Secondly, there should be an anagram-
indicator. Here's an anagram clue:
Hear cat scramble up pipe (7)
This is an anagram of 'Hear cat'
indicated by the words 'scramble up'.
and is

H £
A R C
A T
There are hundreds of anagram-indicators -
they can imply disorder, movement, rewriting,
mixing or almost anything remotely suggesting
abnormality. There are obviously too many to
list here so just dive into these simple
examples:
1. Tim is so upset about the separation (7)
2. Get richer while rate is slashed (9)
3. Hawaiian dances at a lush resort (5)
4. Lead astray in the valley (4)
5. So I ban absurd little trees (6)
6. Alter U N resolution for the car manufacturer
(7)
[See also clues 7 & 28 across and 5 & 16 down
above.]
Two anagram-indicators to be wary of are
'about' and 'out'. They can be cunningly
disguised in the clue and what's more they can
also imply other cryptic operations.
Lesson 3. Splitting Words
Dividing a word up into two or more parts is a
very common trait of cryptic clues.
Occasionally a word is constructed from two
consecutive words. Take A N T E L O P E :
Insect to run away with a gazelle (8)
A N T + ELOPE = ANTELOPE
or C A T A C O M B :
• Felix leads a search for buried cemetery (8)
CAT + A + COMB = C A T A C O M B
Felix obviously implies C A T . Don't take too
much notice of the word 'leads': here it just
means that the word C A T comes first and is put
in to make the clue read better. Notice how 'a
search' suggests a noun but it is actually the
word A followed by the verb C O M B . The
following examples have the straightforward
definition in italics.
7. Steer clear of a hole (5)
8. Gaunt monarch is meditating (8)
9. Find a record again (8)
10. Knave pockets the winnings (8)
11. Pleases happy hideaways (8)
12. Fish come in like Jesus (9)
[Try 13 across above.]
Perhaps equally common is the answer
consisting of a word inside a word.
Reconsidering the answer to clue 12,
C A R P E N T E R is also the word P E N inside
C A R T E R :
Former president holds pen for woodcutter (9)
Look out for phrases like 'put into', 'gets
inside', 'goes round' or 'put about' etc:
13. Friend goes round and gets authority (7)
14. Raced around peak and then finished (6)
15. Isolated father gets into art (5)
