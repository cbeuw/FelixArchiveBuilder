UGM Under Threat Excellent!
BY LYNN BRAVEY
The days of the Union General
Meeting (UGM) could be num-
bered. Due to the poor attendance
of these meetings, the Union
President, Andrew Wensley, has
suggested that a Student Represen-
tative Council (SRC) be formed.
Last week's meeting attracted a
around 50 students - less than 1%
of students in College. Speaking at
the U G M on Friday M r Wensley
stated: "This committee would be
responsible for the governing of
Imperial College Union (ICU) and
would replace UGMs. All members
of ICU would be able to attend and
speak at such meetings, though
only members of the Council
would be able to vote. We think
this will solve the problem of the
obvious lack of interest in UGMs."
The proposal has met strong
opposition from students. Many
have expressed a feeling that drop-
ping the U G M will take away the
students' voice in their Union.
Departmental Representatives and
Union Officers would have to
undertake a larger responsibility to
represent students views. Felix
asked Rhian Picton, President of
the Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU), her views on the
abolition of the U G M .
"The formation of an SRC could
be the right way to get communica-
tion going. The U G M s at the
moment are a complete farce, with
Officers only going if asked to by
the people they're supposed to be
representing. There is however a
danger of it [the SRC] becoming a
self-perpetuating body with an
enclosed circle of people. I can't
see how one person could possibly
represent the views of all those
they are supposed to.
"For example, a Dep Rep
[Departmental Representative] may
have to put forward the views of,
say, 600 students. This would
increase the workload of the Dep
Reps by a huge amount and there is
also no way of knowing i f the
officer is expressing the views of
their department or their own. I
also have to question the proposed
idea of having Hall Representatives
on the SRC. The principle is good,
with the idea of getting more first
years involved in the Union, but the
Hall Reps are more likely to be
second or third year re-apps. Again,
it has to be questioned whether one
person could possibly represent all
the people in one Hall.
"For example, the combined
Hall of Willis Jackson and Holbein
has 180 residents. There is no
communal area, so the only way a
Hall Rep could hear the views of
everyone in the hall would be to
knock on each individual door and
ask. This, of course, would take a
huge amount of time and it's
doubtful that anyone would actu-
ally do that. The current problems
with UGMs at the moment are not
helped by the bad level of commu-
nication.
"Receiving agendas on time
would help for a start. There is
often a lot of confusion at UGMs
and things aren't explained as they
go along. This can't do much to
promote an interest in Union affairs
now can it?"

Imperial College's Management
School has been rated 'excellent'
by the Higher Education Funding
Council for England (HEFCE).
The School received the top
rating following an intensive three
day assessment by a panel from the
Council. The team, consisting of
senior academics, is one of many
involved in evaluating every
university's business and manage-
ment departments this year.
The Director of the Management
School, Professor David Norburn,
declared himself delighted with the
outcome. He commented: "This
results from the strong partnership
we have built between the business
community - whose needs we serve
- our students and the school's
faculty. Our success reflects on all
the parties involved."
The Management School is the
second department of Imperial
College to achieve an excellent
rating in the H E F C E assessment.
Their success follows that of the
Department of Chemistry.
