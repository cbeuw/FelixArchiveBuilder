Union 21
Thinking of running for a sabbatical post? Then here's a bit about what eac
of them involves and some datesfor your diary. . .
President
The President - who he? Whilst the
other sabbaticals have specific areas
of responsibility, the President is
responsible for the Union as a
whole.
I have to try ensure that the
Union is kept in a healthy state of
development, from its structure to
its work in all areas of College. I am
responsible for academic and wel-
fare representation within College,
the representation of student opinion
inside Imperial from its lowest to its
highest level. Outside IC, I have to
represent the Union's members
views to all we come into contact
with. Inside the Union, I am
responsible with the Union Manager
for all staffing issues.
How is this done? As Dave says
in his bit, by talking to people. This
takes up a huge chunk of every day,
discussing issues with students,
union officers, staff and College
officials, anyone from a first year
Chemist to the Rector. After that,
you have to make sure that it has an
effect, that people's concerns, prob-
lems and ideas are put into practice.
Often this can take a lot of time,
energy and work. Sometimes ideas
are not put into practise, problems
are sometimes not solved. Although
this can be discouraging, you have
to start again on a new issue or
maybe find a new angle to get an
old problem resolved.
The job can and will take up a lot
of time, but you meet a cross section
of public and College life. There
may be problems ahead, but the
personal reward in succeeding to
solve is great. Like Charlie, I think
it's a great post for job satisfaction
but like Dave, I'm glad I'm only
doing it for one year.
To know more, pop into the
Union Office, in Beit Quad, I'm free
to talk to everyone about the job
anytime (all questions answered).
Or just give me a call, 3501 (work),
3511 (home).
Deputy President (Finance & Services)
What do I do? Mainly, money,
trading and talking to people. The
money side involves chairing the
Finance Committee (which makes
decisions on the Union's finances,
such as clubs and societies budgets),
keeping an eye on expenditure (I
have to authorise any amount over
Â£500) and checking over budgets for
events. Basically, my job is to make
sure all that all our money is spent
properly.
I am the chair of the Bookstore
and Refectory Services committees,
which oversee the management of
the bar, snack bar and bookstore.
One of the things I've been doing
this year is having regular meetings
with the staff managers of these
outlets, so I should know about all
that's going on with them.
Talking to people is a pretty
wide-ranging description of the rest
of what I do - this includes taking
up accommodation matters with
college, discussing financial prob-
lems with clubs, sitting on a number
of college committees (including
Governing Body) and working on
various things with the other Union
officers and members of staff.
There are also a number of other
things I do, such as: games &
vending machines, minibuses,
telephones, Union cards, security,
building projects, having to write
things like this, eating and sleeping
(occasionally), etc, etc, etc.
If anyone is interested in the fun
and groovy (no, really) job of DP
(F&S) and wants to know more,
then pop in and see me in the Union
Office for a chat. Basically, the job
is a good one (most of the time), but
I'm glad I'm only doing it for one
year.
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
With elections approaching it makes
me wonder how many people know
what it is that sabbaticals do. Some
people will know what the job of
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) entails, but most people
will not. The people who do will
almost certainly be those involved
in the Union already. If you are
thinking of standing, but know very
little about ICU, then don't let this
factor put you off.
Sabbaticals are trained for one
month by the person vacating that
post. This means that the training is
done by the person that knows that
job the best. If you don't know the
difference between a C C U and an
M S C then this is not a problem.
What you do need is determination
to do a good job, a friendly dis-
position and a keen interest in
helping people. Experience in clubs
and societies is a good background,
but not essential.
Everyone is involved in some
activity and there is a colossal range
run by the Union. The Deputy Pres-
ident does not run these activities.
The job involves overlooking the
running of these activities and
giving advice to the people organ-
ising them. Problems will always
appear and the Deputy President is
there to ensure that these are solved.
The job also involves day to day
clubs administration, for example
insurance, room bookings, publicity,
sports and of course Freshers' Fair.
The job involves representing
clubs views to College. This is a
chance to play your part in ensuring
that important decisions that are
made reflect the students views.
It is a very full time job, but the
rewards in terms of job satisfaction
are potentially immense. If you are
considering standing for this post
then feel free to come into the
Union Office to find out more.
Felix Editor & Print Unit Manager
So, you want to be Felix Editor?
Well, you will not only be editing a
weekly magazine, you will be the
manager of a Print Unit. Don't let
this put you off. If you've had no
experience in the printing world,
that doesn't matter and the same
goes for editing; you'll be taught all
you need to know and you'll soon
pick it up.
Felix Editor. The job of editing
Felix involves not only reading
through and edition what goes into
each issue, it's defending the con-
cept of editorial freedom. For years,
the motto of Felix has been 'Keep
the Cat Free'. This not only refers to
supplying it free of charge, but also
keeping the content editorially free.
Felix Editors have always fought to
keep the right to print what they feel
is what the students want, rather
than what College and the Union
want them to print. Even though
some of the money to produce Felix
comes from College through the
Union, what's the use of having a
paper which cannot report on the
goings-on in its own College?
Print Unit Manager. Although
the printing of Felix takes priority,
other print work is taken on to help
to generate the money to replace the
equipment (printer, collator, binder
and guillotine). The equipment
should therefore be kept in use as
much as possible. Managing the
Print Unit means organising the
printing schedule in conjunction
with the Printer (a permanent
member of staff), making sure that
all the work is completed on time
and ensuring that the machinery is
used effectively.
Feel free to come and have a chat if
you want to know more.
