C&GCU Make Spanner Inviolate
The Guilds Mascotry Team ensuring that Spanner is safely returned to the Guilds Office
after its appearance at a Guilds event

City and Guilds College Union
(C&GU)Spanner and Bolt have
been declared inviolate mascots by
the . The two mascots are to attend
more events in an attempt to
increase the awareness of their
existence and to restart an interest
in mascotry, according to a letter
circulated by the C & G U . Spanner
and Bolt are now not allowed to be
'kidnapped' by the other two
constituent college unions or other
student unions until midnight on
31st October 1994.
Felix asked Steve Hoborough,
C & G C U Vice-President, why the
action had been taken. " A t the
moment the whole mascotry thing
has died a death. Very few students
seem to be interested in it anymore.
It's a shame, really, because people
used to be proud of which college
they represented. It seems that
these days the average student is
more concerned about working
hard and getting their degree; the
fun side of being a part of the
College is generally ignored. We're
[C&GCU] hoping that seeing that
the union has two rather nice
mascots might stir peoples pride.
Mascotry raises money for Rag
(Unions have to pay a 'ransom' to
get their mascot back) and is
supposed to be a fun game."
Interest in mascotry has
decreased enormously in recent
years following an accident in
Imperial College in 1991. During
an attempted raid of Theta, the
six-foot brass thermometer and
mascot of the Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU), one bearer
suffered a broken leg. The bearer,
Steve Dorman, was hit by a van
during a scuffle with the C & G C U
raiders outside the Albert Hall. Joe
Fernley, of C & C G U , said at the
time "One reason that everything...
got so serious is the fact that Theta
hasn't been stolen for so long. This
sets up a vicious circle where the
current bearers have so much pres-
sure on them that they will do
anything to protect their belove'd
lump of stainless including not
bringing it out for ages at a time."
The current 641b Spanner was
made in 1964 by the Mechanical
Engineering Department. It was
cast out of the brass from spent
cartridges which the Rifle Club
collected over three years. Bolt was
cast out of chrome steel three years
later. The last time Spanner and
Bolt were stolen, a ransom of
Â£1,320 was demanded (ten times
their combined weight). Theta, who
celebrates her birthday on 20th
February, hasn't been stolen since
1973.
Meanwhile the Imperial College
Union mascot, Mike the Micro-
meter, is acting as a very large
paper weight in Andy Wensley's
office and is keeping a low profile.
A doctor who trained at St Mary's
Hospital Medical School was one
of the six skiers killed in an
avalanche on Saturday.
The accident, which took place
at Val d'Isere in the French Alps,
caused the death of five British
doctors and their French ski guide.
The last member of the party, Dr
Christopher Ackner, survived,
spending a night in sub-zero
temperatures in a snow hole.
The party were on the last day
of a week long visit to the region,
which combined a medical confer-
ence with a skiing holiday. Doctors
Howard Fleet, Ann Gillingham,
Jeremy Gillingham, Jan Hofmeyr,
Clare Webber and guide Hugo
Ferrier were named on Sunday as
those who died. A l l members of the
party were accomplished skiers.
The avalanche occurred on
Saturday morning, while the skiers
were on an off-piste tour from
Tigres to Champagny. Although the
high winds of the previous day had
eased, much of the area was still on
'red flag' - the second highest level
of avalanche alert.
The alarm was not raised until
Sunday morning. When mountain
rescue helicopters picked up the
alarm signals from the skiers'
emergency bleepers, they found
five of the party dead.
One of the dead, Dr Claire
Webber (33), had qualified through
the University of London and
trained at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School. She had a practice
based in Buckinghamshire, and was
described by a colleague as "totally
professional, the sort of woman you
could ring up at four o'clock in the
morning and she wouldn't
grumble." Her father said: "She
was devoted to her profession and
she was also a great sportswoman.
She particularly loved skiing."
The Felix team would like to
express their condolences to the
friends and relatives of those
caught in the avalanche.
