Well that’s all folks. Laura Marling has made a late surge and finally made it into

people play “Keep The Car Running” on constant repeat all summer. Kadhim
Felix’s essential summer playlist
The first offering in six years from the
Californian stoner hip-hop troupe,
there’s a lot you’ll find familiar about
this latest CD. It starts slowly, with a
couple of tracks that could have been
taken from almost any of their old al-
bums, albeit this time with a bored-
sounding Tom Morello going through
the big-riff motions in the background.
Still, it gets better: they still have an ear
for a tune, and tracks like Get It Any-
way and K.U.S.H. will still have you
pulling ‘West-Side’ white-boy dance
moves in your living room. Sure, the
album’s still full of the old stoner cliché
stuff, designed solely to outrage Daily
Mail reading parents while delighting
their 13-year-old offspring, but that
said it’s still pretty good fun.

PRIORITY
ALBUM
A weird mix of styles and influences,
there’s potential for this lot to be some
fun - but not until they work out what
they want to sound like. The drummer
and bassist want to be in a death metal
band, while the vocalist is happy turn-
ing out Blink-182-style, radio friendly
punk-pop. The end result is confused
and patchy, but good in places: think of
a Bullet For My Valentine that have got
the joke, or a Lostprophets with a bit
less ego and you won’t be too far off.

Reviews
It has been a
privilege and a
lot of fun
Y
es we’ve reached the end.
The absolute, immuta-
ble end. Let me begin by
thanking my co-Editors
Alex, Luke and Chris and
everyone who has contributed this
year; Duncan Casey, Jamie Fraser, Lily Le,
Greg Power, Hugh Crail, Emily Beech, Joan-
na Cai, Eliot Barford, Andy Roast, Richard
Waldie, Craig Glastonbury, Mariam Zahedi,
Holly Cumbers, Ben Cook, Jon Richens, Robin
Andrews, Emilie Beauchamp, Ed Knock,
Barnaby Walker, Jack Massey, Stuart Hig-
gins, Michael Inkpen, Katie Clemence, Kate
Smith, Matthew Stringer, Sophie Okell, Tom
Jennings, Dan Wan, Renny Norman, Rhys
Davies and Flavian Vansyngel.
It’s been an absolute privilege to be
Music Editor, and a whole lot of fun. I
got free tickets to loads of gigs and man-
aged to grow a sizeable CD collection
along the way. Most importantly, I’m
now able to hold a conversation about
music without wondering why farm
tools like “Pitchfork” keep cropping up.
I hope that you’ve enjoyed reading
the section too. We made an effort to
have a lot of content each week. That
meant doing shorter gig and album re-
views but to be honest, we didn’t think
there was much point in doing long,
overwrought reviews; we wanted to let
you know about as much music as pos-
sible and with a little prodding, let you
make your own mind.
My one regret is that we didn’t spend
time publicising musicians at Imperial.
The worry was that we couldn’t do it
in a way that wouldn’t offend fellow
students but that was also credible, i.e.
you the reader didn’t think we were
just being nice for the sake of it. It’s a
problem that I hope next year’s Music
team will overcome because there is a
great deal of talent at Imperial and at
the very least their own student news-
paper should be open to them.
Finally, get involved next year. Peo-
ple always tell me that they’re worried
about their writing being poor and my
response every time is that the only
reason that my writing is passable now
is that I’ve practised. You’ve got to start
somewhere and felix is probably the
best place. We’ll give you tips and iron
out any problems and we’d never turn
our noses up at your writing. Because
if we did, you could always pull out the
first articles that we wrote and THAT
would truly be embarrassing.
