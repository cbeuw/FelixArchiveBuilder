A
fraction of a millimeter
thick and yet it keeps us
warm and cools us down;
tells a story through
marks, tattoos and scars;
identifies us but still protects our
hidden depths - both the figurative
and visceral. It flakes off every other
day, yet we spend hours scrutinising,
cleansing, toning, exfoliating, mois-
turising and tanning it, all in pursuit
of perfect skin. Our skin is surely the
most ephemeral of all our organs, but
is also the border between what we
perceive (the outside world) and how
we perceive. It bridges the gap between
knowing and not knowing, and is thus
a most appropriate theme for explora-
tion by the Wellcome Collection in the
recently opened ‘Skin’.
The exhibition snakes its way
through the pleasantly lit and cool
space, examining skin in every context
imaginable, beginning with medical
écorché drawings from the fifteenth
century - anatomical depictions of the
human body with the skin removed,
each muscle striation meticulously
captured. Early medicine had little re-

gard for our outer encasing, dispens-
ing of it and seeing it as a barrier to
our discovery of our inner “truth”. It
was not until the eighteenth century
that the profession of dermatology de-
veloped whereby each affliction of the
skin was carefully studied and cures
discovered: on display are some of the
early wax models which were used in
the medical profession as a means of
profiling diseases of the skin.
Intermingled with the medical mod-
els, drawings and diagrams also lies a
huge host of art, ranging from Renais-
sance oil paintings to modern photog-
raphy, animation and sculpture such
as Tamsin van Essen’s ceramic apoth-
ecary jars, the surfaces of which have
been pocked, speckled and cracked to
resemble syphilis, acne and psoriasis.

ages sit metres away from a beautifully
preserved Peruvian mummy, dating
back to 1200 AD, with its hair intact
and even the skin of its eyelids still
stretched over the eye sockets. Other
cultural artefacts include an essay doc-
umenting how native South American
women would swap their husbands
for the Spanish conquistadores on ac-
count of the latter’s superior love mak-
ing skills.
The Wellcome Collection has catered
for all tastes and levels of squeamish-
ness, with the beautiful photography
contained in ‘Xterior VIII’ by Desiree
Dolron sitting just around the corner
from Win Delvoye’s video Sybille II, a
five minute close up of blackheads be-
ing burst. Weirder still are the note-
books supposedly bound in human
skin and the skin samples from nine-
teenth century France withthe tattoos
still visible on them.
Less interesting but more interac-
tive is the Skin Lab, which concludes
the exhibition. Visitors can engage
with some of the latest advances in
skin technology and also try on the
latex, stomach turning SkinBag gar-
ments which recall Buffalo Bill from
The Silence of the Lambs and his aim
of making a “woman suit” out of real
skin. Perhaps less extreme is the tat-
too competition where entrants have
the chance to design a tattoo for ink-
enthusiast Caisa Ederyd. The winner
will have their tattoo etched forever on
Casia’s skin in a live tattooing event on
July 22.
Skin is definitely the most fascinat-
ing organ culturally and scientifically
and the unerring Collection gives us a
highly diverse array of curiosities to in-
clude in the latest of their ever thought
provoking exhibitions. A treasure
chest of wonders, this is a perfect com-
bination of art, science and the strange.

B
eing Arts Editor has been a
wonderful and enlighten-
ing part of my life for the
last three years. So much
so that I thought of myself
more as a journalist and editor than as
a biochemist or business school stu-
dent. It is with sadness and reluctance
that I write my final editorial for felix
Arts.
Before going I will impart you with
a little “formula” I subconsciously use
when considering art:
1-Skill: the skill which has been nec-
essary to and deployed in creating said
piece of art.
2-Aesthetic: how beautiful the work
of art is to you.
3-Concept: a piece of art may be
hideous to look at, but the ingenu-
ity or originality of the idea may be
outstanding.
4-Impact: All three of the above cri-
teria may displease you but, somehow,
the work of art still stirs something
inside you or rekindles a long lost
memory.
This is highly subjective and should
not by any means be taking too seri-
ously - the beauty of art is that its inter-
pretation is up to the viewer entirely.
Art does not know who has an Art de-
gree and who does not!
I hope you have enjoyed reading the
arts section as much as I have done
creating it. I will leave you with a quo-
tation from a beautiful book - Narcis-
sus and Goldmund by the revered Her-
man Hesse - as food for thought:
“We fear death, we shudder at life’s
instability, we grieve to see the flowers
wilt again and again, and the leaves
fall, and in our hearts we know that we,
too, are transitory and will soon disap-
pear. When artists create pictures and
thinkers search for laws and formulate
thoughts, it is in order to salvage some-
thing from the great dance of death, to
make something last longer than we do.
