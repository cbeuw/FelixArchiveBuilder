Hangman interviews... Hangman (himself)
FELIX Editors Encourage Newcomers!
Ed Knock, Awesome Film Editor
‘Watching a film is like gazing through a win-
dow into your own soul’
“ Hey I’m Ed Knock the Awesome Film Editor. I
actually put the ‘Awesome’ in there myself, but
I’ve always been known for my outlandish ways
and I think it makes me look edgy.
I’m not really known for who I am, but for
what I do - and that’s write!!!!!!!! You probably
read my film reviews and think, ‘I’ll never be able
to write like this’ or ‘he’s so incredibly insightful;
I would never have made that connection be-
tween The Nutty Professor 2 and the Chadian-
Libyan conflict,’ but you can because I believe in
you. You see I don’t just write, I believe!
I’ve taken my fans on an emotional journey
of self-discovery, whilst instilling my boundless
knowledge of film. Come down to Felix next
year and try to do the same thing! I believe!’’
Gilead Amit, Deputy Editor
‘I’m not playing God; I’ve already played God,
And I won!’
“Ahh, bathe in my glorious deep ethereal tones
and regard me in awe! Hold thy tongue, for I,
Gilead Amit, would converse with some jibber-
ing flailing retard before practising the noble art
of discourse with thou!
Harrumph! The sheer notion of literary neo-
phytes uniting with Felix veterans such as my-
self, Gilead Amit, piques and repulses me to the
brink of a volatile fireworks performance, host-
ed by my own gizzard, gullet and mouth!
Oh and on another note, just because you
can’t find a real fucking root for negative one,
doesn’t mean I, Gilead Fucking Amit, can’t; And
no I’m not going to have a fucking coffee with
you weird thirteen-year old girls and Fuck you
Emmanuel College, seriously, FUCK YOU!!!!!!!
Dan Wan, Proper Editor
“ It’s been a pleasure to work with me and I’m
confident that I’m passing the torch on to a
guy that will most likely drop it or blow it out”
“ӍʿࣅӇέщӁϷ‫׻‬ദܾ‫ڄ‬ၲ૯
̟໳é௠‫ݵ‬ʿ঻૊֌Ϛέщશٜ
ʓçનգԅЉϚ˙୥Ꮓ༃ేণéᄺ
ʪ˾અၣӉᚺ௕έщၲ૯̟໳৾ሏ
Щѕ̳ቆዱéӍ݃бჟӍ‫ڄ‬ԇॐၰ
ᅭ᎝୕Ĭ
Which roughly translates to English as,
“I hope dat Hang-a-man does not resorta to
preurile jokes abouta my Chinese Heritage or
usesay Jackie Chan as my photo because it’s da
onry Chinese persons dat he know. “
H
it and Miss; My mantra,
my motto, my excuse for
tactless jokes. The great
thing about writing be-
hind a veil of anonym-
ity is that I receive direct uncensored
feedback about my articles. If there’s
one thing I’ve realised it’s that I simply
cannot please everyone. One person’s
cup of tea is another person’s cup of
coffee - and they hate coffee. Probably
one of those take-away coffees with the
tiny drinking holes in the lid. You can’t
sip, you can’t tentatively test the tem-
perature with your tongue, you have
no choice but to just go for it - AAAH
JESUS F***ING MOTHERF***ING
JESUS F***************C******** MY
TONGUE! WHO DETHIGNED
THETHE LIDTHS? - one of those
coffees.
I guess I could always use the
Marmite analogy, but after Jade Goody
described herself as Marmite, soiling
the brand and my favourite toast top-
ping, I decided I could never use the
word again. Fucking bitch
Anyway, seeing as it’s the final issue,
I thought I would do the good egotis-
tical thing of interviewing myself. It’s
probably because I find myself more
interesting than any of you.
Hangman: Hi hangman.
Hangman: You don’t have to say hi,
that’s just stupid. I thought we agreed
you wouldn’t do this. You’re embarrass-
ing me
Hangman: Do you enjoy writing
hangman?
Hangman: No. It’s about as enjoyable
as walking, and I don’t have the use of
my legs. Well I have the use of my legs,
but pretending that I don’t gets me a free
seat on the bus and the high-ground over
those fucking lazy pensioners who can’t
stand up. They shouldn’t be getting on a
bus if they can’t stand up.
Hangman: Could anyone write
hangman?
Hangman: Anyone with hands and a
basic grasp of the Engloosh language.
Actually just anyone with hands. You
know what, you could probably just
bash your head on the keyboard.
Hangman: Do you think anyone is
reading this interview?
Hangman: No. I’m already bored of
writing it.
Hangman: Which was your favourite
article you wrote this year?
Hangman: The Hitler interview be-
cause only I found it funny. I wrote it in
the style of a Celebrity interview from
a magazine.
It was meant to be picking on celeb-
rities, but people just saw the name
Hitler and went, ‘Ooooooh, jews, holo-
caust, that’s not cool etc’. I should point
out that his album, Wrong Turnz went
platinum in America last month and
he’s currently working on a song with
Lady Gaga called ‘ Rumourz hurt’.
Hangman: Do you admire any of
your fellow felix editors?
Hangman: I don’t so much admire, but
fear Gilead Amit. When he looks at you
in the eye, your brain feels like it’s melt-
ing from inferiority. When trying to en-
gage in an intellectual discussion with
him, I might as well just stick my tongue
out, drool and flap my arms about.
Hangman: And the others?
Hangman: All just trying to be Gilead.
Hangman: How do you go about
writing an article?
Hangman: I try to write dark high-
brow satire and then realise that I
can’t. I look at the blank canvas on the
computer screen and think, ‘this has so
much potential’, then ruin it. Imagine
first seeing your unborn child on an
ultra-sound screen and imagining all
the great things he’s going achieve in
life, then the doctor comes in and tells
you it’s a girl.
Hangman: How many complaints
have you had?
Hangman: To my disappointment, only
three. One about the Beginner’s guide
to the working class, one about the car-
toon of Jesus on a Cross, and my refer-
ence to the Cumbria shootings in Twat-
ter. No fatwas yet.
Hangman: Do you think you crossed
any lines?
Hangman: Osama crossed some lines,
but then he’s the founding leader of Al-
Qaeda so what do people expect? I’m
morally devoid, so I don’t believe in
lines.
Hangman: Do you worry about of-
fending people?
Hangman: I don’t set out to offend peo-
ple unless they’ve annoyed me. I try not
to be crude and tasteless unless I feel
it’s a necessity. While I try to remain
facetious, it sometimes just appears
flippant. I have to sit down and think,
how can I make people laugh? It’s not
like writing a review of a film or a play,
my one job is to make people laugh
and it’s a lot harder than people give it
credit for. A funny image or conversa-
tion sometimes just can’t be translated
to paper. If I worried about offending
people, I wouldn’t get anything writ-
ten. I stay away from Jew jokes though
because I’m scared of Gilead....he’s Jew-
ish.....or Palistinian.....one of them
Hangman: Will you be continuing
hangman next year?
Hangman: Sadly not because I’m not
going to be here. I may be able to con-
tinue Twatter by email, which is the
only thing people read anyway. I guess
this is my tearful goodbye....I’m meant
to say something like I’ll miss everyone
and that it’s been a pleasure.....I won’t
and it hasn’t.
Kadhim Shubber, the next Editor
“When people look at me they see a tall gangly
Iraqi in slim fit trousers and a bow-tie, but I’m
actually a - Oh no, that’s fine”
“Felix next year will be a fun and welcoming en-
vironment. I work on a strict, but fun deadline
policy and need all articles into the office by
Monday 4.00 AM. If you miss this deadline then
I won’t be angry, I’ll just be slightly annoyed, but
in a fun sort of way.I’ll be using the Guardian-
approved Smiley Face Chart™ and will award
a smiley face for every article handed in by the
deadline. Ten smiley faces and you win the cov-
eted Guardian-approved Kit Kat Chunky. Spell-
ing/grammatical errors, lack of enthusiasm, loss
of name badges, use of the name ‘Voldemort’, fat
thighs, or derogatory comments about the Smi-
ley Face Chart™ will earn you a sad face. Three
sad faces and you’re out, but in a fun way :).
