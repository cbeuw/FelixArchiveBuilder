It’s been a busy
year at the Union,
with a new
management
team, new
facilities, new
ideas and new
plans. At the
start of the year we appointed a new
Operations Manager and moved into
new offices on the second floor of the
Union building. Our amazing new spaces
for student activities were all open by
Christmas, providing additional large
rooms for students to shout and beat
each other with sticks, among other club
activities.
We hate paperwork as much as you do,
so we’ve tried to reduce the barriers
to running activities as part of Imperial
College Union – we’re great with clubs
but haven’t always supported smaller
groups of students doing good work
in the community. This is why we
introduced ‘Projects’, which are like
clubs but intended for small, short-term
student-run projects which benefit
society, whether locally, nationally or
globally.
The paint was barely dry on Phase 2 of
our refurbishment when Phase 3 kicked
off, as we secured £2.4m to replace our
tired bars and nightclub. The feedback
we’ve had about the project has come
from a broad range of students, and
we’ve listened to it all. It’s very clear that
we won’t be able to please everyone
though! I won’t be around when it opens,
but next year’s team will have an amazing
nightclub and bar. For the first time in
many years students will have direct
control over events which are held in their
nightclub, with student groups invited to
submit formal proposals and the elected
Ents Committee choosing which are
accepted.
As part of our drive to spend more
money on club activities and student
representation, we’re developing our
conferencing brand to make maximum

use of the building when students aren’t
using it. We’ve had to take the difficult
decision to cut funding this year, but hope
the plans we’ve put in place for the next
few years will allow that to be reversed
in future. We can’t expect funding from
central government and the College
to increase, so we have to exploit our
building and location to bring in external
money, while ensuring that students can
use our facilities when they need them.
Although lots of work has taken place
on commercial services and student
activities, we haven’t neglected our core
function: representation. This has always
been a less visible part of our work, as
people only notice it when things are
going wrong for them. For the first time
we provided training and a handbook
for student representatives and have
documented the rep system and how it
works.
Although we struggled at the start
of the year, we’ve devoted time to
postgraduate representation, embarking
on a project to identify and communicate
with postgraduate representatives who
previously received little or no assistance
from us (and many we didn’t even know
existed!) It’s only the start of bringing
postgraduate representation to the same
quality as our undergraduate system.
It’s not been plain sailing all the way, and
we haven’t achieved everything we set
out to do, but it’s certainly been exciting.
There’s been laughter and tears along the
way, but it’s been worth it. We wish next
year’s team the best of luck: there’s lots
for them to be getting on with!
P.S: Come and say hello (or rather
goodbye) to myself and the rest of the

– we’ll be enjoying the biggest line-up at
Imperial in decades!
