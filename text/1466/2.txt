His wife, Lady Rita O’Nions is
said to have expressed ‘dignified
delight’ at the news.
Shadow Chancellor Alistair
Darling has expressed his regret

INCOMING Felix Editor Ka-
dhim Shubber said he will be
the Buddha of Imperial College,
but will put aside his often criti-
cised religious beliefs next year.
In an interview with the Felix,
he promised never to get “irate
like a Chinese person” and will
strive to be “like Buddha, and
not like Ganesh” and keep calm
and peace within the office.
“I don’t want no extra arms,”
the devoted Hindu slurred.

EAGER final year biology
and biochemistry students
were horrified to find their
supervisors shredding their
dissertations.
Defending their decision the
academics said “It’s really sunny
outside so we can’t be arsed to
mark them.”
The scandal means that stu-
dents won’t be able to graduate
but several students said “Meh.
I didn’t have a job anyway. More
time at uni! Wooo!”

CONTROVERSY has erupt-
ed over the library’s decision
to ban students from playing
World of Warcraft.
The ban, effective immedi-
ately, was triggered by students
unhappy about the smell caused
by some WoW players who
spent days in the library with-
out washing.
One aggrieved player said
“They shall not defeat us. I’ve
beaten Orcs and Trolls. Puny li-
brarians are nothing. Nothing!”

THE UNION have found out the true
ingredients of the syrup used to serve
coca-cola to students.
For almost seven years, Union bar
management have been ordering both
cola and diet cola syrup on the cheap
from Thames Water company. In a cov-
ert bid to become the first five-star rated
water efficient borough in London,
the Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea have commissioned the use of
Thames river water in Imperial College
Union’s syrup supplies.
“We can assure you that the fourteen
corpses found in the Thames since the
syrup supply started in 2003 have had no
profound affect on its taste,” a borough
spokesperson added. “We told them to
add some sugar,” he added.
However, students have seemingly
never queried the odd taste.
“I’m generally too wankered to no-
tice. Thanks to the generous measures
of cheap diluted vodka, the taste of the
coke is pretty negligible,” one regular
m(p)unter said.
Scientists have warned of previously
unforeseen long-term effects coming to
light as students graduate and stop liv-
ing every minute of their dire social life
in the Union bar.
Indeed, several Imperial graduates,
almost all members of the Straight Edge
Society, have claimed a lack of sex drive
in the past year. They have all put it
down to ‘unadulterated’ pints of what
they describe as the “dishwater Cola”
from the Union.
“Since I came to Imperial, I just
couldn’t seem to pull anymore. Mem-
bers of the opposite sex didn’t seem at-
tractive to me. It must the cola,” once
disgruntled graduate told felix.
After vigorous scientific testing, the
cola ‘syrup’ has been shown to con-
tain over seven times the legal limit
of Fairy liquid in any publicly licensed
soft drink. This is in addition to dan-
gerous levels of the dysentery-caus-
ing bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae.
The bacteria, normally only found
in Western Africa, causes immediate
and explosive expulsion of gut content
either orally or anally. Again, busy/ig-
norant students failed to realise the
tell-tale signs of every-day dysentery.
“I knew I was throwing up, but I al-
waysjustthoughtitwastheevenmore
dangerous combination of Union
food and over-drinking the cheap
diluted vodka,” the Hockey club
member said, who admitted
to visiting the Union “at least
three times during the week
and four at the weekend.”
The Union falsified all
claims.
“We deny any knowledge
and refuse to believe we’re
serving dishwater to the stu-
dents. Though I always did
wonder why our order for
Calgon tablets was so con-
sistently high.”

Students flock to
Hyde Park birds
Feathers flew this week as the mass of Imperial students caught
rare sightings of ‘unfeathered birds’. After catching wind of the
London Naked Bike Ride, students rushed to neighbouring Hyde
Park where the annual event takes place.
Enraptured onlookers gasped in amazement at the riders’ cour-
age as they derobed for their 7 mile ride. One Imperial student
marvelled at the amazing site.
“I caught a glimpse of a nipple!” he exclaimed. “Yes, a real,
whole nipple... on a girl! I can die happy!” he continued.
The ride commenced from Hyde Park Corner, travelled through
the city, via Pervert’s Square and ended at the Tower of London.
Despite being a gloriously warm day, the majority of students
quickly dashed back indoors after the charity ride left Hyde Park,
claiming they “needed the toilet quickly.”
Medics to help scientists destroy their livers
Shubber ... a true gentleman of faith
Imperial College officials have with-
drawn all funding for the Imperial
College School of Medicine (ICSM)
and their Students’ Union (ICSM-
SU) in a move that is likely to anger
hordes of tipsy medics.
The decision arose with the report
of Salaries and High Income Trial-
ling (SHIT) that came about when
the Medics announced the holding of
wild and uncontrollable events such
as the ICSM Summer Ball and as one
official commented: ‘we need to rein
those bastards in. Doctors of tomor-
row? More like Biomedical Scientists
of next year.’’
With the Royal School of Mines
(RSM) now recognised as an official
union, Imperial commented that ‘we
couldn’t possible have more than
three faculty unions at one time’ and
mergers have been proposed to re-
flect this. With RSM leaving the
umbrella of the City and Guilds
College Union
(CGCU), the
situation re-
sults in two sep-
arate entities for
effectively similar
subjects, and
officials ex-
plained that
since ‘’Materials
and Geology are to
Engineering what Medicine is to Sci-
ence’’, the logical step would be to ‘’in-
clude all ICSM activities and subjects
under the much more prestigious, al-
beit sober, RCSU.
The Rector commented that ‘’them
pissing Miners in the RSM with their
nice building, always moaning. We
made some compromises in order
to make this work - and people will
look back and ask why the system was
changed. We will simply tell them, it
was the SHIT.’’
An election will be held to decide
the future name of this super-faculty,
with preliminary proposals including
Royal College of Science and Medi-
cine (RCSM) and Imperial College
School of Science and Medicine (IC-
SSM). The latter was met with criti-
cism due to its similarities and indi-
cation of the entire faculty of Science
deserving merely one letter.
“One f*cking letter? I’m, I mean,
we’re worth more than that,” retored
RCSU President Katya-yani Vyas
when she was told of the proposals.
Shared lectures between the RCSU
and ICSM namely in Biomedical
Science provide a cause for confu-
sion with regard to allegiance to a
specific faculty. The Department of
Computing (DoC) is an ideal exam-
ple of this, with
confusion aris-
ing as to whether
they’re Scientists
or Engineers.
“Am I a sci-
entist or
engineer?
Do I wear over-
alls or lab coats today?
FUCK IT, I can’t get dressed in the
morning with this harrassment,” a
2nd year Bioengineer said.
A spokesperson for the College fac-
ulty and staff who wishes to remain
anonymous due to the renowned
ICSM murders allegedly performed
to assassinate those threatening
its survival, says: ‘’they can keep
the debaucherous Reynolds Bar,
but we’ll want everything else.
All their fancy stethoscopes
and needles. YOU’RE NOT
JD AND YOU’RE NOT IN
SCRUBS. We get most of our
qualified doctors from Ma-
laysia and Iran anyway.’’ The
interview was prematurely
terminated, as was he.
“Seriously though, I can’t
be doing this anymore. I’ve
ended up coming into Col-
lege half naked most days,”
the disgruntled Bioengineer
butted in to say.
