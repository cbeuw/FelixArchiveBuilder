Have a good one!...
Well this is it, the last issue of term, so
to those of you who are staying in Lon-
don over the summer: there’s plenty to
do! The 5 events above are just random
ones I picked but there is so much more
to do - just getting out and having a look
will open some amazing opportunities!
Have a great summer, and watch this
space next term for more exciting
events!

Great British Beer Festival
– If you’re a beer fan, then this is the place
for you. Taking over Earls Court for the week,
the Festival sees a number of opportunities
to experience, well, beer, including the ‘Bot-
tled Beer Bar’ which offers more than 100 va-
rieties of real British ale in a bottle! So why
not come along this year and sample as many
of the 500+ different types of beer, cider and
perry that will be there, from golden ales,
stouts and bitters though to fruit beers and
even a couple of international guests!

6th July - 11th Sept
BBC Proms
– Unless you’ve been living in a hole the
past year, you’ll probably have heard
someone, somewhere, mention the BBC
Proms. But just in case you didn’t, the
Proms are an annual music festival taking
place mainly at the Royal Albert Hall (so
not too far away!) with over 70 fantastic
concerts, culminating in the most famous
event of the season - the “Last Night of
the Proms”

29th - 30th August
Notting Hill Carnival
– The Notting Hill Carnival is the largest festival of its
kind in Europe, as the streets of West London come
alive over the Bank Holiday weekend with the sounds
and smells of the Caribbean. Originally started by
the West Indian community of the Notting Hill area,
it has now become a full-blooded Caribbean carnival,
attracting millions of people from around the globe.
Twenty miles of vibrant colourful costumes surround
hundreds of Caribbean food stalls, over 40,000 volun-
teers and over 1 million Notting Hill Carnival revellers.
With many astonishing floats and the sounds of the
traditional steel drum bands, this may well be the most
fun you have all summer!
