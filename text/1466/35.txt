I
mperial College Union are to re-
vise the status and funding of a
number of IC sports teams be-
cause, as Felix editor Dan Wan
puts it, “they’re shit”. As part of
the continued effort to cut costs in the
current economic climate, and with
the status of university fees unsure, un-
ion officials as well as College bigwigs
have come to the decision that reduc-
ing funding, or removing it altogether
in the case of certain teams, is a viable
way of reducing expenses.
Spurred on by the fact that the Im-
perial College rugby 1sts were unable
to win varsity for the umpteenth year
in a row, finance hacks in the SAC
decided to take a closer look at other
shite teams wasting Imperial’s money.
It turned out that the felixSport league
table was of great help in this task, as
it was clearly obvious which teams ac-
tually set out to win matches and earn
BUCS points for Imperial and which
teams were simply in it for the wanton
post-match alcoholism and destruc-
tiveness (an unnamed source placed
great emphasis on the term “chunder-
monkeys”). Looking at the table shows
that most medics teams (bar rugby)
are useless, Imperial girls (admittedly
a small group) can’t play netball to save
their lives and rugby and hockey are
propping up both their league tables
and the union bar at the same time
(that’s an A for effort, then).
Of course, sport at university has
always been associated with a more
social, less competitive approach and
many students think it’s unfair to judge
teams based solely on sporting merit.
It would seem that the overzealous
bean-counters in Beit, Imperial lack-
eys through and through, focussed
on the more numerical side of things
rather than understanding how im-
portant it was to share a pint with
your mates after the match. Crushing
defeat or no crushing defeat, sport is
about more than just winning. As an
unnamed rugby fresher once said (or
tried to say, I could only half hear him
as his head was in a toilet): “the impor-
tant thing isn’t winning, it’s GETTING
SMASHED!” Beautiful stuff, worthy of
Pierre de Coubertin himself.
Interestingly enough, quite a few stu-
dents think the planned cuts are a good
move. Without wanting to generalise,
it is true that much of Imperial suffers
from a general, geeky apathy towards
sport. An anonymous Sci-Fi member
heartily agreed with the union’s mo-
tion, going as far as calling it “a bunch
of idiots running around and then get-
ting drunk” before letting out a sharp
hiss and retreating from the sunlight
back into the cool, dark confines of the
basement library in Beit quad. Oth-
ers, less extreme in their views, simply
bemoaned the way the raucous jocks
take over the union on Wednesdays
and Fridays, “downing Snakebites with
their ties around their heads after hav-
ing gotten hammered by some team in
Surrey”. Oh dear.
As a short-term measure, getting rid
of all the shit sports clubs who haven’t
won anything since the Conservatives
were last in power does seem like a
good option. A lot of money will be
freed up and the next ACC chair will
be able to concentrate on sorting out
the shambles left behind by his or her
predecessor, called the “worst ACC
chair in history” by some high-up ad-
min people (here’s to you, Chaz). Who
knows? Maybe if we focus on the good
stuff, Imperial will actually come off as
a decent sporting uni.
Actually, that’s not true. Imperial and
its geeky stalwarts are doomed to oc-
casional flashes of sporting brilliance,
but we’ll never dominate the country.
I know what we can do to win some-
thing, though. Scrap the entire ACC
and use all the money to build a huge
gaming-specific computer facility (or
give all the compscis a year of paid
leave to play WoW). We’ll have the
Left 4 Dead world championships in
the bag in no time at all.
Upon labouring through the laby-
rinth that is the Imperial College web-
site, felix uncovered news that the Dis-
cDoctors, less commonly known as the
Imperial College Ultimate Frisbee club
are just a signature away from realising
their dream of constructing a multi-
acre facility designed for the sole use of
participants in the plastic disc throw-
ing activity. Harlington, said to be of no
use now that no sport will be played is
leading location vying for the contract
to build this frisbee-dome.
They came against stiff competition
at the hands of Sam Furse, who after
the funding farce of last year, submitted
a bid to acquire the entire fleet of thor-
oughbreds from the UAE. He failed.
