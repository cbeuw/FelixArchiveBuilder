Mediterranean/Organic: Jak’s,
near South Ken station. I love the
food, the concept, the ambience,
the location. Not the cheapest
but competitive when compared
to Carluccio’s, Strada et al.
Modern European: Patterson’s,
near Oxford Circus station. Bit
pricey for students, so save it for
a special date or occasion. Great
rack of lamb, even better desserts.
French: La Ratatouille, near
Baker Street station. See above/
opposite..
Italian: Da Mario, Gloucester
Road. Sublime pasta dishes. Not
the cheapest, but I’d say it’s worth
it.
Pub: Queen’s Arms: I’m not a
gastropub expert, but the English
grub here is pretty sound.
Sushi: Yoshi Sushi, near
Ravenscourt Park station. Nobu-
quality sushi at a fraction of the
price.
Korean: Arang, near Piccadilly
Circus Station. Great food,
impeccable service. See opposite.
Cantonese: Four Seasons,
Bayswater. Top quality roast
duck. So good, it’s addictive.
Dim Sum: Imperial China, Lisle
Street (parallel to Gerrard St).
Quality dim sum, especially their
taro croquette and cha siu bao
(roast pork bun). Relaxed and
refined ambience.
Malaysian: Satay House, near
Edgware Road Station. As the
name suggests, divine satay.
Generally good Malay dishes,
including their Beef Rendang.
Iranian: Behesht, near Kensal
Green station. Ok, it’s quite far
from the realm of South Ken, but
more than worth the journey
for the intriguingly beautiful
restaurant, grilled baby lamb fillet
and naan (is this the best naan
I’ve ever tried?).
American/Ribs: Chicago Rib
Shack, Knightsbridge. Not the
cheapest, but worth it for their
baby back ribs, and also for a look
at their onion loaf.
Thai (Traditional Dishes): Thai
Taste, Cromwell Road. Classics
like pad thai and papaya salad,
grilled chicken and sticky rice
(kao mun som tam kai yang) are
excellent.
Thai (Modern): Addie’s Thai
Café, Earl’s Court. Try their
specials, especially their grilled
neck-end pork, and for a
refreshing hit, their Milky Way
Iced Tea.
Vietnamese: Song Que Café,
Shoreditch. Quite far from uni,
and you’ll need a reservation, but
believe me, this place is worth
it. Best pho in London, without
question. Also great banh xeo
(crispy crepe with prawns and
chicken, accompanied by herbs
and dipping sauce, nuoc cham).
Indian: Simply Indian, near
Borough station. Perhaps it’s a
surprise inclusion, but it is my
local, and their South Indian
dishes are quite stellar.
Turkish: Kazan City, near
Liverpool St Station. Quality
grilled meats. Entertaining front
of house. Surprisingly good
desserts, especially their baklava
with home-made rose ice cream.
Mexican: Chez Lalee, Kingston.
Again outside of the jurisdiction
of our college, but if you’re really
craving chilli con carne, this is
where you’ll want to go.
