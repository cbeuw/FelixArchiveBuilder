Well done to the winner of the final fe-
lix crossword this year. Sheryl you’ve
done us proud, and whilst there may
have been 50 points on offer, I may
have been a little enthusiastic. There
are no longer 50 points on offer, but
well done to all for managing to write
in. I hope you’ve enjoyed the cross-
words this year.
My thanks go to Peter Logg for his
time spent compiling them and to the
puzzles Captain Sean Farres for all his
hard work with the remainder of the
puzzles. Job well done lads and I hope
you carry on.

felix-o-scopes: Horoscopes, now with 100% more cat!
For those who rather fail their degrees whilst writing for/reading a pointless newspaper full of stupid cat puns
Cancer
Your hall is having its
farewell dinner on a
boat. You arrive to
find it’s painfully dull
and in an attempt
to alleviate your
boredom throw
yourself off the edge. A ninja cat with scuba
gear approaches you with a needle; you already
know what he’s got in store for you. The murky
Thames water tastes strangely like Union coca-
cola, mmm...
Virgo
It’s the end of the year,
and you’re reading
the last issue of felix.
You’re graduating,
and you’re not sure
how you’re going
to live without your weekly felix. You
draw small dartboards on your temples
and tie yourself to the felix office doors.
ONE-HUUUUNDRED-AND-EEEEIGGHTY!
Gemini
It’s time to move out
of halls and you’re
frantically looking for
a place. You consider
Watford but that’s not
really London now is
it? You’re viewing a place when the roof collapses
on you and your housemates. The neighborhood
cats ravage your bodies, sharing some acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome love with you.
Pisces
You’re at a picnic and
someone offers you
some salad. You refuse,
muttering, “It’s rabbit
feed. I need real food!”
Just then, the ground
begins to shake as a
giant-monster-rabbit appears. You timidly offer
it the salad. It turns it down, roaring, “IT’S SLUG
FEED! I NEED REAL FOOD!” and eats you
instead.
Leo
When I was a boy,
I asked my mother:
What will I be? Will I
be Watford or Luton
Town? This is what she
said to me:
Go wash your mouth out son, and get your father’s
gun, and SHOOT some LUTON SCUM! SHOOT
some LUTON SCUM! WE HATE LUTON! WE
HATE LUTON! WE HATE LUTON! WE HATE
LUTON!
Aries
Your parents take
you on a caravan
holiday in Wales.
You’d rather scratch
out your eyes with
rusty razors but they
still have those child-
locks on the car. On the first available sharp
corner, you throw yourself out the window and
land in a field of sheep. Mistaking you for a
local, the sheep turn nasty and pin you down.
They’ve been waiting a long time for revenge...
Scorpio
Yeh, yeh, so people
think you got into a
fight, got the Gaelic
football team to finish
your business. Well, it
didn’t happen that way,
did it? The guy you got confrontational with was
that much a dick he managed to piss off more
than just one person that night. He is a mega dick,
though. Rumours have it he was twatted by some
ginger bird too.
Libra
fank yoo to all ma
m8s out der. widout u
i wuldnt hv eva bcum
or savived being ferix
edita 4 sooooO long.
omgggg had u not
helpd out wid d

now. baaaares dpressin! anywayz babezzzz, luvs
ya all and dn’t dissapeer 4 too long, yeh? cum 4
bare wet n wild sex partys at jac, fil and mines.
Taurus
You take a girl back
to yours for dinner.
Afterwards, you’re
just laughing in the
kichen over a bottle
of wine. Suddenly,
the passion overtakes you and you start spoon-
ing like mad, with even some gentle forking. As
you get out your meat-knife, she stops you and
asks, “Can we stop playing with the cutlery and
just have sex?”
Capricorn
Graduating? Reading
your last ever
horoscope? Never
again will a dull Friday
morning be gleefully
swept away with our
darling nuggets of
inane comedy. Can we fit anymore words into
the previous sentence? You don’t care, it’s made
you smile. Yeh, we’re funny, and we’ve spread our
humour thinly like a guy who’s a bit ‘so-so’ about
Marmite on toast. One word left, really: Pint?
Aquarius
You’re at a theme
park, having a wild
time on all the rides.
In fact, the big roller-
coaster goes so fast
that you feel yourself
getting aroused. You finish the job and orgasm,
appropriately,atthetopoftheride.Youthinkyou’ve
got away with it but your cum-face is plastered all
over the souvenir photo stand. It looks like Piers
Morgan.

Sagittarius
All your friends are
graduating without you,
Look at them in their
gowns, thinking they’re
all that. A cut above,
blah blah. A cut above
your mum, mate. Who cares if you’re going to live
out the rest of your life eating pork pies alone?
Fuck it, your fat friend keeps eating all your pies
anyway.
