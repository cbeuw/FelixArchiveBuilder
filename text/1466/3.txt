UNION’S
DIRTY
RACIST!
Union President-elect, Alex Kendall has shocked several people, including passing
members of the public and a security guard, by unequivocally announcing his sup-
port for the British National Party last Wednesday evening.
NEXT YEAR’S PRESIDENT
VOWS LOYALTY TO BNP
A long-time Liberal Democrat supporter, he
formally proclaimed his backing in Beit Quad
this week. He claimed since coming into pow-
er, the Lib Dems had not stood up for his po-
litical beliefs.
“I am not drunk. Druuuunk I am not. Since
coming into power, the Lib Dems have not
stood up for my political beliefs,” he shouted
whilst precariously balancing on a wooden
bench. “Nick Clegg, he hasn’t a face I can
trust. Nick Griffin’s on the other hand, there’s
a face every mother in this glorrrrrrious na-
tion can loooove.”
The final year Biologist previously
spent a year working within a Lib Dem
office ‘researching for environmental
policies’ as part of his degree. He was
personally thanked by Nick Clegg after
his party sealed the coalition deal with
the Conservatives in May
“Young Alex provided me
with plenty of light re-
lief during periods of
extreme stress. His
under-the-table tac-
tics were just what
I needed during
some of those
more intense
moments.”
In an interview with felix, Kendall stated
that he will actively bring issues of national
political interest to his Presidency next year.
“I will actively bring issues of national po-
litical interest to my Presidency next year,”
he said. “This includes the BNP’s policy on
climate change. Despite studying it for the
past three years of my life, I can well and
truly say there isn’t any climate change.”
When questioned about one of his
Deputy Presidents, namely Ravi
Pall, being what he described as
“ethnic”, he took a hard line.
“I’m not against him being
here. Absolutely not, but I will use
surgical gloves with any email or
document he sends to my office.
He’s not allowed in my office, no,”
Kendall said. But what about
the German Deputy Presi-
dent (Education), Alex
Dahinten?
“Well, he can just fuck
off, can’t he?” stated an
adamant Kendall.

DAN has been impressed
this year by the CGCU news
website, Live!: “I really
appreciate how much time
the Editor puts aside for me
when thinks of new things to
haphazardly blame me for.
It’s a love-hate relationship.
And I’m the love half.”
