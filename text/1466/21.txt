Sort your journal library
with Papers for Mac

R
eading peer-reviewed jour-
nal articles is one of the most
crucial parts of studying sci-
ence. Whether you’re an un-
dergraduate trying to write a literature
review or a researcher trying to find a
new method, journals are the primary
way of sharing new information on
research topics with both specialists
and generalists. Most, if not all journal
articles are published online for down-
load in PDF format ahead of their print
debut. If you or your institution have
a subscription to the journal, or it’s an
open journal like the PLOS series, then
you can easily find and download the
article with PubMed or another peer-
reviewed journal index. Once you’ve
got the journal of course it’s a simple
matter of just loading up your PDF
reader of choice to read it. For one ar-
ticle that’s fine, but imagine you read
several articles a day and end up a li-
brary of journal articles totalling into
the hundreds, how do you keep them
organised?
Endnote by Thomson Scientific is
the current industry standard bibliog-
raphy program and it’s recently been
updated in the last few iterations to
support attaching PDFs to citations. If
you’re on a Windows PC, Endnote is
about as good as you can get, but those
on a Mac have a lot more choice.
Of course you can use Endnote on
the Mac, but it’s not a very ‘Mac-like’
experience. Mekentosj’s journal library
program Papers, is one great example
of a very Mac-like and effective piece
of software. It handles the download-
ing of citations and the articles asso-
ciated with them, lets you view and
edit the meta data of each paper, plus
Papers lets you read the article both in
preview and full screen reading mode
right from within the application. One
A
nother week has flown by
and we’ve reached the end
of another accademic year.
So, it’s with a heavy heart
I have to say, thanks for reading the
technology section of felix this year. It’s
been a year to remember and 2010 is
only just getting started.
In the computing space we’ve had
Google execs facing jail-time, as well
as big G’s move out of China due to
censorship. We’ve had the continual
battleground of processors move away
from the Intel Vs. AMD and into the
x86 Intel Vs. the ARM SOCs realm.
We’ve also seen Apple unveiling the
‘revolutionary’ iPad, which caught the
world by storm selling out in the US
to the detriment of launches in the
rest of the world. Who’d have thought
a $500 massive iPod touch would be
quite the success it has been, especially
Well this is it folks, felix is sign-
ing off for the year and so it’s
time to wrap-up the week’s
tech news one last time.
OnLive, the company that
promises console quality gam-
ing in your browser thanks
to the cloud, went online on
Thursday. Limited to just the
US for now, the service costs
$4.95 per month with an im-
pressive list of titles available to
play right now, including Mass
Effect 2, Assassin’s Creed 2 and
Dirt 2 amongst others. Not bad
for a service that could have
easily stayed vapour-ware.
Sticking with cloud ser-
vices, Google has added a ru-
dimentary video editor to it’s
YouTube service. While it’s
no iMovie, the editor lets you
cut, combine and crop video
content before upload. It’s fast,
simple to use and in the cloud,
what more could you want on
the go? iMovie on your iPhone
4 perhaps?
Cineworld this week also an-
nounced that it’ll be going all
digital projection within three
years. Converting all 77 of it’s
cinemas across the country
to pure digital is going to cost
Cineworld in the region of £40
million, including £10m the
chain has already pumped into
upgrading a third of it’s 790
screens. Going digital should
allow the cinema chain to re-
duce the price it pays for films
though a ‘Virtual Print Free’
deal with the studios, mean-
ing that the cost shouldn’t be
passed onto the customer.
The upgrade, done in partner-
ship with Arts Alliance Media,
will allow them to show sport,
plays, opera and other alterna-
tive content on the big screen.
Gone are the days of print and
reels, but is it truly better?
E3 had the gaming industry
buzzing this week, with un-
veils from Microsoft, Sony and
Nintendo taking prime spots.
First out of the gates was Mi-
crosoft showing off it’s new
Xbox 360 (that’s the 360 ‘slim’
to you and me) and it’s ‘Kinect’
motion sensing
gaming plat-
form, which was known by it’s
development name, Project
Natal. It’s going to be avail-
able come November for the
rumoured price of $150, whilst
the 360 slim hit these shores
on Wednesday for £199 sport-
ing a 250GB HDD and built-in
WiFi.
Sony, not to be out-
done by Microsoft,
unleashed their take
on the motion gam-
ing genera with the
PlayStation Move.
Scheduled for a Sep-
tember 19th release, Move
uses the PlayStation Eye and a
Move controller, which looks
like a black Wiimote with a
lolipop on the top. Whilst the
Move and Eye can be had in a
pack costing $99 with Sports
Champions, Sony’s version of
Wii Sports, the Navigational
controller is an extra $30. A
PS3 plus Move bundle will be
available at launch for $400.
Sony wasn’t done there
though, they also announced
that the PSN, Sony’s free on-
line gaming service, is getting
a paid add-on upgrade. Play-
Station Plus will cost $49 a
year and bring with it exclusive
DLC and other content, early
access to betas and demos,
auto-updating and free full
games to play, which’ll change
each month. Great for those
looking for a little bit extra
from the already solid PSN.
Last, but not least, we had
Nintendo with it’s latest 3D
iteration of the DS. Imagina-
tively named the 3DS, it comes
packing an impressive glasses
free 3.5” 3D widscreen, a 3D
effect slider, a motion sensor, a
gyro, a ‘slide pad’ joystick, two
cam-
eras
for 3D
photos
and im-
proved
graph-
ics.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed

of the killer features of Papers is the
ability to just drag and drop a PDF ar-
ticle into the program and it’ll do the
rest for you. Should the meta data in
the PDF not be good enough to iden-
tify a citation match, Papers will then
ask you to select or search from a cou-
ple of options for the correct citation.
Of course once you have your library
imported into Papers, which you can
do from Endnote amongst others,
searching it with Spotlight is a breeze,
by keyword, author, year or journal.
The searching doesn’t stop there as
Papers also lets you search PubMed
and a few other indexes directly from
the program. Organising your articles
in Papers is also incredibly easy to do
using drag and drop to simply move
articles into and out of folders or col-
lections. For instance if you happen
to have a particular project you’re re-
searching and a subset of your journal
library directly applies to it, you can
quickly and easily create a separate
folder in your library and sort your
downloaded articles in there.
Perhaps the thing that sets Papers
apart from all other journal library
managers is the ability to sync with an
iPhone and iPad app. Wirelessly sync-
ing your iDevice means you can take all
or a subset of your journal library with
you on the go for reading or reference.
Papers syncing goes both ways how-
ever, enabling you to search for, down-
load, read and modify the meta data of
journal articles on your iPhone then
sync them back to your Mac. A simply
fantastic feature if you happen to be at
a conference and someone mentions a
great paper you should check out.
There’s no doubt that Papers is a slick
and capable journal library organiser
and it has a lot of nice features, but it
lacks one crucial feature to make it the
be-all and end-all ‘iTunes for journals’
and that’s a cite-while-you-write func-
tion. Papers can’t itself insert citations
into your word processor of choice.
You can however export a library of
citations to your cite-while-you-write
engine of choice, be it Endnote or even
the reference manager built into Mi-
crosoft Word 2008. It’s not a bad solu-
tion, but Papers just begs to have it’s
own word processor citation engine,
and it means you can’t just rely on Pa-
pers to get your work done.
If you just want to organise and read
journal articles on your Mac or want
to take them with you on your iPhone,
then you can’t got far wrong with
Papers.
Costing €29 (about £25) from Me-
kentosj.com, Papers for Mac is also
available with 40% student discount.
Papers for iOS costs £8.99 and is avail-
able from the iTunes App Store.
Papers lets you catalogue, read and sync your journal article PDFs to your iPhone or iPad for reading on the go

in the economic downturn we all still
face. Perhaps we shouldn’t have put it
past Apple. It’s sheer desirability is the
envy of electronics manufatures the
world over. But of course Apple wasn’t
done with revolutionishing the tablet
computing space, oh no! The iPhone
4 launch is just round the corner and
already they’re out of pre-order units.
With FaceTime and slew of other evo-
lutionary improvements, Apple’s Jesus
phone looks likely to repeat it’s success
evermore.
But wait, we’ve also had a massive
expansion of Android in the mobile
space, with HTC and Dell churning
out some truly mind-boggling smart-
phones. Palm also, sadly, ceased to be
independent this year and we wait with
baited breath to see what HP has up it’s
sleeve for the father of the mobile com-
puting ecosystem.
