S
o it all comes to this, my
last column of my last felix.
And am I sad? A touch. Am
I happy to be leaving? Like-
wise, a touch. Spending four
years at Imperial College has been
hard; constant deadlines and woven
carefully with exams, at points, can get
you down. But the friendships created,
and times spend exploring new expe-
riences vastly outweigh any negatives.
University is supposed to be hard- and
we’re at one of the best establishments
in the country. Anyone who says that
they hate Imperial and wish they never
came are simply looking in the wrong
place. My university career has been
spent constantly attempting different
things, that once graduated, I’ll never
have the opportunity to do again. I’ve
done everything, in my mind, I’m
done, I’m off. There’s no point walking
over the same old ground.
I wish I had something chic or mo-
tivational to say, but all I want you to
take home is that your university is
what you make of it. Many of you will
be moving on into your second or third
years- second years will no longer be
the freshers, and third years will have
ultimate respect of adoring freshers.
It is up to you to ensure that the new
batch of freshers are welcomed in the
way that you wish to have been. You do
need to set an example. I myself only
stayed at Imperial in my first year due
to the Hockey Club, and particularly
to my hall senior Richard Bacon of the
quote, ‘university is about wrecking
your body for four years and spend-
ing the rest of your life recovering.’ I
concur. I hated my course, but had a
great time in the bar. True I was prone
to vomiting, falling asleep on Hux-
ley stairs and generally being a bit of
a mess, but that was then. Now I look
at the freshers getting over excited and
just think ‘they’ll tire out soon.’ But
that is the fixation of the Union, peo-
ple say that it’s shit- these people are
complete fucking morons. Now that
may just be my view, but the things we
are allowed to do and get away with
make it a very special place. You must
remember that the Union is run by stu-
dents- they know what you want, they
are one of you! The Union is there to
allow students to have fun doing what
they want- look at the new entertain-
ments committee, set up to allow stu-
Wordpath 1,466
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4
letter word from any 5+ letter word that contains
them both.
e.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)
Noconsecutivestepsmaybemadebythesamemethod.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)
would be invalid.
Earliest, SHORTEST, valid path between the
two words wins. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Solutions may be submitted for
confirmation (see FUCWIT section for details).

dents to host their own club nights. To
further that I saw a post on the phase
3 blog which said the new bar looked
‘like a place you might get kicked out
of if you were hammered.’ The fact that
we don’t is a testament of the Union’s
view that it’s a place where people will
start to learn their limits. They’d much
rather people ascertain said limits in
a safe environment, where if they do
fuck up, then they won’t end up with
the Police. That’s just the bars, I’m
not starting with the clubs or support
on offer. I think I’m wandering, in a
nutshell, don’t blight the vision of the
freshers.
People always say that ‘it just seems
like yesterday...’ and unfortunately, it’s
no different for me. I remember the
Saturday I arrived, just as well as I re-
member the following day, sitting in
A&E with blood pouring from my head
due to my poor ice skating technique.
Enjoy your time here, it will pass you by.
In my final few words, I want to talk
about friendships. University is a try-
ing time, and at times you need your
mates to give you the helping hand you
so desire. You’ll meet many new peo-
ple, and simultaneously, you’ll grow
distant to some. The precious few will
remain, the ones which you spent the
best part of your social time with, and
the ones who feature most heavily in
your stories. I write this, not with a tear
in my eye, but a definite sadness as I
realise that I will be leaving behind so
many classmates that I’ve relied upon.
Some new, some old, but all I want to
see again. I think that’s the same for
all grandaunts, and hopefully you. So

Ah, the final issue at last and it’s all
over. I will be let out of the felix office
after this issue is distributed and will
learn what ‘sun’ means. I do not yet
know whether or not I will return next
year but it has been fun making puz-
zles for you guys and chatting to those
of you who were talkative in your sub-
mission emails. To keep my promise, I
have returned Nonogram for you this
week. Have a good holiday everyone!
