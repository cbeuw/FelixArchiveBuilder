Nonogram 1,466
How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
e.g. 3 5 (in a row 10 cells long) could mean:
or
or
Hence it is immediately determinable that the
following cells can be shaded:
In a similar manner it is possible to identify definite
spaces (here represented as Os).
As you may have noticed some shaded cells and
definite spaces have been provided for you in
the grid. These particular cells have 180degree
symmetry with other cells in the grid. However the
complete solution does not, so it’s recommended
you fill in the corresponding cells before you begin.

contributor and nonogrammed by the Puzzle
Captain. Solutions can be submitted for
confirmation until midday next Friday.
Yesterday, I met five members of the orchestra in the bar, and
spoke to them for quite a while. When I got home, my memory, for
some reason, was a bit hazy.
I met them again today.
‘Would I be right if I said that John plays the trombone, Katy plays
the violin, Louise plays the oboe, Mike plays the clarinet and Nigel
plays the cello?’
‘No,’ they said, ‘but you’ve remembered our names correctly, and
our instruments.’
‘In that case, would I be right if I said that John plays the violin,
Katy plays the oboe, Louise plays the clarinet, Mike plays the
trombone and Nigel plays the cello?’
‘That’s closer, but not right.’
‘Would I be right if I said that John plays the oboe, Katy plays the
cello, Louise plays the clarinet, Mike plays the violin and Nigel
plays the trombone?’
That’s closer still, but not right. Louise doesn’t play the clarinet or
the cello.’
Who plays what?

Slitherlink 1,466
How to play:
The numbers in
the cells represent
how many lines
surround it. Draw
a single continuous
line in the grid
that satisfies all
the numbers, does
not cross itself and
forms a closed loop.
Beginner Tips:
Every node may
only have 0 or 2
lines connecting
to it (it’s part of
the loop or it isn’t).
Place a small mark
between nodes that
cannot connect.
To the right is a puzzle designed by
1983/1984 felix’s very own Puzzle God
(not actual title), Ulysses.
Below is a puzzle that was submitted to
him by a maths fresher, Neil Thornton,
in the subsequent issue.
