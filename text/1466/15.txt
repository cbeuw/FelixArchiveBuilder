W
ell it’s been a inter-
esting experience
being Film Editor
this year, a position
I somehow fell into
and I’ve just about managed to keep the
page running. Of course my job would
have been much harder if it wasn’t for
the regular quality contributions I was
sent. I want to especially thank Jade
Hoffman, Stefan Zeeman and John
Park for their brilliant reviews and I
apologise for any butchering I might
have done to them.
We are very fortunate to live in
London but I am first to admit that
I haven’t taken full advantage of the
wealth of cinema available to us. I can
blame the inconveniences and stress
of my busy Imperial timetable, but I
know that most of the time I am too
lazy to trek all the way to the East End
to watch an inconspicuous independ-
ent film limited in its release to one
cinema. It’s hypocritical of me to rant
about illegal movie downloads hurting
the film industry when I’m content to
languish on my bed and watch a piss
poor quality version of Shrek 4 online.
But when I have been bothered to
watch something different, I have been
thoroughly rewarded. The highlight of
the year for me was Love Exposure, a
four hour long Japanese Indie film that
was incredibly mental but insanely
good. The only cinema in the whole
country screening it was the ICA (In-
stitute of Contemporary Arts) and so I
thought it was a too good a chance to
miss. There are plenty of big cinemas
in London to watch mainstream re-
leases and a wonderful array of smaller
‘arthouse’ and independent cinemas
like the BFI and Curzon theatres to
watch little known gems.
Critics deplore at the lack of quality
of films these days but we are in fact
witnessing a silent revolution in cin-
ema that most people are unaware is
happening, and it all started with The
Blair Witch Project. Traditionally, films
are very expensive to make as cameras,
tape and development are not cheap.
Hollywood films would look profes-
sional and glossy and independent
films would instead look shabby.
However, the advent of the digital
camera has allowed quality films to
be made on a low budget, The Blair
Witch Project was originally shot for
about $25,000 but went on to make
$248,639,099. Suddenly movie studios
and investors were intrigued by the
potential of low budget films. Over the
last decade, the quality and sophistica-
tion of digital technology has improved
so much that now anyone with a few
thousand pounds and some computer
software can compete for the Oscars.
As Hollywood pushes towards 3D to
keep punters returning to the cinemas,
novice directors are emerging to pro-
vide us will interesting films that push
the boundaries of style and taste. I be-
lieve the critics are wrong, if they look
past commercial cinema then they
would see a huge ocean of creative tal-
ent that is getting larger everyday.
That is why we are so privileged to
live in London where all the blockbust-
ers, homegrown ‘indies’ and World
Cinema are available to watch with a
little bit of effort and an Oyster card.
It’s a delight watching films and just as
enjoyable reviewing them. If you have
always wanted to submit a film review
but haven’t found time, don’t hesitate
to do so next year!

In a felix exclusive, we divulge all the information on the planned
Roman Polanski directed musical biography about Josef Fritzl
I
n a recent interview, Roman Po-
lanksi revealed his plans for his
new project. Due to the contro-
versial topic of the film’s subject,
Fritzl! has been shrouded in
secrecy but using all the journalistic
techniques at my disposal, I have man-
aged to gather some interesting de-
tails. If you haven’t heard of Josef Fritzl
then you have probably been locked
in a basement for the past twenty four
years.
As Polanski is twiddling his thumbs
under Swiss house arrest, it was too
difficult to contact him however, I
have received information from other
undisclosed sources. The film is de-
scribed as a sequel to The Sound of
Music with a working title of The Von
Trapped Family. According to the
film’s producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, the
plot will explore the Austrian tradition
of teaching their children about sex by
Kevin Spacey Josef Fritzl
keeping them in the dark. “We will also
have plenty of explosions and an excit-
ing finale where Fritzl transforms into
a twenty foot robot to avoid arrest.”
Bruckheimer is reported as saying.
Michael Bay was first choice to direct
but his schedule clashed with plans
to make a documentary on the BP
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, where
government scientists race to pre-
vent the oil slick from taking over the
world. Bay is described as being ‘gut-
ted’ for missing the opportunity to
direct the Fritzl film. David Lynch
was approached as well to direct but
he was soon dropped for insisting
that Fritzl was replaced by possessed
Siamese twins and the film to be set in
a ‘Minoan parrallel universe’ instead of
Austria.
Bruckheimer is happy that Polanski
has enough experience with under-
age girls to handle the film’s sensitive
topic. Dakota Fanning is speculated to
have been cast as the daughter Eliza-
beth Fritzl. After inquiring about the
risqué scenes involving her character,
Dakota stated that “it can’t be worse
than spending two months with Tom
Cruise on the set of War of the Worlds”.
The only other role to have been
cast so far is that of Josef Fritzl himself
who will be performed by the double
Academy Award winning actor Kevin
Spacey. “Kevin jumped at the oppor-
tunity to play Fritzl”, said a delighted
Polanski, “he is perfect for the part,
there is no other actor who could fill
that man’s shoes”. Daniel Day Lewis
was another contender for the part but
his plan to do it ‘method’ and start his
own family with his daughter in a dun-
geon proved unfavourable due to time
constraints.
Andrew Lloyd Webber will write and
score the music and songs including
‘There is no escaping while I am raping
under the floor!’ Another song will de-
scribe a neighbours amazement at liv-
ing next door to Fritzl’s daughter. “For
the past twenty four years I’ve been liv-
ing next door to Alice. Alice, who the
fuck is Alice?” This film will not be re-
leased in the foreseeable future.
The set is projected to be cheap
The most highly anticipated films at the Edinburgh International Film Festival
The Illusionist Jackboots on Whitehall Superhero Me
Get Low
The Illusionist is the talk of the
town in Edinburgh at the moment.
It is a melancholic adaptation of a
Jaques Tati story brought to life by
the brilliant animation of Sylvain
Chomet (The Belleville Rendevous)
In this highly explosive alternative
history, the Nazi’s have invaded
Britain and it’s up to the Scots
to form a resistance and rescue
Winston Churchill. It looks
fantastically barmy with Ewan
McGregor donating his voice to
a cast of ridiculous
looking puppets.
Robert Duvall stars as a mean
hermit who decides to throw a
funeral party for himself whilst
he’s still alive. Bill Murray helps
the old man out whilst trying
to understand why he’s been
shooting everyone who’s come
near him over the years.
Join filmmaker Steve Sale on his
quest to become the costumed
crusader SOS and keep
the mean streets of Sutton
and Epsom clean of
crime. This looks
like a entertaining
comic documentary
of the real Kick Ass.
Steve enlists the help
of comic book geeks,
martial arts instructors
and other real life
superheroes (they
exist) in his mission to
become a legend.
