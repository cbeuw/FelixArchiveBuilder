Editorial Comment
Once again the editor of F e l i x
ia under f i r e . T
rom a l l quarters,
I.C. Union, I.C. Council, the Marxist
group and the student populus i n
general, guns have been aimed my way.
The unfortunate cause of these volley's
has been the anonymous a r t i c l e printed
in the last e d i t i o n under the name of
"Commentary".
I have always had a great b e l i e f
in the idea of the freedom of the press.
I also f e e l that " F e l i x " 3houlc be i n
a p o s i t i o n $o publish the considered
opinions of a l l students, but freedom
of opinion should not be allowed to get
so much out of hand that slanaer i s a l l -
owed to creep i n . Perhaps i n the
case of "commentary" t h i s has been
allowed to take place, and as a natural
consequence many people have been
offended. To these people I should
l i k e to o f f e r my most sincere apology.
My only excuse f o r the error now i s
that i t may have jolted some people out
of their apathy toward Union A f f a i r s .
A s i t u a t i o n , which I f e e l our
anonymous author i s quite i n place to
mention.
You w i l l notice that this weeks
copy of F e l i x c a r r i e s no edition of
"commentary". This i s because the
writer, (whoever he or she i s ) has
either l e f t the country, hibernated,
run out of ink or i s just plain
scared. I f so, I hope that the
controversy w i l l make him a l l the more
anxious to express h i s opinions.
I w r i t e t h i s a r t i c l e a i t t i n g back
in the Upper Lounge of the Union,
knowing very happily, that as t h i s i s
the l a s t e d i t i o n of F e l i x t h i s term i t
w i l l not be possible f o r any would be
"Cassandra" to r u i n my Christmas
Dinner, and i n t h i s mood I should l i k e
to take my leave of you f o r t h i s term
and year, wishing you, on behalf of
myself and the whole e d i t o r i a l s t a f f
a very Happy Christmas.

PRESIDENT SPEAKS
Lear S i r ,
I would l i k e publicly to lodge a
complaint against certain of your
actions as Editor of 'Felix" i n the
last issue.
An anonymous commentary on union
a f f a i r s was published, which, although
grossly inaccurate f a c t u a l l y , and c h i l d -
ish i n i t s iaeas, was answered by my-
self i n an a r t i c l e that was not printed.
You lacked, o i r , the courage to t e l l me
that my answer was not to be published,
and led me to believe that i t would.be.
It was not u n t i l the day of issue that
I found that the a r t i c l e had been l e f t
out. However, the real complaint I
have i s that i t was agreed long ago
that when any individual, (or i n d i v i d -
uals) was attacked i n 'Felix", he should
have the opportunity to reply i n the
same issue.
I t i s Sir,your anonymous contrib-
utor's r i g h t , provided he i s a member of
the Union, to write what he sees f i t
concerning Union a f f a i r s , and with
that I have no complaint. . might
have hoped, though, that an Editor whose
E d i t o r i a l pleaded f o r the University
outlook would r e a l i s e that free speech
was a prerequisite of such an outlook,
which means a l l points of view being
put.
May I i n closing r e f e r to two of
the statements i n the offending
commentary.
F i r s t l y , the Union meeting was not
inquorate. and secondly, Council made a
recommendation to the union meeting con-
cerning the Carnival proceeds. The
Union then came to a decision. This i s , ,
I believe, an i n f i n i t e l y better arrang-
ement than Council making a decision and
scarcely bothering to t e l l the Union.
Yours sincerely,
Lea Allen.
President, I.C.U.
CLOTH CAPS
Dear S i r ,
Although I usually f i n d " F e l i x "
enjoyable to read and r e l i a b l e i n i t s
f a c t s , I was h o r r i f i e d and deeply grieved
to read the opening paragraph of "The
Flay1
s the Thing". The description of
England's greatest county was t y p i c a l
of that uninformed view held by the
bowler hatted, umbrella carrying members
of the sprawling suburbia that stretches
from the" south coast to Birmingham.
For tho3e who would discover the
truth about " c l o t h caps", I l k l a ' Moor,
Gordale Scar (which i s i n the limestone
area of the dales), the 3ronte country,
and the other a t t r a c t i o n s of this county,
may I recommend the I.C.I.H.G. Easter
vacation tours. In faot anyone who i s
interested i n seeing the countryside by
walking, canoeing or c y c l i n g next Easter
should look at the "Youth Hostel Group"
notice board by the concert h a i l NOW as
bookings have to be made early f o r the
more popular areas.
Yours etc.,
Roger M. Henson.
MARXISM REPLIES
Dear S i r ,
I am somewhat distressed Dy the tons
used by the author of the "Commentary"
i n your l a s t issue, with regard to
the Marxist subt-group of the L i t a r a r y
and Debating Society. He states that
the group are an embarrassment not
only to the Sooiety but to the Union as
a whole, and should therefore not be
o f i c i a l l y recognised i n any way. This
point of view seems to be symptomatic
of an intolerance which i s only too
common i n t h i s country, an i n t o l e r -
ance towards any point of view that
i s not considered "respectable".
London University i s the home of
an vigorous an atmosphere of s e l f -
expression a3 can be found anywhere i n
the world. R a c i a l , r e l i g i o u s or
p o l i t i c a l intolerance i s almost non-
axistsnt, and, f a r from being an embâ€”
arassment, the presence of extreme
elements i s considered a source of pride,
an i n d i c a t i o n of the d i v e r s i t y of opin-
ion among students and of t h e i r zeal f o r
expressing i t . Thus i t i s a sad thing
that the L i t a r a r y and Debating Society
whose very existence hinges on the f r e e -
dom of opinion, should f e e l i t s e l f com-
pelled to disown the Marxist group.
I t may be argued that the Marxists
advocate a system of government that does
not allow personal l i b e r t y . To my mind
t h i s i s irrelevant. Extremist groups
have no chance of t h r i v i n g except i n a
society that i s fundamentally rotten.
The spread.of intolerance and u l t r a -
conformity can only help such a s i t -
uation to come about.
Yours sincerely,
I.N. Guy
Dear S i r ,
I should l i k e to point out that the
remarks concerning the proposed Marxist
Forum, i n the anonymous commentary i n
the l a s t issue of " F e l i x " were t o t a l l y
incorrect. Far from attempting to
form the Society i l l e g a l l y the w r i t e r
surely knows tnat we have over f u l -
f i l l e d the constitutional requirements
just as we did four years ago when we
were refused permission to become a
f u l l society.
The w r i t e r reveals the reason f o r
these smears when appealing f o r our
Sooiety not to be recognised i n any form.
Possibly the embarrassment he or she
writes of, i s due to h i s or her own
embarassment at any group of people
being prepared t o speak t h e i r minds
openly.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Judy Cox.
(for proposed Marxist Forum}
Dear S i r ,
In the l a s t issue of " F e l i x " , vou
make wbat I can only describe a petty
attack upon the Marxist Sub-group, under
the plea that i t i s an "embarrassment"
to the I.C. Union. How t h i s comes about
we are not * o i d , the reason obviously
being that your accusations are f a l s e .
Since i n the 3ame issue we are
regaled with an a r t i c l e upon the lack
of p o l i t i c a l freedom i n South A f r i c a ,
one cannot but wonder at the philosophy
of one who would deny the 3ame freedom
at home, wit .in his own College.
Perhaps he r e a l l y prefers the p o l i c i e s
of Iir. Irving, and may v i o l a t e the freed-
om of the press by not p r i n t i n g t h i s
letter..
Yours disgustedly,
P.J. Roberts (Fred)
