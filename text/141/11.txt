FELIX
SQUASH
At the Clubs general meeting on 30th
November the main item discussed was the
expansion programme and i t s effect on our
Squash Courts, Professor Sparkes, who
took the onair gave a run. picture or the
situation. It aprears that at the mo-
ment there, are no plans for any Squash
Courts at Imperial College. The meet-
ing agreed to the motion that a suitable
letter on this matter be sent to the
Reotor at onoe.
Ihe draw for the Whitley Cup is now
posted in the Squash "Courts. As there
are exams at the beginning of next term,
the f i r s t and second rounds should be
played by the term. Next Monday
evening and Wednesday afternoon have been
reserved by the Club for Whitley Cup
matches.
The 1st V suffered another heavy de-
feat 0 - 5 , this time by Clare College,
Cambridge. Will my match secretary
pleaae put the Carnival dates into his
diary. However, we won away against
University College, thanks to a fine
effort by ex-hockey player Robin Jowit,
who beat U.C.'s Captain 3 - 1 .
The 2nd V lost a good looking
record last Wednesday when they met youth
in the form of fipsom College and a J-5
defeat. In their present state I don't
think the 1 s t V would have done any be
better but they have got the fixture in
the future.

Hockey
I.C.W.S.C. have failed to win this
term, and i t has, as usual, been d i f f i -
cult to raise a team. However in the
matches we have rlayea i t has been
obvious that the excellent,defence has
not been backed up by the forward line.
Chris Braziel and Margit Zakarious
deserve particular mention as they have
both done a great deal to raise the
general standard of play. Chris, of
course, plays for U.L. with Hilary
Tompsett. It i s hoped that Capt. Ann
Hodnett has better luck with her team
next term.
Netball
Chelsea Poly, can almost be rated
as our "home ground" now. The team
plays regularly down at Manresa Road,
and we have had several close and
exciting matches there.
It was obvious in our last game
that most of the team had been watching
I.C. Rugby Club, and several Chelsea
girls seemed to be in danger of their
lives. However they survived and lived
to enjoy a very pleasant evening in I.C.
Union.
Squash
The squash team is undefeated this
term, and they chalked up a very fine
win over U.C. first team. A notable
addition to the Club i s Brenda Whyte,
a U.L. player, Katie can look forward
to captaining an experienced team in
their matches next term.
BASKETBALL
The London Basketball League i s
accepted as the finest selection of
teams in the country and with an exten-
sive programme of netball as well as
basketball matches, the I.C. team
began to wonder whether or not they had
bitten off more than they could chewl
The f i r s t game showed us that the
standard of play waa a great deal higher
than the University League and, although
we defeated Chelsea Central by 4 4 - 2 2 ,
i t was not quite as easy aa the score
might indicate. Pinsbury Park provided
even stiffer opposition and i t took the
I.C. team quite a while to settle down
to their usual game. It was not
until the seoond half that we finally
got on top to win by 53 - 4 5 .
With these two olose matches be-
hind us we then proceeded to hand out
thrashings to Borough itoad, Huntingfield,
and Kingston I.M.C.A. A l l these eames
showed that the basketball team, like
many other IC teams, are very slow at
starting and i t was only by good seoond
"half play that the results are so good.
The record to date was then played 5
won 5, hut the next game brought us up
against Central Y.M.C.A. who were tipped
to win the league this year. Playing
at Central, one of the most spacious
gyms in the country, i t took longer than
usual for the I.C. team to aettle into
their regular play and by that time
Central has almost taken command of the
game. However the I.C. team pressed
hard and with defensive man Hind out-
atanding in attack (his variations of
speed and thrust left the Central tean
leader rootedl) oaptain Mike Barron,
scored some'outstanding long shots so
that at half time we lagged by only
one point. A change of tactics by
the Central team in the second half
resulted in the I.C. team being
pegged down, and the Central score
began to mount. It was soon realised
that although their tactics meant
that set shots were out, some fine
passing movements resulted in a dramatic
reversal in the direction of the play.
I.C. overbawled Central and with five
minutes left held a lead of 3 points.
Not deterred in any way Central
fought back and managed to reduce the
arrears,,but we held on and finally won
by 39 - 3 5 , a very commendable result,
which puts us at the top of the division.
Interspersed with these games we
played five others in the University
of London League, with only one" defeat.
The last two matches are worthy of
mention, not only because they were vic-
torious, but because during the latter
half of the f i r s t and the whole of
the second, the I.C. team played the
beat that they have ever played. The
team make up has changed l i t t l e since
last year, the only notable addition
being Mat Mathews who, in spite of his
lack of inches, has scored many points.
Last year's captain, Jack Fryer,
was not the prolific scorer of last
season, but instead has played the part
of pass feeder to the rest of the team.

BADMINTON
I am happy to report that the club
has continued i t s run of success since
the last issue of this revered news-
paper. The second team has had two
interesting and closely fought matches,
against Kings and the London Hospital
Medical School both of whioh we won
by the narrowest of margins , 5 rubbers
to 4 .
We almost had to play the Hospital
game with a 2 pair team,the sixth
member arrived very belatedly after
what must have been a record breaking
dash from Clapham to Whitechapel.
This could have been avoided i f the peo-
ple selected both to play and to aot as
reserves had kept a close eye on the
Notice Board and crossed or ticked
off at the appropriate time.
The Aings game, as always, was a
closely fought affair in wnich our
second pair did very well to win a l l
three rubbers. The f i r s t pair played
probably their best match of badminton
of the season and after winning two rub-
bers conceded the final one, against
Kings l s t pair, after a very even game.
The mixed side has won both of i t s
games in the last fortnight and i s
functioning much better as a team than
i t did last season. As always the
three men are at least as good as the
opposition. The difference lies in the
fact that our ladies are now more exp-
erienced^), and are not overawed by
the fact that they are playing in a
match.
Dare I say that this may be the
reason for the re-ascent of our badmin-
ton teams to their rightful place at
the top of the leagues, where they have
not been for some l i t t l e time now.
HOCKEY
I.e. 7 L.S.E. 2
This score indicates the run of
play in this 2nd round of the U.L. cup,
the I.C. forwards always pressing and
the occasional defensive error.
The match started off true cup style
with both teams fighting for the ball,
each trying to draw f i r s t blood. It
soon became apparent that the lively I.C.
forwards had the edge over a oumbersome
L.S.E. defence, and I.C. were awarded
a penalty bully for a kick on the goal-
line, which Bhatragar converted.
However, L.S.E. soon equalised with
a goal from their left; this was unfortunate
since the ball was kicked into the I.C.
circle.
The turning point of the match came
when I.C. scored 3 goals in 15 minutes.
First DeBrookert scored a magnificent
goal from the back of the circle with
a shot which rocketed into the top of
the net. Then Miller pushed the ball
in during a goalmouth scramble. And
again DeBrockert scored with a nicely
angled shot from the right.
In the second half, i t was apparent
that i t was only a matter of time with
I.C. pressing hard and the L.S.E. defence
hitting out. I.C. asserted their suprem-
acy with 2 goals scored by the presi3tent
King and I goal by lowell the I.C. centre
half.
The L.S.E. centre forward, their
outstanding player, scored a consolation
goal to make the final score.
I.C. 7 L.S.E. .

Although I.C. are to be congratulated
on once again reaching the semi-final,
the missed chances of this match must
be goals scored against stronger
opposition.
