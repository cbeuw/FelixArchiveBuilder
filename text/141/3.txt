CALUS TORRBE
Our (learned) editor i n his cor.ment
of the l a s t issue mentioned the
appalling lack of culture i n the
general I.C. students. As non-
technical reading i s considered to aid
a f u l l education, t h i s book column has
been formed.
' L o l i t a , l i g h t of my l i f e , f i r e of
my loins. My s i n , my soul.
Lo-lee-ta: the t i p of the tongue taking
a t r i p of three steps down the palate
to tap at three on the teeth.
Lo. Lee. l a . '
So begins the most disoussed and
certainly most interesting book of the
year. LOLITA by VLADIMIR NABOKOV,
price 21/-.
I t i s the story of Humbert Humbert,
a man obaessed with an unusually strong
desire f o r 'nymphets1
. His d e f i n i t i o n
of t h i s term takes up f i v e pages
(ardent indeed) but can be given
roughly as a g i r l c h i l d between the
ages of nine and fourteen of f e l i n e
cheekbone and downy limb.
The book, written biographically
(though e n t i r e l y f i c t i t i o u s ) , starts
with H.H.'s early l i f e before he f i n d s
L o l i t a ; a l i f e of f r u s t r a t i o n and
d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n with his wife, whom he
later divorces. His emotions and
thoughts are introduced, remaining the
dominant feature throughout, giving a
picture of a taut nervous character
After separation he wanders aimlessly
t i l l his chance meeting with L o l i t a .
She i s the daughter of a widow, who
rents a room to eager Humbert. Pate
takes a hand as mother Haze f a i l s i n
love with her lodger and, of course, he
accepts marriage, g i v i n g him the
opportunity to f a t h e r rosebud L o l i t a .
Mrs. Haze shortly a f t e r the wedding
i s aeoidently run down and k i l l e d by
a oar leaving Humbert s o l e l y responsible
for Lo. What oould be better than to
take her f o r a r e s t f u l tour of the country?
Needless to say she becomes his mistress
in a very short time. Humbert then
developsa into a man with a f a n a t i c a l
jealousy and anxiety neurosis,
experiencing a f r u s t r a t i o n which he
finds oannot be s a t i s f i e d . F i n a l l y ,
when he loses Lo, he reaches the edge
of insanity, commits murder and i s
arrested.
The author, Vladimir Nabokov, was
born i n Russia of a r i s t o c r a t i c parents
at a time of general unrest. He became
a refugee at the outbreak of the
revolution and l i v e d i n France, then
Germany, f o r some years. In 1940 he
emigrated to America where he remains.
Anyone reading this novel f o r i t s
pornographic worth ( i f that i s not contra-
dictory) would be completely disappointed.
Pornography must take the reader from one
sexual scene to another with the bridging,
providing the necessary sequence to the
story, as small as possible otherwise
he w i l l lose patience. Only the sexual•
passions should be aroused. Tuis i s
obviously not the case with L o l i t a .
The sensual scenes play only a minor
part, inoluded to i l l u s t r a t e Humbert's
state of mind. I t was not the obscene
nature of the book that h o r r i f i e d the
publishers but the theme of a middle-
aged man having a twelve year old mistress.
As i s stated i n the Foreword "offensive"
is often just a synonym f o r "unusual".
Certainly i t i s the l a t t e r . "
FELIX
But whatever i s said, L o l i t a i s a
booic whioh should not be ignored. I t ' s
style i s l i v e l y , d e l i g h t f u l and outspoken.
The i n f i n i t e moods and situations of
Humbert are produced v i v i d l y , reminiscent
of Proust, giving the reader a complete
picture of this complex character.
The place names are also a pleasure to
read: Insomnia Lodge, Grimm Road, and
many other such Joycean word plays.
The analogies of h i s work with
Kafka, Proust and Joyce, however, do not
r e t r a c t from Nabokov's o r i g i n a l s t y l e
and b r i l l i a n c e i n w r i t i n g and the
obvious merit of hia work.
He has spoken English and Russian a l l
his l i f e due to his English governess
and has studied f o r a degree at
Cambridge. His command of both
languages i s i l l u s t r a t e d by his many
books. He has written eight novels i n
Russian and three i n English. He has
also published English and French
translations of Russian poets and
o r i g i n a l poetry i n English. His move
to America has caused him to evolve a
v i v i d English s t y l e of i n t e r n a t i o n a l
acclaim. He teaches and i s an ardent
b u t t e r f l y c o l l e c t o r i n his spare time.
This latest book of his has caused
a f l u r r y of comments. In fact so many
varying c r i t i c i s m s have been written
on this book that one i s l e f t i n u t t e r
confusion a f t e r reading them. One
describes the book as 'Young America
debauching old Europe' and yet
another as 'Old Europe debauching
young America'. C r i t i c s have been
f i n d i n g a l l manner of hidden meanings
from the undertones i n Humbert's brain
but author Nabokov says that i t s just
another story with no moral intended.
He wrote i t because the story occurred
to him and he l i k e d i t .
The i n s p i r a t i o n came while he was
l i v i n g i n l a r i s and he wrote i t as a
short story i n Russian, the places and
people contained being French. Not
l i k i n g the finished a r t i c l e he
destroyed i t and so i t remained f o r ten
years t i l l i t s r e b i r t h i n the present
form.
Publishers presented with i t were
appalled and considered i t obscene and
would not p r i n t . Thus started the
w e l l known controversy which raged t i l l
at last we can see f o r ourselves.
As a complete contrast, the
second book discussed i s BORSTAL' BOY
by 3RENDAIV BEKAN, price 16/-.
This i s an autobiography of
certainly the most vivacious playwright
of our time. In t h i s book he deals with
his l i f e from the time of his arrest i n
Liverpool f o r I.R.A. a c t i v i t i e s to h i s
eventual release and h i s gradual
tendency away from the I.R.A. and
Catholicism to his present humanitarian
ideals which are i l l u s t r a t e d i n h i s
two plays.
He introduces the reader to the
varied assortment of characters who
make up the grey world of prison and
the s l i g h t l y brighter one of a -orstal
I n s t i t u t i o n i n a masterly story. The
screws, wide boys, ponces, toughs, the
Cocxneys, Geordies and Taffies, which
have since dominated his w r i t i n g , are
a l l portrayed i n his own unmistakeable
way. This book i s worth reading, i f
only f o r the insight on prison and
Borstal l i f e ; i f only f o r the oharacter
studies of the inmates; i f only f o r
the comedy and humour contained. I t
should certainly not be missed as a l l
three are i n one memorable volume.
MARXIST SUB-GROUP MEETING
The meeting of the Marxist Sub-
Group on Thursday, Lec. 3rd, was
heralded by a loudspeaker announcement
urging us "to hear a pro-Marxist speaker,
the inference being that thia would
be a change, presumably a kick against
attempts to eradicate t h i s "embarrass-
ment to the I.C. Union", ( F e l i x , Nov.
27th.). W students did turn up to
hear Dr. Lewis speak on "Marxism and
Science".
Dr. Lewis' contention was that the
c a p i t a l i s t system i s incapable of
solving the world's most pressing
problem, that of r a i s i n g the l i v i n g
standards of the 1,700,000,000 human
beings at present l i v i n g below the pov-
erty l i n e . He suggested that B r i t a i n
has not the c a p i t a l resources to
develop her own t e r r i t o r i e s and
that the whole c a p i t a l i s t system i s
hampered by i t s lack of coordination,
and i t s desire to see p o t e n t i a l gain
before investing c a p i t a l . Quoting
surveys and reports on the Soviet
economy made by Western observers,Dr.
Lewis pointed out that the U.3.S.R.
turns out three times as many trained
technologists per year as the U.S.A.,
and that i t has twice as many s c i e n t i s t s
working on fundamental research. He
outlined the Soviet system of s c i e n t -
i f i c research programmes directed by a
central commission with Five-year
planning, and quoted, again from a
Western report, that i n some instances
(e.g. i n machine tools) Soviet industry
i s much more e f f i c i e n t than the
c a p i t a l i s t industry. The question
was, would capitalism show i t s e l f able
to cope with the world's population
problems, or would the s o c i a l i s t block,
with i t s undoubted economic and s c i e n t -
i f i c resources, step i n f i r s t ? •
Dr. Lewis confined himself to the
material aspects of modern Marxism and
in the discussion only two questions
touched on human rights and the p o s i t i o n
of minorities under Marxism. There i s
no doubt that the U.S.S.R. can now
produce more trained technologists than
the Western world, but can i t produce
individuals capable of> and allowed,
o r i g i n a l thought and action? Does
Marxism reduce the individual to a mere
cog, with l i t t l e control over his own
future, as the Readers Digest t r i e s to
t e l l us?
Whatever the answers to these
questions, i t i s certain that unless
the c a p i t a l i s t world concerns i t s e l f
more with the under-developed countries,
the s o c i a l i s t block w i l l convert more
and more of these countries to communism,
to the detriment of our position.
In his concluding remarks, L r . Lewis
t o l d the meeting i n strong terms that
far too many overfed people ape content
to ignore the f a c t that two-thirds of
the world's population i s always hungry,
and that i f we do not face t h i s prob-
lem, then, i n one form or another, i t
w i l l overwhelm us.
MUSIC with a BEAT
I f you prefer swing to tangos,
i f you'd rather hear Lyttleton, Brown
and Barber, than the Joe Blogg? s
Sextet, i f you think Cole, S i n a t r a
Fitzgerald,Mathis, Peggy and Sarah
are the tops, and i f you l i k e j i v i n g
to Bobby Darin, Lonnie Donnegan, C l i f f
Richards, the undulating E l v i s and the
beat of B i l l y May, Ted Heath, Basic
or Mulliean, make a date f o r the s e r i e s
of record hops at I.C.
The f i r s t one was on Wednesday,
2nd. December i n the top refectory at
the Union and from the noise a good
evening appeared t o be had by a l l .
A f i n a l word to the V i c t o r
