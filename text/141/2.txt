KPE 333
And in this column, ladies and
gentlemen, we have the slightly aged
chairman of A.C.C. Fantastic?
Well, not really. Randal i s a very
diverse character, as any thumbologist
will t e l l you immediately from the
photograph of his thumb which appears
above. His early history illustrates
this diversity. Born in England in
'34, he lived in New Zealand until
1940. From 1943 to 1952 he was at
Christ's Hospital (School!).
After which he did an apprentice-
ship with Ford's where he learnt a
great deal about cars and a l i t t l e about
women. He then did his National
Service, obtained a Commission and went
to Singapore with R.E.M.E. During
his stay, he spent three weeks playing
rugby in Japan in a combined service
tour (where he learnt a l i t t l e more
about women). he then abandoned the
orient and came to Guilds. (Whew!) His
ability to run in a determined fashion
whilst carrying the l i t t l e leather
ball, gained him a place in the I.C.
1st Rugby team of which he was Captain
in his 2nd Year. He i s of a phil-
osophic turn of mind, having lived
next door to Sydney Lenssen for two
years. Despite this mishap he i s
remarkably sane and balanced in out-
look. He hopes to get a degree this
year and build a new oar. He s t i l l
plays rugger and finds time to keep
the A.C.C. i n order, a no mean thing.
There i s no information to hand
about his present contacts with the
f a i r sex, except that such contacts
are known to exist. The remainder
of this profile has been censored.

HOROLOGY
HOW T O PLAY CHESSE
Chesse i s a very interesting game
and oan be played by simply anyone (or
anyone simple). There are two par-
ticiples, one having White peace-
types and the other having Black peace-
types. White has nominally the
f i r s t movement, and then they move in
A.C. fashion.
The game i s played on a squared
board of sixty four sauarelets by
eight, which are alternatively black-
white-black etc. or white-black-white,
depending on the choice of coordinates.
There are two blasting directions,
i.e. x and y hatchets. The ox hatchet
is concerned with the ranks or side-
ways horizontals (horizons), whereas
Introduction:
On consultation of the possibil-
ity of buying a watch,this body decided
to investigate analytically the claim of
a well-known firm of horologists that
their timepiece made the journey from
King's Cross to Edinburgh attached to
the piston-rod of the Flying Scotsman,
without detriment to itself or apparent
harm to the engine attached thereto.
Assumptions:
(1) Speed of express train (by definition)
y a 60 mph.
(2) Diameter of Driving Wheel a 2yds.
(as for Charles I).
(3) Piston Stroke = 26" (Machine Drawing
and Design by W. Abbot, p. 87, pub.
Blackie & Sons Ltd., London and Glas-
gow, 10/6d.) « 2r.
(4) That the length of the connecting
rod i s long compared to that of the
crank.
(5) That i f and when you drop your watch
you drop i t through a height of
3 f t . , and that as a result i f i t
buries itself in the floor to a depth
of 0.01".
Calculations:
Speed of train = 60 mph a 88 ft/seo.

Conclusions:
Thus i t can be seen that whilst
the test oh the Flying Scotsman subjects
the watch to acceleration and deceler-
ation equal to 29g., the dropping of a
watch onto a f a i r l y soft floor subjects
the poor beast to a deceleration of
3,490g., i.e. 120 times as great, and
demonstrates the complete worthlessness
of the test as far as the watch i s con-
cerned, iih&t effect i t had on the care-
fully balanced reciprocating parts of
the locomotive we have been unable to
ascertain.
A Cuckoo Clock was finally
purchased.
the oyez hatchet i s to do with files
(fern, f i l l i e s ) , which are up and down
vertioules. There are also the
diatherms, mathematically expressed as
x a y + c, these are vertical and hori-
zontal diagogonals whioh cover square-
lets of the same calibre.
Diddle-criptione' of peace-type3
Prawn (fern, pawnee) This is the basic
unit of peace-time and oan move upwards
on the y-axis only, at the rate of one
squarelet per move. However, when
i t starts out, i t has the chance of a
single a double (or perhaps redouble)
squarelet jumps.
Knight (fern, knightie) This i s easily
recognised by its hearses' head (hence
- 'the bead of Knight') It i s the only
peace that can huff i.e. jump over other
peaces. Its movement consists of one
vertioule and two horizons and viva-
Bishopric (fem. bushel and peck) This
peaoe i s indispensible, but can only
move on the diatherms. It i s a very
useful mating piece.
Queenebeeste (no. masculine). This
peace is the most powerful one of a l l ,
having combined movements of bishopric
and rook. It i s therefore the peace de
resistance.
King-Kong (no. fem. ) This i s the most
important peace of a l l and had only one
squarelet per move (see motive).
Rook {tern, rookie) also oastle.
This peace moves up and down the ranks
and files (i.e. agitates), cf tank.
The arrangement of the peaces
starting cm the white squarelet on the
first rank, R.H.S. to L.H.S., are as
follows. KRKNKBKKQB^BgNQR and then
on the second rank:- PPPPPPPP.
Motive
The idea of the game i s to chase
other King-Kong (King-fish) until he
oannot move without you taking him.
This cursory when attacking opposite
King-Kong to say 'checkee', chuckee,
clucky, whoopee, f — ., and wakey-
wakey. When someone i s mated (i.e.
sponded), the player can say chucky
and matey (tough, rough, and over-ruff)
- Winner exit3 with bish up nosh.
How to Caption
One can take (caption) opposing
peace type i f own peace-types controlley
same squarelet. Not that a prawn has
a single squarelet diagonal intake.
Very difficult moves (for experts only)
1) Chastising ( 0 - 0 , 0-0-H, C=0-0,ct^j)
This i s a combined effort of King-
Kong and rook. King-Kong moves two
3quare3to right or left, and the rook
leaps over him and plunges onto adjacent
squarelet to his majesty. The follow-
ing rules apply (l) no indisposed peaces,
(2) King-Kong must be static, (3) King-
Kong must not be a Czech.
2) tfueening a pawn
This i s the perfect joy for be-
gogonals. The prawn i s sent
willy-nilly down a f i l e , until i t
reaches the eighth rank. Hare i t
can become another chosen peace-
type, usually a ^ueenebeeste
(whoopee) to the disconcemation of the
aenemone. We shall omit the en-
parsant which i s too fresh anyway.
