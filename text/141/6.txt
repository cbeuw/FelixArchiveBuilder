FELIX
RCS.
NEVER HAD IT
SO GOOD
Two ladies nights, one Nobel
Laureate main Guest, and an e f f i c i e n t
team of beer waiters. What oould go
wrong? As unpredictable as ever the four
R.C.S. Fresher's Dinners provided some
strange new features.A rubber mat
thrower ; a team of weak hladdere* r a d i -
c a l s ; an unscrupulous bear snatchers ;
a cihain smoker assaulted by devout Royal-
i s t s ; were prepared t o remedy a l l these
l i t t l e t r o u b l e s . But the f i r s t Dinner
went so smoothly that we concluded,
Auntie must have been mistaken; people
were getting nioer. Charlie ushered us
from the sherry to the Dinner and dined
us to the speeches . Happily received.
Prof. Barrer played the lovable r e m i n i -
scing F.R.S.. Les A l l e n the w i t t y f r i e n d l y
student king , while Mitch and Theata
discussed how out of place they both f e l t .
I f Guilds had S i r Frederick Handley Page,
R.C.S. at t h e i r seoond dinner had Ernest
Wayne the great Canadian l i t e r a t e , f o l l -
ower of Dylan Thomas and 'Herbert Ogg'.
His fumbling,technical speech on Love
and Photography ,packed with phony
philosophy and misquotations delighted an
awe inspired stag dinner - including a
group of nomads, dressed i n the dashing,
d i r t y dandy uniforms only associable with
R.C.S. geologists. Few r e a l i s e that be
was an amiable but unknown exchange
teacher whom we: recruited an hour before-
hand to f i l l a ghastly guest gap. A
piano, a jbke from Dr. Raimes and a sweet
Kangella i n the Bar convinced us. People
were nioer. What would you do i f after
a concentrated, entrancing conversation
with professor Blackett you happened to
glance round to f i n d your other guest
engaged i n a Beer battle? Would you
walk out and cry duok? or f a l l on your
fork?
I myaelf d i d none of these, f o r i t
was apparent that Professor Blaokett -
the greatest s c i e n t i s t attending a
Freshers' dinner - was r e v e l l i n g i n i t
a l l . He disoussed h i s naval days,
the lifelessness of today's students,
the dullness of Commemoration Day, and
the aerodynamics of a stray mat returning
to roost on an unsuspecting fresher.
Calm oame, we want, bilged beer, sang
songs and only vaguely dreamt the thought.
"Who wants people to be n i c e , anyway?"
Morphy week, which w i l l go down i n
History as Morphy week, was ideal f o r
the l a s t nice,quiet ladies night. With
a small fifty-man esoort,two doubles
and a running-board eaoape from Weeks
H a l l into another aggressive scrum of
'Mechanics' the R.C.S. President began
an unusual evening.
However Professor Porter d i d not
throw beer at Lady Anne Thome, nor did
Dr. Stephens pose as Charles Dickenb
(these were confused rumours a r i s i n g from
one of my many nightmares t h i s Autumn).
Congratulations go to Mr. Mooney
who d i d not put us on war rations and
the R.C.S. marr-who shielded entering guests
from a suapioious g o r i l l a gang of doubt-
f u l l o r i g i n .
This, the happiest dinner of a l l
ended i n a few moments f o r good-
byes i n the I.C.W.A. lounge. Then
R.C.S. courageous but ungregarious had
to ehoose between trouserless communion
with the boys and their castle i n the
Queen's. A p a t i a l observer oonments:
"A trouserless R.C.S. Ixoecutive saw
their President roar a strange ohant from
the quad w a l l , shout f o r some trans-
action involving a Union and a Horse,
and plung desperately into a blood t h i r s t y
mob of what now appear to have been druid
labourers on t h e i r way to a s a c r i f i c e at
their shrine i n Wiltshire.
I am s t i l l glad that the R.C.S.
Geology department had decided against
kidnapping an unmascoted president
e a r l i e r that day (the very thought!)
Most of the two hundred and f i f t y
Freshers have been introduced to t h e i r
Union and next year they w e i l l entertain
a new group of R.C.S. students. Several
members of s t a f f are now more closely
linked to the Union. However the
dinners have f a i l e d i f the hosts and t h e i r
guests part and forget the Union. Some
do, and many w i l l pass through College
l i f e without i t s having any impact on
them at a l l . The others w i l l reap the
benefits.

L.U.D.S.
Once again, I.C.D.S. entered t h i s
f e s t i v a l i n i t s t r a d i t i o n a l manner of not
knowing whether t o t r y t o win o r to give
freshers acting experience. Again
following precedent the cast was mainly
composed of new members of the Society
who acquitted themselves very favourably
under the rather chaotic arrangements of
having to rehearse i n nearly every room
i n I.C. Union. Also, the discovery
that one costume had been l e f t behind,
and having to slap on make-up i n t e r r i f i c
haste, were not conducive to calm nerves
on the night.
The play, a modern adaptation of
"Pseudolus" by Plautus, was, while being
very o r i g i n a l , rather d i f f i c u l t to stage
convincingly. I t was mainly concerned
with the efforts of a slave (Pseudo.) to
recover h i s master's mistress from a
fate worse than death with an army
captain i n foreign service. Unfortunate-
l y , much of the i n t e r e s t i n g vernacular
whioh I am assured exists i n the o r i g i n a l
had to be toned down i n t r a n s l a t i o n .
Pseudolus was played w i t h great verve
by Andrew Chalmers, under the handicap
of a false p o t - b e l l y and enormous
b u i l t - o u t feet. G i l l i a n Harrold, as
the brothel-keeper, coped w e l l w i t h a
part whioh I f e e l sure i s f a r removed
from her nature, managing very w e l l a
r e a l l y v i l e Birmingham accent.
Also worthy of mention i s N i g e l King,
who brought the house down w i t h h i s
d e l i g h t f u l playing of an effete young
nobleman. The "ladies of the house",
surely the most thankless of parts, were
played by Brenda Taplin, Rosemary Kerfoot
and Beverley Bradford; who, I f e e l , had
a l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t y i n l i v i n g ' t h e part,
f o r which I would c e r t a i n l y not blame
them.
The stage manager was Chris Nicholas,
under whose commendably e f f i c i e n t
d i r e c t i o n a l l ran smoothly, once we got
on te the U.L.U. stage.
Colin Dixon,the dlrector(he declined
the t i t l e 'producer') did very w e l l t o
induce some cohesion into a somewhat
d i s j o i n t e d play. I t i s , perhaps, to be
regretted that the adjudioator and he had
a fundamental disagreement on the way i n
whioh the play aheuld be presented,
which was no f a u l t of either of them.

Last Saturday night at the New
V i c t o r i a Cinema the Modern Jazz Quartet
gave t h e i r l a s t show of t h e i r present
tour. The performance, was a very
disappointing a f f a i r as oompared with
M.J.Q. standards. This was mainly
due t o the presence o f the two B r i t i s h
guest stars, Ronnie R03S (baritone sax)
and Joe H a r r i o t t ( a l t o sax). Their
s t y l e of playing with complicated solos
straight out o f a poor E l l i n g t o n band,
just d i d not f i t i n with the suave and
sophisticated jazz played by the M.J.Q.
The oombined o u t f i t completely s p o i l t a
f i n e standard piece such as "Django",
the only item bearable being Ros3's
treatment of "Body and Soul".
The quartet, however, were t h e i r
usual immaculate selves, as was apparent
i n items ranging from " I ' l l Remember
A p r i l " , "The Queen Fancy", etc. to new
pieces l i k e "Concierge". However, the
acoustics of the New V i c t o r i a l e f t muoh
to be desired, f o r i t s p o i l t the
economical and sensitive piano playing
of John Lewis. The other s o l o i s t ,
M i l t Jackson on vibes, played many
interesting and i n t r i c a t e solos, and
c e r t a i n l y maintained my opinion that he
i s the greatest vibes player i n the
world.
Connie Kay on drums and Percy
Heath on bass s t o l e the show.Connie
Kay> by precise technique, always
obtained a b e a t i f u l sound from
his instruments", which included
tympani, gong, t r i a n g l e and very small
cymbals. Percy Heath on bass must
surely be one of the jazz greats.
An enjoyable evening was had by a l l .
We must thank the National Jazz
Federation for allowing us to see the
M.J.Q. once again.
I should l i k e i t to be known that
the weds, Record Hops are i n no way
interconnected w i t h the I.C. Jazz Club
