Spectators at the recent Mines Dept.
Snd Year and 3rd Year Soccer matoh
decided that i t was perhaps his excess
Vteight that prevented the referee,
Richard Garaett, from keeping up with
She ball. On visiting the College
doctor on the following day, however,
R.H.T. learnt that he was suffering
from lumbago. His colleague Mr. Ewart,
has been heard to warn him that the
stage is gout and then thrombosis.

overwhelmed, I.C. being unable to win a
single event. The polo would not have
taken place i f i t had not been for A.
Eylea, who shinned precariously up to
the roof on a rope to free a jammed net.
I.C. won the polo after a hard struggle
by 2 goals to 1. However Q.M.C. were
unable to score after I.C's Capt. was
ordered out of the water during the
second half. The 3rd team fought well
to beat Morphy-Riohards W 5 .

A SOCCER MATCH
At 2.30 p.m. on Sunday the 29th
November a football match took place
between the seconu and third year Miners
in Hyde Park. Many spectators
gathered during the course of the game,
and were treated to a display of soccer
that kept them in f i t s of laughter for
over an hour. Contributory factors
were several. First of a l l there was
the fact that the larger part of both
teams was made up of rugger, and not
soccer players, then to help matters the
pitch was about two inches deep i n mud,
and finally there had been a small
birthday oelebration for Jack Mawdesley
before the match.
The following i s an unbiased account
of the match offered by M.J. Matthews,
I. H i l l , E. Spursht, H. Howell and
B. Hindley.
As the teams tottered on to the lush
mud of Hyde Park Stadium i t was obvious
that they were going to give a never-to-
be forgotten display of soccer skills
and sartorial styles. The teams,
staggering a l i t t l e under the weight of
their lunchtime refreshment, lined up
with roughly eleven on each side, a
whistle was blown, and play commenced ....
For twenty minutes chaos reigned and
Muddy Matthews raced from end to end
exhorting his men to score in either goal
and at the same time trying to avoid
Mopper Mawdesley, then ten minutes before
half time i t happened.
Swivel-Hips Howard collected the
ball near the halfway line, beat five
men with one body-swerve, causing
Creasem Creasey and Blotto Otto to
collide with a crash that shook the
surrounding buildings. Meanwhile a
thirty yard trot took Swivel-Hips to the
outside right position from where he
slipped a pass to Suave Harv., who, after
a moment of indecision, accidentally got
rid of the ball. The ball rebounded
from defender to defender and finally
a Charlton-like shot from ace inside far-
ward Deadly Hedley screamed inside the
post to oome to rest some two feet over
the line. At this point the goalie
Leave-it-to-ms Longden, emerged from the
mud and appealed for offside. The
referee, Gorgeous Garnett (dressed in
Paris suede shoe3 and Portobello Road
trousers) made his one correct decision
of the afternoon and allowed the goal.
With the halftime score at 1-0,
both teams having had a quick drag and
a pep talk from their many supporters
whose comments were as follows"???*'.!!
you shower", Mines 2 continued the
slaughter. They put two more goals in
the net but both were disallowed by the
ref. who, finding himself unable to keep
up with the play, and being an honest man,
oould not allow goals he did not see.
However, the play was not a l l with
Mines 2; after a scintillating run,
Bookie Banks cracked in a shot which the
impregnable T. Caddy palmed round the
post for a corner. Creasem Creasy
curved the ball into the goalmouth from
the resulting corner and T. Caddy made
his one mistake of the matoh in fending
off the goalpost as well as the ball.
Whilst Mines 2 were appealing for a foul
and Mines 3 for a goal, Bookie Banks
found the ball at his feet and sent i t
rocketing towards goal. At this moment
the dazed goalie realising that he was
not permanently damaged, struggled to his
feet, and summing up the situation in an
instant, grabbed the ball and grovelled
with i t in his usual inimitable manner
in the mud.
CROSS COUNTRY
On Wednesday 25th. November the
second team were hosts to teams from
University College,Kings College,
Royal Veterinary College, and the
Lsndon School of Economics, in. a -
match i n tne Â£nd Division of the London
League. They won by a very wide margin,
individual honours going to Paul Auton
who was f i r s t . Ed. Bennett ran well
to finish third while the unpredictable
George Turner, who was not nominated for
the team, but took part, ran a blinder
and finished fourth.
On the following Saturday the
f i r s t team were the guests of Lloyds
Bank and ran over a course at Hayes i n
Kent, while the second team travelled out
to Coxtie Green i n Essex to run against
Queen Mary College and Goldsmiths College.
At Hayes, good packing by the I.C. men.
who occupied a l l positions from 3 to 10,
won the day. Old man Silly, who has
on numerous occasions threatened to
retire, ran as usual and finished 10th.
At Coxtie Green the second team defeated
their opponents in spite of a l l but
one of the scoring runners going off
course. The man who knew the geography
Chris James, finished third, closely
followed by Clare (5), Butler (6) and
Fearn (7).
Wednesday 2nd December 3
a
W the
first team travelling cut to Reading for
a match with the local University.
This was won by 62 pts. to 79 principally
due to the efforts of John -Collins (2)
and Jim Bernard ( 3 ) .
Last Saturday (5th Dec.) a f i r s t
team raoe against Ranelagh Harriers and
Southampton University was combined with
a second team matoh against R.AiF.
Cranwell. The f i r s t team lost to
Ranelagh Harriers by two points but
defeated Southampton, while the second
team disgraced i t s e l f i n losing to
Cranwell. The race was very fast and
several personal records were broken by
large margins. For the first team the
ace U.L.runners Barber and Cleator finished
second and third respectively. First
home for the second team was D. Fearn
ably supported by C. James.
Far a further ten minutes the two
forward lines struggled manfully with the
conditions, and suddenly Gorgeous Garnett
finding play within range of his whistle,
blew f u l l time; the better team had won.
Note: Allegations that the referee
was bribed are completely unfounded.
