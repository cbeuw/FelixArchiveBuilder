FELIX
NOW IT CAN BE TOLD
You may remember that some
time ago "Bo" was removed by some
Southampton students. Now i t i s poss-
i b l e to give the f u l l story, as seen
through the eyes of the Press. A large
number of newspapers, varying from the
Times to the Korthern Echo, Darlington
and the "Gioranle D ' I t a l i a d e l l a Dominica"
of Roma featured the story. Let us
f i r o t investigate hew the raiders
removed the car. F i r s t the Times.
"Four students made o f f with the car
a f t e r spending two hours moving a dynamo .
weighing a ton and a half." The H a l i f a x
Courier and Guardian - "Two doors were
broken down i n getting i t away". The
Northern Eoho Darlington went i n t o
d e t a i l - "^Gordon Moore,aged 25 and Mike
Thorne, aged 22 got into a coal c e l l a r
and l e t i n Terry Marsh, 18, and h i s 2G
year o l d g i r l f r i e n d Mary Sexton. They
were i n the b u i l d i n g nearly s i x hours.....
Once again Sex rears i t s ugly head.
The I t a l i a n paper mentioned, was very
b r i e f and t o the point "Poiche un
generatore d i oorrente d e l peso d i 1500
chilogramnd impediva i l passaggio d e l l a
antioa "James and Browne" g l i studenti
hanno r a z z i a t o , i n una adiacente palestra,
t u t t i i p a t t i n i a r o t e l l e ohe hanno
trovato e, smontatene l e ruOte, hanno
disseminato s u l pavimento i c u s c i n e t t i
a sfere s u i q u a l i hanno f a t t o r scorrere
i l pesante aggeggio." "H pesante
aggeggio" indeed. I t i s high time that
these foreign newspapers got t h e i r facta
r i g h t .
Next t o the statements made by
"spokesmen" "President o f I.C." and
several other worthies. Yorkshire Post-
"(the students) have been told they w i l l
be prosecuted unless the car i s returned.*
The Exeter Express and Echo - ""The Car
belongs tb the City and guilds Motor Club
and i s a very valuable model" said a,
spokeman".
Various other words were supposed to
have been said by people usually denoted by
"spokesman". Looking through "these
cuttings one notices that Bo i s thought
to be the mascot of "London Engineering
Students", according t o such widely
spaced papers as the B e l f a s t News l e t t e r ,
The Dorset D a i l y Echo and the Birmingham
Post. But a l l these have a smattering
of truth. The Evening News indulged
i n a r e a l f l i g h t of fanoy and stated,
quite c a t e g c r i o a l l y , that Bo i s " a 1902
De Dion Bouton". For some reason, best
known to themselves, the Evening Standard
said "a 1902 French Boanerges Car has
disappeared from Imperial College ."
The l a s t word should be had by
our I t a l i a n f r i e n d s . In a l l j u s t i c e
they say " I I cancello d e l l a v i l l e t t a
abitata d a l parroco, protestante, d e l
v i l l a g g i o era stato festonato da p i u
di una dozzina d i s o t t o v e s t i ed a l t r i
indumenti m u l t i c o l o r i " .
AROUND
THE
TOWN
Several weeks ago when commenting
upon the Old Vic's production of "As You
Like It", I said that i t was quite re-
freshing to see them trying to break away
from purely conventional interpretations
that have so long been handed down from
generation to generation of amateur groups;.
The present production of Richard II is now
I feel another step backwards. The scenes
and lighting effects are as usual excellent
but the acting lacks that creative imagina-
tion which a good producer should be able
to enthuse into his players. Richard,
a king who is morally weak yet proudly
arrogant, believing in his divine right,
is brought to his tragic death by the
growing forces of thos e who believe in
the right to a freely chosen monarchy.
The actions and thoughts are therefore the
natural-result of his attitude and the
attitude of his forebears, that he was
chosen of God. He is not a play-boy
nor is he effeminate, but many times
he has been presented as each and John
.Justin does not step out of line.
George Baker as Bollngbroke, also lacks
the power and conviction of a man who is
strong and surely rather sinister when
compared with Richards weakness and
innocenoe. The play is above a l l a
poetio masterpiece and should not be
missed,if only for this reason.
I regret to Say that musicals,
unless they are good and I mean really
good, bore me more than any other type
of entertainment, (including the London
Zoo). Eric Spear and Charles Macarthur
Hardy who have written Kookaburra which is
now running at the Princes Theatre, lack
that stroke of genius that can turn a
rather weak play with songs into a great
show. The play without songs was Joyce
Denny's, Rain Before Seven, which is a
study of an Australian household in the
"outback" into which a young rarmer im-
plants his recently acquired English wife,
natural complications arise. Tne songs or
Eric Spear occasionally interupt the course
or the plot but do l i t t l e more beyond tnis.
ine comedy is Australian. Let me say
no more.'
A Lesbian, A woman who has murdered
ler illegitimate child and a coward who
betrayed hie friends in a South American
revolution, are locked together in a.
room for eternity. This is the dramatic
situation created in Jean Paul Sartre's
play "Huis Cloe" and now after years of
censorship }ust released as a film under
the English t i t l e of "Vicious Circle".
Tnis is Sartre's idea of hell. i r i s ,
the Lesbian, tries to ^ i n d consolation
for her situation in Estille. Estille
tries to gain support from the masculine
leader-ship of liarcia wno in turn feeling
hi a weakness tries to rind understanding
through Iria. The vicious circle is
complete. Tnia is an experience which
may shock you or t h r i l l you, but at"
least I think that you must feel a
strange sympathy with the idea.
A new and well publicised recent
release is "The Hor8e Soldiers". It
ia a "retake" of the well tried equation
of American Cavalry, Civil War, innocent
young aoldiers who did not want to fight
in any case, and one young attractive
female, preferably with red or blond hair.
John Wayne leads the merry band, who are
poisea to win the war by attacking a vital
supply route. The rest of the film could
be called, "Incidents On the Journey".
This production would have been a master-
piece i n 1929.

ART CLUB
There are many gap3 i n our College
l i f e gap3 whioh people are always
trying to f i l l , though sometimes c r e a t i
ing; one such gap w i l l be f i l l e d (we
hope i n December) by an e x h i b i t i o n of
paintings, drawings, sculpts etc:
contributed by members of I.C., both
students and s t a f f . The e x h i b i t i o n
w i l l not be large but we hope, of reas-
onable quality. Anyway, that you may
judge f o r yourselves.
judge f o r yourselves - i n comfort - f o r
i t i s to be held i n the upper lounge.
We f e e l that i t i s preferable to have a
l i t t l e crowding i n the hangings, with
comfort f o r the patrons, rather than
widely spaced pictures viewed to the
music of unrythmical t i p i t i t a t s of heels
on marble f l o o r s .
Oh, by the way the f i n a l seleotion
has not yet been made, 30 i f there i s a
anyone (student or s t a f f ) not yet known
to the Art Club Chairman, who would l i k e
to e x h i b i t , w i l l he please contact M.
Gerlooh soon.
A point worthy of mention, we think,
i s t h i s : there w i l l be a number of
modernistic or even abstract paintings-
although many people are f a i r l y well
aquainted with these styles of a r t ,
there are s t i l l many who misunderstand
and even despise them out of hand. We
plead, therefore, to get to know and
understand, to be excited by, any form
of v i s u a l or other art, you must set
out to l i k e them. Your l i k i n g , at
f i r s t , may have no b e t t e r foundation
than snobbery, but i t w i l l soon
c r y s t a l l i s e to either d i s l i k e f o r good
reasons or an admiration with s i n c e r i t y .
And then, of course, you are an A r t
lover with much sought a f t e r opinions!!
