W.US. IN NIGERIA
That a university and the sooiety
within which i t develops are inter-
dependent i s widely recognised today.
In the younger countries this relation-
ship is particularly important for
often the university i s not aware of
its own needs or i t s servioes to
sooiety. One can say that the
fostering of the university community
i t s e l f to enable i t to serve i t s e l f
and society i s a cardinal aim of
W.U.S. .
In Nigeria, this servioe began
six years ago when a committee includ-
ing students and staff members was
formed at the University College,
Ibadan - Nigeria's sole university
institution. No doubt many of the
members of this committee knew next to
nothing about W.U.S. and only joined
in out of a spirit of adventure and
fear of not being left out of a "new
thing". That the original composi-
tion was not the best i t could be was
soon evident from the attitude of the
college to W.U.S. Many people felt
i t was an exclusive group camouflaging
under a sweet name.
The committee's character has
therefore changed in the past years
with a view to representing as many
interests as possible.
Nowadays the ooamittee consists
of student representatives nominated
by such bodies as the Students'
Union, the U.N.S.A., the S.C.M., the
Fax Romana and others. In addition
to these students, ethers are appointed
as members-at large,usually because
or neip they are able to render to
the committee. Then there are staff
members who are however i n a numerical
minority. Although a staff member i s
appointed chairman, students are
appointed as vice-chairman and secret-
ary.
An exchange scheme has been
arranged whereby a postgraduate stu-
dent crosses from Nigeria to the Univ-
ersity of British Columbia in Vancou-
ver and vice versa, under the auspices
of W.U.S. The value of the personal
contact involved i n this scheme oan
hardly be overemphasised.
The W.U.S. in Nigeria has been
the reoipient of gifts from outside.
A mimeographing machine and a type-
writer donated by W.U.S. international
body have helped the several student
organisations within the college to
meet their publishing commitments.
More and more W.U.S. at Ibadan
aims to educate the university about
the need for a world university
service and i t s advantages.
MOTORING NEWS
The season so far has been a very
successful one for the olub. In
particular support for meetings has
been very good and competitive events
well supported numerically.
The year started with a record number
of members Joining at the freshers'
reception, including several from R.C.S.
and R.S.M. who were invited to join for
the f i r s t time. Several good recent
films on motoring have been shown,
including a rare film on the Cummins
Diesel Race Car at Indianapolis, U.S.A.
and Coupe des Alpes, 1958, reckoned to
be one of the best films on motor sport
ever made. A quiz on motoring was well
reoeived and enthusiastically answered,
and a talk by a member on "Special
Building" started off aome lively contro-
veray on the subject.
Reoently about a dozen members tried'
their hand at Driving Teats with good
results, finishing 1, 2, 3, on handicap,
a considerable achievement against the
North London Enthusiasts C.C. and the
rest of University.
Bo has given a more than usual
amount of trouble after the extensive
professional overhaul in summer. He
reached Brighton with 55 minutes to spare
having been propelled more by manpower
than engine power.
The plana for the rest of the
aeaaon are well advanced and include a
visit to the M.S. Car Company and to
Lord Montagu' a car museum at Beaulieu.
The main competitive event i s the
inter-college rally organised by a
eommittee of U.H.U.L.M.C. members from
a l l the colleges of the University.
Again a good entry from Guilds will
make success easier for the club.
CONSERVATIVE S0U1BT-
In addressing the Society recently
on the European Free Trade Association,
Mr. Maurice Macmillan, M.P. for Halifax
gave a most interesting and informative
talk. However, comparatively few people
attended to hear his lecture. The
Society therefore encourages you to come
and make future meetings as thought
provoking as Politios should be.
