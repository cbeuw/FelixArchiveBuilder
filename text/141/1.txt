THE NEWSPAPER
OF
IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Friday December llth.
Gangsters and Molls ran amok In
the Union during "At Home with Al
Capons". Strange hats,and even
stranger shirts were i n evidence, but
the ideas of what the Chicago ganster
looked like were varied and mostly
incorrect. One gentleman, who
apparently was s t i l l thinking of the
last Gad-Ids Carnival turned ap dressed
as a pirate. when questioned about
this a l l he said was "Poetic Licence".
Whether the accent should be on the
Beetle or the Licence, who knows?
Young ladies, mostly of pleasing pro-
portions, appeared i n this, that and
the other, (mostly the other) adding
decoration of the most pleasing kind.
The flats and decor were excellent,
really excellent. "Rush" designed the
flats and deserves congratulations for
them. "Lefty" Hawkins was i n charge
of the construction and the chief
organiser, was Eddie "Pelvis" Fersht.
The nickname i s of recent origin, due
to the fact that he f e l l off a ladder and
bruised his hip while taking down the
flats. There are two versions to this
mishap. Eddie's version i s that
someone moved the ladder, everyone else's
is that he f e l l asleep and then f e l l
off. May we offer our condolences?
The Cabaret, written by Eddie and
Pete Morgan with music by Stan Salmons
was produced by Pete Morgan. Arms
"Disengaged" Phillips sang some of the
songs, i n an attitude of careless abandon,
whioh i s the only phrase whioh adequately
describes her costume. "He's a King"
"Me and my sub-aiaohinegun" were, I
thought witty and well performed. In
fact the whole oabaret was well done.
The Security system was devised
by "Big Ben" Bindley 'that- well rounded
ohesa personality who has the misfor-
tune to live above Frank Irving.
Unfortunately, while acting the part of
the body to perfection in "Hunt the
Body", he lost his watch i n a sea of
tomato ketchup. He later got his watch
back, but the tomato ketchup proved
irrecoverable.
The bar was well manned and well
patronised even to the extent of Arthur
and Howard who popped i n far a. quick
one after the Union Bar was olosed.

Mr. Mooney was also i n attendance,
supervising the food in the Lower and
Upper Dining Halls.
People were s t i l l dancing at
5 o'clock, and apparently had enough
energy left to enjoy themselves. Of
oourse, a number had disappeared to hold
their own private carnivals in Hostel
Rooms. Altogether an enjoyable Carnival,
free from riots and ribaldry. The
organisers deserve thanks for a l l the
work they did i n making the Carnival the
undoubted success that i t was.

The I.C. Union General Meeting has
now decided that students from this
College shall boycott a l l goods from
the Union of South Africa. For the
benefit of those who have not thought
seriously about this, i t w i l l be use-
ful to mention some of the articles now
taboo.
It is, of course, obvious that tin-
ned fruits are out. No more peaches,
pears, apricots or passion fruit. No
more Outspan oranges. W
e must tell
Mooney about this. No South African
sherry before Hall Dinner, so we'11
have to pay twice the price for the real
thing. We must not watoh the Spring-
boks when they're next over her (Rugger
and Crioket Clubs, please note). But
laekies, what have our politicians done!
Gold and diamonds come from South Africa.
No more engagement rings'. Woe i s
I.C.W.A.
But let us boycott further. We
are a l l aware that a Colour Bar exists
in the U.S.A. As a logical step, we
must boycott a l l things American. No
cigarettes, few records^ hardly any
films, no Jayne, and no Jazz. Jazz
Club, disband'. The politicians have
said as much.
The French of course, are wicked
oppressors in Algeria. No brandy, wine,
no Bar-dot. S t i l l , we oan always buy
Keg.
Or oan we? Some bright politician
must surely say that the British are the
worst of the lot. Kenya, Nyasaland,
Cyprus, Singapore, Malta, Ireland, Scot-
land, Wales and Nether Hopping. Boy-
cott a l l things British! No food, no
clothes, no nothing'. A merry life
maybe, but rather a short one.
Politicians, grow up! What do you
think we are. Your puerile motion was
passed only because thinking people
stayed away from the meeting. We are
a l l opposed to Apartheid in practice,
but there are more intelligent ways of
voicing disapproval than passing
boycott motions.
It has always been an unwritten
rule at I.C. that politics, in any form,
shall not be a subject of official
Union business. The President has the
power to refuse any motion from the
floor, and an impartial President
would have refused this one. The
approval of this motion must have caused
considerable embarrasment to South
African students here, a fact which
our politicians obviously ignored.
For heavens sake, lets keep polit-
ies, left, right, or upside down, out
of Union affairs. We've got enough
political and racial societies at the
College already to a i r our views in
discussion, without childish hotheads
opening their mouths at Union meetings.
If we can't have intelligent debate at
a Union meeting, lets finish i t at
twenty-past one.
