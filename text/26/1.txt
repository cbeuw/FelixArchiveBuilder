During the last ten days or so, there has been
considerable activity In the " Mines " . The reas-
on for the sudden excess- of energy is the Conversa-
zione on Thursday and Friday, 25th and 26th October.
Bach department In the Mines has put on a displ-
ay to give the 800 Invited guests a good idea of the
type of work undertaken i n the R.S.M. courses.
As normal, the mining department have built a
mine, "The Lost Century Mine", (the century was
presumably lost by dissipation i n the Bessemer Lab-
oratory .L This is entered by descending i n a bucket
and then being hauled on trolleys to the various
drifts and faces. It was decided to issue miners
helmets and lamps to those who make the perilous
descent. The mine has been equipped with a l l the
modern conveniences.
The metallurgical department i s demonstrating
modern foundry practice by casting special ash
trays. The physical metallurgy department are show-
ing the application of X-rays and microscopic thin
sections to the crack testing of castings.
The Assay Laboratory shows the proSuctloniof
metals by electrolytic methods.
The Mining Geology and Geology departments bare
combined to produce 1
'The Geologist at work'.*, tu
the Geology Museum. Large crowds are anticipated as
the Buffet is being served In the room beyond the
museum. This exhibition shows the collection of
information In the field and Its Me to produce a
geological map.
The O i l department are showing exhibits Indica-
ting the work involved when locating" ah o i l f i e l d .
Also there are geophysical and aerial photographic
exhibits. Topical interest films are going to be
shown. Originally i t was intended to d r i l l for o i l
from the 3rd floor. It was found to bo impracticable
for the purely technical reason that the let and 2nd
floors tend to get i n the way.
For those who are thiroty, there ate two bars,
and the musically minded will bo able to Bit and
listen to the band of the Royal Engineers, Chatham.
THE REFECTORY
At the Refectory Comittee meeting held on. October
16th. the refectory accounts for the year ending
31st. July were presented. These showed that a defi-
nite improvement i n the financial state of the ,
refectory had taken place since the taking over of
the management by John Gardners Ltd. It is antici-
pated that i n a f u l l year the loss will be reduced
to a manageable figure.
. The committee also discussed the use of Ayrton
Hali for club functions, the details of which are
being worked out. Owing to the expense entailed in
the recent improvement of refectory f a c i l i t i e s onlj
the'more formal dinners are likely to be held there.
The bar account, which has now been separated
from that of the refectory, shows a decrease4n
profit from about 15){ of turnover in 19i9-5m#p 3%
in 1930-31. In response to a number of complaints
about the inconsistency of the quality of the drau-
ght beer, an advisor from Bhithreads is again '
visiting the College,
L O N G V A C T R A V E L S
"felix" regrets that he omitted to notice the
record attainment of latitude 79 15'H, (and, to be
precise, longitude 12 B) by David Atkinson (Oeolegy),
who spent a balaelara-helmeted "summer" geologising
and surveying on an uninhabited Island off Spits-
bergen. Seas 1800 Biles forth of London Is
probably the record for both I.e. and U.L. this
rear.

At a well attended General Meeting on 9th
Oot., the Drams.tie Society's Christmas production
was o f f i c i a l l y launched. The oo'oaslon could not
be sailed solemn, including such Items as a pro-
cession round the Union with the President i n
-front 4 n « on a stretcher. The route ended In
the bar where the President was advised, to close
the meeting and push the boat out, splice the

cal terms but they spring from the play chosen -
"Off the Record" a naval comedy by Ian Bay and
Stephen King-Ball.

known previously to I.C. audiences as an aotor.
The auditions have been held and rehearsals are

A PIECE OF TC
$ne~Ui#it Reporting Corps of "fhe Evening "Stand-
ard, reporting the Annual Dinner of the Institution
of Mechanical Engineers, gave this story of how the
f i r s * Boffin met again his f i r s t guinea-pig.
The Boffin was Br. D.R.Pye, who, in 1917,
learned that the Germans were using balloons to
proteot ammunition dumps, and so rigged up a b a l l -
oon to test the idea. His young R.F.C. pilot flew
a specially adapted machine into i t , nearly crashed
but "eventually landed" safely and reported "the
barrage balloon i s efflolent."
Last night the young pilot, now A i r Chief
Marshall S i r Roderic H i l l , was guest of honour
« f t M dinner. When Dr. Pye3"J6M-'%fc* wtory, S l F
Roderic twiddled his glass, and i s reported to have
said:"It was nothing - just a pleoe of cake."
