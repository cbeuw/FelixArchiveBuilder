On Friday. 19th, October, a sadly depleted I.C.
Boxing team competed in the U.L. t r i a l s in an effort
to win the "Harry Preston" Cup.
Throughout the evening a close finish seemed
certain, and until the last two bouts I.C. s t i l l
held on grimly to a fragile lead.
London Hospital took, the lead with the Welter-
weight final s t i l l to be decided, but King's came
up from third position in an exciting finish.
Final positions and points were:
King's
London Hospital
I.C.
Goldsmiths'
U.C .
20 points
17 points
16 points
8 points
6 points
It was, in a l l , a very fine performance by the
I.C. team, and heralds well for the future. A l l who
took part are to be congratulated.
Our thanks are due to our instructor, Major
Eley, who did admirable work in our corner.

Although vacation Jobs prevented any
organized team r a c i n g during the summer, some
i n d i v i d u a l members have done very w e l l ; notably
at Hayling I s l a n d , and Abersoch. A l s o , our two
' F i r e f l y ' dinghies, and ;
Impshe6' are always
a v a i l a b l e .
During the past year much work has been put
i n by the members and committee, i n between
t a k i n g a very a c t i v e pert i n a long s e r i e s o f
matches, most of which resulted i n wins f o r the
U.L.R.C. team; consequently, besides winning
the i n t e r - c o l l e g e - p o i n t s cup, ard a match
against Oxford U n i v e r s i t y S a i l i n g Club by 3§
points, we now have three members on the U.L.S.C.
committee, and f i v e of the s i x members o f the
two U.L. teams are from I.C.
London U n i v e r s i t y has swarded J . Conway-
Jones a F u l l Purple, and R. F i s h e r a Half

W. Claydon, and J. Conway-Jones have been
awarded f u l l I.C. colours; and R. F i s h e r and
John E l l i s h a l f colours.
This year, our past p r a c t i c e of i n v i blng

NATIONAL GLIDING CHAMPIONSHIPS, 1951
These were held at the Caraphill site of the Derby
and Lanes. Gliding Club from 22nd to 29th July, and for
the first time, consisted of a series of set tasks as
opposed to the previous free-for-all flying. This pro-
duced keen and even spectacular competition.
When i t was planned to enter an I.C. team, i t was
felt that i t should contain two pilots (who could rapidly
become accustomed to local conditions); that there should
be first-rate returning facilities end that as many blind-
flying aids as possible should be included. In the event,
these conditions were satisfied and the team consisted of
Ron Macfie and Frank Irving (pilots') with Dick Watson and
Bob Gerhardi (crew). The latter happened to possess a
"Vanguard" van capable of towing a glider trailer at a
gratifying, i f somewhat illegal, "relativity". The glider
itself i/aa a shining cream "Olympia" complete with electric
artificial horizon and pitot de-icer.
The first competition day yielded no marks after Ron
Macfie's long hill struggle. The second day's task was
a race to Dunstable, and saw Irving come unstuck only 12
miles from Camphill; to be joined in the same field by the
Army "Olympia" (12 marks). Ron obtained a few marks next
day for gain of height and the day after drizzle stopped
flying. The following day (Thursday) Irving attempted an
R5-mile glide from Camphill, but only reached Driffield,
75 miles away. This was quite a few marks to the good,
but another glider at Driffield also was returning from
Flar..borough Head i
Friday saw Ron trying to ascend a "standing wave" and
busily dodging others trying to do the same. Saturday's
task was to fly to Eoothferry Bridge on the Humber and
return to Camphill. Frank covered the L5 miles to the,
bridge quite smartly and noticed there that Jonne Welch,
our chief instructor, had had to land there I The wind
had grsatly increpsed on his return and Frank could only
nake 15 miles in returning before landing. Few others
fared much better. Sunday's task (the last) was a race
to Derby 'drome and back. Both I.C. men were unlucky in
starting and were still grounded when the early birds re-
turned, when things were really exciting.
The final placing put I.C. 12th in the team entries
and best of the 3 Olympia teams from Redhill. Lessons
learnt were that artificial horizons are good things,
efficient retrieving is vital, petrol is horribly expensive
and that task flying is immense fun.
The championship meteorologists were Dr. Serrer and
Mr. Ludlow of the Department of Meteorology, assisted by
three students. Their organization was first-rate and
made a breath-taking contribution tc the final party.
All things considered, I.C. was reasonably well to the
fore at Camphill.

R.C., I.C.B.C. being the other f i n a l i s t s . I n t h e i r
heat I.C. were drawn against I b i s and King's. A f t e r
l e a d i n g t o the Brook, I.C. were overtaken by I b i s ,
but managed to f i g h t back and lead by 3 f e e t . In
the f ' n a l , however, Lensbury l e d a l l the way and
won by 2 lengths.
The most obvious c r i t i c i s m i s that I.C. rowed
