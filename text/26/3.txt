EATING IN
For years the refectory losses have been steadily
mounting until last year they reached the astron-
omical figure of £5000 per annum. Clearly this could
not continue. To meet the situation an external
catering firm, John Gardner, who were successfully
running refectories at U.C. and Goldsmiths were
asked to take over the management of our refectory.
The present financial position, as reflected i n
the accounts recently presented, is most encouraging
and has fully justified the Refectory Committee's
action in calling in an external firm of managers.
The quality of the meals, while not being outstand-
ing, i s probably as good as can be expected for the
cost and is as high as that prevailing under prev-
ious regimes.
A praiseworthy attempt to improve the atmosphere
at supper has been made with the introduction, three
weeks ago, of a waitress service. This started badly,
improved slowly, and i s now accepted as almost
established. Unfortunately, the Lower Dining Room
with i t s service counter dominating one end does not
lend itself to a restaurant atmosphere.
The main objection is the effect on the cost of
living index which is rising of i t s own accord'with-
out any additional help from the refectory.
To sum up :- the idea seems a good one but the
limitations Imposed by pocket, and premises must be
borne in mind.
YOU,YOU,a YOU.
Anyone who ha3 ever thought of helping FELIX
should get i n touch with us. No experience i s nec-
essary, but a l i t t l e spate time, and the need f o r
an opportunity to l e a r n to write are the best qual
i f i c a t i o n s .
A r t i c l e s , l e t t e r s , reviews, and cartoons are
e s p e c i a l l y welcome from contributors who have not
the time f o r the routine of the Board, and the \
E d i t o r would be pleased to meet prospective cor- ;
respondents.
The FELIX typing problem has been p a r t i a l l y
solved by the kind assistance of the London College
of S e c r e t a r i e s , but we desperately need a t y p i s t to
help us at the f o r t n i g h t l y Sunday make-up meetings.
The work i s paid and i n t e r e s t i n g ; and the FELIX
Secretary and the A s s i s t a n t News E d i t o r are a v a i l -
able as chaperones.

One of the more/less* deplorable repercussions
of the s o c i a l and t e c h n o l o g i c a l upheaval that
started i n the l a t t e r h a l f of the 18th Century
and culminated i n the 1851 E x h i b i t i o n , was the
Royal School of Mines. To the catalogue of
catastrophes thrown up on the wake of the Indus-
t r i a l Revolution - the Napoleonic Wars, the Reform
B i l l of 1832, the Repeal of the Corn Laws i n 1846
- was added, i n 1851, the foundation of the Govern-
ment School of Mines and of science Applied to tne
A r t s .
Henry Thomas De l a Beche (1796-1855), l a s t
male descendant of a member of W i l l i a m the Con-
queror's Expeditionary Force, and one of the
e a r l i e s t f e l l o w s of the then r e c e n t l y founded
Geological Survey i n 1832, worked i n d e f a t i g a b l y
for the foundation of a college of mining tech»
nology. His chance came when he secured support
of the Prince Consort, and the Royal Commissioners
of the E x h i b i t i o n of 1851 r e a l i s e d a surplus of
over £200,000 (0 Tempora, 0 tores'.). The Govern-
ment School was opened i n Jermyn Street on Kover.ber
6th 1851, and the education of the troglodytes
began.
The task was one of uncommon d i f f i c u l t y and
De l a Beche had to e n l i s t the a i d of the heaviest
a v a i l a b l e guns - P l a y f a i r (Chemistry), Ramsay
(Geology), Forbes (Palaeontology), Warington
Smyth (Mining) and Hunt (Kechanical Science) -
and two years l a t e r of the Royal College of
Chemistry, which had been founded i n 1845. De
l a Beche was succeeded by S i r Roderick Sturchison,
from the l i g h t of pure science.
The School was removed,piecemeal fashion,
to the Huxley B u i l d i n g i n South Kensington between
1872 and 1880 and was there renamed "The Normal
(from 1890 "She Royal") School of Science and the
Royal School of Mines", under the D i r e c t o r s h i p of
T.H.Huxley. Dr. Percy, then i n charge of metallurgy
resigned rather than remove and was succeeded by
Prof. Roberts-Austin. Warington Smyth remained at
Jermyn Street u n t i l h i s death 1890, when the Mining
Department passed to Le Keve Foster and the Huxley
Building,.
In 1907 the Boardiof Education gave up
the unequal fight. The troglodytes,incurably
"nasty,brutish and short"(Hobbes) were care-
fully separated from the R.C.S.;the City and
Guilds College were thrown in to increase the
average density and I.C. was granted i t s
Charter. By 1913 the quarantine buildings,
erected for the Miners in Prince Consort Rd,
were complete and a proper segregation ach-
eived. Senescence set in. The R.S.M. grew
old, faithfullj tended and cared for by the
R.C.S. and the C. and 0.
Eut i t is feared/hoped*that a severe
and perhaps fatal centenary will develop
before Felix goes to Press and the author-
ities are taking appropriate precautions.
A service of commemoration at Holy
Trinity was held yesterday.
