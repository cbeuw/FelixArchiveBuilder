MESSERS BROWS A BROWNER
S i r - I support your correspondent's request f o r
a club f o r those who would j o i n " i f only they
had the time." The t i e design i s most e f f e c t i v e ,
but such an exclusive club should have a badge as
w e l l . would submit the f o l l o w l n g _ d e s l j n : -
Ajg EASTER REVIEW
Seated on a c h a i r , In f r o n t , i s a student,
stagnant, holding a book, rampant, the whole
biased. Above the arms of the club, the axe of
the examiner crossed w i t h the i r o n rod of d i s -
c i p l i n e ; below i s the club motto "Per Ardua ad
S c l e n t i a . " The background of the badge i s a
white fog, and the edge a brown halo.
Yours a b s t r a c t e d l y , "Browning."

The annual orgy of freshers' teas now being
over we can probably assume that, apart from the
p e r i o d i c a l exhortations of ' F e l i x ' the 'brown-
bagger' , t e n - t o - f i v e r ' or what have you, w i l l now
be allowed to f o l l o w the road to h i s own destruc-
t i o n unchecked.
However, there i s a category of student un-
considered by the exponents of the 'work hard and
play hard' school of oratory but which i s u s u a l l y
included i n the term 'brown-bagger', namely - the
'green-ticketer'.
This man, h i s face pasty through the hours
spent underground, h i s body bruised by the pummel-
l i n g s of rush-hour crowds, spends a large part of
his time and grant i n the d a i l y trek to and from
the c o l l e g e . He i s a phenomenon p e c u l i a r to the
U n i v e r s i t y of London. His i s the task of p a t t i n g
a" quart into a h a l f - p i n t pot f o r which he.has" '.
the consolation of knowing that time spent i n the
bus queue keeps him i n contact w i t h the everyday
world u n l i k e the unfortunate inmates of such
sheltered nurseries as Oxford and Cambridge.
The only s o l u t i o n i s f o r I.C. to become a
completely r e s i d e n t i a l college and t h i s should be
the declared aim of the Governing Body. I t i s
obviously a long term view and one which none of
us can hope to see achieved; but a more vigorous
attempt to increase h o s t e l accomodation than has
been shown i n the past w i l l at l e a s t provide hope
for the next generation.
Yours e t c . , 'Halang'.
SCOTTISH COUNTRY DANCING
19th Oct.51
S i r - I have with regret noticed the discontinuation
t h i s year of the weekly S c o t t i s h Country Dance
evenings,which Ashley Bean introduced i n the new
lounge l a s t year with considerable success. I
Imagine that the records usee to provide the m a l e
must s t i l l be i i . existence and i t i s a p i t y to l e t
them l i e idle.There does not seem to be any reason
for not r e s t a r t i n g these evenings,at any rate
for the t r i a l period of a term;there must be many
who,like m y s e l f , l i k e to do some of these dances by
â€¢ay of a change.
I do most s i n c e r e l y urge the Intertainments
Committee's early consideration of these suggestions
Yours etc,J.S.Johnston.
The chairman of the Entertainments Committee r e p l i e s :
Sir-She Scottish Dancing enthusiasts have not been
f o r g o t t e n . l t was our i n t e n t i o n to s t a r t weekly
dances beginning on October 12th. but we have been
handicapped by not having anywhere to meet. WB are
now hoping to bring the records from retirement
sometime I n November.

Dear S i r ,
The Imperial College Dramatic Society have
asked us to i n v e s t i g a t e the p o s s i b i l i t y of s t a g i n g
a revue next E a s t e r . Consequently we wish to assess
the support that such a venture would r e c e i v e .
. We believe that i n I.C. l i e s the enthusiasm
and a b i l i t y necessary to make t h i s sound and
p r a c t i c a l p r o p o s i t i o n . Is t h i s not an answer to
those who are of the opinion that I.C. has a
'middle-aged' complex?
Already a framework i s i n existence and a l l
i t needs i s the m a t e r i a l t o f i l l i t . We are a s k i n g
your readers to volunteer a c t i v e support as soon
as p o s s i b l e . What we want are ideas, s c r i p t s ,
music, and personal t a l e n t both f o r solo and group
items. We would l i k e anyone Interested to contact
us p e r s o n a l l y , by l e t t e r or through your columns.
We are sure that ouch a novel venture w i l l
soon receive the support i t r e q u i r e s .
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,

Ths t r a g i c passing of the Rector's Lawn.
No more w i l l merry students f r o l i c there
Nor any homely phrases f i l l the a i r
As j a v e l i n , discus, badly sent
Finds haven i n the foot of some o l d gent.
Chile sacrea t u r f i s heaved i n mould'ring heap

It would'nt be so bad i f on the s i t e
They'd r a i s e a place where we could drink a l l night.
But no. T h e y ' l l b u i l d an ugly frowning mass
For work-the downfall of the drinking c l a s s .

This i s an understatement. Let us be g r a t e f u l

for the work he and they must have done to
produce so good a performance.

F i o r d l l i g i and Dorab e l l s were sung by I s a b e l
Faulkner and E l i z a b e t h Cooper; and Ferrando and
Qugliemo by Bryan C o r r l e and Dennis Fry.
I was not able to hear the whole of the
Act, but what I d i d hear brought home to me and,
I am sure, to everyone i n the audience, that
here were seven people who knew what things they
ought to do w i t h t h i s l o v e l y work and d i d them.
They a l l d i d Juatloa to the beauty of the
music and to the w i t and sparkle of the l i b -

enjoyed the o r i g i n a l I t a l i a n l i b r e t t o but I do
not believe I t f i t t e d the music, the characters
or the s i t u a t i o n s as does t h i s E n g l i s h trans-

The piano part, having been cooked up from
the o r c h e s t r a l score, I s not easy, but, i n the
hands of a g i f t e d musician, i t had the l i f e , the
glow and the g a i e t y that Mozart would have
wished.
