PROFILE - P i n t stiffITHS
It was with j;reat d i f f i c u l t y that our s p a c l a l
correspondents managed to gain an audience with
David G r i f f i t h s . Despite the pressing demands of
the Royal School of Mines Centenary, the great man
spared us a few moments. From what he s a i d we
gathered that he was born at an early age i n the
once peaceful town of Sunbury. he was christened
David (a Welsh name, although he i s of E n g l i s h
descent) ana a f t e r an undistinguished school
career marked only by n o t o r i e t y , he misguidely
spent 18 months a t Bourne Polytechnic which he then
deserted f o r the Army. David's e f f i c i e n c y i n keeping
the Jews and Arabs apart i n P a l e s t i n e , and h i s s k i l -
f u l handling of Egyptian donkeys during h i s 4 year
m i l i t a r y career r a i s e d him to the unprecedented
height o f Captain.
David came to the R.S.M. i n 1948, and immedia-
t e l y d i s t i n g u i s h e d himself by a,short speech and an
even shorter yard (10.2 seoonds)fat the Freshers'
Dinner. In s p i t e of h i s s l i g h t weakness f o r beer
he proved to be a very capable hockey player,
becoming secretary o f the R.S.M. Hockey Club f o r the
50-'51 season. The e a r l i e r part of Saturdays he dev-
oted to playing rugger f o r h i s Old Boys side.Unfor-
tunately the Mines rugger club has been unable t o
undermine h i s a l l e g i a n c e t o the hockey club on
Wednesdays. Since h i s recent vacation i n Canada he
has, however, been converted to baseball, which i t
i s f e l t w i l l c o n f l i c t somewhat with h i s hockey.
He s t i l l manages, despite the demands of the
R.S.M. Centenary, t o maintain h i s carefree e x t e r i o r
an a t t i t u d e which, a t school, earned him the name
''Sunshine". Likewise h i s term of o f f i c e as p r e s i -
dent of the R.S.M. during the forthcoming year w i l l
doubtless cast no shadowy e f f e c t . His e f f i c i e n c y
and leadership have already made themselves appar-
ent although the former q u a l i t y had previously been
proved when he f i l l e d the post of secretary of the
R.S.M. union f o r the year '50-'51.
Although i t i s only early i n the new term, he \
i s already proving t o be a very popular and w e l l -
l i k e d President. The unsuspected q u a l i t i e s o f d i p l -
omacy were revealed i n h i s handling of t h i s years'
Mines* Freshers Dinner.
Unlike the majority of Miners, David professes
a keen i n t e r e s t i n a r t , l i t e r a t u r e and music. The
l a t t e r i s shown by h i s ' ' p r o g r e s s i v e " compositions
on the g u i t a r . His a b i l i t y to charm the weaker sex
i s , o f course, already w e l l known - t h i s i s accred
i t e d to h i s magnificent " f r o t h - f i l t e r " .
In conclusion we should l i k e to express our
appreciation of the good work he Is doing, and
wish him continued success i n each of h i s many
f i e l d s of a c t i v i t y .
T H E F R E S H E R S R E C E P T I O N S
These have taken place i n the Union on succetive
Fridays since the beginning of the term, beginning
with the R.C.S. on the 5th. October, and followed by
C. and G. on the 12th., and the R.S.M. on the 19th.
The R.C.S. were honoured by the presence of the
Rector, S i r Roderic H i l l . In h i s speech he emphasis-
ed that the purpose of a U n i v e r s i t y education was "
not only t o extract l e a r n i n g from the College, but
also one must endeavour t o leave one's mark by
putting something into the corporate l i f e of the
community''.
The receptions a l l followed s i m i l a r l i n e s with
speeches oy d i s t i n g u i s h e d quests and Union o f f i c i -
a l s , toasts proposed and answered. The speeches
usually praised the College and i t s students, and
exhorted the l a t t e r not to brownbag. .
.
The Union Presidents attended each others'
functions, presumably to obtain f i r s t - h a n d inform-
a t i o n of. any slanderous statements. There were no
r e c i p r o c a l arrangements with I.C.W.A.
A deplorable trend was noticed among the f r e s h -
ers. Quite early i n the evening they began p o l i t e l y
r e f u s i n g the free beer offered to them, I t i s to be
hoped that t h i s unfortunate state of a f f a i r s w i l l
be remedied i n the near future. In s p i t e of preven-
t i n g the waste of beer that might have been caused
by t h i s trend, the older students remained remark-
ably sober, and many were seen walking home.
I.C.W.A., of course, were d i f f e r e n t . Their
reception was held on a Tuesday, the 16th., i n
t h e i r lounge, with no speeches and no beer.
POL L I T T
The J o i n t Freshers' tea of a L i t e r a r y and
Debating Society, with the P o l i t i c a l Society has
once again c a r r i e d o f f i t s annual confidence t r i c k
s u c c e s s f u l l y . The tea opened as usual t o the
s a t i s f y i n g sound of sandwiches being demolished,
and a f t e r a respectable time lapse, the chairman,
Mam Sobey, i n a nice soothing address staked h i s
c l a i m on the Fresher market and gave an o u t l i n e of
the P o l i t i c a l Society's aims and programme. Ke
was supported i n a more p a r t i s a n 3 p i r i t by the
chairman of the various sub-groups, but the aura
of i m p a r t i a l s t a b i l i t y was soon restored when the
President o f the L i t e r a r y and Debating Society,
Ted Simon, discussed the r e l a t i v e merits of the
bar and the S o c i e t y as a means of s e l f - e x p r e s s i o n .
He mentioned a l s o the Society's d e s i r e t o supple-
ment the time-honoured Bedford Debates by arrang-
ing f u r t h e r debates with R.C.A. and R.C.M., and
by cleaning up the U.L.U. championships.
Having lulled i t s audience into a pleasing sense of
security the Chair then l i t the fuse of the big gun by
introducing Professor Levy who had consented for the twen-
tieth Tea to deliver the blow intended to shatter the com-
placency of his audience. In typical style Prof. Levy
opened "I am not going to be political, I am not going to
be provocative, I am going to talk about Russia." He went.,
on to describe a v i s i t he had made, as one of a delegation,
to Russia, and particularly to Uzbekistan in Soviet Asia.
His main purpose, i t seemed was to point out the tremendous
effort being made in Russia towards the raising of their
.economic standards. He mentioned as an example the enor-
mous university Just built outside Moscow on the1
Lenin Hills,
with hostel accommodation for 6,600 of the total 10,000
student population. He remarked particularly on the fine
flats provided for staff.
As an argument against those who allege Soviet
aggressive plans, he spoke of the apparent absence of good
roads across the major part of the country, a remark vhich
got him into trouble with Dai Nicholas afterwards, who
flatly stated that good roads to the frontier were not
necessary for an aggressive war.
- As Tony Peacock said i n his vote of thanks to Profes-
sor Levy there was nothing left for anyone to say so we
passed out and were received by the cool night a i r .
