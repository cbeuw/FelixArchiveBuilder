MR. ALFRED STEPHENSON
— The Senior Warden
Mr. Alfred Stephenson has been the Senior Warden of the
College since the post was created two years ago. The term
'Senior Warden' has sinister connotations and it is unfortunate
that many students first encounter him in his role of dixiplin-
arian when the 'business of the day' is hardly conducive to an
amicable relationship. His responsibilities however, embrace
far wider horizons than the keeping of the peace. He sits on
all line Committees concerned with student welfare, being chair-
man of the Refectory Committee, and the Athletic Committee,
and vice-chairman of the Halls of Residence Committee, acting
as a 'puller together' of these various bodies. The non resident
students are his particular reponsibility, and it is his job to
see that the facilities provided by the expanding College cater
for their need as well as for the more fortunate, residents.
'Steve' was educated at King
Edward V I school in Norwich,
and St. Catherine's Cam-
bridge, whsfe he read Geo-
graphy and Surveying. A ke~n
• porisman, he played hockey
for his College, and was a
rowini enthusiast. He also
n'aved hockey f-T IC when he
first came to take up the: po^t
of Assistant Lecturer in 1937,
and has been the President of

I C H C since 1939. For several
vears now, he rr»s been Secret-
fairy of the Athletic Ground
Committee, which runs Harl-
ington.
As a boy, Sf
eve was a keen
member of the Scouting move-
ment, and loved camping.
These were the pursuits which
gave him the initial inspira-
tion for a life interest in
exploration and adventure; he
has taken part in several ex-
peditions, mostly to polar
regions, first in 1930 cn com-
ing down from Cambridge,
and most recently in 1960
when he accompanied Sir
Vivian Fuchs to the Antartic
A founder member of the IC
Exploration Board in 1957, he
is now the Boards chairman-
The three major expeditions in
which he took part before
coming to IC were to Green-
land. North West Canada, and
B-itish Grahfam Land in A n -
tartica, his main functions on
these trips being furveving
and climatology: he has ba
en
awarded the Polar Medal with
both Artie and Antartic
clasps. In 1936, he was in
off Graham Land when this
broke up during a storm. The
party managed to reach the
shelter of a rocky islet, but
were there for two weeks be*
fere they managed to return to
base "120 mph <gales can be
quite terrifying in the Antar-
tic." On his last trip South, his
ship, the Kista Dan was trapp-
ed in the ice for a fortnight,
with a ten degree list, while of
the more satisfying experienc-
es 'sledging up and down
valleys behind a really good
team of dogs is tremendous
fun and very exhilirating.'
During the war, he served
with this R A F and was C O . of
an air survey Interpretation!
Unit. In 1946, he was awarded
the O B E (Miliary). The fol-
lowing year, he was appointed
University Reader in-Survey-
ing at IC. Since the war, he
has been several times to
Canada and once to Thailand
to help in A i r Surveys.
As Senior Warden, Steve
receives all the complaints
about student behaviour out-
side the College, from the
proceedings at Marlborough
Street to dust-bin rolling in
Ennismore Mews. There are
examples of student ragging,
such as the Spanner on the
wall of Physics which he un-
officially applauds- Events
such as Morphy Day and
Guilds Field Cup Race are
fine opportunities for good
"sport'. However, these mob
outings usually get out of hand
due to the thoughtless beha-
viour of soma students who
often do considerable damage
and cause excessive inconven-
ience to other people. Better
iand more responsible organisa-
tion is called for on these
occasions. He deplores the in-
considerate behaviour of many
students and the attitude that
'doing damage is O.K. as long
as it is paid for'. Money can-
not repair the reputation of
the College. Steve is also con-
cerned with the bad behaviour
of some College teams on
away fixtures, and other part-
ies on works visits etc. Trophy
collecting can sometimes be
amusing but more often than
not, the 'stealing' of signs and
other sundry ornaments is a
stupid and costly affair.
The delays on South Side
are as infuriating to him as
they are to the students- He
looks forward to the expans-
ion of the Halls of Residence
and other student amendtie's.
Imperial College Hostels have
always been run with the
minimum of restrictions on
the residents. He hopes that it
will not be neccessary to im-
pose restrictive rules in the
new Halls, but it is up to the
inmates to behave themselves.
A large student community in
the centre of a residential area
must observe the accepted
codes of behaviour.
He is very much in favour
of the first degree course being
extended to four years to en-
able the undergraduates to
take part in non-academic
activities. The College is very
fortunate to have a large
number of postgraduates tak-
ing an active part in the Union
and their influence is extreme-
ly valuable in the well admini-
stered Union. He is confident
that the Union will be able to
cope with the additional
administration of South Side
facilities.
Steve has considerable ex-
perience of understanding and
'dealing' with young people
gained on his many expedi-
tions and from bringing up his
two Children who are now of
University age. He is a quiet
man who speaks deliberately,
considering each point care-
fully, never making rash
promises or attempting to
disguise his true opinion with
false sincerity. He is putting in
a tremendous amount of work
to make the new IC a place
where students will be educat-
ed to be more than just back
room scientists. Let w hope
that his efforts will not be in
vain.
