I.C.B.C VISIT LEANDER
CLUB
The Boat Club paid its annual
visit to Leander Club, the home
of British rowing, over the week-
end of the 9th-10th February.
This "Henley" weekend has
now come to be recognised as a
vital stage in the, winter training
programme and this year in par-
ticular, the first, second and third
VIIIs benefitted considerably
from the intensive coaching and
training, and from the inter-crew
rivalry.
An assorted collection of old
crocks left the College on Friday
lunchtime, and\ by 5.0 p.m. the
crews had completed seven miles
of preliminary paddling over the
relatively slow stream of the
Henley reach.
After an excellent dinner and
an early night, the crews were on
the water by 8.00 a.m. for a pre-
breakfast tune-up, and then again
at 11.0 for the main work of the
day. At this stage, the empha-
sis is put on long distance work
at average ratings, and all three
crews took advantage of the three
mile course to improve stamina
and technique in this manner. In
the summer term, the outings
tend to become shorter, with the
accent on higher ratings rather
than on mileage.
During the afternoon, the Ox-
ford Varsity boat was practising
on the same water, and several
correspondents were seen taking
note of the pre-seasonal form of
the IC eights. On the Sunday,
the river was again awakened
before breakfast, and before the
day was throueh each crew had
added a further twenty miles to
its log book.
Before departing from what
evervone agreed had been an
excellent weekend, the little excess
energy that remained was used
FELIX ANSWER TO THE
PPA.
Not to be outdone by the
PPA's decision to forecast results,
Felix's sports experts have turned
their gaze to some possible fix-
tures, and came up with some
unanimous decisions (it should
perhaps be explained that to pre-
vent controversy among the
panel of experts, their number
was fixed at ONE). Apart from
the standard result for most
games of " IC lose to C E M , " we
have the following :
Chandmallions 0, Sherwood
Foresters 8.
Finchfield Rangers 2, NUS
United 1.
Harris Casuals 0, ICWA Dyna-
moes 1.'
Liddlehampton 2, Spudfield
Miners 6.
(abandoned after 89 mins.)
Preecetown 3, Stacey Albion 3.
White City 0, Old Tyeonians 0.
for a snowball fight, and, need it
be said, chucking King in the
drink.
The first major event of the
year—the U.L. Head—has almost
arrived. The first eight look cer-
tain to retain the Dixon Bowl for
the fastest College crew over the
mile course. I.C. will be en-
tering all 9 crews for this event in
comparison to the one or two
boats entered by other colleges.
On the 16th March, four crews
will be entered for the Reading
Head. This race is an organisa-
tional masterpiece in which two-
hundred crews have to be herded
together before the race can even
start.
On the 23rd March all I.C.
crews will be rowing in the mam-
moth Putney Head. Practically
every club in the country is repre-
sented, and over three hundred
crews race over the reverse Boat
Race course. The club is hoping
for very encouraging results, and
in particular the promising
novice crews should be able to
gain about fifty places from
their contemporaries of 1962.

Swimming
Club
On Friday, February 15th
the IC Swimming Club re-
ceived as their vistors Cam-
bridge University Tadpoles
one of the most attractive fix-
tures of the season. With the
weakened team, IC did well
to hold Tadpoles to a narrow
33 - 27 win in the Swimming
match. Once again, the Coll-
ege duo of Hennesy and Coll-
ins showed their superiority
n the back-stroke event, gain*
ing maximum points as they
have done consistently this
year.
In the Water Polo match,
even without two members of
the regular team, IC were gen-
erally superior, winning by a
comfortable 5-1. This extend-
ed their unbeaten run to four
games in eight days. Although
no individual player was out-
tanding, the standard of team-
work, which has been poor in
recent weeks, was back to it's
usual form.
If this can be maintained,
the team should again finish
in a prominent position in
Division I of the University
League, and end the season
on a high note.
Cross Country
By the time this is in print,
the Hyde Park Relay will have
taken place. Considering that
most of the Universities take part,
I.C. did well to win the event
last season. However, only three
of the triumphant team remain
at college and on top of that in-
juries and illness have hampered
several of the club's top runners;
Ted Wilkins and Pete Roy, in
particular. Consequently, a new
winner this year is to be expected.
Apart from two cancellations,
fixtures have continued despite
the weather. Last term's pro-
gramme ended with the U L U
Champs in which I.C. came out
3rd in the team placing.
For the most part the courses
this term have either been
covered in snow or frozen up.
This has not made for easy run-
ning or fast times. Although two
or more teams often turn out on
one afternoon, there is still a lack
of first-rate runners. The result
is matches lost to Sandhurst,
Leeds, Met. Police, and R A F
Halton. Those matches won in-
clude Goldsmiths and Reading
(Home and Away).
Personal performances have
varied considerably. When free
from injury, Ted Wilkins con-
tinues as the club's leading run-
ner. Together with Jo Fitz-
simmons, the skipper " Link " is
going well on the roads. Chris
Jances seems to thrive on any-
thing from plough to marshes,
while over a fast course Howerd
Dickson and Frank Hobson per-
form creditably.
The position in League I is
particularly interesting as I.C. 1st
are fourth, onlv 80 points behind
Kina's on a tally of over 1,000. It
miaht be noted that amid the
confusion at the S.W.E.T.C.
meeting, Chris James knew the
correct course, stuck to it, and
earned himself a silver pot even
though the race was declared
void.
Golf
A practice net has been er-
ected in one of the fives
courts opposite Week's Hall,
Princes Gardens. It will be
available to all members of
the College and it is hoped to
have professional tuition
classes on Tuesdays and
Thurdays at lunchtime. Clubs
and balls for these will be
made available.
Anyone interested in either
tuition or private use of the
net should put his name on the
Golf Association noticeboard
at the bottom of the stairs near
Ithe Union bar.

The record of the Imperial
College Exploration Society
roust be just about supreme
among University Exploring
groups for the number and
diversity of the expeditions it
has supported—fifteen in the
last three years. Although this
is no doubt due in large
measure to the encouragement
and support (not only financial)
of the College through the
Exploration Board, this should
in no way be allowed to
detract from the sucess of the
Society.
Last week, the Society held
art exhibition in the Upper
Lounge of the Union to show
to members of the Union some
of the results of its efforts.
There were bugs from ihe West
Indies, skins and rugs from
Ethiopia, and amphora from
beneath the Mediterranean,
and photos from all parts of
the globe. North to Spitz-
bergen, south to Antartica,
(though I did not know of an
expedition to this part of the
world) west to St. Kitts and
east to Kashmir. Despite the
wide variety of the expedi-
tions, it was disappointing to
see that two thirds of the
exhibition were occupied by
underwater swimming and
artic exploration. Perhaps this
was due to a lack of exhibits
from Kashmir, Ghana, Ice-
land, etc.. as the members of
these expeditions have now
mostly left College.
The exhibition appeared to
have been designed to show to
members of the College (and
to representatives of various
benefactors) what had been
attempted and achieved by the
last expeditions. Thus we saw
botanical specimens, zoological
collections, maps, papers etc.
produced by the expeditions in
addition to the fine collection
of photographs.
To an ex-member of an
expedition, it was a disappoint-
ment that there was so little
of the results of previous
experience—especially in the
way of food and equ'pment
that had been tried and tested
in the field. A good opportuni-
ty was lost here to give the
members of this year's expedi-
tions muoh useful knowledge,
even though most of it can
be obtained through the Socie-
ty by other means.
