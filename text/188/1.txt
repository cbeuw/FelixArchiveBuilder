Refectory.
The meeting opened, the minutes were read and then corrected ;
this latter task took an exceedingly long time and it was pointed
out to the observers that this lengthy process was very unusual, since
the Secretary (and not Mrs. Robb) had taken the minutes. Mr.
Phillips realised this and went to great pains to right the wrongs
the minutes had suffered. A letter from a Mr. Berry was read to
Council expressing his appreciation of the troubled arrangements
of the last Union Meeting and of the " ineptitude" (translation :
incompetence) of the Executive in this respect. This was noted by
a silent, cowed Council which proceeded swiftly to business.
Dr. Weale explained the latest
state of the finances. After this
Mr. Phillips brought up the ques-
tion of R C A students using our
gymnasium. There ensued a
lively discussion in which we
heard the opinion that facilities
for our own students were inade-
quate ; on the other hand, R C A
only wanted to use the changing
rooms—said the placid Welsh-
man. So, despite fears that this
might be the thin end of a very
much larger wedge, Council de-

'The Spirit drove Jesus into
the wilderness- A n d he was in
the wilderness forty days
tempted of Satan'. For Christ-
ians the season of Lent—the
40 days from Ash Wednesday
(Feb. 27th) to Ho'y Saturday
(April 13th) is a ti-ne of Trac-
ing in the Faith. With ou-
Lord we Pray, we Fast, and
we Act so that we can be les
unworthy servants of His.
Please try to follow these
simple suggestions:
1) Private prayer to be regular,
morning and evening. Do not
let this slip.
2) Bible reading weekly if not
daily- The Gospel for the com-
inci Sunday in the New Eng.
Bible is a good idea.
3) Regular attendance at the
altar each Snndav. Tt is' a
grave sin to fail to be present
at the altar each Sundav,
except under very serious cir-
cumstances.
4) 'Loyalty to the life and
witness of the church in &i<°.
college. Personal fads and
fancies don't count here.
5) Some regular practice of
self-denial. Doing without a
meal or smoking or drinking
on Wed. and Fri. is good.
6) Almsgiving. The money
from your self denial—and
this ought not to be less than
5 shillings a week—ought to
go towards the church. This
should be extra to, not instead
of your regular Sunday offer-
ing-
7) A n honest attempt each
week, to talk to some non-
church goer about our Holy
Faith, and to pray for, and
bring that person to churcn
with you.
