eided to let in the RCA students.
This incident was minor com-
pared to the " scandalous " affair
of the £12 involved in the A C C
sherry party. The Chairman of
the RCA, Mr. Haclin, protested
vehemently about the financial
situation of the R C C and con-
trasted his austerity measures
with this apparent extravagance
of the ACC. Mr. Phillips (what
would Council be without him ?
one wonders) surmounted the ob-
stacle of the sympathy aroused
by Mr. Haclin retaliating : " This
is a Good Thing." Officials of
ACC clubs would be able to meet
the many staff members who take
an active interest in sport in the
College. Eventually the Phillips'
patent stubborn rearguard action
resulted in an exasperated Coun-
cil passing on to the next busi-
ness.
The Executive report revealed
that Messrs. Finch and Pearson
had together approached the
Rector about obtaining addi-
tional finances for our proposed
affiliation to NUS. The Rector
stipulated that they be accom-
panied by the President. None-
theless, their attempt to bypass the
Execuive was condemned
strongly by Council.
Various reports were then sub-
mitted to Council stating that
plans for the Sports Centre are
progressing slowly ; Felix is los-
ing money due to falling sales ;
Phoenix sold 900 copies, losing
£50 which, it is hoped, will be
partly or wholly recovered by the
second issue; the Square and
Folk Dancing Group is now a
fully-Hedged Club ; conditions at
Silwood continue to be hopelessly
inadequate — especially when
visited by Touchstone parties;
the Bookstall needs room to ex-
pand and several schemes are
under discussion.
A career

worth
If you divide the population into two groups — those
who take T H E TIMES and those who don't—you find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are in the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top in their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority in experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you
place yourself?

After a few more reports
Council moved on to A.O.B.—
forty people wish to form a Flat
Earth Society, whose aims are to
" SEEK T H E TRUTH." ex-
plained Mr. Harris. This Society
would be for people who know
" what's what." However, the
aims of the Society had not been
published on the Union Notice
Board so Council could do noth-
ing about it at that time. This
did not prevent Mr. Pearson from
exclaiming joyfully that the pro-
posed society would probably
come under the SCC.
A petition, bearing over 200
signatures had been received call-
ing on Council to convene an
Extraordinary General Meeting
to reconsider the decision of the
last Union Meeting concerning
NUS. The petition expressed dis-
satisfaction with the conduct of
the meeting and raised doubts as
to the validity of the marginal
majority.
The President then justified his
action in speaking at the end of
the meeting for the notorious 45
seconds. Council Members
vented their feelings with varying
degrees of acerbity. " Your
crimes, Mr. President, are two-
fold," declared Mr. Gardiner
sternly. " No excuse," said Mr.
Oldfield. Mr. White was
" shocked and surprised." Mr.
Phillips declared that it was " dis-
graceful." Mr. Austin thought it
" deplorable." Mr. Pearson be-
lieved that Council's grapes were
a little sour. The diatribe con-
tinued, while the President clung
firmly to his justification of
Assent and Precedent ; when it
came to the point, Council de-
clined to censure him for his
action.
Inevitably tension gave way to
anticlimax. Mr. Jenkins chewed
a large bone of discontent, assert-
ing that the voting system used
last time was farcical, and urged
Council to find a fairer method.
Some suggested a referendum,
while others considered that the
meeting should take the form of
a debate ; even compromise was
mentioned. Eventually ythe Exe-
cutive was left to decide the rele-
vant date, location, voting sys-
tem, everything else and . . . so
to bar.

The Musical Society in co-
operation with the Dramatic
Society gave 'Pirates of Pen-
zance' as their annual Gilbert
and Sullivan offering last week.
'The Pirates' is perhaps not
the best thing that that curious
pair threw together, and the
plot and score do not stand
too close a scrutiny, but there
are many things in it which
combined to produce an enjoy-
able evening last week-
One of the delights of
theatre going is to see pretty
girls doing graceful things in-
stead of the plain trivia of
everyday life General Stanley's
numerous daughters bear so
little relation to the plot that
this must be ther raisom d'etre,
land they filled the bill admir-
ably. Indeed, I would have
been more than content if Gil-
bert had thrown in a scene
devoted to a static appraisal
of their charms.
With a natural generosity of
thought and action, William
James gave us a really splen-
did Pirate King. This part
demands a fine strong voice
with a commanding presence
and a strong comic sense. Bill,
of home grown IC stock, has
the lot, and knows how to use
them.
The orchestra were pretty
solid, with some very good
plaving from flutes and cellos.
This was a production well
up to the annual standard
which fully deserved the good
sized audiences it drew.
