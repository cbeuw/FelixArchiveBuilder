would encourage every Union
member to vote, as it would not
be necessary to waste, say, one
and a half hours listening to a
generally boring debate before
voting.
I cannot see any objection to
this suggestion on administrative
grounds. The only possible ob-
jection to this can be that a lot
of people will be voting on a
matter they know little about.
This is, however, unavoidable, if
a genuinely democratic decision is
to be reached. In any case, as
described previously, people were
voting in the last meeting without
hearing the arguments expressed
in the actual debate. In addition,
the NUS issue has been so well
publicised that almost every
Union member must be aware of
the main arguments for and
against, and must consequently he
in a posit'on to come to a respon-
sible decision.
In conclusion, I must point out
that I would not advocate such a
referendum to decide every issue.
The bitter controversy, the total
snlit in the Union Council, and
the fact that most Union members
will be able to come to a respon-
sible decision without hearing
another debate on the subject,
make this issue an exception and
one on which I regard the deci-
sion of the whole Union to be
essential.
Yours faithfully,
T. W. WHEELER,

GLIDING
CLUB
— from C Mingo
The weather has stopped
flying since Christmas, and
members must envy Frank Ir-
ving who is representing the
Club at the World Champion-
ships in the Argentine.
The summer is full of expec-
tations—we shall have at least
three Club members in the
National Championships,
whils the less experienced will
pit their skill against the might
of the Cambridge Team.
Later on, the Club is trans-
feiiing operations to the sunny
Alpine Passes to show the local
Italian peasants how the mad
dogs of IQnen fly high in the
mid-day sun. The expedition
is hoping to return more or
less sober and intact after a
month, hoping to find that our
home based team has made its
mark in local soaring rallies
Indeed, whatever the weath-
er, at the end of the summer,
every self-raspecing club mem-
ber should find himself well
and truly flat broke-

Dear A. L.
I have recently acquired a
sum of money. Could you sug-
gest a worthy investment!—
IC student-
Dear I C
I suggest that you support the
Charity Carnival. May 6th-
11th.
Dear A. L-
My girl friend often hints
that she prefers men with
beards. Unfortunately my chin
is incapable of supporting sttch
a growth. As I know that you
have a beard yourself, I was
wondering if you could help
me. — A young shaver.
Dear Shaver,
Consult the 'Demon Barter'
who could supply you with a
novel solution. It will tickle
her pink.
Dear A. L-
I have recently traced my
father to IC. How can I re-
cognise himl—'Son of Alison'.
Dear Son,
Buy a packet of 'Players'.
Dear A. L>
I am an architect working
on a project in Princes Gar-
dens- I am getting older and
may soon be on the shelf. How
can I remedy this"?—Harassed.
Dear Harassed,
In the words of Uncle Phil,
'Get your finger out'.
Dear A. L.
I am worried about my per-
sonality. My friends regard it
as a false front. What should
I do"? — Your bosom friend-
Dear B F.,
This is a problem of inflation.
Try and get it off your chest.
Dear A. L.
As captain of the ICWA
Chesterfield Rugby Club, I
was not invited to the ACC
Sherry party. Am I a wall-
flower? — Blodwen.
Dear Blodwen,,
Don't worry—Lloyd George
wasn't invited either. Auntie
Lope is considering starting a
'Missing Persons' and 'Un-
claimed Monies' column. A l l
missing persons and any un-
claimed money should be sent
to A L. c/o F E L I X .
A permanent commission in the Technical
Branch of the Royal.Air Force is a career
•with many advantages. On the one hand
you have the attractive life of an R.A.F.
officer: good pay, world-wide travel, the
high standard of living and easy com-
panionship that goes with membership of
the Officers' Mess. On the other, your
work is absorbing and varied. As a tech-
nical officer, your qualifications—as an
electrical or mechanical engineer—will be
used in a great variety of appointments.
You could have direct responsibility for
the serviceability of aircraft with a flying
squadron, or for modern weapons systems
as a station electrical officer. You could
become part of the team responsible for
maintaining world-wide R.A.F. commun-
ications, or carry out experimental work
at a Research and Development Unit.
Joining as a qualified man
As a qualified engineer with a degree,
or a comparable qualification, you will
be given special terms of appointment:
an immediate Permanent commission
with up to years seniority: this guar-
antees a pensionable career to the age of
with prospects of rising to the most
senior ranks in the Royal Air Force.
Alternatively you may choose a shorter
pensionable commission to the age of 3
8
(or for 1
6 years, whichever is the longer),
or you may apply for a short service
engagement which entitles you to a
generous tax-free gratuity on completion.
Post graduate training
During your service you will have the
chance oftaking post graduate courses lead-
ing to advanced specialist qualifications,
for example the Diploma of the College
of Aeronautics at Cranfield and the
DiplomaoftheUniversity ofSouthampton.
Few careers are so worthwhile—or offer
so many opportunities as a commission
in the Technical Branch of the Royal Air
Force. For full information, write, giving
your date of birth, experience and details of
education and qualifications, to Group Captain
