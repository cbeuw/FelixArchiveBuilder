Where are they? Where are the missing Carnival Queans9
We see lots of possible nominees every day of the week—but
nobody writes to us and tells us about them. People are always
grumbling about the relative scarcity of the fair sex at 1. C.
We agree it's problem—but now you have the perfect excuse
to get to know at least one member of the genus ICWarius.
Just walk up to her, notebook at he ready, and announce
purposefully; "Excuse me, I should like to nominate you for
Carnival Queen". Her reaction will be one of delight, although
she will probably disguise this under a cloak of maidenly
modesty. The course you adept for the ret of te investiga-
tion is left entirely to you; but don't forget to send the finished
nomination to Graham B White at the Carnival office (or via
the Union Rack).
P.S. We have decided to
extend the list of those el:
gibb
to include all nonacademic
(female) members of the Col-
lege, so your scope for select-
ion is even wider; but we have
decided not to allow fiances,
girls friends, etc. from out ide
the college to' be eligible. We
are not setting up in opposit-
ion to the Miss World contest
—at least, not this year!
right in their own particular
fields—but if its the big
readership you're after, there's
no doubt about it—you should
write for S T Y N X A l l material
—jokes, cartoons, but especial-
ly stories—to the Editor,
please, by the end of this
month.

In order to accumulate. A n d
the rewards for indulging in a
bit of speculation on the
Carnival Raffle are increasing
rapidly. In response to the
ceaseless flow of begging letters
from our indefatigable secre-
taries, many promises of prizes
are being received. Tho:e so
far promised include beer-beer
some more beer—not to ment-
ion sherry, etc.—cigarettes (In-
cidentally, don't forget that
Carnival would be grateful to
receive your Embassy Gift
Vouchers to help swell the
Rtock of prizes) and quite an
assortment of other prizes. So
the rickets you will be selling
at Easter will represent a
pretty promising investment;
and while you're about it, whv
not speculate a little yourself!

By showing that, at I. C. at
least, we have learnt to bridge
the cultural chasm. Write a

In fact you'll be seeing theim
—or rather the results of thur
efforts—pretty well all over the
place at Carnival time. Who?
The commandos, of course!
Nearly forty were present at
the meeting last week, and
between them they cooked up
quite a few schemes for rar-
ing money and for telling Lon-
don; possibly even the whole
country; the glad n?ws that
I.C. Carnival is here again. It
would not be "in the National
interest"—to use a popular
phrase—to reveal details of all
the schemes put forward—but
we can slay that plans are
being made for a Chariot R a c ,
which it is hoped will be held
round Rotten Row. If you
idle, please let us know; in any
case we hope that film com-
panies and the like will be
forthcoming. It is not impos-
sible that four august college
persoriagesmay be askeid to
take part; whether for pulling
or driving has yet to be decid-
ed. (Any comments, M~ssrs.

It was suggested that some

can be given. Mystery!
know anyone with a couple of
Bem-Hur type chariots lying
A scheme about which more
can be said is an assault on
the minimum tims-taken-to-
visit - all - the - stations - on-the-
Underground record- The pre-
sent record is held by an - l i
established University higher
up the Thames with the time;
which our planners tell is
laughably long; of 18 hrs 39
minutes. It will be appreciated
that such an attempt needs a
lot of planning, and we also
need several cars—with fast,
reliable drivers—to transfer
the record-breakers from ter-
minus to terminus. Offers of
help would be very gratefully
received at the Carnival Office.
While on the subject of
Commandos—hew a b o u t
some from the second, third
and post-grad- years? A l l the
volunteers so far have been
freshers, and while we are
pleased to see) young blood on
the job, we can't really under-
stand the lack of support from
older years. We can use just
as many as we can get—so
let's be hearing from you, com-
mandos.

P S G B W has promised Car-
naval Queen-
International
Students
Club
For Felix
It will be here again!
The London International
Student's Club (LISC) will be
functioning from July to egrly
September this yerar. After
the great success of last year,
the club will be more ambit-
ous, and entertain students on
Tuesdays. Thursdays and
Saturdays. The entertainments
take the form of films, dances,
talks by prominent psrsonqlit-
ies, tours of Lordon and the
country, etc.
The success of the Club can
be measured by the number of
students who used it's facilit-
ies last year. There were some
348 members from 35 differ-
ent countries, most of them
from the Scandinavian countr-
ies. We are now in contact
with other similar student org-
anisations in Sweden, Den-
mark, and Germany, and Nor-
wegian students want to start
a similar scheme for their stu-
dent visitors.
The Club is completely non-
"proflt making, and is run by
students for all students. Any-
one interested in joining or
helping with the running of this
Club this summer, should get
in touch with: —
R. Law, Room 69 Beit Hail.
