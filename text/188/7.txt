During the week February 3rd to 10th, Father Bernard, a Fran-
ciscan friar, and his team of Campaigners, have been living in this and
other neighbouring colleges. Their presence has certainly not gone by
unnoticed, for it was not only their unusual attire which was so
refreshingly different, but their whole attitude and outlook upon
life ! They set a stimulating example to everyone who was in the
least bit interested. The Campaign programme was so extensive
that I cannot go into it in great detail, but I hope that this short
article will at least plot the greatest peaks on its graph of achieve-
ment.
I doubt if anyone who attended
Father Dennis' Tuesday General
Studies Lecture " On Being a
Christian To-day " will forget it
very quickly ; not for what was
said on matters of belief, but for
the overriding impression of sin-
cere liberalism and sympathetic
understanding of the modern
world. Later, one curious sceptic
told me that he had gone to the
lecture expecting to find a ram-
pant fanatic. What he did in
fact find was a man he could ad-
mire. The greatest onus was
brilliantly borne by the leader,
Father Bernard, who on the Mon-
day, Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings spoke on " The Faith "
to about 150 who filled the Snack
Bar where the talks were given.
Dealing with human and spiritual
relationships, with the life of
Christ, the meaning of the
Church and Christian disciple-
ship ; he seemed to be confront-
ing many men and women of
widely varying requirements with
the impossible. In the opinion
of those who heard him, he
sounded convincingly true. The
second General Studies lecture,
which was given by Father Hugh
on Thursday, was not very well
attended since it clashed with
the NUS Debate. The audience
of 30 or so who did attend heard
a very penetrating treatment of
the subject of Prayer.
On the Thursday evening five
men from Imperial College were
presented to the Bishop for the
Sacraments of Confirmation and
First Communion. This service
took place in the University
Chaplaincy Church for students
in West London—-St. Augustine's
Church in Queen's Gate. A large
congregation of students were
present at this moving service to
strengthen and encourage the
five men who had thus committed
themselves to the Faith of the
Gospel and to a lifetime of
Christian discipleship. After the
service a party took place in the
Union Snack Bar, where beer,
cider and conversation flowed
freely. (Not necessarily in that
order !)

" Morphy Day " said the posters, in suitably embellished letters,
not revealing if this were to be a tribunal, a slide show (with or with-
out Closed Circuit TV) or whatever. It turned out to be an 8 mm.
movie with synchronised tape sound track, of the Morphy Day cele-
brations last term.
When passing comment on a
production such as this, one must
bear in mind the envisaged audi-
ence, the conditions under which
the film was made, and equip-
ment used. The film was oo-
viously made with IC students in
mind, people who know why
there is a clash of opinions on the
towpath, and who know what the
boats are doing on the river.
These students will have already
been to the event are thus
simply wishing to see themselves,
or have missed the whole thing
and now want to see why. If, as
is possible, the film is shown to
Freshmen, a more detailed ex-
planation will be necessary, in the
form, perhaps, of an improved
sound track.
The film started unheralded
after a few hitches with the syn-
chronising equipment, then ran
smoothly for the rest of the show.
It was one of those " See half
the plot before the titles " epics
with rather hilarious (?) opening
sequences designed to tickle one's
humorous. These pre-filled items
showing training on the river, and
the antics of the camera crew of
four. The " Maigret" style titles
were followed by the truth about
Morphy Day, containing some
excellent shots—the pre-briefing
of the combatants, the hospitality
of London Transport, the pa-
tience of Job (a bus driver at a
zebra crossing), the battle on the
towpath, and even some rowing.
The film finished with various en-
counters with the general public.
What of the technical quality ?
The editing, which appears to
have been done with " Quick-
splice," was well handled, con-
sidering that the material was
shot unscripted, under battle con-
ditions and often in a very poor
light. Some continuity was
achieved, but only for those who
knew the sequence of events any-
way, and who could tell an RCS
man by the colour of his under-
wear. The rowing sequences did
not make it clear which were the
races/re-rows/practice runs/other
eights/Oxford and or Cambridge.
The film tended to take the form
of a punch-up on the towpath
with cutaways to the river and
rowing, and vice-versa.
The one or two stage sequences
added interest, especially when
they concluded, as did the bal-
loon one with the artistic passing
comment to the camera, which
the most inexperienced lip reader
could understand. The College
Presidents also appeared (and
their vices) searching for that
elusive something in their hair.
The sound synchronisation
seemed to be excellent, so per-
haps a more ambitious sound
track with more spot effects could
have been tried. Some of the
rapid changes, in background
music were a little abrupt, though
the first fifteen minutes were good
soundwise, the picture content
matching the mood-music. The
last fifteen minutes, the backing
was adequate—even inspired at
one or two instances.
Considering that the film, with
sound, was on a budget of £10,
it was a right excellent produc-
tion. Comparing it with the last
8 mm. effort, " 1961 Carnival
Week," which ran mute, there
appears to be sufficient improve-
ment to justify the expense of
the 16 mm. sound on film, taken
over 18 months, of life at Im-
perial College, which is being
planned at the present moment.
"Morphy Day, 1963," was a
success. The audiences certainly
thought so.
On Saturday yet another friar,
Father Oswald conducted a Quiet
Day in St. Augustine's Church to
assist men and women who had
believed themselves called to do
something definite about them-
selves and their way of Christian
discipleship. This was attended
by about 50 people.
Quite the most important times
during the Campaign were the in-
numerable Coffee Parties—some
of them going on until the early
hours of the morning, with Friars
and all!—-where the very excel-
lent members of the Team of
Campaigners were able to meet a
large number of students, and
often to communicate to them in
a most unselfconscious and mov-
ingly genuine manner something
of the very deep and abiding
meaning of the great Truths con-
cerning God, Christ and His
Church.
Those of us who were privi-
leged to share in TWTWTW are
profoundly grateful a n
d most
particularly to the members of
the Team.
