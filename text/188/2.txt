Dear Sir,
We disapproved of the Presi-
dent's action at the last Union
meeting; we made this known to
him and he has admitted his mis-
take. We also disapprove of the
personal attacks on the President
in the columns of Felix. Apart
from his action at the Union
Meeting we have confidence in
him as President of l.C. Union.
Yours faithfully,
C. J. LIDDLE
(President C&GU)
B. L. OLDFIELD
(President RSMU)
M. HARRIS
(President RCSU)

Dear Sir,
The Excutive and Council have
pointed out to me that the two
reasons I had for justifying my
action at the last Union Meeting
—namely—(a) precedent and (b)
assent, are not valid. The prece-
dent was a bad one and in fact, I
did not have the consent of the
Union Meeting.
Having considered this, I now
believe that I made a mistake in
acting as I did at the last Union
Meeting; I therefore express my
apologies to the Union.
Yours faithfully,
ASIT CHANDMAL,
President, I.C. Union.
While few of ue wish to know the future, many hope-
reasonably—to have a hand in shaping It; and thle
requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But
traditional methods of probing the future are no longer
in favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.
Witches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today
one turns, In the first instance, to the appointments
officer for the pathways to the future. We, for
our part, would like to elaborate what lies along
one of them—Unilever Research.
Research In .Unilever means industrial research:
research directed to specific ends: research with a
practical outcome. But not only that. No Industrial
project or problem stands In Isolation. Its roots rarely
lie In Industry. So, research In Unilever also means
research in a number of contrasting fields—detergents,
edible fats, foods, cosmetics—and it means, further,
research In surface chemistry, glycerlde chemistry,
protein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental
topics. It means a community of scientific Interest within
Unilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.
It can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction
to the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.
It can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of it and
financial reward in the success of it. There is only one
minor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.

Dear Sir,
I was most surprised and dis-
turbed on reading two articles in
the last issue of Felix.
The news item by J. M.
Combes on the NUS debate had
many inaccurate and misleading
statements in it, giving the whole
article a strongly biased view to-
wards the side of those who are
not in favour of IC joining NUS.
While I don't much mind biased
views being- expressed in the edi-
torial, I do feel that you, as edi-
tor, should ensure that reports of
events should be truthful and free
from all bias.
As for Martin Stacey's article
" J'accuse," I wish I had his
ability to say " it is a fine thing to
be honest, but it is also important
to be right" (quoting Churchill)
one minute, and then write such
a deceitful and vicious personal
attack on the President of the
Union in the next. Even if Mr.
Chandmal's " outburst " was un-
precedented, which it was not,
there was no reason for you to
publish such an article which
could have done immense damage
to Mr. Chandmal's reputation
among those not present at the
last few minutes of the Union
Meeting to hear what really did
happen.
Yours sincerely,
DAVE WILCOX,
Physics III.
P.S.—/ would appreciate if you
would not publish any part of this
letter without publishing the
whole. I would also like a reply
on the points I have raised about
allowing these articles to go into
print, if possible to reach me by
Saturday, \6th (Union rack).
It is hard to answer charges
of inaccuracies unless these
are more specific. In any ctase
the Editor does not enter into
private correspondence about
articles published in FELIX
Dear Sir
I was one of the few who re-
corded their abstentions in the
vote at the recent NUS Debate.
I must confess, from my position
of neutrality, that I was mildly
surprised When the President
asked the Union's consent to his
speaking. I was again mildly sur-
prised when no one raised an ob-
jection. Faced with the vehemence
and decisiveness of his speech, I
was stunned.
Judging from the charges of
duplicity that have been hurled at
the President, it is evident that the
opposition to NUS thought that
he was on their side. True, they
did not object at the time. If
then the opposition were prepared
to let him speak, thinking that he
was on their side, their subse-
quent criticism of his action has
no justification.
The President defends his
action on the grounds that it had
ample precedent, and that no ob-
jections were raised at the time.
That there is precedence for an
action does not necessarily mean
that such an action is desirable.
If it has not been noted before let
it be noted now that such, action
is distasteful to IC Union. True,
there were no objections at the
time, for, when surprised, the
humaa.being needs time to think
Reasonable beings seem to be
agreed that on the fact that NUS
is a cause worthy of support.
What is in question is whether IC
can afford to join without losing
some of its excellent and valuable
facilities. I personally got the
impression that the Rector, or the
authorities, would be willing to
provide us with the money, or
much of it, should we decide to
join NUS. But how is one to
know ? Council, who might
have the answer, are divided.
That the division is not into two
equal groups is no help to me, as
I place more weight, per person,
on the judgment of the individuals
in the minority group.
Yours neutrally,
JEYAN ANKETELL,
Department of Physics.
Dear Sir,
Mr. Stacey, in your last issue,
described the voting system in the
recent NUS meeting as " a voting
system so devised as to permit
half the people to decide after
hearing only half the debate ! "
He might have added that some
people voted without hearing any
of the debate; even the hall of
the RGS was too small to allow
all those who wanted admittance
to actually get in. These were,
however, allowed to vote, and
quite rightly. This was despite
the fact that less than one-third
of the Union members voted any-
way. Under these circumstances,
can any decision ever be de-
scribed is democratic, and repre-
senting the majority opinion of
the Union ?
It is not good enough to blame
this 28 per cent, poll on the
apathy among Union members.
Union debates, unfortunately, are
often an utter waste of time and
most Ijnion members just do not
have the time to waste. I left the
NUS debate at 2.45 after hearing
two good speeches and a lot of
rubbish—and neither of the good
speeches made any new points to
me. When this issue is next
raised, I shall go along, register
my vote, and leave.
This prompts me to ask why a
referendum cannot be held to
settle this matter once and for all.
Voting slips could easily be distri-
buted by the departmental reps.
