IC prosed that they are the best squad in
L J L U by virtue of a brilliant performance at
the U L U Championships on November 19.
The men's team won the men's trophy and
the women's team had representation in most
finals.
R i c h a r d Leach almost 'stole' the 33m
dash, then took first place in the 100m
backstroke. N i c k Last and Steve T a y l o r
finished second a n d t h i r d i n . the 4 0 0 m
freestyle. W h e n R i c h finally ran out of energy
(i.e. couldn't finish the 100m butterfly), Paul
Rodgers fought his way into third place.
G r a h a m Singleton also picked up points with
a third in the 100m backstroke. Jim Boucher,
the learn coach, finished fifth in the I . M . and
third in the breaststroke.
T h e girls, some of whom were competing
for the first time, produced some excellent
swims. Wendy Moore and Caroline Tombs
led the way with Caroline taking third place
in the 200m freestyle and I M while Wendy
finished fourth in the 33m dash and the I M .
Other notables were Jane C a m p b e l l in the
backstroke final and M a r i a T u c k who was
fourth in the 100m breastroke.
The men's A team won the medley relay,
with our B team a close second. In the
freestyle relay the A team were second to
Bedford College as R i c h let his kid brother
beat him on the final leg.

IC Water Polo team followed up the success
of the swimming team by winning the U L U
knock-out last Thursday at U L U . W e were
handicapped by a number of goals to give
weaker sides (i.e. the rest!) a chance.
Early on we disposed of L o n d o n Hospital
4-1. with goals from Chris and. R i c h a r d ; and
K i n g s / L S E combination 3-1. Nick scoring
three goals.
T h e final took place over four quarters and
due to handicapping we started the match
8-2 down to Bedford College.
IC started well, reducing the deficit to
three goals after the first quarter, and we only
trailed by two goals at the end of the second.
Although Bedford's G B international took
over in the third and we went 5 down at one
stage, our fitness and teamwork enabled us to
light back to be 13-10 down with 1 quarter to
play. Due to brilliant shooting we forced exl i a
time with the score 14-14 at the end of
normal time.
T h e first period ol extra time was scoreless
but I C took the lead for the first time in the
match early in the second period. Although
Bedford equalised, Chris clinched the winner
for us shortly afterwards.

Bowling
O n Friday, November 27. twelve bowlers
made their way to Birmingham to compete in
the B i r m i n g h a m M a r a t h o n . Bowling non-stop
from midnight Friday to midday Saturday,
all in aid of the N S P C C .
Alter a brief (?) warming-up period in the
bar, the two teams took their lanes.
IC. I, had a slow start, but warmed-up
quickly and reached a peak at about 5:00am
when Steve Bryer bowled the team's high
game ol 223, for which he won a bottle of
wine. F r o m then on the game levelled oil'
with the team finishing 7th overall with
14.548 pins.
IC II had a good start and a good finish
and. apart from K e v i n Short who bowled
well all morning and got the team's high
score of 177. not very much happened. T h e
(earn came 14th overall (out of 15) (thanks to
Brunei C. w'ho came last) and scored 12,128
pins.

Q Sailing
T h e IC team were not up at the H a r p being
beaten last w e e k e n d — instead they were
being beaten at Cambridge.
H a v i n g travelled down in anticipation of
sailing "zooms" (the new boat Cambridge
have on approval) on a decent lake. W e
found ourselves sailing decomposing, leaky
" L a r k s " on a duck pond down a muddy lane
in die middle of a wood. T h e trees around the
lake made the wind unbelievably shifty and
light in certain areas.
A l l credit to Cambridge who managed to
spot the headers that you could almost tack
on without moving the tiller.

Seconds
The seconds maintained their fine run this
weekend, with a convincing win over local
rivals U x b r i d g e . F o l l o w i n g the shock of
having eleven players, an umpire and seeing
A n d y Garms is a suit and tie; the team made
its o w n w a y to H a r l i n g t o n ; M r G r a y
strategically placed next to T i m Mitchell's
girlfriend (Hope you're not reading this,
Dana!).

immediately—probably due to him having
his thighs massaged as a pre-match warm-up!
T e a m spirit consequently rose and by the
interval we were two goals up through an
excellent goal by A n d y Garms and a Wylie
Special.
In all a line all-round performance by the

Ladies
Today, we decided to have another bash at
beating Wye and even managed to put out a
team of eleven players for the occasion.
However it was a disastrous game and we
were soundly beaten (5-2) — it's a pity we
didn't play as well as we did against them last
week. Still, it wasn't a total waste of time
because Wye are a friendly bunch and gave
us a lovely tea and we had a super ride
through the K e n t countryside. W e arrived so
early that we had time lor a fifteen mile
detour to sec all those golden cornfields and
rolling hillsides. F u l l marks to the driver for
some inventive manoeuvring along some very
tricky country lanes (I hope his cough gets
better). M a n y thanks to Johnson for the
constructive criticism (and for umpiring).
