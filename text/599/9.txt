Bader—Author Laddie Lucus will both be in
the Bookshop to sign copies of the only
authorised biography of Sir Douglas Bader,
Flying Colours, Hutchinson, £8.95.
The book contains a new and contro-
versial assessment of the Battle of Britain.
The author e x p o s e s for the first time
Douglas Bader's tactical concept of the
battle and his critics are decisively answered
with facts and fresh official evidence.
If by unfortunate chance you will not be
able to come and meet Sir Douglas Bader
but you would like the book signed, let me
know and we will get them to sign for you.
Socialist
Which British political party has twelve M P s ,
several hundred councillors and an individual
membership of 15,000?
The answer is the Co-operative Party. The
co-operative movement is perhaps best known
for its familiar high street shops run by local
co-operative retail societies and schemes like
the Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative. Few
people are aware of its political wing. O n
T u e s d a y , D e c e m b e r 8, P e t e r C l a r k e , a
r e s e a r c h officer at C o - o p e r a t i v e P a r t y
headquarters will be speaking about its aims
and, in particular, its novel scheme for tackling
youth unemployment through self-supporting
groups.
The meeting is at 1:00pm in Maths 341 and
all are welcome.
Ents
O K , it's Friday already and you still haven't
bought your 'Almost Xmas Party' ticket. Y o u
can still get them (only £1) from the Ents Room
or Hall Reps—see Hall noticeboards. The
band at tonight's party is a pop/reggae band
called 'Bumble and the Beez'—have you ever
heard a reggae band use electronic drums
before?! They recently supported both Hazel
O'Connor and John Martyn on their British
tours and their single is already in the charts.
Forthcoming events include a 'Heavy Rock'
night (next Friday) with 'Overkill' and 'Blue
Man' in the Lower Refectory—we would like to
thank Mark Smith for moving the venue of the
F E L I X Dinner to allow this event to take place!
A n ' X m a s . . . . a t last' party is also being
organised for Wednesday, December 16, in
the Concert Hall. There will be a disco, bar,
rock band—A Blue Zoo (more about them
later) and....and wait for it....cartoons!—all for
just £1. For just 50p, this Thursday's film is
Taxi Driver.
As you will see elsewhere in F E L I X today,
n e x t T h u r s d a y we a r e h a v i n g o f f i c i a l
elections at 1:00pm in the Upper Lounge. If
you're at al! interested, please come along as
there will also be a general discussion about
entertainments at IC.
SF Soc
What does the devil do in his spare time? How
unsmoothly is it possible for the course of true
love to run? If you want a right good belly laugh
and a solution to the problem of evil, then go to
Bedazzled, the next S F Soc film on Tuesday in
Mech Eng 220 at 6:30pm. If comedy and
theology aren't your bag, then don't forget that
Raquel Welch is in it (as well as Peter Cook,
Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries and Eleanor
Bron). Definitely a film redolent with not-to-be-
missedness.
While on the subject of films, it has been
brought to my attention that Ents think I don't
like them. Nothing could be further from the
truth. All my past statements about them were
g e n u i n e e x p r e s s i o n s of s y m p a t h y a n d
gratitude for blokes with a hard job who so
often are blamed when things go wrong and
are not mentioned at all when things go right. I
was not being sarcastic at a l l , and was
dismayed to learn that I was being taken the
wrong way, which comes as a bit of a blow to a
person as articulate as I am. Still, life's like that.
No jokes this week, and for several weeks no
by-line either. Depressing isn't it?

Wing Chun
In Chinese history Buddhism and Shaolin
temple are synonymous with Kung F u . Wing
Chun Kung F u has its roots here. A Buddhist
nun, who after observing a fight between a
white crane and snake devised a system of self-
defence from the action of these animals. She
took into account the difference in physique
between men and women when she created
the art, whose close range techniques have
simple yet fast and lethal moves.
Master Yip Man introduced the art to Hong
Kong after the Second World War. Througb
his students (such as Bruce Lee and Master
Lau) Wing C h u n gradually spread across to
the western world. Master Lau is one of the
leading exponents in Wing Chun.
The IC Wing C h u n Club is a division of
M a s t e r L a u ' s W i n g C h u n A c a d e m y . T o
celebrate the birth of our club recently we
have arranged a social evening on December
12, at 7:00pm, in the Union Building.
The programme includes a demonstration of
Wing Chun Kung Fu by Master Lau, food,
drinks, raffle, music and party games.
If you are interested, hurry and get your
ticket from Sandeep Jesndasen Civ Eng 3,
Edgar Pilkington E E 1 , Benny Notarianni Phys
3, Union Office.
Wing C h u n classes are held on Wednesdays
in the Union G y m between 3:00 and 6:00pm;
and Saturdays in the Union G y m between
11:00 and 2:00pm
The meeting of Thursday, November 26, was
addressed by Mike Terry, an active member of
A n t i - A p a r t h e i d . M i k e presented a highly
i n f o r m a t i v e a c c o u n t o n the h i s t o r y a n d
prospects of nuclear proliferation in South
Africa.
Unquestionable evidence was presented for
the existence of a South African bomb, along
with disturbing developments in battlefield
nuclear shells and weapon delivery systems.
Mike laid the blame directly with the U S and
British policies to provide large amounts of
technological assistance for so-called "peaceful
development of nuclear reactor facilities".
Work is now beginning on the production of
leaflets and eventually a larger and more
c o m p r e h e n s i v e newspaper. H o w e v e r it is
essential that people offer to help in the writing
of these. If you would like to contribute in teh
form of articles, cartoons, format, or whatever,
please send your ideas to C . J . Harries, Mech
Eng P G , so that we may consider them and tell
you if we think it's worth doing.
A n I C C N D Bookshop is now set up in the
J C R every M o n d a y l u n c h t i m e . Please go
along, and, more importantly encourage those
who remain undecided to pay it a visit.
The final meeting of term, on Thursday,
December 10, will be addressed by Owen
Greene, who many of you will know, has been
working with the "London After The Bomb"
S A N A group. He will be talking about some
of the group's preliminary findings.
