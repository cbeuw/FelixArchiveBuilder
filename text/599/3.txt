Jam packed for Hartley
New chair in Biotechnology
T h e final Centenary lecture was given by Professor B.S. Hartley I R S
of the Biochemistry department at Imperial College. H i s lecture was
entitled ' R C S Leads into Biotechnology'. H e firstly explained the
techniques involved in producing commercially important materials
by bacteriological fermentation.
O n e has initially to isolate the gene coding for the material one
wishes to manufacture. This can be done by a variety of classical
mapping techniques. T h e n it is necessary to excise the gene from the
genome, this is done by specific enzymes t e r m e d r e s t r i c t i o n
endonucleases. It is possible to then isolate the gene by hybridization to
a radioactive messenger R N A . Once isolated the fragment has to be
inserted in a cloning vector. The cloning vector is usually a plasmid (a
circle of D N A found in bacteria) that is treated with the same
restriction endonuclease that was used on the donor genome. T h e ends
of the gene will then adhere to the ends of the plasmid and a hybrid
D N A structure will be formed. The plasmid usually has a antibiotic
resistant gene so that when the plasmid is inserted in the bacteria the
culture can be cleared of those without plasmids. The bacteria will
then multiply and generate the desired metabolite.
Professor Hartley then went on to describe the way a vaccine was
developed for hepatitis B virus using this technology in 18 months. H e
then discussed the much more complex problem of cloning human
interferon (one of several that were later discovered) which mainly
centred on developing high producing strains. Professor Hartley
revealed that the biochemistry department had played the key role of
solving the problem of large scale fermentation of interferon producing
bacteria. H e then outlined key areas where the application of this
technology would have a revolutionary effect. They ranged from
preventive medicine, genetic advice and plant pathology in the short
term to the long term of genetic surgery.
H e also discussed his present investigation of the possibility of using
bacteria to digest hermicelluloses to produce ethanol. Professor Levy
and D r Palmer in the biology department, he said, were looking at the
degredation o f l i g n i n (a principle polymer in wood) in order to provide
commercially important phenolic compounds. H e also listed a number
of biochemicals such as the antibiotic pseudomonii acid that had been
developed at Imperial College.
Professor H a r t l e y then looked i n t o the f u t u r e . H e a r g u e d
p e r s u a s i v e l y that t h e r e were m a n y o p p o r t u n i t i e s o p e n for
biotechnology. H e revealed that at a A U T meeting a motion had been
passed stating that biotechnology at IC should not expand if that
meant redundancies in other areas. H e said he could understand this
Ludditism, but was saddened by it. However, he said that he would do
his very best to attract money from private industry to support his
research team. H e then unveiled his p l a n to establish work in
biotechnology rt Imperial College. H e wanted to see close colaboration
between the chemistry, biology and chemical engineering departments
to establish a linn base. H e also revealed that the Leverhulme
foundation would be funding a chair in biotechnology at Imperial
College. In conclusion he said that though R C S was not leading at the
moment, he would do his very best to ensure that it would in the
future.
There then followed a series of questions. They were initiated by
M r Gerard Fairbrough, Cheif Executive of Celltech, Britain's first
commercial biotechnology company, who had introduced the lecture.
At then end of the lecture Professor Hartley was thanked by his
friend and collaborator Professor Blow, Dean of the R o y a l College of
Science.

theory of elementary particles.
Imperial College's Professor
A b d u s S a l a m ( w h o w o n his
Nobel Prize jointly with W e i n -
berg) was in the chair.
T h e t a l k was of a h i g h l y
theoretical nature; two of the
main problems being accelerat-

around 101 9

Currently the former is impos-
sible, while attempts are being
m a d e to s t u d y the l a t t e r i n
several locations in A m e r i c a , by
observing thousands of tonnes of
water.
The most disappointing aspect
of the event was that the venue
was too small, and it had been
poorly advertised. W i t h a little
more effort, even the Great H a l l

Heinz spills
the beans!
O n M o n d a y Wellsoc presented a
talk by Heinz Wolll'e, best known
to the public for his appearances
in the BBC's ' Y o u n g Scientist'
and 'Great Egg Race' series. The
lecture was entitled "Fools for
L i v i n g ' , and concerned the work
d o n e by M r W o l f f e a n d his
colleagues at the Clinical R e -
search Centre at H a r r o w , and
others, in producing devices to
e n a b l e the e l d e r l y a n d the
disabled to live fuller and more
i n d e p e n d e n t lives. M r W o l f f e
considers that the i n c r e a s i n g
spending power of the elderly,
coupled with their higherexpecta-
tions of living standards, will
h a v e as l a r g e a n i m p a c t on
commerce as that ol teenagers in
the 1950s and 60s. This develop-
ment will involve job creation

the young disabled.
Next week, Wellsoc present a

The lirst meeting this year of the
Environmental Society took the
form of a talk on M o n d a y by
Paul Lkins. General Secretary of
the Ecology Party, in which the
party's philosophy and policies
were outlined.
M r F.lkins stressed that his
party did not believe, as did the
lour main British parties, that
improvement in the quality of life
could be achieved by continu-
ously increasing production and
consumption. His party's policies
were based on production with
the m i n i m u m e c o l o g i c a l dis -
r u p t i o n a n d the m a x i m u m
c o n s e r v a t i o n , as w e l l as the

a d v o c a t e d d e c e n t r a l i z a t i o n ,
increased self-sufficiency and a
m o r e g e n u i n e l y d e m o c r a t i c ,
small-scale society; in particular
they proposed greater incentives
lor the employment of people
'the most underused resource'.
Next week, the Environmental
