Natural History
The society organise regular lectures, trips and
films. So far this term we have had Professor
Smyth and Doctor Lamb give lectures on
parasites from pets and wine-making. We
organised an afternoon trip to Silwood Park
field station to introduce first year life scientists
to the station and the work that is done there
and two groups from the society went around
the British Museum (Natural History) during
its open days. So far this term we have been on
four bird-watching rips. At Rickmansworth, we
had good views of siskins and redpolls and at
Barn Elms Reservoir we saw goldeneye and a
kestrel at very close range. We have also been
further afield; at Rainham in Essex we saw
bramblings and a hen harrier despite being
under fire from the local army ranges! At
Sheppey on the North Kent coast we saw
another hen harrier and a short-eared owl,
purple sandpiper and flocks of wintering snow
buntings.
Coming up we have a lecture by M r A .
Seccombe on 'The Wildlife of the Seychelles'
and an R S P B film accompanied by cider and
cheese. Next term we have already organised
lectures on Butterflies by Prof E. Laithwaite,
Polution by Doctor D . Dolby, and Schisto-
somes by D r C . Wright.

Economy Drive
"Student driver"—this produces images of a
beat-up Mini, doing wheel spin starts at traffic
lights. Well City and Guilds Motor Club does
like to try other things as well. For example on
the 29th of this month it is organising an
Econorun.
Translated out of jargon this means that
competitors will be trying to squeeze every last
mile out of each gallon. Following a challenging
route from easy navigation. S o tbe event is not
only a competition in its own right, but also an
excellent introduction to rallying.
I can hear some of you saying "But my
Land Rover only ever does 17 miles to the
gallon." Well, to make things fair, your result is
compared to accepted consumption figures for
the model.
So, if you fancy stripping off the roof-rack,
winding up the windows and trying not to lose
any speed on the corners, why not enter.
If you have images of throwing around a fully
p r e p a r e d R S 1 8 0 0 , but have never d r i v e n
competitively, why not come along.
Details from the Motor Club noticeboard in
Mechanical Engineering.
Y o u might even enjoy driving economically!

Seconds
O n Wednesday the Second X V travelled into
the sticks to play the R o y a l Vets College.
W h e n the referee eventually turned up the
game started with I C dominating.
Aggressive play by the forwards set up the
ball for the backs who, despite changes of
position, ran the ball well, ending in the left
winger R. Frith scoring two tries, and the
right winger R. F l y n n scoring one. T w o of
them were converted by M . Winsor.
T h e vets c a p i t a l i z e d on a l u l l i n the
enthusiasm in the second quarter and ran in
two converted tries. These were probably due
to players being confused by technical line-
out calls like 'bovine mastitis'!
A f t e r the i n t e r v a l I C r e g a i n e d t h e i r
confidence and played most of the remaining
game in the opposition half and with good
forward support the ball was moved along
the backs, leading to R . Frith scoring his
third try.
F r o m a well tuned penalty move W . Aston
crashed over the line to score and with M .
Winsor converting this and a later penalty,
Imperial were the eventual winners by 29-12.
T e a m : M. Winsor, R. Frith, G. Pike, W.
Chapman, R. Flynn, M. Thompson, J. Paixdo, S.
Bell, C. Cole, J. Hutton, C. Henderson, T. Carr,
D. McGee, W. Aston, M. Pearce.

t o u r n a m e n t w h i c h w a s a n i n v i t a t i o n
tournament between teams from universities
i n E u r o p e . T h e c o m p e t i t i o n started at
10:30am and we were drawn in a pool with
Dijon, Bochen and Eindhoven 2 (the home B
team). W e were at a slight disadvantage as
we only had a six man team so in any contest
we lost the first bout by default, also our team
consisted of two brown, two green and two
orange belts whereas all of the other teams
were mainly black belts.
W e were drawn to light Bochen lirst and
made a valiant effort, winning two lights; the
losing members of the team put up incredibly
good opposition and their loss can be blamed
on lack ol competition experience.
Next we (ought Dijon and in the tradition
of French clubs they were very good, we-only
managed one draw, this time some of the
blame can be laid on bad refcreeing as we got
two bad decisions.
In the last light in out pool against one ol
the home learns wc managed one thaw and
sullen-d greatly from la< k ol experience.
There ended the competition lor us so
missing the final 'wc were showering; which
Strasbourg won. then retired to the Street of a.
Thousand Bats lot a quiel drink. Il was
g e n e r a l l y d e c i d e d that the n a m fought
incredibly well, perhaps next year wc may do
better.
