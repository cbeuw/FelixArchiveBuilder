Desert Rats
Nearly a year ago a group of
keen and ambitious physicists
decided to launch an expedi-
tion to what is probably the
most widely know desert
region, the Sahara.
The idea didn't materialise over
night; it arose, rather, as a natural
progression of events starting
from a discussion about holiday
plans during the long vac. "Having
decided where to go, we then had
to decide 'why'?, 'in what?' and
'how do we finance it?'" explained
Simon Rodan.
From this seemingly shambolic
s t a r t i n g p o i n t d e v e l o p e d an
expedition covering 4,000 miles,
two thousand in the Sahara itself,
in two L W B landrovers, over an
eight week period during August
and September.
Ideas for scientific studies were
collected and chewed over by the
team of six, and three projects
were chosen. These were outlined
in a document, which also con-
tained the proposed route, dates,
modes of transport and predicted
expenses, which was submitted to
the Exploration Board of Imperial
College, which has a small annual
budget frokm which it can help
fund s u c h v e n t u r e s . M a l c o l m
Risbey, the expedition's treasurer
recalls those initial attempts at
c o s t i n g : " w h e n we set about
calculating the cost of the trip we
w e r e v e r y u n s u r e as to the
accuracy of our predictions, but
surprisingly perhaps, if you take
into account the fact that we now
have two landrovers rather than
one as originally planned, we have
kept remarkably closely to our
original estimates." The team was
interviewed by the board, and
s u b s e q u e n t l y g a i n e d o f f i c i a l
r e c o g n i t i o n a n d a s u b s t a n t i a l
degree of financial assistance.
Of the immediate tasks, by far
the most pressing was to get
s p o n s o r s h i p , p r i m a r i l y f r o m
British Industry. During February
and March, the six members of
the team wrote, and produced a
b r o c h u r e briefly outlining the
expedition. These they sent with
a c c o m p a n y i n g letters to more
t h a n t w o h u n d r e d a n d fifty
companies in the U K requesting
aid either in cash or in kind. The
A l g e r i a n E m b a s s y had to be
contacted, and were most helpful'
even if tied by too much red tape.
Another document was produced
for the A l g e r i a n M i n i s t r y of
Education, in French and English,
four copies each of this largish fifty
page type script. "In the end this
was all wasted time since we did
not get any response from the
Algerians until early November."
By June, quite a large amount of
help had arrived despite, the poor
state of the e c o n o m y , w h i c h
meant a 4% success rate in terms
of useful replies to letters sent
compared to a predicted rate of
10% or more, and none of this in
the form of direct (and m u c h
needed) financial aid.
O n the scientific side, David
Harris and Clive Standley spent
many weeks carefully construct-
ing the delicate net flux radio-
meters needed for the project and
devising the scientific procedure
for the experiments. The aim of
the p r i m a r y p r o j e c t was to
i n v e s t i g a t e the r e l a t i o n s h i p
between heat transfer to and from
the desert floor and high altitude
water vapour. As July 28, the
scheduled departure date, drew
nearer the final stages of prepara-
tion were completed, the most
detailed available maps studied,
routes finalised and an accurate
itinerary drawn up. Dehydrated
food was bought and items of
equipment such as sand ladders,
m i l i t a r y s p e c g e r r i c a n s a n d
frames.
All the team attended courses
on desert survival and first aid,
while individual members went on .
specialised courses in landrover
maintenance, expedition photo-
graphy, and maintenance of the
two chart recorders (which were
the most important individual
items in the experiment) at the
manufacturers, Chessell Ltd of
Worthing, who had kindly donated
the recorders.
Everything was going to plan
until two weeks before the team
was due to leave, three of them
learned that they had failed an
exam and they were advised by
the department to sit the retakes
o n S e p t e m b e r 2. T h e t e a m
returned to London, where they
met Brian Morgan, Director of
U G Studies, and Keith Barnham,
Senior Tutor, and subsequently
Bob Schroder and Don Adlington,
C h a i r m a n a n d S e c r e t a r y res-
p e c t i v e l y of the E x p l o r a t i o n
Board. It was decided that the
best s o l u t i o n , if s p o n s o r s h i p
c o m m i t m e n t s were not to be
ignored, and as the team were still
keen to go, was to postpone the
trip until the f o l l o w i n g y e a r .
U n f o r t u n a t e l y s i n c e then two
m e m b e r s h a v e h a d s e c o n d
thoughts and have dropped out,
leaving the team with four. "We
would still like to take eight people
this summer, since we have got
the room and we could do with
some fresh ideas," said Andrew
L a y t o n , the t e a m ' s r e s i d e n t
mechanic.
So now the team must start
once again to get the show rolling,
though this year much of the work
has already been done. If anyone
reading this article feels that they
would like to take on the challenge
that the expedition offers, there
are four places to be filled before
C h r i s t m a s . A n y o n e interested
should get in touch with Simon
R o d a n , M a l c o l m Risby, D a v i d
Harris or Andrew Layton all of
Physics 2.
