Human Rights Week
The IC Union Human Rights Week com-
mences on Monday, and coincides with a
slightly more auspicious week of events
organised by the United Nations. The aim at
IC is to provide students with information
about violations of human rights in many parts
of the world. More importantly, the dynamic
clubs and societies running the events will be
illustrating what students here can do to
counter such grave abuses.
Naturally, euents will be held at lunchtimes
and during the evening. Each participating
society will be organising their own events,
ranging from a filmshow to a picket of the
Rector's pad. Unfortunately, Ihe idea of
having a Human Rights Week was suggested
only recently, meaning that the itinery of
events is not yet definite. However, at the time
of writing, here are the details, society by
society.
Socialist Society
Soc S o c is concerned about the exploitation of
Third World workers; a particular example of
this is coffee pickers, people often receiving
less than Â£45 p e r year. It's obvious that
middlemen make vast profits; mentioning no
names, but Nestles has a higher turnover than
the earnings of the vast majority of African
nations.
There is an alternative! Campaign Coffee, a
non-profit-making body supplies coffee from
Tanzania. When you buy it, a large part- of
your money goes to the workers who picked
the beans for you and so rightly deserve it.
Soc S o c , believing in a fairer deal for the
Third World, is selling Campaign Coffee every
lunchtime in the J C R during H.R. Week. Free
samples might even be given, just to prove the
inferiority of M r Mooney's produce. So, come
along and start stirring for a better world.
Additionally, the society is having a speaker
from the Society for the Protection of the
U n b o r n C h i l d , T u e s d a y at 6:30pm in the
Green Committee Room. Naturally, the issue
of whether a woman's right to abortion or the
fundamental right of human life should have
the priority will be discussed.
West London Chaplaincy
S. A m e r i c a is o n e of t h e w o r l d ' s most
inhumane continents. Poverty, hunger and
military dictatorships make the lives of the
people there almost as bad as those of IC
students. T h e West London Chaplaincy is
hosting a n authoritative speaker, recently
returned from Peru, on this issue. The talk is
on Thursday lunchtime.
Conservative Society
Conservative Society will be holding a display
in the J C R on Thursday o n human rights
violations in the U S S R .
Labour Club
Labour Club will be holding a display in the
J C R on Thursday on human rights violations
in Chile.
Positive Alternatives to Abortion
Society
P A T A ' s display in the J C R on Thursday will be
dealing with the human rights aspect of the
abortion debate. Particular emphasis will be
placed on the unborn child's rights as dfefined
in the United Nations Declaration o n the
Rights of the Child, the European Convention
of Human Rights and the decision of the West
German supreme court which decided that
unborn children in Germany were protected
by the constitution.
Jewish Soc
W h e n leaning o n bars c a n be a little
different
Imagine the National Front has gained power
in Britain. N o w assume that you, upset by
this development, wanted to leave the country
but they won't allow it. Legally you can go but
in practise... tough. 400,000 people have
applied, but only 400 people, this year, were
granted the permits now required to leave the
country.
Does all this sound rather unlikely? Well, if
you replace Britain with R u s s i a a n d the
National Front by the Communist Party, we
are describing a situation that exists today. If
you wish to know more about how you can be
thrown out of university when all you want to
do is leave Russia and if you want to know
what you can do to help, visit our stall in the
J C R next Thursday. It won't take you long,
busy as you are in the hectic eleven week
terms of Imperial. In Russia the terms are
somewhat longer.
U N S o c
There will definitely be a stall on Thursday in
the J C R describing the work of this new
society. A t least one speaker meeting during
the week is being held.
Islamic Society
We will be holding a bookstall and have a
speaker on Wednesday, December 9, in the
afternoon.
Amnesty International G r o u p
The A l Group will be adding a different aspect
to Human Rights Week. We're holding an
hour-long filmshow, screening The Hand and
Paradise Lost. 'The Hand', a short, animated
film, depicts the oppression of the individual
behind the Iron Curtain, whilst 'Paradise Lost'
focuses on Paraguay, a country ruled by
a military dictator for the past seventeen years.
Venue and time to be announced.
We also intend to have a speaker from our
British section, explaining A m n e s t y Inter-
national's work. John Cleese, Peter Cook and
Kate Bush won't be here, but someone more
knowledgable will. Definitely an evening event.
At the A l stall in the J C R , you will be able to
play in the 'Dictator's World C u p ' (adapted
from the book Junta United). In addition,
Christmas cards will be on sale, and we'll be on
hand to explain the work we're doing on behalf
of Firmin Awadon. Firmin was a student, just
like you; unfortunately, the military dictator in
Benin Oust west of Nigeria) won't tolerate
discussion of his policies, and has had Firmin
imprisoned for two years now without trial.
Needless to say, the prison conditions are
disgusting. Come to our stall, and find out
how you can help set the world to rights.
Anti-Apartheid Group
The Anti-Apartheid Group is definitely holding
a picket outside the Rector's pad next Friday
at 11:00am. This is to protest against College
p o l i c y o n S o u t h A f r i c a n g o v e r n m e n t -
sponsored students on the nuclear technology
course here. The group believes that such
students will, on their return to South Africa,
actively assist in the production of nuclear
weapons.
O n a cultural level, the group is offering
students here an opportunity to appreciate
native South African art. There will be an
exhibition of paintings by children on level two
of the Sherfield Building.
Baha'i Society
Since the beginning of the Iranian revolution,
the Baha'is of the world have greviously borne
the news of the persecution of their fellow
believers in that country. The largest religious
minority in Iran, the Baha'i faith has been
excluded from the new constitution.
O n a large scale, holy places have been
destroyed, many Baha'is executed, and private
property looted and burned. Life savings have
b e e n c o n f i s c a t e d , a n d the e n t i r e B a h a ' i
community is subjected to many forms of
discrimination, humiliation, and violence.
The Baha'i faith is a world religion with its
o w n s c r i p t u r e s , l a w s a n d c a l e n d a r . It
r e p r e s e n t s a c r o s s - s e c t i o n of h u m a n i t y ,
including almost every nationality and trade.
The central teachings are the oneness of G o d ,
religion and mankind. The terrible persecution
now being witnessed in Iran stems from an
i n t o l e r a n t a t t i t u d e o n t h e p a r t of t h e
authorities there. The Baha'i Society will be
holding a speaker meeting on the subject of
Baha'is in Iran next Thursday at 1:00pm, in
Lecture Theatre 213, Huxley Building.
Catholic Society
Catholic Society is using the theme of equality
for Human Rights Week, believing that nobody
should be discriminated against as a result of
their race, creed or culture. T o this end, the
society is holding a stall next Thursday in the
J C R .
Catholic Society is helping to give people in
Tanzania the right to food. Unfortunately, our
s p o n s o r e d walk to raise funds for a fish
farming project is not being held next week,
but in early March. However, the stall should
have more information about this.
