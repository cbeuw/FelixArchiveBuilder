QEC Merger
A fourth CCU?
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the joint working party
set up to examine closer collaboration between Imperial
College and Queen Elizabeth College recommended that the
colleges should form an "association with the intent of a
merger at a later date".
The working party was set up about one month ago and has met
regularly during November. T h e proposals are presented in the form of
a draft for discussion within the colleges. N o decision will be taken until
full consultations have taken place.
The main theme of the proposal is that Q E C should be incorporated
into I C as a fourth constituent college. The bioscience part of Q E C is
proposed to be physically moved to the I C site, which would require a
new building (probably on the site next to new Chemistry). The
physical sciences at Q E C would be "accommodated elsewhere within
the university".
Joint planning and consultative committees are to be set up to
achieve a closer working relationship prior to the eventual merger. The
timescale of the proposal is approximately five years, but major
developments might be expected before that time.
The proposal is in response to the problems of finance and student
numbers facing L o n d o n University. It is not clear however just what
financial savings will be made, and no mention is made of this in the
statement. Student numbers would presumably fall, although the new
'super I C would be larger than it is now.
A petition calling lor an Emergency U G M to discuss the matter was
received in the U n i o n Office yesterday. The External Affairs Committee
is meeting at 5:45pm on Tuesday, December 8 in the Union Office to draft,,

reacts to
Scarman
Report
Daily Mail, Monday.
Imperial College has taken up the call by Lord Scarman for
positive discrimination in favour of Britain's under privileged
ethnic minorities.
In an article in M o n d a y ' s Daily Mail L o r d Flowers said that he
expected about six special students a year to be taken on for degree
courses, starting next October. These will be people who are unable,
through no fault of their own or lack of ability, to qualify for a place at
Imperial. " T h e y might have some mediocre A Level passes or they
might not have any A Levels at all. W e have carefully not talked about
colour, but clearly it is a scheme to benefit black students from places
like Notting H i l l and Brixton. W e are going some way towards
correcting the lack of privilege some students have had in the past," he
said.
Although the College has been thinking for some time of ways to
help people who normally would be unlikely to get in, the Scarman
Report has obviously precipitated developments to get the College to
"do their b i t " .
L o r d Flowers said that he hoped the move would encourage other
universities to carry out similar schemes for deprived children.
College Secretary J o h n Smith said " B u t we're not looking for token
blacks or anything like that. We don't need them. W e want to try and
take up what L o r d Scarman said and try to do something positive
about i t . "
