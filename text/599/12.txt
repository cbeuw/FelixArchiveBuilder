Q E C - I C Merger
Even though the statement issued this week
was only a draft proposal to be put to both the
governing bodies, it is quite obvious that as
both principals have accepted the draft it will
undoubtedly be the basis for any merger. Thus
the students of this College must make their
views known.
The draft proposal would seem to suggest
that the biosciences from Imperial College
would be combined with the food and nutrition,
courses at Q E C to form a fourth Constituent
College. I for one think that we should not kiss
the Life S c i e n c e s division goodbye as a
sacrificial lamb to save Q E C . T h e R o y a l
College of Science of necessity must include
the Life Sciences and already has a strong
r e p u t a t i o n a n d t r a d i t i o n i n t h i s f i e l d .
Establishing a fourth constituent college which
would not have any real status (initially) by
chopping off a lump of R C S seems ludicrous,
especially as R C S already has the status.
A n emergency U G M has been called for
which will take place next Thursday. This is
the only way in which the Union can form
policy with the direct involvement of the
students involved. It is up to you, the students,
to turn up and make your feelings clear.
I sympathise with the plight of Q E C , who
have been hit very hard by the cuts and must
struggle to s u r v i v e . B u t in k e e p i n g their
identity, we must not lose ours.
Come along to the Emergency U G M
being called for next week and let your
views be known.
Bound Editions
Those people who took the wise decision to
invest in a bound copy of last year's F E L I X will
be delighted to know that they have arrived.
These can be collected from the office and
reminders will be sent to those who ordered
them.
The Knocking Shop
Still no response from the College about the
awfully e m b a r r a s s i n g refectory flat in the
Union Quad. However, I note a bill before
Parliament to legalise brothels, so I suppose
M r M o o n e y c o u l d take advantage of the
situation and open a profitable outlet in the
Union Building! We could whell in Lampost Lil
and B a c k l a n d B r e n d a a n d have a really
w o n d e r f u l time a n d it w o u l d p r o b a b l y be
cheaper than his horrible beefburgers.
Douglas Bader
I'm delighted to see that Douglas Bader and
the author of his official biography (Laddie
Lucas) will be signing copies of the said tome in
the IC Bookshop next Wednesday afternoon.
See Bookshop News (page 9) for details.
The Sound of Silence
Surprise, surprise! Still not a word about the
beef pasties which Mooney has been selling as
lamb for G o d knows how long. Surely this sort
of mistake requires not only an apology but a
public explanation. After all, there are several
groups in College who have been extremely
offended by the whole affair. M r Mooney, on
the other hand, is obviously not treating the
matter seriously.
If I have not received an explanation or
denial by Monday (to print next week) then I
suppose I shall be free to pronounce that M r
M o o n e y is personally responsible, as he
obviously, cares little for the thoughts (or
stomachs) of the students at Imperial College.
So own up Vic—were they lamb or not? If
not, why not? O r are you too scared to
explain.

Blanche and Melanie were deep in thought
over a chess game when Wodge entered the
room and wandered over to the board to
watch. Blanche, as usual, was white and after a
few minutes thought, she played a move,
giving the position shown in the diagram. With
more than his customary politeness, Wodge
waited till the game was over before he started
making comments.

Blanche (White)
" D i d you realise that from the position when
I entered the room, Blanche could force mate
in three moves?" he enquired.
Melanie looked suspicious. "Does it use any
of the funny, obscure rules of chess?"
Wodge laughed, "the only 'funny' rules, as
you call them, are castling and the en passant
rule, a n d neither of them is p a r t i c u l a r l y
o b s c u r e or d i f f i c u l t ; t h e y ' r e just a little
s u r p r i s i n g w h e n y o u c o m e a c r o s s t h e m
unexpectedly in puzzles. But there's no en
passant involved here."
"What about castling?"
"I think you've had enough clues," grinned
Wodge. "Let's see you find this mate in three."
What was the position when Wodge entered
the room? What move did Blanche play? What
should she have played? A n d how did Wodge
deduce that this leads to mate in three? 'Mate
in three', of course, means that White plays a
move, then Black, then White, then Black, and
then White mates.
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. A prize of £5 (donated
by Mend-a-Bike) and two tickets to the IC
Choir concert will go to the correct solution
drawn at 1:00pm on Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
There are two solutions (without counting rota
tions and reflections) and the diagram shows
the less obvious one. Tracy Carter, C i v Eng 1,
can collect her prize on Monday afternoon.
Honourable mention for Antony Broadbent,
Physics 2, who was the only one to find both
solutions.
Sportsmanship
W h e n I've set easy puzzles in the past, it has
been obvious that one or two people have
submitted duplicate entries, either under their
own names (!) or names of collaborators. N o w
while I grudgingly admit that there's nothing to
stop solvers showing their friends the solution,
I'm a little annoyed when such unfair practices
reach the point they did this week, with several
sets of duplicate entries, and even reports of
one mercenary (whom 1 won't name) selling
the solution in return for an extortionate 75%
share of the winnings.
So to protect the interests of those who
solve and enter legitimately, any of you who
are discovered perpetrating unsportsmanlike
s c h e m e s i n f u t u r e will f i n d y o u r s e l v e s
blacklisted, and all your entries will go straight
in the bin. I realise, of course, that such
measures cannot prevent malpractice, but it
will at least f o r c e y o u to d i s g u i s e y o u r
handwriting on duplicate entries.
Christmas Competition
Inspired by M r Humphries' superb letter on
page 2, I'm offering a litre of wine and a large
Christmas pud for the best anagram of any
C o l l e g e personality, b u i l d i n g , institution,
domestic secretary, etc., etc. Closing date is
Monday week, 1:00pm, and 'best' means 'most
appropriate, witty, succinct, e t c '
Other News
Thanks to the choir for the extra prize this
week. The tickets will be in the winner's
pigeonhole by Wednesday evening.
Thanks too, to Grey Spider for this week's
puzzle. After a run of easy ones, this one is
good and difficult!
Finally, I forgot to tell you that the text I
encoded in the 'triangle' puzzle four weeks ago
is the first page of Kit Williams' 'Masquerade'.
