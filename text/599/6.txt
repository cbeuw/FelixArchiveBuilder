Food For Thought
The sad state of IC's refectories
T h e e a g e r l y - a w a i t e d r e s u l t s of the I C U
refectory survey have finally been published,
and as expected, they say nothing that was not
a l r e a d y k n o w n . T h e m a i n c o n c l u s i o n is
that IC catering is unacceptably bad. T h e
report, submitted by Messrs Led wold and
Morton, also contrives to avoid mentioning
anything that could offend the powers on high,
e.g. s a c k i n g M o o n e y a n d l e a s i n g t h e
refectories to an independent company; steps
that would most rapidly improve the lot of the
IC penniless gourmet.
The report was compiled from question-
naires distributed in the four main refectories
(Sherfield, Union, Buttery and Southside) and
in L i n s t e a d . It w a s made over t w o d a y s ,
Monday 26 and Thursday 29 October; Sample
sizes (i.e. the number of forms filled in) range
from the relatively small (100) to the pathetic
(22). T h e questions covered the meal just
p u r c h a s e d , refectory service in general,
queues, cook-freeze food, r e c y c l e d food,
breakfast service, suggested improvements
and increased services, bars, Hall and formal
dinners, the Southside S h o p and "special
.reaction noted from consumer" (vomiting,
rigor mortis?). N o questions were a s k e d
concerning prices, hygiene and cleanliness, or
the "foreign substances" (e.g. staples, ground
glass) frequently found in tbe food.
' N o results concerning bars, Hall and formal
dinners, or the shop have been published, as
m o s t p e o p l e left t h e s e s e c t i o n s b l a n k ;
therefore the compilers may assume that these
services are either satisfactory, ignored or the
results have not been processed.
The published survey includes results, a
s u m m a r y of the results, a n d c o n c l u s i o n s
drawn from the summary of the results. It is
not light bed-time reading and was quite a few
p a g e s , s o h e r e is a " s u m m a r y of t h e
conclusions drawn form the summary of the
results"! All quotes are direct.
The Four Main Refectories
G e n e r a l r e s u l t : A b o u t half t h e p e o p l e
questioned in each refectory were happy with
that particular meal. W e are certain that a
commercial venture would not accept such a
low level of satisfaction.
Cook-freeze foods: "...becoming coagulated
or congealed too many times" (as if once isn't
enough). " M o s t people asked don't like cook-
freeze food, which is unfortunate if you get no
choice for your evening meal."
R e c y c l i n g : " M a n y s e e m to feel they are
getting recycled food."
C l e a n l i n e s s a n d H y g i e n e : " I n e v e r y
r e f e c t o r y t h e r e w e r e c o m p l a i n t s a b o u t
cleanliness and hygiene. Sometimes the point
was made quite strongly suggesting public
health inspectors should be brought i n . "
Staff: " I n e v e r y r e c f e c t o r y t h e r e w e r e
complaints about rude or unpleasant staff."
Breakfast and Weekend services: "Only 15
people admitted to using the breakfast service
often 75 people (over 2 days) said they use
the weekend service often."
Prices: "Virtually everybody said the prices
were too high."
Suggested increased services: "It seems
that approximately half the people asked want
an increase in sandwiches and rolls type cold
food. About a quarter want an increase in the
range of puddings and more fast food."
"there were well over 300 requests for more
barfood."
Other remarks: "There were" (was Marco)
" a huge number of unsolicited comments
about the high quality of the R C A and R C M
refectories."
Eleven Conclusions
1. The refectories simply must improve the all-
round level of cleanliness.
2. The staff could be a lot more pleasant. This
comment should not be taken personally by
any member of the refectory staff. It is an
overall problem of commitment to students.
Students are not the most tactful or diplomatic
breed and all we are asking for is a more
tolerant approach from the staff. This might
generate a better nature from the students and
improve the current relationships.
3. M o r e care is needed in the final stages of
the process of preparing food for students.
These are simple matters; a bit more care in
meal presentation, trying to keep "hot" food
hot, and ensuring correct amounts are cooked
to prevent continually reheating food for the
next session.
4. Someone somewhere should learn how to
cook chips and how not to wreck vegetables.
5. T h e quality of the meat should improve—it
has too much fat or gristle and is often said to
be undercooked. O n this subject the fish is not
too good either, often said to be "soggy".
6. There are many specific complaints about
types of food which could be easily rectified
(e.g. solid baked beans, hard rice pudding,
etc.).
7. Different organisation of queues might be
considered in some refectories.
8. There is a need for a salad bar selling good
quality salads at reasonable prices, possibly " a
la R C A " which got several mentions. This can
be c o m b i n e d w i t h a d e m a n d f o r m o r e
sandwiches, rolls and other cold foods. There
is also a demand for an increased range of hot
food and more variety every day. The question
"what type of food do our refectories cook
best?" yielded no clear favourites, so maybe all
types should be offered; casseroles, roasts,
fries, grills, etc. W e are formulating a hot
food/cold food plan.
9. There is a demand for more food in the
bars. This may fit in very well with the point
above.
10. T h e demand for a breakfast service is
minimal and the justification for this service
must now be questionable. The demand for a
lunch-time service is massive a n d for a n
evening service substantial. T h e demand for
the weekend service is much smaller. Possibly
the survey captured the wrong people for
estimating the need for weekend meals. Either
way we believe the College has a social duty,
as a c o m m u n i t y , to provide food at the
weekends.
11. The food in Linstead is totally unaccept-
able. This situation must be seriously reviewed
immediately.
T h e situation in L i n s t e a d H a l l is that,
apparently as a condition of the presentation
of the Hall to IC by an anonymous benefactor,
all students must eat there at least three times
per week. This costs them £1.27 per meal.
The results from the Linstead survey were
frightening; on Monday 86% were "unhappy
with the quality of the meal". O n Thursday, it
was 89%. T o the question "are you generally
happy with the service in the refectory?" on
Monday 67% were not, on Thursday only 39%
were not. O n closer inspection, however, it
was seen that only 19 people were interviewed
on Thursday compared with 76 on Monday.
This highlights one of our criticisms of the
survey; it was unrepresentative. Allowing for
the fact that a vast number of students never eat
Mooneys because they are so bad, to restrict
the survey to people eating in refectories was
ludicrous. In answer to this, M a r c o Ledwold
claimed that constructive criticism could only
be made by regular refectory users; how often,
I w o n d e r , d o he a n d N i c k M o r t o n eat
Mooneys.
A rough calculation reveals that, if only half
of the people who eat in refectories find the
service satisfactory, this means that between
80 a n d 9 0 % of ail students at I C w o u l d
welcome improvements.
The other main criticism is the rather half
hearted approach to the matter. Refectories
have been a standing joke now for years, and
such remarks as (and I quote from " T h e
Plan").
" A nice fresh sandwich with a cup of tea or a
drink could prove a popular lunch in these
h a r d t i m e s . " a r e n o t g o i n g t o c a u s e a
revolution. It is to be hoped that, having
obtained these results, the Union acts o n
them; remember Nick Morton's promise at the
first U G M of term?
