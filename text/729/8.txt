have devoted many c o l u m n
inches to the 'Great Porn
Debate'; their contents have
not only been tedious in
the extreme, but they have
also missed the point.
Mine's H o n Porn Night is
not the central issue, it is
merely an epitomy of the
problem that is a sexist u
institution. O n e only has to
consider the sexist-macho
attitudes that are prevalent
in many of social and
recreational c l u b s to
appreciate h o w decadent,
in this respect, ImperiaJ has
b e c o m e
In particular, ! w o u l d cite
the Guild's Motor C l u b of a
prime example of a club
which is penially
orientated. It is certainly
not a c o i n c i d e n c e that s o -
called 'Supercars' have
long, sleek bonnets with
nobbly bits attached on
apparently for
'aerodynamic' reasons.
Quite obviously, the
designers of such m a c h i n e s
have based them on their
o w n sexual fantasies and I
for one feel degraded
whenever I am forced to
drive one. T h e Motor C l u b
is supporting this insulting
fervour into a d o l e s c e n c e
and b e y o n d . It is not only
pathetic that fully g r o w n
men do not have
accordingly developed
egos to be able to restrain
the ids, but this ' m a c h o
thing' is also very
fant. The attitude
valent in this society Is
lot dissimilar to that found
in Ernest H e m i n g w a y ' s
adventure stories for big
boys, which generally take
the form:
'Captain Berty 'Big N o b '
B u l l d o g pushed forward
alone, m a c h i n e gun
blazing, he had no fear, his
c o u r a g e lay in his
e n o r m o u s cock...It was
inevitable that he w o u l d
die: his penis was so large
that the e n e m y could not
have missed. T h e captain
died k n o w i n g that he had
taken out at least fifty of
the swine with him.'
Literature is not the only
art-form that has been
affected by the s c o u r g e :
M u s i c is contaminated too.
I refer principally to Heavy
Metal: it is an insidious
form of music that relies
very heavily on sexist
attitudes. O n e could
dismiss the lyrics as
Inspite of this blatant
sexism, IC radio continues
to provide air time to this
pornography. T h u s
s u b c o n c i o u s l y we are being
indoctrinated and
c o n d i t i o n e d into believing
that it is perfectly
acceptable to molest cute,
furry, little creatures.
T h e gross turpitude of
music is not exclusively
c o n t i n u e d to modern day
artists, in fact, most of the
heavy classics are genitally
orientated. For example, it
is rumoured that the
orchestra and choir, both
of w h o s e e m to be innocent
organizations, were
' c o m i n g in their pants'
during their renditions of
the ' C a r m i n a Burana'. It is
not g o o d e n o u g h to say
that b e c a u s e it is written in
Latin then the lyrics are
meaningless'. T o sing
about the rape of virgins in
a different manner makes it
more grotesque by turning
it into s o m e sort of fetish.
This e x a m p l e e m p h a s i z e s
my c o n c e r n that sexism is
prevalent throughout the
whole college since it has
penetrated even the
seemingly innocent
societies.
'Literature is not the only art-form that has been affected by this scourge'
Michelangelo's original cartoon for the roof of the Pristine Chapel, entitled 'You
wanna sign Adam, How's this?'
s y m b o l i s m and revels in the
true meaning of the 'joys of
motoring'. Moreover, all
sports societies have s a d o -
masocistic overtones and
motives—especially the
more 'physical' ones.
A n o t h e r club which has
caught my attention for
their flagrant sexism is the
S c i e n c e Fiction Society.
O n e can understand that
little boys might experience
s o m e enjoyment from
zapping bug-eyed green
monsters but one must
question the mentality of
those who extend this
harmfully nauseating if they
contain themselves to their
pathetic fantasy imagery,
however, they d o not and
are grossly objectionable.
Generally, they revolve
around publicising the
singer's 'huge erect one'
and how he lays fifty
w o m e n a night. I quote the
example:
I was a hobbit/ she was
an elf/she turned me o n / so
I a b u s e d myself/1 was a
h o b b i t / A n d my name's
B i l b o / S h e spread her
l e g s / A n d I rammed in a
dildo.
I c o u l d continue listing
other clubs and their
activities, however, lack of
space prevents me from
doing this. S o , to c o n c l u d e ;
these c l u b s will not c h a n g e
voluntarily, s e x i s m will
continue to flourish at IC
when action is not taken.
Boycott all social a n d
sporting societies a n d
picket the H a l d a n e Library
until all offensive material
is removed from its shelves;
then perhaps we might
have a meaningful a n d
equitable social life for all
at Imperial.
