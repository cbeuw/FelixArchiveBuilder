CONTACT WEEK
1986
What is Contact W e e k ?
Why have those Christians
g o n e to the trouble and
expense of making badges,
printing 2000 posters using
a small mountain of blu-
tack etc? T h e idea is to
make C O N T A C T ! With
Everybody!
With non-Christians to
tell of s o m e t h i n g that
Christianity has to offer
and to listen to criticism
with other Christians to
learn from other traditions
a n d to g r o w together.
T o do this 20 people
from a large variety of
b a c k g r o u n d s are living and
working with students in
College. They will provide a
s o u r c e to lead d i s c u s s i o n s
a n d reflect on their own
e x p e r i e n c e to give help.
T h e y will also be available
for people w h o wish to talk
to s o m e o n e they will never
meet again.
T h e hope is that as many
p e o p l e will benefit as
possible. A s with anything,
y o u only get out of the
week what you put in-there
is an open invitation to you
all.
This week is organised
by T h e West L o n d o n

Biathlons And
Triathlons
A little before C h r i s t m a s a
friend (sadist) s u g g e s t e d to
me that I would like to
enter a race. 'What kind of
race' I tentively a s k e d and
before I knew what I had
rashly signed my body
away to the mercies of the
-irst C l a s s i c Biathlan'.
Held from a s c h o o l near
New Maiden and consisting
of a 5 mile run followed by
a 22 mile cycle, it was
knackering. M y exhaustion
not being helped by the
lack of training (5-10
minutes c y c l e to C o l l e g e
and back each day of this
term.) and the days
freezing early morning
temperatures.
Held last S u n d a y , the day
started well by getting up
at 7.15am instead of a
p r o p o s e d 6.00am s o that I
had to forsake my relaxed
breakfast a n d relaxed 10
mile c y c l e to the start for a
quick bowl of cereal a n d a
quick 10 miles cycle.
O n arrival my hands
began to warm up w h i c h
meant extreme a g o n y as I
had no gloves on on the
way d o w n . Luckily though I
found a sympathetic friend
with a spare pair to hand
that I c o u l d use during the
race.
I layed m y bike d o w n
with the others, in the rows,
together with the gear I
n e e d e d ^ o c h a n g e into
during the transition
period, leaving for the final
briefing 10 minutes before
the off. T h e run was an out
a n d back route, a l o n g an
A 3 slip road, exactly
retracing the outward
journey after the half way
mark. B e c a u s e of this it
was relatively easy to judge
h o w far you had run a n d
how m u c h more effort you
w o u l d afford to put into the
run.
B a c k at the s c h o o l for
the transition point, it was
on with another tap and
grab the bike taking the
least possible time, before
heading off on the s e c o n d
and last stage of the race.
Over taking people at this
stage as I did make me feel
g o o d but c a n be a mistake
it you're over zealous about
it. A s it turned out all
w o r k e d well and with my
ego boosted to start with I
c a m e in 16th. Out of a field
of about 250, the time on
as yet unconfirmed 1 hour
40-50 minutes c o m p a r e d to
the winners 1 hour 20
minutes. H e c a m e in on his
o w n and 6 minutes ahead
of his nearest rival.
Events like this together
with triathlons (swimming,
c y c l i n g a n d running) like
most sports are incredibly
rewarding, especially when
you c r o s s the finish line
and collect your medal.
There is nothing quiet like
the feeling of crossing that
finish line after being s u c h
a masochist to yourself
over s u c h a time and
c o u r s e a n d it really is worth
all the pain. S o if you're
interested, whether
seriously committed or not
contact me, C h r i s Stapleton
via the F E L I X office or the
A e r o 1 pigeon holes leaving
a note if I'm not around of
your name, year, c o u r s e or
other means of contact
together with an indication
of your level of interest.
Just What
You've
Been
Waiting
For....
Rhino's Willies...(And other
things)
Last S u n d a y saw the climax
to the A m e r i c a n football
s e a s o n with S u p e r b o w l 20.
G R E A T . . . g o d o w n the offy,
s p e n d your last pennies on
a few bottles of Special
Brew, sit yourself d o w n in
front of the telly and enjoy
the thrills a n d spills of 'The
Refrigerator' and the like.
Problem; its 8.30, and it
doesn't start till 9.30. Well
what's on now. G o for the
every popular 4 button-
what s this?-some bloke in
a safari suit. 'Oh no-not
another Natural History
programme!' N o in fact 'Pet
Hates' in which s o m e bloke
rants on about h o w sordid
a n d disgusting animals are.
D i d y o u k n o w that w h e n
you overfeed d u c k s ,
b e c a u s e they have so m u c h
time released from looking
for their own food, all they
d o all day is c o p u l a t e ? It's
a big problem for the
female d u c k s to have
twenty horny drakes after
her-(a bit like IC women!)
Did you know that w h e n
a male preying mantis gets
all keyed up and climbs on
the female praying mantis,
s o m e t h i n g in his head
forgets what to d o ?
Solution-female bites his
head off, and the rest of his
body get on with it;-well
the bits that aren't being
eaten do anyway! (Which
bit d o e s she eat last??)
Basically the program
was about this bloke w h o
got incredibly pissed off
about Natural History
p r o g r a m m e s fascination
with copulating animals.
W h i c h leads me to the long
awaited bit about Rhino's
willies...
Well the point is, they're
big, V E R Y , V E R Y B I G .
It's difficult to describe
the general d i m e n s i o n s
without being disgusting,
but put it this way:- your
average female R h i n o must
have receptive bits that run
the full length of her body.
Y o u c o u l d stick your arm
up there no problem. O h
this is sordid drivel-l'll
never stretch it out to 400
words.
