Cave Canoe
Football
T h i s is the s e c o n d least-
known sport played in
Britain' said the President
of IC cave c a n o e football
club ( I C C C F C ) when he
invited me to join them for
a weekend's activities.
'What's the least-known?'
was the obvious question.
'Don't know.' H e replied.
' N o b o d y appears to have
heard of it'.
S o it was that early one
Friday evening in J a n u a r y I
found myself s q u a s h e d into
a rather rundown Vauxhall
Viva heading along the M4
towards South Wales. It
was on this journey that I
picked up gist of the rules
of this curious sport.
Basically, two teams of
five players carry c a n o e s
into a cave system to find a
suitable underground lake
or pool. They then mark
out goals and compete with
each other tryng to propel
a light plastic football
through the goals using the
blades of their paddles.
Light is provided by
traditonal caving h e a d -
torches. T h e sport was
originated in South Wales
by a pot-holing club from
Brian w h o were b e c o m i n g
rather bored with simply
crawling around in the
local caves. They founded
the B r e c o n Seals, easily the
biggest and most
dominating club in the
sport's short history. O u r
destination that evening
was S w a n s e a University,
h o m e of the only other
student's team. It appeared
that this weekend was to
see the very fast U A U
(unofficial) C C F
C h a m p i o n s h i p final. A s our
cars parked on the
university c a m p u s we were
greeted by gales of
laughter from our
hosts/opponents.
B A T C a n o e s (it stands
for B a t h s A d v a n c e d
Trainers) are used by
people learning to c a n o e in
s w i m m i n g pools. They are
only half the length of
'normal' c a n o e s and look
extremely silly. I hadn't
noticed!
C a r r y i n g the small and
lightweight B A T S was
easier than I had
anticipated. 'First
advantage' grinned T o n y
^ Payton-the man
responsible. After we
arrived at the lakeside , a
couple of miner's lamps
were lit.' O n l y b e c a u s e
you're a beginner' was the
reason offered O n my
first attempt I lasted five
s e c o n d s in the highly
unstable B A T before I was
hauled from the freezing
liquid by Ian Pennington
(President) and A n d y
M a s o n (Transport Officer).
After five dips I decided
to sit on the rock shelf and
leave it to the 'experts',
whose minds are about as
stable as their canoes.
W h e n S w a n s e a arrived for
the match, bringing the
referee (a B r e c o n Seal) I
looked forward to s o m e
entertainment. Alas no.
Just prior to the 'flick off

Ten minutes later c a m e
half-time when I discovered
we were losing 3-2 our
goals from Ian Pennington,
who was trying to impress
the ref a selector for the
Welsh national squad). A
series of test matches is
due to be played against
the touring C a n a d i a n s this
summer.
T h e s e c o n d half was less
successful. Ian scored
another but Morris was
sent-off for dirty play
(smashing an opponents
head torch). Meanwhile
S w a n s e a s c o r e d five times
giving a final score of 8-3.
IC were jubilant however,
they expected to lose by
ten or twelve. T h e B A T S
were a c c l a i m e d as a great
innovation (by Tony), a n d
Mark recovered in time to
organise the ritual d u c k i n g
of Ian in the water.
A s we arrived back in
L o n d o n I found myself
considering the minds of
fellow human beings. S o m e
people can find excitement
in the strangest of ways.
' It'll never catch on!....
