RAG
In Britain students
traditionally help raise
money for charity. As well
as being great fun it also
helps to create a better
image for IC. Last year IC
Rag raised just under
£10,000 and it looks like
we're well on the way to
beating this figure by the
end of the academic year.
Most students content
themselves with supporting
one or two events in Rag
Week and forget about it
for the rest of the year but
as Rag Chairman, Jon
Ingham, writes, there is still
lots more you can do for
Rag.
Rag Committee
S i n c e those lazy, hazy days
of R a g Week last term, the
R a g C o m m i t t e e have been
r e c o u p i n g their energies for
the c o m i n g months. B e h i n d
the scenes, o n e of o u r
many enthusiastic first
years has been to the
National R a g C o n f e r e n c e in
Aberystwyth over
C h r i s t m a s and has c o m e
back with loads of ideas for
us to play with. S o , to get
back into the s w i n g of
things this year, the
following events have
already be planned:
Parachuting
M e n c a p are offering you
the opportunity to
experience the thrill of a
life time. A 2,000 foot
parachute j u m p under
expert supervision a n d it
won't cost you a penny! At
the s a m e time you'll be
raising m o n e y w h i c h will
go towards the largest
g r o u p of disabled people in
the country-those w h o are
mentally h a n d i c a p p e d . A
c h a n c e that you really j u m p
at! ( E x c u s e the pun).
What's the catch, I can hear
y o u a s k i n g ? Firstly y o u
must obtain an application
form from a m e m b e r of the
R a g C o m m i t t e e . T h e n sign
a declaration of fitness a n d
obtain a doctor's certificate.
(Sorry all of y o u sufferers
from epilipsy, diabetics
(mellitus), pyschiatric
disorder, drug a b u s e and
s c h i z o p h r e n i a but you're
not acceptable). T h e n you
give £60 bond m o n e y plus
the application form to the
R a g C h a i r m a n , J o n Ingham
(The R a g P i g e o n h o l e is in
the IC U n i o n Office in Beit
Q u a d r a n g l e ) . W h e n your
b o o k i n g has been
confirmed then you've got
to raise a m i n i m u m of £125
in p l e d g e d s p o n s o r s h i p to
make a first parachute
jump. Y o u can c h o o s e the
date of y o u r j u m p so that it
doesn't clash with other
events in y o u r calender a n d
o n c e you've c o m p l e t e d the
basic training and made the
j u m p y o u can claim y o u r
£60 b o n d back on handing
y o u r s p o n s o r m o n e y in.
Don't miss the c h a n c e of a
lifetime. Either c o m e to
today's R a g C o m m i t t e
M e e t i n g or see J o n Ingham
before 7 February.
R C S Rag Trip
R C S U are planning a R a g
M a g S e l l i n g tour in M a r c h
(probably Friday 7 to
M o n d a y 10 March) w h i c h
involves twenty people and
about 5,000 R a g M a g s
travelling around Britian in
two vans. Y o u need a great
selling t e c h n i q u e and a
strong s t o m a c h . Likely
universities to be subjected
to the onslaught are
Manchester, Leicester,
L o u g h b o r o u g h ,
N o t t i n g h a m , B r a d f o r d ,
Salford , A s t o n ,
B i r m i n g h a m , K e e l e and
Warwick. If y o u think y o u
can sell 250 m a g s in four
days then all it will cost is
y o u r food a n d missing 2
days in college. Don't be
put off by the idea that this
is just a 'hacks' tour. It
won't be if y o u c o m e along
with a few friends. It's o p e n
to every student in C o l l e g e
but priority will go to R C S U
M e m b e r s .
Valentine's Day Message
or Hit S q u a d with a
difference. A r e y o u madly
in love with the brunette in
the third row of the lecture
theatre? A r e y o u too shy to
make y o u r feelings k n o w n ?
Well we've got just the
thing for y o u ! F o r only £3
y o u c a n have a special
m e s s a g e and a box of Milk
Tray delivered to your
loved o n e by a dashing,
debonair, y o u n g
e n o n y m o u s p a r a c h u t i n g -
skiier! (All b e c a u s e the lady
loves Milk Tray) All profits
go to R a g .
Please book this 'never to
be repeated' offer with
Kathy in the IC U n i o n
office by T u e s d a y 11
February.
Rag Fete
T h i s year the annual R a g
Fete will be held on
Saturday 26 April and will
be o p e n e d by A n n e
D i a m o n d - s o m a k e a note of
it in your diary. It's not too
early to start thinking about
this o n e and we will be
especially happy to hear
from clubs, societies a n d
hall committees w h o wish
to take part.
Rag Meeting
If you're interested in any
of the above events or in
helping us to o r g a n i s e
m u c h more-or you're a S o c
Rep, then there's a meeting
of the R a g C o m m i t t e e
today at 12.30pm in the
