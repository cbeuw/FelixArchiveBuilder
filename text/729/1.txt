Moonie Blues
Members of the Unification
Church, the Moonies, have been
canvassing in the College area
this week. Calling themselves
the 'Collegiate Association for
the Research of Principles'
(CARP), followers of the cult
were seen trying to recruit
students outside the Mechanical
Engineerig Building on Tuesday
and Wednesday. They have now
been banned from College
premises by security.
T h e Unification C h u r c h is an
umbrella organisation funded
by the Korean millionaire S u n
M y u n g M o o n , and operates
under at least 60 different
names throughout the world.
T h e movement has been widely
criticised for using
brainwashing indoctrination
techniques and exploiting
y o u n g people. T h e
headquarters of the Unification
C h u r c h are at Lancaster Gate,
on the other side of Hyde Park.
C A R P also has premises near
G o w e r Street.
No other L o n d o n C o l l e g e
contacted by FELIX reported
seeing the M o o n i e s in recent
years, although IC security
confirmed that they were
sighted regularly in South
Kensington at this time of year.
I C U President Carl B u r g e s s
described the M o o n i e s as 'bad
news' when he spoke to F E L I X
on Wednesday. He said that
Moonies outside Mech Eng
they were a highly dangerous
organisation who professed to
offer students a release from
the drudgery of work, but in
fact only brainwashed them. He
warned that people who joined
the cult were separated from
their family, deprived of their
belongings, and frequently
ended up 'psychologically
damaged'. Mr B u r g e s s said that
the leader of the M o o n i e s was a
c o n m a n who was feeding on
the insecurities of various
people to fill his own pockets.
He added that they were very
adept at brainwashing
techniques.
Mr B u r g e s s had s p o k e n with
people who had attended
meetings, and said that they
had received a severe
psycholgical battering. 'It is in
our best interest to remove the
moonies from our property' he
c o n c l u d e d .
FELIX Move Latest
College administration have still
not reached a final decision
over the plans to move the
FELIX Office to the north side
of Beit Q u a d . FELIX Editor
H u g h Southey, B u s i n e s s
Manager J Martin Taylor and
Union President Carl B u r g e s s
had further d i s c u s s i o n s with
C o l l e g e Secretary J o h n Smith
last Friday. Mr Smith accepted
the arguments against the
move, as presented in the paper
submitted by Mr Southey two
weeks ago. He was still
c o n c e r n e d , however, that to use
the kitchen area behind the
L o u n g e to a c c o m m o d a t e the
space needs of the B i o l o g y
department, instead of moving
he FELIX office, would put the
U n i o n in a vulnerable position.
Mr Burgess later confirmed
that Mr Smith had agreed that
to move the FELIX office might
be an 'expensive usage of
money which would be better
spent elsewhere'. Mr Smith is
still investigating the cost of the
move.
Professor A n d e r s o n , H e a d of
the Biology Department, s p o k e
to FELIX about the move on
Wednesday. He said that he had
applied to C o l l e g e for more
space for Biology, but added
that how this s p a c e s h o u l d be
allocated was not directly his
concern. H e said that his
department was receiving
external funding for research
into molecular parasitology and
specifically into developing new
diagnostic techniques and
vaccines to help combat
infectious diseases in the third
world. He explained that these
diseases are still the major
cause of mortality in developing
countries.
T o a c c o m m o d a t e the new
research program it will be
necessary to e x p a n d the
existing laboratory facilities.
Professor A n d e r s o n stressed
the importance of this research
work, and added that it would
be best to keep facilities
together to avoid any need of
duplication. He did not feel that
for Biology to takeover the
L o u n g e kitchen area instead of
the FELIX office and Beit Hall
T V L o u n g e would be very
satisfactory. Professor
A n d e r s o n added that in his own
view the p r o p o s e d move of the
F E L I X Office s e e m e d like a
g o o d deal for the Union.
