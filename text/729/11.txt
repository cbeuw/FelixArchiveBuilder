10.00am last S u n d a y saw
12 cyclists gathered at Beit
A r c h in preparation for the
weekly Imperial C o l l e g e
C y c l i n g C l u b S u n d a y R u n .
W h e r e were we g o i n g ?
N o b o d y knew, so we just
a s s u m e d that Martin, our
w o n d e r o u s C a p t a i n , w o u l d
lead the way. T h e weather
was perfect-well almost.
T h e s u n s h o n e brightly
with no c l o u d s in the sky,
but it was a little c o l d .
However, by the time we
got to the A 3 , a favourite
C y c l i n g club venue, we had
all w a r m e d up and were
starting to enjoy ourselves.
S o on along the A 3 - w a s
it to be G u i l d f o r d ?
D o r k i n g ? N o - w e turned off
a few miles before
G u i l d f o r d and s p e d off
towards W o k i n g . B y now,
the traffic and c a r b o n
m o n o x i d e normally
associated with L o n d o n
had given way to fields a n d
trees-lots of beautiful
scenery. After W o k i n g it
was off to C o b h a m where
we p a u s e d briefly to view a
c y c l o - c r o s s c o u r s e ,
d e c l i n i n g the invitations to
ride around the c o u r s e .
T h e n onto Chertsey, where
a friendly little newsagents
s h o p was c l e a n e d out of
Mars Bars and C o k e in our
quest to refresh ourselves .
S o o n we were off a g a i n -
through S u n b u r y a n d
K i n g s t o n , arriving back
h o m e at about 2.00pm.
Overall, the ride was
enjoyed by all, a n d we all
n o w eagerly await news of
w h e r e w e are g o i n g next
Sunday-if a n y b o d y d e c i d e s
before we set off! In the
meantime, W e d n e s d a y sees
us meeting at Beit A r c h at
2.00pm for a short
afternoon ride.
Dramsoc
I normally try to do the
laundry every too or three
weeks; I find it more
convenient to w a s h
everything after I've w o r n
the s a m e pair of s o c k s
twice, t h o u g h o c c a s i o n a l l y
I have to use the s a m e pair
three times.
W a s h i n g by h a n d is
s o m e t h i n g of a chore, but it
is the only satisfactory
solution for w a s h i n g
delicate clothing s u c h as
woollens. For the majority
of us laundry time m e a n s
another e n c o u n t e r with the
washing m a c h i n g d o w n the
road.
W a s h i n g m a c h i n e s are
either top or front
l o a d i n g , oh by the way
there's an A c t i n g W o r k s h o p
on W e d n e s d a y at 2.30pm in
the S t o r e o o m .
T h i s w e e k ' s W e l l s o c meeting
sees Prof I Craft bringing us
up to date with the latest
d e v e l o p m e n t s in the w o r l d of
In-vitro fertilisation (Test
T u b e B a b i e s to you a n d me).
Prof Craft is a world pioneer
in this field and will be
exploring many of the highly
controversial a s p e c t s of IVF.
Later in the term, more
events to enliven y o u r
M o n d a y e v e n i n g s including
T V megastar, scientest and
aged author J a m e s B u r k e
a n d A s t r o n o m e r Prof Fred
Hayle. For more details
wait with baited breath for
the W e l l s o c newsletter-
distributed free to all
m e m b e r s a n d also available
at M o n d a y meetings.
Finally, calling all 1st and
2nd year students.
Elections for the new
W e l l s o c committee will take
place near the end of this
term s o if y o u want to

g r o u n d with a d i s c o into
the early hours.
T h e dinner is formal so
dinner suits must be worn
a n d o n e main rule to

leaving the table or

A s P i c o n o n 4 rapidly
a p p r o a c h e s , great w h e e l s
are turning. T h e local hyper
c o u n c i l have granted us a
licence to serve H 2 0 in all
its forms to those attending
the C o n . A n u n c o n f i r m e d
s o u r c e states that a c o l o n y
ship has been on its way to
this c o n for a c o n s i d e r a b l e
n u m b e r of millenia. T h e
existence of the c o n was
revealed to the captain of
the ship via a time warp,
when the ship was still in
the C r a b N e b u l a .
D u e to increasing costs,
any being with more than
three heads, or six eyes
(excluding c o m p o u n d eyes)
will have to pay an
entrance fee for e a c h head
or part of head thereafter.
However, as the entrance
fee is at the bargain price
of £2.50 or 3.3 galactic
credits (inflation) this
s h o u l d not present too
m u c h of a problem.
P i c o c o n 4 is on February
15th.

T h e r e was a great deal of
consternation at this week's
Q T meeting over the
d i s a p p e a r a n c e of our
gorilla, G e r a l d . I w o u l d like
to inform readers at this
point that G e r a l d
represents no danger to the
general public, mainly d u e
to the fact that he has been
dead for eight years.
G e r a l d is eight feet tall,
covered in d e n s e balck hair
a n d has a distinguishing
birth mark on his left
k n e e c a p .
T h e possibility that
G e r a l d has been k i d n a p p e d
has not been ruled out. In
fact Q T 'sent a c o u p l e of
the boys round' to visit
college g a n g l a n d boss
Harold 'Sideboards'
M c k e n z i e . Mr M c k e n z i e has
had several previous
convictions, including
'Loitering with intent to buy
grapefruit'. A self c o n f e s s e d
fruitophile, s i d e b o a r d s has
just been released from a
c h a r g e of 'making improper
a d v a n c e s to an apricot
under the age of consent'
M r M c k e n z i e denied all
k n o w l e d g e of the theft, a n d
proudly displayed the
unusually large and
extremely rare 'Black
C a n a r y ' given to him by his
A u n t A g a t h a . T h e canary,
w h i c h was m u n c h i n g a
b a n a n a a n d growling at the
time, declined to c o m m e n t .
O u r major fear is that
s o m e h o w G e r a l d has
penetrated the R o y a l
S c h o o l of M i n e s building,
where he will be completely
indistinguishable from the
indiginous savages.
