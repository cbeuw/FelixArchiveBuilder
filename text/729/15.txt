'Much More
Generous'
Britain is m u c h more
generous' to its students
than other developed
countries, Sir Keith J o s e p h
told M P s last week.
In response to g r o w i n g
anger at the a n n o u n c e d 2%
rise in grants for 1986/87
and the threatened loss of
welfare benefits, he quoted
figures produced by
U N E S C O , c o m p a r i n g
amounts given out by
seven countries as grants
or loans for student
support. T h e statistics
s h o w that Britian pays
significantly more (£1367
per full-time student) than
any other country o n the
list, ranging from H o l l a n d
(£281) and the U S A (£104)
to practically no money
handed out by the
J a p a n e s e government for
student support. A l s o
mentioned w a s the
percentage of G N P spent
on student support.This
varied from 0.25% (Britain)
to 0% (Japan). T h e s e
figures, however, date from
1982 at the latest.
N U S Vice-President
Welfare, Vicky Phillips,
agreed that in many ways
the British system w a s
relatively generous, but
made the point that 'This is
something to be proud of
rather than an e x c u s e to g o
round c h o p p i n g bits off it.'
Leaders of the N U S have
for the first time been
granted a meeting with a
minister from the
Department of Health a n d
Social Security, M r T o n y
Newton, to discuss the lack
of benefits. Previous talks
had been with ministers of
the Department of
Education and Science,
and had been restricted to
the issue of grants
regulations. T h e N U S has
planned protests against
what it sees as Government
policy c h a n g e s which have
not been fully debated, a n d
warned that parents of
present and prospective
students are being
antagonised.
What Future
What future can there be
for a country w h i c h won't
invest in tomorrow?' w a s
the question asked of over
5000 Harrods shoppers
who were given leaflets by
IC demonst; ators last
Friday. A r o u n d 30 students,
including I C U Deputy
President Dave Kingston,
attended the lunchtime
protest, which w a s
organised by External
Affairs Officer Grenville
Manuel.
T h e leaflets cited the cuts
in lecturers pay a n d student
grants over the last six years
and attacked the
Governments' proposals to
prevent students from
claiming certain benefits. It
was stressed that money
spent o n higher education
is an investment, essential
for the country's future
prosperity.
Mr Manuel later
described the
demonstration as a 'general
success', adding that it had
been very g o o d h u m o u r e d
a n d that there had been n o
trouble from the police.
Alternative
Green
Paper
T h e Comittee of Vice-
C h a n c e l l o r s and Principals
and the C o m m i t t e e of
Directors of P o l y t e c h n i c s
have p r o d u c e d formal
responses to the
Government's G r e e n Paper
on higher education,
expressing deep opposition
to the document. Both
committees claim that the
Green Paper takes no
account whatsoever of the
needs of the nation in the
next fifteen years.
T h e Vice C h a n c e l l o r s '
'alternative' green paper
contains a wide range of
grievances, from the
Government's 'blinkered
view' and failure to realise
the scale of the problems
being faced,to the difficulty
of running a u t o n o m o u s
universities while
ministerial and
departmental intervention
increases. T h e paper points
out that if funding is cut
below a certain level the
quality of the universities'
work will decline. It also
criticises the Government's
judgement on many issues,
for example the raising of
fees for foreign students.
Another item of c o n c e r n
was the low salary level in
universities which leads to
problems of staffing a n d
morale. T h e paper defends
students' behaviour a n d
rights, against adverse
c o m m e n t s in the Green
Paper.
Back To
The Top
T h e C B I is running a
competition to find '21
twenty-one year olds with a
strong point of view on
how to put the U K back o n
track to the top'.
People w h o will be 21
this year are being asked to
write 1000 words about the
direction British industry
should be going in. 21
regional winners will be
selected and each will
receive £500. A n overall
winner will then be selected
who will win £5000. Entry
forms are available from
any branch of Lloyd's
Bank.

Persons Railcard will be

Violence
Free
T h e National A n t i -
Vivisection Society has
launched a 'Violence Free
Science' c a m p a i g n . T h e
c a m p a i g n aims to secure
for students the right to
c h o o s e whether they
participate in dissection
and vivisection. T h e
campaign's organiser,
Lorraine Walker, explained
that many students were
worried about the
experiments they were
being forced to perform. At
present many students are
penalised if they refuse to
take part in experiments on
live animals.
Record
Jump
High J u m p e r Geoff P a r s o n s
broke the U K outdoor

Saturday when he cleared
2.30 metres in the Pearl
A s s u r a n c e National Indoor

Mr Parsons, a s e c o n d year
student in Mineral
Resources Engineering,
went on to attempt a world
record of 2.40 metres and
only narrowly failed to
clear the bar at this height.
