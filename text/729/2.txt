of the C o l l e g e is to 'teach

level'. The teaching
standards at the C o l l e g e
are so low that C o l l e g e can
not claim to teach at 'the
highest level'. T h i s has little
to do with U G C funding. It
is the result of numerous
old a c a d e m i c s being too

care about students.

The protest also attracted

organise more protests of
this kind. It is essential that
people are made aware of
the need for better funding

Dear Hugh,
I'd just like to say I think
that Mr S e y m o u r has, to
say the least, over-reacted
to the abuse he received
from the 'Bananas'
bouncers. It may have
made him a bit unhappy at
the time , but writing to all
the powers that be is going
a bit far.
In fact, I sympathise with
the bouncer's sentiments in
that I, having met Mr
S e y m o u r six years ago,
quickly came to the s a m e
c o n c l u s i o n that they did.
Nevertheless I agree that
he did not deserve to be
spat on, however m u c h of a
nasty piece of work he
really is.
Yours Sincerely,
Spock
What's A
Hallworth
Dear Sir,
I am grateful to M i k e S t o n e
for his critical report on
Student H o u s e s at Evelyn
G a r d e n s (Ref. 24 J a n u a r y
issue of FELIX). His
remarks afford me the
w e l c o m e opportunity of
underlining the general
difficulties facing this office
over the maintenance and
improvement of C o l l e g e
R e s i d e n c e Stock.
T h e unavailability of
public funds, the dearth of
competent contractors and
skilled tradesmen , the high
density usage of the
a c c o m m o d a t i o n c o u p l e d
with the mis-use of
property and equipment by
the residents are the main
s o u r c e s of the dilemma. A n
additional problem at
Evelyn G a r d e n s has been
the a b s e n c e of the
H o u s e k e e p e r through
illness which severely
affected the on-site
c o m m u n i c a t i o n , c o -
ordination and supervisory
qualities. Given that this list
is only partial, the question
of priorities is in s o m e
ways the most vital one of
all. T h e prime reason for
concentration on the
external maintenance
repairs and redecorations
of the Student H o u s e s at
Evelyn G a r d e n s was to
prevent further
deterioration of the
crumbling fabric. The
suggestion that external
appearance is the priority
for expenditure is therefore
substantially inaccurate.
M a y I also point out that
the observations made by
M i k e Stone are typical,
standard criticisms which I
a m happy to counter from
expenditure on R e s i d e n c e
maintenance and
improvements. In 1984/85,
£436,000 was spent on
H o u s e s as against £159,000
spent on the Halls. T h e
total spent on external
works was £130,000
(Houses-Evelyn Gardens)
and £35,000 (Halls -
Southside). T h e remaining
s u m was wholly e x p e n d e d
on internal maintenance
and improvements.
C o n c e r n i n g the problems
with contractual labour,
there is little point in
increasing C o l l e g e
supervision when we are
surrounded by so many
self-appointed C l e r k s of
W o r k s who appear to be
experts in just about every
trade in the building
profession. It is little
wonder that the w o r k m e n
themselves are so often
c o n f u s e d and bemused or
s h o u l d I say a m u s e d by it
all.
I hope these few
comments, hurriedly
written, will at least serve to
encourage Mr S t o n e to
speak to his W a r d e n , read
my reports on expenditure
and improvements and also
to follow the example of
F E L I X and visit this office
to find out more thoroughly
and fairly what constructive
steps are being taken to
alleviate the c o n c e r n s that
clearly are so close to his
o w n heart.
Yours faithfully
Peter Hallworth
