Facts And
Figures
The Undergraduate Studies
C o m m i t t e e is s e n d i n g
questionnaires to various
g r o u p s in C o l l e g e as part
of its review of teaching
methods. IC U n i o n has
undertaken to survey
students on its behalf to
find out h o w m u c h time
they s p e n d d o i n g a c a d e m i c
A/ork, both timetabled a n d
private study, and on s o c i a l
activities. T h e
questionnaires are being
sent out to A c a d e m i c R e p s
for a pilot survey, a n d a
general survey of all
students will be carried out
within the next few w e e k s .
It is hoped the information
gained will enable student
w o r k l o a d s to be moderated
since s o m e departments
are felt to overwork their
students.
Slow
Response
Liverpool University G u i l d
(the students' union) are
still awaiting a definite
reaction from N U S to their
refusal to pay their
affiliation fees. T h e y have
collected over 2000
signatures supporting their
action. M r A n d y W i l k i n s o n ,
the Deputy President of the
G u i l d , s p o k e to the N U S
Regional C o n v e n o r on
W e d n e s d a y last week. H e
later told F E L I X that he was
expecting to receive a final
invoice and felt there was a
possibility that Liverpool's
delegates might be refused
a d m i s s i o n to the next N U S
c o n f e r e n c e in April. M r
W i l k i n s o n thought the
d e c i s i o n to withhold half
their fees may b e c o m e an
issue in the forthcoming
election for union
sabbaticals.

that Britain obtains about

Eight Of The Best
IC Rector Eric Ash launched boat club's new eight on
Friday. The boat, surprisingly also called Eric Ash, has
already won competitive races since its controversial
purchase at the start of the academic year. In a short
speech the Rector told a small audience that he had done
some sculling during his time as a student at Imperial.
Boat club qoach Bill Mason also announced plans to run
rowing courses for sixth formers in the summer vacation.
It is hoped that this will attract good rowers to the college
and help with the club's attempts to attract sponsorship.
In On The Act
Students living in private
a c c o m m o d a t i o n under a
licence may be able to get
their rents reduced by up
to 5 0 % following a ruling
by a Sheffield judge last
week. Pete M a r d o n , a law
student at Sheffield
University, argued that he
and his two flatmates enjoy
the protection of the Rent
A c t even though a licence
they signed with their
landlord s e e m e d to strip
them of protection against
excessive rents, unfair
eviction a n d bad h o u s i n g
conditions. T h e students
applied to their local rent
officer, h o p i n g that a 'fair
rent' w o u l d be set below
the Â£17 per week they had
agreed to pay. T a k i n g his
cue from a H o u s e of L o r d s
judgement last year, J u d g e
Cottan ruled in favour of
the student's c l a i m .
Students living in L o n d o n
w h o currently hold licences
are e n c o u r a g e d to apply for
a fair rent to be set at the
Rent Office of their local
