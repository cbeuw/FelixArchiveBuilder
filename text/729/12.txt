Imperial's s e c o n d g a m e of
this term s h o w e d the
difference in standards
between the top, and
bottom, of the premier
division. With only ten men,
a n d yet to win in the league
this season, St T h o m a s
looked to be an easy win
for a slightly w e a k e n e d IC
team. However, it was 15
minutes before a twenty
yard cross c o m e shot from
Martin Bradley d i p p e d
under the c r o s s bar, taking
the lead for IC.
IC's s e c o n d goal c a m e
from a free kick taken by
G u y P o p p y and expertly
n o d d e d past the St T h o m a s
keeper by M i k e H o u s e b y
on the near post.
Despite several attempts
by the St T h o m a s defence
to keep the ball out of their
net (including a hand ball,
conveniently ignored by the
ref) M i k e H o u s e b y s c o r e d
his s e c o n d and IC's third
with a flick past the keeper
from one yard after a shot
by Dave L y n n e b o u n c e d
across the face of the goal.
It was this c o m b i n a t i o n
that saw IC go 4-0 up just
before half time with M i k e
H o u s e b y putting Dave 'go
for goal' L y n n e through
and Dave pushing the ball
past the advancing keeper.
T h e s e c o n d half saw
more attempts at the St
T h o m a s goal, including a
25 yard curler from A l e x
L u n g h i w h i c h hit the post,
r e b o u n d e d back into play,
leaving IC flat footed as St
T h o m a s ran past the bored
IC defence and slotting the
ball in the back of the net.
IC were quick to retaliate,
and were awarded a
penalty after G u y P o p p y
was brought d o w n after a
thirty yard run. M i k e
H o u s e b y s h o w e d the first
team how to take penalties
and s c o r e d convincingly
from the spot to put IC 5-1
up.
IC's sixth goal c a m e from
a penetrating pass from
G u y P o p p y to M i k e
H o u s e b y (again in the six
yard area) w h o couldn't
miss from that close!
IC's seventh and M i k e
H o u s e b y ' s 5th was
excellently taken by M i k e
as he c h i p p e d the keeper
from 18 yards after a
searching pass from C h r i s
E n g b e r g .
Altogether a g o o d
performance from IC
especially M i k e H o u s e b y
(need we mention him
again?) a n d Martin B a r n e s
in midfield.

IC's impressive form
continued when they w o n
their fourth consecutive
league game. In conditions
not c o n d u c i v e to g o o d
football with a strong
crossfield w i n d blowing IC
were the first to settle
playing s o m e delightful one
and two t o u c h football. IC's
first c a m e when A l e x
L u n g h i ' s free kick was
played to P a u l Bravery
w h o s e mis-hit shot from 10
yards was deflected past
the stranded keeper.
IC continued to put
pressure on the K Q C
defence with the keeper
performing heroics to keep
the s c o r e at 1-0. IC did
increase their lead when
G u y P o p p y s h r u g g e d off
several challenges before
drilling the ball h o m e from
18 yards. T h e third c a m e
when Paul Bravery
intercepted a back pass
shooting past the
advancing keeper.
IC expected K Q C to
c o m e strongly in the
Wednesday Results
