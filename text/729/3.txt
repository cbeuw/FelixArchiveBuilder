Faith
Dear Sir,
I send m y thanks to Mark
A l d e r t o n for co-ordinating
an excellent Features page
in last weeks FELIX. I
should state now, however
that I a m a n atheist. Like
A n d r e w Pettman I w a s
raised by m y parents a n d
s c h o o l to be a christian,
but when, at thirteen I
rejected my teachings I d i d
not set about to refind G o d .
M y faith was shaken by
b e c o m i n g aware of the
other religions to be found
throughout the world a n d
history. W h y follow
Christianity when I have not
even tried or thought about
any of the rest? O b v i o u s l y
this is b e c a u s e I was born
and raised in a christian
country a n d a baby is not
capable of freedom of
choice. S o now that I c a n
c h o o s e shouldn't I search
for and follow the 'best'
religion. T h e christian
w o u l d say that it d o e s not
matter, that all religions
believe in the same G o d
a n d that it is only in the
practise of worship and
specific beliefs that they
differ. This is true. There is
a c o m m o n thread running
through nearly all religions,
w h i c h is:-
Don't kill, don't rape,
don't steal etc. T h e s e are
ideals useful to maintaining
a stable society and c o m e
more from man than from
G o d as I think Mark
Alderton recognises. S o far
therefore, I s h o u l d be
happy as a pantheist.
However, Christianity a n d
in fact any religion d o e s far
more than u p h o l d the rules
of society. For any
individual everyday life c a n
be difficult to handle. There
are times when everything
goes wrong and y o u have
no friends at hand to help.
It is then that G o d , as a
figurehead, provides the
island of stability to keep
y o u going, he is always
there to look after you a n d
love y o u . In a way this is an
extension of the way
religion is used to explain
the inexplicable. T h e world
is a c o m p l e x and possibly
hostile place, but it all
b e c o m e s quite acceptable
if a benign god is there to
make sure y o u don't c o m e
to harm.
A regular place of
worship is also
Paranoia?
Dear FELIX Editor,
It's not that I'm paranoid
but there are men in
orange jackets carrying
brushes following m e
about.
It appears that during last
term the P h y s i c s Blackett
laboratory was quietly
invaded by R B K and C
road sweepers. T h e r e was a
time when students w o u l d
arrive each morning to
check the letter rack, drink
coffee and generally
socialise. N o w a d a y s they
nervously tiptoe about,
leered at by hoardes of
r o a d s w e e p e r s - s m o k i n g
c o u g h i n g their guts up a n d
pondering o n the finer
points of 'shovellin' dirt'.
N o b o d y ever objected to
an o c c a s i o n a l outsider
c o m i n g in for a quick c u p
of coffee and the use of the
toilets. However, I believe
the situation is getting out
of hand now that the
Physics building has
b e c o m e a regular meeting
place. T h e sight of up to
nine or ten roadsweepers is
not something I or many
other students wish to be
greeted by each morning.I
urge C o l l e g e Security to
rectify this situation
immediately.

Propaganda?
Dear Esteemed C o m r a d e
Southey,
I write in disgust at the
state of o u r decadent
imperialist radio station.
I strongly believe that the
ideologically s o u n d body
that was IC Radio is being
taken over by s c h e m i n g ,
capitalist colonialists, lackeys
of insidious R o n a l d
M a c D o n a l d w o r s h i p p i n g
rotters from A m e r i c a . T h e
station plays nothing but
decadent, boring a n d
morally corrupting, s o -
called 'middle-of-the-road'
filth s u c h as R . E . O
S p e e d w a g o n . A n d as for
the presenters, they are
either c h e e s e b u r g e r eating
c o u s i n s of emperor R e a g a n
or wimpering stooges of
the bourgoise like M r S o -
called 'Automatic Barrier'
w h o s e s h o w is a carefully
calculated blow to o u r free
and democratic cultural
development. If matters d o
not improve rapidly (ie
more of that wonderfully
progressive and
revolutionary group
'Hawkwind') I shall be
forced to listen to the more
culturally s o u n d but
distinctly less funky radio
Tirane.
Yours sincerely

characteristic. This not only
reaffirms an individual
belief, but provides a f o c u s
and meeting place for the
community. Seeing the
other people around y o u in
c h u r c h gives a sense of
belonging, particulary if
y o u recognise that the
c h u r c h extends to millions
of other people. A friend of
mine enjoys going to mass
not only for spiritual
fulfilment, but a l s o b e c a u s e
she gets to meet her
friends and have a chat
afterwards.
These then, are s o m e of
the benefits of being a
christian. A b o v e all they
make y o u happy. S o what
is the p r o b l e m ? W h y a m I
an atheist? Christianity is
not designed to be
questioned. Originally only
the priests c o u l d read the
holy teachings and they
told the people what was
right a n d w r o n g , heretics
were silenced. Even n o w
there is the mysticism of
experiencing G o d , an event
w h i c h we are told cannot
be d e s c r i b e d but w h i c h y o u
will know when you've had
it. S o today, in trying to
analyse G o d , he appears
consistent in himself.
However in analysing the
evolution of religion from
the worship of inanimate
objects, G o d appears a
logical creation of civilised
man. This is a stark
contrast to man being the
creation of G o d . With this
k n o w l e d g e I cannot believe
without w o r s h i p p i n g a false
G o d . In recognising the
purpose of G o d as a pillar
to support m e in times of
difficulty, t h e pillar
crumbles. A placebo will
not work if the patient
knows he is eating chalk. I
can believe in G o d as the
voice of m y c o n s c i e n c e
(itself the result of m y
upbringing and hence
society), but then I a m only
believing in m y o w n
strength of character, not
an external, all pervasive,
all powerful being.
Personally I think life
w o u l d be happier with G o d ,
but I cannot c h o o s e to
believe. In the light of this I
had to answer a n important
question before writing this
letter. Is it morally right to
try a n d spread atheism?
This is not m y intention.
However if I d o not voice
my ideas, they c o u l d not b e
questioned and criticised,
and s o w o u l d stagnate.
What I d o think is
important is that y o u d o
not just ignore G o d ,
whether he exists or not.
Yours (faithfully?)
