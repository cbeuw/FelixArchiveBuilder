K a r a t e
Karate-Do is increasing
in popularity throughout
the world. However with
this increase in popularity,
certain m i s c o n c e p t i o n s
about the principles of
Karate have arisen.
Most people if asked
about karate, will think of
the breaking of bricks and
tiles, or of simple
competitions where two
people appear to attack
each other savagely. Karate
is none of these things in
essence, and to practice it
solely as a fighting
technique loses the
fundamental discipline and
self-control that must play
the predominant role. T h e
training therefore
e n c o m p a s s e s etiquette and
the spirit of humility, as
well as devlopment of the
fitness of both mind and
body. T h e e s s e n c e of
karate techniques is 'Kime',
meaning an explosive
attack to an appropriate
target, using m a x i m u m
power, and originally
c o m e s from the J a p a n e s e
expression meaning to 'Kill
with one blow'. Due to
obvious danger though
competition rules make
contact with an opponent
illegal. H o w can this be
reconciled? T h e target
point is established in front
of the opponents vital
points, and hence the
development of self control
of forms a fundamental
basis for Karate.
The history of Karate is a
development from an art
known as 'Tote', meaning
'the hand', w h i c h was a
fighting technique
developed in J a p a n
a r o u o n d 1429. T h e
J a p a n e s e Empire covered
many of the islands in the
South C h i n a S e a at this
time Karate originated on
the island of O k i n a w a . A s
no w e a p o n s were allowed
by J a p a n e s e overlords, the
O k i n a w a n s used 'open
hand' techniques as a
method of self defence.
There are many styles of
Karate. T h e S h o t o k a n style
emphasizes 'power and
speed'. Within the style
there are three major
aspects: 'Kata', 'Kumite' and
'basics'.
Katu are 'formal
exercises' w h i c h consist of
logical arrangements of
blocking and striking in
pre-set s e q u e n c e s . T h e
'Kata' promote physical
development of bone and
muscle. Additional benefits
are fast reflexes and the
ability to move quickly.
'Kumite' is the art of
controlled free-fighting.
'Basics' are the
fundamental techniques,
p u n c h e s , kicks and blocks
w h i c h form the basics of
the sport.
Progression and standard
in the sport is measured by
the colour of the belt worn.
There are nine belts or
'kyn' prior to Black Belt (1st
Dan). T h e c h a n g i n g of
belts is called 'grading',
w h i c h is a formal
examination of an
individuals ability. Ability is
measured by performance
in a predetermined Katu,
s e q u e n c e of basic
techniques and fighting,
the exercises vary with the
'Kyu' standard aimed for.
IC Karate club has been
running successfully for
several years; training on
M o n d a y , W e d n e s d a y and
Saturday in Southside
G y m .
C a e s e r A n d r e w is a
permanent instructor for
the B u d o k w a i J u d o / K a r a t e

This was the first club
outside J a p a n to teach
J u d o . It was founded in
1918 and has p r o d u c e d a
selection of O l y m p i c ,
European and World

Neil A d a m s and Brian

new Martial Arts centre has
been built.
T h e club regularly
participates in competition.
In the National Student
C h a m p i o n s h i p s , held at
Keele University, the club
took 2nd and 3rd place in
the M e n s T e a m Katu
competition.
G r a d i n g s are held at the
end of each term, e x a m i n e d
by a top instructor. He is
the chief Instructor for
Shotokan in Great Britain
and Europe, Mr K E n o e d a
(8 Dan); one of the highest
ranking K a r e t c h a in the
world and o n e time

The; club is fortunate
e n o u g h to receive top class
instruction and s p o n s o r s h i p

Presently arrangements are
being m a d e for Geoff
T h o m p s o n , four times
World C h a m p i o n , to visit
the club.
Lasf Wednesday Mr Hazard visited IC to give instruction to
IC Karate club. The training session saw Mr Hazard
running the class through some basic techniques, placing
a strong emphasis on good control, technique and
especially 'Kime'.
When performing basic techniques the body should
remain relaxed and tense only at the end of a movement,
when contact is made. This tension is know as 'kime' or
focus.
Towards the end, the techniques were put together into
combinations, with Dave Hazard demonstrating how fluid
and easy the movements can be. To finish off, a truly
spectacular display was produced by Dave and Caesar
Andrews (3rd Dan), IC's regular instructor. Starting with
static kicks and punches, both quick, free-sparing
('Kumite'). This explosive aggression of their kicks and
punches made you wonder if they were still friends!
Dave Hazard commented that: 'IC Karate club is one of
the better clubs I've seen, and has an excellent display of
discipline and attitude.'
Dave, 33, first achieved his Black Belt at the age of 20.
Since then he has won many titles and medals as well as
gaining overall third place in the World Championships in
Japan (1977). He is now concentrating on teaching and
sharing his experiences with his pupils not only in the UK,
but all over the World; in places such as Germany,
Holland and Turkey.
