Some people's idea of the
word 'alternative' is to play
Scrabble with Chamber's
20th Century Dictionary.
These inhabitants of the
edge of existence
occasionally score 20 with
the obscure word Kea';
according to Chamber's, "a
species of New Zealand
parrot which sometimes
kills sheep"—not always,
just sometimes. This is just
as well, since a plague of
blood-crazed, myopic
avians picking off anyone
in a C&A sweater with
reckless abandon would
not be expected to boost
the Antipodean tourist
industry—not to mention
putting a dent in C&A's
share prices. But as it
could be regarded as being
a welcome fate for 90% of
their jerseys it could catch
on as a new concept in
biological control. As long
as Terence Conran doesn't
start buying large chunks
of Australasia you're safe.
Such admirable taste in
clothing is probably
displayed by the legendary
Half Man, Half Biscuit'
(well they don't like Nerys
Hughes anyway) as they
describe life 'Back In The
DHSS' at the Bull & Gate in
Kentish Town on Tuesday
and Wednesday. They were
described by John Peel as
"the best thing since Viv
Stanshall wrote for the
Bonzo Dog Band."
However he also described
'Los Butto Banditos — the
notorious gay Bolivian
Country & Western Salsa
band, who swapped nose
flutes for tracheostomy
tubes claiming they give a
fruitier sound—in much the
same way. Both gigs start
at 7:30pm and cost just
three quid a time. The Bull
& Gate itself can be found
in Kentish Town Road, just
50 yards up the road from
Kentish Town tube.
"Old hippies never die,
they just go on tour," is
one of the quotes from the
Face Companion To Things
Paul Morley Never Said But
Might Have Given Half A
Chance, published this
week. Coincidentally it also
describes the band Haze,
made infamous by their
mole fetish1
, who are
playing the Ruskin Arms in
East Ham on Sunday at
8:30pm. The gig is entirely
free.
Not a million miles away
is the Mean Fiddler near
Willesden Junction (alright,
so it's on the other side of
London, but it's not a
million miles unless Mark
Thatcher happens to be
driving). Programmed by
Mike Stock and Pete
Waterman, and let loose in
a sequined Big-Bin
liner—Divine rolls in for a
more against the wall than
off it performance. It costs
a blue one, starts at nine
and doesn't finish until two.

Leather Bondage Romp
With Sex-Change Vicar In
Cabinet Minister And Nude
Mole Scandal
With falling gates, most
football clubs would give a
squad's worth of arms and
legs for Cabinet Ministers
to resign over which
foreign consortium of
Sardine Trifle
manufacturers buys them
out—it might even start a
new game by the name of
headball. Chelsea, itself,
has undergone something
of a resurgence in form (or
should that read just
surgence?). Unfortunately
the gates have not quite
reflected this. Perhaps it is
just the possibility of
having a bicycle chain
become a new item of
personal jewellery, or the
endless stops in the play
that make football not the
most enticing of spectator
events; being somewhere
between a bit part in
Deathwish III and watching
the tide come in at
Maidenhead.
Fear not. Hugh assures
me that Saturday's game
against Leicester will be
'shit hot'. I feel I can't
comment on the
thermodynamic properties
of excrement—perhaps
those people around
college who keep on eating
the stuff can tell you. All I
can do is recommend you
to go down and watch the
match: It starts at 3:00pm,
and can be found on the
Fulham Road just past St
Stephen's Hospital.
Remember Morph, the
psychotic plasticene bloke
with a pet clothesbrush?
Well he's alive and well,
and suffering a nervous
breakdown at this moment.
He seems to have poured
out his entire life story to
Ken Kiff who then
converted it into a series of
paintings on show at the
Serpentine Gallery just
across the road.
In fact that was all lies,
but it gives you an idea of
what to expect. Ken Kiff's
nightmare people flood
across his paintings,
defecating and melting. In
a sort of visual O'Casey
play, the men are portrayed
as warped and twisted
while the women are given
a rather kinder image, if a
little purple around the
edges.
If you're bored with the
usual old galleries, fed up
with re-runs of old Francis
Bacon polytychs at the
Tate, tired of endless
scenes of Dutch people
ice-skating everywhere at
the National, and generally
sick to death of paying two
quid just to get totally lost
in the Royal A c a d e m y -
then it might be an idea to
try the galleries dotted
around the Green Park
area. For some reason
private art galleries seem to
breed around here—it may
not be long before the area
is overrun by hordes of
marauding art dealers
mowing down IBM salemen
in their Porsches.
Here's a list of some of
the more representative
venues:
Anne Berthoud
1st floor, 10 Clifford St.
Anthony d'Offay
9 Dering St.
Marlborough
6 Albermale St.
Nigel Greenwood
4 New Burlington St.
Waddington
2,4 & 34 Cork St.
Nicola Jacobs (9 Cork
St) is also showing works
by Ken Kiff, this time
illustrations for the 1977
book 'Folk Tales of the
British Isles'.
