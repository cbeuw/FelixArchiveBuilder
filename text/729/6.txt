A h me, the bracing wind
and refreshing rain that this
J a n u a r y has brought are
beginning to lose their
appeal, the enthusiasm with
w h i c h I a p p r o a c h e d the
new term is beginning to
fade, and my grant is, to
put it midly, dwindling.
Nevertheless, other people
do not seem to have lost
heart. Instead of
apathetically accepting the
dregs of the J a n u a r y blues
s o m e (true IC students all)
have d e c i d e d to make a
little excitement for
themselves, by making
even more excitment for
their (no doubt temporary)
friends.
Rose, W i l s o n a n d Melliar-
Smith seem to be the
names to watch if you want
to see s o m e tomfoolery
(yes, the pun was
intended). Within two
weeks they have m a n a g e d
to b a m b o o z l e I C U
President Carl B u r g e s s ,
R C S Transport Officer
Pascale C a r r and IC R a d i o
Station M a n a g e r C w i s
Martin.
Pete (I want s o m e Durex,
and I want it now) W i l s o n
and A l a n (you k n o w I'm
right really) R o s e m a n a g e d ,
after hearing about a
similar offer from the
A m e r i c a n E m b a s s y , to
c o n v i n c e M r B u r g e s s that
the Russian Cultual Attache
wanted a group of IC
Students to turn up for an
informal interrogation.
What's worse, with the
intelligence that made him
president, Carl readily
accepted this offer from the
mysterious Mr D u b l y o k i n ,
not finding it strange that
he s h o u l d receive two s u c h
offers in the s a m e day. Not
only that, but the c o l d war
hotted up as a c c u s a t i o n s
flew from the U n i o n Office
that the Soviet E m b a s s y
had bugged the A m e r i c a n s ,
inviting IC only b e c a u s e
they thought the Y a n k s
know something they
didn't. Luckily, an
international incident a n d
Third World War were
avoided when s o m e kind
soul explained to C a r l that
he had been (shock,
horror) deceived.
Unfortunately, Mssrs
R o s e and W i l s o n still did
not feel that they were
really fulfilled where
practical jokes were
c o n c e r n e d so, to remedy
this, they teamed up with
T o m (sweetness and light)
Melliar-Smith in upsetting
Mr Carr. C l a i m i n g that they
were from Q M C and that
they had abducted Salty
T o m , they p h o n e d the R C S
office d e m a n d i n g Mary
( Q M C ' s mascot) from M r
Carr. B y bringing his
but this c o u l d not (like the
Newsline story) be verified.
Perhaps a nicer practical
joke was played on a
personage by the dubious
label of Alkey. With
compliments of this friends,
he opened the door to his
room to find it had been
wallpapered with pictures
of the round wobbly things.
A passing innocent
bystander heard him ask
(in astonishment rather
than anger, we think), 'Who
was the tit who put tits on
my wall?' But it is known
that (in order to catch the
criminals, of course) he has
d e c i d e d not to destroy the
evidence.
A l s o softened by
w o m a n l y wiles, M i n e s V P
C h r i s Griffin was seen
slobbering over an older
w o m a n last Friday night.
After meeting Kathy Tait's
mother at the party to
celebarate Kathy and J o h n
Inghams's engagement,
Chris was heard to whisper
sweet-nothings in her ear.
Personally, I have always

sweetheart (Jez) into the
d i s c u s s i o n however, they
m a n a g e d to offend him
deeply a n d like any
gentlemen w h o has heard
the honour of his truelove
questioned, he sought to
punish those reponsible.
Indeed, after a particularly
unenjoyable (sober) Firkin
R u n (yes, a C a r r (ouch!)
was driving) Pascale went
into the U n i o n Bar and
threatened the
aforementioned
perpetrators of this
dastardly crime with G B H
(and we are not talking
beer). Undeterred, they
proceeded to play the same
trick on M r Martin,
convincing him this time the
G u i l d s H o n S e c Dave P a g e
had been kidnapped. After
the usual thorough IC
Radio investigation, C w i s
used this piece of
information as a news story
on Newsline. R u m o u r had it
that he turned up at the
appointed drop off point,
thought that the older
w o m a n / y o u n g e r man
relationship was a g o o d
idea (as long as it doesn't
consist of my mother and
my boyfriend), but surely
thirty years is a bit
excessive even for a sex-
starved IC Student!
A n old 'friend' of F E L I X
has reared his head in
college again. A n
unsuccessful candidate for
the F E L I X editorship last
year (who was so well
acquainted with the post he
was standing for that he
had to ask a member of the
F E L I X staff.'How m u c h
work do you have to do for
o n e page?') was, while
watching the S u p e r b o w l in
the U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall on
S u n d a y , helping an
assortment of boorish
males to c o n d e m n F E L I X
as 'communist'
propaganda. At the s a m e
time, he proceeded to
extoll the virtues of F E L I X
as he would have edited it.
Fortunately for FELIX, IC
students voted for s o m e o n e
w h o had seen a typesetter
before and who knew the
difference between a paste
up board and a scalpel. It
does a m u s e me, however to
think of M r B a n t o n fixing a
folding machine, c h a n g i n g
c a m e r a chemicals, or even
working the FELIX editor's
obligatory 70 hour week.
Never in a month of
S u n d a y s dear, never in a
month of S u n d a y s !
J o h n S h a r p has apparently
been letting things slip at
Q T . O n hearing about
A d a m Jeffries (QT
C h a i r m a n ) being attacked
by Stoic's S a r a h A l s o p with
a bottle of vegetable oil his
girlfriend was heard to
remark that the slippery
stuff was getting
everywhere. With a
knowing look he said
simply ' M m m , yes it d o e s
dear, doesn't it,' W e can oly
a s s u m e that the oil in
question was virgin olive oil
or else something was up.
A snippet from student
services now. M r Christian,
warden of Hamlet G a r d e n s ,
has pissed off o n e of his
managers to s u c h an extent
that the poor man has
resorted to b e c o m i n g s u b -
warden of Holbein H o u s e .
Of c o u r s e it may just be
that he wanted a change...
T h e 'sporty
mathematician' mentioned
in last weeks c o l u m n has
failed to recognise himself
while a Holbein resident
has redfacedly been
denying that he was the
culprit ever since F E L I X
was published. T h e real
'droopy' was very
sympathetic about the
' u n k n o w n ' mathematician,
exclaiming that he had
found s o m e o n e else w h o
had his problem. S u c h
i n n o c e n c e in a man is
rarely found.
Well, I'll have to say ta ta
now as I have a pressing
engagement (yes, it's the
ironing again)...sorry about
all the pun-ishment you've
received, I guess I was just
in the m o o d this week (for
puns, dear, for puns).
A n y w a y , lots of love kids:
a n d remember..no one likes
a smart ass.
