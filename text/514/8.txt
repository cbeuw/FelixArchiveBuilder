A . G . M .
What you are about to read is an extremely rare 'Societies Page'
article from the CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY.... and what better subject
to write one about than the Consoc. A.G.M..which was held on Tuesday
20th March. In addition to 14 Consoc. members was Gilly Gillespie, the
London Conservative Students Chairwoman/person/man who arrived
late thanks to the architect who designed the three-dimensional maze
called Huxley Building.
To kick off, the minutes and various committee members' reports
were disposed off with the exception of the Treasure's report which was
deferred to a later meeting - probably only to confirm that Consoc. is
flat broke. Well not every society can afford massive College-wide
wall poster campaigns and huge recruitment drives, especially when as
in our society, the claims by last year's Publicity Officer meant that part
of last year's expenses were added to this year's.
Next on the agenda was the extremely important elections of next
year's committee and just when most people had the impression that for
the fourth A.G.M. in succession all the posts would be unopposed it was
revealed that we have a contested "Morning Cloud' editorship post
between the absent Nick Griffin and John Narborough. By scrawling on
bits of computer paper kindly donated by Stephen Poley, our present
Chairman, the voters elected John Narborough by a majority of 8 to 5 to
fill the post. The rest of the candidates were ratified, though the doctor
said it wasn't serious, and are as follows: -
Chairman Mark Clegg
Vice Chairman Robert Gould
Secretary Sally Heslop
Treasurer Tim Lawes
Sadly, nobody wanted to take the post of Publicity Officer, currently
held by me. There were rumours that Shlomo Godsi was wanting to
stand but since neither did he appear in person nor was his name on the
nominations paper the post was left vacant. So if you, Shlomo, or
anyone else out there wants to stick up posters (Blu tac supplied) and
write the (very) odd article for FELIX then just let our chairman know.
Two members. Sally Heslop and Chris Webb made it known that they
wished to attend the Federation of Conservative Students annual
Conference in Liverpool and since nobody present minded them each
spending £20 of S C O money, they were ratified to be our delegates.
Our Chairman, Stephen Poley then wafted about a rather thick wad of
printed sheets (printed on both sides so they can't be used for rough
paper) which constituted the motions submitted to the F.C.S. Annual
Conference. His suggestion that the examination of these motions, in
view of voting in the priorities ballot, be deferred to a meeting of the
delegates and any interested members of the executive was- gladly
accepted.
Unfortunately, the current Publicity Officer had to leave early in order
to attend a lecture on immunopathology, thus maintaining his (World?)
record of only missing thre (yes three) lectures in the three years hejias
been at I.C.I On that note which is not entirely relevant to the article Twill
conclude, thanks for reading it. Love and best wishes,
Martin Sladdin

COMMUNITY
ACTION
GROUP
Just a little article this week as
there isn't a great deal to say at the
moment, Easter and all that.
The only bit of real information
is that Simon Chandler has
decided to take on the job of Red
Cross volunteer co-ordinator.
This will be the job of organizing
hospital visiting, trolly shops and
the like, as the college Red Cross
Detachment has mountains of
requests for such volunteers but
hasn't the organization to fill them
at the moment. Therefore in future
this branch of community action
will be looked after by them.
I would also like to use this
space to gripe on how no-one
turned up on Sunday morning to
help paint the "providence Row"
place. I suppose with it being
Sunday morning with the clocks
just having come forward it was all
that could be expected but at the
same time there was quite a
reasonable turn out from the
Catholic Chaplaincy at More
House.
Oh Well, see you all next term,
unless there's a soup run tonight.
Bye,
John Whitehouse Chem PG.

The A n n u a l I n t e r - C C U Small
Bore Rille Competition For The
Courtman Shield was recently
held at the Rifle Range in The
Sports Centre. The R . C . S . team
were firm favourites to win and it
was clear that they had done so
before their last man shot. The
battle lor second place was rather
closer with C and G managing to
beat R . S . M . into third place.
