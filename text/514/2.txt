Dear Sir, - 1. So! O u r noble
President, Miss M a r y Attenbor-
ough ehose to call quorum at the
last U G M ( M a r c h 8th) simply
because she didn't like the motion
which was on the verge of being
passed. H o w sickening! The irony
w a s t h a t M a d e m o i s e l l e
Attenborough's election posters
were displayed up at the front,
and the word 'Democracy' was
prominent on them. She knew
what kind of a U n i o n she was
going to be president of, and she
still chose to stand. Simply
because she doesn't approve ol
what the majority of students here
feel does not absolve her from
acting in accordance with those
wishes. Q u o r u m calling is all good
fun, but not when it comes from
the president. It is a pity that
someone who has proved to be so
beneficial to I C U , and has shown
herself to be genuinely concerned
with the welfare of most of her
subjects, should be responsible lor
such perlidity.
2. W i l l nothing placate WTSc. (or
W I S T or P I S T or whatever they
call themselves nowadays)!? The
male strippers were inserted for
their titillation, but they'll be
picketing as usual. I presume they
just like picketing for picketings
sake (maybe they hope to be
picked up?). II, as I assume, the
majority of these pickets are the
type that attend the Women's
s e l f - d e f e n c e c l a s s e s y o u r
illustrious publication advertises,
then I should like to volunteer my
services as a would-be assailant. I
can guarantee a very realistic
performance.
I have the honour to be Sir, in
eager anticipation ofthe return of
The Times, your most obediem
and obsequious servant,
Shlomo Godsi M E II
Dear John, - I feel perhaps that I
should say a few things about the
m a n y i n s u l t s , a t t a c k s etc
launched at me in last week^
F E L I X . Perhaps 1 will taxe them
in order of importance.
Firstly I dislike intensely being
called 'Miss'. I Know that most
people do this in order to annoy
me and I can only admit that it
succeeds in doing so. I see no
reason at all why a woman should
be forced to proclaim her marital
status as though it were of prime
importance whether or not she
has got a 'full time* man. (A
woman without a man is like a fish
without a bicycle - to quote my
favourite saying). For people who
finds Ms. totally unpronouncable
or lor other reasons unacceptable
( a l t h o u g h its accepted for
registration at College and for
... passport purposes) you are
perfectly entitled to call me M a r y .
If you feel this is bordering on
being friendly towards me you
can always call me " t h i n g y " .
A few people attack me for not
behaving the way that a president
is supposed to. M y major problem
is that I think the concept of a
president, as many see it, is
hierarchical and therefore not
very nice. I didn't really realise I
didn't agree with the concept of
being president until I was elected
and I thought that maybe people
wouldn't notice. As far as I am
concerned I am just another
U n i o n member who happens to
do a full time job for the U n i o n .
Contrary to popular belief you get
absolutely no privileges (except
the odd free dinners) by being
president certainly no greater
power (nor should you do). I
therefore object to the fact of
having all the disadvantages of
being president (like working
most evenings and bits of
weekends) and also having my
rights as a ordinary Union
member taken away from me.
A n y U n i o n M e m b e r can call
quorum at a U n i o n meeting and
also campaign for someone to be
elected to any post in the union
(they can also commit slander as
long as they pay their own legal
costs).
II every time someone called
quorum they went out and did a
lot of work to make sure the next
meeting to discuss the subject was
quorate as I did, I can see no
grounds at all for complaint. I
certainly don't call quorum
indiscriminately - in fact once in
six "years - and it was based on a
personal decision that such an
important decision - involving the
issue of vast repression in South
Africa, could not be taken at an
inquorate meeting.
M a n y p e o p l e c h a l l e n g e
quorum just because they are
oored with a subject and can't be
bothered to argue it out. I can
understand getting annoyed with
someone in such circumstances - it
has happened to motions I
support all the time. But I have
never been self righteous about
my feeling annoyed. Anyone can
call quorum whenever they like.
W e can only ask them to be
responsible.
M a r k Ciegg is obviously
completely unable to read or pay
attention to U C M ' s because I
disagreed with the Ireland motion
enough to have a written
amendment which I spoke to ai
the meeting. Furthermore, I am
not out of touch with U n i o n
members, I just don't necessarily
#gree with them! This is not a
change. I have always supported
lost causes at U n i o n meetings -
being in a minority position does
not frighten me. Surely I have the
right as a U n i o n member to put
forward my own personal views as
long as my actions as U n i o n
President are based on concern
for U n i o n policy and as long as I
make every possible effort to
inform the U n i o n of what is being
done on their behalf. That is what
I meant by my election slogans lor
a compaigning, democratic and
informed U n i o n .
I did support an election
candidate. I do not believe that
U n i o n members are total sheep
w h o f o l l o w w h a t " h i g h e r
authority" tells them (and if they
are it's about time somebody
educated them out of it). I have
campaigned for Presidential
candidates for the last 3 vears
(1976 Nigel M i l l e r got 130 votes,
1977 Peter Chalk got 260 votes
and me in 1978 got 1023 votes)
mostly unsuccessfully.
Yours non-hierarchically,

Dear Sir, - We would like to make
our views on South Africa quite
clear:
(i) We wouldn't work there
(ii) Like any fundamental
injustice we hope apartheid soon
comes to an end.
We were obviously glad to sec
our proposal on job recruitment
passed at the last U . G . M .
However we felt it was not
interpreted in the spirit it was
intended and therefore thought it
was necessary to make known the
points above.
Yours sincerely,
M a r k Clegg

Dear Sir, -1 write to answer M i c k
Berry's letter in last week's
F E L I X about I.C. Radio's recent
programme changes. I am
pleased to see that he is
concerned, even though he does
not agree with our policy. The
changes followed many long
discussions (late into the night!)
within the station. We felt the
specialist p r o g r a m m e s were
creating much negative feedback
with little positive response.
Because our potential audience
is small, we must be sure that any
minority programme reaches a
large portion of that minority.
This did not appear to be
happening. For example, Opus
301, our classical slot, could not
compete with the wider scope and
superior sound quality of Radio 3.
R 'n B, disco, heavy metal, and
U.S. Rock can all be heard in our
general programming.
M r . Berry is unfair in calling
our output "mindless pop". The
station's presenters have a great
deal of individual choice as to
what music they play, and I feel
that this gives a far wider range of
musical styles than on most other
British radio stations.
The station's aims, set out in
our constitution, are: to provide
an immediate news service, to
relay information of college
events, and to entertain hall
residents. In order to achieve the
first two of these, we must iiave a
reasonable number of listeners.
C o n s e q u e n t l y , o u r g e n e r a l
programmes are directed at the
widest audience possible.
Since the changes, we have
been giving more attention to
good non-music programmes,
such as our extensive coverage of
the sabbatical elections, and we
intend to expand further in this
direction. Next term we are
r e p e a t i n g C a p i t a l R a d i o ' s
excellent documentary "Bedsit
J u n g l e " , to help listeners find
acommodation next session.
I hope M i c k now understands
the reasons for these changes; I
would be pleased to discuss any of
these points with him if he should
so wish.
Yours sincerely,
John Allen,
Station Manager, I.C. Radio
Dear Sir, - It has been brought to
o u r a t t e n t i o n that b l a t a n t
discrimination is being practised
by the College authorities. F r o m
deep within us we feel that this
uncomfortable predicament must
be brought to the surface. It
appears that most of the mens'
toilets in college are supplied with
hard scratchy (and noisy) toilet,
paper, while most ofthe womens
are provided with soft, pink, two-
ply toilet tissue (except in Botany -
are they hardened to it?)
We men must not sit idly by
and let this sexism pass unnoticed.
Let those of us of a senstive nature
stand up and lodge a protest.
W i t h the backing of a mass
movement a motion could be
presented to a U G M and an
attempt made to rectify this harsh
situation.
Yours etc.

Dear M r . Harris, - One at my
agents informs me that doubt has
been cast on my existence. I refer,
of course, to the letter of J a n
Czernuszka which appeared in
your esteemed organ last week.
M y existence is beyond doubt,
and furthermore, when the time is
right, I shall be swept into power
by the multitude of my faithful
supporters and shall immediately
institute a change in the 'fabric of
our society'.
M a y such mindless cloons as
M r . Czernuszka take warning.
Yours in indignation,
Jan Czernuska
Dear Sir, - Rastus has noticed that
big white chief J o h n Harris has
been censoring his articles. Big
white chief J o h n Harris had
better stop doing this otherwise he
will either;
(i) be made to play a frame of
snooker against A l Leclezio, when
A l is in one of his better ("I can't
play on this table! A n y other
table! any other table!") moods,
or
(ii) become R a s t u s ' Easter
Sunday lunch.
Yours sincerely,
