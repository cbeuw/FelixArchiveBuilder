California Suite (AA, Herb Ross)
The Royal Film Performance
1979.
Having seen this film at 10.30 on
a Monday morning my recollec-
tions may not be too accurate.
Well, I did beat the Queen to it
anyway. This is the latest in a
string of films based on the plays
of American writer Neil Simon.
The star-studded cast includes
such greats as Michael Caine,
Alan (M.A.S.H.) Alda, Bill Cosby,
Walter Matthau, Jane Fonda and
more.
The setting is the world famous
Beverly Hills Hotel, cocktails, sun,
palm trees and all. Five separate
couples converge on the hotel for
various reasons and through the
observation of their separate
stories an original, amusing plot is
obtained. The various progress-
ions in personal relationships are
heavily exploited to create some
hilarious moments. In an effort to
avoid giving away too much of the
story, I can only list the various
couples.
Diane Barry is an actress who
has been nominated for an Oscar
award and arrives from England
with her husband Sidney. Hannah
and Bill Warren are divorced and
are both seeking custody of their
daughter. Bill Cosby and Richard
Invasion of The Body Snatchers
(X, Philip Kaufman)
This remake of Don Siegel's
1956 classic is bound to arouse a
lot of interest over Easter, but is it
worth it? A l l of this and more will
be revealed below
M a t t h e w B e n n e l l ( D o n a l d
Sutherland) is a public health
inspector who is in love with his
a s s i s t a n t E l i z a b e t h D r i s c o l l
(Brooke Adams). She, however, is
living with Geoffrey who has been
acting very strangely lately. It
sounds a bit like "Crossroads" but
this is the relationship which leads
Matthew and Elizabeth to believe
that alien beings have invaded
Earth and are taking over human
bodies. Their fight for survival is
aided by friends, including Dr.
David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy),
and opposed by masses of
emotionless aliens.
After a poor start the film
accelerates to an exciting pace.
The aliens seem unbeatable and
are given a quite u n u s u a l
treatment. T h e people taken over
Pryor play two doctors who are
intense rivals. Marvin Michaels is
the inevitable innocent party,
whose wife arrives to find a
woman in his room.
With all of these couples, love
and marriage are the common
factors. The way in which these
are dealt with is very funny, but
there are some very serious and
moving scenes. This is especially
true for Diane Barry (Maggie
Smith) and Sidney (Michael
Caine). Fine performances from
both actors are a pleasure to
watch. Neil Simon is extremely
clever in that there is no limit on
the types of comedy he can
introduce by keeping the film as
four separate stories. There is
slapstick as well as some very
clever (dare I say) intellectual
humour.
This film has something for
everybody and should not be
missed if you like "situation-
c o m e d y " t y p e t e l e v i s i o n
programmes.
That is not to say that it is like a
cheap midweek television show.
On the contrary, the money and
acting talent has been used
carefully to produce a polished
and very enjoyable comedy.

"Hey! Do you know what you are?
You're an asshole! AX ASSHOLE!"
Yes, Dirty Uncle Frankie is
back! Sheik Yerbouti, a double
semi-live album, and his first since
signing with C B S from Discreet
Records, is certainly what Zappa
fans have been waiting for.
Showing much of his old
i m a g i n a t i o n , a n d q u i r k l y
shrugging off the "Sleep D i r t "
disaster, /ierdo takes the stage
again.
The album's first track, "I have
been in y o u " , promises much with
its interesting lyrics, interplay
between lead a n d backing vocals
and line sound quality. This
catches the ear and it is at this
point that one realises that the
vocals are not the original
recording, but an overdub onto
the live backing track, which was
taken from a recent Hammer-
smith Odeon performance, as was
a majority of the album's
material. This eoupled with the
interesting feature of editing each
track into the next, rare for a
studio or live album, maintains
the flow of sounds. "Broken
Hearts for Assholes" is typical
Zappa; a sort of cross between
insanity and Jazz-rock, which he
combines with his penchant for
audience abuse.
Nothing on side two. on which,
incidently, we have moved to the
new York Paddladium, is worth a
mention, including two half-
minute tracks, until the superb
"Bobby B r o w n " - a sort of "look
at me, I'm proud to be A m e r i c a n "
take off, about a guy who loses his
bearings; Zappa in fine form. T h e
last two tracks are from Berlin.
and frankly they sound like
Focus on a bad day, which is true
of much of the patchy material on
this album.
Side Three is the highlight and
possibly worth the asking price on
it's own. T h e short " B a b y
S n a k e s " goes straight into
" T r y i n ' to G r o w a C h i n " , a song
with a persecution complex if ever
there was one; " W h y a m I livin'? I
wish I was dead. Please kill m e . "
Get the picture? We've heard it
all before but what the heck.
A bit of applause, the first on
this " l i v e " album, and we're into
" C i t y of T i n y Lights", featuring
guitarist. A d r i a n Belew on vocals.
Possibly the strength of this
sequence is the interchanging
between vocalists, also including
drummer. Terry Bozzier. Back to
Zappa now on " D a n c i n ' F o o l " ,
soon out as a single. This takes the
whole disco scene and rips it up
piece by piece. T h e suave pick-up
artist also suffers; "Hey Darlin'
...Can 1 buy you a drink?
II ail a minute I've got il... You're
Italian! Hah?
Yer Jewish? Love your nails ....You
must be a Libra."
If you don't buy the album, at
least treat yourself to this
excellent single.
The final track on side three,
"Jewish Princess", is peppered
with sexual innuendo and as such
should pick up bans all over the
place, although I'm sure I C
Radio will be playing it.
Side Four is terrible - Forget it.
Unless of course you're a Z a p p a
freak in which case it's probably
right up your street.
W e l l that's your lot; I'll be back
after the Easter Break taking a
look at some of the records that
come out in the meantime.

to rid the world of the invaders.
The conflict which follows is very
interesting and, thanks to some
excellent camera work and a fine
sound track, the film succeeds in
mm
Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) captured by aliens
making you feel that you too are
threatened.
The film has several drawbacks
however. It is not one of those
r e a l l y m e m o r a b l e m o v i e s ,
p r o b a b l y b e c a u s e o f t h e
outrageous story. Far too many
"red herrings" are thrown in which
may intrigue a few but confuse
most. The most ridiculous thing in
my mind was the inclusion of
" A m a z i n g G r a c e " i n t h e
soundtrack at an inappropriate
point. Why this happened I just
don't know.
To summarise I would say that
even though parts of the film are
spurious and dull, it is generally
very entertaining and shocks in
the desired way. Remakes are
very difficult and this must rank as
one of the best, if only for the
appearance of Don Siegel and
Kevin McCarthy (a star in the
original) as extras. Even if you've
seen the original y o u could really
enjoy it. The large publicity
campaign may also mean you
can't avoid it!
