Not a lot has happened since
my last a r t i c l e h e n c e t h e
shortness of this one.
C o n g r a t u l a t i o n s to G u i l d s
Hockey Team for winning the
Stephenson's C u p match against
r.c.s. the score was 1-0.
However, despite my prediction
and the support of about 15
intrepid (insane?) Guildsmen who
braved the rain and freezing wind
to encourage the Guilds Rugby
Team in the Sparkes C u p against
mines, we lost. The Guilds team
made a brave attempt against a
strong mines team and were
leading at half time. Mines took
advantage of the wind and their
greater weight in the second half
to win the match 17-10. This
means that mines win the Sparkes
cup unless r.c.s. performed a
miracle on Wednesday.
The only coming event of
interest in the near future is the
Four Year Course Reception, this
is at 7.00 p.m. next Tuesday in the
S.C.R. Sherfield and consists of a
slide show of Guilds events and a
chat with the 4 Year Course
students, most of whom are in
industry at the moment.

RCS WIN AGAIN
The Rifle Competition was
followed by the Pistol M a t c h for
the Hungtindon C u p . T h e
outcome of this event was much
less predictable due to the
inconsistent standards of many of
the pistol shooters within the
clubs. Once again the winners
were R . C . S . with an under-
strength C and G team coming
second.

You may have read about the
FELIX constitution that was
recently accepted by publications
board. Just in case you thought
FELIX was only a newspaper that
appeared at various places on a
Friday morning, I'll outline what
FELIX as a society has to offer:
(1) Excellent opportunities to
learn s o m e t h i n g of h o w a
newspaper is produced and in
particular how FELIX itself is
planned, typed, pasted up etc.
right through to distribution.
(2) Use of the magnificent
facilities that exist in the FELIX
Office(s). Advice will usually be
on hand if needed.
(3) Your big chance to work on
FELIX, meet the boss and find out
what he spends his sabbatical
on.
(4) Fun; 'cos we promise there
will be the odd social event.
WHY NOW?
Please, don't say "I'll wait 'til
next year". We need you so badly
that we're going to slash our
prices so you'll only be asked to
fork out 30 p instead of 50 p for
nextyears membership, if you join
now.
DO IT NOW!
Walk boldly through those
infamous guillotine swing doors.
Focus on the someone who is in
the office (He's the Editor) tell him
you wish to join FELIX, (and also
how to spell you name) and make
a quick exit in case he doesn't
forget to ask for your money.

IC I v ISLINGTON III
After a fine 7-1 victory over Wood Green, the first team travelled up to
Islington, confident of maintaining its challenge for promotion to the
premier division next year. On arriving, we discovered that the
opposition was much weaker than anticipated and so looked forward to
another convincing win.
The match started well with Chris Callow obtaining a big advantage
out of the opening on board 6 and Bob Coles, on the board above,
picking up an extra.pawn by neat tactical play. The opposing captains
quickly drew a very boring game on board 1 and when Dave Lock
refuted an unsound sacrifice the match looked over.
However Islington fought back. O n board 4, Shahin Rouhani tried too
hard to force a win and blundered away a piece and the game. J o h n
Freeman fell into a prepared bookline, sacrificed unsoundly and, in
time-trouble, lost his queen. At this point, Islington seemed to have
chances of saving the match as, on board 3, Pete Anderson was
struggling to maintain an equal position and on the bottom board,
Damian Hassan, although a pawn up, could not break through his
opponent's defenses.
Fortunately, Pete managed to draw and B o b duly won a fine game
leaving the match tied at 3-3. A s both Chris and Damian have won
positions, IC look certain to score another victory although not in as
convincing style as expected.
IC I v C E N T Y M C A D R A G O N S
Despite a disappointing performance against Islington, the same
team was selected to play against the division 1 leaders. Centymca
Dragons. This was a crucial promotion match with IC needing a win to
have any chance of promotion this season.
Although an IC victory seemed unlikely, our chances were enhanced
when the opposition arrived with only 7 players, defaulting on board 7.
Prospects looked even brighter when Bob Coles obtained a positionally
won game and Pete Anderson held onto two extra pawns, sacrificed by
his opponent, without obtaining an inferior position. On board 6, Chris
Callow was forced to accept a draw by perpetual check and Dave Lock,
promoted to board 4, drew quickly, missing a simple win on the way.
John Freeman recovered his early season good form and smashed up
the London U-10(!) champion, N. Carr, on board 2, accepting all his
opponent's sacrifices on the King-side and then destroying him on the
Queenside. (Carr was handicapped by his size, being unable to reach
past the fourth rank). On the top board, Phil Maguire lost a pawn to a
strong opponent and, although managing to survive a wild time-
scramble, was never able to overcome this material deficit.
Meanwhile Pete Anderson had converted his advantage to a win but
Bob Coles had erred and was fighting for a draw. Damian Hassan, on the
bottom board, was also struggling in a difficult position and by the
adjournment the match was poised 4-2 in IC s favour, with B o b and
Damian still to finish. A draw from either game would secure victory for
IC and leave the team with a good chance of promotion to the Premier
Division.
