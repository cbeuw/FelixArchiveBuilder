If there is anyone still out there on planet
I.C. reading this FELIX, then this report was
worth writing (if not worth reading!).
In chronological order of matches played:
I.C. IV v AMALG. DENTAL (Home) 9-0
A well-drilled fourth team played like a gas
with Lambert and Cobrin winning all three
sets for the first time ever Rutherford of
course did his usual bit.
I.C. Ill v. BARBICAN Computer Centre II
(Away) 4-5
The match was finally resolved in the 8th-
set, when I lost21-18inthe3rd game and thus
left the score 4-4. A s the final match was
against B A R B I C A N ' s top player, the eventual
4-5 defeat was a formality, though Reed made
a gallant effort. He won one of his three sets,
Stean won two, and me one.
I.C. II v. EAGLE III (Home) 7-2
Much discussion took place on the subject
of Sobhanpanah's and Ugoala's serves. It was
resolved (partly) when I commented that one
of the Eagle players had an equally "illegal"
serve. I.C. eventually won a tense match
thanks to Farzin (3 sets), Tye (2 sets) and Eze
(2 sets).
I.C. IV v. D of E IV (Home) 6-3
Weng Leong (with my bat!!) pulled off three
great wins and with Lambert (2 wins) and
Cobrin (1 win) ensured victory.

For the second time this t e r m the
presence of IC runners in Cambridge
has brought blizzards, on this occasion
for the Boundary R u n , an annual 26 mile
trot around the city, to be completed
within 6 hours.
The 153 starters struggled in driving snow
over a first five miles of ploughed fields before
hitting roads for the next fifteen miles, all but
the leading pack of four taking advantage of
Mars bars supplied at 14 and 19 miles out.
The last 6 miles of a marathon are bad
enough without including a league of muddy
fields, with fences, ditches and railway lines
to traverse. Navigational error took its toll,
routing arrows having been stolen: our own
M a r k Pickard was misdirected onto a short
cut, taking h i m to the finish in first place,
honesty and a four minute penalty reducing
him to 3rd in 2 hrs 48 mins 20 sees. First place
was taken by Cambridge's Chris Hirst in
2.44.20, with M . Ellison one minute behind.
The two-man Imperial team was completed
after 3.10.06 when Geoff Sherwood,
disguised as an icicle, staggered into the finish
in 7th place, causing the snow to stop in so
doing.
With the competitive season drawing
to a close, this is the time of year when
clubs settle internal rivalries and give
one another trophies, I.C. are no
exception. Last Wednesday saw the
annual club 5000m race, held at a
w i n d s w e p t a n d r a i n - l a s h e d West
London Stadium. For several weeks
past Ian M o r t o n had been m a k i n g daily
trips to the Union Office in order to eye
up the rather impressive piece of Silver
which the winner holds for one year,
such was his desperate desire to win,
and so break the domination of recent
years by the Physics Dept.
He even took his war of nerves to the length
o f a late arrival in order to shatter the spirits
of his rivals. W h e n the race got underway it
was the fast starting M a r k Thwaites a n d
Danny Clarke-Lowes who set off at a
blistering pace. Soon Stu Littlewood and
M a r k Pickard took the lead with Bryan
Acford and M o r t o n close behind. A t the
2000m mark Acford made his move, (with a
notable lack of success) he held the lead for 3
laps until M o r t o n skated through, a n d
proceeded to storm onward over the final
1500 m and eventually slipped and slithered
his way to a fine (if lucky) victory in a
respectable 16 mins 15 sec. H e was followed
in by Littlewood and Pickard in the "silver"
and " b r o n z e " medal positions. Little Ian's
delight was somewhat tarnished, however,
when he discovered that he would be
required to fill the cup to its full 6 pint
capacity.
Saturday gave us the annual race against
the O l d Boys and by 3:30 p m there were a
mere 14 individuals at the start. T h e thought
of splashing around R i c h m o n d Park
evidently being considerably less attractive
than sitting in front ofthe T V watching the
Boat Race a n d the Rugby and downing a
quiet gallon. As was eventually inevitable,
hangovers caught upon Ian M o r t o n and he
didn't arrive at all. This only served to lift
Acford's spirits to a previously unknown high
as he scented a maiden victory. R i c h
Harrington was obviously of the same
opinion as he tried to persuade each
competitor, in turn, to give a bit extra and try
to " W o b b l e " Acford. But the " C a r t h o r s e "
was not to be denied and he steamed off in
fine style without even pausing to glance
behind. Some even claimed to have seen
smoke issuing from his ears as he carreered ofl
into the distance. Acford was a convincing
victor with Ian Isherwod winning the tustle
for 2nd place from the ageing Chris James.
Fourth home was the aforementioned
Harrington enjoying a glorious swansong.
The remaining finishers being, in order, G a r y
Longhurst, A l f Garnett, Ian Alvey, Dave
Cleator, M a u r i c e Wilson, Dave Briggs, Pete
Johnson, M a r t i n Tarnowski, Dave Jones and
finally M i r i a m Rosen. T h e result was rigged
in order to achieve the traditional draw.
This almost marks the end of the season,
but for those of you who enjoy shorter

Friday 16th March
Hoist: Hymn of Jesus
Rossini: Petite Messe Solennelle
If the last week at IC is any indication, then the music of Gustav Hoist
is enjoying a vigorous revival, if indeed it has ever been neglected. Last
week DramSoc chose for incidental music the best known of Hoist's
music, "The Planets", and on Wednesday the Wind Ensemble
programme featured more of the music written by this composer.
On Friday the IC Choir, under the direction of Professor Eric Brown,
performed Hoist's "Hymn of Jesus", a piece written only two years after
"The Planets" at the end of the Great War. Despite its origin in such
turbulent years, the Hymn is calm, reflective and full of sustained voices
reminiscent of "Neptune, the mystic". Its text is a setting of early
Christian writings, from the "Apocryphal Acts of St. John", and was
translated by the composer himself. The piece is dedicated to Ralph
Vaughan Williams, who had also studied under Stanford at the R C M .
The Hymn opens with an unaccompanied plainsong melody from a
trombone (a solo in this performance rather than the stipulated pair in
unison). The prominence ofthe trombone is no doubt attributable to the
composer being himself a player of that instrument. O n this occasion
the orchestra was extremely competent, although the strings had some
difficulty with the asymmetrical rhythms at the beginning of "Divine
Grace is dancing."
At times the plainsong themes and the use of a small male semi-
chorus evoked a rather monastic atmosphere, but for the most part the
music was luxuriant rather than ascetic, with long high descants (in the
original sense, of a melody sung above the plainsong) and bell-like
chords from the orchestra. A s in many other pieces by this composer,
the bass line is predominantly a heavy, treading scalic descent, a sort of
anchor which prevents the chorus from drifting away from the Earth
completely.
The harmonies employed by Hoist are chromatic, often unusual and
very effective. Great beauty is achieved by a careful use of dissonance
rather than from saccharine consonances. A n example is the "Glory to
thee, Father", where the last word is accented and enhanced by first a
major chord, and then by one of the most harmonically remote chords
possible (for those of a technical disposition, the minor triad a tritone
distant) as the lower strings plunge into their descending scales.
The Rossini piece is an interesting choice for the Choir, since it has a
strong emphasis towards the soloists, with few opportunities for the
chorus to come into the foreground. Perhaps this enabled the Choir to
save their energies, since the choruses were very brilliant. This Writer
was particularly impressed by the " C u m Sancto Spiritu" of the "Gloria",
for which one could not imagine a finer performance. The soloists were
highly competent, and Jeffrey Cresswell's singing of the "Domine
Deus" was particularly enjoyable.
The "Petite Messe Solennelle" is a piece which I had heard only once
previously, and I suspect that it was less familiar to most ofthe audience
than Rossini's earlier "Stabat Mater". Although Rossini is best known
today as a composer of opera, he also turned out quite a few sacred
pieces. The "Petite Messe" is not particularly short, nor is it noticeably
more solemn than any of these other pieces. Indeed, the earlier sections
abound with cheerful little tunes, many of which are thrown away quite
casually, which would not have been out of place in any Rossini opera,
and the Mass only becomes solemn towards what would presumably, in
liturgical performance, be the actual Celebration. The Choir seemed to
be more confident in the conventional harmonies and melodies of
Rossini, and they achieved some beautiful tone with accurate singing,
right up to the long and intricate final Amen.
