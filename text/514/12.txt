NEWS IN BRIEF

A R R E S T E D
Boris Kalendarev, the Soviet
Jewish student adopted by I C
U n i o n last year, has been arrested
by Soviet police. It is expected
that he will be charged with
evasion of conscription, which
could lead to a sentence of three
years in a labour camp.
The U n i o n has responded with
protest telegrams to President
Brezhnev a n d U S S R State
Prosecutor Rudenko. U n i o n
President M a r y Attenborough
has also written to Foreign
Secretary D a v i d O w e n and Peter
Brooke, M P for Westminster,
asking them to urgently take up
Boris's case.
She has also sent a letter to
Rudenko strongly urging him to
release Kalendarev and saying
that his arrest is "in flagrant
defiance of the Helsinki agreement and
breaches every acceptable standard of
human rights.
21 year old Boris has been
trying to emigrate from the Soviet
U n i o n . H e applied for an exit visa
in 1973 three years before he was
eligible for military service. In
1977 he was expelled from
College for applying to emigrate i
and since then the Soviet
authorities have tried to force him
into the army.
IC U n i o n along with other
student unions adopted Boris as
part of a national campaign in
support of the right of Soviet Jews
to emigrate to Israel. Students are
urged to assist Boris by writing to
Dr. O w e n and to their local M P s ,
urging them to take up his case. A
list of M P s is available at I C
U n i o n Office.
Western protests have in the
past resulted in the release of
Soviet Jews. Boris's fate n o w
depends on sufficient pressure
being exerted on his behalf.

Eleven year old Jerome C a n v i n
and six of his friends from the
Honniton Primary School Deaf
Unit attended a special party in
college last Sunday. T h e event
was organised by R C S U in order
to present Jerome with a special
" P h o n i c E a r . "

£'800 raised by a special R C S rag
collection - over a one-quarter of
which was raised by Zosia
Zbrzezniak alone. Zosia made the
presentation personally.
A teacher from the unit

qualities of the aid, which allows
communication with the children
at up lo half a mile, via a radio
system.
Jerome's family joined in the
celebration a n d expressed their
sincere gratitude to all of those
who had helped in any way. Party

mountain of food. After the
children had left, the exhausted
students only just mustered the
strength to down a barrel of beer,
one of their well-earned rewards.
The event was covered by the
national press.

and Union President Mary Attenborough will be student representative
on College's Overseas Students' Committee.
Council passed a vote of thanks to Sheyne Lucock for all the work he
has done for the Union.
Publicity
The Meeting made several small changes to Union publicity rules.
Clubs and Societies will no longer need to ask permission to put up
posters but individuals will still be required to do so. Only the Union
Publicity Officer will be able to grant permission. No dayglo posters of
any colour will be permitted. All election posters will have to show the
date of the relevant election.
Recognising that the Constituent College Unions regularly use A1
(48" x 32") size posters, previously illegal under Union rules, Council
amended the rules to allow posters up to A1 size.
In a discussion on publicity for Union Meetings and the distribution of
"Executive News" it was suggested that it could be distributed as a
supplement to FELIX as well as separately before and during a U G M .
This w'.i be tried to see if it is feasible.
Following criticism of Mary Attenborough's active support for Sheyne
Lucock's presidential campaign, a suggestion was made that sabbatical
Union officers should not be allowed to campaign on behalf of any
election candidate. However Council decided not to discuss this.
W U S Collection
Council agreed to support the new World University Service
scholarship to enable a "third world" student to take a one year
advanced course at IC. The WUScollection to betaken at the beginning
of the session during registration will now be devoted specifically to that
purpose.

A meeting of the Athletics
Grounds Committee discussed
means of enabling students to
meet socially at Harlington after
matches. A subcommittee of the
Athletics Clubs Committee is to
discuss several possibilities of
arranging late coaches back to
College or a shuttle service to
Hatton Cross tube station, to
a l l o w students to stay at
H a r l i n g t o n after the m a i n
coaches leave at 6.00 p.m.
O V E R S E A S S T U D E N T S
Q U O T A
T h e U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s
Committee has told College that
it must reduce the number of its
overseas students by 7 per cent in
1981-82.
IC's Governing Body rejected a
proposal by L o r d A n n a n , V i c e
Chancellor of L o n d o n University,
that Colleges should get round the
quota by charging the full
economic cost on some courses.
Governing Body agreed with
M a r y Attenborough that the
concept of full economic cost was
unrealistic. She pointed out that
the imposition of quotas was
abhorrent to academic freedom.
Government policy on overseas
students was not properly thought
out and they had ignored the
benefits to this country of
educating overseas students.
She told Governing Body that
College should not be complacent
about quotas thinking that
overseas student numbers would
fall anyway because of high fees.
Protests should be made about the
principle.
Governing Body C h a i r m a n
Henry Fisher said he would
communicate the Governors'
opposition but take no further
action.
C H E A P F U R N I T U R E
F O R L I N S T E A D
T h e U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s
Committee has allocated only
£35,000 to furnish the new
Linstead H a l l extension. A
working party has found that
even using the cheapest furniture
available more money will be
needed. A Governing Body
working party is to consider how
more money can be found.
N E W U N I O N C A R D
I C U Honorary Secretary is
designing next session's U n i o n
C a r d a n d is l o o k i n g for
suggestions for its improvement.
He has already agreed to include
t h e ' p h o n e n u m b e r s o f
" N i g h t l i n e " a n d "Release" on
the back of the card.
U G M I N Q U O R A C Y
Publicity for U n i o n Meetings
has been better than last year but
t h e r e is s t i l l r o o m 1 o r
improvement, according to a
paper on inquoracy at U G M s
p r e p a r e d b y t h e U n i o n
Permanent W o r k i n g Party.
The P W P has suggested
improved poster design and wider
advertisement on all U n i o n
media. They have also proposed
setting up an I C U stall at
Freshers' Fair and a shorter, more
readable, Freshers' G u i d e to
U G M s . There could be a
permanent display of information
on the U n i o n in the Lower
L o u n g e . T o ensure U n i o n
Officers b e c o m e k n o w n to
students the Council photograph
should be produced early in the
A u t u m n term.
T h e P W P also suggested that
U n i o n M e e t i n g s s h o u l d
automatically be adjourned at
2.25 p m and that Executive
reports should not include any
proposals.
