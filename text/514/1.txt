TOTAL BOYCOTT!
Students Urged to Eat Elsewhere Next Term
The Union is mounting a continuous boycott of all College
student refectories f r o m the start of next term.
This drastic action is a Union Meeting's response to the
latest 4 per cent price rise and the certainty of large monthly
price increases to follow.
A n Emergency U n i o n Meeting to be held on the first
T h u r s d a y next t e r m will also consider a proposal to withdraw
Union cooperation f r o m College's " M e e t - I C " day.
T h e U n i o n Executive has made no firm plans for the provision of
alternative food but was waiting to see the response to yesterday's
boycott. They are urging all students to arrange to eat outside College
or bring sandwiches. Lists of restaurants near College will be available.
Faced with the prospect of a 10 College might have done better
per cent refectory price rise in 5 to close these as well, for very few-
months and the constant refusal of
College to consider the Union's
views, the U n i o n M e e t i n g
decided that an all-out boycott
was the only way left to force
College to listen to the students.
T h e success of the action now
depends on all students observing
the boycott.
T h e " M e e t I C " day, to be held
on 2nd M a y , is being organised by
College to improve . relations
between College and the local
community. About 300 local
residents will be invited to see the
College and several U n i o n
Societies have been asked to
provide exhibits. There will also
be a social meeting between the
visitors and stall'and students.

the U n i o n Meeting decides not to

activists believe that College
would be very annoyed by
student noncooperation.

said that only 12 people had got
past him at one door of the
refectory. K i r s l e n Pratt picketing
at the main Consort Gallery
entrance said that most people
had been turned away.
T h e one-day boycott has been a
great success, exceeding ail but
the most optimistic predictions
and there now is every indication
that next term's continuous
boycott will be successful.

C O U N C I L R E P O R T
The Union is asking College to buy more houses for student
accommodation and to set up head tenancy schemes.
IC Union Council, meeting on Monday, heard that the University
Grants Committee is unable to give College any more money for
accommodation. The meeting passed a motion asking College to use
any money available for investment to purchase the freehold or
leasehold of houses and suggested that College could use Housing
Corporation finance to build or convert property through a Housing
Association.
College is considering taking up a head tenancy in property in
Lexham Gardens. Council empowered the Union Executive to enter
such a scheme on the Union's behalf if College cannot be persuaded to
go ahead.
