Elk s Epistle (6)
W e l l the end of term has
arrived at last and everybody's
packing up and going home to see
M u m , leaving everybody in the
U n i o n Office free to carry out
their most obscure fantasies, apart
from me that is - 1 have no
fantasies; I carry out all mine in
real life immediately. W e l l when
you all get home be sure to give
my love to your M u m s and Dads
and kid brothers and think of me
on Easter Sunday eating creme
eggs underneath the duplicator.
S o c i a l C o l o u r s
W e l l today's the last day for
handing-in your nominations for
social colours - so if you've been
t h i n k i n g o f n o m i n a t i n g
somebody; you'd better shift your
arse before 5:30 today.

If you live in college-owned or
college-run residence then your
property is insured in your room
over the holidays as it is during
term. Y o u r stuff is also insured in
j transit between home and college.
P a r k i n g p e r m i t s
If you were issued with a
parking permit at the beginning
of the year and have since sold
your car or no longer use it for
coming into college, could you
please let me know so it can be
reallocated to someone who needs
it.
E l e c t i o n s
The results of the elections at
the U G M on Thursday 15th
were:
Academic Affairs Officer - W y n
Jenkins, External Affairs Officer -
J o h n Passmore, U G M C h a i r m a n
- M i c k Berry, R a g C h a i r m a n -
Rachel Snee, Sexual Affairs
Officer - M e l K i n k i e .
I think the fifth person in the list
will do a particularly good job,
just the hermaphrodite for the
job.
R e f e c t o r i e s
Don't forget, as things stand
we've got a constant boycott from
the beginning of next term so feed
yourself up over Easter. A n y b o d y
who eats in Mooney's next term
will have to face my chopper!
W e l l folks, see you all next
term; bring some wellies and some
sheep back for me!

WELFARE ARTICLE
Supplementary Benefit
In last week's article on
supplementary benefit there was
an e r r o r . T h e rate for a
'Householder' is £15.55 per week,
and not £12.45 per week. A
householder is someone who is
responsible for the outgoings
incurred in his accommodation
e.g. heating, lighting ortelephone
bills. If you are a 'householder'
and claiming for.rent over the
vacation, you could get £15.55
plusyourrent less £13.90 vacation
element. Bearing in mind that the
non-householder rate is £12.45
per w e e k , it w o u l d s e e m
worthwhile to press the D.H.S.S.
to accept you as a householder. It
is complicated, however, by the
fact that there is no official
definition of a householder so it is
a question of arguing it out. With
the D . H . S . S . o f f i c i a l w h o
interviews you.
Free Dental Treatment
If you are under 21, you can get
free dental treatment on the
N H S . anyway. If you are over 21,
then you will have to pay up to £5
for each course of treatment -
assuming that you don't require
anything more than fillings and/or
extractions.
There is an exception, however,
in the case of people on very low
incomes.
To get free treatment, your net
income after deduction of rent
and travel costs should not be
much more than £18 per week.
During term times, very few
students would qualify for this,
but during the short vacations,
your gross income is only the
vacation element - i.e. £13.90 per
week.
So, it might be worthwhile to
see if you can get any necessary
dental treatment done during the
vacation and then ask your dentist
for a declaration to sign and then
you shouldn't have to pay. If
you're over 21, then, this could
well save you a fiver.
