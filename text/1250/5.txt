Nightbus Needs You...
I would like to bring to the atten-
tion of all students that the union
provides a minibus service to take
people home from the union on
Wednesday and Friday nights. The
service is there to enable students
to get home from the union safely
who otherwise couldn't, for exam-
ple women by themselves.
It is currently rumoured that the
union would like to stop the serv-
ice running as a way of cutting
costs. This is a prime example of
our union putting penny-pinching
before the safety of students -
what would the union do if a stu-
dent was attacked on their way
home when they would have been
safely dropped at their door by the
minibus. In order to make the
withdrawal of the service less
obvious there has been little or no
advertisement of its existence
after the first couple of weeks of
term, when a drive to recruit new
staff for the service failed.
The service at present is being run
by a small number of committed
students, and we are always look-
ing for more people to help. If you
are interested in helping please
contact Richard Winkle
(richard.winkle@ic.ac.uk) for
more details.

personally i do believe we landed
on the moon but if your gonna
write about the dam subject at
least include the important argue-
ments, or couldn't you think of a
reason of why the stars and
stripes flag is rippling inthe wind
when the moon has no atmos-
phere, or was it just starched that
way for effect?

Dear Felix,
Following the science column
'We did go to the moon - honest'
(well I never!), I thought I should
tell you that the NASA did actual-
ly bother to publish a report con-
tradicting the various "conspiracy
theories".
Also, a related anecdote: the
leading proponent of the "hoax"
theory, filmmaker Bart Sibrel, con-
fronted Mr Buzz Aldrin, 72, at a
hotel in Beverly Hills. When he
demanded that the astronaut
swear on a Bible that he had
walked on the moon, Mr Aldrin
opted to punch Mr Sibrel in the
face.
Made my day!
Editorial BitchSlap
Dear Will,
While your editorial probably
wasn't aimed at me, the point
about "vocational" degrees is that
they purport to be vocational
when they are not. Take a (hope-
fully) hypothetical degree in fruit
picking. Will it ensure you get a
job picking fruit? No. Fruit pickers
already provide on the job train-
ing, they will not have had signifi-
cant input into the degree course,
and they will probably be looking
for people to meet physical rather
than academic requirements.
Similarly, UK universities now
churn out so many people with
media studies degrees that there
is no correlation at all between
obtaining such a degree and get-
ting a job in the media, or even a
job at all. On the other hand you
do acquire around £20,000 of
debt. Yet the government per-
suades people to take up such
degrees on the basis that you will
get a better job, and earn more
money.
The government should certain-
ly not be subsidising such
degrees, not because it's a waste
of public money but because it's a
waste of the private money that
the main victims of this "egalitari-
an" fraud pay. This is not intellec-
tual fascism, physics and other
such courses at universities like IC
are truly vocational: At IC you are
not so much taught about physics,
you are taught to be a physicist.
The value of the degree to
employers (either the government
or the city) is not your ability to
real off streams of equations, but
your ability to solve mathematical
and physical problems. A non lab-
based physics course would be as
big a fraud as the media study for
precisely the same reasons.
What the government most cer-
tainly should subsidise are real
vocational qualifications (like
apprenticeships) in partnership
with businesses. The students on
such courses would have a far
more valuable qualification at the
end, they would be more employ-
able and as they are earning while
learning they won't be saddled
with £20K of debt.

Good points, well made. Thanks.
Students In Diapers
Dear Felix
We raised a lot of money for our
Charity Week and had lots of fun
doing this as mentioned in Beci's
article issue no. 1249 Wye sup
The students at Wye Campus
showed their true colours and
dressed up in baby ware for our
kids tea party for Children in Need
and raised £211.17
I would like to thank all the stu-
dents who entered into the spirit
of things and gave generously to a
worthwhile cause.
Yours

VAT No More
Dear Felix,
I have some good news for non-
taught PG students, they can now
use the catering facilities in the
SCR VAT free and I've tried it out
myself. As long as you present
your IC swipe card at the till your
VAT should be automatically
deducted from your bill along with
the 10% IC discount.
After writing to Felix a few
weeks ago about PG students not
being able to get VAT relief in the
SCR, I received a response from
catering manager Edward Lilley.
He apparently knew nothing about
it, but I'd like to thank him for
speedily resolving this with some
till reprogramming. I would also
like to say that I was a bit disap-
pointed that the union president
did not see fit to respond to my
query about how to rectify what
was essentially a student issue,
especially when I got such a help-
ful and positive assistance from
the Rector's office.
I'm also wondering if IC catering
might want consider donating the
VAT overcharged since
August/September to charity, I'm
sure that the Children in Need
appeal is still running.

Damovo-no-no
Dear Felix,
After having paid for '24 hour,
un-metered Internet access from
Student Connect, I have a slight
complaint - I don't have it, and I
was wondering if others were suf-
fering the same problem. Let me
recount a little tale...
The first week at Imperial, after
signing up, the speeds and relia-
bility were exceptional - I was get-
ting more than my money's worth.
A couple of weeks after that, as
more people signed up and start-
ing the service, predictably the
speeds decreased, but were per-
fectly acceptable.
Now: speeds a slug on Prozac
would be ashamed of and a serv-
ice as reliable as British Rail.
When we do have a connection, it
is almost entirely unusable.
After contacting Damovo a few
times the response seems to be
the same; hardware problem, the
engineers are working on it, no
idea when it'll be fixed, maybe lots
of people are using the net, please
don't stop paying us.
This isn't just a isolated case
either, this is affecting at least all
the rest of us here at Fisher Hall,
possibly the rest of Evelyn
Gardens and from what I have
gleaned from the IC Grape Vine
other halls and residences as well.
I find it slightly shameful that
the company Imperial College of
Science, Technology and Medicine
uses for student net access can't
even let me check my mail. I
would welcome a response from
Damovo, as long as it didn't go
along the lines of the above!

Damovo are aware of the situa-
tion, and have assured me it's a
temporoary problem. They are
also starting a feedback forum in
