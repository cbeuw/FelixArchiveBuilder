^TOums & Singles,
3/5
The band from Iceland, who sing in
their own personal language, are
back with a new album. In the vein
of so many bands (Radiohead) it
seems that they are trying to be
slightly more experimental with
their music in each progressive
album, and I'm concerned that they
may already have reached their
peak with the previous one. This
album has therefore succeeded in
leaving the listener with some
mind-blowing tracks, and some
that seem fit to be from the sound-
track of the latest M Night
Shyamalan movie.
The ethereal wailings of the lead
singer are still very much at the
forefront of the musical style, and
the low-keyboards and moaning
(violin bowed) guitars still provide
you with the atmospheric qualities
that you have come to expect from
this band, but somehow it all
sounds very much like they're doing
all this because they feel they have
to do something 'different'. Perhaps
they really are on a spiritual journey,
but given the choice of listening to
this or 'Agaetis Byrjun', I'm afraid it
would be the latter every time.
Having said all this, it is still a
stunning collection of songs that
give you the feeling that you have
left planet earth, and have at least
made a pit stop on the outer rims of
the solar system, where comets
freeze to the sound of heavily dis-
torted guitars, and planets quake
with full orchestral swell.
If you liked the last album, you
will probably enjoy this one, and I
would advise you that it is worth
the price for several of the songs
alone. If you haven't heard these
guys before, go out and get 'Agaetis
Byrjun', and then, if you like them,
go back out and get ( ). But, even
after listening to it four or five times,
it hasn't got the raw surrealism and
bewitching mood that grabbed me
when I first heard 'Svefn-G-Englar',
and I'm concerned that while this is
a great album to listen to when
'relaxing', these guys may already
be on the way back down from
what must have been a fantastic
trip. Will
David Bowie
The Best Of
4/5
With an astounding career span-
ning four decades, how anyone
can claim to put 'the best of David
Bowie' all on one double album is
beyond me, however this would
be my only criticism of this excel-
lent compilation.
With a little something for
everyone, the two CDs soar
through his 25 or so albums with
ease, combining classic Bowie (if
one could coin such a phrase from
a man of so many faces and
sounds) such as 'Space Oddity'
and 'Life on Mars' with some of
the best collaborations around,
like 'Under Pressure' with Queen,
and 'Dancing in The Street' with
Mick Jagger to name but two.
(Will and Gareth, you could stand
to learn a thing or two here).
Highlights for me personally
include 'Starman', 'John I'm Only
Dancing' (a lesser known gem)
and 'Absolute Beginners', the
beauty of this compilation is that
everyone can and will have their
own favourites.
All tracks are digitally remas-
tered, and although I'm not sure
Ziggy Stardust will ever be the
same without that good old LP
crackle, the chronological move
through the albums is smoother
with all tracks being of a similar
sound quality.
There are few surprises here but
also no notable absences, so for
diehard Bowie fans, whilst there
will be little new here for you, it is
a good collection to own, and real-
ly takes you through the highlights
of his whole career. Although ini-
tially sceptical about what a re-
hash of every hit put together
could gain, especially after a num-
ber of 'Best of and Singles
Collections have already been
released, this album really is
something special. For those new
to the phenomena that is David
Bowie (if such a concept is possi-
ble), curious, or never really had
the opportunity to experience his
music, this album really is a good
place to start. Katy
Singles
vega4 - Drifting Away
Violently EP
This strange mix of a band
(apparently all 4 members
come from various far flung
reaches of the Commonwealth)
are one of the latest signings to
Taste Media (famous for being
the home of Muse). This EP
contains four tracks that made
me feel chuffed that there may
actually be an alternative to ali
the pop rubbish in the charts
these days.
Most of you reading this will
remember how massive
Radiohead were in 1997 and
when the Verve's 'Urban
Hymns' was top of the charts.
This album takes elements of
these styles and moulds it into
something of their own. vega4
have taken the pace of
Radiohead's guitar riffs and
dropped the depression and
teenage angst from the lyrics.
They've replaced this with
euphoric, anthemic lyrics and
| a somewhat cheerier approach
to the whole music-writing
thing. The title track is a bit
livelier than the other tracks,
which are more along the lines
of modern day ballads sung
with a bit of welly.
Also being compared to Led
Zep and Fugazi at this embry-
onic stage in their career, this
band has lots of potential and
we will probably see them go
down the road of proving
themselves to be enigmatic
performers with real vigour.
The single 'Drifting Away
Violently' is out on 9th
December and they'll be tour-
ing the UK at the start of that
month. The intensity of this
band's music jumps out at you
when you have your first listen
to their songs and I would def-
initely recommend all those
dispossessed indie-rock kids
out there to get a load of this
and restore your faith in the
music industry.
