Hello there my innocent little ones. This week's theme for your education and enlightenment is Evilness and it comes in as many fantastic
flavours as my big bag of sweets. First we've got a book about a true master of nastiness - American Psycho. / know this was written when
some of you were mere babies and you've all seen the film, but frankly the film made me laugh. The book is much more dark and disturbing
and deserves to be read.
If you fancy a bit of DIY evil then we've also got a review of I was a Teenage Dominatrix with practical hints and tips for paying your way through
college. Don't say I don't do anything for you. Interestingly, it was much easier to get someone to review this book than any other. Maybe you'll
see a theme appearing in the future.... Roz

BRET
EASTON
ELLIS
Sickeningly compelling from
start to finish, Bret Easton Ellis'
most famous and most lauded
novel is one of those reads that
can not be forgotten easily; our
world is shown to us through the
mind of Patrick Bateman - a
world of big money, misogyny
and casual murder.
Patrick Bateman is young,
American Psycho
Bret Easton Ellis
handsome and has a successful
job on Wall Street. He is also a
self-confessed psychopath. In
Patrick Bateman's mind, style
and substance are one and the
same. His vulture's gaze picks
out designer cuff-links, exclusive
restaurants, the newest must-
have electronic gadgets and, of
course, "hardbodies". The
threads of Ellis' prose weave in
all of these things and, before
long, you are woven in too - an
accomplice, a voyeur.
The real genius of Ellis lies in
his ability to create characters
that can be totally believable
despite them living at the
extremes of human existence:
compassionless, vain and empty
- there is little for the reader to
find sympathetic in Bateman.
But Bateman's insecurities about
his status and his looks make
him a tangible human being,
almost understandable - we
aren't even consoled by the
thought that he is anything less
than human. But don't trust
what Bateman says too much.
Everything he tells the reader
teeters on the edge of reality: the
video-nasty murders, the action
movie escape from the police.
Remember: this is his story and
this is his mind.
As murder follows murder, and
brutality and viciousness builds,
Ellis never lets the reader leave
the table; whenever you feel that
you have had enough, the deli-
ciousness of Ellis' deathly dark
humour convinces you to take
just one more bite - and then
another and another. Then, when
he has made you comfortable
again, with Titus-like pleasure
Ellis reminds you exactly what it
is you are eating.
And so, as Bateman eviscer-
ates and decapitates, we come
to realise: there is no escape.

I was a Teenage Dominatrix
S h a w n a Kenney
I don't know about you, but ver-
bally abusing nappy-wearing
men whilst forcing them to do
the hoovering constitutes a fairly
typical Friday night. Okay, I do
exaggerate slightly (often my
boyfriends drew the line at
housework) but my point is that
while 'dominatrix' may not be
the most common entry on
someone's CV, I'm not sure that,
in this case, it necessarily merits
an entire book to be dedicated to
it. Maybe I'm just bitter because
Shawna Kenney made a living
from being a mouthy, moody,
bitch whereas I do it for nothing.
Still, I'm not convinced.
Beginning with the obligatory
'I was happy despite being a
poor/ugly/fat/tom-boyish child',
the introduction to / Was a
Teenage Dominatrix describes
how, too poor to have lessons,
Shawna decides to learn how to
swim by throwing herself in the
deep end. Fortunately for the lit-
erary world, Shawna doesn't
drown but I think the lack of oxy-
gen to her head for the few sec-
onds she was submerged
explains a lot. Starting college,
Shawna searches for a decently
paid job. A brief and unsuccess-
ful flirtation with exotic dancing
precedes a party where she
realises her dom tendencies. The
rest of the book meanders its
way through the underground
world of the sex industry, with
Shawna, under her new guise of
Mistress Alexis, recounting tales
of interesting punters, bizarre
requests and the obligatory
spilling of a disturbing variety of
body fluids.
Despite its interesting subject,
/ Was a Teenage Dominatrix (like
our neighbourhood postman)
simply fails to deliver. Pitched
someone between Sweet Valley
High and Topsy and Tim Go
Whoring, Kenney tries to be con-
troversial and shocking but sim-
ply comes across schmaltzy and
banal. Indeed, it shows a certain
amount of skill to produce such
an uninspiring book from such
potentially juicy subject matter.
The fact that the book was
voted 'most likely to be banned'
by independent publishers in the
US unfortunately appears to say
more about the conservatism of
the States rather than the nature
of the book. Still, it makes a
mildly amusing read, the kind of
thing you want when you're des-
perately trying to put off an
assignment. Personally, I'd put
the Â£5.99 towards a new PVC
dog leash; you never know when
it'll come in handy.
