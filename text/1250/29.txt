IC V 8 - 0 Kings V
It was a game of two halves. In
the first half we scored 3, and in
the second we scored 5. However,
the scoreline only tells half the
story of the latest chapter in the
epic rivalry between IC and Kings.
From the off, it was backs to the
wall stuff - for obvious reasons, as
we were playing Kings.
We set our stall out early on giv-
ing 110% knowing the final score
would affect the result. The break-
through came from Phil, on his
debut for the fifths, with a majes-
tic lob over the flailing keeper. The
second came after great work from
Sprout, a Dowbor-type step-over
from Hideki and a cool finish from
Gucci. Kings heads didn't drop
though and they keep plugging
away. But with Dave "The
Lawnmower" Yates covering every
blade of grass on the pitch the
killer blow came on the stroke of
half-time from Hideki after confu-
sion in the box. The fourth came
soon after half-time from Gucci
and it was curtains for Kings. IC
were rampant and put them to the
sword. Phil completed his hat-
trick and two goals from Leon,
after a masterful tactical substitu-
tion from the captain, completed
the rout. It would have been more
but Sprout couldn't hit a cows arse
with a banjo. Captain Caruso was
thrilled with the result but quickly
put the teams feet back on the
ground, told us not to get carried
away and take each game as it
comes, "Seriously lads, big game
Wednesday..."

IC III 5 - 0 Southbank II
After having lost to Essex in the pre-
vious match the game against
Southbank seconds was a must-win
game for us to remain in the top
three of the BUSA league. The start
was fairly intimidating with the
opposition having some rather skill-
ful players showing good technique
who were able to get some good
passing together looking quite dan-
gerous. Then James O'Prey thread-
ed a through ball to Alex De Luca
who made a run down the left to
score making up for missing a simi-
lar chance just minutes before.
The fight back was immediate
with their captain hitting the bar
with a shot from outside the area
and a wonderful save from Tom
Clifton who was able to get down to
save another chance. But we always
looked threatening, getting some
good moves along the wings but
unfortunately not following through.
Then we got another goal with a
good run from Dominic down the
right who centred the ball to Alex
who then finished it to make it two.
They were starting to lose control
and we didn't have to wait long for
a third goal with a pass from Alex
"Gabba" Edwards to Simone whose
close range shot was parried by the
keeper back off him into the net. In
the second half they came out look-
ing stronger and better organised
but our back three held firm and
they started to show their frustration
with one of the players kicking the
ball away several times. The game
was killed off when Dan deep in our
half, passed down the left for Alex to
run onto and cross to Simone who
fired past the keeper. After this they
tried a retaliation but everything that
was able to get past midfield and
the defence was blocked by Tom.
The icing was put on after Gabba
squared it unselfishly to Phil to give
us a resounding 5-0 victory and a
good chance of qualifying for the
BUSA Vase.
