Virgins Score Twice
Ladies Rugby
IC Virgins 10 - 5 RHUL
The Virgin's winning streak contin-
ues with an outstanding victory
over Royal Holloway on Sunday.
A strong start saw the Virgin's
camped in their 22 for the majori-
ty of the first half. With uncontest-
ed scrums - at their request -
Lumpy took the ball off the back
and ran blind again and again,
gaining ground each time. She was
really on form, biffing her way
through player after player, per-
forming a delicate pirouette before
slamming the ball over the line for
our first try. This was quickly fol-
lowed by Aiofe who was playing
out of position at fly half -doing a
blinding job too - broke through
the line, side stepped the full back,
sprinted three quarters of the
length of the field and scored
under the posts.
The fought back hard, and we
defended our five yard line for half
an hour before they finally scored.
Despite Lumpy's attempts at drop
goals there were sadly no conver-
sions.
Spatch's family came to spec-
tate in the unrelenting rain, but
Mother Spatch was more enter-
tained by her 'chunky legs' than in
the rugby itself. The virgin's look
forward to Wednesday and indeed
the next three columns.
Ladies Rugby
RHUL 5 - 0 IC Virgins
We all undertook the mammoth
trek out to Egham - which does-
n't even have an 020 area code
- for the rematch, this time in
the BUSA league, with the
Virgins knowing they would
leapfrog the country bumpkins in
the league were they to win...
the stakes were high indeed.
It wouldn't be a proper match
report without the standard non
rugby announcements. The most
important thing is that we have
our very first virgin engage-
ment... lush Snotty-Posh will be
sporting a sparkling ring and will
show it to all who ask. We also
have to say goodbye to an old
girl, Minor, who has been play-
ing for us for about 5 years - no-
one can remember exactly how
long - and now she's off around
the world on her electives, and
this represents major loss to the
team.
Anyway, on with the match.
Having played with uncontested
scrums on Saturday we made
sure that this wouldn't be the
case for the return trip as the full
power of our forwards wanted to
be unleashed. However after
injuring their hooker in the first
five minutes the ref decided that
for safety's sake the opposition
A few of the many Virgins in the Union that fateful night
Thank them for all the songs they were singing...
would again be allowed to play
like girls.
The game was a very scrappy
affair, mainly due the fact that
the ref insisted on blowing up for
every minor infringement that
might have inconvenienced the
opposition. Not that we're bit-
ter.... After about twenty minutes
play they managed to come off a
five yard scrum and power the
ball over the line - although there
was gallant defending we, for
once, weren't quick enough.
Fair enough, we thought, plen-
ty of time to get it back, especial-
ly with us dominating the lush
running play, when it happened.
This was not to be the case, how-
ever, as the ref blew up for half
time after a mere half an hour:
we weren't aware that this had
been arranged, but that was pri-
marily because it hadn't. Our lush
rugby skills - rucking, mauling,
tackling, running, the lot - were
rightly praised in the refreshing
half time team, and we were
back on the pitch raring to go.
The second half was pretty
much the same as the first, with
some storming runs, especially
from our lush full back Ash. The
backs supported each other well,
and if our handling had been as
good as our running we would
have one by a mile - sorry for-
wards.
We were camped on their 22
for some time, but the uncon-
tested scrums meant that their
full back had more than enough
time to clear the lines after
scrums so we had to keep re-tak-
ing the same ground. Ash went
off injured but came back on the
play with a limp. Bendy was car-
ried off - i knew that it was only
a matter of time before she got
injured. Credit has to go to
Baggy for putting in a proper low
tackle on their only Heifer. In
uncontested scrums - have i
whinged enough yet? - our front
row especially mutts couldn't
really strut their stuff but had a
great game in the loose. Forward
of the match had to be Jenny, for
running off with the ball, for-
wards, whenever she got it. Back
of the match goes to Aoife for
her storming runs down the
field. Bad luck to the Virgins for
losing a game that they general-
ly wouldn't have done, but hope-
fully we'll get the points on a
technicality.
Oh yes, i have to mention the
stunning support from the
injured 'sometimes i don't recog-
nise myself in the mirror' Dapps.
Ash is lush, and for once the
lovely Pinky doesn't get a men-
tion - oops - and finally it should
be noted that Minor just chun-
dered and Dan fell over in it.
