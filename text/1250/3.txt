And Alex Said...
You have to wonder about the
quality of TV programmes these
days. Looking at the channels on
satellite or cable, it seems you
can set up your own TV station
for about fifty pence. With a few
out-of-work actors, I gave it a go.
Here's what's on today, peppered
with adverts for Ocean Finance:
11.00am Teleshopping
Could you possibly live without a
device for steam-cleaning your
pet rodent? Do you dream that
one day you'll own a telescopic
whisky bottle holder? Do you
yearn for something to take the
stress out of opening packets of
crisps? If the answer to any of
these questions is "no", you must
be completely mad - in which
case, you'll definitely want to
check out our Sensomatic -
Guaranteed To Make You Sane
Within 21 Days!® And if you're
not completely satisfied, you
probably just forgot why the hell
you bought it in the first place -
so we'll also send you, absolutely
free, our Boost Your Memory Kit,
consisting of notepad and pencil!

comprehensive school that deals
with the issues relevant to most
children today. In this episode,
Chubby and Fat Wanker get
TV!
4.30pm Little Silly Denzil
Surreal children's programme
made in 1967. Supposedly the
creators of this programme were
high on drugs throughout making
it, although today they deny all
memory of ever working on the
show. In this episode, Little Silly
Denzil takes his dog Canine
Abyss to see Dee I'Air about his
problems growing the crop Cow
caught by Mrs Dappy having anal
sex in the playground, Kris has
her head blown off by a rocket,
and Pete gets kneecapped.
5.30pm You've Been Maimed!
Hilarious family video camera
footage of all those home acci-
dents! Quite why Shirley from
Basildon was filming her hus-
band using the chain saw to trim
the hedge, we'll never know, but
at least the family will always be
able to remember what he used
to look like, and the side-splitting
consequences of that slippery
dog poo!

Special version of the holiday
programme where viewers tell
presenters where to go. In this
episode, presenter Jamie
Theakston visits a minefield in
Afghanistan.
