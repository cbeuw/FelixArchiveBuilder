Infernal Contraption
In a secluded workshop, deep in the
bowels of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering, the elements of earth,
fire, metal and gaffa tape were
brought together by four ordinary
men. Two of their number were stu-
dents, named Jonathan Pillai and
Gary Ewer, and the other two, tech-
nicians of that department, named
Phil Jones and Ray Thompson.
Among them, they created the
Infernal Contraption, a fighting robot
akin to those that, as legend would
have it, appear on flickering boxes
across the land of a Friday even.
This strange machine, fashioned
from steel and sewerage pipe
(unused), boasted two large wheels,
and a vertical spinning disk mount-
ed on a sub frame so as to swing
back and fourth as would a hammer
in the hand of Thor.
The first outward venture of the
Infernal Contraption took place in
August 2001, when, only half fin-
ished, it was taken to Wembley
Arena for the qualifying of Robot
Wars series 5. Unfortunately, due to
its being overweight, it was not
allowed to take part in the series.
Over the months following this
denial, bits were cut off, and in
some cases welded back on to the
IC. New fixtures were fashioned and
fitted, then changed a bit and
until in late May, we heard rumours
that qualifying for series 6 was to be
held in early July. With this in mind,
we upped the workrate just in case.
It was a good job we did, because in
early June we received confirmation
that we were due to attend qualify-
ing at 09:30 on July 4th.
As qualifying drew closer, we
seemed in pretty good shape. A
couple of days beforehand, we had
the IC driving around nicely. On the
day before, we got aggressive and
smashed up a bin and an old filing
cabinet - we thought they were
looking at us funny. We also found
that, as expected, spinning the IC
on the spot with the disk up to full
speed caused one wheel to lift up in
the air (by virtue of the magical
gyroscopic effect). After one final
practice, we put the IC in the back
of Ray's car, and set off.
Following an overnight stop, we
arrived at a disused military base at
Newton, near Nottingham, and
waited to be checked in. First came
the weigh-in. Horror of horrors, the
(rather suspect) scales read 105
Kg, 5 Kg over the limit. Fortunately,
by putting the robot on the scales
the other way round - see what we
did there? - we were able to make it
weigh 91 Kg. That's a good trick for
any of you on diets at the moment.
After getting through the weigh-in
and various tech checks, we set up
on our bench and then waited for
our turn to slash and burn. The for-
mat was a series of 4-way melees
with the winner going through to the
TV show. The robots we were up
against were called Double Trouble,
a box shape with two small spin-
ning disks, GBH II, a racing car
shape with double flipper, and some
dodgy looking thing that had a
name like Ripper.
The time came for our melee. We
made our way up into the control
pods and drove the IC out into the
arena. Ripper never made it out of
the holding pen, and so there were
three. The battle began. We got a
good hit on Double Trouble quite
early on, which pierced their armour
and damaged their transmission on
one side. GBH II had intermittent
radio problems, so we hit them a
few times, but didn't want to do
them too much damage while they
were immobile. Part of our polycar-
bonate armour split due to being
cold formed into a curve, but lucki-
ly, no one got in to do any damage.
By the end of it all, Double Trouble's
disks had both come off, GBH II had
a few gashes, but was otherwise
fine, and we were still working, but
with superficial damage.
We came back down from the
control pods, deactivated the robot,
and waited for the decision. We
were all well pleased when Bill
Hobbins, the producer, told us that
it was a good fight, so all three
robots would be appearing on TV.
We were due back in three days, so
had the weekend to sort out our
armour.
Over the weekend, we replaced
the polycarbonate armour with thick
polyethylene sewage pipe, generally
tightened things up, and had a bit
more driving practice. On Sunday
evening, we set off for Lincoln, and
a good night's sleep.
We left the robot charging up
overnight. In the morning, we took it
off charge and decided it was a
good idea to do a quick test. This
played right into the hands of the
evil stray screw hiding in one of our
speed controllers, which promptly
expired, causing one wheel to stop
working. The only thing we could do
was pack up, leave and sort it out
when we got to the filming at
Newton.
Just as before, the first thing after
our arrival was the weigh-in. The
scales said 105 Kg, but this time
they were proper scales, so 105 Kg
meant 105 Kg. Houston, we had a
problem! Fortunately, we half
expected to be a bit over, and had
planned to remove one of the two
weapon drive motors if we needed
to. I went and scrounged a new
speed controller while Ray and Gary
removed the motor,.
We got through the weigh-in, set
up on our bench, and set about
changing the speed controller. With
an hour or so of good teamwork, we
had the IC back together and ready
to test... and would you believe it, it
worked just fine.
After a free lunch and more
standing around, it was nearly our
turn to fight. We did a brief pre-fight
interview with Phillippa Forester,
then queued up to go into the arena
along with the other three robots we
were up against.
Then came our turn to go up into
the control pods, above a live audi-
ence and a noisy arena complete
with hazards aplenty and baying
house robots.
If you want to find out what hap-
pened after that, then why not
watch BBC2, Friday 6th December,
18:45.
Also, look out for the Infernal
Contraption in Robot Wars Extreme:
University Challenge, due to air
some time next year.
