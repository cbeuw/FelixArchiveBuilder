The Vines
Shepherd's Bush Empire, November 2nd
3/5
It's Sunday night, the place is
packed and I'm feeling a little old.
It seems the majority of The
Vines' fans really shouldn't be out
this late, especially before a
school night. Which is a shame -
the band's appeal shouldn't be
limited to angst-ridden teenagers.
When they get it right, The Vines
are a great live act. But before
getting to them, there's the small
matter of two support acts...
First are The Bandits; six
Scousers doing a passable
impression of The Coral, blended
with the Mersey beatpop of The
La's. The Bandits run a club night
that showcases upcoming local
talent. Appropriately called the
Bandwagon, it typifies the glut of
sound-alike bands in Liverpool at
the moment, and The Bandits are
no exception. Tonight they fail to
inspire, lacking the originality of
their psychedelic compadres.
Next up: the riff-driven indie
rock of Nada Surf, New York vet-
erans plugging their latest album
Let Go. No strangers to the live
scene, the band play with confi-
dence, combining upbeat progres-
sive rock with disquieting lyrics
about isolation, fear and loss.
With hints of New Order and
Flaming Lips, the new material
sounds edgier live and contrasts
nicely with the anticipated riot of
the Aussie boys' main set.
Formed through a mutual
hatred of working at McDonalds,
The Vines spent their first gigs
doing Nirvana covers at wedding
receptions, and these early influ-
ences provide the essence of their
garage rock.
Kicking off their set with killer
first single 'Highly Evolved', a 90-
second rush of mammoth riffs
and shredded vocal chords, Craig
Nicholls' stage presence is pre-
dictably manic. Meanwhile,
bassist Patrick Matthews and
drummer Dave Olliffe are res-
olutely deadpan.
With little banter between
songs, The Vines are happy to let
the music do the talking, rattling
through crowd-pleasers
'Outtathaway' and 'Get Free' with
cavalier cool, whilst their cover of
Outkast's 'Miss Jackson' is haunt-
ingly melancholic; an upbeat rap-
per's brag transformed into a des-
perate plea for forgiveness.
The rest of the set is devoted to
the band's quieter side, with the
epic sounds of 'Autumn Shade'
and 'Mary Jane' filling the venue
with soaring guitars and ethereal
vocals. It is with these songs,
however, that the band's perform-
ance falters.
Shameless use of the reverb
pedal and tedious Floyd-esque
solos cause even the die-hard
teenagers to become restless.
They want noise. Big dirty slabs
of it.
Judging by the quantity of
drinks being thrown at the stage,
The Vines oblige not a moment
too soon, returning to form with a
frenzied encore of the instantly
likeable 'Ain't No Room', which
brings about a state of euphoria
amongst the acne'd masses. And
me too, for it's at their most out-
rageous that The Vines' live per-
formance excels.

Jesse Malin+Ryan Adams
Royal Festival Hall, 11th November
4 / 5
Tonight the audience at the Royal
Festival Hall of London is quite
unusual. Not known to embrace
the populist, the Hungerford
Bridge Hall is full with people
wearing jeans and T-shirts. This
Monday, pop replaces classical in
the 'Royal' venue of South Bank.
Ryan Adams is the producer of
his debut album 'The Fine Art of
Self Destruction', Ryan Adams
plays the guitar on this album, so
it was obvious that Jesse Malin
would support Ryan Adams on his
solo tour throughout Europe.
Alone on stage with only an
acoustic guitar, Jesse Malin begins
his show in front of an audience
who doesn't know this young guy
from New York.
The first thing that I feel, is the
similarity between Jesse Malin
and Ryan Adams: he plays beauti-
ful pop songs telling stories about
life in NY.
Not used to playing in this kind
of venue, he is not afraid at all:
talking with the audience, pre-
senting the next songs, Jesse
Malin impresses by his audacity. I
didn't know him a lot, just reading
good review of his album in Uncut
Magazine (new album of the
month in November but I rarely
feel such emotions for a first part
of a concert. Usually, you just go
to the bar for a beer, talk with your
friend waiting for the main band.
But the venue was quiet, listening
to Jesse Malin as he was the main
performer. If you like songwriters,
you have to see him in December
at the Spitz, you won't regret it!
After this, Ryan Adams made a
huge performance with an about
two-hour set: no band, just him
on stage and his songs. If some-
one doubted about the talent of
Ryan Adams "one of the most
revered songwriter-performers of
his generation", he proved at the
London gig the contrary. He per-
forms songs of his albums 'Gold'
and 'Demolition'. Forgetting the
overproduced album versions, he
enjoys the audience of SE1 with
pure emotive songs.
A fan of both Oasis and The
Rolling Stones, he gives his own
versions of 'Wonderwall' and
'Brown Sugar'.
In conclusion, a very good con-
cert, which was not unexpected
because of the singers, and the
classical atmosphere in the venue.

3CR
It's Feet First at Camden Palace
and the teeny-boppers are out
in their hordes. As the clock
strikes twelve, 3 Colours Red
step on stage to rock the Palace
to the ground.
They are the band once labelled
"hotter than Oasis" - responsi-
ble for such hits as 'Beautiful
Day' and 'Sixty Mile Smile'.
3CR retreated from the world of
rock in 1999 due to the usual
"musical differences," but today
they're back with a vengeance.
Currently talking to several
labels about their future and
about to begin a European tour
in December, guitarist Pete
Vuckovic seems rather enthusi-
astic about their next step for-
ward. "The new stuff's com-
pletely different but there's
still some of the old influences
in there - people seem to enjoy
it."
The youthful crowd at the
Palace seem to agree as the
moshing heads and sporadic
crowd-surfers create a welcom-
ing atmosphere. After the per-
formance, the band compare
tonight's reception with past
experiences: "Yeah I've been
here twice before, this is the
third time. I didn't actually
enjoy the first two years but
tonight was... good. You hear
about these gigs where there's
like six people at the front and
everyone else is at the bar. No,
tonight was great."
Trying to dig for the real reasons
of the group's "split" three years
ago is near impossible as
Vuckovic cleverly skirts over
more personal details. He
appears hurt by the music busi-
ness. His opinion of those who
decide the fate of all in the
music scene is critically brutal:
"Big record labels just don't
know how to manufacture rock
bands - they have no knowl-
edge or contact with the gener-
al public. Bands like Led
Zeppelin sold thousands of
albums without releasing one
single.
