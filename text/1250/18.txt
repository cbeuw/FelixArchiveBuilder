A New Morning
4 / 5
I'm going to award this taster of 'A
New Morning' 4/5, despite it
making me cringe repeatedly.
The main cause of the frequent
wincings are the lyrics.
True: as far as most bands are
concerned, it's best not to listen
too hard to the lyrics, but these
are especially cliched in both sub-
ject, technique and content.
Apart from "Obsessions",
which is truly hideous, I am pre-
pared to forgive this album for its
flaws.
What we have here, is a prime
cut of chart-friendly, feel-good,
glam-pop; amply demonstrated
by the opener, "Positivity". Happy
guitar riffs, happy drumming,
happy bass-lines, happy every-
thing.
Technically, I shouldn't like this
album; I find myself distracted by
a beautiful melody, or an engulf-
ing harmony. I don't mind "Astro
Girl"s, 'A strange experience is
starting, between her molecules
and me', simply because I'm lost
in the strings, being propelled
along by a bouncy bass riff.
The songs presented here are
not for the noisy complainers of
indie; nor are they for the happy
clappy pre-pubescent pop mar-
ket. I'd like to bet that your mum
would like these songs, but I
wouldn't start to throw derogato-
ry acronyms -such as AOR and
MOR - at them just yet.
Harmonic, melodic, slightly
embarrassing, and engulfing.

Foo Fighters
One By One
5/5
Music Felix's resident domina-
trix presents to you, the mighty
Foo Fighters!
Three albums down the line,
lambasted heavily for the last
one's mellowed, passionless,
non-Foo sentiments, the most
famous rock star in the world,
Dave Grohl, and his merry men
decided that things were going
to get better.
Working with the heavier
QOTSA, and drumming for
David Bowie, helped him to
gain the passion and vitality the
Foos once had, they got things
right, and have come back big-
ger and bolder than ever before!
At some point in his absurdly
busy 2002, Dave Grohl man-
aged to record his fourth album
with the Foos. Twice. When the
first effort was deemed too
glossy, Grohl bunked off on tour
with the marvellous Queens
and, on his return, bashed off
'One By One' Take Two in dou-
ble-quick time.
It shows, in the best possible
ways. 'One By One' is a rawer,
gristlier album than any Foos
outing since their debut. The
compelling pop hooks (three per
song, on average), FM accessi-
bility, and headbanging potential
are all present. But Grohl and
his three cohorts deliver them in
a punchier, frequently darker
style.
There are love songs, in the
main, but on the likes of 'Low'
he endows them with a moodier,
more oppressive edge. It's hard
to imagine the Queens beating
Grohl's inherent niceness out of
him, but they've certainly taught
him how to rough up his edges.
The listener is still drenched in
melody while listening to the
Foos record, and rightly, I hope,
this won't change. Even with the
snarling lead track, 'All My Life'
there is tune held within every
growling holler. You still have to
sing along to it all. The vocals
on 'Have It AN' there is a long-
ing; a pleading in his voice that
seems refreshing because it's
genuine. Then in 'Times Like
These' the vocal are less sung
and seem sharper and more
direct. Class! Sajini

Young Heart Attack - Tommy
Shots
Imagine if "Tell Me More" (that
annoying tune from Grease: The
Musical (Argh!)) were sung by a
seventies glam metal band,
with Noddy from Slade as the
male vocalist. Now decide
whether that's good, novel, feel-
good or annoying. You can cer-
tainly twist to it.
This is kinda cool seventies
retro - ie. nothing like The
Strokes or The Libertines. It's
pretty fast paced and doesn't let
up for the duration of the cd. I
have no idea what the bloke is
singing (cf. Noddy from Slade),
but he wears me out; it's some-
thing about drugs, I think.
So, if you're in a good mood,
and you like grated vocals, and
20th Century Boy, this cd'll
pump you full of energy and
drag you up onto your feet. If
you listen to it more that once
(on consecutive occasions), or if
you're in a bad mood, you'll
probably scream, "Shut the
f**k up!" at your stereo, before
taking some deep breaths to
calm you down.
Exhausting, in some sort of
way.

Amerie (featuring Ludacris) -
Why Don't We Fall In Love
OK, so I was highly sceptical
when the editor passed me this
single and asked me to review it
- not my cup of tea, thought I.
The track starts with a 'gangsta
crap' intra but actually pans out
to be a pleasure to listen to.
Amerie has a stunning voice,
the melodies in this song are
pleasant to the ear and, aside
from Ludacris's attempt at input
into this single, it makes for
very nice music. Worth a listen
as I think Amerie does this song
proud. Shame about Ludacris
though...
