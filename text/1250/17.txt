It looks pretty good on paper doesn't it? A sub-
marine movie made by Americans that glorifies
the Soviets. Ford and Neeson starring, Point
Break and Strange Days director Bigelow
onboard (sic) and a very smart sounding title.
Unfortunately that's where the goodness ends Snowball fight anyone?
and the crapness starts to seep in. As stories go,
it's quite an effective one, centred on a true
story of the ill-fated voyage of the Soviet "super-
sub" during the height of the Cold War. The
effects, while not being anywhere near as good
as those in U-571 (I love the depth-charge
sequence in that movie - great for tuning sub-
woofers), are good and the soundtrack is quite
stirring. But the dodgy Russian accents, the
cliche-ridden script and the general stodginess
of the movie drags this particular fish down into
the depths of film dross. Where it belongs,
frankly. The worst Harrison Ford movie I've ever
seen (yes, that includes Sabrina) and only real-
ly appealing to the die-hard Submariner.

Recent special effects driven re-adaptation of the
classic H. G. Wells tale of time-travel and
Morlocks. I enjoyed this movie for the first half-an-
hour or so, but was then gutted to find it totally
losing its way from then onwards. I've seen a few
of the previous movies based on the book (there
have been many, most notably the 1960 George
Pal version) and this one fails to hold a torch to
them despite boasting a great lead in Pearce,
direction by Wells' great-grandson and a huge
effects budget. The plot begins promisingly and
the movie looks fantastic, but the minute that
Pearce travels forwards in time it rapidly becomes
a confusing sequence of events that bear all the
signs of a rush job. It's as if Wells Jr. lost interest
half way through and decided to get the thing
done so he could meet Ms Mumba down the pub
for a swift half. Which is a shame because it
looked promising. I mean, 95 minutes for The
Time Machine? Ah well. The DVD extras are aver-
age at best, with a promising (but disappointing)
commentary from Wells and not much else. They
could have at least sprung for a seance to contact
H.G. and ask for his opinion... Si Morlocks just LOVE fire.

Don't worry - they don't stay alive for very
long
I virtually guarantee that at least seventy-five
percent of you won't have heard of this one!
Well, in this time of Popstars (The Rivals),
Celebrity Big Brother, Fame Academy, Fight
School, Model Behaviour and Temptation
Island I thought it was time to teach you the
proper meaning of reality TV. Sort of. Picture
the scene - an idyllic island somewhere miles
away from civilisation. A country (Japan) with
an over-population problem. Put two and two
together and if you come up with 7.9 then
you'll have sussed the solution - take classes
of school children to the island, give them a
selection of weaponry and the last girl or boy
standing wins the right to become a member
of society.
Oh yes, this is one sick film - but it is much
more too. In amongst the violence (which I
would rate as "ultra" grade brutality by the
way) there are some great moments of
teenage anguish as well as some touching
scenes - particularly in the special edition
(which has the extra scenes spliced into the
feature). An odd movie, but for any Japanese
movie fan or Horror aficionado, a must see. It
even includes the staple "Makes No Sense"
ending, which in my book is the mark of a
truly classic Japanese film - I have enjoyed
many a Manga movie and am yet to under-
stand the final message.
Apparently there will be a re-release of
Fukasaku's earlier work on DVD soon - none
of which I have seen (apart from Tora! Tora!
Tora!) but on the strength of this piece I'll def-
initely be taking a look.
