Released and Deleted 3CR
In recent times, music fans have
come across an odd craze by their
beloved bands. To wit: A deluge of
single releases by the likes of The
Vines, White Stripes, Datsuns,
Garbage and Electric Soft Parade
that have been 'Released and
deleted on the same day;' which
has baffled many fans who have
asked 'What's the difference
between this and 'limited edition'
singles?'
The difference is that the record
companies themselves specify
how many limited edition singles
are printed (For example:3,000
copies) and once they've sold out,
then there are no more copies.
With deleted on the same day sin-
gles, it's up to the record shops to
place a pre-order on however
many copies they want to stock,
up until the day of release when
they will no longer be able to order
any more.
This means that the onus is on
the record shops to decide how
well the single will sell and the
usual record shop ethos is not to
disappoint the customer and so, in
accordance with normal practice,
they will over-stock the single to
make sure they don't sell out too
quickly. This has the result of the
single acquiring more shelf space
then it may have done otherwise,
which will lead to further purchas-
es by casual music buyers.
It will also result in fans who
may already have the album (or
intend to purchase it) to buy the
single because of the collector's
value. Once a piece of music no
longer becomes available, it
means that the copies that have
been bought will go up in value,
leaving the buyers with a collec-
tor's item in their mitts: It would
appear that this has as much to do
with psychology as actually liking
the music, since these releases
often fetch up to £10 on websites.
As with any marketing ploy,
there are downsides. As great as
The Music's debut album is, some
fans would argue that if you stuck
all the tracks from their 4 EPs onto
one CD, then you'd have en even
better one. However, new converts
to the band will not be able to
make their own judgement, since
all of them have been deleted,
leaving them having to try and pay
highly for copies from the shops,
or make do with grubby recordings
from the internet.
However, the big question for
the bands is: Does this tactic actu-
ally work? The answer would
appear to be, it depends who you
are. All of the above acts charted
in the 20s, with their singles,
which is probably what they would
have expected anyway.
Although The Manics got to #1,
it has to be said that they would
have probably done so anyway
with a single that wasn't going to
be on an album and so would be
the fans' only chance of hearing it
(Until the Greatest Hits album,
natch). Although Doves and BDB
have both benefited, it could be
argued that another factor was the
main cause of their success: -
Price. (Admittedly, both were also
songs of the highest class)
Both went on sale at £1 as
opposed to £2-3. ESP were baffled
when 'Silent To The Dark' went in
at #23 priced at £1 but the fol-
low-up at £3 scraped in at #39.
More serious music fans tend to
shun singles in favour of albums
because they are cheaper when
compared with the amount you
pay for each track. You would
think that if all singles were £1
then there would be no problem,
but actually the record companies
generally lose money when releas-
ing singles due to the cost of pro-
motion for very little profits on
each single. The main point of sin-
gles is to promote the album that
they're from, which is a bigger
money-spinner for all concerned.
However, fans are already begin-
ning to wear thin of this ruse. The
latest ploy coming into effect is the
one-week only release. Both Turin
Brakes and U2 and doing this with
single and album respectively, but
this would appear to be pretty inef-
fective if you're trying to increase
your audience as it means new
fans won't be able to hear their
material.
It looks like until singles become
permanently cheaper, the charts
will continue to be as rotten as
ever.

Matthew Get Down to Talk...
Through the power of the inter-
net, lead singer Brian McSweeney
took some time out to fill us in.
'I chose the name Matthew
because I wanted a person's
name. I think it gives the band
and the music a more personal
feel.'
I would classify our music as
'passionate, honest rock music'.
Paul Kolderie, Radiohead's
producer for 'The Bends' was
amazing to work with. He pushed
us and brought things out in us
that were special I think. I grew
up listening to everything - Duran
Duran, Madonna, gospel music,
Neil Diamond, Aha, Julian
Lennon...
My favourite album so far of
this year is the new Sigur Ros. It
just came out on the 28th, and
it's amazing.
Other than that - Massive
Attack, 'Mezzanine' never leaves
my stereo.
Both small gigs and festivals
are great fun to play, as long as
we can connect with the people
there.
I agree with the banning of the
crowd surfing in Britain - its shit.
It's not what the music is about.
Go to a show to listen to music;
take out physical aggression
somewhere else.
As far as the age restriction, if
you mean a restriction on who
gets in to the show I think that's
shit too.
I'm still going to be going to
doing loud shows when I'm 75.
MATTHEW'S debut album,
"Everybody Down" is out now on
Rykodisc. Keira

If you're not U2 or Mariah
Carey, you haven't got a
chance."
The apathy of today's youth
is on the minds of 3CR as talk
turns to world events since
September 11th. Obviously not
fans of America taking over the
world "Bush scares me. His
eyes are too close together,"
Vuckovic later confesses, they
seem frustrated with the
nation's attitude towards cur-
rent affairs: "People are more
bothered with their own lives.
They'd rather look through OK
magazine and be like, "Oo,
there's Robbie Williams."
People just don't care.
Although 3CR blatantly do care,
they have other worries on their
plate; the writing and recording
of their latest album being one
of them. However, it would
seem they don't have to go
through it alone with some
unusual friends offering their
help. As the discussion of the
latest Manics revival arises,
Vuckovic cleverly lets their
acquaintance slip. "Actually his
(James Dean Bradfield's) gui-
tar is at my house for the
moment," he smiles, "just
while we record this album."
Always nice to have friends in
high places.
p SINGLE OF THE WEEK - |
I The Streets - Don't Mug -|
I Yourself
Described by Mike Skinner
as ' the lairiest track on the
album', 'Don't Mug Yourself
was recorded after a drunk-
en night out. Over catchy
bass beats, Mike Skinner
emcees about the discus-
sion between him and his
mates over what to do
about a girl. Complete with
funny lyrics reminiscent of
life, this is a great track.
