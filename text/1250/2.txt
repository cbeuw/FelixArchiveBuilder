News In Brief
Rebranding Back Under Way
Since the calling off of the
Merger, College has begun get-
ting back to what it was doing
when the whole thing blew up in
the first place. The rebranding
has now once again become the
first priority in the Sherfield
Building, and in case you had all
forgotten during the excitement
of us becoming 'Imperial College
University College London'
(ICUCL) the original plan had
been for us to rebrand to
'Imperial College London', which
shortens to 'Imperial'
The powers that be have
decided that IC was not a strik-
ing enough brand name, and
that the full name of Imperial
College of Science, Technology
and Medicine was too much of a
mouthful.
Evidence of this new brand
should be hitting College over
the next few weeks, and will
really get under way towards the
beginning of next term.

Mikee B. Well, he's one of them...
Mikee B. plays Imperial
Felix has exclusively learned that
top DJ Mikee B, from Radio
One's Dreem Teem will be play-
ing a set at the Christmas
Carnival which will be on at the
end of this term.
This is part of the new ents
drive to make the Union more
accessible, and more of a venue
than just somewhere to go for a
cheap drink. If you would like to
have your opinion heard, please
contact the ents team on
