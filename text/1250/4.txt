Snowdon Blue
Snowdonia is the second largest
national park in England and
Wales, covering some 2,171
square kilometres of north west
Wales, and including the
Carneddau, and Glyderau moun-
tain ranges as well as the highest
mountain in England and Wales
(1085m/3560ft)- Yr Wyddfa (the
Tomb in welsh), or Snowdon from
which the Park takes its (English)
name. This was our destination,
and a popular one too. We all
arrived at the union on Friday
night hoping to pile in the bus
and set off for sunny Wales. This
proved a little complicated, as the
bus was blocked in and much
faffing was required before we
could get it out and load it up at
the union. Eventually we all piled
in. Enthusiastically I pulled the
passenger door shut thinking we
were all ready to go.
Unfortunately however that car
door meet Matt's fingers on the
way... Matt's fingers appeared to
be a bit dented from this experi-
ence and so we sought medical
help. Thankfully there were no
breaks, and Matt was given the
all clear to travel.
So off we pootled, along the car
parks that we English people call
roads. We discovered a new chip-
py in Daventry, and finally arrived
at the hut at about 1.30am, at
which point I walked in on one of
the other residents who was
undressing at that precise
moment. In the morning we
amazed the climbers we were
sharing the hut with by rising
promptly at 7am. The weather
looked great so one group set off
up Snowdon, and the other along
the Nantle Ridge. The Snowdon
group later split as some took the
Crib Goch route and some took a
shorter route in order to allow
time for them to go shopping in
Betws-y-Coed. There were only
fleeting views from the top of
Snowdon, but the Nantle ridge
group enjoyed amazing views of
the mountains and sea, and prac-
ticed a bit off their off path navi-
gation too.
Alex conjured up a wonderful
Spaghetti Bolognaise for dinner,
and we heated apple pies on the
stove for pudding. Sam got the
fire burning bright.... In fact it
was a bit like a sauna in there! As
per usual a variety of classic
games and drinking followed
including the cornflake box game,
ladder game and various other
tests of strength, balance and stu-
pidity. The climbers had a distinct
advantage in most of these areas,
but there were some good efforts
from Sarah and Matt in the corn-
flake box game.
After another late night we did
ourselves proud by rising yet
again at 7am, and setting off for
Cnict. Cnict is known as the
Welsh Matterhorn, because if you
look at it from just the right angle,
squinting your eyes a bit, you can
sort of see the resemblance with
the real Matterhorn. The weather
was truly glorious - blue sky and
sunshine... you would hardly
know that we were in Wales at
all! The climb up had us all pant-
ing, but it was well worth it for
the amazing views across the
national park. We were particular-
ly pleased to see that there was
still a little bit of cloud on the
summit of Snowdon.... it's nice to
know that even on a clear day you
are still doomed not to get a view
from it. After reaching the summit
of Cnict we descended to an old
slate quarry for lunch and then
ambled back to the bus in plenty
of time for the journey home.
We left Snowdonia via one of
the smallest roads imaginable. I
realised I had definitely chosen
the wrong seat when I found
myself getting out every five min-
utes in order to open a gate.
Eventually we made it onto
decent road only to find that the
bus had lost most of its power.
We did a bit of investigation and
decided to carry on, as nothing
too serious seemed to be wrong.
Stopping at the Wheatsheaf in
Crick we found they no longer
served meals, and had to find a
new pub, we were due some luck,
and thankfully found a nice new
pub, which will no doubt become
a fellwanderers classic. The bus
continued to play up a bit, but we
made it home before 11, which is
pretty good for us lot.
Another great weekend -
Thanks to all who partook!
