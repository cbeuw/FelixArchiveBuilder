The Naked i
Edited by Fred R. Karl and Leo Hamalian
Pan Picador—Price 60p.
The naked i is extraordinary. It is a collection
of short stories in the narrative. This is the type
of book that is probably a little difficult to read
initially but with such a variety of stories and
styles that it is possible to come back to the
book time and time again, in different moods
and with varied demands. It is difficult to know
where to start in trying to describe to you what
to expect, since most of the stories are truly
excellent. In particular Leonard Cohen's contri-
bution deserves mentioning. His story, ' A iong
letter from F' is written in his typical earthy,
Jewish-Canadian style. The description of his
afternoon with 'F' in a hotel bedroom leaves one
tense and frustrated . . .
'We both leapt for the vibrator at the same
instant. Her fluids made her slippery. For a
second in our struggle, I wished we were making
love, for all her nozzles were stiff and fragrant.
I grabbed her around the waist; before I knew it
her bum popped out of my bearhug like a wet
watermelon seed, her thighs went by like a
missed train, and there I was with empty lubri-
cated arms, rose squashed against the expensive
mahogany floor'.
Story contrasts with story; some frightening,
others exciting while LeRoi Jones in 'Answers in
Progress' even uses the layout of the print in
his story to enhance it. One has a feeling that
as you read through any particular story that the
writer is right there in the room performing the
very actions that he describes to you from the
pages of his book. The actions seem very vivid
and very, very real. Smells and sounds surround
you—in Franz Kafka's 'A Country Doctor', the
intense fear as the doctor rides out into a bliz-
zard from a deserted country village to answer
the urgent call of one of his patients is very
strongly felt by the reader. Perhaps this is it,
this is what these writers have attempted to
produce, a feeling of involvement and realisa-
tion. If it is, then they have succeeded in their
task.
This book is a brilliant vision into the minds
of many good writers. Highly recommended.

On Saturday night a
somewhat small audi-
ence were treated to a
presentation of Dick
Heckstall-Smith's first
solo album by a band he
has gathered for live
work. This band fea-
tures Jim Litherland on
guitar, ex of Colosseum
and Mogul Thrash along
with the latter's rhythm
section John Dentith
and Bill Smith. Dave
Rose completes the line-
up on keyboards. All
are accomplished musi-
cians but the vocals
were rather disappoint-
ing apart from Lither-
land whose distinctive
voice was featured on
the last two numbers
"Same Old Thing" and
"The Pirate's Dream".
The band opened with
"Moses in the Bullrush-
hoursus" a number rem-
iniscent of the collabor-
ations that Pete Brown
has had with Colosseum.
Following "What the
Morning Was After"
they played "Crabs" &
"Future Song" featuring
excellent solos by Rose
and Dentith on wah-wah
electric piano, and
drums respectively. Then
came "Same 0 I d
Thing", a slow number
with a blues feel which
wasn't restricted to the
usual twelve or eight
bar form. Litherland's
solo in this showed how
his playing has improved
since the days of "Val-
entyne Suite". The num-
ber also included some
nice sax by Dick, especi-

Reviews
I C S
THE HEIST
(Richard Brooks)
Warren Beatty, Goldie Hawn, Gert Frobe
120 mins.
THE GODFATHER
(F. F. Coppola)
Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cain
175 mins.
(ABC 1, Empire, Paramount,
Universal).
Variety is the spice of
life, we say with a smile,
but the smile soon fades
when we discover that
the variety is from good
to bad. First the bad
news—THE HEIST. I
will try to be polite.
The acting is not ex-
ceptional—either way.
How Goldie Hawn has
earned the reputation of
a natural actress must
remain the well guarded
secret of Goldie Hawn
and even the fine per-
formance by Gert Frobe
as the overweight, over-
anxious, overzealous
bank manager cannot
pull the film through.
Warren Beatty is in an
easy role—good guy
(but bad really although
we all love the little dar-
ling), who is security
consultant to Herr Jes-
sel's bank in Hamburg.
He sets up an emergen-
cy, gets himself locked
in the strong room, all
according to plan, and
removes large quantities
of cash from the deposit
boxes of narcotics smug-
glers. When he is freed
he is a hero until the
smugglers come to get
their money. They can't
go to the police but nor
can he so they chase
him, etc., etc., etc.
The only good line
of the film (I can't even
be nice about the script)
is when Goldie Hawn,
through the gasps and
pants of delight at see-
ing so many million dol-
lars enquires whether
there is a connection
between crime and sex
—-very subtle.
The photography is
standard in line with
lighting and special ef-
fects. It seems amazing
that anyone should make
a film about a bank rob-
bery as though it was an
original idea. Stay away.
It is difficult not to
overreact to a film like
the Heist when seeing
the next cellulose pro-
duction, but a film like
"The Godfather" does
seem to warrant a great
many superlatives.
It has been said that
the story includes the
life of Frank Sinatra and
it is fact that the original
lead choice was scared
of playing the part; I re-
frain from comment.
The story is about the
Mafia as it was in New
York post W.W.II. Five
families are involved,
mostly it seems from
Sicily and the film fol-
lows events from one
family's viewpoint. It is
all too easy to strongly
identity with the Corl-
sone family and to sym-
pathise.
Even their violence
one excuses (or at least
it doesn't register that
the violence is of their
doing). It made me sad
that there has to be a
good guy in any tale,
and the film was made
all the more powerful
when the last good guy
was turned sour. The
most moving, the most
sickening moment in the
film is not when a man
wakes up with his
horse's head in his bed
but when a single word
is uttered a single den-
ial.
Marion Brando is
truly superb and bril-
liantly supported. The
Godfather is a film of
power, and a powerful
film.
