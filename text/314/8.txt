THE SPORTS COLUMN
or, should we say
THE RUGBY COLUMN
Hello there folks! This is your roving reporter ALJ
bringing you the up-to-date match reports from IC
fflugby Football Club M XV.
The 1st X V began the front of the posts kicked
season in fine style by de-
feating arch rivals U C on
their own ground by 40-3
Wednesday, 11th Oc-
on
tober. U C won the toss,
and elected to play with a
strong wind in the first half
This who ever was to no
avail because from the
kick off IC were imme-
diately on the attack.
However, with the aid of
the wind UC managed, on
several occasions, when IC
looked like scoring, to
drive the IC back with
long kicks. It was from
one of these sorties into
the UC 25 that IC scored
their first of seven tries.
From a superbly won
rucked ball near the posts,
Flanagan made the initial
break for the ball to travel
out along the threequart-
ers and McDonough
touched down in the cor-
ner The conversion failed.
UC briefly came back into
the game with a penalty in
front of the posts when an
unknown IC outside half
infringed. Their success
was short lived however
when Flanagan again
made the initial break to
send Jim (thank god for
the new law) Hunt over in
the corner. A penalty in
by Rimmer completed the
scoring in the first half and
IC turned round 11-3 up.
IC now had the wind in
the 2nd half, and it even
proved to be quite an ad-
vantage. From a position
deep inside the V C the
ball came over to James,
who dropped a goal which
did NOT go over off the
post. This opening'score in
the second half proved to
be the basis of an avalan-
che of points, five more
tries being scored in the
2nd half by IC. The best
of the day was a com-
bined handling movement
between backs and for-
wards and ended up with
Matthews (last as usual)
going over wide out.
A superb start to the
season then, with many
UC players close to tears
at the end having been run
off their feet by a rampant
(pardon!) IC pack. U C
had no answer even after
Ossie had left the field
midway through the sec-
ond half.

HOW NOT TO
GET NICKED
Nick Gregory the Union Solicitor gave a short talk
on "Problems with the Law" on Thursday. Although
attended by both the Union President and Seeretary(!)
the talk failed to attract many other people. The
reason for this may very well have been that the
missing thousands expected a treatise on "How Not
to Get Busted for Drugs and Other Offences Not Nor-
mally Associated With The Average Straight Student".
In fact it was nothing of the kind, to my immeasurable
disappointment—oh what a giveaway !
He opened the lecture of the talk was virtually
by informing us that of
70 queries he had re-
ceived in the year ending
June, 9 were concerned
with goods and services,
21 were motoring offen-
ces, 15 were miscellane-
ous, which ranged from
naturalization problems to
one concerned with stu-
dent demonstrations — I
wonder who? The remain-
ing 25 were to do with
"Landlord and Tenant"
and this was I suppose a
good enough reason for
the greater part of the
talk being taken up with
this subject. Indeed, it
might well have attracted
a few more people had it
been titled "Problems
with Landlords".
Unfortunately this part
a recital of facts which
can be found in the ex-
cellent "Alternative Lon-
don" although he did
emphasize several times
that people in lodgings or
in a flat belonging or ren-
ted singly by another stu-
dent can be kicked out at
any time without four
weeks notice or a court
order. Then there was the
usual jibe about Accom-
modation Bureaux being
parasites and how it was
illegal for them to charge
tenants, and how you can
get your deposit back by
not paying the last month's
rent, and other tips most
of us had heard before.
Mr. Gregory then
ceeded to motoring
pro-
and
admitted that a 'palm-
tree justice" prevails in
that even when vou think
you're innocent it's cheap-
er to plead guilty, "act
sweet" and get off with a
five quid fine than to lash
out 50 guineas hiring a
barrister to prove that
you're in the right, a situ-
ation which seems to put
motorists at the mercy of
the police (and barristers).
For more serious cases the
Insurance Company will
probably pay for your de-
fence as they will be pay-
ing your damages if you're
found guilty. (The Union
Secretary was seen to
laugh at this point). He
also raised the problems
of losing the hallowed "no
claims bonus".
Over the problems of
Criminal Proceedings and
legal aid "Alternative
London" was again quo-
ted extensively and 1
would advise those people
who regret missing the
talk to consult that worthy
tome. I found the talk
rather disappointing.
