Any time now, if you stop and listen
carefully, you'll be able to hear the patter
of little footsteps heading in your direc-
tion. But don't worry. The footsteps we're
concerned with are not such as will cause
you to search your conscience. We refer,
as it happens, to the insurance salesman.
He'll be doing his level best to sell
you an insurance policy. No doubt, he will
give you many reasons why you ought to
buy. So many, in fact, that you may feel
you cannot go on another day without get-
ting insured. But before you run for cover,
insurance wise, it might be as well to find
out if you really need it. Ask yourself one
or two questions. Or, better still, ask him.
We suggest the conversation might
go like this...
Student: Before we
go any further, may 1
ask a direct question.
Why should I buy insur-
ance?
Salesman: For some
good reasons. For one
thing, it's cheaper when
you're young. Sooner or
later, you'll be thinking
about buying a house.
Insurance now will help
you with that later. You
may have a family.
You'll need to protect
them with insurance.
Why not start now? Our
company views the
problems of students
very seriously. We de-
sign flexible policies
particularly for the
younger man.
Student: Yes, I'm
young. But I'm single
and have no depend-
ents. More important, i
have no money. How
much cheaper will it be
to buy insurance now,
compared, say, to three
years' time, when I'm
earning? Would you say
pounds—or pennies?
Salesman: Well, pen-
nies. But there are many
other reasons for buying
now.
Student: Yes, you
mentioned that. One of
the reasons was house
purchase. How, exactly,
will insurance help me
there?
Salesman: You can
borrow against the pol-
icy at a future date —
that is when you're
ready to buy a house.
Student: But I'd like
to know how much I can
borrow. Suppose I buy
an endowment policy
with profits, which is
going to cost me five
pounds a month. How
much can I borrow on
that in three years'
time?
. . . said the
student to
the salesman
Salesman: The l o a n
value.
Student: How much
is that?
S a l e sman Ninety-
five per cent •— some-
times even 100 per cent
of the cash surrender
value.
Student: S o u n d s
great. But what will that
amount to?
allow me to borrow
£135 of my own money
—presumably subject to
interest — to help me
buy a house? T h a t
wouldn't even buy me
the front doorstep,
would it?
Salesman: I merely
said it would help.
There are other types of
policy. But even if we
This is the first of a regular series of
articles on financial matters by DEREK
E. CUMMINGS, an incorporated insur-
ance broker who is known to students
and faculty at Imperial College for his
lectures on similar subjects over the
past five years. In his financial page
articles, he will expound his own forth-
right views on the mysterious subject of
money—and how to hang on to it.
Salesman: A b o u t
three-quarters of the
premiums paid.
Student: Hold on a
moment. Three-quarters
of the premiums paid.
That's . . . let me see
. . . about £135 of my
money. Are you saying
that your company will
stick to this endowment
policy, there are many
benefits for you. It
amounts to a long-term
investment. It will be a
tidy sum for you in later
life, or for that rainy
day.
Student: Alright, let's
consider that. Just how
long will it take your
company—as you say,
one of the most compet-
itive in the land — to
double the value of my
premiums?
Salesman: With bon-
uses calculated on a
compound basis, you
will see the value of
your policy growing
rapidly. According to
my calculations, we
take only 15/17 years
to double your money.
Thats' worth thinking
about.
Student: I agree. But
I'm also thinking about
a report by Mr. Terence
Higgins, Secretary of
State to the Treasury,
who recently stated that
this country is taking
only 8/10 years to
HALVE the real value of
money.
Salesman: Who?
Student: It doesn't
matter. The point is that
if I buy a policy from
you to save for a rainy
day, all I shall get is
wet.
Salesman: Alright,
but you'll agree, surely,
that when you are mar-
ried and have a family,
you are going to need
insurance to protect
them?
Student- Yes. But I'm
not married now, and to
the best of my belief, 1
have no children. In the
circumstances, I think
I'd be wiser to think
about insurance when I
I
do have those respon-
sibilities. Why don't you
leave me your card?
Salesman: My card?
Student: Yes. I'll call
you when I need you.
Salesman: Oh yes .
. . . my card.
Student: Look, all I'm
saying is this. You're
obviously a man who is
well aware of the pre-
sent situation regarding
housing, the economy
and so on. Don't you
think I'd be better em-
ployed putting whatever
little money I can spare
into a building society?
After all, with more and
more young people like
myself coming into the
house buying market
every year, the building
societies are going to be
under pressure, aren't
they?And they are going
to be a little more care-
ful who they lend
money to, meaning that
they are going to give
priority to their own
investors. And if that's
true, I think I'd be fool-
ish to start buying in-
surance before I need
it. Don't you agree? I
mean, really?

series will appear on
November 6th.
ELECTIONS
. who needs them ?
I suppose that to ail those of you who
are seasoned salts of Imperial College, the
forthcoming elections must seem quite as
common place and necessary as a visit to the
water closet. Certainly, none of you seem to
be in a frenzy of excitement over them . . .
which is hardly surprising since hardly any
of you are standing for anything.
You will therefore con-
sider it strange for me to
tell you that I find them
rather interesting. About
as interesting as an anti-
clockwise c o r k s c r e w
would be to a barman.
Who, pray tell me,
NEEDS all these elections
—and, more relevant still,
who needs people to do
all these jobs anyway?
(M.C.B., of course — who
did you think wanted
them?—Ed.)
I would be quite pre-
pared to believe that there
just might be a perfectly
sane answer to this ques-
tion. You probably think
me a twit for not knowing
it. You are perfectly right,
of course. I suppose that
I should have knocked up
the Rector and requested
an explanation, or gone
and seen M.C.B. and
asked for an oration, or
should have w a d e d
through either the I.C.
Archives or the Union
Green Blue Book (what's
the difference, please?) in
order to find out. but I
didn't find I doubt if
I'd have been any the
wiser if I had. Come to
think of it, I doubt if
many of the other 1,700
freshers bothered to find
out either.
So please come on,
shake a leg in whatever
department should shake
a leg, and INFORM us
(Sorry, they h a v e n ' t
elected the I.C. Union
Leg Shaker yet — a n y
nominations?—Ed.). We
are the masses, suscept-
ible to whatever you put
out for us to see, so use it.
Don't just ask for nom-
inations for the Presi-
dency or whatever it is,
for all I know it might
just be another lolite
name for a lavatory
attendant (and we've got
enough of those in our
family as it is!)—tell us
about the post and what
the job entails. Maybe
then somebody m i g h t
stand to do something.
To get anywhere you need
Action AND Words
- : • says Mike Doherty, Academic Affairs Office
Now that Freshers' Week has passed
and most of you have settled down into
another academic (?) year, it seems
appropriate that I should mention a few of
the more important issues concerning
academic affairs (wot are they?—Ed.).
Without doubt, the
most important method
of communicating with
the staff, at an influen-
tial level, is via the de-
partmental staff-student
committee. High-level
talks with the College
administration are nec-
essarily important but of
no practical use whatso-
ever if the results don't
filter into the depart-
ments. Quite apart from
this, the departments
are so independent of
the college administra-
tion about domestic
matters that decisions
reached at college
levels can, in many
cases, be completely
ignored by the depart-
ments.
Of course, exactly
the same reasoning can
be applied to the stud-
ents' side. Policy de-
c i s i o n s made at
U.G.M.'s and council
meetings are\ of |;f'ttl;e
value unless they are
taken into the depart-
ments and discussed in
a departmental context.
Experience shows that
although a principle
may be accepted by
many departments,
each department applies
it in a different way—an
example being the prin-
ciple of c o n t i n u a l
assessment.
In order to have a~
well balanced cross-
section of opinion, staff-
student committees are
usually made up (of
several staff with vary-
ing positions) together
with the academic year
reps, the department
rep. and a representa-
tive from the U n i o n
Council. Quite clearly
the year reps, are the
" nitty gritty " of the
student representation
and in many cases the
success of the staff-
student committee de-
pends on the enthusi-
asm of the year reps. If
the year reps are in
contact with their year,,
then the staff-student
committee is a mean-
ingful institution a n d
not just tea and bis-
cuits with the head of
the department.
If anybody ever feels
strongly (which is
doubtful) about a matter
concerning himself or
his department (if
you're the other k i n d
read "her") then go
and tell your year rep.
—make sure that your
opinion is at least
heard (it may be the
only one). To quote a
famous American, " Do
it."
