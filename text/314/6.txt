of Curriculum Vitae
Service and W. R. Price,
M.A.
Looking for a job is a
job in itself. It should be
approached as a market-
ing operation with your-
self as the product. In any
marketing operation the
first step is to make the
product known to the
market — both that it
exists, and what it can do.
— in other words to ad-
vertise.
Your letter of applica-
tion and your Curriculum
Vitae are your self adver-
tisement. Their purpose is
to inform the prospective
employer of your existence
and your availability for
employment, and to set
forth sufficient of your
qualities and experience to
convince him that he
should investigate you
further by inviting you for
an interview. If you are in-
vited for an interview then
the first stage of your mar-
keting operation has been
successfully completed.
As with any marketing
operation you will start by
making a plan of com-
paign and budgeting for it.
First, decide how much
time you can spend on
your search. If you are
without employment, the
answer will be "at least 8
hours a day". Secondly,
decide how much money
you can spend. Remember
that however tight your
budget, the expenses of
job hunting must be given
a very high priority. They
will include telephone, pos-
tage, stationary, printing,
secretarial services (unless
you can use your wife!),
travel, entertainment, and
perhaps the expense of
staying away from home.
If you are without em-
ployment, time is of the
essence. Not only will you
find that the longer you
are out of a job the tight-
er will your budget be-
come, but you may also
find that prospective em-
ployers seem less interest-
ed in you. Several months
without employment may
be taken, rightly or
wrongly, to indicate that
you lack initiative.
If you are employed,
but looking for advance-
ment, budgeting for time
will be one of your main
problems. Your search
will involve considerable
reorganisation of your
life, especially to make
time for interviews, and
may even mean cutting
into your annual holiday.
The first time consum-
ing job is RESEARCH-
ING THE MARKET.
Read regularly the adver-
tisements. Make out a list'
of companies to approach
directly without- waiting
for them to advertise. Get
your name on the books
of as many Employment
agents and Management
Consultants as you can.
If you decide to ap-
proach a firm, ring it up,
find out its precise field
of activity and ask to be
sent any literature pertain-

and W. Price explain the technicalities of apply-
ing for a job.
ing to its activities. Above
all, find out the name of
the person who will read
your application, and ad-
dress your letter of appli-
cation to him personally.
The second time con-
suming job is AP-
PROACHING T H E
MARKET. You will need
to submit a Letter of Ap-
plication together with
your Curriculum Vitae.
Your Letter of
Application
This should be designed
to advertise you and your
suitability for the appoint-
ment for which you are
applying. It should contain
sufficient information
about you to make the ad-
vertiser want to know
more. Never allow it to
run to more than one
page. The detailed infor-
mation should be contain-
ed in your Curriculum
Vitae, which should be
attached to your letter.
Try to keep your letter
of application to three
basic paragraphs:
1. Say what position
you are applying for and
how you know it is vacant,
(i.e. "I am applying for
the position of Branch
Manager which was adver-
tised in the Daily Tele-
graph on September 7th").
or
("I have been advised to
write to you by Mr
who tells me that you will
shortly be looking for a
new Branch Manager")
or
("I am writing to you in
the hope that you may be
able to help me. I am
looking for a position as
Branch Manager to an es-
tablished firm, and hope
that this opportunity may
exist within your organisa-
tion")
2. This is the main para-
graph of your application.
It should be firm and to
the point, designed to
prove your suitability for
the position by way of
qualifications and exper-
ience, as well as demon-
strating your determina-
tion and confidence in
applying. Try to keep it to
two main points.
(i.e. "I have been em-
ployed as Manager of sev-
eral major organisations
over a period of x years,
and my background and
experience would appear
to match your require-
ments exactly.. ,")
or
("I took the opportunity
of telephoning your office

Plot?
Are the very roots of our society in dan-
ger of being eaten away by yet another
"communist" plot? According to Mrs. Mary
Whitehouse, the answer is yes. Mrs. White-
house was speaking at a General Studies
lecture last Tuesday entitled "The Assault
on Freedom". Mrs. Whitehouse, for those
who are not in the know, is the Secretary
of the National Viewers' and Listeners'
Association.
She would have us be- a supposed ability to un-
lieve that pornography is dermine our moral fibres,
an instrument of commun- The suggestion that por-
\t infiltration, because of nography is a "powerful
political weapon" was met
with hoots of derision
from an unusually large
audience — Mech Eng
220 was full to capacity.
Until this point, Mrs.
Whitehouse held the res-
pect of the audience with
a well-presented speech
which appeared accep-
table to the main body of
listeners. It was only when
confronted with such
amazing statistics as that
55 per cent of all rape
cases in the United States
of America are in some
way a direct result of por-
nography, and thus the
aforementioned commun-
ist plot, that her argu-
ments appeared to possess
a false basis.
However, even should
her hypothesis be proved
correct, we may all sleep
safely in our beds tonight.
The plot has, after all,
been now uncovered, and
we are all in the secure
and omnipresent hands
of our guardian angel and
Good Shepherd, Mary
Whitehouse.
your requirements, and my
experience and qualifica-
tions appear to fit very
well").
It is always a good idea
to make a telephone ap-
proach as well as writing a
letter, as this demonstrates
your initiative and deter-
mination. Wherever pos-
sible you should find out
the name of the advertiser
and address him person-
ally, and when you tele-
phone to do this always
leave a message to say who
has phoned and that you
will be writing. The
chances are that this mes-
sage will be passed on to
the man concerned, and
when he sees /our letter
of application he'll say to
himself "This is the fel-
low who went to the
trouble of telephoning
. . ." You are immediately
one up on other appli-
cants.
3. The final paragraph
should simply state that
your full details are con-
tained in your Curriculum
Vitae, which is attached,
and that you will be avail-
able for interview at a
mutually convenient time.
You should also state
when you will be available
•to take up the appoint-
ment. (This is a positive
statement which illustrates
your determination and
confidence).
Letters of application
may be typed or handwrit-
ten. The important point is
that they should be clear,
easy to read and impres-
sive. Use good quality
note paper, and make sure
that your signature is
legible. (If not print it out
underneath). Make sure
that your address and
telephone number are
clear.
Your Curriculum Vitae
A Curriculum Vitae
should be a clearly written
and well kid out summary
of your personal history
and experience. The pros-
pective employer, having
had his basic interest
aroused by your letter of
application, uses the Cur-
riculum Vitae to confirm
in his mind whether you
are in fact the type of em-
ployee he is looking for. It
should be concise and to
the point, and contain the
briefest possible details of
your background. As long
as your Curriculum Vitae
indicates your suitability
in the broadest terms, you
will have the opportunity
to elaborate at the inter-
view. Try and make the
prospective employer say
to himself "This man
looks interesting, I'd like
to know more about him".
Next week, we will be
telling you how to com-
pose and prepare your
Curriculum Vitae in detail.
It's importance warrants
