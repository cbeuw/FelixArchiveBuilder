CAR FROM THESE MEN?
or rather, would
you vote for them?
What do you think the President of Imperial
College Union does? "Who's he? " "A good
question" "We . . . ell, what's the union? " are
the usual replies.
This is made even more relevant by thej
imminent elections which are due on 23rd-*
24th October. The theory and reality differ'
from year to year making any positive defini-
tion difficult, but here goes.
The President is the
constitutional head of the
Union and as such is on
most of the sub-committees
in existence, including the
Board of Governors, where
he is assumed to speak for
the students. Traditionally
he is considered to be the
most politically minded of
the Union officials and is
therefore responsible for
introducing external poli-
tics into the student's diet.
As the constitution
stands he is, however sur-
prise, surprise) account-
able to the students in the
Union. He is obliged to
follow the wishes of any
Union meeting and if he
appears not to be doing so,
his resignation can be de-
manded.
The process of voting
one's rights away is inhe-
rent in a stable democracy
and I.C.U. is no excep-
tion. This means, there-
fore, that the job is much
more important than is
explicitly stated. The order
of discussion and the sub-
jects brought up at a
Union meeting invariably
originate from the Union
Executive of which Mister
President is the chairman.
Of course, this need not
be the case, but it needs
a good memory to re-
member the last time a
"non Exec, originated
motion" was passed at a
meeting.
If the Executive is suffi-
ciently trustworthy then
everything runs smoothly,
with the majority taking
the minimum amount of
effort necessary. There-
fore, the election of the
President determines how
little you have to do dur-
ing the coining year.
Now, if you are new to
the college you might be
wondering why we are
having any elections at all
this term. This has been
explained once or twice
before, but a potted ver-
sion is forthcoming any-
way.
The original President,
Chris Sheppard, duly
elected last term, resigned
over "an issue of prin-
ciple", leaving a slightly
chaotic mess. Ian Macken-
zie was appointed as act-
ing President until elec-
tions could be held.
Two candidates are
standing for the post, these
being Rob Armitage and
Adrian Smith. Rob Armi-
tage can be loosely classed
as belonging to the Union
Establishment. Last year
he performed as Rag
Chairman and is now Ex-
ternal Affairs Officer.
His opponent Adrian
Smith stood at the previous
election and tried hard,
though without much suc-
cess. Although it was not
generally known at the
time he was, and still is,
a member of Socialist
society, who have a repu-
tation for doggedness.
Unfortunately, t h i s
determination and con-
viction is hard to recon-
cile with the idea that the
President can be told what
to do. Just as an apoliti-
cal President does very
little, an actively radical
one does too much! The
hope always is that he
does not have too many
political convictions but
enough to cause some in-
terest.
Remember that you are
responsible for the choice
of the next President. You
can either indirectly affect
the result by not voting or
make the effort, just this
once. If the poll is less
than 25 per cent of the
student membership a re-
election must be held, and
nothing is more boring.
Under the present system
it is possible to register an
abstention and if these re-
sult in gaining half the
poll, the nominations are
opened for another ten
days. (See Union green
Blue Book).
Both candidates would
make good Presidents, but
in very different ways. If
you feel that revolutionary
change is due and you are
willing to support your
choice of candidate at
Union meetings, then vote
for Adrian Smith. If you
accept the system as it
stands, but like conscien-
tious leadership, then vote
for Rod Armitage.
The choice is yours!
REPRESENTATION
SCANDALS
REVEALED
"Student representation on the committees
and councils that make most of the decisions
relating to higher education is insufficient and
must be increased so as to give students equal
say" was the message of the one-day NUB
conference on Representation held at Birk-
beck College London on Saturday.
The conference opened
with a plenary session at-
tended by all of the hun-
dred or so delegates from
Universities, Polytechnics
and all other kinds of in-
stitutions of higher educa-
tion around the country.
The conference was ad-
dressed by Professor John
Griffith, the Chairman of
the Council of Academic
Freedom and Democracy,
Richard Briginshaw, the
General Secretary of
NATSOP, a printing
Union, and David Wynn of
the NUS Executive.
Professor Griffith re-
counted his personal ex-
periences as "Counsel for
the defence" in numerous
disciplinary cases in Uni-
versities. Towards the end
of his speech, he began to
recount his experiences of
and. recommendations on
Representation. He, in
c o m m o n with later
speakers, stressed the im-
portance of adopting the
correct tactics if students
are to go in for represen-
tation. The other members
of the committees would be
professional bureaucrats,
and unless the students sit-
ting on the committees
were equally professional
and did adequate back-up
work prior to the meeting
it would be useless their
attending. He pointed out
that the cards were
stacked against students
anyway.
Richard Briginshaw
was meant to be speaking
about "Democracy in In-
dustry" and how it related
to student problems, but
concentrated on the point
that Trades Unions were
very much dependent upon
and answerable to the law,
whereas Student Unions
are not. He made no refe-
rence to representation
until the end of his speech,
and then uttered only
guarded "solidarity with
the students" titbits. One
was left doubting even
more than ever before
whether the Trades Unions
had any sympathy what-
ever with students and
their cause. Perhaps the
only point he made on the
subject of representation
was that T U representa-
tives on management
committees in industry
have greater permanence
than student reps and thus
tend to get further in the
long run.
David Wynn for the
NUS Executive elaborated
on the history of repre-
sentation of students in
Britain. Demands by stu-
dents for representation
had been made as early
as 1820 in Scotland, and
the 1920's and 30's are
littered with examples of
such demands from all
round the country. The
NUS passed a resolution
on the subject in 1940 that
is hardly dissimilar from
those passed since the late
sixties. He explained that
NUS policy at the moment
is to campaign for one-
third staff, one-third stu-
dent and one-third outside
interests representation on
governing bodies and simi-
lar committees and 50/50
