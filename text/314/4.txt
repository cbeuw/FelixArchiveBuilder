EDITORIAL
It is Sunday afternoon. It is 5.45 pjn. I am sitting
at a typewriter. By precedent, I am now required to
write of the order of six hundred words entitled "Edi-
torial". But what about? There seems little point in
writing of the burning issue of the day (the forthcoming
presidential election, if you were not aware), since
there are already six hundred or so words on the sub-
ject on the front page.
Okay, let's write about Representation. Oh hang'
there are already 1100 words on that elsewhere in this
issue. What else is happening? Nothing?
Apathy. That's a good idea. I can write lots about
that. No I can't, I'm too apathetic.
You've heard it all before. Or rather, you've read
it in innumerable FELIX editorials about this time
of year every year since the world and I.C. Union be-
gan. The terrible thing is that things DO happen here.
Maybe they are not of world-shattering importance, but
events of interest occur every day in IC alone. Apathy
is, honestly, much less evident than is usually made out.
The problem is that of information. I have been
criticised over the last week or two for not reporting
many of the happenings in and around I.C. I am pre-
pared to take part of the blame, but most of it is, I
consider, unfair. So things DO go on in IC . . . but
who gets to know about them. Not FELIX, for one.
FELIX will print reports on just about anything. If
they're printable. But we have to know about them
first. If you're concerned, please tell us, so that we can
do something about it. It would be most unfortunate
if, come next Spring, the same criticisms of communi-
cation within the college are levied once again. The
media are now here. A weekly FELIX, more STOIC,
Even a regular weekly CEFE . . . but where's the
information to put into them?
Student news item of the week was obviously the
heckling of Her Majesty the Queen at Stirling Uni-
versity on Friday. This despicable act will certainly
not further the aims of students. Their objection to
the astronomic expenditure for the Queen's visit was
quite justified. All their actions did was to gain them
the major headline in every newspaper of any impor-
tance (with the notable exception of "Felix") and gang
public opinion against them. As they will have read in
Friday's "Evening Standard" survey of the "Men and
Women in the Street", their only support now comes
from 22-year-old punch card operators from Willesden.
It was doubtless as a result of this that they tendered
their apologies on Sunday to the Queen. This will not,
however, heal the wounds incurred by the British Pub-
lic. It may be many years before Universities are again
honoured by the presence of Her Majesty and pomp
and circumstance return to formal occasions in these
auspicious institutions of higher education.
REPRESENTATION
CONFERENCE
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Sir,—May I encourage
the Editor of Felix to
withhold from publica-
tion any letters not bear-
ing the identification of
their author.
It seems a pity that
what might easily be a
useful College publication
of high standing allows it-
self to be used as a shield
of anonymity by those
people who choose to
write derisive and deni-
grating letters, more often
than not ill-informed and
mildly libellous.
The refusal to publish
such letters would in no
way discourage those with
a valid point of view who
have the common courtesy
to put their name to their
opinions, while those who
seek to sneer and dispar-
age with the cowardly use
of esoteric pseudonyms
would be forced to seek
elsewhere a platform for
their dull wit.
I am dear sir yours
faithfully,
DAVID ROSSELL
Linstead Hall,
Prince's Gardens,
London SW7 1LU
Sir,—With reference to
the letter headed "Let us
pray" which appeared in
the current edition of
"Felix".
I wish to point out that
the implication that mem-
bers of the Linstead Hall
Bar Committee are given
"unconditional ^-admit-
tance" for services to the
Bar is false. It is at best
insulting, and at worst
libellous, to the Bar, Hall
and re-selection commit-
tees of 1971-2. and to the
Warden of the Hall, for it
implies that they were all
corrupt.
For my own case, for
your information, my ex-
tra years in Hall were
arranged by Dr. Grey of
the health centre. There is
only one other person on
my committee who is in
Hall for a third year, and
that is also on the recom-
mendation of Dr. Grey.
I am saddened by the
fact that the Editor of the
newspaper "Felix" should
allow members of his
editorial staff to produce
such wild accusations
without first ascertaining
the facts of the matter.
Trusting that you will
take such action as is
necessary, I remain Sir,
Yours faithfully,
A. R. TREASURE
Chairman, Linstead Hall
Bar Committee.
Sir,—I am amazed, flab-
bergasted, outraged, infuri-
ated, astounded, and
somewhat put out.
Reading "Felix" today
I come across an article
which I was pleased to
think was a precedent in
the turgid history of your
distinctly silly little paper.
Here was an article that
made sense. Sentences
with verbs constructed in-
to lucid paragraphs
formed an oasis, a veri-
table Eden in the barren
desert of Felix's literary
worth.
Perhaps, I thought, here
we were witnessing the
beginning of Felix's slow
crawl from the primeval
swamps of prehistoric
journalism.
But wait, the article is
familiar. Was there not
something similar in
Guildsheet on Monday?
In fact was there not
something E X A C T L Y the
same in Guildsheet? Sir,
there was!
I am amazed, flabber-
gasted, outraged, infuri-
ated (save us, Ed.), astoun-
ded and somewhat put
out.
"Chris",
Editor, "Guildsheet".
Editor's Comment: Pre-
sumably your amazement,
flabbergastment, outrage,
infuriation, astonishment
and somewhat put-outabil-
ity were caused by dis-
covering that you had
written something suffi-
ciently printable to publish
in this fine journal. Thank
you for your kind com-
ments about FELIX. Re-
mind me to write a letter
to Guildsheet some day.
By the way, if you had
read the credits box on
the back page, you would
have found that Guildsheet
had actually been credited
with the article I
Dear Sir,—It has come
to my notice that my
name has 'been advanced
as a candidate in the
forthcoming Presidential
election. I should like to
make it clear that I am
not, and never have been,
a candidate in the afore-
said election. I had no
knowledge of said nomina-
tion which I believe was
perpetrated in jest by a
person or persons un-
known. I regret that I did
not discover the hoax un-
til • last Friday morning
even although my name
had been on the papers
for some time.
Finally, I feel it neces-
sary to apologise for un-
wittingly misleading the
members of I.C.U., especi-
ally anyone who may in
all innocence have secon-
ded by nomination.
Yours,
JOHN A. D. HARDING

representation on staff /
student committees. He
argued that he considered
this now inadequate, and
hoped as a result of this
conference a debate would
be held at Margate con-
ference in late November
which would alter NUS
policy. "Representation"
often ended up as "consul-
tation", he pointed out,
and although this was a
step it was by no means
enough. Higher Education
institutions are oligarchian
heirarchies, he said, and
this must be changed.
Most of the questions
came from and were con-
cerned with universities
and polys where there is
always a degree of rep-
resentation and their
Unions want more. Mike
Baxter, formely of the
NUS Exec, brought the
conference back to earth
with an impassioned
speech, reminding dele-
gates that in the vast majo-
rity of small colleges there
is no representation at all,
and the Principal tends in
these cases to be com-
pletely dictatorial. He
pointed out that many of
the students in FE colleges
and Technical Colleges are
trades unionists, and that
large numbers of the
governors of these colleges
are also T U people. He
said that the TU governors
should be made to care
more about their fellow-
unionist students.
In the second session,
discussion groups were
formed from the various
factions represented, i.e.
Universities, Polys, Col-
leges of Education, F E
Colleges and minority
group colleges (e.g. Art
colleges). Views and ex-
periences were exchanged
by delegates under a dis-
cussion leader.
The discussion leader
for the Universities sector,
Jim Hancock, the Presi-
dent of The University of
Manchester Union, pro-
duced an excellent paper
detailing a review of stu-
dent representation since
1968. Very little was raised
by any of the speakers at
the conference that did not
appear on this brief but
very comprehensive docu-
ment. It pointed out the
pitfalls of representation,
such as the standing com-
mittees with no student
representation that tend to
get set up to take the real
decisions when students
are put on to a major
committee, and the fact
that students sitting on
committees tend to become
regarded as individuals
not as representatives of
the student body as a
whole. Many other points
were raised, and an an-
notated version of the
paper together with a brief
survey of representation in
Imperial College will be
published in the next issue
of FELIX.
At the final plenary ses-
sion, the conference was
addressed by Digby Jacks,
president of the NUS. H©
outlined seven major prob-
lems in dealing with rep-
resentation :
1. Students are almost
always outnumbered on
committees.
2. Administrations con-
sider that students are on
committees as individuals.
3. Student unions have
found that, two or three
years after getting on to
them, they are on the
wrong committees.
4. Student representa-
tives often have inferior
status to other members of
the committee.
5. Much of the matters
discussed are "confiden-
tial" and not open to dis-
cussion amongst students.
6. Students need to be
more professional and
better organised if they
are to be on committees.
7. There are often re-
served areas of business
which students are not
even allowed to observe
the discussion of.
Digby said that student
representation is not an
end in itself. It is about
democracy, and represen-
tatives must be both man-
datable by Union General
Meetings and accountable
to them. The fight for
representation, he holds, is
one of the greatest battles
that the NUS has to fight,
and one of the most im-
portant ways of democra-
tising higher education.
