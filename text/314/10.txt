r a t i o n on Sunday w i t h the i n t e n t i o n of making a f i l m to show on today's programme.
However, we understnad that they s t r u c k d i s a s t e r when, having,shot only one r e e l of
f i l m , they " l o s t " the demonstration. They must have been p r e t t y dazed, since the
FftLJX reporter saw them a r r i v e at the head of the I . C . procession at Hyde Park.
A l s o at the demo, one of one of the c o l l e g e Broadsheets* e d i t o r s took h i s
camera w i t h the i n t e n t i o n of p r i n t i n g some of the photos he took i n h i s organ.
However, on h i s r e t u r n , he found that he'd forgotten to remove the lens cap of h i s
camera!t See FELIX f o r the only comprehensive p i c t u r e coverage of the deiao.
