Mountaineering
Expeditions
Bolivia
Last summer, an eight-man expedition left
Imperial College to climb in the Andes in Bolivia.
Towards the end of the period spent climbing, two
members of the expedition were killed whilst attempt-
ing a new climb on the east face of Illampu. They
were Dave Steel, aged 24, who completed his degree
in Electrical Engineering last year, and Rog Scull,
also aged 24.
Dave was an active member of the College Moun-
taineering Club for several years, a rock climber of
exceptional ability, who had several notable first and
early ascents to his name, especially in the Avon
Gorge area; he was also an experienced mountaineer
with several successful Alpine seasons behind him.
Rog was not a member of the college, but had
been a close friend and usual climbing partner of
Dave's for many years, and was invited to take part
in the expedition for his ability and experience as a
mountaineer.
C l o g g i e s ?
The IC Lacrosse Club has only been playing three
seasons, but has already established a keen nucleus
of players. The club has regular Saturday matches in
the Southern Lacrosse League Third Division. Already
this season, the team has had a good start, winning
its first match .12-8, and last Saturday's closely fought
game against Marjons, 8-7 coming from behind in the
final moments with a two goal burst. Anyone inter-
ested in playing or wanting more details contact Paul
Spooner, Captain Physics II or !Bob .Strangeway Lin-

Caucasus
The IC Mountaineering Club sent an expedition to
the Caucasus this summer. Its plans were to spend some
six weeks climbing in the Caucasus mountains during
July and August, but after a short time in Russia, it
was realised that the local restrictions and controls
placed upon the party in the mountains would prevent
the-group from achieving any significant climbs what-
soever. After two weeks, the members of the expedition
decided to leave Russia and travel to the French Alps.
The group had been in Chamonix for about ten days
when the tragedy occurred.
On Saturday, 29th July,
Graham Groarke and
Keith Skelton left Chamo-
nix for the Argentierre
Hut about five miles up
the valley from Chamonix
They planned to do two
climbs from the hut, both
popular and well frequen-
ted routes. The first on the
Sunday was to be a route
known as the ENE but-
tress and NE slope of Les
Courtes, The second which
they intended to climb on
Monday was to have been
a. traverse of Le Tour Noir
They were expected back
at camp in Chamonix on
Monday evening.
They did not return on
Monday evening, but
those left in camp were
not unduly worried by
their non-appearance The
weather had become
cloudy during the after-
noon, and it was assumed
they were spending an-
other night in the hut and
would come down the fol-
lowing morning.
The alarm was raised at
2 p.m. on Tuesday after-
noon (1st August) when
they had not arrived. The
special high mountain
branch of the police were
notified. They telephoned
the warden of the Argen-
tierre hut, who said that
Groarke and Skelton had
left at 2 a.m. on Sunday
morning to climb Les
Courtes (3,800 m) and had
not returned to the hut.
The warden has assumed
they were going on down
the other side of the moun-
tain to a different hut, the
Couvercle, after complet-
ing their climb. He said
that a French party had
passed them about half
way up the climb and re-
ported that the two Eng-
lishmen were going well,
if a little slowly. The
French party who had not
seen them again after pas-
sing them completed the
climb and returned to the
Argentierre Hut.
The Warden of the Cou.
vercle Hut was then tele-
phoned, and said that he
had seen no sign of the
pair. Both Wardens re-
ported their areas in heavy
mist.
The police said that
they would send their heli-
copter to search as soon
as the mist cleared up a
little.
The helicopter went up
at first light on Wednes-
day morning. The bodies
of Graham and Keith
were found almost imme-
diately at the foot of the
ENE buttress of Les
Courtes, and were brought
down to Chamonix. It
was judged that the pair
had fallen a long way,
possibly from near the top
of the climb which was
1,800 feet from start to
finish. There was no ob-
vious reason as to the
cause of the accident.
Both Keith and Graham
were experienced climbers
and the route was well
within their capabilities. It
is felt that the most likely
explanation of the cause
of the accident is that the
pair had taken an unduly
long time on the early rock
section of the climb and
found themselves on the
upper snow field in the late
afternoon when the snow
was soft and unstable. It
is almost impossible to be-
lay or perform an ice axe
arrest in soft wet snow.
They would by then have
been quite tired and one
slip would have been en-
ough to pull both men
from the face.
Whatever happened, the
loss of two good friends
was a severe blow to the
expedition and the Moun-
taineering Club.
