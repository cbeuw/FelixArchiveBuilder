The West London World Wide Fund for
Nature Supporters' Group are holding their
annual sponsored walk along the Thames
embankment in mid-October.
We need people! Help register walkers,
sign post the route, sell refreshments, or best
of all, take part in the walk itself. In recent
years, this event has raised c£7K.
This year, we are focussing on protecting
vanishing species- and need to raise much-
needed funds to achieve this aim. Bring your
friends, the more the merrier!
Please call Jane on 0171 376 4328 for
more information.
