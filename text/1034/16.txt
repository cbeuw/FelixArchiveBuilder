IC Rugby Club Storm Canada
ith last year's tour of Zimbabwe having
proved such a success, IC Rugby
Football Club were itching to do some more
travelling. So, at the beginning of the spring
term, Canada was chosen as the destination
and preparations began. The result was a two
week tour which was to include five games of
rugby, an IC 'sports weekend' and two alum-
ni events.
Come the morning of Saturday 24th June
the months of anticipation were over and
ICRFC was off to Canada. Flying to
Vancouver on the west coast via Calgary,
gave us our first glimpses of the Rocky
Mountains. After collecting our transport
(four space cruiser vans) at the airport our
first port of call was the University of British
Columbia.
"the result was soon
forgotten, thanks to
hospitality of our hosts"
Following a morning training session to
run out the travel stiffness, the afternoon was
spent relaxing on the beach and playing touch
rugby in Stanley Park. Unfortunately, one or
two had a shade too much sun and regretted
it the next day in the game against Port
Alberni Black Sheep on Vancouver Island.
We lost the match against Black Sheep
narrowly, 14-10, but the result was soon for-
gotten thanks to hospitality of our hosts.
Alas, we had to wrench ourselves away from
the lakeside and contin-
ue on to Victoria, billet-
ing at U V I C . In
Victoria we came across
our next opponents in
the form of Velox
Rugby Club. A superb
display saw us achieve a
thoroughly deserved 24-
0 victory which was
ample reason for a night
of celebration.
Moving out of
Vancouver we had a
long day's drive before
arriving at Kelowna, the
venue of our next game
against the Black Crows. Sweltering heat and
a lacklustre first half display meant that we
were really up against it, but a strong second
half really earned us respect as well as points,
despite going down valiantly 29-17.
Our aim over the next two days was to
travel some 800kms to Calgary, through the
scenic Jasper and Banff Parks and to safely
navigate the rugged terrain of the Rocky
Mountains. Motel accommodation was
secured in Jasper, a town whose inhabitants
could quite easily have been the cast of
Northern Exposure.
Our entry into Calgary at night was her-
alded by a fearsome electrical storm accom-
panied by driving rain. A visit to Calgary's
Olympic sites was the first item on the agen-
da for the next day. The team experienced
the thrill of a bob sleigh run and ski jump
with out imperiling their lives - with the aid
of a simulator.
The Kannucks provided stern opposition
in the afternoon's match and we succumbed
28-17 to their superior strength. This was the
team's first opportunity to meet and thank
Mike Adams, an ex-ICRFC captain, who had
played an integral part in the organisation of
the tour. Saturday 8th July was an extrava-
ganza of sporting activity. We watched the
rowers pull their oars in the morning before
it was our turn to take on the might of the
Calgary Saints in the afternoon. After weath-
ering an early storm we fought back fero-
ciously and hung on to win 23-20 in a titanic
struggle played in the strength sapping heat.
A superb team effort coupled with supe-
rior fitness, ensured we finished the tour on a
playing high. Professor John Archer,
Imperial's Deputy Rector, addressed a gath-
ering of alumni in the club house and every-
body enjoyed both the after match feast as
well as the evening's entertainments.
Being all-round sportsmen, the final day's
"a town whose inhabitants
could quite easily have been
the cast of Northern
Exposure"
cricket match proved no problem as we tri-
umphed in a keenly fought 20 over contest
against the alumni in the scenic Riley park.
There was time afterwards for some final
pressie shopping or rodeo before departing
for the airport.
Taking off in the middle of an electrical
storm was a further memorable experience of
a wonderful tour which sadly had to end. It
was a very exhausted but cheerful party
which arrived back at Heathrow after an
unforgettable fortnight.
