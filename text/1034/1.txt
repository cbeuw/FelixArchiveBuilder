ICU's Last Days
in Beit Quad?
The Students' Union of Imperial
College now looks likely to
move from Beit Quad by 1998
as the estates department forges
ahead with controversial plans
for a massive overhaul of the
South Kensington campus.
Staff and students involved
with Imperial College Union
(ICU) are increasingly worried
at the rate at which the plans
appear to be proceeding without
thorough consultation. IC
estates plan to move the union
bars, offices and entertainments
facilities into the Sherfield
Building as part of an Â£100 mil-
lion scheme to revamp college.
The proposals have been
sparked off by the development
of the new Basic Medical and
Biological Sciences centre,
which will remove the biology
department from Beit Quad. IC
Director of Estates Ian Caldwell
and his team plan to convert
Beit into a prestigious "Oxford
Quad" residential area that
would generate valuable income
through conference bookings
during vacations.
I C U say they are being
increasingly sidelined in the
plans: the college building com-
mittee set up to oversee the
scheme has no student represen-
tatives. I C U President Sarah
White has continually called for
a wider debate on student facili-
ties but has waited over three
months with minimal response
to her letters to Caldwell. "I am
extremely cross," she said.
The architects Trout and
MacAslan have submitted a fea-
sibility study to IC estates, but
the plans have been dismissed as
being prohibitively expensive. It
seems they are now working to
produce blueprints for a less
expensive development. It is the
latest in a long line of feasibility
studies and 'masterplans' which
have been produced over the
last few years, but I C U staff are
unhappy that the proposals are

Royal College of Science Building Still Standing
IC Estates Projects' manager
Brian Dennis insists that that the
building of the Basic Medical
Sciences centre is still on target,
although permission to demolish
the old Chemistry building it will
replace has still not been granted.
Medical school representatives
continue to express their reserva-
tions about the lack of social and
catering facilities in the plans for
the new building. page 6
