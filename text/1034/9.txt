If you want a fun and challenging way to
spend your Wednesday afternoons, and are
interested in working with children then "The
Pimlico Connection" could be just what you
are looking for!
We have been sending students from
Imperial into local schools for the last twenty
years to assist with science, technology and
maths classes. Tutoring is very varied, and
certainly never boring! You may be involved
with teaching children from five to sixteen, as
part of the whole class with the teacher or in
small groups on your own.
The experience is rewarding, fun and
challenges and improves communication
skills. Try explaining concepts that you take
for granted, e.g. friction or pressure, in a way
which pupils, of say eight years old, could
relate to and understand.
It can be quite daunting the first time
that you go into the classroom, with thirty
faces staring at you inquisitively. However,
the children always make you very welcome.
Some tutors worry that they may not be
able to answer the questions that the children
ask, but the teachers are always present to
help. Pupils do have a way of asking difficult
questions that you can't or won't like to try
and answer. One afternoon a twelve year old
asked me out of the blue "How could the
Virgin Mary be a virgin if she had a baby?"
How do you begin to answer that one?
Tutors can act as role models to the
pupils that they teach. It hopefully presents
Higher Education as an option for their
future. Female tutors can also provide a posi-
tive image of women scientists and engineers.
As tutors we hope to dispel the myth that sci-
ence is difficult and boring.
The Pimlico Connection Society is run
by a student committee which also organises
open days and social events. If you are inter-
ested and want to find out more, come along
