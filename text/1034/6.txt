Imperial planners insist that they
can make the 1998 deadline for
the opening of the new Basic
Medical and Biological Sciences
building.
With the government share
of the funding only being finally
confirmed in July, IC has just
applied for planning permission
to build the centre.
According to a newly
revised schedule, the final design
stage of the project should be
completed by March, which will
leave just two years before the
projected completion date of
Easter 1998. Rodney Eastwood,
Director of Planning, insists that
the scheme is on target. "The
opening date of September 1998
cannot be moved. It's absolutely
fixed."
However, the Old Chem-
istry building due to be knocked
down to make way for the new
department is still standing.
Planners will submit applications
for demolition later this month,
which means that the building is
unlikely to come down until early
next year. Nick Black, Estates
Manager, said "It means we're
already running behind schedule,
which is really bad news."
The new building will even-
tually house St Mary's and
Charing Cross Hospital Medical
Schools, the National Heart and
Lung Institute and the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School as
well as Imperial College's own
biology department.
Student union officers from
St Mary's are concerned that
they are not represented at the
regular planning and design meet-
ings for the building. Sarah
White, Imperial College Union
President, represents all the dif-
ferent student groups involved.
In addition, Sarah Edwards,
St Mary's Union President, is
concerned that students will not
be allocated adequate social and
catering facilities. The present
outline design allows for only a
very small capacity restaurant on
the ground floor. M r Eastwood
emphasised that the new centre
will be only thirty yards away
from the Sherfield Building and
that the different groups of stu-
dents would mix better if they
shared the same social facilities.
Both the Reid and Pippard lecture theatres were completely refur-
bished this summer in preparation for the increased use that they
will receive this year. With the old chemistry building now out of
action and awaiting demolition, first and second year lectures have
had to be re-allocated elsewhere. Previously the only regular usage
of these lecture theatres was by the the biochemistry department.

New Health Centre Planned
Imperial College estates depart-
ment have commissioned a feasi-
bility study to refurbish and
expand the halls of residence in
Princes Gardens.
Options include building
new halls on the roof of the
sports centre and on the site of
the tennis courts beside
Linstead. The department also
plans to completely refurbish the
Southside building.
The move comes as part of a
plan to completely redevelop the
area. Funding has already been
confirmed to move the health
centre from its present location
to the Conference Office
premises at the east end of
Southside. This 3
A million pro-
ject is being financed by the
National Health Service and
Nick Black, Estates manager,
says that they anticipate getting
planning consent soon.
In a further development
over the summer, Imperial has
bought the area of park north of
Princes Gardens. Although they
are not allowed to build on the
land, estates plan to extend the
sports centre underground to
provide further facilities.
The sports centre itself was
designed to have a hall of resi-
dence built on top of it, but a
planning application submitted in
1988 was not accepted, and
attracted considerable opposition
from local residents.
Nonetheless, estates intend to
resubmit an application, with the
hope of building student flats. A
considerable increase in the num-
ber of bed spaces available is nec-
essary to accommodate the med-
ical students who will be based in
South Kensington from 1998.
Nick Black maintains that IC
is in a strong position to secure a
large loans at a favourable rate of
interest to finance the proposals.
Each bed in an IC hall of resi-
dence brings in around £2000 a
year from conference bookings,
so the new halls could effectively
finance themselves, he insisted.
He maintained that' college
would endeavour to keep rents
around the £50 a week mark.
