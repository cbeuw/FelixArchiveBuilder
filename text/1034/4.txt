The Union of the University of London: U L U President, Ghassan Karian (left), and Imperial College
Union President, Sarah White, take a break from discussing future student funding policies.
The death of a Linstead fresher
was narrowly averted at the end
of last term when people stand-
ing on the ground below man-
aged to avert a suicide attempt.
Both the student's depart-
ment and hall of residence wel-
fare provisions have been called
into question, since it was wide-
ly known that the first year was
unhappy and having problems.
The incident occurred on
the last Friday of the Summer
term. Although Linstead's
Warden did have some success
in calming the student as he was
perched on his window sill,
the situation was apparently
brought to a head when the
police and fire authorities
entered Watts Way with their
sirens blazing.
It was only thanks to one of
his friends managing to stop his
head hitting the concrete below
that the Mechanical Engineering
student avoided more serious
injuries than a broken pelvis.
The fresher involved is
known to have been drinking in
the Da Vinci's bar earlier that
evening where he had exhibited
signs of distress. His outburst in
the Union was dealt with by
staff who treated a minor cut to
his head. He was left with
friends to be comforted, but
soon ran off to Linstead.
With the pressure of exams
and the volume of work given to
students being a contributory
factor, this incident once again
questions the pressure levels
exerted by Imperial's various
departments.
â€¢ Another serious incident took
place on the final night of the
Summer term. A guest of an
Imperial College student
allegedly punched one of a group
of rugby club friends. An affray
resulted, in which blood was
spilt, and claims were made that
'the Army of Jah' would be
involved in retribution.
Imperial College Union (ICU)
President, Sarah White, is taking
part in a new initiative to over-
turn a key policy of the National
Union of Students (NUS).
Ghassan Karian, the
University of London and former
Kings' College Union President is
spearheading a campaign to come
up with new ideas for higher edu-
cation funding. The media
friendly Labour Councillor from
Essex hopes to succeed where he
failed last year in the NUS
Extraordinary General Meeting
which was held in Derby.
That meeting narrowly rejec-
ted a motion to reverse the long
standing policy, which calls for
grants to be restored to 1979 lev-
els. But Ghassan denies that this
'New Solutions' campaign is sim-
ply a rerun of the previous battle.
He insists that there will be spin
offs, for a 'whole range of educa-
tional issues'.
The ULU President believes
that the proposed change will
benefit students as the NUS
would, without their unrealistic
policy, be involved at the highest
level of the educational debate.
When pressed on this matter, he
insisted that Eric Forth, the
Government's Higher Education
Minister, was sympathetic to the
campaign.
According to Mr Karian, the
current policy is completely
impractical and does absolutely
nothing for students. It is 'pie in
the sky', where as he wants to see
'food on the plate', metaphorical-
ly speaking.
With a steady build up from
a discussion document through a
draft policy paper to a final poli-
cy document, Ghassan insists
that he is looking for a calm and
rational debate. According to him
the Derby Meeting was marred
by heated arguments which over-
shadowed any rational discussion.
His current calls for a
debate of the issues rather than
an emotional crusade runs some-
what counter the latest 'New
Solutions' statements. They add
to the charged atmosphere by
forcefully attacking the NUS for
their present policy.
They accuse the traditional
movement of being dominated
by 'extremist leftwing groups'
who 'stifle the debate on educa-
tion funding'. New Solutions'
papers further attack the NUS'
campaign for demonstrations and
occupations with highly pejora-
tive language.
Mr Karian, with his well doc-
umented 'New Labour' links,
denied that the matter was a
party political issue. He insists
that he is ready to work with all
political parties on the future of
education funding. With most of
the main political parties about to
commence their own policy
reviews, the withdrawal of the
NUS policy is seen as essential.
The ICU President insists
that she is only attending in a
personal capacity; she asserts that
she will pay any affiliation fees
herself. Sarah emphasises that
she would have to be 'utterly
convinced' that the proposed
New Solutions are going to work
before proposing that ICU as a
whole should affiliate.
Having the President of such
an NUS sceptical college as
Imperial involved is being seen as
a coup for Mr Karian. He insists
that colleges like IC should be
part of the debate as their stu-
dents are just as affected by hard-
ship as any others. He hopes to
get Student Union officials from
Glasgow and Edinburgh
Universities - both non NUS
institutions - involved.
The present collection of
over 100 student union officials
from colleges as disparate as
London, Scotland and Wales
hope to eventually overcome the
45 - 55% defeat at the last NUS
conference and create a policy
more in tune with reality.
