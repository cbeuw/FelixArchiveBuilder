TWO . FELIX SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 30TH 1 9 9 5 NEWS
Last minute touches: ICU Entertainments Manager Mark Home
finished re-decorating the Ents lounge yesterday in preparation for
Freshers' Week. Over the next few days eight bands, a hypnotist and
a top TV comedy act will be appearing at six events. "It's our first
chance of the year to prove that not all three years at IC are about
engineering," he said.

not considering the simpler and
much cheaper option of expand-
ing and refurbishing the union in
it's present Beit position. When
the biology department moves in
1998, ICU could expand into the
empty space relatively easily,
whilst still leaving room for con-
siderable expansion of the resi-
dential area.
Ian Caldwell was on leave as
Felix went to press, but Nick
Black, Estates Manager, insisted
that ICU would not be pushed
into a scheme that they weren't
happy with. "The Rector told
Lucy [last year's ICU President]
that he would make the new
union building an offer too good
to refuse... as I understand it,
that situation remains," he said.
Black also dismissed out of
hand rumours that a dramatically
shortened timescale was being
pushed ahead. There had been
suggestions that the Union could
be asked to vacate its present
premises for temporary accom-
modation as soon as next sum-
mer. "Nothing is settled at all,"
he insisted.
Sarah White insists that she
would strongly oppose a move
based on the current plans. She
guaranteed that Imperial's stu-
dents will be fully consulted
before a final decision is made.
She emphasised: 'There will
absolutely definitely be a refer-
endum' on the subject, insisting
that this is not a decision that any
one person could take.
ICU employees appear simi-
larly resolute in their opposition
to any forced removal from their
present location. One senior offi-
cial suggested that there would
be sit in of staff if any pressure
was brought to bear on them to
vacate the much loved Quad.
Nick Black insisted that any
hesitancy in fully disclosing the
estates department's plans was
because they wanted to get the
proposal 'just right' before it was
finally presented to the student
body. He said that they were
aware that it was likely to be a
contentious issue, and wanted to
make sure that everybody con-
cerned would 'get a good deal'
before the plans were fully
brought out in the open.
News in brief
Clayponds Crime Wave
Residents of Clayponds,
Imperial's Ealing accommodation
estate, are expressing increasing
concern about the recent spate of
burglaries. The complex has been
broken into eleven times in
recent months, with one female
ground floor resident being a vic-
tim three times. Matt Crompton
ICU Deputy President (Finance
and Services) said that there was
a programme under way to
review Clayponds security.
"They will almost definitely be
having passive IR detectors
installed," he insisted. "We're
deeply concerned and will be
pushing it through the appropri-
ate channels," he said
Biochem Honour
Professor J. Oliver Dolly,
Professor of Molecular Neur-
obiology in the Department of
Biochemistry, has been awarded
the Henderson Medal by the
Centre for Applied Microbiology
and Research.
This prestigious award fol-
lows his Henderson Memorial
Lecture at the Centre late last
year. Past recipients of the
award, which is always given to
those who have carried out emi-
nent work in the Centre's field,
include Sir Hans Kornberg and
Prof Luc Montagnier.
Barrier Breakdown
The effectiveness of the Closed
Circuit Television Camera net-
work, which extends throughout
the Imperial College campus, has
been called into question by
repeated acts of vandalism over
the Summer.
The parking barrier in Watts
Way, which has its own dedicat-
ed camera, was ripped off just
yards from the Southside
Security Lodge.
Apparently with so many
different cameras in the Princes'
Gardens area - over ten at the
last count, it is, not possible to
monitor all of them at the one
time.
Consoc Capers
Imperial College's Conser-
vative Society have started off
the year in much the same way as
they finished the last, by causing
controversy with their web
pages. Not content with be cen-
sored twice in the final term,
they once again look set to pro-
voke the wrath of Imperial
College Union with a defamatory
attack on a well know public fig-
ure.
This time the subject of
their 'Off the Record' column is
the media, and in particular the
well worn idea of how the media
monitor politicians and their
activities, but how nobody regu-
lates the journalists. Consoc go
so far as naming Rupert
Murdoch, the owner of the News
International conglomeration, as
one who wields too much power.
Their have been no reports so far
of legal action against either
Imperial College Union or the
Conservative Society in particu-
Aero Manoeuvres
The outbreak of building projects
which erupted across the college
campus during the Summer
Vacation has included the rede-
velopment of the Aeronautics
Department's Prince Consort
Road entrance. This high cost
scheme involved transforming
the previously dingy front into a
brightly lit display reminiscent of
the Science Museum's Flight
Lab.
The decor, which strongly
features imitation rivets, is being
questioned as a waste of College
money. The reason for the con-
cern centres on the fact that the
door is only open for ten hours a
day between 8am and 6pm. The
lack of security camera means
that the swipe reader allows
access only to security personnel
in times of emergency, and
forces Aeronautics students who
want to enter after hours to trek
round through Chemical
Engineering.
