Hello.
It's a brand new year, and the
start of a new run of Felix issues.
Hope you like our first edition.
Fear and
loathing in SW7
The year doesn't seem to have
got off to a very good start.
While the union staff have been
working ridiculous hours in order
to ensure that everything is in
order for the start of the new
academic year, the union itself is
in a precarious position.
The vast majority of the
freshers week events will be tak-
ing place in the Union and Beit
Quad, yet nobody knows for
how much longer. The break-
down in communication is some-
thing which never should have
been allowed to happen. The
whole air of private meetings and
closed door subcommittees has
created an air of secrecy that
does nothing but perpetuate the
idea that student needs take sec-
ond place to those of conference
centre guests.
I am perfectly prepared to
believe that a new, purpose-built
union could indeed be a
favourable alternative, but the
whole manner in which the cur-
rent dealings are being run will
simply make everyone suspi-
cious, defensive and intransigent.
Too much beer
Looking through the second sec-
tion, it's hard to avoid the strong
correlation between Freshers'
Week and the consumption of
vast amounts of alcohol. Perhaps
this isn't something we should be
:. • •.••.!!.
particularly proud, of. Especially
in a week when Time Out quotes
Imperial as an establishment of
top over indulgers.
Right to reply
Don't think that reading this
magazine need be your last
involvement with Felix. The easy
way to comment, question or
generally abuse us for whatever
you may find offensive is the let-
ters page. Find us in the North-
West corner of Beit Quad - bring
your Union Card along to prove
that you're at least connected
with IC!
THIS ISSUE WAS PREPARED WITH THE CONSIDERABLE EXPERTISE OF
JEREMY, MARK BAKER, JON JORDAN AND TED W.
THANKS OWAIN.
