R C S : " W e ' r e s t i l l o n t h e h u n t . . . i t ' s n o t a l l o v e r y e t "
The troubled relations between
the Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) and Kings'
College London Union (KCLSU)
look set to continue. Many mem-
bers of the RCS exec say they are
angry that the Kings mascot
stolen in a 'rag raid' has been
returned without the customary
mascotry penance of a sizeable
donation to charity.
The return of the 6001b lion
was negotiated by I C U President
Sarah White and RCS President
Mo Dulloo when Kings College
repeatedly resisted demands call-
ing for a ransom. M o said "I can't
say I'm very happy with the situ-
ation but there didn't seem to be
any point in letting it drag on any
longer."
Members of the RCS lifted
"Reggie" the lion in an audacious
attack on the Kings' Kensington
premises last December. They
managed to persuade security
staff that they were taking it
away to be cleaned, and demand-
ed that Kings donate 100 pints of
blood for its return.
The strained relations
between IC and Kings' were
compounded when fourteen
Kings' students attacked ICU's
traditional bar in January. They
attempted to steal some of the
valuable pewter tankards from
behind the bar counter to bargain
with, but in the ensuing fracas
managed to do £2000 of damage
to the ancient Beit Quad doors.
The University of London Union
President Ghassan Karian, then
President of K C L S U , was impli-
cated in the cover-up of the Kings
Union involvement in the affair.
Rob Hall, the new President
of K C L S U , is anxious to repair
the strained relations between
the two colleges. He is clearly
delighted to have the mascot
back. Made of cement, copper
and bits of old vacuum cleaner
and painted gloss red, the lion is
apparently of great sentimental
value to the students' union.
"Words can't express how happy
we are to have him back," he
said.
With the return of the lion
being negotiated over the sum-
mer vacation, most of the RCS
exec did not know that it was
going back. Richard Willis, Rag
Chair, was angry and defiant:
"We need some compensation
for this. It's a bloody disgrace."
He warned K C L S U that as far as
he was concerned, the score was
still not settled. "They've got to
do something for charity and
they've got to do it quick... It's
not all over yet, but I suppose we
can finish it at a later stage."
Speaking to Felix, Willis rejected
the suggestion that the sport of
mascotry was sad, pointless and
clearly destructive. "Mascotry
promotes lateral thinking and ini-
tiative amongst students," he
claimed.
Rob Hall insisted that
K C L S U "have withdrawn from
mascotry for the time being." He
explained that they are now plan-
ning to have the lion restored as
part of a venture that will also see
the sculpting of a bust of
Desmond Tutu for the Kings
Union bar. "We're hoping for a
clean, calm run into his restora-
tion," he said.
