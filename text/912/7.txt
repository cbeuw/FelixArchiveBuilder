becomes apparent that this is, in
fact, 'goff', though any such
compilation that does not feature
Pil's Rise, Joy Division's

from tunnel vision.
So, with blinkers removed, I
remove the sleeve. The Cure's

awful lot of stuff resembling demo

little-known music that W e are, it's
still odd. This is not a gripe. I mean,
some are good, some are downright
bloody awful. Only one, this one,
is fucking astonishing.

this was as commercial as sex back
in '85, the last days, but it still
remains a finely- crafted testament

One is forced to consider genius a

nasty, and must surely inaugurate
him as the King of Melancholia and

one of the greatest pop songs of the
eighties, Echo and the Bunnymen's
The Cutter-a steaming tune from a
band who never dropped their ' H ' s
or their ' T ' s and were still one o f
the coolest ever. This is followed
by Siouxsie's frantic Hitchcock
pastiche, Spellbound. Great stuff.
Shortly after, our attention is
dragged by the stupidly O T T Ziggy
Stardust, to consider Bauhaus. This
homage to His Davidness is one of
few really entertaining pieces
produced by Murphy, A s h and C o . ,
or as I prefer, 'Duran Duran from
H e l l ' . I'm glad they're not around
anymore - their outdated, pompous
histrionics and embarrassingly
'arty' posturing are as dead as,
well, Bela Lugosi. After this the
Mary Chain's brilliant Some Candy
Talking is, oddly enough, like a
breath of fresh air.
A n d onto A. A.E.. O r rather, not.
A better Stranglers song wouldn't
go amiss either, but Depeche Mode
have never been as good as on
Enjoy the Silence. A s for the rest,
the Neffs are great fun, as are the
Creatures, the Damned and
N.M.A., but I'm getting tired of
writing this. Sadly, the appearance
o f the Psychedelic Furs does
nothing to dispel the (con)fusion of
feverish, incisive pop, and bloated
stadium rock. Alice's House or
President Gas would've been better.
Some o f these were/still are great
bands, but this representation of
post-punk rock music seems too
often to contradict it's o w n
principles. A n y self-respecting goth
(I know that verges on the self-
contradictory) will already own
most of these, so who is this aimed
at? the new kids on the pop scene?
liberated metalheads? free-to-rock
yuppies? Tell you what; Y o u

O f the songs themselves, only Big
Hopes falls short of the mark, but
that's only because it follows the
extraordinary Civil Kong Smasher-
it would make Love Will Tear Us

Snow is a staggering, loosely-
hinged build-up to a tumultuous
bastard child of the Birthday Party
- a wash of discordant keyboard
does nothing to dispel my unease.

-Town and
Country Club.
Kentish Town,
I'd love to rave about the whole gig
as perhaps anyone would who sees
one of their favourite bands. The
bands were excellent, the sound was
excellent, and the draw was
excellent. I do, however, feel
obliged to slag off the vast numbers
of stage divers. What used to be an
art form indulged in by the few and
brave with a finesse that was
astounding has now become de
rigeur- it seems no gig experience
is complete without stumbling onto
the stage and falling off again. N o
more a buzz but merely a ritual; it's
just not good enough...
T o be honest, I can't even
remember the first band's name, let
alone what they sounded like, but
the listed support band—The Boo
Radieys—were good. Their version
of the n o w - s o m e w h a t - c l i c h e ' d
fuzzy indie guitar dance music (so
excellently played by My Bloody
Valentine and, more obviously;
Ride) was good, though somewhat
monotonous. They were lost in an
audience who failed to offer any
more support than a few head-
tossing moptops. M a y b e they were
shot in the back by Impending
Greatness?...
Now. N o w is the time to start
spouting a load of wank about how
fucking excellent Dinosaur were,
and it would probably be the truth,
but finally the point of the evening
became apparent. Despite J ' s
legendary apathy, Dinosaur Jr. have
produced four of the most original
albums I've ever heard, and they
played all the noise ones tonight.
F r o m You 're Living All Over Me
to Green Mind, it was all there, and
we lapped it up like a dog at it's
own vomit. J Mascis dives around
the stage like some headless chicken
on acid that believes the only route
to sexual gratification is via a guitar.
Everything about the spectacle was
over the top. Embellished with that
extra guitar freakout, almost to the
point of glam rock (but not quite),
perhaps the only complaint is that
the tunes are as catchy as shit on a
shoe; they rattle around in your
head forever and any amount of
rolling around on the grass won't
get rid of 'em. But, after all, that's
the point.
