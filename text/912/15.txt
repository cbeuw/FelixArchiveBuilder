Should we employ you if
you always say^s'?
•Yes • N o
There's no point i n recruiting some-
one just to agree with y o u .
But there is a sense in which we are
looking for m e n and w o m e n w h o are
positive thinkers. In other words, yes-
people, rather than bureaucrats.
People w h o believe that anything
is possible, and w h o can come u p with
new ideas and solutions..
Where a yes-person sees challenges,
a bureaucrat only sees problems.
A yes-person knows that a mistake
can often be turned into an advantage
later o n .
Others try only to avoid m a k i n g
mistakes in the first place, k n o w i n g
that new ideas always carry risks a n d
so the safest answer for them to give is
generally no.
O f course the world needs both
sorts of people.
But o u r kind of yes-people are
rare. If they weren't, we wouldn't be
r u n n i n g this ad.
O f course this is the answer we're
l o o k i n g for. In fact, it's so obviously
the answer we're l o o k i n g for, only a
yes-person w o u l d tick it.
M a y b e there is something wrong
with the question because it puts y o u
in a n o - w i n dilemma.
If you've spotted that, then you're
definitely the k i n d of person we're
l o o k i n g for.
Because w o r k i n g for B P involves
m a k i n g decisions where easy answers
are few and far between.
H o w do y o u assess projects that only
come to fruition i n the distant future?
Is it better to back the strategy that
pays £10 million over 9 years or the one
that will pay £2 million over 3 years?
But before y o u make decisions like
that we will have to make an important
one about you.
W e can't promise that the answer
will be yes. B u t if y o u don't apply y o u
can be sure that it will be no.
For all our tomorrows. For all our tomorrows.
