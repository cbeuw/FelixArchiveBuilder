It will be much cheaper and better
for both the environment and you.
Although a larger number than
those allocated did deserve permits
only a limited number were
available so they were allocated to
those who would suffer most from
being unable to drive in. I a m not
will to enter into any discussion
regarding these allocations as it is
a waste o f both my time and yours.

All permits have now been allocted
so there is no opportunity for
appeal. F o r information, for
females who are worried about
walking home at night, scream
alarms are avialable from the Union
Office. Those who applied and are
in easy cycling distance from
college were not allocated a
space... sell your car and buy a bike!
