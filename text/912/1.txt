he had been approached by a

police.

police in the U n i o n Office and was
found to be clean. H e later denied
that he had offered drugs and said
that 'it was a joke'. He told Felix
that the Police 'found nothing - I
wasn't perturbed about it in the
slightest'. The student who believed
he was b e i n g offered drugs
complained that he was being
harassed by the alleged drug seller
for the rest of the evening.

further drug incident is reported the
police will be called immediately.

drugs 'will not be tolerated'.
