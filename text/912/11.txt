Freshers' Tournament 1991 Flash
Gordon
T h e traditional curtain raiser to the
Imperial College Snooker season
was held last Sunday. The annual
Freshers Tournament provided a
showcase for new snooker talent at
Imperial. This years finalists had to
come through a field o f 28 starters
and a marathon five and a half hours
of snooker.
The first semi-final match was
between Simon Bough (Chemistry)
and Robert Trosino (Maths). Both
players reached the semi-finals after
comfortable wins in the earlier
rounds. In a best o f three frame
semi-final, Robert beat Simon two
frames to nil, in 2 close fought
games. T h e second semi-final was
b e t w e e n A m i n u r R a h m a n
(Chemistry) and M i k e Spence
( M a t h s ) . A m i n u r made t w o
successful come backs to win on the
pink and black respectively, beating
M i k e two frames to nil.
After his defeat, M i k e Spence
commented that A m i n u r was " a
bloody good player'' and went on
to predict that he would w i n the
tournament. A n d so it was that
Aminur Rahman went on to win the
tournament without dropping a
frame, thus collecting the £15 first
prize. T h e loudest cheer o f the
afternoon went to the only female
competitor, Helen James, after
defeating her first round opponent.
But she narrowly failed to reach the
quarter finals, after a gallant effort
in her second round match.
Several competitors were heard
to c o m m e n t o n the pleasant
atmosphere o f the Snooker C l u b ,
located on the top floor of the Union
building, and how very reasonable
the £5 membership was for the use
of four full size tables for the whole
y e a r . S o n o w the F r e s h e r s
tournament has ended, preparations
are a foot for this years November
Open Snooker Championships. So
if you still haven't joined the club
and want to, then come along to the
club during any lunch time.
