ICU Career's Fair 1991
On the Queen's Lawn, next Tuesday and Wednesday.
By Monday, all things going to
plan, there will be a large marquee
covering two thirds of the Queen's
lawn: the venue for this year's
Imperial College U n i o n Career's
Fair. O n Tuesday, at 9.30am, the
doors open giving you the best
opportunity for finding yourself a
job after you have graduated. A
wide range of employers are again
attending this year, with companies
from backgrounds of Accountancy,
Engineering, Scientific Research,
O i l , B a n k i n g , C o m p u t e r
S o f t w a r e . . .and others. T h e
employers are here not to interview
you, but for you to interview them.
They will not be making any
judgement upon you, but are here
for you to decide which career
would best suit you. O r maybe you
have already made up your mind as
to the field of work you wish to go
into, but have yet to decide upon a
company.
The fair is open on both Tuesday
and Wednesday of next week and
is worth attending on both days, as
some companies are only coming
for one day. A full list of companies
on each day is listed below. Most
o f the c o m p a n i e s w i l l have
brochures and application form at
there stands; these can be taken
away and read at length afterwards.
A list of deadlines for application
forms can be obtained from the
careers centre office, room 310
Sherfield building. There will be a
careers centre stand at the entrance
of the marquee - see plan opposite.
Someone will help you here if you
have any general questions as to
what to do at the fair.
The fair is not only open to
students graduating this year. A n y
student, whether it be just for
interest or looking for a Summer
vacation job, is very welcome. It is
in your interest to make the most of
this opportunity especially given the
current climate where for the first
t i m e , graduates are h a v i n g
difficulties in going straight into a
career.
