Boycott Sports Centre
Revolting Squashed
Fiction
Dear Editor,
Regarding article in Freshers'
Felix entitled 'Imperial R a c i s m ' :
I am inclined to agree with the
Rector Sir Eric A s h et al that
'Academics for Free Speech' is not
a group actually based at Imperial
but rather a front for nasty,
cowardly racists using our college
because of its prestigious reputation
to add credence to their incredulous
'scientific' report.
I shall not waste space and time
proving the holocaust happened, six
million men, women and children
can't just disappear, not to mention
the film-footage and the records of
the E i c h m a n n trial (Eichmann
himself—may his name be blotted
out)—never denied the existence of
the Final Solution) and numerous
other pieces of irrefutable evidence.
Thank G o d the N U S and others
were able to force the Home Office
to ban Leuchter from entering
Britain. True, free speech is a basic
democratic right but nobody should
be given a platform to stir up racial
hatred.
M a n y members of the Jewish
Society lost grandparents and other
f a m i l y m e m b e r s in the gas
c h a m b e r s o f A u s c h w i t z and
Majdanek.
It is important for all decent
people to prevent history from
being re-written lest what has
happened once be allowed to
happen again.
If there are any I m p e r i a l
academics out there publishing such
revolting fiction, please reveal
yourselves so we can re-educate
you, or at least call on all students
to boycott your lectures.
Yours,
Michael Factor, Acting
Chairman Jewish Society.
Dear Editor,
I read with interest the letter by
John M c M a h o n M o o r e in last
week's Felix 910 on the subject of
the sports centre. A s captain of the
Imperial College squash club I
speak for the rest of the committee
and the club in endorsing every
point of M r M c M a h o n M o o r e ' s
letter. I enclose a letter sent to every
member of the South Kensington
Sports Committee by the Squash
C l u b committee on 13 September
1991 voicing our concerns:
As concerned students of Imperial
College we should like to bring to
your attention several points arising
from the recent, and the proposed
changes to the Sports Centre.
Although we are all members of the
Squash Club Committee, and have
a vested interest in the squash
courts, we believe our concerns to
be relevant to all student users of
the Sports Centre. We would
welcome your consideration and
comments on the following:
1. Are all die recent and the planned
changes in the best interest of
Imperial College students and staff,
for whom, after all, the Sports
Centre was originally intended? It
seems increasingly that non-college
members are being welcomed and
although their season
ticket/membership costs are
somewhat greater, they do not
appear to reflect the sort of expense
that would be involved for these
people to join a private health club
which would be their alternative.
We have no objections to private
members (except that they crowd
facilities intended for students) but
believe their payments should be
employed to subsidise student use;
in this way we feel that the recent
50% increase for a student season
ticket (now for only nine months,
as opposed to twelve!) could surely
have been avoided. It also seems
that private members pay little,
particularly compared to staff, for
example anyone off the street (or
from a local mansion) pays only lOp
more for a game of squash than
someone who works at Imperial
College. We are very concerned
that the running of the sports centre
is being moved towards a private
venture, rather than a college
facility.
2. Although our sports centre is not
luxurious, students are more
interested in clean, functional
facilities, than saunas and
solariums, even though these may
attract more private members. We
do not believe that our students
would ever use a cafe/bar when
popular subsidised facilities are
available across the gardens.
3. Charging for courts that are
specifically set aside for Squash
Club members' use seems like a
move aimed directly at eliminating
any need or desire for the student
to join the Squash Club. We
strongly argue against the
introduction of charges (£1 for half
an hour has been proposed). For a
club member to play just once a
week will now cost approx. £40
over the year (compared to only £5
Squash Club membership last year).
We also fear that the membership
of the largest ACC club will
diminish and the club performance,
which has been excellent in both
University League and UAU events
(last year the ladies won the London
League and won through to the
quarter finals of the UAU), will
suffer. The college's sporting
reputation will also suffer as a
consequence.
4. Last year's squash club captain
specifically requested to be included
in SKSC meetings but was never
informed as to when they took
place. Now, more than ever, more
student voice on this committee
seems an increasingly important
necessity. Can this be guaranteed in
the future?
We would greatly appreciate a
response on these matter. Thank
you for your consideration.
Yours,
Squash Club Committee.
W e have had two replies so far, one
in support of our case and one from
P. E . M e e claiming 'it had nothing
to do with h i m ' even though he sits
on the S o u t h K e n Sports
Committee!
W e feel that it is time for the
people of IC to make a stand to save
our sports centre from what looks
like impending privatisation. There
is enough incentive to stop sport at
IC with heavy workloads without
adding a financial burden to it as
well.
Yours faithfully,
C Robinson (for Squash
Committee).
