Historical Fact or Fiction
Is there room at Imperial College
for such sentimental drivel as
religion? Here, at one of the world's
finest institutions o f scientific
i n q u i r y a n d t e c h n o l o g i c a l
development (superior in most
respects to Cambridge, as we all
know), is there a place, ought there
be a place, for such unscientific
nonsense as Christianity?
Well is there room in Imperial for
Julius Caesar? (That depends - how
did he do in his A-levels?) Y o u
cannot prove by any 'scientific
method' that Julius Caesar actually
ever existed. Y o u cannot do an
experiment to demonstrate the
validity o f the theory that Julius
Caesar was.Nor can you formulate
an equation that will yield the
inevitable result: 'Julius Caesar'.
T h e issue o f Julius Caesar's
existance is an historical one, and
h i s t o r i c a l q u e s t i o n s are not
susceptible to scientific methods.
T h e issue o f the truth o f
Christianity is an historical one. It
is an issue of whether there is a
personal G o d who spoke and acted
decisively through a man, Jesus
Christ, and speaks and acts through
him even now. T h e historical
evidence that Jesus existed is far
weightier, according to objective,
commonly accepted criteria, than
the evidence that Julius Caesar
existed. T h e contention that Jesus
was more than a great man is also
well supported by solid historical
arguments.
Beyond the historical issue,
however, is an existential one. That
is the issue of what sense, if any,
to make of this life and how to live
it. S c i e n t i f i c r e s e a r c h a n a
mathematical calculations will
never tell you whether there is such
a thing as i o v e ' , or goodness, or
meaning in this activity we call
'life'.
Yet, much of what we know from
science speaks o f G o d , that there is
a Creator behind the intricate design
of nature.We've all known the
'teleological impulse' that entices us
to say that plants 'want' to get at
light, or water 'tries' to stay
together. T h e most r i g o r o u s
scientific training doesn't obliterate
that nagging sense that 'all this
came from somewhere'.
A n d even more, what we do not
know, indeed cannot know, from
science speaks for the existance of
something beyond science. T h e
longings of the human heart, our
well-nigh irresistable desires and
affections, that biochemistry can't
satisfactorily explain, impel us
towards a higher knowledge than is
accessible to simple laboratory
work. Easy enough to say it's all a
matter of electrical impulses and
c h e m i c a l reactions - r e m i n d
yourself o f when your father dies,
or your girlfriend says she loves
you, or a friend in the burn unit o f
a hospital or the birth of your first
child. The question will assert itself,
'why do we have these reactions
and impulses?' Is chemistry the last
answer?
T h e mere existance o f such
questions d o e s n ' t v o u c h for
Christianity, but Christianity offers
real answers. F o r all scientists who
happen to also be human beings,
Christianity may merit a bit o f
research.

more, we are running a series of

core facts o f Christianity every
