their Felix late last week - this was

A Very Interesting Read.
Anything y o u wish to include in
Felix ought to be in the Felix office
by 12.30 Monday. This applies to
the U n i o n Office as well. I get very
upset if things arrive afterwards
because by then I have arranged the
page plan and often there is no room
to put the articles in. This makes the
magazine less current, makes me
frustrated and y o u angry. In a
similar vein, Fridays and Mondays
are the best time to come and talk
to me about printing or print unit
business. Likewise I will be in a
better mood to help you photocopy
on those days. Anyone demanding
help in n o n - Felix business o n
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and above
all Thursdays will take a very low
priority. Y o u will have to wait until
I have a spare moment.

I can't do much about the other
parts o f the address (though I ' m
working o n it) but I can with Felix.
There are good reasons why Felix
should stay as Felix - there is a
tradition, and those few who know
what Felix is might get confused.
I would like your reaction to the
possibility along with sensible
alternatives o f a different name.
