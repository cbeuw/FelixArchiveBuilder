Waiting for Godot
Samuel Beckett wrote Waiting For
Godot in 1955, which makes it all
the more remarkable that it sounds
extraordinarily as though it were
written with Rik Mayall and Adrian
Edmonson in mind. W h i c h is just
as well, since it is none other than
they who tread the boards to bring
us this adaptation (designed by
Derek Jarman, although it could
equally well have been Derek
Griffiths).
T h e story tells of two gentlemen
of fortune ( O K , tramps) who are
waiting for Godot. That's about it
really. While they wait they discuss
life etc. and complain of the clap,
not to mention meeting the odd rum
cove. W e l l , exactly two actually.
However, Sam (as we know Him)
manages to simultaneously weave
this into what the program notes
claim is an Allegory of the Theatre
O f T h e Absurd. W h i c h it may well
be, but what this translates to is that
very little happens over a great deal
of time. Vladimir and Estragon are
generally unhappy with their lot,
although Estragon is pretty much
incapable of remembering any of it
and V l a d i m i r is too b u s y
pontificating on the finer points of
philosophy to notice. D u r i n g their
vigil, they repeatedly fail to make
sense of their experiences in an
endless l o o p w h i c h b e c o m e s
steadily more tiresome, especially
Gerbil/Tetsuo at the
Science Museum
Michael Faraday! Charles Babbage!
R A L the Robot! What is there to
say?
W e l l , probably a little bit more
than that would be useful. A t the
moment the Science M u s e u m (free
to I C , kids !) boasts a veritable
feast, nay, glut of exhibitions to
regale your senses.
T y i n g in with the Festival of
Japan, we start with a Robotics in
Japan exhib which features loads
(count t h e m , loads) o f o u r
mechanical Mecchano pals in a
variety of exciting ' n ' fresh roles.
Most of the twiddly devils are
displaying their skills at useful tasks
like balancing spinning tops on eggs
or building small steel boxes with
flag designs on them. Either that or
climbing walls very badly (ie. with
all the alacrity of a stoned squirrel)
and pretending to be on Mars. Lots
of them do nice arty things,
i n c l u d i n g R A L h i m s e l f , an
industrial welding robot who counts
dancing (yeah !) and sumi painting
amongst his hobbies. Jolly nice
paintings he does too; I shall
treasure m y black-and- white
bamboo for some time to come.
Meanwhile, downstairs there's a
special bit referring to the work of
C h a r l e s B a b b a g e , E s q . , the
gentleman responsible for the
wonderfully baroque Difference
E n g i n e . Said E n g i n e was an
a b o r t i v e attempt to b u i l d a
mechanical Victorian computer,
which never succeeded in its day.
This failure was put down at the
time to the h a p p y - g o - l u c k y
m
technology of the times, but now
100 ! years later the M u s e u m has
b u i l t a w o r k i n g v e r s i o n to
Babbage's own specs, all glistening
brass and clickety-clockety ratchety
things. Hooray !
A n d upstairs again, a gallery
devoted to the life and works of
Michael Faraday and if I have to tell
you who he is you should be
ashamed of yourself. Lots of weird
and w o n d e r f u l e l e c t r i c a l
paraphernalia and the man himself
(despite his great old age) lectures
every day.
A l l good rip roarin' educational
fun and free too. D o n ' t forget that
if nothing else you can fight off the
kiddies in Launch Pad and play with
the gizmos.
The Flying Gerbil
Every day hundreds of students
walk past a major tourist attraction
without a second glance. T h e
Science M u s e u m , repository of
genius, is currently F R E E to
students at Imperial, so there's no
excuse not to see the exhibition of
current and futuristic Japanese
Technology, open until October
31st.
After an appalling (but short)
video, a small display contains the
precursors to Japanese robots.
These ancient toys use sand and
balances to move, delivering tea or
tumbling down steps. Through a
doorway, however, one hits the
forefront of technology with a
walking robot that moves like a
gracefully slow animal and a
window cleaner that will climb
given that said experiences are so
few, consisting mainly of getting
beaten up and mixing with a strange
class of people. There is a lot of
visual humour and a few great gags,
but the air of melancholy prevails
(thanks to the script rather than R i k
and A d e ' s portrayal). T h e story
turns to metaphor and leaves the
audience something to think about.
T h e thinking time easily elapses in
the time it takes to get outside.
T h e play may introduce a new
generation to Beckett or simply
disappoint both purists of literature
and bottom jokes. I liked it, and we
saw Harry Enfield in the audience.

vertical walls.
D o n ' t walk past the video
screens, they demonstrate some of
the most impressive robotics of the
show. M y favourites are the pipe
welder and the pipe cleaner. T h e
first welds a section of pipe from
the inside whereas the second
inches its way along a thin tube,
turning and dragging its multiple
sections round corners and up
straights. W i t h h e a d l i g h t s
resembling the head of a tapeworm,
it could be straight from a sci-fi
horror movie!
T h e second half of the exhibition
is interesting, but a little run of the
mill. It contains industrial robots
performing more aesthetically
pleasing tasks, such as portrait
painting and flower arranging. T h e
introduction, however, is worth a
m e n t i o n , b e i n g the most
cringe worthy part of the display. It
contains an Americanised A l i c e
T h r o u g h the L o o k i n g G l a s s
strolling though current technology
in simulated 3 D . Worth a look if
you can stand it.
It's an interesting exhibition, with
demonstrations of all the machines
scheduled throughout the day. Y o u
must not miss the first working
model of Babbage's difference
engine either, situated behind the
shop. Everybody at IC should take
advantage of the free entrance,
especially you lady engineers, since
one of the staff was complaining of
the predominance of males. Sounds
familiar doesn't it.
