The first Monday of term and after
the amazingly stressful registration
process everybody was in need of
a nice relaxing evening. The New
Year's Party was anything but.

T h e compere had a nice line in
understated laddish humour. Sadly
he believed that the only common
factor in ' Y o o f culture is an
undying wish to talk about football.
H e ran through a list of important
topics such as, T h e Police, more
football, drugs and your Grandmas

introducing us to the first act;

oooh, between five and ten minutes.
If, however, you are reading this
review because you can't remember

will teach you not to drink to
excess.
The Family Cat were much the
same.
What do you mean, you want to
know what I thought. What is this,

sounded pretty much the same as
every other indie guitar band, not
to say they're bad. Not to say they
were different either. They just are,
like John Major just is.

T h e music played and the people

Wednesday was T h e Freshers

After a short break, the awesome,
long awaited A l a n Parker stormed

Voice of the Beehive, now there's
a good live band. 'Monsters A n d
Angels', T Say Nothing', classic
pop songs all of them. What a coup
to get them to play here. I saw them
the other week at Cambridge, and
they were bloody good. I wonder
how they'll fare at I C U ?
U p the stairs then. Through the
door, and what is it. Not B-hives at
all. Some kind of crap music, but
seeing as I am the only person in
this building who actually saw them
unfortunately none of which were
on sale here, they're signed to the
same record label as The Cure. So
what are they like?
Bloody good, as you're asking.
If you missed this through queueing

Thank G o d it's Friday! The last day
o f what will probably the most
enjoyable week at Imperial College.
In addition to the bands and disco
there were the traditonal casino and
film shows. Outside burgers and the
lethal cocktails were on offer, ready
to remove your money and your
brain cells.
The Disciples had about as much
life as a small squashed hedgehog
that doesn't describe them as crap,
I don't see why I should disagree
with such overwhelming public
opinion, or something.
Candyland A l l non freshers
please refer to last years review of
Candyland. I still think they're
following me, you know, I mean,
why else would they come to
Imperial. I mean, this band have
played Wembley Arena, and have
cooler T-shirts than James or Neds,
Ray JellyBelly's Giants Of Jive
were, well, jive. I haven't found
anyone who likes jive yet, but when
I do, I'll tell you what they thought.
I thought that they were quite good,
but the music just ain't my style
honey.
