Forgery
Clarification
Dear Adam,
I am writing to clarify a few
points made in your news article
about forged £10 notes.
T h e Carnival organised on the
Monday of Freshers' Week was not
the work of the Royal College of
Science U n i o n , but the work of
Imperial College U n i o n and IC
Ents. A l l R C S Union organised was
the burger stall at this event.
T h e notes that were found on the
stall were noticed after I had
returned a forgery to a customer
trying to buy some food. I checked
the till and found two others, and
Sports Centre
Investment
Dear Adam,
Proposals to change the Sports
Centre and to develop the Southside
facilities represent an investment by
the College of the order of £0.75m.

T h e C o l l e g e invites applications for the
new position o f warden at Clayponds
w h i c h is available from 1st D e c e m b e r
1991.
C l a y p o n d s is an exciting new C o l l e g e
residential development in Ealing, mainly
for 2nd and 3rd year undergrads and
postgrads.
W a r d e n s r e c e i v e r e n t - f r e e
accommodation in return for pastoral
duties within their residence. The post is
open to all non-undergrad members o f the
college.
If y o u w o u l d like further info and an
application form contact Louise A i l w a r d ,
ext 8690/3276, R o o m 516, Sherfield.
C l o s i n g date for applications is 31
October 1991
T h e plan is that this outlay should
be recouped by encouraging more
use by both college and non-college
personnel. S i n c e , d u r i n g the
vacation and at weekends in term
time, the Sports Centre is very
much under-used this would seem
to be a sensible idea from which
everyone should benefit.
What we have to ensure is that
preferential use is retained by
college personnel and also that the
changes, whilst attracting outside
users, do not represent an
unacceptable c o m p r o m i s e for
college users.
These proposals of change have
to be approved by the Athletics
Committee which is responsible to
the Governing Body for college
sports provision. I have asked V a l
Straw, the Facilities Manager to
provide a display of the architects
drawings in the Sports Centre so
that users can see what is planned
and can inform their representative
on the Athletics Committee o f their
opinions.
Yours sincerely,
Ken Stevens.
I wrote 'Forgery' across them, so
they could not be used again. Not,
as your article implied, that the stall
received these notes with forgery
written across them.
O n finding the notes, I told Andy
Flanagan, the U n i o n Bar Manager,
and also the organiser o f the IC
Rugby Cocktails.
I hope this rectifies the
involvement of the R C S U n i o n and
the happenings on M o n d a y night.
Yours sincerely,
Gareth Smith, RCSU Honorary
Secretary 1988-90

Dear Adam,
I am writing to congratulate
everyone involved in the events
organised last week. They were all
smoothly run and very enjoyable.
Friday's event however was slightly
m a r r e d for me by a v e r y
unfortunate incident.
A member of the R C S Burger
crew showed a marked lack of
intelligence and 'borrowed' two
knives from the M i n e ' s Cocktail
stall. This resulted in a slight
altercation. A s the organiser of the
Burgers, I would like to apologise
to Mines and can assure you it will
not happen again. The missing knife
has been recovered and will be
returned, contact me somehow.
O n e o f the guests had a
marvellous idea, if he stole two
bags of burger rolls he could get
twenty-four burgers free! I hope
y o u ' r e feeling very proud o f
yourself and would appreciate a £24
donation to Rag to cover the cost.
Once again, sorry to Mines.
David Ensell, RCS Ents Chair.
