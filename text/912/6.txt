Cranes - Wings of Joy
of the state of grace thrust upon
them, I should look for any reason
to criticise (never one to bow to
p e e r p r e s s u r e , y o u k n o w ) .
H o w e v e r , h a v i n g interviewed
A l i s o n Shaw and found H e r to be
all things to this particular man, M y
objectivity is looking decidedly
punch-drunk. Listening to Wings of
Joy, it's easy to conclude that this
poor, deluded wanker was always
going to be devastated. Bloody well
floored, in fact.
Eskimos & Egypt
-Don't You Do It
W h e n I got my rather grubby mits
on this one I thought 'great, a dance
record that means something, not all
this 'move you body, body', shit',
what an amazing and regrettable
disappointment.
Their rip-off of G ' n ' R ' s Sweet
C h i l d of M i n e showed these crass
r o c k e r s in their true l i g h t ,
homophobic, macho bullshiters that
have about as much talent as the
flies on my dogs back. This will be
lost amongst the myriad of Sharon
and T r a c y discos around the
country. It may bring them chart
success but would you wont to be
the one to knock Brian Adams off
number one? I thought not
Pebbles
Yes. I have dreaded the prospect o f
reviewing this. Lost sleep over it.
D a m n near cut off the end of my
finger because of it. T h e brute truth
about Wings of Joy is it's colossal,'
yet at the same time, gentle and
understated beauty. This is why I
should hate them. I'm supposed to
articulate suitably elegant prose,
and it's supposed to be (reasonably)
tangible. M a k i n g Cranes tangible is
selling them short, and why should
they stoop to earthbound flesh when
they're busy etching a trail to
infinity?...!
Watersong is fine, a deliriously-
layered mesh of heat-damaged
spray-paint textures enveloping,
with A l i s o n holding both can and
blow-torch. Starblood. Jesus. Give
M e air, for fuck's sake. Starblood.
Carter USM
-After the
Watershed
I make no bones about this; I do not
like Carter. It is for this reason I
formally apologise to Ginny of 'Bad
M o o n ' . I am the last person who
should represent Felix at a press
conference for Carter, but at the
time, there was no-one else. Sorry.
O h , and while there were worse
bands at Reading this year, it is not
enough to be a minor improvement
on shit. So they reckon Andrew
Eldritch thinks they're the second
best band around? Yeah, sure.
Wayne Hussey believed H i m , as
well.
T h e most elegant stiletto piercing
and, with incalculable care and
sensitivity, scraping up and down
the length of Alison's vertebrae;
mine too. I'm dying here, slowly,
hopelessly, deliciously, dying. M y
God. M e . I don't deserve to dielike
this. Where's M y Hate Now I Need
It?.
M y whole passage thro' these sonic
night-scapes is fraught with the chill
of a primal anguish, and the harsh,
angular shadows of a blind fury.
Christ knows how I could be so
arrogant as to believe that I could
adequately translate this for you.
Yeah. With such as Leaves of
Summer, Tomorrow's Tears,
Hopes Are High, I discover M y
nemesis hidden behind M y heart's
desire. M y nemesis is the Snow
Queen. Y o u remember Her, don't
Y o u ? She summoned the ghost of
breathing and blew snowflakes on
K a y ' s heart. W e l l , such fragile,
filigree structures are currently
colliding with mine, and they're no
longer melting...
W h o gives a damn, I'm past
caring. Basically, if Y o u ' r e still
reading this, if you haven't thrown
it down and gone out and bought
this fucking record, then you are
first class twat. This is not a random
insult. I have concluded this from
the obvious lack of value Y o u place
on L i f e . If y o u have any
disagreement with this, come into'
the office and I will play Adoration
to you. It's the last song. It is also
extraordinary, sullen and gorgeous,
a slight legion of blurring, water-
washed features and misshapen
definitions. O h , give M e Wings of
Joy that I may bring it to all things.
Y e s . M y loathing K n o w s no
bounds. The A l b u m of the Year.
D a v i d .
Wretchedly enough, Carter have
again turned in quite a decent
record. These people are becoming
naggingly difficult to deal with; if
it was all Clash stylisms and
ridiculous punning (read 'John
Player Special number 666') they
would be easily dispensed with.
What buggers up my attempt to
make a whipping boy out of Carter
is, in this case, a bare keyboard
o p e n i n g e x u d i n g pathos a n d
sensitivity, a line like 'Goodbye,
Ruby Tuesday; come home, you
silly cow', and Jimbob's idiomatic
angst howling the above over the
fade. It's one of those peculiar,
social tales, indicting, awkward and
jarring. Y e a h , on the strength of
this, I might actually grow to like
them. N o w , for fuck's sake, give
me my Steely D a n tape back.

-Raid The Palace
I think this might be some kind of
subversive attack on our wonderful
royal family. If I slag this I can
forget being Lady Lise, can't I?
Right then, this is a bloody terrible
record. O n the other hand, it might
be the first shot in a campaign to
close the Camden Palace due to
obscene pigs. In that case, I'd like
to point out that they do say 'make
some noise', which should be
reserved for people as crass as M C
Hammer, and there's a strange kind
of Country and Western style
geeeetar in there as well. It reminds
me of Bob Geldof's Vegetarians Of
Love, The Housemartins, Hothouse
Flowers, stuff like that. Quite good
really. Bang goes my knighthood.

-I Want You
What is Great Northern Electrics?
It's the railway line from Kings
Cross to Leeds, Y o r k and the North
E a s t , and it goes t h r o u g h
Knebworth. This is a perfectly good
reason to give it a right slagging.
However someone (fresher) did
float the suggestion that I should
possibly listen to the record before
reviewing it. H o w peculiar. Still,
try anything once, I suppose. It
starts with something that might
possibly be a train sample. Stop the
record, I want to get off. Somebody
stop it. Never mind, it's gone now.
I'll listen to it all, if you're going
to be like that. Sounds a bit indie,
a bit Paris Angels, and there's some
kind of fruit on the front cover,
which is always a good sign. (Does
Bryan Adams have fruit on his front
cover? See what I mean?) So,
perfectly bearable, not particularly
offensive to the ears or eyes.
