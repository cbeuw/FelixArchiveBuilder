The world is so full of 'isms'—
racism, sexism, ageism. D o we
really need to take on board a new
one? I'd say yes because there is a
prejudice which has affected me and
which might affect you also. It is
Graduateism.
Graduateism
'Being a
graduate and a
female and of
Indian origin
was a very
disconcerting
experience.'
Y o u ' l l be spared the sordid
details, but suffice it to say that
many companies ask for high
calibre graduates without really
having any knowledge of their
personal needs, aspirations or
capabilities, and we—delicate
flowers—can be made to work with
people who are actively resentful of
what they see as silver-spoon
upstarts.
So now let the muck-chucking
begin. I was offered a job by a large
merchant b a n k — w h i c h looked
good. I was one of only three
graduates to be taken on in their
computing area—which sounded
great. I was paid megabucks—
which felt brilliant. But then I was
dumped into a technical back-water,
shaken by fears of redundancy and
subjected to a working environent
suffused with fag-smoke, innuendo,
racism and ignorance. Most of my
data centre colleagues were thinly
disguised spivs who expressed open
hostility to the 'bloody graduates',
'bloody foreigners' and of course
the monstrous regimen of women.
Hence me, being a graduate and a
female and, incidentally, of Indian
origin—it was certainly a very
disconcerting experience to say the
least.
Job satisfaction? In my first four
months, I had to tab spaces and put
carriage returns into several very
large documents. M y productivity
was measured by how many
carriage returns/spell checks and
tabs I made per day! (Nobody
believes me, but it's true!). The rest
of my stay at the bank (another one
year) was equally mind numbing.
When I complained about the trivial
nature of the work, I was told that
I "was trying to run before I could
walk. C a n y o u imagine how
frustrated I felt after a first class
honours degree from Imperial and
an M S c in computing? I felt as if
I was washing my career life away
w i t h no m e a n i n g f u l w o r k
experience that another company
would find useful (maybe that was
a deliberate corporate policy!).
A n y w a y , in the end I got the
'golden handshake' (in other words
my job no longer existed).
I suspect it has something to do
with my not shutting up and putting
up with racism (as my manager has
often 'advised' me to do! O h — h o w
I wish I had taped some of those
conversations!!).
I can't complain too much since
I came away with substantial
redundancy payment. But it is not
enough to quench the heat of
resentment although starting a P h D
at Imperial almost immediately
afterwards has certainly softened
the blow.
So my advice to my fellow IC
students is, even in these harsh
economic conditions, do look
before you leap or you may cause
permanent damage to your career.
P.S. Since I left in M a r c h of this
year, several of the colleagues at
Citibank who I did like and respect
have also left most by their own
accord, with quite a few returning
to university studies!

Stress dodged the herbal stress
relieving bomb on his port side and
swung his fighter ship around for
another attack on the leptons.
Tightening the higher thought
constrictor about his head he
gunned the plasma engines sending
his earth attack ship screaming
towards the alien craft. He had no
thoughts of death, in fact he had
very few thoughts at all due to the
implanted narrow mind controller
lodged in his cerebrum. H e had
blessed its presence several times
already in this space fight for saving
him from the aliens' worst, in fact
only weapon: free thought.
His onboard defence system
beeped agressively warning him of
the approach of a cluster of rational
thought bombs, feared throughout
earth's space fleet for its effects of
clear thoughts, relaxation and
prejudice-free views. He swung his
ship to avoid it and at that instance
he was hit.
A N A G G R E S S I O N
R E L I E V I N G B O M B H A S
S T R U C K U S ! ! ! Screamed the
defence console. H e knew he had
only seconds now before the
onboard systems would shed their
hatreds, violent urges and psychotic
tendencies and become vile useless
things discussing the long term
value of conflict. Stress powered
the engines as far as they would go
and shot forward to do his bit for
the cause that was everything in his
life. He knew the enemy. He knew
the truth. H e knew what to do.
A s i n t e l l i g e n c e e x p a n d i n g
t o r p e d o e s w e r e d o d g e d a n d
destroyed the first effects of the
enemy strike took effect. T h e
marching songs on the ship's
speakers crackled and cut out and
Stress s w o r e h a r d as their
replacement bombarded his ears.
' Y O U ' V E L O S T T H A T

A v o i d i n g the last o f the peaceful
intention mines Stress locked the
enemy ship in his sights.
' N O W I T ' S G O N E , G O N E ,
G O N E ! '
Eyes ablaze he stabbed the fire
button.
F r o m out of his gunports a
rainbow o f colours emerged,
showering the space around his ship
in iridescent sparkling lights that
danced and shone. Stress cursed
volumes. T h e bomb had taken out
his weapons system. Ignoring the
soothing voices and words on the
speakers and his screens he flew on.
' D o n ' t let this aggression fester
inside, recognise it for what it is,
a blackness obscuring your true
feelings. D o n ' t be afraid to cry, to
confess and become a better
person.'
Stress screamed in triumph as his
craft charged towards the target ship
on collision course. H e was not
afraid to die. H e knew that he
would go straight to heaven if he'd
died fighting. T h e rest of eternity
winning was not something to be
afraid of.
