Tiddlywinking and
Penguin on Monopoly.
Roses around Eros. T h e n despite a
valiant attempt to escape, Penguin
was grabbed by the C C U Execs and
was thrown into the fountain.
After lunch, the vans ferried most
people to the Macaulay A r m s ,
Notting H i l l Gate, to try to ' D r i n k -
a-pub-dry'. B y mid—afternoon, the
bar staff had realised that everyone
was there for the sole purpose of
consuming vast quantities of alcohol
with the ultimate aim of drinking
the place dry.
T h e following information is
courtesy of an independent expert:
'Boddington's and L o n d o n Pride
were off within half an hour, before
most of the collectors had arrived!
A barrel of Flowers Original was
put on by the staff and was off by
7pm. That's 288 pints in itself. T h e
staff then put on an unsettled
L o n d o n P r i d e w h i c h n o - o n e
touched as it wasn't fit to drink. N o
others came off tap, but all were
severely depleted and a couple of
shorts were drained. A l l in all, I
reckon it was a triumphant success!'
Although the pub was not drunk
d r y , there was an excellent
atmosphere amongst the collectors
(and a few others). T h e whole
afternoon and evening was declared
a c o m p l e t e s u c c e s s .
Fun and frolics on Oxford Street
Tiddlywinking down Oxford
Street is always well attended, but
this year the turn-out exceeded
everyone's expectations.
T h e day began with everyone
assembling at Southside where they
were led in a V E R Y loud call of
'Wakey Wakey Southside' by this
year's R A G chairman, Penguin.
Union vans then ferried everyone
to Speaker's Corner (Hyde Park)
for the start of the mammoth
Tiddlywink. After Kangelas and
Boomalakas, the tiddlywinking
began at about noon. A r m e d with
R A G collecting cans and a few
tiddlywinks, nearly 220 students
tiddlywinked there way along
Oxford Street and Regent Street to
Eros, collecting money from the
crowds of shoppers as they went.
T w o of the inviolate mascots —
Jez and B o — accompanied the
tiddlywinkers on their travels. Most
people finished by about 2pm and
despite the fact that it started to rain,
everyone joined in Ring-a-Ring-a-
Hiya! It's Penguin, the R A G
Chairman here. Well, last Saturday
was (almost) beyond belief. W e
raised an amazing £2800, which
was double last year's total, and had
lots of fun too.
Great effort was put in by all of
the C C U and Rag people, but
ultimately it was those who put their
all into 'collecting, winking and
drinking' who really made it an
event to remember! So well done to
all concerned!
Before I tell you about L i v e
M o n o p o l y (it's great, do it, y o u ' l l
have fun, we'll raise loads . . .
ooops! S o r r y , sales pitch on
overdrive) I'd better chuck in some
thank-yous. Thanks must go to Dice
and Games who generously donated
2,000 tiddlywinks, without which
the whole day wouldn't have been
possible. Thanks also to A to Z
Geographers' M a p C o L t d , who
kindly donated 15 colour A to Zs,
to give as prizes to the top 15
freshers. A n d thanks to all the
drivers and the C C U s for their help.
Right well that's enough of me
t h a n k i n g p e o p l e , n o w
M O N O P O L Y (it's great, do it,
you'll have F u n , we'll raise loads
. . . oops sorry again). L i v e
M o n o p o l y is always great fun and
raises loads! It's a team game, so
get your team of 4 to 6 together
N O W if you haven't already.
Basically we give each team a set
of clues and each member of each
team gets a collecting can. T h e
clues are your team's reason for
manically mobbing your way all
over our beloved capital.
W e ' v e basically got a clue for every
street on the Monopoly board. Each
clue, for which you have to visit the
street to be able to solve, is worth
a certain number of points. T h e
team with the most points wins. The
C C U ' s motorised mascots will be
t r a v e l l i n g a r o u n d to act as
Community Chest and Chance
cards, and a roaming jail van will
also be on the prowl to capture any
team it sees. Y o u can also get points
in other ways. These include
collecting lots of money (this is the
easiest way), having a team mascot
which must be carried at all times,
turning up in fancy dress (the sillier
the better), and by acquiring
treasure.
'Treasure' is always a dubious
title, because most people tend to,
well let's not beat around the bush
on this one, 'nick' signs and cones.
This isn't difficult, let's face it,
anyone can nick a cone! So we're
looking for 'clever' treasure. In the
past, clever treasure has included a
fast-food baseball cap, a fast food
employee's badge saying ' G r i m
Reaper, how may I help y o u ? ' and
an arrest warrant all of these were
obtained by haggle and banter, not
spanner and boltcutters. So there's
a challenge for you!
P R I Z E S . Yes, there are prizes,
too! Firstly there's the prizes from
M E N C A P (for w h o m w e ' r e
collecting) for the highest personal
totals of the day. These are B I G .
The final total collected was
£2,804.81, compared with £1,400
c o l l e c t e d at last y e a r ' s
tiddlywinking. T h e approximate
totals for the individual C C U s are:
R C S - £1750
C & G - £870
M i n e s - £120
T h e top fresher collector was
Tamsin Braisher who managed to
get £53.71 and the overall top
collector was Massie Harper who
collected £77.43. Both totals are
excellent. W e l l done to everyone
else who collected - every penny
helps!
A l l of the money collected on
Saturday is going to Action Aid,
who help people in the third world
to help themselves.
If Tiddlywinking is anything to
go by, then this year's R A G
(including the L i v e M o n o p o l y
tomorrow) should be B I G !
Beccy Land
T h e catch is that there are lots o f
other R A G s coming to collect for
the day, so y o u ' l l have to compete
against them. There are also prizes
from us here at I C R A G . O u r usual
incentive scheme also operates
(collect £50 for a m u g , £150 for a
T-shirt and £300 for a sweatshirt),
so if you've already collected some
money at Tiddlywinks, you've got
a head start!
Last year, M o n o p o l y raised
£4,600, but with our astounding
start to this year, I reckon we could
easily double that! A l l we need are
L O T S of teams collecting L O T S of
money and having L O T S of fun in
the process! So, dress up, be silly
and we'll see you for registration in
B E I T Q U A D from 10am onwards
(though we want everyone back by
6pm, so the sooner you start, the
more time you have!
So, Be M a d , Be Silly & Be Part
O f It!! Cheers,
P E N G U I N - Rag Chair 91/92
PS Beccy did this year's clues, so
she's the one to bribe (if you can
find out who she is).
P P S Last Saturday we woke up
Southside at the crack of 11am.
L o o k out Beit! A n y suggestions for
a W a k e y W a k e y E v e l y n Gardens?
