BOOKSTORE
OK, so it's the beginning of the new
academic year again! Although you may not
want to part with your cash straight away,
may we suggest you visit the Imperial
College Union Bookstore to see how we can
help you.
Psntel
Not only do we try to stock all your
essential course books, as recommended by
your lecturers, but any titles not stocked, be
it pure science or science fiction, can be
ordered simply and efficiently by our book
ordering service. We also offer a huge
range of stationery at prices to beat any well
known national chain, as well as greetings
cards, confectionery, toiletries and some
household goods. So, whether it's a book, a
biro or a bar of chocolate you want, we 're
sure there's something at ICU Bookstore for
you.
4* PARKER
Don't forget, we are also the only retail
outlet stocking a fantastic range of
merchandise emblazoned with the ICU logo.
Visit early in the week to be sure of one of
our great sweatshirts at only £15, or an ICU
mug at £1.60. Bookmarks, files, t-shirts and
cufflinks are among other popular items.
Remember, we 're at your service, so if
there's anything you need ask one of our
friendly staff and we '11 do our best to help.
We're currently under new management, so
please bear with us as we work towards the
future with you, the customer, as priority.
See you Monday to Friday, between 9am
and 6pm!
