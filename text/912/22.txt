Welfare Advisory Service
At some stage of your time at Imperial
College you may need advice or
information and not know where to
turn. The answer could well be waiting
at the Welfare Office which is situated
within the Union General Office in Beit
Quad. As the Union's Welfare Adviser,
I am available during the times shown
below to give confidential and impartial
advice on a number of issues. You can
get advice on housing rights, benefits,
immigration matters, tax, insurance,
legal matters, consumer rights, student
loans, NHS charges, the Poll Tax,
disability rights, finance...the list goes
on. If you are not sure where to turn,
it is a good idea to consult the Welfare
Office as it is likely that if I cannot
assist you with your particular query I
may be able to refer you to someone
that can. The Welfare Adviser also
offers a debt counselling service and
can, in some cases, negotiate on a
student's behalf with creditors, if
appropriate.
In addition to the above, there are
leaflet racks situated in the reception
area containing a wide range of
information. Most of the literature is
from outside organisations and provides
basic, introductory information ona
number of issues: health, housing, tax,
consumer law, fees and awards, legal
aid and immigration among them. You
will also find information compiled by
the Welfare Adviser on issues such as
overseas students, housing rights and
poll tax. The Welfare Office also
subscribes to 'Which?' magazine and
current and back copies are available
on request.
Remember, the Union's Welfare
Advisory Service is independent of the
college and all matters discussed
therein will be treated in confidence.
Although no appointment is necessary,
students can be seen by prior
arrangement if you have special needs
these should be discussed with me, as I
can be flexible where necessary.
