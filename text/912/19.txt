The handgun pictured above is the Splatmaster Rapide, classed together
with the Kalashnkov.
A C r o w n Court in Wales classed a
paintball gun, the Splatmaster
Rapide, as a prohibited weapon on
the 2nd October. T h e gun is now
ranked in the same weapons class
as Kalashnikovs, mortars and anti-
tank weapons.
Judge H u g h Williams ruled that
this particular weapon, a semi-
automatic paint gun, was to be put
under Section five of the Firearms
A c t 1968. This prevents the use of
the gun even with a firearms
certificate.
D r Jaafar Dhiah Jaafar, a former
research assisstant at Imperial
College is suspected of being a
major force behind Iraq's nuclear
weapons programme.

T h e d e c i s i o n to class the
Splatmaster Rapide as a firearm was
due to its small size and its use of
carbon dioxide as a propellant. T h e
majority of paintball guns in Great
Britain are not semi-automatic and
considerably larger in size.
Paintball is a sport currently
enjoyed by many people in this
country, Imperial College has its
own paintball society, SplotSoc.
Police have not yet enforced this
law and it is likely that the ruling
will be suspended while official
the B a g h d a d A t o m i c E n e r g y
Centre, but D r D a v i d Websdale of
the Physics Department expressed
doubt that D r Jaafar's training was
suitable for the development of
atomic weapons.
