SOCIAL L I F E
A s a residential university, ( J a m -

talking... are a l l b o u n d u p w i t h i n t h e

life is extensive. T h i s is a i d e d b y

abundant, s p e w i n g out g u i t a r sounds

bearing bottles of w i n e , b u t w o m e n

b y a large n u m b e r of secretarial c o l -

in a n d a r o u n d t h e t o w n .
WORK
F o r most undergraduates, a c a d e m i c
w o r k continues to b e based a r o u n d
the w e e k l y tutorials. T h i s is less
true i n the sciences w h e r e lectures
play a n important role. A f a m i l i a r
c o m p l a i n t , d e p e n d i n g o n t h e lectur-
er, is that science lectures degenerate
i n t o c o p y i n g exercises a n d notes
m i g h t as w e l l be d u p l i c a t e d a n d
distributed. I n general, however,
libraries p r o v i d e t h e b a c k g r o u n d w i t h
the w e e k l y tutorial a n d essays t h e
focus of work. T h e variation i n the
a m o u n t of work1
achieved b y s t u d -
ents is. vast. W h i l e some involve
themselves w i t h a l l that C a m b r i d g e
has to offer n o n - a c a d e m i c a l l y
throughout t h e week, a n d frantically
piece together a n essay at t w o i n
the m o r n i n g before the next day's
tutorial, others fill their lives almost
c o m p l e t e l y w i t h w o r k . T h e i n c i d e n c e
of m e n t a l ill-health at C a m b r i d g e is
extremely h i g h . W h e t h e r this is d u e
to t h e p a c e of t h e w o r k or t h e i n -
herent natures of t h e undergraduates

EXPANSION
T h e C a m b r i d g e undergraduates life
has a u n i q u e setting. It neither
exists o n a campus, n o r is it absorb-
ed w i t h i n a c i t y c o m m u n i t y . T h e
t o w n , t h e Colleges a n d t h e U n i v e r s -
ity buildings m i n g l e , b u t a r o u n d the
m e d i a e v a l centre of t h e t o w n —
a r o u n d the o l d market s q u a r e — m a n y
of t h e shops, pubs a n d restaurants
are essentially orientated towards t h e
U n i v e r s i t y ; lunches are taken i n C o l -
lege pubs; bookshops have t h e
stamp of t h e U n i v e r s i t y on t h e m :
even tobacco shops cater for the
student clientele a n d gather some-
t h i n g of t h e tradition a n d feeling ot
the U n i v e r s i t y .
L i k e a l l Britain's universities
i n t h e post-Robbins e r a , C a m b r i d g e
is expanding. T h e n e w colleges of
F i t z w i l l i a m a n d N e w H a l l h a v e b e e n
built a d d i n g the a r c h i t e c t u r a l styles
of the 1960's to a l l that has gone
before. T h i s is not r a d i c a l , however,
for C a m b r i d g e has always b e e n
building. W h a t is oppressive is t h e
expansion of industry a n d glass
shopping arcades a r o u n d t h e M a r k e t
Square. Petty C u r y has a l r e a d y f a l -
len prey a n d Christ's C o l l e g e stands
forlornly lost beside t h e feverish
hive of B r a d w e l l ' s C o u r t . T h e p r o -
b l e m is realised, however, b y b o t h
t o w n a n d g o w n a n d m a y b e solved
b y the formation of a n industrial
city centre to release t h e o l d centre
to its quiet g r o w t h .
E a c h of Britain's universities i n
the 1960's has something separate to
offer. A s a n o l d seat of l e a r n i n g ,
w i t h a w i d e range of disciplines,
C a m b r i d g e has a particular c o n -
tribution to make. It c a n be accused
of a n insularity, of a lack of a w a r e -
ness of t h e direct necessities t h a t
Britain's material w e l l - b e i n g r e q u i r -
es. It is however a n independent
centre of learning a n d n o t a tool of
the state.
If it is possible to s u m u p
C a m b r i d g e i n one single character-
istic that characteristic must b e i n -
tegrity; a n integrity of m i n d w h i c h
it endeavours to instil i n its
graduates.

The Science Museum
by Tim O'Brien
Geograpiucauy toe M-ience museum and imperial College are
separated by a road, many parked can, an ice-cream vssa and a
branch of the General Post Office. Scientifically the separation is
greater and much more ominous. The Museum salutes the Gentle-
men and Martyrs of the subject, or rather the religion—a metaphor
to be justified later. Here the struggles and torments of our
"Church" are recreated in the glass-cased shrines; the temple lacks
only the incense of sulphur and oil-mist. The pilgrims come and
press the little buttons to reincarnate the sacred devices of Watt
and Newcomen, or merely to stand beneath the wings of Bleriot and
be surrounded by the engines of Rolls and Royce.
In ' T h e I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e of
Science a n d T e c h n o l o g y ' , w h e r e is
this atmosphere ? I n this s e m i n a r y ,
w h y is the g o d n o t w o r s h i p p e d ?
There is n o fervour left i n the f a i t h -
ful: there is m o r e interest s h o w n in
the nuns of other beliefs than i n the
pursuit of truth a n d self-mortification
i n the laboratory. T h e lack of faith
in Britain's scientific seminaries w i l l
destroy science. A s w i t h other
religions w h e r e success depends, not
u p o n t h e n u m b e r of members, b u t
on t h e d e d i c a t i o n of individuals, so
the success of science depends n o t
on t h e n u m b e r of scientists b u t on
the q u a l i t y and single-mindedness of
its sages a n d novices. T h e t i m e has
c o m e f o r a R e f o r m a t i o n ; t h e age
that gave us phlogiston must b e
restored.
A R e f o r m a t i o n is needed; b u t h o w
is this t o b e inaugurated? Religious
problems, whatever the religion m a y
be generalised a n d parallels m a y
easily b e d r a w n . Christianity as
every n o n - C h r i s t i a n a n d m a n y
Christians k n o w is o n t h e decline.
T h e reason for this is obvious. A s k
a cleric w h e n his faith was at its
greatest a n d he w i l l give y o u dates
Detween w n i c h persecution w a s at
its most intense a d authority most
total. N o t h i n g unites p e o p l e of l i k e
t h i n k i n g m o r e than a c o m m o n enemy,
a n d n o t h i n g consolidates this u n i o n
m o r e than absolute subjection to
one m a n or one b o d y of m e n . T o d a y
to its detriment, Christianity is not
persecuted i n this country; h e n c e
tne hierarchy d o not exercise control
ot tlieir subjects. T h a t element k n o w n
as free t h i n k i n g is u n d e r m i n i n g the
very essence of organised religion
a n u , c o m p l a c e n c y is t h e result. T h e
remedy is obvious. Persecution a n d
intolerance must be reinstigated.
Science, as a r e l i g i o n is experienc-
i n g tins decline. T h e symptoms are
popularity, acceptance of n e w ideas
on merit alone a n d belief i n t h e
sometimes ridiculous. Science has
b e c o m e popular, n o t too popular,
just popular. N o b o d y hates scientists
any more. Responsibility for this
rests w i t h t h e doctrine itself. H e r e
we have t h e only religion w h i c h
w h e n o n trial insists o n p r o v i n g i t -
self correct, a n d the habit repeated
over t h e centuries has l e d t h e
populace f r o m superstition a n d i n -
tolerance into a n acceptance a n d
general desire to b e i n o n t h e act.
C o n s e q u e n t l y w e have t h e d i l u t i o n
a n d weakness epitomised b y Baxter
a n d t h e W o r l d T o m o r r o w b r a n d of
popular science. T h e C h e m i s t r y set,
that subtle w e a p o n designed to b u r n
little c h i l d r e n a n d hence alienate
their mothers from the T r u t h , has
n o w become the T e a c h Yourself
Science Set a n d has h a d a l l danger-
ous combinations removed. T h e r e -
sult is a system of coloured w a t e r
a n d chalk w h i c h not only fails to
instil a distrust of a l l things
scientific b u t actually encourages the
c h i l d to scientific ambitions. T h i s
p h e n o m e n o n a n d others like it serve
only to u n d e r m i n e the precept that
science must b e v i e w e d w i t h
suspicion f r o m w i t h o u t for this is
the only w a y to retain the solidarity
a n d strength of belief, so necessary.
T h e days have gone w h e n science
was d e e m e d heresy,* d u e perhaps to
C h r i s t i a n decline as m u c h as
scientific decline a n d so it w o u l d
seem that unless the w o r l d becomes
artist d o m i n a t e d w e must w a i t f o r
C h r i s t i a n r e v i v a l to p r o v i d e the p e r -
secution necessary.
T h e other t w o symptoms m e n t i o n -
ed, acceptance of n e w ideas o n merit
alone a n d belief i n t h e ridiculous
c a n b e attributed to a lack of
authority, a n d hence hypocrisy,
w i t h i n t h e w h o l e scientific c o m m u n -
ity. T h e conservatism w h i c h m a d e
the religion w h a t it is, is fast dis-
appearing. T h e hypocrisy of the past
is a d m i r a b l y demonstrated i n the
T e m p l e . T h e r e , a device k n o w n as
Foucault's P e n d u l u m shows b e y o n d
doubt that the earth does not rotate
but oscillates gently o n a n axis
t h r o u g h South K e n s i n g t o n . T h a n k s to
the conservatism of the ancients this
concept has been t w i s t e d into a
proof that t h e earth does i n fact
go round. B u t was E i n s t e i n greeted
w i t h such sceptism ? It w o u l d a p -
pear not, as his ideas were actually
w e l c o m e d as those of a saint. It is
clear n o w that he s h o u l d h a v e b e e n
eliminated, as a subversive element
should always be e l i m i n a t e d . H e
dared to question the very roots of
classical belief b u t because t h e r a
was n o authority r e m a i n i n g t o c o n -
d e m n h i m , he was a l l o w e d t o c o n -
tinue his activities u n h i n d e r e d . T h e
result w a s that he n o t o n l y question-
ed accepted theory b u t w e n t so f a r
as to prove it w r o n g , w h i c h has l e d
to the situation w e n o w have i n
w h i c h n o b o d y understands a n y t h i n g .
T o prevent a n y reoccurence of this
a hierarchy of bigots must b e set u p ;
they must pledge themselves t o
hinder progress as m u c h as possible
a n d must have powers of i n q u i s i t i o n
a n d T r i a l b y O r d e a l at their disposal.
T n e dedicated scientist must have
something to fight against a n d so
p r o v e himself. I n this w a y h e w i l l
perhaps t h i n k t w i c e before h e p r e -
cipitates the r e w r i t i n g of text-books
a n d revolutions of thought w h i c h
m a k e science today so tiring. A n
u n - P u b l i c i t y D e p a r t m e n t must b e
established w h i c h severely restricts
the p u b l i c a t i o n of data for the l a y -
m a n . Scientific establishments must
be m a i n t a i n e d u n d e r the utmost
secrecy, for only b y the employment
of methods such as these c a n p u b l i c
distrust a n d hence hatred m a k e
science w h a t it once was.
