Are you a thief?
It seems most unfortunate to me that the ' corporate honesty" of a b o d y
should be i n inverse p r o p o r t i o n to its size. Dishonesty amongst the student
body is n o w a serious a n d rather a l a r m i n g feature of I C . W h i l s t it is
obvious that the larger the m e m b e r s h i p of the U n i o n , the greater the
chance of our h a v i n g a confirmed k l e p t o m a n i a c i n our midst, this factor
alone does not account for even a significant proportion of thie petty d i s -
honesty w h i c h pervades this Institution.
So far this year there have been three major t h e f t s — t h e b r e a k i n g i n
to the Southside baggage r o o m a n d the theft of the t w o visiting girls' coats
from an attended c l o a k r o o m d u r i n g a H o p . A l l three c o u l d be attributable
to outside agencies. T h e P o w e r s T h a t B e accept this as the pleasantest
possibility a n d are b a c k i n g this theory. H o w e v e r attractive the theory is,
it does not account for the large n u m b e r of m i n o r thefts that l e d to the
r e m o v a l of the luggage racks near the lavatory in the U n i o n . T h e p r o b l e m
appears to be that a very large n u m b e r of people s i m p l y do not regard
t a k i n g a c o p y of F E L I X a n d not p a y i n g for it as theft. T h e same is true
of the newspapers a n d magazines in the U n i o n lounges. A n i n c r e d i b l e
q u a n t i t y of glasses have gone f r o m the bars. C u t l e r y a n d (heavens k n o w
w h y ) trays are stolen i n staggering amounts f r o m the refectories. Tools
regularly go missing f r o m labs, a n d workshops. A display F o r d engine was
recently p u t on display i n the M e c h . E n g . B u i l d i n g . N o w it has no
distributor cap or rotor a r m . E v e r y removable part has been removed.
O n e wonders w h a t state the Department's n e w rocket engine w i l l b e i n
b y the e n d of term. W h a t is the difference, except i n scale, between
stealing a car a n d stealing a glass f r o m the b a r ? T h e s i m p l e truth of
the matter is that it is still theft, still dishonest a n d costing b o t h the
U n i o n a n d the C o l l e g e a large a m o u n t of money. O f course, this doesn't
apply to y o u , you've only got one set ot M o o n e y cutlery, or one 01 Stan's
pint mags, auU so has the broke next door, so w h y shouldn't y o u ? S i m p l y
oecause tney are not your property a n d y o u are a tniet if y o u take t h e m ,
i i o o m searches w e r e seriously considered last year but not e a r n e d out as
they w e r e thought a n infringement of student freedom, something p r i z e d
very h i g h l y here. U n f o r t u n a t e l y petty t h i e v i n g has r e a c h e d s u c h a state
that there is a strong argument for the C o l l e g e A u t h o r i t i e s s a y i n g :
" F r e e d o m ? — b u t look w h a t y o u d o w i t h i t . "

The £72000 bill
t h e telephone scandal is a n obvious example of this attitude towards
someone else's property, w h e n someone else is a large institution. It is
dishonest to m a k e a local c a l l over a C o l l e g e 'phone w i t h o u t p a y i n g for
it if it is a private call. E v e r y o n e is aghast at the nerve of the gentle-
m a n w i t h tlie N o r w e g i a n g i r l - f r i e n d , but have y o u used a college p h o n e
for y o u r o w n purposes t
W h i l s t on the subject of the telephone business, e n o u g h of w h i c h is
said elsewhere, it is interesting to note thnt the late Rector said, i n the
O b s e r v e r colour supplement p u b l i s h e d at the b e g i n n i n g of this t e r m , that
one of the major advantages of h a v i n g the C o l l e g e i n the centre of
L o n d o n was t h a t : "It's the d i i l e r e n c e between a t r u n k c a l l a n d a l o c a l
c a l l . " Yes, i n d e e d !
