The Judo Club is in one of its
strongest positions for som*
years. The intake at Freshers
Day included 3 green, 4 orange
and 2 yellow belts and several
beginners, who now show con-
siderable promise. For the first
tme in five years the club has
a black belt—Vice Captain,
Keith Glover, was awarded one
earlier this term. Keith, 3rd
year Elec. Eng. is also Captain
of the U L U team.

IC Athletes unlucky
At the U L U Winter championships at Motspur Park on 16th
November the College failed by one point to capture the relay*
cup, losing it to U C who also gained the field events trophy, which
we had taken there with us—again we were runners up. Our usual
depleted team appeared but as most people competed in two or
even three events, relay teams were made up and the requirement
of two competitors per field event was fulfilled (the results of field
events depend on the aggregate of the two). We won two of the
jumps—the triple through Paul Jones and Chris Power and the
high with Mike Evans and captain Maicess Weaver who had lost
the opposition by the time they reached 5" 8".
S o m e expected points w e r e lost as D a v e D o w n i e w a s u n a b l e t o reach
