The need for money
Sir.
I n reply to the S C C Chairman a n d others, I woulc* point. Out that
other than piofit-makii.g organisation cannot afford to b e o v e r < :
about its sources of revenue.
Imperial College U n i o n guarantees that each issue of F E L I X w i l l be
of at K'4<t xO pages. A n y moneys trom advertising reduce i n c LurUen ua
i C U mvi release more tunas to the other activities which d e m a n d * t u b
tidy T h r u a left-wing advertiser may well allow a right-wing chit I
run its dinner I
In every issue F E L I X expresses its independence of the views of a d -
vertisers, etc. So, as l o n g as there is no question of legal liability on
the paper's part, from a purely financial viewpoint the Editor cannot
ignore such material as the Vietnam and Rhodesia advertisements.
The decision is his, not one for any Board of Directors. Their role is
to condemn h>m for f a i l i n g to make the paper pay through his refusal
of advertisements.
Finally, I would add that I disapprove of this form of advertising.
However, I also recognise that its economic advantages far outweigh any
moral disadvantages. A n d please credit the readers with a modicum of
mtclligence—4hey do meet such pressures in everyday life, so why not
also in F E L I X ? . Amen.

Free to do nothing
Listening to the protests ot certain members of R C S U that it might Iese
some if its autonomy in joining N U S or to the fears of certain members of
I C U that it may lose some of its freedom, one might be led to think
that we are a striving, active College. It would be misleading to think of
H C S Union, which for over a decade has been best described as a'sporting'
Union, as a forward thinking, dynamic organisation, and similarly the other
two constituent Unions.

—THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH
Dr. Leggett's talk to the Wells
Society on the subject of rein-
carnation was aimed mainly at pre-
senting the facts of the case, even
though he did introduce his own
hypothesis.
H e began b y q u o t i n g six cases o f
reincarnation (in h i s terms o f refer-

that have happened. F r i e n d s k i l l e d

same parents a f e w years later.
