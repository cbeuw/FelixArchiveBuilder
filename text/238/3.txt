U N Student Association
Model General Assembly
The Third Model General As-
sembly of the United Nations is on
its way. Church House, Westminster
will be turned into s scene of intense
'diplomatic' activities from 29 March
to 1 April, 1967 when more than
400 students from all over the
country will for a time change their
nationality to Cambodian or Mongol-
ian,..
After the overwhelming success of
the first two Assemblies—the only
ones of their kind i n Europe—held
in Cambridge i n 1964 and Oxford i n
1965 London agreed to p l a y host to
the third one and to turn it into a
major event in the national student
calender.
T h e Assembly is organised b y the
Unified Student Association of the
United Kingdom which is a national
student organisation with 10,000
members. A branch of the Association
exists in most universities and col-
leges in the country. Imperial C o l -
lege Interational Relations Club is
one such and a very active one « t
that. T h e 3-member Steering C o m -
mittee set u p by the National E x -
ecutive of U N S A consists of Imper-
ial College, L . S . E . and U . L . U . and
has 'been working since January this
year to organise the Model Assembly.
A l l member states of the United
Nations (121 all the latest count)
will be represented b y groups of
tour students from colleges and
universities throughout the country.
Three Resolutions
W h e r e v e r possible the 'delegates'
will not come f r o m the countries
they intend to represent, because
otherwise the process of learning
about that particular country will be
lost However, each delegation is
encouraged to have at least one
'adviser' f r o m the country they r e -
present to help on difficult matters.
Artist and
Camera
A b e emergence of photography i n
the nineteenth century brought
about a great change in the way i n
whicn painters looked at the world.
Xtae lnnuence of photography on art,
and vice versa, was discussed by M r .
J . L . Fagg A . K . P . S , at a joint meet-
ing of the photographic societies of
Chelsea College, the C o l l e g e of S t .
M a r k and St. J o h n , Queen Elizabeth's

After a general debate o n the w o r i o
situation three resolutions o n specific
topics will be discussed. These a r e :
a) T h e situation in South-East
Asia,
b) Economic Development,
c) Disarmament and Peace-keen-
ing.
T h e last afternoon will be spent on
discussing emergency resolutions.
Quite apart from the educational
aspect of the Assembly—the com-
plexities of international diplomacy,
work of the U . N . and the rest of
it—it is also a great social occassion
where so many students from all
parts of the country Bather—an op-
portunity hardly available otherwise.
Exhibition
In addition there will be a raijor
uieeuug on uie eve ot tue otnvifc'-
opening i n which the Foreign
Secretary \yill address the delegates.
A n exhibition of books on inter-
national Affairs will be run by a
group of publishers and a folk con-
cert will be held at the L y c e u m
Ballroom.
A l l these point to an exciting
student occassion in London i n the
Spring. Imperial College will repre-
sent 5 countries in the Assembly.

is asked to contact Nitin Som (Intern-
al 3288 or Keogh 385) or to come
