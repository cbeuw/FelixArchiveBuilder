JOAN LETTER AT oOC SOC
Joan Lester, the Labour MP f o r Eton and Slough, s a i d on Monday that i t was not
b l a t e n t r a c i a l i s t s that worried her but the subtle forms of d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
such as are found i n some i n d u s t r i e s i n t h i s country. Eer u l t i m a t e answer
to r a c i a l d i s c r i m i n a t i o n was to cut i t out as much as p o s s i b l e by l e g i s l a t i o n
and to educate c h i l d r e n to accept a m u l t i - r a c i a l society. 'We cannot t e l l
people what to t h i n k ,1
she s a i d , 'That would be quite wrong. But we can make
i t d i f f i c u l t f o r them to express themselves1
. T a l k i n g to the s o c i a l i s t Society,
she s a i d that she thought that Government p o l i c y i n Rhodesia was not aimed
at the submission of the omith regime. I f that were the case, she s a i d , f o r i c e
would have been used l o n g ago.

SIR,
The drimken bar-set ended the r e g u l a r -unday night f o l k - s i n g i n g i n the Union
Lounge vvith i t s rowdiness.
I t now seems that there are others ( i n f a c t , these probably number l e s s
than half-dozen) who are presumably Soccer-conscious and seem to f i n d no
greater pleasure than to deface the team n o t i c e s on the board outside tne bar
during t h e i r s p e l l of i n e b r i a t i o n i n ..ednesday and Sunday evenings.
They must be u t t e r l y s e l f i s h and f e e b l e as f a r as I can see. I d r i n k ,
but would never sink t h i s low, knowing that i t was someone e l s e ' s work I
was defacing.
Yours, J.E. C-arratt
