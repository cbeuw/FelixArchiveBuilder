SECHETAKX OP STATE FOR EDUCATION iJ® A X Ji. iRGriTB
In answer to questions from the f l o o r of NUS C o u n c i l , Mr Grosland s a i d that
the present Government had no i n t e n t i o n s of i n t r o d u c i n g a loans element as p a r t
of student grants, however he would not deny the p o s s i b i l i t y of t h e i r i n t r o d u c t i o n
by f u t u r e governments,
Mr Grosland addressed MS C o u n c i l on a wide range of educational matters:
About the expansion of higher education he s a i d that not only had. standards
been maintained but i n some d i r e c t i o n s they had been improved - f o r example the
student-staff r a t i o and b e t t e r student accommodation.
On student r i g h t s he thought there had to be a balance between students'
unions e l e c t i n g t h e i r v i c e - c h a n c e l l o r and ' f o u r - l e t t e r m i l i t a n c y ' , l i b e r a l i s m
of c o l l e g e government and a greater degree of c o n s u l t a t i o n between s t a f f and
students are more important than r e d r a f t i n g of c o n s t i t u t i o n .
Only a system of higher education which provided 1
a broad spectrum of
i n s t i t u t i o n s w i t h d i f f e r e n t f u n c t i o n s ' could prevent the s o c i a l i n j u s t i c e of the
d i v i s i o n s of courses i n t o degree courses and others.
' I t w i l l not improve my r e l a t i o n s h i p w i t h N U 3 ' « This was h i s r e p l y to
the NUS suggestion-of b l a c k l i s t i n g t r a i n i n g c o l l e g e s which run the 'Box and Cox'
system where students spend f i v e weeks at College and f i v e weeks at home a l t e r n a t e l y .
The i d e a was to send a l i s t of a l l such Colleges to s i x t h formers.

SIR
So much has been s a i d about NUS, i t s concessions and the advantages of being
represented i n i t that people seem to have f o r g o t t e n the b a s i c question: Should
RCS j o i n NUS, Have the gentlemen of RCS f o r g o t t e n that they are a l s o gentlemen
of IC. The Union was formed by three c o l l e g e s so as to strengthen each. Talk
of RCS, Guilds and L i n e s and one a u t o m a t i c a l l y a s s o c i a t e s them w i t h i n t e r n a l a f f a i r s .

a few people were i n t e r e s t e d i n membership, Mines Union would do nothing unless there
