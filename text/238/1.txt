V o t e to w i t h d r a w
from N U S c h a l l e n g e d
by C.G. Harrison
Load and prolonged applause followed the proposal speech by
ML J . Lack at the RCS Meeting last Tuesday. Though the speech-
es succeeding it put the many different aspects of die case for and
against NUS the result was predictable. Mr. Lack's motion, which
was carried, was in fact a negation of the one passed only two
weeks before instructing RCS Committee to apply for membership
of NUS. The speeches from the floor occupied almost all of the
one-and-a-quarter hours available and the meeting voted to ad-
journ until the following Thursday.
The meeting was opened by President Keith Cavanagh to a full,
though not packed house. Having completed the signing of the
minutes he produced a letter from the Dept. of Education and
Science (which had been questioned by the Union) regarding the
payment of NUS fees by local Education Authorities. The writer
claimed to be not entirely clear on the matter but stated that by
affiliating to NUS, RCS could claim to be providing a new service.
An increase in the Union fee due to this is permissible and would
be paid by the L E A .
Vice-President Dick Conn explain-
ed to t h e U n i o n the R C S plans for
collecting money for the Carnival
Charity w h i c h included the Chelsea-
Real Madrid m a t c h and a blockade
of the City o n the following Friday.
H e appealed for entrants and
spectators for t h e Swimming G a l a on
Friday 2nd. D e c e m b e r . Cavanagh
then proposed, t o a m e n d the agend?
so that L a c k ' s motion could be de-
bated first, since this could save
time.
Martin Lack opened his speech b y
refusing the "carrots" with which
R C S had been tempted at the last
meeting.
By his own m i t i g a t i o n s he had
discovered that N U S has no mono-
poly of the benefits i t offers its
members. Anyone can make use of
the Entertainments service, or of
Endsleigh Insurance—the n e w N U S
insurance bureau. H o w would join-
ing benefit R C S ? H e pointed out
that there,, are several other firms
offering cut-price travel—some of
them cheaper than N U S .
Would N U S be of use in national
affairs ? M r . Lack pointed out that
when I C Union organised the Loans
lobby of Parliament, N U S attempted
to dissuade them saying that they
believed the Ministry of Education
would drop it. Since then it has
been stated that it may well be
introduced in 1968.
Mr. Lack had spoken to the
Secretary of N U S and put it to him
that bit organisation really only serv-
ed colleges whose membership was
less than seven hundred. T h e
Secretary agreed on this point. R C S
however had excellent facilities and
excellent representation on College
committees. In fact, he said, the.
only situation in winch R C S Union-
would need N U S is one concerning a
national issue—and here N U S fails.
The motion was opposed by Paul
Fawcett who claimed that recently
R C S had been too insular, that its
members were forgetting that they
were also members of the student
body of tiie country. There was a
kind of pride in not being a mem-
ber of N U S . H e stated the aims of
the National Union of Students as
layed out in 1947. In the past N U S
had obtained grant increases and
prevented an increase i n the Hall
ot Residence fees, and although N U S
was not always completely successful
in its dealings with the Government,
he thought that R C S U was allowing
it to step in and save money for
its students without doing anything
to help N U S .
Mr. Fawcett displayed several
N U S pamphlets; he explained that

it published about a dozen of these
each year to deal with specific
student problems. T o contribute the
knowledge possessed by R C S U as
a technological institution, the Union
needed to join N U S . T h e Union had
in fact an obligation to join in order
to share its scientific experience. It
needed to join in order that N U S
might consider problems which
needed putting to the Government
on its behalf.
A short and rather ineffective
speech was m a d e by the seconder
for the proposition. H e stated, with-
out evidence, that this year N U S
has done nothing and asked if the
Union would waste m o n e y by joining
such a body.
T h e second speaker in opposition
described the comprehensive studies
made by N U S on student problems.
These were made by consulting
every college—a method that could
not be used b y R C S U or I C U . A s
for finance—if the money was to
come from L E A , then R C S U would
not lose anything and by joining
W o u l d gain a voice on N U S Council.
This would be of importance in
technological issues.
Floor Speeches
Speeches were then invited for
a n d against the motion. Several
interesting items were brought out
and many points of order raised in
a heated debate. T h e case of R C S
was compared to that of the
University of Keele, which is of a
similar size. Keele had complained
that it was not given a say because
of the system of voting used.
As a non-political b o d y N U S has
refused to take up the Prices and
Incomes Standstill with the Govern-
ment, yet it is a m e m b e r o f the
International Students Conference—
a highly political body. It was, how-
ever, unable to vote on 95p.c. of the
motions.
One simple yet important point
was raised by M . J . Tait who question-
ed R C S Union joining N U S , since
surely I C Union should deal with
matters outside the College. This
was well received.
Paul Fawcett summed up for the
opposition, saying that N U S did ob-
tain concessions for students and that
these would be available for the use
of the Union, N U S can give advice
and legal aid where necessary. M r .
Fawcett finished by saying that R C S U
needs N U S and needs R C S U .
In his summing up Martin Lack
quoted a figure obtained recently
by inspecting N U S files. H e had
found that only 9p.c. of I C U are
members of N U S , i.e. 330 out of
3500. H e pointed out its inability
to deal with important national is-
sues and that its services were i n
general, duplicated by other organ-
isations or available to all students.
Ballot
A paper ballot was taken and
whilst these were counted the
President passed on to A n y Other
Business. As it was nearly 2.30 p.m.
many members left after the ballot
and when M r . Fuchs challenged the
vote it was decided that it was not
practicable to hold another ballot.
T h e final figures, after a recount,
were F o r : 163; Against: 143 and
1 abstention.
M r . fuens pointed out. tnat tne
application t o i N U S had been made
a u u a witnoiawai could only follow
an r v o S U Committee meeting. H e
suggested tnat six visitors s h o u l d be
senc to the Margate conference on
friday to explain why R C S U h a d
been withdrawn, but this was not
ruled o n by Cavanagh..
A d jo urnment
I n view of the time and the fact
that M r . T i m Doe's motion, regard-
ing a referendum, was still to be
debated, it was decided to adjourn
the meeting until Thursday 24th.
The meeting adjourned with a
Kangela..
