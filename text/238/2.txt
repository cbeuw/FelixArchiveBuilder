RCS row continues
O n the admission of President Keith Cavanagh, the Union meeting held
on Tuesday was adjourned in chaos. At the t i m e of adjourning M r . Frank
Fud-'., w i t h other students, was challenging t h e vote which had just
bet.; taken on the motion that R C S U should withdraw from N U S . At
that meeting the President had not ruled on the challenge to the vote and
his first move on Thursday was to rule that a revote be not granted. This
ruling was then challenged and Cavanagh quitted the chair in order to
take part in the debate. T h e Vice-President Dick Conn took the chair.
It was stated taut accusations h a d
been m a d e m a t certain persons h a u
completed m o r e than o u t ballot slip.
A l least one s u c h person h a d been

T h e h o l d i n g of tnis ballot w a s quest-
i o n e d a n d the H o n . S e c . Jeffrey
W a r r e n stated that methods of vot-
i n g were not c o v e r e d b y t h e c o n -
stitution.
Revote
T h e result of the ballot was that
the m o t i o n : that a revote be taken
on the motion debated at the pre-
vious meeting, r e c e i v e d F o r 143 a n d
A g a i n s t 156. It followed that the
m o t i o n that R C S withdraw from
N U S w a s carried.
T h e rest of the meeting was con-
cerend with the motion tabled by
Messrs. Doe and Needham that " T h e
vote taken on N U S was not truly
representative arid that a ballot be
taken throughout RCS". Mr. Doe
seated *** motion without elaborat-
ing on u aud a, speaker-against was
called. Tnis was Martin Lack who
explained that the motion was tabl-
ed Hurriedly after the first N U S de-
bate at w u i c u they felt that more
time lor consideration was needed
ana more tacts should be presented
to the members of the Union. Since
then there had been considerable
publicity and anyone at all inter-
ested in the issue would have at-
tended the meeting on Tuesday,
therefore it would be pointless to
hold a r e f e r e n d u m in order that un-
interested parties might vote.
Ballot
At this point M r . Boothman pro-
posed to amend to the motion.
During the time following the tabl-
ing of the motion it had lost much
of its relevance and he was there-
fore proposing an amendment which
had been agreed on b y M r . Doe.
T h e amendment r e a d : " T h e R C S
Union instructs its General Commit-
tee to take a ballot throughout the
whole College to determine the
wishes of the Union on affiliation to
N U S and instructs its General C o m -
mittee to act in accordance with
its wishes". M r . Boothman explained
that it was intended to delete the
first clause o f the original motion
a n d to include much of the second.

Modem developments in the Generating Board such as Advanced Gas Cooled
Reactors and the 400 kV transmission supergrid require graduates of the highest
calibre. Our graduate training schemes are intended for mechanical and electrical
engineers and honours physicists who are interested in a career in operational
aspects of the Board's work.
The Board is carrying out a number of research programmes closely related to its
engineering interests. These include such topics as plasma physics, aerodynamics,
combustion studies, stress and vibration analysis, heat transfer, erosion and
corrosion studies, materials research and reactor physics.
Research careers are available . . .
