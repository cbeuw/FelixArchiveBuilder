T h e h i g h rate of thefts at I m p e r -
ial C o l l e g e continues unabated this
year, reports M r , J. H e n r y , C h i e f
Security Officer of the C o l l e g e ,
H o w e v e r , although the level of
thefts remains h i g h , it has not risen
over the last few years.
M r . H e n r y lays the b l a m e for t h a
high rate of thefts squarely 00 the
students; the laxity w i t h w h i c h they
take care of their percon?) rw s e s -
sions provides the opportunity f i r
thefts to occur. W a l l e t s c o n t a i n i n g
large sums of m o n e y are k i t
casually i n mo h u n g o n racks;
jackets a n d briefcases are left l y i n g
unattended next to doors a n d i n
corridors. F r e s h e r undergnt ' j a t e s
particularly have a naive assurance
about the safety of t h e n possessions,
apparently u n a w a r e that the C o l l e g e
exists i n a large city.
Naivety, however, does not apnear
to be the sole reason for neglect of
persona! possessions, Postgraduates
a n d staff members, a l t h o u g h w a r n -
e d numerous times continue to . be
the worst offenders i n l e a v i n g their
possessions l y i n g around.
Union Racks
A s k e d w h y the racks for coats a n d
hats i n the U n i o n h a d recently been
removed, the C h i e f Security Officer
replied that after the first hop of the
term several complaints w e r e re-
ceived about the removal of coats.
After consultation w i t h the Presid-
ent of the U n i o n it was d e c i d e d to
remove the rack as clothing h u n g
there c o u l d not be continually ob-
served and consequently was n o t
safe. T h e r e exist facilities in all
buildings for "banking' coats, hats,
umbrellas a n d briefcases. L o c k e r s
should always be used or possessions
m a y be h a n d e d to appropriate at-
are provided, w l u l e a r.otice u n d e r -
bizarre sitoation occurs where racks
are p r o v i d e d , w h i l e a notice u n d e r -
neath b l a n d l y Wains students not to
use thein; apparently there is n o
attendant l a 11 Prince's Gardens to
keep an eye on the rack.
hi the b i l l i a r d room of the U n i o n ,
posters h a v e been placed w a r n i n g
people to keer> their valuables w i t h
t h e m . Ironically these posters have
r o w been stolen (since replaced)—
one can only conclude by souvenir-
happy students.
P r e v e n t i o n
B e t t e r T h a n
C u r e
M r . Henry gave a very serious
warning to students—prevention ia
better than cure. D o not leave waU
lets and loose cash lying around*
even in coats and briefcases. Use
the lockers provided and not the
racks for all possessions. It is not
necessary to use a wallet—it is
preferable really to keep valuables
in your trouser pockets. At all times
take great care of your possessions
—thieves do exist.

Y H A Group in
Peak District
The Peak District National Park
lies south of a line drawn between
Sheffield and Manchester, but its
dissimilarity from these cities is com-
plete, as IC-Bedford Youth Hostel
group discovered over the weekend
ll-13th November.
After travelling up by coach the
group of almost forty went on
modest hiking tours of parts of the
area in three groups. T h e country-
side is mainly open moorland, with
a few towns of some size, but
mostly scattered villages and small
towns, often with factories.
T h e weather is generally overcast
and can be misty, over a landscape
of grey stone walls and some wood-
ed valleys.
Among other places, we saw
Castleton, with the ruined Peveril
Castle standing high above it, and
the Ladybower Reservoir. The
coach and hostel were subjected to
prolonged sing-songs. W e look for-
ward to coming weekend trips to
Yorshire and the Lake District.

Beer Prices Increase?
Beer prices in the Union may have to be increased. That was
one ef the conclusions reached by the Refectory Committee at their
first meeting this session. Despite last year's profit of £780,
because of price rises by the brewers, which have not been passed
on, and because of the employment of two extra barmen, the bar
will make a considerable loss this year unless drink prices are
put up.
This price increase was actually
agreed last session, but because of
doubts whether it fell within the
Prices and Incomes standstill, it was
not put into effect. It is now con-
sidered that because an increase
would be due to increases by the
suppliers, the freeze has no effect.
However, because of the unpopular-
ity of this move, the Committee de-
cided after discussion that the
position should be investigated
further and the increase only i m -
plemented if there is no other method
of avoiding a loss on the bars. Th e
probable increases would be 2d a
pint on draught beer, and Id a pint
on bottled beer.
Accounts
H i e main recommendation of the
Catering Sub-Committee in their re-
port was the speeding-up of tihe
addition of snack-bar facilities to
the main dining-hall, it was thought
desirable that the change shoulcfc be
made much sooner. T h e installation
of movable counters and necessary
equipment will cost about £ 1 7 5 , and
the alteration will be treated
initially as an experiment.
The Refectory Committee were
well satisfied with the Catering ac-
counts which showed a loss of only
£ 1 6 3 on a turnover of nearly
£166,000 despite price increases in
food which were not passed on, and
congratulated Mr. Mooney on his
efforts.
The Wine Committee reported in-
crease in consumption of vintage
wines from reserve stock, and so
decided to continue its policy of
purchasing good vintages. It also
reported that after a visit from the
Weights and Measures Deparment,
it was agreed that the College Bars
did not fall within the Acts, thus
avoiding the considerable cost of
getting glasses approved by the
authorities. O n the subject of glas-
ses, it was reported that breakages
and loss of glasses from the College
bars, so far this term, had cost
about £ 1 5 0 .
The main item to be set against
the Refectory Reserve Account,
which now has a balance of just
over £7.000. is the cost of the
Crush-hall Bar, which is nearly
£1,300. It was also agreed that
£ 2 0 0 shoulH be spent from the Re-
serve Account on purchasing extra
places of silver, and that 3 more
candelabra should be bought, one oi
which would deplace the candelabra
that M r . Mooney lost to Metallurgy
about two years ago- Two new cof-
fee machines have also been pur-
chased for the Union, at a maximum
cost of about £ 7 5 . Complaints about
the quality of the coffee from older
machines are being investigated.
Complaints officers have also been
appointed, and these are Mr. R.
Lewis for South Side and Mr. D .
Harris for the Union.
