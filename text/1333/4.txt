on third-generation solar cells.
This design is expected to become
prevalent as the world’s everyday
solar panel. Third-generation solar
cells, or Quantum Well Solar Cells
(QWSCs), have the potential to be
cheaper, more versatile and, as
Tibbits is preparing to demonstrate,
more efficient than any other single-
junction solar cell in existence.
The basic principle of solar cells is
that when radiation hits a particular
class of material known as a semi-
conductor, electrons in this material
are excited and released from their
normal position, or ‘hole’. If you can
trap these electrons before they fall
down again, it is possible to store
reach of the average homeowner,
despite potential savings in the long
run. But then, if the leader of our
country believes this issue to be so
important, where are the billions of
pounds of investment?
Professor Barnham believes there
are several possible reasons for this,
but pinning them down is difficult
and speculative. Investment is split
between a wide range of technolo-
gies vying for attention. That’s why
he is overseeing research designed
to make solar the obvious choice.
Tom Tibbits, a former student of
Professor Barnham and now a con-
sultant at the Centre for Integrated
Photonics, is currently working
charge and thus create a voltage,
which generates electrical current.
Third-generation solar cells have
several advantages over earlier
designs. They use semiconductor
material that allows the use of a
wider range of radiation from the
sun, reducing wasted energy. Also,
because the active, light-absorbing
region is just 3 millionths of a metre
thick, they can be manufactured into
very thin, and therefore cheap, lay-
ers.
QWSCs are formed by combining
the semiconducting layer with other
layers that provide the electrical
contacts and anti-reflective coat-
ings. A concentrator is then used to
focus light from a wide area onto the
active region of the cell.
The efficiency of solar cells is
measured by the ratio of energy
that hits the cell to the energy it
generates. At present, the efficiency
world record is 27.6%, achieved by
the Spire Corporation back in 1991.
Tibbits is preparing to test his devic-
es over the next few months and is
confident of breaking the 28% mark.
The danger is the ever-present
threat of being overtaken by com-
petitors in Japan and the United
States, who are working on similar
projects with bigger budgets.
On a wider scale, however, this
kind of competition is good news.
Many ideas are around to develop
these devices into marketable prod-
ucts. One possibility is the ‘smart-
windows’, mentioned by Tony Blair.
Windows incorporating material that
is capable of both shielding us from
sunlight and generating electric-
ity from it will provide clean energy
and reduce our need for it and stop
the insane practise of drawing the
blinds to turn on the lights.
While we still have light years
to travel before we can ban fossil
fuels, at least we have a direction. It
appears that burning fossil fuels is
not a necessity in an industrialised
society. There is a growing senti-
ment that we can and should keep
hold of the freedoms that technol-
ogy has given us, but the habit-
ability of our planet must obviously
be a priority. If we are prepared to
invest both financially and politi-
cally, it should be possible to live in
a developed world without changing
the make-up of our planet.

Imperial to become world
leader in solar energy

State Group and reports on the potential of third-generation solar cells.

Tracing tRNA’s dance
Scientists have employed the
sixth fastest computer in the
world to simulate how the
ribosome accurately constructs
proteins. Although the techni-
cal achievement has shattered
the previous record for biologi-
cal simulation, ribosome spe-
cialists are wary of the study’s
conclusions. Because of limita-
tions in computing power, the
simulation had to occur tens of
millions of times faster than it
occurs naturally within the cell.
Birds v. windmills battle
heads to California courts
Two environmental groups
have gone to court with the
aim of shutting down the farm
at Altamont Pass, CA for three
months during the migra-
tion season to help protect
red-tail hawks, golden eagles,
and other raptors killed by
the mills. The nearly 6,000
windmills on the rolling hills of
Altamont Pass, 60 miles east of
San Francisco, make up one of
the largest wind farms in the
country.
Red Planet comes close
to Earth
Mars had a close encounter
with Earth, approaching to
within 69.4 million km of our
planet in the early hours of
Sunday. Conditions were cloudy
over most of the UK, meaning
amateur astronomers had dif-
ficulty seeing the planet. Mars
will not swing this close to
Earth for another 13 years.
I
’m not the only one concerned
about global warming. As Tony
Blair warned last year, global
warming poses “a challenge
so far-reaching in its impact
and irreversible in its destructive
power, that it alters radically human
existence”.
Whether you think human exist-
ence will be altered or not, there is
now a consensus that greenhouse
gas emissions are changing our cli-
mate, and with this summer’s hurri-
canes, melting ice, floods and more
hurricanes, there is greater urgency
in the question, ‘What can be done?’
Encouragingly, for many scientists
the question is not so much ‘What
can be done?’ but ‘Why aren’t we
doing it?’
Professor Keith Barnham of the
Experimental Solid State Group at
Imperial is a leading advocate of
solar energy. He thinks that tech-
nologies capable of satisfying our
energy needs without polluting the
atmosphere already exist.
The sun is a power station of unim-
aginable scale. “The radiation which
falls on buildings in this country is
seven times greater than the elec-
tricity used within them.” Therefore,
covering just a fraction of buildings
in reasonably efficient solar cells
would remove entirely the need for
conventional energy sources.
While Professor Barnham believes
that other alternatives such as wind
and wave power will all play a role
in the energy budget, solar energy
presents several key advantages.
Firstly, as the sun shines every-
where, electricity can be produced in
ample supply at the location where
it is required, reducing the need
for inefficient power lines stretch-
ing hundreds of miles. Secondly,
solar panels can be incorporated
into building design, and so do not
require large scale infrastructure
of their own. And thirdly, because
our energy consumption is greatest
during the day, solar energy produc-
tion matches our usage patterns, so
storage is less of a problem.
Thus we may well ask: if solar pan-
els are the solution to global warm-
ing, why are they not everywhere
already? Why are we still talking
about nuclear power and natural
gas? Crucially, the cost of install-
ing solar panels puts them out of
“While we still have
light years to travel
before we can ban
fossil fuels, at least we
have a direction.”
Blue-sky thinking: Tom Tibbits is attempting to create the world’s best
single-junction solar cell. Inset: a single cell, pictured with a 5 pence
piece. Arrays of these could meet future energy needs.
“The radiation falling on
buildings in this country
is seven times greater
than the electricity used
within them.”
