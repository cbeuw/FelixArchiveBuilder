Stewart Halforty, the President of
the University of London Union
resigned this week citing insur-
mountable differences with the way
ULU is managed.
Halforty told Felix; he “didn’t want
to waste a year being a figurehead
unable to change anything... I’ve
got a degree to finish”. He dislikes
the fact that “the manager of ULU
is controlled by the University of
London, not the President of the
Union. I’ve ended up as just a fig-
urehead”
He doesn’t think ULU “can con-
tinue in its present state, it has to
be managed by the elected officers”.
He decided to resign as it would be
“the best way to get his message
across”.
Halforty will not be replaced,
instead the role will be split between
the three remaining Deputy
Presidents. He will now return to
his studies at Goldsmiths, after a
two and a bit year Hiatus (he has
already held sabbatical positions at
Goldsmiths, including President).
“I would shoot my gay son”
Meanwhile, in a separate matter,
Luca Manfredi, ULU Council Chair,
faces the threat of a no confidence
motion as a result of homophobic
remarks. Manfredi, who is also the
General Secretary of UCL, posted
his view of homosexuality and gay
marriage on a UCL Union web-
notice board last November.
Most notably he said that if a
future son introduced him to his
boyfriend he would “take out a big
gun and make sure he [would] not
dishonour my family”.
At a recent ULU Council meeting,
Manfredi was asked to answer for
his previous comments. Manfredi
twice interrupted Jason Peachy, of
the ULU LGBT, who read out some
of Manfredi’s comments.
Manfredi has since issued an
apology in which he states “The
comments do not reflect my opin-
ion in any way. I distance myself
from them totally and uncondition-
ally. The comments were intended
for use against one very restricted
group of people.”
Although the comments were
made before he took up his cur-
rent position speculation abounds
that a motion of no confidence will
be brought against him at the next
ULU Council meeting. In the inter-
im Manfredi will not chair any ULU
meetings.
Manfredi also personally apolo-
gised to James Peachy for inter-
rupting “I pushed the ‘override’ but-
ton inappropriately at Council by
muting Jason. I reputed the matter
of extreme importance and there-
fore thought it should be discussed
at length [after council]. However,
I acted in an entirely inappropriate
way”
Stewart Halforty, ULU president
told Felix, “He should apologise
profusely and prostrate himself in
front of Council”. Sarah Khatib, ICU
Deputy President (Education and
Welfare) told Felix she thought “it
was inappropriate to publish. He
should have apologised at the time,
but he has apologised now and that
should be fine. We can’t dwell too
much on the past”. She did not com-
ment as to how she would vote if a
no confidence motion were brought
at the next ULU council.

On 7 November, the new ‘Southside
Bar’ will open in the ground floor
of Linstead Hall. The new name
has not been confirmed. Ordinarily,
this would be an occasion to rejoice
- a victory for the small people!
However, what has not gone unno-
ticed is that somewhere the plans
have been changed. Anybody who
cares to look inside the building site
will see the plans dictate not a bar,
but a licensed cafe with shop kiosk.
This suggests that the College has,
once again, gone behind the back of
the students.
In a meeting last term which
included Tobias Dalton (Real Ale
society chairman), former union
president Mustafa Arif, and College
representatives, it was agreed that
the ground floor of Linstead Hall
be the new home for what was the
Southside Bar. Plans were pro-
duced at the meeting, which clearly
showed a bar with the possibility
of some food services, but no shop.
At the end of this meeting, College
and student representatives were
in unanimous agreement regard-
ing these changes. Yet now, what
is being built is far removed from
the bar that was originally agreed.
The College has gone back on its
agreement between the end of last
term and now, clearly when the stu-
dents, either ensconced in exams or
away for the holidays, were unable
to respond.
Despite the Real Ale Society hav-
ing campaigned tirelessly for ‘a quiet
alternative to the Union,’ it seems
that the college has ordered a rep-
lica of da Vinci’s. The whole purpose
of the “Save Our Southside” cam-
paign was to gain a replacement bar
unlike those already provided - this
the petition clearly stated, and this
was therefore clearly demanded by
the members of Imperial College
who signed it. Once again, the
College seems to think it knows us
better than we do.
Felix made enquiries regard-
ing this discrepancy and received
numerous responses from a repre-
sentative. However, in one response,
a mention is made of ‘student rep-
resentatives’ having been at this
meeting, at which it is claimed plans
for the licensed cafe were agreed
- If this alludes to the meeting
involving Tobias Dalton et al, this
is quite simply not true. In a later
response, mention is made of the
single ‘elected student representa-
tive,’ ie Mustafa Arif. This suggests
two things - either that the College
wishes to deny the agreement that
was made in the first meeting, or
that further meetings were held
after the agreement was made.
It should be noted that Mr Dalton
was called into this first meeting as
an auxiliary student representative,
since certain College representa-
tives said they did not trust Mr Arif
to remain true to what he had said
in a meeting held previously. In this
earlier meeting, which included four
members of the Real Ale Society
and Mr Arif, it was agreed that there
was a need to replace the Southside
Bar, and that Mr Arif was to go for-
ward with this to the College.
A petition, signed by 4,000 mem-
bers of Imperial College who made
the effort to sign during the exam
period proves that a second bar was
wanted.

to students involved.
When the question of the possi-
bility of TfL
’s summary rejection
of applications as a money mak-
ing scheme was put to the Mayor
of London, Ken Livingstone, at the
London Assembly, he assured us
that “TfL is not using the processing
fee as a means of generating income
… [upon rejection of an applica-
tion] references are always given to
that part of the application which is
defective”. He also mentioned that
specific complaints would be given
careful attention.
Mel Chapman (Tickets Initiatives
Manager for TfL) mentioned that
“over 300,000 applications are proc-
essed per annum” and “the appli-
cation process must be as quick
and streamlined as possible”, before
mentioning that “the stamped signa-
ture differs quite significantly from
the sample supplied”. However,
after complaints from the Registry
Office, he conceded that the appli-
cations had been wrongly refused,
and agreed to issue Student Oyster/
Photocards against the rejected
applications, adding the caveat that
TfL “would not be liable for any
adult rate fares paid by students in
the interim”.
