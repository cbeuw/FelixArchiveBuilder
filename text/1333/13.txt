I’ve had enough American music
shoved down my throat that if I
hear another 25 year old mother’s
boy ‘punk rocker’ crying about how
he used to be bullied at school I
might seriously consider moving to
Iceland, where I can enjoy Björk
all on my own with a couple of
fish. Sadly the lumbering chains of
oppression (or student loans if you
want to get all ‘technical’) keep me
walking in this green and pleasant
land. So I’m gonna have to stick with
the Audio Bullys, who are so English
they make Pete Doherty look like an
American tourist trying to come to
grips with the Underground.
So what better why to start off an
Audio Bully’s concert than to stand
in the rain? This is not recommend-
ed if you are currently trying to
recover from Fresher’s Flu, which
you caught during a necking session
with one of those weird and particu-
larly ugly engineers during a hazy
evening down the Union. So special
guest and first on the decks, John
Vick, had a tough job for himself. His
mix was somewhat minimalist and
hard-hitting but got people moving
early on. His continual use of inter-
ruptions of the perpetuum mobile
was arousing but a good use of vari-
ation on beat and melody made for
the right effect.
Now for the juicy bit. Simon Franks
quickly forged an electric connec-
tion with the audience with a once-
over of the summer smash ‘Shot You
Down’ and set off into a trip through
their new album ‘Generation’ with
an extremely dynamic take on every
track provided by the mysterious
new programmer due to the absence
of Tom Dinsdale.
Simon’s lyrics punched home the
most English aspects of life; getting
stoned, taking pills and nicking shit,
during All Sing Along. Combined
with his speaking-not-singing style,
this makes for a real contrast. With
such a wide range of voices, surely
he could use more than one in a
song?
The set also provided a few gems
in the form of The Prodigy’s Out Of
Space and a mash up of Generation
with Grandmaster Flash’s classic
White Lines. He finally ended the
set with version of Shot You Down
that sounded as if Simon had con-
tracted the largest stutter know to
mankind.
True to form the Bullys created
killer hooks and riffs that kept me
scaring people on the tube all week.
However, their heavy use of glis-
sando (build ups) became expected
and by the end was no longer spe-
cial. The clever use of silent inter-
ruptions built a tower of climax so
grand I swear I had an orgasm.
Sick of American gunk? Well, the
Audio Bullys are back and ready to
get down, right dirty and British.
Drop your steak and kidney pie and
have a listen or watch, if you’re feel-
ing flush.

I found myself last night in a
packed-out King’s College Union
waiting for one of the most hyped
bands since The Kaiser Chiefs.
Having only heard one or two
Morning Runner songs, like many
others I was waiting to be impressed
- with the rumors circulating about
the band and their huge supporting
roles for Coldplay and Athlete, how
could you not be?
After a good warm-up by support-
ing acts The Holloways and The
Race, the crowd were ready for a
great show and surged towards the
stage as Morning Runner came on
to a round of applause so huge it
probably burst a few ear drums.
They then spent their opening ten
minutes whipping the crowd into a
frenzy with three songs so pleasing
everyone was soon dancing along,
including one girl in the front row
who seemed to be having some kind
of fit. The frenzied fast paced music
fitted perfectly with the almost sei-
zure inducing light show that really
got everyone into the gig.
The decision to slow things down
for a few songs was well received
as they played their first song ever
released on Faith And Hope, enti-
tled Oceans. The song is slow and
almost entirely vocal - a definite
winner, with the whole crowd sway-
ing along. Again with a light show
that really set the mood, King’s
seemed to turn into a perfect blue
ocean. They kept the crowd happy
by retaining the chilled mood with
the first song they wrote together, in
a scout hut nonetheless.
Pleasing a crowd is clearly a
breeze for Morning Runner as they
move into flawless renditions of
their singles, Be All You Want To Be
and Gone Up In Flames, with huge
cheers from the entire crowd. These
being practically the only released
Morning Runner songs around, they
induced big sing-alongs and the
whole crowd seemed to be chanting
lyrics back at Matthew Greener.
Morning Runner clearly have
learned a great deal on their sup-
porting tours, pulling off this show
with effortless ease. They know
exactly what to play, keeping the
crowd entertained and show that
they would be at home playing any
venue, large or small. Their upcom-
ing album will certainly be one to
watch out for.

Death Cab For Cutie - I adore this band, but that new single is utter tripe.
Morning Runner - the new Coldplay. Or is it the new Arcade Fire? I forget. Damn you, NME!

SINGLE REVIEWS
There are some things you just
shouldn’t listen to when you’ve
got a headache: pneumatic drills,
Decapitated, Celine Dion. Now, I’m
not saying that Mendeed inflict that
kind of pain, but they do their best:
and, throbbing temples aside, it’s a
good thing.
Taken from their forthcoming
second album, Beneath A Burning
Sky combines high-speed thrash
guitars and manic drumming with
piercing death-metal growling and
the occasional widdling guitar solo
that wouldn’t look out of place on a
Metallica album. On the evidence of
this single, they have stepped away
from the more classical elements
of their first album into a harder
style less tailored to the cross-over
crowd, which will raise their pro-
file no end among the elitist, trOO
metal set. Inventive, tight and hun-
gry, Mendeed have the potential to
go far. Now, where did I put that
ibuprofen?

Nu-metal is dead. As dead as Dave
Williams of Drowning Pool, or Wes
Borland’s participation in Limp
Bizkit. If only it would stop walking
around and trying pathetically to
terrify us, like a zombie puppy, we
could all rest easily. Sadly, Disturbed
don’t seem to understand this.
You’ve probably heard Disturbed’s
most famous single, Down With
The Sickness. This is that, but less
enjoyably stompy. It’s even got that
irritating “wa-a-a-a” thing they do,
only they’ve managed to subdue it
until it sounds like a suicidal play-
boy’s last attempt to convince peo-
ple he’s enjoying the party. Stricken
is dull and pointless, recycling the
tired old conventions of its tired old
genre with complete complacency;
the shouted, mock-profound lyrics,
world-weary dirty guitars and self-
righteous bile have all been done
before, and no one wants to listen
to it. The only really positive thing I
can say about this is that I’d rather
listen to Stricken than to anything
by, say, Good Charlotte. Don’t even
get me started on Good Charlotte.

Apparently, I’m supposed to have
heard of Death Cab For Cutie (yes,
yes you should! - ed.). After five
albums, that’s probably not a tall
order, but I have to confess that I
haven’t. So I apologise if I get them
wrong, or ‘misunderstand’ them
– they strike me as the kind of band
whose fans make that kind of accu-
sation. Here goes.
Soul Meets Body is taken from
DCFC’s first major-label album,
Plans. It’s a tuneful ballad with a
simple melody, cheerful in a gentle
sort of way and completely unre-
markable.
The vocalist sounds as if his voice
hasn’t broken yet, the lyrics sound
as if they would probably sound very
deep if you were half-asleep and it’s
bland to the point of nausea, but
it’s faintly catchy in a Simon and
Garfunkel sort of way. I can tell the
refrain will be stuck in my head for
hours, but I’m not sure whether I’m
happy about that. I really can’t tell
whether I like this or not; it’s really
that lacklustre.
I’m sure it will be an enormous
hit.
