A
fraid to buy things online?
Wonder who’s watching
you at an ATM? The cosy
yet modern setting of the
Dana Centre was the
place to be this week if you wanted
to protect yourself from the new
wave of crime that has hit us hard
this decade: cyber-crime.
On Tuesday 25 October, the Centre
hosted one if its usual evening events
– but with a twist. It was not a single
speaker dictating to you but instead
a panel of experts from the field
combined with interactive remote
controls for audience participation.
The panel included Detective
Chief Inspector of the economic
and specialist crime unit for the
Metropolitan Police, Stuart Dark,
crime researchers Emily Finch and
Stefan Falinski from UEA and the
University of Leeds, and McAfee
representatives Greg Day and Jack
Clark. The panel gave a compre-
hensive view of just how many ways
criminals can get to you without you
having the slightest clue!
The night started with a selection
of questions geared at the audience:
Have you been affected by cyber-
crime? Which do you think is saf-
est out of telephones, internet and
Switch cards? Which of these do you
feel is least safe? This was where
the ‘ask the audience’-style remotes
came in use.
Over 60% of the audience said
they felt the internet was not safe
Have you been stolen?
to make purchases over or do their
banking with. What do you think?
Over 30% of the audience had also
been affected by cyber-crime or
identity theft in the past.
Approximately £1.3 billion pounds
a year is lost through cyber-crime.
Did you know it is not illegal to
have more than one identity in the
UK? It only becomes illegal when
you use false identities to commit
crime. Did you also know that the
way a large proportion of thieves
get your details is via internet cha-

trooms? They see what rooms you
use and pretend they want to know
you. When is your birthday? How old
are you? I’m in London, how about
you? All normal questions, but they
now know your date of birth and
area you live in. This was the kind of
insight given at the event.
The university researchers
explained how they had stepped into
the shoes of these criminals and
even spoken to current criminals to
get an insight. They have used each
other’s credit cards many times and
have easily been able to look and
learn other people’s pins at check-
outs and cashpoints. If you have
worked in a shop before, I’m sure
you know that most sales assistants
never really look at the signatures
on peoples cards – criminals thrive
on this; they pretend not to know
their pin and ask to sign for the
goods they buy.
So what was the message sent
out at the event? Watch your back!
Make sure no one is within viewing
distance when you enter your pin
anywhere. Shred your bank state-
ment and receipts before binning
them – these scum are happy to rifle
through your garbage. Check your
accounts regularly for any unusual
transactions and, last but not least,
always check the full identity of call-
ers if they ask you for any personal
information or passwords. Basically,
they are everywhere – on the streets,
on the phone and online!
B
SE, foot-and-mouth dis-
ease, SARS and, most
recently, bird flu. Every
year there is a new lead
story in the newspa-
pers that makes the world seem
as though it were becoming a risk-
ier place to live. On the evening of
27 October, a panel at the Royal
Institution of Great Britain led a
discussion on the issue of how risk
should be assessed and interpolat-
ed, especially by the government
and the media.
“We now live in a culture that
has a proclivity to exaggerate every-
thing,” said Bill Durodié, professor
at Cranfield University.
The remainder of the panel con-
sisted of Elliot Morley MP
, Minister
of State for Climate Change and
Environment; Mary Riddell, a
columnist for The Observer; and
Matthew Wright, a Channel 5 pre-
senter. Sheena McDonald, an award-
winning broadcast journalist and
presenter, chaired the discussion.
Most of the panel agreed that both
the media and the government had
probably exaggerated the risk of
bird flu. According to these jour-
nalists and politicians, there was
no guarantee that the virus would
mutate to become capable of per-
son-to-person infection.
“I’m more worried about dying in
a car crash to tell you the truth,”
Risky business
Wright said.
Morley was quick to point out, how-
ever, that as a government official
you have to “think the unthinkable”
in order to protect the people. The
government has to pay attention to
the ‘what-ifs’ – making contingency
plans and informing the public of
the danger – because, as shown with
BSE, there is more danger in not
taking the risk seriously enough.
But why does fear seem to be
more prevalent now than in the
past? “Why does the world seem like
a riskier place to live?” an audience
member asked.
According to Durodié, people now
live in a state of isolation. Traditional
networks are breaking down, leav-
ing people to face the world on their
own. It’s the difference between the
feelings you have walking down a
dark street in the middle of the night
with a group of friends and the feel-
ings you have in the same situation
when you are by yourself, Durodié
said.
Amber Bauer attends a debate on the portrayal of risk.
Riddell said that a declining belief
in God and an afterlife was partially
responsible. Many people’s focus
has shifted to the here and now. Life
has become even more precious
because many believe that there is
nothing after death.
Riddell also said that people have
begun to place more trust in rea-
son and knowledge. Fear builds up
where there is a lack of facts.
In the old days religion offered
the answers, Wright said. Now, sci-
entists are seen as being able to
provide the answers to the big ques-
tions. However, they don’t always
have the answers, as in the case of
bird flu.
The lack of substantial facts sur-
rounding the possible bird flu pan-
demic has caused a problem in the
media, according to Riddell. There
is really no “objective truth” to
report. Most of the stories are based
on guesswork.
Thus, according to Durodié, the
government, the media and the pub-
lic have been lulled into “worst-
case speculation,” the majority of
debates centering on vaccines and
government preparedness.
No consensus was reached on how
risk should be communicated by
both the media and the government.
However, Riddell said that in her
experience, “The greater the fuss,
the smaller the risk – eventually.”
Dear Felix,
After reading your article
“Intestinal Worm Medicine” I
was rather disheartened by the
flippant attitude towards aller-
gies. Allergies are not just a case
of sneezing in the pollen season
or around animals, I suffer from
asthma, eczema and hay fever
and, as with me, often these
allergies are a way of life. For
instance, I must be careful which
soap powders I use as they can
cause my skin to itch uncontrolla-
bly, certain shower crèmes make
my skin unbearably tight (so
much so that I need to shower
again with different soap), some
soaps and moisturisers make the
skin on my hands so dry it can
crack and bleed. As I am sure
you can see this is more extreme
than the perceived ‘sniffles’ asso-
ciated with allergies! The article
only further served to highlight
how little most people truly know
about conditions such as asthma.
Most people’s idea of asthma
is little children wheezing after
running around too much in the
playground however as a severe
asthmatic I can assure you this is
not the case. There are reasons
as to why the NHS categorises
asthma in the chronic illness
bracket along with illnesses such
as diabetes. For example, not
only are asthmatics more prone
to illnesses such as flu but asth-
ma has its own inherent dangers;
one person dies every seven
hours of asthma in the UK and
the Asthma Campaign estimates
that 90% of these deaths are
preventable. What most people
don’t realise is that the major-
ity of asthmatics that die are in
fact often not chronic but young
students (often at university)
who only hold a blue inhaler and
take no preventative medicine.
This is because mild asthmatics
often underestimate the severity
of an attack and do not call an
ambulance in time (most deaths
occur within 2 hours of an attack
beginning!).
Personally, as a sufferer of
chronic asthma, I find my life
severely restricted and not just
from being unable to go deep
sea diving! My main ‘trigger’ is
cigarette smoke, hence I must
hold my breath every time I pass
a smoker in the street and cannot
enjoy entertainment at the union,
go to bars, clubs or restaurants
(something I’m not convinced
the Equal Opportunities Officer
will dare attempt to rectify). If I
should brave a smoky environ-
ment I run the risk of ending
the night with a trip to hospital
followed by a week off uni and at
the very least will be in severe
agony and unable to breathe. So
in answer to the question ‘What
would it take for you to deliber-
ately infect yourself with a dose
of intestinal worm eggs?’ I would
say that I would love to be part
of that trial if it meant that I
could, even for one week, spend
an evening in the union with my
friends or walk down the road
unafraid of it inadvertently lead-
ing to a hospital; small liberties
that so many students here take
for granted.

Kathryn Lougheed replies:
I am extremely sorry for any
offence my article on intestinal
worms and allergy may have
caused to serious allergy suf-
ferers. I can assure you that my
intention was never to ridicule
those who find their day to day
life affected by allergy. I com-
pletely understand how serious
allergic conditions including
asthma can be. The aim of the
article, however, was not to
educate the readers of the paper
about allergic disease, although
I do agree that most of us, me
included, know very little about
these conditions.
Instead I attempted to provide
a light-hearted look at how the
initially shocking suggestion of
infecting yourself with intesti-
nal worms could in fact have
some serious benefits to allergy
sufferers. While some of the
readers of this article, like you,
will undoubtedly find their lives
hampered by allergic disease,
most will consider hay fever and
other minor allergies little more
than an annoyance. Although
this opinion is obviously not
shared by you, the point of the
article was not to rectify the
common misconceptions about
allergy explained in your letter. I
had hoped that the article would
instead make readers think
about intestinal worms in a new
light, while at the same time let-
ting allergy sufferers know about
some research that may soon be
of benefit to them.
The more serious allergy suf-
ferers among the Felix readers
should take the fact that this
research is underway as an
indication that many scientists
take their conditions very seri-
ously indeed even if the majority
of the public do not fully under-
stand the severity of the prob-
lem. At the time of writing the
original article, the Nottingham
based group of scientists were
still trying to recruit hay fever
and asthma sufferers for their
trial. I can provide anyone inter-
ested in volunteering with their
phone number.
