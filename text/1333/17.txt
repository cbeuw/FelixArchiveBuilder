“First they came for people who
smack their kids and I did not
speak out because I did not smack
my kids (due to myself not having
any). Then they came for foxhunt-
ers and I did not speak out because
I was not a foxhunter. Then they
came for the smokers and I did
not speak out because I was not a
smoker. Then they came for me and
there was no one left to speak out
for me.”
The above is a rather crude
adaptation of a poem by Pastor
Martin Niemöller about the
complicity of German intellectuals
with the Nazi’s during their rise to
power. An early supporter of Hitler,
by 1934 he had come to oppose
the Nazis and by 1939 he was
imprisoned by the state. This week
saw the proposal of a partial ban on
smoking in public houses, excluding
private members clubs and pubs
which do not serve food. As a
non-smoker and with no intention
of working for a big tobacco
conglomerate some people may
find it surprising that I am opposed
to this measure. In common with
supporters of the ban, I too find
tobacco smoke utterly repulsive.
No-one likes breathing in second
hand smoke or coming home from
the pub and noticing that you smell
like an ashtray. Despite all these
unpleasantries there is one group
of people I have even greater
disdain for, the anti-smoking
fascists.
Most people don’t like smoke
but this legislation is using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut.
Smokers throughout the country
take great pleasure relaxing
over a pint accompanied by their
obligatory weed. Lets put this
problem into perspective. Smokers
are a mildly irritating group, not
a threat to national security. If
people dislike smoke-filled rooms
that much then they are free to
take themselves and their cash to
an establishment which chooses
to have a no-smoking policy. With
an exodus of customers, publicans
would be forced by the market
into changing their ways. Seems
sensible dosen’t it? Unfortunately
not to some. Led by Nanny-in-
Chief Patricia Hewitt, they have
summoned the courage to enforce
yet another health fatwa on the
poor, unlearned masses who are
clearly too stupid and downtrodden
to make their own decisions
regarding their well-being.
Such illiberal methods against
ordinary people seem to be
accepted by the country without
proper discussion. Those who
are against the new anti-terror
measures always seem to have
the benefit of a nice, well-spoken
man in a suit to make some obtuse
point about civil liberties every
time the government passes new
laws in an attempt to combat
Islamic extremism. There is at
least a debate over the anti-terror
laws with opponents claiming that
they persecute British Muslims.
When the same arguments are
made against the smoking and
hunting bans such concerns don’t
even merit a grown-up response
and in some cases only serves to
induce smug triumphalism from
Halt the tyranny of the do-gooders!

Faculties reshuffled
How can College just up and do this
without any consultation with the
students? We are told all the time
that ‘Imperial is first and foremost
about giving the students the best
possible education’.
Surely then College should take
the views of the students into
account when planning something
as drastic as a reorganisation of the
faculty system.
I’m glad to see Sameena
Misbahuddin, Union President, is
taking such an active stance on this
issue and look forward to what she
might report back from the Rector.
Kilian Frensch, President of ICU
Physical Sciences would like to
send a plea to Sir Richard - next
time let us know ahead of time. We
are not pawns in your uber-game
of chess.
Travelcards
TfL seem to have upped the
stakes in the ‘which Government
department can be the most
bureaucratic competition’. The
signature stamp which the registry
has been using is apparently
significantly different to that which
TfL have on record. Even though
registry have used the same stamp
for all students only some students
have experienced problems, how
does that work?
The issue does, now, seem to have
been resolved so hopefully all stu-
dent can now take advantage of the
reduced student fares.
Southside
All at Felix are severely
disappointed with the change
of plans for Southside bar. It
is upsetting to have to retract
our very positive comments in
‘Southside bar’ saved (Felix 1330).
In the leader of that issue we
stated “it is another indication
that College do in fact listen to the
students” well, it looks like they
don’t after all. One wonders when
Mustafa Arif’s influence at Imperial
will finally end.
ULU in chaos
It looks highly probable that
Imperial won’t remain part of UL
for that much longer. However,
we could remain part of ULU, but
given their current chaotic state, do
we really want to?

proponents of the ban. This is one
of those tricky situations where
we are left with a choice between
individual freedom and the banning
of activities that the majority of
right-thinking people find repellent.
Some people try and square this
circle by saying “yes I am in favour
of personal freedom, but if peoples
actions harm the health of innocent
bystanders then they must be
stopped.” Evidence to illustrate the
damage caused by passive smoking
is far from conclusive and most of
it has been over embellished by the
anti-smoking lobby. For example,
they are not so keen to preach to us
the results of research published by
Swedish toxicologist Robert Nilsson
who concluded that breathing
in passive smoke for a year is
equivalent to smoking between one
and two cigarettes annually, hardly
a lung-threatening amount. Instead
they hysterically shriek that our
nations smokers are selfishly
pushing us all in to an early grave,
in order to further their own holier-
than-thou agenda.
On a more personal level,
smokers aren’t really a bad bunch.
I’d rather go to the pub with my
smoker-friends and enjoy their
company despite their foul habit.
It detracts from a good night
out if several of your cohorts are
constantly having to leave the
building to feed their addiction.
Inhaling a few noxious fumes is
far more preferable than having
the group dynamics of my evening
continuously upset by this or worse
still, spend time in the company of
some goody two-shoes who’s life
been spent either in the gym or
munching on organic rice cakes.
I’d choose an evening with the
considerably more interesting,
albeit addicted and afflicted group
of smokers anytime. Why should
a bunch of out of touch, politically
correct Guardianistas who probably
wake up every morning to a yoga
session and go to bed with 3 feet of
water tubing jammed up their arse
affect how I socialise with a much
valued minority of my friends?
When faced with the choice
between serving food or allowing
smoking many establishments will
choose the latter which is what
advocates of the ban hope. Our own
union offers a far more sensible
policy by prohibiting smoking
in certain areas when food is
served. In my view this means that
everyone wins. People like myself
can enjoy their food in a smoke-
free environment and those who
fancy a puff are not inconvenienced
too much. This is admirable as
being a private members club,
under the new proposals we are
still free to do whatever the hell
we like with regards to allowing/
prohibiting smoking in union bars.
Lets make sure the on campus
health nazis don’t have another
opportunity to impose draconian
restrictions on our smoking friends.
If they succeed in this they’ll only
resurface later to try and prohibit
something else they don’t like about
those of us who muddle thorough
life without the assistance of a high
horse.
