accused of profiting from others’
misfortunes. However, the combined
profits of BP
, Shell and Exxon Mobil
reached $21bn – exceeding the GDP
of Sri Lanka – and the three compa-
nies’ combined revenue of $291.9bn
exceeded the GDP of Austria.
Other oil majors to release third-
quarter figures include Shell, who
as a result of hurricane Katrina is
currently producing less than half
of its normal oil production from the
Gulf of Mexico. The Anglo-Dutch
group’s profits increased 30% to
$5.8bn (£3.3bn).
Profits at BP increased 27 per
cent to $5.3bn (£3.9bn). The com-
pany has had a mixed year so far,
after the explosion at the Texas City
oil refinery that killed 15 employees
the company has signed deals open-
ing up key emerging markets in
both China and India, and remains
the only major oil company to have
significant operations in Russia.
Exxon Mobil corp. – the world’s larg-
est listed energy company – last
week unveiled record-breaking third
quarter net profit of $9.9bn (£6.6bn).
The figure, which represents a 75
per cent increase on the same peri-
od last year is the highest ever in
US corporate history. Despite clo-
sures at Gulf coast refining facilities
as a result of Hurricane Katrina,
the company faired better than its
peers, putting the cost of the hur-
ricane at $45m; equivalent to 50,000
bopd (barrels of oil per day).
Oil reached a record nomi-
nal high of $70.85 per barrel after
Hurricane Katrina crippled oil pro-
duction in the Gulf of Mexico. OPEC
released an extra 2 million barrels
of oil per day onto world markets in
September, but with refiners in need
of high quality, easy to refine crude,
the markets took little notice of the
extra supplies of low quality crude,
and prices have remained above
$60 per barrel since. The price of
gasoline rose 34 per cent in one
day, as the effect of the hurricane
became clear, yet some oil compa-
nies made losses on petrol as they
were unable to pass the price rise
on to consumers for fears of being

Oil majors incurred hurricane damage costs of hundreds of millions of
dollars, but still posted record profits on the back of high oil prices
record proﬁts
Katrina hit BP particularly hard,
reducing profits by $700m. BP has
hinted at possible job cuts in recent
days, in its refining, marketing and
lubricants divisions in an effort to
cut costs.
The biggest problem for the oil
majors is where to spend the cash.
The obvious option is to invest it
in new oil fields, but profit margins
need to be protected incase the oil
price falls dramtically. Option two
is investing in renewables, such as
wind and solar; but these lack the
returns provided by oil and gas.
Option three is acquisitions – using
the cash to purchase smaller rivals,
US President George W Bush last
week nominated Ben Bernanke
as his preferred candidate for the
role of chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, when the current chair-
man – Alan Greenspan – retires in
February.
The role of the “Fed” chairman
involves setting interest rates, which
determine the cost of borrowing on
both a domestic level (e.g. mortgag-
es) and at a corporate level. Interest
rates are a key tool, allowing cen-
tral bankers to control economic
growth and consumer inflation. Alan
Greenspan has held the post of Fed
chairman since 1987, and his is seen
as somewhat of a legend on Wall
Street for his ability to control the
markets.
On the US current account deficit,
which has reached $800bn or 6per
cent of GDP
, Mr Bernanke suggest-
ed that US economic policy had a
limited role and that the deficit was
the result of too little investment
and too much saving on a global
scale – and that it would correct
itself in due course. Others disagree
however, arguing than by raising
interest rates more aggressively;
consumer demand would fall and
rein in the deficit. Low cost goods
from China have kept prices of con-
sumer goods low in recent years,
but if Chinas growth was to slow,
this supply of cheap imports would
fall, pushing up inflation.
Bernanke is currently chairman
of the president’s council of eco-
nomic advisers, was previously a
ProffessorofEconomicsatPrinceton
University. Like Mr Greenspan, Mr
Bernanke favours focusing efforts
on controlling consumer price infla-
tion, rather than assets bubbles
– such as the dotcom boom, and
potentially the current US house
price bubble. In recent years the
Fed has become more transparent
– releasing minutes of its meetings
and revealing its perferred inflation
range of 1-2 per cent.
Where Mr Greenspan and Mr
Bernanke differ on policy, is whether
or not to commit to specific targets
for managing inflation, such as the
Eurozone and UK where inflation is
targeted a less than 2 per cent. By
offering specific targets Bernanke
would offer the markets a greater
degree of transparentcy and reduce
the volatility that is associated with
the uncertainty of interest rate
movements. The downside of giving
specific targets however, is that they
can leave little room to maneover if
other factors emerge
If US economic growth were to fall,
Mr Benankes biggest problem could
be the phenomenon of “stagflation”
where interest rate policy is torn
between low interest rates to stimu-
late a stagnant economy, and higher
interest rates to control inflation-
ary pressures. Whatever the global
economy holds for Mr Bernanke in
the next few years, Mr Greenspan
has set a tough precedent that will
be hard to follow.
The price of gold has rallied this
year, over concerns that record oil
prices will fuel inflation. Gold is used
by investors as a store of wealth to
beat inflation. The yellow metal is
tipped to reach $500 per troy oz in
2006 and reached an 18 year high
of $480.25 per troy oz earlier this
month. The bond market however
has shown no signs of worries over
inflation, as core and consumer
inflation approach 2.5 and 3 per cent
respectively.
At the time of going to press the
markets are aniticpating the fed to
raise interest rates for the 12 suc-
cessive time, bringing them to 4
per cent
but the target companies will be
very expensive in the high oil price
environment.
The fourth and most probable
option is for companies to “buy-
back” their own shares, and increas-
ing the value of remaining shares,
because profits are divided between
fewer shares.
The Treasury may have another
ideas however, as it considers rais-
ing royalties on North Sea oil reve-
nues from the current 40%, in order
to bolster public finances

Welcome to the latest addition
to Felix – the Business section.
By way of an introduction my
name is Simon Jones, I have
worked for Shell Exploration
and for BP
, and I am currently
in my second year of Geology
in the RSM, and my interests,
or rather my expertise are in
the oil and mining sectors.
Legend has it that “half of
Imperial end up working down
the road in the city”, and although
this may not be entirely true, the
business section is the perfect
place for all you millionaires-
to-be to kick-off your career in
finance.
Many people simply don’t have
time to read the Financial Times
on a regular basis, or are baffled
by all the jargon and phrases such
as “credit derivative swaps”. My
intention is not to compete with
the FT, but is to pick the most sig-
nificant stories that have devel-
oped throughout the week, and
present them in a form that is
concise, and the average reader
is able to understand.
