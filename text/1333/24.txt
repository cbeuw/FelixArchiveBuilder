Ho-Yee put in another gritty show-
ing for the RSM but unfortunately
couldn’t shake her marker. With our
goalkeeper Kiran out for the next
few months for surgery (we all wish
him well and a speedy return) vice
captain Rachel Kershaw stepped
into the keepers kickers at the last
minute and was faced with a difficult
challenge from the Strollers’ attack,
and had to deal with an extremely
well executed p-flick. Not to mention
getting injured by her own captain
in warm up, so thanks very much
Rach. Tom should also be thanked
for choosing to play for the RSM
rather than one of the many other
teams hankering after his skills. The
second half was where the dam-
age was done and the fitness lev-
els were laid bare, three goals in
relatively quick succession saw the
game change very quickly. Chances
a plenty were had to even and turn
the score line around but a lack of
match sharpness (and maybe cer-
tain hangovers) meant we couldn’t
capitalise on them.
The post match festivities were
every bit as enjoyable as the match
and involved many a downed pint
(with extras of course) and much
alcohol was imbibed. Tip for our
man of the match: your bed will be
much more comfortable than the
floor of the disabled toilets at the
union the next time you want a nap
after the game.

A big thank you goes out to the
London Strollers, our victorious
opponents who showed that sports-
manship is far from dead. They’re a
great bunch of people and a really
good club to play, so any other hock-
ey people looking for mixed games
should certainly look them up on the
web. Thank you London Strollers.
Firstly, the score was a little harsh
I thought. Man of the Match was
Tim. Special mentions go to Tom
and Rachel.
It’s never nice to lose 5-2 but eve-
ryone enjoyed playing and it was
great to see so many people turn
up, its was a great social event. The
game started well with the teams
trading goals and keeping level with
each other. Some fast runs from the
Strollers’ right forward kept Man
of the Match Tim very busy. In fact
if you looked at the game you’d be
hard pushed to put him in one posi-
tion, as he was basically playing
the entire left hand side. Charles
Purshouse made a brilliant debut
for the RSM in a holding centre
mid role giving Mike and Tom the
freedom to cause problems for the
strollers’ defence (how many goals
was it you missed Tom?). This being
a mixed event the ladies deserve a
mention, Sarah and Susie putting
in their usual high class perform-
ances gave the whole team a boost.

Further to last weeks column for all
those interested in the development
of the facilities at Harlington I have
some progress to report. Sport and
Leisure as you all know have worked
tremendously hard over the past few
years to improve sports facilities for
staff and students. You only have to
look as far our new sports centre
to see this. The money secured by
them for the new centre and the
refurbishment of off-campus gyms
means that Imperial is one of the
leading British Universities when it
comes to investment in sport. Not
bad for an inner city campus!
Having spoken to the staff at
Sport and Leisure it turns out that
a major stumbling block when it
comes to erecting new floodlights
is not just obtaining College fund-
ing but gaining planning permis-
sion from Hillingdon Council. The
ground at first sight appears that
it is in the middle of nowhere, it’s
only claim to fame being that it is
smack bang in the middle of a flight
path out of Heathrow. It turns out
that there are a few houses from
nearby Harlington village close to
the east boundary. Obviously the
concerns of residents must be taken
in to account but a commonly held
view is that surely a few additional
pylons aren’t that much of an eye-
sore? Floodlights occasionally used
before bedtime shouldn’t even reg-
ister when you have planes flying
overhead every few minutes seven
days a week? Perhaps our pragma-
tism is someone else’s tyranny so
this would need to be examined in
greater depth.
Not surprisingly support amongst
students is unanimous. An unholy
alliance of rugby, football and hock-
ey clubs has formed over this issue.
IC Hockey Captain Richard Bacon
sums our position up very well, “If
Imperial is going to try to establish
itself much more prominently in the
sports department, it’s going to have
to invest some money in facilities
like better flood lights for every-
one to encourage sports.” Sport and
Leisure again indicate that funding
may be available for such a project.
The College take great pride in the
success of our sports teams and
their investment in our indoor facili-
ties shows their commitment to our
athletes. Harlington is an excellent
facility and it is important that we
work with College to ensure that it
reaches its full potential. This will
not just be for our own benefit, but
also for subsequent generations of
IC sportspeople.
Now to close on a different matter.
We are now a month into term and
I would like to thank all of you who
have contributed to Sports Felix.
As ever we are always looking for
new writers, especially amongst the
niche sports who are neglected by
mainstream coverage. Even just a
piece telling readers more about
your sport we want to know. I feel
urged to make this plea as I rec-
ognise that football match reports
seem to be dominating this term.
Perhaps I’m a little too good at
haranguing my fellow footballers in
to churning out match reports. I’ve
got no desire to turn our sports
section into a fanzine for my own
club and really would appreciate
contributors from a far wider variety
of sports.
