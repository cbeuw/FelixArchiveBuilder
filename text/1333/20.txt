Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
What is that I spy in
the heavens? Is it
Venus? Or cupid! The
arrow has struck your
heart, but will love’s
poison infect your
head as well?
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
A web of mystery has
spun itself around
your life! Beware
of being the fly that
has been caught.
Something that looks
innocent may in fact be the spider
that’s been hunting you.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Look who’s on top of
the world this week,
and why not! Fate’s
got its eye on you
and has luck and love
heading your way.
Keep your wits about you though.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
There’s a bright light
shining down on you.
No its not the mystic
heavens sending you
their blessings….
its London’s neon
nightlife! Get out there and shake
that arse!!
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Sugar and spice and
all things nice. We all
know what happens
when we give into out
sweet tooth. I’d sched-
ule an appointment
for the dentist.
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
What goes around
comes around and
this has been brewing
for a while. Try not to
be put off by the bad
luck you have this
week, instead concentrate on long
term priorities.
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
Well, well, well…look
whose been caught
with their hand in the
cookie jar. Well there’s
no shame when they
are yours to eat! Dig
in!
Gemini (May 22nd – Jun 21st)
Slugs and snails and
puppy dogs tails.
Become one with
nature this week, but
don’t be too surprised
if canines seem wary
of you.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
Who says there’s
no such thing as
a free lunch? This
rare delight is yours
for the scoffing this
week. The food may
be fit for a king, but the company is
like yesterday’s leftovers. Can you
stomach it?
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
You are about to em-
bark on an interest-
ing chapter in your
life which you will
embrace perhaps a
little too cautiously.
It’s time to relax a little, after all life
shouldn’t be taken so seriously…
you’ll never escape it alive anyway!
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
It’s about time you
started acting like
YOU! The turning
point is coming.... it’s
time you go where
there is no path and
leave a trail for others to follow.
You’ll have loads of people following
in your footsteps.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
You’re stuck in a rut,
but I spy a gorgeous
Leo who will elevate
you out of your misery
this week. You will
begin to relish in
your new ‘Do I look like I care?!’
attitude… I’m so jealous.
Attack of the Killer Telephone
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I am a medic who’s currently on
a psychiatry firm, and I’m really
worried ‘cause I’m every bit as
crazy as the patients on the wards!
I don’t think I’ll ever be a doctor if
I get admitted for being nuts. What
can I do?
Yours,
Angst
Dear Angst,
Well you can start by breaking into
the hospital pharmacy and taking
a couple of sedatives: diazepam
should do it, to calm yourself down.
Feeling better? Good; then listen:
you ‘think’ you’re every bit as crazy
as the patients - or did someone
tell you? Now, I have a couple of
medic mates and they may not be
the most normal of people, but they
aren’t insane and they managed
to fail the mini mental psychiatry
tests. They all also tend to be total
hypochondriacs (constantly self
diagnosing). It seems that you also
suffer from the same problem. I
mean, come on - unless you don’t
tend to binge drink and you’ve
recently found yourself waking up in
strange places with no recollection
of the night before and covered in
mud, or have developed a habit
of standing above your sleeping
flatmates with a knife waiting
for them to wake up (or similar
Norman Bates-like things), I really
don’t think you have a problem.
Here’s what Miss C. orders: finish
your rotation; remember to take a
breather; and try avoid spending
more time than necessary in the
psychiatry ward and I think you’ll
be just fine.
Fatty Fat Fat
Dear Miss C.,
I’ve managed to put on 4Kg in the
past 3 weeks. Not too sure whether
it’s the daily curries, general
takeaway meals or the boozy
nights. Thing is, I didn’t really
mind - but now the other guys in
hockey have started to mock me!
What do you suggest?
Hugh Mongous
Dear Hugh Mongous,
Well, your question isn’t really
the hardest thing in the world to
answer! I’m pretty sure that all of
the above are the cause of your
increased weight. Although to be
fair, if all you’ve been living off is
takeaway meals and alcohol, then
I’m impressed its only 4kg! My
advice: try and eat more healthily
and lay off the lard. Did you not
watch super-size me? Cut down a
bit on the booze as well, and that’ll
probably help. However if neither
of these are really the solution
that you’re looking for then I’d
just exercise a bit more. A couple
more workout sessions etc. and the
weight will be flying off and you’ll
be back to your normal size. As for
your mates? Just challenge them
to a drinking contest, it sounds
like you’ve definitely had enough
practice to drink them under the
table. If you choose the exercise
option, then you’ll soon be running
laps round them and then they’ll be
the ones with red faced.
I’ve Got the Munchies
Dear Miss C,
The past two Fridays I’ve eaten
lunch with a girl I’ve recently
met. I’m pretty sure that she has
a boyfriend, but she never talks
about him around me. If I’m
interested in dating her should I
bring the subject of her boyfriend
up? Is she not talking about him
because she doesn’t want to scare
off a potential friend or because
she is interested in me? I’d just
like to know what’s on her mind.
Is it ok to ask or will that make her
uncomfortable?
Feeling Hungry
Dear Feeling Hungry,
You want to know what’s on her
mind? Well the only way to do that is
to ask her, I’m afraid. I’m an advice
columnist sweetie, not a mind
reader. Now normally it’s the girls
that over-think the situation, but
in this case you’ve managed to top
that chart. You’re eating lunch with
a friend, not planning a marriage.
Have you thought that maybe
as you don’t know her boyfriend
there’s no real reason for her to talk
to you about it? The best thing is
to stay friends and get to know her
better, I’m sorry but two lunches
don’t count for anything! If she likes
you it will be more obvious! Girls
really aren’t that complicated. If you
want to test the water, ask her out
to another gathering with a group
of mates, and just get to know her
better on a personal level. Flirt with
her, see if you get a reaction and
work from there! Just take it one
step at a time.
One Orgasm Too Far
Dear Miss C.,
I had such a strong orgasm when
having sex with my boyfriend that
I pooed myself. Frankly, it was
disgusting. My boyfriend didn’t say
a word, but he must be disgusted,
musn’t he?What should I do?
Ashamed
Dear Ashamed,
Don’t worry, we all have moments
when we let the moment take over.
If he really loves you he should
realise that you were just giving
your all to the moment. However, if
this happens again I would advice
refraining from anal sex. It could be
due to a medical condition, semi-
latus rectum, but I suggest you go
see your doctor ASAP
.
