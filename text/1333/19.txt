Praying for a space
Dear Felix,
Friday 21 October saw the Islamic
society once again forced to hold
“Jumah” or Friday Prayers on
Queen’s Lawn due to the fact
that all the places, such as the
Great Hall, that could hold the
approximately 300 students and
staff of the Islamic society were
booked. This situation has arisen
as previously explained in Felix
(issue 1331) due to the closure of
Southside, where prayers had been
held for the past 20 years in the
Union controlled gym.
Many have asked about using
nearby mosques. Unfortunately
the closest mosques that conduct
Friday congregational prayers
are thirty minutes away from
college. It would be impossible for
students or staff to attend without
missing valuable lecture time or
work. Along with this, the closest
mosques are already at full capacity
and cannot absorb the 300 students
and staff.
What also must be remembered
is that the Friday congregational
prayers are an obligation on all
Muslims. It is performed by all
Muslims whether they consider
themselves devout or rarely identify
themselves as Muslims. It is the
‘lowest common denominator’ of all
prayers.
As the situation stands now the
Islamic society are allowed to book
rooms (such as the Great Hall)
as any other club or society. This
means that the venue may have
to change from week to week.
Anyone who is part of or helps to
run any society would know that
it is hard enough to tell members
of a change of venue without the
added difficulty of having around
300 people to inform. Also as the
past two weeks have shown there
may not be any available space to
conduct communal prayers.
The request is a simple one
to college: a permanent room of
sufficient size to hold the Friday
congregational prayers during the
lunch time. This is not a request
for a new service but rather
a continuation of a previously
established one.
There may be complaints about
the prayers being held on Queen’s
Lawn but the Islamic society are
just trying to find a place to pray.

Star Letter
Offensive Cartoon
Dear Editor,
I found the cartoon printed next to
editorial in the last issue of Felix
(issue 1332) rather offensive.
If there’s anything worse than a
racist taunt to an ordinary Muslim,
it’s being associated with terrorism
and extremism.
What you may not realise is that
religious Muslims, particularly
those living in Arab states,
have long been subject to state-
orchestrated terror: in Iraq under
Saddam, in Syria under Hafez Al-
Assad and in Egypt under Nasser,
to mention but a few.
I’m not particularly against Felix
turning into a tabloid, but let’s not
adopt The Sun’s poor journalistic
standards. The beard is often worn
by religious Muslims: it is not a sign
of extremism. And just to note,
the 9/11 hijacker Atta was clean-
shaven.
Yours Faithfully,
Habib Abdur-Rahman
SAS, Felix’s editoral cartoonist,
responds:
It has been brought to my attention
that some students have found the
cartoon I drew in last week’s issue of
Felix offensive. Firstly, I would like
to apologise since that was not my
intention. Being a Muslim student
myself, I drew it with the intention
of ridiculing the idea that Muslim
students at Imperial could ever be
considered as having extremist
beliefs. In reterospect, I could have
expressed my ideas more clearly
so as to avoid such misunderstad-
ings. I would like to apologise again,
and will endeavour to make sure
any future cartoons are clearly
structured so as to avoid causing
offence.
That said, all ethinic groups are
stereotyped whether it be Muslims
with beards or the French with
striped shirts and rings of garlic.
Cartoons are exaggerated and they
play on the stereotype because
that is what people associate the
relevant ethnic group with. While
I understand that many Muslims
wish to change the image of Islam
in wake of recent events, I somehow
doubt a cartoon wearing a sign say-
ing ‘non-stereotyped Muslim’ would
be appreciated either.
Yours Faithfully,
SAS

Lawn. They claim that they are
forced to cause inconvenience for
fellow students and staff because
ICL would not provide them with
a room for their obligations as
Muslims. I completely agree with
ICL
’s position that the College
is secular and should therefore
not provide space for communal
worship. Religion has nothing to do
with ICL, irrespective of whether
Muslim, Christian or Hindu.
The flyer claimed that the closest
mosque would be too far away to be
convenient and instead gather on
Queen’s Lawn. Well if it is so impor-
tant to them, Hyde Park is just
minutes walk away with plenty of
public space to hold a congregation.
I assume the Queen’s Lawn gather-
ing is designed to elbow College into
providing a room (free of charge?)
thereby breaking the secular tradi-
tion of the College. As an atheist, I
am happy not to be bombarded with
religious beliefs during my lunch
break around Queen’s Lawn.

Dear Editor,
Imperial College should give full
support to the Muslims that want
to pray on Queen’s lawn. This is
because any decision forced by mob
action can’t fail to be better than a
reasoned, rational one.
To house the Muslim prayer
crowds, a dedicated prayer
platform pointing directly at Mecca
should be commissioned.
The people praying on Queen’s
Lawn are doing their best when
they align their bowing towards the
Sir Alexander Fleming building.
Their best is not good enough.
The Earth is not flat. A sloping
platform to angle their prayers
straight towards the Ka’bah should
be constructed. According to my
calculations, it should point down
from the horizontal in London at an
angle of 21 degrees 28 minutes to
compensate for the sphericality of
the Earth.
Without such a slope, their prayer
rays just leave the globe at a
tangent and uselessly drift off into
space. Plans should be drawn up
straight away.

Dear Felix,
Just taking this opportunity to say
that Felix is much better this year.
Grabbing headlines, fab photos, col-

issues at your finger tips. Very well
done to all involved, you have cre-
ated a very dynamic read.
State of the medical
school
Dear Felix,
I feel that Imperial’s position as the
best medical school in Britain (fol-
lowed by the delightful Hull) is not
so much a testament to the scien-
tific calibre of its students but their
linguistic calibre.
I’m sitting here procrastinating
in the medic computer room (with
half my year) as the lecture I’m
supposed to be in goes on next door.
This has nothing to do with not
wanting to learn, it’s simply because
the level of English required to lec-
ture at Imperial is equivalent to the
standard expected in a McDonald’s
entrance exam. I strongly feel that
the study of medicine should not be
made even more complicated by the
additional requirement of decipher-
ing the incomprehensible piffle that
dribbles out of their mouth.
In many schools there is outrage
when the ratio of teachers to stu-
dents exceeds 1:30. In our medical
school the ratio of lecturers to stu-
dents is 1:360 - too many, in fact, to
be held in our lecture theatre. This
makes learning harder than it need
be, so to have lecturers who speak
very poor English is a further prob-
lem that really should be avoided.
Concerned 2nd year student,
Faculty of medicine.
