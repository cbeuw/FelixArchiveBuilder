Cheating medic
scum humiliated!
Massacres have been a regrettably
regular occurrence throughout the
history of mankind, but few have
been quite so ruthless and cold-
blooded as the Sevenths brutal dem-
olition of our home grown medic
scum. If it had not been for the
obligatory medic cheating, the score
could easily have reached double,
perhaps even treble figures.
In now traditional Sevenths fash-
ion, we shot out of the blocks and
for the third game in a row found
ourselves in the fortunate position
of being 3-0 up within 20 minutes.
The first came within seconds of
the kick off as Ian’s corner was
tapped in at the back post by a mys-
tifyingly unmarked Jarlath. The
second goal provided an answer to
the eternal question: what happens
when comedy defending meets com-
edy attacking? Answer: A comedy
goal of course! Jack was played in
from the right wing. A goal seemed
a certainty until he produced a com-
plete air-shot (a dummy? Whatever
you say Jack…) the medics failed
to clear, however, and tiny, tiny Pas
was on hand to belt the ball over
the flailing keeper and into the goal.
Inspirational leader Sam was on
hand to score his third in as many
games with a powerful drive from
the edge of the box after more good
work by Ian to make it 3-0 to the 7’s.
At about this stage the clearly
jealous medics realised that they
had no chance of winning the game
and started trying to break the sev-
enths players’ wonderfully skilful
legs (perhaps they wanted to per-
form some kind of leg transplant
operation so that they could have
a good football team aswell? Who
knows…). These dirty tactics only
proceeded to inspire the sevenths to
new levels of absolute amazingness
and the score reached 5-0 before
half time. First Pas won the ball in
midfield and fed Jarlath, who having
spotted that the goalie was sporting
a pair of the very latest crisp-packet
hands (all the rage in this year’s
ULU football leagues) proceeded to
drill the ball straight through them.
Jack assures me that he scored the
5th goal, which was bundled over
the line after a goal mouth scram-
ble. I, however, have decided that it
was an own goal. Unlucky son.
The medics combination of being
well rubbish and cheating made
the half time team talk easy (just
like the game, ha!) and the flow
of goals continued after the break.
Pas got his second after collecting a
rebound from his own shot and then
completed his hat-trick with a beau-
tiful left-footed finish from a wonder-
ful through ball from Alan to make
the score IC Sevenths 7 – Cheating
medics 0. Easy! Easy! Easy! That
is what the thousands of fans not
present at Harlington would have
been chanting if they both existed
and had turned up.
Jack made the score 8-0 with a
header from Paul’s free kick but
the cheating medics disallowed it
for a “marginal offside”…Well…
whatever, it was still 7-0. Somehow
convinced that they hadn’t already
cheated enough, the medics then
turned down the most blatant pen-
alty ever after Ian beat 3 men and
nutmegged a fourth before being
kicked over in the box. I guess the
medics thought 0-7 was a pretty
respectable score, but 0-8 could not
be allowed at any cost.
The focus now fell on the defence,
who have been outstanding all sea-
son so far. Paul, Mo, Adie, Wongy
and Alan wanted a clean sheet
SO badly…but they didn’t get one
because they let the medics score
after Ario got lobbed again. Was
this the most miraculous comeback
ever? Could the medics do it? 7
goals in 10 minutes? Don’t be stu-
pid. The game finished 7-1. IC were
delighted with the win, the medics
were delighted with the amount of
cheating that they did. Everyone’s
a winner.

After being disappointed on not get-
ting to play the first scheduled match
of the season due to a much delayed
forfeit by Goldsmiths College,
the Thirds went on to play their
first ULU match last Wednesday.
Making an extra effort to meet early,
ensuring we reached Potters Bar on
time…due to our somewhat sh*te
orienteering skills.
“Snatching a quick
lead within the first
few centres, the
match got off to a
great start”
On arriving at Potters Bar station
the Royal Vet’s were there wait-
ing, and after a long drive through
the country roads in a car that felt
like it was about to break-down any
minute we made it to the courts
in good time. Snatching a quick
lead within the first few centres, the
match got off to a great start…all
the girls were in the zone and had
the determination to prove to Jade
we could win (a smart motivational
tactic from the captain after a decla-
ration that she thought we’d lose).
After the first half we were still
holding onto a fab 8-6 lead, and still
had the energy to keep the game in
our hands. With the Vets looking
tired and getting sloppy Imperial
shot in there keeping possession of
the ball and playing out the game at
our own pace. Despite a few disput-
able calls from the Ref, Imperial
still managed to keep the lead while
commendably keeping the team
spirit high!
Finishing the match with a win
of 19-16, we endeavoured another
dodgy car journey back to the sta-
tion and on reaching home….made
a well deserved visit to the union
for a celebratory drink! Special con-
gratulations to Tombo for winning
player of the match and praisewor-
thy play from the rest of the girls!
Encouraging
start!

Can a team that plays in all pur-
ple be taken seriously? IC 2nds
were about to find out, taking on
the second team from a university
that boasts 34,000 students. IC 2nds
entered the game with their three
previous matches featuring a mind-
boggling total of 22 goals, lending the
suggestion that goals were to be the
order of the day. However, with over
half of these goals in the ‘Against’
column the defence was beginning
to get a reputation of being more
like a colander than a sieve, perhaps
even a net.
Barely five minutes had passed
and it was already nil-nil, although
IC 2nds were looking better value
for their nil. Left-winger Chris
Parrott was dribbling a lot and the
opposition didn’t like it – you could
see it on their faces.
AK made a darting run and
aided by a somewhat clumsy tack-
le, collapsed in the D like a pack
of cards with acute angina. Up
stepped Parrott who matter-of-
factly curled the ball into the bot-
tom-left corner of the goal. It was
well executed, on the contrary to the
London Met’s shoot-to-score policy.
Commendably, they were hitting the
target but unfortunately for them,
they had come across the wrong
man. James Haugh in the IC nets
was impregnable.
The fan didn’t have much long-
er to wait until the second goal,
which uncannily saw centre back
Milad Toolabi running with the ball
near the opposition corner flag and
whipping in a superb cross. It was
stylishly converted by Gready who
wheeled away in obvious delight.
The start of the final 45 saw IC
camped in their own half defend-
ing an almost endless succession
of boring throw-ins, but the back
four stayed awake, held firm and
conceded nothing. The London Met
captain may have pulled off one of
his players at half time but even
this could not serve to inspire his
defenders to rise to the occasion
and be more solid in the second
half. London Met needed a cutting
edge as badly as Bill Oddie, whereas
IC looked threatening with lots of
possession in Met’s half. This was
rewarded when IC were awarded a
penalty for a handball, and it was
Gready who coolly slotted the ball
into the bottom-left. Gready was
the obvious choice for the pen once
AK had ruled himself out of the run-
ning having just been nobbled by his
opposite number, who may or may
not have been deaf. By this stage
Gready’s ankle injury was starting
to cause problems and AK still had
a fresh pair of legs up his sleeve
in the way of Perry, so the obvious
straight-swap was made. The third
goal caused Met to collapse like
Paul Robinson’s stock in Ramsay
Street when it was revealed that he
was a master embezzler and was
knobbing everybody’s missuses.
Their heads had dropped and their
knuckles had really begun to drag.
It wasn’t long before D.A.L. slotted
home the fourth and Perry com-
pleted the rout with a well finished
run on goal.
So to answer the question: London
Met 2nds can be treated as seriously
as well…Harchester United.

Easy victory for IC second XI The Imperial College Sailing Club
attended a competition at the Welsh
Harp reservoir at Wembley last
weekend. It was not a sort of com-
petition that the Club are used to
as it was an ‘open’, meaning that in
addition to the usual student con-
tingent, anyone and everyone could
compete for the first prize. We had
not attended this competition for the
last two years but the last time we
entered we managed 3 entries in the
top ten. This year’s team included 2
new members and only one mem-
ber of last year’s team, but despite
the lack of experience of the Welsh
Harp’s quirky conditions, we were
confident it wouldn’t show.
“the team have to
be congratulated for
their efforts”
The competition comprised of four
races, two either side of lunch. The
wind conditions were light mean-
ing that mistakes that were made
were punished more severely than
usual. The slow speed of the racing,
allowed the least experienced of the
team time to take in the intricacies
of competitive racing and as the day
went on, the performances lifted.
The wind also lifted as the day went
on and this change of conditions
allowed the team a bit of variety in
their sailing. The day finished with
the Imperial College teams in 9th,
10th, and 12th. While not as impres-
sive as our last visit, the team have
to be congratulated for their efforts
when you consider the lack of train-
ing we have had since the start of
term.
As a club we will next be compet-
ing at Loughborough on the 3rd/4th
December. The sailing is not the
only fun part, as the competition
has a reputation for its impressive
post-sailing social events. If you are
interested in sailing, from competi-
tive racing to learning to sail, you
