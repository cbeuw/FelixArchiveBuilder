Imperial College have announced
plans to merge the faculties of Life
Sciences and Physical Sciences,
to create a new Faculty of Natural
Sciences. The Rector announced
the decision, which takes immedi-
ate effect, in an email to selected
College staff on Tuesday 1 October.
No students were consulted or even
informed of the decision.

Imperial students are being charged
£5 a time to take a chance at getting
a student discount travelcard, with
no guarantee of success – because
Transport for London (TfL) can’t
recognise a Registry stamp.
TfL currently runs a scheme
whereby students in London can
receive travel discounts through a
successful application for a student
Oyster card. Applications are made
with forms only available through
Imperial College Registry, which are
stamped with the official Imperial
College seal, and the Registrar’s
signature.
One Imperial student, having had
his application rejected, enquired
about the reason and was told that
signature on record didn’t quite
match up with that provided by the
Registry. He was told that nothing
could be done until the Registry
had sorted out the problem with
TfL, replacing the signature used
for comparison – meaning he would
have to make another application,
costing another five pounds, and
would have no travel discounts in
the mean time. Again, no guarantee
could be made that his second appli-
cation would be successful. Further
investigation revealed that other
students were in similar predica-
ments.
What about a refund for students?
The official line is that the money
covers the processing of the form,
and is entirely non-refundable – even
for failed applications, regardless of
reason.
Unofficially, Registry staff have
mentioned that it appears that
approximately half of the appli-
cations made recently have been
refused on the same grounds, which
implies that half have been accept-
ed. Yet all the applications made
through College have been stamped
with exactly the same seal and sig-
nature.
Both the Union and Registry have
taken the matter in hand, and are
contacting TfL to try and resolve
the situation and provide feedback

“Its appalling that students and the student’s Union were not consulted in
advance” Sameena Misbahuddin, Union President
Can Life scientists and Physicists live in harmony? We’re about to find out
Adam Rae
their Faculty roles on 31 December.
Prof Duff will move on to take the
Abdus Salaam Chair of Theoretical
Physics, Professor Borysiewicz will
remain Deputy Rector, a position in
which he is well established.
In the announcement, the Rector,
Sir Richard Sykes, pointed out that
it is becoming “increasingly appar-
ent that discipline areas within
the two Faculties [have become]
more closely aligned” since the last
Faculty structure assessment in
2001”. He draws attention to the
vital statistics: “The new combined
Faculty will employ over 1,100 staff,
teach over 2,700 undergraduates,
train over 680 PhD students, and
have a research income totalling
£56.5 million”. He also described the
merger as “compelling and excit-
ing”.
However, students don’t seem
to be sharing Sir Richard’s excite-
ment. Sameena Misbahuuddinn,
Imperial College Union President,
expressed the general upset stu-
dents are feeling due to the lack of
consultation: “After everything that
happened last year with students
not being informed about the future
of the Wye Campus, this is another
example of College not informing us
of what is happening and the effects
that it could have on students.”
One second year Biochemistry
student said, “Now there’ll be a load
more really ugly gimps in our fac-
ulty!” Some students dislike the per-
ceived loss of individuality among
departments, which is important for
a community feeling within cours-
es; other objections were raised in
response to the similarity to univer-
sities such as Cambridge, which they
consider to have a weaker course
structure than Imperial College.
They fear that the change in Faculty
structure may lead to blurring of
discipline boundaries rather than
broadening of scope predicted by
College. Students are also doubtful
that the handover will be as smooth
as the Rector predicts.
WhenapproachedbyFelix, College
said that the decision was “made
exclusively by the Management
Board”, the College’s “senior deci-
sion-making body”. A body on which
only a select members of College
staff sit, so there is the possibil-
ity that the majority of College staff
were also kept in the dark until
recently.
At the time of going to print Felix
was unable to secure comment from
the principal members of staff in the
faculties concerned.
