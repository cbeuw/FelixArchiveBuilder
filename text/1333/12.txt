ALBUM REVIEWS
Fifteen years and countless raves
later, Britain’s best-known munters
return to the nation’s conscience
with Their Law, a singles collec-
tion to showcase their best-loved
moments.
Liam and the boys don’t waste any
time in kicking things off. They’re
unafraid to make their presence
felt, using the full throttle sonic
assault more commonly known as
Firestarter to do so. This track is
mind-blowing from the first to the fif-
teenth listen. It’s contemporary; the
pugilistic Breathe is equally infec-
tious and danceable, as is Smack
My Bitch Up with its rhythmic turns
and menacing vocals driving the
track with aplomb. So far so good
– where’s my variety meal?
Cue The Law and Out Of Space,
two disparate and diverse tracks
showcasing the spirit of the Prodigy.
Experimentalism. Where else can
you find an Arabic-inspired tribal
beat in the midst of robotic noi-
secore and guitar licks on the same
track? Out Of Space is especially
likeable, with its laidback reggae
tune and ska-shuffle beats. One for
the dippier moments with the Xbox,
I tell you.
Other tracks of note include
Poison, which sees the band on a
ragga tip, grizzly vocals and orches-
tral backing intact, before Aphex
Twin gets paraphrasing in its vor-
tex sound. Girls is equally potent,
with 80’s inspired electropop replete
with synths and vocoders knocking
Studio B over and out.
So far so good – what about the
obligatory trip back in time? Liam
can’t neglect us the way his hairy
Mancunian brother-in law can – he’s
got talent for chrissakes! (His taste,
on the other hand, upon picking the
trashier Appleton sister is more
questionable.)
Well. It’s here, in fully glow-sticked
glory. Tripping on acid and ecstasy
is the only way one can convince
themselves that the likes of Charly,
Jericho and No Good are decent
tracks in any way, shape or form.
They’re techno-dirge in its worst,
ear-splitting form. Spitfire and One
Love are equally turgid. Voodoo
People fares slightly better, since
it’s got a grimy yet seductive side
to it, much in the way the orientally-
inspired Hot Rice ends up closing
the show.
That’s the way I’d like to see it.
Closed, over and out - a memora-
ble listen that’s not quite my cup
of tea; I’d stick to Fat Of The Land
and Always Outnumbered, Never
Outgunned if experimentalism and
techno-wizardry floats your boat.
Age before beauty can be a wonder-
ful thing; I’m so glad XL Records
are aware that experience breeds
masterpieces.

Oh yes, oh yes. It’s finally here!
The quintet from Glasgow that is
El Presidente are releasing their
self-titled debut album. I must say
that I have been anticipating this
for some time now, and as those
of you who have been associated
with the AMS in any shape or form
will know, is where the president’s
t-shirt comes from, so we’d expect
him to be a fan also... maybe (I’m
not so sure – ed.). Since becoming
aware of their (increasing) presence
at the start of this year, my interest
has grown and became cemented
when I had the surprise pleasure of
seeing them play live; I can testify
that they sounded unstoppable.
If there is one thing about the
songs on this album, that is their
catchiness and familiarity. Each one
was easily recognised after only one
hearing five months prior. I guar-
antee that the majority of readers
will know at least one of their songs
without being aware of it. How to
describe their sound? It’s difficult.
As you go through the album, you’ll
encounter pop, rock, funk and disco
in all kinds of glorious combina-
tions.
It opens thunderously with not
less than four of El Pres’s sin-
gles, the first of which is Without
You, a song very reminiscent of
Catatonia’s better known stuff, but
with cheesier vocals and stronger
bassline. This is a general feature
of the album; the bassline pounds
relentlessly throughout, and is any-
thing but monotone, while the vocals
are doubled up on most of the songs
and sing some of the cheesiest stuff
you will hear this year. It is all so
well put together though, that you
won’t be ashamed to listen or even
sing along to them; despite the most
unlikely combinations of elements,
everything works!
The real treats on the album only
include one of the opening singles:
Rocket, as well as being hilariously
titled (I have always found some-
thing funny about guys and their love
of rockets ever since that Simpsons
episode where Homer ‘rides’ one at
the US Air Force base) has a tune
that I can’t quite guarantee I’ve put
my finger on, but you know goddam-
nit, it reminds me of the soundtrack
to earlier Tekken games. The vocals
are again doubled up, and the cho-
rus is wonderfully simple “aaaa-
aaa-aaa-aa-aa-aaaa-aaa-aa-aa I’m
gonna block it, fly like a rocket”.
Marvellous!
Old Times also has an addictive
chorus with plenty of la-la-las, and is
slightly cleaner than the other songs
(except again, the bassline).
For me, however, now, the real kill-
er on the album is Keep On Walking.
It starts with one of those eerie
synthetic chords straight out of a
Technicolor movie, before instantly
giving way to an incredibly crisp
sounding distorted guitar. The pro-
gression of the song is very obvious;
it is the most rock-like sounding of
the lot I reckon, but again the sing-
ing comes through and makes it that
little bit different.
All in all I’ve ended up getting the
impression that the singer has the
ability to contort his voice to suit any
style he’d like to do, when it doesn’t
come naturally to him.
What can I say to sum up? The
songs here demand attention; don’t
try doing any intellectual activ-
ity while listening to these (not that
most us do any of that anyway). On
the other hand, if you have any tidy-
ing/cleaning to do around all your
disgracefully messy domiciles, just
stick this on and time will fly. You
just can’t sit still while this stuff is
on!
It’s out this Monday guys and girls,
and far be it from me to say that this
album is a must-have, but it will put
a big smile on your face for at least
the rest of the week.

It’s high time for a Prodigy retrospective, and it arrives as a singles collection, reminding us
