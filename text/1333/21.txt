Over the past few weeks we’ve
been running a vote on who should
be Coffee Break’s new mascot, what
with us being bored of staring at The
Hoff’s inane grin and chiselled abs
all day. Unfortunately I hadn’t reck-
oned on the staggeringly immense
popularity of The Hoff, and you’ve
decided that you want him to stay.
Personally, I was looking forward
to sexy ladies adorning the page,
but as it is, there’s another year of
the hairy freak to look forward to.
Thanks guys.

Drinking puts hairs on your chest,
and also your head too from the look
of this picture. The Hoff is all-too-
fond of a drink, but can you tell us
his favourite tipple?
Baywatch: Softcore porn for sand
fetishists. Despite Hoff’s slightly
dodgy claims that the show saved
lives, we all know how poo it was.
Who’s Hoff’s co-star here?
No Hasselhoff feature is complete
without his crotch. One for the
ladies I think. The question practi-
cally writes itself. How big is Hoff’s
penis?
Knight Rider was the pinnacle of
Dave’s career in my opinion. What
was the name of Micheal Knight’s
‘boss’ in the show?
The Hoff’s finest hour: Knocking
down the Berlin Wall. His lowest:
Moaning about not getting enough
credit. What’s Hoff’s full name?
Dot-to-Hoff
