After weeks of voting, the
Conservative leader race has boiled
down to David Davis and David
Cameron, with Davis already pan-
ning massive tax cuts for families.
The vote will now go to all regis-
tered members of the Conservative
party, with a final result expected on
December 6th.
A US Senate commitee have reit-
erated claims that Respect MP
George Galloway (below) benefited
financially from the UN’s “Oil-for-
food” programme after a report was
released containing new evidence.
Mr. Galloway has denied any wrong-
doing claiming, “This is all a tissue
of lies and a lie doesn’t become a
truth through repetition”.
The United Kingdon is gearing up
for a general smoking ban to be in
place for 2007, with Health Secretary
Patricia Hewitt outlining a ban in all
public places in the governments
new health bill. All workplaces will
be covered by the ban, but pubs
which do not serve food and private
members clubs will be exempt from
the ban. Scotland, Northen Ireland
and Wales will introduce tougher
bans which will not include these
exemptions.
A fair deal for asylum?

New plans for immigration reveal some unfair changes to the system
Analysis
Matthew Hartfield
Politics Editor
Home Secretary Charles Clarke has claimed the new measures are
compatible with human rights legislation
without offical immigration status
for whatever reason; whether their
status has expired or they haven’t
been given permission to work. Alex
Gask, a legal officer for the civil
rights group Liberty, expressed
his concerns that this would worry
prospective employers and lead to
discrimination in an effort to keep
within the law; although in this
same bill the Government stated
they will issue guidelines to prevent
such discrimination when employ-
ing people.
The new asylum proposals will
also have an effect on students who
wish to study in the UK. The new
immigration bill will abolish the right
for students to appeal if their visa is
rejected. Since it was announced
at the meeting that around a third
of students who study in this coun-
try are from overseas (mainly in
areas such as science, engineering
and technology), this measure has
the potential to affect a significant
fraction of the student population.
Diana Warwick, the chief executive
of Universities UK, discussed the
point that students who have their
visas rejected for trivial reasons
(such as doubts over passing their
course) will find themselves strand-
ed, and cited the case of Sheffield
University, where nine out of ten
refusals are overturned before the
official appeal process.
I
n recent years the issue of
asylum and immigration has
become something of a hot
potato in politics; a topic which
is constantly brought up and
argued about, especially in the light
of the war on terror and the more
recent terrorist attacks on London.
As has been regularly reported,
the Labour government have intro-
duced a raft of measures to try
and tighten immigration into the
UK and to reduce the number of
asylum seekers entering the coun-
try; measures spurred on by various
right wing newspapers. However, at
a recent House of Commons meet-
ing discussing the Government’s
new Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Bill 2005, a number of
the recent and new plans were dis-
cussed, some of which do raise a
few alarms.
One of the main points that was
raised was a new section that was
introduced in the Treatment of
Claimants Bill of last year, in which
the government were given powers
to stop the benefits of failed asy-
lum seekers, and there were even
reports of threatening to remove
the children from their families, in
order to encourage their departure.
Tim Finch, a speaker for the refu-
gee council present at the meeting,
described these measures as, “cruel
and ineffective” and criticized the
Government for their feeling that,
“asylum has to be legislated non-
stop”.
The Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Bill will also outline new
guidelines on employment of asy-
lum seekers, introducing new pen-
alties for those who employ those
One of the more unsettling
admentments to the original 1971
act though is the provision to ena-
ble immigration officers to require
passengers on travel transport to
provide biometric information, such
as fingerprints and eye readings.
This seems to suggest that the
Government are getting ready to
roll out their identity card scheme
before it’s even cleared. Considering
the current kerfuffle over its current
cost (the LSE produced a report
stating that each ID card will cost
£300 each to create) and the poten-
tial to create an Orwellian state
(hysterically, it has been announced
that the planned ID cards are a
bit like your supermarket reward
cards, except that they’ll be able to
have information on which coun-
tries you’ve been to, where you’ve
had a health check up and what your
current criminal record is, as well as
that your cat prefers Whiskers) this
seems an almost underhand method
to get the ID plan started.
W
hen someone says,
“I’m looking forward
to taking my message
right round the coun-
try”, it is natural to
assume that the message must be
loud and clear, isn’t it? Why is it then
that when David Cameron utters
these words, people buy it?
There really seems to be no clear
cut message to take around, apart
from a fresh faced smile, some
sharp suited charisma and random
banter about hopes and dreams. A
recent Guardian/ICM poll showed
that he even has a 15 point lead over
Gordon Brown for being favoured as
Prime Minister by floating voters.
The stagnant Cameron bandwagon
Opinion
Ammar Waraich
Do experience and actual policies
not count for anything?
TheToriesaredesperateforpower;
desperate enough to try anything;
desperate enough infact to favour
a main man who is being openly
described by the media (and who
can blame them) as nothing more
than Tony Blair in a blue disguise.
If Cameron’s message is merely an
ambiguous Blair imitation, forgive
me for not getting excited.
Admittedly though, putting the
wooden David Davis (or even Liam
Fox) as head would only have suc-
cessfully elected the loser of the
next general election. The only
real option that the Conservatives
had was Ken Clarke, a heavyweight
political beast, and the only one who
could challenge New Labour. Some
suggested that it was slightly too late
for him and that he would have been
the ideal choice instead of Hague,
Iain Duncan-Smith or even Michael
Howard, who was given a free run. In
my opinion though his One Nation,
pro European take on Conservatism
would have been healthy for the
political world, stirring it enough to
take it in a fresh and constructive
direction. He was also the only man
who had the popularity and experi-
ence needed to modernise his party
credibly and effectively. The Tories,
however, in their desperation blew
their chances.
What does that leave the country
with? It leaves us with a stagnant
political scene with options that will
result in conditions not much dif-
ferent to what we have witnessed
for the past decade. There is a rea-
son why voters are more apathetic
than ever before! Gordon Brown
may now be by far our best shot at
the next elections but in all hon-
esty even that prospect is not one
to rejoice over; unless he can really
take hold of his party and steer it
in a totally new direction, where
initiatives like the so-called “Big
Conversation” or “Tough on Crime”
actually equate to something. Even
if Cameron is someone who can
instigate this change, then all the
hype and expectation will be justi-
fied. However, chances of this hap-
pening are slim.

to stop their benefits
