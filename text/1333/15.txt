All you’ll possibly need when you’re poor, have a party to go to and your skin’s a drag

Last week, while in Natwest,
the bank assistant commented
on what lovely skin I had. This
brightened my otherwise dull day
and I feel it’s not time to spill
the secrets of good skin. I swear
by drinking hot water and lemon
before bed. Not only does this
keep your skin crystal clear, but
it also helps me sleep well at
night (alas, many morning lec-
tures have been missed due to
this concoction!)
If you wake up after a week long
bender and your skin is caked
in make-up and feels dry and
unloved, try Lush’s Brazen Honey
face mask. It stings a little, but
after the treatment your skin feels
gloriously soft and kissable!
Alternatively, if you have a least a
week between one party and the
next, then try:
Dolly’s 5-day Detox
Days 1 and 2: Drink the required 8
glasses of water and moisturise in
the morning and evening.
Day 3: Your skin should have ade-
quate protection now, so use the
Brazen Honey face mask in the
evening and throughly moisturise
after use.
Day 4: Pluck eyerbrows, wax legs
(and other parts if required!). Use
Lush’s Dream Cream (£7.95) for
an all-over glow.
Day 5: Plan outfit, drink more
water, get out those heels - and
remember to swing those hips!

An eye on Fashion

This week’s article is on party fash-
ion. With Bonfire Night and several
Christmas parties coming up, I think
it’s essential to have a standard
party wardrobe that you can throw
on but still look fabulous. Last week
I went to a friend’s 21st birthday at
their house. The party contained
a surprising amount of fashionably
dressed girls and boys (finally peo-
ple have been taking heed of my
pearls of wisdom), which impressed
me greatly. However, there were
some who had clearly worn their
clothes for a week.
So, for girls to look great instantly
I’ve found some great dresses at
Topshop, from the Minkie range
(priced from £27.00 with student
discount). The dresses come in a
variety of patterns and materials,
from silk sixties flowers to cotton
paisley prints with sequins. The
dresses are surprisingly good value
considering that it’s a whole outfit
and once they’re on, all you need
is some great party make-up and a
good pair of stilettos.
As for the daring and uber fashion-
able guy, think Alexander McQueen
meets Brandon Flowers; lots of eye-
liner, suits and indie chic. But alas,
I fear many of you are quiet IC
boys who like nothing more than a
good physics equation, so for mini-
mal effort and maximal effect: wash
yourselves, comb that mop of curls
and throw on a clean t-shirt (which
