How are interviews
arranged?
The prospective employers
either go direct to the ap-
pointments representatives of
the Departments or deal with
the Secretary of the Board.
Most interviews are ar-
ranged for the Spring Term.
M a n y Departments h a v e
found it necessary to restrict
the days and times when
interviews may be held.
In some cases interviews
are preceded by a general
talk to interested students,
but arrangements vary ac-
cording to the wishes of the
particular company and the
views of the Department con-
cerned.
When the number of can-
didates is insufficient to jus-
tify a visit to the College by
an employer, arrangements
can usually be made for the
individual students to visit
the company.
Where do I get
Advice?
The Departmental repre-
sentative is freely available
to advise students about
careers, and sees them indi-
vidually or in small groups.
Careers advice is frequently
given to a postgraduate by
his supervisor.
To arrange for an inter-
view with one of the com-
panies visiting I.C. visit the
Departmental Careers officer
or the Departmental office.

but we expect our graduates to be worth much more in two or three
years' time when they are holding down their first management
appointments.
We are a British Company employing nearly 6,000 people and we
invent and manufacture high class precision machinery. About three
quarters of this is exported to every corner of the globe. As a com-
pany we live by our brains and we therefore devote a great deal of
care to developing the abilities of our staff.
This year we are looking for a small number of top grade graduates,
with the potential and ambition to develop quickly anc1
take respon-
sibility at an early age. We are particularly interested in engineers
but also have opportunities for a small number of scientists and arts
men.
