A moment of drama in an IC match
LC. stay top
I.C. Rugby Club was
founded between the wars,
drawing on the talents of
the Constituent College
teams, which themselves had
been among the best in the
country. At one time, a
Mines 1st X V had no less
than 6 senior county players.
Professor Sparkes, Presi-
dent of the RFC for many
years, was himself a first
class player as full-back for
Wasps 1st XV.
Since the war the club
has been very successful and
before 1962 won the U.L.
Gutteridge Cup seven years
in succession.
Stars
Many I.C. players have
gone on to play for the big
clubs, the three most recent
being Pete Ray (RAF and
Headingley), Clive Swinner-
ton (Rosslyn Park) and
John Kelly (Ebbw Vale and
Cross Keys).
I think it is time to say
that the Club's standard is
If the occupants of the
Sports Centre have seen six
representatives of the law
prowling around it was not
to investigate the loss of
drain pressure but to battle
against the I.C. Shooting
team. This match is always
looked forward to by the
club and this year's compe-
tition was not lacking in
hospitality from I.C. nor
match winning ability from
the Metropolitan Police.
The usual Chiswick full
bore match gave many sur-
prises, not the least being
that the I.C. team narrowly
lost to a much more experi-
enced team, so all looks
bright for our future full
bore commitments.
Side by Side
T h e s e highlights are

George Burton, a mem-
ber of IC Gliding Club, has
been awarded the Frank
Foster Trophy for complet-
ing the fastest 100 Km tri-
angle in Great Britain in
1968. On 12th April he flew
from Lasham to Fullerton
Junction to Hungerford and
back to Lasham at an aver-
age speed of 85 k.p.h. in his
SHK.
not as high as it was in the
'50s, but most College and
University sides find this
too. Undoubtedly the abol-
ishment of National Service
has had a lot to do with this
(the players taken are much
younger).
Fixtures
Nevertheless, the 1st X V
has a very strong fixture
list, playing (and often beat-
ing) such teams as Rich-
mond Vikings, Wasps Van-
dals, Bedford Wanderers
etc.— the 2nd XVs of the
large clubs. During the week
the 1st X V plays other Lon-
don Colleges and other
Universities, usually with
rare distinction.
Our excellent fixture lists
are due mainly to Gus Tur-
ner a now retired Miner of
many years standing, who
sweated blood at many
arduous fixture meetings. In
his footsteps Dr. Mike Cara-
bine of Chem. Eng. — the
only permanent member of
competitions ranging from
postal prone matches to side
by side encounters with
London colleges as well as
standing and kneeling shoot-
ing leagues. But this time of
year sees a particular frenzy
as the constituent collegiate
competition, the Courtmann
shield, is shot for, and in the
next few weeks the three
selected teams of eight will
fight it out.
Meanwhile all members
will (whether highly skilled
or not) be involved in the
internal competitions run
by the club which involve
nearly everything that can
be legally done with a gun
and a bullet, with fantastic
cash prizes and/or medals
and cups for the surviving
winners.

Last summer, Mr. Burton
represented Britain in the
World Championships which
were held at Leszno in
Poland. He competed in the
Open class, again flying his
SHK and came seventh, the
highest placed British pilot
in either of the two classes.
Mr. Burton joined the Club
in 1952, while he was at I.C.

the RFC — also works very
hard at the job, especially
at strengthening the lists for
the lower teams.
Among these lower teams
we have Ffagin's, who take
the A2 fixtures. They were
formed in the early '60's by
a disenchanted breakaway
group and have their own
tie. At times their strength
has rivalled the 1st XV, as
many ex-I.C. players con-
tinue to play for them.
B2's, B3's or
Bl's
We also have the B2s
who were the B3s and play
the Bl's fixtures. They are
a side of tremendous spirit,
very cliquey, and were led
by John Smithies of Chem-
istry 3 until he was spotted
by a talent scout and
whisked away to the 1st XV.
He is one of the old men
of the club, having been
here 5 years (on and off).
Another of the old men is
Tony Duke, Civil Eng. PG,
who has played for the 1st
X V and has been awarded
full colours for seven conse-
cutive years.
Present Captain is John
Ballard, ex-RCS, now of
Mines, who has been here
4 years. He was a 1st X V
regular last year until he
had to have a shoulder oper-
ation which, however, did
not prevent him playing on
tour!
Our record in the Gutte-
ridge Cup has not been too
good recently, although we
made the Final in 65-66 and
66-67, and the semi-final
last year. However, we did
manage to win the U L
' Sevens' competition last
year.
Blood-bath
Towards the end of the
season we have an annual
blood-bath — the Sparkes
Cup, when Guilds (hold-
ers), Mines and RCS fight it
out. The Cup is usually pre-
sented by the Prof, himself
at the Annual Dinner which
always boasts many other
illustrious guests such as
Brian Stoneman, Bob Tay-
lor, John Young & Co.
Dublin Again
After the Dinner all that
is left is the Tour. All? In
previous years D u b l i n ,
Southern France and Brus-
sels have been blessed with
our presence and it is Dub-
lin's turn again this year.
The Tour team will be
determined to retain its
recent unbeaten tour record.
Sports
comment
The I.C.W.A. Hockey team
did well on Saturday to come
back after being 1-0 down to
win their U.L. Cup match
against Q.M.C. 3-2. — Our
congratulations and best
wishes for the next round.
The College has been very
lucky in getting £600 or so
from the reserve funds to
equip the new weight training
room and effect other altera-
tions in the Sports Centre.
The weight training room
should be ready by the end
of term.
It is sad to record that the
1st X V went down fighting in
their cup game against Wye
College, 12-8. An interesting
point is that Wye scored no
tries but kicked four penalty
goals, most of them for minor
infringements. There must be
a case for reducing the
penalty goal to 2 pts. especi-
ally when one considers the
effect of a Camberabero on
an International match. The
classic case is of a British
Lions game against the A l l
Blacks. The All Blacks won
18-17, Don Clarke kicking 6
penalty goals.
This term sees the begin-
ning of a build up of train-
ing, both on land and on
water, which culminates
this term with the head of
the river races. These are
professional races rowed
over three to four miles
against the clock and suc-
cessful results demand a
high standard of fitness.
During the early part of the
term the emphasis is on
distance rowing but there
Last Wednesday at their
home course in Richmond
Park the IC first team
increased their lead in the
London C o l l e g e s Cross
Country League by just four
points in an exceedingly
exciting race. The course
was very muddy after the
torrential rains and the huge
field of 170 started at a fast
pace. Immediately two IC
runners were up the front—
Nick Barton and Norman
Morrison—while the rest of
the IC team packed in the
thirties. At this stage, Bor-
ough Road P.E. College,
who are second in the lea-
gue, had their runners
packed well up. At the fin-
ish 5£ miles later Nick Bar-
ton finished in second place
and Norman Morrison third.
There was quite a gap until
the next IC runners came in
— Barry Dobrowski 26th,
Ashley Deans 31st and Dave
Pinkard 32nd completed the
IC scoring.
The second team packed in
well and were all in by nine-
tieth position, thus keeping
up their good sixth position.
The third and fourth teams
are one or two ' sprint'
races over a mile. One of
these is the Southern Uni-
versities' championship re-
gatta held at Reading on
February 15th where we
shall be defending our posi-
tion as champions and hol-
ders of the trophy—a very
elegant shield.
The standards of the five
regular crews cover the com-
plete range of A.R.A. status,
also maintained their places
in League II.
Trophy Win
So far this term IC have
beaten LSE and London
Hospitals and had one
match cancelled. The first
Saturday of term was the
QMC 1\ mile race. IC did
extremely well here, finish-
ing third overall to Cam-
bridge and Leeds. They car-
ried off the John Banks
Trophy for the first London
College home. However 1\
miles will seem easy to some
members of the team after
they have run in the
Nationals at Parliament Hill
on March 1st which is over
a course of 9 miles.
Relay
The Hyde Park Relay is
coming up soon on Febru-
ary 15th and anybody will-
ing to help in organisation
for the expected 110 teams
will be very welcome. We
have almost 700 athletes to
cope with.
and it is from those that the
crews for the summer re-
gatta and for Henley will
be chosen.
For those interested, the
boat club is open to mem-
bers of the College on Boat
Race day which is on 5th
April this year. An excellent
view of the crews near the
start at Putney can be
obtained.
