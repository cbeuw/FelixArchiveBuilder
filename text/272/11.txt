RCSU debate ICWA
Once again, inquoracy
caused the last IC Union
meeting to close early, after
only two motions had been
proposed.
It was declared at the be-
ginning of the meeting that,
for this year, the number of
freshers in Halls of Residence
would remain constant, a de-
cision taken by council fol-
lowing the previous Union
meeting; and a letter from
the FELIX' editor was read
to the meeting condemning
another decision by council,
namely the refusal to donate
£25 to Mr. Garby, FELIX
printer for the past 14 years.
Question time was taken
up with complaints about
lunchtime Refectory queues,
and requests that another
cashier be found to ease the
congestion at the cash desk.
In reply, Jeff Steer said that
this would be too costly, des-
pite the fact that the refec-
tories made a profit of £4,000
last year, and that queues
could be avoided by students
eating at "off-peak hours".
This was g r e e t e d with
derision from the house in
general and C. C. Parker in
particular, and it was pointed
out that with a turnover of
over a quarter of a million,
the refectories could well
afford the relatively small
cost of a part time cashier.
Morade
The first motion was pro-
posed by Vinod Garga, and
was carried over from the
previous meeting before the
quorum was challenged, vis
whether or not to give £25
to MORADE, the movement
to reorganise art education. A
vote resulted in the motion's
defeat by 119 to 79.
Pandemonium
The advertised main att-
raction, the motion to allow
women into the at present all-
male bar, was then proposed
by Adolf Hashteroudian. His
arrival at the microphone
was welcomed by pandemon-
ium, paper darts, cries of
"off" and a proposal to move
the next business;—defeated,
The flat belonging to Brian
Taylor and John Butterworth
(Butty — Chairman of RCS
Ents.) in Earls Court was
burgled in the early hours of
Monday, 27th January.
At 2.45 a.m. Brian Taylor
woke to find a burglar search-
ing the flat with a candle.
When asked what he was
doing, the burglar dropped
the valuables and the pile of
RCS Carnival tickets that he
was holding and fled.
or so Chairman Rex Lowin
judged. Les Ebdon com-
plained about the row and
the din abated long enough
to allow Adolf to make his
speech. The absence of wo-
men in the Union bar, he
maintained, was causing at-
tendance there to fall, result-
ing in a loss of £500 com-
pared with Southside bar's
loss of only £200. Also, the
colour television in the Union
was falling into disuse as
more and more students went
over to Southside for their
evenings entertainments.
The motion lost a possible
seconder, P a m Horrocks,
when Adolf accepted an
amendment from M a r t i n
Bland that men should be
allowed into the ICWA
lounge, and she later made a
speech for the abstentions,
accepting that women be kept
out of the Union Bar if the
behaviour in Southside im-
proved. Opposition was pro-
vided by John Andrews, who
said the activities in the
Union bar were not for wo-
men to see or hear, but Dave
Christopher, taking over as
the proposal seconder, asked
the men in the audience if
they never considered the
possibility that women could
have minds as putrid as their
own. After the opposition
was ably supported by Barry
Hood, who derided the
" orange squash drinkers"
proposing the motion and
warning all the ladies present
of the strange characters to
be found in the all-male bar,
the motion was defeated
without a count.
Finally, a motion concern-
ing the plight of soviet Jewry
was greeted by a mass exodus
from the hall, and the calling
of the quorum was left as a
formality.
Fortunately the main ent-
rance to the flat was locked
and Brian was able to pre-
vent the burglar from making
his escape while John
"Butty" phoned the police.
In spite of the burglar's
statement to the police that
he was just 'looking for
friends', he will appear before
the West London Magistrates
Court on a charge of break-
ing and entering.
With an agenda consisting
mainly of Constitutional mat-
ters, the R.C.S.U. meeting on
Tuesday 28th drew a giant
crowd of 64(!) to Chem.
lecture theatre A.
The motion putting the
Academic Affiairs Officer on
I.C. Council in place of the
RCSU Rep was passed nem
con. Since, it was claimed,
P.G.'s are at present left out,
apart from staff and students,
a proposal to give them a rep
on the general committee was
also approved.
Next, a request for opinion
on the future of ICWA,
which is alleged to use too
much money for little pur-
pose. Pam Horrocks pointed
out the use of ICWA's social
functions for girls straight
from school "who don't know
what MEN are". Those men
present voted ICWA obse-
The swimming gala this
year was fortunately not
ruined by the permanganate-
maniacs who have domina-
ted previous non-events. It
was held this year in our
own pool and despite some
doubt amongst the publicists
as to the starting time it
started at 7.15 p.m.
Spectators were limited to
150, each one being eligible
for a free pint in the Union
Lower Lounge afterwards.
R.C.S. won the Gala by
lete, but actual Icwarians
were split 50/50.
There followed an equally
vague discussion on I.C.
Exec, which is alleged to
abuse its intended powers to
act in emergency only, and to
take some decisions against
general student opinion. No
firm decision was reached.
CHALLENGE
A challenge from ICWA to
the general committee for an
obstacle race down the South
Ken. subway has been accep-
ted. Another challenge, from
Guilds, to a tug-of-war across
the Round Pond was also
accepted provided Dermott
Corr acts as middle marker
on the rope. It was also sug-
gested an unwanted and un-
loved Davy Lamp join him
there. Both these events will
be during Carnival week.
winning the mens' breast
stroke, free style and back
stroke races as well as all
the womens' races. Mines
dominated the water polo,
winning both their matches.
The spectators were ade-
quately entertained after the
event by such personalities
as Sue Lowin, Martin Bland
and Dave Wield, not to
mention Mr. Spooner, tak-
ing to the water fully
clothed — with a little per-
suasion, of course. Everyone
then made their way to the
Union Lower Lounge to sup
their free liquor.
Mines
Last week's meeting was
attended by the same fifty
people who always turn up,
however this time the Hon.
Sec, Mr. Barry Hood arrived
early.
Reports on the Mines Ball
and Foreign Students Week
were made: a loss of only £20
was made on the Mines' Ball
and it is hoped to make up
this deficit by showing films.
In connection with Mines'
Foreign Students Week, some
Mines' students have been
invited abroad. The method
of selection had been revised
by the Council and was put
before the Union for sug-
gestion and approval.
Inevitably the situation at
LSE was brought up and
caused some fairly heated
arguments. Several badly
worded motions were put for-
ward and after a muddled
debate—a second motion was
put forward before discussion
on the first was finished —
voting on the motions was
abandoned. A suggestion
was made that Mines should
re-occupy U L U , but this
faded away as the meeting
was ended by half the people
walking out.
Finals
Physics III received a stun-
ning blow recently when it
was suddenly sprung on them
that the finals had been put
forward two weeks and will
now begin on May 19th. Be-
cause of this the Summer
Term timetable is being com-
pressed to give at least a few
days between the end of lec-
tures and the beginning of
exams. This has been neces-
sitated by the uncertainty of
the staff of how the new unit
system will work out. The
staff want to leave time for
the papers to be marked and
for external examiners to
interview all borderline cases
before the end of term.
The action of the staff in
submitting the new exam
dates to ULU before telling
any third year students or
discussing it on the staff-
student committee represents
a serious breakdown in rela-
tions and has caused much
bad feeling amongst the third
years.
Student Banned
At a meeting of Council on
Tuesday 28th January, a Mr.
Worthington was charged
with various disciplinary of-
fences including punching a
Hop doorman and smashing
glasses. He was sentenced to
being banned from all Union
facilities, excluding refec-
tories, for the rest of the term.
ICWA reach
Hockey final
IC 3 QMC 2
In a very rough semi-final
match last Saturday ICWA
pulled up from being 2-nil
down against the run of play
to win 3-2 in the last five
minutes.
Near half-time and straight
after QMC's highly contro-
versial second goal, a dashing
solo effort by the centre-for-
ward gave us our first goal.
In the second half ICWA did
most of the attacking and
after a rather scrambled
second goal, finally got the
winner a few minutes from
time.
ICWA will now meet
either UC or Goldsmiths in
the final of the ULU Cup in
a months time.
Saracens
defeat
LC.
IC 1st XV 11 pts.
Saracens Ex. 1st 20 pts.
Although the scoreline is
quite just, this very good
game was by no means a
walk over for the Saracens.
I.C. kicked off into a
strong wind and after an
early Saracen attack was re-
pulsed, went into the lead
with a well kicked penalty by
Bell. Saracens fought back
strongly scoring two tries and
a penalty to be 9-3 up at half
time.
With the wind helping I.C.
most of the play was in the
Saracens h a l f but they
showed their class with two
breakaway tries, and with a
penalty were 20 pts. to 6 up,
Bell having kicked another
penalty for I.C.
Not to be outdone I.C.
raised a storming finish scor-
ing a fine try in the corner
through Sullivan. Bell com-
pleted a great afternoon's
kicking by converting from
the touchline.
