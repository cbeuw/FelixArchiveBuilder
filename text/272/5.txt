TO CONFORM OR NOT T O CONFORM
" There are two types of
Hell" said George Axelrod.
" There is the Hollywood
studio hell where they nail
you to a cross, shove red-hot
pokers up your backside and
set fire to your feet; and
there is Italian studio hell
where they nail you to a
cross, shove red-hot pokers
up your backside and set fire
to your feet—the difference ?
. . . In Italian hell they lose
the nails, break the poker
and usually can't get the fire
started." To George Axelrod,
whose notable successes to
date include " The Manchur-
ian Candidate " and " Lord
Love a Duck ", this humor-
ous anecdote held the crux
of the debate on the relative
merits and demerits of the
Hollywood and Italian film
schools respectively. His new
film "The Secret Life of an
American Wife " (Rialto X)
is not only from Hollywood
and about Hollywood but is
also a quite discernible anti-
dote to the highly fashionable
expressionism and surrealism
of the Italian trend. It never-
theless conveys a spirit of
authenticity linked with in-
sight, to give a humane base
to what is really a fairy tale.
73 Sycophants
There can be no director,
with the possible exception
of Billy Wilder, who is better
equipped to portray the
pathetically humorous side
of American culture than
Axelrod—and m a i n t a i n
throughout a seriousness
evoked from he instant iden-
tification with the characters
with oneself. Wather Mat-
thau, whose expressions do
for comedy what Paul New-
man's do for brevity, plays
an inscrutable, inflexible and
incorrigible in-actor—a film
star with 73 sycophants tend-
ing his wildest whim and
twice as many hangers on
boring him to death. Anne
Jackson plays the wife of his
P.R. man whose rise to suc-
cess stems from a gourmet's
palate and the ability to hold
liquor. Their marriage is at
that boring stage where her
concern is her apparently
waning sex-appeal and his
biggest worry is being at the
right place at the right time,
the common denominator be-
ing the aspiring neighbour-
hood where the women go
about in sneakers between
P.T.A. meetings—where they
talk about brats—and super-
sophisticated cocktail parties
where they also talk about
brats !
A desperate impulse takes
the wife on an errand as a
call girl where she crosses
paths with the actor. An un-
typical combination of chick-
en soup and schoolgirl gossip
(she once slept with her Pro-
fessor of creative writing)
which all good American
housewives should have had
—has him mystified for only
a while and thereafter the
two complement each other
in a revealing of " the true
me". They achieve perfect
harmony and part the re-
spective owners of a rich
experience.
Let there be no misunder-
standing that this is a com-
edy. Axelrod wants you to
laugh as much as you can.
No high-falutin analysis of
the film is necessary—it is
delightfully simple and leaves
little to the imagination.
There is, however, the afore-
mentioned strain of pathos
—not of the "actor" who
ultimately reveals that he is
the shrewdest man in the
film—but for the housewife
whose glorious high-school-
and-college education counts
for nought when her values
are construed as those which
best fit the sterility of the
materialism in which she
lives. The film starts with her
gullible and impressionable
and it ends with her the
same way. It has given us a
good laugh and a lot of in-
sight in between.
Conformity is what Lind-
say Anderson's "If . . . "
(Paramount X) is all about
—the worst kind of conform-
ing that is since it is enforced.
When you hear that this film
exposes the Public School
system you will not fly into
tantrums of enthusiasm, for
it's been done so many times
before. Anderson has called
the film " visionary" and
therefore it would be ex-
pected to contain the usual
bumbling housemasters, mat-
rons whose maternal instincts
have never been quite satis-
fied, h e a d m a s t e r s who
announce that they PER-
SONALLY, will be taking
the seniors for " Business
Management" and victim-
ised masters whose biggest
trials are the Juniors for
" Rugger " and the chapel for
boredom. It does contain all
these prerequisites but the
brutality of the hierarchial
system, the bullying, the
warped values and the com-
pletely intractable repression
of the human soul are really
the background to a deeper
story.
Aggressive drop
out
Amongst the initial parody
of the Public School which
forms the first part of the
film, there emerges the char-
acter of Mick—from his first
appearance a drop-out whose
aggressive and animalistic
traits are due to a disposition
more sinister than immature.
His personaity is one of feral
origin and we soon see that
it is the most uncouth and
violent aspects which the
oppressiveness of his life
brings out. Such a person in
such a place is inevitably per-
secuted and in " If . . . " this
is relentless and horribly
cruel . . . at this point the
action is interspersed with
fantasy but there is a linger-
ing reluctance to console one-
self with the facile and typi-
cally British " it couldn't
happen here " attitude. Now
we do not laugh; with the
exception of the hero and
fellow conspirators the char-
acters become Dickensian in
their respective barbarism
and imbecility. The ominous
confinement of the " revolu-
tionary fire" can only now
be released by a cataclysmic
explosion—a nightmare of
shattered ribs, bullet-ridden
bodies and screaming women
—a gruesome ending to a
film about Public Schools !
But is it about public
schools ? All the current re-
views, which are plentiful,
criticise the film for not giv-
ing enough indications of
who are the partisans of such
a revolt which they consider
is simply a miniature of the
" Impending " deluge which
we are to experience in Brit-
ain. Thus the Public School
in " If . . ." is relegated to
the status of a microcosm of
Society—the fate of the two
being in similar proportion.
To me, this analogy is not
entirely valid. The most
meaningful scene is the final
one where Mick's machine
gun—turned on us, the audi-
ence—spits a holocaust-sound
effects par excellence. His
facial expression is one of
tragic heroism—tragic be-
cause he too is under a hail
of fire from his oppressors
and heroic because his is a
just cause. Anderson himself
lived in India at a time when
the Iron Fist of Her Majesty's
Government met violence
with violence in sufficient
proportion to obliterate most
of the Hindu insurgents. I
therefore conclude that the
message of " If . . ." is this.
There is a futility in violent
insurrection because the en-
tity—be it h i e r a r c h y or
status-quo which you seek to
obliterate—has the resources
the strength and the deter-
mination to survive when
your own very last drop of
blood has dried on the pave-
ment—go and see "If . . ."

RECORD REVIEWS
by Phemius
A Door and a half
At the time of writing, the
Doors are high in the U.S.
charts with ' Touch M e '
(Elektra EKSN 45050). With
this powerful, unsubtle num-
ber they look certain to re-
peat their American success.
Good B side—I like it.
Now, a bit of nostalgia
for the old folks, with Errol
Daniel's 'Go Back' (Para-
dox PAK45902). It even has
a saxophone break ! ! ' Why '
by Lonnie Mack (Elektra
EKSN 45404) is quite attrac-
tive. I prefer the B side which
is a good instrumental ver-
sion of Chuck Berry's ' Mem-
phis '. Duster Bennett, the
all-singing, all-dancing one
man rock band, has a single
out, called ' Raining in my
heart' (Blue Horizon 57-
3148). He really does play
everything at once (I saw
him on the telly), and it
sounds nice.
NOW FOR SOME L.P.S
Saga PSY 30003—
Jack Emery in ' A Remnant'
' A Remnant' is a one-man
show drawn from the novels
and plays of Samuel Beckett.
It was compiled by Frank
Doherty, a'lecturer at Keele.
Jack Emery first performed
this work at the New Univer-
sities Festival in 1966, while
a student at Keele. Since then
he has performed at the
Edinburgh Festival, and in a
'Festival of One-Man Shows'
at the Theatre Royal, Wind-
sor, together with such actors
as Sir John Gielgud and
Robert Morley.
Jack Emery's solo perform-
ance, recorded here in its
entirety, has won universal
critical acclaim from notables
like Harold Hobson of the
Sunday Times. The virtuosity
and power of this perform-
ance has everywhere been
praised, and Felix isn't about
to make an exception.
Island ILPS 9092—
Fairport Convention
"What we did on our
holidays."
This is the second L.P. by
this British group, whose line
up includes 5 men, 1 girl and
a big yellow dog. Their music
is a curious blend of English
traditional folk music and
contemporary electronic pop,
a strange but surprisingly ef-
fective mixture. This L.P.
contains 12 diverse tracks and
it is difficult to pick out par-
ticular tracks for comment,
they are all very good. I liked
" Mr. Lacy", a nitty-gritty
blues rocker, featuring Prof.
Bruce Lacy's machine whir-
ring away in the background,
and also "Meet on the ledge",
the record chosen for release
as a single. Their arrangement
of traditional songs "Not-
tamun Town" (Dylan nicked
the tune for "Masters of
War") & "She moves through
the fair" — are brilliantly
original. Sounding Pentangle-
like at times they combine
traditional vocal harmonies
with rhythm and guitar work
drawing its inspiration from
Indian and African sources.
"Fotheringay" is a beautiful
ballad in the Elizabethan
style of Byrd, a simple com-
bination of clear penetrating
female voice and soft guitar
backing.
A very good L.P., very
varied and well produced.
Highly recommended.
