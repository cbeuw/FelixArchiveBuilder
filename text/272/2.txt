Emergency motion at Guilds
condemns student militants
At an emergency Union
meeting of City and Guilds
last Friday, a motion was
passed expressing disapproval
of the recent action of certain
L.S.E. students at U.L.U. 650
students were present and
the meeting was also attended
by several members of the
national press.
The meeting was decided
upon at extremely short
notice on Thursday, when
Phil Marshall decided to pro-
pose the motion. Despite the
short time, at 1.10 p.m. on
Friday, when the meeting
started, ME. 220 was packed
with normal everyday engin-
eers. The opposition to the
motion was small and disor-
ganised.
The motion was read out
by Dermott Corr, Guild's
President and was as follows:
1. We deplore and dis-
associate ourselves from any
call to use violent means in
the settlement of internal
problems.
2. In particular we de-
plore the activities of certain
students of the L.S.E. for
their recent actions at U.L.U.
3. We do not think the
rights and wrongs of the in-
ternal situation at L.S.E. in
any way affect our disap-
proval of the activities of a
militant minority.
4. Staff / Student relation-
ships within this college are
of a very high standard and
we wish to take no action
which will prejudice any
future internal discussions.
5. We wish to be made
known to those people out-
side the College who may try
to gain support for student
violence from the students of
City and Guilds College that
they have no general support.
6. Further we can call
upon I.C. Union to forbid the
use of Union property and
facilities to those who wish
to cause trouble at this col-
lege.
Paragraph 3 was slightly
different originally but was
amended to the above at the
beginning of the meeting.
Marshall, claiming to be an
" ordinary fed-up student "
proposed the motion to a, for
once, reasonably quiet atten-
tive Guilds, in a speech last-
ing about five minutes. He
said that he had been influ-
enced to propose the motion
[because a letter had been
sent to the Rector by some
students asking him, amongst
other things, not to erect
"prison type gates" at this
college as at L.S.E. "This
meeting," he said, " is to
show that we in Guilds did
not send this letter." He
asked Guilds to make it
known that I.C. is no hotbed
of revolutionary fervour and
that militant students will
have no support here. "We
must make it crystal clear
that we are warning off Tariq
Ali and rent-a-mob" he said.
Marshall received a rousing
applause for his speech.
Against the motion, Paul
Ekins of E.E.I., said that as
Mr. Marshall did not under-
stand the situation at L.S.E.
his comments were invalid.
He also wanted para. 6
deleted but this amendment
was defeated.
After a few short speeches
for and against, the motion
was carried by 579 votes for,
50 against, with 21 absten-
sions.
LETTER SENT TO PENNEY
On Thursday 30th, a meet-
ing was held in the college to
gain support for the march
from U L U to LSE in protest
against the closing of the
school. The most important
decision of the meeting was,
however, to send an open
letter to Lord Penney.
This letter calls upon Pen-
ney to give firm assurances
that no "prison type gates"
will be erected here, that
"police will never be invited
onto the campus for political
purposes", that "academic
freedom will not be infringed
for commercial or govern-
ment interest" and that pol-
itical freedom here will be
safeguarded and no students
victimised for their political
views. It goes on to ask Pen-
ney to use "every influence"
to demand that LSE is re-
opened for study and all
charges and legal actions
against the students for their
political views be dropped.
It also asks the Rector to
explain to the LSE administ-
ration that "students are
worthy of being treated as
adults and consulted before
action is taken".
It was felt at the meeting
that the letter was necessary
after what happened at LSE
and that if Penney rejected
the letter it would help
students to become more
politically aware.

TO SIT OR NOT TO SIT?
THE PRESIDENTS DECIDE
Following the occupation
of U.L.U., on Monday 27th
January, by a group of
students from L.S.E. together
with various sympathisers,
U.L.U. Presidents council
were still discussing the situ-
ation at 7.30 on Tuesday.
They eventually informed the
occupants of the terms
offered by the U.L.U. Man-
agement Committee; that
they could use U.L.U. for
meetings so long as they
obeyed the normal hours of
opening.
OPINIONS DIFFER
The debate that was going
on showed a marked division
of opinion. There were those
(mostly L.S.E. students)
specifically concerned with
the situation at the L.S.E.,
who felt that any further con-
frontation with the authorities
would hinder the chances of
a quick re-opening of the
School. The other faction felt
that the situation was no
longer a specific L.S.E.
struggle, but that U.L.U.
should be used as a base for
revolution.
CONFUSION
After a bitter debate, Paul
Hoch called a vote at 9.10 on
the question of whether the
sit-in should continue. The
L.S.E. students alone decided
to call it off, but the meeting
as a whole felt that it should
continue. The meeting then
broke up temporarily in con-
fusion, with the defeated
spokesmen trying to continue
the debate.
Meanwhile, in the U.L.U.
office, the Presidents were
discussing three alternative
plans: that the sit-in should
be allowed to continue, that
the police should be called in,
or alternatively that the
medical students, who were
reported to be assembling for
some direct action of their
own, should be called in. It
soon became apparent that
there would be no alternative
but to accept the third plan,
as the medical students had
already arrived, and had be-
gun to clear the concert hall.
The Presidents thus decided
to go to the concert hall to
try to ensure the evacuation
was as smooth as possible.
This they did by holding" the
doors open to allow a free
flow out of the hall. One
member of I.C. council was
escorted out with the help of
Rex Lowin.
LOOSE SCRUM
The only trouble occurred
in the entrance, where a num-
ber of medics had to form an
impromptu loose scrum in
order to remove a group of
dissenting anarchists. Two
groups decided to continue
their political discussion in
Malet Street, to the accom-
paniment of strains of :"Go
home, you bums".
"WE SHOULD H A V E STAYED
TO START THE REVOLUTION
Protest last Tuesday week Jewish community held a the previous day. There were
centred on the Iraqi embassy s ; i e n t
in Queens' Gate opposite the vigil in pro.es, agains, S „ g ! T
Physics building, when the the hanging of 9 Jews in Iraq crowd.
After two contradictory
votes at successive LSE
Union meetings on the re-
moval of the symbolic gates,
the militants won and the
gates came down at 8.30 on
Friday 24th January. The
police moved in and made
arrests on conspiracy charges
after some Professors had
pointed out known militants.
One of those arrested was
Graham Thomson from I.C.
LSE was then closed offici-
ally by the Director Dr.
Adams.
OCCUPY!
On Monday a meeting of
LSE and other students was
held in ULU to discuss the
use of rooms there while LSE
was closed. As is understand-
able, the Management Com-
mittee were not helpful and
at about 9.00 p.m. the de-
cision to occupy was taken.
The reasons given were "to
obtain a safe base for com-
munications, publicity and
meeting purposes; and to do
Travel
Agency
The travel agency in the
Union is now in operation in
Committee room B (by the
bar). Bookings can be made
directly for journeys handled
by German Student Travel
Service and Students Travel
Bureau (Italy). Information
is also available on many
other aspects of travel. The
agency is open initially on
Mondays 1-2 p.m. and Thurs-
days 1-2.30 p.m.
something which will hit the
National headlines and en-
courage sympathy action in
other Universities". About
six IC students were among
those who stayed the night
in U L U where a peculiar
mixture of anarchy and self-
discipline reigned.
EXODUS
On Tuesday a meeting of
the occupiers decided to leave
the building voluntarily in
spite of some who said "We
55
should have stayed to start
the revolution". The exodus
began at 10.30 p.m. and the
Rugby players from the
RVC, who turned up to
t h r o w the occupiers out
forcibly, only hindered by
blocking the steps to those
leaving. They did however
remove a few Maoists who
wanted to stay on.
After these dramatic inci-
dents last Thursday, LSE's
National Day of Solidarity,
passed off quietly.
Extraordinary Meeting
On Thursday 13th Febru-
ary, at 1 p.m., there will be
an extraordinary meeting of
the Imperial College Union.
For this meeting, in the Con-
cert Hall, G. A. C. Assimakis
has proposed a motion that a
referendum should be held to
reflect on some vital points
of the I.C.U. Constitution.
If the motion is passed
only two thousand votes on
the referendum will be final
and could result in a com-
plete change in the structure
of I.C. The referendum
questions such things as the
existance of the constituent
colleges and I.C.W.A. along
with the possibility of I.C.
joining the N.U.S. The
motion is relevant to the
work of the Constitutional
Reform Committee, which is
at present looking for im-
provements in the I.C. Con-
stitution.

this college from 1948-51

dancing was provided couresy

The largest dinner ever to
be held in Southside took
place last Friday on the oc-
casion of the annual Engin-
eers Dinner and Dance. 440
people attended the dinner
and more than 600 were at
the dance.
