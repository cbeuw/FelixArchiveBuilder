COMMENT
I N T R O D U C I N G T E N S I O N
As students of this college, we may or may not have followed
with concern the recent events at L.S.E. We should however
be concerned that the events at L.SE. will not be repeated at
this college. In this context the views expressed in the letter
to the Rector (reported on page two) are correct in that they
seek assurances that police will never be invited onto the
campus for political purposes, that no students will be victim-
ised for their political views and that academic freedom will
not be infringed under any circumstance. What is disquieting
is that the letter, especially the latter part asking him to
interfere with the L.S.E. situation, is putting Penney in a very
tricky position. If Penney rejects the letter out of hand,
student 'militants' can talk about possible future 'victimis-
ation'. If Penney accepts the letter and its contents, then his
action will only precipitate further demands. Either way, the
possibility of unrest at this college becomes more apparent.
And this is wrong! Any action which introduces tension into
a situation where it does not already exist is unwise. Although
the ideals expressed in the letter are a commendable expres-
sion of an individual's rights, the sending of the letter is an
irresponsible thing to have done.

You will by now have heard about the Guilds union
meeting last Friday. A lot of people wanted to express a
feeling of dissatisfaction with the use of violence as a tool of
student policy. I am broadly in agreement with this, and
yet I didn't vote for the motion. My reasons are these: the
motion was pushed through the meeting far too fast—
opposing speakers were jeered and shouted down (read the
national papers if you don't believe this); and Phil Marshall's
emotive speech was totally unworthy of a complex and
difficult motion of this type. As an exercise in reasoned
debate, the meeting was about as fruitful as the average
Guilds union meeting. Not that I blame Marshall or Corr
for the way the meeting was run—toss a reasoned argument
at Guilds and they wouldn't know what to make of it. No
thinking, rational individual could vote for a motion contain-
ing as many varied propositions as this without at least some
discussion and clarification of the issues involved. Two out
of the six clauses were 'discussed' for a total of time of about
six minutes. One is forced to conclude that the majority of
people at the meeting behaved in an irrational manner. After
all, shouting people down is so much less effort than listening
to what they have to say. Marshall may not like the stigma
attached to being a student; I am ashamed to be a member
of Guilds Union.

Anxiety for Soviet Jews
Sir,
We would like to express
our anxiety about the wors-
ening situation of the Jewish
community in the U.S.S.R.
We feel that it is essential
that the Soviet Union guar-
antees to its Jewish citizens :
(a) the same rights as other
citizens;
(b) cultural and institu-
tional facilities equal to those
available to other Soviet
nationalities;
(c) facilities for the prac-
tice of the Jewish religion
equal to those available to
believers of other religious
denominations, and the right
to maintain contact with co-
religionists;
Sir,
I would like to reply to
the number of comments
made in your last issue about
the Overseas Students Com-
mittee.
The Overseas Students
Committee as defined by its
constitution is a Committee
looking after the welfare of
Overseas Students in the
College.
Its aims are to assist the
foreign students to adapt
themselves to the British
way of life and customs, and
to help them integrate with
the rest. At the beginning of
the year it runs a reception
centre in committee room B

say " We agree with this
letter but do wish to sign
it in case our support on
this issue might be used at
some time in the future,
by organisations outside
I.C., to transform public
sympathy for the Jews in
the U.S.S.R., to sympathy
with ISRAELI actions in
the Middle East".
the College staff and various
student officials. Inquiries of
all kinds (Financial hardship,
accommodation, etc.) are an-
swered throughout the year.
Therefore, it could hardly
be argued that the Overseas
Students Committee is just
a welcoming committee play-
ing host to the Overseas
freshers as implied by Les
Edbon's column last week. It
is a committee which looks
after the problems of Over-
seas students, and is elected
by the Overseas Students as
it only affects them.
Yours sincerely,

Renbourne
Visitors to Folk Club last
week were lucky enough to
hear Jacqui MacShee sing
with the advertised guests,
John Renbourne and Terry
Cox. Together, of course,
they comprise three-fifths of
the Pentangle.
As one would expect, their
polished performance was
very well received (except for
one oafish member of the
audience, who insisted on
shouting that he'd paid to
see John Renbourne and
would the others piss off).
John is obviously developing
his interests in early English
music, and performed several
songs with Terry Cox (guitar
and glockenspiel playing lute
parts).
Among them was the beau-
tiful ' Lord Salisbury '. Terry
also sang something of his
own, accompanying himself
on the hand drums.
Fad of
separatism
On the subject of the last IC
Union meeting . . .
What, really made me
wonder about the future of
' our' Union was the neces-
sity for even proposing a
motion that females should be
ALLOWED to go into the
Union Bar with subsequent
amendment that males should
be ALLOWED to go into the
ICWA lounge and what was
even more shocking was that
the motion was defeated. This
is sheer discrimination that
people should be told where
they can and cannot go in
their own Union Building, a
Union which all support with
their subscriptions; it should
be left up to individual Union
members which Bar, lounge
or room they wish to use and
not be decided by some
ethereal drunkard. It is this
whole fad of separatism at
this College that puts the
Union in the lamentable state
it is in at present; it perme-
ates all the way through the
College, making the Union
building—which should be
the centre of College social
life—the object of derision
of students here and else-
where, when the only sound
issuing from it in the evening
is loud, drunken singing.
What also is the point of
ICWA (the ICWA lounge
could be put to far better use
by some College organisation
such as HENRY); this is just
an extension of the Union
Bar rule. Surely we have
passed the stage of regarding
women as tender objects,
easily offended but to be kept
on hand to show off to and to
use as copulating machines.
Are we all such schizophrenics
that we must have such differ-
ent types of behaviour in dif-
ferent places ? If this type
of segregation continues fur-
ther we will soon be having
' No Coloureds' sign in the
Union but I hope people in
the Union will use rationality
and even basic principles of
democracy and not let ridicu-
lous prejudices affect their
reason. A L L Union members
—and their guests—should
be able to use A L L Union
facilities.

Crazy World
for Ents
Crazy World of Arthur
Brown will now appear at
the Ents Albert Hall concert
instead of the Young Ras-
cals, since one of the Young
Rascals broke his leg.
It is also believed that
Jimi Hendrix would have
been willing to appear at the
Carnival Concert (he ap-
peared for Carnival two years
ago at the start of his meteor-
ic career) but was never
asked. Hendrix now appears
at the Albert two days before
the Carnival Concert.
Not just a welcome committee
