Geoff Craig surveys the
Careers scene, drawing from
his own experience and
from what others have said
about choosing a career.
C H O O S I N G A C A R E E R
It's just a year since I started looking at the re-
cruitment diary pinned up in Strathclyde
University. There was the lengthy list of firms in
one column and stars in other columns headed by
the degree subject. Each final year student got one
of these lists and I faithfully went through it,
underlining all the firms interested in metallurgists.
My interest was in extraction metallurgy with a
bent to going abroad, but I thought it would be a
good idea to go to quite a few interviews for the
experience. Several interviews were oversubscribed,
but I went to about half-a-dozen. Eventually three
firms offered me second interviews — I said 'no'
to one and came to London to see the other two.
After that I was offered a good job on a three year
contract in Africa.
On consideration, I decided I was not prepared
to disappear into the blue for three years just then
and so I thought I would investigate the possibili-
ties of postgraduate courses. "Royal School of
Mines" came into my head. A good reputation,
and I found a course which suited me very well so
here I am.
the Company's annual report
and read the Chairman's
statement; look at the over-
seas interest; form your own
opinion of the growth pros-
pects of the company's prod-
ucts; look at the stock mar-
ket quotations, especially the
P/E ratio in the Financial
Times."
He was concerned that
our attitude to industry was
right—" The profit motive is
wholesome and stimulating
and is in the national inter-
est. New graduates should
be prepared to move about
a lot at first and if a com-
pany wants you to move, this
should be considered an en-
couraging signal".
A good degree in science
or technology " is a fine
start to a job in industry ",
but the qualities required for
many of the senior jobs are
" personality, clear thinking,
common sense and the ability
to plan and negotiate."
Once again it is career-
choosing time. Many factors
go into the decision, I sup-
pose the main ones are sal-
ary, job satisfaction and fut-
ure prospects not necessarily
in that order. Unless you
have a distinct sense of voca-
tion it's a difficult decision.
I've been looking through
old careers supplements to
see what advice people have
given in past years.
" What next ? " wrote two
students in 1965. "The deci-
sion is probably the most
important in life."
The next year Lord Jack-
son stressed that " There is
a finality about the choice of
career on graduation only for
the graduate who lacks the
ability to create opportuni-
ties, or at least to take ad-
vantage of the opportunities
provided for him by someone
else ". He felt that graduates
should have a period of
broad training in industry
rather than go straight into
a precisely defined job.
Look around
Last year the Rector wrote
on " Opportunities in Indus-
try ". His first point was that
prospective graduates should
find out about different firms.
" Ask your Professors; ask
your friends already in in-
dustry; ask for and look at
Lord Penney went on to
review the prospects of tech-
nologists aiming for the
board room. In the past
" technologists as a group
have been too narrow in
their outlook", but many
large firms are " desperately
anxious to find and help the
y o u n g technologist who
promises to be good enough
to win a place on their
board". His parting advice
was : " Now is the time to
get in on the ground floor ! "
I have summarised these
articles because it is worth
getting as many people's
ideas as possible, and especi-
ally ideas from men who
have had technological train-
ing and experience.
Careers
publications
There are three Careers
publications which appear to
be widely available through
out the College. The largest is
the " Cornmarket Directory
of Opportunities for Gradu-
ates " with a preface by Har-
old Wilson. This has long
general articles covering a
great variety of careers and
degrees and comprehensive
indexes of organisations seek-
ing graduates. The second is
" Professional Careers for
graduate Scientists and En-
gineers " which includes com-
ments by Chairmen and/or
Managing Directors of well-
known companies on subjects
relevant to new graduates.
Again it has general articles
and indexes, and also five
short case histories. " Career
Choice". published by Per-
gamon-Careers, is the third
book, and this covers 100
firms. It is helpful to spend
time going through these
books as there are many
firms listed which may suit
you better than the common-
ly known larger organisa-
tions.
For postgraduate courses
you can consult the Corn-
market Directory for courses
in Britain.*
Voluntary
service
I would like to end with
a word on voluntary service
abroad.
Graduates in any disci-
pline are welcome and the
period of service is usually
fifteen months to two years.
I spent a year in voluntary
work in East Africa and
really appreciated the time
there. It put Britain into
perspective and also gave me
a greater sense of the tremen-
dous needs of the world.
More information can be ob-
tained from the British Vol-
unteer Programme, 26 Bed-
ford Square, London, W.C.I.
Applications f o r service
should be in as early as pos-
sible and preferably not later
than March 1969 for this
year.
You will find some more
information in this supple-
ment, but it is no substitute
for making the most of the
advisory services and publi-
cations available in the Col-
lege. Spending enough time
now considering all the possi-
bilities will pay dividends
later.
*In addition the Lyon
Playfair Library has a
large selection of University
Calendars and general refer-
ence books.

We offer
Engineering and Science
Graduates everything
...but limited scope!
A t the Central Electricity Generating Board we
know exactly what young graduates are looking
for. A worthwhile salary. Real prospects for a d -
vancement. A n d the sort of challenging openings
that could lead in a dozen different directions.
D u l l , grinding, restricting jobs just aren't around
at the C E G B today, nor are the men you'd find
employed in them! What we're after now are top-
calibre graduates and post-graduates in Physics,
Mathematics, Chemistry and Materials Science
as well as Engineers. T o such people the C E G B
offers tremendous scope: from operational and
management work in generation, transmission
and construction to pure and applied
research.
Mechanical & electrical engineers
o n appointment join our graduate and
training scheme. In a short time—
depending entirely on ability you
could find yourself working on
advanced gas cooled reactors, the 400 k V . trans-
mission supergrid or 660 megawatt super critical
generating units. A l l the time you're gaining
practical experience.
Research plays a vital part in our operations
and likewise the opportunities are plentiful. T r y
flexing your mental muscles on aerodynamics and
fluid flow problems; plasma physics 5 combustion;
H V D . C . and A . C . transmission; stress and v i -
bration analysis; heat transfer and reactor physics.
T h e choice is wide, for both Engineers and
Scientists, so are the opportunities the C E G B
offers. Remember, ours is a young industry with a
national reputation for dynamic
growth. A s k your Appointments
