Do we really need
more scientists?
The short answer is yes.
We need more and better
scientists, we need more en-
couragement of science in
schools, higher quality sci-
ence teachers, more contact
between industry and science
and more applied scientists.
The Government has been
saying this for years and it
hardly bears repeating.
The real need now is to
put all the generalisations
and slogans on one side—for-
get about them—and exam-
ine the situation in detail
Under the microscope it is
very complex and the gener-
alisations often turn out to
be untrue in the particular.
For instance, if you think
that because you are a scien-
tist you must be in high
demand you may be sorely
disappointed.
These questions were put
to three people who are in
the position to know the
vacalities of the situation.
One of them was Dr. Brian
Launder, a lecturer in Chem
Eng, who said :
' Imperial has suffered to
some extent from the fall in
candidates for science and
applied science. The social
sciences are making inroads.
Applications still outnumber
places by four to one, but the
degree of excellence in A-
level is not as high as it was.
' Nationally t h i n g s are
much worse. Colleges of
Technology are having diffi-
culty in filling their places
and are filling them up from
overseas. Government policy
has been to create more
places for technology, but the
fundamental cause is that
engineers do not have the
same status appeal as doc-
tors, scientists, sociologists.
' Every year the caravan
rolls into town and the engin-
eering firms dangle very
tempting offers in front of
our students. We cannot keep
many for research and even
now we have unfilled places
for postgraduates. Elsewhere
MSc courses are running
with three or four students—
a tragic waste of resources.
' American industry knows
how to use graduates so
much better than British in-
dustry, it is almost enshrined
in the American concept of
what is right that education
is good. You almost have to
study to be a secretary.
' Industry itself is not par-
ticularly convinced of the
need to take in advanced
graduates. We do need more
scientists but firms don't al-
ways know it. They do not
always know how to use
them and there has been little
dialogue between universi-
ties and industry.
' We should, with our ad-
vanced techniques and our
real advantage of cheap lab-
our, be more than a match
for America. But the fact that
America stays competitive
with its much higher costs
shows how much more effec-
tively they use their labour.
This is especially true of the
way they use scientists.
' To get industry moving,
one would need a revolution-
ary improvement in the rela-
tions between universities and
industry. There has been no
revolution yet, but there are
signs for the better. Certain-
ly a fairly rapid evolution is
taking place.'
From the NUS publica-
tion ' Choosing a Career'.
JOBS FOR
GRADUATES• • •
... we could blushingly murmur about "interest-
ing opportunities" or "attractive openings", or
try to kid you that you would still really be a
student by talking about "management trainees"
or "graduate apprentices"—but we feel we ought
to be blunt. What we can offer is WORK!
Often interesting, admittedly; quite well-paid,
certainly; intellectually demanding, usually;
damned frustrating, sometimes; but essentially,
basically and fundamentally—work.
This has not put off the graduates we have
wanted in the past—indeed they seem to thrive
remarkably—so possibly you might like to have a
look at us and see whether our curious philo-
sophy appeals or appals.
We are a sizeable outfit, and we take on well over
100 new graduates each year—mainly engineers
and scientists, but including a few Arts people as
well. We cover the field of telecommunications
and electronics pretty well from soup to nuts—
and on an international basis. We will be visiting
your university on February 18, 19, 20, so if you
would like to see us, arrange a meeting through
your Appointments Board.
Our booklet "Information for Graduates" is avail-
able from University Appointments Boards, or
directly from:—
The Personnel Department (Graduates),
STC House,
190 Strand, London, W.C.2.
It gives quite a lot of detail -
scales —and it's free!

What will
I
get paid?
A degree is not an automatic
passport to financial success. All
too often graduates are lured into
jobs by promises of a rosy future.
These figures appeared in an NUS
publication earlier this year. You
can judge your prospects from
them.
