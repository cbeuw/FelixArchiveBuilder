The pathetic I.C. Union
meeting of two weeks ago
must give added point to the
constitutional reform sub-
committee's work, one feature
of which is to come to a
decision about the quorum
number for a Union meeting.
Troubled by inquorate at-
tendances at Union Meetings
(the present quorum is 300
and has rarely been reached
in recent years), it seems
some members of I.C.U. Exec
decided a "joke motion"
would draw the missing
members. Accordingly Pam
Horrocks, this year's vibrant
ICWA President, was ap-
proached to move a motion
to admit women to the Union
bar. Unfortunately, Pam did
not feel adequate to the task,
and she prevailed on Adolf
Hashteroudian, fiery Vice
President of R.C.S.
The plan misfired badly;
there were never 300 mem-
bers present, and the first
challenge to the quorum was
T H E Y T E L L M E
successful. Right wingers de-
layed their challenge until
after the Union Bar motion
had been defeated. However
the real failure lay in the fact
that about 150 people had
been attracted with no inter-
est, a hard core of whom
were determined to reduce
the meeting to disorder. I al-
ways thought A m e r i c a n
comedy had the world's worst
sense of humour in that they
laugh at the same joke every
week, nevertheless certain
members of the I.C. Bar
crowd felt able to laugh at an
obscene interpretation of a
remark by Mr. Olley five
times in as many minutes.
Paper a e r o p l a n e s were
thrown from the floor at the
platform, and by Barry Sulli-
van at the floor, the Mines
President being fortified, with
Miss Horrocks, by his usual
procession of pints from the
Bar.
Mr. Andrews and Mr.
Hood spoke against the
motion to the delight of their
supporters. Mr. Hood, who
recently threatened this col-
umnist that if he ever mis-
represented C o u n c i l or
JURGO he would "person-
ally beat your b head in",
will not be surprised if Union
Secretary Jane Pearson cen-
sors parts of his speech before
she minutes it.
There used to be a trad-
ition that constituent college
Unions dealt with the serious
business. It is unlikely this
Union meeting will have in-
spired 300 to come to the
next one. To do this one must
make Union members feel
they are participating in mak-
ing the real decisions. This
feeling can only be built up
by a series of successful, use-
ful U.G.M.s. This is why the
proposal before the constitu-
tional reform sum-committee
that there be two Union
BEER AT 2d A PINT
The manufacture of beer,
a fermented infusion of mal-
ted barley, is very ancient. In
ancient Egypt lightly baked
barley was soaked in water
with other additives, such as
dates. After fermentation, the
beer was strained through a
cloth into pots. We in this
country drank cider and
mead until the coming of the
Romans. The Saxons then
learnt much about brewing
from us. Hops were not intro-
duced into this country until
the sixteenth century—before
that the beer was rather sweet
—and an Act of Henry VIII
forbade brewers to use hops
in beer because it was con-
sidered a "wicked weed that
would spoil the taste of the
drink and endanger the
people". The poor climate of
this country has given beer
little competition from wine
and it has become the nation-
al drink. Indeed, before the
introduction of tea and coffee,
beer was the only beverage
drunk by the general public.
Figures for London in 1836
relate that every man, woman
and child annually consumed
76 gallons of beer. People
seemed to mistrust water and
much preferred beer— "kept
disease at bay" they said.
Before the advent of com-
mercial brewing it was usual
for each household to brew
its own beer and since 1963
it has been legal for you to
do just this. It costs only a
few pennies a pint.
You will need one plastic
dustbin with a capacity of
over 5 gallons, a large sauce-
pan or bucket, plastic tubing
for syphoning and some
strong screw-top bottles. A l l
the equipment should be
thoroughly clean and metal
equipment should not be used
after the yeast has been
added.
The type of yeast you will
use depends upon the type of
beer you wish to make, e.g.
a lager yeast for lager. Follow
the maker's instructions im-
plicitly.
Light Ale
3 oz. hops
If lb. brown malt
\\ oz. crushed barley
if lb. brown sugar
5 gals, water
Strong Ale
3 oz. hops
2 lb. brown malt
2 oz. crushed barley
4 lb. brown sugar
5 galls water
Mix the hops, malt and
barley (reserving a handful
of hops) with ten pints of
water. Bring slowly to the
boil and then simmer gently
for 40 minutes. Add the rest
of the hops and simmer for a
further 5 minutes. Strain this
onto the sugar in the bin and
add the rest of the water.
When the temperature is 16
degs.-24degs. C add the yeast
( c a r e f u l l y following the
maker's instructions). Cover
with the lid and leave in a
warm place (an airing cup-
board or kitchen is admir-
able). After 2 or 3 days fer-
mentation will begin, giving a
frothy head, and when all
activity ceases (6-9 days) it
is time to bottle. Syphon the
brew into thoroughly clean
bottles to within two inches
of the top. Add \ level tea-
spoon of sugar to each quart
bottle. This will cause a slight
secondary fermentation to
put a good head on your
beer. Screw down the bottles
and keep in a warm place for
three days, then transfer to
a cool place (13 degs.) to
mature. It will be ready in
ten days, but even better if
left for 2 to 3 weeks.
The finished brew will be
about 5 % alcohol by volume.
Pub beer is about 3|%.
Enough said!

meetings every year which
will not need a quorum is so
promising and vital to the
future health of I.C.U. In-
stead these dates will be pub-
lished at the start of the year
and the occasions, one in the
autumn term and one in the
spring term, would be free of
general studies and possibly
first lecture in the afternoon.
In any case, strict rules about
the time to end die meeting
and necessary pre-publicity
should ensure all the quorum
rule is supposed to—after all,
not turning up is a kind of
voting.
Discipline
A recent discipline case at
Council highlights the need
for looking again at our col-
lege disciplinary procedures.
A Mr. Worthington was
found guilty of indiscipline in
I.C. Union. It was alleged he
punched a hop doorman,
smashed glasses against a
wall, and on another occasion
interfered with the cloakroom
by Les Ebdon
attendants and made himself
a nuisance at hops last term.
For the offences of which he
was found guilty he was sen-
tenced by Council to be bar-
red from Union facilities, ex-
cept the refectories, for the
rest of the term, and this will
be extended to the end of the
session if he breaks the ban.
The whole level of Council
punishments is ridiculous, if
we are to maintain control
over our Union the yobos
who jeered Council members
after this decision must act
responsibly. I.C.U. Council
has a duty to protect mem-
bers it asks to do the thank-
less task of ticket scrutinis-
ing and d u t y officering.
Nobody will give up an even-
ing to do this unpopular task
if he is not protected from
personal, physical violence.
Nor will we ever lower our
losses to vandalism in the
bar unless we take a strong
line there, too.
What excuse can there be
for the minimum sentence for
wanton destruction of Union
property being less than ban-
ning from the union for less
than a year, and any pub
which has a barman assaul-
ted will never allow the hooli-
gan back again? Nothing less
than a life ban is suitable if
d u t y officers have been
attacked.
Perhaps Council's senten-
ces would become more
realistic if trial procedures
were more formal. Council
should separate the inquisi-
torial process (the facts
should be ascertained from
the witnesses allowing full
publicity and legal rights to
the accused), the judgement
(this must be made in secret
and be overwhelming) and the
sentences (for which guide-
lines must be set). Or are
Council too scared of the bar
bullies to act?
Q jumping
People who rightfully com-
plain at the irritating and
anti-social rise in queue-
jumping at Mooney Southside
are probably wasting their
time, until the Southside Re-
fectory Complaints Officer
first rids himself of the dep-
lorable habit.
