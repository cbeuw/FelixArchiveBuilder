I did not attend the NUS demonstration
on Wednesday because I do not
agree with its motive or with the
scaremongering the NUS has done in the
build up to the protest. There is a huge
problem in this country, which is not
only the deficit, but the warped situation
whereby taxpayers who do not go to
University pay for those that do. Students
need to take more responsibility for their
choice in going to University and realise
that if we are the benefit to society that
we want to be, we should take an active
approach to helping to bring the deficit
down.
The NUS has been saying that the
current measures will price people out
of University; this is untrue and does
considerable damage. Yes we have to
do more to widen participation in Higher
Education amongst the poorest, but in the

proposed system, regardless of the debt
you incur, you do not have to pay for it up
front and only do pay for it when you are
earning £21,000. It is also written off after
30 years. Under this proposed system,
the rich graduates will pay more back
because they can afford it; what part of
that is unfair? I believe that demonstration
is important and that marching in the
streets, regardless of how it will affect the
Government’s decision, is a worthwhile
way to show what you believe in. But
some people have gone too far.
King’s video against the Government’s
plan would make you think that all
Universities are being shut down and
all students are going to be attacked by
zombies; whilst Goldsmiths’ stunt of
hanging effigies of David Cameron and
Nick Clegg is just hideous – whoever had
that idea and went through with it has
just lessened the value of a degree as
something that is meant to go alongside
intellectual thought. From some of the
language used you’d think we were
fighting the rise of a fascist police
state or a new apartheid, not a simple
readjustment so that we bear some of
the responsibility of our choice to go to
University.
If our Students’ Unions put the same
effort as they did in bussing students
to London for this demo into going into
local schools and teaching pupils that
University is accessible, we would have

a much better
country, and a much
better National
Union of Students.
Finally a word
on the violence
seen after the
demonstration; I
realise this was
not the NUS’ plan,
and I join them in condemning it, but in
the end, if you call an event ‘Demolition’
you have to expect something like that to
happen.
