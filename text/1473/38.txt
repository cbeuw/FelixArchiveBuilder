Scorpio
This week you go to the library cafe
but there aren’t any baked potatoes
available. They won’t be ready for 15
minutes. GOOD GOD. You perform
seppuku right there in front of the
counter. You die a respectful death.
The potatoes are ready in 2 minutes...

Horoscopes
Aries
This week you sit at your desk, watch-
ing your contributors working conscien-
tiously on the paper. Given that one in
seven people are reptilian shape-shifters
you quickly become suspicious. It’s him
over there isn’t it? You attack with a rub-
ber banana. SMACK SPLAFF DIE!
Taurus
This week you totally go sailing. You
feel part of some glorious upper-class.
You go home and rub supreme upper-
class spunk in your girlfriend’s face.
She’s unresponsive. She’s been that way
since the car-accident 6 months ago.
You weep... and then get horny.
Gemini
This week you move to a new house
underneath the sea. It predictably springs
a leak and you drown. Drowning is
horrific. It’s like watching your best
friend fuck your sister, his surprisingly
large cock stretching her apart. The
feeling of inadequacy is painful...
Cancer
This week you fuck all of the people
you shouldn’t fuck. Your best mate’s ex,
your other mate’s ex, your other mate’s
sister, your other mate’s mom, your
other mate’s tub of “I Can’t Believe
it’s Not Inedible Butter Now, I Mean I
Totally Stuck My Penis in it...”
Leo
“If you’re looking for me, you’d better
check under the sea, coz that is where
you’ll find me. Underneath the sealaaab,
underneath the waterrr. Seaalabbb at
the bottom of the seaaa.” I love ‘Sealab
2021’. I love it so much I’m going to pay
to watch it... Nahhh only joking LOL!
Virgo
This week you really need to pee. You
decide to hold it in... for agesss. Soon you
start getting ‘300’ flashbacks. “HOLD
MEN. HOOOOOLD. HOOOOOLD!!!”
and then your bladder explodes. Literally
a piss-bomb just went off inside your
own body. That’s how pathetic you are.
Libra
This week you have about twelve con-
versations with people who you consid-
er to be twats. You devise a plan to make
certain that these people know that you
hate them. Every time they start speak-
ing you fart and drawl sarcasticaly, “fi-
nally some decent conversation”
Sagittarius
This week you get naked and rub your
bare asshole against a girl’s leg (See
left). Later you screw her. You realise
that being classy is never going to get
you laid and write a pick-up book called
“Using your ass to get laid”. You make
millions. There are no downsides.
Capricorn
This week you go kick-boxing. You
realise that the teacher is a sadistic
bastard. He calls you to the front of the
class. Waves his foot around in the air,
an impressive show of agility, strength
and balance. And then lunges forward,
and nipple-cripples you! DAMNNN!
Aquarius
This week you have discreetly revealed
the true identities of Hangman and
Angry Geek on Pages 12, 24 and 39.
Go on have a look. It’s there. Hiding
in plain sight. Only a UCL student
couldn’t find it. (LOL, WHAHEY
BANTER!!! fuck-off...)
Pisces
This week you grow a moustache for
Movember. You sit for hours, straining
your face, pushing out the hairs,
willing it to grow with every fibre of
your being. You look in the mirror.
Success! A fully-formed handlebar has
appeared! You’re a girl... FAIL

Farm’ after rebel attacks”
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
“TITTIES! SUCK MY MAN TITTIES!!!” Well that’s what I imagine he’s screaming...
