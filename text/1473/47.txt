On their next drive the offence
marched 58 yards down the field to
score. Tino Millar rushed 30 yards to the
end zone only for the play to be called
back for a holding penalty. However a

the mound for the Falcons saw us take
a two run lead heading into the last in-
ning. The Thieves mounted a late come-
back though, scoring one run and nearly
stealing the game away before catcher
Gary Lam got the last out of the game
on a brilliant play at home plate for a
2-1 win.
Next, we faced the Southampton
Mustangs, and this immediately took
on a different flavour to the low scoring
first game. Despite Hajime Urata’s fine
pitching, errors on both sides coupled
with some big hits saw Imperial trailing
5-3 heading into the last inning. Usually
dependable baserunners were caught
stealing on back to back plays, putting
Imperial in a two out hole, but the team
went on to score two runs to force a 5-5
tie.
Our third game was the local derby
against the Kings Lions, whom we have
beaten twice already early on in the
2010 season. Behind ace pitcher Han-
son Cheung, Imperial took a 8-1 lead.
With that, the Falcons were tied for the
Last weekend, the Imperial College
Baseball Club played in its biggest tour-
nament of the year, the British Univer-
sity Baseball Association (BUBA) Fall
Cup, featuring the top six university
baseball teams battling for the right to
be called the best in the country. This
was Imperial’s first Fall Cup, having
earned an automatic spot by winning
the Southern League last year. The Fal-
cons travelled to Herts Hertfordshire
team grounds in Hemel Hempstead on
Saturday the 30th of October. We were
prepared for a long day of baseball,
with the bulk of the round robin stage
taking place on Saturday. The top two
teams would face off in the Sunday af-
ternoon Fall Cup final, while the 3rd and
4th place teams would battle for the Fall
Shield.
Fielding an 18 man roster, our first
game was a matchup against the Not-
tingham Thieves, one of three teams
to defeat Imperial last season. A bril-

The BUAFL season got off to a fly-
ing start this Sunday as the Imperial
Immortals narrowly lost a nail-biting
thriller on an overtime field goal to
their Thames Valley Conference rivals,
the Surrey Stingers. The two teams last
met in March when Surrey managed an
18-8 win and the Immortals were out to
avenge last season’s loss.
On a cold day at their home ground in
Harlington and supported by their vocif-
erous new cheerleading squad, the Im-
mortals went behind early as the Sting-
ers scored on a passing play. This early
setback seemed to galvanise the team
and both offence and defence buckled
down to make plays which paid divi- ... Continued on page 45
