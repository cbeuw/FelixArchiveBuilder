rt raising serious money

The Yale University Invest-
ments office is responsible
for managing its multi-billion
dollar endowment. It is recon-
gised world over as the bas-
tion by which all other univer-
sities with large endowments
should be guided. Up until
the financial crisis, Yale was
achieving yearly double digit
returns on its investments for
decades.
David Swensen, the Univer-
sity’s Chief Investment Offi-
cer is considered by many as
something of an investment
guru and one of the world’s
pioneers in applications of the
Nobel Prize winning Modern
Portfolio Theory. He has also
penned an extremely well re-
ceived book on institutional
investment management and
is an advisor to Obama’s ad-
ministration and its Economic
Recovery Advisory board.
Several prominent endow-
ment managers have passed
through the Yale Investment
Office. Alumni of the office
include Jane Mendillo of Har-
vard, Seth Alexander of MIT
and Andrew Golden of Princ-
eton, among many others. Sw-
ensen and his office have also
acted as advisors for many
other endowment managers,
including the University of
Cambridge.
Yale does not achieve its ex-
traordinary returns by simply
following conventional market
wisdom. Instead, Swensen is
a master when it comes to
shying away from financial
products and asset classes
that are characterised by high
levels of liquidity and tradi-
tional lower returns like com-
modities and bonds of both
the corporate and government
variety.
In his search for alpha,
that is, supernormal market
returns, Swensen is instead
heavily focused on alternative
investments like Hedge Funds
and Private Equity Funds as
well as less traditional equi-
ties.
Due to its wild success,
the Yale Model has come to
be known as the stanfard
“Endowment Model”. Unfor-
tunately, however, this kind
of strategy is not at every in-
vestment manager’s disposal
given the high assets under
management necessary for
its implementation.
their income comes from public bodies.
In the United States, most of the top
institutions are completely private and
independent institutions that have zero
need for the federal government, and are
therefore exclusively reliant on their en-
dowments and by default, their alumni.
The Adam Smith Institute has advocated
that universities should move towards
an endowment-based model, presum-
ably in order to downplay the financial
sensitivity of institutions’ income to
government changes.
Regardless of the funding model
each university chooses to adopt, what
genuinely matters is their total income.
A higher total income is a catalyst that
stimulates better research, affords better
facilities, captures more talented staff,
and chiefly, it ensures an institution is
able to offer need-blind financial assis-
tance in the form of merit scholarships
and income-assessed bursaries, guaran-
teeing that anyone who is academically
capable of attending the institution is
able to do so without the fear of insur-
mountable debt.
Imperial College’s total funding, is
about £780 million which includes its
small endowment of £56 million. Bar-
ring University College London, this is
by far the smallest sum of any university
in the World Top 10 as ranked by the
Times Higher Education Supplement.
Were there an award for the world’s
most prosperous university, Harvard
would be the reigning champion with an
endowment worth an estimated £17bn,
while in the UK, Cambridge would take
this prize with total funding totalling
circa £5bn. Imperial’s US equivalent,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy rakes in close to £7bn. This begs the
question of competitivity in the academ-
ic market-place to be raised. With vastly
inferior sums of money, how can Impe-
rial compete in attracting the foremost
academics, and ensuring it is the choice
of the brightest students worldwide?
It is no doubt that universities have
found the urgent need to become more
and more self-sufficient. The University
of Cambridge was the first institution
outside the USA to raise over £1bn from
donations. The drive that was started in
2005 was completed two years ahead
of schedule, partly thanks to donations
from over 45,000 alumni. Not to be out-
done by its archrival, Oxford University
is treading similar waters and recently
launched a bid to raise £1.25bn. In stark
contrast, Imperial has raised £4m in
alumni donations since 2003; equivalent
to just 1.6% of what Cambridge man-
aged to collect. Clearly, Imperial needs
to do something. While a drive on the
scale of Oxbridge could prove to be
somewhat megalomaniac and potential-
ly unachievable, Imperial needs to do
something significant. The University of
Bristol has recently commenced a drive
to raise £100million from its alumni,
something the College could emulate.
While mostly desirable, this self-suffi-
ciency does have its drawbacks. Harvard
and Yale were deeply invested in the fi-
nancial markets and were keen investors
in hedge funds and private equity funds
alike. During the turbulence of financial
markets during the crisis, Harvard and
Yale’s endowments suffered a tremen-
dous blow, losing roughly 30% each for
the 2008/2009 financial year, bringing
them to a still impressive $26bn and
$16bn, respectively. While American
universities with smaller endowments
saw a decrease in their total value, this
was curbed by the fact that, propor-
tionally, they held more cash than their
Harvard and Yale counterparts. Imperial
fared relatively well during this period,
in both comparative and absolute terms
seeing a growth of 11% in total income.
Imperial seems to be keenly aware
of its financial shortcomings. The Col-
lege has admitted in its financial report
that it “has insufficient endowments on
which it can rely to provide the neces-
sary independence from external fund-
ing support”. It has also stated that there
is a risk that it “will not be able to com-
pete in the world’s premier league”, and
that to do so would require an endow-
ment “equivalent to other world-class
universities”. It has also alluded to the
possibility of a change in the makeup of
the student body as it recently vowed
to “keep under review the profile of the
student body in the light of the need for
financial sustainability”.
Imperial must challenge the way in
which it has operated in the past and
shift away from relying on fees to fund
a significant portion of its operating
costs.
Self-awareness seems to be Impe-
rial’s virtue here. If the College steps
up and puts on a stellar funding drive,
its chances of getting to the end of the
race unscathed and maintaining a place
amongst the academic elite will be
greatly increased.
