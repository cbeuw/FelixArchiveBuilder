It was a crisp Saturday morning as a
group of Imperial fencers headed out to
St Paul’s School Sports Hall for the Lon-
don Team Trophy.
The number of entries for the competi-
tion was its highest ever, with 16 epee
teams, 16 foil teams and 12 sabre teams,
making the competition the second big-
gest team event in the country after the
National Championships. Representing
Imperial were three full teams. In foil:
Imperial 1st with Ed Collier, Chris Gil-
liam, Outi Supponen and Robert Shaw.
In epee: Imperial 1st consisting of Ed
Gilhead, Marcello Columbino and Miles
Gandolfi and Imperial 2nd with Thor-
sten Hamann, Charlotte Levin and Peter
Cronbach. In both weapons, we had pre-
vious year’s results to defend, gold for
the foil team and silver for epee.
In the epee, Imperial 1st won all their
matches in the first round without much
trouble, while in the foil Imperial 1st
also kept their level high with the same
result. Imperial 2nd epee lost one out
of three matches and won the rest with
a comforting margin. All teams easily
qualified for the quarterfinal knock-out
rounds.
In the quarterfinal draw for the epee,
Imperial 1st were faced once again with
a young ULU team they had met in the
first round and Imperial 2nd was up
against a team called “+39”, a hint that
the entire team originated from Italy.
Imperial 2nd unfortunately had to ad-
mit themselves defeated by the skilled
Italians. Happily the sad faces did not
last for long as Imperial 1 methodically
made their way to the final, convinc-
ingly beating +39 in the semis. In the
final they faced Brixton, a strong team
of young fencers. The match was even,
swaying back and forth all the way to
the last period where Imperial showed
the value of experience and keeping
their nerves under control to win the
match and clinch gold.
Meanwhile, in another hall, the foil
team was presenting results similar to
the first team epeeists. They cruised their
way to victory in both quarterfinal and
semi-final, but were defeated in the fi-
nal by Salle Paul EU, a very strong team
from one of the country’s top clubs. This
was a small let down compared to last
year, when they had won gold, but they
at least had the honour to have the Presi-
dent of British Fencing, Keith Smith, as
a referee in the last match. When we
left the hall at the end of the day, after
prize ceremony and high-fives, we were
all tired but happy enough to enjoy the
delights of Halloween.
