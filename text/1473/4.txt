Do you think these guys are ridin’ dirty?
50,000 students march
against cuts and higher fees
Union President stays away from protest saying he doesn’t
believe in its motive
50,000 students and lecturers from
across the country marched on Parlia-
ment on Wednesday in protest of gov-
ernment plans to cut funding to uni-
versities and increase tuition fees to
anywhere up to £9,000.
The peaceful protest, which was
marred by violence at Conservative
Headquarters, was acknowledged by
government ministers as “just the begin-
ning” of a cuts backlash.
NUS President Aaron Porter said ,
“this government is abdicating its re-
sponsibility to fund the education and
skills provision we desperately need just
as every other country is investing in its
future. We cannot and will not accept
that miserable vision for our future”.
The government is planning to cut al-
most entirely the teaching grant for Arts
and Humanities courses, while protect-
ing Science, Technology, Engineering
and Medical courses like those taught at
Imperial.
Almost all London universities were
represented at the march, with Imperial
being a notable exception. Union Presi-
dent Alex Kendall told Felix, “I did not
attend the NUS demonstration… be-
cause I do not agree with its motive.”
He added that “Students need to take
more responsibility for their choice in
going to university and realise that if
we are the benefit to society that we
want to be, we should take an active
approach to helping to bring the deficit
down.”
There was violence at the Millbank
Building, home to Conservative HQ,
caused by a minority of protestors.
Around 200 protestors smashed win-
dows and started fires outside the build-
ing. The violence has been condemned
by student leaders including Aaron
Porter and Alex Kendall, as well as the
Prime Minister David Cameron who
said that there would be no turning back
on tuition fees.
Many of the students were marching
against the Lib Dem betrayal of their
election promise to vote against any
increase in tuition fees. The N.U.S. has
promised to turf out any Lib Dem MP
who breaks their pre-election pledge and
Nick Clegg has since expressed his re-
gret in signing the pledge.
The protest has turned up the heat on
the Lib Dems and the coalition in gen-
eral but it remains to be seen whether it
will achieve its aim of preventing a tu-
ition fee rise.

London-Brighton
Veteran Car Run
50,000 students marched
peacefully against higher fees and
university cuts
Government
funding for arts
and humanities
courses is
effectively being
reduced to zero
To compensate, the cap on tuition
fees is being raised, but not
abolished as Browne recommended
Old cap:
£3,290
New cap:
£6,000
Special higher cap
for unis that actively
encourage poor stu-
dents: £9,000
In the new system, the richest 60%
will pay more than currently but the
poorest 25%
will pay less,
according to the
government

S
ir Keith O’Nions joined the
City and Guilds Constitu-
ent Union (CGCU) on the
annual London to Brighton Vet-
eran Car Run. They journeyed on
‘Bo’’, the official transport of the
CGCU President, a 1902 James
& Browne car which is one of only
two left in the world. The name
‘Bo’ is a biblical reference to Bo-
anerges, the sons of thunder.
The London to Brighton Veteran
Car Run is a celebration of the re-
laxation of motoring restrictions
in 1896. Prior to that, the law re-
quired an escort with a red flag to
walk 50m in front of any car.
