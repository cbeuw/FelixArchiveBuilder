COMMENT
Steroids would improve sport
W
hen I was 10 years
old I started play-
ing Rugby. I was
an imposing 4ft 8”
(though even that
might be generous). With a career as the
next England captain in front of me, I
returned to pre season training with the
under 11 squad for an introduction to
full contact. So began 6 years of big kids
kicking the shit out of me.
I doubt I am alone in this. You may
even be one of these ‘big kids’ yourself.
Even then, I’m willing to bet there’s
always been someone bigger. You see,
‘big kids’ are the real problem that is
rampant in our sport today, simple ge-
netics are what we should be taking
urine samples for. Steven Gerrard was
told in the Liverpool youth academy it
was fine him being able to crack it at 50
mph as a teenager, if he didn’t hit 6ft he
was out.
So where does that leave us? A sport-
ing world dominated by the best bred,
is this something we should be stand-
ing for? Bringing in the change is easy,
especially when we have the answer al-
ready on the table.
Black Sheep
Steroids and performance enhancing
drugs are already endemic in some of
the worlds biggest sports. The elephants
in the room (almost literally) are the
body builders, but flying in at 70mph
on 2 wheels just behind them are the cy-
clists. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a design-
er drug of today which is untraceable in
the system after 6 hours and makes you
go like Usain Bolt. To be a professional
cyclist and abstaining from taking this
isn’t noble, or ‘in the spirit of competi-
tion’, it’s mental. Everybody’s doing it.
Still, with every key stroke I hear the
nay sayers and the yet to be converted.
“What about practising every day to get
good” “Shouldn’t take shortcuts” “It’s
cheating”. Allow me to now explain
why I chose these complaints in particu-
lar as I succinctly answer them. I’ll start
at the end, it’s only cheating whilst the
rules make it cheating, if you change the
rules it isn’t cheating, the entire game of
Rugby I spent 6 years learning to detest
was only invented because some pub-
lic school boy was crap at football and
cheated, cheating can be good (that’s a
bad example of that though...).
As for saying you shouldn’t take short
cuts, that you should just work hard, you
still can. Truly, I have never grasped
that argument as being anything less
than a fundamental lack of understand-
ing about how Steroids work. You don’t
spend 2 days just taking them, get class
in an afternoon and sleep till Sunday.
Even if you were 6’ 6” and built like
a brick shit house you think you could
play the between-the-legs shot Roger
Federer busts out? I didn’t think so.
I think that’s the point I’ve spent a
long winded 400 or so words trying to
make so far, steroids are a great leveler.
They let you train harder and help make
you a better player. Better players make
for better sport. I accept they are a prob-
lem whilst they remain illegal in sport.
The honest and rule abiding (who I am
actually for) are punished by those who
break the rules, but what better way to
deal with a problem that has no realis-
tic end insight than to stop making it a
problem?
Anyway, that’s my dream and my
piece on it. I’m off to go put 200lbs on
and yell at some people from speaker’s
corner in Hyde Park about it. A very
muscular hand shake goodbye.
I
collapsed this week, caved in and
put Fairytale Of New York by
The Pogues on my iPod. It’s like
funding an insurgency campaign
in my mp3 player; it’s not offen-
sively Christmassy, but it’s beginning to
make the other albums on there consider
rising up in protest and installing a fes-
tive dictatorship.
I think it’s properly Christmas now,
so I’m tentatively preparing myself for
six solid weeks of red and green being
the only colours in existence, an en-
tire month of balls-out, wang-flailing
cheeriness that won’t abate for a second
until the crushing reality of January 1st
descends on us.
I hunch myself in the corner of Star-
bucks at the moment, fighting some
sort of cultural Battle of the Bulge. Up
goes the laptop. I arrange the leftover
(Christmas red) paper cups in a make-
shift barricade. Hunker down for the
Hun’s next push, an artillery barrage of
eggnog-flavoured syrup or something.
I’m safe in the Ardennes. Can’t get me
in the Ardennes.
The line that gets trotted out every
year, that we put the decorations up too
early and it’s too commercial, is begin-
ning to feel slightly older than the tradi-
tion itself. As is the fact-shitting about
pagan festivals and Roman cultural
Angry Geek
domination. Don’t get me wrong when
I construct an elaborate 70% post-con-
sumer recycled foxhole in the nearest
coffee shop, I’m not one of the people
who drones on about Christmas like it’s
a sexually transmitted disease. I am all
up on Christmas. I love this shit. I lis-
ten to Frank Sinatra belt out the same
three songs over and over again until my
internal organs start to think seriously
about impeaching my own brain.
It’s just I like to ease myself into it.
Like a hot bath. I like to dip a toe in here
or there, gasp a little, giggle to myself
and then slowly inch myself in. That’s
the analogy here. What’s actually hap-
pening is that one day in early Novem-
ber I wake up and someone chucks a full
kettle of boiling water over my face. Not
the same thing. Not the same thing at all.
As a result, I’m rationing Christmas
cheer so that there’s enough to last me
through the next two months, with may-
be a little left at the end to prop me up
when the inevitable crushing disappoint-
ment of 2011 begins to dawn on me. The
rules are as follows: Saturday and Sun-
day, Christmas all day. Mondays, Christ-
mas from midnight to lunchtime. Then,
strictly no aural references to Christmas
until Wednesday noon. Full-on Christ-
mas then restarts on Friday at 4pm, at
which point I blend together a mince
pie, a candy cane, four carrots and some
whisky and down the lot.
This is the way you do it. The staff in
Argos look ready to slit their own throats
by the start of December, because they
don’t follow the strict A Geek Regime.
What they need is a little Thunderbirds-
like red button that, when pressed, flips
over hidden panels in the wall to reveal
flashing lights and tinsel-decorated
trees with little reindeers perched on
top, preferably live ones. Then it gives
it a bit of purpose, a bit of pizzazz, to
stop it from just becoming background
noise. Then one day, just to mix things
up, you replace the Christmas decora-
tions with beach furniture. Boom. Minds
blown. Stay on your toes, consumers,
because who knows what month it’s go-
ing to be tomorrow. HAPPY CHINESE
NEW YEAR. MERRY SUMMER
SOLSTICE.
I await Imperial to implement a simi-
lar joy-rationing scheme. Until they do,
I will be following in the footsteps of
Belle and Sebastian, and staging a gue-
rilla resistance against The Pogues and
any other form of Christmas joy. So if
you pass Sherfield and find yourself in
the middle of a hastily-organised Easter
celebration, don’t worry. I’m doing it for
your own good. Merry Christmas. God
bless us, every one.

A selection of the
reactions to last
week’s Black Sheep
felixonline.co.uk
The subject was...
Drugs should be legalised.
“The ‘just say no’ mentality is
a bit dated - an ecstasy tablet
won’t kill you, and I swear the
media hype about mephed-
rone turned out to be a hoax
(i.e. mephedrone wasn’t the
cause of death).
If the government was really
concerned about safety they’d
legalise drugs and make them
state run. Similar to abortions,
for example: before you had
women being severely injured
and killed by back-alley jobs,
but it didn’t put anyone off,
whereas now they can go to a
hospital and have it done safe-
ly (forget the cries of religious
quacks).”
Anonymous
“Simon Jenkins recently said:
“I sometimes realise that, if
Britain still had the death pen-
alty, no current political leader
would have the guts to abolish
it.””
James Fletcher
“The reason soft drug related
deaths (mdma, ketamine, can-
nabis) are so low is because
theyre illicit hence a ‘drugs
community’ forms which looks
after each other and passes
on advice on dosage etc. If
mdma were legal we would wit-
ness a surge of deaths due to
newbies overdosing because
there was no one experienced
to look after them. Decriminali-
sation of possession is prefer-
able but the current system
works anyway: those who want
to get high can obtain drugs
easily and after all, only the
idiots get caught.”
