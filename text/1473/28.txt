FILM
Remember when you were little and you made imaginary films of all your toys? This is it
Friday 12 November 2010
Having just watched A Town Called
Panic, I am employing every ounce of
self-control and the limited reserve of
dignity in my body and mind to prevent
myself from writing this review in full
caps-lock. Words alone cannot describe
how much I enjoyed this film. Guttural
noises would hardly do it justice either.
If you only take one thing from this re-
view, if not even this whole newspaper
this year, it is that you should see this
film.
The easiest way to describe it would
be quirky, however “quirky” is a term
bandied about a lot, and never in a good
way. Quirky is like Cute’s ugly cousin.
If someone has a quirky fashion sense,
for example, it means they know that
individualism is the key, but take it too
far. I mean we all go to Topshop and
see that one item of clothing and think
“ah man that’s an awesome shoulder
padded leopard print blazer with an ap-
pliqué pattern of Pol-pot’s face on the
lapel” try it on and think, “ah man this
is hilarious but no, I’m not in a La Roux
video” and then put it back. The next
day however we, the quirk-deficient
masses, will be walking into college
and see said quirky person walking it,
not only in the blazer but with a pair
of knee high maroon Doc martens and
some skinnies they found in a skip in
Dalston. Quirky, in other words is: Shit,
but endearingly earnest.
A Town Called Panic on the other hand
is not like that. It is certainly not shit – it
is incredible – and although endearing
to beyond levels never seen before in a
film, it does so with the cool understated
lack of earnestness that exemplifies its
breathtaking sense of simple, unadulter-
ated fun. That said, its quirkiness stems
from taking concepts, in this case os-
tensibly for family entertainment, and
elevating them to new heights. Basic
characters, easy to understand scenarios,
comedy violence and bright colourful
visuals are all here in joyously over-
blown proportions.
Originating from a Belgian kids TV
series launched in 2000 with the same
name, A Town Called Panic invented the
creative themes that are instantly recog-
nisable to British television viewers as
the Cravendale Milk adverts, produced
by the same guys. Although this is so
much more than just “Cravendale-Le
Movie,” all the most arresting themes
are here: the plastic toys; painstaking
and impressive stop motion anima-
tion; dialogue at nothing less than a full
throated shout (though being in French
adds a softer and certainly more come-
dic effect) and, although the successive
scenarios are so non-sequitur as to make
Monty Python look like Jane Austen, the
narrative has a fluidity that never lets the
pace falter. It would be customary now
to attempt to give a brief introduction
to the plot, but when the plot involves
a Horse as a sort of father figure to a
cowboy and indian, in love with a piano
teacher and living in a village with an
alcoholic farmer called Steven with a
story line revolving around what hap-
pens when cowboy and indian try to
organise a surprise for horse, it quickly
becomes pointless trying. Anyway I was
laughing too hard throughout most of it
to remember.
Coming in at under 90 minutes, this
pint sized puppet film had me roaring
with laughter and cheering it on. Re-
markably for an animated children’s
film it had a slot in the Official Selec-
tion at Cannes Film festival. It is out on
DVD on Monday the 15th of November
and comes with my whole hearted rec-
ommendation. A joy.

What can be so interesting about an old
but loving married couple who could not
be happier with their lives? According to
Mike Leigh, the director of one of this
year’s best films, quite a lot. In a film that
is separated over one year, it’s the people
around them that present all the complex
emotional problems with the four sea-
sons bringing about four unique episodes
of supporting characters with their own
struggles. For Tom (Jim Broadbent) and
Gerri (Ruth Sheen), the blissfully mar-
ried couple, the coming year is just “An-
other Year,” but a year can bring out so
much pain in others, pain that they have
to acknowledge and deal with.
Fulfilling jobs, soothing hobbies, sta-
ble home, healthy conversations, great
meals are what make up Tom and Gerri’s
successful marriage. But just because
they’re living the picture-perfect life, it
doesn’t mean their friends are. Take Ger-
ri’s colleague Mary (Lesley Manville)
for example; after a string of unsuccess-
ful relationships including failed mar-
riages, she is lonely, and knocking back
glasses of wine - a common occurrence
for her sad existence. She has not given
up hope, and is convinced that men are
still interested in her. She eventually sets
her eyes on Tom and Gerri’s only son Joe
(Oliver Maltman), and is quite naturally
bitter and devastated when he brings
around a young, attractive, perky fiancée
(Karina Fernandez) home one day.
Many of the events seen in Another
Year seem uninteresting; a male/fe-
male friend visiting for dinner, a son
visiting for a few days, a funeral etc…
but Leigh makes sure that every single
event means something significant and
with the film’s central theme of compa-
ny, loneliness, depression and happiness
each seasonal episode is there to bring
about new revelations and new charac-
ters that make a significant impact on
the general flow of the film’s narrative.
No matter how annoying or inappro-
priate their friends may be, Tom and
Gerri tolerate them with all their heart.
Mary goes on and on (always with a
large glass of wine in one of her hands,
of course) about the most insignificant
details of her life. She gets chattier and
makes less sense when drunk, and it’s
obvious she gets sloshed every night on
wine. Her rambling is hysterical at first,
but as she continues, the audience is giv-
en enough time and invasive close-up
shots to realise just how hopeless she is.
Manville gives the best performance in a
film full of outstanding ones. She brings
out enough humour from her character
but every facial expression on her face
reminds us of something more depress-
ing and desperate. She may not be a
likable character, but is someone you
can feel sympathy for. Manville magi-
cally transforms this otherwise hateful
spinster into a victim of chronic loneli-
ness. The film’s final moment is focused
solely on Manville and no one else. With
no music or dialogue, Manville alone is
perfectly able to portray the fear and
worry for the tragedy that awaits her.
Rich with low-key, subtle, hugely ef-
fective comedy as well as some heart-
wrenching drama, Another Year is one
of Leigh’s finest works of his career.
The title and general tone of the film
may be off-putting for some for being
“too British;” and yes, this is as British
as they come, but it’s simply outstanding
because of it.

Basic characters,
comedy violence
and bright colourful
visuals are all here
in joyously overblown
proportions
selections of eerie dark shades, with a
plot to match. Based loosely on Philip
K. Dick’s fantastic Do androids dream
of electric sheep, it gives more questions
than answers while remaining captivat-
ing and enjoyable. A must watch for
anyone with a modem. Check it out on
