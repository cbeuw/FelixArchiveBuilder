Imperial overcame stiff competition this Sat-
urday from Essex, Kingston and East London
Universities to reach the second leg of the
indoor tournament. The six IC players were
amongst the most experienced in the Cricket
club and put up a spirited performance that en-
sured victories in all three of their matches.
The IC team turned up so fashionably late
we almost missed the first game played against
Essex University and vice-captain Viran Par-
mar had to skip his mandatory Burger King
stop. After winning the toss the Jack Black
(or Shneebly as called by the tournament or-
ganiser) look-a-like Essex Captain put IC in
to bat. This immediately turned out to be a big
mistake as James Musgrave scored a quick fire
27 before retiring. Former skipper Ankit Patel
scored a further 26 before retiring and Ahsaan
Ismail chipped in with a further 18. James and
Ankit returned to wreak further havoc, stretch-
ing the score to a whopping 133 after 12 overs.
The high quality pace attack provided by Viran
Parmar, Navin Surtani, Ankit Patel and Ahsaan
Ismail restricted Essex 101 all out. Viran and
Navin provided extremely tight opening spells
with Ahsaan and Ankit ensuring that Essex
Cricketers rock
indoor tournament
like a hurricane
were shut completely out of the game.
After a quick Subway lunch – with Musgrave
loving his first ever footlong and Ankit spilling
half of his – and a long discussion about Eng-
land’s Ashes chances captain Matt Tarr won the
toss and elected to bat once again in the second
match against Kingston. All 6 of the batsmen
contributed to IC’s total with Viran and Ankit
going past 25. Defending 125, IC’s bowlers got
even better during the second match with Viran
Parmar actually bowling a maiden- an extreme
rarity indoors. Kingston finished on 102-5 and
the IC team marched on to the play-offs.
Due to the mismanagement of the tourna-
ment, IC were forced to play their third and
most crucial game against East London, who
incidentally knocked IC out last year, imme-
diately after their second game. The fatigue
began to show as Matt’s decision to bat first
again began slowly. The East London bowlers
bowled very tightly and made good use of the
swinging ball. Fatigue showed and IC got to
a modest 103 all out thanks in large to Viran
with 34. IC bowlers knew they had to bowl and
field out of their skins; and how they did. Viran
and Navin provided another fantastic start to
the innings knocking over 3 of the East Lon-
don batsman in two overs. James then used his
variations to account for another. However, the
runs were not entirely stopped and at just un-
der the half way stage the score stood at 48/3.
Shortly after, Matt introduced Ahsaan and An-
kit into the attack which helped to reduce the
East London run rate. Ultimately it all boiled
down to the last 3 overs of which East London
needed 33 runs. Ankit bowled a fantastic over
knocking over the fifth East London batsman;
and when this was followed by a further tight
over by Ahsaan to put IC on the brink. IC had
achieved victory by 21 runs and the team cel-
ebrated by going to a nearby pub where they
were treated to some unique karaoke by the
Essex locals with Ahsaan chatting up a very
drunk Essex blonde named Denise – the only
failure in an otherwise successful day for the
players.

If you want to look as smart as these chaps you’ll have to join the cricket club
Last weekend, the cycling club somehow
packed three riders and their bikes into a Ford
Fiesta and sent them off to Manchester for the
BUCS track cycling championships. Held at
Manchester Velodrome, the home of the all-
conquering British track cycling team, it was
going to be a great experience, if nothing else.
The team consisted of experienced track cyclist
Toby Sherwood and two newcomers Iain Palm-
er and Iain Gillam. With Sherwood a double
medallist at last year’s champs, gaining enough
points for Imperial to rank 2nd team despite
competing alone, he was the main medal hope.
Having a team this time however meant oppor-
tunities to compete in team events such as the
team sprint.
A surprise entry from Staffordshire’s Dave
Readle, a track cyclist turned mature student,
who has piloted tandems in international races
for Great Britain as well as being a regular on
the domestic circuit meant Sherwood was pret-
ty much resigned to Silver medals at best.
The qualifying 200m time trial for the knock-
out match sprint competition went as expected.
Readle posting a BUCS record of 11.171 sec-
onds with Sherwood only able to produce an
11.547 second ride to qualify in second spot.
So it looked like Readle and Sherwood were
on course for a showdown in the final and that
was how it progressed through the rounds with
both easily dispatching all opponents. The
best of three rides final was then Sherwood vs
Readle with the odds heavily stacked against
Sherwood. Despite strong tactical rides from
Sherwood, managing to open up a gap between
himself and Readle both rides, he was ultimate-
ly overhauled by Readle’s top end speed to see
the final settled in two rides.
A similar result was born out in the kilometre
time trial. Sherwood set a personal best time of
1.09.041 despite having to overtake the com-
petitor riding simultaneously at the other side
of the track. But again Readle showed his class,
smashing the BUCS record held by quadruple
Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy with a time
of 1.06.327.
In the team sprint Sherwood teamed up with
Palmer and Gillam for the 750m dash. They
came home in 4th with a respectable time of
56.069. Not bad considering two of the team
had not ridden on a Velodrome let alone in this
technical team event before.
The final medal opportunity for Sherwood
was planned to be the eight lap kieren race, fea-
turing eight sprinters and a motorbike. Unfor-
tunately the notoriously lax student time keep-
ing took its toll and a slipping schedule meant
the event was cancelled.
A relatively successful weekend for the team,
gaining 20 BUCS points from the races. Unfor-
tunately, despite gaining two more points than
last year, strong showings from other teams
meant Imperial only placed 4th in the team
competition, missing out on team points.
