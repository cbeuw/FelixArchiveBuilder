I
t’s been a week of pain for me:
Physical pain, mental pain and
the unbearable cringe-worthy
pain of listening to ‘Felix radio’.
It’s like having an audio sup-
plement to my electricity bill. I know
you’re, by now, well-accustomed to my
bitter nature, but this week has been a
particularly infuriating one, and has left
me even more venomous than usual.
It all began with the fireworks... ( Cue
flahshback with dreamy flashback mu-
sic. Du lu lu lu lu luuu)
Saturday 6th November
Bonfire night. An annual celebration
of failure. Guy Fawkes sets out to assas-
sinate the king and ends up dead, leav-
ing the king very much unassassinated.
We’re celebrating something that didn’t
happen. It’s like having a birthday party
for an aborted foetus. (Oh get over it! At
least I haven’t actually aborted a foetus).
Dickens didn’t write ‘A Bonfire Carol’,
but if he did, I’d definitely be the de-
testable protagonist. I’m the scrooge of
Bonfire night, and no stupid ghost is go-
ing to persuade me to change my ways.
Unless they were willing to perhaps oc-
casionally write my Hangman article.
They could be my (Teehee) Ghost writ-
ers. (Oh get over it! At least it wasn’t an
abortion joke)
I hate everything about Bonfire night:
the bonfire, the fireworks and the peo-
ple. Why does everyone suddenly think
they’re my friend now that we’re all
at the Bonfire night together? It’s that
nauseous sense of ‘family atmosphere’.
Families ruin everything. A family event
becomes a family warzone with every
family trying to out-family the other
family. You really think that the Dad has
put his daughter on his shoulders to give
her a better view of the bonfire? No! He
simply has the height advantage now
for a one-on-one. It’s a show of power.
When a mum gives her child a sparkler
and puts him in the fenced-off ‘safety
zone’, do you think she wants him to
have fun? Of course not! She just wants
him to look cute and adorable. Do you
ever see an ugly kid with a sparkler? No!
Of course not! Ugly kids are left in the
car because they’re a fucking disgrace to
the family.
Christ, I haven’t even started on the
fireworks. My friend dragged me along
this year, insisting that I’d enjoy the dis-
play (just like those fucking ghosts). He
was wrong. Call me a sophisticated hu-
man being, but pretty colours and noises
just don’t excite me – couldn’t believe
I’d missed X factor for this. And why
does everyone have to go ‘ooooooh’ and
‘aaaaaaahhh’ like amateur porn stars
faking an orgasm? And for every single
fucking firework!? I felt like I was at-
tending some pagan ritual. For a horrible
second I thought they might sacrifice the
children to the gods and throw them on
the bonfire. I guess if they did the ugly
ones, it wouldn’t have been such a bad
thing.
Until I see a firework embody the
shape of a dragon and descend upon a
startled crowd then fireworks will al-
ways just be stupid flashy bang colours.
God Bless you Gandalf.
Bonfire night was just a minor nui-
sance this week, however. A simple
mistake I will never make again! When
I was talking about physical pain earlier,
I wasn’t lying. I’ve been an invalid for
the last four days, on a cocktail of pain-
killers and antibiotics just for a fucking
toothache!
Let me tell you that time flies when
you’re either screaming with agony into
a pillow (neighbours called the police on
the first night, presumably because they
thought I was being raped, so thought I
should muffle my cries the next time),
or unconscious-verging-comatose from
taking so many opiate-based painkillers.
I have an abscess on the root of my tooth
and it feels like someone is repeatedly
hacking away at my jaw with a blunt
axe, rubbing it with salt and then piss-
ing on it with acid. I don’t even know if
it’s possible to piss acid, but I definitely
know what it’s like to be pissed on with
acid. Of course, with a full-time sched-
ule of screaming, sleeping and mildly
hallucinating, I didn’t find much time
to tell Kadhim that I may not be able to
write anything for Hangman this week.
And so that’s why, at 5.30 in the morn-
ing of the day that this issue of Felix
is sent to the printers, I’m just ranting
about fireworks and toothaches. Well,
whilst I’m here and pissed off I might
as well mention the Asylum seekers that
have been left untouched for the last few
weeks. Yeah, that’s right I’m talking
about you Drunken Mate of the week
and Horoscopes! What happened to
Coffee Break huh? Come crawling over
to my section and think I won’t even no-
tice!? Think you can take advantage of
a guy with toothache? You’re sick! God
damn, if McPickle hadn’t rescued my
dick from that beehive whilst I was lick-
ing AIDS from a cat, then I’d send you
back to that lesser-shithole you came
from! THIS ISN’T OVER! THIS ISN’T
OVVVEEEERRRRRR!!!
It’s totally over, there’s nothing I can
do about it.
Hangman pisses on
his own bonfire
Or is it ‘her’own bonfire? Eh, eh? ...
Oh yah, so like fire is so representative of like... emotion yah. *choke... oh gawd, hold on,
yah I think my own intestine is coming up to strangle me
