R.T. S M Y T H gives a p r a g m a t i c view o f postgraduates
B E F O R E C O M I N G to Imperial C o l l e g e
I spent several years in industry and dur-
ing that time I came into contact with
very few people who possessed post-
graduate qualifications . T h o s e I did meet
always impressed me with their ability
to completely lose me in a t e c h n i c a l d i s -
c u s s i o n . T h i s resulted in me believing,
as do the vast majority of common folk,
that the select few who embelish their
name with selections from the alphabet
must possess infinite wisdom and
ability .
"(Postgraduates')... extra three
years at University ... are aimed at
perfecting their ability to ask un-
answerable questions?' ' *
I now know that this is not true for
after careful study of P G ' s I am to re-
v e a l ' t h e secret play by which a l l post-
graduates are trained to gain immediate
advantage over a l l human beings. Their
three extra years at University are not
intended as an opportunity for the dev-
elopment of deductive and managerial
s k i l l s but are aimed at perfecting their
ability to ask unanswerable q u e s t i o n s .
The questions must however relate the
one topic with which P G ' s have ex-
c l u s i v e knowledge, ie their thesis .
Unfortunately on completion of his
course the P G has only one advantage
over the average graduate. T h i s is a
profound knowledge of an e x c l u s i v e and
invariably u s e l e s s area of s c i e n c e , lit-
erature history or whatever. The e x c l u s -
iveness of this knowledge is h i s only
protection against attack by those who
may w i s h to probe his a b i l i t y . At the
same time it remains a powerful weapon
for intimidating fellow contestants in the
rate race of l i f e .
It is not suprising that when a P G
seeks employment he faces the bitter
realisation that his extra years at univer-
sity mean little or nothing to prospective
industrial employers. The result is that
a l l to often he seeks further refuge w i t h -
in the University inventing new areas of
research that w i l l enable new generations
of graduates to achieve a useless degree
of exclusiveness.
Examination of the process that c h a -
nges a bright, keen and potentially use-
ful graduate into a d i s i l l u s i o n e d post-
graduate is very revealing.
"Here, the supervisor establishes
his superiority be being able to "sug-
gest" the most impractical subjects
for research."
•Within the first few days of becoming
a top 2% man, the softening-up process
begins. A secret s e s s i o n takes place be-
tween student and supervisor. Here the
supervisor establishes his superiority by
being able to " s u g g e s t " the most im-
practical subjects for research. Any ideas
the student may have for doing worth-
while work are ruthlessly d i s m i s s e d by a
torrent of unanswerable q u e s t i o n s .
When indoctrination of the student is
complete, he is allowed to escape to the
library where the next act of the farce
takes place. Here the student faces his
first and only real test. He must est-
a b l i s h beyond any doubt that nobody has
ever attempted to investigate his pro-
posed area of work, or if this has been
done then it must be established that the
method of investigation was so different
that a meaningful comparison of results
w i l l never be possible. F a i l u r e to carry
out this part of the project thoroughly
can cause acute embarassment in the
future if someone is able to answer the
unanswerable question.
Secure in the knowledge that nobody
has ever shown an interest in the pro-
posed' area of study, the student then
wastes at least one year building his
experimental apparatus, or a least re-
arranging equipment left by his predec-
e s s o r s . The uniqueness of the experimen-
tal equipment is the student's insurance
policy against possible failure to pro-
duce positive results. A l l measurements
are made by indirect methods so that
s p e c i a l conversion factors have to be
applied before any data becomes compre-
h e n s i b l e . B e s i d e s maintaining the e s s e n -
tial e x c l u s i v e n e s s of the work, this has
two other advantages. The calibration
curves serve as useful padding for the
thesis and it becomes almost impossible
for the supervisor to check on one's pro-
gress .
"The uniqueness of. the experi-
mental equipment is the student's in*
surance policy against possible fail-
ure to produce positive results,"
During the first two years of his pro-
ject, the student has time to indulge in
a few diversionary pastimes like croquet,
squash or chasing the blues on the river.
Evenings may be spent in idle gossip
about how fast we should dip our paddles
in and out for maximum effect. Very
Freudian,
T h i s i d y l l i c time is however interrup-
ted by the compulsary c o l l o q u i a . The
secret here is to speak in a loud but i n -
distinct voice for fifty minutes, the aud-
ience having been totally lost after five
minutes otherwise question time can be
nasty as rival students and their super-
visors try to impress each other by mak-
ing the speaker appear stupid. Unfort-
unately this happens a l l too often and
the student who recognises beforehand
that he is stupid w i l l lace his talk with
red herrings to cause infighting amongst
the s u p e r v i s o r s . Never a pretty sight.
Absolute silence or total chaoes are the
surefire signs that the student has s u c -
ceeded In being transferred from M P h i l
to Ph D .
A frantic c o l l e c t i n g of experimental
data marks the next stage of the training
programme for make-your-mind-up-time is
coming. Do you write your thesis now or
produce a few extra graphs? A second
v i s i t is made to the library to check that
nobody else has been stupid enough to of
recently published anything related to
ones own work.
The time that should be spent writing-
up is dissipated by persuing games of
chance such as bridge, horse racing, war
games, and running a book on one's c h a n -
ces of surviving the approaching viva is
often profitable .
Viva Day is the day of judgement
when one<"is a s s e s s e d for a b i l i t y to de-
flect answerable questions and to a s k a
gentleman so that the examiner need not
fear that you w i l l threaten his position
some time in the future.
"What company shall I bless with my
unlimited talents?" soon becomes a plea
for now the student is dealing with pro-
fessional ego-deflaters who delight in
remarks like "Research? Ah, yes, that's
the thing we can't afford to do when
things are bad, and what we haven't got
time for when things are good".
"Absolute silence or total chaos
(at colloquia) are the surefire signs
that the student has succeeded in be-
ing transferred from M Phil to Ph D."
In the unlikely event that an offer of
employment is made, the salary w i l l be
no better than it would be for a graduate
and considerably less than a B r i t i s h Rail
porter would accept. The reason for this
is simple .The employer knowns that the
student has a l w a y s existed on a pittance,
whilst the porter has not had the benefit
of e x c l u s i v e education to enable him to
survive or such a small amount, he ob-
viously requires more.
T h i s is the price paid for becoming
an e x c l u s i v e member of society. If no-
body understands what the P G knows,
how can his value be a s s e s s e d ? Whats
more, the postgraduate's obvious a b i l i t y
to lose people in technical d i s c u s s i o n
w i l l win few friends and supporters in
the outside world.
