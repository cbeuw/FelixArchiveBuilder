ICPGG COMMENTS ON ITS . . .
CYCP SUBMISSION
THE COMMITTEE of Vice-Chancellors and College Princi-
pals in response to criticism expressed in certain quarters about
postgraduate education decided to set up a study group to look
into all aspects of this subject. Although the IC postgraduate
group was not asked for a submission, it has been decided to pre-
sent one anyway, in order to ensure that student opinion was not
overlooked.
P r o p o s a l s were submitted
in each of the following a r e a s .
1. T h e 'support' grant system
2 . Supervision and T r a i n i n g
3 . P e r i o d of study
4. T h e status of postgraduates
5. U n i o n i s a t i o n and Represent-
order to rectify this, we pro-
posed that a l l projects should
be fully d i s c u s s e d at section-

A brief summary of the var-
ious sections i s presented be-
low:
1 . The 'support' grant system.
At present research c o u n c i l s
award 'support' grants directly
to various departments .We felt
that a change i n the system
whereby the research support
grant i s awarded to the student
would improve the status of
the P G and encourage super-
visors to offer more interest-
ing and viable research pro-
jects. The departments would
then a l s o find i t imperative to
provide adequate research fac-
i l i t i e s .
2. Supervision and Training.
T y i n g a student to one sup-
ervisor is not entirely s a t i s -
factory e s p e c i a l l y i n the case
of academic staff who have too
high an administrative work-
load and other outside commit-
ments . Joint supervision is a
p o s s i b l e solution to this pro-
blem .
A n unnecessarily large
number of projects end up be-
ing non-viable, due to inade-
quate prior preparation. In
sophisticated design, imple-
mentation and a n a l y s i s . In con-
sequence the time required for
research work and i t s writing
up has increased considerably
over the past few years.
The I C P G G therefore pro-
poses that where a n extension
i s unavoidable, students
al meetings before they are
presented to the student.
F i n a l l y , intensive super-
v i s i o n coupled with more form-
al training during the i n i t i a l
period of research work would
enable the students to u t i l i z e
their time a n d a b i l i t y , more
effectively than i s the case at
present.
should continue to get the nec-
essary financial support.
4. The status of postgraduates
Research work c a n in gen-
eral be c l a s s i f i e d as l y i n g
somewhere i n a continuum be-
tween the very personal pro-
ject of one research student,
and the quari-research a s s i s t -
antship type of work where the
problem and the strategy for
its solution have been exter-
nally defined by a supervisor.
Most of the work carried out at
IC tends to be of the latter
type.
In the short term we propose
increasing the proportion of
P h D research students who are
financed as research a s s i s -
tants on r e a l i s t i c s a l a r i e s ,
while i n the long term a salary
structure should be introduced
for a l l research workers taking
account of the notion of com-
pensation for limited autonomy.
5. Unionisation and Represent-
ation.
The Student union should
serve this purpose but it de-
monstrably fails . A separate
postgraduate union would pro-
bably be counter productive.
E s t a b l i s h e d trade unions c a n
never really represent a l l the
requirements of postgraduate
students. T h e I C P G G should
fulfil this role but i n order to
increase its effectiveness a
sabbatical year should be pro-
vided for the Chairman.
In view of the large number
of postgraduate students at
IC we would like to see sep-
arate P G representation on the
major College committees.
6. Part-time teaching.
There has been a lot of
d i s c u s s i o n on this t o p i c . It
remains the firm p o l i c y of I C
P G G that P G ' s engaged i n
part-time teaching a c t i v i t i e s
should be paid at the economic
rate and not considered as
cheap labour.
7. Overseas Students .
The high proportion of over-
seas students seems to be
causing concern in certain
quarters. I C P G G maintains
that the benefits of having
overseas students outweighs
the marginal financial saving
that might accrue by a drastic
reduction of the number of"
overseas postgraduates.
*
In c o n c l u s i o n , some of the
earlier proposals might, to
some degree, compromise the
autonomy of various sections
and departments. T h e benefits
which w i l l result are of greater
importance than the slight re-
duction in'academic freedom'.
