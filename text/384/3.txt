CORNER
Tom Abraham
T H E R A B B L E are away and it sure is nice and peaceful.
Much as we would like It to remain that way, I am afraid they w i l l
be back next week. However let us enjoy the peace and quiet
whi le it lasts.
Two important events are coming up next term. There is the
Postgraduate Group Executive,
namely Chairman (who a l s o
acts as P G A O ) , Secretary and
Treasurer, and the not quite
so serious business of the
Annual Dinner.
F i r s t about the e l e c t i o n s .
A s you may have noticed we
do not hold these at the same
time as the general rabble.
Instead, we hold them at the
beginning of the third term.
The nomination papers w i l l be
up the requisite number of
days before the Annual Gener-
al Meeting, with the actual elr
ection taking place at this
meeting. The job of Chairman
can be both interesting and
rewarding. It a l s o helps In
developing any latent leader-
ship q u a l i t i e s . Any postgrad-
uate who wants to know more
about the post should get In
touch with me (Int. 3T03).
For the first time ever we
hope to have a postgraduate
annual dinner. There seems to
be a great deal of interest in
having such a dinner. We hope
to organise it for sometime to-
wards the end of the term. T i c -
ket w i l l be available from the
departmental postgraduate reps
as soon as the details are
finalised.
The Postgraduate Group
has done fairly well as far as
the internal organisation is
c o n c e r n e d . We have some
strong groups and a few emb-
ryo groups in most of the de-
partments. The two major de-
partments when these has not
been much activity have been
P h y s i c s and Mechanical E n g -
ineering. While there has been
some sort of interest In Phy-
s i c s , the Mechanical E n g i n -
eers have been steadfast In
s t i c k i n g to their self-proclaim-
ed policy of isolationism. The
irony Is that on the whole they
can be a sociable lot. I am
hopeful that something can be
done to purge them o b their
isolationist tendencies.
Relations with IC Union
are at a low ebb at present.
During my term of office I have
tried to llase with the Union
and by and large, we have been
able to co-operate on most
i s s u e s . One of the main rea-
sons for this has been Trev
P h i l l i p s ' personal interest in
postgraduates. The other un-
ion officers, although in some
instances sympathetic towards
the P G ' s , seem unable to com-
prehend the many issues fac-
ing us. The road forward as
far as the Postgraduate Group
is concerned would, I believe,
lie In taking an independent
l i n e . W e should be responsible
for the interest of the 1600
postgraduates In this college
because neither the C C U ' s
nor ICU seem capable of ful-
filling such a role. The almost
total (except for a few imma-
ture P G ' s ) apathy of P G ' s to-
wards the C C U ' s cannot be
d i s m i s s e d in terms of the
usual student apathy towards
unions. Most postgraduates
feel that the C C U ' s are irre-
levant a s far as they are c o n -
cerned. I must add that In my
personal opinion the C C U ' s do
a goob job in involving the u n -
dergraduates in their various
a c t i v i t i e s , but they seem un-
able or in some c a s e s uninter-
ested in encouraging P G part-
icipation. There a l s o seems to
be some sort of socio-cultural
'age' gap between P G ' s and
undergraduates w h i c h both
s i d e s tacitly accept, and
which neither is interested in
bridging. It Is therefore e s s e n -
tial that the P G Group takes
on fully the job of looking
after the interests of postgrad-
uates, and force IC Union and
the College to recognise and
accept It in this role.
F i n a l l y there are s t i l l many
issues to be t a c k l e d . The
chief among these is obtaining
adequate safequards with re-
gard both to the v i a b i l i t y and
financing of research work.
The fact that the e x i s t i n g s i t -
uation is pretty grim has to be
brought to the notice of the
C o l l e g e and academic staff.
The recognition of this pro-
blem is a necessary prere-
quisite to finding its s o l u t i o n .
