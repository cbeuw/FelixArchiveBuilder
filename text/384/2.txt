AS T H E Easter vacation draws to a close and one tries
to recollect what has happened during this period, the
sentence "nothing has really happened at all" predictably
springs to mind. The undergrads are away; the PGTs are
grinding on with their work as usual; the College i s barely
ticking over. So why produce a vacation F E L I X ? You may
well a s k .
In its twenty-five year history, F E L I X has never been
produced in the Easter vac until now. So in many respects,
this issue can be thought of an experimental pilot scheme.
Its success or failure has depended on the response for
copy from P G ' s . I have to thank Tom Abraham, the Chair-
man of the ICPGG, and a l l the other contributors for
extracting their mattire digits and displaying the immense
creative writing potential that exists amongst P G ' s . .
Where have you all been hiding?
I hope that the concept of F E L I X vacation issues will
create some interest i n P G circles and then possibly
develop into the issues of the year where P G ' s can freely
express themselves knowing that what they write will, on
the whole be read by just other P G ' s .
Here, then, is one opportunity whereby P G ' s can attempt
to throw off their 'hyper-apathetic' image .

Nationally, the referendum debate looks as though it i s
going to get tough and possibly more dirty. As one national
newspaper put it recently: what with the anti-market lobby
being supported by the Communists, the National Front,
Enoch Powell, the IRA, the left wing of the Labour Party
and the Trade Unions, the country will undoubtedly vote
overwhelmingly 'yes' to the Common Market.
Anxious to contribute to the discussion on this subject,
F E L I X has joined forces with ICWA's new President,
Stella Godfrey, in an effort to present a formal debate
within the College. A provisional date has been set for
this event and we hope to be able to attract some prominent
politicians to speak. It is also hoped to get some students
to speak on the debate as well: if there are any P G ' s
interested, ring the F E L I X office sometime next week.

You must be kidding! Seeking employment i s not s o much a
joy, but much more a way of strife .
What prospects have w e , with a degree from I C ? Better than
average, maybe? We, the job seekers, are desperately trying to
s e l l a commodity in an open-market where prices (salaries) are
related to demand. A n d for
most of u s , there i s a glut in
the market .With a first degree,
one can s e l l one's soul to a
prospective employer for a be-
low average standard of l i v i n g .
The employer finds such a buy
a real bargain, works for pea-
nuts, partly trained and can fit
into many spheres. But what
about a higher degree? Those
three years a s a P G are con-
sidered irrelevant to most pro-
spective employers, a s work
on some 'white elephant' pro-
ject, though to the college
authorities, it is "academic
training'. Not wanting to e m -
ploy such a person, a s they
have to pay a higher salary
for a P h D degree to someone
three years older than a new
graduate, they s a y 'You are
too specialized for us'.
Not many P h D ' s continue to
work in the same field but
there are those who, removed
from reality, w i s h to continue
working In such fields a s elec-
trical conduction in gorgonzola
or pig-farming in Israel.
Why are we in our present
field of work? Perhaps, like
me, y o u were told, "this is
the in-field in which to be for
a secure job and a bright fut-
ure". I won't be surprised if
the Careers' A d v i s o r is s i n g -
ing the same tune.
The irony of the problem i s
that some who could not keep
up in this field have dropped
out to far better things - good
standard of living, secure and
interesting jobs, bright future,
is, then, this s a c i f i c e worth
the agony of facing a tight-
fisted employer asking s i l l y
questions like, "why do you
want to work for us?" or
"where do you see yourself in
five years from now?" "We'll
let you know if we want you!"
Tea-boys a n d secretaries
are paid exhorbitant rates and
s t i l l demand more, while pro-
fessionals are content to s a y
that they are only working for
the enjoyment and not the s a l -
ary. T h i s attitude only port-
rays professionals a s being
eccentrics contemplating their
own importance and deprives
the recent graduates of getting
better deals for themselves.
To add insult to injuiry, w e
are even deprived of Unem-
ployment Benefits. T o shrug
off s o c i a l responsibility the
government h a s s e t up the
P E R , known by the starving
unemployed to be a waste of
time. A r e these the joys to
which we once looked forward?

A t the moment most P . G . s are faced with poor job prospects.
Most parameters influencing this state of affairs are beyond the
P . G . s ' power to control .However, the P . G . group is not com-
pletely without some means of improving matters. T w o things
can be done.
F i r s t , it may be helpful to
try to achieve a higher degree
of co-ordination between re-
search a c t i v i t i e s at College
with those of institutions
P . G ' s are likely to seek em-
ployment at, when they finish
their C o l l e g e training. T h e
lack of new posts for Univer-
sity lecturers w i l l mean more
s c i e n c e and engineering P C s
going for jobs in industry or
government run establishments.
The nature of employment w i l l
vary depending on whether the
P. G . is an M.Sc. or a P h D ,
in general the former tending
to go for developement, pro-
duction or management and
the latter for pure or applied
research. Future efforts by
the P . G . group directed t o -
wards this coordination of re-
search a c t i v i t i e s may help
the P . G . find a job by making
his college training more
readily acceptable to his fut-
ure employer.
Secondly, support by the
P . G . group for more interde-
partmental courses can help
the situation further. The rea-
son for this i s two fold. F i r s t -
ly, P . G . s often find that by
the time they have finished
their college training their
field of s p e c i a l i s a t i o n is no
longer important enough for
them to continue it somewhere
else-hence they have to move
to another field .Secondly,
qyerjap between engineering
and applied s c i e n c e fields
means the P . G . must havs a
good general knowledge in
these various fields even,
though some of this knowledge
may not bear directly on h i s
P h D .project. The answer
lies in organising a series of
lectures up to M . S c . level that
can be attended by both M . S c .
and P h D . students. A n e x c e l -
lent example of this is the
interdepartmental M . S c . course
on Science of Materials. T h e
course draws its lecturers
from a number of departments
and provides a good under-
standing of the p h y s i c s , chem-
istry and metallurgy of mater-
ials and their uses in the var-
ious engineering fields. P . G . s
following the course find they •
can be flexible enough to move
between d i s c i p l i n e s . Hence
further cooperation between
departments in other advanced
fields is"ip the interes-te of
the P . G .
