iAVE YOU LOST SOMETHING?
Suspicious goings-on outside Garden i a l l were reported during the e a r l y hours of
Saturday morning by Dave M i t c h e l l , ..ero -AG. W h i l s t naking toast at 5 a.m., he saw
f i v e souths and a g i r l l o i t e r i n g near a car parked outside the l a l l . When he looked
again, tlie car was gone. Other s n a i l incidents had been n o t i c e d and the p o l i c e were ••
c a l l e d .
The next morning, no car thefts ware reported, but several car locks had been
forced open. The dotmobile owned by the warden of Garden l a l l , Mr. ? , Minton, was
among the four v e h i c l e s i n t e r f e r e d w i t h . Is anyone missimg a car?
TIB SCRUFFS OF I . C .
ilave you ever sat i n Kooney's establishment perusing the 'a l a c a r t e ' and i d l y
looked at the dress of the c l i e n t e l e ? Ghastly, i s n ' t i t ? Why do the U n i v e r s i t y students
i n s i s t on wearing the worst clothes i n London? Surely trousers w i t h a crease must be
preferable to those things c a l l e d ' j e a n s ' with bulbous knees and sagging bottoms - can
there be any other e s t a b l i shuent i n England where the men of supposedly high i n t e l l e c t
appear for work i n such a manner. The polo-necked sweater (doesn't need washingso o f t e n [
d i r t y jacket and the shoes which l a s t saw Cherry Blossom at t h e i r b i r t h , seem to be
the u n i v e r s a l marks of the student. Can i t be wondered that other teenagers, not so
fortunate, t r y to imitate t h e i r so c a l l e d b e t t e r s ?
Good clothes are expensive, but they wear and look so much better than t h e i r
cheap counterparts, so you man of I . C . why not set an example to the r e s t of London's
students, You're not even u r t i s t s so you c a n ' t use that excuse, you're meant to be the
future top minds i n science, ana s u r e l y a s c i e n t i s t should be orderly i n body as w e l l
as i n mind.
I n c i d e n t l y , some of the women students at t h i s college should read t h i s as w e l l ,
a m i n o r i t y are as bad as the men,

AUDIENCE EXPLOSION FOR HUXSOC.
As expected, the Thursday meeting i n the Population Control Week, devoted to the
subject of o r a l contraception, was packed, 'Peace of M i n d ' , the f i l m made by G.D.
Searle & C o . , w h i l e obviously not designed for an audience of our i n t e l l e c t u a l d i s -

cramps and pre-menstrual tension also tend to disappear. The p i l l also seems to reduce
the incidence of c e r v i c a l cancer i n those women using i t . As the other f i l m showed, at

for one think i t was high - the a d v e r t i s i n g for-the week was not l a c k i n g i n quantity,
ilave people had too much p u b l i c i t y for the Population Problem thrust at them?
