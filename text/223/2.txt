LIVING I
" T,IFE : Living or Existing"
was the subject tor the
ICCD's first meeting in their
series " Why Believe," on Novem-
ber 15th.
Ed* Reis, from the U S A society
" T h e Navigators," talked on this
subject, basing his arguments on the
premise that people who are active
Christians are living to the full; that
once a person becomes actively com-
mitted to Christ then his life com-
pletely changes, takes on a new
meaning and purpose, and has more
significance.
He chose St. Paul as an example,
siaying th?:t before his cc \ version,
Paul had only lived in the sense of
existing; his life was unsatisfactory
and purposeless; afterwards however,
he achieved a new goal in life and
realised the power of Christianity.
UNJUSTIFIED ASSUMPTION
Mr. Reis, apart from the very
feeble jokes and the obvious meta-
phors, (which seem to be an occupa-
tional hazard of many I C C U meet-
ings), had presented his argument
clearly and logically.
But then he continued with the
basic assumption that everybody who
was not a Christian could not possibly
be as happy," or their life could not
be so meaningful, as it would were
they to become one. He did not
justify this, but he proceeded to ex-
pand it to the point that the only way
to achieve a state of grace is to
become a Christian. The audience
accepted this, without demurring, and
proceeded to soak in the usual cliches
and assertions which followed on for
the. next twenty minutes with obvious
relish, or else with complete boredom,
(but with no stages of interest between
these extremes).
Thus the objectives cf the meeting,
which was to inform an J interest
non-Christians, was not acheved.

N O R T H E R N CENSORSHIP
The Newspaper of Rutherford
College of Technology now re-
fuses to name who produces it, or
where it is produced in order to
avoid " the indignity of censor-
ship by College authorities."
The Editor claims that the au-
thorities want to prevent unfav-
ourable impressions of the Col-
lege reaching outsiders.

H E L P F U L M E N IN B L U E
The police, often accused of
being bad-tempered during stu-
dent jollifications, contributed
greatly to the celebrations at
Bristol concerning the Lord
Mayor's annual Grant to Wills
Hall, by coating the War Mem-
orial—a favourite object for
climbing, with black grease. This
sort of action will have a far
better effect than simply banning
any such actions, and is less likely
to lead to frayed tempers.

Another Phoenix
Jones Appeals
Mervyn Jones speaks to Peter Combes
n r m S ACADEMIC, year's first issue of Phoenix comes out on
Monday, December 13th. As a preview to the new issue, Felix
talked to the Editor of Phoenix, Mervyn Jones.
On being asked what he thought the
aims of the magazine were, he replied:
" Phoenix was started in 1885 by H.
G . Wells. Since then it has varied
from being virtually a newspaper, re-
porting such things as deaths of mem-
bers during the Great War, to the
other extreme—completely a literary
magazine.
" I believe that Phoenix should be
a mixture of these two extremes. It
should contain good literary contribu-
tions and it should also be used by
students as a platform for airing their
views or ideas.
"At the moment the few people who
actually think about the Union do not
bother to write anything because they
do not reckon they are good enough.
\ believe that students should take an
interns in Phoenix, as it is the only
College publication apart from Felix,
and is therefore important."
The forthcoming issue of Phoenix con-
tains articles on the Haldane Library,
Halls of Residence, short stories, and
two poems by Patric Dickinson, the
famous British poet, and visiting
lecturer to I.C.
Finally, Mervyn Jones pleaded for
more staff, and contributions for the
issue coming out at the end of next
term. People interested should con-
tact him via the Union Rack or Room
525, Tizard Hall.
