IN WITHA CHANCE
THIS S A T U R D A Y I.C. are playing
in the first round of the University of
London Cup. There are three separ-
ate cups to be won; the Challenge
Cup, the Upper Reserves Cup and the
Lower Reserves C u p . In the Chal-
lenge Cup, the first team are playing
U.C. at Harlington. This year, dili-
gent preparations are being made to
form a team combination capable of
bringing the Cup back to I.C.. This
takes the form of training together
with the University players eligible
for the competition. In addition,
efforts are being made to invite pro-
fessional players to discuss tactics with
the team in order to get some measure
of unity .among the players.
In previous years it could be said
that I.C. had too many players who
could not be expected to combine
well with the nucleus of the regular
League team for just three games a
year. However, this year, as there are
only two such players, a better degree
of combination should be ^achieved.
The first team prospects against
U.C. look reasonably favourable,
having already drawn with tham in
the League with a slightly weakened
team. The only other stumbling
block before the final will be King's,
but if the team starts playing well we
hope to be there.

GOOD SHOT
A W I N N I N G S T R E A K by the Rifle
Club, both teams have been shoot-
ing well. The A team shot against
Kings on 17th November, and, despite
dismal scores from all except Martin
Bregrer and Bob Kennett, substantially
beat them by 8 points. This victory
was followed up on 21st November by
a five point win over Battersea, with
good shooting from the whole team.
The B team shot for the first time
on 22nd November against Barts, at
home. Averaged 95, which was
enough t o . soundly beat the Barts
team even allowing for the bad luck
of one of their members, whose light
rifle jammed, and who consequently
obtained 58 with an I C rifle.
RIGHT TACK
T H E R I V E R H A M B L E was the scene
of a sailing victory over Southampton
and an equally succesful away match
was sailed against Leicester, despite
dubious winds and natural hazards at
the bottom of a disused granite quarry,
the venue of the Leicester club. Q M C
suffered a similar defeat at the Welsh
Harp, but a match against Battersea
had to be abandoned because of gale
force winds.
The college has maintained a strong
position in the University " A " points
series, and comprises a high propor-
tion of the University of London 1st
team.
