Unfit for job?
JiV your leading report on the
front page of the last issue, a
particularly nasty and unnecessary
reference was made to my charac-
ter. This reference directly im-
plied that I was unfitted for my
job on Union Council.
Whilst I admit that you attributed
these remarks to Barry Mair, you
kiow as well as I do that you as
Editor must be held directly respon-
sible for anything that is written in
your newspaper. It is in this con-
text that I must level a direct charge
at you : you seem to be basically un-
able to appreciate that people do not
like being bandied around college as
rankly incompetent. Mike Scott and
Chris Hocking have already come
tinder your little chopper; it now
seems to be my turn.
Far be it fon me, however, to sug-
gest that you s op criticising people :
but I do demand that any criticism
you print should be constructive and
based on fact, instead of being highly
destructive and calculated to cast in-
nuendos.
For if this sort of thing continues,
doubt will certainly be cast upon
your ability to run a college news-
paper and another Editor will have
to come from the blue.

Mikado Apathy
XXTITH reference to Mr. Wailum's
article in your last issue, com-
plaining of lack of publicity in Col-
lege for " The Mikado," it should be
noted that members of the college are
by and large apathetic with regard to
forming an audience for such an
event.
Unless this attitude changes radi-
cally, the College does not justify the
expense and expenditure involved in
the " high-pressure advertising " he so
lightly mentions.

Look again at Woolworths, as they

and earrings and also new giant pen-

recently brought out a new kind of

(not necessarily for the chicks.), if
you're too chicken to have your ears

Rice & Mot Pies
FOR ANY of you who do like rice,
here's an almost " never fail"
quantity recipe. Rice is generally
measured i n cups, so you just double
the quantities. In other words, for,
say, five good helpings, use 2 | cupfuls
of rice to five of water. Bring to the
boil quickly, add salt to taste, if
savoury, then lower heat and put a
lid on. Keep testing, and you should
find it allright within 15 minutes. A
favourite " home-made " recipe of a
girl-friend of mine would go well on
a bed of rice. Begin frying some
onions slowly in oil, preferably before
you start the rice, and then add some
minced steak, about l i b . for the
above rice, a little streaky bacon and
about 5 tomatoes. When all are
cooked, stir i n a smallish tin of
tomato puree and divide on to the
Now the cold winter nights have
really set in, did you know that the
Peppermill Supermarket in the O l d
Brompton Road do hot pies? If you
live far away you can re-heat them
with vegetables. Containing steak
and mushrooms; steak and onion;
steak and kidney, turkey, etc., in puff
pastry, they are all about Is. 6d.
If you are just plain lazy, or can't
cook, Bird's Eye are helping you
with their individual or instant meals,
boxed at 3s. 6d. They contain meat
and two vegetables i n separated foil
trays, and you just heat in the oven.
P.S. " Lazy." but not slimming? Then
you can find delicious new potatoes
in a tin i n the London M . & S.'s for
your store shelves; just warm and add
a knob of butter or fry.
a fine gilt wire and the effect makes
your ears look pierced. In gilt/pearl

worths too i n colours and black for

Peter Robinson have some good
handbags, (right next to the jewellery
counter). One I liked particularly is

I was recently looking for some
boots for the rain, but naturally more
with-it than the old school Wellington
types. Although Harrods do have
some at 55s. in shiny black, blue, red
or white in most shoe shops I
received a negative answer for some-
thing around 30s. Finally, I was in
Gallops the Heel Bar at Sth. Kensing-
ton and found a very light-weight
shiny rubber boot for 28s. 1 Id. D i d
you know that they are now cut lower
and have a litle heal, and that terribly
bulky toe has turned into a gently
rounded, much smoother one?
