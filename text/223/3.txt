BOOZE
BELLY DANCERS
BEDLAM
p RESUMABLY in an attempt to discourage unwanted visitors, the
R.C.S. Union Meeting on 23rd November was held with the
minimum of publicity.
The minutes of the last meeting were read, from which it emerged
a film of the recent Spanner as the particpants seemed to, and the
that
snatch would not be available as was
hoped. This was attributed to Guilds
refusing to return Spanner for photo-
graphing.
A shout for the Queen of Jez to
move to the platform proved unsuc-
cessful. Demurely, she preferred to
remain on the front bench.
C A R N I V A L
It was disclosed that the R.C.S.
Carnival on 3rd December would
have professional belly-dancers as
part of the entertainment. Tickets for
the event (25/- double) are now on
sale.
The proposed constitutional change
that a commitee of thre be elected
from the floor for the purposes of
publicity, under the chairmanship of
the Publicity Officer, provided a di-
version from the gravity of the rest
of the meeting. A n amendment that
each department should elect one
member for the committee was de-
feated. After a deal of wrangling, the
motion, put to the vote, was passed
almost unanimously, and now passes
to the next Union Meeting for a
second hearing.
Back to the serious side of the
meeting. The Swimming Gala was
next on the agenda. Vice-President
Ken West in black corset and stock-
ings and Secretary Ian Kershaw gave
an " exhibition" of the various
strokes to be used. The audience
knew as little of what was intended
reward for their " efforts" was an
embarrassed silence and a sense of
bewilderment. Indeed, after a time,
the executive looked as embarrassed
as the audience at this fiasco.
MISS WORLD
Ted Needham was then elected
Miss World, to be crowned at the
Swimming Gala. This about sums up
th« tone of the meeting.
Two teams of four then ran two
" boat races" in which the Union
had the pleasure of watching sixteen
pints of beer half drunk and half
spilled over the floor. After this en-
joyable climax—presumably the teams
enjoyed it anyway—came any other
business.
A n R.C.S. diary was proposed by
Ken West and he promised to look
into the feasibility of it. A complaint
about rubbish in the theatre was ac-
cepted and the treasurer's report de-
livered.
A F R I C A N
After a brief argument about
Council minutes, the meeting was
closed with a Kangela. A sad com-
ment on the meeting—even the Union
chant was misspelled three times.
Footnote : It is reported that
RCSU's Publicity Officer was too
hard-pressed over advertising Bed-
ouins to be able to afford adequate
pre-publicity to the Union Meeting.
Felix hopes that the new committee
may remedy any such recurrence.

COMPULSORY HALL DINNERS
K E O G H M E A L S ON H A L L BILL
J£EOGH H A L L has initiated a system of regular " Dining-in
evenings," the cost of which will be added each term to the hall
bill. This sweeping step was only taken after a thorough investiga-
tion (via a questionnaire) into the form these dinners should take
and the popularity of the idea itself, followed by a referendum,
ft seems that " Keoghlogians " are held every other week on Mondays,
particularly keen to meet their com-
panions in hall, so these dinners will
provide a pleasant method of becom-
ing acquainted with people not on
one's own staircase, who might other-
wise not cross one's path. When the
Hall was asked to accept or reject tne
plan, it accepted it " en masse." In
this College the result seems startling.
In other Colleges dining-in for hall
residents is often a nightly occurrence.
Nothing quite so devastating is plan-
ned in Keogh. The dinners are to be
Tuesdays or Wednesdays at 6.00 p.m.
in the Staff Dining Room, Southside.
Religious Exceptions
It should be pointed out that excep-
tions can, and will, be made for people
who, for say religious reasons, find
they are unable to attend the dinners.
Such people will merely be asked to
explain, in person, their reasons to
the Hall Committee. It is hoped the
number of these exceptions will be
minimal.

WHO BELIEVES
AGNOSTIC P.G.s, THEISTIC WOMEN
A N A L Y S I S HAS been completed of the recent survey of reli-
gious beliefs in the college, showing that against 28 per cent,
atheists, 55 per cent, of those interviewed profess to believe in God;
however 46 per cent, of the whole sample never go to church and
only 22 per cent, go weekly,
Mini-,men seem markedly irreligious
compared with the other colleges
(which havefiguresnearer to the I.C.
average), with only 9 per cent regu-
larly attending church.
A n interesting trend is the decrease
in belief in God with progression from
1st year (60 per cent) to P C s (25 per
cent), balanced by a corresponding in-
crease i n agnosticism rather than
atheism. Church-going habits however
remain constant. The girls of the col-
ledge predominantly believe i n God
(77 per cent.) but rarely attend Church
(11 per cent.).
T o the question "What do you think
of lesus C h r i s t " answers varied from
" He never existed " to " He was an
influential exponent of a social struc-
ture." 28 per cent, believed He was
the son of God but 37 per cent, that
He was something out of the ordinary.
Religion Ignored
To nearly half the college the
Christian is a product of environ-
mental pressure and a large number of
students have never given Christianity
serious consideration one way or the
other, or religious issues at all for
that matter.
A similar survey in R.C.M. revealed
a very much higher Christian bias.
Copies of the analysis can be ob-
tained from A . I. Mayo, Falmouth
Hall or Union Rack.
Ed.: The survey, carried out by I.C.
Christian Union, N O T BY F E L I X ,
which does not accept responsibility
for its accuracy, involved 15 per cent.
