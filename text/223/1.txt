LOANS PROPOSITION
BLUFF OR STRATEGY?
f ) N THURSDAY IC Union h to be
asked to " deplore any suggestion
of returnable loans to students and de-
mand full maintenance grants for
students irrespective of parental in-
come."
Keith Cavanagh, who is to propose
this motion to the lunchtime Union
Meeting, considers that the present
Government is trying to provide edu-
cation " on the cheap." This thought
follows, most recently, from the move
to increase the number of students i n
Training Colleges without extra ex-
penditure.
The motion springs from a sugges-
tion that loans should be introduced
in a letter from the Department of
Education and Science that found its
way to the national press in early
October. The problem its creates im-
mediately is whether it was intended
as bluff or as a feeler prior to some
definite action. However, it probably
heralds a hardening of attitude to-
wards increase in student grants.
In view of the element of doubt,
Mr. Cavanagh "feels that, like N U S ,
I C U should act as though it is a
serious consideration.
GUILDS DINNERS
'SUCCESS'
THE M A I N OBJECT of the Guilds
Freshers Dinners this year was to
give an opportunity to the freshers to
get to know a few members of their
staff and vice versa. The assemblages
were more subdued and refined than
last year, each dinner taking the form
of a three course meal including wine,
with beer to follow in the company
of various guests from the department
concerned.
The opinions of the heads of the
EUROPEAN SEMINAR
J)ELEGATIONS from nineteen European Countries have been
invited to the European Student Seminar of Technological Educa-
tion (ESSTE) to be conducted from 2nd—8th January, 1966. This
seminar was formed to draw a critical comparison between the teach-
ing methods in various European scientific Institutions.
They will discuss a wide range of
topics from education in schools to
their future positions in Industry.
From this they hope to help the future
development of scientific education in
Europe.
The delegation from I.C. should
include one person competed with
union affairs and one " mature stu-
dent." who will have to submit papers
on particular aspects of education at
I.C., and they must be very familiar
with the details of education here.
A Science Research Council grant
of £600 has been given by the govern-
ment towards the estimated expendi-
ture of £1750. Complete" board and
lodging will be provided at Man-
chester University, but travel to
Manchester will probably have to be
met by the delegates.
departments, and other staff who had
been present, were that the dinners
had been successful i n their purpose
and that they would probably be more
successful next year when more staff
could be persuaded to come along,
Most of the students I talked to
agreed that they had enjoyed the
evenings and had found great value
in talking to a few members of staff.
Some students who had apparently
not managed to talk to any staff felt
that the dinner had been disappoint-
ing. N o doubt the traditional freshers
festivity would have suited them. But
most of the students, including mem-
bers of the second, enjoyed themselves.

Marriage
3 RETAIN has suffered a silent
social revolution in the last
eighty years, in the institution
called marriage. So said Profes-
sor O. R. McGregor to a General
Studies meeting on Thursday,
25th November.
He informed us that during the last
century there weri> 25 per cent more
women in our country than men. This
had lead to the suffragette movement
and the eventual emancipation of
women. Equality had helped to re-
volutionise marriage.
It was explained how the husband-
and-wife " triangular " marriage had
been replaced by one democratically
based on loyalty and love. Modern
society considered it to be wrong to
marry if one is not i n love.
Surely it is also wrong for a couple
to remain married if they are no
longer in love ? During the last cen-
tury the number of broken marriages
— o r " draws on losing tickets " had
not increased, only the availability of
divorce. M I K E S M I T H .

Presidents refusing to let L S C put up
posters. Other publicity attempts—
notably the raid on Radio L o n d o n —
were "foiled by people leaking stories
to the press and by sheer bad luck."
A further possible cause for the
financial failure of Friday, 19th, is
that a large number of forged tickets
at half-price are rumoured to have
been used to gain entry to the Em-
pire Pool. Police have been brought
in to discover the source.
Regarding sponsorship by Radio

tions to Caroline Club members, and

Outsiders Not

fJURING THE KAST few week
thieving in Southside has be-
come a distinctive feature of Hall
life to its residents. In Keogh so many
articles have been lost that a circular
has been sent round, subtly asking for
stolen articles to be returned.
However, the possibility of out-
siders entering the Halls for nefarious
activities is not ruled out. Nor is this
trouble unique to Keogh. Falmouth
now has a notice in its laundry warn-
ing residents that clothes have been
stolen from it.
Besides clothing such things as
food, bicycle acessories, magazines,
kettles and money have been stolen. Out 15 December
