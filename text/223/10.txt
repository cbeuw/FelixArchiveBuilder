P H E GUILDS UNION meeting opened last Thursday in the "newest,
biggest, bestest" lecture theatre in Mech. Eng. In the new surroundings,
the large number there were not so obvious since for once everybody, apart
from I.C.U. President, found seats.
EDWARDS LOSES CONTROL
RHODESIAN DEBATE*.
NOVEMBER 25th
This was the biggest meeting the
Debating Society has had for a long
time—an audience of 200 being pre-
sent. Unfortunately it was spoilt by
much over-emotion rt rhetoric and by
continuous il-mauncr :
1 heckling
whenever anyone supported the mo-
tion—which the chairman seem in-
caoable of quelling, only calling for
order twice.
i ne main argument, of Patric Wall
proposing that " this house would riot
suport further coercive action against
Mr. Smith's Government" was that be-
cause of the intransigence of South
Africa and Portugal, any economic
sanctions are foredoomed to dis-
aster. T.ie only logical sanction, the
use of force, would involve not only
battle but full scale war, and Britain
had no right to instigate this.
Davil Ennals presented his case
logically and unemotionally to a very
tense audience. He emphasised the
political repercussions of a policy of
no further involvement, such as the
possible break up of the Common-
weath, and reiterated the need for im-
position of oil sanctions. Roger Lee,
at times inaudible from the constant
hissing and booing, gave a badly de-
livered but sound speech, handicapped
by a Rhodesian acent.
The floor produced some note-
worthy speeches, especially from M r .
Anand and M r . Lisman.
The motion was defeated by 144
votes to 29, with about 15 abstentions.

A_N E M E R G E N C Y task force
to aid in cases of sudden evic-
tion is one of the ideas envisaged
by Arthur Francis to help the
Notting Hill Housing problem.
Mr. Francis is now engaged in
forming a society to help with any
social work necessary locally. There
is, he feels, a genuine need for such
a society since all the voluntary social
work is done at present by the re-
ligious societies. No scope is afforded
the person who wishes to help in so-
cial work but does not wish to be
involved with a religious body.
The principal function of this club
—tentatively named the Organisation
for Social Services—would be to pro-
vide a link between the students in
College and any social work that
needs to be done outside the College.
A file of such work would be com-
piled and would extend as the organ-
isation grew and was able to under-
take more tasks.
In the immediate future O.S.S. is
likely to be mainly concerned with the
Notting Hill Housing Trust—remov-
ing the responsibility for organising
redecoration parties, task forces and
people to aid by simply talking to
those in need from the Carnival Com-
mittee.
Talks with officers of the religious
societies and Huxley Society have met
with favourable response, and the
club is soon to be proposed to the
Social Clubs Committee.
WHERE DID
ALL THE
PEOPLE
D Y MID-WEEK, attendance at the
two meetings already held in Popu-
lation Control Week had been disap-
pointing—despite two excellent meet-
ings. Mr. Norman of the Centre for
Urban Studies outlined lucidly the
size of the population disaster that is
descending upon us; this is what
people need: incontrovertible facts
and figures.
M r . Taylor of Oxfam showed us a
moving film about work done by
voluntary workers in post-indepen-
dence Algeria, followed by a detailed
discussion of Oxfam's work.
Every year £300 million go out of
this country to help the developing
countries; half of this comes from the
Government; of the rest, £2 million
come from Oxfam, who also, pro-
bably, make the greatest contribution,
through their advertising, to persuad-
ing the people of this country of the
need for A i d .
There is a move afoot in this Col-
lege for more social work to be out-
side; Oxfam should be high on the
list of worthy causes.
rtuyone interested i n such social
.vork, whether just for the Carnival
or all the year round, should contact
Arthur Francis at Room 26 Weeks
Hall or add their names to posters
asking for helpers for Notting Hill.

Present at the front, with the Ex-
ecutive, was Professor Ford, shortly
to become the first Guildsman ever to
head the Mech. Eng. Dept. Thus
Dai Howell continues his staff-stu-
dent relationship drive.
The routine business of the meet-
ing was dispensed with, with a mini-
mum of interruptions. A n election
was held for the I.C.W.A. representa-
tive on Guilds Council. Of the two
nominations : Professor Sir Willis
Jackson and Pam Pocock, the former
was disallowed (his nomination was
not up for a week) and Miss Pocock
was elected.
Professor Ford presented the Mor-
phy and Lowry crews with full and
half colours respectively. A Guilds
Union General Award was made to
Mr. Tom Morley for his services to
the College since 1919. He is shortly
to retire. This delightful old gentle-
man then made an amusing speech
thanking everybody and recounting
some of his experiences.
Tid Maini, Vice-president, adver-
tised the Engineers' Dinner on 28th
January, and rather embarrassedly, the
Carol Singing on 15th December.
A parade of clothing suitable for
the Swiming Gala was held under the
title " Haute Boutique Floatique,"
compered by that man's man, Rudi
Roberts. Exhibits included " M i s s
Birth Control " i n " an all-enveloping,
rubber skin," " M r . Unisphere 1965 "
and, for after the event, get " K-line."
The finale—Phil Marshall " This is
Your Life "—plotted the wet and
messy progress of this " product of a
miscarriage " from his early days as a
seducer of nurses through his educa-
tion at Eton (which he left having had
a fag) and his experience i n the
Pioneer Corps (from which he was
cashiered) to his first Glory at Guilds
Everybody left the meeting feeling
once again that Guilds is the greatest.
Though more subdued than previous
ones, a happy medium was struck be-
tween seriousness and farce.
