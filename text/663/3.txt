Mooncy
Grilled
A microwave oven is to be
installed behind the Lounge Bar
in the Union Building to extend
the range of food the bar serves.
The oven is initially on a three
month trial period since ' M r
Victor Mooney, Refectories
Manager, is sceptical about its
usefulness.
The instalation of the oven
follows pressure from the Union
through the Suggestions and
Complaints Committee. M r
Mooney's reluctance to install
the oven has caused a long delay
between the i d e a t i n g proposed
and its fruition. However, after a
good deal of persistence by
student reps on the refectory
committees, M r Mooney has
eventually had to agree to the
instalation for a trial period.
Graduates
Presented
University of London graduates
including IC graduates were
presented to the Vice-Chancellor
Professor Randolph Quirk C B E
at the Royal Albert Hall on
Wednesday.
During the colourful cere-
money, graduates filed across the
stage and bowed or curtsied to
the Vice-Chancellor, resplendent
in his black damask robe
trimmed with gold lace. Higher
doctors were hooded by Profes-
sor Quirk himself. The event was
attended by family and friends of
the graduates.
All University of London
graduates are invited to attend
such a presentation of which
there are three each year. They
are in addition to the College
cerimonies such as Imperial's
Commemoration Day presenta-
tion of Associates of the Consti-
tuent Colleges.
New
Publication
A new College publication had its
first issue last Friday. 'Fido' was
produced and written by
members of the College staff,
with the approval of the Rector.
It is expected that 'Fido' will
appear about three times a term,
replacing the demised 'Topic'.
I C U S l a m s U G C
The Union has surpassed itself in
responding to the College's call
for submission on the U G C
questionnaire on education cuts.
No less than two separate
responses have been given to
College, one written by Union
President Gaynor Lewis and the
other by External Affairs Officer
Peter Burt. It was felt that the
reports were so different in style,
despite expressing similar views,
that they could not be merged.
The U G C has written to all
Vice-Chancellors and Principals
asking for their views on how
their institution will change in the
next five years assuming constant
student numbers, either with or
without a cut in the resources per
student. The College will be
formulating a response after
submissions from departments
and other bodies in College have
been considered by the Board of
Studies.
•The U G C letter also asks for
views on how higher education
should cope with the expected
drop in student numbers of 15 to
20% between 1990 and 1995.
Altogether there are 28 questions
covering all aspects of the future
of higher education. The later
questions are intended to pro-
voke debate and the College is
not intending to formally
respond to them. However the
Union responses address them-
selves to the whole series of
questions.
It is not widely believed that
the Union's comments will be
taken too seriously since they
restrict themselves to generalisa-
tions and idealistic rhetoric
rather than directly answering
the UGC's questions. Miss Lewis
in particular appears to com-
pletely miss the point of at least
one of the questions, and often
her 'answers' seem to have little
relevance to the corresponding
question, in the opinion of a
number of people who have read
her report.
A mini Rag week planned last
term will go ahead in the second
week of March despite problems
in obtaining street collection
licences.
It was thought that the week
would not go ahead after it was
discovered that the applications
for collecting licences had been
s u b m i t t e d too late. R a g
Chairman James Benbow has
however obtained the permisson
of Q E C and Chelsea College to
collect on their licences on the 9th
and 10th of March. Although
details of events for the week
have not been finalised plans are
well under way and will be
announced in the near future.
Meanwhile the Royal College
of Science Union have put Rag
stunts back on a firm footing this
year with 25 students hobbling
around South Kensington raising
over £50 for Rag on their three-
legged pub crawl.
Things were running smoothly
until a group of five first years (on
a six legged crawl) got legless and
fell out of step, collapsing in a
large pile on Exhibition Road.
Cancer
Clues
1
A n IC research team has made a
major breakthrough in under-
t standing how cancer starts. The
| team from the biochemistry
department, headed by D r Peter
Rigby, has found that a set of
genes (called 'set 1' genes) that
are active in tumour cells are
also active in normal embryo
cells.
This result is thought to be of
fundamental importance in can-
cer research, although 'for
reasons which are not immedi-
ately obvious', according to
Nature. Rigby's experiment
began by treating cultured mouse
cells with a tumoui-forming virus
and then comparing the genetic
activity with untreated cells.
It is thought that the repeated
pattern of 'set 1' genes in D N A
may be responsible for de-
regulating the genetic activity in
tumours. The idea is to be tested
by performing similar experi-
ment on other tissues.
For
Gods Sake
G O !
Colleges of Further Education
are now taking control of the
National Union of Students
according to aij IC student who
attended the recent N U S con-
ference. John Passmore, Council
Chairman and former I C U Presi-
dent, attended the N U S
conference as a U L U observer.
At last Monday's Council meet-
ing he reported that whereas in
the past political groupings had
been able to dominate N U S , at
this conference the colleges of
Further Education were able to
organise themselves into a united
voting block.
The F E colleges have long felt
that the N U S has ignored their
demands. In particular N U S has
not been effective in campaigning
for better funding for student
unions in the F E colleges.
Council also had an extended
debate on F E L l X ' s performance
this session. LMssatisfaction was
expressed in a practical way when
Pallab Ghosh, F E L I X Editor,
failed to win a vote of confidence
by 15 votes to 11 in a secret ballot.
