MISADVENTURE VERDICT
CAUSE REMAINS MYSTERY
The inquest into the drowning of a
took place last Monday. A verdict
coroner on Christopher Darkes,
Engineering.
The hearing, at Westminster
Coroner's Court, failed to
discover the reason for the
drowning. The coroner was
mystified as to why Christopher,
who was an e x p e r i e n c e d
swimmer with knowledge of
swimming pool safety, should
have drowned. A n autopsy
carried out the f o l l o w i n g
morning did nothing to shed light
on the incident.
The only evidence pointing to
the time when he entered the pool
was given by a woman who was a
spectator to the Water Polo game
going on at the time. She saw
someone fitting Christopher's
student in the College swimming pool
of misadventure was returned by the
a first year student in Electrical
description enter the pool room
at 7:15pm. At 7:30pm the Water
Polo game started and no one
other than the players were in the
pool. It seems most probable that
Christopher entered the pool
about 7:15 and had drowned
before 7:30.
The purpose of a coroner's
hearing is to establish the cause of

raised by Christopher's father, to
which it was answered that since
it was a private club session this
was not required. Christopher Darkes

About Â£40 was stolen from one of
the pinball machines in the Union
Games Room last Wednesday by
a gang of teenagers who have
been responsible for a number of
thefts around College. The theft
was discovered after F E L I X
cartoonist Tim Noyce noticed
people acting suspiciously inside
the Games Room and found that
the door was locked. He alerted
F E L I X Editor Pallab Ghosh who
sent another staff member over
to the G a m e s R o o m to
investigate the situation. As he
approached the thieves dashed
past him and out of the
quadrangle. Tim Noyce saw them
run through Beit Arch from
inside the F E L I X Office and gave
chase, unfortunately losing them
in the graduation day crowds
near the Albert Hall.
If anyone sees a group of
teenagers acting suspiciously
around College they should in-
form security at once

On Wednesday a small film crew outside the Albert Hall steps
were filming a Cantonese feature film entitled 'Banana Cops'.
The film is a slapstick cops and robbers comedy about a
I London policeman chasing heroin smugglers who ends up
getting his brains blown out outside the Albert Hall.
