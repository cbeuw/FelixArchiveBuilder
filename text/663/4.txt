THIS WEEK'S
N U M B E R
DRAUGHTS
It seems you found last week's problem rather
difficult, as there was only one correct solution.
Remember that you must take every piece you
can. As long as you force your opponent to take
your pieces, he cannot develop a strategy. The
trick is to be left with one piece which can capture
all the opposing pieces in one move. This is
beautifully demonstrated in last week's solution:
Black: 12, 14, 25; Kings: 15, 19. White: 8, 11,
29; Kings: 1, 22. White to move and win.
Soln. 8-4, 15-8, 4-11, 25-30, 1-5A, 30-25, 22-26
25-21, 11-16, 19-24, 29-25, 12-19, 5-9, 21-23,
9-20, white wins (see for yourself). If the
move at A was 1-6 then 30-25, 22-26, 14-18
results in a draw. Author - Joe Charles.
