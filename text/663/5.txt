2. STRETCHING YOUR STUDENT GRANT
Undergraduate Grants
Most people who have been'
'ordinarily resident' in the U K for
three years are entitled to a
mandatory award for their first
degree course. This is paid by
local education authorities, and
covers tuition fees and an element
towards the student's mainten-
ance (currently £1,975 i n
London). 'Reasonable' travel
costs above £50, covering daily
travel into College and three
return journeys to your parental
home, can at present also be
reclaimed. (You should check
just how reasonable your L E A
are prepared to be in reimbursing
these expenses).
The sum paid by your L E A can
be less than the full £1,975,
principally because many parents
are expected to contribute to the
grant their children receive. U n -
less you are 25 or over or have
been supporting yourself on yffur
own earnings for at least three
years, your parents income will
be assessed to determine this
contribution. The student's own
income is also assessed and any
term time income above £375 per
year is deducted pound for pound
from your grant. Any scholarship
income above £540 (£795 for
National Engineering scholar-
ships) again results in pound for
pound deductions from the
grant.
Your L E A may also give you
an extra maintenance allowance,
principally if you are a mature
student or have dependents or
special needs. Be sure to check
that you are receiving your full
entitlement.
Covenants for Students
If your parents contribute a sum
to your grant they may be able to
ease the financial burden by
covenanting it.
A covenant is a legally binding
agreement under which one
person promises to make a series
of payments to another. Making
a covenant of the parental
contribution will enable a student
to claim back the basic rae of tax
the parent has already paid on the
contribution.
For example, normally on
earnings of £100 a taxpayer
would pay £30 leaving £70. B y
using a covenant your parents
give you the £70 and the taxman
will give you the £30 that they
have already paid.
This arrangement works only
if:
1) the parent pays tax and the

old or married.
Use of a covenant means that
the student will have to pay tax
on his/her own income once the
personal tax allowance, which is
curently £1,785, is exceeded. Y o u
must therefore make sure that
your total income (covenant and
vacation earnings and taxable
benefits and investment income
etc) in a tax year does not exceed

A covenant can be drawn up at
any time of year or at any point in
your cojirse, but they cannot be
backdated. The sooner it is done
the more you will benefit.

rate.
2. The covenant is then sealed
•with a red seal.
3. Date and sign the covenant.
This should be witnessed but not
by the beneficiary and preferably
not by a parent. Keep copies for
the parent, student and taxman.

Deed of Covenant
I, Edward Smith, of 16 Moon Street, Blackburn, covenant to
pay my son, William Smith, of the same address, a gross
amount of £116.67 on each of the following dates in each year,
namely 1 October, 1 January, 1 April, for the period of seven
years, or for the period of our joint lives, or until he ceases to be
receiving full-time education at any university, college, school
or other education establishment (whichever is the shortest
period), the first payment to be made on 1 October 1983.
|Dated 1 September 1983
Signed, sealed and delivered by Edward Smith
in the presence of
(witness' signature and address)
How to go about covenanting
1. Write out a deed o f
covenant using the above word-
ing.
Note that covenants should be
| said to run for a period of seven
years. The covenant can be
abandoned before then, but there
4 must be no prior intention to do
this.
If you want to change the
amounts of money covenanted,
the original deed can be torn up
and a new one made out, with the
agreement of the student, i n
writing.
It is advisable to use payment
dates which fall only in term time,
B i m H H H ^ r M g ^ 20 January, 1984
jas the authorities may otherwise
I include covenant payments as
,part of your vacation income if
you apply for vacation benefits.
The wording used in the
i example means that if you are to
receive a constant overall sum,
your parents will have to alter the
amount that they give you every
time the basic rate of tax changes,
as they have agreed to pay a
'gross' amount to you. It is also
possible to agree to pay 'an
amount, which after deduction of
tax at the basic rate, amounts to
£...'. This means that they pay a
constant amount, but the refund
the student gets from the taxman
amount on the dates stated on the
covenant. The first payment must
not be before the date on which
the covenant was signed.
4. The parent gets a copy o f
form 1R 185 (AP) from the tax
office and completes it. The
completed form is returned to the
student's tax office, or the nearest
if s/he does not have one (look in
the phone book under 'Inland
Revenue'). A copy o f the
covenant should be included with
the first claim.
5. The student then completes
claim form " R40 and, i f the
taxman is satisfied, will be
reimbursed at the end of the tax
year.
Covenants can also be drawrt
up between, say, you and your
graduates or brothers, sisters etc.
In such cases the recipient does
not have to be under 18, although
he must not be earning money.
nb—This procedure differs in
Scotland. The Inland Revenue
produce a form IR47 with
specimen covenants and brief
details on their use, including
Scottish details. They will not,
however, answer any detailed
questions y o u may have.
However, Student Services will
be able to assist, and please feel
free to consult them on such
matters.
