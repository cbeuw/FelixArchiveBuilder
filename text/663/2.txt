Inter-Hall
Rag
Dear Pallab
As a person who has been
actively involved in the Guilds
Union since my first week at
Imperial onwards, I feel that I
must try to offer some explana-
tion to the rather unrepre-
sentative article 'CCUs Slated'
in last week's F E L I X .
The C C U s are in my opinion
the best social groups in College
and without the enthusiasm of
the C C U hacks IC Rag would
be a lot worse off, if in existence
at all.
Needless to say the quote of
'ineffective organisations' was
not referring to the CCUs on
the whole. Unfortunately very
few people identify themselves
with their C C U enough to turn
out on collections to ensure that
the C C U of which they are a
member has the highest Rag
total. The statement was refer-
ring to this, and arose when I
was suggesting that we should
encourage competition between
additional units such as Halls
and Houses on our next collec-
tion licence.
Yours

Dear Sir
It seems appropriate enough
that our very own IC 'Big
Brother' should choose this
particular time to reveal him-
self. I am of course referring to
the rantings of F E L I X Sports
Page Editor John Scott in last
week's issue. In case you didn't
notice, the esteemed badminton
superstar has decreed that any
future sports reports not corn-
forming to his four-point recipe
for compositional nirvana will
be discarded. Although M r
Scott's own lengthy articles for
the Badminton Club achieve
widespread admiration I'm sure
there are many other contri-
butors who feel patronised, as I
do, by his suggestion that we
read the Daily Mirror (!) to see
how sports reports should
really be written.
Joking aside it must be said
that John is only trying to do his
job in attempting to achieve
wider readership for individual
clubs' articles. The road to this
end however surely lies in

Admittedly few people want
to be presented every week with
self-indulgent garbage full of in-

stories. Even so it should be
possible for F E L I X to produce
a readable Sports Page without
recourse to this kind of dicta-
torial circumscription.

Dear Pallab
I was shocked by the revela-
tion in Ken Weale's letter last
week that you had been sent on
a typing course at a cost to the
Union of £96. Having seen your
pitiful attempts at typing I have
grave doubts that this was
money well spent. Either the
course was extremely poor or
you were not paying attention
in class. I think we should
demand our money back.
Yours etc

Loony
Lefties
Dear Pallab
In reply to Jonathan
Gerson's letter in the Christmas
edition of F E L I X , I feel I must
set the record straight con-
cerning myself, the Liberal
Club and the loony lefties.
As was pointed out by M r
Gerson, I wrote a letter to
IIIIIPMIIIIlllHIll—I Friday, 20
Private Eye about a visit by M r
Michael Meadowcroft, a
Liberal M P . to IC. saying what
an embarassingh smaii audi-
ence he had. This may seem a
rather below the belt thing to
do. but M r Meadowcroft, in-
stead of speaking on what he'd
supposedly come to IC to talk
about, waffled on for three
quarters of an hour about
himself, his constituency, and
HIS political views—in short he
blew his own trumpet, an act
usually associated with MPs in
the present conservative admin-
istration.
Concerning the loony letties,
well it is totally inexpedient to
class people such as myself as
being in this category (as was
implied by M r Gerson). On the
contrary; I consider myself to
be somewhat conservative in
my views and so do various
SDP friends of mine, but are all
agree that good old Macmillan-
ite conservatism is one thing,
whilst oppressive, intransigent
Thatcherism is another, and
just because we Liberal/SDP-
ites have the guts to speak out
against our leaders when we
disagree with them

Fremantle
Misery
Dear Editor
I'm a first year, but I like to
consider myself educated in the
way of the world, and quite
frankly, I am disgusted.
I was led to believe that student
life was a happy time. M y stay at
the now infamous Fremantle
Hotel has been a positive misery.
This is mainly due to the lack
of consideration and gross mis-
management displayed by the
newly appointed Warden. War-
den indeed!
For example, he neglected to
do anything about the fact that
January. 1984 WMRWWBBMHBBM
| : f r e e z e r s had broken
Uowii. uu.v • unnecessarily
causing several hundred ;.• mid-
•vonh i«t*T.>oJ to pen':!.
Tin... anotner time when a
nip. burst in tiis.- room above me
and water cascaded in ton ents
over my bookcase, ruining a
term's notes, noi only was he
drunk at the time, he seemed to
treat the whole matter as a joke,'
quoate 'They're your notes,
sonny'
Nothing was done until the
new subwarden moved in.
Within two hours of his
arrival. I had been offered a new
room, and the plumber had been
calleds in to deal with the leak.
These are but two examples of
M; James' stupidity and uiisuif-
abilitv for the ior>.
We appear to have icplai '<! ar
unknown with an incompetent.

Dear Gaynor
Further to my letter of last
term. 1 regret to inform you that
the 'baked bean' situation has
not improved in the Union
Lower Refectory.
As is my wont on Viondays I
today obtained my customary
portion of chips, sausage and
baked beans. Once again the
baked beans were stone cold.
It seems to me inconceivable
that w ith the vast resources and
huge staff of the refectories it is
impossible to prepare correctly
so simple a dish as baked beans.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Rowe
I was sorry to see by your
letter of 9 January, addressed to
Ciaynor Lewis. President of IC
Union, that the baked beans
situation has not improved in
the Union Lower Refectory.
I have today instructed my
deputy to install a small electric
hotplate, solely for the purpose
of heating baked beans, and
trust that this will improve the
situation. In the meantime, I
would ask you to accept my
apologies for our shortcomings.
Yours sincerely
V J Mooney
Refectory Manager
