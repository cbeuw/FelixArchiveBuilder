N ILEA

Simon Neild.
1. Government proposals to cut the budget of the Inner London Education
Authority by £12Cm in the coming year, and plans to remove the right of
Londoners to directly elect representatives to the Authority.
2. The National Day of Action on 24th January in support of the ILEA.
ICU Believes:
1. Adequate state funding is essential if educational standards are to be
maintained and if there is to be open access to education.
2. Oats in the rate support grant and new "rate capping" proposals will lead
to a serious underfunding of LEA's which will in turn lead to a decreased
quality of education.
3. The higher costs and particular social conditions found in inner London
mean that education here will be more expensive than otherwise.
4. Cuts in discretionary awards to ILEA students and underfunding of the 3
6
Polytechnics, Further Education and specialist Colleges assisted by the
ILEA would result from Government expenditure proposals. Higher education
as a service to the whole of London will therefore w
e wrecked.
