Ents off Freebics on
Council got off to a flying start on
Monday when Union Adminis-
trator Mrs Hardy-Smith had the
misfortune to fall under a black-
board. Christine Teller rushed
to her aid and was just able to
make out a hoarse whisper giving
the combination for the Union
Sherry Safe. Medicinal Tio Pepe
was administered and the real
business of the day could begin.
Concern was expressed that the
Ents Committee lost £1,500 on
the Christmas party at the end of
last term. The party featured
several bands, a bar extension,
disco, etc, but was badly
publicised resulting in a disaster-
ously low turn-out for the event.
Some Council members expressed
dissatisfaction about the general
running of Ents and the type of
events organised. It was decided
that Ents should not book any
further events until their affairs
had been investigated by Steve
Bishop, an Ordinary Member of
Council.
Council also considered the
Rodgers Report on Conferences.
The motion on the N U S con-
ference passed at a U G M last
term set up a committee to
investigate expenditure on con-
ferences by I C U . Only three
members of the eight member
committee bothered to turn up,
probably because the proposers
of the U G M motion had not
checked that they were actually
prepared to take part. In the
event the committee recom-
mended that I C U should
continue to send people to ten
conferences connected with
student union affairs, and should
send observers to the next N U S
conference. In considering
I N C O S T , the International
Conference of Students in
Science and Technology, to be
held this year in Helsinki from 1
to 7 A p r the committee made
no reco: "Nation due to
' i n s u f f i c i e n t . c r e a t i o n ' .
Council decided to send two
delegates this year to the
conference, Guilds academic
affairs officer Jim Boucher, and
Steve Bishop. The return airfare
to Helsinki (economy ticket) is
£155 per person.
Southsidc
Security
It was revealed this week that
electronic locks will be fitted to
the entrances of the Southside
Halls of Residence by the start of
next term. A l l residents will be
issued with magnetic cards and a
code number to allow them
access to the Halls during the
night when the doors are locked.
It is hoped that this will tighten
up security in the building in the
light of recent thefts in Southside.
Profs
Pledge
A number of academic staff have
signed a 'peace pledge' stating
that they will never directly u?e
their technical and scientific skills
for the furtherance of the nuclear
arms lace. At a meeting in
College last Thursday eight
members of staff including Prof
Kibble, head of the Physics
department, signed the pledge
and explained their reasons for
doing so in front of an audience
of about fifty students.
New Pro for IC
Imperial College is to have a new
Pro Rector, External Develop-
ment. Professor Charles Phelps,
currently Principal of Chelsea
College, has accepted the new
appointment.
His main responsibility will be
liason between IC and industry,
and the promotion of research
capabilities.
Prof Phelps became top man at
Chelsea in 1981, straight from a
career in Academia. He set up the
department of Biochemistry at
Lancaster in 1975 where he was
responsible for research grants
worth nearly £100 000.
Born in Buenos Aires in 1934,
Phelps graduated with a first in
Biochemistry from Oxford in
1957. He went on to gain a
DPhil from the same University
and then moved to Bristol as a
lecturer until 1975.
His job as principal of Chelsea
College is to disappear when the
controversial amalgamation with
Kings and Q E C takes place, later
this year. Prof Phelps, who is
married with two children,
expects to take up his new
appointment towards the end of
1984. ,
Election loophole plugged
F i n d another way to cheat!
Elections committee have
decided that printing of all
publicity for the forthcoming
sabbatical elections is to be
restricted to the F E L I X Office
and that Gestetnering may only
be done in the Union Office. The
F E L I X Editor and the Hon Sec
must be informed if Sherfield
facilities are to be used. Any
other printing facility, within or
outside College may not be used,
since it is felt that access to such
facilities often depends on
personal contact and may give an
unfair advantage to a candidate.
It is understood that one of the
candidates has appealed against
the ruling and that elections
committee will be meeting to
reconsider their decision.

'A United Ireland is the only solution'
Clive So/ey
FELIX OTB
At Debsoc's Tuesday debate on
Northern Ireland the motion
'This house believes that a United
Ireland is the only solution' was
carried by sixteen votes. This
result surprised many as it
contrasts with the largely right
wing political outlook of many
IC students.
Proposing the motion, M r
Clive Soley Labour M P spoke of
the 'illegally drawn' border be-
tween Northern and Southern
Ireland, and of its disastrous
failure e c o n o m i c a l l y • and
politically. Created to preserve a
Unionist majority, the boundary
had produced a split community
in Northern Ireland. Most of the
population considered them-
selves to be linked with Britain,
but a third of them claimed
allegiance with Eire, he said.
The motion was opposed by
Sir J o h n B i g g s - D a v i d s o n ,
Conservative M P , who argued
that the division of Ireland was
more than a matter of religious or
national allegiance. Ulster, he
said, was historically separate,
and a distinct community had
arisen there which had always
had close links with Scotland and
Northern England.
