Union
The general information on page 3
is the current situation as far as the
recent policy statement issued by
J o h n S m i t h the C o l l e g e
Secretary, with regard to the
m a n a g e m e n t o f s t u d e n t
residences. A number of queries
have already been raised by the
Union and other interested
parties, and the new policy docu-
ment featured predominantly in
F E L I X last week.
I feel the College concern with
student staff relations is a valid
point and indeed an attempt to
rectify the situation is occuring
through a number of different
means. I do not feel the situation
would be dramatically improved
by the introduction of academic
staff into the penthouse flats in
Southside. Neither can I see this
causing a vast improvement in
the relationship the College has
with the South'side Mews
residents. The idea of Wardens of
other residences residing in
Southside is ludicrous, especially
if the new roles are implemented.
How can a warden exercise
pastoral care over students if s/he
resides possibly a mile from the
residence under their care! The
present system of only two
wardens in Southside means a
high level of responsibility is
imposed on the Southside
wardens but I believe a more
efficient use of the subwardens
and assistant subwardens in
Southside Halls and even
Linstead would alleviate much of
-the pressure and responsibility,
and thus make the increase in the
number of Wardens a futile exer-
cise.
The Staff Warden at Evelyn
Gardens may have many advan-
tages though the reasoning
behind the introduction of the
post it pressures f r o m
neighbours, departmental tutors
and others, is dubious.
An improved control of the
maintenance and quality of all
residences is welcomed, although
whether the proposed relation-
ship between the new Manager,
Housekeepers and Wardens will
function in practice is yet to be
established. I feel a number of
problems are likely to arise in this
area, but this is probably true of
any new system in its initial
stages.
A major concern for students
in future years must obviously be
the financial undertakings in the
policy. The objective of achieving
a rent income which will
c o m p l e t e l y s u p p o r t the
maintenance of the basic stock of
residence, i n c l u d i n g loan
servicing and management costs,
leaves the future rent levels in a
very u n c e r t a i n s i t u a t i o n ,
although certain subsidies may
be permitted from time to time
under the University Grants
Committee rules.
It is extremely unlikely that the
increased financial burden on the
residence account will enable
College to maintain an increase
in student rents in line with the
increase in the student grants; the
final implication being that
students will suffer from the re-
organisation of the 'Managment
of student residence' if such
policies are implemented. The
recent statement issued by
College will be under discussion
at an Open Meeting with John
Smith, the College Secretary, in
the Read Lecture Theatre,
Sherfield Building at 1:30pm on
Thursday 23 February 1984. Do
you care about the rent you pay?
Do you care about the standard
of your residence? Then come to
the meeting—make your views
known and speak on behalf of the
students! Anyone wishing to read
the policy ' document before
Thursday is welcome to read the
copy in the Union Office.
