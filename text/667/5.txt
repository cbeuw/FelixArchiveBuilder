OF
Breakfast time was always a difficult time
for the Baron. As he sipped his strong,
black coffee, with his head buried in one
of the many newspapers he read as an
excuse not to listen to Lady Marigold's
perpetual chatter, his face darkened.
For Lady Marigold's prattling was
nothing compared to what stared him in
the face: 'SKATE SEX S C A N D A L . 'Oh
damn—this is just what I could do with-
out,' he moaned.
Gormless Layon, President of the
Citizens Association, had also seen
something she could well do without:
Michael Missile, the sex-crazed ego-
maniac and self-publicist and the cause
of the Baron's displeasure. For it was he
who revealed details of some of the lude
e n t e r t a i n m e n t s p r o v i d e d for
Cheapskate's citizens in order to keep
them happy despite the unusual condi-
tions which prevailed in the kingdom.
Michael had entered the Citizens Office,
sporting his now permanent blush and
carrying a few tatty posters advertising
his latest crack-pot ideas.
'Have any more newspapers tele-
pr oned?' he asked.
'No,' replied Gormless as she sulkily
retreated to her office, slamming the
door behind her.
Somewhat disappointed, Michael
announced to the now empty room:
'I do like The Daily Smut—it gives
really fair coverage that is always so
balanced.' And having checked that
there was no fan mail for him, he strode
out of the office and nearly knocked over
FELIX m m a m m m m m m a a a a m a a m m
Jo Claybrain, an obscure citizen's
representative who spent so much time
in the office. Pushing Michael aside with
the physique for which she was noted
she strode into the office. She, too, was
upset by Michael's activities.
'What right has he got to go around
upsetting the status quo like that?' she
thought. 'Poor Gormless must be so
upset by all those calls—I had better go
and console her.'
Armed with an excuse, Jo bounced
into Gormless' office only to find it
empty with Gormless talking to Pristine
next door.
'Oh goodie,' she cried. 'Since she's not
here I can get in some practise.' So Jo sat
down in the chair, whose ability to rotate
was a source of so much delight to her,
and began to play with the telephones.
'I'll soon have all this to myself,' she
thought, planning her campaign for
some years hence. But 'I'll have to stay in
with the self-appointed President-elect,
though. Maybe I'll give him the odd
c u d d l e - t h a t ' l l k e e p h i m h a p p y . '
However upon hearing G o r m l e s s '
voice, she thought better of the idea.
'Jo, I am V E R Y busy today,' said
Gormless firmly. 'There are so many
problems and I'm not feeling too well so
can you PLEASE get out of my chair.' Jo
sheepishly left the office, sulking and
went to sit in her namesake's—Jo
Henawhatshername's—chair which
swivelled too. And hardly had she sat
down when the office door burst open
revealing Sawnoff Levis and the citizens
chief transvestite, Mike Dress. Panting
heavily, Sawnoff shouted:
'Der konhim's boin invoided.'
Everyone stared. 'Pardon,' said
Gormless.
'Cheapskate's been invaded by
Jerkskate. Buildings have been
attacked, treasure stolen...rape, pillage
and plunder,' cried Mike Dress, as if
happy at such a prospect.
Jo Claybrain was only just quick
enough to grab Gormless before she fell
on the floor.
'Get some smelling salts...and a stiff
sherry!'
Is there anyone who Michael Missile
hasn't telephoned?
Will the Baron negotiate on
sovereignty?
The answers to this and more in the
next Baron of Cheapskate.

BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS
7. Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith,
Union Administrator
Jen is head of the Union permanent staff
and responsible to the Union Executive.
Thus her position is analagous to
another JHS, John Hilary Smith, who is
responsible to Governing Body for
College Admin. Her previous jobs have
included spells as an assistant to a
society photographer, at the Iraqui
Embassy, and as a departmental secre-
tary at Ealing College. She began work
at IC in what is now the FELIX print
room sometime in 1973. She has given
the Union continuity and a means by
which past and present sabbaticals can
exchange intelligence. She is recognised
as one of the formidable woman of IC
once telling John Smith 'If you are going
to behave like that you're not going to
get a cup of coffee', in a rare moment of
pique. Her image is as one of the staff of
St Trinians ever shouting 'Jolly hockey-
sticks' as she 'bullys orf.
She has worked with 34 sabbatical
officers and ten of 'those FELIX boys'.
But, stiffened by chilled dry sherry (her
only weakness apart from good living)
she has endured numerous crackpot
schemes and financial disasters.
A sketch of Jen would be incomplete
without mentioning Pat Baker, the
Union Typist, who is the ideal foil for Jen
with her more abrupt Scottish wit.
All in all, I raise my glass with palsied
hand in salute with the cry semper
bibendum sherry to this true heiress of
Amelia Fritten.
