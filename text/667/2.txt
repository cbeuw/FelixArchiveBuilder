Bullshit
5Dear Pallab
With response to M r Lock's
letter in last week's F E L I X
(Issue 666). I fail to see just what
is either 'ranting' or 'hilarious'
about my factual correction to a
completely unbalanced and in-
accurate report in London
Student. To my knowledge, I
have never met the gentleman in
question; either formally or
socially, and cannot imagine
what I have done to annoy him.
I can only suggest that he either
objects to my slagging off of the
general apathy in RCS or
dislikes me personally. In either
case, I would appreciate his
opinions on these matters face-
to-face as opposed to from a
distance.
Mr Lock seems to regard the
word 'hack' as an insult. In my
experience at IC, this expres-
sion is used by apathetic non-
entities to describe people who
can actually be bothered to get
involved with the Unions. I feel
proud to regard myself as an
active member of the Union and
if he feels this is a bad thing,
then that's his loss!
Yours sincerely

Broadsheet Editor 1983/4
Dear Pallab
Having just read a quite
unwarranted personal attack by
Dave Lock on Simon Banton
and the CCUs (FELIX 666), I
feel obliged to make some sort
of reply.
Simon's letter to London
Student was nothing more than
an attempt to set the record
straight after a remarkably
inaccurate report on the hand-
over of Mary. He does not
'rant', but clearly states facts;
and far from suggesting that he
is a 'moron', the letter shows
that he cares about factual
reporting—an ethic of journal-
ism. I would suggest that, had
M r Lock's letter, for instance,
been rewritten by the F E L I X
staff to misrepresent him, he
may have had something to say
about it.
On the more general points of
M r Lock's letter: he refers to
' C C U hacks'. As I understand
it, the word 'hack' is quite
simply an insult hurled by
people who are not prepared to
contribute anything them-
selves. I should like to know
whether M r Lock ever reads
Broadsheet. In my three years
mi

experience of R C S U , I would
say without doubt, that Brod-
sheet has never been better than
at present under Simon's
editorship, and .that its
popularity has not been higher.
To achieve this, Simon must
work for hours and hours every
fornight to prepare each issue.
The C C U structure exists at
Imperial College, to provide
informal, social student groups.
It will only work (and work
well) if people take part in the
Rag stunts and Ents trips
which are organised. Pre-
sumably, M r Lock believes that
these are also a waste of
time—and it is this attitude
which make Imperial College
such a boring place. If he isn't
satisfied with the way the CCUs
are run, why doesn't he come to
a U G M to express his opinions.
He is a member of RCS Union
whether he likes it or not!
Finally, mascotry is in fact a
Rag event—Rag involves
students raising money for
charity. A violated mascot is
ransomed to the owners, the
money being paid to charity.
Over the last few years,
successful mascotry raids by
R C S U have resulted in over
£1,000 (one thousand pounds!)
being paid to various charities.
Does M r Lock agree with
money-raising for charity—or
does he regard this also as 'the
epitome of mindlessness'?
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
I was appalled by last week's
letter from M r Lock concerning
mascotry. He strikes me as
being just another frustrated
freshman who has been rejected
by his peers and retaliates in the
only way he knows how,
through his vitriolic pen.
What M r Lock regards as a
'ranting letter on mascotry',
appears to me to be a succinct
letter itemising objectively re-
cent RCS mascotry activities. I
suggest that if M r Lock has to
resort to such delightful phrases
as 'kissing each others arses'
and tired old cliches like ' C C U
hacks', then he is the only
'moron' in the neighbourhood.
Yours sincerely

£5 increase
in rents
Dear Pallab
I was somewhat dismayed to
see in F E L I X 666 that the
Lauwerys residence report is
raising its ugly head again, in
the form of the appointment of
a Residential Services Manager
(albeit under another name). As
this was extensively discussed
last year, I would like to bring
up a few points raised then:
The Residential Services
Manager was intended to
streamline the running^ of
residences by, for instance,
inserting an extra administra-
tive layer between residents and
Estates ( m a k i n g repairs
p r o s p e c t i v e l y even less
efficient?), reducing even
further the work specification
of the housekeepers (who are
already overqualified and doing
tasks much more mundane than
their skills merit) and reducing
the role of wardens to a purely
pastoral one (though what
would happen if you have a
problem outside the hours 9-5 I
can't imagine).
A l l this was ( r a t h e r
tenuously) justified as self
financing if two further
wardens were shed and their
flats let to students, and that
reduced inefficiency would save
further money.
May I, perhaps, suggest what
I consider to be the real reasons
behind the appointment of a
Residential Services Manager.
Part of the job description is to
identify direct costs of
residence. This suggests that a
huge burden of costs are shortly
to be dumped on hall bills (a
back of envelope calculation
last year suggested at least £5
per room per week), pricing
residence rooms so far above
the means of the students that
we'll surely see increased
hardship^.
It seems College is bent on
producing another monolith
like refectories where students
have to pay for a system which
I Friday, February 17, 1984 j
does not offer what they want,
but over which they have no
control.
I could also mention the 'jobs
for the boys' aspect, but I think
that's so obvious that it hardly
merits space!
In closing I can only say:
' W H A T T H E H E L L IS IC
U N I O N D O I N G A B O U T IT?'
Are we going to see more
crawling to College by ever-so-
pretty but totally ineffectual Ms
Lewis? This problem is
important and its up to your
readers to get up and complain
before it's too late.

Cow
Racks
Dear Sir
Regarding the red cycle racks
and the Southside fridges
( F E L I X 665).
Since the racks are non-
inflammable, can I suggest that
the racks are placed on the
Southside landings. Residents
can then tether cows to them,
r e m o v i n g the need for
refigerated milk.
The redundant fridges can
then be placed on the Sherfield
Walkway, for use as cycle
'moorings'.
This will also give passing
U C L students somewhere to
cool off.

No Newman
Dear Pallab
I was dismayed to see that
last week you again devoted a
page to the immature rantings
of the by now infamous Michael
Newman. The article is headed
'Write of Reply', but what
exactly he is replying to is
unclear. In fact he has simply
been allowed further space to
promulgate his views, whilst
those who disagree with his
opinions and/or methods have
not had their views featured at
all, and certainly not in F E L I X .
M r Newman claims he is a
potential rapist so perhaps he
should be locked up for the
safety of women at IC. If he has
sexual hang-ups after an all
boys school education that's
too bad, what makes him (and
you) think the rest of us want to
read about them nearly every
week in FELIX?
Yours etc
