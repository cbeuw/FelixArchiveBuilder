Camborne Weekend
Sport
by Tim Williams
Last weekend saw the annual ritual of the
Bottle Match Weekend—the most sacred
event in the R S M calendar. Nearly a quarter
of the student strength of R S M made the epic
pilgrimmage to Cornwall in a fleet of coaches,
the journey of a lifetime, an event for all the
family.
It is traditional for the squash team to pave
the way to victory by blowing their match and
our brave sacrificial lambs were duly
slaughtered half an hour off the coaches. In
two thrilling fourth and fifth strings
(threads?) matches we gloriously snatched a
single point to their fifty four. The thirds and
seconds put up stiffer resistence but the tour
de force was reserved for our first string
(rope?) who went down in the fifth game tie
break.
Now it was the turn of the ladies, in the
Camborne club bar. Provoked beyond en-
durance by the ungentlemanly conduct of the
President of Camborne School of Mines, one
of our female supporters feinted with the
left, ducked and weaved and went in with a
powerful one two combination. At the bell
R S M took the bout by a knockout and a
submission; C S M could only respond with a
banning order from the bar. The crowd loved
it. When the news of the insult to our honour
was flashed to the rugby team hotel, there
were ugly scenes.
Saturday morning saw the R S M hockey
club in action, continuing a match that had
started the night before in the pubs of
Camborne. The hangovers were largely
forgotten as we took to the field with the local
bookies quoting even money. The unfamiliar-
ity of the all-weather pitch caused many
problems for the R S M defence with C S M
making rapid breaks to test our goalie. Even
intense R S M pressure had failed to bend the
The Bottle in the Union Bar
rigging by half time but early in the second
C S M broke away to score despite the gallant,
nay heroic, efforts of the defence. R S M were
robbed minutes later by the umpire's
misinterpretation of the rule book when we
were awarded a short corner for a penalty
flick offence, and again later when their
keeper blatantly sat on the ball in the D . Is
there no justice—we finished second at the
final whistle. The R S M soccer team were next
to take the field to defend the cup we won last
year. On a pitch sited on the side of a
mountain, and in a howling gale, conditions
were not good. We elected to play towards the
summit in the second half and during the
course of a gritty and hard fought game put
the ball in the net twice, but, oh shit-once it
was our own goal.
And then to the Bottle Match. This is the
second most venerable varsity match in the
calendar and it seemed that half of Cornwall
turned out to watch—not an inch of touchline
to spare. But R S M supporters, outnumbered
and surrounded by opposition kept up a
steady roar of vocal barrage throughout the
game to pound the defenders.
The match started at a muscle cracking
pace and it was clear that this was to be the
survival of the fittest. The R S M pack held
together well under heavy pressure until the
breakthrough came with a brilliantly inter-
cepted pass by the R S M wing threequarter
who never looked like being caught as he ran
seventy metres to score by the posts. The full
back Kevin Douglas had a magnificent game
and converted the try with ease, only to
produce a superb individual try himself
before half time with a catch on the R S M 22, a
wearing run, a kick a head and chase to score
in the corner. Ten nil at half time and the
pressure was really on C S M to fight back into
the game.
They were worthy opponents and for ten
minutes attacked the R S M line ruthlessly but
solid defence kept them out and then a
beautifully worked back row move from the
pack had C S M groping as the backs went
over for another try. In the final minute, the
icing on the cake-a nicely worked move
down the backs and back again, deft passing
and solid support gave R S M a fourth try.
From the touchline Douglas booted it over
to leave us with a memorable twenty nil
victory. C S M played well and hard but never
capitalised on their penalties or made any
really exciting moves.
But this was above all a team effort, with
every man on the field at peak performance:
the hard work and dedication of the whole
club throughout the season had borne fruit.
Our pack held theirs soliily under pressure
and eventually dominated. They gave good
clean ball to the backs who never looked
stoppable. The tackling was effective and
fearless—altogether an excellent team at its
best. The match was televised and we hope to
get a copy of the video recording for public
exhibition.
So the bottle is back where it belongs in the
Union Bar, and if you thought R S M have
been noisy this year, you ain't seen nothing
yet.
