£19.45pw on rent and rates then
you are probably entitled to a
rent and rate rebate. Call into
Student Services N O W to find
out more about the scheme and
how to apply.
To those who read the article but
haven't yet applied for any benefit
Remember claims cannot be
backdated so you are losing
money by not applying. Amongst
those who applied last term are
students now receiving rebates of
up to £5pw so it is worth making
the effort. Student Services have
application forms for Kensington
& Chelsea, Hammersmith and
Fulham & Westminster. For all
other boroughs collect forms
from your local Town Hall.
To those who have already applied
Many of you will still have a long

breakdown of your assessment.
Then call into Student Services
and check the figures against our
Housing Benefit chart. If the
figures don't seem to tally then
appeal against the decision,
Student Services can help you
with this. The most important
point is not to delay—you have

•Whatever happened to the banana
housing benefit decision. If you
do not do so in writing within that
period then you lose your right of
appeal. Appealing costs you very
little time and a number of
decisions have been changed on
appeal so don't just assume that
your benefit has been correctly
assessed.
Gas & Electricity Charges
If your rent includes any gas or
electricity you would do well to
agree with your landlord the
charges in the rent for these.
Otherwise the Housing Benefit
Office may discount up to
£7.95pw from your rent thus
significantly lowering your
chances of any benefit. Figures
have recently been submitted to
Kensington & Chelsea concern-
ing gas and electricity figures for
6 Earls Court Square and the
Fremantle, and residents at these
addresses should write to
Kensington & Chelsea N O W
asking for a re-assessment.

If you live in a property which has
been 'fair rented', the housing
benefit office will only consider

more. To find out if you live in a
'fair rented' property call into

does have a fixed 'fair rent' you
may be able to claim some money
back from your landlord but this

from Student Services first.
