Science Fiction often follows such lines late onSaturday
evenings in front of the TV as the horror double bill plays
itself out. Others would identify such serials as Or Who
and Star Trek&s their childhood indoctrination into the
field. While not many people Would considerthemselves
as SF buffs there are few people who have not come into
contact with this most misrepresented field of art,
writing and social comment.

Unfortunately the literature has
suffered due to the miscon-
ception in the good old days that
to write science fiction you
needed to be a scientist rather!
than a writer. As a result SF
books used to contain one or two!
'interesting ideas' (like robots or
space travel or something
equally:as crass), a semblance of
a plot and some kind of message

thing really). Their contribution
to4h« literary field however was
absolutely zero.
A valiant attempt to break but
of (he confines of the traditional
structure of the 'novel' was made
by a group of young 'avant-
guar.de" SF authors during the
60s. Most notable among them
was Sam Deianey. Michael
Moorcock and Harlan Ellison,.

Even so, somethinq which
saves SF from ever reachinq the
depths of the Penguin Classics
Series is its sense of humour and
its ability to make fun of itself.
And this is, I believe, where the
power of the genre lies. Bill, the
Galactic Hero, by Aldiss, is
hilarious, but at the same time
makes a powerful point. It is
reality by deception and Douglas
