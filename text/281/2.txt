ASTMS Gets
Pay Increase
Last term the Imperial College branch of the Associa-
tion of Scientific Technical and Managerial Staffs took
part in a national one day strike and a further three day
Stoppage coinciding with Open Day. The A.S.T.M.S. claimed
a 10 per cent salary increase. They are now pleased to say
that they have gained a 7 per cent increase composed of
a 4.4 per cent interim increase and a further 2.6 per cent
part payment for any salary increase arising from a " job
evaluation exercise" to be run under the guidance of the
Manpower and Productivity Service of the Department of
Employment and Productivity.
The aim of the exercise is to produce a factual report
on the jobs that the universities technical staff actually do.
The exercise, taking place at Imperial College from October
13th to 17th, will be supervised by a college monitoring
committee consisting of two from I.C., two from A.S.T.M.S.,
and a chairman from the Manpower Services. In each
department there will be a committee of two—an A.S.T.M.S.
representative and the Head of Department. Each member
of the technical staff will be interviewed by one of 17 field
workers, composed of postgraduates from other colleges paid
a fee of £5 per day plus expenses. The interviews will last for
about an hour and a half and there will also be a confidential
questionnaire to fill in.
If the whole exercise is completed by April 1970 as hoped
for, it will be an outstanding achievement as similar
exercises in the motor industry have taken up to two years.
On completion negotiations for further salary increases will
start again, backdated incidentally to April 1969. Both the
college authorities and A.S.T.M.S. are confident of the
schemes' success.
The
Anatomy
of a
Student
On 12 October The Sunday Times
begins an eight week investigation
into higher education and careers.
It begins with a survey of 5,000
students; the higher education
they chose and why; the guidance
- a n d misguidance - they received,
and how they feel about it today.
It continues with a dissection
of 44 universities and 30
polytechnics: their strengths and
weaknesses, their courses and
conditions. The inside story on
careers that the glossy brochures
gloss over —from T V and foreign
service to management and
teaching. An exhaustive eight
part survey that asks the whys,
whats and hows - and answers
them. The Anatomy of a Student
is about how it is.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.
THE SUNDAY TIMES
Famous Anniversary Celebrated
The traditional two minute
darkness in memory of the
well-known RCS scientist, Dr
Spiggy Topes, was held at the
RCSU freshers Union meet-
ing last Thursday. Despite
the extreme thinness of the
excuse, the darkness was
accepted in silence (and dark-
ness) by the vast throng and
also by the large audience.
This revered period of ab-
stinence from light was just
one of the many totally irrev-
erent and irrelevant happen-
ings at the meeting. It was
followed by several amusing
sketches by well-known
RCSU personalities. As they
did not appear to need to use
a script, one must draw the
inescapable conclusion that
such behaviour is normal to
them ! The standard of the
fun side of the meeting was
considerably improved upon
last year.
Earlier on, the various
Union officials addressed the
packed lecture theatre and
explained to the freshers the
workings of RCSU and its
The first thing about the
organisation is that we are
not really a club or society.
We have no formal meetings,
except the Obligatory general
meetings, no entry fee, in
fact not really any members
—just helpers. At the mom-
ent, some would doubt that
we even have any organisa-
tion, as two of the committee
members did not satisfy their
examiners and another is
news editor for Felix. How-
ever, organisation is our
raison d'etre. If anyone wants
to spend time helping others,
we try to provide the oppor-
tunity or put them in touch
with someone who can.
Perhaps the most spectacu-
lar of our activities are the
tegular bloOd doning sessions.
Anyone who has seen these
going on must realise how
much work they require.
However, Mood is often
needed quickly, so we also
organise an emergency
scheme, with volunteers from
the Halls of Residence.
Work Parties
Work parties are another
of our activities. At week-
ends, groups of three or four
go off to decorate a room in
Notting Hill—often for an
old widow living alone in
just that one room. If this is
so, we put her on top of her
furniture at one end of the
room, while we start at the
other. It soon becomes appar-
ent that everybody assumed
that someone else knew how
to hang paper. A little later,
it generally turns out that
anyone who puts his scientific
training to it can turn out a
pretty good job. By Saturday
lunchtime, about 3 o'clock,
calculation puts the finishing
time about next Thursday,
associated committees. These
speeches, the only serious
part of the meeting, were
generally very straightfor-
ward, and should go a long
way towards introducing the
newcomers to RCSU.
At the end of the meeting,
the only long-haired skin-
but it usually turns out that
on Sunday afternoon, four
good friends wash their
brushes and rearrange the
furniture in a bright new
room.
Odd things have been
known to happen. I remem-
ber one young lady who was
sent out by three men on
Sunday afternoon to buy a
packet of razor blades!
Help for the Blind
Have you ever wondered
what would happen if you
were blinded tomorrow? For
some young men and women
the courageous answer was
to take up physiotherapy. To
qualify they must reach A
level standard in physics and
know a great deal of anat-
omy and physiology. Some
of us go every week to read
text books to them. For those
who cannot manage such a
regular commitment we need
help tape recording books for
the Royal Normal College
for the blind. Grundig gener-
head Butty in captivity at-
tempted to sneak out with-
out a rendition of a Kangela.
He (it?) was quickly brought
back to " do his thing ", but
since the freshers had not
been taught the words, the
audience reaction was not
overwhelming in volume.
ously gave us a tape recorder,
so that anyone with half an
hour to spare can help.
Every so often we are
asked to visit an old person.
They would usually like
someone to go regularly, to
talk to them over a cup of
tea and relieve their loneli-
ness. Although we operate a
rota, they appreciate the con-
tinuity of regular visitors.
Youth work is another of
our activities, normally
through a youth club. One
of the rewarding jobs in this
field is to help and encour-
age bright children from dull
homes. I heard that that one
of our members enthralled
her charge with a visit to a
pond to find tadpoles and
water beetles.
There are students in the
college who have special in-
terests in jobs such as organ-
ising the families in sub-
standard accommodation in
Notting Hill, helping meths
drinkers, or running soup kit-
chens in the East End. We
give them as much help as
Nowhere
to Stay ?
Dear Editor,
I have seen a few tatty
notices strewn around the
cOUege, attributing the pres-
ent shortage of lodgings to
(1) the decision to tell land-
ladies that they would be
struck off the register if they
demonstrated racial demon-
stration, (2) the prejudice of
landladies, and (3) the in-
adequacy of the U.L. Lodg-
ings Bureau.
Might I not more accur-
ately attribute the shortage
to lack of vision on the part
of those persons responsible
for that decision ? It would
not have required much in-
telligence for those persons
to have anticipated that their
decision would result in land-
ladies withdrawing from the
register.
1 think perhaps that these
pioneers of ' equality for
all' might do well to do
penance, by sleeping with the
other homeless students who
have been so generously of-
fered the Union Lounge as a
temporary dwelling.

Reports
The Parliamentary Select
Committee Report on Staff/
Student relations is due to be
published in mid-OctOber.
The Committee was set up
to investigate the causes for
student unrest in colleges and
was received with a great

of the colleges it visited. A

work.
After all this you may be
wondering why you haven't
seen any strange people
about the college with suffer-

The answer is simple: they
enjoy doing it and don't need
any other reward.
