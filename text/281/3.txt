Height of Stupidity Unfair on the
L e t t e r s
Parking Confusion
Taxpayer
Dear Sir,
I wish to make a strong
complaint through your
columns to those people who
run (sic) the car parking ap-
plications for students.
I applied for a parking
space well before the adver-
tised first allocation date,
and two weeks later when I
planned to leave home for
college, I still had not heard
whether I had been allocated
a place or not. It was only
after an expensive trunk
telephone call that I found
that I had not been allocated
a place. At the time of writ-
ing, well into the first week
of term, I have still not
heard officially whether I
have a place or not.
I do not wish to complain
about not getting a place.
What I will complain about

Sore Eyes)
Congratulations to the
powers that B. on the
efficiency of the new College
Block. For the benefit of
those who have not yet ven-
tured in, perhaps a short
tour would help clarify the
situation slightly.
You arrive in the main
foyer with the intention of
obtaining a meal in the
lower refectory. You stride
into the ante-room and
bump into the queue. This
seems rather long and very
static, so you decide to try
the upstairs snack bar, or
"buttery" if you're that way
inclined. You climb the out-
side stairs and walk along
the covered promenade.
"Ah", you think, "I've
found the bookshop at last.
Perhaps they've got that
book I was recommended
this morning." No such luck,
so you decide to leave and
walk towards the door. Oh!
There doesn't seem to be a
handle on the inside of the
door, so you have to wait
in the queue to pass the cash
desk.
Having escaped you try
to find the snack bar. Again,
no luck; there doesn't seem
to be such a place. However
you realise that the way in
may be through the wide
open spaces of the students'
common room. Propelled by
the elastic properties of
some of the temporary
wooden paving stones, you
try to find the door to the
is the inefficiency in dealing
with a matter that is of
great concern to many stu-
dents. It is the difference
between bringing half a ton
of luggage relatively easily
in one's car, or travelling by
train; it is the difference be-
tween coming to a car park-
ing space in College, or ar-
riving here and finding that
you have to park two miles
away in Fulham.
Just as a point of in-
terest, just how are the car
parking places allocated ?
How many people have any
idea of what goes on ? Is
the system as democratic
(sic) as some of the Hall
selection procedures ?
Yours sincerely,

common room. "At last"
you think with saliva drip-
ping from the corner of your
mouth, and you thrust your
hand against . . . a locked
door. You confidently thrust
your hand against the other
side of the double door and
sprain the other wrist.
Having eventually found
your way to the snack bar
and queued for only about
20 minutes, you arrive at the
service area. You obtain
your meal and a cup of
tea and miscellaneous ex-
tras on your new style tray,
stop abruptly, and the whole
lot falls off the edge. Hav-
ing replenished your stocks
you are at last ready to sit
down and enjoy your meal.
But wait ! What are all
those psople doing stand-
ing around with meals on
trays. They are waiting to
sit down (whatever did
happen to those comfy
sofas ?)
Now enjoy your meal —
it may be your last unless
you the lucky enough to find
the bank.
Seriously, though, the re-
fectory facilities appear to
have been seriously de-
pleted and 'the closing of the
Union snack bar has left a
great void, especially in the
morning when only coffee
may be obtained at a time
when most people are in
need of breakfast. Surely it
would be possible to reopen
the Union snack bar in its
original state.

Sir,
I feel that I cannot let pass
without comment the inform-
ation given in the last edition
about the lodgings situation.
While few people at IC can
have anything but disgust for
racial prejudice, I feel that it
was the height of stupidity to
alter the system used for
many years by the lodgings
bureau of keeping a separate
list of landladies willing to
accept coloured students.
Surely it is better to send a
coloured student to lodgings
where he is reasonably cer-
tain of a good reception than
to send him to lodgings where
his reception would be, at the
least, one of mistrust, more
probably one of open hostil-
ity. And what of the students
from this country? Lodgings
were at the best of times
never easy to come by. Now,
with only freshers receiving
help from the lodgings
bureau, as 90 per cent of the
landladies in the West Lon-
don area have been struck
off the list, the situation is
chaotic. The number of
students arriving back at

The way in which land-
ladies were informed of the
decision to insist that they
accept coloured students was,
to say the least, tactless. I saw
the letter that was sent to my
last year's landlady and it
in effect took the form of a
threat. My landlady, who had
taken in a coloured student in
the past, took what must have
been a typical attitude—that
no-one was to tell her what
to do in her own house and
that the lodgings bureau
could go to hell.
I cannot see that anything
but harm has come through
this action. Very few land-
ladies can now be taking
coloured students, who did
not take them in the past. A
large number of landladies
have been antagonised and
are now less willing to take
in students at all. This means
that all London students,
coloured or not, are now
finding it more difficult to
find lodgings.

Dear Sir,
Most of us are aware that
90 per cent of the addresses
of the Lodgings Bureau in
the West London area have
been struck off due to the
reluctance of Landlords to
take overseas students. This
attitude of the landlords has
been " righteously " con-
demned by London Univer-
sity, but nobody seems to
consider that there are
reasons why British Univer-
sities should not accept over-
seas students in the first
jpl&ce. (Let us define here
that an overseas student is
one who does not hold and
is not entitled to hold a U K
passport, i.e. an alien. This
is a non-racial definition, as
one does not have to be a
white anglo-saxon to have a
UK passport.)
The main reason why we
should not accept overseas
students is that there are not
enough places in our Uni-
versities. The minimum ent-
rance requirement for most
Universities is 2 A level
passes and as yet our Univer-
sities cannot offer places to
all the Britons who have
these qualifications. If any-
one doubts this contact
UCCA clearing scheme!
Other countries, notably West
Germany, are obliged to give
anyone who has passed the
national school - leaving
exams a place. In Britain we
can do nothing like this, so
it would appear unfair on the
British taxpayer to keep
British students out of places
occupied by an overseas
student.
It has been pointed out
that many of our best
students are from overseas;
are they, however, better
than our best? Furthermore,
will these excellent students
contribute a n y t h i n g to
B r i t a i n ? What overseas
students pay in extra fees is
nothing compared to the loss
to Britain of a trained tech-
nologist.
When we have enough
places to train our own
people, then we can offer
places to overseas students.
Until then it is intellectual
genocide to refuse places to
eligible Britons because their
place is occupied by someone
who will return to his own
country when his education is
finished.
Yours faithfully,
"GEORGE X " .
