A Biased Look at Modern Music in some of its Manifestations
If we believe what our ears and eyes tell us, pop music is
now becoming respectable. The evidence is all around, in
the newspapers, on the radio and television, and in the
magazines that clutter the bookstalls.
Just before the start of the session the Deep Purple/
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra concert was given a great
deal of advance publicity as something new in the music
world, when only a few years ago such an idea would have
been thought ludicrous. The fact remains: some of the older
generation are now condescending to take the younger
generation's music seriously. Tony Palmer has been the
first reviewer to take pop music as something more than
just an idle entertainment for the young; his regular column
in the Observer points out both its faults and its virtues
without ever taking a paternalistic attitude.
Now the Sunday Times produces its "jazz/pop" column
and occasionally deigns to remove some "jazz" to make way
for a little "pop" to be reviewed; almost all the daily news-
papers run a weekly feature including brief record reviews
not all singles, thankfully — as well as the inevitable top
ten chart and some sort of gossip column about "pop per-
sonalities". The business is booming, glowing under its
newly acquired halo of respectability.
But even the most enthusiastic pop fan would admit it
is a halo undeserved by the greater part of the business.
Pop music is just a label used by most people to describe any
kind of music not classifiable as jazz or classical, it can be
divided and subdivided into many different kinds of music.
Mainly, however, there are two kinds of pop. There is pop
music you buy as L.P.s and hear in the record shops, and
there is pop music you hear on the radio (apologies to John
Peel) and buy as singles at extortionate prices. Sadly, it
is the latter which gets all the playing time on radio and
television.
The former have taken on various other labels in an
attempt to dissociate themselves from the "teenybopper"
groups but people still call them pop groups because a great
deal of their exponents started off as small-time pop groups
in the '63-'66 era when groups were the big fashion. In
those days they made their living by having a single released
which was pushed into the charts by some enterprising record
company, and the resulting publicity was enough for them
to be signed up for one-night stands and dances for the
next few months. A great deal of the groups disappeared
almost as soon as they had been created but some kept on,
disregarded the hit parade and started producing albums of
their own material — some good, some bad, but almost all
original. They progressed but the word "progressive" has
become a word almost of abuse used by pop fans who
find themselves unable to understand music produced by
the "underground" music faction.
Anyone who watches "Top of the Pops" every week
will recognise the average teenybopper group. Three or four
people, if that is the right name for them, stand idly
strumming guitars, fingers hardly moving on the strings,
someone — or something — else apathetically brushes the
top of a drum with a drumstick, perhaps there's an organ
or a stringless piano for realism, while a gibbering trans-
vestite hops around at the front of the stage waving a micro-
phone about. Somewhere, you can hear an orchestra playing.
It is no wonder that the average age of the 45-rpm-record
buyer is about twelve or thirteen, especially considering the
cost of singles today.
Nevertheless, it is the youngsters who put records in
the hit-parade who have controlled a great deal of the
trends in modern music. The groups whose records regularly
top the L.P. charts readily admit that a great deal of their
success relied on publicity they received appearing on tele-
vision, and the few available television record shows all deal
exclusively with the singles market. On the other hand,
during the past year, BBC 2 produced "Colour me Pop"
which has done a great deal to further the recognition of
many progressive pop groups, and groups like Led Zeppelin,
Fairport Convention, Chickenshack have all had very good
album sales without the benefit of a successful single.
So is it right that the only branch of pop music to be
given an appreciable amount of broadcasting time is that
which the rest of pop music would be gladly rid of?
Long live John Peel and his precious two or three hours
broadcasting time; it may not be the easiest to listen to,
but at least it sets you thinking.
