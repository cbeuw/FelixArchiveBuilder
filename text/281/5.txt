COLCUTT
It's nice to be back in dear old London, or is it ? J.
Elroy Flecker may have been thinking of students looking
for lodgings when he said:—
"Half to forget the wandering and the pain,
Half to remember the days that have gone by,
And dream and dream that I am home again."
That I should imagine sums up many London student's
attitude to being in the news once more.
The accommodation problem grows steadily worse
year by year, and this year has been no exception. As the
number of students continually grows the accommodation
available remains almost static.
In fact this year for many reasons it has probably de-
creased. The traditional digs that are provided and officially
approved by U.L. Lodgings Bureau has been cut back
drastically by the action of U.L. Presidents Council last
year.
A reasonable statement of intent to prohibit racialism
in student accommodation has been turned into a catas-
trophe by inept handling. An all too common wrangle be-
tween student politicians and college administrators has
again resulted in hardship for the college student, par-
ticularly those new to the game of catch-as-oatch-can be-
tween landlord and tenant.
To imagine that the landlords are feeling the cold winds
from Siberia by losing student tenants is to be more than
naive but to submit to their blackmail is probably worse.
What was needed from the U.L. administration was careful
handling rather than hostile interpretation of Council's
wishes. However not all the blame rests with the U.L. ad-
ministration, much of it must be carried by Council itself,
since it must have realised it was not bargaining from a
position of strength. Still, I expect that all the students
living out of suitcases at the moment are doing so with
great gladness knowing that such fine principles are being
upheld.
As far as can be seen, this, and many other factors that
are making accommodation difficult, if not impossible, to
obtain points in one direction only, to a tight control of
landlords letting furnished premises. This has been chewed
over more times than a Mooney steak, all that remains is
to see what our local M.P.s can be forced to do about it
in the next election.
Coming back to College we have the new Student
House and a new lodgings bureau: they both appear to be
shaping up well, although the latter shows evidence of the
landlords' inevitable grip. Perhaps the two further Houses,
accommodating a total of 120 students will be able to
alleviate a few more problems; although one presumes that
opening two months earlier they would have been far more
useful. Why, oh why, when a decision is made to finance
these Houses it should take more than twelve months to
complete them is impossible to imagine. The conversion, is
minimal, yet the contractors are in for months and it's the
same all along the line.
We must put our priorities right: a student can't study
unless he has a place to live, this of all things must come
first.
What is
Colcutt?
Colcutt was a person, not
a thing, and was responsible
for the erection of Colcutt's
Tower, otherwise known by
its more correct name of
the Queen's Tower (the
Queen in question being
Victoria). This tower was
part of the Imperial In-
stitute, now mostly demo-
lished to make way for
College Block. Only the
tower was preserved, and
was cleaned up and greatly
strengthened at a cost of
over £200,000. It is rather
difficult to miss standing
alone before College Block.
"Colcutt" is the pseu-
donym under which a pro-
minent Union personality
writes a comment column
in FELIX. The identity of
the author of this piece is
normally known only to the
Editor. The writer is im-
agined as sitting on the top
of Colcutt's Tower surveying
the IC scene, and passing
comments thereupon.
Confusing the Issue
One of the most confusing
things that freshers come up
against at this College is
the incredible number of
abbreviations and initials
used by the students already
here. In an attempt to
alleviate the confusion for
new students and also for
any ill-informed second
year students, here is a
quick run-down on just what
those initials do mean.
ICU: Imperial College
Union.
RCSU: Royal College of
Science Union.
C&GU: City and Guilds
Union.
RSMU: Royal School of
Mines Union.

haven't yet found out
what these are, you must
be apathetic.)

Royal College of Science.
ACGI: Associate of the City
and Guilds Institute.
ARSM: Associate of the
Royal School of Music.

UGM: Union General Meet-
ing.
ICRC: Imperial College
Representative Council
(proposed).
RCC: Recreational Clubs

SCC: Social Clubs Com-
mittee.
ACC: Athletic Clubs Com-

After the above ICU
bodies, how about a few
Administration com-
mittees?
JURGO: Joint Union, Rec-
tor, and Governors Com-
mittee.
BoG: Board of Governors.
GoB: Governing Body.
(These last two are one
and the same of course,
but go under two names
to confuse you!)
F&E: Finance and Executive

UGC: University Grants
Comm.
LEA: Local Education
