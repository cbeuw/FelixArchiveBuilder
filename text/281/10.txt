FRESHERS' DAY
I.C. SLEEP-IN
Until May, 1969, the U L lodgings bureau had a policy
which invited racial discrimination among landladies. After a
long discussion on how to handle the situation which would
probably ensue, ULU Presidents Council said that this policy
must end. Lodgings bureau landladies in the West London
area were asked to accept the new policy; only 10% agreed.
ICU's amateur bureau has been working reasonably well,
but the situation was still rough on Freshers' Day, so the
President, Piers Corbyn, arranged for the Union Upper
Lounge to be made available to homeless students. So on
Monday might the fight against racialism was carried into
ICU by six •students, who slept comfortably on the thick
carpet to be welcomed at 0.7.30 by the cleaners. The sleep-in
continued throughout the week with a transient batch of
between 8 and 4 happy (?) students. (But were there more on
Southside floors ?) The sleepers interspersed their slumbers
with jollities with the cleaners in the morning and trips to
South Ken Wimpy Bar at night.
Our activities could be more positively anti-racial if ICU
appointed a Lodgings officer Who had time to discuss with
the landlords the question of racialism—something the U L
Lodgings Bureau refuses to do anything about.
POST-GRAD GRANTS
At present the majority of past-graduate students receive
an annual grant of £530 from the Science Research Council.
As reported elsewhere in FELIX the A.S.T.M.S. has recently
gained a salary increase related by a job evaluation exercise
to the work the technician is actually doing.
It might be a good idea to have the same evaluation applied
to post-graduate earnings. Any sensible evaluation should
lead to a salary vastly greater than that now received. £1250
per annum is not unreasonable with annual increments of
£100 and a London allowance of £125.
After all, post-graduate work should be right for the
community and the results of research evaluated and
utilised properly. If a person doing research is to feel a full
sense of belonging to the community as a whole and to feel
that his work is worthwhile he should be paid on a par with
other full time university qualified workers, not be treated as
a cheap method of doing advanced and necessary work.
Even the present government puts university finance under
the social service sector of the economy instead of moving it
to the more reasonable investment sector—surely research
and education is an investment if ever there was one.
In the 1964 National Plan universities were going to have
their costs linked with school milk and the infamous "imputed
rent"—money that the government would have if it had built
flats instead of schools and universities.
Universities now have an allotted sum—that left over when
the other social services have been accounted for. The atti-
tude towards post-graduate grants seems to be that the univer-
sities can certainly give p.g's more grants but the number of
p.g's must decrease accordingly to keep the allocation con-
stant. This is obviously ridiculous.
Furthermore Her Majesty's Opposition has seriously
mooted the idea of further debasing research by introducing
loans for post-graduate students. This would only have the
detrimental effect of lowering standards, productivity and of
course ensuring that still more students go abroad to study.
As long as p.g's continue to acquiesce in the present situa-
tion, however, there can be little hope of an improvement.
This year's freshers had the
usual introduction to I.C. on
freshers day: a meeting in
the Royal Geographical
Society headquarters in Ex-
hibition Road. There were,
however, a number of breaks
with tradition: President
Piers Corbyn refused to wear
a suit or academic gown,
there were none of the path-
etic jokes Which every other
group of freshers has had to
endure, (there were no
speeches from the constituent
College Presidents, their
places being taken over by
the Welfare, External Affairs
and Academic Officers.
The meeting was opened
by the Rector, who started
his speech with a series of
Statistics about the college.
He went on to explain die
progress of the College ex-
pansion programme, which is
now 75 % completed with just
the Chemistry and Maths
buildings to come. Lord
Penney followed this with a
description of the area in the
Colege block common to
staff and students (see page
4).
The Rector finished by
emphasising the importance
of joining Clubs and societies,
and said he thought anyone
who spent his whole Univer-
sity career doing academic
work would not be gaining
all he could from his stay
here.
Piers Corbyn (then intro-
duced the Union officials
present, and delivered his
welcoming speech, the greater
part of which dealt With the
academic nature of I.C. He
started by suggesting that the
education given at any Uni-
versity is designed only to
produce graduates for indus-
try, where they will become
an integral part of the
economy. Speaking about I.C.
specifically Piers dismissed
the idea that we have an aca-
demic community; according
to his way of thinking an
academic community implies
social equality between all
sections of the College, and
an atmosphere of free and
critical discussion. He felt
that alt I.C. an academic
community did not exist
since students had no real
influence in the direction of
the path which I.C. is taking.
To produce a real academic
community the President
thought that the students
should have mandatable re-
presentation on the Govern-
ing body and on the smaller
but more important Finance
and Executive Committee of
this Body.
Mr. Corbyn went on to dis-
close the results of a survey
held last year which showed
that 96% of undergraduates
wanted some non-technical
subjects as part of their
degree course. He expressed
a hope that the authorities, in
discussion with the Students
Union, Would introduce the
changes necessary to intro-
duce broader courses.
The President concluded by
saying that this was an im-
portant year for the Union,
and that there were many
important issues coming up
for discussion, concerned
with both the Union itself
and its relation with other
groups. He felt that in all
discussions and negotiations
the freshers would find that
it is not rules or requests
which really decide things—it
is the balance of forces —
which means our ability to
organise ourselves and act to-
gether.
After a few words from the
other speakers, the freshers
moved off to a reception in
their own departments.

POETS PERFORM
The incomparable Barrow
poets treated I.C. students to
a further selection of their
own distinctive brand of
poetry, humour and music
during General Studies on
Thursday, Oct. 2nd.
This was their seventh visit
to I.C. and the poets are fast
becoming a regular feature of
general studies. They were
very enthusiastically received
by a large gathering in the
Union lower lounge, and
went straight into their act,
beginning with a comic duo-
logue between two men at an
art gallery and proceeding
through a welter of music old
and new intermingled with
poetry from a l eras.
The bulk of the recitation
was carried by William
Bealby-Wright and Gerard
Benson, who also joined in
the music making with vari-
ous odd-looking and odd-
sounding instruments.
The Barrow poets first ap-
peared in 1951, going around
the London pubs reciting
D R A M S O C
This coming year should
be a big one for the Dramatic
Society —DRAMSOC. Each
year we do three productions,
one each term. All these need
actors, stage crew, set build-
ers and many more to do all
the odd jobs that turn up.
In addition to these
three productions, we are
planning a tour for the next
long vacation. This will de-
pend on getting a good play,
a good producer and good
actors. If we can get all these
then we are away, the des-
tination — the United States
of America.
So if you are in the least
bit interested in any aspect
of the theatre come along
and see us some evening,
you'll always be welcome.
poems which they had pre-
viously been prohibited from
selling from a barrow—hence
the name. Now they are in
constant demand at Festivals,
Universities and Colleges, but
despite tiieir current suc-
cesses away from the pubs,
they are still continuing to
appear at one London pub
for an Autumn season. They
can currently be seen at the
Sir Christopher Wren, Pater-
noster Square, EC4 every
Thursday evening at 8.30
p.m. until November 13th
(Students with Union Cards
can hear them for just 2/6).
Among the poetry recited
was Spike Hawkins' "The
Man they Loved to Hut" and
Adrian Mitchell's "Nothing-
mas Day", which cleverly
considered Christmas without
any festivities, negating all
-the false customs and atti-
tudes concerned with the
occasion. Short pieces of
music, including an Eliza-
bethan dance by William Bird
played by Susan Baker, were
intermingled with (the poetry
to good effect.
What makes the act so
unique is Ithe immediacy of
communication in (the poetry
recitation; poetry about 'Situ-
ations and problems one
knows about and appreciates
instinctively, and it is this
which (brings new life to the
spoken word.
