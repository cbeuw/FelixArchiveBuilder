A Drinker's Guide to I. C.
The number and standard
of the bars at I.C. is well
known and envied through-
out the London colleges.
There are two main bars and
5 others open to students, as
well as the many temporary
bars set up at parties, etc,
while the staff have their
own drinking places in the
SCRs. A l l of these are free
houses, and the major ones
can boast of a range of
drinks that will beat most
pubs and other colleges; at
least 5 different keg bitters
are available.
By far the most popular
place to drink in the College
is the Southside bar. The
senior barman here is Mr.
Stan Kearns, who has run
this bar for 4 years now. He
is justifiably proud of the
changes that have taken
place during this period.
In 1965, the bar sold only
two draught beers, one brand
each of whisky and gin, had
few bottled beers on its one
cold shelf, and had no keg
cider, wines, or sherry. Four
years later there are 9 beer
pumps, and one has only
to look along the packed
shelves behind the bar to see
the fantastic range of bottled
beers, wines, spirits, and
liqueurs. Teetotallers need
have no fears, as Stan stocks
a full selection of non-
alcoholic drinks. Indeed,
although the ICU President
is frequently seen in the bar,
the strongest thing he ever
drinks is orange crush!
However, the popularity
of Southside bar has
brought problems. The first,
gross overcrowding, is ob-
Drinkers photographed recently in the Union Bar. On the
shelves behind the bar are many tankards, given to the
students by their Unions, clubs and societies.

vious to the harassed cus-
tomer trying to force his way
through to the counter after
about 9 p.m., and is equally
obvious to the equally
harassed and over-worked
barmen. Since the bar opened
over 5 years ago, the turn-
over has increased more
than threefold, but the
number of barmen has only
gone up by one. On some
occasions the situation is so
bad that the bar can only
function by using temporary
student barmen. Even so,
the staff are often so busy
serving drinks that they have
no time to go out and collect
glasses, and so a shortage
of glasses occurs. Some of
the students who have helped
out in the bar confirm how
overworked the bar staff
are.
Stan attributes the lack of
barmen to two principal
causes: firstly the pay is poor
compared to the majority of
pubs, and secondly there is
no accommodation for bar
staff provided by the
College. The latter point is
important, as it is difficult to
get home by public trans-
port by the time the barmen
have closed and tidied up the
bar. Stan claims that 6
months have passed since
the Refectory Committee
agreed that the barmen
should have a rise and that
attempts would be made to
provide them with flats near
the College. However, so far
this lumbering body has
failed to implement either
decision, and the best reply
Stan has been able to get is
"we've got that in mind too".
Stan hopes for results now
that Dr. Ken Weale has
become chairman of the new
Bar Committee.
Another urgent problem
in Southside as far as the
bar staff are concerned is
the acute shortage of storage
space. The small beer cellar
can only hold 3 to 4 days
supply of keg and tank beer,
while crates of bottled beers
have to be stacked up at the
ends of the bar. A further
growing nuisance in South-
side is rowdiness. Despite the1
price differential between the
Union and Southside bars,
many drinkers think that
2d per pint is a not unreason-
able price to pay for the
vastly improved comfort of
the latter bar. On some nights
it is not wise to take in a
timid girlfriend, a fact which
many users of the only bar
suitable for entertaining girls
find rather annoying. Dis-
cipline in the bars is the
responsibility of the student
duty officers, and Stan hopes
that they will keep the
rowdiness down in the
future.
One possible way to avoid
customers overcrowding the
bar is to open up the hardly-
used SCR buttery to
students, and employ more
barmen to staff this. How-
ever, this is unlikely to
Linstead bar, which opened last January, is the ideal
place for a quiet drink, and the Hall is well known for its
parties and Disco-bars.
occur as certain staff mem-
bers jealously guard their
right to have their own bar
on the few nights a month
they want to use it.
Passing on from the crush
of Southside, one can call
in either Linstead or Weeks
Hall (or both). Here the bars
are student run, so the
standard of service is on
occasion a little unpro-
fessional. These are definitely
the bars for a quiet evening
drink, though the service
tends to suffer when the un-
paid student barmen decide
to drink away the evening's
profits!
Walking along to the Beit
building, one may enter the
Union bar after first leaving
one's girl-friend outside this
all-male preserve. This bar
tends to be either half empty
(midweek) or packed out
(weekends and special func-
tions), and the standard of
behaviour is way below that
of the other bars. The
amount of custom on normal
days has dropped off sharply
over the past year, and with
the redecorating and refur-
bishing of the bar and the
crushes in Southside, it re-
mains to be seen whether
the usage of the bar will re-
turn to a more reasonable
level. The stock of beers
here is extensive, but there
are few wines or liqueurs.
Ladies can get service, with
a bit of luck, at the exten-
sion bar in the corner of the
Union lower lounge.
The Crush bar, outside the
concert hall in the Union
building, opens on dance
nights to serve a limited
range of beers.
Finally, lunchtime drinks
will be available at the new
College Block bars. The
students' bars will not open
at night except for special
functions. Fears have been
expressed that this bar will
prove to be totally in-
adequate to cope with such
functions. There is very
limited space to store beer
with no cold store for keg
beer, though the breweries
will provide flash coolers
for the keg in use.
The Senior Common
Room bar is even more in-
adequate, and, is notable for
its two-glass size washing up
sink! At the time of writing,
the bar shutters cannot be
locked. It is apparent that
some of the design mistakes
made in Southside have been
repeated here.
That concludes the
FELIX tour of the bars in
IC. Now it is up to you, the
reader, to use and enjoy the
facilities.
The price and range of
drinks betters almost all the
nearby pubs. Don't be put
off by the six deep crush
at the start of term, and re-
member that any bar gets
crowded in the late evening.
If you help the barman, he'll
help you. For example, if
there is a shortage of glasses
don't just go and get one
for yourself, take back as
many as you can. If you in-
tend to get drunk, don't go
to one of the lounge bars.
In these, and other ways, you
can help to improve the
facilities both for yourself
and for the other users.
Pleasant drinking!
The Southside Senior Barman, Stan Kearns, relaxes for
a moment in one of the infrequent quiet spells in this1
bar.
