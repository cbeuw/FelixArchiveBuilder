EDITORIAL
In previous years it has been customary for the chairman
of clubs committees to speak at the freshers reception. This
year however, it was decided that there were more urgent
matters with which to bore the freshers and the more mun-
dane affairs of college life could not be mentioned. I should
like to take this opportunity, therefore, of welcoming freshers
to the college and point out that although there may be many
things wrong with IC in the field of student participation etc,
there are many things for which IC is rightly respected, not
least of which is our sporting tradition.
It is fair to say that for many years now IC teams have,
if not dominated, at least strongly challenged other London
colleges in allfieldsof sporting activity. If the initial en-
thusiasm shown on Freshers day and at thefirsttrials can
be maintained there is no reason to suppose that this
challenge will fail this year.
With about 200 freshers attending trials at Harlington
it is clear that there will be no shortage of players for the
rugby, football and hockey teams. ICWA hockey club, in
fact, suddenly found itself with a regular team and is now
looking for regular fixtures.
Other clubs were also well supported on freshers day and
it is hoped that the boat club and cross country clubs will
have yet another successful season. Elsewhere on this page
you will hear of the prospects and hopes of various ACC
clubs and I should like to wish every club a successful and,
just as important, an enjoyable year's sport.
Cricket
The cricket club ended an undistinguished season
with an undistinguished tour — at least as far as results
go. Although 7 matches were lost out of 9, the standard
of play remained high. This in part due to the fact that
results were only of secondary importance, — though another
defeat by the LSE wasn't too welcome.
For the benefit of newcomers, we tour Devon, playing
local Clubs around Plymouth and Torquay. It is the high-
light of the season, offering an all too welcome relief from
exams. During the early part of the season we try to run
about 4 XI's, every Wednesday and Saturday. Including
the tour this adds up to about 30 matches a season!
Nevertheless, we have found that the shortness of the
summer term and the pre-ocoupation with exams then tends
to interfere with cricket. For this reason we run nets during
the winter at AM Gover's cricket school in East Putney on
Sundays, so that the club can get settled down before the
season proper starts. If you play any kind of cricket, we
would advise you to join now rather than wait until summer,
because besides offering coaching facilities, the school is
an excellent social club. It is well worth joining for this alone.
If you wish to play at all and we haven't got your name
yet, get in touch with Tony Furling, 28 Weeks or Russ
Smith, Maths 2.
Badminton
The Badminton club (annual subscription 12/6) runs three
men's teams, one mixed and one ladies' team. There is club
play on Monday evenings (ladies), Wednesday afternoons,
and Saturday and Sunday mornings in -the Gym. The club
caters for players of all standards, from the complete begin-
ner to the player with many seasons of experience behind
him.
The home courts are no longer at Nine Elms Baths, but
have moved to Wimbledon Baths, which open on October
15th. (I must hasten to add that we play on a covered pool
— sub-aqua badminton has yet to reach its peak of
popularity.) These courts will mainly be used for team
matches, but will be available for club play when there are
no fixtures.
With the exception of last season, when the mixed team
put the rest of us to shame, the first men's and mixed teams
have had an enormously successful record, having won the
ULU Division I championships for as long as student memory
goes back.
The intake of new members includes at least one county
and one ULU player, and there is every prospect that the
clubs is returning to its former playing strength.

Football
With over 90 names taken on freshers day, the Soccer Club
is hoping to field several strong sides this season. Freshers
trials were held last Wednesday and with such a large num-
ber of players present it was difficult to assess them all.
However, several promising players have already emerged.
It is evident that with such strong competition for places all
teams should be able to maintain a high standard.
The final trials on Saturday last (including last year's
players) simplified selection of the teams for the opening
matches yesterday.
This has been a promising start to the season and provided
this support for all the teams continues the club looks for-
ward to a very successful season. Tom McCardle
Rugby
As most freshers will have
been bombarded by anti-
Rugby Club literature dur-
ing their short stay here so
far, it might be a good idea
to show the other (perhaps
more realistic) side of our
reactionary, alcoholic, anti-
Left-wing image.
The RFC is one of the
oldest of IC clubs and is
thus, by definition, steeped
in tradition; perhaps this is
why it has been the target
for such a dramatic smear
campaign of late.
Injuries
For many years IC
dominated London college
rugby, but last season—due
mainly to gross bad luck and
unfortunate injuries to vital
team members — we suf-
fered a few losses. How-
ever, this season, with 60
new members in the club,
prospects look bright both
on the playing and on the
social side. While the main
aim of the 1st X V will be to
win the Gutteridge cup
(played for amongst London
colleges) once again, the
other 6 XVs will be striving
to maintain their fine records
of being successful on and
especially off the field.
Remember that the Club
is the most socially minded
in IC — it cannot be beaten
for the sense of fellowship
its members enjoy; this goes
far deeper than its often
attacked bar image.

Water Polo
The Water Polo Club this
past summer explored the
depths of darkest Devon.
The team's spartan discipline
was sorely tried by the mis-
cellaneous vices rife in the
Torquay YMCA, but, in-
spired by the example of the
moral guardian, Mr.
Spooner its members' sob-
riety was matched only by
their willingness to train in
the 53°C water.
Water temperature proved
to be a crucial factor in the
team's success. In warm
water pools at Brixham and
Exeter emphatic victories of
14-2 and 10-0 were recorded,
whereas at Devonport, in a
pool at 56°C we were lucky
to obtain a 5-5 draw after
being 3-0 up after the first
quarter. It is thought that
this temperature effect was
due to excessive loss of body
heat in passing Swedish
schoolgirls in Torquay. The
last match, against the
Devon county champions,
Exmouth, in the inter-
national pool there, pro-
duced some very fine polo,
and some very imaginative
refereeing. IC defeated' Ex-
mouth by 6-4. The result of
the match between IC and
the referee was a decided
victory for the latter.
So the tour was, on the
whole, very successful, with
no defeats and one very
good and unexpected win in
the last match. Needless to
say, the virulence of the
cider of Devon revenged any
embarrassment caused to its
polo players.

The freshers' trial was
held on Wednesday 1st
October, and was attended
by about 30 people. This
was not as many as had
been expected, and it is to
be hoped that the absentees
have not been overcome by
academic work at this early
stage of the term.
Those who attended were
able to take part in two or
three games during the after-
noon on the pitches which
have been used during the
long vac. for both an Inter-
national match between the
World champions Pakistan,
and the England U.23 XI,
and a game between an
England X I and the Middle-
sex county X L
There were several
promising newcomers to IC
hockey who made their
debut at the trials, and
coupling this with the fact
that 5 members of last years
1st X I have returned to
college we should have a
strong 1st X I this year.
However, anyone who
feels that he is not of 1st
team calibre need not worry
since we are hoping to run
5 elevens on Saturday this
year, so there will be plenty
of hockey for anyone who
wants it.
Anyone who wants to play
and has not yet been con-
tacted should see one of the
club officers listed below.
Captain: Mike Burtt: Fal-
mouth 244.
Fixture Secretary: J. Sar-
gent, Selkirk 664.
Treasurer: Peter Bates,
Weeks 82.
Mike Burtt
As the captain of the out-
going committee, it is my
privilege to have a final
word about the club activi-
ties of the 1968/69 season.
The opening of our own
courts in October '68 marked
the dawn of a new era in
the history of the squash
club, and IC has again
become the force it once was
in London University
squash.
The first team performed
consistently well through-
out the season, losing only
3 league matches out oi 20.
This success culminated in
their winning the league cup
by defeating UC in a very
tense and close fight. Owing
to the competitive keenness
shown by the members, 4
teams were fielded during
the season and a total of 100
matches were played, with
varying degrees of success in
the lower teams.
The Cambridge tour in
the Christmas term was
successful, but our tour of
Oxford, scheduled for the
following term, had to be
abandoned because of bad
road and weather conditions.
Regular coaching sessions
were organised on Wednes-
day afternoons and the
effort spent was well re-
warded in the improvement
exhibited by a considerable
proportion of the beginners
attending them.
With enthusiasm running
at its present high level, it
is confidently predicted that
the club will successfully
defend the cup it so deser-
vedly won earlier this year.
The biggest hit in
the cinema today!
