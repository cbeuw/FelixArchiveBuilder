On Common Rooms i n College Blocks
In: January the ector suggested that the 'Students Common Room on l e v e l 2' and the
' S e n i o r Common Room on l e v e l 11
"be opened to students and s t a f f , both teaching and non-
teaching. This was endorsed by C o u n c i l .
The agreement reached i n March was that members of the Holland Club (non-teaching
Staff) w i l l be able to use the Students Common -^oom on l e v e l 2 and the Senior Common
Room on l e v e l 1 which i s a l s o made a v a i l a b l e f o r the use of students.
Some members of C o u n c i l f e e l that the Union has been "conned" because there i s a
Senior Common Room on l e v e l 2 which students are not allowed to use despite the f a c t
t h a t Council endorsed the R e c t o r ' s Suggestion that the Students Common Room should be
open to everybody ( i n c l u d i n g members of the Senior Common Room).
I t seems to be a very odd that College Block was planned to take two Senior Common
Rooms ~ use of them conveniently opened to e v B r b o d y ( i l ) a f t e r ' ' n e g o t i a t i o n ' .
