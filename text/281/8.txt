Blind Faith
This is the first, and if
reports in the pop music
press are to be believed, the
last recorded offering we
shall hear from Clapton-Win-
wood-Baker-Grech. Heralded
on its formation in the early
summer as the first
American - termed super-
group Blind Faith played
just one free concert in
Hyde Park and then set off
to gain appreciation (and
money) in the States. Money
they have gained in plenty,
but it seems that the
pressures of living up to the
super-group image have
proved too great, and have
resulted in the break-up of
the group.
Those who are not for-
tunate enough to have atten-
ded the Hyde Park concert
are therefore left with this
one L.P. as the sole reminder
that the group ever existed.
Judging by the position of
the record in the L.P. charts
it seems that there will be
many besides myself who
qualify to write a personal
obituary, and predict what
might have been.
The L.P. consists of just
six tracks, which for a
studio recording is rather a
small number. It is however
quality which the reviewer
seeks to comment on, and in
any case the playing time
does exceed 40 minutes so
the group cannot be accused
of not covering all the avail-
able plastic.
The reason for the scarcity
of tracks is that on side two
Do What You Like almost
fills the side. This is the best
track of the L.P. and if, as
seems to be the tendency,
the group is considered as a
revamped Cream Do What
You Like is the best number
they have ever produced.
Bearing in mind some of the
legacies from the Cream-
Spoonful, Toad and I'm So
Glad — this statement needs
strong justification.
The basis for the track,
written by Ginger Baker is
a pulsating guitar rhythm by
Eric Clapton: add to this
Winwood singing at his best
and you have the first two
minutes. At this point the
sequence is broken by Win-
wood, who takes an organ
solo, followed in turn by
Clapton, Grech and Baker
who each express their ideas
in lengthy instrumental solos,
with the occasional accom-
panying chant of Do What
You Like in the background.
In comparing the two guitar
solos with the many instru-
mental produced by the
Cream it is important to
remember that neither Bruce
nor Clapton ever did a solo
and in all their instrumental
pieces one could always rely
on the other to provide a
new idea. On Blind Faith,
however, Clapton and Grech
both have to rely on their
own capacity for improvisa-
tion, which is a far harder
task. Nevertheless they both
do exceedingly well, Grech
more so than Clapton.
Winwood was responsible
for composing three of the
tracks on the L.P.: Sea of
Joy, Had to Cry Today and
Can't Find My Way Home
and although all are good
by normal standards none
compare with Baker's com-
position.
Of the other two tracks
Blind Faith's version of an
old Buddy Holly number
Well All Right must cause
him to turn in his grave.
This is, however, the second
best track on the record,
mainly because of the excit-
ing arrangement. Completing
the L.P. is a number by
Eric Clapton singing praises
to the Lord (sic).
Then Play On
Fleetwood Mac, Reprise.
In the last issue we re-
viewed the Fleetwood Mac's
L.P. "Pious Bird of Good
Omen", released by Blue
Horizon. Now working for
Reprise they have brought
out a new album and a
single, with material written
mainly by Danny Kirwen. In
contrast to the last L.P., the
material here is all new, and
much better than their pre-
vious efforts. The single
"Oh Well" is almost com-
pletely instrumental, as are
many of the tracks on the
L.P., but the tempo changes
abruptly at various places
throughout the record, some-
times switching from a quiet
Albatross-like sound to a
heavy stomping rhythm,
well worth listening to.
Clouds
Joni Mitchell, Reprise.
Joni Mitchell's second L.P.
takes over where the first
left off; some of the tracks
are well known already,
especially "Both Sides Now"
with which Judy Collins had
a great deal of success.
There are ten songs, all com-
posed by Joni Mitchell,
some, like Tin Angel, Chel-
sea Morning, and I Dont
Know Where I Stand have
been produced on previous
L.P.s by other folk singers,
but others are new to me.
This is not a record that
you enjoy the first time you
hear it, indeed very few
tracks have recognisable
melodies, but after you have
come accustomed to the
music, and have heard the
record through once or
twice, Joni Mitchell's fine
singing and guitar playing
seems very compelling. It is
a record to listen to rather
than have playing in the
background.
FILMS BOOKS
A night out in London to
visit the cinema poses its
own special problems. At the
weekends the whole of the
West End is inaccessible
from six p.m. onwards with
queues blocking the streets,
and it means waiting for at
least an hour to get in. Often
the cheap seats sell out
early, even more often cheap
seats don't exist. So if you
are prepared to spend vast
amounts of money with the
possibility of standing in the
rain all the early evening,
choose something worth
seeing, like Goodbye, Colum-
bus.
This is one of the new
style American films featur-
ing actors and actresses who
can act and an excellent
script. It was a surprise to
see the main character played
by Richard Benjamin,—I
did not recognise the name
but the face was familiar.
He is currently on T V play-
ing the husband in one of
the cosy-American-family-
life situation comedies the
BBC spends its money on.
Neil, the character he plays
in the film bears a great re-
semblance to the husband in
the T V series, which is
strange because no one
could describe Goodbye
Columbus as a cosy film,
and it would be ludicrous
to say his family life con-
formed to the American
Dream in the way all
American T V situation
comedies do.
Neil is a shiftless young
man living with his Aunt
and Uncle and working as a
clerk in the town public
library. In the opening
film sequence he meets
Brenda, a rich Jewish girl
on vacation from college.
She agrees to go out with
him, and in the traditional
American way, romance
blooms in the following few
days and they see each other
regularly. The girl's family
disapprove of him for his
lack of drive and ambition,
and Brenda herself tries to
encourage him to start in the
rat-race before it is too
late.
Freedom
Against her mother's
wishes Brenda invites Neil to
spend his fortnight's holiday
with her family, and after a
stormy beginning they settle
down to two weeks bliss to-
gether. Every night he tip-
toes along to her room to
sleep with her there, every
morning he dashes back to
his own before her father
rises. Finally, one night as
they are having a shower
together she mentions that
she is not using a contracep-
tive. From then on the
romance deteriorates as
Neil sees his freedom dis-
appearing.
Although the ending is far
from happy the film itself
is packed with humorous
asides, with both Richard
Benjamin and Ali McGraw,
who plays Brenda, showing
great comic talent. One of
the more spectacular points
in the film is the wedding
scene: Brenda's brother is a
muscle - bound baseball
player, described by his
father as "not the brightest
boy in his class". Never-
theless he is given a partner-
ship in the firm, married,
with a safe future. Neil is
invited to the wedding which
is followed by a great feast
and dance, where all
Brenda's rich relations gorge
themselves and gradually
drink themselves into a stu-
por. During the festivities,
Brenda's father takes her to
one side and tells her how
happy he is that he has such
a reliable daughter, and how
sorry he is for all the parents
who cannot trust their
children. Already Neil and
she are growing apart from
each other, her departure to
University and his return to
work only deepens the rift
between them.
The basic theme of the
film is the conflict between
the girl's natural love for
her parents and close-knit
family life and her attraction
to Neil, the freeman. She
has been brought up to
believe money and advance-
ment are everything, and dis-
covers that Neil's freedom
sets him apart from her
world and way of life, while
Neil sees his life more and
more in the light of growing
insecurity.
Also worth seeing in Lon-
don is Targets, a supporting
film, again from America,
again about the American
way of life, or death, to be
more accurate. Some parts of
the plot are cliched but the
insight the film provides into
the American preoccupation
with guns and their right to
carry them makes it well
worth the money. The plot
concerns a young psychopath
who, after murdering his
wife and mother, sets off
with a bag filled with guns
and ammunition, determined
to kill as many as possible
before being caught. His last
act is to climb up behind
the film screen at a drive-in
movie, poke a hole in the
canvas and try and pick off
as many of the audience as
possible with a rifle.
It's good for a laugh if
nothing else.
An Age, by Brian Aldiss,
is a novel about time and
people. Publishers are
Sphere Books, price 5/-.
Loosely termed as science-
fiction, this book concerns
one Edward Bush, an artist
whose psychological hang-
ups are quickly revealed to
the reader. Part of the novel
is set in the future about a
century hence, in a Britain
on the edge of bankruptcy.
Someone has discovered a
drug which gives anyone who
uses it the ability to "mind
travel" into the far past, the
Devonian, Cambrian and
Jurassic eras. The book is
sprinkled with scientific
details concerning the con-
ditions connected with such
travelling, but these are aside
from the main theme, which
is the nature of time itself.
The mind travellers exist as
ghosts in the desolate wastes
of the earth before man
ever existed; most of them
are rich social drop-outs;
but others are working for
the Institute, an organisation
first set up for scientific re-
search but later dedicated to
more sinister purposes. There
are a lot of faults in the
plot, which are admittedly
difficult to avoid given such
a complicated setting in
time and space, but the
quality of Mr. Aldiss'
writing is evident in the
beautifully descriptive
passages set in the half-world
of the past, and, in sharp
contrast, his vision of a
totalitarian British Isles
where freedom has dis-
appeared and martial law
prevails.
His prose often reads like
poetry, and it is easy to
become confused with the
course of the action, but An
Age is worth persevering
with for the questions posed
by its ending. It's also a very
enjoyable way of spending
an evening instead of watch-
ing the box.
In a totally different vein,
Signet and Mentor books
are soon to be turning out
three of Isaac Asimov's
science books called Under-
standing Physics. These are
written for the layman and
Dr. Asimov has laid all the
emphasis on making his
style as clear as possible.
Not for the enthusiastic
Physics or Engineering
student, but they make very
useful gifts for the unscien-
tific friend, or for Maths
students like me who could
never understand the subject.
They cost 8/6 each and are
published this Autumn.
