<One... important aspect of the physicist's work... concerns the design of
apparatus to carry out the many special measurements for which no commercial
equipment exists. For example, this has involved the design and construction
of mass spectrometers, and more and more instruments of various kinds are
being developed not only to measure a property continuously, but to use this
measurement for control of a manufacturing process. Obviously, for small
manufacturing units instrumentation will tend to be simple and robust, but for
large-scale continuous manufacture, representing turn-over values of many
millions of pounds per annum, much more sophisticated methods are feasible.
H e r e . . . the physicist will find himself,
in collaboration with colleagues with
different training and interests, using
the most powerful ancillary techniques,
such as digital computers .. .9
