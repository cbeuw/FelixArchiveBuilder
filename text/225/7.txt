UNIVERSITY IN THE LIMELIGHT
- A LOOK AT SUSSEX
One of the nearer Universities to London
is Sussex. Perhaps the most expensive
university that we have for the number of
people involved. Since its conception it
has been rarely out of the news. A fuss
was caused when the (Brighton Town'
Planning Committee rejected Sir Basil
Spence's plan for a chapel or meeting
house, because it did not fit in with the rest
of his plans. Recently the Sunday Tele-
graph joined in the campaign started by
the Daily Mail to present the image of
the Sussex student as a sex-mad, orgy-
loving creature.

L a s t W e d n e s d a y I w e n t d o w n there to find

of t h e m . It is i m p o s s i b l e t o b u y a cigarette a n y -
w h e r e i n t h e grounds a n d t h e girl's h a l l c f r ? -

on these points a m e m b e r of their U n i o n C o u n c i l

L o n d o n that not m o r e than three p e o p l e w e r e to
b e i n a student's r o o m together a n d that ac least
t w o of these must b e of the same sex.
If I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e can b e thought of as a vertic-
al structure then Sussex is most definitely h o r i -
zontal. D e s i g n e d b y S i r B a s i l Spence, the
architect b e h i n d the r e b u i l d i n g of C o v e n t r y
C a t h e d r a l , the pattern of the b u i l d i n g s i s one of
arches. T h e U n i o n b u i l d i n g K k e most of the
others, consists of large n u m b e r s of arches of
different size a n d shape b a l a n c e d o n top of e a c h
other. T o g e t h e r w i t h its enigmatic E p s t e i n a n d
rectangular ponds its lies i n t h e centre of t h e
U n i v e r s i t y C a m p u s . N o n e of t h e b u i l d i n g s is
m o r e t h a n about three storeys h i g h w h i c h gives
a general i m p r e s s i o n of spaciousness.
Life in the Hotels
So f a r three halls c f residence h a v e been b u i l t
to house a s m a l l p a r t of t h e three t h o u s a n d
students. O n e is b e i n g used as t e m p o r a r y a c -
c o m o d a t i o n f o r part of t h e Arts F a c u l t y a n d so
there is one h a l l for m e n a n d another for w o m e n .
This, means that t h e majority of students have to
live i n t h e t o w n of B r i g h t o n , four miles a w a y
a n d a t e n p e n n y b u s journey. M o s t of t h e m a r e
p u t u p i n hotels a n d guest houses i n t h e t o w n for
w h i c h they p a y a standardised rent of four pounds
t w o shillings a w e e k w h i c h is d e d u c t e d f r o m
m a i n t e n a n c e grants before the grant is given t o
the student. N o t i c e s o n t h e w a l l i n one of the
H a l l s of Residence r e m i n d e d students that they
w o u l d "be subject t o d i s c i p l i n a r y action i f they
left before the e n d of the year, or w e n t a w a y
f r o m their room for the night w i t h o u t permission
of their tutor. T h i s also applies to students l i v i n g
i n hotels.
Stainless Steel Art
T h e r e is only one refectory i n the p l a c e w h i c h ,
I w a s tofd. gets v e r y c r o u d e d at l u n c h t i m e . I n
the e v e n i n g i t w a s p r o v i d i n g a service v e r y
similar to ours w i t h prices w h i c h are slightly
h i g h e r than even M o o n e y ' s n e w ones. T h e food,
h o w e v e r was v e r y m u c h better cooked than w e
get, t h e soup w a s n o m e r e apology as it is here
b u t was a f u l l - b o d i e d W i n d s o r for s.evenpence.
In t h e refectory, as i n t h e rest of the U n i v e r s i t y ,
large paintings stared d o w n at y o u . T h e s e w e i r d
a n d o d d m o d e m w o r k s a d o r n every w a l l that is
not either set w i t h flint or fancy b r i c k , most are
paintings b u t there is o n e w a l l covered w i t h giant
stainless steel creations. T h e r e is also a snack
bar w h i c h serves dishes m u c h the same as our top
refectory a n d t h e charges are the same.
