H A V E Y O U ever thought
about how difficult it is to write
a column called "Mainly for
Women" which is going to be
read by about twenty times
more men than women. In fact
it is so difficult we are going
to rely on your suggestions.
W e t a k e i t y o u don't w a n t u s to
vvrite about fashion because this is
a matter of personal taste. U n l i k e
the n a t i o n a l w o m e n journalists, w e
cannot w r i t e about famous' w o m e n
because w e feel the c o l u m n w o u l d ,
jusjt r e m a i n u n r e a d , (and a n y w a y
w e don't k n o w any famous w o m e n
to w r i t e about). Y o u don't w a n t to
k n o w yet another " b a k e d b e a n s "
recipe. Y o u are either f e d b y l a n d -
l a d y , M o o n e y or y o u choose y o u r
o w n menus a n l y o u a l l seem to have
s u r v i v e d at least one t e r m , so w e
trust y o u are a l l c o p i n g w i t h y o u r
o w n menus a n d y o u a l l seem to h i v e
N o t b e i n g housewives, w e feel a
h o m e m a k i n g c o l u m n w o u l d be of
little interest to y o u .
It seems to us that the best r e d
articles i n w o m e n ' s magazines are
the " a g o n y " c o l u m n , the horoscopes,
a n d , moss frequently, t h e letters. W e
feel that letters f r o m y o u w o u l d be
a great help. W e don't w a n t to w r i t e
a c o l u m n w h i c h w o n ' t interest y o n ,
so c a n w e h a v e y o u r ideas please ?

INSURANCE
AND THE STUDENT
A S A S T U D E N T you are
probably painfully aware(
of the numerous Insurance)
circulars that you receive, and
I am equally aware that most)
of these circulars end up in the
waste paper basket, unread.
Being inundated with these
circulars has caused the Student
to be sceptical about Insurance.

T T H E w h o l e b r e a d t h of techno-
* l o g i c a l e d u c a t i o n was discussed
i n the various sessions of the
seminar d u r i n g the week. T h e topics
r a n g e d f r o m technological education
in schools to the possibilities of post-
graduate degrees b e i n g a w a r d e d for
w o r k c a r r i e d out i n Industry.
T h e first m a i n difference that
e m e r g e d b e t w e e n t h e system i n
B r i t a i n a n d that of most C o n t i n e n t a l
countries was i n specialisation. I n
this country specialisation begins
m u c h earlier i n school courses t h a n
o n the C o n t i n e n t . A l l i e d to this is
the fact that i n general it takes 5-7
years to g a i n a degree, w h i c h is
considered e q u i v a l e n t to t h e M . S c ,
the first t w o years solely for
d i e • t e a c h i n g of basic scientific
subjects. T h i s results i n E n g i n e e r s
b e i n g p r o d u c e d at the age of 2 5 or
or 26, as o p p o s e d to 21 or 22 i n this
country, obviously r e d u c i n g the
a m o u n t of scientific m a n - p o w e r
a v a i l a b l e to a country's e c o n o m y .
Because of the shorter time spent
at U n i v e r s i t y b v B r i t i s h students, i t
is possible for the majority of t h e m
to receive m a i n t a i n a n c e Brants. T h i s

C o m m i t t e e are m u c h e n v i e d b y
C o n t i n e n t a l students.
British courses lack freedom
T h e impression g a i n e d by toe
c o n t i n e n t a l delegates is that o u r
technological institutes are machines
f o r p r o d u c i n g h i g h l y s p e c i a l i s e d
technologists i n the shortest possible
t i m e w i t h s,tate-provided comforts, to
m a k e the short intensive passage
m o r e pleasant. O u r system was m u c h
criticised f o r the l a c k of a c a d e m i c
freedom, r e g a r d i n g c h o i c e of lecture
courses a n d our inability to choose
w h e n w e s h o u l d present ourselves
for examination.
Student representation
A n i m p o r t a n t feature of t h e c o n -
t i n e n t a l system is that students are
represented at t h e highest levels of
t h e B o a r d s of Studies - a n d opinions
of students are listened to i n respect
to t h e choice a n d content of courses.
A t I . C . there are a c a d e m i c s u b - c o m -
mittees w h i c h attempt to cater for
this necessary student o p i n i o n on the
content of courses, b u t i t m u s t b e
r e m e m b e r e d that these committees
are separate f r o m the bodies w h i c h
a c t u a l l y govern a student's progress.

Vacation training
T h e r e was a S u r p r i s i n g difference
i n the a t t i t u d e of the f o r e i e n delegat-
ions to Industry. M o s t of the c o n -
t i n e n t a l delegates initially expressed
the opinion, that industrial experience

a d m i t t e d that s u c h experience was
useful i n b r o a d e n i n g the outlook of
a student straight f r o m school, b u t
i t was still m a i n t a i n e d that the
t e c h n i c a l k n o w l e d g e o b t a i n e d h a d
v e r y little to d o w i t h technological
studies. It appears that most of the
output f r o m t e c h n i c a l universities on
the C o n t i n e n t is e m p l o y e d i n R e -
search a n d D e v e l o p m e n t .
Language Laboratories
A feature observable f r o m the ex-
cellent E n g l i s h spoken b y a l l t'te
foreign delegates, is that it is c o n -
s i d e r e d essential for students of
science a n d technology o n the c o n -
tinent to h a v e a g o o d k n o w l e d g e of
at !e«st one f o r e i g n language. C o n -
siderable use is m a d e of language
