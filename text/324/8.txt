Government cut-back in
Higher Education condemned
The Universities' Specialist Conference at Sheffield on January
5th—7th voted to black the introduction of the Diploma of Higher
Education (Dip HE) award which was outlined in the recent Govern-
ment White Paper on Education (reported in last week's FELIX).
The motion on the White
Paper said that it was can-
sidered that the introduc-
tion of this two-year course
requiring University en-
trance qualifications (5
G C E s , 2 at A-level) was
simply a move to reduce
student numbers, since it
would become a substitute
for existing three-year
courses.
The Motion, which has
been prioritised for discus-
sion at the N U S National
Conference at Exeter in
A p r i l , also condemns the
cutback in projected stud-
ent numbers for 1981 from
835,000 to 750,000 and the
increase in the student:
staff ratio of 10:1. The
conference regarded the
posing of different parts of
the education system
against each other as
"short sighted and educa-
tionally disastrous", and
condemned the Govern-
ment for paying little at-
tention to education while
they were increasing the
defence budget, for exam-
ple, by 10 per cent.
Other motions discussed
and carried included ones
on Catering, Binary Sport
and a Space Advertising
Agency. The catering mo-
tion affirmed that "the
fight to reduce catering
prices is part of the
Union's general policy of
fighting for a grant i n -
crease". Conference de-
plored the Universities'
Grants Committee ( U G C )
policy of making catering
self-balancing, said that
bar profits should not be
used to subsidise refector-
ies.
Conference recognised
that the binary .system ex-
tends to sport in the Bin-
ary Sport motion. They
welcomed the decision of
the British Committee for
Student Sport to form a
unified organisation for
student sport.
Bristol University, at
last gaining a n opportun-
ity to put forward their
regular motion on space
advertising agencies (the
agancies that persuade
companies to advertise i n
union publications, e.g.
"Felix") accused these of
"gross profiteering", and
conference voted that the
Universities'
Specialist
Conference
The University's Specialist Conference i s as
its name implies, a m i n i - N U S Conference about
university affairs and attended exclusively by dele-
gates of university unions. T h e most recent was
held at R a n m o o r House, a hall-of-residence-
plus, at Sheffield University on Friday—Sunday,
5th—7th January. Rather more than 100 dele-
gates attended from Britain's 44 universities, i n -
cluding five from Imperial: R o b Armitage, Charles
Dingley, Trcv Phillips, M a l c o l m Matthews and
. Piers Corbyn turned up
too to lend his voice and that of the I M G to the
proceedings, a n d with yours truly there to report
the jamboree, Imperial was probably the best-
represented College there.
The Universities' Specialist is one of several
specialist conferences run every year by the N U S
for different sectors of higher and further educa-
tion which report back to the national conferences
in December and A p r i l .
Impressive for the efficiency with which discus-
sions were held and motions passed, most dele-
gates thought the conference very worthwhile—as
well as an excellent excuse for a few frolics in
stainless* surroundings.
*a reference to steel.
N U S Exec should investi-
gate the possibility of set-
ting up their own non-
profit making agency.
A major feature of the
conference was the way it
was split up for part of
the time into discussion
groups on various topics,
including Trade Unions
and Universities, N U S
Areas and Universities,
H a l l Fees and Catering
charges, Representation,
the Environment and Stu-
dent Community Action,
the E.E.C.. Vietnam and
South Africa. Most of
these groups put motions
forward to the whole con-
ference, and they were a l l
passed.
Dr. R. Hunter, Vice-
Chancellor of Birmingham
University, spoke to the
conference, supposedly on
the subject of "University
Autonomy", but was eith-
er deliberately evasive or
knew little. A n inconse-
quential speech was fol-
lowed by an hour's ques-
tions, and the delegates'
tempers frayed rapidly at
the seemingly endless re-
plies of " n o comment" or
"I don't know".
A b o u t the only coherent
facts to appear from this
session was the reiteration
of D r . Hunter's opinions
on representation: that stu-
dents should play as full a
part as possible in univer-
sity affairs, but must not
play any part i n decisions
on the appointment or sal-
aries of staff or the aca-
demic assessment of stu-
dents!

Well, at least we have a grants policy!
N o rent strike and not much in the way
df suggestions as to what else we should
actually do to get the much needed i n -
crease, but at least we have a start —
what I.C. students actually want: the
interim increase of £65, an annual re-
view based o n the student cost index
and a big fight at N U S conference on
the £100 increase, abolition of the means
test and the post-graduate demands for
an extra grant for London, the " L o n d o n
weighting" (Everyone except P C ' s gets
more money for living i n London).
A n increase for postgraduates and
an end to the means test are N U S policy
— it's up to us to see that N U S as a
whole pushes for these demands and
that Will not happen unless I C is very
active i n the rest of the grants cam-
paign. F o r instance I C is over one-third
postgraduates. Unless the union gets
them organised and active we can
hardly expect the Government to listen
to the N U S claim on their behalf. A l -
though the election of P G Affairs Offi-
cer has been postponed (there are quite
a number of my fellow P C s getting i n -
volved and there is no reason why a P G
affairs committee could not start to
function almost immediately.
Also if we hope to convince delegates
from o'ther universities at N U S confer-
ence that our more militant demands
are serious, we must explain to them
the reasons why I.C. let them down over
the national rent strike. W e must not get
the reputation of being talkers and not
doers!
Why N o Rent Strike?
One reason I must say was a tactical
error on m y part. T h e withdrawal of the
new halls levy should have been dis-
cussed, at length, separately. O n Thurs-
day it just confused the issue.
But more important is the bread and
butter one that students in hall have
comparatively low rents and I failed to
convince them that they should look to
the future or assist their fellow students
or even help themselves for next year.
I think also we have failed to realise
that no matter h o w eloquent a case the
Rector may make for us to the Govern-
ment the simple fact of I C students be-
ing on a mass rent strike would have re-
vealed far better our determination to
put a n end to the drop i n our standard
of living.
W e will be trying to enlist the Rec-
tor's support for our case of course. B u t
I can't see that bis humble plea on our
behalf will carry anything like as much
weight as those vice-chancellors facing
rent strikes and refectory boycotts. B u t
every drop counts, of course.
A n d now on t o brighter things, cast off
this gloomy spell and on to the idyllic
surroundings of happier regions of I C —

I haven't eaten i n Mooney all week
owing to writing bumph sheets, speeches,
President's Pieces and attending U G M s
(Also my grant/pay isn't through yet).
I've almost forgotten what " i t ' s " like!
However, it was rather disturbing to
hear at the Refectory Committee that
nothing had been done on the problem
of hygiene and cockroaches since the
previous meeting. Admittedly this was
the holiday period and a steam cleaning
machine had broken down, but as I said
before the holidays, the situation needs
to be watched carefully.
Ents.
D u e to some mess a n d damage at a
few concerts last term, the College has
asked the union to consider its enter-
tainments policy. D o we want really big
concerts weekly, letting i n a very big
proportion of non-students to subsidise
our own students? A r e too few students
interested to make it worthwhile? O r
do you like the set up as it is?
Democratic decisions need a n i n -
formed discussion and the sooner we
hear your views the batter.
'1 can do anyfink'
G u i t a r i s t p r o v e s w i l d c l a i m in public
at Ents C o n c e r t
The Great H a l l was packed, as always,
for the concert last Saturday. Strawbs
have now turned more towards the rock
side of music since the replacement of
lead guitarist Tony Hooper by Dave
Lambert, whose guitar work was crystal
clear at most times. Their set contained
several of their more recently written
material, including their two recent
singles " L a y D o w n " and "Part of the
U n i o n " , presumably both of which will
be on their forthcoming album "Burst-
ing at the Seams".
Their old material was not forgotten,
however, and no Strawbs concert would
be complete without the classic " H a n g -
man and the Papist". When introducing
this Dave Cousins became serious for
once, giving a short voicing of his opin-
ions on war, otherwise there tended to
be longish gaps i n between numbers
while he told rather humorous anecdotes.
Dave Lambert continued with the com-
edian role, when it came to his solo
spot. Rather unexpectedly, he played
" T h e W i l l i a m Tell Overture" by slapping
his cheeks and holding his open mouth
to the microphone, followed by "I C a n
D o Anyfink", which he dedicated to a l l
skin heads.
They also performed several of the
stronger tracks from their "Grave N e w
W o r l d " album, including the title track
which they used to open their set, pro-
ducing a very full sound, each musician
blending together nicely, with some very
good keyboard play from Blue Weav-
er. The acoustic piece was played by
John F o r d and Richard Hudson, who
moved from bass guitar and drums to
acoustic guitars.
The supporting group, Wheels, con-
sisted of three guitarists, a bassist and a
drummer. Their set tended to lack suffi-
cient substance, though they did produce
a few good tunes, notably their last
number which stood out from their more
usual melodic sound.
