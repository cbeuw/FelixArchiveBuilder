Comparing this performance with
that of a year ago, Canterbury Tales,
unlike H a i r , has remained unchanged, if
not slightly improved. T h e cast shows
no signs of fatigue or perfunctory per-
formance; it is as lively as last year.
Superficially, the show entails a series
of sketches more-or-less based on
Chaucer: bawdy beautiful (Pun). If a l l
you want is an evening of good enter-
tainment, enough said. However, there
is a more subtle story underlying the
tales, requiring careful attention, and re-
tention of the sketches.
T h e opening starts with a banging "1
have a noble c o c k ! " (Yanks will catch
this), goes through various stages of
sexual relationships to end by answer-
ing (correctly, I thought) the question
" W h a t d o women most desire?" A bit
melodramatic — perhaps daunting —
but it leaves one thinking, as every good
play should.
W e l l worth a visit, even if the music
does drown some songs, (an unfortun-
ate indictment against every musical
I've seen i n London) the worst case be-
ing the beautifully haunting " L o v e W i l l
Conquer A H " . It's performed twice a
show, making it four tries — I've yet to
hear it, even though sitting i n a £1.50
Stalls or £1.50 Dress Circle seat.
But one need not pay a pound; early
performances a n d student groups of any
size have reductions. M y ticket each
time was 25p for the £1.50 seat.
I recommend a visit — except Chau-
cer addicts, w h o may not recognise it.
It's at the Phoenix Theatre, Charing
Cross Road, one with reasonable acous-
tics.

"Fear and Loathing in L a s Vegas"
by Hunter S. Thompson (Paladin, 40p)
"The American Dream is something
that most of us are probably not look-
ing for, unlike N i x o n a n d Agnew": yet
M r . Thompson presents a good take-off
of this very subject i n his latest book.
The story starts with our heroes some-
where around Barstow, o n the edge of
the desert. When the drugs take hold, a
voice was screaming " H o l y Jesus! What
are these goddam animals?"
Then it was quiet again.
The attorney had taken his shirt off
and was pouring beer on his chest to
facilitate the tanning process a n d so
on . . . across the desert at frightening
speed.
N o t having tried out most of the
drugs used i n the book, I felt a little
left out of the story. Even so, one can
still imagine the "perilous drug-enlivened
confrontations with casino operators,
bartenders, police officers with a special
interest i n the narcotics problem and
other representatives of the silent major-
ity who have a hallucinatory humour
and nightmare terror rarely seen o n the
printed page."
The book is very "interestingly" illu-
strated with drawings by R a l p h Stend-
man hitched from 'Rolling Stone'. I say
"interestingly" as I found the drawings
of the characters grotesque a n d quite
horrifying—but perhaps that's what it's
all about.
Hunter Thompson is an unusual and
refreshing writer who contributes regu-
larly to such unlikely publications as
the New York Times Magazine, Ram-
parts, and, of course, Rolling Stone.
Thompson's most famous book is prob-
ably "Hell's Angels", and it is easy t o
see a resemblance i n "Fear and Loathing
in L a s Vegas".
T h e whole book tends to boil down to
a mad, corrosive piece of prose poetry
going, where who knows, but certainly
going. The N Y T claims that it picks up
where Norman Mailer leaves off. I don't
think that that is a very good compari-
son, as Mailer certainly gets more out
of his writing than Hunter.
I enjoyed m y savage journey to the
Heart of the American Dream—but I'm
glad I bought the return ticket.
