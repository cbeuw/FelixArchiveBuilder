- but spirits boycott
continues
There has been controversy over the case of the
thalidomide victims for quite some time now, and on
Friday, 5th January the Distillers Company Limited
made an offer of twenty million pounds, to be paid over
a period of ten years, to the thalidomide victims, with
this an immediate cash payment of £50,000 to the
parents. This offer has come about mainly as a result
of the pressure applied by Prudential Insurance. T h e
leader of the parents involved, David Mason, has not
as yet commented on the offer.
Following a vote by an I C U G M to boycott D C L
products, the College Refectory Committee have show-
ed their sympathy with those concerned by agreeing
not to stock any spirits from Distillers i n their bars.
A s a result of this decision they have replaced them
with other brands, and now there should be no Distil-
lers' stocks remaining.
O n the subject John Lane said last Thursday at the
Union meeting that the boycott should continue until
the parents have finally accepted an offer.
The matter continues.

THE BASICS OF LIFE
ASSURANCE EXPLAINED
Life A s s u r a n c e is basic-
ally a very simple subject
and the purpose of this
article is to give a quick
thumbnail sketch of the
main principles involved.
There are three types of
insurance cover:
W h o l e L i f e — E n d o w m e n t
— T e r m
W h o l e Life A s s u r a n c e is
what it says. T h e cover
is on a person's life u n -
til he dies.
Endowment A s s u r a n c e :
Here a term of years is
selected by the buyer. If
he survives that term, he
collects his money.
S h o u l d he die within the
stipulated period, the
S u m A s s u r e d is paid out
to his dependants.
T e r m A s s u r a n c e : This is
the very cheapest form
of Life A s s u r a n c e . A per-
son takes out a policy to
cover himself for a per-
iod of years. S h o u l d he
die within that period
the full amount of the
S u m A s s u r e d w o u l d be
payable to his depen-
dants. If, however, he
survived, he gets nothing
at all except the satisfac-
tion of knowing he h a d
bought a term of protec-
tion at a very low cost.
W i t h a n d W i t h o u t Profit
Policies
On both W h o l e Life a n d
Endowment A s s u r a n c e ,
the prospective buyer
can elect to have his
policy with or without
profits.
Examples:
(a) A m a n decides to
take out a without-profits
policy for £2,000 S u m
A s s u r e d . S h o u l d he live
or die that exact amount
is what someone w o u l d
eventually receive.
(b) If, however, the same
man h a d d e c i d e d on a
£2,000 s u m A s s u r e d
with profits policy, he
will share in the profits
made by his chosen
company on their invest-
ments. The top compan-
ies over a 25-year period
paid out in 1 9 7 0 a return
of 7 % per annum net to
their policy holders. The
true returns are actually
higher than this. Life
A s s u r a n c e premiums
qualify for income tax
relief; this is n o w worth
1 5 % of the premium for
a standard rate taxpayer.
These kinds of return are
a very impressive invest-
ment.
The most important
thing to bear i'n m i n d on
a with-profit policy is the
enormous difference be-
tween the Life A s s u r a n c e
companies. For instance,
a m a n starting a w i t h -
profit policy in 1 9 4 5 at
aged 2 9 paying £50 a
year w o u l d have receiv-
ed in 1 9 7 0 £3,183 from
the top company a n d
£1,899 from one at the
other e n d of the scale.
Do ensure that y o u
obtain good impartial a d -
vice from a reputable
broker, preferably one
w h o is either a member
of the Corporation or the
A s s o c i a t i o n of Insurance
Brokers.
Unit Trusts
The last decade has
seen the introduction of
another type of insurance
linked with investment.
Unit Trusts enjoyed a
boom period in the S i x -
ties, w h e n the Stock
Market w a s generally
buoyant. W i t h this type
of contract, the c o m p a n -
ies invest your premiums
on the stock exchange
and several Unit Trust
groups have recorded
very impressive captital
gains for their clients.
One must remember,
however, that the Stock
Market c a n go d o w n , as
well as up, but the
growth rate s h o w n in
most c o m p a n i e s ' projec-
tions 5 % — 7 % per
annum net, should be
attainable. O n e well
known Unit Trust has, in
fact, appreciated by 1 8 %
net per a n n u m every year
since its foundation 7
years ago. D o , however,
choose a policy w h i c h
gives y o u freedom to let
your contract run on for
a w h i l e if necessary
after the maturity date,
just in case this date
happens to coincide with
a Stock Market s l u m p .
A g a i n , the advice of a
g o o d qualified broker is
essential.
Life A s s u r a n c e plays
an important part in our
lives. It both protects us
and provides us with a
safe but g o o d investment
and incidentally c a n
prove useful for House
Purchase.
H o u s e Purchase
M o s t discerning m e n
w i s h , eventually, to o w n
their o w n homes. T h e
normal w a y of setting out
to do this is to approach
a B u i l d i n g Society for a
loan. T h e amount they
w i l l lend y o u is normally
three times your annual
salary, but one or two
new schemes have c o m e
out recently in w h i c h the
advance is greater than
this. A s s u m i n g y o u are
accepted for a loan, y o u
w i l l have to repay both
the capital y o u have bor-
rowed, a n d the interest
charged on it, at monthly
intervals.
M o s t young m e n with
responsibilities (wives
and families) protect
this loan w i t h an insur-
ance policy, so that
should the worst happen
his dependants will have
a roof over their heads.
The most advantageous
way of buying a house is
without doubt to have
this insurance cover on
a with-profit basis. This
method is the most ex-
pensive to adopt, but
should be aimed at. Like
everything else in life
one gets what one pays
for.
S u m m a r y
Ironically enough, the
greatest advantage of
Life A s s u r a n c e is derived
by the people w h o begin
at a young age. Their
p r e m i u m payments are
low a n d irrespective of
inflation cannot be i n -
creased, though y o u c a n
bet everything else w i l l .
It also makes sense be-
cause generally the
younger y o u are, the
healthier y o u are. Every
day middle-aged m e n of
poor health are asked to
pay heavily for the Life
A s s u r a n c e cover they
ideally should have h a d
as younger m e n .
W o r t h w h i l e policies
for m e n in their early
twenties c a n start from
as little as £1 per month.
