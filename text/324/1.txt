UGM rejects Rent Strike
New Halls levy to continue
Militant students at Friday's U G M
erupted in uproar when the meeting narrowly
threw out the idea of a rent strike in TC in aid
of the grants campaign.
About 350 students turned up to vote at
the meeting, fifty less than attended Thurs-
day's meeting which had to be adjourned to
Friday.
Starting twelve minutes
late because of the late ar-
rival of the I C U Executive
and general disorganisa-
tion i n the Great H a l l ,
Thursday's meeting really
got under way With M i k e
Terry, National Secretary
of the National U n i o n of
Students, speaking on rent
strikes and the grants
campaign a n d answering
questions from the floor
about them. H e told the
meeting that using the
rent strike weapon: "the
only economic power we
have": was the best way
of forcing the government
to pay students higher
grants.
Strong concern for post-
graduate students was ex-
pressed i n the questions
put to M r . Terry, mainly
focused o n the opinion
that the campaign seemed
to concentrate solely on
increasing undergraduate
grants. M r . Terry said
that this opinion was fall-
acious, and that the cam-
paign was for a n increase
for a l l students. (Our poli-
tical correspondent, how-
ever, points out that it is
significant that little if any
mention of postgraduates
was made at either the
N U S conference at M a r -
gate last November or at
the Campaign Co-ordinat-
ing Committee's first
meeting i n December). A n
amendment to the motion,
passed by a n overwhelm-
ing majority, called for an
immediate £100 increase
in the postgraduate grant
and the restoration of the
London weighting, and
demanded that the N U S
executive should give
these points equal priority
with the other objectives
of the campaign.
Dori Schmetterling then
spoke against the part of
the motion which would
have abolished the 35p
per week new halls levy.
Paul Jowitt, Deputy Presi-
dent, told the meeting that
he was sure that future
generations of students
would look back i n grati-
tude to the meeting a n d
think that "Tin 1973 I C U
acted to get its students a
higher grant, yet banished
them to live i n Wimble-
don". It was further
pointed out that were it
not for the existence of
the levy it would be i m -
possible to finance the
building of the new
North side H a l l .
The paragraph of the
motion calling for the abo-
lition of the levy was
forthwith removed from
the motion by a n amend-
ment that was passed
overwhelmingly.
The m e e t i n g then
moved on to consider am-
endments to the motion.
T o save time the presi-
dent, John Lane, w h o
proposed the substantive
motion, accepted large
parts of these; but consid-
erable time was spent on
the others because Of pro-
tracted speeches from
Piers Corbyn a n d Pete
Gillett.
So long, in fact, that the
meeting had to be a d -
journed at 2.25 until F r i -
day.
Gaining i n inefficiency,
this meeting started a
quarter-of-an-hour late at
1.00, but, fortunately for
the quorum, few left for
lectures at 1.30. The with-
drawal of a motion by
Dave Brown recognising
"that a rent strike i n I m -
perial College would not
achieve any useful pur-
pose a n d only aggravate
public opinion" i n favour
of his speaking against the
substantive, and the rapid
defeat of a Pete Gillett
amendment, meant that
considerable discussion
(by I C U G M standards)
on the substantive was
possible. Major speeches
in favour came from John.
Lane, John Murlis, R o b
Armitage a n d S o n i a
Uochfelder; speeches ag-
ainst came from B i l l Ger-
rard, R o n Marples and
Dave Brown.
The motion was voted
on i n parts (all 14 of
them) and the majority of
it, pledging the backing of
I C U to the demands of
the N U S for higher grants
and a new grants struc-
ture was passed over-
whelmingly.
The decisive moment
came when section F 2 was
arrived at: " I C U resolves
to use the only economic
power we have, the ability
to withhold house a n d
hall rents, to force the col-
lege authorities to put in-
tense pressure o n the Gov-
ernment to concede o u r
c l a i m . "
O n the count, the vote
was:
IN F A V O U R 166
AGAINST 1 7 5
ABSTENTIONS 13
— very close. T h e other
section of the motion re-
ferring to rent strikes was
defeated much more sub-
stantially.
However, a call to form
a rent strike organisation
committee was passed —
this committee will now
co-ordinate the grants
campaign i n I C .
Following the vote, a
militant faction headed by
Piers Corbyn issued a pet-
ition for an E G M to be
held o n Thursday, the
1.8th. T h e text of the
statement is reproduced
in the box on this page.
The Petition
C A L L F O R A N E M E R G E N C Y G E N E R A L
M E E T I N G
" T h u r s d a y ' s 5 5 0 strong U G M voted for a n
amendment w h i c h s a i d : " T h e d e m a n d s o f the
rent strike apart from the points w h i c h a r e
part of the N U S campaign to be: i . . . , i i . . . ,
iii . . . , iv . . .
T h i s amendment — carried after a debate a n d
vote by a substantial majority — assumes
there is to b e a rent strike.
A n issue once voted o n cannot b e voted o n a
s e c o n d time at a n adjourned meeting. W e a l l
k n o w that.
So the chairman of the smaller 3 5 4 strong a d -
journed U G M o n Friday w a s out of order to
put to t h e vote sections of t h e motion c o n -
cerned w i t h whether the rent strike w o u l d take
place.
The voting after a lot of time wasting therefore
of 1 6 6 for a rent strike a n d 1 7 5 against, 1 3
abstaining, w a s null a n d v o i d .
Especially since there w a s only 9 in it!
T h e rest of t h e motion supporting the grants
campaign w a s passed almost unanimously.
C a n a smaller adjourned meeting overturn the
d e c i s i o n o f a larger meeting? O f course notM
T h e only fair solution is to rediscuss the m o -
tion a s a m e n d e d s o far at a n E G M .
W e therefore call o n the President to organise
an E G M o n Thursday, January 1 8 , at 1.00 p.m.
in the Great H a l l . M e a n w h i l e don't p a y your
Hall Bill.
S i g n this Petition. G e t your friends to s i g n .
Return to the U n i o n Office."
