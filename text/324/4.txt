Letters
Rent Strikes ;
losing public sympathy?
Sir,
I write this letter as storm-
clouds are gathering for
Thursday's U.G.M. over the
'rent-strike' issue, and in par-
tial anticipation of the deci-
sion to be reached.
Firstly, I agree that stu-
dent grants have, once
again, become inadequate, es-
pecially to those people in
flats, digs, etc. However, I
think that the action of with-
holding hall and student-
house fees would not achieve
its purpose.
Point 1. In the "campaign"
aims, listed on the bumph-
sheet distributed to Hall
residents, is to "win public
support."
This will probably sound
'old-hat', but to, once again,
put up the 'revolutionary
students' image, although it
might appeal to those of us
with more extreme views, will
certainly not "win public sup-
port". We have only to re-
member the Stirling affair
last year, which cost the stu-
dent cause thousands, to
realise that the same thing is
likely to occur if rents are
withheld. At the moment the
public are bored with student
demonstrations.
Although the Union might
consider that they are not out
to cause such strife, surely
they must realise that if they
got to work on the public
rather than the authorities
they might produce better re-
sults.
I see no logical reason
why the withholding of rents
should do anything towards
getting grants increased—in
fact quite the reverse. I hope
that I am proved incorrect for
the sake of next year's grant
earners.
Yours, etc.,
R. C. WOODWARD,
Chem. 3.

Cutting
the
cleaners
Sir,
I agree wholeheartedly
with Tim Bradbury's remarks
in last week's edition of
Felix. After all, we already
have a million unemployed:
a few more on the scrapheap
would not really be noticed,
would it? Also, since a great
number of the women invol-
ved are widows or have sick
husbands to keep, let us
follow the trend of this pre-
sent heartless society, Tim,
the most needy must be the
first to go. What I would also
suggest is that if you are
prepared to clean your own
room, why not also maintain
the buildings, deliver your
own mail, keep the sports
centre clean, cook your own
meals, and serve your own
drinks. Just think, this would
reduce the staff by several
hundreds. Who knows? Such
reductions might not only
keep the halls fees stable but
may even reduce them.
Therefore, Tim, why don't the
Students' Union and the
trade unions in I.C. get to-
gether on this. Who knows,
perhaps one day you will
become a Tory M.P. and even
be knighted for services to
the country.
Yours sincerely,
RON PARKER
(Be it Hall Messenger and
Sometimes N.U.P.E. Shop-
Steward).
'Cancerous
growths'
Dear Oily,
This is a letter for printing
in Felix.
I am dismayed to find that
the articles I write for Felix
—MARTIN'S BIT for ex-
ample—often seem to have
suffered from cancerous
growths. I refer to the nause-
ating practice of amending
articles without the know-
ledge or consent of the
author.
I respectfully remind you
of your obligations:— "to re-
port and provide independent
comment on Union affairs, to
publicise future Union and
College activities and to pro-
vide articles of general in-
terest or of inoffensive enter-
tainment value". (Felix con-
stitution),—my underlining.
I hope that you will let me
see the form of this letter
after you have castrated it
before publishing.
You are Sir, the Union's
obedient servant.
MARTIN C. BLACK
Entertainment
= Vandalism?
"...an experiment in plotless absurdity and formal
playfulness on the order of Duck Soup, The Big Sleep
or A Woman is a Woman.:, fames Ivory's first american
film displays a sheer precocious love for what
movies can 'say' that I haven't seen since the
films of this early New Wave."

F o r T i m e s of S h o w i n g s e e N a t i o n a l P r e s s
When m y future biographers finally
get around to analysing m y intriguing
literary style, I think ithat they will be
mystified. " C o u l d it be," I can imagine
their saying "that there is here an abso-
lutely unique style in Twentieth Cen-
tury Literature? Is ithis m a n the true
descendant of Shakespeare and Swift?
The heir of the golden styles of Jonson
and Surtees?"
The answer (lest I stray from this in-
depth film review), of course, is that my
reading at school was totally dominated
by Charles Dickens and Alistair M a c -
lean. So, despite the dreadfulness that
the film-makers made of the "Ice Station
Z e b r a " and "When Eight Bells T o l l , "
1 was compulsively drawn to "Fear is
the K e y " (all over the place). I will say
right from Hhe beginning, that the film
was immensely pleasing, and is one of
the best thrillers for a long time.
There are the usual components—an
excellent car-chase, a few bouts of fisti-
cuffs—ibut the real strength of the film
lies in its clever adaptation of the
original plotting. A l l Maclean stories are
very involved with niggers abounding in
wood-piles, but this has been neatly
handled and the two people with me
(neither of whom knew the book) were
not mystified at all. Light entertainment
but fun
/ feel I must write to you
about the behaviour of some
certain people last Saturday
night. I am referring to the
vandalism that occurred in
the toilets at the Strawbs
concert. It is a great shame
that the entertainment pro-
vided cannot be enjoyed by
all, but there is no need at
all for the odd few out to
spoil the enjoyment of
everyone else by such be-
haviour. This action, as heard
by all present, forces the
Ents committee to think care-
fully about future concerts,
and it would be catastrophic,
if, after obtaining such fine
bands, they should have to
cancel any. I just wish that
the people involved show a
little more consideration for
others in future.
Yours faithfully,
