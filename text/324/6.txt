"And what has
King's that I.C.
has not tool"*
Well, they've got a n Arts Festival for a start.
King's College U n i o n have asked F E L I X to tell you
about their Arts Festival, which begins tomorrow and
continues until Saturday week. Eighteen events, timed
both at lunchtimes a n d evenings, are packed into the
ten-day festival, ranging from T o m and Jerry cartoons
through poetry recitals to films and a brass band. None
of the events will cost y o u more than 30p entrance, and
many are free. Even were y o u to go to every event
it would only cost y o u £2—and those of y o u w h o do
can buy a season ticket for £1. A double ticket to both
Wednesday night concerts—the Sutherland Brothers
o n the 17th and Renaissance o n the 24th—will cost
you 50p.
W e have printed the events i n the coming week i n
