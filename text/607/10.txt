It is rare that a place like IC gets a chance to
host the debut gig of an important new band,
and even rarer for a band of the quality of
Weekend. It's a pity, then, that more IC
students didn't turn up on Wednesday night;
ilthough there was a reasonable crowd, a fair
.roportion of these were outsiders.
The last thing Weekend want is to be
compared to the Young Marble Giants,
although with two-thirds of that band being
featured in Weekend they may have some
difficulty in avoiding it at first. Alison Statton's
vocals are as sublime as ever â€” more
confident if anything. She certainly seems
much more self-assured and relaxed on stage
than she used to be. The lead guitarist plays in
a beautiful melodic style, largely African
influenced, which blends nicely with the vocal
line. The use of percussion, addition to drums,
provides a good varied rhythmic background.
Some of the numbers use hams; Harry
Beckett, the trumpet player, is well-known in
jazzy circles, but seems a little misplaced here.
Larry Stafford, on the other hand, blends with
the style of the band very nicely. This is the
more surprising because Larry normally plays
only free form and avant garde jazz.
The band seemed a little tense and
restrained, although with the hype and the
high expectations surrounding them this is
hardly surprising. They played a secret warm
up gig at the Rock Garden a few days
previously, at which they managed to put more
bounce into the music. Hopefully this will
reappear as soon as they settle down to some
regular gigging.
The most apt description of the music would
be melodic and quietly exuberant. Probably
the best compliment paid them was that the
concert was attended and enjoyed by several
people who don't listen to and don't like rock
music. What more can you say?

The H.G. Wells Society will be screening the
fifties science fiction classic Forbidden Planet
on Monday at 7:30pm in the Sutton Lecture
Theatre, Mines Building. The film is based on
Shakespeare's The Tempest and includes a
fine performance by Walter Pidgen as Dr
Moebius, as well as an innovative electronic
sound track. It is notable for the introduction
of Robby the Robot, one of the screen's most
celebrated mechanical inventions.

Last M o n d a y night was the occasion of a
crushing defeat for the W a t e r Polo C l u b at
the hands of Penguin I, a national league
division I team. Despite some aggressive
swimming o n our part, they put away 15
goals to our 3.
T h e following night, however, saw us o n
winning form as we inflicted a 5-3 defeat o n
St Bart's Hospital. This was a somewhat
turbulent match d u r i n g which Last, never
the most subtle of players, was twice sent out
for over-enthusiastic fouling, and Garton was
also removed for rather obvious knuckling of
the opposition.
Leach put about six shots in the general
direction of the Bart's goal (one of them even
went in), but the miss of the match award
went, yet again, to A s h w i n , w h o put an
impressive shot at least live feet over the bar
and almost into the spectator's gallery.
O n the rare occasions when we got our
game together we scored a few goals, which
c a m e from C a r t o n , C a s i n i , A s h w i n a n d
Leach, but i n general, we played a poorly
organised game, and the only remedy for that
is more Fosters.

T h e second team set off again, map and
c o m p a s s i n h a n d u n d e r t h e i n t r e p i d
leadership of the returning collapse-a-capt.
The game started badly with the C h e m
E n g 1 contingent suffering from the previous
e v e n i n g ' s antics i n S t a n ' s . O u r g l o r i o u s
captain inspired us to a 6-3 deficit by half-
time which we attribute to his lovers tiff with
Chris Cole. In a tense and gruelling second
half, M a r k Hudson kicked us back level. M i c k
Windsor then pulled his hamstring and had
to retire leaving Noddy to step into the
breach, p l a y i n g with the grit of a prop
forward, which was pretty unfortunate since
he was meant to be scrum-half. The score
r e m a i n e d e v e n t h o u g h M a r k S i m m o n s
received concussion and a broken jaw i n a
last-ditch tackle, a n d M a r c Hudson just
missed a penalty from our own half.
T i r e d and sleepy we wound our weary way
home, seemingly only days later reching the
comforting lights of toytown and bobos.
^ Hockey
Ladies
H a v i n g discovered that a W O h a d been
declared over St M a r y ' s (League) and that a
'friendly' had been arranged against U C L ,
half the team decided that they didn't want
to play. C a r o l i n e (alias C a p ' n Birdseye)
reckoned that o u r bodies needed exercise,
despite the fact that a few of us have been
'getting it' fairly regularly lately.
Playing with two U C L players, 'cos there
were only eight of us, we managed to score
the first g o a l . C o n t r i b u t i o n s c a m e f r o m
Alison C. (6%), Sara (10%) and K a r e n (84%).
However, Alison later managed to notch up a
hat-trick of misses. Luckily, some of the team
had been to the opticians recently, and this
resulted i n Sara, Alison L . and Alison C .
managing to find the goal with their shots.
After the final score of 5-4 to them, we
retired to the changing rooms. W h e n we
discovered that Caroline was going to have a
shower, the rest of us decided that the quicker
we get to the bar, the better.
