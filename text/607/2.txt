I was horrified to discover
that the I C U nuts themselves,
Messrs Ledwold and M c C a b e ,
have this week accompanied
the R C S U motorised mascot
Jezebel on a five day journey
to Cologne. Does this mean
that their duties as H o n Sec
a n d D e p u t y President are
being totally ignored?
Probably, we shall never
notice the difference and M r
Nick M o r t o n will indeed be
able to say " I haven't seen
them for a week and have
managed quite well without
them."

Dear Mark Smith
O h dear. In his Soapbox
article ( F E L I X 606) on the
Soc Soc's " R a d i c a l " news-
sheet, N . Willson has surely
dropped a clanger. H e criti-
cises the c o m m e n t i n the
Editor's Intro "Please exscuse
(sic) any spelling or gram-
matical erros as we can't all
have a public school educa-
tion ", as " insult(ing)
people who went to a public
school, as if it was their fault?"
(his emphasis). Is it not that
the c o m m e n t criticises the
p u b l i c s c h o o l system (and
rightly so), with its foundation
upon privilege, rather than
people who have gone through
the system? I rather think so.
Perhaps, in future, N . Willson
might learn to understand the
words, r a t h e r t h a n t a k i n g
exception to what he mis-
takenly believes to be written
between the lines.

Dear Mark
N i c k W i l l s o n ' s S o a p b o x
article.,in last week's F E L I X
about Socialist Society was
f a i r l y w e l l r e a s o n e d a n d
thought provoking. In refer-
ence to last term's Soc Soc
newsheet, Radical, he gave
the impression that leftists in
g e n e r a l , a n d S o c S o c i n
particular, are paranoid, self-
obsessed and arrogant. This
may be true, it's hard for me
to be objective. I hope that
anyone who wants to make
t h e i r o w n j u d g e m e n t w i l l
o b t a i n a copy of R a d i c a l ,
either from me or Ian House,
Life Sci 1 (they don't cost
anything).
H o w e v e r , M r W i l l s o n
made several basic errors. His
c l a i m t h a t the a r t i c l e s i n
Radical attack multinational
company directors and right
wing politicians personally, not
the system they have to work
within, is completely false.
Nowhere in the article on
multinationals, for example,
is a company director men-
tioned personally. We are not
unwilling to admit that our
opponents are normal people.
They are caught up in the
system as much as anybody
else; the manager who works
t e n h o u r s a d a y a n d at
weekends in his spare time;
who, because of all his mater-
ial possessions, has more to
w o r r y a b o u t ; who c a n n o t
spend much time with his
c h i l d r e n ; who suffers from
stomach ulcers; who dies just
a few years after retirement....
he too is a victim of capitalism.
It is the system we object to,
and its corruption and des-
truction of human dignity.
I find it strange that M r
Willson should object to the
comment in the Editor's Intro
about public schools, and to
the person who advocated the
"secret candidate" approach
to U n i o n elections (in fact he's
not a member of Soc Soc)
grinning as he put forward
the idea. U s u a l l y it's left
wingers who are accused of
being unable to take a joke!
He says " a cartoon showing
a disgustingly fat white man
(the West) carelessly scatter-
ing crumbs to a starving black
(the developing world) is
going to cause irritation and
r e s e n t m e n t a m o n g p e o p l e
who might be open to per-
s u a s i o n " . I f they see the
cartoon as a personal attack
then they're as paranoid as we
a r e . I f t h e y b e l i e v e the
cartoon is untrue or unfair,
then I accept that we should
be arguing our case at a more
basic level.
Socialist Society attempts
to influence people's attitudes,
generally by advertising what
we see to be the truth. If we
b e c o m e a r r o g a n t , t h e n I
would welcome criticism to
that effect, but we will not
betray our ideals merely to
get more popular support. If
that was all we wanted then
p e r h a p s we s h o u l d stop
t a l k i n g a b o u t p o l i t i c s a l -
together. However, the Soc
Soc mailing list had sixty-five
names on it at the beginning
of this year; now it stands at
ninety-eight.

Dear Mark
W i t h r e f e r e n c e to I a n
Hodgson's letter ( F E L I X 606)
I should like to make the
following points:
The S C C "booze u p " was
financed with £20 of S C C
funds specifically earmarked
for e n t e r t a i n m e n t , and by
contributions from Stephen
Goulder and M r s Pingree, the
College Archivist. The effec-
t i v e c a p i t a cost of those
attending was about £1. The
evening was highly successful,
e n a b l i n g S C C m e m b e r s ,
usually lound heckling each
other, to relax and mingle.
This can only be good for
S C C and IC Union"
Contrast that with Welfare
D a y . N o t m o r e t h a n 30
people attended any single
event during the afternoon.
The programme was arranged
with a lot of time, effort and
money. The per capita cost
for those who did turn up was
around £4 or £5. The benefit?
Good for a very small number
of people.
If you readers agree with
M r Hodgson then we must
e x p e c t a n o u t c r y at the
"waste of money" on Welfare
Day rather than expressions
of disquiet at the very low
attendance. W h a t are our
priorities?

Dear Mark
I feel duty bound to reply
to the letter in the last issue of
F E L I X written by M a r t i n
T a y l o r . I ' m sorry t h a t I
cannot answer his question
myself, since being bound up
in the o r g a n i s a t i o n I was
unable to attend much of the
discussion. I can only suggest
that he asks someone who was
there (though I shouldn't
spend too much time looking)
or phones Gay Switchboard
on 8 3 7 - 7 3 2 4 — t h e y ' l l be
happy to discuss it.

Dear Mark
I am most surprised at the
recent controversy over the
use of the IC Radio Logo on
posters, advertising the Links
Carnival, on two counts.
Firstly, M r Nunns states in
his letter ( F E L I X 606) that
permission was not obtained
from the station to use the
l o g o . I f i n d this h a r d to
understand, as I know M r
Neil Sykes, IC Radio M a n a -
ger, to be a most charitable
and friendly person, and I feel
sure that if approached in the
Southside Bar, where he is to
be found most evenings, and
offered a pint of cider, he
would have given the required
permission.
Secondly, I cannot see any
reason why the Links Carnival
should be p u b l i c i s e d w i t h
posters s h o w i n g a h a r d l y
visible crocodile in the top
right-hand corner. I have it
on good authority that the
reason for the crocodile on IC
Radio's logo is that Crocodile
Rock by Elton J o h n was the
first record p l a y e d on the
medium wave service of the
station. It will surely be some
years yet before the music of
Elton J o h n is considered so
unfamiliar and unacceptable
to the average IC student to
merit its live exposure at an
e v e n t s u c h as the L i n k s
Carnival.

to exceed 300 words) must be
