Reggie, the mascot of Kings College London, was successfully
stolen by the Royal College of Science Union in the early
hours of yesterday morning.
T h e mascot is a large red concrete lion which is extremely heavy and
was previously stolen by R C S t J in 1976. T h e raid took place after three
days of careful reconnaisance earlier i n the week, during which it was
established that Reggie was resting on some steps i n one of the m a i n
College buildings.
A group of about fifteen people leTt the R C S U Office at 6:00am
Thursday, including City a n d Guilds U n i o n President M r A n d r e w
Rushton, who had been told to come to the office at that time as part of
the treasure hunt for Spanner and Bolt. They arrived at K i n g s College
and managed to haul the lion to a waiting v a n with only a little
resistance from cleaning staff. A letter was left for the K i n g s College
President explaining the move a n d stating that Reggie would be
returned after money h a d been collected from R C S R a g .
Reggie was displayed at the R C S Hustings U G M which took place
yesterday (see report).
