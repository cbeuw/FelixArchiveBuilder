" Y o u are charged that on the afternoon of
Saturday last you and your team contrived to
play the worst thirty-five minutes of hockey
seen for many years and yet still had the
impudence to lead 1-0 at half-time. D o you
have anything to say for y o u r s e l f "
" W e l l y o u r h o n o u r , we were t o t a l l y
overawed by the occasion. T o play against
I C at H a r l i n g t o n is every pilots d r e a m
and "
" S i l e n c e ! W e w i l l m o v e o n t o t h e
circumstances of your goal. Is it not true that
you had so many attempts to put the ball in
that the I C Captain was moved to throw a
wobbly at his defense."
" I ' m afraid so your honour. I apologise for
any undue suffering we may have caused."
" T h a t ' s all very well young man, but did
you not proceed to p l a y e q u a l l y b a d l y
throughout the rest of the first half, further
demoralising the I C team who were totally
incapable of scoring."
" W e did let them score three times in the
second half your Lordship, the first being a
magnificent goal by Stroomer, with Rhodes
setting up the other two for Mitchell and
W y l i e . "
" G r o v e l l i n g will get you nowhere y o u
pathetic little creature, I've a good m i n d to
sentence you to two seasons hard labour on
the O l d Creightonians potato patch."
" N o ! Please! I ' d rather play against the
team of Pete Sharpe's."
" W e l l , o n this occasion I a m prepared to
be lenient; you are to leave this court and
spend the rest of the season i n the very
darkest depths at the bottom of the League."

Celebrating his return to form, club hotshot
Steve Harrison notched up another 97 to
c o m p l e t e a n o u t s t a n d i n g year w i t h a n
average of about 85.
I n c r e a s i n g a t t e n d a n c e b y female c l u b

hierarchy of the committee, notably Denis
Sleath (club captain, contact via M e c h E n g

prosper under new leadership next year.

Football
Fifths
In some recent studies I have shown that the
preparation of a win takes place i n three
steps:
Opponent + ball S J ^ I C V + ball —(1)
I C V + ball = goal —(2)
Opponent + ball = goal —(3)
In my latest study, the opponents being
R o y a l Holloway College III, the equilibrium
in (1), for the first forty-five minutes was far
to the right-hand side due to hard work and
good running. Consequently, step (2) was
dominant and was catalysed effectively by a
complex known as Dave Stephenson, the
half-time score being 6-0. In the latter stages
of the reaction, the equilibrium i n (1) was
moved to the left-hand side by Phil Niccolls
and the catalyst for reaction (2) was poisoned
due to the thought of two jugs (3 goals + 1 j u g
of beer). However, step (3) was inhibited by a
strong and resourceful defence and only one
goal was scored, a n d this was due to the
keeper's open legs. The reaction was finally
terminated by the referee's whistle.
Further studies are under way and will be
published soon.

Swimming &
Water Polo
Despite a variety of difficulties the team, bar
Nick Last, arrived i n Bristol i n time for the
match. The benefits of training had obviously
been spoilt by some activity the previous
night (Links Carnival?) for we didn't get a
single first i n a n y race. W e n d y M o o r e
managed two second places in contrast to the
rest w h o were consistent, if not fast, a n d
frequently occupied the minor places in the
races.

In the water polo match against Bristol we
had our reputation shot to pieces in a 17-3
thrashing. The swimming match may have
tired some o f o u r p l a y e r s , b u t we were
c o m p l e t e l y outclassed. C o n s o l a t i o n goals
came from M a x Casini (2), and Jim Boucher.
The rest ol us weren't really concentrating on
the game; Paul had a go at all-in wrestling,
Chris used his best Anglo-Saxon words in
conversation with the ref, and R i c h casually
swam from end to end occasionally admiring
the way M a r t i n picked the ball out of the
net.
Team: R. Leach, C. Carton, J. Boucher, B.

Q Sailing
After a notable absence, the team were back
at the H a r p o n Saturday.
City were the first opposition, and after a
somewhat dubious gate start, gave Imperial
2, 3, 4 at the windward mark. O n the first
offwind leg, M i l l s managed to catch the
leading boat and forced him to let Kennedy
and Bennet through at the wing mark, albeit
with one or two minor collisions. The race
finished with Imperial i n a commanding
position and City conceded the race.
After a confusing incident i n the second
race, it was decided to restart it to avoid bad
feelings a n d a fracas with the opposition.
Unfortunately Imperial lost this race and the
next, thus losing the match 1-2.
A f t e r a b r e a k f o r l u n c h ( e t c . ) t h e
introduction of a U L ladies crew revitalised
the team for their performance against Sussex
(or was it just G r a h a m wanting to show off
his neoprene?). B y the e n d of the first
windward leg, Imperial had a commanding
1, 2, 6 and finished i n these positions. The
second race started with Sussex on the gate.
After a disappointing first beat, Imperial
were 2, 3, 6 at the w i n d w a r d mark. However,
during the offwind legs, M i l l s and Kennedy
closed the gap between them and the leading
boat and with excellent team racing during
the final beat managed to push the Sussex
boat to third place. Imperial thus won 1, 2, 6
and to everyone's surprise R e d m a n managed
to keep out of trouble at the back of the fleet
in both races.
T e a m : Bennet, Butler, Kennedy, Mills,
Redman, Tounghusband.
§ Rugby
Seconds
The day started at the unearthly hour of
9:45, when despite the Carnival, most people
arrived on time, though some were obviously
still feeling the effects of drink. This and the
fact that we were only given ten minutes to
change led to a very slow start by I C . Soon
the pack, with C . D e R o h a n making his
debut a n d o u r c o l l a p s i b l e c a p t a i n , B e l l ,
began to take control. It wasn't long before
R a l p h scored from a five yard (1.5 metre)
scrum. This was how it remained until half-
time w h e n the oranges seemed to w a k e
everybody up. There then followed a number
of fluent moves, w i t h N o d d y a p p e a r i n g
everywhere. This resulted i n four tries of
which two were especially good as everybody
h a d a h a n d i n t h e m . T h e tries by N i c
Brummel, Alastair Davies, Jose Paxaio and
M a r c H u d s o n were all in the corners and so
left M a r c with little chance of converting
them. Thus the final score was 20-0.
T h e n it was down the pub and back i n
time to watch England try to play rugby.
