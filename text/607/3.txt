T H E T R A D I T I O N A L Pancake
Race around Beit Q u a d was held
last Tuesday. U p until 1980 the
race w a s a n a n n u a l contest
b e t w e e n I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
Women's Association ( I C W A )
a n d I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n .
However the event did not take
place last year a n d since then
I C W A has disbanded, the C C U s
and R a g competed this year.
T h e race was revived as part ol
City and Guilds tasks to regain
their violated mascots Spanner
and Bolt. T w o races were held.
In the first C & G beat R C S and
in the second they beat R a g and
the current holders of Spanner
and Bolt, I C U .
City and Guilds also had to sell
pancakes and raised more than
£10 for R a g , selling over 100
pancakes. They hope to make
this a n annual event, although
they don't plan to wear R C S
slopshirts in the future.
As usual the event coincided
with the annual testing ol the fire
hoses in the U n i o n Building and
according to the F E L I X Editor
M r M a r k Smith, who ref'ereed
the event, the Q u a d resembled
"Bangladesh after the ravages of
the monsoon'.
