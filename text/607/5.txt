IRAQ
Students staged a picket outside the Iraqi
Embassy recently to protest against the fascist
.Ba'ath dictatorship in Iraq. A r o u n d one
hundred people participated together with
members of the Iraqi Students Society in U K
(membership of which carries life imprison-
ment under Ba'ath laws.) The picket is part of
a month of solidarity with the people of Iraq on
the anniversary of the first Ba'ath coup in
February 1963.
The coup unleashed a bloody reign of terror
unknown in Iraq. In a few weeks, over 10,000
were killed. Leaders and activists of mass
democratic organisations and trade unions
were hunted down, tortured and executed.
Many were students, members of the General
Union of Students in Iraqi Republic (GUSIR).
Internationally known leaders of G U S I R such
as Abdul Al-Balati, Sahib A l - M e r z a and A d n a n
Al-Barrak were tortured to death. Schools,
colleges and sports grounds, became centres
of interrogation and death. Instrumental in
terror was the Ba'athist nazi-style 'National
Guard'. The infamous National U n i o n of Iraqi
S t u d e n t s ( N U I S ) , as part of the security
services, victimised, tortured and killed many
students in order to destroy G U S I R .
O n l y growing popular p r e s s u r e , a r m e d
Kurdish resistance, international isolation and
bankruptcy of the Junta ended its bloody rule
nine months later.
Today's Ba'athist regime came to power in a
coup in 1968. The political apprenticeship of its
leaders was served in the 'National G u a r d ' in
1963. It is a capital offence to leave the Ba'ath
party, belong to another political party, or
conceal previous affiliation (Article 200, 1969
Penal Code).
Mass executions, poisoning by Thallium,
racist 'Arabinisation' policies, deportation of
Kurds and Shi'a moslems (over 60,000 people
deported since 1980) are all policies enacted by
the p r e s e n t B a ' a t h i s t r e g i m e u n d e r its
President, Saddam Hussein. The bloody war
against Iran initiated as a chauvinist war of
aggression has killed over 50,000 and injured
many more.
S a d d a m ' s regime has no qualms about
torturing and killing even children. Ali Hama
Salih, twelve years old was recently tortured to
death (Amnesty International report M a r c h 5,
1981). Many hundreds of people in Iraq have
disappeared without trace and although little is
known about their whereabouts, Amnesty
International reports provide little doubt that
extensive and widespread torture is being
carried out in Iraq. .
The Ba'ath dictatorship distinguishes itself
from other fascist regimes through its export
of terror; through assassinations, kidnapping
attacks, and intimidation in which the Iraqi
Embassy and the N U I S are instrumental.
The latest attack took place on Saturday,
February 6, in Birmingham on a member of the
Iraqi Students Society U K following a solidarity
meeting, at which agents from the Embassy,
including one from the military attache, were
identified and excluded. Two days later in
Denby, a high velocity air gun was fired at the
window of an Iraqi ISS member's flat. These
two incidents mark an increase in surveillance
a n d harassment by m e m b e r s of the Iraqi
Security Staff, and the nature of them is highly
disturbing. One of the fears is that the death
lists drawn up by the embassy naming ISS
members (exposed by the British press in
1979) will now be acted upon.
M P s s p o n s o r i n g C A R D R I ( C o m m i t t e e

in Iraq) have put down an Early Day Motion in
the House of Commons calling for an inquiry
into the activities of the Iraqi Embassy. The
motion was signed by M P s from the Labour,
Liberal and Conservative parties and Plaid

Facts about NUIS
1. F o r m e d 1961 by a s m a l l g r o u p of
Ba'athists, N U I S was linked closely to student
organisation, C O S E C , later exposed as a C I A
front.
2. N U I S statutes and policy have never
referred to the academic rights of students.
3. Membership of any other mass organisa-
tion is punishable by life imprisonment.
4. N U I S is instrumental in the barring of all
non-Ba'athist students from education.
5. N U I S has been de-recognised by most
British student unions.
Democractic opinion in the U K from all
quarters, including students unions, trade
unions, M P s and individuals have spoken out
against N U I S and the Embassy's activities. It is
clear that great pressure must be put on the
B r i t i s h g o v e r n m e n t to e n d the c r i m i n a l
activites of the Iraqi Embassy, particularly
since it has recently negotiated a Elbillion
contract for an arms deal with Iraq. Such trade
only serves to maintain repression and prop up
a blood-thirsty regime. The development of
trade should not be used as an excuse for
ignoring the violation of human and democratic
rights in Iraq and the export of Ba'athist
thuggery in Britain. ' ^i

Slugs or Politicians?
by Jeff Fowler
Not many would contest that the reason why
I C U is held in such general contempt is the
absence of drive, initiative and concern for
students that the Exec exhibit. It occurs to me
that this could be linked to the reasons they
stand for office—the 'up through the ranks of
hacks and sideways to the throne' syndrome
described by Andrew Lyall .1 have a depressing
image of hacks scrabbling for campaign issues
rather than expounding the changes they see
as necessitating their candidature.
Some groups at IC may recoil from the
notion of politicizing the Union, but it must be
obvious that only those candidates with a co-
ordinated range of objectives, and a genuine
personal commitment to them, will inject any
real life into I C U . I'm not suggesting that we
should rush off to express solidarity with the
Falkland Islanders, but political issues demand
a political response, and on some aspects of
government our lack of even a policy is
damning. The present government's attitude
to construction expenditure should make Civ
E n g r e a c h for the bicycle clips, but I C U
doesn't even bother with the usual token
appeasement on that one.
It should be obvious that even Bill Cortazzi's
mob are concerned with some aspects of
society in general, which affect us directly, but
which apparently do not appear of marginal
interest to the current Exec. I hope that this
year there will be candidates campaigning on
political issues, and that you will tell the other
usual crowd of hacks and jokers to get lost,
before they tell you to get lost on important
matters which affect us all. Politics may not
appear to offer as much superficial fun as sex
and beer, but over the past years, how much
fun have y o u derived from w a t c h i n g (or
understandably not bothering to watch) the
antics of U G M s of the slugs we usually elect?
Leave Ents and eating faeces to the C C U s
where they seem much more able to manage
such affairs.
To Serve Us
All Our Days
by Robyn Morgan
In F E L I X 605, Andrew Lyall, in his article "1982
Presidential Election", put forward a view
which is shared by a significant proportion of
IC students; "....The normal procedure for
electing a Union President relies on candidates
who have been " b r o u g h t up t h r o u g h the
ranks" in the Union way of thinking and after
the votes have been counted, they take a
single step sideways and sit d o w n in the
Presidential Chair " (my emphasis). This
idea is most emphatically wrong. The only
qualification for a person to stand for any
sabbatical post is that s/he can find one
proposer and ten seconders and the only way
that they may then become a sabbatical officer
is to be the most 'popular' (for want of a better
word) candidate. It can, and no doubt will, be
argued that having had a Union post of some
sort makes a candidate more suitable as a
prospective sabbatical but it is the students
who vote who decide on this and other issues
relevant to the elections. Sabbaticals (or, for
that matter, any other union officers) are not
elected by union 'activists' nor are they elected
by the students who do not vote—an obvious
point perhaps but one that should be made
when only one third of the potential voters
actually exercise their vote in sabbatical
elections.
To sum up: use your vote to choose the
sabbaticals that you want.
