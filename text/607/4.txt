Mines lose Bottle
Camborne Report
O n the m o r n i n g of last Friday at about 10:00am, 140 M i n e r s (players
and spectators) set off to the wilds of the west country to make war
against C a m b o r n e School of Mines.
This event began in 1902 when the first rugby match was played and
indeed (after the varsity match) this is the oldest inter-collegiate fixture
in the country.
O n F r i d a y , four teams and the accompanying supporters mounted
the coaches. T h e games to be played: squash on Friday evening,
hockey Saturday lunchtime, football lunchtime and, most important of
all, the 'Bottle M a t c h ' on Saturday afternoon.
In the squash R S M were squarely beaten by a team of lecturers
whose Unioncards had long been filed in the archives. The hockey was
lost 2-1 and the football, after m u c h ado, was d r a w n 2-2.
Last, but not least, the Bottle M a t c h . T h e R S M forwards did a
magnificent job against what was expected to be a far superior 'pack'.
H o w e v e r on the day, the C a m b o r n e ' W a r r i o r s ' of the 1-8 proved to be
only a fair match. T h e C a m b o r n e 'backs' kicked and grunted and
though not as talented as those of R S M the fly-half usefully exploited
the predicaments in his penalty kicking. T h e end result was a loss to
R S M . Score 15-13. R S M scored two tries and were beaten by penalties
in a most annoying fashion.
In the end the day was won by a most vociferous bunch of supporters
to w h o m every player is grateful. T h e y showed the westerners what it
was all about.

Mining 2
A Tribute to the ' C a m b o r n e M e n '
For 80 years, since 1902
The fine young men of Mines
Have had only one view
Through the courses of time
They have run themselves out
With one objective, the enemy to rout,
"The bottle must be won,"
Has been their rallying cry
Deadly serious — not in fun
And again this year they will have a try.
They fought each other long and hard
They battled trying every trick and card
They scored a try and converted
The other side momentarily diverted
From their course of victory,
But not for long do they have the lead
Mines came back and did their deed.
They took away the ball
And on and on they ran
Oh, please, Oh please, don't fall
The crowd went wild
Oh they cheered to the very last man
One broken foot, one twisted ankle
(But one mustn't iet that rankle)
We'll still beat these boys from Camborne
Even if it means we'll have to fight another dawn
That bottle belongs in the Union Bar
In that London away so far
We must win and have it back
Or the 120 will have us on the rack
The R S M has lost this year
They'll drown their sorrow in a beer
But in the future, come 1983
Camborne will have to pay the fee
And we'll have our bottle back —thankee.
