REDS Certificate AA Starring Warren
Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson.
The cinema epic has all but died since the days
of Doctor Zhiuago and Lawrence of Arabia,
but Warren Beatty's REDS (which opened
yesterday) marks a return to that era.
The story of John Reed, an American writer
who witnessed the Soviet Revolution and
recorded his experience in his book Ten Days
That Shook The World, has obsessed Beatty
for many years. His screen adaptation of
Reed's life and love for radical feminist Louise
Bryant (Diane K e a t o n ) is set against the
backdrop of the upheavals in Russia and
America, which provides a fascinating subject
in a long and stylish film.
Reed meets Bryant in Portland Oregan in
1915 when he is a journalist w o r k i n g o n
matters of social injustice. H e soon becomes
involved in both politics and with Bryant,
who he takes to N e w Y o r k to join his
intellectual friends in Greenwich Village. They
soon marry despite Louise's involvement with
playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson).
J o h n Reed's political activities eventually
throw them apart but they are reunited when
he takes his wife to Russia and they witness
the Soviet Revolution at first hand.
Beatty has chosen an unusual approach to
his t o p i c ; the s t o r y is i n t r o d u c e d a n d
interrupted by interviews with "the witnesses",
friends and acquaintances of Reed and Bryant
who recount gossip and stories from that era.
These old faces remain irritatingly unintrd-
duced, and include Rebecca West, author
Henry Miller, Lady D o r a Russell and many
more beside. They add a personal reality to the
story and tend to serve as links between a
series of f r a c t u r e d e v e n t s . W h i l s t this
technique works quite well, I can't help feeling
that the faces really s h o u l d have b e e n
identified.
Beatty is c o n v i n c i n g as R e e d and his
obsessive love for Louise Bryant was matched
by a romance off screen with Diane Keaton
during filming. The screenplay centres on the
relationship between Reed and Bryant and
thus b o t h lead c h a r a c t e r s . I found D i a n e
Keaton a great disappointment, frozen into her
single screen persona and almost incapable of
expressing a convincing range of emotion.
Apart from this the casting is very strong; Jack
Nicholson turns in another great tight-lipped
performance as Eugene O ' N e i l l , M a u r e e n
S t a p l e t o n s h i n e s as the c y n i c a l E m m a
G o l d m a n and author J e r z y K o s i n k i (who
wrote Being There) is suitably grim as the
fanatical Bolshevik leader Zinoviev. These
characters play out their roles amidst the
confusion and excitement of the time. John
T A P S
R e e d e v e n t u a l l y f o u n d s the A m e r i c a n
Communist Labour Party and goes to Moscow
for recognition, where he is prevented from
returning to America. Separated from his wife,
he attempts to escape and is eventually
reunited before his premature death at the age
of 32.
Reed was indeed an interesting man and
Warren Beatty has used his life to produce an
entertaining and informative film.

Cert A. Starring George C. Scott and
Timothy Hutton. Directed by Harold
Becker.
When a military academy steeped in 140 years
of tradition is informed by the powers that be
that it must close so that the land can be
developed for real estate, it is time to fight
back. When the General commanding the
school is removed from the scene by heart
failure, leaving the senior cadet in charge of the
academy, the resulting situation is, if you'll
pardon the expression, explosive.
Timothy Hutton plays Brian Moreland, the
cadet left in charge when General Harolan
B a c h e ( G e o r g e C . Scott) is r u s h e d into
intensive care. M o r e l a n d , anticipating the
immediate closure of the academy, organises
the seizure of the armoury. Thus armed, the
cadets seal the perimeter and prevent access
to the g r o u n d s u s i n g a r m e d f o r c e . T h e
authorities are unwilling to listen to their
demands for reconsideration of the closure,
and a siege results.
The success of the film rests largely in the
way that tension is built up and sustained
during the course of the seige. The point of
view is constantly and cleverly flipped so that
our sympathies alternately lie with Moreland,
for sticking to his principles and his ideal of
"honour above all", or with Colonel Kirby, the
National G u a r d colonel sent in to defuse the
situation, who is terrified that he might have to
o r d e r his m e n to o p e n fire on w h a t is
essentially a bunch of schoolkids.
T h e c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n s are very s t r o n g ,
although there is just a touch of stereotyping
with the characters shown, the overzealous
militaristic type, and Alex, Moreland's roomate
a n d s o m e t i m e c o n s c i e n c e . T h e s e t w o
c h a r a c t e r s are presented as the p r i n c i p a l
opposing influences on Moreland's thinking,
and in places, this is in danger of becoming a
touch cliched. In the end though, the acting
carries the day, and the character clashes
w i t h i n the r a n k s of the c a d e t s a r e as
interesting as the clashes with the troops
outside.
The result is a film rich in tension, ideas and
excitement. Will the N a t i o n a l G u a r d be
ordered in? If so, will the cadets open fire on
them? O r is there some other way out? See it
and find out.
