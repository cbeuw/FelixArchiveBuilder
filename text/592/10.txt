W h a t ' s O n
Only ten pages this week folks, but don't
worry! I've managed to recruit a few new staff
members and have thus spent a lot of time
e x p l a i n i n g the v a r i o u s stages of F E L I X
p r o d u c t i o n . A s s o o n as they are m o r e
confident things will speed up and a regular
twelve or sixteen page issue will (hopefully) be
possible.
A mere ten pages means that I've had to be a
little severe and chop a few articles and small
ads. It couldn't be helped and I'll try to include
them next week.
C o p y D e a d l i n e
I'll have to go on and on about this until I'm
blue in the face, but here goes
Any article for inclusion in Friday's F E L I X
must reach the office not later than 1:30pm
Monday. N o w that we've all settled in, I will
have no qualms about destroying anything
received after this time.
Refectory flats
It disappoints me that J o h n S m i t h , the
College Secretary has not replied to the
points raised by M r Marshall in F E L I X 591.
The main question is, why are these flats left
empty for long periods of time while accom-
modation in L o n d o n is so scarce?
U G M Inadequacy
Even though the motion on Iranian students
was passed at the last U G M , I was dismayed
to discover that the proposer of the motion
was not in fact a student of this College.
Admittedly, the situation is fairly difficult in
this case, but surely this should have been
e x p l a i n e d to t h e m e e t i n g a n d t h e i r
p e r m i s s i o n a s k e d to hear an e x t e r n a l
proposer. Instead the decision was made by
the U G M C h a i r m a n , Stephen Goulder, who
will h o p e f u l l y k e e p the m e e t i n g fully
informed in the future. Pass the sick-bag,
Alice!
David Owen
Whilst being pleased that D o c t o r O w e n
should come to our College and lecture on
the S D P , I was rather disappointed that he
gave s u c h a dull a n d b o r i n g s p e e c h . I
popped in at the back of the Great Hall and
after ten minutes found the prospect of a
h a r d a f t e r n o o n ' s slog o n F E L I X m o r e
appealing. Whatever happened to inspiring
oratory and exciting commentary?
The Credits
My grateful thanks to the following people;
Martin, Steve, Shams (to whom I grovellingly
apologise), Debbie, Jane, Paul, Peter, Eddie,
S t e p h e n , M o e z , R i c h a r d , M i c h a e l , Lesley
(you're wonderful), Dave and friend, Phil,
Steve Groves, M a z and Ian.
When General Reisenschein arrested seven
dissidents on a charge of suspected S D P
tendencies, he instructed his jailer to put A in
the first cell, B in the second, and so on round
to G , starting next to the entrance a n d
working anti-clockwise. Alas, the jailer thought
he said clockwise, and when he found out his
mistake the prisoners had already been
allocated cells as shown in the diagram.
Fortunately, all is not lost, for although to
allow two prisoners to see each other before
interrogation would be a serious breach of
security, and to allow any of them through the
main gate would be unthinkable, it is quite
permissible to leave a prisoner locked in the
keyhole-shaped area in the centre. .
But u n l o c k i n g a n d r e l o c k i n g d o o r s is
tedious, jailer wants to go to bed; so can you
help him by showing how he can get A into the
cell where G now is, and the others following
on in alphabetical order anticlockwise round
the ring, using the smallest number of moves.
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me at
the FELIX Office by next Wednesday 1:00pm
please. There is a £5 prize (donated by Mend-
a-Bike) for the correct entry randomly
selected at that time.
The solution to the puzzle in the Freshers'
F E L I X is
Richard Beit Civ Eng
Simon Southside D o C
Tim Garden Biochem
Quentin Weeks Aeronautics
The winner is Chris Bannock, Physics 2.
The solution to the handbook puzzle: first E,
followed by D, B, A and C in that order. B told
the others that only E had beaten him. This
prize was won by Jonathan Holmes, Physics 1.
The cheques can be collected from the F E L I X
Office from Monday afternoon.
And as for last week's quickies, there are
many single-syllable words with eight letters:
S T R E N G T H , T H O U G H T S , S T R A P P E D etc.
S T R E T C H E D has nine, and there doesn't
seem to be a reason why there shouldn't be a
ten-letter one. ( S C R A U N C H E D ? )
There are three six "letter words with no
vowels. R H Y T H M is fairly obvious, and if
R H Y T H M S is a word, then there's a seven
letter one. D R Y F L Y is a technique in fishing,
and there's the lovely a s t r o n o m i c a l term
S Y Z Y G Y .
The only word 1 know with five consecutive
vowels is Q U E U E 1 N G , and the word which
starts with seven consecutive consonants and
ends with nine is S T R Y C H N I N E . (Oh, you
thought I meant !).
