Un-saintly Southampton
Southside Bar had to be closed at 8:45pm on Saturday/ night
when the activities of 33 football players from Southampton
University got completely out of hand. , *
I a
The three teams left soon alter
the bar closed and only then did
the harstalf discover the damage
they had caused. O n e of the
bench seats had caved in and
wallpaper had been ripped Irom
the wall.
At 7:00pm, when the foot-
ballers first arrived in the bar
their behaviour was described as
quiet, but later they started to
play drinking games and became
rowdy. The Southampton players
were j u m p i n g o n the seats,
pissing up walls and ripping all
their clothes off when the bar
was eventually closed by the two'
staff on duty.
The footballers gained access
to t h e b a r w h e n a resident
inadvertantly opened a door in
F a l m o u t h H a l l . The security
guard, who was arguing with
them al the time, was unable to
slop them.
Phil Nieolls, the Captain of Imperial College's football team, has
since tried to telephone the Captain of the Southampton teams to
complain about the incident, but has so far been unable to talk to him.
Nick Morton. I CI Union President, has suggested that Southampton
will be sent I he bill for damages.
