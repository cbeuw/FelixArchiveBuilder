Oblomov
Oblomov (U) (Nikita Mikhalkov, 1979,
USSR) 140 mins, subtitles. Now showing
at the Paris Pullman. Certificate U.
Oblomov. The problem of work, or rather its
ethic, personified into a gentle Oblomov and
his classical foil Stoltz. This conflict, which
gives the film an u n d e r l y i n g t e n s i o n , is
swaddled in a simple plot that offers barely no
restriction to the development of the central
characters. Oblomov will not get up, his best
friend, Stoltz, will not lie down. The story
unwinds.
Oblomov is a gentleman, Stoltz his family's
protege. The disparity of the two is further
enhanced by differing nationalities (Qblmov
Russian, Stoltz German) which together with
their physique and outlook is juxtaposed to
their friendship.
This really is a film of images rather than a
continuous thread, a personalised view of
humanity that is abstracted to the point of
being out of time, a reflection of the timeless
c o n f l i c t s O b l o m o v e n c o u n t e r s i n h i s
relationship with others.
When Oblomov is eventually stirred it is not
due to the e x o r t a t i o n s of S t o l t z or his
worsening financial circumstances, but it is
rather the personal experience of love that
moves him into the 'social' w o r l d . H e is
thwarted and loses the object of his desire to
Stoltz but it is indicative of the isolation of
Oblomov that Clara, the prize of a ritualised
and barely a c k n o w l e d g e d competition, is
hardly more than a caricature, is ephemeral
and the loss of the object is almost incidental
to the sense of failure portrayed by Obiomov.
H i s c h i l d h o o d , unfolded by a series of
flashbacks, is enchantingly photographed and
religiously sentimentafwith a brightly lit figure
moving through a pastel and ever receding
background. These scenes provide justifica-
tion for the philosophy Oblomov expounds
d u r i n g tffe film. S t o l t z , the friendly but
pawnlike businessman, is eventually shown as
passing through the tragedy of others with a
terrifying moral impunity. Even his " t r a p -
p i n g s " , s u c h as his c h i l d - l i k e wife, are
portrayed as hardly impinging on his narrow-
minded, finally caged, self.
The film ends with a scene almost identical
to the opening shots—a child running across
an undefined plane calling "Mother". This
reference to mother, together with the 'closed
cycle' of similar opening and closing, are tied in
with Oblomov's reasoning to make the whole
enterprise a moral exposition embodied by
characters but eventually greater than the
individual.
A simple, beautifully crafted and very
Russian film.
History of the
World (Parti)
Certificate AA. Starring Mel Brooks,
Madelaine Kahn, Pamela Stephenson.
Directed by Mel Brooks. Now showing all
over London.
Hey folks! Give ear! You've read the school
textbooks, now see the film: only don't expect
the same thing! But has Mel Brooks really re-
written history, or has he merely pointed out
some of the detail that historians have,
throughout ages, considered a little...well...
naughty? O r is there any truth in the rumour
that history itself is subjected to D-notices
from someone in a rather highish position, ff
this is so then fear n O more, people of the
world! Y o u shall forever be illuminated, for this
is the H I S T O R Y O F T H E W O R L D (Part One,
to be precise); and its star/producer/writer/
director, M r Mel Brooks, in his own modest
way calls it an 'epic'.
History of the World Part One is the sort of
stuff that would make C . B . De Mille and D.W.
Griffith turn, nay, rotate in their graves. The
film starts at the dawn of mankind and goes on
to the stone age, the Roman Empire, the
Spanish Inquisition and the French Revolution,
all being narrated throughout by Orson Wells
(whose laryngitis has got considerably better,
so it seems). The film is in the typical zany
Mel Brooks style, though, for my taste, the
slapstick often becomes a little too monoton-
ous. Even though the cinema audience wasn't
exactly rolling over the aisle with laughter, the
film definitely has its moments of originality,
and is worth seeing, if only for these. It isn't the
best comedy of the year, and definitly not the
best Mel Brooks comedy, but it's worth a try
anyway. Also starring in the film is Pamela
Stephenson, who is as charming and sexy as
ever.
So, if you want to see what the stone age
men really got up to, if you want to meet
Empress Nympho "the sultry, sensuous, sinful
seductress of all Rome", if you want to go to
Louis the XVIth's court and find out what a
Garcon-de-pisse is, then (in his own words
again) Mel Brooks is going to tell you "....the
whole truth, whether it's true or not". Amen.

Going down
Really well
The five-piece rock band 'Really' caused quite
a stir at the G u i l d s ' F r e s h e r s ' Party last
Thursday. The usual half-hour spot reserved
for entertainers was lengthened by the two
encores demanded by the impressed IC
crowd.
All members of the band agreed that they
had enjoyed playing in the J C R and were
pleased with the sound that they had made.
Lead vocalist, Marian, and bass and lead
guitarists Dave and Mark claim to be strongly
influenced by Elvis Costello whom they have
supported in concert. Bass player Dave seems
more reminiscent of a bald Ian Dury.
Really played in the Union Concert Hall as
support band to Wild Willy Barrett and John
Otway last term and I'm sure that the IC E N T S
C o m m i t t e e (not represented at the party
incidentally) will be keen to give Really another
booking.
Meanwhile for those of you who would like
another chance to see the Leeds-based band,
their next gig is at the Moonlight Club, West
Hampstead on October 29.
