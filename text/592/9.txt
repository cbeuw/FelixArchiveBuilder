Firsts
Alter an impressive start the first eleven were
r a t h e r u n f o r t u n a t e lo f i n d t h e m s e l v e s
eventual losers.
For the first hall IC were the dominant
team stringing their passes together effectively
to test t h e S o u t h a m p t o n d e f e n c e o n
numerous occasions. T h e prolonged period of
pressure resulted in a pair of goals for Elliott.
T h e lirst from a good shot following a solo
run heating several men and the second a
neat piece ol finishing from an intelligent
through ball from Rickard.
Throughout this period Williams in the IC
goal had had a quiet time but he began to see
more action towards the end of the hall as
Southampton started to find their way into
the game. Southampton's game continued lo
improve in the second half, as the IC team
began to live in what was after all their lirst
game ol the new season.
A good through ball gave the Southampton
forwards the drop on the IC defence for the
first time and an exemplary piece of finishing
made the score 2-1. After this IC left the
dclence exposed on several occasions, and
finally a half cleared ball found a free man on
the edge of the penalty area whose mis-hit
shot Hew into the lop corner lo equalise.
However Southampton's winning goal was a
p e r s o n a l d i s a s t e r for K e v R e e v e w h o
continued to find the- corner of the IC goal
rather than the dismayed Williams.

Seconds
A n inspirational Captain's display by R.
Wiggins led to the Seconds first victory ol the
season. Arrested without underpants on the
Cromwell Road the previous night he scored
a 'Hash' goal after only twenty seconds ol this
game. Alter twenty minutes his shot from
twenty yards sent twenty supporters (!!) wild
o n the t o u c h l i n e s . D a v e D e a n c l i n i c a l l y
finished off the first half scoring with a
tremendous drive from twenty yards. T h e
second hall began with Saunders scoring
from an acute angle with a well-planned set-
piece. Southampton s superior fitness told as
they scored three quick goals but some good
delence including some line saves from the
t e m p e r a m e n t a l genius keeper, S. V e a t s
allowed I C to hang on.
A special mention should be given to the
two new faces in the team: Andy Page and
M i c k Powell, who both made impressive
starts.
After the match, history was made when
M . Armstrong ruined his reputation as a
'dirty' player by having a shower.

Rowing
What was it? Was it the rain al four o'clock
or the boats not tinning up at Freshers' Fair
till nearly three.' W h a t ever ii was the
'beginners' response to the Boat C l u b was
pretty disappointing. IC Boat C l u b is alive
a n d k i c k i n g a n d l o o k i n g f o r w a r d to a
successful year. But we need more people,
especially beginners, women of any standard,
and coxes. ( X B : Last year 35% of the Boal
C l u b was women.)
W e row from our well-equipped boathouse
just the other side of Putney Bridge, on
Wednesdays and Saturdays lor everyone and
S u n d a y s lor the more e x p e r i e n c e d m e n .
Training has already started since we have
two or three events this term. There are four
or live events next term and a regatta every
other week in the summer, culminating in a

July. Anyone interested should either write to
me in M e e h E n g letter-racks or see us clown
at the b o a t h o u s e o n W e d n e s d a y s or

The lirst race of the season was held last
Saturday at M a n o r Park F a r m . Guildford. It
was also the lirst race in the Reebok League.
\\ e journeyed to Guildford fairly uneventfully
apart from mislaying one of the team before
we bad reached Waterloo! However, we
rejoined our colleague before (be beginning
ol the race.
The course was, as usual, a little on the
quaggy side, with a gentle drizzle accompani-
ment, bul this did nothing but increase the
pleasure of the- pasty and tea provided after
the finish. Out ol the dozen men's teams
entered we were pipped at the post to come
twelfth, despite a commendable achievement
of 21st position by T . Asleriades.
O u r lady member, Sara Pearson, also
deserves credit lor coming twelfth.
I would like to thank I he oilier members of
the n a m : P. Holdsworth, R. Weston, R.
Morrison. M . Benson and A . Britton for their
support.

'flic day started badly with 1G arriving an
hour laic due to infrequent trains—hence the
" I r a n i s t r i p " between W i m b l e d o n a n d
Motspur Park when we all changed into kit!
Two teams were submitted ihis year; both
played extremely well. However, our B team
were drawn in a tough section and won one out
of lour games—Julie scored the two goals
there—in the last game she suffered a knee
injury and was taken off.
M y hopes lor the A t e a m w e r e not
disappointed—we won our section and then
went on lo heat Guys I in the quarter-finals,
R H G I in the semis and W Y E I in the finals!
Now the U L Shield is ours, we're set lor a
Successful season.
My thanks to all who played especially
Alison C r u m h i e , who scored all our goals.

Firsts
Alter a tentative beginning in their match at
Enfield, IG went ahead midway through the
fust half thanks to a debut goal by Bensal.
The firsts continued to cause the opposition
problems, particularly when exploiting the
gaps It-It in their defence as (hey threw men
forward (o try and save the game. Unfor-
tunately, they were able to scramble a goal
with the last touch of the match.
Seconds
C o m i n g into this match with a virtually
untried learn. IG found il difficult to settle
down and play as a unit. The delence. with
Chris Bird and Andy Whitehead looking very
solid had lo cope with strong Amersham
pressure over the first hall an hour. It was
then thai Pete Hughes ran into one ol the
outbreaks ol violence1
that seem to have
dogged his short career. H a v i n g heard his
colleague being threatened with 'a clocking'
by a member of the- opposition. A n d y G a r m s
was inspired to go on one ol his deceptively
aimless dribbles and finally ran into a loot.
From the resulting short corner the ball
c a m e lo Hughes who paused at the top ol his
backswing as il undecided as to whether he
should change to a 9-iron, and finally crashed
the ball into the net.
fins left IC wilh a rather undeserved 1-0
lead at hall-lime. In the second hall however.
Amersham look advantage of their superior
mate li-lilness lo score twice after consistent
pressure-. Despite- the defeat. IG can le>ok with
confidence lo their 100% record in terms ol
goals score-el from sliols cm goal.

Thirds
IG started well. Tim Mitchell soon put in a
lucky goal and proceeded to prove (hat it was
a lluke by hitting the post on more than three
occasions. O u r elderly opposition had two
n e t b o u n d shots d i s a l l o w e d a n d f u r t h e r
attacks were hampered by the brick-wall
effect of Peter C u n n i n g h a m . A goal levelled
the scores to end the match, but not before
one last effort by the Captain, which was
blocked by our own full-back who was in the
p r o c e s s of o b s t r u c t i n g the o p p o s i t i o n
goalkeeper.
