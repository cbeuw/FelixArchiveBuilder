EXEC VIEWS
Nick
I was pleased to see a well attended, interesting U G M last week. But
where were the rest of you? Anyway, whether or not you were at that
meeting you can help us all out with a minimum of effort.
The meeting passed a motion to write letters to M P s to defend
ourselves against the cuts. The External Affairs Officer and I have drawn
up a standard letter and it has now been duplicated. Copies are available
in the Union Office along with a list of M P s . All we are asking you to do is
sign a copy, put your home address on it and we will mail it to your M P .
Simple. If you have the time to make it more personal you can write it out
in your own handwriting. There is little point in doing this unless we
have a lot of letters. Please pop over and help this campaign.
Finally (for this week anyway) on the cuts, would those people who
wanted to go on the Salford demonstration please come and see me in the
office today.

First of all I'd like to say that I'm very sorry to have caused Judo Club
and Fencing C l u b so much trouble during the Freshers' Fair and to
assure them that I shall advise my successor not to make this same
mistake. N o w I'd like to apologise to 'Wargames' for the disgraceful way
in which they were driven out of the S C R by R C S U beer drinkers.
However, I must emphasize to anyone using the Union Building or its
facilities that if there is a problem then the sooner they tell me the sooner
it will get rectified (actually I'm quite good at sorting out these sorts
of problems).
If you've a complaint please come up to the Union Office and fill in an
"official apology from the D P " form and get me to sign it.
P S : If your club or society needs storage space, e.g. a cupboard or a
room then drop me a line and I'll see what I can do.
