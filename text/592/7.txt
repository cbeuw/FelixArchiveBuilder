would suit you
The demands of marketing management are high, but so are the rewards-in job
satisfaction and material terms. You can find out about the challenge of marketing
management by spending five days on Procter & Gamble's
Marketing Vacation Course.
We arc one of the most successful manufacturers of fast movi
consumer goods in the world and acknowledged leaders in
the marketing management field. The UK Company
markets such household names as Ariel. Fairy Liquid.
Head & Shoulders, Crest, Flash, Daz and Camay.
Between 14th and 18th December, we will b
running an informal, but intensive,
marketing management course for a group
of final year undergraduates at our Head
Office. Full accommodation and all expenses
will be paid. During the Course you will
actively participate in business projects
ranging from product development and
consumer research to television advertising
and in-storc promotion. They will give you a
real feel of the challenge, intellectual
siimulation and enjoyment of marketing
management, and insight into the broad
range of activities involved. You will also
have a chance to meet some of the wide
variation of people with whom a marketing
manager works.
If you are interested in learning about
Marketing Management, you should apply
as soon as possible.

full complement of aircraft. The second day
was the only non-flying day, owing to a howling
gale which grounded everything, so we spent
the day navigating the C a m in a punt.
The remaining days were all flyable, though
the tasks set tended to be rather ambitious, i.e.
almost everyone landed out in fields every day.
O n the fourth day five gliders landed within a
few minutes of each other in a small field some
distance from the airfield. The field wasn't a
particularly good one for landing in, but after
one glider had landed there the rest just
followed. O n the final day eight gliders came
down at RAF Henlow, including all three IC
gliders.
It was generally agreed that the competition
was good fun and well worth entering. The two
glass gliders came second and fourth out of a
field of five, but our star performance was the
Bocian which worked its way up the field to
come third out of twelve.
The Gliding Club not only takes part in
competitions, but also trains pilots. If you think
you might like to learn to fly why not come
along to one of our meetings every Thursday
at 5:30pm in Aero 254; new members are
always welcome.
SF Soc
Wittgenstein once said "if you can't talk about
it, point to it." This is all very well, but it does
make S F Soc bulletins very difficult to write, or
think about for that matter.
Which leads us straight on to the news. We
have oodles of members. This is good. We
need as many as possible, so if you haven't
j o i n e d , do (meetings lunchtime S o u t h s i d e
Upper Lounge Fridays) either at a meeting or a
film showing. To be quite blunt, we need
members because E N T S are trying to stop
anyone but themselves showing films by
imposing severe financial restraints without
any warning (this way no one could apply for a
Union grant increase to compensate in time).
Things are not as black as they may seem from
the foregoing though, so be of good cheer. I
have no doubt that next terms choice of films
will be just as good (come to a meeting if you
wish to influence that choice, or indeed borrow
a book from our library (no lending time limit
unless someone really wants to read what
you've borrowed)).
City & Guilds
O K here goes. Most important event this week
r
is the Election U G M for Vice-President and
Publicity Officer. Hustings and Elections for
the posts will be at the meeting, so be there to
cast your vote.
