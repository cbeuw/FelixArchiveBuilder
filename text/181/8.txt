The crew coxes, envious of their contemporaries on the banks
and in the river, decided to throw, not just bags of flour or sods
of earth, but Eights at one another. This just about sums up the
sport as we experienced it on the river.
The Lowry race was rowed over a course of one mile on the
ebbing tide, a tide low enough for there to be little or no advantage
of one station over another. The stations were: the far bank,
C. & G . ; centre, R.C.S.; and on Surrey, R . S . M . The crews got
away to a good start, however, the appearance of two schoolboy
crews in the path of the race made it necessary for both Guilds'
and Mines' crews to converge on R.C.S. The resulting fray cut some
R.C.S. men and broke a Guilds' blade. The launch returned to the
boathouse and collected a spare oar and in due course the crews were
lined up again for a perfect start. R.C.S. and Guilds went off
at 35 to Mines' 32. The extra life in the Guilds boat quickly pro-
duced a lead of one length which they maintained to Beverley
Brook where suddenly they
" clicked" and rowing beauti-
fully they took an extra length
and a quarter. Guilds and R.C.S.
both finished at 36 with Mines
coming in 3 lengths behind
R.C.S. at 28.
The Morphy race, from Ham-
mersmith to Putney Bridge, a
course of I f miles, was rowed
with practically no help from the
tide which was due to turn. The
stations were: the far bank,

R . S . M . ; centre, C . & G . ; and on
Surrey, R . C . S This race was
marred by bad coxing on the part
of R.C.S. and C . & G . Both
coxes were repeatedly warned
(particularly the cox of the C . &
G . boat) about their steering.
The course of the Mines' crew
was unimpeachable. After a
good start by all crews, the
R.C.S. boat was immediately
steered into the Guilds' boat
which was about a canvas up at
the time. This incident caused
Guilds to become a little un-
nerved and their lead was lost.
Both crews then proceeded to
zig-zag for the next mile or so,
according to best submarine
avoidance practice, repeatedly
steering in front of the Mines'
crew which was then about 1|
lengths down. U p to this point
no advantage was taken by
R.C.S. or Guilds. Then hap-
pened an incident which may
well have been more serious than
it was. Near Beverley Brook the
C. & G . cox, forced the R.C.S.
boat into a direct line with the
moored barges. The resulting
necessary manoeuvre by the
R.C.S. cox caused not only a
clash with the Guilds' crew, but
also with the side of the barge.
Immediately the C . & G . crew
took a lead of a J length
and maintained it to the
finish. A t the finish an appeal
by R.C.S. was countered by an
appeal by C . & G . against the
foul by R.C.S. at the start. The
Umpire, M r . C. A . Bristow, took
the best possible action by de-
claring the race void, ordering a
re-row with all three crews start-
ing on level terms. The re-row
was over about | mile with the
tide gently flooding. The start
by Guilds was brilliant. A t a
rating of 45 they quickly took a
lead of half a length over R.C.S.
and one length over Mines' and
maintained it to the finish. Even
in the re-row however the Guilds'
cox had to be continually warned.
A l l congratulations to the
Guilds' oarsmen who, despite the
coxes' efforts, proved their
superiority. The races were
close, however, and if the R.C.S.
crews had had coaches to drive
them just that bit.harder during
training, the results may well have
been reversed. Congratulations
to Mines too on producing their
fastest Morphy crew for many
years.
The talent displayed in these
Morphy races bodes well for the
future of I.C. rowing. Remem-
ber, however, that the I.C. 1st
Eight does not compete only with
other college crews, but mainly
with crews whose standard is
World Class, rather like the
Rugby 1st Fifteen meeting every
week teams like the Springboks.
For success, therefore, a very high
standard is demanded.

After six weeks of term, I C is
still without a Boxing Club Com-
mittee. Although the three con-
stituent Colleges have been re-
quested to elect Boxing Captains,
little effort has as yet been made
to form a Rector's Cup Com-
mittee.
Admittedly few people attend
the training sessions, supervised
by a qualified coach, but surely
there is sufficient interest in the
sport to ensure that the Rector's
Cup, which is one of the high-
lights of the inter-collegiate sports
calendar is not jeopardised by the
apathy which at present appears
all too prevalent ?
