Overseas Vacation Service
by J . E . Hamilton
In the preceding issue of " F e l i x " we described the facilities
offered by I.A.E.S.T.E. for the placing of Students overseas during
summer vacations for the purpose of gaining technical experience
in industry.
Thanks to a number of students coming forward with their
personal accounts of various countries visited, we are now able to
cover stories given by two of them, with others to follow in later
editions.
Keith Robson and Tony Stock of the Chemical Engineering
Department left Newcastle in June, 1961, on a 1,500 mile journey
to take jobs obtained for them by I.A.E.S.T.E. with Typpi Oy.,
at Oulu, a town on the Baltic coast of Finland.
The journey to Finland was not undertaken together. M r .
Stock travelled alone to Denmark, then by rail and sea to Oulu via
Stockholm whilst M r . Robson went by sea to Oslo, then by rail
to Oulu.
Typpi Oy. (Typpi & Co.) oper-
ates an ammonia synthesis plant;
manufactures nitrogen products
and artificial fertilizers. Here
the two students worked as pro-
cess operatives.
In an interview last week both
men emphasised that as far as
technical experience goes, and
having been alloted jobs of some
responsibility, they were given
and took opportunity to learn
much about the processes in-
volved. Ketih Robson held one
position during the two months of
work, though Tony Stock was
given a greater variety of jobs, all
which he found quite satisfying.
From their first day at the
works both were aware of the re-
freshing lack of resentment to-
wards students by Finnish work-
men, a far cry from the atmos-

phere that many of us have put
up with in British industrial
works. Indeed, they said, every-
one, from operative to manager,
went out of their way to be
helpful in a factory where there
was little if any evidence of a class
structure such as exists in plants
of the same type in many
countries.
They learned that in some sea-
port towns (of which Oulu was
one), Swedish is commonly spoken
with Finnish relegated to second
place. In the student hostel
where they lived some English
was spoken thus the language
barrier was found not to be too
great an obstacle. Outside the
hostel, however, the problem of
making oneself understood is
greater and the tourist may re-
ceive a poor impression of the
country as a result. Both our
students learned a little Finnish,
almost to the point of convincing
one young lady that they were
Finns—but not quite . . . or so
they say . . .
When asked what in their
opinion was the most stri. /\g
physical difference between
British and Finnish towns, the
reply was instantaneous—" The
forests." A vast forest encroach-
ing upon the very outskirts of a
town is beyond comprehension
until seen personally, and the
very sight of it at once makes
plain the fact that the town to
Finland is in some way what an
oasis is to the desert. Perhaps the
united stand against Nature in her
toughest mood has moulded the
Finnish character into what it is
to-day — with hospitality and
equality well to the fore,
During their two months' work,
the local secretary of I.A.E.S.T.E.
arranged visits for the students
living at the hostel to local fac-
tories ; he organised a week's
tour of Lapland as well as
numerous social functions, all of
which our two students availed
themselves, also of the traditonal
Sauna, or steam bath—usually
taken on a Friday evening to be
followed by a meal at a friend's
home. The Sauna was in this
case owned by the Company.
After two months' paid work
Keith Robson was able to afford
a holiday of one month in Fin-
l a n d , some of this time being
spent by both students as guests
of the families of friends they
made at Oulu, who seemed to
think it a matter of course that
Messrs. Robson and Stock would
visit them at their homes, the only
question to solve being that of
when the visit would take place.
Tony Stock eventually made
the homeward trip via Denmark
again, where he hitch-hiked his
way to Esbjerg and from there
went by sea to Harwich.
Keith Robson returned to
England by way of Copenhagen,
making the Helsinki-Copenhagen
step of the journey by air under
a cheap travel scheme organised
by S.S.T.S.—the Scandinavian
Students' Travel Service.
From the account given by
these two men, it was abundantly
clear that they liked the work, the
Finns and their land.
Who will be next, we wonder,
to follow them and to see Finland
for themselves ?
R.C.S. Court
A Special Meeting of the R.C.S. Union was held i n order to
judge the sins of the two trophy officers, Dean and Churchill. The
two were accused of being responsible for the disappearance of the
college mascot and rumours were spread that it had been sold to
Guilds for a considerable sum. The court was held on the steps
of the Imperial Institute as no one else seemed willing to entertain
the Union.
The two officers, suitably attired, were first charged with mis-
appropriating service equipment, gross negligence, sleeping on duty,
being drunk and disorderly, and gross immorality. O n being accused,
Churchill pleaded N o t Guilty, and Dean, Guilty but Insanitary. A
constant bombardment of tomatoes, rice and buckets of water showed
the court's disapproval.
The President warned the 250
odd jury that they should listen
carefully to the evidence before
finding the officers guilty. The
President then called upon Cap-
tain S. Adlum to put forward the
case for the prosecution. With
great verve Capt. Adlum pro-
duced several empty bottles as
evidence, and called upon im-
partial witnesses to prove that, on
the night, Dean had been drunk,
and Churchill had been in bed
with someone called F l u . H e
then summed up the evidence and
asked for the severest penalties,
and with a final wave of his fez,
called upon the court ot institute
the death penalty.
General Edwards was then
called upon to conduct the case
for the defence. H e immediately
began by appealing to the reason
and mercy of the court in this
matter, the answering roar show-
ing that he had better appeal for
help. H e then presented several
witnesses who appeared to have
been bribed by the prosecution,
and ended with an elegant appeal
for the accused.
A s nobody could hear a word
of this, it did not appear to make
much difference. After General
Edwards had finished, the Presi-
dent inquired whether he had
been speaking for or against the
accused, as he appeared to have
convinced everyone of their guilt.
It seemed that he had in fact been
speaking for the defence, and
had done a very successful job
for the prosecution. After the
President's very impartial sum-
ming up, the Jury was asked for
its verdict.
" Guilty ! " was the cry. The
President then ordered the execu-
tion.
After bombardment with toma-
toes, they were washed clean in
the Round Pond, several asso-
ciated members then being forced
to join them. The President, see-
ing that he himself was threat-
ened, decided that it was a nice
time for a swim, and clamly strip-
ping off during the Kangella,
forestalled everyone by diving in.
The traffic round South K e n .
was then given a preview of
Morphy Day by a now greatly
swelled crowd, who marched in
single file across High Street Ken.
with great glee.
