The Brighton Run
Boanerges once again took part in the " Old Crocks R a c e "
held on Sunday, November 4th, being given a rousing send-off by
a substantial crowd of Guildsmen. A short time later, a coach
load of followers set off down the same route, smugly passing several
veterans whose journeys were somewhat shortened this year, only
to come upon Bo standing at a bus stop in Streatham, with a seized
up final drive bearing, possibly due to overloading. Since there
were only four people on board, it was decided that a prominent
member of Guilds was responsible, and it was further proposed
that next year's President should either be considerably lighter or
in the absence of light candidates, a woman should be elected.
We left the crew to it and continued on to Brighton, arriving
at our hotel for lunch some four hours after leaving London. The
dinner was attended by just over one hundred people, the principal
guest being none other than C o l . Browne who designed B o some
sixty years ago. His presence, coupled with the arrival of B o and her
grease stained but triumphant
crew, just after the speeches,
made this one of the most
memorable dinners to date.
Bo's tenders had a striking tale
of perserverance and engineering
(?) to tell. After removing the
bearing from Bo, they had rushed
it back to College, separated the
parts, re-ground and re-reamed
them, and returned at full speed
to Bo. They then replaced the
parts, and still managed to reach
Brighton by 2.10 p.m., in plenty
of time to qualify for the medal
and pennant. Total running rime
was only three hours, which is

The most important forthcom-
ing event is the Guilds-Mines
Carnival on the 23rd November.
Tickets are now on sale, and we
would like to stress that fancy
dress is preferable to trousers and
other contemporary accoutre-
ments.

The Union Office is now open,
and a member of the Executive
can be found there every lunch-
B o at speed
time between the hours of 1 and
2 p.m. Internal phone number
is 2093 and the office is on level 2
in the E 1 Building. A l l Guilds
Union and Societies mail is now
routed to this office, and it is
possible to have queries answered
and guidance given. (Please note
that this is N O T a marriage
bureau.)

The Royal College of Science,
having discovered the loss of their
mascot, decided to court martial
those gentlemen responsible for
Theta's well-being. These being
found guilty, were then cleansed
of their sins in the Round Pond.
Original ideas on what to do with
future negligent "Theta Bearers"
may be obtained, on application
with s.a.e., from any member of
the Guilds Executive.

Morphy Day was more of a
success for Guilds than ever. (See
full report.—Ed.) The battle of
the Sacks was found to be not
enough to occupy all 250 Guilds-
men present, Chris Liddle's pro-
mise of half a pint of Arthur's
bitter for every pair of R C S type
trousers costing him some fifty
shillings.
