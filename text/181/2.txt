The Editor wishes to apologise
to contributors for omitting
some recently submitted artic-
les. Short staffing problems at
the printers has resulted in an
eight page issue instead of the
intended ten pages.

While few of us wish to know the future, many hope-
reasonably—to have a hand In shaping It; and this
requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But
traditional methods of probing the future are no longer
In favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.
Witches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today
one turns, in the first instance, to the appointments
officer for the pathways to the future. We, for
our part, would like to elaborate what lies along
one of them—Unilever Research.

Research In Unilever means Industrial research:
research directed to specific ends: research with a
practical outcome. But not only that. No industrial
project or problem stands in isolation. Its roots rarely
He In industry. So, research in Unilever also means
research in a number of contrasting fields—detergents,
edible fats, foods, cosmetics—and It means, further,
research in surface chemistry, glyceride chemistry,
protein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental
topics. It means a community of scientific Interest within
Unilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.
It can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction
to the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.
It can provide satisfaction In the pursuit of it and
financial reward in the success of it. There is only one
minor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.

Dear Sir,
In the last issue of "Felix"
there appeared an article suggest-
ing that l.C. would do well to join
N.U.S. The authors of that
article, Messrs. Bob Finch and
Les Massey, may be said to be
"slightly left of centre" in their
political outlook; in fact, the
whole question of joining N.U.S.
is thought of by some as being
just another " Socialist stunt."
I have no political connections
and I am not worried about the
politics of N.U.S. Indeed I
gather that N.U.S. has been very
restrained in expressing any
political opinions in recent years.
What I do know is that N.U.S.
campaigns for adequate grants
~nnd good facilities for students, it
runs a Student Travel Agency
and organises Drama Festivals,
Debating Tournaments and many
other schemes. It is probably
true that the I.C. Vacation Train-
ing Scheme is better than that
provided by the N.U.S., but on
the other hand N.U.S. provides
many services and schemes which
a single college union just cannot
give. Not the least of these ser-
vices are the student concessions
which are available on all sorts of
goods from typewriters to tape
recorders and from cameras to
canoes.
What would be the cost to
I.C.I The I.C. Union would
have to pay nearly £200 per year
for subscriptions plus some con-
ference expenses. Then there
would be quite a lot of secretarial
work to be done and a post Of
N.U.S. Secretary would have to
be established in I.C. Union.
Is it worth the trouble ?
Nearly all the other university
students in this country have the
benefit of the services of N.U.S.
and I think that I.C. students
should also be able {without pay-
ing 15/- for a separate subscrip-
tion) to make the most of these
services. If we members of Im-
perial College want to join
N.U.S., then it is up to us to
decide.

Dear Sir,
I have recently been able to
look .through and compare the
newspapers of a wide variety of
Colleges and Universities. In
most cases, it appeared that a
large and informed staff produced
the many items of news necessary
for its survival. Many of them
were newspapers in the truest
sense of the word.
Comparing these with your
paper, the most immediate differ-
ence appears to be the lack of
actual news which Felix shows.
This would seem to be due in part
to a shortage of staff, and in part
to a lack of relevant information.
I submit that were every society
and club to send to the Editor a
complementary ticket to every
function in the college oalendar,
the " Felix " (and, incidentally,
the clubs concerned), would bene-
fit substantially. This would en-
able the Editor either to attend
the function himself, or to send a
member of his staff, thus creating
a closer tie between College and
newspaper, and a better and less
journalistic " Felix."
Yours,
J. M. COMBES.
Sir,
The last edition of "Felix"
contains a statement by Mr. H. T.
Lovenbury which purports to be
a " reply " to an article appearing
under our three names in your
edition of Ylth October. We
would like to make some brief
comments on this statement.
Apart from being factually in-
accurate and misleading, Mr.
Lovenbury's article is almost
totally irrelevant to the issues
raised by us. These centred on
the question of the policies pur-
sued by the Exploration Board,
which Mr. Lovenbury's statement
no more than touches upon. Per-
haps it is necessary to state more
explicitly some of the points
which require clarification.
(1) By what criterion does the
Board assess the merits of pro-
posals submitted to it, and allo-
cate funds to expeditions ?
(2) Does the Board accept
complete responsibility for every
expedition which it approves ?
// not, under what circumstances
does it withhold formal ap-
proval ?
(3) The Board annually sets
aside app. £200 to form a Reserve
Fund, which at present stands at
app. £600. Under precisely what
circumstances will this fund be
spent ?
(4) A more restricted question.
In an exposition of the Board's
composition and functions pub-
lished in 1960 it is stated : " The
Board owes its origin to the efforts
of a small group of students who
prepared an ambitious scheme for
a climbing expedition in the
Karakoram during the summer of
1957." Similar schemes were
proposed to the Board in both
1961 and 1962. Are mountain-
eering scientific- expeditions of
this nature a thing of the past ?
// not, when will the Board be in
a position to assist, rather than
frustrate, a similar venture ? If
so, should valuable time be lost
in attempting to organise an ex-
pedition, which at the moment
seems to fall out of line with the
sort of project on which the
Board " envisages " spending its
reserve fund ?
Mr. Lovenbury cannot be ex-
pected to answer these ques-
tions, since, as far as is known,
his personal views do not deter-
mine the policies of the Explora-
tion Board.
Yours, etc.,
F. EKMAN
