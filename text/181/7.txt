SQUASH
A t 10.30 a.m. on Saturday.
27th October, two teams of
squash players, plus appropriate
support, set off from I.C. for a
co-ordinated attack on four Cam-
bridge Colleges. Our match
secretary had a thoroughly or-
ganised programme of matches
planned, even down to the details
of the pubs which should be
visited, and when. H e had ex-
ceeded himself, however, by put-
ing one team against Christ Col-
lege and the other against Corpus
Christi. I knew from the start
that this would be too much for
me, and had taken the precaution
of including in my car a certain
David Anderson, former Cam-
bridge agent, who sought acade-
mic asylum in London last Octo-
bre. Despite this, we managed to
get half the second team to each
of the two colleges, while the two
cars full of the first team played
" follow-my-leader" round the
one-way streets of Cambridge.
Distances are small in these pro-
vincial towns, however, and we
soon sorted ourselves out.
For the Squash after lunch, the
1st V fielded a varied collection
of players. A s first string, IC
can now boast possession of an
Egyptian international player,
Sherif Afifi, who was ably sup-
ported by Robin Creed, whose
honours include playing for his
county, and as first string for his
former university. A t N o . 3, Eric
Burnett from Rhodesia came on
the court, breathing fire and de-
termination to make up for the
lack of fighting spirit he detects
in British players. Fourth string
was Michael Combes, wielding
what was once described as the
perfect gamesmanship technique
of playing three shots to his oppo-
net's one during the knock-up.
Bringing up the rear was the cap-
tain whose chief claim i o
notoriety is an obstinate refusal
to run more than six inches in
search of a ball. (Or so the rest
of the team will tell you.)
A l l the matches were won, and
we embarked on the evening's
festivities well pleased with our-
selves. In the meantime, the
second team had lost to Corpus
Christi but were all set to make
a come-back the following day.
It is believed that all the players
found some obscure corner in
which to rest for at least a few
hours during the night. A t any
rate, all were in good enough
health by Sunday afternoon to
acquit themselves honourably on
the courts. The first team beat
Queen's College 4—1, and the
second team lost by match to St.
John's College.

Although the Club now boasts nearly seventy playing members
who have shown sufficient enthusiasm to warrant the formation of
a fifth eleven, five weeks have passed without success; the difficulties
being no home pitch and a number of'people who will not tick
off before Friday evening.
In spits of these setbacks, which last throughout the season, the
trials revealed considerable talent—always useful for mixed hockey,
so although there were no outstanding players, there should be some
strong sides in the club. With more than half of last year's 1st eleven
still playing, success should come
with practice, if we can learn to versity Cup, but fortunately we
settle down during a game. The survived to fight again, with a re-
7 -
Cup team should benefit from a
player in the University side, and
a player-coach who has Inter-
national honours. But the for-
ward line must learn to shoot
once they reach the circle.
Twelve goals in eight games and
six against one side, is too con-
clusive.
The first eleven have had only
a few creditable performances;
the first match of the season
against Centymca, when we lost
2—0, to a team of Indians who
were better individuals than our-
selves. The next Saturday match
against a strong West Essex side
resulted in a 1—1 draw with
Phillips scoring our only goal.
The latest failure last Wednesday
was in the first round of the Uni-
play in a fortnight's time.
Surprisingly it was the freshers
who wilted under the physical
strain of those games, so train-
ing has been arranged, at their in-
convenience, every Monday and
Thursday lunchtime, meeting in
the gym. Of course all members
of the first and second elevens will
attend.
A t the beginning of term, more
than fifty freshers signed the list
of prospective members, but
nearly twenty of them have yet to
go near a hockey pitch this sea-
son. Should they, or anybody
else wish to play hockey at all
this season, please contact me
through the Union rack, or in
room 34, Old Hostel.

In the away fixture with Kings
last Tuesday, IC just managed to
snatch a draw in the swimming
match by winning both relays.
T o have done this against the
strongest London College after
failing to win the individual events
was a very commendable effort
and the fighting spirit of the team
was very noticeable. The Water
Polo was a bit more one-sided for
after an opening goal by King's,
I C quickly picked up, winning by
six goals to two. Scorers for IC
were Clark (2), Collins (2), C .
Davis and J. Davis.
After four matches this season,
the first team remains undefeated
in both swimming and polo, while
the second team (has only lost
once, to U C 1st team by a narrow
margin. Both these teams will be
entered in the University Handi-
cap Knock-out Water Polo Com-
petition on the 27th of this month
and it is hoped that one of them
will retain the trophy which has
been held by I C twice in the past
three years.
A full team has also been en-
tered in the University Swimming
Championships at U L U , the finals
of which take place this evening
(14th Nov.). I C are the holders
of this trophy at the moment, and
stand a good chance of retaining
it for a further twelve months.
A l l supporters are very wel-
come at either of these events and
at all other matches.

SOCCER
The University League Pro-
gramme is in full swing. The 2nd
X I leads its Division, the 5th X I
is very strongly placed, whilst the
6th and 7th X I ' s are also leaders
of their respective leagues. A l -
though beating I.C. 3rd X I , the
4th's do not seem to have found
their form; and the 1st X I is in
serious trouble. After being
beaten twice by Northampton
College, they have scraped only
one point from three games. The
9th X I has had two successful
games but it is proving exceed-
ingly difficult to find fixtures.
Choosing at random from the
last two weeks, a trip to Cam-
bridge is recalled. The minute
dimensions of Christ's College
pitch at first perplexed I.C. lst's
who started off in a rather shaky
manner. However, the team
soon settled down but the goals
were very slow in coming, and it
was the wing-halves who took the
initiative. A series of cunning
lobs managed to elude the goal-
keeper and four more from the
forwards brought the total to
eight.
Result: W O N 8—1.
SAILING
The club was established in
1948 and grew slowly until to-day
it is one of the strongest in the
University of London. The club
owns six 12ft. " National Firefly "
dinghies and sails at the Welsh
Harp, Neasden, an excellent
stretch of sailing water. The club
is very lucky to be able to sail
here.
The club has in the past had
several figures well known in the
sailing world, John Conway-Jones
and Graham Taylor among them,
both of them scoring high in the
national championships in their
times. A t present the club has
slightly declined because of the
lack of good freshers, but it still
has a high standing in the Uni-
versity of London. It has a good
name for keeping its boats in ex-
cellent order and for the high
standard of its members, four of
whom sail regularly for U . L .
teams.
David Pentz, the commodore,
comes from the Solent area, the
traditional home of sailing, and
has many years' experience, firstly
in Cadets and then in Fireflies,
behind him. He maintains a
good example in his leadership of
the club and has been instru-
mental in the latest expansion to
six boats. Vice-commodore John
Klaschka captains the second
team and looks after the clitb's
racing interests. H e and Hon.
Sec. Basil Alsopp developed the
instruction scheme to its present
strength, when twenty people are
instructed each Wednesday.
Andrew Thomson, Treasurer,
came to L . C . with a good record
in Merlin dinghies, and has been
developing well in his first year,
now being an excellent 2nd team
member. H e has also sailed for
the University 2nd team.
The executive is well sup-
ported by a hard working com-
mittee, amongst whom are Stevie
Vines, organiser of the Easter
East Coast cruise, Eric Twiname,
and Penny Howard, the U . L .
Ladies team captain.
This year the club has had a
good intake of freshers and is
thriving. Many of the new mem-
bers are showing great enthus-
iasm, so that we can look forward
to a good year of sailing.
