Sailing Club venture
onto Welsh waters
In December Imperial Sailing Club
ventured into the land of sheep and
dragons for their first away event of
the year- The Welsh Dragon. With
two days of sailing and a sheep themed
social the event hosted by Cardiff Uni-
versity was set to be a good one.
Day one saw a frankly abysmal per-
formance from the 3 boat Imperial
team in the mini-league. In their first
race, against Portsmouth Firsts, Impe-
rial got 4th 5th and 6th, giving Port-
smouth 1st 2nd and 3rd. Imperial’s
second race, against Exeter Ladies,
wasn’t much better. Imperial had a
fighting chance until the second mark
when Gavin MacAulay got a penalty
turn from trying a risky overtake then
crashing into an Exeter boat. Chris
O’Donnell was forced the wrong side
of the mark, trying to push his way into
a gap that was too small and which he
had no right to be in, leaving Fiona
Wall to battle all three Exeter boats by
herself. This ended up with Imperial
getting another 4th 5th 6th.
The second lot of the days racing was
marginally better, but still unsuccess-
ful, with Imperial getting a 3rd 4th 6th
against Swansea in a race which was
closely fought to the end. The last race
of the day was against the hosts- Car-
diff. The Imperial team fought hard,
but a mark trap from Cardiff at the
last mark put the hosts in 1st 2nd 3rd
– a wining position and so stealing the
race from Imperial. In Imperial’s de-
fence three of the teams they raced got
through to the semi-finals, and Port-
smouth won the league.
Day two brought much more wind
and with it, a fresh chance for Impe-
rial with a King Of The Hill competi-
tion- a royal rumble style competition
where the worst placing teams from
the league start off at the bottom and
fight their way to the top. Lose one race
and you’re out.
In a major (non-Imperial related) in-
cident on the first day, one of the boats
was damaged and put out of use. In the
interest of fairness it was decided that
racing would just be 2 v. 2.
Miraculously, Imperial didn’t start
off at the very bottom of the Hill, that
honour went to UWE and Bristol
Fourths. Bristol walked over their op-
ponents getting 1st and 2nd, knocking
UWE out of the competition. Imperial
then raced Bristol and in turn, Bristol
were crushed, giving Imperial 1st 2nd
and putting them ahead of two teams-
Bristol and UWE. Imperial continued
in this manner, beating anyone who
came their way with a 1st 2nd.
Imperial’s luck started to turn when
they came against Brunel. Chris
O’Donnell got off to a very poor start
-only just crossing the line when the
other boats were reaching the first
mark, and with Gavin MacAulay in
2nd things were looking bleak. On
the downwind leg Gavin sped into first
and put himself in a perfect position to
mark-trap the two Brunel boats. Gavin
cut across the path of the Brunel boats,
shouting wildly, forcing them to keep
out of his path. In the confusion the
two Brunel boats crashed, taking each
other out of the race allowing Chris to
sail past, giving Imperial another 1st
2nd. Remarkably, after this race Chris
realised he’d been racing all day in a
boat with two holes in it, requiring a
change over before the next race...
Imperial’s final race of the day was
against Portsmouth Seconds. In a
closely fought race Portsmouth domi-
nated on the final leg and won with a
1st 2nd, knocking Imperial out of the
competition and going on to win the
whole King Of The Hill. Overall, Im-
perial got to the middle of the Hill.

We still need your opinions. There’s a little bit more
to do, you’ll see when you’re on there, but we need
your thoughts before we have our polished final
version.

pointing result for the foilists, then,
who were hoping for more.
In the epee, Helen Pennington was
knocked out in the 128 and club presi-
dent Emily Bottle in the 32. Another
day, and still no medals! The mood was
decidedly dampened after the day’s
matches and the Saturday night Not-
tingham pub crawl was perfectly timed
to lift everyone’s spirits!
Of course, the people fencing on
Sunday didn’t partake in the alcohol-
fuelled revelry and were all bright-eyed
and alert on Sunday as they took to
the pistes. Six girls were competing
for Imperial in the Women’s foil and
three guys for the Men’s Sabre. After
two fruitless days, the last two events
brought some promising results in the
poules, and before too long, there were
three foilists in the last eight and two
sabreurs in the semis!
Alice Mitchell got knocked out in a
close quarter-final match; Outi Suppo-
nen and the ever-dependable Hannah
Bryars made it to the semis, meaning
Imperial were guaranteed at least four
medals…Unfortunately, kit problems
led to Supponen’s defeat in her semi-
final : the all-Imperial final was not to
be. In the end, though, Bryars came
through with her usual mix of style and
grit to clinch the gold for the fourth
year running.Adding to the medals,
Maiyuran Ratneswaran banished the
demons of last year’s Staircase Incident
with a convincing 1st place, while Hen-
ry Gann confirmed Imperial’s domina-
tion of the day with a bronze medal.
One medal more than last year, and
a great time had by all : bring on next
year!
