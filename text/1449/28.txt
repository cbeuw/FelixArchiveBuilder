at 12.45. Well done lads, and Fergal.
You are a little too keen, but meah shit
happens. Best to have participation
even if you are a little bit weird to be
honest. I mean, seriously, do you actu-
ally wait in the quad for the paper?

Depresso-scopes; I hate my life but I hate yours more
This is probably the last thing that I will ever write, consider it my last will and testament
Cancer
This week you see the
counsellor and she
advises that you write
down your feelings in a
diary. It actually works,
your head feels less
cluttered. But then your housemate finds it, and
reads it out to the rest of the house. You come
back to find them laughing in the living room
and that evening you burn your diary and finally
decide that there’ll never be any salvation for you.
Virgo
This week, before you
enter the shower, you
take a look at your
face and decide to cut
yourself, just a little.
You take a single blade
razor and touch it to your thigh but as your push
the metal down, you falter and put it back. You
get into the shower, there’s no hot water. You
slide down the wall and curl up in the corner
and try to convince yourself not to give up.
Gemini
This week you write
a horoscope (see left)
about how your girl-
friend cheated on you
with your best friend.
But you don’t have a
girlfriend, everytime a girl talks to you, you get
nervous and become really awkward. You also
don’t have a best friend. The few friends you
have don’t like you that much. You just tag along
really. That’s why you write the horoscopes.
Pisces
This week your
girlfriend catches you
helping an old lady
across the road. She
says she’s fed up with
all the attention you
give other woman and dumps you on the spot.
She comes around your house and gives you a
DVD. It’s a video that she made when she fucked
your best friend. You recognize the poster in the
video, they fucked on your bed.
Leo
This week you’ve got a
lab report in. Just like
every other week of
university. Just like eve-
ry other week of your
depressing, monoto-
nous and futile existence. You can actually feel
the mundane weight of the world slowly crushing
your skull into the concrete. Pushing, squeezing,
grinding, the boot of the world on your ear until....
POP, you’re dead.
Aries
This week you go
visit your mother. You
bring her your favour-
ite childhood photo.
It’s of you and your
father playing in the
garden, before everything changed. You show it to
her but she’s too busy on the phone and just waves
you away and mouths “Come back tomorrow”
.
You feel like shouting “Why would I ever come
back to you!” But you don’t. You never do.
Scorpio
This week, as you walk
into university, a walk
of over an hour because
you can’t afford the bus
or tube, it begins to
snow. It gets colder and
colder and unfortunately you left your jacket at
home. You succumb to the elements and die. Your
body is concealed in the snow. Nobody notices
that you’re even gone until you don’t turn up for
exams in June.
Libra
This week, while your
sitting alone in the
library cafe, a nice girl
sits down and offers
you a crisp. You smile
at her suspiciously and
reach in to take one. But your arm accidentally
knocks her coffee all over the floor. You apologize
frantically and run to buy her a new one. But
when you return, she’s already left. The coffee’s
beginning to burn your fingers. It feels good.
Taurus
This week you feel
the ground shaking.
It’s an earthquake!
The ceiling’s about to
fall and you’re fucked
but you live in Haiti
so Death is probably a relief from the shitness
of everyday life. Miraculously you survive but
some douchebag BBC photographer takes a
photo of you as you emerge and now you’re
whored out to every major news outlet.
Capricorn
This week, one of
the horoscopes
exactly matches your
experiences. You begin
to hope that maybe the
writer of the horoscopes
is a kindred spirit, rejected by society. But no, I just
made these up, but you live it, every single day of
your dull and meaningless existence. This is life,
it doesn’t get any better and eventually you die.
That’s all. Sorry. Pint?
Aquarius
This week, you’re
lying in bed and
staring at the ceiling.
Your room is pretty
bare, there’s nothing
to look at which
is why you stare at the ceiling. The mattress
is hard and uncomfortable and there’s only
three hours before the new day begins again.
Another night without sleep and tomorrow,
another day without joy.

Sagittarius
This week, as you write
your cries for attention
in the horoscopes,
the rest of the Editors
laugh and joke about
how edgy they are this
week. They don’t really care whether you live or
die. If you didn’t come down here to do your page
each week, they wouldn’t care. They wouldn’t text
or call you. They’d just advertise for a new Editor.
They’d probably do a better job than you.
