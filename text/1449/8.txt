felix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010
Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, who didn’t attend the meetings personally claims
China achieved what it set out to
Copenhagen + Self interest = Failure :(
Being carefully turned in the candle-
light, crystalline reflections were cast
across the scroll strewn desk. Angular
yet polished, shining yet black as the
unlit night, the previously worthless
anthracite was becoming the focus
of one of the world’s greatest minds.
A pair of well worn hands lightly fol-
lowed the cleaved boundaries as the
rock’s discovery was told by an immac-
ulately turned out senator, his tunic
golden in the dim illumination, aptly
matching the fossilised amber hang-
ing from the Emperor’s neck. Under
the all too common canvas, the politi-
cian could feel the tangible weight of
his superior’s intellect as the details of
extraction and combustion were di-
vulged, almost seeing the birth of in-
dustry dancing in those deep eyes; the
visions of fully mechanised campaigns
that would succeed success in Gaul, life
for the populous of the Empire incom-
parably bettered through plenty and
luxury, the spread of civilisation into
the wild lands.
Had Marcus Aurelius discovered
fossil fuels and thus stimulated an in-
dustrial revolution akin to ours, popu-
lation numbers and moderation not-
withstanding, the Earth would now
be a very different place. A summer’s
afternoon picnic would not blossom
amongst the delicate flowers of an al-
pine meadow, but instead be hosted by
a swathe of coarse hardy grass adjacent
to some hulking shadow of former in-
dustrialised glory. Manufactured fun-
gal protein would replace the sumptu-
ous steak sandwiches, and there would
be no orange, chocolate or coffee to
amuse the palette. Satiated sunbathing
wouldn’t be a temptation, the sky hav-
ing been scorched by some overzealous
geo-engineers a number of centuries
ago; fruitless attempts to miti-
gate rising temperatures.
Finally the children, in-
stead of running bare-
foot through
the woodland
and gleefully
shouting af-
ter the wildlife
that issued from
nearby hollows
and boughs,
would chat-

Ben Fry examines just why things went so wrong, and outlines the possible paths to be taken
the verge of the concreted vehicle bays,
each with their virtual reality glasses
on, taking the ‘Rainforest Experience’.
On returning they ask their equally
perplexed parents if they remembered
what the forest smelt like.
In this parallel history, the short term
decisions the Romans took to revel in
a few hundred years of hard earned,
high carbon opulence led to the even-
tual climatic collapse of various natural
systems, bequeathing a forced synthet-
ic future, characterised by grey squalor,
change conference in Copenhagen was
a relatively inert agreement that was
a last minute product of two weeks
of negotiation; a fortnight dominated
by self-service, short-sightedness and
confusion. Although it was the first
time that developing countries had
found such a strong voice in the global
arena, the resulting ‘Copenhagen Ac-
cord’ lacks any principled substance
(such as global emissions targets and
related timeframes) that could ensure
an ambitious, fair and legally binding
climate deal. It also is only “noted” by
the UN, not actually adopted, so its
function currently remains unclear.
The USA, China, and Saudi Arabia
are specific parties who have attracted
significant criticism in the Copenha-
gen fallout, commonly being recog-
nised for respectively ignoring their
historic responsibilities, blocking the
legal aspects of the negotiations, and
making all possible moves to disrupt
consensus amongst the parties. Rays of
light in comparison to these inhibitory
fossils were the nation of Tuvalu for
strongly voicing the need for a com-
prehensive agreement, Brazil for vol-
unteering significant finance when not
obliged to, and (once again) the UN
Secretary General for some remark-
able diplomacy.
As a process, these are mere tips
of the beautifully proverbial iceberg.
There were many more relationships
built and lost, hidden discussions,
leaked documents and impasses than
can possibly be described in a coherent
text, and this complexity and inherent
dysfunction is causing a number of
parties to lose confidence in this entire
practice, the faith ironically melting
away with the diagnostic icebergs.
So what becomes of the world, par-
ticularly those whose ancestors have
laboured to create the now drying Sub-
Saharan Africa and the now sinking
small ocean states, while all the talk
continues? Given man’s significant ex-
acerbation of the natural cosmic cycles
that have dictated the Earth’s meteor-
ology for billions of years, changes in
our activities can genuinely change the
climatic path of the world. We have
two clear options. We can continue
with business as usual, feeding insa-
tiable consumer lifestyles, shying from
political boldness and so condemn-
ing future humanity to a narrative of
struggle in the spluttering world al-
luded to earlier. Alternatively the exist-
ing suite of world leaders, arguably the
most powerful people who have ever
lived, can use the insubstantial but
not meaningless ‘accord’ as a basis for
building a strong international treaty
during the course of this year, swiftly
incentivising all sectors to pursue ho-
listic sustainability. Only with clear
guidance within an accepted paradigm
will developed society then consider
forgoing their ‘rights’ to unlimited
electricity, second cars, new shoes and
beef Wellington, in so not jeopardising
the longevity of folk capriciously born
into less fortunate communities.
If we are able to transform our lan-
guage from the dominating but nar-
row, short term economics to one that
genuinely values natural and human
assets, there is yet hope. This very pos-
sible alternative unfortunately won’t
ensure the perpetual existence of the
human race, though it would give
foreseeable generations licence to ex-
ist more harmoniously amongst both
natural and philosophically bright
greenery. THE KEY

Tuvalu - with its highest point at only 4.5 metres above sea level, may not be
with us for too much longer, but won’t go down without a fight
to almost a millennia of their earthly
descendents. If this parallel story was
indeed ours, it is curious to think how
history would remember the Romans.
If the international climate accord,
activities and attitudes remain un-
changed, the current cohort of pow-
erful political leaders and subservient
civilian voters may become bitterly
viewed by the coming gen-
era- tions. The
