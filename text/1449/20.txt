MUSIC
Kadhim Shubber and Jamie Fraser quizzed them about the massacre, charitable celebrities and silver fists
Mice bled for Yeasayer’s Odd Blood
Felix: Why did you decide to release
Ambling Alp for free?
Ira Wolf Tuton: We want as many
people to hear the music we’re mak-
ing as possible. We’re pretty aware of
the industry environment that we live
and work in and we’re trying to react
to it as it changes. So we don’t have the
luxury to rely on massive million dol-
lar marketing schemes or young pretty
faces. We’re weathered, handsome,
musicians that need to give a little to
get a little. So we give our singles out
and if you like ‘em then maybe we see
you at shows or maybe you buy the
record - hopefully you wanna help
us keep making records. Your money
ain’t going to my castle yet. We’re just
trying for longevity. I wanna make
more records.
F: Is the video about man(and woman)
kind’s search for the almighty silver
fist? (see right - Ed)
Ira: It’s whatever you want it to be my
man.
F: How did the group harmonies first
come about? would you argue that
they’re a focal point of your sound?
Ira: They definitely were for the first
record. The Strokes and Interpol were
the archetype when we we recorded
All Hour Cymbals. We probably re-
acted against that as much as we found
common ground with our interests in
different choral traditions from around
the world whether it was Sacred Harp
Singers or Missa Luba. I think vocal
and harmonic music was really impor-
tant for all three of us in our musical
upbringing and helped inform all of
our musical vocabulary, whether it was
being turned on by singing along to
something as ubiquitous as the Beatles
or trying to understand some more
obscure singing styles from around
the world. I think we departed from a
focus on choral arrangement on Odd
Blood but the vocals have remained
a core element. We wanted to give a
nod to the production techniques of
some of the more contemporary popu-
lar music that we love and listen to but
until now, hadn’t directly engaged. But
that was this album. I don’t want to be
in a band that casually regurgitates a
‘sound’. We have so many more direc-
tions that we can explore. That’s what
I get off on.
F:Who’sgotthebestvoiceinthegroup?
Ira: Probably whoever’s giving the in-
terview. But I do think that one of our
strengths is that we have three distinct
vocal styles and tones to play with. It
opens up our ability to play with tam-
bour and arrangement that much
more. It’s really the benefit of having
three instruments as opposed to one.
F: How did you get involved in the
‘Dark was the Night’ compilation CDs?
Ira: We met the guys from The Na-
tional when we played back to back
at a festival in Sweden. A few months
later Bryce and Aaron came to us and
asked if we wanted to be involved with
the project. We were surprised to be
asked, but obviously excited to help
with the red hot charity in any way we
could. We had played that song live
since before the first record was re-
leased, so it was a good opportunity to
finally get it down.
Are there any plans to get involved in
the same sort of HIV awareness
work again?
F: Are there any other charities or
movements that are close to your
heart?
Ira: I would love to be involved with
a number of charities. The fact of
the matter is that we need to attain a
little more success before we can re-
ally begin to have the luxury to “give
back”. That being said, I think an art-
ist is in a tricky position when it comes
to bringing awareness to any number
of issues. Good intentions can some-
times be misconstrued and strong
egos and personalities can take away
from the issue at hand. Other times
in the most insidious of instances,
some people in the public eye use a
tie to a random charity as a chance to
wipe their slate clean and clear their
conscious only to move on and back
to their life. Of course there are ex-
ceptions. But at the base level I am a
musician. I am not a politician, and I
am not an activist. I care deeply about
many many issues and I commend
those people that devote their entire
lives to changing things for the bet-
ter for all of us. I can only hope that
I make enough money in my life to be
able to help support those people in
their missions.
F: Did you record your new album
like your debut (both at home and in
the studio over a long period of time)
or was it a much quicker process?
Ira: We spent three months living in a
home studio in Woodstock, NY. That
was where the lion’s share of the work
was done. It was a different experi-
ence from the recording of the first al-
bum primarily because we had no day
jobs. Our entire job was to make this
record. We had a live work space that
was far enough from our loved distrac-
tions in Brooklyn, but close enough to
them that we could easily get back eve-
ry week or two. We work pretty slowly
and have no real set method but that’s
both the enjoyment as well as the chal-
lenge of it. We revised, arranged and
threw things away and started things
over and beat our heads together until
we had some good meat. In May we
got out of the studio and played some
shows while working out some of the
songs with our live band. Then we got
back to a studio in Manhattan to mix
Alright, you can do this, [exhale], OK steady breathing. Whatever you want it
to be, whatever you want it to be... [exhale] nope no idea..
and add some additional recording for
a month.
F: Was there a conscious attempt to
make your music more accessible?
Ira: We had no idea what we we’re do-
ing on our first record. It was total trial
by fire and we’re still learning. That
“sound” was the sound of a chinese
knock-off blue mic that ‘fell off the
back of a truck’ running straight into
the computer with no pre-amp. We
corrected all our shortcomings with
reverb and delay effects and all that
translated somehow into a cohesive
sound. On the new record we fortu-
nately had the luxury to use a lot more
equipment so we made a strong effort
to really be aware of what was the best
tool to use for each situation. From the
outset we knew we wanted to make a
record that explored more dance pro-
duction techniques. When our drums
got big, we didn’t want them to sound
like a drum circle. We wanted them
to sound like a slamming singular in-
telligent robotic fist pounding a hole
through your chest. I love music that
does that; music that makes you dance,
and we didn’t touch on that on the first
record. There’s also something to be
said for what we want to play live. I
want to be able to sweat and watch
people dance for the next year and
a half. But hey - if you like that first
record, it will always be there to listen
to. We don’t have to redo it.
F: I read that you killed a lot of mice
when you were recording the album,
are you going to dedicate “Odd Blood”
to the mice who bravely lost their lives
in the pursuit of musical excellence?
Ira: There’s nothing brave about some-
thing that waits till you’re sleeping to
come and steal your food and spread its
diseases. Mice have no place in a house
and they need their necks snapped by
snap traps. Throw ‘em outside ‘n’ let
the cats eat ‘em.
The new album “Odd Blood” is out on
February 8th on Mute label. You can
also download their single “Ambling
Alp” for free. Just google it. Check
out the video on youtube too, it’s
very, very strange...
Following the success of their thrilling
“Bongos, Beeps and Basslines”, pio-
neering underground electro-jazz duo
zero dB return with a wicked collection
of unreleased material, an essential
listen for any crossover dance music
fan. These bass-heavy nu-jazz remixes
would work magic in any electro club,
shooting Brazilian carnival madness
through your brain and kicking the
plethora of monotonous dance “artists”
straight in the nuts. - Greg Power
This is an indie pop gem, full of an-
themic swoosh and grandeur. It’s taken
from his rumoured and as yet un-
named second album, due for release
this year. Even for Dev Hynes, the lyr-
ics are strange. “Everybody knows you
want a baby?” well okay... There’s also
a cover of Serge Gainsbourg on the
b-side and so while it isn’t as good as
“Everyone I know is listening to crunk”
(but then what is?) it is certainly worth
a listen. - Alexandra Ashford

ALBUM
White Rabbits are a Brooklyn-based
indie-pop band, a damn fine one too.
Produced by Spoon’s Britt Daniel, their
second album “It’s Frightening” clocks
in at just 35 minutes, leaving no room
for filler.
From the pounding rhythm of “Per-
cussion Gun” to the bittersweet final
ballad “Leave It at the Door” the polyr-
hythmic songs flow with ease, display-
ing a maturity all too rare in the indie
world. - Greg Power
Esmee Denters is a star in her na-
tive Netherlands, given a record deal
by the Prince of Pop himself, Justin
Timberlake. Not only is her first al-
bum produced by JT, but he also sings
backing vocals, plays instruments and
beatboxes on most tracks. Esmee has
an impressive voice, but besides JT’s
electro-pop beats and two catchy tunes
nothing here sounds any different from
every Beyonce/Rihanna album.

ALBUM
The songs on this debut were appar-
ently mostly recorded when the artist
(Helen Page) was just 16 and despite
showing talent, the childishness shows.
It fills the space between cute lyrics
about hanging out at home and a slight
melancholy folk ambience but then
again, that’s hardly the most ground-
breaking combination conceived. It’s
like if Laura Marling released the mu-
sic that she wrote at 16. But there’s def-
inite promise here. - Kadhim Shubber
