FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010
Dave Mustaine: “Don’t ever give up on something or someone that you can’t go a full day without thinking about.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,449 Solution 1448
Okay.. so I forgot to put the letters in
the right order last issue, well the word
was ODALISQUE (where the missing
letter was a U). Well done to the win-
ner The Harry Potter Trio who still
managed to get a corrent answer in.
Big hand to Kelvin Wong who got it
right too, We’ve given you two this
week to make up for it.
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle and then send the whole
grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. You will not get credit
for just the word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and there’s
a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate - just solve it like
normal and insert the letter that you believe makes the word.

Hi. Don’t come

i welcome back to the New
Year. Right that’s all the
pleasantries over. Christ-
mas was good wasn’t it?
Well apart from the small sprinkling
of snow that brought the whole fuck-
ing country to a standstill. Now if I was
Kim Jong-Il and wanting to piss Brown
off I would seize the opportunity whilst
Britain was immobilized and bomb us.
We should count ourselves lucky that
Hitler didn’t have the foresight to at-
tack us in deep Winter, because we’d
have been fucked. But then he only
had one ball. Thinking about it, that’s
probably why he was so fucking wound
up all the time- some nobber had taken
one and put it in the Albert Hall. I as-
sume this was some type of pre Dam-
ien Hirstt exhibition, that’s where ole
Maggie Thatcher got her good looks
from, she was a pickled exhibit too.
Now, I don’t claim to be some type
of specialist train engineer, but I am
pretty sure that the Underground runs
underground, hence the name. So why
do you cancel the services because of
the snow? Fuck knows. And as for the
constant announcements telling me to
watch my step on the platform due to
the ‘adverse whether conditions.’ I’m
not a complete moron. Arsehole. What
does that even mean? Watch your step?
You want me to look at my feet as I
walk? I’m a little preoccupied with the
sheet ice for that. Maybe next week eh?
Besides one of the great benefits, no
the only benefit, about snow is watch-
ing people fall arse over tit, landing in
a crumpled heap on the floor. More of-
ten than not these people are girls. In
stilettoes. Are you fucking stupid? It’s
shitting icy out here you dumbfuck.
But don’t worry, a bunch load of lead-
ers went for a conference about global
warming in Copenhagen. Turned out
that America was just spoiling every
ones day, especially the trees. Well, I for
one didn’t see that coming. So shocked
I had to go and roundhouse kick an old
lady just to bring me back to reality. So
Brown used his brain and decided that
the world would be a much better place
if he solved the problems associated
with turning cold water into hot wa-
ter. Obviously hoping to get rid of the
snow too. He rang up Darling and told
him to offer subsidies of up to £400 for
those replacing inefficient boilers. Dar-
ling replied: “Look mate, I’ve got a shit-
ting financial meltdown here, so fuck
your boilers yeah?”
Stuff Imperial students like:
11. Tankards:
We all love a good tankard, and it
appears that us here at Imperial
have taken tankard loving a little
too far. Seriously, there are tankards
for literately everything behind the
Union bar. Even RCC clubs and shit
like Live? have some.
I propose a cull of all tankards that
are not associated with extreme
laddish behaviour. The only way we
can decide if the tankard is eligi-
ble for laddish behaviour connota-
tions, is to have a boat race. Yes, I
want everyone who has a tankard to
come to that bar and down a pint.
All at once. Not only will profits of
the bar fucking sky rocket, it will
cut the wheat from the chaff. The
wheat can stay, the chaff can take a
hike. And be melted down. No se-
riously this is happening, this place
has gone to the dogs.
And what is wrong with a glass?
mmmmmm.....

Wordpath 1,449
INTERMEDIATE EVIL
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination word by taking
steps using one of three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter for another to
produce a 4 letter word.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters to form a 4 letter word.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the letters with ANY consecutive 4 letters from
a 5, 6 or 7 letter word containing the former 4 letters consecutively.
e.g. DRAW -> RAWE (via DRAWER)
No two consecutive steps can be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST path between the
two words. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

DESTINATION:
