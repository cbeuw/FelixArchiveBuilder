n October 1st 1949, Mao Zedong stood before the Gate of Heav-
enly Peace, facing Tiananmen Square, and declared the founding
of the People’s Republic of China.
On the same day this year, China held huge displays of military
might to celebrate the National Day. 10,000 goose-stepping soldiers marched
down Chang’an Avenue, followed by an impressive array of 500 tanks, the lat-
est in intercontinental ballistic missile technology, over 150 military aircraft,
and 100,000 civilian participants.
The parade, which stretched over three kilometres, was perfectly choreo-
graphed during four months of training. Soldiers were told to blink only once
every forty seconds, and took precisely 116 steps per minute. All of the Com-
munist Party’s senior members attended, including Chairman Hu Jintao and
Premier Wen Jiabao.
The lavish ceremony was a reminder to the country, and the world, of Chi-
na’s growing military, political and economic clout. Despite these significant
gains, China’s leaders still complain that the world has not accepted its emer-
gence. Developed countries argue in turn that China has yet to demonstrate
that it will accept the responsibility which naturally comes with greater power.

T
he Central American country of Honduras has had a turbulent
summer.
In the morning of June 28th, following an arrest warrant is-
sued by the Supreme Court, soldiers from the Honduran military
stormed President Manuel Zelaya’s residence in Tegucigalpa, the capital,
overcame ten presidential guards, bundled Mr. Zelaya into his private jet
while he was still in his pajamas, and sent him into exile in Costa Rica.
Members of the Supreme Court and Roberto Micheletti, the Speaker of
Congress, had deemed Zelaya’s recent attempt at constitutional reform un-
constitutional. Zelaya, a supporter of Hugo Chavez’s socialism, was suppos-
edly seeking to run for a third consecutive term as president.
International reaction to the military coup has been almost universally
negative, and no foreign government has yet recognised the interim govern-
ment led by Mr. Micheletti. Since the coup, Zelaya has made several attempts
to return to power, unsuccessfully trying to land his plane at Tegucigalpa’s
airport on July 5th, and crossing the border from Nicaragua into Hondu-
ras on July 26th, before being forced to turn back by Honduran soldiers.
On September 21st, he reappeared in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa,
prompting a curfew throughout the city, and bringing much of the country
to a standstill until earlier this week.

T
he discovery of a second uranium enrichment plant near the city
of Qom in Iran has prompted outrage from international observ-
ers, but ensuing talks may turn out to be fruitful, for once.
The plant, which can be used for making weapons-usable ura-
nium, suggests that Iran, which is also working to produce plutonium, an-
other bomb ingredient, is getting threateningly close to being able to build
nuclear weapons.
In response to the threat, talks have been held in Geneva between Iran and
six countries – the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.
These talks also open the first formal, direct negotiations between Iran and the
US in three decades. Similar attempts at making Iran relinquish its nuclear am-
bitions have failed because of a lack of support from Russia and China.
This time however, Iran has agreed, in principal, to export much of its stock
of uranium for processing, and to reveal its new plant to UN inspectors within
a fortnight. Western officials caution that these agreements could still unravel
during negotiations over details, but the deals offered the hope that the nuclear
crisis could be diffused, at least temporarily.

Sir Keith O’Nions has taken over the
position of Acting Rector at Imperial
following the resignation of Sir Roy
Anderson. O’Nions began his role at
the start of the New Year and sent out
an introductory e-mail on Monday
giving students some positive hopes
for the coming year.
Sir Keith’s role as Acting Rector is
temporary as the replacement is yet
to be announced, and upon entering
office, he thanked Sir Roy Anderson
for ‘’giving so much to Imperial during
his time as Rector’’ and that his work
means he is ‘’taking the helm of a Uni-
versity in a very strong condition’’.
O’Nions was knighted in 1999 and
has held positions including Director-
General of the Research Councils,
Chief Scientific Advisor to the Minis-
try of Defence, and Head of Depart-
ment of Earth Sciences at Oxford Uni-
versity before setting up the Institute
for Security Science and Technology
upon his arrival at Imperial in 2008.
In his e-mail, he stressed that stu-
dents ‘’are a big part of why Imperial
is here’’, and explained that a strong
memory of his own student days at
Nottingham and Alberta, Canada was
the sense that he mattered to the Uni-
versity. He explained his approach to
be to develop the medium term strate-
gy to maintain a world class education
that the students ‘’expect and deserve’’.
He is very proud of Imperial’s status
and its students, stating ‘’Imperial’s
