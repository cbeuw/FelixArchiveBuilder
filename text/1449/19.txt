So while you guys were snowed in this Christmas, Kadhim Shubber chatted to Al Doyle about the new album
Hot Chip’s One Life Stand out in Feb
Kadhim: The new album sounds less
brash than your previous records, it’s a
little more laid back.
Al Doyle: It’s been a little strange
hearing the responses that we’ve been
getting to the album. The very first in-
terview that we did was with Pitchfork
and they kept saying how low-key the
album is which confused us a little.
K: That wasn’t what you guys were
aiming for I guess.
Al: We’re all about making music that
people can dance to but we’ve always
had a different idea about what con-
stitutes a groove. I don’t think we’ve
ever been brash but it’s a good word
because what some people call electro
these days is just brash noise, a sort
of repetive annoying noise, there’s no
other way to describe it. But that’s not
the kind of music that we’ve ever want-
ed to make.
K: You seemed to have dropped the
heavier guitar elements that you had in
“Made in the Dark”. Was there a spe-
cific reason for that?
Al: We were experimenting with that
during recording and the rehearsals
we’re doing now but it didn’t fit, we felt
like we didn’t really need it.
K: The album feels a lot less silly than
some of the stuff you’ve released be-
fore, it sounds like the band’s a lot
more comfortable with themselves.
Al: It’s true, we don’t have any tracks
like “Shake a fist” from the previous al-
bum. I think it’s a synthesis of what’s
come before. There are some songs,
well actually the two that have been re-
leased so far, One Life Stand and Take
It In, that you might call archetypal
Hot Chip songs. Ultimately you’ve got
the pop song structure, verse, bridge,
chorus but we’ve tried as usual to in-
ject some strangeness, to make it more
interesting. I don’t think we’ve changed
our formula too much but our execu-
tion has definitely improved.
K: The whole thing feels more like a
complete record as well.
Al: Our previous albums I think
worked well as collections of songs but
a lot of the feedback that we got was
that people were confused as to why
we moved around so much stylistically.
I don’t think that many artists would
take that on board but we challenged
ourselves to create something more
cohesive.
K: The songs on this album sound like
they come from a deeper place emo-
tionally, I’m really enjoying “Broth-
ers” but compared with say “Wrestler”,
there’s something different going on.
Al: [laughs] I think Wrestler is prob-
ably the most specific song that we’ve
ever written but I’m glad that you like
“Brothers” because it would probably
be a pastiche of a love song if there
wasn’t genuine emotion behind it.
K: Keeping on that idea, where does
the impulse to juxtapose upbeat melo-
dies with more melancholy lyrics come
from? For example, the Wiley cover
that you did made “Wearing My Rolex”
sound heartfelt.
Al: We ended up making it sound
like he’s upset about losing his rolex
[laughs]. But more seriously, it’s a tra-
dition in a lot of genres. You look back
to Motown and Gospel music from
the South and move through Chicago
and Detroit and the house music com-
ing out from there; the same feeling is
there. The music can be upbeat, and
even the lyrics can be uplifting but it
retains a depressing quality. It’s not a
magic trick but the interplay definitely
creates something interesting for the
listener, which is why we like to do it
and which is why it’s quite common
throughout a lot of genres. It gives the
listener something deeper to come
back to, instead of the kind of songs
you get from the Sugababes.
K: There’s one song specifically from
the album that I wanted to talk about. I
was a bit surprised when I listened to “I
Feel Better” because it sounds like the
kind of music that you hear on the RnB
club scene.
Al: We deliberately wanted to make
that kind of song, we thought it would
be funny to jump on the auto-tune
bandwagon but waaayyyy late. But the
lyrics for most of the song are quite
dark which I think contrasts well with
the type of song it is, but when we got
to the chorus we thought we’d go all
out and use the most clichéd dance
lyrics we could imagine. I guess it’s just
another play with the idea of contrast,
between verse and chorus, major and
minor chords in that song.
K: You’re touring with The xx in the
U.S. for a short while this March, are
you a fan of theirs?
Al: Well I don’t know their music very
well, I don’t have their album but I’ve
been listening to some of their songs
quite a bit recently and I really enjoy it.
We wanted to put together a really ex-
citing bill and they’re getting quite big
in the U.S. so it’s worked out quite well.
K: In your wildest dreams, who would
you want to tour with? And you can’t
choose LCD Soundsystem.
Al: I guess you’ve got to think about
who would be most fun to tour with
so you’ve got to go way back for that,
maybe the Happy Mondays? It was
quite cool a few years back because
Neil Young was playing the same fes-
tivals in Australia that we were, which
was kind of like touring with him. It
was nice seeing Neil Young every day.
K: Everyone at the moment is giving
their recommendations for artists to
look out for in 2010, have you got any?
Al: There’s this artist that Felix and
I are producing called “Planning to
Rock”. The girl’s name is Janine Ros-
tron and she’s done some work with
The Knife as well. We always mention
as well, Grovesnor. The guy’s name is
Rob Smoughton, he’s actually drum-
ming for us on our upcoming tour.
Their both pretty great, check them
out.
K: Do you ever find that it’s difficult to
juggle your commitments to Hot Chip
and LCD Soundsystem?
Al: I do actually, I’m having to miss out
on the tour this year. I’m doing some
rehearsals with them so I might be able
to join them later on in the year but it
hasn’t been decided yet so it’s a bit shit.
This collaboration between skinny
indie pop and one of Britain’s most
interesting rappers almost, almost
works. The first minute or so, where
Roots Manuva raps over the dark am-
bience of The Maccabees single “No
Kind Words” is convincing but then
you realise that there’s been almost no
remixing at all and you’re just listening
to The Maccabees. I don’t dislike them
but this ‘remix’ doesn’t add very much.

Shearwater manage to attain a medie-
val atmosphere to their music without
the mindless cacophony and mum-
blings of bands like Sons of Noel and
Adrian. They make unobtrusive use of
the bongo drums and at times begin to
hit the seamlessness that made Fleet
Foxes debut so appealing. The songs
aren’t particularly “hooky” so you’ve
got to put some effort in. This album
is unlikely to reward the disinterested
listener. - Kadhim Shubber

The first solo effort from the Guille-
mots’ front-man was always going to
be unpredictable. The album opens
with a bang, with a track that sounds
like Paolo Nutini having a wrestling
match with the Scissor Sisters but the
rest of the album is stripped back to a
bare minimum, which allows his skills
as a songwriter to shine. Although the
album doesn’t recapture the manic en-
ergy with which it starts, this is a genu-
inely superb record. - Duncan Casey
Up until now Charlotte Gainsbourg
has been famous for two reasons: hav-
ing a crazy-ass dad and slitting her
clit off in a crazy-ass movie. Her third
studio effort “IRM” was written and
produced by the great Beck, which has
significantly improved the quality of
her songs. The result is a collection of
acoustic balladry and quality pop num-
bers, including an insanely catchy duet
with Beck, “Heaven Can Wait”.

Al Doyle is also in LCD Soundsystem don’t you know?

I don’t understand this album cover
either but the album’s out on February
1st. It’s called “One Life Stand”
I don’t understand... O.k. I do, it’s the
music video for One Life Stand which
is on youtube now. They pointed a
camera at a mirror ball hanging in the
middle of the room to get this effect.
Pretty good eh? Well I like it anyway.
The arrangement of this song is fairly
simple: a sort of repetitive distorted
bass firing at you, combined with ethe-
real vocals and an ascendant piano solo
in the middle of the track. It actually
makes for good listening but the lyri-
cal content assumes the pop position
of, find two lines that rhyme and repeat
throughout the track. It’s taken from
his 2009 album “Turning the Mind” and
I can’t imagine the formula stretching
for 12 tracks. - Kadhim Shubber
