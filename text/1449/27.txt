How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

running in direct lines,
North, West, East and

more than two bridges
connecting any two
distinct islands. Every
island must have the same
number of bridges from
them as the value printed
on them and bridges must

The Cool Kids and Fergal were winners, in 45 minutes.
Happy New Year Imperial! 2009 has
been a great year for RAG, and 2010
promises to be even better. We have
some great events lined up. We’re kick-
ing off 2010 at Stamford Bridge (pun
intended!) with a collection after the
Chelsea vs. Sunderland match at 15:00
on Saturday, 16th. Chelsea Stadium is
only a couple of minutes from campus
by bus, and is a must see for anyone
who hasn’t yet.
On Tuesday 26th, there’s going to be
a bicycle auction in Beit Quad, with all
the monies going to RAG. Travelling in
London can be a bitch, so why not treat
yourself to a new bicycle and lose that
holiday weight?
On Wednesday 27th Imperial RAG
is teaming up with Cambridge, Lough-
borough, St. George’s and a few more
to shake our buckets for charity at
our first Megaraid this year. Together
we’ll be collecting ALL DAY at Fulham
Broadway, Earls Court and Glouces-
ter Road as well as in the city centre.
It’ll be a massive event, and afterwards
everyone involved is going out! We’re
doing fancy dress, so dust off your
Halloween costumes, neon tights and
masks and join us for an epic
day! Make sure you tell your
friends. The collection will
be for Barnardo’s.
To finish off January,
we are collecting at South
Kensington Tube Station on
Saturday 30th. It’s literally a
5 minute walk from college so
2010: the year of RAG
if you feel like shaking buckets for an
hour or so let us know.
Make sure to check out this section
every week in felix to find out what
we’re up to. Keep your eyes peeled for
some great events in 2010! If you feel
like going on a collection, have any
fundraising ideas or want to be part of
the committee then e-mail us at rag@
ic.ac.uk.
FUCKIT.
FUCKIT.
