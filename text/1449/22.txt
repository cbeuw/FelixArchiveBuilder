Your sense of smell will guide you in embarking on a pilgrimage to these shrines honouring the fine art of cooking the freshest fish. Well, at least mine did.
The streets lined with Turkish Delights
I
have to say that there is no other
city like this anywhere else on
Earth. Being a city which en-
compasses both Europe and
Asia really does represent a fu-
sion of east and west, with traditional
Islamic values standing side by side
with those from neighbouring Europe.
It is also a harmony of old and new,
with a slick new tram system riding
amongst the archaic monuments of the
magnificent Hagia Sofia and the Blue
Mosque. Istanbul is fast becoming a
slick metropolis with every modern
comfort, and whilst this city spoils you
with every international cuisine you
could think of, I’m going to write about
the local food which really encapsu-
lates the spirit of this city.
I’ll start with a Turkish classic, Turk-
ish delight. You’ll find this everywhere,
and whilst most shops and market stalls
will produce those of quality exceeding
what we’d find on our British shores,
in my opinion, it’s worth checking out
a chain of shops which go by the name
of Gulluoglu, whose produce will really
get your tastebuds dancing. Try their
double pistachio delight, whose part-
nership of pistachio pieces enrobed in
a classically sweet, sugar-dusted jelly
creates a wonderful textural balance of
crunch and chew. It’s also worth giving
their baklava a try, a pastry-based des-
sert found throughout Turkey and the
Middle East. Turkish baklava differs
from Lebanese baklava in the sense
that it is richer and a tad sweeter. (This
is solid evidence that it is possible to
load something with more butter and
sugar than Lebanese baklava). More
importantly, it is vital to eat Turkish
baklava fresh, for even a few hours on
the plane will ensure that their crunch-
iness is hastily converted to sogginess.
A must try is their green diamond
shaped baklava brimming with pista-
chio tones.
Describing the street food in Istan-
bul in one word is not easy. Amazing,
divine, brilliant, all these words don’t
quite do it justice. Stroll
around the tourist or
nightlife areas and
you won’t have
to walk far for a
treat to come to
you. In winter,
freshly roast-
ed, beauti-
fully sweet
chestnuts are
on display,
whereas in
summer, a
slightly chew-
ier version
of ice cream
known as ‘don-
durma’ is a crowd
pleaser. Mussels,
stuffed with rice and
herbs are also a must try
at just 50 cents each. Or try
these shell-dwellers in deep fried
form on a skewer, whose juicy bod-
ies covered in an ever-so-light crispy
batter, laden with an aromatic but not
overpowering garlic sauce, makes for
an exceedingly mouthwatering com-

bination. And then there’s your clas-
sic kebabs, where the average doner
is something truly tasty and far less
greasy than what you’d find at your
local kebab house. But something you
really cannot afford to miss out on
is a simple fish sandwich known as
‘balik ekmek’, which can be found in
Eminonu on the European side and
in Kadikoy on the Asian side. Sold in
sandwich stalls, they are pretty
hard to miss, for your nose
will be alerted to their
presence by pick-
ing up the sweetly
seductive whiffs
of pan-seared
fish hover-
ing in the air.
Amazingly
fresh mack-
erel (you
can even
see it be-
ing fished
on nearby
bridges) is
pan fried,
placed in a
wonderfully
soft ciabatta-
like bread roll,
with onions, lettuce
and lemon juice added
to it. Fish sandwiches don’t get better
than this.
The variety of Turkish restaurants
will keep you entertained for days on
end. Gastronauts should pay culinary
homage to Ciya Sofrasi in Kadikoy,
where the proprietor (who is known lo-
cally as a culinary Indiana Jones) gath-
ers unique flavours from the frontiers
of Turkey and delivers them straight
to your plate. Some of their vegetar-
ian options really did stand out, such
as their stuffed dried vegetables, which
incorporated eggplant, rice, peppers,
mint and garlic into a uniquely enter-
taining combination. Also try some
of their desserts; their ‘sobiyet’ (green
baklava shaped as triangles) was mem-
orable and their pumpkin dessert was,
well, interesting. For a fine dining ex-
perience, head to the restaurant inside
the Topkapi Palace known as Konyali
Lokantasi, where, whilst the prices
could be a tiny bit kinder to your wallet,
the quality of their traditional Ottoman
food is certainly worth it, particularly if
you’re a fan of lamb. If you’d like some
alcohol with your cuisine then head
to the side streets off Istiklal Caddesi,
where if you eat in a type of restaurant
known as a ‘meyhane’ you’ll find ‘meze’
(small tapas-like dishes) aplenty ac-
companied by even more ‘raki’ (an ani-
seed flavoured spirit).
A hard day’s eating should be re-
warded with some relaxation, so after
satisfying your stomach, why not head
into Tophane where you can have shi-
sha (known as ‘nargile’ in Turkey) with
friendly locals and enjoy some indul-
gently sweet pistachio coffee. Or head
to a hamam, where you can get a tra-
ditional Turkish bath and massage.
I’d recommend Cemberlitas hamami,
whose stunning stone baths are the
perfect setting for a thorough cleaning
by their firm-handed staff. Just a word
of warning, such a meticulous cleaning
can hurt just a tad. To conclude, this
city will not only bring some truly sub-
lime tastes to your palette, it will also
ensure your other senses don’t feel too
left out either.
