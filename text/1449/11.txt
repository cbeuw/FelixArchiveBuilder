At the beginning of every year, many of us
make a new year’s resolution to improve
something about ourselves, try something
out or meet new people. After the initial
inspiration then comes the hard part of
actually sticking to it. This year, why not join
a club or society to help you stick to your
goals. We’ve asked clubs running taster
sessions, to tell us when and where these
are going on so that you can go along and
find out what they’re all about. So whether
it’s a case of dusting off that old instrument
you played at school or getting fit by trying
a new sport, why not start as you mean to
go on with the help and support of other
people with the same interests!
