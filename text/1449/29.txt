I think ur both disgusting. Making jokes bout
suicide bombers. Sum1 cud hav got hurt

We love hearing from the fans and have
received some really warm feedback.
Send some of your love to

“Oi! Hangman! I had the worse
Christmas in the world, and where
were you to make it better? It happens
I’m allergic to snow, indoor trees and
the glow of cheap shitty coloured LED
lights. I also have a phobia of tinsel,
so overall, Christmas was f*cking
awful. Also, my Mum died, but moreso
because of the tinsel phobia.”
However, when he doth garb himself
in trench coat and black boots, he
becomes....
This is Gaz the engineer, a simpleton
from Runcorn, codename ‘Giraffe’. He
spends most of his waking days in the
library revising for engineering tests
that he sets himself. By night, he cre-
ates zany inventions which help Xyron
to promote truth and love.
Gaz: COME IN!
Chris: You fool, Giraffe! I did not do
the correct knock. I could be an
imposter! Hasn’t federation training
taught you anything!?
Gaz: I’m sorry Chris, it won’t hap-
pen again. Just come in and look
at this.
Xyron Cubed, defender of galaxy 3.
Chris: Well aren’t you going to con-
firm that it’s actually me by re-
questing the correct door knock?
Gaz: (sighs) If you require entry to
the room please respond with the
correct passcode
Chris knocks the tune ‘One Man band’ by
Leo Sayer and enters...
Chris: There, not so hard, was it, Gi-
raffe? And don’t call me Chris, you
know it’s Xyron when I’m wearing
my trench coat.
Gaz: Sorry Xyron, but you were
behind the door so I couldn’t tell.
Chris: When I’m Chris I sound like
this, ‘Hello I’m Chris’. When I’m
Xyron, I sound like this, ‘Hello I’m
Xyron’.
Gaz: They sounded exactly the
same
Chris: But did they?
Gaz: Yes
Chris: BUT DID THEY!?
Gaz: Yes
Chris: Oh. Is my invention ready?
It is Wednesday evening. ACC Bar
Night at the Imperial College Union.
Xyron would not usually dare venture
into the territory of twats, but tonight
he plans to confess his undying love to
the girl of his dreams, and he knows
that it’s the only place to find her. Gi-
raffe has been making the finishing
touches to his latest zany invention,
‘The Confidence Belt v2.0.1!’
Chris: It is complete! Excellent
news. This way I’ll be charming
enough to woo Porsche. She’s going
to be so impressed!
Gaz: Oh please tell me your joking
Xyron. Not Porsche, the University
Slut? I’ve heard she’s been entered
by all of the Rugby boys, and has
gobbled off every left-back the
football team has ever had. She’s
even tongued the fat ugly ginger
one.
Chris: Hey don’t talk about my Por-
sche that way Giraffe! She’s just a
poor lost girl looking for a real man
to take care of her, and tonight, I
will be that man. Besides, the fat
ugly ginger one spiked her drink
again so it doesn’t count.
Gaz: Ok well whatever, I just think
you’re making a mistake. Try out the
belt, you need to check it works.
Chris: (Triumphantly) I am no longer
encumbered by my cowardly ways,
for tonight I harness the power
from the Belt of Confidence v2.0.1,
and I pledge to honour my lady by
casting asunder my imperfections.
Today the laws of love will bring
me justice.
Meanwhile, at the ACC Bar Night...
Porche
things were already getting out of hand. The enemy forces were swiftly moving in
and Porche was having fun with the Rugby lads. Is Xyron too late? Will his confi-
dence belt see him through the perils of trying to communicate with heavily in-
toxicated loud-mouthed twats? What the fuck happened to ‘Beginner’s Guides’?
