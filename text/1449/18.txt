Thank God, they got one right.
This producer and DJ is no longer
underground dubstep’s little secret and
hopefully will start getting the com-
mercial success he deserves.
Joy Orbison started DJing at the ten-
der age of 12, back when he was still
mortal and called Peter O’Grady. He
then set up his own label (Doldrums)
and has been honing his skills ever
since.
If his Fabric sets and recent releases
are anything to go by, he’s only getting
better.

18 felix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010
A
quick confession before
I continue: I spent all of
Christmas listening to
Empire of the Sun and
Passion Pit (and a little
Bing Crosby of course.) Which brings
me nicely onto the subject of this col-
umn, music snobbery.
Empire of the Sun and Passion Pit
are, here comes that dreaded word,
mainstream. They’re so mainstream
that the BBC recommended them to
“the people” in their “Sound of 2009”
list (although apparently Passion Pit
were less successful, ultimately making
them more credible; I call it the Bom-
bay Bicycle Club effect).
You’ll all have noticed the fight be-
tween people who enjoy mainstream
music and people who are repelled by
it this Christmas. It was the big thing
this winter, in one corner, “RAGE
AGAINST THE MACHINE” bellows
the announcer, and in the other corner,
“JOE MCELDERRY” (say it aloud and
you’ll realise how lame that sounds).
I’ll admit that I did buy “Killing in the
Name Of” but the whole exercise es-
sentially involved telling a large chunk
of the country, “the music that you lis-
ten to is SHIT. You don’t know REAL
music. THIS is music.”
But ultimately, as one astute ob-
server commented on felix’s last.fm
group (to break up our first online troll
war; awh) “Isn’t it funny how music is
subjective?”
In the end, people will enjoy what-
ever music they happen to enjoy and
telling people that their music isn’t as
good as the music you like is just point-
less. I can’t help but feel that the main
consequence of the RATM campaign
is that Shelter got a whole lot of money
and that every Christmas henceforth
there’s going to be a Facebook cam-
paign for some old and distinctly un-
chrismassy song.
However, being snobby about mu-
sic can be fun sometimes, like when
you’ve heard about a band way before
anyone else. In light of this revelation,
here are the bands that I knew about
before anyone else (kind of):
The xx
Mumford & Sons
Florence & The Machine
On the other hand, there are bands
that I’ve listened to way after anyone
else. Wild Beasts are a case in point.
They released their album “Two
Dancers” last year, we were sent the
album for review and we even printed
a review of said album. And I still didn’t
listen to it (I didn’t write the review).
But I have listened to it now and
for all those people who don’t already
know about Wild Beasts (very few I
imagine) I give my humble recomen-
dations that you look them up. Hear
past the melodic falsetto vocals and
you’ll notice how deliciously dark and
weird the lyrics are.
Just to redeem myself slightly, the
mixtape that Four Tet gave out at his
last DJ set at Plastic People is now on
the internet, google “Four Tet - Much
Love to the Plastic People”. Also Jamie
from The xx has released a dubstep
remix of Basic Space, it’s called “Space
Bass” They’re both worth checking out.
But you probably already know that.

The BBC’s
Sound of 2010
Greg Power and Hugh Crail take a look
at a few of the artists that will likely (and
depressingly depending on your tastes) be
heading the charts in the coming year
Joy Orbison
Gold Panda
Gold Panda is a Japan-obsessed, left-
field, electronic artist who stands out
from the BBC’s selection by being truly
original.
Lacking in mainstream appeal, his
songs combine samples taken from
charity shop VHS cassettes with low-
key moody backing akin to Four Tet.
Perhaps the most important find
on this list, he may not find fame and
chart success in 2010 (his myspace
doesn’t display the marks of an intense
PR push) but I bet he will be around
much longer than most of the artists
that made it onto this list.
Devlin
It was bound to happen: the BBC found
the Eminem of grime! By that I mean an
angry little white dude with mad flow.
The beats are fast, the music is men-
acing and there’s obviously lots of vio-
lent lyrics, some witty ones too. But
there’s nothing here that Wiley ain’t
done before.
But if you’re not already massively
into grime, why would you be remotely
interested in Devlin? Oh wait… ‘cos
he’s white. Thanks for treating us like
retards, BBC.
Ellie Goulding
The latest in the relentless wave of
young female singer songwriters, like
a zombie invasion with too much hair-
spray and 80’s shoulder pads… and I’m
pretty sure you can only kill them by
removing the head.
I probably wouldn’t be too offended
by Ms Goulding (she just follows in the
hardly original footsteps of Little Boots
without adding to or taking anything
away from the formula) except she’s
recorded a horrible cover of Bon Iver’s
“Wolves” with shallow electronically
distorted vocals... kill me please.
The Drums
The Drums are the NME’s tip for 2010
and like most of NME’s tips, they have
a hollow look in their eyes and sound a
lot like The Smiths.
These New York ‘cool kids’ who
sing about surfing are probably some
record label’s attempt at filling the time
between now and the next MGMT
album.
They’ll probably turn out like their
comrades in catchy whistling: Peter,
Bjorn and John, and disappear after
their one song is released about 4 times.
Owl City
He has 20 million plays on myspace
by re-imagining The Postal Service
through the eyes of cretin.
He’s already had a Number 1 song in
America so we’ve really got to hand it
to the BBC for spotting him.
This man is an idiot, one of his lyr-
ics is as follows: ’10 million fireflies,
I’m weird cause I hate goodbyes.’ See?
Idiot.
If you have never listened to Postal
Service then you probably won’t un-
derstand the urge I have to track him
down and punch him in the ovaries.

Daisy Dares You
The BBC wants us to believe that “Bub-
blegum punk” is the sound of 2010. Se-
riously? This is a fucking joke.
This preppy sixteen year old sounds
like Avril Lavigne with a guitar rammed
up her ass.
Seriously there’s nothing to say here.
I’d rather receive a fisting by twelve
coked-up baboons than listen to her
shitty auto-tuned tween angst ever
again.
IT’S ALREADY BEEN DONE! IT
WASN’T EVEN THAT GOOD FIRST
TIME AROUND!
I’m coming to accept
the inevitable fact that
Radiohead might end up
being Number 1 every
single week. If it continues
I’m just going to print the
chart from 2-11, which this
week would mean Kings of
Leon sneaking in... mmm
maybe I won’t then.
