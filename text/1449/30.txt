SPORT
Welcome back! A new year, and a new
term, are upon us, and 2010 promises
to be a massive one in terms of sport.
For starters, the winter Olympics
are set to kick off in Vancouver next
month.
From skiing to figure skating (not
forgetting everyone’s favourite sport,
curling), it should be a month of diz-
zying stuff in chilled conditions-and
that’s just the Jamaican bobsled team.
My special mention goes to the Gha-
naian alpine skier, Kwame Nkrumah-
Acheampong, nicknamed “the Snow
Leopard”. He’s Ghana’s first ever par-
ticipant at a winter Olympics, but
picked up skiing in…Milton Keynes.
Oh, and he was a safari guide before
that. Some people, I swear…Before
you know it, he’ll be a champion base-
jumper after trying it once in Watford,
or something.
He’s not the only African to be in the
sporting spotlight this year. The Af-
rican Cup of Nations is going on this
week and next, and is generating much
interest in the run up to the football
World Cup held in South Africa. Some
pundits think this is the year an Afri-
can team could go all the way, on their
own continent…but the likes of the
Ivory Coast and Cameroon will have to
deal with heavyweights such as Brazil,
England and favourites Spain.In any
case, spectacle awaits. The World Cup
rarely disappoints.
Another first this year is the initial
Youth Olympic Games, to be held in
Singapore this summer. I suppose it’s
a chance for all the young’uns to strut
their stuff on an international stage,
and you never know, we might get
to see the next Bolt-in-the-making.
Some of the participants will definitely
turn up in the London games in two
years time, so be sure to keep an eye on
the small city-state come August.
Closer to home, a new term means
it’s time to run off all that turkey/
Christmas pudding/mince pie ingested
during the holidays and get back down
to business.
The various leagues continue, and
pretty soon all the cup matches will
kick off, leading to the BUCS champi-
onship finals in Sheffield towards the
end of term. Not to mention this year’s
Varsity, which will be bigger than ever.
Looking at the felixSport league ta-
ble, the men’s volleyball and women’s
fencing teams are as yet unbeaten.
Let’s hope that run of form continues;
having said that, I wish the best of luck
to each and every one of our teams.
Keep doing your best, keep having
fun; most importantly, don’t forget to
write match reports and take plenty of
pictures so we can tell everyone about
your glorious victories (or not-so-glo-
rious defeats-we want everything).
Thanks to everyone who sent some-
thing in last term. We need your words,
and if we haven’t got anything to put in
you’ll be subjected to more of this...so
for everyone’s sake, help us out! We’re
also working on making felixSport that
much more interesting, so look out for
upcoming sports features and inter-
views with the people who make Im-
perial’s clubs tick.
Right, that’s done, I think I might go
for a run now. That is, once it stops
snowing.
