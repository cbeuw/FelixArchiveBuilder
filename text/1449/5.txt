Many of Imperial’s 2nd year Biologists
have found their efforts to be in vain
this New Year as their department has
confirmed the retraction of course-
work marks. This comes after students
used past assessments to gain what the
Biology department deemed an unfair
advantage.
Students are up in arms as the de-
partment tries to blame the students
for contravening course regulations,
but the department has been heavily
criticised for not producing new ques-
tions for graded coursework assess-
ments each year.
The majority of students on the
mandatory Applied Molecular Biol-
ogy (AMB) module have found their
coursework marks severely down-
graded after three completed and sub-
mitted coursework assessments were
removed from the syllabus with imme-
diate effect.
After marks for these grades sud-
denly disappeared from Blackboard,
the department’s intranet system, staff
sent out an email to all second year
students on 21st December justifying
the removal. It stated there was “un-
equivocal evidence of widespread pla-
giarism” and on Registry’s advice they
were voiding the given grades for two
Problem Based Learning practicals
and another online assessment.
Problems for the Biology depart-
ment started when students did the
obvious thing when it comes to exams
and used last year’s questions and an-
swers to help them revise for the three
multiple-choice question tests. Com-
bined they were originally worth 50%
of the module’s coursework mark, but
weighting has since dramatically been
adjusted.
Students who were genuinely using
past years’ assessments as a revision-
aid were pleasantly surprised to find
out that all three tests used recycled
questions from previous years.
AMB assessments took place
throughout the module‘s duration
which was convened for 6 weeks from
the start of the academic year in Oc-
tober. Students have been flooding
Recycled questions rile students
the discussion forums on Blackboard
since they arrived back at College for
the new term.
One student wrote: “Grades change
significantly [sic] for some of us who
didn’t cheat and this is totally unfair.”
The dramatic drop in percentage
mark for many of the affected stu-
dents was caused when only nine
questions from all three assessments
were deemed except from the retrac-
tion. The nine questions were the only
fresh questions used for this year, and
now disproportionately equate to a
decreased 25% of the Applied Molecu-
lar Biology coursework. One biologist
was astonished at his new percentage
mark.
“I went from a 2:1 to a fail! 25% of
the coursework can make or break the
final module grade at the end of the
year.”
As felix spoke to biologists in the
Sir Alexander Fleming Building, they
were mostly annoyed at their depart-
ment’s behaviour during this debacle.
2nd Year Biology Representative
Alan Itakura said “I think the students
feel there is a general lack of concern
for their well-being from the biology
staff. The decision to revoke the marks
was not well thought out. There is no
reason that new questions cannot be
made every year for each assessment,
and if, for whatever reason, that new
questions are not made,
there is no

Lord Mandelson, Secretary of State
for Business, Innovation and Skills has
announced a £398 million budget cut
for UK universities for the 2010/2011
financial year. The prominent Lord
has also asked universities to protect
the quality of, and access to, higher
education.
Lord Mandelson has further stated
that last year’s U-turn on extra places
was “responding to the particular
needs of the time” and will not be re-
peated in 2010-11. Universities are giv-
en quotas for the maximum number of
home students that they are allowed to
admit each year to each department,
and Lord Mandelson says some have
recruited more than their share. £3,700
per student will be reclaimed in each
such case, which the million+ group of
universities estimates will cost £60m
overall.
David Willetts, who shadows Lord
Mandelson commented that “we now
have the bizarre situation that uni-
versities are being fined for meeting
targets set by this government…un-
like the government we don’t believe
in artificial targets. Our view is that
higher education should be available
to all those who are qualified by abil-
ity and attainment to pursue them and
who wish to do so.” One reason for the
surge in demand for university places
is thought to be lack of paid employ-
ment opportunities for young people
in the current climate.
“Areductioninthepublicfundingper
student could seriously threaten our
ability to offer the high-quality experi-
ence our students deserve and expect,”
said Professor Steve Smith, president
of Universities UK, an organisation for
UK university vice-chancellors.
However, Higher Education Minister
David Lammy defended the cuts say-
ing, “this government recognises that
a high quality student experience with
excellent teaching and research is vital
to maintaining the world-class higher
education we enjoy in this country
today. Fast-track, part-time and two-
year degrees do not represent a reduc-
tion in quality in the higher education
offer, but an increase in choice for the
would-be learner…it was not a ques-
tion of whether efficiencies should be
made, but of where the efficiencies
should be found.”
The cuts include £84 million from
buildings and equipment, and £51
million from teaching. However, a
promise of a £109 million increase in
research funding will be kept.
The government is also planning to
try out two-year bachelor’s degrees as
a way of reducing costs and appealing
to a wider range of backgrounds.
Meanwhile, Scotland’s SNP Govern-
ment has promised a real terms in-
crease of 2.1% in its universities budget.

Union Building vandalised for upteenth time
Imperial College Union’s main build-
ing in Beit Quadrangle has been sub-
ject to unlawful entry and vandalism
once again. The latest occurrence hap-
pened out of term time on the 22nd of
December at around 2.25am.
Security staff found a cabinet in the
Snooker Club’s allocated room to be
defaced and damaged. A snooker ta-
ble was also found to be covered in
an energy drink given free to clubs
and societies.
This break-in is in a long line of
attempts to enter the Union Build-
ing with criminal intent.
In the two weeks leading up to No-
vember 17th 2009, the Union Building
was damaged six times by unknown
assailants, which included the removal
of doors from their hinges and multi-
ple panes of glass smashed.
Last year, the Union offices were bur-
gled on several occasions and several
items of considerable expense were
stolen.
With previous counts, circumstanc-
es have been hazy regarding how and
who was involved, and once again the
Union’s security lapses have created a
shocking amount of uncertainty to this
round of vandalism that will undoubt-
edly cost the Union to rectify.
Security staff have indicated that
poorly positioned CCTV footage
merely shows the top of the guilty par-
ty’s heads as they escaped out of the
Union’s rear exit, and hence is useless.
They also stated that the police have
been informed but are yet to follow up
on the initial report.
Access was gained via the East en-
trance door that leads to the Union
Bar and eastern stairwell. The door is
left unlatched out of working hours to
provide local bus drivers access to the
toilet facilities during the night.
This seemingly naive procedure was
easily taken advantage of and led to the
snooker room’s vandalism.
Union President Ashley Brown has
since confirmed that College are “un-
derway with a security review” of the
Union, and are “in the process of get-
ting quotes for more CCTV cameras
and card readers.”
In light of CCTV’s failure, it looks
like an old-fashioned crime-solving de-
tective like Sherlock Holmes is needed.
felix is sure he could make much
more out of the comical Digestive
biscuit-crumb trail left from the East
stairwell to the snooker rooms and out
again.

£2 million revamp but do we deserve it?
On Tuesday 17th November, ICU Presi-
dent, Ashley Brown, met with College’s
Portfolio Review Board to discuss fund-
ing for phase 3 of the union redevelop-
ment. Phases 1 & 2 have been relatively
dull for the average student; phase 1 saw
a new lift and dodgy wiring being fixed
in the union and phase 2 was respon-
sible for the union offices and the stu-
dent activities centre being moved up a
few floors and a new gym in the union.
Phase 3 is set to be completed in time
for freshers week 2010 and includes
major changes to the area dearest to
students’ hearts; the bar! The union bar
is likely to be largely unchanged; neat-
ening up the floor and ceiling as well as
installing air conditioning.
Meanwhile, Da Vinci’s and dB’s both
look set for a radical overhaul; regard-
ing the current configuration of the
bars Ashley told felix: “The problem
with da Vinci’s is that it’s just too nar-
row, the lino floors are horrible and
the catering area is a complete waste
of space in the evening, reducing the
useable length of the bar.” When asked
about the furniture in da Vinci’s, in-
troduced in a minor refurbishment in
2006, Ashley agreed they’re not really
fit for purpose and are far less robust
than hoped- the tendency for legs to
fall off the tables isn’t ideal. However
he maintained the considerations be-
hind the furniture are still valid: “fur-
niture in da Vinci’s needs to be robust,
perhaps the style should be more
like what’s currently in dB’s, but with
longer tables so that a whole team can
gather around one and the furniture
should survive outside use, making the
space more flexible.” One suggestion
for solving the problem of the unsocia-
ble shape of da Vinci’s is to knock out
the current catering space changing
the configuration to increase efficiency
and improve the layout of the bar.
ICU’s ‘club’ dB’s suffers from a poor
layout which makes it difficult to reach

the bar and therefore uninviting to the
casual drinker. As part of an effort to
make dB’s a more inviting entertaining
space, the entire quad is likely to be re-
modelled and the popular awnings re-
positioned in order to make better use
of covered outside space.
Initial plans for phase 3 were pro-
duced when work began in 2006, the
Union realise this refurbishment is a
massive undertaking which can only
be done every fifteen years or so it’s
essential to get it right. Temporary, ill-
planned solutions have resulted in the
current poor use of space, so the Un-
ion are consulting professional design-
ers and students on how best to use the
space.
Major work to da Vinci’s and dB’s will
set the Union back around £2 million,
Tuesdays meeting left Ashley con-
firmed the project will go ahead with
funds raised between College, Union
reserves and a loan to the Union from
college, meaning the Union are happy
press ahead with plans for phase 3.
Excitement over plans for phase
3 has been somewhat soured by
evening revelry resulting in around
£2000 worth of damage to the Union
building over the last two weeks. Last
Wednesday several panes of glass
in ground floor doors and windows
were broken and a door to the Un-
ion offices was damaged, on Friday
night the door to the toilet in dB’s
was pulled off its hinges and this
Wednesday a door near to the Ladies
toilets was damaged to the point that
it will be completely replaced. Talking
about the recent damage, Ashley told
felix: “General wear and tear should
be expected but this much damage
in a few days makes you wonder why
we bother, covering the cost of this
damage is equivalent to 10% on the
price of drinks.”Acknowledging that
the damage is caused by a minority of
‘drunk, stupid people’, Ashley’s mes-
sage to students is: “If you see some-
one you know damaging Union prop-
erty, tell them to pack it in!”

Lord Mandelson wonders where the steering wheel is in his car
reason that the students should take
the hit for it.”
Despite the department considering
the use of past questions and answers
as against course regulations, some
people have suggested this logic is
flawed. Students were encouraged to
consult their peers in answering the
two Problem Based Learning assess-
ments in which they could freely revisit
the online test within a time period of
one week. ‘Peers’ would have included
students repeating their second year,
and hence the recycled assessment
questions would have allowed these
students, doing the exact same test
twice, to be unfairly at a distinct advan-
tage to their first-time counterparts.
Even more embarrassment has been
piled onto the department after one
student revealed they had been initially
congratulated by staff on their excellent
grades; the AMB coursework is known
to be notoriously difficult amongst 2nd
and 3rd years. The department is said
to have been notified of the use of past
assessments by students unhappy that
their fellow biologists had used past
years’ scripts, and subsequently taken
the action that has angered many.
Whether or not the students were
right to use past assessments to com-
plete an open assessment, it seems the
Biology department has been naive to
think their students would not track
down previous assessments from elder
years, to revise from or otherwise.
