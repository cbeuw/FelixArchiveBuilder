ICURFC Canada Tour 2006
This July saw 25 of Imperial Col-
lege’s rugby club head to western
Canada in search of fame, fortune,
glory and perhaps a little liquor. The
tour began in Edmonton. Stepping
off the plane into blistering heat
we realised that things may not be
quite as straight forward as we had
hoped. However, rugby boys being
rugby boys, little time was wasted
in exploring the local taverns and
eateries, despite our first match be-
ing the following day.
The second evening presented us
with our first fifteen a side match, a
game that we were told was against
a team made up of a mixture of play-
ers from the local clubs. It just so
happened that this representative
team was the Edmonton Gold, a Ca-
nadian Super League team who fin-
ished second this year. The team in
front of us contained an awful lot of
talented looking players, including
several internationals such as the
Canadian try scoring record holder
Dave Lougheed and ex Leicester
Tigers winger Winston Stanley.
However, we started with optimism
and found ourselves only four tries
to two down at the half, thanks to
some great play from the half back
pairing of Rob Robinson and Jim
Pedder. A lack of fitness and match
practice as well as extreme condi-
tions drain saw IC walking off af-
ter 80 minutes of fast paced rugby
and a comprehensive drubbing at
the hands of Edmonton. The game
ended, 57-12. The score line does
not reflect how we had played in the
match, and in fact there were hints
of potential in the scratch squad
comprised of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even
4th team players.
Having enjoyed a few more days
in Edmonton the journey south to
Calgary was made for another fif-
teen a side match, the first sevens
tournament and of course the leg-
endary Calgary Stampede. It was
business as usual for the lads as we
explored Calgary, but we were a lit-
tle more wary for our match against
the Calgary Irish after our lesson in
Edmonton. The match looked like
it may not have gone ahead, with a
fierce thunder storm raging above
our heads and interrupting play
minutes in, but eventually it got un-
derway. The Irish took advantage
of the rain delay and immediately
pushed over for a try from a lineout.
This sparked IC into life and start-
ed a very tight match, dominated
by forward play due to the stormy
conditions. This limited IC’s attack,
being out muscled up front and un-
able to play the fast running rugby
we wanted. A solitary try came from
Quincy Allen intercepting a miss
pass from the Irish 10 and running
to the line. The score in the end was
12-7, but we left feeling that it was
a match we could and should have
won.
Next was the sevens tournament
at the Stampede Sevens. The IC
first squad qualified for the semi
finals having put out the previous
year’s champions. This led to a
match against a side from British
Columbia, Meraloma. After a half of
possibly the best sevens ever played
by an IC side we led 25-0, however
a Meraloma fight back saw them
score three tries leaving the score
at 25-19 with only a couple of min-
utes to play. But IC always looked in
control and victory seemed secure
when Robinson crossed the line
late on, only for his try to be disal-
lowed for time wasting after pres-
sure on the referee from the Mer-
aloma coach. This let Meraloma
back in the game and a converted
try in the last play handed them
victory, much to the dismay of the
tour party. Meraloma went on to
meet our old friends the Edmonton
Gold in the final where they were
comprehensively beaten. However
revenge would be had on Meraloma
before the tour ended. A further
couple of days were had in Calgary
enjoying the stampede and rodeo,
a highlight of the tour for many, as
well as a great final night in Cow-
boys. A special mention has to be
said for Rob Gaskell and the luge at
Daniel Lindsley

only Rob survived.
The next five days were rugby
free, spent in the glorious surround-
ings of the Rockies. One night was
spent in the middle of nowhere at
Canmore before moving on to Banff
where the lads enjoyed white-water
rafting, mountain biking, canoeing
and the surroundings of the Lake
Louise as well as the never ending
hospitality of the Banff locals. Af-
ter Banff we started the long jour-
ney to Vancouver with one night’s
stopover at Shuswap Lake, where
accommodation was in the form of
Cabooses (railway carriages) and
a boat house. We enjoyed an open
campfire, local beer and a few of the
guys sweated in a traditional Native
American sauna before an invigor-
ating swim in the ice cold lake.
The last week of the tour was
spent on the west coast at Vancou-
ver and Victoria. Our final fifteen a
side match was to be against Capi-
lano, a top ranked British Columbia
side. The game saw the best rugby
played all tour, with the forwards
fronting up against physically big-
ger and stronger opposition and
the backs running fantastic lines.
The game was close throughout
but first half scores from Quincy
Allen and Rob Gaskell gave us the
edge heading into half time before
Jim Pedder stretched the lead soon
after the break with a run from
halfway. Capilano scored two of
their own before Raphael Diguisto
put the game beyond doubt with
another try under the posts. The fi-
nal score was 24-12, testament to a
squad that had developed through-
out the tour to become a very good
outfit. Choruses of Sylvia were sung
with gusto and new songs were
learnt thanks to the good lads from
the Capilano side. Be warned, those
of a sensitive disposition may need
to cover their ears next term as the
rugby boys sing the S&M man.
After another few days R&R at
Victoria on Vancouver Island, where
the traditional Kangaroo Court was
held – much to the amusement of
the Canadian locals, it was time to
head back to Vancouver and the
twenty fifth Simon Fraser Univer-
sity Sevens tournament, where our
old enemies Meraloma lay in wait.
Again the first squad looked in good
form heading to a meeting with
Meraloma. Rob Robinson looked
to seek some personal revenge
against the side that denied him at
the previous tournament scoring all
five of the tries in a 27 to 12 victory.
This time we reached the final, los-
ing out in a close encounter to the
Bayside islanders, a team made up
of Fijians that had won the tourna-
ment a total of 17 times.
That was the final night of a tour
that had been successful on and
off the pitch. Western Canada had
proven a tough rugby test for IC but
it certainly was an enjoyable one.
