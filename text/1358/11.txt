Young Knives stab eardrums
Where other more reputable newspapers praise The Young Knives album, we slate it
Warp electronic album actually good
Warp is one of the world's best-
known and most respected labels,
and has consistently put out records
over the last decade that have come
to be looked on as genre standards;
c.f. Aphex Twin, Autechre, Black
Dog. Whoever sits and listens to
demos at Warp has got to have
golden ears.
In the last couple of years, we've
seen a diversification in Warp's
output. Gone are the faceless elec-
tronic stars of the early 90s, and in
come signings like Maximo Park.
At the same time, new electronic
releases have been faltering, with
only Jamie Lidell in recent years
managed to bust through the ob-
scureness barrier and get some
mainstream press inches (he was
in the Observer Music Monthly,
f'god's sake). The underground
stuff has left a lot to be desired,
with Black Dog's newie just rehash-
ing early Black Dog (man, that stuff
sounds dated) rather than attempt-
ing some kind of new shit.
Chris Clark isn't exactly unknown,
and Warp devotees are sure to have
his back catalogue. I'll confess to be-
ing a relative virgin when it comes
to Clark, so don't expect a lot of in-
formed piffle about "oh, he's moved
on, this is new, blah blah fucking
blah." Here's the one-liner, so those
impatient internet-grabbers among
you can go ahead and queue it up in
your Bittorrent clients; this record
is a fucking stormer.
Clark's motif is big, crackly synths,
huge hiphop breaks, and a dash of
DSP crunch. The opener, Herr Bar,
rides stuttering, chunky beats with
pretty xylophone patterns, with a
middle eight whose burbling synths
recall Nathan Fake's My Bloody
Valentine impression. Just when
you're happily bobbing around on
your chair, Clark cracks open the
track with swathes of white noise
surrounding the already dancefloor
humping beats.
In a similar vein is the superb
Vengeance Drools, which is crying
out for an MC like Ghostface Kil-
lah, or maybe Aesop Rock, to come
along and throw some reasonably
intelligent gangsta flow over the
top. Setting filmic strings atop a
clunky vintage drum loop, Clark ex-
pertly conjures up bad boys cruis-
ing the city at night, top down.
He isn't all crotch-grabbing, pos-
turing beats, though – a few tracks
eschew beats entirely, and come
out sounding like Tim Hecker with
a taste for melancholic melodies.
Frau Wav flirts with jazz breaks at
times, but drifts almost arhythmica-
ly around big (yet far from cheesy)
violins and broken, fuzzed out ana-
log synths. Springtime Epigram
fixates on a burbling sine wave
and microshifts in the surround-
ing sounds to create its reflective,
almost morbid mood.
I dropped in a facile comment
about cruising round a city at night,
butthere'sactuallyanundercurrent
of city nightlife about this record -
in the same way that dubstep has
taken the UK garage sound and
pushed it out into darker territory,
incorporating dance and hiphop ele-
ments along the way, Clark's record
draws together a veritable shedload
of genres and shoehorns them into
his own dark vision. The papable
sense of tension about most of the
tracks, and the sheer overwhelm-
ing darkness of the record, conjure
up the essence of urban decay, of
a city lit up at night by neon glow.
I'm reminded of the recent fuss sur-
rounding the Burial record; this is
actually a much better representa-
tion of late night London than the
overhyped dubstep release.
My final words are reserved for
the last track on the album, the epic
(in a good way) Autumnal Crash.

W
elcome to the
second music
section of the
year. I didn’t get
many objections
to the album list last week so I as-
sumed that I am 100% correct. I for
one am not sure about this.
Anyway, this week I wish to tell
of the wonder of FREE CDs and
FREE GIGS. I repeat, FREE CDs
and FREE GIGS. If you would
like FREE CDs and FREE GIGS
then come along to our Music
Felix meeting. This meeting will
take place today (Thursday 5th
October) at 12noon in Da Vinci’s
or some part of the union. There
is a picture above of me so that
you have a visual reference. I also
have said FREE CDs in my hands.
If you can’t make it to the meeting
and haven’t tracked us down at the
Freshers’ Fair then e-mail us (look
at the top of the page).
Also this week we have two al-
bum reviews. One of these albums
is already out and available for
your consumption; the Clark album
is brand spanking new. In this
music section we like to be contro-
versial so we gave a good review to
a new Warp electronic album and a
bad review to The Young Knives al-
bum. It would be good to get feed-
back from other people who have
heard these albums so that we can
get a discussion going. What we
say shouldn’t be the be-all and end-
all, so we want to know what you
think about these albums.
We are also helping to organise
an event in the union. This will be
next Friday, which is October 13th.
Union Events are providing two
acts who are called Ross Copper-
man and Rushmore.
Ross Copperman has been
receiving some attention recently
from the radio and is touring uni-
versities across the country. Along
with these two bands, we at the
music section have selected a band
called The Sailplanes. This band
sound somewhere between Sonic
Youth and Sleater Kinney. We like
the sound of them and hope you
will too. Watch this space for more
information.
Also look out for Alternative Mu-
sic Society nights on October 12th
and 21st. On October 12th there
are four acts with a beautiful, me-
lodic edge and it will £1 entry and
free for members of the society. Go
listen and enjoy!
Maybe I should cheer up; it could
be worse. If I’m given an album
featuring a brightly dressed farmer
standing alongside a man made
entirely of straw, I should be grate-
ful that I’m not reviewing “Generic
Indie-Rock Group (Number 107)”,
whose style consists entirely of tat
from Camden Market in an entirely
witless and unoriginal attempt to
be edgy, with music to match.
So here we have the debut full al-
The Young Knives
Voices of Animals and Men
(Transgressive)
bum from Oxford-based The Young
Knives, and past form initially re-
vealed a band which is lively and
fun. Unfortunately, for the main
part, this album is anything but.
When you press play, you’re greet-
ed with a drum crash which fills
the headphones. Good start. From
there it’s all very much downhill.
Like most bands of the moment,
the music consists solely of choppy
guitars bereft of any rhythm, melo-
dy or originality in a crass attempt
to copy the post-punk era. Lyrically,
it’s nothing exciting; in fact it’s just
plain lazy.
Lead singer Henry Dartnall just
barks out almost randomly-com-
posed lines, consisting of three
words each with no poetic cohesion
whatsoever. When he can’t be both-
ered it generally degrades to shout-
ing the same thing over and over in
an effort to fill airtime.
The early songs are full of faults;
an attempt at humour in the opener
Part Timer – where the music stops
andthebanddiscusswhattodonext
mid-song – falls flat, mainly due to
the weakness of the surrounding
elements. A crack at evoking the
spirit of Syd Barrett-esque whimsy
suffers from the general malaise in
the lyrics. Some interesting guitar
work pops out in Mystic Energy but
then mutates into sub-Sonic Youth
noise. Whilst taking this in, I can-
not help but think that if you give
a three-year-old a Tommy Tutone
and record what happens, it would
be more complex then this. Some
of it is catchy; but then again so is
syphilis.
Halfwaythrough,however,there’s
a glimmer of hope. After the rocker
Here Comes the Rumour Mill,
there’s the delight that is Tailors.
Taking the rather esoteric noise of
scissors cutting as its basis, along
with a doleful acoustic guitar, this
simple track about haberdashery is
one of the rare moments where the
whimsy pulls off. Topped off with
Henry Dartnall's delicate vocals,
you’re left with something truly
mystical. The surreal Half Timer
leads into the genuinely funny She’s
Attracted To, showing that when
they put the effort in, The Young
Knives can be a stand-out band.
Besides, I defy anyone to not crack
up at a song which starts “Who are
these people? They are too stupid
to be your real parents!”
After that it falls back to the same
state as before, albeit with some
melody and the surprising heart-
felt Loughborough Suicide. I’m not
going to explain the album further;
trees have been killed to create this
newspaper and I’m not letting their
pulp be used in vain.
Despite some promising mo-
ments The Young Knives have
showed themselves to be another
sub-standard band with few ideas.
If I hear another release like this
soon – which is likely – I’ve a feel-
ing my brain will melt. Or maybe I
should cheer up; it could be worse.

fect formula; emotive, overdriven
Rhodes chords, and a skittering,
thundering breakbeat, building up-
wards and onwards with ever-thick-
ening washes of static and faraway
city samples, gradually losing all
coherence and crashing into thick,
Hecker-like washes of reverb.
I love this record. I love the op-
pressive aura. I love the dark, in-
strumental hiphop influence (yeah,
like Prefuse). I love the incredibly
detailed production that almost,
almost lets the tracks overflow the
speakers and set them crackling.
Most of all, I love that the album
flows almost perfectly – from the
wake-up call of Herr Bar to the
gentle fade-out of Autumnal Crash
– this feels like a perfectly formed
piece. This thing was made for
night listening with headphones.
