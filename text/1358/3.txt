President is the only student that
sits on College Council, his word
was trusted. Unfortunately,
this has left the names of
the constituent faculty un-
ions in disarray.
The RCSU, CGCU and
ICSMSU names were
chosen through student
referenda, and have strong
historical significance. In
the College Centenary
year, in which the College
is attempting to attract do-
nations from alumni (many
of whom have strong fac-
ulty affiliations), some have
questioned the wisdom of
this rejection. It is likely that
campaigns will take place
this coming year to attempt to
reverse the ruling.
ICFoNSSA (Imperial College Fac-
ulty of Natural Sciences Students
Association) and ICSMSU
becomes ICFoMSA
(Imperial College Fac-
ulty of Medicine Stu-
dents Association).
The last time
the names
were taken to
the Council,
the infamous
Mustafa Arif
was Presi-
dent. He
reported
back to Un-
ion Council that
the names had been
accepted - however, the
reality was that the names
had been rejected. As the
New NUS Extra card
The National Union of Students
(NUS) have scrapped discounts on
their card, which is freely available
to all students of affiliated student
unions, and introduced a new paid-
for “Extra” card that carries the
discount capability.
The NUS Extra card costs £10,
and can only be purchased by stu-
dents of a union which is fully af-
filiated with the NUS. The income
from sales of the card is divided
between the NUS and the affiliated
union, with £4 being received by
the union for each card sold. When
students buy the Extra card, they
also receive an International Stu-
dent Identity Card (ISIC), issued
by the International Student Travel
Confederation (ISTC). This popular
card is accepted internationally as
proof of student status, and gives
the holder discounts on travel, hos-
tels, hotels, restaurants and attrac-
tions, as well as providing access
to the services that ISTC provides,
such as a 24 hour emergency hel-
pline for students abroad. Bought
separately, the card costs £7.
Ben Harris, Deputy President
(Education & Welfare), has said to
Felix that the annual cost of mem-
bership of the NUS would be “about
£30,000”, but that the amount could
vary, though it would rise no higher
than £50,000. Imperial College has
around 11,000 students; should,
say, 50% of these students decide
to purchase the “Extras” card, this
will bring the Union an additional
£22,000 in revenue from the com-
mission on card sales, thus reduc-
ing the net amount the Union would
be paying the NUS to around £8,000,
if Mr. Harris’ ballpark figure is to be
believed.
The card was initially trialled
at thirteen Student Unions in the
northwest of England during the
academic year of 2005-6, and follow-
ing a decision made at the NUS An-
nual Conference in April, the card
is due to launch nationally for 2006-
7. The results from the original
pilot scheme in the northwest can
be found on the NUS online sup-
port site: www.officeronline.co.uk.
However, it is restricted to those
who are registered with the NUS
and so non-members of the NUS
cannot see the results, and hence
reporters at Felix were unable to
view these as well. Deputy Presi-
dent (Education & Welfare), Ben
Harris, also could not gain access
and would not be able to use this
information in any campaign mate-
rial provided to students during the
upcoming referendum.
The old and free card is now
known as the Democracy Card and
it denotes membership of the local
and national union. It only provides
access to “democratic processes
and to some areas of nusonline.
co.uk” without any discounts avail-
able with it. The card can be pur-
chased online, but only at those
universities that have chosen to
participate in the scheme.
NUS claim to be committed to the
smooth transition of the NUS Extra
scheme and will keep members up-
dated with the “latest information,
case studies and updates.” King’s
CollegeLondonStudentUnionisdo-
ing it’s utmost to promote the card
but it has found some hostility with
other unions. Clare Solomon, SOAS
officer, said to London Student that
the scheme “…totally contradicts
both our value statements and our
ethical supplier policy.” This was in
reference to the companies provid-
ing the discounts being large busi-
nesses, which “…make too much
profit.”
The introduction of the card has
prompted questions about the state
of the NUS’ finances. A report sub-
mitted by Salford University’s Un-
ion President, Stephanie Walker,
submitted to USSU Council, states
that in the year 2004-5, the NUS was
indebted to the tune of £700,000, and
was suffering an annual shortfall of
£200,000. Various measures have
been enacted in order to attempt
to reduce costs, such as relocating
to the northwest, and selling offices
on Holloway Road. The report also
states that the purpose of the NUS
Extra card is to “recuperate costs…
which would secure the future of
not just the NUS but individual stu-
dents’ unions as well.” The report
also contains a number of interest-
ing points, including the fact that af-
ter tax, VAT, and various production
costs, NUS will only receive around
£2.50 per card sold. Felix could not
gain access to this material first-
hand, as Imperial College Union is
not affiliated to NUS.
The introduction of the NUS Ex-
tra card is adding to the debate on
whether Imperial College Union
should join the NUS. Many still re-
ceive student discounts by showing
their Imperial College swipe-card
and so may see the NUS Extra as
unnecessary thus the NUS only
having national representative
benefits.
The NUS referendum is anticipat-
ed to take place in November.

JCR complete and on time
The redevelopment of the JCR finished on time, much to the relief of
the sabbs, who had been worrying that the area would not be usuable
for Freshers’ Fair. With several rooms in the Union out of use, space
for this year’s Fair has been tight. The JCR now has a brand new fast
food bar at the far end. Felix enjoyed a rather tasty burger during a
rather busy afternoon. QT’s is back, and much better looking.
Tanaka students miss Fair
Felix has learnt that students at the Tanaka Business School had
lectures scheduled from 9am until 6pm on Tuesday, forcing them to
miss the entire Freshers’ Fair. There is a College-wide agreement
in place that lectures are suspended during Freshers’ Fair. CGCU
President, James Fok, alerted the sabbaticals to the problem, but
unfortunately it was too late to take any action.
Da Vinci’s lukewarm opening
Da Vinci’s was open for Freshers’ Fair; however, the resulting decor
left something to be desired. Those responsible have insisted that
the bar is not yet finished, and that new furniture will be arriving
next week. However, freshers didn’t seem to mind, and the bar was
crammed throughout their first few days at the College. As long as a
bar is open, Felix is happy.
College rejects RCSU,
CGCU, ICSMSU names
College Council, the highest body
in the organisation, has rejected
changes to the Union constitution
in the summer vacation that would
have settled the names of the
three constituent faculties of the
Union to Royal College of Sci-
ence Union (RCSU), City &
Guilds Union (CGCU), and
Imperial College School of
Medicine Students’ Union
(ICSMSU). Any changes
to the Union constitution
must be passed by Col-
lege Council. As the
changes have been
rejected, the new
names of the faculties are
now somewhat unwieldy. C&G will
become ICFoESA (Imperial Col-
lege Faculty of Engineering Stu-
dents Association), RSCU becomes
