This is the winter of dress content
Missing fashion shows, size 00 and the end of What Not To Wear’s Trinny & Susannah… whatever next?
Another year, another set of rules
to learn. I’ve been getting rather
bored of my wardrobe recently,
same old skinny jeans with flat
shoes and variations on the theme
of a tight top. So, this year’s resolu-
tion is to wear outfits that cost no
more than £50. When I mean outfit,
I mean, shoes, underwear, top, bot-
toms, bag, jewellery, the whole fuck-
ing lot. Should be interesting and
I’m sure I’m going to end up looking
like some kook from the local mar-
ket, but at least mornings will be
filled with mental maths, (£3.99 plus
£1.50 plus…), instead of: “hmmm,
could this pink nail varnish possibly
go with my red shoes?”
I was recently given tickets to
London Fashion Week, but being a
social recluse, I decided that gal-
livanting in Yorkshire was much
more interesting. During a visit to
Whitby Abbey I instantly felt the
need to don a nice black dress and
go hunting for Dracula, strange girl
you might think, but at least the cat-
walks agree that everyone’s inner
goth should be celebrated; the Goth-
ic Look is back! But for me the look
should really be called “rock’n’roll
groupie.” Galliano’s new collection
looked more like a homage to Axl
Rose (read Oral Sex). To perfect
the look, think sliver skulls, leather
and bandanas. However, if like me
you’re on a budget, Camden Mar-
ket, famous for the weird and won-
derful, will supply your every need
for the Gothic look.
Charity shops have long been
one of my favourite haunts. I once
found a child’s old school kilt for
£1.50. It belonged to Marianne
Hartley-Brown, and every time I
wear it I wonder what she’s up to,
and whether she’d approve of her
kilt going to indie club nights and
getting drenched in beer. I haven’t
worn it for a while, due to the fact
Dolly Delaney that wearing a 7 year-olds kilt re-
stricts ones breathing somewhat
(I’m a singer, didn’t you know, and
I breathe from the diaphragm). But
the recent rise of tartan and plaid
has made me re-think. If, like me
you have the same idea, be warned.
Overdosing on the Scottish rag
could make you look like a Bay City
Rollers fan (a bad, bad thing). Keep
it simple, ie only wear kilts.
By far the best look of this sea-
son is the Tailored look. Many of
the catwalks have tried to keep it
simple, with tailored dresses and
leather gloves. But I say the more
androgynous your look the better.
Even though it pains me to say it,
Kate Moss works androgyny better
than anyone I know: grey waistcoat
avec matching suit trousers and a
crisp white shirt. But, if you aim on
becoming a Moss-follower, make
sure that the trousers fit your arse.
Many a time I’ve seen women with
saggy, unfitted bums and it looks
awful.
This is a particularly sore point
for me. I am one of those Size 00’s
and believe me, it’s crap. No I’m not
anorexic; I just have crappy genes
(or should I say jeans?). At 5”1, I
was always the smallest at school. I
gave up ballet classes, so I could be
with the rest of my year on Thurs-
day evenings; playing netball. The
worst decision of my life, as no one
passed the ball (well they couldn’t
see me) and my graceful walk start-
ed to deteriorate. But then this year,
a revolution happened. Size 00 jeans
appeared in Gap (albeit, in Japan)
and I quickly shelled out £45 to get
them. So long saggy bum, hello tight
arse! Larger people often complain
about Size 00’s, but quite frankly
they have a much better fashion life
than us. They get way more materi-
al for their money’s worth and nev-
er have to worry about their arses
filling trousers. They have wonder-
fully voluptuous breasts and are a
damn sight more intimidating that
myself when it comes to shouting at
the editor, because he won’t make
you tea. So you see, Size 00’s are the
real victims here.
If you are reading this and are ut-
terly incensed at my words because
you’re a larger woman and find it
hard to dress yourself; then never
fear. What not to wear (WNTW) is
back. However, singer Mica Paris
and “supermodel” Lisa Butcher
have replaced the duo of Trinny and
Susannah. Last weeks’ episode of
WNTW had the same format as the
last episodes T&S presented, but
I’m afraid that’s all it shared with
the former shows. The clothes were
mediocre and the advice was nei-
ther helpful, nor intelligent (flared
trousers make you look taller?!).
T&S have now moved over to the
dark side, ITV, and are presenting
their own new show. How could
they sell themselves so cheaply?
I am outraged and only hope that
they return to their rightful home
soon.
You may remember my first arti-
cle of the 2005/6 year. I talked about
the new trends of that autumn and
also about a dress. “The Galaxy”.
The dress of 2005. Many people
have called me the “Mystic Meg”
of the fashion world; some have
just called me lucky. Whatever your
stance, here are my top 5 predic-
tions for this autumn:
1) Gaucho Bag, by John Galliano
for Dior. As seen on Mischa Barton
and currently being advertised by a
make-up less Kate Moss. It’s a steal
at £915 (as in most girls will have to
steal it).
2) French Connection’s Serpent
Dress; a bronze-sequined striped
number. Every girl’s been talking
about it, but at £130 it’s time to start
getting yourself a rich and gener-
ous boy.
3) The Little Black Dress. It’s
back, it’s black and it’s strapless.
Prada have the perfect one for
£1,160.
4) Gold is lighting up the catwalks
this season, for the ultimate ghetto
chic, get down to Asda and buy a
gold dress for £14 from George!
5) Chunky knits are warming
up every the hardest of fashion’s
hearts. Stand out from the grey
crowd with Joseph’s Blue jumper,
£209.
