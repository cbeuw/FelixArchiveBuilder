If you have often sat in front of the
TV and thought to yourself that
what you are watching is actually
pretty rubbish, then you are part of
a huge society of different nationali-
ties who every day complain about
what they watch, but yet they still
watch it. If you are one of these
people, and think to yourself that
you could make a TV programme
that would be much better than
this then you need to be part of an-
other society too. I welcome you to
the Student Television of Imperial
College; we like to call it stoic tv for
short.
We at stoic tv work together as
a team to make a wide selection
of programs such as news, light
entertainment, short films, the
news, and so much more. These
are then broadcast across campus
in the Junior Common Room on
the walkway, and Da Vinci’s (from
1-2pm each day, so keep a lookout
over lunchtime!). And all our pro-
grammes (including those from the
last two years) are available 24/7 on
our website, at www.stoictv.com.
All these programmes are creat-
ed by members of our society who
are generally interested in making
a program or broadcasting in our
state of the art studio located at the
West Wing of Beit Quad. You will be
surprised to know that a lot of the
effort that goes into a successful
broadcasting is not just a good pro-
gramme idea or a good show; there
are many behind the scenes tech-
nicalities that are very interesting.
But that isn’t the only point of stoic
tv - mostly we’re seeing how much
we can get with and how many celeb
parties we can gatecrash just be-
cause we’re holding a TV camera!
We offer a range of different shows
and events throughout the year and
there are new programmes this
year too, including “Ask The Presi-
dent”, an interactive debate show
with the Union President, and a
comedy sketch show. Our live news
shows, where we keep the College
up to date with the latest goings-on
and events, are also very popular.
We’re holding a few workshops
to introduce you to our kit (which
is pretty hot), our studio, and show
you some of the stuff we have
done – from films to news – or more
importantly, what you can do. All of
us are approachable and some of us
aren’t even technical wizards – me,
for example!
There is a place here for every-
one. We need ‘front-of-camera’ peo-
ple as much as technical staff. It’s a
really good conduit for an ego that
needs a little massaging or a crea-
tive writer with a crazy idea for the
next Blair Witch Project. Alterna-
tively, if you like lots of attention be-
cause you’re holding a large piece
Hey you. Welcome to the wonderful
world of ICRadio. First things first,
throughout this I will be quoting
five songs, whoever comes to our
freshers’ beer and biscuits evening
next Monday from 6pm (we are in
Beit Quad in the basement mixing
up the medicine) with all five an-
swers first will win a mystery prize
worth around £25. Just to help I’ve
already done two of them and for
the most part do not make sense in
the sentences.
So, now for the serious stuff, we
broadcast 24/7 at www.icradio.com
and on 1134AM in Wye. We have
award-winning shows covering
more types of music than you’ve
ever heard of, from rock to pop to
hip-hop with some ska, punk and
jazz, and a whole host of speech
based programs. We run all our
training and within 3 hours can
have you presenting your own
show. In the two years I have been
doing this I have gone from pathet-
ically poor to unbelievably average,
but that’s the point: anyone can
have a go.
IC Radio gets all the latest
albums and singles before the
shops from major and independ-
ent record labels that our music
team get to review and sometimes
receive free invites to gigs. We
have top-notch DJ equipment we
hire out to other societies, clubs
and bars for events. We own a
professional level recording facility
for any band on the run to rent.
We can help you achieve your
greatest dreams, God only knows
what you’d be without us (now that
quote was quite poor and not even
correct).
We need presenters, technical
guys and gals, producers and a
bucket full of others. We welcome
any ideas and are able to make
(almost) anything happen. So get
started and you can play to the
world over and over and over and
over, like a monkey with a mini-
ature cymbal… Anyway, I’ll see you
for beer and biscuits.
If you are interested and you
darn well should be, email man-
ager@icradio.com. Oh, on more
thing, remember to check out
icradio.com – especially ‘The
Moon Unit’, IC’s premier rock and
alternative show presented by
me and my emo housemate (don’t
worry, he doesn’t get a say in what
we play!).

Watch too much television? How about you get off your backside and create it!
IC Radio
welcome
of shiny, technical material in your
hand then this is the place for you.
It’s loads of fun! Just like real TV,
we have a national awards ceremo-
ny we get to attend every year. Our
station won the Best Male, Best Fe-
male and Best Broadcaster awards
last year (so you could call us offi-
cially the best student broadcaster
in the country!) Who knows, maybe
you can help us win something next
year?
The first step to getting involved
is attending a freshers workshop
(whether you’re a fresher or not!).
If you like what you see then be-
come a member, sign up to a few
programmes or start one of your
own. There will also be more formal
training sessions so that you can
use our kit to its fullest potential.
So we look forward to seeing you
at stoic tv in the West Basement of
Beit Quad, or e-mail info@stoictv.
com for more details.
Workshops
Our renowned workshops run next
week, on both Sunday and Wednes-
day, and give you a unique introduc-
tion to the world of stoic tv, and TV
studios in general. The workshops
consist of three sessions, each last-
ing about an hour. The first two
involve producing a short light en-
tertainment programme; it tends to
be quite chaotic but it’s always good
fun. We’re not trying to produce a
BAFTA award-winning entertain-
ment show, just give you an idea of
how things work at stoic tv.
Studio
In the studio you’ll be able to have
a go at being a presenter, which is
great fun if slightly nerve-racking!
The ability to talk non-stop is help-
ful, but you are largely at the mercy
of the rest of the crew to feed you the
information you need and do what
you are expecting. There’s nothing
quite like introducing a segment
and then looking in horror into the
camera as you realise you still have
fifteen seconds left to talk.
For the more reserved among us,
why not have a go at controlling a
camera, as instructed by the pro-
gramme’s director. Or you could be
the floor manager – this person is
essentially in charge of the studio
and is responsible for making sure
everyone knows what they are do-
ing, from telling the presenters
which camera to look at to counting
into and out of video segments so
that the presenters know when to
stop and start talking.
Gallery
The gallery is the nerve centre of
any recording. It’s here that you’ll
find the boss, or the director. The
director’s job is to keep the whole
show on track from deciding what
the cameras should do to cueing in
video segments, or just telling the
presenters to wrap it up because
they’re being dull. If you like shout-
ing and bossing people around then
this is the job for you, but at the
same time you need a cool head
as you have to be thinking not just
about what is happening now, but
also about what is happening next.
The director works closely with
the vision mixer, who controls which
pictures go to tape (or to broadcast
if it’s a live show). There’s also a
sound mixer who does a similar
thing for audio, and VT operators
who play in video footage such as
music videos and interviews. They
also need to press record at the
start of the show, otherwise people
will get very upset when you tell
them that they have to it all again.
Editing
Most programmes need to go
through post-production after be-
ing recorded before they make it to
the screen. At its simplest, editing
is simply rearranging bits of video
into the right order and length.
Then you add captions, music,
graphics, special effects and more
– the list is endless. It can take a
very long time but the results can
be spectacular.
To give you a taster, we’ll produce
a trailer for a film or TV show from
a set of clips we’ve prepared. You’ll
get to call the shots, deciding what
goes where and how to make it look
perfect.
If editing is your chosen art, then
we’ll give you dedicated training on
the use of our suites so you know
how to do all the basics. All you
need is creativity and imagination.
Interested?
If all that sounds like fun, then come
along and get involved. We’ll be
running two workshops. The first
on Sunday October 8 and again on
Wednesday October 11, both from
2 to 5pm. And because we all know
that bribery works, there’ll be free
food, beer, soft drinks and whatever
else we can tempt you with.
