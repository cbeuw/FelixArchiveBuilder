Chinese Whispers again
R
ather than starting the
year and having Felix
talk about the activities
and indeed the wherea-
bouts of students during
fresher’s week, this year has start-
ed with very interesting news in the
form of Emily Chow and the Chi-
nese society, seen on the front page
of last week’s Felix, after solicitors
acting on her behalf threatened the
Union’s President, ex-President,
and two sabbaticals with legal ac-
tion unless they reverse the deci-
sion to suspend the Chinese society
from any and all activity including
the Freshers’ Fair.
The Union informed the society
that they would not have a stall at
Freshers’ Fair or be allowed to run
their society until several monetary
issues are cleared up, including
charging £10 for multi-year mem-
berships when it’s illegal to do so,
taking money from freshers at
Freshers’ Fair last year which is
also illegal (whoops), and very in-
terestingly organizing an event in
Hong Kong which cost £13 to attend,
without the Union’s knowledge or
consent (double whoops). Most im-
portantly, a lot of this money, includ-
ing the money from the Hong Kong
event and the extra money from
the multi-year memberships, has
never been banked into the ICCS
account – thrice whoops.
So, because of all this, and I
promise not to mention the almost
£2000 debt as an additional reason,
John Sargent applies some good old-fashioned common sense to the laughable
prospect of Union Officers being sued by one of their constituent clubs.
the Union contacted the president
and treasurer in August. What last
week’s article didn’t mention, how-
ever, was that the first contact the
Chinese Society had with the Union
President John Collins regarding
the matter was the letter from a
law firm in Hong Kong threatening
a lawsuit over the suspension of the
society; I thought this was slightly
impolite to say the least.
It is very likely that I’ve missed
about thirty steps worth of bureau-
cratic councils, committees, tri-
bunals, assemblies, directorates,
conventions, panels, and governing
bodies before the situation gets ex-
treme enough to take the issue to
court – clearly Miss Chow had oth-
er ideas, but this author thinks that
she probably should have thought
this one over a bit more carefully
before she brought in the suits.
I could refer to the Union consti-
tution, the charter, and all sorts of
rules governing clubs and societies,
but it boils down to this: the DPFS
can freeze the budget of a society if
there are monetary problems, such
as, let’s say, taking money from
people associated with your society
and not banking it into the society’s
bank account, otherwise known as
fraud. The DPCS can suspend a
society for incomplete documen-
tation. And since the President is
responsible for all Union activities,
he can do all of the above and more.
This action was taken against the
society, and not against any one
F
or the majority of their
lives, human beings usu-
ally try to avoid unneces-
sary suffering. Perhaps
this is slightly different at
Imperial, where the proportion of
those with a masochistic tendency
is higher, but I would hope that this
basic part of human character still
stands within us. Let’s just hope it
does, it’s not like the first week of
term isn’t hard enough! So why,
then, is there a great proportion
of campus that is deciding to go
deliberately against the grain and
search for pain?
OK, so maybe it’s your first day,
first year or perhaps coming back
after a long summer where you
missed out on that addictive uni at-
mosphere. You come (back) to your
friends, get ‘chillaxing’ and let the
good times roll. That is what life’s
about. Each and every action per-
formed by you this week will prob-
ably be aimed at acquiring some
sort of benefit, be it material or
not, like making a friend or new ac-
quaintance soon to become a “net-
work” contact. In fact, if you were
to perform an action that resulted
in no gain, yet lost time and energy,
then you would probably class your-
self as a grade A idiot. Right? Now
– let’s think. What actions are there
from which you can receive no gain,
none whatsoever, yet still consist-
ently undertake the very same
action?
For every act there is most cer-
tainly, most definitely, a desired re-
ward no matter who undertakes it.
The difficulty arises when trying to
asses the nature of that reward. Dif-
ferent people from differing views,
for instance atheists, Jews or Sikhs,
all may agree on the same action
being ‘good’; charity for instance.
Charity has no overt reward. You
don’t really even know that your
money will reach the needy due
to the thousand obstacles in the
way. Yet, you give that coin or note
nonetheless because you feel some
sort of gain – perhaps the world will
benefit from it (or if you’re really
clever, to impress someone and get
a bonus, or a raise, brownie point
or some other deviant material re-
ward). But sometimes we act in a
way that defies temporal logic. Per-
haps there is something in human
nature that pushes each individual
to strive for more than one’s land,
flock or pride. But this lifelong push
towards being more than what
one already is rests on two factors
that seem to be infinitely variable
between different individuals; cer-
tainty and purpose. I may perform
an action that has no reward, not
in this world at least, yet I have a
certainty that there is a much more
intangible reward and satisfaction.
It is not done simply for a material
reward or for the hope of a better
living.
So today is the 9th day of fasting
in Ramadan. Just to refresh – that’s
no food, nor water between sunrise
(about 5am) and sunset (around
6.30pm). Furthermore, lying, cheat-
ing, backbiting etc, are actively dis-
couraged by individuals who are
fasting, while supplications and
meditation over one’s purpose in
life increase. There is no fear about
loss or hunger. If you consider to-
day’s political climate, there isn’t
any concern about the attitudes or
possible actions of other people.
And there is no material reward,
except the certainty that God will
be happy with you, and that makes
you quite happy. It is your view
about what happens after life that
changes how you acts in this one. To
many, this is a dangerous mind-set,
liable to corruption and the worst
forms of extremism. But, to others
it represents a liberation from one’s
own weaknesses and fears, and be-
comes the centre of life’s purpose
itself, and a satisfaction with what
will come after.
For those who enjoy their suffering...
individual such as the president
or treasurer, so here’s my honest
question: where the hell does the
lawsuit come into play?
I should also point out, for eve-
ryone’s benefit, that if you infer
or claim that you have no internet
access, it is wise not to go posting
publicly on Facebook.
Let’s look at it from another per-
spective. This year, I am a commit-
tee member of the CGCU Motor
Club, and we can’t get our funds re-
leased because we have yet to elect
a president and treasurer (whoops).
Because this isn’t directly my fault,
perhaps I should sue the union of-
ficers so I can get this year’s budget
released. There are two problems,
though – since clubs and societies
are not actually legal entities, it
would mean it’s me suing rather
than the club suing. Additionally, by
suing officers of the union I’m not
just taking the Union to court as an
entity, but also involving Imperial
College. What chance would I have
facing the wrath of College, suing
for something I can’t sue for in the
first place?
So in conclusion, Miss Chow has
done nothing wrong, unless you
count the whoopsie on Facebook
and seeking legal action in the first
place – but neither has the Union.
Surely, then, everyone can start
working towards a solution instead
of being at each other’s throats
when it is certain that this conflict
will result in no gain for anyone.

Dear Editor,
In his opinion piece on joining
the NUS, Mr Guite argues his
case in favour of affiliation, but
he completely fails to consider
the other side of the issue.
Mr Guite talks about a free
ICIS card and discounts one
can get with the NUS card;
however, he fails to mention
that the NUS card itself is no
longer free but costs £10. No
NUS card, no discounts.
This is in addition to the sub-
stantial affiliation fee the Union
will have to pay. In the last
referendum on NUS affiliation
at Imperial in 2002, 72% voted
against affiliation. This large
majority is even more impres-
sive considering that at that
time the NUS card was free for
students.
We just did not want to affili-
ate to a body whose politics are
so far removed from ours. ICU
has always been an apolitical
organisation, focussing their ef-
forts on issues directly affecting
Imperial students as students
and not getting encumbered
with general politics. According
to the their website, the NUS
spends quite some time in front
of embassies, demonstrating
against wars etc, which is fine
in general but really not their
job, instead of concentrating on
student issues such as tuition
fees which they spectacularly
failed to prevent.
Things like this happen when
people are only interested in
climbing the political ladder
and see the NUS as a first step
to do so, as has been the situ-
ation for quite some time. Mr
Guite himself agrees that the
NUS needs reform. However, I
think that he is somewhat over-
optimistic when he says that
we would be at the forefront of
reforms if we joined. We would
be the new guys, with little
influence. We would be just one
voice, lost in the noise.
Now, let me assume for a
moment that the NUS did of-
fer the benefit of lobbying at
the highest political levels on
student issues, disregarding
for a moment the question of
whether it is effective at this or
not. Do we really need to spend
£50,000 for this to happen? The
NUS would campaign on the
most important issues anyway,
and we would reap the benefits
whether we are affiliated or not.
And for the rest we would not
have the power to push them
in a direction they did not want
to go. So why join and spend all
that money that could be put to
better use increasing the fund-
ing for our clubs and societies,
directly benefiting all students
at Imperial?
