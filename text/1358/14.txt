W
ell, we still
haven’t been
able to get rid
of Greg com-
pletely, so this
week’s Nightlife page comes to
you courtesy of both of us again.
Next week, Greg really will be
leaving us for a while, but never
fear, he will still be prodding me
from behind the scenes.
We hope all you new arrivals
have been having a wonder-
ful Fresher’s Week and haven’t
been too busy to check out some
of the clubs we recommended
last week, but if you have, rest
assured that for the rest of the
year we shall be reviewing and
recommending a plethora of
lovely clubs worth your attention
(or maybe telling you to avoid the
less worthy ones).
Our main feature this week
sees us reminiscing over the his-
tory of a favourite club of ours,
And Did We Mention Our Disco,
which may soon be in a new
permanent home much to our de-
light. With a friendly atmosphere
and great music, we hope that
some of you will be able to enjoy
it in its new guise in the not too
distant future.
In addition, we have a feature
for those of you condisering
throwing parties in your beauti-
ful new houses, with a few tips to
help party go off without a hitch.
If you didn’t enter our competi-
tions last week, you still have
until Friday next week to email in
and bag yourself some great priz-
es. Just email us saying which
competition you would like to
enter and we will select winners
randomly. Of course, it wouldn’t
hurt to make these emails a bit
more interesting, as Greg and I
do get bored sometimes.
Above all, don’t get too attached
to the union, since there are plen-
ty of other places out there, just
get some friends together and try
out some clubs. If you happen to
enjoy one of these outings, why
not write a review and email it in,
we may even print it.
On that note, if you are a bud-
ding journalist and enjoy going
out to clubs around London,
email us and we can get you free
entry and guestlist places into
clubs in exchange for the lovely
reviews you will write.
Well, that’s it for this week. We
hope you thoroughly enjoy read-
ing this page and have fun during
what remains of Fresher’s Week.
But not that illegal kind of fun.

Our Disco is back?
Our Disco set to move into a new venue, perhaps, maybe
With news that everyone’s favourite
alternative electro clubnight may
soon be finding a permanent new
home after several months in limbo,
we at Nightlife are rejoicing. After
being kicked out of Plastic People,
their regular home in Shoreditch,
Our Disco have been keeping their
name alive with a number of one-off
events around London.
Back in their heyday at Plastic
People, Our Disco attracted such
big-name DJ’s as Mylo, Erol Alkan
and 2 Many DJ’s, as well as live
bands. All this was on top of a sturdy
backbone of resident DJ’s (includ-
ing Rory Phillips of Trash-fame).
Although in a similar vein to
Trash, Our Disco did without the
‘fascist fashionista’ door-policy and
too-hip clientelle. Musically, there
tended to be a more electronic bent
to the tunes on offer, making for a
lower proportion of Indie Kids on
the dancefloor.
The final event at Plastic People
attracted so many people that by
midnight the queue snaked most of
the way down the street, much to
the dismay of anyone hoping to ac-
tually get in. We, however, did man-
age to negotiate our way in at a rea-
sonable hour and enjoyed a fitting
send-off for what had, for the past
three years, been a staple Friday
night outing.

Following a couple of events at
the overpriced and oversized Can-
vas in King’s Cross, things did not
look good for our beloved clubnight.
Despite attracting huge crowds,
Canvas has none of the cave-like
charm seen at Plastic People and
on top of this, the entry and drinks
prices soared well beyond what
Our Disco regulars were used to,
the promise of cheaper drinks for
the second Canvas event made for
a considerably better night, the fact
that it wasn’t free entry also dis-
suaded random people just looking
for a free night out from attending,
which is probably a good thing in
that part of the world.
The club’s stint at Canvas cli-
maxed with a night featuring the
best in recent French Electro acts
including Justice, Mr. Oizo and a
brief live performance from petite
Miami rapper Uffie. A packed ven-
More Competitions!
May’s Parisian Invasion event at Our Disco
ue, cheaper drinks and an excellent
line-up resulted in a great night for
all present, the dancefloor being
packed out for the entire night with-
out the annoyance of sweaty people
stuck to you. Since the events at
Canvas, the Our Disco crew have
been on the road this summer, ap-
pearing at a number of venues
around the country and are soon to
be jetting off to Barcelona.
Wherever the folks at Our Dis-
co do eventually decide to set up
camp, be it Canvas or anywhere
else (please be Plastic People!), we
have no doubt that they can further
raise the bar with some utterly awe-
some-a-licious parties.

Planning a
house party?
Don’t.

Many of you new second years mov-
ing into houses of your own for the
very first time may have had the
revolutionary idea of throwing a
housewarming party in your fancy
new abode (which is unlikely to be
so fancy the morning after). In our
experience, this is a horrifically
bad idea unless you know some
interesting and attractive people,
which is fairly unlikely (I don’t). If
you absolutely insist on hosting
one of these parties, you could do
worse than to pay heed to this brief
and poorly-constructed selection of
hints and tips.
Most people will tell you that the
most important part of hosting a
house party is inviting the right
people, but these people are wrong.
Invite everyone in your phone mem-
ory and all your e-mail contacts
and get your housemates to do the
same. Invite your next door neigh-
bours and their childen, hell, why
not just invite the whole street?
Right, now you have some peo-
ple to attend your party, we come
to the single most important ele-
ment: dips. One flavour of dip will
not usually be enough, although
there’s no need to expand your se-
lection beyond red and white, but
for heaven’s sake remember to pro-
vide enough crisps, which must be
sturdy enough for dipping.
Free booze will also help to keep
your house guests interested. Pro-
vide some beer for the gents and
some tasty punch for the ladies.
In conclusion, the only thing you
need to throw a great house party
is drugs, yes lots and lots and lots of
drugs. Get everyone coked or ketted
up and it’ll be a blast. I promise.
