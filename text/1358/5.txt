Physics is a Feminist Issue
As the gender balance in Science continues to tip towards men, we ask: where have all the little girls gone?
Pick a random member of the phys-
ics department at Imperial College.
Go on, any one will do. There may
be a lucious and free-flowing mane
covering the troubled individual,
but delve a bit deeper and I bet
you’ll find a Y somewhere in their
chromosomes. It is statistical likli-
hood that the baryon-informed be-
ing standing in front of you is not a
woman. It’s not sexist; it’s an un-
disputable fact. So, why do so few of
the fairer sex grace the corridors of
Blackett? Is the lack of ladies some-
thing we should worry about?
Variety is the spice of life and if we
are to believe the proverbial nurs-
ery rhyme (‘What are little girls
made of?’) then physics is missing
out on a lot of spice. In order to pre-
vent extinction of this endangered
species, a government initiative
labelled ‘A Strategy for Women in
Science, Engineering and Technol-
ogy’ was launched in April 2003 to
try to coax women into science. A
month later the Institute of Phys-
ics jumped on the bandwagon and
launched their own ‘Women in
Physics’ group whose efforts in-
cludes a ‘how to attract women’
guide for physics departments.
The Institute’s repertoire of hot
tips includes advice to mechanics
lecturers like: ‘Make sure that ex-
amples given reflect modern socie-
ty and are gender neutral. e.g. a bi-
cycle is neutral, a car – particularly
a racing car- is more male.,’ and
even lecture theatres themselves
must take note, ‘Do you have pho-
tographs of physicists on the walls?
– if so what fraction are women?’
Political correctness gone mad?
Certifiable, by the sounds of things.
Why men are lured by the seduc-
tive call of calculus and the major-
Emma Turner ity of fashion students are female
has long been the subject of debate,
and some suggest the root of it lies
in our childhoods. When selecting
toys scientists have observed that
little boys will gravitate towards
a ball or toy trucks whereas little
girls will tend to pick a doll. But is
the reason nature or nurture? Stud-
ies have shown that in general men
do slightly better in mathematical
problem solving and spatial rea-
soning than women suggesting an
in-built mental difference between
the sexes. This is not to say that
women cannot learn these skills
to the same ability, but it may take
them longer. Although there is in-
creasing evidence that this is due to
cognitive differences in the brain,
the jury is still out. But there is no
escaping the evidence that there is
a deficit of totty in the physics de-
partment. Physics requires those
‘male-favoured’ skills that the ma-
jority of women shy away from thus
female physicists are few are far
between.
So how would you ever recognise
such an elusive creature if by some
miracle you were to stumble across
one? She is often to be found in the
library or computer room, beaver-
ing away on her projects and prob-
lem sheets. A female physicist is
always working hard. She is more
likely to be surrounded by a gaggle
of men than to gather with her own
kind. For some unknown reason, fe-
male physicists spread out over the
male student body evenly like a thin
layer of oil on water. Finally some
studies over extensive periods of
time have shown that in some spec-
imens traditionally female traits
become reduced over years of male
exposure and in extreme cases are
lost altogether.
According to Bob Forsyth, Senior
Whistling a merry tune whilst walk-
ing gaily down the street on a crisp
autumn morning, do you find that
that the reaction is often children
running screaming in the opposite
direction rather than an apprecia-
tive smile from a fellow pedestrian?
If so, Krista Hyde and colleagues
at the Montreal Cognitive Neuro-
logical Institute may hold the key
to this most distressing condition.
You, like some 4% of the population,
may suffer from congenital amusia,
or what our friends at the Royal
College of Science refer to as ‘tone
deafness.’
Congenital amusia is a disorder
that results in sufferers being un-
able to either perceive or produce
music. These symptoms often man-
ifest themselves despite apparent
normal neurological history, edu-
cation, intelligence and memory. It
is a lifelong musical affliction. Be-
havioural studies have previously
associated amusia with a severe
deficit in pitch processing but until
recently there was no neurologi-
cal evidence to support this theory.
Hyde’s study is the first such in-
vestigation into neural correlates
of congenital amusia and appears
to have discovered the area of the
brain responsible for the disorder.
The investigation consisted of two
tests based firstly on the ability of
patients to detect if and when they
were singing out of tune, and sec-
ondly on musical memory. The dif-
fering brain anatomical responses
between the two groups of patients
to the tests were quantified using
weighted magnetic resonance im-
aging (MRI).
Comparison of images from the
two groups revealed the inferior
right frontal cortex to be responsi-
ble for pitch encoding and melodic
pitch memory and therefore ulti-
mately amuisa. In particular a de-
crease in the concentration of white
matter was observed in amusical
patients.
White matter is composed of
myelinated nerve cells and serves
to transmit information within
the brain and the spinal cord. The
changes in concentration of white
matter is thought to reflect a larger
reduction in the connectivity be-
tween the pitch processing centre
of the inferior right frontal cortex
and the auditory centre of the brain.
Ultimately this revealed the link
between the anatomy of the brain
and musical behavior that eluded
researchers.
However, far from having inher-
ited that toneless crooning from
your dad, this disorder could po-
tentially be the result of environ-
mental conditions. The integrity of
white matter in the frontal hemi-
sphere of the brain is thought to be
vitally important to normal musical
competence.
A possible lack of extensive expo-
sure to music it is suggested may
result in a reduced myelination rate
of the connecting nerve cells and
as a result the connectivity of the
two musical centres of the brain is
impaired. Hopefully, Krista Hyde’s
research will now go some way to
helping all those talent TV shows
hopefuls understand why their mu-
sical efforts are not appreciated by
the other 96% of the populace.
How do you solve a problem
like…congenital amusia?
Tutor for the physics department,
the highest percentage of girls the
physics department has ever seen
currently resides in the fourth year,
hitting the heady heights of 25%.
‘But unfortunately it’s been trick-
ling down to just under 20% since
then’ he says regretfully.
A1:4ratiomaynotseemlikemuch
but even this is a veritable battalion
of girls compared to earlier times.
Looking back in history the ratio
of female to male physicists expo-
nentially decreases. You’d be hard
pressed to find the female version
before the 20th century as they were
forbidden access to higher learning
and laboratories. In the 16th cen-
tury King James I rejected the idea
Dean Veall
of educating his daughter reason-
ing that, “To make women learned
and foxes tame has the same effect
- to make them more cunning.” It is
a relief that this theory is no longer
believed (by the majority at least)
or we would be lacking some vital
contributions to physics today. For
example, without women in physics
we would not have the nuclear shell
model. Maria-Goeppert-Mayer won
the Nobel Prize in 1963 for her dis-
covery of ‘magic numbers’ (certain
numbers of nucleons in an atom
that cause it to be extremely sta-
ble) and their explanation in terms
of the shell model.
Granted, the number of achieve-
ments by men far outweighs those
by women and from the evidence it
doesn’t look like the stats are going
to even out any time soon. However,
without any sign of gender bias it
doesn’t seem that there is anything
for the feminists to get testy about
in the Blackett lab. If a girl wants to
get with the physics program then
IC welcomes you with open arms.
As always in life you can lead a
horse to water but you can’t make
it do a physics degree. On a positive
note however, being in the gender
minority can have its advantages.
After all anything rare is generally
considered valuable. You don’t have
to be a spice girl to have girl power
in the physics department. Sisters
are doing it for themselves.
What? More Science? Well,
seeing as you asked so nicely…
Firstly, those fun loving math-
ematicians at the American
Association of Mathmaticians
are currently looking for contri-
butions to the 4th annual Math
Art Exhibition. For more infor-
mation visit http://www.ams.
org/amsmtgs/2098_intro.html.
The Gresham Society is hold-
ing a free lecture on London’s
Ecology at 1pm on October 9 in
Barnards Inn Hall.
If you are having trouble mak-
ing sense of the universe, then
Michael Frayn, novelist and
playwright, and Paul Davies,
cosmologist, are talking about
just that, also on October 9 at
IPPR, Southampton St, WC2.
And if that doesn’t seem to
help, you can always come
home to the Sir Alexander
Fleming building at 6pm on Oc-
tober 12 to hear Bernard Carr,
(Queen Mary, University of Lon-
don), Paul Davies, (Macquarie
University) and Rodney Holder,
(Faraday Institute) explain ‘Why
is the universe so uncannily fit
for life?’. Enjoy!
