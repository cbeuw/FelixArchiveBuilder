Summer break television
The good, the bad, the legend, the cavernous mouth pieces, the manic depressive, the podgy bloke havin’ a
laff and the ugly, as well as numerous other clichés.

I never thought I would slip into the
stereotypical habits of student tele-
vision viewing. I’ve nothing against
those of you who rush home to get
your fix of life on Ramsey Street
or family friendly detective
shows played out on balsa wood
sets starring old, white haired,
should-be-by-name porn stars.
I just never expected these
brain disengaging, and obvi-
ously I mean that in a relaxing
sense, programs could be so
compelling.
Waking up at 9:25 during the
week will never be the same
again for me thanks to The
Jeremy Kyle Show during
the holidays. Taking over from
Trisha ‘get-in-da-kitchen-an’-
get-me-some-chicken-and-rice-
and-peas’ Goddard, Kyle has
brought his straight down the
line approach to daytime chat
shows.
Various ogres sporting bigger
gaps between their teeth than
the yellow enamel ridden pegs
themselves bound onto the
stage spouting nothing audible,
literally, in order to meet pre-
watershed requirements. But
whereas you get a sense Jerry
Springer’s audience are actu-
ally the ones out for blood car-
rying 6 inches of serrated steel
on their belts, Kyle keeps a se-
rene atmosphere in place at all
times. Calming his audience by
requesting boos and jeers are
withheld, a bodyguard is rarely
summoned. Not that Jezza K,
as his homies should call him,
would ever need them. His com-
bination of brick-shithouse stat-
ure, chav hypnotism and “two
sides to every story” attitude
ensures smooth runnings.
It is this final point that makes
The Jeremy Kyle Show tower
above the competition. The
initial guest is not necessarily
the one who walks unchanged
or unscathed. Often having
despaired that they’ve been
wrongly done in their life, the
accused guest enters stage left
and Kyle deftly probes his way to
the bottom of each story giving his
measured advice that the ‘victim’
scowls at. Prejudice is thrown out of
the window, then down the nearest
cliff and into the cave at the bottom
on The Jeremy Kyle Show. There is
a real sense
that the
riff raff out
there aren’t
all bad and
can change
their ways.
This is
certainly
a positive
point.
Unfortu-
nately, my
taste for
all things
student didn’t completely change
overnight. The success of Deal
Or No Deal remains a mystery to
me. I have never witnessed such
a self-congratulatory, patronising
and downright daft premise for a
game show. Please, before you re-
move this page of the newspaper,
whilst particularly paying attention
to seeing how many tiny fragments
you can tear my emboldened name
into, hear me out.
I congratulate Noel Edmunds
for bursting back onto the televi-
sion scene. Hopefully, this is just a
platform for higher prospects, but
I severely doubt Deal is a short-
term affair. My main qualm with
the program is the audience’s need
to clap every bloody time anything
at all happens. The contestant asks
Edmunds for ‘The Question’ in the
final part of
the round.
Inevitably,
the smug
git in the
high chair
replies:
“No deal!”
to which
the audi-
ence claps,
cheers
and even
‘woops’.
This is not
an American game show! Why do
they shout like they’re at an NFL
match where there is a vast open
stadium for their cola induced
wooping to gush out of?
Taking a step back, why does this
insistence on requesting The Ques-
tion even exist? Is the contestant
so stupid, he/she has forgotten the
rules? So stupid, he/she has forgot-
ten that Edmunds has previously
spoken to the banker who has of-
fered a wodge of cash? No, just like
the endless rapturous applause,
this is just a device to stretch out
the proceedings before the in-
evitable conclusion is reached,
for this is a game show where
the prize has already been de-
cided before a cameras have
begun to roll!
Deal Or No Deal is a mo-
notonous game of probability
disguised by the black phone
that has reset the cement on
Edmunds career. Rarely do the
contestants accept the banker’s
offers more out of fear of being
infinitely booed rather than out
of sensibility and therefore the
game is over before it’s even
commenced.
One man that can present a
game show is Stephen Fry. QI
is a quiet triumph nestling in
just beyond the primetime slots
of BBC2. Whilst QI provided
plenty of summer evening’s
entertainment, Fry’s two-part
documentary The Secret Life
Of The Manic Depressive was
easily the best viewing during
the holiday. Fry suffers from bi-
polar disorder along with 4 mil-
lion other people in the UK. In
the documentary Fry discussed
his condition with incredibly
personal insight, as well as vis-
iting friends and folk who cast
light on the subject.
The program blew away the
naïve clouds covering my eyes
and probably many others
throughout the UK. I fell into
the category of people imme-
diately addressed by Fry as be-
lieving manic depression was a
simplified way of saying you’re
just really, really low. Here lied
the programs biggest success.
In similar fashion to Pete win-
ning Big Brother and success-
fully drumming up awareness
for toilettes, The Secret Life has
Stephen Fry largely to thank for
its success because of his will-
ingness to open up so much of
his life, which could not have
been easy.
Not since last terms Tony Robin-
son: Me And My Mum, have audi-
ences had the chance to relate and
empathise with well known faces so
closely. Having been expelled from
school and imprisoned largely due
to his extremes of mood, Fry came
through all of this to get to where
he is today. Even more surprisingly
he thanks his manic depression for
this success. The program is due
to be repeated in the near future
according to the BBC website and
I urge you to watch if you missed
out.
Moving from one intellectual
extreme to the other, we arrive at
Loose Women. Riding high on the
recent wave of independent women
attitude largely thanks to Sex And
The City and possibly a certain song
by Destiny’s Child, a group of forty-
somethings sit around a table run-
ning their mouths about all sorts of
topical views. The conversation is
about as intellectually stimulating
as talking to a bottle of botox and
is comprised of whatever bullshit
has been written in Heat or Hello
or Closer or Cosmopolitan during
the week. So, the content doesn’t
exactly match up to Question Time,
but one thing the women do have in
common with the politicians on that
program is that the waffle spewing
from their mouths is unbelievably
hard to comprehend.
‘Feminism’ is the first word that
springs to mind when viewing the
program, but even this isn’t accu-
rate as the opinions are tinged by
a sense of misandry that lies within
some of the loose women. Occa-
sionally a special guest of the lesser
sex is brought out and at this point
we may expect a tip in the balance
of the man hating fuelled conversa-
tion, but this adds fuel to the fire as
the women out do each other and si-
lence the poor bloke with their end-
less talking. I’ve already spent too
long on this and I feel I’m treading
into dangerous territory but televi-
sion would be a better place without
a live version of OK magazine.
From one program to next via
a tenuous link, we arrive at a pro-
gram not afraid to offend for the
sake of comedy with Extras. Andy
and Maggie make a welcome return
but this time the tubby wannabe
actor has got his own show com-
missioned, whilst the dapsy blonde
continues to basically dig holes for
her best friend to fall into.
The hook for the first series was
the chance to see famous stars
parodying themselves but this has
taken a back seat as Ricky Gervais
Loose Women: Giant axe wounds.
Deal Or No Deal: Noel Edmunds spots an
audience member with no hands or voice.
The Secret Life Of The Manic Depressive: Stephen was feeling
particularly pleased with himself after successfully leaving his red
boxer shorts in a white wash.
lets the story of come to the fore.
Andy is rising through televisions
ranks where reality is not all rosy.
Major changes to his script are
made by those ‘in the know’ and
somehow the hollow gap between
his agent’s ears has become even
more vacuous.
Until the third episode with an hi-
lariously ‘macho’ Daniel Radcliffe
and a dwarf known to me as none
other than ‘Him from Willow’, Ex-
tras suffered slightly from Gervais’
slightly heavy handed attempts at
telling us how much of a struggle
the television industry is. Still, Ger-
vais continues to produce comedy
that is a cut above the competition
and each episode is over faster than
Stephen Merchant can unsuccess-
fully chat up a pair of women.
The Charlotte Church Show
deserves no tenuous link however.
I’m going to put as much effort into
this summary as it takes to give a
chavette her own television chat
show. The show begins with some
stat about Cardiff’s crime rate and
depicts brawling Welshmen, which
is not something I’d be promot-
ing if I was constantly pushing the
fact I’m obsessed with the coun-
try I originate from. Why the fuck
doesn’t she shut up about Wales?
Borat talks about Kazaksthan less
than she does Wales and he is liter-
ally a joke! We get it Church! You
are the offspring of beastiality! Now
kindly watch the door on the way
out in case it hits your hind legs.
