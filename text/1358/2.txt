Tone deafness
“Whistling a merry tune whilst
walking gaily down the street on
a crisp autumn morning, do you
find that that the reaction is often
children running screaming in the
opposite direction rather than an
appreciative smile from a fellow
pedestrian? Congenital amusia is
a disorder that results in sufferers
being unable to either perceive or
produce music.”

Chinese whispers
“Rather than starting the year
and having Felix talk about
the activities and indeed the
whereabouts of students during
fresher’s week, this year has
started with very interesting news
in the form of Emily Chow and the
Chinese society.”

Bad vs good
“In this music section we like to be
controversial so we gave a good
review to a new Warp electronic
album and a bad review to The
Young Knives album. It would
be good to get feedback from
other people who have heard
these albums so that we can get a
discussion going.”

In a rather furious statement to
Felix, John Kenchington, the Lon-
don Student editor, said: “ROAR
should be seen as a shining ex-
ample of what not to do to student
journalism. We want to make sure
that London Student does not go
the same way as ROAR; our edito-
rial independence should be seen
as paramount.” Commenting on
the somewhat odd behaviour of
the removal of clauses from the
presentation by Vicki Slater, Mr.
Kenchington said: “It is nothing
short of scandalous that Slater told
us she didn’t know why she made
the changes”, adding that this re-
moval from a document tailored by
Ms. Slater for ULU management
“does not bode well”.
Felix also caught up with Chief
Subeditor of London Student, Jer-
emy Harris, at Freshers’ Fair. Mr.
Harris said that financial inde-
pendence seemed to no longer be
on the table with regards to Lon-
don Student’s future, and was very
pessimistic at the chance of it not
being closed in December, when
ULU Council will meet to discuss
the proposals: “they want to close
us down!” Speaking about the pos-
sible independent role of the news-
paper, he commented “you just try
running a student newspaper with-
out collegiate support”.
He also discussed the possible
removal of the paid sabbatical edi-
tor position, saying that it would
be “disaster for the newspaper”,
and adding that he and three other
members of the unpaid volunteer
staff had spent the entire summer
vacation getting London Student
ready for publication, expressing
regret that Felix and London Stu-
dent are the only two London stu-
dent newspapers with independent
sabbatical editors. Mr. Kenching-
ton’s statement to Felix also com-
mented on the possible removal of
the sabbatical position, saying that
it would “paralyse the newspaper,
which needs twenty-four hour
management”.
ULU’s serious financial prob-
lems are now widely known, as
reported in London Student and
Chinese Soc goes on
After last week’s cover story on the
suspension of Chinese Soc there
have been a mixed bag of updates
on the matter. The society have had
their accounts frozen because they
sold multi-year membership which
is illegal, and as yet, the missing
money from the memberships has
not been recovered. The accounts
of the society are still suspended,
this means they cannot trade or or-
ganise any events that will require
money being transferred to or from
their account. We reported that they
would not have a stall at Freshers’
Fair. This was overturned by the
Union and they had a stall, though
it was however closely monitored in
case they sold membership. The so-
ciety’s stall was also monitored for
the selling of membership via wire-
less internet connections, as were
other stalls at the Freshers’ Fair.
Emily Chow did not contact Fe-
lix directly but got her solicitors,
Rochman Landau, to send a short
email to say that they she was not
prepared to make a comment. This
email was not read until after Felix
was sent an e-mail on September
29 from the same solicitors to con-
firm that the Chinese Society would
have a stall at the Freshers’ Fair.
This was a day after the last issue’s
print date. The reason for the first
email not being read is because it
was seen as junk mail, as it had a
file attachment that appeared to be
similar to a virus attachment.
The matter of the money for mul-
ti-membership being missing has
not yet been resolved. At the time
Felix went to press, the solicitors
for Emily Chow have not met with
the Deputy Presidents for Clubs &
Societies and Finance & Services
to discuss any action to be taken.
The society’s accounts are likely to
remain suspended until the matter
is resolved.
It appears, from the solicitors’ let-
ters, that Miss Chow has entirely
dropped any threat of legal action
against the Union or the individual
sabbaticals involved in the disci-
plinary proceedings against ICCS.
The letters refer to reaching an
amicable agreement with the Un-
ion. Felix hopes this farcical situa-
tion will be resolved soon.

Threat to London’s free
student press by unions
Continued from page 1 other newspapers. At the moment,
the newspaper receives almost
£30,000 from ULU, which is just 3%
of the Union’s £1m available grant.
Mr. Kenchington questioned the
logic of the cutting of this expense,
saying: “It is astonishing that that
it [the cost] is being targeted so
strongly”.
Felix costs the Union about
£7,000, not including the sabbatical
editor’s salary, which brings the
cost up to around £28,000. Howev-
er, it made nearly £50,000 last year
in advertising, with print costs be-
ing around this amount. Because
of the highly targeted nature of the
newspaper’s readership, Felix is
able to charge substantial sums for
advertising to corporate entities.
London Student, with a far larger
distribution and readership, is
likely to be able to command even
greater fees than this.
In comparison with ROAR, the
Union has received far more com-
plaints from the College authori-
ties about Felix in the previous
year, though no threats have been
made by the Sabbs to close the pa-
per down, or neuter it in a similar
way to the KCLSU newspaper.
The idea of having a “Media &
Communications” Deputy Presi-
dent, responsible for Felix’s over-
all content, but not its day-to-day
production, has been mooted nu-
merous times, and was allegedly
discussed in the sabbatical team
last year. This setup operates in a
number of other universities; most
notably at LSE’s Beaver. However,
in place of a dedicated sabbati-
cal editor, there is a large team of
editors, graphics assistants, and
designers. The freedom that such
systems allow varies from year
to year according the personality
of the overseeing sabbatical and
their closeness to the President
and other officers. Felix, on the
other hand, has its independence
guaranteed by the Union constitu-
tion, making the editor responsible
only to Union Council for the con-
tent of the newspaper.
It remains to be seen what this
year’s sabbatical team will make
of Felix’s slightly odd status in the
Union’s structure.
NUS protest stunt at Fair
A number of students took part in an NUS stunt at Freshers’ Fair; the gagging is supposed to
represent the fact that, with the Union leaving ULU, the students will have no voice unless they
gain national representation through the NUS. A petition at the Fair calling for an NUS referendum
received 675 signatures, above the required 575 (5% of the student body) needed for a referendum.
