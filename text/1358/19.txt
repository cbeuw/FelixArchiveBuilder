Greetings, crossword fans, and
other less important people!
Now that you’ve experienced
the joys of freshers’ week, I know
you’ll have lots of time to avoid
lectures and do my crossword
instead. I realise you might be
feeling a little fragile after all that
drinking, so I’ve made it quite easy
for the most part.
This week’s puzzle has a bit of a
geometric theme running through
it (and I don’t just mean the grid
design - although isn’t it pretty? I
made it myself, you know).
For extra bonus points, see if you
can work out which clues I wrote
while 9 down. Have fun! Rawden
Send your answers to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk or bring this
page down to the Felix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad. Each
week, we’ll choose a winner and print their name, thus providing
them with almost unlimited kudos and self-satisfaction. Everyone
who provides us with a correct solution will get an entry into our
prize draw at the end of the year.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
A sixties starlet
will rise from her
grave this week, and
progress towards
your humble student
digs. Enthralled by
her grave-rotted beauty, you’ll offer
to do her bidding. Six counts of
animal mistreatment later, you’ll
awake from your trance.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I
hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I
hate you. I hate you. I hate you.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
This week, a rein-
carnation of Ronald
Reagan will visit you
while you’re in bed.
Unfortunately for you,
you’ll be in bed with
your significant other at time. Coi-
tus interruptus or what? Reagan
will explain how only you can save
Reagonomics. Laugh.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Freshers’ Fair fills
you with a sense of
dread. Every year, at
this time, you sprout
weird, curly hair in
tufts on your neck. In
order to avoid the stares of fright-
ened and lonely freshers, you take
to wearing scarves. Later, a dog
bites your eyebrows.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (Jan 20 – Feb 18)
Crosswords are evil.
In fact, by looking at
the one below, you’ve
condemned your-
self to a afterlife of
blood-soaked, skinless
nightmares, rather like a Tesco’s
meat aisle, except with less grand-
mothers and rather more angry
demons with seventeen arms.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Beards don’t scare
you. Only the ghosts
of beards do. Every
time you see a recent-
ly shaved man, you’ll
begin to weep. The
beard ghosts don’t rest; instead,
they whine in your ears with voices
like Gilette Fusion razors over soft,
supple skin about death.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
There’s no escape
from paranoid psy-
chotics this week.
They all want to talk to
you about their prob-
lems; they say you’re
the only one that can understand
them. You’ll end up spending a for-
tune on self-help books for them,
and get a giant stress ulcer.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
I’ve been watching
you. I know where you
live. In fact, I know
where you went with
Ben on Tuesday night.
Unless you want your
current boyfriend to know, please
mail me a minimum of £50 to IC
Blackmailers Anonymous, c/o the
Felix Office, Beit Quad.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
You can’t stand people
who say the word
“ledgers” this week.
When you hear it,
blind fury will grip
your soul and force
you to cram your pint glass into
their mouth. Unfortunately for you,
you’re an accountant. Don’t drop
the soap in the prison showers.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
If you’re actually
enjoying these horo-
scopes, then please let
me know. After all, I
sit here on a Tuesday
night (a day before
deadline), drink a pint, and listen
to hardcore just to dream these
up for you. Feedback is welcome,
morons.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Woof woof woof. Woof
woof woof-woof. Woof
woof snarl. Woof
woof woof, woof woof;
WOOF woof woof.
Woof snarl: snarl,
woof woof-woof-woof bark. Whine,
bark snuffle woof-woof. Snarl snarl
snarl, woof woof woof bark-bark
woof. Snarl.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
You’ll be struck with
ideas this week. In
fact, so many ideas
will flood your skull
that you’ll forget your
name, where you live,
your parent’s faces, your fuck bud-
dies private parts, and your very
first dog’s name (he was called
Leo, by the way).
