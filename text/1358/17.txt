A very early start on a miserable
Monday morning in late June sig-
nalled the start of the Fellwander-
ers Summer Tour in the Swiss
Alps. The Alpine Pass Route (APR)
makes a complete East to West
traverse of Switzerland, from Sar-
gans to Montreux, and it was our
aim to tackle a significant chunk of
this epic journey.
We awoke in Meiringen to a glori-
ous morning, and we were able to
truly appreciate our amazing sur-
roundings. After a gentle ‘introduc-
tory’ day’s walk we, spent the night
in Grindelwald,, pitching our tents
with views of the Eiger. The enter-
tainment for the night was provided
by trying to light our cooking stoves
using ethanol instead of the recom-
mended petrol, much to the amuse-
ment of eight hungry people.
After a restless nights sleep due
to heavy rain and thunderstorms,
we packed up and began our day’s
walk. The walk was described as
‘surprisingly steep’, which we were
soon able to verify. Nonetheless,
superb weather and scenic views
more than compensated for the
physical exertion needed on this
section. After more than 10 hours,
having passed the Eiger/Mönch/
Jungfrau triple, we were relieved
to pitch our tents and cook dinner,
with the stunning Staubbach water-
fall illuminated in the background.
Unfortunately, later on the follow-
ing day the weather deteriorated
and we had to change into our wet
weather gear before continuing our
ascent to our rest point for the day,
the Rotstockhütte. The remote hut,
at 2039m, is only accessible on foot.
After a not insignificant pass fol-
lowing the Rotstockhütte, we tack-
led the highest (at 2778m) and the
most demanding of all passes on the
APR. Descending, steeply at times,
above glaciers we dropped to our
nights rest, overlooking the amaz-
ing Oeschinensee. We were joined
by some Swiss fishermen who had
travelled up to the Oeschinensee for
a weekend of fishing, and seemed
amazed to find us there. They could
not understand what we were do-
ing there if we weren’t fishing!
They made us feel most welcome,
offering us their special homemade
‘firewater,’ which ensured a good
nights sleep.
After a rest day paddling in the
lake, we climbed to the Bunder-
chrinde pass – a magnificent gap
in a craggy ridge – and then down
to Adelboden. The following day to
Lenk was ‘relatively undemanding’.
After the usual procedure of pitch-
ing tents and cooking dinner, we
visited ‘Andy’s Pub’ in Lenk, which
was exactly as the name indicates.
With a relatively early start, and
the absence of a reception, we left
Lenk unable to pay for our night’s
stay. We had already accomplished
the highest sections of our journey,
but nonetheless, today required the
crossing of two passes. Truttlisberg
pass at 2038m was our first, with our
ascent livened by climbing steel lad-
ders beside a waterfall. After a brief
pause, we had to prepare ourselves
for our second pass of the day, the
Krinnen pass at 1659m. Upon our
approach to this wooded ridge, the
weather deteriorated, and flickers
of lightning and rumbles of thunder
were evident in our surroundings.
When the rain caught up with us,
it really made up for the glorious
weather that we had received so
far. Very heavy thunderstorms ac-
companied our descent to Gsteig,
where it was decided that in our
sodden state, we should seek al-
ternative accommodation. The one
open hotel in Gsteig, the very nice
looking Hotel Baren, took sympathy
on us, and Tim negotiated an effec-
tively half-price deal. A superb meal
in the adjacent restaurant didn’t
disappoint, despite Evelyne nearly
setting the place on fire before we’d
even eaten.
The next day, after a promising
start, the weather again turned
against us and we joined a herd of
cows in a shed for our lunch. In the
afternoon, we crossed the Col des
Anderets, and after a welcome hot
chocolate at Isenau, the brighten-
ing weather tempted us to carry
on a little further, to Col des Moss-
es. An amazing walk contouring
around the mountainside provided
spectacular views of mountain tops
poking out above the clouds, with
the Mont Blanc massif visible in
the far distance. On arrival at our
intended campsite, it became ap-
parent that it was not aimed at peo-
ple with tents. Too tired to carry on
any further, we found a quiet area
of the site and pitched our tent in
somebody’s garden, ensuring that
we would have an early start in
the morning in case the owners
arrived.
We awoke with great determina-
tion. Today we would tackle the last
significant chunk of our trek. We
had great expectations of an amaz-
ing view of Lake Geneva, with Mon-
treux remaining hidden behind a
final spur of hillside. However, after
several hours’ walk we were pre-
sented with a blanket of haze and
very poor visibility. After spending
a few minutes cursing our luck, we
were rewarded with clearing views
of Lake Geneva some 1200m below.
Our destination that evening proved
to be a perfect penultimate conclu-
sion to our journey - we reflected
on our journey, as we wined and
dined watching a delightful sunset
sat 800m above the Lake, with the
city street lights glowing in the dis-
tance, and the occasional sample of
the vibrant Montreux Jazz Festival
climbing to our ears.
Our final base in Vevey acted
more as an expensive baggage
storage facility than a cheap hostel.
We celebrated the final night of our
tour, enjoying drinks and dancing to
the live bands at the festival. After
two weeks trekking across Switzer-
land, accomplishing over 10,000m of
ascent, and over 180km of mountain
trails we travelled back to England.
Whilst hard work at times, we could
all reflect on the magical scenery
and the good times that we had all
had together. The memories of the
summer tour will remain in our
minds for a long time to come.

Imperial College String Ensemble
(ICSE) is now entering its second
riotously successful year as a soci-
ety. Last year we built on an already
impressive foundation, branch-
ing-out with staged performances
of Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas and
challenging repertoire such as
Tchaikovsky’s Souvenir de Flor-
ence and Grieg’s Holberg Suite. We
have also been working on our rep-
utation for wild-partying, posing a
serious threat to many established
college music groups with the sheer
volume of our social events – we’ve
even developed groupies! After
brilliantly successful tours in the
Summer and Christmas holidays of
IC String Ensemble
2005 we’re heading off to the Peak
District for more barn-dancing and
watersports. Plans for 2006/7 in-
clude a student concerto, collabo-
rating with Leosoc for Artsfest 2007
as well as regular concerts slots
at Holy Trinity, Brompton. As the
college’s only small ensemble for
string players we offer a different
experience to Symphony Orchestra
and Sinfonietta, both socially and in
terms of repertoire.
