The devil wears Prada?
Innocent Anne Hathaway’s encounter with the darker side of fashion...

The Devil Wears Prada is a screen
adaptation of Lauren Weisberger’s
novel with the same title. However,
what is it about the book that has
caught the eye of the masses? What
is the tipping point of the novel that
catapulted it into a novel with film
rights? It is undeniable that the
classic my-boss-is-a-monster lines
are rather funny. However, it is the
rumour that the story’s monster,
Miranda Priestly is loosely based
on Lauren Weisberger’s experi-
ence when working as an assist-
ant for Anna Wintour, US editor of
Vogue that sealed the deal.
This is the new generation of
chick-lit books: The kiss-and-tell-all
genre.
In this film, Anne Hathaway takes
the lead as Andrea Sachs, a fresh
graduate from Northwestern Uni-
versity. A serious, aspiring jour-
nalist with stereotypical prejudice
towards fashion, she winds up at
Miranda Priestly’s (Meryl Streep)
office without a clue to Miranda
Priestly’s position in the fashion
world. Despite her odd-ensemble,
she gets hired as Miranda Priest-
ly’s co-assistant. In the beginning,
she rebels against the general wave
of expensive clothes at Runway.
However, she soon crumbles to col-
league pressure when she realized
that she wanted to win Miranda
Priestly’s approval.
Why does Andy (Andrea) want
to stay in Runway, a magazine she
doesn’t care about? Quoted as ‘the
job millions of girls would kill for’,
the belief is that once Andy has fin-
ished one year as Miranda Priest-
ly’s assistant, Miranda will help her
to get into any magazine or news-
paper she wants.
Helping Andy along the way is a
multitude of interesting charac-
ters. A stylish gay man is as crucial
to the fashion world as clothes are.
In this movie, Nigel (Stanley Tucci)
is the man with the taste that even
Miranda agrees with. Mild-man-
nered and a complete gentleman,
he assists Andy in her fashion
choices with generous helpings
from Runway’s fashion wardrobe.
The costume designer for this film
is none other than Patricia Fields,
who is well known for her work with
Sex and the City. And I guess that
explains the extremely gorgeous
green Calvin Klein dress which I
am still hankering after.
Back to the movie, another inter-
esting addition would be Christian
Thompson (Simon Baker), a suc-
cessful writer. While he helped her
on an impossible task i.e. to obtain
Harry Potter books before they
were even published, they share
more than a favourable working re-
lationship. The constant flirtations
and Andy’s personal attraction for
his curly blonde hair and generous
build make him the most unwel-
come and yet the most welcome
threat to her domestic life with
Alex, her live-in boyfriend.
Adrien Griener plays her down-
to-earth boyfriend. A one-dimen-
sional character just like her two
friends, Doug and Lily, they were
all quite impressed with the side
gains of Andy’s career at Runway
at first. However, when it seems
that Andy was changing and losing
her personality just to win Miran-
da’s approval, the friendship and
her relationship with Alex slips into
a downward spiral.
The movie is definitely not a strict
abider of the book. However, it is a
very neatly-sealed movie that gives
it a simple and easy-to-follow sto-
ryline. Unlike the book, which gave
in detail Miranda’s various and pe- Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway starring in The Devil Wears Prada
culiar demands, the movie simply
used a shortened slide-show meth-
od to explain Miranda’s vicious-
ness. An aspect that I disagreed
with would be the fact that they
miss out how Miranda discarded
her Hermes scarves as if they were
tissue paper. Miranda’s wasteful
habits have to be highlighted if the
movie is to generate more revenue
for its controversial likeness to
Anna Wintour.
According to popular opinion,
Meryl Streep did a great job as
Miranda Priestly. In fact, the title
‘Devil wears Prada’ could not be
accurate as trivia tells us that 40%
of her shoes in the film were from
Prada. And of course, nobody could
miss the obvious scene in the begin-
ning when the camera zoomed in
on Miranda’s bag of choice for the
day. There are many opinions that
state that Meryl Streep gave her
character an unquestionable sense
of grace and style. Despite the fact
that I agree with their opinions, I
have to digress on this portrayal of
Miranda Priestly.
In the book, not much is known
about Miranda Priestly. While we
know she is unreasonable and dif-
ficult, her personal life remains an
undisclosed issue. In contrast, the
movie gives a perspective of Miran-
da Priestly as a hardened woman
in her career with a broken family.
The movie has softened Miranda
Priestly into a common stereotype
that might have helped with the
storyline. Unfortunately, I disagree
because stereotypes are for Disney
films.
While Anne Hathaway did a great
job as a girl who got lost in the evil
drift of fashion, I think she needs
another film that can rid her of her
Disney-princess qualities. Perhaps
it is a personal cynicism issue, but
I think the film had a more fairy
tale-like quality than a sleazy tell-
all film.
Thefilmreachesitspinnaclewhen
Andy realizes that her decision to
go to Paris as Emily’s replacement
has changed her into a corporate
honour-less person. Without giving
away the ending, I have to say that
this is another Disney aspect of the
film. While unreasonable demands
such as Miranda’s might not exist in
the real world, it is naïve to refuse a
job promotion because your friend
wanted the same promotion. Poetic
justice is for fairy tales and frankly,
the Devil wears Prada should not
be a fairytale.
Lastly, I always have a lot of ex-
pectations from films. I have read
the book two years ago and hence,
I have my own opinions of it. There-
fore, to be fair, the film is indeed en-
tertaining and it is quite a treat for
the eyes. When there is Paris, New
York, beautiful clothes and shoes
in the mix, it is a sure-win for eye
candy. Nevertheless, be forewarned
that it is a comfort-film as it is filled
with common stereotypes and an
easily-digested storyline.
Hathaway’s lawyers refused to sue Starbucks for taking four
attempts to make the perfect latte maple macchiato.
