Recent events have thrown the po-
sition of London’s student newspa-
pers into doubt, with some raising
doubts over whether there will still
be a free student press in the city.
Two student newspapers, including
Europe’s largest, London Student,
are facing threats from their unions
with regards to their freedom and
continued existence.
The student newspaper of Kings
College London, Roar, has had a
number of changes enacted upon
it over the summer by the previous
year’sexecutive,withwhattheRoar
team have referred to as “minimal
consultation”. Prior to the summer
vacation, Roar was printed every
three weeks during term time; the
new Roar team will only be produc-
ing four issues a year. The make-up
of staff has also been modified; the
editorial team no longer have their
own individual sections to edit. The
‘managing editors’, full-time stu-
dents who run the paper on a day-
to-day basis, no longer exist. It is
not clear how the paper will be run
in future without the work of these
experienced volunteers.
The removal of the editorial team
is reportedly the result of 64 stu-
dents signing up at Freshers’ Fair,
with none going on to contribute
to the paper, though no facts have
emerged related to how many of
the 64 simply chose not to write. In
comparison, Felix has in past years
had more than three hundred peo-
ple sign up to write for the paper,
and has often only added five or six
permanent volunteers to its edito-
rial team. The outgoing managing
editor, Lauren Thompson, in com-
ments made to London Student,
stated that “KCLSU are trying to
gag their student press”, and sug-
gested that the removal of the edi-
torial team was in fact linked to the
poor relationship between the sab-
batical officers and the newspaper’s
editors. There have also been alle-
gations that the Kings College man-
agement leant on the Union to re-
move the editorial team, after what
the management felt were factual
inaccuracies in several articles.
The changes were pushed
through by the previous holder of
the Vice President of Communica-
tions post, Sneha Solanki, and the
ex-President, Daryn McCombe,
along with several other unnamed
members of the Union’s execu-
tive, and announced suddenly to
the Roar staff in June. All but one
of the eight members of the Roar
editorial team have questioned the
rationale behind the changes, one
complaining that it would result in
“utter, utter chaos”.
Ed Drummond, the new VP Com-
munications, has accepted that
the changes may not have been
necessary, but that they prevented
Roar from becoming “stale”. Felix
contacted Mr Drummond with a
number of questions; a reply came
too late to make it into this issue.
However, on the KCLSU website,
Mr Drummond has posted in the
sabbatical’s blogging area, asking
people to make comments about
the future of Roar on a KCLSU
message board – to date, there
have been a total of 8 replies. One
comment read: “Maybe the offic-
ers/staff/Roar editorial team could
figure out exactly what Roar is for,
and exactly what kind of students it
is aimed at. Maybe then the content
would become obvious.” Mr Mc-
Combe has refused to comment on
the changes or the reasons behind
them, leaving the staff to guess
what the purpose was.
London Student have also faced
the threat of closure, or at least
damage to their printing numbers
and frequency. ULU, London Stu-
dent’s publisher and part-funder,
has recently completed a huge Con-
sultation Project on ULU’s serv-
ices, involving officers from student
unions across the city. London Stu-
dent received a mixed response;
out of fifteen unions surveyed, only
five unions were positive about
the newspaper, whereas four were
fiercely critical of it. Imperial Col-
lege Union were one of the five that
rated London Student positively.
A presentation by one senior ULU
manager stated: “The situation
with London Student cannot con-
tinue in my view”, referring to the
fact that newspaper receives 5% of
ULU’s college grant at a time when
many other ULU services have
been disestablished. The options
offered in the presentation were
financial independence, becom-
ing “SU focussed”, or shut down
completely, with the money being
channelled into other ULU cam-
paigns and projects. The original
presentation stated that no dras-
tic changes would take place until
2008, with a period of consultation
with London Student contributors
before proposals were made to
ULU Council. These stipulations
were removed by Vicki Slater, the
new ULU President, in a later revi-
sion of the document.
Asked why she removed these
conditions, Ms. Slater responded
that there was no particular reason.
In a comment to London Student,
she said: “I don’t really know why I
took it out to be honest, I did it about
midnight”. She reassured the paper
that all parties involved will be con-
sulted prior to changes being made.

The closure of London Student would leave Felix as the only independent student newspaper in London
Freshers’ Fair Success
Freshers’ Fair this year was a success largely as a result of the
hard work of Eric Lai, Deputy President (Clubs & Societies).
