Enthusiastic
as ever
NOW IN I T S fourth year, Imperial C o l l e g e
C a n o e C l u b i s s t i l l functioning a s
enthusiastically as ever.
The club i s organised so that members
can become proficient at canoeing whilst
enjoying it i n any or a l l of i t s aspects:
from drifting quietly down a river admiring
the scenery and drinking cool cans of
F o s t e r s , to the more insane practice of
surfing at Bude under stormy conditions.
T h i s year many trips have been made to
fairly l o c a l sites (such as Shepperton and
O l d Winsor rivers) to gain practice. In
addition to t h e s e day or afternoon
excursions, several weekend trips to the
Upper Wye V a l l e y , the river U s k and Bude
seaside have been made. O n the latter
type of excursion ample opportunity
i s available for the leaving and furthering
of canoe techniques; river, s e a and pub
sessions are a l l w e l l organised and
integrated.
A s regards competitions, I C C C has
been w e l l represented at many events.
L a s t November we sent teams to the
Bedford-Ouse race and the famous E x e -
Descent (the toughest long distance
canoe race in Britain). At each the overall
standard of our entry was high. In the
Spring term our C l u b members formed the
hard-core of the University of L o n d o n team
sent up to Inverconnie (near Aberdeen) for
the British U n i v e r s i t i e s ' Canoe Slalom.
On the second day of this event we
entered many individual events, maintain-
ing high standards throughout — unfortunately
not high enough. It must be noted, however,
that conditions were far from i d e a l : C l u b
members had camped i n snow drifts for
two nights and even the drivers of the
R C C vans had c o l l a p s e d from fatigue!
At the beginning of this term the
club entered several teams i n the Newbury
Slalom, one of them managing to capture
second prize i n the Canadian double event.
A celebratory trip to the Gower i s
being made at the end of this term. T h e
other remaining event for this s e s s i o n i s
a surfing trip to South Brittany (at the end
of July).

La life a IF depuis GJp O f l / v ~ *
septembre"
Apres avoir done l e s " A " s j ' a i not know
what to d o , A l o r s j ' a i took l'advice d e s
profs, applied a l'lnstitut. Z e examen
d'entrance (quelle horreur) w a s un peu
difficile, J ' a i tried to do mon mieux of
course, but gave i n lots of s p i e l .
Neanmoins, j ' a i r e u s s i ' d , j ' a i started
in sepiembre, J ' a i heard beaucoup de
N U S et soon became a membre. O n nous a
warned zee work was dur avec beaucoup
de tests But eef we deed 1'essentiel then
never mind zee re st.
P a r " F r e s h e r s ' F a i r " nous got to
know a l l about I C — Socs et clubs et
weekly bops tous l e s vendredis. Mes
friends plus affluentes que moi took
part i n l a R a g Week; J e devais stay c h e z
moi et work, it made me really seek!
Tiddly-winking Oxford R u e semble'd
tres good fun, B u t entertainments with
IC 'ad only just begun. II y en a quelques
( T o be read with a French accent )
gars, d'accord, q u i sont comme c i comtne
c a , Certains sont tres beau et vraiment
certains ne sonl p a s .
(I ' a d to say zat a l l i n frrench, je ne
voudrais p a s offend C e u x q u i pouvaient
understand, whose egos may not mend).
Zee N o e l play w a s very drole, " L e
Chef de K o p e n i c k " , P u i s l e s Christmas
' o l i d a y s qui went p a s s e d far too quick!
E a s t e r term s a w most o f us encore
dans l e s s a l l e s A n d by now I found eet
plus f a c i l e to understand V i d a l . L a I F
B a l l w a s tres bien, eet 'appens once a
year C ' e s t dommage more people deedn't
come, per'aps eet was too dear.
L e time flew past, c'est deja mars,
elections came and went, Z e e E x e c
changed from o l d to new with me as
President. Apres P a q u e s l e s examens
were rearing ugly tetes (careful!) L e s
' A ' s et ' B ' s were looking c o o l , essayants
not to fret.
P a s much time left, beaucoup de
f i l l e s needed extra days J ' a i asked A R .
et he agreed for which nous give him
praise. L e s professeurs thought une telle
chose upset z e e status quo l i s thought
c'etait une dafte idee et duly told me s o .
But never mind, bye-bye Sorbonne,
j u s q u ' a next year at l e a s t , J ' a i saw y o u
a l l there dans z e e p u b , gaily getting
drunk!
Beaucoup de love,
