Questionaire on Flats and Bedsits.
At the beginning of the present academic year many students had great d i f f i c u l t y i n
obtaining accommodation i n f l a t s , houses and b e d s i t s . This was mainly because the
accommodation of t h i s type used by l a s t year's f i n a l year students had been l o s t to
students at the end of the summer term. Therefore to help people looking f o r
accommodation next September, I would l i k e to draw up a l i s t of student residences
being vacated at the end of t h i s s e s s i o n . I f you are t h i n k i n g of leaving College
t h i s year or are abandoning your accommodation over the summer v a c a t i o n f o r f i n a n c i a l
reasons please f i l l i n the accompanying questionnaire and e i t h e r r e t u r n i t to me at
the Union O f f i c e . (Use the i n t e r n a l mail.)
