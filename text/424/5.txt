M Y S P I E S tell me that a good time may
be h a d by taking a river boat down the
Thames to G r e e n w i c h . What with the
1776 E x h i b i t i o n , the Cutty Sark and the
Naval C o l l e g e , y o u may f i l l a whole
day with s i g h t s e e i n g . Whilst I cannot
vouch for this myself, I can tell y o u that
the Greenwich Theatre is w e l l worth a
v i s i t .
Next week they have extended their
run of two new p l a y s by John Mortimer,
starring Denholm E l l i o t t , Peter Woodthorpe
and Eleanor B r o n . F e a r of Heaven was
first broadcast on R a d i o 3 last February
and it i s because of that, that I didn't
enjoy it very much. Although an admirable
radio play its translation to the stage i s
l e s s s u c c e s s f u l for two reasons.
F i r s t l y , because the plot concerns
two E n g l i s h m e n who wake up, after
accidents, i n a Italian hospital with a
magnificent Cinguecents c e i l i n g and
believe themselves to be i n heaven, the
i l l u s i o n that they might p o s s i b l y imagine
this to be heaven is substantially reduced.
Whilst the radio version gave u s a
chance to picture in our minds a c e i l i n g
with so many angels, bearded prophets,
pulti and the foot of G o d (his b i g toe
As dry as old toast
over eighteen inches long), the reality
of the stage performance affords no
such i l l u s i o n s .
Secondly, the performance i s
necessarily static, with two men lying
in their hospital beds. Although Mr
E l l i o t t makes the o c c a s i o n a l foray across
the stage it i s only in order to give the
play a bit of action. I can only hope that
the B B C broadcast it again.
The second play is The Prince of
Darkness and concerns some extra-
ordinary goings-on i n a South London
vicarage. Whilst the incombent i s bury
organising get-togethers for raincoat
fanatics a n d granny knot fanciers, h i s
new corate, ex R A F padre A K Bulstrode,
is seducing h i s wife by performing
miracles. Peter Woodthorpe i s brilliant
as the middle-aged p h i m s o l - c l a d v i c a r ,
jiving to the works of Queen and of
Simon and Garfunkel.
B a c k i n the centre of L o n d o n , though
probably l e s s easy to reach than Green-
w i c h , which is fifteen minutes out of
Charing C r o s s on the Southern R e g i o n ,
the Open A i r Theatre Regents P a r k
has opened i t s new season with Othello.
T h i s is probably Shakespeare's most
single-minded p i e c e , with very little
relief from Iago's plot to reek havoc in
O t h e l l o ' s marriage. Without the a i d of
Nurse, Porter and Gravedigger this
play is a s dry a s o l d toast and the
production does very little to help.
Robert Stephens Othello takes h i s
lines at breakneck speed as if there were
some competition for the most words
spoken in a single breath. Towards the
end, though, he mellows and i n the final
murder scene is magnificient.
The trees of the park provide a
perfect backdrop for Mark N e g i n ' s versatile
green tower.. Natural distractions come
from the twittering of the birds and
showers of fluffy white seeds from the
trees; unnatural distractions are the
aircraft and the park keepers' loud-
speakers announcing the c l o s i n g of the
park. There i s excellent food at the bar
and mulled wine to warm you i n the
interval. T h e sign posting is l e s s than
satisfactory, the theatre entrance i s
through the R o s e Garden opposite Bedford
C o l l e g e . Don't bother to book in advance,
the night I went the auditorium was not
full, but arrive early to join the box-
office queue. T H O M A S S T E V E N S O N
Music
'Bellamy Brothers, Featuring
"Let Your Love Flow'" - Warner
Bros (56242)
A H A P P Y , jovial album -that's a s
frolicky as summer itself, but a n album
none the l e s s that w i l l get overlooked by
many record buyers. N o t that there's
anything substantially wrong with this
collection of songs from the West C o a s t
Bellamy Brothers; production, harmonies,
performances and l y r i c s are a l l well done.
Yet the album l a c k s that ' Je ne sais
quoi' that would take it from average to
good.
The L P features many songs in West-
C o a s t rythm of 'Let Your Love Flow';
pleasant numbers with short catchy, but
w e l l thought out, l y r i c s . One can't fault
the songs themselves except that they
are slightly insubstantial, i n that I find
it rather difficult to remember the numbers
when the record's f i n i s h e d .
I found the B e l l a m y ' s rather addicted
to this West-Coast rythm, a pity since
their creative ability shone through move
on the l e s s orthodox tracks. T r a c k s like
Best yet to come Cinema
Living In the West, a tale about western
gunfighters such as Frank and J e s s e
James, and Inside Of My Guitar let the
songwriting talents of D a v i d Bellamy
e x c e l and capture the Brothers interpretive
s k i l l s w e l l . These two differing songs are
rife with emotion and succeed much more
than the 'Standard'West-Coast rythm song.
Another fine song, i n truth the album's
best, i s Let Fantasy Live. T h e pensive
mood of this really caught me, a s d i d
the strong v o c a l treatment. T h e synthe-
sized v o c a l s at the e n d were particularly
ingeneous and fully i n keeping with the
explorative nature of the track.
In short, the B e l l a m y ' s have produced
an album that even at its most ordinary
is decidedly unperfunctory, yet fails to
shine throughout. A s a debut album for
Warners the L P i s a creditable effort
and won't disappoint too many. Y e t I
firmly believe that the best of the
B e l l a m y s ' is s t i l l to come. Their
creative a b i l i t y , particularly D a v i d ' s , i s
indisputable butt h a s s t i l l to manifest
itself in a tangible form. Their next
album should be really good!

" T H E L A S T H A R D M E N " ( F o x - R a n k )
directed by Andrew V M c L a g l e n ;
starring Charlton Heston and James
Coburn.
A C U R I O U S L Y unromantic and hard
hitting film, T H E L A S T H A R D M E N is
a story of vengeance. Sam Gurgade
(Charlton Heston) is the goodie; an
ex-lawman forced to take up h i s shooters
after having recently l a i d himself out
to grass.
At the end of h i s gunsight i s Provo
(James Coburn), a half.breed train
robber and k i l l e r whose only ambition
is to settle h i s score with Burgade.
Together with s i x other meanies, he
escapes from Yuma Territorial P r i s o n ,
a closer approximation to h e l l , one
could not really hope for.
Caught in the middle of this feud, in
which a l l the shots hit below the belt,
i s Burgade's daughter (Barbara Hershey),
her boyfriend (a very green looking
Christopher Mitchum) and a rule-book
sheriff (Michael P a r k s ) . T y p i c a l of the
sort of low tactics used, is the raping
of Burgade's daughter by two P r o v o ' s
cohoits in an attempt to lure Burgade
out.
A s far as i t s entertainment value
goes, i t ' s about average; certainly it,
does not rank with some of the films
currently o n show. The acting ranges
from mediocre to g o o d ; Coburn and
Hershey shining out above a tired
looking Heston. C h r i s Mitchum gives
an insipid showing on h i s first major
outing, but should improve a s he gains
more experience. If you are i n a mean
mood then avoid this one otherwise
give it a go if you have nothing better
