confidence.
Y o u w i l l be given a fairly
long form to f i l l i n . From the
details you supply, they w i l l
a s s e s s how much of your
rent goes towards rates,
water rates, heating, lighting,
furniture and s e r v i c e s . T h i s
they w i l l deduct from the
rent leaving a sum on which
rebate may be given. If this
sum i s , say, £5.00 per week
and your income is £25 per
week then as a single person
you could receive £2.04
