Cat let
out of
the bag
C O L L E G E O F F I C I A L S are
annoyed and puzzled that an
official report by S i r David
Huddie, on s o c i a l s c i e n c e
courses at I C , w a s leaked to
the T i m e s Higher Education
Supplement last week.
The report, which i s not
due to be d i s c u s s e d by the
Board of Studies until next
week, had at that point only
been circulated to Heads of
Departments. According to
T H E S the report i s said to
recommend that the teaching
of s o c i a l studies i n under-
graduate courses 'ought to be
significantly expanded'. In
particular it recommends the
inclusion of management
studies, industrial sociology
and economics i n a l l
undergraduate courses.
The proposals are no
doubt intended to give IC
graduates ' a broad under-
standing of society and a
grasp of managerial s k i l l s ' .
The T H E S article continues
" T h e report considers
what has been a vexed d i v i s i o n
within the college between
the sociologists in the
Industrial Sociology Unit and
the engineers and mixed
s o c i a l scientists of the
management s c i e n c e s
department. The point was
forcefully put to S i r D a v i d
that what w a s needed w a s a
unified s o c i a l science
department involving s o c i o l o -
g i s t s , e c o n o m i s t s and
psychologists, which would
be better equiped to make a
contribution across a whole
range of undergraduate
c o u r s e s " .

LSO withdrawal
imminent
IT WAS revealed last week
that IC Union has been a
member of the London
Students Organisation
(LSO) for the last 2 years
without a mandate from a
Union General Meeting.
A s a result of this the
Union has been paying a
£ 5 0 0 annual subscription
to L S O .
The news came last
Friday at the Joint Union
F i n a n c e Committee ( U F C ) ,
which decided to defer pay-
ment of the U n i o n ' s L S O
subscription until the matter
has been fully d i s c u s s e d
at a U G M .
The question of L S O
subscriptions h a s , however,
been briefly mentioned at
previous U F C and C o u n c i l
Meetings. A t last year's
Joint U F C , the impression
given by outgoing I C U
President Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
was that I C U was joining
the West London section of
L S O , which he thought
replaced the o l d U S K
Organisation (University of
South Kensington).
It seems likely that I C U ' s
membership of L S O w i l l be
d i s c u s s e d at the first U G M
of the Autumn term. L S O i s
now moving into its third
year with Mr P h i l l i p s as its
sabbatical secretary. Mr
P h i l l i p s has already been
invited to speak at the U G M .
However, it i s Mr P e t e r
Teague's considered opinion
that the meeting w i l l over-
whelmingly reject any moves
to continue a s members of
L S O .
According to I C Union
External Affairs Officer
and next y e a r ' s Deputy
President, Derrick " t h e
M o l e " Everett, I C had not
received any significant
benefit from being members
of L S O for the last two
years.

were to be decided a l s o
heard four other claims a l l
of them being ruled out of
order.
One of these w a s a £5
c l a i m from Dave C h a n c e ,
Welfare O f f i c e r - e l e c t . O n
Friday 4th June, a student
claiming to be a R h o d e s i a n ,
walked into the Union office
whose only occupant at the
time w a s B i l l Gerrard. T h e
student, sporting a wet
patch down the front of h i s
trousers, wanted to s e e the
Welfare Officer to borrow
some money.
H i s situation w a s this;
he had no money and h i s
artificial bladder h a d burst —
hence the wet patch. A r t i f i c i a l
bladders, he informed Mr •
Gerrard were £1 each and
came i n packs of five.
C o u l d he p o s s i b l y borrow £5?
He was to rendezvous with
his father outside the Science
Museum at 4.00pm that
afternoon. H e would return
the loan after c o l l e c t i n g
some money from h i m .
A l a s , Mr Gerrard d i d not
have £5 on h i s person, but
a l l w a s not lost. Mr C h a n c e
walked in just at that moment.
The situation was " e x p l a i n e d *
to him and did he have £5JYes.
A very relieved looking
student collared the £5
promising to return with it
later that afternoon — Mr
Chance i s s t i l l awaiting
his return.....
Mr C h a n c e ' s c l a i m w a s
denied and he w a s told to
put it down to experience.
However, this i s not a n
i s o l a t e d incident. Other
union officers in London
c o l l e g e s have recently
f a l l e n v i c t i m s to con-men of
various shades. Mr C h a n c e
did not however, take any
consolation from this piece
of news.
