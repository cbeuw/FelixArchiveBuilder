Editorial FELIX
Due to the impending presence of big bad exams, lack
of sleep, and the fact that there is absolutely nothing
to write about, there will be no editorial this week...
So the management would like to take this
opportunity to remind all people thinking of
contributing to the...
SUMMER SPECIAL
...that the provisional deadline for all submissions is
this evening!
Anything handed in after this time cannot be
guaranteed a place in the forthcoming literary
extravaganza, and thus it's author cannot be
guaranteed his/her/it's name in lights. Or at least in
print.
We would like to remind people that anything will be
considered, although only written or drawn
contributions will be printed...
