I .SO Taming of the Shrew
London Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Sir George Solti
Mozart Symphony no 35 'Haffner'
Mahler Symphony no 5 Barbican Hall,
May 9th
The LSO gave a fine interpretation of
the Haffner; crisply performed, accurate
and surefooted. In fact, the orchestra
galloped though it with such immense
ease and proficiency that it was clear this
was an easy warm up for the main piece
of the evening. Whilst it is understandable
that lesser orchestras would want to save
themselves for the more demanding
grandeur of Mahler's fifth, it is
disappointing that an orchestra of the
LSO's capabilities felt it had to give itself
such an easy ride.
Carping aside, on to the Mahler. This is
a performance that the audience in the
Barbican were priviliged to hear. From
the perfection of the opening trumpet
fanfare (Maurice Murphy) to the final
resounding chord, this was an
interpretation and execution to be
treasured.
Solti added new twists and to what is a
well-loved and, dare one say it, well worn
piece. The effect was achieved in several
ways: through fine ensemble playing and
first class performances by the soloists;
through unusual shifts of emphasis and
balance between sections of the orchestra
(a characteristic also heard in the Mozart,
where dominant brass crispened
traditionally soggy passages); and through
control of the acoustics so that both the
loudest and quietest passages filled the
hall without distortion.
The effect was particularly noticeable in
the Scherzo, normally a tiresome
experience for the audience, which
bubbled with irony and excitement. The
first movement was simply stunning:
frightening, moving and truly compelling.
The brilliance was temporarily mislaid in
the Adagettio in the final movement, but
recaptured in the rondo finale for a
stirring finish.

"The trouble with some women is
they get all worked up about
nothing and then they marry him."
Cher.
The play is advertised as being SEXIST!
"They have a right to work wherever
they want to - as long as they have
dinner ready when you get home."-
John Wayne. But it wasn't!
The play was performed at a tiny little
theatre above the Rose pub on the
Fulham Road. It's cheap, friendly and the
beer's good. The Rose Theatre Club was
founded by the american Robin
Brockman, who plays Petrucio (the
numero uno sexist). The Theatre Club
believes that Shakespeare was a nom de
plume of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of
Oxford. But no matter what your views
on the writer are the performance was
excellent and well worth the trip to the
pub.
The use of women as the servants
allowed an interesting relationship to
develope between themselves and their
"masters" which, when coupled with the
size of the auditorium, led to a very
intimate performance.
The play was described as " a comedy
on the art of training a wife". However
the impression given was that Katherina
(Caroline Lawrie) was actually using
Petrucio for her own gain, thus altering
the original sexist concept of the play.
The play is running until the 15th June
(excluding Mondays), start 7.30 pm and
costs £4 to students and a fiver to other
bods. It's a good play and we really liked
it, so get your arses down there, if only
for the beer.

Sibling Rivalry
Appreciation of this film will depend
on the audience's level of taste. If
its bad you'll like it. For example,
the height of humour in this film revolves
around the removal of the last used
condom from a long term stiff (no pun
intended)(honest guv).
The ale itself is of a sexually repressed
girl,-married to a boring man who has an
orgasmic fling with her husband's brother,
who (inevitably) croaks. Along with a
salesman who feels equally guilty for a
reason I can't remember, she desperately
tries to hide the body before her
husband's tight knit family discover. The
consequences, as the synopsis inevitably
tells us, are hilarious.
Nothing special is the best way I can
describe this film. It is a mediocre
comedy that won't excite anyone to
much, but will probably do quite well on
video. It also goes to prove that Kirstie
Alley should stay in Cheers, and that
Carrie Fisher's film career has been in a
steady spiral since Star Wars'. I'm glad
that she's having better luck with the
writing.
