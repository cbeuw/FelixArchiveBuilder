Now that most of you have finished your
exams, its about time you lost some of
the pounds that have been put on since
sitting on your backsides revising.
Acquacise is a new way of keeping fit,
which has just come to IC. This is
basically aerobics in a swimming pool
with the similar stretching and toning
exercises that are done in gymnasiums.
However, they claim that this is a much
more relaxing and refreshing way of
getting into shape than the stress
associated with jogging and aerobics.
Classes are held every Wednesdays at the
Imperial Sports Centre, with students
being charged £1 and everybody else £2.
Non swimmers are welcome as it is
completely safe as well as being lots of
fun, plus they are taught how to swim.
The centre also offers free nutritional
advice. So if you are interested, why not
pop along to one of their sessions, and
try to loose some of those excess pounds
in an easy and effective way.
IC Radio
The breakfast crew are here every
weekday morning from 8-10 with two
hours of the best music around, plus Ten
at Ten, The Stars and competitions. So
getup and get down on London's only
student radio station, IC Radio, on 999
kHz AM, and on speakers around the
campus.
And for those of you who haven't
bothered to hand in their top three all
time favourite singles (which means the
vast majotiy of inept IC students) you
have another chance this week. Simply
fill in the form below and hand it in to
either the FELIX office or directly to IC
radio. If this is too difficult a task, you
can also e-mail your selections to
khs@doc. A draw will be made (if enough
of u bother to fill out the forms below)
and the lucky person will be able to win
a CD/LP/tape of his/her choice from the
current charts.
