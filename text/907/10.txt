Scribbler's Corner
Dodgy Dealing in
Cheapskate Denied
Dear Andy,
In January the Union purchased a new
minibus and sold our oldest one. Despite
the old one being accepted in part
exchange for the new one. I would like
to make it clear that the two were in no
way related, despite minutes to the
contrary.
The purchase of the new van would
probably have gone ahead anyway, even
without the sale of the old one. Having
said this, we were extremely disappointed
that our mechanic gave us a duff quote
on the van. I thought £2 million was very
reasonable for a bashed old transit.
The Union Transport Manager thought
so aswell, at least he did before we
brought him in on his day off and sacked
him. It's funny, but his idea to upgrade
the transit to a caravan seemed like a
good idea.
In any case, everyone has forgotten
about it now. The first lot of passengers
have ridden in the new van, and now
that they've got used to it, we're going to
up the hire charge.
Finally, Andy, don't blame me for this
mess, I wasn't employed by the Union at
the time. The fact that I sat on the
Transport Committee that discussed this is
purely coincidental.
Yours sincerely,
Peter Milon.
