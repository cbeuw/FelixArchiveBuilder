misery on the SSEES defence as he
picked the ball up in midfield, spied
the keeper off his line and produced
an excellent lob from twenty yards
to put distance between the teams.
With ten minutes left in the half,
AD latched onto a long throw-in
near the SSEES corner flag by Matt
and produced a powerful low cross
which Jack was left to tap in easily
at the far post for 3-0. Even with all
the action going on at a frightening
pace there was still time for Pas, our
speedy striker, to round the keeper
and hit a shot at the lonely defender
who was standing on the line not
once, but twice when it was easier
just to roll the ball either side of him
Eastern Promise
Sevenths victory march continues
and add to the first half goal fest.
At half time changes were made
with Ian coming in to pair AD at cen-
tre back and Paul being shifted to
left back. Tuan, last year’s captain,
was brought on for Pas, who was still
wondering how he managed to miss
two of the easiest chances he’s prob-
ably ever had. However it is clear
that Pas has many a goal lurking
inside of him ready to be unleashed,
so future opponents beware!
The second half seemed to be
starting in much the same fashion
as the first with IC playing the better
football and controlling the game,
however a routine ball over the top
of the defence left AD in a race with

the SSEES striker. It looked an easy
win for the IC man who is normally
faster than a speeding bullet over
half a pitch until, in his eagerness to
win the contest, he pushed himself
just a little too far and his ankle
twisted, leaving the SSEES striker
to poke the ball over the onrushing
Ario, who had so far had an excel-
lent game in the IC goal. Soon after,
Tuan thought he’d try and score the
own-goal of the season by slicing the
ball from outside the penalty area
onto his own crossbar. He claims
it was a brilliant tactic to play the
ball out of danger but few believed
him and every time after when he
touched the ball the entire team
With the sun barely having set on
our majestic 5-2 friendly victory over
UCL 7s last week, IC 7’s went with
renewed vigour to Harlington for
our opening league match against
SSEES 1st’s. SSEES were relegated
last season, so it fell to us to remind
them just how harsh and unforgiving
football can be at this level. Team
captain Sam made some changes to
the team from the friendly victory to
ensure we started the season with
our strongest possible line-up. AD
was brought back into the defence
having previously scored in the 6’s
friendly loss to UCL 6’s last week,
a slightly strange feat given that he
had never previously scored at 7th
team level.
IC were playing at a level not seen
since last year. We were dominat-
ing central midfield and creating
chances while SSEES were reduced
to lofting balls over the top, which
the speedy centre backs AD and
Paul were dealing with easily. With
Sam and Sandy in central midfield
and two forceful wingers Jack and
Matt, pressure was applied in end-
less quantities on the SSEES goal
and after less than 10 minutes the
inevitable happened. Jarlath was
sent clear by a beautifully weighted
pass from Sam. He controlled the
ball and opened the scoring with a
powerful drive into the bottom cor-
ner leaving their keeper helpless.
Still our appetite for goal remained
undiminished and five minutes later
it was Jarlath again who heaped

held their breath in trepidation.
A captain’s goal by Sam was then
scored to put the result beyond
doubt when a loose ball from a cor-
ner was allowed to bounce around
in the box without being properly
cleared. It was then cannoned into
the goal on the volley, leaving the
SSEES keeper wondering where
his defence had gone. With 20 min-
utes to play, no subs and an injured
defender, Sam decided to put the
injured AD upfront, in what SSEES
must have thought to be a damage
limitation exercise. How wrong they
were! After a couple of runs were
rightly given offside against AD, he
decided to punish the opposition
by scoring a fantastic goal. Captain
Sam won the ball in the left of mid-
field, spied Matt on the wing and
passed to him in space. Matt then
saw the run into the box by AD and
crossed the ball just over the one
defender in the box. AD was then
left in a dangerous predicament.
The ball looked too low to head when
it came to him, and with an injured
right ankle he risked a lengthy lay-
off if he tried to volley it and injured
himself further. In a split second he
decided to launch himself at the ball
with a diving header. From the pen-
alty spot he connected beautifully
and somehow managed to lob the
keeper with a diving header from
the penalty spot to score his first
league goal for IC.
A brilliant start to the season
and an encouraging performance
against a competent side, there will
be tougher challenges ahead this
year, but with more performances
as polished as this and a few more
spectacular goals, the sky’s the limit
for IC 7’s this year.
