Every summer Imperial sends five
or so students across the Atlantic to
the University of Delaware on the
east coast of the United States, as
part of the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Program (UROP). I
was one of the fortunate few to have
this experience – a chance to have
a stab at some real-world scientific
research while having a lot of fun.
The University of Delaware is situ-
ated on a beautiful, green campus
a short drive away from New York
City, Philadelphia, Washington, DC
and the seaside. Even though the
exchange takes place over 8 to 9
weeks during the summer months,
there is never a lack of activity, and
trips are organised to all of the above
places. To complement this, campus
life is lively – there are hundreds of
American students still on campus,
carrying out similar research place-
ments, so there are always parties
to go to, and plenty of poker to play.
The campus surrounds Main
Street, the place to be when in
Newark, DE, and is home to a vari-
ety of bars and eateries. It’s also
a short drive away from the malls,
providing ample opportunity to rake
in the benefits of the ‘strength’ of the
US dollar.
During the first seven weeks, I
stayed on campus in student dorms
and got to meet a variety of strange
but extremely friendly people,
including my American roommate,
Alfred Gordon Smith III. Despite his
remarkably silly name, AGSIII did
have a beach house in New Jersey,
water-skis, and a family connected
to government, so there were a few
things to benefit from (in addition to
just meeting a nice person!).
Don’t forget that there is some
exciting project work to be done
as well. There is a wide variety of
projects available, with work varying
depending on your choice. You may
work closely with a research group
or have your own project. I chose
to do mine in a condensed mat-
ter physics group, playing around
with some helium theory. Whatever
placement you choose, there will
always be plenty of help and advice
available and a chance to carry out
some quality research.
Perhaps the best cultural expe-
rience was the two-week home-
stay, where I got room and board
with a local American family. The
worst was possibly the distinct lack
of my mate, Marmite; I strongly
advise that you take a jar with you.
Personal issues aside, the exchange
is an excellent opportunity for extra
travel, as the placement takes up
only the first two months of the sum-
mer, leaving you free to explore on
the cheap.
The experience is highly recom-
mended by each and every one of us
who went!

By the time you read this, we will
already have put a satellite into
orbit.
Today, 27 October, at 07:52:26
(BST), SSETI-Express has been
launched into orbit by a Cosmos
rocket from Plesetsk, Russia, in
the DMC-3 flight of Surrey Satellite
Technology.
SSETI-Express is a low Earth
orbit (LEO) spacecraft, which
weighs 62 kg and has the approxi-
mate shape and size of a washing
machine. It is the first satellite in
orbit, which has been designed,
built and tested entirely by univer-
sity students across Europe.
SSETI-Express is an educational
mission. Beyond its technological
developments, its most important
purpose belongs down on Earth:
the students behind it. It has
encouraged, motivated and trained
students across Europe in a real
aerospace project. How many of
you will have put a satellite in orbit
before you graduate?
Besides this, SSETI-Express
also has physical payloads and
objectives. It will deploy CubeSat
picosatellites developed by three
different universities (in Norway,
Canada and Japan), take pictures
of the Earth and test hardware and
technology that will be used in our
next satellites. It also involves the
radio amateur community in the
downlink of the data and, once its
nominal mission is over, it will act
as a transponder for them.
SSETI-Express is a rarity in the
space field, not only because it has
been entirely done by students.
It has had a record development
time of only 18 months from kick-
off to flight readiness review, which
probably makes it the fastest
spacecraft design and construc-
tion project ever, hence the name
“Express”. Its cost contributes to
its rarity: by using donated materi-
als, equipment and expertise (from
ESA, universities and industry),
the total hardware expenditure by
ESA’s Education Department has
been kept below 100,000 euros.
As with all space projects, ours
hasn’t followed an easy path to
launch. The first launch was
scheduled for 25 August. It suf-
fered a month delay due to minor
problems with the main passenger
of the flight. After a 3 day delay in
September, it was delayed again
for another month, only 5 days
before launch, due to compatibility
problems. Finally, the launch was
set for today, and all looks good as
I’m writing this, D-day minus 5. If
the weather turns out to be hor-
rible, the launch will be postponed
until tomorrow. But a good thing
about launching with Russia is that
their rockets are tougher, and the
weather has to be truly horrible to
postpone the launch for one day.
The launch of SSETI-Express
has only been our first milestone.
Our second project, the European
Student Earth Orbiter (ESEO)
is currently in its design phase.
The Imperial College team is an
active member, being in charge
of the Assembly, Integration and
Verification (AIV) of the satellite.
Our third project, the European
Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO) is
undergoing feasibility studies now,
and we have thoughts of a fourth
mission, a Moon Rover.
We hope the launch today will
give our project a boost in terms of
not only students interested in the
project, but also opinions on our
work. The scientific community
and the public have been watch-
ing us for some time now and are
not yet sure how we manage to do
it. We astonish space profession-
als by continuing a project with
no funding to speak of, no recog-
nized expertise and almost never
meeting the other members face
to face. Indeed, we do this and a
degree at the same time, while
the professionals keep up with us
because it’s their full time job.
If you are lucky enough to
have picked this issue today in
the morning (or, even better,
Wednesday night as you leave
the Union), you are still in time
to come see our launch! The live
transmission starts at 7.30am in
the Blackett Laboratory, Level 8
Common Room, and there will be
repeats of the launch at 10.00am
and 12.00am in the Union building
(Beit Quad), Seminar Room 1.
