A star is born!
Eoin O Colgain
Wednesday 19th October brought
us back to Parliament Hill; a sweep-
ing panorama of London, shower
dodging in changeable weather,
fond nostalgia for a seasoned few,
especially the soon to be anointed
Dr. Daisley, and wide-eyed looks
from the intrepid but nameless
Freshmen. It was the first race of
the London Colleges’ League series:
a team event spun out over 6 events
with several colleges battling it out
for second place after St. Mary’s, not
unlike boring Chelsea, have usually
taken the laurels. Not surprising for
an institution that offers degrees in
running quickly, perspiring, calorie
counted diets and stretching! The
landscape of last season looks as
follows: top three teams for males,
St. Mary’s, IC, UCL and for females
St. Mary’s, UCL and IC. As you may
guess, we have a particular soft spot
for University College.
Cross-country is a team sport
with the first 6 to score in the men’s
and 3 in the women’s (luckily few for
us). The league takes us to excit-
ing wildernesses such as Richmond,
Reading and Victoria Park to com-
pete on trails, hills, woodlands and
roads. Spikes or fell-shoes are the
accessories of choice, though races
are also good for getting trainers
muddy and thus upping the wear-
er’s street credentials. Men are
usually expected to run 5 miles
while women escape with 2.5 miles.
Somewhere between ten and twelve
colleges are represented by both
male and female teams in differ-
ent divisions. Numbers are usually
good with Parliament Hill this year
attracting 99 males and 44 females
of an assortment shapes, sizes and
abilities.
In the women’s race a Harriet-
Angharad-Harrietsandwichensured
that IC finished 4th in the race stand-
ings. Harriet Scott, the star of our
title, had a very composed race and
led the race from start to finish in a
very uncompromisingly strong dis-
play of grit. Unfortunately Harriet
was such an undiscovered gem that
we didn’t even get a photo of her and
people in the club are still stand-
ing about scratching their heads
mouthing “Harriet who?”. Hopefully
we’ll be able to bring you a picture
of photogenic Harriet in action in
the next race at Richmond Park.
Angharad Care, a veteran from
previous seasons, also had a fine
race and seems to have discovered
some extra gears to finish a very
impressive 7th. Harriet Kirk and
Anjali Chakraborty also had very
fine first outings for IC bringing the
total number of women to 4. Without
them we would have been looking
at the disappointing prospect of not
being able to field a women’s team.
We applaud them. On a serious note,
I would like to use this opportunity
to ask all women with a low rest-
ing pulse rate to consider compet-
ing. The endorphins can be most
rewarding and there are many fit
blokes about who would be delight-
ed to receive a little of their atten-
tion over post-race drinks. With one
of our friendly alcohol fuelled grop-
ers away in Germany and the other
one keeping a rather low profile I
can vouch for their safety. At the
moment, we are just a few women
short of a very competitive x-coun-
try team and a new golden era of
women’s running at Imperial. It
must be stressed that x-country at
Imperial is a very sociable, inclusive
and friendly experience. Nowhere is
this more in evidence than with the
jovial greetings of Chris Mullington.
Chris, bronzed and just back from a
Hawaiian triathlon was far from shy
in treating everyone to a glimpse
of his tan-lines by pulling down his
shorts. If it wasn’t for a girl called
Lisa and her vodka-fuelled drunk-
en, and indeed lewd accounts of
bedroom antics with Chris, we may
well be worried sharing the same
changing room. A little effeminate
peacock though he may be, Chris is
an athlete of the finest caliber and
was first IC man home in a very
commendable 13th, helped in no
small way by the enigmatic Dave
X selflessly pacing him through the
first lap and a half. Although Dave’s
mate Will was trying to get us to buy
that the “X” was actually short for
x-rated necrophilia in the pub later
that evening, it turned out on race
day that the only “X” we could con-
sider was the eXorcism of the ghost
of one Sebastian Venus from Dave.
Seb spent much of last season taunt-
ing Dave for his race impotency.
Although Dave finished well up the
race order, unfortunately Seb has
become an automaton at one of the

City banks and won’t be coming back
to play in the mud with us again.
Of the 25 men who donned a sin-
glet (or a vest as the natives call
them) for IC, there were many solid
performances and hectic sprint fin-
ishes. Too many to mention but par-
ticularly noteworthy was new club
helmsman Tarik Amer, who skipped
around the course wearing head-
phones while holding hands with
his fellow competitor and girlfriend
Anjali. Final mention goes to Pete
Dickenson, who gets his name in ink
for a recapture of the coveted “King
of the Hill” title. Uncontested to the
summit, Pete graciously accepted
the plaudits of the St. Mary’s run-
ners before gentlemanly stepping
aside to allow them and 72 other
runners by in a very charitable dis-
play. Dave X had a closer shave last
year, when young Irishman Vinnie
O’Sullivan almost collapsed a lung
in an effort to shadow Dave to the
top, duped into thinking that Dave
was some running machine.
So just to recap: Imperial were 3rd
in the men’s and 4th in the women’s.
All in all, a concrete start but much
work to be done! I promise that
we’ll have our cameramen trailing
Harriet Scott next time for our next
report. Hopefully she’ll be a motiva-
tion for other women to come and
compete. Finally I look forward to
the next race and the subsequent
report when the pen will be passed,
and those who have had their toes
trampled can exact some revenge.

Having been sent to the wrong pitch-
es by the boys from the aforemen-
tioned polytechnic we started play
15 minutes late. The match started
well with IC dominating their obese
excuse for a pack at the break down
and some great breaks from Matt le
Bang, Johnny the Jock and Rob ‘Odd
Job’ Gaskell led to us being camped
in their ’22. A lucky interception try
by their off side centre meant that
they took the lead. At this point
Sachin ‘Brown Bullet’ Amin came
on and the dominance continued but
we lacked the precision to convert
this into points meaning that the
first half ended 7-0 to them.
The second half saw Sam, Ben
and Chrissy G come on. A change in
the game plan led to excellent pick
and goes, particularly from James
Davies, Sam the fresher and the
Brown Bullet. This allowed Paul
Tench to beat his man and score
under the posts which was con-
verted James ‘Wilko’ Fletcher. More
pressure led to their hooker being
sin binned for being an off-side dick-
head and the resulting penalty was
slotted home by ‘Wilko’ to make the
final score 10-7 to ICURFC Trees.
On the afternoon of Wednesday 19th
October the netball club 1st team
made their way to King’s College
sports ground in Berrylands. I don’t
know exactly where it is; only that it’s
a long way from South Kensington!
After warming up and having a
team talk we were ready to “win” as
according to Jen we had to win as
she’d told her friends we were really
good (no pressure)!
“We were all very
tired – but we ener-
gised our game and
put a few in the net”
The whistle blew and the first
quarter began. After a few min-
utes, with goals on both sides, we
started settling into the game, get-
ting accustomed to King’s style of
play. There were times when the
passing was a bit erratic and we
threw passes away unnecessarily
but we slowed down and got a few
goals back. When the whistle blew
for quarter time we were one goal
down but had the next centre pass
to regain a level score.
During the second quarter we
raised our game and started com-
municating better on court. We
played more like a team, our pass-
ing became stronger and there were
some good interceptions from the
defence, some of which we convert-
ed into goals. We were ahead as we
went into half time.
On Tuesday at training we started
zoning/zone marking for the first
time but hadn’t put it into our game
so far. However it was decided we
would try it on King’s first backline
pass. Out on court again for the
third quarter and we used the first
available opportunity to try out our
zoning. It was quite interesting but
not too successful – something I’m
sure we will work on at training!
Unfortunately we seemed to lose our
concentration for a period, throwing
the ball away unnecessarily and we
weren’t converting enough of our
interceptions into goals. So we fin-
ished the third quarter several goals
down.
Pep talk time! We knew that we
weren’t far behind, and also realised
we could win and should win as we
were playing very well.
“The main thing is
that we won and
are developing as a
team”
The 4th quarter had a bit of a
lethargic start (we were all very
tired) but we energised our game
and put a few in the net. The last
quarter was quite intense and none
of us knew what the score was until
the final whistle was blown. It was
45-44 at the end and I think most of
the team thought King’s had won, so
it was amazing when we found out
that the win was ours!
The main thing is that we won and
are developing as a team. We cer-
tainly have a few things we need to
practice at in training (including not
running into the same space –Jen
and Thea, who we thought might
pass out in the 4th quarter after
a spectacular head-on collision!)
but the team looks very promising.
Watch this space!

The first BUSA match of the season
for ICSM’s first team. New faces
Machine, Goldilocks and The Wall
joined our squad as we trekked up
to Hatfield for a match we did not
think we would win. Captain MRSA
however, got us there an hour early
and we looked a lot more profes-
sional than we felt. Hertfordshire
were looking small and dumpy after
the summer and our spirits began
to rise. We won the first quarter and
it became clear to all that Machine
was unbeatable scoring every goal.
She doesn’t even waste time blink-
ing! Second quarter we drew, prob-
ably due to the conditions. Indoor
netball is not a pretty sight: sweaty,
smelly and claustrophobic. Our Chav
switched from attack to defence and
we took the third quarter. Cheeks
made some fantastic moves link-
ing with Goldilocks and Optimus
Prime. By this time Chimney, as
ever, was getting aggressive and
providing plenty of physical abuse
– certainly not a ladies game when
she’s around! Into the final quar-
ter we went hungry for a victory.
Optimus Prime stepped up, more
active than we have ever seen her
before. MRSA near exhaustion
pushed on and Gobby fouled her
way to the end. The lead was ours
and the final whistle went. Well done
ladies…bring on Reading.

punished!
Medic Win!
I ask you before reading this weeks’
column to forgive me for indulging
in a topic very close to my heart.
As a member of the esteemed IC
Football Club since the start of term
I have been regularly attending
training at Harlington on Monday
nights. “Good for you son. So what?”
I hear you murmur. The College
website proudly boasts of the floodlit
astroturf of which our hockey teams
takes full advantage. This is fantas-
tic; if you happen to play hockey.
For those sportsmen and women
who are in either a football or rugby
squad Monday night training ses-
sions fail to reach their full potential
owing to the lack of floodlights. Both
groups have to share two semi-lit
grass pitches, some of which only
owe the light they do get to their
adjacency to the astroturf.
More floodlights at Harlington
wouldprevent attendanceattraining
dropping off as players become dis-
enchanted with giving up an evening
for little or no benefit to their game.
This would benefit teams as they
would have a fitter, more technically
proficient squad and would also help
clubs ailing finances as we would
have more paying passengers to
offset the cost of coach hire. I will be
pressing this issue with our Union
representatives in the hope that one
day all teams may train under glori-
ous artificial golden beams!
