Breakfast at Soﬁtels
Felix catches up with the directors at the London Film Festival
I
stood at a corner of the Tube
car, watching the people
around me. It’s the London
Film Festival and I just got
back from breakfasting with the
directors at Sofitels. Last Friday, I
had the opportunity of meeting Yvan
Le Moine. Acclaimed director of the
eccentric The Red Dwarf, he’s back
this festival with a shocking version
of Robinson Crusoe titled Friday or
Another Day that includes cabaret
singing (yes, cabaret).
According to him, what he does
as a director (as he points to a glass
of sparkling water) is to show the
world the story of one bubble’s life
as it fizzes to the end of its life at
the top of the glass (right…). Maybe
he meant to imply that our lives
are short just like the bubbles and
he’s simply telling the story of one
human being. At that point, I started
to wonder, what makes one human
being’s life so interesting that it’s
worth telling the world about?
There’s a cute little girl standing
next to me. She has a stuffed rac-
coon in one hand while the other
holds on the blue railing for dear
life. I look at her (and hopefully, she
didn’t notice) and saw her smile at
her mother. Her mother is perhaps
40 years of age with smile wrinkles
around her eyes. I loved her smile
wrinkles and if I were to ever make
a movie, it’ll be a collage of moments
just like that one.
Last Sunday, I joined the directors
for breakfast and met up with Liu
Jia Yun, the director of Ox Hide. One
look at the title and it makes you
think about cowboys and extremely
cold weather. However, the truth
is far from it. It’s a documentary of
her family and the problems they
are going through. Family problems
are one and a dozen but her family’s
constant optimism was what shone
through and she received an award
in the Vancouver Film Festival.
Unfortunately for her, due to some
organisation mess-up, there was no
one to show her around London.
It was a Sunday and I had nothing
better to do. Hence, I got to spend
the afternoon with her. She’s not
much older than most of us and
she carries a toy bunny with her.
However, I was pleasantly awed by
her story of how her personality has
changed since she entered the film
competition.
The Film Festival has its share of
foreign romantic comedies too. One
of them is the film Uttarayan from
India. Uttarayan is a film about a
widow and a widower finding love
for the second time. What makes
this film so unique that it made it
into an international film festival?
During my short chat with the direc-
tor, Bipin Nadkarni, and the pro-
ducer. They told me that the story
appealed to them because of how
laid-back and relaxed it was.
I was a bit surprised by the word
“relaxed”. It was partially because
in a conservative society like India, a
remarriage should be a little close to
An Apology
Film Felix would like to apologize for the act of plagiarism committed last
week for the review on Howl’s Moving Castle. The person in question will be
temporarily suspended from reviewing films due to their misjudgment.

taboo. However, according to Bipin,
Indian society is changing and the
critics are anxious not to be branded
as narrow-minded buffoons. Hence,
they are now more than willing to
embrace anything new and shock-
ing. That probably explains why the
film received an award from the
President of India.
Dreaming of Space is another one
of those films that some might find
perplexing. It’s a film about a man in
transition. Set in the 1950’s when the
Soviet Union still existed, this man
Viktor tries to break free from his
dead-end life as a waiter by imitat-
ing his worldly and out-going new-
found friend, Gherman. Director
Alexey Uchitel said he would like
the film to motivate people so that
they can make positive changes in
their lives.
It’s a film rich in symbology that
might strike a strong chord among
the Russians. “It’s not a film about
politics” he says. “It’s just a story
about a man who wants to achieve
his dreams.”
The London Film Festival is a col-
lage of films about people. Hence, it
wouldn’t be too far off to say that it’s
a film festival that celebrates life. As
producer of Uttarayan said, “Once
you stop falling in love with any-
thing, you stop living.” Therefore,
be prepared to fall in love with the
films in the London Film Festival.
Oops-here’s my stop! Ciao!

Dive ‘Into the Blue’

Into the Blue

Certificate: U
Released:19 October 2005

t’s a simple story. Jared (Paul
Walker) and Sam (Jessica
Alba) are a lovely couple who
live a simple life by the sea.
Sam is happy but Jared isn’t
and he dreams of discovering a fan-
tastic wreck one day (all for Sam, of
course).
Enter the cunning, greedy and
malicious Bryce (Scott Caan) and his
current lady-of-the-week Amanda
(Ashley Scott). Bryce is Jared’s
older brother but they couldn’t be
more different (yes, that includes
their height.).
On a leisure diving trip, the four
of them discover a shipwreck and
a plane wreck crammed full of
A-grade cocaine. Jared and Sam
(being the typical couple they are)
want to leave the cocaine alone but
Bryce and Amanda are not about to
walk away from millions of dollars’
worth of cocaine.
To begin with Into the Blue is a
late summer flick. Nobody should
expect a life-changing experience.
The storyline is simple and easy to
follow. The soundtrack is not inspir-
ing but it is fitting for its targeted
demographic. The costumes...what
can I say? Less is definitely more for
their target audience.
Form your own opinion about
Into the Blue. I wouldn’t lie and
say it’s something new or special
from Hollywood because it’s based
on a commonly used principle (that
is, beautiful people sell movies).
However, The Times Movie Mania
gave out free tickets to it. How bad
can it be?

Free tickets!
T
he Times Movie Mania
is at it again! Thanks to
them, Felix has two free
tickets to give away to
Elizabethtown (the latest Orlando
Bloom film)! I know you girls must
be drooling but don’t drool just yet!
Find out how you can get your hands
on these tickets!
Elizabethtown is Orlando Bloom’s
first foray into romantic comedy.
Playing an anally uptight Drew
Baylor, he is forced to return home
to Kentucky when his father passes
away. Who could have guessed that
on his flight back, he meets and falls
in love with the quirky but oh-so-lov-
able Cate Colborn.
Be the first person to tell Felix
what Cate Colborn works as in the
film (guys - it’s Kirsten Dunst!).
Email Felix at film.felix@ic.ac.uk
with your answer, name and depart-
ment!
Stop drooling and start emailing!
Would you give up wealth for her?
