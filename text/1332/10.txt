upon setting foot in Kenya. The situ-
ation is further compounded by the
death of their baby boy. Heartbroken,
Tessa throws herself into investigat-
ing the pharmaceutical companies
operating in Kenya.
Perhaps some things are better
left alone because not long after,
Tessa is found brutally murdered.
Justin’s usual peaceful equilibrium
is knocked off balance and he sets
out to discover the reasons behind
his wife’s death. Holding on to his
faith in Tessa, he overcomes all
obstacles (death threats and multi-
ple beatings) to find out what Tessa
had given her life for.
Firstly, the storyline was good.
However, conspiracies are getting
a little old. It surprises me that a
film with such a plot was used as
the opening one. There were some
uniquely beautiful scenes that must
be mentioned though. The direc-
tor did a fantastic job in the devel-
opment of the love affair between
Justin and Tessa. To put it simply
(without gushing), it was intimate,
poignant and beautiful.
There were beautiful landscape
shots of Africa and the movie did
help highlight the plight faced by
the people in Africa. And it should
come as no surprise that the acting
was superb. After all, Ralph Fiennes
and Rachel Weisz do have enough
experience to carry this film to the
Oscars. Nevertheless, good acting
or otherwise, it doesn’t save the
plot cliché. The days when we were
inclined to believe in ‘X-Files’ con-
spiracy theories are over. What can I
say except- better luck next time!

L
ady Luck must be shining
down on Ralph Fiennes
because he is none
other than the lead in
the opening film for the
London Film Festival, The Constant
Gardener. I have to admit I was a bit
baffled by the title (especially since
I have yet to read John le Carre’s
works). The title indicates a film
similar to stories such as Tuesdays
with Morrie, and as meaningful as
that might be, it’s not my cup of
tea. To my surprise, The Constant
Gardener was very far from a philo-
sophical textbook.
Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes)
is a passive, reserved diplomat for
the British High Commission with
a passion for gardening. Before he
sets off for Kenya, he chances upon
Tessa Abbott (Rachel Weisz). Unlike
him, Tessa is loud, wild, passion-
ate and outspoken. Perhaps it is
the old adage of opposites attract.
Regardless, Justin and Tessa fall
madly in love, get married and move
to Kenya.
However, it’s not a simple movie of
‘happily-ever-after’ because things
go downhill after the wedding.
Unfortunately for Justin, his wife
becomes increasingly estranged

Kinky boots on the silver screen?
It’s time to kick in some changes around here.
T
he title itself is a big atten-
tion grabber. Kinky Boots
does not just refer to a
slightly perverted sexual
pleasure but also to the shoe fetish-
ism common among women today.
After having spotted the Selfridges
window display that further illus-
trated this grand fantasy, I just had
to go watch the movie.
Without a clue to what the movie
entails, I expected to be enchanted
by millions of shoes that you only get
to see on the catwalk of haute cou-
ture fashion shows. Little did I know
that it was a film about transvestites
singing and dancing amidst the set-
ting of a glum shoe factory.
The presence of a plot was surpris-
ing despite its predictability. Father
owns shoe factory, father dies and
son takes over factory. The differ-
ence here is a transvestite named
Lola, also a show-girl, rescues the
shoe factory from bankruptcy. Lola
helps save Price & Sons, a compa-
ny known for making quality men’s
shoes that last a lifetime, by con-
vincing Charlie, the son, to tailor
women’s shoes for men.
The shoes in this movie are tacky
and gaudy to the max (that explains
the presence of Elton John at the
premiere). The highlight was per-
haps the pair of plastic, red, snake-
skin, thigh-high boots (sounds like a
good idea for Halloween? Not).
Strange enough, this duo (an
extroverted transvestite and a con-
servative gentleman) is so success-
ful that they are soon showcasing
their collection in Milan (the land of
fashion gods and goddesses)!
Although the film has a classic
Hollywood storyline (with a happy
ending), transexuality was not a
theme they explored thoroughly.
Nevertheless, I found answers to
questions I had had about men who
liked to dress as women (I’m not tell-
ing you the questions or the answers
- go see the movie yourself). I also
learnt that “the sex is in the heel”,
something which I will keep in mind
the next time I need to dress to
impress.
This is definitely a movie to see if
you like shoes and are in need of a
few laughs. There have been several
complaints that Kinky Boots should
highlight the plight of the company
that is about to fold instead of kid-
ding about cross-dressing. Like I
said, don’t expect a soul-searching
movie. Just don your highest heels,
(which by the way is in this sea-
son) and sing your heart away this
Halloween!
