For some of us, the situation is all
too familiar: it’s Sunday morning,
your head’s hurting and you turn
over to find an unrecognisable girl
(or guy) lying in your bed. There’s
no milk in the fridge and the bread’s
turned mouldy. Where the hell are
you going to take them for break-
fast? Relax, Ping & Paul have the
answer.
Seasons, 24 Thurloe Street, SW7
2LT (5/10)
£3.00: Sausage, 2 bacon, egg,
beans, chips, toast, tea.
Seasons, for those of you who don’t
know, is the fish n’ chip shop near
South Ken tube. Despite being in the
centre of South Ken, the food here
could have been served on Brick
Lane to some down-and-out art stu-
dents cruising the retro markets.
Inside it’s dark, gloomy and full of
builders which is normally a good
sign since builders tend to like their
greasy breakfasts. Unfortunately,
the builders in South Ken must be a
little out of the ordinary as well.
The breakfast had many good fea-
tures, mainly the cheap prices, the
W
hilst I like to think
I’m the bee’s knees
when it comes to
cooking, I accept that
my attitude towards
food may lean precariously close to
pretentious. Though in the morn-
ing I prefer my eggs delicately
poached with a sprinkling of herbs
on granary bread and a side of fried
tomatoes, other people have very
different ideas. The charming Ping
and Paul have risked coronaries and
grease stains by sampling some of
K&C’s best breakfast spots. Enjoy
with a strong cup of builder’s tea,
something even I can appreciate.......

This week Ping and Paul investigate SW7’s ﬁnest greasy spoons
well cooked bacon and eggs and
the good old-fashioned thick chips.
However, the sausage was German
and watery, so if you’re a fan of con-
tinental breakfasts then you’ll prob-
ably like this place more than us.
La Brioche, 40 Old Brompton
Road, SW7 3DY (8/10)
£3.50: Sausage, 3 bacon, fried egg,
mushrooms, beans, 2 toast, (tea,
optional £1 extra) pictured on left
We arrived bright and early Sunday
morning (i.e. noon) to be greeted
by a friendly Spanish lady who
promptly took our order and started
making us tea. The café was quiet
but the food was turned out very
quickly. The toast arrived first and
was devoured instantly; breakfast
followed shortly and was definitely
less greasy than other more typical
English breakfasts. The highlight
of Brioche’s breakfast has to be the
mushrooms – something a little dif-
ferent from the ordinary and nicely
flavoured, they were definitely the
magic ingredient in this breakfast.
Couple this with freshly fried bacon
and a meaty Lincolnshire sausage

food & drink
A quickie before college?
and we’re talking a satisfying fryup.
We have to complain about the
eggs however; thick white and a
runny yolk. As for the additional £1
charge for tea! The tea consumption
of this reviewer vastly increased
the cost of an otherwise good value
breakfast.
JCR, Main Walkway (7/10)
Sausages, bacon, egg (fried &
scrambled), hash browns, beans,
tomato, mushrooms, toast, black
pudding, kippers, porridge, cereals,
fruit, tea
Why not start the day with a quick
brekkie before lectures. The JCR is
known to all on campus, although its
food has a reputation for being pret-
ty unhealthy– it’s only unhealthy if
you eat it everyday...
The JCR breakfast is a lot better
than most students who buy expen-
sive French pain au chocolat from
the JCR shop tend to think. It’s a
great place to hang out with your
mates, so why not munch on break-
fast at the same time. The prices are
all student friendly, but don’t forget
to bring change in the morning oth-
erwise the cashier dude won’t be too
pleased.
The hash browns and sausages
are tasty, although sizes and varie-
ties vary from day to day. The bacon
is not recommended due to its lack
of crispness and its comparatively
expensive price. The kippers make
the JCR stand out, injecting some
English pride into our college - but
only if you’re awake early enough to
get them.
If you like a little bit of grease on
your sausages, hot baked beans and
have a fetish for hash browns, then
the JCR is for you.
Next time with Ping and Paul:
On our way to La Brioche, we
saw this new place near Organic
Pizza in South Ken, so we popped
in to look at the menu. When the
waitress walked over and asked if
she could help, I looked up and my
jaw dropped. It took me a minute to
engage first gear, by which time she
had gathered I wasn’t just looking at
the menu. Embarrassed I promptly
left, but I’ll be back- look out for it in
a future edition.
