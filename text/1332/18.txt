The Prison House centres around
Jimmy, a convict held for reasons
left unspecified until the end, and
recounts both his incarceration in
the hellish Seven Towers prison and
events from his past.
Understandably, those who do not
appreciate distressing or unpleas-
ant subject matter would best be
advised to avoid John King’s works.
The Prison House in particular
starts off bleak, dark and nasty then
continues in this vein until the end.
Yet nonetheless it is not an espe-
cially depressing read (if you can
get past the various acts of sadism
and the like that occur throughout)
given that a central theme of the
novel is hope there are moments of
levity and a sense of humour pre-
vails that is not always as bleak as
one might expect.
King makes few concessions
toward accessibility. The reader is
somewhat thrown in at the deep end
with regards to the story, beginning
as it does with a none too pleasant
rape scene.
But if one can cope with such
obstacles, there is a rewarding, edi-
fying read at its heart.

The Prison House
by John King
Hugh Stickley Mansfield
In recent years it has become de
rigeur for any cinematic or liter-
ary phenomenon to have a parody
knocked off and published as soon
as possible in order to cash in as
effectively as possible.
As such, it is somewhat bemusing
to encounter a recently published
“parody” of Bill Bryson’s A Short
History of Nearly Everything, itself
published some two and a half years
ago, and although selling well, hard-
ly a publishing phenomenon even at
the time.
It soon becomes clear, however,
that this is not a parody in the truest
sense - beyond sending up the title,
this book bears no resemblance to
that which it is, apparently, lam-
pooning. Where its predecessor is
an in-depth tome detailing physics,
chemistry, geology and the like, this
is a collection of inane, pointless
trivia about stuff, things and other
such weighty matters.
Inside are found the same collec-
tion of poorly chosen facts, although
this time the subject matter is more
constrained focusing, as the title
suggests, on Britain.
It is quite inconceivable that any-
one would buy this sort of novelty tat
for themselves, so the target market
would appear to be those panic-buy-
ing presents for unpopular relations
and vague acquaintances in the last
few seconds before Christmas.
Worth giving a miss, on the whole.

M
y two pence: this is
powerful and shock-
ing; a work of bril-
liance that will leave
you in awe at the
depths of thought that could possi-
bly have crafted such a novel full of
laughter and tears. A very original
style of writing – stick with it, it is
definitely worth it. Told from the
perspective of a small girl, one of a
pair of “two-egg” twins separated at
a young age. This is a story of the
destruction of a small happy family,
the society that smiled and nodded
in approval at the pain it saw as
right and a victim who inevitably
became more useful to the world
dead than he ever was alive. Winner
of the Booker Prize 1997 it is, in a
word, different.
Ms Roy has done something quite
extraordinary in the writing of this
novel. She has attempted to ruth-
lessly open our eyes to the hypoc-
risy that exists in society, in an
uncompromising and brutal man-
ner, with no sense of hope or silver
lining to her dark cloud, while, at the
same time, endeavouring to tell us
a story. No, this novel is not political
rhetoric about social justice or free-
dom, in its blatant sense, nor is it the
kind superimposed onto a story to
oh-so-subtly put the author’s politi-
cal ideology into the reader’s head.
No, something of that nature would
depressing. It will make you laugh,
that I can guarantee to every reader
who knows how to laugh, but it will
be the kind of laughter that can only
be accompanied by tears. Ms Roy’s
viewpoint demands a completely
new style of writing to portray the
innocence of the young girl and how
she views the world, and she deliv-
ers marvellously. Ms Roy allows the
reader to be fully aware of the loss
to come very early on. She gets rid
of the ‘standard’ cliff-hanger that is
used by so many authors to drop the
‘bad news’ as a proverbial bomb-
shell and make emotional capital
out of the reader’s unsuspecting
mind as it reels to the sudden pain
inflicted upon the story’s charac-
ters. Stepping out of this trend with
an obvious flair, she daringly flaunts
every secret to the reader, in what
may be considered a risky step sure
to lose the reader’s interest, instead
of keeping them guessing. However,
the effect if quite the opposite; with
the tragedy already revealed, every
happy moment viewed in hindsight
is tinged with the pain of what is to
come. As we get to know our char-
acters better, the pain becomes all
the more real. Laughter and tears
indeed.
Comparable in passion and nar-
rative to To Kill a Mockingbird by
Harper Lee but on a wider scope
of themes and issues, this beauti-
ful novel left this reader reeling.
The refreshing pace, writing style
and comfortable, oblivious bliss
of the central character all add to
the overall power of a simple story
which leave the reader questioning
the meaning of love and the value
of life.
The God of Small Things

have been expected and ‘normal’, in
the literary world. What Ms Roy has
actually given us is a piece of litera-
ture (and I certainly mean literature
in every sense of the word) that puts
forward an incredibly human story,
brimming with sad humour and gut
wrenching tragedy, told through the
most innocent of voices. In telling us
this simple and incredible story, she
brings to life every single injustice
and pain she rages against. This is
the real power of the narrative. It
never attempts to anchor the reader
down to a particular theme, be it per-
sonal tragedy or political angst. It
combines so many things and under
Ms Roy’s masterful hand it succeeds
and leaves the reader with a tap-
estry of what it is to be human and
what it means to love.
This book is certainly centred on
a tragedy, but it is by no means

societies carry out their activities as easily and cheaply as possible.
We have a team of dedicated staff who love our minibuses, land-
rover and trailers and they are looking for people who love vans as
much as them to join them. Ideally you will be over 21 with a full
driving licence (but that isn’t essential). More than anything you will
love vans as much as us!
