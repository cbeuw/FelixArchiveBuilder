I am utterly disappointed to see
not a single one of you wanting
to pay the good Mr Wright a
visit; I thought Imperial students
were opinionated and energetic
creatures. Clearly, I’ve caught you
on a bad week – I’m aware fresher’s
flu and glandular fever are doing
the rounds. The kissing disease can
be a very distressing thing if you’re
anywhere near as capricious as I
am! *sigh*
Those were the days.. my
gregariousness is very much a
thing of the past. A bout of the
abovementioned flu put paid to my
sex drive, and as a result, I’ve not
been able to spread myself around
town as liberally as I’m known to be
capable of ;)
However, not baring my Brazilian
has led to adventures of another
kind. No, not the romantic kind –
just the flirtatious; romance is dead,
as Lisa Simpson let us know on
Valentine’s. It’s been homogenised
and commercialised by Hallmark,
the way in which two thousand
years of Indian culture has been
compacted into one bite-sized
Walkers’ tikka masala crisp.
My adventures began when I got
allocated an extremely attractive
placement partner. Mr T, as he
shall be known, has indie hotness
oozing out of every pore. His tight
pinstriped drainpipes do wonders
for his slender (convex) buttocks,
and his dark curly mop and cheeky
dimples make my world go round.
All very well, until I discover that
Mr T has got a girlfriend. A long
distance one of three years and
counting. What’s a lady got to
do when her pride is at stake?
Take the high road and walk it,
that’s what – I’m not going to be
branded a homewrecker when just
sweetness and light are at stake.
I’d think twice if better grades, in
the case of a course examiner were
the goods on offer. Or a fully-funded
black Amex card, come to think of
it.
Material concerns aside, I
unexpectedly ran into mystery
man II. He came in the shape of a
Sagittarian sex-god renowned for
playing drums in one of the world’s
best metal bands. His rhythm was
intact, and his Atlantan drawl got
me all flustered. When hearing that
he wanted to hang out with me
come his next visit to the UK, I wet
my pants. Supposedly my accent
had got him in a spot of bother! I’d
rather not wonder what sort of tizz
his wife would be in if she heard
of my dulcet tones – she’s one of
my personal heroes, I’ll have you
know, so I’d hate to be the one to
break her life when she inspired me
greatly into making mine.
Fallen idols aside, there’s little
keeping my hands busy. I’ve got
the Travel Channel’s Zay Harding
to think of when I close my eyes
and go to sleep. Felix and IC Radio
haven’t produced the goods this
year – there’s only one member of
the music team I’d like to get my
hands on! To my dismay, everybody
else would like to get their hands on
him too, so I’ve got a funny feeling
that a certain trumpet-playing
third- year medic at Chelsea is
going to have to play lust object for
me once again. Life goes in circles,
and circles make the world go
round.
Dear Freshers and Sharks
I don’t
understand
why our union
does not have a
specific ban on
Hizub ut-Tahir

This is the Leader
Apparently it isn’t clear that this is
the leader column of Felix. Well it
is. For those of you that don’t know
a leader is where the newspaper
expresses its views on the news. So
its also an editorial.
Extremists at Imperial
Its quite worrying that such
persons were at our Freshers
Fayre. The fact they were posing as
something else is even scarier, one
of them actually stopped me asked
if I wanted to sign their petition.
I don’t normally sign petitions as
a rule (journalists should try not
to have strong views), but people
could have been signing what they
thought to be a harmless petition
only to discover later that in fact
they were putting their name to
something else entirely.
It seems that Imperial is no the
only university with this problem,
the issue made the front page
of The Beaver, LSE’s student
newspaper, last week. But it is a
problem we should be working on.
I don’t understand why our Union
does not have a specific ban on
Hizub ut-Tahir. If the NUS view
them as such a problem to place
a specific ban why does our Union
not see fit to apply such a ban. I
know ICU feel they are above the
NUS, but surely in this case they
should follow the NUS’s example.
A specific ban on the group would
surely send them a stronger
message than a blanket equal
opportunities policy.
Although they were present at
Freshers’ Fayre there is nothing
to suggest that there is an active
presence at College. So please don’t
worry unnecessarily, although if
you do have any specific concerns
contact College authorities or the
police.
Congestion charge
The western extension of the
congestion charge to include the
area surrounding Imperial’s South
Ken campus must surely be a good
thing for both students and staff.
Nearly all students use public
transport to get to College, a large
number of those using buses.
Since the introduction of conges-
tion charging in central London,
bus journey times have decreased
dramatically. As a result we should
all be able to spend a few more pre-
cious minutes in bed.
