Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
Someone or some-
thing giving you the
creeps this week? My
suggestion is this,
carry plenty of sweets
and loose change in
preparation for confrontation with
a knee high pumpkin bearing a
lightsaber.
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
Trick or treating will
release your inner
child, and you’ll be on
such a high. How-
ever you’re attentions
will be focused on a
certain mysterious stranger as you
find yourself relishing this piece of
eye candy, and I’m not talking about
the sweets.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Who says Michael
Myers was dead,
you will embrace the
Halloween season as
you’re mind opens up
and you become less
cynical about the world.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
This week may be
your chance to prove
to all that you are not
the evil witch they
all think you are. If
anyone mentions the
wart you can always turn them into
a toad.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Be warned this week
you may find eerie
strangers testing your
resolve. Avoid dark
lecture theatres and
keep your wits about
you
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
Ah. Was it just the
wind….? If your
feeling a little more
than spooked this
week, don’t take any
chances.
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
It may be a good idea
to keep a low profile
this weekend, as there
are some creatures
of the night, baying
for blood. Hopefully
with a heafty frying pan and a bulb
of garlic you can stop it from being
yours.
Gemini (May 22nd –Jun 21st)
I know how you love
this time of year, al-
though I rather think
you enjoy tricking
more than treating.
Enjoy all in modera-
tion thou, as if you laugh too hard
your head may fall off.
Cancer (Jun 22nd –Jul 22nd)
You’ll find yourself in
unfamiliar surround-
ings this week, scared
and alone. But all is
well, the library will be
the one place you are
truly safe. Strange but true...
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
Hubble bubble, toil
and trouble…..watch
your step or you’ll see
double. Keep your
wits about you, as the
time is right…..for you
to have a terrible fright!
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
The spirits have an
interesting plan for
you this week, but des-
tiny cannot be fulfilled
by staying indoors. A
dark stranger sport-
ing a devilish mask is just what the
ghosts had in mind for you, so be
sure to go tricking or you won’t get
your treat.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
Fair is foul and foul is
fair...hover through fog
and misty air. Keep
your broomstick close
to hand; you never
know when you may
need to fight more than dust.
Attack of the Killer Telephone.
Hey Miss C,
I just don’t know what to do. I’ve
made loads of new friends at uni,
one of whom is great, only problem
is that she won’t leave me alone. I
spend all day with her, during and
in-between lectures, but she’ll still
call me every night and just won’t
stop chatting for hours. She’s now
even taking to msn-ing me just
after we’ve hung up. It’s not that I
don’t like her but I’m running low
on things to talk about and she’s
just beginning to wear me down.
What do you suggest??
Stalked Scientist
Dear Stalked Scientist,
Oh dear what have you got yourself
into?? Well there are several
explanations for the way that she
is acting: 1) she’s just being overly
friendly and doesn’t realise that
her constant phone calling can be
taken as harassment; 2) She’s got
no friends and she’s you as her
last chance to join the world of
socialising; 3) She has a crush on
you and has never heard of subtlety;
4) She’s obsessed by you and you
may soon see her following your
every move, asking where you shop
and turning into your clone. In
any case, the solution is the same,
talk to her!!! I mean if she’s taken
to harassing you via msn mere
minutes after hanging up there is
a slight problem, there is also only
so much you can say to one person
especially if you see them all the
time. This is almost as near to
stalking without stalking as you can
get. There is that solution, or you
can go for the drastic option which
is to have plastic surgery, change
your name, phone number and put
on a French accent…it’s up to you!
Should I Stay or Should I Go?
Dear Miss C,
I’ve been kinda seeing someone for
a few weeks now. Due to medical
circumstances we’ve been unable
to have sex for the last month and
she just wants to be “friends”. In
another few weeks she’ll be able
to have sex again and well, when
we were doing it, it was amazing.
I mean, she screamed the house
down and came five or six times
on each occasion. She says it’s
really tough for her right now to
make physical contact with me
without wanting it to lead to sex,
which is frustrating. So I’m staying
non-physical and we just hang out
instead. The thing is she doesn’t
want me “waiting around” for her
to be able to get physical again, but
I’m not interested in chasing other
women. I’ve found one I really like
and would prefer to stick with her,
whatever’s going on. I’m pretty
sure she’s not looking at anyone
else, as we spend a lot of time
together. My question is: if I just
stick with her and be there until
she’s ready, will she think I’m a
pussy?
CoolNCaring
Dear CoolNCaring,
No! Oh my god, I didn’t even think
that people like you existed! You
have completely managed to take
my cynical nature by surprise,
which is no easy task!! No she
won’t think you’re a pussy. Mate she
obviously cares about you and had
the same previous impression of
men that I did, that you’re all out for
one thing. As you’ve said that due to
medical circumstances (just slightly
curious…..) she can’t really oblige
you in that sense, so she’s giving
you an easy out. This is your chance
to stand up and be a man and show
you care by staying put!! Maybe
it’ll work out, maybe it won’t, but
at least you’re giving it a chance.
Oh by the way nice comment about
your sexual prowess, just what
the entire of IC need to know!!
Honestly! Men!
To Screw or Not to Screw
Dear Miss C,
What should I do... The guy I’m in
love with - I don’t think he wants
a relationship with me, but he
definitely wants to screw me. I’ve
been holding out because I want
something more with him but now
I feel it’s becoming clear that will
never happen. Should I just fuck
the shit out of him in order to move
on OR maintain my pride and
dignity and let us walk away from
each other? It’s not like I don’t think
about sex with him a lot!
Torn Apart
Dear Torn apart,
You said its’ becoming clear that’s
all he wants from you?? How do you
know?? First and foremost you need
to talk to him and find out what he
actually does want from you. If it
ends up that all he wants is a shag
buddy then you need to walk away.
Sleeping with him is just asking
for trouble but hey maybe that’s
what you’re looking for. Be warned
though, going down that track has
every chance of you ending up as a
psycho obsessive stalker. If you’ve
really built up that much sexual
frustration then a one night stand
is an option, but I wouldn’t advise
going into any relationships until
you are defiantly over him or else
this could end up as a long term
problem. My main advice is talk
to him, you never know, men can
surprise you. Maybe he’s sitting
there pinning for you…..waiting for
you to make the first move.
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hey guys. I’m back again, and I’ve
got good news, the best letter I
receive next week will win a copy
of PC computer game Blitzkrieg
or a CD albulm of their choice
from the Felix pile-o-crap.
