have happened in the past five days
at uni have included getting my IC
login password changed without
being told about it, being able to get
in but not out of the biochemistry
building and oh, the new printing
system that did not recognise me.
You see, when you go away for
a year people forget you. They
assume that because you are
not in uni for the academic year,
you’ll somehow disapppear and
never come back or have probably
graduated or failed. But I haven’t!
I’m still registered and get full use
of my card you twits! I have another
gruelling year to go thank you very
much. But you know, there are
some places that never forget you.
They never forget you because you
owe them £10 on book fines. I love
the library.
When I was told I was an
unrecognised user, the kind library
help desk person told me to ring
the ICT on 49000 and ask them
about the new printing system and
to get me activated to use it. The
accented voice didn’t answer my
request and instead said to, “come
to the ICT room 348 and I’ll sort you
out”.
Do you know how terrifying the
Mech eng building is? He’s gonna
sort me out?! What the f***? so I
went up there and the guy (the
third guy I got shuttled to, I don’t
know if he was the ‘sort you out
guy’) said, “Right, well the new
printing system involves using just
your swipe card” and I had to cut
him short before I kicked his shin,
“I know how it works, it’s just I’m
not a recognised user”. “Riiiiight”.
He then asked me to email them
the exact wording of the error
message. Well after a while of
faffing about, I became an officially
recognised user of the new printing
system at 5.45pm. Whilst topping
up, the librarian told me that the
ICT printing service wouldn’t
be working from 6pm until the
following morning. Run little lady
before I pull your wig off.
After pouring my heart to a
dear friend I was not any happier.
No, you see, this friend was a
management year student from
last year who got 1000 free printing
units per term. My swipe card
had £5 worth of printing units but
low and behold, I found out that
this was in fact a loan that would
be repayed, by me, from the 1st
of November at a rate of £1 per
week. Great, add that to my over
draft and student loan why don’t
ya. The perks of the department
are limited. Sorry I meant non-
existant!
Oh I did miss IC. I really did.

Letters to the editor
Star Letter
Students still
UNITED in worry
Dear Felix,
Re: your story in issue 1328
regarding the new UNITE halls:
‘Students UNITED in worry’. It
seems that you have missed out on
half of the issue: Orient House, over
in Fulham. While it is considerably
closer to the South Kensington
campus than Picadilly Court, it is so
far from any convenient transport
routes that regardless of whether
one takes the bus, tube or merely
walks, it is likely to take over forty
minutes during rush hour.
In short, it is as inconvenient to
reach college from Orient House
as it is from Picadilly Court, and
considerably less so to reach
anywhere else in central London.
Add to this that the amenities
in the hall itself are pitiful in the
extreme: there are three washing
machines and driers amongst
nearly two hundred students, the
showers flood the bathrooms (and,
often, the carpet outside them) as
a matter of course. One of the lifts
has been out of service since the
first day and the other is slow and
frequently makes disconcerting
noises and there is only a small
common area which doubles as the
entrance hall, which makes it an
unpleasant place to spend much
time.
Worse still, the kitchens have
been cleaned only once so far,
despite assurances that they would
be every day, and vermin have been
spotted in some.
Yet nonetheless there is
no budget allowed for any
improvements that have been
suggested, although Picadilly Court
has been granted an expensive
swathe of improvements. They are
given precedence, being so far from
South Kensington despite, as I say,
Orient House being as lengthy a
journey away, and a higher rent.
The wardening team and hall
manager are doing an admirable
job in coping with this situation but
at the end of the day the residents
are still left in a very unfortunate
position.

How things change
Dear Editor,
I take a year out to do a placement
and boy have things changed! New
buildings, new buildings in the
process of being built, no Southside
(I repeat no friggin Southside bar!),
new entrance desk stuck under
the stairs in the Sherfield building
and a brand spanking new printing
service involving just the swipe
card.
Waterstones don’t do the free
year planners anymore. You should
have seen my face when they told
me. I was too shocked to slap the
shop assistant.

Ramadhan
Dear Editor,
Have you ever passed the JCR at
around sunset and seen a large
mass of people eating food together
or praying? Ever wondered who
they were and what exactly it is
that they are up to? Ever seen your
friend Aliya or Hasan get some
dates out of their bag and eat them
during a late lecture and think
to yourself “Boy, he/she must be
hungry”!
Well never fear your ICU islamic
society is here to fill you in on all
those mind-boggling questions!
For over one billion Muslims
throughout the world, Ramadhan is
a special month of the year, much
loved and anticipated by all. During
the month of Ramadhan, Muslims
fast from dawn to sunset every
day. We as Muslims believe that
Ramadhan was the month in which
the first verses of the holy Qur’an
(Words of God) were revealed to the
final messenger of God, Prophet
Mohammad (Peace be upon him-
pbuh). The sighting of the new
moon at the end of Ramadhan
heralds the celebration of Eid ul-
Fitr.
Fasting is nothing new to Islam. It
is indeed the practice and tradition
of many pious predecessors who
attained piety through fasting. For
example: the Qur’an mentions that
Prophet Moses used to fast for
40 days and Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh) said that Prophet David
used to fast for half of the year.
Also Prophet Jesus used to fast
for 40 days. So we find that both
Christians and Jews recognize
fasting as part of their worship
(Christians primarily during Lent,
and Jews during Yom Kippur).
For Muslims fasting is not
only abstaining from eating and
drinking, but also from vain speech
and foul language. Also, by cutting
oneself off from worldly comforts,
even for a short time, a fasting
person gains true sympathy with
those who go hungry as well as
growth in one’s spiritual life. Not to
mention the various health benefits
from fasting! It is therefore a time
for inner reflection, devotion to God
and self-control.
So next time you walk pass the
JCR you will know that this mass of
people is in fact a group of Muslims
opening their fast in each-others’
company! This is where you come
in.
We, your Islamic Society, invite
you to come and join us when we
open our fast to eat. Come and
pop in, buy some food (yummy
chicken and rice) and have a feel
of the atmosphere, or if you have
any questions about fasting why
not come down and we’ll be more
than happy to share with you our
experiences.
If you are interested in joining
us in opening our fast during
this special month of ours
please do contact me on nadia.

Student Opportunities
Fund
Dear Felix,
The Student Opportunities Fund
(SOF) has started another Fund-
raising Telethon. For those who
are not aware of the SOF, its aim
is to give money to students from
underprivileged families who are
extremely academically able. This,
I’m sure you will agree, is a very
laudable cause. However, the Fund
only supports a very small number
of students (around 20, although
this varies from year to year). Each
of the UG’s gets £5K a year and
each PG gets £10K, for the duration
of their course.
I’m all for getting as many able
people, from whatever background
into IC, and the fewer posh people
that come here the better, as far as
I’m concerned. However, I would
suggest that the amount of money
given to each student is unfair.
Presuming that each of these
students will get the maximum
student loan, possibly a government
bursary of around 2K, and no fees
to pay (under the current system
anyway), £5K seems more than
enough to get by. There are plenty
of IC students who are practically
financially independent from their
parents; working every day they’re
not in college.
I feel that the money raised
could be put to better use; half
the amount of the bursary and
give it to twice as many people for
example. Possibly use some of it to
further subsidise rent for first years
in halls. As a side issue, would
it not be fairer for the College to
means test for the amount of rent a
student pays. I would readily leave
my finances open to scrutiny if it
meant I would have to pay less rent
than some Tory rich kid.
I throw my full weight behind
raising money to balance out the
class disparity here at IC, but I
feel the money could be spent in a
manner that would benefit a wider
number of students, and as a result,
the College as a whole.
Yours truly,
Carl Nash
3rd Year
Swimming
So now that the complete chaos
of fresher’s week has calmed to the
choas of term I thought I’d go for a
nice swim (or as nice as St Mary’s
gets). I went on the internet before
I left to check it would be open, and
sure enough it said,
“Casual Swimming Opening
Times:
Monday - Friday
7:00am - 9:00am
12:00pm - 2:00pm
3:00pm - 7:00pm
Weekends
9:00am - 6:00pm”
Excellent, so off I went. Sadly when
I got there I found that the security
guard, while knowing the pool was
closed, had no idea about opening
times for this term, and when I
found a timetable it turns out the
pool is closed all weekend. This is a
real annoyance. I have lectures from
9am until 5pm or 6pm most days so I
can’t get to the morning, lunchtime
or evening swims and the only day
I would be able to make would be
thursday for the late night swim-
ming, but I have meetings then. I
appriciated being able to spend the
afternoon swimming on Saturdays
last year and it seems ridiculus to
stop us using the pool at weekends
especially while the sports centre
is still closed. When it reopens with
the free swimming will we still be
restricted to during the week?
