LIVE REVIEWS
Laurent Garnier has been a seri-
ous DJ before I was out of nappies.
He was the forerunner in the acid
house explosion as well as lead-
ing the world in the exploration of
the outer limits of electronic music,
earning the respect of the earliest
‘godfathers of techno’ in Detroit.
Being the first Ambassador for
the French house/techno stylee,
entering the scene well before the
Daft Punk duo from Paris, his music
touched an ever-expanding fan base
throughout Europe, creating a whole
new French electronic scene. In the
late 80’s he was the only Frenchman
to be playing sets at the legendary
Hacienda superclub in Manchester,
earning himself the title ‘Flying DJ’,
while also spending many years
playing Europe-wide sets in some
of the hottest clubs and festivals,
including ‘Wake Up’ in Paris’ Rex
Club and also making appearances
on radio shows including his spe-
cial project at Pedro recordings. His
efforts have been revered by crit-
ics, earning himself the title ‘Best
International DJ’ on many occa-
sions.
Laurent was up for a mammoth
8 hour set on Saturday. This was
no problem for the legendary
Frenchman; his relentless pro-
gramming and red-hot mixes pro-
vided perpetual electric shocks
to the dance floor and crazy bass
lines, turning sober one o’clockers
into debauched dance-floor fill-
ers. Playing up to his mythical sta-
tus among admirers he played a
mash up of every sound around.
With appearances from heavy D&B
tunes, warm old school bass lines
from Common Factor, bouncy elec-
tronica Da Beep, menacing and
dangerous subliminal bleeps with
a huge bass drive from The Angry
Ghost by Hug and even the hot new
dance track Day Break from the
indie rocker Daso. During the whole
set, Laurent never stopped acting
like a demented monkey on speed
but held a clear connection with the
crowd. This was a truly mad set,
and absolutely deserves a top rating
from Le Ros Bif.

More preview than review this, with
the live drum’n’bass act storming
back to London later this month to
launch their second album - Power
Ballads. Powerful they certainly
are, pulling the crowd with them in
all directions from the first beat to
the last; getting the crowd to sing
along, and huddle up, and perform
countless silly finger movements,
all the while grinning away as if
truly electrified. This is a unique live
drum’n’bass experience. The live
drumming of the exceptionally furi-
ous Jungle Drummer overwhelmed
the venue and feet of the crowd,
while Andy Waterson’s live double
bass somehow kept the beat and
kept it loud. London Elektricity per-
form without laptops or pre-record-
ed material on stage, preferring the
unpredictability of a group who at
times seem on the verge of explod-
ing out of their own energy, or being
engulfed by their own lunacy. There
are moments that make you think
you are watching the result of lock-
ing up the school remedial class for
ten years in the music room. No
natural light, just speed. This tour,
like the new record, features BBC
Jazz Vocalist Of The Year Liane
Carroll, with MC Wrek and Tony
Carroll taking other vocal duties
and any ranting opportunities. The
result is sometimes beautiful, as on
The Strangest Secret In The World,
and frequently chaotic and confus-
ing, as on Different Drum. However,
the atmosphere generated is insist-
ent, a lightning storm, transform-
ing the drum’n’bass sound into an
experience that flows up and down
as erratically as the umbrellas they
wave around. ‘Wired up’ doesn’t
even begin to describe it.

Oceansize are a band with noth-
ing to prove. They already have a
loyal fanbase, devotees of the rarer
kind, who have turned out in force
tonight. However, an eventful sum-
mer with several festival appearanc-
es, of a higher profile than they were
previously used to, added to the fact
that their new album Everyone Into
Position contains several potential
indie radio-friendly hits means this
could be their chance to break into
the bigger leagues. And don’t they
just know it.
Singer/guitarist Mike Vennart
flings himself about the stage with
reckless abandon, his ‘cooler-than-
thou’ haircut thrown in hitherto
unknown directions as he feels the
full force of his bands multi-layered
explosive force tearing through flesh
and concrete like a wrecking ball
cut loose from its chain: “I wanna
cut you to the bone” – Meredith.
The band tear through such a vari-
ety of musical genres - prog rock
through to hardcore via gospel - that
it sometimes becomes hard to find
a discernable pattern amongst the
noises. As the singer notes of their
wide ranging appeal - “This one’s for
the metalheads” - but beneath the
theatrics of his performance and the
bands sometimes seemingly ran-
dom mish-mash of styles, they seem
so confident in themselves that it
almost seems like they are asking
us to trust them on this one. What
really impresses about the band’s
performance tonight is their abil-
ity to never lose the crowds inter-
est. Sure, some of the older punters
standing at the back, enjoying the
refreshing air-con, over-priced pint
in hand, may take time during the
quieter moments of the show to
discuss how Oceansize are the best
thing since sliced bread, but those
of us here to appreciate the music
remain entranced throughout.
Love, joy, pain, fear, hope. These
are the emotions that the band and
the crowd experience as one, bound
together by the music, which as
much as I would like it not to be,
can’t help but feel slightly famil-
iar. Watching Mike wrestle with his
guitar behind his head as though
it were a venomous snake inches
away from striking, while enter-
taining enough, seems a little too
like the onstage antics of one (Sir)
Matt Bellamy. While he may not
have reached the Queen’s ears
yet, there is not doubt in mine that
Muse have been crucial in defin-
ing Oceansize’s sound, which comes
across as a more human and less
‘space opera’ Muse. This impression
is not helped one bit by the pres-
ence of one Dominic Howard, the
drummer with the aforementioned
space-rock gods, who hangs around
after the show willingly signing auto-
graphs and having his picture taken
with fans. Let’s hope he spreads
the word to Sir Bellamy about the
exciting new avenues down which
Oceansize have taken the familiar
Muse sound so that their currently-
in-development fourth LP can be all
the better for it.
Verbal communication by the band
is kept to a minimum (although
frontman Mike Vennart does invite
the crowd to come and get pissed
with them at a local boozer), but
this doesn’t seem to bother anyone
as the music speaks so personally
to everyone there. The band end
with finale to end all finales, build-
ing a song up for what seems like
an eternity until they are all on the
point of collapse, then each taking
a bow and leaving to a rapturous
applause one by one until finally all
that is left is a pulsating whine of
high pitched static. Upon leaving
the venue, and realising the whine is
still going – in my ears – we are left
with a feeling that tonight we wit-
nessed something oh-so-special, but
somehow indescribable, so I urge
to seek these musical masters out
for yourselves and discover the joys
which lie within.
