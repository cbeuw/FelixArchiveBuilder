A
pparently monkeys like
to throw snowballs and
bears enjoy toboggan-
ing. These were just a
couple of the stories that
Professor Brian J Ford used to try
to convince his audience that ani-
mals experience a range of feelings,
just like us. His talk, ‘Do Fish Fall in
Love?’, took place last Wednesday,
19 October, at the Dana Centre – an
informal forum for discussing sci-
ence without getting baffled by tech-
nical jargon. There was also the
added bonus of a drink and a meal.
Carrot and coriander soup was
swiftly followed by Prof Ford’s infor-
mal lecture. Drawing on his book
Sensitive Souls, Prof Ford used
examples of animal behaviour to
explain how we, humans, should
not set ourselves apart from other
animals on the basis of language,
consciousness or self-awareness.
Indeed, some animals and even
single-cell organisms were commu-
nicating long before we managed
so much as a grunt. The behav-
ioural adaptations that some spe-
cies demonstrate, such as crows
dropping walnuts onto concrete, or
blue tits opening milk bottles to get
at the reward inside, show that they
might not necessarily react purely
on instinct but are also capable of
cognitive thought processes. These
new skills are also passed between
individuals, showing an awareness
of fellow members and groups.
Prof Ford encouraged us to ques-
tion the anthropocentric view of life,
as many animals were here long
before us and have been thinking,
learning, communicating and, in the
case of amoebas, even flirting, long
before we had worked it out. So
perhaps we humans, with our over-
sized brains (or ‘cerebral cancer’
as Prof Ford charmingly put it),
should learn to show some humility.
However, it seems natural for us
to look for human characteristics
in nature – we only really have one
frame of reference. And Ford him-
self, by using a title like ‘Do Fish
Fall in Love?’, was clearly inviting
comparison and applying a ‘human’
construct, love, to fish.
Following a serving of lasagne, we
moved on to a question and answer
session, where the audience thor-
oughly tested Ford’s arguments.
Although we all seemed to agree
with his ideas and the motivation
behind them (expressing superior-
ity over a tobogganing bear would
probably have invited boos from
the audience), it became clear that
there was very little experimental
evidence behind Prof Ford’s asser-
tions. Call us old-fashioned, but isn’t
science based on interpretations of
experimental observation rather
than anecdotal references?
At times we veered off the subject
with talk of bird flu, robotic dogs,
the colour of egg yolks and a bizarre
diatribe against supermarkets,
which while unrelated was nonethe-
less interesting and entertaining.
Altogether, a thought-provoking and
enjoyable evening, as long as you
ordered the vegetarian option.
There’s a saying that it takes 21 days
to make or break a habit. However,
according to a study published in the
20 October edition of Nature, hab-
its may be gone but not forgotten.
Researchers at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) have
released data that suggests that
habits are hardwired into a specific
region of the brain. This wiring is
changed when habits are broken but
will re-emerge when something trig-
gers the old pattern of behavior.
“It is as though somehow the
brain retains a memory of the habit
context, and this pattern can be
triggered if the right habit cues
come back,” said Ann Graybiel, the
Walter A Rosenblith Professor of
Neuroscience in MIT’s Department
of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, in a
statement released by the MIT news
office. “This situation is familiar to
anyone who is trying to lose weight
or to control a well-engrained habit.
Just the sight of a piece of chocolate
cake can reset all those good inten-
tions.”
The basal ganglia is the region of
the brain linked to habits, as well as
addiction and procedural learning.
Researchers in Graybiel’s labora-
tory studied the neural outputs from
this region in rats.
In these experiments, rats were
put through a T-maze. At the end
of a long corridor, rats had to
decide whether to turn right or left
in response to auditory cues. The
correct choice led to a chocolate
reward.
During the process of trial-
and-error learning, researchers
observed that neurons were active
throughout the maze run, the rat’s
brain being on high alert because
anything might be important for
achieving a positive outcome. While
the rats learned which cues indi-
cated the correct arm of the maze
to take to find the chocolate, the
neurons in the basal ganglia were
being trained too.
Once the cues had been learned
thoroughly, the neurons attached
to the task only fired intensely at
the beginning and end of the maze.
In the rest of the maze, the rats
appeared to work on autopilot, their
neurons becoming quiet. It was also
observed that other ‘disinterested’
neurons were silent during the
maze run, seemingly in order not to
hinder the critical neural signals.
Researchers then removed the
reward, rendering the cues mean-
ingless. This change made every-
thing in the maze relevant again,
causing the neurons to revert to
high activity during the run. The
rats eventually stopped running the
maze because of the lack of reward,
breaking their habit and changing
the new habit signaling pattern in
their brain cells. However, as soon
as the reward was returned, the
learned neural pattern, with the
beginning and ending spikes, reap-
peared.
Graybiel speculates that the spikes
in neural activity at the beginning
and end of the maze reflect the
nature of routine behavior. Once we
get started, like the rats, we run
on autopilot until we stop. Specific
neurological disorders also seem to
be linked to these spikes in neu-
ral activity in the basal ganglia.
Parkinson’s patients, for example,
have difficulty starting to walk, and
people with obsessive-compulsive
disorder have problems stopping an
incessant activity.
“We are hopeful that this may
be a key to understanding how
to treat bad habits like addiction,
and also how to encourage good
habits that benefit health and hap-
piness,” Graybiel said. “We think
that these patterns will also help
researchers understand the funda-
mental problems in disorders such
as Parkinson’s disease, OCD and
Tourette syndrome.”
