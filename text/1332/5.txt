hideous to contemplate. Yet little
more can be done, other than a ruth-
less policy of destroying any fowl
deemed to be infected. Remember
the foot-and-mouth epidemic? We
could also follow the example of the
Netherlands and keep our poultry
indoors. This could be seen as an
overreaction at this stage, but it is
something, which should be consid-
ered if Britain faced a more immi-
nent risk of contamination.
H5N1 will be a pandemic which
spreads rapidly across the world.
Improved transportation of humans,
not to mention the prodigious dis-
tances travelled by migrating birds,
will scatter the virus across the
world. A human infected in London
could be in New York by the time
they started developing the first
symptoms.
In many ways, though, the fact
that H5N1 has now reached Europe
does little to increase the risk to the
British people. The virus still needs
to mutate, and this is more likely to
happen in the unsanitary conditions
of poverty-stricken South-East Asia,
where humans and poultry share a
roof and are in a more direct con-
tact. It is true that the more people
that are exposed to H5N1, the more
favourable the circumstances would
be for it to mutate and spread; yet
the risk is lower in Europe. This is
no reason to be complacent; rather,
we should see European H5N1 as
a herald of what might come, and
strive to be prepared for the storm
when it breaks.

A
lready in October, out-
breaks of a strain of influ-
enza in migratory and
farmed birds have sent
shock waves through
Europe. The H5N1 flu viral strain
from South-East Asia, which has
killed over sixty people since the
first cases in 2004, has now reached
the borders of Europe.
The passage of the disease from
its South-East Asian stronghold has
been charted by outbreaks in Russia
and Kazakhstan and, most recently,
in a poultry farm in Balikesir, Turkey,
on 1 October. A further outbreak in
the Danube wetlands in Romania
has also turned out to be a case of
the H5N1 strain. In both cases, all
birds deemed to have been exposed
to the virus were destroyed. Now
Greece has become the first EU
nation to confirm an outbreak of
bird flu, although it is not yet clear
whether it is of the deadly strain.
Yet why the hysteria? This seem-
ingly innocuous influenza virus has
taken the world by metaphorical
storm. It’s big news in the Far East:
in Thailand’s daily Bangkok Post
a day without a story on bird flu
is exceptional. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) is desperately
trying to investigate the potential
this virus has for causing a global
pandemic. The Netherlands, a coun-
try thousands of miles from the near-
est bird flu outbreak, has ordered all
poultry to be kept indoors to avoid
potential contact with infected wild-
fowl. All over the world scientists are
frantically trying to create a vaccine
and understand the organism itself.
A lot of people are very worried.
Essentially, the worry is caused by
the perceived ease with which the
H5N1 virus could mutate into some-
thing far more dangerous. The sixty
or so people who have already died
of the virus had direct, prolonged
contact with infected birds, and the
virus could have been transmitted
from the birds to the victim through
saliva, nasal secretions and faeces.
Once successfully within a human
body, it is deadly – about half of
those infected die. While the virus
can currently only be contracted
from contact with birds, it is thought
that it could mutate into a form that
could easily transmit from human
to human. Once this happens, it
could spread like wildfire through
the human population.
Much of the hypotheses surround-
ing bird flu have been vindicated
by recent research, which has res-
urrected the notorious Spanish flu
virus, which killed 40 million peo-
ple in 1918-19. It has been shown
that the Spanish flu was a form
of avian flu similar to the H5N1
strain, which mutated in order to
adapt to the conditions within the
human system. What set the 1918
strain apart from the 1957 and 1968
strains, which both killed several
million people worldwide, is that the
1918 strain was a direct adaptation
of avian flu to be virulent in humans,
whereas the others combined with
existing human virus strains. The
H5N1 virus appears to be adapt-
ing to be lethal in humans without
having to combine like the 1957 and
1968 strains, following the legacy of
Spanish flu.
The similaritiy between the evolu-
tion of H5N1 and Spanish flu lies
in the mutations of the three-gene
sequencing for RNA-polymerase,
a three-protein complex. This was
the key for the Spanish flu’s mur-
derous success – it mimicked the
RNA-polymerase structure found
in other human influenza viruses.
H5N1 hasn’t so far exhibited muta-
tions that would make its RNA-
polymerase structurally similar to
the Spanish flu one, but it is showing
some of them in some cases.
When the pandemic arrives – and
the general consensus is that it is
not if, but when the virus mutates
to be capable of human to human
transmission – what defences will
we have? The virus’s relentless
westward surge has the govern-
ment pulling out all the stops in an
effort to be prepared for the numer-
ous expected mortalities. Sir Liam
Donaldson, the chief medical officer,
has estimated 50,000 fatalities in the
UK. Other, more inflated estimates,
predict as many as three quarters
of a million. Stockpiling of antiviral
drugs, such as Tamiflu, has begun.
The Department of Health has pub-
licised plans to buy 120 million vac-
cines against the virus, enough to
protect the entire population.
This has raised eyebrows, how-
ever, as no such vaccine exists yet.
Scientists around the world have
been working on the vaccine for
some time without the major break-
through so desperately craved.
One problem is that the structure
of the H5N1 virus, which causes
the pandemic, cannot be accurately
forecasted. We cannot say precisely
what its defining genetic attributes
are. A vaccine against a generic
strain of H5N1 would not prevent
infection and may have limited
capabilities to counter the effects.
Even the antiviral drugs are scarce,
due to the difficult manufacturing
processes. A pandemic that hit this
winter would be a nightmare too

“Yet why the hysteria?
This seemingly
innocuous virus has
taken the world by
metaphorical storm.”
“A human infected in
London could be in
New York by the time
they started developing
the first symptoms.”
Since the outbreak in South-East Asia in 2004, which caused a mass cull of birds in China, the H5N1 strain
of avian flu has killed over sixty people. Bird flu has reached the borders of Europe this month with possible
cases being reported in Turkey, Romania and Greece. It is not yet clear whether it is of the deadly strain.
“Venus Express” space
probe launch delayed
The launch of the European
Space Agency’s “Venus
Express” spacecraft has been
delayed after technicians
discovered contamination in
the Russian-made launcher.
Europe’s first mission to Venus
was scheduled for Wednesday
but will be delayed for several
days while tests are carried out
on the Soyuz-Fregat launcher.
Fourth bird flu victim in
Indonesia, disease spreads
Indonesia confirmed on
Tuesday a fourth person in the
country had succumbed to bird
flu while China said hundreds
of farm geese had died, the lat-
est outbreak of a disease that
seems to defy efforts to halt
its spread. The deadly H5N1
virus first surfaced in Asia
but appears to be spreading
quickly to the West. Russia
confirmed more bird flu cases
in poultry on Monday, further
raising fears the disease could
spread across Europe on the
wings of migratory birds.
Scientists draft blueprint to
protect world oceans
Scientists are mapping out a
plan for a network of marine
parks to save the world’s
oceans from fish stock deple-
tion and growing pollution.
Achim Steiner, director-gen-
eral of the World Conservation
Union, said a conservation plan
for the unregulated high seas
would be produced by 2008.
