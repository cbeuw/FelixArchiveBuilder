The exhibition of work spanning the
entire career of Jeff Wall (b. 1946,
Canada) reinforces the role he has
played in establishing photography
as a contemporary art form.
When Wall first started experi-
menting with photography, he
wished to avoid the obvious truth-
telling dimension of this medium
and use technology that had not
been previously exploited. He was
inspired by brightly illuminated bill-
boards similar to those found at bus
shelters and started using colour
transparencies mounted in wall-
hung light boxes. These are often
scaled to life size so it feels like you
are able to step inside the frame and
stand on the fringes of the action,
being physically and almost voyeur-
istically involved in the images.
Adding to his originality as a pho-
tographer, spontaneity does not
interest Wall. If he sees an image he
wishes to capture, instead of taking
a photograph there and then, he
recreates the moment in his studio
using amateur actors, costumes and
digital technology. Some of these
staged compositions have taken
more than a year to perfect and one
of his most well known pictures,
A Sudden Gust of Wind (1993), is
composed of more than 100 photo-
graphs, blurring the line between
document and fabrication. He has
described his own work as being
either ‘cinematographic’ or ‘docu-
mentary,’ using techniques normally
associated with film production.
The multiple layers and elaborate
detail of his pictures add depth,
encouraging the viewer to closely
inspect an image thus allowing hid-
den elements to reveal themselves.
For example, at first glance there
seems only to be one person in Forest
(2001), but as you look between the
branches it is possible to make out
the figure of a man. There are also
shadowy corners that recede into
the background and half-open doors
that let the viewer use their imagi-
nation to explore what is beyond.
Despite his images being manipu-
lated snapshots, they appear realis-
tic. Wall wished to create characters
that do not embody his point of
view, but are based on situations
he has witnessed and represent

Jeﬀ Wall: Art imitates life
people of modern life. He conveys
social observations, for example, in
Mimic (1982) where the simple rac-
ist gesture reveals the meaning of
the photograph, but he tries to avoid
a moralistic attitude. Many of his
everyday life pictures seem bleak,
such as the street scenes and his
panoramic landscapes of suburbia,
where he has used locations around
Vancouver that he knows well.
My personal favourites include
Dead Troops Talk (1992), a purely
imaginary vision where soldiers
that have been killed in the battle-
field engage in conversation, each
responding differently to their death.
The Flooded Grave (1998 – 2000)
depicts a cemetery and a close-up
of sea-life submerged in an open
grave, the brightly coloured starfish
and anemones a stark contrast to
what you expect to see in such a
place. His most recent work, A view
from an apartment (2004 – 2005)
is a domestic scene that was set
in an apartment especially rented
for the purpose, where one of the
women in the picture was asked to
furnish it and live in it as if it were
her own. The scene is heightened
through its meticulous composition
and the documentary material is
transformed to that of a cinemato-
graphic image, creating an interface
between truth and fiction.
All photography contains an ele-
ment of reportage, but Wall has
developed this and uses references
to film, literature and the history of
art. His elaborate, staged creations
as well as his more traditional pho-
tographic projects deserve recogni-
tion and make him one of the most
influential artists working today.

The Donmar Warehouse, famous for
its outstanding and daring produc-
tions, has moved its show Mary
Stuart into the West End. People
have been queuing around the block
at its 250-seater theatre in Covent
Garden to get tickets, and critics
have been raving. So is it really that
great? Or is it all just hype? I went
along to find out.
Mary Stuart is an 18th century
play by Fredrich Schiller, and was
revived for the Donmar by Peter
Oswald. Schiller’s portrayal of the
extraordinary relationship between
Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth
I is not entirely historically accu-
rate, but it is a fascinating and com-
pelling story of power, passion, faith
and honour.
Centring on Mary, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth’s lover Leicester and the
fictional English noble, Mortimer,
who is sympathetic to Mary, the play
charts Mary’s last few days locked
up in prison. The excellent Janet
McTeer shows us her frivolous,
emotional side in the company of
her nurse, and her strong and noble
front to her enemies, the English.
Elizabeth, played by the equally
brilliant Harriet Walter, holds the
power to decide whether Mary
lives or dies. However, as the play
progresses and Elizabeth’s advisors
pull her harder and harder in each
direction, she displays less and less
the strength of character that the
situation demands of a queen and
which is so amply shown by Mary. At
their single meeting in the gardens
of Mary’s prison, Elizabeth attempts
to crush her and make her humble,
but she is thwarted by Mary’s high-
ly emotive and articulate speech.
Elizabeth simply cannot match the
passion of the Scot, who now has
nothing left to lose. At the end of
the play it is Mary, not Elizabeth,
who is able to overcome the schem-
ing Leicester and rise up to what is
asked of her. Elizabeth is left alone,
trusting no one and ashamed by her
actions.
The production is flawless. Largely
minimalist in style, it uses colour,
costume and effects only when
they produce the most impressive
effects. Tudor dresses for the two
women highlight their stark con-
trast in the eyes of the world with
the sharp-suited men who surround
and advise them. They merge into
the background, a grey wall of advi-
sors for the two queens, with only
Leicester wearing any distinguish-
able colour..
This is theatre at its best. It will
make you laugh, it will make you
think, it will involve you and enlight-
en you. Go and see it.
“Why does the
sight of her make
me ashamed?”
