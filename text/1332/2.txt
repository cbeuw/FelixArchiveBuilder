“There were beautiful landscape
shots of Africa and it should come
as no surprise that the acting was
superb. After all, Ralph Fiennes and
Rachel Weisz do have the experi-
ence to carry this film to the Oscars.
Nevertheless, good acting or other-
wise, it doesn’t save the plot cliché.
The days when we were inclined to
believe in ‘X-Files’ conspiracy theo-
ries are over. What can I say except-
better luck next time!”

The Tanaka building and the
Mechanical Engineering Foyer were
bustling with engineering students
on Wednesday 19 October, when the
annual Engineering Careers Fair
was held. The fair was organised by
the City and Guilds College Union’s
Internship Centre together with the
Careers Advisory Service. The aim
was to give engineering undergrad-
uates a greater exposure to engi-
neering companies, and give them
the opportunity to discuss possible
career options.
Thirty companies, including Arup,
Network Rail, Procter & Gamble,
Rolls Royce, Shell and BP
, attend-
ed the fair and many stands were
manned by alumni of the College.
Over 1500 students from the various
engineering departments came to
speak to the company representa-
tives, and there was a general con-
sensus amongst the students that
it was fantastic to have an “engi-
neering-only” event, where financial
institutions weren’t dominant.
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,
and the Principal of the Faculty of
Engineering, Prof. Julia King, were
also in attendance for part of the
afternoon.
Professor Julia King said, “We
think the careers fair will be a great
success and we hope it will encour-
age lots of our students to consider
careers in engineering when they
leave Imperial. Our graduates are
much in demand. So many com-
panies wanted to take part in this
Careers Fair that we have had to put
some on a waiting list.
“We’re really pleased to see some
of our alumni on the stands. It gives
the current students a glimpse of
the exciting future ahead of them
when they see what our previous
students have gone on to do” she
added.
If you enjoyed attending the fair
and are interested in helping with
the organisation next year, please

take the appropiate action including
escourting people off-site”.
Problems have arisen at other uni-
versities. The Guardian reported
that at Middlesex University the
president of the Student Union was
suspended for refusing to cancel a
debate he had previously organised
with Hizb ut-Tahrir. Furthermore,
six students at Lancaster University
faced up to 3 months in jail after
being prosecuted for demonstrating
on their campus. They interrupt-
ing a speech by Lord Sainsbury,
the Science Minister, and had to be
removed by university staff.
Boris Johnson, editor of The
Spectator, once wrote an article
for The Telegraph about a reli-
gious confrontation between the
Anglo-Catholics and the evangelical
Protestants that promised to explo-
sive. Nothing much happened in the
endbuthereceivedmanycomplaints
about his article (perhaps due to the
use of some slightly inconsiderate
language). However, retrospectively
he says, “The remarkable thing is
not how much fuss they made, but
how little, especially if you think
what we have come to expect from
some Muslims. I have in mind not
just the murders of Pim Fortuyn and
Theo van Gogh, but the trembling
refusal of a noted Koranic scholar to
write an article for The Spectator.”
He then quoted him as saying, “You
don’t understand. These people will
kill me if I say what I really think. I
mean kill me.”
What politicians argue makes
Islam so politically and socially haz-
ardous is that some Muslims react
to an insult to Islam and its follow-
ers with a very deep personal sense
of indignation. This stimulates
young men to become disenchant-
ed with British society and politics.
This can further result in a minority
of cases becoming extremists and
even suicide bombers. Due to this
minority, western governments, as
Mr Johnson puts it, “are now so des-
perately using new laws to decide
what Muslims can say about their
own religion.”
Last Friday, 21 October, patrons of
the almost legendary Sandwich Shop
on Gloucester Road were treated to
an unusual sight as a mock funeral
procession, complete with three
hearses and a New Orleans Jazz
Band, walked by. Organized by the
Forum of Private Business (FPB), it
was held in protest to the extension
of the congestion charging zone, due
to happen in February 2007.
The ‘mourners’ staged the event in
a bid to demonstrate the anticipated
‘death’ of their trade, particularly
as the charge was raised from £5
to £8 per day this July. Despite the
event being well publicized, it wasn’t
particularly well attended, with an
approximate 1:1 ratio of press and
police to protestors, presumably
because, rightly or wrongly, there is
little sympathy for the plight of the
richest borough in London.
FPB chief Nick Goulding said,
“visitors and shoppers need to be
encouraged to come into London”
and called on the mayor to suspend
the congestion charge until January.
Ken Livingstone has yet to respond.
Local residents associations and
politicians are concerned that the
congestion charge is “a new poll
tax” and that it would “kill local
business”.
The protest started with a mock
funeral parade up the Gloucester
Road. After dismounting at the top
of Gloucester Road, local represent-
atives made speeches to the present
crowd, starting off with the presi-
dent of the National Society, Alan
Smith, denouncing the new charge
on hearses as “no more than a tax
on death and grief”, and he was
here to “represent local businesses
that will be affected by the conges-
tion charge extension“.
Local politicians also gave
speeches, with one local councillor
claiming that “out of 60,000 resi-
dents questioned…70% or residents
and 80% of businesses opposed the
extension”. Newly elected MP for
Hammersmith and Fulham, Greg
Hands, stated that his borough was
fully behind the campaign, “We
would be worse affected, as our
borough would get the displaced
traffic…it would be a catastrophe”.
Kensington and Chelsea MP Sir
Malcom Rifkin was also planning
to speak but was absent due to the
vote for the Conservative leader
that day.
The crowd were in a frenzied
mood, with constant chanting of
“Ken out!” after every speech. One
protester, speaking to Felix, said “Is
this a man fit to be Mayor of London
with his ‘Alice in Wonderland’ poli-
cies?”
The Mayor announced the exten-
sion of the London Congestion
Charge last month, saying that it
“will bring considerable benefits to
this area of London”.
