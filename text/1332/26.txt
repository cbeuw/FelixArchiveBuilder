behind

The day began with something of
an exodus to Chislehurst. Frodo
Baggins himself could not have
imagined a dirtier trek, to a more
barren wasteland, where lay in
wait a hoard of marauding minions,
yearning for your dark ring. And
it was with the same unease felt
by Wayne Rooney’s grandma, and
through previous encounters of the
absurd kind that compelled captain
Andrea to deploy the diamond for-
mation.
“The game grew tens-
er than Jordan’s bra
strap”
The match began crisply with both
sides sharing possession until when
10 minutes in, QM took the lead
through a goal as dubious as they all
are when scored against us. A throw-
in, played back to keeper Andriy, led
to confusion when he handled the
ball, gifting QM with a free kick in
our box. The quickly taken set piece
was swiftly converted, but it was
through their premature climax that
we were left unsatisfied, and like a
non-sixth team player’s girlfriend,
got us digging deep inside ourselves
to grind out the result. As the pres-
sure mounted exponentially against
them, our midfield trio of Hamish,
Ben and Yong began working the
midfield like beer working a stu-
dent’s bank account.
“Skeen delivered the
ball into the G-spot”
The second half saw the introduc-
tion of Jack “and his beanstalk”
Yip and Choy “the Duracell Bunny”
Yong, who was eager to maintain
his record of having covered more
grass than Rizla. Our first goal
came via a corner minutes from the
restart. James “and his giant peach-
es” Skeen delivered the ball into
the G-spot allowing McNelly “the
elephant dater” to rise like a binge
drinker’s stomach content to glance
the ball inside the far post. With the
score line level, the game grew tens-
er than Jordan’s bra strap, but the
momentum remained one sided. Our
second came in similar fashion when
keen Mr. Skeen whipped in another
cross for the hustling Hasted to swoop
like a vulture on a Redbull overdose
to nod the ball home and double our
lead.
Despite our obvious aerial prow-
ess from corners, their defensive
approach changed little. Our abuse
of their naivety would have made MJ
proud as James delivered the ball
from the corner flag towards the lurk-
ing McNelly. The keeper’s attempts
to claim the ball lead to his ‘packet-
of-crisps-like’ hands (probably ‘Skips’
since they seemed to melt in the goal
mouth) spilling the ball. It eventu-
ally fell to the head of the Mook, who
nonchalantly lofted the ball over the
stranded defence to seal the victory.
QM rallied on in the closing stages
of the game but like a pair of silicon
enhanced shoulder boulders, our cen-
tre backs, Ricky and Tom, stood firm.
At times our movement was fluid,
our passing crisp, our flair so down
right sexy, ours weren’t the only long
balls climbing skyward. Such was our
pornographic display that QM left the
pitch with precious little Viagra to last
them their communal showers. All in
all, an encouraging team perform-
ance.

We arrived in lovely Hertfordshire
to find out that our forward fresh-
er had got stuck......in London,
Finsbury Park. Great!! Of course
somebody had to go and pick her
up, so off went our fly half and
scrum half... wait a sec aren’t they
quite important players? Who
allowed them to leave? After arriv-
ing at the bus depot and realising
that this wasn’t the bus stop they
found themselves panicking as
kick off was now ten minutes away.
After a few detours they eventually
managed to find the fresher.
Scrum half and fly half reas-
sured the fresher after her apolo-
gies, that the game wouldn’t start
without these two essentially
important players. However noth-
ing could be further from the truth.
A panicking Vets team and referee
who was worrying about it getting
dark had somehow managed to
persuade the Wye College team to
start the match with only 12 play-
ers. The missing players arrived to
find a rather nasty scene greeting
them , a 6 v 8 player scrum. This
made us all later question in the
pub whether the rules were less
like actual rules and more like
guidelines?
Anyway, after all the panicking
and rather sketchy beginning the 80
minutes of Rugby that followed was
enjoyed by all our players. Although
we never managed to break through
there tough line of defense to score
a try we battled hard and never
gave up. Some tough performances
were given by all, especially by the
late arriving scrum half, Suzanne
Horn, who kept the team together
in a hard first match of the season,
as well as putting some awesome
tackles in and making some fantas-
tic decisions. She was given Woman
of the match by her own team. Lucy
Le Cocq was given Woman of the
Match by the Vets because of her
amazing ability to accelerate away
from the opposition with the ball
and her ducking skills. We took four
new freshers with us, of which three
played. They all did a fantastic job
after attending only three practices
and it became apparent that they
would become important dedicated
members of the team. Mary and
Hetty, both members of the Scrum
found themselves taking on the
Vets and each other as they fell
over our try line leaving our two
members slightly dazed after hit-
ting eachs heads and sadly not the
opposition, whilst the rest our team
stood around chatting. It is felt that
no more detail is needed on the
match as we embarrassingly lost
83-0 despite of all our valiant efforts
but we may yet appeal due to the
unfairness at the beginning of the
match.
