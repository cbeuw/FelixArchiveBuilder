Persons trying to secure UK stu-
dents’ signatures, in protest against
the introduction of new anti-terror
laws, have been shown to be linked
to an extremist organisation.
An undercover reporter from The
Times infiltrated into the group
‘Stop Islamaphobia’, posing as a
post graduate at UCL, to discover
the misleading name is in fact part
of Hizb ut-Tahrir, one of the Islamist
parties facing a ban under terrorist
laws.
Persons wearing T-shirts with the
words and the palm of a hand
held in the stop position where seen
throughout campus during Frshers
Fayre, October 4. They were pre-
dominately seen in the vicinity of the
zebra crossing on Prince Consort
Road between the main College
campus and the Union. Students
were asked to sign a petition against
the introduction of the new anti-ter-
ror laws and were asked to sign-up
to the ‘Stop Islamaphobia’ mailing
list.

Last Friday, 21 October, Islamic
prayers were once again held on
Queens Lawn. In last week’s Felix,
1331, we reported how Muslim stu-
dents were forced to pray outside
as there is no available space on
campus.
Imperial College state that as a
secular institution they will not pro-
vide space for communal worship.
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, Deputy
Rector, told Felix that, “The College
position remains... we have made
it quite clear the College does not
support congregated worship”.
However he did state that, “the
Islamic Society can book space like
any other club and society, but there
will be no creation of space... no ear-
marking of space”.
The only suitable space in College
is the Great Hall, which was booked
out last Friday for a rehearsal of
the graduation ceremony that took
place in the Royal Albert Hall yes-
terday. Felix received claims that
the College deliberately booked
the Great Hall at this time to pre-
vent the Islamic Society using it for
prayer. Upon investigation Felix has
been shown evidence to refute this
claims the Great Hall was booked
months in advance.
Andrew Wilson, College Chaplain
told Felix, “Friday prayer is clearly a
vital element of the faith of Muslims
and as a Christian I can respect that.
The Chaplaincy explored the pos-
sibility of the Islamic Society using
large meeting rooms owned by St
Augustine’s Church (unfortunately
this wasn’t possible). Imperial is
an academic community made up
of many different view, beliefs and
faiths. I hope that a practical solu-
tion can be found”.
Next week the Great Hall is booked
out for an external event, so Prayers
maybe held on Queen’s Lawn for
the third week running. The Deputy
Rector has confirm that once built
the new sports centre will not be
available for Friday Prayers.

IC Virgins: An Apology
In issue 1328 (the first of term),
we wrote:
‘...you could always try out for the
ironically named IC Virgins. Just
be sure to bring your boots, shorts,
and diaphragm ... Promiscuity and
STDs are the key qualifications for
any budding Virgin ... as any guy
will tell you, there’s nothing more
attractive than a girl who can ...
give you the worst case of crabs of
your short young life. They’re femi-
ninity personified.’
The girls weren’t best pleased
with this. Coffee Break would like to
make it clear that we’ve got no beef
with the Virgins. They’re lovely
girls who’re nothing like we sug-
gested.
Roastings, chlamydia and a sense
of humour have no place on this
team. They’re clean cut ladies who
take their sport seriously, and cer-
tainly don’t revel in their reputation
as easy lays for the boys team.
Should you be a rugby-loving
laydee, and struggling to decide
what club to join, we can recommend
the Virgins. Again, sorry girls.

Under the anti-racist name ‘Stop Islamophobia’ an Islamist group attempted
to recruit students at Freshers Fayre
Some people weren’t all they seemed at this year’s Freshers Fayre
Rupert Neate
Editor
Daniela de Angel claiming Bush and Blair are creat-
ing an alarmist “politics of fear” dis-
crediting the entire Muslim commu-
nity so they can fight their war with-
out question. ‘Radicals, subversives,
conspiracies, infiltration, recruit-
ment, treason, an enemy within,
betrayal, ideologies, terror, torture,
spying, deportation, protecting our
way of life’ are all words used by
‘Stop Islamophobia’, describing how
the government is swaying society
to portray the Islamic way of life.
These terms were used during the
Cold War Communist persecutions
in America, in the McCarthy period.
An undercover investigator from
The Times established that stu-
dents are being recruited under
the deceptive and politically cor-
rect name ‘Stop Islamophobia’.
Allegedly, the group campaigns
to, “fight anti-Muslim prejudice in
the wake of London’s bombings”,
asking students to sign a petition
against anti-terrorist legislations.
The undercover reporter showed
interest in the group and was sub-
sequently introduced to members of
Hizb ut-Tahrir.
Hassan Choudhury, national co-
ordinator of Stop Islamophobia,
denied links with Hizb ut-Tahir.
However according to The Times,
Thaqib Razaq, an active mem-
ber, claims to have joined Hizb ut-
Tahrir with Choudhury. In one of
the meetings Razaq stated Stop
Islamophobia, “is set up by us, but
we don’t actually push it like that,
the moment they link us with Hizb
ut-Tahrir they’ll bring the whole
campaign down.” The reporter was
told the party method demanded
complete dislocation from democ-
racy and British secular values, but
is non violent. However, The Times
states that one member said suicide
bombers in Israel would go “straight
to heaven”.
Earlier this year, Professor
Anthony Glees from Brunel
University released a report on
Colleges being “breeding grounds
for extremists”. He affirms extrem-
ist parties have “issued a number
of anti-Semitic statements, anti-
Hindu, anti-Sikh, homophobic, anti-
feminist, and resentful of Western
influence on Islam”. Soon after the
statement the NUS appealed to stu-
dent unions to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir
from campuses, accusing the party
of “supporting terrorism and pub-
lishing material which incites racial
hatred”.
Despite the appeal from NUS,
Imperial College Union (ICU) does
not have any specific ban on mem-
bers of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Samenna
Misbahuddin, President of ICU,
said, “The Union does not support
in any way nor allow any group to
incite hatred on any group of people.
The Union has an equal opportuni-
ties policy which clearly upholds
this, and this policy will be enforced.
It is important that at all times we
students unite in ensuring that any
incitement of hatred is not tolerated
on our campuses”.
Imperial College expressed con-
cern when informed, by Felix, of
the presence of this group on cam-
pus. Deputy Rector, Sir Leszek
Borysiewicz, told Felix; “every-
one at Imperial is responsible for
security. If anyone has any suspi-
cions of unauthorised persons they
should contact security, who will
