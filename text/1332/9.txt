ALBUM REVIEWS
Allegedly, Tennessee’s long-haired
country rockers My Morning Jacket
have gone weird. This is not strictly
true, but they have certainly veered
away from their standard, tried and
tested song writing method.
MMJ’s previous three albums
have been full of a mixture of sparse
and haunting songs, and a few full
blown stompin’ rock outs, full of gui-
tar solo’s and whatnot. Believe me,
it’s better than it sounds, especially
with front man Jim James’ plaintive
voice, always wreathed in reverb
(they used to record in corn silos!).
From the moment you pop simply
monikered Z in your hi-fi you can
tell that something has changed.
Opener Wordless Chorus starts with
throbbing bass synth, short sharp
mellow organ stabs and a simple
drum pattern. As the song breaks
into its, um, wordless chorus you
think you are back to the familiar,
with aahs and oohs over heavy cym-
bals, but underneath it clicks and
warbles away oddly. And at the end
it mimics Prince, as Jim James tries
goes all falsetto and white-man funk
on us! Experi-mental.
What A Wonderful Man and Lay
Low are extensions on their clas-
sic formula, being upbeat and fun,
with the tune carried by a guitar
riff and bright piano. As per usual
with the band the drums sound like
they were recorded in a big hollow
room (because they probably were),
and the vocals echo around for a
second after Jim stops singing. This
is pretty much where the comfort
zone ends.
Gideon could be Mercury Rev, and
if there was one band MMJ never
used to sound like it was Mercury
Rev. But they pull it off and it sounds
very impressive, making it one of the
standout tracks from Z. It’s proving
hard to describe Off The Record,
so bare with me. The opening riff
is stolen from Hawaii Five-Oh, the
verse is a bit like snotty SoCal punk
slowed down until it’s very, very
slow, and the chorus is a little reg-
gae, as Jim sings “Off da rekkid, off
da rekkid” in an oddly childish voice.
And at the end it sounds like Zero 7.
Seriously.
Into The Woods is in stilted waltz-
time, like a fairground ride. There
are lyrics about kittens on fire and
babies in blenders. Children giggle
in the background, and things pop
and whistle around your head. As
it builds it sounds like they have
employed a drunk one-man-band
on percussion, and sloppily played
Theremin scoots along merrily,
before they are hi-jacked by finger-
picking gypsies.
As the album closes on the 8
minute Dondante, Mr James tests
his falsetto again, as well as a good
scream as they break into one of
their trademark huge prog-country
freak outs. While Z is certainly not
weird by some peoples standards, it
marks a startling evolution in sound
for the band. A brave and bold album
for which My Morning Jacket should
be applauded.
James Millen
Having been branded with the ‘pop-
ular in America’ label and securing
the opening slot on the Other stage
at Glastonbury, things are currently
looking rather rosy for the Dead 60s.
Having said that, they were on tour
with the Bravery in the US, who
found out the hard way how fickle
fame can be, and they didn’t actually
get to perform at Glastonbury, due
to the stage being struck by light-
ning during the torrential down-
pours prior to their set.
Riot Radio was released as
a single a week prior to the self-
titled album; however it has had
months of extensive radio play and
has been filling indie dance floors
for months, making the Dead 60s a
house-hold name within the NME
crowd. Hailing from Liverpool, the
Dead 60s are refreshingly different
from the Coral/Zutons clones that
you expect to come out of the city
and their album was one of the most
promising and anticipated of the
summer.
The album wisely starts with Riot
Radio, and due to putting such a
strong track first, you can’t help but
expect more of the good stuff to fol-
low. The fast and furious A Different
Age will undoubtedly continue the
mainstream success of the Dead 60s
with the heavy bassline and catchy
vocals making you nod your head
and dance in your seat without you
even noticing. The rest of the album
is startlingly unimpressive. The
album has strong reggae influences,
giving it a chilled, mellow feel, which
unfortunately, I found quite bland.
Ghost-Faced Killer stands out in
that its ska-punk nature is strikingly
similar to Madness, however unlike
Madness the repetitively results in
its skankability plummeting sharply.
The latter half of this album
appears to be an extended jamming/
experimental studio session. Many
of the songs are amazingly similar to
Hard-Fi, and you would be forgiven
for thinking that that was the band
you were listening to. Due to the
spouting of opinionated, semi-politi-
cal based babble, Hard-Fi somehow
managed to slip through the net that
filters the good from the rubbish and
achieve mainstream success, whilst
being labelled the voice of the youth
of Britain today. The Dead 60s have
no such label, and as a result, have
to depend on the strength of their
songs alone.
This album has no continuity,
resulting in the feeling that this is
a band who doesn’t know who they
are yet and are still experiment-
ing in order to discover their iden-
tity. Perhaps like Hard-Fi, they’ll
get lucky, however a couple of good
songs is unlikely to compensate for
this, a collection of dull drivel.

Having released a selection of solo
material on Rough Trade Records,
Jeffrey Lewis decided to team up
with his brother to form the Jack
& Jeffrey Lewis ‘band.’ Having
toured extensively around Europe
and America, on both headline
tours and bills shared with bands
such as British Sea Power, Radio 4,
Cornershop and the Fiery Furnaces,
Jack & Jeffrey Lewis are hoping to
reach a wider audience with City &
Eastern Songs.
Brought up in New York listening
to both folk and punk, it is no sur-
prise that their music encompasses
a wide variety of genres, with seem-
ingly no connection in style from
one song to the next, apart from
Jeffrey Lewis’s distinctive croaky
voice. The songs on City & Eastern
Songs take you on an emotional
journey through Lewis’s life and
experiences, feeling so intimate and
personal that you want to carry on
listening and find out more.
Don’t Be Upset is a heart-wrench-
ing, tear-jerking folky tale of loving
someone so much that you just want
them to feel better, and whatever is
upsetting them to just go away. This
song will make anyone who is in love
grateful that they are, and anyone
who isn’t wish that they were, simply
so that somebody was there to make
everything better for them.
Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror
deals with the self-doubt and insecu-
rities that Lewis feels with regards
to his own artistic ability. This tells a
story about how an encounter with
somebody unexpected can lead you
to questioning whether what you are
doing is worth it, and looking back
at your achievements and asking
whether they are as credible as you
would have liked.
Other stand-out tracks on this
album are the reflective Anxiety
Attack, punk-driven They Always
Knew and the escapist and bizarre
Time Machine, a reflection on
Jeffrey’s alternative creative outlet
as a comic artist and author. This is
an album that everybody can relate
to, dealing with the trials and tribu-
lations of life, drawing you in more
and more with every listen; a must
for anybody, which is everybody, that
has felt any element of self-doubt
and worthlessness during their life.
Great stuff.

Beards, bad reggae, and anti-folk
My Morning Jacket branch out, The Dead 60s prove worthless, and the Lewis brothers rock
My Morning Jacket - all real men have beards.
Jack & Jeffrey Lewis - pretty boys they ain’t.
