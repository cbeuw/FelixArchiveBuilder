Well thanks for all your votes. Over
the past few weeks we’ve received
literally tens votes, and spent far too
much time counting them.
Unfortunately, all this time has
been wasted, as the vote finished
with a dead heat.
So, to make things fair we’re run-
ning the competition for another few
days. You’ve got until next monday
to choose between The Hoff and
Optimus Prime. Good Luck.
