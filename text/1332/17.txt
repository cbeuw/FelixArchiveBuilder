From Marks and Spencer to Ralph Lauren, everyone’s in the pink
Dolly Delaney

I started working at Marks and
Spencer when I was 16 and left for
university 3 years later, returning
once again this summer to earn
more money. So naturally I was a dab
hand at fitting bras, talking to the
elderly and date rotating. Over the
past few years M&S have been going
breast cancer mad, with various pink
items in the lingerie department,
selling pink pins at every till point
and doing sponsored walks. This
Saturday sees the staff at Brighton’s
M&S doing a sponsored walk along
the seafront, which will hopefully
raise £2000 for Breakthrough Breast
Cancer. October is Breast Cancer
Awareness Month and many can-
cer charities have seen their profile
increase dramatically since Kylie
announced she was suffering from
breast cancer. Apparently she has
been cheering herself up by mimick-
ing Catherine Tate’s famous catch-
phrase, saying “I have cancer-am I
bovvered?”
I was lucky enough to see Kylie at
Earl’s Court, where she dazzled the
audience with her fabulous outfits
and stage sets (however my view
was obscured by 2 lovely boys in
cowboy hats). No doubt many were
sad to hear of her illness, but it is
wonderful to see how she’s refused
to hide away and her courage has
given many sufferers hope.
So this season pink seems to be
in, with pink GHD’s (£11 goes to
Breakthrough for every one bought)
and Ralph Lauren’s Pink Collection.
M&S have a lovely vest and short
set in their lingerie department for
Breast Cancer Month (£10+£8).
Madame Tussauds and a host of
celebrities will be showing their sup- “I have cancer- am I bovvered?”

port by adorning their waxworks
with Cancer Research UK’s pinkie
rings. “The Pinkie”, the new must
have accessory for the season,
is a pink ring engraved with the
message “All Women Together”.
London’s glitterati have been bring-

stomping all around town in theirs.
For those lady rowers, give your
usual wellies a kick and step out
in Asda’s ‘Tickled Pink’ variety. All
of the profit from the £10 boots is
split equally between Breast Cancer
Care and Breast Cancer Campaign.
