From penne to puttanesca: an ode to pasta
BROCCOLI
RIPASSATI
Ripassere is the verb ‘to revise’ or ‘to go over’.
It’s a cooking technique in which the food
is cooked twice: in this case, broccoli is first
boiled until tender, and then sautéed with plenty
of olive oil to make a super speedy pasta-sauce
which only requires two pans.
• One head of broc-
coli
• 6 tbsp of extra vir-
gin olive oil
• 2-3 cloves of garlic,
crushed
• Pinch of crushed
chilli
• Short pasta, e.g.
penne, conchiglie,
farfalle
1. Bring a large pan of salted water to the
boil
2. Cut off the florets of broccoli and slice
off the woody outer layer of the stem. Cut
the stem into small chunks.
3. Place the broccoli into the boiling water
and cook for around 10 minutes, until tender.
4. While the broccoli is cooking, heat the
oil in a frying pan and gently fry the gar-
lic and chilli until the garlic is aromatic and
golden – don’t let it burn!
5. Remove the broccoli from the pan with a
slotted spoon or sieve and add to the hot oil,
stirring around to break it up.
6. Boil the pasta in the broccoli water ac-
cording to packet instructions. Continue to
stir the broccoli until it breaks down into a
smooth sauce. Add some pasta cooking wa-
ter if it looks dry.
7. Drain the pasta and toss through with the
broccoli sauce. Serve with parmesan.
I
f there was ever an
argument for the
inherent goodness
of humanity and the
progress of mankind, it
can be summed up in a
single word: pasta. This
humble staple of our diet
is probably one of the
best reasons to be alive
on this earth. Whether it’s
long, worm-like spaghetti
drenched in a carbonara
sauce, or the old work-
horse penne paired with
basil pesto, there is little
that’s more comforting
after a long day.
Pasta can even have
Proustian qualities:
nothing takes me back to
childhood faster than a
bowl of delicate farfalline
coated in my mum’s
tomato sauce. We used to
call it ‘baby pasta’, and it
would be a special treat
to comfort us on cold
nights, or after time away
from home. And the time
I ate so much lasagne I
made myself physically ill
has gone down in family
history.
I am sure that pasta has
such associations for a lot
of people, evoking a sense
of warmth and familiarity.
While pasta can hold
personal meaning for the
individual, it also takes on
a wider cultural meaning:
geographically, you can
divide Italy into different
pasta regions, from Sar-
dinian fregula – round
balls of semolina similar
to couscous – to the
Tuscan pici, whose thick
shape resemble small
snakes; you can also travel
through history, seeing
how pasta reflects the age
in which it was made,
with sheets of lasagne
emerging very early, and
complex shapes like radi-
atori and rotelle – almost
Futurist in their evocation
of machinery – requiring
sophisticated equipment.
Finally, there’s the
sheer linguistic joy that
can come from pasta
shapes: you may know
that penne comes from the
word for pen, and farfalle
is named after butterflies,
but what about gigli, ziti,
or – my personal favour-
ite – strozzapreti, which
means ‘priest-stranglers’,
a name whose etymology
remains hotly contested.
Now that I’ve finished
this little ode to my fa-
vourite carb, it’s time for
a few recipes that can help
you shake up your pasta
routines:
BIGOLI IN SALSA
• One white onion,
thinly sliced
• One tin of anchovies
in olive oil
• Splash of vermouth,
or other dry wine
• Knob of butter
• Long pasta, e.g.
bigoli, spaghetti,
linguine
1. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil.
2. Heat the olive oil from the anchovy tin
in a frying pan over a low heat and add the
onions.
3. Fry the onions gently until very soft –
about 15 mins – and then add the anchovies,
stirring so they melt.
4. Once the anchovies have melted, add a
splash of vermouth and reduce down. Mean-
while, cook the pasta to packet instructions.
5. Drain the pasta and toss through with the
anchovy-onion sauce, plus a knob of butter.
PUTTANESCA
An alleged favourite of
Italian courtesans (this
is in no way true, but
you can’t beat a good
origin story), it’s been a
long staple of mine for the
simple reason that most of the
ingredients come in tins.
• One tin of anchovies
in olive oil
• 2-3 cloves of garlic,
crushed
• Pinch of chilli flakes
• One tin of tuna
• Handful of black
olives, sliced
• Handful of capers
• One tin of chopped
tomatoes
• Your favourite kind
of pasta
1. Begin by heating the anchovies slowly
in a frying pan, with their oil. Once they’ve
melted, add the chilli and garlic, and fry un-
til aromatic.
2. Add the drained tuna, the olives, and the
capers. Stir until it is all mixed up.
3. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes, turn
the heat to low, and simmer for 30-40 min-
utes until the sauce is thickened and re-
duced.
4. Cook pasta according to packet instruc-
tions, and toss through with the sauce.
5. Serve with plenty of parmesan.

This is a classic dish
from the Veneto re-
gion of Italy, which
makes liberal use of
one of my favourite
ingredients: ancho-
vies. Traditionally it is
served with bigoli – long,
hollow tubes of pasta. They’re found
in specialist shops, but if you can’t get
any spaghetti is a good replacement.
