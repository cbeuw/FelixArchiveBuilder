L
ord Robert
Winston faced
outrage online
after saying that
many people who under-
go gender reassignment
surgery end up feeling
“quite badly damaged”
after achieving “horren-
dous results”.
Lord Winston, who
is Professor of Science
and Society at Imperial
College London, made the
comments on the BBC’s
Today Programme on the
1st November, during
a discussion on young
people experiencing
gender dysphoria. Lord
Winston was speaking
with Professor Gary
Butler, consultant in
paediatric and adolescent
medicine and endocrinol-
ogy at University College
Hospital.
Lord Winston, who
is best known for his
security professionals are
located on both sides of
the Metric door on busy
evenings, monitoring and
controlling capacity and
customer flow.”
The Union added:
“The doors from Metric
[leading] directly to the
quad are readily available
for temporary use to ease
capacity issues whenever
required.” According to
our source “bar staff are
instructed not to open
No risk of any harm at Metric, says Union
the fire doors on the side
unless it is an emergency”.
The Union said that the bar
supervisor may “occasion-
ally” temporarily open the
side doors to ease crowd
flow but the doors are
normally kept closed to
reduce noise levels in the
quad (as per an agreement
with Beit Hall). It added
that in an emergency, “bar
and security staff would
lead a swift evacuation
that would use all doors to
safely relocate our guests.”
The Union also said:
“The safety of our
members is paramount to
Imperial College Union
and we would simply
never operate a venue or
event that posed a risk
to our guests. All of the
relevant authorities are
confident that Metric is a
safe venue with effective
crowd management.”
Discussions, which
began before inquiries
by Felix, are underway
between the Union,
Estates Facilities, and
other College teams to
find ways to “permanently
upgrade our abilities to
manage Metric’s access
and egress capacity”. Sug-
gestions include review-
ing where security staff
are located throughout the
evening and expanding the
Metric doors. According
to the Union, “the Fire
Office is clear that Metric
has enough doors to sig-
nificantly exceed the legal
requirements for safety.”

pioneering in vitro ferti-
lization (IVF) techniques
and his media career,
said he was concerned
about epigenetic factors
involved in the perception
of gender, as well as long-
term effects on fertility.
He said: “if you look at
the results of gender re-
assignment [surgery], the
results are horrendous in
a big proportion of cases.”
He also said “about 40%”
of people who undergo
vaginal reconstruction will
require further surgery.
He said he had spoken
to people who had under-
gone such surgeries, and
were now “quite unhappy
people who now feel
badly damaged”. Profes-
sor Butler advised that
the medical sector should
proceed with caution,
saying “there are a lot of
factors we haven’t untan-
gled”
Following the pro-
gramme, there was strong
criticism of Lord Winston
from a number of Twitter
users, who disputed the
sources he had cited. One
saidthathisuseoftheword
‘horrendous’ “is wrong
and discredits you as a
fellow academic”, while
Rachel Evans, a software
engineer for the BBC, said
she was “disappointed that
my employer has, once
again, apparently just
broadcast an inaccurate,
misleading attack on trans
kids”. Zoe O’Connell, a
Liberal Democrat Cam-
bridge city councillor, said
it was “either cluelessness
or dishonest use of statis-
tics to prop up a political
viewpoint.”
Felix spoke to one
student, who said they felt
it was “inappropriate” for
Lord Winston to speak
on a topic in which he’s
not an expert, and it was
“irresponsible” of him to
“to emphasise the nega-
tives of transition without
acknowledging the pos-
itives.” They expressed
that “while Lord Winston
was arguing that we don’t
fully understand the aeti-
ology of gender dysphoria
so we should be cautious
in treating it, there are
plenty of things we don’t
understand in medicine,
and that doesn’t mean we
don’t treat those issues.”
Lord Winston later
stated on Twitter “I have
nothing against transgen-
der [sic]. But I object when
I have cited independent
peer reviewed papers
with full evidence for
what I said”. The Mail on
Sunday then published an
article by Lord Winston,
in which he said he found
it “disturbing to be called
bigoted and homophobic”,
and said that – while many
people are “happy and
grateful” for gender reas-
signment surgery – “until
we understand the under-
lying reason for gender
dysphoria...we must be
extremely cautious.”
In a statement, a College
representative told Felix
“The College upholds
academic freedom within
the law. We fully support
the rights of our staff and
students to participate in
free and open discussion
– particularly on complex
issues where their knowl-
edge and expertise can
help inform debate.”
Data from the Tavistock
Centre’s Gender Identity
Development Service
(GIDS), which was
established for children
and young people expe-
rienced difficulties with
gender identity, showed
a marked rise in referrals
over the last five years.
From 2009/10 to 2015/16,
the number of under-11s
being referred to GIDS
had increased from 23 to
217. The Centre’s GIDS is
the only service of its kind
in the country.
Lord Winston was made
Professor of Science and
Society in 2008, a position
responsible for “devel-
oping paths for better
engagement between sci-
entists and the public”. He
graduated from London
Hospital Medical College,
University of London, in
1964, and was scientific
advisor to the World
Health Organisation’s
programme in human
reproduction in 1975-77.
He presented a number
of BBC series, including
Child of our Time.

Rejoice! The office returns...
Felix is recruiting!
S
o this week the
computers are
back in the office.
Kind of. They’re
not completely back the
way they used to be yet,
but they’re good enough
for me, since I don’t really
understand anything about
technology. The last few
weeks with the servers
being down has really
shown me that, in the
words of Joni Mitchell,
“you don’t know what
you’ve got till it’s gone”.
While putting together
these issues on a single
computer has been stress-
ful, what I really found
difficult was being out of
the office, and not chatting
with any of the great team
who make up Felix (shout
out to you guys!). They’ve
been super patient while
we’ve been having these
issues, ensuring they get
all their work in super
early, and sending sup-
portive emojis. They’re
also the only ones who
read this editorial, apart
from my mum, so props to
them for that.
This week Felix has
beentakingalookatwhat’s
been going on around
campus – for once, it’s an
issue without any mention
of a survey! Blimey! Our
main story of the week is
about crowding at Metric.
It’s not something I would
know a huge amount
about to be honest, since
I spend most of my day
in the West Basement,
and only nip out to make
a beeline to the Central
Library for my muffin fix.
But I’ve been told it’s a
pretty popular place, and
the whole Union Building
is gonna be even busier
once Blackett introduces
pre-poured pints, so it’s
something that needs
to be sorted out. While
the Union says that the
situation isn’t unsafe, it’s
definitely not pleasant for
those trying to get through
that tiny door to the dance-
floor.
We’vealsobeenlooking
at the Bottle Match – the
annual rugby (and other
teams, yeah, but mainly
rugby) match between
Royal School of Mines
and Camborne School of
Mines, which reportedly
was being threatened with
cancellation. Naturally
this upset CSM and RSM
quite a lot, to the extent
that CSM students made
a petition against it being
shut down, but in the end
it was all put down to a
‘communication error’,
and the match will be
going ahead. I got quite
into this drama, and was
planning on going to the
match this year to report
on it, but then I found out
it was in Cornwall. I don’t
go outside the M25, so
that’s a no-no for me, but
maybe next year!
Finally, we’ve reported
on some of the comments
made by Lord Robert
Winston about gender
reassignment surgery,
which he said can leave
many people “quite badly
damaged”. For many
people, this was a classic
case of ‘stay in your lane’:
Lord Winston is a fertility
expert, and not an expert
on gender dysphoria, so
many questioned whether
he should be commenting
on the topic. It’s one thing
to encourage healthy
debate on important issues,
but when trans youth are
at a much higher risk of
suicide than the rest of the
population, hearing such
views being endorsed on
the radio can be incredibly
damaging.
Of course, what I’ve
gone through here is just
the tip of the Felix iceberg.
There’s a full 40 pages of
great quality #content for
you to go through, put
together lovingly by the
Felix team, who were
warmly welcomed back
into the office this week
(although our Sports
Editor has some strange
opinions on figs). So go!
Explore! Enjoy! Just don’t
@ me.
