2. Cate Blanchett
Best Performances:
Carol, The Aviator,
Blue Jasmine, I’m Not
There, Elizabeth
Aussie Blanchett gained
international recognition
in the late nineties for
her lead role in Shekhar
Kapur’s Elizabeth, a role
she would later reprise in a
2007 sequel (incidentally
the film played at Cannes
that year, where she also
appeared as Bob Dylan
in I’m Not There, a mark
of the range of her aston-
ishing talent). In between
these films, Blanchett
proved most adept in sup-
porting roles, most notably
in her Oscar-winning turn
as Katherine Hepburn in
The Aviator. Since then
she has gone from strength
to strength, and delivered
two of the finest lead
performances in recent
years with 2013’s Blue
Jasmine, for which she
won a second Academy
Award, and 2015’s Carol.
Though she has dabbled
in more commercial work
with the Lord of the Rings
and Hobbit trilogies, as
well as recently joining
the Marvel universe as
another poorly written
villain in Thor: Ragnarok,
Blanchett is renowned for
working with some of the
finest filmmakers in the
world, including Martin
Scorsese, Todd Haynes,
“Huppert
is one of
the world’s
most prolific
actresses
having
appeared in
more than 110
films since her
debut in 1971”

1. Isabelle Huppert
Best Performances:
The Piano Teacher,
Elle, Things to Come,
Happy End, White Ma-
terial, 8 Women
Huppert is the most
revered actress in world
cinema. She is also one of
the most prolific, having
appeared in more than
110 films since her debut
in 1971. The superlatives
continue ringing, with
Huppert also the most
successful actress in the
history of France’s Cesar
Award, with 16 nomina-
tions, as well as the most
nominated in history for
its theatre equivalent, the
Molière Award, with 7
nominations (Huppert is
actually a very prominent
stage actress too, and
appeared in a 2014 Sydney
Theatre Company produc-
tion of The Maids opposite
Cate Blanchett, which just
sounds to die for). 2016
was the year that Huppert
came to prominence with

one of the greatest per-
formances of the century
as the ‘post-feminist’
owner of a video game
production company who
refuses to allow her rapist
control her life and shape
her world, fighting back
to devastating effect.
Huppert’s filmography is
intimidatingly brilliant
– this woman is literally
capable of anything. It
is well known that she
is as influential over her
projects’ final product as
the director, and that is
saying something when
she has worked with
the likes of Jean-Luc
Godard, Michael Haneke,
Otto Preminger, Michael
Cimino, Andrzej Wajda,
and David O. Russell. Re-
markably, Huppert shows
no signs of letting up, with
no less than seven films
out this year. Long may
she continue.

5. Marion Cotillard
Best Performances:
La Vie en Rose, Two
Days One Night, The
Immigrant, Rust and
Bone
Hailing from Paris,
Marion Cotillard has
always mixed English and
French roles, particularly
from 2003 onwards. She
announced herself on the
global stage in 2007 by
winning the Oscar for best
actress for her portrayal
of singer Édith Piaf in La
Vie en Rose, becoming
the first person to win an
Academy Award for a
performance in French,
and just the second actress
to win for a part spoken in
a foreign language. Able
to slip seamlessly between
English and French
language roles, her versa-
tility is further exemplified
by the broad range of roles
she has played: a whale
trainer who becomes a
3. Nicole Kidman
Best Performances:
To Die For, Birth, Dog-
ville, Moulin Rouge!,
The Others, The Hours
Born in Hawaii, Aus-
tralian Nicole Kidman is
one of the busiest actress-
es in the world, and is at
the peak of her powers
right now in 2017. Her
career began in the early
eighties, and she made
her Hollywood debut
opposite Tom Cruise in
Days of Thunder in 1990.
The two would fall in love
and were quickly married.
While there were some
good performances from
Kidman in the nineties,
most notably her Golden
Globe-winning turn in Gus
van Sant’s To Die For and
another role with Cruise in
the great Stanley Kubrick’s
final film, Eyes Wide Shut,
it was always felt that she
was performing within
herself, and that she was
capable of much more. It
was only following her
divorce from Cruise in
2001 that she really began
to explore the depths of
her talent. While still
starring in commercially
successful films, Kidman
branched out into daring
independent dramas with
interesting international
filmmakers, working with
the likes of Lars von Trier,
Jane Campion, Park Chan
Wook, Werner Herzog,
Sofia Coppola, and Yorgos
Lanthimos. This brave
attitude gave her instant
success, earning back-to-
back Oscar nominations
for Moulin Rouge! and
The Hours, and winning
for the latter. She is cur-
rently enjoying a renais-
sance, and in the last year
alone she has dominated
television with Big Little
Lies and Top of the Lake,
as well as returning to the
academy circle with a sup-
porting actress nomination
for Lion. At the Cannes
film festival this year she
had three films debut, as
well as a television series,
leading her to receive a
special award for its 70th
anniversary, in recognition
of her incredible form.

4. Julianne Moore
Best Performances:
Boogie Nights, Mag-
nolia, Safe, Far From
Heaven, Still Alice, The
Hours
Julianne Moore first
grabbed critics’ attention
in Robert Altman’s Short
Cuts, and managed to es-
tablish herself as a leading
lady in Hollywood in the
late nineties, with her best
performances coming
under two very different
filmmakers: Todd Haynes
and a young Paul Thomas
Anderson. Specialising
in portraying sensitive,
troubled women, Moore
was perhaps at her best in
2002, when she garnered
Oscar nominations for
both Best Actress and
Best Supporting Actress,
for Far From Heaven and
The Hours respectively.
She has continued to
almost always be the best
part of the films she was
in throughout her career,
working with prestigious
directors in Anderson,
Altman, Haynes, the Coen
Brothers, Alfonso Cuaron,
and David Cronenberg.
She had a second peak of
sorts in 2014 when she
won the best actress award
at Cannes for Maps to
the Stars, and then finally
