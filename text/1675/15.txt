Weezer wheezes out another fucking travesty...
O
h, Rivers. What
an absolute
shame, the
mess you’ve
ended up in. Weezer was
hot shit in the ‘90s. The
Blue Album spoke to a
generation of individuals
who felt introverted and
alone. It was a dorky,
confessional, energetic
mess – and never once
did the heart fail to shine
through. Then, the story
goes, you got bored of
laying groupies, you were
longing for something
“deeper,” and you put out
Pinkerton, your last good
album (though it was
skewered by the critics
of the day). But, Rivers,
your goofy attempts to
reanimate the band have
thoroughly alienated your
original fans. If you were
so aghast at the idea of
selling out, why did you?
After Pinkerton, the
band broke up, a hiatus
that lasted for five years.
But their return, and
subsequent albums, were
never the same. They seem
to have lost their target de-
mographic, focusing their
efforts instead on trying
to make songs that would
chart – except they never
really did. The dorky fun
of their old albums was
abandoned, and replaced
with straight-up medioc-
rity. The albums are limp
and flaccid, and have
none of the spark that
captivated so many so few
years earlier. The lyrics
were watered down and
meaningless. The guitar
had none of the appealing
quirk. The introduction of
some electronic textures
did little to appeal to their
old fanbase and were too
forced to make it main-
stream (and that was a low
bar in the mid-00’s). They
were making music for
nobody, and they knew it.
Catching word that a
new Weezer album is out
soon brings me an eerie
sense of the passing of
time, a kind of déjà vu.
At first, there’s a pang of
excitement, a nostalgic
what-if-the-old-Weezer-
is-back hope that they’ve
shitcanned their generic
washed-out pop sound,
and are going back to their
roots, to the ethos that
made their first two albums
so close to my heart while
I was growing up. Then
the singles roll out (strike
one), they post some dorky
shit on their Facebook
about how they’re going
back to their old sound for
real this time (strike two),
and finally the album in its
entirety is here, and it’s a
generic washed-out poppy
mess with no appeal to
either the mainstream or
the last desperately-cling-
ing-on fan (strike three).
The new album is a
mess of generic lyrics that
appeal to nobody, featur-
ing no new musical ideas
for the band besides trying
to sound like a washed-up
pop star trying to mount a
comeback, and incorpo-
rating absolutely nothing
appealing to any person
with working ears. Try and
find a target audience for
this album – you can’t. It’s
an uncompelling, boring,
mediocre medley of bland
guitar sounds and sappy,
saccharine, vomit-induc-
ing lyrics, with few, if
any redeeming moments
in sight. Listening to this
album felt like trying to
move my bowels during
a round of intense consti-
pation, without the sense
of accomplishment that
comes with finishing up.
I’d almost, almost rather
read Atlas Shrugged.
Here’s a taste of the
blandness: Rivers col-
lected random snippets
of lyrics over the past ten
years, stuck them into a
spreadsheet, then hired
programmers to figure out
information like possible
progressions and beats
per minute. This is how
he wrote the album. Quoth
Cuomo: “Instead of trying
to force myself to feel
inspired, I can just go into
the spreadsheet and search
...I just try them out to see
which ones work mag-
ically.” Fuck you, bud.
Pacific Daydream ex-
hausted me to listen to. It’s
phoned-in pap. I’d rather
lick roadkill than listen to
it again. The album has
less flavor than a cheese
sandwich, ready-salt-
ed crisps, and water
meal deal from Tesco.
This album is another
stepping stone in the
band’s slow march to
obscurity. Godspeed.
... and an aktual-ly good album this week
B
orn in Iran
and raised in
London, beat
wizard Ashkan
Kooshanejad, better
known by his alias Ash
Koosha, broke into the
electronic scene with
debut album Guud in 2015.
Taking the freneticism of
Flying Lotus’ signature
LA beat weirdness further,
it seemed to spectators
that Koosha could do no
wrong. Guud was a mon-
olith, dark and brooding,
complex and suffocating,
like Godspeed You! Black
Emperor ditched the
instruments for a MIDI
keyboard and a DAW.
Koosha continued these
motifs on his sophomore
effort, IAKAI, but at a
decidedly lower energy
level, without moving
the sonic palette forward.
On AKTUAL, Koosha
channels the earlier energy
of Guud, while exploring
new ground through vocal
performances. These sonic
textures enable Koosha
to accomplish more than
his earlier efforts – he
hits his highest high with
track ‘TrappistOne’, a
poised, delicate, and
slowly-evolving piano
composition that ebbs and
flows its way to a subtle
climax – denoted by the
subtle introduction of a
synthesizer into the bass.
However (and unlike
earlier efforts), the incon-
sistent textures, sounds,
and ideas do not comple-
ment the disjointed nature
of this LP. The juxtaposi-
tion of more complex IDM
pieces versus the sombre
vocal performances makes
AKTUAL feel more like
a string of demos, with
highs and lows, but a
distinct lack of coherence.
The album has lush sonic
highs, but entirely misses
any sense of binding theme
or narrative, a context for
any of these compositions.
As such, the album is
reducedtoasetofsketches,
a B-side album from a
man without the reputa-
tion to get away with it.
I wasn’t sure about the art, but the Japanese writing sold me. // Crush Management
