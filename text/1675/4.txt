A response to those who criticise the Balfour
Declaration
To say that the Balfour Declaration brought together two mutually-exclusive movements
misinterprets the real situation.

I
n today’s 140-char-
acter world, it’s
all too easy to blur
the line between
fact and fiction, and
apply false assumptions
leading to fallacious
beliefs. When we opened
last week’s edition
of the Felix, we were
greeted by an article
entitled “The Balfour
Declaration: A Century
On”. We were eager
to read on: an opinion
most likely opposing our
own, and written by an
Imperial student – thus
presumably logically
thought out and support-
ed by evidence. What
better way of challeng-
ing one’s own beliefs?
Unfortunately, we got
as far as the second
sentence, before I began
to find unsubstantiated
arguments and sweeping
generalizations.
The extent to which the
author misses the central
basis of Zionism is clear
from the outset, when
she defines Zionism as
a “cause, which aims to
establish a safe, Jewish
homeland.” Find us
another definition of
Zionism that excludes a
mention of the land of
Israel. She goes on to say
“[Zionism] does not take
into account the fact that
their homeland of choice
was already inhabited by
the Palestinians.” The as-
sertion, as it comes across,
is that the Jewish aspira-
tion for a homeland just
happens to focus on Israel.
It fails to recognise the
deep emotional connection
between Jewish people
and the region that spans
millennia. There is no
mention of the undisputed
archaeological evidence
of Jewish statehood there
two thousand years ago.
No mention of the thou-
sands of years for which
Jews have prayed the
words “l’shana haba’ah
b’Yerushalayim” – “next
year in Jerusalem”.
One of the most trou-
blesome tropes the author
uses, not once but three
times, is the phrase “ethnic
cleansing”. Not only is this
demonstrably incorrect,
but it is shamefully hurtful
to those who have suffered
such atrocities. If Israel
follows a policy of ethnic
cleansing, how would you
explain a nearly five-fold
increase in the Palestinian
population since 1948? If
fingers are being pointed,
then how do you reconcile
the expulsion of 850,000
Jews from nearly all Arab
countries in 1948 (leaving
under 4,000 remaining),
with the 1.4 million Arab
citizens that now make up
20% of Israel’s popula-
tion. The author refers to
the founders of Zionism
as “those who wished for
the ethnic cleansing of
indigenous Palestinians”.
Can these be the same
people that, in 1948, put
their name on the Israeli
Declaration of Independ-
ence, which states that
“We appeal… to the Arab
inhabitants of the State of
Israel to preserve peace…
on the basis of full and
equal citizenship and due
representation…” What
possible basis does the
author have to make the
unfounded claim that the
early Zionists wished to
create a “solely Jewish
state”? On the contrary,
David Ben Gurion (the
first prime minister of
Israel) wrote in a letter
in 1937 “We do not wish
… to expel the Arabs and
take their place… there
is enough room in the
country for ourselves and
the Arabs.” To falsely
accuse these founding
fathers of the horrendous
crime of ethnic cleansing
is an inexcusable offense
to the truth, a commodity
so precious in the pursuit
of peace and justice.
This forms the basis
of the problem with the
other common buzzword
that the author brings
up – the libellous accu-
sation that Israel is an
“apartheid state”. As
Kenneth Meshoe, a black
South African who lived
through apartheid, puts it,
“because it is so inaccu-
rate, it betrays the memory
of those who suffered
through a real apartheid.”
The inconvenient truth is
that Israeli Arabs enjoy
full and equal rights –
there is not a single Israeli
law that singles out Israeli
Arabs, or treats them in
any way differently from
other Israelis. It is a fre-
quently ignored fact that
out of 120 seats in Israel’s
Knesset (parliament), 13
belong to an Arab party,
the Joint List. In what
example of apartheid does
one see those that are sup-
posedly being discriminat-
ed against in positions at
the highest levels of law,
science and media?
The crux of the problem
issignifiedwhentheauthor
claims that the Balfour
Declaration supports “two
conflicting and mutually
exclusive movements.”
Unfortunately, it is this
type of narrow minded
thinking that presents a
real barrier to peace; to
believe that your very
offer of peace and good
neighbourliness, and
appeal to them to establish
bonds of cooperation…”
Meanwhile, at the 1967
Arab League summit,
eight Arab leaders agreed
upon the Khartoum Res-
olution, which contained
the Three No’s: “no peace
with Israel, no recognition
of Israel, no negotiations
with it…”
The author asserts that
the Balfour Declaration
did not help those fleeing
anti-Semitism. Tell that
to the Jews worldwide,
including those who have
already fled anti-Semitism
from across Europe and
the Arab Nations, who are
celebrating the centenary
of Balfour, in the knowl-
edge that they are now
safe from persecution.
Rather than lamenting
Balfour, we would argue
that we should celebrate it
for what it has created – a
beacon of hope for Jews
worldwide – and what,
with a bit of work, it can
create – a peaceful contri-
bution to the region.
Referring to sweeping
generalisations as “widely
agreed” facts, and basing
arguments on emotive
buzzwords might make
a good story. But when
solving a centuries-old
conflict, that affects the
lives of millions of people
every day, arguments must
be based on facts. From
first-hand experience of
dealing with peacefully
minded Palestinians and
Israeli Arabs, there is no
need for Zionism and
the quest for Palestinian
sovereignty to be conflict-
ing. Finger pointing and
looking for a fight gets
us nowhere – working
together, building bridges,
and seeing each other for
what we are truly worth is
the only basis for a lasting
peace in the Middle East.

that in the Israel-Palestine

is very much one-sided.
