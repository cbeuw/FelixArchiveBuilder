“Since the
students we
have here
haven’t been
taught‘Here is
the style that
you should be
writing in’it
frees them up
a little more to
write in their
own way”
but I don’t think the dip in
quality is a noticeable as
you might expect. If you
compare Felix to Pi Media
at UCL or The Beaver
at LSE they’re of pretty
similar quality.
A: Because we at Im-
perial haven’t been
taught a formula for
how to write an article
do you think that’s an
advantage we have,
to avoid everything
becoming stale?
F: Speaking from expe-
rience in medicine – and
I think it’s pretty similar
for other disciplines as
well – you spend a lot of
your time reading and
analysing data and the
scientific literature. I
think that tempers your
mind to going through a
lot of material and then
distilling it down to your
lab report or coursework.
So, I think that’s one thing
that scientists have that
isn’t as prominent in other
subjects.
I think as well, for me
it’s really important as
an editor that, although
you obviously want your
writers to be good and
up to scratch, you also
want them to have their
own personal style and
you don’t want to impose
your style on them. So,
throughout my editorial
career I’ve always been
very careful to look at
a piece and think “Am
I changing it because it
needs to be changed? Or
am I changing it because
this is how I would
write it?” It’s a fine line
between those two. Since
the students we have here
haven’t been taught “Here
is the style that you should
be writing in” it frees them
up a little more to write in
their own way.
A: Normally at this
point, I’d ask if you’re
interest in the arts is a
hobby, or if they want
to pursue it as a job,
but Editor in Chief of
Felix is, in fact, your
job. Was there an ex-
perience or an event
that motivated you to
run for the position?
F: To be honest, I’d been
thinking about it for three
or four years – when you
do a medical degree, you
have a massive amount
of time to dwell on stuff
– and I’d always planned
to run in this year. I think
the most formative experi-
ence was in my third year
when I was running the
Arts section with Kamil
McClelland, another
medic in my year, and
during that year we both
got really involved. Our
studies probably suffered
a bit, but we were putting
out six to eight pages
of Arts a week, and we
edited three editions of the
Phoenix arts magazine on
top of that. It was a really
rewarding experience and
probably the trigger point
to get more involved in
Felix. And here we are
today.
A: And how are you
enjoying the job so
far?
F: We’ve had some IT
issues over the past few
weeks. We’ve had no
computers [in the Felix
office] so I’ve been putting
everything together which
is not as fun. The first few
weeks before that were
really good and I think we
were really bonding as an
editorial team and learning
their skills. For the past
few weeks we haven’t
been able to do that so
it’s been quite frustrating.
Apart from that it’s been
very good. Oh, and people
complaining have not been
good either, but I think I’m
starting to develop a thick
skin.
A: Do you have any
plans for the paper
this year that you’re
excited to enact?
Obviously, the style
of the paper has
changed this year.
F: Last year it was a very
free layout and I think it
was quite ambitious. This
year we’ve got a lot of
new people in who haven’t
used InDesign before and
I think last year’s layout
would have been really
tough on them. So, we
simplified it and stripped
it back down.
In terms of future
developments, one
thing I’m really trying
to push this year is the
Longread. We’ve had two
so far; they’re three to
four-thousand words on
a single topic and people
can go really in-depth.
We’re going to be trying
to publish more of those
throughout the year. More
generally, holding the
College and the Union to
account more, and doing
F: What appeals to me
more is writing the in-
teresting pieces: it’s the
sexy bit of journalism
that everyone’s interested
in. The New Yorker, for
example, does a lot of
investigative journalism
where they get all this
data and all these different
viewpoints and draw
it together into a really
well-written narrative. It
goes back to the New Jour-
nalism School in the ‘60s
where you have people
like Joan Didion, and
Truman Capote writing
In Cold Blood. That kind
of journalism I find really
exciting and something
I’d like to pursue more
of. I’m not saying Felix
is going to be as good as
Joan Didion’s work, but
we have high aspirations.
A: Looking to the fu-
ture, there’s a chance
that in the next ten
years Felix will change
a lot, especially in
terms of how it’s pub-
lished with a battle
between print and
online. How do you
see the paper chang-
ing?
F: I’m a strong proponent
of print and print media,
but I think it’s a really
difficult time for print and
journalism in general. In
terms of Felix I’d love it
to carry on in print, but
I think there’s general
pressure to move uni pub-
lications to online-only
platforms. This year the
Union is carrying out a
Felix Review where they
look at the funding model
and the aims of the paper;
it’s not being done with
the goal of moving away
from print, but one of the
findings might be that the
paper is not cost effective
and having it in print
doesn’t bring a particular
value. I’d disagree and
say it has a lot of value,
but you can’t measure the
monetary value of print
and the benefits it brings,
you can only measure the
negative, which is how
much it costs.
That being said, print
media is a bit like vinyl
records, in that it’s expe-
riencing a bit of a surge
right now, especially with
micro-publishing. And I
think people are getting
tired of online journalism.
If you look at a website
like The Independent and
the amount of advertising
they need to sustain that
model, I think that’s
turning a lot people off
and turning them back to
print media.
We’ll see what happens,
but whatever comes of the
Felix review I’m going
to be pushing to keep the
paper in print.
A: Whether it’s physi-
cal or digital, how do
you see Felix’s role in
the future changing?
F: The motto of Felix is
‘Keep the cat free’ and
I think that’s going to
continue.Ithinkhaveafree
press is the cornerstone of
any democracy, especially
a student democracy. The
core aims of Felix are to
represent the student voice
and to ensure their views
are heard by the College
and Union and ensure no
changes are made about
you, without you. That’s
something I strongly
believe in and I think
going forward if Felix
loses that, there’s no point
in having it anymore.

some more investigative
journalism. I feel for the
last couple of years there
hasn’t been a huge amount
of that done at Felix.

Investigative jour-
nalism piece are you
more interested in
getting a scoop, or
writing an interesting
piece?

Arts Editor Adam Gellatly talks with Felix’s very own Editor in Chief Fred Fyles to chat about arts at Imperial and
his current and previous roles at the paper.
ARTS
Adam Gellatly
Arts Editor
“I think in all
subjects there’s
a minority
that are into
the arts, but
those that are
go deep. No
matter what
subject you’re
in you can find
your niche”
Adam: Readers will
know you as the cur-
rent Editor of Felix,
but you were involved
in the Arts Section at
the paper before that.
Can describe how that
involvement came
about?
Fred: I’ve always been in-
terested in arts and culture.
I grew up in London and
when I was younger I went
to the theatre a lot and my
parents would take me to
art galleries. Coming to
Imperial, I knew I wanted
to write for the paper and
get involved with the Arts
section. I mainly started
doing reviews of visual
culture – I think my first
article was about the
Turner Prize – and theatre.
Towards the end of first
year I started really getting
intofilmandinsecondyear
I took a Horizons course
that introduced me to the
philosophy and theory of
art. Then in third year I
started editing on Felix
and that got me interested
in graphic design. It’s been
bits and bobs throughout
the years leading to an
accumulation of interests.
A: Were you interested in
the arts at school?
F: At A-Level I did
Biology, Chemistry,
Maths, and Further Maths,
so not very arty at all. I
did History AS, but that
was as humanities as it
got. Coming to university
changed that a lot. I grew
up in North London, but I
went to school near Hert-
fordshire where there’s not
a huge amount of cultural
stuff to do. In first year,
living in South Kensington
where the South Bank and
the Tate are just a bus-ride
away, it really opens up
how much you can go
and do and see. That’s
also when I started getting
into the student discounts.
When I was in first and
second year, Barbican
used to run the FreeB
scheme – every single
month they’d release loads
of tickets – and I’d go to
five or six things a month
from that.
A: Do you think
Medical students
have more of an
open-mindedness
when it comes to in-
terests in the arts,
compared to those
studying a natural sci-
ence or engineering?
F: My impression of
Imperial is that all subjects
are pretty similar in terms
of how artistic people
are; I think in all subjects
there’s a minority that are
into the arts, but those that
are go deep. No matter
what subject you’re in you
can find your niche and
people who are interested
in arts as well.
I guess with medicine,
there’s more of an op-
portunity to bring what
you do in arts into your
vocational practice. Last
year I did six weeks in a
psychiatry placement and
one of the consultants
there said, “Everything
you do and everything
you see can feed into your
psychiatry practice”. You
have to understand where
the patient is coming from,
where they’re located in
their cultural context.
A: As we’ve discussed
before in this seg-
ment, there’s the per-
ception from outside
Imperial – and from
perhaps the inside –
that we’re all about
STEM here as that’s
all we study. Do you
think the quality of
the arts output at Im-
perial suffers from the
lack of, say, English
students?
F: Focusing on Felix
specifically, you might
look at the fact we have
no English, Journalism, or
History students and think
that means very few people
are going to get involved,
or that there’ll be very few
writers of quality. That’s
definitely not the case.
The writers and editors
we have are top quality
and really committed. I
actually think it’s a benefit
that we don’t have English
or Journalism students
here; it means the people
who get involved in arts
at Imperial are not getting
into it with the mind of
doing it as a career and
building up a portfolio,
but because they really
enjoy it.
But if we did have those
English students, I think
the team would be bigger.
It would relieve some of
the pressure on the section
editors – they’d definitely
have more contributors.
So, in some ways you
could say the quality does
suffer a little. If we had a
whole raft of Journalism
students I think we’d
probably have a bigger
paper with more content,
