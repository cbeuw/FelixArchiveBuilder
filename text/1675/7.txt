The Paradise Papers show why offshore
continues to be a massive problem
Offshore is a pot of gold for companies and individuals, allowing them to hide their wealth
from the public view and helping to create massive inequality

O
nce again, a
major leak from
the offshore fi-
nancial centres
of the world has been re-
leased to the general press.
Nicknamed the “Paradise
Papers”, these documents
mostly contain dealings
of the Appleby law firm
– their clients come from
all over the world, with the
only unifying factor being
their desire to conceal their
wealth from the taxmen
of various major states.
This leak follows on
from the Panama Papers
last year, which resulted
in the resignation of the
Icelandic president, the
assassination of a Maltese
journalist, and the expo-
sure of Mossac Fonseca,
a Panamanian law firm, as
a supplier of financial and
legal support to some of
the world’s most unscru-
pulous individuals.
These leaks partially
reveal the inner workings
of the offshore industry,
which focus on providing
tax havens for wealthy
individuals and companies
to protect their assets from
tax. These companies are
centred around geographi-
cal locations where tax can
be more easily avoided,
such as British Crown De-
pendencies, US states like
Delaware, and small coun-
tries such as Mauritias or
Panama. Firms work out
of these locations as they
either provide very low
tax opportunities, such
as the Isle of Man, where
inheritance tax does not
exist, or allow for the
easy creation of shell
companies, which make
the accounting process
more opaque and help to
conceal the true extent of
how much an individual
or company owns. It also
allows for the provision
of a certain amount of
anonymity by allowing
the individual or company
to disassociate themselves
from their wealth whilst
still benefitting from it.
This is a huge issue for
every single individual
that does not benefit from
these schemes.
The nations and de-
pendencies that tax havens
are set up in rely upon the
very wealthy depositing
their funds with them
and then profiting from
the legal, managerial, and
accounting fees. They
cannot envisage another
way of doing business
that would provide them
with a similar GDP and
standard of living for their
residents. One investiga-
tive journalist, Nicholas
Shaxson, describes these
locations as “captured
states,” in which private
interest forms the basis of
public policy. The British
Crown Dependencies have
become important tax
havens due to their lack
of financial solvency. This
lack of a second option for
many of these tax havens
ensures their presence in
the world for a long time
to come.
The very rich paying
little to no tax is not a new
phenomenon. Individuals
with the majority of the
wealth have often pos-
sessed an undue amount
of influence with the body
that sets the tax. In today’s
world the relationship
between the very wealthy
and the political bodies
that set the tax is very
tight – often being the
same people – but public
scrutiny and influence
limits the amount of
acceptable cronyism,
hence the existence of
tax havens. The estimates
for how much money is
offshore vary wildly, from
around $7 trillion up to
$36 trillion, but no one
really knows for certain.
For comparison US GDP
is estimated at $18.57
trillion. Of the money
concealed offshore, it has
been proposed that 0.01%
of the world’s wealthiest
own 50%, with 0.1%
owning 80%. This demon-
strates the tiny number of
individuals using these
tax havens and begins to
reveal the extent to which
tax havens contribute to
inequality.
In an attempt to ethical-
ly justify their existence,
the companies that run
these offshore schemes
have posited that they
are necessary to prevent
government over-taxation.
Given that these schemes
are exclusively for the very
wealthy, I would dispute
this, as it does not so much
prevent over-taxation as
provide an option for indi-
viduals and companies to
avoid their obligations to
the societies in which they
operate. The net result of
avoiding their obligations
is an overall reduction in
the funds available to pay
for public services and
therefore a requirement
to increased taxation of
those who cannot avoid
tax: the poorer members
of society.
Offshore finance
found that hundreds of
millions of pounds worth
of property was used
by offshore companies
to launder money for
criminals and corrupt of-
ficials. In a market where
hundreds of millions is an
insignificant amount there
is undoubtedly far more
wealth hiding from the
gaze of officials.
A further effect of tax
havens is to force other
nation states to lower
their taxes in an attempt
to obtain some revenue
from wealthy people.
Ireland is an example of
one such nation taking
these measures, but it was
forced to pay $15 billion
in back taxes for providing
Apple with illegal state
aid. This has provoked
controversy in the US, as
it believes that these back
taxes should be paid there
and not to the EU.
This raises the ultimate
question: how to reduce
the use of tax havens?
Although various nations
around the world now
track the amount of wealth
hidden offshore there has
been no serious attempt by
the UK or any other major
players to increase the
amount of regulation. A
proposed solution would
be to track all wealth and
assets around the world,
but the level of transpar-
ency required for this is
likely unattainable. The
only main intervention on
the behalf of transparency
comes from these irregular
leaks. Offshore is a thorny
problem, and one that will
not disappear as long as
wealthy individuals do not
fulfil their obligations to
society.
The net result of
offshore has been a contri-
bution to the ever-increas-
ing inequality between the
rich and poor. If they don’t
pay, we will have to.
