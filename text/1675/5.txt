Tuition fees are completely nonsensical: it’s
time we scrapped them, for good
Everybody benefits from having a well-educated population, but why baulk at funding higher
education? There’s no good argument for tuition fees.

here is no more
obvious hot-but-
ton issue for UK
students at the
moment than tuition fees.
Their trebling in the past
few years was met with a
wave of student anger, and
Labour’s position at the
last election – abolishing
fees, though not cancel-
ling past debt – doubtless
helped them curry favour
with students (though
it would be ridiculous
to assert this was the
sole reason for their
electoral success among
younger demographics).
It’s obvious why students
might oppose fees –
they’re the ones who end
up saddled with debt.
However, there are many
strong moral and eco-
nomic arguments against
them: reasons to oppose
tuition fees on the grounds
of principle rather than
self-interest.
The most obvious
thing to point out is that
you, me, and pretty much
any other reasonable
person already agree that
education should be free,
but for some reason we
exclude higher education
from this. As a society, we
decided it was better to
have a literate population
that an illiterate one, and
primary education became
free and mandatory. We
then decided an educated
population would be pref-
erable to an uneducated
one, and so secondary
education became free and
mandatory, and the age at
which we are expected to
remain in education has
increased in proportion to
economic advancement.
However, we’ve seen the
opposite trend in higher
education. Both for in-
dividuals and for wider
society, this could be ex-
tremely damaging; some
form of higher education
(though not necessarily
formal university educa-
tion) is steadily becoming
increasingly necessary for
citizens to compete in an
advanced economy.
The facile argument that
it’s somehow fair to charge
students high fees because
they have a higher earning
potential can be dispensed
with on individualistic
grounds – students end up
paying for their education
twice, once through fees
and again through general
taxation (fees don’t cover
everything, and a lot of
student debt gets written
off). The minimum thresh-
old to pay back tuition fees
is £21,000, by no means a
high salary, so it’s difficult
to argue that if you don’t
reap the financial fruits
of your education you’ll
avoid debt – to do so you’d
have to live on a wage no
graduate would consider
sufficient, for 35 years.
However, the earning
potential argument is
flawed in its premise,
since it implies that
education has no value
to anyone other than the
degree holder (note the
aforementioned emphasis
on ‘citizens’ not ‘gradu-
ates’). Everyone benefits
from having an educated
population. You wouldn’t
expect firefighters to pay
for their training, why
expect medics and engi-
neers to do so? Though the
benefit of other degrees
may be less obvious, it’s
still tangible, and thus it
would be fairer to fund
education as we do almost
everything else: through
progressive taxation.
The common argument
against this is the “why
should people who aren’t
using it pay for it?” trope,
but ask yourself – why
fund roads if you don’t
drive a car? Why fund
hospitals if you’re young
and healthy? Because
someday, you might need
to use those services, and
even if you don’t, you
benefit from living in a
society that has them. If
that leap can be made for
infrastructure and health-
care, it should be easily
enough made for educa-
tion (perhaps even leading
us to a National Education
Service). Where do you
think the people required
for the former are trained,
anyway?
The reticence to fund
education through taxation
rather than fees rests in
the commonly held sen-
timent that the former is
somehow more punitive
than the latter, but in fact
the reverse is true, since
over the former democra-
cy has some sway, and the
public interest, rather than
individual interest, can be
nullified, underscoring
the ridiculousness of our
current high fees.
The arguments made
thus far have rested on
pragmatism, but other
points are relevant. For
one thing, tuition fees
weren’t instituted until the
late 1990s: almost all the
politicians who now say,
“it’s impractical” to fund
higher education them-
selves went to university
for free. For another, we
have to ask ourselves
how we want to approach
education – do we believe
learning holds any value
in and of itself, and do
we as a society want to
encourage it wherever
possible, or only where
there is economic benefit
to be derived. These points
aren’t required to argue
against tuition fees, but
should nonetheless not be
neglected when contem-
plating education policy.
Arguments for tuition
fees are rested in the falla-
cious ‘fact’ that education
is only a benefit to the
holder of the degree and
not to the rest of society.
Examining things holis-
tically makes tuition fees
much harder to defend.
Based on the effect of
debt and the benefit an
educated population has
for the economy, it should
be argued not that we can’t
afford to abolish tuition
fees, but that we can’t
afford not to.

Saddling a generation
of students with debt as
we do now makes little
economic sense. In an era
where consumer spending
could be encouraged
to stimulate economic
growth, we’ve instead
seen policies deliberately
crafted to increase debt
on students, with ever
increasing fees and the ab-
olition of grants. Sources
– by no means left-wing,
including Business Insider
and The Market Mogul
– express consternation
at the “fiscal time bomb”
precipitated by rising debt.
The latter source indicates
that, since three quarters
of students will never pay
off their debt in full, any
proposed savings to public
spending from trebling
fees are close to being

S
ince the General
Election of 2010
we have seen
tuition fees rise
under a coalition govern-
ment to £9,000 per year.
We have heard no end of
complaining, by students
and politicians alike,
about the gross injustice
of University tuition fees.
Frankly, I am appalled
by their clamours, and
shocked that anyone has
the gall to pretend as if
University fees in this
country are a “neoliberal
assault on education”.
First off, let me start by
saying that, in my opinion,
tuition fees are completely
justified. There is no one
forcing you to pursue
a higher educational
degree, and taking on the
financial responsibility is
a choice that you make.
When you choose to
pursue a degree, you are
adding significant value
to your future earnings,
with graduates earning an
average of £10,000 more
per year than those who
do not attend university.
If this experience – which
costs the University a
significant amount to
provide – hands you a
piece of paper that allows
you to command a higher
salary for most of your
working life, and have a
faster and broader career
trajectory, why on Earth
should it simply be handed
out? University education
adds real monetary value
to your life, and to there-
fore pay for a high-quality
education seems entirely
reasonable. Again, this is a
choice that you make – if
you want a certain career,
or to earn more money,
then you can choose to
pay for three years of Uni-
versity education to fulfil
these plans. To selfishly
demand that someone else
should hand out whatever
you think you deserve,
and fund it by “taxation of
business and the rich” (a
moronically meaningless
assertion) is abhorrently
self-centred. If you think
it is of value to your life,
pay for it; if you don’t,
then don’t. Make no
mistake that education is a
privilege. The fact that we
are lucky enough in this
country to have primary
education and secondary
education provided
for free has apparently
numbed selfish students to
this fact, and they are so
blinded by their inflated
parameters of what they
deserve that they demand
to have it paid for indeter-
minately.
The calls in this country
to abolish university
tuition fees have outraged
me beyond just the fact
that I think fees are a
reasonable proposition.
The United Kingdom has
some of the top universi-
ties in the world, and their
annual costs in relation
to similarly high quality
establishments is eye wa-
teringly low. The top four
universities in the world
– MIT, Stanford, Harvard,
and Caltech – all charge
in the region of £38,000
per year. Compare that
to the next four – Cam-
bridge, Oxford, UCL, and
Imperial (I think they must
have made a mistake in the
ordering of those last two)
– which charge £9,250.
The standards of learning
and research across these
institutions is roughly the
same, and the career pros-
pects are commensurately
exceptional. Yet we pay
over four times less for
this privilege – and we
the rich’ – those fairytale
bogeymen who already
disproportionately prop up
the NHS and the welfare
system - to pay for your
career advancement and
higher salary.
To top it all off, this
ingratitude comes in the
face of what must be the
most generous student
loans system in the world.
Not only are our fees
incredibly low relative to
the quality of education,
but everyone, no matter
what they study and
where, is guaranteed a full
loan covering tuition fees
by Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment. Then, we only end
up having to start paying
these off once we earn over
£21,000, and, even once
this starts, the repayment
is capped at 9% of your
salary. This means that you
are only paying back the
universally-granted loan
you have been given once
you begin to personally
reap the rewards of the
education you have been
handed. ‘Yes’, you might
argue, ‘but what if your
earnings don’t increase?
Then the education has
done nothing for you!’.
This may unfortunately
turn out to be the case,
but, if that happens, guess
what? All your debt is
written off after 30 years.
So, if your earnings don’t
rise sufficiently for you to
pay back your education,
you just… don’t pay it
back. In essence, all you
are paying for, eventually,
is the premium value
added to your career by
your degree.
To give you an example
of just how low the re-
payments end up being,
consider the following
student: they graduates
from a globally-leading
university, say, Imperial
College, and have total
tuition debt of £29,485,
including interest accrued
fees, and the extraordinar-
ily favourable conditions
under which we repay
them, provide all students
in this country with an un-
paralleled opportunity to
pursue a higher education,
should they choose to do
so. Consistently jumping
on the socialist bandwag-
on, and demanding more
and more at someone
else’s expense, reflects an
attitude of entitlement, and
frankly total ingratitude
for the privilege we are
being offered by our Gov-
ernment and educational
system. I implore you,
therefore, not to go to the
aforementioned rally, and
to appreciate the fortune
with which you have been
bestowed by our Universi-
ty system.

“MIT, Stanford,
Harvard,

all charge in
the region of
£38,000”
during studies. They get
a great job at the Imperial
average graduate salary at
£37,006 a year. This means
that they are paying back
roughly £120 a month, or
£1,440 a year. Assuming,
extremely conservatively,
that their earnings don’t
increase at all, they will
pay back the entirety of
their tuition in these small
instalments after a little
over 20 years. In all like-
lihood, of course, Imperial
graduates will get jobs in
high-trajectory fields, and
earnings will hopefully
be rising of the course of
their careers. If so, they
will pay off their debt even
sooner – in the region of
just over 10 years.
Hopefully, it is clear
that the size of the total
continue to moan about it?
How long will the selfish
demands for endlessly
free things go unchecked?

costs, and consider how
