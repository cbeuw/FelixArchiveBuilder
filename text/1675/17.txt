First They Killed My Father: Angelina Jolie’s first
directorial triumph
With FirstThey Killed My Father, Angelina Jolie retells a story of intense hardship and miraculous survival through
the eyes of a child that experienced it all.
F
irst They Killed
My Father, sub-
titled A Daughter
of Cambodia
Remembers, tells the
story of Cambodian
author Loung Ung and her
battle to stay alive under
the brutal regime of the
Khmer Rouge. Most films
that deal with war often
tend to hover around a
particular incident during
the conflict. Whether
that be the evacuation
of Dunkirk (Dunkirk),
the Battle of Okinawa
(Hacksaw Ridge), or the
struggle to bring a fellow
soldier back home (Saving
Private Ryan). These films
tell the story of war as a
hero’s journey to over-
come enormous obstacles
and complete their mission
in service to their country
and fellow soldiers.
Other war dramas
however, shoot with a
much wider lens and tell
their stories as a series
of episodes in the main
character’s life. American
Sniper and The Hurt
Locker are two examples
of such films; First
They Killed My Father
is another. The film has
no definitive three-act
structure, but instead
rolls along from scene
to scene, portraying the
immense fortitude that
allowed Loung Ung and
her siblings to survive
through the some of the
most trying experiences of
their lives.
We are introduced to
Loung Ung (Sreymoch
Sareum) as a seven-year-
old girl living in a modest
Phnom Penh apartment
with her parents and six
siblings. At the time, her
greatest bother seems to be
whether she can dance as
well as her older brother,
Khouy (Khoun Sothea).
That all changes when a
company of Khmer Rouge
revolutionaries march
into the city and begin a
forcible evacuation. The
Khmer Rouge claim that
the United StatesAir Force
will be bombing the city in
three days, and therefore,
those who wish to survive
must leave immediately.
We see parents carrying
babies in bedsheets, men
throwing luggage onto
carts, and others leaving
with nothing more than the
clothes on their backs. As
Loung’s parents desperate-
ly stuff their suitcases, her
older brother, Meng (Heng
Dara), yells to her “Go and
eat something”, knowing
that they will likely not
have food for several
days. Loung’s parents,
who only moments earlier
seemed as happy as a
honeymooning couple,
are now gripped with
fear as they are marched
along an open highway,
out of the nation’s capital
and into the countryside.
Child soldiers line the
streets with AK-47s in
tow as they yell orders at
the fleeing citizens. Jolie
depicts these scenes from
the perspective of the
young and naïve Loung,
thus injecting them with
a mixture of confusion
and tense uncertainty at
what the future bodes for
this family. Not a single
gunshot is fired through-
out this entire ordeal, but
the frenzied, turbulent and
generally chaotic atmos-
phere perfectly captured
through the eyes of 7-year-
old Loung, leave you in no
doubt as to the brutality of
the Khmer Rouge regime
– the regime infamous for
perpetrating the Cambodi-
an genocide that wiped out
roughly a quarter of the
country’s population.
The film then proceeds
in an episodic fashion,
with each chapter bringing
more challenges than the
last. First, the family must
survive starvation as they
march endlessly along
open roads. Then, after
being taken in by relatives,
they are once again forced
to flee when said relatives
become anxious about
offering shelter to Loung’s
father (played by a humble
and taciturn Phoeung
Kompheak) because he is a
high-ranking government
official and therefore, a
prime target for the hatred
of the Khmer Rouge. After
that, they are captured by a
company of Khmer Rouge
soldiers and sent off to a
labour camp, where they
must fight disease, hunger,
heat and misery to stay
alive. Perhaps the only
thing truly keeping them
alive is the bond they share
with another. But even that
begins to break when three
of Loung’s siblings are led
away by Khmer Rouge
officers, presumably to
a “re-education camp”
where they will be trained
to become child soldiers.
The entire film is
told through the eyes of
7-year-old Loung, but
despite that, her lines are
few enough to fit onto
two sides of A4. This is
because Jolie and Loung
Ung herself, have chosen
to dispense with dialogue
and instead tell the latter’s
story as a sequence of raw
and unfiltered emotional
reactions to the atrocities
that took place around
her. As a result, the film
is an entirely experiential
narrative of how Loung,
and several other children
like her, managed to
survive through one of the
worst genocides in human
history. In the film, Loung
cannot comprehend the
larger meaning of all the
warfare unfolding around
her, and so responds to
it with a kaleidoscopic
mixture of fear and con-
fusion – the reflection
of a desperate attempt to
comprehend a world that
has turned upside down.
This is important, because
as adults viewing the
effects of warfare through
the eyes of a young child,
you begin to see just how
such violence feeds off
the destruction of entire
families and in particular,
how it destroys the lives
of the children who die as
well as those who survive.
Children who were once
innocent and joyful souls,
are indoctrinated with a
fanatical ideology and
inspired to perpetuate
the cycle of violence that
effected the destruction
of their own families.
This is most evident
when towards the end of
the film: Loung, having
escaped the Khmer Rouge,
is given an opportunity to
exact revenge on one of
their captured soldiers.
Her fist clenches and her
jaw tightens, but at the last
moment, she relents and
decides to spare the man
– as do the other refugees
encircling him. A testa-
ment of Loung’s strength
– even as a seven-year-old
– to reject self-indulgent
violence and choose peace
instead.
With First They Killed
My Father, Angelina Jolie
and Loung Ung have put
together a five-star cast
and crafted a tour de force
that is undoubtedly one of
the best films of the year.
Jolie’s decision to focus
on the eyes and raw facial
expressions of Loung
and her siblings, raises a
mirror to boundless cruelty
of the Khmer Rouge,
and paints a captivating
yet agonising portrait
of the devastation that
war inflicts on children.
Loung’s confusion as her
family is driven out of
Phnom Penh; her sorrow
when her father is dragged
away; and her fear when
cautiously navigating a
minefield, earnestly reflect
the endless life-defining
challenges that millions of
Cambodians faced under
the callous savagery of
the Khmer Rouge. First
They Killed My Father is
a tale of intense hardship
and miraculous survival;
a tale that honours both
those who died and those
who survived during the
Cambodian genocide. It
is a strikingly honest and
visceral account of a story
that needs to be heard,
and one that hopefully,
will inspire others to tell
similarly important stories
in the future.
First They Killed My Father
has been selected as the
official Cambodian entry
for “Best Foreign Language
Film” at the 90th Academy
Awards, and is currently
streaming on Netflix.

FIRST THEY KILLED
MY FATHER
Barry Lyndon: Stanley Kubrick’s greatest masterpiece
Savaged by critics upon its release, Barry Lyndon deserves to be respected for the visual and philosophical
masterpiece that it is
FILM
Michael Purdy
Film Editor
U
pon release,
Barry Lyndon
was met with
intense scorn
from some critics: Pauline
Kael described it as a
“coffee-table movie” and
others called it dry, boring,
and empty. They were
wrong. Barry Lyndon is a
visual and philosophical
masterpiece that, in my
eyes, is Stanley Kubrick’s
greatest work.
Adapted from a 19th
century novel, Barry
Lyndon follows the rise
and fall of Redmond
Barry, a young Irish man
of humble origins who
marries into an English
aristocratic family. At the
beginning Barry is forced
to join the British army
and fight in the Seven
Years’ War, but he deserts
the British and joins the
Prussian army. After
fleeing Prussia, Barry
obtains large amounts of
wealth through crooked
gambling and consequent-
ly woos and marries an
English aristocrat, Lady
Lyndon, thereby adopting
the name ‘Barry-Lyn-
don’. He spends all the
noble family’s money on
alcohol, gambling, and
expensive artwork, and
is ultimately exiled after
losing a leg in a duel to his
stepson.
Kirk Douglas’ char-
acter in both Spartacus
and Paths of Glory is a
hero driven by idealistic
motives, and we can
resolutely say that he is
morally sound. Humbert
Humbert in Lolita and
Barry-Lyndon, however,
is Kubrick’s most
thought-provoking and
complicated character: it
is extremely difficult to
form a resounding opinion
about his character as our
perception and attitude
towards him changes
frequently and with great
intensity throughout the
film. Kubrick attempts to
manipulate our perception
of Barry using two simple
yet ingenious techniques.
Firstly, a narrator
constantly depicts Barry
in a cold and narcissistic
light; he implies that
Barry lies and deceives
to fulfil self-aggrandising
motives such as when he
over-spends the Lyndon
family money to gain
a title. However, Barry
is only deceptive when
attempting to survive
and achieve acceptance
from his peers – from the
beginning of the film he is
an isolated character who
craves intimacy and is
forced to commit immoral
acts to achieve this.
Secondly, the camera is
repeatedly positioned from
the view point of those
who surround Barry. We
are encouraged to adopt
the perception of the aris-
tocrats who look upon the
protagonist as an outsider
who is not worthy of ac-
ceptance. Kubrick tries his
best to invite us into the
world that rejects Barry,
but coincidently arouses
deep feelings of sympathy
by displaying Barry as an
outcast involved in a series
of ill-fated outcomes. The
very name, “Barry-Lyn-
don”, illustrates the du-
plicity and lack of identity
of the protagonist: he is
both Irish and English,
rough and sophisticated,
poor and rich.
Kubrick masterly
employed modern special
effects in 2001: A Space
Odyssey – no other film at
the time could create such
elegant and mesmerising
portrayals of outer-space
– and while the “war-
room” in Dr. Strangelove
is a relatively simple set,
every shot was dramatic,
unnerving, and at times
humorous. Kubrick’s
films all involve incredi-
ble camera-work, but the
aesthetically spectacular
Barry Lyndon is visually
superior to all others.
The grandiose and ornate
rooms of the palaces in
Barry Lyndon are depicted
as dark and lifeless, in
contrast to the shots of
rural Ireland, Germany,
and England, which are
portrayed as sun-blessed
agrarian paradises. This
skilfully illustrates the
contrast between the
simple, yet naturally beau-
tiful, life Barry was born
into and the detached, cold
life of which he craved to
become a part. Kubrick
refused to use artificial
light on set and the only
illumination came from
candle-light; this, coupled
with frequently motionless
shots, created scenes rem-
iniscent of an 18th
century
oil painting. The camera
is briskly taken from the
tripod during periods of
violence, such as when
Barry brutally flogs his
stepson in the Lyndon
estate, highlighting how
quickly civility can shift
to barbarism.
By creating the
monolith in 2001, Kubrick
portrayed the universe as
a Godless vacuum that is
controlled by an ambigu-
ous mystical force. These
concepts of godlessness
and mysticism are again
reintroduced into the
world of Barry Lyndon but
in a much subtler respect.
The very first scene shows
Barry’s father dying in a
duel, and thus throughout
the film Barry lacks the
omnipresent support and
comfort that is associated
with having a father or
having a God. Barry’s life
events are so extraordinary
that it impossible they
happen by coincidence:
there may not be a God
present in Barry’s world
but there is unquestiona-
bly a supernatural force
pulling strings in the
background.
18th
century Europe
was a tumultuous and
rapidly changing place.
The French Revolution
was about to give birth to
the concepts of equality,
fraternity, and liberty
which would create the
opportunity for common
man to obtain a share of
high society’s wealth.
Barry possibly represents
Kubrick’s belief that this
opportunity was a fallacy,
and if an 18th
century
common man searched for
wealth they would end up
isolated, detached and – in
the director’s own words –
“cut adrift in a rudderless
boat on an uncharted sea.”
“Redmond
Barry-
Lyndon is
Kubrick’s most
complicated
character”
Alex in A Clockwork
Orange may be humorous
and charming, but they are
sociopaths driven by their
instincts to commit pro-
foundly disturbing acts,
and it is easy to conclude
that they are morally
corrupt people. Redmond
