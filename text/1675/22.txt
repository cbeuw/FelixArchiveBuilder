One of the oldest
clubs at Imperial, IC Rail
and Transport Society
(ICRTS) has always been
intrinsically linked to the
college’s original purpose
of educating future
engineers to build and
maintain the Empire, prin-
cipally through railways.
Nowadays, it fosters close
links with operational and
engineering leaders of the
modern transport industry.
Through regular talks and
workshops with the heads
of this UK domain, such
IC CHEERLEADING
SAVE THE CHEER-
LEADERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make sure you head
over to Embargos next
Wednesday night for our
annual Save the Cheer-
leader event! Running
10pm-2am, all imperial
and non imperial students
welcome!
This is our annual fund-
raising event, where all
the money we raise goes
towards sending us to our
national competition in
the spring term. There will
be lots of drinks deals on,
with tickets only £7!!! Join
the event on Facebook for
more details. Last year we
placed 2nd out of 13 teams
at nationals and we’re
ready to bring the gold
home this season.
Already our freshers
are super keen, we’ve had
over half the team turn up
at our strength and con-
ditioning sessions, which
run on Monday nights
9-10:30pm (are your
members this committed?)
And our stunts are literally
flying through the roof.
We’ve also got an Insta-
gram account running this
year (@ICTitansCheer)
– we take it way more se-
riously than our personal
ones and post anything
and everything from
training right through to
sports night so make sure
to check it out, or even
better come join us at the
union every Wednesday!

opportunity for a group
of four friends to take
part in our new upcoming
programme – Can We
Have a Chat? – where you

few sips of wine, and have
a chat based on a series
of questions on a given
topic that week (i.e. love).
The show allows people
to have open and honest
conversations about topics
that might seem ordinary

as the Permanent Way In-
stitute, we remain abreast
of the key issues affecting
the transport networks we
all rely on. As a member
of ICRTS, you can visit
working depots around the
country, test-drive modern
trains on simulators like
during our Aylesbury
Chiltern Railways depot
trip, and get hands-on
experience renovating
part of a working railway
with our track-laying trips
to the Welsh Highlands.
There are few other so-
cieties able to offer such
front-line access to the
industry; invaluable to
those thinking of a future
career in the field. Many
of our events look back
at History through visits
up the Queen’s Tower and
to the London Transport
Museum. This year, our
Wales trip will be from
the 15th to 18th December
and will offer a packed
3-days of renovating part
of the Ffestiniog railway, a
heritage steam engine line
of great regional touristic
interest. For under £50,
accommodation, travel,
and food are provided to
members for the duration
the trip. To not miss out
on our tailored events,
feel free to take up mem-
bership, follow us on
Facebook, and request to
be on the mailing list!
but have a profound
impact on people’s lives.
They get to explore how
they really feel and what
they really think about
certain issues. It is a space
where a group of friends
can share their thoughts
and feelings, get to know
their differences in beliefs,
and realise some things
that they might not have
realised if they hadn’t had
the conversation.
Each week we’ll be on
the lookout for a new set
of faces, so the door will
always be open for you
and your friends to join
– just drop us an email at
ictv@imperial.ac.uk with
your names and courses.
ICRTS enjoying some railway fun! // Owen Harcombe (ICRTS)
