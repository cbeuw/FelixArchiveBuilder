Metric crowds prompt fear of serious harm

afety concerns
have been raised
in relation to the
number of people
attending Metric at peak
times. Students have
reported annoyance over
a lack of crowd control
and properly trained
staff, particularly at
special events and ACC
nights. The Union, how-
ever, disputes claims
that Metric is unsafe.
A source told Felix that
they had “fairly often”
witnessed people being
crushed or stuck inside
for 15 minutes due to
lack of movement. They
also reported that people
had been brought to tears
by the “stressful” events.
Felix understands that
these claims are supported
by photographic evidence.
The Union said: “There
have been no reports of
any injuries in Metric or
any other Imperial College
Union spaces relating to
crowding.” However, stu-
dents have spoken to Felix
about accidents that have
occurred.
One student, Liam, told
Felix about a particularly
bad incident. He joined
the queue to enter Metric
on a sports night last year.
Two security guards – one
swelled as more people
joined the queue without
anybody being able to
enter or exit Metric. Stu-
dents asked the security
guards to open the fire
doors in Metric, but were
told that staff did not have
the key.
“After a few minutes of
people shoving past me, I
started to get crushed. It
wasn’t too bad but I could
no longer raise my arms
above my head,” Liam
said.
“Then I noticed a girl
very near to the doors
starting to get really
crushed. She was saying
she couldn’t breathe. The
security guard witnessed
this but did nothing.”
As the crowd tried to
push its way into Metric,
the girl fell. Liam asked
a student closer to the girl
to help her up but they
refused, saying it was “not
my problem”. Again, the
security guard was unable
to act.
Liam stepped forward,
yelling at people to move.
He managed to grab the
girl and drag her outside.
“I think she had
fainted,” Liam said. “Once
we were outside she was
hysterical.”
The Union told Felix
that there was no risk of
any harm at Metric. A
statement from a Union
representative said: “At
peak times of busy eve-
nings, clear procedures are
in place to manage tempo-
rary congestion. Trained
