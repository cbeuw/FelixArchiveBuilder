I Herts Lacrosse 3.0: Fresher’s Tournament
T
he University
of Hertfordshire
Lacrosse club
hosted a tour-
nament to get freshers
playing lacrosse, giving
them a lot more game
time and allowing them to
develop their sticks skills.
How else would you spend
your Sunday? Playing
lacrosse of course!
The Men’s 2s gathered
at around midday, ready to
grab their sticks and take
the banter-filled minibus
up to Hertfordshire.
Having forgotten the
cold rains of Saturday’s
training, the squad de-
scended upon the pitch
and set themselves up
against their first oppo-
nents in their league of
five: UEA. After bagging
the equaliser for the 2s in
his previous BUCS game,
Khris Delizo marked his
return to the lacrosse pitch
by scoring twice against
UEA, winning us our
first game. The victories
followed quickly: another
win against Warwick, with
Mike McGill scoring his
first goal of the season,
and Khris backing himself
we held Brunel to a draw.
One may argue that these
victories were a result of
our two coaches Ben Reed
and Ross Unwin, players
from the Men’s 1s who
came to see how the 2s
have progressed so far in
their first month.
With a speed gun
handed over to the men,
it was only natural that
we would stroke our
egos, having smashed our
league, and compete to see
who had the fastest shot.
Ben proved he had
the fastest shot with an
89-mph shot and the 2s
resident shot maniac,
Khris came second with
an 80-mph shot.
The time had come –
unbeknownst to the Men’s
2s, this semi-final would
be their final game of the
day. But against the might
of the home team, the
Hertfordshire Comets, the
Men’s 2s put up a valiant
effort. There were some
amazing checks from the
fresher long pole Sebastia
Ramon, who is shaping
up to quickly steal the
club spot of best d-pole,
and quality dodges from
Charles Ingham as he
gracefully dodged the
opposition’s defence. Matt
Cowley also stepped up
to be our face off and get
off (FOGO) champ as he
stepped up to do the face-
off.
With the day drawing
to a close, the skies were
alight with fireworks,
brightening up the night
sky as the Men’s 2s
returned to London, filled
with the pride of their
victories and the drive
to smash the rest of their
season.
Women’s Lacrosse at the Jan Kiddle Cup
T
he Jan Kiddle
cup is a develop-
ment tournament
aimed at players
just starting out at lacrosse,
encouraging improved
stick skills and game play.
In the early hours of
Saturday, 4th
November
stood a crowd of lacrosse
freshers, ready to smash
the day ahead. Morale
started out low as we
arrived in muddy Hitchin
with torrential rain. But as
the tournament began, the
weather was forgotten and
lacrosse was the only thing
on our minds. Our first
game against Kent saw
first-time goals from many
of our freshers – leading
to a glorious 3-2 victory!
The matches following
are a little unclear, as the
adrenaline and excitement
of each game fogged the
memory. After our initial
victory, we won another
game, drew one and lost
one – making it into the
semi-finals!
The final five minutes
in our semi-final game
against Kent was one of
our most intense plays to
date. The desire for victory
was clear. With only a
couple minutes remaining,
a phenomenal goal from
our fresher secured our
place in the final against
Central London.
The final game against
Central London was the
best both freshers and
seniors had played in a
long while. Our defence
boxed out the other team
for the entire match,
leading to overtime, then
golden goal. Eventually
the strain of an entire day
of lacrosse hit and our wall
cracked, letting Central
London take the cup.
As the day ended, the
skies lit up as brightly
as our smiles. It was
a phenomenal day of
lacrosse, which saw such
an improvement in game
play and stick skills
alike from all players.
A massive shout-out to
Hitchin for such a fantas-
tic day, the other teams for

L
ast Wednesday
saw a grudge
match for the
first team against
their old foe Brunel. After
two close losses last
season, the squad was in
the mood for revenge.
Kicking off at a delayed
time of 15:00, the match
started perfectly: a re-
claimed kick off, followed
by a barrelling run by
resident sleeve-stretcher
Martin Head, led to us
making quick inroads into
the Brunel half. Several
phases of linking play
later and Marin Tuleu
went over in the corner.
With Field adding the
extras, we were 7-0 up.
However, we could not
maintain the high work
rate and were soon back
defending in our own half.
Brunel’s wide attacking
play was proving effective
in piercing our line, and
after some forward pod
phases they whipped the
ball out and went over in
the corner. The kick was
good, and we were all
level. At this point Brunel
hit their stride, and the
last 20 minutes of the half
went in such a manner
best not described here, or
at least not by me. Let’s
just say that, as half-time
arrived, Brunel had built
up a 21-7 lead, and we
were not happy.
What followed was the
grittiest half of rugby the
1st XV has played in many
a match. 20 minutes of the
second half went by and
Brunel didn’t have a single
phase of possession. The
line-outs were firing on
all cylinders, the driving
mauls were tearing them
apart, and the backs were
interlinking perfectly.
With the constant thought
of maintaining his wavy
locks with curl cream
no longer on his mind,
captain-of-the-bench
Allingham burrowed over
from short range for a
classic front-row-union
try. Marin dotted down for
his second before Brunel
finally got the ball back.
At this point, the tries
were flowing, and Brunel
attempted to reassert their
hold on the match with a
converted try followed by
a penalty. They led 31-21.
However, the momentum
remained with us; DPFS
Blackett, spurred on by
his indignation at the
hate he has received for
the introduction of Bud
Light, sniped around the
ruck and went over. 31-26.
Several minutes later and
a peel from the back of
a mall saw Will Aynsley
bust over the line. With
the conversion, we now
led 33-31. However, it
was not to be. A late try
down the blindside, com-
pounded by a last-play
interception try by Brunel
saw them snatch it away
from us, final score 43-33.
So close but yet so far.

O
n the 20th
of
October, the
Imperial wind-
surfing Team
adventured to the confined
lands of Devon to partici-
pate in the biggest Student
Windsurfing Festival
of the year: the Student
Windsurfing Association’s
Aussie Kiss!
Everything looked
perfect – 360 windsurfers
from all over the UK were
about and ready to go. But
it wasn’t until we got there
on Friday night that we
realised just how muddy
and windy it was – a classic
British camping weekend.
But the big party tent was
ready and so were we! The
night was starting to get
energized and the team
were enjoying themselves,
but it was an early-ish
bedtime as the forecast for
the weekend was BIG.
Saturday morning, we
rigged up the kit up and
donned our wetsuits. The
wind was howling and
gusting at 40 knots, with
the forecast only set to
get worse. Everyone was
hyped, and suitably scared
for their lives, but the team
went out and had some fun
in a rather windy lake. We
could see windsurf freesty-
lers spinning and turning
and landing moves, mi-
raculously keeping their
feet on the board. Unfor-
tunately, the tents were not
doing so great in Storm
Brian and half the team
were preparing to sleep in
the minibus. This was not
going to stop us – we came
here to windsurf!
The day ended without
casualties and with big
smiles on very tired faces
as we headed to the local
pub to dry up a bit. We
knew it was going to
be a rough night on the
campsite with many tents
blown down. But after
drying up we were ready
to get on the fancy dress
and head to the main party
tent. This year the theme
was Sweet 16: Spoiled
Rotten. The team always
likes to be noticed and
certain (male) members
looked dashing in some
dresses! We celebrated
and partied like there was
no tomorrow, happily in
denial that Sunday existed.
Come the last day, com-
petition time. The wind
was not as extreme as
Saturday, although people
were quite happily blasting
along. The Imperial
Advance Racing Team,
consisting of Horacio Cox,
Raph Zufferey, and Alix
Fouche, took to the water
and completed their heat
in second place, but did
not make the final. Finally,
the freestyle racing took
place, unfortunately
without any big planing
moves as the wind didn’t
pick up.
All in all, it was a
fantastic (and quite wet)
weekend; a fantastic start
to Imperial’s windsurfing
season!!
If you want to get
involved (no prior expe-
rience needed), on the
24th
-26th
of November
the Team are heading to
Liverpool to compete in
beginner, intermediate,
advance and team racing.
Tuition is also available
for all abilities. For more
