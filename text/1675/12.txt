In the words of a young poet finding her feet

W
hat do we
know of
s o m e o n e
else’s life,
besides what they choose
to reveal to us? What more
of a life that was tragically
cut short, and has remained
an enigma since?
In a newly-published
tome of never-before-seen
letters by 20th
-century
poet Sylvia Plath, we
steal glimpses of a young,
gifted poet in the making,
and the window through
which she saw the world.
These letters published in
the first volume cover the
letters written from the
time Plath was seven years
old, to her marriage to
Ted Hughes in 1956. The
second volume, covering
her marriage and separa-
tion, up to her death, is due
next autumn.
As part of the recent-
ly-concluded London
Literature Festival at the
Southbank Centre, four
writers gathered on stage
to discuss the new letters,
a selection of which was
read by Lydia Wilson.
The letters read ranged
from the first one written
to her mother when Plath
was seven, observing the
differences in writing
with different coloured
pens, to the one detailing
the events surrounding
her first suicide attempt
at 20, up to several letters
describing how deeply
in love she was with Ted
Hughes.
The event was chaired
by writer Lavinia
Greenlaw, and she was
joined by writers Eimear
McBride, Max Porter, and
Sarah Howe. The writers
took turns to discuss
the letters, giving their
personal takes on what
they thought the letters
revealed, and how they
were relevant to Plath as a
poet. Each writer then read
their favourite work of
Plath’s, which turned out
to be a beautiful juxtaposi-
tion of her literary output
with the epistolary form.
The evening was
opened with a speech by
Plath’s daughter Frieda
Hughes, the special guest
at the event. Reading
from her foreword to
the volume, Ms Hughes
pointed out the irony that
her father has been blamed
and criticised throughout
history for her mother’s
death, considering that
he chose to publish the
collection of poetry, Ariel,
that would make Plath
famous, out of a “moral
duty” to the brilliance of
her work.
That all her letters
in this period has been
published unabridged
into a huge tome running
at a whopping 1424
pages, is a testament
to the high public and
academic interest in her
life. These volumes aim
to be a complete, unedited
collection of Plath’s
letters – a significant effort
considering that most of
her work was published
posthumously, edited by
the various people close
to her, including Hughes
and her mother. Ariel, for
example, was edited and
published by Hughes after
her death, and controversy
has always surrounded
his choice of poems to
include. An earlier volume
of letters was published by
her mother, but was put
down by critics as being
testament to the efforts of
an overbearing mother,
whom Plath, they sug-
gested, struggled to free
herself from.
Against this backdrop
of strong public and
academic interest, The
Letters of Sylvia Plath:
Volume 1 seems to rebel
against her cultural image,
and instead focus on her
young, developing voice,
one that reveals a maturity
of thought and observation
while dealing with the
regular events of youth.
This volume only hints at
the more major events of
her life and her matured
poetic voice – aspects that
are likely to be the focus
of the second volume.
In a way, this first
volume seems to normal-
ise the young Plath and
provide us with some
insight into her developing
personality and how it
might have contributed to
the tragic trajectory of her
life.
From the letters, we find
the voice of an ambitious
young writer, eager to
make it in the world, and
determined to do all she
can to succeed. The dark
side of this drive, however,
is the self-criticism, the
high expectations, and
the inability to cope with
perceived failure. This
was obviously a young
lady who was aware of her
potential, and uncompro-
mising in her standards.
It reminded me greatly of
her novel The Bell Jar,
which, of course, is based
on her own experiences.
Among these more
serious issues, however,
were more light-hearted
letters, such as ones
describing how miserable
English weather was,
written home when she
was on a Fulbright schol-
arship at Cambridge. Ap-
parently, Plath also found
the teeth of British men
appalling.
Letters are intimate
– they are written for a
specific audience, and
can reveal the writer’s
innermost thoughts
and emotions, giving
us glimpses of their
inner lives. But they are
also performances in
themselves, a selective
distillation of one’s life
and contemplation into
crafted pieces that carry
across a particular way the
writer wants to be seen. It
is evident even within the
selection of letters read
during the evening that
Plath became increasing-
ly adept at shaping her
written persona.
One never learns about
Plath’s writing without
learning something
about her history and
cultural dominance as
well. Her image has been
mythologised, beatified,
demonised, and altogether
sensationalised across
time. If this book does one
thing, it is to hopefully
restore some balance to
her story, and include her
voice in the events of her
life that have captured the
public imagination.
New volume of Plath’s complete letters reveals the mind of a young poet hungry for success

The koala bear as a metaphor for life, death, and the
struggle to survive
Swiss writer Lukas Bärfuss tackles issues of mortality and the meaning of life in his third novel Koala
BOOKS
Clemens Jakubec
Books Writer
T
he animal was
not black. It was
not strong. It
was lazy and had
furry ears, a creature, that
people laughed about. The
best one could say about
the animal was, that it
was cute.” The koala is
usually not an animal that
people tend to spend a lot
of time thinking about.
Nevertheless, swiss author
Lukas Bärfuss decided to
put it in the center of his
latest novel Koala, for
which he was awarded the
Swiss Book Prize in 2014.
It tells the story of an
author who tries to deal
with the suicide of his
brother. Although they
had not been very close,
his brother’s sudden death
strikes him as something
incomprehensible. He
travels to his hometown,
which he left many years
ago, in order to talk to his
brother’s friends and to
make sense of what has
happened. In his memories
he travels back to their
childhood. They grew up
in separate families with
the only thing they had
in common being their
mother. He recalls how
during their teenage years
at a scout camp his brother
was given a nickname:
Koala. The name that
would prove to be an
omen for the rest of his
brother’s life.
The storyline then takes
the reader back in time, to
a period when the people
in North America started
to fight for their independ-
ence and the British began
to colonise Australia. The
book gives an account
of the first settlement of
British criminals who
were sent to Australia,
their hopes and fears, their
successes and struggles.
And amidst all of this
runs the story of the Koala
– the story of an animal
that lived unchanged and
undisturbed for millions
of years until the first
humans arrived and began
to hunt it.
Bärfuss’s precise and
eloquent style, combined
with the usage of short
sentences with very few
adjectives makes it a
relatively easy read. He
does not waste words on
lengthy descriptions, but
rather sticks to simple
structures. Nevertheless,
“It drags the
reader out of
his comfort
zone and
forces him to
face a lot of
uncomfortable
issues of life”
none of this diminishes
the message he tries to
convey. In fact, boiling the
story down to its essence
appears to make it even
more striking.
Bärfuss uses the
history of the koala as a
magnificent metaphor for
our lives or rather for the
meaning of life in general.
He is not afraid to tackle
the big questions. In his
1942 essay The Myth of
Sisyphus French Nobel
Prize winnerAlbert Camus
comments that whoever
attempts to explore the
ultimate meaning of our
lives must inevitably deal
with all the discoveries he
or she makes, regardless
of whether or not they are
pleasant or not. This is
exactly what Bärfuss does.
He bravely ventures into a
realm that many people
prefer to leave untouched
and he confronts the reader
with all the consequences.
One of the taboos
Bärfuss addresses openly
is suicide. The main char-
acter in the book cannot
accept the suicide of his
brother for an almost
selfish reason. He is a
famous and accomplished
author living a fulfilling
life, so it is not only
incomprehensible for him
how anybody can commit
suicide, but it actually
upsets him and makes him
angry, as if his brother
would have been under
some kind of obligation
to stay alive, so as not to
perturb the protagonist’s
perfect life. On the other
hand, he also experiences
how the people surround-
ing him deal with the loss.
When the conversation
shifts to the suicide most
of them fall silent. They
feel uncomfortable and try
to feel better by pretend-
ing that nothing has ever
happened.
The centrepiece of the
novel, however, is the
koala. A koala does not
live what most people
would call an interesting
life. It spends the majority
of its time sleeping, it
hardly moves, and is not
considered to be highly
intelligent, not unlike the
protagonist’s brother. He
is unemployed, has never
left his hometown, and
smokes a lot of weed.
Yet the main character
comes to realise that there
is essentially nothing
that makes his life, a life
governed by career goals
and productivity inherent-
ly superior to a “wasted”
life like the one lived by
the protagonist’s brother.
Towards the end of the
book he thinks: “The cure
for fear is industriousness.
The one who is ambitious
needs a pair of good legs
and all those who want to
be ambitious but do not
have them, must explain
themselves. Only the
strong ones are able.” By
fear he means the fear of
being forgotten after death.
Productivity and ambition
are the cure prescribed by
society. However, they
tend to be used as distrac-
tions rather than solutions.
Another way out of the
misery, he realises, is
laziness. Laziness just
exists and is not bothered
by the petty little problems
of everyday existence.
In a time when people
are more and more
focussed on their careers,
stress and mental health
problems are on the rise,
and society becomes
generally more compet-
itive, this sends a strong
signal. It drags the reader
out of their comfort zone
and forces them to face a
lot of the uncomfortable
issues of life. Whoever
Swiss author of German-language novel Koala, Lukas Bärfuss // Wikimedia
decides to read this book
can be sure to be left with
a lot of answers and even
more questions in the end
– unpleasant questions,
but ones that everybody
should try to answer for
themselves at some point.
“One of the
taboos Bärfuss
addresses
openly in Koala
is suicide”
