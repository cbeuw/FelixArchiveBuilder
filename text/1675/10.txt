IMPRESSIONISTS IN
LONDON
W
ith the news
fixed on the
movement
of refugees
in Europe, the Tate has
turned to an earlier period
in the continent’s history
when war and political
instability caused a surge
of migration into London.
Brexit in their crosshairs,
the curators preface
the new exhibition on
Impressionists with the
pointed: “these artists
faced no entrance restric-
tions; anyone, regardless
of nationality, could come
and stay indefinitely”.
This seems to be a mas-
terclass in preaching to
the choir; few diehard
proponents of Brexit are
likely to be persuaded by
the Tate’s history lesson.
Nevertheless, the works
the curators have put
together provide a fasci-
nating narrative on the
French artists who came
to London as refugees
and how the experience
shaped their work.
It would be a mistake
to consider this exhibition
as revision of art history
canon: it doesn’t claim,
and rightfully so, that it
was London smog, not
the French countryside,
that birthed Impression-
ism, instead it frames
the collected works as a
pictorial ‘Notes from a
Small Island’: giants of
Impressionism shining a
(mostly) flattering light on
the British landscape with
their outsider’s eye.
Pissaro is a particu-
lar highlight, his deft
brushstrokes elevate a
snow covered street in
Sydenham to a glittering
idyll. In another, a steam
Hampton is transfixing;
a explosion of pointillist
green. These parochial,
peaceful scenes are placed
in sharp contrast to Siebe
Johannes Ten Cate’s
paintings of Paris burning.
In La Place du Carrousel
: The Ruins of Tuileries,
strong lines of duck egg
blue and deep burnt sienna
collide on the canvas
evoking the acrid smell of
smoke and a biting winter
chill.
Elsewhere James
Jacques Joseph Tissot, not
strictly an Impressionist,
but one of the French
artists who settled in
London following the
Franco-Prussian war,
turns his keen caricatur-
ist’s’ eye to English high
society. His canvases, far
from mocking (as he was
sometimes accused of
being) cast a humanising,
gently teasing eye over
the Victorians and their
famous stiff upper lips.
His work is richly, often
amusingly detailed: in
Too Early figures leans
against the doorway awk-
wardly having gotten to a
party before it’s started,
their faces frozen in a
grimace of social anxiety,
in another painting, this
one of a violin concert, a
young woman, carefully
expressionless, eyes
glazing over, sinks into
a chaise longue, body
disappearing into a swathe
of bows.
Despite the prominence
placed on the artist in
the Tate’s advertising for
the exhibition, Monet
takes up relatively little
space in the gallery. In
Leicester Square at Night
a storm of slashes of deep
ultramarine and indigo
are intercut with vibrant
lemon yellows and tange-
rines and ceruleans, it was
painted in 1901 but could
just as well be last night.
The beauty of Monet’s
canvases of London seem
tantalizingly close. Step
out of the Tate at sunset
have slight modulations
of perspective and colour:
whorls of dusky plum melt
into violet, mustard, peach
and scarlet, in each the sun
burns fiercely, each glows
with an inner light. For
all the fervour of Monet’s
vision of the Thames, the
most powerful depictions
of the river belong to
Whistler.
In the series Nocturne:
Blue and Silver, Whistler
paints the Cremorne
Lights, Old Battersea
Bridge, and Chelsea in
washes of ultramarine.
Layers of the palest,
loveliest blues and greys
meld into each other,
wavering droplets of gold
represent the lights on the
distant shore. Oscar Wilde
summed up the visceral
power of Whistler’s
work with characteristic
flair: “to whom if not to
Whistler do we owe these
silver mists that brood
over our river. There
may have been fogs for
centuries... but no one saw
them... they did not exist
till art invented them”.
Standing in front of these
quiet deeply intense paint-
ings I felt the same sense
of magic I sometimes feel
walking home alone late
at night, the same magic
Virginia Woolf conjures
up in the opening pages
of Mrs Dalloway as she
describes the capital
waking up: London for all
its famous bustle is often
its most seductive when
the crowds have left.
It’s a pity then that
Whistler doesn’t feature
more heavily, a greater
shame that the contribu-
tion of British artists to
Impressionism, particular-
ly that of J.M.W Turner is
left unexplored. At times
the curation feels a bit
too focused on the artists’
statuses as French emigres
than the nature of their
work; as a love letter to
the London of the time
however, it is marvellous.

I
f weeks had themes,
the theme of last
week would’ve been
empowerment. On
Wednesday I ventured
down into Imperial’s
Enterprise Labs as part
of the WE Innovate
scheme and met dozens
of inspiring, amazingly
ambitious women just
at the beginning of their
careers desperate to make
a difference in the world.
On Sunday, slightly
further afield, in the
People’s Palace – a part of
Queen Mary’s – I met an
equally amazing group of
women assembled for the
TedxUCL Women lineup.
The theme for this year,
the fourth iteration of the
TEDxUCL Women format
was ‘home’ - a subject
that each of the speakers
explored with a different
lens. For Dr Olesya
Myakonkaya, ‘home’
meant looking beyond the
reaches of our planet and
considering how the future
of human colonisation on
Mars (an event she con-
siders inevitable) could
go beyond technology for
technology’s sake. Similar
themes of humanist de-
velopment were explored
later by Shelley Sacks.
Sacks, a ‘social sculptor’,
spoke movingly of her
childhood in apartheid
South Africa, and the rift
the racial division created
in her early life, even sit-
uations as banal as dinner
time. Using the example
of their family kitchen
in which these tensions
would boil over, Sacks
spoke on the theme of
imagining a future where
ingrained biases are chal-
lenged and overcome.
Halima Hussain
explained how the trans-
formative experience
of participating in a
mixed-gender prayer
behind a female imam
broke down her precon-
ceptions what a Muslim
prayer could look like.
Following this, Hussain, a
theologian with an interest
in feminist readings of the
Quran, founded the In-
clusive Mosque Initiative
(IMI) with Dervla Shan-
nahan and Tamsila Tauqir.
Hussain described IMI as a
place where inclusion, re-
gardless of gender, sexual
orientation, or disability is
at the forefront of religious
practice. In one of the most
powerful moments of the
day, Hussain decried the
media’s propensity to pit
IMI against the more tra-
ditional interpretations of
in Subhadra Das’ witty,
passionate talk. Das, a
historian and curator of
the Francis Galton collec-
tion at the UCL Pathology
and Science Collections,
spoke about exposing the
racist history of UCL – an
institution essential to the
establishment of eugenics
as an accepted science in
Britain in the 19th
century,
and a place Das considers
home after spending the
vast majority of her adult
life there, first as a student,
then as an educator.
Quoting Robert Frost she
said “I used to consider
home as a place they had
to take you in... [but now]
I like to say home is the
place, when I got there, I
tried to make better”.
TED talks as a format
are so popular and so
engaging because it is a
chance to gain a primer
into a complex subject
within a few minutes, the
brevity proved a curse
as well as a blessing
on Sunday however. I
could’ve easily listened to
another hour of the play-
wright Jules Orco who
spoke with verve about
negotiating the London
arts scene as a Filipino
woman and the impor-
tance of recognising that
mere representation – as
difficult as it is to achieve
– is useless without real
and actual power: there’s
no point having a seat at
the table if you cannot
the shape the discussion.
Where Orco shone,
the format completely
obscured the brilliance of
other speakers – Ashleigh
Boyd who was presenting
her own stem cell research
post-it notes where dele-
gates were encouraged to
write their own definition,
the descriptions varied
from the single word
“doggies :)” to “the place
in which your existence
need not be justified”.
On a day where the talks
were truly intersectional,
centered just as much on
race, religion, and econom-
ics as on feminism, where
the speakers spoke pas-
sionately, movingly about
how their experiences has
shaped their worldview, I
kept thinking of a line from
Little Gidding: “the end of
all our exploring / Will be
to arrive where we started
/ And know the place for
the first time”. Home, so
inextricably linked to our
childhood seemed to be
a thing always changing:
albeit with a constant,
“home,” said Grace
Victory during her spoken
word performance, ges-
turing towards herself “is
this – home is me”.
In giving women from
all different fields and
viewpoints a platform,
the TEDxUCL Women
team are doing something
worthwhile, something
essential: long may they
continue.
“Home was
a subject
that each of
the speakers
explored with
a different
lens”
Islam and extended a hand
of solidarity to her Muslim
sisters who choose not
embrace IMI’s ideals -
“women who do not want
to pray behind women
imams are not in need of
reform... plenty of strong
women and feminism
exists in the spaces of our
parents”.
Hussain’s quiet revolu-
tion borne out of love for
a community was echoed
“The speakers
spoke about
how their life
experiences
had shaped
their world
view”
for treatment of diabetes
had barely gotten past
explaining what diabetes
was and its devastating
impact before her time
was up.
