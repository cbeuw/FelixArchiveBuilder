Money for muffin: Café to replace Central Library

a haven for muffins.

F
elix has gained
access to the
College’s plans
for the Central
Library renovation,
which show a number of
previously undisclosed
changes.
The College reported
that the building work,
which has been going on
throughout the summer,
was purportedly to install
air conditioning following
the tragic incident last
year in which three fresh-
ers became incredibly
dehydrated. However,
Felix can reveal that the
true purpose is to increase
the size of the Library
Café, which will cover all
five floors of the Central
Library once it reopens in
2018.
We spoke to Hamish
Rhys, Vice Provost
(Taste Imperial Campus
Integration), who said that
the College “regretted”
that these plans were
leaked, saying that they
had wanted to “save the
news until just before the
National Student Survey
opened”. When asked
about the rationale behind
the changes, he said “we
carried out some research
on Central Library over the
academic year 2015/16,
and found that nobody
was actually carrying out
anything even remotely
approaching productive
work. Therefore, we
thought that the best thing
to do would be to open a
new Library Café Deluxe,
since – let’s face it – the
JCR is pretty grim at the
moment.”
What is currently the
Library Cafe will become
a staff room for the
expanded Library Cafe
team, which has absorbed
the library services
employees. One former
librarian we spoke to said
that she was “surprised”
that after 30 years of
carefully ensuring the
Dewey decimal system
was followed, she would
have to retrain as a barista,
but admitted that she was
excited to get the recipe
for the library café’s red
velvet cheesecake.
One student we spoke
biology fresher, told Felix
that “the time when I get
the most work done in
the library is when I’m
waiting for my paninis to
be toasted. When I return
to my desk I usually just
scroll Facebook, text my
friends, and think about
the slow heat death of the
universe until it’s time to
go home.”
Some students were
upset about the move,
however. One student we
spoke to called the plans
“ridiculous”, saying that
“Imperial has the space
and the money to open up
this huge vanity project,
but whenever we ask for
more resources to the
counselling services we’re
told they’re not available.
It’s complete bullshit.”
Café as far as the eye can see... // Thomas Angus
Rhys responded to the
comment, saying “Im-
perial College London
are fully committed to
the mental wellbeing
of its students, which is
why we’re increasing the
muffin options available
in our catering outlets. We
are sure this change will
have more effect that any
counsellors could.”
The new cafe will span
over the entire Central
Library building, provid-
ing seating for approx-
imately 2,000 students.
A whole floor will be
dedicated to a new Fusion
54 outlet, which should
ease the queue burden on
campus, and the top floor
will offer “a unique dining
experience” with views
over Queen’s Lawn. It will
not offer cooked breakfast.
“The College
wanted to wait
until the NSS
had opened
to reveal the
plans”
to welcomed the changes:

This week you take
inspiration from Kevin
Spacey, and try and use
“I choose now to live as
a gay man” as an excuse
for getting your lab report
in late. Your supervisor
doesn’t buy it.
This week you raise a
motion at Union Council
to give the person behind
Memeperial a permanent
spot on Council. It passes
unanimously.
This week you apply for
extenuating circumstances
for your first piece of
assessed coursework.
Turns out ‘commitment
to the sesh’ isn’t a good
enough excuse.
This week you decide to
pay tribute to Antonio
Carluccio, and get RSM
Café pasta every day of
the week. You’d have
done so anyway, but now
you have a nice reason for
doing it.
This week you miss the
last minute memo about
the Union buildings
being shut down over
the weekend, and spend
48 hours trapped in the
DramSoc storage space.
Still better than Metric.
This week you’re
Imperial’s senior
leadership team, and
you’re upset that the
BBC are displaying clear
pro-Oxbridge bias with
their Paradise Papers
story. Why can’t they
investigate your tax
returns?
This week you’re the
Felix Sports Editor, and
you’re incredibly dubious
about the fruit that’s on
offer in the office.
This week you’re a
member of the RSM
rugby club, and you were
secretly excited about
the prospect of the Bottle
Match being cancelled.
Cornwall is fucking far.
This week you move back
into halls to try and relive
your lost youth. Your
floor-mates are playing
‘Thrift Shop’ on repeat,
and keep using words like
‘sesh’. You move out next
week.
This week you’re the
campus services survey
the Union sent out, and
does anyone actually
know what happened to
you?
This week you’re Joni
Mitchell, and it was your
birthday! Happy Birthday
Joni! (Ed: it’s my fucking
paper and I can say what
I want)
This week you feel
inspired from Priti Patel,
and decide to mix work
with pleasure by doing a
strawpedo every time you
finish a question on your
problem sheet. It doesn’t
end well.

The change, which
was rolled out this
week, will make
Twitter threads even
more boring.
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
witter has
extended the
character limit
available on
tweets from 140 to 280,
leading to waves of
self-doubt as people find
they have nothing really
that interesting to say.
The move, which was
first trialled in September,
has been rolled out to all
330 million active users
as of this week. In a
statement, a representative
from Twitter explained
that “despite absolutely
nobody asking for this, we
feel that it’s important we
made some kind of change
soon, before everyone just
moves on to Snapchat.”
However, not every-
body is happy about the
changes: numerous users
have expressed concern
that they won’t have
anything interesting to
say within the new limit:
“I really loved Twitter,”
said Laura Wisling, a
third-year chemical en-
gineering undergraduate,
“all my activities and
thoughts perfectly fit into
the 140 character count.
Sometimes I would even
go over and have to cut
I’m struggling to fill up
the limit, and I’ve realised
that most of what I do and
say is hollow and mean-
ingless.”
One student, who did
not want to be named,
said that he was “initially
sceptical” about the move,
but has since changed
his mind: “I mainly use
Twitter to discuss Marxist
theory,sendabusivetweets
to Laura Kuenssberg,
and explain feminism to
some of the few women I
follow. Rather than seeing
this change as a reason to
make my lengthy Twitter
threads be comprised of
fewer tweets, I can just
keep the same number of
tweets, but convey twice
as much information.”
A Union represent-
ative told Felix “we’re
very excited about these
changes. More characters
means more engagement,
and more engagement
means more chances for
student democracy to be
deepened.”
Get used to seeing this shit on your timeline // Felix
Increased Twitter character limit leads people to realise
they’ve nothing of worth to say
“Before, I
would fill up
the limit, and
have to cut
down, which
made me feel
well verbose”
