IC Volleyball hit back against a disorganised LSE
T
his Wednesday IC
Volleyball Club
was scheduled
to play London
School of Economics in
both ladies’ and men’s
but at different venues.
Early in the week the two
fixtures seemed destined
to cancellation after a
lack of referees in Greater
London hit both clubs.
After relentless efforts
from committee members
and sports administrators
in both universities, the
matches could finally be
played as initially sched-
ule, or almost: home at
Ethos for the ladies and
away at Britannia Leisure
Rookie-heavy team fends off a burger against Kent
T
he American
football season
has started again,
with the Imperial
Immortals returning to
Division 1 to defend their
title as division champi-
ons. We are determined
to do just as well this year
again, and return to play-
offs for another chance
to move up to the next
division. Unfortunately,
we suffered a loss of 42-0
on our first game of the
season against the Kent
Falcons. We gave 100%
on the field and tried our
best to push back the Kent
offence, but with our new
team consisting of mostly
rookies, some mistakes
were inevitably made. We
are, however, taking this
loss as a learning oppor-
tunity to better ourselves
for next time. Ben ‘wears
red jeans, not a medic,
still a’ O’Brien led the
charge on offence, doing
the best he could to read
game and make crucial
decisions. He was able to
lead our offence to gain
crucial yardage, but sadly
did not manage to attain a
touchdown.
Our defence was also
still finding its footing in
the first half of the game,
with Kent scoring 32
points before half time.
Nonetheless, after the
second half we came into
the third quarter looking
strong; by improvising,
adapting, and overcoming,
we pushed back in the
second half of the game,
only letting Kent score 10
points.
Tom ‘where’s your
ball pump’ Smith won the
defensive MVP award for
his constant hard work and
perseverance on defence,
playing as an outside
line-backer and stopping
many outside runs and
passes. Tom even played
various offensive downs
to help the offence. Defen-
sive prowess aside, Tom’s
offensive plays were also
incredible, catching out
Kent many times with his
great timing on the rocket
toss play.
Great consistent plays
were also made by David
‘whiffy Dave’ Rovick,
playing both offence and
defence up until the first
half. However, after the
first half our quarterback
was unfortunately injured,
and David stepped up
to the role, leading the
offence. Using his veteran
knowledge of American
football, David made
good reads and lead major
drives for the offence.
A big shout out to
Harry ‘Mr. steal your ex’
Lawrence for going 100%
all game and showing
great leadership in times
of need for both offence
and defence. Harry played
outside line-backer and,
despite having an injury
scare in the third quarter,
he gave all he had and
managed to make plays up
until the end of the game.
This dedication, paired up
with the plays he was able
to make, managed to win
Harry overall MVP for the
game.

Centre for the men.
Ladies’
A great start of the
season for the ICVC
women’s team, who
won 3-0 against LSE at
their home venue, Ethos.
With the clear objective
of being promoted to 1st
division again, the team
seems to be heading in the
right direction!
The start of the game
was a bit tough, with the
reception being weak, not
allowing proper hitting.
However, after six lost
points in a row, the team
started improving the
reception, and some
amazing hitting was seen.
Great serves from Chloe
Lacombe (the Club’s Pres-
ident and opposite player
of the team) also allowed
the team to fully come
back to the game, and
great defence was also key
in winning the first set.
During the second
game, LSE showed very
good defence making it
harder for the team to
finish the points quickly.
However, constant and
strong hitting – especially
from the outside player
Eszter Ujvari and the
middle player Sarah Wet-
tstadt – allowed the team
to keep winning point after
point. Great setting from
Lucia Cilloni was key in
making those amazing hits
happen.
During the third set,
some rotations took
place, allowing a newly
trained setter, Gemma
Pitotti, to do an amazing
job at distributing the
game, especially between
positions 4 and 2. Even if
some mistakes kept LSE
closer during this set, the
team stayed confident
throughout the whole time
and ended up winning this
third and last set.
This first victory was
extremely important for
the team, since they need
to finish first in the league
to be promoted to first
division.
after multiple potential re-
scheduling, ICVC Men’s
arrived at Britannia LC for
warm-up at 17:30. After
some light individual
warm-up, the bad news
arrived … LSE had not
booked the venue. ICVC
Men’s could now go home
after an anti-climactic win
by forfeit. Not really the
promised challenge they
had in mind …
ICVC Men’s is due to
return to competition next
week for a home match
against the University of
Essex. First serve at 18:30
at Ethos.

ICSWPget along swimmingly at their annual team gala
in Cambridge
Through trials and tribulation an IC swimming squad make it to their first Gala of the year. Wins and victory pints
were had; a great start to the year.

T
he first swimming
gala of the year
saw ICSWP go
to Cambridge for
their annual team gala.
Sporting their finest navy
and red new kit, a team
of 18 Imperial swimmers
arrived ready to impress,
competed like champions,
and left with their heads
held high.
A brand new initiative
saw 16 members of the
elite Seal Squad ill-advis-
edly share a bus with UCL.
Others unfortunately, but
admirably, got the train.
After a somewhat con-
cerning journey, involving
a worm-on-a-string and
no fewer than three break-
down scares from the
old and tired bus (which
eventually led to us being
dropped off on the wrong
side of the city), like a
flock of birds migrating to
their nesting grounds, the
team were drawn to the
pool like dodgy Blackpool
souvenirs to a fridge.
Officially qualified
Timekeeper Ross Hunter
bravely volunteered to
lead our administrative
and record-keeping
duties – a challenge made
somewhat trickier by the
lack of a team stopwatch.
Nonetheless, if ICSWP
is known for anything,
it’s success in the face
of adversity; a working
stopwatch was sourced,
as was a pen, and Ross
was able to competently
fulfil his destiny (until it
was his turn to get in the
pool). With warm up done,
the team ready and a time-
keeper with stopwatch
in hand, it was time for
action
Well known for their
cheerleading skills,
Imperial set off a new
standard this year with the
raucous team cheering the
team’s every move at the
end of the lane, and each
individual race seemed
the climax of the event.
Every time, the excite-
ment would appear to
bubble on at every photo
finish, before being forced
to reset on the official’s
seemingly impossible
demand for silence at
achievement for a new
team with early-season
fitness.
A good swim meet
win through Bryce Puszet.
This was quickly followed
by back to back wins by
Captain Clara Bachorz
and Rhys Rickard-Frost,
and in no time Imperial
had already won three
out of the first six races!
Electrified by the team
cheering and carried away
by impressive victories,
the swimmers gave it all
they had. This is the kind
of stuff you dream of as
a kid when sleeping after
training; the pinnacle of
anyone’s career, or at least
University swimming.
The perfect recipe for
lactic acid, illness, and
hopefully, success. And
success there was! Quick-
fire relays in every stroke
were next up on the list.
Some expert takeovers,
speedy swims including
or not rubber ducks,
and slippery swimwear
(@Richard Prior) saw
Imperial take victories in
two of the races, beating
UCL in the process. Final
finishing position for
ICSWP was 4th
; a great
in fact 19 and had just for-
gotten his ID was clearly
off. Settling in for the
backup plan did include
some whining from senior
members of the team (I’m
looking at you David), but
the meal ended up being
a complete success as the
team filled their bellies
with tasty pizza from Zizzi
restaurant.
Those leaving already
loaded onto the train (good
try Clara & Clemency), it
was time for a night out
back in the local Spoons.
Pints were drunk, VK’s
were downed, and the
dancefloor gave birth
to very promising new
talents just a few weeks
away from BUCS. The un-
expected news of having
to push back the leaving
time by an hour due to our
dearest London colleagues
forgetting about the time
change did not affect the
mood in the slightest.
It did however lead to
adverse consequences
such as ‘extra dancing’
and ‘a dodgy kebab’, as
well as a very sleepy bus
ride home.
Arriving back to
London at 4am, everyone
was ready for bed. A long
tube ride home for the
bravest of the team, or
else an Uber, followed by
cup of milk, and a night
cuddled up in bed was
necessary to recover from
a very exciting day. The
night was spent dreaming
of the next swimming
gala ICSWP will go to –
Sheffield here we come!
Great job to everyone who
swam, amazing result for
our first gala, we can’t
wait for the next one!!
