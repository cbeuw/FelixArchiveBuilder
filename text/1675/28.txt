A
s the sun rose
on the first
morning of
November, the
Cross-Country runners
woke up and – looking at
their alarm – saw it was
already time to grab their
kit for the second London
Universities and Colleges
(LUCA) race of the
season. The race would
take place at Mitcham
Common in South
London, just two weeks
after their staggering
performance at Parliament
Hill where the Women’s A
Team took first place and
the Men’s A Team took
second, only three points
behind Brunel.
Meeting at noon at Beit
Quad, the squad took the
tube to Wimbledon, and
then the tram towards Bed-
dington Lane, where they
then walked to the course
which had earlier been
set-up by some selfless
Imperial volunteers.
Having set up camp
near the finish line, the
Imperial runners went for a
vital warm-up to scout out
the route, but it was soon
time to make their way
to the starting line – the
race was about to begin.
“Despite the
increasingly
chilly and
short days, the
team was as
motivated as
ever”
“ICXCAC
races are not
complete
unless they
end with
some baking
degustation”
kicked in. They went on
to run at a steady pace
until the very end, with
the women finishing after
two hard laps and cheering
the men to the finish line
who were completing their
third and final lap.
Despite the increasingly
chilly and short days, the
team was as motivated
as ever as they set-off for
their gnarly race around
the park, with the women
and men completing a
hilly six and nine km race
respectively. Although
some members did not
make it to the race this
time, Imperial still put in a
huge effort that did not go
unrewarded: the hours of
training paid off as Katie
Olding took 6th
, Women’s
Captain Anna – 10th
,
Sarah Grover – 12th
, and
Club Captain Alex – 14th
which meant Imperial’s
Women’s A team doubled
their points lead on
UCL’s, King’s, and LSE’s
A teams, with Imperial’s
Women’s B team coming
5th
overall out 32 women
teams: an absolute banger.
As for the Imperial
lads, they also did a great
job with Chris Thomas
leading Imperial’s A
team home, finishing in
seventh place just over the
30-minute mark, Oliver
Newton coming in 17th
place, Daniel Ayers in
21st
, and Joshua Mills in
23rd
, meaning the Men’s
A team ended up in 3rd
place, leapfrogging Brunel
and leaving them just ten
points behind UCL. The
B and C team also did a
great job and are currently
sitting seventh and tenth in
the league.
Naturally, Imperial
College Cross-Country
races are not complete
unless they end with some
baking degustation, and
once again the members
went out of their way
to bake many sweet
delicacies for the sturdy
runners and volunteers. As
it started getting darker,
the team started packing
and made their way to
the station in order to get
home, shower, and prepare
for the much-anticipated
Halloween-themed house
crawl: a great night out to
celebrate some top running
and reaching the milestone
of 200 club members that
same day!
All in all, ICXCAC
managed to keep up the
pace after a good start in
the Cross-Country season,
which will hopefully
continue with even more
impressive results in their
next race on the 15th
of
November at Wimbledon
Common; until next time,
cheerio!

and team-talk huddle, the
63 brave runners tied their
shoe laces, put on their
navy and scarlet vests, and
got in place for the race
to begin. Following a rel-

runners soon faced some
steep hills and put on a
brave face as the climb
