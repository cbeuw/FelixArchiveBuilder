NHS watchdog reveals crippling waiting time for child
and adolescent mental health services
The Care Quality Commission report reveals an insight into how the Government’s austerity budget is neglecting a
crucial aspect of healthcare in this country.

T
he government
has been accused
of ‘neglecting’
children’s mental
health, following a report
revealing some children
were waiting up to 18
months for treatment.
The report, which was
authored by the Care
Quality Commission
(CQC) – an independent
regulator of health and
social care services –
showed that young people
may wait months for
assessment after an initial
referral, and even longer
before starting treatment.
The report also high-
lighted that such lengthy
delays can cause their
mental health to deteri-
orate further, increasing
the chance of children
dropping out of school,
self-harming, or becoming
suicidal.
As a result of over-
stretched services, 1 in 5
children cannot be seen
by the NHS, forcing many
families to turn to expen-
sive private treatment.
However, with private
therapy costing up to £200
a session, the NHS is the
only option for many
families.Aseparate report,
published by charity
The Children’s Society,
showed that 30,000
children were turned away
from support every year,
with local NHS services
not able to support them.
Furthermore, the CQC
report showed that when
children can access care, it
does not always meet their
needs, and 39% of child
and adolescent mental
health services (camhs)
across the UK need im-
provement. The NSPCC
has received an increase
in calls to Childline from
children struggling to
access mental health
children are telling us at
Childline, with one in
three counselling sessions
last year relating to mental
health and a record number
of counselling sessions
about suicidal thoughts.”
“Many of these children
tell us that they are strug-
gling to access support,
even at crisis point. It’s
clear that the system
supposed to provide early
help for children expe-
riencing mental health
problems is broken in
many part of the country.
Without improvements in
how services are funded,
planned, and delivered,
thousands of children
will continue to struggle
alone.”
NHS services are strug-
gling to cope due to rising
demand, lack of qualified
staff, and an overall lack
of funding. The quality
of service across the UK
has been described as
patchy, and in some cases
young people have been
sent hundreds of miles
away from their families
to access a hospital bed.
The number of under-18s
ending up in hospital fol-
lowing self-harm has risen
dramatically over the past
decade: between 2011 and
2014, incidence of self-
harm in girls rose by 68%.
Jeremy Hunt, Secretary
for Health, last year said
that camhs were “possibly
the biggest single area
of weakness in NHS
provision at the moment”.
Investment has gone up by
£100 million in the past
year, after being reduced
by around £50 million
between 2010 and 2015.
Hunt has promised an
extra £1.4 billion will be
invested annually by 2021.
However, a survey of over
3000 NHS mental health
staff, released earlier this
year by a collection of
mental health organisa-
tions, found a third said
their service was facing
downsizing or closure.
The full report, request-
ed by the PM in January
2017, was officially
released last week. A

Barbara Keeley MP,
Labour’s Shadow Cabinet
Minister for Mental
Health, said: “This report
reveals the Tory Govern-
ment’s abject failure of
children and young people
in urgent need of mental
health treatment… Labour
will continue to call on the
Tory Government to invest
in and ring-fence mental
health budgets as Labour
pledged at the General
Election, so that money
reaches the underfunded
services on the front line.”

spokesperson said: “Our
commitment to improv-

our additional £1.4 billion
investment, more trained
staff, and more children

paper on children and
