“...Joey has
crafted an
abrasive body
of work which
screams,“Fuck
white America,
fuck white
supremacy and
fuck Trump!”
“In an era
where
countless
young artists
only rap about
women, drugs
and money, it’s
both rare and
refreshing for
a 22 year old to
be so socially
conscious”
You can’t Trump the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$
On the anniversary of Donald Trump’s election, we revisit one of the year’s most political hip-hop albums
“Joey delivers
an anti-
establishment
protest album
with which
he provides
a social
commentary
from the
perspective of
a young black
man living
in Trump’s
America”
alert to injustice in society,
especially racism” and the
term has been popularised
in recent years due to its
association with the Black
Lives Matter movement
on social media. Joey
uses the rest of this track
to expand further on this
concept of staying woke,
with lyrics like, “Some
of us woke while some
stay snoozed// Zombies
walkin’ around trippin’
over issues” serving as a
message that there needs
to be an awakening of the
mass consciousness to
the social ills prevalent in
modern America.
FOR MY PEOPLE
follows and we hear Joey
embrace his position as a
leader of the people and
seek to encourage those
Americans afflicted by
the corrupt system with
the uplifting chorus, “This
for my people, trynna
stay alive and just stay
peaceful// So hard to
survive a world so lethal//
Who will take a stand and
be our hero, of my people,
yeah?”. In an era where
countless young artists
only rap about women,
drugs and money, it’s both
rare and refreshing for a 22
year old to be so socially
conscious. Joey recognis-
es that a lot of his young
fans pay more attention
to rappers than to their
parents and teachers and
he has previously spoken
about feeling a sense of
responsibility as a young
artist to therefore spread a
positive message through
his music. Joey’s accept-
ance of this responsibility
as a young artist separates
him from the other young
rappers coming up in the
game and bars like, “So
I thank the Lord when I
wake up in the morn’//
Cause to inform the world
the very reason I was
born” allude to this.
Another thing that
sets Joey apart from
his contemporaries is
his appreciation of 90’s
hip-hop. I would argue
that Joey’s admiration for
that era of hip-hop has
him described as a “boom-
bap revivalist” whose
old-school style would be
more at home in the 90’s.
Regardless, Joey stays true
to his Brooklyn roots on
this album by spitting over
classic boom-bap beats
on tracks like RING THE
ALARM, which features
Kirk Knight, Meechy
Darko and Nyck Caution,
and the Styles P assisted
SUPER PREDATOR.
Joey’s old-school vibe
particularly shines through
on TEMPTATION. The
album’s third track is one
ofthestandoutsandwefind
Joey confronting racism,
prejudice and bigotry. The
track’s intro and outro
sample a speech given
by nine year old Zianna
Oliphant at a council
meeting in the wake of the
police shooting of Keith
Lamont Scott and her
words resonate to provide
one of the more poignant
moments on the album.
The next two tracks,
LAND OF THE FREE and
DEVASTATED, were its
two lead singles and they
carry on in much the same
vein sonically as the other
tracks at the start of the
ally prefer when Joey is
more aggressive with his
flow and spitting bragga-
docious, almost ignorant,
bars (for instance, “Got
dragon balls like my name
was Vegeta” on Christ
Conscious and “Check
my style, check, check,
check it out” on Big Dusty
from his 2015 album,
B4.DA.$$). This aggres-
sive style of rap is almost
completely neglected in
the first half of this album
and isn’t really heard until
ROCKABYE BABY, the
ScHoolboy Q assisted
seventh track on which we
hear Joey proclaim “And
if you got the guts, scream,
‘Fuck Donald Trump!’”.
RING THE ALARM, the
eighth track and one of
my favourites, sees Joey
at his most boastful and
aggressive as he takes a
break from discussing the
album’s central themes to
take aim at trash ‘Sound-
Cloud rappers’ and the
general lack of lyrical
skill in the rap game right
now. Nyck Caution and
Kirk Knight spit, “All I
hear is that ad-lib rappin’
on my SoundCloud// Sick
of the trash out, this is
the crackdown”, whilst
Joey spits venomous bars
throughout, referring to
Red, White, and Blue // Hypebeast
F
or obvious
reasons, Donald
Trump’s presiden-
cy and the current
hostile political climate
in the US has provoked
a knee-jerk response
of protest and defiance
from hip-hop culture.
A plethora of rappers
have recently adopted a
more political approach
through their music and
22-year-old Brooklyn
rapper Joey Bada$$,
whose 2015 debut album
B4.DA.$$ was seriously
slept on in my opinion,
is no exception. With his
sophomore attempt, ALL-
AMERIKKKAN BADA$$,
Joey delivers an anti-es-
tablishment protest album
with which he provides
a social commentary
from the perspective of a
young black man living in
Trump’s America. From
the all-capitalised album
and track titles to the
album cover which shows
him with two middle
fingers up and the not so
subtle KKK references
throughout the album,
in ALL-AMERIKKKAN
BADA$$ Joey has crafted
an abrasive body of work
which screams, “Fuck
white America, fuck
white supremacy and fuck
Trump!”
ALL-AMERIKKKAN
BADA$$ kicks off with the
chilled intro track, GOOD

and its opening lines,
“Yeah (wake up, wake
up)// Free your mind (I
said wake up)// Good
morning Amerikkka//
Good morning Amerikkka
(I said wake up)”. The
echo of these lines sounds
innocuous and subtly
introduces the album’s
central recurring theme of
‘staying woke’. ‘Staying
woke’ is defined as “being
album. That’s to say that
all the tracks in the first
half give more relaxed,
reflective and nuanced
critiques of the American
political establishment.
However, in my opinion,
the first half of the album
is markedly weaker than
its second half. I person-
perhaps worked against
him in the past and seen
‘Dis Generation’ from
A Tribe Called Quest’s
2016 album We got it from
Here… Thank You 4 Your
service and he’s already
cemented his place as one
of the most skilled lyricists
of our generation, going
toe-to-toe with the elusive
J. Cole with ease on the pe-
nultimate track LEGEND-
ARY. In my opinion, Joey
has the potential to reach
top five status in today’s
rap game but, in order to
reach the upper echelon
of rap (with Kendrick
Lamar, Drake, J. Cole and,
more recently, Chance The
Rapper to name a few),
Joey needs to find a way to
better marry his reflective
side with the boisterous
bars featured in the second
half of the album. He does
this to perfection on the
tenth track, the Chronixx
assisted BABYLON. Joey’s
anger and sheer emotion at
the injustice dealt by the
American government can
be felt through every bar as
we hear him scream, “Turn
on CNN, look at what I see
again// It’s another black
man, died at the white
hand of justice// To tell
the truth man, I’m fucking
disgusted”, “Nowadays
they hangin’ us by a
different tree// Branches
of the government, I can
name all three// Judicial,
legislative and executive”
and “If black lives really
mattered, you niggas
would do something”.
Joey concludes the
album with AMERIK-
KKAN IDOL, a six-minute
thriller on which he
completely denounces the
media, American govern-
ment and criminal justice
system and delivers a
chilling warning to the
listeners- “Devisin’ plans
while you sleepin’, I’m
just trynna stay woke”.
The track is effectively
the culmination of Joey’s
musings on the themes
and subject matter
discussed throughout
the album, with Joey
touching on everything
from police brutality and
political corruption to
gangs, black-on-black
violence and mass incar-
ceration. The last verse in
particular is outstanding
and it arguably carries the
most important message
of a mainstream hip-hop
verse thus far in 2017.
This message highlights
the conspiracy theory that
the U.S. government is
using media and political
propaganda in an attempt
to “start a Civil War
within the USA amongst
black and white and those
alike”, and serves as a call
to action to those young
people experiencing
systematic oppression in
America.
Only time will tell
whether this album will
prove to be a “timely and
timeless masterpiece”, as
Joey described it in his
Hot97 interview. Although
he could stand to make it
more cohesive to better
reflect all aspects of his
artistry (he almost sounds
like two different artists
at different points on the
album), in ALL-AMER-
IKKKAN BADA$$ Joey
succeeds in delivering an
impressive sophomore
effort with an important
message.
himself as “the double
entendre monster” and de-
claring, “Resurrection of
real, you niggas fake” on
the chorus. In an interview
with Hot97, Joey describes
this album as “vegetables”
in an industry with a lot of
“candy and fast food”. He
sees his peers producing
easily digestible music
which lacks substance but,
in ALL-AMERIKKKAN
BADA$$, Joey has chosen
to craft a project which is
“good” for the listener.
Joey was ordained as
one of this generation’s
“gatekeepers of flow” by
the legendary Q-Tip on
ALL-AMERIKKAN BADA$$ // Pro Era/Cinematic
“We hear Joey
proclaim“And
if you got the
guts, scream
‘Fuck Donald
Trump!’”
