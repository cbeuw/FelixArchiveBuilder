EASY PEASY
FALAFEL
Here I have used Sainsbury’s wholemeal tor-
tillas, Co-op kale and pumpkin seed houmous
(which is hidden below the rest of the fillings),
vacuum-packed cooked red beets, and some
boiled kale.
1. Blend all that you need for the falafel
base in a blender. Alternatively, you can
mash the chickpeas with a fork, chop the
garlic and onion finely, and mix well.
2. Add in your choice of herbs and spices.
You can leave out any of those that I have
used or swap them with others – it’s totally
flexible!
3. Once you have your falafel ‘paste’ready,
form rounds and pan fry them with 2-3 tsp of
olive oil for about 10 minutes each side over
medium heat until they are crispy on the out-
side. You can also bake them in an oven at
190 °C for 15 minutes before flipping over
and baking for another 10 minutes.
4. Serve them in a wrap by spreading some
humous and adding leafy greens or anything
else to your liking!
O
ne of my big-
gest struggles
coming to uni-
versity is living
within a budget. I am sure
many students, including
myself, wonder whether it
is possible to eat a healthy,
balanced diet while also
living on a shoestring.
For me, the supermarket
is none other than the place
for distraction and pro-
crastination after spending
hours and hours camping
out in the library. As part
of this retail therapy, I
enjoy pulling my cart
through the winding aisles
of my local Sainsbury’s,
immersing myself with
thoughts of the scandal-
ously-indulgent array of
cakes, the luscious semi-
sweet Lindt chocolate, or
my favourite: Jaffa Cakes.
Or maybe I’ll conven-
iently reach for the ready-
to-bake fish cakes, crispy
thick-cut chips, or packs
of microwaveable ready-
made meals. I’m not trying
to deny that there are days
(or most of the days)
when we, as students, are
running against time and
the best solution to satisfy
our hunger is any food that
can be sorted out quickly:
food without much prepa-
ration and cooking, which
also means less washing
up.
But at the other end of
the spectrum, following a
dieting trend mindlessly
and overly-focusing
on the numbers on the
weighing scale doesn’t
only affect the metabolism
rates of our bodies, and
our general well-being,
but can inadvertently lead
to destroying a healthy
relationship with food.
When I think about
keeping up a sustainable
way of eating, I think
‘could I follow this plan in
the long run?’ I know with
most diets I will possibly
give up well before I
achieve my ‘diet goal’.
Hence, I learned to eat
in moderation – eating
what is right for my body
and adhering to a mindful
way of eating. I avoid
spur-of-the-moment grabs
of snacks and sweet treats
Some tips and tricks for your meal prep inspira-

loaded with saturated
fats, salt, and sugar by
not visiting these aisles at
the supermarket, instead
replacing them with fruits
and vegetables. A bunch
of cherry tomatoes, one
cucumber, and a pack of
four nectarines that I can
snack over two to three
days will not cost me
more than a pound each.
To satisfy cravings for a
cool treat, a pot of natural-
ly-sweetened yoghurt is a
good alternative.
I also always plan my
meals ahead and stick
to a shopping list when I
shop. Good meal prep is
the best option for those of
you cooking on a budget.
Undoubtedly, it’s also
healthier than your take-
aways – just prepare two
to three portions at one
time, meaning you can
save time on cooking and
washing up.
‘But what do you
cook?’, You ask. Pasta has
been a go-to student meal
because as long as you
know how to operate the
stove and boil your pasta,
you’re ready to dig in – at
the same time, it is super
cheap. But it’s not too dif-
ficult to actually prepare
your own meals, and
avoid just relying on pasta
by keeping your cooking
simple. For example, I
always stock my pantry
with staples like olive
oil, onion powder, garlic
powder, herbs, spices,
honey, and soy sauce. My
shopping list will include
vegetables like broccoli
or carrots, which just need
to be boiled, or a bag of
mixed peppers for stir-fry.
More importantly,
always eat intuitively.
Avoid any form of dis-
traction when eating – this
means put away your
phones! To consume your
five a day, go for fruits
and vegetables that you
enjoy eating and avoid
those that steer you away
so that you will not find
it a chore. Moreover, it is
good to swap in complex
carbohydrates such as
wholemeal pasta and
bread, leaner proteins like
chicken breasts that are
versatile in cooking, and
healthy fats such as olive
oil in your cooking.Alittle
change can go a long way!
