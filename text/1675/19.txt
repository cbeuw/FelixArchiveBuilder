T
here is a rumour
that there are
more sheep than
humans in Wales.
And all the road signs are
in Welsh and English. Plus
you can see the Milky
Way when the weather is
nice. Intrigued? Come and
find out for yourself!
Wales has several
national parks with
quite different features.
Snowdonia National Park
is beautifully wild, with
steep ridges, rocky moun-
tains, plenty of sheep, and
views stretching as far as
Ireland on a clear day. It’s
also home to the highest
mountain in England and
Wales: Snowdon. There
are multiple paths to go
up Snowdon, from the
scenic and not-too-taxing
Rhyd-Ddu path, to the
challenging horseshoe
path, which requires fair
bit of nerve and scram-
bling. You can choose
whatever option suits
you best. Alternatively,
you can even take a little
train that zigzags up the
Snowdon.
Once you’ve climbed
up, you can enjoy a mug
of heavenly hot chocolate
at the top of the mountain
as a reward. In the past,
people were drinking
beer there too! But just to
warn you – the chances of
getting a view at the top
are relatively slim: usually
you can see more on your
way back down, once
you leave the enshrouded
mountain top.
Apart from Snowdon,
there are plenty of other
routes you can take in the
Snowdonia National park.
For instance, there is also
a nice circular mountain
path called Y Garn, where
you start at a magnificent
mountain lake, ascend
a rocky climb, and
finally come to a gorge,
nicknamed the Devil’s
Kitchen, or, quoting one
of the medical students,
L
ast month, I
found myself at
Troodos square
in the moun-
tainous part of Cyprus. It
wasn’t my first time there
(I usually go twice a year)
but this time was different.
Whilst walking in a small
park there, I noticed a
sign to the Atalanti Nature
Trail, which reminded me
that I wanted to visit the
Kalidonia (or Calidonia)
Nature Trail last year
but its starting point was
closed. And so it sparked
my spontaneous decision
to hike there now!
Some background
The Kalidonia Wa-
terfall, at the height of
in total, which means that
you will need to ascend it
at the end. In general, the
path is considered difficult
to follow, especially its
ascending part, since the
surface can be slippery.
For me, a beginner hiker,
visiting on a late afternoon
around 6km, which takes
about 3 hours in total.
The Kalidonia Waterfall
is two-thirds of the way
along the trail – that’s 2km
from the starting point (or
1km if you start from the
other side). The complete
trail descends about 350m
12m, is one the highest
waterfalls in Cyprus. The
name originates from the
time the British settled to
the island, in 1878. When
Scottish people found
the waterfall, they gave
it the Latin name of their
homeland, Caledonia
(today’s Scotland).
Kalidonia Nature Trail
The Cypriot Tourism
Organisation has many
sign-posted natural trails
in Cyprus, and the Kali-
donia Trail is one of them.
It’s a linear trail of 3km
that starts from an old
road between Troodos and
Platres, and ends at Psilo
Dentro in Pano Platres.
You can also hike the other
way round if you want,
but the signs will show the
opposite direction. Since
it’s a linear path, the
distance of completing the
trail and coming back is
The hidden side of Cyprus
in September, it was just
about manageable.
Impressions
The thing that im-
pressed me the most was
the fantastic natural beauty
of the place. I didn’t expect
it to be so breath-taking. It
was terrific walking along
the Cold River (Krios
Potamos) the entire time.
I wanted to photograph
everything, and for this
reason, it took me more
time to descend than to
ascend. The only thing
that I wished I had done
earlier was to plan the
whole excursion to have
more time there. But since
I hadn’t done that, I didn’t
manage to finish the trail:
I continued my walk only
until I found the Kalidonia
Waterfall and then started
coming back because I
was afraid that I wouldn’t
have time to return before
sunset. The whole walk
took me almost 2 hours: 1
hour to reach the Falls and
then 45-50 minutes to go
back.
