T
he annual Bottle
Match between
I m p e r i a l ’ s
Royal School of
Mines (RSM) and Cam-
borne School of Mines
(CSM) will go ahead
despite reports there
were plans to cancel it,
according to Falmouth
and Exeter Students’
Union (FXU).
A petition started by the
CSM rugby team last week
stated there were propos-
als to indefinitely cancel
the annual varsity match
and remove the CSM
name from sports teams. A
representative of the CSM
rugby club stated that the
team had been told last
week “by an FXU Presi-
dent, plainly and clearly,
[that] ‘Bottle Match 2018
was cancelled’”.
However, in a statement
put out earlier this week,
Jamal Clarke, FXU Pres-
ident Student Experience,
said: “There are no current
plans to cancel the annual

tivists protested
at a celebration
of the Balfour
Declaration centenary,
held at the Royal Albert
Hall last Tuesday.
The event, titled
Balfour Declaration celebrations see protests
“Partners in this great
enterprise” after a speech
made by Lord Balfour,
was organised by Balfour
100, an organisation set up
by Christian Middle East
Watch to commemorate
the centenary of the Dec-
laration's publication. The
organisation stated it was
“a significant event in the
celebrations by Jews and
Christians of the Balfour
Declaration’s centenary”,
as Christians “renew
[their] support for the state
of Israel”.
Protesters gathered
outside the venue, waving
Palestinian flags and
banners in support of the
Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions (BDS) move-
ment, which advocates
putting political and
economic pressure on
the state of Israel. Coun-
ter-protesters carrying
banners in support of
Israel also assembled. A
police escort was present.
The Palestinian Return
Centre (PRC), an advoca-
cy group that was given
consultative status as an
NGO by the UN, had
organised a campaign
against the concert, which
it claimed gained more
than 13,000 signatures.
Balfour 100 reported
that the event had taken 18
months to plan, and was
attended by nearly 3,000
people. It included perfor-
mances from the British
Christian orchestra and
the London Israeli Dance
Institute.
TheBalfourDeclaration
was issued by the British
government in 1917, and
signed by Arthur Balfour,
the Foreign Secretary.
The Declaration states
that the government will
“view with favour the
establishment in Palestine
of a national home for
the Jewish people”, and
assist in facilitating this,
providing that “nothing
shall be done which may
prejudice the civil and
religious rights of existing
non-Jewish communities
in Palestine”.

Bottle Match between
CSM and RSM. While we
are aware of the petition
against the cancellation
of the Match, no such
proposal is under consid-
eration at present.”
FXU said that the
confusion had arisen from
an internal paper which
stated the Bottle Match
had been cancelled. This
paper was circulated
widely, “leading to this
understandable belief that
the match would be can-
celled”. FXU apologised
for any confusion.
enjoyed for many more
years to come.”
The Bottle Match is
an annual varsity match,
traditionally held in Feb-
ruary, between CSM and
RSM, one of Imperial’s
six constituent unions. It is
the second-oldest varsity
match in the country, with
the first match being held
in 1902. The petition says
the match has been held
each year, except during
World War I.
The petition, which at
the time of writing had
more than 3,500 signa-
tures, states that playing
under CSM “gives us a
sense of belonging to a
wider community”, and
that the Bottle Match is “a
culmination of over 100
years of a legacy which
unifies both players and
supporters alike”. It also
says the Bottle Match
“has become a huge part
of Cornish history”, and
it holds importance for
“every Cornish rugby
player, CSM alumni, and
spectator”.
The petition attracted
a number of supportive
comments: one signator
wrote “I competed in the
Bottle Match twice (in
2010 and 2011) and it was
one of the highlights of my
time at university”, while
another described partici-
pating in the Bottle Match
as “one of my fondest
memories with friendships
formed that have stood the
test of time”.
Initially only the rugby
teams participated, but
over the last ten years the
number of teams included
has increased, including
hockey, netball, and foot-
ball, among others. The
match takes its name from
a three-foot tall tin bottle
that was taken from the
top of a Bass-Charrington
lorry by RSM students in
1926. The rugby match
alone determines which
side will take home the
bottle: this year the bottle
was won by RSM, follow-
ing a 36-19 victory over
CSM.
CSM was founded in
1888 in Camborne, Corn-
wall, which was formerly
a centre for the Cornish
tin-mining industry. It was
merged with the Universi-
ty of Exeter in 1993, and
moved to a new campus
in Penryn, Cornwall, in
2004.
In a statement, the
FXU said “there is much
confusion over how clubs
brand themselves”, with
a number of names being
used by sport teams and
clubs. They said: “In any
moves forward, FXU will
be considering our various
clubs and societies’
history, heritage and the
views of all our students
in order to find a solution
that works and supports
the overall student experi-
ence. We look forward to
having these discussions
with our many stakehold-
ers.”
FXU also said that the
CSM Student Association
had been temporarily
suspended, pending in-
vestigation into the ‘PPE’
social, which saw students
wearing high-vis jackets
with slogans such as ‘I
love rape’.

Bottle Match to go ahead, following uncertainty over
its future
In a statement released
following the announce-
ment, CSM RFC said:
“One thing is clear: we
made a loud statement and
it was heard. Everyone
at CSM sport would like
to thanks the amazing
support and kind words
from the student body,
alumni, local community,
and beyond.”
A representative of
RSMU spoke to Felix,
saying “we couldn't be
happier that such a historic
occasion has not only been
confirmed for this year,
but – with nearly 3600 sig-
natures on the petition – is
now in a stronger position
than ever to continue on
into the future. Bottle is
always a highlight for
undergraduates, postgrad-
uates, and alumni alike ...
We hope it can be some-
thing that continues to be
