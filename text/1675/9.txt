n September 2017,
shortlisted entries
for this year’s
Dyson Award were
announced. For those of
you who don’t know, the
Dyson Award is an inter-
national award for current
and recently graduated
design engineering stu-
dents, coordinated by the
James Dyson Foundation.
The main purpose of the
award is to inspire people
and get them interested in
design engineering.
Here is a run through
my favourite entries in
their respective categories:
Sustainability
Name: Petit Pli
Designer: Ryan Mario
Yasin, Imperial College
and Royal College of Art
The fashion clothing
industry is hugely wasteful
and unsustainable,
particularly in terms of
children’s clothing as they
often grow very quickly -
children grow through 7
sizes in their first 2 years!
“The Dyson
Award is an
international
award for
current and
recently
graduated
engineering
students”
“The cup is a
design that
effectively
addresses a
simple but
common
problem for
the elderly”
Petit Pli is a children’s
line of clothing, specifical-
ly designed with the aim
of making the children’s
clothing industry more
sustainable. It grows
bidirectionally thanks to
its permanently pleated
design, expanding up
to 7 sizes as children
grow. Petit Pli is made of
machine washable fabric,
has a packable one size fits
all design, and is rain and
wind proof. In my opinion,
a simple yet effective
solution to a problem that
desperately needs fixing.
Health
Cup for Arthritis, Par-
kinson’s and the Visually
Impaired
Designer: Tao An Yu,
Rhode Island School of
Design
Elderly people, specif-
ically those with arthritis,
Parkinson’s and visual
impairment face many
unique challenges in their
daily lives: joint pain,
hand tremors, pouring
and difficulty in judging
liquid levels to name but a
few. This cup is designed
to alleviate some of these
problems, making daily
tasks like drinking tea - a
British tradition - easier.
The cup is made of
two parts; the lid and the
cup body. The lid has an
opening that allows for
flow controlled drinking,
minimising the risk of
spillage. It also includes
a wooden dowel that acts
as a liquid level marker -
floating when the cup is
full. The dented middle
reduces the need for tilting
when drinking, perfect for
those with chronic neck
pain. The cup includes a
weighted base, allowing
for greater stability when
lifted, minimising the
effect of tremors that are
often experienced by Par-
kinson’s patients.
It also includes a rubber
base, to prevent sliding
when on a surface and
cushioning if dropped.
The cup itself is designed
to be easy to hold in the
hand with a rounded lip
to facilitate comfortable
drinking. It is a design
that effectively addresses
a simple but common
problem for the elderly
and something the rest of
us take for granted!
Lifestyle
Bump Mark - bio food
expiry label
Designer: Solveiga Pak-
staite, Brunel University
This is one for the
freshers out there. Are
you tired of buying fresh
meat, then forgetting to
cook it and wondering if
it’s still safe? We all forget
things at the back of the
fridge and this leads to a
lot of wasted food. Spare
a thought for those with
visual impairments, too.
Have you noticed that
almost all food labels are
printed, in tiny ink none-
theless? Not great if you
have a visual impairment!
The Bump Mark design
hopes to make a tactile
food expiry label for meat
protein foods.
The label has 3 layers:
a bumpy plastic layer
covered by smooth set
gelatin jelly which itself is
covered by a plastic layer.
The principle is, because
gelatin is a protein, it
decays at the same rate as
the meat product within
the packaging. So, when
the gelatin starts to decay,
it becomes a liquid,

exposing the bumps in the
plastic below. Running
your finger over the label,
which was previously
smooth, gives the feeling
of bumps which means
your food is spoilt! This
design is ingenious
because, not only is it ideal
for people with visual im-
pairments, it also provides
far more accurate expiry
information compared to a
printed date!
That’s a selection of a
few of my favourites from
this year’s shortlist for
the Dyson Award. These
designs showed a common
theme for me: a simple but
intuitive design that effec-
tively addresses an aspect
of our lives we often take
for granted! So from this
humble writer, hats off to
the brilliant minds behind
these and many other
ideas, your inventions and
ideas may just change the
world one day!
