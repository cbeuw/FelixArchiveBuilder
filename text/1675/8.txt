Young blood rejuvenation
T
he first clinical
trial transfusing
young blood into
patients suffering
from Alzheimer’s disease
has been completed. This
research is the first of its
kind to determine whether
injection of plasma from
young individuals to the
cognitively impaired can
improve the symptoms of
their disease.
Previously, work has
typically focused on mice
in parabiosis studies,
which is when the circula-
tory systems of two mice
(old and young) are joined
together. The results of
this initially suggested the
rejuvenation properties
of young blood in older
mice. Research published
in 2014 then went on
to show that parabiosis
studies were unnecessary
and when aged mice were
exposed to young blood
plasma, brain ageing was
reversed at a molecular,
structural, and cognitive
level.
This new human
trial was conducted by
Alkahest, based in San
Carlos, California. The
clinical trial was led
by Tony Wyss-Coray,
founder of Alkahest and
neuroscientist at Stanford
University in California,
and Sharon Sha, another
Stanford neurologist.
Their aims were to
research the feasibility of
such a study in humans by
monitoring the tolerability
of the infusions from 18-30
year old donor patients
into patients with mild
to moderate Alzheimer’s
disease. Cognition, func-
tional ability, and mood
were also monitored to
determine if there was any
change.
Patients were either
infused with young
plasma over four weeks
or a placebo containing
saline. Initial results
suggested that the young
plasma was safe and well
tolerated in the Alzheim-
er’s disease patients. In
study highlighted that
results should be consid-
ered with caution due to
the small size of the trial
consisting of only 18 par-
ticipants. Despite this they
remain hopeful that these
findings show significance
and that we may be one
step closer to improving
blood transfusion trials
in humans. They say “the
results are promising and
warrant further explo-
ration of young plasma
in future, larger, double
blinded clinical trials.”
Despite the positive
findings there have been
ethical concerns about
similar trials charging high
participatory fees. One
such company, Ambrosia,
is charging $8,000 for
over 35s to receive blood
from under 25s, even
though it is far from clear
whether this method
will work. Additionally,
blood supplies are usually
required for more immedi-
ate causes such as medical
emergencies and surgery.
Ewe look familiar
R
esearchers at the
University of
Cambridge have
demonstrated
that sheep have face
recognition abilities, com-
parable to those of humans
and non-human primates.
Eight sheep were
trained to recognise
the faces of actors Jake
Gyllenhaal and Emma
Watson, former US Pres-
ident Barack Obama, and
BBC newsreader Fiona
Bruce. The sheep chose
the familiar celebrity
image over an unfamiliar
face. They could also rec-
ognise the celebrity faces
when they were presented
in different perspectives,
an ability previously only
shown in humans.
Previous studies had
shown that sheep could
identify other sheep and
human handlers that they
already knew. But what
the study’s lead author
Jenny Morton asked was
whether sheep could learn
to recognise someone
from a photograph.
She said that the team
of researchers “focused on
whether or not an animal
was capable of processing
a two-dimensional object
as a person”.
Eight female Welsh
Mountain sheep were
shown different photos on
two computer screens. The
sheep made their choice
by breaking an infrared
beam with their noses to
release a food pellet as a
treat. The sheep were able
to recognise the faces of
the four celebrities 80% of
the time.
The next stage was to
test whether the sheep
could recognise the four
celebrity faces if they
were presented in dif-
ferent perspectives. This
ability has previously been
shown only in humans.
Sheep successfully rec-
ognised the four celebrity
faces from tilted images.
While there was a drop
in performance with the
tilted images to 67%, this
is a magnitude similar to
that seen when humans
perform the same task.
Finally, the researchers
wanted to know if the
sheep could recognise
their handlers from a
photo. Images of their
custodians were randomly
interspersed in a sequence
of unfamiliar faces shown
to them on the screens.
The sheep were not pre-
trained to recognise their
handlers’ face as they
were with the celebrity
faces, but the sheep were
still successful, identify-
ing their handlers 72% of
the time.
All good for the sheep,
but why is this research
useful to us? Researchers
say it could help investi-
gate cognitive dysfunction
in humans.
Many diseases, such
as Huntington’s and Par-
kinson’s, impair face per-
ception, as do some psy-
chiatric disorders such as
autism spectrum disorder
and schizophrenia.
Huntington’s disease
has been modelled in
sheep, but higher order
behavioural and cognitive
processes, such as face
recognition, have not
been tested in sheep with
Huntington’s disease. The
same face recognition
experiment could be
repeated on sheep with
Huntington’s to study the
cognitive decline associat-
ed with the disease.
