Rag Week - Three Weeks to Go
A real Rag week is something that
very few people at college have
probably experienced, even if you
have been here for a couple of years
already. In past years the college
has not witnessed the levels of sheer
stupidity and general disruption
normally associated with that one
special week in the year. It has
instead seen Rag put on a week (or,
as during last year, 14 days) of
events with a couple of services,
like flanning and grim-reaping, in
a very minor role.
T H I S Y E A R all that's changing.
Already people have got the bit
between the teeth (and other places)
and are running with loads of crazy
ideas. A s far as I'm concerned, the
more people taking part and getting
into the spirit of things the better.
A famous person once said (or so
I've been told) " A s k not what Rag
Week can do for you, but what you
can do for Rag W e e k ! " . This year
that's far truer than ever before.
A s far as your input into Rag
Week this year goes, it falls into 3
main areas, all of equal importance.
(i) R A G E V E N T S . These are
events put on by or on behalf of
Rag. There's one on every day of
Rag Week and they're all really big
and worth attending. T h e proceeds
from these go to Rag. Whether it's
downing 20 pints at the Beer
Festival or leaping naked from the
back of a minibus outside Harrods,
take part.
(ii) O T H E R E V E N T S . These are
anything that anyone, anywhere,
cares to organise (though see me
first). They can range from you and
s o m e mates in h a l l getting
sponsored to wear fancy dress for
the week, to having your head
shaved, to your club or society
organising a sponsored bungie
jump. These events are as stupid
and crazy as you want to make
them. It's entirely up to you, but
take part.
(iii) S E R V I C E S . These have
happened in past years, but never
to the extent that is being planned
for this year. They include things
such as Guilds Hit Squad (paying
a team of experts to flan your friend
or lecturer), Handcuff-a-grams,
Gnoming and G r i m - reaping (being
followed by a gnome or grim-reaper
until you pay it some money to go
away), and many' more. A l l
proceeds from this go to Rag, so
take part.
A l l of these, the third especially,
rely heavily on your input. In the
next few weeks there will no doubt
be many lists circulating asking for
volunteers. Please put your name
onto as many of them as you can
spare the time for. If you don't want
to miss lectures during Rag W e e k
then just attend the events. If you
don't mind missing lectures and
being as silly as you can get away
with, then help us out and make
everyone else's lectures as silly as
possible for the week. W e only get
to do this for one week in the year,
so let's make the most of it and
really show the past (and future)
years that this year, 91/92, is not
only the craziest that I.C. has ever
witnessed but it can also raise the
largest amount for charity in the
process.
Rag W e e k is from Friday 15th
N o v e m b e r until F r i d a y 2 2 n d
November. If you're reading this
during Friday's lectures it means
that there's only 3 weeks to go, so
whatever you're going to do, geton
with it. Now!
So, Be M a d , Be Silly & Be Part
O f It! Cheers

What is U L U ?
What the heck is a U L U ? What
does it do? Those of you who have
been at IC for some time and you,
IC U n i o n hacks, may be familiar
with U L U already. For newcomers
who are picking up their first ever
copy of Felix this may not be the
case.
Let me say right from the
beginning that U L U is more than
just that building in Malet Street,
yes that one near Senate House.
W e l l , if that's not what U L U is,
then what the heck is it?
The University of London Union,
U L U for short, is a federal
Students' Union for the University
of London which consists of over
30 schools such as IC, L S E , K C L ,
U C L , a n d so o n . W i t h a
m e m b e r s h i p o f o v e r 5 8 , 0 0 0
students this makes us the biggest
students' union in Europe! In a
nutshell, U L U provides social,
c u l t u r a l , intellectual and
r e c r e a t i o n a l a c t i v i t i e s on a
University and Intercollegiate basis,
in some cases filling in, and in
others supplementing the facilities
of the individual college unions.
L i k e other students' unions,
U L U ' s functions fall into the two
main areas of 'Representation' and
'Provision of Services'. O n the
Representation side, U L U can act
in two ways: by supporting
i n d i v i d u a l u n i o n s f i g h t i n g a
particular issue; and campaigning
on issues which affect all students.
Continued underfunding of Higher
Education means that the University
and its constituent schools are
stretched financially almost to
breaking point exposing the students
to the threat of top-up tuition fees
and departmental closures. Further,
with the freezing of the maintenance
grant, introduction of student loans,
the removal of housing benefits for
students and the withdrawal of
income support there has never
been a worse time financially for
students than now.
Just to give you a few examples
of the kind of work that we do:
U L U together with other constituent
member unions, has organised a
'sleep-out' on Hallowe'en night to
highlight the 'hardship horror'
facing students, as well as debates
on Higher Education, as part of an
overall campaign to put higher
education and student financial
support on the political agenda
where it belongs.
U L U of course has plenty of
societies who are the life blood of
the union. Federal representation in
sports is again something of which
we are extremely proud. Some
teams compete internationally and
standards are extremely high. D i d
you know, for example, that the
University of London Rowing team
is far better than Oxford and
Cambridge?
T h e second main aspect of
U L U ' s work is the provision of
services; to absolute essentials like
the bar and restaurant. There are
also recreational facilities and IC
students can take advantage of both.
W e l l , I hope this has given you
some idea of what the heck a U L U
is. This year, promises to be a
particularly exciting especially on
the political front, with the certainty
of a General Election. W e often
think about 'going out there and
changing the world' and yes, there
are certain things we can change,
for example the Government's
policies on student financial support
or the funding of education. Please
do not underestimate the importance
of your involvement and please
watch out for publicity concerning
students' union events. W e can
change things, and U L U , with the
m e m b e r s h i p o f o v e r 5 8 , 0 0 0
students can be a formidable force.
Let's make the most of it.
Aye Aye Win,
U L U President.
