value o f manufactured goods has
steadily risen. So it is apparent that
the West is making a healthy (but
sick) profit from the way the
markets are structured. A s one
economist put it:
'The challenge for us to eliminate
the senseless dichtomy which makes
us wholesale exporters o f raw
materials, and wholesale importers
of finished goods, under terms
d e t e r m i n e d e n t i r e l y by the
industrialised countries, terms that
compel us to increasingly produce
and sell more o f our raw materials
in order to afford less o f their
products.' (SimbaMaknoni, 1989).
So what solutions has the W o r l d
Bank proposed? During the m i d -
eighties it came up with a gem
called S A P s (Structural Adjustment
Programmes). T h e Bank will only
allow governments to borrow if
they agree to run their economies
(and thus the whole political
structure o f that country) the way
the Bank dictates. (We might recall
the furore caused in this country by
possible economic intervention o f
the European Community—it would
seem that some sovereignties are
very much more precious than
others.) Structural Adjustment
Programmes involve liberalisation
of trade policies (i.e. reduction or
even elimination o f import tariffs),
increase in production o f cash
crops, and cuts in public spending
(i.e. reduction o f expenditure on
health, education, removal o f
subsidies on food, travel and so on).
A s a result o f these policies, the
condition o f the poorest sections o f
these communities have suffered the
most, and in several countries there
have been 'food riots' when the
strain has become unbearable.
The economies of these countries
have experienced a great step
backwards thanks to the policies o f
the W o r l d Bank which is interested
more in maintaining or 'looking
after' the interests o f the financial
system set up by the industrialised
nations than improving conditions
in the developing nations. T h e
W o r l d B a n k insists that any
countries borrowing directly from
or seeking its approval (without
which countries are unable to
borrow from anyone) must maintain
its (crippling) interest payments on
loans borrowed in the seventies.
Thus these countries must earn lots
of hard currency by selling as much
raw material as possible to the West
and then return it straightaway in
the form o f interest repayments.
Unfortunately, since the Bank has
told many other poor countries to
do the same, there has been a glut
in the c o m m o d i t i e s markets.
resulting in prices going through the
floor. So these countries have ended
up being much worse off today than
they had been before the W o r l d
Bank intervened.
A t ' T h i r d W o r l d First' we
recognise that the industrialised
world has taken enough from the
poorest countries in the world and
it is time for the process to stop. If
we are too selfish and greedy to put
anything back (and let's not kid
ourselves that we do) we should
leave these countries alone so that
they themselves can decide what
kind o f development it is that they
want to pursue.
T h i r d W o r l d First aims to
increase awareness o f issues
c o n c e r n i n g the d e v e l o p i n g
countries. A t Imperial College we
regularly invite representatives
f r o m various groups (banks,
charities, campaign groups, etc) to
hold talks, debates and discussions
which will hopefully motivate
people to take positive acton
(however small) both now and after
they leave College. These meetings
are held almost every Thursday at
lunchtimes—look out for posters in
the J C R and around college. W e
shall also have stands in the J C R
during this term, so come up and
talk to us if you are interested.
