Casualty Super Plug
A first year chemistry student,
Stephen D o r m a n , was seriously
injured last Thursday during a
m a s c o t k i d n a p attempt. H e
underwent two operations in
hospital after having his leg run
over by a car driven by another
student involved in the mascotry
attempt.
T h e a c c i d e n t h a p p e n e d at
approximately 9.45pm after the
Royal College of Science U n i o n
( R C S U ) fresher's dinner. Members
of the City and Guilds U n i o n
managed to capture the R C S U
mascot 'Theta' and were about to
make off from, behind the U n i o n
Building in a car when a group of
R C S U students attempted to stop it
by laying on the car's roof and
bonnet.
T h e driver of the car told Felix
that he 'expected them not really to
get o n ' and that he was surprised by
them 'jumping on the car and
covering the bonnet and r o o f . H e
said that he could not see clearly for
the bodies on the windscreen and
shouted for them to get off while
driving forward slowly. He said that
he stopped instantly when he felt a
bump from under one of the wheels.
A first aider and the St John's
Ambulance crew from the Albert
Hall tended M r D o r m a n until the
ambulance came.
He explained that the M r Dorman
had one side of his lower leg run
over, suffering a compound fracture
which required two operations in
hospital.
T h e driver told Felix that the
Police have reported h i m for
'reckless driving' and 'driving
without due care' and that he
expects to be 'charged sometime in
the future'. H e said that M r
D o r m a n asked the police not to
charge and that he was 'very
amenable'. He added that, in his
view, 'people were taking mascotry
far too seriously.'
A meeting called to discuss
mascotry has been convened for 5th
November. It is expected that the
use of motorised vehicles will be
prohibited for mascotry events. A l l
mascotry activities have been
suspended until the meeting.
Loan Applications Up
Student L o a n applications are up
this year, and the waiting list is
getting longer. L o a n interviews are
booked up until 25th November, a
date constantly being moved back
as m o r e students' m a k e
appointments. Last year, students
nationwide borrowed an average of
£388 under the loan system. This
year about 30,000 students have
applied for a loan of £570 or more
due largely to the freezing of grants
and the late arrival of L . E . A . grant
cheques.
A L o n d o n student can, this year,
borrow up to £660 with interest at
the rate of inflation - 5.8% for
1991. A new student on a three year
course taking a full L o n d o n loan
will, upon graduation, have a debt
of £923 from his first year,
assuming a constant inflation rate.
A 'sympathetic attitude' is said to
be taken to students who have either
finished their degree or dropped out
and are unable to repay their loans.
Tony Cullen, Assistant Registrar
at Imperial College, said that this
year 'student loans are a fact of life'
whereas 'last year they were more
of an option'. One hundred and five
students at I.C. have already taken
up a loan this year and an estimated
35 a week are registering. A t this
rate about one thousand students at
I.C. will have taken a loan by the
end of the year. M r . C u l l e n
described this as 'quite a high take
up rate'.
During yesterday's C o m m e m o r a -
tion Service an honary doctorate
was awarded to Richard Sea follow-
ing his revolutionary work at the
Electrical Appliance Research C e n -
tre ( E A R C ) at Silwood Park. His
discovery of a new family of alloys,
Stefaniles, reduces the losses in
transmitting mains electricity.
W h e n this material is used in a
household plug, the improved effi-
ciency cuts the average household
electricty bill by up to 2 0 % .
Preliminary market research in-
dicates that the new plug would
retail at under £4.
M r Sea graduated from Highland
University in 1982, where he was
awarded a 2.2 in Electrical E n g i n -
nering and Management. After
working at Dounray Research C e n -
tre for the Central Electricity
Generating Board for 2 years, he
was moved to the new research cen-
tre at Silwood Park. W h e n the
C E G B realised the direction his
research was taking project funding
was cut, and M r Sea had to return
penniless to Kayleigh in Yorkshire
with his wife and young family.
H e continued his research while
working in a local comprehensive
school and using their laboratory
facilities at weekends. Despite fur-
ther efforts by National Power to
stop his research it was published
last year and patents are likely to be
granted later this month. T w o
A m e r i c a n conglomerates have
already expressed an interest in
manufacturing the plugs.
Rich Sea who flew back from
N o r t h A m e r i c a for todays
ceremony was delighted with his
award. 'It erases all the pain and
hardship that we have had to endure
over the last decade,' he said when
interviewed with his wife and young
children outside the Albert Hall
yesterday afternoon. Clara, his
wife, added that 'it's wonderful, at
last Rich and I can put our feet up
after a long day.'.
National Power and National
Grid have as yet made no comment
about the completion o f M r Sea's
work.
