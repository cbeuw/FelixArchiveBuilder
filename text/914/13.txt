Making Sense of Suffering Bonfires
Some years ago " T h e T i m e s " of
L o n d o n asked a number of leading
writers to comment on the question
" W h a t is wrong with the world? "
G . K . Chesterton replied:
D e a r S i r s , I a m . G . K .
Chesterton.
Many would use human suffering
as an argument against the Christian
faith - " H o w can your good G o d
stand by while so many suffer?".
There is no easy answer for this
question, but it can be asserted that
the existence of suffering actually
supports the Christian view of Life.
Firstly, let us be clear that the
e x p e r i e n c e o f s u f f e r i n g as
something wrong or evil is a
challenge to G o d ' s nature rather
than his existence. W h y ? Because
it argues for design and purpose.
There cannot be wrong without
right, evil without good or disorder
without a standard for order. T h e
" r i g h t " or "normative" must come
Robocop 2
7pm, Tuesday 29th Oct, M e c h E n g

Yes, he's back. N o not M r U z i
9mm. W e ' r e talking about that
ultra-modern Knight of the streets,
M r K i n k y M e t a l - W e a r aka
Robocop. A s well as waging war on
a drugs gang he also has another
battle on his hands - the inner
c o n f l i c t b e t w e e n h u m a n and
machine.
The musical score for the film
was c o m p o s e d by L e o n a r d
Roseman, who has scored such
films as 'Star Trek I V , 'Fantastic
Voyage', 'Beneath the Planet of the
A p e s ' , 'Battle for the Planet of the
A p e s ' , plus an episode of the
'Twilight Z o n e ' to mention a few.
Roseman wrote the Robo-theme to
present M u r p h y ' s (Peter Weller)
current mechanical body and his
ever-hidden human soul. T o top it
all M u r p h y is threatened by a robot
designed by O C P to replace him!
Joining I C S F - the Imperial
College Science Fiction society -
couldn't be easier. Just turn up with
£2.50 either at the film or the I C S F
library (lunchtimes) and we'll do
the rest. Membership lets you see
one film free, whereas if you've
already seen a film this year, then
£1 will get you in.
Be seeing you!
First an observation. If G o d were
to eliminate the evil in the world,
He would have eliminated man.
M u c h suffering is inflicted by man
and much of the good that could be
done is neglected by man. Children
are addicted to drugs due to the
exploitation by adults. Humans are
starving whilst others gorge
themselves despite there being
enough food to feed the entire
population of the Earth adequately,
from outside the system. If we had
no sense of good, we couldn't
understand evil; leaving what we
call suffering, happiness and good
as phenomena of different varieties
and not relative to each other.
This leaves us with the question,
" I s G o d malicious, inflicting
suffering on us after having created
us to yearn for something e l s e ? " ,
or "Is H e feeble and someone
unable to deal competently with the
world that H e created?".
STOIC
Imperial college, quite apart from
being the best scientific university
in Europe, is extremely lucky to
have S T O I C (Student Television O f
Imperial College) to complement
internal media.
S T O I C has been broadcasting
within IC for 22 years and now it
has a well equipped studio on the
top floor of the U n i o n building. It
also has an enthusiastic membership
who work hard to produce a
diversity of programmes from
' G o i n g for Coppers' (made in
traditional quiz show style) to
regular news broadcasts.
S T O I C can be received by all the
halls in Prince's Gardens, the Junior
C o m m o n R o o m and the U n i o n
building televisions. This gives rise
to some technical nightmares as
S T O I C is in fact 'Cable T V .
Hundreds of meters of cable
running under the streets of South
Kensington, and constantly seeking
attention, are, in reality, the arteries
of S T O I C .
With a new influx of budding
producers, editors, news-readers
and technicians this term, S T O I C is
now looking to increase output and
variety. Documentaries concerning
the L o n d o n U n d e r g r o u n d and
London's Night Spots are being
considered, along with more spots
for the news and an investigative
' C o o k Report' type programme.
Maybe Imperial College could soon
be home to the fifth, national
television station!
Where is the human who has never
been a cause of suffering' to
another?
Perhaps the chief cause of
suffering is man himself. Perhaps
in accusing G o d , we accuse
ourselves. Perhaps G o d allows this
disorder - even that not directly
attributable to humans such as
disease - to point out to us that the
disorder lies in us, to call us from
our moral apathy to the one who
alone can cure us.
If you are interested in knowing
more we are running a series of
talks and discussions on the key
facts and issues of Christianity on
Tuesdays 12.30pm in Electrical
Engineering 403B, or contact me
via my pigeon hole. This week
(Tues 29th) we will be asking the
question can we make sense of
suffering and attempting to provide
some possible answers.

Third W o r l d First is certainly one
of the more globally aware and
environmentally sensitive societies
at college. They have several
interesting campaigns lined up for
the coming year. T h e society
m a i n l y a i m s to add to the
" t e c h n o l o g i c a l " minds of I C
students by informing them about
what happens outside their sheltered
environment.
The first meeting of the term was
sparked with exciting debates. (The
flapjacks were good too!.) Some of
the issues raised included the
present 'Nestle' policy, which is
leading to the malnourishment of
millions of babies where clean
water is a problem. T h e current
high interest loan policies of the
major i n t e r n a t i o n a l b a n k s ,
Barclays, Natwest etc, were also
criticised, since these are helping to
reinforce debt in the developing
countries.
F o r anyone vaguely community
c o n s c i o u s o r interested i n
broadening their outlook, the Third
W o r l d First society is a must. A t
50p only, the membership is the
lowest around. Talks are held on
Thursdays at the Clubs Committee
R o o m f r o m 12-2pm. W e e k l y
meetings are at the Southside Upper
Lounge at 12.45pm on Thursdays.
(So you'd better split yourself into
two halfs, so that you can attend
both meetings at the same time - Ed)
Remember last year's G u y Fawkes
party? Silwood Park, the IC field
station in deepest, darkest Royal
Berkshire plays host once again to
a spectacular night's celebration of
the notorious traitor with the pointy
beard. C o m e along on November
8th and we'll have the solemn
torchlit procession behind the G u y ,
then liven the night up with
shedloads of dazzling fireworks and
a huge bonfire. W e ' v e got the
sumptuous Knyves and Fawkes
barbecue, followed by a happenin'
live band and of course the
legendary Disco 'til Y o u Die. Make
this a party to remember, and bring
all of your friends. Don't forget
your sparklers!
Tickets are £4.00, and will be on
sale in the U n i o n office from 4th
November. T w o coaches will leave
Beit A r c h at 6pm and whisk you
back to London at midnight. Details
from the U n i o n .
