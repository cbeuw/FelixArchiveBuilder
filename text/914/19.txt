Amnesty on Death Row
O n 18 M a y 1990, the state o f
Louisiana executed a 30 year old
black man, Dalton Prejean, for the
murder of a white police officer on
2 July 1977, in the town of
Layfayette. Sentenced ten months
later, Prejean remained on death
row for twelve years before being
put to death by electrocution.
However, the real tragedy o f this
case is that at the time of the offence
Prejean was just 17 years of age.
The U S A is one of just seven
countries to have executed juvenile
offenders over the last decade.
Since the 1970s when the death
penalty was reinstated in 36 states,
90 juveniles have been sentenced to
death. A l l were between 15 and 17
years old at the time of the offence.
Although many of these sentences
were comuted to life imprisonment
on appeal, four were executed
between 1985 and 1990 and as o f
July 1991, 31 remain under
sentence o f death in 12 states. With
the possible exception o f Iraq and
Iran, the U S A has executed more
juveniles in recent years, and hold
a higher number on death row, than
any other country k n o w n to
Amnesty International.
In carrying out these executions,
the U S A has violated International
Standards which, although not
prohibiting the death penalty in all
c i r c u m s t a n c e s , u n a n i m o u s l y
prohibit the imposition of this cruel
and degrading punishment to
persons aged 18 or under at the time
of the offence. Such standards
include treaties of the International
Covenant on C i v i l and Political
Rights ( I C C P R ) , the American
C o n v e n t i o n o n H u m a n Rights
( A C H R ) and the United Nations
( U N ) convention on the right of the
child. T h e U S A is signatory to all
these treaties, although it has only
ratified the latter. In 1984 the U N
E c o n o m i c and Social C o u n c i l
adopted safeguards guaranteeing the
rights of prisoners under sentence
of death, also providing an age limit
of 18 for such a sentence.
Amnesty International opposes
the death penalty unconditionally in
all cases believing it to be a
violation of the right to life, as
stated in the Universal Declaration
o f H u m a n R i g h t s . A l t h o u g h
Amnesty does accept that juvenile
offenders should be held criminally
liable for their actions, it argues that
the death penalty, with its cruel and
irreversible nature, is an especially
inappropriate punishment in these
cases. It is widely accepted that

children and adolescents are less
responsible for their actions and
m u c h m o r e s u s c e p t i b l e to
rehabilitation than adults. These
arguments are further credited by
the melancholy words of Charles
Rambaugh, executed in Texas in
1985 for the murder o f a jewellery
store owner. H e wrote to a
penfriend 18 months before his
death at the age of 26, '...Istarted
making mistakes at a very young
age and never changed before it was
too late. 1 was 17 years old when
I committed the offence for which
I was sentenced to die, and I didn't
even start thinking and caring about
my life until I was at least 20.'
In addition to humanitarian
concerns over juvenile executions,
there are also some disturbing
factors that seem to recur many
times, in trials of juveniles that lead
to the imposition o f the death
penalty. Racial disparities are
evident in the numbers o f young
offenders sentenced to death. Since
1900 the U S A executed over 190
juveniles of which 7 5 % were black
youths. Under present statues, the
disparities based on the race of the
offender have fallen, although 4 9 %
of the 31 offenders currently on
death row are black, with 7 5 % of
the 31 convicted or murdering white
victims. In many cases, as in the
case of Dalton Prejean, trials of
black offenders have been moved to
• predominantly white areas. In the
Prejean case, the prosecutor then
used his peremptory challenges (the
right to reject potential jurors
without explanation) and excluded
all four black jurors from the panel.
This right was also exercised in the

case of another black youth Robert
Carter (still under appeal), where
the prosecutor used peremptory
challenges to remove 12 potential
jurors who had slight reservations
about the death penalty despite them
expressing their confidence in their
own ability to impose the death
penalty if they felt it appropriate.
Probably the most alarming
feature of many o f these trials,
however, is the incompetence of the
defence council in producing vital
evidence which would have shown
the mitigating circumstances of the
crime. During 1986 and 1987 a
team of psychiatrists studied 14
j u v e n i l e s under sentence o f
death(l). Extensive psychiatric and
neurological examinations were

made and evidence of psychiatric
illness or brain damage was found
in nearly every case. A l l 14 had
suffered head injuries as children,
which in eight cases resulted in
hospitalisation. Seven o f the
inmates suffered from psychiatric
disturbances from an early age with
four others showing histories of
severe mood disorders. Only two
had an IQ over 90 (100 being the
normal score). Twelve had suffered
physical abuse as children and five
had been sodomised by older male
relatives. O f the parents of the
inmates most had histories o f

potential mitigating factors were
ever brought to light by the defence
council during the inmates' trials.
