It's been a very busy week once
again. I hereby give thanks to Stef
Smith for running F e l i x this
Thursday evening whilst I was
gallivanting in the Natural History
M u s e u m . A t the time of writing I
don't know how Thursday evening
went (as it's Thursday morning
now). Thanks and/or apologies,
whichever is required.
Mascotry.
T h e accident that occured last
Thursday around the back of the
U n i o n building during a mascotry
kidnap attempt (see news pages) is
a tragedy for all parties involved.
T h e student who was driving the
car, who doesn't wish to be named
because he told me his department
might get uppity, seems genuinely
upset by what has happened. He is
as equally the victim of the affair
as the student who was run over not
just because of the legal problems,
but due to the probable emotional
trauma at the time. Equally, the
accident was not entirely of his
doing but because lots of people
decided to cover the front of his car
with themselves. H e mooted the
possibility that the police may not
press charges because the accident
h a p p e n e d due to g e n e r a l
recklessness by all involved.
It's probably not the time to try
to make capital of this affair as the
accidentee could very well have
been killed, but I am aware that
there is a m e e t i n g early in
November - called before this
occurred - to discuss mascotry. It's
very easy to over-react following
such an event, and I hope decisions
will be made that increase the safety
o f m a s c o t r y by i n c r e a s i n g
i n d i v i d u a l responsibility, that
people should ask themselves
whether its worth the risk before
they behave like lemmings. Safety
cannot be significantly increased by
banning any one activity, lack of
thought is the danger. Limiting
mascotry activities to the campus
and banning use of motorised
vehicles will stop this type of
accident, but there are infinite
varieties of accidents and you
cannot guard against them all.

The Tale of Two Colours
Once upon a time there was a big
Kingdom. The King had been killed
in a war against his neighbour over
the standard length of a foot, one
said it was his foot, the other, his.
T h e K i n g ' s two twin sons were
raised by two different families, one
family were colour blind and so
taught their Prince that grass was
red and blood was green. The other
Prince was brought up by a family
who only saw in monochrome and
so taught that blood and grass were
the same colour, only that coal was
darker than snow.
One brother issued a decree that
'Blood Was Green A n d Grass Was
Red' and the other issued a decree
that ' A l l Colours A r e T h e Same,
Only C o a l Is Darker T h a n Snow'.
They argued bitterly and organised
supportative parties, who eventually
came to blows.
There was a bitter battle on the
green sward outside the capital's
gates, turning it crimson with
blood. T h e brilliant grey and grey
uniforms were covered with what
they were supposed to contain.
A t last the two brothers met face
to face over the bodies of those they
had ordered to kill.
'What colour will your blood be
on my sword', spat one.
' T h e same as yours on mine',
sneered the other. Both stabbed.
A s they watched their blood
intermingle, forming a pool out of
which grass stalks pointed at the
sky, they noticed there was no
difference between them.
T h e sun set gloriously over two
wiser people who would not give
anything to the world by it. M o r a l :
never believe anything you think
you instinctively know.
Jeremy Burnell seem to indicate a
certain cattiness between them. It
has to be said that Jeremy saw
D a v e ' s letter b e f o r e it was
published, hence his reply being in
the same issue. In theory, the reply
should be in the following issue,
thus giving the general populace a
chance to respond at the same time.
But since Jeremy was going to write
a letter this week anyway it seemed
unnecessarily pedantic to press the
point.
Industrial Relations Take A
Nosedive.
T o whoever is responsible for not
g i v i n g A n d y T h o m p s o n , our
printer, his expected pay rise, I
curse with the fleas of a thousand
camels. With childlike joy he
opened his pay advice envelope,
and such innocence was dashed to
the floor as he read the damning
words. H e has been leaping all over
the office shouting ' A h want me
muneh! A h want me muneh!', 's'a
conspiraceh!' and 'they all heet
meh!' in a daft Rutland accent. He's
also been headbutting doors.
Whoever you are, I hope you're
happy.
Holbein
It appears that the news story run
last week on Holbein house has had
some effect. One of our news
reporters contacted D r T o u m a z o u ,
the Warden of Holbein to see what
had happened, if anything, and he
was told that 'the story had done
some good' and that they had since
received a microwave oven. His
main complaint concerned the
bureaucracy involved in trying to
get anything done in College. I
concur.
No editor like the present.
Andy B - get your life in order. Y o u
of all people should know what
happens to an editor if he is denied
a promised article on a Thursday.
