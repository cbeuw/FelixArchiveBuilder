C r a n e s - U L U
O w n up. H o w many of you were
there? Shall I tell you? F o u r , and
that includes my friend and I. One
is not even at I.C. anymore, and the
other would've gone anyway,
regardless of what I said about
them. O h , I forgot. There was a bar
extension on that night, wasn't
there? A n d you came here to
support the Ents team, didn't you?
Sure. Well, we managed both. W e
have our loyalties too.
So, I suppose you're interested in
what happened, then. Y o u want me
to tell you how great Tomorrow's
Tears was. W e l l , it wasn't. It was
the m o s t s p a r s e , b e a u t i f u l ,
necessary piece of music I've ever
heard live. A s far as icons go,
however, it isn't long before
Adoration accedes it. T h e nature of
this music is such that one almost
becomes subservient to it, becomes
part of it, and the desire to give
myself over to it completely is
f r i g h t e n i n g . Cranes are an
instrumental band. They don't play
'songs'. Alison's voice, whatever
you think of it, is not extraneous to
the music; the only correct appraisal
is that it is Cranes' sound. It is
complete. A s a visual spectacle,
Cranes are stunning. Alison is quite
O h dear. This is going to sound like
a diatribe, a pathetic little tirade
which will do nothing but enhance
my reputation for being a sullen
bastard. I hope those intentioned are
reading this. Y ' s e e , it has come to
my attention that certain people
seem to think I have an obsession
with Cranes. L i k e I'm obsessed by
Francis Bacon, Shelley, Wilde,
Sisters of Mercy, Gauloises, young
American girls, Kate Bush - shut up
and calm down, D a v i d . Y o u ' r e
ranting now. M y ego, too.
E v e n allowing for hypocrisy
here, I have nothing for them but
a well-aimed ' F u c k Y o u ' . Life is
about being obsessed by things - by
beauty, religion, politics, art, a
cliche like love. I don't mean to get
didactic, my own cynicism gives
me little room in this case, but what
I admire about people with loves
and hobbies is they get enthusiastic
about what they do, whether it's
looking at trains, carving wood
ornaments, even being tied to a
fucking bed and beaten senseless.
There's a line from one of the Tin
still, like her stillness is the only
thing keeping the world together as
the world, has another go at
f r a g m e n t i n g . She cuts an
impressively vulnerable figure
centrestage while behind her, reels
explore a ghost-child's nursery. Not
a gig. Not a seance or a mass.
Something other. There is some
maniacal movement onstage from
the other band members, but there's
none of that awful lighters-in-the-
air unity here. Y o u ' r e alone in a
c r o w d e d r o o m with a single
religious experience all to yourself,
and you're telling yourself that this
is the way it should be; you're
alienated and anti-social, but you're
also right. Only you could feel like
this.
A n y w a y , both before and after,
the audience were funny. Hilarious.
'Cranes are not a goth band'. I've
lost count of how many people have
said t h i s , m y s e l f i n c l u d e d .
Strangely enough, though, barring
the hacks, the entire audience is
comprised of the original skeleton
crew, all taken the day off so they
could do their make-up and hair.
What fun we had, a-laughin' and a-
pointin'. It ain't undead anymore,
it's very dead. W o e is me. Shall I,
too, dye? O h , H a H a . D ' y o u think
I'm taking coverage of Cranes to
extremes? T h i n k again; Cranes are
extreme. A n d you? W e l l , you
should start doing something with
your life. O r just fucking get one.
D a v i d .
Machine songs that goes ' Y o u can't
see me drowning, I don't see you
swimming'. Comprendez?
What enamours life to me are the
countless spices ingenious human
beings throughout history have
loaded it with. Socrates, Donne,
Marlowe, even Kesey- the list is
endless. Why make a point of eating
it raw? It tastes fucking awful. F o r
too many of you, alcohol is your
only refuge; alcohol is not a refuge.
If anything, it makes the whole
sorry mess even worse. Does the
scope of your vision amount to
nothing more than the tenth
observation of the bottom of your
pint glass, sorry, tankard? A r e you
going to vindicate this bullshit? I'd
like to hear from you. N o . I'd love
to. If I don't, A t least I can be
assured that you're the sad, pathetic
cunts I thought you were.
D a v i d Spooner
P.S. I shall murder one student
every hour, on the hour, until my
Cramps ticket is returned to my
desk. That goes for Y o u too,
flower. Y o u know who Y o u are.
Spitfire/Herb
-IC Union
I've been told that I'm not very nice
about many bands that play in this
place. It's true. I do give them a
slagging, but then again that's just
an opinion. It's like filling up the
photocopier really.
Herb are the best new band I've
seen for six months, but even if they
weren't, why were less than 100
tickets sold to over 6000 students.
Tell me, please, are you just
apathetic boring bastards, or what?
A s for Spitfire, they were
bearable, but they couldn't touch
Herb for sheer class, but for three
quid you can't go wrong anyway.
G o on, live. D r o p your wok and go
for it. Yes, of course we do, it's not
all work, work, work.

25th of May
What's Going On
I like this. Thought I'd better make
it clear as I always get asked why
I slag everything off, even though
I don't. It's dancey in an indie
sense, but faster than most.
T h e lyrics are supposedly 'right
on' and I guess they are pretty
catchy, delivered in a sort of white
rap style that, n o n e t h e l e s s ,
maintains its funk. This tendency
towards dance motifs does not carry
much favour with me - yes, I don't
really like indie records, but I guess
what swayed me in this case was a
hazy, hash-filled sunny Sunday
afternoon when I saw them live.
They were sound (please excuse
dodgy puns). M y only gripe is that
they were too smooth on the 12".
Live they had a bit of an edge, the
sound was rougher, the samples not
so clean. Not much of a gripe,
really.
So anyway, next time you cruise
through the record shop on the look-
out for some indie shite, pause, and
buy 25th of May instead. It's
unlikely that you'll be disappointed.

North Point Park
Middlesex Poly
T o describe North Point Park as
ropey is akin to describing Weeks
H a l l as s l i g h t l y s t r u c t u r a l l y
unsound. T h e y ' r e terrible. Truly
totally terrible. Truly terminally
totally terrible. Still, this might just
be an opinion of mine, and some
people were actually dancing to it.
Hell, if you don't believe me go and
see them. Just don't invite me.

Dance
to receive. T h e first, Ce Ce
Peniston, conjures up great images
of huge, phallic, thrusting beats. N o
go, it's shite. Soul/dance crossover
bullshit that will probably go down
well with the T o p of the Pops hand-
clap crew. A real chart topper.
D o m says it's great; ' A real garage
classic'.
The other is extreme. T h e band,
most definitely not the adjective.
Extreme are crap. G l a m Rock
cliche, wild, thrusting, phallic
guitar solos. It does sound good at
33 r.p.m., sort of Prong-ish, a real
cock rock hero's record. A r e they
gay? it certainly sounds like it. This
sort of band deserve all the chart
success they can get, 'cause they've
managed to perfect the over-
produced, over-promoted sound
that most guitar worshippers want
these days.
If anyone can think of any reason
why anyone could actually like
either of these records send me the
answer on a postcard to Felix, and
you can have either, or even both
of the singles.
