Welfare plug
Next week is welfare week.
Seminars and a health fair will be
held in the M a i n D i n i n g Hall
( M D H ) and the Junior C o m m o n
R o o m (JCR) and on Wednesday
evening there is a welfare bar quiz
in the Lounge Bar, so you can stun
your friends with mindless trivia
that healthy students usually choose
to ignore.
Before all that there is a cocktail
evening in the bar tonight from
7-9pm. This is followed by the Ents
Rain gig. There should be six
different cocktails to try, all of
which are guaranteed to impress.
Cocktail evenings will continue
every Friday with a different
'menu' each week.
For the duration of welfare week
pints of coke will be 50p and orange
juice 60p in the bar, so being
healthy is cheaper than usual. O n
Saturday and Sunday the Rugby
W o r l d C u p will be on in the
Lounge, so you can watch Scotland
getting thrashed (or England if you
support Scotland and are as biased
as I am) and then marvel at New
Zealand and Australia on Sunday.
After the weekend it's back to the
lectures. But to mellow out and
calm down there's a blues night in
the Union Lounge on M o n d a y
night. The bar has a Sol lager
promotion, at £1 a bottle. So you
can enjoy a quiet drink whilst the
band plays. Wednesday, as I said
before, has the bar quiz and the
usual Ents disco until l a m .
For those who still want to bop
there is a hallowe'en disco until
lam on Thursday night as well.
A n d finally, an event which is
planned for the week following, on
November 8 there will be a bonfire
party at S i l w o o d Park. T h i s
includes the fire, firework display,
disco, bars, etcetera and costs £3.
There will be coaches from South
K e n to Silwood and back at a cost
of another £3.
O n the elections front, papers are
up for one ordinary member of
House Committee. Again pop into
the U n i o n Office for details.
Last but not least, U L U cards are
now available from the U n i o n
Office every day of the (working)
week, but U n i o n cards are only
available T u e s d a y afternoon,
2pm-4pm.

Discussions
Because of a series of complaints
from the students and staff of the
College concerning the proposals to
change the Sports C e n t r e , a
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s meeting was
arranged between myself, Jonathan
Griffiths, M a r k Landon of the
Athletic Clubs Committee, M a n d y
Hurford, the U n i o n Manger, and
V a l Straw, IC's Facilities Manager.
This fruitful discussion, which was
held last F r i d a y , covered the
facilities on both the north side and
the south side of Prince's Gardens,
and included their past, present and
future position.
A new sports manager has been
a p p o i n t e d , w h o s e tenure o f
employment begins on November
24. She is Caroline Osner and will
have overall responsibility for all
Imperial College sports facilties,
including Northside, Southside,
Harlington, as well as the boating
facilities at Putney.
M o r e importantly, it became
abundantly clear that when any
changes do o c c u r in the
refurbishment of our existing
facilities, they will be 'designed for
students and staff of Imperial
College'. A n ethos which was
discussed was that the Northside
complex would essentially be
biassed towards sporting activities
and that Southside would be used
as a facility providing additional
'health' facilities, for instance a
g y m and a medical facility to deal
w i t h o r t h a p a e d i c a n d
physiotherapeutic needs.
In conclusion I would like to say
that I need feedback to find out what
students want as users of these
facilities. 1 need this from as many
people as possible so that the U n i o n
can represent you, the students, in
the most fair and productive way
A l s o , I would like to hear from
students who do not use the sporting
facilities but feel that with additional
facilities they would then become
users, however infrequently.
A n y comments should be left in
the Union Office, marked for the
attention o f J . D . Griffiths.
Finally, a further communication
meeting is being arranged between
V a l Straw, Caroline Osner, a
representative from the body of
students at I C , myself and M a n d y
H u r f o r d so that c o l l e g e
administration know exactly what
students need from the sports centre
and the Southside g y m area.

Ents Rant
' T h e most important thing about
Rain is the music. Once or twice
every decade a band emerges from
virtual obscurity, grabs the music
industry by the scruff of the neck
and commands the attention of the
entire country. It's a rare and
precious talent, but one that is so
obviously evident in Rain.
Rain p u r v e y o r s o f f u n k y ,
melodic, charismatic rock pack a
spirited punch in these days of
technology-driven 'flawless' music.
N e d and C o l i n don't believe in
stating direct influences, preferring
instead to refer to inspirations;
Jagger, Richards and C r e a m to
name a few. These inspirations are
perhaps most evident on tracks from
the forthcoming album: the gentle,
emotive Ocean Child and Taste of
Rain with its examples of the
versatility of a band who have their
feet firmly placed on 90s ground but
who aren't afraid to utilise what the
60s—and their heroes—had to
offer.'
This is Rain's official biography.
T o most people Rain are the band
who plastered breasts all over
London in the advertising campaign
for their debut single Lemonstone
Desired.
Rain are on tour now, and you
can catch them playing L I V E in the
U n i o n Lounge tonight, supported
by Scottish popsters Elephant
Noise.
Tickets are £2.50 in advance, £3
on the door and £1.50 with an Ents
card. Doors open 9pm.
T h e first few people to buy
advance tickets today will receive
(free) various goodies including
Rain T - s h i r t s , records, C D s ,
posters and badges—so get down to
the Union Office, slap it on the table
and buy a ticket!
