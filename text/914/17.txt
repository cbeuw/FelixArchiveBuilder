Why is the world in the state it is?
W h y do some people starve, others
wallow in plenty? A r e things
gradually improving? A n d are we
in the West really helping to bring
about a change for the better in the
lot of the poor nations?
There has always been a feeling
in the West that the developing
nations need our help. If only they
could learn from what we have to
teach them they would not be so
desperately poor. This was exactly
the thinking which helped to justify
the European empire in Latin
A m e r i c a , Africa and Asia. Today,
of course, this kind of moral
validation of the European presence
in these continents cannot stand up
to any kind of scrutiny. It is quite
apparent that the relationship
between Britain and India to exploit
her resources and any gain on
India's part was minimal and
incidental. H o w e v e r , I would
suggest that this argument is not
very far from the one used today in
order to justify Western actions, or
rather interference, in developing
countries today.
Let us start with the questions
'What is aid?', 'What does aid
really involve?' If we look at the
context in which financial help (be
it loans or donations) is offered to
developing nations, it becomes clear
that the intentions of the West are
not entirely benevolent. One of the
prime lenders of financial aid today
is the World Bank. The World Bank
was set up by the U S A and the
major western powers after W o r l d
W a r T w o , with the a i m o f
rebuilding war-torn Europe and
Japan, and after that to promote
financial stability, economic growth
and a cooperation with the member
states. T o d a y there are 151
countries which are members of the
W o r l d Bank—most of the countries
except Warsaw Pact signatories. A
condition of membership is that
each country must contribute a
certain percentage of its Gross
National Product (GNP) for the
Bank's use.
M u c h criticism has been made by
the poorer members concerning the
conditions which the W o r l d Bank
sets before releasing loans to
d e v e l o p i n g c o u n t r i e s . T h e
undemocratic nature of the Bank
means that developing nations are
almost powerless to implement
policies of their own choice: it is
assumed that the West knows more
about the problems in M e x i c o , for
e x a m p l e , than the M e x i c a n s
themselves. There seems to have
been no change in western attitudes
since c o l o n i a l t i m e s . W h a t
determines the voting rights of
countries in the W o r l d Bank is the
size of their pocket. Thus the U S A ,
Japan and all the industrialised
countries have the majority of the
voting power—the U S A exercises
18.5 % of the votes, while China has
only 2 . 5 % despite the fact that its
population is four times larger than
that of the U S A .
What all this means is that the
W o r l d Bank in effect acts upon
policies laid out by the U S A and
other industrialised nations.
The poor nations have very little
say how the world economy should
be run. This has had a devastating
effect upon them. O v e r the last
decade or so W o r l d Bank policies
have been deeply unpopular in
many countries. Unfortunately they
are powerless to do anything—they
have been denied a voice.
It is generally agreed that the
1980s were an appalling decade for
the poor nations of the world. M a n y
people also argue that the W o r l d
Bank helped make things worse
rather than alleviate the squalor of
the poor. The crisis was brought
about during the 1970s through the
m a s s i v e b o r r o w i n g by the
governments of developing nations
from banks in the West which were
overflowing with oil dollars from
O P E C countries. These commercial
banks (which of course include our
friendly high street chums in this
country) were very 'liberal' with
their lending policies. T h e interest
repayments were set at commercial
rates, which seemed reasonable to
both parties at the time. This was
a period of economic buoyancy and
it seemed that the developing
nations might at long last break the
vicious cycles of poverty. However
this mood of optimism was not to
last very long. During the late
seventies, the West was set for a
downward slide into recession. This
brought with it very high interest
rates w h i c h meant that debt
servicing replayments by the poor
to the rich nations were massively
increased.
However, high interest rates are
not the o n l y p r o b l e m . T h e
f u n d a m e n t a l p r o b l e m the
developing countries face today is
that of inequality in the world
markets imposed by the West. The
system is rigged up in such a way
that the value of manufactured
goods far exceeds the value of raw
materials (excepting oil of course).
In the 1980s there was a sharp drop
in raw material prices which meant
that the West would have even
cheaper access to them, whereas the
