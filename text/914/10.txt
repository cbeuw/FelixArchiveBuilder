Chapter 3.
Confusion.
The story gets
somewhat more
peculiar.
D i m lights a p p e a r e d i n the
c a v e r n . Stress's guide led him out
of the ship and over the tongue
towards an airlock set in one of the
teeth. A s stress followed the ghostly
glow of his guide's gum gear
through the d i m light, technicians
and robots swarmed around the ship
like flies around dung, removing it
so the reptile could continue
feeding.
T h e airlock opened on to a
passage which wound down and
around to a viewing area. Beyond
the tinted windows on one wall of
the passage, two wide tracks
stretched off into the distance in a
massive tunnel hung with bright
ultra-violet lights. Small tracks
came off the m a i n two and
disappeared down passages on the
right and left. Just below where they
stood the two main tracks curved
around and joined to form a massive
rectangular circuit.
Swarming up and down this
track, over holes and ramps on
strange i m p r a c t i c a l w h e e l e d
contraptions, were thousands of
heavily tanned y o u n g people
w e a r i n g sports c l o t h i n g and
sunglasses.
'Behold our masters.'
T h e guide swept his arm across
the view.
'They're the rulers of this place?'
'Definitely.'
'So they tell you what to d o ? '
' A h , no. Y o u misunderstand me.
W e , the greys, organise things so
that the tanned ones can have the
best possible time.'
'The guide smiled again. His
teeth were bright and glaring in the
light from the track. He began
walking down the passage.
'I'll now take you to the central
complex.'
Stress obediently followed.
The passage stepped into a wider
passage lit and filled with identically
grey clothed people w a l k i n g
purposefully along. Signs and maps
were everywhere but Stress soon
r e a l i s e d that most o f them
contradicted.
' W h y are half the signs wrong?'
'If someone doesn't know the
way then they don't have the right
information and no one sane gives
away free information. The signs
are there to weed out the weak and
indecisive.'
The guide followed signs marked
rubbish pit and emerged on a
platform stuffed with greys.
T h e guide cautioned Stress.
' T h e train we are travelling on is
powered by eye contact avoidance
so please look away from faces for
the duration of the journey.'
A train came out of the tunnel at
the end of the platform and slid to
a halt. They got on.
Sitting down inside the carriage
Stress felt very uncomfortable. He
was still in the bright blue and red
spacesuit of Earth's space fleet and
was clashing so badly with the sea
of grey uniforms around him he felt
bruised. T h e train got going.
Glancing around aimlessly Stress
noticed an attractive brunette a few
seats along the carriage. H e
couldn't take his eyes off her and
as the girl turned her head their eyes
met.
T h e train jolted and its contented
purr was replaced by an annoyed
grumble. Its grumbles were echoed
by grumbles in the carriage and
someone further along the row
shouted out.
' H e y , geek! W h a d d y a think
you're doing?!'
The brunette turned her head with
an annoyed tut, Stress went red and
stared at the ceiling where a sign
read I N E Y E A V O I D A N C E
E M E R G E N C Y L O O K H E R E .
Underneath the words there were
advertisements so boring that he
soon cooled down.
The train pulled out of the tunnel
on to another u n d e r g r o u n d
platform. A s the doors slid open an
announcer started speaking.
' W E h g l a k s e r g y . L A H E K R H .
FGHSehglshgrtuihsdfk, fdjsghvrea-
seas.' Stress strained to listen but
could make nothing out.
'What is it saying?'
T h e guide turned and smiled,
avoiding his gaze.
'It's saying welcome to the
central complex. Please avoid and
ignore everybody inside the lifts as
they are powered by eye contact and
physical contact avoidance.'
'But I couldn't make anything
out.'
' O f course not. It's deliberately
scrambled so that anyone who
doesn't know can't find out.
Because someone that doesn't
know...'
'I know the rest.'
Stress and his guide headed to the
lifts and kept as far as possible away
from everyone else until they were
allowed out. A quick walk out
through double doors and they were
before the central complex.
