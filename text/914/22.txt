Dear Adam,
Firstly I would like to do some
brown nosing and congratulate
Jeremy on the success of the careers
fair.
Secondly I have a couple of
observations to make. T h e number
of companies attending was 63, not
about 7 0 , and i n d e e d the
presentation was superior to last
year. This obviously was a great
benefit to the companies. T h e
students however had a small
problem. T h e 3,000+ (based on
Jeremy's figures) who attended the
first day had 500 brochures between
them. These were being produced
Dear Adam,
Just a small note to say a big
thank you to the stewards that
helped me at this years Union
Careers Fair, but especially to
Richard Scott, Andrew Wensley,
Christopher Stapleton and Steven
Newhouse for all the hard work that
they put in to make the event run
smoothly.
I have just read David Ensell's
letter... I suppose he must have a
grudge to bear given that he
resigned from being joint careers
fair manager with me this year, just
before he was to be sacked. The
lack of brochures was a problem on
the first day, due to an outside
company not perfect binding them
as quickly as they were supposed to.
Even so, everyone that was without
a brochure, was still given a plan
Boring
Dear Adam,
R E : 'Bailey's back and boring as
ever'. Felix letter p l 5 , Issue 913.
For boring, read vague, fuzzy,
obscure etc.
Perhaps A l a n could write back
and let us all know exactly what his
letter was driving at.
Methinks he was trying to be too
clever. Either that or a private joke.
Yours ad nauseum,
Declan Curry.

by the print unit, but due to a
problem, presumably were not
ready. A further 2,000 were
available on the second day, but this
means some 5 6 % of those attending
had no information provided them.
Unfortunate. Also please could you
elaborate on the 'large amount of
disorganisation preceding last
year's fair' and tell us in what way
it made it far inferior to this year's,
possibly by using the statistics of
attendances etc.
Yours sincerely,
David Ensell, Careers Fair
Steward 1991.
of the stand layout. Unfortunate,
but not a disaster.
A s for me saying that this year
was superior to last, this was a
slight reporting error by Felix, and
was in fact said by a company
representative from Rolls-Royce.
A n d as for the 'large amount of
disorganisation preceding last
year's fair', I'm afraid that I haven't
got the time, or space to write a 500
word essay. If D a v i d cannot
remember, then he should come and
see me at some time and I will
remind him.
A n y w a y , I hope that everyone
that came along looking for a job,
found something to their liking.
Yours sincerely.
Jeremy Burnell,
Careers Fair Manager 1991.
Dear Adam (again),
Firstly I would to say that my last
letter to Felix was not meant to be
at all rude. O f course you cannot
check the spelling of everything in
Felix, I don't expect you to. But as
Editor you should be made aware
when errors slip in, especially since
you are after all responsible for the
content of Felix.
It should have been obvious to
anyone reading my letter that it was
a blatant piece of club publicity,
which I felt we deserved after the
mistakes in Felix 912. I guess you
could describe my letter as ' n a f f ,
whatever that means. However,
Dear Adam,
O n Thursday 17 October 1991
after the Mathematics Freshers'
Dinner there was an attempt by
C & G to steal Theta, the R C S
mascot. In the ensuing confusion a
first year member of the R C S
mascotry team was unfortunately
injured.
First aid was administered by
students and the St J o h n ' s
Ambulance (from the Albert Hall)
until the ambulance arrived to take
him to hospital.
It is clear that the mascotry within
IC has lost sight of its original aim
to raise money for Rag, and has
Dear Adam,
After a number of incidents at last
Friday's Spitfire gig in the union,
I feel compelled to write on behalf
o f the Ents committee, everybody
else involved in running Ents events
and the people who attend them.
W h y do we constantly have to put
up with the b l o o d y - m i n d e d
behaviour of a small number of
people who seem to believe that
they enjoy some kind of priviledged
status within I C U , and as such are
exempt from the normal standards
of behaviour? I'm loath to point the
finger at specific bodies within
college but most people at IC are
familiar with the members of quasi-
masonic tie clubs, certain sports
clubs and C C U s to whom I refer.
Let me put a few things straight:
If you want to get into an Ents
event, P A Y , like everybody else
does. Persistent arguing will nof get
what I find totally unacceptable
from a person in your position is
c a l l i n g I C S F m e m b e r s
'trainspotters'. The committee and
I were most offended. Need I
remind you that a lot of your staff
are icsf members. A r e they too
'trainspotters'?
I might point out that there were
another two 'mistakes' in Felix 913
to do with I C S F events (running
total: 4 in the last two issues). But
since substituting RubberCap for
RoboCop II was quite funny I won't
mention them.

become out of hand. Therefore all
mascotry activities have been
suspended until further notice.
There will be a meeting on
Monday 28 October to review all
aspects of mascotry. If anybody has
any strong views on this matter
please put them in w r i t i n g ,
addressed to either Richard Murray
(RCS VP) or Lucia Clipstone ( C & G
VP). The results of this meeting will
be made known at the earliest
opportunity.
Yours sincerely.

you in. T r y i n g to 'charge the door'
will nor get you in. (Please—do not
take that as a challenge.)
W h y is it so hard for you to
b e h a v e like r e a s o n a b l e and
intelligent human beings? If you
want aggro, kindly piss off and find
it elsewhere.
Finally—to the erstwhile owner
o f two large pools o f vomit
deposited near the central staircase
toilets at around 8pm last Friday
(8pm! I ask you)—I think you owe
an apology to Andy the bar manager
and his staff for mopping up the
mess.
Y o u ' r e fucking pathetic.
