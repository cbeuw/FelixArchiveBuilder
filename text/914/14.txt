Rifle Club FilmSoc Imperial: A Godless College
For a trial period, at a sports centre
near you, the shooting club will be
opening on Thursday lunchtimes
(12.30 - 2.00pm) to shoot rifles.
Yes, rifle shooting has finally
started. N o previous experience is
necessary and anyone who proves
to be even halfway good at it will
probably end up on the rifle team.
( W e have some matches
approaching).
Incidently, this isn't just a
message to all the blokes out there.
Shooting is one of the truly equal
opportunity sports. A l l that is
required is the ability to lie still,
concentrate and move one finger.
A l l the universities we shoot against
have mixed teams, so why not us?
C ' m o n ladies, join the shooting club
and pretend you're Sigourney
Weaver!
By the way, would the petty
minded little git, who has been
going around college taking down
shooting club posters as fast as
we've been putting them up, like to
come down to the range (in the
sports centre) sometime. There's a
pick-axe handle that would very
much like to get acquainted.
I have a disease of the mind. It is
not generally regarded as serious,
certainly not terminal, and yet it is
extremely widespread.
Freud would be disgusted with
me for I know that it is a totally
irrational, purely psychological
fear.
It is this; anything with eight legs
scares me witless.
W h y should this be? I know that
spiders cannot hurt me and yet the
sight of one more than about a
quarter of an inch in leg radius
requires my use of a mains
pacemaker.
I have a theory as to why this
should be the case, and I believe
that for too long the simple arachnid

F o r H a l l o w e e n , the F i l m s o c
presentation will be Stephen King's
excellent thriller, Misery. The story
concerns a best selling author
(James Caan), who is rescued from
a car accident in the middle of
nowhere by his number one fan
(Kathy Bates). She nurses him
better, but discovers her favourite
character is being killed off in the
next novel. Being a rather unstable
person she resorts to rather drastic
measures to ensure that the book is
re-written. Kathy Bates received a
w e l l - d e s e r v e d o s c a r for her
performance. I'm sure she didn't
threaten any of the judges with her
sledgehammer, which she puts to
rather painful use in the film. T h e
show starts at 7.30pm in M e c h E n g
220, Thursday 31 October.
The first film is free for new
m e m b e r s ( m e m b e r s h i p £ 6 ) ,
otherwise it's 80p for members and
£1.80 for non-members. We're also
on the lookout for some people to
help out on the committee, if you're
interested, please could you come
along a bit earlier and find out what
it would involve.
This is the title of the talk that will
be given by the founder of the T . H .
Huxley Society, Michael Newman,
on Thursday at 12.45 in Huxley
(!!!) 340. W e are a Humanist
society - so why are we called the
Huxley Society? A n d why this title
for the talk? Moreover, what is
Humanism?
Humanism is an attitude to life
that is based on atheism or
agnosticism (Huxley coined this
word), but which goes further than
this negative statement of non-
belief. Humanists believe that life
is all that we can be sure about and
that therefore we should strive to
make our lives and those of others
as good as possible. T h e Humanist
philosophy started in ancient Greece
with Protagoras and has developed
since, greatly aided by the advent
of rationalism and science... and
now there is an International!
Humanist Movement.
T h e H u m a n i s t m o v e m e n t
campaigns for, amongst other
things: H u m a n Rights, freedom of
s p e e c h , s e c u l a r i s i n g state
institutions and laws (eg Sunday
T r a d i n g ) , equality, a b o r t i o n ,
voluntary euthanasia. However, the
movement is not well known or
represented and consequently the
religious lobby has a much greater
influence on society.
Huxley was a great figure in the
history of IC. he was also a great
scientist (and was D a r w i n ' s
" B u l l d o g " ) and " l i b e r a l ' '
educator. He was also a great
Humanist, and it was for these
reasons that H u x l e y is the
" s y m b o l " of the IC humanist
Society. He, and others in the IC
Humanist tradition, would be
surprised to find that in this science
college there are so many people in
the various religious groups -
especially the Christian U n i o n !
There must be more Humanists
"out there"... if so, our society will
represent your views.
So, are you a Humanist? D o you
know enough about Humanism to
decide? D o you know what the
Huxley Society is really all about?
C o m e along to the meeting and find
out, and hear a talk about the
Humanist (and especially IC)
tradition and its future, and then
we'll adjourn to the U n i o n bar!
Arachnophobia
has been seriously underestimated.
I urge the reader (who may suffer
from a similar affliction) to consider
the following points:
Primarily, why do the damn
things always turn up at the least
expected moment. Recently, I
moved a small pile of housebricks
by hand, fully expecting a black
hairy thing to leap out at me at any
m o m e n t . H o w e v e r , no s u c h
creature emerged (unless next
door's cat is classed as such). That
evening, I was sitting in the lounge
at home when one walked across
the wall about three feet away from
me, so big it was pulling the plaster
off the wall. What the hell was it
doing in there?
Secondly, why do they get so
big? Is there any need for this? Is
it caused by nuclear fallout from
Chernobyl, creating a mutant race
of super-spiders? I think it is just
pure vindictiveness for they know
that this is one area in which size
is important.
Thirdly, why do they never
manifest themselves until you need
to go within millimetres of them,
urgently? F o r example, for months
you could use the lavatory without
thinking about it. A n d then, one
day, you get caught short on the
tube, dash home with a bladder the
size of a beach ball, and what is
sitting on the rim of the toilet
grinning at you?
I don't like killing animals of any
kind. I w o n ' t kill an insect
k n o w i n g l y . But s p i d e r s are
different. Below a certain size it's
me or them—they have to go.
A b o v e a certain size and they are
quite safe, because I'm not going
near them.
In what is supposed to be a planet
dominated by the human race, there
are certain small creatures that can
control our lives (well, mine, at
least). This cannot be a coincidence.
I think they know of their powers
and are working at this very
moment to overthrow humanity.
They wouldn't have to try too hard
in my case.
O h , and another thing. They run
so bloody fast. A n d they can
disguise themselves as tomato
crowns and sit on the kitchen floor.
The one thing I am grateful for at
the moment is that they can't fly.
Yet.
