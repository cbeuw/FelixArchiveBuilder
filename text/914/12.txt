ago by students at Imperial to
provide a confidential listening and
information service for students.

A Guide to the Fair
Make use of the
stalls to get fit,
stop smoking
and improve
your sex life.
Testing for HIV
W h e n the body is infected with
A i d s , it reacts by producing
antibodies which can be detected in
the blood. If a test produces a
positive result, i.e. H I V Positive.
However, a negative result does not
necessarily mean that a person has
not got the virus. Antibodies take,
on average two to three months to
develop, so if you think you may
have contracted A i d s over the last
few months it may be too early for
them to show up on the test.
The decision about whether or
not you have the A i d s Test needs
careful thought. Just having the test,
whatever the result, can affect your
chance of getting life assurance. If
you feel that you would like to have
a test, for peace of mind, you can
discuss it with the representative
from the Health Centre.
The Smear Test
Cervial Cancer kills 2,000 women
every year in the U K , with the vast
majority never having had a cervial
smear test. The disease is however,
nearly always preventable, which is
why it is so important that any
woman who has ever had sexual
intercourse should have a cervical
smear test.
The earlier you start having
sexual intercourse, the greater the
risk of developing cervical cancer.
U s i n g a b a r r i e r m e t h o d o f
contraception, like a condom or
diaphragm, every time you have sex
will help to protect the cervix from
possible infection by viruses, and
may thus reduce the risk.
Cancer of the cervix can be
prevented if changes in the cells
which precede it are treated. A
cervical smear test will determine
whether the cells are normal or not
and if the smear is 'abnormal'
further investigation will take place.
It is very important that women
have regular smear tests every three
to five years—so if you would like
to find out more about having a
c e r v i c a l smear test the
representative from the Health
Centre will be able to advise.
The service that we provide every
night of term from 6pm to 8am is
twofold: firstly we will listen in a
non-judgemental and non-directive
manner providing you with a
chance to sort out how you feel or
what you want to do when faced
with a difficult situation; secondly,
and of equal importance, is our
information service on anything
from What's O n in L o n d o n or train
times to contraception issues or late
night chemists.
Call us any night of term on
071-436 5561 or, if you want to
help, the see us at the fair.
3. Alcohol
What's wrong with having a drink
now and then?
Probably nothing, if that's what
it is—having a drink now and then.
There are many reasons why we
drink. Most people say the drink to
enjoy themselves and to help them
relax with family or friends. Others
say they drink because there's
nothing better to do, or they're
depressed. It could be anything.
Drinking is all about being
sociable, but it depends on how
much and why you drink. If you
don't go over the limit then you can
probably be more lively and
friendly. But it's obvious, usually
at a pub or party, who's had too
much to drink because they really
aren't worth talking to! They either
make total idiots of themselves or
end up in a fight.
If you want to enjoy drinking you
need to be aware of when you've
had enough? Counting your alcohol
'units' is a good way to watch your
drinking habits. Find out more
about alcohol and the limits at the
Health Fair. There is also a
computer analysis game on alcohol
which, with your unit control score,
will tell you what affect your
drinking is having on your body and
your pocket.
4. Exercise
W h y bother exercising?
Plan
for exercising. If you want to find
out how fit you are then come along
to the exercise stand, where y o u ' l l
have the opportunity to do some
exercise and check your heart rate.
5. Healthy Eating
A brief guide to healthy eating:
• Cut down on fat, sugar and salt
• Eat more fibre-rich foods
• Eat plenty of fresh fruit and veg
• Get plenty of variety
But how do you know if your diet
is really healthy and how do you set
about changing your diet? This stall
has information and advice to help

6. Smoking
There is no magic way to give up
smoking. People find their own
ways to give up, but many ex-
smokers, both heavy and light
smokers have found this general
advice helpful.
1. Prepare yourself. Think about
when and where you usually have
a cigarette. Once you've stopped
smoking, these times and places are
going to be the danger spots, so
work out how you are going to deal
with them.
2. Pick a day. Set a target day for
giving up. M a k e it a day when you
will not be under much stress.
3. Stop. G i v e up and don't smoke
any cigarettes. Take one day at a
time. Every day without a cigarette
is a success.
Nine out of ten ex-smokers gave up
entirely on their own. But if you've
tried before and found it very
difficult you might find one of these
aids helpful: nicotine chewing gum
(available on prescription only)
other chewing gums and tables,
acupuncture or hypnosis, you could
also come along to the G i v i n g U p
Smoking Seminar on Friday.

talk to an expert or to one of the
stress relaxation sessions that have
been organised.
8. Welfare Office
At some stage of your time at
Imperial College you may need
advice or information and not know
where to turn. T h e answer could
well be waiting at the Welfare
Advisory Service. Situated in the
Union Office in Beit Quad, Stefano
Ruis, the Union Welfare Adviser is
available to answer your questions,
see page eleven for opening times.
Most of us are in debt. W e may
have a credit card, a storecard, an
overdraft or may get credit from the
fuel companies and B T by paying
bills on a quarterly basis. A recent
survey found that only 15% of
adults knew what an A n n u a l
Percentage Rate ( A P R ) was,
suggesting that many take out credit
with no understanding of what it
may cost them.
Debt is nothing new to students.
Figures compiled by the National
U n i o n of Students (NUS) show it
was almost impossible for students
with no extra income beyond a full
grant and full student loan to stay
Employment. This phenomenon is
by no means limited to overseas
students—a survey compiled last
autumn found that more than a tenth
of university undergraduates have
to combine study with employment
during term time in order to finance
their way through higher education.
It is impossible to predict
accurately how much a student will
need to live on each week or each
month. G i v e n the variety o f
lifestyles, course requirements,
housing costs, travel expenses and
of course the amount of money
available, to suggest a figure would
be meaningless. T o make the most
Money Matters
in credit last year. Soaring rent
levels in London push the resources
of the capital's students to their
limits. Coupled with the high cost
of living, many find it difficult to
make ends meet and so get into debt
sooner rather than later.
If you are a home student,
studying for your first degree, then
you are likely to be getting either
a mandatory award, a discretionary
award or an allowance from the
Training C o m m i s s i o n .
Grants have been frozen this
year, following the introduction of
student loans which are designed to
supplement the basic grant. F r o m
now o n , the basic student
maintenance grant will remain at
1990/91 levels; the loan element,
meanwhile, will increase each year
until it forms 5 0 % of the grant
income. If you are a home student,
on a full-time undergraduate course
and aged less than 50 when the
course began a loan is automatically
on offer. The most you can borrow
this year is £660 (£460 if you live
at home; final year students cannot
borrow as much though) and
applications are limited to one per
year per student. M o r e information
can be found in the leaflet 'Student
Grants and L o a n s ' available form
I C U ' s Welfare Office.
Financial problems are not solely
restricted to home undergraduate
students. With the withdrawal of
benefits f r o m most f u l l - t i m e
students it is l i k e l y that
postgraduates will also feel the
p i n c h . O v e r s e a s students,
meanwhile may have very limited
funding or be self-financing. T h e
high prices to be found in L o n d o n
have meant that many must seek to
supplement their limited income,
often by seeking part-time work
having obtained prior permission
f r o m the D e p a r t m e n t o f
of what you have got though, you
may want to do your own budgeting
calculations. In this way you can
estimate your expenditure over the
year, though you should bear in
mind that monthly (or weekly)
outgoings will not necessarily be
uniform. B y setting aside a small
amount of time each week to work
out your finances you may find you
avoid problems later on in the term.
This is by no means ideal for
everyone though and care should be
taken to find a system that suits you.
If you need to go into debt though,
however large or small the amount,
it is a good idea to speak with your
bank manager before he or she asks
to see you.
For those that do get into
financial difficulty, it is worth
bearing in mind that by taking
advice early you may then avoid
more complicated problems later
on. If you do experience financial
problems and this is having an
affect on your studies you should
always keep your personal tutor
informed. This way any extenuating
circumstances can be taken into
account when y o u r w o r k is
assessed. If you need advice contact
the U n i o n Welfare Office for help.
Whatever you do, don't try to cope
alone with what can be a very
upsetting and d e m o r a l i s i n g
experience.
Remember that debt is rarely
caused by irresponsible behaviour.
The biggest single factor leading to
financial difficulty is a sudden
reduction in i n c o m e and the
consequent difficulties in meeting
commitments. Alternatively, an
u n e x p e c t e d increase in y o u r
essential needs m a y r e q u i r e
a d d i t i o n a l e x p e n d i t u r e . H e l p
yourself by seeking advice as early
as you can.
