A Day Too Long
T h e College day seems likely to be
extended by an hour, after the
second report of the working party
dealing with the matter. T h e
proposal is that teaching hours be
extended from the present 9.30am
to 5.30pm to a period running from
9.00am to 6.00pm.
The paper gives a run down of
the reaction to the proposals from
the departments and states that
although 'student opinion was
wholly opposed to the change', that
' w e k n o w o f no systematic
expression of students' views'. This
despite the various referendums
conducted by the various student
unions of Imperial College.
T h e cost of the change will play
the most important part in the
College's decision about whether to
make the change to the length of the
academic working day, according
to the report. It quotes that staff
costs in academic departments will
be a r o u n d £ 5 3 , 0 0 0 and an
additional cost of £23,000 for the
College Nursery. This appears to be
a m i n i m u m costing of the situation
as it is not known whether staff cost
figures from the departments
i n c l u d e d s u p e r a n n u a t i o n
contributions or not.
It is unknown whether the longer
day will present a problem to the
already stretched College Estates
Department. Although a letter from
the Managing Director, G o r d o n
Marshall, promises that 'the extra
costs will be next to nothing',
details are unclear. A full set of
estimates have been prepared by the
department but the paper states that
'it has not been possible for us to
see them.'.
A s it is, the matter has been
undecided until the next Board of
Studies meeting on the 11th
December. Whichever way the
Board decides, it seems that Student
opinion is not going have a large
effect on the outcome.
Rag Total
Rag's Great Sightseeing Challenge
on Saturday raised £1,424.79 for
the United Nations Childrens Fund,
U N I C E F . This brings the Rag total
to £12,700.
Late LEA's
M a n y students around the country
have not yet r e c e i v e d their
maintenance grants from their Local
Education Authorities ( L E A ) . T h e
L E A s claim this is because of a
government directive that tuition
fees are to be paid first, while the
government claims this delay is due
to L E A inefficiency.
New Glider for ICU
O f the total cost, the U n i o n only
contributed £11,000, with a further
£17,000 from the Harlington Trust,
which was set up with profits from
gravel extraction at the former
Harlington Sports Grounds. T h e
remaining £17,000 was raised by
the club itself by the sale of its Club
Libelle glider and shares in a
Lasham trainer, as part of their five-
year plan.
T h e Grob 103 is available for
training to club members, and for
trial flights to anyone who is
interested. Trial flights cost £21 for
the day. See the What's On page for
details.
Super-Solar-Cell
Imperial College U n i o n Gliding
C l u b have recently acquired a high
performance dual seat glider. T h e
glass-fibre glider cost £45,000 and
is IC's only dual glider. Previously,
the club had to hire dual gliders
from the flying site at Lasham.
T h e G r o b 103C arrived from
Germany on 8th Oct and first flew
last weekend. It is the first of its
type in this country. Its arrival was
very timely as Lasham's own G103
was written off in a heavy landing
that week. T h e I C U Gliding C l u b
decided to buy the aircraft two years
ago when Lasham decided not to
convert to glass-fibre gliders,
leaving IC with two solo glass-fibre
gliders but no dual trainer. T h e
glider was eventually ordered in
January when the Union funds were
made available.

conventional power sources like
coal and oil, it has been reported
this week.
T w o reports, one from Imperial
College, have forced scientists to
rethink their attitudes to an energy
source once thought to be confined
to cheap calculators.
D o c t o r K e i t h B a r n h a m o f
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e P h y s i c s
Department announced his results
in the S E R C ( S c i e n c e and
Engineering Research Council)
Bulletin. His method involves an
improvement on conventional solar
cells. In the improved cells thin
layers of semi-conductor material
only 50 atoms thick are added to
form 'quantum wells' which trap
higher energy electrons than the
normal cell. T h e process is so
effective that a cell containing fifty
quantum wells is twice as efficient
as one with thirty. Doctor Barnham
said that the new cells could be
produced 'at little extra cost' than
normal cells
Doctor Bryan O'Reagan and
Doctor Michael Gratzel of the
S w i s s F e d e r a l Institute o f
Technology published their results
in Nature. They claim to be able to
improve the efficiency of Solar cells
on cloudy days. This is caused by
the surface of the sun absorbing the
larger range of light frequencies
produced during an overcast day.
Theft
A number of thefts have occured at
IC this week. A mountain bike
belonging to Reggie Blennerhassett,
ex I C U finance officer, was taken
from Prince's Gardens. Another
mountain bike was stolen from the
Huxley building on Queensgate.
A student's car was broken into
and seriously damaged in an attempt
to steal the radio.
A student found the lock on his
locker had been changed. H e called
security who removed the lock,
finding the contents, including a
suit, had been removed.
Additionally, a Psion Organiser
and instruction booklet were
pilfered from the Aeronautics
Department. Both items were left in
an unoccupied office.
T h e C i v i l Engineering computer
room was broken into for the
second time this term. Another
Naga processor worth over £1500
has been taken. The wires had been
severed in order to remove it.
Terry Briley, security officer,
said 'people should contact security
if they want advice on securing
valuable items', as well as re-
iterating his warning that things
should not be left out so they can
be stolen.
Virtuality
T h e Science M u s e u m will be
holding a lecture by H o w a r d
Rheingold on 'virtual reality' at
2.30pm, today Friday 25th. Entry
to the Science M u s e u m is free on
production of an IC U n i o n Card.
