Mortal Thoughts
Alan Rudolph, cult director of films
such as Choose Me, The Moderns
and more recently Love at Large,
now gives us his twelfth feature—
Mortal Thoughts.
In the movie, Cynthia (Demi
Moore) and Joyce (Glenne Headly),
play childhood friends who run a
beauty salon together, while raising
children and coping with their
husbands.
Headly's husband James, played
by Bruce Willis, is so abusive,
aggressive and loud, that most
people who meet h i m wish he
would drop dead. James subjects his
wife to a torrent o f physical and
verbal abuse, and seems only
interested in getting stoned or
drunk. So when early on in the
movie, James is murdered and his
body dumped in a ditch, family and
friends feel everything from relief
to sorrow to guilt.
T h e story is told in a series o f
flashbacks, as M o o r e recounts the
events leading up to James's murder
during an interview she is giving
voluntarily to the police.
A s the murder investigation
closes in, the strain begins to take
its toll o n the two w o m e n ' s
relationship, and friendship and
morality begin to clash with the
instinct for survival.
A s a thriller which revolves
around the murder of Willis's
character, the move does not work
very well, with the 'twist' in the plot
becoming quite obvious about ten
minutes before it is revealed.
A l a n Rudolph's strength as a
director has always been the way in
which he handles the relationship
between his characters, and Mortal
Thoughts is a good example of this.
Rudolph's direction is at times
heavy handed, and his frequent use
of slow motion ends up being
tedious, but what he does manage
to do is allow the interplay o f his
characters to make up for the lack
of narrative strength in the move.
Mortal Thoughts is quite a
downbeat movie, which relies
heavily on the performances o f its
principle players. Bruce Willis is
quite c o n v i n c i n g as J o y c e ' s
complete animal of a husband
(although at times the famous Willis
cheeky grin gets a little tiring) and
unlike her recent lightweight roles
in movies such as Dick Tracy,
Headly here demonstrates her
considerable talent as James's long
suffering wife.
However this is really D e m i
M o o r e ' s show, as it is her
performance that holds the movie
together. Despite looking like she's
just stepped off the cover of Vogue,
Moore is surprisingly convincing as
the m i d d l e - c l a s s h a r d w o r k i n g
woamn, and her performance lends
the m o v i e some considerable
dramatic weight.
Harvey Kietel, as the police
detective also lends fine support,
despite the fact that he is essentially
reprising the character and the suit
he had in Theima and Louise.
Mortal Thoughts has its flaws,
and as a murder mystery it is a bit
of a non-starter, but thanks to some
very good acting, it is nonetheless
an interesting and watchable
character study.
The Don.
Rambling Rose Invisible
Rambling Rose, starring Laura
Dern, Diane Ladd and Robert
Duvall was written eighteen years
ago. T o say that it has taken this
long to make it to the big screen
must surely arouse a question as to
why? W h y not just leave it to gather
dust instead of resurrecting an
already lame story and subjecting
poor cinema-goers to almost two
hours of boredom, ancient cliches
and unmemorable characters. It
must surely be someone's idea of
a joke. According to the producer,
Renny Harling, fresh from directing
Die Hard II—-Die Harder, he read
Rambling Rose in the hope that it
would help him fall asleep—I'm
surprised it didn't have that effect,
although like him, the story left me
crying too.
Rose ( D e r n ) , from a p o o r
background, joins the family o f
Duvall and L a d d as a maid in a
small Georgia town in 1935, after
being forced into prostitution at an
early age. Promiscuity, still being
her main interest, she continues to
lay every man in sight, or try to,
saying sweetly ' W o m e n don't want
s e x — t h e y just want l o v e ' .
Eventually she finds it, and marries
four times, before her not too
untimely death at the end o f the
film.
T h e film has been described as a
'tonic, piquant, absorbing and
uplifting'—it's true, I did have a
warm sensation in m y stomach, but
that was just the bile rising up inside
of me. This is just one film that
should have been left on the cutting
room floor—the actors gave it their
best, but sadly (?) the script let them
down. What more can I say? Given
a choice between seeing Rambling
Rose and doing a week's washing
up at London's busiest restaurant,
I know which I'd choose...now
where did I put the F a i r y . . . ?
Bill & Ben.
This., well, this video fails to fall
within the blinkered confines of the
word 'good' and 'bad' and invents
a strange, vague classification all of
its own. In fact, this would be a
great opportunity to say 'transcends
genre' except that I don't think it
would be very appropriate. O K , if
you want a pigeonhole, let's try
exploitation movie par excellance.
W e start with the eminently
p l a u s i b l e p r e m i s e that a
psychopathic biophysicist takes up
a teaching post in a remedial high
s c h o o l . S a i d g e n t l e m a n has
developed a serum which turns him
into a - you guessed it - invisible
maniac. Natch, he has a hangup of
the nether regions which leads to the
usual proliferation of garmentless
women and a bit of violence; most
of this is fairly pedestrian stuff, but
hey ! that's life, huh?
Anyway, there's not really a good
reason to watch this vid, but there's
a fair few bad ones, mostly to do
Maniac
with hormones. It's ethically
unsound and features a man choking
to death on a French loaf sandwich,
but don't let that put you off. I never
liked French loaves much anyway.
This is one of those bizarre films
that was made to laugh at, even
though it's completely straight all
the way through. Probably best
appreciated with taste circuits on
low.
Next week, in this place, we
move from sex ' n ' violence to
violence ' n ' sex with Street
A s y l u m !
