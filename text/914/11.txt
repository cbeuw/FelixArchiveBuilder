N o w that Freshers' Week is over
you have time to sit back and think
about your life as a student in terms
other than who you are going out
with tonight. This is the time when
real issues such as your health and
welfare should be considered.
That's why the Union has organised
the Welfare W e e k in order to give
you as much information as possible
about health and welfare issues so
that y o u c a n make informed
decisions about how you are going
to run the rest o f your life.
T h e r e are several different
m e t h o d s used to relay this
information. Seminars are the best
method for finding out: There are
four o f these based on different
issues and will be given by experts
from Riverside Health Authority.
T h e health fair o n Tuesday and
O P E N I N G
for personal callers
(no appointment necessary)
finance and budgeting fair on
Thursday will give you a chance to
look at displays, pick up leaflets and
ask about anything you're unsure
of. There will be a poster display
all week in the J C R with posters
informing y o u o f all the topics
covered during Welfare Week.
Once you've studied this material
there will be a test—the bar quiz on
Wednesday is for teams and will be
covering the lesser known health
issues! T o round off the whole week
and give you a chance to try out a
bit o f healthy living, the Union Bar
and S n a c k B a r a r e r u n n i n g
promotions. A l l hot veggie dishes
will be £1 and soft drinks are 50p
a pint. It takes very little effort to
gain something from Welfare Week
so try it out—you never know, you
may learn something.
