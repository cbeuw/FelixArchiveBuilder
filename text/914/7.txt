His Name is Alive -Home is in Your Head
Heartthrobs
-Total Abandon
I hate it when we get good records.
Apart from the soul- destroying
aspect of always saying nice things
about them, it never seems that we
can give them what they deserve.
1991 has been too good in a lot of
ways, and this is epitomised by this
e.p.: sharp, lush guitar pop, dreamy
female vocals, kind of like the
bunnymen adopting Vince Clarke's
idiosyncrasies and sung by The
Sundays' Harriet after smoking
something very, very harsh. Turn
Away has a cooler than most Byrds
feel, but my fave is Bright Green
Day, sumptuous and with a delicate
hint o f darkness, c h a r m i n g l y
funereal. Argggh. A fine effort.

Paris Angels
Brunei Academy
It's cold up North. Brunei Academy
is about twenty miles within the
arctic circle, and it's too cold to
shiver. However, coming from
M a n c y , I expect Paris Angels are
used to the cold. One of them,
Jayne, the singer, however is not
very well, and isn't here. C a n they
manage without her?
They start off okay enough, with
Scope and Fade, but they don't
really use her vocal on those
records anyway, but later into the
set, around about half way through,
they run out o f songs that don't
require her vocals, and start to
sound like a bad hybrid of the Farm
and Crappy Mondays, which is
precisely what they look like.
Perfume is, on record, Paris Angels
good song, like Ride have Taste,
and Blur have Bang. However,
without Jayne, Perfume is a
shambolic mess which they would
have been advised to forget about
altogether. It's the aural equivalent
of E v e l y n Gardens. F u l l marks for
trying, but the results are poor.

headlong rush into all conceivable
psychodramas. H i s Name is Alive
is the stubborn and enigmatic
monicker for the brainchild of
Warren Defever, a recent visitor to
these waters (he's from Michigan)
and one, to m y lasting annoyance,
who went back stateside before I
could corner him. D a m n clever
move, David.
T h e opening track, 'are y o u
c o m i n g d o w n this weekend?'
consists of this line being sung twice
by the exquisitely somnolent voice
of K a r i n Oliver and lasting for
approximately ten seconds. I advise
you to remember this; it's crucial
to the whole plot. Twenty-five
tracks in all, all minuscule, all
oblique; but all hitting solid targets.
Should I be concerned that this
probably says more about me than
the music? I think not. Empathy
feels particularly uncomfortable as
Rosetta Stone -U
the stark, angelic voices intone the
lines 'Does your chest explode all
full of her? Where has your head
gone (I should nail it to her door)'.
'The Charmer', sharply replaced by
a fractured buzzsaw guitar and
pounding drum patterns abruptly
cut short and running into a fevered
paranoia with 'There's something
between us and he's changing my
words'. This review is verging on
the peripatetic, the psychotic and
wholly insubstantial, but it's like a
mirror, exploding into a million
fragments and being pieced together
again, but wrongly, and with each
fragment still retaining its original
image - a nightmarish jumble flaked
with the spectre of serendipity, but
nonetheless quite b e a u t i f u l l y
hideous (meant as a sincere
compliment). I mean, I'd soon die
alone than go through the horror of
' A r e we still M a r r i e d ? ' .
Tranquillity becomes taut, angelic
becomes evil, 'Chances are we are
mad' is simultaneously terrifying
and drowsy, a lull and lullaby that
will kill you, and hypothermia with
a disembodied vocal and plangent
nderworld
What in the world possessed me
to leave behind the drunken stupor
of the Freshers New Year Party for
the Arctic wastes of Camden? I
could have been passing out quietly
under a vile green cocktail instead
of fighting for breath in the crowded
throng and smoke. Was it worth
it..'.?
Monday at the Underworld. Dark
and sleazy. Just like home. Tonight
hosted the fabled Rosetta Stone. But
first the hoards of the night were
treated to Restoration, the greatest
thing since The Nephs first emerged
from Badlands. They could be in
for some serious competition with
this band's progress.
But now, the Rosetta addicts
could revel in their hour. With their
first album out now, Rosetta Stone
are maturing. Their sound is more
complex and interesting as they
entwine a new keyboard and guitar
with complex modulations, leaving
Missionaries to play 'Spot T h e
Difference'. T h e single, An Eye
For The Main Chance, is out now.
The compelling open shines through
to the contagious chorus. Guess
what? I like this band! G o and see
them at U L U on October 31th (All
Hallow's E v e as they prefer to call
it — no ' b a d - g * * h ' pretensions
here!) and you'll be envied for the
rest o f your days.
T h e Heretic
acoustic guitar work laid over that
demonic buzzsaw guitar. A s we
move through 'Sitting still moving
still staring outlooking', there's
another blood-chilling lyric around
the corner; ' N o w in fragments
we're alone, there's a sliver in the
soul, A l l I can remember since we
splintered on our o w n ' . ' V e r y Bad
a Bitter H a n d ' . A s the sudorific
'Spirit and B o d y ' fires off on its
m i s s i l e t r a j e c t o r y , I feel
m a r v e l l o u s l y g u i l t y , t r u l y
insensitive, a contrived human
being- 'seeing myself fall away only
to be undying'- facing such a
m a g n i t u d e o f s e n s i t i v i t y .
Interpretation is everything, you
know, but ' H o m e is in your H e a d '
is everything interpreted and I'm
willing to bet that I will not hear
another record like this ever again
in my lifetime.
Defever has presented me with
something bizarre, wonderful, and
thrilling, narcotic, hypnotic, always
beautiful, always confusing. So I
didn't get to interview him. So
what. M y home is his.

Erasure -Chorus
two years came in an annoying
digipak on C D . T h e y get on m y
wick.
It signals a return to the bleak
electropop of V i n c e Clarke's days
with Y a z o o , shying away from the
comparitively lush orchestration of
W i l d ! , with A n d y Bell speaking
more than singing through much of
this album and with the bleeps and
fizzes so much in evidence on the
single present throughout the disc.
The title track is a masterpiece of
green pop, but similar genius is only
in evidence once more in the album.
The first 'side' slips into mediocrity
from then on, with no tracks of any
great consequence. 'Side B ' is
better. T h e high chart placing of
' L o v e to Hate Y o u ' directly relates
to the state of the charts today, as
it is the worst single that Erasure
have ever released. 'Turns the love
to anger' is better, but the only time
Erasure's spark really returns is in
the penultimate track 'Perfect
Stranger", and if this isn't a sing'e,
mute records deserve to be eaten
alive. Chorus could have been so
g o o d , but it o n l y shines
occasionally.
