More Money Raised by IC Rag
Hiya, it's Penguin the Rag
C h a i r m a n (again). W e l l last
Saturday was The Great Sightseeing
Challenge and let's not beat about
the bush, it certainly was Great.
There were over 80 people taking
part and we raised £1,400 for
U N I C E F , who in case you haven't
heard help bundles of kiddies in
poor counties; well worth a good
donation any day.
So U N I C E F were happy and we
were happy. But what were we
actually happy about? W e l l the
general idea was a Sightseeing Tour
around L o n d o n but with the slight
catch that you only got told where
the next sight was when you had
completed a small, but definitely
amusing challenge. So we ended up
with teams piggy-backing around
the Cutty Sark, dancing on bus
shelters outside B B C T V Centre
and trying to obtain items of ladies'
u n d e r w e a r outside St P a u l ' s
Cathedral.
A s only about 80 people took
part, a lot of people have already
asked me if I was disappointed with
such a drop in numbers from the
2 5 0 + that p a r t i c i p a t e d in
M o n o p o l y . O n the contrary, I was
more than pleased with the turn out.
There had been a U L U all- nighter
the night before, it was the first day
of the freeze- your-wotsits-off
weather and the Biology department
were off on a field-trip. Despite all
this, 80 people went out, had a
really fun day in the cold and raised
a lot of money for a worthy charity
in the process. That's what Rag's
all about and I'm happy. M y only
regret is that more of you didn't
take part in what proved to be a
great day. A h well, you'll know for
next time.
T h e winning team would have
been that led by last year's top
collector Martin Heighway, but due
to personally fiddling with the
penalties awarded to his team, the
team were disqualified. M a n y
members of the team did however
pick up prizes for the amount that
they raised on the day. There were,
as a result, 3 winning teams : T h e
Bloody W e l l Should Be In France;
Phyllis (With Biological Action)
and T h e Einsteins. They will all
receive prizes, including an A to Z
G u i d e o f L o n d o n e a c h , an
invaluable accessory for any
L o n d o n student, 15 of which A to
Z kindly donated.
In the evening a load of Rags
from other universities around the
country descended on Imperial for
a party organised by U N I C E F . The
evening was a great social event and
it was good to see most of our
collectors attending. Southampton
had the largest turnout of the day,
with about 150 students. This meant
that the female to male ratio was the
largest that I've ever seen in the
U n i o n Snack Bar. Southampton
raised about £1,800 during the day,
which proves that on a total per
head we can still come out best.
M a n y thanks go to all that helped
on the day, but special thanks must
go to Laurie, Beccy and Aled whose
jobs as marshals were made
considerably harder than others by
lack of company in the cold
weather.
There were a great deal of ways
that the event could have been
improved, but for a first attempt I'm
really pleased with its success. It's
definitely something that we'll do
again.
P.S. It was good to see two of the
U n i o n Sabbaticals helping as
marshals and enjoying themselves
in the process.
Sightseers on the run again.
Raggies visit Buck House.
That's more or less all the big Rag
events over for now. There are,
however, for those of you with a
taste for what Rag's about, enough
things for you to take part in until
Rag Week arrives. (Read the article
if you haven't already.)
Today, presuming that you're
reading this on Friday, you take
part in our City of L o n d o n Pub
C r a w l . A r m e d with a Rag C a n
(collecting box), the idea is for
teams of up to 4 to locate 8 pubs
within the City, collecting from rich
folk on the way. Y o u can register
either at today's Rag Meeting
(Union Lounge, 12.40pm), at the
Union Office during the afternoon,
or at the Rag Office from 5.30pm
onwards. F o r those serious about
either drinking, collecting or just
having fun, it's a must.
O n Sunday, we have a collecting
licence for Covent Garden Market.
Y o u really must be in fancy dress,
but that hasn't been a problem for
many people at previous events. If
you're interested come to the Rag
Meeting today or contact me on
Saturday on Fisher Hall ext 406.
After all this, there's Hallowe'en
(college fun), Bonfire Night (a
q u i c k c o l l e c t i o n b e f o r e the
fireworks at Battersea) and the
Poppy Day collection (Sat 9th Nov)
followed in the evening by a
Leukaemia Research Pub Crawl.
So, Be M a d , Be Silly & Be Part
O f It! Cheers

P.S. Don't forget, there's our Rag
meeting every Friday in the U n i o n
Lounge at 12.40pm. Everybody's
welcome, so come along and find
out how to get roped into helping
organise and take part in all of what
Rag has to offer this year.
