when under stress. (It was during
a rough body search of Dalton's
elder brother Joseph, whom he
idolised, when he shot the police
officer.) Dalton had been brought
up by an alcoholic aunt after his
mother abandoned him when he
was two weeks old. His aunt beat
him frequently and as a child he
exhibited signs of paranoia and
violence. None of these facts were
investigated during his trial.
Only in three states, Delaware,
Oklahoma and South Dakota, is age
not listed as a m i t i g a t i n g
circumstance in the death penalty
statutes. In eighteen of the 24 states
that pass sentences of death on
juveniles, age could be mentioned
as a mitigating factor at the
sentencing part of the trial. In many
cases, as in the Prejean case,
however, it is not.

backgrounds, many have low
intelligence (and are sometimes
mentally retarded) with most
showing signs o f p s y c h i a t r i c
disorders. These factors make them
less able to act rationally under
stress and make them extremely
susceptible to influences from older
people. (In many cases juveniles
committed the -crimes in the
presence of older peers.) It is
difficult to see how the death
penalty w o u l d deter such an
offender. It has also been found that
j u v e n i l e offenders are v e r y
r e s p o n s i v e to e d u c a t i o n and
psychiatric treatment whilst on
death row. M a n y begin to learn to
read and write and some even take
up correspondence courses while
the long legal process of appeals is
carried out (many years can be
spent waiting for execution).
Amnesty International argues that
with the imposition of the death
penalty there is no chance of
reform, no chance for the offender
to give something back to society.
This is especially true of young
offenders. Before his execution
Dalton Prejean expressed remorse
for his crime and explained 'I've
changed. There's a whole lot of
difference between being 17 and
30'. With reference to his nine year
old son he said, 7 think about
Cleveland's (the police officer)
children, the fact they don't have a
father either.' In his final statement
he again referred to the police
officer's family: 'To the Cleveland
family, they say it wasn't for the
revenge but it's hard for me to see,
to understand...I hope they're
happy.'
Despite all the facts highlighted
the cruel nature of the death penalty
and International S t a n d a r d s
prohibiting the execution of youths
under 18 years of age, some 24
states and even the U S Supreme
Court still insist that the execution
of juveniles is permissible. (In 1989
the Supreme Court reinforced this
view in a ruling that execution of
offenders as young as 16 is
permissible under the constitution).
