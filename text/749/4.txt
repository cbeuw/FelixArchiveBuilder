Christine Taig's
Subterranean UGM Blues
Thanks to anyone who DID turn up
to the UGM on Tuesday - it's just a
pity there weren't more of you.
Maybe next time.... Following a
motion at that UGM, the Union will
no longer be booking out rooms to
clubs and societies at times clashing
with UGMs, except in special
circumstances (for instance if you've
booked a speaker ages in advance
and you can't get them to change the
date). This is not meant to be an
attack on clubs and societies, merely
a way of avoiding the Union cutting
its own throat, by leaving UGM
dates free for those who want to
attend. Clubs and societies are, after
all, part of the Union as a whole;
there's no reason why two facets of
the one organisation should be
competing against each other.
UGM dates for the year are: 4th
November, 2nd December, 15th
January, 10th February, 5th March,
12th March and 19th May.
Welfare Surgery
Anyone who has been to see Lesley
Gillingham, the Welfare Advisor, in
her office in Student Services will
realise that in fact she works in a
corridor -. which is not exactly
conducive to private conversations
about welfare matters. On
Wednesday afternoons between
1.30pm and 5.00pm you can now
visit Lesley in the Union Office,
where hopefully you'll get a bit more
privacy. Lesley can deal with
questions on housing benefits, grant
problems, visa problems and loads
of other things so if you need help,
come and see her - you don't need an
appointment.
Silwood Park
Many IC students don't realise that
there are over 100 full-time
postgraduates studying at the
College field station at Silwood
Park, near Ascot. Silwood's a really
nice place: a big, old house in
beautiful grounds (ignoring the
nuclear reactor for the time being)
but it's a bit out of the way and
Silwood students often get
completely neglected by the South
Kensington site. In an effort to
remedy this, the Union is hoping to
run minibuses or coaches to
Silwood for Friday evenings in the
Bar or major social events. To start
with there's a big party on Friday
17th October, to which we'll arrange
transport; anyone interested contact
Gareth Fish on 6289 or come and
ask in the Union Office.
ULU
Hopefully lots of women from IC
will manage to get to thefirstULU
Women Scientists and Engineers
meeting on Tuesday 14th October
organised by Jane Cannon, ULU
President. Details hopefully are on
the letters page. Jane is an engineer
herself (and an ex-student of
Professor Ash) so she knows what
she's talking about. It should be a
good meeting - see you there.
