THEATRE
Breaking The
Musical
Mould
Cabaret
Serious theatre-goers in London
are being forced to the far flying
recesses of the Royal Court,
Sloane Square and the Lyric and
Riverside studios in Hammer-
smith whilst the West End is
s t u f f e d f u l l of v a c a n t ,
commercial farce and musicals.
Cabaret at the Strand theatre
Aldwych has been running for a
few months now, and is a brave
attempt at breaking the London
muscial mould. It employs all the
usual techniques; expensive
sets, dazzling costume and
intensive choreography etc, but
it does have an advantage over
the likes of Chess in having a
p r o m i n a n t s t o r y l i n e . T h e
Heroine is nightclub singer and
hostess Sally Bowles (Kelly
Hunter) who falls for a visiting
Englishwoman, however there
are a few interesting sub-plots
and some stunning musical
numbers to stop it degenerating
into a run of the mill show. As it
s t a n d s C a b a r e t is g o o d
entertainment.
However there is no way that
this stage-production can avoid
being compared to the cult-
status movie version starring
Liza Minelli and suddenly it
starts to look weak. One of the
strengths of the film is the way it
s h o w s t h e n a i v e t y a n d
decadence of Berliners in the
30's against the terrifying rise of
the Nazis. This was a vital
e l e m e n t in C h r i s t o p h e r
Isherwoods short stories upon
which the whole musical was
based. The stage version has
ignored this and tried to cover-
up the gaps left with glitter.
The characters have, on the
whole, b e c o m e weak and
romanticized, with the exception
of Wayne Sleep at the Master of
ceremonies, although it is a
virtual impersonation of Joel
Grays film portrayal, Kelly
Hunter still manages to make the
a u d i e n c e tingle with her
rendition of the song Cabaret.
London Musicals are not
cheap to see, but if you want to
splash out on one then I would
recommend Cabaret. However a
far more tempting alternative
would be to track down a late-
night showing of the Liza
Minnelli version in a seedy
c i n e m a s o m e w h e r e , Sally
Bowles, after all, would have felt
far more at home there.

MUSIC
Sonerous
Tunes
Anyone acquainted with the
Hawklords album of the late 70's
will have a soft spot for the
creative poetry and sonorous
tunes of Robert Calvert. Those
who make it to this unusual site
for a rock concert could not have
been disappointed. The choice
of venue was probably made
because of the fine acoustics of
the hall, but it did result in
surprised reactions from the
collar and tie staff as they
accepted tickts from a mixture of
hippies, leather clad individuals
and the rare normal looking
person. Incidentally, Calvert fits
into none of these categories
with his white suit and hat and
golden megaphone. Having said
all that, I did notice that they (the
South Bank staff) did seem to
enjoy the mixture of music and
poetry that is a Calvert concert.
Calvert's band were called
'Crankshaft' but infact were
'Maximum Effect' who in turn are
the Turnerless 'Inner City Unit'
who played at Imperial last year.
The first half of the set involved
many renditions from, lucky Leif,
Captain Lockhead, Hype, and
old Calvert-written Hawkwind
numbers. The second half saw a
large section from his latest
album which seems to have a
large p r e o c c u p a t i o n with
embryonic experimentation.
This section was very melodic.
The high point for me was
when they played 'Spirit of the
Age' where they managed better
than at Hawkwind concerts.
Indeed all the Hawkwind
numbers (Psi Power, Damnation
Alley, Flying Doctor, Days of the
Underground, Quark Strange-
ness and Charm) showed how
sorely Hawkwind miss Calvert's
class.
His next concert is at the
Clarendon, Hammersmith on
November 21. To the uninitiatied
I say-Go and see it!

BOOKS
Graham
Greene: Sad,
Nutty,Droll,
Mystified
Getting a degree from St
Ambrose College, Oxford, is a
lot more laid back then the IC
equivalent. Tuition by post-fees
in advance of course, returnable
if you fail (no one has ever been
known to) and degree-diplomas
awarded after three terms study.
This little swindle is slickly
narrated by Graham Green in his
Collected Short Stories—an
omnibus of thirty-seven tales
culled from earlier selections. It
is complimented by the other
bizarre tales: sad, nutty, droll or
mystical. Many of Green's novels
go through a dry and dull patch
in the middle, but with these
s t o r i e s y o u get all the
advantages-the spectacular
imagination, sensitivity and
character sketching-with none
of the disadvantages of his
verbosity. Riches of great delight
meet you and greet you within
these covers-the tale of the
beautiful pekinese that goes fora
night romp in the dustbins with a
length of intestine, or the slightly
strange aeroplane traveller who
said he had a dead baby in his
overnight bag. There are also
more subtle, and slightly sad,
stories, like Two Gentle People,
where the right people, married
to the wrong people, meet fifteen
years too late, or Cheap in
At/gusf-another two lonely
people meeting in a Jamaican
Hotel, both needing friendship.
Green's Catholic faith is
explored in a number of stories
some comic, some serious, like
Special Duties, where Miss
Saunders, formerly head girl of
the Convent of Saint Lati-
tudinaria, Woking, and winner
three years running of the
special prize for piety, tours
churches earning indulgences
for her employer.
At £3.95 this book works out at
about 10p per story; it's
published by Penguin and
available at Waterstones, or you
could boogy on down to the
Penguin Bookshop in Convent
Garden. It's an excellent read for
y o u r s e l f or for a n y o n e ' s
Christmas present.
