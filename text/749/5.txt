On The Edge
Liz Holford takes a look at the Edinburgh Fringe
Edinburgh in August is the ultimate
form of self-indulgence. For a whole
month it is possible to immerse
oneself in every form of theatre,
cinema, dance, mime, opera, music
and art and to forget totally about
the hassles of College. It is easy to
take on a whole new identity;
science students are suddenly
elevated to actors, directors and
light operators and nobody outside
the company is to know that they
are any different. It provides a
unique opportunity for Amateurs
and Professionals to compete on
equal terms, and frequently it is the
amateurs that come out on top.
Imperial College Dramatic
Society members have been basking
in this summer madness for a
number of years now. Each August
ICDS transforms St John's Church
in Princes Street (Edinburghs' main
Street) into Theatre West End. Here
they perform for a few hours a day
under the name Beit Theatre, the
rest of the time they sub-let the
theatre to other groups from all over
the country and also provide these
companies with technical back-up.
Theatre West End is now the largest
student-run venue in Edinburgh and
Festival visitors return to it year
after year, this year it was
recommended in 'The Observer' as
one of the venues with the best
quality and variety of shows.
August 1986 was the most
successful time so far for TWE and
Beit Theatre. Beit's three shows
were; The Woman in White (adapted
from the Wilkie Collins novel by
Nikki Scott). Tony Marchants' The
Lucky Ones (Directed by Gordon
Adgey) and The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner (adapted and directed by
Wanda Jeziorska). The Woman in
White was the greatest commercial
success, whereas The Lucky Ones
met with best critical and audience
responses. They alternated in the
evening slot during weeks 1 and 2 of
the festival. The Mariner played at
lunchtimes during week 3 and had
good reviews and audiences. The
average audience for all 3 shows was
around 80 (TWE has a seating
after a lively evening at the Fringe
club. This is the watering hole for
the performers, the place with the
highest density of egos on earth and
a pretensiousness level hitting sky-
high, but who cares? Everyone is
there to enjoy themselves and,
though few will admit it, to get
'noticed'.
The Festival is a great
opportunity to get familiar with the
works of new writers and directors.
The hit writer this year was
undoubtedly the American Sam
Shepard. There werefiveof his plays
on, and all had an unequalled power
and intensity. It is only a matter of
time before London catches on.
Edinburgh is a surreal experience,
and very hard work! Looking back
it is hard to imagine that I was there,
perhaps this is due to the fact that I
lived on adrenalin, nervous energy
and 'pro-plus' tablets for a month!
It is also unmissable, even if you do
not see yourself as a great theatre
buff! Details of Edinburgh 1987 can
be obtained from current Dramsoc
people, but if you can't wait to get
involved, you can come upto the
Concert Hall on Sat 11th and Sun
12th October to help set up for
performances of The Lucky Ones. If
you do not want to help, do come
along to watch the production on
Wednesday 15th, Friday 17th or
Saturday 18th October at 7.45pm.
For only Â£1.00 you will be able to
catch a glimpse jf August in
Edinburgh at IC in October!

capacity of 120), remarkable for a
festival in which there are over 900
shows being performed and
audience numbers are often in single
figures; one Beit member went to see
a show where he was the entire
audience!
Professionals now see Edinburgh
as a working holiday and a test
ground for new ideas, many of the
best shows are new and
experimental but, financial
disasters. Any play written by the
likes of Dario Fo, Arthur Miller or
Samuel Beckett will sell out however
dire the production. It is interesting
to observe the trends in audiences
that occur by the end of week 1.
Some shows attract the Fringe-
guide waving tourist whereas others
will have audiences consisting of
other performers. Word gets around
quickly about what to see, one of
this years 'in' groups was the
excellent Shadow Syndicate. One of
their shows, Blood of Angels
remained an obscure production for
the weary performers to seek out at
midnight, whereas Between the
Devil and the Deep Blue Sea hit the
commercial big time.
There are shows on for about 16
hours a day in Edinburgh and this
requires a readjustment in the
Fringe-goers internal clock; up at
midday and to bed at 4am (if at all)'
review THE LUCKY ONES
Beit Theatre, the touring company
of Imperial College Dramatic
Society, have been performing at the
Edinburgh Fringe for several years.
Not since What do you say before you
say goodbye? (1983) has the society
presented a show as successful with
the critics as this summer's The
Lucky Ones by Tony Marchant.
This production fully deserved its
favourable reaction from the festival
press. Each member of the cast
handled his or her character
admirably, and it was the
characterisation which made this
play particularly watchable. I was
less convinced that the author had
anything original to say about the
effects of high unemployment on
attitudes on the workplace. The
Lucky Ones was billed as as a
modern piece, but I felt that its
strength was in an intriguing study
of reactions to authority, which did
not seem to particularly dependent
upon the political climate. Where
the production excelled was in the
treatment of the relationship
between the company manager,
Lawrence, and the four clerical
minions. Richard Lester as
Lawrence was a formidable
presence on stage and gave a very
consistent performance. As Dave,
the anti-hero of the play, Simon
Lewis made good use of the most
challenging role and Liz Holford
made the resolute Debbie the most
believable character on stage. Andy
Meeson as Joe and Mike Foulds as
Timothy both convinced in the
more stylised parts.
The Lucky Ones will be
performed for three night next week
in the Union Concert Hall. I
throughly recomend that you go
and see it. The action and dialogue is
frequently funny, and Gordon
Adgey's well paced direction makes
the production lively and absorbing.
