In any film involving a variety of
languages there is always the
problem of how to portray them. It is
possible to use the original language
with subtitles, or to use "accents" or
seemingly not to bother at all.
"Elini" seems to favour the latter and
this becomes rather annoying after a
while.
The action takes place in different
times which are intercut as the story
progresses, one of these is the present
day and the other is the time of the
Greek civil war. Nicholas Cage
(John Malkovich) is a New York
Times Journalist obsessed with
finding out how his mother came to
be executed by the communists
during the Greek civil war.
The film is based on a true story
written by Mr Cage, and has, not
unexpectedly, a very strong bias
against the communists, who are
played as ruthless and heartless.
Although atrocities were perpetrated
by both sides, this film only deals
with the one viewpoint. The idea of
the struggling poor peasant life
becomes a little hard to swallow after
a while. The accents were bad,
everyone, whether Greek,
Hungarian, Czechoslovakian or
American spoke in American. There
is a spoof, well at least a humourous
homage to the great swashbuckling
movies.
Walter Matthau makes a
marvellous Captain Red, who looks
the part exactly, his movement and
gestures are the films' strong point
and he does much to redeem an
otherwise disappointing film. His
accent is of Walt-Disney Cockney
but he is not helped by a weak script.
He gets his teeth into some good
scenes, for example after an
unsuccessful mutiny aboard a
Spanish ship, he is compelled to eat a
boiled rat!
Set adrift in the ocean, Captain
Red and his companion, Frog, are
picked up by a Spanish Galleon
returning from lucrative raids on the
Americas. The ship contains
something to interest both Captain
Red and Frog; a golden throne and a
beautiful girl. The story then tells of
the attempts of Captain Red to
obtain the throne, and Frog the girl.
There are some wonderful set
pieces and delightful cameo roles,
particularly Roy Kinnear
complaining about the bottom
dropping out of the hostage market.
Polanski's direction is straight and
the film lacks the imagination of the
best of his work, but it's a fun film
and one that should not be
completely ignored.
Paul Mayersburg is a screenwriter
of some note, having written both
"The Man Who Fell To Earth" and
"Eureka" for Nic Roeg. His debt to
Roeg is evident from hisfirstattempt
at directing; "Captive". Thefilmhas
a lot of the intrigue and subtlety that
is a scene in which the young
Nicholas is asking his mother
whether their father, who has been in
the States for some time, will be able
to fly over to see him. The child asks
this question in a strong American
accent, the irony ofit detracting from
the film.
However Peter Yates directs the
film in an unfussy and uncluttered
way, controlling both the
development of the characters and
the narrative with skill. The acting is
excellent, particularly Kate Nelligan
and Linda Hunt. John Malkovich's
avenging angel is a little cool at times,
but nevertheless the film has some
very moving moments.
Accents are also a problem in
Polanski's film "Pirates", but it
doesn't really matter because the film
Roeg delights in, and the multi-layer
story. It concerns the kidnapping of a
privileged and sheltered child, Irina
Brook, so that she may be
brainwashed to see the error and
sham of her life.
As a straighforward narrative
film, it is hard to believe, but as an
imaginitive, almost operatic fantasy,
it is the sort of film that is all too
infrequently seen these days. It is a
brave but not altogether successful
attempt that is not helped by some
poor acting by all, except the
excellent Oliver Reed.
Finally, well worth a mention is
the collection of short animated films
at the ICA under the banner of
"Alchemists of the Surreal", worth
seeing it only for the astonishing
"Dimension of Dialogue".
i p i n w n
the Reality of Reaffiliatlon
One of the issues foremost in the
minds of the tiny minority of
Imperial students who give a damn
about the Union, or at least its
policies, is that of whether the
Union should rejoin the NUS.
Ostensibly, the argument is about
membership fees and a say in the
voice of a national body, but the
issue is really about politics. Of
course, membership fees do have an
effect on the debate, but those who
argue that we should stay out
because of these want to stay out for
a deeper un 'erlying reason. This is
rather like the Alliance policy on
proportional representation; they
say that they want it because it is
more democratic, but in reality they
want it less for the democracy and
more for the extra power that it
would give them, and like the Tories
claiming that they don't want
sanctions against South Africa
because they would harm the black
workers, rather than saying that
they would not like to see the white
governemnt fall. This article will try
to explain, in terms of the
underlying motives mentioned
above, why IC Union will never be a
willing member of the NUS.
The NUS is, almost by definition,
a left-wing body. There are two
main reasons for this. Firstly most
students are, by virtue of their
degrees, destined to join the upper
ranks of the establishment as
politicians, businessmen, army
officers and suchlike. Due to
genetics, money and nepotism, their
children will make up the majority
of future students, and thus the
future backbone of the establish-
ment. Therefore, most of today's
students are likely to have
respectable middle class parents-
people who are members of, and
have a vested interest in, the
establishment. For a students'
union to hold the same views as
those prevailing in the establishment
would be for it to lay itself open to
the criticism that it was merely
bleating out the views of its
members' parents like a faithful
sheep, and that it was supporting the
establishment because of its vested
interest. It is human nature for
young adults to demonstrate their
independence from their parents in
a variety of ways, and so the NUS
holds extreme left-wing views in
order to give itself credibility as an
independent, free-thinking body.
This it can afford to do because
neither it, nor its members have
many real responsibilities and have
not had the complexity and
difficulty of real life to disillusion
them.
By becoming scientists, the
students at Imperial have choser to
study the interactions between the
forces of nature, rather than those
between people. Since politics is
about people, the vast majority of
those at Imperial are apathetic
about politics. They don't care, so
long as they're left to do their own
thing. Right-wingers believe in
freedom to do your own thing,
capitalism and minimal government
interference, left-wingers in helping
those less clever/rich/fortunate
than oneself and holding things in
common for the common good.
This makes most people at Imperial
right wing, not by high moral
principle but by coincidence, but
right wing just the same.
Left wingers have a profound
dislike of scientists, and any other
kind of expert, for that matter. (If
you don't believe me read the
Guardian). This is because they are
indispensible and yet more
interested in their field of expertise
than in politics and therefore not
easily susceptible to the control that
has to be exercised in a coi.,mon
ownership socialist environment.
This distrust is well illustrated by the
fact that each unit in the Red Army
has a political commissar who,
before the war, was senior to the
unit commmander; and also the fact
that the Labour Party does not trust
our nuclear scientists to keep our
reactors safe. This distrust and
dislike is reciprocated by the
scientists and the experts. I wonder
how many Red Army commanders
like their political commissars or
how many CEGB scientists will be
voting Labour.
It is thus short-sighted and naive
to believe that an inherently right-
wing scientific group of people such
as Imperial College Union could
have a meaningful and sincere
affiliation with a body so inherently
left wing, unsympathetic and
uninterested in its views as the NUS.
Of course it might become
financially attractive to join, or the
leadership of the Union might
persuade the members to join on the
grounds that everybody else has, but
unless the NUS changes radically, it
will never represent, sympathise or
take an interest in the views of the
members of ICU.
