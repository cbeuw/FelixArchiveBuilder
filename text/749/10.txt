Political Scientists and Independent
Readers amongst you will know that
the Jarrow '86 March will be arriving
in London soon, and to coincide with
this Pinnacle records are releasing
Heads Held High. Side One features
"Powerful Songs" (they say) written
by Alan Hull, from Lindisfarne
("The fog on the Tyne is all mine, all
mine..."), and is backed with trendy
new stuff from the likes of Tom
Robinson, Billy Bragg and Heaven
17 (?). At £4.99 with all profits to the
unemployed, how can you say no?
The latest whisper from the ICA is
that Raymond Briggs, author of
"When The Wind Blows", is
speaking there at the end of the
month. With it, we hear, is a special
showing of the film of the book,
starring such faces as David Bowie
and others. When The Wind Blows,
if you didn't know, is about the life of
a family after the Bomb has sent the
ICA and the rest of us into oblivion.
While we're on the subject of Mr.
Bowie, he has been busy recently
producing the latest album for Iggy
Pop, called, believe it or not, "Blah,
Blah Blah". Quite. For those of you
who keep up with this particular cult,
see him on December 17 at the
Brixton Academy.
Album of the month must be
Everything But The Girl Play Baby
The Stars Shine Bright, but the bad
news is that their concert at the
Albert Hall is full up. D & O's
research indicates that both the PO
Box and the agencies have run out.
Greenwich Village ex-pats, however,
will be able to see Suzanne Vega
instead, at the same place, later on in
the month. I wait and see what words
the music press will use instead of
"folk" this time. Reports of a concert
last year at the LSE make this a must.
Calling all ageing (albanian)
Hippies, The Enid are playing the
shed-like Hammersmith Odeon on
Tuesday. During the bash they'll be
asking the assembled masses to sing
the backing vocals for "Jerusalem".
Yes, the Hymn. AU will be recorded
and free copies will be available for
fans later.
Peering into the future, Elvis
Costello will be at the Royal Albert
Hall (a popular place, it seems) from
22-28 January. Tickets might be left
at the Box Office if you move
sharpish.
Closer to home, the University of
London Union, over by Tottenham
Court Road, are holding their all-
night bash next Friday, 17th. From
eight to.eight you get Sandie Shaw
("Puppet On A String.." but
rumoured to have improved with
age), all-girl Mint Julips, the highly
recommended Joan Collins Fan Club
and lots more. Perhaps for the less
Down & Outs at a tenner, but you
could get a lot worse for a great deal
more; there is a late-late bar and food
is in with the price. Well, I'm going.
Tickets from ULU and perhaps even
the IC Union Office, if ULU get their
act together.
That's it for this week, I'm dashing
off for an evening snack in the Union
Snack Bar; just in case the 'Band'
that were there last Monday
reappear. Down and Far Out!
FILMS A T T H E F R E N C H INSTITUTE
FREE ADMISSION FOR IC S T U D E N T S
As part of the collaboration between the
College's Department of Humanities and the
Institut Francais du Royaume-Uni, IC students
will be admitted free to the film shows held at
the Institut on Monday evenings, on
presentation of their IC Union card. It will also
be possible to see other films either free, or at
a reduced rate.
The Institut Frangais is in Queensberry Place,
behind the French lycee, a few minutes walk
from the IC campus. The programme of films
until the end of this term is now displayed in
the Department of Humanities, 53 Prince's
Gate, or may be obtained from the Institut.
As well as films, students are entitled to free
admission to exhibitions and lectures, and may
attend theatrical or musical events free or at
reduced prices. Generally speaking they will
enjoy the same privileges as members of the
Institut.
