Pimlico
Connection
The Pimlico Connection is a society
set up to help tutor in several inner
London schools. Tutors go to the
schools on Wednesday afternoons
(during the Autumn Term and the
first four weeks of the Spring Term)
to assist the teachers and make
science, engineering and maths
more interesting for the pupils.
We still have a small number of
spare places on the scheme and are
holding a training session for new
tutors this Saturday (11 October) in
EE 606; anybody interested in
joining the scheme is more than
welcome to attend. Alternatively
more information can be obtained
by contacting Keith Bell (Chem Eng
4) or Richard Bleasdale (EE4)
The Royal College of Science
Union has had an excellent
Freshers' Fortnight this year. A
large turnout at the Freshers' UGM
saw Clare McErlane elected as
Duplicating Officer, Duncan
McGregor as Features Editor of
Broadsheet, Nadia ElMasry as
Queen of Jez and Paul, Daren,
Rufus, Helen & Nikos as Ordinary
Members of the Entertainments
Committee.
Ragwise the year has been going
really well so far. What with rag mag
selling at the Freshers' Fair and the
tiddlywinking down Oxford Street
on Saturday, RCSU Rag has now
raised a grand total of Â£1992.88 and
our Theta Totaliser in the Office
window is already half full. (That's
what happens when you have an
exponential scale!) Our top three
collectors were Steve Mercer, Mark
Salisbury and Teresa Sykes.
Congratulations to everybody who
took part.
Alcoholwise our events have also
been well-attended. The Pub Crawl
had to be altered a bit due to the
closure for refurbishment of one of
the pubs and several people
wanting to use their 50p voucher
from the Norfolk in their Freshers'
FELIX. The Barnight saw four yards
being successfully drunk by Pascal
Carr, Richard Johnson, Nick Steele
and David Burns. Boat racing took
place all night with the eventual
winners being 'The Knackered Old
Gits' team.
Entswise there were no legs
broken on the trip out to Queens
Ice Rink last Thursday. 48 people
turned up to prove how similar (or
dissimilar) to Robin Cousins they
were and those who made it back to

THE ACTION BANK
the Union Bar in one piece had the
dubious pleasure of witnessing the
President buying a round!
This Monday we had our first
Freshers' Dinner with the next
three to be held later on in October

you still haven't got your tickets
then you can get them from your
