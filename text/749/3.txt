Dave Colley: 'Bring me the legs of
John Ransom'
The UGM season kicked off to an
acrimonious start on Tuesday.
Billed as the time to "decide your
union's future" it rapidly
degenerated to "decide the colour
of your toilet paper." Villains of
the piece were the notorious
Industrial Society, who had lured
most of the population of IC over
to the Union Dining Hall with
offers of free food and drink and
the proposition: "Do you want to
see my fractionating column, little
boy?" However, this did leave the
opportunity for a lot of self-
congratulation on the part of those
who had made it to the UGM.
Adopting a stance which indicated
his terrible digestive problems,
Chairman Hugh Southey proudly
declared that IndSoc were "a
bunch of bastards."
Meanwhile in the wings, Chris
Martin and Mark Cottle stood
holding microphones, doing their
best to show that they were there
for a purpose — unaware that they
had a couple of duds on their
hands. The circus moved firstly
onto Christine's report: she kept on
declaring with delicacy and
aplomb: "This microphone's really
buggered."
Gareth Fish, expert on the
myriad variations in the art of
calling 'quorum' and exponent of
constitutional niceties that most
people would prefer to forget
about, decided that an interjection
would be quite timely. With the
scope of human experience and
union structure to draw upon, he
came up with: "Do you think it is
right to re-introduce hard toilet
instead of soft paper, in clear
breach of Council policy?"
Christine, however, had done
her homework beforehand and
simply retorted: "Since that
decision was made three years ago,
and has not been brought before
Council since it has now lapsed
under the three year rule."
The three year rule is simply a
piece of legislature that makes sure
union policy is reviewed every once
in a while, to avoid situations
found in English law where it is still
possible to be arrested for spitting
out of a second storey window after
6 o'clock under an edict made in
1643.
It was then pointed out that the
three year rule had also probably
lapsed since that hadn't come up
either last year. Christine replied
that that she was pretty sure it "was
a bye-law anyway" which did
manage to avoid plunging the
meeting into relativistic policy
wrangling over whether a rule
which had lapsed could overrule
another one which had also lapsed
at the same time. Before any
questions about the design of the
soap dispensers could be raised
Christine's report was accepted
and the meeting moved on.
Jackie's report was largely
uneventful, apart from a very
touching handover from Hugh.
Dave Colley started to rant about
clubs who had used dayglo posters
without his permission which then
started an argument between him
and Hugh Stiles about who's
publicity rules were more up-to-
date.
He then proceeded to threaten to
"have John Ranson's legs" for
pretending that Anti-NUS Soc was
a recognised IC society whilst using'
the photocopier in the Union
Office.
Staying with the Hon Sec for the
elections, Adrian Johnson seemed
to be so keen about attending
"boring GUC meetings" that he
became GUC Delegate, whilst an
unsuspecting Mark Cottle was
proposed for Ordinary Member of
House Committee since he
happened to be standing around
holding a microphone at the time.
With that over, the guest
speaker, ULU President Jane
Cannon explained that there really
was student life on the other side of
Hyde Park.
Finally the motions again caused
the most procedural hassle. An
emergency motion was taken first
on whether to fine clubs who
organised events which clashed
with UGMs—three guesses why
this one came up. Although it was
passed in essence, it didn't get
through unscathed. The first
amendment, from Andy Vickers,
was to withdraw the section on
fining clubs who transgressed the
ruling, this was then the subject of
the second amendment as Gren
Manuel tried to put it back in
again. People weren't too keen on
voting back in something that had
just been rei i.oved, and the motion
remained without thefinesclause.
As it became the victim of yet
another procedural motion to
move straight to a vote, Gareth
again piped up to say that there
ought to be a summing up speech
first. Hugh's reply was short, polite
and to the point:
"Bollocks."
Which was followed rapidly by
an apology as he remembered that
there was supposed to be a
summing up speech. With that out
of the way, thefinalmotion was left
to be contested. That hoary old
chestnut, the Barclays Motion once
again resurfaced, and once again
John Ranson called quorum.
Later, in the Union Office Hugh
was heard to utter his favourite
anatomical word as he discovered
that his interpretation was right
after all: which only goes to show
that procedural motions can
seriously damage your credibility.
