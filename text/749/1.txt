Research students in the Computing Department are
being forced to work in cramped conditions because of the
shortage of space in the Huxley Building. A lack of
finance from the University Grants Commission has
meant that there is also a shortage of cupboards, tables,
chairs and computer terminals.
In the past two years the rmmber
of Research Students taken up by
the department annually has risen
from 5 to 23. This has meant that
offices originally intended for five
students are now being occupied by
nine, and some of the students are
having to share offices with
members of staff. A 25% increase in
the number of undergraduate
admissions over the next four years
is likely to cause further congestion
in lecture theatres.
The department hopes that these
problems will be eased by the
completion of a new computing
building which will re-house a
number of offices from Huxley by
1988. As reported in FELIX earlier
this year the building,which has
been financed jointly by the UGC
and the College, will be positioned
next to the Sherfield. It is
anticipated that further space will be
made available by the relocation of
the Holland Club. The use of this
space for lecture theatres is still
under discussion.
A spokesman in computing said
that "about forty to sixty" new
terminals would be bought at the
end of this year, at a cost of two-
thirds of a million pounds, in order
to reduce the current shortage. The
lack of furniture is also being
tackled by a number of
Computings' technical staff who are
busy constructing desks and chairs
inbetween their other duties.
Last Saturday 250 Imperial College
students tiddlywinked down Oxford
Street and Regent Street for Rag. The
event raised about £3,500 in one and
a half hours, which is over £600 more
than last year. The traditional 'Ring-
o-Roses' around Eros was performed
for thefirsttime since the statue was
replaced. The event was described as
a great success and a magnum of
champagne will be presented to the
person who has collected the most
money. Participants are reminded to
return their cans to their CCU office
as soon as possible.

The Natural History and Geological
Museums will introduce compulsory
admission charges from the first of
April. The move follows the Victoria
and Albert Museums' decision to
implement voluntary charges last
November.
Two schemes are currently under
examination. The first involves
charging adults £1.50 and children
75p for entrance, even though this
contradicts the museums policy of
admitting children and students free
ot charge. A second scheme allows
for free admission for children, but a
charge of £2.00 for adults. A
proposal to introduce a passport-
style ticket containing advertisments
and games, in a self-confessed
attempt to camouflage the charges, is
also under consideration.
Mr. Roy Saunders, Secretary of
the Natural History Museum,
explained that the charges were
necessary to make up for the effects
of inflation, and for the development
of new exhibits because the
Government Grant has not kept
pace. "The exhibits in the Geology
Museum arefiftyyears out of date ",
he explained.
A confidential report prepared for
the Museum Trustees estimates that
the number of visitors will drop by
40% as a result of the moves, ihe
report concludes that, unless
measures are taken, the deficit in
museums' funds "will increase to •
,£2.689mby 1990". Raising money by •
sponsorship, staff reductions and
better marketing of museum
publications and facilities are also
suggested in the report.
Representatives from the Civil
Servants' Trades Union and
Imperial's ASTMS union will be
organising a demonstration outside
the museum between 8.30 and 10
a.m. on Thursday 16th, when the
matter is to be discussed by the
Museum Trustees.
