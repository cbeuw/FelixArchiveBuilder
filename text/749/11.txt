Exhibit One
An exhibition entitled Art, Science
and Industry is to be held in the
Sherfield building from the 9th to
the 31st October. Including over a
hundred works in a wide variety of
styles and media, the exhibition has
been arranged to celebrate the
National Industry Year and to
complement the 'Science for
Industry' Exhibition (13-17 October
1986) which is one of the events
marking the 50th Anniversary ofthe
University of London.
Dr Gordon Hargreaves,
responsible for the idea and layout
of the exhibiton, intends it to show
that art can come from the
unexpected sources.
Among the attractions will be
some of the latest developments in
computer graphics and holography,
chocolate sculptures, a set of tables
made from lorry cab parts, and
more conventional scultures and
paintings. Some of the artists
represented are Stehanie Fryer,
Princella Claugh, Leh Tabuer and
Brian Chalkey.
The exhibition is situated in the
Consort Gallery on the ground floor
of the Sherfield Building.

SHERFIELD BUILDING.
MONDAY- OCT. 20th. at 6 pm.
Uncommon Room
A new common room complete with
lockers, easy chairs, and coffee tables
has been provided by the
Department of Computing for the
use of it's 80 MSc students. The
room, which is on level 2 of the
Huxley building, is not available for
undergraduates use, however.
The head of the Computing
Department, Professor Sayers, said
on Wednesday that the new room
was to be used by postgraduates to
"talk and think", although it was
primarily a place to study rather than
to socialise. Another member of the
Department was anxious to point
out that it was not a common room
but rather a "spiritual centre" for
MSc students.
The conversion of the
undergraduate common room for
seminar use last year, following the
Departments' introduction of a new
MSc course, was greeted
unfavourably by students. Professor
Sayers told FELIX however, that a
new undergraduate common room
would be given a high priority
despite the departments' shortage of
space.
Fringe Inventing
Last Monday's Wellsoc lecture,
'Fringe Inventions', was given by
New Scientist contributor and ex-IC
student David Jones.
Mr Jones, aka 'Daedalus', told
the audience of his creations in such
diverse fields as sexual attraction
and the interior hardness of a boiled
egg. He also revealed his frustration
at some ofthe plans which were later
adopted seriously, including a crude
chemical laser, now the backbone of
SDI's anti-missile technology.
Mr Jones gained this post
through the college publications,
The PHOENIX, and has since
worked on 'The Great Egg Race'
and numerous scientific prog-
rammes for ITV and German
Television. He felt that the aim of
his work was to make scientists and
engineers think, which he said was a
very difficult task to achieve.
Exhibit Two
Princess Anne will visit Imperial
College to open the Science for
Industry Exhibition on Monday. The
Exhibition will run from the 13th to
the 18th of this month and will be
attended by 8,000 schoolchildren.
Gill Davies, the Conference Officer
who organised the event, is still
receiving applications but due to lack
of time and space these will have to
ne '•ejected The Exhibition is being
stag;rt in 'he J.C.R., which will mean
that ttie buttery will be closed next
week. The Q.T. fast food outlet will
however, remain open and buttery
seating will be available for
customers use.
New Glider
The Union Finance Committee
decided to purchase a new glider for
the gliding club, at a meeting on
Thursday lunchtime. The glider will
cost £13,000 and will be paid for
with the help of an interest free loan
from the College.
Universities
Overdrawn
British universities are £60m in the
Red, according to a report in
Tuesday's Independent. The
universities have warned the
Secretary of State for Education and
Science, Mr Kenneth Baker, that
they need an extra £250m by 1990 in
order to maintain standards and
prevent bankruptcy. Mr Baker has
proposed an extra £114m for next
year, a move now being considered
by the Treasury. A pay claim of
£160m for university staff is also
under consideration in an attempt to
halt the educational "brain-drain".
Free Speech
The NUS is opposing a proposed
new law which will allow complete
freedom of speech on University
campuses. Severalright-wingM.P.s
have been prevented by angry
protesters from speaking on
controversial issues recently, but the
NUS feels that the new law may
expose certain groups of students to
harassment and violence. They are
anxious to prevent the of recurrence
the intimidation of black, Asian,
Jewish and gay students in
particular.
Open All Hours
The Union Snack Bar will now be
opening regularly in the evenings, in
addition to the normal lunchtime
service. The move was heralded by a
well attended evening of live rock
music on Monday.
Snack Bar Manager, Norman
Jardine, told FELIX that regular
evening entertainment is planned for
the future. Anyone interested in
providing entertaintment should
contact Norman.
