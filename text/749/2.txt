Calling All
Women
Scientists
Dear Female Scientist/Engineer,
Let me introduce myself, my name
is Jane Cannon, and I am the
President of the University of
London Union; I am also an
engineering graduate. I would like to
extend an invitation to you to come
to the first ULU Women Scientists
and Engineers meeting at 6.30 on
Tuesday 14 October at ULU.
The reasons for having such
meetings are two-fold. Firstly they
will serve as a social gathering - some
of you may find that you are the only
female in a class full of males and it
can be difficult to get to know people
under such circumstances, we hope
to put you in touch with many other
people in the same situation.
The second reason for the meeting
is to put together a group of you who
would like to travel around the
country to schools and careers
conventions to encourage more girls
to follow in your footsteps and study
science and engineering.
Please try and come to the meeting
whether you are a first year, a post
graduate, or anywhere in between,
and let me know in advance my
telephone (01-580 9551). Depending
on the numbers, we may be able to
provide some free refreshment!.
Hope to meet you soon,
Jane Cannon,
President, ULU.

Sets The
Record
Straight
Dear Sir,
I have only just caught up with
Mr Neil Sykes' complaint ('Life in a
Northern Town'), in your issue of 3
October. I do not believe that
anyone who was present on the
occasion when I addressed the first
year students, could possibly have
so misunderstood my message. This
was a plea for making the most of
what London has to offer, during
the years of study. I pointed out that
London is the theatre and music
capital of the world, that we are
surrounded by some of the most
celebrated museums in Europe; that
it would be a dreadful shame to
forego all that and then find
oneself—and here the offending
words—in some place remote from
such, quite unique opportunities.
Now I do not read speeches.
There will, as a result, be an
occasional loss of syntax, some
infelicitous phrases which could
readily be banished from a printed
page. I believe this to be price worth
paying, to avoid the deadening
effect of a message read.
Let me assure Mr Sykes that I am
well aware of the fact that neither
industry nor culture stop North of
Watford; that I have laboured in
industry—in factories as well as
laboratories. It is my earnest hope
that the experience of studying at
Imperial College will benefit the
whole country—that, in particular,
many of our graduates will do their
bit to revitalise the regions that are
in greatest need. It would be a crying
shame if all Yorkshiremen were to
get stuck in London.
Yours faithfully,
Eric A Ash
Rector
Hissing at the NUS
A few people have told me that
they thought Tuesday's UGM went
quite well. In that it wasn't bogged
down by numbingly tedious
procedural discussion, and that one
moderately useful motion was
passed, I concede they are right.
This was, however, the first UGM
of the year and the turnout cannot
have been more than ISO; frankly a
pathetic response. The change of
date, and the bloody-mindedness of
Indsoc, may be partly responsible
for this, but few people will be
encouraged to attend again after
Tuesday's showing.
It is naive of me, I am sure, to
expect the highest body in the Union
to take an interest in serious debate
of any issue. It is a symptom of the
famous 'apolitical' stance of ICU at
present. Party political wrangles are
perhaps undesirable, but without the
politically orientated groups at
College I doubt if any serious
discussion would ever occur. For the
most part we are treated, to moronic

arguments over soft toilet paper, and
burdened with a group of mindless
individuals in the back row
practically hissing whenever the
NUS is mentioned. The overall
philosophy seems to be one of
something less than nihilism.
Any student Union has a voice
which it ought to make sure is heard.
I applaud the efforts of ICU Exec to
attract students to meetings, but the
problem is more than timetable
clash. I cannot offer any instant
remedy; it is a question of winning
back the interest of the student body
by treating UGM's with a degree of
reverence.
An Apology
2.00pm Thursday, and it looks as
if this issue may never come out. If it
appears at all, I imagine the
circulation will be severely limited,
as was last week's. I regret we have
been hindered by a series of
frustrating technical problems and I
do not think that the Print Unit will
be running smoothly for another two
weeks. I will go to extreme lengths to
try to ensure that a full issue of
FELIX appears on time but there is
currently little more I can do. I
apologise for providing an inferior
service.
