Holography is the recording of three dimensional information
on two dimensional media. By its nature, it is intriguing to both
artists and scientists. Here Sunny Bains looks at how artists
and scientists work separately and together to further
holography in their different ways, each contributing something
different to what is still only a minority interest. Whether they
work in transmission (light is shone through to view) or
reflection (light reflected off surface to view), use pulse lasers
(for short intense exposures of unstable objects) or the lowliest
Helium-Neon (common red light laser) these people have one
thing in common: they've all been hooked by the hologram.

Considering that holography is
the most comprehensive way of
recording visual information,
you may be surprised to learn
that the art world still considers
it to be a fringe pursuit.
Holograms sell for their novelty
value, not their artistic merit. It
is not difficult to see why this is
the case. If one ventures to look
around the main holographic
galleries (in London, Light
Fantastic at the Trocadero) one
will find lots of bright, clear,
boring holograms with
absolutely nothing to to say.
Less exciting than seaside
shops on a rainy day, these
holograms lack that vital
element which would make
them art: that is, a soul.
All is not lost however. There are,
thankfully, a few holographers who
are genuinely looking to develop
holography's immense artistic
potential. Michael Sowdon is such a
one.
Sowdon has been involved with
holography for more than ten years
now. An artist by training, he is at
present director of Fringe Research
Holographies, Toronto, which he
co-founded in 1974. His work,
which has been exhibited in several
coutries, is both witty and
controversial, so much so in fact
that an anti-establishment work of
his, a reflection holgram entitled Eat
the Rich, was banned when shown
in Britain as part of the Canadian
'No Jesus' - Michael Sowdon
bitterness he obviously feels
towards those who one day might
be responsible for some disaster.
That he can use the medium of
holography to convey such things is
indicative of the fact that
holography needn't remain the sort
of clinical, pure recording method

which it seems to be at present but
can, in the hands of a good artist, be
just as beautiful and disturbing as
many of the traditional art forms.
Holography can simply give to the
artist more degrees of freedom than
he mightformerlyhave been used

Sowdon has very definite views
on the artistic use of holography,
and on the practical problems
related to it. By definition, making a'
hologram is an expensive and very
technical process. For most artists
these two factors make the use of
this medium impossible. By running
an 'artists in residence' scheme;
Fringe Research Holographies
have been able to both train
potential holographers and to equip
them, if only for a relatively short
time. Thus artists are able to learn
the trade before deciding whether
to take the holographic plunge.
Another problem which is slowly
being solved is that of the
restrictions of the technology itself.
At the moment, the lab conditions
required to make hologram are so
rigorous that the work cannot be as
spontaneous as one would like.
With new technological develop-
ments, especially the more frequent
use of pulse lasers in display
holography, the medium may
eventually become as easytouse as
a camera indoors. The develop-
ment of the pulse colour technique
would enhance this further. The
technology exists and ways of using
rit artistically are being developed,
the prohibiting factor is the cost.
For the immediate future,
Michael Sowdon is interested in
using pulse techniques to create
erotic images along the lines of
some of Helmut Newton's
photographic work: the bizarre and
the sexy. He worked with a pulse
laser in Vermont and appreciates
the ability of pulse work to observe *
instantaneous happenings in a more
fundamental way than ever before.
Imagine, for example, a hologram
he worked on which was taken at an
instant when a girl was falling from a
balcony. All the effects of gravity
and wind resistance can be seen in
three dimensions. No doubt a little
imagination could use pulses to
even more surprising effect.
That holography will become a
widely recognised art form is no
doubt. In Canada, Michael Sowdon
is already receiving various Arts
Council and other grants. One day
holography will take its place beside
photography, painting and
sculpture. The only quesition is
when.

Sherfield Exhibition
H o l o g r a p h e r s , M i c h a e l
Wenyon and Susan Gamble are
showing their work at the Art,
Science and Industry exhibit-
ion, on level 2 in the Sherfield
Building. They have come from
opposite ends of the holo-
graphic world together on
some quite beautiful and
artistic holograms.
Wenyon studied physics at
Bristol and then took the Applied
Optics MSc course at IC in 1978,
thus being a classmate of Kaveh
Bazargan. Instead of continuing in
academic life, however, Wenyon
went on to co-found Goldsmiths'
Holography Workshop, through
which artists could be trained in
holographic techniques. Gamble,
who studied fine arts at
Goldsmiths' College, joined the
group in 1980 and subsequently
teamed up with Wenyon.
Their work, which they do jointly
rather than individually, is
extremely vibrant and unusual.
They have managed to take an
unfortunate and unavoidable
holographic side effect —
speckle— and turn it into an asset.
Many of their holograms seem
almost lost under a fog of brightly
coloured blobs of varying sizes
which have a quite mysterious
effect.
Because they work as artists,
rather than manufacturers of
prtirtotote •mtomn

j to sorioifl .y.'isodi
souvenir-type holograms, they find'
they can't attract the kind of
financial backing they feel they
should. Those who are willing to
put money into holography tend to
favour the commercial rather than
the aesthetic. Although they do
find this disheartening, they are in .
no doubt that things will eventually
go their way.
In February a small holographic
art display will be opening at the 1

Victoria and Albert Museum, just
across from the Science Museum
which, has its own permanent,
technical exhibition. Two sides of
Exhibition Road showing the two
sides of the holographic coin.

Major Breakthrough
by Optics Group at IC
I art? to eyaCJ, soiooC! eniyll ,yel¥
! -ennsiiS MisuD .bnuotg'iebtf'.
A major breakthrough in the
field of display holography has
been made by members of the
optics group in the Physics
Department. Dr Kaveh
Bazargan, Dr Michael Damzen,
and William M c G u i g a n
collaborated to bring about the
first natural colour hologram of
a living object using a single
laser.
Kaveh Bazargan has probably
done more work on colour
holography than anybody else in the
holographic community. Not only
has he produced reflection and
transmission colour images by
superimposing monochromatic
holograms, but he has also
developed his own dispersion
compensation technique. The
Bazargan Technique produces
holograms with full parallax and
very low distortion, its only real
disadvantage being that the
holgorams must be seen through a
special viewer which Bazargan
himself designed. The new system,
however, has no such drawbacks.
Unlike any of the old techniques it
can produce colour images of
moving objects and can be viewed
using a white light source.
The new technique makes use of
Stimulated Raman Scattering.
Basically what happens is that a
pulse of green laser light is allowed
slBubivibi
'Lego Men' - Kaveh Bazargan,
Bgzargan Technique
to pass into a pressurised gas cell.
The light which emerges from the
cell consists of three pulses; the
original green, and blue and red
pulses which come from the green
pulse having had its frequency
shifted up and down respectively.
When a suitable holographic plate
or film is exposed simultaneously
using all three colours, three
holograms are reproduced each
exactly matching the other. When
viewed, these holographic images '
'Coal Seam' - Wenyon and Gamble
combine to give a natural colour 3-D
image.
The connection between Raman
scattering and holography was
discovered by accident after a
chance discussion between Kaveh
Bazargan and Mike Damzen, it was
then suggested to Bill McGuigan, a
postgraduate in Applied Optics, as
j o O layoff «rll Hi
an ideal MSc project. The results of
his research are to be published
soort.
At the same time as the research
into colour work was going on at IC,
Ilford were producing holographic
film which was sensitive to red,
green and'blue" light. Previously all
colour work had to be done on two
separate pieces of film; one sensitive
to green and blue light, and the
other sensitive to red. Illford were
contacted and collaborated with
Bazargan to create a natural
colours hologram of a living hand
holding a credit card.
Unfortunately there is at present,
no one responsible for continuing
Dr Kaveh Bazargan
research on this project. Bill
McGuigan was only able to work on
it for the three months allotted to
MSc project work. Damzen has a
demanding job as a lecturer, and
Bazargan is employed at IC to look
into 'holographic elements in optical
computing' in Professer Dainty's
group, rather than to experiment
with display holography. With only
spare time and odds and ends of
equipment being available, work
has virtually ground to a halt.
It is hoped that with a reasonably
large injection of funds (about
£50,000) either in the form of a
SERC or industrial grant, someone
can be taken on to continue where
Bazargan, Damzen and McGuigan
left off, but with new and more
suitable equipment. After that,
progress in developing what
Bazargan calls the Holographic
'dream system' should just be a
matter of time.
