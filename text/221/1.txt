NOTTING HILL AGAIN ACCEPTED
JN HIS DELIVERY at the
Commemoration Day cere-
mony the Rector was to have de-
claimed the Government for a
false sense of values.
Due to indisposition, however, the
text of Sir Patrick Linstead's speech
had to be read last Thursday by the
Pro-Rector, Sir Owen Saunders.
He spoke of the six-month post-
ponement of the starting dates of
" buildings in the public sector " as a
grievous disappointment. Three major
projects and some smaller ones had
been stopped or thrown into doubt.
These were a part of a long-term plan
to provide a balanced technological
education at the highest level. "To
hold up this development was surely
the falsest of economies."
The extent to which IC contributed
to public work was shown by the way
" Whitehall seems to look rather fre-
quently across Westminster from Big
Ben to the Queen's Tower. " This
country had a balance of payments to
meet in human gold reserve too, and
should not allow its stock to become
depleted.
On Friday Felix was unable to ob-
tain any comment from Government
Departments or Labour or Conserva-
tive Party Headquarters. Other Com-

'TWO PEOPLE were elected unopposed to the Ents. Commiittee,
a change in the Constitution was passed (" This is serious" said
Molam), and this year's Carnival Charity was chosen, at the first
Union meeting of the Session.
The meeting opened, late as usual,
and after the regular business was
summarily disposed of, Dr. Weale
gave the financial report for the last
year, and was given a vote of thanks.

How The Voting
Went
JN THE PAPER ballot following
the IC Union Meeting on
Thursday week a tie arose for
elimination between the Notling
Hill Housing Trust and the Im-
perial Cancer Research Fund.
The second was eliminated by use
of the second choices of those in
favour of the Family Planning Inter-
national Campaign, after three re-
counts.
The voting figures were :—
FP1C 142
NHHT 126
ICRF 126
On the second ballot in which the
votes for Cancer Research were re-
distributed, Notting Hill drew ahead
by 204 votes to 181 in favour
Family Planning.

If this last motion is passed once
more with a two thirds majority, those
six members of the Council which
previously have been constituent Col-
lege representatives, need no longer
b; equally distributed between the
Colleges.
The rest of the time was devoted
to a virulent debate on the selection of
the Carnival Charity.
Ken West gave a passionate rehear-
sal of the evils which the Notting-
Hill Housing Trust seeks to remedy,
and David Reich gave a very compe-
tent delivery of h/s perennial speech in
favour of the Imperial Cancer Re-
search Fund. The most novel charity
was the Family Planning International
Campaign, proposed by Graham
Thompson, Chairman of the Huxley
Society.
The speeches from the floor brought
up the obvious bogey-man—the feel-
ings of the Catholics, inside and out-
side the College, on the question of
family planning. In fact we heard
more about the vices and virtues of
FPIC, than of either other charity.
The most moving speech, from a
Roman Catholic housewife who
practices Family Planning, received
much applause, from the floor.
Chris Hocking, representing the
Carnival Committee, spared us the
usual platitudes about all pulling to-
gether whatever the charity—he told
us to choose Cancer Research.
He was disappointed—the show of
hands was indecisive, and under the
system of balloting employed, the
charity chosen was the Notting Hill
Housing Trust.
