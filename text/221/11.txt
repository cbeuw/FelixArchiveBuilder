Rugby Report by Pete Ray
BLACKHEATH
TOO STRONG
THE FIRST DEFEAT of the season for the Rugby team came
at the hand of a strong, experienced Blackheath side by 19 pts. to 6.
This score greatly exaggerated the difference between the two sides.
The college started strongly and missed the opportunity to gain a 6 point
lead by being unable to land two early, close range penalties.
Blackheath came back and scoicU
6 quick points through a penalty and
a try before .Mills kicked a straight
forward penalty goal for the College.
They were then allowed to gain the
initiative, mainly through a series of
elementary mistakes by the I.C. back
division.
After half time however, the col-
lege side began to show some of the
fire which may make them a strong
force this season. The game was now
running very much I.C.'s way when
after a splendid movement across the
backs the pass to Ridley, who looked
certain to score as all he had to do was
eaten the ball and fall down, was inter-
cepted by the opposing winger who
ran the length of the field to score
under the posts. The try was con-
verted and while I.C. were rvcking on
their heels, the Club added another 5
points through a try from a tap
penalty. The college came back and
Riley scored what was probably the
best try of the match after good hand-
ling by his backs. The conversion
flailed and shortly before the enol
Blackheath scored another good try
to end a game which was enjoyed by
both plavers and spectators.
A N A S T R O N O M I C A L score was amassed by the 1st X V against the
Metropolitan Police " G " div.—63 points to 5. With the forwards com-
bining together well and completely swamping the opposition, there was
plenty of chance for the three-quarters at last to show their ability. Leading
the try scorers were Jenkins with 4 and Riley with 3.

I.C. 6—K.C 1
A BRAVE START in the Cup
competitions this year by the
soccer club. Both the 2nds and
4ths won in the Reserves' Cup,
while the 6th had a technical win
in the Minor Cup.
The 2nd XI met King's 3rds and
soon showed their superiority when
Conway scored after 5 minutes.
Pressure was kept on the King's goal
but no more goals resulted. Then,
with the I.C. defence waiting for what
seemed an obvious off-side decision.
King's equalised. The standard was
slowly being brought down but it was
a very inspiring piece of football
which regained the lead for I.C. More-
land received the ball in his own half
and squared the ball to Grundy who
pushed the ball forward to Cooper.
He, in turn, put a good through ball
to Smart who slid it past the goal-
keeper very easily. Several minutes
later Bentham after a long tricky run
lost the ball 2 yards from the goal but
in a goalmouth misunderstanding the
King's defenders put the ball i n the
net. The I.C. superior play was
evident again when Bentham lobbed a
good goal from outside the penalty
box. Wellfair then put White through
who scored from 8 yds. Bentham
finally capped the match by dribbling
the ball round the goalkeeper for the
6th.
In the next round the 2nds meet the
3rds and then the 4ths if they win this
match.

ATHLETICS
N E X T S A T U R D A Y SEES the first
match in the new winter Athletics
league, providing an excellent
chance of some winter competition
and a useful lead-in to the Field events
and Relay Cup later in the month.
The meeting is in the morning and
so there is plenty of chance for any
of you burly Rugger or Soccer men
to help out and still play in the after-
noon.
LAST OCTOBER Volleyball be-
came, for the first time, an Olympic
sport—a true reflection of its fast-in-
creasing popularity. In spite of this
and the fact that I.C. has had a volley-
ball club for over a year not many
students have little idea what I
I • sport
involves.
Played in a court about half the
size of a tennis court, the aim is to
get a football-sized ball onto the
ground on your opponents side of
the court. Across the middle of the
court is an 8 ft. high net which the
ball must go over though any number
of players can handle it before it
crosses the net. The ball has to be hit
by hand and the main tactics involve
passing the ball from one to another
until a high lob near the net can be
smashed into the enemy's court.
Started by Persian student Hadi
Gharai the I.C. club now has over 20
regular members and plays in the
Amateur Volleyball Association, " B "
league though all their matches have
to be " aways " as we have no suitable
courts. Attempts to book the U . L . U .
gym have failed and offers to repre-
sent U.L. turned down even though
the.c is no U.I.. team.
