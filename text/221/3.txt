CHRISTIANITY IN INDUSTRY
" T H E CHURCH is an introverted organisation only concerned
with the faithful few." This opinion was disputed in a recent
weekend course at Luton Industrial College.
Seven I.C. men attended the course
whose theme was " Industry." The
eleven lectures in the course ranged
understanding " to " Shop Stewards."
Besides giving a background know-
ledge of industry1
, the course also
showed how the Methodists are
getting to grips with society in all its
problems. The College is centred at
the Industrial Mission which com-
bines community centre, College and
Church, providing a good example of
the Church involving itself in the
problems of an industrial town.
Other problems dealt with were
those of management, trade unions,
economy control and general ones of
industrial relations. The Warden of
the College, the Rev. Bill Gowland
also gave lectures on contemporary
society and the r61e of industrial
chaplains.
There is another course for Uni-
versity Students, from the 4th-6th
February for anyone interested.

RISING DAMP
THE THROWING of water is to
be banned at future A.G.M.'s of
Northampton College Union. After
the last A.G.M. floor tiles were found
to have swollen, causing the floor to
rise by two inches.

LYCEUM NOT FOR U.C,
U.C. UNION entertainments com-
mittee has had to turn down an offer
by the Lyceum in the Strand of a free
ballroom, because of the impossibility
of" booking a star attraction, and the
likelihood of not fulfilling the only
condition, the sale of more than 800
tickets.

NO LABOUR ORGANISATION?
LONDON School of Economics
may soon be without an official La-
bour Party Organisation. The Chair-
man has resigned in order to join the
newly formed Socialist Society, claim-
ing that the Labour Society is turning
into " A receptacle for Transport
House Twits." Many other committee
members haye also resigned.

SO THIS IS DEMOCRACY?
STUDENTS in Rhodesia now have
to sign a pledge to abstain frc|m
politics before they can receive a state
grant. They have to promise not
to join any political organisation, not
to take part in any canvassing and
not to display any placards.
STOLEN BEER
NORTHERN Polytechnic have now
had five crates of beer stolen from
the Union during dances since the
beginning of term. No official action
has yet been taken.

PAIGNTON BEAVEK
A MOTION proposing the adop-
tion of a beaver from Paignton Zoo,
as a living representation of their
Mascot " Beaver" was defeated at
a meeting of London School of Eco-
nomics Union. It was suggested that
the five guineas annual expenditure
entailed would have been a " frivolous
waste of money."

DANGERS OF SCIENCE
by GARTH SIMPSON
^ S SCIENTISTS and technologists we were warned of the dangers
of the scientific approach of " accurate and dispassionate obser-
vation " to more intangible human problems.
For example, how could this type
of approach do anything but prove all
men were not alike and perhaps even
unequal? The Cold War was cited
as another example of man's inability
to observe his fellow men with insight
gained from knowledge of himself.
Mr. E. F. Schumacher, Economic
Advisor and Director of Statistics of
the National Coal Board, was speak-
ing in the second of a series of Gene-
ral Studies lectures on Tuesday, 26th,
Mr. Schumacher began by classsi-
fying observation and understanding
into four distinct fields:—man's un-
derstanding of himself, man's external
observation of other people and the
world about him, man's understanding
of other people's minds, and man as
observed by other people. He attribu-
ted the wars and .misunderstandings
of the latter centuries to man's inabilty
to develop these four facets equally.
During question time Mr. Schuma-
cher was quick to point out that
Freud's theories, based only on
clinical observations of his fellow
kind, were, in his opinion, rather
limited. He even suggested that in
the not too distant future students of
psychology would not regard his con-
tribution as very significant.
Furthermore, Freud's concept of the
" Inner Mystique of Man" was by
no means original, in fact all the
ancient religions had accepted the
existence of an intangible part of a
man's character in the old adage
" Know Thyself." Freudians take
note ! !
TENORS W A N T E D
By Chris Evans
pOLLOWING ITS HIGHLY successful tour, the Gilbert and
Sullivan Society's production of " The Mikado " returns to Col-
lege for four nights on November 9th-12th.
This first tour attempted by the
Society, proved a near overwhelming
problem in organisation. A cast and
orchestra of fifty stayed in caravans
at Folkestone for a week to do five
shows.
Response to the production was
both enthusiastic and appreciative, the
last two nights being really full houses.
The cast was strong throughout and
glaring weaknesses usually found in
college productions were missing.
After the show, new records for
removing make-up and getting to the
pub were set up. The Mayor thanked
us by letter, expressing the apprecia-
tion of many of the residents.
In spite of excellent accounts in the
West Country press, audiences were
poor in Bristol, but the choice of
venue was open to criticism. Never-
theless, it was a highly enjoyable tour
and we hope to visit Folkestone again
next summer.
New members, particularly basses
and tenors, are always welcome,
ladies are usually in the majority.
Future plans after " The Mikado"
include " H.M.S. Pinafore" and
" Trial by Jury " next term. Rehear-
sals will take place on Thursdays at
7.30 in the Concert Hall. Come along,
or contact J. R. Ault, Room 57, New
Beit Hall.
MODEL AIRCRAFT
RALLY
SUNDAY, OCTOBER 17th, saw
the end of the model aircraft fly-
ing season for this year, when
I.C.M.A.C. sponsored the last big
control line rally.
The meeting was well supported,
there being a large number of entries
from clubs in the London area, and
from as far afield as Coventry and
Luton.
Two events were held—"combat"
(a sort of miniature dog-fight) and
" rat-race " (for the speed fiends).
The final of the rat racing compe-
tition, run over 10 miles, was won at
an average speed of 110 m.p.h. be-
tween pit-stops !
Two members of the British team
at the European championships at
Brussels this year, entered the com-
bat event, and despite fast failing light
the finalists put up a very fine show.

STUDENT WELFARE
OFFICER
Barry Mair—has started contacting
some local " digs" with a view to
helping students looking for some-
where to live. He will put a list of
vacancies up regularly on the notice
board in the Union Office. People
wishing to advertise spare places in
flats, etc. may also pin up notices free
of charge in the same place. In future
no notices of this type will be dis-
played in the Union Buildings.
Union on
a Shoestring
1,400 OF THE £5,000 set aside for
...the new Sports Centre has already
been spent by the Union and if seems
likely that a further £1,700 will be lost
in a similar way this year.
It is unlikely that the money allo-
cated will last longer than next year.
By this time it is hoped to have
reached agreement with the College
authorities for more income.
It is dubious whether the College
fees which include Union fees—can
be raised for some time to come and
consequently increased income cannot
be expected from this source.
BARBER-BEAUMONT
RETURNED
THE BUST OF BarbeP-Beaumont
which was taken by certain men of
R.C.S. in lieu of a Q.M.C. trophy was
returned on the 26th after threats of
" Return our bust by 4.30 or we shall
inform the police."
The mistake was made when stu-
dents at QJM.C. were seen to be
bowing to the bust, and it was assumed
it was something of importance.
Har Johns
THE MASCOT OF the Battersea
Teachers' Training College—whose
loss last fortnight was attributed to
I.C. Students—is in fact believed to
have been stolen by members of St.
Mark's and St. John's College, Chel-
sea.
RICHARD II.
TWELVE MEMBERS of Dramsoc
went to see " Richard II" at the
Nottingham Playhouse. This Theatre
has a circular auditorium and was
designed to look good at the expense
of functioning well.
The play itself was marred by un-
balanced casting; John Neville's very
sensitive performance being offset by
inexperienced actors who found
Shakespeare's poetry too restricting.
GUINNESS
SENSATION
SUPER-COOLED Guinness is now
on sale in the Union Bar at 4d. a
pint less than it cost last term, when
there was a fault in the cooling system.
