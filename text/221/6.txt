In this second feature we have attempted to show something of
the life of students in hall. Next we will follow up with some statis-
tics on the living conditions and activities of IC students. These
figures are now being gathered by Kanta Polls.

daily, and the linen changed weekly.
Paul finds the laundry tends to be
overcrowded, but there is supposed to
be a booking system. He spends
£3 a week on food.
Visitors are allowed at any time of
the day, but are expected to leave by
a reasonable hour in the evening. The
definition of " reasonable" is the
responsibility of the student, as long
as it agrees with the authorities' defi-
nition.
The kitchen on the Gallery Floor
is too small for any selfj-respecting
chef, but a small number of kettles is
provided, and the rooms are fitted
with 13 amp. power points so that
coffee can be brewed in rooms.
Tizard Tall has the use of South-
side's Union amenities—bar, lounge,
T.V. etc. Every Tuesday and Thurs-
day evenings the residents meet for a
chat over coffee, called the Buttery
Hour. Internal and external 'phones
are provided on the Gallery floor, with
a separate system from there to the
landings.
There are regulations concerning
the sticking of pictures on walls, to
which Paul is willing to conform, but
he is unable to accept responsibility
for the activities of his grape-vine !
The greatest advantage of living in
hall, he considers, is the negligible
travel times to and from the College.

shares his room with a dentist
and a specialist in ladies' under-
wear. The Home for Young Em-
ployees of Limited Means is a
private hostel in Hampstead.

" HTHE S T A N D A R D OF com-
fort and amenities here is
better than in any other hall I
know," says Paul, a postgraduate
Plant Pathologist, who has a
stereotyped room on the eighth
floor of Tizard Hall. He added
however, that there are serious
defects in design—he helped to
build the place !—and the stair-
case system does not really work.
He pays £2 10s. Od. a week for a
well-furnished, centrally-heated room,
with a good view. One landing—eifht
people—boasts one bath, one shower,,
and two lavatories. There are free
laundry facilities, the room is cleaned

young city workers, some of whom
are studying part time in different col-
leges. There are only four university
students in the hostel which is run
more like the boarding house of a
school than the other halls which we
visited.
The residents have to make and
serve supper on a rota system and it
was David's turn when we visited him.
This job although not too difficult has
to be done under the eyes of a watch-
ful " prefect."
With film societies, photographic
clubs the hostel tries to be self con-
tained. There are certificates telling
how HYELM has won numerous
dahlia-growing contests which are dis-
played in a case in the hall.
The hostel was set un in 1928 as
a limited company and is non-profit-
making. It is now administered by a
warden-secretary who is responsible
for admissions. It is a difficult place
to get into as most residents are re-
commended on a friend of a friend
basis and good character references
have to be supplied.
Once in, though, the physical con-
ditions are reasonable. Good library
facilities and games rooms are pro-
vided, and there is a rugby club for
the less sedentary. .Meals are provided,
with the exception of weekday
lunches, and the only extra that
David has to pay for is heating i n
his room—sixpence in the slot for a
gas fire.
For someone accustomed to life
in one of the college halls some of the
restrictions would appear irksome.
Visitors out by eleven. N o girls up
to your room. N o key to the front
door. If David returns late then he
has to throw stones at trie windows
of other residents until someone comes
and lets him in.
Handicap

with women's accommoda-
tion in other universities, I think
how lucky we are." Susan is a
2nd year Icwarian who has had
the same room in hall for both
her years in college.
She was especially fortunate to gzt
into hall last year as she was the first
fresher woman to be alloted a place.
She admits to not being a great social
mixer but by being in Beit she has
taken more part in University life
than she had previously anticipated.
She is now on the R.C.S. union council
and is S.C.C. secretary.
" I'm really pleased with everything
here—it couldn't be better." Susan's
room is slightly larger than standard
and being on the 4th floor annex
affords her more privacy and quiet
than the other girls on the 3rd floor.
As in all the I.C. halls her room is
serviced daily and she has full laundry
facilities. The cooking facilities are
less adequate—the 23 girls in Beit
share 6 gas rings. This means that
they cannot execute their prowess in
the kitchen to its greatest advantage.
They are further handicapped in the
culinary field by having no refrige-
rators.
We asked Susan whether it worried
her to share a hall with men. She
replied, " I never think about it."
" N o overnight visitors—rarely a
handicap."
Her only complaint was that the
Prince Consort Road Traffic was very
disturbing, especially in the mornings.
