Guilds* Last night, Monday, R.C.S, President Hike Scott had to t e l l him
were the spanner was, since he had f a i l e d to solve the l a s t clue. Some-
one suspected that i t would be presented to Dai at the G u i l d s dinner, but
i t i s rumoured that Ken West , the v i c e president of R.C.S., was a f r a i d
for h i s l i f e and trousers i f i t was not returned f o r Morphy Day, (How-

JOLLY GOOD FELLOWS?.
Why do c e r t a i n members of the Rugby Club have to enjoy themselves at
the expense of others? One may be able to condone t h e i r drunken orgies,
but when they invade en masse—- thh F o l k Song Club and p e r s i s t e n t l y
heckle from the back, t h i s is a f a r more serious matter. Three of t h e i r
"crowd" c o n t i n u a l l y annoyed the audience u n t i l f i n a l l y about a dozen
threatened t o throw them out. T h i s warning was unheeded, but seeing that
they could derive no more pleasure or amusement, they disbanded.
BLACK DEATH IN GHITE PARISH.
P a t r i c Dickenson, the poet and broadcaster, r e c e n t l y suggested that
poets do not g e n e r a l l y expect to be taken s e r i o u s l y p a r t i c u l a r l y
when being funny.
Serious opinions can be s u c c e s s f u l l y communicated i n a funny idiom.
In example he quoted the death of a research s c i e n t i s t from. B l a c k Death
at a germ warfare establishment i n White p a r i s h , W i l t s h i r e ; he thought that
t h i s was a most s i g n i f i c a n t event,
Mr. Dickenson was d i s c u s s i n g w i t h eleven members of the L i t e r a r y
Society l a s t Ytr
ednesday what they expected to get out of l i t e r a t u r e ,
"What does a poet w r i t e f o r ? " In r e p l y he suggested that the poet wrote
f o r no p a r t i c u l a r reason, other than to communicate w i t h anyone who i s
w i l l i n g to understand. The meaning extracted from the poem depends to
some extent on what the reader expects t o o b t a i n .
