Interviewed by Dick Waterman
\ A / H A T IS the purpose of the Carnival as a whole and in particular
Rag Week ?
Obviously, the Carnival is organised solely to raise as much
money for our chosen charity as possible. We have decided to experi-
ment by having a Rag Week this
year as it was found that only
£170 (apart from the procession)
was collected outside I.C. last
year.
We believe that Rag Week will
raise a far greater amount, and will
also relieve some of the pressure on
the Carnival organisers and helpers
(luring Carnival week as we shall not
pj collecting outside college during
Carnival week.
What events will be taking place
during Rag Week?
Rag Week will mainly consist of
collections outside L C , as too many
organised events in College would, i n
part, defeat its purpose. There will
be, however, two hops, one on the
first day of Rag Week, 6th Nov., and
the other on 13th Nov.
Stunts organised by the Carnival
Commandos will fill most of the
week's timetable: two of the ideas
already suggested are—putting a large
banner round the G.P.O. tower and
the invasion of the stage of a West
End Theatre by students carrying ban-
ners.
Is help needed by yo.:r Committee
to run any of the event:, in Rag Week
and if so, who should st_Jents wishing
to assist contact ?
We do need a great deal of help.
This year's Carnival Committee is
comprised mainly of students new to
this type of work, and we still need a
few more committee members. Also,
assistance is needed to suggest ideas
for the stunts and to carry them out.
If anyone is interested they should
contact Roger Cook, Commando
Leader, 17, Old Beit or Barry Boddy.

How much money do you expect to
raise, and what expenses will be in-
curred?
The target for the Carnival is £3000,
£700 of which it is hoped will come
from Rag Week. The expenses for
Rag Week will be very small indeed,
another good argument for its addi-
tion to I.C.'s activities.
Do you realise that at the I.C.
Union Meeting you antagonised the
majority of those present by your
destructive comments on the charities
proposed?
I did not realise at the time that I
annoyed the people at the meeting,
but I do not think I made destructive
comments about the charities. A l l I
expressed was the view of the Carni-
val Committee, but now that a charity
has been chosen the Committee will,
nevertheless, be putting i n a tremen-
dous amount of work to ensure that
the Carnival will be at least as great
a success as last year's.
When I said that part of the Com-
The Carnival Chairman, right,
answering questions last Wednes-
day night.
mittee would resign if F.P.I.C. was
chosen, I did mean only part of the
Committee. I do not wish the charity
to suffer through my misunderstood
statements at the meeting.
AACHEN THANKS
Y}EAR FELLOWS,
After our splendid visit to Lon-
don we all have reached Aachen
again in good health and still better
mood, in remembrance to your so
very kind way of looking after us
and what was good for us.
At this place we want to express
once again our feelings of great grace
for all of you, who had such an
active part in doing all things we en-
joyed so much.
Thank you very, very much !

PROPAGANDA ?
\\JHILE READING the papers
in the I.C. lounge today, I
came across several copies of a
Pakistan morning paper, "Dawn,"
which had obviously been placed
there on purpose. A large ma-
jority of like items in the paper
were concerned with the " Indian
aggression on Pakistan."
Placed at several other strategic
points in the lounge were Pakistan
Government publications, such as
" India's War on Pakistan," etc. The
content of these is not difficult to
guess. Whatever one's views on the
political situation in the Indian sub-
continent, such action is to be de-
plored. The point is not that, to say
the least, these publications gave a
very one-sided account of the situa-
tion, but that the Union Lounge is
not the place for the dissemination of
propaganda.
Tnose concerned are entirely at
liberty to make their point of view
known by holding a public meeting.
Since it is easy to guess who are the
authors of this action, it is hoped that
Union officials will take steps to pre-
vent the recurrence of such happen-
ings.
