remedied by the simple purchase of

INTERNATIONAL HALL
where Colin lives is one of the
halls operated by the University
of London. In many ways these
halls are similar to the Imperial
College halls but are slightly less
easy on regulations.
Visitors must be signed in and out,
and leave by eleven. Colin suggested
that this rule is difficult but not im-
possible to avoid.
The hostel can boast a bar which,
in common with other university h Us
regularly makes a loss. Its other fa-
cilities include a television room and
book and record libraries.
Unfortunately meals are paid for
in the rent of £6 a week. This means
that when Colin eats at IC in order to
spend an evening at college he is, in
effect, paying for his meal twice.
"Anyway the food at International
Hall is below Mooney standards."
Cooking facilities are meagre with
only one kettle and electric ring for a.
whole landing. The room is fairly
small (8 ft. x 14 ft.) and there is no
washbasin but these are not the main
problems—•
" The big disadvantage of this place
is the Nurses* Hostel opposite, they
tend to be intolerant of eccentricities
in students."
International Hall is about half an
hour away from college by tube or
else it takes one hour to walk the dis-
tance from Russell Square.
Colin prefers to walk.
