Jeremy Taylor says
" A g Pleez Daddy"
" APARTHEID is wrong. The theory of it is to divide up the land
Tietween the races—segregation of people is a secondary effect.
It has not fully been put into practice in South Africa because a com-
plete division of the country would be economically disastrous.
POOR
MONEY
M E A R L Y TWO hundred im-
maculately-attired couples
found their way to the seven-
teenth IC Commemoration Ball
last Thursday.
The new venue—Grosvenor Ball-
room—was a <
l
i appointment (and
five shillings dearer) in comparison
with Claridges'. The band was medi-
ocre and the drinks extortionate—
beer 6/- a pint, three sherries 18/-,
table wines about £2 per bottle.
High prices must be expected in
Park Lane, but can students really
afford four pounds five shillings for a
double ticket, and hiring or buying a
dinner suit, dress-shirt and cummer-
band—not to mention the extrava-
gant extremes to which the girls must
go ? Further, is it fair to charge 25/-
for two photos, or to expect " . . .
don't forget the tip for the waiter,
sir"?
Entertainments committees must
take a long look into such necessary
social events that are a " cut above "
the general run. Already the RCS Sil-
wood Ball is under review because of
its huge loss.
New hotels are continually spring-
ing up, and are eager to create an
image and traditions. O n our own
doorstep there is the Royal Garden
Hotel j perhaps they would welcome
our Commemoration Ball.
One way or another IC must ensure
that those faithful students who sup-
port these expensive functions will ob-
ialn value for money.
CHEMISTRY
DISAPPOINTS
T N S O M E R E S P E C T S the exhibition
' i n the Chemistry Department was
disappointing. However, the fact
that some attempt at an exhibition had
been arranged made it better than
many Deraptmer.t;.
The exhibition was divided into
many different sections in different
parts of the building. In many of the
sections however, all that could be
seen was a massive electrical console
with a solitary person in charge to
answer questions.
There was an attractive disply i l -
lustrating radio-tracer technique in
plant-life in the entrance hall. But
for sheer enthusiasm the section con-
cerned with organic techniques was
unsurpassed, the demonstrators al-
most rivalling with each other to dis-
play their work.
One member of staff observed that
the exhibitipn would probably attract
more people if held in the morning
rather than the evening and indeed,
there did not seem to be many people
there.

SELLS ITSELF
IT'S N I C E T O see disinterested
scientists descend from their Par-
nassian luights now and then, to actu-
ally sell themselves. In Physics on
Thursday and Friday, one could find
examples of both the hard-sell and the
soft-sell.
The soft-sell was Dr. Latham spell-
ing for the Plasma section's pride and
joy, the Polytron a device, which is
trying to bottle plasmas for the per-
iods necessary for thermo-nuclear
power production. His rumpled ap;
pearance and talk of hoaxing
D.S.I.R. for grants, and of baffling
problems in a region where theories
do not apply, made one think that the
spirit of the Rutherford-type ama-
teur is not entirely dead in the days
of the Big Machine.
Dr. Lerner's little pep-talk to 3rd
year undergraduates made going into
Spectroscopy look like joining the
Modern Army, in two ways : —
1. Can you gain the respect of
those men? (Because spectroscopists
are individuals, who have to pull
their weight—not like those organ-
isation men on other levels).
2. Join Spectroscopy and see the
World (" There aren't many air-
fields in '.'i; world," he said, "Where
I can't ret a beer from someone I
know ").
BOTANY
GOES ALL OUT
IN THE BEIT Quadrangle it was in-
-Meresting to compare the Botany and
Zoology Department exhibitions. The
former had apparently been in prepara-
tion for some three weeks before-
hand, though, as with Zoology, had
actually been set up only that morn-
ing.
Altogether Botany had 57 exhibits
in sixteen rooms. One of the most
popular of these was the genetics, as
applied particularly to humans (who
said Botany was all plants ?) and
especially to those with abnormal
chromosomes and rarely seen outside
mental institutions. Its success could
be measured by the fact that the lec-
turer was unable to enter his own
room.
Apart from such general informa-
tion as on the common diseases of
potatoes and a display of fungi, there
were some meaty five-minute lec-
turettes like the one on how plant
chloroplasts make sugar and the ways
in which this is verified experimen-
tally,
Impressive new equipment and col-
oured lights added to the Earls Court
atm6sphere. In contrast Zoology had
but one laboratory on show—on the
third floor (no lift).
T H E M A T H S Exhibition was con-
spicuous by its absence.
LORD FLOREY'S
SPEECH
AFTER AN AMUSING opening
•<*Lord Florey settled into a serious
vein and talked about the problems
facing science and technology.
The growth of technology, he said,
was needed for the improvement of
Britain, but less young people seemed
willing to take up science. As well as
this problem, Lord Florey stressed the
necessity of good management :
" social psychology " being as impor-
tant as many scientific discoveries.
Lord Florey ended by saying that
although England could not compete
in, say, the U.S. space programme, she
should develop a special field of work
and lead the world in this. A l l young
scientists must realise the conse-
quences of their work
Hockey Club's
Saturday Win
I.C. 1st 1
—Epsom 1st 0
. . . C P S O M H O C K E Y Club were keen
t-to avenge their 2
—
1 defeat by
I.C. last season in this well balanced
match. Epsom's forwards were in-
itially more workmanlike than those
of I.C. but the defence held its own
promisingly.
After the interval the continued
pressure of the attack and the abrupt
ending of any Epsom onslaught soon
resulted in I.C. gaining the psycho-
logical advantage and five minutes
from time Hough clipped a pass from
Clark through the keeper's legs to
clinch the defeat.
WORKING HOLIDAYS
T H E E X P L O R A T I O N Society is
branching out. It now hopes to be
able to assist people with working
holidays. Visiting Arctic Norway
for £10 was one of the possibilities
discussed at their meeting last week.
the Government belong to this organ
isation, which, incidentally, still works
underground.
" In Rhodesia there is a more com-
plex situation. The people have
never been integrated, and probably
never will be. I can't see that Rho-
desia as we know it will survive. The
whites will have to get out sooner or
later. Yes, the British Government is
dead right i n its dealings with Ian
Smith."
Jeremy Taylor, of " Wait a Minim "
fame, was airing his views during the
interval at I C Folk Song Club's Hoot-
enanny on Wednesday night. He
speaks with some authority, having
lived in South Africa for five years.
During the evening he sang songs
from the show, and played on a harp
from Central Africa, much to the do-
light of the audience.
Derek Hall and the Wayfarers also
appeared, as per usual, and the com-
pany was " graced " by the appear-
ance of certain rowdy Soccer and
Rugby Club elements at about ten
o'clock. These " gentlemen " were
promptly sat on, and were obliged to
leave.
