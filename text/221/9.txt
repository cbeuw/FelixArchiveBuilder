PROFILE
Warden's
Wife
\j\RS. B U T L E R was born in
' S o u t h Africa. She came to
England after taking a B.A. in
English and Psychology, and
within a week of her arrival here
met Dr. Butler.
She and Iter husband now live in
Southside, which she describes as " a
crazy piece of architecture," and are
responsible for the 72 students of
Keogh Hall. She says modestly that
it does not take up much time fulfil-
ling these responsibilities.
Asked about South Africa she re-
plied, •' I think I couldn't live there
now because I feel s
o strongly that the
negroes there are getting a very rough
deal."
She was emphatic i n stating her be-
lief that it is the duty o
f the white
man to educate the netjro, and admits
that, at the present time, it would be
a bad thing to let the uneducated ne-
groes o
f South Africa have the vote.
The Ih.'nks Great Britain should make
Rhodesia accspt the constitution, yet
undertake to finance a huge attack
on poor education.
O
n the subject o
f Felix.Mrs. Butler's
first comment was that, two years ago,
when she came to Imperial, " Felix
seemed to reflect a feeling among
students that they were somehow being
persecuted. " She feels that Felix
has a
n important role in helping the
Union to influence the people who
guide Imperial College.
She thinks we are fortunate in
studying at a college with such a high
academic standard, but considers it a
terrible waste for students to spend
all their time working for a good
Degree.
Regarding noise in Southside, she
feels very much o
n the side o
f the
students. I
n fact Mrs. Butler is o
n
the side o
f students in all things.
She is a very warm person, and is
ideally suited to her position o
f war-
den's wife.

I.C. FOR EXPORT
^ E M B E R S OF the College will, no doubt, be pleased to know
that the College is featured on one of a series of posters, for
release abroad, showing life in Britain.
The series, published by HMSO and
prepared by the Central Office of In-
formation, has been distributed by the
Information Offices of the Diplomatic
service throughout the world.
London Airport, Buckingham Palace,
Westminster, New Scotland Yard are
among the many other aspects of life
shown, together with scenes (on the
" I.C. poster") i n physics, geology,
aeronautics and other departments,
halls of residence and the Field
Station at Virginia Water. Central
Office claim that the poster is not to
encourage students to come to I C (or
even Britain) to study, but merely to
inform, (the posters being displayed
in Universities, schools, libraries etc),
as were the similar posters already
issued on Sierra Leone and the achiev-
ment of independence in Zambia.
The posters are available in the U K
at Is. 6d. plus 6d. postage from the
Central Office of information or
H M S O .
SON OF THUNDER
T H E OLDEST A N D most handsome of the three mobile mascots
of I.C., belongs to Guilds. It is a 1902 James and Browne five-
seat toimeau, called "Boanerges," which means " Son of Thunder."
maining James and Browne cars
which were made at Hammersmith.
The designer of Bo, Lt.-Col. T. B.
Browne, now lives in South Kensing-
ton, and is an Honorary Vice-President
of the C. & G . Motor Club.
The big event of the year for Bo is
the R A C London-Brighton R u n ,
which takes place on 7th November.
Guildsmen always give Bo a good send
off from Hyde Park and after the
run, there is the Motor Club luncheon
in Brighton.
Bo takes the President of Guilds to
Putney on Morphy day, and usually
attends the Lord Mayor's Show, last
year also competing i n the V.C.C.
Rallies in Kensington Gardens and at
Crystal Palace, and did quite well i n
the driving tests.
The college bought Bo from a
Shropshire blacksmith around 1930
to replace a 1905 Rover, which was
found to be too young for the Brighton
Run. It is reputed that Bo lapped
the Brooklands circuit at 29 m.p.h. i n
1929 .
UPSURGE
TT HAS BEEN quite impossible to
'-bold down the fantastic upsurge of
new talent among the musicians of
(he jazz club. New bands have been
ioruicd in every corner of the jazz
club room, and it is rumoured that
the club is looking for additional
premises.
Temporary floor space in the shape
of the Southside M a i n Dining Hall
is being used tonight (Wednesday
Nov. 3rd) to hold the first Southside
stomp of the year. It should be a real
gas; there will be new bands as well
as old, the Jazz Congress being there
to provide the audience with some
rocking modern jazz).
The format of an intimate, candle
lit atmosphere and a bar, found so
successful i n previous years, will be
used again this year. Admission fees
are the same as last year, Is. 6d. for
members and 2s. 6d. for non-members.
Finally, don't worry about the num-
ber of girls there—those jazz club
cats have been working like crazy
distributing posters for the past week
and a half.

NIGHT
PROWL
DO Y O U KNOW that most of
the Oxford Street shops and
stores have a late night every
Thursday ? Well, they do, more
recently until 8.00 pan., but
always 7.30 p.m.
So, all you have to do is to hop on
a 73 bus after lectures and go in the
opposite direction to everyone else—
I recommend that you begin past Ox-
ford Circus and make your way down.
Most of the big stores are on the
right going towards Marble Arch and
then there are a few in Regent Street
too, all the shoe shops, Woolworths,
C. & A . and lots more of course.
There are two Marks and Spencer's,
one just before Oxford Circus and one
at Marble Arch. For the men in your
life, there are lots of sweaters—Botany
Wool, Lambswool and Shetland type
for around £2. These are great for
us girls too—nice and long!
Initialled handkies are coming in
at this time of the year—a box of
3—about 7s. Scarves, under 10s., or
you could treat him to a shirt—quite
smooth—button down denim, two
shades of blue and a good beigey tone
—25s. l i d .
Then for the female side of the
family—they still have lots of pretty
floral blouses, long sleeved, in Tery-
lene cotton and Tricel for39s. lid.and
also lacey-look sweaters in different
colours and white for 24s. l i d . Have
a look at the Courtelle and Orion
counters for the latest sweater and
cardigan trends. Designs that look as
if they've been stolen from the Irish
Fishermen's wives are to be found
on synthetic wool jumpers and are
quite effective—white and colours—
about 38s. (like the Meat G i r l i n
" Catch Us if you Can " wore). I was
intrigued to find a mixture of wool
and Nylon, made up in lovely colours,
coming from Israel. Well, what next?!
I noticed the slipper counter for
those difficult Aunt and Uncle pre-
sents—from 13s. l i d . Anyway, you
will find lots more ideas, if you go
and brouse around, although don't be
be surprised if you can't move in the
scrum ! !
Experimental
Saussages
Here's another budget meal i f you
have a little more room—an experi-
ment with sausages. They are re-
markably versatile and satisfying as
well as good on your purses, so do
some try-out recipes yourselves. I
always go for large pork ones, but you
may prefer the beef and/or chipolata
variety. Then cook them a little,
either frying with some lard or gril-
ling and at the same time boil or fry
about 2 large Spanish-type onions.
When both are almost cooked, put
them, fatless, into an oven-proof cas-
serole with a large tin of Baked Beans
(you have to like them, of course—
Crosse and Blackwell), for about 20
minutes, and presto you have a sup-
per. A d d chips or mash if you like.
This is the kind of meal you could
prepare in advance and then just pop
in your Baby Belling to heat, after
the " flicks " or a " pub."
Conversation overheard in a South
Ken. Restaurant, which I'm sure you
know well, one lunch-time last week.
Two recently " left college " secre-
taries, very refined:—" Of course, the
look these days seems to be com-
pletely white, ao lipstick and all black
eyes.*' " Terilible, and some seem
to think no foundation is necessary,
just a shiny face." " Oh, everyone
should wear a foundation." Garment?
