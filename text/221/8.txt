Why Believe
\
y H Y I N D E E D ! With a grant and a steady girl, the prospect
of a secure and highly remunerative career, and at least forty
years of active life ahead, who needs faith ?
In the next few weeks the Christian
Union asms to shake any I.C. men who
have this cynically complacent out-
look.
Superficially, there are two main
influences causing people to believe:
firstly, the sheer weight of evidence,
and secondly, the objective need to
believe. This second influence is
more far-reaching than we often care
to admit. H o w many ideas' do we
accept practically because we need
them to trot out in the exams?
Religious faith has one further re-
quirement not covered by intellectual
belief. It requires total commitment
and involvement. Christians main-
tain that God uses the intellectual fac-
tors to help people to put their faith
in Christ.
But what was that about the Chris-
tian Union? Well, much time has been
spent presenting the evidence for
Christianity. It is time we confronted
students at I.C. with their need for
faith in Christ. T o this end, we are
holding a series of lunchtime meet-
ings, entitled " Why Believe?" from
November 15th to 19th to consider
such problems as the purpose of life,
the need for security and the fear of
death.
In the evenings, discussion groups
will be held for you to thrash out
sepcifjc problems and air your objec-
tions. Preceding all this (i.e. next
week—why were we not told last year
about R a g Week?) we shall be con-
ducting an opinion poll to get a
clearer idea of current religious belief
in the college.

FOLLOWING HOT on the heels
I of last Thursday's Union Meeting,
where the " Family Planning Inter-
national " charity caused one of the
most lively discussions since N.U.S.,
and also following the successful Hux-
ley Society Meeting where Diane
Monday spoke on the Abortion Law
Reform Association, it is now re-
ported that the Debating Society are
to hold a debate on Thursday, 4th
November on the motion that " this
house believes that abortion should
be made available to prospective un-
married mothers on the National
Health Service." Perhaps this trend is
likely to give the impression that I.C.
is becoming one-track minded?
Asked whether or not this motion
was a little extreme, in view of the
fact that the Queen, Mother will be
visiting I.C. on that very day, a spokes-
man for the Debating Soc. said, " No,
I think it is time that the motions
which are put forward leave no room
for ambiguity. In any case, since the
motion is being proposed by D r
Eustace Chesser, the level of debate
is likely to be very high." Asked
what his own views were on this
topic, the spokesman replied, " I don't
see why any woman should give birth
to a child she doesn't want."
Reports that M r . Mike Edwards,
President of Debates is seeking spiri-
tual guidance before chairing the
meeting on November 4th, are com-
pletely unfounded.
