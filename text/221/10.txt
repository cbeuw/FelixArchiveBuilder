JUDO CLUB
\ UATCH OUT I.C., our girls are fighting back! For the first time the Judo
' * Club is starting a women's section. A t present they have about six girls
interested i n learning the sport and equiping themselves for the fray of I.C.
hops. But these girls take their sport seriously, in spite of being handicapped
by a shortage of space.
With 70 new members this season
space is at a premium and the club
has applied to A.C.C. for extra mats
so that they can use the South Side
room as well for separate women's
practices, and maybe encourage some
of the more timid l . C . girls to go
along.
Men's Win
Our successful men's team, mean-
while, has been fighting to maintain
last year's high standard. They de-
feated both Exeter and Southampton
by a greater margin than a U . L , team
could do, despite the loss this year of
Keith Dugdale, a black belt.
The present team was unlucky to lose
to a strong L.S.E. tea-T the following
Saturday. Surprise of the match came
from Keith Glover, an I.C. blue belt
who convincingly defeated one of
L.S.E.'s two black belts—a Japanese.
This however was not enough to pre-
vent us from losing by only 7 points.

Today
On Morphy D a y the Rifle Club is
hoping.-to take the first step towards
regaining the Engineer's Cup which it
losjf to U . C last year by only a few
points. The match is shot in two
Series, each college meeting all the
others twice, shooting over 25 yards.
Water Polo
The water polo team narrowly
failed to beat a strong U . C . team
containing three internationals, losing
6-5. I.C.'s scorers were, Randall (3),
Stapley and Price and had been 5-4 up
at the end of the third quarter.
SICILY
At Castroreale, near Messina, \ye
have selected a tourist village for
our 1966 Anglo-Italian Centre
for young people. The village is
situated by the sea within easy
reach of the main tourist resorts,
like Taormina or the Aeolian
Islands, and int^an ideal geogra-
phical position for excursions to
sites of'Archaeological interest.
A fortnight there at the beginning
of September will cost 49 Gns. by
air and on full board basis.
For an additional 4 Gns. you can
have 20 hours tuition in Italian.
This holiday is also being widely
advertised among North Italian
University Students.

PULLING OUR WEIGHT
AS THE SIZE of the college increases each year our participation
in University events seams to vary in inverse proportion. This
is not quite so true in the sporting field, but even here there is
often an understandable reluctance on the part of captains to see
their best players disappear, for all but Cup matches, to U.L.
teams. This is the time of year when U.L. final selections are
being made and players not " spotted " by the University now will
probably not wear the purple vest at all this year.
[However much of a loss such players seem at the time, in the long term U.L.
participation can only benefit the college. Our best athletes and sportsmen
will only improve by competing at the highest possible level and their
improvement will spread back through the club.
At Last
START is being made on the Sports Centre! After nearly three years
delay work is at last getting under way—there is a small pile of bricks
on die North Side site and work will start i n earnest on filling in the
hole. Amongst the facilities to be provided are a swimming pool, squash
courts, a rifle range, and, of a}l things, a spectator's gallery and toilets.
There has been little consultation as to what the students themselves
require. In fact even when the centre is complete there will still be fewer
facilities per student than there were i n the past, before all the new building
began.

Cross Country
T O U G H R E L A Y
DRAWING ON TEAMS from as
far away as Leeds and Birmingham
the U.C. re!ay provides an exciting
start to each Cross Country season.
The present I.C. team did not expect
to win any cups against such strong
Opposition as Loughborough and
Borough Road but there was a good
chance of improving last years 13th
place. Hopes fell however as Cana-
dian Pete Schudderboom running 1st
leg for I.C. suffered the consequen-
ces of a Mooney lunch and only just
managed to stagger home in 25th place
before crawling away to slowly die.
Fighting back
Fortunes though were quickly re-
stored by Howard Smith, a fresher,
who ran,a fine second leg to bring us
back into 12th place. That position
was maintained thorough stages 3 and
4 and Ian Jones with joint best time
for the team moved up to 10th place
on the 5th leg leaving the Captain to
bring us to a final 11th place also
with joint best time. In spite of only
moving up one place the average time
per man improved by over 20 sees.
Purple Vests
This time ol the year the club seems
to go nowhere else but Hampstead
Heath and the following week we were
again off to the hills and mud of
Parliament Hill—this time for six
miles of it in a battle for League
points and U . L . places. In a race
where Pete Yates, a Cross Country
international, could only come second
the standard was high and club cap-
tain Howard Dickson ran well to
finish 18th out of 170 and gain a
place in the U . L . second team. With
Pete Schudderboom, this time fore-
going his Mooney, finding some of
his true form the team managed to
finish well up.

DEFENCE
LACKING
IN THE F O U R important matches
played so far this term, I.C. 1st team
has performed rather worse than in
previous years. Against two ad-
mittedly strong club sides, Mer'on
and West Essex, a drastic 9 goals were
conceded. In each case the defence
failed to provide an adequate answer
to the enthusiastic, if not skilful for-
ward lines.
The story against college sides is,
of course, quite different; for so far
the team has beaten L.S.E. 4-0 and
drawn with a strong Kinfjs side 0-0.
The second match was clearly the
more exciting, as in the first L.S.E.
were not too sure of their positional
play : I.C. forwards Hough and Price
were gradually allowed to force their
way deeper into the opposition lines,
and it as encouraging to see some sort
of positional understanding between
the two.
As a result Hough scored a good
goal point before half-time ; and Price
scored twice later on with two shorts
of the highest calibre. Finally Allen
scored a splendid goal past the
keeper's right hand after a 25 yard
solo run.
