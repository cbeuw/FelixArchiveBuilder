We are fortunate at Imperial to have the widest range of clubs and
societies with the best facilities in the University of London. Partici-
pating in clubs provides a marvellous opportunity to develop your
interests as well as to meet and makefriends with a whole host ofpeople
with similar interests.
Vegsoc
Debsoc
Debsoc, as it is known to its friends (not
many-ed) will be providing a full range of
debating activities over the next year. We
have already arranged several debates with
noted speakers from outside College inclu-
ding Winston Churchill MP and television
lecturer Nicholas Humphrey debating the
motion 'This House Supports Unilateral Nu-
clear Disarmament for Britain'. That event
will be on 25 October. Similar debates, con-
cerning Ireland and South Africa have been
arranged and there are more in the pipeline.
As last year, Debsoc will be meeting on a
Monday lunchtime for regular debates with
the society's members speaking on matters of
current interest. We will also be entering a
team in an inter-university debating compe-
tition as well as for the Observer Mace.
Furthermore, debates with other London
colleges are being arranged so one can see
how good, or bad, our contemporaries are.
Debating can also be amusing and we will
be organising several balloon debates during
the year. The first of these will be as part of
SCAB Night—a major event during Rag
Week—on 19 November. If you are in-
terested in any aspect of debating then we
will, of course, be at Freshers' Fair, or turn up
to the first debate of term on Monday 10
October at 12:45pm in Union Upper Lounge.

She screamed.
Naked, she ran, stumbling
on the concrete. Blood
spattered her torn skin. Her
hair, drenched with sweat,
stuck to her shoulders and
back. Somewhere, in the
depths of the shadows, some-
thing moved, oily and slick.
Desperately she sprinted
across the neon-lit stone and
ploughed through the glass
double doors. Splinters and
shards ripped through the air
and danced across the floor.
She slipped in her own blood,
smashing her head on the
marble. She crawled on,
beneath the stark strip lighting
and eventually reached the
double doors.
'Mech Eng 220?' she
whispered not daring to hope.
'Yes. Blade Runner is about
to start.'
A minute later Pallab Ghosh,
carefully avoiding the smeared
tracks of blood, stepped up to
the door, smiling quietly to
himself.

Last year the society held a number of
interesting talks and field visits. The talks
varied widely: Greenpeace on whaling, Lord
Melchett on agriculture and conservation and
another on forensic science. Many field visits
were organised particularly for birdwatching,
but others included a visit to an orchid
reserve, a pinetum and Kew Gardens.
This year we hope to continue with such
variety. Of course it also depends on you, the
new first years, to inject new blood. We hope
some of you will come along to our stall at
Freshers' Fair, or contact me via the Life
Sciences pigeonhole.

What is Vegsoc?
Is it the Venerated Elderly Goons Society, the
Venetican Engraved Gondolas Society or is it
the Vasectomied Elderly Gorillas Soci-ety? It
is, in fact, none of these. VEGSOC simply
stands for Vegetarian Society.
Now you know what VEGSOC means,
what do Veggies (Vegsoc members) do? First
of all I would like to point out that 'veggie'
does not necessarily mean vegetarian. Veg-
gies are small in number but as they say 'small
is beautiful'. The meetings, supper parties, etc
that Vegsoc hold have a friendly personal
atmosphere that can only be achieved in a
small society.
Every Thursday lunch time Vegsoc takes
lunch at the RCA, meeting outside Beit Arch
between 12:30 and 12:45pm. There are fort-
nightly supper parties, to which veggies bring
a vegetarian dish. (Marks & Spencer seems to
provide quite a lot of vegetable dishes which
easily pass as home cooking.)
The 'restaurant trips' last year were a great
success. One advantage with vegetarian and
health food restaurants is, they are cheap!
Vegsoc parties were also an evening well
spent. Special thanks goes to Anil and His
Punch, it will never be forgotten by Aunty
Epps I'm sure!
So if you want to eat veggie food in a
friendly atmosphere join VEGSOC at the
Freshers' Fair or contact: Miss J Billing
Chem 1; Miss F Alii Maths 2; or, Miss I Epps
Maths 2, via the letter-racks.
Ladies Rugby
Monday,October3 WB3\
The next best thing to mud wrestling
Have you ever felt there was more to life than
motherhood and the kitchen sink? Well, this
could be it. Ladies' Rugby is a challenging
sport requiring skill and agility. Don't be
shied off by those archaic preconceptions that
rugby players have to be six by six foot and
thick as two short planks—though it might
help. Seriously, we'll take anyone with femi-
nine tendencies.
Come along to the first practice session on
Thursday 6 October. Meet at 10:00 in Beit
Quad or see us at the Freshers' Fair.
