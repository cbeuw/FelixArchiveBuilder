THE HANDBOOK ALTERATIONS
Adrian James writes about the alterations made to the ICU Handbook by the Exec.

Bars and Refectories
As you should have gathered
from Hugh Southey's article on
page 6 of this Handbook, the
College refectories are not the
best places to eat. However, if
you must eat there (and only a
small percentage of students do
regularly) here is a guide to them
and their alternatives.
Sherfield Refectory: the lar
gest and most popular outlet, this
provides several main courses
and desserts, school dinner style.
Possibly the least disgusting
refectory; there is usually an
incomprehensibly large queue of
people wanting to eat there.
The Sherfield Refectory is also
used for formal College dinners
(see later).
Southside: Even the water
here is badly served. The food is
either recycled from the Sher-
field kitchens, or frozen and
(barely) thawed out. Very few of
the staff speak any language
other than Spanish, which means
that when you ask for the grey
sludge that looks like curry you
will be given the green sludge that
looks like lasagne, and then when
you complain about being over-
charged, the staff will jabber at
you in some obscure Catalonian
dialect.
The Union Refectory was
moved and re-vamped last year
at great expense, none of it
justified. It now serves 'fast food'
(we won't go into why it's called
that): chips, beans, hamburgers,
sausages, plus a 'dish of the day'
(normally the day before) which
is cooked in the Sherfield kit-
chens and re-heated.
This room also contains a
Lounge Bar which dispenses
much-needed liquid refreshment
and what are optimistically, des-
cribed as 'Ploughman's
Lunches', although any self-
respecting ploughman would
feed them to his horse. This is
little used, most people pre
ferring the Union Bar next door,
where soggy rolls and pies are
dispensed.
The JCR Buttery in the
Sherfield Building sells mostly
pies, chips, sandwiches and
pasties, which are comparable
wtth what you would get at a
British Rail buffet if you weren't
In the introduction to the
CCUs (page 30) and the article on
refectories (page 43) I had written
that the food and drink served at
Freshers' Dinners was simply not
worth Â£7 (however heavily subsi-
dised) and that the only reason
for attending these functions
would be to meet people. I am
still of that opinion, and from the
RCSU's refusal to pay for one of
last year's dinners and the recent
move in City and Guilds Union
to abolish the dinners entirely, it
would seem that other people
share my views. Furthermore, I
would point out that very few
students other than freshers and
virtually no members of staff
bother to attend these dinners, so
that they merely provide an
opportunity for freshers to meet
other freshers.
The Exec removed my para-
graph on formal dinners from
page 43 (and, for some reason
known only to themselves, one
on catering in Linstead Hall) and
replaced it with one encouraging
freshers to attend the dinners. It
is reprehensible behaviour on the
part of the Exec (who will all, of
course, be invited to many formal
dinners throughout the year) to
try to mislead freshers into
parting with their money; no
serious attempt to improve the
standard of these functions has
yet been made by them.
Finally, having really got into
the swing of things, they altered
the introduction to the Who's
Who of Administrators on page
36, removing sentences at ran-
dom and replacing them with bits
of last year's Handbook, which
are no less insulting and rather
less up-to-date. To add insult to
injury, Gaynor Lewis insisted on
removing the caption from the
Rector's photograph, which
makes the reference to it in my
Editorial obscure to say the least.
The reason she gave for this was
that she would be embarrassed at
future meetings with Lord
Flowers if she felt that he had
been made fun of in a Union pub-
lication; I fear he will be more
worried by the text concerning
him (which is serious) than he
would have been by the photo-
graph (which wasn't).

A Warning
If for religious or other reasons,
you cannot eat some types of
food, do not believe anything that
the refectory slaff tell you. Fen

minorities who are ot allowed I
t
