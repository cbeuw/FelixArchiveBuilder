Arthur
Again
Dear Pallab
Having read the article and
your editorial in the Postgrad
FELIX on Michael Arthur I
can only agree with your
conclusions that he "couldn't
give a toss about ordinary
students".
Last year I desperately
needed accommodation during
term time and found his atti-
tude of studied indifference to
my plight very frustrating. In
the end I was provided with an
expensive, cramped, uncomfor-
table and very unsatisfactory
room which, with exams ap-
proaching I was in no position
to refuse. Mr Arthur has a
'captive audience' of students
and seems to, as far as I can tell,
take advantage of this. I sign
anonymously to avoid possible
'complications' in future at the
Accommodation Centre.

Dear Pallab
I would like to apologise to
all freshers for several major in-
accuracies in this year's Hand-
book. As you know, the final
copy was recalled from the
printers by MessrsLewis, Teller
and Davis following a
complaint from an RCSU
official that I had questioned
the value of Freshers' Dinners.
As a result, the Exec re-wrote
several pieces of text against my
express wishes—in fact, I felt
strongly enough about this to
resign my post as Editor,
although as the work was all
finished this was no major
disaster.
By the time students read the
Handbook, they are committed
to coming to Imperial and so
will not be put off by an honest,
unbiased view of the College.
That is the very purpose of the
Handbook. Of course I agree-
that the Union should have
some control over material
printed on its behalf, and for the
six weeks during which I was
preparing the Handbook any
Union Officer was welcome to
read what I had written. As it
happens, the Exec left it until
the day when they knew print-
ing was • due to start, and

recalled the copy from the
printers to replace editorial ma-
terial with the kind of bland,
uninformative waffle that im-
parts no knowledge and gives a
very'wrong impression of life at
IC.
Yours sincerely

Voice of
Experience
Dear Ed
As another Freshers' Week
begins at IC, I think it's a good
time to record some of the old
views about the importance of
involvement in IC Union. The
College and the Students'
Union provides buildings and
facilities but these are only
frameworks for the people who
use them, for without these
people—YOU—the College
does not exist.
One of the most important
parts of a University education
is the exchange and develop-
ment of views with fellow
students, and a climate to
achieve this is possibly the
difference between our form of
education and any other. If you
never do anything then you can
never expect to have this
contact; and therefore active
participation in some part of
College life is an absolute
necessity.
In departments, where one
works, student meets student
and views are exhanged. In
halls, which unfortunately not
everyone is lucky enough to
inhabit, one will meet people
with whom one's only apparent
connections are eating, sleeping
and living next door, but much
can be gained from such
unlikely friendships.
In the Union clubs one
encounters students with whom
one has common interests. If an
active part is taken in the club
then these are the people with
whom one will mix most, be it
travelling to a game, over coffee
before a meeting, or sharing a
room on tour.
These personal contacts
which you will develop are the
very substance of university life,
and unless advantage is taken of
them your education will be
incomplete.
As in every sphere of life
participation brings its own
rewards and IC Union is no
exception. The facilities are
available, as you will see on the
afternoon of 4 October when all
the clubs will be on display, but
the onus is on the individual to
make the best use of them. If
you feel that something else is
needed, make your opinion
known and then do something
about it—this is your Union.
You will have met most of the
Union Officers by this time,
remember that they are your
officers and approachable as
such.
Combine a successful
academic career; a well rounded
personality derived from a
breadth of interests; and an
ability to deal with people and
affairs, derived from an active
Union life, and you will have
received a true university
education. Good luck with
FELIX this year.
Cheers!

Rector
Resigns
Dear Sir
Having been a student here for
several years I like to think that I
have developed a strong sense of
loyalty to the Imperial Collse of
Science and Technology and
what is more, a personal loyalty'
to our leader. Imagine my shock
and dismay on glancing at page
four of your last issue. The
offensive headline "Rector
Resigns" was placed at the top of
the page in letters more than half-
an-inch high!
Although closer examination
showed that this referred to the
Rector of the Royal College of
Art.
Of course it's OK to have fun
and undergraduate pranks are
acceptable. But please, no more
tricks.
Good luck.

Baron Who?
Dear Sir
Having read your first
FELIX, I feel that I have to
complain about the amount of
totally fabricated material
which you chose to put in it. I.
realise that you had a limited, if
not zero, amount of input from
students not connected with
FELIX, but did you have to go
out of your way to invent
characters to fill your letters
page and artificial small ads
which have been deliberately
misleading. One unfortunate
student, having read the small
ad concerning the hot bikes
going cheap, rushed off to
Mend-a-Bike to purchase one,
only to find that he had been
deliberately misled by the only
publication which a student
should be able to believe. So, no
more fabrication please!
Yours faithfully

FELIX
Fabrication
Dear Pallab
A rumour has come to my
attention which I find hard to
believe. Having spent less than
a year at IC, I am suspicious
that my leg is being pulled. As
you are, as FELIX Editor, the
source of all information for
students, I wonder if you can
clear up the confusion.
The point is this: Is our
Rector, Lord Flowers, really
the Baron of Queensgate? How
far does the Barony of Queens-
gate extend? Does it in fact
contain any or all of the IC
campus? Is Lord Flowers not
only our Rector, but our Ruler
as well?
Yours in anticipation
Diane Love

Physics PG
/ believe that the Barony of
Queensgate has no geographical
boundaries. Our Rector has
merely chosen to incorporate his
address into his name in order to
improve his status with, all his
trendy SDP friends-Ed.
