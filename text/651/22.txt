Hello and welcome once again to the What's On page. This week is, of
course, packed with events for freshers and a ticket covering all events is
available from the Union Office, price £7.
For the benefit of freshers and to remind others, I'd like to explain how
What's On works. Forms are available in the FELIX Office for special
events and for regular meetings. 'Regular' forms are kept onfileand
'special' forms are thrown away after use, so make sure you use the right
form! Please send in any relevant photos or drawings—these will be
returned. The deadline for entries is 12:30pm on Mondays.
The information you give is printed in an upright face; my cynical
comments are added in italic. Lastly, while I and my minions try to be
infallible, we occasionally make mistakes, and therefore take no
responsibility for entries lost, misprinted or mutilated.

FELIX Staff Meeting. If you
can write, draw, take photos,
have nice legs or are gullible,
the Editor would like to meet

journalism, graphics or just
the sex and scandal that finds
its way to the FELIX Office will
find being a FELIX staff member
is great fun. No previous experi-
ence required-you will be

know.
