At National Express,we've been checking
our sums.
And we've found that students can travel
far more cheaply on our coaches than on
British Rail.
In a random sample of over 300 main
routes, more than 90% of our fares turned
out to be cheaper. And the British Rail fares
were an average of 70% higher.
This applies if you hold a validated
International Student Identity Card (ISIC).
You're then able to travel by National
Express coach to over 1,500 destinations in
England and Wales for two-thirds of the
full fare-or less.
Booking is easy.
Just contact your student travel office
or any National Express ticket agent.There's
no fiddling around with
special travel cards-just
show your ISIC.
You can go any
time of the week, all year-
there are no irritating restrictions.
And as we're the simplest and cheapest
way for students to get from A to B,we won't
be a strain on your resources.
