Stop
The
Presses!
The artwork for this years ICU
Handbook was recalled from the
printers only hours before the
copy deadline, in a last minute
censorship bid.
Fuming
The call to stop the presses came
from ICU President Gaynor
Lewis. The fuming sabbatical
phoned the printers as soon as
she learnt of certain 'offensive'
articles in the Handbook.
But the editor Adrian James was at
the printers when the censorship
call came through. He was ordered
to return to the FELIX Office, and
bring his artwork with him.
Amazed
Amazed Adrian said "I went
rigid when I heard the news; it
was like a bolt from the blue." He
stormed back to IC to face the
executive rumpus. They
announced that they should have
read the Handbook before it
went to the printers.
The reason that theyfailed to do so
was that they didn't expect the
Handbook to be produced on time!
Adrian James pointed out that
this was their own fault and
threatened to resign if any
changes were made in the Hand-
book.
And Publications Supremo David
Rowe reluctantly accepted
Adrian's decision.
Frantic
It was then left to FELIX staff to
make the changes that the Exec
demanded. The team worked
frantically through the night in a
bid to minimise the delay caused
by the censorship mix-up.
And only days later the Exec
censors struck again.
But this time their target was the
Rag Mag, edited by Carl Burgess.
The ruthless trio were let loose on
the Mag with a fine toothcomb
removing jokes indiscriminately.
Mr Burgess was too upset to
comment.
The Last Laugh
Carl Burgess,Rag mag Editor,having been instructed by an aloof and
unfeeling executive to destroy the products of his deranged mind set about the
dismantling of his publication with his customary gusto.This leads us to a very
intriguing question of what humour is and do people have a right to laugh at
anybody else.Here is a case for the defence.
How do you fuck a vegetable?
Eat his wheelchair
Now this joke is extremely de-
rogatory but you can see how
funny it is only if you are not
anticipating the answer. Only
people who think that invalids
are mental deficients would think
like that and I can only say I was
impressed by the multi-layered
play on words in this joke. I think
being offensive is a matter of
intent; I did not deliberately at-
tempt to be offensive, I was only
attempting to find the jokes I
found the most amusing and put
them in.
What have Princess Grace and
Sue Barker got in common?
They've both been fucked by
Cliffs.
Whats the difference between
Princess Grace and Glen Hoddle?
Hoddle can take corners.
Well here again the joke is on
the play on words. I don't have
anything against any of the above
characters, it's just that I found
the jokes funny.
Eighty epileptics committed suicide
yesterday after a t t e m p t i n g a w o r l d
record when they failed to fit in a
telephone booth.
This was just a play on words. I
admit I thought this one up and I
was only trying to be funny. I'm
sorry if 1 failed.
Did you hear about Stunted
Willie Jackson the Worlds
first thalidomide pop singer
with his No 1 song 'I've got
a puncture in my wheel-
chair and my arms aren't
long enough to change the
tyre blues'.
Now this is just one of the most
amazingly funny things I have
ever heard. It's even comparable
with Red Sovine's Teddy Bear,
and if that got to number one,
what's all the complaint about?
What have niggers and hyptothermia got
in common?
They both attack old people.
Well here we have the token
racist joke. This was told to me by
my little brother. I found it very
funny because again it was based
upon a certain characteristic
given to certain groups.
ie Rastus — large member
Irishmen — thick
Jews — miserly
and so on and so forth.
H o w d o y o u k i l l a g e r i a t r i c ?
a) h o o k their w a l k i n g sticks to t h e
back of a bus.
b) p l u g their h e a r i n g aids into t h e
mains.
Hhy did the old lady cross the road?
Because she didn't see the jugger-
naut.
I got home one night and
picked up a copy of the Number l
Sun and my mind was over-
whelmed by the amazingly witty
way they wrote about geriatric
\ Monday.October 3 1983 \
muggings and such like and so I
pondered deeply on the subject
and came up with the above,
again I am not trying to be
offensive about geriatrics. After
all I'm going to be one (I hope).
Why did the elephant cross the road?
Because it was stapled to the baby's
head.
What do you call several babies drowned in
apple juice?
Infanticider.
The first joke was just a piss-
take on all the cross the road
jokes starting with
Why did the chicken
then
Why did the baby
So, the natural progression was
Why did the elephant
Again I tried my best to be
amusing with this one.
The second is just a play on
words which I thought was quite
clever. I am not going to go
around drowning babies or any
other such infant. Babies are nice
and cuddly. I used (?) to be a baby
myself.
Some of the grossest jokes were
from sickie Sean Davis, our
demented Irish Hon Sec. Quite
naturally he did not want it to be
known what a filthy little mind he
has so he censored his name from
the credits.
On a final note if you didn't
find any of the above in the least
bit funny please feel free to write
to the FELIX Office and tell me
why.
If you got any jokes you feel
offended by please send them in
and state your reasons.
Felix
