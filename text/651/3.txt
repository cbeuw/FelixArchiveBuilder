No fun in Southsidc—Official
New students arriving in the
Southside Halls of Residence will
have to agree to a stiff new set of
regulations devised by College or
face expulsion from the Hall.
These regulations have been
drafted to pacify the Mews
residents who live around Col-
lege.
This is the result of a long
running campaign by Mews
residents who object to the noise
and disturbance originating from
the Southside Halls. Several
incidents have recently increased
the level of protest, these include
a bottle crashing through a
skylight and eggs posted through
letterboxes. This is especially
serious because certain residents
employ armed bodyguards with
orders to shoot first and ask
questions later.
A meeting was held late last
session to discuss this problem,
the meeting involved the War-
dens, Estates, Don Monro and
the then President Stephen Goul-
der. This was followed by a
meeting between the Rector and
representatives of the residents
during the summer in his office
on Level 5. Despite the Wardens
and local policeman Paul
Gooderson being present outside
they were never invited to contri-
bute. The Rector, however,
strongly supported student in-
terests arguing that a certain level
of noise must be expected.
The draft regulations that
emerged from the discussion
included:
•No noise after 11:00pm
•No shouting out of the windows.
•No activity designed to cause
annoyance or disturbance
Breach of these regulations
could result in residents being
liable to expulsion from Hall.
If these regulations are not
effective then the residents may
take legal action. If they do
obtain a court injunction against
further nuisance the situation is
potentially very serious. Each
further disturbance would then
constitute a contempt of court. If
the nuisance still persists then
Southside could be closed.

LST
quit
London Student Travel were told
to quit Imperial College during
the summer by Deputy President
.Christine Teller. She took this
action after discovering that LST
were using their current office
rent free and were contributing
no money to IC Union, one of
their principal shareholders.
LST moved into Imperial
College in 1978 when they were
allowed to occupy a room in the
Union Building. They were
formed as a partnership between
the Exchange Travel Group and
various London student unions
with the aim of providing cheap
travel for students. They oper-
ated rent free for the first year to
enable them to become estab-
lished.
In the years that followed LST
moved to the Walkway in Sher-
field. However, successive Depu-
ty Presidents failed to formalise
their contract and LST continued
to occupy an office rent free.
Christine Teller discovered this
state of affairs and told LST that
this situation was intolerable. She
asked for a written offer within a
month. LST failed to come up
with any suitable offer in time
and they were requested to leave
the campus.
This should come as no
surprise since LST have not lived
up to expectations. They have
been providing a poor service,
and have allegedly provided large
profits for their parent company
as a result of the preferential
treatment they receive from
student unions.
Winking Legal
The Tiddlywinks Rag Stunt will
be held again at its traditional
venue in Oxford Street this year.
The stunt, usually held on the
second Saturday of term, was
transferred to the Kings Road
last year after complaints from
the Police.
The collection will be made on
1
5 October for MENCAP using
their cans and licences. These can
be collected between 9:00am and
9:30am from CCU offices and
More Racist Tory Cuts
from here will move off to
Marble Arch. The finish will
be held at Eros at 12:30 where
ICU sabbaticals will lead 'Ring-
a-Roses' around Eros. Gaynor j
Lewis will call a 'Hey Vivo' j
before everyone adjourns to the j
Cockney Pride for a well-earned
drink.
(Gaynor tells me that she
will buy a pint for anyone who
comes up to her in the Cockney
Pride after the Rag stunt-Ed.)
The Department of Education
and Science has effectively re-
versed the House of Lords
judgement concerning the classi-
fication of overseas students.
This means that a number of
students at IC who had been
classed as home students last
session will have to register as
overseas students and face bills of
up to £2,700.
To be classed as a home
student a person had to prove
that he was resident in the UK or
the EEC for three years prior to
the start of the course.
In 1978 Lord Denning ruled
that foreign nationals who had
moved to the UK to study before
they undertook a degree course
did not satisfy the Ordinary
Residence regulation. This deci-
sion reached the House of Lords
on appeal and was overturned in
December 1982. The decision left
universities open to be sued for
recovery of fees income and
LEAs liable for an increased
