As every student knows, reminding
mum how much she enjoyed doing your
washing is just one of the advantages of
having aYoung Person's Railcard.
The Railcard gets you half price
Awayday and Ordinary tickets on most
trains. So you can afford to go home more
often as well as seeing more of the country.
The Railcard lasts a whole year and
costs only £12 - it could easily pay for itself
the first time you use it.
And anyone under 24 can buy one.
Pick up a leaflet with all the details
(including certain minimum fares) at your
Student Travel Office, most stations and at
British Rail appointed travel agents.
If you bring two recent passport size
photos, proof that you're under 24 and £12
with you, you can buy a Young Person's
Railcard on the spot.
You won't regret it. (Though your
mother might.)
This is the age of the train
