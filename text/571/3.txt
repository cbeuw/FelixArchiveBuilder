Dept. First year U G s , as in
previous years, find his lecturing
style so dull, and the monotonous
tone of his voice so conducive to
reading F E L I X in the Common
Room on Friday mornings, that
attendance at his weekly lecture
is currently decreasing exponen-
tially with time. As for those
creeps who go to his problem
class — huh!

PS: M r Reuter Departmental
Head, still hasn't got his PhD.
He'd better get a move on if he
wants one before retirement age.

Dear Sir
C Parnells behaviour in a Life
Science tutorial group this term
was so bad that I wish to tell the
rest of IC how much I detest him.
He continually does all the
problem sheets and shows the rest
of the group up. I speak for the
rest of the group when I ask for
this trend to stop — or for him to
show his answers to us before the
tutorial.

Sir
A t this time of the year
reflection and evaluation pre-
occupy the thoughts of most of
the populace. Here at IC I think
it is time we examined the
performance of those we elected
to office at the last sabbatical
elections. If this motley charade
was a T V series it would be
mildly jocular, however, it is not
a series and it is not funny. Let us
examine the ignoble assembly of
ciphers and rubber stamps.
The I C U President, M r John
' P i s t m o r e ' Passmore's most
memorable action has been to
waste £500 of Union funds on a
disaster that can only be regarded
as T i t a n i c . T h i s recalls the
Churchillian phrase "Never has
so much been owed to so many
by so few" (shome mishtakc here
shurely). His quick return after
the kidnap was very illuminating
as it transpired that they had got
the wrong man; some would say
"so have we".
It would be nice to have a good
word to say about our sherry
slurping Deputy President, Ms
Rae Snee. She has postured for
far too long resting merely on
the lustre of the position and not
on any noticeable work rate. She
is i he anonymous member of the
Exec content to surround herself
with the benighted hacks of
RC'.SU. Any member of Council
will have seen at close hand her
basic lack of knowledge of I C U
Standing Orders and procedure.
She lias the reputation in F E L I X
of "not knowing" more than any
other Union Officer; her most
frequent quotable statement
being " O h , I'm not sure".
Miss Liz Lindsay recovered
well from her initial demise of
organising one of the most poorly
attended Freshers' U G M s in
post-War I C U history. In fact,
her recovery to last week's
attendance of six hundred is
laudible. However, her general
demeanour is either one of
patronising good humour or
abusive intolerance.
Last and least is the F E L I X
Editor whose lack of Christmas
copy is forcing me to write this
catalogue of wasted time. He is
quoted as saying he only really
enjoyed the first issue. Indeed,
who are wek as mere students to
disagree?
It is thus clear to me that we
elected to office a questionable
rabble that almost approach in
intellectual cornpetance luke-
warm B U L L S H I T ! I would be
the last to indulge in mudslinging
and pointless criticism, so in view
then of similar criticism of the
Exec by the other 4499 students
at IC I think that something must
be done. Indeed, the Exec must
not only apologise for their crass
mishandling of Union affairs but
for their very existence.
As for the F E L I X Editor not
only has he the habits and
standards of personal hygiene of
an A a r d v a r k with intestinal
parasites, but apaently wears its
old clothes.

Dear Sir
I would like to complain about
the abundance of harsh, uncon-
structive criticism 'gracing' if I
may use so refined a term, the
letters page of F E L I X . Surely the
writers of these vile character
assassinations are nothing more
than frustrated, useless, mindless,
jelly-livered, pox-ridden vermin,
and rather than be allocated
space on the letters page to
spread their putrescent propa-
ganda they should be forced to
crawl back to the slimy flea-
ridden wormhoies whence they
came.

Sir,
I must protest most strongly
about the way F E L I X treated
the motion casting aspertions on
the Editor. M a k i n g nonsence
out of such a carefully worded
m o t i o n that so d a m n i n g l y
condemned you should not be
permitted at U G M s . Further-
more, I can find no trace of a
F E L I X orator in the F E L I X
Constitution. I think you owe
those at the U G M an apology
for expressing your views.

Council
Report
T H E M A I N P O I N T of the
President's report was the policy
decision over places in Halls of
Residence. He said that Don
Munro had agreed to let all third
year first applicants get into Hall
in the 1981/2 session and after
that College will be able to
guarantee at least one year in
H a l l . In a d d i t i o n , as the
numbers of overseas students
continues to fall there will be
more room for postgraduates,
m a r r i e d students a n d r e -
applicants. John further reported
on the a m i c a b l e discussion
between Rhodes Boyson, Rae
Snee and himself at the D E S and
that student financing will be
guaranteed nationally via a
central payment to the University
Grants Commission to which the
University sends its claims for
funds which the institution
concerned pays a grant to its
student union. John also clarified
his position over the Swinterton-
Dyer controversy.
At Governing Body the idea
that Imperial College should
become independent of London
University and form a separate
university possibly along with
Q E C and Chelsea will be dis-
cussed.
Liz reported that the I N C O S T
Conference will take place after
all as there are fifty delegates
committed to coming.
T h e absence of the P W P
Chairman meant that his report
was referred to the next Council
meeting.
Chaplaincy
Accusation
CHI RHO, the magazine of the
West London Chaplaincy, not
noted for its controversial stories
contained some rathercontentious
material in its issue of December
7, 1980. The magazine contained
this rather unusual sentence
refering to the passage of the
motions at the last I C U U G M :
"I hope Chaplaincy members
will turn out in force, and bring
people a l o n g to the U n i o n
Meetings next term to defend
these resolutions from reactionary
alliances of M i n e s a n d the
Liberal Club".
Members of the Liberal Club
approached were astonished that
they should belabellcd reactionary
whereas there was no mention of
Consoc despite the fact that two
of its prominant members spoke
in the debate. The statement that
there was any alliance was
' c o n f i r m e d by a member as
"having no substance".
Fred Sanger
atlC
D R F R E D S A N G E R one of the
joint winners of the 1980 Nobel
Prize for Chemistry and Nobel
Laureate of 1958 spoke to a
packed lecture theatre last
Thursday. He was fulfilling a
commitment he made before
knowing he had won the Nobel
prize, even though he was to
receive the award in Stockholm
on Monday, December 8.
The lecture he gave was almost
identical to that which he gave in
Stockholm containing results
that were unpublished and which
are of fundamental importance
in the field of molecular genetics.
H e began the lecture by
outlining the method of sequenc-
ing D N A (Deoxyribose Nucleic
Acid) developed by him at the
M R C Molecular Biology Labora-
tory in Cambridge. Before it was
developed, he said, it could take
nearly a year to sequence a
stretch of five hundred bases
simply by partial enzymatic
digestion. The method he pion-
eered was the + - technique
which is based not on degrcdation
but upon the synthesis of a
complementary strand of D N A (c
DNA). To obtain a sufficient
amount of D N A to sequence the
most modern methods of genetic
manipulation are used. T h e
desired fragment of D N A is
excised using specific restriction
endonucleases, the fragment is
then inserted into a viral D N A
and the virus is then left to
replicate.
He then discussed his work on
the human mitochondria, a sub-
cellular organelle with its own
D N A . He showed that his results
indicated that the coding of the
genetic information is unlike anv
known prokaryote or eukaryote.
It contained the first known
variation in the code with a
codon previously only known as
stopping transcription coding for
an amino acid.
In dealing with questions he
displayed genuine courtesy and
was very frank in his answers. He
sat down to prolonged applause
from an appreciative audience.
Another Gong
for Bill
M R BILL W E S T has flown off to
Paris to receive another medal
from the Polish government in
Exile. Bill, a College maintenance
technician and Pearly King has
already received decorations for
"oustanding bravery" in the last
war. The Polish Prime Minister
in Exile is presenting Bill with the
Officers Cross of the Order of the
Polomia Restituta. His wife June
is to receive the Gold Cross of
Merit.
