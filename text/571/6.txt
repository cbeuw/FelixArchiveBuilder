Preamble
Well, here it is: the bumper puzzle page you were
promised last week, with a total of £20 in prizes.
For each of the four puzzles marked with a sword (t)
there is the usual prize of £2, which will be awarded to
the first correct solution drawn at noon on Wednesday,
January 7. In addition, for the person who gets the most
puzzles right, there is a cash prize of £2 plus a £10
voucher redeemable at the Victoria Bicycle
Company in Pimlico Road. We are very grateful to the
managers for donating this prize.
The unmarked puzzles are much easier than my
usual weekly offering. They are just for Christmas
entertainment (for those with warped minds) and can all
be solved without recourse to a calculator. Answers are
on page eight (with the answer to last week's puzzle)
but try not to cheat till you've spent at least fifteen
minutes on each.
All but one of the puzzles so far have been original,
but to ensure some really ingenious stuff for the holiday
I have adapted a few of my favourites from other
setters. Hopefully I have covered my tracks well
enough to prevent any solvers recognising the sources,
which are pretty obscure anyway.
I am particularly grateful to my friend Grey Spider
for the beautiful chess puzzle. Unlike last week's, it
doesn't use any 'special' moves, just the absolute basics
of chess. In fact, it's quite straightforward and quite
difficult!
Answers to sworded puzzles, as usual, to me c/o
FELIX Office.
Have fun, Merry Christmas, good luck and may the
rate of change of momentum be with you.
Scaramouche
Splinter (Black) fKamikaze Chess Wodge was playing Splinter in the Chess Club
and the game had reached the unlikely
position shown in the diagram. It was white to
move.
"I may as well give up," muttered Splinter,
resignedly. " Y o u couldn't lose from that
position if you tried."
The effect on Wodge was quite remarkable.
He suddenly sat very rigidly in his seat with a
look of intense concentration on his face, and
remained like this for several minutes. Just as
we were wondering whether to call a doctor
he looked up with a sudden jerk and replied
"Yes I could! Isn't that astonishing." He then
proceeded to show us how, from the position
the game had reached, he could force Splinter
to checkmate him, no matter how hard he
(Splinter) tried to avoid doing so.
Of course, both sides were still bound by
the normal rules of chess, in particular the
rule which forbids you to leave your king in
check.
So here's the problem: White to plav — and
lose!

the seven staff each select a

What is the probabi/ify that

^Silent Audit
Accountants are never without their share of problems,
but I got more than I bargained for when I agreed to audit
the accounts of the monastery of St Germoline the
antiseptic. It seems the monks are under a vow of silence
which prohibits them from saying anything unless it is
absolutely necessary; talking to auditors, I discovered, is
not.
Still ^ the
not.
Still, I have been making progress. I was in the
devotional aids shop this morning, and as I was trying to
remember the difference between a hassock and a
cassock, six monks entered the shop.
"One candle each," said one of them, curtly. "AH
different sizes." Not another word was spoken as each of
them in turn handed the shopkeeper £.1 and was given a
candle and a different amount of change.
For a moment I was puzzled as to how the shopkeeper
knew which monk wanted which size candle. But as soon
as I had worked this out. I dashed to the till and counted
the contents. One quick calculation later, I knew that
the six had just taken the total of £.1.66 in change, so I
was able to deduce the price of each candle.
How much are the six different sizes of candle?
- « i me dark
A t the moment I am in the darkroom about to do some
developing, but there is light-sensitive material a l l
around me, so to find out what a storage jar contains, I
have to look at the label with a torch, while covered
with a blanket.
N o w three chemicals are needed to develop films:
developer, stop and fixer. In the darkroom there are
nine jars, three of each chemical stored o n three
shelves, with three jars to a shelf.
Unfortunately darkroom users are rather lax about
putting each jar back on its proper shelf, so that although
you can always be sure that each shelf holds three
jars, y o u cannot tell what the jars contain without
reading the labels.
Nevertheless, I have ascertained from the previous
darkroom user that there is a jar of developer o n each
shelf, but no fixer on the top shelf. More than that he
couldn't remember.
H o w many jars must I inspect under the blanket to find
one of each chemical?
