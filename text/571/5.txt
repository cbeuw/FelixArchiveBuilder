Episode Six
The village church had stood for some time; indeed to
even the oldest inhabitant, sat in his warmest corner
in the snuggest bar of the village hostelry, the church
had stood for all time.
In the belfry, the bats squeaked and chattered in
senseless badinage, swapping pointless anecdotes of
wasted time.
As the train pulled in the driver glanced at his
i watch: 10:30pm - fate. He peered through the
window of the Stationmaster's kitchen and noticed
only an empty plate on the table. The Stationmaster's
wife had cooked some strawberry tarts a while
earlier, but now, they were all gone.
