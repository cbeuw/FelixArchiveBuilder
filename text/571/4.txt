Greetings fellow mortals! So the season of
cheer is once more upon us — I can smell the
burning turkey and stodgy pud now. As is
usual I shall be exchanging gifts with my
friends, but whilst pruning roses the other day
a strange thought struck me. Why not buy
gifts for all those stars at College as well!
Here's my suggested list:
John Passmore: one blank IC Unioncheque
and a ticket to see No Dice at their next
London gig. (After all, he won't want to miss
them a second time.)
Rachel Jane: Miss Snee obviously gets the
booby prize — her own set of canoe paddles.
Liz Lindsay: a plastic halo for being such a
clean and wholesome person (damn!).
Steve Marshall: An afternoon spending
spree in the men's department of Oxfam.
Lord Flowers: medical insurance.
V i c t o r M o o n e y : Brochitis (after all "it
tastes just as good coming up as it does going
down").
His successor: my best wishes and a
request to give these poor student wretches a
decent meal!
Capt Lindley RN: a bottle of Matey bubblje
bath and a new plastic tug for bath time.
Dare Afolabi: a writing set with pre-
addressed envelopes to the FELIX Office. Also
a forged apology from Steve Marshall to try
and keep him quiet for five minutes.
• And for my friends on the FELIX staff:
Stephen Goulder (News Ed and Direc-
tor of Propaganda): a little credibility at
U G M s and mouthclamps to stop him
shouting Piffle! Small-minded cretin! Manifest
Bullshit, Sir! and on occasions, Quorum!
Caroline G o d i n (a painted strumpet
who hangs around and pastes up): a new
set of sensible clothes (like Mrs T) to replace
those purple and yellow things she now
flaunts.
Patrick Coll (Staff Orator and Inter-
viewer-in-Chief): a tape recorder with a
microphone able to pick up even the distant
stomach rumbles of quivering fear within his
unsuspecting victims.
Scaramouche: Even nuns get screwed in
their coffins (6, 2, 6).
Phil Webb (Sports Editor): a gold medal
for effort (well done!).
