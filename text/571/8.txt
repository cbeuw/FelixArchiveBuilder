W H A T M A K E S P E O P L E volunteer to go on a
kibbutz? A r e they just after a holiday with a
difference? Are they running or hiding? In
his first play, Paul Kember throws together a
hotchpotch of misfits and puts them in a
kibbutz somewhere near the Gaza Strip.
What transpires is a play which asks a lot of
questions about motivationandtheclasssystem,
but fails to give a satisfactory answer. It leaves
one feeling angry, but unsure of who to direct
this anger against. M r Kember would have us
believe that the 'English Disease' is due to the
class structure of our society. T h e workers feel
that they don't control their own destiny, but
are not well educated enough to do anything
about it.
Some of the characters are rather obvious
stereotypes, especially the two women. T h e
fantasising pseudo-intellectual Carrie is very
u n d e r d e v e l o p e d a n d G i l a p r o v i d e s love
interest. T h e m a i n d i a l o g u e a n d m a t u r e
analysis comes in interplay between M i k e , a
disgruntled Cambridge d r o p o u t , who found
and rejected 'Englishmen', and A m i , the co
ordinator of Volunteers Day.
In 'Volunteers Day' the volunteers have to
s h o w the k i b b u t z n i k s s o m e t h i n g of their
culture. All the other national contingents
diligently prepare a piece, the English do
nothing. This it is asserted is typically English.
W h y a r e the other nationalities enthusiastic to
display their country's culture? A r e they well
educated a n d always consulted at e v e r y stage
of the decision-making process? A r e they
happy members of a classless society? N o ,
they a r e m e r e l y u s e d as b a c k g r o u n d to
highlight the apathy of the English.
Their attitude is compared to that of the
tireless kibbutzniks living in a socialist U t o p i a .
This is due n o t to the merits of the system, b u t
the merits of the kibbutz. It is an isolated
microcosm, insensitive to the demands of
central government. T h e Israel of Tel Aviv,
free from Zionistic z e a l a n d the p i o n e e r spirit
• is just a s corrupt and insensitive as any other
c o u n t r y with the additional burden of h i g h
t a x a t i o n and galloping inflation.
In the k i b b u t z they t a k e turns. However,
their s o c i e t y is one of stability. This stability is
e n f o r c e d as a m e a n s of survival, against t h e
d e s e r t , a n d against the Arabs who's desert it
u s e d to be. A n y o n e w h o doesn't fit is thrown
out.
If o n e leaves aside the rather pretentious
e x a m i n a t i o n of class struggle a n d systems of
g o v e r n m e n t , o n e is left w i t h s o m e g o o d
dialogue, w i t h a stylish performance by Philip
D a v i e s as the college dropout. H e is rarely off-
stage, w h i c h is p r o b a b l y just as well. There is a
g o o d c a m e o p e r f o r m a n c e by Leslee Udwin.

disdainful of all other lifestyles. W r o n q is not a

Family films are all to rare nowadays and this version of Alex
Raymond's serial Flash Gordon must certainly rank as one of the most
widely appealing ever. Despite a myriad of shortcomings it is,
nonetheless, entertaining.
The opening sequence shows the fingers of an evil figure passing over
several buttons on a monitor which shows the planet Earth. He chuckles
deeply and presses "Earthquake", then "Hot Hail", and so on. This
figure, for better or worse, is Ming the Merciless, evil ruler of the planet
Mongo using a power beam so that the Earth will be destroyed in no time
Needless to say football hero F l a s h
Gordon and his latest aquaintance Dale
Arden crashland into the house of crazed
ex-NASA scientist Hans Zarkov, who is the
only person who has spotted this bit of
trouble and has a handy spaceship lying
around. If that sounds improbable, then wait
there is more. Zarkov draws a gun on his lab
assistant-"I need help to take off", he says.
"Just grab your toothbrush and a few things."
The assistant flees, but Flash and Dale replace
him with the necessary aid. "Keep your foot on
that big red pedal," Zarkov bleats on lift-off.
Their destination is Mongo, where Ming and
his thugs have a reign of tyranny over several
kingdoms; the cold world Frigia, the forest
kingdom of Arboria, the Hawken's sky city and
so on. As is expected, Flash manages to enlist
the aid of Prince Barin of Arboria and Vultan
(Brian Blessed), leader of the Hawkmen, to
defeat Ming. He also manages to escape
certain death at least five times and have a bit
on the side with Ming's daughter Aura — all
within about twelve hours. Some man.
Producer Dino de Laurentis has obviously
chosen this to b e a homage to the original film
serial, started in 1936. I must admit to being a
keen special effects fan and, quite frankly, in
this case they are abysmal; spaceships become
transparent (revealing some of the beautifully
coloured skys* and the models used are in
parallel with t h e 1936 version. The Hawkmen's
wings flap pathetically and perspectives are
lost all over the place. Worst of all Ming's city
resembles 5. model kit spilled onto the floor
and Vultan's sky city is laughably plastic.
However, despite this, the mixture of bright
colours and alien designs is somehow in
character. After all Raymond's strip never
looked convincing, merely exciting and
imaginative.
The acting,, again, is laughable at times —
Sam Jones stars as the ail-American hero and
barely rises to mediocrity, Melody Anderson's
Dale is only a little better and Topol plays it all
the way for laughs as Zarkov. The only striking
piece is from Max von Sydow who is a truly
detestable Ming. As an aside the screenplay is
by Lorenzo Semple Jr, who scripted the
Batman series and movie, which may explain
many of the hilarious lines mouthed by the
Flash and Dale in particular (the dynamic
duo?).
As to the irreverand, tongue-in-cheek style I
can only say that hardened SF fans will
probably cringe, but most people will reel with
laughter at patches of awfulness. My greatest
worry is that Dr Who did many similar things
long ago and at a fraction of the cost. I also
hope that I am right in thinking that the film
was made like this deliberately.
