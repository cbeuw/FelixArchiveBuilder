FELIX Puzzles Editor, Scaramouche, was today saved from his second embarrassment
in three weeks when i n the early hours of this moiming, an error was discovered i n one
of his Christmas puzzles only hours before FELIX was due to be distributed.
The error occurred i n the puzzle "Silent Audit" i n which the amount of change
handed to the monks should be £ 1 - 6 5 ' and not £ 1 - 6 6 as printed. Anyone attempting the pttzzle
should take note of this correction.
When asked for his comment, Scaramouche said, " I don't know what, to do. I think
1*11 reslgra".
The Editor and Staff of the colour supplement wish everyone a very
Happy Christmas and good luck i n 1981
A very Happy Birthday i s also wished to Mr. Steve Marshall, Editor of the
awfully dull monochrome FELIX.
