College aware that Princess Anne

Dear Sir
I feel obliged to reply to Miss
Snee's letter that appeared in last
week's F E L I X . Perhaps as Miss
Snee is "responsible for the
supervision of the resources of the
Union" she should realise that in
the case of Canoe Club these
resources are inadequate. Par-
ticularly as the Club would be
unable to maintain its present
level of activities without using
members equipment. If the
Union had the money available
to cater for all of Canoe Club's
needs, I am sure that members
would be delighted at not having
to bring their canoes down to
College. Meanwhile, perhaps the
Union should be grateful that
these people supplement the
Club's equipment rather than
taking Miss Snee's attitude which
seems to be that they are abusing
Union facilities.
I would also like to point out to
Miss Snee that Canoe C l u b
members do not fraudulently
include their canoes on the
Union policy.
Tours faithfully

Dear Sir
I must protest most strongly
about K M Freidman's letter in
F E L I X recently. Whilst his
personal preferences among
i members of the Exec can be left
aside, I still think he was wrong
to criticise Rae Snee in those
terms without knowing the full
facts.
R a e Snee borrowed some
Canoe Club equipment, as she is
entitled to, and took some Sailing
Club equipment as well. There
were some life jackets which she
reallocated to the R C S Exec in
case they needed them. She
didn't realise these were faulty
life jackets. Wouldn't it have
been a pity if the R C S Exec had
sunk — and not resurfaced.
His remarks about Liz Lindsay
show him to be a very odious
person. He complains about her
not being attacked often enough
in F E L I X suggesting this is the
result of some Editorial affection
towards her. It is because she has
not done anything to be attacked
on, in fact she has not done
anything. I hope this will be
corrected next term.

Dear Sir,
1 am sorry about this letter,
it's all my responsibility.
T h e present campaign of
apologising at IC is disgraceful.
Firstly we had John T admit it
wasall my responsibility'Passmore
conceding that he was totally to
blame for the No Dice concert
flop. This confounded most of
those at the U G M , so that he was
not asked to make a report to
attempt to assure that it would
not happen in future years.
F E L I X reported that he had
frustrated the best laid plans of
those who wished to see a
sabbatical officer take some real
responsibility for their actions.
A similar case is that which
concerns Ms Snee. Alter she
broke into the Canoe Club store
and stole some of theirequipment,
a U G M motion asking her to
apologise was sent in. Before the
U G M she wrote a letter apolo-
gising. She claimed she "borrowed
the equipment lor someone I
knew to be responsible". She now
says that as Deputy President, she
cantakeanyclub'sequipment,and
presumably do what she likes
with it. W h o pays lor any
damage? It would seem to be
only fair that il any club's
equipment has to be repaired
after she has borrowed it, she
should pay lor it herself. This
matter also raises the point, can
she take equipment, even if the
club concerned doesn't want her
to? The slimy way in which Ms
Snee has behaved does not
endear her to me.
Perhaps M r Marshall does an
honourable thing when he is
asked to apologise. Instead of
apologising he tries to make I he-
situation worse. On reflection, I
think he is the only other noble
and upright person at IC (the
lirst is myseli). In fact I would
certainly give him my support —
should he need one.

Dear Steve
With reference to the recent
U G M concerning Dare Afolabi
and F E L I X . Being one of the
many students at IC who does
not comprehend the workings of
an U G M , I feel it necessary to
write to F E L I X expressing the
views of, I suspect, many persons
at IC.
1. People find the contents of
F E L I X , in general, interesting
and amusing.
2. Most people, including I
suspect Dare Afolabi, find it
amusing to see how many names
beginning with the letter 'D' that
Steve Marshall can think of, or
indeed get into one sentence.
3. It is entirely up to the
Editor as to the exact content of
F E L I X , this includes any editing
as he sees suitable.
4. T h e E d i t o r should be
specifically barred from inclu-
ding any material which by its
nature is liable to cause racial or
sexual tension.
In summary, I feel we should
require a full and complete
apology from M r Marshall for his
inclusion of certain material in
F E L I X 566 and in return offer a
complete vote of confidence in
him as F E L I X Editor . . . and let
the matter be ended.

Dear Mr Marshall •
Your methods of distortion
and manipulation of information
(which is what every non-fascist
who attended the College U G M
of December 2, 1980 will agree is
your definition of " e d i t i n g " )
would certainly have filled Adolf
Hitler's propaganda coordinators
with envy. Carry on editing "for
the neighbourhood".

Section 2.1 of the F E L I X
Constitution states: "The object
of the paper shall be to commu-
nicate the views and opinions of
students at IC (in terms of
decisions taken at UGMs . . .) to its
readers". It appears from last
week's F E L I X as if no decisions
were taken at the U G M concern-
ing the motion on the F E L I X
Editor, since none was "commu-
nicated" to the readers by your
report. If decisions were indeed
taken on the motion, may we
know why you did not inform us
of them?

Dear Sir
Your current campaign against
M r Mooney is disgraceful.
You obviously think it is in
good taste to malign the character
of this much loved man by
printing opinions abut him that
have no basis in fact. As an
example of this, he was called
"the most hated man at I C " ;
whereas everyone knows that
Capt Lindley is the most hated
man at IC.
Despite the fact that he has
been in the catering trade for
thirty-two years, you seem to
believe that he can't run the
kitchens properly or produce
excellent food. This is rubbish,
his food is so good, that even the
Press Secretary of the Duke of
Edinburgh Award Scheme said
the food was "excellent" and
offered her congratulations to
College on having such a superb
caterer. Yes, Mooney food is
truly lit for a king.
Instead of congratulating him,
you continually print BB Wolfle's
actionable comments about he
perils of eating 'Mooney'. Do you
imagine that if students don't like
M r Mooney's tasty and nourish-
ing food, then they can't cook lor
themselves.
To cap it all you printed that
interview in which it was alleged
by M r Mooney that the kitchens
and bars were fumigated weekly,
the staff are bad, he is fat, food is
heated up and kept from lunch-
times to evenings, and there are
odd dishes that they fall down on.
Whilst it is well known that all
the above arc true, il is surely in
the worst tradition ol sensational
journalism to print them.

Stop attacking Union Officers in
