IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 11 May 1972 No. 311
SHEPPARD
RESIGNS?"
PRES. ELECT WITHDRAWS
FROM CIV ENG. EXAMS
After the dizzy heights of the recent elections and sweeping general-
isations characteristic of them we are suddenly reminded that even
the president of the Union has to pass exams!
In fact, it has become
apparent that the college
authorities had not thought
of this either and so we
are (or rather Chris Shep-
pard is) faced with an
interesting situation. The
Union constitution is more
than vague over this point.
This is hardly surprising
since there have only been
three sabbatical presidents
up to date, none of these
being undergraduates at
their time of office.
The problem has been
lurking around for quite
some time and now we
have come face to face
with it. Is it right for the
Union to give its officers
immunity from examina-
tions? The motion which is
to be put at today's Union
Meeting could b e inter-
preted in this way.
"I.C.U. believes that
t h e President-elect
should be allowed to
take office regardless of
his performance in any
examination subsequent
to his election."
However, I think this
would be a wrong conclu-
sion. There is no reason
why a Union official should
be officially registered on
a course while serving his
term of office. A s long as
he has the interest of the
Union members at heart
then he should be recog-
nised by the College.
In the letter which fol-
lows, all this is explained
in detail (it has been edi-
ted). It is vital that full
support be given to the
motion at today's Union
Meeting otherwise the
Union is faced with another
re-election.
Today's vote is effec-
tively a vote of confidence
in your choice of Presi-
dent.

Dear Professor Skempton,
After a considerable amount
of thought regarding my present
situation in the Civil Engineering
Department I have decided to
withdraw from the forthcoming
examinations. This has not been
an easy decision to make but I
am now sure that it is the only
satisfactory one. In reaching it
I have tried to take into ac-
count as many of the influenc-
ing factors, both personal and
otherwise, as I am able. I do,
however, find it impossible to
rationalise some of these factors
and it is this that has made the
final decision so difficult to
make.
My original choice of civil en-
gineering was made without any
difficulty at the age of fifteen.
By that time I had shown some
aptitude for things practical; my
somewhat greater ability at
science and mathematics had
been fostered at the expense of
any literary interest, and my
teachers explained in their re-
ports that I exhibited a certain
quality ot "leadership". The
simple analysis of civil engin-
eering as a blend of techno-
logical and creative ability, to-
gether with its social relevance,
and, when concerned with con-
tracting, its reliance on good
human relations, altogether pre-
sented a too ideally attractive
proposition. My decision was not
reached by an appraisal of a
selection of alternatives, but by
being provided with someone
else's evaluation of my vocation-
al potential, together with the
corresponding and suitably at-
tractive career choice.
On arriving at college and
entering the Department I was
still very much subject to the
somewhat romantic idea of be-
coming a civil engineer. My
commitment in emotional terms
was almost complete, and this
together with my good A levels
constituted what I suppose was
excellent honours degree mater-
ial. I was however, conscious of
the idealism inherent in my
choice and was very concerned
with finding some justification
for it in the course. Thus I be-
gan my time here at I.C. deliber-
ately looking for a correlation
between what I was studying,
the way I was studying it, and
what I perceived as the aims,
objects and responsibilities of
civil engineering as a profes-
sion. In that search I was frus-
trated. I was disillusioned by
the seemingly abstract course
content, by the lack of them-
atic continuity, and by the im-
personal nature of staff/student
relations. I was also disappoint-
ed by the Jack ot community life
at the College and by its gen-
eral insularity in both social and
academic terms.
The result of this dissatisfac-
tion was for me to make the
College as small a part of my
life as possible, doing an abso-
lute minimum of work, and seek-
ing elsewhere those things which
I had previously imagined to be
an integral part of university
life but which I was unable to
find at I.C.
My decision to return into the
second year was based on the
condition that I would assume
a quite different approach to the
College, the Department and the
Course. That I have done. From
the start of the session I have
attempted to investigate many
aspects of the student's lot here
at I.C. Where I have found an-
omalies or deficiences, points
of difference or a lack of under-
standing, I have attempted to
work constructively, both per-
siiii-
.4k
sonally and through my involve-
ment in the Union, to correct
them. This has applied particu-
larly to my course where I first
attempted to discover some in-
trinsic interest, and then to
appoach it purely as an intel-
lectual exercise. I failed in both.
I have come to realise that
the course here is doing nothing
to further my development in
any sense of the word. On the
contrary it is, in many respects,
conflicting directly with some of
my most deeply felt ideals and
aspirations, and far from stimu-
lating any truly creative res-
ponse, is only limiting my realm
of experience to the detriment
of my "education".
I am firmly committed to the
concept of a system of educa-
tion that can be variable in con-
tent and approach, and which
is not constrained by the inade-
quacies of selection, by the rigid
division of disciplines, or by the
emphasis on examination results
as a criterion of success. I am,
therefore, the product of a
vastly different system of educa-
tion whose values have been
predominate in my upbringing
and the etlects of which, al-
though I may be conscious of,
I am unable to neglect. To
weigh my desire for self-deter-
mination against an awareness
of the aspirations of a family
I love is indeed a difficult thing
to do.
My final decision to withdraw
from the examinations results, I
hope, from a certain degree of
mutual respect between myself
and the department. It has never
been denied that the Department
is happiest with students who
are completely committed to a
career in civil engineering, and
who in return for a degree of
the indisputable repute which
the College awards, are prepar-
ed to accept the way in which
the Department chooses to con-
duct its affairs, whether they
are likeable or not. The Depart-
ment also hopes that its stud-
ents, far from regarding the
course as a means to an end,
are attempting to grasp a real
understanding ot the subject
and are prepared to subordin-
ate themselves to that aim. In
short, the staff of the depart-
ment expect of the students a
devotion to the subject of the
sort they themselves feel. That
is an expectation which I re-
spect.
It remains, however, that I do
not present such ideal material,
a fact which both the Depart-
ment and I have been aware of
for some time. For me to sit the
forthcoming examinations would
do nothing to enhance my prin-
ciples nor, I believe, those of
the Department. I now feel that
the best way to realise a mutual
acceptance of my total incompet-
ability with the course is tor me
to withdraw from that part which
formally epitomises it.
The reason for me publicising
my intention to withdraw from
the examinations is because of
the way in which it relates to my
being President-elect of the Un-
ion. While I regard both the cri-
teria and the results of an
examination in civil engineering
as distinctly separate from those
for the election of President of
the Union, I do realize that nei-
ther the College or the Union is
clear about this in terms of pol-
icy. For that reason I intend
firstly to put the question to a
Union meeting and if their sup-
port is forthcoming to proceed
to the College for their decision.
In the event of the Union not
wishing to support me I shall
resign.
Yours sincerely,
Chris Sheppard.

A questionnaire has
been sent round to the
residents of Beit to find
out their reactions to a pos-
sible room-by-room mixing
of the sexes both in the
Old and New hostels. The
mixing would be engineer-
ed to have about half men
and half women on any
floor, mixed randomly. The
bath and toilet areas would
be open to use for both
sexes.
This would, we feel, lead
to better mixing of the
sexes and bring the sex-
ual differences into per-
spective. People at the
moment see the opposite
sex too much as sexual
objects, and not enough
as human beings first and
foremost. The only kind of
relationship with the oppo-
site sex that is possible,
they imagine, is a sexual
one — the idea of a pla-
tonic relationship does not
occur. Thus one would get
a more balanced, mature
outlook on both sides, and
a generally more relaxed
atmosphere.
The mixing of the bath
and toilet areas is primar-
ily a matter of convenience
—any embarrassment felt
at first would quickly dis-
appear.
Some structural altera-
tions would have to be
be made but these were in
the pipeline anyway: e.g.
shower doors, not curtains;
improvement of kitchen
facilities in Old Beit, etc.
The analysis of the ques-
tionnaire will be put before
the Beit hall residents'
committee on May 22nd
and they will decide whe-
ther to implement the sug-
gested system, which if
they agree, could easily be
in operation for October
1972.
