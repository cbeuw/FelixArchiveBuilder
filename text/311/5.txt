A\ PERSONAL VIEW
The many inadequacies of pre-university education
provide us with a predictable stereotype Imperial Col-
lege fresher. One who has been subjected to an aca-
demically biased and intellectually very narrow course
of study since the age of fifteen, at which time that vital
decision was unlikely to have been entirely his own.
In general he has had no reason to question the nature
or direction of his education, or the way in which that
education affects his non-academic development. His
scrutiny of University options would probably have been
far from critical and his final choice of Imperial College
would undoubtedly have been based on its reputation,
which in the eyes of most headmasters serves to nullify
any possible disadvantages.
What are the disadvan-
tages? They lie mainly in
the failure of the College
to either recognize or ac-
cept its responsibility to
students as individuals.
The sort of person who
finds his way into I.C. is
just the person who needs
more from a university
education that a narrow
course of study, with a
very high work load, in an
environment that is soci-
ally inadequate and intel-
lectually uninspiring, and
in an atmosphere that is
potentially extremely op-
pressive.
On arriving at Imperial
College the fresher finds
himself part of a very small
social group, a member of
his year of his department,
part of system that is so
structured that there is a
minimal amount of contact
with other groups. Barriers
exist between depart-
ments, between years
within departments, be-
tween undergraduates and
postgraduates, and be-
tween staff and students.
Even within the confines
of the College and its al-
ready narrow influence the
individual is still further
isolated from any diversity
of stimulation, intellectual
or otherwise.
The College will argue
that it is up to the initia-
tive of each individual stu-
dent to pursue such alter-
native activities as he may
desire in the friendly, you-
can - get - it - if - you-really-
want-it community that is
Central London. Can they
be so naive? Do they really
imagine that someone
who has to commute daily
from his bedsit in Wimble-
don, and who knows no
better from school than to
go home and do his
'homework' in the even-
ings, wil go out into the big
city in search of cultural
or intellectual fulflment?
The average I.C. student
in that position is too con-
cerned with trying to sort
himself out a passable
social life to even think
about it.
The College insists that
placing the burden on the
individual is all part of the
'challenge' of university
life, vital to a process of
character building and es-
sential in producing the
sort of good moral fibre
that industry demands of
its young employees. It
assumes that secondary
education has been suc-
cessful in producing an
annual supply of eight hun-
dred well balanced indivi-
duals who are both intel-
lectually and socially ac-
complished and have
come to the College com-
mitted to three years hard
work towards a well
chosen and well defined
goal, and consequently
will neither need nor ask
more of the college than
access to its specialised
teaching a n d research
facilities and a successful
passage through its exam-
ination machinery. That is
the only sort of student
that I.C. really caters for,
and if the College truly be-
lieves that the majority of
its students represent such
ideal material for their
concept of a university
education (or is it just an
industrial t r a i n i n g
ground?) then they must
be shown otherwise. Any
individual has the right to
an education that caters
for his own needs and not
just the needs of external
industrial interests. That is
a right which can and must
be exercised.

Self:
Hiding behind the scenes.
Invisibly trying to make an impression.
Words: Songs : Music : Communication breakdown?
Sometimes, living in a vacuum —
Nobody knows where I am,
Who I am,
What I want.
What do I want?
Questions : Who is asking, who is answering?
People everywhere — hiding?
Where are they?
Very difficult to find them,
And once found,
To communicate with them.
Fences : Walls : — where is the door,
What is the key?
Just talk — smile laugh TOGETHER.
— that's a nice word .—
Let's use it, and make it work.
COME SUMMER
CRUISING
The cruising section of Imperial College Sailing Club
is now breaking away to form a Yachting Club, to sep-
arate the dinghy fanatics from "Ichthyosaurus", the 27
foot, 5 berth, Folkdancer Class yacht owned by I.C.
In recent years "Icky" has visited France, The Channel
and Scilly Islands, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Den-
mark and Sweden, as well as many pub-to-pub weekend
cruises around the coast.
This year started well for "Icky" with a splendid win-
ter refit and consequently she is sailing very well in-
deed. Over the Easter vac. she was chartered for 4
weekly cruises, and visited Belgium, France and the
Channel Islands.
From the 9th—16th April, Peter Banbury, Tony At-
kins, and Sandy Ealing sailed from Dover to the
Hamble, and although storm bound for a couple of days
managed some very fast sailing in a Force 6, along the
south coast. Over the next eight days, Icky was sailed
by Peter Banbury, Malcolm McVean, Bob Cranmer-
Brown, Dave Hobman and brave Christine Fisher. The
126 mile trip from the Isle of Wight to Guernsey in a
brisk N E wind took 24 hours, and on arrival we were
all entertained very well at the Royal Channel Islands
Yacht Club, where lager was cheap at 7£p and the
showers unbelievably welcome. From St. Peterport in
Guernsey we sailed to St. Malo in a record 9 hrs., aver-
aging 6.4 knots in a Force 5—7, with some dramatic
navigation through a 200 yard wide channel in the
rocks, at the entrance to St. Malo harbour. The return
trip to Guernsey against the wind took a hard 18 hours
and from 3—5.00 a.m. saw some brave sail changing
on a plunging foredeck by a wet and exhausted crew.
Eventually we left Icky in Guernsey, having heard a
series of Gale Force warnings from the NE—for those
worried about it, "Icky" has weathered several Force 8
Gales, but it's just not possible to sail to windward in
a Gale!
Over the summer, there will be a number of sailing
weekends, and several cruises lasting from one to five
weeks—the latter as a charter to Spain and back! At
£40 per week for 5 people, this is a very cheap way to
spend an exciting holiday. If you'd like to come along
for a weekend or a week, contact Bob Cranmer-Brown,
Chem. Eng. P.B., I.C., 01-589-5111, extension 1964, or
phone 994-4788 evenings.
