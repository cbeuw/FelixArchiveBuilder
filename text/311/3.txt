EDITORIAL
I can think of no better place to comment on
the events of the past year than from the last
edition of Felix this session.
FELIX
Perhaps this edition is even more important
because there is no doubt in my mind that Felix
will turn into a "real" newspaper, able to carry
news and information produced on a weekly
basis by a full time sabbatical editor. Undoubt-
edly next year will see a Union free from com-
munication wrangles, a union where participa-
tion and involvement become the rule rather
than the exception.
ELECTIONS (or if at first you don't succeed)
I cannot help but comment on the situation
whereby one person was able to successfully
challenge the election of Honorary Secretary
and force the union quite rightly into re-open-
ing and re-holding of that election. It was
obvious to every member of the executive that
the Imperial College constitution was pathetic-
ally weak and it is with regret that there has
never been time enough for John McCullough's
constitutional changes to be discussed. I don't
know whether to treat the uncontested re-elec-
tion with grateful thanks to the three defeated
candidates who stood down or with disappoint-
ment because they had not fought on! One thing
is certain, the road has been opened to anyone
whether they are merely seeking justice or
whether they only seek trouble and confusion,
to bring the union to a halt.
ACCOMMODATION
Finally I think we must be grateful that this
year has not seen the situation whereby hun-
dreds of IC students have been homeless. I feel
that now is the time for consolidation in housing
rather than advancement. A start was made in
October when twenty-four women were moved
into Selkirk—now they must be integrated
with the rest of the residents, not isolated at the
top of staircase 8.
Beit Hall too, should scatter it's women's
rooms amongst the men's and hopefully try and
attain an atmosphere of understanding be-
tween the sexes. The union has its part to play,
and could start well by reducing the number of
Union Officials' places thus allowing more ord-
inary IC students the opportunity of at least
one year's residence.

Black Thoughts
Dear Sir,
I would like to bring to the attention of your readers
the forthcoming election for the Sabbatical position of
Hon. Secretary of IC Union; this election is equally im-
portant as the previous, aborted attempt and, as such,
I hope that Union members will spare a little of their
valuable time to ensure that the democratic process
prevails over the bureaucratic. (bureaucrat, (byoo'rok'-
krat) n. Official who works (?) according to a fixed
routine without exercising intelligent').
The STV system as used by IC Union is nothing more
than a sophisticated form of constitutional castration.
It is a sad and sorry indictment of our Union that the
negligent transactions, or perhaps the administrative
incompetence of a few can thwart the will of the major-
ity. I sincerely hope that the Union Members will feel
moved to mandate me to extricate the executive, and
the Union, from its aimless perfunctory writings.
My aim is to revitalize the enthusiasm of the average
union member,—a goal which can only be achieved by
a person who is both approachable and informative;
somebody who union members can meet for a chat, who
will fully account the executives' action through the
media of a weekly Felix and prominently placed notice
boards.
Union General Meetings have sunk into a morass of
petty bureaucracy; many union members with construc-
tive ideas to contribute at meetings are befuddled by the
procedural techniques used by both chairmen to rail-
road official motions through, and by factions who have
a bare-faced disregard for the feelings of the muffled
majority. These monstrous political methods born out
of dishonour and deceit, are an infringment of one's dis-
cussion. The Union's Blue Book (which this year car-
ried a red cover!) should contain standing orders;
formal business at UGM's must be sped up so that
everybody is able to take part in debate.
I am not a person who sits in an ivory tower immune
from current events, I have the ability to get things done,
I am an eminently suitable man for the job.
I remain, Sir,
the Union's servant,
Martin C. Black.
More Elections
Dear Editor,
For once I'm not wasting space in your admirable
publication by talking about general apathy in IC for
ICU. That would be a waste of time! What has disgusted
me—even in this cynical state—is the general level of
actual disinterest from those who actually attend ICU
meetings and appear concerned.
I think the last straw was the election of Student
Residence Officer (and one or two others) last term.
Having made a specific point of information regarding
abstentions at the Union meeting in question, I was not
surprised to see so many abstentions (20 per cent) for
SRO compared with about 40 each for the remainder.
Final figures were:
Winning Candidate ... 183
Other * 143
Abstentions ... 82
Papers 7
Total 415
You don't need a Mathematics Degree (sic) to see
that the winner didn't have a 50 per cent majority do
you? And you should not need reminding of an analog-
ous example either!
This raises a number of questions:
(a) Why so many abstentions?
Why accepted?
Why not challenged anyway?
Why am I bothered?
Alternatives?
What is worse?

Well I
be due to either voters being unable to choose between
apparently equal candidates and/or dissatisfaction
with both candidates.
I understand the winning candidate was considered
elected on the basis that the election was not true STV
(which it certainly wasn't).
Anyway there were 80 people that abstained and since
there could be a valid questioning of the election why
did no-one challenge? (You still can!). I nearly did. I
wrote a letter and delivered it but then withdrew it.

Black
Hatred
Dear Editor,
On reading M.C.B.'s let-
ter my Super cultural mind
sprang immediately to
Shakespeare; "It is a tale
told by an idiot, Full of
sound and fury signifying
nothing".
The pompous and
pedantic ramblings con-
tain within it maintain
the standards that we have
all come to expect from
M.C.B. (It's easy to guess
what the C stands for).
This pomposity in my opin-
ion would serve to alienate
the ordinary members of
the Union whom he is pre-
tending to want to draw
into the mainstream of
union life.
All would be union exe-
cutives make the predict-
able point of stating their
vehement dislike of bur-
eacracy, M.C. . . . B. is no
exception. He promises us
the ultimate in Student
Unions; a streamlined Cor-
poration over which he
would pontificate and en-
act his fantasies of being a
big business entrepreneur,
quite a frightening thought.
What this organisation, run
by Zurich type gnomes
headed by M.C. . . . B.,
wohld do nobody knows,
for he appears to be de-
void of ideas and only
interested in strutting
round insisting how ap-
proachable (sick) and
representative of the silent
majority (sic) he is.
M.C. . . . B.'s bitter criti-
cism of the S.T.V. voting
system is so vivid I can
only assume that he has
had previous experience
of castration. I leave it to
the readers to decide
which form.
