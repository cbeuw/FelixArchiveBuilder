CONFERENCE
AT THE
CROSSROADS
This year's Birmingham Conference of the National
Union of Students will be remembered in NUS history
as the conference of the LCDSU—the "Liaison Com-
mittee for the Defence of Student Unions." The Liaison
Committee say that they were formed firstly to "win the
NUS to its policy on the question of Student Union
Autonomy and secondly to draw together all those
unions and groups of militants in the ongoing fight
against the state's attack in education and the other
central political issues of the day." They formed up at
the November Margate conference, Piers Corbyn be-
ing a founder member. This Birmingham conference
may yet turn out to be the first of a series of such
LCDSU-dominated conferences. It is to be hoped that
they will not do further irreparable damage to the repu-
tation of the NUS.
The LCDSU succeeded not
only in pressing their point with
great forcefulness, but also
proved to delegates, onlookers,
readers of the popular dailies
and the tax-paying public alike
that NUS conferences can be
the biggest farce around—one
day Lew Grade will televise it
as a never-ending, self-perpetu-
ating series. For that's just what
it is. I know that this is only my
second conference, but as I
once again witnessed the resur-
rection of Autonomy and Ulster
and the birth of Women's Lib
as a new topic for the book, I
felt as though I had been sitting
in that conference hall all my
life.
Perhaps the most intriguing
thing to a layman and non-par-
ticipant like myself is the seri-
ousness with which the pro-
ceedings are taken by the dele-
gates, even (or perhaps I
should say especially) by the
members of the LCDSU. I firmly
believe, unlike some of my
student press colleagues, that
the organisers of this faction
have only the good of Student
Unions in their minds, and had
no intention of directly making
a laughing-stock of conference.
As I saw a Liaison Committee
member get up to every motion
and propose an amendment ex-
pressing their basic principles,
these manifestly being that
everything that's wrong with the
world is the product of Imper-
ialism, Capitalism, Toryism, and,
more generally, Ted Heath, I
realised suddenly "God! They
really do expect conference to
take them seriously!" . . . though
I did find it very difficult to
conceive that if one overthrew
capitalism pollution and over-
population would be instantly
cured, which is what they seem-
ed to be implying at one stage.
Their beliefs are quite possibly
correct—but, having heard them
churn up the same argument
for the same amendment to
every single motion that came
up before conference over those
five long days, one sympa-
thises with conference for being
disillusioned and defeating them
every time. At one stage I felt
like dashing out and joining the
Consevative Party. (You'll pro-
bably be pleased to hear that,
on reflection, sense prevailed
and I didn't).
And now, having bored you
stiff with my personal views on
conference, and before launch-
ing into a mammoth resume of
what really happened motions-
wise (yes, the TRUE unexpur-
gated facts as only FELIX can
tell them!!) you will be treated
to a brief bit of chit-chat about
the IC delegation and weather.
The latter, which is really
what you wanted to know about
anyway, was pretty terrible (NO,
I'm talking about the weather,
not the IC delegation!!!). Come
to think of it, it was pretty ter-
rible at Margate last November
too. Must be something about
the weather in the constitution
(GET ON WITH IT!!—we didn't
pay for you to go so that you
could write 2,000 words on the
weather—Ed). The Imperial
delegation consisted of John
McCullough, Dave Hobman, Rob
Armitage, Chris Sheppard, Piers
Corbyn and Pete Ransome. If it
strikes you that the last two were
the two NOT to be elected to
go, you'd be right . . . . but
Dave Amos and John Murlis had
to drop out at short notice, and
so Piers and Pete agreed to
come with observer status. And
so the intrepid six, together
with passengers, duplicator, 30
reams of paper, 'n suitcases and
yours truly, your very own pet
(Miaaooouuu!) reporter, crowd-
ed into the RCC Transit at 1100
hrs. on Monday, 10th April and
proceeded at breakneck speed
up the Edgware Road and
thence up the M1 to beautiful
Birmingham. Then, feeling suit-
ably elevated by a 70-minute
wait in the registration queue
and having moved my luggage
half a mile on foot to another
hall of residence and subse-
quently discovered that the
walk from the conference hall
to the hall of residence where
i was staying was in the region
of a mile or more (needless to
say, with their delicate consti-
tutions, the delegation travel-
led the distance by van), I en-
thusiastically entered the con-
ference hall in anticipation of
Turn left,
•
left, then
left again
another thrilling opening speech
from who is without doubt the
worst speaker in conference—
our pressy himself, the Rt.
Dishon. Digby Jacks.
But now to serious matters:
i.e., the motions that were vari-
ously passed and defeated (or
at least the important ones):—
AUTONOMY was by far the
longest debate, lasting for a
good eight hours in toto, in bits
and pieces between 9 a.m. and
1 a.m. the following morning.
Surprisingly perhaps to those
uninitiated in conference, little
if anything new was raised, and
the majority of the time was
spent counting and recounting
the four or five card votes that
were demanded by the LCDSU.
(For those who do not know, a
card vote is one where the total
strength of the constituent
unions are counted as votes in
a secret ballot—usually motions
are passed on a show of dele-
gates' cards. The Card Vote
principle tends to favour the
large colleges, invariably univer-
sities and polys; this is because
of the system of allocation of
delegates' cards to small col-
leges). IC (John McC) spoke
on this motion censuring those
CO's who had not yet coughed
up the 1p levy, let alone the 2p
one, levied by last November's
conference and the emergency
conference in January.
WOMEN IN SOCIETY was
without doubt the most interest-
ing motion passed, and perhaps
the most important. Besides out-
lawing strip shows in Student
Unions (which was, naturally,
all the popular dailies reported)
the motion more generally sup-
ported women's right to equal
opportunity and pay, equality in
education, coed schools, more
sex education, free contracep-
tion, and the abolition of single-
sex colleges. Dave Hobman,
famed liberator of the Union
Bar, spoke on behalf of IC for
this motion.
ENVIRONMENT. Conference
accepted that the world was now
in a most dangerous situation
because of pollution and over-
population, and called for a re-
duction in the former and free
contraception to help combat
the latter. An interesting
amendment tabled by the exe-
cutive was that all smoking in
public places should be banned.
Having passed this by an over-
whelming majority, conference
proceeded to totally ignore it
and continued to smoke pro-
fusely. Nor have I noticed ICU
taking any action on this most
thoughtful and sensible amend-
ment by banning smoking in the
Union Building, etc. (Now you
know that I'm a non-smoker!!).
It is making a mockery of con-
ference if CO's take no notice
of the motions they themselves
have passed.
JAMES. Conference totally re-
jected the James Report on
further education as a "total
hotch-potch of ideas" which
would result in "an elitist sys-
tem of Higher Education with an
inferior Teacher Training sec-
tor". Conference called for an
end to the binary system of
financing of further education. It
also called for a "Day of
Action" to protest about James,
Binary, and the government's
attitude to Autonomy.
GRANTS. The Imperial-suppor-
ted amendment extolling the
virtues of and pressing for a
'Student Wage", to be paid to
all students for the duration of
the academic year and without
parental contribution, upon which
income students would pay in-
come Tax and Social Security
payments was passed by a large
majority. The motion also called
for equal "wages" to be paid to
all students irrespective of sex
or the sector of higher ed they
are in.
CONFERENCE REFORM (My
God, does it need it!!). After
miscellaneous suggestions, in-
cluding one that instead of two
conferences a year we have one
8-day one (it was then pointed
out that not everybody was that
suicidally inclined), Conference
set up a working party to look
into the whole set-up. Amongst
things they will look into will be
the election of ail delegates by
union meetings (like the ICU
system, in fact, is at present. . .
many other colleges' delegations
consists of volunteers or co-
opted members, and no election
is held), which would probably
mean that the LCDSU and any
other similar organisation that
might set up would receive less
support, and that Conference
would become more moderate;
they will also consider the
necessity for the mandatement
of delegations by their unions
on important topics prior to con-
ference (which would weaken
splinter groups still further) and
methods of saving conference's
time (very welcome, in view of
the time spent on points of
order and information and in
dragging up every sub-sub-para-
graph of the consitution in every
motion.).
F.E. COLLEGES. This motion
recognised that many FE col-
leges have no facilities what-
soever, and that the others have
very little. The exec was cen-
sured for their lack of leadership
over the binary campaign, and a
move to establish a fund for FE
college unions was referred to
the Finance Committee for its
consideration.
EMERGENCY MOTIONS con-
cerned the campus problems of
several CO's. A motion on Lan-
caster supported the students
there on their action over the
dismissal of Dr. Craig; another
supported the students of
Magee College in Londonderry,
which is threatened with clo-
sure; and yet another expressed
conference's support for Steve
Parry, expelled sabbatical presi-
dent of Brighton College (he has
since been reinstated).
ENTERTAINMENTS. A report
proposing an NUS limited lia-
bility ents brokerage was adop-
ted by a large majority. This will
entail CO's buying shares in
this company and, perhaps,
having a bit of a rough time
ents-wise for at least several
months. The idea is that this
brokerage will be able to book
groups at a lower price than in-
dividual colleges are having to
pay at the moment. However, it
seems likely that the big agen-
cies to whom all the artists are
signed will boycott this broker-
age, and thus their groups will
not appear at colleges.
But the NUS, in its infinite
wisdom, thinks that this situation
will change, in that they depend
so much on the college circuit
that eventually they'll give in and
agree to book groups to us for
a reduced fee. Whether this will
work or not remains to be seen
. . . . on condition that you your-
selves boycott visits to see
groups perform at other venues
than colleges, it might just
work . . .
ELECTIONS is the only thing
left to tell you about. During the
first two days of conference, the
executive for next year was
elected, or, should I say, re-
elected, since it remains virtu-
ally unchanged. Almost every
election was a straight fight be-
tween a retiring exec member
and a candidate put up by the
LCDSU . . . so the "Telegraph"
had to swallow its pride and
socialist tendencies and declare
its relief that a Communist had
won the election to President of
NUS against a Marxist-Trotsky-
ist ultra-left-winger. Needless to
say, the LCDSU lost every elec-
tion, although they consistently
polled a third of all the votes,
and in some cases rather more.
So Digby Jacks is president for
another year. And the rest of the
old regime will continue. At any
rate, for another year. And,
having elected their chosen
executive, conference will pro-
ceed to censure them when-
ever possible at next year's
November and April confer-
ences. When, once again, the
farce will recommence.
Wei, are you still with me?
You're probably the only one!
I'd like to apologise for the
very heavy political content of
this article: although I'm no
politician, since there was no
doubt that the political element
was the most important single
theme of the conference, I felt
it necessary to elaborate on it.
What has the conference
achieved? Well, let's hope that
the Constituent Organisations
will act upon the motions, the
Executive will honour their in-
structions, and that the authori-
ties will consider fully the views
of Conference. Then, perhaps,
conference will achieve far more
than might at first appear.
