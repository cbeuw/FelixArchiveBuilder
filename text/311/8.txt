These were Country
Joe's first words as he
took the stage o n Satur-
day night and the audi-
ence obediently echoed it.
Of course it was a sham
this time—just to test
whether the audience were
eating out of his hand,
which they were. In his
hand he had lots of good-
ies—a very fine show, in
the words of "Entertain-
ment is my Business". The
songs never lost the at-
tention of the audience
whether they were lewd,
like "Movie-Ola" and " O n
notch of your c .",
sad, like "The Ballad of
Jean Duprez", simple opti-
mistic songs like "Free
some d a y " or the acid
(perhaps the wrong word
in County Joe's case)
digs at people in high
places like "Tricky-Dicky
(He's a genuine plastic
man)" for Richard Nixon.
That's the way to sing pro-
test songs, right? A light-
hearted dig, and not a
clumsy pseudo-accusation
associated with groups
like Chicago.
Nearly all the songs,
with the exception of
"Jean Duprez" were short
and to the point and for
this reason there were far
too many to be recorded
in detail. But Country Joe
will always be associated
with anti-war (or at least
anti-draft) songs and he
did of course do "l-Feel-
Like-rm-Fixin'-To-Die-Rag"
complete with " F i s h "
chant, and the other anti-
draft song called "Kiss My
Ass". Before the Viet-
nam Rag he told a long
anecdote of how the police
at Boston forbade the
group to say "it", and his
trial for saying "it" at Woo-
ster, Massachusetts. In his
defence, after having been
asked what the word
" F u c k " had to do with go-
ing to Vietnam, he said
well, when someone gets
a letter in the post saying
he's going to fight in Viet-
nam he'll probably say
"Oh Fuck".
Right On said the audi-
ence and they joined in
with the cheer just like the
crowd at Woodstock. I
wonder how many of them
really had experienced the
draft. Still it's the singer,
not the audience, and Joe
entertained par excel-
lence.
Linda Lewis (again?)
gave an excellent opening
set with some wistful
songs about life and love
and was warmly received
by a surprisingly small
audience.
HIP, HIP, HOORAY!
Yes, another year of boring Presidential waffle is
coming to an end and as it's difficult for me to write
it as it is no doubt for you to read it, I'm sure it's a
reason for pints all round.
In Snapping Jaws I've
tried to implore you to
come to the last couple of
Union Meetings, so I
thought I'd write some-
thing on those projects
that are underway at the
moment and will be hap-
pening before next Octo-
ber.
Besides the develop-
ments with respect to the
2 new bars and the new
lower Refectory in the
Union, there is going to be
a general facelift given to
the Union Building this
summer. Nearly every
room in the Union will be
repainted and the floors
sanded, there will be a re-
vamping of the Concert
Hall Stage, general re-
wiring within the building
and a new Gymnasium (or
at least the old one should
look like that). Plans are
in hand to turn the Room
at the Top (formerly the
Upper Refectory) into an
Information Centre with
Travel and Insurance
there next year, an Office
for the Ents Committee
and Dyelining and Dupli-
cating facilities. Details
are not complete yet, but
if you have any other ideas
of ways to make use of this
unique opportunity or sug-
gestions for paint schemes
etc., then contact me in
the Union Office.
While we're still press-
ing to get a Weekly Felix
with a sabbatical Editor
next year, we are also in-
vestigating to what extent
we should finance the ex-
pansion of STOIC. To that
end I've prepared a survey
on the student TV services
at the moment running in
British Universities — re-
plies are still coming in,
but in talking to a number
of Presidents I've found
that expansion is expen-
sive. However a number
of Colleges, e.g. Brunei
have very effective Cam-
pus Radio operations—
they run for example for
1£ hours per morning and
3 hours per evening, 5
days a week. I hope, dur-
ing this term, to look into
the possibility of ICU start-
ing a campus Radio, next
year. During this term, I
think it has been realised
this year how vital good
communications are to the
well being of the Union
and hopefully these ap-
praisals of the various
Absolutely
the last
President's
Piece
(this year!)
communications media
possible within ICU will
bear fruit in the years to
come.
Another campaign I
hope to wage this Summer
Term is to list the Accom-
modation Bureaux within
the area, and with the aid
of Nick Gregory, The
Union Solicitor, to seek out
those bureaux acting in
contravention of the A c -
commodation Agencies act
and to black them in co-
ordination with the local
Trades Council and at the
same time put pressure on
the Local Council to put
pressure on these agen-
cies.
So we're by no means
slacking now your backs
are turned and you're fac-
ing examination papers—
keep watching Snapping
Jaws (there should be four
more issues left).
Thanks for bearing with
me for so long. Best of
luck with the exams and
have a good Summer!
So you need to
earn a living?
It would be fair to say that most students do not want
to leave college, much preferring the free and easy
way of life. Unfortunately all good things must come to
an end and in one year's time, from which you will
gather this article is aimed at this year's second year,
this will be the case for the majority of you! Is it not a
horrible thought?
One booklet that will
help you is the Main Areas
of Graduate Employment
that can be obtained from
the Careers Office Room
306 College Block. There
is a careers library attach-
ed to this office where a
reference selection of
firms can be viewed.
Why don't you have a
chat with your departmen-
tal careers advisor. Even
better go and talk to the
University of London
Careers Adviser who visits
College Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday each
week. His name is Mr. P.
A. Ashworth and he thrives
on work. He will undoubt-
edly be busy first term next
year s o why not take the
opportunity of his free time
this term and have a chat
with him. A n appointment
can be made with this
gentleman through the
Appointments Office Room
306 College Block.
If you want a job there
is no time to delay!
To those students who
are going to wait for a job
to come to them and to
those students who believe
firms are just tearing their
hair out to employ gradu-
ates I implore them to be
a little more thoughtful in
the dole queue. It has
been proved these past
two years, that if you want
a job you have to
i) know what you want
to do
ii) know where to get
this type of job
iii) work hard to get this
job.
So why not take a
couple of days after your
exams this year and think
about getting a job.
SO WHAT A R E Y O U
GOING TO DO?
If you know what you
want to do, where you can
do it, if you know the Man-
aging Director, and his
son or daughter, do not
worry, you will probably
get a job.
A P P L Y EARLY TO FIRMS!
