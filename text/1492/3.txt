‘Humanities staff’
attack College day
proposals
All four of the officers accused of
assaulting Babar Ahmad in 2003 were
cleared last week at Southwark Crown
Court. Detective Constable John
Donohue said that he was “relieved”
by the jury’s decision. The officers’
solicitor Colin Reynolds said that “they
are hoping to put these unfounded and
unsubstantiated allegations behind
them.”
Recordings from an MI5 bug
planted in the house emerged only
months before the trial began, which
Mr Reynolds said had provided “very
significant evidence” that had “changed
a large number of matters”.
The jury took less than an hour to
find Police Constables Nigel Cowley,
Roderick James-Bowen, Mark Jones,
and Detective Constable John Donohue
not guilty of assault occasioning actual
bodily harm.
Babar Ahmad’s lawyer, Fiona
Murphy, said that the Met Comissioner’s
admission in 2009 that Babar Ahmad
had been subjected to a “serious,
gratuitous and prolonged” attack
during his arrest sat “uncomfortably
with the jury’s verdict.” Babar Ahmad
received £60,000 in damages from the
Metropolitan police after the admission
in 2009.
Babar Ahmad’s father Ashfaq Ahmad
read out a statement on his behalf: “The
Metropolitan Police admitted at the
High Court that I was brutally assaulted
by its officers without resisting arrest.
Today’s verdict means that no police
officer has been held to account for this
abuse.”
On the issue of his extradition, Babar
Ahmad denied any involvement in
terrorist activity and said “as a British
man, I should be given a fair trial in
Ben Scally Britiain, just as these officers have
received.”
Following the jury’s decision, the
judge expressed his hope that Babar
Ahmad detention without charge
would “end as soon as possible”, either
by his extradition to the US, or by his
release.
The findings of a Met review into
the case is expected to be published
soon and a misconduct hearing into the
assault allegations is to be carried out. A
previous Met investigation into the case
resulted in no disciplinary action against
any of the officers.
The Guardian has reported that PCs
Mark Jones and Roderick James-Bowen
“had 40 separate allegations of assault
against them between 1993 and 2007,
the majority involving black or Asian
men.” The allegations were all found to
be unsubstantiated following inquiries,
according to the Met.

Staff from the Humanities Department
have attacked the proposed changes to
the College day, saying that there are
“serious reasons why [the proposals]
will not work” and suggesting that they
marginalise and devalue humanities
courses.
The letter, signed ‘Staff of the
Humanities Department’, argues that
“no other department would schedule
classes at the end of a long and hard
day” and questions whether the
“technical and admininstrative staff”
will be there to support classes later
in the evening. The proposals as they
currently stand would see humanities
courses scheduled from 5–7pm on
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays,
as well as from 12–2pm on Mondays
and Fridays. In addition the proposals
suggest allowing exams to be
scheduled on Saturdays in exceptional
circumstances and reducing the amount
of time allocated for lunch to one hour.
by allowing departments to schedule
classes during the current two-hour
lunch break.
AmemberofstafffromtheHumanities
Department, who wished to remain
anonymous, hand-delivered the letter to
the Felix office on the 2nd of June. The
letter also criticised Felix’s position on
the proposals, voicing concern that Felix
would accept the plan if the details were
worked out satisfactorily. In an editorial
on the 27th of May, Felix argued that
“the proposals [...] are a step in the
right direction” and that if the proposals
provided the appropriate safeguards,
“Felix will support the changes”.
Professor Dorothy Griffiths, who
chairs the College Day Working Group
behind the proposals, said that it was
“premature” to respond to letters as
“we are simply discussing ideas at the
moment.” She said that the “Working
Group recognises and values the role of
Humanities in the College” but added
that the current timetabling issues “need
to be resolved.”
Professor Andrew Warwick, the Head
of the Humanities Department, did not
respond to questions about whether he
supported or was aware of the letter,
or whether he supported the proposed
timetable changes as they currently
stand.

Musharraf
cancels talk
Former Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf has pulled out from a talk
scheduled for this Sunday. The College
had approved the talk, after initially
rejecting an earlier date, but imposed
severe restrictions, including only
allowing College members to attend
and preventing online publicity, except
through Clubs’ member email lists.
Organiser Hussain Ali said that the
restrictions were extreme and that they
would have severely hampered the
potential of the talk if it had gone ahead.
He said that President Musharraf had
been insulted by the restrictions and had
pulled out for that reason.
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
Heather Jones said that she was
disappointed that the talk could not go
ahead, saying that it would have been
“an interesting opportunity for students”
but added that she felt the College were
right to be cautious.
