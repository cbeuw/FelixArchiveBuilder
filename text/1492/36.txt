by a high wall, within which were a
couple of plastic chairs, a work bench
made of nailed-together planks, and
a rusted-up water-pump that had
been rendered obsolete when the
first family to live there had installed
running water.
Inside, the old man pottered around
the kitchen while his wife held a
pince-nez to her eyes and leaned over
a recipe book on the worktop.
“Anything that doesn’t fit in the
freezer will have to go in the fridge
and be eaten in the next week,” she
said.
“We’ll have plenty of room, you see
if we don’t. Did you put the bait away
somewhere, duck?”
“It’s in the biscuit tin on the shelf
by the window. Next to the spice
rack. That’s it.”
“Well what in God’s name did you
put it there for?”
“If you will leave it lying around on
the table, I’ll put it away wherever I
see fit. If you want to know where it
is, then next time you make sure you
tidy it away.”
They argued in the friendly
bantering tones of a couple who’ve
T
he old man walked into the
kitchen, carefully holding his
fishing rod in front of him. He
was manoeuvring it gingerly to
avoid knocking anything off the
cluttered kitchen shelves with the
swaying tip, before finally propping
it against the jamb of the front door.
When she saw him come in, his wife
paused from wiping a damp rag over
the table, and stood back to observe
him, fixing up a few strands of long
hair back into the tight bun they had
escaped from. Like the table, she
was plain and roughly cut, heavy and
sturdy. Her hair was sparse and grey as
iron, contrasting with her husband’s
thatch of downy white hair as her soft
features did with his angular ones.
“Beautiful day, today,” said the old
man in his broad Yorkshire brogue.
“Thought I’d go out and see if I
could catch something.”
“Again? Seems like I saw you going
out with that fishing rod only a few
days ago. There’s still quite a bit of
the last catch left.”
“That were two weeks ago, duck.
Besides, we mayn’t get a day like this
again till next year. Got to make the
most of it while we can.” He turned
and looked out of a window, blinking
at the brightness of the day. If he
expected to see any sign of impending
storms, he was to be disappointed.
It truly was one of those days that
come around only a handful of times
every summer in Yorkshire. A day
with hot sun, dry air, and a slight
cooling breeze. The dales rolled away
into the distance from the cottage,
with the only sounds being the slight
rustling of the grass, and a faint buzz
from cables strung between a line of
pylons that crossed an adjacent field,
vanishing into the distance in opposite
directions. There were a group of
cows on the far side of the field, who
had decided to shelter from the heat
of the day in the shadow of an oak,
chewing cud and lapping water from
a stream. The cows were beef cattle;
white-faced Black Herefords; so the
farmer who owned the fields there
about came only rarely to lead one off
for slaughter.
The cottage had once belonged to
a gamekeeper when the fields were
part of an estate, but the estate’s
grounds had been parcelled off
for farmland fifty years ago to pay
various debts, and as the current
farmer’s father had had no use for
the cottage, it had been sold. First
to a family who were enchanted
by the beauty of the countryside,
but when the enchantment of the
countryside paled in comparison to
the convenience of the city, it had
passed into the hands of the old
man and his wife, for whom the
conveniences of the city had long
since been recognised as unnecessary
nuisances. It would have been lonely
for most, but the old couple had
each other, and they saw no need
for any other regular company. The
cottage itself was a typical affair for
Yorkshire, built of the dun-coloured
chunks of stone that characterise the
housing of that district, two stories
high and roughly cubic in shape,
with a shallowly-sloped slate roof. At
the front of the cottage, a macadam
track led between two fields until it
exited onto an A-road where cars
zipped back and forth, too far away
for any engine noise to disturb the
cottage occupants, and at the back
there was a cobbled yard surrounded
