ASCETIC
Too much time to play the cynic,
Glad to be your biggest critic,
Lacking purpose and direction,
But keen to give all my aﬀection.
I do mean every word I say,
But deﬁnitions change each day,
Calm down dearest, no need to worry,
When Iʼm gone you wonʼt be sorry.
KHAO SAN BLUES
My hands they tremble and they shake,
Deep down inside I feel that ache.
Time to decide a clear conclusion,
Burst that brutal false illusion,
Put an end to my confusion,
This shouldnʼt be the life weʼre choosinʼ.
Cold inside, nothing to hide,
Where the fuckʼs your sense of pride?
TON RAI PLAI DEE
Burst from the womb,
Accepting my doom,
Lay me in my tomb
for the worms to consume.
Beauty reborn,
Iʼm no longer torn,
Sans reason to scorn
and my Mind to adorn.

APRICITY
Finally found myself again and it was all so clear
but Iʼve lost it now so Iʼll sit back down and reignite that fear.
With my face pushed to the ﬂoor Iʼll just try not to care,
Itʼs not a very pretty place this neither here nor there.
MORPHOSIS
Toss aside that little thud
and oh-so petty burns,
Grow or ache be still or shake
and still the world just turns.
Tiny imperfections are
an inconvenient truth,
Preoccupy inquiring mind
or end up through the roof.
A promise is a promise
and I do my best to please,
The Honesty and open arms
we need in times like these.
Satisfaction not despair,
Only by your side mon frere,
Regardless of the passing stare
Just take my hand Iʼll take you there.
