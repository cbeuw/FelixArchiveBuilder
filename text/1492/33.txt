CHILD HO O D
This work is a challenge to conventional
portrayals of childhood. I want to ask
questions about the identity of my subjects,
andtoanalyzetheirpersonalities.Byusingboth
staged and observed portraits, I manipulate
the images in order to achieve paradoxical
character and an interplay between fiction and
reality, suggestions and expectations.
