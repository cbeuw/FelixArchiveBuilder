UNTETHERED
Imagine: a flock of paper birds set free across the gallery,
surging from out of one corner to disappear into another.
Imagine: the tensions in the lines of string fastened to the ceiling,
fixing, imprisoning their subjects.
Imagine: a weightless bird, spinning helplessly on the end
of a line, at once restrained and supported.
If only: the weights were greater, the tensions increased,
then, only then, might these lines
break
