L
ife Sciences Postgradu-
ates are Important! I will
endeavour to provide a
strong, loud voice for all life
sciences postgraduates and en-
sure the welfare of this dynamic
network of scientists!
• REPRESENTATION AND
RESPECT – Life sciences post-
graduates contribute to science,
medicine and humanity as a
whole! Therefore, you DE-
SERVE to have your NEEDS
met by college staff and admin-
istration. If you are unhappy
about your course conditions or
departmental structure, you will
have your OPINIONS heard!
• EQUALITY – All post-
graduates should have EQUAL
RIGHTS on campus! If you
feel that you have been treated
H
i, my name is Aleksan-
dra Turp. I am a second
year PhD student at the
Clinical Sciences Centre located
at the Hammersmith Hospital
Campus. I am running for the po-
sition of Academic and Welfare
Officer for Medicine because I
am passionate about continuing
to improve the standards of the
PG experience in the Faculty.
Why me: In the past year I
have held the position of depart-
mental representative. I raised
the issue of lack of social space
and events on the Hammersmith
campus. I have set up the Stu-
dent Community group in my
department, which has organised
social and academic events both
for my department and campus-
wide. Just recently I have ex-
I
f elected as AWO Medicine
I believe I will bring insight
and a great deal of enthusi-
asm to the role! Having been a
medical student + researcher +
academic tutor myself in Saudi
Arabia and spent two years in
this department (MPH/PhD in
Epidemiology) I’d like to think
I know how things work and
the sorts of issues that people
in this department care about
the most. Most importantly I
am scarily well organised and
always get things done... I ac-
tually have 3 mobile phones -
says it all! I’m a good listener
and will ALWAYS make time
for people, no matter how busy
things get. That’s one of my
main reasons for wanting this
role - I love to help people :)
unfairly, I will make it known
loud and clear that discrimina-
tion should NOT be tolerated!
• CAREER SUPPORT –
Transferrable skills courses
are ESSENTIAL for career
development. I will make sure
that postgraduates have a SAY
about changes, restructures or
organisation of these courses!
• NETWORKING AND SO-
CIAL SUPPORT – Life sci-
ences postgraduates should feel
free to voice their opinions...
over a PINT or slap-up meal!
I am determined to provide life
sciences postgraduates with
chilled-out social events to help
people network and integrate
within the departments and
more importantly, to RELAX
your prodigious brains after a
hard day of life science!

LISA HALE
panded this to the Hammersmith
Student Community, a society
run by students from the whole
campus, organising a programme
of similar activities. I have also
represented postgraduate stu-
dents on the Transferable Skills
Review Committee which is cur-
rently revising the University’s
transferable skills programme.
To these ends, I have been work-
ing closely with the AWO for
Medicine and the GSApresident.
If elected, I would love the op-
portunity to further develop the
various initiatives that we started.
I will work hard to represent all
the postgraduate students in our
faculty and make our postgradu-
ate experience even better. If I
win I intend to: 1) Improve the
social life on ALL the campuses
of Imperial College. 2) Strengthen
the communication between the de-
partmental representatives and stu-
dents. 3) Improve links between the
PG students on different campuses
within the faculty. 4) Make...

H
i fellow postgrads! I’m
Robert, first year PhD
at the School of Pub-
lic Health and I am running for
GSA President this year. Why?
Last year we have seen depart-
ment cuts, college bursary ‘va-
pourised’ and even refub work
which made you more stressed
out more than even on those
milestone deadlines. The GSA
team and I will be there to lis-
ten and represent you next year.
Representing you on academic
and welfare issues would be
my priority - Vote NO for cuts
to postgrad resources and fa-
cilities, NO to College bursary
cuts, NO to more unpaid teach-
ing commitments. More places
on ‘A’ graduate school courses.
I will also campaign for cheap-
H
ello, my name is Mi-
chaela and I’m cur-
rently in the 2nd year of
my PhD (Clinical Medicine Re-
search). The events team did an
excellent job last year but there’s
still room for improvements!
If elected as Events Coordina-
tor, I intend to:
– widen interest and participa-
tion in GSAevents and activities
as well as clubs and societies
– work together with clubs
and societies to organize more
joint events which are postgrad-
friendly
– offer an increased num-
ber and more diverse variety
of events / activities to cater to
all interests (film nights, mu-
sic nights and comedy nights
at various venues, trips outside
er non-showroom postgradu-
ate accommodation at our new
campus and better more-than
SCR food. Masters students
we will make sure your course
are kept up to standards. Social
wise I will continue to promote
cross-campus events and aim to
get everyone involved (and of
course keep the popular GSA
badminton sessions). I hope
get everyone to know our reps
at our welcoming event in Oc-
tober. Having done my Masters
at Imperial as well, I think I’d
pretty much know what you
will expect from us next year –
so vote me as GSA President!
