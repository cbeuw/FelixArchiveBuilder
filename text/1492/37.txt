lived together most of their lives,
and who argue so that they have
something to talk about.
“And another thing. I’m not having
you cutting up your catch in my
kitchen. I’ve just mopped up and I’m
not having you making a right old
mullock of the place. Not after last
time. I don’t know how you did it but
you got bits of skin and guts all over
my nice clean floor. Picking shrivelled
up pieces out from behind the cooker
for days after, I was. It’ll attract rats,
you see if it don’t.”
“Ah, quit your bellyaching woman,
it’s a beautiful day, I’ll cut it up in the
yard. Got that nice new workbench
set up there. This’ll be a good time to
make use of it.”
“Oh, I hate seeing them wriggle
around like that. Wouldn’t it be
kinder to just put it out of its misery?
You could do it when you make the
catch. Save you the bother of having
to keep it alive all the way back.”
“Oh love, you know it’s best if it’s
cooked as fresh as possible. A rub
down all over with the grater to get
rid of the skin, rub in some salt, a
quick gutting with the fillet knife to
get rid of them nasty insides, then
pop it in the oven. I’ve got it so I’m
right quick now. The last one were
still moving around when it went in,
and it were the best tasting meal I can
remember. When it comes time to
eat, meat’s meat, no matter what it’s
feeled.” He paused from his flow, and
some sympathy came into his voice.
“You don’t have to watch if you don’t
want to, duck.”
“No, I think I will. It’s the only
time I get to see you do any work,
you messing about with your catch.
The window’s right above the sink
anyway, and those dishes aren’t going
to do themselves.”
“It’ll be quick love. You’ll see. You
put the oven on soon as you see me
get back.”
“Don’t you tell me how to run my
own kitchen, Tom. Now be off with
you.”
“I’ll be off. Don’t forget to work
up an appetite. Them as eats most
pudding gets most meat.”
While he said this, the old man
shrugged on his jacket, and crammed
the bait into the inside rabbit pocket.
Then he picked up the fishing rod
with one hand, a car key from a
cracked cow-creamer with the other,
and walked out of the door.
The day was even warmer than it had
seemed from inside the house, and the
old man immediately knew that he was
going to be too hot with the jacket on.
The thought suddenly came into his
head of undressing in the yard while
cleaning the catch. One of the benefits
of having a house out in the country:
no nosey neighbours for miles around
to look over into your yard. He’d take
his clothes off and pose for her like
he sometimes did before they went to
bed. Wouldn’t she be surprised! And
the catch too of course. He chuckled
at the thought. His jacket was a
medium green tweed, with matching
waistcoat, brown flannel trousers, blue
bow tie, and grey flat cap completing
the rest of his ensemble. When he
was young he’d worked down at one
of the steel mills like most of the
men his age, and none of them would
have countenanced walking around
outside without a hat and jacket. Now,
though many years had passed, he
saw no reason to change, certainly not
because everybody else had. The old
man worked as a security guard at the
shopping mall in the city now, and it
horrified him to see the things grown
men walked around wearing: crumpled
cotton T-shirts that looked like the sort
of things they’d sleep in. No respect,
that’s what it was. Children grew up
not being taught any respect, and
when they got to be adults they’d no
respect then either. He’d been working
as a guard for fifteen years now. He
was a few years past retirement age,
but he was a good worker who knew
every inch of the shopping mall inside
out, he could spot a shoplifter just
from the way they walked through the
stores, and he was a valuable source
of experience to the younger security
guards. The management knew this,
and were happy to keep him on as
long as he wanted to stay. For his part
he enjoyed walking around all day. It
kept him fit and healthy, even though
him and his wife ate a lot these days.
The fat settled on her, but he stayed
lean and wiry. He’d gained a lot of
muscle from shifting metal around
the steel mill for over twenty years
in his youth, and even now he was
stronger than many men half his age.
The bow tie and waistcoat he wore on
weekends, to make a change from the
navy suit and tie he wore at the mall all
week. He didn’t have much of chin, so
his neck seemed to stretch up to his
mouth. Combined with a loose dewlap
and pronounced Adam’s apple, this
left him bearing a slight resemblance
to a turkey.
He walked round to the side of the
house, where his white Honda was
parked up, and a minute later he was
driving carefully along the macadam
track, before pulling onto the tarmac
of the main road and speeding away
across the dales.
He drove for upwards of thirty-
five miles before coming to a river.
It wasn’t the nearest river, but one
that was perfect for fishing, and one
that he hadn’t visited before. He
never liked to fish in the same place
twice. A small track led off from the
main road, roughly parallel to the
river margin, and he drove along this
slowly, looking for a likely spot.
When he had found the spot he
wanted, the old man parked the car
under the shade of a clump of trees
a little further along, then took the
fishing rod off the front seat next
to him, and walked over towards the
river. For about a ten metre distance
along a bend in the river, the bank
was free from bushes and trees. One
of those places along rivers kept clear
by the regular attentions of anglers,
but today, the only angling was being
done by a young boy. The day was
so good, that the middle-aged men
who make up the bulk of anglers had
been press-ganged into picnics and
outings with their wives and children,
leaving only those with no family
responsibilities free: the young boy,
and now, the old man.
The young boy was about ten years
old, with lank blond hair down to
his shoulders. He obviously didn’t
see the point of hairdressers and
his parents saw no reason to force
him to go too regularly. He had a
snub nose and blue eyes that were
presently surmounted by a furrowed
brow as he concentrated on the point
where his fishing line dropped down
into the water, willing a fish to take
a bite. He started with surprise when
the old man sat down next to him,
but was quickly distracted by envy
for the old man’s fishing rod, which
was an expensive new one, gleaming
silver and outshining the boy’s own
cheap red rod that he had saved up
his pocket money to buy.
“Nice day,” said the old man.
“Good to meet a fellow member of
the noble angling community.”
The boy grunted and returned to
concentrating on his fishing line. He
had caught one small roach so far,
but that had been over forty minutes
ago, and he was beginning to feel
frustrated. This was his first fishing
trip, and he’d imagined himself astride
the bank, flicking his line into the river,
and reeling out dozens of fat carp.
After the initial excitement of his first
catch, the reality was disappointing,
and now he felt that he hadn’t a chance
of catching another now that the old
man had arrived with his superior rod
that would be obviously preferable to
any passing fish.
The old man reached into his
jacket’s rabbit pocket, searching for
the bait. For one moment he thought
When it comes
time to eat, meat’s
meat, no matter
what it’s feeled
“
One of the benefits
of having a
house out in the
country: no nosey
neighbours for
miles around
“
he’d forgotten it, but then his fingers
closed around it, and he drew it
out. The boy saw the man take it
out from the corner of his eye, and
immediately whipped his head round.
Clutched in the old man’s hand was
the very latest handheld PlayStation
games console.
“Is that a PSP Go?” the boy said,
his eyes widening.
“Well I don’t know the name, but
it’s the latest model. You can have a
go if you like.”
“Brilliant,” said the boy, snatching
the console from the man’s proffered
hand and starting to press on the
buttons. “I wouldn’t have thought
someone like you would have one of
these.”
“Someone so old you mean?”
“No offence, mister.”
“None taken, young sir. Enjoy
being young while you can. This
belongs to my grandson. He’s up
at my car now. He’ll probably join
us once he’s stopped sulking about
going on a fishing trip. Wanted to
stay cooped up in the car playing
with that thing, but I said, no, you can
play those pocket games any day you
want, but going fishing on a day like
this is something that comes around
once in a month of Sundays, and I’m
taking this electronic nonsense with
me. Do you enjoy the game?”
“Yeah. Bit boring, though. Just one
of those card-collecting games, you
know.”
“Tell you what. My grandson’s got
a heap more games over in the car.
Lot of those fighting games with lots
of blood in them. You like those?
Well, come and pick out whatever
you want, and we’ll see if we can’t
get my grandson to come down and
fish with us. I dare say a young man
like yourself will have a much better
chance of persuading him than me.”
“Yeah, I’ll come. I could help him
fish if he’s not done it before.”
The boy leaped to his feet and
started jogging towards the direction
the old man indicated. The old man
kept pace behind him, walking quickly,
and taking his fishing rod with him.
