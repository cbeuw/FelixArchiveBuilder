eleting people is a grow-
ing form of therapy. Per-
haps happily, this is not
the latest jargon for serial-
killing, but is a synonym
for a re-appraisal of ‘Facebook friends’.
Facebook friends – those people you like
or love, but also those people who have
got married and not told you, even after
the event. If those two categories are in-
distinguishable to you… oh dear.
The fact that we use the word ‘Face-
book’ as an adjective for something like
friendship instantly devalues it. Think
of all those films in which friendship
is a strong theme: The Dam Busters,
Peter’s Friends, Bridge over the River
Kwai. Quite apart from them being from
the wrong age, the idea that the charac-
ters could be described as something so
flimsy as ‘Facebook friends’ seems an
almost perverse comparison.
That is not to say I do not use, or dislike
Facebook – it is good fun. Though I must
admit unless you are careful (or para-
noid) about your settings, it is a way for
everyone you have ever met to find you.
Problem 1 with the system is the
point at which one ‘adds’ a friend. How

from her since, needless to say.
I suppose one could restrict Facebook
friendships only to those one is in regular
contact with. But what would be the point
of that? I know people who use Facebook
only for the opposite reason – for people
they never see frequently because they
are overseas. Seems sensible, though if
you are in different time zones and doing
different things, communication for any-
thing more than correspondence chess
seems as unlikely as it is unworkable.
For myself, I use it for a mixture
of these two reasons, and much else
in between, as do most of my Face-
book ‘friends’. In practice this is rather
like having my current friends, school
friends, ex-girlfriends, drinking pals, and
my mother in the same room, with social
etiquette preventing anyone from intro-
ducing themselves to anyone else. Just
putting that list together has made me
more concerned. The sum total is that I
cannot say what I think as there is always
a ‘friend’I would rather not hear about it,
but I can get in touch with virtually any-
one of my acquaintances. Well, unless I
have deleted them for not knowing what
not to say at parties, that is.
many times have you added someone
via your phone after a bottle of wine
and have never really met or spoken to
them since? This is also serious factor in
problem 2: at what point do you remove
someone? In real life both of these seem
far easier: if you want to talk to some-
one and spend time with someone, you
do. If you do not, you do not. Not delet-
ing someone because you might want
to talk to them or know them has some
credence, but no more than keeping
something expensive with no immedi-
ate use for but you do not want to have
to replace. Having said that, removing
someone and even blocking them can
be a punishment: deletion is referred to
by many as the ultimate smack-down.
Fair enough, but if someone deleted
me and I found myself unable to recall
who they were, smack-down it would
not be. However, deleting someone you
see regularly is dangerous. I was once
deleted by a (now ex-) colleague who
had not bothered to check who she was
deleting. The awkwardness on her part
was delicious, though no apology was
forthcoming. I have not re-added her,
nor have I accepted a friend request

reatness is overrated.
Being awesome, epic,
or whichever other ad-
jective you want to use
to describe superior-
ity, is not worth it. It’s too much effort,
spurred by exaggerated accounts of
others who will fail to recognize your
achievements. We’ve spent our entire
lives being indoctrinated to aim high
and attempt to emulate great people, to
reach success in any way we can mea-
sure it. Whether you want to be a skilled
scientist, a powerful politician or a re-
spected artist, you have to work hard for
a long time and invest a lot of resources
to achieve your goals.
And for what? Immortality? Wealth?
What are you exactly going for? Do you
want to become the next Churchill, the
next Newton, the next Picasso? Good
luck with that. The Nobel prize is wide-
ly regarded as the highest achievement
in the fields it rewards; and yet, how
many winners can you recall apart from
the obvious ones? Hundreds have been
awarded the prize, but most are only re-
membered by specialists in their sector
and Wikipedia articles.
But even if you do manage to become
the next Big Thing, eternal glory is not
something you’ll achieve. Even if your
name goes down in history along with
the other great ones, there will be a day
when all of what you have achieved is
as relevant as the professional life of
the gas station attendant down the road..
Nothing lasts forever, if I’m allowed a
cliché, and the human race makes no
exception.
Do you do it for the wealth and ben-
efits that greatness entails? Maybe I’m
speaking only for myself, but I worked
hard at school to get into a good univer-
sity, where I’m working even harder to
get a good PhD placement, where I’ll
work to get a good job, where difficulty
will go hand-in-hand with achievement,
and so on. We live in a society that re-
wards hard work with the possibility of
more, harder work. Any material gains
are mostly accidental, and always con-
ditional on your ability to keep up with
the fruits of your labour. If you have
a magnum opus, any future effort will
always be overshadowed by your pre-
vious one; if you’re establishing an ex-
cellent track record, you’re setting ever
increasing high standards for yourself,
and you can’t afford to slip.
Besides, who said that you’re going
to succeed? There’s always someone
better than you, and this is true for all
but one person on earth. If you think
that your skills alone are going to carry
you to the top, you’re probably mistak-
en. You’ll need a healthy dose of luck,
which is, by definition, uncontrollable.
Knowing the right people, being at the
right place, catching the right opportu-
nity. How much of this can you influ-
ence? “Making your own luck” is all
well and dandy, but after a certain point
fate might just be ignoring you.
You keep working harder and you
get all the lucky breaks, and you finally
make it to whatever personal parameter
of greatness you have. Now you can
wallow in your awesomeness as you
are barely rewarded for the monumen-
tal quantities of effort you put into it,
carefully avoiding the fact that it will,
inevitably, amount to nothing. Was it
worth it?
So I urge you, be lazy. Be satisfied
with your simplicity. Be average. Be me-
diocre. Ignore your potential for great-
ness, and be one in the amorphous mob
of society. Pleasure yourself with vicari-
ous joy, be it in the so-called achieve-
ment of eleven strangers on a football
pitch or the foibles of self-proclaimed
celebrities. Never mind that you’d be
little more than an animal with some in-
tellect, caving in to your basest desires!
Never mind that there’d be nothing to
distinguish you from virtually any other
human being on the planet! Be medio-
cre, for it’s too hard to be great.
Surprise! A funding gap has
emerged in universities. If you
were in charge of estimating
how many universities would
ask for as much money as
humanly possible and you pre-
dicted less than 100%, I feel
like you have only yourself to
blame.
So many universities are
charging the full £9000 that
the loans system is going to
implode under the weight of
all the stupidity that was in-
volved in bringing this about,
and the only options available
are really appealing things
like reducing university plac-
es or just cutting funding in.
Hooray!
NUS president Aaron Porter
said some words to a man
with a microphone, as per
usual, but I’m beginning to
wonder if a Harry Potter loo-
kalike is the best representa-
tive here. Not sure if that’s
sending the right message.
Not that the message is be-
ing heard by anyone. Obvious-
ly, no-one gives a shit about
what the National Union of
Students thinks because it’s
really only one step up from
a Year 7 Student Council.
But if the best we’re going to
get on BBC News is “these
poorly conceived funding ar-
rangements blah blah yawn”
then yes, we need a change
of tack.
So what I’m thinking is that
we club together and start up
a militant wing of the NUS.
We’ll do all the cool militant
wing stuff like pixelate our
faces when we go on the
news, and claim responsibil-
ity for any errors found in ex-
ams, that sort of thing. Then
the next time someone wants
a comment about where it
all went wrong, we’ll say we
warned them and then laugh
manically while Aaron Porter
claims he has nothing to do
with us.
Again, no-one’s going to lis-
ten to us. But if our university
is going down the drain, a
career in white-collar terror-
ism is a neat horizontal step
on the career ladder from
disgruntled student. Viva la
revolucion.

Who wants to
get militant
with me?
