PHOENIX
To recall colour beyond the fracture of days,
Or relish a dawn from Edenâ€™s sweet gaze.
Though they lie, deceitful from their roots,
The perverted perceptions of those fatal fruits.
Those true fallacies,
Queens and harlequins of the soul,
Conspiring faithfully in our candid futilities,
Are but sublime details, symbols of the whole.
