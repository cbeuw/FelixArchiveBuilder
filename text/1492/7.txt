Imperial’s population has just grown by
several thousand. No, there hasn’t been
some clerical error or mass invasion – we
now have our very own bee colony.
Over the last decade populations of the
European Honey Bee (Apis mellifera)
have been rapidly declining, with the
population in England halving over
the last 20 years. Various factors are to
blame, including the Varroa mite and the
lethal viruses it spreads, the continued
expansion of industrial agriculture,
pesticide exposure and overwork.
However, this is one problem that the
masses, rather than governments, have
helped to solve. 90% of the beehives
registered in the U.K. belong to amateurs
– farmers or people just keeping them at
home in their gardens. In the past three
years there has been a doubling in the
number of hives registered – from 40,000
in 2007 to 80,000 in 2010 – and with it,
a doubling of UK bee numbers. There’s

also been a similar increase in urban
beekeeping – hives in roof gardens or
allotments inside cities, a trend Imperial
is now a part of.
Imperial’s Facilities and Property
Management team, led by Nick Roalfe,
have put a bee hive in the Secret Garden
behind Ethos. The garden isn’t very well
known (hence the ‘secret’bit) but is open
to all Imperial students and staff. An
initial bee stock has just been put into the
hive, with the hope that the population
will multiply, perhaps filling a second
hive.
Students from the Environmental
Society, who will be going on a
beekeeping course to learn how to keep
the bees happy and healthy, will manage
the colony and will train future members
to do the job, adding the position of
Apiarist to their committee. Anyone can
get involved – email esoc@imperial.

Acolony of bees is made up
of a single queen, several
hundred male bees or drones,
and up to 50,000 female worker
bees. The queen bee can live for
up to three years and in that time
can lay more than 500,000 eggs.
Beekeepers can start out with a
natural colony, an artificial one
(packed in a box) or a nucleus,
which is a core colony with fewer
drones and workers. Colonies
also vary in temperament, so
we as beginners obtained docile
ones unlikely to swarm. We also
have the traditional suits and a
smoker, a device used to sur-
round the hive with smoke, mak-
ing the bees think that there’s a
forest fire and focus on eating
their honey rather than swarm-
ing, allowing us to work in the
hive without mass attack. Next
spring we’ll be checking that the
queen is laying eggs, and clearing
away debris from the winter like
dead bees and cobwebs. Over
the summer the colony will be
growing quickly and could reach
up to 50,000 bees. If space for
egg laying and honey storing runs
out, the queen leaves the hive
with some workers to start a new
colony and the bees feed a larva
with Royal Jelly to make a new
queen. In August, we’ll be collect-
ing the honey – a good summer
can produce around 40lbs. In Au-
tumn, this honey will be replaced
by feeding the bees with a sugar
solution, and then the whole cy-
cle can repeat for another year.
Bee-keeping explained
Bees introduced to Imperial’s
‘Secret Garden’
were excited about the opportunity: “To
get the chance to take part in beekeeping
is not something many students,
especially those living in central London
get to do – it’s almost unimaginable. It’s
really exciting that we start off with one
hive out of about a quarter of a million
that are in the UK, and with years
we aim to expand our apiary to two.
Somehow the name “Imperial Apiary”
sounds like we should have little flying
stormtroopers, and we like both of those
ideas a lot. Ideally we’d make things like
Drambuie or Mead along side one of the
food societies with any excess honey.
The hives are part of Imperial’s long
term sustainability strategy, known
as StepChange. Recent achievements
have included the Student Switch Off
campaign, which saw a 3% reduction in
Halls’electricity usage, and the ComPod,
an on-site composter that turns Imperial’s
food waste into compost rather than
sending it to landfill.
