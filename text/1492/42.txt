"The most
blinding orgasm
on earth will be
like a faint tickle
in this Heaven"
28
W
hen they said that you see
a bright light when you
die, you did not realise
that it was actually a 60
watt desk-lamp.
You also did not know just how fast
cars could go round that bend, or how
easily shopping can get broken when it is
hit. Like bottles, boxes of eggs...human
bodies.
“Am I dead?” you ask. Although you
are fairly certain of the answer, you
are surprised that you can even voice
the question. The desk-lamp is, quite
conveniently on a desk in a very ordinary
looking cubicle. If you are dead, the major
religions have vastly over-exaggerated the
afterlife.
“That's all anyone ever asks,” a reply
comes in to the office, followed by a man.
At least, you think he is a man...since he
looks like one, a John you'd say. He wears
his shirt half-untucked, a pen in the chest
pocket, a faint air of extreme boredom.
“Never “how are you?” or “what's the
weather like out there?” It's all me, me,
me. And yes, by the way – you are dead.”
You gulp hard. Your partner. Your
friends. You will never see them again.
You turn to John, “Is this Heaven?”
A thought dawns on you and you gulp
harder, “or is this Hell?”
“Everyone always asks that as well.”
John rolls his eyes. He sighs, before
shrugging – might as well get on with it,
“This is neither Heaven nor Hell...for you
at least. Your final destination is currently
in design. We would have had it ready on
time but we didn't know you'd be joining
us so soon. While you wait, you can help
us by designing the afterlife for your
worst enemy.”
“What? Why? Why me? Why my worst
enemy?” your mind floods with questions
and the dam of your mouth cannot hold
them back. You did not even know you
had a worst enemy but that thought
remains unvoiced.
“We like to personalise eternity, to
provide custom-fit endlessness the
discerning consciousness.” John explains.
You see now the group manager pin
on his collar and the precise architect's
creases around his eyes and forehead. “As
for your worst enemy, they died recently
as well and we can't think of anyone who
knows what they deserve.”
“What do I have to do?” you ask, rapidly
acclimatising to the rather bizarre next
chapter of your existence. The revelation
that there is an afterlife is eclipsed by the
revelation that your long-forgotten GCSE
in Design and Materials will actually be of
some use at last.
“We will provide you with pens and
paper.” John the manager explains as he
lays down rolls of blue schematic paper
on your desk. You did not see them when
he came in but your mind seems very
at ease with spatial abnormalities at the
moment. “Take as long as you want. Call
me when you're finished or if you have
any questions.”
With that, he exits the cubicle and
leaves you to it. At first, the task seems
overwhelming. An entire afterlife? To treat
or torture someone for an eternity? How
is one mind as small as yours supposed
