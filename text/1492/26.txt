Island Flotantes, Lake
Titicaca, Peru.
The indigenous Uru people
make their homes on
artificial “floating islands”,
built from dried totora
reeds. They craft their boats
by binding bunches of the
reeds together. Although
they spend their whole
lives floating about, the Uru
lifestyle is in fact very struc-
tured, with strict adherence
paid to routine.

Trinidad, Cuba.
A common institution in
Cuba is the Senior Citizens’
Club, a place for old people
to enjoy themselves:
to chat, drink and play
games. “Actually, these
guys were all pretty drunk”
says Daniel, laughing a
little at the recollection.
Below, Cubans young and
old mix together on the
streets of Trinidad.
