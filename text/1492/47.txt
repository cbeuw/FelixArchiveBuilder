Just like oil and water...
Perhaps we should remain separate.
There is that permanent impermeable membrane
That lies between Ying and Yang
Preventing them from meeting half way;
Mixing, and becoming grey...
These iron wrought manacles of fear that fastened our pride
Disassembled, and reconstituted our minds.
The same iron drilled through the earth
The centre cannot hold: Things Fall apart
You see, a glorious warrior nation was paciﬁed
Their men of valour and chiefs made to cower undigniﬁed
We were made captives in our own land
Slapped and rejected at each attempt to voice our opinion or merely raise our hand
Our laws were no longer our own
Each person made to answer to the district judge - a man heʼd never known
The old ways are gone and things fall apart.
(The power of the oil drills) Its power quakes beneath our feet;
The mighty tremble.
The earthʼs kernel is ripe to bursting; it oozes black blood.
Its abundance is harvested by the reapers
With scythes tainted by malice and greed
That marks our ground,
The same blades used to mark our graves.
The oil drills caused the earth to shake
Our polluted rivers and land lay raped
Fishermen canʼt ﬁsh in a dead oil lagoon
But a young boy still looks up to ask his father –Why- there is –no- food
So weʼd had enough.
So we thought weʼd make a stand
And arise as a people take the law into our own hands
But who would have known?
The drillers paid oﬀ our government, to catch us in our sleep
Peppered bullets across the sky, and this is why my black blood leaks
Why do I merely subsist in this physiologically imposed periphery?
Double edge!
Of supposed oil riches forgone
And empty sovereign wealth funds
Why do you mock us?
Although we claim to wield you,
Pressing against us your merciless claw detaches
Seam from seam marrow from marrow;
The dry bones are scattered
But who will gather them up?
