I
t has been a good year for
the City & Guilds RFC.
The team is unbeaten
so far this season after
wins against the RSM
and Oxford’s Balliol College
but its biggest adventure is still
ahead of it. The committee has
worked tirelessly to organize a
tour that is going to be remem-
bered for years to come. On 1st
July, the C&G RFC will travel
to Berlin to partake in an inter-
national Sevens tournament, the
Rugby union Sevens, as well as
establishing contacts with the
local engineering universities
before returning to London on
4th July.
Funds for the tour were raised
on multiple occasions through-
out the year, culminating in an
epic C&G Club Night at Chateau
Six which was jointly organized
by the CGCU and C&G RFC.
Further support was received by
Laing O’Rourke and Pathmo-
tion.
The club has grown from
strength to strength this year
which is mirrored by the record
attendance on this tour. No less
than 24 students will be taking
part in this tour which has re-
ceived generous support from
Imperial College Union and the
City & Guilds College Associa-
tion.
With such a strong team, Sev-
ens captain Niall Watson is look-
ing to perform well at the tour-
nament. Being the only student
team in the competition, they
have their work cut out for them.
Their opponents are no begin-
ners either.
Defending champion RK 03
Berlin just finished 8th in Ger-
many’s first division and RC
Prague just won the KB Extra-
liga, the most reputed competi-
tion in the Czech Republic. The
young teams from RC Zug, RC
Ticino (both Switzerland), Vi-
enna Celtics (Austria) and Cre-
mona (Italy) have plenty of Sev-
ens experience, too. This tour
is going to be a tremendous ex-
perience for the entire club and
should bring them all together –
both on and off the pitch.
