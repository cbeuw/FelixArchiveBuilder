STRIPPERS
Our culture is hypocritical in many ways.
Sex is used to sell products, get jobs and
find mates but it is rarely addressed in a
direct and honest way. The sex industry
represents a significant portion of the world’s
economy. In many countries, it operates in a
grey area between legality and illegality. In the
UK, it is worth an estimated £1bn and there
are many thousands more women working
illegally as prostitutes on Britain’s streets or in
brothels across the country. The line between
journalism and voyeurism is also thin, but for
some reason, watching people have sex is
considered prurient while watching them get
killed is not. The word pornography becomes
an epithet for visual coverage of an activity
at last as basic to humankind as eating and
probably more so. Photographers who choose
the subject of sexuality often become a self
produced crusader, on a mission to draw back
the curtains and let in the light.
