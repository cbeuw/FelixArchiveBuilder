“Yeah, these guys were proper jokers!” The Physics fresher smiles
nostalgically as he leafs through a stack of photographs, taken
during his travels last year. He recounts the journey that took him
across Latin America, the places he visited and the people he met
In Cuba, he shifted from town to town, sleeping alongside local
families and soaking up the culture. In Peru, he immersed himself
in the strange, isolated communities of Lake Titicaca, fascinated by
their unique lifestyles.
His photographs capture the spirit of this exploration, this un-
charted voyage through a young, mysterious continent. Like his
photographs, Danielʼs stories burst with detail. In a frank and self-
eﬀacing manner, he describes his journey as he experienced it,
letting others make of it what they will.

Taquile, Lake Titicaca, Peru.
The people of Taquile inhabit a world untouched by time. Their small
island, surrounded on all sides by the freshwaters of Lake Titicaca, is
home to a culture that has firmly resisted the pressures of mod-
ernisation. Daniel explains, “the locals aren’t hostile, but they keep
themselves to themselves.” The patterned clothing worn by the men
indicates to the community their marital status.
