GY PSIES
Throughout human history the most
successful defence against uncertainty
caused by otherness and strangers has been
territorial and functional separation. As a
result of this, in Eastern Europe, a relatively
prosperous region by global standards, the
vast majority of gypsies live in misery and want.
Prejudice against them is wide and deep, and,
on several occasions since 1989, has led to
vigilante-style violence and pogroms.
