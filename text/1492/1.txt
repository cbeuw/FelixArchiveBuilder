The Union have unveiled ambitious plans
to “increase the size, scale and profile” of
the Summer Ball in years to come, say-
ing that the “ultimate aim” would be to
host the event “in Hyde Park or a simi-
lar venue” and attract a huge number of
students from across London. The news
comes with just a week to go until this
year’s Ball, which features headliners
Laura Marling and Ian Brown.
The Union’s plans for the future in-
clude further collaborations with other
universities, building on this year’s joint
involvement of King’s and Goldsmiths.
The Union say that they have “an expres-
sion of interest” for collaboration next
year with UCL. A spokesperson for the
Union said that the “focus is the enjoy-
ment of students at Imperial” but that
increased costs from increasing the scale
and “dynamic” of the ball mean that
“a wider attendee base is needed”. The
spokesperson pointed to events such as
the Leeds Student Ball and Cardiff Uni-
versity’s Beach Party as “benchmarking”
events to aspire to for their large crowds
and high-profile lineups.
The Union are also looking to in-
crease the amount of sponsorship they
receive for the Summer Ball. The sup-
pliers of Jägermeister, who are provid-
ing significant equipment, stock and
staff at this year’s ball, have expressed
interest in being a key sponsor for next
year supplying both staging and product
support, subject to the scale of the ball
increasing, say the Union.
There have been some minor changes
to the plans for this year. In addition to
the main Queen’s Lawn stage and a now
downsized Prince’s Gardens stage, the
Great Hall is to be used as a club for
dance music, as in previous years. The

ambitious future
for Summer Ball
Holding it in Hyde Park would

tions in licensing in Prince’s Gardens
have limited the size of the Prince’s Gar-
dens stage, which will now feature stu-
dent bands, with the Queen’s Lawn be-
coming the focus for the rest of the live
music, with the headliners playing there.
Ticket sales from other universities are
believed to be lower than hoped, with the
majority of the approximate 1000 tickets
sold thus far being to Imperial students.
The Union declined to confirm or deny
the figures, saying that the number of
tickets sold “remains commercially sen-
sitive” but the spokesperson said that
they were confident that there would be
“much greater ticket sales from all in-
volved Unions” in the run-up to the Ball.
The Union said that the up-scaling
of the Summer Ball was an “ambitious
initiative with massive future potential”
whilst recognizing that this “as with
all new ventures and changes will take
some time to bed in.”
There have been some eyebrows
raised at the decision of Deputy Presi-
dent (Finance & Services) Ravi Pall to
take a week of leave in the run-up to
the Ball. When questioned about this
he said that he was still active via email
and had attended meetings relating to
the Summer Ball while on leave. He
argued that the preparation for the Ball
was now wholly logistical and so his ab-
sence would have no negative impact.
President Alex Kendall, who as Pall’s
line manager approved his leave, simi-
larly defended the decision saying, “the
role of the DPFS is on a strategic level
regarding the long and medium term.
They are not involved with the final
weeks of operational issues.”
The Summer Ball is next Saturday
18th June. Tickets are £45 (or £50
on the night) and can be bought from
the Union’s website.
