PHOENIX
His sister is always busy
got to keep to time
time is the law
tick tock.
His sister has no plants
inorganic sleek
smooth, straight, safe
she used to carry the stream things
like he did
zip zap
they are ﬂies, ﬁlthy ﬂies
zap zip
every night, waiting on every street corner.
Architects made them twins
one fell
out of glamour
out of order
out of use
ﬁngers no longer roll
over his torso
seek his waist
rain disﬁgures him
peels off the skin
disintegrate, degenerate, deteriorate
yet he is found by me
he is more than his sister.
I love him.
