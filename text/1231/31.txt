The Imperial College Rifle
and Pistol Club made its way
to the battlefields of the
BUSA Clay Pigeon Shooting
Competition to test its mettle
against the other British uni-
versities.
Friday 22nd February, having
finished all our lectures and
packed our bags we met at
Southside at 6pm. Only one
person didn't show up (Koichi
"may his name for ever be
Damned" Tanaka), but Phil was
available to take his place in
short notice. A n d so, to the
theme of The A-Team scream-
ing from the minibus' speakers,
we left on the 4 hour trip to the
Travellodge in Telford where
we would be spending the
night before the competition.
We arrived in Telford some
time after 10pm and we made
Stop The Pigeon
our way to our rooms for some
"serious preparation" for the
next day.
We crawled out of our beds
red eyed and bushy tailed
Saturday morning, although
some had fallen asleep on the
floor amongst the previous
night's detritus. With only a
quick stop at Tesco's for break-
fast, we proceeded to the
BUSA competition grounds.
We arrived as the sky dark-
ened and storm clouds started
to unload their cargo of snow
and sleet upon us. The muddy
field we parked our vehicles in
rapidly turned into a scene
from a Christmas postcard; all
of us looking like snowmen!
We sought refuge in the club-
house from the blizzard, with
only a cup of tea to warm us.
Despite high winds and spo-
radic snowing our spirits were
high; the poor conditions
brought all the teams to an
even footing. The competition
consisted of 7 traps releasing a
total of 50 clays per person
(200 clays per team!) and a
hundred bird flush. Each per-
son from a team shot each of
the 7 traps, and the scores of
each individual were totalled
to get the team score. In the
immensely enjoyable, but chal-
lenging, hundred bird flush the
entire team stood in a row as a
100 clays were launched over
their heads. The whole team
opened fire and tried to shoot
as many of the clays as possi-
ble! The score from the flush
was added to the team's score
giving a total out of 300.
At the end of the afternoon,
our shooting over, we made
our way to the clubhouse to
receive our scores:
The A-team did well with a
total score of 171 giving them
12th place out of 41, while the
B team arrived in 22nd posi-
tion. The C team, came 29th
with their score of 101, and
finally, the Ladies' team, shot a
score of 72, giving them 39th
place, although they came 6th
out of all the ladies' teams.
Special mention must be
given to Guy as he got one of
the top 5 best individual scores
in the whole competition.
If you think your good
enough, if no one else can help
you and if you can find us in
the rifle range in the IC Sports
Centre (Wednesday and
Saturday afternoons), maybe
you can join the Rifle Club.

Foiled Again!
Overall this year we came top
of the south eastern league by
three points. This is a fantas-
tic achievement and the first
time since I have been cap-
tain. Both Leucha and Witolda
have improved a great deal
this year and this really
showed in the matches with
some well executed hits.
Sadly one of our usual play-
ers, Camille, was unable, to
make many of the matches
due to a most unfortunate
knee injury, however she was
able to fence i n the final
match against U C L which
secured our victory in the
league.
IC Ladies 76 85 Cambridge
Having won the league we
then drew Cambridge for the
last sixteen match.
Cambridge were an excep-
tionally strong team, with six
players to our three just for
starters! In the epee, the three
internationals outclassed our
team who are not strictly
epeeists, so we lost 45-31.
However in the foil we man-
aged to hold our own to obtain
a deserved win. Unfortunately
this was not enough for an
overall victory. Although we
were losing initially in the foil,
Katherine (captain) managed
to pull the score up to 30-29
from the losing 18-25. This
gave the whole team the
impetus to carry on the win-
ning streak. The final foil score
was 45-40. This retains our
record of only losing one foil
match this term, and this was
against Reading who, again,
had many internationals in
their team.
