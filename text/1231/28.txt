Another week, another crossword. I'm trying to make it a bit harder
these days as it's nearing the end of term, so hopefully you might find
this weeks offering a little tricky, or maybe it's just a pile of wank -1 don't
know. Last week's winner is E m l y n Corrin, Physics. Nice one. Another
bumper G F Q Q for you lucky wee scamps this week. It seems that some
of our mam players are achieving local celebrity status. Anthony
Rodrigues, for example, has been attracting groupies, enticing random
girls into his sordid, sexual web of quizzery. Personally, I fully endorse
this kind of behaviour, and encourage all you fudge-packers to exploit
the situation while you can. Spread the love. Dr. Hot-Fudge
