Goat Wars Extreme
Similar to Goat Wars. In
fact it may be identical,
but it's got a different
name to try and attract
stupid people to watch-
ing re-runs of boring tel-
evision.
Pik-a-boo
A night of R'n'B. That's
Rob and Benny to you.
They'll be performing a
modern dance interpre-
tation of this very diary
section. No, only joking,
it's music.
Cheesy Wotsits
Or smelly genitals, to
some people. Smelly
genitals. Not to be con-
fused with smelly
sportsmen. The distinc-
tion becomes less clear
after ten pints.
Comedy Night
Haw haw haw haw haw

Ayoade. H a w haw h a w

please stop. No more.

Supersonic
The Union will pay for a
trip on Concorde to N e w
York for anyone who
turns up. A n d if you
believe that... Can't
think of anything else to
say.

Kent, All Weekend
Charlotte Gray
Whatever you do, don't
mention the war. I did a
few minutes ago, but I
think I got away with it.
If you don't get the refer-
ence, watch Fawlty
Towers instead.
Fellowship of the R i n g
I'm trying to be funny
about this, but as you
can tell, I'm not really in
the mood. This film is on
lots all over the place -
I'm sure you can find it
somewhere nearby.
Ocean's Eleven
Apparently this was a
pretty miserable film
last time they tried, but
it didn't have George
Clooney in then, so it
can't have been good,
but it is now. So there.
We Were Soldiers
Not us here at Felix
Towers, of course. It's
the name of the film.
About soldiers. Or at
least they were once.
Rated 18 for containing
Australians.
Goat
The no holds barred
account of three goats in
a dramatic battle with a
troll who lives under the
bridge, who is deter-
mined to eat them. But
the goats are too clever...

Yet another bloody gig
from the monkey-faced
monkey man from the
North of England, where
they all dress like
chimps. Bah.

Top Scottish alternative
rockers Idlewild roll into
KCL on the first week of
their new tour, with a
cracking new LP more of

KCU, 8pm
Mower
Dangerously lo-fi noises
from Graham Coxon's
(yes, he of Blur) pro-
tegees on his Transcopic
label. Go and damage
your hearing.
Monarch, 8pm. £6.00
N e w Flesh
Now, to me, that sounds
like the waistline of a
newly-porked-out celebri-
ty bloater. But in fact,
they're a top hip-hop act
from up north. So there.
Camden Monarch, 8pm
Vagina Monologues
Sadly, a show rather
than an all girl post-
punk pop act, possibly
dressed only in OXO
aprons and fishnets.
Still, a man has to have a
dream, eh...
