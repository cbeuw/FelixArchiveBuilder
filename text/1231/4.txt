Take our money and run.
Shell Personal Development Award
You can use our £500 Personal Development Award for almost anything. You could take
the money and further develop an existing talent in sport, music or the arts. You could use
it to run a community project, plan an expedition, learn a language or do voluntary work.
Whatever the project we can help you run with it.
All we ask in return is that you come back and tell us all about it. The award is open to stu-
dents of all disciplines, with the exception of final year students.
Visit www.shell.com/careers for an application form or telephone 0845 600 1819.
Using Question 11 of the application form, please describe how you would use your Shell
Personal Development Award and what you expect to gain from it.
Closing date for applications 26*' April 2002.
