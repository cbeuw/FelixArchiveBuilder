Alternative Careers Fair
Wednesday s a w Civil
Engineering play host to the
multitudinous hordes who had
gathered for the second
London Alternative Careers
Fair, Sustainable Futures.
Organised by E-Soc and the
LSE environmental initiatives
network, the aim of the fair
was to present career options
to students who don't want to
sell their souls to 'big busi-
ness', with an emphasis on
sustainability, environmental-
ism and ethics.
Tom Tibbits, E-Soc chair and
driving force behind the event
said that he felt students
ought to know that there were
indeed options other than con-
sultancy and financial servic-
es for Imperial graduates, and
that the Union careers fair,
held annually i n November,
does not provide students
with enough such options.
The fair opened with a talk
from David Kingsley, entitled
'A slice of the Pie', in which he
tried to persuade those pres-
ent that it was indeed possi-
ble to work in a field that was
both ethical and sustainable,
while still making a decent liv-

tary sectors were slowly being
eroded, as charities, N G O s
and voluntary organisations
become more business-like
and efficient. A number of
other talks followed, on a
range of topics from renew-
able energy sources to ethical
investment.
A s well as these talks vari-
ous companies and organisa-
tions were running stalls, with
such diverse groups as the
Teacher Training agency and
Scientists for Global responsi-
bility represented
The organisers were very
pleased with the turnout, as
over five hundred students
passed through the doors dur-
ing the afternoon - about
twice as many as last year -
and those that attended felt
that it had been a useful and
informative experience.
