Medics Emerge Victorious
IC Medics 22 1 7 I C I
This game should have been
the final w i t h both teams
favourite for the title. Imperial
Medics by their own admis-
sion have had a disappointing
season and for the first time
next year will find themselves
in the same league as IC so
this game was an important
gauge as to how they will fare
in 2002-2003, especially as IC
finished second in their
league.
The match kicked off amid
glorious sunshine on a pristine
pitch at Teddington. IC were
obviously very fired up for the
match and within the first 5
minutes were a try up after
some poor defending out
wide. IC were to increase this
lead shortly after with 2 more
tries and so after 20 minutes
were 17-3 in the lead. The ref-
eree made some bizarre deci-
sions in this half most notably
when he ruled out a Medics
try claiming that the player's
foot had passed the dead ball
line, this was further com-
pounded by a yellow card to
the player for apparent
overindulgent language. The
rest of the first half was fairly
nip and tuck but the Medics
backs gained in confidence
throughout and after a tenta-
tive start began to come to the
ascendancy. The forwards
were fairly evenly matched
with IC exerting pressure in
the scrums and Medics domi-
nating the lineouts.
The half-time whistle blew
with the scoreline very much
in IC favour. The medics
realised that last years
resounding victory was not
IC Virgins
We drove to Guildford in the
spangly minibus driven by
snotty-posh with stunning
driving. Our beautiful head
coach, Dave, met us with his
home-brew creation, w h i c h
was evil/lush. The match was
kwality, and all the training
finally paid off, seeing the for-
wards doing rolling mauls,
and the backs their slinky
moves. Tries were scored by
Gem (x2 due to the good shag-
ging she's getting), Kate
(slinky roll off a maul), Helen
(driving over the line and huge
celebration for her first try),
and Alexis (also a Virgin try:
capital job).
Credit goes to Hui Ling for
nearly scoring three tries, but
never managing to convert her
pazzaz into points. Hannah,
battling against the elements,
managed one conversion.
Forward of the match goes
to Dappy, for her good stuff at
number eight, and her consis-
tent support throughout the
match. Back of the match goes
to Alexis for her first try and
slinky moves. Huy Ealing was
nominated for player of the
match by the opposition. Fair
play: she had to drink the
rankest dirty half yard I've
seen in my twenty years.
Fresher gets a mention for her
questionable taste on the
dance floor last Wednesday, of
course she knew what she
was doing.
The ref gets a special men-
tion for having been in
Hollyoaks. He was head of
Hollyoaks community college:
the one who was shagging
Ruth. Oh yes, we mix with the
classiest celebs...
Kate
going to be repeated and that
without passion and hard
graft IC would be the victors.
The second half began with
an immediate change in the
Medics momentum a long kick
from scrum half, James Logan,
was chased down by Nnamdi
Obi resulting in a 5 metre
throw-in to the Medics and a
subsequent forwards try by
Ben Spiegelberg (with a little
help from Dimitri Amiras). This
proved to be the spark that
was much needed in the team
and from that moment on the
Medics raised their game,
with IC unable to maintain
possession due to hard tack-
ling and dominant forward
loose play. It was only a mat-
ter of time before another try
was scored and this was
achieved by the individual
brilliance of Nnamdi Obi who
coming on at half time made a
significant difference to the
offensive line. The game was
still tightly in the balance (15-
17) IC clearly did not want to
lose the match and held on for
10 minutes before finally their
resolve gave way. Hani Abdel-
Hadi in his less familiar scrum
half role spotted on overlap on
the left of the pitch this was
exploited resulting in a final
try on the touchline for Will
Mellior. James Morris then
slotted the conversion to bring
the score to 22-17, with only 3
minutes left the Medics were
able to hold their position and
remained in the IC half until
the final whistle was sounded.
The match was played to a
high standard and IC proved
worthy opponents. Imperial
Medics look forward to the fix-
tures next season with them.
