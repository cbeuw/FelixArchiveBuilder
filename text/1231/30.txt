Firsts victorious over UCL
UCL I 2 3 IC I
It was going to be a battle of
truly gladiatorial proportions.
Imperial, w i t h a very poor
start to the season going
away to the current league
leaders and joint favourites
for the cup. Still, all that did-
n't really matter did it? The
conditions, as usual for
Shenley, involved a soggy
pitch, force 10 gale, and just
to spice things up - no refer-
ee. So it was that IC kicked
with the w i n d and down the
hill in the first half.
After an even start, a
momentary lapse of concen-
tration at the back allowed
U C L in behind the IC
defence, and suddenly it was
1-0. A goal down, and playing
against the w i n d and this tie
just got a whole lot tougher.
This appeared to spur IC on
and they began to make the
most of the w i n d and slope. A
free kick came close, and
Forsythe steered the ball
wide from in front of goal
after a cross from the left.
Nevertheless IC continued to
push forward, but quality
chances were at a premium.
On the stroke of half-time IC,
spurred on by coach
Cardines, pressured the U C L
left back by his own corner
flag who was forced into a
backpass to his keeper - mis-
take N o . l . Mistake No. 2
involved the keeper air-kick-
ing at the ball and watching
it dribble over his own line,
before smashing it into the
back of his own net in anger
and frustration.
The second half started as
badly for IC as the first half
had finished for UCL. Within
minutes, the U C L right
winger hitting a curling left
foot shot from the edge of the
box that evaded the best
efforts of keeper Vasquez. 2-1
down, uphill and into the
wind - a whole big world of
trouble.
A period of U C L pressure
came to nothing, however,
and IC began to get the ball
on the deck and stroke it
around. Mark Curry, an earli-
er replacement for Anis,
heard his hamstring do some-
thing nasty and was prompt-
ly carried off. Nick Jones was
also substituted, giving
Anthony Senner and Seb
Storbacka a chance. Seb
began to run at the U C L
defence and with half an hour
to go, his efforts paid off.
Taking the ball on the bounce
he rounded the centre back
before firing a left foot (what
else?) shot past the U C L
keeper. 2-2 and game on
again. It was now the turn of
IC keeper Vasquez to do his
bit for the cause - a series of
fantastic clean saves kept IC
in it, and w i t h ten minutes
left a Storbacka through ball
found Forsythe, who prompt-
ly found the back of the net
with his right foot. 3-2, come
on! A n d so it was down to the
defence for the barrage that
was to come. Ant Senner was
amazing, as was Joe
M c M a h o n and what they did-
n't cut out was dealt with by
Cowley, Bureau and of course
- Vasquez. After an eternity,
the final whistle blew and the
league leaders were out -
well the cup isn't the cup
these days without IC is it?
Bowling Oxford Tour
The IC Tenpin Bowling Club
recently attended the annual
ULU Masters event, a Scratch
and Handicap singles tourna-
ment open to all U L U bowlers.
It proved a very successful
day, with IC bringing home 10
of the 13 trophies on offer.
The first round saw Tim
Harbour and Gray Johnston
qualify in first and second
place in the Scratch division,
with Jez and Trevor qualifying
first and third in the Handicap
division. A further 9 IC stu-
dents also qualified further
down the rankings.
Tim and Gray then pro-
gressed to the stepladder final
in first and second place, with
Kevin keeping up his good
form to take the fourth place.
In the Handicap section,
Trevor won two of his matches
to seed him 3rd in the steplad-
der final, whilst Jez qualified
in fourth.
Jez beat Trevor to a place in
the 2nd place match, which he
unfortunately lost and so fin-
ished in third, with a trophy
for the highest game of the
day (215).
In the Scratch section, Kevin
easily saw off his first oppo-
nent but was not good enough
to defeat Gray, who pro-
gressed to the final to meet
Tim. Four consecutive strikes
in the final frames saw Tim
come back and magnificently
take the title with a 189 game.
Tim also took home the High
Scratch Average trophy, and
Dany and Ally picked up the
Ladies High Game and Ladies
High Average awards in the
Scratch and Handicap section,
respectively.

The official Oxford Tour began
on a sunny, blue skied
Saturday morning. With a lit-
tle help from Anna's bacon
butties and Tina's not so dan-
gerous driving we arrived in
Oxford feeling ugly enough to
play the Oxford seconds
Despite the lashing hail
stones and fierce winds, a
recovering ankle and a bout of
viral meningitis among the
team, the IC "freezing ugly
bitches" gave the Oxford's sec-
onds team and a half a good
game.
The game ended 2-0 to the
mighty Oxford seconds, but
we'll have them next year! The
evening fun began with hall
dinner with Sunday's opposi-
tion, St Catherine's. We did IC
proud, and totally ruled the
dance floor, guys were falling
at our feet (no literally! -it was
that kind of night!). Chips and
garlic mayo ended the night,
unfortunately for Saz and not
so regrettably for others, with
Tina's night time companion
being a TV, which obviously
doesn't object to garlic!
Sunday's game was crazy,
with defence playing attack
and attack and mid field
mixed up all over the shop
(god we're such jokers!), we
pulled off a good score of 5-3!
After some not so delicious
shandies from St Catheriine's
we made our way home, via a
Guinness and some crisps,
and the weekend was almost
perfect!
We might not be ugly
enough to beat the Oxford
seconds, but we sure can
shake our toosh on the dance
floor!
