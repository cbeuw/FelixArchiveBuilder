Union Minibus Saga
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
After police investigations, it has
become clear that a vehicle invol-
ved in a 'hit and run' incident over
the Christmas holiday did not
belong to Imperial College Union
(ICU).
Police in Kent, called to the
scene of the incident, reported it to
the Union when their records
showed that the vehicle was found
to be registered to ICU {Felix 985).
The registration number of the
vehicle corresponded to that of a
Union minibus that had been
involved in an accident last summer
{Felix 974). The minibus had been
written off and so its ownership had
reverted to the insurers.
The insurance company sold the
remains of the van to a salvage mer-
chant. According to Kent CID, it
was then sold at auction to a buyer
who gave false details.
Unfortunately, these subsequent
owners of the van failed to register
their purchase with the authorities,
so officials could only trace it to the
Union.
The damage to the minibus
caused by the accident over the
summer was extensive. It is said
that the only part left undamaged
was the footplate at the back. It
seems most probable that the inci-
dent involved another vehicle using
the registration plates of the writ-
ten-off minibus.
St. Mary's Retirement
A formal apology has been given to
Brian Lloyd Davies by the Felix
News Team.
In a story last week we incor-
rectly stated that Mr Lloyd Davies
had resigned from his post as the
Secretary to the Delegacy at St
Mary's Hospital Medical School.
He had in fact retired.
In a letter to Felix, M r Lloyd
Davies outlined the main points of
his speech which we had incorrectly
printed. Mr Lloyd Davies said that
last week's article was "such a trav-
esty of the truth" that he felt forced
to write the letter to "put the record
straight".
In his farewell speech he includ-
ed criticism of the 'administration',
referring to the "second rate
Government" and not the College
as reported. Mr Lloyd Davies com-
mented "I mentioned in particular
the Government's petty and censor-
ial proposals for reform of Student
Unions contained in the new
Education Bill."
As copies of the speech were
unavailable at the time, the article
was based almost entirely upon
informal interviews with members
of College staff.
The reporter responsible
expressed regret that the facts of the
story were not checked.
Tube
Penalties
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
London Underground is planning to
introduce Penalty Fares of £10 in
order to combat fare-dodging. The
company has estimated that it loses
up to £30 million a year to the
cheats.
If approved by the Government,
the penalties would come into
effect from 3rd April 1994. They
represent the latest step in London
Underground's campaign to make
sure everyone travelling on the sys-
tem is carrying a valid ticket.
The proposed measures also
include modernisation of ticket
machines. In future, the machines
will be able to give out change
more often and will accept higher
denomination notes.
Nick Agnew, the man responsi-
ble for introducing the scheme,
commented: "We have to ask why
honest people should subsidise
those who deliberately...cheat the
system."
