Xerxes
Nicholas Hytner's celebrated English National
Opera production of Handel's Xerxes has
returned to the Coliseum in a revival directed by
Julia Hollander.
Xerxes was first performed at the Haymarket
in London in 1738. The composer was already in
the grip of his final illness, which explains the
extensive borrowings from earlier works that are
to be found in the opera. Nevertheless, the end
result is an integrated work which uses the con-
ventions of opera seria to tell a sophisticated
and humorous comic story.
The plot consists of a very tangled web of
love involving Xerxes, King of Persia, his broth-
er Arsamenes and their passionate ardour for
Romilda, the daugher of Ariodates, commander
of Xerxes' army. Also involved are Atlanta
(another daughter of Ariodates, secretly in love
with Arsamenes), Elviro the facetious servant
and Amastris, sole heiress to the neigh-bouring
kingdom and betrothed to Xerxes.
Got that? Well, things are further comp-licat-
ed for the audience by the fact that, in line with
common 18th century practice, the role of
Arsamenes was written for a castrato, that is, a
male soprano whose upper register was pro-
longed beyond puberty by castration. Nowadays
such roles are usually assigned to women, but at
Christopher Robson as Arsamenes and Louise Winter as Xerxes (photo by Justin Pumfrey)
ENO the part of Arsamenes is sung with haunt-
ing beauty by counter-tenor Christopher Robson.
Xerxes, on the other hand, is portrayed by a
woman: Louise Winter admirably embodies the
anguish of courting as 'all the ten thousand
Griefs, Impatiences and Resentments, that ren-
der a Man unamiable in the Eyes of the Person
whose Affection he solicits'. Outstanding among
the other members of the cast is the Romilda of
Yvonne Kenny who delivers with astonishing
vivacity and agility.
The slow-moving first act is more than com-
pensated for by the second and third acts, in
which the story and the true splendour of
Handel's music unfurl between dramatic
changes of set. The orchestra played magically
for conductor Ivor Bolton, complementing the
differing roles with beautiful precision. The mar-
ital fisticuffs in the final act are particularly
entertaining, although Handel's comic genius
was made aparent throughout the opera by
ENO's thoroughly enjoyable production.
