Opinion 23
Was It Fact
Or Was It
Fiction?
Dear Beccy,
I was surprised to open last week's Felix and
find out that I'd written a story ('Cat's Tale').
When I wrote it, I thought it was a factual article
about a strange American book on 'How To Get
Your Man' which I own, and about the effec-
tiveness of some of the techniques it suggests.
Still, what do I know?
Cheers,
Rachel Bassett

The Munster
by Samin Ishtiaq
Quite a few things can be said about the build-
ings at Imperial and not all of them would be
complimentary. (In fact, one interesting ideal of
mine would be to invite that Kirsty-whatsername
woman from BBC2's 'The Late Show' and let
her review IC's architecture.) But there is one
good thing: at least some of the buildings are
named after famous IC personalities.
Of course, the next problem is that not many
people know anything about these 'famous IC
personalities'. Ask an average IC undergrad who
Beit was, and he/she will probably reply: "Err,
aren't there 8 bits in a Beit?" So, here, exclusive
to Felix, is 'Samin's Quick Biographies of
Famous IC Personalities who are Remembered
by IC as Building Names':
Haldane: Probably the most unusual IC person-
ality, in that Haldane was a committed Marxist
and believed that science and socialism could
march on to solve all of mankind's problems.
(His death in 1964 meant he didn't have to face
the Prague Spring or the collapse of Soviet
empire, so he died in 'unrevisionist' peace.)
Haldane's interests lay in biochemistry and
genetics and, in the true spirit of science, he
would experiment on himself and his friends
(obviously, he lost most of them as time went
on). He suggested that, when colonising space,
man should have a tail grafted onto his back, so
as to lower his centre of gravity. Haldane's work
during the Second World War on the physiologi-
cal aspects of life in, and escape from, midget
submarines was used by the Library's architects
in designing the study cubicles.
Huxley: Not to be confused with A l Huxley the
novelist, Sir J. Huxley the biologist, or P.
Huxley my dentist. A medical doctor who taught
Road Kitchen
natural history at the Royal School of Mines in
the late 1800s, Huxley is known for his thoughts
on the place of science in society - all this most
unlike the traditional image of a miner.
William Penney: Mathematician and A-bomb
scientist. Worked at the Los Alamos Labs, New
Mexico and supervised the testing of Britain's
second A-bomb at Woomera, Australia [where's
that? - Ed]. (Interesting to know whether mem-
bers of IC's Environmental and Appropriate
Technology Society and The Australia Society
will attend lectures at the William Penney Labs.)
He is probably one of the few IC researchers to
have a playing field at the Atomic Weapons
Research Establishment, Aldermaston named
after him and to be made a Life Peer (Baron
Penney of East Hendred [and where's that? -
Ed].
Beit: Err, aren't there 8 bits in a Beit?
There are, of course, far more 'famous IC per-
sonalities' than buildings. H G Wells (a famous
school teacher) and IC's three Noble Laureates
are still missing a block of concrete with their
name on it.
An interesting question is how to get a build-
ing named after you. Obviously, you have to be
dead. Death gives you respectability and Mrs
Windsor can't come and take away your knight-
hood. (Remember the case of the 'Sir' Ronson
Gallery at the Natural History Museum?) You
should also have done something 'good', prefer-
ably for IC. So, while the Sir John Egan Aero
Building does have a chance, I suppose the next
building would probably be named after IC's
late Director of Car Park Franchising.
