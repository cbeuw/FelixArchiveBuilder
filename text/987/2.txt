Funding for social clubs and soci-
eties will be safeguarded under the
Government's plans for reform of
campus Student Unions, according
to Conservative Party officials. The
societies, which range from arts
appreciation to science fiction, were
facing a withdrawal of public sub-
sidy under the original draft of the
proposals published by the
Education Secretary last July. But
this week, the national chairman of
Conservative Students, T i m
Keavan, has confirmed that minis-
ters will implement changes in the
bill. These will save the societies
from cash starvation, but put them
under the direct financial control of
universities.
Mr Keavan, in a radio interview,
said that social societies will contin-
ue to receive public funding for
their activities, with this money
coming directly from colleges. This
is a change from the Government's
previous position where these 'non-
core' activities would be forbidden
from receiving taxpayers' money.
Mr Keavan, denying a Government
U-turn, said that these societies
would now operate under the finan-
cial control of universities, "free of
union influence". It is understood,
however, that political and possibly
religious societies w i l l remain
banned from receiving public fund-
ing.
"There is a fundamental misun-
derstanding of what the bill is going
to do. It will change what the stu-
dent union runs. The union will
have no control. What we are doing
is taking the money out of political
hands and giving it directly to the
societies," M r Keavan told IC
Radio.
Mr Keavan was unable to say
where this public money would
come from, but implied that it
would be part of the "block grant"
which each university already
receives for its union. He angrily
denied claims that the proposals
were part of a money-saving exer-
cise. "I will give you my assurance
now, as Tim Boswell [the higher
education minister] gave, that this is
not a cost cutting exercise. Funding
for social societies will absolutely,
categorically not be cut. This is not
my assurance - I have heard it
directly and publicly from the min-
isters concerned."
Mr Keavan, who will also be
interviewed by B B C l ' s 'On the
Record' this Sunday, denied that the
Government's plans were striking at
the heart of students' social lives.
"It is incredible when you hear the
NUS [National Union of Students]
saying that, without them, students
won't be drinking in the bar or hav-
ing fun playing sports or going to
the theatre. It is incredible arro-
gance for the NUS to say that all
student life revolves around them.
It's absolute rubbish and when you
look at the bill you will realise that
funding is not going to be cut and
more money will be spent on real
student services and no money will
be spent on silly little political
hacks," he said. The NUS president,
Lorna Fitzsimons, declined to com-
ment when asked.
The proposed reforms are cur-
rently being discussed by the House
of Lords. They have become the
subject of a widespread revolt by
Peers, who are alarmed at what they
see as new powers given to the
Education Secretary by the act.
In a mutiny of unprecedented
scale, Lords from all parties have
spoken out harshly against the bill,
and Opposition Peers are predicting
a Government defeat - despite a
built-in Conservative majority in
the Lords.
Lord Russell, Social Security
spokesman for the Liberal
Democrats and professor of history
at King's College London, told IC
Radio that the act was "one educa-
tion bill too many". He added that
the Government was planning a
range of concessions to placate
opponents.
He also said that the bill could
be challenged in the European
courts. His colleague, barrister Lord
Lester, has already been reported as
saying that the bill would infringe
the European Declaration on
Human Rights.
Any revolt in the Lords may be
matched by a similar rebellion in
the House of Commons, with the
former Higher Education minister,
Robert Jackson M P , leading the
opposition to the act.
Mr Keavan confirmed that the
Government was "consulting with
Peers who say they have doubts",
adding that the Government wants
the best bill for students.
Meanwhile, the Education
Secretary, John Patten, has been the
target of death threats from hard left
organisations. Socialist Worker
Student Societies in Oxford are
reported to have told Mr Patten that
he would leave a recent meeting "in
a little black hearse".
This follows an event last year,
after which Mr Patten complained
of his constituency surgery being
mobbed by "thugs" (Felix 983). He
condemned the latest incident as an
attempt to prevent free speech.
In another development, it has
been announced that the renewal of
Mr Patten's fellowship of Hertford
College, Oxford, will be discussed
at a meeting next month.
This month's UGM is today in the Ents Lounge at 1pm
