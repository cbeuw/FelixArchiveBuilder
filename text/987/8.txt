In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
Alif Lam Mim
These are Verses of the Wise Book
A Guide and Mercy to the Doers of Good
Those who establish regular Prayer
And give regular Charity
And have ( in their hearts)
The assurance of the Hereafter
These are on ( true ) guidance
From their Lord; and these
Are the ones who will prosper.
But there are, among men
Those who purchase idle tales
Without knowledge ( or meaning)
To mislead (men) from the Path of Allah
And throw ridicule (on the Path) :
For such there will be a humiliating Penalty.
When Our Signs are rehearsed
To such a one, he turns
Away in arrogance, as if there were deafness in
both his ears:
Announce to him a grievous penalty.
