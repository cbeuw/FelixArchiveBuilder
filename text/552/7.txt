B L O O D DONING
Yes, it's blood doning time again,
and the National Blood Transfusion
Service will be here o n May 20th
and 21st, in the Union Dining Hall.
C o m e along and save a few lives.
They need at least 320 pints (from
320 people). Preferably, eight every
quarter hour.
People who have had jaundice
are now eligible to give blood, if
they have not had it within the last
year, but people who have had
malaria, Kidney disease, diabetes,
epilepsy, heart disease, or tuber-
culosis are still unable to give —
also, p e o p l e c u r r e n t l y suffering
from anaemia, or any infection.
If you want to give blood, please
sign up on the notice in the J C R .
so that we know how many people
to expect, and to prevent bunching
and long queues. Alternatively, you
can just turn up on the day.
Please have something to eat
before you give blood, especially if
you are giving for the first time.
If y o u want a n y i n f o r m a t i o n
about blood (ie, what they do with
it), there are alot of leaflets in the
I C C A G R o o m (Top Floor, U n i o n
Building, near Welfare Centre), and
some in the J C R , by the notcie.

WATER
POLO
On Thursday 2nd May, IC I played
Lambeth II, away at Camberwell baths.
The game was the first round in the
plate of the London Winter Knockout
Cup.
Lambeth opened the scoring, in the
first minute, from a man up situation.
IC fought back with Phil Mills and Phil
Twaits each hitting the woodwork but
failing to score.
In the s e c o n d q u a r t e r IC t o o k
control of the game. Cliff S p o o n e r
taking two g o a l s and Phil T w a i t s
s c o r i n g from a tip shot. L a m b e t h
managed to pull back one of the goals
from a quick break.
By the end of the third quarter IC
had increased their lead to 6:4. Much
of the m i d f i e l d (pool!) p l a y was
was replaced by long, accurate (?)
passing from Costa.
The f o u r t h q u a r t e r p r o d u c e d a
superb goal by Costa from near the
halfway line. L a m b e t h then p u l l e d
back two goals to give a final score of
7:6 in favour of IC.
Unfortunately a handicap system of
eight goals denied us a game in the
second round.
