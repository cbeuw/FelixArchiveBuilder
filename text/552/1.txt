QUESTIONS ASKED IN
COMMONS AFTER IC DEMO
Following the demonstrations
by Imperial College students last
week there has been much
comment in the National Press
and questions have been asked in
the House of Commons.
Mr John Page, the Con-
servative MP for Harrow West,
asked "Who are these pro and
anti Ayatolla demonstrators who
are upsetting local residents and
generally turning the area into a
beer garden?
Are they students? Are they
attending to their studies? Who
is paying for them if they are
students?"

Jezebel, the motorised mascot
of the Royal College of Science
U n i o n , has h a d a very busy
b a n k h o l i d a y w e e k e n d . T h e
highlight w a s undoubtedly her
s u c c e s s f u l a n d t r o u b l e f r e e
arrival o n Brighton's seafront
after partaking in the nineteenth
a n n u a l H i s t o r i c C o m m e r c i a l
Vehicle C l u b ' s r u n t o Brighton.
T h e d a y started at the u n -
earthly hour of 4:00am. T w o
hours later, Jezebel was sitting
outside Southside, whilst h e r
crew ate their fill of the breakfast
being served in the R C S U Office.
(Many thanks are due to R a e
Snee a n d her willing band of
helpers). J e z then moved o n to
Battersea P a r k , the start of the
run.
A t her appointed hour, J e z
moved off followed closely by a
s t r a n g e l o o k i n g v e h i c l e , a p -
parently called B o , which h a d
c o m e along to wish her well. T h e
r u n t o t h e h a l f w a y h a l t a t
Crawley w a s peaceful, with a
surprising number of spectators
considering the hour!
A f t e r l e a v i n g C r a w l e y , t h e
spectators and traffic thickened
up. Things continued smoothly,
and the arrival o n the seafront
w a s g r e e t e d b y t h e P A a n -
n o u n c e m e n t " A n d n o w t h e
rowdy bunch are here. I don't
k n o w quite what the chanting is;
we'll have to try a n d find out".
Even after S e a n O ' B o y l e h a d
explained the intricacies of a
K a n g e l a , t h e a n n o u n c e r still
seemed totally bemused.
T h e rest of the day followed
the traditional pattern. A local
hostelry (not the Buccaneer)
was v i s i t e d for l u n c h , the
dodgems were visited for the
post-prandial entertainment. Jez
didn't win the beauty contest,
and the journey home involved
the occasional halt â€” usually
near a public house.
By midnight, Jez was safely
back in College and two veridcts
were announced.
1. A good time was had by all.
2. We wuz robbed!
TUC Day
of Action
London Transport Strike?
N e x t W e d n e s d a y (14th) is the
national T U C Day of Action against
v a r i o u s g o v e r n m e n t p o l i c i e s ,
particularly c u t b a c k s in p u b l i c
spending. One of the effects of this is
likely to be no public transport
available in London on Wednesday,
which is likely to make it impossible
for many staff and students to be able
to come into College.
Severed of the College trade unions
have jointly asked College to allow
their members to have the day off
w o r k in o r d e r that t h e y m a y
p a r t i c i p a t e i n m e e t i n g s a n d
demonstrations which are being
organised in London as part of the
Day of Action, and also so that in this
way the C o l l e g e c a n show its
opposition to cutbacks in university
education. The College trade unions
are hoping to organise a meeting in
College at 11:30 on the Wednesday
followed by a march to Central Hall,
Westminster.
The effect of the transport strike is
likely to be that many College servies
(eg, refectories) will not be able to
operate as normal, and it is hoped
that departments will make every
effort to rearrange lectures since
many students will be unable to atend
many students will be unable to
attend College that day.
For any students who must be in
College on Wednesday (eg, due to
ongoing practical work) and who are
unable to arrange an alternative to
public transport, the Union will be
providing camp beds in the I C W A
Lounge on Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings.
