Refugees
T h e extent of refugee problems in the w o r l d today is e n o r m o u s .
The U n i t e d States H i g h C o m m i s s i o n e r for Refugees estimated
that the world-wide increase in the number of refugees in 1978'
averaged over 2,000 per day. In Africa there are about four million -
refugees (one million from S o u t h e r n Africa); over half a m i l l i o n '
r e f u g e e s are k n o w n to be in E u r o p e a n d 1 4 5 , 0 0 0 in L a t i n
A m e r i c a . G l o b a l figures for A s i a differ enormously, but a quarter
of a million people from V i e t n a m arrived by boat on the shores of
countries in S o u t h East A s i a in 1978 and the first half of 1979.
The search for durable solutions
to these problems continues and it
is quite obvious that by providing
education in Britain for refugee
students we are only helping a
tiny n u m b e r . H o w e v e r , liberal
asylum policies by the industrialised
n a t i o n s a n d the p r o v i s i o n of
education for those refugees taken
in has to be a part of the attempt
to find an overall solution. There
must be recognition of the role that
refugee students can play in the
development either of their own
countries when they can return
home, or to other countries in the
same region. Providing education in
the industrialised countries is one
way in w h i c h this role can be
recognised. It is therefore important
that aid policy should not only help
provide education but also enable
those who have finished their
education to use their skills in the
poorer countries.
There is a particular problem for
refugee students. Although there is
Higher Fees â€” Who C a n Pay?
Specialised education in Britain has been available to thousands
of students from the under-developed countries. It is true that
until recently, little attention has been paid to the types and the
relevance of courses to the p o o r countries and their problems.
But the dialogue on the appropriateness of courses and training in
the last few years was initiated because there were students from
these countries in Britain.
A t present it seems that there is no change in the n u m b e r of
overseas students c o m i n g to study in the U n i t e d K i n g d o m but
there has been a change in the kinds of countries from w h i c h
these students c o m e .
a potential for them to contribute
to development it must be appre-
ciated that by the very nature of
their situation putting this into
practise is rather more difficult
than for the average o v e r s e a s
student. It is therefore essential
that one should not only recognise
the similarities in some respects
between overseas and refugee
students but also appreciate the
differences.
Refugees who come to the U K
to study will not be able to pick the
time or place to work after studying
as most overseas students can. As an
integral part therefore of being
given asylum in the U K and being
recognised as refugees they should
also be treated as British citizens
for educational and other purposes.
In addition therefore to a campaign
against differential fees for overseas
students, campaign work should also
demand the treatment of refugee
students as home students.
At present 68.4% of all overseas
students studying in the U K come
f r o m e i g h t e e n c o u n t r i e s : t h e
majority of these countries are not
among those listed by the U N as
the Least Developed Countries, ie
the poorest.
T h e trend since 1975 is that
fewer students have come from the
poorest countries and more from
the less poor. Although there are
no statistics available yet on the
