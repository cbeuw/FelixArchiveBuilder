WRITING
IN FELIX?
Just a
Prcssypiccc!
S o n o w the excitement of international
terrorism has died down a n d everyone
can return to their daily chores. I would
like to say that I thought a number of I C
students exacerbated what was already a
volatile situation by their rather immature
actions outside the Embassy.
Rents
T h e second round of discussions o n rent
levels for n e x t y e a r o c c u r r e d o n t h e
S t u d e n t R e s i d e n c e C o m m i t t e e , a n y
d e c i s i o n w a s r e f e r r e d t o a f u t u r e ,
unscheduled, meeting after the discussion
had ranged through the various extremes.
The basic proposal from College Finance
section is that rents be increased by a n
o v e r a l l f i g u r e of a b o u t 4 0 % , p u t t i n g
Southside Hall rooms up to £20.50, but
setting a triple in a Student H o u s e at £10.
B y revising the figures presented at the
Finance Sub-committee a n d introducing
economies in various areas it was possible
to counter propose an increase of 30%;
S o u t h s i d e r o o m £19.20, T r i p l e R o o m
£9.00. ( T h i s d o e s h v e to t a k e n i n t h e
c o n t e x t of t h e fact t h a t i n c r e a s e s last
December were avoided a n d replaced by
one-off economies in decorating). Neverthe-
less, 30% is a very high percentage when
compared with a 14.9% grant increase.
Further reductions in the increase were
pressed for but c a n only be obtained by
reconsidering the Evelyn G a r d e n s Lease
repayments which is why the meeting has
referred the matter back.
Wardens' Places And Re-Apps
T h e same Student Residence C o m m i t t e e
decided to recommend that the right of
Warden's Places be not included in future
Hall W a r d e n contracts. It also decided to
reduce the number of re-apps for the year
1981-2 to a set figure for each H a l l / H o u s e
giving a total of about 7% for the whole of
C o l l e g e r e s i d e n c e . T h e s e w e r e b o t h
proposed by the U n i o n reps in an attempt
to increase the number of students w h o
spend one year in a H a l l / H o u s e .
Meanwhile . . .
I a m c u r r e n t l y i n n e g o t i a t i o n w i t h S t
Stephen's Hospital Physiotherapy Depart-
ment, the Sports Medicine Foundation,
and the Health Centre, with a view to
s e t t i n g u p a S p o r t s a n d O r t h o p a e d i c

I brought up the point o n B o r e d of

interference in the revision over the last
w e e k a n d t h o s e w h o a r e c u r r e n t l y
involved in exams should have the events
at the Embassy taken into into account
when considering the results.
T h e last minute transfer of the Fete
i n t o t h e C o l l e g e c o m p l e x c e r t a i n l y
changed the atmosphere of the event but
the profitability seems not to have been
affected. Well done everyone w h o w o r k e d
hard to make it a success a n d thanks to
the College staff w h o endured the change
of venue.
W o r k hard, keep your nose clean, a n d
wash your hands.
