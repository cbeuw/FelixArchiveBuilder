IMPERIAL C O L L E G E S T U D E N T D E M O
Dear Colin
I wish to express my absolute
dismay at the spectacle I saw last
2nd
week in Kensington Park. It seemed
to me that a very substantial
number of IC students found
enjoyment in making an utter farce
out of an important, and potentially
very volatile situation. Not only
were they putting over their views
in a completely irrational and
disgraceful manner by jeering at
Iranian protesters, like some rioting
school kids, but they also succeeded
in drawing the attention of the
world's media in the process.
There is no better way to dam-
age the reputation of Imperial
Collge, than to display ourselves in
such a stupid, uncivilised and
ignorant way.
I am ashamed to belong to a
College, where more people find it
preferable to shout, jeer, and sing
inane songs about the Iranian
regime, than to bother attending
UGMs to formulate official, demo-
cratic and realistic college policy.
The fact that the 'RCS piano' was
also present, does nothing to
attempt to alleviate the problem,
but simply lowers those involved to
the level of their critised Iranian
counterparts.
Vburs faithfully

Dear Colin
As students of this college we
feel obliged to condemn in the
strongest possible terms the action
of various members of the Union
during the siege of the Iranian
Embassy last Thursday (1st May).
Their counter-demonstration
complete with piano and community
singing would have been a great
success in the Union Bar, but in
the circumstances betrayed a
complete indifference to the tragic
events going on in Iran and many
other parts of the world and to the
lives of those held hostage inside
the embassy. It has been claimed
that some of the policemen present
appeared to be enjoying the perform-
ance. These did not, however,
include those with the overall
responsibility for the operation
whose task of bringing the siege to
a peaceful conclusion was not
made easier by the irresponsible
attitude of the IC contingent. Their
action could have led to a riot and
their coverage on TV on Thursday
evening very probably led to the
presence of skinheads on the
following afternoon obviously out
for a 'bit of fun'.
On Friday afternoon a question
was asked in the House of Commons
as to who these "irresponsible"
counter-demonstrators were who
made the task of the police harder.
Are these really the type of
people who can be trusted to take
up responsible positons in society
in the near future?
Yours sincerely

In mid-afternoon after a false

in T e h r a n had been occupied,
students from Imperial College,

Friday May 2nd
There was an elderly lady of
amazing voice and astonishing
venom who bawled, 'Death to
the old bastard' as counter point
to every chant of 'Khomeini!
Khomeini!, and a drum-and-
tambourine procession from a
file of saffron-clad Buddhist
monks, suffling past as m u c h in
their o w n world as a drunk who
came out of the bushes, sang
' M a y b e It's Because I'm a
Londoner' ... and passed from
our view.
T h e n came more opposition
still, with the appearance of 100
s t u d e n t s f r o m L o n d o n
University's Imperial College.
Their banners invited: ' W a n t to
die for K h o m e i n i : T h e n drop
dead.'
T h e y gave us Jerusalem, Rule

G l o r y and then the football

Under the headline, 'RULE BRITANNIA! SINGING STUDENTS
SILENCE IRANIANS' they printed:
T h e rowdy mobs of Iranians
outside the besieged L o n d o n

sing-song.
It came from 150 mockers -
boisterous students from the

Dear C o l i n
That S o u t h Africa (SA) already has a
nuclear arsenal is disturbing, but the fact
that Imperial College might be responsible
f o r h e l p i n g t h e m t o d e v e l o p m o r e
horrifying terror weapons is unacceptable.
T h e growing development of S A ' s nuclear
technology has sufficiently worried United
States authorities enough for two S o u t h
African nuclear scientists to be asked to
leave the U S and this must point to the
gravity of the situation.
S o u t h e r n Africa is a destabilised area
contained a racist nation (SA), yet if you
read the Johannesburg press; full page
adverts leap from the print, offering you the
- BOMBS FOR THE BOYS? -
chance of an industrial sponsorship to take
you to IC where you will learn how to make
fuel for S o u t h African bombs ( C h e m E n g
M s c in Nuclear Technology). W h o is this
magnificently benevelont company, willing
to sponsor you in the quest for knowledge?
N o n e other t h a n the state c o n t r o l l e d
E S C O M (Electricity Supply C o m m i s i o n of
S o u t h Africa). Their aim? T o help the
development of nuclear technology in their
racist country.
If we allow I C to offer such a course to S A
students, apart from aiding S A to gain its
o w n ends, we will be directly contravening
U N policy on nuclear collaboration with S A
(resolution 33/183G) which calls, 'upon all
states to c e a s e f o r t h w i t h all n u c l e a r
collaboration with the racist regime and to
take measures to prevent such collabora-
tion by institutes within their jurisdiction'.
T h u s , in the interests of world peace,
the Apartheid G r o u p at Imperial College
calls upon L o r d Flowers to assure the
world that no S A students will be taught
n u c l e a r t e c h n o l o g y at I C u n t i l the
downfall of the abominable racist state.
W e further expect that all reasonable
students at IC will support this demand.
