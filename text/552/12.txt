Editorial
Those of us who witnessed the triumph of
the S A S at the Iranian Embassy have had
the good fortune to have seen a Great
British success.
T h e d e m o n s t r a t i o n b y I C s t u d e n t s
outside the Albert Hall could have turned
i n t o a d i s a s t e r f o r t h e r e p u t a t i o n of
I m p e r i a l . W e w e r e l u c k y to h a v e the
press on our side. They understood that
w e w e r e o n l y h a v i n g a b i t of f u n .
H o w e v e r , I felt u n e a s y w a t c h i n g the
d e m o , but it did give the press something
to photograph and took the steam out of
the Iranian student demonstration. I spent
a l o n g n i g h t w i t h the I r a n i a n s o n the
e v e n i n g of the siege a n d I d i d t r y to
understand their views.
In a n appeal to the British people they
said:
" W e are staging a gathering outside
the Embassy of the Republic of Iran to
show our solidarity with the captives
inside the Embassy and to express our
readiness to be exchanged with the
Iranian and non-Iranian hostages and

a l s o to p r o t e s t against the l a c k of
p r o t e c t i o n o f f e r e d to the I r a n i a n
Embassy while the British Embassy in
Iran is b e i n g fully p r o t e c t e d by the
Iranian authorities.
W e have been surrounded by the
Police and have been kept in isolation
from our other compatriots.
The Police have told us that our
stay here is legal. Inspite of our legal
status, the Police have refused food
and drink to be given to us and toilet
has also been refused.
T h e i m p r e s s i o n is g i v e n t h r o u g h
the media that we have been confront-
ing the British Police. W e vigourously
deny this and state that we are here
for peaceful purposes and our messge
is:
1. W e express our support of Imam
Khomeini and our solidarity with the
Iranian and non-Iranian hostages kept
in our Embassy.
2. W e express our protest against
the British authorities for not having
provided adequate protection for our
embassy in the first instance while the
British Embassy in Tehran has always
enjoyed full protection provided by the
Iranian authorities.
3. W e express our willingness to be
exchanged with the Iranian and non-
Iranian hostages kept in our Embassy.
T h e s i e g e h a s left u s w i t h m a n y
m e m o r i e s a n d for s o m e l u c k y p h o t o -
graphers images of the siege have been
r e c o r d e d o n film. S t u d e n t s w i t h g o o d
p i c t u r e s h a v e h a d v a r i o u s d e g r e e s of
success with magazines and newspapers.
Several have had their films scratched
a n d it w o u l d be u s e f u l if I c o u l d give
general advice to people with exclusive
pictures of the siege and future events.
However, a lot depends on the circum-
s t a n c e s . N a t i o n a l p a p e r s d o n o t w a n t
colour film because it takes a long time to
develop. It seems that going to an agency
such as the Press Association is a good bet.
A s t u d e n t p h o t o g r a p h e r w h o t o o k his
undeveloped black and white film to the
S u n was given back a very badly scratched
set of negatives after the Sun had taken
two good prints of the film. It may be
coincidence but several other incidents
imply that there is a trend. Papers wishing
to have exclusive photos arrange for the
film to be scratched so that no one else
will be able to use it.
If you do take colour pictures there is
still a market if you sell to the colour
g l o s s y m a g a z i n e s s u c h as Time, Now,
Newsweek and other Sunday magazines.
Y o u must move fast. If you have pictures
of the siege and haven't started nego-
t i a t i o n s t h e n y o u ' r e p r o b a b l y too late.
However, I hope to be seeing the Editor
of Impact magazine today, so if you have
any pics worth putting in an international
mag then c o m e to the F E L I X Office as
soon as possible.
Ironically, the Editor of Impact was a
hostage in the Iranian Embassy siege and
I hope to print an interview with him in
next Friday's F E L I X .
Apart from J e z going to Brighton, a
successful Rag Fete and the resolution to
the siege, etc, etc, a lot has happened to
distract the IC student from his/her hard
struggle to pass exams. Don't forget the
R C S A G M next Tuesday or if you're in
Guilds their handover on the steps of the
Albert Hall is o n the same day.
Rae has thanked everyone who helped
with the Rag Fete and I would like to
congratulate her on the success of the
Fete. I met an exhausted Rae walking
b a c k after the e v e n t a n d she s e e m e d
pleased with the response. The Barbeque
provided me with a welcome meal and I
w i s h we c o u l d h a v e t h e m m o r e often
because it is a good time to meet people
outside one's usual group of friends.
The Red C r o s s have been collecting all
w e e k at I C a n d a l i c e n s e h a s b e e n
obtained for tomorrow's street collection.
C o m e to t h e U n i o n L o w e r L o u n g e
between 9:30 and 10:30 to collect your
can and license. Y o u never k n o w when
you might need the R e d C r o s s . . . as I
found out last February. Their ambulance
rushed me to St Stephen's Hospital and a
R e d C r o s s w h e e l c h a i r h e l p e d me get
about. This week a splintered cue in the
U n i o n L o w e r Lounge meant that a pool
player needed swift hospital attention and
the R e d C r o s s were able to help.
This week F E L I X asks donations for
W U S . If you have given some of your
grant to W U S then I thank you. F o r most
of u s t h e T h i r d W o r l d a n d r e f u g e e
problems are more than at a distance
from our comfortable way of life. However,
several students have given up their time
to help collect your five pences for this
F E L I X and I a m grateful for their help. If
you would like to k n o w more about W U S
then turn to page nine.
N e x t T h u r s d a y , 170 Q u e e n s G a t e
opens its doors for another Beer'n'Bangers.
The event is worth attending and if you
want to go, see J e n by 13th M a y . O n
Wednesday IC may suffer from a lack of
activity during the T U C D a y of A c t i o n .
T h e day should have been named the
Day of Inaction, but that's been said so
many times before I should apologise for
writing it here. The day will be a forced
h o l i d a y f o r m a n y p e o p l e as L o n d o n
Transport will be at a standstill. I wonder
if T V will be cut? It will be interesting to
see how things work out.
N e w s is scarce during the M a y — J u n e
p e r i o d s o if y o u k n o w of a n y t h i n g
happening please drop into the office or
give us a buzz on Internal 2881.
I almost forgot to wish R C S success in
the T e n Tors this weekend.
T h a n k s to everyone who has helped a
rather tired F E L I X Editor this week. If
you'd like a rest from e x a m revision, why
not write an amusing article for F E L I X . If
you've got any good pictures that s u m up
t h i s y e a r at I C I'd l i k e to see t h e m
because a F E L I X review of the year will
be put together over the next few weeks.
Cheers
