Well, despite the Iranian Embassy Siege,
and numerous other problems (such as
the positioning of the stage directly i n
front of the Queen's T o w e r doors!), the
1980 R a g Fete finally managed to get
u n d e r w a y . A l t h o u g h t h e w e a t h e r w a s
somewhat overcast a n d chilly, the event
was w e l l a t t e n d e d , b y s t u d e n t s , l o c a l
r e s i d e n t s , a n d ' p a s s e r s - b y ' w h o w e r e
lured down from the nearby demonstrations
with the aid of 'Horrids' signposts a n d
sandwich boards!
I think most people w h o went thor-
oughly enjoyed themselves, as I most
certainly did — despite being 'hit' with
custard pies twice! M a n y thanks must go
to the large number of people w h o put in
a lot of effort to provide us with stalls,

Linstead a n d K e o g h Halls, Rayleigh (I
think!) House, the C C U s , C h a p s , Links
and the 22 C l u b complete with donkeys!
A l s o thanks to J a n e Lavers a n d Roger for
running stalls single handed; J a z z C l u b
for continuing to entertain us under b a d
conditions; I C Radio for providing the P A
system a n d the R e d C r o s s for looking
after the (fortunately minor) casualties.

publicity, a n d of course Annie for all her
help throughout the organisation.

I would also like to thank A l a n for
running the bar at such short notice, Bill
the electrician for being extremely helpful
and sorting out all o u r power problems,
and especially Stan, for getting us the
licence, a n d all his hard work persuading
sales representatives to donate goods to
us.
I think I've got to the end of the list
now, but if I've missed your name off, I
assure y o u that every helping hand was
greatly appreciated a n d was vital in the
success of the event — we've raised over
£600 at o u r present estimate, a n d will
release the final total when all the figures
are sorted out. A l l i n all I w a s very
pleased, a n d thought it an excellent finale
to a great year for R a g .

holiday weekend not that many people
were o n the float, b u t t h o s e p r e s e n t
certainty enjoyed the procession of about
eighty floats, most of w h i c h h a d a lively
'spring' air about them, a n d several went
back to Bishops Park afterward to enjoy
the Carnival itself. T h e credit for our float
is entirely due to M i k e Richardson w h o
designed a n d built it, with the help of
Dave, B r y a n , T o n y a n d other G u i l d s m e n
whose names I can't remember. It w a s a
superb job for the time a n d materials
available, a n d I look forward to seeing
their L o r d M a y o r s S h o w next year.
