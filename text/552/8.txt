pervades the current Iranian-American
conflagration of interests has received
exhaustive coverage in the media, as
should be the case. A n d what with the
present seige of Iran's L o n d o n Embassy,
w e i n E n g l a n d c a n n o w s m e l l t h e
s m o u l d e r i n g fumes of this p r o l o n g e d
dispute with our o w n nostrils. However,
the overall emphasis in the press has
been one-sided. T h e general tone of these
m u l t i f a r i o u s r e p o r t s , w h e n t h e y have
ventured from the purely factuai, has
expressed three things; outrage, at the
'barbaric' behaviour of the Iranian people;
bewilderment, in the face of what to many
occidentals is an entirely alien culture;
and anxiety, at the frightening possibilities
germane in the dispute.

The last point will not concern us here,
though of course it is of the greatest

individuals, we are impotent to resolve it.
The American-Iranian Conflict:
—Some Historical Perspectives —
Facets
The general reaction of the Western
media, then, has stressed these elements
of outrage a n d bewilderment, but has not
even attempted to balance its notoriously'
b i a s e d c o v e r a g e by e n d e a v o u r i n g to
understand the heritage, culture, history
and religion of the Iranian people. T o give
a detailed description of these facets of a
people whose culture is as rich as any
European nation far exceeds the scope of
this a b b r e v i a t e d a c c o u n t , i n w h i c h I
intend to raise just a few key points.
These will, I hope, explain in part or in
full the origins of the astonishment and
indignation with which Western m a n has
perceived the present turbulence in Iran.
Sandstorm
F i r s t l y , it s e e m s t o m e t h a t t h e
a p p a r e n t l y a n a r c h i c n a t u r e of t h e
revolution in Iran has blown up a swirling
sandstorm of riots a n d marches which
has hidden the extraordinary atavism that
has occurred there: namely, the fusion of
C h u r c h a n d State. T h e pattern of an
unchanging community with priests at its
head is the oldest of the great cultural
products of Asia. T h e sudden resurgence
of t h i s p h e n o m e n o n h a s , f r o m t h e
Western viewpoint, merely complicated a
political situtation that is as slippery as
butter. T h e statesmen of Europe a n d
A m e r i c a a r e u s u a l l y m e n w h o h a v e
grasped the reins of power from the
street, or more traditionally, from the
drawing room. In stark contrast, in Iran,
the G r a n d A y a t o l l a h K h o m e i n i s t e e r s
both the ship of state, a n d the vehicle of
religion, M o h a m m e d i s m . S u c h a position
of power has not been seen in Europe
since the declension of the Papal Empire.
Religion then, with its accoutrements of
morals a n d mores, is clearly a protagonist
in t h i s f a s c i n a t i n g e p i s o d e i n w o r l d
history. F o r not only are the nations of
Iran a n d A m e r i c a v y i n g against o n e
another, but, as I will go on to show, the
entire Weltanschauungs (world-views) of
these people are in oppostion; a n d where
there is conflict, there is friction and fire.
Central to a n understanding of the
people of Islam (which incidentally means
G o d ) is their genealogy. This stems from the
Sandskirt word 'ayra' (to which the words
A r y a n and Iran correspond) which means
'noble'. T h e Aryans originally inhabited
p a r t s of p r e s e n t - d a y I n d i a , b u t s o m e
migrated westwards, where they settled in
and around Iran, a n d later in parts of
northern Europe.
N o w , a popular misconception is to
associate the 'aryan' with 'master', when a
more appropriate epithet is 'masculine'. It
is here that w e see the c o n n e c t i o n
between the A r y a n a n d M o h a m m e d i s m ,
which, must rank as the chauvanistic
religion par excellence. Y e t there is a final
link in the chain, for we cannot but now
fail to correlate M o h a m m e d i s m with that
other patriarchial religion, Semitism. T h e
resemblances between these two need
n o f u r t h e r c l a r i f i c a t i o n o t h e r t h a n a
reading of the O l d Testament and the
K o r a n . B o t h stress the commandment of
obedience, of resignation before G o d , a n d
the importance of worship, prayer a n d
fasting.
Gloating
T h e D r a c o n i a n l a w s , w h i c h , f o r
example, demand the execution of the
offender on many counts, are merely
another facet of the Aryan-Muslim-Old-
Testament morality which permeates the
Iranian way of life. F r o m the Western
perspective, conditioned as we are by the
so-called motives of civilisation and the
Christian, N e w Testament doctrine of
mercy a n d forgiveness, the harsh brutality
of these punishments are offensive i n
principle a n d practce. In the same way, it
is now appropriate that C h u r c h a n d state
are once again united under a single
banner, for, as in many Muslim countries,
the covenant of M o h a m m e d is vigorously
u p h e l d b y t h e l a w of t h e l a n d . F o r
example, it is often the case that if a m a n
v i o l a t e s t h e edict of daylight fasting
d e c r e e d d u r i n g the M u s l i m religious
f e s t i v a l of R a m a d a n , t h e o f f e n c e is
punishable by law.
T o d a y , t h e n , w e s e e t h e I r a n i a n s
courageously refusing to be intimidated
by A m e r i c a a n d Russia, the Atlas and
H e r c u l e s of t h e w o r l d ; w e s e e t h e m
t h r e a t e n i n g to ' t r y a n d e x e c u t e ' (as
apposite phrase which crystallises the
a b s o l u t e n e s s of t h e i r s t a n d ) I r a n i a n
political prisoners if any member of their
L o n d o n Embassy delegation is murdered;
and we see them gloating like children
o v e r t h e i g n o m i n i o u s f a i l u r e of t h e
A m e r i c a n m i s e n t e r p i ise to free their
hostages. A n d it is more coincidental that
the G e r m a n s have a word for this kind of
malicious enjoyment of others' misfortune ..
. . . it is 'schadenfreude', or literally 'joy in
harm'.
—— Scourge — —
Nevertheless, before I end, I would
draw your attention to another prominent
feature of this crisis which can be seen
from a historical perspective. A n d it is
here that w e at last find a c o m m o n
element. F o r it is clear that both . the
A m e r i c a n a n d I r a n i a n p e o p l e h a v e
reacted in the same irrational way toward
their 'opponents'. In A m e r i c a , there is a
c o l l e c t i v e h a t r e d a n d d e r i s i o n of the
Iranian people, a n d , I daresay, the reverse
is equally true. Y e t , historically, both
countries are susceptible to this kind of
collective emnity. In the 1950s, we saw
every 'true' A m e r i c a n citizen respond to
M c C a r t h y ' s call to rid the country of the
scourge of C o m m u n i s m , while recently, in
Iran, there has been the same kind of
d e r a n g e d c o l l e c t i v e h a t r e d d i r e c t e d
t o w a r d s t h e D y n a s t i c r u l i n g - c l a s s ,
personified by the ex-Shah. B u t it is a
n o t i c e a b l e trait of p e o p l e with A r y a n
b l o o d i n t h e i r v e i n s t h a t t h e y a r e
particularly prone to this unanimity of
consciousness, for just fifty years ago, the
Nazis were the hunters, the Jews the
witches.
No panacea
Thus, the dispute between these two
nations is now no longer merely a political
q u a r r e l , n o r is it s i m p l y a m a t t e r of
a tyrannical S h a h a n d two score and ten
hostages; it has escalated into a bitter
conflict between value-systems, moralities
and religions. There would seem to be no
panacea to a dire crisis such as this,
where both parties feel aggreived a n d
w r o n g e d , a n d subsequently sense the
scales of j u s t i c e to be tilted i n their
direction. This seems to be particularly
true here because, as I have clarified in
the a f o r e g o i n g , t h e r e is n o c o m m o n
cultural or religious nexus between the
two peoples; as a result, there exists no
single impartial, higher power to which
these warring peoples could present their
respective grievances.
W e m u s t l o o k b e y o n d m a n - m a d e
i n s t i t u t i o n s o r t h e f r a m e - w o r k of
i n t e r n a t i o n a l l a w f o r t h e e v e n t u a l
resolution to this crisis; ultimately, there
is a l w a y s o n e u n b r e a k a b l e b o n d that
transcends all differences of belief, a n d
beneath w h i c h every individual, every
nation, is knit into a single family . . .
namely homo sapiens. It is the universal
l o v e of m a n k i n d , t h e p h i l a d e l p h i a n
instinct, that can a n d must dissolve all
barriers between Caucasian, Mongolian,
Slav, Indian, Negro a n d Aborigine.
