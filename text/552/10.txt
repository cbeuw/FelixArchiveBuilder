number of overseas students in
1978/9, the increase in costs for
that year, for the current year and
that predicted at current prices for
next year, bode ill.
The net result will only make it
increasingly difficult for the poorest
countries to send their students to
the U K unless compensation is
made through the aid programme.
It is not likely though, that the
T o r y g o v e r n m e n t will take the
initiative to assist the many students
from the Least Developed Countries
who c a n n o t afford to pay the
higher fees.
T h e effects of this are not
difficult to predict:
1. As the numbers of skilled and
highly educated nationals increase
in the richej countries, those in the
poorer countries will decease; the
gap between rich and poor countries
will continue to grow.
2. The gap between the rich and
poor in the poor countries them-
selves will continue to grow —
governments will not be able to
afford to s e n d as m a n y p o o r
students on scholarships while the
sons and daughters of the small
rich elite class in those countries
will still be able to afford the fees.
The Tory manifesto itself says
that the government intends to
" m a i n t a i n the excellence of our
higher educational system" and "to
help the poorer nations through
national a n d international pro-
grammes of aid". The only way it
can hope to keep these promises is
by allowing foreign and refugee
students to study in Britain without
imposing quotas of discriminatory
fees.
Small Projects
T h e need to encourage development education within the U K
student movement has long been a major concern of W U S . A s a
d e v e l o p m e n t a g e n c y w o r k i n g in the T h i r d W o r l d , W U S has

s o c i a l , e c o n o m i c a n d p o l i t i c i a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s a n d c o n d i t i o n s ,
particularly those which are responsible for under-development.
A t W U S , development education is directly concerned with issues
of h u m a n rights, dignity, self-reliance, and social justice in both
developed and developing countries. T h r o u g h programmes for
d e v e l o p m e n t e d u c a t i o n , W U S is a t t e m p t i n g t o e n c o u r a g e
involvement and action for improvement, and to break d o w n
a t t i t u d e s a n d m i s c o n c e p t i o n s w h i c h e x i s t w i t h i n the s t u d e n t
movement about the T h i r d W o r l d .
In order to encourage development education in colleges, W U S
selects three Small Projects each year which lend themselves to
campaign work within the student movement. T h e projects are
chosen because they represent the efforts of groups in Third
W o r l d countries to provide educational facilities as a step towards
self-determination.
Soviet Prisoner's Defence
To Be Conducted In
London
Important figures in the fight against
psychiatric abuse in the USSR will
appear in public at Central Hall,
Westminster, at 2:30pm on Thursday
15th May. The occasion consists of a
public defence of Vyacheslav
Bakhim, conducted by Louis Blom-
Cooper, QC, followed by a press
conference and public meeting.
Many people in the USSR are,
because of their opinions, im-
prisoned in hospital and forcibly
given unsuitable and harmful medical
treatment on the pretext that their
unorthodox beliefs constitute
insanity. There is in Moscow a
Working Commssion to investigate
the use of psychiatry for political
purposes; not surprisingly its
members are persecuted. Bakhim is
a founder member of the Working
Commision who is now in prison.
The purpose of Thursday's meeting
is to give him, albeit in his absence,
the public defence which he was
denied in his own country, and to
stop the spreading acceptance of,
and indifference to, the illegal
practices of the Soviet authorities;
for the keeping alive of better
standards in the rest of the world is
the Soviet victims' only hope.
Among those giving evidence will
be General Pyotr Grigorenko, who
was stripped of his rank and honours
and set to psychiatric hospital after
criticising Stlain; Vladimir Bukousky,
exiled dissenter; a British and a
Soviet psychiatrist; and a London
barrister, Brian Wrobel, who has
twice visited the Working Com-
mission. Charles Penman

Charlotte Maxeke Residential
Creche — Tanzania
Since the early sixties, an ever
increasing number of black South
Africans have been leaving South
Africa, fleeing persecuation. The
political turmoil in S o u t h Africa
during 1976 meant that even more
South African blacks fled South
Africa and joined the already large
South African exile population in
other African countries.
The Charlotte Maxeke Residential
Creche was opened in Junelast year,
in the small T a n z a n i a n town of
Morogoro. The aims of the creche
are many. It is essential that the
children's intellectual, emotional and
cultural needs are properly cared for.
It is equally important not only to help
the exiled mothers care for their
children properly, but to allow them
sufficient time to continue their own
education. There is also the need to
introduce the concept of child care
education to the black South African
community. It has always been a
struggle for parents to provide for
their c h i l d r e n ' s material needs.
Parents have been able to give very
little a t t e n t i o n to t h e i r y o u n g
children's intellectual and physical
development.
This has had a particularly bad
effect on slow learners and physically
handicapped children.
The successful operation of this
pilot project will do much to help
develop the concept of child care
education, and perhaps lay the
foundation for proper care for pre-
school children in South Africa in the
future.
Right now, the creche needs much
material support if it is to achieve the
goals it has set for itself. A list of
materials needed by the creche is
available from W U S ( U K ) who will fly
out all the materials collected by
participating groups to the creche.
Djibouti Library Project
It would be surprising if Djibouti were
well k n o w n . It only c a m e into
existence as an independent republic
in 1977, after 117 years as a French
colony. Although independent, it is
still tied to France.
It is of a country without any
industry or agriculture, the education
system is practically non-existent;
only eighteen D j i b o u t i a n s have
completed a university education,
and there are a mere dozen local
doctors and engineers, unemploy-
ment is above 50% and rising.
Since 1977 there has, however,
been a rapid influx of foreigners into
Djibouti; not tourists but refugees.
M o s t are s t u d e n t s , s o m e are
Ethiopians and others Eritreans.
In an attempt to alleviate their
plight, to ensure that where and
when their basic needs are met they
are not condemned to a wasteful
existance with no opportunity to
develop their mind, their potential,
WUS(UK) is helping to establish a
library.
There is a great need for English '
language publications (non-existent
in French-speaking Djibouti); some
periodicals have already been sent.
Once immediate needs are being met
it is hoped that provision may be
extended into education assistance
to the local population and the other
refugee groups in the country.
Educational Reconstruction In
Nicaragua
Following the overthrow of the
Somoza dictatorship in July 1978,
the Government of National Recon-
struction was faced with an enor-
mous task, not only in terms of
repairing the physical damage
inflicted on schools and other public
buildings by the Civil War, but also in
the need to provide such basic
facilities as education and health care
for the majority of the population.
Reconstruction of the health and
educational sector, therefore,
involves not just the rebuilding of
schools and hospitals, but the
launching of a campaign to wipe out
illiteracy, the training of local health
monitors to teach basic hygiene and
first aid, the installation of safe water
supplies and the construction of
adequate housing.
Rather than choose one specific
project, WUS(UK) is encouraging
local groups to support a series of
reconstruction projects. While these
projects refer mainly to the physical
reconstruction of damaged institu-
tions, they are an integral part of the
expansion and reorganisation of the
health and educational sectors to
provide basic facilites for the whole of
the population.
This year's Third World Scholar-
ship Campaign has so far raised
£1200. The target figure is £2000+.
Anyone with a few minutes to
spare on the afternoon of Wednes-
day 14th May is needed in the
Union Office to help WUS. If you
can not make this but are inter-
ested in WUS, contact Chris Fox
(Union Office), Tim Hillyer (Maths
3) or Mary Attenborough (Maths
PG).
Thanks for your 5p.
