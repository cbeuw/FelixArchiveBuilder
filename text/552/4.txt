Insurance
Following a n ad which appeared in the
last issue of Topic. I should like to remind
y o u t h a t w e h a v e a G r o u p P e r s o n a l
Accident Insurance Policy. A summary of
this is:
Group Personal Accident Insurance —
World Wide Cover
a) All students who are attending College
on a full-time basis or attending short
p o s t g r a u d a t e c o u r s e s are c o v e r e d in
respect of personal injury incurred during
the course of their studies;
b) P G students are covered 24 hours a day
throughout the year excluding the times
when they are on personal holidays or
vacations not involving their studies;
c) U G students are covered 24 hours a
day during term time.
d) Students do not have to be in college or
on college business to be covered and they
are also insured whilst on college or union
sponsored activities outside term time, eg,
field trips, sports tours, etc.
e) Benefits: Death £500; Permanent and
Total Disablement (graduated scale) £2000;
Temporary Total Disablement £10 per week
up to a maximum of 104 weeks from the
fifth week of disability onwards. Subject to
benefit not exceeding 75% of the claimants
average weekly income.
In addition, a maximum of 500 students
in any one year are covered anywhere in
the world, whilst engaged in university or
union organised sports, etc, in respect of:
(a) those benefits outlined above.
(b) medical expenses up to £1000.
(c) extra travelling expenses, due to illness
or injury of student, or close relative, up to
£6000.
Bikes
Again there have been recent instances of
bikes being stolen from College. S o d o
lock them up well, make a note of the
frame number, etc, etc. Furthermore, it is
up to y o u to take out insurance o n them
Bikes are exempted from most policies
including those possessed by the Union.
Y o u may be interested to know that
the Association of British Cyclists have
launcehed C Y C L E G U A R D — a simple
c l u b m e m b e r s h i p s c h e m e that entitles
cycle owners to comprehensive insurance
cover as well as many other benefits.
F o r the basic fee of £9.50 per annum,
C Y C L E G U A R D m e m b e r s w i l l a u t o -
m a t i c a l l y be e n t i t l e d to t h e f o l l o w i n g
insurance benefits, backed by two leding
insurance companies:
1. L o s s or damage to their c y c l e by
accident, fire, loss or theft to a replacement
value of up to £200.
2. Third party liability up to £250,000.
3. Variable personal cover up to £250
(additional c o v e r is available at extra
charge).
Membership forms are available from
local cycle dealers or by phoning 360-
9720.
I n s u r a n c e c o m p a n i e s ( s u c h a s
C U / E n d s l e i g h or N a t West) also offer Bike
Insurance. I a m not in a position to
recommend Cycleguard as opposed to the
alternatives.
