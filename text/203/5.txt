THE SATURDAY NIGHT
HOPS
I happened to be around last
Saturday at one of the weekly
hops held in the Union. The
gatherings, which are not unlike
a disorganised cattle market on
some occasions, fulfill a very im-
portant function in allowing col-
lege clubs to swell their coffers by
organising a hop. I wonder if
the people who come along are
also filled with a sense of pur-
pose. On last Saturday, several
interesting types were on view.
There was the long standing lad,
25 years old or so, who has been
here for five years. He is a big
drinker, but as safe as an eunuch.
Then, there was the would be
smoothie, very provincial in his
fancy coat with the red velvet
collar. He fancies himself, but
usually walks home alone mak-
ing a lot of noise. Some of the
innocent ones, who still believe
they can find true love at a hop,
were successful, but only a few.
Then there was the cynical on-
looker with other means of access
to women. He seems to like pre-
tending he is a psychologist. Still,
what matter the players, the
coffers of I.C. are filled.
SOUTHSIDE
There has been considerable
writing on the problem of South-
side these days, of which a not
inconsiderable part has been
based on misconceived ideas. It
is noticeable that the penthouse
dwellers have acquired one or
two high riding and low thinking
followers. Everybody realises
that from now on an ever increas-
ing amount of student activity
will centre around the halls of
residence and the Union hier-
archy aim to assure that com-
plete control of all student acti-
"vities remains within the student
body. The indirect and subtle
means adopted by the penthouse
dwellers are not obvious to the
average Union member, in fact it
is amazing how few people
seem to realise what is going on
Wake up, Southside, before you
find yourself in the same situa-
tion as U.L.U.
COMMENT
"I am not an irresponsible
person, like some around here, I
do not drink beer and I am never
seen drunk. Indeed, no ! I drink
wine at refined parties and stag-
ger home in the early morning.
" People consider me the
lesser of two evils, so they will
elect me," said Mr. Berry, shortly
before his election as President of
Ian Campbell had nothing but praise for I.C. Folk Song Club
and admiration for the club's " regulars" appearing on the same
bill on 10th March. He added that many London folk clubs had
few professional performers as good as I.C.'s offering.
It was unfortunate that this Hootenanny failed to get off to a
good start, mainly due to unfamiliarity in the use of microphones.
The evening did not in fact really kick off until nearly nine o'clock
with the appearance of Derek Hall, an artiste of many facets and
supreme confidence. This was timely for the Ian Campbell Group
was scheduled to follow.
" JUG O' PUNCH "
In view of the shabby treat-
ment they had received at a num-
ber of recent college appearances,
the Campbells arrived at I.C.
with some trepidation. But they
were soon made to feel as at
home here as at their own "Jug
o' Punch " in Birmingham.
Of radio and tv fame, the guest
stars came to I.C. after a stren-
ouous afternoon recording ses-
sion. For this reason they had
asked to be limited to one hour's
performance. However, as a re-
sult of the tumultuous welcome
that they received, they per-
formed for at least half as long
again, regrettably halted only by
the clock and the Duty Officer.
Connoiseurs appreciated this to
be one of their best-ever per-
formances, with less informative
chit-chat and more songs (includ-
ing a number of requests).
C L I M A X O F T H E Y E A R
The audience of 160 heard
more music made by Rod. and
Alex, Elvina, Sam Apeji, Colin
and Judy, the Wayfarers, the
Blues Group, and Kate and Roy.
Bill Clifton, the world-famous
" Bluegnus " authority, had been
expected to drop in during the
evening. We must now wait until
next term for him to promote
" Talking Beatles Blues " (—and
Bluegrass) at IC Folk Club.

U.L.U. It seems he was right,
good luck to him. Now he will
be too busy to worry about I.C.
Those amazing sex letters were
so obviously written by people
very lacking in experience and
judgement. What were they but
sermons by outraged churchmen
and invitations to free love from
people who are sorry they do not
have a nasty disease. Nobody
spoke a sensible word on behalf
of the majority of normal people
at the college. However it was
very interesting to notice that our
enraged churchmen seem to know
more than they should about the
physical side of sex. It seems the
sight of a woman's leg above the
knee sends them into a frenzy.

STUDENT EXCHANGES
WITH EUROPEAN
UNIVERSITIES
Session 1964-65
Any student who wishes to be
considered for an Exchange
Scholarship at one of the Euro-
pean Universities shown below
should apply to the Head of his
Department and also inform the
Registrar, 178 Queen's Gate, in
writing by Friday, 1st May, 1964.
1. Aachen Technische Hoch-
schule: Open to postgraduate
students* only from the Min-
ing, Metallurgy, Civil, Elec-
trical and Mechanical Engin-
eering Departments.
2. Eidgenbssiche Technische
Hochschule, Zurich : Open to
any post-graduate students.*

In addition to the Scholarships,
the College will make available
additional funds, mainly to assist
students to travel in the countries
they are visiting. Scholars will
"Women race to buy men a
present, and this race usually
ends in a tie."
What garment can possibly be
considered more fatuous than a
tie? What use is it? Was it
invented by the Society for the
prevention of Obscenity to Shirt-
Fronts, or the Clothe the Buttons
Fund : Why wear one, what sort,
and how ?
Why : Because it is supposed
to look well-dressed as it forces
you to close that sadistic top
button which usually succeeds in
half-peeling your Adam's apple.
What sort—well, you can either
plump for the wide type, which
is pointed at the bottom, and
often in College colours, for the
I've-got-an-interview and I'm-the
serious-type look, or else you can
be a man of the world, and wear
the Slim-Jim sort which re-
sembles nothing more than a bib
for three-foot centipedes. Have
you ever noticed that width of tie
seems directly proportional to
width of trouser-leg.
And when you've chosen, and
are holding a good yard of
coloured silk in front of you, no
training in the Boy Scouts will
help you tie it, what can you do ?
Well, if you want to look like a
politician, you must fix it so that
the knot is wrinkled, asymmetri-
cal and coyly trying to hide be-
neath your collar. On the other
hand (neck, rather) the modern
taste is for the smooth, well-
rounded knot which, depending
on the size of your tie, and your
personal taste can be achieved
with the Half-Windsor method,
reasonably quick and effective,
or the Full-Windsor, which is re-
portedly due to Prince Phillip.
K.I.K.
be asked to report on their use of
these funds on their return to this
country.
All candidates are required to
have a sufficient command of the
German language to be able to
follow laboratory and practical
work.
* Including those qualifying for a
degree in 1964.
