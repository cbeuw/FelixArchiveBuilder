The Union was transformed
into a blazing inferno, complete
with flame throwers hired from
Strand Electric. With The
Shadies in Hades in the Hall and
the shake. At eleven a temper-
ance eight called the Big Bonzo
Dog DoDa Band on the stand,
and Howard had fists with a
drunken drummer and a broken
beer glass. Howard was cut, and
the drummer ostricised. Mean-
while upstairs in the Upper Re-
fectory, Paul London was blend-
ing the waltz. As it was a Hades
Fryday, the chips and the fish
were served. The S.C.R. became
a rouletted Casino, and lounges
became Casa Sinners. Five Sara-
cens at Midnight did not approve
of the Hell like hissing after each
number; a practice originated;
earlier in the evening. The caba-
ret lived up to the theme. It was
Hell. The vicar was the soul
good element. Individual items
were original but often slow.
Cox-jones-king was good in part.
" This is you life Bob Schroter,"
a true documentary surprised
both Bob and the audience.
Likewise the length of the caba-
ret. The film projected us from
the Underworld into High
Society. At five to bed, and it
was raining in the morning. Well
done.
ENTS-WISE.
FABER PRIZE
The prize was awarded
jointly to D. G. Bishop for his
paper on " Synthetic Music," and
to L . D. Moss for his paper,
- Noughts and Crosses Mach-
ines." The papers were judged
by Prof. Saunders, the Dean, and
members of the Engineering
Society.
UNION MEETING
The Union Meeting in the last
week of February adjourned it-
self to the I.C. Debate, where it
welcomed the two visiting Ameri-
cans with a Boomalacka. The
meeting continued one week later
with the Motion, " This house be-
lieves that members of C. & G.
Union should concern themselves
more with affairs of I.C. Union,
than with the activities of the
C. & G. Union."
The motion was proposed by
Mike Combes, Editor-de-Luxe of
Felix, who studied the Halls-I.C-
Guilds triangle. Don Leeper, for
the opposition, gave a brief ac-
count of the history and tradition
of Guilds, and then pointed out
that the Halls could only cater
for a small percentage of the stu-
dents at any given time.
John Skinner, supporting the
motion, dealt with the status of
Guilds, and I.C. in technical and
business circles. Finally Pete
Airey urged the meeting not to
leave a thriving Guilds Union, to
join a dying concern. Let the
enthusiasm of Guilds keep I.C.
running.
The motion was defeated by
120 votes to 36, with 8 absten-
tions.
DEBATING COMPETITION
Last Tuesday saw the last
phase of the Intercollegiate De-
bating Competition, with Guilds
proposing that they would rather
be Bonds (James) than Beatles
(The). The Berry-Schroter-Hall
trio debated well, pointing out
that they would rather be a virile,
active two-legged Bond than a
mopped mobbed eight-legeed
Beatle. R.C.S. spoke also. The
motion was defeated, but Guilds
won the debate. Guilds also won
the debating competition, in con-
junction with Mines. There is no
official Trophy.

Carnival
1. CARNIVAL RAFFLE—
A N E X P L A N A T I O N
By now most of you will have
found your books of raffle tickets.
Judging by the number of queries
we have received, many of you
are puzzled by the rules—why
not have just a simple raffle ?
Answer—-it is illegal to have a
raffle prize of value exceeding
£100.
We decided that the best way
round this was to have the draw
in two parts.
1. A raffle in which there will
be 50 prize winners.
2. The competition for the
Cortina which will be entered oy
the 50 prizewinners only.
Demand for the tickets has
been, we are pleased to say, very
heavy, and we are having more
tickets printed; these will be
available by Friday. If all the
tickets are sold, the raffle alone
will make as much as last year's
total Carnival proceeds, so please
make a real effort to sell all the
books which have been distri-
buted to you.
C.N.D.
ON A-BOMB SURVIVORS
Today, Wednesday, I.C.C.N.D.
are showing the feature film
" Children of Hiroshima," in
Physics Lecture Theatre 2, at
1.45 p.m.
This internationally acclaimed
picture of Japan, 1952, tells the
story of a handful of A-bomb
survivors, mainly children, dur-
ing and after the dropping of the
Bomb, as seen through the eyes
of a young teacher, returning to
her native Hiroshima.
The film avoids the sensa-
tional approach and is free from
recrimination or bitterness. It is
intended to produce a horror of
war, not hatred of one or other of
the participating nations and it
has its accent on the future hap-
piness of youth.
There will be one or two short
supporting films and everybody
is welcome to attend.
2. CARNIVAL GARDEN
FETE
Side shows — stalls — round-
abounts — swings — fat ladies —
coconut shies — steam organs !!
All these we will be having at
this year's Carnival Garden Fete,
PROVIDING Y O U give us a
hand with building them.
If you can't aim a hammer at
anything smaller than your fin-
gers then we can give you a large
paint brush (and some elasto-
plast).
The more help—the bigger the
Fete—-the more money.
3. COMMANDOS
Coram ndos have set them-
selve a target of £1,000 for Carni-
val—ideas are needed—(do you
know how Yogi Bear, or Bill and
Ben, or anyone, can be kid-
napped ?)—for publicity stunts
and money raising stunts. We
already have some ideas—but we
need plenty of volunteers to put
them into practice—-at least 200.
So don't hesitate, whether it be
for commandos—stalls for the
Fete—raffle tickets—be a volun-
teer and report immediately to
your local recruiting office
(Carnival Office Weeks Hall)
offering your skills and ideas.
The Carnival Office is open
from 12.30—2.00 p.m. every day.
