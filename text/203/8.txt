OVERNIGHT GUEST
Beit Resident Evicted
Expulsions from the Halls of Residence are usually accompanied
by a certain amount of hysteria, and the circumstances of the crime
committed grossly exaggerated in favour of the evicted person; this
latest instance has been no exception. Within a few hours of the
dismissal from Beit it was " common knowledge " that the miscreant
had " simply kept a male friend on in his room for a couple of hours
after the Liston-Clay fight." Naturally, from this arose fears that
hostel regulations were about to be tightened up, that this poor inno-
cent was just a scape-goat in the cause of showing that the wardens
meant business. Dave Watson's statement that the whole situation
was much too delicate to be manhandled by the Felix Staff did little
to help eliminate the disquiet. The " scape-goat" himself, Mr. J. D.
Nisbett, seemed to think differently, saying the decision was quite
just, particularly as it was the second time he had been guilty of
this misdemeanour!
NO ALTERNATIVE
Of the disciplinary sub-com-
mittee of residents, three were in
favour of expulsion, the other
three thought that, under the
circumstances, some lesser pun-
ishment might be more reason-
able. However, as no lesser pun-
ishment existed, the Warden of
Beit, Mr. Frank Irving, could
only adopt the former measure.
This immediately raises the ques-
tion of whether there should be
an alternative measure; no one
has yet suggested a satisfactory
one.

WHO'S FOR ~
PRESIDENT I
Felix has been giving some
thought to the problem of next
year's president. Who is it to be?
Obvious first choice is Dave
Watson again who has had such
an outstandingly successful first
year as President; but rumour
has it he will not stand and some
doubt whether he would actu-
ally be eligible. It could be last
year's defeated candidate Dave
Loftus, if he has not by now lost
interest. Norman Price and Mike
Edwards are reckoned to be leav-
ing and John Preece will be on the
staff. Paul Carter when asked if
he would stand said " Like hell!"
but appearances can be decep-
tive. Felix Editor Combes has
had his fare back to Argentina
paid by the Union, and is un-
likely to come back. Most prob-
able man for the job—a complete
outsider.
Felix tips for other Presidential
posts:—-
C. & G.—Dave Bishop, rotund
juice-drinking publicity stunt.
R.C.S.—Graham Clark, big
and chubby but not actually
round.
Mines —- Nigel Kelland, well
known underwater man.
I.C.W.A. — Angela Taylor of
Felix fame.
PEDAL C A R RACE
Guilds Impress
BRISTOL
4.30 a.m. Friday 6th March,
alarm clocks ring over Beit and
South Side. The day of those ma-
chines that had been speeding
round Princes Gardens had ar-
rived. They were off for the big
race. No-one overslept and we
all left by 6.15 including oxy-
acetylene cylinders, taps, dies,
drills, spare parts, nuts, bolts,
spanners, hammers, two pedal
cars, 12 peddlers, 6 mechanics
and a girl-friend.
On arrival at Bristol, quite a
crowd gathered round the cars
Nos. 5 and 6. No-one recognised
them. 10.15 scrutineering suc-
cessful, 10.30 timed laps for grid
position—car 6 finished in the
front row but No. 5 was some way
down due to ignition trouble.
12.00 — They're off — car 6
streaks into a twenty yard lead
after one lap.—Nigel Wood not
studying the Bristol talent for a
spare minute or two.
The start was a fantastic sight,
46 cars of all sorts and sizes surg-
ing all over the track : crunches
galore, but great fun.
FASTEST IN THE FIELD
It was soon obvious that we
had the fastest cars but we hadn't
bargained for the number of
crashes that this would involve us
in. Spokes were ripped out at an
alarming rate and Jim Andrew
was soon at work doing a tre-
mendous job. in repairing them.
By 4.00 p.m. everything and
everyone had settled down, so we
livened it up. Ken Oldfield broke
the lap record by 13 seconds,
bringing it to 59.8 seconds. We
celebrated with our 2nd or 3rd
Boomalaka of the day.
THE NIGHT CLIMB
The night arrived, we all got
very cold, but our cars—" the
red devils" the crowd had nick-
named them—kept going lapping
every other car. Unfortunately,
the wheel trouble and an un-
favourable handicap were great
disadvantages. At midnight we
were positioned 16th and 17th.
Slowly we climbed through the
field ; by 9.00 a.m., none of us
having had more than two hours
sleep, we were 9th and 10th, and
at the finish 5th and 6th. Just
before this. John Gent and Nick
Walker both completed 200 laps
—nearly 40 miles.
This was a great weekend. The
spirit, the atmosphere and the
people made it like the real le
Mans. You can be sure that
Guilds will enter next year and,
with a bit more luck, win.
I would like to thank, in par-
ticular, Alan Oxley, Mike Lep-
pard, Jim Andrew, Mike Hutton
and Sid Cawson for appearing in
the workshop at 9.00 a.m. for five
weeks, Cyril King for letting us
use his workship, and all the
other peddlers and supporters
who made this venture so worth-
while.
