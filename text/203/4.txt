ROUND THE BEND
I must admit I don't like the
idea of writing for " Felix." When
you've got a large staff to report
and comment on College affairs it
seems silly not to leave them to
get on with it (within certain
limits which don't exist here any
longer) — and the " President's
Column " of most college news-
papers strikes me as a load of
egotistical bombast. But since as
far as the academic year is con-
cerned, we're now well round the
bend for better or for worse, I'm
going to have a fling. As is well
known, I've got a narrow con-
fined outlook on life, so, with
apologies, what I have to say may
have some connection with the
Union.
MOVING IN
Number one priority this year
has been moving into South Side
—the bottom floors, that is. I ior
one find the building extremely
pleasant, particularly the interior.
(The President and Secretary of
two years ago—Lyle and Stacey—
deserve great credit for their choice
of furnishings.) However, it cer-
tainly caused some headaches.
The biggest surprise, I think, was
to find that the main heating pipes
for the building ran through the
cellar of the bar—cost to put
right, £800. Again, the messengers
counter is just far enough from
the cloakroom to make it impos-
sible for one set of men to do
both jobs, so either we loose
coats or furniture, or pay a second
fortune—the building is a security
nightmare from start to finish with
more than twenty separate en-
trances. However, given a few
more paintings and a loudspeaker
system for telephone messages
etc., (both of which are in the
pipeline) the place will be just
like home.
REFECTORIES
Opening South Side caused near
chaos for Mooney (remember
those queues ?) and a thumping
loss was run up in the first few
months—we're still waiting to see
who is going to pay. Everything
had to be worked out again just
about from square one—working
times, staffing, costing. Incident-
ally, the relevant committee here
consists mainly of students, so
don't take it all out on our be-
loved catering manager. Believe
me, his lot is not easy—he gets
hammered almost daily for one
thing or another, and rarely a
helpful or thankful word. (Next
time you're organising a meeting
timed to finish at 6.30 why not let
him know?)
The basic reason for rather
poor service and high prices is
economic—the refectories have to
be designed and staffed to meet a
peak aemand which lasts for
about 30 minutes £o» about 30
weeks of the year. Mooney makes
the best of this with a skill which
at times verges on ihe criminal!
RUNNING OUT
The Union's financial resour-
ces have become more and more
strained with continued inflation
since our last increase in 1957.
So far it has been possible to
shield club activity from this only
by holding back expenditure in
other directions such as refurnish-
ing or filling the obvious need for
extra secretarial assistance, for
example. It seems, for a number
of reasons, that we have reached
the limit of this process, and if
we don't have more money by
next year even the clubs will begin
to feel the pinch. Negotiations
on this have been underway with
the Governing Body since last
summer in an attempt to provide
both short and long term solu-
tions—so let's keep our fingers
crossed.
FEUDMANSHIP
So much rubbish has been
spewed forth in print on the sub-
ject of a reported Halls/Union
row, that one hesitates to dive into
the refuse. However, the bubble
ought to be pricked; if it wasn't
for being reminded about this
row in each edition of " Felix " I
wouldn't know it existed. Came-
ron said much the same thing in
this newspaper last term.
Unlike Messrs. Williams and
Collins, I can't speak for " The
Union," and unlike Mike Combes
I'm not prescient, but certain
things seem self-evident:
(1) What the residents of any hall
do with their own time, energy
and money is their own affair,
and if the Union starts med-
dling in these matters it will
rightly be told where it gets
off.
(2) Likewise, vice versa.
(3) If a hall wants anything from
the Union, it will (and does)
ask for it.
(4) Likewise, vice versa.
So good luck to the hall footbal-
lers, cricketers, folk-singers and
what have you. Williams, Combes,
Collins, Annard et all should
either find a more profitable way
of idling their time away, or a
different hobby horse to ride—
try " Personal feud between Wat-
son and Massey " for a change.
UNION MEETING
Tomorrow's (i.e. Thursday's)
Union Meeting is the penultimate
hurdle for the modest changes to
the Bye-laws which Council re-
commended on an honest attempt
to oil a few joints. Watch out for
the people who will say " We
could do it this way or we could
do it that way, but we shouldn't
do it as suggested." What they
mean (but can't say) is that they
don't like the idea of a general
meeting electing a DeDutv Presi-

A
Above the inconsequentialities
and transcient sensations which
distract Union meetings, and sell
Felix, there persist some funda-
mental and enduring topics such
as the quality of the beer at
Harlington. By coincidence this
essential fluid is supplied by the
same firm which contributed sub-
stantially to the cost of extend-
ing the pavilion bar two years
ago. To verify that this charitable
organisation is maintaining re-
sponsible standards of production
the Griffin Brewery on the Crom-
well Road extension was recently
visited by the honorary inspecting
committee for wines, ales and
spirits at Harlington (HICWASH).
Although greeted deferentially by
Col. Fuller in person the dedi-
cated inspectorate allowed them-
selves to be detained for less than
• an hour-by his preliminary hospi-
tality, and were then guided
through the production processes
by two of the military maltster's
affable aides. Hops, wort yeast,
mash and the ladies of the bottling
section, were all critically ap-
praised.
HICWASH was concerned to
learn of the obstructionist tactics
of Customs and Excise, who
measure vat levels to within 0.1
inches, but was impressed by the
majestic stillness of the vast tanks
in the fermentation room. Here
the coloured glass windows,
(dating from its former use as a
Church Hall) create a suitably
reverent atmosphere. It was un-
fortunate that Inspector Cunning-
ham should stagger drunkenly on
this tranquil scene, but he had
cracked his head pa a copper
pipe in an excess of inquisitional
of Gravity
zeal. As a final duty HICWASH
assembled in a room curiously
termed the " Cage " to examine
samples of Vecent brews. The
Old Burton in particular (3/- per
pint) was generally approved, and
Inspector Havard arranged for a
small barrel to be supplied (at
cost) for his next important rugby
fixture. After conferring again
briefly on the merits of the latest
brewing of " London Pride " the
committee assented to a sugges-
tion that they might care to have
lunch before leaving ; but to show
that this would in no way influ-
ence their final report, took tins
of beer away for iurther analysis
on their return to College.
Ihe Athletic Ground Commit-
tee has since decided to continue
trie exclusive sale of Messrs.
Fuller's beers at Harlington, ior
the time being. When Uie next
of these arduous but necessary
inspections is due one trusts that
there will again be public-spirited
individuals prepared to undertake
the task without thought of
financial reward.

dent. Someone, I hope, will ask
which way they would do it.
Incidentally, the meeting also
promises some items of business
of a less esoteric nature. We're
not as bad as U L U vet!
