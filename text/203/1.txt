U.L.U.PRESIDENT
TO SERVE I.G.
WARNING!
THIEVES PROSPER AT I.C.
The number of incidents of thieving at I.C has now risen to a
very sinister and ugly all-time high. Nearly every day something is
reported missing and, in the vast majority of cases, there is no doubt
at all that thieves have been at work.
We seem to have passed beyond the stage of cushions and cutlery
being stolen from the Union ; such outbreaks of childishness are,
regrettably, to be expected of a rather immature mentality in every
society. What is quite inexcusable, however, is the blatant stealing
of money from people's jacket pockets. This would seem to repre-
sent a hideous sickness which must be stamped out for the good of
the community.
W A L L E T S V A N I S H
It is a frightful criticism of our
college that nobody can even
have money in their jackets in the
billiard room : wallets have just
vanished in the dim light. Money
must be carefully guarded in the
gym, for people have crept up the
back stairs, and disappeared
again without a sound. Jackets
cannot even be left for five
minutes on the tenth floor of the
physics building : again a wallet
has been stolen.
There is nothing casual in the
nature of this kind of stealing,
neither can it be attributed to an
outsider: the outbreaks are too
numerous, and the places so un-
likely.
Also, some of the incidents
seem to have a particular element
of nastiness. On March 4th the
Felix collecting tin in the Mech.
Eng. building was emptied be-
tween 5.30 and 8 o'clock in the
evening. The amount of money
missing, as yet undetermined,
probably represents the difference
between profit and loss on that
issue. It would be a sad reflec-
tion on the college if a number
of people had to miss lectures
simply to guard these tins. A n -
other revolting crime reported to
Mr. Jock Henry, the chief se-
curity officer, was the removal of
a cello from an obscure little
cloakroom in the Union. Is any-
thing safe ?
Mr. Henry also stresses that the
security guards have an impos-
sible job on their hands. They
cannot eject outsiders from the
Union, because students will not
carry their Union cards, and even
if they could, students would still
be leaving their jackets around,
albeit in apparently safe places.
The answer lies with the stu-
dents. If you take your jackets
off at any time, remove all money
and put it in your trouser pockets.
This applies to everyone, and to
every conceivable part of the col-
lege. Remember, you can trust
no one.
Will anyone who has
come to be in possession of
a metal plaque inscribed
" UNIVERSITY OF LON-
DON AIR SQUADRON"
please deliver it to the
Union Office so that it can
be returned (without any
questions being asked!) to
the owners.

Tony Berry carried the vote for the presidency of the U L U
against Frank Fuchs last week.
Both candidates in their speeches and answers to the packed
Council Room did credit to I.C. as a college producing thinkers and
actors rather than mere talkers. Frank Fuchs outlined his desire to
see U L U as the mouthpiece of its 25,000 students—and as taking a
leading role in national student affairs. Tony Berry threw
out ideas on student services, festivals, overseas students, 6th form
conference, and advance planning for U L U in the event of the Univer-
sity of London being split into several smaller Universities.
SARCASTIC
These speeches contrasted well
with President Anderson-Evans
report a sarcastic and fist clench-
ing little speech admitting failure
to run the Kennedy Memorial
Fund, in chucking carnival out of
U L U and failure to run an Edu-
cation Year March (remember
the anti apertheid March). Even
so the vote was carried on one
simple question—who won the
Hospitals Cup ? — Berry knew,
Fuchs didn't, and 15 Medic presi-
dents voted for Berry.
SERVING I.C
Asked his feelings on election,
Tony Berry commented, " I am
very glad to have this oppor-
tunity of serving—indirectly—'the
students of I.C.!" When asked
his attitude to restoration of de-

mocracy in U.L.U. Berry ex-
pressed his belief in a Delegate
conference for U.L.U. on a basis
of proportional representation,
e.g. I.C. to have about five dele-
gates—but with U.L.U. having no
say in the method of election of
these delegates from the consti-
tuent colleges. U.L.U. General
Meeting according to Tony Berry
is incapable of representing
U.L.U.'s 25,000 students due to
sheer weight of numbers. Alto-
gether it looks as if U.L.U. under
Tony Berry (already Chairman of
N.U.S. Athletics Committee) will
end up a little N.U.S — will I.C.
then disaffiliate ?
