F E L I X 3
d e a r s i r . . . SUPPLEMENT GEER?
Dear Mr. Michael Combes
editor sir.
So I read your last editorial,
and I immediately thought SEX
(I have to say this in order to get
this letter printed). And I should
like to raise a jew points. First
point; origin of GROT.
The word GROT was used as
far back as 1902, by D. H. Law-
rence, in his writings on the Brit-
ish Public, and following the death
of his Mother, it can therefore be
classed as a D.H.L. Four-Letter-
Word. In modern usage it can
be used as an adjective . . .
e.g. " Grotty advertising " or as
a noun
e.g. " A pile of Grot" or as an
adverb.
e.g. " The meeting was handled
Grotily " or as a verb
e.g. " He was Grotted on the
head," or as an expletive
e.g. "Grot you\ I" or conversely
e.g. "Grotl Grot\ Grot\"
Wot a lot of grot we got . . .
And Grotty Advertising . . .
Since I arrived at the College in
the dark ages of the Waterhouse
Building, the standard of adver-
tising has increased greatly. This
year, the best advertising has been
done by the Folk Song Group,
I.C. Dramatic Society (And last
year!), Wells Soc, The Carnivals,
Felix (even) and the S.S. Stomp,
for comprehensive coverage.
(Please Mr. Combes, check your
facts before printing Felix, the
stickers that you refer to in your
editorial were nothing to do with
the S.S.S., they were advertising
the U.L. Ally Pally Stomp). With
increasing advertising, comes in-
creasing need for display areas,
there are still places in the college
which are inadequately supplied
with student advertising areas.
Places such as Huxley, Elec. Eng,
Rod. Hill, and Physics., and
therefore organisers of functions
must resort to unorthodox sites
for their adverts, in order to
get a good display area. Good
advertising is an Artform, and in
a college of Technology such as
l.C, Artform should be encour-
aged. In the Socio-economic
state in which we live, advertising
plays a great role. Good adver-
tising within the college should be
encouraged, wherever it is posi-
tioned. Even Felix has found
the need to resort to Grotty
Advertising . . . sticking notices to
wooden stools, tables, black-
boards, even on grotty black tins
placed in the centre of walking
areas. Excellent advertising for
Felix . . . But let others be excel-
lent as well.
Yogily yours,
D. G. BISHOP
ED.: Bully for Yog! But the
Grotty Advertising (meaning un-
sightly) congregates in areas well
endowed with display space, viz.
Union entrance and South Side all
over.
ACTIVITY
Dear Sir,
Things have been happening in
Tizard Hall on a scale and in a
direction impossible to obtain
through the constituent unions.
I am referring to the visits paid to
Tizard Hall by several important
men in various fields, not neces-
sarily scientific. The non-scien-
tific men are, in my opinion of
great importance, as students can
only come in contact with them in
a non-academic, informal atmos-
phere in the Halls of residence.
Our union societies are in no way
brought into competition with the
halls in this field, as they just
haven't the same facilities. Peo-
ple who think that the Hall resi-
dents should not make the best
use of their opportunities, arguing
that these are detracting from
Union functions, atteiulences,
must fail to see the point. This is
simply that there is a large psy-
chological gap between strolling
down to the gallery floor to meet
somebody important, and going to
attend a society lecture in the col-
lege. Its also a matter of con-
venience for the student, like
switching on the television to see
a film, against going round to the
cinema. By bringing the activities
into the Halls, people who cannot
afford to make an evening of it,
manage to spare the hour or two
involved by attending small, infor-
mal meetings in Hall.
I remain Sir, unbrainwashed,
M. H. SOMMER,
Tizard Hall.
APOLOGY
Dear Sir,
We wish to tender our apolo-
gies for our very personal and
tomewhat rude comments con-
cerning the girls of Physics II,
which appeared in the last edition
of "Felix."
Yours sincerely,
The Long and the Short
and the Tall.
Poor Taste
Dear Sir,
I was amazed at the poor taste
shown by the writer of the second
Juke Box Jury Sketch at last
week's Smoking Concert. I refer,
to the carrying of Buddy Holly's
" coffin " across the stage as a
" personal appearance." Most
of the audience seemed to think
this highly funny, but it and the
beer marred for me an otherwise
reasonably enjoyable evening.
Yours sincerely,
R. S. ROBERTSHAW
(Phys. 3)
Dear Sir,
It is disappointing that not one
of your very critical correspond-
ents in the issue of 19 February
even makes reference to the ex-
cellent Electrical Engineering
Supplement in the previous issue.
This venture is, to my (perhaps
biased?) mind, only one outward
sign from the most forward look-
ing and progressive Department in
the College.
But, why should electrical be
the only Department in the Col-
lege to believe that the profes-
sional engineer of tomorrow will
have to solve human problems at
least as taxing as the technical
ones? I feel that engineering
students find humanities harder
than substituting figures into
formulae, which is why some
students do not " . . . seem yet to
be wholly " with us " in some of
these experiments . . . " (Sir
Willis Jackson). On this basis, the
most important parts of a degree
course at C and G are the funda-
mentals of engineering and hu-
manities. The most essential
feature of university teaching is
then avoiding" spoon-feeding;"
the easiest way to spoon-feed " a
student is to make him copy for-
mulae from a blackboard for three
years.
Yours faithfully,
J. LEWIS

DELINQUENCY
Dear Sir,
I should appreciate it if you
would permit me a little of your
valuable space to express a senti-
ment of my own.
I am not a fuddy-duddy or a
spoil-sport or anything of the sort,
and I admire healthily executed
rags or pranks or stunts.
I have watched males debagged
and females made to stand on
their heads without batting an eye,
butu when it comes to deliberate
destruction by violent means of
College fittings and furnishings, I
draw the line.
In a word that is stretching it
too far. During the ULU Rag
Week, no less than four of the
substantial metal handles, such as
those found on the refectories,
upper lounge and bar exit, were
wrenched off, not to mention
lock's and lamps destroyed.
I do not think for one moment
that these acts were perpetrated by
I.C. men, but I fail to see how
they could have been done with-
out being observed by some I.C.
when all good I.C. men should
come to the aid.
I think such acts are pointless
and puerile and should like to see
more of the " Mens sana in cor-
pore sano."
Thanking you sir, I am
Yours,

Dear Sir,
In the past Felix has been
known for its bad spelling and
grammar. I am happy to say that
this has improved greatly in recent
weeks. However, the extra-
ordinary lapse of Felix No. 202
forces me, much against my will,
to complain. I refer of course,
to the headline "It's Gear " to
the article about the Hyde Park
Road Relay. This sort of thing
can be tolerated no more. Anyone
who has ever lived within 20 miles
of Lime Street will know that the
expression should be "It's the
gear " and I hope that points like
this will be checked in future.
Incidentally, it is my theory that
the word should be spelt " geer,"
but not everybody would agree
with this.
R. A. WAFER (Maths I)
P.S. Would anyone interested in
forming a " Geer Society " please
contact me.
CRUDITY
Dear Sir,
At the risk of turning Felix into
a journal of sexual obsession, I
would like to add a few comments
to the " great sex battle."
I think that most reasonable
Christians expected that the letters
from the "angry virgins" would
precipitate the storm of protest
that followed. To dogmatise to
a readership which essentially
does not accept the basic premises
of Christianity, is bound to meet
with ridicule. After all, we are
often rightfully described as being
a post-Christian country.
However, dogmatism apart,
there is some cause for com-
plaint. Perhaps the two offend-
ing items in Felix came in for
harsher treatment than they de-
served; but I feel that a much
wider view is that many I.C. pro-
ductions regularly overstep the
boundaries of common good taste
(Is good taste a Christian con-
cept?) To mention a few which
usually offendâ€”The smoking con-
cert, the festival of music and cul-
ture, and of course Stynx. Sub-
tle suggestive humour can be
hilariously funny to an adult
audience, and at the same time
quite harmless. Crudity seems to
be the I.C. equivalent*. I.C.
scriptwriters seem to have mis-
placed the concept that humour
is intended to cause laughter, and
an enticement to vomit is often
substituted.
Could it be that one of the
underlying motives for the
bumper Christian lobby was an
early attempt to save Felix from
joining the crude clan?
Yours sincerely,
MIKE HOSKER
ED.: We're willing to be saved,
but perhaps a more subtle ap-
proach
