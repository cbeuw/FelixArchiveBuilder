BOAT CLUB
1-2-3
It was an unprecedented one-
two-three victory for the Boat
Club in the University of London
head of the river race. The 1st
VIII won the Dixon Bowl, the 3rd
VIII were second and the 2nd
VIII were third. In addition the
5th VIII won the Dixon Cup for
the fastest novice crew, their
overall position being fifteenth.
Starting into a strong head-
wind, ten seconds or so apart, the
crews had to face rough water
for the most of the course. The
1st VIII rowed well at 35 as far
as Hammersmith, where they
were only 1£ lengths behind the
U.L. 2nd VIII, the crew that had
started first. By Chiswick steps,
however, the I.C. crew was flag-
ging, and were further upset by a
heavy wash. This enabled the
university crew to get away again
and by Chiswick Bridge, the
finish, they were well clear.

BOXING
ATHAR EXCELS
Having been soundly beaten by
U.L. a few weeks previously,
Guys Hospital came in for
another hiding on February 28th,
this time at the hands of I.C.
Middle Weight
M . Neville-Polley (I.C.) was
mainly on the retreat but beat
B. Hartley with occasional attack-
ing moves.
Light-Middleweight
In a bout marred by the lack of
fitness of both competitors, M .
Philpott (I.C.) beat R. Knight on
points. Philpott appeared to
have a good right hand but was
unable to floor his opponent.
Light Weight
Both N . Athar (I.C.) and D.
Edgar showed considerable skill
and made this the best bout of
the evening. Athar eventually
beat his opponent on points.
Welter Weight
G. Thomas was the only I.C.
man to lose his bout. He was up
against a much more experienced
boxer in D. Gibbs but fought very
much better than in the previous
match.
QMC 2; ICOh!
A collection of talented individuals failed to hold a hard-work-
ing, well drilled team on the cold, windswept wastes of Motspur Park
and so the U.L. Challenge Cup goes to Mile End Road for the first
time ever after spending the past five years here in South Kensington.
I.C., with their seven Univer-
sity players, never really got into
their stride until the end of the
second half when it was all over.
It seems that three cup matches
have not been sufficient to pro-
duce a team understanding be-
tween these men who do not
usually play together.
The game began with the usual
probing and summing up between
the teams and twenty minutes
passed without a shot leashed in
anger, but with Q.M.C. getting
noticeably more of the play.
Then in a sudden reverse I.C.
were on the attack. A Crawford
lob into the penalty area was
hastily pushed back by a de-
fender to Winder, in the Q.M.C.
goal as Vaughan came charging
in down the middle.
FREE KICK
Two minutes later a Crawford
free kick from twenty yards out
went wide, then another Craw-
ford lob found Winder covering
well with Vaughan again coming
in fast. Finally a lovely cross
from Cox on the left wing found
Vaughan's head but the ball went
just inches the wrong side of the
upright.

WELSH WANDERINGS,ETC
At this time of the season it is
always difficult to turn out a full-
strength team; what with injuries
and the usual end of term chaos.
Thus on leap year day a small
team travelled over to Cardiff to
run in a new fixture against the
University, but even with the
encouragement of the captain's
girl-friend could do no better
than 2nd. This just about made us
quits, having beaten them in the
Hyde Park.
Following a cold, wet and very
muddy excursion up to Barnet,
where we beat Guy's but not
Bart's, came the Reading to
Mitcham Relay. This is a 40 mile,
8-man road relay run, usually
disasterously, by King's. This
years race—run into the teeth of
a sub-zero gale—was no excep-
tion: owing to a mix-up on the
last leg, (the blame and conse-
quences of which nobody cou'd
agree on) the team race had to be
declared void. Unofficially thovrrh
we came 8th—just behind Cardiff.
After that, play returned to the
I.C. half and soon, on the half
hour, Q.M.C. were a goal up. In
gram had come out to the edge of
the penalty area to collect a stray
Q.M.C. pass but was beaten to
the ball and could only watch as
it was crossed to the goalmouth
and forced in by Howorth past a
perplexed I.C. defence.
Q.M.C. should have made it
two when, minutes later, Ingram
could only parry a fierce shot but
the rebound was blasted inches
wide.
H.T. Q.M.C. 1 I.C. 0
Mary's started pressing again
straight from the re-start proving
that any superiority I.C. may
have shown in the closing minutes
of the first half was not to last.
Nine minutes later they were
awarded a free kick on the edge
of the penalty area—a short cross
into the middle and Howorth
headed first time into the net for
his second goal.
I.C. could well have scored
when Huxtable sprinted in to
turn a Stoddard corner kick to-
wards that vulnerable spot at the
bottom corner of the net, and
again when Casemore shot hard
from ten yards, but Winder was
equal to the occasion each time.
SCRAMBLE
In fact, the only time he came
near to being beaten was in the
73rd minute when a beautiful
cross from Huxtable was played
back on to the goal line by a
Q.M.C. defender and in the ensu-
ing mad scramble the ball ap-
peared to cross the line several
times. The whistle had already
gone for an I.C. foul, however.
With only 10 minutes left on
the clock I.C. at last began to
look desperate, but this did
nothing to improve their coordin-
ation and Q.M.C. free-wheeled
happily to the final whistle and
victory.

WATER POLO
I.C. have won the UX.U.
Water Polo League and never be-
fore has the standard of play
been so high in the college. Roy
Clark has played splendidly in
attack and goalkeeper John Ban-
yard has been the mainstay of the
defence.
JUDO
The Judo Club added another
victory to their impressive record
this season when the Ist team
went to Cambridge and defeated
the University by 2—1^, thus
completing the double over this
very strong side who had pre-
viously beaten Oxford 6—1.
BASKET B A L L
L.S.E. beat I.C. by 54-66 in the
final of the U.L.U. Cup. I.C.
found themselves up against a
well-drilled man-to-man defence
and never really got the better of
it. They suffered a severe set-
back in the second half when Bill
Steiger had to retire with a badly
damaged ankle.
SOCCER
Last issue's feature on Colin
Casemore stated that he had won
Bristol University Caps. This
should, of course, have read
British University Caps.

At this time of year ! The first
match ended in the narrowest of
victories for I.C. over U.C. with
Q.M.C. a rather trailing third.

SAILING
For the first time in three years
the College lost the Castaways

were responsible for the upset
