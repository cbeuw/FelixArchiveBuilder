Pigeon Fancier?
Dear Felix,
I had a thought. People who
know me often assume that
this is a time for me to reflect
on whether or not it is really a
good idea, but today I think
that I may be on to something.
Living in London one is con-
stantly bombarded with two
things: Requests for charity
and pigeons. M y thought
involved both. No, I am not
suggesting that we just give
pigeons to charity, oh, actual-
ly yes I am, but just think a
moment. How often have you
looked at one of those chick-
ens of the street and thought,
"hmm, if I could catch one of
those, I wouldn't have to pay
for my dinner tonight"? But is
it feasible? Like the good sci-
entist that I am, I did a little
research.
The average pigeon is
between 28-35cm in length
and weighs 227g. Removing
heads, legs and inedible inter-
nal organs leaves you with
around 150g of meat per bird.
It is estimated that 30 000
pigeons flock to Trafalgar
Square alone every day. Even
my rather dubious mathemat-
ical knowledge tells me that
that is a lot of meat. In fact,
that's 4500kg of meat that
could be put to a good cause.
How many people could that
much pigeon feed? Ok, so it's
not caviar but the French eat
horses and call it civilised.
Fair enough, so it's not a
great idea although I can
think of an alternative... The
average American tourist
weighs around 90kilos, now
removing heads and inedible
internal organs
that's...bloody Hell. Problem
solved.

The only problem I can see is
that some fool might decide to
farm the bastards 'free range'.
Pigeons, that is.
Recycling
Dear Felix,
I agree with the sentiments
in the article, regarding taking
an active interest in recycling
and environmental issues in
the world, and the intercon-
nectedness of many issues,
but would add a caveat: how
many of you actually know
what happens to the waste
you recycle, or what the cost
of recycling is?
As far as I know (and
please, if you know better, feel
free to set me straight), glass
and aluminium and can recy-
cling does produce a benefit.
Textile recycling, where they
are given to charities and re-
used, also seems to work.
However, paper and card-
board recycling, in many
cases, actually uses more pol-
lutants, such as bleaches etc,
to render the paper into a suit-
able state for re-use, and actu-
ally would have a negative
environmental impact.
However, the really shocking
fact is that although many
councils do provide separate
recycling facilities, and some
even collect, like the bin men,
a lot of the so-called "recycled"
waste ends up in the same
landfills as the rest of the
waste. I would be interested if
anyone knows more about
this, as my last info was about
2 years ago, and the situation
may by now have changed (at
least, we hope so).
Alex.

Dear Will
This is sort of a public service
announcement letter:
If your name is Lilly or Lillian
or something and you are in
the first year of studying
biochem (or something simi-
lar) at IC (Falmouth Keogh
hall???) and were knocked
over by a white car by the
junction of Exhibition Rd and
Some Other Road early in the
morning of 2/2/02 then I
stopped to help you. I certain-
ly stopped. Whether I actually
helped or not is something
better judged by subsequent
events. In any case I'd like to
know how you're doing and so
on because otherwise I shall
worry. M y email address is
idris.harding@ic.ac.uk and I'd
be grateful for some sort of
response.
yours, idris j harding
