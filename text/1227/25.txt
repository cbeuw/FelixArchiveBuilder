Not much space left for the usual rubbish I churn out this week, but
I hope you enjoyed the Simpson's Special. This week I had a special
request for an Indiana Jones Special, so here it is (don't say I never
give you anything).
Here at GFQQ :HQ we have received alot of correspondance about
the Moonraker Quote in the Bond Special (issue 1224), and I will
report the findings of our investigation in next week's issue. Enjoy!
