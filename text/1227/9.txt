Week Starts Here
bonus, if your team raises the
most cash you'll w i n four
Eurostar tickets to Paris or
Brussels courtesy of those gor-
geous people at STA travel. So,
travel London and you could
travel to Europe too - what
else were you going to do on a
boring Saturday? Stay in the
library?
M O R E BOOZE
There'll be rampant drinking
opportunities all week, if
that's what you're into, and
live music at the Union, if
you're into that too. On top of
that, you've got opportunities
to combine them both! On
Monday 18th Jazz and Rock
Society host a night of live
bands including the Rocking
Chairs, Urban Bongo, What
the Funk and Meantime in dBs
from 8pm. The very funky Jazz
Big Band will be playing their
socks off on Tuesday night,
February 19th, with their mix
of jazz, funk, latin and swing
from 8pm in the Union. Both
gigs are totally free, w i t h
donations on the door going to
the R A G charity and T-shirts
on sale in case your brain has-
n't let you do any washing
after Saturdays Pub Crawl...
FAST W O M E N
...and men will be racing down
crowded shopping areas in a
revival of the traditional R A G
Week sport - Tiddlywink races
down Oxford Street!
Wednesday will be one of the
money-raising highlights of
the week, with hundreds of
students out to invade the
street of London. There'll be
challenges for yourselves and
buckets to raise money for oth-
ers, w i t h the bonus of
Imperial's most bizarre event
starting at 2pm from Oxford
Circus Tube Station. It'll cost
you nothing to join in and
there are prizes for the best
collectors and free T-shirts for
everyone who raises over £50 -
an easy challenge for you high
achieving IC students, huh?
So make your Wednesday
afternoon something to
remember and get yourself to
the JCR from 12pm on the 20th
February and take up the
London Raid challenge!
FAST M E N
To keep in line with the
Union's equal opportunities
policy. I am obliged to write
about fast men too. These are
available at the C & G C U Slave
Auction, and infamous annual
event that will make its first
appearance in the JCR this
year. Sabbaticals will be on
sale, C & G officers, R A G Team
members and anyone worth a
bit of cash for charity! How
fast these men are depend on.
what you make them do I sup-
pose... I cleaned an oven for
£69 last year, but we'll not go
there today. One careful
owner, yours for 24hours, bar-
gains to be had in the JCR,
12pm, , Thursday 21st
February.
E V E N M O R E SEX
I though your attention was
flagging slightly there, so
hopefully I've got it for a few
more seconds to say that the
"Blues Brothers" and "The
Italian Job" will be at ICU
Cinema on Tuesday 19th and
Thursday 21st February. From
6pm in the Union Concert Hall,
you can see them both for the
same price as usual, donate a
bit of cash to the R A G charity
without even thinking about it
and enjoy two classic films
with your mates.
BIG ERECTIONS
Comedy title, sorry, it's getting
late... But still, the tallest
building in college is pretty
impressive, and does deserve
a bit of attention. RCSU will be
opening up the Queen's Tower
ton Monday 18th and Friday
22nd February and running
trips up and down all that's
left of the massive gothic enti-
ty that used to be the Imperial
Institute. I reckon it's there to
remind yourself what life used
to be like before concrete.
Trips are free on both
lunchtimes, and the views of
London are pretty amazing.
F R E E STUFF
Even after all of that, we still
have some freebies and very
cheap stuff to give away to all
of you beautiful people. You
can get 10% off at Snappy
Snaps photo developing on
High Street Kensington all
week, prizes and easy blags
could be yours at all the
events, and chocolate spread,
jam and peanut butter
RAGwiches available in dBs
all week for just a few of your
English pence.
Our funky R A G Week T-shirts
arrived in the office yesterday,
and my god, they are very
sexy! Just five squid for black,
red or green, six squid for
girlie ones. Or you can get one
for free by turning up at one of
the events above and raising
£50 for the R A G charity. Come
along to the stall in the JCR
every lunchtime next week
and get yours before they're all
gone.
Keep up!
The sparkling new website at
www.su.ic.ac.uk/rag will tell
you everything you need to
know about the latest events
and the charity we're doing it
all for, the Shooting Star
Appeal so please take a look.
Have a fun weekend, see you
all in R A G week!
