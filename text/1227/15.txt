Alt M u s Soc
Altruistic M u s k y
Socialists get slightly
pongy, as they redistrib-
ute the wealth of music
to the masses. Do you
see what I did there?
dB's, 5pm-7pm
Trivia
What did I have for
breakfast? This might
seem a trivial question
to you, but it's just the
kind of thing you might
be asked! Nothing. Ha!
dBs, 7pm-11pm
Cheesy Wotsits
What's that I smell?
Could it be the oh-so-
sweet malodour of both
cheese and slightly
over-excited sportmen
on the dancefloor? Yes!
Union, 8pm-lam
Comedy
Someone will make you
laugh, Natalie Haynes,
apparently. She's been a
teacher, but now makes
people laugh instead.
Definitely a change.
7:30pm-11pm
Valentine's Party
Drink and bodily fluids
flow w i t h abandon.
There'll be slag tags, a
message board, devils
and cupids, and all for
you and your love.
8pm-you fall in love

Mudholland Drive
New flick from that
David Lynch bloke - the
cult directors' director
responsible for Twin
Peaks and other things.
Unsettling but good.
On general release
Gosford Park
Also out at the moment,
and also unsettling but
still worth seeing, is this
new film noir by Robert
Altman. Although I'm
just going on the posters.
On general release
Black H a w k D o w n
This row seems to have
got a bit' serious for
some reason. This is
apparently about wars,
but I only know that
from the posters.
On lieutenant release
Contrary Nutter and
the Film's Bombed!
Ok, well maybe the
bespectacled Harry (not
to be confused with the
stoned one) didn't
bomb, but he must be on
the way out, surely!
Lord of the Rings
It's doing so well in cin-
emas, that we're men-
tioning it twice. I
haven't seen it though,
so maybe I should be
quiet, but it'd be a dull
square otherwise.
