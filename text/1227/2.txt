Council Comment
This letter was received from
Tasha Newton on Wednesday
evening, and due to print
deadlines, was too late to go in
the letters page. However,
since it is very relevant to this
week's issues, I have included
it here. Alongside it is my edi-
torial, to balance the tone of
this page.
'Watch out Sen we're going to
sack you'
Sometimes Union meetings
can be stuffed full of jargon that
makes regular students feel out-
siders. But last night, when a
council member officially
warned the President of ICU
that he was facing a motion of
censure, anyone could have
understood that Sen's job is
very much on the line.
As a final year who hopes to
leave IC in June, you would
have thought that I would have
simply sat back and laughed at
last night's farce of a meeting.
But sadly as a misguided former
Sabbatical, I care about what
happens to ICU, its staff and
students. I am especially wor-
ried that only the Sabbs' view
on what happened will appear
in Felix, so here's an alternative
interpretation of what went on.
Council was first asked to
consider a motion on whether
ICU should have a referendum
on joining the NUS. I'm sure that
that news will be covered in
great detail in Felix. There were
two sides to the debate, those
who felt it's time you, the stu-
dents decide rather than
Council deciding on your behalf
and those who felt that a refer-
endum would dominate the
forthcoming elections and exam
period, be a waste of money
and probably fall flat due to lack
of votes. (It needs more than 1.5
times the number of people
who normally turn out for elec-
tions!) In the end even Council
wasn't that convinced, only just
over half thought it was a good
idea and the meeting was
inquorate anyway. (Sorry, in
other words not even half of
Council was there, which
means only a quarter of Council
thought it was good.) The real
question is, why would Sen
want to do this to us? Could it
be that he worries that he'll be
finishing soon and won't have
done anything, that we won't
remember him? Or is he looking
for an advantage in the up-com-
ing election?
After this really bad decision
there was an amusing turn of
events as the President came
under fire for going to Felix with
issues before Council, for giving
up his duty as returning officer
(ah, yes, you see he does want
to stand again, heavens!) and
lots of other things I can't even
remember. Then he was told
that he should realise that peo-
ple are considering sacking
him. They weren't joking, seri-
ously, people were asking me
after the meeting if I'd sign up.
Well Sen, I think they're going to
remember you now, mate! Just
when the whole thing couldn't
get any more bizarre one of the
members challenged the num-
ber of people at the meeting,
quorum, there weren't enough
people so that was it, game
over!
Now I can't really comment
on whether Sen should get the
sack or not (although I can tell
you that people normally have
to be really, really bad for it even
to be suggested) because I've
been out the country for three
months and simply don't know.
But I can tell you that an NUS
referendum is a bleak thing.
There's gonna be a big fight,
and it'll probably be for nothing.
What you need to ask your-
selves is: What are Sen's
motives for bringing about this
referendum? Is he worried that
with just two Councils to go he
won't have done anything? Or is
it because he hopes he'll have
an (unfair) advantage over the

other candidates because he
can say he knows more about it
than them? He told Council last
night he doesn't care either
way, that he's going to be total-
ly impartial. But ask yourselves,
how can he be, when he wants
to be the President who will
have to deal with whatever the
decision is? Thanks, Tasha
Newton, (n.newton@ic.ac.uk)
And now... my reply:
While Tasha's concerns
should be considered, her own
motives for writing this letter
should be questioned. She is a
very vocal opponent to affilia-
tion with the NUS, and was
seen in council to argue against
affiliation very emotionally.
She seems to be under the
impression that Felix is written
by the Union, and this is possi-
bly because the relationship
between Felix and the Union
this year is significantly better
than that of her tenure as Union
President. This does not, how-
ever, mean that Felix is a vehi-
cle for Union propaganda, but,
in my opinion, this does help to
ensure that many of the news
stories are more accurate than
they have been in the past,
since the Sabbatical officers are
more willing to talk to, and give
quotes to Felix.
Interestingly, the Council in
question was quorate (did have
the rmnimum number of people
present), and was only
declared otherwise as a mis-
take by Council Chair Sam
Sharpe. Additionally, Mr Sharpe
has now resigned from this
post for academic reasons,
which means for the time
being, Sen Ganesh is Council
Chair. Conspiracy, perhaps?
Tasha also seems to think
that Sen having more knowl-
edge than other candidates is
an 'unfair advantage' when it
comes to elections. Sorry?
Surely if someone has more
knowledge, they're a better
candidate: that's what two
year sabbaticals are for. So you
don't have to teach them every-
thing again. A n d Sen clearly
doesn't control Council, so his
impartiality is not an issue.
Finally, Sen was warned with
censure, meaning someone
was warning that they were
considering the first step to
getting a bit cross with him.
This was because he had,
apparently, told Felix about the
fifth sabbatical before Council.
Which he hadn't. Felix discov-
ered that from an independent
source, and merely asked Sen
for a quote. So it seems to me
that Tasha has used this partic-
ularly bizarre Council session
as an excuse to cast a bad light
on a decision that was demo-
cratically made. Hmm. will
