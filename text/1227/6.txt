Holocaust Remembrance
"As I stand here before you, Judges of
Israel, to lead the prosecution of Adolf
Eichmann, I do not stand alone. With me,
in this place and at this hour, stand six
million accusers. But they cannot
rise to their feet and point an
accusing finger toward the man
who sits in the glass dock and cry
'I accuse'. For their ashes were
piled up in the hills of Auschwitz
and in the fields of Treblinka, or
washed away by the rivers of
Poland; their graves are scattered
over the length and breadth of
Europe. Their blood cries out, but
their voices are not heard.
Therefore it falls to me to be their
spokesman and to unfold in their
name the awesome indictment."
Gideon Hausner, Chief
Prosecutor at the trial of Adolf Eichmann,
one of the chief architects of the
Holocaust, in his opening address to an
Israeli court in 1961.
Last year, for the first time ever, an
annual memorial day was set up by the
Labour government for the millions who
perished under the Nazi genocide. This
was in line with other remembrance days
across Europe and North America and
coincides with the "march of the living"
through the concentration camp at
Auschwitz.
The Jewish tradition of "Vehigadeta
Lebincha" ("And you will tell your chil-
dren"), places a heavy emphasis on edu-
cating the younger generations about
their past and it is for that very reason we
see fit to remember the Holocaust. In this
spirit the Jewish Society, with the kind
help of college, set up a poster
Exhibition in the Sherfield build-
ing this week coinciding with the
national Holocaust Memorial Day.
The poster exhibition was also
aimed at giving some of the facts
and background to the Holocaust
as well as serving as a memorial.
Many people from different
departments around college,
stopped to have a look, to con-
template and discuss the exhibit
for a few minutes. The exhibition
also drew attention to the plight
of more recent victims of geno-
cide such as those in Cambodia
and Rwanda.
By preserving their memory, we are
ensuring that in some small way their
deaths were not in vain and hope such
terrible crimes will never be repeated.
