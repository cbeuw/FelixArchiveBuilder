Que pasa amigos? This weekend I've been living the 'high-life' in
Amsterdam, so I've tried to make a themed crossword to reflect my
experiences. I've also got a massive project deadline this Friday, so you
dirty jiz-meisters are lucky that I've managed to do a crossword at all.
This weeks winner is Louise Davies, Maths 4. Once again, all correct
crossword entries will be entered into a Playstation 2 draw in the last
week of the spring term. You can send your grids to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk
or drop then in at the Felix office in Beit Quad. We've been having some
ideas about the G F Q Q grand prize which we'll let you know more about
next week. Adios hermanos. Dr. Hot Fudge
