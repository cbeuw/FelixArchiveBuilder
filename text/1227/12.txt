naked men
Controversy-raising student
radio superstars Ben & Jerry
whipped up a storm last week
when they broadcast an entire
show in the buff.
The pair got in trouble last
term for use of explicit swear-
words which they defended as
being "in context".
While, admittedly, the pair
were discussing porn at the
time, the excuse for this
week's indecent behaviour is
less than flimsy. According to
IC Radio station manager
Steve Little, the sinful show
was to commemorate the 27th
anniversary of radio nudity in
the UK; pioneered in 1975 by
IC Radio. However, when Felix
spoke to Ben & Jerry, they
revealed that they had simply
exposed themselves "for a
dare".
The Naked Truth
Above, clockwise from top
left: N e k k e d a n d lovin' it;
Photo opportunity; smile for
the camera; boxing clever...
Rather than express any
remorse at their actions, they
revelled in their licentious-
ness, adding that they felt
"fresh like cream".
"It's like a brand new straw-
berry you bite into for the first
time," explained Ben, eagerly.
"Or virgin snow."
"Right!" interjected Jerry,
"when you piss into it and
give it that nice yellow stain."
Felix editor will Dugdale
described the whole sordid
affair as "disgusting."
