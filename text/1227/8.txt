rag week
Countdown to RAG
Seven days to go, it's coming
to a South Kensington campus
near you on Friday February
15th, and it's Imperial R A G
Week!
"Uh? R A G What? H o w do I get
involved? Does it include sex,
booze and fast women?" It's up
to you, really... For anyone
who's been spending too
much time in the library, on
the playstation or surfing the
internet, this is what it's
about...
R A G Week is the one week of
the year when everyone at
Imperial can get together,
have some fun and raise loads
of cash for charity. Most of the
events are completely free to
join in, and give you the
chance to do something com-
pletely different for one week
of the year! If you missed out
last year, or just want to try
something completely differ-
ent (whilst incidentally raising
thousands of quid for a good
cause), read on to find out
where you can get some of
that sex, booze and more of
those fast women...
SEX
-y school-uniformed students
will be running around the
Queen's Lawn at lunchtime on
Friday 22nd February, the cli-
max of R A G Week. 500 bal-
loons will be lifting off from
the Lawn in the big charity
balloon race, and there's free
squash and sweeties for any-
one who turns up in uniform.
From 1pm you'll have a chance
to get your own back on all the
Milkround companies that
make your life a careers fair
hell. Invade streets in the City
Of London and Canary Wharf
for donations from those rich
merchant bankers out on their
expense account lunches...
Mischief and childish behav-
iour will be encouraged at the
final event of the week when
R A G takes over the Union for a
Back To School Party!! Live
bands i n the School Hall,
cheese in the Home Room,
giant jenga and twister in the
Playground and vodka jelly
behind the Bikesheds, all this
will be a bargain £2 for the
best Union night this term
M O R E SEX
Aaah, Valentines Day,
February 14th, time to
romance that man or woman
in your life and make them feel
truly appreciated and cared
for. Or just completely embar-
rassed. Either way, for the
most memorable Valentines
gift ever given, you need the
Men of The World to help you!
For a round tenner, these gor-
geous boys will burst into your
loved one's lecture, sing a
romantic barbershop song and
present a long-stem rose to
your lucky lad or lass. Not only
a beautiful gift but also the
chance to waste a big chunk of
lecturing time. Book one now
by emailing rag@ic.ac.uk or
online at www.su.ic.ac.uk/rag
