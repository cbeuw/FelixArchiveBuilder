RSM Bottle Match Warm Up
February the 14th is a very
important day i n many peo-
ples calendar. A s you may all
know it is only t w o days to
the Bottle match, or as it shall
be known, t h e Valentines
massacre of 2002 where 15
Cornish inbreds shall meet a
sorry end. The mighty R S M
Rugby team "The best looking
team i n IC" - even more so
now that w e are missing "Sir"
Alex "the one m a n fashion
disaster" Fergusson due to
his bionic arm operation i n
the hope he c a n star along
side Arnie i n Terminator 3.
Anyway, R S M is n o w well
oiled, patched up w i t h a few
plasters a n d Enrico h a s
returned t h e Vaseline n o w
that has been utilised for his
sexual gratification.
The 1st home game of the
season and the return of M r
Nigeria s a w us u p against
the Streatham and Croydon
under 21 development
squad... If any of them were
under 21 then Italy will w i n
the G r a n d slam. Their
emblem w a s that of t h e
Penny Farthing, the principle
reason for this is that they
were t h e engineering team
involved i n the development
of the fine vehicle; w h e n that
failed, they turned to rugby. I
understand that the front row
helped Stevenson design his
Rocket! I n a n y case, t h e
opposition front r o w h a d
clearly been c h e w i n g o n
spanners all morning, a side
effect of w h i c h resulted i n
them a n d their companions
wearing the sacred black and
white hoops, this livened up
the proceedings and as such
the R S M Barbarians were
born. T h e resulting mish-
mash of colours upset some
of the R S M boys i n the first
few minutes and w e conced-
ed a t r y a n d some other
assorted points, despite the
Bigg Dave (note: b i g w i t h a
GG) tap and catch effort. The
African Intercontinental
break dance champion Flo,
fresh from a rendezvous w i t h
the anonymous N o r w e g i a n
bedroom gymnastics queen,
was unimpressed, a n d
responded w i t h t w o quick
tries assisted b y the Angel
Gabriel and M r Nigeria. Tim
suggested that t h e hobby-
horse w a s more technologi-
cally advanced than t h e
penny farthing a n d w a s
threatened w i t h violence.
Segun demanded that the tri-
cycle w a s quicker than both
and w a s hit by ugly geriatric.
Doug "dingo" Smith kept tra-
ditions alive by throwing up
on the sidelines as he has
done for every fixture. H u y
kicked the ball a lot - w i t h
style, whereas Ricky should
have been shot for his kick-
ing, t h e ball w o u l d have
made more progress up the
field astride a penny farthing
w i t h the entire R S M women's
hockey team precariously
balanced on the handlebars.
"Big Gay Mike", as seen o n
South Park, w a s doing a ster-
ling job running round the
park like a ferret up a drain-
pipe, until he became the vic-
tim of an unprovoked torpedo
attack from a U-boat some-
where up the Thames and he
was broken. Someone took a
shine to M r Grant's neck, so
he gave someone whiplash.
Half time struck, R S M were
winning, so they took t h e
pace m a n off i n the form of
the Ambo to give the opposi-
tion a chance. Flo fell victim
to cirrhosis of the liver and
sexual exertion b u t not
before claiming a hat trick.
Pez, the rotund Cornish wide-
boy w i t h the b a d beard and
his streamlined eyebrow,
went on, but he got a dead
leg w i t h i n the time it took Flo
to order another bottle of
£150 champagne. This set the
stage for t h e mighty
Yorkshire ripper: Steve "The
Executioner" Horrocks. Steve
stood u p to his name and
tried to decapitate a Zimmer
frame-bearing S & C player
immediately w i t h a forearm
smash and as such w a s near-
ly sent off. We scored lots,
they scored once and Segun
came off. There w a s a sus-
pected stroke from one of the
coffin dodgers, so Shags
went back o n as a traitor.
Doug went d o w n faster than
a two-dollar whore for a try i n
the corner a n d snapped
something. T h e game fin-
ished. No-one knows what
the score was, but w e w o n by
lots to some. Tim w a s M a n of
the Match. Dirty pints went
around quicker than a dose i n
a soho brothel a n d
Nightingale w a s a disgrace.
I've seen my N a n neck a pint
faster than him. We watched
the internationals and Ricky
told us all h o w he used to
play w i t h the Italian no.7... i n
the showers! Huy, hope you
had a good birthday, If any-
one wants to see some shoe
pie being dished out, book a
bottle match ticket today.
Bearing i n mind that the kit is
still i n N e w Zealand. If DHL
don't get their act together
then t h e mighty R S M
Barbarians might just be out
to play again. T h e Bottle
match will be screened live
on Cornish grandstand on the
16th. English rights are avail-
able to the highest bidder.
