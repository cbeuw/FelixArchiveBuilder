Netball-Tastic
Not more medics! In netball, 3
goals c a n be scored i n a
minute. That's pretty much
what happened w i t h
St.Georges. It w a s level the
whole w a y through, meaning
it w a s tough-going all the
way, no time for slacking.
Which isn't the easiest thing
on a Monday night. They also
wore the same colour kit as us
making it pretty confusing
stuff! But there were
moments of nice play. This is
where this team is so suc-
cessful - moments of textbook
netball that c a n only come
from experience!
We had cheesy chips for
tea. Jess turned purple, it
was brilliant. She got a bit
cross a n d shouted at her
opponent a lot. Ggrr. Beckie
as always stayed composed
and making a swift move at
the right time, a n d potted
some beauties (goals really).
Hannah w a s largin' it, but
went and hurt her ankle, poo.
Ruth h a d a scary defender,
very b i g girl, w h o remem-
bered her name at the end to
congratulate her - I think she
fancied me. Eek. Sooz was
defending her i n the last
quarter a n d w a s just as
scared but obvioulsy didn't
work the charm i n the same
way cos she had no such luck.
Kathryn and Clare, ah w e love
'em, no one keeps us as enter-
tained like Clare does! Ruth
replaced Ruth in the 3rd quar-
ter (tricky innit, perhaps I
should refer to us as
Ruthybaby a n d Stux) a n d

Kent have had an unbeaten
run i n the B U S A champi-
onships so far. We lost our
match away in Canterbury 3-0
last term so although w e were
looking forward to facing
them w i t h a n improved
squad, it wasn't without huge
doubts about our capabilities.
The first set was a close one
but w e lost it over the last few
points 23-25. Kent went on to
completely dominate the sec-
ond set, winning it 16-25. It
was clear that w e had prob-
lems i n reception but also i n
defence, w i t h inaccurate
blocking and poor coverage of
the court. These were all
symptoms of lack of focus.
We went into the third set
determined to w i n at least one
set. It w a s another close one
but this time it went our w a y
25-23. The fourth set demon-
strated w h y w e have a team
that can go all the w a y to the
last 8 at Loughborough. We
never lost our concentration
and w o n it 25-20.
The deciding fifth set was a
beauty. The fired u p Kent
team had no intention of writ-
ing a negative match report
for their polished website. Of
course, w e h a d the home
court advantage and by the
fifth we had inspired our fans!
It h a d a bit of everything,
backrow hitting, blocking,
desperate defence, diving, net
touches... It was a fight for
every point but w e were in
the lead from the start and w e
hung on to it to the finish,
with a 15-10 score.
The starting line-up was
Yannis, Jussi, Jeremy, Nicolas,
Nikolaos and Etam. Harry and
Marchetto (the shadow) sub-
stituted for Nicolas and Jeremy
halfway through the second
set and Ian and Michael were
always there for us.
played a stormer, as d i d
Claire w h o came on for Sooz.
Enough of the confusion, w e
lost by 3 pants stupid flippin
goals.
Southbank were far scarier,
the keeper had a constipated
look. They were a n arsy and
tetchy bunch, but no match
for the girls i n blue (us). It
wasn't a very consistent
game but it doesn't matter
because w e w o n . Our a i m
was to score a whole heap of
goals to strengthen our posi-
tion in the league table (we're
2nd i n BUSA) a n d Hannah
and Beckie, as always, deliv-
ered the goods. Southbank
arrived with attitude - ready
to claim a walkover because
we only supplied one umpire.
However, because of our
intelligent brain cells
between us, it w a s right back
at them as the rules say each
team must supply an umpire!
Ha! We w o n each quarter,
only playing our less-than-
textbook style in the 3rd quar-
ter, because w e were feeling
the effects of 2 b i g games i n
one week. No cheesy chips
this time, although Jess got
ggrr again at her Centre and
Sooz said a rude word, and
Kathryn whacked her oppo-
nent around the head, w h o
then lay on the floor being
concussed. It w a s a
Maradonna moment, a classic
dive, it can't have hurt that
much, the b i g girl's blouse.
H o w about Kathryn's hand
after the impact? It's all me
me me. Ruth
