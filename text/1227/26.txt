"Karting; it all starts in kart-
ing." That's what we're told
almost every time w e watch a
grand prix on the T V or read
articles in the press about F l
drivers. " A n d they usually
start at the age of four." Damn,
so that's most of us out of the
equation then. So what's the
next best thing? Well, if you
ask Michael Schumacher what
he does when he has some
spare time, I guarantee you
that somewhere in his list of
responses will be "karting."
Then you think, "he's a bit
werrd, he spends most his life
racing F l cars, so why would
he spend his spare time driv-
ing karts?". What w e must
remove straight away from our
thoughts are visions of indoor
circuits, stupid track mar-

bish 35 m p h rndoor karts. have organised the national
We're talking 80mph outdoor Inter University Karting
karts that reach 60 in about 3 Championship. For the first
and a half seconds. A n d then time ever the championship
you begin to understand why.
This year, the kart section of
Imperial College Motor Club
will be using the same karts
that Michael Schumacher
enjoys on his days off. So we
get to do 80mph, and we get
to do 60 in 3 and a half sec-
onds. What's best though is
that we get to show who has
the best student karting team
in the country and w i n one of
those karts for ourselves.
On Wednesday 13th
February Imperial's kart racing
team are heading up towards
Whilton Mill Kart Circuit for
the 2nd of two championship
test days to drive these ultra
powerful karts. We are looking
for a number of drivers to join
our racing team so if you think
you've got the talent, the
enthusiasm and the commit-
ment, and you wish to enjoy
some fantastic karting that
Wednesday, please email me
at will@iukc.co.uk and you too
could be racing for Imperial
College.
Good luck.
