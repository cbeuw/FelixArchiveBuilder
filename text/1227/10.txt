felix talk
HIV and AIDS affects us all.
When AIDS first emerged as
a disease over twenty years
ago, few people could have
predicted how the epidemic
would evolve, and fewer still
could have described with any
certainty the best ways of
combating it. Now in the year
2002, it is known from experi-
ence that AIDS can devastate
whole regions, knock decades
off national development,
widen the gulf between rich
and poor nations and push
already-stigmatised groups
closer to the margins of socie-
ty.
Already, 21.8 million people
around the world have died of
AIDS, 4.3 million of them chil-
dren by the end of 2000.
Nearly twice that many - 40
million - are now living with
HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, and most of these are
Chaplaincy
likely to die over the next
decade or so. The most recent
UNAIDS/WHO estimates
show that, in 2001 alone, 5 mil-
lion people were newly infect-
ed with HIV
Michael Sean Paterson in his
book 'Singing for our lives'
writes:
"Tell me it's not true ...
• That AIDS provokes feel-
ings of fear, ignorance, dis-
gust, hostility, rejection, mar-
ginalisation and prejudice
• That AIDS strikes at the
vulnerable - the African peo-
ples, gay men, intravenous
drug users, commercial sex
workers, haemophiliacs
• That those who live with
AIDS personally embody the
rejection of society hungry for
a scapegoat
• That people with AIDS
carry the can for all that socie-
ty cannot face to."
Sadly we cannot say that it
is not true, because we know
full well that it is true!
Sebi died last year from
AIDS. He was 9 years old. Sebi
was born in Romania and
infected when he received a
blood tonic' soon after his
birth. His parents could not
cope so they placed him in an
orphanage.
Johnathon also died last
year. He was 45 and one of the
first to be diagnosed with the
virus in this country.
Sadly some in the Church
still condemn those who have
the HIV or AIDS virus. They
condemn people for the life-
style that they live. But for
many Christian people this is
not the response that we
would give. So what should
our response be? Paterson
gives some responses from
people with the virus:
• We are living with Aids,
not dying of Aids
• Don't judge, but accept us
• Don't classify us into two
groups - the 'poor innocents'
and those who brought HIV on
themselves.
• Don't be frightened of us.
We won't infect you.
• Don't love me for Christ's
sake. Love me for my sake.
• We are looking for God too,
but not necessarily in the
places where the Church has
hidden him.
There are people and organ-
isations both on and off cam-
pus who are happy to discuss
any issues that may arise from
this article. If you would like to
talk in total confidence, the
Chaplaincy team are available

Inkwell - Condom Bureaucracy
In case you've been having a
more than active sex-life late-
ly, it might interest you to
know - if you don't already -
that free condoms are avail-
able from the IC Health Centre
in South-side. But, if you're
thinking of walking in, and
helping yourself to a generous
quantity...think again. For
there's a small catch.
A n d here it is: You have to
fill out a special form. Yes!
Something aptly named, a
"Condom Ordering Form". A lit-
tle piece of paper presumably
upon which you fill in all your
details; you know...Name,
Age, Sex, quantity required,
etc. After which you kindly
hand in your filled form to the
nice lady at the counter. I pre-
sume she'd check for any silly
errors you might have made.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bloggs"
she might say, "But could you
please be more specific? Is
that extra strong or regular?
Would you like it with or with-
out spermicide?" and so on
and so forth. After which you
turn pink, smile sheepishly
and say... "Busy weekend."
Now, of course since making
this startling discovery a few
weeks ago, the question-O-
meter in my head has risen to
critical point and one or two
questions have been flitting
within the inner walls of my
cranium.
First Question.. .Why?
Has Imperial College really
sunk to such bureaucratic
lows? One would have expect-
ed to see the little rectangular
packages lying lazily in a dis-
orderly pile in a small yet
accessible basket, such that
fingers could conveniently
swipe a few. Why forms need
to be laboriously filled is com-
pletely beyond me.
If this is the Health Centre's
idea of encouraging safe
sex...viz. asking you to pub-
licly fill out a "Condom
Ordering Form", no wonder
Britain has such a high
"unwanted-pregnancy" rate.
One understands the impor-
tance of keeping records et al,
but surely there must be limits
to bureaucracy, and this, in my
humble opinion is simply
pushing them far. Too far!
The second obvious ques-
tion is.. .Who?
Who on earth would be so
brazen as to venture counter-
ward, with "Condom Ordering
Form" in hand?
It brings to mind that rather
memorable scene from Ally
McBeal, where she ventures
bravely to the counter to pay
for some spermicide. Sadly for
Ms. McBeal, the till stops
working, and the insensitive
cashier chooses to announce
publicly over the PA system
for the price of spermicide. (At
which Ms. McBeal naturally
turns bright pink and cringes.)
I accept that ours is an age
in which there exists a sense
of sexual freedom and open-
ness, but Puh-leeze! Asking
people to fill out a form to
obtain condoms is not only
potentially embarrassing; it's
downright ridiculous as well.
