Two Worlds of Fashion, Complete Poles Apart

Fred Fyles visits The Photographer’s Gallery to see what’s trendy
"There is a
great deal
of contrast
at play in
Steichen's
work."
On 25th January, 1955, the
MoMA opened its doors to the
most ambitious photography
exhibition ever conceived. Titled
The Family of Man, the 503 photos
aimed to reflect the world around
us, highlighting the similarities
between vast numbers of people
who were just beginning to get their
postwar lives together, living in the
atomic shadow of Hiroshima. After
its wildly popular run in New York,
the exhibition toured the world for
8 years, building up a staggering
attendance of 9 million; in 2003 its
historical value was recognised by
UNESCO, who placed the exhibition
in their permanent archives. The
curator of this grand spectacle?
Edward Steichen – intellectual
royalty, Academy Award winner, and
one of the most influential fashion
photographers of his time.
Steichen is also the subject of a new
retrospective at The Photographer's
Gallery, who eschew his earlier,
pictorialist work, instead taking as
their starting point 1923 – the year
Steichen was hired by Conde Nast to
be the chief photographer for Vanity
Fair and Vogue. Over the next 14 years
he would revolutionise the fashion
photography industry, dragging it
blinking into the bright world of
modernism.
The series of photos chosen in
the exhibition are pretty evenly
split between portraits of famous
personalities and glossy fashion
spreads for the magazines.
His approach to composition
has helped form our idea of the
1920s, with his photos seeming to
perfectly encapsulate the bright
young spark that drove the motor of
this roaring decade. With the most
modern fashions captured against
supremacist-inspired backdrops,
the models seem to be archetypes
of ‘liberated women’ – from flapper
girls to grand dames, artists to
dancers, Steichen imbues each with
their own individual quality.
Steichen’s mastery of artificial
lighting means that each and every
photograph, although taken in black
& white, seems to have its own inner
warmth that radiates out.
His series of actor’s photographs
are equally as impressive; having
spent his formative years in New
York photographing some of the
most famous artists of the time, it
seems Steichen had long since lost
any trepidation that may accompany
photographing – that most intimate
of actions – innumerable stars.
These portraits of actors are early
precursors of the modern cult of
celebrity.
We have Joan Crawford, wrapped
in a black dress that drapes off her
body, haughtily looking down on the
world like an icy statue, her famously
expressive eyes downcast. Elsewhere
Marlene Dietrich, that most alien
of icons, is bathed in a soft glow; her
eyes turned up towards us, almost as
if in pain, and her hand outstretched,
like an opium-eater on the verge of a
come-down.
There is a great deal of contrast
at play in Steichen’s work, not only
between black and white, but also
between the clothing and their
environments. Particularly in his
early work the women are weighed
down with repressive clothing,
completely at odds with the modern,
almost Bauhaus-esque backdrops.
It seems that even with complete
control over the camera and the
scene, the things Steichen could not
control were the clothes themselves.
Some portraits, however, are
startling in their modernism,
particularly his iconic portrait of
Greta Garbo: dressed all in black, her
arms move up to push her hair back,
revealing her clear-cut cheekbones
and almost pallid skin. Her body –
ensconced in a turtleneck – seems
to dissolve into the bottom of the
photograph, while the two planes of
light play against her skin, pulled
taut against her skull. She no longer
resembles an actor; she is an icon
of modernity and death, a vision of
Bergman’s Nordic blues.
Moving downstairs, we find a
photographer whose work is the
complete opposite of Steichen’s:
Viviane Sassen, a Dutch
photographer who has forged
strong links with i-D, AnOther, and
Dazed and Confused magazines. The
difference could not be more striking:
while Steichen’s work is firmly
rooted in depression-era Hollywood
glamour, Sassen’s is unquestionably
contemporary; while Steichen relied
on traditional techniques of black
& white silver-gelatin plates, Sassen
is happy to mess around with new
perspectives, digital techniques,
and photoshop; and while Steichen
harnesses complete control over
the multitude of greys that exist
between both ends of the spectrum,
Sassen’s eye-popping works are
hypersaturated in vibrant, exuberant
colour.
What sets Sassen apart from her
peers is her meticulous eye for detail,
and a bold willingness to shift the
focus away from clothes, instead
following her own singular vision.
Some photographs have elements of
surrealism, where dresses resemble
"He would

modernism."
triffid-like blooms as opposed to
clothing; others see Sassen marrying
sartorial realness with a sense of body
horror, like the twisted offspring of
David Cronenberg and Guy Bourdin.
Her irreverent and humourful
attitude to fashion is clear: ‘for me,
fashion is one big playground, a place
to experiment’.
Unfortunately, her work is not
given the opportunity to shine that
it so sorely deserves. Taking on a
more conceptual form than the
Steichen collection, Analemma is
exhibited as a 45 minute film, in
which 350 pictures are run on a
loop while a minimal soundtrack
plays in the background. While
presenting content in such a way
is certainly novel, and allows us to
really get an idea of the key themes
in Sassen’s work, it doesn’t allow us
to experience its full breadth. It also
means that we are not allowed to
spend long lingering over a picture
we particularly love, or skip those one
finds boring; they all move past us at
the same meandering speed.
The Photographer’s Gallery does
very well to pull off these two shows,
highlighting a discipline that is
much maligned in mainstream
artistic culture. By showing us two
ends of fashion photography’s
timeline, the viewer is able to chart
the development of the form, from
a medium focussed purely on selling
overpriced clothes to one that
celebrates the artist’s vision and skill,
while still trying to sell overpriced
clothes. I guess some things never
change.
