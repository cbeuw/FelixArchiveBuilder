Imperial iGEM team come second in the world
The International Genetically
Engineered Machine (iGEM)
competition saw our own
Imperial team receive a number of
awards at the Global Jamboree this
week. The competition sees teams
from hundreds of Universities
bioengineer products using synthetic
biology techniques and pits their
ideas against each other in a giant
conference held in the USA.
The Global Jamboree, held in
Boston, Massachusetts, took place
last week from October 30th
to November the 3rd, and 245
University teams took part. It marked
the tenth anniversary of the iGEM
competition.
Universities from all over the world
enter the competition; there were 82
teams from Asia, 67 from Europe, 14
from Latin America and 84 teams
from North America.
Imperial’s team won multiple
prizes including Best Part Collection
(that recognised the use of additional
elements that are added to products,
like fluorescent or metal elements),
Best Manufacturing Project, and are
were finalists in the Undergraduate
category; they came number two
in the World, second to a team
in Germany, Heidelberg, which
presented a “highly technical” project
on proteins.
The Imperial iGEM 2014 team
project, called Aqualose, consisted
of Undergraduates from various
departments across Imperial. The
team of nine students and their
supervisor, Ben Reeve, a PhD student,
overseen by the Centre of Synthetic
Biology and Innovation, spent the
summer in the lab working on their
project, and then pitched their idea
at the Jamboree in front of the other
competing teams.
The team focused on manipulating
bacterial cellulose to produce water
filter membranes. Upon genetically
modifying Escherichia coli to produce
the bacterial cellulose, they were
able to mass-produce the cellulose
that could be used to augment water
recycling on a local and industrial
scale. They modified the cellulose
with binding proteins, allowing
different contaminants to be filtered
out of water as needed.
The Imperial teams have
traditionally done very well in the
past in the iGEM competition, with
the team last year reaching the final
stages and coming second runners
up. The 2011 team were the European
champions, and came in as the first
runners up overall.
Dr Tom Ellis, a Senior Lecturer
in the Centre for Synthetic Biology
and Innovation and a Supervisor of
the team, “The team were great to
work with and work incredibly hard,
considering all their big results came
in the last two months.
“They put in an amazing amount
of time and effort over the summer.
They were so enthusiastic and kept
smiling the entire time.”
“They were working with a tangible
product you could hold in your hand,
and this was handed out during the
presentation at Boston, which was
exciting. We are very proud of their
success.”
Felix spoke to two of the team
members: Michael Florea who studies
Biology, and Gabriella Santosa who
studies Biochemistry. Michael told
us about how they came up with the
idea.
“We started the project in July,
and spent about three weeks
brainstorming ideas. We had three
main ideas, and our supervisor helped
us pick one that really fit with the
criteria of the competition.
We finally set on an idea everyone
was happy with, and one that was
feasible in the time scale we had.”
Gabriella said: “One of the big
ideas behind iGEM and one that is
important at Imperial too is ‘Saving
the World’. We wanted to develop an
idea that is accessible to people and
something people on the street would
appreciate.”
Of their trip to Boston, Michael
told us how the work didn’t stop once
they arrived. “We arrived during
Halloween and managed to squeeze
in a party then!
“We also spoke to a lot of other
teams there and it was great to be able
to discuss ideas.”
The iGEM Giant Jamboree
marked the tenth anniversary of the
competition, and allowed all teams
from all stages of the competition to
attend. In previous years, only those
that pass a regional round make it to
the Boston conference.
Gabriella told us, “It was great that
all the teams were competing at once,
so we could see everyone’s projects.
Some projects wouldn’t have made
it out of the regionals due to time
constraints and other elements out of
their control, but still are based on a
great idea that is worth sharing.”
Many of the team members are still
stateside, enjoying New York and
socializing with the other teams now
the competition has ended.
They are also enjoying looking
around Biology labs in New York, as
apparently a whole summer working
in labs was not enough for this
hardworking team.
The results of the project will be
used in the future as a foundation for
further research, such as the genomes
the team sequenced from the bacteria
that created the cellulose.
