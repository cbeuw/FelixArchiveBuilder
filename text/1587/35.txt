‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – Shakespeare’s moral dilemma
Jingjie Cheng raves about the Globe’s new production of a classic
Despite being written almost
400 years ago in a society
vastly different from our own,
this Renaissance classic still evokes
visceral responses. There is something
deeply attractive about a story of
passionate love between brother
and sister, vengeful adulteresses and
corrupt cardinals which all end in a
bloody birthday party.
This production, in particular, was
an especially immersive experience
due to the wonderfully intimate space
of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.
Opened in January, this smaller,
indoor sister theatre of the Globe
gives the characters extraordinary
freedom to embrace the audience into
the deliciously hypocritical, bloody
and of course, incestuous world of
17th century Italy.
The candlelit setting lends itself to
the clever play of light and shadow,
while its small size allows characters
to come up close and the audience
becomes part of the set – at one point,
Anabella’s dim suitor Bergetto falls
over the railings and into an audience
member’s lap. Intimate scenes are
played with the candle lights lowered
to cast gentle shadows on faces, which
are then elevated in the more public
scenes. The lights are extinguished

one by one as Annabella’s incestuous
pregnancy is revealed and the
vengeful adulteress Hippolita’s plot
comes together with the schemes
of each suitor – culminating in the
mistaken murder of Bergetto in
complete darkness.
With three layers of performance
space, the story is presented with
exciting visual variation, where
a visitor can walk in on a heated
discussion happening on the main
stage from a lower entrance while
Annabella and her housekeeper looks
on from the balcony above; and at
the same time other characters sing
a chorus on the sides and someone
slams open the doors and walk on
stage.
In my view, this production’s
achievement was to make excellent
use of the unique space to highlight
the play’s unbridled passions.
Despite that, the play refrains from
making a judgment on the incest or
the corrupt society where it happens,
simply making it plain to the
audience and allowing us to decide for
ourselves.
There is an interesting balance
between simplicity and grandeur,
with the almost minimalist costumes
contrasted with the classical choir
interludes and live music. The
absence of ostentatious sets and
showy props brings out the fine acting
of Fiona Button as the passionate,
vivacious Annabella who simply
follows her heart, and Max Bennett as
the stubborn and arrogant Giovanni,
who insists on justifying his love with
verses from the Bible.
There are also delightful comic
interludes from James Garnon as the
“dunce” of a suitor, who transforms
into a corrupt cardinal later in the
play. Amid the materialistic, amoral
society the characters live in, the
transgressive relationship between
the siblings holds a kind of warped
innocence, only to have everything
spiral out of control as Giovanni is
gripped by obsession and vengeance.
Blood and death ends the play with
the cardinal remarking coolly that all
possessions of the dead will be taken
away by the church.
‘Tis Pity is a fascinating theatrical
journey that makes classical theatre
accessible and enjoyable for the
modern audience and is definitely
not to be missed.
‘Tis Pity is on at the Sam Wanamaker
Playhouse until 7th December
A Twentieth Century Russian Tragedy
I’ll give you my cheek you’ll want my
breast. I’ll give you my breast you’ll
want my badger. You’ll work your
way down and nothing will stop you’.
Opening on the 10th October,
director Katie Mitchell returns to
The Young Vic in a production of
Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s
final play, The Cherry Orchard. Set in
20th century Russia, the play follows
an aristocratic Russian matriarch and
her family in the midst of losing their
beloved country estate along with its
immense cherry orchard.
Initially devised as a comedy, the
play’s original director, Stanislavski,
saw it more as a tragedy and it is
this interpretation that influences
Mitchell’s current portrayal. The
set is cold and gloomy with the once
grandiose house now haggard and
poorly illuminated.
Chekhov explores many themes in
the play: nature, modernity, personal
identity and the effect of social
change.
Several works of the period
commented on the clash of old
Russia and ‘modern’ Western
values and so many deemed the
play to be Chekhov’s commentary
on a society unwilling to adapt to a
modern Russia, primarily through
his depiction of Lady Ranevskaya
and her downright refusal to save the
country estate.
The play is stolen by Gawn
Grainger in his portrayal of Firs, an
elderly and frail serf who has worked
for the family for many years. Now
barely able to walk, his years of
devotion and dedication to the family
make the final tragedy of loneliness
all the more painful.
Whilst scattered with light
comedic moments, an overwhelming
darkness predominates. Stephens has
considerably shortened the play, 2
hours in all, which serves to avoid any
moments of dullness.
The play is ideal for both Chekhov
virgins and veterans alike and the
hard-hitting conclusion is sure to
linger in your mind whatever your
experience.
The Cherry Orchard (Dir: Katie
Mitchell) is on at The Young Vic until
29th November. Monday-Saturday,
7.30pm, Matinees on Wednesday and
Saturday.
Tickets are available online, priced from
£10-35
Doing The Polka With Sigmar Polke
What is a Sigmar Polke? You
are first exposed to strange
drawings, soon giving way
to intense dotted portraits, where
eyes become mere dark recesses, their
superficial happiness running thin.
Buildings at night that are made of
melting ice cream, a supermarket
full of Supermen, an office worker
about to shoot himself in the head
with a catapult, collages of things not
disincluding porn, and a really, really
big Chairman Mao’s head. Blurred,
nearly ethereal photos of homeless
guys. You know those times when you
remember that capitalism is built on
false promises? This kind of brings
you to that point a bit quicker.
Polke as a drug. Pulverised Polke in
a glass pipe. Probably one appropriate
response to life is to take the piss.
Extension of the planet system by
a 10th planet: …Uranus, Neptune,
Pluto, Polke.” Maybe all day you
see art that’s like a bunch of dots,
or some random lines, or all white
with the top corner painted black.
Maybe a sarcastic title “Higher beings
commanded: Paint the upper right
corner black!” is an appropriate
response.
Or maybe it says something
more, like pieces without context,
or without giving your viewer
something to grab onto, without
creating some middle ground
between artist and person looking at
art, where a conversation can happen,
a bunch of dots is just a bunch of dots.
And maybe it equally says look a bit
longer, person looking at art, because
you haven’t taken any risks here –
you get to go move on and go home
at will, so shut up and look and think
a bit longer. Maybe it says neither of
these things. Maybe I just snuck up
and talked about abstract art a bit.
To visit the Tate’s Sigmar Polke
exhibition, you must wade through
all his sarcasm, wondrous depictions
of materialism, other things we’re
never going to get, the corruption
and the weird slides and the actually
a bit disturbing videos, and look
at the last four paintings, opposite
The Illusionist, which are like
nebulae, like blizzards, supernovae
and foetuses all at the same time,
presented with iridescent paint and
black backgrounds, and maybe some
uncovered sincerity.
Alibis: Sigmar Polke 1963 - 2010 is on
at the Tate Modern until 8th February.
