Arabic Night is a monthly
Middle Eastern dance
showcase in central London
and is a regular favourite of the
Imperial College Belly Dancing
Society. Last Sunday around 15 of
us headed to the fancy Moroccan
and Lebanese restaurant Maison
Touareg, located in the heart of Soho.
After getting extra cosy with the
other society members due to the
lack of appropriate seating for the
over-sold show, we tucked into
various delicious mezze dishes. Let
me tell you – there’s something
rather satisfying about gorging
yourself whilst watching professional
dancers of all sizes athletically (yet
still gracefully) twirl around an
impossibly small stage.
The dancers themselves were not
lacking in variety, with one coming
all the way from Russia, others not
so far away in Birmingham, and a
few London circuit regulars. The
acts were full of glitz, glam and
sparkles, and offered a variety of
Middle Eastern cultural references;
from traditional Baladi style to more
modern Arabic pop music, with
one dancer even pirouetting along
to a song featuring Snoop Dogg!
We were treated further with some
wonderful Indian fusion belly dance
from Monica and Heena, which was
a lovely, introspective break from
the cabaret spectacle of the previous
dancers of the night, which I feel
epitomised the sheer versatility of the
London belly dancing community.

The night also featured live tabla
drummer Sallam, who could be
seen skillfully tapping away all
evening with a cheeky smile. He
even provided the rhythm for
several entertaining improvisational
dances by Arabic Night organizer
Sarah Malik, making the best of a
potentially awkward situation when
the sound system went down.
By far the most entertaining act
of the night was Sunny the Snake
Boy, male belly dancer and compère
extraordinaire. His act involved
dancing on the tables, stealing one
belly dancing society member’s
phone and shoving it down his
skirt (yep, you read correctly!) and
twerking on various members of
the audience. He single-handedly
whipped up a raucous atmosphere in
the restaurant as he introduced each
act, and he even challenged me to a
belly-off in the interval. Belly Dance
society members will be pleased to
know that I did my best to compete!
Arabic Night is an excellent way
to get an authentic taste of Middle
Eastern dance culture, and the
atmosphere is that of a big welcoming
family. I sincerely recommend
this event for anyone looking for a
fast track induction into the world
of belly dancing. The evening was
enjoyed by new and old members, and
by men and women alike.
The next Arabic Night will be held on
the 14th December at Maison Touareg,
Soho. For more info, contact the Belly
Dancing Society at belly@imperial.ac.uk

At midday on a Monday six
Imperial College Underwater
Club members met at
Stanstead Airport. Some having
already passed through check in
the rest of us hurried to security,
which was to delay us for far longer
than anticipated, with one member
having to have their bag unpacked
and swept not once, but twice, due to
a highly suspicious item… a GoPro
handle (apparently they look like they
contain liquid on X-ray).
A long but uneventful flight
later, we arrived in Fuerteventura
to be greeted by two of the more
eccentric staff of the Deep Blue Dive
Centre, which was to be the base
of our diving. They then drove us
and our vast quantities of kit to our
accommodation, where we dropped
our stuff and went in search of food.
The next five days were spent
largely sleeping, diving, and eating,
as well as watching the world cup
semi-finals and final. Diving at a
German run dive centre, the results
were far more important than I had
anticipated when planning the trip.

Fortunately everything went the
right way and we ended up with very
happy guides.
There were a variety of dive sites
with fantastic visibility meaning that
all the sites could be seen in all their
glory. A huge amount of wildlife
was seen including many octopi,
cuttlefish, barracuda, fire worms,
shoals of sardines, and eels.
There were also several varieties
of coral; one green one looking like
an upturned Christmas tree was
particularly striking. The weather
and water temperature of a warm
21°C were a pleasant change from the
Easter trip to Cornwall.
One member also completed their
online work induction for a job
starting on the Monday after the trip.
Many thanks to the staff at the
Deep Blue Dive centre for making it a
fantastic trip!
