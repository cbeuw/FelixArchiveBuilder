Rugby player smashes coach window
with hammer during School’s Tour
Continued from the front page
The coach was originally booked
to take the team to a match in
Birmingham, but an injured player
on the Birmingham rugby team
meant Birmingham weren’t able to
play. The team were instead picked
up from Hammersmith Apollo at
around 18:00 on Wednesday evening
(29th October) and taken straight to
Bristol.
Imperial College Union found out
about the incident the following
morning around 08:00, and by
midday the whole of Imperial
Medicals were suspended and told to
return home as early as possible.
The rugby team has already paid
£5000 towards the costs of the
damages done on the coach, as a
“gesture”, although this is unlikely
to cover all of the losses made by
the company. The £5000 is thought
to have come from the pockets of
members themselves, and any further
costs will have to be covered by the
funds held by the team as a whole.
The window alone has cost £2500
to replace and the bus was rendered
unusable for a week. The company
is also keen to recover any loss of
earnings that could have been made
during this period.
After incorporating other damages
done to the coach, alongside the
loss of earnings from having to take
the vehicle off the road, the source
from the company said that the total
damages would be closer to £10,000.
The team paid £850 for the coach
hire and a further £500 to travel back
to Bristol on Thursday evening. The
coach company told Felix that the
Imperial Medicals would struggle to
book a coach in the future. “They’ve
been blacklisted with every company
in the industry.
“No-one will let them hire a vehicle,
and we will certainly be turning them
away in the future.”
The Imperial Medicals declined to
comment.
The tour, known as The School’s
Tour, takes place during October
every year. The team initially
planned to return on the 31st in
time for the Halloween Bop at the
Reynolds Bar. Tickets for the tour
were priced at £75 per person.
This follows on from the incidents
that also took place last Wednesday
with the Imperial College Rugby
team, who were seen to be stripping
on tube platforms and disrupted a
District Line train. With two of the
main rugby teams now suspended, it
has not been confirmed that Varsity
will continue as in previous years
with IC Rugby playing the Imperial
Medicals.
Imperial College Union President,
Tom Wheeler, gave Felix the
following statement on the future
of the Imperial Medicals: “I have led
an investigation into the incidents
regarding the Imperial College
Medicals Rugby Club and a decision
will be made during an emergency
meeting of the Board of Trustees
Governance Committee on Tuesday
11 November.”
Tom Wheeler also sent an email
to all Club Officers on Monday,
reminding students of the
consequences of such anti-social
behaviour.
“It gravely concerns me that these
activities are considered acceptable
and that the sanctions that I am
administering are considered
‘harsh’. I therefore feel it would be an
appropriate time to remind everyone
of the law. Drinking on public
transport is illegal. Appearing naked
in a public place is illegal. Drinking
in a minibus is illegal.
“To make it absolutely clear,
Alex, Abi and I will suspend any
Club or Team the moment that a
confirmed report is received. A
thorough investigation will then
be carried out; and this could take
weeks. Every missed fixture, booking
or activity will be forfeited, with no
compensation.
“BUCS points, money, or ‘tradition'
bear no relation to the extent of
discipline that can and will be
administered… Poor behaviour has
never been acceptable and will no
longer be tolerated.
“I am not exaggerating when I say
that if there is another event similar
to those of the previous week, the
future of student-led, independent
activity is at risk of cessation.”
