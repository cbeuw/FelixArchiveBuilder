Positive start to the season for Women’s Rugby
With the graduation of so
many of our senior girls
last year, this season was
always going to be about rebuilding
and bringing new players into
the squad. With that in mind we
thought it important to get a new
coach. We were pleased that we
hired Stewart Mcguire who, with age
grade international caps for Wales
and Ireland and currently playing
for London Scottish, has brought
enthusiasm and a lot of fun to
training.
To our delight we had a great
turnout to our taster session with
over 30 new faces giving rugby a
try. In the sunshine at Harlington
everyone seemed to be getting really
stuck in and enjoying the basis of the
game. This was followed by a BBQ
where new and old faces chatted and
got to know each other.
Our first match of the season came
along two weeks later against Royal
Veterinary College in LUSL. Being
undefeated in LUSL last year put a bit
of pressure on the new girls who were
still getting to grips with the game.
However, after some good training
under their belts, nine new players
felt confident enough to play their
first match for IC.
People were clearly nervous in the
first ten minutes or so with a few
dropped passes and minor errors.
The first try of the season went to
debutante Emily Moran playing in the
centre, who after some strong rucking
by the forwards and some quick ball
broke through the line to score. This
seemed to settle the nerves for IC
and balls started to go to hand more.
This gave our Gaelic football convert
Eimear Nolan the chance to show off
her skills scoring twice more in quick
succession. Towards the end of the
first half we were camped on their
line again but they had the put into
the scrum after a knock on. With the
scrum going well, one went against
the head which enabled our number
8, Charlie Stephens, to rumble over
from a few meters, leaving the half
time score 22-0.
The second half gave us the
opportunity to bring on even more
new girls and move people around in
their positions a bit. This provided
them with great experience and
enabled people to find out where
their best position would be. In the
first 20 minutes of the second half,
RVC upped their intensity, with
no-one gaining much superiority in
any aspect of the game. However, one
sloppy kick from their number 10
gave our full back, Sammy Ardi, the
chance to counter with a searing run
through their disorganised defence
to score under the posts and break
the second half sale mate. They hit
back and after a couple of missed
tackles from IC they too were under
the posts, leaving the final score
27-7 to us. Back of the match went to
Eimear Nolan, after her two superb
tries especially given it was her first
ever game, with forward of the match
going to Charlie Stephens.
With barely time for the bruises to
fade from our first match, we faced
UCL three days later for the start of
our BUCS campaign. Confidence was
still high after RVC, meaning even
more girls were eager to get stuck into
their first game, and we were able to
take a full squad of 22 for the first
time in years!
We started reasonably well with
Frederike Jaeger scoring the first try
of the match with us dominating
territory and possession.
Unfortunately we were struck
by injuries to key players with our
number 10, 12 and 13 all going off
within the first 25 minutes, meaning
we had to completely change our
back line, putting people out of
position and bringing new girls in
earlier than we would have expected.
We competed well upfront and won
nearly every scrum regardless of
who put the ball in, meaning we were
still on top with the territory and
possession.
Handling errors and turnovers
seemed to be our nemesis and when
they got it to their back line their
experience showed with their 13
and 14 both scoring twice, with
their 11 and 10 having a try each.
We managed to hit back, firstly

through our captain Kath Fok, who
saw they were slow to re-organise
their defensive line after a penalty.
She tapped quickly and ran half the
length of the pitch to score again for
IC.
Our final score of the match went to
Charlie who picked and went off the
back of some solid rucking, making
the final score 36-21 to UCL. Back
of the match went to Hannah Scott,
who ended up playing nearly every
position in the back line at some
point, but handled it really well,
with forward of the match going to
Charlie.
All in all, even with the
disappointment of the UCL match, it
has been a good start to the season for
women’s rugby. The defence of our
LUSL title has started well and we are
confident that, with a bit more luck
on our side, we will be able to take the
next game against UCL when we play
them in January.
Our next match sees us taking on
the unknown of St. Marys in BUCS,
where we hope to put the loss of UCL
behind us.
We always welcome new players at
any point in the term, whether you
have played before or not.
