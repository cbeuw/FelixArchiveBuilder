From the very beginning, Horns
is a film that doesn’t really
seem to know what it’s meant
to be. I’m always suspicious of a
film that describes itself with more
than two genres, but when you are a
supernatural thriller incorporating
elements of fantasy, comedy and
romance, with a bit of drama to boot,
it’s never going to go well.
The plot in itself is fairly simple.
When the long term girlfriend
(Juno Temple) of Ignatius Perrish
(Daniel Radcliffe) is murdered, Ig is
accused of her death. After drunkenly
smashing a few Virgin Mary statues,
he wakes up with horns growing on
his head, and people telling him all
their dirty little secrets. When he
realises that people will do whatever
he tells them, he decides to use this
power to try and figure out who really
killed his girlfriend.
Horns is based on the book by Joe
Hill, and unfortunately it stumbles
into all the pitfalls of a bad book
adaptation. It tries to be faithful to
the source material, but in doing
so it stuffs in so much irrelevant
detail that you question the reason
for whole scenes being in the film.
Part of the issue is the overload of
genres. It can be pretty jarring to
have a massive genre shift between
scenes, especially as this seems to
happen with every scene change.
Perhaps if it has stuck to one genre it
would have been fine. Horror would
have been a good choice, the inner
desires of people are some of the most
unpleasant things about the film,
with sex addicts, paedophiles and
the line “Stop being my son” already
being in the film. Concentrating
more on those might have helped
with the issues, rather than comedy
that mostly falls flat and a secondary
romantic subplot that I still haven’t
managed to figure out the point of.
As the film is set after the murder
of Juno Temple’s character, Merrin,
unsurprisingly there are a lot of
flashbacks. These have the dual
purpose of showing just how in
love the two of them were and
explaining exactly what happened
to Merrin. The romance is cute and
convincing. They met as children
and have been together even since.
A lot of the characters spend time
trying to convince the audience how
in love they were too. The probably
isn’t a named character who doesn’t
mention it, in a “how could you
kill her” sort of way. As the film
progresses, the flashbacks get more
messy, and it makes the film hard
to understand at times, especially as
the content of the flashbacks changes
each time Ig learns something more.
The flashbacks also attempt to reveal
most of the twists of the film, but
most are so obvious you see them
coming a mile off. Maybe two out of
“Are you feeling horny?”

Hill (novel)

Temple, Max Minghella, Joe
Anderson
many twists are genuinely surprising.
Horns marks yet another film
of Daniel Radcliffes done in an
attempt to distance himself from
the character of Harry Potter,
and he seems to finally be getting
somewhere. His acting has only
improved since Deathly Hallows, and
I was fully impressed by the range
he managed to show here. The main
issue facing both him and co-star
Juno Temple is that neither can pull
of a convincing American accent.
Juno Temple could barely keep it the
same between lines, slipping back
to her usual voice with a worrying
frequency. Daniel Radcliffe was
better, only losing it majorly a couple
of times, but still haunted by the
fact that you are only able to hear
Harry Potter when he speaks with his
British accent.
Technically the film looked lovely,
but when your characters spend
half their time in a beautiful, mossy
forest, it is pretty much impossible
for it to not look good. The opening
shot of Ig on the floor, beginning
upside down and twisting round as he
gets up, was a clever idea, but didn’t
really work in practice. The special
effects budget was obviously all spent
on the big scenes later in the film,
leaving any shots in the first half of
the film looking laughably bad.
Overall unless you are fan of the
source material, or of this sort of film
in general, or just really like forests,
you’re not going to find much you
like. You can tell that it tries hard to
make everyone happy, but in the end
that just means that no-one is going
to be satisfied.
Daniel Radcliffe tries his best to look sexy
