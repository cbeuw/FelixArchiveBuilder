Earlier this year Imperial College
London, in collaboration with
the Institute of Cancer Research
and University College London,
launched The London Movember
Centre of Excellence. The new centre
has been created to redefine and
personalise the care given to men
with prostate cancer and was funded
by the Movember Foundation and
Prostate Cancer UK.
According to Movember’s main
website, the main aim of the charity
is to raise awareness and funds in
order to change the face of men’s
health. Each year thousands of males
grow moustaches in the month of
November to spark conversation and
to generate donations towards the
Movember charity fund. Movember
and Prostate Cancer UK are investing
a total of £10 million over five years
in the London centre.
One of the main aims of the charity
is to raise awareness of Prostate
Movember Centre of
Excellence opens in London
cancer, which is the most common
cancer in men. The centre will bring
scientists together to help improve
the lives of men with prostate cancer.
The researchers will look for genetic
and cellular signals that can help
identity high risk patients as well as
those that can help in the selection
process of therapies used in the later
stage of the disease.
Alongside this, the centre will focus
on training those who will become the
future leaders and the drive behind
prostate cancer research. They hope
to start testing new therapies and
diagnostic tools within five years.
Professor Charlotte Bevan, from
theDepartment of Surgery and
Cancer at Imperial, said: “The Centre
will enable scientists and clinicians
from each of the three partner
institutes to work together to really
make an impact.
It is a great vision that Movember
and Prostate Cancer UK have, to
bring together complementary
expertise to expedite results and
change for patients and we are excited
about being part of it.”

College to build advanced drone lab
Philippa Skett welcomes our new lying robotic overlords
Imperial is spending £1.25m to
build the most advanced drone
lab in the UK. The testing lab is
to be built on the South Kensington
campus, as an investment into next
generation robotics, and construction
of the lab will begin in 2016.
The Brahmal Vasudevan Aerial
Robotics Lab will be a two-story
structure that will feature workshops
and a working laboratory. The lab
will be installed on the roof of the
City and Guilds building, and will
have also teaching facilities for
Undergraduates and Postgraduates.
It will house a workshop for
manufacturing aerial robots, and will
feature an arena to put the new flying
robots to the test. There will also be
facilities to test the robots in water
too, which will aid the development
of robots for search and rescue
missions.
The aerial arena will have sixteen
high speed 3D aerial tracking
cameras, whilst the water tank will
feature a further eight to track
to robots as they swim and dive
throughout the water.
The lab was funded by Dr Brahmal
Vasudevan, an alumnus of Imperial
College London, who donated the
£1.25m costs in full. Dr Vasudevan
studied Aeronautical Engineering at
Imperial before completing an MBA
from the Harvard Business School,
and is now the Founder and Chief
Executive officer of Creador, a private
equity firm based in Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore and India.
Professor Jeff Magee, Dean of the
Faculty of Engineering, said: “The
Brahmal Vasudevan Aerial Robotics
Lab will be a focal point for our aerial
robotics research and education
activities.
We also want this facility to a
place for prospective students and
school children to visit, inspiring
them to become future aeronautical
engineers.”
Professor Alice Gast, President
of Imperial College London, said:
“Aerial robotics has a tremendous
range of applications, and Imperial is
well-equipped to play a pivotal role in
this nascent industry.
Brahmal Vasudevan’s generosity
and vision will allow our students,
academics and industrial partners
to rapidly advance research and
innovation in this exciting field.” Could we be seeing flying drones like this all over campus? Photo: patdollard.com
RAG tells Rugby: ‘We don’t want your junk’

In light of recent events
surrounding Imperial College
Rugby Club, the RAG committee
chose to remove the team from their
naked calendar for 2015.
RAG Chair Ben Fernando said:
“Following conversations with the
Union, we made the decision to
pull the photo from the calendar.”
Fernando said that he held
discussions with Chris Kaye, Deputy
President (Welfare), and Alex Savell,
Deputy President (Finance and
Services), over the issue.
However when asked for a
comment, Chris Kaye vehemently
denied ever suggesting removing the
picture to RAG.
The picture was taken last Thursday
evening, with the decision to pull
the picture taken later in the night.
Fernando said that whilst it may have
resulted in bad publicity, but it was a
strong response from the Union.
It has since transpired that a
member of the committee released
the photo to the team, allegedly
without the permission of Ben
Fernando.
It was subsequently posted on
Facebook, and has now gained more
than 200 ‘likes’.
Fernando concluded by saying: “We
thank all the other sports teams for
offering to participate and we look to
finalise these as soon as possible. We
now have a month available if anyone
else is interested.”
It was undecided which month
Rugby would have taken in the
calendar.
