Royally entertaining…”,
“stimulating comedy”, “a
victoriously vulgar piece of
light entertainment.” Not so fast!
That’s what the popular, royalist
press of this country has been saying
about this year’s must-see show, King
Charles III at the Wyndham Theatre.
Of course, for a huge proportion
of the British population, the Royal
Family are, quite literally, the
crown jewels of this great country.
Unfortunately, I’m not one of those
people, and so it shouldn’t surprise
you that I was not quite as “royally
entertained” as some other parts of
the admittedly jovial audience. A
great play maybe, but a shocking case
of trivialising a scarily dark issue.
I may not have found King Charles
III particularly funny but I cannot
deny that Mike Bartlett’s new play is
an exceptional work.
Usually performed by Tim Pigott-
Smith, Charles’ understudy Miles
Richardson stepped up to replace him
with an exemplary performance (even
if he does look a good twenty years
too young), supported by a superb cast
(less one or two theatrical dunces).
Directed by Rupert Goold, the play
centres around Charles’ role as king
after his mother Elizabeth II dies

Two Girls Embracing (Friends) 1915. Egon Schiele
(sometime around 2022 apparently).
A little too enthusiastic about his
newfound “ceremonial” powers, and
all too eager to leave his mark as
Britain’s greatest ever monarch, the
country is left in turmoil following
Charles’ refusal to sign a new bill.
Although the likelihood of such
an event taking place nowadays
is (hopefully) extremely remote,
the play does raise serious and
uncomfortable questions about the
role of the British monarchy
Bartlett’s play unravels like a
Shakespearean epic and touches on all
the facets of these alarming questions
as part of a stunning new play.
If Bartlett’s script had been left like
this, maybe it’d be the best new work
of the year. But like all the great royal
stories, Harry’s so-called girlfriend is
portrayed as a ditsy, pretty, not very
opinionated slut (not my ideal choice
of words but it’s how it comes across),
and for some reason Diana’s ghost
decides to glide across the stage every
now and then, in a ridiculous, panto
style joke.
It wasn’t a huge issue, and it
certainly didn’t spoil the show, but
it is a real shame that whenever the
royals are spoken about, what would
otherwise be considered a real, serious
King Charles III – Princely Propaganda or Royalist Treat?
Max Falkenberg asks if this play glosses over an important issue
problem is simply trivialised with
some stupid joke about Camilla’s
horse-face.
The performances of those
characters playing serious roles in
the show were exceptional, with
Lydia Wilson as Princess Kate
being a particular stand out. But
again, poor casting and unfriendly
writing meant that regardless of
performance quality, several of the
casts smaller roles felt stunted and
were unfortunately performed with
little conviction.
I must admire Mike Bartlett’s
attempt in writing a play about such a
touchy issue, but I can’t help but feel
he lost his way somewhere.
Yes, the show is gripping
throughout. Yes, the cast is great.
Yes, the pretty red steps on the blank
stage provide a perfect framing for
such a show. But the next time I go
see a show about real people and real
issues, don’t get a clown to prance all
over the stage and make the whole
idea look ridiculous.
That’s not to say it wasn’t a great
show, but you better be a royalist for
it not to annoy you.
King Charles III is on at Wynham’s
Theatre, until 31st January.
"A real,

Amention of sex in any context,
really, is usually enough to get
people excited (pun intended).
After all, to quote Oscar Wilde:
“Everything in the world is about sex,
except sex. Sex is about power”.
It is clear to spectators of The
Radical Nude – the first solo exhibit
of Egon Schiele’s nudes in the UK –
that in all of the paintings, whether
dark tones or vivid bright colors,
there is an unexpected sense of the
power of the imperfect naked human
form. And so, in that sense, Schiele
revolutionized the traditionally
fragile and limp take on the nude.
With his “radical nudes”, Schiele
is equally successful and scandalous
in breaking both the artistic
conventions and social taboos of his
time. Paradoxically, there is a kind
of unnaturally natural and softly
aesthetic beauty in the way the sharp
angles, inorganic colors, and awkward
poses complement each other and
form the total work of art.
While Schiele employs
unconventionally bold colors to
animate and charge some of his
nudes with sexual energy, he uses
solely dark, deathly tones in others.
These nudes are even further from
traditional, conveying not only a far
from idealised image of the human
form, but one moreover dark and
diseased. Schiele’s friends called this
style “the death beneath the skin”,
and it is one the artist used often to
further complicate the eroticism of
the nude with a Freudian conflict of
desire and death.
These nudes are clearly alive, but
at the same time are also dying. This
dichotomy, which runs through all
of Schiele’s work, is what gives it
its wonderful, heady tension, and
syphilitic energy.
Though bordering on pornography
and enough to certainly raise a few
early 20th century brows, Schiele’s
nudes are never mindlessly erotic,
but rather sophisticatedly sexy.
The works at The Radical Nude are
often psychologically symbolic and
philosophically suggestive.
For example, in Two Girls Embracing
(1915), Schiele paints one woman
conventionally while the other
appears more as a doll with dull point
eyes. This detail gives the painting a
further symbolically dynamic depth
beyond the - at that time scandalous –
lesbian implications.
Moreover, in many of the exhibited
paintings, the figures demonstrate
Schiele’s characteristically alien and
unnatural gestures, which despite
being expressive, seem to hold some
mysterious coded meaning.
This analysis could be applied to all
of Schiele’s work, which is perhaps
why their legacy has lasted for nearly
a century. In the history of the nude
– an artistic canon that stretches
from the Venus of Willindorf,
through Da Vinci, and all the way to
contemporary artists like Tracy Emin
– Schiele’s work stands out as bold,
unique, and visceral.
It is perhaps the elusive nature of
Schiele’s nudes more so than their
sexual subject that captivates the
audience. For a moment one manages
to grasp the intention behind the pose
and colors and lines but the moment
passes, and the meaning evades
the observer. The nudes cannot be
fully understood (much like Schiele
himself) and that is perhaps why they
continue to fascinate generation after
generation.
Egon Schiele: The Radical Nude, is
on at The Courtald Gallery, located
in Somerset House. It runs from 23rd
October until 18th January.
Tickets are £8.50 for adults, £7.50 for
students. Free for members.
