things still leave me feeling angry.
It’s a gut reaction, something that
happens when I see such blatant
cheapening of what I love.
I feel like everyone should be
able to have access to art, but not
through a beer bottle. It is especially
jarring when such schemes do little
to help anyone bar the artist and the
industry. I’m not suggesting that
Emin gives up her entire income;
after all, her dedication to the cult of
mammon is well documented: as well
as very public declarations in favour
of the Conservatives and against high
tax rates, Emin owns properties in
London, St Tropez, Miami, and NYC.
Such behaviour should therefore not
be surprising.
Not all collaborations are bad.
Some, though far from all, help
to raise money for philanthropic
causes. An example would be the
relationship between the Keith
Haring Foundation and Tommy
Hilfiger, who in 2010 designed a
series of trainers featuring prints
by the late American artist. The
proceeds went to the Foundation,
which provides grants for children
in need and those affected by HIV/
AIDS, the disease that eventually
went on to kill Haring in 1990. In
essence, such projects are no different
to those in other disciplines, such
as the Red Hot CDs, which also raise
money for HIV/AIDS, and whose
latest release draws on the work of
American musician Arthur Russell.
Both help to promote charity, and
perhaps expose more people to works
of art they would otherwise never see.
However, one of the main problems
that I have with the issue is the way it
contributes to the commercification
of fine art. Walter Benjamin, writing
in A Small History of Photography,
talks about the ‘aura’ of art, a term
that refers to its fetishization within
culture. A work of art exists only
in one place, and can only be seen
in that place at any one time –
this uniqueness within space and
time means that the work of art is
not accessible to the masses, and
therefore becomes desirable.
You may argue that the relationship
between art and industry helps
break down this aura. After all,
by releasing a range of designer
handbags, Kusama ensures that her
work is not only present in galleries,
but also out on the streets! This view,
although optimistic, is also naive,
ignoring the economic aspect of such
collaborations. The vast majority of
works produced in these processes are
extortionately expensive, following
the idea of ‘purchase equals pleasure’
fundamental to a capitalist economy.
Rather than a democratisation of art,
instead what happens is culture, by
and large, remains accessible only to
a select few, a plutocracy, operating in
the upper echelons of commerce.
So why do I feel this way about
artists, and not other disciplines?
Why is it that the idea of Jeremy
Deller, last year chosen to represent
the UK at the Venice Biennale,
designing the interior of a Louis
Vuitton store in 2009 makes me roll
my eyes, but architects get a free pass
designing the exterior? Perhaps it is
because such a relationship seems
inevitable. Fashion houses have
always needed stores; physical spaces
in which, if their goods are not sold,
they can at least be admired by those
who can’t afford them (think of the
sheer amount of glass plating used by
the fashion industry).
If someone has to design these
buildings, it might as well be a good
architect. Zaha Hadid’s Chanel
Pavillion, designed in 2008 and
resembling a low flying cloud, is just
as beautiful as her other buildings;
Herzog and de Meuron's 2003
Prada store in Tokyo is undeniably
a beautiful building, with its criss
cross patterning and bulging glass
facade. The building as a structure can
be honest, even if what is contained
inside is not.
Similarly, photographers seem to
pose less of a problem for me. When
Cindy Sherman collaborated with
Comme des Garcons in 1995 it didn’t
seem like a big transgression, but
rather a natural extension of her
work. Similarly, Juergen Teller’s 16
year collaboration with Marc Jacobs
can be seen as a source of art, even if
his bright, high-flash style has since
been tainted by Terry Richardson,
the high priest of sleaze.
The crux of the issue for me
comes down to inevitability: the
relationship between architects or
photographers and fashion houses
seems like a direct consequence of
their structure. The house creates
garments, images of which need to be
circulated around society, whether
that is through print or digital
media; similarly, a space is needed
in which to present the objects,
and the building itself is a neutral
construction. But there’s no necessity
for artists to do this. The artists who
do so would still be able to pay the
bills if they refused – it is not a case
of do or die. Through expanding
their bank balance they destroy the
beauty and importance of art; a Yayoi
Kusama print becomes something to
stitch into clothes; a George Condo
canvas mutates from a terrifying,
neo-surrealist nightmare into decor
for a Birkin bag. Art becomes just
another commodity, to be consumed,
digested, and ultimately thrown
away.
