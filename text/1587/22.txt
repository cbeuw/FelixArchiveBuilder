Chanon Wongs atayanont discusses the effects of depression
"What
makes
low mood
different
from
depression
is its
duration,
intensity
and
persistence."
"It's like
you've
taken a
step back
from
life and
become a
spectator."
This week, let’s move on from
anxiety to the more cheerful
topic of depression. To the
sufferers, it is the worst feeling in
the world. But for those who have
never experienced it, it is hard to
truly understand how unpleasant or
disruptive it is, so this article will try
to explain how it feels.
First things first, I have to clarify
that being depressed is not just being
sad.
We use the phrase “I feel depressed”
whenever we feel that things aren’t
going our way but that is not
depression, clinically so. Ask your
medic friends who’s done a psych
module and they’ll tell you that
depression is a mood disorder that
disrupts one’s daily life and can be
potentially life-threatening.
However, because being sad is
similar to being depressed, there’s
a lot of misunderstanding that
downplays the struggle faced
by people with depression. This
sentiment can be summed up with
the statement: “I’ve felt down before
but I can snap out of it, so why can’t
they just toughen up?”
What makes low mood different
from depression is its duration,
intensity and persistence.
Being depressed isn’t just feeling
sad or experiencing low self-esteem;
it is often accompanied by a sense
of hopelessness and the lack of
motivation to do anything, even
getting out of bed. You can probably
see how that can interfere with daily
life.
This sense of despair deserves
a special mention since it can be
difficult to fully grasp. This can
range from losing interest and
pleasure in what you used to enjoy,
to an intensely blank state where
everything in the world can be
summed up by the phrase, ‘Why do
I even bother?’ It’s like you’ve taken
a step back from life and become a
spectator, watching everything going
on but feeling absolutely empty.
Worse, rather than a spectator, you
can also become your own malicious
critic, sneering at and condescending
to everything you do. This is when
self-blame and self-hate comes in,
which can plunge you even deeper
into depression and potentially put
you in danger. I’ll elaborate more on
this later.
As for duration, depression is
chronic. Sufferers can be stuck in that
mood for a few weeks or months. Or
alternatively, it can last for a few days
at a time, but will come back time
and time again until you can almost
predict when your next episode is
going to be.
Depression is also irrational, even
if what they’re depressed about
can seem perfectly rational to the
sufferer. In other words, a phase
might come out of nowhere, not
always in response to a specific
problem. This is what makes it so
hard for others to understand why
depressed people can’t just “pull
themselves together”.
When you’re suffering from a low
mood, you tend to feel better by
making changes to your life, such
as resolving a difficult situation
or getting more sleep. It’s not that
simple for depressed people because
the sufferer often doesn’t feel any
better no matter what they do, or they
might not even find the motivation
to do anything. Most of the time, it
simply takes time and support for the
sufferer to feel better.
This is why the sufferer often feels
helpless and isolated since there is
nothing they can do to change how
they feel even if they’re desperately
trying to ‘get better’.
I’ve once heard this description
from a sufferer. He said that it’s
like he is drowning in a stormy sea.
He tries to swim to the surface and
become happy again, but the waves
always wash over his head, pushing
him back down into dark waters.
Eventually, he just gives in and waits
for the sea to calm.
I touched earlier on self-blame,
and this is where it comes in. Since
the sufferer is helpless to make
themselves feel better, they often
turn to themselves and say “Why
aren’t you living your life like
everybody else? You don’t even have
a reason to be sad!” Sometimes, they
are aware that they’re suffering an
episode but there’s nothing they can
do.
Self-blame can turn into self-
hate which can spiral down a dark
road very quickly, especially in
more severe cases of depression.
Fortunately, self-harm and suicidal
thoughts are not common with
depression, and those are the
moments professional help may be
needed.
But like most illnesses, recovery
is always possible with the right
treatment and support. Patient,
understanding friends who are
willing to bear with the sufferer
through the episodes is as helpful as
any professional help.
Depressed people tend to avoid
friends and relatives. Even when
approached, they can be irritable,
gloomy and difficult. But you can
show that you care by listening,
appreciating them or just spending
time with them. By doing so, even
though they don’t show it at the time,
you are already helping immensely
and they would say so once the
episode is over.
As for actively helping them, you
must be prepared to accept that
sometimes, you can’t in the same way
you’d approach your own problems.
Instead, it might be best to encourage
them to talk about their feelings
and get them to work out what they
think is most likely to make them
feel better.
If, though, you feel that you are
at a loss of what to do or you feel
that your friend is at risk of hurt
themselves, the numbers provided
in the column beside are there to
help you as well as the sufferers.
And I hope this article helps you
understand this crippling disorder a
bit better.
If you are concerned
about your own
mental health,or that
of a loved one,there
are people out there
you can talk to who
can give you advice,or
will be there to listen.
