The highlights of Berlin
Yung Nam Cheah shares her favourite spots in the German capital
It has been almost thirty years
since the fall of the Berlin Wall
when the capital of Germany
finally became whole again. Left with
gaping wounds on their landscape,
the city has been reborn in an
extraordinary way in the last three
decades whilst embracing its cultural
heritage.
On one hand you have the
centuries old Berliner Dom built in
Renaissance style next to the river
Spree, then there is the sprawling
Memorial to the Murdered Jews, a
tribute of over 19,000m3
of concrete
blocks commemorating the tragedy
of WWII.
Having spent a month in Berlin, I
couldn’t help but fall in love with this
metropolis complete with its multi-
national inhabitants. Despite my best
efforts, I couldn’t visit everything I
wanted to, but here are some of my
top five most frequented hangouts:
Tempolhofer Park
A former airfield that was still in
use until 2008, this endless stretch of
criss-crossing tarmac paths is now an
unofficial park beloved by Berliners.
With over 300 hectares of ground,
it is pretty safe to say that you won’t
have to worry about not finding a free
spot. With the fenced off terminal at
the side and numerous abandoned
planes scattered around, there’s
plenty for you to explore.
The best way to do so is to
rollerblade or cycle; it’s not every
day you get to whiz down an airport
runway, or have a barbeque while you
watch people paraglide.
The park also hosts various pop-up
events; during my visit there was a
modern art mini golf installation,
right next to a horticulture corner
run by a local University. High
profile events such as the Berlin
Marathon and the Popkomm (during
Berlin Music Week) were also held
there.
The only downside of this park is
that it’s not easy to reach from; you
have to walk quite a distance with
no signs to direct you. Therefore
it’s recommended that you studied
your route or print out a map in
preparation for your visit.

Biergartens and Beach Bars
It would be a shame for you to visit
Berlin and not indulge yourself in the
favourite drink of the nation.
Whilst unfortunately biergarten
is not a place where beers grow out
of the ground and nor are beach bars
actually next to the beach, they are
favourite hangout spots for locals
who flock there on sunny afternoons
to chat and gulp down a few pints.
I had accidently stumbled into a
biergarten on my first day in Berlin –
the relaxing, friendly vibe had drawn
me in like a moth to flame. Equipped
with an expanse of chairs scattered
across a courtyard, there will be a bar
serving all kind of beers imaginable,
from the local Berliner to a refreshing
lemon beers .
There is usually a snack stand too,
selling wrusts (German sausages) and
chips. There is an endless parade of
biergartens throughout Berlin and
some even have their own brew for
the beer fanatic in you to try.
Despite my inability to figure out
why Berliners are so obsessed with
sand, beach bars are admittedly a
marvellous idea.
Often situated next to the river,
or in some cases on a rooftop, you
will find rustic wooden benches and
deckchairs scattered across sandpits
and raised platforms, not unlike
those you find in popular seaside
destinations. Some of the more
dedicated bars even have a hot tub for
its guests and in those next to a river
or a lake many of the punters would
venture in for a swim in the summer
months.

Mauerpark Fleamarket
One of the largest scale flea markets
that I have ever seen in my life, there
is no doubt that this is my favourite
place on Earth, hands down.
Open every Sunday, this place is
completely swamped with tourists
and local alike, as well as a plethora of
street artists performing next to the
market.
The eastern entrance leads you
straight into the busiest, more
professional part of the market selling
handmade jewellery, homemade
honey in variety of flavours, printed
shirts and drawstring bags.
The best parts of the flea market
are the ever changing second hand
stores further in. It is a true treasure
hunt as you browse from stall to stall,
haggling with stall owners for that
gorgeous vintage skirt or stumbling
upon a pair of retro roller skates that
is just your size.
Further on are rows after rows of
antique wares lined under tents, and
stalls selling sunglasses or fridge
magnets with quirky quotes. Unless
you go into the market with nothing
on you, it is a true feat to emerge
without spending any dosh in this
place.
It is very easy to feel claustrophobic
and if you need to refuel or
escape, there’s plenty of food store
around selling Nutella crepes and
Currywrusts and you head over to the
empty green space next to the market
to enjoy the music from Maurerpark
bearpit karaoke, or up the hill to enjoy
the graffiti and swings.

MarkhalleNeue Street Food
Thursday
Located in the hip district of
Kreuzberg, this hall transforms into
Tempolhofer Park on a sunny afternoon. Photo: Yung Nam Cheah
a indoor market that is a true foodie’s
heaven every Thursday evening when
an international throng of street food
stalls congregate to sell their mouth-
watering goods to eager diners.
As you meander through the gaggle
of people browsing the variety of food
on offer, you will be wishing you can
grow a second stomach so you can
savour all the deliciousness on offer.
Be it Chinese hand pulled noodle,
Korean Kimchi burgers, Taiwanese
pulled pork bao or a New York
Pastrami burger, you will inevitably
buy more than you have money for
and ended up stuffed beyond belief.
Yet you won’t regret it for the
world and will vow to yourself you
will return next week, and again, and
again.
Except you can’t, so you can only
settle for buying a cup of fresh mint
fruit tea to pacify yourself.

Humanas at Frankfuter Tor
Technically speaking this isn’t an
attraction at all, but part of a second
hand chain store. Why is it on my
list then, you might ask. Well the
answer is that I have been to this shop
three times, and every time I ended
up spending hours in there scouring
through the racks and scouring a
good buy.
If your not adverse to the idea of
second hand clothing and harbour an
inner hipster shopaholic inside you,
then this could be your salvation or
your downfall, depending on how you
look at it.
