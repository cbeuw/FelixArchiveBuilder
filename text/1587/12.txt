The Comic Convention you’d be craz
Why would someone with
no knowledge of any
anime, comic books, and
video games attend an event aimed
at bringing these people together?
Curiosity, that’s why.
The MCM London Comic
Convention starts much earlier than I
anticipated; costumed attendees with
bright hair and elaborate costumes
board the Jubilee line at Westminster
on their way to the ExCeL centre
where the event is being held. The
excited chatter describes their
speculations on what they’ll see today
and whilst the startling juxtaposition
of businesspeople commuting to
work and young adults dressed in
tinfoil armour momentarily takes me
aback, the cosplayers are oblivious to
the judgement of the general public;
this is their weekend and they arrive
in blazing confidence, flooding
into the DLR on the last leg of their
incoming journey.
I strike up a conversation with a
young, glamorous singer with deep
blue hair on the train. Sagey, 21, a
London-based make-up artist, talks to
me about why people enjoy dressing
up as their favourite characters so
much.
“It’s a chance to become, if only just
for a weekend, someone you really
admire.” It doesn’t matter that the
character is fictional; good fiction
is always believable and is expertly
crafted to arguably teach us so much
more succinctly than real life role
models.
In fact, having a role model in
the first place is a sign of humility
and self-acceptance that there is
something or some goal you aspire to
be that you haven’t achieved yet.
Sagey is dressed as a male singer
from a long-named anime that I
forget almost instantaneously. Her
long white jacket is elegantly adorned
with golden tassels and yellow rope,
and the gold-and-black gloves and
collar complement the purple-blue
hair in giving off a regal aura.
I ask her what part of her costume
took him longest to prepare, and she
replies, “The costume was actually
made by a family friend – the make-
up takes a while though; it takes
maybe three hours to get ready, and I
usually come as a different character
every day.” As well as layers of
foundation to change the colour of
the skin tone, the eyebrows are also
purple and heavy eye shadow brings
out Sagey’s large, dark blue eyes
peering out innocently underneath
special contact lenses.
The feeling I got as I entered the
main hall of the ComicCon venue is
best described as one which would
give any conformist a heart attack.
I was afraid that knowing nothing
about the convention would mean
getting physically and mentally lost,
but instead I was instantly trying to
suppress laughter at the incredible
incredulity of it all.
Elsa from Disney’s Frozen walks
past me without a second glance with
a Batman and several Stormtroopers
following her. A female Loki and a
male pixie stop and have a chat with
Katniss Everdeen in the magnificent
white winged dress from Catching
Fire. A white knight with a staring
sun emblazoned on his chest looks
inquisitively at a black one with a
boar sigil and one arm as he walks by.
This is, beyond a doubt, one of the
most amazing places I’ve ever set foot
in. I simply stand there and try and
take in the extraordinary atmosphere
a little more.
After composing myself, I enter the
nearest hall and find myself facing an
uncountable number of busy stalls, all
advertising colourful merchandise.
Food stalls sat in the corner selling
Western and Japanese style foods
and other innovative treats, such as
flavoured ice with fruit. There are
big trademarks and vaguely familiar
internet brands that draw the eye,
such as a giant inflated Pikachu
hanging off the ceiling, clearly above
the Pokémon stall.
Video game brands such as Square
Enix and Harvest Moon hang their
recognisable banners from the
ceiling, and I notice some stalls
belonging to apparent YouTube stars
and other internet phenomena such
as Cyanide & Happiness and Weebl’s
Stuff. Famous hardware brands such
as Nvidia and Samsung appear too, to
demonstrate their latest technology. I
take a peek into a theatre and there’s
an ongoing panel from RoosterTeeth
who have also gained online fame
"It's a
chance to
become,
if only
just for a
weekend,
someone
you really
admire."
I was
instantly
trying to
suppress
laughter
at the
incredible
incredulity
of it all.
