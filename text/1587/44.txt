Many people in our world
face severe challenges just
to live and get by each
day, though we may not see them
around in our privileged lives as
students at university. Engineers
Without Borders UK is a charitable
organisation that believes access to
engineering and technical know-how
can help overcome many of these
challenges.
Our work aims to demonstrate
the link between engineering and
humanity, a connection that is often
neglected in our education and in
practice.
EWB Imperial, a branch of EWB
UK, is a well-established society
providing opportunities for Imperial
students, local school children and
our international partners. We are
a gathering of environmentally and
socially conscious engineers and non-
engineers, engaging in meaningful
projects which create Massive Small
Change both locally and abroad.
Now at Imperial, there are a
plethora of different ways to
get involved with International
Development (ID), with groups
focussing on fundraising and
awareness such as UNICEF-Imperial
and Imperial Hub, as well as others
preparing and organising teams of
volunteers to go around the world to
help out first-hand in critical areas,
such as EWB-Imperial, Raincatcher,
Kenyan Orphan Project, e.quinox,
and Water Brigades.
The challenges faced during ID
projects are quite different from any
you might experience on your course.
One must observe, interact and
consult with all the local stakeholders
to gain a complete understanding of
the barriers to development.
Many engineers are able to work
through the technical aspects of
a project, however only a handful
have the range of skills necessary to
overcome linguistic, political and
practical obstacles and create positive
change.
These skills are highly transferrable
to a working environment, and have
enabled previous EWB members as
well as those from other ID societies
to make a bright start to their chosen
careers. Many employers hold
application processes which look for
people who will be responsible and
have indicated their commitment
beyond involvement in technical
projects.
To this end, EWB Imperial is
running a programme of scenario-
based workshops called “Leadership
for Development” (LfD) in
partnership with Imperial Hub.
Running for the 3rd
consecutive year
since their inception, these sessions
are given by experienced researchers
and professional engineers, to help
you acquire the tools to finance, plan
and deliver a successful overseas
project. Imperial Horizons also run
the EWB Challenge for 2nd
years,
covering similar themes to LfD, and
culminating in a design submission to
the National competition.
The 3rd
LfD talk of the season has
now taken place – “Cross-Cultural
Communication” with Ruth Fuller, a
volunteer with EWB-UK. In previous
weeks, students across the College
have attended our introductory
session-come-mingle “What is
International Development?” with
Louise Bloom from the Refugee
Studies Centre at Oxford University,
and our next talk, which was matter-
of-factly titled “Fundraising” with
Abi Taylor from Student Hubs.
There are still seven more LfD
talks lined up for this academic
year. Next week on 13th
November,
we are welcoming Doug Harper,
the CEO of EWB-UK no less, to
host a debate on what Effective
Aid really is (for example: does
sending your old shoes or clothes to
Massive, Small Change
Shiladitya Ghosh & Marcus Bishop on opportunities with EWB
"We...
create
Massive
Small
Change
both
locally
and
abroad."
This tip is also useful in life. Photo: Engineers Without Borders

developing countries actually help
address the problems they face?)
Following this, on 27th
November we
have representatives from Black &
Veatch, a global infrastructure and
engineering company, visiting us to
speak about “Project Management &
Sustainability” in an ID context.
You shouldn’t fear having missed
out on these past sessions (and
past years’). Every talk has been
documented on our dedicated
blog including pictures and full
presentation slides.
The next talk starts at 6pm in ACEX
"... there
are a
plethora
of ways
to get
involved"
Wilkommen, Bienvenue...

We also have the second article this year from
Engineers Without Borders,and a teutonic tour
report from Underwater.Finally,to launch the Union’s
International Imperial week,starting next Monday,
we have Katherine Chio’s London:ASurvivalGuidefor
InternationalStudents.
Exciting things happening over the next week

Societies,the irst Cosmopolitan Café,and
Raincatcher Imperial’sWaterRace2014,a team
treasure hunt across London carrying 20L of water.
This is running tomorrow (Saturday 8th

be highly entertaining at the very least (it’s also for
charity).
More on this in the next issue,as well as the inal
results from RAG’s Jailbreak.
As ever,we are on the hunt for articles! If your club
