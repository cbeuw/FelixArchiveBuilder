Iconic. It’s a word that’s thrown
around a lot these days. Defined
as ‘a person or thing regarded as a
representative symbol, or as worthy
of veneration’, it has today come to
be used as a catch-all term for anyone
who is elevated even slightly above
the general public. If there’s one
person who truly deserves the title
icon in this world, it’s got to be Debbie
Harry, the brilliant, bold, beautiful
front woman of new wave/punk band
Blondie, who form the central subject
of Somerset House’s new exhibition:
Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and
The Advent of Punk, a selection of
photos by Blondie’s guitarist Chris
Stein which, although small, has a
lasting and powerful effect.
Taking the photos as mere objects,
the skill of Stein is immediately
apparent; having trained at the
School of Visual Arts in the mid-60s,
he did have some formal education
in the discipline. However, Stein
approaches photography in much the
same way he addresses his music: with
a punk, DIY attitude. ‘Photography
was distant and mysterious’, says
Stein, ‘[it] was simply “there”,
but undefined’. Within the
composition of the photos, his
unique photographic eye is evident;
Debbie Harry herself said that ‘the
singularity of Chris’ eye view of the
world comes through in every shot’.
As the subject of many of the
photos present, Debbie Harry shines;
not satisfied with one public persona,
Harry shape-shifts throughout the
exhibition, her cut glass cheekbones
the only thing remaining constant.
In one delightful photo from 1976
she is walking down 14th Street, in
NYC’s East Village; clad in head to toe
black, with her platinum hair shining
like a halo around her head, she cuts
a striking figure, and everyone in
the photo turns to look as she walks
past. In another, taken in 1978 while
at the video shoot for ‘Picture This’,
she is illuminated from behind by a
starburst of studio lighting. Clutching
a microphone in her hand, she stands
on a neon walkway, looking like an
alien beamed down from another
world, here to save us from the
horrors of mediocrity.
Debbie Harry’s subversive nature
is also apparent, honed through
years of making music in a heavily
male-dominated environment. In one
amazing shot, Harry is reclining in
the plush black leather seat of a train,
clutching a copy of The Sun, whose
headline, commenting on the social
situation in Iran, screams ‘WOMEN
ARE JUST SLAVES’. Above the edge
of the paper, Harry stares directly
into the camera, a slight smile
playing around her eyes, as if she is
aware of the gross hypocrisy of the
mainstream media.
These photos not only show the
versatility of Harry’s public image,
but serve as a history lesson of the
1970s punk-rock scene, at that time
centred around down-and-dirty NYC:
here she is grinning with a dapper,
bequiffed Bowie; here’s Andy Warhol
adjusting her hair before a photo
shoot; here’s Jean-Michel Basquiat
serving as an extra for Blondie’s
‘Rapture’ video, spinning records
on a set of decks. From Joan Jett to
David Byrne, Iggy Pop to William
S. Burroughs, it seems Blondie
deliberately sought out the company
of fellow icons.
Ultimately, this exhibition –
although slight – is well worth
visiting, especially for anyone with
an interest in the music scene of
1970’s New York, which the photos
help consolidate into a near-tangible
presence. As Stein himself says:
‘they ground the moment in some
semblance of solidity’; they bring the
atmosphere of the era into the room,
and beam Debbie Harry directly into
today’s world. A bit more present, but
every bit as iconic.
Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie,
and The Advent of Punk runs until 25th
January, 10:00-18:00. Free Admission
Skate at Somerset House, the ice-rink,
will run from 11th
November until 11th
January. Tickets are available online.

Too Many Firsts by Riyadh Rateme
Style.It’s different to fashion.
Fashion suggests something
fleeting,with trends that slip by
like wind.Style,in contrast,is much
more constant.It evokes a timeless
ideal of chic-ness,a trend that will
never go out of style; in other words,
a classic.
This week’s issue is devoted to Style,
and is the irst of our‘Themed Issues’
which will be running throughout
this term.We start off with a look
at Debbie Harry,who epitomises
style in a new exhibition of photos
at Somerset House.We then move
swiftly on to The Photographer’s
Gallery,whose hallowed halls play
host to two fashion photographers
from opposing ends of the century:
Edward Steichen,the high priest
of modernist fashion,and Viviene
Sassen,whose confrontational
photos challenge traditional ideas of
photography.
Fashion is the next target in our
sights,as we explore the links
between clothing and power at
the Design Museum’s latest show,
and analyse the long-standing
relationship between art and
fashion.
Of course,the theme is not the be all
and end all.We also have a number
of other reviews of what is going on
in London.If you’re into art,check
out Kieran’s review of the Sigmar
Polke,or Elizaveta’s analysis of Egon
Schiele’s nudes.If theatre is more
your thing,then you can choose
from Max’s royal review of Charles
III,Jingjie’s take on‘Tis Pity She’s A
Whore,or or Mario’s short and sweet
piece on The Cherry Orchard.
Here’s to a stylish week...
