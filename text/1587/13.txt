y to miss but even crazier to attend
through popular humour.
But the heart of all the
commercialisation is raised
high upon the shoulders of the
independent creative artists and
businesses who humbly come
to events like these to sell their
creations to avid fans. They make
graphics tablets and drawing tools
and marker pens; movies and comics
and posters; action figures, trading
cards, plush toys, manga; leather
fantasy boots and weapons, swords
and throwing knives, and shorts
and hats - I even witnessed a tail
shop (called TellTails), supplying
detachable tails for roleplaying your
favourite animal. And it goes without
saying that the immense creativity
that goes into crafting, designing,
and building your own costume
underpins the entire event.
This struck me as immensely
profound in the context of this
community. That such events totally
rely on resourceful and innovative
artists speaks volumes about the
people within this cultural subset
– a non-judgemental, universally
accepting attitude which doesn’t
give a shit about what you look like,
how old you are, where you’re from,
what your costume’s like, or any
discriminatory reason you can think
of. There are teens and young adults
dressed as the same characters as
parents with their children of five
years old. Female Captain Americas
and male fairies pass by every two
minutes. Total strangers stop each
other in the corridor and compliment
each other on their costumes. And
Sagey’s costume was so convincing
that I only found out that she was a
girl during a post-interview chat.
After all, what can you pass
judgement against, when every
individual is so strikingly different?
Would I be singled out because
I didn’t come as a character?
“Absolutely not,” Liam, a seventeen
year old student studying in London,
tells me. “It’s 11am and I’ve already
spend £170 on action figures.
ComicCon isn’t about just about
cosplayers; it’s about anyone with an
interest in this side of the creative
industry. We’re here to appreciate
all the work that these artists, big
or small, have put in into creating
something they’re really passionate
about.”
And it turns out that people
appreciate these events very much
– the bigger the better. The London
events now attract over 100,000
visitors, only around 30,000 fewer
compared to the world’s biggest event
of its kind in San Diego. There are
visitors from all over London, the
UK, and even Europe – a German
Daenerys Targaryen and Shae from
HBO’s Game of Thrones were very
happy for me to take their picture.
A different Daenerys, with an
elaborate black dragon hovering over
her, is accompanied by Melisandre
and Queen Cersei, with Jon Snow
hanging around the side. “We usually
go to the Manchester events as they’re
closer to home,” Cersei tells me.
“There are events all over the country,
but the London ones in May and
October are definitely the biggest; it’s
not just the MCM Expo – there are
other conventions too.”
When asked how long they spent
on their costumes, they replied with,
“About a few months, spending a
little time maybe two days a week.”
I begin to think that not all people
make costumes for the character’s
sake – they could be inspired by the
costume designer themself when
deciding what their next big project is.
I leave as Melisandre gets her picture
taken with a female White Walker
who simply walks up and joins the
group. About fifteen girls in matching
cat costumes walk by and spoil the
first take.
And so every once in a while a
hidden community emerges from the
general public: perhaps consisting of
those not receiving a second glance
on the street, or those too shy to voice
their opinions; to celebrate a place
where anybody can put hard work in
and gain recognition for their creative
work, regardless of the genetic lottery
or any other prejudices of the English
society that still exist in the 21st
century.
Perhaps some have dreamed of a
utopia hidden within today’s societal
confines, but the answer may be
surprising: what kind of convention
conjoins a society of open-minded,
non-judgemental strangers?
What
kind of
convention
conjoins
a society
of open-
minded,
non-
judgemental
strangers?
Total
strangers
stop each
other in the
corridor
and
compliment
each other
on their
costumes.
