Twitch Plays Pokémon: Alive and Kicking
Tom Rivlin on the past and future of the internet sensation
"Thousands
of people
wanted to
say where
Red should
go. Mil-
lions more
just wanted
to watch
the chaos."

Remember that thing that
everyone cared about for one
week in February? To a future
historian it’ll look like a weird mind
virus infected everyone for exactly a
week and then disappeared. Let’s talk
about it again!
If you missed it, in February a
programmer created a channel
on Twitch (a game streaming site)
called Twitch Plays Pokémon to play
Pokémon Red, the first Pokémon game.
The twist? It wasn’t the streamer
playing the game, it was Twitch.
There’s a chatbox by the stream
where people can discuss it live. The
streamer (identity still unknown)
had the simple idea of writing code
to make the game follow the chat’s
commands. Along with regular
chatting, stream viewers could type
“up, down, left, right” to move the
character in the cardinal directions
and “a, b, start” to interact with
things.
The result was a stream where (at
its peak) hundreds of thousands of
people were playing one single-player
game. The protagonist, Red, turned
into a schizophrenic lunatic. He
walked in totally random directions.
He’d check the menu every 20
seconds. He’d discard useful items.
He’d make terrible decisions. It was
hilarious.
For about a week, it went viral.
Everyone was talking about it – it
even made BBC news! People called
it a ‘social experiment’ – could this
many people cooperate in such an
absurd, ad-hoc way? Thousands of
people wanted to say where Red
should go. Millions more just wanted
to watch the chaos.
When a new game comes out, it’s
a talking point for everyone who
plays it. When this began, everyone
was talking about the same game.
We all grew attached to aaabaaajss
the Pidgeot and ABBBBBBK the
Charmeleon. (The game lets you
nickname your Pokémon. The cursor
starts on A. You get the idea.) They
were our Pokémon. We were all
watching the same character get stuck
in the same place.
And of course there were the
memes, most prominently the fossil.
At one point the only item Red had
was the Helix Fossil, a semi-useless
item you can’t discard. Incessant
spamming meant that Red would
check his bag once a minute and try
to use the fossil, leading many to joke
that he was ‘consulting’ it. The fossil
took on mythic status overnight.
Within days it had formed a pseudo-
religion. The chat was filled with
demands that we consult our lord and
saviour the Helix as much as possible.
When the players miraculously used
the fossil for its intended purpose,
‘reviving’ it into the Pokémon
Omanyte, it immediately became a
deity, Lord Helix.
And then, amazingly, they won.
After 16 days of stumbling around
caves/buildings and releasing
(effectively killing) most of their
critters, they beat the main game
story. The stream shut down for
a while and then restarted with
minigames, but promising to return
soon with Pokémon Crystal, the sequel
to Red.
And then people left. Clearly a lot
of viewers were just there for the
novelty – just to see if it could be
done. Once vindicated, they saw no
reason to go on. Others were there
to troll and derail the playthrough
(was winning really the ‘point’ of the
stream, though?), and got bored. You
were probably one of these people.
But I wasn’t. I’m still watching. That’s
right – it’s still going.
The Crystal playthrough happened,
beating a much longer game in a
slightly shorter time thanks to the
reduced trolling. Then a brief break,
then the next game in the series,
Emerald. Then Fire Red, then Platinum,
Heart Gold, Black, Black 2, and finally a
game only a year old, Pokémon X.
With every game viewership
dwindled. By Platinum they were
averaging under 1,000 viewers at a
time (so still tens of thousands a day
– the stream runs 24/7). The memes
dried up.
Despite constant new events and
stories, with fewer people watching
there simply weren’t as many people
making memes. It got to the point
where chat was slow enough for ‘chat
leaders’ to emerge – people who knew
what to instruct the rest of the players
to do to progress more quickly, whose
messages could be read amidst the
cacophony. The only people left were
people playing to ‘win’, and so by
Pokémon X the game was finished in
six days.
By then a great community had
emerged. People communicated over
Skype, posted plans on the Subreddit,
and even talked about their work day
in chat. The people who stuck with the
stream had become friends, united
by their desire to collectively move a
single game character from point A to
a really far away point B.
Twitch Plays Pokémon is like
the Pokémon phenomenon on a
shorter timescale. Both started off
massive, with global media attention
and cultural awareness, and both
gradually fell in influence, leaving
behind a core of dedicated fans
who want to do it again and again.
Clearly part of the appeal of TPP
was nostalgia – people remembered
playing Red as a kid. Not as many
people remembered Platinum, or Black
2 (which is only two years old), and
so in that respect this situation was
inevitable, but I’d argue not a bad
thing.
What’s next for TPP? Currently
they’re playing Pokémon Stadium,
which has no narrative and can be
played indefinitely. There’s a few
hundred viewers at any given time.
It’s been like that since August –
beating all the games took 6 months,
roughly. There’s a new Pokémon
game, Omega Ruby, coming out this
month, and they intend to play that
ASAP, and the streamer has promised
various other Pokémon games and
gimmicks afterwards. In other words,
the future looks bright for the TPP
community, and in the streamer’s
words:
“I like to think of it as seasons,
this (and the upcoming Omega Ruby
run) has been the 2014 season of
TPP. There will be a 2015 season too,
usually the second season is the best
one, right?”
