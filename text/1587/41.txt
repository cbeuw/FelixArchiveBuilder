Diary Of a Fresher, aged 18 3/4
Saturday 1st November
Dear Diary, I think I blew it with Dorothy last night. She came round after the fancy dress party to see
if i was alright but I was still so upset about Jennifer that I sort of deﬁnitely cried onto her shoulder, and
then my zombie spiderman facepaint ran everywhere. She looked kinda confused and left really quickly.
We’re going to the ﬁreworks tonight though so I’ll try twice as hard to look cool.
Sunday 2nd
AM I CURSED TO NEVER HAVE SUCESS WITH DOROTHY?!? We were on the bus to go to the ﬁreworks
when the KnitSock team got on board. I have no idea went on and where this hammer came from but
there’s a ton of broken glass and we both got arrested because we were wearing Imperial Hoodies.
Monday 3rd
Today me and Dorothy went to the JCR for a romantic lunch to patch things up after the 3 hours we had
to spend in custody yesterday, she went for the Moo pie. She’s so classy I think I love her.
Tuesday 4th
Dear Diary, today I’ve decided to do something about all those emails I signed up for at fresher’s fair so this
afternoon I’m going to join the Badminton team. I’ll let you know how my practice goes.
Wednesday 5th
Yeah so Diary it turns out I’m not really built for this physical exercise thing. Who knew badminton was so
difﬁcult? My racket ﬂew out of my hand and smashed a window. Two broken windows in a week what even
is this? I got an APS back this week just scraped 60%, I’m wondering if I’m actually any good at science
either :(
Thursday 6th
Me and Dorothy went for lunch again today. She laughed when I said i was so bad at Badminton, it was
going okay until I may have told her I loved her. I tried to pass it off as me saying I loved the A.B.C
sandwich i was eating but I think she heard. Oh gaaawd what am I doing.
