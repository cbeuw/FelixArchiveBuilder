After trawling the fairly
non-exhaustive ‘Best Games
of 2013’ lists, I came across
a game which intrigued me – low
budget, first-person and heavily
story based. Major reviews raved
about it, so I took the plunge on
Gone Home – the first effort of The
Fullbright Company.
You play as Kaitlin Greenbriar, a
fairly typical 21 year-old American
girl just back from her year-long trip
to Europe. However, when you enter
your (absolutely massive) house you
find it completely deserted; neither
your sister nor your parents at home.
Your objective is to find out what the
hell has gone on.
The game mechanics are very
simple: you walk around your house,
entering every single room and
investigating objects, learning more
about the recent actions of your
family members with every opening
of a door. You quickly learn that
despite being able, there is no point
picking up pens and other mundane
objects.
However, there is a lot to be learnt
from your fathers’ own fiction books
about JFK, old family mementos
and, in particular, your sisters’
possessions.
With some of the items, your
sister’s voice comes out of nowhere
to provide a bit of background
knowledge – which is a relief
considering you would hear nothing
else but the eerie storm outside and
the exaggerated creaking of your
house’s floorboards.
Graphically, this game is amazing
considering the modest size of the
company behind it. Manipulatable
objects are well crafted and written
notes all have a personal feel about
them. In some ways it is a shame
that the gameplay is limited to the
beautifully designed house.
The game will take you about 3-4
hours and whether you will enjoy it
has very little to do with the simple
gameplay or graphics – Gone Home
is all about a story.
Taking such little time to complete
it, Gone Home feels more like a
short novel or long movie, where you
have control over which rooms are
explored and in what order. Without
prior knowledge it would be easy to
assume that this is a horror game,
or at least would have some element
of it – but any fright you feel is
going to be fabricated by your own
experiences of similar games and
movies.
To give anything away about the
story would ruin your experience,

"80 percent
of the
game
consisted
of me
waiting,
because I
couldn't
do much
without
Belief."
"Your
objective
is to find
out what
the hell has
gone on."
"Taking
such little
time to
complete
it, Gone
Home feels
more like a
short novel
or long
movie."
but it is well worth noting that
this game will certainly not be for
everyone.
To put a (not so long) story short,
this game is about relationships
and particularly how they are dealt
with by different people in different
situations.
The game is somehow relaxed, but
you’re always going to be on edge,
not knowing what secrets your house
will have to tell. What it lacks in
thrills, it will compensate in heart-
wrenching plot twists.
To summarise, this is the sort of
game that you will want to pick up
on the Steam Winter sale rather
than fork out £14.99 on. However,
spend an evening on it and it will
likely not be one wasted.
Gone Home is currently available on
Windows, Mac and Linux and will be
released on the Wii U in late 2014.
