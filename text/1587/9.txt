Free speech, censorship, and backbone
for the easily offended
Why bother writing an
article about free speech
today in Britain? We no
longer ban books – surely freedom of
speech is a concern of the past.
Unfortunately that is not the case.
Just last month, the Barbican planned
to launch an art exhibition based on
a ‘human zoo’ of the type that were
common for wealthy Europeans
to view right up until just over a
hundred years ago. It contained
black actors chained and in cages,
who were to keep eye contact with
the visitors as they entered one by
one into the gallery. It was intended
to be a reminder of the imperialism
and slavery that were realities not so
long ago in this country, as well as to
start a discussion about the continued
exploitation of Africa’s resources
today. However, due to a protest and
petition, the exhibit was seen as too
offensive and never opened.
Would anyone really have walked
around what was clearly meant to
be an uncomfortable and shocking
spectacle and thought ‘yep, slavery
was a great idea’?
Who are these people who are so
easily offended, or so easily led that
an art exhibit they voluntarily signed
up to see would have caused them
to do anything other than reflect on
some of the more awful parts of our
history?
This is not a one-off example. It
is true that we no longer have to
fear government censorship, but
censorship of a much more dangerous
kind is on the rise. We are censoring
ourselves for fear of causing offense.
This applies particularly to
Universities. They are meant to be
places of discussion where all ideas
can be openly talked about. Instead,
the National Union of Students and
individual Universities themselves
are regularly banning things that
they deem offensive, partly through
the No-Platform policy, which
allows Student Unions to ban people
with views they deem unacceptable
from speaking at events around the
university.
The idea of such a policy, no
matter the good intentions behind it,
completely misses the point of why
freedom of speech is so vital. Even if
the speaker banned was a ludicrous
sexist who came to the university
to actively promote sexism, surely
it would be better to challenge that
speaker openly rather than push
uncomfortable truths into the dark,
where they don’t go away.
Some people are racist, sexist,
homophobic etc. Stopping them
saying it in some areas of the public
isn’t going to stop that. It won’t even
prevent them finding followers,
when anyone can have a blog, or get
access to some truly vile internet
communities where any horrible
opinion you happen to be tempted by
will be endorsed.
Restriction of debate on any
issue implies that what people are
saying in opposition is so powerful
or distressing or significant that it
simply cannot be discussed. It implies
that the ‘acceptable’ opinion is flimsy
and cannot stand up to argument.
This is why we need to be sensible
in public life, at University and
elsewhere, and trust people to be able
to have healthy debates on difficult
issues.
This is a difficult topic. Most people
have a place where they would find
it easy to draw the line and refuse to
hear other’s opinions – be it at the
idea of a pro-life stand at a Freshers’
Fair, someone suggesting that a rape
victim brought it on themselves, or
someone tweeting abuse at Madeleine
McCann’s parents. Accepting free
speech means that you are going to
encounter the most horrific opinions.
However, censoring it, sending people
to jail for what is just an opinion can
only lead to worse things.
As Spiked, an online magazine
that runs a campaign for freedom
of speech says, free speech is the
“foundational freedom upon which
every other right we enjoy – from
the right to vote to the right to
protest – is built. Without the
freedom to think, write, publish,
depict, and debate as we see fit, all
our political and social rights become
meaningless.”
A couple of weekends ago at
the Battle of Ideas, an event
that champions open debate,
WORLDwrites, a citizen TV charity,
launched a free speech helpline. It
doesn’t offer sympathy or counselling
for those offended though - it is
intended for people who don’t want
to be victims, and offers backbone.
Helpline organiser Marisa Pereira
said: “The Free Speech Helpline will
encourage people to stand up for
themselves. The curtailment of free
speech is so often justified today on
the basis we are all too vulnerable to
cope with it, especially women and
minorities. But this does no one any
favours – it just drives backward
ideas underground, leaving them
unchallenged.”
Free speech does mean
encountering deeply unpleasant
opinions, and questioning your own
worldview, but it’s the only option
there is in a truly democratic society.
The Free Speech Helpline is available
on 0208 525 7912.
