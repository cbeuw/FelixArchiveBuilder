SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for some mistakes in
Issue 1586. These were:
- A photo in Sport was attributed to
IC Cross Country, but was provided
by IC Rugby
- Last issue, we reported that CCTV
footage from Heston was released
to the Union. Although the incident
is being investigated, the footage
itself has not been released directly
to the Union.
- Some of puzzles were unsolvable.
So don’t feel bad if you couldn’t
complete them all.
-Missing off the newest member of
the Copy Edting team from the list
– sorry Abby.
This week, another rugby team
has been suspending following
another stint of bad behaviour.
Although this lessened the logistics of
arranging our front page (literally, we
could have just changed the name of
the team from last week’s issue), it is
becoming a much more difficult topic
for us, as a student paper, to report on.
We are aware that these stories
have the potential to go national
and therefore bring disrepute onto
Imperial College and Imperial College
Union as a result. We are also aware
that it could have an impact on
those involved, who, although have
remained nameless, may be affiliated
with the club.
As an independent paper, we can’t
refuse to cover stories that are of
the public interest. We also can’t
be told what stories we shouldn’t
cover either by the Union or the
College. We are lucky that both
have been understanding of this and
co-operative, a privilege many other
student papers don’t enjoy.
Student Unions at other
institutions have a habit of meddling
with student newspapers, and can
reduce them down to an extension
of their publicity material if they
are too careless. The papers cease
to function as intended, and harm
the development of the journalistic
skillset of the students involved with
the publications and also the quality
of the paper as a whole.
It also makes the whole thing a lot
less fun and a lot more laborious for
us.
We are always keen to put across
the student’s side of the story, as we
are students too. Although it may be
easier and simpler to let the Union
release a statement on your behalf,
if you find yourself under scrutiny
from a student media outlet, do try to
put forward your take on the events
too. It might be the only chance you
get, as the national media may not be
as kind.
A prime example of this is the story
we’ve also covered this week of The
Sun looking to pay student papers for
incriminating photos of Halloween
costumes this year.
Again, students “misbehaving”
generate interest, clicks, and money.
We have sadder news this week,
about the passing of a student this
week. We offer our condolences to the
family and friends of Tian Wei Chew.
We also have some great student
news in this week’s issue too. Our
iGEM team came second in their
global synthetic biology competition,
which is outstanding.
Therefore it’s a mixed bag of an
issue this week. Read on and then let
us know what you think.
