Fashionable Women, But No Powerful Punch
“There can be no doubt
that the hand which first
encloses the waist of a
girl in these cruel contrivances,
supplying her with a fictitious
support, where the hand of God
has placed bones and muscles that
ought to be brought into vigorous
action, lays the foundation of bitter
suffering.” Thus spoke Charlotte
Elizabeth Tonna, a popular novelist,
on the pretty prisons that are corsets.
The year of the declaration? 1841,
making it a fitting start to the Design
Museum’s retrospective of the
relationship between women, clothes,
and feminism, succinctly titled
Women Fashion Power.
Beginning with a hall of feminist
icons that range from the obvious
(Joan of Arc) to the contemporary
(Michelle Obama), to the questionable
(Margaret Thatcher), the exhibition
aims to chart the developments in
women’s fashion, linking it to the
changes in their social situation.
It begins with the aforementioned
corsets, the cruelty of which is
apparent from their dimensions
alone. Some of them have a waist
size of just 19 inches; luckily the
Victorians were lenient on expectant
mothers – the maternity corset
giving the wearer a comfortable
24 inches of breathing room. One
long-line Edwardian corset employs
a ‘wide border of satin, embroidered
bows, tapered boning in the back
casing, and four strong rubber
grip suspenders’; it’s described as
‘lightweight’.
Surely things have changed for the
better? Perhaps. Trends in women’s
fashion have certainly changed, but
this exhibition does little to convince
the viewer that it has played a key
role in feminist liberation. The
‘flapper’, whose typical dresses are
displayed in the 1920s section, was by
and large a male invention. No doubt
actual, liberated flappers did exist –
Louise Brooks and Josephine Baker
are two notable examples featured –
but the trend was engineered largely
by patriarchal society, which used the
‘flapper’ as another example of the
flippancy of women.
Similarly, the icons of the golden
age of Hollywood – Marlene Dietrich
staring down the camera like a
marble statue; Joan Crawford, with
her mad popping eyes, piercing a
hole through the lens – are held up as
examples of women with power, and
yet the control exerted over them by
the major studios is never mentioned,
a curious omission for an exhibition
themed around the liberation of
women.
Other examples of men controlling
how women dress are present
throughout the exhibition, tainting
everything: A Beatles fan-mag whose
front cover promises to teach you
‘How To Make Him Like You’; photos of
Sam Cam, that most insipid of public
figures, smiling dead-eyed in a M&S
shift; and innumerable names of male
designers.
From Pierre Cardin to John
Galliano, it is difficult to move for
male fashion designers. Even Karl
Lagerfeld, whose feminist credentials
are beyond belief (moving on from
criticising Adele’s weight, his most
recent show saw emaciated white
women donning a horrific pastiche
of the Suffragettes’ legacy to shift
overpriced clothing), gets a look in.
Even those female designers
featured don’t come across that well;
the most heavily featured designer
is – as you would expect – Vivienne
Westwood, that grand dame of
anarchy who continues to ensure that
Scotland’s remaining tartan factories
are kept in business.
However, in the description the
museum gives, Dame Westwood
is said to have evolved from her
subversive origins as an engineer
of punk into an internationally
recognised champion of British
design and identity. This description
does little justice to Westwood, who
continues to be a subversive force of
seismic proportions well into her 8th
decade.
That being said, there are some
moments of clarity and vision within
the exhibition: a highlight is the
section on the Suffragettes, whose
approach to uniform could be seen
as the first modern-day example of
brand awareness. Choosing white,
purple, and green as their colours,
the members of the WSPU dressed in
smart formal wear, so that the public
could not dismiss them as riff-raff. As
was to be expected, public reaction to
these soldiers of suffrage was largely
negative, and the exhibit includes
a series of cartoons deriding the
movement.
Unfortunately, the Design Museum
seems to conflate ‘Power’ with
‘Money’; perhaps an easy mistake
to make in our capitalist society,
but one that robs the show of any
possibility of nuanced debate. We
are told that Coco Chanel made
Vivienne Westwood, the Grand-Dame of controversial clothing, is one of the women
featured. Photo: Christian Shambenait
Can fashion be a force for liberation? Fred Fyles investigates
"It seems a
bit gauche
to feature
these
designers
at the
expense of
less well
known
women
designers."
"Examples
of men
controlling
how women
dress are
present
throughout
the
exhibition,
tainting
everything."
free-form fashion popular, liberating
innumerable French women, but
how many Parisian charwomen could
afford the prices? They exclaim that
the opening of Selfridges in 1909 was
a boon for women, since it provided
an area where they could meet up
and spend their leisure time, but as
we have seen from the recent BBC 4
series on shopgirls, such stores would
only be a liberated paradise to those
who weren’t shackled to drudgery.
The First World War, during which
women filled the vacuum in society
left behind by those at the front, is
seen as a golden time for liberated
women’s fashion, but fails to
recognise that it was also a time when
women were recognised as a great
source of untapped capital.
Above all, it is this lack of nuance
that is the downfall of the exhibition.
Towards the back of the space, there
are a selection of outfits, chosen
by a consortium of 26 influential
women, whose spheres range from
media, to politics, to global finance.
On the surface this seems like a
positive thing: a chance for powerful
women, whose clothing choices are
constantly under scrutiny, to have
a conversation about what fashion
means to them on their own terms.
However, to the side of this exhibit
a series of pages detail interviews
with the women, which serve to
totally destroy any grand ideas
the exhibition may have had. In
the opening to the exhibit a photo
of Angela Merkel is sandwiched
between Thatcher and Obama, and
the description seems to lament that
fact that so much attention is paid
to the most powerful woman in the
world’s clothing. In light of this the
interview questions seem weird: why
should we want to know how many
pairs of shoes Anna Hidalgo, mayor
of Paris, has? Are we really interested
whether Camila Batmanghelidjh has
a personal shopper? I think not.
Women. Fashion. Power. Three
big themes, which could fill
countless textbooks and essays,
are crammed into this small space,
whose horrifically confusing layout
– designed somewhat embarrassingly
by Zaha Hadid – does it no favours.
In order to fit in the last 150 years of
women’s history, the Design Museum
have had to remove any nuance they
may have had, swapping political and
ethical discourse for photos of Jane
Fonda, a decision that works against
the exhibition. Ultimately, the show
features a lot about women, and a lot
about fashion, but lacks a powerful
punch.
Women Fashion Power runs at the
Design Museum until 26th
April 2015.
