Imperial lecturers in
marking boycott
Following a breakdown in
negotiations regarding
pension reforms between
Universities UK (UUK) and academic
staff under the Universities
Superannuation Scheme (USS),
members of the University and
College Union (UCU) commenced
“industrial action short of a strike” on
the 6th of November, which involved
a marking boycott.
A total of 69 institutions across
the UK (including Imperial) took
part in said boycott, which mostly
consists of pre-1992 universities such
as Oxbridge and those in the Russell
Group. This involves the academic
union’s members ceasing to carry
out all work relating to setting and
marking any assessed coursework. In
a UCU briefing pamphlet to students,
it was mentioned that this “covers any
setting or marking which contributes
to the award or classification of
any degree, certificate, diploma or
any other academic or professional
qualification. It also covers
progression from one stage of study
to the next.”
There is as of yet no proposed
end date to this industrial action;
teaching, however, will proceed as
normal. Representatives from UCU
are due to meet with UUK staff to
resume negotiations on the 7th of
November.
The pension cuts, which are
currently being disputed, were
proposed in order to make up a deficit
in the USS pension pot, which stands
at £8bn. Explanations given by the
UUK describe the USS scheme as it
currently stands as “unaffordable”,
citing an actuarial valuation carried
out by the trustees of the USS in
March – a process that weighed
up the value of the scheme’s assets
against the amount needed to pay
pension rights already accrued, which
uncovered the shortfall.
It also warned that this deficit is
volatile, and that according to the
Employers Pensions Forum (EPF),
academic institutions would need
to increase contributions by nine
percentage points to 25% if reforms
aren’t introduced. EPF estimates that
this would cost institutions £6m a
year and would result in job cuts, pay
freezes and recruitment freezes at
universities nationwide.
The UCU has called into question
the methodology used to calculate
these proposals, with the University
of Warwick voicing concern that
the proposals could make it harder
for pre-1992 institutions to attract
and retain staff. Similarly, the
University of Oxford has labelled the
information, produced by the UUK
to explain the pension reforms, as
highly misleading.
Union members had taken part in
a ballot on the 1st of October, with
78% of voters opting for strike action
and 87% voting for action short of a
strike, which included the marking
boycott. Turnout was at 45%, the
highest in a national higher education
ballot since the formation of UCU.
The UCU has also criticised UUK
for not presenting a greater variety
of alternatives, with its general
secretary, Sally Hunt, commenting
on how “the employers’ response
to the ballot was to insist that their
proposals were the best that could be
achieved and they made it clear that
they considered the negotiations to be
over before they had even begun.”
In response to the call for
industrial action, Imperial College
London’s management sent an email
announcement to all UCU members
in College on Friday 31 October,
which has since been released on
the College homepage. Penned by
Louise Lindsay, Director of Human
Resources, the announcement
Felix has recently learnt of the
passing of Tian Wei Chew,one of
Imperial College London’s newest
alumni,on the 2nd of November
2014.As of going to print,the
circumstances surrounding Mr
Chew’s death have yet to be made
known.
This is extremely tragic news
and we extend our deepest
condolences to Tian Wei’s family,
friends and coursemates.
A fully-funded scholar under
the Singaporean government’s
Agency for Science,Technology
and Research (A*STAR),Tian Wei
recently graduated with a First in
BSc Biochemistry.Peers described
him as an“incredibly helpful
friend/senior”and an“amazingly
humble and kind”individual,with
many taking to his Facebook page
to leave their tributes.
A Union spokesperson on the
Trustee Board said: Tian Wei was a
bright,passionate and extremely
competent young man with a real
wanting to contribute to the wider
student population through his
roles he undertook in the Union,
with the last of these being one
of the Union’s irst Appointed
Student Trustees.
“Our condolences go to Tian Wei’s
family and friends at the sad time.
His contribution to both the Union
and wider Imperial community
will be remembered fondly.”

outlined how 25% of pay would
be withheld from staff who chose
to take part in the boycott. It
did, however, allow members the
option to maintain full pension
contributions, as long as they gave
written notice of intent to take part
in the boycott at least three working
days in advance of the first day of
action.
The statement mentions the
following: “Imperial is committed
to providing our talented students
with an outstanding education and
any action having a detrimental
impact on their experience is neither
an appropriate nor effective route to
resolve a dispute about staff pension
benefits.”
As of present it is unknown
whether all Imperial College UCU
members across all departments are
taking part in said marking boycott;
however to Felix’s knowledge,
both the Mathematics and EEE
departments have issued email
announcements to their respective
students.
The email from Professor
Jonathan Mestel, the Mathematics
department’s Director of
Undergraduate Studies (DUGS),
stated that “...it is only with great
reluctance that lecturers would
do this, and it is indicative of the
strength of opinion... I would like
to apologise for the situation that
has arisen, though it is outside our
control.”
he email announcement that was
sent by College management to the
academic union members, citing
that “in my view, this was a very
unhelpful letter from the College,
whose tone was deeply resented by
several of your lecturers. Though
I’m sure it was sent to try to reduce
disruption to your studies, I suspect
the effect will be the opposite -
people do not in my experience react
well to coercion.”
Detailed guidelines on how
assessments would be affected for
all Mathematics modules were also
set out in the email, which includes
provisions for lecturers to re-
designate any assessed coursework
that were intended to form a small
contribution of the overall course
mark as “non assessed exercises”.
Conversely, the email from Dr
Kristel Fobelets, the EEE DUGS, was
a shorter affair. It included links to
student-targeted briefing statements
drafted by the UCU and a link to the
College’s statement on salary cuts
for union members who took action.
