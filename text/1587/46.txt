Last Wednesday, in typical
gloomy and rainy weather,
myself and eleven other
Imperial girls from ICU Pole Dance
trekked over to Hammersmith for
the society’s very first Aerial ‘taster’
session.
Aerial is a form of acrobatics, which
is becoming increasingly popular as
a fitness craze, and not just amongst
women! It’s a full body workout,
incredible for your core strength and
flexibility. It’s also been featured on
BBC’s Tumble, shows by Cirque du
Soleil and adverts for Sony’s PS3.
We arrived at Aerialand, and were
greeted by a bubbly instructor called
Diego. He led us through a thorough
warm ups and stretches, and then
we started with silks – two strips of
coloured fabric suspended from the
ceiling.
Having a year’s worth of experience
of pole (albeit on and off with
coursework, exams, and summer), I
wasn’t sure what to expect with silks.
The first move Diego taught us was
You want me to put my hands where!?

different. Photo: Facebook
"It's

workout"

a fear of
falling
off the
hoop!"
called a French climb, a way to get up
the silks without doing pull ups.
Of course, as with any instructor,
he made it look absolutely effortless.
Our attempts to climb up the silks, as
you can probably imagine, were not
as graceful as Diego’s.
Although I didn’t think I would get
a head start with learning Aerials, I
was under the impression that the
acrobatic sport would utilise the same
muscles and technique as pole. I was
quite wrong. The first difference with
silks is how intensely your hands
and feet have to grip the fabric. With
pole you have an advantage with
your skin, which is great for gripping
against the pole even if you do get
some (many) friction burns here and
there. However, silks is about how
well you can tighten your hand and
clamp the silk between your feet,
and your ability to master a looping
action with one of your legs to get the
fabric in the right place!
For a first move it was challenging,
but after a few practices everyone got
the hang of it. Diego was great – he
had everyone perform the move in
front of him and helped you and gave
advice so you could master it.
Our next moves on the silks were
the straddle and the pike. They’re
both similar moves – you have to
stand in front of the silks, wrap your
arms around the silks and grab on.
You then jump up and throw your
legs over your head [see below – sec.
ed]. Technically, the jump was a little
cheat move that Diego let us get away
with, as we were all beginners.
In reality you would have to lift
your legs up and move them up over
your head with just your core strength
– no momentum to help you!
The latter half of the class we had
a go with hoops, which I personally
believed was easier than silk purely
because it was easier to hold the hoop.
Diego taught us how to climb onto
and sit on the hoop – which again
involved pulling ourselves upside
down. This time, we had to hold on
with our knees, before swinging up
and using our momentum to come
to sitting. Thankfully, Diego was on
hand to give everyone step-by-step
instructions. Once on the hoop, Diego
had us balance sitting on the hoop
without using your hands to grab it
– this was a lot more difficult than it
sounds, as there’s a fear of falling off
the hoop!
After a few practices, he taught
us a hoop pose, where you sit on the
hoop and turn slightly to the side,
straightening one leg while bending
the other. It was a very acrobatic
pose that, once again, was a lot more
difficult than it sounded! The last
move was a hoop spin whilst hanging
off the hoop, not sat on the hoop. This
was a fun manoeuvre to finish off
with and after this, we stretched out.
I had a really great time at the
class, and genuinely had plenty of
fun, especially because Diego was so
chatty. The other girls were also all
very supportive, helping each other
improve. The room was not a large
room and I think this significantly
improved the atmosphere of the
class. It was more cosy and friendly,
compared to the industrial, steel
rigging, cold and empty room I
imagined in my head!

London: a survival guide for international students
Do you remember what it was
like when you first arrived
in London? Did you find
it challenging to live in a foreign
country or did you find it difficult to
communicate with people in English?
From my experience, moving into
a foreign country can be challenging.
It is, no doubt, a valuable experience
in life as you now have the chance to
explore new places and experience
different cultures. During my first
year in London, I had spent most of
my leisure time traveling around
the UK, visiting different towns and
tourist attractions. The beautiful
scenes and historical architectures in
the UK interest me a lot and motivate
me to explore more.
Of course there will be less time for
traveling once the term starts, but it
will be nice and relaxing if you can
spend an afternoon away from your
work and participate in different trips
and events at Imperial.
International Student Support is
running its first ever Cosmopolitan
Café this year. It is a free fortnightly
event taking place on Wednesdays
afternoons where you can relax and
socialise with the other students from
all over the world. On weeks when
there is no Cosmopolitan café, there
will be different kinds of events on
weekdays afternoons and evenings
such as walking tours, karaoke,
museum tours and Christmas events
both inside and outside London
which you can join and explore
different parts of the UK.
Also, if you have any questions
related to student visas, immigration
and welfare issues, International
Student Support is here to help and
