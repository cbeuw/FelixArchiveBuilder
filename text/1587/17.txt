Not many of us have a spare
quarter-of-a-million dollars
to blow on a half-hour joy-
ride.
It seems that nobody has told this
to Richard Branson.
After the gleaming white craft he
had hoped would one day take him
to the edge of space came crashing
to the ground, killing one pilot and
seriously injuring the other, Branson
pledged to press on with Virgin
Galactic — whis “grand project” that
he hopes will give the “millions of
people who would like to a chance to
slip the surely bonds of earth”.
Branson sees himself as a
pioneer, democratising spaceflight,
eradicating the monopoly held by
governments with tens of billions of
dollars to throw at their enormous
space programmes. Yet while the cost
of a trip is certainly far lower than the
tens of millions that space tourists
have paid for a ride on a Soyuz to
the International Space Station
(ISS), it still remains affordable
only to celebrities and wealthy
business people with several orders
of magnitude more money than they
know what to do with.
Will future generations really see
this as the start of a new dawn in
spaceflight, or just a pointless and
extravagant white elephant?
Branson’s unimaginatively named
SpaceShipTwo (operated by the
inaccurately named Virgin ‘Galactic’)
has several significant innovations
that make it rather different to
conventional space launch systems.
Instead of taking off using rockets,
SpaceShipTwo is first attached to a
plane and released when it reaches a
high enough altitude.
From there it travels to space using
its own small rockets. When it’s time
to come back to earth, the rear part
of the wing folds up, slowing the craft
down and avoiding the enormous
temperatures experienced by the heat
shields of conventional spacecraft.
This approach dramatically reduces
the costs involved, and mean that the
entire setup is completely reusable.
Virgin Galactic isn’t the only
company trying to commercialise
space travel though. Two companies

Travelling to space on a budget?
James Bezer looks at the future of commercial space light
have set (massively over-)ambitious
deadlines to send people to Mars.
Dennis Tito’s Inspiration Mars is
planning a 500 day return trip for
two astronauts to fly around Mars
in 2018. Mars One is planning to
not only land people on the surface
in 2024, but also set up a permanent
colony there, while filming it all
for a reality TV programme. Their
budget is just 6 billion dollars, vastly
less than the 100 billion estimated by
NASA for a similar project.
I don’t know about you, but I’m
very doubtful that either of these
projects will ever happen.
One company though, has
proven that private companies can
successfully carry out space flight
in the long term. Founded in 2002
by Elon Musk, the South African
billionaire behind PayPal, SpaceX
has developed a successful rocket
and a spacecraft, Dragon, which has
already been used to launch satellites
and transport cargo to the ISS, and
is intended to be used in the future
to carry astronauts. What SpaceX
has already achieved makes even
the most outlandish goals set out by
Virgin Galactic seem quite trivial.
And yet, unlike those planning
missions to Mars, what both these
companies appreciate is that for space
travel to progress, there must be a
sustainable business model behind
it. Since the end of the space race and
the cold war, space has changed from
the final frontier to be conquered to
something we can use and develop to
improve our lives through enhanced
communications and navigation.
But as governments become
weary of spending tens of billions
of dollars on such huge projects,
commercialising seems the only
way that humans will ever make
space travel truly sustainable and
affordable in the long term. Perhaps
we could finally achieve those lofty
ambitions of a permanent presence
on Mars, or mining comets for
minerals that are rare on earth.
I just don’t think the way to do this
is with the world’s most expensive
roller coaster.
