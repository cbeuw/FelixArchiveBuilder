One of the most common
complaints in politics is that
all political parties seem the
same. Douglas Carswell has profited
from the rise of UKIP by switching
alliances from the Conservatives,
claiming that the far-right political
party supports “fundamental change”
in British politics. However, the fact
is that extreme political parties have
not fared too well in Britain.
Surely, if UKIP and other parties
of the far-Right could really succeed
in the UK, then similar parties
would have made also made it into
government. Nonetheless, since
1945 there have been only two
parties in Downing Street, with only
Conservative and Labour (apart
from other parties within coalitions)
holding the majority. Both of these
parties are moderate, with the
Conservatives on the Right and
Labour on the Left. One possible way
of answering this question is through
the tool of political economic theory
and modelling.
In order to model in economics,
it is often necessary to make
assumptions. For example, an
economist might assume that all
individuals have perfect knowledge
of the market. Assumptions
help economists to model real-
world systems by simplifying a
problem until it can be analysed
mathematically.
A useful model was invented by
Duncan Black of the University
of Glasgow in 1948, known as
the Median Voter Theorem. This
theorem states that the elected party
will have a political view most similar
to the view of the median voter; that
is, the median individual in terms of
political views in the electorate.
The first assumption in the model
is that all the parties running in
the election can be placed along a
single spectrum from extreme Left
to extreme Right. This assumption
is not always true, as parties have
various policies that overlap in terms
of political alignment. In the case of
the Liberal Democrats, no one really
has any idea at all.
Another assumption is single-
peaked political preferences. This
means that a voter will choose the
political party that is closest to their
view on the political spectrum. This
assumption is also prone to issues;
we have seen the far-Right UKIP
taking away votes from Labour and
Conservative voters in the 2014
European elections.
Sometimes, one particular policy
will cause voters to move from the
centre to the wings. Voters also tend
to get disillusioned with one party
and want change; voters can be fickle
and swing their votes.
The median voter theorem has
important implications: when voter
turnout increased in lower-income
classes in 1960s USA, the Democrat
party-who are supportive of wealth
redistribution-performed more

strongly in elections. Perhaps a “Yes”
vote in the Scottish Referendum
would have changed the position of
the hypothetical “Median Voter”,
taking Labour votes and increasing
the power of UKIP, despite their
relatively extreme standpoint.
Will the Labour-Conservative duopoly break?
Samuel Bodansky discusses the theory behing political economic modelling
Currently the results of the 2015
General Election are uncertain;
it could be the first time that the
traditional Labour-Conservative
duopoly is broken. Whatever the
result, economic models remain a
useful predictor of voting behaviour.
Irecently took a stroll down the
online memory lane that is the
Felix archive, all the way back to
the heady days of 1998. Times have
changed.
Back then it was acceptable to
write in to Felix to announce that the
Union President was “utterly, utterly,
utterly fucked” at the Summer Ball. It
was also fine and dandy for ‘Colonel
Wicky, Sergeant M’Arse and Petty
Officer Jism’ to recount their attempt
to break into the Queen’s Tower at
3am one morning.
Even the news stories were bizarre:
Like the time when rowing club’s
minibus ended up in the Thames;
a pitched fistfight-battle after an
Arabian society function over the
possession of a mobile phone; the
football club ripping the plumbing
out of a pub in Hammersmith
(getting all Imperial Students barred
in the process); and the time in the
old Southside bar when the Rugby
Captain punched another player in
the face so hard that he needed five
stitches.
These are just a few examples taken
at random from a small selection
of issues from the 1997-8 academic
year. The pages of Felix were chock
full of Union Bar nose-breakings,
punch-ups, and all manner of laddish
behavior, but no one seemed to care
all that much.
Fast forward sixteen years and
we see the anti-social behaviour of
Imperial students splashed across not
only these hallowed pages, but also
the Evening Standard, The Independent,
The Telegraph, and the Huffington Post.
Incidents that were commonplace
in days gone past are now occasional
scandals that threaten the reputation
of our University and our Students’
Union.
Any reasonable person can see that
these incidents, past and present, are
not acceptable. Today, firm sanctions
are applied to those who engage in
these often-criminal actions, as is
right and proper. But why didn’t the
same happen to our predecessors?
There are a number of possible
explanations, but one of the most
appealing is the inexorable rise of
social media and 24-hour online news
coverage. Before Facebook, Twitter
and Snapchat came along it was easy
for uncomfortable and embarrassing
events to stay out of the harsh glare
that is the media spotlight. These
stories spread by word of mouth
and through the printed page of
Felix, which would likely have kept
them broadly within the student
community. Without any external
pressure, the path of least resistance
is to forget about these events,
and not to take action against the
perpetrators.
Nowadays, many of the people and
Clubs who do stupid things like this
will even broadcast their activities
on social media, sending snaps,
tweets and statuses of things that
they really shouldn’t want anyone
else to see. Even the passers-by who
would in the past have just muttered
to themselves and walked away now
tweets and shares their experiences,
making it impossible to keep these
embarrassing and often troubling
incidents within the Imperial bubble.
Is this a good thing? Well, yes. Even
though it is deeply embarrassing for

us all to have the good name of our
beloved University dragged through
the mud, the accountability of the
21st century means that normal,
responsible students are more likely
to be able to enjoy a night out at a
Union bar or a sports club social
without getting into a fight, being
pressured into nude drinking games,
or in any other way being affected by
a toxic culture of antisocial, violent
and intimidating behavior.
It’s a bitter pill for us to swallow,
but at the end of the day it is
medicine.
