Chrysostomos Meli discusses the revolution of automobiles lead by Tesla
"[Elon
Musk] is an
entrepreneur
who is no
stranger to
innovation"
You don’t have to be a
petrolhead to know that the
automobile industry hasn’t
been the most innovative over the
years. Since the introduction of
the Model T in 1908, the car has
remained largely unchanged. It might
have become faster, more reliable
and more efficient over those 100
years but no radical new ideas have
managed to take hold.
And why should they? People are
generally pleased with the way their
cars work, and as a result companies
aren’t incentivised to change. But
despite what consumers think, there
are fundamental problems with the
way we get around: congestion, long
commuting, safety, and the biggest of
all – fuel consumption.
Our addiction to fossil fuels is
slowly but surely killing our planet,
but companies around the world are
fighting to bring change and electric
car company Tesla is leading the
charge.
Understanding the logic and
ambition behind Tesla requires that
you first understand its founder
and CEO Elon Musk. The man
behind; PayPal, the company that
revolutionised digital payments;
SolarCity, an energy provider trying
to bring renewable energy into the
mainstream; and SpaceX, a rocket
manufacturer leading the way in the
race to privatise space travel. He is
an entrepreneur who is no stranger
to innovation. He is currently valued
at $9.6 billion and his goal in life
seems to be to continuously push the
limits of humanity’s technological
ambitions.
Tesla is very much one of those
ambitions. The company was founded
in 2003 and its ultimate goal is
to produce an electric vehicle for
the average consumer: Certainly a
concept easier said than done. Due
to the infancy of their technology,
batteries for their cars are sold at a
similar price to that of an average
petrol automobile.
As a result, the company, which
unlike other automakers is at its core
a child of Silicon Valley, opted to
adopt a strategy that was very popular
amongst tech companies: Start off
by selling high end products aimed
at the wealthier consumer and as
your technology matures and your
manufacturing capabilities grow,
release ever cheaper products aimed
at the wider public.
The company’s first car, the Tesla
Roadster, was a battery powered
sports car. Released in 2008, it was
the first of its kind and the very first
all-electric vehicle to travel more
than 200 miles per charge. However,
looming over the car was a hefty price
tag of £86,950.
The same trend continued in 2012
with the introduction of the Model
S, the luxury sedan competing in a
market ruled by petrol giants such as
BMW and Mercedes. The base model
is currently priced at £50,000 and
is capable of 285 miles per charge –
topping its predecessor’s record.
Despite the stiff competition, the
car has sold incredibly well across
every market it was introduced in.
It was even responsible for Tesla’s
first ever positive quarterly revenue
report in ten years, bringing in profits
of $11.2 million in May 2013. That
might not sound like much, but from
that point on investors have looked
at the company as a market leader
rather than an outsider, helping its
stock price to skyrocket over the last
year.
Tesla’s philosophy isn’t to sell
battery-powered cars just because
they believe they are better for the
environment, they want to sell
battery-powered cars because they
believe they are better… period.
This couldn’t be more apparent
with Musk’s announcement earlier
this month in California. The
company is bringing some very
exiting changes to its Model S line.
The car’s top-of-the-line models now
come with an extra D in their name,
which stands for double motors - one
for the front wheels and one for the
back. This, coupled with a very fast
digital power management system
between the two motors, has given
the car an acceleration boost that is
treading into supercar territory. The
top of the line Model S P85D is able
to accelerate from 0-60 miles per
hour in 3.2 seconds. To put that in
perspective, this is the same time it
takes the new Lamborghini Huracán
to reach 62 miles per hour from a
standing start.
But insane acceleration was not the
only thing Musk pulled out of his
hat that day. Tesla introduced the
most advanced autonomous driving
system you are currently legally able
to use on the street. By retrofitting
its vehicles with 3 different types of
sensors, it is able to drive by itself
on the highway, monitoring and
responding to everything around it.
This brings Tesla on-par with what
other manufacturers are offering for
their cars with one exception – you
can get out of your Model S and it
can park itself at your home. You can
even hail it when on private property
and it will come to you with the air-
conditioning on and your favorite
tunes playing on the stereo.
Tesla still has a long way to go
before it convinces everyone that
electric-powered cars are the way
to go, but judging from the shear
amount of electric vehicles coming
out from its otherwise petrol-driven
competitors, the smell of change, as
opposed to burning petrol, is in the
air.
