Medic rugby players have
been suspended pending
investigation after
smashing a window in a moving
coach.
The players, members of the
Imperial Medicals Rugby Club,
were travelling to Bristol on their
“School’s Tour” last Wednesday
when the incident took place. The
double glazed window on the side
of the coach was smashed with an
emergency hammer: the inner pane
was shattered, but the driver was
only made aware of the damage upon
arriving in Bristol.
It is uncertain as to when exactly
the window was smashed, or how
fast the coach was going at the time.
Several sources have alleged that the
student responsible was a first year
student, although this is yet to be
confirmed.
A source that works for the coach
company, Blue Ribbon Network,
said that the team, as soon as they
got on board, proceeded to “trash the
whole vehicle.” Blue Ribbon Network
organises, with other suppliers, to
provide vehicles for bookings made
by students and members of the
public.
Said the company on the behaviour
of the team, “Our supplier has been in
business 40 years and they have never
seen anything like it.”
“We will never book with them
again.”
Blue Ribbon Network said they
just want the costs of the damage
recovered and aren’t interested in
“pursuing police involvement.”
