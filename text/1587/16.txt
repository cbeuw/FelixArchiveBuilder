Lauren Ratcliffe reports on the highs and lows of designer drugs
"[mephe-
drone]
changed
the
designer
drug game
forever."
"What
happens
next will
be purely
a case of
trial and
error."
The UK Misuse of Drugs Act
introduced in 1971 is widely
regarded as the most epically
failed governmental campaigns
to prevent drug distribution and
usage. By introducing complete
prohibition it effectively promoted
an underground black-market in
drug trade, condemned addicts to
conviction rather than treatment,
and prevented any form of research
on the drug’s potential medical
benefits. Cameron even said himself
(and I kid you not): “Politicians
attempt to appeal to the lowest
common denominator by posturing
with tough policies and calling for
crackdown after crackdown. Drugs
policy has been failing for decades”.
It’s interesting how this opinion
changed once he became leader of the
conservative party…
Now, I’m not here as a typical
university student in protest to ‘free
the weed’ just so I can smoke-up in
my room with a clean conscience.
Instead, I want to talk about the
effects this policy has had on the
emergence and increased prevalence
of legal highs.
Legal highs, designer drugs, new
psychoactive substances (NPS)…
whatever you like to call them, they
are all substances created for the sole
purpose of mimicking illegal drugs.
Sold in ‘head shops’, they get around
UK law by claiming not to be for
human consumption and once they
have been bought it’s the customer’s
responsibility. Untested and
dangerous, these new psychoactives
have been linked to 40 deaths in the
last year and present a growing global
health concern.
NPS can be sub-divided into three
types depending on their similarity
with other illegal drugs; synthetic
cannabinoids that, despite what you
may expect, actually bear no relation
to the cannabis plant and are instead
chemicals blended or soaked into
plant matter that act in a similar way
to cannabis on the brain; stimulant-
type drugs with effects similar to
amphetamines and MDMA; and
finally, hallucinogenic compounds.
When mephedrone (‘meow meow’)
jumped onto the scene in 2008, it
changed the designer drug game
forever. During a time when MDMA
was scarce and the quality of cocaine
was failing, mephedrone filled the
gap in the stimulant market. For
the first time, a drug was being used
globally, heavily publicised and stuck
around for 12-18 months before
being controlled. Five years later,
it seems like appeal of this drug to
clubbers has lost its spark, perhaps
due the unpleasant paranoid sweat-
inducing side effects. But the story
doesn’t end here. The problem is, as
soon as one drug is banned, another
one with similar effects is produced
which is legal, leading to a cat and
mouse chase between governments
and ambitious drug makers. The
European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Affiction (EMCDDA)
have explicitly acknowledged that
misuse legislation is insufficient to
deal with this designer drug problem,
but what then should be done? There
are a few legislative options in place
around the world; In the UK we have
a generic model where a compound
is banned along with any chemically
similar compound; in the USA
they have an analogue approach
where a compound is banned along
with any other compound that
has similar effects irrespective
of its pharmacology; Ireland and
Poland have an outright blanket
ban where all head shops are closed;
New Zealand, however, take a more
interesting approach for non-medical
drugs whereby the manufacture
is expected to demonstrate that a
product proses minimal risk before it
can be sold. Clearly, these Heisenberg
wannabes are not going to go away and
current legislation is not up to scratch;
what happens next will be purely a
case of trial and error.
What do you think should be done?

Discovering the Beauty behind the Mundane
I’ve often found it difficult to find
a thoroughly engaging popular
science book.
I tend to find them either far too
elementary or with a writing style
too stilted and formal to be a truly
engaging read. Those that can be
easily enjoyed while still remaining
informative tend to be few and far
between.
One book that manages this
seemingly impossible task is Mark
Miodownik’s book Stuff Matters,
which explores the fundamental
principles behind the properties of
various materials that we see and use
in our everyday lives. Miodownik
takes the subject matter at hand
and presents it in such an engaging
manner as to keep any reader glued to
its pages.
While many books of this sort
risk falling into a monotonous tone,
listing properties and their causes,
Miodownik draws the reader into his
life and his mind, and explains why
the world of materials has held his
interest for so long.
He begins with a funny anecdote of
his first encounter with the various
properties of materials – namely,
being stabbed as a schoolboy.
Although this introduction
seems to be a hard act to follow, the
book continues with similar flair
throughout. Miodownik combines
amusing backstories with technical
explanations, maintaining the
affability and humor that engaged the
reader at the start while addressing
the material at a suitable level so as to
be interesting.
No matter your level of knowledge
in materials science, this captures
your interest without seeming either
dull or aloof. Stuff Matters is a book
which would appeal to an extremely
wide range of readers, from those
with little to no scientific background
to those who may have been in a
scientific field for years.
Each chapter begins with a rather
ingenious method of illustrating
how reliant our world is upon the
materials that are discussed in the
book, and emphasizes how little the
average person tends to think about
how these vital materials came to be
used in our daily lives. Miodownik
uses a picture of himself, sitting on
his rooftop, and isolates individual
materials present in the picture for
each chapter.
After briefly introducing the
history of the item in question
and the sentimental value, he then
jumps into the molecular and atomic
behavior of the material that define
its crazy and unique characteristics.
In this way, he discusses everything
from steel to paper, even managing
to make concrete fascinating and
PATRICIA POTHS the development of glass entrancing.
There’s even a chapter devoted
exclusively to the molecular
attributes of chocolate! (That chapter
was mouth-watering as well as
interesting) At the end, Miodownik
devotes a chapter as an overview
of the whole book to synergize the
concepts discussed in the previous
chapters, and allows the reader to take
in just how amazing the development
of materials over the course of human
history actually is.
Stuff Matters is an exceptional read,
Miodownik animates the inanimate
world in such a way that you will
never be able to look at even a staple
in the same way again. It is more
than a book recounting the different
properties of various materials.
The book is a vivid, deftly written,
and a humorous account of why we
should all be interested in materials
science.
