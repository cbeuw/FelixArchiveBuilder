2012 was a good year for Japanese
artist Yayoi Kusama. With a
career that spans more than six
decades, and ranges from painting
to performance art, her hard work
was rewarded with not just one, but
two retrospectives, held on either
side of the Atlantic. The Whitney
Museum in New York City played
host to a number of her polka-dotted
creations, while the Tate Modern’s
exhibition proved to be one of the
highlights of that summer.
Not only did she garner critical
acclaim that year, but she also
released a range of handbags and
accessories in collaboration with
fashion brand Louis Vuitton, a
somewhat odd move for an artist
who was so crucial for the formation
of the Feminist Art movement. The
price for one of these customised
handbags? $3,600. While the price
may make you screw up your eyes,
you can console yourself with the fact
that in 2008 one of her works sold at
Christie's for $5.1 million, setting a
record for living women artists. But
even if the bag represents a good deal
in comparison, it – along with many
other such collaborations – leaves a
bad taste in my mouth.
In order to understand the
relationship between artists and
fashion designers, a meshing of
ideas that can be both symbiotic and
destructive, we need to go back to the
swinging sixties. 1965 in particular;
the year that French designer Yves
Saint Laurent released his celebrated
‘Piet Mondrian’ dresses that went
on to define an era. Taking their
inspiration from the Dutch founder
of Neoplasticism, Saint Laurent
stitched together patches of colourful
wool jersey, separated by thick black
lines, evoking modern masterpieces.
However, as much as people may laud
this as the beginning of collaboration,
Mondrian died in 1944, when young
Saint Laurent was only eight. In
actuality, he was merely ‘inspired’ by
the paintings of Mondrian, and no
formal collaboration took place.
Fast-forward to 1974, and we find
Yves Saint Laurent tangled up in
another collaboration, this time more
authentic. It was this year that Andy
Warhol, whose involvement in the
world of fashion and industry was
almost a given, created a silk screen
painting of Saint Laurent, pensively
staring out of the canvas in candy-
floss tones. From then on the die
was cast, and the worlds of fashion
and fine art aligned, coming closer
and closer, until they seemed to
spectacularly crash together.
By the 1990s the line between
creativity and commercialism
was destroyed – perhaps thanks to
the legacy of Thatcher’s economic
policies – making art as disposable
as quick fashion; evidence of cultural
awareness was no longer about what
you read, but what you wore, and
artistic appreciation became as simple
as buying a new coat.
It is difficult to find anyone who
encapsulates this trend better than
Damien Hirst, that enfant terrible
90s hangover, whose work manages to
be both ‘aggressively confrontational’
and still completely marketable.
Last year saw a collaboration
between Hirst and the fashion house
Alexander McQueen, resulting in a
range of scarves costing up to £715.
And yet this is not the worst example
of the gaucheness of Hirst’s output;
that dubious honour would belong to
his relationship with Beck’s Beer, for
whom he designed a special edition
bottle in 1995 as part of their Art
Label campaign. The campaign was
launched in 1987, with the first label
designed by British duo Gilbert &
George; what did Beck’s do to deserve
this fine honour? They sponsored a
retrospective at the Hayward Gallery
that same year. The relationship
between art and industry is so
obvious it would almost be amusing.
It was not just Gilbert & George
and Hirst who took up the mantle of
Beck’s. Numerous artists, including
a contingent of the YBA group –
Tracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread et
al – agreed to design labels for the
bottle, and in the process reduced fine
art – quite literally – to a consumable.
I understand that the artists have a
right to choose what art they make,
and with whom, but these kinds of
