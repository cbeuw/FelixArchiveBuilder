US Midterm vote disaster for Obama
Kunal Wagle reports as Republicans are voted into control of the Senate
On Tuesday night the
Republicans took a majority
in the Senate in the mid-
term elections in the United
States. This, along with their
strengthening majority in the House
of Representatives, means that the
Republican party now has control
over both houses for the first time
since 2006. The results will come as
a hammer blow to Barack Obama,
who now faces an uphill battle to pass
any legislation, including the budget,
through Capitol Hill.
Republican Senator Mitch
McConnell said the result was a vote
against “a government people can
no longer trust”. Mr McConnell,
who won a close (and key) race in
Kentucky over Democrat Alison
Lundergan Grimes, will now be the
Senate majority leader, which gives
him control over the legislative
agenda of the chamber.
Speaking in his victory speech, Mr
McConnell said: “I don’t expect the
President to wake up tomorrow and
view the world any differently than
he did when he woke up this morning.
He knows I won’t either.
“But we do have an obligation to
work together on issues where we can
agree.”
In a concession speech, current
Majority Leader Harry Reid said that
“the message from voters is clear –
they want us to work together. I look
forward to working with Senator
McConnell to get things done for the
middle class.”
The North America editor for the
BBC, Jon Sopel, said in his analysis
of the elections that “Barack Obama
didn’t exactly become history last
night, but he may have just stopped
being the man who sets the political
weather.” He also added that “The
Republicans won. And won big. If this
were basketball, then we’d be saying
they had a slam dunk of a night.”
Other developments in the
election included the first black
Republican female in the House of
Representatives in Mia Love. George
P Bush, grandson of George H W
Bush and nephew of George W Bush
(both former Presidents), was elected
the Texas Land Commissioner.
Michael Grimm, who is currently
under federal indictment for fraud,
was re-elected to the House of
Representatives.
Voters in Oregon and Washington
DC voted to legalise cannabis. Florida
rejected a proposal for medical
marijuana, whilst South Dakota,
Arkansas, and Nebraska approved
increases in the minimum wage.
Mr Obama now faces a tough final
two years in power, as he tries to deal
with the worst midterm result for an
incumbent two-term President since
the Second World War.
He was also sidelined during
campaigning, as Democrats decided
that Hillary and Bill Clinton would be
more suitable to plead the party’s case
to the nation.

£1,000,000 ex-council lat sold
in Chelsea
Aflat on Kings Road, Chelsea,
has become the first ex-
council flat to sell for near
£1 million. The flat, which has three
bedrooms as well as a communal
courtyard, was bought by its former
owners under the “Right to Buy”
scheme in 1989 for the grand total
of £48,000 (equivalent to around
£110,000 in today’s prices), but has
recently sold for £999,950.
Under the scheme, introduced by
former Conservative Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in 1980, tenants

their local authority for a number of

Weird and wonderful stories
from around the globe
TURKEY: A Turkish hair removal
company used an image of alleged
9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed in their advert.The
picture was accompanied by the
caption“That hair will not shed
itself”.Company representative
Mehmet Can Yildiz insisted that
“We didn’t know he was a terrorist.
The guy is quite hairy,so we
thought his body was a good it
for our ad.”The agency took the
picture from social media.
LOS ANGELES: A Virgin Australia
flight from Los Angeles to Sydney
was forced to return to America
after a toilet“exploded”.Passenger
Julia Malley said“We could see
it [human waste] go through the
aisles-it was very obvious”.A
spokesman for Virgin Australia
denied that the toilet exploded,
saying instead that it was sinks in
the toilet.So,the question we are
asking,is why was there human
waste in the aisles? Get your shit
together Virgin Australia.
NEW YORK: The CNBC Presenter
Joe Kernen,when interviewing
IDA Ireland boss Martin Shanahan,
apparently“forgot”that the
Republic of Ireland is not part of
the United Kingdom.There was
a discussion where Kernen asked
Shanahan why Ireland uses the
Euro and not the Pound Sterling.
He said,upon inding out that
Northern Ireland is part of the
United Kingdom,“you guys gotta
get it together.”

years (amongst other requirements)
can buy their property from the
authority at a discounted rate. New
homeowners in many cases still
remain liable for service charges
should they be in a block of flats.
The scheme is intended to help
people make their first steps onto the
property ladder.
Under legislation, local authorities
are also required to replace every
property sold under a “like-for-like”
basis, therefore ensuring that there
isn’t a reduction in council houses
over time.
The former resident, who stands
to make a near £950,000 profit on
the sale, has previously lived in the
property since renting it from the
Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea since the 1970s. The resident,
June Woodward, 61, who works as an
administrator spoke to The Sun on
Sunday about her recent property
windfall: “The increase is incredible.
Right to buy was a great way of
getting on the property ladder and it
is leaving the family with £1million.”
The property, which has increased
in value by around 10 times in real
terms, is one of many indicators of
how the London property market has
behaved in recent months. A recent
study by estate agents JLL have
predicted a 30% growth in prices
by 2019 for the capital, with prices
already having increased by 50%
since 2008.
Just over a mile away from
the property is the world’s most
expensive flat, which sold for £140
million last year.
