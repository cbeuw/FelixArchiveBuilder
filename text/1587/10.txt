The votes have been cast,
the results are in, and
the outcome is far from
unexpected. The Democrats have
been unceremoniously kicked out of
Capitol Hill.
For Obama, Clinton, and their
supporters, the impending cession of
control of both the House and Senate
to the Republican Party has been
akin to witnessing a train crash in
slow motion: they could do nothing
but stand helplessly as the caucus
slowly and inexorably steamed
towards its calamitous eventuality. It
was never a question of: “Are we going
to win the midterms?” but rather
“how badly will we lose them?’”
Fortunately for the Democrats,
losing Congress is not nearly as bad as
it would seem.
To begin with, losing seats in
Congress this late in one’s Presidency
is practically a given. Since 1934,
virtually every two-term president
has lost seats in both the Senate
and the House (with Clinton in
1998 being the sole exception).
Combine this with a significant
number of already present red seats;
brimming Republican campaign
coffers; and an uphill battle against
continuous Congressional gridlock,
the Democrats loss of the Senate
and House was all but a political
certainty. The odds, as they say, were
never in their favour.
Now the ball is squarely in the
court of the GOP. They are in control
of policy making in DC and the
brazen obstructionism that has been
the clarion call of their previous
years will help them no more. They
will have to suggest alternatives,
put through legislation, and make
good on their various threats of
impeachment and prosecution.
In post-shutdown America, such
grandstanding is likely to alienate
potential 2016 voters, while failure
to do so would incur the wrath of
the Tea Party, who will not be truly
satisfied until Obama’s head is firmly
mounted on a stake on the steps of
the Capitol.
The way road to 2016 for Boehner,
McConnell, and the remainder of the
Republican Party is therefore not so
much an easy stroll as it is a tightrope
walk. They must balance the wishes
of the Tea Party and hard-line
conservatives with harsh political
realities and an ever-sceptical pool
of independent voters. Attempts will
be made to repeal the Affordable
Care act, to deport undocumented
immigrants, and to push forward
with Keystone XL with the full
knowledge that every single measure
is likely to fail. If they do not die on
Capitol Hill, then they will die on
the desk of the president. The result
will be a continuation of the same

tiresome political paralysis that has
plagued the Capitol Hill from the
outset of the Obama administration,
only now with a new party to direct
their frustrations at in two years’
time.
In the end, all that is left for the
Democrats in the House and Senate
to do is to sit back, relax, and gather
political ammunition for 2016. The
Republican Party, whether they are
ready or not, will have to tread their
new political tightrope very carefully.
It is, after all, a very long way
down.
The Midterms: Why every red cloud has a blue
lining
Recall the scene from the
Wizard of Oz where the
Wicked Witch of the West
hinders the progress of Dorothy
and company by sending them to
sleep in a field of poppies. Does this
not encapsulate a basic – symbolic
– truth about these flowers? Pace

fame, the soporific effect of the plant
has been attested to since antiquity
and has so associated itself with
the drug that it wormed its way
into the Latinate nomenclature:
Papaver Somniferum. In fact, the
remembrance poppies are of a
different species to their brethren –
source of the opiates – but forgive me
if I dismiss this as pedantry (outside
the field of botany where it is no
doubt important).
For the poppy is today as anodyne
as the charities it represents. Who
seriously dismisses the heroism of
the soldiers butchered in the great
European slaughter of a century
ago? Who can deny the living ex-
servicemen and women their right
to support? Who, in a word, would
refuse to buy a poppy?
And yet. When I say charity
is anodyne, I mean just that: an
analgesic applied to the wounds and
sores of the civic body allowing the
state behemoth to lumber onwards.
Arguments about the evacuation of
(moral) responsibility which charity
allows the state, or the general
deficiencies of social palliatives are
common enough and do not need
reiterating here; I simply mention
them to indicate my broad sympathy
with these positions. Nor do I want
to dwell too long on Alan Bennett’s
pithy remark about the cenotaphs
and the respectful silences, those
great mute obelisks of reified grief:
their true message is not lest we
forget, but lest we remember. A
minute of respect is easy enough, and
in return we are relieved for a year
of – in the words of Karl Marx – “the
traditions of past generations [which]
weigh like a nightmare on the minds
of the living.” Is it not ironic that
the poppy serves as the symbol for
this collective dulling of our critical
consciousness?
Poppies, however, have a more
chequered past. Heroin, of course, is
still derived from its seeds, but surely
the greatest destruction wreaked by
the plant. This honour goes to the
devastating effects of the Opium
Wars. The First Opium War saw the
most vulgar expression of British
gunboat diplomacy, ‘freely’ allowing
the Chinese people to consume this
deadly drug.
Incidentally, the Opium War was
certainly a necessary condition of
the devastating Taiping Rebellion in
which some 20 million people died.
The destruction caused by the drug
itself is incalculable. But fortunately

the effects were not wholly negative:
India’s trade surpluses were siphoned
off by the British through ‘Home
Charges’. These surpluses came from
first from cotton and second from the
opium – a state monopoly – which
ended up in China.
How can we reconcile this deadly
legacy – and deadly it was – with
the poppies’ pacific legacy? I would
simply suggest we can’t. WWI was
Poppies will put them to sleep
the first great modern conflagration,
and as such it was a great leveller:
the slaughter was, for the first time,
largely classless.
We recognise the genuine trauma
that this war caused on our historical
consciousness; how could we not? But
the poppy is an ambivalent symbol;
the hecatombs of the poor of the
colonised ‘East’ are left faint behind
the iridescence of the poppy’s petals.

"To begin with,
losing seats in
Congress this
late in one's
Presidency is
practically a
given."
