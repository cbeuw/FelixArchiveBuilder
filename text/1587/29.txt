The Talented Mr Turner
Acclaimed director Mike Leigh
has an array of impressive
films to his name. And Mr
Turner is no exception when it comes
to his expert craftsmanship. It is a
hugely ambitious biopic, one that
covers decades of an eccentric artist’s
life, packing the narrative full with
rich, colourful settings, memorable
characters, and a deep, poignant view
into the protagonist.
The title refers to J. M. W. Turner
(Timothy Spall), an English Romantic
landscape painter, and Leigh chooses
to focus the film on his later years.
He is an eccentric figure to say the
least, and quite the contradictory
one, too. His close relationship with
his father William, (Paul Jesson) who
essentially acts as his assistant, is a
family connection he cannot live
without. This is put to the test when
the old father eventually falls ill and
passes away. But when his mistress
Sarah Danby (Ruth Sheen) turns up
with their daughters, he refuses to
acknowledge them, despite their best
efforts to connect with their distant
father. Sheen is terrific and ferocious,
and despite being in only two brief
scenes, makes her mark with a
stunning supporting performance.
In fact, a lot of Mike Leigh’s regular

SECTION EDITOR
Katie Couric is Fed Up. In this
new documentary, which
she narrates and executively
produces, we see the health epidemic
plaguing the lives of Americans. It
spares no one, and a sharp increase
in the number of children affected
by this in particular is what is so
shocking. Yes, it’s the much talked-
of issue of obesity. We’re at a point
where more people will die of eating
too much than too little. Alarming
statistics of how many Americans will
be obese by year 2050 and how many
children develop diabetes nowadays
compared to the previous near non-
existent number should be a wake-up
call to us all.
But that’s not all. The reason for
this sudden rise in obesity is not
simply down to eating too much. As
the film comprehensively shows us,
what we eat and the options that are
available seem to be the main culprits.
The food industry that viciously
targets their advertising of fattening
foods to very young children are
partly to blame, and would you
believe that corporate chains such as
McDonald’s and Pizza Hut are able
to operate their businesses in school
canteens as valid lunch options?
When it comes to changing the
policies, certain powers that be are
actively trying to stop young children
getting bypass surgeries in the name
of profit. Money is where the power
is, and policy cannot be implemented
without the necessary votes, which
are cast on popularity, and when
popularity is driven by those with the
most cash, it becomes a problem.
The film makes a clever link
between the power the food industry
has in the American government,
and the power that the tobacco
industry used to possess. Nowadays
there are hardly any tobacco
adverts on television for children
to see. If a character in a film lights
up a cigarette, this automatically
triggers a parental warning sign
with the Motion Picture Association
of America to increase the age
restriction. Similar things have been
tried with toning down vigorous
promotion of unhealthy foods. But
then food industry experts rise up to
protest against this supposed nanny
state. Right wing Republicans (there
is added footage of Sarah Palin for
more amusement) are the ones
vehemently opposed to such changes,
and it is doubtful whether any type of
statistics, educational documentaries,
or any inkling of common sense, will
make a difference.
Fed Up makes me think of a quote
from Cloud Atlas, of all films. “Just
trying to understand why we keep
making the same mistakes...over
and over” says Halle Berry. There
are efforts being made to stop
this epidemic. Individuals such as
Jamie Oliver, Michelle Obama and
many others, despite the obvious
restrictions that are placed on them
thanks to a sizable enemy who is
impossible to fend off, try their best
to educate and reform. But it will be a
long, tough fight for sure.
actresses are back to give it their all.
Marion Bailey is simply delightful as
Turner’s landlady/later lover Sophia
Booth in Margate, Lesley Manville
proves she can do just about anything
that is pushed her away, playing the
Scottish scientist/mathematician
Mary Somerville, and a part of
what makes the final moments so
devastating is down to Dorothy
Atkinson’s wonderful portrayal of
Turner’s forever-loyal housekeeper
Hannah Danby, who is suffering
from psoriasis, a disease progression
which is well captured throughout
the film. Turner does what he pleases
with Hannah, using her sexually
whenever he feels like it, and yet
she remains devoted to her master.
What she receives in return is next to
nothing, and she is constantly around
in her silent existence, which makes
her role all the more heartbreaking.
Even the young Joshua McGuire
has his scene-stealing moment of
the year, hilariously taking over the
role of a pompous, over-privileged
youngster who fancies himself as a
bit of a pretentious art critic, much
to the dismay of Turner, the painter
himself.
But this truly is Spall’s show
through and through. In what
can only be described as a career-
crowning performance, his Cannes
Best Actor winning role should be
scooping up a BAFTA for sure, and
if lucky, an Oscar nomination, which
will be a first for the veteran actor
who has not yet had the exposure in
the States that his talent deserves. He
reportedly practised painting and
Turner’s mannerisms for two years.
And with this he creates something
transcendent. It really is that good.
Every grunting noise, crying face,
subtle movements of his eyes, his
mumbling, grumbly voice, they
all add up to Spall giving the most
unforgettable performance you will
see this year.
Aside from his unusual personal
life, Turner’s dedication to his
craft, and his endless need to paint
whatever fascinates him plays a huge
part in the narrative. Interested in
shipwrecks, fires and storms, there
is a particularly memorable, jaw-
dropping moment where Mr Turner
ties himself to a ship in the midst of
a storm. That he ends up with the flu
afterwards comes as no surprise, but
he gets a magnificent painting out of
it. And that, for him, is job well done.
Even in a very poorly state, he insists
on heading out to get a quick sketch
into his book, despite objections from
the concerned Mrs Booth.
Overseeing this all is Leigh
himself, who captures some brilliant
portrait-like landscapes that you
will be gobsmacked to learn are,
in fact, captured on film. The film
flows flawlessly from year to year,
not having to give specific yearly
timestamps of any kind, but instead
relying on how the various characters
have aged and changed over the
course of the film’s running time.
And yes, the 150-minute length may
seem like a lot to take in, but when
anchored by such a masterful lead, it
will be easy to be completely caught
up in the colourful, eventful life of Mr
Joseph Mallord William Turner.
