The real
disgrace of
executive pay

Shaul Rosten discusses executive pay
and whether or not the government
should have any influence.

other hand are often
highly qualified,
and are working
on much more
skilled tasks and
facing higher

shareholders \\

heresa May
announcedthisweek
that she intends to
force companies to
“justify” executive
pay in response
to reports that, at times,
executivesearn140timesmore
than the average worker. High
executive pay has been thrust
into the headlines recently
amidst the furore of the BHS
collapse, and the harsh
working conditions discovered
at Sports Direct. Whilst I am
not in favour of spending
other people’s pension money
on yachts (depending on who
the people are, and the size
of the yacht), I am outraged
the Government’s permission
to pay its employees in the
manner it sees fit. Companies
are owned by shareholders,
and if they want to give lots
of money to a particular
individual, why on earth
should they not be free to do
so? What is different about a
group of people handing over
large sums of money and an
individual doing it? If Theresa
May made plans to force you
to justify the price of your
girlfriend’s birthday present,
I doubt very much that the
measure would be endorsed
with equal vigour, and as little
thought, as her proposals on
executive pay. If any person
or group of people want to
pay someone several million
pounds a year, that is their
right. It is not up to anyone
else to decide what someone
is paid, except those paying
the wages. Furthermore,
no justification whatsoever
should be required if a
company wishes to pay one
individual 140 times more
than another. If they pay
their workers above minimum
wage and pay tax then the
company’s activities can only
be good for the economy
and the country, and no law
has been broken that justifies
impeding on their freedom.
The entire shareholder/board
of directors system exists to
ensure that the people who
own the company make the
important decisions, and there
is no reasonable excuse for
this charge to be transferred
to an outside governing body.
Aside from the intrusion on
fundamental freedoms, the
issue of executive pay is poorly
portrayed and represented.
Whilst the average worker
may be paid far less than
the average executive, that is
because their job is (often) far
easier and requires less skill,
pushing down wages as more
people are included in the
pool of possible employees.
justify paying him or her £5
million a year? Imagine a
scenario where you, a young
entrepreneur who has started
your own company, require
a babysitter so that you can
work nights to improve the
success of your initiative. If you
do extremely well, and are
paid handsomely accordingly,
it would be ridiculous for your
babysitter to demand that he
or she be paid more in line
with what you earned. Yes,
you couldn’t have done it
without them, but you could
easily have found another
impoverished student to do
the babysitting for you. You
paid them for the work they
did, and the fact that they may
have been involved at some
level in the profits of your
labour does not grant them
right to demand increased
compensation.
I agree that if a company
has done well, workers should
be included in that success. To
make that the law, however,
is an indefensible intrusion
on basic freedoms. If the
government feels workers
are underpaid, they should
raise the minimum wage
accordingly. Removing
freedom should always
be an absolute last resort,
particularlywhenthefreedoms
in question can add value
to this country’s economy. I
appreciate that the ownership
Executives, on the other hand,
are often highly qualified, and
are working on much more
skilled tasks and facing higher
demands from shareholders.
In addition, the value created
by each individual worker is
far less than that created by
an individual executive – why
should that created value not
be rewarded fairly? If my
company generates £100
million profit a year, and
my brilliant chief executive
is responsible for most of
that, why on earth need I
at the suggestion that the
Government has the right to
determine what a company
pays its staff.
This country is founded on
some key tenets, the most basic
of which is the fundamental
freedom to make your own
decisions, provided you abide
by the law. In that regard then
it seems absurd to suggest that
a company must, in effect, ask
issues surrounding BHS have
left a £571 million hole in
the pension pot, and that has
real impacts for employees;
however, unless the law was
broken, then only the good
conscience of those involved
can (and should) resolve
the matter. Individual cases
cannot dictate government
policy, especially when those
regulations are simply populist
in nature and deny basic rights
and freedoms.
All in all, although one may
not agree with the disparate
remuneration levels of
workers and executives, the
right of a company to pay its
staff how it likes (within the
limits of the minimum wage)
remains theirs. Theresa May,
and many of her political
peers, seem to see executive
pay as another bone to toss
to the disgruntled public in
return for favour. I hope, for
the sake of your right to buy
your girlfriend a ridiculously
expensive birthday present,
that her attitudes will never be
enacted into legislation.
