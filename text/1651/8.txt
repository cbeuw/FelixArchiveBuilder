P
seudomonas
aeruginosa is
a bacterium of
considerable
medical
importance. It
is the archetypal “multi-
drug resistant (MDR)
pathogen”, known for its
extreme antibiotic resistance,
broad host range, and an
association with serious
illnesses including sepsis and
hospital-acquired infections,
prominent among which is
the life-threatening condition
cystic fibrosis.
Key to P. aeruginosa’s
natural success is its ability
to grow in complex microbial
communities known as bio-
films, in which bacterial cells
are tightly adhered to each
other in a sticky self-secreted
matrix. This matrix, containing
primarily proteins, polysac-
charides and extracellular
DNA, confers a high level
of protection from chemical
and physical stress and is
crucial in determining the
recalcitrance of P. aeruginosa
infections to drug treatment.
In this latest study, led by
Dianne Newman at the Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology
(Caltech) and published
online in the December 8
issue of Science, the research-
ers took a new approach
to impeding P. aeruginosa
biofilms. The group targeted
pyocyanin, a small blue
metabolite which has long
been used in the diagnosis
of P. aeruginosa infections,
and which the group had
previously shown to underpin
biofilm formation.
To identify a factor that
would selectively degrade
pyocyanin, post-doctoral sci-
entist Kyle Costa, first author
of the study, turned to natural
soil-dwelling communities of
bacteria in which P. aerugi-
nosa exists side-by-side with
other microbial species. Costa
hypothesised that in order to
thrive in a natural equilibrium
with P. aeruginosa, these
other species must produce
factors which restrict P. aerug-
inosa growth.
Hence Costa collected
soil samples from in and
around Caltech campus, from
which he isolated another
bacterium, Mycobacterium
fortuitum, and identified the
previously uncharacterised
mycobacterial protein, PodA
(pyocyanin demethylase).
PodA production by M.
fortuitum is triggered by
exposure to pyocyanin and is
necessary for its degradation,
the team showed.
What’s more, addition
of PodA to P. aeruginosa
cultures impeded biofilm
development.
Whilst the leveraging of
microbial products to fight
infections is nothing new
(thank you Al Fleming), these
results are novel in that they
demonstrate how degradation
of a single small molecule that
promotes the biofilm lifestyle
is sufficient to obstruct biofilm
growth.
Pyocyanin was previously
shown to facilitate biofilm
formation by two main routes:
firstly, by encouraging the
release of extracellular DNA
in early biofilms, and sec-
ondly, by allowing cells at the
centre of the mature biofilm
to survive in their oxygen-de-
prived environment. PodA
seems to act on both mecha-
nisms, thereby restricting both
nascent biofilm development
and the further expansion of
already established biofilms.
The ubiquity of microbial
biofilms makes these findings
relevant in natural, clinical
and industrial contexts, in
which the ability to control
biofilm growth would be
highly desirable. In particu-
lar, a number of important
bacterial species, including
Erwinia and Burkholderia
(plant and animal pathogens
respectively), are also known
to produce pyocyanin-like
molecules.
“…our results pave the way
for future studies to explore
whether the targeted manipu-
lation of analogous molecules
made by different bacteria
will have similar effects on
other microbial populations”,
said Costa.
Whilst the prescription of a
PodA inhaler may be several
years off yet, these findings
once again highlight just how
much we stand to learn from
microbial ingenuity, if we take
the time to look.
F
act: If you shuffle a
deck of cards, that
precise order of
cards has probably
never happened
before.
Actually, if every single
person on earth (all 7 billion
of us) had shuffled one deck
of cards every second since
the start of the universe –
13.7 billion years ago – we
still wouldn’t even be close to
having seen every possible
order of cards.
The huge number of poten-
tial orders is the result of
the 52 cards in a deck. The
number of possible combina-
tions can be calculated using
a function called a ‘factorial’
[written as ‘!’]. This multiplies
that number by every number
smaller than itself. For
example:
10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5
x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
Now imagine that for 52
factorial, and it’s not hard
to see that very quickly it
becomes a massively large
number: 80,000,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,000
,000,000,000,000,000,000
to be precise (that’s 67 zeros).
And in the grand scheme of
things, that’s nothing; if you
really want your mind blown,
get someone to explain Gra-
ham’s Number (the largest
number ever even thought of)
to you.
