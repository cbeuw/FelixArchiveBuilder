Brazil was the main focus of
August, with the 2016 Summer
Olympics being held in Rio
de Janeiro as well as the mas-
sive political scandal that was
happening countrywide. Essen-
tially, most of the government
were corrupt whilst the rest of
Brazil was undergoing a fairly
big recession. The people wer-
en’t happy with this (duh) and
the President was subsequently
impeached. Oh, and they had
a pretty big outbreak of the
aforementioned Zika virus, but
although it was bad, it didn’t
start the pandemic that some
people predicted. Some Rus-
sian athletes couldn’t compete
in the games due to doping, the
pool turned green, and the sail-
ing waters were pretty dodgy,
pollution-wise. But, we came
out of it 2nd
in the medal table
so who cares? Arguably in the
top five highlights of the year
was the start of the Night Tube
on three London lines (two
more have since followed), fan-
tastic news for that post-ACC
commute.
Stars of the big screen, Gene
Wilder (Willy Wonka) and
Kenny Baker (R2-D2) were
the unfortunate casualties of
August and by now the after-
life was looking more and more
like the guest list of a swish
Elton John party.
Turkey had a failed mili-
tary coup in which hundreds
were killed and over 15,000
supporters of the coup were
arrested and detained. Presi-
dent Erğodan was out of the
country when the uprising from
members of the army hap-
pened and had to Facetime a
news network in order to make
a plea to citizens to back his
leadership. France was yet
again the scene of a terrible
atrocity, this time in Nice. 86
people were killed and hun-
dreds more injured as a truck
was driven through crowds
celebrating Bastille Day. ISIS
claimed responsibility for the
attack.
Brexit fallout carried on too,
with the pound and the FTSE
rising and falling due to even
the faintest of whispers on
what on earth the UK planned
to do if/when Article 50 was
invoked. The Government has
greenlit two massive projects
during all this chaos, the Hin-
kley Point nuclear power plant
and the renewal of Trident.
Good news if you’re planning a
career in the nuclear industry,
slightly worse news if you’re
not a fan of paying for electric
above the market price, or of
global thermonuclear annihi-
lation. Farage also decided to
stand down as head of UKIP
(don’t worry, he’d be back)
and the Chilcot report into the
Iraq war finally came out (basi-
cally Blair had other options to
use before war).
Sports was again a small res-
pite for the UK, Andy Murray
won Wimbledon again (and
cried again) and Chris Froome
won the Tour de France. Across
the pond, the Republican and
Democratic National con-
ventions happened, putting
forward as their candidates
Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton respectively. Great
job guys. Oh, and after not
a single vote was cast in her
name, Theresa May rose to be
our new Prime Minister. Better

The Paralympics followed
afterwards in September,
another fantastic haul for Team
GB and one of the few coun-
tries to ever do better after
hosting an Olympics. In other
sporting news, Sam Allardyce,
the England Football manager,
was sacked after just one
game (which he won). This
was after footage emerged
of him accepting money for
helping break some rules. He
was also seen drinking a pint
of wine, a feat which in my
In October we kind of got a
date for when Brexit would sort
of happen, maybe. Theresa
May announced that Britain
would invoke Article 50 by
March 2017 but then a legal
challenge was started in order
to make sure that the decision
to make that decision was a
decision made by Parliament
and not just May on her own.
This is basically because the
referendum result was more
of a poll than a binding result,
even though the Government
thought it was the latter. Yet

eyes redeems all. David Cam-
eron decided that enough was
enough with regards to politics
and left Westminster for good.
Across the aisle, Corbyn was
re-elected by Labour Party
members despite not having
the support of all, and maybe
not even the majority of, his
MPs. But these two weren’t the
biggest political stories of the
month, not by a long stretch.
That came in the form of the
sequin-adorned Ed Balls on
Strictly Come Dancing. The
former Shadow Chancellor
was, let’s be honest, dire but
he was the light hearted enter-
tainment the country needed.

was given the greenlight for a

it actually gets built remains to
be seen.

I think you can guess what
this one’s going to be about…
TIME Magazine’s Person of the
Year, Donald J. Trump. For a
full breakdown of what went
down see felix 1646 but the
long and the short of it is that
Trump took the swing states of
Pennsylvania, Ohio and the
king of them all, Florida, which
gifted him enough electoral
college votes (306 vs. 232) to
take the presidency. Clinton
did, however, win the majority
of the public vote, over 2 mil-
lion more people voted for her.
Is this democracy? I dunno.
The Republican Party (Trump’s
party) also won control of
the House and the Senate

ethos was noticeable all
throughout Charity Week,
from the electric atmosphere
at the annual dinner, to the
amazing teamwork between

Fundraising activities
included the annual Dinner

pampering event, Smoky Not

silences, head shaves,
Snowdon treks and fun-runs.

or the first time,
this year’s Charity
Week hit and
smashed through the
£1,000,000 ceiling,
as students from
around the globe managed
to collectively raise a total of
£1,057,220.12 in donations.
The initiative which
traditionally takes place over
the final week of October
sees students in London and
beyond take to their campus
corridors, common rooms,
and quite often, the streets, to
sell baked goods for charity,
among many other fundraising
activities.
Since it first started in 2000,
Charity Week (or CW as
as they align with the wider
Republican Party. Trump has
since appointed a few dodgy
characters to his cabinet and
his conflicts with business in
foreign countries have come
under scrutiny too. Some other
things probably happened this
month but the bulk of people
were just freaking out/celebrat-
ing Trump’s ascension. Oh, and
the legendary musician and
writer Leonard Cohen and
infamous revolutionary Fidel
Castro both passed away in
November. I mean the United
States has potentially brought
about its own demise so what
did Castro really have left to
achieve?
December
Brexit got a step closer
to happening/being post-
poned this month with the UK
Supreme Court holding a week
long trial after the Govern-
ment appealed the High Court
ruling. The whole case was
filmed and streamed online, it
didn’t really make for riveting
viewing though. Needed more
baby turtles or snow leopards
or racer snakes. Attenborough
had the right idea. Elsewhere
in politics the Liberal Demo-
crats finally got another MP,
one more and they hit double
figures. Italy’s Prime Minister,
Matteo Renzi, resigned after
he lost a referendum (there’s a
theme emerging here) and then
Austria didn’t elect their far
right candidate as President,
breaking the rest of the 2016
mould. Loved and loathed
critic, AA Gill died this month
too (there’s a full obituary in
the Food section).
Aside from all this were
the conflicts and crises that
spanned the entire year, some
of which started well before
January and some of which
are sadly likely to continue
well past December. The most
notable of these is undoubt-
edly the situation in the Middle
East, chiefly in Syria. It’s an
incredibly complex situation
involving warring factions, a
pretty bad Assad-led govern-
ment, good and bad rebel
forces and a whole load of
innocent civilians caught
up in the middle. This page
is nowhere near enough to
explain the situation and it’s
an incredibly nuanced military
and political struggle involv-
ing the Syrian people, global
superpowers, and complicated
allegiances. Thank fuck we’ve
got Boris Johnson on the job.
So that was 2016. The year of
political discourse, an emerg-
ing far right, a reality TV star as
\\ Will he be the
end of us all? \\
President-elect, Pokémon Go,
Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar,
celebrity deaths, the Paris
Agreement, Brexit, Marmite-
gate, and more memes than
you can shake a stick at. If
nothing else, at least the last
year wasn’t boring.
