I
have always found myself
inexplicably drawn to
books about regret, lost
opportunities, death, and
dying. Perhaps there is
something cathartic about
reading of other people’s
regrets, regrets that are
disturbingly close to home
yet safely ensconced in the
realm of fiction. Perhaps it is
the ritual of a young person
trying to pre-empt and avoid
the dark and looming future –
as if reading about them will
prevent me from falling into
similar traps of life.
But what Philip Roth’s decep-
tively short and simple novel
Everyman tells us, is that no
one plans to fall into these
traps in the first place. In fact,
these characters that we see
struggling to come to terms
with their past are struggling
precisely because their life
did not turn out as they had
imagined it would. It is a
struggle for answers to things
that sometimes simply have
no explanation.
2016 has been a year of
major global events, disap-
pointments and uncertainties
– victories to some, but trage-
dies to many others. Someone
in the future might look back
and point at this or that
incident as a turning point,
but just like the Everyman as
he is running the course of
his life, we are caught in the
present, swept by the tide
of events, and as clueless as
the next person about how
things might pan out in the
years to come. What of the
individual’s place in all this
turmoil? The ordinary life
plods along. Everyman is
indeed a depressing book to
reflect upon at the close of the
year, but for me it is the kind
of reminder I need in order to
harness the burst of energy
that the new year unfailingly
affords. After all, is not the
new year a time for forgive-
ness and perhaps absolution?
‘Everyman’ refers to the
15th-
century play, in which
an unprepared sinner is told
by Death of his imminent
judgement day. Before
his maker, his friends and
family leave him, as does
his wealth, beauty and
knowledge – what is left are
his good deeds alone. Roth’s
novel opens with the burial
of the nameless Everyman,
surrounded by a smattering
of people connected to him
in life. Once the mourners
depart, however, Roth’s
Everyman recounts his life
and makes his case for sym-
pathy while reconciling with
his own actions.
What is remarkable about
the book is the utter ordinar-
iness of the Everyman and
Every man’s read for the new year

his utterly unremarkable, and
hence relatable, life. Never
named throughout the novel,
his life could belong to any
one of us. His major afflictions
– failed marriages, loneliness,
a lost passion for painting,
and failing health – could
apply to anyone in some form
or another. Thrice married,
much of the Everyman’s
wistfulness seems to stem from
allowing his second marriage
to fail due to his philander-
ing actions. He is never able
to account to himself for
leaving a reliable, kind wife
and mother of his beloved
daughter for a woman half his
age. It is lust that destroyed
him, but even in his old age
it is lust that keeps him going.
Instead of trying to explain
away his actions, he repeat-
edly reminds the reader of
how grateful he is for what
he has – his forgiving and
unfailingly kind daughter
Nancy and Howie, the older
brother that has cared for him
and been his inspiration since
childhood.
In the throes of his ailing
body – “eluding death
seemed to have become the
central business of his life”
– Roth’s Everyman clings to
memories of his blissful child-
hood helping his father out
in his jewellery repair shop.
After leaving the residential
home he moves to the shore
in an attempt to recreate his
childhood days spent surfing
at sea. We learn the com-
forting role memories play in
old age and sickness – when
the Everyman learns of col-
leagues in hospital or dying,
he calls them, and recounts
their old times at work, shar-
ing laughter over old jokes.
He tides over the agony of
his multiple angioplasties by
remembering the watches
and clocks his father used to
sell, recalling their images in
detail until the procedures
were over.
“Old age isn’t a battle; old
age is a massacre” – the
Everyman is surrounded by
the dead and dying, and is
preoccupied in most of the
book with his own steady
march towards the end. It
seems to be a battle of mind
over matter, as he tries to
sustain himself with memories,
ruminations, and his passion
for painting while his body
fades away. There is frustra-
tion – he is intensely jealous
of his older brother’s good
health despite his devotion to
him – but there is also a grad-
ual sense of resignation and
newfound appreciation for
what he has left. Eventually
we come to the realization
that it is all well and good
to find explanations, but as
he tells Nancy, and Nancy
repeats to his spirit in the
grave, “There’s no remaking
reality. Just take it as it comes.
Hold your ground and take it
as it comes. There’s no other
way.”
Everyman is not a cheerful
read, but the kind that makes
you buried deep in rumina-
tion for a long time. The kind
that makes you stop to con-
sider where your life is going
and shakes the foundations
of your values to test their
integrity.
J
ust before the start
of the performance,
as we, the soon-to-
be-audience, stand
packed like sardines
into the small lobby
of the King’s Cross Theatre,
the sirens go off. The chatter
falls silent in the face of
the piercing wail, followed
by an uniformed prison
officer pushing through the
crowd – “prisoners coming
through!” The cast, dressed
in grey sweats and hoodies,
march past into the theatre,
faces set in grim defiance.
The Donmar Warehouse’
Shakespeare Trilogy, made
up of The Tempest, Henry
IV, and Julius Caesar, marks
director Phyllida Lloyd’s
return to the Donmar with her
all-female cast adaptation
of Shakespeare. The return
is triumphant; the plays feel
just as revolutionary, just as
exhilarating as they were
four years ago when the first
iteration of Julius Caesar with
an all-female cast was staged
at the Donmar in 2012.
The performances are plays
within plays – the setting is in
a women’s prison, the conceit
being that the prisoners are
performing Shakespeare’s
works as part of an educa-
tional programme. At the
beginning of the performance
Jade Anouka reads aloud
from a scrap of paper: “this
play gave me my voice...I
hope you enjoy it,” and what
a voice it is – Anouka as
Anthony lights up the stage
from the first moment, singing
a pop ballad to introduce the
return of his beloved Caesar.
In the background for long
stretches the opening act,
Anouka once again smoul-
ders in Act III Scene II in the
“friends, Romans, country-
men” speech.
Harriet Walter worked
with Phyllida Lloyd on the
original run of Julius Caesar
in 2012, and now she returns
as Brutus in Caesar, the lead
in Henry IV, and Prospero in
The Tempest. She lends Brutus
a wiry sort of inner strength,
from his reticence in the first
act as Cassius implores Brutus
to recognise within himself
what the rest of Rome already
see – his capability to be a
great leader – to the rather
more confident and grandiose
speeches that Brutus delivers
later in the play. Walter’s
stage experience and classi-
cal training show in her subtle
performance. Her scenes par-
ticularly with Claire Dunne as
Portia are exquisite to watch.
In understated gestures both
Walter and Dunne portray
immense tenderness. In
another extraordinary scene,
Brutus dances a slow waltz
with the ghost of Caesar as
Lucius plays an haunting
melody; at the corners of the
stage other cast members
stand with slowly rotating
disco balls so tiny sequins of
light glide over Brutus and
the ghost. It is an inexplica-
ble, beautiful rendering of
the ways that Brutus, having
committed an act of violence
and betrayal, is now forever
linked to Caesar.

former is Martina Laird as

Lloyd’s production is not only
all-female, but seems to have
employed blind casting in
terms of racial diversity as
well: the cast is populated
with women of different
ethnicities and backgrounds,
and the performance is richer
for it.
Julius Caesar is a story of
the dangers of ambition.
In some parts it’s hard not
to draw parallels between
Jackie Clune’s swaggering,
callous Caesar and Donald
Trump. Yet the play at its
core is not a reflection of the
current political climate but
an exploration of how society
treats powerful women, or
women who crave power.
Caesar is of course struck
down for being too ambitious.
Octavius too is thwarted
– when towards the end,
Octavius begins to revel in
his victory the play within the
play is abruptly shut down.
Prison guards enter the stage
and haul off the women
performing. “That’s not how
it ends!” cries Harriet Walter
plaintively, the guards haul
her off all the same.
Julius Caesar is a play of
rebellion and power strug-
gles, yet the powerlessness
of the imprisoned women
is made clear – the stage
is mocked up as basketball
court outside the prison; the
audience watch from the
bleachers – seats arranged
on scaffolding like structures
looking down into the pit of
the stage. Monitor screens
blink video footage high up
on the walls around the stage,
and the occasional patrolling
guards can be seen, while
huge caged walkways border
the edges of the room. The
staging is squalid, and at
times claustrophobic, mirror-
ing the disenfranchisement
of the inmates; yet it crackles
with the energy the cast pro-
duces. This is a performance
to be experienced, not talked
about, from the bone shaking
vibrations of the drums that
are played onstage to signify
battle, to the rattling of the
bars, to the explosive perfor-
mances, it is all immersive. I
emerged from the theatre a
little shell shocked, wanting to
watch it all over again. This is
not to be missed.
\\ The women’s
prison setting of
the plays raises the
question: who does
Shakespeare belong
to? \\
Cassius, a role which she
grows into, particularly hitting
it out of the park in Act IV
Scene III, in which Cassius
and Brutus find that all their
problems have not been
solved by killing Caesar.
Laird’s performance, like that
of her cast mates, is unique in
melding her own dialect and
cadences to the 400 year old
words. The women’s prison
setting raises the question:
who does Shakespeare
belong to? These plays are
so often relegated to English
GCSE lessons, drilled into
children who might never see
the plays performed as they
should be, or the plays are
performed in select enclaves
in stuffy costuming, amidst
stuffy surroundings, wearing
the history and heritage
behind each word wearily.
How refreshing then to see
it affirmed that these stories,
these words, are universal.
