everal students
currently housed
at Evelyn Gardens
are reporting
being unhappy
with the quality of
the accommodation they are
receiving, with complaints
coming in ranging from issues
with pest control, to problems
with plumbing and electrical
works.
The recently refurbished
residencies of Holbein,
Southwell and Willis Jackson,
were meant to be ready by
autumn this year as they
opened their doors to over
200 returning undergraduate
students. However the
refurbishment has come
under fire with students
characterising it as “rushed”
and “shoddy” despite it
reportedly costing somewhere
between £10-60 million (these
are from a range of estimates).
Ongoing issues allegedly
include overheated rooms
due to boiler maintenance, rat
infestations in the communal
kitchens, poorly managed
garbage disposals, lack of
cold water in bedroom sinks,
insufficient laundry facilities,
and poor carpentry resulting
in heat loss problems for
multiple rooms. The list goes
on and on.
But these seem like minor
inconveniences compared to
the onslaught of problems that
originally plagued the newly
refurbished halls. For at least
two consecutive days at the
beginning of term there wasn’t

After approaching College for
comment we were informed
that during the break the 24/7
Concierge will continue and
on-duty Resident Assistants will
be available for Assistance.
As for the refurbishment, a
College spokesperson said:
“Evelyn Gardens occupies
historical buildings, which
can present challenges for
refurbishment. As with any
building project of this kind,
some concerns were identified
once the buildings were
occupied as part of a bedding-
in process. We apologise to
any students who have been
affected. The College has
taken swift action to address
these while making efforts to
minimise disruption to students
living there and will continue
to do so.
“We are aware of
some reports of pests at
Evelyn Gardens since the
refurbishment works finished
and we are working with
contractors on site to address
this as soon as possible.”
any hot water. Following that
incident, the top floor flooded
due to the overflowing of the
roof tank (which is the main
source of water for most of
the in-room faucets, making
the water undrinkable). For
the first half of October,
there were no washing and
drying facilities reportedly
due to the manufacturers
being unable to come and
program the appliances. And
there’s also one report of a
wasp infestation that lasted
approximately five weeks.
“I am paying £70 more
a week to live in the same
location as last year, yet I
never had any of these issues
at Fisher Hall. I specifically
stayed in halls in order to
not have to deal with a
negligent landlord” said one
student who prefers to remain
anonymous. “Overall I’m very
disappointed, and do not feel
I’m getting my money’s worth”
Another frustrated resident
tells us how last year’s Union
President, Lucinda Sandon-
Allum assured students that
Evelyn Gardens would contain
“fantastic residencies” – an
optimistic statement indeed –
as he shows us his single room.
The room lacks adequate
storage space, so the Hall’s
management have provided
him with wire draws that are
too big to fit under the bed
and are stored on top of the
comically thin wardrobe.

tour, pointing to his radiator.
“Some days ago I received
an email from the landlord
that a contractor may or
may not be coming to inspect
the room’s electrical fittings
sometime this week. When
the contractor did come to my
room, he dialled the heater up
to the maximum temperature,
then removed the control
handle. Imagine the surprise
to return to a room thirty
degrees hotter than outdoors!
After getting over the heater-
induced asphyxiation, I told
the concierge about this defect
(who are caring, dutiful and
considerate), but they couldn’t
do much other than lodge a
report with the contractors.”
Williams ultimately had to go
to the student Hub to get the
issue resolved.
He then offers to show us
his assigned kitchen space.
The kitchen is located three
floors down and through the
neighbouring building.
“There are problems with
the renovation. They haven’t
completed the build. Issues
with heating not working,
water supply being erratic
and unreliable, electrical
problems: all things that were
very frequent at the beginning
of the term. They’re not
happening as much now but
the management is reacting
to all of these problems rather
than acting proactively and
quite often they take unilateral
action.”
Evelyn Gardens no longer
have wardens to look
out for the welfare of the
students residing in the Halls.
Instead there’s a concierge
but their duties are mostly
administrative.
“There’s the concierge to
sort out packages but there’s
no warden. There are resident
assistants supposed to be on
call 24/7 but my experience is
that they don’t have any real
powers to resolve any of these
issues.”
“The college will fund parties
and team and community
building events but what good
is this if the place that you’re
living in has frequent defects
that keep popping up? It’s
like they’re trying to pacify us
with lollies. It doesn’t fix our
original grievances though.”
Currently, there are concerns
about what will happen with
any repairs that might come
up during the winter break as.

Report sheds light on Imperial culture
And the picture ain’t pretty
Lef Apostolakis
“providing a veneer which
concealed continuing
inequalities”
Following the publication of
the report, Imperial’s Provost,
Professor James Stirling
said that, “if only a single
person within our community
experiences harassment, or is
unable to access the support
they need – that is one person
too many. These findings
remind us that we cannot
stand still. We must do better.”
We also approached Deputy
President for Welfare, Emily
Jane Cramphorn who said:
“The overwhelming outcome
from the report is the ruthless
competition and extreme
pressures that our community
faces.
“It finally verbalises
what so many of us
experience which I hope
will encourage the College
to address these problems.
“However, I would like to
have seen issues surrounding
diversity, prejudice and
feeling silenced covered in
more depth.”
The report suggests a number
of recommendation that could
help improve the Culture
at Imperial. These include,
appointing a Vice-Provost for
Student and Staff Equality and
wellbeing, creating a Centre
for Emotional Excellence,
housing welfare and wellbeing
services and providing a
venue for training around skills
such as emotional intelligence
and self-development courses
and even adding student and
staff representatives to the
permanent membership of the
Provost’s Board.
“I think it’s really brave that
College would commission
and publish something that
qualitativelyshowstheseissues
and that they’re committing to
fix it” says Davey.
Whether College will act
upon these recommendations
remains to be seen.
R
esults of a report
investigating
Imperial’s
institutional
culture were
recently released
to the public, revealing a
troubling picture behind the
shining facade of academic
excellence.
Thereportwascommissioned
after felix brought to the
public’s attention a series
of incidents that took place
during Varsity 2015, which
saw the sexist mistreatment of
Women’s Rugby.
The report aimed at
shedding some light on
Imperial’s institutional culture.
This encompasses habits and
behaviours that might include
student work ethics and study
behaviours but also our core
beliefs, which are expressed
through our relationship with
excellence. Of particular
interest were the impacts of
this culture on gender equality
so as to propose a workframe
for tackling institutional
sexism, which is commendable
considering the potential
damage any findings could
do.
Indeed,attheverystartofthe
report, it reads “the Provost’s
Board recognised that some
of the project findings might
not show the College in its
best light but the opportunity
for the organisation, and the
wider sector, to learn and
respond to the research was
considered more important
than any natural concern
about potential negative
publicity”.
And certainly, the findings
don’t paint a flattering
picture of Imperial: a picture
of pressure, ‘elite’ white
masculinity, silence and
tokenism.
The main pillar of the
College’s culture is excellence.
It’s part of the brand. The
first line of the introduction
at Imperial’s website reads
“Imperial College London is a
science-based university with
an international reputation
for excellence in teaching
and research.” Yet, this
obsession with excellence
breeds competition rather
than collaboration and
creates an environment
where the inability to cope
with the pressures and stress
of academia is perceived
as a weakness instead of a
problem in need of support.
Theresa Davey, a materials
PhD student who has spent
almost a decade at Imperial
College agrees: “Imperial
does produce excellent work
but it’s at the expense of
mental health and happiness
of the people here”
Issues such as students
concealing their vulnerabilities
from their peers, experiencing
bullying in work and study
hierarchies, and even the lack
of community spaces are all
noted in the report.
On an undergraduate
level these pressures may
be remedied through
participation in social
activities within College’s
hundreds of student led
clubs and societies. “This is
definitely a space that has
helped a lot of people through
break ups, mental health
issues, suicide attempts,” says
Ksenia Solovieva, a physics
undergraduate currently
between her first and second
year, referring to the safe
haven that the Sci-fi and
Fantasy library is for many
students. “I’m not good friends
with anyone from my year, all
my friends have come through
societies” When asked why,
the answer is simple: “It’s not
competitive here. [In your
department] you compare
yourself to your peers ‘cause
you might be working on the
same problem but they’re five
steps ahead and you realise
you’re not that great”
For postgraduates and staff,
opportunities for healthy
socialising outside the work
environment might be even
fewer and the pressures
even more real. The degree
of participation in society
events and union campaigns
plummets as soon as the
transition is made from the
undergraduate to the
postgraduate or staff level.
“Through the Graduate
School,Collegeprovidesfunds
for cohort building amongst
postgraduates, however, these
resources are very underused
and few people know about
them”, says Davey.
On top of that, there is
widespread misogyny and
homophobia, the effects
of which are augmented
by the highly pressurised
environment. According to
one of the testimonials cited
in the report, “the ‘ingrained
misogyny’ at Imperial was
so deep that it had become
normal”. The event that
sparked the investigation is
only the tip of the iceberg.
Earlier in October, an entire
campaign was launched,
aiming at promoting sport
amongst Imperial’s female
population only to land flat on
itsfaceafterbeingcriticisedfor
the sexist undertones of events
which called at participants to
“burn the calories away”.
Even prestigious initiatives
such as the Athena SWAN
scheme were criticised in the
report as failing to effectively
target gender inequality, with
participants accusing the
scheme of having “scratched
the surface of issues” or
