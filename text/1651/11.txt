I
’m tired of being alone – I
just want to love, and to
be loved” laments Michal
(Noa Kooler), voicing
a complaint that many
Imperial students share.
Yet instead of just drowning
her sorrows like the rest of us,
Michal resolves to marry in
22 days’ time, trusting in God
to find her a husband. From
here on hope, heartbreak,
and Orthodox Judaism
permeate this rom-com, the
second feature from Israeli-
American director Rama
Burshtein. It’s a significant
tonal departure from her
award-winning debut (and
Golden Lion-nominated)
Fill the Void, whose soulful,
meditative exploration of love
and marriage contrasts with
Through the Wall’s lighter-
hearted approach. But this
difference belies its similar
ambitions to delve deep
into the complex nature of
romance.
The film follows Michal’s
pursuit of love, but its clearest
focus is on communication,
and its necessity in forming
strong, stable relationships.
From dates with a deaf man,
to a suitor who’ll only look
her in the eye if Michal prom-
ises to marry him, Burshtein
constantly highlights the
distances that arise when we
lack the ability to clearly and
directly relate to each other.
Moreover, she is interested
in how we ourselves often
build the greatest emotional
barriers, and Michal – a far
from fault free protagonist –
allows Burstein to delve into
the psyche of the romantically
adrift.
The casting is vital to the
film’s success in its explora-
tion of these themes, and
Noa Kooler’s nuanced yet
commanding performance
succeeds in displaying the
balance of resolve and des-
peration the role requires. The
emotional heft she provides
is bolstered by the uniform
strength of the support-
ing cast, particularly Roni
Merhavi as Feggie, Michal’s
best friend, and Oz Zehavi
as Yos, a fictional Israeli pop
star whose small budget has
seemingly condemned him
to a mere 12 groupies.
Through the Wall examines
many issues that permeate
our lives – specifically the
barriers, self-inflicted or not,
that prevent us from finding
love. Despite the poignancy
of these themes, the film
manages little emotional
resonance. Part of this is
attributable to the plot which,
a few minor twists aside, is
fairly predictable from the
start. However much is also
down to the film’s narrow
focus: Burshtein alludes to,
and then abandons, several
parallel experiences of love
from supporting characters,
and in doing so the potential
for a wider exploration of the
nature of romance and where
we look for it is lost. Similarly,
whilst the infrequent comedic
moments are funny, they fail
to touch any higher truths
leaving the film unable to
reach its lofty spiritual ambi-
tions. Personally, all I took
away was a desire to know
who my bride will be well
before my wedding day.

I
t’s been a rough year to be an
American – the political system
and U.S. election has divided our
country in a way worse than I
have ever seen.
That’s why of all of this year’s
films I watched this year, Sully was
my favorite.
Consider the following fact the
movie illustrates: a pilot landed a jet
plane, with both engines burnt out,
on the Hudson River, and everyone
survived.
Director Clint Eastwood’s depiction of the
‘Miracle on the Hudson’ is a moving piece
that demonstrates one of the most miracu-
lous rescues of the 21st
century. His ability

T
his has been a good year for soulful films
exploring the challenges faced in all walks
of life. American Honey, from British director
Andrea Arnold, brilliantly evokes the lives
and struggles of itinerant American magazine
sellers of all things. Arnold’s greatest triumph
is in showing how what begins as a promising escape
from poverty morphs into an unrelenting trap, leaving
its victims stuck in a rootless existence. The loss of home
and livelihood is also examined, albeit very differently,
in Ira Sach’s Little Men. Juxtaposing the increasingly
fraught relationship between an landlord and tenant with
the burgeoning friendship between their sons, the film
explores the harsh collision between youthful naiveté and
financial reality, showing the painfully human impacts
of gentrification.
Not all the year’s films were so melancholic,
and Hail, Caesar! was the Coen brother’s wry
and amusing take on Hollywood’s golden age
through the eyes of “fixer” Eddie Mannix.
A hodgepodge of pastiche, the film lovingly
mocks the pictures of the era. A film that uses,
rather than celebrate, the fantasy of cinema,
Tale of Tales brings interwoven fairy tales to life
with a wonderful cast including the redoubtable
Toby Jones. Yet when all is said and done it’s almost
Christmas, and Wes Anderson’s short Come Together
is the most heart-warming thing you’ll see these holidays,
besides the Muppet Christmas Carol.

to incorporate everyone, from first responders on the river to air traffic
control, shows the amount of work it required to ensure the lives of all
155 lives on board were secured.
Tom Hanks is his usual self, with an impressive performance as Chel-
sea Sullenberger, the pilot who landed the aircraft. The rest of the cast
delivers solid performances during a 96-minute film that is well-paced.
True to the events of January 15th
, 2009, the film is mostly accurate,
although tensions between the NTSB and Sullenberger were under-
standably drummed up for the big screen. That being said, this film is
a reason to escape and remember there is good in the world – given
this past year, that’s a much-needed change of pace.

iven all the horror that
has been going on in
2016, cinema can provide
an escape from the real
world, a cathartic outlet
for all our emotions, or
a means of interrogating what we think
about the world. This year of film varied,
from the dark settings of The Witch and
Son of Saul, to the magnificent escapism
of Youth and Paterson, to the beguiling
strangeness of Embrace of the Serpent
and Evolution. Julieta marked a return
to form for Almodóvar, his best film
since Volver, while Charlie Kaufman’s
Anomalisa and Todd Solondz’s Weiner-
Dog asked us how much we are able to
empathise with horrible protagonists.
Our Little Sister, the 10th
film from
Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda,
takes the top spot for its pure escapism:
centring around three sisters living in
Kamakura, who decide to take in their
younger half-sister following their father’s
funeral, Our Little Sister follows the sis-
ters throughout the course of a year.
The drama is, relatively, drama-free;
there are no critical denouements,
no betrayals – instead all we have
are a group of people, sharing
their lives with each other, chat-
ting, and eating. My god, the
eating. Our Little Sister reveals
the intimate links between food
and love, between cooking and
the seasons, creating a feast for the
palate and the senses. It’s a film that
is completely generous, which gives
itself over completely to the audience,
allowing us to bask in its gentle warmth.

T
his year was, for better or
worse, a big year for the movie
industry. It was the year that
Leonardo DiCaprio won his
Oscar for The Revenant; his
dreams will, finally, no longer
be haunted by shadowy golden figures
dancing tauntingly close. Sadly, this was
overshadowed by the many losses of
many movie greats: legends like Gene
Wilder, Kenny Baker, Alan Rickman, and
David Bowie (remember Labyrinth?) –
as well as newer faces such as Anton
Yelchin – will sadly never again grace
our screens. They will be missed.
The films that were released over the
past year had the usual mix of medioc-
rity, a few diamonds, and some absolute
stinkers. I’m sorry, you will NEVER
convince me that Sausage Party is a
philosophical look at existential crises
– it was awful. And don’t even get me
started on Trolls. So, as this year has
been bad enough, we will focus on the
good. Here’s the roundup of 10 of the
best films of 2016. There are a few warm,
cuddly films to remedy this stinker of a
year such as Zootopia and Finding Dory.
There are a few true originals (this was
a very sequel-y/revival-y year) with the
most interesting being Arrival and the
most entertaining being La La Land. I
would recommend any of these films but
please think of the setting: don’t watch
Deadpool with your family, don’t watch
Arrival in the dark, and don’t watch Fan-
tastic Beasts with muggles. You’ve been
warned.
I
f there’s one thing that can be said in
favour of 2016, probably one of the all-
round worst years most people reading this
have lived through, it’s that it didn’t let us
down in the movie department. It took a
while to get through the early-year slump
left in the wake of the UK releases of Oscar
contenders like The Hateful Eight and the
hilarious, terrifying, gloriously madcap ride
of The Big Short, and there were only a few
great flicks that kept movie lovers sustained
throughout the year (a couple of these came
in the form of heartfelt, spellbinding old-school
sci-fi Midnight Special, and the perfectly-
pitched buddy cop comedy The Nice Guys
that showcased Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling,
and writer-director Shane Black all at their
high-octane best).
But the tail-end of the year saw the releases
of a slew of stone-cold gems and instant clas-
sics; the abstract yet tear-jerking Nick Cave
documentary One More Time With Feeling;
the heartbreaking and perfectly-acted Ken
Loach welfare drama I, Daniel Blake; and
best of all, the breathtaking, beautifully
epic yet desperately intimate American
Honey. Picking between The Big Short and
American Honey for the year’s best film
was extremely difficult as both are utterly
essential for very different reasons: The
Big Short grippingly tells an important
story about the recent stock market crash
and warns how easy it would be for it to
happen again, but American Honey is a true
moviegoing experience. As three of the most
absorbing and refreshing hours I have ever
spent in a cinema, it would be simply unfair
not to call it my top film of the year.
