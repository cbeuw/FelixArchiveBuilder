How to build Hogwarts
2009 | The first gingerbread
We weren’t ambitious. We built a cute little gingerbread house. It only took one batch of gingerbread and a few sweets for
decoration, and it disappeared remarkably quickly. How things were to change!
2010 | The castle
This took two whole batches of gingerbread. We wanted to top the previous
year, and this seemed like the obvious next step. We were so impressed at the time
with the four towers, complete with crenelations.
2011 | The bridge
This used gingercake to create a valley and gingerbread created the suspension
bridge spanning the gap. The first creation that required significant architectural
planning, although decoration was less exciting.
2012 | The train
We had to scale down the production during baking because we hadn’t considered that the size of the oven was a limiting
factor. Still, we produced a three-carriage train with a single piece cylindrical body for the engine. Unfortunately, there
was a roof collapse in one of the carriages, causing the creation to have a plot line of being invaded by alien mice.
2013 | St Basil’s Cathedral (which is not the
Kremlin, FYI)
The first of the truly ambitious biscuit architecture. Consisting of eight towers,
each topped with an onion dome, with colours and patterns carefully repro-
duced to match the original. It weighed 40kg, and it was beautiful. Decorative
Easter eggs included an homage to Petr Pavlensky, who nailed his scrotum to
Red Square, and a LGBT+ pride mural on the outer walls.
2015 | La Sagrada Familia (completed
design)
Some said it was stupid to attempt to recreate (to scale) a
building that has been under construction for 134 years and isn’t
even half built. It was a titan of modular construction, weighing in
at around 70kg, with more than 500 individual pieces. Each of
the eighteen towers were built to scale, and the main body of the
cathedral was complete with stained glass. Unfortunately, we ran
out of time to finish the facades, but it was by far the most impres-
sive creation so far.
2016 | Hogwarts
We’d tried scaling up, and we couldn’t keep adding towers, so this was the year of technical baking. The
challenge: build all the towers as cylindrical and conical pieces. With several towers of different sizes, halls,
courtyards, and even an owlery, we spent weeks ahead of time drawing blueprints and crafting moulds. As
an added challenge, we gave the whole thing a base of cake to add landscape, and the decorative attention
to detail included a quidditch pitch, a somewhat questionable Dark Mark, and a student who may or may not
be escaping from the Giant Squid. This creation weighed in at more than 100kg, and posed new challenges of
confectionery distribution, as cake really doesn’t keep as long as gingerbread.
It all started as friends in halls. The Christmas tradition started in 2008,
and by 2009 we’d first discovered gingerbread together. Since then, it’s
escalated, trying to be bigger and better each year. In a true Imperial
spirit, we’ve taken a scientific, competitive approach.
What you’ll need to
make Hogwarts
72.5 batches of cake (145 eggs)
37 batches of gingerbread
16kg royal icing sugar
1 litre lemon juice
16 batches of buttercream
Sweets: we used 12kg
Tessa Davey, Beth Sheldon, and Susie Carlson
Ingredients:
454g plain flour
227g soft brown sugar
170g margarine
1 egg
4 tbsp golden syrup
2 tbsp dried ginger
1 tbsp cinnamon
Ingredients:
The cake
125g butter (or
margarine)
125g caster sugar
125g self-raising flour
2 eggs
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
Pumpkin spice butter-
cream
225g butter, softened
½ can pureed pumpkin
1 kg icing sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
½ tsp nutmeg
Apple cinnamon but-
tercream
500g butter, softened
1.2 kg icing sugar
2 tbsp applesauce
1 tbsp vanilla extract
2 tsp cinnamon
¼ tsp fine salt
3 tbsp lukewarm water
The gingerbread
Using your hands or a mixer
(we recommend a mixer
for large quantities), mix
together all the ingredients
until it forms an even ball.
Make sure that the sugar
and margarine are evenly
distributed throughout. Roll
The cake
We kept it simple with
vanilla sponge and jazzed
it up with flavoured but-
tercreams, but you could
substitute any flavourings to
the sponge. Using a mixer,
add all the ingredients and
mix until well combined and
very light and airy. For best
results, it should have taken
on a mousse-like consistency.
If preparing by hand, first
cream together the butter
and sugar, before gradually
introducing the remaining
ingredients, beating con-
stantly. Pour into a baking
paper lined tin, and bake at
175°C (fan) for around 15-20
minutes, depending on the
thickness of the cake, until
a skewer comes out clean.
We scaled this up to five-
egg batches, which took 28
minutes to bake in a 35x24cm
cake tin.
To make the buttercreams,
beat together all of the ingre-
dients and mix until smooth.
Use them as layering between
sponges, and to coat the
outside of the cake. If desired,
add food colouring – you
may have to add extra icing
sugar to compensate.
The templates
First, you need to make
your design, and draw some
templates. These days, we use
CAD software for the more
complex shapes, but most
things can be easily sketched
out on a piece of paper
with the use of some basic
geometry.
How to start your first gingerbread construction
out to the desired thickness
– just over half a centimetre
for gingerbread men, just
under half a centimetre for
construction. To get the best
results, roll out between
sheets of baking paper
(watch out for creasing). Bake
at 180°C for 8-10 minutes
(for soft gingerbread biscuits),
or slightly longer for larger
construction pieces. You want
an even, dark colour all over
the biscuit – you should be
able to see when it is cooked.
Our largest pieces (around
40x40cm) took around 18
minutes to bake, but in my
experience, this is very oven
dependent.
Assembly and decoration
Once all the gingerbread
pieces have cooled on wire
racks, you can start building.
To assemble your ginger-
bread masterpiece, you’re
going to need some glue.
In the spirit of gingerbread
assembly, there must be
nothing that is not edible
on the construction when
When building things out
of gingerbread, some level
of care and precision is
required. As you scale up the
operation, the importance
of this increases, and several
other factors come into play.
As the engineers out there
may have identified, these
it is unveiled. This means
edible glue. For the strength
required, you’re going to
need royal icing. You can
make this with regular icing
sugar and egg whites, but
for consistency, royal icing
sugar and enough lemon
juice to bring it together into
a stiff, barely pipable paste
do the job just fine. Put it into
a piping bag (you can make
one by folding some baking
paper and cutting off the end)
and start assembling your
gingerbread. The icing will
soften in your hands, so if it
feels a little stiff at first, don’t
worry.
Start by sticking the first
pieces to your base (we
recommend assembling on
baking paper), and then seal
any edges between them.
Wait for each layer to set (for
around 15 minutes) before
adding more pieces above it.
Once your assembly is com-
plete, use royal icing to glue
edible decorations all over
your beautiful masterpiece.
problems include (1) the swell-
ing of the gingerbread during
the bake, (2) the strength and
weightbearing requirements
of the individual pieces, and
(3) the choice between flat
and curved pieces.
The gingerbread growth
problem
No matter how carefully
you cut out your stencils, the
shape you put into the oven
is not going to be quite the
shape that you get out. This
isn’t always a huge problem,
but if you’re a perfectionist,
you can fix it. Gingerbread
comes out of the oven soft,
and then hardens as it cools,
so you have some time.
Using a sharp knife, trim
back any edges that need to
be straight, or even use the
stencil to reshape the biscuit.
You can do this at any point
during the second half of the
baking time, or straight away
when it comes out the oven.
The tensile strength of
gingerbread
Who hasn’t thought about
taking some cookies into the
lab and testing them out on
an Instrom machine? Well,
we didn’t do it for you, but we
do have years of experience
in baking the gingerbread
differently to achieve different
strength properties. Thicker,
softer gingerbread is more
delicious, but has a tendency
to bow if it needs to support
more than one layer above it.
The solution: thinner, crisper
pieces. Roll slightly thinner,
and bake longer at a cooler
temperature, and at optimum
conditions, the gingerbread
will form a hard, glass-like
solid. It’s not so good for
eating (yet), but it’s great
for building. ‘Structural’
gingerbread, as we call it, will
actually soften into delicious
gingerbread after a day or
so, so by baking in this way,
you don’t have to be wasting
food.
By doing this, as well as
applying some basic engi-
neering principles such as
using cross-pieces to minimise
weight load, and bracing
any pieces that seem to be
struggling, you can build
a veritable Tower of Babel
out of gingerbread without
problems.
The new 3D printing
If constructing a building
out of flat, rectangular pieces
is like first year, baking solid
3D shapes successfully is
worth a PhD. We’ve spent
years working on a seamless
gingerbread curve, and
we’ve learnt that getting it
right means requires constant
attention, fairly serious burns,
and carefully thought out
moulds. Moulds should be
as solid as possible, easy to
place the gingerbread on
to, and very easy to take the
gingerbrad off. Ideally, allow
airflow within the mould for
an even bake.
Bake it low and slow, but
watch out that the ginger-
bread doesn’t stretch too
much during the baking. You
may need to reshape and
touch up the piece when it’s in
the oven. Trim where needed,
and if any cracks appear, you
can patch them with dough
within the first eight minutes
or so.
