I
t was an early rise.
Apparently too early
for some of our squad.
We embarked on our
journey to the University
of East Anglia Pirates
with a heavily depleted squad
and a hubris that we would
make them walk the plank
once again.
The game started slow with
the Pirates’ offense unable
to move the ball, a contin-
ual theme for the first half.
Many players played both
ways, with ‘not so cuddly’
Teddy playing o-line as well
as linebacker. The change
of position can be attributed
to fondness for the greasy
chicken good good. With
great blocking and tackling
(flying across the field to
rumple both the player RIP
and himself) he attained over-
all MVP. In the second quarter
the ever-beastly Jason Patrick
‘Kill’em’ made an insane read
picking the Pirates for a pick
six. Shortly afterwards a QB
sneak got him into the end
zone again bringing the score
to 12-0. Jason was awarded
Offensive MVP for his great
plays and accurate and pow-
erful passes.
The start of the second
half saw a flatter Immortals
defence take the field. Luckily
great sacks by Defensive
MVP Harry ‘one true
greb’ Lawrence, and some
questionable throws by the
Pirates’ QB turned the ball
over. Nerves plagued Jason’s
kicking ability. A kick that
barely moved across the line
of scrimmage was caught by
a Pirates’ player dangerously
close to Immortals end zone.
Great hustle from Rookie
Ben O’Brien (who got the
Special teams’ MVP for this
play) brought the Pirate
down before making it to the
end zone. Immortals offense
really struggled to move the
ball despite great blocking
from rookie Gatis ‘Fatis ;)‘
Ogle, who was awarded Line
MVP. No more points were
scored by Immortals for the
rest of the game. Late into
the fourth quarter a lapse in
Immortals Defence concentra-
tion meant that a ball floated
over the secondary and was
caught by Pirates in Immortals
end zone. Final score 12-6.

L
ast Saturday saw
London host the
Jiu Jitsu grading.
If competitions are
scary, then gradings
are a halloween
movie marathon with the
lights off and the creepy
neighbour wearing his Freddy
Krueger outfit staring through
the window.
A grading is the opportunity
for any member of a Jitsu club
(from the JiuJitsu Founda-
tion) to level up and get their
next belt: novices becoming
yellows, yellows becoming
oranges, and so on. You can
even try to double grade (skip
a belt) if you’re very keen.
You can graduate every three
months up to your purple belt
but then it’s at least six month
between each belt, and finally
more than a year between
brown and black belt.
The whole point is to impress
the panel of instructors
gathered specially for the
grading, so they give you that
belt you’ve been working so
hard for. This year novices
were evaluated for more than
two hours, and all the higher
grades for three hours mini-
mum. I’m not going to lie, it
is very hard and very intense
(insert innuendo). Jitsukas
are examined on their tech-
nique and knowledge of the
syllabus (the higher you go,
the more you need to know)
as well as demonstrating all
that under pressure, and their
attacking on other jitsukas.
During the grading there
will be times when you can
demonstrate the technique in
pairs, slowly, and times when
you will be put under pres-
sure and have to deal with
the attackers quickly.
To recap, in a grading
you need to be calm and in
control, know your stuff, AND
KEEP UP THE INTENSITY! If
the main instructor notices
any drop in intensity, the
participants are going to stay
there for a very, very long
time… The aim of the instruc-
tors is to push everyone to
their limits, to see how much
they actually know the jitsu
they need to know.
Anyway, after the hard
stuff comes the fun stuff:
after-grading party! Time
to let loose and buy a drink
for that person from King’s
or Queen Mary’s that you
punched in the face a bit too
hard. Also, time to know if
you’ve succeeded and got
your new belt or not, then
you can celebrate. Or drown

wins to one (overtime) loss.
We are in playoff conten-
tion, but well aware of tough
games ahead. This game we
went with 23 players against
a team of approximately 40.
We need more recruits. No
matter what your size, experi-
ence etc, if you are interested
be sure to get in touch. Check
