J
Cole’s last album
release, 2014
Forest Hills Drive,
received critical
acclaim and was
met with exceptional
commercial success, making it
the first LP in 25 years to sell
over a million copies without
a guest appearance. On
November 27th
2015, J. Cole
and Kendrick Lamar raised
fans’ hopes of finally hearing
their rumoured joint album by
simultaneously dropping their
Black Friday freestyles over
each other’s beats. On Cole’s
Black Friday he had his fans’
hearts racing by ending the
song with, “But this February,
bet shit get scary when I fuck
around and drop…”, however
February 2016 came and
went and shit did not get
scary… J. Cole had gone
into recluse mode. In July
2016, J. Cole featured on DJ
Khaled’s monster Major Key
album, appearing on fifth
track, Jermaine’s Interlude
exploring topics ranging
from police brutality to his
internal struggle. He ends his
verse toying with the idea of
retirement- “Said all I could
say, now I play with thoughts
of retirement”- which had
fans worried that we’ve heard
the last of J. Cole, especially
given his well-documented
dislike for the fame which
accompanies commercial
success in the music industry.
The fans’ excitement was
practically palpable when,
on December 1st, the artwork
and track listing of J. Cole’s
latest offering, 4 Your Eyez
Only, were made available
for pre-order. The album
was eventually released last
Friday, marking the two-year
anniversary of the release of
2014 Forest Hills Drive and
came with little promotion,
save for a 40-minute
documentary Eyez and two
teaser tracks, False Prophets
and Everybody Dies. These
tracks didn’t make the album,
but still made waves, laden
with subliminal disses aimed
at the likes of Kanye West,
Wale and the so-called new
school of hip-hop.
Once again, Cole has
opted to go solo and release
an album with no guest
appearances. The album’s
title references 2Pac’s classic
All Eyez On Me, with both
of these marking the two
rappers’ fourth studio albums
respectively. Within hours
of its release, a fan theory
suggested the underlying
narrative of the album tells
the true story of the life of
J. Cole’s late friend, James
McMillan Jr. (Cole may have
changed the name to honour
his late friend’s memory), as
he goes from selling drugs
and generally leading a life
of crime to falling in love,
having a daughter and
attempting to turn his life
around. This theory has since
been confirmed by J. Cole’s
producer, Elite.
The album opener, For
Whom the Bell Tolls, is much
like the intro tracks to Cole’s
previous albums in that it is a
melodic slow jam. The song
refers to the ringing of funeral
bells and the title references
Ernest Hemingway’s 1940
novel of the same name. Like
Hemingway’s novel, this song
centres on themes of death
and suicide and serves as
a dark introduction to the
relationships and love. The
keener listeners amongst you
might notice that the beat is
almost identical to that behind
Bryson Tiller’s Exchange
and this has sparked beef
between producers Boi-1da,
Vinylz and ForeignTeck over
who originally produced the
ethereal infectious beat. The
fourth track, “Ville Mentality”,
returns to the narrative. Cole
has previously mentioned
Ville mentality, describing
it as the misconception that
opportunity is not present
in his small town. The track
includes a spoken interlude
from a little girl telling us
about her dead father. This
leads nicely into the stunning
She’s Mine, Pt.1, in which
Cole focuses on falling in
love. Foldin Clothes and the
second part, She’s Mine, Pt.
2, further explore the themes
of love and fatherhood and
their power to inspire a man
to make a change in his life
and reassess his priorities in
life. “You are now the reason
that I fight// I ain’t never
did nothing this right in my
whole life”. On the sixth track
Change, Cole talks about
maturing from the mind state
shown in tracks like Immortal
and also reveals his guilt over
James’ murder at age 22.
In the song’s outro, we hear
a news report about James’
murder and the re-enact-
ment of James’ funeral. The
seventh track, Neighbours,
briefly departs the narrative
so Cole can tell a story from
his own perspective and
touch on the broader topic
of race relations in America.
The true story refers to an
incident where a house in
North Carolina that Cole
had rented for studio use
was raided by a SWAT team
following complaints from
neighbours. Upon seeing so
many black people coming
and going from the property
in the predominantly white
neighbourhood, the neigh-
bours assumed that the house
was being used to produce
and sell drugs. The album
ends with the nine-minute
outro 4 Your Eyez Only, in
which J. Cole reveals the
album was created by James
for his daughter to listen to
after he dies: “Write my story
down and if I pass// Go play
it for my daughter when she
ready// And so I’m leaving
you this record for your eyes
only”. In the track, he reveals
James’ worst fear that his
daughter will one day come
home from school to see
on the news that he’s been
killed. This fear unfortunately
came to pass, as the final
verse is told from J. Cole’s
perspective.
In the current hip-hop
culture, it is refreshing to hear
a calm album with no rec-
ognisable hype tunes which
discusses more pertinent
subject matter.

album. In the second track,
Immortal, Cole spits some
lyrical heat and continues to
explore the theme of death
while also lamenting the
popular misconception that,
to be a successful black man
in America, you have to deal
drugs or be an athlete or
musician: “They tellin’ niggas
sell dope, rap or go to NBA,
in that order// It’s that sort
of thinkin’ that been keepin’
niggas chained”. The third
track, Deja Vu, briefly departs
from the album’s narrative as
Cole addresses a female love
interest and discusses sex,
