T
he start of the
summer saw
planning and
preparations for the
upcoming academic
year get underway
at ICSM Netball. With an
ever-expanding club, we
decided to shift some focus to
the development of the club
off-court whilst maintaining
team progression on-court.
One particular area of focus
was club engagement within
the community with the aim
being to use match-free days
to organise volunteering
opportunities for our
members.
We started early, gathering
a group of existing members
to volunteer at The Colour
Run in Wembley at the begin-
ning of September. Next up
was targeting newcomers and
remaining members of the
club. With our next match-
free day being the 23rd
of
November and following the
success of last year’s rede-
signed RAG Circle Line event,
we decided to collaborate
with this year’s ICSM RAG
Chair, Syra Dhillon. Together,
we organised for a group
of 15 netball girls to spend
an afternoon crafting for
Imperial College Healthcare
Charity’s annual Wishing Tree
Stall at St Mary’s Hospital in
Paddington.
Imperial College Healthcare
Charity is an independent
charity raising vital funds
for research and projects
that help improve patient
healthcare at the five London
hospitals of Imperial College
Healthcare Trust. The Wishing
Tree Appeal is one of many
projects run by the charity
throughout the year. This
year, the wishing tree appeal
is supporting young children
with long term illnesses and
life-changing conditions.
Money raised from the stall
will be used to support vital
outreach programmes such
as ‘Looking Forward Days’
which allow young patients
to meet, share experiences
and talk to other children
and teenagers with similar

conditions. Funds raised
will also allow the charity
to support families in crisis
with financial relief for travel
and accommodation, thus
allowing families to stay
together whilst their child
is in hospital and hopefully
alleviating some worry at
testing times.
We would like to extend
our thanks to Lauren Levy and
the team at Imperial College
Healthcare Charity for their
warm welcome and allowing
us to contribute to their good
cause! A special thank you
to Syra Dhillon for helping to
organise the afternoon. We
had a fantastic time rediscov-
ering our crafty sides and
spreading some festive cheer!
