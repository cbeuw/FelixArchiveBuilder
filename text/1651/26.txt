The fight to use LSD for research purposes
T
here is evidence
that certain
psychedelic drugs
can ‘reset’ irregular
functioning
of the brain if
administered in a safe and
controlled method, thus
leading to ground-breaking
revelations in medicine. This is
perhaps contrary to what you
may believe if you have been
reading this column for the
past few weeks.
Some may have the
ingrained belief that magic
mushrooms and LSD release
uncontrolled demons from
within, viciously addicting
users in minutes. If this is
you, then the idea that these
banned substances could cure
disorders of the brain should
be fascinating.

Dr Robin Carhart-Harris at
Imperial College London

psychedelic drugs. They

millions of people, especially
those who have failed to
respond to conventional
treatment.
In the 50s and 60s it was
almost impossible to open a
psychiatric journal without
coming across some form of
research into the effects of
LSD. At the time, LSD was the
newest wonder substance,
with the potential to treat any
mental ailment thrown at it.
However, by the late 60s, the
political will of worldwide
governments (particularly
the United States) stepped
up their anti-psychedelic
stance. With LSD increasingly
linked to the anti-Vietnam
war protests and counter-cul-
tural revolution, it received
an almost universal ban in
Western countries. With the
ban came an unprecedented
lull in research, with some
experts claiming the study of
psychedelic drugs in medicine
to have been set back by over
50 years.
Today, governments are
still not open to the idea of
increasing the availability
of psychoactive substances,
even for research. Famously,
Professor David Nutt was
sacked as chair of the UK
government’s Advisory Coun-
cil on the Misuse of Drugs
in 2009 by the then Labour
administration of Gordon
Brown. To be clear, he was
dismissed for claiming that
horse-riding was more dan-
gerous than ecstasy. Professor
Nutt wrote that horse-riding
caused ten deaths and more
than 100 road accidents each
year. Additionally, through
hunting, horse-riding also
led to “gatherings of users
that often are associated
with these groups engaging
in violent conduct”. He also
described other risky activi-
ties such as “base jumping,
climbing, bungee jumping,
hang-gliding, motorcycling”
which were much worse
than “many illicit drugs”. The
because they are called
‘drugs’. Other parts of life fre-
quently carry similar danger
yet people appear unaware.
In order to use a substance
such as LSD in research,
UK researches require a
£3,000 license from the
Home Office, in addition to
what I have heard described
as “years of paperwork”.
Furthermore they must source
a legal supply of the drug
in question. This is compli-
cated; you can imagine the
difficulty in trying to legally
source an illegal drug. It is
almost as if the government
is actively trying to suppress
research. LSD is classified as
something called a ‘Schedule
1’ substance, which means
the drug is extremely hard

point of these quotes was to
compare the risks between
horse-riding and ecstasy. It
was necessary to create a
debate about drug abuse
and risk taking. Often people
unfairly assign risk to drugs

this classification is reformed
it appears that psychoactive
substances such as LSD will
never be able to achieve the
great potential which was
foreseen for them in the 50s
and 60s.
Psychedelic drugs may yet
hold the key to untapped
medical potential that we are
unable to reach with conven-
tional treatments. However,
with the current stance of
governments worldwide, we
are unable to acquire these
substances, let alone research
them. Hopefully, with increas-
ing demand from academics,
we will able to undertake
research into what could be

ing medicinal care.

also means that the drug is

supposed to be conducted
within this ridiculous system?
If we are unable to perform
research then of course there
