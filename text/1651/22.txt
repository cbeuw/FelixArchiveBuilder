Culture editors Indira Mallik and
Fred Fyles give their round-up of
the last 12 months in terms of cu-
lutre. Expect TV escapism, high-
lighting women in music, and
going crazy over Olivia Laing...
D
uring the
American
election cycle
on his comedy
show Last Week
Tonight, John
Oliver had a running gag
– “look up,” he’d say “that
faint glimmer in the distance?
That’s rock bottom.” So it has
seemed for most of 2016;
in almost every sphere,
particularly in politics, bad
news has been followed by
worse news. Brexit in the
summer has been followed
by the election of a man
who brags about sexual
assault and, having promised
to “drain the swamp” of
and Prince earlier in the year,
has provided much needed
relief; some have been in
the form of escapism, others
as rousing calls to arms.
Beyonce released Lemonade
in February, an album that is
as much rooted in cinematog-
raphy as in music - if you ever
need a pick-me-up just watch
clips of Bey smashing cars
wearing a glorious Cavalli
yellow dress in Hold Up, or
Serena Williams telling every
man "boy, bye" in Sorry.
Lemonade was Beyonce's
most political offering to date,
celebrating the resilience of
black women in the face of
generations of hardship and
compromise. Its message of
healing and self-love had
much in common with Lizzo's
sophomore offering Coconut
Oil, in which Lizzo belts out
some impressive vocals to a
background of rich basses
and organs. Her lyrics on the
titular track are comforting
and empowering in a time
when we could all do with
just that; “I thought I needed
to run and find somebody
to love, but all I needed was
some coconut oil”. The album
of the year for me however
belongs to another Knowles
sister; Solange’s A Seat at the
Table is a haunting look at the
experience of black women
in America, it is by turns
lyrical, bleak and wonderfully
uplifting.
By mid-November all my
appetite for consuming
bittersweet media had been
used up; there was too much
in the real world to feel sad
about. It was at this moment
that I discovered Black
Mirror’s new season, in par-
ticular the fourth episode San
Junipero. Black Mirror is a
series known for its darkness.
San Junipero, the story of
two women time-travelling
and falling in love could
easily have conformed to
the pattern; their sapphic
relationship alone marked
them out for a target of a
potentially heartbreaking
resolution: 2016 was a year
in which the ‘bury your gays’
trope prevailed in TV. In
Orange Is the New Black,
Poussey Washington – a fan
favourite – was inadvertently
strangled by a guard after the
possibility of her release from
prison and a happy future
with her girlfriend seemed
within reach; in March, Lexa’s
demise on the cult hit The 100
caused an internet outcry that
lesbians and bisexual women
were being used as cannon
fodder to generate cheap
shock. Given Charlie Brook-
er’s propensity to write tragic
twist endings, we might’ve
expected the largely joyous
episode to end in a break-up,
yet San Junipero killed off
both characters and allowed
them to ride off Thelma
and Louise style (minus the
cliff edge) into the sunset.
The subversion of the ‘bury
your gays’ trope, as well
as a excellent 80s inspired
soundtrack (available on
Spotify) made San Junipero
unique not only in Brooker’s
oeuvre but in TV as a whole.
Subversion of Shakespeare
was at the core of Phyllida
Lloyd’s return to the Donmar.
The Shakespeare Trilogy fea-
tured an all-female cast in The
Tempest, Henry IV, and Julius
Caesar. The performances,
led by a diverse cast that
seemed to have benefited
from colour-blind casting, as
well as featuring women in
the male roles, brought fresh
insight into the 400-year-old
plays.
London staged several high
profile exhibitions this year
from Abstract Expression-
ism at the Royal Academy
to Picasso Portraits at the
National Portrait Gallery. My
favourite remains Painting the
Modern Garden at the Royal
Academy. It was filled with
beautiful works by Sargent,
Van Gogh, Matisse, by way
of Klee and Kandinsky, but
the stand out experience of
the exhibition was the last
room – huge Monet can-
vases were hung so that if one
stood in the right spot their
entire field of vision would be
filled with Monet’s visions of
his garden at Giverny.
2016 marked the return
of book reviews to the Arts
section, and my discovery of
the wondrous joy of reading
anything by Olivia Laing. In
The Lonely City, Laing mixes
criticism of the artists Edward
Hopper, Andy Warhol,
Henry Drager, and David
Wojnarowicz with her own
experiences of living an
increasingly lonely life in New
York; desperate for connec-
tion and yet unable to find it.
Her chapters on Wojnarow-
icz, in which she describes
the spread of the AIDS crisis
in New York, are particularly
moving. The experience of
reading Laing is enjoyable
not only for the topics she
tackles with extraordinary
sensitivity and insight but
the prose itself. Whilst I
was reading, I found myself
taking breaks to photograph
particular turns of phrase,
and in some instances entire
paragraphs to send to my
friends; the messages would
often be followed by my

first time I went to see it I was
mostly exercising my personal
form of protest against the
Reddit and 4chan users who
had spent the months preced-
ing its release rubbishing it
whenever possible, but the
next two times I went were to
enjoy the pure cheesy fun. It
may not have been critically
acclaimed but it was a movie
in which the female cast got
to save the world and did not
have to look cute whilst doing
it, that itself being worthy of
celebration.

tarting with the
death of David
Bowie, and
finishing with a
deeply shocking
humanitarian crisis
in Syria, 2016 has officially
been A Very Bad Thing.
Along the way, we’ve seen
the rise of far-right populism,
the election of a bully to the
highest political office, and
the death of numerous icons.
Is it any surprise that in this
terrible year, people want
to escape back into simpler
pleasures of the past? This
might explain the success of
Stranger Things – scripted
and directed by the Duffer
Brothers, Stranger Things
mined our collective nostalgia
for the 1980s (even among
those not born yet), layering
references to films like ET, The
Goonies, and Firestarter over
a brilliantly pulsing electronic
soundtrack. Featuring a
shady government research
facility, a small town hiding
dark secrets, and queen of
the universe Barb, Stranger
Things was an 8-hour escape
from the horrible going-ons in
the world.
While my two favourite
books of the year might be
wildly different in tone, they
share a common landscape.
In the non-fiction corner is The
Lonely City (Verso), by Olivia
Laing, a deeply moving
portrait of the New York arts
scene throughout the 20th
cen-
tury; Laing weaves her own
personal narrative through
the stories of luminaries
like Andy Warhol, Edward
Hopper, and Joseph Cornell,
all told through her brilliantly
lucid writing style. The chap-
ter on David Wojnarowicz,
an artist-cum-activist who died
of AIDS in 1992, is hauntingly
moving – Laing balances
extreme melancholy at fallout
from the AIDS crisis with a
righteous anger at those who
allowed it to continue. In the
fiction corner, meanwhile, is
Clare-Louise Bennett’s Pond
(Fitzcaraldo), a collection of
interconnected short stories
revolving around a woman
living alone on the coast of
an unknown town. Bennett’s
first collection, it displays her
mastery of language, which
she uses to craft a series
of strange, beguiling tales,
centring on the narrator’s
rich interior life; from broken
cookers to coveted ottomans,
the line between the physical
and the psychological is
blurred by Bennett in an
unnerving way. Both Pond
and The Lonely City speak
to the virtues of solitude
and quiet thought, but also
remind us that there is a fine
line between looking inwards
and becoming isolated. Most
importantly, they both remind
us that being alone and being
lonely are quite different
things.
Those interested in my
favourite films of the year can
flick over to the Film section
for a complete breakdown
of my top ten, but for me the
most underrated film of the
year was Lucile Hadžihal-
ilović’s Evolution, an unsettling
work of body horror whose
imagery burned itself onto
my retinas long after I left the
cinema. Centring around an
all-white village on a black
sand coast, whose sole inhab-
itants are young boys and
pale nurses, Evolution plays
out like the most horrific com-
bination of Michael Haneke
and David Cronenberg
you could imaging. Utterly
chilling.
While white women may
have turned on their brown
and black sisters in the US
election, choosing a man
who boasts of “grabbing
women by the pussy” over
the first female candidate for
a major party, in music, 2016
has definitively belonged
to women. Angel Olsen’s
My Woman was a fierce
statement of intent, different
enough from her breakout
2014 album Burn Your Fire
For No Witness for it to be
exciting, but retaining its
subtle force. Mistki, mean-
while, finally broke through
with Puberty 2, after three
previous excellent albums;
singing about themes ranging
from heartache to trying to fit
in as an East Asian woman in
modern America, Puberty 2
highlights Mitski’s clever lyrics
and deft shredding. "Your
mother wouldn’t approve of
how my mother raised me,"
she sings on My Best Amer-
ican Girl, "but I do, I finally
do" – you can almost imagine
her steady gaze as she sings
these lyrics. For me, the
best album of the year was
Solange’s A Seat at the Table,
which takes stock of what it
means to be black in America
today, with Solange daring
to display her heart and
anger on her sleeve. The most
exciting discovery, mean-
while, was Kadjha Bonet, an
LA-based multi-instrumentalist
whose debut EP The Visitor
mines funk, soul, R&B, and so
much more, to create a beau-
tiful, cohesive whole.
In terms of theatre, I haven’t
explored much outside that
which has been on at the
National Theatre, given
their brilliant £5 tickets for
under-26s; that being said, I
thought that their production
of The Threepenny Opera
was phenomenal, bringing
all the sharp-edged wit and
dark humour we would
expect from a Brecht piece.
Rory Kinear was excellent
as Macheath, but it was the
supporting cast that stole the
show, particularly Sharon
Small’s tragic Jenny Diver
and Nick Holder’s terrifying
cross-dressing Mr Peachum.
In the art world, 2016
has been a year of firsts:
the RA did their first major
retrospective of the abstract
expressionists since the
1950s; Tate Modern did their
first Robert Rauschenberg
retrospective since the artist’s
death; and the Whitechapel
Gallery ran the first exhibition
centring on electronic art.
My favourite exhibition was
the Tate Modern’s Georgia
O’Keeffe retrospective, which
showed her as a giant of
American modernism, whose
work far extends past the
flower paintings for which
she is best known. From the
strange landscapes of New
Mexico, to the celebratory
paintings of New York,
O’Keeffe’s work presents the
familiar in strange and unex-
pected ways – the exhibition,
which displayed many works
never seen outside the USA,
was a complete triumph.
