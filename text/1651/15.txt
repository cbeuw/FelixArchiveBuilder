T
he Winton Gallery
is all about shape.
It explores how
mathematics shape
every aspect of our
lives The stunning
new permanent gallery
space, unveiled last week at
the Science Museum, was
designed by Zaha Hadid
and her team. Its main aim is
unravelling the fundamental
role mathematicians have
played in the development of
civilization.
The Winton offers a swoop-
ing, long arching perspective
on mathematics, a view of
the field rather like the view
you might get from the 1929
Handley Page biplane that
hangs suspended from the
ceiling. The hard graft and
dry technicalities have been
glossed over – it’s the vistas
that are on display here.
From salesmen to sailors,
from aircraft engineers to
bankers, and from gamblers
to garden designers, this gal-
lery is a flight over 400 years
of human ingenuity. Taking
off in the Renaissance and
landing to the present day,
over 100 incredible objects
including intriguing hand-held
mathematical instruments and
a 1929 experimental aircraft
are presented and explained.
Their display is thematically
arranged around Trade/
Travel, War/Peace, Maps/
Models, Life/Death, Form/
Beauty. The fil rouge that links
all those objects is of course
maths, which is presented
not as an obscure activity
undertaken by a niche of
bad that the whole experi-
ence is slightly undermined
by the very high glass display
cases that block the hypnotic
view of the central curvy
structure and by the noise
coming from the interactive
displays in the Energy Gallery
nearby.
Some of the exhibits in the
Winton are real hits: a Heath
Robinson-looking Moniac
machine, William Froude's
Swan and Raven hulls, Turner
sketches, and PDP-8 minicom-
puter to name a few. Curated
by David Rooney, the exhibits
tell stories rather than dictate
mathematical principles.
To attempt to humanise the
abstract is a good choice:
the Winton brings a subject
thought to be dry and boring
down from the ivory tower,
to a place more accessible to
the masses.
The Winton Gallery is the
first of Hadid’s projects to
open in the UK since her
death in March 2016. Zaha
Hadid and her team of archi-
tects have been exploring
and connecting the fields of
Theunbearablelightnessofmaths
Agnese Abrusci
researchers working in back-
rooms, but as an essential
tool in understanding in our
everyday life.
Maths permeated Dame
Zaha Hadid's life; she was
a maths graduate before
studying architecture. Her
design touchstone of the
airflow around the aircraft
wings sculpts the dynamics of
the gallery's central space.
The design was driven by the
equations of airflow used in
the aviation industry, which
is still an important area of
mathematical research.
When walking into the
Maths gallery you immerse
yourself into a serene pur-
ple-lighted fluid space. All
becomes vector flow fields
which create a contempla-
tive aesthetic. The curved
overhead structure and layout
of the gallery represents the
airflow around the Handley
Page aircraft suspended
at its centre. The hypnotic
turbulence field leads your
way to the different section of
the galleries where incredible
objects are on display. Too
urbanism, architecture, and
design since 1979. Working
with office partner Patrik
Schumacher for almost three
decades, Hadid's vision rede-
fined the architecture of the
21st
century. She dedicated
herself to worldwide projects
that combined the unwaver-
ing belief in the power of
invention with the connectivity
and fluidity of the surround-
ing space. From the Olympic
Aquatics Centre to the cafete-
ria of the Serpentine Gallery,
from Beijing to Baku, Zaha
Hadid's unique buildings
are everywhere. Now there
is one of her creations just
around the corner – so go
and explore!

Installation by Zaha Hadid Architects (detail) \\ Agnese Abrusci
P
icture a piece
of contemporary
architecture. You’re
probably thinking
of the work of Frank
Gehry – his works
are considered by many in
the world of architecture to
be defining buildings of the
20th
and 21st
century. Gehry
buildings, the Guggenheim in
Bilbao being one, are fiercely
modernist; great structures
of steel and chrome tacked
together that rise defiantly
from the ground. His is a
style that is common amongst
his male contemporaries.
These are loud buildings. By
contrast Dame Zaha Hadid’s
work is subtle, quieter –
the buildings blossom, the
components flow into each
other. Gehry’s work is often
a mere facade – once inside
there is often not much of
interest. Hadid’s creations
have an understated drama
that only grows once you’re
inside. Light predominates
in the interiors of Hadid’s
designs, both from halogen
lights and natural light
introduced in unexpected
ways – an almost womb-like
experience is created, quite
unlike being inside any other
modernist building.
Hadid, who was born in
Baghdad in 1950, studied
mathematics at the American
University of Beirut, and then
went to study architecture at
the Architectural Association
School in London. Her herit-
age alone marks her out as
exceptional amongst her con-
temporaries: google ‘famous
architects’, and Hadid is the
only non-male, non-white
face that will come up. Her
birthplace was, however, the
least remarkable fact about
her; her personality was just
as larger-than-life as her
buildings. There are countless
anecdotes about her that
paint a picture of her as a
real life Miranda Priestley, the
terrifying head of a fashion
magazine in The Devil Wears
Prada – during her studies,
when asked for a design at
a briefing, Hadid threw her
scarf on the table with a
flourish and said “here’s your
design” and stalked out; in
another instance, during the
Venice Biennale, when she
realised she had forgotten
to pack her favourite pair of
heels, she sent her assistant to
her flat in London to retrieve
them in time for a party the
same night.
From the outrageous stories
it might be easy to brush
her off as merely a drama
queen, more concerned
with theatrics than with the
hard graft of architecture.
Her professional accolades
discredit this – she is the only
woman to have won the Royal
Institute of British Architects’
Gold Medal in her own right.
Technical skills gathered
from her mathematics degree
underpin her designs – she
referenced fluid dynamics,
was inspired by the organic
curves present in nature:
shells and waves, lilies. As her
career progressed her designs
matured in ambition; other
architects may have balked at
her impossible designs but her
background in mathematics
made sure that she under-
stood how materials would
meld together to create a
cohesive whole.
Her buildings with their
undulating curves can be
seen all over the world. She
designed the Aquatics Centre
for the Olympic Games in
2012. Wave-like (it also looks
a bit like a tongue too), it’s
a concrete structure that
is impossibly streamlined,
impossibly light looking –
others may have taken the
industrial, solid material
and created something that
hunkers down into the earth,
stolid in its solidness; instead
Hadid’s design seems to be
on the verge of taking flight.
Another of her designs,
the ROCA Gallery in West
Brompton is pleasingly sci-fi:
white interiors are peppered
with curved, sculpted pillars
that seems like the inside of
an alien spaceship. Some
buildings that attempt to be
futuristic quickly seem to
become dated. The ROCA
Gallery, built more than 5
years ago, still feels aspi-
rational, filled with smooth
concrete and white chrome.
Hadid unexpectedly passed
away earlier this year after a
sudden heart attack in hospi-
tal following an admission for
bronchitis. Her death is a loss
to the world of architecture
which finds itself without her
original voice. The first of her
designs to be unveiled after
her death is the ceiling of the
Winton Gallery in the Science
Museum. The curves swoop in
and out like petals of a flower
unfurling – it’s lit up with
pink and purple lights. The
technicolour aspect is unusual
for Hadid who normally
bathes her interiors in natural
light or monochrome. Her
sketches are on display at
the Serpentine Gallery, and
the ROCA Gallery and the
Aquatic Centre are available
to visit. Within the next few
years, her design for the
Al Wakrah Stadium for the
Qatar 2022 World Cup will
be realised – this is a building
that has been dogged with
controversy. By June 2015
upwards of 1200 workers had
died in Qatar due to poor
working conditions, the death
toll is predicted to rise into
over 7000 by the time the
preparations are completed.
Hadid distanced herself from
the deaths saying that she
had only been involved in the
design process, and had no
power to change the situa-
tion, saying "I have nothing to
do with the workers...I think
that's an issue the govern-
ment – if there's a problem
– should pick up. Hopefully,
these things will be resolved."
Hadid carved out a niche
for herself at the top of the
world of architecture. She
refused to be influenced, or
cowed by her contemporaries
and thus blazed a path for
women in the field which even
now is dominated largely by
old white men. Her buildings
remain as her legacy – one
of uncompromising originality
and fierce individuality.
