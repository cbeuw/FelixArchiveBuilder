Crowning
Glory | The
Crown
Saad Ahmed
The Crown takes a rare look at
the formative years of Queen
Elizabeth, and chronicles
the royal family’s escapades
through the 20th century.
Does it stack up well? Or is is
just aimless royalty-porn?
T
he Crown isn’t
just one of the
most anticipated
shows of the year,
but if the rumors
of its budget of
£100 million an episode
are true, it’s also one of
the most expensive. This
is Netflix’s attempt at
trying out something more
traditional yet different (at
least by Netflix standards)
at the same time, aiming to
reach for a different kind of
demographic. After watching
the show, one conclusion
you immediately draw is that
Peter Morgan’s take on young
Queen Elizabeth is a superb
triumph for Netflix.
The show revolves around
Queen Elizabeth accepting
her destiny and stepping
up to lead the country. It’s
interesting to see her stripping
more and more of her indi-
viduality for the sake of the
country as time goes on. From
simply choosing a personal
secretary to responding to
her sister’s request to marry
someone not approved by
the Church. It’s an intriguing
position to be in and one
that’s engaging to watch. At
one point, Churchill sums it up
with the quote “No one wants
you to be you. They want you
to be it.”
We see all the major play-
ers of the time, the different
events as they play out and
how everything flows and
connects together. The crown,
in a compassionate piece of
work, gives a brilliant depic-
tion of the Royal Family and
humanises them in a way that
has never been seen before.
It is a portrait of an extraor-
dinary family, an intelligent
commentary on the effects of
the constitution on their per-
sonal lives, and a fascinating
account of postwar Britain all
rolled into one.
The performances are all
excellent. Claire Foy is great
as the young Elizabeth, giving
a portrayal of someone who’s
soft-spoken but tough. Just by
looking at her face, you can
see that her pretty and play-
ful smile hides the weight of
the world borne on her shoul-
ders. Former Doctor Who
star Matt Smith also gives a
stellar performance as Prince
Phillip, a man of ambition
and gnawing insecurity, traits
which keep him from coming
across as a know-it-all. The
two share a touching and
easy chemistry that makes the
longevity of the union easy to
understand, and renders the
couple not just sympathetic
but human.
Going through all the cast
members would take too long
but suffice to say, everyone
is giving it their all and gives
layered and nuanced per-
formances. Jared Harris as
King George is a particular
standout, giving an even
more impressive performance
than Colin Firth did in the
King’s Speech. He is a doting
father but a tough monarch,
not afraid to make the hard
decisions that needs to be
made.
The Crown is one of Netf-
lix’s most expensive shows for
a reason; the money is there
on the screen, as it needs to
be to truly capture the wealth
and scope of the monarchy.
You can hear the ticks of the
grandfather clocks, and
even the shift of
weight in
every
piece
of

niture as characters are
granted an audience with
their queen. Everything
looks brilliant and is simply
stunning, from very public
moments like the coronation
to more private ones like
Philip taking flying lessons
over the British countryside.
Many people seem to want
and crave for power. While
that may not necessarily
be a bad thing, this show
ultimately makes a strong
and riveting argument for
the ways in which the cost
of the throne isn’t worth its
benefits. The Queen Mother
talks about how her husband
was really two different
people, before and after he
took the throne. And when
it’s Elizabeth’s turn to take her
father’s place, Queen Mary
writes her a letter warning of
a similar dichotomy between
Elizabeth Windsor and
Queen Elizabeth.
The history of the Royal
family in the 20th
century is,
of course, well documented
but Morgan keeps the story
interesting even in episodes
without big historical events.
The coronation and Eliza-
beth’s 1953 world tour make
for rich hours, but Morgan
is as confident building an
episode around Elizabeth
studding a prize horse or
the Queen Mum’s trip to
Scotland. The first season
is definitely worth watching
and incredibly binge worthy;
though of course, it only
makes the wait for
season two even
longer.
Don’t you hate it when you really like a hat but they
only have it one size too large? \\ Netflix
