Transphobic incident in Reynolds Bar
Attempt was made to eject trans student from the toilets
Lef Apostolakis
experiences in the Reynolds
toilets compared to the Union
or any other at Imperial.”
Allegedly, one of the students
involved in the incident later
lodged a complaint with the
Reynolds Bar management.
We have reached out to the
management for comment.
A
transphobic
i n c i d e n t
r e p o r t e d l y
took place
last week at
the women’s
restroom of the Reynolds Bar
at Charing Cross Hospital,
against a member of women’s
rugby.
The trans student involved
was grabbed by the arms in an
attempt to forcefully eject them
from the women’s restroom.
Thankfully one of the student’s
team players was there to
explain and help pacify the
situation before there was a
chance for escalation.
“We both went to the
women’s bathroom. When we
entered there were several
girls there already, one girl
turned around and starting
yelling “Boy in the bathroom”,
and grabbed [me] by the arm
and starting dragging me
out the bathroom. My friend
backed me, going “No, no,
they’re not a boy: they’re non-
binary”.
“Theythengotveryawkward
and I was ushered towards the
next free cubicle. My friend
initiated a conversation with
them, where the girl initially
refused to apologise, with a
line of thought “How was I
supposed to know”. I quickly
left the bathroom, and said
“It was fine, it happens all
the time”, I just didn’t want to
make a big deal about it, or let
it ruin the night.”
Such experiences are not
rare amongst Imperial’s
trans population. Most trans
students are uncomfortable
in gendered toilets and
will usually try and find
one that is gender neutral,
especially during big socials,
when people tend to drink
and are more likely to act
inappropriately.
While Imperial has made
some progress, introducing
several gender neutral toilets
in the last couple of years,
there is still a lot of work to be
done. The Union bar gender-
neutral toilet, for example, is
almost always in use, as is the
Metric gender-neutral toilet,
due to it being the nearest one
to the dancefloor. This means
that, despite such facilities
existing, trans students don’t
necessarily have easy access
to a gender neutral option.
“I often have problems in
bathrooms, but this was the
first time it was physical, and
had I been alone or in an
unfamiliar environment, or
had I not been significantly
larger than the girl, it would
have been a lot more of a
upsetting experience. Some
of my friends following this
continued to argue with the
girl about her actions and
many of my friends at rugby
kept on checking I was okay. I
have had far more transphobic
Imperial wins Animal Testing award
This is despite past criticism Abigail de Bruin
concerned, there has not been
a significant decrease in the
number of animals involved in
research between 2015 and
2103/14, however, there has
been a decrease from 8% to
6% from 2015 to 2014 in the
proportion of experiments
producing a “severe” effect
on the animal involved. So, is
the College actually better at
treating the animals used for
research properly? There’s an
argument that we were never
really that bad. One’s thing
for certain, we’re definitely
better at talking about it.

mperial has had a pretty
rocky history with Animal
Research within the
College and its public
image. From the low point
of the 2014 Home Office
statement that there was a
“widespread poor culture of
care”, such clear progress
has been made that College
have now been awarded for
their work towards Animal
Welfare. Imperial College
has been presented with a
Highly Commended award
in the category of Public
Engagement Activity at the
annual awards for Openness
the Freedom of Information
Act showed that Imperial was
failing to provide 24-hour care
for animals. This was disputed
by the College with an Imperial
spokeswoman stating that
outside normal working hours,
there was “always at least one
vet and five senior animal care
staff on call” to attend to any
emergencies. She continued,
“The college complies with
the Home Office’s regulations
concerning out-of-hours care,
and works closely with the
Home Office as regulator,”.
As far as the actual levels of
animal research at College are

past the CFI (Cruelty Free
International) investigation
in 2013 that alleged
“appalling animal suffering
on a very large scale” on
the Hammersmith campus,
even with only five of the
180 charges from the report
substantiated by the Home
Office. The organisation
CFI has relatively recently
challenged the College’s
provision of 24-hour care for
animals.
As new statistics on the use
of animals in experiments were
released in March, said that

Mandy Thorpe, Director of
Central Biomedical Services,
who accepted the award on
behalf of Imperial, said: “It
was fantastic to be recognised
for our ongoing work in being
more open about our research
involving animals. At Imperial
we are committed to sharing
the results of our research,
and when that has involved
animal studies, we strive to
explain how and why animals
were involved.

I’ll be honest, it doesn’t really
get much better here either.
Two sets of bombings in both
Brussels and Lahore together
killed over 100 people and
devastated both the cities
as well as the wider world.
Elsewhere, in a bizarre show
of love, an Egyptian man
hijacked EgyptAir flight 181 in
order to try and win his ex-wife
back– the plane landed safely,
thankfully. Probably should’ve
just gone with the flowers and
chocolates route in hindsight.
Notable deaths included the
footballing legend Johan
Cruyff and former First Lady
Nancy Reagan. (Here is where
some uplifting news would be,
had we any).
Some small bits of solace
could be found in April, unless
you’re anti monarchy that is.
Queen Elizabeth II turned 90
and held a pretty big party,
christ knows how bad her hang-
over was the following day.
In other news, surprise, sur-
prise, some rich people don’t
like paying taxes and instead
funnelled it through Mossak
Fonseca in Panama. High
ranking officials and politicians
worldwide were affected, even

eron, who profited from a trust
This month contained one
of the feelgood stories of
the year, Leicester City’s Pre-
mier League title win. Yes I’m
clutching at straws but I can
only work with what I’ve got,
and everyone loves a good
underdog story anyway. Back
to politics, and to the London
Mayoral election. Sadiq
Khan beat Zac Goldsmith to
the position (Zac would later
go on to lose a second elec-
tion in December, poor him)
which meant that Boris Bikes
legally became Sadiq Cycles.
EgyptAir carried on having a
horrible year, with flight 804
crashing and killing 66 passen-
gers. One small silver lining is
that 2016 is still due to be one
of the safest years for flying
on record. In meme news, this
was the month that yielded the
tragic and untimely death of
Harambe. People worldwide
were in uproar at his death
and it all eventually got a bit
out of hand (understatement of
the year).
June decided it wanted to
take British politics and shake
it up (read: fuck it up). This
came in the form of the eagerly
anticipated EU Referendum,
whose fallout hit pretty much
all the main political parties
in Westminster. Unless you’ve
managed to repress it from
memory you’ll know that Brexit
happened and then caused
chaos. Long story short, David
had avoided tax that way.
Naughty Dave. Prince also left
us in April, he probably could
foresee what was coming. I
wouldn’t put it past him.
