Ruth Wilson
breathes new
life into Hedda
Gabler
U
npredic t able,
b e a u t i f u l ,
haughty, callous
– Hedda Gabler
is one of Ibsen’s
b e s t - k n o w n
anti-heroines. Trapped in
a life devoid of meaning,
she desires freedom and
power, but is unable to seize
it for herself. She is stifled
and unfulfilled; the people
around her bore her, from
her insipid husband Tesman
to his well-meaning aunts. It
is her frustrated longing, her
violent individuality, that turns
destructive when caged. She
deliberately pushes her ex-
lover Lovborg back over the
edge into alcoholism, burns the
only copy of his manuscript,
and encourages him to seek
a “beautiful” death in suicide.
Where does all this take
her? Nowhere, it seems.
Instead of the “deed of
deliberate courage” she
sought, Lovborg dies a vulgar
death in the bedchambers of
a prostitute. Hedda herself,
despite her thirst for freedom,
is placed by incriminating evi-
dence at the mercy of Judge
Brack. Even her despised
husband Tesman deserts
her. Backed into a corner, a
disillusioned Hedda attempts
one last act of beauty; taking
her father’s gun, she shoots
herself through the temple.
This production at the
National Theatre is a con-
temporary Hedda Gabler by
Dutch director Ivo van Hove,
known for his avant-garde
theatrical productions. Even
the script gets an overhaul,
with a new version of Ibsen’s
original written by Patrick
Marber. Marber’s script
removes some of Ibsen’s orig-
inal subtlety – his Hedda is
more caustic, his Brack more
aggressive. This is a change,
but not a bad one; it shines
a starker light on Hedda’s
foibles and struggles, both
internal and external. The
modern setting, for once,
was not out of place at all.
Perhaps because Hedda – a
large personality confined
in too small a space – is not
a character who belongs
only to a single specific time
period. If anything, ennui and
existential crises are more
relevant today than they were
in the 19th
century.
The set, designed by Jan
Versweyveld, has a minimalist
feel. Sparsely scattered
furniture points to Tesman’s
inability to furnish the
lavish lodgings that Hedda
demands. Their house is
dominated by Hedda’s piano
in centre stage, and a modern
Claire Chan
video-intercom system that
buzzes shrilly every time
someone enters the Tesmans’
house. Characters enter and
leave through the actual
doors to the theatre rather
than slipping off into the
wings. All except Hedda,
the only character for whom
there is no exit.
Ruth Wilson embodies
Hedda perfectly, capturing
her melancholy, aspirations
and trenchant wit. From
Jane Eyre in the 2006 BBC
adaptation to Alison Lockhart
in The Affair, Wilson has
been celebrated for her sharp
portrayals of intelligent, com-
plex characters. Her Hedda
is nonchalantly caustic, with
a dangerous charisma that
barely hides roiling undercur-
rents of bitterness and misery.
As Brack, the unscrupu-
lous judge who harbours
designs on Hedda, Rafe Spall
deserves special mention.
He starts off as an almost
charming friend of the Tes-
mans, the only one (aside
from Lovborg) who seems to
understand Hedda’s inner
thoughts and desires. He runs
a hand casually up Hedda’s
leg; he playfully offers himself
for a ménage à trois. But his
actions become steadily more
menacing as the play goes
on. In the third act he pins
Hedda to a wall; she laughs
in his face because he has no

hold over her.
The final act, when Brack
does have Hedda in his
power, is frightening and
fraught with tension. Taking
a sip from a can of blood-like
liquid, he spits it in Hedda’s
face and pours it on her
dress, revelling in her inability
to resist. He throws her to
the floor and towers over
her apparently bloodstained
figure. It is a deeply disturb-
ing scene of violence. Van
Hove is not called a contro-
versial director for nothing; I
expect this move will divide
audiences, though for me it
seemed appropriate as the
last straw, the utter loss of
control that broke Hedda and
drove her to suicide.
The rest of the cast was
very good, though Chukwudi
Iwuji was rather too staid
and scholarly as Lovborg. I
could not imagine him, like
Dionysus, “with vine leaves
in his hair", the embodiment
of free-spirited courage that
Hedda saw him to be. Kyle
Soller was an unusually likea-
ble Tesman; I found it difficult
to despise him as Hedda did.
But perhaps that was the
point.
Some small details marred
the play a little for me; the
housekeeper Berte takes
on a strange importance
in van Hove’s production,
watching dispassionately
in every scene but abruptly
exulting with Hedda as she
burns Lovborg’s manuscript.
What she is meant to signify
remains a mystery to me.
Also, the audience has to sit
through Toni Mitchell’s Blue
four times, as an unnecessary
cue for Hedda’s melancholy
introspection. Wilson is more
than capable of portray-
ing this without blatant
signposting.
“People don’t do such
things!” exclaims Judge Brack
at Hedda’s dead body in the
play’s famous closing line.
Flying in the face of con-
vention, van Hove’s Hedda
Gabler is an fresh, compelling
and poignant breath of air for
Ibsen’s classic play.
T
he Crucible' at Guildhall was my favourite show of the year. In the wake of everything that has
happened in 2016 it’s quite difficult to be overly optimistic about the future but the Crucible
reminded me of how mad people were in the 1950’s, and we managed to get through that. Maybe
- like the ice ages which come and go over millions of years - collective hysteria frosts and thaws in
the modern world over decades. We’re in the middle of a snowstorm at the moment but soon the
MacArthurs of our age will lose their way, and the Gorbachevs will be waiting with samovar in
hand to guide us back into the sun. It’s a nice thought anyway.

A
nother knockout screenplay from the rising star that is Lucy Kirkwood, The Children
at the Royal Court Theatre was one of the capital's stand out theatre productions this
year. Three retired nuclear physicists, in the wake of the meltdown of the nuclear
plant they helped design and build, contemplate their role in the disaster from the
kitchen of a seaside cottage over the course of two days: the physical, emotional,
and moral implications that come with it – with a wonderful wit and truly laught-
out-loud dialogue. An absolute viewing delight for audience members of all ages (dare we say
modern masterpiece?), topped with an excellent set design. What's more it runs until the 17th
of
January - so make the short journey to Sloane Square and enjoy this phenomenal play while you
still can!
T
his has been my first year writing for Felix; my first foray into journalism. And what a
year it has been already! It’s very hard for me to pick a favourite from the amazing
events I’ve been to this term. But if pressed, I think I might choose Paul Nash’s exhibition
at the Tate Modern. Art is not something I am widely read in at all. Does that make
appreciating it harder, or easier? At the very least, I can approach a work with a
completely open and unbiased eye. Paul Nash’s works, with their strange air of
otherworldliness, their suggestions of monumental power, stirred something in me. There are few
human figures in his works, and those that exist are lost in the sheer vastness of his landscapes:
the infinite sky, an unending expanse of sea, his trees charged with symbolism. It is the idea of
the sublime that comes to the fore in his art. Beauty, terrible and overwhelming, that moves us to
awe as it “serenely disdains to annihilate us”.
