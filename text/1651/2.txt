I
t’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. The tube
is packed, the streets are clogged, shopping is a
nightmare and you keep embarrassing yourself,
blurting out family secrets at dinners, to people
you barely know.
Meanwhile, there are all these fake gifts
everywhere: stupid, empty, gift-wrapped boxes
designed to lure you in and get your hopes up when
you know that all you really deserve is a big ol’ lump
of coal.
Empty gift wrapped boxes – isn’t it great how
a seemingly harmless Christmas decoration can
act so well as an analogy for the human condition,
sending you tumbling into the abysmal depths of an
existential crisis? Beautiful and shiny on the outside,
sturdy-looking, deceptively full of promise even, but
dark, bare and empty on the inside. Ah the joys of the
holidays.
Speaking of shattered illusions, as you might have
picked up on if you read any of the national papers,
Imperial released a report that is the equivalent of
taking an axe and hacking into all your beautifully
gift-wrapped Christmas gifts and spilling out all their
contents for everyone to see during a formal dinner
at your parents house. During the American Psycho
inspired mental breakdown, you hack into some great
gifts, like that virtual reality headset you’ve been
waiting all year for. You also hack into some expected
presents such as socks, underwear and a pair of fuzzy
bunny slippers. But then you also hack into all those
empty gift-wrapped boxes, shattering the illusion of
opulence and excess and embarrassing your family,
though everyone already knew that half the gifts
under the tree were just for show.
This is our last issue of term, and it’s stupidly thick
again to keep you company over the winter break, or
at the very least to keep you warm if you live in Evelyn
Gardens and your heating fails you again.
Inside this super-spesh edition, you will find the best
and worst of 2016. You will laugh and you will cry but
predominantly you’ll probably just stare blankly at the
pages wondering what is wrong with the paper, your
life and the world in general.
So from everyone here at felix, happy holidays and
don’t forget to take a break. You’ve earned it. Unless
you’re a fresher, in which case you haven’t earned
nothin’ yet.
