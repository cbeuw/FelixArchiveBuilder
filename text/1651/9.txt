Sara Hamilton lists the top nine ground breaking discoveries in the field of nuclear physics and
material science in 2016
T
his week Physics
World has
announced the
winner of its yearly
Breakthrough of
the year: the Ligo
Scientific Collaboration,
involving more than 80
institutions worldwide, for “its
revolutionary, first-ever direct
observations of gravitational
waves”. This is the first
ever direct evidence of the
existence of black holes. Nine
other achievements are highly
commended, groundbreaking
discoveries from nuclear
physics to materials science:
1. A new illustration of the
Schrodinger’s cat para-
dox (Chen Wang, Robert
Schoelkopf and colleagues
at Yale University and INRIA
Paris-Rocquencourt). They
managed to exemplify
quantum superposition by
representing the cats by a
large ensemble of photons
and the two boxes by micro-
wave cavities.
2. New Gravimeter (Uni-
versity of Glasgow scientists)
which can make very precise
measurements of the Earth’s
gravity with potential applica-
tions in mineral exploration,
volcano monitoring, and civil
engineering.
3. Nearest Neighbour (Pale
Red Dot collaboration), a
rocky exoplanet within the
habitable zone of Proxima
Centauri and the nearest
star of the Solar system. It is
about 1.3 times the size of the
Earth and could theoretically
sustain liquid water on its
surface.
4. Quantum Entanglement
(Chris Balance at Universty
of Oxford and Ting Rei Tan
at University of Colorado
at Boulder), a phenomenon
between two different types
of ions that could make
new microscope lens offering
a revolutionary combination
of large field of view and high
resolution.
8. Fundamental particle
interaction simulations (Rainer
Blatt and Peter Zoller of the
Institute for Quantum Optics
and Information at the Univer-
sity of Innsbruck) on quantum
computers, a significant
quantum computers a reality.
5. Nuclear Clock (Lars von
der Wense, Peter Thirolf at
Ludwig Maximilian University
of Munich, Helmholtz Institute
Mainz, and the Johannes
Gutenberg University Mainz),
which could be developed
from the transition discovered
in the element thorium-229.
Such a clock would be con-
siderably more stable than
current atomic clocks.
6. Negative refraction (Cory
Dean, Avik Ghosh at Colum-
bia University, University of
Virginia, Cornell University,
the Japanese National Insti-
tute for Materials Science,
and Shenyang National Labo-
ratory for Materials science),
a property discovered in
graphene. This could lead to
the creation of revolutionary
powerful lenses.
7. Mesolens (Gail McCon-
nell, Brad Amos at the
University of Strathclyde), a

trolling through
the markets of the
city Myitkyina in
Myanmar, Lida
Xing, a scientist
with China
University of Geosciences,
Beijing, came across a
block of amber that had
preserved within it a fossil of
a dinosaur’s tail from nearly
99 million years ago.
A collaborative study by
palaeontologists from Royal
Saskatchewan Museum,
Canada, China University of
Geosciences, Beijing, and
University of Bristol, UK has
provided new insights on the
evolution of feather structure.
The work has recently been
published in the journal Cur-
rent Biology.
The fossil is that of a
dinosaur belonging to a car-
nivorous group, the theropods,
which probably lived some-
time during the mid-cretaceous
period. Observations suggest
the tail colour to be brown on
the top and paler in colour on
the underside, lined by feath-
ers all along its length. Unlike
in present day birds or their
ancestors, the vertebrae of this
fossilised tail are not fused
together, but are instead long
and very flexible with the keel,
the area where the flight mus-
cles are attached: a typical
characteristic of flying dino-
saurs. The feathers found on
this fossil differ from the ones
that we see on birds today.
The feathers of birds like
those of the pigeons that we
often spot strutting down the
pavements typically consist of
a long shaft called the rachis.
Attached to the rachis are
rows of fine filaments called
barbs which are intertwined
with one another by barbules,
forming a tightly woven
surface. The fossil specimen
exhibits a well developed
branching system of barbs
and barbules, however, it has
a poorly developed rachis.
This clearly indicates the
barbs and barbules to have
evolved much before the
rachis.
Well preserved fossils are
a rare find. They provide a
snapshot of how life existed
during the pre-historic times.
Amber or fossilised resin is
one of the best mediums for
fossil preservation. So well
preserved is this specimen,
that the scientists were able
to retrieve the soft tissues and
even haemoglobin from the
blood.
High-quality fossils such as
these help palaeontologists
to piece together the tale
of how our modern day
birds evolved from the flying
cold-blooded reptiles of the
pre-historic times. The scien-
tists of this study believe that
unlike some species of reptiles
found today, this particular
dinosaur couldn’t shed its tail
but succumbed to an untimely
death after getting it caught
in the glue-like resin.
A tale within a tail
Ipsita Herlekar reveals the secrets of a well preserved dinosaur fossil
development in the field.
9. Single-atom engine
(Kilian Singer, Johannes
Roßnagel at University of
Mainz), a heat engine based
on just one atom, able to
convert a difference in tem-
perature to mechanical work
using a single calcium ion.
