Let’s face it, 2016 has been an awful year. To be honest, this section
could easily just be ‘The News’. But, the shitiness of reality does not
excuse the shitiness of art. So, let’s examine some of the attrocities
commited in the name of ‘entertainment’ on the small screen this year.
The Worst of TV
MacGyver |
CBS
Because apparently some
people still haven’t been
completely burned by the idea
of rebooting 80s franchises,
here comes MacGyver. A
completely half-assed, badly
acted cash grab, this series
barely feigns an attempt at
emulating its ideal. There’s no
suspense, and the pacing is
bizzare. It all just makes you
ask, ‘who wanted this, who is
it for?’
Ok, I promise you, the
purpose of this article isn’t just
to shit on things from the 80s.
Really, though, the failure of
this sitcom revival should be a
surprise to no one. Televison
as a medium has evolved so
much since those days that
even the most innocuous
sitcoms today have more
depth, substance, and edge
than Full House. Attempting
to bring those elements into
Fuller House just leads to
culture clash, but leaving
them out makes it dated. It’s
lose-lose; this was a bad idea.
Oh Gary Sinise. Lieutenant Dan
should keep looking for legs
elsewhere, because this show
certainly doesn’t have any.
Spinning out of the mediocre at
best Criminal Minds, this show
flaunts the bizzare premise of
some sort of global police team
that saves Americans from those
bad foreigners who just want to
victimize them.
The one thing the show does
have going for it, however, is that
it’s probably the most critically
panned show of the year.
Appropriately for the subject
matter, the network title is
downright prophetic. It’s
what you’ll be needing after
watching this. Credit where
credit is due, rather than
attempting to reboot The Omen
movie franchise, this series acts
as some sort of continuation;
with an adult Damien coming
to grips with his role as the anti-
christ. However, the cliched
choice of aesthetics, coupled
with the laughable dialogue
and direction mean this show
is DOA.
Probably the least offensive entry on this list, Lucifer isn’t that
bad really. However, it’s a perfect example of the tragedy
of ‘what could have been’. A largely uninspired, if decent
cop show, Lucifer is based on the seminal DC comic of the
same name. We could have had a grand cosmic saga about
gods and angels, instead, we got CSI: Hell. And believe me,
that’s not nearly as interesting as it sounds.

But, let’s avoid ending on a sour note. Despite everything, 2016 has
been a remarkably good year for television. In fact, so much so that
narrowing this down to just five was quite the challenge. So, in case
you missed them, here are the highest highs of the year’s offerings.
The Best of TV

The typically sharp and
piercing animated Netflix show
continues to enthrall. This year,
we watched Bojack struggling
to deal with a resurgence in his
fame, as all his friends gradually
drift away.
This season graced us with
an absolutely beautiful silent
underwater episode; scored
only with ethereal pop music.
Equally,it unflinchingly delivered
perhaps the show’s most
emotionally draining punches in
its penultimate episode.

It really has been all-change
for Donald Golver this year;
whether it’s re-inventing his
rapper persona Childish
Gambino into a bonafide
funk god, or moving away
from straight comedy to
drama.
Atlanta puts a lens on an
American sub-culture that’s
only really ever explored
in stereotypes on TV. What
results is a heartfelt, and
fascinating series that
comfortably flits between
drama anbd comedy.

Westworld |
HBO
With Game of Thrones coming
to a conclusion soon, HBO
wisely realised that it needed
a new cash-cow behemoth to
keep the money ticking over.
Enter, Westworld. A slick,
excelllently performed sci-fi
drama with high production
values, this show looks to be
doing for sci-fi what Game of
Thrones did for fantasy. And
to think, it’s all derived from
a semi-obscure Yule Brenner
movie. Westworld’s first
season has kept us hooked.
Here’s to many more.

WhenJohnStewartretiredlast
year, the collective western
liberal community let out a
mournful wail. Thankfully,
however, he had not left us
without contingencies. A host
of successor shows popped
up to fill the void, including
the retooled Daily Show.
However, none of them quite
managed to match up to the
ferrocity and wit of Stewart’s
original. That is, of course.
until Daily Show veteran Sam
Bee’s Full Frontal.
Full Frontal | TBS
Based on Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s award winning 2013
Edinburgh play of the same name, Fleabag tells the story
of a young woman’s attempts at getting through modern
London life. It’s humour and razor sharp and pitch black,
and the show manages to hook in just enough moments
of genuine emotion and drama to keep you interested
throughout its all too short 6 episode run.
