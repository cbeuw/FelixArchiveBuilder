CANCER
VIRGO
This week the Union
organises a surprise
waste amnesty party.
You get to throw away
all that shit your club has
accumulated over the
years, including that bag
of asbestos.

This week you spot
a typo in felix. You’re
late to the party
mate. L-A-T-W
This week you – fuck
this. Bye. I’m off. Happy
holidays.
This week you insist
that misgendering
someone isn’t that bad
and really doesn’t
warrant an apology.
Shame. Shame.
Shame. Shame.
This week you get laid
seven times in metric
after reading our one
night stand guide. You’re
welcome.
This week you get
stood up by your date.
It was with your second
cousin but it’s fine.
Incest is the new black.
This week you pass an
acquaintance in the street
and think they’re waving
at you. They’re not –
OMG wait a minute they
were! This never happens!
This week you go to IC
Cinema. And by go to
IC Cinema I mean you
pirate every blockbuster
from 2016 and watch
them on your laptop, in
your room, alone.
This week you return
to the motherland.
The motherland is
Sheffield. You’re
immediately bored
and life sucks. You
can’t wait to return to
London.
This week you shave
your balls. They’re
so smooth you can’t
keep your hands off
them. You promptly
get arrested for public
indecency.
This week you get an
empty jar from your
secret santa. Upon further
examination you realise it’s
labeled cis-girl tears.
This week you’re the
union staff exodus.
There’s no stopping
you and no way to tell
what the aftermath will
be. FELIX fears for this
institution’s future.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
This has been such a shit year. I haven’t achieved any-
thing. My grades are crap, my social life is questionable,
my love life is non-existent, even my masturbation routine
is unsatisfactory.
2016 was meant to be THE year. I left my town and came
to London to study, full of hopes and dreams. But all of
them have been crushed by the clusterfuck that has been
2016.
Help. I don’t know what to do. How do I seize 2017?
What do I draw motivation from?
Yours,
Hope L.S.
Hey Hope!
I don’t think 2016 is the problem. I think the
problem at hand is you. All these years in this
line of business mean I know a moaner when I
see one. And you hun are definitely a moaner
(if not a screamer).
Stop blaming your shitty life on events you
have no control over. So what if the govern-
ment decided to fuck over students and cut
bursaries? Just don’t be shit at life and make
sure you earn a lot of money after you gradu-
ate to repay those student loans!
So what if one of the world’s most powerful
countries is now led by a misogynist? Just
make sure you dress appropriately (remember
appropriate dressing varies depending on
which man you ask.)
HOROSCOPES
Getting good grades, a life, a significant other
and a mean wanking technique is in the hands
of none other than yourself.
As for motivation, don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll
find some by the end of the year (or fail).
I was in your shoes back in 2005. My life
was... Let’s just say sub-optimal (my diet mainly
consisted of baked beans and estragon and
I was in a relationship with a kleptomaniac
rabbi). But I took a look in the mirror and
stared myself down until I changed.
And if that fails, the fear of dying alone should
be all the motivation you need.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
