2016: a #food round up
2016 hasn’t actually been as shit for
food as it has been for everything
else. felix examines the top 5 food
trends of 2016 – everything from
Poké, a raw fish salad, to giant crepe
layer cakes.
dessert scene by Lady M, a
cake boutique in the Upper
East Side, their mille crêpe
cake has graced different
parts of the world, attracting
hour-long queues for a slice
of their signature cake in a
multitude of flavours: lemon,
chocolate, coconut and of
course, green tea.
Although Lady M has yet to
set foot on the British Isles, a
few cafés have caught on the
trend and became pioneers
to bring this wonderful new
dessert to London. Kova
Patisserie, a new addition to
the Soho food scene, stocks
their handmade mille crêpe
cakes in their glass shelves
in green tea, chocolate
and fruit, selling out by 3
N
umber 1.
Green Tea.
You know
that green
tea has finally
taken over the
land of boring English Break-
fast when even Starbucks has
added a green tea latte to
their permanent menu. Green
tea has always been a popu-
lar drink in Asia for its many
health benefits. Not only is it
your best coffee alternative,
it’s herby, earthy and bitter-
sweet notes have deemed to
be a great addition to any
dessert, from cakes to ice
cream to even KitKats, attract-
ing an unimaginable craze to
any green tea flavoured food
product.
While many Londoners are
still scratching their heads and
trying to adjust their palette
to the odd, green-coloured,
grassy-flavoured ice cream,
many green tea-themed cafes
have opened their doors to
welcome the curious and
the homesick (that is, sad,
green tea-deprived overseas
students like myself). Visit
Tsujiri, a Japanese tea house
that has recently expanded
to London, for a taste of
authentic matcha in the form
of ice cream and many other
traditional desserts. Head
over to Soft Serve Society at
Boxpark Shoreditch for their
creamy matcha ice cream
(with sugar stars) in a mini-
malist, tumblr-esque setting.
Crosstown Doughnuts incor-
porates full-on greenness into
their matcha tea doughnut,
complete with a cake dough
and green tea ganache.
If you cannot be bothered
to go that far, there is always
Tombo, a 5 minutes walk
away, with their shelves full
of green tea cakes, brownies
and chocolate.
Number 2. Street food.
The street food trend has
stayed strong throughout the
past few years and is growing
even stronger, with more and
more people embracing the
creative, multi-cultural and
affordable menus of these
independent stalls at many
market locations across
London. A visit to a food
market, munching on burgers
and letting the juices drip all
over, has become an enjoya-
ble pastime on the weekend.
Maltby Street and Druid
Street Markets near London
Bridge has risen to fame,
packed with visitors during
the weekends for oysters,
waffles and local produce.
New additions to the street
food market scene this year
include KERB Camden, a
small collection of stalls open
7-days a week featuring Oli
Baba’s scrummy halloumi
fries, and Flat Iron Square,
an exciting hub of indie street
food kitchens open daily,
plus a flea market during the
weekend.
Number 3. Dominique Ansel
The creator of The Cronut®
deserves his own category.
The patisserie has finally put
London into his pocket in
September after opening suc-
cessful bakeries in New York
and Tokyo, bringing major
queues outside his bright
yellow awning every morning
for a flake of his Cronut®.
The Cronut® has a different
flavour every month, compli-
mented by Ansel’s many other
equally delicious pastries
and desserts. If the crois-
sant-doughnut hybrid is not
reached the grey, miserable,
rocky British beaches all the
way from sun-kissed, tropical
shores of Hawaii. The col-
ourful, healthy summer bowl
of marinated raw fish cubes
on rice has decided to stay
through to the sub-zero days
of December, with a grow-
ing number of restaurants
transforming the recipe by
exchanging rice with purple
rice, quinoa, and even kale.
Our wonderful neighbour
Tombo has opened their own
Poké-dedicated bar in Soho,
serving bowls with a more
Japanese taste. Ahi Poké near
Tottenham Court Road has
a fully customizable menu
giving you full freedom from
your base, the fish, and all the
way through to the sauce. The
newly opened Island Poké
in Carnaby also serves the
best acai bowls in London on
top of their Poké menu. Carb
loading the Poké way.
Number 5. Mille Crêpe.
Imagine 20 layers of paper-
thin crêpes stacked on top
one another with layers of
cream between them. That,
my friends, is a mille crêpe
cake.
First brought into the global
Christy Lam
enough to satisfy your sugar
cravings, go for a Frozen
S’more (toasted marshmallow
with vanilla custard ice cream
on a stick), a DKA (which
stands for Dominique’s Kouign
Amann), or a chocolate chip
cookie shot at 3 pm on the
dot.
Number 4. Poke the Poké
The poké waves have finally
pm every day. Sosharu, an
upscale Japanese restaurant
in Farringdon, features their
green tea mille crêpe cake on
their dessert menu. Nojo in
Old Street tube station, serves
their gluten-free green tea
version alongside their other
healthy, gluten-free crêpes
and treats. The mille crêpe
cake is still taking its baby
steps in the UK, with great
potential to grow in the year
ahead.

One of the most notable food writers
and critics of the 21st century, AA
Gill passed away last week following
a battle with cancer. Here are some
thoughts from a fan.

AA Gill is away
T
he journalist AA
Gill, The Sunday
Times food (and
occasionally TV)
critic, died last
week, only three
weeks after writing about his
cancer diagnosis in his weekly
column.
He broke the news with the
kind sumptuousness of words
he used in his criticisms; writ-
ing “there is barely a morsel
of offal that is not included.
I have a trucker’s gut-buster,
gimpy, malevolent, meaty
malignancy.” These were
the kinds of turns of phrase
that distinguished him from
all other writers – he had
an almost archaic way of
to copy takers. Keeping
the typists at the end of the
line, as well as the readers
picking up the writing in print
entertained must then have
been the challenge. It was a
challenge to which he took
to with gusto. One got the
distinct impression that he
relished eviscerating those
who did not meet his exact-
ing standards, or when he
wanted to court controversy.
He was regularly regarded as
writing, as if his descriptions
had run away from him whilst
he was speaking. It was a
type of writing that was so
particular to him, perhaps
precisely because he did not
write like most journalists do.
Profoundly dyslexic, words,
to which he had dedicated
his whole working life, did
not come naturally to him,
so he dictated his columns,
his essays, and his novels
a snob (he wore only Savile
Row suits lined with Hermes
scarves), and frequently a
misogynist – he once referred
to Clare Balding as a ‘dyke
on a bike’, and historian
Mary Beard as too ugly to be
on television, his own partner
of more than twenty years,
Nicola Formby, often starred
in his columns referred only
by the moniker ‘the Blonde’.
For all his failings and his
snobbery he could sometimes
reveal the full enormity of
his generosity of spirit – in
February he wrote a deeply
moving review of the can-
teens that had sprung up in
the Jungle refugee camp in
which he likened the act of
the refugees setting up camp
by a river and gathering to
eat at the beginnings of every
civilization. In announcing
Gill’s death, Tim Shipman,
political editor of the Sunday
Times, wrote: “AA Gill, the
writer who first made me buy
the Sunday Times, the best
of us for 30 years, has died.
Very sombre mood in the
office.” AA Gill wasn’t the
reason I bought The Sunday
Times, but his columns were
the first pieces I turned to in
the paper, always feeling a
twinge of disappointment
when the line ‘AA Gill is
away’ appeared in fine print
at the bottom of his regular
food column Table Talk . No
one else wrote quite like AA
Gill, and it is hard to imagine
that anyone ever will.
EU Xmas
Or, around the glorious federation
in a delicious meal. Follow felix on
a tour of some traditional christmas
delicacies from countries across
Europe. Bonus points if you’re sober
at the end.
I
t’s time to get ready for
the Christmas dinner – if
you already had it, well,
it’s never too late to have
a second or third one.
I mean, it’s Christmas –
you can celebrate it as many
times as you want. And now
that you are a student, time
to try something different.
I’m not saying that the food
Andrada Balmez
your mom has made in the
past (well, your whole life,
actually) is not good, just
that you deserve a change –
and go international! Or, if
you come from one of those
countries/families that don’t
make such a big fuss about
Christmas, celebrate it with
style for the first time.
Start your Christmas dinner
French – l’aperitif must be
French. Have some foie gras
on slices of bread and some
smoked salmon – the pre-
tentious kind, served in small
bites. Of course, have wine
and cheese from France too.
Continue it with some Roma-
nian traditional “sarmale”
– really just some cabbage
leaves stuffed with a minced
pork and beef mixture
– served with warm “mama-
liga” – polenta cooked in a
really delicious way: boiled in
water until it’s thick and then
baked a bit in the oven – with
some cream.
Time to have German
drinks, too. I don’t have to
spell it out for you: beer. Or, if
you feel brave enough, go all
Russian, but don’t mix them,
and try to enjoy an almost
sober Christmas party. Try
some Czech salad: potatoes
with mayonnaise, hard-boiled
eggs and boiled veggies. You
can eat it as a main dish, too.
Make your Christmas
table look gorgeous with
the Austrian traditional pig
head – it tastes even better
than it looks and if you want
some delicacy – pig cheeks.
Or, if you fancy some poultry,
you can return to France with
their amazing dinde aux
marrons – another fancy way
of cooking turkey, but, hey,
it’s Christmas so you must go
fancy! And complement it
with something you cannot
pronounce yourself: Rødkål
(red cabbage).
Time for the best part –
dessert! I recommend Italian,
panettone with zabaglione
cream. I know you under-
stand me, and it’s not a bad
decision to invest in a good
one. Don’t forget the “British”
part – you must celebrate the
country you currently live in
– with a gingerbread house.
You will get extra points if you
actually bake and assemble it
yourself, but you can totally
rock the table with a good
looking bought one. Really,
any dessert will do, but make
sure that it either has a lot of
chocolate or it’s damn good.
End in style with some hot
chocolate and stroopwafflen
– compliments to the Dutch.
P.S. you can, if you want,
go all Japanese and have
KFC. No, I’m not crazy – they
really do go wild for fried
chicken at Christmas!
\\ I’m not saying
that the food your
mom has made in
the past (well, your
whole life, actually)
is not good, just
that you deserve a
change \\
