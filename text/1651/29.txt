hristmas should be
about two things,
and two things
only: celebrating
the birth of baby
Jesus and shunning
any members of your family who
have announced they are sick with
the gay plague. Last year cousin
Dave announced he had been ill
for some time at Christmas dinner
and I projectile vomited across
the table onto him, so this year
of course I’ve bought him a car
battery and electrodes in order for
him to convert himself. Hopefully
he will manage to do it before the
pigs in blankets come out of the
oven. There is truly no better way
of honouring the King of the Jews
than by eating phallic pig flesh
wrapped in thin pig flesh.
Another thing that pulls my testi-
cles during the Christmas season
(other than your mum), is these lib-
eral-joy-apologists who denounce
using the name Christmas. If
you are so mentally deluded as
to celebrate a Christian festival
despite having no particular belief
in the Almighty, then you should
just go become a desert-dweller
in the Middle East and live of off
hummus. “Oh I just don’t want to
exclude anybody so I use Xmas.”
FUCK OFF YOU COMMUNIST.
“The Modern-day Christmas has
become so far removed from
the roots of the festival, I feel as
though it is no longer a religious
festival.” I’LL EAT YOUR PRESENTS
THEN SHALL I? “I’m Jewish so I cel-
ebrate Hanukkah instead.” YOUR
PEOPLE KILLED BABY JESUS STOP
TRYING TO MAKE EXCUSES.
Also, if you want to give me a
present, it had better be made in
the UK or the USA, because if I see
the vaguest hint of Chinese influ-
ence, I shall burn it in front of you
whilst playing the national anthem
to repel the communist demons
they put in their products.
As I look back on the year,
however, there are many things to
be thankful for. Barack HUSSEIN
Obama will finally be relinquish-
ing his anti-white grasp upon our
house, and we will finally have a
leader who is savvy about business
and will crush the Muslamic threat
to the civilised world. Brexit now
means that we will be able to
deport anybody vaguely ethnic
next year as soon as Act 56 or
whatever it is called is activated.
Finally the mental illness of political
correctness will also be stamped
out, allowing for us to call out
those who wish to stop the four
horses of the apocalypse and the
eventual day of judgement will be
called and all you non-believers
will be sent to the darkest depths
of hell.
C
hristmas is too often
the focus of our end
of year celebrations,
wrapped in
commercialism and
the celebration
of consuming animal corpses. I
however, reject this imperialist-
white-christian tradition in favour of
a tradition far more relevant to my
soul and spirit animal. This, for me,
is kwanzaa. Granted I am a white
middle-class man from Surrey,
but I have always had an affinity
for the motherland (jah rastafah).
Since I live in Shepherd’s Bush, It
is easy to get traditional African
dress although I do receive a lot
more odd looks from strangers
when I am in my kanzu. I feel this is
probably because I have become
less influenced by the colonialist
West than they have, and so it is
natural for them to feel jealous. I
just want to reach out to any of my
African brothers, and if they feel as
though they have lost their way in
this white man’s world, I can help
them return to becoming one with
Africa.
If you are too regressive in your
western imperial ways and decide
to celebrate CHRIST-MASS then I
also have a few unsolicited tips for
making your Christmas less fun, but
more morally and spiritually sound.
In a lot of ways I feel like I already
write a column for the Guardian,
as I too am trying to make people
more miserable at the cost of being
slightly more socially conscious.
My first piece of advice is to, of
course, learn to love nuts and their
affiliated roasts, as this is all I ate
at Christmas when I was enslaved
by white culture. The most common
problem with nuts at Christmas is
that they are too wrinkly. When
someone puts their freshly made
nuts in your mouth they should be
soft and plump and not too difficult
to suck on. Whenever I have to put
nuts in my mouth, I usually soak
them in some warm water so that
they taste fairly good when they’re
going down my throat.
I also implore you, dear readers,
to acknowledge your trees’ gender
before you start to decorate it willy
nilly. Too often do I see the festive
basket of deplorables bestow this
heteronormative decoration of
tinsel and baubles, without any
acknowledgement of the tree’s
preferred pronouns. If your tree
chooses to identify itself as male,
please consider to treat it as such:
start decorating it with steaks and
cars, and pay 9.4% more for the
tree as it will be working harder
as well as not having to taken time
off for self-indulgent pregnancy.
THE WORLD IS OVERPOPULATED
PEOPLE.
In whatever capacity you choose
to celebrate winter festivities, I
hope you honestly have a good
time off; however, do not forget
that whilst you’re enjoying your
turkey, hundreds of Syrian nation-
als will die under Assad’s regime.
God I’m good. I hope the Guard-
ian notice me soon.
Reject the
commercialisation of
Christmas and get back
to your African roots
