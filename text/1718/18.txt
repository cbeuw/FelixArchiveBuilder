C
orsets and
c o g w h e e l s ,
leather and lace:
what would
the Victorian era have
looked like if electricity
hadn’t been discovered
and steam technology
had prevailed? Throw in
a little fantasy, a little sci-
ence fiction, and you have
the steampunk movement
– a weirdly intriguing
combination of Victorian
aesthetics and industrial
steam-powered machin-
ery. That’s the world that
artist Gary Nicholls is
exploring in his ambitious
trilogy The Imaginarium,
a staged ‘photojournalis-
tic’ series that offers us a
glimpse into the fictional
life of Eva, a heroine and
adventuress from the fan-
tastical steampunk world
of Nicholls’ imagination.
Each photo is a composite
of multiple, sometimes
hundreds, of images, with
the finished look seam-
lessly stitched together
in Photoshop. I had the
pleasure of speaking to
Nicholls at the Talented
Art Fair this March to find
out more about his work:
Why have you chosen
to photograph
the models and
the background
separately, rather
than the whole scene
at the same time?
Mostly because they
couldn’t all make the
shoot at once. I rely on
people who make time
for the shoot - I don’t pay
anybody for this because
they want to do it, they
want to be part of it. And
it’s consistent because all
of those people in all of
the images are acting - I
tell them what to do, and
they take on the character.
Tell me more about
the backgrounds.
I’ve taken 8 and a half
thousand pictures just to
get the hundred and fifty
that are in this book. It’s
not just about picking
the best image, it’s also
because of the places I go
to. (Points at photo) That
place doesn’t exist. It’s
made of all the different
places I’ve been to and
photographed. I take
elements from each one
and put them all together.
Do you ever
photograph your
subjects in the
landscape?
No, always separately.
That way I can control
the light. I studied the
way that Caravaggio
and Vermeer used paint-
brushes to create light. If
you look at any of their
works, the background’s
not out of focus as it
would be with a camera,
it’s detailed. All my
backgrounds are detailed.
The only reason why you
look where I want you to
look is because of the way
they’re lit.
That’s very interesting.
So it would actually
be more detailed than
you were taking a
photo from the front,
with a camera.
Yes. I’m known for my
detail. And again, these
prints are printed on metal
- it’s called Chromelux.
The light goes through the
image and gets reflected
back, making the images
look like they’re backlit.
And why steampunk?
I was looking for a
theme, for just six pictures
initially. I actually read an
magazine article about
how to create a steampunk
image in Photoshop, and
I thought: People must
do this for real. Googled
it, found the Lincoln
Steampunk Festival (now
the biggest in the world)
and went there in 2012
and met loads of people.
We created some images
together and I thought,
this is bigger than just 6
images, maybe I’ll just
expand it into a little short
story. And now it’s ended
up as a 450 image trilogy!
Wow, that’s amazing.
There will be a film
or a TV series at the end
of it too. It’s been mad.
Really, it’s about using
your imagination to create
something that captures
someone else’s imagina-
tion. Not everybody will
like this, that’s for sure,
but if it makes them stop
and think, then - at least
it’s got a reaction. It’s also
about all the people that I
meet.
Your models, are
they people from the
steampunk scene?
Yes. So every person
in my story is a genuine
steampunk, that’s my rule.
Can’t be in it if you’re not.
You have to be a steam-
punk because if you are,
you get it. You understand
what I’m trying to do, and
therefore when you’re
acting, you take on that
character.
And do you feel
that you’ve joined
the steampunk
community yourself?
Oh yes. Absolutely! I
wasn’t, but amazingly, the
Photoshop magazine that I
first read about steampunk
in - they just did a feature
on me and my work. So
it’s sort of gone full circle.
Amazing. And after
the trilogy is over, will
you still continue with
steampunk?
Yes. My next project is
going to be a steampunk
post-apocalyptic story.
And even before that, in
my final book, I’m going
around the world to pho-
tograph 4000 steampunks
from different countries,
and combine them into a
huge Lord of the Rings
style battle scene.
What a massive
project.
Yes. I’m completely
mad. It is good though,
I really enjoy it. It’s just
that my art takes a long
time to produce because
so much time goes into
each image.
Any final thoughts?
If you have something
inside you that you really
want to do, whether it’s
to write a book, paint a
picture, compose music
– whatever it is, be a bit
selfish about it and go and
do it. Because time passes
by too quick. Be selfish
with yourself and go and
do it. It’s never too late.
