your heart”.
The final three songs
reassert the band’s
message and make sure
that the album doesn’t just
peter out. The imagery of
‘Selené’, another Tame
Impala-esque tune, is the
most drastic on the album.
There’s drug excess -
“Who took a lil’ too much
speed and fucked his guts
up and his teeth”, and
some wonderful thoughts
on… the dual separatory
and uniting aspects of skin
– “Love your skin, it holds
your organs in / Though it
holds me away from you”,
all with the message of
“Now you can bleed on
me”. As surreal as Dali,
but certainly evocative. It
is followed by the irony of
fate in ‘Shame’ - “It was
probably just a cracker,
it’s the 14th of July” –
once again bringing up the
theme of revolution, this
time the French, but now
putting it side by side with
the violence that accom-
panied the celebrations on
Bastille day three years
ago. The seeds of hatred
for Nick (he IS an Aussie
after all) were apparently
sown by evil institutions
and inventions alike
“I’m sorry for everything
we’ve done / I’m sorry
for the glory of the Queen
/ The glory of the gun.”
Shame indeed.
The final track,
‘Doctor’s In’, starts with
such a Pink Floyd-es-
que tone, that I almost
expected to hear Waters
screaming into my ears
when the lyrics came
in. #Disappointed. The
synths sound like the un-
derwater siren sounds that
drone on just before the
beginning of the last salvo
in ‘Echoes’ while the
guitar sounds just like the
one in the intro to ‘Sheep’.
Truly a psychedelic
throwback. And the lyrics
sound like something that
the prog gods wouldn’t be
ashamed to call their own,
either. It paints a picture
of nature and gives a sense
of purity, of that quality of
rebirth that only trees and
birds and flowers in the
spring months posses –
with this taking us back to
the first lines of the album,
but now giving them a
new twist.
The bad trip has ended,
our subject has faced
his fears and is ready for
what lays ahead. The
words of encouragement
are moving, constructive,
and, to me, show that the
band realises that simply
painting a picture of all
the shitstains present all
around isn’t the point of
great art.
The point is to be able
to point to a power of
renewal, a replenishing
greatness which is just
waiting to be found in
the nature that surrounds
us, to give clues as to
what might be able to
make everything better.
And though in Daisy
they sing “sometimes
you gotta rock the cradle
on your own”, the rest of
the album convinces us
that in that cradle there is
hidden the potential for all
that’s good in the world.
And that it will come true.
“But don’t be defeated
by the coming night / By
the wind that’s blowing
as cold as ice.” Pond, I
promise I won’t! And you
shouldn’t either.
T
oo young to fully
engage with the
m o n u m e n t a l
breakthrough of
Arctic Monkeys, but too
old to care the slightest
bit about the 1975, Foals
were MY band. Despite
only receiving my backing
in earnest following their
third album (2013’s Holy
Fire), they soundtracked
such a pivotal part of my
adolescence that for me,
as far as British indie
music was concerned,
they were everything.
Dropping in 2008,
debut album Antidotes
featured angular guitars,
occasional brass interjec-
tions, and largely non-
sensical lyrics (including
some in French), making
it a bizarre but undeniably
fun math rock piece.
2010’s Total Life Forever
brought a different band
entirely. Crisp, funk-in-
flected rhythms ushered in
a far more mature sound,
and frontman Yannis
Philippakis showed
the full wonder of his
voice, particularly on
the record’s epic centre-
piece, ‘Spanish Sahara’.
Having won acclaim, they
decided to go big. The
muscular, anthemic rock
of follow-up Holy Fire
was a chart success, and
paved the way for huge
headline sets.
They’d found their
winning formula and so
they, in what I imagine
they’d thought was a
sensible move, nigh on
replicated it for 2015’s
What Went Down.
Sadly, for many (myself
included, just a month
before starting university)
something was lacking. It
felt derivative; many of
the tracks had direct ana-
logues on the previous LP
(e.g. ‘London Thunder’ &
‘Late Night’, ‘Mountain
At My Gates’ & ‘My
Number’) but without the
original energy. Given the
mixed reviews, combined
with their reputation as
one of the best live bands
around, it’s no surprise
that they dedicated the
following few years to
full albums, Everything
Not Saved Will Be Lost,
parts 1 and 2, the second
of which is anticipated to
drop in September.
From the ethereal
synths that open the LP
with ‘Moonlight’, it’s im-
mediately clear that this
is something new. Well
aware of the ever-loos-
ening hold guitar music
has on today’s musical
landscape, Philippakis
and co. have allowed
electronic and experimen-
tal techniques to permeate
the record. At their most
prominent, ‘In Degrees’
is borderline disco, and
wouldn’t feel out of place
in a Hot Chip set, while
the tinkling vibraphones
and distant wails of ‘Café
D’Athens’are reminiscent
of Moon Shaped Pool-era
Radiohead.
There is some familiar-
ity though; the throbbing
stadium rock of ‘White
Onions’ is sure to become
a staple of their live sets,
after stagnating for three
minutes, ‘Syrups’ gives
us that cymbal-crashing
shift of gear that Foals
are known and loved for,
and the chirpy, textured
bounce of ‘On the Luna’
sounds like every song off
Total Life Forever played
at once.
It all culminates in
the penultimate track
‘Sunday’, a two-part
odyssey that swings from
melancholic slow burner
to 90s rave, before lullaby
‘I’m Done With the World
(& It’s Done With Me)’
rounds off the album. It’s
not without imperfections
– the album version of
‘Exits’ lingers, making
it somewhat less punchy
than its single counterpart,
and despite its efforts, the
radical change is not all
that extreme. But, for me
at least, it’s served as a
strong reminder of why I
fell in love with them in
the first place. Bring on
part 2.

After a six year break from the music scene, Dido is
still on my mind
The release, which sees Dido contemplating marriage and motherhood, comes ahead of tours across the UK,
Europe, and North America - her first in 15 years.
A
warm cup of
tea on a cold
day – this is
how I’d best
sum up Dido. Though
unassuming both in the
recording studio and out,
she’s managed to feature
twice on the list of the top
ten best-selling albums of
the noughties and wrack
up four BRITAwards. Her
first two albums No Angel
and Life for Rent topped
the UK year-end charts
in 2001 and 2003, and the
two albums since, Safe
Trip Home and Girl Who
Got Away, were moderate
commercial successes
despite not reaching the
heights of her early career.
It’s safe to say that she’s
earned a spot amongst
the greatest British solo
artists, but it’s been
six years since her last
album– does she still have
the hit-making chops, or
has the tea gone cold on
Dido’s musical career?
Still on My Mind,
released last Friday,
doesn’t deviate signif-
icantly from the Dido
formula of signature
wispy vocals on soft
acoustic instrumentals
that has served her so
well. In fact, many of the
tracks wouldn’t be out of
place in her debut album
No Angel. Both place
greater emphasis on the
instrumentals, opting for
particularly percussion
heavy numbers and
extended breaks within
songs. Thematically,
however, the two records
are very different. No
Angel, first released when
Dido was still in her 20s,
has a focus on the highs
and lows of a relationship
and accepting that she
isn’t perfect, with a few
slides into narratives of
low points in her life
and recognising the lack
of permanence in these.
Coming two years later,
Life for Rent also has
many titles about relation-
ships, but Dido begins to
explore different themes.
Particularly in the titular
track ‘Life for Rent’, we
see a more retrospective
and contemplative side to
Dido as she croons “But if
my life is for rent / and I
don’t learn to buy / Well I
deserve nothing more than
I get ‘cause nothing I have
is truly mine”. This side
becomes more and more
prominent as time goes
on; third album Safe Trip
Home focussing heavily
on Dido’s loss of her
father, while fourth album
Girl Who Got Away deals
with her almost gleeful
acceptance that she’s not
“Following
four albums of
relationship
tumult, it
seems from
this track
that Dido has
finally found
some stability”
quite “sitting on the roof
of the world” anymore.
This trend continues to
Still on My Mind. Opening
track ‘Hurricanes’ is
harrowing, yet oddly
uplifting; lyrics “Let me
face the sound and fury /
Let me face hurricanes”
are fitting as the song
progresses with various
instruments being added
in succession to a cacoph-
onous climax followed by
silence. Following four
albums of relationship
tumult, it seems from this
track that Dido has finally
found some stability in
her relationship and is
ready to face hurricanes
with her husband. It’s
almost a completion of a
five-album story arc, and
many of the later songs
seem to be reflections on
life experiences rather
than of how she currently
feels.
The lead single ‘Give
You Up’ perhaps strays
furthest away from what
we traditionally expect
from Dido. It’s one of
the few Dido songs with
a piano led composition,
and features backing
vocals that put you in
mind of Hawaiian folk
music. With as much
serenity and delicacy as
with all her lyrics, Dido
talks of breaking away
from an unhealthy rela-
tionship and accepting the
consequences – “I found
a way to let you go / It’s
gonna rip your heart out”.
Though maybe not quite
the relentless earworm
of previous singles like
‘White Flag’ and ‘Thank
You’, ‘Give You Up’ still
gets you humming for
hours after.
More upbeat mid-re-
cord tracks ‘Hell After
This’ and ‘Take You
Home’ both deal with
positive experiences in
relationships in a light
sense. While far from
being dancefloor fillers,
they’re needed breaks
from slower, more sombre
tracks. The final few
tracks are very familiar
Dido. Each of her albums
feature one sassy, musical
version of a subtweet
song and this manifests
in ‘Friends’ which is a
very enjoyable, easy-on-
the-ears pop ditty. Dido
closes the album with
‘Have to Stay’, a poignant
ode to motherhood that
most directly reflects
her current stage in life.
The instrumental is very
gentle, allowing Dido’s
voice (her greatest asset)
to connect to the listener.
“I’m here as long as you
need / When you show
you’re / Okay on your
own / I’ll smile and leave”
perfectly encapsulates the
feel of the song, and the
general theme of content
in the permanence of
motherhood.
Still on My Mind was a
personal project for Dido
– much of it was recorded
at the home of her brother
and long-term co-produc-
er Rollo, and produced
by the two of them. The
production quality, none-
theless, is one of the best
from her albums so far.
The album holds up well
to all releases across her
20-year career and was
worth the wait. Confident
serenity permeates every
song, and Dido’s delicate
vocals are showcased as
always. How long will
it be until Dido’s next
release? Who knows,
really. She’s quite upfront
about not feeling any
pressure to create music
and is driven by a love of
creating music with her
brother. But this album
shows that Dido can still
produce quality records
and achieve success in
the current market (it’s
too early to give a chart
position, but Still on
My Mind was 3rd in the
mid-week update). She’s
going on tour for the first
time in 15 years this year,
and I’m looking forward
to what comes next for
Dido, even if it’s another
decade until we get some
new music.
