mperial Alpha, a
team of five con-
sisting of members
from the Energy
Society, won 3rd
place in
the ESCP Energy Trading
Competition 2019. This
year, over 40 teams partic-
ipated in the competition,
including a total of seven
teams from Imperial
College. Imperial Alpha,
described by the competi-
tion director as the “team
with a consistently strong
performance”, finished
four trading sessions with
170 points, only seven
points less than first
place, and with a profit of
$45million. This was the
best result achieved by an
Imperial team to date.
The team consisted of
and was captained by Yu
(Ronnie) Zhang, a PhD
working on energy trans-
portation optimisation,
Adam Isenberg (Business
School), Bob Xu (Materi-
als PhD), Ernesto Ignacio
(ESE PhD) and Gianpiero
Placidi (Chemistry UG).
The trading compe-
tition uses a fundamen-
tal-driven crude oil futures
market, carried through
a web-based trading
simulator developed by
ESCP Business School.
Four products formed
the basis of the market:
WTI, Brent, Heating Oil
and Gasoil, and various
spreads were employed
to limit outright exposure.
In practice, most teams
used a combination of

necessary tension between
Russia and the UK. The
market reacted most
violently at the beginning,
creating large volatility
as the news developed.
Huge profits and losses
were generated across the
floor, and the air reached a
critical point when Russia
suddenly opted out of
the negotiation. Later,
the European oil price
gradually lost momentum
as tensions softened via
German intervention, re-
sulting in bearish trading
activity. The competition
finished with a sudden an-
nouncement from OPEC,
claiming to cut supply
across all member coun-
tries. Overall, Imperial
Alphamanagedtoproduce
a strong performance out
of the turmoil and profited
in all four trading sessions
thanks to solid analysis
and teamwork.
Looking back, the
competition offered an
unparalleled opportunity
to learn and compete
in energy trading. The
trading platform was pro-
fessionally designed, and
the market response was
indeed close to reality.
At the same time, it was
a great pleasure to meet
and interact with students
from a wide variety of
backgrounds.
Imperial Alpha was
first formed two months
prior to the competition,
during which the team
carried out extensive
studies into the crude
market fundamentals, as
well as trading exercises
through online platforms.
Nonetheless, many
concepts were new to the
team until met in practice.
Fortunately, the team
managed to adapt quickly
from the beginning, and
employed a strategy that
involved small trading
in the opening hours to
minimise losses, followed
by maxing out on limits
when more confident on
the market direction.
To begin with, the team
used a classic trading
house model, where the
US and European market
were covered by two
teams of two, with a risk
manager overlooking
the overall position and
exposure. This freedom
in opinions allowed the
team to benefit from the
greatest diversity in the
The competition was
divided into two days;
after the first few quiet
hours of learning and
adaptation to the trading
platform, most teams soon
became more active and
the rooms adopted a trad-
ing-floor-like atmosphere.
Most of the shouting and
cheering happened on
the second day when a
Russian plane caused un-
belts, we believe future
Imperial teams will have
an even better chance
to win the ESCP energy
trading competition in
2020. All members of
Imperial Alpha would like
to take this opportunity to
thank the Energy Society
for the support during and
before the competition.
