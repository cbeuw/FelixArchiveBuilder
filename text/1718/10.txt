New cholesterol-lowering drug could help patients
unable to take statins
“Not only is
the treatment
well-tolerated,
and potentially
safe over
longer
periods, but
it also further
reduces LDL
cholesterol
when
combined
with other
treatments”
A
new class of oral
cholesterol-low-
ering drug could
help patients
unable to take statins due
to side effects.
The findings come from
the largest study to date
to test the effectiveness
and safety of bempedoic
acid, an oral medication
- yet to be approved in
Europe - which inhibits
the body’s ability to create
the building blocks of
cholesterol.
The research, published
today in the New England
Journal of Medicine and
funded by US pharmaceu-
tical company Esperion
Therapeutics, reports on
findings from more than
2,200 patients and is the
first to measure the safety
and effectiveness of the
new treatment against
placebo in patients with
increased risk of heart
attack and stroke.
According to the
group behind the study,
the cholesterol-lowering
treatment could be added
to patients’ existing
drug regimens as well as
providing an option for
people who are unable to
tolerate statins due to side
effects such as muscle
pain or bad interactions
with other medications.
The researchers add
that the drug may also
be suitable for patients
who require higher
doses of statins but take
less-effective cholester-
ol-lowering medications
(such as ezetimibe) or the
highly effective but far
more expensive injected
treatments (PCSK9-inhib-
itors).
Professor Kausik Ray,
from Imperial College
London’s School of
Public Health, who led the
study, said:
“What we have is a new
class of drug that could be
given to patients who are
already taking statins and
could help them to further
reduce their cholesterol
levels and thus potentially
cut their risk of heart
attacks and strokes.”
In the latest study, a
total of 2,230 patients
with high cholesterol
levels and taking cho-
lesterol-lowering drugs
were randomly chosen
to receive either the new
treatment or placebo for
one year.
After three months
of treatment researchers
found that bempedoic acid
reduced patients’ LDL
cholesterol levels from
baseline by an average of
18.1% compared to the
placebo group.
In addition, they found
that the treatment was ef-
fective irrespective of the
intensity of the patient’s
existing cholesterol-low-
ering treatment.
The treatment was also
shown to be well-toler-
ated by patients, with
some increased incidence
of gout - due to slight
increases in levels of uric
acid in the blood - but no
increased incidence of
serious health conditions
between the two groups.
In a second study, also
published in the NEJM,
the team looked at data
from more than half a
million people and used
genetic markers to model
the likely effects of the
treatment over a longer
period. They found that
the effects of inhibiting
the enzyme over longer
time scale reduced the risk
of cardiovascular disease
with no obvious adverse
effects of blocking this
pathway. The benefit was
identical to that expected
as though blocking the
enzyme targeted by statins
when individuals were
matched for change in
cholesterol.
Professor Ray added:
“One of the key advan-
tages of bempedoic acid
is supposed to be that it
shouldn’tcausethemuscle
side effects reported by
some statins users. It could
be an option for patients
who are unable to tolerate
statins at higher doses, or
at all. Our genetic studies
suggest that the benefit
on prevention of heart
disease and strokes in
ongoing trials should be
identical to that achieved
through statins.”
“Overall, these latest
studies show that not only
is the treatment generally
well-tolerated being
comparable with placebo,
and potentially safe over
longer periods, but that
when added to high in-
tensity statin treatment it
can help to further reduce
LDL cholesterol levels.
The ongoing trial, called
‘CLEAR Outcomes’, is
specially testing even
longer-term safety and
whether this approach
reduces cardiovascular
disease in addition to
lowering cholesterol.”
