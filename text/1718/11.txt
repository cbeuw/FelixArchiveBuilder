Captain Marvel:Review
D
irected by
Anna Boden
and Ryan
Fleck, starring
Brie Larson, Samuel L.
Jackson and Jude Law,
Captain Marvel is the
first female-led super-
hero film produced by
Marvel Studios. Politics
and social agenda aside,
Captain Marvel is an
entertaining, though not
fully satisfying, chapter
of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe (MCU).
Kickstarted by Captain
America: Civil War
and to be concluded by
Avengers: Endgame
coming next month,
Phase 3 of the MCU
contains some of the best
films produced by Marvel
Studios, including the
hilarious Thor: Ragnarok,
the ruminative Black
Panther, and of course
the ultimate blockbuster
Avengers: Infinity War.
Standing among these
critical and commercial
giants, Captain Marvel,
a Phase 1-type superhero
origin film through and
through, manages to stand
on its own as a thoroughly
enjoyable Marvel flick.
The story of the film
is relatively generic and
straightforward, bar a few
surprises and told in a
rather strangely convolut-
ed way. There is also not
a huge amount of conflict
or tension - all in all; it is
not vastly different from
most other MCU origin
films. However, Marvel
Studios understands
that its strength lies in
its characters. Despite
flimsy plotting, with 120
minutes, this film has
made me grow attached
to the new hero, and I am
more than happy to see
her join the other MCU
flagship heroes such as
Iron Man and Captain
America.
Brie Larson’s depiction
of Carol Danvers was hard
to put into words. It is not
necessarily emotionless
or flat, rather, I think
I would use the word
“determined”. Without
putting a whole range of
facial movements on her
face, she successfully
conveyed the charisma
and strength that radiates
from within. Samuel L.
Jackson reprises his role
as Director Fury. His abso-
lutely fun and enthusiastic
performance, with truly
compelling de-aging CGI,
allows him to dominate
every scene he is in.
The chemistry between
the main cast, including
Goose the “cat”, carries
the blander moments in
the screenplay.
Unexpectedly, contrary
to many MCU origin
films, Captain Marvel
does not suffer from an
unenergetic and fatigued
second act – the time
between gaining powers,
and facing the final villain.
As a matter of fact, I find
Captain Marvel‘s second
act the most compelling
part of the story. Captain
Marvel’s discovery of her
own past and family is
the most emotional and
poignant part of the film.
And when the third act
arrives, along with the
cacophony of explosions
and punches, the film
actually becomes rather
dull.
Overall, with lovable
characters, dedicated
performances and a
killer post-credit sneak
peek, Captain Marvel is
a mid-tier MCU film that
serves as a sufficient, but
familiar, origin story for a
brand new hero.
Being John Malkovich
I
recently turned
twenty. After bat-
tling through the
bittersweet feelings
of aging, a newfound ex-
istential angst and a sud-
den realisation of one’s
mortality, I found it in
myself to truly cherish
this milestone and dis-
cover this treasure of a
film from the year I was
born.
Being John Malkovich
is exactly what it says on
the tin. An avid puppeteer,
Craig Schwartz (played
by John Cusack), stum-
bles upon a portal leading
directly into the mind and
body of Hollywood actor,
John Malkovich (played
by John Malkovich).
What follows is a queer
ride through the bizarre
back alleys of humanity
with enough surrealist
contrivance to whisk your
foresight of the plot into
stiff peaks. Top perfor-
mances are given by the
rest of the cast, including
an unrecognisable Camer-
on Diaz and the brilliant
Catherine Keener. It’s an
impressive debut from
director Spike Jonze and
writer Charlie Kaufman,
who would go on to make
many other greats such as
Her and Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.
This meta masterpiece
certainly seems to have
aged better than I. There
is a refreshingly proud
progressive narrative that
weaves its heavy-duty
themes of transfiguration
with absurdist humour.
Is it a comedy? Perhaps
in the Shakespearian
sense. The sweet streak of
sadness exists somewhere
between the Coen Broth-
ers and Terry Gilliam. It’s
an out-and-about feminist
movie that deserves more
recognition.
With the wackiness
aside, Being John Malk-
ovich is strangely poetic
and meditative. The
characters’ feelings of
frustration, self-loathing
and childish desires draw
parallel to the cusp of
adolescent anguish into
millennial adulthood that
the film would experience,
if indeed it was “born” in
the year 1999. So relax,
put your feet up and go
on this ethereal trip into
the mind and soul of John
Malkovich.
Available on Netflix
(and on BoB).
