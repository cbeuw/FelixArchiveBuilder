hursday 7th
March saw five
entrepreneurs
compete for a
share of a £30,000 prize
fund in the final of Im-
perial Enterprise Lab's
WE Innovate women's
entrepreneurship pro-
gramme.
The evening began
with brief addresses from
F
ake News has
made a bold
entrance into
the social
media sphere. The
term, commonly used
by Donald Trump, was
Is #fakenews damaging your health?
named 2017’s (ultimate)
‘Word of the Year’ by
Collins Dictionary. It’s
almost impossible to
ignore fake news across
social media and the
sensationalist headlines
have percolated into
healthcare. Of the most
widely shared health ar-
ticles published in 2018,
less than 50% were rated
highly credible and of the
top 10 shared articles, 7
contained misleading or
false information.
Despite no evidence
to suggest that the MMR
vaccination causes
autism, vaccination rates
have fallen in England
for the fourth year in
a row. Despite little
evidence-based benefit,
placenta pills have gained
popularity in the US and
are now gaining traction
in the UK. Despite no sci-
entific backing for much
of their advice, across the
pond Gwyneth Paltrow
has managed to maintain
a following for her natural
health company- goop.
With social media pro-
viding a global channel
for influence and social
media algorithms increas-
ing its spread, is fake news
affecting your health?
The answer is yes.
From health fads to
disease immunity, fake
news risks reversing the
work decades of medical
and scientific research.
There is already evidence
to suggest that people’s
trust in scientific infor-
mation is breaking down.
As the lack of regulation
around fake news and
paid product endorse-
ments continues, the risk
to people’s health in-
creases. If nothing else, it
places an already strained
healthcare service under
more pressure as people
reject evidence-based
guidelines for alternative
and celebrity endorsed
methods, many of which
can badly damage your
health.
This is not an issue
unique to medicine and
it’s on all of us to call
out fake news where we
see it. However, perhaps
more importantly, we also
need to lobby the govern-
ment to act. Social media
algorithms (Facebook’s
in particular) promote the
spread of fake news and
give it greater traction.
Without policies to protect
the public, the rejection of
scientific evidence will
only increase.
For action, we need
evidence. There is a range
of ongoing research into
social media platforms
and those who use them.
I’m part of a team of stu-
dents at Imperial who are
looking at how influencers
on social media change
their followers’ healthcare
decisions. We hope this
research will strengthen
the calls on the govern-
ment and give healthcare
providers clarity on the
public’s healthcare per-
spectives.

Liz Choonara, Head of
Programmes & Commu-
nity at the Imperial Enter-
prise Lab, and Professor
Maggie Dallman, Vice
President (International)
and Associate Provost
(Academic Partnerships),
who said: "It is wonderful
to see this community of
female student entrepre-
neurs grow".
Following these, the
five finalists took to
the stage to pitch their
proposals to the expert
panel of judges, including
Kate Bingham, Managing
Partner at SV Life Scienc-
es, Sir Patrick Vallance,
Government Chief Sci-
entific Advisor, Sandra
Eager, Ventures Principal
at BP Venutres, and Priya
Guha, Venture Partner at
Merian Ventures.
Suchaya Mahuttanatan,
an undergraduate Bio-
medical Sciences student,
won the top prize of
£15,000 for her invention,
Cadget.
Cadget, a "pioneering"
new kind of orthopaedic
cast that is breathable,
washable and easy to
apply, could "revolu-
tionise the bone healing
experience". Unlike
traditional orthopaedic
casts, which are usually
made from plaster or
fibreglass and tend to be
bulky, uncomfortable and
must be kept dry, Cadget
is made using a specially
engineered material that
can be activated to turn
from flexible to perma-
nently stiff in minuted.
Clinicians would simply
mould the material around
the injured limb and wait
for it to harden, meaning
it could be individually
moulded to each patient
before it stiffens, making
for a more comfortable
experience. Suchaya is
currently developing her
prototype and has already
lined up five hospitals in
Thailand in which to pilot
Cadget.
Numerous additional
prizes were also awarded
during the final, includ-
ing, for the first time, an
audience prize. Those in
attendance were asked
to vote for the winer of
the £5000 Lauren Dennis
Award. This prize was
awarded to Changavy
Kajamuhan, whose team
is developing Tommy,
a non-invasive weara-
ble device which uses
machine learning software
to accurately determine
glucose levels in people
with type 1 diabetes.
