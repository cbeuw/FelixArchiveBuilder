College leadership accused of colluding with UCLU
to interfere with Leadership Elections
HANGMAN
Officials are following
up on claims that the
Union Elections were
heavily influenced by
a rival student body.

Editor-in-Chief
T
he results of the
2019 Leadership
Elections have
come under
scrutiny, as allegations
of collusion between
senior College officials
and University College
London Union (UCLU)
officers to influence the
outcome were unsurfaced.
Numerous complaints
were filed with the Union
over the seven-day
campaign period, with
the overwhelming major-
ity complaining that their
eVoting menus refused
to show most of the can-
didates running for key
roles, such as Ethics &
Environmental Officer.
The fault was eventual-
ly traced to a USB dongle
planted in the Union
Office, which, upon in-
spection, was connected
wirelessly to the UCL
Euston campus.
It is believed the inter-
ference tipped the scales
in favour of the underdog,
Fergie Jackson, who won
an upset victory against
the favourite, RON.
When informed he had
won, Mr Jackson looked
notably perplexed. “Hold
on,” he said, “you mean
people actually voted
for me? Did you lot
undergraduate, was vocal
in his dissatisfaction.
“This is bullshit,” RON
remarked, “everyone
knows there’s no better
choice than RON! I
demand a recount!”.
Despite this, RON swept
up the majority of the
roles up for contention.
College’s CFO (Cam-
paign Fraud Oligarch)
Ruhr Xanderthon recently
visited UCL’s main
campus on a scheduled
‘business trip’, carrying
a bag stuffed with signed
tuition fee cheques. The
bag was later identified as
belonging to none other
than Janice Fast, College
Overseer, hinting that
the order came from the
highest echelons of the
College.
It is widely believed the
Mr Johnson’s ascencion to
the role would render the
Union unable to challenge
the College, enabling
Mr Xanderthon and Prof
Fast to mould the univer-
sity to their whims, and
invariably giving UCLU
more credence as the most
democractic Students’

Arch Bhantarsaurus,
Reprehensible to Council
(Natural Sciences), was
seen foaming at the mouth
outside the Union Build-
ing, and was heard to be
saying, “this wouldn’t
have happened with my
petition system!,” before
starting a riot to disregard
the vote.
This follows a particu-
larly testy campaigning
season, which saw the
Union suspend two
candidates for the role of
Deputy President (Elimi-
nation) for engaging in a
fight to the death in Metric
following ‘Meet the Can-
didates’, in an attempt to
prove their suitability for
the job.
“Did you lot
honestly think
I’d take this
job? I’ve got an
offer from J. P.
Morgan!”
honestly think I’d take
this job - I’ve got a offer
at J.P. Morgan! Keep
your measly £33,000; I’m
about to eat good from
here on out!”

corner and put them to the test.
Felix Editor
Prediction: Felix Cat
“As part of an effort
to make Felix more in-
clusive, I see Fergus will
install a cat as Editor. ‘Tis
written in the stars.
As well as providing
crucial insight on the best
places to nap on campus,
the Felix feline will also
allow for the recycling
of the newspaper as litter
lining. What a way to
enhance sustainability.
The editorials will
probably be better too.”
NegaFelix predicts: the Leadership Elections!
This week your flatmate
does some manscaping.
Unfortunately for you he
used your face towel -
you did wonder why your
beard was looking fuller..
This week Facebook,
Instagram and WhatsApp
all go down.
Probably overloaded from
all the damn campaign
posts.
This week you read
through the candidate
manifestos.
Who to blame for the
Union’s fuck-ups next
year?
Choose wisely.
This week you pull your
first all-nighter of the
year in the library.
You’ve missed the cold
feeling of PTSD.
This week you hear
another candidate talking
shit about your poster.
You up the ante and shit
on their posters.
The ultimate smear
campaign.
This week you
successfully get away
with cheating in the
Leadership Elections.
Big up DROs.
This week you find out
71% of young Brits say
porn has given them ideas
to try in the bedroom.
You’re currently looking
for a taxi.
This week you’re Alice
Gast. You can’t escape
Felix forever.
We have a particular
set of skills. We will
find you, and we will
interview you.
This week you vote in the
Leadership Elections.
When will this joke of
a popularity contest be
over?
This week your
housemate’s running for
Union President.
How she plans on
cleaning up the Union
when she can’t even clean
up the sink is beyond
you.
This week you’re
NegaFelix and you’ve
lost the ability to write
anything else about the
elections.
You just want them over
Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies)
Prediction: Maurice
Yap
“It was over once
he mentioned chicken
nuggets. Forget budg-
eting, this is the kind of
student support I expect
to see from my Officer
Trustees.
Plus, anyone who
describes themselves as
comfy to sit on deserves a
£30k salary.”
Deputy President
(Education)
Prediction: RON
“Given that this was an
uncontested role (no, one
person isn’t enough), this
seemed like the perfect
excuse to vote for RON.
He’s reliable, he’s
funny and most impor-
tantly, he understands the
Imperial undergraduate
experience. No, we don’t
care about postgrads.
That’s what you get if
you want to compromise
democracy.”
Deputy President
(Finance & Services)
Prediction: Rebecca
Elkington
“NegaFelix is very
excited to reveal that
Rebecca Elkington will
probably be the next in
a long line of ineffective
DPFSs. Congratulations,
you played yourself.
Honestly though, as
long as I get to siphon off
the Felix Editor’s income,
you have my vote.”
Deputy President
(Welfare)
Prediction: Yinlin Wang
“Given that he’s put
himself forward for at 3
different roles, NegaFelix
sees that this will be the
one he gets, as it’s the
most irrelevant.
NegaFelix expects him
to do his duty, which is to
say we expect a serious
mental breakdown within
3 months. We wish him
the best in his future
recovery.”
Union President
Prediction:
Fergus Johnson
“Who gives a shit that
you’ve spent 3 years on
C-WTF or on the Board
of Crusties. NO ONE.
I for one see that
University Challenge
crown as a certainty in
our future with Fergus as
our President. Plus, all the
other candidates would
have probably killed each
other by Results Night.
Really looking forward
to the slide, by the way.”
