Do we need Women’s Day?
A reflection on what Women’s Day and feminism means in today’s context

W
hy do we
need a day
to celebrate
women? In
truth if you think about the
concept of a day to cele-
brate women, it sounds
almost absurd, women are
so crucial to humankind
that a one-day celebration
doesn’t even come close
to acknowledging how
important women are.
That’s one way of seeing
it, and there’s also the
viewpoint that argues that
women are very well off
in the present day and
age, and that feminism is
unnecessary, and that an
International Women’s
Day is pointless.
So, what is Women’s
Day in any case? Do
women just gather
together and have
sleepovers and watch rom
coms? No, wrong, that’s
Valentine’s Day. The 8th
March is the day that
across the world women
and men gather to bring
attention to women’s
rights, and campaign for
equality. For us as privi-
leged first world citizens,
it may seem strange. What
more battles are there
left to fight for women’s
equality? We’ve seen
it all now, from female
suffrage, to female pres-
idents, CEO’s and scien-
tists. In fact, if feminism
has now boiled down to
if my nipple is censored
or not on Instagram,
then that either says that
indeed feminism has lost
its purpose, or that there’s
nothing more left to fight
for.
But I believe that there
is much more left to do.
I disagree that the main
struggle for women now
is deciding how little
clothes we get to wear,
and I have noticed that
the women that are most
passionate about this topic
are famous women whose
main source of income
relies on their body and
appearance. As such,
I wondered if perhaps
there’s a deeper meaning
to their protest that may
have gone unnoticed.
The common underlying
theme seems to be a re-
jection of the established
patriarchy’s standards of
what women should do
with themselves and their
bodies? That is certainly
something I agree with. I
have had the privilege of
growing up in a country
where deciding what I
wanted to study was not
an outrage, and where
being a less agreeable,
quiet and polite woman
was not a catastrophe.
Nonetheless, I have not
entirely escaped the daily
jabs that are part of being
a woman.
It is here in Imperial
where I have had my
abilities questioned the
most. It is mostly by male
counterparts that seemed
to think that they are
entitled to interrogate me
with an air of examination
to find out if I “actually
know what I’m talking
about”. How am I meant
to react to their patronis-
ing response when they
realise I do indeed know
what I’m doing? Am I
meant to be thankful,
despite the fact that they
just insinuated that they
didn’t believe I was smart
enough to be their equal?
Other examples include
being told to go ask
another (male) friend for
help, for the lack of belief
that I am capable enough
of doing my own projects.
Even the eyebrow raises
of surprise when other
(again male) individuals
are shocked that I’m
working on something
“cool” or “difficult”. As
though it is a surprise that
I could work on anything
mildly challenging.
Another serious issue
that a worryingly high
proportion of men in
Imperial have is the ina-
bility to speak to females
unless the motivation
is romantic. However, I
must say out of respect
to many other men that I
know, that it is unfair to
claim that all of them are
the same, because that’s
not factually correct and I
personally despise gener-
alisations.
These are just some in-
conveniences faced in the
daily life of many women
in similar situations to
mine, and whilst these are
not life changing and most
of us have developed the
subtle art of not giving
a fuck, it becomes more
worrying when you en-
counter situations in your
life where you fear for
your safety. Whether it be
being followed in a car by
strange looking men, to
repeated unwanted sexual
advances, almost every
anything in between. Take
this time to reflect on how
you can contribute to a
more equal world. It’s in
fact very simple. Be re-
spectful, treat the women
and men around you as
equal. If you are woman,
then question yourself,
are you doing something
for yourself or to adhere
to a standard that was set
by a patriarchal system?
If you are a man, question
yourself too. Are you
doing something for
yourself, or to prove your
masculinity? Sometimes
it is hard to tell the differ-
ence.
So back to my initial
question. Why DO we
need Women’s Day? The
answer is we don’t. The
concept of having one
day a year to remind us
to be respectful towards
all genders and to ensure
that all genders are equal
is dumb, because we
shouldn’t need this day
at all. The fact that we
have this is a clear sign
that we still have things
to change. As a feminist,
I will be happy when the
day comes when having
women’s day is absurd
because women and men
are indeed equal.
Until then, I will
celebrate what I consider
feminist icons. Independ-
ent working women,
single mums raising
families, mothers that
teach their sons respect
and not their daughters
to not go out at night
alone, fathers that call
their daughters intelligent
as opposed to beautiful
and all the women that
are silent revolutionaries,
breaking sexist rules one
at a time. And maybe one
day I’ll be less annoyed
about the free the nipple
hashtag being used as a
feminist slogan, although
the latter is very unlikely.
Women protesting in Madrid on the 8th March/ / Telemadrid
woman you speak to will
have some anecdote of
unfortunate happenings
like the ones previously
mentioned that they could
tell you about. Were I
to describe the ones that
have occurred to me and
to women I am close with,
this article would be a) too
long and b) too graphic to
publish. But please, if you
are a man reading this,
take 5 minutes of your day
and ask a female friend if
she would like to tell you
about any similar expe-
riences she might have
had. You’ll be surprised,
because the likelihood
is that anyone from your
sister to your mother will
have experienced some-
thing very similar.
But the purpose of
this article is not to rant
about the sexism I face
in my daily life because
the world doesn’t revolve
around me. The purpose
is for you, the reader,
to realise that you can
do something to change
this. It doesn’t matter if
you’re a woman, man or
