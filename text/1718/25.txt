S
ci{l}ence is a
weekly podcast for
women in STEM.
It gives women a
platformtotalkaboutwhat
it is really like working in
typically male-dominated
fields. All the guests are
highly accomplished
and inspiring women
in STEM, deliberately
kept anonymous with
disguised voices. This
allows them to enjoy the
freedom to speak openly
and honestly about their
personal journeys, and
minimises how others
could judge them by their
academic achievements,
what they look like and/
or any other ‘societal’
labels and badges. Felix
sat down with the host
of Sci{l}ence, Dr. Shini
Somara.
Could you describe to
me how the podcast
came to being. Firstly,
how long have you
been doing it?
Last weekend I released
episode 36. It came about
really because I studied
Mechanical Engineering
[at Brunel] myself and
there were very few
women on my course.
As a result of being at
university for almost
eight years because I did
my bachelors and then I
went on to do a doctorate,
I spent pretty much eight
years never really talking
about my experiences
in studying engineering.
When I got into televi-
sion, I was conducting
reports on a really diverse
range of science and tech
and innovation stories.
Often, when the cameras
would be turned off and
they were just being their
natural selves, we would
have really insightful
conversations about what
it’s like being a woman in
STEM. It really gave me
an insight into their world
as human beings rather
than scientists. It got me
thinking about how to
bring out this kind of truth
without compromising on
their identities and their
reputations, and that’s
how the podcast format
came about and then the
name just popped into
my head out of nowhere.
There’s so much power in
silence
What are the biggest
challenges that you’ve
faced in doing the
podcast?
The biggest challenges
have been finding women
who are willing to get
involved because ano-
nymity is something that
we really are not familiar
with in this day and age.
The ability to truly trust
anonymity on the podcast
makes women hesitate to
come on
Going forward, what
do you see as the
future of the podcast?
I’m hoping that it will
be a place where it will
inspire others. I’m hoping
that the podcast will be a
place where people can
justgetabitoftheabilityto
relate. I think also I would
like to change attitudes.
I actually would prefer it
if more men listened to
the podcast than women
because I think what’s dif-
ficult for women in STEM
is male attitudes towards
them being in STEM. I’d
love to have some kind of
impact, even if it’s a small
dent, on our perception
of stereotypes, cultural
and traditional values and
beliefs towards women
in STEM. I’d just like to
make a bit of a difference
in uniting men and women
in STEM because I think
there’s such a divide.
Do you think it’s
possible to affect
meaningful change
with regards to
attitudes towards
women in STEM if
men continue to
not engage with the
movement?
It’s a really tricky
question because, on the
one hand, a lot energy is
being put into encourag-
ing women. In order to do
that, I’ve seen that they
exclude men, just so that
they’ve got a safe space.
We need to change the way
we’re raising our men.
From young, we need to
develop a respect for what
women can bring to the
table. A massive change
is required. When we do
include them, we should
let women take the stage
and not be overshadowed
by what men can bring.
Either through the
podcast or through
personal experience,
what would you say
are the biggest issues
that are faced by
women in STEM?
I think the biggest
issues are self belief.
I think another one is
fighting the discrimination
and how much energy that
takes; women getting to a
point where they’re like,
“Why am I bothering?
I’m already in something
so hard and then I’ve got
to prove myself extra hard
because I’m a woman”.
There are so many issues
because there are so few
of us and that can be ad-
ditional pressure. There’s
a lot of challenges that
we face and it’s actually
really admirable how
much we take on board as
women in STEM. Of the
women that I have spoken
to, they just absolutely
love their job and so you
can see that satisfaction is
what keeps them going.
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
H
ey guys! I am Laura Chen, the 18-
19 International Officer. My role
is to represent the international
student body and to advocate for
cultural diversity at Imperial College.
Imperial is a truly global community with
64% of its students being non-UK students
and from all over the world. To engage
the students and to celebrate diversity
