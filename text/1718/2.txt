We've weathered the election
storm
T
onight's Lead-
ership Elections
Results Party
marks the end
of the election season.
We've made it through
the never-ending
campaigning, the fake
smiles and the Facebook
spamming. I'm proud of
us.
This week also marks
the final issue of Felix
for the term (sad reaccs
only!). You'd think, with
only eight issues left in
my tenure as Editor, I
would surely know how to
write an Editorial by now.
You'd be wrong. As per,
I'm just going to waffle
and run you through my
week until I've filled out
this page. Feel free to tap
out now.
Last Thursday I attend-
ed the WE Innovate Final,
to celebrate women's en-
trepreneurship. The event
was particularly special
for me because my friend
Lauren's memory was
honoured with a £5000
prize being awarded in her
name. Massive thank you
to Liz Choonara and Pro-
fessor Maggie Dallman
for such a fitting and
tasteful tribute. Lauren
always said she "didn't
want to be mourned, she
wanted to be remem-
bered" and I think we did
that. It was also the first
time I'd seen her parents
Tim and Lorraine since
the funeral in November
and we had a truly lovely
dinner afterwards. I've
been pretty happy since
my team overturned a 2-0
deficit in the Champions
League last Wednesday
and this just felt like icing
on the cake.
Speaking of Man
United, for most of the
year I've successfully
fought the urge to turn this
Editorial into a weekly
run down of my team's
performance. Mainly
because Mourinho left me
completely apathetic to
2
football until his sacking
in December. Also, I
thought I'd developed
more of a personality than
"the guy that always talks
about football". Guess I
was wrong... Our defeat to
Arsenal this weekend was
inevitable, all good things
must come to an end. We
had a good run anyway.
My birthday is coming
up next week (if you want
to get me a present, I'll
happily accept Hamilton
tickets), and anybody that
knows me well knows I
love nothing more than
going to concerts. It's no
coincidence that tonight
I'll be going to my third
show of the week, with 2
more scheduled for next
week. Anyway, I just
wanted to brag a bit to be
honest. Enjoy the Results
Party, I'm going to be
vibing to Anderson .Paak
in Ally Pally.
Finally, I wanted to
say a huge thank you to
everyone in the Felix
Fam! This term has
absolutely flown by and,
as I've said before, the
paper would be nothing
without you and your
contributions. Having
said that, I still have to
choose my Section of the
Week. Despite an interest-
ing double page from the
Comment section, Section
of the Week has to go to
my Music section for a be-
hemoth six page section.
Check out the review of
Dave's Psychodrama to
see my return to Music
writing. Massive shoutout
to Adrian LaMoury for
putting in a mega shift and
laying out four of the six
pages singlehandedly!
Anyway, I think I'm
going to leave it there.
Drink water, listen to
Dave's album and stay
smiling; see you all in
May!
