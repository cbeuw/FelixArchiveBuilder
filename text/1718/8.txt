Brexit: the end of internationalism

COMMENT

I
consider myself
many things: a global
citizen, a European
citizen and a British
citizen, in no particular
order. Their ideals have
always complimented
each other but for the first
time, they have started to
clash. The onset of Brexit,
as we rapidly approach
the 29th of March, has
thrown my whole identity
into crisis. My British
citizenship, which I have
proudly possessed for my
whole life up to this point,
now threatens the other
pillars on which I base
myself.
I was born in Notting-
ham. My parents met
at university due to an
Erasmus programme but,
after a few lovely years in
the UK, they took job op-
portunities in Geneva. We
enjoyed a nice life, living
in neighbouring France,
hopping across the border
every day for school
and work. For many, the
advantages of the EU
might be a little abstract;
I reaped the fruits of this
union everyday as my life
was sprawled across it.
With nothing but a British
passport to my name, I
still felt like I belonged in
this little corner of France.
I may have possessed a
British passport, and the
lady next door a French
one, but we were both
European equals. This
common identity was
comforting as beyond
having the right to live
here in France, I genuinely
felt like I belonged. None-
theless, after spending
all my formative years
learning the language and
culture, I still felt British
and not French.
I have no familial ties
to the UK. My allegiance
to this nation was due to
the values of tolerance and
openness that it stood for.
These values had allowed
my immigrant parents to
study and work, providing
them with a springboard
into a successful life.
When Brexit happened
on the 23rd of June, I
was in shock as nothing
would be the same again.
To think that my entire
existence could be ripped
up, with my precious
passport becoming blue
as my country was turning
its back on my beloved
EU. Those leading the
debate see this as a purely
political decision but for
millions of young citizens,
the European identity is in
their blood.
Ultimately, I believe
some aspects of Brexit
have been exaggerated. I
am sure my rights at home
in France and the rights of
1.3 million British citizens
living in the EU will be
guaranteed. There might
be a small recession and
then business as usual.
However, things will
never be the same again
as the message sent by
Brexit resonates in every
corner of the globe.
Britain has always been
an extremely multicultur-
al nation where all could
feel welcome. This might
not change overnight, but
leading up to the vote on
the 23rd of June 2016,
up until Brexit day on
the 29th of March and
beyond these ideals have
been and are continuing
to be eroded. This whole
ordeal has unleashed the
beast of xenophobia and
toxic nationalism and
normalized it for many.
Increasingly being tar-
nished by these cancerous
voices, it is natural that
international talent will
look elsewhere for oppor-
tunities. Students, who
came to Britain on a wave
of internationalism, like
my own parents, would
never dare under today’s
conditions. This prospect
horrifies me and so I no
longer wear the badge of
Britishness with pride, if
I could, I would no longer
wear it at all.
Imperial pays working student late, again
F
or the third time
in six months,
Imperial depart-
ments have failed
to pay students who work
for them on a part time
basis on time. Students
working on all day work-
shops around the pay date
were informally told that
they may have not be
paid on time, and that it

was their responsibility
to follow it up with upper
management. Imperial
Outreach, the department
responsible for science
communication and
outreach programs, was
largely affected, but have
yet to put out any official
information informing
students they may yet to
be paid and what to do
about it.
This comes at a bad
time for the Outreach
department, whom have
been struggling to recruit
more students to work
in the new Outreach
space on the new White
City Campus. Students
working for Outreach,
known as casual-pay
workers, often rely on
their wages to pay bills
and rent. One student,
who was owed over
£300 for work in January
and February, told Felix
that they had to rely on
their life savings to get
by that month. Students
were also payed late just
before Christmas, and in
October.
Imperial Outreach
departments run summer
schools for London sec-
ondary school students.
It relies on about 100
Imperial students each
summer. Both students
and staff were paid late
and the wrong amounts
in October, for work con-
ducted over the 3 summer
months. Some individ-
uals were missing over
£1,000, causing stress and
financial problems. With
rent and bills increasing
faster than student loans
in London, it is unaccept-
able for Imperial to pay
students and staff late.
