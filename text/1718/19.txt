W
hen a small
district at
the fringe
of a bigger
town becomes more and
more obscure, how do we
revive it? These are the
things that are occurring
more and more commonly
in the rural areas of Japan.
Various methods were
undertaken with varying
degrees of success, but
one remote village located
just east of the mid-size
city of Wakayama came
up with a brilliant idea
that would attract visitors
from all around the world
in numbers to this humble
little village. So what was
it that they did that was so
effective?
They decided to put
a stationmaster at the
terminus of the Kishigawa
line, and a very special
one indeed. Why? Well
for a start, she’s a cat.
It all started around
2004 when the informal
officer in charge of the
Kishi train station, the last
train stop served by the
fading Kishigawa line in
the Wakayama prefecture,
adopted a stray named
Tama and made her a
local star. Since then,
Tama had been garnering
attention and eventually
helped locals convince
the council to overturn the
decision to close down the
line.
The tourism boost gen-
erated by the introduction
of this feline friend only
grew bigger and not long
after, Tama was adorned
with gifts and honours
for her contribution to
the local society. Taking
advantage of Tama’s
fame, the Kishigawa line
improved its train services
as well and as of today, the
electric-powered trains
running along this route
now has 4 different quirky
designs, where one of
them, the Tama Densha, is
dedicated to Tama herself
and contains a whopping
101 Tamas drawn on the
body of the train.
Unfortunately, Tama
passed away in 2015,
passing the baton of her
legacy to her understudy,
Nitama, or “Tama the
Second”, to continue
carrying out ‘super’ sta-
tionmaster duties. Tama
can rest assured that the
station is in safe paws,
for Nitama is not without
experience in this kind of
work, as she had already
served as the stationmaster
of another small station,
the Idakiso station, which
is 5 stops away from Kishi
station on the same Kishi-
gawa line. Unlike Tama
who has short coat length
and a rather dashing look,
Nitama is more on the
fluffy side and exudes
elegance, as shown in
their respective adorable
cartoon depictions.
Most days, you would
usually find Nitama
dozing off in her spacious
box, rarely bothered
by the flock of tourists
admiring her. You don’t
need to worry about her
wellbeing though as all
she’s required to do is
nap most of the time, like
normal domesticated cats
do, and every so often
throughout the day, she
would get a well-deserved
fur brush and a tummy
rub by the station officer
who is also in charge of
the merchandise shop. On
top of that, she is only in
attendance at the station
5 days a week, while
her apprentice Yontama
takes over her workload
as stationmaster at Kishi
station on the other 2
days. Yontama also took
over Nitama’s previous
workpost when Tama
was still alive, and it’s
safe to say that when the
time comes, Yontama will
be promoted to Super
Stationmaster in Kishi
station.
While there isn’t much
action in the quaint town
of Kishi, the presence of
the calico snoozing in her
comfy box and the abun-
dance of Tama-related
merchandise goods found
in the nearby souvenir
shop that accompanies
her are enough to make
cat lovers all around the
globe travel all the way to
this remote village to get
a glimpse of the celebrity
cat. The locals, on the
other hand, mostly don’t
mind the visitors coming
in and out of the village.
In fact, they’re thankful
that this phenomenon that
is unique to Japan, nick-
named the Nekonomics
(the economics of cats),
has helped them revive
the dying train line that
goes deep into the coun-
tryside.
