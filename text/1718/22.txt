A
fter reviewing
Naked Dough
last month,
when we got
the chance to try out
another cookie dough
place, My Cookie Dough,
the excitement was real.
Although both serve
cookie dough, this place
adds a completely differ-
ent twist onto what we
thought we were expect-
ing, replacing raw cookie
dough with baked cookies
and soothing ice cream.
Did it live up to the hype?
Read on to find out!
The stall at Westfield
did not disappoint - with a
cute cloud-themed stand,
with colourful seats and
even cloud shaped tables
to balance your cookie
on while trying to snap
that perfect photo. The
smell of cookies in the
oven wafted in the air, and
the staff were extremely
friendly and helpful in
helping us choose what to
order(seriously,thechoice
is massive!). However,
the most interesting bit
was how cookie dough
is served. Here, the raw
cookie dough is freshly
baked right before your
eyes - but only enough to
make the outside crispy
and the inside soft and
gooey. All cookies are
also served with a dollop
of soft serve - surprisingly
good at making the incred-
ibly sweet cookies more
refreshing and delicious.
The choice of flavours was
simply amazing, and they
also offer cookie dough
shakes, a twist on your
”This place
adds a
completely
different
twist to what
we were
expecting”
classic milkshake. With
regards to the flavours we
tried:
Lotus Biscoff
Julia says: Having
fallen in love with Lotus
cookie dough in the past,
I was extremely excited
about this. This flavour
certainly lived up to the
Biscoff hype (did you
know they now have
Lotus Biscoff ice cream
sold in the UK?), with not
only a deliciously warm
Lotus cookie, but also
a rich creamy topping,
which paired with the soft
serve was a match made
in heaven.
Eva says: Lotus biscuits
have always been my
favourite so I had high ex-
pectations for this cookie
dough, and My Cookie
Dough took those expec-
tations and completely
surpassed them all. The
flavours were delicately
balanced, and the ice
cream on the side helped
neutralise the sweetness
and made for an overall
amazing experience.

Red Velvet
Eva says: This was not
the one for me, unfortu-
nately. I felt very over-
whelmed with the amount
of sugar in the dough
and didn’t really taste of
anything in particular.
The presentation was
wonderful, though, and it
looked very interesting,
but unfortunately the taste
didn’t match the looks.
Julia says: Red
velvet has always been a
mystery to me. Why does
red dough taste different
to normal dough when
all that differs is the
colouring? Unfortunately,
although ideal if you’re
craving sugar, that’s all
this tasted like - sugar,
topped with more sugar
(diabetes is an understate-
ment). Nevertheless, this
is definitely the most in-
teresting flavour we tried,
so props for that!
Rating: 2.5/5
Cinnamon Bun
Julia says: I love
cinnamon in any shape
or form, from savoury
dishes to baked goods,
so the prospect of having
a cinnamon cookie was
great. A cool twist was
the cookie - instead of
the typical plain cookie
dough you’d expect, it
was actually made of
the scrumptious Lotus
Biscoff dough - aka 2 of
my favourite things in one
- #win! The frosting was
a little sweet, but when
melted with the ice cream
was completely edible.
Eva says: This was
hands-down one of my
all-time favourite cookie
dough flavours. Anything
with cinnamon just feels
like a warm hug on a
cold winter’s day, and
this cookie dough was
no exception. If your
go-to cookie dough is
Biscoff, then you’re in for
a treat - with cinnamon
on top. The frosting was
a fantastic addition for
me (and everyone else
whose favourite part of
a cinnamon bun is the
frosting mmm…)

The Slutty Brownie
Eva says: This was a
lovely palette-cleanser
and made me feel all
types of things. With
oreos sprinkled all over
the cookie dough, there
was a nice crunch to it and
the melted Nutella on the
top was to-die-for. Who
would’ve thought you
could get so much choco-
late goodness in one stack
of cookie dough? Got a
sugar craving? Chocolate
craving? Cookie craving?
This stack will sort you
out like no other!
Julia says: After trying
so many cookies, it was
time for a stack, so obvi-
ously, we went for their
bestseller, a chocolaty
mix of a triple chocolate
cookie stacked onto a milk
chocolate cookie,with
crushed Oreos, and coated
with a generous portion
of melted Nutella. Sounds
like a sugar coma? You’d
be absolutely right, but a
delicious one at that.

S’Mores
Julia says: Last, but
definitely not least. This
gooey and rich Lotus
biscoff, chocolate, and
marshmallow melt was
certainly my favourite of
all the flavours we tried.
Not only did it satisfy
my love for Biscoff (it is
stroooong guys), but the
chocolate cookie toned
down the sweetness, and
the marshmallow was the
perfect quirky addition.
The ice cream wasn’t
even necessary, but made
the delicious experience
even better.
Eva says: Though I’m
not normally a lover of
all-things-chocolate, this
flavour was exceptional.
The marshmallows were
my favourite bit, and
gave the dough a different
texture that completely
bamboozled our taste
buds - we were so here
for it. This was one of My
Cookie Dough’s “stacks”,
which meant you got dif-
ferent doughs to try, with
only one order! It satisfies
all your cravings but make
sure you go on an empty
stomach because it’s a big
one!
Rating: 5/5
My Cookie Dough has
exceeded our expecta-
tions and satisfied all our
cravings,leavingusinabit
of a food coma afterwards
that was 100% worth it.
With most of their doughs
priced at a reasonable
£5-10, grabbing a yummy
dessert doesn’t need to
break the bank. They are
also working on exciting
projects, one of which
is developing some new
vegan flavours, which is
great for the environment
and can make it so much
easier for those that want
to make the transition
into being vegan but are
struggling with missing
the variety of flavours
available. They’re also on
Deliveroo so no excuses
now!
