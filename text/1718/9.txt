Explaining the Future book launched at UCL
“Technical
people are
both busy and
smart. I didn’t
need to labour
the point, and
so kept the
book at under
200 pages”
O
n Monday
March 4th,
Dr. Sunny
Bains from
the Department of
Biochemical Engineering
launched her new book
Explaining the Future:
How to Research, Analyze
and Report on Emerging
Technologies, published
by Oxford University
Press. The book – written
for engineers, physical
scientists, consultants,
and investors – focuses
on the how to determine
and communicate the
impact of new processes,
systems, and devices.
The event itself was
attended by more than
70 people from across
London and the South
East, including UCL staff
and students, working
engineers and consult-
ants, tech journalists and
editors, and academics
from other universities.
According to Bains,
one of the reasons she
wrote the book was
because she couldn’t find
one to assign her students.
Bains remarked, “there
were lots of books writing
reports on communication
and a few on research,”
she explained, “but I
couldn’t find anything on
how to figure out whether
or not a technology was
vapourware. By putting
all three of these elements
together in one short book,
I realized I could make a
real contribution.”
The book starts with a
chapter on the questions
to answer when thinking
about whether a new tech-
nologyislikelytosucceed,
followed by chapters on
various different types
of sources – from online
journals to conferences to
press releases – and how
trustworthy they are likely
to be. Chapter 4 focuses
on analysis and provides
a step-by-step process
for working through
applications and potential
solutions.
The focus then shifts to
communication, thinking
through the audience, its
motivation, and the level
of explanation needed.
In Chapter 6, Bains
works through the tech-
nical argument, a simple
formula that can be used
for almost any applied
science or engineering
development, as well as
other layers of structure
like introductions and
conclusions. The last
chapter explains how to
retain the audience’s trust
by providing the right kind
of evidence and signposts.
There is also a case
study (related to neuro-
morphic engineering and
machine intelligence)
where Bains works
through all the elements
covered in the formal
chapters of the book. She
explains in detail how she
approached the research
process and then includes
a final write-up at the end.
“It sounds like a lot,”
says Bains, “but I recog-
nise that technical people
are both busy and smart.
That meant I could say
what I needed to without
labouring the point, and
so to keep the book to
under 200 pages.”
Bains is a Principal
Teaching Fellow and
teaches hundreds of
students across various
engineering departments,
chemistry, natural
sciences, and BaSc.
In particular, she has
modules on Technical
Journalism for students
at all levels, where she
teaches all of the skills
covered in the book.
Bains worked as a tech
journalist for more than
two years herself, writing
for publications including
The Economist, Science,
Wired, EE Times, Laser
Focus World, and many
others.
According to Bains,
she has learned a huge
amount from teaching,
“Knowing how to do
something is one thing,
but knowing how to teach
it is something else. It’s
taken me a long time to
be able to incorporate
all of the questions and
feedback I’ve had from
students over the years so
that I can explain how to
communicate in a simple
and transparent way. I
couldn’t have written this
book without them.”
As well as teaching,
Bains is the Editorial
Director of Engineering
Inspiration, a mostly-cu-
rated website that brings
together the best technical
news from around the web
and tags it so that users
can find what they’re
looking for and customize
it to their interests.

Dinosaurs were thriving before asteroid strike that
wiped them out
SCIENCE
Henry Alman
Science Editor
A
new analysis
has posited that
dinosaurs were
unaffected by
long-term climate changes
and flourished before their
sudden demise by asteroid
strike.
Scientists largely agree
that an asteroid impact,
possibly coupled with
intense volcanic activity,
wiped out the dinosaurs at
the end of the Cretaceous
period 66 million years
ago.
However, there is
debate about whether di-
nosaurs were flourishing
before this, or whether
they had been in decline
due to long-term changes
in climate over millions of
years.
Previously, researchers
used the fossil record
and some mathematical
predictions to suggest di-
nosaurs may have already
been in decline, with the
number and diversity of
species falling before the
asteroid impact.
Now, in a new analysis
that models the changing
environment and dinosaur
species distribution
in North America, re-
searchers from Imperial
College London, Uni-
versity College London
and University of Bristol
have shown that dinosaurs
were likely not in decline
before the meteorite.
Lead researcher Ales-
sandro Chiarenza, a PhD
student in the Department
of Earth Science and Engi-
neering at Imperial, said:
“Dinosaurs were likely
not doomed to extinction
until the end of the Creta-
ceous, when the asteroid
hit, declaring the end of
their reign and leaving
the planet to animals like
mammals, lizards and a
minor group of surviving
dinosaurs: birds.
“The results of our
study suggest that dino-
saurs as a whole were ad-
aptable animals, capable
of coping with the envi-
ronmental changes and
climatic fluctuations that
happened during the last
few million years of the
Late Cretaceous. Climate
change over prolonged
time scales did not cause
a long-term decline of
dinosaurs through the last
stages of this period.”
The study, published in
Nature Communications,
shows how the changing
conditions for fossilisation
means previous analyses
have underestimated the
number of species at the
end of the Cretaceous.
The team focused
their study on North
America, where many
Late Cretaceous dinosaurs
are preserved, such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and
Triceratops. During this
period, the continent was
split in two by a large
inland sea. In the western
half there was a steady
supply of sediment from
the newly forming Rocky
Mountains, which created
perfect conditions for
fossilising dinosaurs once
they died. The eastern
half of the continent was
instead characterised by
conditions far less suitable
for fossilisation.
This means that far
more dinosaur fossils
are found in the western
half, and it is this fossil
record that is often used to
suggest dinosaurs were in
decline for the few million
years before the asteroid
strike.
Co-author Dr. Philip
Mannion, from University
College London, com-
mented: “Most of what
we know about Late Cre-
taceous North American
dinosaurs comes from an
area smaller than one-
third of the present-day
continent, and yet we
know that dinosaurs
roamed all across North
America, from Alaska to
New Jersey and down to
Mexico.”
Instead of using this
known record exclusively,
the team employed ‘eco-
logical niche modelling’.
This approach models
which environmental
conditions, such as tem-
perature and rainfall, each
species needs to survive.
The team then mapped
where these conditions
would occur both across
the continent and over
time. This allowed them
to create a picture of
where groups of dinosaur
species could survive as
conditions changed, rather
than just where their
fossils had been found.
The team found
habitats that could support
a range of dinosaur groups
were actually more wide-
spread at the end of the
Cretaceous, but that these
were in areas less likely to
preserve fossils.
Furthermore, these
potentially dinosaur-rich
areas were smaller
wherever they occurred,
again reducing the like-
lihood of finding a fossil
from each of these areas.
This, the researchers
claim, is what initially led
to the misinterpretation
that dinosaurs were on the
decline.

New hepatitis C cases down by almost 70% in HIV
positive men in London
SCIENCE
Henry Alman
Science Editor
N
ew cases of
hepatitis C
amongst HIV
positive men
in London have fallen
by nearly 70 per cent in
recent years. The new
analysis of data from three
clinics in London found
256 men were diagnosed
between 2013-2018. New
infections peaked at 17 for
every 1000 people studied
in 2015 and fell to six by
2018.
The researchers
behind the study, from
the Imperial College
Academic Health Science
Centre, believe that
regular screening and
improved access to new
treatments have contrib-
uted to greatly reducing
the transmission of the in-
fection. They also believe
that if this progress can be
maintained London will
be on track to achieve
the targets set out by the
British HIV Association
to eliminate Hepatitis C in
HIV patients by 2021.
The results were pre-
sented at The Conference
on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections,
a major HIV conference
in Seattle, on Wednesday
6 March.
Professor Graham
Cooke, NIHR Professor
of Infectious Diseases at
Imperial College London
and co-author of the
paper, said:
“The results from our
study should give us great
encouragement as we try
to eliminate hepatitis C.
There is a risk that these
gains might be reversed if
we can’t retreat patients
and we hope that soon this
might be possible through
NHS services.”
People with HIV who
get hepatitis C are more
at risk of the disease
progressing and they have
a higher risk of cirrhosis
and liver cancer. Hepatitis
C is the leading cause of
serious illness and death
in people who are HIV/
hepatitis C co-infected,
attributing to six percent
of all deaths.
Despite this, under
current guidelines those
recently infected with
hepatitis C have to wait
six months before they
can access DAA treatment
– a recently-developed
treatment which is highly
effective in 90% of
patients. Also, if a patient
is reinfected with hepatitis
C they are not eligible for
a second course of DAA,
potentially increasing the
risk of transmission.
The researchers suggest
that more screening,
wider prescribing of hep-
atitis C therapies such as
DAA tablets, and earlier
treatment of acute cases
have led to a decline in
acute hepatitis C cases.
However, the reduction
of cases still falls short
of the World Health Or-
ganisation’s target of 90
per cent and reinfections
remain high. The team
believe that there is an
on-going need to promote
risk reduction and design
appropriate screening
policies for HIV positive
men.
The team is expanding
the study network to other
centres with the ambition
of collecting data nation-
ally.
“Hepatitis C
is the leading
cause of death
in people
who are HIV/
hepatitis C co-
infected”
“Dinosaurs as
a whole were
adaptable
animals,
capable of
coping with
environmental
changes and
climactic
fluctuations”
