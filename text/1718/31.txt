Surprise success for Imperial at the Teddy Hall Relays

n the aftermath of
the successful 2019
edition of ICXCAC’s
Hyde Park Relays,
a merry band of Imperial
runners headed out to
Oxford for the ‘away’
fixture: Oxford’s Teddy
Halls Relays. With run-
ners wearily boarding
the convenient Oxford
Tube at Notting Hill or
Shepherd’s Bush, the
banter slowly ramped
up with Union and Club
politics dominating con-
versation. In between the
predictions and political
maneuvering, the Imperial
teams were boshed out
tactically for optimal
overall performance (this
would later be proved to
be a wise choice).
As the avid competitors
approached the famous
Roger Bannister track
(location of the first ever
mile under 4 minutes), the
weather started to look a
bit British.
The wind was whipping
up and some spray was
beginning to dampen the
confident mood of the
runners. Yet as the race
started, the girthy support
from ICXCAC’s travel-
ling fans left nothing to
be desired in the way of
belly-fire raising encour-
agement.
Former Club Chair,
Alex Mundell, started the
Mixed A team off with a
bang, with a run just shy
of the top men starting for
other mixed teams.
The momentum con-
tinued with star runner
Georgia Curry running the
3rd fastest female 7km leg
of the day.
As the baton was
handed to Ollie Newton,
Oxford’s Mixed A had a
reasonable lead but had
used a male runner on
their second leg.
Ollie smashed out a
fantastic leg - even if he
wasn’t completely happy
with it - to put Imperial
in the lead by just over
a minute as the baton
was handed over to Niki
Faulkner who would give
everything to hold off
Oxford’s sub-15-for-5k
man on the last leg.
As it happened, he
had a massive leg and
won Imperial the overall
mixed competition by 24
seconds.
In the Men’s competi-
tion, Club Chair Fergus
Johnson, James Millet,
Misi Ormay and Henry
Hart all ran solid times to
come second in the overall
competition, tactically
over 6 minutes behind
Oxford A and just seconds
ahead of Oxford B.
The Imperial Women
put in a valiant perfor-
mance to finish 16th ahead
of teams like Oxford
Brookes and Abingdon
AC A teams.
Particularly of note
was Treasurer Nathalie
Podder’s successful
completion of 7k having
recently graduated from
Women’s Captain Char-
lotte Barratt’s Couch-to-
5k program.
After the race, the
runners descended on
Teddy Hall’s canteen for
some dubious sandwiches
and the awards ceremony.
Inevitably, this led on to
a post-race Oxford spoons
(fork handles?) and night
out were well attended
with plenty of colourful
beverages and dubious
rumours of sightings of
the notorious Wealdstone
Raider.
The club’s beloved
megaphone was also lost
to a bush after it transpired
loudspeakers were not
permitted in club’s. Ah
well, it had a good run.
Cross Country & Athletics bring home more silverware - this time from Oxford.
