Kicking Up a Fuss Over Them/Us
A
s the curtain
rises and faces
stare with
anticipation,
for the last time until you
exit stage, you feel your
heart beat through your
chest. Countless hours
have gone into training,
learning, creating, per-
fecting, and bonding with
others on stage. I am, of
course, referring to how
I felt back when I used to
dance. If that’s how I felt
whendancing as a hobby,
I can only imagine how
it must’ve felt for the six
men I saw on stage last
Wednesday night.
Created by the dancers
of the company Ballet-
Boyz, the pressure for
Them/Us was definitely
on as the reigns had been
handed over from the
founders Michael Nunn
and William Trevitt. The
show was split into two
parts: “Them” and “Us”.
The first act “Them”
was choregraphed solely
by the dancers of the
company and was done
so simultaneously with
the score composition,
by Charlotte Harding.
You can see clearly from
the choreography that it
was created by the people
performing it. The motifs
amplify the incredible
strength and fluidity of the
performer’s movement
ability, and flow beauti-
fully together like a well-
oiled machine that created
itself.
The movement was
fabulously controlled and
never reached a fever pitch
(I’d describe it as “dialled
up to nine”). There were
no great leaps, falls or
lifts. Instead, the majority
of the half hour run time
was filled with large, bold
movements that stretched
the performers bodies, or
close contact work that
made it seem as though
the dancers shared one
mind. While I could not
see any incredible inno-
vation or presentation of
flare, the show excels in
presenting performers
in complete harmony.
The choreography was
made by all members in a
continuous collaborative
way, the final product is
a demonstration of their
collaborative power.
like the choreography,
felt natural and weaved
into the performance
effortlessly. Her minimal
use of instruments helped
achieve the seamless
combination of sight and
sound. With few string
instruments and the
simplest percussion, her
composition managed
to match the unbroken
energy of the dancers.
In a very Imperialesque
moment, the sound of
Harding’s composition
caused me to imagine the
dancer’s fibres of skeletal
muscle as the strings of
the cello I was hearing.
Now I’ve managed to
go this long without men-
tioning the elephant in the
room, or more accurately,
the giant cuboid frame on
the stage. This was my fa-
vourite part of the show as
it led to some incredibly
interesting use of levels
and space. As a frame it
allowed the performers to
move in and out, treating
the space differently in
relation to one another
and even going as far as
to impact the demeanour
of individual performers.
Alternatively, as a trans-
parent cuboid it produced
a kind of negative space in
the stage where you could
see through, but it felt as
though you shouldn’t have
been able to. I do think it
could’ve been used more
extensively and in differ-
ent creative ways, but I
must remind myself that
it’s a ballet not a circus.
The frame also led to my
favourite moment in the
entire show, hands down.
As Harding’s score cre-
scendos and the dancers
begin to take form, a
sudden change in lighting
leads to a stunning silhou-
ette. I couldn’t help but let
out a small “wow” under
my breath.
was originally a duet
choreographed by Chris-
topher Wheeldon for
BalletBoyz. The company
asked Wheeldon to come
back and provide the
story to what happened
before the duet. It is a
fantastic piece of chore-
ography, ending with the
phenomenal duet which is
one of the most sensitive
and compelling I have
seen for a while. I will say
no more about the second
half because I don’t want
to spoil all aspects of the
show and also because
I feel way more out of
my comfort zone talking
about Wheeldon’s chore-
ography.
Them/Us is certainly
not going to become an
infamous, long-lasting
ballet. However, it is an
utter joy to watch such
talented people create
something purely from
themselves and their
friendship. I only wish
that I could ever be part
of such a show and join
them(/us).
Twenty years on since the conception of the company, BalletBoyz are still producing fantastic works of modern
contemporary ballet.

If it weren’t for spoilers,
I’d go on for another page
about all the moments I
loved in that first half.
The second half “Us”
The beauty behind the monster of Frankenstein
F
rankenstein has
long borne the
false title of a
frightening and
twisted tale. However,
the focus of this story is
really on the loneliness of
Frankenstein’s Creature,
and its cravings for the
affections of his master.
Upon the loss of his
motherinchild-birth,Victor
Frankenstein succumbs to a
deep and consuming grief.
He embarks on medical
school and is introduced
to the idea of reanimation.
With the hope of a family
reunited and more than a
hint of madness, Franken-
stein stitches together and
awakens the Creature. Yet
Frankenstein only feels fear
upon sight of his creation
and chooses to reject this
lost and innocent being.
The sorrow of the Creature
quickly turns to thoughts of
anger and revenge and this
leads to a series of harrow-
ing tragedies. Despite it all,
the Creature continues to
desire the companionship
of Frankenstein and shows
us as an audience that the
most primal desire is that
of love.
Liam Scarlett’s ballet
is true to the moving
narrative of the original
novel but also striking in its
own right. Every aspect of
delivery was polished and
stunning, with the score
of Lowell Liebermann
performed flawlessly on
the night by the resident
Orchestra of the Royal
Opera House. The fluid
tones blended seamlessly
with the dancers, elevating
the emotion through tense
crescendo and compliment-
ing the romance between
Victor and his wife, Eliza-
beth, with soft melodies.
The dancers them-
selves were artful in their
movement. The Principal,
Victor Frankenstein, was
portrayed by Federico
Bonelli; William Bracewell
debuted as the Creature;
Laura Morera shone as
Elizabeth.
A particular strength
of this performance was
the contrast between the
characters and the manner
this was conveyed through
dance. Bonelli carried off
strong and unhesitating
leaps and lifts throughout,
telling of Frankenstein’s
seriousness and drive.
Bracewell was a true and
particular joy to behold.
He was elegant in a manner
almost feminine and the
hope and longing of the
Creature was palpable.
There were also occasions
of self-loathing and fast,
flighty movement that
captured these spates of
overwhelming emotion.
This is not to forget Morera,
who radiated beauty
and joy. Her character is
instrumental to bringing
happiness and light to the
story and to Frankenstein,
who is plagued by fear of
retribution and other night-
mares.
Another impressive
aspect of this ballet is its
design - every element
of it. The scene when
Frankenstein first enters the
surgical theatre is one of the
most powerful moments in
its staging. The lighting by
Finn Ross draws out deep
shadows, producing an
eerie and serious atmos-
phere initially. This is also
the location of the machine
that animates the Creature.
The large, heavily lit
operation table that lowers
to centre stage only exacer-
bates the drama of this.
However, all prior
scenes pale in comparison
to the masterpiece that is
the final act of Franken-
stein. Gorgeous staging
of a curling staircase and
sweeping lights set the
backdrop to the twinkling
gowns of the Royal Ballet
dancers. The soft beauty of
How Eva von Schnippisch won WWII
W
ho is
Eva von
Schnippisch
and what
does she have to do with
WWII? You might be
forgiven for wondering if
you’d fallen asleep one
too many times in history
class, but Stephanie
Ware’s one-woman caba-
ret has very, very little to
do with the actual affairs
of WWII at all.
It’s an unashamedly sala-
cious, nonsensical and hilari-
ous tale of how a certain Eva
von Schnippisch, a cabaret
performer in Weimar Ger-
many, gets recruited by the
British Secret Service and
ends up working her way
to the very top of the Nazi
Party. On the way, she goes
on missions in France and
Russia (cue comically bad
French and Russian stereo-
types). Sex inevitably saves
the day! In France, she is
working with the French
resistance when their head-
quarters are raided. I’ll leave
you to guess where she hid
their smuggled radio, but it
leads to music issuing from
her nether regions… a great
distraction while they grab
the hapless German soldier
and do unspeakable things to
his body with a pair of curl-
ing tongs. In Russia, she falls
in love with her target, the
Russian colonel ‘Vladimir’,
but alas – his very strange
sexual fetish leads to her dis-
covering the secret code tat-
tooed on his body (in a very
strange place) and she must
leave to fulfil her duties. She
is the best spy of the British
intelligence, after all.
Nothing is taken too seri-
ously here. As with any good
cabaret, the aim is to shock,
titillate and scandalise. Or-
gasms on stage! Blowjobs!
Thongs! Hitler’s bunker re-
imagined as a sex dungeon!
It could have been incredi-
bly weird, but Ware pulls it
off with aplomb. She has a
great sense of audience and
really knows how to play a
crowd. Before we know it,
we’re chanting ‘Ja, Eva, ja!’
and making airplane noises
at her request. And she keeps
it up even while she’s chang-
ing costumes – military hats,
French berets, feather boas
and Bavarian Lederhosen all
make an appearance.
The quick-fire narrative is
interrupted from time to time
by comedic musical num-
bers, which Ware belts out
in her surprisingly powerful
singing voice. As for stag-
ing, it’s pared-down but per-
fectly timed. Simple back-
drops, cabaret-style music
and quick lighting changes.
Who needs stage accessories
when we have Eva? For a
one-woman show, she cer-
tainly fills the stage. The 90
minutes whiz by as she takes
us through her hurly-burly
adventures, climaxing (pun
not intended) in a love affair
with Eva Braun that ends
with her killing Hitler and,
thus, winning WWII. A ri-
diculous, but ridiculously
funny, evening.
