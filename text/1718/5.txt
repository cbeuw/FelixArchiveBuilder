Mayhem in the Commons
This week has seen Theresa May’s waning authority drain away even further as we slide
towards ever greater chaos.

A
fter significant
p r e s s u r e ,
Theresa May
agreed to a
series of votes this week
to test the opinion of the
House of Commons on
Brexit. On Tuesday she
put her deal to another
vote after getting further
minor concessions from
the EU and still lost by
149 votes. This was a
humiliating defeat. After
slaving away all week-
end, it was the attorney
general, the government’s
top legal officer, who was
her undoing. After tweaks
to the Irish backstop, he
was still unable to say
that the backstop could
be left unilaterally by the
UK. This was ultimately
unacceptable to the DUP
and Brexiteers in her party
who killed the deal.
but stated further that it
was still the legal default
position which could
clearly be interpreted as
a way of trying to leave
no deal on the table. The
Prime Minister has used
the threat of no deal to
try and get remainers to
support her deal at the
risk of falling off a cliff
if they don’t. Due to
this sting in the tail, an
amendment was tabled
to the Prime Minister’s
motion to remove this
last part to reinforce
that the Commons
rejects no deal in all
scenarios. Even though
the PM commanded the
Conservatives to vote
against the amendment,
it passed by a majority
of a miserly 2 due to a
rebellion by some Con-
servative MPs. This is
when chaos descended.
At the beginning of the
day, the government
announced the PM’s
motion would be a free
vote because of the
obvious gaping chasm
between those at the
top of her government
who think no deal would
be catastrophic, and
those who think it’s a
necessary bargaining
chip to be used with the
EU. However, due to the
successful amendment,
the government told
its MPs to vote down
its own motion. There
were several senior
ministers who, rather
than vote against their
conscience to remove
no deal, decided to
abstain on the motion.
In ordinary times, this
would mean that they
would be sacked imme-
diately due to collective
responsibility. Collec-
tive responsibility is the
idea that in government,
all ministers agree to
always take the govern-
ment line on any policy
or vote in return for their
position as a minister
to dictate policy. With
these abstentions this
rejection of “no deal”
was approved by the
Commons. Whilst this
motion has no legal
force and the UK could
still leave the EU on
the 29th March without
a deal, it is becoming
increasingly unlikely
as it would require bad
faith on the side of the
government and the EU.
This vote was a clear
sign of the PM’s power
slipping away further as
she can’t even control
her senior minister, let
alone command a clear
majority in the House of
Commons. Her author-
ity has been shot and it
is hard to see how she
can govern much further
with the total loss of dis-
cipline now within her
own government. The
only quality Theresa
May appears to have as
a leader is her belliger-
ence, and she will carry
on until she is removed,
and she has now decided
the best course of action
is to try and get her vote
through for a third time.
She got her margin of
defeat down from 230 to
149 between the last two
as he poked and annoyed
people into submission.
In my opinion,
Theresa May’s Brexit
deal isn’t that bad, all it
does is set out the terms
for us leaving the EU and
very little, if anything,
has actually been
decided about our future
trading arrangements
with the EU. The Irish
backstop is a necessary
mechanism to avoid a
hard border between
the north and south of
Ireland, and most of
the opposition parties
accept this, and this isn’t
their main contention
with the deal. The main
problem throughout has
been trust, or a lack of
it. If Theresa May had
brought Parliament
along at the very begin-
ning of the process and
given Parliament an op-
portunity to find where
a negotiated consensus
could lie, she could have
negotiated this with the
EU and we would not be
in this mess.
Theresa May’s
strategy may just about
get her over the line
by holding a gun to
everyone’s head in
Parliament, but I doubt
it. In all likelihood she
will lose her vote again
next week perhaps by a
smaller margin of defeat,
but all this defeat will
ultimately do is waste
yet more time. We are
merely 2 weeks from our
planned exit date which
surely has to be delayed
now, and we can’t be
wasting time on failed
strategies. The only
thing that is becoming
clearer by the day is this
PM’s ineptitude and the
need for her to go.

votes, so who can blame
her for going again.
Perhaps because what
the country needs isn’t
the political equivalent
of the “devil finger” kid
from CBBC, who would
claim his finger was
possessed by the devil

On Wednesday night,
there was a vote to “rule

where things got worse
for the Prime Minister.
The motion she put to
