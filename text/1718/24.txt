The sun is setting on animal agriculture // Teri James Photography
Is it the end of the road for livestock farming?
Production of animal products is responsible for over three quarters of agricultural land usage, a major emitter of
greenhouse gases and a key driver of deforestation

human contribu-
tions to global
warming are naturally
fraught with confusion
due to the sheer enormity
and complexity of the
issue, but can also be
twisted by those whose
proximal goals conflict
with the changes neces-
sary to address it.
One such point of
confusion frequently
used to mask the true
consequences of animal
agriculture is its impact
on the emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs)
including methane – an
often overlooked but in-
tensely important contrib-
utor to global warming.
A recent example of
this was seen during
an exchange between
animal rights activist
Ed Winters, ‘Earthling
Ed’, and Phil Stocker,
CEO of the National
Sheep Association, on
Victoria Derbyshire’s
BBC 2 show. During the
segment, Mr. Stocker
noted the longstanding
criticism of ruminant
animals including cattle
and sheep regarding their
production of methane
as a by-product of diges-
tion. However, he then
proceeded to dismiss it,
claiming this production
is simply “part of a natural
gaseous cycle” that the
Earth has “adapted to
cope with” over thou-
sands of years. This was
exemplified again during
a conversation on The
Big Questions, also fea-
turing Ed, when a butcher
speaking in defence of
farming practices skipped
over the issue of methane
emission entirely while
praising the carbon-stor-
ing properties of the
grasslands that constitute
much of the land used in
UK agriculture. The la-
belling of such emissions
from livestock as ‘natural’
and therefore not worthy
of concern, or neglecting
to mention them at all, is
misguided at best, if not
nefarious when the true
implications considered.
“In terms of
their global
warming
potential,
methane
outscores CO2
by a factor of
up to 28 to 1”
“80% of
deforested
areas in Brazil
is currently
being used for
pasture”
Greenhouse gases often
fall under the same rubric
in debates concerning
environmental issues, but
are anything but similar
in their effects. Methane,
it is true, is shorter-lived
than CO2
and makes up
a comparative minority
of total greenhouse gas
emissions, clocking in at
16% of global emissions
compared to 76% from
CO2
, as reported by the
Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change
(IPCC) in 2014. However,
in terms of their global
warming potential (a
measure of the relative
capacity of a gas to absorb
radiation emitted from
the Earth’s surface, pre-
venting it from escaping
and thus warming the
planet) methane outscores
CO2
by a factor of up
to twenty eight to one.
Consider this alongside
the fact that agriculture is
consistently ranked as one
of the largest sectors (if
not the largest sector) in
terms of its contribution
to methane emissions, and
the severity of the issue
starts to become apparent.
Animal agriculture
contributes to climate
change in numerous
ways, but among the
most notable is its status
as a leading cause of de-
forestation. This clearing
of rich and diverse areas
of plant life to make way
for land on which cattle
can graze, and where food
can be grown and fed to
livestock, is perhaps most
famed for its devastation
of the Amazon rainforest.
Deforestation in this
region hit its highest rate
in a decade last year,
with nearly 8,000 square
kilometres being cleared.
Cattle ranching is now
considered to be its most
significant cause, and
nearly 80% of deforested
areas in Brazil (which
contains approximately
60% of the rainforest) are
currently used for pasture.
Whilst this is a potent
example of the motiva-
tions behind these activi-
ties and of the enormous
proportions of land used
for nothing but raising
and feeding livestock,
this is hardly an extreme
example when considered
globally. 77% of the
world’s agricultural land
is currently used for live-
stock farming purposes
including growing crops
for animal feed, while in
the UK the production of
animal-based products
makes up 85% of the land
footprint.
This issue of land use
really takes us to the
heart of the issue and
highlights the hypocrisy
and near-sightedness
of skimming over the
negative consequences of
animal agriculture includ-
ing methane emissions,
and of characterising the
side effects of our mas-
sively overinflated live-
stock trade as something
natural. It is true that CO2
emissions exceed those of
methane, but its removal
from the atmosphere
depends directly on pro-
cesses which are inher-
ently compromised by the
mass raising of livestock.
This occurs via carbon
sequestration: the process
by which CO2
is removed
from the atmosphere
and stored by forests,
grasslands and other
such areas, with forests
having the advantage of
greater above-ground
biomass per area of earth,
meaning they may serve
as better long-term carbon
sinks than grasslands. A
recent study from Oxford
university concluded
that excluding animal
products from one’s diet
can reduce emissions as-
sociated with their food’s
production by 49%, and
that the land required for
food production could be
reduced by 76% if such a
diet was adopted globally.
Alongside this, a recent
Nature paper which was
considered the most
comprehensive study to
date of the environmental
consequences of food

production recommended
drastic decreases in our
consumption of meat,
dairy and eggs, accom-
panied by increased con-
sumption of plant-derived
foods such as beans, nuts
and seeds to counteract
drivers of climate change.
Climate scientists
recently warned that we
have around twelve years
to backpedal our impact
to cap the ongoing tem-
perature rise to 1.5°C –
the maximum that can be
tolerated to avoid the most
catastrophic projections
of continued warming.
Even assuming this target
is met, however, the fore-
casts are grim. The World
Health Organisation has
estimated a rise of 95,000
child deaths per year
due to malnutrition, and
60,000 extra deaths from
malaria worldwide, while
upwards of 100 million
people could be plunged
into extreme poverty
according to the IPCC.
Reports from these organ-
isations and others includ-
ing the Tyndall Centre for
Climate Change Research
further estimate that up to
150 million people may
be affected by drastic
sea level rises during the
coming century. Ocean
acidification due to dis-
solved CO2
could also
have devastating effects,
with a predicted 70-90%
decline in existing coral
reefs – a major source of
food and protection to
people as well as a host of
diverse marine life.
Doing everything we
can to reduce our current
impact on the planet is
imperative to minimise
these consequences to as
large a degree as possible,
and reducing our reliance
on animal agriculture is
among the most logical,
not to mention ethical,
places to start. And in
case the information
above isn’t enough of an
incentive, the benefits
of making such changes
are by no means limited
to counteracting global
warming. Increased food
availability resulting
from the redistribution of
crops to humans instead
of livestock, which results
in a much lower yield of
food production, could
mean an end to world
hunger given a permit-
ting political climate.
Additionally, a host of
powerful medicines may
remain to be discovered in
the diminishing rainforest,
supplementing the current
list including Quinine, a
medication used to treat
malaria, and Vincristine
and Vinblastine – com-
pounds used in cancer
treatments to prevent cells
from dividing.
One thing is for sure –
there is nothing ‘natural’
about the levels of emis-
sions currently generated
by raising livestock.
Rather, it is one of the
main factors endangering
everything that is.
