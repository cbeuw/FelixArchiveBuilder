are the two
most widely
used tools governments
and central banks use
to control a nation’s
economy. You may have
read in FT about how the
Federal Reserve, the US
Central Bank has become
“dovish”, due to its overly
“hawkish” stance last
year due to Trump’s fiscal
policy. In this educational
article we will try and un-
derstand what this means.
growth, such a case
occurred in the chaos after
the 2008 financial crash.
Fiscal policy is largely
based on the ideas of
the British economist
Keynes and involves the
government changing
the levels of taxation and
government spending
in order to influence
Aggregate Demand and
the level of economic
activity. Keynes argued
that governments could
stabilize the business
cycle and regulate
economic output by
adjusting spending and
tax policies. Expansionary
fiscal policy involves
lowering taxes, giving
people more money to
spend and invest. Firms
will hire more people,
decreasing unemployment
and causing labour
competition, thus raising
wages. This has the
same effect as injecting
money into the economy.
Increasing government
spending means
increased investment
in infrastructure, again
increasing employment.
However, this will lead to
a deficit and often inflation
and asset bubbles.
Furthermore, while the
effects of fiscal policy
are usually profound, the
trickle-down time for the
general consumer is long
and government spending
is inefficient. Free market
economists argue that
higher government
spending will tend to
be wasted on inefficient
spending projects.
On Tuesday the
White House released
Trump’s Fiscal Year
2020 Budget Request. It
follows previous budget
plans in lower regulation
and tax on the financial
industry and increasing
government spending.
The record $4.7 trn annual
budget that boosts military
spending and includes
$8.6bn for US-Mexico
border wall. Economists
said the projections for
the budget of economic
growth of 3.2% were
highly optimistic. “The
US economy is definitely
slowing down. The data
we have seen so far for
the first quarter has been
pretty awful”, said Megan
Greene, chief economist
“The US

interest rates is called
being hawkish and dovish
respectively. If a central
bank has a hawkish
stance this has a positive
effect on the country’s
currency, and prevents
excessive inflation but
slows economic growth.
This is because increasing
interest rates increases
the cost of borrowing,
increasing the incentive
to save rather than spend.
A dovish stance has a
negative effect on the
country’s currency but
stimulates economic
growth and prevents
deflation.
Another tool a central
bank might use is open
market operations. OMO
refers to a central bank
buying and selling of
government securities in
the open market in order
to expand or contract the
amount of money in the

purchases inject money
into the banking system
and stimulate growth
while sales of securities do
the opposite and contract

at Manulife. Mrs Greene
said that the US could hit
the target if it underwent
significant fiscal stimulus,
but that remains unlikely.
She argues that the
Trump administration
enacted a big tax cut in
2017- reducing individual
and corporate income
tax rates- but failed to
implementanybigreforms
on important matters such
as social security, the
US government pension
scheme, and Medicare.
Monetary policy is
a central bank’s action
that influences the
country’s money supply.
It is generally used for
the fine tuning of the
economy and is often very
effective. The aim is to
try and make the money
supply grow neither too
quickly, which would
cause excessive inflation,
nor too slowly, which
would hamper economic
growth. Ideally, inflation
(a quantitative measure
of the rate at which the
average price level of a
basket of selected goods
increase over time) is
kept in the 2-3% range,
and unemployment level
of around 5% and stable
exchange rate. There are
multiple techniques of
monetary control. The
first is changing interest
rates. Raising or lowering
