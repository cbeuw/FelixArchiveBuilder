behaviours are explored
and focused on at your
own pace. The aim is
to bring a greater un-
derstanding of current
difficulties and identify
themes or patterns that you
would like to change. You
can expect a counsellor to
give you time and space to
talk about your thoughts.
You can expect them to
ask questions and together
you’ll think about what
difficulties you’re having
and talk about alternative
perspectives of situations.
Counsellors will talk with
you about what you want
to change and together you
will look at mechanisms
to change your behaviour
and thoughts.
Counselling is not
giving advice or at-
tempting to sort out the
problems of a student, it
doesn’t give a diagnosis
or treatment. Counsellors
don’t expect a student to
behave in any particular
way and they won’t get
emotionally involved with
the student. Counselling
will not give you answers
and fix the problem.
Instead you work to-
gether to understand the
difficulties and talk about
strategies to change this.
Sometimes it can be
difficult to see what a
counsellor actually does.
Counsellors are trained to
listen so that they listen to
what is being said but also
the underlying subtleties.
They can identify pat-
terns, themes or feelings.
Counsellors don’t judge
and they want to help you
understand. Counsellors
are particularly valuable
because humans are
relational creatures and
they are meant to interact
with other people and
form a variety of relation-
ships. This means during
times of stress we need
a relational approach.
Talking to someone who
listens and helps us to
understand our feelings,
thoughts and behaviours.
People often prefer to
speak to counsellors than
family, friends, lecturers
or personal tutors. They
aren’t biased and they
won’t judge you. They
won’t get emotionally
involved, which family
and friends tend to, but
they do care. They bring
a level of support and
understanding that these
other people can’t bring.
some people and while
it can be incredibly ef-
fective at helping people
understand thoughts and
behaviours, it can bring
about different emotions
in different individuals.
For many people coun-
selling means letting go
of thoughts or behaviours
and that can be really
difficult. This is normal
and everyone who visits
the counselling service
should expect a very per-
sonal experience from the
sessions they attend.
This is not to say
that counselling doesn’t
massively help people.
Most students that use
the counselling service
find it hugely beneficial
to have that time to talk
and think. It allows them
to cope with their daily
life and study effectively.
They go on to achieve
the grades they want to
and participate in all the
activities that they wish
to. Counselling really can
make a huge difference to
your life and I encourage
you to reach out if you
need support.
In fact, I should address

the importance of asking
for help. Asking for help
does not make you weak;
it is one of the strongest
things you can do. As a
child we are often taught
to do it by ourselves:
eating, getting dressed
and brushing your teeth.
When learning how to
do these things, someone
guided you, told you
how to do it and helped
you when you struggled.
At university there are
further pressures to do
things yourself: washing
clothes, cooking, cleaning
and studying. It is still
fine to ask for help with
these things. Speaking
to friends, family, tutors
and support services may
seem like a huge step but
it is so important and will
make a huge difference to
your life.

The Under Pressure campaign, which aims to give students strategies for coping during periods of heightened
stress, returns on 18th
- 22nd
March
Check out what's on throughout the Under Pressure campaign // Imperial College Union
This session will give
you time to talk about
your concerns and think
together about what your
needs are. You’ll decide
together if counselling is
the best option or be sign-
posted to a service that
suits your needs more.
You may decide together
some strategies that
you can use before your
next session. You will
then get three ongoing
appointments that last for
50 minutes. After this you
will decide together how
best to use your remaining
four sessions. You may
Everyone has seen
films where someone
goes to a counsellor or
a therapist and lies on a
couch and tells their story.
The therapist asks “And
how do you feel about
that?” before “fixing” the
individual who then skips
out of the room, to find the
love of their life and live
happily ever after. With
images like this floating
around it can be difficult
to really understand what
counselling is; so what is
counselling and what does
it mean for you and other
students at Imperial?
Counselling is a con-
fidential and non-judge-
mental space in which
thoughts, feelings and
“Counselling is
a confidential
space in which
thoughts,
feelings and
behaviours are
explored”
“People often
prefer to speak
to counsellors
than family,
friends,
lecturers
or personal
tutors”
“Asking for
help does
not make you
weak”
“The

short period of
time”
and emotions. It doesn’t
address how you interact
with other people which
can sometimes be a useful
factor to consider. Speak
to your GP or visit the
Health Centre as they can
direct you to that service.
The NHS also offer IAPT
(Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies)
which can have shorter
waiting times and can be
easy to access. It can be
really useful and is worth
exploring.
Another useful tool is
Mindfulness. Mindful-
ness teaches you to pay
attention to the present
moment though breathing
and meditation practices.
Everyone benefits from
Mindfulness but it can par-
ticularly help if you feel
stressed or overwhelmed,
are struggling to concen-
trate or are feeling like
a failure. It can help you
manage your thoughts so
you can accept them and
disengage from negative
thinking or worrying.
The Chaplaincy offers
sessions on Mindfulness
which can help you learn
about the practice. This is
not just for students who
identify with a religion or
faith.
decide to leave them
until later on in the year
for stressful periods, for
example scheduling them
to be just before exams.
Counselling services
integrated into higher ed-
ucation are becoming in-
creasingly oversubscribed
and are being found to
have long waiting times.
This can be detrimental
to students who need
access to that support
but in some ways it’s an
indication that the stigma
of mental health is being
reduced and students are
aware of their mental
health and thinking about
ways to support it. To
everyone that reaches out
to the counselling service
I’m really proud of you,
it can be a huge step to
recognise that you need
help and then to actually
seek it as well is fantastic.
Particularly when there
are long waiting times
it can be worth thinking
aboutalternativesthatmay
provide some support.
Cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT) can be ac-
cessed through the NHS.
CBT largely looks at how
you process information,
how it is stored, used and
how it affects behaviours

Unlike many other
universities across the
UK, College has backed
the counselling service
and has put extra funding
into the service in order to
increase the staff resourc-
es. Staff numbers will
be increased throughout
the academic year which
should have an impact on
the waiting times. This
is taking longer than it
should have due to limited
space, but the service is
doing all that it can to see
as many students as pos-
sible and cut the waiting
times down. It’s massive-
ly frustrating for students
not to have access to this
service because there is
not enough space for them
to use. The service has the
resources to expand but
the College has not pro-
vided the space and this is
unacceptable. Wellbeing
should be everyone’s
problem so this is a call to
College to find the coun-
selling service the space
so that students can access
the support they need.
College also needs to
understand the impact a
fully functioning service
can have on the student
body as a whole. More
funding would give more
capabilities for group
sessions and workshops
to get students thinking
about their mental health
early on. Wellbeing
should be incorporated
into the curriculum so that
all students learn about
it, are aware of it and can
put coping mechanisms in
place should they experi-
ence difficulties.
Counselling can be a
painful experience for
Imperial
While this explains
counselling in general it
can be useful to under-
stand what happens at
the counselling service at
Imperial. The counselling
service offers short term
therapy, meaning a limited
number of sessions over a
short period of time. This
is for two reasons. Firstly,
short term therapy can
be particularly effective
for the demographic at
university. This is because
counselling can require
people to be accepting of
change and open minded
towards alternative per-
spectives of a situation.
Students at university are
already experiencing a
lot of change. This means
they can accept change
more willingly which can
make it particularly ef-
fective. The other reason
that short term therapy
is offered is to ensure
there is provision for all
students at Imperial.
The service has also
changed the way they
offer appointments. The
initial appointment is a
therapeutic consultation
that is up to 75 minutes.
