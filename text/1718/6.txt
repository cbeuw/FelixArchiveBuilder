Butler warned in 1935.
Butler, who was the most
decorated marine at the
time of his death, was
sent by his government to
SouthAmerica to establish
one banana republic after
another. The drums of war
are at it again, this time in
Venezuela, brought to you
by the geniuses who also
brought you the Iraq war,
such as John Bolton. The
Trump administration and
their lackeys in Europe
have defied international
laws and imposed an
illegal embargo on the
besieged country. These
neo-colonialist overlords
would have us believe
that their recognition of
Juan Guaido as “Acting
President” is based on
their commitment to
democracy. What an out-
rageous claim! Western
countries have slobbered
over one tyrant after
another – most notably
Mohamad Bin Salman
the crown prince of Saudi
Arabia who has launched
a brutal war on Yemen
killing hundreds of thou-
sands of people. Britain
andAmerica have not only
refused to condemn them,
but instead has facilitated
the Yemeni genocide by
supplying weapons to the
theocratic and totalitarian
regime in Saudi Arabia.
What election has the
House of Saud won?
Venezuela on the other
hand is an actual imperfect
democracy. Venezuela’s
crime of keeping their oil
wealth to themselves is
a crime the west cannot
abide by. Since the
Bolivarian Revolution of
1999, Hugo Chavez was
elected to the presidency
three times with thumping
mandates in the ballot
box. Each election has
faced tough scrutiny by
international observers
- from Jimmy Carter to
the United Nations - and,
each time, the elections
were certified to be free
and fair. In fact, in the last
presidential election, the
opposition implored in-
ternational organisations
to not come to Venezuela,
because they knew it
would be certified and
consequently diminish
their narrative.
To be fair, Chavez’s
successor Nicolás Maduro
has made many mistakes
and has shown author-
itarian tendencies. But
one cannot look at the hy-
per-inflation, shortages of
essentials or the political
instability in Venezuela
in a vacuum. Britain
has seized 1.5 billion
dollars of gold reserves
that Venezuela had in the
Bank of England. The US
has frozen the accounts of
SITCO, the Venezuelan
state-owned oil company,
and has diverted funds
to American creditors
instead. The United
Nations official report
has said that the tactics
employed by this neo-co-
lonial axis is nothing short
of a “medieval siege -
using starvation to obtain
Venezuela’s oil”.
Furthermore, if Vene-
zuela is such a totalitarian
regime then how was it
that whilst Maduro has
been in power, the Vene-
zuelan opposition gained
a super majority in the
National Assembly? What
sort of dictatorship allows
mass demonstrations?
What sort of tyrant allows
a self proclaimed “Acting
President” to elicit foreign
support whilst publicly
advocating the overthrow
of the state? The Juan
Guaido led opposition is
not a Gandhian non-vi-
olent movement, but
they have thrown bricks
and stones at the police
and military, and incited
violence. Would any other
government allow a figure
like Guaido to walk the
streets with impunity,
after publicly conspiring
to sell off the oil wealth of
Venezuela to the highest
foreign bidders, and
openly call for the military
to commit treason and
abandon the duly elected
civilian government.
History may not repeat
itself, but it does rhyme.
In 2002 the United
States tried to overthrow
Chavez in a coup. And
now, neo-cons like Elliot
Abrams, who was a con-
victed felon due to his role
in the Iran-Contra scandal
and needed a presidential
pardon, are shepherding
this new regime change
project. And they have
been greatly assisted by
the corporate media. Yes,
rigging, but because the
opposition didn’t partic-
ipate in them, knowing
they would loose.
It is clear that the gov-
ernment has committed
many economic blunders.
It is clear that there have
been many arrests moti-
vated not by justice but by
political convenience. It is
clear that Maduro has lost
the confidence of a signif-
icant section of the pop-
ulation. But the Maduro
government must not be
overthrown by the threat
of a foreign sword at their
neck. In the next election,
the opposition can not
refuse to participate. The
international community,
led by the United Nations
must be allowed to vigor-
ously supervise the next
election, to ensure a free
and fair process. And this
colonial alliance must stop
this immoral blockade of
Venezuela.
Venezuela communists back Maduro against pro-US right // Telesur
“To be fair,
Chavez’s
successor
Nicolas
Maduro has
made many
mistakes and
has shown
authoritarian
tendencies”
there have been large
anti-Maduro demonstra-
tions, but the media has
conveniently ignored that
there were bigger concur-
rent pro-Maduro marches.
The media has failed to
highlight the reasons why
Maduro had a sweeping
victory in the last election
was not because of vote
“The drums
of war are
at it again,
this time in
Venezuela”
