Psychodrama Review
A track-by-track run through of Dave’s introspective
masterpiece.
Asad Raja
The bars on this track
are delivered with particu-
lar potency, over a simple
piano refrain. The beat
switch up is very mad,
immediately incredibly
attention-grabbing; a kind
of jazzy, experimental,
dancehall melody takes
the track in a refreshingly
different direction. - AR
With Psychodrama, Dave stakes a claim for the top spot in UK rap // Hypebeast
1. Psycho
W
hat a way
to kick off
the album.
A truly
building track, Dave
and the instrumentation
become one as the lis-
tener is guided through
the three main psyches
that Dave will expand on
throughout the album.
Not only does he switch
up his flow, content and
delivery with each transi-
tion, but he does so whilst
giving us plenty of his
signature witty wordplay.
He sounds a fierce kind of
bare initially, an energy
comparable to Stormzy’s
‘First Things First’ over
spacey moans and rattling
drums as he sharply spits:
“Stop all the pain / Tell
me how you stop all the
pain”. This, as well as
many other bars in this
album, serve as a reply
to a therapist character,
whose conversational
prompts appear between
songs, and at the very start
of this one. As the track
progresses, the moans
suddenly get chopped and
screwed, the drums going
2. Streatham
The simple yet effec-
tive beat sounds amazing
beneath Dave’s narration
of the South London
environment he grew up
in where “Teachers was
giving man tests / Same
time the mandem were
giving out testers”. - AR
Bars on bars. Dave has
many quotables through-
out this album – such as
“I don’t want to do you
and I (U-N-I), like I’m
in Leicester skipping my
lectures” – which will
have you screaming,
“RELOAD IT!” - AD
3. Black
A single released
before the album, ‘Black’
is a thorough, nuanced
and emotive delve into
what it means to be black
in Britain today. It’s as-
tounding how much Dave
is able to cover in just
this one track. He goes
into social experience,
heritage, history and
media perception. - AR
This single is much
braver and hard-hitting
than some of Dave’s
earlier work. His reflec-
tions on race and identity
are nuanced and mature.

4. Purple Heart
The production
goes super sweet here,
complete with delicate
backing vocals and an
acoustic guitar, as Dave
delivers a personal
verse on his passionate
yet mature approach to
matters of the heart. The
wordplay on this track is
particularly impressive,
centering around star-
signs, a deck of cards,
and chess to conjure up
themes of chance, but also
to accentuate Dave’s point
at the start of the track:
“You’re asking what it’s
like to love, I told her
love’s a game”. - AR
Dave is really starting
to open up now with
reflections on his relation-
ship. “I’ve got a Purple
Heart / You’ve got a
Purple Heart” he says, re-
ferring to accolades given
to military who have been
injured in combat. He uses
his signature wordplay
to deliver emotions in
a way that isn’t cheesy.
This level of vulnerability
isn’t common in UK rap.
Watch out Drake, Dave’s
coming for your softboi
insta captions - SK.
More of a laidback pop
tune, Dave delivers some
of his most playful bars.
He briefly touches on his
relationship with his ends
following his fame using
some clever wordplay, a
topic which comes up a
few times throughout the
album: “If you wanna see
Ps you gotta pass on the
ends (Ns)”. - AR
5. Location
6. Disaster
This is probably one
of the most talked about
tracks on the album,
7. Screwface Capital
8. Environment
9. Lesley
‘Lesley’ is 11 minutes
long, an absolute
behemoth of a track that
follows a character caught
in an abusive relationship.
By focusing on this kind
of narrative, Dave can
really show off his ability
to craft language and tell
a story. Like a pictureless
screenplay, the scene is
set and the audience can
only wait as the story
unfolds. - SK
10. Voices
On ‘Voices’, Dave
actually sings. Although
his range is not quite what
a feature could acheive,
the result is powerful. He
is baring his soul as his
therapy comes to an end.
- SK
11. Drama
‘Drama’, though not
exactly a bonus track,
is a departure from the
narrative of the album, a
self-contained stream of
consciousness addressed
directly to Dave’s brother
who is serving time in
prison. The track starts
and ends with a voicemail
from Dave’s brother,
where he speaks about
how proud he is to have
witnessed Dave’s rise to
success. He also implies
that Dave is destined
to be the one to help
him through his mental
suffering (the therapy
focused theme of the
album is in fact inspired
by the therapy Dave’s
brother is receiving in
prison). Arguably the
most personal of a highly
personal album, the verse
on this song is divulg-
ing, moving and highly
pensive. The bar that
Dave ends with succinctly
brings the entire album
home: “I thank God for
the pain because it made
me this”. - AR
Things get stripped
back to a piano backing.
The vibe is smooth but
the subject matter sharp
as Dave reflects on how
he is viewed by others. He
is cutting and resentful,
explaining how his life
and stardom is not as
glamorous as it seems.
“You see our gold chains
and our flashy cars / I see
a lack of self worth and I
see battle scars” - SK

Editor-in-Chief
bouncier as Dave gives us
carefree and cocky vibes.
Piano keys then smoothly
glide the track into a more
solemn, introspective di-
rection as he admits deep
insecurities. His honesty
is clear as he admits his
battle with depression and
his need for therapy, in
stark contrast to his asser-
tion of not wanting to be
“saved” or reveal scars at
the start of the track. - AR

minutes
Psychodrama
which makes sense as it
sees Dave and J Hus, two
of the biggest voices in
the UK rap scene, go back
and forth. Each really
hold their own, making
for an absolute banger of
a song. Hearing how on
form J Hus sounds has me
itching to hear whatever
he offers up when released
from prison. - AR
