“Player 2” not “xX_Ninj4SWAG_69_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_Xx’!
Why AAA companies are failing at making fun multiplayer games

L
ike many of my
generation, I’m
sure many of you
reading this ar-
ticle were once kids who
tried to find every minikit
in the LEGO Star Wars
games. Whether it was the
infuriating driving scenes,
creating the ultimate
custom character (bounty
hunter helmet + lightsaber
in my case), or saving up
the studs necessary to buy
force ghost Yoda, many
of us have fond memories
of that game. But in truth,
the game is simple, and
nowadays it would be
considered mediocre at
best and boring at worst.
Features such as many
collectibles and repetitive
combat are now consid-
ered deplorable things and
are mocked in the gaming
community today. So what
made LEGO Star Wars
different? My answer: the
permanent existence of
Player 2.
For many of us, this
was the game that you’d
play at a sleepover or what
you play when you invited
your best mate round to
your home. It wasn’t fun
unless both of you were
there playing it together,
unlocking characters and
making mistakes. It was a
true co-op game, a breed
that is unfortunately dying
out.
Allow me to first define
the difference between
Multiplayer and Co-op.
Multiplayer games thrive
with the more players they
have. Fortnite, Battlefield,
World of Warcraft - these
are games with vastly
different mechanics, their
enjoyable nature coming
as a product of the scale
of their player base,
with a massive number
of people competing in
large teams or against
one another. Co-op on the
other hand functions on
a smaller scale. Classics
include Left 4 Dead,
Borderlands, and Portal 2.
A key difference between
the two is the attitude
towards the number of
players and the gameplay.
In Multiplayer, the fun
is focused on the shared
experience, but doing so
often limits the immersion
of the individual. There
are exceptions, such as
the classic Star Wars Bat-
tlefront games, where you
had to earn your classes
in the battle through
racking up kills. Unlike
many of the current mul-
tiplayers games, which
have various abilities and
accessories, your skill was
the only thing that was
carried across matches.
Co-op, on the other hand,
is often optimised for a
handful of players. This
“Though
the triple A
landscape is
bleak, luckily
there are
survivors”
“The nature
of gaming
has changed,
and Co-op has
evolved into
something
else, MOBAs”
can be seen by things
such as mechanics where
a team member can revive
another, or where abilities
focus on improving the
overall effects of the party.
However, a growing trend
has me concerned.
I’m sure there will be
accusations of gatekeep-
ing, but I do not consider
games such as Destiny,
The Division and Anthem
to be Co-op games. They
are “shared world” sin-
gleplayer games, which
is another way of saying
MMOs done badly. The
original hype of Destiny
becoming the new Halo
was rapidly lost, and
although the game has
improved, it has failed to
capture the core fun that
came from games like
Halo 2 and the fast paced
classic shooters it tried to
match. Anthem is riddled
with problems, besides
the technical ones that
are spreading across the
internet. The problem lies
within the fact that these
games are based off of
the idea that Co-op and
Multiplayer are the same,
and that using Multiplayer
game design in a Single-
player world achieves the
equivalent.
It does not.
Though the triple A
landscape is bleak, luckily
there are survivors.
Gameplay that is as fun
as couch Co-op rarely
goes unnoticed. Indie
studios are keeping the
genre alive, and classics
like Magicka and Left 4
Dead will always be fun
to play. But the nature of
gaming has changed, and
Co-op has evolved into
something else, MOBAs.
Now I realise that many
will say that MOBAs are
Multiplayer, that just
because you team up with
your friends to fight on the
same team doesn’t make
it Co-op. But for me, the
feeling I get when playing
DotA or Overwatch or
League is the same feeling
of working towards some-
thing with a friend that I
had when I was younger.
Though competitive, the
feel of a MOBA when
playing with friends
in company to random
strangers online is not the
same as the equivalent in
large scale multiplayer
games. In my humble
opinion, I believe I know
why this is.
In Battlefield, your
squad are a blip on a large
map. Your fun comes from
when you each capture
a point or rack up your
K/D ratio. In Borderlands,
you and your friends
are wildly firing ability
spamming your way to the
boss fight. Your fun will
come from the utter chaos
of the environment you’ve
thrown yourself into and
getting that sweet, sweet
loot. In MOBAs, you and
your team depend on each
other to successfully and
tactically take the enemy
towers down, whilst
holding their own in a
fight.
In short, Co-op games
are fun, because they
are cooperative (No shit
Sherlock, right?). Your
score is irrelevant unless
all of you survive; your
victory is short-lived if
others are failing; your
success is only thanks to
the combined efforts of
the team. In the end, it is
a team game, and team
games are always more
fun if you know your
team.
Good Co-op games are
few and far in between,
and these big imposter
games that prioritise your
own personal loot and
success over core fun
team gameplay fail to
realise the joy of winning
with a team, and what it
means to have your Player
2, your team. But gaming
has gone through many
iterations, and maybe
after the MOBA boom
and the arena boom that
followed it, a Co-op boom
will follow.
In the meantime, I’ll
be branching out into 2D
rogue-likes, those early
access Kickstarter games
aren’t gonna fund them-
selves!
