A sonic odyssey that mystifies as much as it inspires
A
dorned with
a cowboy hat
and staring
longingly into
the camera during the
promo video, the elder
Knowles sister knows
how to build hype for an
album, following it up by
providing us with another
experimental and soulful
LP. Its demo-like quality
and cryptic lyrics may
discourage new listeners,
but for fans of her previ-
ous work this serves as a
fitting continuation of her
mid-career reinvention.
The memory of lis-
tening to A Seat At The
Table for the first time is
still vivid. Its cinematic
quality and curated
interludes provided a
listening experience like
no other as we drove
through the boredom of
the swiss underpass. Its
cultural significance to
the #BlackLivesMatter
movement cannot be
understated, with tracks
like ‘Don’t Touch My
Hair’ and ‘Mad’ piercing
through the media noise
like a beacon in fog.
Compared to her last
LP, When I Get Home
takes a more languid
and indirect manner to
expressing the inner
workings of her mind. If
ASATT’s approach resem-
bles the fast train at rush
hour, this record is instead
more similar to a spacious,
nocturnal journey on the
Overground; from the
opening track, the soul
maestro launches into a
melodic and beautifully
arranged cut, hypnotising
the listener with the
lullaby-esque ‘Things
I Imagined’. Moving
forward, the album ma-
terialises into a dreamy
soundscape, sprinkled
with puzzling samples
and some very icy synths.
Staying true to her
roots is a key theme in this
album, demonstrating Sol-
ange’s insistence on not
letting mainstream atten-
tion hinder her art. ‘Down
With The Clique’ serves
as a PSA for not forgetting
your origins, with ‘Stay
Flo’ commenting on the
fickle characters present
in the industry. Following
up, she launches into
‘Dreams’, a standout
track whose soothing
piano melody overlays
a stunning vocal per-
formance. This record’s
attention to composition
creates a wistful and
transporting environment
that is only heightened
with ‘Almeda’. A more
rap-influenced track
thanks to the work of
Pharrell on the boards,
Solange’s call to arms
of the black community
combines a hazy instru-
mental feel with a more
upbeat hook, although
this message is somewhat
diminished with one of
Playboi Carti’s most
uninspiring verses to date.
Another powerful track
on this album is ‘Jerrod’;
The lyrics are delivered
mostly in disyllabic
bursts, cutting through the
stunning piano progres-
sion in the background.
A lot of parallels can
be drawn between this
release and Earl Sweat-
shirt’s latest Some Rap
Songs in terms of the use
of samples. In both cases,
the vocal samples give a
stream of consciousness
feel to the progression
of the record, giving the
semblance of being one
long track. Moreover, the
lyrics leave a lot to the
imagination, but one can’t
help but feel that each
word is carefully placed,
which she alludes to with
the ‘Nothing Without
Intention (Interlude)’.
However, the repetitive
nature of the album can
sometimes take away
from the listener’s en-
joyment, and the features
aren’t capitalised on
enough; Tyler the Creator
and Sampha are only used
briefly and intermittently,
preventing them from
making a real impact on
the tracks they appear on.
The Gucci Mane feature
on ‘My Skin My Logo’
comes straight out of left
field and gives the song an
oddly duet-like feel.
The unpredictability of
this album really reflects
the soul singer’s current
career path, keeping the
listener guessing with
every move she makes.
The experimental period
of her career is continuing
to produce sonic gems
and we can only hope for
the same with her next
release.
Justice has been served, and it sounds amazing
S
o, I sit down in the
Woodward study
room ready to sink
my teeth into some
epidemiology, cut to three
hours later and I finally
start working. This wasn’t
your average YouTube/
Facebook/ “really
need to reply to these
week-old emails” kind of
procrastination - this was
JUSTICE!
You all know Justice,
you’ve all heard
‘D.A.N.C.E.’ and you’ve
all enjoyed it. Every
person from everywhere
loves that song, but did
you know they have other
amazing music too? The
electronic French duo
have produced a number
of incredible songs over
the last decade that you are
guaranteed to have heard
at some point in your life:
‘We Are Your Friends’,
‘Genesis’, etc. I’ve been a
fan of their music for the
last few years but when I
stumbled onto their 2018
release Woman Worldwide
I lost my tiny little mind.
I’m actually writing this
while listening to the
album for the first time, I
haven’t even finished yet!
I am certainly biased
because I love them SO
MUCH and this album is
a biggest hits type-thing.
Take all their best bits over
the last ten years, have the
performers at the top of
their game come hot off
worldwide tours, and then
concentrate it down into
one continuous hour and
half studio set - you get
this album.
It’s fucking sublime.
Sorry but it’s impossi-
ble for me to analyse this
album with an objective
lens. I refuse to do
anything other than enjoy
this majesty of electronic
energy. If you want some
actual proof that this is
good, then allow me to
direct your attention to the
Grammy for Best Dance/
Electronic Album of
2018 – Woman Worldwide
(duh). Yes, I know the
Grammys are prone to
bullshit (like how hell did
Macklemore beat Ken-
drick’s good kid, m.A.A.d
city in 2014 for Best Rap
Album??) but Justice’s
award should at least be
enough to convince you
that they’re better than
good.
The French men work
with a foundation of
vintage funk, disco and
house, but also take in-
fluence from prog, metal,
new wave, indie, and a hell
of a lot more. That’s all I
want to say about them.
Now go forth children!
Listen to this album, ex-
perience the beauty, and
then tell me how much I
overhyped it. I don’t care
if you disagree, I won’t be
able to hear you through
the liquid gold Justice so
kindly poured into my
ears.

A big fish in an even bigger pond
Picking up where 2017’s TheWeather left off, Aussie psychedelic rockers Pond are back, and they’re bigger, better,
and bolder than ever before.
T
his March,
Australia will
be the centre of
gravity for psych
rock and Formula 1 fans
alike. But no matter how
hot Ferrari are looking, in
my heart I doubt that the
action on the black asphalt
of Albert Park will be able
to overshadow what’s
hiding in the grooves of
the new Pond LP. Here’s
why.
The sounds and stories
of Australia’s biggest
psych rock bands have
always been intertwined.
As Kevin Parker, Jesus
in Sandals™ and most
prominent representative
of said bands, once noted:
“There is no Australian
psych rock scene, we’re
just ten people.” For
Tame Impala and Pond,
the merging of sound has
much to do with the fact
that they used to, and to a
lesser extent still do, share
band members. KP used
to play drums for Pond,
Pond’s Nick Allbrook
used to tour with Tame
Impala, Pond’s Shiny Joe
Ryan does Tame Impala’s
visuals, and Jay Watson
is the last throbbing
artery connecting these
bands with crossover
roots – and is a permanent
member of both bands.
Most importantly, Kevin
Parker has produced all of
Pond’s albums; all of this
is crucial to understanding
the transition in Pond’s
sound that started with the
release of Man It Feels
Like Space Again in 2015,
and has finally completely
blossomed in Tasmania.
To me, Pond has always
been the slightly wonkier
little sister of Tame
Impala. There are several
reasons for that – from Al-
brook’s dodgy hair colour
choices to their sometimes
overdistorted sounds and
flippant titles (calling an
album Hobo Rocket and a
song ‘Heroic Shart’ might
unintentionally give that
impression). Perhaps it is
because Pond are more of
an actual band than Tame
Impala (where Kevin’s
singular vision is the
driving force, resulting
in a very homogenized
musical product) that their
albums have historically
been a bit more all-over-
the-place and in-your-
face. This album changes
that somewhat, bringing a
more polished sound.
in a land where “it’s spring
and the cherry blossoms
sprout,” with “fires
bejewelling the South
West”. All of a sudden,
we’re told our subject is
“smiling like he has to for
the cause, for the tribe, for
the boys, for the lie” and
just like that the drums
come in and the rest of the
song unfolds as a combi-
nation of a punchy, upbeat
melody and lyrics that
range from slightly un-
comfortable to borderline
morbid. “Me and the men
of the frontier stack the
bodies in a heap / Jimmy
grabs a beer and we wash
our hands in a creek,”
evokes the image of a
death factory. It hints at
the reciprocal relationship
of “we clean ourselves
by implicating nature in
our filth”. Ah, that filthy
black soul of capitalism.
I should also mention that
with the synths jumping
up and down the chorus,
they have definitely taken
a leaf out of Currents’
book. These elements are
a perfect prelude for the
rest of the album.
‘Sixteen Days’ is not
one of the most notewor-
thy tracks on the album,
but it does contain a line
which goes to show that
the band hasn’t given
up on shitstirring lyrics
completely – “now I know
how a suckerfish feels,
shit, I better call my Dad.”
Lovely! Next, the title
track gives us some clues
as to the album’s name.
In the first two verses, the
rhymes are too obvious
and lazy to be that way ac-
cidentally – perhaps criti-
quing sloppy songwriting
and empty meanings in
modern music? Anyway,
our subject wants a break
in ‘Tasmania’: “I left my
phone in Sydney / All
the stress outdid me,”
something which he later
wishes for again in ‘Burnt
Out Star’.
‘The Boys Are Killing
Me’, is one of my quiet
favourites on the album.
The tempo, Nick’s
diction, and the thickness
of sound mediated by the
effects used, change so
many times that the song
feels like a ruler twisted
into the figure 8 – taut to
the extreme but remain-
ing unbroken. “Drunk
but overjoyed just to be
employed / By the boys
/ The boys are killing
me” reads as if written
by someone coexisting in
a toxic society but glad
just to fit in – a paradox
of wanting change but not
wanting to be left out for
instigating it. Yikes!
In ‘Hand Mouth
Dancer’, the political
nature of the album’s
lyrics is addressed, play-
fully acknowledging the
hypocrisy that sometimes
goes hand in hand with
politicisation of music,
and the people who
demand it. ‘Burnt Out
Star’ is this album’s epi-
centre, the magnum opus,
having been released as a
single long ago (so long
many thought it would be
a standalone single). It is
a journey through sound,
flashing some wonder-
fully poetic lines on the
way. “Burnt out star, no
matter where you are / try
to understand you’re only
a man” suggests that man-
kind’s collective strength
should come from a
realisation of individual
weakness. A potent lesson
hidden amongst woozy
ad-libs of the number 1917
– I guess the burnt out star
they’re thinking of is of
the RED variety… This
is to be the first allusion
to revolution as a possible
solution to the problems
the band perceive; the
other solution (escape?) is
carnal desire “Oh perfect
body that they’ll never
tear apart / first they’ll
have to tear my head from

TASMANIA
The themes in
Tasmania are somewhat
difficult to disentangle.
The lyrics don’t follow a
linear narrative, and seem
more like little snippets
from a daydream, floating
on a stark blue sky. In
this fashion the opener,
‘Daisy’, paints a picture
that seems oh so idealistic
in the first seconds. As the
synthesiser strings morph
tender chords from one
into another, we’re placed
“A
combination
of a punchy,
upbeat melody
and lyrics
that range
from slightly
uncomfortable
to borderline
morbid”
