ave you been
waiting on the
edge of your
seat for us to
finally write a Smash
Corner article on one of
the many famous Fire
Emblem playable fighters
in Ultimate? Well, you
can put your swords back
in their sheath because
we are going, once again,
to that obscure franchise
EarthBound with char-
acter #37 of the roster,
Lucas.
That’s right, the
franchise also known as
Mother has not only one
but two fighters repre-
senting it, even though
probably none of us have
actually played it. Lucas
appeared as the protago-
nist of the third instalment
of the series, making his
entrance to the Smash
roster in Brawl, and has
now been in every game
ever since, despite the fact
that they tried to get rid of
him in the Wii U version.
He persisted as a very
light, floaty and mobile
character with PSI attacks
to dominate his opponents
within a medium to long
range.
The heart of Lucas’s
move set is his special, of
which the most important
one being his neutral, PK
Freeze. It is a slow long-
ranged projectile that
freezes your enemy for a
short duration, launching
them off the edge of the
screen defenceless. Then
comes his side-special
PK Fire, a medium-range
linear projectile which
explodes and knocks back
enemies. Lucas’s down-B
is his PSI Magnet, a
great defensive tool that
will absorb any of your
opponent’s energy-based
projectile to heal himself.
And finally, his up-special
is his PK Thunder, a
highly dirigible tool which
can be used as both a long
range attack or a recovery
if you hit yourself with it.
The hardest part of
playing Lucas is master-
ing these specials. Firstly,
he has one of the weirdest
recoveries of the game,
but once you master your
PK Thunder recovery, you
can also launch yourself
at your opponent with it
to obtain a devastating
meteor smash. Then his
PK Freeze is also hard to
use, but once you manage
to steer it and anticipate
your enemy’s movements,
you have one of the best
edge guarding tools that
can obtain a kill from the
comfort and safety of the
stage. And even though
it is not that complicated,
you will probably end up
spamming PK Fire as it is
a great tool to simultane-
ously dish out the damage
and keep the opponents
away.
Lucas’s normal tilt
and smash attacks do
still fit very well with his
playstyle, as most of them
have a big knockback
to keep opponents away
if they come too close.
Take the knockback to
the extreme and you have
a great killing tool; the
prime example being his
up-smash an attack with
a huge hitbox that will
finish anybody higher
than 80%. However, you
will easily be punished
if you miss it is slow and
have a lot of lag time. If
you want a safer option to
end a stock, Lucas has a
very good tether grab to
catch your opponent even
at range and follow it up
with his forward, back or
up kill-throw.
All in all, Lucas has a
lot going for him, with his
high mobility, powerful
specials, his killing
throws. This takes him up
to a solid high tier, not too
far behind his Earthbound
buddy. But I personally
prefer to play Lucas since
he relies more on his
specials than Ness, so I
suggest you try him out
for once instead of the
usual basic-boy.
Is it a bird, is it a plane, no it’s ... a clone of Ness that has been around for way too long. Presenting Lucas the
character from that obscure series that not many people played!
