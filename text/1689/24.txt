Imperial Pole & Aerial take national title

T
his weekend
marks one of
the defining
achievements
of ICU Pole & Aerial
Society. In our fifth year
of taking part in the Inter-
University Pole Dance
Competition – the third
since regional heats were
formally introduced – the
Imperial team landed sol-
idly in first place, ranking
us 1st
of the 49 UK univer-
sities to compete.
In2017,adramainvolv-
ing miscounted scores and
wrongful trophy awarding
in the South East UK
Regional Heats finally
resulted in Imperial being
crowned the rightful
Regional Champions,
granting us the respon-
sibility of hosting this
year. In February, the
Union Concert Hall was
transformed into a pole
dance extravaganza for
twelve universities from
across the south east
in the 2018 South East
University Pole Dance
Competition (SEUPC)
regional championship.
Styles of dance ranged
widely from contempo-
rary to pole “classique”,
complete with fantastic
costumes and eight-inch
heels. Performers were
judged equally according
to technical difficulty,
fluidity, use of transitions,
music interpretation and
audience interaction.
Due to the focus on
dance and the flow of the
performance as a whole,
it’s not uncommon to
see extremely complex
tricks placing second or
third behind exceptional
or unusual performances.
We had strong competi-
tion and more than one
surprise to deal with, but
eventually Imperial ran
a tight show, finishing
exactly on schedule(!)
and managed to place 2nd
overall behind Sussex,
allowing us to qualify for
Nationals.
On 10th
March, the
eight qualifying universi-
ties from the South East,
South West, Midlands
and Northern regionals,
sent teams to Newcastle
to take part in the national
finals against their team.
Each university submitted
one performer each for
Beginner, Intermediate,
Advanced and Group cate-
gories, with Imperial once
again competing against
Sussex. Imperial’s team
of five included: President
Melissa Lee competing in
the group category with
Brandon Tsang and Alix
Regnier; Brandon also
competing in Advanced;
Donja Karimlou in In-
termediates; and Taylor
Lyons in Beginners. The
entourage consisted of
former President (and
superfan we can’t get to
leave) Robin De Meyere,
who came equipped with
his best cheers and lots
of love and support. He
supported the team from
Melissa’s excessive face
mask routine the night
before to the moment the
shield was handed over.
Imperial’s win comes
following a string of
increasing successes for
the society. Imperial’s first
entry into IUPDC came in
2014, and the society was
absolutely wowed by the
quality of performances
from across the country.
Gradually creeping up the
leaderboard, we placed 4th
in 2015, 3rd
in 2016 and
2nd
in 2017, so this year’s
win certainly follows the
trend! The competitors
also managed to score
some significant individ-
ual wins throughout the
year. In London Varsity
2018, Taylor Lyons
placed first in London in
the Beginners’ category.
Donja Karimlou took 2nd
and 3rd
place in South East
Regionals and Nationals
respectively (despite
creating a brand new
routine for finals in only
two weeks!) Brandon’s 2nd
place advanced routine at
SEUPC was awarded 3rd
in the country, and lastly
the group’s 1st
place win
at regionals continued
to wow at nationals,
awarding them 2nd
nation-
ally and cementing the
title for Imperial.
IUPDC has been oc-
curring in the UK since
2011, first hosted in
Cardiff with fewer than 15
universities competing.
As the competition grew,
more universities wanted
to take part, leading to
a first-come first-served
admittance system which
left many universities
side-lined. Following the
introduction of National
University Pole Associ-
ation (NUPA) in 2016
to regulate competition
rules and judging criteria,
IUPDC was able to
be expanded into four
regional qualifiers with
the top two universities
in each round heading
to the finals, massively
increasing the number of
universities permitted to
take part.
As competitions are
more spread out, with
fewer competitors per
day, the format of the
competition has changed
dramatically over time:
competitors are able to
pick their own music,
there is now only one
performer on stage at a
time and the number of
poles each performer can
use has also increased.
Dancers are now able to
use both spinning and
static poles, and they are
judged on how evenly
spread a performance is
between the two poles,
an analogous criterion to
professional competitions
like the aforementioned
World Pole Sport and
Fitness Championships,
or the GAISF-recognised
IPSF World Pole Sports
Championships.
As the championship
continues to progress and
develop with the increas-
ing popularity of pole
sports, ICU Pole & Aerial
Society are extremely
excited to be a part of the
expanding community
developed through this
competition. We are also
extremely proud to be
announced winners this
year, when pole dance was
officially internationally
recognised as a sport by
GAISF, showing our true
commitment to the athlet-
icism and grace involved
in this complex art form.
We are looking forward to
continuing our tradition of
attending and competing,
and are thrilled to be
awarded this title and the
honour of hosting the nine
talented finalist universi-
ties in IUPDC 2019.
