You Were Never Really Here – A thriller crossed with
a horror crossed with an intense character study

Good looks into his descent into madness and gives us his take on this nightmare-fuelled thriller.
T
ilda Swinton
once called
Lynne Ramsey
“the Real
McCoy”: a director whose
films could not have been
made by anybody else.
Best known for her quiet
and introspective work,
Ramsay has garnered
much critical acclaim –
even having an “Every
Frame a Painting” episode
dedicated to her work.
At first glance her latest
seems a startling volte-
face: the woman who
brought us We need to Talk
about Kevin, with its tense
family interactions, has
now directed a pulpy and
violent thriller? Yet under
the surface the two stories
have much in common
– most prominently
that the psychological
aspect of violence can be
every bit as damaging as
the physical. You Were
Never Really Here is one
of our most surprising
action-thrillers of recent
years: mostly quiet and
restrained, tension builds
until suddenly exploding
into a pulsating blast of
sound and fury.
The main character is
Joe (Joaquin Phoenix), an
aging PI whose principle
investigative technique
is violence. He seems
to specialise in tracking
down kidnapped children,
though his predilection
for ball-peen hammers
suggests his clientele is
the sort who want rough
justice. The film does
feature a strong support-
ing cast, including Judith
Roberts as Joe’s mother,
John Doman as his boss
,and Ekaterina Samsonov
as a girl kidnapped and
forced into prostitution;
all of them exist to a
greater or lesser extent at
the periphery with little
screen-time and fewer
lines. You Were Never
Really Here is most truly
a concerto for a solo actor,
and Phoenix excels as the
soloist. Joe comes with
“The film is
most truly a
concerto for a
solo actor, and
Phoenix excels
as the soloist”
“Ultimately,
the film is
more of a
character
study than a
straight up
thriller”
all the usual trappings
– a painkiller addiction,
PTSD from a military
career long past and a
childhood mutilated by
an abusive father. Yet the
control and embodiment
that Phoenix brings to the
characterisstaggering.It’s
nigh impossible to believe
that this is the same man
who played Commodus
in Gladiator or Freddie
Quell in The Master.
This is made all the more
impressive given how
spare the script is: mostly
he acts solely through his
haggard face and weighty
body language. The score,
by Jonny Greenwood
of Radiohead fame,
reinforces this sense of
concerto with a bifur-
cated structure. Using
extended periods of either
silence or a pulsating and
violent soundtrack, the
film can either let you
stay relatively relaxed or
clench you in tightly as it
ramps up the tension. This
masterfully controls the
mood, and Ramsay has an
exacting power over your
emotional response as a
viewer.
You Were Never Really
Here wears its influences
lightly but deeply. It is so
original and distinct yet
bears the hallmarks of a
wide variety of films and
film movements. It is most
definitely a noir: filled
with pessimism, violence
and a pulpy plot. Yet it
lacks the heightened sense
that defines most noirs
from Double Indemnity
to L.A. Confidential. This
realistic tone framing a
rather extraordinary plot
mirrors another film that
You Were Never Really
Here consciously apes –
Martin Scorsese’s Taxi
Driver. Both films share a
protagonist who struggles
to fit into society, who fail
to find meaning in their
lives, and whose violence
reflects their inner turmoil.
But these two broken men
are broken in different
ways. Travis Bickle is
the more detached; he
will try anything to define
himself, though can only
understand the languages
of violence and sex. It is
mere happenstance that
he ends up acclaimed for
killing a pimp – he could
have murdered the Presi-
dential candidate instead.
Joe, however, feels like
he was once functional
before washing up in his
current wrecked state – an
oxymoronic mixture of
rage, fear, and apathy. He
does not seek validation
from others, their desires
merely act as a loose
framework shaping his
actions. Indeed, whilst
Bickle seems unafraid
of death, Joe is haunted
by suicidal thoughts and
it is only those that rely
on him who break him
out of his apathetic bent,
driving him forwards. You
Were Never Really Here’s
other strong influence is
the horror genre. Psycho
is aptly referred to – both
films ramp up the sense of
dread and then suddenly
explode into violence.
Ramsay also visually
quotes The Shining – an
athematic reminder of the
self-destructive capabili-
ties of powerful men.
Ultimately, You Were
Never Really Here is
more of a character study
than a straight up thriller.
It is more interested in
how Joe reacts at every
moment, rather than the
implications of his actions
as they ripple through the
wider world. If you are
prepared to accept the film
and its preoccupations on
its own terms then you
will find an engaging and
thoughtful film, utterly
unlike anything else in
cinemas.
