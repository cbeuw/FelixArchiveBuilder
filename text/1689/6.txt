Potential further
strikes, as UCU
members feel UUK
offer falls extremely
short of demands.
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
T
he four weeks
of strikes that
have hit campus
end today, a
few days after a deal
to resolve the pensions
dispute was rejected.
The agreement would
have seen members of
the University and Col-
lege Union (UCU) make
larger pension contribu-
tions while the current
scheme is phased out.
The proposal, which
was considered by the
UCU’s Higher Education
Committee, would have
seen members and uni-
versities paying larger
amounts into pension
funds for three years as
T
he winners of
this year’s Im-
perial College
Union (ICU)
Leadership Elections
were revealed last Fri-
day.
The Officer Trustee
team for next academic
year will consist of Robert
Tomkies as Union Pres-
ident, James Medler as
Leadership Election winners revealed
Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) (DPCS),
Alejandro Luy as Deputy
President (Education)
(DPE), Claudia Carav-
ello as Deputy President
(Finance & Services)
(DPFS), and Becky Neil
as Deputy President
(Welfare) (DPW). Andy
Djaba will serve as Felix
Editor.
The contest for Union
President was one of the
closely-run in the elec-
tion, with ten candidates
in total. After nine rounds
of voting, during which
candidates were eliminat-
ed and their votes redis-
tributed, Robert Tomkies,
the current Royal School
of Mines Union (RSMU)
President was declared
the winner, with 1267
voted. He beat runner-up
Michael Edwards, the
current Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU)
President, who received
1045 votes.
The contests for DPFS
and DPW were also
contested, with three
candidates for DPFS and
two candidates for DPW.
In the race for DPFS,
Claudia Caravello was
declared the winner after
two rounds of voting.
She received 1236 votes,
while her closest compe-
tition, Ella Rice, received
1031. Becky Neil will be
the DPW for 2018-19,
after beating Matthew
Hayward after two rounds
of voting; she received
1198 votes compared to
Hayward’s 1090.
Alejandro Luy will be
next year’s DPE, receiving
2166 votes, while James
Medler will be DPCS,
with 2078 votes. Both
positions were uncon-
tested. Andy Djaba was
elected as Felix Editor in
the first round of voting,
beating three other can-
didates with 1356 votes.
The runner up Jennifer
Lea, who had promised
to “make FELIX edible”,
received 590 votes.
Presidents of five of
ICU’s six constituent
elections were also voted
in this week. The Presi-
dent of Imperial College
School of Medicine Stu-
dents’ Union (ICSMSU)
for next year will be
Dan Faehndrich, who
received 563 votes and
ran unopposed. He will
take a year’s sabbatical,
as ICSMSU President
is a full-time, paid role.
RCSU President will be
Michael McGill, RSMU
President will be Marta
Wolinska, and City and
Guild College Union
(CGCU) President will be
Andrew Hill.
This year’s Leadership
Elections saw an overall
turnout of 35.65%, down
from last year’s turnout of
36.79%. A spokesperson
from Imperial College
Union told Felix: “We’re
proud to have maintained
our place as the most
democratic students’
union in England &
Wales, and we’re grateful
to the 1000+ candidates
and 6500+ voters who
took part. Congratulations
to all the winners – we
look forward to working
together to improve the
lives of Imperial stu-
dents.”
“Additionally, we
acknowledge there were
issues with the support
and communication we
offered to candidates
throughout. We are
listening to the feedback
we have received from all
involved, and will offer
further opportunities for
participants to give their
views; we will learn from
this in order to improve
elections in future”
part of a transition phase
beginning in April 2019.
Independent experts
would also have been
called in to evaluate
the size of the pension
deficit, which Universities
UK claims is around £6
billion.
Following feedback
from UCU members,
however, the deal was
rejected. It was deemed
“insufficient” and “far
worse than anything that
members could consider
accepting”. One UCU
member, who has pre-
viously spoken to Felix
about the strikes, said:
“There have been mixed
feelings in the UCU. We
would love to return to
our jobs but the deal on
offer was truly terrible.
“The point of the strikes
was to keep the defined
benefits pension scheme.
All this deal offers is a
transitional three years –
during which we pay more
to receive less – while the
defined benefits scheme is
phased out,” they added.
In a statement Dr
Michael McGarvey,
president of Imperial
UCU, said: “Under
intense pressure from
senior management of
universities around the
country, UUK stated it
would like to meet with
UCU as soon as possible.
We now expect UUK to
come back with a serious
offer that staff can accept
which leads to an end to
the dispute.”
He added: “We hope
members of UUK,
including Imperial
College, will finally act
responsibly and help to
resolve the dispute by
stopping their attempts to
destroy the value of our
pensions for the sake of
the students and staff at
our universities.”
If no agreement is
reached, 14 days of further
strikes will go ahead
between April and June.
Dates have not yet been
decided but strikes are
expected to be organised
around exams in order to
maximise impact.
If a fresh deal is
reached, UCU members
hope to be given more
time to look over the
proposals – rather than
having to hold emergency
meetings in the street, as
was the case at Imperial.
“We’ve been disap-
pointed in both UUK and
UCU in their communica-
tions with members,” said
Felix’s UCU source. “We
hope any future detail
is communicated with
enough detail and time to
consider carefully before
a national vote.”
The Imperial UCU
Twitteraccountannounced
the postponement of “Not
the President’s Address”.
A UCU-sponsored event
is planned for the near
future.
