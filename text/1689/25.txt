ICXCAC – overtakes and underpasses
S
unday 11th
March
saw the intrepid
ICXCAC runners
head to the deso-
late wasteland of Milton
Keynes for its annual
festival of running. With
the majority of the team
choosing to tackle the
half-marathon distance,
and a couple opting for
the more manageable
10K, they all met at the
reasonably early time of
7:30am on the concourse
of Euston station.
Upon arrival in Milton
Keynes the athletes first
had to come to terms
with the vast number
of roundabouts in this
derelict ghost town. After
a reasonably lengthy walk
to the start line by the
spaceship-like ski centre,
the squad began the usual
pre-race ritual involving
team photos, toilet trips,
and warm-ups. Before
long, the start line was
awash with the red and
navy of Imperial vests.
The course included
weather conditions and
solid tarmac compared to
the club’s usual terrain of
mud and grass meant that
this was a fast race.
A particularly nifty
start was made by Kirill
Mikhaylov and Fergus
Johnson which saw them
lead the field of over 1400
runners for the first 200m
before settling into the
lead pack of around ten.
For many of the
ICXCAC runners,
this was their first half
marathon race, and for
others it was the furthest
they had ever run! This
made the resulting times
even more impressive.
Special mentions go to
Leanne Lyons for leaving
her race shoes on the bus
on the way there, Kirill
Mikhaylov for coming
first Imperial male and 7th
Overall in 1:18:04 after
an athlete’s breakfast of
three doughnuts, a “pastry
swirly thing” and several
own-brand energy drinks
from a discount supermar-
ket.
Shoutouts also go
to Thibault Audic for
throwing up twice and
still having an insane
sprint finish, Alex Stu-
art-Smith for an amazing
PB of 1:32, and finally
Liv Papaioannou for her
support and brownies.
After the race, the ex-
haustion was offset by the
weighty medal waiting at
the finish line. Following
some recovery by lying on
the floor, the team enjoyed
spectating strangers – the
race numbers had the
runner’s names on which
added an extra level of
humour.
The team then went
for a cheeky Wagas with
the chaps before leaving
MK to return to the me-
tropolis. Rumour has it
some of the team are still
having nightmares about
the copious amounts of
underpasses along the
race route…
Many thanks to
Women’s Captain Anna
for organising the trip.
ICXCAC (again!) – beasts from the South-East
O
n Wednesday
7th
March,
18 ICXCAC
athletes em-
barked on a journey to
running mecca – Iffley
Road track in Oxford. It
was on this hallowed turf
in 1954 that the late Sir
Roger Bannister broke the
four-minute mile for the
first time, and where the
Imperial athletes would
take part in the 2018
Teddy Hall Relays.
The triumphant day-out
began with the team
congregating in Beit Quad
before taking a brisk
walk through Hyde Park
to catch the Oxford Tube
from Notting Hill (other
bus services are availa-
ble). Straight to the back
of the top deck, it proved
to be a buzzing bus ride
full of pre-race optimism,
eVoting, and breath-tak-
ing scenery including
multiple sharks – one of
which was embedded in
somebody’s roof.
They soon left the
bus and strolled to Iffley
track to be greeted by
many other athletes from
universities and running
clubs listening to loud,
upbeat Indie music. The
flat, scenic course was
approximately 7km and
ran along the towpath and
through Christ Church
Meadow. Imperial’s squad
consisted of two Men’s
teams and two Mixed
teams consisting of four
runners, and one Women’s
team consisting of three
runners, with each runner
completing one leg each.
After a swift team al-
location, a short briefing,
and a minute’s silence
for Sir Bannister, it was a
flying start to Teddy Halls
for the athletes.
Chris Olley immediate-
ly took charge pushing on
to run the fastest leg of the
day (20:46 – 30 seconds
ahead of 2nd
!) as part
of the “Imperial Mixed
A” Team. He passed the
baton onto Sarah Johnson
(25:16) who proved to
be the 2nd
fastest female
of the day. Followed by
strong contributions from
Alex Mundell (29:47) and
Kirill Mikhaylov (24:33),
they finished with a silver
medal as the 2nd
Mixed
Team overall. An impres-
sive first leg from Fergus
Johnson (24:12), followed
by Jack McKeon (25:30),
Men’s Captain Lewis
Jackson (25:18) and an
energetic finish from
Duncan Hunter (25:21)
propelled “Imperial Men’s
A” to 9th
overall.
It was a strong perfor-
mance by the “Beasts from
the South East”: Henry
Maynard (27:52), Chew
Yi Heng (27:52), Ian
Napier (27:12) and Alex
Baldwin (28:15), who
finished 27th
. “Imperial
Women’s A” comprised
of Jenny Lea (31:09),
Wendy Lu Chen (35:35)
and Anna Fleming (33:28)
and continued the success
finishing 11th
overall.
Finally, Heinrich Hummel
(27:27) and Maryna
Voloshyna (36:58) drove
the baton round for “Hyde
Park Gilets” (who finished
12th
Mixed Team), before
handing it to Fergus
Johnson and Jack McKeon
to run their second legs
of the day. They deserve
major kudos.
After soaking up the
bustling atmosphere and
a quick shower, the squad
wandered back through
Oxford to St Edmund
Hall for a post-race
celebration and result
announcements. There
was an interesting yet
vast array of sandwiches
ranging from lemon curd
to cheese and pickle,
cake, fruit, and drinks.
Deservedly, the Imperial
athletes continued their
carb overload in the local
Wetherspoons before a
late return to London for
a much needed rest.

T
he City Varsity™
II,heldlastFriday
at Rosslyn Park,
was the second
annual varsity match
between Imperial College
London and London
School of Economics.
This promised to be an
exciting match and, after
months of hype, lived
up to expectations. The
match kicked off and im-
mediately proved to be a
very physical game, with
big collisions coming in
from both sides. Early
pressure and a dominant
pack from Imperial led
to LSE making mistakes,
giving Imperial the
chance to counter-attack
a couple of times. Perhaps
too eager to stop LSE
behind the game line in
defence, Imperial gave
away a penalty for offside
and allowed LSE’s kicker
to make the score 0-3.
off for many phases, but
quick recycling of the ball
and a missed tackle from
Imperial allowed LSE
to score under the posts.
Imperial were down 0-10
early in the game. Imperial
responded strongly and
started attacking out wide
through Oliver Duffy,
Kieran McMorran and
Hugo Koide. McMorran
was stopped just short of
the line, only for Jerome
Hallett to bundle over in
the next phase for a try.
James Field successfully
converted from afar, using
the wind to curl the ball
between the uprights – his
hard work during Harry
Allingham’s free kicking
lessons clearly paying off.
7-10 to LSE at half time.
Imperial began the
second half determined to
score first and take control
of the match. Weak penal-
ties from Imperial allowed
LSE to exert some attack-
ing pressure and they were
soon awarded a penalty
deep in the Imperial half.
This was kicked to make
the score 7-13. Field made
the kick off contestable,
but a mistimed tackle in
the air from Will Ainsley
resulted in him being
sent to the sin bin for 10
minutes to contemplate
his actions. Imperial did
not let their heads drop
and gave everything in
defence, with the usual
suspects Martin Head and
Toby Daniels making lots
of tackles.
Reckless Ainsley was
eventually, reluctantly,
invited back onto the pitch
by the referee and Imperial
were back to 15 men. This
was an opportunity to get
back into the game, and
quick play between the
forwards gave Imperial
attacking territory. Field
broke LSE’s line and at-
tempted to offload to Nick
Ustaran-Anderegg (who
would definitely have
outpaced the fullback
and scored), but alas this
was intercepted. Imperial
scrambled in defence
as LSE counterattacked
and prevented them from
scoring. Keen to uphold
Quigley and prop Amin
Omarouayache were
brought on to open up
the game more in attack.
Imperial now started to
look more threatening and
a 30m break from Quigley
almost resulted in a try.
Now back on the pitch,
Duffy showed everyone
what Imperial had been
missing by beating his
man on the outside…
and then kicking the ball
straightintotouch.Despite
leaving everything on the
pitch, Imperial’s efforts
did not eventually mate-
rialise into points, and the
match ended 7-16 with
LSE crowned champions
of The City Varsity™ II.
Thank you to everyone
who was involved or-
ganising and/or running
The City Varsity™ II, we
could not have done it
without you.
Despite very physical rugby and some great plays, our Imperial team is still hungry for a win in the City Varsity.
Chin up and eyes looking forward to claiming the title next year!
