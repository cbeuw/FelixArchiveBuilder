The acts for Summer Ball 2018 have been announced, completing plans
for an amazing end-of-year celebration on 23 June. Headlining the event
are Blonde and James Hype, with support from Gemma Cairney and
Goldierocks. The After Party performer is Guilty Pleasures.
Summer Ball is an annual celebration for all year groups with a free fun
fair, fireworks display, photobooth, great value food and drinks, and a
roster of performers including student groups and headline acts.
The theme for this year’s ball is Roaring 20s which was decided by
students in a Facebook poll.
Summer Ball 2018 starts at 19:00 and runs until 02:00 on South
Kensington Campus, with an after party at Beit Quad until 06:00.
