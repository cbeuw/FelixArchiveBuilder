In defence of video game walkthroughs

W
ith the
advent of
video games
and the in-
ternet also came the onset
of walkthroughs, guides
which tell you how to play
a game and get through
the story. They can vary in
complexity, from telling
you only the main points
of what to do, to literally
spelling out how to cover
every little corner. This is
something which pisses
off a lot of gamers and is
a source of endless debate
and discussion.
In their defence, people
who hate walkthroughs
are coming from an under-
standable place. The point
of a game is to immerse
yourself in another world.
You get involved in a
story, learn to master the
controls and gameplay
and in turn, get to expe-
rience the joy of working
things out and finding
interesting discoveries by
yourself. Easter eggs can
be considered as nice little
rewards for the hardcore
gamers who go all out and
try and get everything they
can out of a game. They
may feel like it’s some-
thing they’ve earned for
getting so invested in the
game. When other people
essentially use a manual
and get those trinkets for
hardly any work, it can
seem like the other people
didn’t really “deserve” the
prize by comparison.
Complicating the issue
is that games, unlike other
forms of non-interactive
media, require the player
to act in certain ways in
order to proceed through
the experience. When
you listen to a song, all
you have to do is listen;
only the music actually
stopping will affect your
ability to listen to it. A
video game, however,
only really progresses in
the way you’re able to
play it.
In addition to this,
people play games for all
kinds of reasons and to
some, I’m sure, playing a
game in any way besides
“optimally” feels like a
waste of time. There are
plenty of games that have
“miss-ables”, which are
lengthy game just to hit
a few more side quests or
recruit certain characters.
While there are some
notable exceptions, not
doing them shouldn’t
make it seem like your
play-through was an “in-
complete” experience.
The biggest reason as to
why people resort to using
game guides are because
of the time investment
games require. Most of
us aren’t teenagers with
all the time in the world.
As we get older and go
further through life, we
get more commitments;
as students, we have
reports, problems sheets
and assignments to catch
up amongst other things.
As can be expected, this
means there are fewer
and fewer opportunities to
play games.
Some games are also
long, complex and require
hours of investment to
get through. While this is
arguablypartofthefunand
experience, some people
get more enjoyment from
actually doing something
than wandering around
aimlessly and hoping that
they stumble on the way
forward. That’s just how
some games are designed;
given that, it’s no wonder
people use walkthroughts
to speed things along. For
other people, using walk-
throughs is just another
way to get through their
Steam library as fast as
they can. That’s what I’m
personally guilty of doing,
I blame all the great value
Steam sales that just keep
on coming.
Of course, walk-
throughs aren’t the only
way to get out if you get
stuck. A simple set of
actions like pausing the
game, doubling back a
little and working your
way through can be more
productive than you might
think. And sometimes,
all you need to do is to
turn off the game, sleep
on it, and come back to
the problem with a fresh
mind.
At the end of the day,
I’d say that as a player,
you should simply engage
in some introspection
about how you personally
experience things, about
how your brain digests
experiences, and then
decide from there how
playing certain games
would best suit your
tastes. Because honestly,
while it may seem like
there’s only one way to
play a game, such as going
in blind and learning
things for yourselves, you
should ultimately do what
seems the best for you.
We all just want to get the
best possible gaming ex-
perience from each game.
Sure some people may
denounce walkthroughs,
but at the end of the day,
they just help people
enjoy and get through the
game in their own way.
And as long as everyone
is having fun, who are we
to really complain.

something”
