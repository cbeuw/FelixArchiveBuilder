x c i t e m e n t ,
honour and grati-
tude. This is what
we, ICUTKD,
experienced last weekend
at the BSTF Student
Taekwondo National
Championships. Not only
did we bring eight golds,
six silvers and eight
bronze medals home,
but many other surprises
awaited us.
Friday, 9th
of March.
Half past four in the
afternoon. After a day of
lectures, we were ready
for a five-hour trip to
Worcester, or that was
what we thought. It did
not take long until all of us
fell asleep in the minibus.
Certainly, it had been a
long week of training and
deadlines.
In the morning of the
competition, there was
much to look forward
to. However, this time
the tournament was not
the only cause, but more
importantly our reunion
with Ilias Konstantinou,
our former ICUTKD
secretary, who moved out
last term. In spite of the
distance, he has continued
supporting, aiding and
taking care of us. At the

a small team,
but you can

we will grow
stronger and

year and reach
new heights”
the club.
The remaining
morning, time flew by
between rounds and
rounds of poomsae, the
pattern discipline of this
martial art. A noteworthy
effort of participants and
instructors led to a total
of four gold, one silver,
and three bronze medals
in Individual Patterns
and Freestyle, obtained
by: Junling Ong (A-class
Freestyle), Bryan Chong
(A-classIndividual),Huey
Shan Tey and Joon-Ho
Son (B-class Individual)
-gold-; Menghan Liu
(B-class Individual)
-silver- and Junling Ong,
Wenbo Chen (A-class
Individual); Andrew
Bates (C-class Individual)
-bronze- and Cynthia Ho,
who got 5th place out of
28 competitors. Moreover,
all our poomsae pairs/
teams climbed the
podium, achieving one
gold (Junling and Bryan,
A-class), two silvers
(Huey Shan and Joon-Ho,
B-class and Andrew and
Pilar Zhang, C-class) and
one bronze (Fatima Khan,
Angela Sun and Wenbo,
A-class). All these results
led ICUTKD to become
the National Student
Poomsae Champions,
with the best team within
UK in this category.
However, our thirst for
battle didn´t end there.
The following day –
Sunday, 11th
– our sparring
competitors joined us. We
couldn´t lose, we wanted
to meet the expectations
of our instructors and
coaches, to make them
proud. And so we did.
Our fighters did not give
up and fought until the
referee announced the Bryan Chong brandishing his Master Suh award, a truly
great accomplishment // ICUTKD

is not about
the belt or the
medals, but
about what
you learn and
take away
from it”
and Angela Sun (A-class),
Ilias Konstantinou,
Sophia Ppali (B-class) and
Jennifer Wang (C-class)
for bronze.
At the end of Nationals,
the overall UK Student
Taekwondo rankings
were released. Our team
came 2nd
overall in UK,
beating teams of more
than twice our size, and
most importantly: 1st
in
the Indomitable ranking.
The latter evaluates points
per player, which is a
better measurement of a
team’s quality.
Prominent amongst
these is the Master Suh
award, with which our
Vice-Chair – Bryan
Chong – was honoured
for his exceptional and
continuous service to the
British Student Taekwon-
do Federation (BSTF) this
year. We are proud and
thrilled to see his hard
work being recognised.
Not only is he a tireless
Vice-president and Taek-
wondo Ambassador but is
always looking after our
club members.
But of course, achiev-
ing 2nd
place in the UK
overall ranking and
becoming UK Poomsae
and Indomitable Cham-
pions would never have
been possible without all
end of the day, Taekwon-
do is not about the belt
or the medals, but about
what you learn and take
away from it. For me, that
is the sense of family in
our instructors, coaches,
alumni and members. We
might be a small team,
but you can be certain that
we will grow stronger and
stronger each year and
reach new heights.

end of the game. Not
even technical issues
stopped us. Just ask Huey
Shan, who had to fight
her final twice, emerging
victorious each time. Nev-
ertheless, she was not the
only one to win gold. A
total of three golds, three
silvers and four bronzes
were achieved in total.
These were awarded to:
Simonne Griffith-Jones,
Sojin Park (A-class) and
Huey Shan Tey (B-class)
for gold; Wenbo Chen
(A-class), Menghan Liu
(B-class) and Sharmila
Rana (C-class) for silver;
