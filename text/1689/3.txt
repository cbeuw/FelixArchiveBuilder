a number of recommenda-
tions, including creation
of a senior management
position responsible for
“integrating equality and
diversity provision within
the institution”.
Felix investigates sexism at Imperial
“There are a lot of
challenges there, and
no overnight solutions,”
Professor Curry told Felix
“Much of the ongoing
work is trying to change
the culture, and needs a
lot of conversations with
people.” While there have
been a number of schemes
initiated since the ICR
– increased diversity
training, signing up to the
Race Equality Charter,
and integration of equali-
ty, diversity, and inclusion
within the new Learning
and Teaching Strategy
– Professor Curry said:
“Clearly it’s a job not just
for two or three years, but
a job for the next 10-20
years. Imperial is embed-
ded within a society that
is deeply unequal in many
ways. We want to be more
proactive in trying to
tackle that.”
This special report
looks at the experiences of
women across all aspects
of Imperial life – from un-
dergraduates, to academ-
ics, to clubs and societies,
and finally to the issue of
sexual harassment and
violence – to see how far
we’ve come over the past
few years, and how far we
still have to go.

"Since coming to Imperial, I've always felt an undercurrent of sexism" – students speak out

75% of women
surveyed had faced
derogatory comments
whileatImperial,from
sexual harassment to
saying they can't do
science.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
O
ver half of the
female under-
graduates who
completed the
survey reported having
experienced misogyny
as part of their studies,
and just over 40% of all
respondents reported
having witnessed it. A
quarter of the women
who responded also said
they had experienced
bullying or harassment
due to their gender.
The vast majority of
these experiences, based
on reports obtained
through the survey, were
derogatory comments
from the individual’s
own peer group: over
75% of women said they
had experienced peers
making such comments
during their time at
Imperial, the majority of
which involved sexual-
ised language or belittling
comments about their
ability.
One student told Felix:
“I can’t even begin to
count the number of times
derogatory comments
have been made about
myself and other female
students. The constant
objectification, judgement
of our clothes and actions,
and being constantly
referred to as bitches,
sluts, or whores… every
time I call out a man on
their use of derogatory
language they laugh it off
as harmless.”
Other students were
accused of swapping
sexual favours in ex-
change for good grades:
one women was asked
whether she was sleeping
with a teaching assistant
to get a good mark on her
report, while another told
Felix: “I was told I must
have given the assessor
a handjob under the desk
because I did better than a
male peer in a viva assess-
ment.”
Many said they found it
difficult to call out sexist
language, with a number
of women saying they
were called “over-sensi-
tive” or accused of “over-
reacting” when they chal-
lenged such comments.
Three-fifths of the women
surveyed said they had
experienced derogatory
comments about women
being left unchallenged.
Professor Curry
admits it is “impossible
for College to police
every single interaction
that happens between
students”, but says “every
member of the College
community has a respon-
sibility for appropriate
behaviour on campus”.
One intervention he
feels can lead to tangible
change is the introduction
of Active Bystander
Training, which has been
rolled out to a number of
departments, and some
key volunteers within
ICU. The training, which
teaches people to confront
discriminatory behaviour,
“is quite an effective way
to start a conversation, to
make sure more people
are primed and equipped
[to call out sexism]”.
He also highlighted the
importance of codifying
standards of behaviour
from a student’s first day
at Imperial: “We have
to send out a very clear
message at the beginning,
saying we expect these
standards of behaviour. In
our Department [of Life
Sciences] we have intro-
duced lectures for freshers
talking about respect, the
Equality Act, what har-
assment means. It’s about
trying to build a culture
where it doesn’t matter
who you are, you’re
welcome here, and you’ll
be treated with respect.
Katie*, a final year
student in the Faculty of
Engineering, told Felix
she’d experienced sexism
since arriving as a fresher:
“Since coming to Impe-
rial, I’ve always felt an
undercurrent of sexism.
It started in first year,
walking past a male sports
team at sports night – I was
catcalled and looked up
and down so fiercely that I
felt exposed. This became
a regular occurrence at
almost every sports night.
Casual sexism disguised
as jokes and ‘lad banter’
has always been rife, so
much so that even the
women here have accept-
ed and often go along with
it – including myself as a
naïve fresher, wanting to
fit in.”
Katie also highlighted
the difficulty in speaking
out, but said it could also
be due to intimidation
women on campus feel.
She described a number of
incidents within the Royal
School of Mines (RSM),
including slut-shaming,
derogatory chanting, and
sexist behaviour by the
‘Chaps Club’ – one of
Imperial’s ‘Tie Clubs’,
which serves as a society
for current and former
members of Royal School
of Mines Union (RSMU).
“We were told not to
complain about sexist
comments to ICU, since
it would make our de-
partment ‘look bad’, and
when one of my friends
wanted to make a com-
plaint about the Chaps we
were told we had to take it
up directly with them. It’s
intimidating for a woman
to speak to a large group
of older men about their
behaviour, and so she did
not make the complaint.
It’s hard as a woman to
speak out about sexism
through fear of becoming
isolated, or receiving a
backlash from peers for
making a complaint”.
Robert Tomkies, the
current RSMU President
and ICU's President-elect,
is aware of the challenges
faced by women within
the RSMU. He told Felix:
“In the RSMU this year
we have placed gender
equality and inclusivity at
the forefront of our prior-
ities.” RSMU has identi-
fied a number of outdated
traditions and sought to
change them: a number
of the old chants were
retired, and new chants
selected in the run-up to
this year’s Bottle Match;
people singing the old
chants were identified and
told to stop. Tomkies also
cited a number of other
concerning traditions that
had been identified, such
as the “President’s Yard’,
which was previously
done on stage in under-
wear, and has since been
removed.
Regarding problems
students had with coming
forward, RSMU put in
place anonymous surveys
at the beginning of this
academic year asking for
feedback, and has since
established an online inci-
dent form, where students
can submit reports. They
have secured funding for
active bystander training
for all key volunteers
within the RSMU – in-
cluding sports captains
– and are looking into
ways to prevent sexist in-
dividuals from attending
RSMU events.
Tomkies told Felix:
“Tackling these issues
will take a continued drive
from the RSMU over
several years, but this
year’s committee is proud
to have been part of those
steps. Culture change
cannot happen overnight,
but RSMU has started a
change that lays strong
foundations for greater
inclusivity in the future.”
A representative of
ICU told Felix: “These
figures are very concern-
ing. Misogynistic and
discriminatory behaviour
is simply not acceptable
in any form to Imperial
College Union, and that
applies equally to all of
our social spaces, student
activities and events. We
have trained our staff and
student leaders in how to
be ‘active bystanders’ and
our professional staff deal
swiftly with any incidents
that take place within our
bars and events.
We are working with
College on the response
to the Institutional Culture
Review, and we acknowl-
edge that we have work
to do ourselves, to make
clear to our members
and volunteers that such
behaviour is not welcome
within the Imperial
College Union communi-
ty”
Women in STEM
Another significant
theme that emerged from
the survey was hostility
faced by female students
who were often told
they should not be at
Imperial. Overall, 38%
of women had been told
they couldn’t or shouldn’t
do STEM subjects, with
many students reporting
being told they did not
deserve to be there.
As well as comments
about natural abilities
– “women shouldn’t do
engineering”, “women
aren’t as good as men at
hard sciences” – women
reported being told posi-
tive discrimination or the
use of quotas had made
their time at university
easier. “You only got an
offer because you’re a
girl”, was one comment
reported in the survey,
while “companies only
hire female engineers to
fill a quota” was another.
Serena*, a fresher
in the Faculty of Engi-
neering, reported similar
experiences, saying she
felt more pressure to do
well at her subject as a
result: “If a guy fails, they
fail because they’ve not
studied hard enough, but
if a woman fails, it’s seen
as being because she’s a
woman. The reasoning
completely changes.”
One aspect of Imperial
life that can increase
the visibility of women
students is the infamous
‘Imperial ratio’ – used to
describe the relative lack
of female undergraduates
compared to their male
counterparts. This year,
men made up over two
thirds of the total cohort,
with 730 male applicants
placed, compared to 335
women, giving a ratio
of roughly 70:30 men to
women. This figure varies
greatly between depart-
ments and years.
While some respond-
ents described such
language as “banter”,
others highlighted the
impact it can have. “It
makes me feel like I
shouldn’t be there”, said
one student, while another
said it “encourages the
continuation of a mindset,
even if it’s claimed in
jest”. Some respondents
said such comments had
a cumulative impact on
them during their time at
Imperial: “I’m treated as
less deserving of the job
because I am a woman,”
one said. “It tends not to
be major, but just consist-
ently every day – it chips
you down.”
Serena talked to Felix
about her experience:
“I think the biggest
issue with misogyny is
with my peers. Some-
times they will joke, like
when we’re doing coding,
they’ll say ‘oh girls don’t
know how to code’. It’s
discouraging – you’re just
trying to do your work,
and then these comments
pop up. Even though it’s
claimed to be done as a
joke, or it’s subtle, I think
it’s a reflection of how
they really feel about
women, deep down.”
Some departments
have created networks for
women to support each
other on campus: students
from the Electrical and
Electronic Engineering
(EEE) Department, for
example, recently set up a
society for women within
the department, which
they said they hoped
would “bring together
an active community of
women in EEE”. Such
initiatives to improve the
experience of women in
STEM have been adopted
at higher levels within the
College – the Juno Com-
mittee in the Department
of Physics, for example,
aims to address under-rep-
resentation of women,
while Imperial has been
awarded an Athena
SWAN Silver award for
commitment to advancing
women in academia.
While such moves
may address the un-
dercurrents of sexism,
they have been met with
pushback from a number
of students and staff,
both male and female.
One female respondent
said: “Women at Imperial
should not receive any
extra support – financially
or emotionally. We should
be made equal to men in
every way [otherwise] we
look incapable.” Another
said they believed the
main source of discrimi-
nation was against white
middle-class men – a view
echoed by a number of
staff members who took
our survey.
James*, an undergrad-
uate aeronautics student,
told Felix he felt positive
discriminationwasamajor
feature of the Faculty of
Engineering: “You see all
these posters promoting
women in engineering,
and there are a number of
bursaries or funds that are
only open to women, but
no such schemes apply for
men. Are the women here
to fulfill quotas? Argua-
bly, yes. Their technical
ability seems to be lower
[than the men], and abil-
ity-wise, a larger number
of women in engineering
don’t know what they’re
doing.”
Professor Curry told
Felix the College needed
to “push back against
[these ideas] even harder,
because it’s a ridiculous
proposition”. He says
only 17% of professors
at Imperial are women,
and “if you’re going to
argue the best people are
at the top, that’s mani-
festly not true. That view
comes from people who
mostly function within
their in-group, where they
reinforce prejudices and
biases”.
He says the idea
women get lower offers is
a presumption: “There is
no evidence for it. No de-
partment has a policy that
admits women on lower
ratings.” While quotas
in recruitment are not
allowed in law, he says
“departments are charged
to make sure they are pro-
active about encouraging
under-represented groups
to apply.” While the
College “will still appoint
the best candidate every
time”, increasing the pool
of applicants will mean
“there is a diverse field of
candidates.” He remains
optimistic for the future:
“I think that is a position
that is untenable, that is
losing ground, and I think
we are seeing a shift.”
