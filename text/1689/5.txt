Lack of support is a concern for many when it comes to reporting sexual violence and harassment
NEWS
Students report not
knowing where to
go if they've been
the victim of sexual
assault or harassment
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
S
usan* had just
started her third
year at Imperial
when she was
sexually assaulted by a
staff member, on a night
out that had been ar-
ranged for students. “At
first, when he came out
with us, I was thinking
‘does anyone else find
that a bit weird?’” she
told Felix. “He gave me
a hug, then another, and
another all in quick suc-
cession. It made me feel
incredibly uncomforta-
ble, and I decided not to
talk to him for the rest of
the evening.” However,
the staff member contin-
ued to come up to Susan
throughout the night,
despite the fact she had
made it clear she didn’t
want to spend time with
him: “He came up to me
and started chatting, so
I just went back inside,
but he found me again,
and commented on my
breasts.”
Later on in the evening,
when the group had
moved on to a different
venue, Susan and the staff
member ended up near
each other at the bar: “He
kept asking me what I
wanted to drink, over and
over, so I turned away,
because I just didn’t want
to speak to him. He asked
‘why won’t you talk to
me? Why won’t you let
me buy you a drink?’And
then he grabbed my ass.”
Susan’s experience is
not an isolated incident
within higher education:
an investigation by the
Guardian, published
around a year ago, found
students in the UK had
made at least 169 allega-
tions of staff sexual mis-
conduct towards students,
including three incidents
at Imperial. The actual
number of incidents is
likely to be much higher;
Dr Ann Olivarius, a senior
partner at law firm McAl-
lister Olivarius, said these
results were “just the tip
of the iceberg”, while Dr
Anna Bull, co-founder of
the 1752 Group, which
aims to tackle sexual
misconduct in higher
education, said: “There is
evidence to suggest that
the actual figures in the
UK would be staggering.”
Susan chose not to
report the incident to the
College or the Union,
citing the pressure such
proceedings can have:
“If something happens to
him, if he loses his job,
does that become my
responsibility? And then
all of these proceedings
are fairly uncomfortable
to go through. Already
when these kind of things
happen you think you’re
in the wrong, and then
having to explain what
happened to someone else
is just horrible. It’s just
such a difficult thing to
do.”
higher education. One
is to “implement an en-
forceable national code
of conduct that clarifies
professional boundaries”:
the group says students
are often “unsure what
behaviour is acceptable”
from staff members,
due to “blurred lines
around the professional
relationship between staff
and students.” This is
something Susan found
in her experience: “All
these things are grey
areas – I’ve been to drinks
for research groups, and
that sort of thing, because
it’s a work setting, but
we need to draw clear
lines. Even though we are
both adults, he’s still in
a position of power over
students, and that kind
of behaviour – going out
with students – is wrong.
But it’s not advertised as
being wrong – nowhere at
Imperial.”
“If you are assaulted
at university, then it is a
university issue. I don’t
think I’ve seen anything
at Imperial saying ‘if a
staff member does this
you need to report it’. And
that’s quite an astonishing
oversight.”
These concerns over
the ability to handle sexual
misconduct were echoed
by a number of women
Felix spoke to, with one
postdoc saying: “UK uni-
versities do not have the
policies to be able to cope
with [staff-student sexual
harassment and bullying]
at the moment – and that’s
quite frightening.”
While Susan does not
have classes with the man
who assaulted her, she
still has to see him in the
department occasionally –
something which greatly
affects her: “I’ve seen
him, and he’s made eye
contact with me and said
hello. I just feel so uncom-
fortable and nervous, and
I just don’t want to say
anything back.”
affects women dispro-
portionately”. While this
violence does not neces-
sarily need to be sexual,
the majority of reports
Felix obtained through the
survey related to sexual
assault and rape.
Theactualproportionof
students who have experi-
enced sexual assault may
well be higher: one NUS
report suggests that one
in four female students
across the UK has been
sexually assaulted, with
far more facing sexual
harassment. The College,
on its website, says it is
“committed to promoting
a university environment
where everyone feels safe,
supported, and respected”,
while ICU’s Safe Space
Policy aims to “create
an environment in our
venues that all students,
staff and visitors feel safe,
happy and protected in.”
Unfortunately, a
number of those who
filled in our survey did
not feel safe on campus:
“I have been harassed
by unknown men whilst
going about my everyday
life since puberty,” wrote
one respondent. “It was
only when I arrived at
Imperial that I began to
face harassment from
my peers… I have been
touched, grabbed, and
mauled without consent.
I have felt frightened and
scared of being raped. I
rarely felt that any of my
male peers respected me
as an equal human being.”
The Union building
seems to be a hotspot for
sexual violence, particu-
larly at events like ACC
Night. “If ‘gender-based
violence’ includes minor
sexual assault – slaps
on the bum, that sort of
thing – then it’s certainly
something that happens
on a regular night in
the Union,” wrote one
respondent, while others
reported being groped in
568 or sexually harassed
in Metric. One respondent
said the Union Bar was
where she had experi-
enced the most derogatory
comments and the great-
est number of threats of
sexual violence.
only 8.7% of respondents
said they would report
a sexual assault to ICU,
citing concerns about the
incident being treated as
minor, or fear they would
be blamed or not taken
seriously.
Some women who
had reported their cases
said they were not sat-
isfied with the results:
one woman, who had
been raped, told Felix:
“College did nothing, nor
did the Union. That was
only one of a number of
cases I believe have been
swept under the carpet.”
Another, who was raped
by another student whilst
unconscious after a night
out, said the College
had not been helpful: “I
was advised that if I was
unsuccessful with the
police that I would have
to see them on campus
every day, and that it
would simply make my
university experience
more difficult. Imperial’s
culture of protecting stu-
dents’ reputations above
wellbeing is partially
responsible for this.”
Last term Felix reported
on the experience of one
alumna who had reported
her sexual assault to the
College and the Union;
the investigation took
more than seven months
to be completed, during
which time the victim was
passed between at least
six staff, and left unsup-
ported. “This experience
pushed me back into a sui-
cidal state,” she told Felix.
“Absurdly, the sexual
assault investigation was
more distressing that the
sexual assault itself.”
Another student said
she had never reported
incidents of sexual har-
assment “simply because
there is no clear channel
to do so…Imperial should
implement an easy to use,
online sexism and harass-
ment reporting tool”.
Others mention that ex-
isting services at Imperial
are not advertised. Susan,
prior to being assaulted
by the staff member, had
been sexually assaulted
on campus by a non-Im-
perial student, after being
emotionally manipulated
into going to an isolated
area with him. This time,
she reported it to campus
security: “They were
incredible. They took
me down to their office,
and made me feel so
comfortable. If you are
assaulted, you are under
no obligation to report
it – you’re so busy trying
to process what happened,
the thought of having to
explain it to someone else
is unthinkable – but the
security services were
fantastic.”
After taking a state-
ment from Susan, security
phoned the police with
her consent, and helped
to make a report. They
posted the perpetrator’s
face on the College’s se-
curity boards and shortly
after he was arrested while
leading another girl away
from the main campus.
With Susan’s consent, the
security services got in
touch with College tutors,
and helped her organise
mitigating circumstances.
She was also fast-tracked
into the College counsel-
ling service.
university campuses, and
the College is setting up
a working group to deal
with the issue. Professor
Curry told Felix it would
“look across the board at
staff and student experi-
ences, and come up with a
unified set of policies and
procedures that create a
credible reporting system,
so that staff and students
don’t feel like there is
nowhere to go”.
As well as the creation
of a more accessible re-
porting system, the group
should also clarify and
codify what behaviours
are considered acceptable
from academics – a topic
Professor Curry believes
academics are becoming
more aware of as a result
of increasing discourse.
One of the key chal-
lenges the working group
will face, Professor Curry
admits, is the issue of
communication: “There
are gaps, and in a large,
complex organisation
[like Imperial] there are
always going to be gaps,
or problems with com-
munication, which recent
cases have highlighted.
One important thing is to
make sure the students’
union and the College are
joined up in a way that
works for students.”
“It’s a big job to do,” he
says, “and it can’t be dis-
missed or brushed under
the carpet.”

“While Susan
does not
have classes
with the staff
member who
assaulted her,
she still has to
see him in the
department”
The 1752 Group has
a number of strategic
priorities, implementa-
tion of which would go
some ways to addressing
sexual misconduct in
“Some women
who reported
their cases said
they had not
been helped
by the College
or Union”
When women have
faced violence, many do
not feel confident about
reporting it to the College
or ICU. In a survey
organised by an Imperial
student earlier this year,
“One student
said she had
never reported
sexual
harassment
because 'there
is no clear
channel to do
so'”
“Reporting these kind
of things is one of the
hardest and most un-
thinkable things you can
consider in that situation.
However, there are ser-
vices to go to if you know
where they are on campus
– I would never have gone
to the Union with this, but
security were fantastic. If
you can report it, and you
feel like you can – it’s no
way an obligation – there
are things you can do.”
One of the reasons
Susan wanted to share
her experience was to let
people know there were
places they could go to for
help. Our survey found
that many respondents
are unaware of available
support: fewer than half
of respondents said they
knew where to go if they
were the victim of dis-
crimination or violence,
while only 22% of women
surveyed felt that the
College was doing enough
to provide support for
victims of discrimination.
The topic of sexual
misconduct has become
more prominent on
