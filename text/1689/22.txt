Pension dispute to be solved with Hunger Games
deathmatch
HANGMAN
Staff are split over
the potential of a
deathmatch to decide
who will get the
biggest pensions.
I
ndustrial action
organised by the
Universities and
College Union
(UCU) could be set
to end their strike this
week, after Universities
UK (UUK) brought a
new option for pension
plans to the discussion
table.
UUK, the governing
body for higher education
institutions in the UK,
last night announced
their new proposal for the
USS pension scheme: a
Hunger Games-inspired
competition in which
the strongest, quickest,
or wiliest academics and
support staff would walk
away with the largest
pension pots.
were “a fair way forward
for the future, ensuring the
deficit within the pension
fund is resolved, while
also making sure those
who remain behind at the
end of the competition
will be satisfied with their
provisions.”
“We have made it clear
that the current pension
scheme is unsustainable.
UCU have so far rejected
plans to reduce their
pension size, so now
we will have to reduce
the number of pensions
instead. Organising our
own Hunger Games
allows us to do just this.
Staff members who have
their pensions completely
cut at the end of the com-
petition will be unlikely to
complain. Since they will
be dead.”
Hangman has also
received exclusive
evidence that UUK are
currently in talks with
Channel 4 about having
the competition broadcast
live, with Carol Vorder-
man to host.
One academic seemed
of his career, said: “In the
build-up to this action,
they were saying those
who were the youngest
would be set to lose the
most from their fund.
In this new proposal,
however, my youth and
fitness will give me a huge
advantage over the others,
so I’m considering voting
for it.”
Others were less
pleased with the proposal:
“I would be up for some
kind of Crystal Maze
scenario, where we all go
into a dome and grab at
our pension funds, or even
some kind of Fort Boyard
thing, if they can find the
tigers,” one senior lec-
turer told Hangman, “but
taking it to Hunger Games
levels seems too extreme.
I would never be able to
turn against my fellow

staff. Except perhaps Jim
from the Space Physics
Group. He keeps using
my mug and not washing
it up.”
A spokesperson for
UCU told Hangman:
“This is a clear attempt
by UUK and university
senior management to
divide and conquer,
turning staff against each
other in a literal death-
match. UUK will need
to commit to much more
before we open this up to a
vote at our next meeting –
for example, they need to
let us know what kind of
weapons we will have in
this scenario, and whether
teams are allowed.”
In unrelated news, Im-
perial College Union Rifle
and Pistol society this
week saw a surge of staff
members asking to join.
“The strongest
academics
would walk
away with
the largest
pensions”
“UUK are
currently in
talks with
Channel
4 about
broadcasting”

Speaking to Hangman,

Department of Physics,
who is in the early stages

UUK, said the proposals

Death threats
dropped by 83% last
Sunday, as trolls took
time to post pictures
of their mothers on
Instagram.

M
en up and
down the
country last
w e e k e n d
took a break from issuing
death threats to women
on Twitter to wish their
mothers a happy Moth-
ering Sunday.
Women across Twitter
were startled and relieved
to find their mentions
free of vile misogyny or
threats of sexual violence.
One user, who goes by
the handle @manlyand-
proud, and has the Twitter
bio “classical liberal | hu-
manist | 52% | full brexit
now” told Hangman: “I
had just posted something
to Laura Kuenssberg
telling her to kill herself,
and was halfway through
drafting a tweet to Mary
Beard telling her why her
understanding ancient
Rome was completely
incorrect, when I realised
it was Mother’s Day. I
had to take a break from
my computer to give her a
ring, dig out an old photo,
and post it to Instagram
with the caption ‘to my
biggest inspiration’.”
Statistics from Twitter
showed the number of
active male users over
Sunday 11th March
dropped significantly,
with users such as Car-
oline Criado-Perez and
Gina Miller receiving
83% fewer tweets than
usual.
One woman user of
Twitter told Hangman:
“For about three hours
there was just a deadly
silence; it was quite
ominous really. I’m a
professor of particle
physics, and I was finally
able to have a proper,
constructive conversation
without a random man
coming into my mentions
and telling me how to do
my job or live my life.”
Normal Twitter service
resumed the next day.
Twitter representatives
apologised for the inter-
ruption.
Twitter was a nice place for approx. 3 hours // Twitter

to celebrate Mother’s Day
This week you lose out
in the student elections
to be an Officer Trustee.
Congrats, you missed a
bullet.
This week all the
computers crash in the
Felix office (again).
Luckily the wonderful
team still managed to get
the paper out. YOU’RE
WELCOME.
This week you celebrated
pi day by consuming a
whole chocolate fudge
pie in one sitting. I mean,
you would have done
it anyway, labs were
fucking stressful. At least
you had an excuse.
This week it’s AGM
season! You get blackout
drunk in the Union Bar
and wake up to find
yourself President of
Swiss Society.
This week you’re a male
student, and you manage
to complain about the
‘Imperial ratio’ and say
women shouldn’t do
STEM in the same breath.
Congrats, you played
yourself.
This week your lecturers
have spent far too long
on strike, and you’ve
forgotten how to degree.
This week you’re a
physicist, and you’re
sick of explaining the
difference between
cosmology, astrophysics,
and space physics in
the wake of Stephen
Hawking’s’ death.
This week you’re a
sabbatical officer, and
you’re finally free! The
curse has been passed on!
This week you’re still
upset about how the
elections were run. GET
OVER IT NOBODY
CARES.
This week you’re really
glad Felix is running their
sexism survey. Finally,
someone is focussing
on what really matters
to you: discrimination
against white middle
class men.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’ve only got to write
one more of these this
term. You really cba
though.
