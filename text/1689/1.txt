misogyny on campus.

A
Felix survey
on sexism at
Imperial Col-
lege London
has revealed a number
of concerns over the
treatment of female
students and staff across
multiple areas.
The survey, which ran
for six weeks, gathered
about 300 responses from
students, alumni, and
staff. Around two-thirds
of respondents identified
as female.
Just over 40% of
respondents had experi-
enced misogyny at Im-
perial, and over 70% had
experienced peers making
derogatory comments
about women.
While 80% of people
thought Imperial was an
inclusive place to work
or study, 30% thought
Imperial did not work
hard to make things more
inclusive, and just over
20% felt Imperial College
Union (ICU) did not do
enough for inclusivity.
Availability of support
seemed to be a particular
sticking point, with nearly
50% of people saying they
did not know where to go
if they were the victim of
discrimination, and only
30% agreeing that Impe-
rial did enough to support
victims of discrimination.
Felix spoke to Profes-
sor Stephen Curry, Assis-
tant Provost (Education,
Diversity, and Inclusion),
who entered his role in
October 2017, and will
hold the position for an
initial period of two years.
A professor of structural
biology for half of his
working week, he spends
the other half exploring
how Imperial can create
a more inclusive commu-
nity. He told Felix there
were a number of aspects
that led to the creation of
his role, which partially
developed out of the po-
sition of Provost’s Envoy
for Gender Equality:
changes within society
that have put inclusion
on the agenda; increased
awareness of the harass-
ment in higher education;
a greater appreciation
of the mental health of
students and staff; and
reflection on Imperial’s
Institutional Culture
Report (ICR).
The ICR, published
in December 2016, was
triggered by a number of
sexist incidents at Impe-
rial, and said the College
had a “sink-or-swim”
culture. It described an
“all-consuming focus on
academic performance”,
“bullying and discrimi-
natory behaviour towards
staff and students”, and
“‘ingrained misogyny’
so deep it had become
normal.”Itconcludedwith
