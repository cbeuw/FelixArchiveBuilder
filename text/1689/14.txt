I
have become quite
partial to Japanese
literature as a literary
category. Most ex-
amples share overarching
similarities in aesthetic
flavour, such as the notion
of impermanence of
being, which derive from
both cultural and religious
developments throughout
Japanese history. These
sensitivities, observable
in other Japanese art
forms such as ceramics
or paintings, result in a
characteristically sublime
writing style no matter
when it was written.
For example, works by
Chikamatsu Monzaemon,
a 17th
century playwright
who wrote canonical
pieces for Bunraku
(puppet theatre) and
Kabuki (live theatre) still
retain a certain freshness
and sophistication if read
today. This is not to say
that the authors write in
the same style, but rather
that the broader aesthetic
sensibilities and literary
traditions lend a certain
elegance.
I would recommend
Donald Keene’s The
Pleasure of Japanese
Literature for a more
comprehensive review
on the nexus of Japanese
history and aesthetics and
its impact on literature. A
commonality I particular-
ly enjoy is the emphasis
that these authors have
placed on the self, going to
great lengths to showcase
the personal: tensions,
passions and proclivities.
I felt this characteristic
has made many works
relatable, helping me to
crystallise and frame raw
thoughts and feelings.
Modern Japanese
literature uniquely
combines modernist and/
or post-modernist themes
with the Japanese aesthet-
ic, including its perspec-
tives and history, into a
powerful read. Renowned
authors like Natsume
Soseki and Ryonuske
Akutgawa are characteris-
tic of pre-WW2 literature,
incorporating modernist
themes and writing styles
in their prominent works
signifying the changing
zeitgeist.
Naturalised foreign
authors like Lafcaido
Hearn have also gained
some prominence, re-
flecting the increasing
diversity that came with
international trade and
migration. This period
also saw the development
of Japan’s first Nobel
laureate in Literature,
Yasunari Kawabata, who
received the prize in
1968. Post-war Japanese
literature saw several
other prominent authors
like Kobo Abe, Yukio
Mishima, and Kenzaburo
Oe (Japan’s 2nd
Nobel
laureate for literature)
who started to incorpo-
rate contemporary and
post-modern themes
and writing styles into a
Japanese context.
Even more contempo-
rary authors like Haruki
Murakami have been pro-
ducing outstanding pieces
of work (I quite liked
Hard-Boiled Wonderland
and the End of the World),
contributing to a flourish-
ing literary tradition.
Yasunari Kawabata’s
Beauty and Sadness
Kawabata edged out
Mishima for the Nobel
prize in literature in 1968.
He is best known for the
books Snow Country,
Thousand Cranes, and
The Old Capital amongst
others. Much of his work
skilfully combines the
intrinsic passions and
feelings people have in
our human (and particu-
larly in our romantic)
relationships, with the
cultural and socio-politi-
cal attitudes and tensions
of the time.
Beauty and Sadness,
while a nice short read, is
an excellent representa-
tion of Kawabata’s ability
to capture the nature of a
romantic passion between
two lovers and the conse-
quent tensions that exist in
the self and those around.
There are times when
his descriptions almost
enable you to vicariously
experience the depths of
such experiences.
It follows Otoko,
currently a renowned
painter and her youthful
but life-changing romance
with Oki, a much older
man. Their passionate
affair resulted in Otoko
having a stillborn child.
Kawabata artistically
shows the intrinsic
tensions that we have
during the peaks and
troughs of romance and
its failure; the sort of
romance that transcends
time and always lingers
in the back of your mind,
manifesting in every sigh
and chuckle.
Yukio Mishima’s The
Temple of the Golden
Pavilion
Mishima to date is
one of my favourite
Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion which is the subject of Mishima’s novel// Wikimedia
authors. His life story
is fascinating to say the
least and his writing is
thoroughly enjoyable and
thought-provoking.
A key theme present
in his work is the notion
of purity and beauty. The
Golden Pavilion (also
known as Kinkaku-ji) is
a famous Zen Buddhist
temple in Kyoto dating
back to the 14th
century.
Mishima presents a fic-
tionalised version of the
1950 incident when the
temple was burnt down by
a young monk.
We start with Mishima
outlining various forma-
tive experiences the pro-
tagonist, Mizoguchi, has
as a child. This is where
the notion of Kinkaku-ji
being the pinnacle of aes-
thetic ideals is implanted
into him. Following his
father’s death, Mizoguchi
becomes a novice priest
at Kinkaku-ji. As the
story progresses, we can
see how his thoughts
are shaped by his inner
tensions and his inter-
actions with a spectrum
of characters, such as
Kashiwagi (a twisted
university friend with a
philosophical bent) and
the temple’s Superior.
This results in a sublime
and nuanced discourse on
the nature of beauty and
how one interacts with
the concept. Mizoguchi
found himself impotent
as the idea of Kinkaku-ji
seized him. As his thought
process developed, or
arguably as his mental
illness worsened, the mo-
tivation to burn the temple
deepened, leading to its
eventual destruction with
Mizoguchi enjoying a cig-
arette as the temple burns.
The entire novel, while
complex in story, remains
accessible and serves as
an excellent introduction
to Mishima’s work and
Japanese literature as a
category.
