Ready player one – how games are fuelling ‘citizen
science’
Programs like FoldIt are using our enthusiasm for problem-solving to crowdsource solutions to scientific puzzles.

I
f you were told that
the next solution to
one of our endearing
medical and scientific
challenges may be coming
from a bunch of computer
gamers around the world,
your immediate reaction
will be one of disbelief.
Though it sounds sur-
prising, a computer game
called FoldIt has been a
beneficial tool in helping
scientist with solving
one of the most difficult
problems existing today
in science: identification
of the three-dimensional
structure of proteins from
their linear amino acid
sequences. The game uti-
lises the superior cognitive
ability of the human brain
in ‘pattern matching’ and
‘spatial reasoning’, then
uses machines to identify
the correct three-dimen-
sional structures of
proteins. In fact, this game
was exclusively designed
for this purpose by the
University of Washington
(UWash). Before FoldIt,
the scientists at UWash
were using general public
computer powers to solve
protein folding by com-
plex algorithms. However,
they realised that humans
have an ingenious imagi-
nation, which – if properly
used – can identify folded
structures of proteins
much better than com-
puters. They were right!
FoldIt was first launched
in 2008, and in 2010 a
Nature paper showed that
the results provided by
FoldIt players were far su-
perior to computer-based
results.
So, what is the
problem with protein
folding? Proteins in our
cells are microscopic
machines, responsible
for almost all our basic
functions ranging from
digestion to respiration,
excretion to movement.
Being machine-like,
their three-dimensional
structure is very important
for the functions they
perform. When unfolded
into two dimensions they
are merely a chain, strung
together by amino acids
in different sequences.
Knowing this sequence
and its biochemistry is
simple, but it is very dif-
ficult to identify the final
three-dimensional struc-
ture which proteins take
inside cells. There is no
common way to predict
the shape all protein struc-
tures. An unfolded protein
(a linear chain) has a large
number of degrees of
freedom, and applying a
mechanism to sort through
all possible shapes will
take time more than the
age of universe – even for
a single protein.
In FoldIt, the protein
structures to be solved
are provided as randomly
folded structures. Using
the tools provided in the
game, the players fold
the structures into the
most stable conformation
possible. Based on their
stability, the solutions are
scored, and the highest
scoring solutions are
analysed by scientists to
check their validity.
This strategy of
outsourcing part of a
challenging research
problem to the public is
called ‘citizen science’;
it encourages direct par-
ticipation of the public
with mainstream science,
and educates them about
the important topics in
science. The idea is not
new: before the arrival
of mainstream universi-
ty-driven science, it was
done by citizens motivat-
ed by reason and desire
to understand nature.
Both Charles Darwin and
Galileo count as citizen
scientists, and fields like
biology and astronomy
have progressed largely
by the contribution of
amateur scientists.
In the 21st
century, the
model of citizen science
has changed. Now a
well-defined problem with
loose constraints is passed
onto citizens to solve.
These usually belong
to the category where
large data collection and
sorting is required, and
computational methods
are not enough to
manage the scale of the
problem. In FoldIt, the
numerous folding states
of proteins are identified
using puzzle-solving
capabilities of individ-
uals which can bypass
computational efforts
desired by algorithms.
Other popular examples
include EteRNA, which
deals with the folding of
RNA structures, and is
very similar to FoldIt.
Another, ClickWorkers is
run by NASA to classify
images of Martian craters
(a task which done by
solitary graduate students
would require months
of effort), and Quantum
Moves which simulate the
movement of atoms in the
lattice. There is a larger
list of such citizen science
games online
FoldIt can be down-
loaded on your local
computer and runs all
three popular operating
systems: Windows,
MacOs, and Linux. The
game provides a few in-
troduction puzzles which
teaches players how to
play it, but beyond that
the player can choose
from science puzzles
that are running. These
puzzles do not last
forever, though they may
run for months until they
are considered ‘solved’.
Often, these puzzles are
either unsolved structures
of known proteins, or
prediction of structures
for synthetically designed
proteins. Players can
collaborate with each
other by chats, organizing
groups and sharing puzzle
solutions. Additionally,
novel strategies discov-
ered from players can be
applied to develop better
algorithms to automate
the process. This, in
turn, will help in making
the predicting structure
for artificially designed
proteins simple, such that
designed proteins can
be effectively made for
practical purposes.
Since its inception,
FoldIt has been a
powerful tool for advanc-
ing the number of proteins
with folded structure.
To its merit, it has some
considerable accomplish-
ments: in 2011, the FoldIt
community deciphered
the previously unknown
structure of Mason-Pfizer
monkey virus (M-PMV)
which is responsible
for HIV infections. The
protein structure was
solved in ten days of
the puzzle going live,
whereas it had previously
remained unsolved for
15 years when attempt-
ed using conventional
scientific approaches. In
January 2012, the FoldIt
community predicted the
structure of a syntheti-
cally designed protein,
which was later improved
by players themselves
to improve efficiency
18-fold. Last year, the
Mars Inc. and UC Davis
had released a series of
puzzles to decipher the
structure of aflatoxin,
a group of carcinogens
which are known to
contaminate food crops
around the world. The
final goal is to design
an enzyme which can
degrade these aflatoxins
based upon the structural
prediction of aflatoxins.
Perhaps, if you are too
busy to find time to save
the world alone, you can
give FoldIt a try

I
t may be a surprise
– for those who re-
member treading on
rogue LEGO pieces
in the dark – to hear the
company is going green
by producing plant-based
plastics! Known as LEGO
Botanical Elements, they
will start to enter playsets
later on this year, with the
first pieces to be replaced
including trees, bushes,
and leaves. The plastic
itself is sourced from
sugar cane – while it may
still have some ethical
and ecological issues, it
is far more responsible
compared to crude oil.
Thanks to the powers
of modern science, the
plant-based plastic pieces
are technically identical
to those produced using
conventional plastic
producing methods.
Let us take a few
moments to appreciate
what this change means.
Due to the time it takes
for plastics to break down,
they are often seen in the
environment long after
“Microplastics
can enter our
food chain
through
plankton and
fish”
being dumped by people.
Globally, very little
plastic is recycled due to
the material’s properties
– with its durability and
temperature resistance,
plastic is notoriously
hard to recycle, and it
so often breaks down in
the environment where
it is dropped. This is, of
course, unless it enters the
ocean via a river, or by
direct action of humans.
Here the plastics break
down under UV light and
transform into microplas-
tics. These microplastics
are then consumed by
plankton which in turn
are consumed by fish that
can be caught and eaten
by humans. This means
plastic and its toxins are
abletoenterourfoodchain
and therefore potentially
poison us. By working to
the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) to support
and build the demand
for sustainably-sourced
plastic. As part of this,
Lego joined the Bioplastic
Feedstock Alliance (BFA)
to aid in securing fully
sustainable sourcing of
raw material for the bio-
plastics industry. LEGO
is not the first company
to make such a move in
order to help appeal to
consumers who are trying
to reduce their impact on
the planet. When LEGO
first hit the market in 1949,
the dangers of plastic
entering ecosystems and
climate change would not
be discussed or pondered
for decades to come. Both
companies and consumers
are becoming more envi-
ronmentally conscious,
which is consequently
helping to drive such
a change in one of the
world’s largest toy brands.
Lego goes green (but red blocks still available) // CC
remove the amount of oil-
based plastics entering the
food chain, we can help to
prevent such occurrence.
To make this step
forward, the LEGO
Group partnered with
PHOENIX
From the Ashes
Phoenix, Imperial’s Art Magazine presents “From the
Ashes”, a six-week long exhibition which embodies the
cycle of art.
Join us at the opening night, Wednesday 21st
March, at
Imperial’s Blyth Gallery, to mark the start of this aesthetic
journey.
