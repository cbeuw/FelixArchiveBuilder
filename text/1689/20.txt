I
’m sure many people
either are thinking
about or have had
the idea before of a
backpacking trip around
South East Asia (SEA).
It’s a region filled with
its own unique culture,
traditional cuisine that
you can’t find anywhere
else in the world, and –
most importantly – its
beautifully untouched
yet accessible nature. As
a boy who grew up in
Malaysia, I had the luxury
of enjoying all of these as
well as experiencing them
on my first ever backpack-
ing trip.
Conveniently, the other
SEA countries are located
within three hours of flight
time from my homeland,
and I’d been particularly
motivated to visit Vietnam
and Cambodia since I was
very young (I mean after
watching the famous
Casey Neistat’s travel
videos on YouTube). This
article will be helpful for
first-time backpackers
and/or those who plan
to visit South East Asia.
It covers points like
travelling essentials,
special tips, and the local
culture of different South
East Asian countries
which include Vietnam,
Cambodia, and Malaysia!
Travelling essentials
The right mindset when
preparing for a backpack-
ing trip should always be:
“Pack only the essentials
for survival, and pack
light”. A backpack size of
30-40L is ideal to fit all of
your travelling essentials.
Personally, I went for
the cheap Highlanders
Starav 45L rucksack sold
by Argos. I needed that
much space because of the
camera gear I tend to carry
around, which took up
half the backpack. Hence,
you can imagine how little
space that was for the
‘essentials’. Medicines
and travel insurance are
vital, so do some research
to understand the risks in
the country you’re trav-
elling to. Painkillers and
medicines for common
sickness, like colds and
fevers, are a must. Other
than that, well-known
travel insurance is offered
by World Nomads which
covers up to 140 countries
and has a good policy that
fits most backpackers’
needs.
Also, as a backpacker,
try to plan ahead for a
wide range of activities
you’ll be doing, which
includes selection of
proper clothes and shoes.
For clothes, pack very
little of each type but bring
a wide range – sports,
city-touring, swimming,
and wedding, as you never
know. Besides that, a good
pair of walking boots or
trainers is always a back-
packer’s favourite. Also,
bring a camera if you’re
an avid photographer
like me, but phone-pho-
tography is good enough
for most. Lastly, don’t
forget to borrow a good
thick English book from
Imperial library, just to let
everyone else know that
you’re smart.
What’s it like in SEA
When compared to the
UK, SEA is very humid
and hot. On average, the
temperature there ranges
from 25 to 32o
C, with 80%
humidity. This makes
perspiration a problem
for those who have never
visited before. Shower-
ing 2-3 times a day is
normal practice, hence be
prepared to change your
clothes very often. While
I was backpacking, hand
washing my clothes was
my daily task. With a little
bit of soap, some water,
and a basin, you’re good
to go, and then you just
need to leave it outdoors.
Do not worry – there will
be plenty of sunshine!
Again, with the heat and
humidity, slippers are
very commonly worn for
outdoor walking so get
your hands on a pair if
you have a chance!
Food here is very differ-
ent from typical European
cuisine. You might not
like it initially. However,
definitely keep on trying
as I promise that you’ll
fall in love with it. In this
region, the best food is
found on the streets, since
very rarely is the tradition-
al cuisine done right in a
fancy restaurant. To find
the best meal spots, ask
the locals, look for signs
if the restaurant is full,
or look up food bloggers
online as they know best.
Best mindset
One crucial mistake
most people make is
over-romanticising a
backpacking journey.
By and large, we travel
to escape the norm and
to relax our minds and
bodies before heading
back to the ‘reality’;
yet, backpacking is even
more physically tiring
than our regular lifestyle.
In addition, backpackers
often have to make
compromises during the
journey as money supply
is low. People are willing
to go to different extents
when it comes to saving
money in general, but to
save money while you’re
travelling is yet another
story. So in most cases,
backpacking is quite
Felix’s Guide to backpacking in South East Asia
South East Asia is a popular destination between backpackers but long-term backpacking trips require a great
deal of knowledge and preparation. Luckily, travel writer YanKai Kee has shared some backpacking 101 and his
first-hand experience of touring the a rea.

“One crucial

tough.
The reason why I think
everyone should have
this mindset before going
on an epic backpacking
journey is so they can
prepare their minds for
the worst. To use a cliché:
you are going to enjoy
something even more if
you set your expectations
low. Moments of leaving
a city and realising you
left your phone behind,
having to force yourself
to wash clothes despite
the tiring day, or having
bad weather for consecu-
tive days can dilute your
backpacking experience.
But once you’ve accepted
there’s also the ‘dull and
boring’ part within the
trip and prepared your
mind for such hardships,
I guarantee you’ll have a
memorable trip.
However, having said
that,howcanInotmention
those beautiful moments
you’re most likely
going to enjoy during a
backpacking journey?
Backpacking is for the
beautiful panoramic scen-
eries that most people are
too tired to hike to; it is for
the story-telling sessions
you get when you meet
fellow backpackers; it is
for those nights where you
fall asleep listening to the
waves of the ocean, and so
on. It’s just like life, isn’t
it? Having a cocktail of
new experiences, adrena-
line rushes, fun and tiring
moments.
Finally, one of the
most important mindsets
you need to have is
acknowledging yourself
as an outsider. You’re
given a chance to explore
beautiful countries, hence
respect the locals and their
culture. For example, in
Malaysia, it’s prohibited
for a man to shake a
Malay woman’s hand.
Practical tips
Next up is something
practical that one must
take into account – hostels.
Choosing accommodation
is crucial since the hostel
is a ‘safe-house’when one
is travelling to a foreign
country. You need to be
able to trust the employees
that work there with pro-
tecting your belongings,
providing good travelling
tips, and keeping the
cleanliness of your bed.
Trust me, you don’t want
to wake up in the middle
of the night playing hide
and seek with bed bugs.
One popular site trusted
by many backpackers is
HostelWorld. I usually
prioritise reading reviews
about security, cleanli-
ness, and value for money,
while the rest are bonuses.
When staying at back-
packer hostels, you’ll
most often encounter
like-minded people that
travel from different
corners of the world, so
don’t be afraid to say “Hi”
and introduce yourself! To
me, sharing experiences
is like viewing the world
through the story-teller’s
eyes, and you grow a dif-
ferent perspective as you
go along the journey and
meet even more people.
It’s a rare and unique
learning experience, espe-
cially for people like me
who had lived in Malaysia
for most of my life.
Special tips
Disclaimer: the follow-
ing are activities which
I found to be fun, but
you might not find such
experiences to be equally
entertaining.
If you’re visiting
Vietnam and are of the ad-
venturous type, definitely
try to buy a motorbike for
either the Hanoi–Ho Chi
Minh or Ho Chi Minh–
Hanoi bike trip (then sell it
off at the destination city).
I didn’t have a chance to
try the long journeys but
took short trips between
cities and had a hell of a
lot of fun. Rated as one of
the most scenic highway
in Vietnam, Hai Van Pass
is where I rode during
my time in Danang. Then
again, riding a motorbike
in Vietnam requires good
to excellent driving skills
duetoitstrafficconditions,
that can only be described
as wild. It’s also worth
noting that such motor-
bike journeys are illegal
unless you have a driving
licence recognised by the
“Trust me, you
don’t want to
wake up in the
middle of the
night playing
hide and seek
with bed bugs”
Vietnamese government,
so do it at your own risk.
Other than that, if you are
an avid hiker, the south of
Vietnam would suit you
very much! Places such as
Sapa are straight out of a
children’s fairy tale if you
ask me – people live in a
valley with symmetrical
paddy fields running all
along both sides. If you
go during the right season,
the views will be excep-
tionally memorable.
In Cambodia, an
amazing backpacking
hostel, known as Monkey
Maya, is located at
Ream National Park,
Sinhanoukville. Only 30
minutes away by tuk-tuk
The scenic view along the valleys of Sapa, Vietnam // YanKai Kee
from the main city, the
place is a quiet nature
hostel, perfect if you want
to escape from the hustle
and bustle. I was there
for three nights and ab-
solutely loved the vibes.
The staff is a mix of locals
and Europeans that aren’t
shy to share their hostel’s
weird and funky culture.
Finally, for the country
I grew up in, Malaysia,
the two main destinations
I’ll introduce are Penang
and Tioman Island, both
of which are islands along
the east and west coasts
of Peninsular Malaysia
(West Malaysia). In
Penang, go for the local
food, but don’t just rely
on the internet as the
locals always know
better places. In Tioman
Island (personal favourite
here), there are several
villages which you can
stay in. I recommend
Genting village as it has
a good balance between
civilisation and nature: it
offers accessibility to the
internet and food, yet it’s
rural enough not to lose
the vibes of a small Malay
village by the beach. In
addition, other than being
a diving and snorkelling
heaven, Tioman is not
short of adventurous
hiking trails where a local
guide is needed.
