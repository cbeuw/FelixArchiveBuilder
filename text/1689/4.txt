"I was told I wouldn't be able to balance childcare with
a PhD" – women on the path to academia

Women face
derogatory comments
from staff, advice
not to do PhDs, and
hostile SOLE feedback
from students.

were more
likely to
hear peers make derog-
atory comments about
women, nearly one in
four women still report-
ed experiencing misog-
yny from staff. More
women also felt gender
impacted how they were
treated by their lecturers
than felt the same about
their peers.
As with comments
from their peers, the vast
majority of instances
seem to take the form
of off-the-cuff remarks:
women reported teaching
assistants saying they
should be the one to
shake up solutions since
it would “help me learn
how to cuddle my baby in
the future”, tutors telling
women in the group
they could “do the easy
equations”, and demon-
strators in computer labs
saying “trust girls to care
so much about colours”
when female undergrad-
uates were picking out
wires. Students reported
feeling uncomfortable
about these comments,
but being reluctant to call
them out lest they be seen
as “humourless”.
A number of women at
Imperial also reported not
having access to the same
teaching opportunities as
their male peers. “I’ve had
consultants preferentially
teach the males in the
hospital group, and some-
times ignored questions
from me and my female
colleagues,” wrote one
medical student, while
another said she was not
allowed into surgery by
her consultant since she
“would make a great GP”.
She was told to do work
on the ward instead, while
males in her group attend-
ed surgery.
Other women reported
assumptions about their
future life choices being
used to convince them
not to pursue careers in
research. Frequently,
respondents to the survey
told Felix about times
when they’d been told
not to go into academia
or other high-intensity
careers because they
would soon be having
children, and “would
not be able to balance
childcare with work”.
One medical student was
told “there was no point
in pursuing a high-flying
research career, because
I would soon get married,
fall pregnant, and leave
the profession”. This
comment came from “a
man hired to be a pastoral
guide for female and male
students, with power over
their careers in terms of
references.”
Another respondent re-
ported frequent incidents
of women being told to
go into “teaching and jobs
requiring empathy, like
nursing”, even when they
clearly expressed their
intention to pursue a PhD,
and had achieved top
grades throughout their
time at Imperial.
A 2014 report from the
government’s Science and
Technology Committee
identified that only 17%
of STEM professors were
women, and that – while
there was “no single
explanation for the lack
of gender diversity” – “it
is the result of perceptions
and biases combined with
the impracticalities of
combining a career with a
family”. The report found
that the early period of
academic STEM careers
was characterised by a
lack of job security, and –
since this period coincides
with a time when many
begin to think about start-
ing families – there was
a high attrition rate as a
result.
Professor Curry be-
lieves this attrition rate
can have a knock-on
effect for women at the
undergraduate level:
“Most of the time, the
person standing at the
front of the lecture theatre
is a man, so a young
woman coming in to do
a science or engineering
degree thinking ‘what are
my chances in this field?’,
the rational assessment is
that your chances are less
than those of a man.”
As these women pro-
gress through the ranks
of academia, as well as
facing barriers from their
superiors or those allo-
cating grant funding, they
will often face challenges
from below, as students
give them much more
hostile feedback.
“Student feedback is
incredibly biased against
women,” one postdoc
researcher reports. “Even
if two academics deliver
similar lectures and the
outcomes for the students
is the same, the feedback
about a woman will be
hostile and negative,
whereas about men it
will be pretty average.”
She points to a study into
student evaluations of
teaching (SET) – surveys
like Imperial’s SOLE,
upon which universities
often base promotion or
firing of lecturers – which
shows students regularly
rate women lower than
men. Such evaluations
have become increasingly
important in the higher ed-
ucation landscape as they
help form judgements in
the Teaching Excellence
Framework – a rating
system for universities
which revealed its first set
of results last year.
As well as the amount
of scrutiny received,
female academics will
often be described in
negative terms compared
to men. A couple of years
ago, Dr Ben Schmidt,
an assistant professor
of history in the USA,
scraped descriptive data
from 14 million reviews
on RateMyProfessor.com,
and compared what kind
of adjectives were used to
describe men and women.
Words like ‘funny’,
‘cool’, and ‘brilliant’ were
more likely to be used
to describe men, while
women were more likely
to be called ‘harsh’, ‘an-
noying’, and ‘aggressive’.
Language can get quite
vitriolic. One respondent
told Felix: “My peers will
frequently call female lec-
turers things like ‘bitch’
behind their back if work
is returned late, but their
male counterparts are
not subject to anywhere
near the same level of
abuse.” Another student
said: “One student was
rejected at an interview
by a woman, and started
loudly saying unrepeata-
ble things in the computer
room about her on the
basis of her gender.”
A first-year student
from the Faculty of Engi-
neering, spoke about her
experience: “After our
first term we had SOLE
feedback, and this divide
was evident. It was also
there in our course group
chats. If a man teaches
poorly, they don’t really
say too many negative
things, but if a woman
teaches something poorly,
they’ll just relentlessly
call her stuff like ‘bitch’.”
“My peers,” she said,
“are much less kind
towards female lecturers.”
“Female
academics
will often be
described
in hostile
terms when
compared to
men”
How can we improve inclusion across sports clubs?

Despite a welcoming
environment, a
number of students
don't feel sports teams
are treated equally.

I
n 2015, Women’s
Rugby were sched-
uled to play out
Varsity, having been
assigned the Headline
Match, However, after
coaches left earlier than
scheduled, the stands
emptied while the match
was in progress, and the
team was left stranded at
the stadium, despite pre-
vious assurances from
Sport Imperial that this
would not happen. The
women’s team had also
been promised dinner
and drinks following
the match, but arrived to
find the men’s team had
been fed, and were asked
to leave the facilities.
By the time the women
arrived, most of the food
was eaten, and the re-
mainder was cold. Some
team members also
reported receiving abuse
from a Sport Imperial
employee, while one
player told Felix that, as
they were ushered onto
the last coaches, “drunk
male rugby players…
were shouting how they
were waiting for ‘those
lesbians’.”
Following complaints
from the Women’s Rugby
Club, an investigation was
launched by the College,
which upheld the majority
of the claims, but found
“no evidence” for sexist
or misogynistic language
used by staff (members of
the club maintain sexist
language was used).
Professor Debra Hum-
phris, then-Vice Provost
(Education), said: “As an
institution that strives for
excellence, we must take
a leading role in moving
towards a more mutually
respectful community.”
Three years on, and
with another women’s
team headlining Varsity,
have things changed?
While fewer students
had experienced misog-
yny as part of their Club,
Society, or Project (CSP)
than within the academic
sphere, over a quarter of
the women surveyed said
they had faced sexism. Of
these, the vast majority
were those involved with
sports teams. In general,
students were less likely
to have experienced dis-
crimination from fellow
CSP members (21% of re-
spondents had), but were
much more likely to have
faced it from members
of other CSPs (36% of
respondents).
A number of respond-
ents reported clubs
participating in sexist
behaviour, particularly
objectification of women.
One student told Felix:
“I have been in multiple
sports clubs over the
years, and am a fan of
sports night. However,
one game has particularly
stuck in my mind. It was
played by a male club,
who would announce
the name of a woman on
their club’s other table,
and then count up to ten.
The male members of
the club would put their
hand down when they
thought they had reached
the appropriate rating for
that girl. This was all in
earshot of the girls they
were rating.”
Other women reported
sports teams “referring to
Union ‘pussy’ as ‘cold’”,
while another said “It
would be nice to see
women promoted more in
sport, and not put down or
harassed by men.”
The organisation of
sports teams at Imperial,
and in particular the
resources different clubs
receive, was also a source
of discontent for women
in sports. In total, about
30% of respondents
agreed with the statement
“Sport Imperial (the
College’s sporting body)
ensure all sports teams are
treated equally”, while the
same number disagreed,
and the majority were un-
decided. However, when
respondents not involved
with sports teams were
removed, the majority of
students felt Sport Im-
perial did not treat teams
equally, with only 12% of
women agreeing they did.
While some of this
discrepancy could be ex-
plained by the fact men’s
and women’s teams may
be in differently classed
divisions, a number of
students said they felt
women’s clubs were not
provided with as much
support. “Even though the
two teams [of my sport]
are in the same division,”
one student told Felix,
“most people seem to
believe the men’s team is
more important. They get
better training slots, and
much more funding for
coaching.”
Another club member
said: “Our club has had to
struggle to be taken seri-
ously and included in Im-
perial activities, whereas
our male counterpart is
one of the most respected
clubs. I believe it is only
through them helping us
that we have been taken
seriously.”
Emma*, a member of
a women’s sporting team,
told Felix: “I think Sport
Imperial has a completely
different set of goals and
values to what can be ex-
pected of a sports coordi-
nator. Their primary focus
is branding and ‘value
added’ to the College
reputation, as opposed
to engaging as many
people as possible. It is
not acknowledged that
women’s sports are more
likely to recruit beginners,
and therefore need more
support and coaching
to be able to safely play
these sports.”
She went on to say
the higher membership
numbers for men’s clubs
meant they got preferen-
tial allocation for training
space; some women’s
sports teams train until
11pm on weekday nights,
meaning members
didn’t get home until
past midnight. She also
highlighted that increased
centralisation of sport ser-
vices, combined with the
fact many women sports
players are spread across
campuses, has meant
female students are more
likely to be involved with
sport at a local level.
Emma also raised
concerns about current
promotion of women in
sport, saying Imperial
Girls Can week was “a
particularly sore spot
for everyone I know”:
“Patronising ‘calorie
burning’ spin classes,
turning up and giving out
pink t-shirts at our regular
BUCS fixtures… when
really members of our
committee are buying kit
and equipment out of their
own pocket, organising
the referees, and coaching
the team themselves with
no payment or training – it
tasted particularly bitter.”
In a statement for Felix
a College spokesperson
said: "Sport Imperial is
committed to encouraging
participation from all
students. We know that
women can face barriers
in participating in sport,
that’s why we work to
challenge perceptions,
celebrate women’s sport,
and create an environment
where everyone feels
comfortable."
"It is not the case that
Sport Imperial gives pref-
erential funding to male
teams. Sport Imperial
funding is allocated to
clubs according to where
their highest ranked team
sits within BUCS – this
could be a men’s or
women’s team. The club
itself then makes the
decision as to how this
funding is distributed,
and to which teams.
For sports that are not
included in BUCS, clubs
can apply for funding
which is allocated based
on the developmental and
competition requirements.
Sport Imperial applies an
objective process with
equal opportunities for
both men’s and women’s
clubs and teams."
