Can we break the glass chair, and bring more women
Currently only 11% of films are made by women. We need to try and break this trend, but could 2018 be the
breakout year for women in cinema?

“So rarely do
we see films
led by women,
and even
rarer made by
women”
H
ollywood is
narcissistic.
A community
that reflects the
vanity and self-obsession
of its constituents, when
Tinseltown reflects back
on 2017 they will not
remember it for the Fall
of Mosul, the Rohingya
Crisis, or the ousting of
Robert Mugabe, but for
the wave of allegations
of sexual misconduct that
saw a number of La-La
Land’s power players –
from Kevin Spacey to
Dustin Hoffman – ban-
ished to the shadows. The
watershed moment came
in October, with almost
100 different women
accusing producer Harvey
Weinstein of varying
degrees of sexual assault;
since then the number
of accused men in the
entertainment industry
stands at around 200. It
is disturbing to think that
up until this recent tipping
point these men were able
to get away with such vile
actions, highlighting just
what a colossal change in
victims, to the extent that
some even sympathised
with the former and
suggested that the latter
might just be disingen-
uous. While it is impor-
tant that we allow due
process and understand
the difference between
allegations and confirmed
guilt, the National Sexual
Violence Resource Centre
estimates that just 2% of
sexual assault accusations
are false. If someone is
accused of sexual mis-
conduct, there is statisti-
cally a pretty good chance
they did it. USA Today
observed fairly early on
that 2017 was the year in
which sexual harassment
became a fireable offence
– a long overdue devel-
opment. It is easy to see
why the likes of Michael
Haneke and Catherine
Deneuve have expressed
concerns about the
momentum of the Wein-
stein Effect, and the story
that broke about Aziz
Ansari did give weight
to their argument that the
#MeToo and Time’s Up
movements have the po-
tential to turn into a witch
hunt. What is clear is that
they are the beginnings
of a belated conversation
whereby society can
hopefully start to reshape
and redefine what is and is
not appropriate behaviour,
and move to a new equi-
librium that makes for
safe and happy lives for
everyone.
The ramifications of
the Weinstein Effect have
been wide-spreading. It
is worth noting that he is
not just a man guilty of
forcing women to engage
in sexual acts with him in
exchange for lubricating
the progression of their
careers. Weinstein, both
with his first venture into
the film industry with
Miramax, and later with
The Weinstein Company,
is also a bully. While he
made a huge contribution
to American independ-
ent cinema, launching
the careers of the likes
of Steven Soderbergh,
Quentin Tarantino, and
David O. Russell, as well
as providing an audience
for international fare from
such names as Krzysztof
Kieślowski, Pedro
Almodóvar, and Abbas
Kiarostami, Weinstein is
renowned for his beyond
aggressive campaigns
during awards season,
managing to as recently as
last year drive the average
Lion to six Academy
Award nominations by
throwing around his
significant weight. It was
a much welcomed change
to have a much cleaner
and more respectful Oscar
race this year. Far more
significantly, however, the
behaviour of Weinstein
and others has led to
a lobbying for greater,
deserved female empow-
erment.
In addition to a
conversation about the
undercurrents of sexual
practice, there has been
much discussion about
the marginalisation of
women in film. So rarely
do we see films led by
women, and even rarer
is the film created from a
female perspective. While
the likes of Lady Bird,
Three Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri, The
Shape of Water, Phantom
Thread, and The Post all
featured strong female
characters in leading
roles, in 2017 only 11%
of films were made by
women, a figure that has
not increased since 2000.
As well as delivering
more positive portrayals
of women on screen, we
need to get more women
working behind the
camera. There was much
celebration when Greta
Gerwig became only the
fifth women to be nom-
inated for Best Director
and Rachel Morrison
became the first woman
nominated for Best Cin-
ematography. Yet if we
do not make changes at a
grassroots level, and have
more studios, production
companies, and independ-
ent financiers invest in
women, it will be difficult
to see women like Gerwig
regularly nominated.
Speaking from a purely
statistical perspective,
when there are only five
slots available for Best
Director, and only one
in ten contending films
is made by a woman (a
figure even lower if one
accounts for the type of
mini-major studio films
that tend to garner awards
attention), it would be
unlikely to have a woman
nominated in the category
every year.
It must be said that
2017 was a very good
year for female directors,
if not in quantity then in
quality and prominence.
Gerwig’s Lady Bird led
that narrative, earning
five Oscar nominations
as one of the year’s best
reviewed films. Patty
Jenkins was the other big
story, delivering a colossal
box office success with
Wonder Woman, and
being rewarded with a
sequel that comes with
a $10 million pay day.
Looking beyond those two
headline-makers, there
was significant acclaim
for Lynne Ramsay (You
Were Never Really Here),
Jane Campion (Top of the
Lake: China Girl), Chloe
Zhao (The Rider), Claire
Denis (Let the Sunshine
In), Agnes Varda (Faces
Places), Naomi Kawase
(Radiance), and Sofia
Coppola (The Beguiled)
at Cannes, while the
summer saw Kathryn
Bigelow, thus far the
only woman to win the
Academy Award for Best
Director, return with
another gritty and truthful
drama with Detroit.
Going back earlier in the
year, there was acclaim
at Sundance for Dee
Rees (Mudbound), Eliza
Hittman (Beach Rats),
Maggie Betts (Novitiate),
Zoe Lister-Jones (Band

Even more worrying
has been the focus on the
perpetrators and not the
directors into the film industry?

Aid), Gillian Robbespierre
(Landline), Kitty Green
(Casting JonBenet),
Maya Forbes (The Polka
King), Cate Shortland
(Berlin Syndrome), and
Helene Hegemann (Axotl
Overkill) in a line-up
that was close to 50%
female, indicating a wave
of change at independent
level. Ilyikó Enyedi’s On
Body and Soul won the
top prize in Berlin, and
went on to earn a Best
Foreign Language Film
nomination, a race in
which Angelina Jolie was
unexpectedly snubbed
for First They Killed
My Father. At the same
festival, Sally Potter (The
Party) and Agnieska
Holland (Spoor) had work
well received. Even if Ana
Lily Amirpour’s The Bad
Batch was a critical and
box office bomb, it was
refreshing to see a young
woman able to take risks
and create a work of such
singular vision.
There are still questions
marks amidst this wave of
positive change, however.
It is unfathomable that
Patty Jenkins, having
directed Charlize Theron
to the Oscar in one of the
greatest performances of
the century in Monster,
had to wait 14 years
to follow up her debut
feature. Ramsay returned
after six years, during
which time she had a tu-
multuous affair in charge
of Jane Got a Gun which
saw her quit in the first
morning of production.
That earned her a reputa-
tion as being difficult to
work with, a tag she has
referred to as “bullshit”.
As Mark Kermode rightly
observed, were Ramsay a
man she would be more
likely to be labelled a
perfectionist and a genius.
It will be interesting
now to see whether last
year’s success for female
directors, most notably
Gerwig and Jenkins, will
translate into a consistent
march towards equality
behind the camera. It will
evidently take a number
of years to properly assess
the impact of the recent
shake up in Hollywood on
cinema, as of course we
will not see any projects
that are now benefiting
for another couple of
years, but the early indi-
cations in terms of festival
line-ups and distribution
for women this coming
year are good. Sundance
again seems to be leading
the way: Desiree Akha-
van’s The Miseducation
of Cameron Post took
the top prize, beating out
work from Jennifer Fox
(The Tale), Reed Morano
(I Think We’re Alone
Now), and Christina
Choe (Nancy) in the U.S.
into long periods of inac-
tivity by studios reluctant
to back them in spite of
their critical and commer-
cial success.
There is also much
to look forward to later
in the year. Earlier this
week Julia Hart’s latest
Fast Color was warmly
received at South by
Southwest. Early reac-
tions to Ava DuVernay’s A
Wrinkle in Time have been
mixed, but that should
not take away from the
fact that she is only the
fourth female director to
have been given a budget
of above $100 million.
Josie Rourke, best known
for adapting Shakespeare
with a feminist spin on
stage, will make her cine-
matic debut in November,
pitting Saoirse Ronan
against Margot Robbie
in potential awards con-
tender Mary, Queen of
Scots. Alice Winocour,
known for her underrated
thriller Disorder, deals
with astronauts in her next
feature Proxima, starring
Eva Green. Another ac-
claimed French director
heading to space is Claire
Denis, making her Eng-
lish-language debut High
Life with Robert Pattinson
in the lead. Pattinson also
stars in the first part of
Joanna Hogg’s Martin
Scorsese-produced dou-
ble-header The Souvenir.
Like Pattinson, Nicole
Kidman is one of the best
actors in the business
when it comes to choosing
projects from interesting
filmmakers across the
globe. Karyn Kusama’s
The Invitation was one
of the best horror films
of recent years. They
team up for crime thriller
Destroyer this year. Elle
Fanning has become the
face of teenage angst
in cinema over the past
couple of years, and she
will continue in this vein
in Mélanie Laurent’s
adaptation of Galveston,
a novel by True Detective
showrunner Nic Pizzolat-
to. Laurent is best known
to English-speaking
audiences for her role
as Shosanna Dreyfus in
Inglourious Basterds, but
she has already shown
serious chops as a screen-
writer and filmmaker for
one so young.
The success of Lady
Bird was hailed to the
heavens, and called by
some the first female-cen-
tred coming-of-age film
from a female director.
Anyone that suggests that
has a short memory and
has forgotten Marielle
Heller’s excellent The
Diary of a Teenage Girl.
Jennifer Kent’s debut
The Babadook has been
attributed to many a night-
mare. She heads to 1920s
Tasmania for The Nightin-
gale, which she claimed is
not a horror, though that
is exactly what somebody
who was actually making
a horror would say. On
the television front it will
be interesting to see how
Andrea Arnold furthers
Jean-Marc Vallée’s work
in Big Little Lies.
This year’s Berlin Film
Festival featured a panel
named 50:50 by 2020.
Rather than giving in to
the pressure to lay out
a black carpet in lieu of
the traditional red one,
festival director Dieter
Kosslick demanded that
we have frank and intelli-
gent conversations about
the deep-seated issues
surrounding the treatment
of women in film, instead
of the meaningless
displays designed more
to protect the images of
Hollywood’s elite than
drive real, important
change. For us to jump
from 10:90 to 50:50 in
three years is perhaps too
ambitious a target. That
said, it appears as though
we are in the midst of
a significant paradigm
shift, and hopefully soon
the stories of Harvey
Weinstein’s seedy hotel
room massages, of Mark
Wahlberg being paid
millions as Michelle
Williams is paid $800
for reshoots, and of Patty
Jenkins having to wait
14 years to make her
sophomore effort will
be a distant, unsettling
memory – a stom-
ach-churning reminder of
our ugly failures and the
shameful way we have
deprived of ourselves of
great art in the name of
narrow-minded bigotry.

Elsewhere, Elizabeth
Chomko (What They
Had), Claire McCarthy
(Ophelia), Cathy Yan
(Dead Pigs) and Isabella
Eklöf (Holiday) had
films play, while there
were welcome returns
for Debra Granik (Leave

Jenkins (Private Life).
Granik has not made a
narrative feature in eight
years since she launched
Jennifer Lawrence’s
career on the way to four
Oscar nominations for
Winter’s Bone, while
Jenkins (no relation to
Patty) has not released
any work in eleven years
since The Savages got two
Oscar nods back in 2007.
The examples of Granik
and Jenkins demonstrate a
worrying trend of female
filmmakers being forced
