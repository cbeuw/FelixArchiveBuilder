seeming to
be on the
verge of spring, it seems
hard to believe that just
a couple of weeks ago
London had experienced
some of the most severe
snow days in years. Air
temperatures dropped to a
27-year low, and – much
to everyone’s bother –
signal failures and track
problems disrupted the
tube services citywide.
If you ventured out that
week wondering if you
had walked through a
portal to Siberia, you
actually were not too far
from the truth!
It was a vortex of cold
Siberian air – nicknamed
the ‘Beast from the
East’ – which caused
temperatures in the UK
to plummet so drastically.
The stream of northern
polar air, which originally
lingered at a very chilly
-50C, had unexpectedly
changed its wintry path
to the east, swooping over
the UK instead!
This was due to what
meteorologists refer to as
a Sudden Stratospheric
Warming, an unprecedent-
ed increase in the temper-
ature of the Earth’s atmos-
phere between 10-50km
above the surface. In this
atmospheric region, jet
streams of air currents
travel round the world
from west to east with
a special polar night jet
forming in winter months
that is seen to encircle
the area surrounding the
Earth’s poles. Occasion-
ally, changes in weather
patterns or increases in
pressure within the at-
mosphere of the Northern
Hemisphere may disturb
the westerly winds and
disrupt the smooth flow
of the polar night jets. The
distortion of these polar
jets could be powerful
enough to reduce, and
even reverse, the direction
of the westerly winds.
Additionally, the high-lat-
itude stratospheric air
starts to compress over
the polar ice caps; during
compression it can warm
by up to 50C in just a few
days. This results in newly
redirected easterly winds
which sink lower in the
atmosphere, disrupting
the polar vortex, causing
the cold jet streams to
flow further south than
usual.
“It was a
vortex of cold
Siberian air
–the‘Beast
from the East’
–which caused
temperatures
to plummet”
“We have to
realise the
weather we
experience
now is just
a physical
ramification of
many complex
systems
around the
globe”
In February, this very
phenomenon resulted in
the biting-cold Siberian
air streams swerving
around the UK, bringing
the unusual cold spell to
London. The weakened
westerly jet streams were
not powerful enough to
bring warm air from the
Atlantic over to the UK.
This resulted in a blanket
of crisp white (and later
grey and slushy) snow for
a week!
Looking back to a
couple of months ago,
there was a similar oc-
currence, as a significant
amount of snow over the
city descended, the likes
of which were unseen
since 2012! But the big
question is whether it is
climate change that is
causing these unprece-
dented weather patterns.
Largely, climate change
affects different regions
in different ways, and this
is a highly debatable topic
amongst experts in the
field. Scientists generally
do concur, however, that
human activity releasing
greenhouse gases has
definitely contributed to
the global climate shifts.
The direct results are
complicated, but the espe-
cially low winter temper-
atures this year provide
support for the argument
of climate change.
In fact, many scientists
think this is the precursor
to more extreme and
unpredictable weather
for future years to come.
What is worrying many
climatologists is that
there has recently been
an extraordinarily intense
heatwave in the Arctic,
despite it experiencing
no direct sunlight since
October. Temperatures
in the Arctic have been
recorded as warmer than
those in London, New
York, and Paris at any
one time! Furthermore, in
January, the US National
Snow and Ice Data
Center (NSIDC) released
news that the Arctic sea
ice cover had shrunk
to a “new record low”
of 5.04 million square
miles. This rate of sea ice
depletion is currently the
highest in at least 1,500
years, according to the
US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administra-
tion, which was published
last December. Global
climate systems are highly
dependent and sensitive
on each other, and such
drastic changes in one
part of the world will
have huge implications on
other regions.
that the weather patterns

the physical ramifications
of many complex systems
operating at various lo-
cations around the globe,
and are functions of many,
many different factors.
But at least for us here
in London, winter is now
(hopefully) over! As we
are all gearing up for the
coming of spring, we
do not have to suffocate
under a mountain of
fleeces, scarves, gloves,
and hats anymore…right?
Definitely! Despite yellow
warnings for snow and ice
still being issued across
the UK amidst concerns
of Storm Emma, these
are mostly concentrated
in northern England and
Scotland. Thus, London
seems to be off the hook in
terms of slushy pavements
and runny noses – at least
for now.

While we cannot be
sure whether this is simply
a shocking anomaly, or
the start of a new weather
trend, we have to realise
I can show you the world: How gene therapy brightens
the future for eye diseases
Developments in gene therapy could offer hope for a cure to inherited retinal diseases in the near future.

ou may have
your mother’s
eyes, or your
father’s nose,
as genetics plays a signif-
icant role in determining
physical traits such as
height and eye colour. But
genes can also determine
other things: diseases!
Cystic fibrosis is an exam-
ple of a disease that has
a genetic basis, meaning
that the conditions can be
passed on to subsequent
generations.
Genes are the infor-
mation that our bodies
hold, so our cells know
how to react in certain
environments. Imagine a
construction worker: she
obtains her information
from the blueprint (i.e.
genes), and from these in-
structions is able to build
an object. Simple, right?
Unfortunately not!
Errors do occur, and the
blueprint can contain
mistakes. In the case of
inherited retinal diseases,
a group of conditions that
affect the eyes, this can
result in symptoms such
as blurred eyesight, and
eventually loss of central
vision.
Research has indicated
that the cause of at least
five types of inherited
retinal diseases stem from
an erroneous gene known
as BEST1: it contains
information that builds
channels to allow sub-
stances such as calcium
ions to be transported
in and out of the cells.
Subsequently, this allows
these cells to interact with
the surrounding nerve
cells. A faulty form of the
BEST1 gene causes these
cells in the eyes, namely
the retinal pigment ep-
ithelium (RPE), to lose
function, resulting in
detachment of the RPE.
Previously proven in
mouse and canine models,
the integrity of RPE is
vital to the general health
of the eye, as it maintains
the correct environment
for other nearby cells.
Any detachment of the
RPE, large or small,
can impact the health
of photoreceptors – the
cells that are essential for
detecting light. Thus the
disease eventually leads
to the loss of sight, and is
currently untreatable.
“To correct
the error,
scientists have
been trying to
utilise viruses
as carriers”
To correct this error in
the genes, scientists have
tried to utilise viruses as
carriers to transport the
healthy copy of the gene
into the targeted cell.
While some may fear the
use of viruses – as they are
notorious for being infec-
tious and deadly – broadly
speaking, virus carriers
often have their virulence
removed, meaning they
would not be able to cause
any harm once modified.
This idea of transferring
the healthy copy of the
gene into a person is
called gene therapy.
Recently, a group
from the University of
Pennsylvania, led by
Karina E. Guziewicz, has
developed a treatment of
this type, targeting these
genetic forms of macular
degeneration in a canine
model. In the model, the
scientists have identified
the molecular mecha-
nisms at which the disease
is causing issues and
verified the identity of the
gene that needs to trans-
ported back to the patient
to reverse the mistake.
The researchers used
adenoviruses (AAV2) to
augment the BEST1 gene
in one eye, leaving the
other eye untreated for
comparison. The virus
that contained the healthy
gene was injected into the
sub-retinal region of the
eye with micro or mac-
ro-detachments.
Results indicated that
the host’s immune system
did not react to the virus,
suggesting the safety of
such a treatment, since
adverse immune respons-
es can lead to failure of
the therapy or result in
harmful effects on the
host. In addition, research-
ers found the delivery of
the healthy BEST1 gene
is well located, suggesting
the viruses are specific to
the intended target. Using
non-invasive scanning
techniques, the research-
ers also noticed the lesions
in the treated eyes were
resolved, showing the
restoration of the retinal
structure. As mentioned,
the structure of the eye is
essential for maintaining
normal vision, therefore
this clearly is a step
forward in curing inherit-
ed retinal diseases!
While dog models
closely resemble humans,
future research in this
field should use human
models with RPE cells to
further prove the safety
and efficacy of this gene
therapy. Furthermore,
the group discovered
that light stimulation can
worsen the detachment of
the RPE. Since this was
not observed in human
patients previously, more
work is needed to establish
whether this phenomenon
occurs in humans too.
