David Byrne is far too happy for my liking
A
s frontman
and founder
of New York
art-rock band
Talking Heads, David
Byrne is no stranger to
experimentation. Since
their final album, Naked,
in 1988, he’s released a
string of semi-successful
solo albums and collab-
orative projects with the
likes of Brian Eno and St.
Vincent. Something of a
renaissance man, Byrne
has dabbled in art, film
and theatre; earning him-
self a Grammy, an Oscar,
and a Golden Globe in the
process. His book, How
Music Works, serves as a
bible for aspiring artists
and music theorists. New
LP, American Utopia, is
his first nominally solo
release since 2004.
eclecticism comes at the
expense of consistency,
with very little in the way
of musical coherence
across the ten tracks.
Lyrically, the themes
are clearer. You’d be
forgiven for assuming
that American Utopia
must be ironically titled,
but Byrne assures us this
isn’t so. Part of his mul-
timedia project Reasons
to be Cheerful, the
record’s message is one of
optimism and positivity.
It’s an interesting sidestep
from a man who built a
career out of channelling
modern life’s anxieties.
Instead of expressing his
disillusion at society’s
commodities (think
‘Once in a Lifetime’), he
celebrates the art of the
ordinary and champions
the mundane in campfire
style sing-alongs. ‘Every
Day is a Miracle’, with
all its farmyard imagery
(“Now the chicken
imagines a heaven / Full
of roosters and plenty of
corn / And God is a very
old rooster / And eggs
are like Jesus, his son”),
comes across as more of a
Sunday school ditty than a
piece of avant-rock.
such as ‘Bullet’ (an ode
to a gunshot wound) and
‘Dog’s Mind’ (“We are
dogs in our own paradise
/ In a theme park of our
own / Doggy dancers
doing doody / Doggy
dreaming all day long”)
just come across as plain
weird. Byrne has also
come under fire for the
lack of diversity in his
production team – 25 men
- zero women - for which
he publicly apologised,
calling his decisions
“negligent”.
All this is not to say
that Byrne isn’t still at
the pinnacle of his art,
it’d be unfair to say he’s
lost touch. But, though it
pains me, it’s clear that
he’s really missed the
mark on this one.
It takes a village to raise a song
F
ittingly, my
debut review is
Superorganism’s
self-titled debut
album, released at the
beginning of March.
Superorganism is a band
formed by bonding
over memes and Skype
rehearsals. Seven of their
eight members currently
reside in East London
with eighth member, Soul,
living in Sydney. In group
photos they use a large
cut-out of Soul’s face. The
band’s mix of nationalities
and backgrounds shines
through in these 10 songs
championed by Domino
Records. The album
provides 33 minutes of
gloriously eclectic motifs,
unusual soundbites and
meticulous lyrics. (“Oh,
have you ever woke up
from a daydream / And
realised that the world’s
gone crazy? / You people
are all the same / Going
blah blah blah, going bang
bang bang”).
My main issue with this
album is its bitty nature,
the overwhelming use
of fragmented samples
in places can make for
frustrating listening. I
can’t help but think that
if ‘Nai’s March’ was to
come on during your
Spotify shuffle it would
be skipped, not enjoyed.
That being said, the
album flows well from
start to finish with the
most notable tracks being
‘Night Time’ and the
singles ‘Everybody Wants
to Be Famous’ and ‘Some-
thing For Your M.I.N.D’,
where the immersive
sounds pull through.
Whilst the dreamy
tones and quirkiness go
part way to making up for
the lack of depth, it is far
from revolutionary and I
personally believe it could
have been curated slightly
more carefully to give it
that edge and storyline.
I can imagine what a
magnificently energetic
live gig this would be, an
8-piece trying to groove
their way onto the indie/
psychedelic pop scene.
You can find them in
London, following their
17-date North American
Tour, on 25th
May. A

“Byrne deftly

an array of
genres and
styles. From
piano-backed
balladry
to rippling
electronica”
Always difficult to
pin down, Byrne deftly
navigates an array of
genres and styles, from
piano-backed balladry
to rippling electronica
(supplied by Eno), each
crevice filled with influ-
ences from across the
globe. However, one can’t
help but feel that this
“It’s an

sidestep

Now don’t get me
wrong, I appreciate what
he’s trying to say, I really
do. But there’s something
about the vibrancy of
this album that feels, not
insincere but, simple.
Maybe that’s just me.
After all, being cynical is
easy while genuine cheer
is difficult to summon.
But Byrne sounds tired
and blunted. Attempts to
veer off the beaten track
