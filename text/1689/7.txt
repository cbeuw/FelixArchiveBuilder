I
t is unnervingly
common: you pick
up your phone, open
your news app, and
scroll through the stories.
As usual, there is one
bemoaning what (insert
name of stupid politician
here) has to say. There is
one, invariably, discussing
Bitcoin. And there is one
reporting on a shooting in
a US school or university.
Whilst the statistics have
been inflated by some, it
doesn’t take much thought
to appreciate that our
American cousins have a
seriousproblemwithguns.
The debate, like many in
the modern Colosseum of
social media, is heated,
with vehement adherents
to ideologies on both
sides. Of course, this issue
is hardly new, having
plagued Presidents from
Obama back to Reagan.
The prime diffi-
culty in putting an end to
these atrocities lies in the
Second Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution. This
declares, in defence of the
individual against poten-
tial tyranny of the state,
the right to keep and bear
arms. Now, this doesn’t
mean that the government
cannot do anything about
it: State and Federal
authorities have the legal
power to regulate the
possession and use of
firearms, within certain
bounds. However, politi-
cians and Americans have
simply refused to compro-
mise on the issue. Unlike
other contentious political
debates, the charged and
highly partisan political
environment in the US
has decided that, for leg-
islation concerning guns,
there is no compromise
to be had. The powerful
National Rifle Association
(NRA), which boasts over
five million members
and control of basically
the entire Republican
party, has repeatedly and
vocally lobbied against
gun control in any
measure that has so far
been proposed. And that
is why President Trump is
a beacon of hope. I really
never thought I would
be saying that; let me
explain.
Don’t get me
wrong; Trump is not my
idea of a model of human
behaviour, and I certainly
don’t endorse a good
number of his statements
and policies. However,
although his erratic state-
ments, off-script speeches
and late night tweeting are
certainly highly political-
ly unconventional, and
arguably un-Presidential,
it is this quality – of a lack
of any desire to be liked or
respected on Capitol Hill
– that provides a potential
avenue of progress for
gun control in America.
The simple fact is that,
whilst Democrats hate
Trump, so do Republi-
cans. They made every
effort to get rid of him as
their candidate, and many
Republican lawmakers
still hold him in contempt.
But he doesn’t care. He
has only ever cared about
one thing: Donald Trump.
Now, that’s hardly an
admirable characteristic,
but what it does mean
is that he pretty much
only does what he thinks
he should do, and not
what people tell him he
should do. So, when he
encounters problems,
he is perfectly happy to
change his mind. He has
absolutely no concerns
about his political status,
because he doesn’t do
conventional politics. He
speaks to his supporters
directly, and engages with
whomever he needs to in
order to get what he wants
to get done, done. He
worked with Democrats
on a Spending Bill, and
has been negotiating with
them, much more closely
than some Republicans
would like, to make polit-
ical concessions in return
for increased border
security measures. In
short – Trump does what
he wants, not what he
thinks will poll well, or
what his party, or their
lobbyists, want him to.
And in this, he offers
an opportunity for real
change. The NRA has
pushed all the Republican
Senators and Congress-
man that it financially
supports – a large number
– to give no quarter on
gun control legislation.
But, for all the ears the
NRA has in Washington,
it now lacks that of a key
official: the President. In
a video recording of part
of a bi-partisan meeting
held by Trump to discuss
gun control, which the
Guardian recently pub-
lished online (I would
encourage you to watch
it), the President very
openly called out Law-
makers for being “afraid
of the NRA”, before pro-
claiming “they have less
power over me…. What
do I need?”. Now, don’t
think that he isn’t also in
bed with the NRA: they
donated $30 million to
his Presidential campaign,
and he has proclaimed
himself their friend re-
peatedly. But. Whilst he
may support their broad
aims in supporting the
Second Amendment, he
does not rely on their
support in the same way
that prior Presidents have
done, and that current Re-
publican officials do. He
likes them, but he doesn’t
need them. Trump has a
tendency of being very
happy to compromise on
what hard-line Republi-
cans view as politically
sacrosanct, in order to get
done whatever he happens
to want at the time. Gun
control is the ultimate
Republican red line, but
President Trump doesn’t
care. As a result, there are
two clear paths to the pos-
sibility that Trump may
finally secure gun control
in America.
For the first part,
gun control offers him
probably the largest bar-
tering chip for Democratic
support that he could ask
for; the possibility that
he could get Democratic
support to build his wall,
in return for lasting and
effective gun control,
is very real. Secondly,
Trump is sympathetic
to gun control, and, as
pointed out, he pretty
much does what he likes,
and leaves party lines to
be blurred by his words
and actions. Therefore,
even without an exchange
with the Democrats, gun
control under Trump
could well happen, if he
is convicted enough in
his belief that it should be
legislated. In the afore-
mentioned meeting, he
supported the re-introduc-
tion of a bill to the Senate
that imposes “universal
background checks for
commercial gun purchas-
es, including at gun shows
and over the internet”. He
argued strongly against a
Republican, saying that,
where there is concern
over the mental health
of an individual who
possesses guns, the guns
should be confiscated
immediately, and due
process – i.e. adjudication
in courts – could happen
later. His approach is by
no means liberal, but it is,
if nothing else, pragmatic.
He supports banning
assault weapons, raising
the minimum purchase
age, and enforcing stricter
mental health screening,
all sensible approaches,
and all vast steps forward
in the immovable tussle of
American politics.
For all that his confused
tweeting and conflicting
statements give off an
air of incompetence, and
disorganisation, they
fundamentally betray
a glaring self-interest.
Trump wants to do what
he said he would get done,
and anything that pops
up along the way that he
fancies. He is not a com-
mitted ideologue, nor does
he care for the support of
those who are. Whilst this
may, for the most part, be
to his detriment, he might
just end up wielding this
tendency to the benefit
of the people of America.
Here’s hoping that gun
control is his legacy.
