Life, Death, and Theatre with the Ekdahls
M
isha Handley
steps onto
the stage as
Alexander
Ekdahl and exclaims:
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to the longest
play in the history of
the world! ...Will it be
boring?” Laughter from
the audience marks a
departure from Bergman’s
original cinematic ver-
sion. Beresford’s play
has a feel-good vibe that
sometimes feels like
superficiality.
The play is indeed more
than three hours long,
with enough scope for two
intervals – but this is nec-
essary to cater to the rich
and complex material, and
the moments rarely drag.
We are stimulated by the
energetic atmosphere,
which is enhanced by
the special effects that
accompany the dramatic
action. They sometimes
have a showy quality
but occasionally, when
combined with seamless
acting, are very successful
in creating an emotional
ambience that holds the
spectator in thrall of the
actor’s performance.
Despite the title, it is
above all Alexander’s
perspective, that of an
imaginative and sensitive
child, which we experi-
ence throughout Stephen
Beresford’s stage adapta-
tion of Ingmar Bergman’s
semi-autobiographical
film. The stage version is
moderately successful at
retaining the integrity of
the original in its explo-
ration of broad existential
themes, which may not
be condensed down to an
hour or so’s entertainment
without cutting through
the vital nerves and life-
blood of this intricate
web of human turmoil.
The enjoyment is mostly
derived from the drama
being well-played by a
skillful cast.
The play begins on
Christmas Day – ideal
for some reminiscing, in
which Dame Penelope
Wilton indulges and
is comically pathetic
without pathos. She is the
matriarch of the theatrical
Ekdahl family, charming
and ridiculous with her
imperiousairsandaffected
manners, a hangover from
her years on the stage.
Dame Wilton manages to
be nuanced with a touch
of grey-haired dignity
and much wistfulness for
her bygone years. Though
time hasn’t faded her
romance with a family
friend, and something in
her manner convinces us
she was beautiful in youth.
Her son is Alexander’s
father: in the play, a
childish, cocky embar-
rassment of a husband; in
the film weary and passive
with more than the usual
amount of melancholy for
his age. Before the drama
yet unfolds, he delivers
a speech that ought to
sound pensive in shallow
and unconvincing tones.
It serves as a prologue to
the play and meditates
upon the purpose of
theatre itself, in a strange
intercrossing of worlds
between the stage and real
life; the purpose of the
theatre, he concludes, is to
provide a few moments’
refuge from the harshness
of life, whilst mirroring it
at the same time.
Fanny and Alexander
succeeds quite well: fan-
tasticalelementsofghosts,
telepathy and magic are
effective at transporting
us to a parallel world, and
to some extent at obliv-
iating the mundane. But
these remain primarily
tools that symbolize and
abstract the character’s
sufferings and allow us to
enter their imaginations,
seeing the world as they
experience it.
Beresford’s production
seems to include a marked
divide between the realms
of the living and the dead
which is less present
in the film. Dinnertime
scenes include the lavish
menu being read out by
two servants, whilst the
Ekdahl family mime
the merry enjoyment of
simple pleasures. These
sometimes occur right
next to more emotionally
tense scenes, such as one
in which Alexander is
wrestling with his fears
and talking to the image
of Death. This contrast
between two worlds,
designed to be unsettling
though sometimes not
subtle enough to feel
coherent, provides a
sinister undercurrent of
evil foreshadowing, and
attempts to lay bare the
fears within each human
being. The reconciliation
of these opposing forces
finds itself in the rambling
speech of a joyful Ekdahl
as he beholds his newborn
daughter: “It is necessary
and not in the least bit
shameful to take pleasure
in the little world - good
food, gentle smiles, fruit
trees in bloom, waltzes.”
Just as the dead remain
in our minds, in the play
they appear as stage
figures. Alexander’s
father returns as a serene
white-suited apparition,
his brutal stepfather as a
Grim Reaper. In each case
we are left wondering
as to whether these are
simply representations of
traumatic grief or fear, or
whether the supernatural
is an element of reality
in the plot. We are left
unsure as to where the
division between imagi-
nation and reality lies in
Alexander’s mind. The
ambiguity is concluded
with a quote from Johann
August Strindberg’s A
Dream Play: “Everything
can happen. Everything
is possible and probable.
Time and space do not
exist. On a flimsy frame-
work of reality, the imagi-
nation spins, weaving new
patterns.”
The stage adaptation of Ingrid Bergman’s semi-autobiographical work “weaves new patterns”.

FANNY AND
ALEXANDER
Summer and Smoke sizzles with spectacular sentiment
in stunning revival
I
t is a time-tested
dichotomy – the
body versus the soul,
the mind, with its
emotions and intellect,
versus the body’s sensual
physical pleasures. The
battle between the two
is the focus of one of
Tennessee Williams’
earliest and rarely-per-
formed plays, Summer
and Smoke. In a stunning
new revival by young di-
rector Rebecca Frecknall,
Williams’ lesser-known
play is performed in its
full emotional intensity,
successfully drawing
tension out throughout the
three hours.
Patsy Ferran delivers a
brilliant performance as
Alma, a pastor’s daughter
and singing teacher
whose prudish, formal
upbringing leads her to
suppress her long-time
love for childhood friend
and trainee doctor John
Buchanan, eschewing
physical pleasures for
spiritual and intellectual
fulfilment. This unde-
clared love nearly drives
her mad, and it is this
unspoken tension that
Ferran embodies so well.
Alma’s nervous laugh
and formal diction serve
to hide the emotions that
are churning inside her.
John, on the other hand,
represents the body in
all its physicality – the
fact that he is a doctor,
interested in all the guts
and ‘ugly things’ that
are inside our bodies, is
contrasted with Alma’s
spiritual background.
Matthew Needham, who
plays John, has a stare
so intense that it almost
seems he can see right
through Alma and into
the turmoil of unfulfilled
desire.
Originally called
The Anatomy Chart,
Williams’ play is full of
symbolism and contrasts.
The anatomy chart hangs
in John’s office, and in
one scene he grabs Alma
and makes her look at
the chart, telling her that
there is nothing inside
her but organs hungry
for food, knowledge and
sex – there is none of this
‘soul’ that she repeatedly
mentions. John embraces
this version of the body,
and seeks immediate grat-
ification for his desires,
spending every night at the
casino, and sleeping with
Rosa, the casino owner’s
beautiful daughter.
Williams is known for
his concept of ‘plastic
theatre’: favouring a
more malleable theatrical
process that relies less on
realism and more heavily
on the effect of sound,
colour, movement and
lighting to create evoc-
ative images on stage.
Frecknall developed this
concept beautifully in
this production, with fluid
scene changes on the same
set created using these
extra-textual elements
alone.
The set itself was
fascinating: nine pianos,
stripped bare so one can
see the strings inside, are
arranged in a semicircle
bordering a dusty space.
The cast play on these
pianos from time to time to
create atmosphere -Angus
MacRae’s score comple-
ments and accentuates the
tension and emotions per-
fectly. Dissonant sounds
clashing among the pianos
bring out Alma’s clashing
inner turmoil, while
grand, harmonised motifs
accompany major scenes
and emotional intensity.
Furthermore, the use of
light was integral to the
show and was cleverly in-
tegrated into the piano set.
In an impressive touch,
fireworks were represent-
ed by lights running across
the piano strings while
gentle bursts of light rose
behind the pianos. Indeed,
the light and sound
design, and the flexibility
of a cast moving among
pianos making music that
threads seamlessly in and
out of the scenes, is a
unique touch that respects
Williams’ style.
The shooting of John’s
father, a respected doctor,
leads to a dramatic turn
of events as John goes
off to finish his father’s
good work, while Alma,
tortured by her conflicting
values and desires, with-
draws from the outside
world. When they meet
again, Alma has changed.
She is now ready to
embrace her desires – the
old Alma, the spiritual,
sexually-repressed Alma,
is gone, she says. ‘The girl
who said ‘no’– she doesn’t
exist anymore, she died
last summer – suffocated
in smoke from something
on fire inside her.’
The idea of smoke,
its ethereal, ephemeral
quality, is stylistically
important in the play,
as is the fiery quality of
summer. Alma’s previous
self goes up in smoke,
but so do her hopes and
desires: because after the
shooting John has changed
as well, developing a
more spiritual outlook on
life. He now views his
relationship with Alma
as a spiritual connection,
and attributes his change
to something she has
inspired. She has become,
to him, untouchable like
the angel of the fountain
under which they meet in
the first scene.
This production of
Summer and Smoke is
excellent all round, and
rightly puts the play out
there again in an impres-
sive revival with a stellar
cast, visionary direction
and innovative design.
