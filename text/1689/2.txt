Degree courses to
be rated individually
in extension of the
Teaching Excellence
Framework.
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
D
egree courses
are to be rated
on teaching
quality in
an extension of the
Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF). In
addition to rating each
university as a whole,
individual subjects will
now be categorised as
gold, silver, or bronze.
The ten week consulta-
tion launched earlier this
week by the Department
for Education (DfE) is a
response to criticisms that
current TEF rankings do
not reflect the variation
in teaching quality across
different courses offered
by each university.
Universities minister
Sam Gyimah said: “Uni-
versities will no longer be
able to hide if their teach-
ing quality is not up to the
New strategy for sports at Imperial unveiled
and new opportunities
for both student and
staff bodies. It has put
forward six objectives,
including creating added
value for the College,
increase activity lev-
els across all College
bodies, and improve
efficiency.
A price review of all
sport facilities, a restruc-
turation of the student
sport governing body, and
the introduction of a new
activity tracking app have
been set to take place in
the first six months. The
strategy is set to extend
over a period of four
years.
A single sport commit-
tee is set to be put in place.
Notably, the committee
will seek to homogenize
representation of sports
clubs: in an effort to lower
costs, as well as reviewing
the prices, the partnership
will tender the Ethos gym
and will seek out a single
sportswear supplier for
all sports clubs. Transport
will be restructured, with
coaches made available
for all performance clubs
in the second year. A code
of conduct will be put in
place for all sports clubs
and their members, while
a charter outlining the ex-
pectations for sports and
physical activities will be
created.
The partnership wishes
to play a significant
part in the college wide
implementation of the
‘five ways of wellbeing’
programme. There is also
a wish to increase the
college’s standing in the
British University and
College Sport (BUCS)
ranking: the goal is to
reach at least 15th
place
by the end of the strategy.
Imperial’s current ranking
is 17th
, behind Stirling and
Manchester at 16th
and
15th
place respectively.
Will Hollyer, the Head
of Sports at Imperial said:
"This strategy, and the
fundamental changes it
brings to sport and physi-
cal activity at the College,
has the potential to make
a sustainable and positive
impact on the lifestyles,
experience and wellbeing
of our people for the
better."
The new strategy
comes after talks of a
shake-up of sports at
Imperial last year by the
Union, amidst criticism
of Sport Imperial for its
poor communication and
services. The then-Dep-
uty President (Clubs and
Societies) James Cox
said: “This aims to solve
the root cause of a large
proportion of our issues
surrounding sport at
Imperial, namely commu-
nication and transparency
over decisions and the
complexity of processes”.
world-class standard that
we expect.
“The new subject-level
TEF will give students
more information than
ever before...This will
help applicants make
better choices, and ensure
that more students get
the value for money they
deserve from higher edu-
cation,” he added.
In addition to the new
TEF ratings, Gyimah is
launching an open data
competition to develop
apps designed to help
prospective students
make their decision. Tech-
nology companies and
coders will have access
to the government’s
Longitudinal Education
Outcomes dataset, which
contains information such
as employment and salary
up to ten years after grad-
uating. Gyimah said the
competition will “harness
the creativity and enter-
prise of coders and tech
businesses to create new
tools to help applicants
get value for money”.
Imperial, which is one
of 50 higher education
institutes taking part in
the pilot scheme, received
a gold rating when the
first TEF results were
released in June 2017. The
College’s performance
in individual subject
league tables however has
been more questionable,
with Physics at Imperial
falling to 30th
place in The
Guardian’s 2018 league
tables. College analysis
at the time claimed this
low ranking was partly
because The Guardian
does not include research
impact in its analysis.
The subject-level TEF
will deliver its objective
of “revealing which uni-
versities are coasting or
relying on their research
reputation” by analysing
student feedback, drop-
out rates, and graduate
outcomes. These metrics
have previously attracted
criticism (Felix 1676).
The next TEF ratings
are due to be published
this summer.
When students were
asked for their opinions
on the TEF, one of the
major issues was that a
gold university might
offer bronze courses
and vice versa. Rolling
out the TEF to subject
level will help to allay
these concerns but does
nothing to tackle fears
that prospective student
will be put off applying
to certain courses because
of their ratings. Research
indicates that this will
affect BAME applicants
the most.
The subject-level TEF
may also be a way for the
government to get tuition
fee changes in through
the back door. Under
the original proposals,
universities with a higher
TEF rating would be
allowed to raise tuition
fees in line with inflation.
Following last year’s
general election however
Theresa May announced
that fees would be capped
at £9,250 until 2019.
Last month education
secretary Damian Hinds
said there should be
greater variation in tuition
fees, with the cost of indi-
vidual degrees linked to
their value “to our society
as a whole”. Fees for arts
and social sciences could
be cut, reflecting the lower
earnings arts graduates
typically earn compared
to those studying sciences.
Former education
secretary Justine Green-
ing, whom Theresa May
removed from her cabinet
post shortly before the
announcement was made,
highlighted the risks of
the proposal.
Speaking on Peston
on Sunday at the time,
Greening said: “The thing
that matters is social mo-
bility and making sure we
don’t end up with a system
where young people from
more disadvantaged
backgrounds feel they
ought to do one of the
cheaper degrees, rather
than doing the agree they
want that will unlock their
potential.”
This is particularly true
of Imperial, which was
recently revealed to be the
most unequal university
in the UK, due to the addi-
tional financial pressures
of living in London.

How far does Imperial have to
go?
O
ver the past
couple of
months, Felix
have been run-
ning a survey into campus
sexism. You may have
seen some of our beautiful
posters around campus,
designed by our incred-
ibly Arts Editor Indira.
There were a number of
reasons I wanted to run
such a survey: firstly this
year will have marked
three years since the
‘Misogyny at Varsity’ in-
cident, where the Imperial
Women’s Rugby team
were appallingly treated,
in a display of sexism that
showed how little many
in society value women’s
sports teams.
That year was the first
year I was involved with
Felix, and I can remember
what the mood was in
the office and on campus
when the story broke: one
of anger and frustration.
Since then we’ve had
Imperial’s Institutional
Culture Review, which
foundproblemsoncampus
with competitiveness and
a lack of support. In both
instances, the College
held up their hand, and
promised to change. One
of the reasons to do this
survey was to see whether
that change has been
delivered.
The second main
reason to do the survey
stemmed from speaking to
friends and acquaintances
about their experience
at Imperial. I realised
I couldn’t think of any
woman I was friends with
at Imperial who wasn’t
able to recount some kind
of anecdote where she
was made to feel small,
or unworthy, or uncom-
fortable, on account of
their gender. Not one.
Everyone had an example,
whether it was being told
they should wash up the
beakers in their chemistry
lab because they were a
woman, or being catcalled
by random men at sports
night. This survey, was
in part, a chance to give
people a voice.
Simone Weil once
wrote “the love of our
neighbour in all its
fullness simply means
being able to say ‘What
are you going through?’”
I like to think Felix exists
to give a voice to the
students here at Imperial,
and the chance to speak
their truth, to say what
their experience has been
like. By all accounts, the
results of the survey show
this experience is not a
happy one for many.
Is it a truly accurate
account of life at
Imperial? No. The survey
was self-selecting, and
– as you might imagine
– those who were most
unhappy were more likely
to contribute. The reality
is probably not quite
as bleak as the survey
makes it seem, but even
if only a small number of
students are having these
experience, it’s still far
too many.
The College and the
Union are both trying to
make things better; the
College, in particular,
have been making real
efforts to get more women
into academia, and when
I sat down with Stephen
Curry – Assistant Provost
(Equality, Diversity, and
Inclusion) – he outlined
some of the things the
College have put in place
to address the issues.
While these will lead to
changes on campus, the
survey shows we have a
long way to go. Hopefully
we’ll get there, sooner
rather than later.
