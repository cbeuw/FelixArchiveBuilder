China’s House of Cards – The rise of Xi
Jingping as China’s President for life
I
n 1911, the Wuchang
Uprising brought
down the Qing
Dynasty, thus bring-
ing to an end the longest
continuous imperial civ-
ilization of 8,000 years.
One of the most powerful
dogmas perpetrated by the
ancient Mandarins that
allowed the firm rule of
the emperors was the idea
that the emperors had a
Mandate of Heaven. This
proposition held that ulti-
mate power resided in the
mind and body of the one
legitimate ruler of China,
blessed by the gods.
Whilst much has
changed in the hundred
years of republicanism in
China, both the Guomin-
dang (GMD) and even
the atheistic Communist
Party of China (CCP)
have over the years
adopted the Mandate from
Heaven. After the inaugu-
ral (but brief) presidency
of Sun Yat Sen and the
turbulent war lord era,
both the CCP, led by Mao
Zedong, and the GMD,
led by Chang Kei Shek,
morphed into dictatorial
rulers. However, after the
deaths of these authoritar-
ian figures, both in China
and Taiwan, measures
were taken in succeeding
decades to prevent a future
leader adopting a one-man
authoritarian rule.
In large parts, the
success of China in the
last thirty years can be
attributed to its efficient
political administration by
a collective of technocrats
in the upper echelons of
the Communist Party.
With strict ten-year term
limits, generational lead-
ership changes have been
brought forth regularly
without turmoil and strife.
However, over the
course of last week, these
vestiges on the limitations
of power within the Com-
munist Party of China
were broken up by the
most powerful leader of
modern China since Mao.
President Xi-Jinping,
in a naked power grab,
successfully abolished
the long standing con-
vention of a two term
limit, thus paving the
road to becoming Presi-
dent-for-Life.
In an emotionless and
bureaucratic display of
orderly change, the stony-
eyed President introduced
and proposed the motion
(lifting term limits) to
the National People’s
Congress which in a
Stalinist manner passed
unanimously. Remarka-
bly, this blatant disregard
for tradition surprised
very few, considering
the steps Xi Jingping has
taken since assuming the
presidency. The son of
a surviving member of
Mao’s calamitous Long
March (Xi Zongxun), Xi
Jingping descends from
political royalty and his
accession to the politburo
in 2007 signalled the
inevitability of him suc-
ceeding Hu-Jintao.
Since taking power, the
CCPhas already conferred
the fictitious title of “core
leader” thus elevating him
to a previously non-ex-
istent pedestal – a move
eerily similar to Deng
Xiaoping (the architect
of the Tiananmen Square
massacre) being given
the title “paramount
leader”. Furthermore, in
an unprecedented move,
Xi-Jingping incorporated
“his political thought”
into the Constitution with
his name embedded into
the governing document,
which his two immediate
predecessors were not
able to do for themselves.
The first of the fourteen
points which constitutes
the newly inserted guiding
principles of Xi Jingping
for the CCP states,
“Ensuring Communist
Party of China leadership
over all forms of work in
China”. This destroys any
hope of democracy taking
root in China any time
soon.
President Xi is probably
the most powerful
leader in the world, and
will remain so for the
foreseeable future due to
China’s geo-political and
economic pre-eminence
and the absence of internal
opposition. Recent years
have witnessed a purge
of dissenting leaders
within the party, all under
the guise of rooting out
corruption. However,
very few are fooled by the
ostentatious show trials
condemning past leaders,
while Xi Jingping’s inner
circle amassed their
wealth. This is dishearten-
ing to all those who value
liberal democracy. With a
potential unofficial presi-
dent for life, the argument
that greater economic

How the Chinese President broke the longstanding rule of a two-term limit for Chairmanship
of the Communist party and the dire consequences it entails.

Life”
integration with the west
and free market capitalism
would lead to an inevi-
table democratization of
China has ultimately been
silenced. Moreover, if his
policies in the recent past
can be taken as a predictor
of the future, a more
hostile and hawkish China
will surface.
Xi-Jingping showed the
entire world his ambiv-
alence to the rule of law
and democracy when he
took a hard-line approach
to Hong Kong in the
summer of 2014, breaking
the long held Chinese
commitment to universal
suffrage in the Special
Administered Region. By
adding the caveat that any
candidate wishing to be in
the ballot for Chief-Ex-
ecutive (yes, that is what
they call their Mayor in
Hong Kong) must first
receive the blessing from
Beijing, which handpicks
the candidates the people
of Hong Kong can choose
from, the promise of uni-
versal suffrage enshrined
inHongKong’sBasicLaw
Article 45 was nullified.
When Hong Kong was
handed over by the British
to China in 1997, it was
preceded by decades of
negotiations which gave
assurances to the British
Government and most
importantly to the people
of Hong Kong regarding
protections to civil rights.
Xi-Jingping’s refusal to
accept any opposition in
Hong Kong to greater
integration resulted in
cast iron promises from
the Chinese state. Danger-
ously, the mainland gov-
ernment actively pushed
for extreme police action
to quash the non-violent
2014 Umbrella Revolu-
tion by using pepper spray
and acts of violence.
For sixteen of the last
twenty centuries, China
has consistently been in
the top two with regards
to GDP. To Xi Jingping,
the rise of China is simply
the restoration of the
natural order. In fact, the
Mandarin term for China,
“zhōng-guó”, derives its
name from the idea that
China is at the “centre of
civilization”. Thus Xi-
Jingping has endeavoured
to assert China’s pre-em-
inence to the world using
both soft and hard power.
Xi-Jingping under-
stands that China is at
a cross-road. Slowing
economic growth, rising
debts, and other internal
problems like environ-
mental pollution have
the potential to unravel
the CCP’s grip on power
by a growing dissatisfied
middle class. Xi-Jingping
has effectively used
populist economic
measures to meet the
growing aspirations of
China’s middle class. For
years now, resentment
has grown in China over
poor air quality due to the
country’s rapid industrial-
isation. President Xi has
effectively responded to
this challenge by investing
billions into green energy
sources, such that China is
now the largest producer
of newly-added renewa-
ble energy. Through his
One-Belt initiative, the
Chinese government has
sustained (by increasing
its national debt) millions
of infrastructure jobs. Fur-
thermore, the initiative,
which aims to recreate
the ancient silk road, has
increased China’s profile
internationally. The rise
of China has collided with
Xi-Jingping’s political
rise, which has meant dire
consequences for China’s
neighbours. In foreign
policy, Xi Jingping has
stepped up China’s rapid
remilitarisation with
specific attention given
to the South China Sea.
By propping up artificial
islands and laying claim
to the territorial waters of
sovereign neighbouring
states, President XI has
indicated China will take
an aggressive approach
to establishing regional
hegemony over the United
States.
For much of China’s
history, instead of
external threats, internal
civil wars have been the
source of bloodshed and
chaos that have weakened
and replaced one gov-
erning power by another.

the Taiping Rebellion
resulted in the deaths of
30 million Chinese (more
than the total casualties
of World War One).
China is a geographically
and culturally diverse
political entity unrivalled
by any western nation.
Succeeding generations
of Chinese leaders have
feared this unity would be
broken if greater freedoms
were given to the masses
due to resentment over
an unequal upliftment
by China’s economic
rise. Xi-Jingping’s father
who was a political
leader under Mao saw
the horrors of the Great
Leap Forward (which
killed 20 million from
famine) and the Cultural
Revolution (which
stunted the intellectual
development of millions
of Chinese children).
The Chinese have a long
memory – there won’t
ever be a newer iteration
of Mao’s Little Red Book.
Xi Jingping is a Frank
Underwood-esque brutal
pragmatist who is less
driven by ideology than
realism. President Xi is
more ideologically akin
to Deng Xio-Ping in
believing that “it doesn’t
matter if a cat is black or
white, so long as it catches
mice”. However, through
this blatant power move,
President Xi has shown
his willingness to sacrifice
constitutional norms for
greater stability.
The ancient Chinese
had a curse: “may he
live in interesting times”.
Well, like it or not these
are interesting times.
The developing world in
Africa, Latin America,
and Asia, which has been
suppressed for the last two
hundred years is finally
awaking from its long
slumber.
The allure of estab-
lishing a strong man to
the Chinese political
establishment is clear, as
it would assist in guiding
China through these
transformative times. Xi-
Jingping has gambled that
the many problems facing
China can only be solved
by establishing a strong
authoritarian leader, un-
encumbered by short-ter-
mism. To all those who
are friends of China, we
wish China all the best.
However, to those of
us who also value the
importance of democracy
and liberty, it would be a
sad proposition if China’s
rise can only be propelled
through authoritarianism.
