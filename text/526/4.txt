Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Admiral
of the Fleet, was murdered on August 28th
by an I.R.A. bomb which exploded on his
boat " S h a d o w V." His grandson Nicholas,
aged fourteen, and a seventeen-year-old
boatman were also tragically killed, and his
daughter's mother-in-law the Dowager
Lady Brabourne died later in Sligo
hospital.
Mountbatten and his family were on their
annual visit to his Irish home, Classiebawn
Castle, w h i c h is twelve miles from the
border with Northern Ireland. At the time of
t h e e x p l o s i o n , t h e b o a t w a s in
M u l l a g h m o r e harbour, and local people
over a mile away heard the roar of the
explosion. M a n y expressed surprise that
there were any survivors at all, because the
boat disintegrated completely. A trade
union official from the area s u m m e d up the
general public's reaction with "What they
(the IRA) do in the name of Ireland makes
me ashamed to be called an Irishman."
"At its heart,
for all the
ceremonial, it
was a family
funeral for a
man who was
murdered"

The seventy-nine year old Earl had had a
dazzling and varied career.
In July, 1965, he retired as Chief of the
Defence Staff, and was made a member of
the Order of Merit. He was the last Viceroy
of India and the first Governor-General of
the new D o m i n i o n , now the Republic.
He served in the Royal Navy during both
world wars, where his personal charm and
powers of leadership gained him m u c h
admiration - as an able seaman w h o had
served under him put it " L o r d Louis was
something special. We would have
f o l l o w e d h i m to h e l l a n d b a c k . "
A great-grandson of Queen Victoria and
an uncle of Prince Philip, he was born at
Frogmore House, Windsor in 1900. By
1916 he had passed through O s b o r n e and
Dartmouth, and during the first World War
he served on H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Q u e e n
E l i z a b e t h a n d i n s u b m a r i n e s .
After the war, Mountbatten specialised
in radio c o m m u n i c a t i o n s , and invented a
device enabling ships to keep station
which became standard in the Royal Navy.
He became Fleet Wireless Officer of the
Mediterranean Fleet in 1931, and in 1937
was promoted as youngest captain.
During the early part of the s e c o n d
World War, he c o m m a n d e d H M S Kelly and
the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla. At this time he
had the unique honour of holding the
ranks of A c t i n g Vice-Admiral, Lieutenant-
General and Air Marshal simultaneously.
In the s u m m e r of 1943, he was appointed
Supreme C o m m a n d e r in S o u t h East Asia.
He c o n d u c t e d a campaign described by Sir
Winston Churchill as "the greatest
collision which has yet taken place on land
with J a p a n . " The surrender of J a p a n e s e
troops followed the dropping of atomic
b o m b s on H i r o s h i m a and Nagasaki.
When it was decided in 1947 to grant
independence to India, Mountbatten was
entrusted with the task of transfering
power.
After leaving India in 1948, he was
promoted Vice-Admiral in 1949, A d m i r a l in
1953 and Admiral of the Fleet in 1956.
He was made a Viscount in 1946, and
Earl Mountbatten and Baron R o m s e y in
the following year.
In recent years, Mountbatten has helped
raised large s u m s of money for children's
charities, working with organisations s u c h
as the Variety C l u b .
The Queen led the nation's mourning at
the Earl's funeral service, w h i c h took place
in Westminster A b b e y on September 5th. It
was a solemn and moving occasion, full of
the pageantry and ceremonial that
Mountbatten had loved s o m u c h . The

hundred people, including every member
of the Queen's family and many foreign
kings and princes w h o had c o m e to pay

of B u r m a and a contingent of survivors
from H M S Kelly, which was sunk off Crete
in 1941. M a n y in the congregation were on

Navy gun carriage pulled by sailors.
Tremendous dignity and control was
shown, throughout the ceremony, by the
Royal Family w h o s e sense of loss at the
outrageous killing of the man they knew as
" U n c l e D i c k i e " is shared by the whole
nation, grieving at the death of "so rare a
