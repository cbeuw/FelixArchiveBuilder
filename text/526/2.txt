Don't all cheer, as R o n says that in spite of his s o a k i n g
o n S h r o v e T u e s d a y , plus all the m i c k e y taking, h e is very

T h e National Westminster B a n k h a s d e c i d e d to give
R o n promotion a n d have a p p o i n t e d T o m Cottrell in his
place.
Like R o n , T o m will be available in the S u b - B r a n c h to
give a d v i c e o n Wills, Tax, Insurance, etc. It is e m p h a s i s e d
that y o u don't have to be a c u s t o m e r or a m e m b e r of the
M i n i n g Faculty to pick T o m ' s brains.
In parting, R o n wishes to thank e v e r y o n e for the
friendship he has received during his stay a n d asks that
this n o w be p a s s e d on to T o m Cottrell.
