Plans to make Student Union
Membership voluntary have been given
in a press release from the Bow Group -
an independent conservative research
group. It is also proposed to curb Union
control over their funds from LEA's.
Due partly to claims of misappro-
priation of funds by left-wing leaders,
( i n c l u d i n g g i v i n g c a s h to s u c h
o r g a n i z a t i o n s as the I R A ) the
Government is considering removing
control of about £20M from the Unions
by giving the choice whether or not to
join college unions.
The Bow Group issued a statement
saying 'closed shop student unionism is
incompatible with a free society
A u t o m a t i c m e m b e r s h i p g i v e s
monopoly rights to a single student
union in a university. We consider such a
monopoly to be highly undesirable'.
In the editorial under the heading
leader 'The closed Quad' in The Daily
Telegraph (Wed, August 29) the editor
wrote 'Part of the problem is that in most
institutions of further education the
student's unions operate facilities such
as bars and resturants. There is no
logical reason why they should do so:
at Oxford and Cambridge these facilities
are o p e r a t e d by the c o l l e g e s
themselves, and the students are not
notably deprived thereby.'
The unions have also been critized for
s u s t a i n i n g f u l l - t i m e ' o f f i c i a l s '
(sabbaticals) for years on end claiming
that 'long suffering' LEA's are at present
required to pay for perpetual students.
The e x a m p l e of Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
president of N U S is given.
For the N U S Dave Aaronovitch (the
national treasurer) said: 'Voluntary
membership could create the conditions
that would turn unions in elitist bastions
of extremism, exactly opposite to the
i n t e n t i o n of the B o w G r o u p ' .
Concerning the allegations of mis-
a p p r o p r i a t i o n of f u n d s a N U S
spokesman said ' they' are unwarrented
scare mongering. They're completely
untrue'.
There have also been rumours that the
means tested grant system may be
phased out with the introduction of a
loan scheme, as is the case in the USA.
Under this scheme the government
would loan money to students and
would have to be payed back at a later
date. Such a scheme is planned to make
those students who emmigrate soon
after g r a d u a t i o n p a y for t h e i r
education.
Printers refuse to print Rag Mag
The Rag Mag has been rejected by the
printers because of its' obscene content.
The, not unexpected, news was greeted
by comments of ' I told you so' from
students who had previewed the
magazine.
The printers are trying to find another
firm to take on the job of printing the Rag
Mag. They hope that other units will be
less sensitive to the content of Steve
Marshall's latest work.
