The past year w i l l not be recorded
In the annals of Imperial College as
s truly outstanding, but nevertheless
i t was not a year without highlights.
We had a fine team of union officials,
that had several storms to weather
during the year; with the eloquent
Richard "Tiny" Garnett as President,
and his henchman John Bell as Union
Secretary.
On nearly every Saturday of the
session there i s a dance (HOP!) where
after paying the requisite sum you
can spend the evening dancing with the
women of your choice. The band i s
usually very good providing music for
both "hepcats" and "squares". The
quality of the women present i s good,
and the quantity sufficient. Each of
the three colleges also holds an
Evening Dress Dance (don't be pertur-
bed by the heading).
By now you are probably thinking
that college l i f e i s a l l beer and vomer,
for here are a few extra ourrioular
activities. The Dramatic Society
gave a very polished performance of
the difficult Shakespeare production
"Taming of the Shrew" and also had
several play-readings during the ses-
sion. ^Their trip to Northern
Ireland i s reported i n this edition).
It i s probably apparent to you
that most of the activities that the
college takes part i n , usually have a
string of superlatives attached.
Host of the things we do are suc-
cessful. It oan be argued, that
the men at the top are the ones that
count, but without support they could

In the mascot f i e l d "Boanerges",
the City and Guilds 1901 James and
Brown, affectionately known as Bo
(not to be confused with a well known
adverb) completed yet another success-
ful Brighton Run, but has since ran
into mechanical trouble and ia at
present off the road. Whenever the
bell of a fire-engine was heamd in
the neighbourhood of the college you
oould reckon on i t being something to
do with R.C.S. Either they had
blown yet another hole in their build-
ing or else, they were giving their
1916 Dennis Fire Engine, "Jesebel"
a t r i a l outing. The third member of
the heavy brigade, the R.S.M.'a
tractor engine "Clementine" has
unfortunately contracted boiler trou-
ble. As these three vehicles
would be rather awkward to carry
about, each of the constituent col-
leges has a smaller more manageable
mascot. Mines with a Hiohelin man,
"MitoH"; the R.C.S. has an outsise
thermometer (not to be confused with
the proverbial daffodil!) named
"Theta"; and Guilds who have an
outsixe spanner - this was last heard
of i n the vicinity of Snowdonia, and
was the highest object south of the
border.
During the term the College
acquired several ether college mascots,
ranging from the N.E.C. "Carrot",
to the Unicorn from Bedford (which was
christened Raphael during a Guilds
Union meeting). The fresher must
not think that a l l such"raids" are
successful, the Sandhurst Cannon s t i l l
remains at the R.H.A. after several
attempts.
In the freshers early days at
I.C. he will -wvacubtedly hear the word
"Carnival" uttered. Some say the
word with awe; some with knowledge-
able forboding; most with pure lust.
A Carnival i s what YOU make i t . Last
year R.C.S. commenced the revelry with
"CUBANTICS". ' A lively carnival i t
was spoiled by the persistant attention
of gate crashers. The cabaret was
good, but contained humour of a l i t t l e
too coarse a nature. Guilds "Pirates
Paradise" was perhaps the f i n e s t
ex.'triple of coordinated planning that
the College has seen. The idea of
converting the Concert H a l l intd a
pirate galleon f i l l e d even the great-
est pessimists with doubt, but on the
day they proved a credit to designers
and bulders. The oabajset was
extremely talented, and despite
R.C.S.interuptions (Jealousy maybe!)
put over a very good performance.
With Mines Carnival "Me and My Ghoul"
lack of support did not make i t the
success that i t might have been.
Due to enforced police regulations
I.C. celebrated Nov. 5th, as at other
years, with a bonfire and firework
display at the sports ground at Har-
lington. Although the firework dis-
play oould have been organised a
l i t t l e better, and despite the
"Moon Shot" failure, the dancing and
other forms of entertainment were
enjoyed by a l l . I am pleased to
report that the three policemen who
were admitted to hospital, have a l l
fully recovered.
not manage i t . Remember this, for i t
is one facet of the Union that,is
sometimes sadly l a c k i n g . We have
the men and women who have made this
College what i t i s , but this record
oould be improved with support:
WUS CARNIVAL
whether this means spending a few
shillings to listen to a mediocre
performance, or standing watching an
I.C. team i n action, the very fact
that you are there w i l l help the par-
ticipants no end. Other highlights
of the year were the "I.C-U.L.U"
organised W.U.S. Carnival, and the
election of Mr. ICWA, an honour whioh
finally befell Mr. Tony "Tub" Ewart.
