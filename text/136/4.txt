"Freshers" are always welcomed at
I,C< aa they tend to vitalise the "hlood
ayatea" of the College as opposed to the
older members of the Union who provide
the oontinuity and solidarity essential
to College l i f e . At the commencement
of a new session l i f e i s heotio enough
for even the established inhabitant,
but i t i s infinitely worse far the
Fresher. Having recovered from the
"Pep" talks and free buffets, he i s a
l i t t l e confused. We a l l went through
this stage; but after a few weeks the
strangeness wears off, and the Fresher
oan begin to put work and pleasure i n
the right perspective.
To add a touch of colour to the
picture, Freshers, you have been lucky
enough to come to the finest college
in the country, a college with a long
and proud reputation. Whether this
reputation was won on the foothills 'of
the Himalayas or the playing fields of
Harlington, i t i s up to you to maintain
the standard set, and do a l l i n your
power to enhance the position we now
hold. A word of warning though, this
reputation has not been built up by the
men whose only record i s of catching
the 5 o'clock train to GUILDFORD, and
whose main use for the Union was to
obtain suitable repast at lunchtime.
We do not ask rauoh, f i r s t a l i t t l e time
and a l i t t l e enterprise, w i l l win our
welcome unreservedly. A last word on
the subject; IC men give of their best
to the Union, primarily because i t i s
THEIR Union; we are a l l part of i t , we
a l l benefit i n one way and another from
i t j so let everyone contribute to i t .
This edition of BSXIX as with
its predecessors of other years has been
produced for the FRESHER, henoe the i n -
clusion of RETROSPECT 1958 and guides to
the various sports grounds. Unfortunately
several of our usual features are missing.
2he principal one of these i s the "Letteas"
page. FELIX i s the most accessible forum
to everybody. So use i t to express your
opinion. I f this opinion oannot be con-
densed to a letter, i t can be Inoluded in
"VIEWPOINT". FELIX i s written by the UNION
and other members of the FELIX Staff have
not the time or the inclination to go
around collecting material, so that we
always need contributions of news, value
from as many sources as possible. Do not
lesitate to write i n .
SELH w i l l continue to come out
on every alternate Friday throughout
the Session and contributions should be
in by the preceding Friday. Thus, for
next issue, due on OCT. 16th, write i n
by OCT. 9th.

Most freshers, and many who are
net so fresh, may be pussled by refer-
ences on notice boards and elsewhere to
something oalled TOUCHSTONE that i s
b i l l e d ss being held at Imperial College
Field Station, Silwood Park, Surmingdale
Touchstone weekends are held about twice
a t e n i n the beauties of the Berkshire
countryside. They were the brain ohild
SILWOOD PARK
of the late Sir Roderic H i l l , and were
intended as an opportunity for the staff
and students of the College to meet in
informal surroundings. There i s a
theme for each weekend to whioh a guest
speaker pre-eminent in his particular
f i e l d i s invited.
In no circumstances are the
subjects for discussions to be of a
scientific nature, and these meetings
were intended from the start to en-
courage the rationalisation of the
education of members of Imperial
College. In part they are meant to be
the complement of General Studies
Lectures, and thus to enable students
to gain a wider understanding of that
most important faculty of the Human
Mind, that of clear thinking allied with
the ability to express oneself clearly
on Human Problems to other members of
Mankind without difficulty or embarass-
raent.

Members of the Union should be
aware of the security arrangements that
exist in the College. Mr. Henry
(internal 7W or 315) i s a most e f f i c i -
ent security officer to whom any un-
accountable disappearances should be
reported as soon as possible. Lest
property usually finds i t s way to his
office, where he i s only too willing
to help.
