FELIX
PROFILE
Les Allen - President of the
Imperial College Union - your elected
leader and representative - what sort
of man i s he? I won't pretend that ray
ramblings w i l l t e l l you, hut you may
gather some idea.
Five years ago he was a fresher
at I.C. and was as bewildered as any of
our freshers today. He had been born
and educated i n London, and came here to
study Physios.
Now? - he is a research spectro-
scopist, married, and likely to be very
busy i n t h i 3 coming year. This w i l l be
nothing new to him.
During his College career his
principal interests have been debating
and dramatics. In both of these fields
he has excelled, playing the lead i n many
productions, and being a member of the
I.C. team which won the University of
London Debating Trophy last year. During
his final year as an undergraduate he was
Chairman of the Social Clubs Committee -
a responsible position which has provid-
ed him with the administrative experienm
and the knowledge of the running of the
Union, to carry off his present position
in his customary manner.
He hopes to have a l i t t l e time to
indulge i n his extra-College pursuits -
such as watching Millwall and Surrey play
their respective games; enjoying what he
calls "high-brow theatre and low-brow
music"; and fervently joining marches i f
they are i n a good cause.

Before i t was known that the
Phoenix" would not be coming out aa
planned because of the Printing Dispute
the Editor of "Phoenix* asked me to
write a "President's Letter" suggesting
that I might like "to t e l l the Union
what i t might expect to happen during
the ocn&ng session." That letter w i l l
not now be published, but i t i s that
theme that I oon3idor the most profit-
iiole to explore here instead.
1 find i t a difficult theme to
write on because I myself would like to
know what i s likely to happen. It i s ,
of course, true that after many years oi
intensive noise of destruction and cre-
ation of College buildings we are having
the pleasure of seeing some of the new
buildings opening. From the student
viewpoint the most important of these
is Weeks Hall which will increase the
available hostel accommodation consider-
ably. The new Physios building w i l l be
completed and the Mechanical Engineering
Department will be changing i t s home.
The pneumatic d r i l l s w i l l not be s t i l l e d
though for many new buildings have yet
to be started and further old ones des-
troyed.
Everybody I know i s keen that I»G>
should have' a olOsely knit corporate
l i f e with as many students i n residence
as possible. The presence of Weeks Hall
will, I believe, increase the population
i n the Union building during the even-
ings, for the more people there are l i v -
ing i n College the more additional people
there are likely to be spending time
with them. Similarly the Physioists vac-
ating the old R.C.S. building will find
themselves nearer the Union than Ayrton
Hall and w i l l I suspect be changing their
eating and coffee venues. A l l of these
things to one extent or another w i l l be
ohanging l i f e at I.C. One thing i s clear
that whatever may ocour during the coming
year things w i l l not be standing s t i l l .
Always there w i l l be change. Will there
be i n the activities of I.C.U? I have
no idea for i t i s really up to Union m
e
m
-
bers to decide.
Unlike the older universities and
the older degree subjects, where lec-
tures are few and the onu3 of reading is
on the student, Imperial College tends
to be more rigid i n that one has to go
to a considerable number of lectures to
survive from one year to the next. Con-
sequently because of the nature of LC.
a student w i l l acquire a university
education i n a different way from those
at Oxbridge. Indeed there i s a danger
that he might not aoquire one at a l l . I
oonfess that I have l i t t l e time for
childish behaviour i n students or for
students where l i f e i s 1
0 a.nu to 5 p.m.
Neither of these attitudes i s conduoiim
to a University education. I have i n
the past often felt that I.C. lacked an
essential of a real University. It i s
perhaps a hard thing to pin down but
basically i t i s that the outlook i s
shallow and immature. One should not
be afraid to argue, to speak up, to
discuss, to express a view, to listen
and to think i n a University. Univer-
sity should be the stamping ground of
ideas, beliefs and creations. They
should be trampled upon, agreed with,
argued about, discarded, taken up, and
changed. But they must never be ignor-
ed. That is what I want to see at I.C.
I do not honestly believe i t exists at
the moment; but i t should, and must.
How does one bring about that
quality? I'm not entirely sure; such a
feeling comes from deep inside those w
h
o
want i t . But a contribution oan be nede
to i t at least by getting everyone inter-
ested i n the Union. For everyone to
make the deoisions of what they want in
the College. That i s why I say I do not
know what the next year w i l l bring. I f
i t brings with i t a 3erious outlook and
a thoughtful approach and active part-
icipation i n Union meetings then I do
not doubt that much w i l l ocour. It i s
though the Union who must decide not
just Council or myself.
However, to leave the hypothet-
i c a l , one event whioh has been planned
to ocour during the coming session i s
the I.C. Carnival. Instead of joining
the W.U.S. Carnival as during last sess-
ion, I.C. w i l l this year concentrate on
its own Carnival for the f i r s t time. 3
i t hoped to raise money for oharity and
for an I.C. bed at St. George's hospital.
Apart from that and the already estab-
lished events, the future i s i n your
hands. My job as President as I see i t
i s to help to guide your ideas to suo»
oessful conclusions. It oan I think be
a very fine year far I.C.
Los Allen.
