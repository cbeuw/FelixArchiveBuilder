Two other sporting events round
off our year. The only o f f i c i a l rag
day i s held on the afternoon of the
Morphy Cup Raoe. Whilst the three
colleges battle i t out on the river,
S similar but less sportsmanlike
battle i s taking place cn the bank

Field Cup day i s a private
venture within Guilds, i n which the
five departments race against each
other. Thi3 year after the usual
detour through the Serpentine, the
idea was to erect the flag-pole i a a
dustbin behind Guilds. After much
fighting the Mechanicals were de-
clared winners, not beouase they had
suooeeded i n erecting their flag-
pole, but they were nearer to erection
than anyone else.

Chapter 1. (in whioh we learn a l i t t l e
about birds).
The Lesser Pecked Flottsam Flap-
per (Peokus bops, for erudite readers)
i s abroad this month. At regular inter-
vals this speoies ceases to flap and
begins to flop; the smell i s intense.
Perhaps i t i s as well that this speoies
is abroad this month. It is included in
this account however, because i t occurs
sproradically i n East Grinstead. Readers
seeing this very rare migrant should con-
tact their local. From there they should
draught a letter to 'The Tome3', burn i t ,
and memorize the ashes. Throughout the
latter half of September, the L.P.F.F.
passes through a period of constipation,
when nothing but eggs are laid. These are
quite inedible.
Tutamencatenula vulgaris, or to
give i t i t s common name, the Vulgar
Tutamenoatenula, is to be found in large
numbers i n heaps on the ground this month,
This bird has a habit of perching on
Beeoh leaves. Beech leaves f a l l i n Sept-
ember. Thus, this i s a bird which oan
never be distinguished, as i t always occ-
urs i n piles on the ground. It i s about
as fast as i t i s long, and sounds the
same as i t smells. In films this speoies
always presents i t s e l f as a blur, moving
from right to left, or vice versa i f the
film i s shown backwards. It may only be
shot when there i s a fog i n the month.
Finally, this month you should
begin putting out pieces for the Tits;
such nutritive offerings are, amongst
other things, known as Tit Bits. Please
forgive my paronomasia - it's a terrible
disease to suffer from.
