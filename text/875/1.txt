Access Fand, Yoar
Flexible Friend ?
In response to the loss of benefits
to students, with the introduction
of the Poll Tax, the Government
has responded with an access
fund allocation to Universities and
Higher Education establishments
across the country. The fund to
be re-allocated annually is not
meant to replace housing benefit
but is intended, by the r-
Government, to fund students
who would otherwise not come to
University for financial reasons.
In light of this both the NUS and
ULU considered that the money
should be used to support the loss
of benefits.
Out of the £9.5 million put into
the fund, London will receive £2
million, reflecting the higher cost
of living. Imperial College is to
have an allocation of over
£250,000 with a recommended
split of £105,800 to
undergraduates and £153,600 to
postgraduates. The
disproportionate shares, compared
to the eligible number of students
in each category, exists because
of the higher number of self
supporting postgraduates, the
larger number with families, and
because they are not able to
apply for student loans. At
Imperial over a quarter of the
eligible postgraduates fund
themselves.
A working group sat to discuss
the method of distribution
amongst the eligible students and
worked out guidelines to share
the money. The Union were
invited to contribute to the
meeting and a number of the
recommendations were taken on
board. For most students this will
probably mean little or no
money. This will affect those who
receive a grant and are eligible to
take out a student loan.
For undergraduates those with
the most need will benefit first.
This will include such categories
as; self financing; parentally
estranged (no parental
contribution being paid); disabled;
students with families; and single
parent students. If the total
allocation had been split equally
between all the eligible students it
would have only given each of
them £63.26.
The claims procedure will
involve applying to Senior Tutors,
with claims over £500 being
referred to the central committee.
Postgraduates will follow a
different system which will
probably exclude most of those
with SERC awards. The awards
are likely to be larger but fewer
in number. An appeals committee
will exist to allow people to
contest decisions made by the
central committee, or Senior
Tutors.
The Department of Education
has said that "Each institution is
free to decide how to allocate the
total among the eligible students".
The recommended split between
postgraduates and undergraduates
is included in this. Imperial is
planning to move around £30,000
to the undergraduates from the
postgraduates. The committee will
also hold back between 20%
to30% of the total fund until the
middle of the academic year to
allow for students whose
situations alter drastically within
the year.
Imperial College is lucky in
respect that it receives a higher
allocation per eligible student
than any other colleges in
London, and probably the
country. Next year is going to see
some fierce competition during
the battle for higher
re-allocation, although the fund
is supposed to increase with
inflation. Said Benjamin Turner,
Deputy President, "Don't blame
College if you don't get what you
want. It's the bloody
Government's fault.".
Jelly riding out,
John Riding in
After three years service, Adrian
'Jelly' Johnson, the Union Bar
Manager resigned last Friday after
gaining a place at Imperial once
more. Before becoming Bar Manager, he was in the Aeronautical Engineering Depart
ment but dropped out. He now goes on to study Mineral Resource Engineering in the
Royal School of Mines.
His resignation comes at a difficult time for the Union who are in the midst
of recruiting the new Union Manager, a process taking up most of their time.
They also have to consider the appointment of a new Bookstore Manager for
the end of January. It now means that an added and urgent burden exists in
the form of finding a new Assistant Bar Manager by the beginning of the Autumn
term. This in time for the ensuing chaos of Freshers Week.
Mr John Riding, previously the Bar Steward, will replace Jelly as the
Bar Manager, and Tracy Sedgwick will become the Bar Steward.
Dr Finley, Jelly's Senior Tutor in Aeronautics first commenting "What!
He's going back to School" later said that "despite despondency in the
past I wish him all the best now.".
