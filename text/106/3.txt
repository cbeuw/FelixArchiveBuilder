Cosing back froa the Easter Vac,
there have been many changes apparent,
which should nave been seen when we
came at the beginning of the session.
The lawn has now put i n a welcome ap-
pearance, the contractors are moving
the last of their equipment, there i s
definite promise of new furniture i n
the Onion Lounge, and the FELIX room
i s now ready!
This means that now we shall have
an office to which you can bring a l l your
troubles, be they l i t t l e or big ones,
FELIX photographs w i l l also be on sale i n
this room, which i s facing the main stair-
case on the 3rd. floor. There w i l l be
a membf r of the FELIX Editorial Board i n
the office from 1.00p.m. to 2.06p.m. on
each weekday starting today. Also, FELIX
"make-up" w i l l be i n this room every other
Sunday. Anybody who wishes to help with
this i s very welcome, particularly at this
time of the year so that staff can be trained
for next year's production team - for the
producing of FELIX i s a skilled job requiring
a co-ordinated team.
The next issue, the present Editor w i l l
be off on along week-end - a course, we hasten
to add. So, the next issue w i l l be made-up
by next year's Editor with this year's Editor
advising before the event - so don't believe
anything you may read about the latter i n the
next issue.

two lugs above the clock i n the quadrangle for?

Tour Excellency,
This i s a matter of some urgency,
which we feel should be brought to the attention
of your esteemed readers. We are organising a
verv silent protest march at 1.15p.m. today; as-
sembly point outside the Union Archway. Ve w i l l
march past several, convenient -embassies and w i l l
disperse outside a building i n Exhibition Road.
Our protest has the support of a l l shades of
opinion from Eaat to West. We suggest the following
slogans are the most pertinent :-
VE PROTEST I
STOP THEM HOW I
WE DEMAND JUSTICE I
REMEMBER THE LAST TIMS I
THIS CONCERNS TOU I
SEND A GUNBOAT 1
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER t
CONSTITUTION, RESTITUTION, PROTESTATION I
Other appropriate slogans w i l l be welcome. We
know they w i l l be forced to take notice of this,
last the rising tide engulf them.
Ve are yours i n protestation

I.C.Hostel,
Dear Sir,
Without professing to go into detail
(not being qualified enough to do so), as to
which of the tie knots i s better, one cannot
Ignore completely the fact that this particular
aspect of a man's dress has not received tha
same attention within the scholastic walls of
our College, as outside. Though one cannot wait
for the day when "every man, young or old, w i l l
have a personal t i e knot ( and, incidentally,
hair style) suitable to his age, face and charac-
ter" i s i t too much to hope and desire that the
t i a knot, the object of which i s to draw attention
to the face, "the seat of man's character", and
not entirely to conceal the collar stud, w i l l
have our more immediate attention ?

Since woman are aoespted into fsts ©eiieg*
on equal basis with man, why are they 'barred
from tha bar'? This unwritten itt mj softs',
casts a sordid shadow over I.C. bar and i s apt
to aat an outsider's Imagination working aler*
the wrong lines. I as sure that • sale's
privacy w i l l not be endangered i n any way be-
cause women are invited i n by other males for
a drink. The atmosphere and general aspect of
the bar w i l l definitely be lmoroved by their
presence and, whatever i s said against the idea)
i t works perfectly well In pube.
Tours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
I wonder i f you could help me with a
l i t t l e problem I have. When I was at CAG in'51-54,
I was familiar with a ditty which was something
about "We're going to see the Hamburg Zoo". This
i s completely unknown on this side, and I would
like to introduce i t , but find I have almost fox)
gotten i t . Perhaps you and your colleagues could
furnish me with the (authentic) words and tune;
the solo parts are especially important.
I trust "Felix" i s s t i l l i n the best of heajl
and f u l l of fleas - I mean activity.

Dear Sir,
I am rather puzzled by the variations i n
position of SCIEKTIA on the open book of the
I.C. crest. A quick, survey of the Union shows
three distinct schools of thought :- the
SCI-ENTIA S.of T.; the SCIE-NTIA S. of T. the
SCIEN-TIA S. of T.
The followers of the f i r s t have the least
support, their only emblem being the large crest
in the bar. The other two both have more follo-
wers. SCIE-NTIA appears on the stage back cloth,
the new embossed chairs, the pelmet i n the com-
mittee room, on the bust of S i r Otto Beit i n the
archway and on some of the pots. The other pots
belong to the SCIEN-TIA S. of T., with the small
crest behind the bar, the crest over the Union
entrance, the blazer badge and the notepaoer
headings. The large quantities of printed note-
paper and blazer badges sway the count towards
the latter, but i s sheer weight of numbers
enough for this to be accepted as correct?
In these clays of standardisation and mass-
production much individuality i s being lost and
every effort should be made to preserve character,
but surely i n this case the variations are merely
odd and not of an individual character, standard-
isation would therefore be an advantage.
By the way, which i s correct?

(Editor's Note. Our Heraldic correspondent writes
that,having considered fully the merits and
demerits of each of the above versior-.s, and after
having consulted suitable authorities, the
last version is-perhaps less incorrect than the
lst. and 2t.d. versions.)
KEEP OFF THE GRASS'
The College resumed activity this term to
find that the unsightly mess of the quadrangle
had beer, removed and i n i t s place a pleasant
formal garden laid out. There will not b«, i t
seems, any "Keep off the Grass" notices, pre-
sumably since they would not remain i n situ for
long-, but a l l are asked to cooperate i n keeping
the garden i n i t s present condition by adhering
strictly to the paths.
Our tame botanist reports that the trees
planted i n the 'quad' include a Silver Birch
(Betula); a flowering Cherry (which masquerades
under the name of Prunus Cereasus); four Horn-
beams (Carpinus). (Our Racing Correspondent
assures that no similarity i s intended to
the horse which arrived 4th. i n the Derby SUA.
won him 4id last week). An Indian Bean Tree
(Catalpa) w i l l grace the lawn on the Zoology side,
and maybe provide Mr. Mooney with a slight
addition to his nanus. In future years, hostel
residents will bless the foresight of their
predecessors as they ascend the boughs of the
Red Oak, whoaeboughs w i l l perhaps gracefully
brush against the windows of the third floor of
the new hostel.
Princes Gardens nave also been opened "to
members of the College. «
Ho rules have beer, made Tor the use of those
oWrdens, and none should be necessary. Pro-
