This month's "

" does not fall to maintain
the magazine's high literary standard. The ar-
ticles alone are wall worth, the price of the
book. In particular> the articles "Gentlemen
Qualified to Do So " by One of Them, "People
in the News" by George Houghton and "The New
Plague of Egypt" by J.Ventwortk Day make very
entertaining and interesting reading.
It is that other ingredient of the magazine
that lacks quality in this issue. This is, of
course, visual art. Of 17 cartoons only two axe
funny; six are 'corny',_and six are just vulgar
without being funny fas well, Tha remaining three
do not f i t into any of these categories. Of the
usual photography, a selection by Cardaw Robin-
son of the savoir faire sex characterising a
country cottage, a stately home, a Riviera villa
and a penthouse should certainly stimulate
readers to travel. However, Harry Secombe's
choice for "This month's pin-up", the English
starlet Lynn Shaw, is disappointing. A rather
sparsely upholstered coacnwork is not improved
by an unattractive face and facial expression.
These photos are not for the purist. The "Let's
Join the Ladies" no.37 by Vargas does not merit
a place on a hostel bedroom wall this month. It
has been felt for some time that this artist
should take a course in anatomy. Perhaps he
would then get his proportions correct.

Y.H.A. EASTER TOUR
They say that the lake District i s one of the
wettest i n England. I t i s more - i t i s one of the
finest; true, when i t rains i t doesn't skimp matxeri
but when i t i s fine i t i s really blazingly hot, none1
of your dusty, hazy, choking London summer days.
On the whole I suppose the weather was reasona*
ble, abdut four fine days, three very, very, wet
days and about four cold but fine days. We had
about fifteen people on and off, ranging from
twelve at the start of the tour to about eighteen
towards the end, a l l walkers of very varied
walking capability - generally we split into two
or more groups, a "walking party" who used to make
for the biggest f e l l i n sight and slog straight up
i t , and nearly k i l l themselves i n the precess; A
"sleeping party" who used to perform just this
function (in a pub i f wet, and on a patch of bracken'-
i f fine); and a certain couple who used to wander
off hand i n hand over the moors1
Memories and photographs - we have plenty of
these; sore feet and blisters - those also*. But
I think i t was worth i t , the good cancels out the
bad, and the memories last longer than the blisters^
Outstanding were a great day'o traverse of Gable,
Scawfell, and Scawfell Pike i n blazing hot weather,
A dash over the f e l l s i n a howling gale which
ripped a large number of pack a macs to meces*
the time when one of the g i r l s sat down i n a rather
wet bog hole, the send off,we gave to another
couple when they Xeft.
A l l these things, and many others, combined to
give a holiday, which for companionships, scenery,
and sheer change was unexcelled
