WINNER OF BEARD
COMPETrrtON

THE WINNER ROBIN SUTTON
ON MONDAY, THE 25TH. OF MARCH, onlookers i n
the Union Lounge gazed with envious eye at the
collection of facial fungi assembled there.
Even more envious, however, were the expressions
when a f u l l bottle of the best Scotch potato
fermentation appeared on the scene, together,
however, with an enormous shaving brush i n -
scribed with a Felix-type cat. The Board of
Judges took their seats while the Editor enounced
the names of the competitors, whose beards ranged
from a diminutive chin embellishment to a thick,
cave-man-like growth.
The competition was divided into four categor-
ies, together with an over-all winner. After
much deliberation and intensive examination of
each hairy protruberance, the Board declared
Robin Sutton to ba the winner. Amid great ova-
tion, he received the two prizes. They both
came i n useful - while whetting his whistle with
whisky, me warded off would-be drinkers with his
wooden weapon - the Brush.
When half a bottle had been consomed, he very
generously passed the bottle to the judges and
the Editor no comment i
After further consultation, the judges made
tha following awards:
The THICKEST heard: Robin Sutton
The JUnHEST board: Colin Drake
The M
O
S
T AESTHETIC beard: Alan Thomas
The beard WITH THE HOST
SEX-APPEAL: Brian Ellis
The last declslsn was made by the female por-
tion of the Board only - Wendy Pipe ant Elisabeth
Krink, mho called i n Susan Coombs to make a cast-
ing vote, as they ware undecided.
B* this time, tarn contents of the bottle of
llavor sad disappeared, mostly down the throats
Of th. male members of the Board; tads prob-

the e f f e c t s of which were to be seen
throughout the evening.'
The c a b a r e t , as u s u a l , went i t s own
sweet way, d e s p i t e the r e h e a r s a l s and
