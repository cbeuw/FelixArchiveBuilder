IN C O R N W A L L
April 1st. - A l l Fools' Day - and f i r s t nan
to play one of the traditional jokes ins none
other then the College jester, Brian Oggi, who
i s also I.e. Bugger Secretary. His victims
were high spirited rugger players, for whom
ha produced what our correspondent described
as an aged and rattling boneshaker to convey
them on their week-long invasion of Cornwall.
This world-weary wagon managed to reach the
Dorchester Aims, Hook, but shortly afterwards
f i l l e d i t s own interior with choking fumes,
and with the emission of a great column of
steam from i t s radiator and a puddle of o i l
from i t s under-bally, shuddered to a stand-
s t i l l i n the middle of Salisbury Plain. The
driver was undaunted by this apparent disaster
and, after a 40 minute rest, he gently cajoled
his charge for a further mile or so where tha
contents of a cow-trough were poured into the
radiator. The f i r s t half gallon shot straight
out i n the form of superheated steam, but soon
we were off again and reached Falmouth at mid-
night} though not before visiting the famous
Jamaica Inn, where the co-operative and willing
nature of young Cornish womanhood f i r s t came
to the notice of the Vice-Captain and his as-
sociates.;
The f i r s t match, against Falmouth, was
played i n misty and difficult conditions, and
to the undisguised delight of I.C. supporters,
was won by 9 points to n i l . The whole team
played with great spirit and determination and
thoroughly deserved a notable victory. Stone
kicked two penalty goals and began a movement
which provided Berryman with a try on the left.
Those who remembered our defeat two years ago
led an uproarious celebration, which continued
late into, the night at a Falmouth supporters'
club dance.
It was at this dance that the President was
coerced into giving his own rendering of
"Singing The Blues", and was only persuaded to
stop when told by the House Manager that tha
noise might attract the police.
At this function, a frolicsome f i l l y of
Falmouth with, i t was rumoured, the scalps of
many previous visiting captains under her belt,
made passionate advances on the I.C. skipper,
D.M.Thomaa. This stolid example of self-effacing
B r i t i s h manhood at f i r s t seemed hooked - even
to the extent of buying and drinking lemonade!
However later i n the week he produced an ef-
fective hand-off, and completed the tour bat-
tered, beery and bruised, but unconquered.
Ia describing the newt match, against Pen-
zance, your correspondent quotes from the
Western Morning News': "The match between
Penzance and Imperial College, which tha
former won 19-3, was one of the most attractive
seen on the ground for aoma time. The Collage
treated a very good impression by their open
rugby and sound tackling, and well deserved tarn
swmtion they received as they left the f i e l d .
ma visitors ware most unlucky, for after only
three minutes they lost their right-centre.
B.Hearn, with a fractured collar-bone. Although
opposed by • side which contained seven county
players the College vent into their task wits
a w i l l . They were 14 points down at the interval,
but conceded only one further try In the •
closing minutes the College reaped a deserved
reward for their pluck when Stone scored a b r i l -
liant try which was not converted." I t may aaea
invidious to praise Individuals after amch a
splendid team display, but eighteen year old
A.Seed, I.C. 2nd XT scrum-half, rose to the
occasion and played a fine game under pretty
tough conditions.
So to Penryn, where revenge was sought for
a narrow and unlucky defeat two years ago. Alas,
two hard matches had left their mark, and with
one' or two unavoidable team-changes, I.C. had
lost their sparkle and went down i n a cloae
fight 6-0. One member of the party attributed
defeat to the decision to play Stone, with •
broken toe, i n preference to the A I V flp*4amf
who, although) not quite match f i t , at least
boasted an entire skeleton beneath his ample
covering.
The extraordinary proceedings that followed
the Penryn game cannot ba recorded here. They
iincluded a masterly commando raid, whose aim
was to gain entry into a late-drinking estab-
lishment perched on top of a steep h i l l . The
objects of this venture were successfully ac-
complished without loss of l i f e , despite loose
boulders and stinging nettles, and Thomas
became Keeper of the Privy Key. Tou can hear
further details i n the bar.
Thus ended a fine tour with a great s p i r i t .
The writer's only regret i s that B.Stone's
carefully laid plan to get Oggi paralytic and
then cut his hair off could never be implemented.
S Q U A S H C L U B
Once a g a i n i t i s p o s s i b l e to say
t h a t the c l u b l o o k s back on a good
season. With p o t e n t i a l l y one of the
best teams f o r a number of years.
The few f a l l i n g s must be a t t r i b u t e d
