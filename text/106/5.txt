On April 12th. the Rector and certain
members of various engineering departments appeared
in a B.B.C. television programme. This programme
outlined some of the steps being taken to increase
the output of scientists and technologists for
industry and was complementary to this year's
Reith Lectures i n which Sir Edward Appleton
spoke of Industry's growing demands for highly
'brained personnel.
Shots of practical work In progress, filmed
soma weeks before, included a close up of the
Vice-President of Guilds and some unusually
attentive aero students (obviously camera
conscious) diligently talcing lecture notes. The
Sector spoke of the expansion programme at tha
collage and outlined the work already seder
way. The Important position la supplying the
needs of industry held by Imperial Collage,
sow recognised by the government, was
emphasised.

LC. DRAMATIC SOCIETY'S
EASTER PRODUCTION
On March 25th., 26th., and 27th., I .CD .3.
presented, as their second major production i n
the new Union Building, a farcical comedy by
Talbot Rothwell, "Queen Elisabeth Slept Here".
This tells of the misfortunes that befall a young
couple who -buy a tumbledown country cottage and
have to brave the hardships of a rural existence:
as with most farces, the story i s of secondary
importance, and the author uses i t merely as a
framework for a series of comic situations.
While there i s much i n the play which w i l l appeal
to most people with a suitably-developed sense
of humour, there i s also much which can be de-
scribed only as "corny".
The standard of acting was on the whole very
high, though, perhaps not surprisingly with so
many characters, there was a certain amount of
miscasting. The pace of the production was also
good, and the producer, Graham Matthews, must be
congratulated on his handling of the large and
comparatively inexperienced cast.
The actors were well supported by tha
technical departments, and In particular the
many and varied sound-effects helped to create
a suitably rustic' atmosphere. Altogether
an enjoyable evening's entertainment, though
nothing more.
